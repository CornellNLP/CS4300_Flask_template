 Previously on "Heroes Reborn"... 
 Molly's in here somewhere. 
 [guns cock] 
 Well, look what we got here. 
 Run, Jose. Find your uncle! 
 [Taser clicking] 
 Mom, it's okay. 
 [sirens approaching] 
 Mom? 
 Why are we rounding up Evos? 
 To save our species. 
 I can't stop Erica,  but I will not help her kill 7 billion people. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gasps] 
 [alarm sounding] 
 [indistinct chatter over walkie-talkie] 
 What did Molly mean she wouldn't help them kill 7 billion people? 
 What the hell was she talking about? 
 I don't know. 
 We got to find out, and there's one person who has the answers-- your mother. 
 You've seen what she's capable of. 
 We've got to stop her. 
 I've got an idea. This way. 
 All right. 
 [truck horn blaring] 
 So why are we in St. Pierre? 
 Just a stop along the way. 
 Along the way to where exactly? 
 Along your way. 
 You've seen the signs as clearly as I have. 
 I know-- my destiny. 
 I get it. 
 It's not like I don't know how important it is-- world-saving. 
 I just don't know how I'm supposed to do it. 
 I mean, I know a lot of things in theory, but... 
 When the moment comes, you will be ready. 
 I promise. 
 Come. 
 I need you to stay here. I have to meet someone. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 And be vigilant about your powers. 
 No slips. I promise. 
 Good girl. 
 What are they doing here? 
 Some kind of scavenger hunt. 
 Renautas publishes the "Evernow" game, so they're taking photographs of themselves at different locations on the campus. 
 A Japanese gamer named Ren Shimosawa set it up. 
 The girls are dressed as-- Katana Girl. 
 Hmm. 
 Miko Otomo. 
 This is a Trojan horse to get past security. 
 She's here for the sword. 
 Get it out of here and to my house. 
 I don't need this. 
 Without EPIC, we are falling behind. 
 Although Molly's download was incomplete, the EPIC units are still useful. 
 Our operatives are using them now, and they've been distributed to law enforcement. 
 Great. 
 The technology I've spent a year and billions of dollars developing is only a partial success. 
 [sighs] We can just arrest them all for trespassing. 
 It'll be easy to isolate them with the EPIC. 
 No, these are our customers, and every single one of them has a cell phone with a camera. 
 We spoil their fun, it goes viral in an instant. 
 You do want the girl, though. 
 I do. 
 Send one of you to get them. Be discreet. 
 And take care of Molly Walker's body, please. 
 I've got the lab. This one will take the gate. 
 [gate buzzer sounds] 
 [all shouting] 
 It's okay. Let 'em through. 
 [all cheering] 
 Female voice: Remember, registration is the law. 
 Failure to comply with registration procedures will result in severe measures and penalties. 
 Help us keep everyone safe. It's our shared duty. 
 [female voice repeating instructions in Spanish] Wait. What is that? Tracking device with satellite uplink. Eye in the sky, so we always know where you are. It used to be the hand, but we put it here. [winces] Wouldn't want to nick an artery. You have an allowed radius. Breach it, an alarm's triggered. Response time is less than ten minutes. Who responds? You don't want to find out. [tires squealing] [engine revving] I think we need to give her a name. [siren wailing in the distance] Jose! [dramatic exotic music] What is this? [speaking Latin] This is Latin. It's genus species names. These are seeds. A seed bank-- a very, very large seed bank... the kind you build when you're planning to repopulate. "Repopulate"? After an extinction. Oh, man. You and Molly were right. I have no idea what my mother's up to. Let's speculate later. [door buzzer sounds] We need to vamoose before we're jacked into one of those crazy-ass pods. Come on. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 672, Renkert? That's it--672. They're loading them for transport. To where? That might be a good question for your mother, Taylor. Evil bitch. [chuckles] Evil bitch or not, you're about to mend fences with her. Joanne? Hello? [sighs] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [cell phone beeping] Caspar, it's Farah, again. We've been here for hours. Our contact hasn't shown up. Call me. [cell phone beeps] [glasses beeping, whirring] She's headed east. [glasses beeping, whirring] [click] You're the best daddy in the whole world. I love you, Daddy. Female voice: Remember, Registration is the law. So what are you running from, Tommy? Should I call you Kevin... or Michael... or Justin? Five aliases-- that's got to be a record for someone your age. So I'm gonna ask you again. What are you and your mother running from? You and people like you. People like me need laws to protect us from people like you. That's what the Odessa Protocol's all about. Wait. Is that what's gonna happen to me? Am I gonna disappear like the other-- What about my mom? I don't know what's gonna happen until we get a few things cleared, so why don't we start with you telling me your real name? It's Tommy. The others were fake. Your last name? Clark. Your real last name, the one you had before you were adopted. Unless you were adopted when you were an infant and you don't remember. No, I'm not adopted. Your blood type is AB, your mother's is O-negative, so, biologically speaking, there's no way that could happen... What about my father? No matter what blood type your father had. Anne Clark isn't your birth mother. So we need to find your birth parents, in case they're unregistered as well. Meantime, I am logging your abilities and your tracking number. You're required to report any changes in your teleportation power or if you develop any new abilities. [cell phone beeping] He's gone. Lock down the hospital. [cell phone beeps] Penny for your thoughts, Agent Cutler. What is it? What's wrong? We were supposed to meet someone, and I'm pretty sure I had a tail. I think you still do. What's happening? Who are they? Where is it? Where's the baby? I'm afraid your powers can't hide you anymore. The next one won't miss. Farah! [gunshot] Malina, chalo. Chalo! [siren wailing in the distance] I want to see Detective Dearing. Something he's investigating? No, something he committed. My nephew Jose-- he's 12 years old-- and Father Mauricio from Saint Francis, they're both missing. And they were at my family's auto shop. Dearing knows where they are. Kidnapping's a pretty serious charge. Yes, it is. So, like I said, if I could talk to him-- Wait right here. Guy out front here says you might know something about a kidnapping. A couple people disappeared from an auto shop on Las Flores. Really? Doesn't ring a bell. Have him take a seat. I'll be there in a minute. Hey, Dearing, check this out. These new EPIC things finally showed up. Do you really think these things can tell you if there's an Evo in the room? [glasses beeping, whirring] Where you going, boss? [glasses beeping, whirring] I left my phone in the car. Back off. We'll handle this. Get back to work. [grunting] You should have told us, man. You know what we have to do to you now. Let's get him up. Get up. [grunts] [device beeps] [indistinct chatter] [device beeps] Let's get ready. Erica. Great. We're almost ready for you. Thank you, Richard. Everything okay? Fine, yes. Family stuff. You have a daughter, don't you? I do, but she's six, so she thinks I'm a god. [chuckles] Maybe she's right. What you're doing is godlike-- the next Big Bang without the noise or the mess. Ready? All clear. [buzzer sounds] [machine whirring] Phenomenal. It is just phenomenal, Richard. We've built an entire company based on mining the power of Evos, but this... this one's power is by far the most important. [cell phone ringing] Excuse me. [cell phone beeps] Mom. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to go that far. I was just trying to get back at you because of Francis. I know it was childish of me. Yes, it was. Can we talk, please... face-to-face? Where are you, Taylor? At the house. I just really need to talk. I'll meet you there. [sniffles] I've always been an excellent fake crier. [sighs] [indistinct chatter] [glasses beeping, whirring] [glasses beeping] [glasses beeping] Hey, what the hell? We paid our rent. I don't rent to Evos. You can't just throw us out. You didn't register, and that's grounds for eviction. You've got 30 days to comply. I don't see them. Them who? Who were those people? Renautas. Who's that? A corporation hell-bent on making sure you don't complete your mission. A corporation? How did they find us? I don't know, but I think those glasses he was wearing can see our powers. Malina... you don't have to save the world alone, but if those men catch us... Come on. All right, so the trick here... [laughter] The trick here is that you don't want to use too much glue, all right, buddy? Now, we're just gonna use a little dab around the edges and on the bottom, just like so. Then you just-- [gasps] Exciting moment. Set it in. Voilà, nice and easy. Okay? Got it? - Yeah. I think he's got it, babe. He's got it. - Yay. All right, Captain, you want to see if she's seaworthy? Yeah. - One, two, three, let her rip. Yeah! Come on, buddy. We built that. Yeah. - We did that. [cell phone beeping] [line trilling] [line clicks] [sobs] Hey, Marcy, it's Luke. Um... [sniffles] I need to see Don right away. [line trilling] Damn it. Is anyone coming to meet us? Run. Chalo. Chalo! We can't keep running. I can stop them. 
 
 [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ It's not working! I can't use my powers. Get to the back. Get to the back! Aah! Oh, my God, no. [grunts] Oh! I can't. Go, just go. I'm not leaving you. When the time comes, you will know what to do. The answers you need are in this envelope. Run. Run! [groans] [dramatic music] [engine turning over] [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ Tommy! Oh, my gosh! You're okay. It's all gonna be okay. No, it's not gonna be okay. It's never going to be okay. It really doesn't matter. That's not the problem. What is it? She's not my mom. What? My mom-- she's not my mom! Our blood types don't match, and I didn't even know, and I've got all these different names, and I don't even know if mine is real. Lots of people are adopted. I mean, it's not okay that your mom didn't tell you. Being adopted isn't any big deal. People are test-tube babies and surrogate babies. She lied to me... about everything. I don't even know who I am. You've got to talk to her... give her a chance to explain. [engine turning over] [gasps] [computer beeping] [indistinct chatter over police radio] [engine turning over] [tires squealing] What the hell's going on? We got a problem down here. [tires screeching] [choking] What the hell are you doing here? You took my friends. I can leave you here and let your men tear you apart, or... you take me where they are. Okay, okay. Yeah. Really? Really. [engine turning over] [tires squealing] [gunshots] [alarm system beeps] Sorry I interrupted your day. It seems that you are always sorry for something. Tell me why you went behind my back. I just wanted answers. But you didn't trust me to give them to you? It's not about trust. It's just, whenever I ask you a question, all I wind up with is more questions. This whole thing is about your friend Francis? We were more than friends, and I asked you if you killed him. Which was utterly ridiculous. Maybe, but you didn't tell me what you did do with him. You didn't tell me he was locked in the basement, wired up in some kind of pod, along with all those other Evos. Francis knew exactly what he was getting into when he came to work for Renautas. He believes in what we're doing. What exactly is that, Mother? Saving the future that we've squandered, and that requires sacrifice. Molly Walker-- did she understand about sacrifice too? Is that why she blew her brains out? I cannot talk to you when you are like this. You are being delusional and paranoid. It's happening again, isn't it? You're using. I'm not using. Don't try to blame this on me. We have been down this road, Taylor. I know the signs. Mom, I'm not using! That's exactly what a junkie would say. I'm sorry, but I don't believe you. I do. Long time, Erica. So dramatic, Noah. You could have just knocked. And you... you broke my heart. I'm not so sure you have one anymore. Where's my sister? I have no idea what you're talking about. "I have no idea what you're talking about." Okay, all right. Why don't you two give me a minute with her? Come on, Erica, let's take a walk. It's hard to believe it's only been a year since we've worked together. When Renautas took over Primatech, I considered you one of my greatest assets. Who could have imagined this scenario? What is on your mind, Noah? Did you kill my daughter? I had nothing to do with Claire's death. And Hiro Nakamura? He died at the Summit with all the rest. You can blame Mohinder Suresh for that. And Molly Walker. You gonna stand there and claim that her blood is not on your hands? Molly Walker was part of something larger than herself. She just couldn't get past her own selfishness and fear. What is so big and so important that it is worth Molly's life and the lives of all those other people you have locked up in that basement? Us, Noah. This planet. There is no cost too high. Including murder? That's what's wrong with you. You grew soft, and like most of humanity, you are not willing to do what's necessary, but I am. I am giving us a future. Somebody has to. How exactly does this work, this big sacrifice of yours? Why should I tell you? You're the one who chose to forget... who chose to wipe his own memory, all to protect-- W-what? To protect what? [chuckles] You mean "who," don't you? I'm tired of this game. I want answers! You can put the gun down now. Thank you, Harris. Your errand was certainly timely. His friends are in the kitchen. Not a problem. I brought company. [doorbell rings] Luke. Marcy told me it was an emergency. I came as soon as I could. Uh, come in. Can I get you a drink or something? N-no. No, I'm--I'm fine. Why am I here, Luke? I got patients waiting. How much will you pay me for my share of the practice, Don? Don't think about it. Just tell me. Look, I'm gonna head back to the office, all right? We can talk about this in the morning. Do you want the practice? If you asked me a year ago-- Do you want the practice, Don? Yeah. That's great. [inhales deeply] Just, uh-- just write me a check. You making a change... or just retiring? Atoning. Richard called. He says it's important. Please. Everything is important to Richard-- how many loads we can transfer per day, how he takes his coffee. Fine. What is it this time? I don't know. We'll go see him when we're done here. You're not getting away with this. Everybody's gonna know-- What would you like to do with them? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Give me the sword, now. You got this? Yeah. ♪ ♪ [door slides closed] Arigato. Yes! Tommy. [sighs] Thank God you're all right. What did they do to you? What did you tell them? What did I tell them? I don't know, Mom. What could I tell them? Not the truth, 'cause I don't know the truth, do I? You lied to me. You've always lied to me. Nathan-- Nathan? Is that even my name, who I am? Where did I come from? You are my son. No matter what name we are using, you have always been my son. I wanted to tell you. I did... but there just never seemed to be a good time. But I will tell you everything. Everything, Anne? You really ready to tell him everything? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I lost them. There must be a secret exit, like a tunnel or something. Where is my sister-- Phoebe Frady? Oh, easy, easy. That's enough. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, man? We got him right where we want him. We could beat the answers out of him if we want to, but now you want to wuss out on me? [gun cocks] Where is my sister? Quentin, that's enough. You know him and you didn't tell me? Of course your mother knows me. I've been around for a while. How long? Over a year now. A year? W-wait. Are you my dad? No. He's not your dad. Then why have you been following me f-for a year? [sighs] Because you're that important, Tommy, very important. I couldn't tell you. I had to take you away before you found out, 'cause I was afraid that when you found out, you-- you would try to save your dad. I couldn't lose you both. You shouldn't have run. Then this wouldn't have happened. What do you want with me? Why am I so important? You have a destiny. Humanity has one last hope for survival, and part of it rests on your shoulders. What does that even mean? [sighs] You're going to help save the world. No... I'm not. [sobs] [smoke alarm beeping] [alarm blaring] [alarm continues blaring] [engine rumbling] Erica, thank God. Are you okay? Of course. Just a minor inconvenience. I'm afraid Mr. Harris here underestimated the situation, but I'm sure he won't do it again. Right. Well, the reason I called-- things are happening much more quickly than we anticipated. How quickly? Less than a week. Have you run the simulation? Yes, that's what I needed you to see. With the magnetic poles reversing, we are going to be defenseless against solar radiation. A coronal mass ejection unlike anything the world has ever seen is headed our way. We're talking total devastation-- 96% of all species on Earth wiped out in a matter of days. It's worse than we ever expected. What did you expect, Richard? Starting over is never pretty.
