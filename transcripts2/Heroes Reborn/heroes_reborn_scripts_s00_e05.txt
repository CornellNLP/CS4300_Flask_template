 You know when I was a kid, and I I always felt different, special. 
 Phoebe! 
 How are you...? 
 My sister is an EVO. How cool is that? 
 That's amazing! 
 I'm trying to protect you! 
 I don't need your help! 
 This act of terrorism is a threat to mankind, to our humanity. 
 After a unanimous vote, Congress is set to ratify the Odessa Protocol. 
 We let fear overcome commonsense. Passed legislation that violates privacy... 
 She used to cover all my boxes in my car. 
 You going to help me or what? 
 Come on. 
 You can't keep doing this to yourself. How many times are you going to watch these? 
 There's gotta be something in here. 
 Something I missed. 
 Even if there was, Quentin, what you are you going to do with it? 
 I'll report it to Hero Truther. 
 Great! So you and the ten other shut-ins that scoured the site will see it. 
 Maybe it's time to let her go. 
 You think she did it, don't you? 
 I... I don't know. 
 Hey, but I heard her screaming every night for a year. Something was wrong and you now that. 
 She was lost and scared... you know, maybe Suresh got in her head... 
 Suresh had nothing to do with it. 
 She never met Suresh. 
 I have his unpublished book right here... 
 Hero Truther uploaded it. 
 It's all here. I read all of it. 
 All right, he was not a radical. 
 He was a humanist. 
 They only believed that EVOs were natures way of... of safeguarding mankind. 
 So why would you destroy our only hope? 
 They made him the fall guy. 
 Who is they? 
 Renautas! 
 Check it out. 
 A-right... 
 June 13th was a calculated event to vilify EVOs. 
 Renautas, brought Phoebe to Odessa for some kind of reason and Primatech, well... Pri... Renautas and Primatech are connected... I just don't know how... 
 Quentin! Quentin, look at yourself! 
 This isn't healthy. 
 Okay? None of this is gonna bring her back. 
 Look, whatever happened, okay, whether she did it or not, Phoebe is gone. 
 Okay? And we need to move on with our lives. 
 Guess that must be really easy for you, huh? 
 Um... 
 Okay, screw you Quentin! 
 They claim that my sister was one of the Odessa attackers, and she murdered thousands! 
 But as you can see, from these videos I posted, that that is not true. 
 She was innocent! 
 Hero Truther, I need you to help me find some proof. 
 I couldn't save Phoebe. 
 But I can clear her name. 
 You know, find out who took her away from me. 
 Whoa, whoa! 
 I'm sorry about your sister. 
 I've lost more loved ones than I care to count. 
 We were at war, and taking on Renautas is a battle we are going to lose. 
 I'm sorry, I can't afford the risk. 
 So what? So what? We're supposed to give up? 
 We're supposed to throw the towel? 
 What happened, man? 
 You were supposed to be exposing the truth. 
 Odessa changed everything. 
 The public's scared. They'd rather hunt us down, pick us off one by one, than hear the truth. 
 My sister followed your example. 
 Claire Bennett's. 
 She stood up and she declared herself. 
 She believed in you. 
 She trusted you. 
 She wanted to be a hero. 
 But it got her killed. 
 Don't you let her death be in vain. 
 You owe her. 
 We can get you inside. 
 But after that, it'll be up to you. 
 Let's do it. 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
 
 
 
 Hello, Mr. Fitzgerald. 
 You look really good. ah, we've got this... and then I got... a pen. 
 Anything in this? 
 It's a camera? 
 Oh, no way. 
 That's awesome! 
 Yes! 
 It's like I'm James Bond. 
 But where... are the Bond women? 
 It would be a dream come true to work for a venerable company such as Renautas. 
 And did you know... did you know that doing good is also my business? 
 It's pretty amazing. Wait... are you kidding? 
 Of course I will start today. 
 I can't wait to expose you for what evil bastards you truly are. 
 Orientation tour begins in five minutes. 
 Please proceed to the south entry. 
 So here at Renautas we want to foster your creative spirit. 
 Doing good is good business, and we know that happy employees do the best work. 
 So we have catered lunch from noon to 2pm each day, Taco Tuesdays, and a sushi chef on Wednesday. 
 We always encourage midday recreation to stimulate your creativity. 
 So we have foosball, table tennis and dodgeball in the summer. 
 We also have brainstorming sessions frequently, that occur outside. 
 Sunshine time is a really great and healthy way to get your daily dose of... and can instruct you in entire Absolute Yoga or even take a nap... 
 I'm in. 
 Entry level, but, uh, I can work my way up. Any access that we need. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Uh, thank you so much for taking my call. 
 Yeah, it's... 
 Come in, come in. Good. Ah... 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 I just wanted to say that I am sorry, for what I said. 
 Um, me too. 
 You know you... you look really good though. You look better... 
 Thank you. 
 ... than... 
 I did. Yeah, I was getting... 
 Yeah. 
 I was getting rough. 
 Ah, you were right. 
 You know, it's time for me to get off my ass, take some initiative. and do something, you know, so, I... 
 Totally. got a job. 
 Oh. 
 That's great. Where are you working? 
 Here. 
 Check this out. 
 Renautas? 
 Oh my God. 
 I'm working with Hero Truther. 
 He's covering my tracks. 
 I can just bide my time, I'm collecting ammunition, to take them down. 
 If they caught you... 
 Everybody thinks that Primatech burned down on June 13th, but they are wrong. Not only is there a connection between Renautas and Primatech, but get this: bum-dum-dah-dah, Renautas is Primatech. 
 Is that nuts? 
 That's great! And it's all here. 
 All of it. 
 All I see, is someone sitting alone in the dark, ranting like a crazy person. 
 No, you don't... I could... 
 No, when you called me, I was really hoping you had to sh1t together, but you don't! 
 I have my sh1t together! 
 Okay, this is too much, Quentin. 
 Look. 
 You can help us expose them. 
 I... I don't want... anything to do with this. 
 Okay? Don't call me again. 
 Here. Look at this. 
 They got a whole team digitizing Primatech assets. 
 This is the hard evidence that proves that Renautas is keeping up the same practices as the company. 
 If there's gonna be a smoke and gun, it's gotta be in there! 
 I can't bypass their firewalls without leaving myself vulnerable to an attack. 
 You'll have to copy the files locally. 
 So break into Renautas? 
 And hack into the systems? 
 Like... there? 
 Okay. 
 Where is it? 
 Where is it? 
 Username. 
 Password. Okay. 
 Dit, dit, dit, dit, der... 
 Primatech. 
 Ah, Noah Bennett... 
 Walker System. 
 Go, go, go! sh1t! 
 Ever met an EVO with pyrokinesis? 
 No. 
 Don't tempt me or I will light your ass up, man. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Please, I've got a wife and kids. 
 Just start counting to 100. 
 You don't open your eyes until you're done. 
 One. 
 Two. 
 Three. 
 Louder! 
 Four. 
 I can't hear you! 
 Five. 
 Louder! 
 Six. 
 Seven. 
 I can't believe that worked! 
 Yes! Yes!
