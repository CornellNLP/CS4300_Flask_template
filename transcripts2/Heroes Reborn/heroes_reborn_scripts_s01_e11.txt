 Previously, on "Heroes Reborn"... 
 The planet is changing, no matter how we deny it. 
 Do they have any idea what's really coming? 
 So the question arises: How do we ensure our survival in the dark days? 
 You're not alone, Malina. 
 You'll have help. 
 Why are we rounding up Evos? 
 To save our species. 
 The world as we know it is ending. 
 I know, you believe in your grandmother's visions, but you and your sister can't stop this. 
 Lately I have been plagued with dreams. 
 Fire raining down, blood everywhere, and the twins, saving the world under a clock tower in Odessa. 
 How much longer do we have? 
 When the magnetic poles shift, animal migration patterns will be disrupted. 
 Birds, butterflies, all flying in the wrong direction. 
 And eventually the northern lights will appear further south than ever before. 
 Meet mankind's greatest hope. 
 Right now I have to get you and your sister to Odessa. 
 Destiny, while marching ever in our direction, can be rerouted by the choices we make. 
 The fate of the entire world depends on us getting this right tonight. 
 What if I don't have the strength? 
 Then I suggest you find it, or that brother that's been looking for you, when the world ends, he's gonna burn right along with it. 
 You used my sister's shadow to dampen everyone at the summit's powers, then you blew them all up. 
 [All yelling and grunting] 
 Who will live? 
 Who will die? 
 And who among us will inherit this brave new world? 
 Come on! 
 Something big's coming. Something big's coming! 
 We're receiving more reports of severe and unpredictable weather in the Midwest. 
 The Southern Illinois city of Carbondale is being hammered by a powerful electrical storm. 
 Fires have broken out in several parts of the city. 
 The Illinois-- [Radio silences] 
 [Dark music] 
 My grandfather would never leave me. 
 He promised we would do this together. 
 How could he have just disappeared? 
 If that car hit him, where's his body? 
 Malina, we can try and find him. 
 I can circle back. We can see if there's-- 
 There's too much at stake. 
 He wouldn't have wanted me go backwards. 
 I bet that woman who was hunting me, Erica Kravid, took him. 
 I know she took Tommy. 
 My brother and I need to be in Odessa. 
 Whatever you have to do, whatever it takes, I'm gonna be right there with you, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 So what's our time frame? 
 How long before this thing hits? 
 Two days. 
 Oh, two days, plenty of time. 
 Okay, Tommy's been taken to Midian, Colorado, which means that's our first stop, and then we get you two to Odessa. 
 What? Piece of cake. 
 All right, here we go. 
 [Indistinct P.A. announcement] 
 You shoot fireballs out of your hands. 
 Why do you need a gun and bullets? 
 Well, because my powers are unreliable without the sun, so if we have to fight at night, we're going to need insurance, right? 
 We are in Missouri, after all. 
 I can get you your own gun if you want one. 
 Mm, no need. I have a 24-hour power. 
 I want to get this. 
 It kind of reminds me of Farah. 
 Okay. 
 Shoppers, attention please. 
 We are sold out of bottled water and survival food packs. 
 Oh, man. 
 All these people, loading up on supplies for the storm of the century. 
 They have no idea what's really happening. 
 We do have water containers on our back aisle. 
 Limit one per customer, please. 
 This was in Bedford, Missouri, a few hours ago. 
 Whoa. 
 They think that Bennet's grandson is in Midian. 
 That's where they're headed. 
 Weather has closed portions of the freeway that gets them there. 
 If we can get here before they do, we can intercept them. 
 Can't wait to kill that little bitch. 
 Bennet knows we'll be coming after them. 
 We'll have to surprise them. 
 Maybe we could take the girl alive, bring her back to Renautas. 
 She could be super valuable alive. 
 Erica made her wishes clear as crystal: Terminate with extreme prejudice. 
 I'm not really clear on how you can terminate someone with mild prejudice, but I guess that's not the point. 
 Then what is the point, Quentin? 
 She's not that much younger than you. 
 This doesn't bother you at all? 
 Not even a little. 
 [Whispering] It bothers me. 
 Are we going to have a problem? 
 Are we, Q? 
 No, we're good. 
 Who are you? Why did you try and rescue me? 
 It is my mission, to free the master of time and space. 
 How did you even get here? 
 I don't know. 
 Who sent you on this mission? 
 My father, Hachiro Otomo. 
 Wait. 
 Why are you looking at me like that? 
 9th Wonders. You're-- you're Katana Girl! Look. 
 What? 
 How is this possible? 
 My mom said that these comic books foretold my father's future. 
 Mine too, I guess. 
 Why am I in it? 
 You're connected to us. 
 You must play a part in saving the world. 
 What's happening to you? 
 I'm not...real. 
 You're not real?

 ♪ ♪ 
 Has the Eternal Fortress been rebuilt? 
 Almost. I just need a little more time. 
 There's not much left, Hachiro. 
 I realize that. 
 Do you? 
 Because your your digital spawn freed Hiro Nakamura and destroyed the fortress, and somehow ended up here, I have had to rely on my powers of persuasion to keep that teenage teleporter on a very tenuous leash. 
 And once again, Katana Girl has managed to get in the way. 
 That's the thing about constructs. 
 They are single-minded. 
 The only thing keeping you alive right now is the fact that you're the only one capable of fixing the problem you created.

 Today, nobody is in charge of your happiness but you. 
 How many are out there? 
 I don't know. Hundreds. 
 What the hell is happening? 
 My mother's sick plan. Bagging and tagging Evos. 
 Downloading their powers into tech. 
 It's more than that. 
 She's prepping for Armageddon. 
 The earth is going to burn. 
 That job I took the last time I saw you? 
 It was to keep a girl hidden from Renautas. 
 Her name is Malina. 
 She and her brother are Evos who can stop the hele. 
 Then we need to find these two. 
 Now how do we start? 
 There's someone here who can help our cause.
