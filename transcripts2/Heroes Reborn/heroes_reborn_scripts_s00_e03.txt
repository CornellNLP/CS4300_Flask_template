 How long before voluntary registration becomes mandatory? 
 Around the country, schools and workplaces have started to require genetic testing. This is nothing more than a blatant excuse for discrimination. 
 Every concession we make is another signature on our death warrant. 
 Join the fight. 
 Start the revolution. 
 This is not bad. 
 I'm so happy this worked out. 
 So many cute guys showed up. 
 You would notice that! 
 Whoa, what is all this? 
 Oh, finally! What took you so long. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. I just thought this was gonna be like a few people. This is crazy. 
 Yeah, well, we tweeted out, and everyone started showing up, it's great. 
 Yeah, now it's like a full-on protest. 
 I thought we talked about taking this easy, Phoebe. This is kinda crazy. 
 The school is trying to deny EVO's scholarships, okay? 
 That's total bullshit. 
 Yeah, and genetics should have nothing to do with education. 
 Exactly, thank you. 
 Who are those guys? 
 This might be time to get out of here. 
 Get that sign out of my face, asshole. 
 Let's go! Let's get out of here. 
 No, we have to take a stand. 
 Look what this freak did! 
 Get 'em all, come on. Let's go! 
 This wasn't supposed to happen! 
 Let's go please. 
 Everyone stop! 
 How did you do that? 
 I... I... 
 Okay, she's one of them too. 
 I don't know... 
 Let's get the hell out of here. Come on! 
 No, no, no, no, no. Do not arrest her. She was trying to stop it. 
 She was just trying to help. 
 Turn the camera off! 
 I am documenting this. 
 Registration is for your own safety. 
 Use of abilities is a criminal offense. 
 When did you first became aware of your abilities? 
 16. 
 Who do you live with when you're not at school? 
 My brother, um... my half-brother... 
 Mother deceased. 
 What about your father? Where is he? 
 I don't know. 
 Why do you need to know all this? 
 All evolved humans must be entered in the database. 
 It's a new federal mandate. 
 Stand on the line. 
 Eyes right here. 
 Here she comes. 
 What an effin' nightmare. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So check it out. I am officially an evolved human. 
 It's not funny. 
 Did you hear her in there? 
 National registration? 
 You're lucky all you got was an ID card! 
 I know. 
 Did you not see the latest Hero Truther video? 
 I mean, come on! Look... 
 Jesus Christ! and military conscription in China. 
 In Russia. 
 They got people going to frigging camps, and they're getting sterilized! 
 Oh sure, but that's Russia and China. 
 It could be here in a second! 
 I told you about Coyote Sands! 
 All right? The government has known about EVOs since way before Claire Bennett came out... 
 Weren't you the one who wanted me to make videos in the first place. 
 I didn't know you were gonna go round organizing protests. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. 
 You gotta be more careful. 
 Can we just go? 
 Internship fetes, internship fair. 
 I'm hiring interns, also known as, a girlfriend. 
 So can a cab. 
 Just going to take some of these... 
 Phoebe's gonna love all my B-roll. 
 Uh, that's really weird. 
 We take about six applicants a semester. 
 Great. 
 Do you have any ID? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Just give me one minute. 
 Globus Bio Solutions. 
 Yeah, I was on their website, and they do some really cool stuff with cell biology. 
 "Some really cool stuff, I'm so excited." 
 Sorry, the position has been filled. 
 That's blatant discrimination, you know that, right? 
 Stop. Quentin. 
 Do you know that? 
 Quentin. Quentin, I have you... I have you on camera. it doesn't matter. It's fine, come on. 
 I don't work with those assholes anyway. 
 I got all that on tape. 
 Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear what happened, uh... 
 Perhaps I can interest you in a different point of view. 
 Evolved if you will. 
 Renautas? 
 We're one of the fastest growing tech companies in the nation, but we don't discriminate. 
 In fact, we encourage the highly evolved humans at our newest campus. 
 The future holds many exciting opportunities, and Renautas believes you are meant to do something extraordinary. 
 Um... thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 Good thing that wasn't creepy. 
 I don't know. I mean, it sounds kinda cool. 
 You just like him 'cause he looks like Blade. 
 Yes, that is it. 
 Doing good is good business. 
 True. 
 Quentin's Cooking Show, episode 1. 
 Oh, we're shooting this? All right. 
 Yes, yeah. 
 Everything. We're documenting this meal. Wow! 
 So first thing you want is some... is some fungi. 
 Oh right... so, no Right here. Yeah. meal is complete without some fungus. 
 Yeah, absolutely, 'cause it gives it that like, dirt taste. 
 Mm, yum! My fav. 
 Like an old woman made the sauce. 
 Mincing... give it a bit of a mince... 
 That is quite the technique. I'm not gonna get that. 
 I think I'm probably just gonna use the telephone and... order food. 
 You ready? You ready? We're gonna do this Oh my God, yes! Okay, yeah... on three... One, two, three! 
 Ah! Okay... three Grrrr! 
 Ah! 
 That's the most traumatic things I've ever done. 
 Yeah, um... 
 So, if I don't... get an internship this summer... I think I wanna go to the Odessa Summit. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Come on! 
 This is our chance to show the world that we're not freaks. We deserve rights. 
 It's our chance to prove that we're meant to do something extraordinary. 
 That we're meant to usher in the future. 
 I think that you should stay here. 
 Focus on your finals. 
 Of course... course you do. 
 We're you the one who said I have to reach out and be part of a movement? 
 Th... you filmed the whole thing, and now you don't want to be there when history is made? 
 I think it's a bad idea. 
 Okay. Especially after what just happened at the rally. 
 This is such bullshit! 
 Come on... 
 I'm trying to protect you. 
 I don't need your help! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Not cool!
