 Previously on "Heroes Reborn"... 
 This is the first city of the future, Tommy. 
 I call it Gateway. 
 Hiro Nakamura created a time bridge between the present and the future. If you don't reopen the bridge, our species goes extinct. Welcome aboard. The machine will amplify your power, allowing you to send anyone who's wearing one of these to the future in an instant. [electronic whirring] You have been fed a pack of lies by the head of Renautas, Erica Kravid. Either your mother lives up to her promises, or you're gonna die here just like everybody else. Your next target. She has a new protector. My brother and I need to be in Odessa. Whatever you have to do, whatever it takes,  I'm gonna be right there with you, okay? [grunts] Whoa! Drop the gun. ♪ ♪ [exotic vocalizing] ♪ ♪ What we're talking about here is a super flare, a coronal mass ejection.. [man speaking foreign language] A burst of energy from the sun... People are urged to take shelter and stay indoors at all times. Thousands are evacuating, Doctor. Air traffic has been grounded. People are panicking, not just because of the extreme weather conditions, but because of this terrorist video. But you're telling me this video isn't just alarmist propaganda. No, it's definitely not just propaganda. The world is facing something unprecedented, something violent and catastrophic. And yet, why wasn't this made public? I can't answer that. This information is just now coming to light. What about the accusation that Evos are to blame? Hero Truther has released information that vindicates Evos and implicates Renautas. HeroTruther? They have no credibility. We have to face reality. The first of two enormous solar flares will hit North America tomorrow at the exact moment the powerful magnetic force of our poles reverse. Which means? Billions of people will perish. Billions? - If not all of us. And these solar storms will impact us between 12 and 15 hours from now, starting as a series of electromagnetic disruptios and building to something far more sinister once the full brunt of the storm hits. So what should people do to protect themselves, to survive? Get to the nearest government evacuation shelter... and pray. Tommy! [panting] Tommy. You saw the video. You can't tell me you still trust her. The H.E.L.E. is coming, no matter what they say about Erica on TV. Well, then we need to be looking for your sister. Where? I don't even really know her. We have to save as many people as possible before this thing hits. Wait. Where's your Gateway watch? I haven't gotten it yet. Emily, you have to. Please. Just in case, okay? See you soon. Tommy... Tommy! Ma'am, this is a restricted area. [breathing heavily] Good evening, Tommy. You saw the broadcast. Was it true? Does it matter? Let's just get this over with. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [beeps] Greetings, Tommy. Please place your other had in the connection harnes. Power core active. Quantum sync engaged. Advanced Team D, prepare for transfer.

Temporal energy at 50%. Monitor him closely. Gateway system is online. ♪ ♪ [machine whirs] Gateway portal is stable. Transfer sequence commencing. [watch chimes] Gateway portal opened. Gateway transfer in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [electronic zap] Transfer complete. All clear. Thank you, Tommy. [machine powers down] Advanced team transfer... Just need to keep him under control for 14 more hours. Quantum sync disengage. Running system check. Ms. Kravid, you're needed upstairs. I'll be right there. Keep him focused. Light a fire under Hachiro Otomo. I brought him back from the future for one reason, to fix "Evernow." Gateway diagnostics normal. Ready for Advanced Team . [exotic vocalizing] ♪ ♪ Welcome, Gateway pioneer. Please proceed to the nearest gate station. The next available representative will verify your credentials and begin the registration process. [woman speaking foreign language] [device beeps] Excuse me. What--where? Sir, over here, please. What's your name? Uh, Ren Shimosawa. ♪ ♪ [beeping] [beeps] Thank you, Mr. Shimosawa. You'll need to register in order to get your watch. [electronic zap] [yelps] That's your ID chip. Welcome to Gateway. ♪ ♪ You're listening to KXKB News Radio, with the most current updates on the geomagnetic solar storm terrifying the nation. Texas governor has declared a state of emergency. Area residents are being evacuated to Union Wells high school. Residents are... That's where Claire Bennet went. If there's an evacuation, why are they stopping people? Must be looking for something... or someone. [laughs] Public enemy number one. You are never getting into Gateway. Exercise extreme caution while driving. Magnetic anomalies... Maybe instead of finding Tommy, we get his attention. Have him find us. Hybrid and electric car batteries... Okay. But how? ♪ ♪ We make a little news. First we get rid of our excess baggage. [scoffs] Stay tuned for more updates as we receive them. I realize that deploying the National Guard around Gateway is no small favor. Governor, I have neither the time nor the patience to explain myself to somebody who's still so concerned with public opinion. So hang up your phone, strap on your watch, and let me save the world. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [door bangs] [whimpering] Hello, Erica. Did you miss me? How can I help you, Matthew? Get over there. You made some promises concerning my family's future, but instead, you treated my family like they're expendable, used them as leverage. Well, you know what? I can do the same to yours. Matt, wait. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [laughs] How's that feel, Erica? Huh? How's that feel, Erica? ♪ ♪ [dramatic exotic music] [gasping] Mom. Shall we talk about family now, Erica? Taylor has nothing to do with this. Oh, really? While I was doing your bidding, jumping at your every move, you were holding my family over my head. I want three one-way tickets to your utopian future. My wife, my son, and me. That was our deal. Our deal was based on you fulfilling certain obligations. I lived up to my end of the bargain. I ravaged every mind that you sent me. Sunstone ended in disaster. Mom, give him what he wants. You hear that? I mean, it would be such a shame for you to lose your daughter... And your grandchild. ♪ ♪ Oops. [laughs quietly] Taylor didn't mention that yet, huh? [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Travel safely. Adios. Oh, and you can drop the gun now. [gasping, sobbing] With less than ten hours until the solar flare hits, we're already feeling its effects: power outages in Abilene, a dangerous cloud... Stay here. Are being reported near Midland. [door-ajar signal chimes] Get out, now. You're not that guy anymore. Malina, wait in the car. Move, now. Go. ♪ ♪ [electronic warbling] Gateway transfer complete. Thank you, Tommy. Advanced Team Q transfer complete. You're telling me this is the best that you can do? We've had a week. It's just not good enough. I'm sorry. It'll have to work. We're really cutting it close with these numbers. Things moved more quickly than we anticipated. As long as we get 12,000 people to the other side. Anything less, we won't have enough genetic diversity to guarantee a healthy population. We're supposed to save as many people as we can. What are you talking about? What's gonna happen to everyone else? You son of a... [exotic vocalizing] ♪ ♪ Let me guess. Francis? [sniffs] How does it feel? Knowing your grandchild's father is one of them? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Not as unfamiliar as you'd think. [coughing] [rasping] [breathing heavily] [somber music] ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, Erica. I gave him something for his pain, but there's not much more I can do for your father, medically speaking. [insect buzzing] I have certain abilities... beyond medicinal. [mystical chiming] [buzzes] ♪ ♪ [gasping] What? I can cure your daddy, Erica. ♪ ♪ But you must promise to keep it a secret just between us. ♪ ♪ Okay. Hmm. [shaky breathing] [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ [whispering] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shh... ♪ ♪ [knocking at door] Yes. [door latch clicks] The boy's gone. He got spooked and vanished. [huffs] Find his mother, and you'll find him. She's the only one he trusts. I'll be right down. Taylor, we need to table this. What are you doing? No. No. No. You know. No. No. You're not walking away from me. Taylor, not now. Not this time. Stop! [glass shattering] ♪ ♪ [exhales sharply] [chuckles] I'm an Evo. Don't be ridiculous. I've had you tested. That power doesn't come from you. Guess the baby takes after its father. I want to see Francis. Now is not a good time. It's never been a good time, Mother. I've spent an entire life on your back burner. Well, not anymore. We're not going to Primatech, are we? I'd be impressed if I actually thought you'd use that gun on us. Well, obviously you don't know me too well, now, do you? I don't think it's a good idea to provoke him right now. He had a chance to kill us, and he didn't take it. There's no way he's pulling that trigger now. Right, Luke? Stop. Just stop it. God, you are never gonna get it, are you? Luke, don't do it! [both grunting] Damn it. [intense music] ♪ ♪ [panting, groaning] [screams] ♪ ♪ Ah! Luke! ♪ ♪ [exotic vocalizing] ♪ ♪ [safety clicks] ♪ ♪ If you do this, you're with us till the end. There's no going back to your sister. That's not my sister. Welcome Gateway pioneers. Please proceed to check-in where a team leader will complete your registration process. You'll receive an orientation packet and smart watch, which will give you access to your designated housing assignment. May I help you? [scanner beeps] Ah. It'll just be a minute, Mr. Shimosawa. [indistinct chatter] Hello. Are you okay? I'm fine. You don't look fine. I think someone I care about is about to make a terrible mistake. Emily Duval? Your watch. Thanks. What kind of mistake? He trusts her. Ooh, Erica Kravid? This might sound crazy, but I am looking for the master of time and space to help me find my friend in the future. Master of time and space? Yes. Do you know him? Dude, I'm dating him. [sighing] Let's go find him. 
 
 [percussive music] ♪ ♪ Mom? [rattling, silence] [footsteps] [mystical shriek] [gasps] Tommy! I was wondering when you were gonna figure that out again. It's been one hell of a week. Please tell me you're not helping Erica. You cannot trust her. I know. She has lied to me about so many things. But not everything. You've got to see this to believe it. [exhales sharply] Where are we? You mean when. This is-- The future. No matter how many times I come here, it always looks like this, which means the prophecy was wrong. We don't stop the H.E.L.E. This is only one timeline. Your father said there are many possible futures. What if they're all wrong? Look, if I do what Erica wants, I can save this many people. I know that. No matter what, humanity survives. Your great grandmother had a vision. This time her vision was wrong. Tommy, you have trained most of your life for this. What good does that do me if I don't remember any of it? Whether you remember this or not, your father used to say that he was amazed by your abilities. He said you were capable of far more than he ever said. What does that even mean? More? I don't know. But when the time comes, you'll know what to do. Have faith in yourself. I have faith in you. ♪ ♪ And so did your father. ♪ ♪ [exotic vocalizing] ♪ ♪ This is the place that Malina and I are supposed to meet. Come on. You'll be safe here if you stay out of sight. [thunder crashes] All right, keep going up. I got to go find her. Where are you gonna look? The last place anyone saw her. Tommy, I love you. I love you too. [exotic vocalizing] ♪ ♪ Your big plan to rid the world of Evos. Now your grandchild is everything that you hate. How does that feel? Maybe you're beyond caring. You have no idea. No idea what I have sacrificed to raise you, to provide you with a life that I could only have dreamt about. By ruining the lives of so many others. For you, Taylor. I did it all for you. This has never been about me. It's always been about your ego, your obsessive need for control. You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm just a monster who's never thought about anybody but herself. [retching] Erica? You all right? Yeah. Yeah. [sighs heavily] You tell the father yet? No. No. I'm not sure I'm gonna. It's not like he's a good guy or anything. You weren't... He didn't... No, no, no. Nothing like that, Daddy. [toilet flushes] You decide what you're gonna do? I just want you to know that the decision... whatever you decide... I've got your back, okay? Enough stalling. I want to see Francis. Now. [suspenseful music] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [gasping] You. Francis is dead, isn't he? He's been dead this whole time. Why do you hate me so much? Taylor, please. Is it something I did? Was I that much of a disappointment to you? Answer me! Tell me the truth for once. I was so worried. I didn't know who else to call. [inhales sharply] Please, Doctor. [coughing] [rasping] She's been coughing up blood. Hmm, likely lung disease from all the coal dust in the air. Her condition looks to be fairly advanced. Please. Tell me you can help her. I can. [sighs] [coughing] [rasping] [mystical chiming] [gasps] [giggling] Mommy? Honey. Hey. That girl looks an awful lot like me. Her abilities could manifest when she gets older. Could be healer like me, could be something more, something different, something interesting and wonderful. She'll live with me. That'll be the better thing. What are you talking about? You don't have a choice. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Go. Go, now. You are and always have been the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. That's the truth. [shaky breathing] So what happens now? We start again. You and me... and the world. Perfect future. It's only possible if billions of people die. Life is full of impossible choices. I've made mine. I am prepared to live with them. It's time for you to make yours. Come with me. You and your baby. My grandchild. Let's start over again together. Thank you, Mother. As usual, you're being very generous, but I'd rather die than go on living in an empty world with you. [sobbing] [indistinct chatter] [soft, mysterious music] ♪ ♪ Hey. What is it? My mom. She looks so young. [exotic vocalizing] So this is the infamous cheerleader, huh? Come on. Let's go find your brother. I owe him an apology. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] Animals should be transported in and remain housed in.. [man speaking indistinctly] Veterinary care needed by individual animals will have to be provided by the pet's owner. [man speaking indistinctly] All right, Malina, take off your hood. Someone might recognize me. Exactly. You're gonna get her killed. Says the guy who tried to kill her yesterday. Look, I told you, we need to get Tommy's attention, and the best way to do that is with that news crew right there. What if Erica Kravid sees it too? She probably will. But fortunately, Tommy will get here faster, right? Come on. You need to do it in front of something recognizable like that sign, so just get in the middle of the circle there. You got this. [indistinct chatter] It's okay. Do your thing. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [crowd murmuring excitedly] [crowd shouting] This looks amazing! Evacuations are underway in 11 states across the southern part of the country, from Arizona to Louisiana. Anti-Evo sentiment has continued to grow with many blaming evolved humans for the impending disaster. The situation has come to a head in one particular event.. Hello? In Odessa, Texas, with a young girl at the center... Tommy, I know you're out there and I really hope you get this message. What? Oh, my God, it's her. Malina. The same place she went to school. Please, Tommy, hurry. Her brother has to see this. It's our only hope. Okay, I can restore the transmission, send it out on a loop to anything that receives a signal. [electronic zapping] Tommy, I know you're out there, and I really hope you get this message. I'm at Union Wells High School in Odessa, Texas, the same place she went to school. Please, Tommy, hurry. [exotic vocalizing] What happened? I went to Missouri, to the place where Malina saved all those people, looking for clues like an idiot. You're not an idiot, Tommy. I need to go back in time. Find Malina when she was actually there. No, your dad was very clear. Tampering with time is a very dangerous game. No, I don't care. It's the only way we can save the world.

Stay here. I'm going in after her. All available security to the gymnasium. Listen to me. She's not the one to blame. This is not how we avenge our son. Maybe not, but this is all I've got. Put down the gun, Jo. Joanne, no! [grunts] [zapping] [gasping] Malina. Malina? Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh! No! [groaning] No. No. You're gonna be okay. No, please, you have to protect her. Don't worry.
