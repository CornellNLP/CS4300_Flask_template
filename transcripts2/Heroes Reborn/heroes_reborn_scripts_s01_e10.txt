 I know all this has been really tough on you. 
 It's been a long night, but you're safe now. 
 We're together. 
 I promise you, we're going to find your brother. 
 Are the people who took him, the same people who are accusing me? 
 Yes. 
 Where'd they take him? 
 Place called Midian. 
 And that's where we're going to find him. 
 Malina. 
 You forgot your stuff. 
 Luke Collins. 
 I'm sorry, how do you two know each other? 
 He's the one who drove me here. 
 From Lake Ontario. 
 She saved my life and I think I still owe her for that. 
 What? What is it? 
 His wife was the one who killed Caspar. 
 I heard them talking before she started shooting. 
 My, uh, my ex-wife, sort off. 
 It's, uh, complicated. 
 Look, I'm an Evo and I just want to help. 
 Well I really appreciate you helping my granddaughter get here but-- 
 You're her grandfather? 
 Yeah, and I can take care of her from here. 
 That boy she's trying to find. 
 I really want to help you find him. 
 Why? 
 Because I've met him before. 
 Where did you meet him? 
 It doesn't matter anymore. 
 Look, Malina, she changed everything. 
 She showed me my destiny. 
 I genuinely want to help. 
 I think we're okay on our own. 
 Please. 
 Leave us alone.

 ♪ ♪ [gasps] [robotic whirring] [groans] [knock on door] [door opens] Good morning. How are you feeling? What happened? Where am I? You're at my house. You passed out last night. Passed out? What happened to the back of my neck? We weren't sure what was wrong with you, so I had my staff run some tests. Everything's normal. You must have just been exhausted. I had your clothes set out for you. That girl, who was at the hospital with the shadow powers, she's out there, isn't she? So, I can't use mine when's she's around? As a precaution. [scoffs] Until we trust each other. Oh, I'm never going to trust you. Where's my family? Do you mean Anne? The woman you call your mother, but isn't? Hmm, she left out that little detail, didn't she? She didn't tell you that you had a sister. Or that you're supposed to save the world until last week? I said where's my family? They're fine. Safe. As is your grandfather. Did you know we used to work together? Did he tell you about being brought to Primatech when you were seven years old? I never forgot that. To the same place where he and Caspar worked, bagging and tagging Evos. For someone who prides himself on the hard truth. He kept you in the dark. But I will explain everything. Why don't you get dressed? We'll talk downstairs. I believe in science. I believe in facts and data. What about the prophecy and this doomsday event that you don't want me to stop? What you're talking about is the reversal of the poles. How do you stop a celestial event? Tommy I have a solution. A way to start again after the H.E.L.E. Hiro Nakamura created a time bridge between the present and the future. My company has been building a colony there. Paving the way for mankind to reboot after the apocalypse. And unfortunately, your grandfather severed that temporal connection when he took Hiro from my facility. No, he rescued him because you were holding him against his will. I have scientists and engineers there. Right now, in the future. But they are cut off. Cut off from the present, from their families. If the bridge doesn't reopen, no one will escape the H.E.L.E. That's why I need you. None of this is the prophecy. We're supposed to stop the apocalypse. Tommy... there is no stopping it. If you don't reopen the bridge... Our species goes extinct. Then show me. If what you say is true, then I want to see it. Tell me when and where, we're going. [dramatic exotic music] ♪ ♪ Hey. How did you get here? Did Erica send you? What year are you from? Where's my father? Where's Ren? Okay, we're going to have to take her in. We just want to make sure that you're-- [screams] Ah. [grunting] [dramatic tribal music] ♪ ♪ No security. The only thing I could find was sewage pipes. Attack them from underneath. Yeah, it could work. There has to be another way. Maybe you should've stolen a blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours, since she runs the place. Your mother is using Micah and his powers to-- to control every single bit of information out there. We don't have much time. So, unless you have a better way to break in, that is the plan. I do. I do! And I think that sociopath mother of mine is gonna help us. We're just heading outside. Let's go. Eyes forward. I will have the rest of the Evos processed, ready, and willing, and sent to Gateway by tomorrow. We appreciate that, but we still need to find the girl. Any luck getting her protector to talk? Well, it's funny you should say that because I'm still working on her. Work fast, we're on our way. Don't worry. [door beeps] How are you today, Farah? Doctor says your gunshot wound is healing nicely. [sighs] I'm running out of time and patience. Where's the girl? [inhales sharply] Ah. Mind unlocking the handcuffs too? So I can choke you out. See now, that thought was easy to read. Hmm. You're tough. [chuckles] You know that? Here's the deal, Farah. All I need from you... is to know where that girl wandered off to? That's it. Who's watching her now? Noah Bennet? What about Angela Petrelli? You'll never break me. [groans] [sighs] So you saw combat? Helped the 'ole, U.S. of A. overseas. But do you know there's somebody else here who fought with you side-by-side. Carlos Gutierrez. That ring a bell? [chuckles] What do you say I bring him in here? Help you open up a little bit. You know, I found... when one secret is revealed, the deeper ones, they come so much easier. I got to say, I think today's gonna be our breakthrough day. What was she like? My mother. Tough... but thoughtful. She always rooted for the underdog. Stubborn. Not sure if she learned that from me or she just was. You remind me of her. Is that okay? Yeah. I just want you to know, leaving you and your brother behind was the hardest decision I ever had to make. It's okay. Angela told me why you did what you did. For our safety. What does Erica Kravid want with Tommy? Why did she kidnap him? This thing that's coming, the H.E.L.E., Erica's plan is to use Tommy's power to jump a limited number of people over it in to the distant future. Restart the world. But why wouldn't she want to save everyone? I think she likes humanity more than human beings. [laser zaps] Dude... you have like, the coolest power ever. This is the future. It's all gone. Nobody's here yet because you haven't decided to save them. No matter what, this was inevitable. Proof that you and your sister failed to stop the H.E.L.E.. [deep breathing] But this... This is the first city of the future. What? I call it Gateway. This how you can save mankind, Tommy. The choice is yours. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [overlapping chattering] [beeps] [keyboard clacking] [screams] Did anyone see that Shogun? [utensil drops] [overlapping chattering] [metals clinking] [keypad beeps] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Farah. [gunfire] Gutierrez! I need you to move your position now! [gunshots] [explosions] [yells in foreign language] Gutierrez. Gutierrez, Gutierrez they're lighting us up! [gunfire] [indistinct yelling] [panting] Okay, so you froze up. You had to expose yourself, use your powers to save his ass. He comes home a war hero. You go into hiding. And Angela Petrelli, called on you to have you take Malina. Take her where? Come on. Farah, take her where? Come on, Farah. Where is she? We could be together. You haven't told her that yet, have you? Did you know that he wanted to run away with you? Yeah, hasn't gotten over you, since you parted ways. Can't protect your brother. Can't protect the woman that you love. Can't protect your nephew. But he dresses up like a superhero. Where's Jose, you son of a-- - That's enough. [chuckles] Ah, you're as useless as you were in Afghanistan. And you, what were you thinking back then? Come on. There is something deep that you are not telling me, Farah. What is it? Once it comes out, everything else follows, that's the way this... Gutierrez! Get it there and use your weapon! Works. Oh. Oh. You're in love with him. All right, well, let's see if this shakes things loose. Huh? [gun cocks] Now tell me where Malina is. [panting] [dramatic music] She has a limp, but don't over do it. Slow and steady. Remember, if you don't pull this off, we're gonna join your friend Micah in there. Speak with authority. Like you own this place. Controlling, condescending, and humorless. God, she sounds awful. Miss Kravid, we weren't expecting you. It's exactly why we're here. Please don't look at my daughter that way. Taylor. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Now comes the hard part. Now, Farah, where's Malina going? Now you just tell me and you can let him go. Come on, Farah. This is the only way you're going to get out of this. Trust me. ♪ ♪ Tell me... where Malina is, Farah. I will kill him. Tell me where Malina is or I will kill him! This is easy for me! No! Please stop! I don't want him to die. I'll tell you. 
 
 ♪ ♪ Okay, let's hear it. I'm sorry, Director, but Erica Kravid is here to see you. Erica? [sighs] Um, all right, prepare the rest of the Evos immediately and tell Miss Kravid, that I will be with her in a moment. Now, Farah, you're gonna tell me everything about Malina and where she's heading. [bell dings] [thunder rumbling] I knew he'd follow us. Wait in the car for a minute. Nice car. Listen... I just want to help. Yeah. We heard you the first time, we're not interested. Oh, yeah, and where we you when she was crossing the country by herself? She's safe now, that's all that matters. Listen, Malina is meant to do something important. We both know this. And you, what? You just want to come along for the ride? Why don't you tell me how you knew where the boy was? [thunder rumbling] My wife and I, we were hunting Evos because we thought they'd killed our son on June 13th. It was, uh, I don't know, some misguided retribution. We were gonna kill him. Evos did not kill your son. Look, I don't know you okay, but something tells me you understand loss and what that does to a parent. You don't know anything about me. Okay, fine. Maybe I don't. What am I supposed to say? I am sorry. What I did wasn't right. The things that I've done, they will haunt me for the rest of my life. They--they brought me to try and kill myself, until your granddaughter saved me. There's got to be a reason behind that. Look, you have every reason not to trust me, but I am different now. Let's go, there's a big storm coming. Head back to base, we found the others. Copy that. [computer beeping] [whirring] [elevator dings] Who are you? Aah! [elevator dings] [panting] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [panting] ♪ ♪ Intruder! Intruder is here! [alarms blaring] [muffled yelling] How is this place gonna fit seven billion people? It's not. This is the first of many. All of which you are gonna fill. It's pretty crazy that I had to kidnap Noah Bennet's grandson in order to save the world. Please don't tell me you feel guilty. If it been me, I would have shot your old buddy. And we'd be holding Tommy's family hostage so he'd do what we want. I'm having a hard time believing you, right now. Do you see this? This is my power. To take away light, to take away the powers of others. I remember when you were just making crazy shadow puppets. You were my kid sister I was dropping off at college. Are you seriously okay with everything that's going on here? There's no going back, Quentin. This is who I am. At least Erica's found a use for it. Sometimes I think she understands me better than you do. [dramatic music] [overlapping chattering] Shogun! [speaks native language] [sighs] Sorry to keep you waiting. Had I know you were here, I would have met you at the door. Sometimes that's the best time to come. When no one's expecting you. Uh, yeah. I would've had all these assets prepared for you, had I known the time bridge was back in operation. I'm assuming that's what you-- that's what you want. I'm sorry, we haven't met yet. You are? Oh, my daughter. Taylor. I need to find Francis. I wonder if he knows where Francis is. Francis? Francis Culp. Why are you interested in Francis Culp? You read my mind. Yeah, that's sort off my thing. I need to talk to Micah Sanders. Micah? Aw, crap. What are you really doing here... Erica? [electricity crackles] [groans] That was close. See what else you could find. Then try to get your Truther friends in. I'll find Micah. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Oh, my God, this is... amazing. All of it. I don't know what to say. I had a lot of help. Why is there a scar on the back of my neck? I put you in a machine to try to steal your powers. But it didn't work. Why? Because you're different. Time travel is an incredible power, Tommy. The fate of the world was in the balance and I made a call. And here we are. Okay, I'll help, but don't lie to me. Thank you. What I saw out there-- the wasteland, I don't want that to happen to my family, my friends. I want them here. I want as many people as I can take here. Of course, we will make that possible. But first, we need more supplies and resources. Everything possible to help make sure that we have the best chance at survival. Thank you. A group of scientist were attacked under the arch by a Japanese girl. She's a tenacious little construct. Hunt it down and kill it. And bring me Otomo. [suspenseful music] [groaning] [door clicks] How did you--how did you know that wasn't me? Oh, I didn't. What? Well ask a question! Find out first! You could've killed me. 50/50 is pretty good odds. Yeah, if you're shooting somebody that doesn't matter. You got that right. So did she talk? Uh, yes. Yes, she talked. Malina knows about Odessa, she's on her way. Do you have a lead on where she is now? That girl cannot connect with her brother. We are closing in. Yes. Taylor Kravid is here and this guy tried to pass himself off as Erica. That is who you should be focusing on and anybody else who's trying to infiltrate us. We're already taking care of it. Move it. The Director doesn't like the Evos to hear gunfire. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [grunting] [buzzing] [grunts] Come on, Farah. Get up! The hell with it. The slap did the trick. [chuckles] You came back. You once told me to be brave. [gun clicks] How about I start today? Let's go. This is bad. We have to do something. We're dead center of the path of this thing. [people chattering] Stay here, I'm gonna--Malina! Careful! [wind howling] Malina! Sir, stay in your car, please. It's safer in your car. I wouldn't go in there if I were you. [winds howling] Get back in your car! It's not safe! [thunder rumbling] Oh, my God. [whimpering] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] Whoa! Hands where I can see them. I'm not one of them. I mean, I don't work here and it doesn't look like you do, either. Behind you! [gunshot] [grunts] [gunshot] [grunts] And who exactly are you? I'm with the Hero Truthers. Don't move. Hero Truthers. Jose told me something about them. But how can we be sure you're not lying? I'm here looking for our leader, Micah Sanders. Now please... stop pointing your guns at me. We can't trust her. Why would I warn you about the guards? Something tells me we're here for the same thing and we are running out of time. Yeah, we are. How you doing today, Micah? Erica Kravid is up to something. She's got a list of everyone going to the future. I need you to find it for me. I have to know that I'm on that list, Micah. I'm not getting left behind. [computer beeping] That's it. That's it. Yes, that's it. That's it. [sighs] Odessa. [bus engine roaring] [tense music] [electronic zap] Good. Tommy, there are two others I'd like you send back. You're not afraid that I'll leave you here? No, I think we trust each other now. I should stay. No, go back and contact Harris and then find his sister. Go. When can we bring the others here? Soon. Okay. [electronic zaps] [grunts] [screams] Guards, get him out of there, go! Who are you? We don't have much time. Master of time and space, it is my mission to free you. [electronic zaps] No! [wind howling] [whimpering] Come on! [winds howling] [gasps] [screaming] [thunder rumbling, electricity crackling] [whimpering] [winds calming] Look at that! She caused this! You all right? You're an Evo. You caused this. You people need to be stopped before this gets worse. [gun cocks] All : Whoa! I think maybe everybody just needs to take a step back. [dramatic music] Who's that? Watch yourself. Malina. Come on. Come on, honey. My grandfather. Where is he? [sighs] He was... He was somewhere near that car I think. Oh, my God. No. He has to be here somewhere. We have to go. I'm not leaving without him. Yeah, there's two of them. Malina, we have to go now! Don't! The gates. Open them. Move. Where is everyone? The last transport to Odessa just left. [electronic beeping] He should be out there. Come on. [suspenseful music] [panting] ♪ ♪ Run! ♪ ♪
