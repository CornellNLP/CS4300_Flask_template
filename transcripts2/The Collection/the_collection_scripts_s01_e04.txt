 You're seven weeks out, Paul. These won't cut it. 
 Claude pulled them from the last show for a reason. He thinks they're sh1t. 
 I pulled them. This is my house, my name. 
 Are you an artist? 
 No. I make princesses. 
 Claude : He knows all about us. 
 The President's office is searching for a designer to dress the world, starting with Paris. 
 If your next collection fails, Monsieur Sabine, our partnership is effectively over and you will owe me everything. 
 If he's upset about ten metres of velvet, we'll use 15. 
 For some Godforsaken reason, your past was more important to you than your future and I had to save an embarrassing situation. 
 By making it more embarrassing. 
 I just wanted to go back. 
 They didn't even let me hold him. 
 The adoption will soon be formalised. 
 God has provided a family that's well off and can offer this child a future. 
 Nina, what have you done? 
 I heard you wanted models with short hair. 
 But you made it clear... 
 I changed my mind. 
 But I won't do it on a seamstress's salary. 
 I told my friends we'd meet them at the restaurant. 
 I'll... see you tomorrow. 
 Can you think of anybody who might judge Monsieur Sabine or resent him? 
 [SCOFFS] Besides his brother. 
 He was interested in me. 
 Mother : What does he know about us? 
 [GROANING] 
 Victor : I just wanted to let you know it was taken care of. 
 I don't need to know any more about it, Victor. Neither does Paul. Ever! 
 Claude : What's this? 
 My castle. 
 Did you make it yourself? 
 No. One day it just showed up. 
 This pile of rocks.

 [CAMERA CLICKS AND WHIRS] 
 Helen : Oh, you made it. 
 Lovely to see you. 
 Thanks so much for coming. 
 [CURTAIN IS PULLED OPEN] 
 [FOOTSTEPS] 
 Helen : Can I help you with your coat? 
 Do we have enough? 
 More than enough, Monsieur. 
 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] 
 Helen. 
 Monsieur Trouvier. 
 Where would you like me to sit? On the radiator? 
 I wasn't sure you'd be attending. 
 My son is unveiling the most important collection of his life. 
 Where would you expect me to be? 
 Some place where you're welcome. 
 Where have you been? 
 In my office, drilling a hole in the wall... with my forehead. 
 Nervous? 
 No. No, if this is a disaster, I can just crawl into bed. 
 Make it big enough for two. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 [CHATTER] 
 [CLICKS FINGERS] 
 Fire. 
 I could move this seam. You would still have the long waist. 
 I don't want to sacrifice the keyhole in the back. 
 I agree, Monsieur, but as it is, this will require more panels. 
 At least a few more metres. 
 But what if we pad the hips? 
 That would help. 
 Can I make a suggestion? 
 If we overlap these two panels, we could preserve the silhouette. 
 But still need more material. 
 Claude, could you write that down, please? Four more metres. 
 Monsieur. 
 You have a guest. Someone from Meudon. 
 Excuse me for a moment. 
 So, Juliette, if we open up this and... still... have the panel... 
 I didn't mean to sneak up on you. Sorry. 
 Paul : There's no need to apologise. 
 What's this about? 
 There's been an incident out at your cottage, Monsieur. 
 Would you prefer we speak in private? 
 No, this is private enough, Inspector. Please, go on. 
 A body has been found on the rear corner of your property. 
 Buried in a shallow grave. 
 The victim was male. 
 He's been out there for over a month or so. 
 Stabbed multiple times, possibly an ambush. 
 Have you been there recently? 
 I'm four weeks away from showing a new collection. 
 I'm... lucky if I make it to my bed in Paris. 
 [CHUCKLES] I see. Well, erm... someone took advantage of your absence and thought the kitchen garden would be a convenient place to park a dead body. 
 Who found it? 
 A dog. 
 Your neighbour's child has been using the property as her playground. 
 Your barn is her castle, so to speak. 
 I'm sorry. I'm lost. 
 The corpse was her prisoner. 
 Evidently the dog dug him up and, erm... the little girl was aware of the victim for a couple of days before her mother caught on. It's a bit gruesome, isn't it? 
 One can only imagine that the child was unaffected because of what she saw during the war. 
 Do you know who this... victim is? 
 We're fairly certain that it was a thief who'd been fleecing our town last year. 
 He went missing and must have made the mistake of returning. 
 Some people... [CHUCKLES] don't trust the police, and so they take matters into their own hands. 
 My God. 
 Oh, please, Mr Sabine, I assure you that the countryside isn't crawling with savages. 
 It's just that... we still live in a chaotic time. 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 Stay away from the property. At least for now. 
 I may have more questions for you. 
 Thank you, Inspector. 
 Mm-mm. 
 Inspector. 
 What do you know about this? Sit! 
 Sit! 
 [LOW CHATTER] 
 Ugh. It smells rank. 
 It's not a fragrance, you idiot, it's an astringent. 
 Still wouldn't put that on my face. 
 It's probably goat piss. 
 So what? 
 The ancient Egyptians darkened their eyebrows using crocodile sh1t. Isn't that right, Nina? 
 Uh, I've never heard that before. 
 Well, you have now. 
 But I'm sure you've known girls who've done worse. 
 To attract a man, that is. 
 [GIGGLES] 
 Where did that come from? 
 It was a gift. 
 Fittings are running late, ladies. 
 Monsieur is delayed in a meeting. 
 How are you doing? Have the girls made space for you? 
 Oh, we're thrilled. 
 Nice to have someone in here who can... fix a hem. 
 She's not working in that department any more, Dominique. 
 Take care of yourself in this coming month. 
 Monsieur's given you each an advance on your salary. 
 Put this towards vitamins, cosmetics, eating healthy, whatever it takes to keep you swans. 
 Why, Charlotte, you flatter us. 
 No, I don't. He does. 
 [JAUNTY MUSIC] 
 [WOMAN SINGS IN FRENCH] 
 [BILLY CHATTERS] 
 Great. 
 I've wanted to tell you, I've tried to go back twice to the cottage, but your mother said, if that little girl's so mean... 
 My mother? 
 What does my mother have to do with this? 
 She said he was going to blackmail the family. 
 Who? 
 The sailor. 
 She wanted him gone. She said you would too. 
 When did my mother start speaking for me? 
 She said the less you knew, the more we could protect you. 
 You don't work for my mother! 
 [DOOR SLAMS] 
 Nina. What are you doing here? 
 I thought you were in the models' cabine. 
 Maybe... you want to keep this. 
 For luck? 
 Of course. Thank you. 
 Well, see you at home, then. 
 You thought this was... the best place to hide your stupid mistake? 
 I tried. 
 After I dropped your mother off, I tried different places to get rid of him. 
 I almost got caught. 
 Didn't know where else to go. There was no-one out there... 
 Except a curious dog and a morbid little girl. 
 [SLAMS DESK HARD] 
 There. That looks lovely on you. 
 Can we fetch Marianne? 
 I need somebody who understands the mystery of my upper arms. 
 She knows how to tuck them into my bust. 
 I'll see if she can pop down. 
 [FOOTSTEPS RETREAT] 
 Ohhh! 
 Look what your genius made for me. 
 I'd hug you but one of these pins might draw blood. 
 I didn't know you were here. I would have packed enough for three. 
 No, no, no, no. No, no, I'm not eating this month. 
 Neither is Paul. I haven't seen him for days. 
 You can't come up with something like this by putting in bankers' hours. 
 At least you married somebody who works. 
 My last one just wanted an allowance for the track. 
 Now, is there anything in here we can drink. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realise this was more than a meal. 
 Doesn't matter. I don't think it would have made much of an impact. 
 The others haven't. 
 [TAP RUNNING] 
 [EXHALES] 
 Who was the visitor? 
 Police officer from Meudon. 
 Why did he want to speak to you? 
 A property line dispute out at the cottage. 
 When was the last time you spoke to Maman? 
 Er... this morning. I gave her a key to my flat. 
 She can look after the cat. 
 He's been sick. 
 He says that it's about... this perfume deal. 
 But I think it's something else. 
 It's like we're living in two different worlds. 
 Well, you are. 
 They're called male and female. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I've had husbands from three different continents and they have all needed to feel like they were in charge. 
 And you know how I did it? 
 By wearing shoes with lousy heels. 
 What? What are you talking about? You don't own shoes with lousy heels. 
 The hell I don't. 
 I always wear them on the second date and I find the perfect kerb to fall off, so they can catch me and feel strong. 
 You've just gotta fall off a kerb, honey. 
 I just... 
 I think it's a little late for a second date. 
 Marjorie, it's been eight years. 
 I want to be his partner. 
 And you can be. 
 You can. 
 You just gotta be smart about it. 
 Do it quietly. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Helen. 
 Uh-oh. 
 I asked for Marianne and I got you. 
 Have you come down here to cut off my sleeves? 
 Hello, Marjorie. 
 I brought you some supper. 
 Hmm. 
 How thoughtful. Unfortunately I don't have time. 
 I'll enjoy it when I get back from my meeting. 
 Ah, Charlotte. 
 Monsieur, your car is ready. 
 Victor is waiting for you. 
 Place those invoices on my desk so I can look at them when I get back. 
 You know, I can't breathe in this thing. It's... cutting off my circulation. Help me, will you? 
 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] 
 [GIRLS GIGGLE] 
 [THUD] 
 [GASPS] 
 [GASPS] 
 I expected King Kong. 
 And it turns out it's... Fay Wray. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. 
 Or Paris. 
 [CHUCKLES] We're, uh... tougher than we look. 
 Nina, wait. Can I... can I, uh... can I show you something? 
 I've been asked to do a visual record of the collection's progress. 
 Sort of a countdown to curtain. And I got this beauty of your ma. 
 She can sit like that for hours. 
 Let me see the others. 
 A nice one of Monsieur. 
 [CHUCKLES] I'm not sure how Eloise will feel about this. 
 But at least her mop is slim and elegant. 
 And that's about as best I could do of Claude. 
 He's a little camera shy. 
 Got any idea why? 
 He's supposed to be the manager, right? 
 He is. He's Monsieur's brother. 
 Maybe that's the problem. 
 I've got a brother myself. 
 He saw combat while I sorted maps behind a desk. 
 He resents the hell out of me for it. 
 Monsieur does not resent Claude. 
 Does that work both ways? 
 Who put this in your head? 
 Dominique? 
 I don't need anybody to tell me what I see with my own eyes. 
 But you need someone to tell you the truth. 
 Monsieur worked very hard to get where he is. 
 His brother looks up to him. And they treat the rest of us like family. 
 Nina. 
 But you're choosing to spend time with someone who's more closely related to reptiles. 
 Nina... 
 Dominique and I, we've been to a few clubs, some cafés. 
 She's introduced me to her friends. 
 Then why are you bringing me the gift? 
 There are many girls in Paris. 
 You'll go broke giving all of us gifts, GI Joe. 
 We don't exist for your pleasure. 
 [CAT MEOWS] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 How many people does it take to feed a cat? 
 I came here to see you. 
 What's wrong? 
 You're wrong. 
 I have some news. 
 I don't know what your cards tell you, but this might be your lucky day. 
 I've spoken to Victor... and the police... who think that fellow he buried... on my property... is a local thief, and not a friend of your son. 
 Paul, let me explain. 
 You're more desperate and dangerous than I thought. 
 You should be thanking me. 
 For what? 
 Putting everything I've worked for, our entire future, in jeopardy? 
 You were already in jeopardy. He knew too much about the war. 
 There was no other choice. He knew the truth about you. 
 He knew Claude was the one that matters. 
 All he had to do was open his big trap to the wrong person. 
 The one that matters? 
 You know what I'm talking about. 
 What I know is that... from this point on, you're done. 
 You do nothing... nothing without consulting me first. 
 If your soup needs salt, you ask me how much. 
 You need to piss, you hold it till I tell you to let it go. 
 You're done making decisions that affect anyone else in this family. Is that clear? 
 Who the hell do you think you're talking to? 
 [SHE GASPS] 
 Do you want me to tell Claude who you really are? 
 Because I will. I will! 
 Who's gonna protect him when I'm gone? 
 It's my fault he's the way he is. 
 You have a wife. He has no-one. And he never will. 
 Claude will do just fine without you. 
 We all will. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] 
 [EXCITED CHATTER] 
 What about the wedding dress? 
 What about it? 
 Has Monsieur decided... 
 He hasn't. 
 Model : Ow! 
 Anyone got pins? I need pins now! 
 Stop walking on clouds. 
 You've got to be a cloud walking. 
 Look, try... try these. 
 Try again. 
 What you need to do, you need to pretend it's Sunday. 
 You've got nowhere to go and you've got all day to get there. 
 Now try again. Go. 
 Take your time, take your time! 
 What did I just say? Take your time. 
 If it were Sunday, I'd be sleeping. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Oh, what? 
 This was a mistake. I don't want to disappoint Monsieur. 
 You won't! Besides, you shouldn't be worrying about that. 
 He couldn't walk in those heels at gunpoint. 
 Stay there and... put your shoes back on. 
 [GENTLE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] 
 OK. Up! 
 Stay still, stay still. 
 Try again. 
 Watch me, watch me. 
 [MAN SINGS IN FRENCH] 
 The dress follows you. 
 You don't follow the dress. 
 Turn around. 
 [LAUGHS] That's it. That's it. That's it. 
 That's it. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 [LAUGHS] 
 [BIZET'S "HABANERA" BY CARMEN] 
 And turn. 
 Come towards me. That's it. 
 Just keep walking. 
 Don't. 
 [CHARLES TRENET'S "HOP! HOP!"] 
 ["THE BLUE DANUBE WALTZ"] 
 [GASPS] 
 [TURNS RADIO OFF] 
 Please, don't... don't stop cos of me. 
 I should get home. 
 Nina, I thought a lot about what you said that day, you know, upstairs and... 
 I was out of line. 
 I put you in an awkward position and I'm... I'm sorry. 
 And I should have said that weeks ago, but, you know... it's just... it's been so crazy around here. 
 I don't even remember what I said. 
 I do. And, um... and you were right. I... 
 You are not here for my... pleasure. 
 But it is a pleasure... to see a girl, who once said that these dresses were for other people, looking... so... comfortable in them now. 
 [LIGHT CLICKS] 
 Oh, sorry. I'll... do the stairs... again. 
 Oh, no. Eloise, please come in. It's fine. I was just leaving. 
 
 
 
 [BIRDSONG] 
 [LEAVES RUSTLING] 
 I'd like to try to cover this clasp. 
 [LOW CHATTER] 
 [WHISPERS] 
 Take a spin round the floor. 
 Monsieur Gambon. I wish... 
 I was in the neighbourhood. 
 I thought I'd stop by and give my regards. 
 I should have realised you'd have scant time for a social call the week of your show. 
 So, are you ready for an audience? 
 We will be. Will you be joining us? 
 I'll try my best. 
 And what about Monsieur Trouvier? 
 He'll be here. 
 If he's asked. 
 So this wasn't a social call? 
 We have a lot invested in this partnership working and it would be a frightful embarrassment to the President and all parties involved if Monsieur Trouvier felt himself excluded from the début. 
 He's been invited. 
 But my silent partner has remained silent for weeks. 
 I'm not quite sure if he's hoping for me to succeed or fail. 
 Well, then, let me enlighten you. 
 I dined with him last night and he seemed quite enthusiastic about the work of another designer. 
 Then you've answered my question. 
 It's not too late. 
 Just make sure your partner's given a choice seat. 
 Pardon. Monsieur, you have a phone call. 
 They said it's urgent. 
 Please, take it. Not to worry. I'll let myself out. 
 I let myself in. 
 I'll see you on Friday, then. 
 What is this about? My mother? 
 Someone called Bompard. 
 He said he's a detective. 
 Billy? 
 Billy? 
 [PIGEONS COOING] 
 Paul : I'm sorry. I'm confused. 
 Are you saying that the man you thought was dead and buried is still alive? 
 Apparently he was arrested last night at the train station in Lyon. 
 I see. 
 So, do you know who it is that was found on my property? 
 Not yet but... we will. 
 Which will require us re-opening the investigation. 
 I'm sorry to trouble you, Monsieur Sabine No, it's no trouble. If I can be of any help, please let me know. 
 We'll need to see the documents from when you bought the house. 
 I'll forward them to you. 
 Well, it might be better to deliver them yourself. 
 It would be helpful to meet there. At the property. 
 Have you any time this afternoon? 
 Say, erm... three o'clock? 
 I'll make the time. 
 Thank you. 
 See you then. 
 Bye. 
 [HANGS UP RECEIVER] 
 I'll bring the car around. 
 No. 
 No. You'll stay here. 
 I'll drive myself. 
 You've done enough. 
 [LIFT RUMBLES] 
 [DOORS CLUNK OPEN] 
 [LOW MUSIC AND CHATTER] 
 May I? 
 What are you doing? 
 It's not how Monsieur designed it. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Helen : Hello. 
 What are you doing here in the middle of the day? 
 I had to find some papers. 
 How was lunch with Marjorie? 
 Well, if you ever need a new press agent, she's your girl. 
 Is there anyone she doesn't know? 
 Her connections may come in handy some day. 
 That day is Friday. 
 Wait. Papers? For what? 
 Hm? Oh, there's a situation out at the cottage. 
 A property line dispute. I've got to go out there. 
 Now? 
 They're practically setting up chairs in the salon. 
 They need you here. 
 Here, give them to me. I'll take them. Victor can drive me. 
 No! 
 Thank you... I'll take care of it. 
 Why are you going to the cottage? 
 Just tell me the truth. 
 The truth is... I am overwhelmed. 
 I don't need you to become an additional burden. 
 I'm not a burden. I'm your wife. 
 What's going on? 
 My mother killed that sailor. 
 I already knew that. 
 How would you know that? 
 Let's just say I had my suspicions and you just... confirmed it. 
 What are you gonna do now? 
 I give this detective the paperwork he's asked for. 
 Then I'll figure something out. 
 Does Claude know? 
 Please, don't tell him, Helen. 
 Will you do that for me? 
 Please promise me he'll never know. 
 I'm confused. Where am I in all this? 
 I see a lovely spot reserved for the other Madame Sabine but I... I seem to be among the missing. 
 It's still a work in progress, madame. 
 That's why I did it in pencil. 
 Some guests haven't even responded yet. 
 Well, here's my response. I'll be here. 
 And I'd like my chair to have four legs and a back. 
 I'll certainly pass that on to Monsieur. 
 He's lucky to have you, Charlotte. 
 My son's always gravitated towards sharp, talented women. 
 Most men find that threatening. 
 God knows I scared off enough. 
 I bet you have, too. 
 I've little time to think of anything but my work. 
 Good for you. It'll pay off. 
 I've a good feeling about this collection. 
 Do you? 
 Oh, yes. 
 It's in the cards. 
 Excuse me. 
 What was their reaction? 
 Who? 
 The other girls. 
 When they found out Monsieur picked you to be the bride. 
 Juliette, have you taken your break yet? 
 You're functioning on very little sleep. 
 I... I'm nearly done. 
 I've got it from here. Go. 
 Eat something. 
 Have you taken a break? 
 I don't need a break. 
 I need this dress to be perfect. 
 If you leave it pinned, Mama, I could finish the stitching. 
 That's not a terrible idea. 
 At least I'd know what you were doing with your free time. 
 What does that mean? 
 What were you thinking? 
 Sending a donation like that to a novice? 
 What were you after, Nina? 
 I wanted her to know that I was earning more money now. 
 That I was in a better place. 
 No. 
 You wanted to bribe her for information. 
 Which only shows how naive and foolish you still are. 
 It wasn't a bribe. 
 And, anyway, it's none of your business. 
 Really? 
 Then why was this addressed to me and not to you? 
 Where's the money? 
 I'll hold on to that. 
 You don't think things through, Nina. 
 It's my money. I earned it. And I want it back. 
 That child already belongs to someone else. 
 You can't buy back what's no longer yours. 
 And why would you even want to? 
 Do you want this, your costume, or something that you might really wear one day? 
 No man is interested in raising someone else's child. 
 Think about your future. 
 I don't know what my future holds. 
 But if you don't start letting me make my own decisions, it's not going to include you. 
 Can you think of anyone who might want to compromise your reputation? 
 Anyone in particular with whom you've had a negative encounter in the last six months? 
 Inspector, I'm days away from what could be a turning point in my career. 
 There may be more than one person who'd relish my fall from grace. 
 But I have no personal idea of who that might be. 
 Oh, it sounds like quite an event. 
 Could there be an extra seat for me? 
 [LOW CHATTER] 
 That was quite a break. What did you do? 
 Roast a hen? 
 I was only gone for 15... 
 Were you asleep when you stitched this? 
 I used the navy thread so it... 
 I don't give a damn about the colour. It's about pride. 
 Workmanship. 
 We are not sewing flour bags. 
 Let me do it over. 
 This isn't a school! 
 We don't have time to correct your stupid foolish mistakes! 
 What are you looking at? Is that panel finished yet? 
 Go to work! 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Oh. 
 Didn't expect you to be back until tomorrow. 
 What's that? 
 A source of conflict. 
 I have three different seating charts and your mother wants to be front and centre on every one of them. 
 She also insisted on trying on the same suit that Marjorie plans on wearing to the show. 
 And did you tell her that suit and that seat were already taken? 
 I tried, but she insists on wearing black and white. 
 She says, "It's in the cards." 
 Will you join me? 
 Thank you. 
 If we locked Marjorie and my mother in the same room with one dress, who do you think would come out wearing it? 
 I think Marjorie would have the top half and your mother would have the bottom. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 Mm. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 It won't matter where anyone sits. 
 This show is going to be brilliant from every angle. 
 If we can just make it to the show. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Hm? 
 With that detective? 
 Oh, that. 
 It's all taken care of. It was just a misunderstanding. I've cleared it up. 
 Good. 
 But, you know... if I can ever be helpful... don't hesitate to ask. 
 [FLOURISH OF JAZZ] 
 [CHATTER] 
 Nearly every seat's taken, so we should start soon. 
 Do you still want to speak to the staff before we begin? 
 [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
 Billy : Helen. 
 Mother : Is there room up here for me? 
 Why would you want to be up here? 
 This is exactly where I always imagined I'd be, my darling. 
 Right at your side. 
 Well, let me get you a seat. 
 No, I'll be fine, really. 
 How's the cat? 
 Er... much better. 
 He only vomits now when I mention your name. 
 Lovely. 
 [GROANS] I can't breathe! Can you loosen it? 
 Tighten it. That'll teach you to make fun of my goat piss. 
 Billy : Turn your shoulder... 
 Sorry, Nina. Could you just hold that for me? That's beautiful. 
 Just look to me. 
 That's really nice. 
 [CHATTER] 
 Claude, your brother wants to say something to us. 
 Upstairs. 
 Everyone upstairs. Monsieur wants to speak. 
 Hurry! Move! [CLAPS HANDS] 
 Nina, Billy. 
 Come on, everyone. Up we go, up we go. 
 Dominique, please, hurry. Monique. 
 For the past eight weeks, we've kept the lights burning late and the shutters tightly closed, so that nothing would distract us. 
 No-one could look over our shoulders. 
 Today we open the shutters and share the work. 
 We aim for perfection and pray that we come close. 
 Every one of you has made enormous sacrifices to get us here. 
 I hope you feel that it wasn't in vain. 
 I certainly don't. 
 I salute you. 
 To the collection. 
 All : The collection. 
 ["QUIZAS, QUIZAS, QUIZAS"] 
 Marjorie : You have to have that one. 
 [MURMURING] 
 Sorry. 
 [LOW CHATTER] 
 Beautiful frock. 
 How do you like that? 
 Wow. It's brilliant. 
 Woman : Look at the size of her waist. Look at that. 
 Looks like it's flown here. 
 [MURMURING AND GASPS] 
 Man : Ohhhh! 
 Ohhh. 
 Beautiful. Look at that. 
 [QUIETLY] Holy f*ck. I wanna be buried in that. 
 Hey. My gloves. Take them, take them. Take them! 
 [SNIFFS] What's that smell? 
 [GASPS] The dress! 
 Call someone! Get Monsieur Sabine! 
 [PANICKED SHOUTING] 
 Oh, my goodness! 
 Billy : What happened? 
 Unplug your lamp. 
 That dress was nowhere near my lamp. 
 I wouldn't have put that there. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Who moved the rack? 
 How did this happen? 
 Doesn't matter. It did. 
 What are you doing? 
 Just close the door. 
 Close it! 
 Carry on. 
 Paul : Leave it alone. We'll end with something else. 
 The dress burned. 
 I don't know how it happened. 
 We don't need a bride... 
 You close with the bride! 
 Flor, Dominique, go out again. 
 But they've already seen... 
 A second look, together. 
 I need tulle... 
 You have to hide... 
 I've got this! 
 At least let me help you. 
 Another in the back. 
 What about the silhouette? 
 It'll be the same as the front. 
 Hurry! 
 Scissors. 
 Everybody keep moving. You're in a show. 
 Can you hide all that? Claude? 
 Nina, you should get changed. Can somebody help her? Please! 
 Ohhh, stop! Take it from the petticoat. 
 Paul : What are we gonna do? 
 I can hide this in the fold. 
 Claude... 
 Just get me the scissors. 
 Here. 
 I'll tack it back to the... Hold this piece. 
 This will work. 
 Here. Lace. 
 [GASPS AND MURMURS] 
 Marjorie : Bravo! 
 Bravo! 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 Marjorie : Bravo! 
 Crowd : Bravo! 
 Bravo! 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Bravo! 
 Bravo! 
 Marjorie : How about that? 
 [APPLAUSE CONTINUES] 
 [CHEERING] 
 [JAUNTY TUNE] 
 No, thanks. 
 [POP] 
 Paul : You're a natural. Have fun. 
 Monsieur Trouvier seemed impressed. 
 A little shocked. 
 Ah... 
 Congratulations... 
 Ashes and gloom are over, darling. Romance is back. 
 Now, Mr Sabine has given us a new look and I'm sure as hell ready to wear it. [LAUGHS] 
 You can write that down. 
 Man : So what exactly inspired you? 
 I'd like to say that it all starts with the sleeve, Monsieur, but I'm afraid it's just not true. 
 It starts with the type of woman you want to design for. 
 You certainly found your muse. 
 No, the muse is my wife. 
 Where's Claude? 
 I don't know. 
 I hope, wherever he is, he's celebrating, too. 
 Claude : So won't your lady friend be missing you? 
 No. She has other things to distract her. 
 Champagne, gossip... free food. 
 And should she come looking for you, do you have a name? 
 Cesar. 
 You? 
 Claude. 
 What's this? 
 I don't recall seeing this one. 
 That's because you were looking at me. 
 [PIANO MUSIC] 
 [CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS] 
 Who are they? 
 I beg your pardon? 
 The tardy couple who nearly missed the first dress. How do we know them? 
 I don't. 
 Monsieur. 
 I didn't know you were still here. 
 I... wanted to talk to Nina but... there's so many people around her, I thought I'd wait. 
 Monsieur has invited her to a small after-party. 
 Right. Of course. 
 Well, I'll see her on Monday, then. 
 If you still want me to come in. 
 You'd better be here. 
 The real work is about to begin. 
 We'll be doing Nina's work, too. 
 It's just us, now, Juliette. 
 Can I walk to the metro with you? 
 Yes, I'd like that. 
 Jules. 
 Ah. Just the man I'm looking for. 
 You were looking for me? 
 Yes. 
 I wanted to speak to you in private but I wouldn't dare interrupt your legion of admirers. 
 Excuse me. 
 Are you one of them? 
 Well, let's see if all this enthusiasm translates to sales, hm? 
 Enjoy your moments. 
 They never get as good as this again. 
 We'll talk soon. Hm? 
 Ah. So you're out here. 
 So that could have gone either way, huh? 
 The wedding dress. 
 I guess that's what separates mere dressmakers from Paul Sabine. 
 I never properly thanked you. For the lovely card. 
 [SCOFFS] Oh, please. That was nothing. 
 Why, uh... Vivien Leigh? 
 I mean, there's a lot of beautiful movie stars. 
 A few of them were downstairs tonight, admiring you. 
 What is it about her... 
 She has fire in her eyes. 
 But she's not willing to admit when she's afraid. 
 Are you? Afraid? 
 I know I am. [CHUCKLES] 
 Once the master finds out that it was my light that torched that dress, uh... 
 I'm guessing my days here are pretty much numbered. 
 It was an accident. 
 It was a pricy one. 
 About two months' wages. 
 I'll leave Paris owing him. 
 I don't know. Maybe everything happens for a reason, though, right? 
 I didn't know what I was looking for when I came here but... 
 I certainly know what I'm leaving with. 
 I should be thanking you. 
 [SHE SIGHS] 
 [CAR ENGINE IDLES] 
 I need to tell you something. But not here. 
 Has Monsieur Sabine sent you? 
 No. 
 Come on. Get in.
