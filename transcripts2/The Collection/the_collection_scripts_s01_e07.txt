 He was only just adopted. 
 It might be easier for you to get him back if you had the father's support. 
 It's Claude. 
 Did you find out their name, the couple who have him? 
 Some scruffy Cinderella playing dress-up in my clothes. 
 Where is my bag? It was hanging on the back of this chair! 
 Wait! Where's the film? 
 Is this what he's looking for? 
 Monsieur Rossi, what brings you here? 
 Your boss made more than a few trips to Berlin and Vienna. 
 Then publish the story and leave him alone. 
 The papers he bought for us kept us from going to a place where nobody came back. 
 A body has been found on your property, buried in a shallow grave. 
 My mother killed that sailor. 
 You want the world to match what's swirling round in your head. 
 Paul, he'll never have what you have. 
 Scissors! 
 If I can ever be helpful, don't hesitate to ask. 
 Your brother might be willing to live with an arrangement, but I am not. 
 I want her gone. 
 She's not who you need now. 
 You need me. 
 What excuse will you give for your better half? 
 Not your wife. Your brother. 
 Cesar Cassatt. 
 My brother asked him to find you a position in their company. 
 Dominique! Stop!

 Charlotte. 
 Why are you here? 
 I thought we agreed that it would be best if-- 
 I have seven fittings today. 
 Six tomorrow. Nine on Wednesday. Do you want to see my book, monsieur? 
 Please don't make this any more difficult-- 
 My job is to comfort the clients, not you. 
 The sales aren't complete until the outfits are hanging in their closets. 
 What do you want, Charlotte? 
 What I've earned. 
 Helen : Poor Dominique. Her body will recover. 
 But apparently there is a wound that goes from her ear to her chin. 
 The right side of her face is... 
 sh1t. 
 Well... 
 Maybe Paul should pass these on. 
 You left the château early. 
 And Paul said you were driven home by Cesar Cassatt. 
 Stop fishing, Helen. 
 Yeah, the playboy likes to play with boys more than girls. 
 Big f*cking surprise. 
 Doesn't stop the b*st*rd from marrying some poor clueless creature this summer. 
 Considering who his family is, he probably doesn't have a choice. 
 We all have a choice. 
 You might want to send Monsieur Trouvier's daughter a note. 
 Cecile was crushed that you left. 
 I'm not good at notes. 
 She'll figure it out on her own. 
 Claude? 
 Mm. 
 I think you're wrong. 
 I'm not telling you to be two different people, but try to let strangers like you before deciding that they shouldn't. 
 You might be surprised. 
 There's no reason that you can't be you. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 I guess she must have had one of her friends grab my camera at the bar. 
 Maybe she wanted that film to hold Monsieur to ransom. 
 I'm just guessing. 
 One thing that's pretty clear is she wanted to be the one wearing that wedding gown. 
 I should go see her. 
 Wait. You're not...? 
 I don't think she wants to see you right now. 
 What would you do, if you couldn't do this any more? 
 What? 
 Take pictures. 
 What if it wasn't just your camera? 
 What if you lost your eyes? 
 Hey, it is too early in the day to start thinking like that. 
 Right? Dominique's gonna be fine. 
 You don't know that. 
 She may not have a family to turn to. 
 Don't be fooled by pictures. 
 That dog, it belonged to my neighbour. 
 So did the car. 
 It was my father's idea. 
 Everything was borrowed. 
 Even my mother's smile came from a previous life. 
 One before children. 
 Paul : Helen's already spoken with her uncle. 
 There are top-notch surgeons on his staff. 
 I should have listened to your mother's cards. 
 I think you're in better hands with Uncle Edgar. 
 My mother's medical expertise begins and ends with leeches. 
 Is that the magazine spread? 
 May I see it? 
 You're on the cover. 
 I knew I'd hate this angle. 
 We look like hungry horses. 
 He was with her when she stepped off the kerb. 
 Juliette... 
 Pardon, monsieur. 
 Were you able to pick up more of this? 
 I didn't, I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll get it later. 
 Is it true? 
 What? 
 About Dominique's face? 
 Er... 
 I think so. 
 What's this? 
 Why is this here? 
 Charlotte gave it to Marianne. 
 She said Monsieur wanted it made for a specific client. 
 What client? 
 When did he ask this? 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 If I had to give up the camera, I think I could happily drive a cab. 
 Without eyes? 
 Ah, you see. I forgot that part. 
 (GASPS) 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh, nothing. Er... Hello. 
 Why don't you go ahead and erm, I'll meet you at the café? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Please don't be angry. 
 I waited on the corner so I could catch you-- 
 I waited for you all night. 
 I got caught stealing the records. 
 I-I-I'm sorry. I... 
 I never meant for you to-- 
 It's fine. 
 I've spent my whole life behind those walls. 
 Must have been looking for a way out, anyway. 
 Does the Mother Abbess know that I was behind this? 
 Probably. 
 But what she doesn't know is that I remembered what I saw. 
 Your baby is in Paris, Nina. 
 The couple who adopted him, they live in the 8th Arrondissement. 
 Have you spoken to the father since we met? 
 Glad you got here first. 
 I just spoke to Marjorie. We're about to receive a very prestigious commission. 
 What's her name? 
 Don Juan. 
 How broad are her shoulders? 
 You have been asked to design the costumes for the next ballet at the Paris Opera, Monsieur Sabine. 
 You might wanna work on your reaction for when Marjorie brings it up. 
 Maybe learn how to smile when you sigh. 
 Helen, I'm not sure that now is the right time for me to take on a job like that. 
 Maybe not for you, but think about Claude. 
 It might be a nice way to smooth some ruffled feathers. 
 If he's inspired and busy with designing, then you can cater to clients. 
 Charlotte hasn't left yet. 
 She will be gone. It just can't happen overnight. 
 Clients rely on her. 
 Forgive my delay and my suit, but not necessarily in that order. 
 Uncle Edgar. 
 Are you alone? Where's Josephine? 
 Your aunt sends her regrets, trapped in meetings at the hospital, but you'll see her tonight at the concert. 
 All this glorious press you're getting, young man. 
 I don't know if I should shake your hand or curtsey. 
 You needn't do either. 
 All right. 
 Well, if I'd known that Tante Jo couldn't join us, we could've waited to have this conversation this evening. 
 Good news shouldn't wait. 
 So you found a doctor for Dominique? 
 The best. 
 Helen : Would she have to go there for the surgery? 
 That's where his team is. I've read that the Geneva Clinic is state of the art. 
 He's very much in demand. 
 But he is willing to take Dominique's case? 
 I spoke to him this morning and he's able to come to Paris on Friday for a consultation. 
 That's terrific. 
 Wonderful. We are so grateful, Uncle Edgar, and to Tante Jo, of course. 
 You know, you may not wish to raise the subject tonight. 
 No need to thank your aunt. 
 Why is that? 
 Well, we weren't in complete agreement about this choice. 
 What were her reservations? 
 Some dusty rumours about this Swiss doctor. 
 Who he may have operated on during the war. 
 High-ranking German officers and such. 
 They're just rumours. 
 Well, precisely. 
 You know your aunt. 
 She still can't forgive Mozart for being born in Austria. 
 (WRITING) 
 Just there. Can you see? 
 See how it pulls when I walk? 
 Or is that just the way I walk? 
 Don't answer that. 
 Maybe we can add to the panel in the back. 
 Over my dead body. 
 I've got enough bustle as it is. 
 Perhaps you could wear two girdles and hold your breath. 
 I did that at my first wedding. 
 Didn't have enough wind to say, "I do." 
 I just nodded and collapsed on the cellist. 
 Lucky for you it wasn't a tuba. 
 I was going to show the Marquise de Lithière that dress, but maybe this one is more her style, don't you agree? 
 I'm sorry, who are we talking about? 
 The Marquise de Lithière. You know her, don't you? 
 We became fast friends at Monsieur Trouvier's château this weekend. 
 Her sister is married to the Baron Roche-Ferois. 
 No, I never heard of him, or her for that matter but, then, I am lousy with titles. 
 We fought a war a long time ago so we wouldn't have to use them. 
 And if I'm not mistaken, we financed that war. 
 Charlotte, you must be feeling better. 
 Have you recovered from the weekend? 
 Much better, thank you, madame. 
 Maybe I should give the Marquise a few more choices. 
 She's eager to come here after our tea and fill her closet. 
 Is this today? Does the Marquise have an appointment? 
 Well, I-- 
 She doesn't need an appointment. 
 She has me. 
 Is that her, the woman who has him? 
 I don't know. 
 (RADIO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND) 
 Do you have a moment? 
 I bought this for Dominique. 
 A bed jacket. 
 I was hoping that maybe you could find something around here to add, to make it more special. 
 Change out the buttons or...? 
 Y-You know better than me. 
 I'll do my best. 
 Leave it there. 
 Well, if he's not there, I'll leave a message. Billy Novak wants to see him tonight. 
 Billy N-O-V-A-K. 
 Ten o'clock, Café Besan. 
 Tell him I have something significant to add to his story. 
 If we increase the volume down here, we could at least create the illusion of a waist. 
 Whose illusion? Is it yours or hers? 
 Cos she's not fooling anyone. She's shaped like a rolling pin. 
 I know, but Madame de Seis wants this dress. 
 So what can we do? 
 Nothing. 
 This dress wants a waist, which she doesn't have, so just get Charlotte to talk her into something else. 
 I'd rather find another solution. 
 Oh, I'm sure you will. 
 You don't give a rat's ass what I think, anyway. 
 That's not true. 
 Really? 
 Then why would you ask Juliette to execute a sh1t design that we agreed not to show? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You went into my drawer. You took the sketch without asking me. 
 The navy feuille. The ace of spades neckline. 
 Charlotte gave it to the girls at your request. 
 You know the dress. 
 I know the dress, yes, but I never requested-- 
 Oh, give it up, Paul. 
 Well, you may be able to fool Madame f*cking de Seis... but you're gonna have to work a lot harder with me. 
 Juliette : I'll meet you downstairs for the fitting. 
 Jeanette needs my help with a sleeve. 
 Did you take this from my brother's office? 
 What did you hope to prove by giving this to Juliette? 
 Is this your first attempt to humiliate me, or have there been others before this? 
 (SIGHS) Charlotte. 
 I don't want this to end badly. 
 It already has. 
 It doesn't have to. If you let me make you-- 
 What? 
 Send me to a perfume factory in another town? 
 I'm not a chess piece to be moved around at your will. 
 I didn't realise Monsieur Cassatt had already-- 
 He hasn't. 
 But Claude was thoughtful enough to let me know your intentions. 
 (SIGHS) 
 That was rash of me. I didn't think it through. 
 You're a big part of our success, Charlotte. 
 And you're right. You deserve everything you've earned. 
 I'd like to offer you a financial stake in the business. 
 A fair percentage that will allow you to leave here with dignity and a certain amount of freedom. 
 I don't think you can ask for more than that. 
 I'm not asking for anything, I have my own plan. 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 Hey, Nina. Hey, what happened? 
 Lunch, you never made it to the café. 
 Sorry. 
 My friend, she needed my help for something important. 
 Someone around here might need your help too, right? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Listen. 
 You told me something last weekend about Monsieur Sabine and now I need you to tell someone else. 
 Rossi is gonna print a hatchet job on him. 
 It could cause a lot of damage. 
 Have you told him about this article? 
 I can't. 
 OK, I'm thinking Rossi may have rushed it to print because of me. 
 I challenged him... Listen, it doesn't matter. 
 The fact is his story is one-sided and it's ugly and you told me that this man once saved you. 
 Right? Well, this could be your chance to return the favour. 
 How? 
 Talk to Rossi. 
 You let him know that Paul Sabine may have made those trips to Berlin and to Vienna in exchange for saving lives. 
 Once he hears your story-- 
 Why would he care about my story? 
 Nina, you're on the cover of a magazine. 
 You're becoming the face of-- 
 I can't do this right now. 
 He doesn't have a future if people won't forget his past. Nina, I don't know... 
 Is Juliette ready for me? 
 Yes, she is. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yes, yes. 
 Erm...Billy had an idea for some pictures. 
 Where's your camera? 
 He wanted to photograph me in the Metro and erm... I told him it's too dirty down there. 
 OK. 
 If you change your mind, Café Besan, ten o'clock tonight. 
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 Who is it? 
 May I speak with you? 
 What's this about? 
 An opportunity for both of us. 
 I found a wealthy banker who is looking to revive an old label. 
 It's practically dead. 
 They want fresh blood. 
 A new vision, someone who's well-connected to bring it back to life. 
 They've asked me to be that person. 
 Why? Why would anyone want to put new wine into old bottles? 
 Because those bottles carry meaningful provenance. 
 It's an established name, Claude. 
 But also a chance for a new designer to emerge. 
 Someone like you. 
 That will never happen if you stay here. 
 So it was you who pinched the sketch from my drawer. 
 How long are you willing to live in his shadow... let him take credit for your designs, your ideas, your brilliance? 
 You must want something more. 
 I know I do. 
 What's going on between you and my brother? 
 The weekend is behind me. I'm looking forward. 
 I've spent too many years dependent on other people to ensure my future. 
 No more. (EXHALES) 
 Your mother will try to convince you that I'm a liability, but she's wrong. 
 I've reinvented myself once and I can do it again. 
 You should be very careful about going through other people's drawers, Charlotte, cos you never know what you might find. 
 I didn't have to dig too deep. 
 (TRAIN WHISTLES) 
 Oh, may I? 
 Thank you. 
 You're still here? 
 First to arrive, last to leave. 
 Were you able to work on the gift for Dominique? 
 Afraid not. 
 There are seven orders to complete by Friday and you ask me to drop everything, for what? 
 For you to give a gift to her? 
 I just thought you wouldn't mind and-- 
 Did you? 
 Did you think? 
 There are ten girls who work in this building who could do it. 
 Why did you come to me? 
 B-Because you've offered to help me in the past. 
 Is that how you see me? 
 Someone who's here to tie a pretty bow on your gift to another girl? 
 But it's not a Valentine. 
 I should have been there when she stepped off that kerb and... 
 Forget it. 
 I'll ask someone else, then. 
 Don't touch it. 
 I'll do it in the morning. 
 
 
 
 (TRAIN RUMBLING) 
 (CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC) 
 I didn't even hear you come in. 
 I'm treading lightly, these days. 
 I nearly called the hospital, had you meet me at Garnier. 
 It's an early curtain. 
 How did she react? 
 To what? 
 To surgery in Geneva. 
 Did you offer to go with her? 
 We didn't discuss that. 
 Marjorie arrived... 
 (CHUCKLES) ...with enough flowers to decorate a race horse. 
 So you didn't mention the Swiss doctor at all? 
 Isn't he coming on Friday? 
 He doesn't have to make that trip. 
 I mean, there are doctors here who could take of Dominique. 
 I've done some research. 
 Besides, she needs a month to heal. 
 What research? Didn't Edgar already do that research? 
 This is not just about a modelling career, Paul. 
 This is a girl whose beauty has been her currency her entire life. 
 If she's disfigured-- 
 They only stitched her two days ago. 
 I think we can exercise some caution before we enlist the help of someone who could potentially damage the maison's reputation. 
 And who are we worried about offending? 
 Trouvier? 
 He's walked away from other designers because of German affiliations. 
 But he signed a contract with you. 
 And why suddenly are we letting muck-raking reporters scare us into making bad decisions? 
 If my uncle and his French wife, who smuggled Allied forces over the border, can get past-- 
 Your aunt was conveniently absent from that lunch. 
 My aunt doesn't have a relationship with Dominique. 
 You do. 
 Is she not the only person that you need to be thinking about right now? 
 If you are gonna change, we should-- 
 I can't join you tonight. 
 I have costume sketches to do for a ballet. 
 Isn't Claude working on them? 
 No. 
 I can't ask Claude. I have to do them. 
 And I'd better start since Charlotte is now intent on proving I'm a fraud. 
 What makes you say that? 
 Does she know? 
 I was the one who was hired by Frederic Lemair. 
 He wanted me. 
 My designs. My ideas. 
 I was there first. 
 I brought my brother into that shop and I lasted a hell of a lot longer than him. 
 Paul-- 
 I need to work. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Claude : Do you think she'll even look at these? 
 I don't see Dominique as much of a reader, but I thought she would at least get through a Tintin. 
 Finger. 
 Will you go with me? 
 I don't think so. 
 Oh, come on. You don't need to stay for long, just long enough to let her know we're thinking of her, if she cares. 
 She does. 
 Really? 
 Because when I was laid up there, she sent me a plant that looked carnivorous. 
 Probably hoped that it would devour what was left of me. 
 Claude? 
 Yeah? 
 Those months I went away... I wasn't with my aunt. 
 I spent them in a convent. 
 What? 
 Why would you do that? 
 Because... my mother insisted that I be somewhere safe... private. 
 So that no one would know I was having a baby. 
 Ours. 
 I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. 
 I couldn't. 
 I wanted to, when I first got back, but then you were hurt and... it was never the right time. 
 Erm... 
 Why would you tell me now? 
 Because I need your help. 
 (MELLOW JAZZ IN BACKGROUND) 
 Are you Billy? 
 Have we met? 
 Lucky guess. Have a seat. 
 Where's Rossi? 
 He's not in Paris. He sent me in his place. 
 I'm Simone Brusseau. 
 Monsieur Rossi and I work for the same newspaper and occasionally share my bed. 
 I think you met my aunt at Monsieur Trouvier's château. 
 The Contessa de Luciano. 
 So you're how he wrangled that invitation? 
 Shall we sit? 
 Mm. 
 So why did he leave Paris this time? 
 He went to Berlin, to convince a source to let him use his name for a story. 
 Same story he delivered to me? 
 Did you read it? 
 I did, but I didn't have to. 
 So how long have you known Monsieur Rossi? 
 For five years. 
 So you met during the war, in Paris? 
 You look surprised. 
 He's been stirring this pot for a long time. 
 There aren't too many Americans nowadays hungry to write stories about collaborators. 
 Justice doesn't have a nationality. 
 The man you were going after designs pretty dresses. 
 Seems like a strange target to me. 
 I thought you came here with something significant. 
 I did. 
 I don't think any story should be written until you have all the facts. 
 I'll stop talking when my friend arrives. 
 Your friend? 
 Look, I don't know Paul Sabine that well. 
 But I do know this: people are complicated. 
 They're capable of doing something cowardly at 9:00am, then something heroic an hour later. 
 Newspapers are black and white, but people come in all shades of grey, don't they? 
 Who is this person you've asked to join us? 
 She's the new face for Paul Sabine. 
 And you should hear what she has to say before you try him in a court of public opinion. 
 You may end up looking foolish. 
 What has your boss offered you to make you so loyal? 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 May I join you? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 This is Marianne Perrault... the premier d'atelier. 
 She's worked closely with Monsieur Sabine for... What? ...seven years now. 
 Ten. 
 Longer than anyone else there. 
 Holy f*ck! You scared me. 
 How is she? 
 She fell asleep five minutes after I got here. 
 It felt like my third honeymoon all over again. 
 I'm sure she was just honoured to have you here at all. 
 No, honey. Nobody should be in these places alone. 
 The last time I was, Charlotte never left my side. 
 Well, I'm betting this one is out for the night. 
 I saw a cute little spot just around the corner that might stock a vodka that won't strip off paint. 
 What do you say? 
 Er...no. No. I'm... I don't think so. I'm going to stay here tonight, I think. 
 She might wake up. 
 Who knew? 
 The little brother's a prince too. 
 Tell her I was here and... I don't know, I got evicted by a jealous nun and I shall stop by tomorrow. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) 
 How long have I been in here? 
 Erm...just a couple of days. 
 Since Saturday night. 
 You've been here the whole time? 
 No. No, I just... An hour or so. 
 I've brought you some books. 
 Why? 
 Not sure. 
 (SIGHS) My face itches. 
 Don't scratch it. 
 Why? Has most of it gone? 
 No. 
 No, I'm sure it's all still there. 
 (POURS WATER) 
 Your mother was right, you know. 
 Hm? 
 She read my cards before the show. 
 She saw this coming. 
 She told me that we don't get what we want, we get what we deserve. 
 You know it was me, right? 
 I burned the dress. 
 I shoved the light under the wedding gown. 
 Mm. 
 Your brother took that away from me. 
 He punished me... and took away what was mine. 
 Don't worry about that. 
 (DOMINIQUE SIGHS) 
 ♪ MOZART: Don Giovanni Monsieur Sabine has a gift for making us see something new in what's familiar. 
 Claude : The President's office is searching for a designer to dress the world. 
 Where do you think you'd be without him? 
 I wouldn't dare interrupt your legion of admirers. 
 Bravo! 
 You have raised it to a whole new level. 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 You devil. 
 Nobody else would have thought of that. 
 Timing makes the hero and this is Paul Sabine's time. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 No. No! 
 Why are you doing this? 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Leave me alone! 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC SWELLS) 
 Please. 
 (ECHOING SHOUTS) 
 (ECHOING SHOUTS) 
 No! Stop! 
 Monsieur? 
 (SIGHS) 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was just... 
 I left my keys in the darkroom. 
 Are you here alone? 
 I thought I was. 
 Look, if you want me to stick around, I've got a couple of minutes to-- 
 No. Er...no, don't. Go, please. 
 I can wait till Paul gets home. 
 Oh, God, no. 
 Don't be silly. (SNIFFLES) 
 I'll just take a couple of aspirin and climb into bed. 
 Stop diagnosing. 
 It's just a headache. Go get back to the restaurant or Tante Josephine and her friends will think you're using me as an excuse. 
 Maybe I am. What time will he get back? 
 Who, Paul? 
 I don't know. I'll be fast asleep. 
 Somehow I don't believe it. 
 You don't need to tell me, Helen, but I sense that something's not quite right between you two. 
 I picked it up at lunch. 
 I'm very sensitive as to how people tear their bread. 
 It's another diagnosis. 
 I took you in when you fled one bad situation and you know I would gladly do the same again. 
 I can't bear to see you unhappy. 
 Is there someone else in his life? 
 There was. It's over. 
 Well, as your grandmother used to say-- 
 I'm not walking away. 
 I can't. 
 Why? 
 Because, if it happens twice, you think everyone will be convinced there's something wrong with you? 
 Because he needs me. 
 Well, I hope he realises that before it's too late. 
 Don't sleep in your jewellery. You'll hurt yourself. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (THUNDER RUMBLES) 
 Marianne? 
 I er... 
 I just wanted to say thank you for showing up last night. 
 You know, it was never my intention to involve you in any of this. 
 I only asked Nina-- 
 I went there so Nina wouldn't have to. 
 Well, I'm sure Monsieur Sabine would be very grateful if he knew. 
 Now, I can't guarantee that they won't print that story-- 
 Let them print what they want. 
 At least the truth is out there. 
 It was time to speak. 
 Secrets can eat at your seams. 
 Still...it was brave. 
 Billy, I know you love her... but be patient. 
 She lost her ability to trust others a long time ago. 
 It may take a while for her to learn how to again. 
 Morning. 
 I changed out the buttons. 
 The new ones are sapphire enamel. 
 They'll look lovely with her eyes. 
 Thank you. 
 What is this? 
 My mother worked in a laundry when I was growing up. 
 She makes this herself. Heals your hands. 
 Don't ask me what's in it. 
 It-It smells like lavender, but it may involve chicken feed. 
 Please, just take it. 
 I love this. The cascading ribbons. 
 It's a nice touch. 
 Donna Elvira shedding her youth. Is that what you're going for? 
 No, actually. 
 I felt gutted by that point. The thought would be intestines. 
 Is this the Commander? 
 Did you ask Marianne to order more material for De Seis' dress? 
 Good morning, Claude. 
 Good morning, Helen. 
 Did you? 
 Was this after yesterday's conversation or before? 
 Which is it? 
 The client cannot wear that dress as designed. 
 It needs to be modified. 
 And who the hell are you to modify anything? 
 Is this because Eliette, whatever she wrote in her silly little rag, called you a prince, a merchant of happiness? 
 Cos you cannot even sew on a bloody button. 
 Claude-- 
 What? What? 
 Claude : You're nothing more than a salesman. 
 You are a hustler. You just flatter spoiled, insecure women and then you strut around here like a peacock when you are nothing more than a f*cking monkey! 
 Helen, would you excuse us, please? 
 Don't go! Don't go! 
 She knows the truth. 
 Actually, so do some of your prize staff, one of whom offered me a way out yesterday. 
 (GROANS) 
 A chance to get out of here before I am crushed by the wheels of your ambition. 
 Charlotte is not in a position to make anyone offers. 
 Why? 
 Cos they weren't sanctioned by you? 
 Stop it. She's using you to punish-- 
 I know exactly who's using me, Helen. 
 You're a little late to the party. 
 No, no. Wait! 
 What did she offer you? 
 A label that needs resuscitating. 
 And I'm eager to help... cos I've raised the dead before, haven't I? 
 Nina? 
 Have you spoken to Claude today? 
 Why? 
 The girls upstairs are whispering. 
 Juliette tells me that Charlotte's leaving to work for another house and Monsieur's brother's going with her. 
 Claude can't leave here. Who's going to design the...? 
 Where did he say he was going? 
 Paul, where is Claude? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't care. Let him go. 
 I am tired of appeasing and begging! 
 (SOFTLY) Lower your voice. 
 The stench of desperation is already seeping out through that door. 
 Your staff don't need to hear it too. 
 I'll bring your brother back. 
 You go downstairs and toss that conniving whore back into the sewer she crawled out of. 
 And shake out her bag too. 
 She's out to steal more than your brother. 
 I need to be alone right now. 
 You need him! 
 If you can't give these clients something extraordinary, the invitations will disappear. 
 They'll stop showing up. 
 You'll be stranded because, at the end of the day, you're a dressmaker. 
 You furnish supplies. 
 I know. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 This is Paul Sabine. 
 Good afternoon, Monsieur. 
 This is Inspector Bompard. How are you? 
 Very well, thank you, Inspector. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Well, I know you're a busy man. 
 But I wonder if you could spare me a few minutes tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow? 
 Yes, I'll be in Paris. 
 And I'd prefer to do this in person. 
 What's this regarding? 
 It'll be easier to explain once I'm there, monsieur. 
 I promise not to take up too much of your precious time. 
 May I look in my book and ring you back, Inspector? 
 Of course. I'll stand by for your call. 
 What did he want? 
 Paul? 
 Paul?
