 My friend sent me a p0rn link this morning. 
 Like, you know, my friend and I will send each other p0rn once in a while. 
 Just so, you know, if it's good, or if one of the guys looks like one of our dads or something fun, just... 
 You know, we're having a friendship. 
 I don't know, I've just never really been into p0rn. 
 I mean, the idea of people getting paid to have s*x, it's just... it's awful, it's never ever turned me on. 
 Totally, like, I hear you, but trust me this is-- 
 It's just different. 
 It's not like porny-porn, it's... 
 It feels like real s*x. 
 It just happens to be, literally, from the woman's point of view. 
 I'm curious, I guess. 
 Yeah. 
 (bed springs squeaking) (man groaning) 
 Oh... 
 (bed springs squeaking) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Oh... 
 (man grunting) 
 (man) Move down, move down. 
 Move down, move down. 
 (woman) Ow, you're on my hair. 
 Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 Did you ever see that movie, "Spanglish"? 
 What? 
 Call me Adam Sandler. 
 Can you-- can you-- 
 Move your-- bend your leg back more? 
 No. 
 Oh, all right, sorry. 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Ohh! 
 Oh... 
 (exhaling) 
 Oh... oh... 
 Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. 
 Okay. 
 (man)  Can I get a $75 bid now? 
 At $75... Did you show me this so I would think guys were gross and I would lez-out with you? It worked. ♪ Do you think there's, like, a p0rn they can make for women that would be more appealing? Bottomless guys vacuuming, I don't know. 'Cause they're cleaning up. Trashy p0rn is so gross. I thought you were gonna say "trapeze" but I'm glad you said "trashy." I generally don't watch p0rn. You liar. (horn honking) No one believed you. That car is honking at what a liar you are. ♪ I had an encounter with a huge (bleep) this past year. (woman cheering) Are you excited about it? 'Cause I wasn't, it was... A huge pen1s, I think it's like a unicorn. Like in theory, you're like, "Yes! I would love to see a unicorn up close, yes." But if a unicorn was actually standing in front of you, you'd be like, "(bleep) that." You would run. You'd run, you'd be like, "Oh, it's just a horse with a weapon on its head." Which is what a giant pen1s is. The only difference is, unicorns are white. Who in here has had an encounter with a mind-blowingly huge pen1s? Oh my God, wait, you should see how sad all the guys look right now, just... A sea of sad faces. Like you, you're like, "Meredith, I believe she asked a question, um..." Making her clap. She's like, "I heard her." Yeah, I think big penises, they're just, like, superfluous. It's like a Hummer limo. You know, they look cool, but if you can't park it anywhere, what's the point? ♪

He kind of presents his pen1s. Like, he's like, here it is. And I think he thought because I'm like a substantial gal that I'd be like, "That old thing?" But I was like, "Mom!" It didn't even register as a (bleep). Like, it just looked like an animal had latched on. Like, wouldn't let go. We should call someone. Where does that sleep at night?

I should've been taking Instagram pics with it, like, huh... Unh-unh, like fun, possible... holiday photos, right? I was, like, getting myself psyched. I'm like, "Come on, bitch. "You played volleyball in high school. "You did that 5K Run/Walk once. You... can do this." And he was getting weirded out 'cause I was saying all this out loud. I was like, who am I kidding? I'm gonna sleep with this guy. What am I, a war hero? So... so I was like, "Do you have a condom?" And he was like, "No." And I was like... "Way to call me on my bluff. You know I don't care."

I never do this but... I love your hair. Oh, really, no. I think it's the most amazing hairdo I've ever seen in my life. What would you even call a shape like that? Oh, I... a circle? Okay, yeah, yeah, I see that now. A hair circle. Huh, well... I guess I love hair circles, who knew? Life is so full of lessons and surprises. Do you wanna grab coffee or something? Uh, yes, yes, I would. Okay. Great. I'm Amy. Oh, it's nice to meet you. I can't believe you like my perm. I was really mad about it. ♪ Oh, wow, cool dog. Is that a permanent dog? What? Come here.

Like, I'm not trying to make it sound like I have some dainty tea-drinking v*g1n*. Just like this-- just thimble of a "Downton Abbey" watching... summering in the vineyard (bleep). Like, no.
