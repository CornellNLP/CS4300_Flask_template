 Hey! 
 You're home early. 
 They let us out of work 'cause there was a shooting. 
 Why are you all sweaty? 
 I was just-- I was working out. 
 Yeah, is there something you wanna tell me? 
 You're beautiful. 
 Anything else, anything... on your mind? 
 Nope, no, why? 
 Because what are these, Kevin? 
 (bells jingling) 
 I don't know, what are those? 
 They look like clown panties. 
 Why are there clown panties crumpled up in our hallway? 
 Are those not yours? 
 No, they're not mine. 
 Do they look like the hypoallergenic brand my doctor recommended? 
 No! 
 They look like they belong to a clown. 
 A slut, whore clown! (bells jingling) 
 Okay, you know, I-- I think I know what that is. 
 I did our laundry at that new Laundromat up the street, Big Top Laundry. 
 A lot of local clowns go there, so... 
 Hey, I'm glad I worked this out, huh? 
 No. 
 Uh, who's Sparkles? 
 Hmm? 
 Sparkles? 
 I went through your phone last night. 
 Here, let's take a look. 
 "You up?" 
 "I need you." 
 "Honk-honk." 
 That's the type of (bleep) you text to a clown! 
 Oh! 
 You are (bleep)! 
 Oh, my God, I was just texting a friend from work! 
 I can't believe you took my phone! 
 You work with someone at Deloitte & Touche named Sparkles? 
 Yes, Sparkles Biederman! 
 He's been there for years. 
 He's Dutch. 
 "Your ass is tighter than a balloon giraffe." 
 You text that to a man you work with at a financial consulting firm? 
 It's industry jargon. 
 It's not in your wheelhouse. 
 You know what, this is stupid. 
 Let's just look at the security footage from last night. 
 How about that? 
 Oh, my God! 
 You are being so crazy right now! 
 (laughing) 
 What the (bleep) is that, Kevin? 
 (bells jingling) 
 (laughing) 
 Okay. 
 You got me. 
 It was supposed to be a surprise for our anniversary. 
 Our anniversary? 
 It's tomorrow. 
 You forgot, didn't you? 
 Oh, my God. 
 I totally forgot. 
 I'm such a stupid dumb bitch. 
 I know how you like balloon animals so I paid these clowns to... fill your closet up with them. 
 (sighing) 
 Surprise. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Why do you put up with me? 
 Because you're hot. 
 (whispering) Thank God. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I just-- I get so scared of losing you. 
 I know, I know, I know, I know. (bells jingling) 
 I know, I know. 
 Women-- we're lucky, aren't we? 
 'Cause, women, we can have multiple orgasms-- I've read. 
 (crowd laughing) 
 And I swear, that's not me trashing guys. 
 Like, it's not easy to give me an orgasm. 
 It's not fun. 
 It's... I have to have the focus of an Olympic hopeful on a balance beam. 
 (breathing heavily) 
 And I get distracted. 
 If the temperature changes, I'm like, "I lost it, I lost it". 
 But women, like, sometimes we have to fake orgasms, right? 
 And that's not us being disrespectful to men. 
 That's just-- that's our way of saying to you, you know... "Wrap it up." 
 Right? 
 That's your Oscar play-off, end-your-speech music. 
 We're saying, "I love you. 
 "I'm glad we did this. 
 "But ' Storage Wars ' is on in a minute. 
 Get out of me." 
 ♪ 
 (woman) Thank you so much for doing this. 
 Oh, no, it's an honor. 
 I can't believe I'm someone's Make-A-Wish. 
 His name's Jason. 
 He's nine, he's gonna die, like, yesterday. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You'll be fine. 
 (monitor beeping) 
 Hi, hi! 
 Hi, hi. 
 Welcome. 
 He's, uh, right over there. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, Jason, I'm Amy. 
 Um, I brought this for you. 
 Oh... 
 Your headshot. 
 Okay. 
 Uh... I just want you to know that you're-- you're really special and, um... and everything's gonna be fine. 
 (monitor beeping) 
 Well, I'm realizing that I bit off a little bit more than I could chew. 
 It was an honor meeting you. 
 Oh, whoa, where-- where do you think you're going? 
 I was gonna go get my car. 
 Don't you know why you're here? 
 I thought I was just supposed to come and meet-- meet Jason. 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 Roast me. 
 Roast you? 
 It was our son's last wish to be roasted by a professional comedian. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I don't feel comfortable making fun of your son. 
 You think I give a bitch queef what you are comfortable with?! 
 Okay. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Okay. 
 Um... 
 Nice bed-- 
 Why don't you get some more tubes in your nose, weirdo? 
 (nervously chuckling) Is that even a joke? 
 Okay, uh... 
 Where's the rest of your hair? 
 Is it, uh, at the hair parade... 
 Oh, God. 
 ...where there's no hair? 
 Enough with the softballs, please. 
 Okay. 
 This is really hard. 
 Hey-hey, hey, little man. 
 Hi. 
 How ya feelin'? 
 Terrible. 
 Well, at least you feel the way you look. 
 (laughing) 
 Am I right, am I right? 
 Nah, I'm just jokin', I'm just jokin'. 
 You're dark and handsome. 
 If it's dark... you're handsome. 
 (laughing) 
 Okay, I gotta go, I gotta go. 
 (whispering) That's good. 
 (laughing) 
 LOL. 
 (man) Oh, he's good. 
 Amy, take notes. 
 Those-- those were hack one-liners from the Internet. 
 What? 
 The Internet. 
 You know, the thing you won't be on in three weeks. 
 Wow, Amy. Hey. 
 That's not the direction we're going in? 
 No. 
 Listen... 
 He's ready for a laugh but, y'know, could you please make sure it's funny? 
 Yeah, put some kind of twist on it. 
 Has he been there the whole time? 
 (woman) Knock, knock. 
 (Jason) Lisa Lampanelli! 
 My first choice. 
 It would either be me or the Grim Reaper. 
 (laughing) 
 That's good. 
 We heard that you booked a Toyota commercial. 
 You weren't available, I... 
 Well, that explains why Amy Schumer's here. 
 The girl's a miracle worker with her comedy. 
 If she's funny, it's a miracle. 
 (all laughing) 
 (man) That's terrific. 
 Beat it! 
 (man) Yeah, beat it. 
 Hey, wait a minute. 
 Who's dying here first? 
 This guy... or this guy?

 Yeah. 
 You have HPV. 
 We've been trying to reach you for seven years. 
 I know. 
 ♪ 
 If you could have one wish, what would it be? 
 You're granted one wish. 
 Uh... 
 Is it for a sea of drunken, aging horny Irish men to come up behind you? 
 (stammering) 
 Yup. 
 Yup. 
 Well, today's your lucky day! 
 If you had one wish, what would it be? 
 I would like Green Lantern's powers. 
 What could he do? 
 Anything he imagines, he can project out his ring. 
 Oh, okay. 
 I thought he just, like, could marry Blake Lively and have a movie nobody saw. 
 ♪ 
♪ 
 (Amy) Thank you for coming over. 
 I've never seen him this depressed. 
 You know, I think it hits men especially hard when they're unemployed. 
 Yeah, but even worse than that is the new therapy that he's on. 
 Hey, Mark. 
 Oh, hey, Colleen. 
 You need help, you want me to get you something? 
 No, I don't need help, I'm not five. 
 Where's my lucky glass? 
 It's next to the books. 
 I'm at the books. 
 I see it right in front of you. 
 Oh, I got it, it was at the books. 
 Why is he skipping? 
 That's the therapy. 
 The doctor told him to skip as a way to trick himself into feeling happier. 
 Yeah, you know, I think I saw something about this on that show "The Doctors." 
 I only saw a little bit because the show's unwatchable. 
 Hey, babe, I'm sorry I, like, was curt with you, but I'm feeling a little better. 
 I think this is starting to work. 
 I'm starting to, like, feel it. 
 Great, that's great, babe. 
 Hey, I'm gonna go upstairs and watch some of my karate movies. 
 Okay. 
 Bye, Colleen.

 Ho-ho, he got it. 
 Whoo! 
 Close. 
 That guy's got my number today, huh? 
 Yeah. Why don't you try running?

 He's fast like a cheetah. 
 Babe, babe! 
 I'll get that later. 
 ♪ 
 No, no, no, no, no, let me... 
 Yes. 
 Nothing's too good for my princess. 
 Now you eat up. 
 (whispering) Stop skipping. 
 Babe, I feel, like, lately things have been a little off with us. 
 Mainly you. 
 Mainly  me . 
 So I, um, talked to my psychiatrist and he wrote you this prescription. 
 Don't be mad. 
 The Electric Slide? 
 ♪ You can do it ♪ 
 Look, are you gonna stop skipping anytime soon? 
 I don't know. 
 Are you ever gonna try The Electric Slide? 
 No. 
 Why can't you be happy for me? 
 Look, I don't think I can do this any more.

 I love you so much. 
 I love you too.

 I'm sorry to interrupt, folks. 
 That was the bravest goddamn thing I have ever seen in my goddamn life.

 Um... kind of everything, but... (laughing)

 Are you talking to me right now?

♪ 
 I haven't done anything I'm supposed to do as a 30-year-old. 
 Like, I was the last one to know that it wasn't cool to drink like a homeless person anymore. 
 (crowd laughing) 
 'Cause when you're younger, that's how you drink. 
 You drink, like, 40s in paper bags at bus stops. 
 (crowd cheering) 
 Right? 
 Some people still do it. 
 You run from the cops, you pee behind dumpsters. 
 I remember more than once being like, "I just found these beers in the bushes. 
 Let's drink 'em!" 
 And no one was like, "Ew, you're a vagrant." 
 They were like, "We're gonna remember tonight forever!" 
 Uh... 
 It's just gross. 
 In your 20s, if you black out from drinking, you're fun. 
 You're a fun girl, right?

 That's what happens.

 But addiction can come into anyone's life at anytime. 
 This is a dramatic reenactment of my story. (woman) It's so weird. I'm, like, a different size at every store. At Zara, I'm a beast. At J. Crew, I'm like a supermodel. Yeah, I'm a nine across the board. Like, it doesn't matter where I go. I was used to my friends ignoring me and getting my name wrong most of the time.
