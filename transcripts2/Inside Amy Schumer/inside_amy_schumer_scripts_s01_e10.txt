 (Heavy panting) 
 Well, that was fun. 
 Amy, you all right? 
 I don't know. 
 What's up? 
 I think I just thought that I would be more like the focal point? 
 Huh. 
 Were you not the focal point? 
 No, no, definitely not. 
 Like, I just-- it never even occurred to me that you would be penetrating Phil. 
 Did I do that? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes, yes. 
 I thought you felt comfortable with Phil. 
 I do. I usually do. 
 Phil... 
 Look, you've been our pharmacist, how long, three years, okay? 
 We move closer to another CVS. 
 I said, "Let's stick with Phil", didn't I, okay? 
 She did. 
 Maybe I'm being over sensitive but God, I don't think so, I don't think so. 
 What's the problem, Amy? 
 I had an orgasm, probably the biggest one I've ever had in my life. 
 You Phil? 
 I didn't. 
 I didn't even come close. 
 Nobody touched me. 
 I went to the bathroom at one point. 
 You guys didn't even realize... 
 No, it's too late, Phil. 
 I just wish you hadn't been yelling, "This feels so right." 
 Okay, how do you know I wasn't talking about you? 
 This feels so right with you, Phil! 
 Phil, Phil, Phil! 
 I'm penetrating Phil! I'll tell you something. Men are not good at planning. Can we just agree on that? I've learned that. They are not good at planning unless... it's for a threesome, right? Then they become (bleep) event planners. I'm like, why are you wearing a headset and holding a clipboard, um... Is that the "Braveheart" soundtrack? ♪ Dylan, great job on the "30 Ways to Know You're 20 Pounds Overweight" article. I heard most girls were crying by number seven. All right, next order of shizz, We're still 80 tips away from being done with 500 hottest s*x tips. Start pitching. What if, while you're going down on him you take a feather and you gently tickle the space behind his balls? Hunter, it's s*x tips to drive him wild, not drive him mild. (laughing) That's hilarious, did you guys hear what I said? (all laughing) Okay, write that down. Actually, just put it right on the blog. I don't want people to have to wait for that. Okay, Lenore, go. So you dress like a Boy Scout but only from the bottom down and then you sit on his knee and queef. Interesting, I like it... more. Take a five-hour energy and pour it inside your v*g1n* right before you have s*x. Where's your office? I'm moving it closer to mine. Spin me around. What if you take a pumice stone and you hold it over an open flame for like an hour and then you gently grate it up and down his shaft? Wow, love it. Okay, guys, we need 75 more and don't be lazy. So far, the pumice stone's my favorite. You put his pen1s in a glory hole. You begin to stroke it. You take a mouthful of (bleep) from his three best friends and then you shoot it in his face until he explodes? Hmm... What about a sawed-off shotgun? You could take it and rub it up and down his neck till he's super hard. Okay. Okay. Okay. Bridgett. You look like a sad emoticon. Give me something. Okay, okay, how 'bout this. You fall in love with a stockbroker, you know because it really seems like he wants to get married. And then you're together at the Chipotle and his friends from work show up, and he pretends like you're bussin' the table. So what do you do? You pick up his basket, you clear his table. You wipe it and you say, "Can I get you anything else?" And you know what he says? He says, "Yeah, could you freshen our drinks?" So you freshen everybody's drinks. And you go back into the kitchen. You take somebody's card, you clock out, you go home and then what do you do? You pour yourself a bottle of Chardonnay and you sit on the toilet and then you start playing Words With Friends with Lenore. And then you just go and you get into bed... And then he explodes. What's happening over here? What's happening in this section? Bridgett is going through a breakup. You don't know what I'm going through. Okay, she's a ticking time bomb. Somebody top her off. I'm not hearing s*x tips. What, are we hanging out-- are you guys my friends? No. So you wait till he finds out his dad's been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Then, while he's crying, you put one finger-- two fingers up his butt... until he explodes? I have one. Make eye contact? You're a (bleep), fan me. How' bout, go to Trader Joe's, and buy an Amy's frozen Indian dinner. Then smear it all over his genitals in slow circles clockwise... and then counter clockwise. I tried that... and it works. Okay. You're fired. That eye contact thing was ridic-- get out. Guys, this article is gonna cause a baby boom. We're doing God's work. ♪ 2,000 men are suing "Glamo" Magazine for emotional damages claiming their s*x tips are at least partially responsible for the fact that they were bizarrely raped by their girlfriends. (anchorman) We spoke to one of the plaintiffs. I came here today because I don't want anyone to ever have to go through what I went through. I bet you guys didn't know that you can, uh, fit a Hanukkah candle in your pee-hole. Well, guess what "Glamo" Magazine, you can't. Now I have to piss in a bag. ♪ What's your best s*x tip? I'm Taurus so I'm kind of a sensual lover so I'm, you know... I'm very passionate. Did you guys just hear that? My underwear just fell off. Do you have any good s*x tips? Biting. Biting is good. Are you sure? Yeah. G-Spot, very important. Poke the fingers. You gotta work the G-Spot. Like "come over here..." It's important, yes. I'll take the check but I first wanna order something else first. There are a lot of workshops you can take so... I know, but I'm so lazy. Yeah. What's your best s*x tip? I'd say flick your tongue very quickly. If he's uncut and the skin covers the tip of the pen1s when he withdraws the pen1s, he becomes very sensitive so... (laughing) ♪ 
♪ You know, men fake orgasms, did you know that? Did you know that? Probably not with you, you gorgeous... sunflower. But with this tulip, I'm sure everyone (bleep) you to completion, but this... this petunia... A guy faking an orgasm-- it's so funny. I was dating this guy and, uh, we were in New Orleans and we were wasted. We were having s*x and it was disgusting. It was just like two seals batting at each other's... Eh, just drunken hams high-fiving. It was awful, and uh... And he was obviously done with our shared experience 'cause he faked an orgasm. And like, men, you're not allowed to fake it. You're not allowed. There's hard evidence if it doesn't happen. I'm like, "Oh, do you (bleep) magic now?" Wow, where is it? You can't-- especially if it's your girlfriend. Like, we know with the noises you make. We don't know the faces you make, because that's something you look at once by accident. It's like looking into the sun. You're like, "Ow, never again." That was a one-time kind of mistake. But we do, we know your noises. So this guy, we're having gross s*x, and he lets out this fake weird noise he's never made before, like... "Bleuh..." I'm like, "Is your dick haunted all of a sudden, that's amazing." ♪ Welcome to "How Will This Relationship End." The dating game show where two sexual women guess how their relationship with three eligible bachelors might end. Let's meet our contestants. Amy, tell us a little bit about yourself. Okay, um, well, I'm a-- I'm 31 years old. I'm from Columbus, Ohio. And I enjoy repeating the same mistakes over and over again and never growing. Fun. Larissa, I understand you're from Indiana? That's right and romantically, I do have a type and that's anyone who reminds me of my dad. Ho-ho, Papa, can you hear me? (laughing) Okay, let's play. Here's our first bachelor. Hi, my name's Brent. I'm an accountant from Atlanta. So Amy, how do you see this relationship ending? Okay, uh, we'll go on three terrible dates and, uh, he'll make me order appetizers as entrees and even though I'm mildly disgusted by him it'll bother me that I never hear from him again. I could believe that. Larissa. Uh, I think we'd probably go out for about two months. And then I would discover that he writes movie reviews for a white supremacist website. Let's see what Brent has to say. My favorite movie was "Lincoln". I thought Daniel Day-Lewis was incredible as that war criminal. Perfect ending. Larissa, you're on the board. Whoo! Let's meet our next bachelor. Hey, my name is Ryan. I'm from the Bronx and I work at Fill-a-Bear. A lot of people mishear that as Build-a-Bear. But Fill-a-Bear is different. See I empty out old Teddy Bears and then I sell the carcasses to Build-a-Bear. Larissa. Well, first of all, I will fall in love with Brent because he looks like my dad, uh, which will cause me to turn into a hoarder like my mother... Ten seconds Larissa. Oh, uh, and then, uh, we'll have a huge fight one day when he throws out one of my treasures, an umbrella that says Advil on it and then he walks out of my life forever and I call my dad... (buzzer) Amy. Okay, after dating for about six months I accidentally get pregnant and even though we're not really together anymore he won't let me get an abortion? (bell dinging) Good answer. Well, let's see what Ryan has to say. I would never pay child support. But I'm strongly pro-life. Don't argue with me 'cause I'm not smart enough to defend my position. Yankees rule. Amy, you nailed it. Nice. Let's check out our final bachelor. I work at the Apple Genius Bar. Amy, how do you see this ending? Okay, um, I think I've got this one, Tom. We'll date for about eight months and then I'll open a folder on his desktop labeled football stuff and find 400 photos of Daniel Radcliffe. (bell dinging) Amy, I'm gonna stop you right there. You're absolutely right. Yes, yes, yes. It's happened a lot. I'm gay. Congratulations, Amy, you win. Nice! Join us next week for another episode of "How..." Hey, dad, it's me. Well, I lost just like you said I would. Yeah, I can call you back later.

My brothers went around school and they got everybody to call me little nippy-titty, little nippy-titty, little nippy-titty, little nippy-titty. My mom said, "What's wrong?" I said, "Nothing."
