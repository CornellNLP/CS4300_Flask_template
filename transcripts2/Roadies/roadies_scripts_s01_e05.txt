 Bill :  Previously on  Roadies... 
 So are you two, uh, married? 
 No. 
 No. 
 You two are in denial... about a lot of things. 
 You think just 'cause Sean is on retainer with Taylor Swift, I'm sitting in a tub of butter? 
 Times like these, I used to like a little drink. 
 We're gonna open with "Janine" tonight. 
 Time to shake things up. 
 I mean, I was there when they first saw each other that night, Chris and Janine. 
 How can you say it was cursed? 
 Janine broke his heart. 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 Why do you think he came on the bus in the first place? 
 I don't know if you were coming to see a specific person, say, me, but if you were, it... it just kind of puts me in an awkward position. 
 I don't feel things in the way that other people do. 
 Natalie, you know you got a restraining order out on you, right? 
 God, Kelly Ann, you're such a buzzkill sometimes. 
 You know that? 
 Shelli, is Rick okay? 
 Bill :  Back when I was partaking, Rick and I,  we... we used to party pretty hard together. 
 Rick's gone. 
 What? 
 Rick the bass player's missing? 
 Oh, thank God you're okay. 
 You guys sh1tting me? 
 Hey. 
 Rick and I have been traveling a path. 
 Great restraining order. 
 It's really a big help. 
 And how long has it been since you've last had s*x? 
 Tina :  Seven days. 
 Oh, poor you. 
 So if I don't have s*x in the next two days, what happens? 
 First comes the fever. Check. Then the intense feelings of severe disconnection. Check. After that, flesh erosion. Hmm. Tina, this plague is real. I urge you to have s*x as soon as possible, to save your life. Tina :  Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, Doctor. [crowd cheers in distance] [phone line trilling] [voicemail beeps] Mmm. It's me again. Uh, as I may have mentioned 18 or 20 times, we're in Denver tomorrow, and 275 miles is the closest we've been since you returned from space, so are you sure Taylor won't let you out for one day? Call me back. Okay, babe? I'm feeling kind of... [soft chuckle] disconnected. Also, my sister's coming, and it would be a huge help if you were here. [crowd cheering] Tom : Good night, Omaha. [sighs] There she is. They want to play an extra encore tonight. Ugh! What's with all the new songs? I mean, why can't we just keep the f*cking set list as it always was? But, no! We have to get inspired. You okay? [upbeat electronic music] ♪ ♪ Must be the moon. ♪ ♪ [grunts] It's a brown leather Fendi suit... Oh, well, thank God. Okay, yeah. I'll be in Denver tomorrow. Send it there. Thank you. You found the Fendi? Well, fingers crossed. Yeah. Kelly Ann? Yeah? Next time your boyfriend works a package deal with a hotel, ask him to get us free Internet. Uh, he's not my boyfriend. Just ask him to reimburse us. Harvey says write it off on our taxes, which is bullshit. Yeah! [laughs] Yeah, it is, but he's not my... sh1t. Love Omaha. Great show. [toilet flushes] Uh-oh. The concerned look. No. Now the clasped hands. Whatever it is you're about to tell me, is it gonna bum me out? Well, it depends if we want to listen to our Hawaiian security guard. He's, uh, he's seen some kind of darkness coming this way for weeks. I believe everything Puna says. I'm wondering if we should keep playing "Janine." Why? Because she called. Janine called? Yeah, and I talked to her. Uh, she lives in Boulder now. Still a nurse. Works in an emergency room, and she was, um, you know, hinting about wanting to see a show. So you start playing the song for the first time in seven years, and she calls ya up. What exactly did she say? Uh..."Hi. This is a ghost from your past." I just wanna ask you, Christopher, if she comes to the show in Denver, you know, uh, do you want to see her? [softly fingerpicks guitar] Do you remember that winter she left me? And she was so calm when she ended it. She said she had no problem being number two to my need for self-loathing and success, but to be number three to my need to drink and drug over Denny, that she couldn't stick around to watch. And then she finished her grapefruit juice, put down that red plastic cup on the kitchen counter, and walked out the door. Right. The red Solo cup, that was always up on your counter. I kept that cup for years. Yeah. And then one day I just threw it away. I don't need to see her, and she's better off not seeing us. Well, we can't keep her from buying a ticket. Denver's not sold-out? No, no, it... it... it is, okay? Both shows. I'm just saying, like, anybody can go on StubHub. Well... leave her a ticket just in case she shows up, but... no backstage. Got it. That seems perfect. Hey, I should wear the Gram Parsons' Nudie jacket to the Denver shows, don't you think? It's still in your storage unit, right? Yeah. I mean, my storage unit's just my old garage, but, yes, I have it. Oh, sh1t. Never mind, man. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. It's fine. I mean, you okay seeing Lorraine again? It's not a problem. You okay? Yeah. All right, this will be fine. Yeah. Catch you later. I'm gonna get us some steaks. [bluesy rock music] ♪ Was a cold wind blowing ♪

♪ Sweet William back in town ♪ You didn't happen to hear about this supermoon, did you? It actually affects things here on Earth. I read about it this morning on Yahoo. They say that people actually feel a gravitational pull... [scoffs] Hmm. towards honesty. Hmm. Eh, you're just waiting for me to stop talking, right? Yes. Okay. Here's what we got, okay? Christopher's family want their own rooms because they heard that Tom's stepsister was getting her own, which she's not. [sighs] Okay. What? Uh, I told Christopher about Janine. [knock at door] You did? Hey, guys. Hey, Milo. What's up? You didn't mention an opener for tonight's show, right? Just want to throw this out there. My band, Black Atlantis, totally willing to jump in and just tear the roof off this f*cking house. What do you think? Um... Actually, great. I almost forgot about this. We got Lucius. Timing was perfect. They're in between tours. They love the band. Got Lucius lined up. [grunting] God! Lucius! f*cking... That's amazing. Pretty good, right? f*cking, yeah, it's amazing. Ha. Oh, yeah. I'll go tell everyone. Okay, thanks, Milo. Cool. Yeah, you got it. Shut that on your way out. Milo : Good decision, Bill. Yeah, so he asked me to get Janine a ticket. Mm-hmm. No backstage. Right. And would you mind helping me out on this? I'd do it myself, it's just I've gotta run out. Ru... run out? Yeah, uh, Christopher asked me to get his Nudie jacket out of storage. He wants to wear it tonight. Uh, I see. Well, I-I-I can send someone. Uh, that's okay. It's too valuable. You know that Gram Parsons virtually created country rock when he inspired the Rolling Stones to record "Wild Horses" in 1971? Without the man that wore that jacket, the jacket that I'm going to get, you got no Eagles, no Kenny Chesney, no Tim McGraw. And country? Country stays traditional, and Taylor Swift is working at Tom's instead of being out in space. [mouthing] Yeah? Yeah. Why... why are you giving me that look? It's like you don't trust me loose in my own hometown. No, don't... no, don't... You gotta relax. Don't be ridiculous. I... Come on. It's not even gonna take me that long. I'm gonna be back before you know it. You... you know what? No. It... you should just take as long as you need. I'm not worried about Sweet William, in Denver, seeing Lorraine. In... in fact, uh, gr-grab one of the runner vans. Yeah? Yeah. See you when I get back. Okay. All right, then. ♪ Like the prodigal son... ♪ [door closes] [sighs] All right. Hey, Milo. Hey. I heard they added eight new songs. I hope Rick can pull it off. Yeah, honestly, I-I-I want to say hi to you, but I can't. That makes sense. Why don't you stab my f*cking eyes out and blind me so I no longer have to witness this goddamn travesty? He just found out about you and Reg hooking up. What? No. What? f*ck! It's cool. I get it. He's English. He's like this forbidden fruit. Like a pale, bland... is a potato a fruit? Wait, people actually think that I'm with Reg? Well, you did steal eggs together. Yeah, it was vol... not voluntarily. And you started wearing perfume. I felt like smelling better. And there was that one picture of Reg on your Instagram. But that was a group shot that he photobombed. I find it incredibly sexist that people think I'm making love to him in his spin-centric socks. If I stop wearing f*cking perfume, will people think we've broken up? See, the fact that you've formed an opinion about his socks... Oh, Jesus! By the way, is he circumcised or does he have that extra flap of skin that you have to peel back? You know who's spreading this sh1t is you. Because everybody knows you can't keep a secret, even a fabricated one. Anyway. The truth will come out because it's the supermoon. Shelli : There is no f*cking air up here! man :  Shelli? Ugh! Go for Shelli. Avoid her today. Sean's not coming, and homegirl really needs to get laid. Okay. man :  Camera one good to go. Yeah, yeah. Shelli? Yeah? I've been assigned to help you with the friends and family guest list, plus anything else you may need. Nice. I-I mean, hi. Bill : Morning. Uh, follow me. Bill : Morning, morning. It's a ritual we do anytime we get into a new venue. Bill : Okay. Ahem! Denver, Colorado. [chuckles] The Mile-High Ciudad. Hometown of the SHB. Lord knows I got into more than my fair share of trouble around these parts. I did. [chuckles] [clears throat] Anyhow, for many of you, this, uh, return to the scene of the crime will be a nonstop grind filled with friends and family who, unfortunately, you have to see again because you were weak and you friended 'em months earlier on Facebook, not knowing their true motives, tickets. [laughter] Right? Anyhow, Led Zeppelin made their North American debut right here, the day after Christmas, 1968. I'm talking early Led Zeppelin. I'm talking explosive, hungry, Robert "Percy" Plant Led Zeppelin. Managed by tough, loyal, unforgiving Peter Grant, "We're not leaving America until you know who we are" Led Zeppelin. I'm talking "Train Kept A-Rollin'" in a basement rehearsal room Led Zeppelin. I'm talking John Henry Bonham at the kit, John Paul Jones and James Patrick Page on these boards right here Led Zeppelin! That's the Led Zeppelin that I'm talking about! man :  On bass, we got John Paul Jones. [crowd cheering] If you've ever been to the redwoods, you can see it. man :  On the drums, John Bonham. If you've been to the Colosseum in Rome, you can feel it. man :  Lead guitar, Jimmy Page. And when you're standing right here, if you're quiet... man :  Vocals, Robert Plant. You can still hear it. man :  Please welcome Led Zeppelin. All right, one last bit of high-altitude clarity for you people. This is only day one of our pain-in-the-ass hometown doubleheader, so pace yourselves. Breathe, if possible. Stevie The Rock Doc is on hand with B12 shots, if anybody needs one. And, uh, don't forget to look up in the sky tonight. It's the supermoon. That only happens once every 37 years. All right? So here we go. Hometown number one. Let's do it. Denver, Colorado. all : Yeah-oh! [applause] Shelli : Kelly Ann? Oh, sh1t. Reg : Bill! Oh, sh1t. Yeah? I am off to fetch Mike Finger. Whoa, wait a second! What? You're doing... Well, he's the band's Internet archivist, the curator and founder of the almost frighteningly comprehensive fan site The Blue and The Black. Finger holds the key to our box set. Oh! What does he look like? It... I can't seem to find a picture of him anywhere. Yeah, no, I know that he's been running our fan site for years, and no one's ever met him or seen a picture of him. Hmm. That's odd. Obviously he doesn't get out much. I'm guessing, uh, translucent skin, bad posture, stained shirt from the early '90s, Howard Hughes fingernails, and I'd bring breath mints. And not for you. Reg, hey, just... I gotta tell you. I have a bad feeling about you bringing Mike Finger here. Bill, don't be ridiculous. I am evangelizing the core. "Evangelizing the core"? Shelli : Kelly Ann? I need you to take photos at the VIP meet-and-greet. We're doing VIP packages now? Uh, yes, we are, thanks to your "anything for a buck bloke." Wes! Yes? Satan's spawn... I mean, uh, Staton's spawn, is going to spend the day with his godparents, God bless them. Yeah, I know, I know. But I'm here for you. Me too. Well, thanks. Thank you. I'm here for you too. Well, let's get busy. [sighs] "Started." Copy that. I just think that meet-and-greets are... Espresso? Ah, done. You... ooh... just expect me to do all this bullshit that I never agreed to do. Shelli : Chris likes 67 degrees, but Tom's dressing room must be 70 and, apparently, there's only one control for this whole floor. Copy that. So we'll have to set it all to 67 and pray to God Tom's room can support a space heater. Copy that. [indistinct radio chatter] Oh, your sister Sharon has been calling the promoter rep, saying she wants to sit closer. Uh, tell her she can eat a bag of vegan dicks, but not in those words. Never... never mind. I'll call her myself. [chuckles] Copy and copy. It's always about requests and passes and her judgmental eyes and her SoulCycle thighs. [laughs] That rhymed. Put her with everyone else. She was horrible to me my entire childhood. Copy. [sighs] [background chatter] And may I say that... I'm very sorry to hear that? [sentimental pop music] You are? You deserve better. I do? Of course. Hmm. [quick inhale] Should I get that space heater? Yes. ♪ You will forget someday... ♪ [sighs] [scoffs softly] ♪ I don't need another by my side ♪

Now, is it true that Bill Hanson used to live here? 'Cause we were wanting to put up a little plaque. Bill. How you doing, Lorraine? See you cut down the forsythia, huh? Snowplow got them. How's Chuck? I'm with someone new. No, not remarried. Just happy. Look, I-I-I know this is a little weird. Ah, a little weird would be you calling. You actually being here is... [sighs] worrying. Are you dying? Yeah, I am. But very slowly just like everybody else. Have you been drinking? No, I haven't. I, uh... can... I'm done with all that.

It happened in Atlanta. We're together. We're like friends and lovers. We're like... flovers. Rick's flovers with everyone. This is different! Be happy! I mean, me and Rick, you and Reg... Natalie, there's nothing going on between me and Reg. I have so much to teach you. I'm like one of those Greek Shakespearean characters who takes you across the river of great knowledge. Can you tell someone to make sure that there's almond milk in Rick's dressing room? Rick doesn't drink almond milk unless it's almond milk beer. Ugh! And it's super cold in his dressing room! And... can you see if you can find me a cronut? [snaps fingers] Thanks. [somber folk music] Anyone have eyes on Bill? Have we checked the morgue? Kidding. I think. Of course, if you really want to create the ultimate box set for this band, what you need is... the yearbook. The "yearbook"? So what... exactly is a-a-a "yearbook"? Oh, do you not have them in England? Okay, it... basically it's like a big book that kids make to commemorate the end of the school year. Legend has it that Christopher stumbled upon someone's old yearbook at a Salvation Army. It had all these inscriptions in it. Now, it became kind of a talisman for him. Some say that many of the "Janine" era lyrics were inspired by and written in the pages of the actual yearbook. Wow. Of course, others say it doesn't exist. I'm actually one of those people. Well, that is fascinating. [door opens] Ah, Shelli. Mm-hmm? This is the... Oh, Shelli Anderson, production manager. Hi. This is the magnificent, charismatic, and not-so-shadowy-anymore Mr. Mike Finger. Uh-huh. Shelli for Jojo. Can we get a working pass for Mike Finger? Oh, my God. Uh, Reg, I need you. [sniffs] Uh, there is a woman named Janine. Janine Beckwith? [clears throat] Uh, I need you to meet her at will call. Make sure she gets two tickets, but no pass. That's very important. Shelli, with all due respect... Janine? [whispers] I am inches away from getting Finger to crack. Can't you or Bill... Listen, Reginald. Maybe it's the goddamn supermoon, but Bill has picked this wonderful f*cking day to completely disappear. Which doesn't mean he's gonna drink again. Nobody's saying that. Maybe he is on a quest for some mythical jacket. Maybe that's not as fake as it sounded. But I am dealing with some severe guest list bullshit, including the f*cking governor, which not one member of this band wishes to meet. Also, I am about to see my sister Sharon, whose approval I have never once gotten and never, ever stopped longing for. Do you want to see me shoot myself with this temperature gun? [temperature gun beeps] If not, you will find this Janine, give her her f*cking ticket, no backstage. Explain to her that the band has to leave right after the show, which, weirdly, is true. They're pulling a runner. And P.S., you're welcome, because she is probably the only one who was smart enough to keep anything box-set wise. Reginald? That's not your name? It is. I just enjoyed hearing it being said by you. I will find this Janine. [sharply exhales] [laughs] sh1t. Nobody is safe today. Wait! What does she... look like? Uh, she probably couldn't tell you. No one's seen Janine in years. She's actually here, like, tonight? That is crazy. Oh! Hold your every thought. I will be back in a jiff. Less than a jiff.
