Phil left no f*cking instructions for his memorial. Well, he did leave one little instruction. He did? What is it? Were you ever gonna tell me? No, it's fine. It's being dealt with as we speak. How are you? How do you look this beautiful? [laughs] I don't know... I can't even remember if I brushed my teeth or not. Here. I'll tell you. ♪ Ring them bells with an iron hand ♪ 
♪ So the people will know ♪ Um... no. I have to call Lenny Kravitz back. And Mary J. Blige. I mean, everybody and their f*cking brother wants to perform for Phil. That's good. Harvey. Hey. Kelly Ann almost just cost us ten grand again by skateboarding during the damn load-in. Eh, what else is new? So let me get this straight. Lenny Kravitz has called, but we haven't heard from Christopher House? Mm-hm. It's a cold world out there, baby. Yeah. Yeah. Is it wrong that I'm a little bit relieved that he's gone? I mean Phil f*cking scared me. Mm. He wouldn't have hurt you, Harvey. I was just scared he was gonna talk me into another one of his schemes. Phil was f*cking persuasive. man over radio :  Bill, go to two. So, wait. Phil did leave instructions? Go for Bill. Are you gonna tell me what those instructions are? No. That one's for Gary Clark, Jr. I feel like you're not listening to me right now. ♪ For the blind and the dead ♪ Really? ♪ Ring them bells ♪ 
♪ For all of us who are left ♪ Kelly Ann. Wes. It's a memorial. You're dressed like you're going to an Elvis party. [laughs] I dressed for Phil. This is what he told me to wear. Really? Yeah. He came to me in a dream and said, "Get high and dress the f*cking way you want to dress, and furthermore, I'm coming back." [impersonating Phil] Son, every cloud you see and ever cord you hear... [clicks tongue] ...I'll be there. It doesn't really sound like him. Oh, it was him. I know it was. It probably was. Listen. Is it true what people are saying? Ugh. Reg and I just got drunk together. Nothing happened. Ew, dude, no. I'm talking about Phil. Is it true that he whispered his dying words to you? Yeah. f*ck. I know. Well? Well, I don't know. I'm trying to figure out what they meant. I... I don't... There you are. Yeah. Good luck, man. Hi. Hi. I thought that you'd gone back to England. No. Phil had some... very specific last wishes, and I've just been helping Bill carry them out. What were they? I mean, it's a bit hard to... You're wearing a dress. True. You're the most elegant rigger I've ever met. Well, you're the only rigger I've ever met. Thank you. [laughs] Did you really think I'd leave without saying good-bye? Have you seen Preston? Who? Preston. The Staton-House manager. Preston. I don't know. What's he look like? Oh, my God. Have you never met him? He never shows up. God, I love this world that makes no sense. Why do you need him? Because I f*cked up. I let my emotions get in the way and I f*cked up royally. He got what he wanted from me and he's gonna tell the head of Extantion. And he's gonna try not to pay, because that's how rich people stay rich. And I never knew that I could f*ck up like this. And it feels incredible. I f*cked up, and it's such a f*cking relief. Though I'm sad about Phil dying. Guys, guys! Donna had a baby... Or... Laurie had Donna's baby. Come here. Come here. Come here. Great. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Listen. I'm gonna go and find Preston, but do not disappear. Hm. Look at that face. Um, I think we have to go a little slower. Yeah, just a little slower, please. Yeah. Would be perfect. Thank you. Look. We have got to tell this crew that their band is breaking up. We have to tell them, Shelli. Oh, this f*cking tour. They didn't break all the eggs. They didn't what? Listen. I do want to be clear... [phone rings] ...about one thing... I'm so sorry. It's Nicole Atkins. One second. Let me just... Yeah, I'm here. Shelli? One second. Shelli. Hi. Just one moment. I can't talk about this right now... Excuse me. I'm looking for the production manager. I'm the f*cking production... Hey, there, lover. Sean. [both laughing] Wow. Sean. Wow. I can't believe you didn't call, or call and cancel. Oh, Shel. You know, it's Phil. You only get one Phil a generation. And look at you. You look amazing. Ha... Sean, meet Bill. Bill. Sean. Finally. Bill Hanson. [laughing] I feel like I know you. Yeah. Does she talk about me? You know what? Not so much lately. Yes. I do. I feel like I know you anyway. [laughs] Man... yeah. I know what you mean. Oh, man. Real familiarity there. I got to hug you. I got to hug you, man. Come on. Open it up. That's it. God, I've heard so much. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you too. Where you been hiding this guy? I haven't been hiding. I've been right here. Yeah, well... Do you work out? Where do you find the time on tour? Bill : You actually look like you're in great shape. Sean : Well, you know... Bill : You could be, like, an Ironman athlete or something. Honey? Can I get you something? Don't let my incredible surprise ruin your day. He's always got one up his sleeve. It is a great surprise. Great surprise. Sean : Yeah. [laughs] I love this guy. Me too. If Christopher House wants to speak with me, he can call me himself. Hey, son. No more napkins. I'll right another song. A sequel to "Janine." Janine II! f*ck, man. Phil's gone. Hey. Watch your language. He ain't gonna hear me. Are you kidding? Phil is everywhere. I'm not even sure if he's dead, man. Here you go. You're gonna leave me for another band, aren't you? No. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll find you, okay? We'll shoot hoops and talk about the old days like you ruining Woody Guthrie's guitar. And Mellencamp blew 50 cigarettes worth of smoke in your child face. [Winston sighs] Good times Good times. Hey, you could teach me how to use your knife. You know what I mean? [imitates knives clashing] Excuse me. Are you Wesley Mason? Why, yes, I totally am. [giggles] You're being sued by the city of Escondido for the proliferation of invasion plants, particularly the Lotus Delphi, which, in your absence from home, has taken over a mile-wide portion of a public greenbelt. By taking these papers, you acknowledge receipt of this subpoena. Sorry for your loss. [Boats' "Advice on Bears" playing] ♪ ♪ f*ck! Looks like she needed time to herself. What do you think? At this point, you probably know her better than I do. I wouldn't say that. No. I'm joking. Say, Wes, would you mind, if you have the time, grab us a couple coffees, please? Coffee? Yeah. Coffee. You know, that beverage that you make better than anybody else? Wes makes these incredible espressos called "Wes-pressos." None for me. Thanks. You know what? That's a good point. I've been drinking too much coffee myself. Wes, you can cancel the coffees. Thanks. Ugh. So, do you want it or not, Bill? No, thank you. Jesus. Make up your mind, man. He's a great kid. He's been taking Phil's loss pretty hard. Wes : f*cking sh1t! Seriously, man. Damn it! Hey. You know, believe it or not, coffee makes them jumpy. Sorry... who jumpy? Sperm. Oh. Yeah. I mean, which may sound counterintuitive, 'cause you want them to be jumpy, right? But no, not too jumpy. Too jumpy's not good. I didn't know that. I have this incredible app. You can actually figure out when a woman is ovulating. That is incredible. I'm sorry. I don't mean to overshare. No. Not at all. But, you know, with my father dying... Yeah, I'm real sorry about that. That's sad. Oh, thank you. No, and now Phil? You know, I've been looking at everything differently. Yeah. And I'm finally secure financially. And we've always talked about having kids. Like, always. You did? Yeah. Yeah. But it never seemed to be the right time. You know, but now, you know, I realize... Why wait? That... exactly? Why... Why hold back? That's it. You understand. Yeah. I do. I'm gonna boink her. ♪ I graduated high school ♪

And so I think of this because even if Phil could, in some crazy metaphysical fifth-dimension way, somehow find a way to come return to us and give us an encore, he wouldn't do it. But it would be such a surprise. [laughter] Right, Ella? It would be a surprise. And I just want Phil to know that... that we haven't left our seats. No one's left the building. Come on, Phil.

I'd like to get this over with as quickly as possible. [scattered laughs] Now, if you're here, he probably didn't dislike you. Although I can tell you right now he never liked you. [crowd murmurs] And I'm mad at every single one of you. You should've sent him home from the road. You should have told him what I said, "Exercise. Eat healthier." Yeah! I know you think you loved him, but I loved him more. So shame on you. Shame on you! Sean : Wow, she's really mean. Yeah. But you can tell she really loved him. Ella :  Shame on you! Shame on all of you. To tell the truth, I kind of found Phil insufferable. I know. He was an acquired taste. I mean, he cheated, stole, and killed two people. But he never lied. [laughs] You got to give him that. Ella :  Let's keep the Phil imitations to a minimum, shall we? So you're here for Phil, hm? Actually, we need to go somewhere and talk. Alone. So, honey, with everyone dying, there's something I haven't had a chance to tell you, which is actually kind of a big deal. What's going on? Wow. I'm actually nervous. [laughs] What are you doing? You didn't even get on your knees when you proposed. I give you the Maldives. What? Wow. Phase one, massages, coconut water, and round-the-clock beach s*x till I knock you up. Phase two, I spoil you silly while you get fat and happy with tits out to here and a little alien inside. And phase three, we get what we've been working for forever. A real family. Life is fleeting. The time is now. So... what was it you haven't had a chance to tell me? Tom asked me to manage the band. Amazing. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Of course, there is no more band. How'd you know that? Oh, the whole industry knows. But the fact that they approached you is awesome. God, you make me so proud. [laughs halfheartedly] You want to get a head start? During Phil's memorial? I think that would be highly inappropriate. Honey, they'll be at this forever. Come on. We can have s*x a couple times. They'll still be at it. You are not wrong. But I have to get to the stage. Will you please guard these with your life? I got to go. To be continued. Uh-huh. Just hurry back. You really surprised me. Here's a song I wrote for our man in the hat. Our breath is like the sea going in and out on a beach. And when it stops, that's high tide. This is for you, Mr. Valentine, whom I will never, ever forget.

Listen, there's something I want to ask you. Please be honest. Did I find it insensitive that you and Rick got married the day after Phil died? Yeah. Well, it was a civil ceremony, and the party won't be for months, and not my question. Will I ever really trust you? No. Totally understandable, and you probably shouldn't. And also not my question.

It's a reference to this event that took place in Barstow where he sort of intervened on my behalf. He thought I was egregiously under-armed for the situation I found myself in, and he sort of intervened. Uh-huh. It was okay. No one got shot or anything. But it might be a reminder to finish the song we started to write about it called "Seven Things to Do in Barstow." It's kind of like Phil's version of closure. But I'll let you guys get back to it. Again, thank you very much for coming. Thanks, Bill. You guys sound great. Let me know if you need anything, and I can stop back by, so...

Word. Cool. Let's do it. No. I don't mean "word" meaning "okay." I mean "word" meaning "word." There were no last words. Just one word. Four syllables. Okay, well, this is not charades. So, whatever the word was, just share it. I can't really make any sense of it. I don't think I should share it. I mean, was it dirty? No. Okay, good, 'cause we have youngsters here tonight. So, can I count on you? Mm-hmm. Well, let me give you a hand. No. I got it. You look good, Kelly Ann. I can't believe that Phil's last gig was a corporate gig. It wasn't. Phil's last gig was Seattle. Okay? Corporate gig doesn't count. Good. Bill? I know about the band breaking up. And I just can't believe it. It's so sad. Yeah, it is sad. I don't want to go up there. I'll get stage fright. Do it for Phil. He never could figure out whether I was... together : Shelly Ann or Kelly Ann. [laughs] Kelly Ann. Right. He always really seemed to like you. Do a good job. man :  I'm probably the only person in this room who never called that guy Phil. But I'm proud to say that I called him Dad. I didn't see him much when I was growing up. I remember he came to visit me when I graduated Vanderbilt and he brought The Doobie Brothers with him. I was like, "Hey, Dad, I graduated." And there's The Doobie Brothers. So, the day that I graduated, I got their autograph on my diploma. There's, uh... [sobbing] ...so many things... There's so many things that I wanted to say to him, and I never got the chance. But I realized that even though he's not here... doesn't mean that he's not listening. This is for you, Phil, and for Vernon and Ella, and all of our road warriors.

He said... ..."pistachio." I'm not sure whether he meant the flavor or the nut itself, but he said it with such caring that I really... I knew that it was something important. You know, one of the strange things about being here tonight... It's so great to see so many people I know from the past. It's... it's... in spite of the circumstances, it's a... it's... It's a joyous thing. But that was the thing about Phil, was... ...he made friends everywhere he went. He was... he was bringing the people together. He was bringing people together all the time, and... He brought us together. I just met Jess and Holly tonight, and... we get to sing this song. This was...

That's a Phil joke, said about other people. A lot of you here with us are from the Staton-House Band, and I'd like to say that I saw Phil at his peak with my band, and his last lap around was a doozy. We had a long bus ride the other night, and instead of sleeping, he told us a story about how we choose our bands, the bands we love, and the bands we love to tour with. And he told a pretty epic tale about his meeting Lynyrd Skynyrd, and his father's bait shack, and his proposal to Ella, and the birth of Vernon. One thing I've realized about Phil is that he wanted to save people the way music had saved him. And I think he'd begun to wonder in the last few years, with the way things are going, was there a place in the world for someone who did what he did? He saved people. And he always made a point to give a leg-up or a purpose or a piece of advice to everyone that he met and trusted. And in life, that's a person to be treasured. And in our business, that's a roadie. He was old-school and new-school. He was all-school. And he will never be gone. The road is a dangerous place, and it's a hell of a way to lead a life. There's a body count, to be sure. There's a lot of loss, and a lot of men and women don't make it all the way. But I'd like to just add one Phil-ism that he told me on more than one occasion, and that's that, "Even your suckiest day out on tour will be a story that you'll tell later." And he was right. And I think he realized, as I do now, that this job leaves a mark on your life. I spent a lot of time with Phil shoulder to shoulder, and I learned a lot from him. I think that collaboration means that when you dig deep, where it's dark, you need someone there that you trust to hold the lantern. And the next time, when they dig deep, you're there with the lantern. And Phil always had my lantern. And, you know, now that he's gone... ...I wonder where that light will come from. Where are those people that, with their last breath, they'll look you right in the eyes and not say "help" or "save me." We're here to celebrate the person who says, for some reason, with love and mystery, "pistachio." [laughter] Yeah. Pistachio. Change happens. You get your heart broke. You hurt.

So, Reg, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Well, thank you for appreciating it. Wow, this is amazing. Reg, do you like pie? No. But that's very kind of you to ask.

I know your actual reason for bringing me here. I was your patsy. Well, yeah, but that was before I knew how good you are. You are a f*cking street fighter. You are a f*cking genius. Am I? The Janine move. That was brilliant. Using her to break up the band. What? Even I was impressed. That was some world-class sh1t. Can I smoke in here? I don't know how much they're paying you in your company, but you're worth twice as much, at least. Preston, I know you brought me here to prove to Tom that this tour was, in fact, not profitable. But I still believe that it could be. No. No. That's not the plan. This is how it works. This is how Beyoncé and Rod Stewart and Sting... This is how they start their solo careers. They had to cut the deadwood. But you've impressed me. You really have. And I hope you don't have to go back to your numbers guys. Well, I am going back. I'm going back tonight. I've got a ticket.

I... I have the answer to your mystery. Which one? I've got a few going. My dad... he... He liked to bet the horses. And, you know, there's one horse that he liked the best. He chose her and bet on her early, and then every chance he could get. She was his favorite. Her name was Pistachio. [soft guitar music] He picked you. ♪ ♪ You got your nickname. ♪ ♪ Yeah. And it was bestowed. ♪ ♪ I'll tell you this, Phil did not want to be buried in a box. Now, he just happened to tell us this two weeks ago on the ride to Tacoma. He said, "If anything happens to me, and that light, that eternal flame, gets snuffed out, I want you to call Mitch in New Orleans." Can you help me out, here? [laughs] And this is just two weeks ago, mind you. I was there. Reg was there. So, as per his wishes, we called Mitch from New Orleans, who is, without a doubt one of the great specialists... Hey there, Mitch. Anyhow, shall we? Yeah. Okay. Come on, everyone. Come on. Let's head on in, gang. Come on in. Come on in, everyone. Oh, my God. There he is. Oh, wow. [gasps] Okay... Aah! I can't quite fathom... I thought it would be something weird like an open casket, but this is... Dude. I know. Hi, Phil. Hi, Phil. There he is. Harvey :  [chuckles] Look at Phill. Dude, he wants us to hug him. I mean... No. I can't. I mean, I cared a lot about the guy, but I'm not hugging a dead person. He looks so life-like. Puna or Phil? Oh, it's a unique situation to be sure. Yeah. Well, I mean, it is pretty much the way I was gonna remember him. Is he definitely... dead? He is. He's not dead. His spirit is alive. Yeah, man. No, he's dead. He is dead. Phil's a f*cking state of mind, dude. That's just the body that held him. Even though he sure looks like he needs a hug. Yeah, it's been a night of firsts on many levels, but yes, this goes right to the top of the list. I think I'm gonna faint. I'm just gonna... Okay, now. Yeah, have a seat, Milo. Take a load off. Take some deep breaths. Now... who'd like to go first? What do you say, Pistachio? I... I think I might need to work up to it. He looks sad. Well, see, that's the thing. He's not. Right, Reg? He's not sad. This was Phil's final wish, to be at the crossroads of human emotion, undertaking, and taxidermy. And that's right where we are. Maybe he knows I'm going to prison for invasive flowers. Oh, Wes, you're not gonna go to prison. Not while I'm alive. All these people. These beautiful lights. And these musicians and these roadies. Kids and adults. We may never see these people again.

That I can't give you the life that you may want. And I don't know what's left of this business, and I don't know where I'm going from here, and... I don't care. It doesn't matter. Maybe it did at some point, but... ...the Shelli that Sean used to know, he knew better than anyone. But now there's a whole new side of her that is totally foreign to the original Shelli. Like a whole new being, really. And she doesn't feel right with him. She has no idea what to do now, but she knows what she can't do anymore. And she has you to thank for that. Is that so? All right. Now, should I be concerned that you're referring to yourself in the third person like that? Probably. That's okay, 'cause all the greats do it at one time or another. And let me just say this. Bill Hanson might not have all the answers, but Bill Hanson loves you. And he has for a very long time. Yeah? Yeah. Know how I know that? 'Cause Bill Hanson told me. [laughs] He did. Yeah? Yeah.
