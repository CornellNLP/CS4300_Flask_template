 Bill :  Previously on "Roadies"... 
 New set lists. 
 We're gonna open with "Janine" tonight. 
 Just tell me why did we start changing the set list? 
 We should have never started playing "Janine." 
 I actually really appreciate your brutal honesty. 
 I would very much like it if you'd stay. 
 Times like these, I used to like a little drink. 
 Remember that time at the tiki bar where you took that torch... 
 I'm not that guy anymore. 
 "Bassist Rick Bayless was clearly inebriated by the end of the evening." 
 You go after Rick, you go after me. 
 I'm sorry, Natalie. 
 We had to get a restraining order on your visits. 
 And here I was thinking foolishly that we had the makings of some sort of friendsh... friendship. 
 You don't want to be my friend anyway. 
 You two are in denial... about a lot of things. 
 [cheers and applause] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, you have... wait, what's your name? 
 It's Kelly Ann. Are you okay? 
 Now I need you to put the word "oxygen" on your thing, this thing, okay? 
 The teleprompter, before we play "Janine," because I need oxygen to sing that f*cking song, 'cause she f*cking broke his heart. 
 Yeah, I'll remind you, man. I'll remind you, Rick. 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 No, we should have never started playing that song because... you know, 'cause Christopher's my friend and she f*cking broke his heart, you know? 
 Did you know that he hasn't said her name in seven years? 
 Did you know that, Marianne? 
 Seven years. 
 Hey, it's Kelly Ann, Rick. 
 Kelly Ann. 
 That's what I said. 
 Rick : Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Would you do that thing that you do when you just make them disappear? 
 woman : I love you, Rick! 
 Uh, yeah. Gotcha. 
 Just backstage, dressing room. 
 You're the best, man. 
 All right, yeah, you got it. 
 There he is! 
 Milo : Hey, how's it going? 
 Yeah, Rick, uh, he wanted you to know that he really enjoyed hanging with you today, but, uh... [clicks tongue] we gotta hit the road, so... 
 Did you like the, uh, like the show?

 Ugh, that smell you are smelling is me. 
 Ugh, it's me. I reek. 
 It's actually me. 
 I have such a great day off planned. 
 Me too. 
 You both do? 
 Well, I've always wanted to see Cave Hill cemetery, but I can't get anyone to go with me. 
 And Bill actually suggested we go together. 
 I can't wait. I f*cking love a cemetery. 
 Donna : Me and West Coast are hitting Hammerheads for duck fat fries. 
 Shelli : Mmm. 
 How does that sound, Kelly Ann? 
 It sounds... wait, what do you mean? 
 Shelli : Uh, I'm gonna take a long-ass shower. 
 The minute we check in tomorrow, I'm gonna order an omelet with, uh, bacon and onions and maybe a... a scone if they have one. 
 [phone ringing] 
 Hey. 
 Kelly Ann : Shelli... is Rick okay? 
 What? 
 Never mind. The cemetery sounds... 
 I know. amazing. 
 Colonel Sanders buried there. 
 Really kinda like a technical advisor slash, you know, guitar ninja slash, you know, lots... lots of slashes in my title. 
 Oh, and tomorrow, there happens to be a day off as fate would have it. 
 Cool. That's Bill. 
 He's a great guy, yeah. 
 Gooch... 
 Mm. 
 You said you needed your per diem tonight. 
 Who's the man? 
 Oh, no, you the man. Thanks, bro. 
 Mm. 
 You think maybe I could get an advance? 
 'Cause I have to send my old lady some more money. 
 Again? 
 Yeah, well, you know, so got this cousin who needs something reconstructed. 
 You seen pictures of my old lady? 
 No. 
 Right there, check it out. 
 Right... this your wife? 
 That's my wife. 
 This is your wife? 
 That's my wife, Sandy, bro. 
 Whoa-ho-ho! 
 My man. 
 Huh? 
 Put it down. 
 Oh, my bad, sorry. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna meet up with her tomorrow in Louisville. 
 I can't wait. 
 I can see why. 
 Yeah, especially since my last few days off, she had to cancel on me at the last minute. 
 Mm. 
 But I'll be seeing her tomorrow, God willing. 
 [chuckles] 
 That's right. 
 Wes :  Dude, I've been telling you all week  if we just flip 250 and 251's wheels to the back, RH 6 will snuggle right in there. 
 Okay. 
 What? Why aren't you arguing with me? 
 It's Rick. I let him down today. 
 His rhythm got all f*cked. 
 This band... if you take away the bass... 
 Yeah, he was having trouble finding the tempo. 
 He's having trouble finding the stage, dude. 
 All right, get a good piece. 
 Oh. 
 God, he just lives for that moment on stage where the hops... 
 Meets the grapes, I know. 
 Meets the grapes, right, yeah. 
 So, you know, "Beer before wine, everything's fine," right? 
 But last week, he asked me for a Glenfiddich, so I'm like, I don't know, "Wine before scotch, not on my watch." 
 So I gave it to him after the wine, during Christopher's second solo, but now he's on the Lunesta, man. 
 Nothing rhymes with Lunesta.

 It just makes you smell better. 
 Well, maybe you.

 Or you can just stop talking right now. 
 And then I'm gonna get a magazine, and then I'm gonna get real comfy on there, and then me and Donna are gonna go out for duck fat fries. 
 That is a plan. 
 I like duck fat. 
 Shelli : Bill? Bill? 
 Hey, let's get an early start tomorrow, okay? 
 Early start? 
 Cave Hill. 
 Here, listen to this. 
 "Forget-me-nots creep from grave to grave." 
 Right, Cave Hill. That... th... was that definite? 
 Kayla : Mmm, pizza. 
 Because, um, I'd thought that we'd left that sort of open-ended, so I, you know...

 Reg : No, it's a Fendi case. 
 Fendi. Fend with an F. 
 Yeah, well, no, I don't have it. 
 That's why I'm calling you. 
 It's been sent where? 
 But we... I'm... I'm not in Atlanta anymore. 
 I am at the Haverford Royal, Louisville. 
 Yeah, no, do not send it two days express. 
 You need to overnight it, okay? 
 Yes, thank you. Harvey! 
 Reg : Harvey? 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 Important announcement. 
 Lonny : What the f*ck is he doing here? 
 No firing someone on my bus, okay? 
 Oh, I am not. In fact... 
 I have everyone's room key packets. 
 Milo. Here you go, Donna. 
 Donna : Thank you Uh, Kelly Ann, Lonny. 
 Hey, guys, have a great day off. 
 Oh, and by the way, I'm doing my very first open mic night tonight at Chortles on River Street. 
 So if you're in the mood for some stand-up comedy... 
 Thank you, Harvey, Yeah, that sounds, uh... 
 Anyway, we've managed to be rather clever with group bookings, haven't we? 
 Ah, it was mostly you. 
 Reg : Eh, well, you helped immensely. 
 Harvey : Well, it was your idea, Yeah, enough. So, you may well be wondering... 
 Why are we parked in front of the Haverford? 
 Well... 
 Well, you've been upgraded from the hotel number six to the Haverford Royal. 
 Seriously? 
 Reg : Seriously. 
 Gooch : Oh, f*cking cool, man. 
 My wife is gonna love this. 
 Reg : You are most welcome. Uh, you are... 
 Gooch. 
 Gooch, yeah. 
 No, we've not met. 
 I know. 
 I've been avoiding you. 
 Yeah, well, that explains it. 
 Yeah, so, you know, I've been, um, studying the route. 
 Routing, not route. 
 Yeah, well, the, uh, "routing" for this tour looks like it was created by a drunken child with a highway map and a crayon. 
 For instance, why are we going straight from here to St. Louis? 
 Harvey : I believe Tom Staton's piano teacher is from St. Louis. 
 Yeah, but that makes no sense. 
 I mean, we're skipping valuable markets. 
 Why not stop in, uh, Toledo or Cincinnati? 
 [aggressive electric guitar flourish] 
 sh1t. 
 God damn it. 
 What? 
 f*ck! 
 So close! 
 You done it now. 
 Jim : Hey, did somebody just say the C word? 
 Sorry, I don't understand. 
 You said the C word on the bus. 
 Damn. 
 I most certainly did not. 
 Gooch, I-I was almost out the door. 
 It don't matter. 
 We all have to stay till we break this thing now. 
 Break what thing? 
 Wes : Wait, wait, it doesn't count. 
 'Cause he shouldn't be here in the first place. 
 He doesn't live here, right? 
 I actually didn't even hear him. 
 Milo didn't hear him say it. It doesn't count. 
 I could read his lips, though. He said the C word. 
 I most emphatically did not say the C word. 
 Listen, it... it doesn't matter if the person lives on the bus or not. 
 And it doesn't matter if everybody heard them or not. 
 We're cursed. 
 Cursed? 
 Hi. 
 Are you Jim James? 
 I think so. 
 I'm a fan. 
 Reg : What does he mean, cursed? 
 Gooch : Oh, look at this, man. 
 It's f*cking starting already. 
 My wife, Sandy, just texted me that she's not gonna make it after all. 
 Another f*cking cousin emergency. 
 Oh, Gooch, sorry to hear that, man. 
 Th... that's what you're sorry to hear? 
 How about the fact that our tour just got cursed? 
 We gotta break this thing, guys. 
 Break what thing? 
 They're upset because you said a certain four-syllable city in Ohio while on the bus. 
 [chuckles] Oh. Oh, I see. 
 Well, I don't, 'cause it makes no sense. 
 But, um, I assure you it won't happen again. 
 My apologies. Have a good day, all. 
 Uh-uh. 
 No one leaves. 
 [upbeat rock music] 
 Yeah, I'm here in Louisville with this super sweet guy. 
 He's their manager. 
 Tour manager. 
 [chuckles] 
 And we're about to check in to this super nice hotel, so... 
 [laughing] 
 Yeah, that's the plan. [chuckles] 
 Oh. 
 Rick's gone. 
 What? 
 Oh, sh1t, I-I-I shouldn't have put it that way. 
 Huh? 
 He's not... 
 No, don't look like that. He's not dead, probably. 
 He's missing. 
 What are you doing talking to me like that? 
 You're gonna give me a heart attack over here. 
 What? 
 He... he's missing? 
 He had a phoner in Seattle this morning. 
 No word from him, wasn't answering his phone. 
 I asked them to check the hotel finally, nothing. 
 The mini bar hadn't been touched, so... 
 Okay, he never checked in. 
 And Puna? 
 Puna's calling the hospitals. 
 Jesus. 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 All right, it looks like we got a new plan. 
 Oh. 
 My plans had already been f*cked, so... 
 [sighs] 
 I gotta go. 
 Now, come on, let me out before this stops being mildly amusing and turns into more of a hostage situation. 
 [chuckling] 
 I can't help you, bro. 
 Not till we drive 100 miles. 
 What? 
 Wa... wa... wait, 100 miles? 
 100 miles in the wrong direction. 
 No, no, I-I heard it was 79 miles. 
 Yeah, me too. For the year they died. 
 Who? 
 Yeah. 
 Who? 
 Exactly. 
 It is 100 miles. 
 First the eggs, then the balloons.

See, back when I was partaking... now, this is before you and I started working together... uh, Rick and I, we... we used to party pretty hard together, in every city. So, uh, you know, don't worry. I'm mainly worried because you look so worried. [man sings indistinctly on stereo] I know. But there was that great moment when it went silent, after "All the Beauty," and... and someone shouted out, "I love you, Rick." Remember? Yeah. That was me. He just looked so lost up there. And now he is. So you actually believe that because I said the name of that city that I've cursed your bus? Not just the bus, the whole tour. Yeah, but that is just utterly... Gooch says it's 11 balloons. I thought the eggs and the balloons had to add up to 11. No, it's 11 balloons, one for each person. What persons? Shh. We're trying to figure out how many eggs. Oh. Am I being confusing? I'm so very sorry. Kelly Ann, didn't Phil say you could call him if you needed him? I don't think he meant I could actually call him. No one's calling f*cking Phil. Hey, there, what can I do you for? Hey, do you remember me? Of course, darling, film school will always be there. Your heart just required a little more music. So you found me here in space, and I'm a little woozy. I love Taylor Swift, but God damn, I f*cking miss gravity. I didn't realize that's what makes you sh1t. [chuckles] Talk about bad blood, you... Well, I'm really sorry to bother you. Uh, we're trying to break a curse, and somebody said something, unfortunately, on the bus. The C word? Yes. We're just wondering how many eggs we should... man : Hey, Phil. Hey, cool your jets! Somebody's cursed back on Earth. You need 11 balloons and 11 eggs. You gotta find 'em on foot, and then everybody that was on that bus has to break the eggs and release the balloons, and then somebody's got to play a song by The Who. [electric guitar strumming] Don't look so worried. Everything's gonna be beautiful, Shelly Ann. Oh, it's Kelly Ann. Make sure you break all those eggs. I learned that on my first tour with Nine Inch Nails... the hard way. Got it. Thanks. This is Captain Phil, signing off from outer space. See you next time. Bye. [sighs] You know, about the cemetery, I'm pretty sure we left it loose, didn't we? [light instrumental music] We were on the bus, uh, driving in Chattanooga past a church with chipped gray paint, and a sign saying, "He needs our hands and feet." You were peeling a hard-boiled egg, and you said, "Hey, check out these shoes. I've had 'em for years, but I've never worn 'em." And then we passed a cemetery, and you said, "You've been to Cave Hill, right?" And I said, "Uh, no, I haven't. Have you?" And you said, "Yeah, a long time ago." And I said, "Well, we got a day off in Louisville." And you said, "Let's go to Cave Hill together." And I said, "Are you serious?" And you said, "Yes." And I said, "That is such a good idea." And you said, "I know." And then you ate your egg. That's how we left it. Hey, is there food where we're going? 'Cause I'm f*cking hungry. [phone ringing] That Rick? Double D. On our f*cking day off. Don't take it. Don't worry. f*ck, f*ck, f*ck. And the only way to stay alive once exposed is to have s*x every nine days.

♪ Only one thing is clear ♪ One scone. That's all I wanted. But why should I get anything I want today? Ah, we're gonna get you a f*cking scone. Don't make any more promises you don't intend to keep. A place right near here, always open. Let me guess, you and Rick used to go there back in the day, after a night of bar-crawling debauchery? Now, you realize that Red Velvet and Arthur, they were trying to swing with us. [chuckles] You're crazy. "Do you enjoy jazz? Hmm?" "Jazz" is not jazz, okay? [chuckles] No, no f*cking way, no. [chuckles] Jazz is code. Lifestyle code. Really? Oh, yeah. Huh. [chuckles] I can't... I ca... I-I can't deal with this right now. Um, I am trying Milo back. [line ringing] [birds chirping] Milo : I don't feel so good, man. Oh, sh1t. I think I'm dying. Wes : What? Milo : With the... I need to take a break or something, man. How long have we been walking for? Like, four minutes. [phone ringing] Shelli, hi. Yeah, I can't talk right now. Wha... what? What? What? What? It's all true. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What about Rick? All right, is he still... Is he still missing? Wait, what? Oh, f*ck. Oh, God! Oh, no. Rick the bass player's missing? f*ck! The f*cking tour is cursed. Have you heard nothing about what I said? This has nothing to do with... with the curse or The Who. I mean, it's Rick! Rick... Rick is mine! He's my responsibility! [sighs] I'm a f*cking failure, man. Dude, no, no, you're not. [light acoustic guitar music] Am I hallucinating? Oh. Shh... Wes : Oh! Oh, yes. Yes. [gasps] Okay. That's seven. We need four more. Wait. I got this. Oh. [chuckles] Yes. Thank Christ I never get laid, huh? And that you're hung like a horse. It's both a blessing and a curse, my friend. Wow. They're in the middle of nowhere. Reg said the C word on their bus. Get out of town. I know. Gooch wouldn't let him out. They... they drove the 100 miles with him trapped on there. There is a God. I just hope he had to take a sh1t. Ah. New carb smell. Place looks exactly the same. Hmm. Hello? Hi, there. Hey. Um, when you get a chance, I think we'll have a couple of these raspberry scones and then... One of these guys too. Yeah, and then one... Sir, are you okay? You got a lot of balls coming back here. What? I don't want any more trouble from you, okay? Just go. No, no, no, I think you have the wrong... I said get the f*ck out of here! Okay. All right. Just... no problem. Just take it easy. All right, which way? You choose. This way. No, that seems wrong. But you just said... We're never gonna find any f*cking eggs out here anyway. You get cross so easily. What? Has this whole curse thing ballsed up your plans, then, for your day off? Has it "ballsed up" my plans? No, I didn't have any f*cking plans. Well, neither did f*cking I. [sighs] What do you say now? Just keep walking. I was right. I was right and you were wrong. You found the house from the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Congratulations. Well, they could have eggs. Or guns. I assume all you people have guns. I may have no future, but I don't want to die. Hello? Hello? [knocks on door] Hello? Wait. Right, you stand watch while I check the fridge. Stand watch? Come on. Yes. Behold. I just think we should leave them a note or something explaining it. How could this possibly be explained? Well, I just think if I came home and I found my eggs were missing... We're thieves, it's theft, it's self-explanatory. We only need 11, so you leave them one. What? So they have one for breakfast. Many people skip breakfast. Yeah, but it's the most important meal of the day. f*ck! Okay, here you go. All right, let's go. No, that's somebody's sweatshirt. We must protect the eggs. Now come on. Let's go. Kelly Ann! All right, fine. You stay here while... Okay, you were right. Come on, Reg, let's go. But look. We're leaving now. Is that a person? I wouldn't worry about it. Maybe they're sleeping. Just having a nap. Yeah, absolutely. They're just... they're having a nap. [toilet flushes] [both gasp] [both panting] Go, go, go, go, go! [gentle instrumental music] ♪ ♪ [both laughing] Ah! [both laughing] Please. ♪ ♪ Please. Wait. [inhales] [exhales sharply] Not one crack. Take that, curse. Practically broken. You don't actually believe in such a thing as a curse, do you? I do. You do not. It's scientific. People's beliefs affect their behavior. It's very important in marketing as well. It is the enemy of being "spendcentric." If one believes oneself to be cursed, then one will be. The tour will inevitably suffer. From my view, not worth the risk. [camera shutter clicks] Did you just photograph... Did you just photograph my foot? I may not... believe in it. Well, then why did you follow me in there? [phone chimes] What? They got the balloons. Listen, it's actually not cool just to walk on a bus you don't live on unless you're invited. And I don't know if you were coming to see a specific person, say me, but if you were, um, it... it just kind of puts me in an awkward position. Just had a revelation. Okay. When I said to you that we, um, could be friends, um, what you... you don't realize is... well, how could you, you don't even know me... is that... I never become emotionally involved. That's just fact, who I am. So... don't need to worry because... I don't feel things in the way that other people do. You see. I don't either, actually. You can ask anyone. I don't get involved. And... I'm happy this way. Well, then, we have that in common. What do you mean, you may have no future? Of course you have a future. ♪ ♪ [pensive acoustic guitar music plays] ♪ ♪ Oh, they got 'em. They got the eggs. Nice, dude. Right on, man. Wes : Yes. man : Yeah. [laughter] Harvey : Got one, right? Thank you. [laughter] Thank you, sis. man : Great job. You did awesome, okay? Jim : All right, everybody, Close your eyes. It's 1979. You're 15. And you're about to see your favorite band play your first concert. Wes : You showed up eight hours early for the festival seating just to get up close, with the band. You see 'em breathe and sweat. Can feel the rhythm in the air. It's all around you. You wait outside with all your friends. This is gonna be the best night of your life. [playing The Who's "They Are All In Love"] ♪ Where do you walk ♪

Finishing each other's sentences? I-I was gonna say completely wrong for each other, but, yeah, they were finishing each other's sentences for sure. How can you say it was cursed? Janine broke his heart. And he wrote an insanely beautiful song. Yeah, you probably played it at your wedding. [chuckles] Oh, boy. You did. [laughs] You did. So? So the thing is, people don't realize that these songs that they play at their weddings, a lot of times they come from some serious pain, you know? Yeah... Oh, baby! What a surprise! Look at you!
