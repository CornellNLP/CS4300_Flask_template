 Milo :  Previously on  Roadies... 
 Shelli :  Kelly Ann? I need you to take photos at the VIP meet and greet. 
 You are invited to leave the organization now. 
 Let me just talk to him. 
 woman : Oh, God! Down! Down! 
 Hey. 
 Finger holds the key to our box set. 
 I'd like to officially welcome our band archivist, Mr. Michael Lewis Finger. 
 Reg :  Uh, So, Janine is here. 
 So, how is Janine? 
 She's great. She's fabulous. 
 Should we invite her to come tonight? 
 Definitely not. 
 I think she would love that. 
 Christopher :  You should call and invite her. 
 Reg :  I will do that. 
 Bill :  But no backstage. 
 Janine. 
 Hi, Chris. 
 You're about to find out what it's like on the other side of the fence, what it's like to be used. 
 Why don't we table this, Janine, and... 
 Maybe it's time we tell your best friend about the time that you drove me home from Tulaggi's and we f*cked. 
 What is she talking about, Bill? 
 Janine : I f*cked his brains out, Chris, because I knew it would hurt you.

 Bill : I'm from Oklahoma, so I kind of grew up with Switzer. 
 He was kind of a cool coach too, but, hey, go Huskies, man. Take it easy. 
 Stay safe. 
 man : You too. 
 [crickets chirping] 
 Single car accident. 
 Just got to wait for it to clear out. 
 Go back to sleep. 
 I wasn't asleep. 
 Are there people in there? 
 No. The cops said when they pulled up it was empty. 
 I've flipped a couple of cars. 
 I think they're probably okay. 
 Three nights ago, outside that truck stop in Salt Lake, I saw a crow eat a Kentucky Fried Chicken leg. 
 Bird cannibalism, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't know that was a thing. 
 Well, I got a picture of it. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, you shouldn't be looking at stuff like that. 
 Or like that. 
 Next truck stop, you just buy a couple refrigerator magnets. 
 Something real cheerful, you know? 
 Do you ever think that maybe this tour could be cursed? 
 I don't believe in that sh1t at all. 
 Yeah. Me neither. 
 I mean, if this tour were cursed, why would the band be playing better than ever? 
 Why would I have finally found us a great new special guest, after only four days of begging? 
 Huh? That ain't cursed. 
 Halsey. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 Wes'll freak. He loves Halsey. 
 Really?

 Bill :  Hi. Bill. Alcoholic. 
 Um, I have two years in July. Uh, last night, I got a call from, um, my boss and oldest friend, who's, uh, been sober for significantly longer than I have, and he'd been drinking, and, uh, so I figured I better get myself on down to a meeting and, uh, find a chair. So, thank you. Uh, I'm on the road a lot, and, uh... I'm a carpet salesman. I sell carpet all over the country. And, uh, I love carpet. I've run away from, uh... [chuckles] ...pretty much everything in my life except carpet, because, uh, carpet's really the only thing that's ever given me any, uh... real joy. Except there's this woman, and, uh, we sell carpet together. She's married. And nobody in the carpet company knows about us. Well, there's this Bob Dylan song called "Property of Jesus," and it's off this album Shot of Love. I highly recommend the whole album. It's a real kind of unsung classic if you like Bob. But, yeah, in... in "Property of Jesus," he sings, "But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb. What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?" Now, I don't know what happened to the real me. And I don't know if we've ever even met. But I know that when I'm with this woman, I feel like the version of me I wanted to be when I was ten years old or 12 years old. Could have been 14, but you know what I mean. Uh... Yeah, it's wrong. And it's not rigorous honesty, and I feel like a thief. But the question I keep asking myself is, you know, what if this is my one chance, you know? What if this is my only shot at true happiness? You know, don't I have to grab it? And if I don't, what's gonna happen to me, you know, when carpet season's over? And it's her birthday today. And I got nothing to give her. And, uh... That... that's all. Thank you. Well, thank you for sharing, Bill. I just want to say I've never in my life heard anyone speak about carpet like you just did. I will never look at carpeting the same way again. Thank you. Also, women love being asked, "How's your day going? Tell me everything." You'd be surprised how few men ever ask their lover that question. Yeah? [indistinct chatter and laughter] Copy that. And copy that. Thank you. And I'll be praying for your friend. Okay. Bill : That's what I said. Halsey! [all cheering and applauding] Also, as some of you may know, the band is being photographed today  for the cover of Vanity Fair  by the great Abby Van Ness. Oh, my God, she's amazing. Bill : Very lucky to have her shooting the guys. The photo area is directly backstage. [all groan] Bill : Yeah, no, I know it's a real pain in the ass, huh? But you're gonna have to get over it. Also, one more thing. And this is very important, guys. Christopher House's iPad has gone missing, and there are a bunch of new songs that he's been working on on there, so I'd very much appreciate if you'd keep an eye out for it. Let me know if you see or hear anything. And last, but definitely not least, this is a... This is a very special day, um, very special day. [mouthing words] [chuckles] We're, uh... we're in Seattle. Bill : You're breathing some of the same air that Mr. Jimi Hendrix breathed. Also the great Quincy Jones, Kenny G... [laughter] Hey, don't laugh. The man's garnered over 75 million in global album sales. Bill : Duff McKagan from Guns N' Roses, the Seattle Supersonics... Sorry, Wes... Pearl Jam. Let's not forget those humble pioneers known as Mudhoney. Phil : [shouting indistinctly] How the f*ck do you leave out Ann and Nancy Wilson from Heart? Didn't you know "Magic Man" is about me? [all cheering] Get on in here! Get you some. God, I missed you people. My goodness, I missed you guys. man : We've missed you too. Phil : There's my crew, goddamn crew. Phil : Where's my Kelly Ann? Called me all the way into outer space. That made my whole trip almost worth it. Get in here, girl. How are you? Phil : Oh, you got... You got prettier. Yeah, oh, my goodness, I didn't think it'd happen. [Cage the Elephant's "Always Something playing] ♪ Early in the mornin' ♪

Preston :  Darling, I distinctly remember being on the phone with Shelli a few days ago, and I said that the band misses Phil. They feel like nothing's been right since he left. Yeah, but he never said Phil would be back. Phil :  Look, I had to pull in every possible favor to steal him back from Planet Swift, okay? Yeah, it's okay as long as you're fine having a known embezzler head up the tour. I am. And speaking of theft, what's this about Christopher's iPad? He called me, hysterical. Yeah, I know. Look. Uh... ...he's drinking again. What? And writing songs again, right? And hanging by a f*cking thread again. Christopher is drinking again? Yeah. Preston :  Bill? Yeah, I'm here. Uh, look, Preston, I'll find Christopher's iPad, okay? Preston :  Thanks, pal. You know what we call this in Staton-House land, right? Yeah. Preston :  As the House turns. As the House turns. Oh. Preston :  Look, if he's on a big bender, we've got to protect him,  so keep that f*cking photo session super short. Got it. Okay. Preston :  And kiss and make up with Phil. And I'll come out there just as soon as my son's strep throat clears up, so... later, darling. Bye. Jesus. I'm gonna go try and find Chris, if he'll even talk to me. Now, why wouldn't you let me mention your birthday? Eh, it just didn't feel right. And please don't get me anything, okay? What a day. What a day.

Shelli :  Well, it's good to see you, handsome. It's good to be seen. [chuckles] I come bearing news from your husband. He says, "Happy birthday, gorgeous." And your present is somewhere in the stands. Oh, wow. He, uh... He did the treasure hunt thing again. I believe it took some doing, getting it all set up. Yeah. It's this really sweet thing he likes to do, just incredibly sweet. [laughs] It's just I have zero time. Did he at least narrow it down to a section? He did not, darlin'. But we'll have to do something special tonight. You deserve it. Ah, not really. [laughs] Reg! Um... Shelly. Uh... Shelli : Um... f*ck! Uh, Phil. [clears throat] Shelli for Bill. Production hallway, now. Reg. Hello. You look concerned, Pasty Boy. Yeah, uh, uh, that... That is Janine. Janine? Yeah. Uh, yeah, she paid us a visit. Boy, if that isn't a sign of the Apocalypse... I mean, I love that girl, but God damn. Phil, welcome back. Hey, good to see you, pal. Hey. Bring it in. Motherfuck... Yeah, I saw you at morning circle, but you kind of got engulfed there. [Reg gasping] [Phil grunting] [Reg groans] Hey, Phil? Bill : Phil? Got to let him go. [gasping] [gasps] f*ck. Yeah. [panting] Uh, yeah, so, um, as I was, uh, just trying to explain, Janine just texted me... You the famous yearbook? Shelli : Mm-hmm. It's gone missing. Uh, wait. What? Reg : Yeah. And she thinks that we stole it from her. So... First Chris's iPad. Now the yearbook. Yeah. That's the second sign of the Apocalypse: thievery and deception from within. God, I've missed you people. Let's go find this crook. Bill and Shelli? Who told you? No one. I can just tell. Bill and Shelli. That's like your parents having s*x and cheating on each other all at the same time. Whew. Finally ditched the Devil Child. It can't be true. Shelli has this really great marriage. I need your advice. Which you never take. We're in Seattle. Do I invite Mike McCready to the show? Wes, how high are you? Like half and half. No, Wes, you do not invite the guy who fired you to the show. Just interpret this text for me, okay, 'cause it's confusing. "Wes. Sorry. No time. See ya! Mike. Ashley says hi." How is that confusing? What? "See ya." That's encouraging, right? You always do this. You just set yourself up for disappointment. Well, if I don't, who will? Okay, and when is f*ckin' Halsey getting here? Because I would love to shake her hand, marry her, and watch her play, in any order. [ernergetic drum music] His face has become more clear. [surf rock] ♪ ♪ Manamana Lima. Manamana-what? Lima. I believe that's Italian. Puna : A man called finger. Hey, make a path. I've got roadies trying to move sh1t through here, and trust me, they will step on you and keep going. Hi. Are you Shelli? Uh, yes. I'm the production manager. I'm Bethany Ian-Crouch, Abby Van Ness's field assistant. Abby's on her way, but before she gets here, just a few basic things about the way she works. You can pass it on to your minions. Did you actually just say that? First of all, Abby Van Ness will interact with only two of your crew members. Is that okay? No. When Abby Van Ness arrives, she's gonna need ten full minutes of silence when she walks in so she can feel the space and begin her process. Okay, Bethany, let me give it to you straight. This band is going to do a rare sound check to run through a few new songs. Abby Van Ness will have ten minutes maximum before this sound check. [indistinct chatter] I was in space for less than two weeks, and suddenly Janine's back, half the band's off the goddamn wagon, we have comedians opening for us, and the nice kid who ran our website's now a klepto-fucking-maniac. Boy, did you guys miss me. And I still don't have my luggage. How the f*ck are we gonna find Finger? All we know is he lives in Tacoma. 320 1/2 Lung Street. Yeah, Puna, how do you know that? I have Find My iPad. Well, good. Got to get that. I've been meaning to do that... God damn it. I've been meaning to do that for f*cking... Hey, well, should we... should we notify the authorities? Yeah. Phil : Yeah, no, f*ck that. No. f*ck that. Come on. Next thing you know, Chris's demos are all over social media. I'll get our sh1t back. Guaranteed. Yep. That's how we do it Stateside. Phil, with all due respect, I think that maybe I should handle this. I tell you what. We'll go together. I'll meet you outside in 15 minutes. I'm locked and loaded. Well, drive safely. Remember it's the other side of the road. What do you mean, drive safely? Are you f*cking insane? Did you hear what he just said? He's locked and loaded. Did you see that, like... ...demented grin on his face? Yeah, that's a lot of teeth, isn't it? He could just pull over in the middle of nowhere and [mimics gunshot sound] Truthfully, he might not even need the gun. He might just... [grunts] "f*ckin' Union Jack. Whoa, there, son of a bi"... Ah, I think it's one of those things when you've killed a couple people, it's like sports... You just want to go for that third championship ring. However... However? Reg. [sighs] I can't go. I've got a show to do. And I'm not quite ready to be in an enclosed space with Phil. I have my own issues with Phil's return. Do you really want my death on your conscience?

♪ What are we gonna do ♪ 
♪ When everything all falls through? ♪ What's wrong? Oh, hello. Nothing. Just an oddly ambiguous text. And Abby Van Ness is taking pictures, huh? She's my favorite photographer. She's got a tough exterior, but I don't buy it. She couldn't take all of these incredibly emotionally potent, soul-scratching photographs without protecting an achingly beautiful, romantic heart that only a handful of people are ever gonna see. You have something stuck in your... it's... What? Where? It's a piece of hay. Oh. f*ckin'... I... I'll just, uh... Well, you should go and introduce yourself, tell her how much you admire her work, and that you are also a photographer. No. I don't... Yes, you are. You took those photos at the meet and greet. Who do you think suggested you for that? Who? You? You were the spendcentric choice. Why get some outsider when we have you here? You did an excellent job, and I knew you would. That's actually pretty interesting, 'cause you didn't... I mean, you could've paid me something. Just go and introduce yourself. No one ever got angry at a compliment. I don't see myself talking to her. Fine. So, what is, uh, so ambiguous about the text? Oh, nothing. It's nothing. Would you like me to interpret it for you? I have to do it all the time with my brother. Really? Mm-hmm. "R." Full stop. "My yearbook was stolen!" Exclamation mark. "Before I left!" Exclamation mark. "I'm devastated." "There is a lot of missing." Full stop. Which is the part... "There is a lot of missing." Do you think... Is that an admission? Or a... a confession of some sort? It's almost like a song title. It's a typo. Puna? Pun? Would you mind looking at that text for me? It's a typo. Halsey! Shh! [whispering] Hi. I'm Wes. Welcome to the Staton-House Band family. Hi. I heard you guys were, uh, friendly. [stammers] Coffee? Uh, yes, please. Hey, I saw you at Jones Beach in August. It was sick. [whispering] Thanks. Why are we whispering? I don't know. Let's stop. [speaking at normal volume] Okay. Dude, that crowd was f*cking falling asleep. You hit the stage. You opened up with "Castle," like, "Jones Beach! What the f*ck is up?" And you destroyed that crowd. And that turquoise wig was so cool. You should've said hi, Wes. Dude, I love your music. Like, the stripped down version of "Hold Me Down." Come on. No drums, right? It's wicked. Mm... are you the Wesley? Who worked with Mike McCready? Pearl Jam? Their guitarist. Of course, dude. There's only one. Oh, my gosh. I know Liz Burns. I've heard all about you. Bethany : Shush! Abby? Hi. Abby? I'm... I'm Shelli. I'm the production manager for Staton-House. I don't like daisies. Oh. So nice to meet you too. Uh, the band's so excited to be photographed by you. You've... you've got a lot to do, and so do we, so, uh, let me just give you some parameters. Everything needs to be ready before the band arrives. When they do, you'll get ten minutes with them before their sound check. [scoffs] I was given 20 minutes with the Rolling Stones in 1978. I've been photographing them ever since. I had... how long did I have with Prince? 15 months. I had 15 months with Prince. We ended up shooting him in the nude and recording the entire unreleased album at Paisley Park with me singing the lead, with Prince producing. Can't wait for that one to come out. Johnny Cash gave me 18 years. We did a super f*cking emotional session the day he died. My concept... ...is the death of rock. Genius. My band will hate it. I'm not here to vet my ideas to the production girl. You just did. It's f*cking rad. Bethany? It's f*cking rad. It's f*cking rad. Now I want you to get the band to my set and get the f*ck out of my way. Abby, uh, let me tell you what's gonna happen so you can use your ten minutes the best you can. The band will claim they don't want makeup, but Tom actually does. And Rick is gonna try to do, uh, this pose. We call it The Cock. Every photographer hates it. You just have to tell him no. Chris may wander off. And none of them, I guarantee, will sit on that horse, so you might want to think of a backup plan. Thanks for you input. [light acoustic guitar music] Bill :  I want him to find Jen. Phil :  Their relationship is doomed. Jen didn't survive the plague. man :  30 miles to Tacoma. If you're talking about Dead s*x, I mean, he's like a young Anthony Hopkins Here's what I don't get. If the plague only kills average-looking people and the s*x is what saves them, then... It's a f*cking metaphor, man! A metaphor. Reg : Is it? Phil : Beautiful is average; average is beautiful.

But you don't want to be an artist anyway. I mean, you've got this great job lifting things with all these cute boys. And you can't even stick up for your own work right now to me, can you? That's because you had weak parents. Your parents were weak. And you have no rage inside of you. So you have nothing to say as an artist. So, let me make this simple. A, you are talent-free. B, get the f*ck... out of my light. Um... Say it. Say it! A, I barely know my parents. My brother and I were raised in a foster home. B, all I wanted was for you to sign my book, which I have with me, because I carry it everywhere.
