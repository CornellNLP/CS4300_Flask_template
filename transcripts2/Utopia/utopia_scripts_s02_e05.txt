 A transformation future... $8.5 billion for roads, rail and ports... 
 Infrastructure of the 21st centu... benefit future generations... 
 There's no future plan for Australia under this governme... major infrastructure projects... decisions for the long term... want to spend the mon... nation-building projects... 
 I want to be known as the infrastructure prime minister. 
 Nation-building... 
 Nation-building... 
 Reporter : This patch of land has been talked about for decades. 
 Could it now finally be about to take off? 
 A second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek isn't a new idea... was first formally proposed in 1969, sparking decades of protests and promises. 
 It's certainly within striking distance. 
 Federal Cabinet is discussing the plan today. 
 But a final decision doesn't end questions on aircraft no... how it will play out for a swag of marginal seat MPs in western Sydney. 
 Andrew Greene, Canberra. 
 And will that change in the taxiway alignment affect our EAS? 
 Seriously? 
 Just dotting 'i's and crossing 't's. 
 OK, I will give a slab to anybody who finds something we've missed. 
 What about typos? 
 A six-pack. 
 There's only one N in 'concourse'. 
 You don't drink. 
 Ginger beer. 
 You know what, I reckon we call it a day. 
 Come back tomorrow and see if we can't knock this on the head. 
 Thanks for coming in on the weekend, everyone. 
 You're right. 
 Sorry, but... we're close! 
 Good work. 
 You got a minute? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Nation-builders! 
 (Chuckles) 
 Jim? 
 What are you working on? 
 Badgerys Creek. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 I thought with all the other stuff you're doi... might be on the backburner for a while. 
 No! 
 Did you see that news story on the weekend? 
 Yeah. 
 Probably jumped the gun a bit. 
 Not really. We're literally into the final stretches. 
 This early? 
 It's been six months. 
 But your final report, the big kahuna -- we're talking next year? 
 No. 
 Year after? 
 No, no, this year. This month. 
 Whoa! 
 Mate, the PM wanted it fast-tracked, all stops out. 
 Yeah, he did.... does. For sure. But you're not done yet? 
 No, no. We're just working through some noise abatement issues. 
 Ohh, that sounds serious. 
 No. 
 Noise? 
 Abatement. 
 But issues -- plural? 
 Nothing we can't work arou... you need me to buy you time... - ... just to delay it... 
 Del... or cancel. 
 Jim, tell the PM he can relax. 
 This thing stacks up. With him behind it, nothing's stopping us. 
 Yeah, yeah. Okey-dokey. 
 You wanted hard copies of this? 
 Oh, thanks. 
 What's with the paper? 
 It's recycled. 
 Why? 
 It's the 1st of Apr... it a prank? 
 No. We're doing No Paperil. 
 Tony said no more charity months. 
 It's not a charity, it's an eco-challenge. 
 Why is it so faint? 
 We're also printing in draft mo... saves toner and paper. 
 Yeah, but what if you can't read ... you have a moment for Rhonda? 
 Maybe this afternoon. 
 She was hoping it could be earlier. 
 For God's sake, when? 
 Still waiting, Amy! 
 Now? 
 Come in, Rhonda. 
 There she is. 
 There she is. 
 What? 
 I come bearing exciting news. 
 What's this? 
 The Australasian Women of Influence conference. 
 That's last year's. 
 And? 
 One of the organisers, an old friend, called me. 
 Asked if there were any new faces available to present this year. 
 And? 
 And I wondered if I could put your name forward. 
 Ohh, I... 
 Which I did. 
 I'm not a woman of influence. 
 Nation Building Authority, 2... the verge of solving Sydney's second airport! 
 It's a little premature. 
 Lean in, my darling. 
 Rhonda, I'm snowed under. 
 It's a feather in the cap for you and this organisation. 
 I'll have a think. 
 ... the meantime, I'll need a bio, some background information. 
 Tell me what you'll talk about. 
 I said I'll have a think. 
 Congratulations! Good girl! 
 The revised projections. You wanted hard copies. 
 Not sure I'd call that hard. 
 It's bamboo, 'cause we're doing No Paperil. 
 I said no more charity months. 
 It's not a charity. 
 It's an eco challenge. Amy promised it won't be a distraction. 
 She said that on Ride To Work Week, and half the office was injured. 
 Then the Red Nose thing and Vegievember. I'm trying to grow... now a good time to mention the new phone system? 
 No. 
 Here's your schedule for today. 
 Why's it so hard to read? 
 We're printing in draft mode. 
 Who's coming to see me? 
 Jim. 
 When? 
 At... 14:80. 
 That's not a time, that's the Renaissance. 
 Oh, 10:30. 
 Jim's coming in at 10:30. 
 And what for? 
 Badgerys Creek. He just wants an update on the problems. 
 What problems? 
 Is now a better time to show you the new phone system? 
 I'm pretty busy... 
 It'll only take a minute. 
 OK. 
 Everything's pres... you wanna call me you just have to press one -- that's me. 
 One. 
 And then press the button with the little phone on it. 
 Yep. 
 Nothing's happening. 
 Oh! Sorry. Press the button with the phone on it and THEN my extension. 
 Hello? 
 Who's that? 
 Hu... shouldn't be. 
 Sorry? 
 It should be me. I'll try two. 
 Hello, Nation Building Australia. 
 That's A... shouldn't be. 
 And it's 'Authority,' Amy! 
 Sorry! 
 I'll redo the presets. 
 (Sighs) OK. Please. 
 Can I sit there? 
 Yep. OK. 
 (Exhal... you speak French? 
 No. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 YOU wanted to see ME. 
 Did I? 
 Yeah. And you're early. 
 So! What's this problem? 
 I told you yesterday. We solved the problems. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Just that I was chatting to someone in Treasury... 
 Why were you ringing Treasu... was about something else... 
 I mentioned Badgerys Creek in passing and that you guys were having a bit of strife... 
 But we're not. 
 You said something about, 'Terminal problem.' 
 No, I said there'd be an airfreight terminal. 
 Oh! I must have just heard, 'Terminal.' - Yeah. 
 Anyway, wow, did the floodgates open up. 
 Turns out there's a whole bunch of other issues. 
 Which we've solved. 
 You can't have solved them all. 
 Well, we have. 
 Katie : Scott -- Aiden from the Perth office on line one. 
 Katie. It's me, Tony. 
 No, it's Aiden, line one. 
 Yeah, but you've got ... that you, Tony? 
 Y... shouldn't ... ... Scott there? 
 No. 
 Oh. And don't forget that Jim's coming in at 10:30. 
 Oh, I'm he... that you, Aiden? 
 No, it's J... that you, Scott? 
 No... (Sighs) 
 Oh... 
 (Hangs up) 
 I'm sorry, I just haven't had ti... write a simple bio? 
 I am under the pump. 
 We'll do it now. Gimme some paper. 
 What's this? 
 It's recycled. 
 Why? 
 We're trying to save the planet. 
 Oh, For God's sake, can we get our priorities straight in this place? OK. 
 Let's make a start. 
 Katie : Nat, is that you? 
 Yes? 
 Rhonda's on her way over. 
 Thanks, Katie. 
 Shall I tell her you're not in? 
 I am in. Why would you say that? 
 Because normally when you want to get rid of Rhonda... 
 That's fine, Katie. 
 OK. Name -- Natalie. Is that French? 
 No? 
 Shame. OK, Natalie... 
 Francis. 
 Francesca... 
 It's not Francesca... and where did your family come from? 
 Adelaide. 
 Yeah, but, originally. 
 Wollongong. 
 Dear God. Uh, OK -- 'Natalie heads up the Major Projects Divis... the Nation Building Authority.' 
 Yep. OK. - 'A respected leader in her field, she is also a tireless campaigner for...' 
 For what? 
 Over to you. 
 I came up with 'tireless.' 
 Oh, but I don't campaign. 
 Nat, darling. You're the keynote speaker. 
 Time to bring something to the table. 
 When did I become keynote? 
 Gonna make it, 'Francesca.' 
 Katie... 
 Sorry, that call shouldn't have gone to you. 
 But it did. 
 Just press four. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 Hello? 
 Who's that? 
 It's Aiden, again. 
 What? 
 From the Perth office? 
 Sorry, Aiden. I dunno what's... 
 You know what, I'm gonna hang up, or try to. 
 Where were we? 
 You said you hit a wall. 
 No, I said we hit a few speedhumps. 
 So, you still hit something. 
 There's always gonna be sensitivities and some challenges when you're dealing with Federal and State and local government. 
 I thought that'd bring us undone. 
 We're not undone. 
 Seriously, credit to the PM on this. 
 The day he staked his prime ministership on this, waters parted. 
 Right. 
 
 
 
 Is there something you're not telling us? 
 Nup. 
 Good! 
 Aiden : Uh... did you still want me to be on the line, Tony? 
 Katie! 
 'When not spearheading major government campaigns and telling the big boys where to go... Wh... Natalie likes nothing more than...' 
 Reading. 
 Why would you do th... relax. 
 Oh, come on. You're a high-powered go-getter, why would you read? 
 Why don't I put 'road cycling' or 'horse riding'? 
 Because it's not true. 
 What you've never ridden a horse in your life? 
 Well, as a kid... 
 Fine. Horse riding. Put that under interests. 
 Now, complete this sentence -- 'Weekends are no time for rest. 
 Saturday morning will find Natalie...' - Sleeping. 
 After that? 
 Reading. 
 (Whispers) Again with the reading. 
 Give me an activity, a pastime, something. 
 I like going for walks? 
 Excellent! 
 Trekking... 
 Walki... in the Himalayas. 
 Reporter : Lots of discussion around the Badgerys Creek airport... 
 Man : You can build it as fast as political will allows... 
 Man 2 : How soon could we see tarmac being built? 
 'Our new airport at Badgerys Creek will represent not just a major catalyst for investment...' 
 Where's the rest of it? 
 It's on the back. We're doing double-sided printing. 
 Why? 
 Because of No Paperil. 
 'Not just a major catalyst for investment and jobs gro... Western Sydney, but a permanent boost to the Australian economy.' 
 Yay! 
 Well done, everyo... inherited a project people have been trying to get up for 40 years. 
 And the NBA is one handover ceremony away from turning it into reality. 
 Woo! 
 Y... you'll excuse me, I have a very important lunch to go to. 
 (Cheering) 
 This feels good. I bet you thought this day would never come. 
 The Future Fund. How'd you get them on board? 
 I thought you'd like that. 
 They'll probably come on as part of a consortium. 
 So, not locked in? 
 Yeah, locked in. Just... accounting technicality. 
 Ooh, that doesn't sound good. 
 It is. 
 Waiter : Can I run through the specia... need. I'm gonna have the 500gm rib eye, medium rare, and rosemary potatoes. Jim? 
 Ah, just the salad. 
 And wine? 
 Yeah, sorry, can I just have one more minute? 
 Ah, yep. 
 You OK? 
 Fine. Yeah, good. Ooh. 
 'Subsoil profile problems.' 
 Finish the sentence. 
 Where is it? 
 On the back. We're doing double-sided printing. 
 '.. Can easily be addressed using existing landfill.' 
 Yeah. Oh. That's... hang on. 
 What's... what's this? 
 It's a spreadsheet. 
 Oh. Have we bitten off more than we can chew? 
 Jim, what's on your mind? 
 Jim? 
 (Sighs) 
 Can I run a hypothetical past you? 
 Sure. 
 Say the Australian Electoral Commission redrew a few boundaries in the area. 
 They did. 
 OK. Then say the airport's footprint impacted not two Federal electorates, but four or fi... does. 
 And say they were marginal seats. 
 They are. 
 And say the PM was, I dunno, struggling for a little support in the party room. 
 He is. 
 Then I wonder whether this is the time for projects that should be -- just for the moment -- shelved. 
 Are you still being hypothetical? 
 Not with that last word. 
 Waiter : Your champaign. 
 (Phone beeps) - KATIE: Nat? 
 Yes? 
 I've got Rhonda for you. 
 Ugh. Really? 
 Shall I tell her you're not in? 
 Rhonda : I'm already on the line! 
 Are you in conference mode? 
 Apparently. 
 Oh, I know what I've done. Anyway, it's Rhonda for you. 
 Yes, Rhonda. 
 Look, I'll be blunt -- looking at this bio, you're coming across as a little du... I? 
 I can't deny I've been thinking... 
 Oh, let's not bring Karsten in on this. 
 Morning, Natal... think you need a backstory. 
 A backstory? 
 Yeah. Are there any challenges you've had to overcome? 
 Personal illness, a death in the family? 
 No. 
 Are your parents separated? 
 Yes. 
 Great. 
 What? 
 Was that traumatic? 
 No, they get along well. 
 Oh, that's no good. 
 Were you bullied at school? 
 Maybe an eating disorder. 
 Were you a little fatty? 
 No! 
 Was there a teacher who said you'd never amount to anything, and hasn't Natalie Francesca Russell shown them now? 
 You know what? I'll have a think. 
 Yeah, could you, plea... that all? 
 The photo shoot. 
 What photo shoot? 
 Yeah. Would you like us to organise some wardrobe? 
 No, I'm OK. 
 What are you planning on wearing? 
 What I normally wear around the offi... will organise some wardrobe. 
 He's stopped pacing. 
 It's his rib eye. 
 I'll put it in the fridge. 
 Are you kidding me?! The can-do PM? Mr Conviction?! 
 He's just as disappointed as you are! 
 The project that could never get up! 
 Well, imagine how he fee... feels?! We spent six months on ... thought it'd take you two years. 
 No-one knew you'd go like a dog at a bone, leaving us with th... years of false starts and finally... 
 I hear ya. 
 Anyway, lesson learned. 
 What do we do? 
 Build it! 
 You're not listening. We can't build it! 
 Why not?! 
 Five marginal seats. 
 They've got a scare campaign up their sleeve, the Greens have got their tails up. We need your he... do what? 
 You know it so well. All the issues. 
 After eating, living, and breathing this for six months you want me to find a way to kill it?! 
 Could you? 
 YOU kill it! 
 How? We can't look like we're caving in to electoral pressure. 
 But you A... can't LOOK like it. 
 (Sighs) 
 Your... rib eye is in the fridge. 
 Uh, can I get you anything, or...? 
 No, I'm good, thanks, mate. 
 She should be here soon. Oh, Nat. 
 This is Lucas. Lucas, Nat. 
 I'm just gonna go change the filter. 
 Alright. 
 What's going on? 
 The photo shoot. 
 For the Women Of Influence conference. 
 I left a note on your desk. 
 Where? 
 Here. 
 Photographer, 9:15. 
 A scrap of paper? 
 Well, it's No Paperil. 
 You also got a messa... that what the red light's for? 
 Yep. And Rhonda wanted to know, do you have a photo of your pony? 
 I don't have a pony! 
 Tony : Hugh, is that you? 
 Y... last, the right extension. 
 Uh, no, I'm in Nat's office. 
 God. I need you in here. 
 Listen, I'm gonna go work in the boardroom. 
 Oh, hair and makeup. 8:45. 
 Tony : Can I give you guys a hypothetical? 
 Both : Sure. 
 Say someone got our report and they wanted to dismantle it. 
 Good luck. 
 Yeah, but, they want to find fault with our arguments. What would they do? 
 Give up? You could make it TWO slabs. 
 Hypothetically, what would you target? 
 Typos? 
 Yeah, apart from typos. 
 They won't find any now. 
 Oh, how was the ginger beer? 
 I'm saving it. 
 Financing? 
 No, we got that right. Low interest rate, Future Fund coming on board. 
 Traffic? 
 Are you kidding me? With that extra $500 million? 
 Gotta come up with somethi... this still a hypothetical? 
 Yep. 
 I understand that, I just think the initial funding agreement needs to include a reference to... 
 (Blowdrier starts) 
 I may have to call you back! 
 OK, thank you. Bye. 
 What was the name of that group that was against the airport, years ago? 
 The Government. 
 No. 
 But it WAS the Government. Then they changed their mind. 
 No, it was the protest group. 
 The Opposition? 
 They changed their mind, too. 
 They had banners and chants... 
 CFMEU? 
 No, it was a community group. 
 Save Badgerys Creek? 
 That's the one. 
 They used to have sit-ins and circulate big petitions... 
 I'll look them up. 
 I wonder whether we need to speak with them. 
 What f... see if they're planning anything big. 
 Another round of protests, to make sure we haven't missed anything. 
 Here we go. 'Save Badgerys Creek.' I've got their website. 
 What's it say? 
 'Page no longer found.' 
 Ah. 
 I'll keep looking. 
 Tony, is this really a hypothetical? 
 Ah... ye... (Sighs) I think I owe you guys a slab. 
 Amy : Another one? 
 Oh, no... 
 Please, go ahead. Everyone's right for drinks? 
 Uh, yes, thanks. 
 You certainly put in over the years, haven't you? 
 Are we still waiting on anyone? 
 No. I thought you were bringing the whole committee? 
 This is it, I'm afraid. 
 Oh, OK. Well, we've got a quorum. (Laughs) 
 I guess you're wondering why we asked you in here tod... were. 
 Well, strictly off the record, for the last six months we've been working on a report... 
 Into Badgerys Creek. 
 Yep, whether or not to proceed with the proje... heard it was a done de... did I... 
 Scotty. Not necessarily. 
 The PM has staked his leadership on ... was in the news. 
 Yep. Can I give you a hypothetical? Say the Government, for whatever reason, chose to... what's the word? 
 Backflip? 
 Not the word I'd use, Scotty. 
 U-turn. 
 Scotty. 
 Big fat 180. 
 Hypothetical! 
 OK, decided to reconsider the decision. How would you react? 
 We'd be surprised. 
 Yeah, but it might give you motivat... get out there again and let your feelings be known. 
 What feelings? 
 The... anti-airporty feelings? 
 You want us to start protesting again? 
 No, no, only if you want to. Free country. 
 I guess we'd pretty much given up. 
 Well, don't give up. 
 What if we gave up at Gallipoli? 
 We did. 
 Oh, yeah. Well, what's something we've just won? 
 A slab? 
 Yep, no. Um... America's Cup. 
 Imagine if Benny Lexcon had pulled a hamstring and shut his scrapbook.
