 A transformation future... 
 $8.5 billion for roads, rail and ports... 
 Infrastructure of the 21st century. 
 .. benefit future generations... 
 There's no future plan for Australia under this government! 
 .. major infrastructure projects... decisions for the long term... 
 We want to spend the money. 
 .. nation-building projects... 
 I want to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister. 
 Nation-building... 
 Nation-building... 
 It's very interesting, Anh, I hope we get to talk about it tonight. 
 Capacity utilisation is the key to infra... 
 It's key to, you know -- AirBnB -- the ride-sharing economy, in a way, is the same sort of issues of... 
 Do you know what I mean? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, well, that's the theory. 
 I have no idea what I'm gonna say. 
 Oh, you'll be fine. 
 Excuse me, gents, clear the studio. We're loading the audience. 
 That's easy for you. I don't know what I'm talking about. 
 Just be yourself, I reckon, is the key in these situations, Anh. 
 We'll cover a lot of topics, so... 
 How funny is Anh Do? 
 He was so funny! 
 Oh! Here he is! Yay! 
 Oh, come on now. 
 You were great last night, Tony. 
 Just making up the numbers, Amy. 
 So handsome in that suit! 
 Thank you. 
 Did you get to meet Tony Jones? 
 Yep, well, he hosts the show. 
 Oh, but afterwards. 
 Ah, quick chat. 
 He didn't let you say much. 
 I thought I got a few points across. 
 Did ya? 
 Yeah. 
 I was flicking around. 
 That Pakistani man kept interrupting you. 
 He's from Bangladesh. 
 Oh. 
 Why didn't the audience applaud your answers? 
 They did a bit. 
 Not like the others. 
 Yeah, well... 
 I guess I was explaining some pretty dry policy concepts. 
 Can you see the tweets as they come up on the screen? 
 Not while you're on air. 
 Oh, good. 
 What do you mean good? 
 Um... 
 Were they saying I was being a bit dry? 
 No... more boring. 
 How funny is Anh Do? 
 I thought you were flicking around? 
 I saw bits. 
 Yep. 
 What, all of them? 
 No, not all! 
 OK. (Chuckles) 
 Just the ones about you. 
 Nation Builders! 
 Hi, Jim. 
 Nat, any idea who our freedom-of-information officer is? 
 Um... no. 
 Any chance you could find out? 
 Is there a problem? 
 Nah, just had a few requests come in to the minister. 
 About us? I - guess so. 
 Who are they from? 
 Don't know. 
 What are they asking for? 
 Not sure but he'd like it dealt with. Can I leave it with ya? 
 Here he is! Here he is! 
 Ah, ha, ha! 
 Our TV star! 
 Ah, what ya think? 
 Ah, I didn't see it, I was at a fundraising dinner. 
 How'd you go? 
 Ah, fine, yeah. 
 You get a few laughs? 
 Ah, it was more about explaining broad policy settings. 
 Yeah, I heard you were a bit dry. Anh Do would've killed it! 
 Yeah. Nah, he did. 
 Can I give you a bit of a heads up? 
 PM was on drive radio yesterday. 
 Ah, who's that knob-head in Sydney? 
 Er, big field. 
 Yeah, anyway, he was asking about priorities, usual guff, kept pushing, so the PM floated this idea of 'education nation'. 
 What's education nation? 
 Oh, I skipped a step. 
 Something a couple in cabinet have been playing with, trying to turn things around a bit. See Monday's polls? 
 I did. 
 Urgh. 
 Probably a bit premature but the reaction was amazing. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, full board of calls, had to cancel the talkback vet. 
 Long story short, he wants to bring you guys in on it. 
 Education? 
 Social capital. 
 Classic nation building. 
 Yeah, not really our area. 
 Hey, don't talk yourself down. You had one bad night on telly. 
 I thought you hadn't seen it. 
 Oh, just a bit on iView. 
 Can you read the comments at the bottom of the screen? 
 No, not while you're on air. 
 Yeah, no, good. 
 So, can I tell him you're on board? 
 Yeah. Well, we'll have a look. 
 Great. 
 Yep. 
 What does 'FFS' stand for? 
 Don't know. 
 Yeah. You got a few of those. 
 Right. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, for f*ck's sake. 
 Nat : Hugh, do you know who our FOI officer is? 
 Um, yeah, sorry, let me think. 
 Do you know what an FOI officer is? 
 No. 
 Freedom-of-information. 
 Obviously not you. Scotty? 
 Yep? 
 Are you our FOI officer? 
 I think I'm privacy officer... Or is it diversity? 
 I'm definitely first aid warden. 
 Who wants to know? 
 Jim. So, how do we find out? 
 We could put in a freedom-of-information request. 
 I don't think so. 
 Yeah, who would we give it to? 
 V/O : Education's a great equaliser, it sets people up for life. That's a good thing we may get a university in the top 20. Today we're looking at schools... This is significant. It will have an impact on so many people. 
 Morning, Tony! 
 Amy. 
 Sir, if I could get you over here. 
 Have you met Brian? 
 No. Hi, Brian. 
 This is Tony, our CEO. 
 I just need to check your pass. 
 She knows who I am. 
 New protocol, sir. 
 Because we're doing work on the submarines... 
 I'll stop you there miss... 
 Yep, no, I get it, submarines. 
 Just put his name there. 
 And reason for visit? 
 Well, it's not really a visit. 
 It's just a category, sir. 
 I work here. 
 OK, put visiting for work... And representing? 
 I'm the CEO. 
 Put 'self'. 
 Right, you're good to go. 
 Thanks, Tony! 
 OK, thanks, Amy. 
 Make sure he signs out when he leaves. 
 Was he on telly the other night? 
 Oh, Q&A! 
 How funny was that Anh Do? 
 I know! 
 Time? 
 Oh. 
 Tony : I get that, but what's he doing there? 
 There's been a security upgrade now that we're dealing with defence contractors. 
 Those bloody submarines. 
 We could be a target for terrorism. 
 We're not building them. What are they gonna do, take our spreadsheets hostage? 
 Oh, yeah, this gift box just arrived from ABC. 
 There's almost nothing in it. 
 I don't think they're allowed to endorse products. 
 There's a card, a DVD of Midsomer Murders... 
 Season nine. 
 .. and a copy of Anh Do's book. 
 Great. 
 He was so funny. 
 Yeah! 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Yep. 
 Do you know this gentleman? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Can you make sure you have the correct lanyard next time? 
 No worries. 
 And sign out when you leave. 
 Sorry about that, Jim, it's because of the submarines. 
 Yeah, well, that'll stop. 
 What? 
 Did I not tell you about it? 
 No! 
 Anyway. Happier stories. What did I say? Sydney Morning Herald. 
 Take a look. 
 'Smart Move'. What's it about? 
 Keep going! 
 (Reads) The Prime Minister's announcements for a major education reform have certainly struck a chord. 
 Two editorials, an opinion piece. The thing's getting real traction. 
 What exactly is this thing? 
 I knew you'd ask that. 
 Education Nation. 
 A complete, once-in-a-generation reform of our pre-, primary and secondary school system. 
 Wow, that's huge. 
 Reads well, doesn't it? 
 Yeah, it does. 
 But before the big fella pulls the trigger, we wondered if you could cast an eye over it. 
 How do you mean? 
 As we said, we were hoping -- or the PM was hoping -- you and the team could put a bit of flesh on the bone. 
 Again, we could have a look at it. 
 Yeah, good man. 
 Just give us everything you've got. 
 You've got it. 
 No, I mean in terms of policy frameworks and departmental briefings and... research papers. 
 You're kidding me? 
 No. 
 That's it. 
 Yeah. 
 How funny's this bloke? 
 Nat, I found out who the freedom-of-information officer is. 
 Yeah? 
 It's you. 
 Me? 
 Yeah, congratulations. 
 Thanks. 
 Who's made the request? 
 I haven't even looked. 
 Um... Nicola Vlahos? 
 Who's she? 
 Journo, by the looks of things. 
 Fin Review. 
 What's she asking for? 
 Documents relating to the tendering process for the Perth Airport upgrade. 
 That was last year. 
 Yep. 
 So what do we do now? 
 I don't know. 
 Shall I look it up on YouTube? 
 Why would you look it up on YouTube? 
 That's what I do for first aid tips. 
 Step one is we have to source the documents. 
 I think they're in there. 
 Sourced. 
 Step two? 
 Get out the documents. 
 OK. Is there a step three? 
 That's it?! 
 We came up with the idea! 
 You've come up with a slogan! 
 A good one! 
 We've got it in the papers, now we just need to put a bit of flesh on the bone! 
 Flesh?! What bone?! 
 This is an opportunity! 
 It's insane! 
 Is everything OK? 
 Ah yep. 
 Heard some raised voices. 
 It was him. 
 Yeah, agitated. 
 Is that Anh Do's book? 
 Yeah! 
 Funny bloke. 
 How good was he last night? 
 You can iView it. 
 You've announced a policy without having any idea what it actually is! 
 We didn't realise it'd strike a chord, we've been blown away. 
 Gotta put a stop to this. 
 The reaction's been so positive! 
 No! Put a stop to policy on the run! The very point I made on Q&A! 
 Did you? It must've been towards the end. 
 Who wrote this? 
 My PA! 
 Based on what? 
 That meeting -- I told you we had that meeting! 
 One meeting? 
 I've got some notes. 
 Here we go -- multidimensional vertical integration, meeting the challenges... 
 Such as? 
 Well, there's your first challenge. 
 Oh, Jim. 
 Multidisciplinary student focus, bringing together the best acrylic... 
 What? 
 That might have been auto-corrected. 
 Let's not forget, schools of this country's funeral. 
 Actually, that should say 'future'. 
 Jim! 
 This is the first good news we've had in months. 
 We had to get cracking! This is a... once-in-a-generation opportunity. 
 For what? 
 Er... I could ring my PA. 
 Jim! 
 You're good at this stuff. 
 Big picture thinking. We're not asking for a complete policy. 
 Really? 
 Well, it'd be nice. 
 Just some bullet points. 
 Jim. Three. 
 There's just so many reports on education. 
 I know, but print 'em all out, we gotta start somewhere. 
 I watched it again on iView. 
 I reckon Tony Jones had it in for ya. 
 Scotty, let's move on. 
 Just 'cause you waffled a bit. 
 I didn't waffle. 
 According to the tweets... 
 What tweet? 
 You're right, let it go. 
 Sorry to interrupt -- have a situation at the front desk. 
 What's happened? Some woman claiming she needs to see you. 
 Refuses to sign in or give reason for visit. 
 Who is she? A Rhonda. 
 No idea. Send her away. 
 Tony! Yes, she works here. 
 I will never have that chance ever again. 
 Who's that? 
 Brian. He's here to protect us. 
 Hmm, where was he during Q&A? God, those tweets. 
 Anyway, put it behind you. 
 Now, Education Nation. 
 What about it? 
 Jim mentioned you had three bullet points. 
 Half an hour ago? 
 Well? 
 Rhonda, I've barely had time to read the press release. 
 Every media outlet in the country's begging me for detail. 
 See The Drum last night? 
 No. 
 Half the show on it. 
 On Education Nation? They don't know what it is. 
 That didn't stop them. Get this -- Q&A want to do education reform as a topic next week. 
 Rhonda... 
 Not you. Don't worry they won't make that mistake again. 
 Now, what have you got for me? 
 I've just been asked to come up with a complete reform of our national education system. 
 Yes. 
 Half an hour ago. 
 And I want my three bullet points, please. 
 Where is Nat? 
 Him Rhonda. 
 Jim tells me we've had an FOI request. 
 Yes. 
 OK, have you dealt with one of these before? 
 No. 
 It's quite straightforward. 
 Grab a pen. To these ones you simply reply, 'We reject this application on the following grounds: Firstly, the number of documents requested is far too voluminous. Secondly...' 
 You've stopped writing. 
 Yeah, it's just... 
 'Secondly, sourcing said documents would constitute an unreasonable burden on the office in terms of time and resources.' - But it won't. 
 What? 
 Rhonda, have you actually read the request? 
 No. 
 Has the minister? 
 I wouldn't have thought so. 
 Am I missing something? 
 Clearly. 
 That's it. Firm hand. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Breathe. 
 Yeah. 
 Double tap. 
 That's dead. 
 Scotty? 
 Meeting. 
 Yeah. Thanks, Brian. 
 Sorry, I was just... talking to Brian. 
 Did you know he was almost SAS? 
 Oh, wow. 
 Almost? 
 He's not allowed to discuss it. 
 I just saw him discussing it with you. 
 I've said too much. 
 What's SAS? 
 Special Air Service. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Almost! 
 Right, let's get on with it, beginning with what we know. 
 Education Nation is a Federal Government initiative. 
 Right. 
 It's about education. 
 A once-in-a-generation... 
 Stop quoting from the press release. 
 I think it's the next bit. 
 'Education Nation is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to...' 
 Dot, dot, dot. 
 That's the tricky part. 
 Hence the meeting. 
 Tony, I've got someone from the School Principals Association on the line. 
 How did they know to ring here? 
 I think Jim referred them to us. 
 Again! 
 Can you just say we'll get back to them? 
 Haven't finished yet. The Teachers Federation want a meeting and that person from the Australian Education Union rang again. 
 They really, REALLY want a meeting. 
 What for? 
 They want to know what we're planning. 
 See if you can put them off. 
 Frankly, they'd have more ideas about this than we do. 
 You thinking what I'm thinking? 
 About Q&A? 
 No. 
 Katie? Can you get a list of all those callers for me? 
 Now I'm confused. 
 OK, this is a freedom-of-information request. 
 Yes. 
 Don't we have to respond? 
 Yes. 
 And our response will be to refuse it. 
 On what grounds? 
 I just gave them to you. 
 The number of files is not voluminous and it won't take valuable... 
 Alright, choose another ground. 
 'We have conducted a thorough and exhaustive search and cannot find any of the documents listed.' 
 I've got them here. 
 You're making this very difficult! 
 What if there's nothing to worry about? 
 We don't know that. 
 It's just a car park. 
 I'm sure there's nothing to hide. 
 That's for the minister to decide. 
 But he hasn't read the request. 
 All the more reason to block it. 
 Pen. 
 'The documents are exempt for the following reasons...' Write it down. 
 'They touch on commercial in confidence, they contain private ministerial briefings...' 
 V/O : This is a major change. Good education is something governments ought to be improving. I'm incredibly excited by the work we do. 
 
 
 
 Great. Yeah, good that you could make it in. 
 Thanks for fitting us in. 
 Yeah, not a problem. That's... 
 Brian, do they really need to wear those big visitor passes? 
 They can take them off for the meeting. 
 OK, great. 
 It's a restricted zone but... I'll put 'em with your phones. 
 That's great, Brian. 
 Can you make sure they sign... 
 Sign out? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks, Brian. 
 So... Education Nation. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I can tell you, there were a few noses out of joint when we heard you'd developed an entire policy framework without our input. 
 Yeah, I can imagine. It was more a timing issue. 
 We had to do a lot of the early prep work sort of in camera. 
 We haven't heard many details. 
 I sense you're sitting on a lot more than you're letting on. 
 To an extent. 
 Shall I show them this? 
 They've read the press release. 
 Could you give us some idea of what you're planning? 
 Yep, we can. Yes. Er, before I do that, can I ask you a question? 
 Of course. 
 What would you like us to plan? 
 Oh! Well, there's a lot of issues that we need to get through. 
 Great. 
 First of all... but with a clear emphasis on the importance of retaining experienced teaching staff. 
 Right. 
 Ah... should I keep going? 
 Yes, yes, please. Yep. 
 Is this along the lines of what you're planning? 
 I think there'll be an overlap. 
 So, STEM teaching... 
 STEM teaching, which of course stands for Science... Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. 
 Of course. STEM. 
 Yes. 
 OK, thank you. 
 Nat? I spoke to the minister's office about the FOI request. 
 Oh, thank you. I asked his chief of staff why they wanted it blocked. 
 And? 
 No-one can remember. 
 The reason? 
 Or the project. 
 It's the airport upgrade. 
 I told them that. 
 And? 
 It rang a bell. They said it's probably safer just to block it. 
 I know that! The question is how? 
 Shall I get Rhonda back? 
 Um... could you have a look at it? 
 At what? 
 This. 
 Yep, this, sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you, thanks... 
 They don't need to put on their visitor passes again... 
 You would have seen that paper. 
 Oh, absolutely, yeah. That paper. 
 There's a link on the School Principals Association website. 
 These guys are all over... 
 Is that.org or.edu? edu. 
 Well, thanks again for your time. 
 Oh, no, thank you. Feels like we did all the talking. 
 Nah! It's good to hear it all again, you know, you hear it so many times. 
 I'm still not clear... 
 Might have to keep going... 
 Thanks again. 
 Sign out... 
 Give them back their phones too. 
 And the little nail scissors that you took off the lady... 
 They were good. 
 Yeah, they're all good. 
 I just don't know what we're gonna do with it all. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, class sizes. 
 Too big. 
 He said they don't matter. 
 Teacher pay. 
 Should be lifted. 
 Only if it's linked to performance. 
 Private schools. 
 Big problem. 
 No, they're not. 
 You picking up a theme? 
 Nup. 
 Tell me one thing they all agreed on. 
 They all want reform. 
 What else? 
 They all like the muffins. 
 Now you understand what I'm trying to say? 
 Nup. See, this is what happened on Q&A. 
 Can we just drop Q&A for a second? 
 V/O : Independent school funding comes from the Federal Government. Every child that wants to go on to university... You have to understand that children are very different... 
 Once your assailant's arms are pinned, feet wide apart, he -- or she -- is effectively immobilised. 
 Wow. 
 I think I need to get the phone. 
 Hello, Nation Building Australia, Amy speaking. 
 Thanks, Brian. 
 Happy to help. 
 Brian, my door's locked. 
 Yeah. 
 Because? 
 You're dealing with an FOI request. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Sensitive documents. 
 Yeah, they're actually on Hugh's desk. 
 Let's get those files inside. 
 Just through here, sir. Don't forget to fill out reason for visit on your way out. 
 No worries. 
 OK. 
 Actually, you can leave the door open. 
 (Door slams) 
 How's it going? 
 It's tricky. 
 Really? 
 There's a whole bunch of priorities just about everybody agrees on. 
 This is sounding good. 
 Nobody agrees on what to do about them. 
 That's OK. We've got the word 'priority'. Let's start with that. 
 We're gonna need more time. 
 Ah. 
 What do you mean, 'Ah'? 
 PM's addressing the Press Club next Monday I was hoping to run Education Nation up the flagpole. 
 Monday? 
 We've nothing concrete. 
 It just needs a couple of thought bubbles, maybe a priority? 
 We can give you what we've got so far. 
 Fire away. 
 Here's what everyone agrees are the top 10 priorities. 
 Good word, 'priority'. 
 Number one... 
 Early childhood education for those on the margins. 
 Yeah, I think that's been done. 
 It hasn't been done. 
 Number two? 
 OK, well, this is huge. 
 Maths and sciences, especially for girls. 
 What's three? 
 Truancy rates. 
 Feels narrow. Anything else? 
 Once-in-a-generation opportunity? 
 Truancy rates are a huge issue. 
 What's four? 
 PISA scores. 
 Alright, let's go the other way. What's 10? 
 You wanted us to identify the priorities. 
 Where's the big-picture thinking? What about meeting the challenges? 
 That's just a slogan. 
 A good one. 
 Like Super Schools. 
 What's a Super School? 
 They don't exist. 
 Well, there's your problem, let's build some. 
 Jim... 
 It sounds like a priority to me. 
 You do realise that at some point we actually have to announce a policy? 
 What do you mean? 
 The 'dot, dot, dot' bit. 
 OK, I did some research. FOI. Freedom-of-information. 
 I know what it is. 
 Sorry. 
 You got the Act? 
 And the guidelines and amendments. 
 And...? 
 There's not much we can use. 
 What?! In all of that? 
 Well, we can refuse a request if any documents relate to national security. 
 A multi-storey carpark? 
 Yeah, I didn't think so. 
 Mind you, it's an airport. 
 Next to an airport. 
 Um, were any of the documents intended for cabinet? 
 I don't think so. 
 We could ask the minister. 
 I don't think he'll remember. 
 Are they cabinet briefing documents? 
 No. 
 Do any documents contain the word 'cabinet'? 
 What else? 
 Ah... are they commercial in confidence? 
 We're doing publicly listed companies. 
 Contain personal information? 
 All she wants is a set of absolutely standard contracts relating to a multi-storey carpark that was finished a year ago. 
 Give YouTube another try? 
 I'll speak to someone from legal. 
 Our PM, Press Club, Education Nation. 
 I meant to see it. What did he say? 
 Yeah, it was a good opening. 
 'Ladies and gentlemen, this nation sits poised at the crossroads. 
 We can either drift with the status quo or face the challenges of this once-in-a-generation...' 
 Yeah. that's from the press release again. 
 But then he got down to business after that. Mentioned a couple of your priorities. 
 Oh yeah? PISA scores? 
 Nah, felt the room. 
 STEM? 
 You know the one they loved? 
 Truancy rates? 
 Super Schools. 
 He said that out loud? 
 You bet. 
 At the Press Club? 
 Very positive response. 
 No-one in that room knows what a Super School is. 
 That's what we worked out. 
 That's the beauty of it. That's what Education Nation is. 
 What, something you can't work out? 
 Exactly! 
 Because the moment you start getting specific... 
 You start creating a policy! 
 .. you start getting disagreements! 
 That's not a discovery! I reckon we pull back on this. 
 Pull back?! The Opposition has offered conditional bipartisan support. 
 Conditional on what?! 
 That we eventually tell them what we're planning. 
 This is nuts! 
 Come on! They're right behind it. 
 Katie, I'm expecting Theo. Can you find out what's... 
 Who? 
 Theo... Our legal officer. 
 Oh! Is that who he was? 
 What do you mean 'was'? 
 Brian sent him away. 
 What? 
 He wasn't on the visitors list. 
 I'll speak to Amy. Oh -- purpose of visit? 
 Jim, we've got to start making progress on this thing. 
 Hey, hey, hey! We had another kitchen cabinet after the Press Club and we think we may have come up with a way that we can move Education Nation a step further. 
 OK, great. 
 How's this for the makings of a good announcement? 
 Let's hear it. 
 From 26 January next year... 
 Nice... 
 every child in the Commonwealth of Australia... 
 Yeah?.. 
 will be guaranteed over the life of their school years... 
 Yeah? 
 That's it. 
 What? 
 Oh, sorry. Dot, dot, dot. 
 I thought you said you had an announcement. 
 I said we had the makings of an announcement! 
 Do you want me to send you this? 
 Thanks for coming back. 
 No problem. 
 Sorry about the mixup. 
 It's OK. 
 Katie, what's with the massive lanyard? 
 Oh, Brian. 
 Katie, the pod's locked. 
 Brian. 
 'Cause you left your FOI stuff in there. 
 Where is Brian? 
 Getting a coffee. 
 It's alright, I've got the key. 
 This FOI request. 
 The good news is as a government authority, you can apply for an extension. 
 Push the whole thing back six months. 
 Right. But then...? 
 Extend again. 
 Yeah, but eventually...? 
 I guess it depends on the nature of the documents requested. 
 Have you not read them? 
 No... Should I? 
 Tony : Yes, but I don't know why I have to show it to Brian every time I walk in. 
 Because of the submarines. 
 That doesn't make... Sorry, why are my blinds down? 
 Brian. He thinks someone from another building might see your computer and take a screenshot. 
 Of our logo? I think we can take that risk. 
 Here he is. 
 Hello! 
 Ah, see the news poll this morning? 
 Yes, I did! 
 Seven points! 
 Yeah, that's 'cause of a lot of things. 
 Nah. It's Education Nation. 
 They don't know that. 
 Media Monitors do. 
 Hence the smiles. 
 Listen to this -- 5AA Adelaide this morning. 
 God. 
 Host : 'We're talking about the Education Nation proposal. Julie from Hindmarsh, you've got a comment.' 
 Julie : 'Yes, Leon, as a parent, I am just so excited by this initiative.' 
 Julie doesn't know what... 
 Shh! 
 Host : 'I agree, Julie.' 
 Julie : 'It's about our kids and their future.' 
 Host : 'Too right, Julie. Time for a traffic update.' 
 Oh, that's the end. I've got 30 more like it. 
 This thing's a winner. 
 Same across the country. 
 One other thing keeps coming up, I thought you could use it. 
 That we're falling behind China. 
 Yeah, I didn't know that. 
 In what? 
 Not sure. Maths, I wanna say... music? 
 Probably be... 
 Whichever. Point is, kids in Shanghai, way ahead of us. 
 Wait a second -- we're crowdsourcing ideas from talkback radio? 
 What's wrong with that? 
 It's called democracy, Tony. 
 Listening to the people. Besides... I've yet to hear a decent idea from you. 
 Oh, he came up with Super Schools. 
 My apologies. 
 Yeah, I agree. Nothing leaping out. 
 Commercial in confidence? 
 No. 
 Cabinet briefing? 
 No. 
 Voluminous request, could divert resources... 
 It took us ten minutes to find them. 
 Wow. 
 Guess there's only one thing we can do. 
 Release them? 
 Redact them. 
 Redact? 
 Yeah, block out the sensitive information. 
 It's within the Act. 
 Let's see what we've got. Are these copies? 
 Yes. 
 Date of project. 
 I think we lose that. 
 Name of project. Hmm, could be a little sensitive. 
 What's that? 
 The carpark's location. 
 Ah, I don't think so. 
 It's been open for a year. 
 Just to be on the safe side. 
 Critical this is we keep shaping the message. 
 No-one knows what the message is! 
 Even more critical then. 
 Hmm. 
 So, where are we at? 
 Nowhere. 
 What do you mean nowhere? 
 Sorry, nowhere, dot, dot, dot. 
 You've had a week! 
 Let's see what Karsten's come up with. 
 When did Karsten get involved? 
 Did I not tell you that? 
 Just keep your hands there, we'll get along fine. 
 Oh, um, it's OK, Brian, it's Karsten! 
 Yeah, OK, well, what's in the tubes? 
 Ah... materials. 
 Right, just get you to open one of them, slowly, for me. 
 Ah, yep. 
 Move... are you moving slowly? 
 Yep, very slowly. 
 Stand back, Amy. 
 Oh. 
 Should be fine. 
 (Air release) 
 Ooh. 
 It's just a sound. 
 Now, I've gone through all of the materials. 
 You mean the press release? 
 And I've managed to come up with a few thought starters. 
 Memories. Slates. The times tables. The three Rs. 
 (Softly) Yep. 
 The digital age. Screens. Super Schools. 
 Our virtual future. 
 (Softly) Yep. 
 Education Nation. 
 It's you. It's me. 
 It's... 
 It's what? 
 Dot, dot, dot. 
 I was told that you were gonna finish that. 
 Wonderful job, Karsten. 
 Namaste. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Tony, you've had a week to complete one sentence. 
 Look what Karsten's come up with in a day. 
 A media strategy and some slogans? 
 Yes! And? 
 We still don't have an actual policy. 
 I don't think we do another thing until someone comes up with an actual policy. 
 So the ad's on hold? 
 What ad? 
 Is my PA not CC-ing you? 
 AD voicover : From broad skills to broadband. 
 From schools of the air to schools of the future. 
 A world where classrooms have no walls and learning knows no limits. 
 Education Nation. 
 Because every child deserves the chance to soar. 
 Wow. 
 Yep, but at some point we're actually gonna have to announce something concrete. 
 Really? 
 People aren't stupid. 
 Yeah, cabinet's starting to ask questions. 
 Alright, well, let's have a look at what we've got in the bank. 
 Education Nation. 
 Tony's Super Schools idea. 
 A press release and a slogan... 
 And we're falling behind China. 
 .. with a hint of xenophobia. 
 It's a good start. 
 Nat? Those redacted documents you wanted? 
 Yep. 
 I've only been able to print half. 
 Why? 
 Well, we ran out of toner. 
 There's a delivery coming this afternoon. 
 OK. 
 We all agree that Education Nation is a wonderful concept. 
 Yeah, absolutely. Did you see that Galaxy poll this morning? 
 I did. 
 Yeah, PM's approval up another three. 
 But we just can't afford to get bogged down in detail. 
 What do you normally do in these situations? 
 Palm it off to you? 
 What? 
 That clearly hasn't worked. 
 I came up with ten priorities. 
 Again, detail. 
 Could we commission a report? 
 What for? 
 To buy us a few months. 
 OK. 
 But what about a proper, extensive report. 
 Six months? 
 Is that...? I mean, seriously. 
 A real report. 
 Nine? 
 Is that all? 
 Headed by an eminent Australian. 
 Ooh, this is sounding better. 
 OK, a wide-ranging, thorough report benchmarked against international best practice. 
 Overseas travel. We're talking at least two years. 
 That should be enough. 
 OK. 
 Well, then, Education Nation begins with a report. 
 A landmark study, an inter-generational blueprint for the future. 
 Brilliant. 
 In order to... 
 Yeah? 
 What? 
 Oh, Nat, I just got a call from the minister's office. 
 His chief of staff actually read the FOI request. 
 And? 
 Well that project finished on time and under budget. 
 I know. 
 Well, he's rapt. They want to get the documents out there. 
 What? 
 He's happy for them to be released provided it's not too voluminous. 
 Hugh! I've spent the last three weeks coming up with reasons to block that request. 
 How are we going to suddenly now 'get them out there'? 
 We could leak them? 
 Do you know a journo? 
 Um... I know one. 
 On two. One, two. 
 Pff! Pff! He's dead. Next target. 
 Katie. 
 Pff! Pff! 
 Clean. Next. 
 Go, move. 
 Hustle. 
 Remember your training. 
 Smoke grenade. 
 He's dead.
