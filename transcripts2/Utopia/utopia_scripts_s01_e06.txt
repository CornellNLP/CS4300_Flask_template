 Man : This is a nation-building project... 
 Man : New infrastructure of the 21st century... 
 Woman : If there is a buzzword in this budget, it's 'nation-building'... 
 Man : Major infrastructure projects right around the country... 
 Man : Transformational vision for the infrastructure of the 21st century... 
 Man : I want to be known as the infrastructure prime minister... 
 Woman : Nation-building budget... 
 Man : Nation-building for recovery... 
 Woman : Nation-building program... 
 Man : Nation-building. 
 That should now say 'installation successful'. 
 Man : It's just a coloured wheel going round and round. 
 Yeah, shouldn't be doing that. 
 Why am I loading this? 
 So you can use our new printer. 
 We have to install the driver. 
 Why have we got a new printer? 
 So we can all print from the one location. 
 Wasn't the old system working? 
 Yes, but we also had money in the budget, and this is going to save so much time. 
 Well, it's already taken 20 minutes and my computer's frozen, so we're not off to a great start. 
 I'll get Hugh to take a look at it. 
 Yeah. 
 Man : Morning, all! 
 Hi, Jim. 
 Don't think it's gonna stop. 
 Tassie. 
 Little island south of... 
 Yeah, I know where it is, but you're pointing towards Broome. 
 Am I? 
 Yeah. 
 It came up the other day. 
 Its existence or its location? 
 No, no, it came up in Cabinet. 
 It was pointed out their funding allocations have been a little mainland-focused. 
 We sort of forget about Tassie. 
 Just wondering if we can push anything their way. 
 Yeah, I'd have to look into it. 
 Why don't you have a chat with the Hobart office? 
 Don't have a Hobart office. 
 Oh. Well, set one up. 
 How about we get a project first, then set up a Hobart office? 
 Great. There's two ideas right away. 
 Might take an early lunch. 
 I don't understand. 
 Why do we have to do anything? 
 Because we still have money in the budget for professional development, and we need to use it. 
 And if we don't? 
 I think that sends the wrong signal. 
 That we're not wasting money? 
 That we don't care about professional development. 
 Alright. What are the options? 
 A conference. 
 Yeah, on what? 
 Well, depends where we go. 
 We can send two people to Bali or the entire office to Adelaide. 
 What's that place with all the trampolines? 
 Scott, how can bouncing be classified as professional development? 
 If you do it in teams? 
 Or we could do an in-service - bring someone into the office. 
 For how long? 
 However long it takes for us all to reach that next level. 
 So, have we ruled out Adelaide? 
 Yes. 
 And the trampolines? 
 Jim : You should head down there. 
 Now you're pointing to Brisbane. 
 Catch up with some of the locals, brainstorm some ideas, find out what they want built, and go from there. 
 They may not want us to build anything. 
 Of course they will. 
 What else could they want? 
 I don't know - investment in healthcare, the Bass Strait bridge. 
 A bridge? 
 No, no, not a bridge. 
 You said a bridge. 
 I didn't mean a literal bridge. 
 Oh, well, let's not rule it out. 
 It's a passenger and freight equalisation scheme in order to compensate Tasmanians for the added cost of shipping across Bass Strait... 
 So, it's not a real bridge? 
 No. 
 A tunnel? 
 No! 
 Under Bass Strait. 
 It could be like the aquarium. 
 You could drive your car through and sharks could come... 
 Jim, Tasmanians do not need a tunnel or a bridge. 
 (Sighs) There must be something they want knocked up. 
 See, this is the problem. 
 We go in there and enforce our will on the States, instead of listening. 
 We need to be more consultative. 
 Don't tell them, ask them! 
 What they want built? 
 What they WANT. 
 Built. 
 Jim. 
 OK, let's do it. Let's be more... 
 Consultative. 
 Alright, head down there, sniff the wind. 
 That's Perth. 
 Whatever. Find out what they want. 
 And then we can build it. 
 Are you OK, Tony? 
 To be honest, Katie, I'm wondering whether I should just quit. 
 Good idea. Let's force quit. 
 You might lose the printer drive, though. 
 (Mouse clicks) 
 It says, 'Printer drive not responding. Error code 0017.' 
 OK, you need to go into Preferences, Page Set-up, then check the box that says 'default settings'. 
 It won't open. 
 Did you hit "save changes"? 
 You didn't say, 'Hit "save changes."' 
 OK, Preferences... 
 I'll print it downstairs. 
 Have you got a moment for me to show you something? 
 Sure. 
 On my computer. 
 Can't you print it out? 
 Printer's offline. 
 Right. 
 Who is he? 
 Marvin Hudfield. 
 A world leader in organisational design and people effectiveness strategies. 
 He's coming here. 
 What for? 
 For us - professional development. 
 I thought we were looking at a conference. 
 Rhonda thought this would be more bang for buck. 
 She said conferences were often a waste of time. 
 Has anyone seen this guy? 
 Rhonda has, in Bali. 
 Really? 
 Look - he's featured in the New York Times. 
 New York Post. 
 Still New York. 
 And he's helped dozens of blue chip companies. 
 Have you ever heard of Milwaukee Data Systems? 
 No. How long's he here for? 
 Just a week. 
 A week? 
 That's your E-ticket receipt, hotel details. 
 Why is half the page missing? 
 Oh, don't tell me the printer's gone wrong again. 
 Something about US letterhead. 
 The other half's on the back. 
 Got it. 
 OK, we've got the town hall booked in Hobart for the first session, and then we've got Launceston on Monday. 
 We couldn't just make it one meeting? 
 With people from Hobart and Launceston? 
 Yeah. 
 In the one room? 
 It's not the Middle East! 
 Sort of. 
 Alright, we'll have two community consultations. 
 Three. 
 We've also got the town of Ross. 
 It's halfway between Hobart and Launceston for people that refuse to visit either place. 
 How do we get there? 
 I've booked a limo. 
 A limo?! 
 Travel budget. 
 We have to spend it by the 30th. 
 OK. 
 OK? 
 I reckon the key tonight is we canvas a range of suggestions. 
 We don't want to just hear from narrow interest groups. 
 Got it! 
 OK. 
 What time does the meeting start? 
 Er, according to my agenda, the doors open at, um... 
 (Button clicks) 
 (Sighs) 
 I need my charger again. 
 OK, um... 
 Where's the plug? 
 Upstairs. 
 I didn't bring your charger. 
 Oh, you're kidding me. 
 It's in your hotel room. 
 Is that the fat plug or the thin plug? 
 No, thin one. 
 Thin plug. I've got a fat one. 
 Can I get you to initial this expense account, 'cause Tony's not here? 
 What's it for? 
 Marvin. 
 Accommodation, per diems, and materials. 
 Why would he need PVC piping? 
 Not sure. I think it might be for a team building exercise. 
 Oh, God! No. 
 Well, I'm sure he knows what he's doing. 
 Sorry, folks. We might make a start. 
 (Microphone distorts) 
 Just introduce myself. 
 Tony, Scott. We're both... 
 I'm Scott. 
 Yep, and this is Katie, who's on the floor with the microphone. 
 We're all from National Building Authority, and I'd just like to say what a great thing it is to see so many people out here on such a miserable night. 
 Well, not miserable - bracing. 
 Oh, it's pretty bad. 
 Yeah, but a lot of places have bad weather. 
 No, this is bad down here... 
 Yeah, OK. 
 What we hope to hear from you tonight is your number one priorities - the sort of infrastructure needs that you could see being rolled out... 
 Just hold on a second. 
 I'll just explain a little more. 
 The sort of infrastructure needs you could see rolled out state-wide. 
 So, nothing is too big picture, but the key tonight is, 'Is it a problem and can it be fixed?' 
 OK, so, yes, yes, the lady about fourth row back, yes. 
 Wait till you get the microphone, yeah. 
 Our blue recycle bins are only collected fortnightly. 
 Yeah, definitely a problem. 
 Probably a council matter, though. 
 But thank you. 
 Let's keep it big picture. 
 Yes, the gentleman right across here, Katie. Yep. Thanks, Katie. 
 Can I raise dangerous dogs? 
 Again, I said big picture. 
 It needs to be infrastructure. 
 It involves a fence. 
 Yep, still probably the council level. 
 Alright. 
 Yes, the gentleman on the end. 
 Thanks. As a resident... 
 Yep, just the microphone up, Katie. 
 (Booms) As a resident... 
 Too far. There's a sweet spot. 
 As a resident of Hobart... 
 That's it! That's the sweet spot. 
 ..I'd like to know when we expect to get a fair go from the mainland in terms of road funding. 
 (Applause) 
 We keep hearing all these promises, but nothing seems to happen. 
 I mean, the roads are appalling! 
 You've got these logging trucks and they're creating these massive pot holes, and the local councils say it's not their problem! 
 I mean, something has to be done! 
 (Applause) 
 I think that's the sort of thing we need to hear. Thank you. 
 So, we'll put it down under 'road maintenance'. 
 And it's not just the country roads... 
 Yeah, I think you've had a fair go. 
 The suburban roads are in desperate need... 
 Sir, I think we need to hear... 
 ..of work also... 
 Can we cut the mic? Can we... 
 (Microphone silences) 
 No, not my mic, his mic! 
 It's a joke! 
 (Microphone silences) 
 No, not this mic! 
 Isn't it? 
 (Applause) 
 HIS mic! 
 The roads are appalling! Fix it! 
 Fix it! Get on with it! 
 (Applause) 
 Oh, and can you get the minutes from all three meetings and collate them into sort of report form? 
 Copy Jim? 
 And CC Rhonda. 
 And can you organise a quick little get-together so I can go over it with them? 
 And I printed some spreadsheets about half an hour ago. 
 There's nothing on the printer. 
 Can you check again? 
 We've gotta get this sorted out. 
 Sure. 
 OK, yep. 
 Sorry. Have you got a minute to say hello to Marvin? 
 Who's Marvin? 
 Marvin Hudfield. From Brooklyn? 
 Didn't Rhonda mention it? 
 No. 
 He's an expert in professional development. 
 Is this gonna involve us dividing into blue teams and red teams and using Hawaiian names? 
 Have you already done his course? 
 I'm not gonna get involved... 
 Marvin? Yep. Tony, can I introduce you to Marvin Hudfield? 
 Marvin, this is our CEO, Tony Woodford. 
 Ah, well, pleased to... Whoa! 
 It's gonna be a great week. (Laughs) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Hi. 
 Ah, come on in. 
 Welcome. Join us. 
 We could have done this in the office. 
 Oh, no, I've called this a seminar. 
 We might as well use the catering budget before the end of the year. 
 Great idea. 
 Woman : Sparkling or still? 
 Still, thank you. 
 Some bread? 
 Yes, please. 
 Sourdough or ciabatta? 
 Er, sourdough, and a nametag... 
 Oh, we know each other. 
 I don't know that we need a... 
 Mr Woodford. 
 Thank you, yep. 
 Sparkling or still? 
 No water or bread for me, thanks. 
 Hey, good job with this. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Yeah, sorry about the pages. 
 We're still having printer problems. 
 Why are the odd pages upside down? 
 Oh, the driver won't load. 
 It's complicated. 
 But there's some good stuff in here. 
 You know what, it was actually a worthwhile exercise. 
 Could have done without the third session, but we got some pretty decent feedback. 
 Yeah, absolutely. Well, we've been right through the report. 
 It's very exciting. 
 Thank you! 
 Yeah, tossed it around with the folks upstairs, and it's pretty clear what Tassie is crying out for. 
 Loud and clear. 
 Do tell. 
 A new stadium! 
 Just... 
 Where's that? 
 Over the page. 
 Next page. 
 There we go. 
 That's 14th. 
 Well, it's not in order of priority. 
 I did the report. 
 It's in order of priority. 
 But that's highlighted. 
 By you. 
 Can I just explain the buffet? 
 Can you just give us five minutes? 
 Er, but any allergies... 
 No, thank you. Yeah. 
 There's no point in us doing community consultation if we're not actually gonna listen to the community! 
 I thought we wanted to appear consultative. 
 No, we wanted to BE consultative. 
 Oh! 
 See, that wasn't clear. 
 I must have spoken to 1,000 people. 
 I barely remember anyone mentioning a stadium! 
 Did anyone express reservations about a stadium? 
 No. 
 So, there's interest? 
 No! 
 Can you drill down on it? 
 You're not gonna announce it? 
 No! 
 Or brief someone? 
 No! 
 Or do a drop? 
 No! 
 Or give a heads-up. You paused! 
 No! 
 All we want is for you to give us some plusses and minuses. 
 Mainly plusses. 
 But no announcements. 
 No! 
 You paused again. 
 Did I? 
 Yes! There was a gap... 
 Gazpacho shots? 
 Oooh, yes, please. Yum! 
 No, thank you. 
 Are you gonna have yours? 
 No. 
 I'll have two. 
 (On tannoy) The question is, what makes you strive for greatness? 
 You know what, Marvin? I don't think we need the microphone. 
 That's cool. I can go unplugged. 
 (Microphone silences) 
 Acoustic. Informal - but where was I? 
 Striving for greatness. 
 Right. 
 Is it, A, survival - you just want a job? 
 Or is it, B, competition - you wanna beat that guy? 
 Goals. You have targets to reach. 
 Or is it dreams? 
 You wanna change the world. 
 Can you run through the options one more time? 
 I think it's either 'B' or 'D'. 
 No, it's all of them, but it's a big, tough world out there, and when someone throws you a bag of snakes, what are you gonna do about it? 
 Katie? 
 Oh, I'm Nat. She's Katie. 
 Oh, I'm sorry about that. 
 I want you to open this envelope, pull out a piece of paper, and then read it to the rest of the group for me, please. 
 The tragedy in life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. 
 The tragedy... 
 Go on. 
 That's all there is. 
 I think it's the printer. 
 These arrived for you. 
 My spreadsheets! Where were they? 
 The travel agent downstairs. 
 Apparently they just appeared in the printer. 
 What? Oh, Hugh! Hugh, Hugh! 
 Yep. 
 Did you have a change to look through the list from Tassie? 
 Yeah, why are the odd pages upside down? 
 It's the printer. I wouldn't worry about that. What did you think? 
 Yeah, some interesting ideas. 
 Why does Hobart want a second casino? 
 Have you been to the first? Trust me. 
 What did you think of the stadium idea? 
 What stadium? 
 Number 14. 
 Oh, so, there are more pages. 
 After Salamanca monorail. 
 Yep, got it. Hobart stadium. 
 Yeah, I'm just thinking ahead, just if it came up. 
 What would you say to someone who was thinking of building a stadium? 
 Don't? 
 Right, but what if they really, really wanted to build a stadium? 
 Do it, but not in Tasmania. 
 What if it's a multipurpose stadium? 
 What are the other purposes? 
 Erm... yeah, we're gonna have to look into that. 
 A successful workplace will maintain a culture of sustainable innovation, spiritual rejuvenation, and imaginative visualisation, and every successful worker will be strategically and tactically invested in everything that they do. 
 Close your eyes. 
 Alright, you are on an elevator. 
 It's a fast one. 
 We're already at the 10th floor, now 20, 30. 
 Oh, wow, we're at the top floor. 
 You see big blue sky, big fluffy white clouds just waiting for all you eagles to jump in there and soar. 
 Alright, let's all link hands and close the circle. 
 That's it. I'm really sorry, Marvin. 
 I've got a meeting! 
 It can wait. 
 The Minister for Regional Affairs might not. 
 Come on, Katie. 
 It's Nat. 
 I want you here, Nat, alright? 
 Feel that energy being transmitted? 
 See how there's more power in numbers? 
 Katie, can you give... Katie?! 
 Over here! 
 Why are you over there?! 
 We're hot-desking. 
 Why? 
 Marvin said it breaks down rigidities. 
 Man : Aces in their places. 
 What? 
 He wants us to all bat 1,000. 
 What does that mean? 
 I don't know, but he made us write it down. 
 Where's Hugh? 
 Here. 
 Well done, Nat. 
 Not moving! 
 Hugh : This is preliminary. 
 Yep. 
 But they say the real key to stadiums is how many events they're used for in total over a year. 
 All up? 
 Yep. 
 They say you need a minimum of 90, 95 events. 
 And how many are currently planned for this year? 
 Three. 
 Three? 
 Yep. 
 Oh, hang on - is there a test match this year? 
 Yes, there is! 
 OK, then, three. 
 And the sweet spot for stadiums is a capacity of around 60,000. 
 Oh, 60,000! This is not gonna be easy to solve. 
 Right. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm in a lift. 
 I'm trying to see the blue sky. 
 Just checking you got the message about the 25th. 
 Great! And what do you reckon? 
 No, I know. 
 We would have normally done a mail-out, but the printer's on the blink. 
 Yep. No. No, that's fine. 
 I'll call him. 
 Uh, can I call you back? 
 I've been watching you. 
 Yes, I've noticed. 
 Let's talk interpersonal skills. 
 Who was that? 
 Uh, it was just one of our project delivery supervisors. 
 And how do you think he's feeling right now? 
 Well, I just hung up on him. 
 It's hard to tell. 
 You know when you're on the phone to a customer, you... 
 Colleague. 
 Either way, you gotta make him feel like he's the most important person in the world. 
 It's you, me, one-on-one connection! 
 You understand? 
 Sort of. 
 You know what you want from him? 
 You want buying. 
 I actually just wanted an email address. 
 I guess what we're trying to do is... 
 Can you open your eyes, please? 
 Sorry. 
 What we're trying to do is work out potential. 
 I mean, would there ever be enough call for a stadium? 
 Well, what's that saying about stadiums? 
 If you build it, they will come. 
 Who? 
 The baseballs. 
 I don't think they play baseball in Tassie. 
 No, he's not talking about baseball in Tassie. 
 Different subject. 
 No, no, still Tassie. 
 But not Tassie. 
 I'm talking about both. 
 He's talking about a baseball movie where they came out of the cornfields. 
 Something 'Dreams'. 
 Hoop Dreams. 
 No, no. 
 Dream Girls. 
 No, it was the one with the guy who played Darth Vader. 
 You know he was Luke Skywalker's father? 
 (Upbeat music plays) 
 Ah! What are you doing in here? 
 Trying to avoid a trust exercise. 
 Oh, is that why they're all in blindfolds? 
 We've got a consultant in. 
 Rhonda organised it. 
 Oh. Why didn't you just do a conference in Bali? 
 It was a budget thing. 
 That's what she's planning to do. 
 What?! 
 I wanted an update on the stadium. 
 Where are we at? 
 We're still looking into it. 
 What's the next step? 
 Well, if we can make the broad outline work, we'll, you know, develop a draft master plan and then invite potential stakeholders... 
 And then? 
 Well, then do a full business case study. 
 And then? 
 Just don't want to rule out other options. 
 But they asked for a stadium. 
 They asked for lots of things. 
 Economic assistance mostly - research grants, subsidies. 
 A new uni. 
 What? 
 It would have to be big - something you could see from a distance. 
 They don't need a new uni! 
 Or a hadron collider. 
 You don't know what that is. 
 Well, it sounds big. 
 It's underground. 
 Build one above ground. 
 Or a synchrotron! 
 OK, Jim, seriously, I am warning you. 
 What? 
 If this kind of haphazard, scatter-gun approach keeps going, I go! 
 Alright! I get a little excited. 
 It's OK. 
 Stick with the stadium. Let us know when you're ready to talk turkey. 
 Oh, wow! This is great! 
 I'm sensing energy. 
 It's all around me. I can sense it. 
 This is great! It's filled with vibrancy and drive and purpose! 
 What happened to you? 
 Trust exercise. 
 Marvin said I was driving behind the headlights. 
 I tell you, I am so over this. 
 Seriously, a week? 
 That's what he was booked for. 
 You wanted these? 
 Oh! Printer's back working? 
 No, I went to Rapid Copy again. 
 We're silver members now. 
 Good afternoon, Nation Building Authority. How may I help you? 
 Where am I supposed to go? 
 Oh! They don't have an AFL team based there, though, do they? 
 No. 
 Do you think they might get one? 
 No. 
 But teams do play there. 
 Mostly in Launceston. 
 An A-league team? 
 Not likely. 
 NRL? 
 Never. 
 Super 16? 
 I've got some PVC piping. 
 Yeah, just whack it there, mate. 
 Can I get a name? 
 Tony. 
 Right, Tony the receptionist. 
 No... 
 Actually, let's go back to local sport. Give me some crowd figures. 
 Well, the last TSL game - a bit of a local derby - 
 Clarence beat Lauderdale at final, and they had 1,600 spectators. 
 And players and officials. 
 Yeah, I think we can skip local football. What about test cricket? 
 Oh, yeah, OK. 
 Test match a few years ago. 16,000. 
 Oooh! It's not 60, but it's not bad. 
 Over five days. 
 Yeah, your pauses are too long. 
 Ricky Ponting's final match. 
 You did it again. 
 Schoolkids got in for free. 
 Yep, I... 
 What about the Targa? 
 It's a car rally. 
 Mmm. 
 Through the bush. 
 Well, they could finish at the oval. 
 Yeah, I don't think so. 
 Maybe we go back to those baseballers. 
 What? 
 You said they'd come. 
 (Ringing tone) 
 Tony : Katie, it's me. 
 Yes, I know where you are. 
 I can see you! 
 Don't wave. You'll hit someone. 
 OK, can you ask Scott and Hugh to come up here ASAP? 
 I don't care about their cooldown. 
 Just get them up here. 
 Actually, send everyone up here. 
 Yes, the whole tribe. 
 Do the chant later. 
 I think that's a bit big for Hobart. 
 Looks good. 
 Yeah, looks great. 
 Not sure we need a roof. 
 I've just had a thought. 
 We're forgetting that it's a multipurpose stadium. 
 Oh, of course. 
 So, we've just gotta think of all the other uses Tasmanians might have for the stadium apart from sport. 
 Yeah, yeah, maybe... 
 I think we should just start... 
 Oh, sorry, Marvin, we're just going through something... 
 Oh, go right ahead. I'm not here. 
 But you are. 
 No, he's not. 
 Just a shadow, here to observe. 
 Yep, OK, well, you've got music festivals. 
 Yep. 
 Finishes to fun runs. 
 Yeah. 
 Australia Day functions. 
 Yeah, they're all kind of small-fry, though, aren't they? 
 Mega operas. Stadium concerts. 
 Who's gonna do a stadium concert in Hobart? 
 Andre Rieu. 
 He could get his carriage in. 
 OK, so, we bag Andre Rieu. One night. 
 Big crowd. Show finishes, standing ovation. Then what? 
 He does an encore. Bit of Strauss. 
 No, I mean the following year. 
 Cirque du Soleil? 
 Oh, they bring their own tents. 
 Tony, I've just solved something. 
 Is it about Tasmania? 
 You know what I'm seeing here? 
 What, Marvin? 
 Three minds, one spark, but where's the flame? 
 Bushfire shelter? 
 Write that down. 
 I want you all to take your shoes off. 
 I'm not gonna get undressed. 
 Where'd Marvin go? 
 I don't know. 
 I hope he's not offended. 
 Quite frankly, I don't care. 
 I'm hoping for him to sign my book. 
 Oh, you're kidding me. 
 It's part of a package - and his CD, Music To Solve By! 
 (Sighs) Amy. 
 Did you not get a copy? 
 No. Can I have my desk back, please? 
 So, where are we at with the new stadium? 
 Rhonda, I'm gonna give this to you straight. 
 A reality sandwich. 
 The Tasmanians do not need nor want a huge new stadium. 
 I can't believe the ingratitude of some people. 
 They didn't ask for one. 
 They don't know what they want. 
 They live there! 
 That's not the point. 
 We need to start planning for one. 
 Why? 
 Failure to plan is a plan for failure. 
 Give me the book. 
 No! 
 Rhonda, it doesn't make sense. 
 So, there are a few problems... 
 Lack of populations, too few events, distance, fixed costs, where to put it... 
 But those negatives are far outweighed by the positives. 
 Go on. 
 I don't have any. 
 Oh, hang on. 
 Coffee, Tony? 
 Thanks, Katie. 
 And a muffin? 
 Sure. 
 (Clarinet plays) 
 You know what, Marvin? 
 I am so snowed under. 
 You need to chill out a little bit, Tony. 
 I'm not going to take off my shoes. 
 You know I had a guy like you, a CEO, a few years back. 
 Real smart guy, knew all the tricks, wasn't getting anywhere. 
 So, I asked him one day, 'Hey, man, do you want to fish or cut bait?' 
 You know what he said? 
 No. 
 He said, 'Let's go fishing.' 
 I said, 'Alright, it's time to start feeding that gorilla.' 
 With fish? 
 Had another guy - VP of a big blue chip company. 
 You ever hear of Milwaukee Data Systems? 
 Would you excuse me for a second? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Sure. 
 (Plays clarinet) 
 Amy? Where's Amy? 
 Amy. Amy! 
 Over here. 
 I want that guy out. 
 But we've got a break... 
 Out! 
 But we haven't graduated! 
 Out! 
 If he leaves now, none of us will receive the knowledge! 
 Alright, but I want him out by tomorrow, is that clear? 
 Yes. 
 Just the bloke I've been looking for. 
 Everything OK? 
 It will be. 
 Keep this under your hat. 
 Massive breakthrough on the stadium. 
 Really? 
 The signs are good we may well get the OK to call it the Princess Mary Donaldson Arena. 
 I just need to get something from my drawer. 
 No, Jim, no! 
 Whoa, whoa, Tony, Tony. 
 No, no, no, Jim! 
 Jim, I told you! I told you! 
 What's this? 
 What do you mean 'what is it'? 
 It's my letter of resignation! 
 Why is half a page missing? 
 Oh, the printer is not... the driver... 
 Look, I'll get Katie to do the other half! 
 The point is I'm not gonna let the NBA become the vehicle for every crazy white elephant scheme that people dream up! 
 This is the final straw! 
 Tasmania needs sensible investment. 
 They need a stadium. 
 No, they don't! 
 I'll tell you what they need! 
 They need better roads, better rail, they need freight links to the mainland, industry development, airport runway extension... 
 Whoa, these are ringing a bell. 
 Where have I heard these before? 
 In my report! Numbers one to five! 
 Oh, I must have skimmed over those. 
 Tasmania turned to us for practical economic assistance and we failed them! 
 Alright, let me take it upstairs. 
 I'll see what I can sort out. 
 In the meantime, I don't want this. 
 Jim. 
 Look at what you've got here. 
 You've got a great team doing great work, important work. 
 Think it over. 
 Things will look different in the morning. 
 Alright. 
 Hey, let's go and have coffee. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, we should spend more time together. 
 (Plays clarinet) 
 OK, you can keep the letter in your drawer. 
 This is a win for you. 
 They cancelled the stadium idea? 
 Cabinet met. They've knocked us back on using Princess Mary. 
 Apparently Frederik put his foot down. 
 Yeah, go on, say it. 
 I told you so! 
 I'm not saying anything! 
 Tony, Marvin's leaving. 
 Good. 
 He just popped in to say goodbye. 
 Alright. I'll be right back! 
 Let's make this quick. 
 See you later, Marvin. Oooh! 
 You're gonna get there, buddy. 
 OK, yeah. 
 Well, Marvin's off, so, let's give him a warm round of... 
 Thank you! 
 ..applause. 
 Katie, Amy, Nat, Scott, use that knowledge! 
 (Laughs) OK, thanks, Marvin. 
 Lock that door. 
 Sorry about that. Now, where were we? 
 Tassie. 
 That's New Zealand. 
 Let's get back to that list of yours. 
 I think we've identified something that we can really make work. 
 Roads? Airport extension? 
 Er, next page. 
 Er, next page. 
 Detention centre? 
 Er, next page. I think it's 18. 
 Film studios? 
 The Errol Flynn Academy of Cinematic Excellence. 
 What we hope to hear from you tonight is your number one priority. 
 So, no number twos. 
 No, they can do number two... 
 Number ones first. 
 So, if you want to do number twos, wait till everyone has done their number ones. 
 Yep, OK. 
 Trying to hear from as many people as possible. 
 Let's restrict our comments and questions to maybe a minute. 
 Mine's in two parts. 
 OK, 30 seconds each. 
 We're a little pushed for time, and it's been wonderful to hear from everyone. 
 Has anyone got a really, really quick comment or question? 
 Right over here! Yeah? 
 Again, quick comment. 
 When will tea and coffee be served? 
 Oh, definitely a quick question. 
 Not sure that that's your number one priority. 
 I'm the caterer. 
 My apologies.
