 Dean Martin : ♪ We can sing in the glow of a star that I know... ♪ 
 Man : For the Prime Minister's award for excellence in public sector management, the nominations are - the CSIRO, Avian Flu Eradication Scheme, Nation Building Australia, Smart Cities, the Australian Tax Office, Community Programs Project. 
 And the winner - the CSIRO, Avian Flu Eradication Scheme. 
 (Applause) 
 Good morning, Tony. 
 Tony : Good morning, Amy. 
 Bad luck about last night. 
 Man : Yeah, bad luck, Tony. 
 Ah, well, nice to be nominated. 
 Man : Robbed! 
 I don't even know who votes for those awards. 
 I think it's a panel of experts in a variety of fields. 
 Bullshit. 
 It's just an awards night. 
 Yeah. 
 The CSIRO?! 
 They win one Nobel Prize and it's all, 'Oh, all heil the CSIRO.' 
 Nup. 
 What do you think? 
 Looks good. 
 Now you can get some work done without being distracted. 
 Perfect! 
 Yeah, OK. 
 Open or shut? 
 Shut. 
 Keep going! 
 Wait till you hear a noise. 
 Heard it! 
 OK. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Intercom) 
 Katie. 
 Have you got a moment for Jim? 
 Sure. 
 When? 
 Does he have his hand on my door handle? 
 Yes. 
 Now? 
 OK, Jim. 
 I like this. Ah, yeah. 
 It's good, isn't it? 
 Yeah. How'd you pull up? 
 Oh, fine. 
 I'll say it again. We were robbed. 
 Yeah, I don't think so. 
 CSIRO?! 
 What have those clowns ever done? 
 They sequenced the bird flu gene. 
 Pfft, cheap seats! 
 You try rolling out a integrated urban renewal program. 
 But that's it, Jim! 
 We didn't roll it out. What?! 
 We just rolled out a plan. 
 We did one test site that's been in limbo ever since. 
 Still, nice to be nominated. 
 Just listening to what those other organisations have done last night, I just couldn't help but think... 
 We've had this conversation! 
 Are we really achieving anything? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 They love you in Canberra. 
 Every time we run into trouble, you're there. 
 That's part of the problem. 
 And what about everything you're doing here? 
 This office. You've just had the door frosted. 
 But in terms of completed projects. 
 What about that? 
 We didn't build that. 
 Really? 
 It's decoration. 
 Really? 
 It says '1915'. 
 Ah, did they finish it? 
 What do you reckon? What about all these other great plans? 
 That's it, Jim. Plans! 
 Hey! Bird in the hand. 
 That's not a bird in the hand. 
 That's the drawing of a... it's a plan to draw a bird! 
 With my luck, it'll be endangered. 
 You're still upset about the award. 
 I'm not upset... What did you want? 
 I don't normally do this... but I need a favour. 
 No, I'm not speaking. 
 Woman : I know and it's a road. 
 I mean, it really should be... 
 OK, I am worried that we are going to have to push the start date back. 
 Yes, again. 
 Katie! Can I get a glass of water, please, sweetheart? 
 It sounds like you're telling me there's a range of issues affecting the completion date. 
 Hugh, will you be a darling and get me a cup of tea, please? 
 Actually, would you mind if I called you right back? 
 Thank you very much. 
 Straightaway. OK, bye. 
 (Sighs) Oh, lifesaver. 
 (Whispers) I just need a minute. 
 Just cut to the chase. 
 The Ord River Scheme. 
 Yep, I'm out. 
 No, no, hear me out. 
 Alright, but I've got one hand on the door. 
 It's gone a bit pear-shaped. 
 Oh, it's been pear-shaped since the day... 
 No, no, sit down! I'll admit, it hasn't been a total success. 
 Billions of dollars sunk into a agricultural scheme that hasn't managed to come up with one economically sustainable crop. 
 Well, that's one version. 
 What's the other version? 
 It's been on a stamp. 
 Jim, it's a joke! 
 Anyway, here's the situation. 
 We've kind of agreed to expanding the thing. 
 OK, I am out. We're just rolling out another phase. 
 Why would anyone agree to something so stupid? 
 It was an election. 
 It got away from us. 
 The Prime Minister signed a memorandum of understanding. 
 Why? 
 I don't think he understood it. 
 Jim! 
 What could we do? 
 Learn from history! Speak to people. 
 Did you do any research? 
 Absolutely! 
 And? 
 Every focus group came back, thumbs up! 
 (Sighs) Jim! Every time they heard northern food bowl - 98%. 
 Paid parental only got 70. 
 How much are they planning to spend on it? 3... 350 million. 
 More if they can make it work. 
 Has any cost-benefit analysis been done? 
 Oh, it's too late for that now? 
 Jim! 
 Next time! 
 Come on, you're great at this stuff. 
 Disaster management? 
 Mega projects, big-picture thinking. 
 No, I'm not going to get dragged into someone else's ridiculous scheme. 
 (Sighs) Alright, if you wanna say no, just say no. No. 
 But before you do...I just did. 
 Let me make you a deal. 
 Have a look at it, and if it's your call that we shelve the project, then that's what we do. 
 Really? 
 We front up to the Australian public, admit we got it wrong and then you can, maybe, get back to having a crack at this thing. 
 Ah. 
 Ooh, lovely. 
 Hey, and a biscuit? 
 Thank you. 
 (Sighs) 
 That was so unfair last night. 
 I'm still livid. Livid! 
 It's just an awards night. 
 Oh, come on! The CSIRO? 
 I mean, if they'd cured bird flu, maybe, but a research program? Pfft. 
 Do you know why we didn't win last night? 
 Because the Smart Cities program was... 
 Because we didn't have a professional DVD. 
 What? Every other organisation had a first-rate audiovisual presentation. 
 I wasn't really paying attention. 
 What, you didn't see the ATO and the 3-D thing they had there? 
 What did we have? 
 Ooh, a couple of slides and a logo. 
 I really don't think that was the issue. 
 Well, I beg to differ, and that is WHY... 
 Please, don't finish that sentence. 
 ..I'm fast-tracking a DVD. 
 We don't need a DVD. 
 This organisation needs professional audiovisual materials. 
 This organisation needs to finish a project. 
 In the meantime, let's celebrate our achievements. 
 Shouldn't we wait until we have some? 
 And let the Australian Tax Office walk all over us again? 
 Ooh, not on my watch! 
 No, no, not gonna happen. 
 I just can't believe this is what we... 
 (Gasping) 
 No, bring them in. 
 Oh, good. 
 We just don't need to have a banquet every time we get a meeting. 
 OK, thank you. 
 I thought this was sorted three months ago. 
 We're about to have a completed piece of road in Perth. 
 Like, a pretty simple build! 
 And now you're telling me... 
 It's stalled. 
 Oh, you said stopped. 
 And has anyone been able to give you a clear explanation as to why? 
 There's an issue between Main Roads WA and the contractor. 
 Oh, you're kidding me. 
 And there's an issue between State and Federal. 
 And there's an issue between the PPP and the Infrastructure Authority. 
 That's enough, Hugh. 
 There's one with Financing too. 
 Is there any chance we can get all these groups together? 
 Well, they've set up a new group... 
 Well, a taskforce. 
 ..to try and get all the groups on the one page, but now they've got an issue as well, so they've turned to us. 
 This is exactly what I was talking to Jim about! 
 We've got to get a project completed! 
 We've gotta get some runs on the board or seriously, I fear for our future. 
 Do you want me to head to Perth? 
 No! Get them here! 
 Get the key people in this room. 
 Find out why nothing's being done! 
 I wanna hear the sound of bulldozers. Got it. 
 Is this a bad time to raise the party? What party? 
 We're coming up to our first anniversary. 
 (Sighs) Don't remind me. 
 We need to decide how we'd like to mark the occasion. 
 A minute's silence. 
 What was that? 
 Just keep going. 
 Katie and I were thinking maybe we should have a party here. 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Alright, OK. But Amy, Katie - 
 I don't want the preparation for this party to distract the office. 
 Sure. Can I just ask one question? 
 Yes. About the catering? Yes. 
 Is everyone happy with Mexican? 
 All : Yeah! 
 Katie : Yes, they love it! 
 Sorry, guys, not finished. 
 Here she is. Come on in. 
 Rhonda, I am smack bang in the middle of something. 
 Doesn't matter. Karsten's on fire. 
 We've had some great ideas already. 
 They're just thought-starters, OK? 
 There's still a lot of room here for your imput. 
 I could just email you. 
 No, no, don't be silly. 
 As someone who is at the coalface, I want you to tell us what the NBA is all about. 
 First thoughts, no wrong answers. 
 Um, we're about... identifying, planning and implementing long-term infrastructure needs... 
 (Snores) 
 ..with a view to facilitating their delivery. 
 And we just lost the 18 to 35s. 
 What? 
 I'm gonna pop down dreams. 
 Ooh, and we're back. 
 I never said dreams. 
 I think you meant to. 
 No, I didn't. 
 OK, and I think you're also saying that the NBA is about vision. 
 I can see that. 
 That is crystal clear! 
 You know what? 
 I've actually got work to do. 
 That is good. What are you working on at the moment? 
 A section of road in Perth. 
 No, a dream. 
 OK. 
 And what's driving it? 
 A deadline. 
 Passion. 
 What? That's what I'm seeing here - passion. 
 It's not passion. 
 I'm just pissed off. 
 No, no, no, no, don't be pissed off. 
 Just funnel your energy through Karsten. 
 (Whispers) Come on, get involved. 
 Power of passionate people! 
 Aw, now we're away! 
 Getting things done. 
 No, see that's my problem - we're not getting things done. 
 I don't see that as a problem, OK? 
 What see is that you are striving to create pathways to forge better communication. 
 I see you overcoming obstacles in order to achieve a dream. 
 We're just trying to finish a road. 
 You're very much mistaken. 
 OK, I'm gonna knock together a few storyboards. 
 Ooh, love it! 
 'Cause I see a pretty important little film happening here. 
 I'm just gonna... 
 Film... that would be exciting. 
 I would love a film. 
 Voice-over : The top end of Australia is harsh country, but no match for a bit of Aussie ingenuity and manpower. 
 The mighty Argyle dam holds 18 times more water than Sydney harbour. 
 Precious water that will soon turn this desert into a veritable food bowl. 
 I'm pretty sure we studied this at high school. 
 We did Lasseter's Reef. 
 Lasseter's Reef was a myth. 
 Well, so they say. 
 Yep, but they actually built the Ord River scheme. 
 I know. I saw it. 
 It's very impressive. 
 Yeah, if you're a member of the local yacht club, but in terms of it becoming a food bowl, let's just say it hasn't quite gone to plan. 
 Even with Aussie ingenuity? 
 Yeah, it's 40 years old. 
 Anyway, let's get up to date with what's happening now, who's running it, what are they planning and what's going wrong? 
 OK, got it. 
 OK. 
 Is it OK if I watch the rest of the video? Why? 
 I just wanna see how it works out. 
 I told you how. It doesn't. 
 Spoiler alert! 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Cheers. 
 All the way. 
 Until you hear a sound! 
 Heard it. 
 OK, now this will probably just be overlay. 
 You know, some staff testimonials showing the workers and the work. 
 Very much the people and projects. 
 You know, sort of visual building blocks. 
 We did something similar with the mining cuts. 
 Oh, I loved that one! 
 Namaste, namaste, thank you. 
 OK, now everybody ready? 
 And Amy, I want you just to turn to camera, pick up the phone and say, 'Hello, Nation Building Authority.' 
 But it's not ringing. 
 Well, just pretend. 
 Right. 
 OK, and action. 
 Hello, Nation Building Authority. 
 No, pick up the phone first. 
 The turn. Turn, phone, speak. 
 Sorry, you did say... 
 No, it's alright. Don't think. 
 About what? About anything. 
 OK - and still rolling - and action! 
 I'm thinking. Are you thinking about the phone ringing? 
 No. 
 Hmm. 
 Ah, so the dam was finished in 1972. 
 Thanks to Aussie ingenuity. 
 Yeah, I've seen the video. 
 The water was used to grow cotton, rice and sugar. 
 All of which were failures. 
 Do we know why? 
 According to the CSIRO, the extreme climate, poor soil and massive distances. 
 Basically, the whole northern food bowl was... 
 ..they had a technical name for it. 
 A pipe dream? Unviable due to excessive input costs. 
 And a caterpillar who ate the cotton. 
 So stage one was a joke. 
 Unviable. 
 What did they do then? 
 Rolled out stage two. 
 Yeah, this time with mangoes, sorghum, chia - 
 I'm not sure what that is - and, um... 
 Sandalwood. 
 So what went wrong this time? 
 Again, input costs. 
 And that caterpillar came back. 
 They also tried rice again, but it was hit by a fungus. 
 They lost an entire crop to a fungus? 
 No, only half a crop. 
 The other half was eaten by magpie geese. 
 Somehow they found out about the rice. 
 CSIRO didn't have an answer for that, did they? 
 Scotty, let it go. 
 No. 
 Katie : OK, and with the chicken enchiladas, do we need to order a separate salsa dip? 
 And is that per person? 
 Sorry, per gringo? 
 Alright, and if you could just email through a quote. 
 OK, thanks. 
 How'd you go with Perth? 
 For the freeway. 
 Organising for the key players to come across. 
 Oh, yes! 
 Sorry, I've got it on my list. 
 Can I just ring the taco cart man first? 
 Katie! 
 I'll ring them right now. 
 Oh, and Nat! 
 Yes. 
 Do you know anything about pinatas? 
 It's ringing. 
 Alright, so stage two was an unmitigated disaster. 
 Oh, no, they didn't use that term but... 
 It underperformed. 
 But they got on top of that caterpillar. 
 I think the magpie geese ate it. 
 Keep going. 
 Ah, yeah, sorry. So for stage three they've gone back to sugar. 
 Right. OK, well, that's great guys, thanks. 
 Fingers crossed. 
 Karsten : Alright, everybody looking at me. 
 OK, looking at me. 
 I want everyone to all be working. 
 Bit of movement, thought. 
 Look like you're planning things. 
 You're the engine room of the NBA, OK? 
 And working, acting. 
 And tracking left, tracking left, tracking left. 
 And cut. 
 Katie : Sorry, these are for me. 
 Katie. 
 Oh, if a guy drops off some taco shells, can you buzz me? 
 OK, just bring it back. 
 First positions! 
 Given these largely insurmountable obstacles and lack of any clear solutions to the... 
 Amy : Hugh, is Tony in there? 
 Hugh : Ah, I don't know, sorry. 
 Scott, is Tony in there? 
 I'm not sure. We'll have a listen. 
 I'm in here! 
 I can hear him. 
 Sorry, can I have a moment? 
 Yeah, could you just give us five minutes? 
 Sure. 
 Alone. 
 Yep. 
 I can still see you! 
 Oh. 
 Still! 
 Thank you. 
 Can you read that back to me? 
 Ah, given these largely... 
 No, before that. 
 Go back a paragraph. 
 The scheme is fundamentally flawed. 
 To be truly viable, we would have to secure four times the amount of irrigated farmland, as well as implement an unprecedented upgrade of road, rail and water infrastructure. 
 Given these... 
 Given these largely insurmountable obstacles and lack of any clear solutions, we have no choice but to recommend that any further expansion of the scheme be suspended indefinitely. 
 In short, our priorities lie elsewhere. 
 Yours sincerely, blah blah blah. 
 OK. 
 Send it to Jim first thing tomorrow? 
 That'd be great. 
 OK. 
 Can I get you a coffee? 
 Sure. 
 OK. 
 Oh, and Katie. 
 Can you think of a... 
 I mean, not that you have to, but just off the top of your head, can you think of a project that we're doing here that's, sort of, achieving something for the future? 
 How do you mean? 
 Well, a project that you've been impressed with. 
 The northern food bowl. 
 Sounds great! 
 Yeah, but we're not proceeding with it. 
 Yeah, when you do, amazing! 
 Yeah, but a different project. 
 I'll have a think. 
 (Strains) OK. 
 (Laughs) Yeah. 
 Do you want me to get Amy back? 
 Yep. 
 Sure. OK. 
 Amy! 
 Here! 
 Whoa! 
 Karsten : Alrighty. Now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions, Hugh. 
 Do I look at you? Ah, no, no. 
 Straight down the camera. OK. 
 And then back to you? 
 No, don't look at me at all. 
 I just don't want to be rude. 
 Understood. OK, rolling up. 
 I can look at him? 
 He's the cameraman. 
 Sorry, what's going on? 
 Um, staff testimonials. 
 Just getting some grabs of what the job means to you, what we're achieving. 
 Actually, we'll need to pop you in at some point so don't... 
 Um, I actually need Hugh now. 
 We've got a team from Perth flying in for a meeting and we need to prep. 
 Ooh, should we film that meeting? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, probably not. 
 Ooh, what about the prep? 
 No, just... 
 Good idea. No, that's fine. 
 Just whenever he's done. 
 Katie : Tony, I thought of something that we do here that'll make a difference in the future. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 We recycle! 
 You're pausing... 
 Do you want me to keep thinking? 
 I'll keep thinking. 
 Shut! 
 Oh, yep. 
 Did it! 
 Don't look at you or the cameraman. 
 Ah, no. 
 What about Rhonda? 
 Ah, no, no, no. 
 Straight into the camera. 
 Barrel it? 
 Barrel it! 
 That's exactly right. 
 OK, now let's start again. 
 What is the NBA? 
 Do you say action? 
 Ah, yes. 
 And action. 
 We're a conduit. 
 A means to funnel great ideas from concept stage to reality. 
 Excellent, and what do you see as your role? 
 I'm a tool. 
 Do you say cut? 
 Ah, yeah. And cut. 
 Is that a wrap? 
 No, not yet. No. 
 It's Louise, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, great. Very nice to finally put a face to a name. 
 Oh, you too. 
 I know you're just in Sydney... 
 Anywhere? 
 Yes, anywhere you like. 
 So thanks so much for making the effort to come across. 
 Man : We understand how important this is. 
 I just feel there's been layers upon layers of bureaucrats and supervisors. 
 We know what you mean. 
 I thought we'd go straight to the people at the coalface. 
 Great idea, and we're so often operating in different silos, so it's a good chance to get us key players together. 
 Right, and that's what we're here to do - find out what's happening with the road, why the delay, how can we help facilitate and lock in a clear timeline. 
 Excellent idea. 
 Now before we go any further, can I just clarify everyone's roles? 
 Er, David? 
 I head up our media unit. 
 Government communications. 
 Sorry, David, probably didn't need you to fly over... 
 No, no, no, it's important. We need to get the message out on the... 
 ..the road.Road! 
 That it's moving ahead. 
 Right. Um, Louise? Your role is... 
 PR. I work closely with David. 
 OK, well, yep. 
 Ah, Matt? 
 I'm on the other end of things. 
 Good. 
 Marketing and promotions. 
 Jeremy? 
 I work with Matt. 
 Is anyone here not from media or PR? 
 Woman : Community liaison. 
 Anyone involved in actual engineering or construction? 
 Louise : Well, I'd like to think we're all involved in... 
 Does anyone own a hard hat? 
 Well, I've got access to one. 
 Site visits, photo opportunities. 
 It's good. 
 I can borrow Matt's. 
 Yeah. 
 Great! 
 Katie : You wanted the team from Perth? 
 The Construction team. 
 They're all PR and marketing. 
 I should have picked it from their iPhone covers. Isn't that good? 
 We're not trying to sell a road but build one. 
 They said they were running it. 
 Sign of the times. 
 Karsten : Can I just get you to clear the set? 
 I want the construction team. 
 Got it. 
 OK. Now Amy, I want you to walk up to Katie and just hand her the file. 
 Like that? 
 Yes, actually that is not a file. 
 It's a menu. You said to use something we're working on. 
 It's for our anniversary party. 
 We're having Tex Mex. 
 I'm not sure if he's in, Jim. 
 Oh, that's OK. I'll give him a call. 
 (Ringing) 
 (Whispers) Oh, sh1t. 
 Hey, Jim. 
 Why are you whispering? 
 Just because I didn't want to... 
 It's alright, Katie, I'm actually in! 
 Sorry about that, big mix-up. 
 There you are! 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Well... 
 Is everything OK? 
 Spoke to Canberra. 
 How'd they take it? 
 It's a big step. 
 It's the right step. 
 Admit this was a mistake, eat a sh1t sandwich and save the nation billions. 
 They actually preferred your other option. 
 There was no other option. 
 'To be viable, the Ord river scheme would need four times the amount of irrigated land.' 
 Jim... 
 'An unprecedented upgrade, economies of scale, subsidies, grants, tax breaks.' 
 I didn't write that. 
 Yes, you did. It's right there. 
 Yeah, but I didn't suggest it. 
 I was building a case for the negative! 
 Four times, unprecedented upgrade, economies of scale - 
 I went through two highlighter pens. 
 But they're suggestions against the proposition. 
 Against? 
 Yes! 
 Did you ever do debating? 
 Jim! 
 The PM has said yes. 
 (Sighs) No. 
 He's willing the quadruple the whole enchilada. 
 Everyone was in a panic over this thing, but when Cabinet saw your proposal... 
 It's gone to Cabinet?! 
 Fastest passage since I've been there. They practically applauded. 
 Now give me your speech about not achieving anything. 
 Keep this up, we could have a crack at that thing. 
 (Sighs) 
 Voice-over : When 'no' is just the first syllable in knowledge. 
 When dreams break free of their foundations. 
 Welcome home! 
 Yeah, I'm a little worried. 
 I'm a little confused. 
 I think Karsten might have gone too high-concept with this. 
 What happened to all the interviews? 
 Oh, they didn't work. Everyone was too vague about what they do here. 
 And that's supposed to clarify things? 
 We need to start again. 
 Or stop. 
 Can't stop now. 
 I've spoken to the media unit. 
 They've got an idea apparently, so... 
 Get Katie to pop that out and get it back to me? Thanks, darling. 
 Katie : Tony? Are you OK, Tony? 
 Go away! 
 Not now? 
 I don't think so. 
 Jim : That's great news. 
 Absolutely. 
 Keep me in the loop. Cheers. 
 Minister for Regional Development. 
 They've given us major project status. 
 Oh, God. 
 They've set up a cross-agency taskforce. 
 We're making a massive mistake. 
 What do you mean? Thanks to you, we've dodged a bullet. 
 This scheme has no chance of working. 
 Every report says so. 
 (Sighs) Don't let science stand in the way of a good idea. 
 Even the CSIRO are down on us. 
 Yeah, well, they won't win the PM's award next year, will they? 
 Can we just forget about awards? 
 OK, but focus on the positives. 
 There are billions of starving people right now. 
 How's that a positive? 
 We're building a food bowl! 
 It's like that song. 
 You know, feed the world. 
 Let them know it's party time. 
 Christmas time. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 Nat? 
 Yep. 
 Did you want to speak with Lindsay? 
 Who's Lindsay? 
 The building manager. 
 Tell him I'm in a meeting. 
 Ah, she's in a meeting. 
 Sorry, Lindsay! 
 I was thinking of another... 
 What's up? 
 I just got your email about the smoke detectors. 
 What about them? 
 You want them disabled on the 15th. 
 Who's requested that? 
 Um, not sure. Something about an anniversary party, open flames. 
 Yeah, can I just check on that and get back to you? 
 Yeah, no worries. 
 Great, thanks, Lindsay. 
 It's so they don't accidentally go off. 
 Why would our smoke detectors go off? 
 From the flames from the chili cart. 
 The what?! To cook the Mexican food for the party. 
 It's going to cost thousands of dollars. 
 No, the food's really cheap. 
 It's the margaritas... 
 Not the food, the fire alarms, OK? 
 And according to this, we're gonna have to pay to have two members of the fire brigade to be here all night. 
 Do you think they'd mind wearing sombreros? 
 You know what? I don't care. 
 I just want to get back to this road. 
 What did the Perth team say? 
 (Whispers) Oh. 
 You said you were gonna call them... 
 We had an issue with the party. 
 Katie... 
 She had to change mariachi bands. 
 Jim : Look, I'm not saying there aren't a few negatives. 
 Negatives?! Massive costs, logistical nightmares, environmental issues. 
 There's no business model to speak of. 
 (Sighs) But what about all the pluses? What pluses? 
 We don't get accused of backflipping, there's the launch, there's the announcables at ASEAN and APEC. 
 So it's pretty much, urgh. 
 Yeah, I think it's a little more urrrgh. 
 Which is the good hand? 
 The... 
 If we go through with this, we'll be stuck with another white elephant for another 50 years. 
 Well, we've got an election in three so, urgh, evens out. 
 Yeah, well, I don't know. 
 Before you go, Tony, there's something else I have to tell you. 
 Um, there might be a few changes. 
 With the authority? 
 Yeah. 
 I just wanted to give you a heads up. 
 Can't say I didn't see it coming. 
 I can't tell you too much right now but... yep. 
 Well, thanks for letting me know. 
 Yeah, no worries. 
 You sure it's Christmas time? 
 Yes. 
 What sort of changes? 
 He didn't say, but he gets the feeling Canberra are planning a bit of a shake-up. 
 They're just sick of all the confusion over projects and agencies. 
 Can't blame them. 
 Yeah, they just wanna streamline things a little. 
 We're gone. 
 I wouldn't be surprised... given our lack of achievements. 
 We have managed to finish one thing. 
 What's that? 
 Rhonda's video. 
 I thought that was a disaster. 
 Ah, second video. 
 So we've managed to complete two promotional DVDs, but no project? 
 Yeah. 
 Says it all. 
 Voice-over : The job's not over yet. 
 A big country calls for big dreams. 
 Big vision. For our future. 
 Their future. 
 When it comes to planning for a better tomorrow, we're in safe hands, because together we are Nation Building Australia. 
 Man : Wow! 
 (Applause) 
 Well, what did you think? 
 It's an amazing series of projects we've had nothing to do with. 
 I love it! 
 Come on, everyone! 
 The margarita bar is open! 
 (Cheering) 
 I'd like to see the CSIRO party like this. 
 Jim : You know what? 
 I reckon that could go viral. 
 It screened in Canberra last night. 
 PM had tears. 
 Treasurer choked up. 
 Haven't seen him that emotional since budget estimates.

 Yeah, to our first anniversary. 
 Hugh : Guys, guys! Have a go at the pinata. What happened to the club? 
 Broke. Made of sandalwood. 
 Be there in a second. You can stab it. It's actually more effective. 
 Oh, OK. We'll be there.

 Ah, can I grab you for a word?

 Yeah, and you too, Nat.

 Did Tony mention? 
 Yeah, I gave her a heads-up. 
 So go on, put us out of our misery. 
 We're being closed down. 
 Yep! 
 Look, I totally understand. 
 I mean, this... it's madness. 
 Hey, hey, I haven't finished yet. 
 They don't want a Nation Building Authority as it currently is. 
 They want to make YOU a whole department. 
 A department?! 
 Yep! 
 Permanent? 
 Massively expand this place, roll it out in every capital city. 
 He wants you to keep doing what you're doing, but on a much larger scale. 
 Jim, we haven't built anything! 
 But it's been such a success in every other way! 
 Wow! The Department of Nation Building and Infrastructure. 
 Answerable to the PM. 
 You'll have to change your logo, of course but... 
 Woman : Here they are! 
 Happy anniversary. 
 Thanks.

 How good's this? 
 There you go. 
 I reckon that's done it. 
 Yep, that's good. 
 That's great! 
 Yeah, sorry it took a little longer. 
 No, no, that's fine. 
 If it's a job worth doing, it's worth doing right, isn't it? 
 Absolutely. 
 Yeah, don't you reckon? 
 What do you guys do? 
 Oh, we sort of plan stuff. 
 Oh, well, we do a little bit more than that. 
 Yeah, what kind of stuff? 
 Oh, well, at the moment it's mostly planning stuff but... 
 We just got nominated for an award. 
 Really? What for? 
 An integrated urban renewal program. 
 Aw, how's that going? 
 Ah, well, it hasn't... it's, um... been in the planning phase. 
 Oh, yeah. Who's it for? 
 Um, a short list of two cities. 
 Yeah, yeah. When? 
 No time frames locked in now, but it's creeping up on it. 
 Yeah.
