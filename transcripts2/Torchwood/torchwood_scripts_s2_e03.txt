 Opening shots and series recap. 
 JACK HARKNESS : (v.o.) Torchwood. Outside the Government, beyond the police. Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race. The 21st century is when everything changes... and Torchwood is ready. 
 FADE IN : 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S MILITARY HOSPITAL - 1918 - NIGHT 
 Harriet hurries down the stairs. Gerald appears a level above and peers over the banister. 
 GERALD : Nothing so far. (Harriet stops and looks at him.) You getting anything on that ? 
 HARRIET : Well, hold on a tick. 
 Harriet has a box hanging from a strap around her neck. She cranks the box and checks its readings. The box clicks like a Geiger counter. 
 HARRIET : Yes, follow me, Gerald. 
 Harriet hurries down the stairs. She stops and looks at the box readings. Gerald hurries down the stairs to catch up. He comes into view just as Harriet checks the box readings. 
 GERALD : Well ? 
 HARRIET : We're pretty close. (Points) This way. 
 Harriet is on the move again, her eyes on the box readings. A door opens and closes off screen. Gerald moves quickly down the stairs to grab Harriet. 
 GERALD : Shh ! 
 A nurse steps out of the hallway and gasps when she sees Harriet and Gerald. She drops the linens she's carrying. She gasps. 
 GERALD : Don't panic. 
 NURSE : I thought you were a ghost. Scared the wits out of me ! 
 GERALD : Sorry. (Gerald kneels to help her pick up her linens. He smiles.) Thought you'd be used to us creeping around by now. 
 HARRIET : Have you seen any recently ? Ghosts. 
 NURSE : I've seen three today. It's getting worse. 
 GERALD : Well, you're a very brave girl. 
 NURSE : Thank you, sir. 
 Harriet clears her throat loudly. 
 HARRIET : Where did you see them ? 
 NURSE : In the ward. 
 She nods pointedly behind them. Both Gerald and Harriet turn around. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S MILITARY HOSPITAL - 1918 - WARD - NIGHT 
 The box around Harriet's neck clicks as she walks through the ward. Gerald is with her. The ward is filled and busy as the nurses tend to the soldiers. 
 CAPTION : 
 ST. TEILO'S MILITARY HOSPITAL - 1918 
 They stop at one of the last beds. 
 NURSE : Mind, half of this lot see things anyway. 
 GERALD : Nerves shot to pieces. Poor chaps. 
 NURSE : Soon as they're better, they'll be sent back to the Front. 
 The young man in the bed is sleeping. 
 HARRIET : Field Marshal Haig's order. Every position must be held to the last man. Each one of us must fight on to the end.' Whenever that is. 
 The lights flicker. The men in the ward groan. Harriet's reader clicks rapidly. 
 HARRIET : Gerald. 
 Gerald looks at the reader. 
 GERALD : Come on. 
 They turn and head out of the ward. Tommy, the young man in the bed, sits up just as they're leaving. The overhead lights flicker. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S MILITARY HOSPITAL - 1918 - EAST WING - CONTINUOUS 
 Gerald comes down the stairs and stops in an empty room. Harriet is right behind him. The overhead lights flicker. Harriet's reader clicks wildly. 
 HARRIET : We're right on top of it ! 
 They look around the room. The building shakes and quivers. Gerald grabs Harriet and holds onto her. Rumbling sounds and the room brightens from an unnatural light. The rift is opening. They look and across the room, they see Toshiko with Tommy - huddled together against the far wall. Tommy is sitting on the floor while Toshiko is next to him. Gerald steps forward. 
 GERALD : Hello ? 
 TOSHIKO : (to Tommy) Tell them. 
 GERALD : Tell us what ? 
 TOSHIKO : (to Tommy) Tell them what to do. You're the only one who can stop this. If you don't, it's the end of everything ! Tommy ! 
 Tommy stands up and walks over toward Gerald and Harriet. 
 TOMMY : Take me ! I'm in there in the ward, in 1918. You have to take me so I can be here now. (Gerald and Harriet don't move.) (Demands) Just take me ! 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - 1918 - WARD 
 Gerald and Harriet head back to the bed near the end of the room. 
 GERALD : Tommy, I think you'd better come with us. 
 Tommy is sitting up in bed. Gerald moves the covers aside. 
 TOMMY (1918) : Why ? 
 GERALD : Don't worry. I'm Gerald and this is Harriet. We'll look after you. 
 TOMMY (1918) : Who are you ? 
 Gerald and Harriet look at each other. Harriet is smiling. Gerald looks at Tommy. 
 GERALD : We're Torchwood. 
 SMASH CUT TO : 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 INT. TOSHIKO'S FLAT - MORNING 
 [Music : "One of These Mornings"] 
 MONTAGE OF TOSHIKO GETTING READY FOR WORK. 
 Toshiko is standing on her bed in her white robe brushing her teeth. Toshiko checks her watch, puts it down and hurries. She puts the toast in the toaster, pours herself a cup of coffee and takes a sip of it. She puts it down on the coffee table and checks her cell phone in her bag. She puts the phone down. Toshiko grabs her clothes and puts it against herself. She puts her clothes on the couch and puts her shoes on. She takes her robe off. Grabs the toast out of the toaster and eats as she heads to her bedroom. 
 CUT TO : 
 Toshiko is dressed and her hair is done. She checks herself in her compact mirror. Satisfied, she closes her compact and smiles. Something special is happening today. She grabs her keys and her bag and heads out of the apartment. 
 LINGER ON : The calendar with FRI 20 circled in red. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
 Jack turns the calendar day over from 19 to 20. 
 GWEN : Who is he ? 
 Gwen stands in front of Jack's desk looking at an old Torchwood photo. 
 JACK : Thomas Reginald Brockless. 
 Ianto is in the back of the office. 
 IANTO : Tommy. 
 JACK : Twenty-four years-old. 
 IANTO : Sort of. 
 GWEN : Well, he's either 24 or he's not. 
 IANTO : Depends how you work it out. 
 Jack stands up just as Gwen turns to sit on the edge of the desk. 
 GWEN : All right, when was he born ? 
 JACK : 1894. 
 Jack and Ianto leave. Gwen smiles, then it hits her. 
 INT. HUB - WORKSTATIONS - CONTINUOUS 
 Jack and Ianto leave the office. 
 JACK : Owen, you ready ? 
 OWEN : (o.s.) Yeah, nearly. (Toshiko arrives at the workstations. Owen hurries out, then sees her) Is that a dress, Tosh ? 
 TOSHIKO : I do believe it is, Owen. 
 Gwen steps out of the office. 
 GWEN : Well, where is he ? 
 INT. HUB - MORGUE - CONTINUOUS 
 Jack steps up to the morgue cabinets. The others are right behind him. 
 JACK : He's been here for ninety years, longer than any of us. Any of you. 
 Jack opens the cabinet and pulls out the cryogenic chamber. 
 TOSHIKO : Torchwood have used alien cryogenics since Victorian times. They froze Tommy in 1918. 
 They gather around Tommy. 
 JACK : So he's 24 or 114 years old. I know which one I'd choose. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - AUTOPSY / COLD STORAGE 
 Tommy is now out of the chamber and on the table. He is still unconscious. Owen is working on him while Toshiko stands next to the table. 
 OWEN : We have to wake him up every twelve months or so. Well, defrost him. One day only, then back in the freezer. 
 Gwen stands on the stairs, her back to the wall. 
 GWEN : Why ? 
 Ianto and Jack are watching from above. 
 IANTO : Check he still works. 
 JACK : One day, we're gonna need him. 
 Owen sets the hypodermic against Tommy's neck. The heart monitor gives off one steady beep. 
 OWEN : Right, everybody ready ? 
 Everyone's ready. Owen injects Tommy, then waits for a pulse. 
 OWEN : Come on, Tommy. 
 The heart monitor continues to flatline. It's too long. Owen grabs the defibrilator paddles. 
 OWEN : Charging 200, clear ! 
 He zaps Tommy. The heart monitor continues to flatline. 
 OWEN : Charging 360. Clear ! 
 Owen zaps Tommy again. Tommy gasps and his eyes open suddenly. He immediately starts struggling against Owen. Ianto steps forward to help subdue Tommy. 
 OWEN : Gwen, quick. (Gwen steps forward and takes the paddles.) It's all right ! 
 TOMMY : Get off me, leave me alone. 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy ! 
 TOMMY : Leave me alone ! 
 OWEN : Tommy ! 
 Tommy punches Owen in the face and Owen falls backward. 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy, listen to me ! Tommy Brockless ! (He stops struggling and stares at Toshiko.) It's me, Toshiko. 
 TOMMY : Toshiko... 
 TOSHIKO : Remember ? 
 TOMMY : Gets harder every year. 
 IANTO : Good left hook, though. 
 TOSHIKO : Do you know where you are ? 
 He sits up and looks around. 
 TOMMY : Torchwood. 
 TOSHIKO : That's right. 
 TOMMY : Is it time again ? (She nods.) Blimey. 
 TOSHIKO : How are you feeling ? 
 He coughs. 
 TOMMY : I could murder a cup of tea. 
 Owen smiles and pats Tommy on the shoulders. Toshiko grins and turns to Ianto who is also smiling, until he remembers the cup of tea remark and turns to go get one.) 
 INT. HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM 
 Everyone is in the conference room having a cup of tea while Tommy eats a full meal. 
 IANTO : Don't expect the best china... 
 TOMMY : I'm starving. 
 IANTO : ...visitors only. 
 TOMMY : Here, tuck in. There's enough to feed an army. 
 JACK : (b.g.) We should do this every morning. Breakfast, I mean. 
 TOMMY : (to Toshiko) Hmm. Nice dress. 
 TOSHIKO : Thank you. 
 TOMMY : Got your slacks on underneath. Is it that cold outside ? 
 IANTO : It's the fashion this year. 
 TOMMY : (grinning) 1968, they were in miniskirts. Thought all my Christmases had come at once. Shame they haven't made a comeback. 
 Gwen turns to Jack. 
 GWEN : I still don't get it. Why is he here ? 
 JACK : Like I said - one day, we're gonna need him. 
 INT. HUB - AUTOPSY BAY / MEDICAL AREA 
 Owen holds Tommy's wrists as he gives Tommy a basic physical. Toshiko waits with a clipboard. 
 OWEN : And pull to me. (He releases Tommy's wrists.) Good. Seems fine. (He turns to get a vial.) I just need to, uh, take a few... blood samples. 
 TOMMY : Blood samples. 
 Toshiko smiles. 
 TOSHIKO : We wake you up once a year and stick needles into you, it's not fair. 
 TOMMY : Once a year for you, it's every day for me. 
 TOSHIKO : So, while we wait. 
 Owen collects blood. 
 TOMMY : Tommy Reginald Brockless, born 1894 February the 7th in Blackley, Manchester. Private officer in 10th West Yorkshire regiment. 
 TOSHIKO : Very good. 
 TOMMY : Only son of Constance May Bassett, died 1900, and Thomas Campbell Brockless, died June 1931, aged 57. Heart attack. That's right, isn't it ? 
 TOSHIKO : Yes. I'm sorry. 
 TOMMY : It's all right. I just haven't had that much time to get used to it. 
 OWEN : Right, I need to have a look at this leg. 
 INT. HUB - JACK'S OFFICE 
 Jack talks with Gwen. 
 JACK : St. Teilo's Hospital, 1918. There was a time-shift. A fracture in the rift means that two slices of time were erupting into each other. 
 GWEN : A slice of 1918, and... ? 
 JACK : A slice of the future. But we don't know exactly what slice. It could be tomorrow, it could be in a hundred years' time. 
 GWEN : What will happen ? 
 JACK : Chunks of 1918 will start to appear at the hospital. A few at first, then more and more. When the time-shift is complete, it'll start a chain reaction. (Jack gets up.) Unless we stop it, time-shifts will start happening all over the country, then all over the world. 
 Gwen looks at the profile and picture of Tommy. Jack opens one of the locked cabinets. 
 GWEN : But how does Tommy fit in ? 
 JACK : He helps to stop it somehow. (Jack takes out a canister.) Torchwood 1918 left us sealed orders. 
 Gwen reads the label instructions on the sealed can. 
 GWEN : "Eyes-only documents. FAO Torchwood, commander overseeing case 1918 TB." T... Tommy Brockless ? 
 Jack nods. She tries to open it. 
 GWEN : Okay. It's stuck. 
 JACK : No, it's locked. 
 GWEN : Okay, where's the key ? 
 JACK : It's a temporal lock tied in with the rift frequencies at the hospital. (Gwen rolls her eyes and sits down at the desk. She switches out a slide on the old desktop light box with another slide.) When the rift nears completion, the box will open and we'll find out exactly what Tommy does. 
 GWEN : But why would they keep us in the dark, Jack ? 
 JACK : I guess we'll find that out, too. 
 Tommy and Toshiko walk into the office. Tommy is wearing contemporary street clothing. 
 TOSHIKO : Ta-dah ! 
 TOMMY : Seriously, what do you think ? 
 GWEN : You look like a film star. 
 TOMMY : Who ? Charlie Chaplin ? 
 Gwen giggles. 
 TOSHIKO : (amused) Come on. 
 Toshiko and Tommy leave the office. Jack and Gwen get up and quickly follow. 
 INT. HUB - WORKSTATIONS 
 Gwen and Jack linger at the office doorway. 
 GWEN : Jack ? Have you got any more of those pretty boys in the freezer ? 
 They watch as Tommy helps Toshiko put her coat on. 
 JACK : Hands off, missy. Tosh got there first. 
 Toshiko looks at everyone. 
 TOSHIKO : Thanks for holding the fort while I'm out. 
 OWEN : No worries. Have fun. Be careful. 
 GWEN : Where are you off ? 
 TOSHIKO : A drink, film ? Maybe a pizza. 
 GWEN : (both) Oh, very nice. 
 JACK : (both) Aw, very nice. 
 TOSHIKO : I'll be on the mobile if you need me. 
 GWEN : Have a lovely time. 
 JACK : Bye ! 
 Toshiko and Tommy head out. 
 GWEN : He's a frozen soldier from 1918. 
 JACK : Nobody's perfect. 
 EXT. CHURCH COURTYARD - DAY 
 Toshiko hurries to keep up with Tommy as they cross a courtyard in front of a little white church. 
 TOSHIKO : Slow down, what's the hurry ? 
 TOMMY : I've only got one day, I want to see everything. 
 They stop in front of a large statue. 
 TOSHIKO : Captain Scott... sailed from here, when he went off to the Antarctic. 
 TOMMY : 1910. I was 16, papers were full of it. Took him two years to get there and then he snuffed it. So, what've you been up to since I last saw you ? 
 They walk over to the railing overlooking the bay. 
 TOSHIKO : Oh... this and that. Work, mostly. 
 Tommy laughs. 
 TOSHIKO : What ? 
 TOMMY : I knew you were going to say that. It's what you always say. So how's the piano playing going ? That's what you said last year, remember ? "I'm gonna learn the piano." 
 TOSHIKO : Never got round to it. 
 TOMMY : I bet you never learnt Spanish, neither. 
 TOSHIKO : I bought a book, though ! 
 TOMMY : Oh, are you made of money ? 
 TOSHIKO : I haven't had time. 
 TOMMY : You talk about your life like you've got no control over it. 
 TOSHIKO : Well, Torchwood's pretty much 24/7. Twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week. 
 TOMMY : But you weren't conscripted. I mean, it's your choice, right ? 
 TOSHIKO : Yeah... I suppose it is. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
 Gwen and Ianto look at an old slide of Gerald and Harriet standing in the hub under the Torchwood sign. 
 GWEN : He's a bit of all right. 
 IANTO : He's the boss. 
 GWEN : Nothing changes. 
 They look at each other and laughs a little. 
 IANTO : She's all right, too. Harriet Derbyshire. 
 GWEN : I wonder what happened to her. 
 IANTO : She died the year after that was taken. Twenty-six years old. 
 GWEN : So young. 
 IANTO : They all were. (He picks up another slide with five people in it.) Nothing changes. 
 Gwen gets up and heads out of the office. 
 IANTO : Where are you going ? 
 GWEN : St. Teilo's Hospital. And bloody cheer up, will you ? 
 INT. PUB - DAY 
 Tommy takes his shot at the billiards table. 
 TOSHIKO : Good shot ! 
 TOMMY : You're still winning. 
 He hands the pool stick to Toshiko. 
 TOSHIKO : It's all just maths, really. Angles, velocity... 
 TOMMY : Yeah. Give you women a vote, equal rights, look what happens, eh ? So, eh, you got a boyfriend yet ? 
 She shoots and hands the stick to Tommy. 
 TOSHIKO : You sound like my mother. 
 TOMMY : Ah, so you haven't, then. 
 TOSHIKO : You had a girlfriend ? In 1918. 
 TOMMY : Yeah. Ellie. We courted for two years. 
 TOSHIKO : What happened ? 
 TOMMY : I, uh, stopped seeing her... last time I was home on leave. The war changed me. I couldn't just carry on like before. 
 TOSHIKO : I'm sorry. 
 TOMMY : Right pair we make. 
 They look at each other. Tommy goes to make his shot. Toshiko sips from her drink. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY 
 Gwen walks through the dark hallway. The place is eerily quiet. She looks through the rooms as she passes by them. She enters through the double doors into an empty ward. There's a sign over her head : ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL. Wings flap of screen. Gwen turns to look. She continues through the large empty ward. She stops and turns to look back. Something happens and shifts a little. She doesn't notice and continues through the room. Suddenly, she stops. A man with an amputated lower right leg and crutches is in front of her. The lights on in the room flicker. 
 GWEN : Hello. 
 The man doesn't answer her. 
 GWEN : I said hello. 
 Again, there is no answer. The man on the crutches starts walking toward her. He shows no sign of stopping. Gwen backs away. The man continues toward her. She backs away 
 GWEN : You hear me ? Look, can you hear me ? (Her back hits the wall as the man is nearly upon her.) If you just, just... 
 She hands up. The man is gone. She looks around. There's no sign of the man. Anywhere. Gwen thinks about it, then heads out of the room. She starts running back through the corridor, checking the rooms for any sign of the man. She leaves the hallway. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - BACK ROOM - DAY 
 Gwen comes upon another ward. This one appears to be under construction - with plastic sheeting up on the windows and back door with ladders and metal pieces on the floor. Gwen starts through the room. She thinks she hears something, stop and looks back behind her. She continues through the room. She hears wings flutter off screen and turns. She continues through the room toward the back door. 
 GWEN : Hello ? 
 There's no answer. She notices the lights in the room flickering. She reaches up and taps the lamp. She fiddles with the light switch. The lights continue to flicker. The lights go out. Gwen looks around. A door slams shut behind her, startling her already heightened senses. Three construction workers are in the room with her. 
 FOREMAN : Are you all right, love ? You look as if you've seen a ghost. 
 Gwen looks sheepish. 
 LATER : 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - WARD - DAY 
 Gwen and Jack are in the ward. They're standing at opposite ends of the room. Jack looks around. 
 JACK : They're knocking down the hospital. 
 GWEN : Yeah, that's what they said. Could that have triggered the time-shift ? 
 JACK : Could have. Maybe all the psychic trauma and rift energy charged it up like a battery. 1918, this place was full of wounded soldiers. 
 Jack crouches low to the ground, placing his right hand flat on the floor as if feeling the essence of the room. 
 JACK : They had four years of it. Passchendaele, the Somme... A million British soldiers killed during the Great War. It was like walking into hell. 
 He dusts his hands off quickly and stands up. 
 JACK : Believe me. I was there. (to comm) Owen ? You got anything ? 
 INTERCUT WITH : 
 INT. THE HUB - WORKSTATIONS - DAY 
 Owen is working the computers. 
 OWEN : All quiet here. Just that little spike from earlier. Look. This is more Tosh's thing than mine. Shall I give her a call ? 
 JACK : Not yet. Just keep watching. 
 Jack and Gwen head for the door. 
 INT. PUB - DAY 
 Tommy walks up to the counter. 
 BARTENDER : (o.s.) Yes, mate. 
 TOMMY : Half a bitter, and a vodka and diet tonic with a slice of lemon, please. 
 He turns and smiles at Toshiko. She nods back. Sounds from the television set catches his attention and he watches news of the war. His smile fades. 
 REPORTER : (from tv) An Iraqi soldier and at least twenty Iraqi civilians have been killed by a roadside bomb in Basra Saturday night. Soldiers on routine patrol - civilians were taken to a nearby hospital. 
 Toshiko gets up and goes over to stand next to him.) 
 TOSHIKO : Iraq. 
 TOMMY : Seems like there's always a war somewhere. 
 TOSHIKO : It's not exactly a war. 
 TOMMY : It looks like one. The first year they woke me up... 1919... they told me it was all over. We won. The war to end all wars, they said. And then three weeks later, you had the Second World War. After all that. 
 He gets their drinks and heads back to their table. They sit down. 
 TOMMY : Do you never wonder if we're worth saving ? The human race. 
 TOSHIKO : Yes. I think we're worth saving. Wars and all. (He smiles at her.) What ? (He's suddenly very shy.) What ? 
 TOMMY : I was just thinking... I'd do anything for you. Yeah, all you have to do is say, "Tommy, you're my brave, handsome hero, and I need you." 
 He laughs. 
 TOSHIKO : Is that all ? 
 TOMMY : And whatever it is, I'll do it. I mean it. Anything. 
 They're suddenly very serious. There's a small swooshing sound. Tommy grimaces from a pain in his head. 
 TOSHIKO : What is it ? 
 TOMMY : I dunno. I just felt something... 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - DAY 
 The ST. TELIO'S sign is in the dumpster. It's old and rusted from the wires. The builder takes a sledgehammer and punches a hole in the back wall. Sunlight bursts through the hole. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY 
 Jack and Gwen walk through the dark hallway. Jack hears something. He stops and turns around. 
 GWEN : Jack ? 
 Jack motions for her to be quiet as he listens. 
 GWEN : Jack. 
 JACK : Shh ! (He motions for her to continue on.) Go ahead. 
 Gwen continues. Jack turns and heads back. He turns the corner and turns his flashlight on. As soon as he hears the singing, he turns and looks back. 
 VOICE : (singing) Tick-tock, wind up the clock /I like them all... 
 A nurse pushing a patient in a wheelchair appears at the end of the corridor. 
 NURSE : I bet you say that to all the girls. 
 WHEELCHAIR PATIENT : (singing) Show me a skirt, and my brain simply whirls... 
 The nurse continues to push the wheelchair patient through the corridor. They head toward Jack and show no sign of seeing him there. 
 NURSE : Shh ! Matron won't have singing. You'll get a good telling off if she hears you. 
 WHEELCHAIR PATIENT : (singing) I love their dimples and curls (The nurse giggles.) /Tick-tock, wind up the clock /And I start my day over again. 
 Jack's flashlight beam hits the nurse and the wheelchair patient. 
 WHEELCHAIR PATIENT : (singing) Tick-tock, wind up the clock /And I start my day over again... 
 The nurse laughs. They pass by Jack without noticing him. Jack watches them as they turn the corner. The nurse giggles. 
 OWEN : (over comm) Jack, you see anything ? Cos I've got little mountain rises here. 
 JACK : (to comm) Yeah, we've got a few ghosts here. 
 Jack checks on Gwen. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
 JACK : (from comm) Gwen, you okay ? 
 Gwen is walking through a dark corridor. She doesn't have a flashlight with her. 
 JACK : (from comm) Gwen ? 
 GWEN : I'm fine. 
 Gwen enters a very dark room. She turns the ceiling light on. It flickers. Gwen continues through the room. She turns to cover her own back and continues on. The lights continue to flicker. Gwen reaches the other end of the room and steps out into the hallway. She stops, her eyes wide as she sees a man sitting in a chair in the hallway, his elbows on his knees as if he's been waiting there a long time. A nurse walks past her and heads for the man in the chair. 
 NURSE : They're ready for you now. 
 The man gets up. The nurse turns and leaves around the corner. Gwen turns and looks around. In the background, the nurse has stepped backward and peers around the corner directly at Gwen. The nurse can see her there. Gwen hasn't noticed the nurse looking at her yet. Gwen turns and sees the nurse look directly at her. The nurse starts to head hesitantly toward Gwen. Thinking she's looking at something else, Gwen turns to see who she might be looking at. There's no one there. The lights flicker. 
 NURSE : (to Gwen) Hello ? 
 Gwen doesn't answer her. 
 NURSE : (to Gwen) Hello ? 
 The nurse continues toward Gwen. 
 NURSE : (to Gwen) I see you. 
 Gwen backs away from her. 
 NURSE : Why won't you leave us alone ? You shouldn't be here ! 
 Gwen puts her arms our in front of her as she backs away back into the room. The nurse continues toward her. 
 GWEN : I don't mean you any harm. 
 NURSE : You shouldn't be here ! You shouldn't be here ! 
 GWEN : I don't mean you any harm. Shh ! 
 The lights turn back on and the nurse is gone ! Only the echoes of her yelling is distorted through time. Gwen's arms are out in front of her and holding back nothing but air. She puts her arms down and looks around. 
 EXT. DOCKS - DAY 
 Tommy chases Toshiko along the wooden docks. 
 TOMMY : I'm going to get you ! 
 TOSHIKO : Stop, stop, no. Please, no, Tommy, no. 
 Tommy scoops Toshiko up over his shoulders. She drops her bag. 
 TOSHIKO : Stop ! 
 TOMMY : It's a fireman's lift. (He carries her in a circle.) I'm not putting you down. (He laughs.) I'm putting you down. 
 He puts her down. She drops her bag. They're smiling and looking at each other. He steps forward and kisses her quickly on the lips. Toshiko's caught off guard. 
 TOMMY : What ? 
 TOSHIKO : Nothing. Thanks. 
 TOMMY : "Thanks ?" 
 TOSHIKO : It just caught me out. It doesn't matter. 
 TOMMY : What ? 
 Toshiko picks up her bag and heads over to the bench. She sits down. 
 TOSHIKO : I know it's silly... but I'm a bit older than you. 
 TOMMY : I was born in 1894. 
 TOSHIKO : You know what I mean. 
 He sits down next to her. 
 TOMMY : So I'm old enough to die for my country but I'm too young to give you a kiss ? You daft lass. What goes on in that head of yours ? 
 She kisses him quickly on the lips. 
 TOMMY : Thanks. 
 TOSHIKO : You're welcome. 
 TOMMY : I might be young, but I've seen a fair bit in my time. 
 TOSHIKO : So what do you want to do now ? 
 TOMMY : Well, we could go back to mine but there's only room for one and it's bloody freezing. 
 She chuckles, but he's serious. 
 TOSHIKO : You want to come back to my place ? 
 TOMMY : I'm hardly rushing you. You've known me four years. 
 TOSHIKO : Four days... 
 They lean forward and kiss. 
 TOSHIKO : Okay. Let's go. 
 TOMMY : I'll race you. (He stands up and runs. Toshiko starts running after him.) Come on ! 
 Her phone rings. Toshiko stops and answers it. 
 TOSHIKO : (to phone) Jack. 
 Tommy stops running and turns around. He motions to her. 
 TOMMY : Toshiko ! 
 Toshiko listens to phone. Her smile fades. 
 TOSHIKO : (to phone) We're on our way. 
 She hangs up. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
 Jack meets with Gwen, Owen, Toshiko and Tommy. 
 JACK : Demolishing the hospital is what triggers the time-shift. 
 OWEN : So, don't demolish it. 
 JACK : Too late, it's already started. 
 GWEN : What happens next ? 
 Tommy stares at Toshiko. She turns and glances at him. 
 JACK : Two different times should never exist simultaneously. You want to be in 1918, or now. Not both. 
 TOSHIKO : So when 1918 becomes fully manifest... 
 OWEN : It's really going to screw us up. 
 Jack picks up a single sheet of paper to demonstrate. He shows it to them. 
 JACK : Okay... Linear time. (He crumples the paper into a ball.) Screwed up time. 
 He throws the paper ball at Owen who catches it. 
 JACK : Imagine your life as a straight line, from birth to death. Now, try drawing that line on the paper without straightening it out. 
 GWEN : It's impossible. 
 JACK : That's why we've got to stop it. 
 Jack is on the move. He heads out. Toshiko gets up and exits the room. 
 INT. HUB - MAIN FLOOR 
 JACK : (shouts) Ianto ! Is that box doing anything yet ? 
 Ianto steps out of Jack's office carrying the canister. 
 IANTO : Still locked. 
 Jack, Gwen, Owen, Toshiko and Tommy head for the workstations. 
 JACK : Okay. We need to find out how fast the time-shift is happening. Get some idea when it's going to complete. Tosh, Owen, go to the hospital. We need readings. Cover the place with rift monitors. Gwen, go through the files, see if there's anything we missed. 
 Toshiko grabs her jacket to go to the hospital. Tommy stops and looks at her. Their eyes meet. Toshiko leaves. 
 
 
 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - WARD - DAY 
 Toshiko is in the large empty ward kneeling in front of an open case. Owen walks in and puts his case down. 
 OWEN : Need a hand ? 
 TOSHIKO : Just a couple more. 
 She tosses him a reader. He catches it and goes to the wall to set it up. 
 OWEN : Listen, Tosh, I've been meaning to say... uh, just be careful. 
 TOSHIKO : What do you mean ? 
 OWEN : You're very close to Tommy. 
 TOSHIKO : I've only known him for four days. 
 OWEN : Yeah. You've fallen for him, haven't you ? 
 TOSHIKO : I can be myself with him. I don't have to pretend. 
 OWEN : No, I understand. I-I didn't think you had some weird fetish for defrosted men. I just, um... I don't want you to get hurt, that's all... if you have to say goodbye. 
 Toshiko understands. 
 GWEN : (over Owen's comm) Owen, can you hear me ? 
 OWEN : (to comm) What is it ? 
 GWEN : (over comm) I need you to go down into the east wing of the hospital, head for the second floor, what used to be the radiology section. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - EAST WING - DAY 
 GWEN : (over comm) I think that area contains a clue to the time-shift. I read this earlier, but it didn't make any sense. 
 INTERCUT WITH : 
 INT. THE HUB - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
 Gwen is looking through the files. 
 GWEN : In the Torchwood 1918 field report at the hospital, they describe a certain detail of their encounter. 
 Owen stops in the middle of the large empty room as he listens. 
 GWEN : It reads... "Through a hole in the external wall, we hear the roar of great engines. Outside is a woman in strange armor, ripping a Union jack, perhaps some future heroine of the Empire." 
 Owen sits on his haunches in the middle of the room as he thinks. 
 GWEN : I mean, what does it mean ? It doesn't sound like us now, I mean - the time-shift has started, but maybe it doesn't complete until - well, years in the future. 
 Owen gets up and goes to the back storage room. He looks around. He sees something off screen. 
 OWEN : Got it ! 
 Owen moves a chair to climb up the counter to look out of the hole in the back of the wall. He sees the mural on the wall on the other building. 
 OWEN : It's, uh, it's some kind of advert. It's, uh, for car insurance. That sound they heard must have been traffic. It's not years in the future... it's now. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - WARD - DAY 
 Toshiko is alone in the large empty room. The rift monitor alarms start to beep. Toshiko heads over to some of the monitors. Suddenly, the alarm blares and the lamp lights flash. Toshiko hurries out. 
 INT. HUB - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
 Jack is working at his desk, the Torchwood sealed canister on the desktop in front of him. Wisps of golden riftlight unseal the canister. Jack puts his pen down and removes the papers from the canister. He breaks the Torchwood seal, opens the envelope and removes the papers inside. He reads through the handwritten letter. Ianto steps into the office and sees Jack reading. 
 IANTO : Instructions ? 
 JACK : Yeah, for Tommy. 
 He reads onto the next page and stops. 
 JACK : And Toshiko. 
 INT. HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
 Jack meets with Toshiko, Gwen, Owen and Tommy. He has the letter and another circular object near him. 
 JACK : In twelve hours, there'll be a brief moment when both times exist, before the time-shift completes, when Tommy can be here now, and in 1918. He needs to be in the hospital, ready to step from one time to another. 
 GWEN : So he'd be right inside the time-shift ? 
 JACK : And he can close the fracture that caused it. 
 TOMMY : And when the fracture's closed ? 
 OWEN : 1918 will be back where it belongs. 
 TOMMY : So will I. 
 Jack nods. 
 TOMMY : For good ? 
 JACK : Yeah. You're the only one who can do this. We brought you from 1918 to now, and when you go back to 1918, your life will be like a thread, stitching time back together again. 
 TOMMY : A stitch in time. 
 TOSHIKO : How ? 
 Jack picks up the circular object. 
 JACK : This is a rift manipulator. It's basically a key. Once you're inside the time-shift, you can close the door behind you. 
 TOMMY : And that's it ? I'm gone ? 
 Tommy turns and looks at Toshiko. Everyone is quiet. The door opens and Ianto walks in carrying large box. 
 JACK : Tommy, stay with Ianto. Tosh, with me. 
 Jack picks up the things and heads out. Toshiko looks at Tommy. She gets up quickly and follows Jack out. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
 Jack talks with Toshiko. 
 TOSHIKO : What happens to him ? 
 JACK : Three weeks after we send Tommy back, he dies. 
 TOSHIKO : How ? 
 JACK : He's shot by a firing squad. 
 TOSHIKO : I don't understand. 
 JACK : In 1918, Tommy was suffering from shell shock. That's why he was in the hospital. When Torchwood took him and froze him, they froze his most recent memories. When he returns to 1918, he'll revert back to who he was. He'll be shell-shocked and so he'll be executed by the British Army for cowardice. 
 TOSHIKO : They can't shoot him for that. 
 JACK : Lots of soldiers who were shell-shocked recovered enough to be sent back to the Front. But once they were there... they broke down again. 
 TOSHIKO : So they kill him ? 
 JACK : More than three hundred of them. 
 TOSHIKO : Then we can't send him back. 
 JACK : We have to. 
 TOSHIKO : I can't do that. 
 JACK : Yes, you can. He trusts you. 
 TOSHIKO : To send him to his death ? 
 JACK : To help him save the future. It has to be you. 
 Jack shows her the page of the letter - a sketch of Toshiko. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM 
 Ianto opens the box. 
 IANTO : We've kept these in the archives. You were wearing them in the hospital when Torchwood took you. 
 Tommy takes out his jacket and looks at it. 
 TOMMY : Good job the moths haven't got into them. 
 He takes out his pajama bottoms. 
 TOMMY : So I'll be saving the world in some pyjamas ? How daft is that ? 
 INT. HUB - JACK'S OFFICE 
 Toshiko takes the sketch. 
 JACK : Torchwood 1918 saw you with Tommy in the hospital, telling him what to do. I know you. You're strong enough to do this. 
 He gives her the letter. 
 TOSHIKO : Does Tommy know what happens to him ? 
 JACK : No. 
 TOSHIKO : If he asks me, what do I say ? 
 INT. HUB - WORKSTATIONS 
 Tommy carries the box and puts it down by the couch. 
 TOMMY : Where's Toshiko ? 
 GWEN : Still in with Jack. 
 TOMMY : So... tomorrow morning. (Ianto nods.) What time is it now ? 
 Gwen checks her watch. Ianto checks his watch. 
 IANTO : Ten to nine. 
 TOMMY : So what do we do till then ? 
 Everyone is very quiet and looks at each other. 
 TOMMY : (scoffs) You don't know, do you ? 
 GWEN : What would you like to do ? 
 TOMMY : The night before we went over the top, we used to play cards, write letters. Have a drink, if anyone had some. 
 He sits down. 
 OWEN : Yeah, well, we could do that. 
 IANTO : Yeah. 
 Ianto turns to get it. 
 TOMMY : But you're not coming with me. I'm going on my own. 
 Again, everyone is quiet. Toshiko exits the office and passes them on her way to her workstation. She's very quiet. Jack lingers against the office doorframe. 
 GWEN : We were just wondering what, um, Tommy should do tonight. 
 TOSHIKO: He can come home with me. 
 Everyone turns to look at Toshiko. 
 TOSHIKO : He's not our prisoner; he doesn't have to stay here. Does he ? 
 JACK : No. (to Tommy) If that's what you both want. 
 Toshiko and Tommy look at each other. 
 JACK : Tomorrow morning, 6:30. 
 Everyone starts moving again. Tommy hands the box back to Ianto as Toshiko gets her things. Jack watches them from his office doorway. 
 INT. TOSHIKO'S FLAT - NIGHT 
 The apartment is dark. The lights turn on. Toshiko and Tommy enter 
 TOSHIKO : Come in. 
 TOMMY : You're very neat. 
 TOSHIKO : Yes. Well, there's only me here. 
 TOMMY : And me. Just for tonight. Then I'll be gone. 
 TOSHIKO : I never thought it would really happen. 
 TOMMY : I won't even be able to write to you. You're going to be so far away. 
 TOSHIKO : I worried you'd see me getting older. 
 Suddenly, they're kissing. It's 23:59. It's midnight. 
 INT. HUB - JACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
 Jack is in the office sorting through some papers. Behind him, Ianto comes up the stairs. 
 JACK : This time tomorrow, he'll be back in 1918. 
 Ianto lingers by the railing in the dark. 
 IANTO : In his own time. Would you go back to yours ? If you could ? 
 JACK : Why, would you miss me ? 
 IANTO : Yep. 
 Ianto moves in closer. 
 JACK : I left home a long time ago. I don't really know where I really belong. Maybe that doesn't matter anymore. 
 IANTO : I - don't you get lonely. 
 Ianto sits on the edge of Jack's desk. 
 JACK : Going home wouldn't fix that. Being here, I've seen things I never dreamt I'd see. Loved people I never would have known if I'd just stayed where I was. 
 Jack and Ianto's eyes meet. 
 JACK : And I wouldn't change that for the world. 
 Ianto moves in and they kiss. 
 INT. TOSHIKO'S FLAT - NIGHT 
 Toshiko and Tommy are in bed, post-coital. Toshiko's eyes are open. She turns and looks at the clock. It's 02:00. Tommy's awake as well. 
 TOMMY : What did he tell you ? What happens to me ? 
 TOSHIKO : They send you back to France. 
 TOMMY : Then what ? (She doesn't answer him.) Do they find my body ? 
 She touches his cheek and still doesn't answer him. She nods. 
 TOMMY : Well, that's something. 
 He leans forward and kisses her. 
 EXT. CARDIFF BAY (STOCK) - DAY 
 Establish time. 
 INT. TOSHIKO'S FLAT - DAY 
 It's morning. Toshiko is in her white robe. She watches Tommy in bed. He wakes up and looks at her. 
 TOSHIKO : It's time. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - BIG EMPTY ROOM - DAY 
 Gwen, Owen, Jack, Toshiko and Tommy enter the ward. Gwen and Owen put the kits they're carrying down. Toshiko hands Tommy the rift manipulator. 
 JACK : (sighs) You know we can't be here when it happens. 
 Tommy nods. The rift alarms blare. The building shakes. Tommy tries to be brave and steps forward and away from the group. Toshiko follows him. 
 TOSHIKO : Come on. 
 They continue through the hospital. The others follow. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY 
 They're walking through the corridor. Suddenly, Tommy stops them. 
 TOMMY : Shh ! 
 They hear the echoing sounds of someone singing. 
 JACK : We're safe for now. 
 A nurse carrying a lit lamp turns the corner in front of them and walks down the hallway. Tommy starts following her. Toshiko follows him. 
 TOSHIKO : Are you all right ? (Tommy starts running.) Tommy ! 
 They enter the ward. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - WARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
 Tommy looks around. The nurse is gone. 
 TOMMY : Where is she ? 
 Everyone is quiet as they watch him. 
 TOMMY : In 1918 ? 
 Tommy remembers. 
 GERALD : (echoy, distorted, faint) Tommy, I think you'd better come with us. Don't worry. I'm Gerald, this is Harriet. We'll look after you. 
 TOMMY : Torchwood took me. 
 INSERT : 
 It's night. Tommy is asleep in the ward back in 1918. Tommy is standing at the bed watching himself sleep. 
 TOSHIKO : (faint) Tommy ? 
 Tommy turns and sees Toshiko standing right behind him. He sees everyone there. It's too much for him. He shakes his head and runs out of the room. We note the lights in the room flickering. 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy ! 
 Toshiko runs after him. 
 JACK : (to the others) Stay here. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - EAST WING - DAY 
 Tommy stops in the back room. Toshiko rushes in. 
 TOMMY : (distressed) I won't do it. I can't go back. 
 JACK : You've got to. 
 TOMMY : No ! I know what'll happen. They'll send me back to the Front. I'll be back in the trenches. (to Toshiko) Help me. 
 TOSHIKO : You've got to go. 
 TOMMY : Why me ?! 
 He deliberately drops the rift manipulator. 
 TOMMY : You're no better than the generals. Sitting safely behind the lines, sending us over the top. Any one of you lot could go, but you're not, are you? You're sending me. 
 JACK : We belong here. 
 TOSHIKO : I'm sorry. 
 TOMMY : I've been shoved from pillar to post all my life by the Army, by Torchwood. 
 Tommy advances toward Jack, Jack holds up his hands to stop him. 
 JACK : Hey, hey. 
 Tommy turns and looks at Toshiko. 
 TOMMY : All this time I've had, it means nothing. 
 Tommy goes to the back wall and leans against it. He slides till he sits completely on the floor, huddled against the wall. Toshiko's heart goes out to him. Jack heads over. He kneels and grabs Tommy's arm. 
 JACK : Tommy. 
 TOMMY : (shakes him off) Get off. 
 JACK : Tommy, get up. 
 TOMMY : No ! 
 TOSHIKO : Leave us alone. Please. 
 Jack gets up. He puts a hand on Toshiko's shoulder on his way out. 
 JACK : You've got two minutes. 
 Jack leaves. Toshiko picks up the rift manipulator and walks over to Tommy. She kneels and puts her hand on his shoulder. He pulls away from her. She moves in closer anyway. 
 TOSHIKO : Listen, you're a hero. Do you know that ? (He looks at her.) Because you stop the time-shift and save everyone. You save us all. 
 TOMMY : I can't do it. 
 She sighs. 
 TOSHIKO : We need you. 
 TOMMY : I don't want to be a hero. I want to stay here with you. 
 The Rift rumbles and an unnatural wind blows. Toshiko turns and looks behind her. The sounds get louder and louder. Tommy and Toshiko hold onto each other. A very bright light shines forcing them to cover their eyes. When the sounds subside, they look up. 
 GERALD : (o.s.) Hello ? 
 Gerald and Harriet are there. Toshiko looks at Tommy. 
 TOSHIKO : (to Tommy) Tell them. 
 GERALD : Tell us what ? 
 TOSHIKO : (to Tommy) Tell them what to do. You're the only one who can stop this. If you don't, if you don't, it's the end of everything. 
 Tommy doesn't move. 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy ! 
 He looks down at the Rift manipulator, then gets up quickly. He heads over to Gerald and Harriet. 
 TOMMY : Take me ! I'm in there in the ward in 1918. You have to take me so I can be here now. (Gerald and Harriet don't move.) (demands) Just take me ! 
 The Rift roaring and winds stir up again. The lights get extremely bright. When it subsides, Tommy and Toshiko are back in the future. Toshiko looks at Tommy. He's much calmer. 
 TOMMY : I'll be gone soon. 
 She nods. 
 TOSHIKO : Remember... the rift key. Use it. 
 She glances at the door, then she kisses him. 
 TOSHIKO : You've got to get back into bed. Like you've never been away. Then use the key. Tommy ? Remember, hmm. (They again glance toward the door.) It's nearly time. 
 They nod at each other. The crunching, roaring sounds start up again. Tommy takes the key and starts toward the door. He turns and looks back at Toshiko. An unnatural wind blows and Tommy heads for the door. The extremely bright light shines as Toshiko watches. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - 1918 - EAST WING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
 Tommy is in a storage room. He looks around and clutches the rift key. The nurse finds him there. 
 NURSE : What are you doing ? You shouldn't be in here. 
 The nurse pushes Tommy toward the door. She pulls the linen off the shelf, glances back at the room and heads out after him. 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY - PRESENT 
 Jack, Owen, Gwen and Ianto turn the corner and start down the corridor. Toshiko runs toward them. 
 TOSHIKO : Go, go ! 
 Everyone turns and runs the other way. Toshiko stops and looks back. Jack grabs her arm and pulls her with him. 
 JACK : Come on ! 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - 1918 - WARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
 Gerald and Harriet head back to the bed near the end of the room. Tommy is sitting up in bed. 
 GERALD : Tommy, I think you'd better come with us. 
 Gerald moves the covers aside. 
 TOMMY (1918) : Why ? 
 GERALD : Don't worry. I'm Gerald, this is Harriet. We'll look after you. 
 TOMMY (1918) : Who are you ? 
 GERALD : We're Torchwood. 
 Tommy starts to get up. 
 TOMMY (1918) : Where are we going ? 
 GERALD : Somewhere safe. Trust me. 
 Tommy gets out of bed and puts his jacket on. Gerald and Harriet move Tommy along. 
 GERALD : It's all right. Keep going. 
 At the other end of the ward, the nurse enters with Future Tommy. Gerald and Harriet quickly move Past Tommy out of the room. 
 GERALD : Don't look back. 
 Just before he leaves, Gerald turns and looks at Future Tommy. Gerald leaves the room. 
 NURSE : You should be in bed. 
 Tommy takes his jacket off. The nurse turns the blanket down. Tommy gets into bed. 
 NURSE : Still warm, at least. Not been gone long. 
 The nurse leaves. Tommy sits in bed looking very scared and confused. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - WORKSTATIONS - DAY 
 Everyone returns to the hub. Gwen puts her kit down as the alarm blares. 
 GWEN : Whoa. What's happening ? 
 Toshiko gets to work on the computers. 
 TOSHIKO : I don't know. 
 JACK : The time-shift hasn't stopped. Toshiko, show me the city, now ! 
 Toshiko puts a satellite view of the city up on the monitor. White lights appear where time shifts occur. As they watch, more and more lights appear. 
 TOSHIKO : It's spreading out from the hospital. 
 Jack nods. 
 GWEN : What the hell are they ? 
 JACK : Chunks of the past erupting into the present. 
 Owen is following on his monitor. 
 OWEN : They're everywhere. 
 GWEN : What about the rift key ? 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy isn't using it. 
 IANTO : Why not ? 
 TOSHIKO : I don't know. Because he's just gone back to ninety years ago, because he's shell-shocked ? 
 JACK : (to Owen) One of us will have to go back. 
 Jack heads for the door as Owen thinks. 
 OWEN : Jack, wait ! (Jack turns around.) You'll get stuck in 1918. I've got an idea. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - AUTOPSY AREA - CONTINUOUS 
 The alarms continue to blare. Owen moves the monitor aside. 
 OWEN : The time-shifts are forcing the rift open. If we're quick, we can use it to our advantage. 
 He turns and opens the refrigerator and takes out Tommy's blood samples. 
 OWEN : (mutters) A tiny amount should do. (He hands the rack to Gwen.) We know Tommy's exact location in time. If we send an image of you through to him... 
 Jack comes down the steps. He gets it. 
 JACK : ...I can go into Tommy's mind. 
 Owen preps the syringe. Everyone is moving quickly. 
 OWEN : As a psychic projection. Yes, if we're lucky. 
 GWEN : And Tommy will be able to see you. 
 JACK : I can make him use the key. 
 Jack sits in the chair, his sleeves rolled up and arm outstretched. Owen looks for a vein. 
 TOSHIKO : Let me do it. 
 Everyone stops and turns to look at Toshiko standing above them, leaning over the railing. 
 TOSHIKO : He trusts me. 
 They look at Jack. Jack looks down at the syringe mere inches from his arm. 
 JACK : (nods) Okay. 
 CUT TO : 
 Toshiko is hooked up to a head monitor and in the chair Jack was just in. 
 TOSHIKO : How long have I got ? 
 OWEN : Minutes. 
 JACK : You've got one shot, Tosh. That's all. 
 Owen looks at Toshiko. 
 OWEN : All right ? 
 She nods. Owen injects her. He hands the syringe to Gwen, then monitor's Toshiko's pulse. Toshiko's eyes close. Jack has his fingers on Toshiko's neck pulse. Everyone looks at each other and waits. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. ST. TEILO'S HOSPITAL - 1918 - DAY 
 Its madness and chaos in the ward. The patients scream as the building shakes and lights flicker. Tommy sits up in bed and looks around. He looks scared. 
 TOSHIKO : (o.s.) Tommy. 
 Pull back to reveal Toshiko sitting on the edge of Tommy's bed. 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy. 
 Tommy continues to look around. 
 INTERCUT WITH : 
 INT. HUB - AUTOPSY AREA 
 Toshiko is back in the hub. Jack has a hand on her shoulder and everyone surrounds her. 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy. 
 GWEN : (whispers) Oh, she's found him. 
 Tommy turns and looks at Toshiko. 
 TOSHIKO : It's me. Toshiko. 
 TOMMY : Who ? 
 TOSHIKO : (echoy) I'm here to help you. 
 Tommy looks down at the rift key he's holding. He offers it to her. 
 TOMMY : Is this yours ? 
 TOSHIKO : No. Do you know what it is ? 
 Tommy can barely focus. He looks at someone else near the bed. She pulls his attention back to her. 
 TOSHIKO : Tommy, it's a key. You have to use it. 
 Tommy looks at her, scared. Back in the hub, everyone is quiet as they wait. Jack glances at his watch. Owen continues to monitor Toshiko's pulse. In the hospital, Tommy looks at Toshiko. 
 TOMMY : I'm scared. 
 TOSHIKO : It's all right. 
 TOMMY : That's why I'm here. I'm a... I'm a coward. 
 TOSHIKO : No, you are not. 
 TOMMY : What am I fighting for ? 
 TOSHIKO : For the future, for me. Because you're my brave, handsome hero. (He looks at her.) Tommy, use the key. 
 Tommy nods. He holds up the rift key and twists the latch on the side. The dial turns, opens and wisps of golden rift light escapes out from the key. He turns the latch back and it closes again. 
 TOSHIKO : Thank you. 
 TOMMY : Goodbye. 
 The building shakes and roars. Extremely bright light engulfs them. 
 INT. HUB - AUTOPSY BAY 
 Toshiko opens her eyes and takes deep heaving gasps of breath. The sudden movement startles everyone. Owen holds onto Toshiko's wrist, no longer taking a pulse. 
 OWEN : It's all right. 
 Jack holds onto Toshiko's shoulder. 
 TOSHIKO : He did it. 
 Owen looks at Jack. There are large tears in Toshiko's eyes. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. HUB - WORKSTATIONS 
 Toshiko sits on the couch and she slowly folds Tommy's clothes - the last se of clothes he wore before going back in time. She pauses a moment, then continues folding. She puts the clothes in the box and covers it. Owen steps out from the autopsy area and watches her for a moment. He leaves as she secures the straps on the lid. Leaving the box there on the coffee table, she stands up and puts her jacket on. Jack appears in his office doorway. 
 JACK : Hey. 
 Toshiko looks at him. 
 JACK : Thank you. 
 Toshiko nods and leaves. 
 EXT. CHURCH COURTYARD OVERLOOKING THE BAY - DAY 
 Toshiko stands out against the railing over looking the bay. The white church is behind her. Owen rushes along the wet sidewalk and joins her at the railing. 
 TOSHIKO : He trusted me. Right to the end... 
 OWEN : Because you were strong. 
 He points in a sweeping motion to the scene in front of them. 
 OWEN : All of this... is still here because of you. 
 TOSHIKO : (shakes her head) Because of Tommy. Let's hope we're worth it. 
 And with that, Toshiko leaves. Owen turns and watches her go. Toshiko walks away and doesn't look back.
