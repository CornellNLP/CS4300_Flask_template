 INT. GWEN’S PLACE – BEDROOM – DAY 
 Gwen giggles and laughs as Rhys holds onto her leg as she tries to get out of bed. He tries to pull her back. 
 RHYS : Come on let’s… ! 
 GWEN: No, I can't, I'm late as it is. 
 He successfully pulls her back into bed and onto her back. She laughs, her shoe clutched in her hand. 
 GWEN : Argh ! Rhys ! 
 RHYS : You’re itching to go back to work, aren't you ? 
 She smiles this way and that at him. 
 RHYS : Oh, I'll take that as a "yes," then. 
 GWEN : Having you to come home to, that's the best bit. (Beat) Aw... 
 He doesn’t buy it. He fakes retching and they laugh.

 INT. THE HUB - WORKSTATIONS – DAY 
 Owen sits at the workstation and looks through a file. He’s dressed in a conservative sweater and is wearing glasses. Jack rushes out of his office carrying a Torchwood locked box. 
 JACK : Unlabeled Class D artefacts. (He puts it down on the table). Tosh, I need you to run a full check. 
 Toshiko is walking past on her way back to her workstation. 
 TOSHIKO : Sure. 
 There’s another man there. 
 JACK : Owen, you can help. 
 OWEN : Happy to. 
 JACK : Adam, I know how much you love audits. 
 Owen vacates the workstation seat. 
 ADAM : Ah, it's gotta be done. 
 JACK : If you could... 
 ADAM : ... go through the reports, find out when they came through the Rift. 
 Adam sits down. 
 JACK : You okay with that ? 
 Gwen arrives at the workstations area. She takes her jacket off. 
 ADAM (smiles) : I have been for the last three years. 
 Adam’s smile fades when he sees Gwen. 
 JACK : You're late. 
 GWEN : Yes, Paris was lovely, thank you ! 
 Gwen and Adam look at each other. Gwen looks at the others. 
 GWEN : Who the hell is this ? 
 Jack’s smile fades. Owen stands in the autopsy archway and looks at Gwen. Toshiko, who is looking very sexy in a green top unbuttoned down to her cleavage, hair up and no glasses, also looks worriedly at Gwen. Adam gets up and walks over to Gwen. 
 ADAM : Just cause that's what I said to you on your first day... 
 He puts his hand on her shoulder. 
 ADAM : ... remember ?

 GWEN : Sorry, couldn't resist. Come here, you ! (She gives him a hug. Everyone smiles and the tense moment is gone). Good to see you. 
 Gwen moves away from Adam and smiles at Toshiko. 
 GWEN : Hey, Tosh, you're looking good. 
 Toshiko smiles. Hold on Adam, whose smile fades into a sneer. 
 INT. THE HUB – WORKSTATIONS 
 CUT TO : MONITOR 
 Adam’s photo appears on the screen. A personnel information sheet is created for him : NAME : ADAM SMITH. Adam is typing out his information into the system. He quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure no one is watching. D.O.B. : 16/11/82. RECRUITED : 07/05/050 – 0000. He enters the information. 
 TOSHIKO (o.s.) : Adam ? (He clears the screen back to various images). What are you doing with your personnel file ? 
 He finishes and turns around. Toshiko is there. 
 ADAM : Nothing, just finished updating details of rift activity. 
 She shows him a box with intricate patterns on the side. 
 TOSHIKO : Any idea when this came through ? It's got a low meson energy reading. 
 He takes the box from her, looks at it, then sets it aside. 
 ADAM : No, I'll keep looking. 
 She looks at him for a moment. Adam touches her neck with familiarity.

 ADAM : A year ago today. 
 TOSHIKO : Our first kiss. 
 ADAM : You remembered. 
 TOSHIKO : Hmm. 
 They continue kissing. Owen arrives at the workstations and sets the tray down loudly. Toshiko and Adam look at Owen. 
 TOSHIKO : You okay, Owen ? 
 OWEN : Uh, yes, yes, yes. Don't worry about me. N... no, it's just, uh... kissing in work... um, I wasn't expecting it. 
 Owen removes his gloves and heads back down to the autopsy area. 
 ADAM : We'll celebrate tonight. 
 Adam kisses Toshiko again. She smiles and walks away. We linger on Adam, his smile fades.

 INT. THE HUB – THE VAULTS – DAY 
 The door opens and Jack walks in. He hits the lights and passes by the cell with the Weevil in it. The weevil gets up, slams its hands against the glass, and growls loudly. Jack turns back and stops in front of the weevil cell. 
 JACK : Save it ! 
 Jack again turns and stops as he passes by the next cell. Inside in a little boy. Jack turns and looks at the boy. 
 INSERT : FLASHBACK 
 A child’s hand slips out of a larger hand. 
 END FLASHBACK 
 Jack is spooked as he looks at the little boy in the cell. 
 GWEN : (o.s.) Jack ? Jack turns and finds Gwen standing in the doorway. When he turns back to look at the cell, the little boy is gone. Was he even there at all ? 
 Jack heads over to Gwen. 
 GWEN : You okay ? 
 JACK : Yeah, fine. 
 He laughs nervously and glances back at the cell behind him. Gwen slaps Jack on his behind. 
 GWEN : Did you miss me ? 
 JACK : Were you gone ? 
 Jack reaches to grab Gwen, she turns and runs out laughing. Jack chases after her. In the doorway, he stops and turns around to look back. The weevil in the cell growls. 
 INT. THE HUB – WORKSTATIONS 
 Toshiko heads toward her workstation. Gwen and Ianto are sitting side-by-side on the couch. Gwen is flipping through the file while Ianto is toying with a device. 
 TOSHIKO : Just doing a quick check. We had rift activity two days ago, but nothing seems to have come through. 
 Adam is sitting at another workstation. A small stuffed rodent peers out from behind Toshiko’s monitor. 
 OWEN : (o.s.) Apart from me ! 
 Gwen smiles. Owen laughs as he squeezes the stuffed toy, making it squeak. He waves it at Toshiko. 
 TOSHIKO : What's that ? 
 OWEN : It's a screen-cleaner. I thought you might like it, um... Do you... do you like it ? 
 TOSHIKO : Just what I need. A small rodent looking at me while I work. (She steps away, pauses, and looks over her shoulder). Think I'll call it Owen. 
 Owen sighs as he clutches the folder to his chest and heads back to the autopsy area. Gwen chuckles. 
 GWEN : He's like a little puppy, bringing her sticks. When's he gonna realize he's got no chance ? 
 IANTO : Love's blind, apparently. He's idolized her for years now. 
 ADAM : Oh, leave him alone. I think it's sweet. He's happy. 
 CUT TO : 
 EXT. CARDIFF CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT 
 Lovely city night lights. 
 INT. GWEN’S PLACE – NIGHT 
 Gwen returns home, steps into the living room and finds the lights on. She’s puzzled by this. She takes her bag off just as Rhys steps into the room, his robe on and wiping his hair with a towel. Gwen puts her bag down. Rhys sees her, smiles and walks up to her from behind. He reaches for her to turn her around. 
 RHYS : E-e-ey ! 
 Gwen screams. Thinking she’s just startled, Rhys laughs. 
 GWEN : Stop it ! 
 Gwen steps away from him and into the kitchen. 
 RHYS : Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. 
 GWEN : How did you get in ? 
 RHYS : With a key ! 
 Gwen picks up the large knife out of the rack. She holds it on Rhys. 
 RHYS : What ? (Serious). This isn't funny. 
 GWEN (eyes wide and scared) : Stay back, all right ? Stay back ! 
 RHYS : Gwen, what's going on ? 
 GWEN : How do you know my name ? Huh ? 
 Gwen takes her gun out and cocks it. She points it at Rhys. 
 GWEN : I know how to use this. Now, who are you ? And what do you want ? 
 RHYS : You know who I am... 
 GWEN : Fine, if you won't tell me, fine. You stay there. 
 She takes her phone out of her bag and dials with one hand while holding the gun on Rhys. 
 GWEN : Don't you move. (To phone) : Jack... yeah, someone's broken into my flat. He had a key. He knows my name. 
 RHYS : It’s because I live here with you ! 
 GWEN (to Rhys) : Shut it ! Shut it ! (To phone) Yeah. Can you hurry, Jack ? He's a nutter. (Hangs up and drops the phone). You have picked the wrong girl to stalk, mate. 
 Rhys looks at Gwen.

 Rhys moves out of the way, his hands up in the air. Gwen hurries toward the door. He tries again. 
 RHYS : Gwen ? 
 GWEN : Stay there !

 Jack and Adam enter the room. Jack finds Gwen with her gun on Rhys. Jack and Adam keep their guns on Rhys, but clearly Jack is just as puzzled. 
 JACK : What's going on ? 
 GWEN : You tell me. Look ! 
 She picks up a framed photo and shows it to them. 
 GWEN : He's put photos of us up. (Rhys rolls his eyes). He must have done it while I was at work. He's deluded ! He keeps saying he's my boyfriend. 
 JACK : He is. It's Rhys. 
 Rhys turns and looks at Gwen. 
 GWEN : I've never seen him before in my life ! 
 Jack steps next to Rhys. 
 JACK : You've been with him for years. 
 RHYS : See ! 
 Jack holds out his hand. 
 JACK : Give me the gun, Gwen. 
 GWEN : No ! He... he grabbed me, Jack. Who knows what he was going to do ? 
 RHYS : How can you say that ?! (To Jack) What have you done to her ? 
 JACK : Nothing. 
 RHYS : Oh, come on ! I know what kind of sick games you play. Pills that make you forget, is that what this is, yeah ? Are you phasing me out so you can have her all to yourself ? 
 JACK : Hey ! 
 Rhys grabs Jack. Jack grabs Rhys. Gwen steps forward with her gun still on Rhys. 
 GWEN : Stay away from him ! 
 Jack puts a hand on Gwen’s gun to stop her from pointing it at Rhys. 
 JACK : Hey ! 
 RHYS (upset) : We're engaged ! I bought you the bloody ring you're wearing ! 
 Gwen looks at Jack. Jack nods for her to look. Gwen lifts her hand up and sees the ring. She really looks shocked. She goes back to holding the gun. Adam steps forward. 
 ADAM : Why don't you come with me to the Hub. 
 RHYS (to Adam) : Who the hell are you ? 
 JACK : He's one of us. 
 ADAM : We can check you. Jack will stay and take care of things. 
 JACK (softly to Gwen) : Okay. 
 Gwen puts her gun down. Adam leads Gwen toward the door. 
 GWEN : Don't let him go. If he comes after me again, I'll kill him. 
 Gwen and Adam leave. Jack looks at Rhys. 
 JACK : Trust me, I didn't do this. But whatever's happened... we'll put it right. 
 Rhys nods. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. THE HUB – AUTOPSY AREA – NIGHT 
 Owen uses a penlight and checks Gwen’s eyes as Adam watches. 
 OWEN : Right, well, no signs of long-term damage, as far as I can see. Or alien intervention. But, I must be missing something. I'm sorry, but it's a mystery to me why you can't remember Rhys. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. GWEN’S PLACE – NIGHT 
 Jack sets a digital video recorder down on the coffee table and faces it toward Rhys. 
 RHYS : Is this really necessary ? 
 JACK : She needs to remember. 
 Rhys sighs. 
 JACK : Where did you meet ? 
 RHYS : Er, college. Fancied her from the moment I saw her. Uh, not-not just her looks, you know, I mean, I mean she is a looker, I... oh, I... 
 Rhys puts his head in his hands runs them back through his hair. 
 INTERCUT WITH : 
 INT. THE HUB - WORKSTATIONS – NIGHT 
 Gwen is watching the video on the monitors. On the monitor, Rhys groans. 
 JACK (o.s., from monitor) : Tell me about your first kiss. 
 RHYS (from monitor) : Um, in the supermarket. I was going to make a spag bol... and then I realized that it’s got bloody garlic. Can't kiss a girl with garlic breath. 
 Rhys chuckles. Adam kneels next to Gwen. 
 RHYS (from monitor) : So, um... we were in the queue and... uh... 
 ADAM : Do you remember that ? 
 GWEN : Sort of. It's like I'm... 
 RHYS (from monitor) : I said, I wanted to do something else. Something without garlic. 
 GWEN : I'm seeing what he's saying, but... 
 RHYS (b.g., from monitor) : So she gets pissed off. 
 GWEN : I don't remember how I... felt. 
 RHYS (b.g., from monitor) : Because the queues are so long. 
 Adam cups Gwen’s cheek with the palm of his hand. 
 ADAM : Believe me when I tell you that that is your fiancé. 
 RHYS (b.g., from monitor) : ... and I kick off... 
 ADAM : Your memory's just playing tricks on you, that's all. Okay. 
 RHYS (from monitor) : ...and I end up shouting out why I'm changing the recipe. 
 GWEN (to Adam) : Okay. 
 INT. GWEN’S PLACE – NIGHT 
 RHYS : She starts to laugh.

 Owen takes the artefact box out of a scanning device. Toshiko walks in. 
 TOSHIKO : Worked out what that thing is yet ? 
 OWEN : No joy yet. (He puts the box on the table). But you should have a look at the detail, Tosh. It's gorgeous. 
 She walks over to him and picks up the box. He immediately grabs the box to help her. He looks at her. 
 OWEN : Oh, let me get that. 
 TOSHIKO : Have you managed to open it yet ? 
 OWEN : Uh, no, sorry. I'm not doing very well, am I ? 
 She goes over to the laptop. 
 TOSHIKO : It's gonna be a long night. 
 OWEN : Yes, which is why I brought... 
 He puts the box down and picks up a red and a blue container. 
 OWEN : ... some sandwiches ! (He slides the red container across the table toward her). One for you... and one for me. Smoked salmon, that is your favorite, isn't it ? 
 TOSHIKO : How d'you know that ? 
 She looks at him. Owen can’t meet her gaze. 
 TOSHIKO : I'm gonna need a beer. 
 She heads toward the door. The door opens. 
 OWEN : What ? While we're working ?! 
 She turns and looks back over her shoulder at him. 
 OWEN : Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, right. Um, relax, kick back, it's a good idea. 
 The door closes behind her. 
 OWEN (calls out) : Er, not for me though, thanks ! 
 The door closes shut, leaving Owen alone in the room. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. GWEN’S PLACE – NIGHT

 GWEN (desperately) : Don't leave me, Jack. 
 He looks at her. 
 JACK : You'll be okay. 
 Jack sets her away from him and heads for the door. He heads out. Ianto gives Gwen a thumb’s up before following Jack out and leaving Gwen alone with Rhys. She turns and looks at Rhys, this stranger who is her fiancé. 
 CUT TO : 
 EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GWEN’S BUILDING – NIGHT 
 Jack and Ianto head back to their SUV. 
 JACK : What was that all about ? 
 IANTO : Temporary amnesia. Owen's checking possible causes. Oh... 
 Ianto tosses the car keys to Jack. Jack catches it, turns and unlocks the SUV. The alarm chirps. He turns and sees a young boy standing on the other side of the street. The sight of the boy freezes him. He looks as if he’s seen a ghost. 
 IANTO : Weevil sighting by the sewer in Rockall Street. 
 There’s no response. 
 IANTO : Jack... 
 Jack doesn’t answer him. He continues to stare at the boy standing across the street. 
 IANTO : Jack ! 
 Jack turns to Ianto. 
 JACK : Can you see him ? 
 IANTO : Who ? 
 There’s a whoosh. Jack turns around and the boy is gone ! Jack is freaking out. 
 JACK : I'll drop you off and check out the sighting. 
 Jack opens the car door and gets inside the car. Ianto gets into the passenger side and closes the door. 
 IANTO : I could come with you. It's been a while since we went hunting together. 
 JACK : I'll be fine on my own. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. THE HUB – CONFERENCE ROOM – NIGHT 
 Owen is sitting in a chair at the conference table and going through a file. The door opens and closes. He looks up as Toshiko walks in carrying two beers. Her top buttons are undone, showing a daring amount of cleavage. She puts one of the beer bottles on the table in front of Owen and offers him the bottle opener. 
 TOSHIKO : Go on. Live a little. 
 OWEN : Well, as it's you. (He takes the bottle opener. Toshiko sits on the table and crosses her legs). Thank you. 
 TOSHIKO : Call it a celebration. 
 OWEN : Oh, yes ? 
 He opens his bottle and clinks his bottle to hers. 
 TOSHIKO : Adam and I have been together for one year today. 
 OWEN : Right, right. 
 TOSHIKO : A whole year. My stomach still flips when he touches me. I've never known anything like it. The two of us, we just fit. D'you know what I mean ? 
 OWEN : Um, not sure I do, no. 
 She puts her beer bottle down and pats his hand. 
 TOSHIKO : Don't worry. You'll meet the right girl one day. 
 OWEN : Yeah. Tosh... 
 She turns and looks over her shoulder at him with a half-smile on her face. 
 OWEN : Um... um... D'you really think I look like a rodent ? 
 TOSHIKO : Come on, we're going to crack this box even if it kills us. 
 INT. UNDERGROUND SEWERS – NIGHT 
 Jack jumps down the ladder and looks around the sewers with his flashlight. 
 JACK : Come out, come out, wherever you are. 
 He starts down one way, then stops and turns around when he hears a faint growling. 
 JACK : Giving me the runaround, huh ? You picked the wrong day, my friend. 
 Jack starts down the corridor, then stops abruptly at the sight of a familiar face. 
 FRANKLIN (VISION) : Get out ! Get out, son. 
 JACK : Dad ? 
 FRANKLIN (VISION) (shouts) : Run ! 
 Jack turns and runs. 
 EXT. - NIGHT – CONTINUOUS

 Jack whirls around and finds Adam standing there. 
 ADAM : Was it down there ? The weevil ? 
 JACK : No. How did you get here ? 
 ADAM : Well, I came with you, Jack, remember ? 
 Adam puts a hand on Jack’s shoulder. 
 JACK : Yeah, of course. 
 ADAM : Are you okay ? Jack, what did you see ? 
 JACK : My past. 
 INT. GWEN’S PLACE – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT 
 Gwen and Rhys sit uncomfortably on the couch, an awkward silence around them. Gwen puts the framed photo of them down on the coffee table. She still can’t remember. 
 GWEN : If what you say is true... 
 RHYS : It is. We love each other. 
 He reaches to put a hand on Gwen’s arm and she pulls away from him. 
 GWEN : But how could I forget that ? 
 Rhys shakes his head and stands up. He heads for the kitchen and checks the refrigerator. He shuts the refrigerator door. 
 RHYS (sighs) : Nothing in. I was going to take you out for a meal. (He pours himself a drink). Didn't want the weekend to finish, I suppose. 
 Gwen doesn’t say anything. She eyes the many framed photos on the counter of the two of them together and happy. 
 EXT. BASKETBALL COURTS / PARK – NIGHT 
 It’s raining. Jack is walking away. Adam follows. 
 ADAM : Jack, please. Talk to me. What about the past ? Is it your childhood ? 
 Jack stops and whirls around. Adam walks up to him. He puts a hand on Jack’s shoulder. 
 ADAM : I've always been here for you, Jack. From the very beginning. I'm the one you can confide in, remember ? 
 JACK : It was meant to be buried. I buried the memory over 150 years ago. Why now ? 
 Jack turns and walks away again. 
 ADAM : Well, maybe it's time. Maybe up until now, your subconscious was protecting you. But you can't block out the past forever. 
 JACK : I can't afford to remember. 
 Jack steps out onto a court. Adam follows him. 
 ADAM : Jack, talk to me, please. 
 JACK : Why ? 
 ADAM : I can help. Trust me. 
 JACK : I'm not sure I should do this. 
 ADAM : Just tell me what you see. I can help you. That's why I'm here.

 CUT TO : 
 INT. THE HUB – CONFERENCE ROOM – NIGHT 
 Toshiko reads the test results as Owen examines the box. Ianto leans against the doorframe watching them. The various clocks on the walls in the conference room read various times throughout the scene, 10:35, 11:47 and 2:30. Go figure. 
 TOSHIKO : So, according to the molecular breakdown, this potentially alien complex artefact is, in fact, made out of wood. 
 OWEN : Well, perhaps it fell in the crate by mistake. Picked up meson energy from the other stuff. 
 TOSHIKO (scoffs) : Yeah, right ! 
 OWEN (mumbles) : Oh, yes, sorry, it's a stupid idea. 
 IANTO : I think Jack brought it in. 
 TOSHIKO : No, I'm sure Adam found it on an excavation a few months back. 
 IANTO : I'll have a look in the diary. I like to log the interesting stuff. 
 TOSHIKO (amused) : You write about artefacts in your diary ? 
 IANTO : Among other things. 
 Ianto winks at her, turns and leaves. 
 OWEN : So, we are done for the night. 
 TOSHIKO : I guess. 
 OWEN : Everything all right ? 
 TOSHIKO : Yeah, just, Adam hasn't rung yet. 
 Toshiko walks over and picks up the box. She heads back to her laptop. 
 OWEN : Ah. Sure he will. I know I would, if it was our anniversary. I wouldn't disappear. In fact, I would... uh... cherish you. 
 TOSHIKO : Ah, Owen ! 
 OWEN : Yeah, no, no... um... really, really, I would. In fact, I wouldn't let you out of my sight, Tosh... because I love you. 
 TOSHIKO (surprised) : What ? 
 OWEN : Yeah, there we are. I've said it. I... I love you. Yes, I always have, actually, ever since we started working together, and in fact, I actually ache for you, you know, physically. When you're in the room, I when you’re in the room I just want to reach out and touch you and... 
 TOSHIKO (uncomfortable) : Owen ! 
 OWEN : No, no, no, you know, I can't keep this secret any more ! My mum said to me, "Seize the day," and so I am seizing it, and you know I've got so much love to give you, Tosh, and, and you know, you won't know that unless I tell you. So here I am, telling you that I love you. You know I know there's Adam, okay, but you know, I think... In fact, I know that we would be amazing together, um... if you would only just give it a chance. (Toshiko looks away and is silent). Oh, God. Say something. 
 TOSHIKO (bursts) : That is completely inappropriate. 
 OWEN : Pardon ? 
 TOSHIKO : What are you thinking of ? 
 OWEN : I'm sorry, I just wanted you to know. 
 TOSHIKO : How dare you! I'm with Adam. (Heads for the door) And even if I wasn't... you're not my type. Never will be. 
 She leaves. The door shuts behind her. 
 OWEN : Oh.

 INT. SUPERMARKET – NIGHT 
 Rhys and Gwen are out marketing. Rhys grabs a package out of the refrigerator unit and drops it in his basket. Gwen stands on the side and watches. 
 GWEN : Maybe I should be on my own tonight. 
 RHYS : No way. What if you forget who you are ? 
 GWEN : I know who I am. 
 He walks past her. 
 RHYS : It's not just you who's lost something. 
 He puts his basket on the cash register counter. 
 GWEN : But you remember. 
 RHYS : All you know about me. 
 The cashier’s phone rings and he answers it. 
 RHYS : You're my girl, my best friend. 
 CASHIER (to phone) : Hey, you all right ? What's happening ? 
 Laughs. 
 RHYS : Suddenly, all that's gone. 
 The cashier walks away. 
 CASHIER (to phone) : A stormer of a night ! What about her, mate ? 
 Rhys watches him walk away, getting more and more pissed. 
 RHYS : Where's he going now ? He just walked off ! He knows I'm waiting. (Loudly). Oh, fine. I'll help myself, then ! 
 He pulls out some money and puts it on the counter. 
 RHYS (rants) : Here you are ! Keep the change ! (Gwen starts to giggle). Buy some spot cream ! I'm not coming here again. It's overpriced. There's a £1.50 charge on the cash machine. It's a bloody disgrace. 
 Gwen starts laughing. 
 RHYS : Honestly, kids these days. Don't know the meaning of hard wo... 
 He turns and stops when he sees Gwen laughing. 
 RHYS : What ? 
 GWEN : Rhys... Rhys the Rant. (Her smile fades, the words coming from nowhere). Always when you're in a queue, or driving, or when you're on the phone to one of those, um (she motions pushing a button), automated phone thingies... 
 She nods and starts crying. He takes her hand. 
 RHYS (gently) : Hey, it's okay. It's okay. 
 Gwen holds onto Rhys’ hand as he picks up his bags. 
 RHYS : Come on, sweetheart. 
 They leave.

 INT. THE HUB – LOUNGE AREA – NIGHT 
 It’s dark and quiet. Ianto sits alone on the couch reading through his diary. He flips through the pages, scanning the pages quickly and looking for something. Finally, he closes the book and looks a little freaked. He sits forward and puts the book down on the coffee table. He leans back on the couch. Reveal : Adam sitting on the other end of the couch watching him. 
 ADAM : What's wrong ? 
 Startled, Ianto jumps off the couch and moves away from him. Adam reaches for the diary left on the coffee table. 
 IANTO : My diary. 
 Adam picks up the diary and holds it up. 
 IANTO : You're not in it. 
 Adam opens the diary and looks through it. 
 IANTO : Everyone else is. 
 Adam is on his feet and approaches Ianto. He’s still looking through the diary. He looks at Ianto. 
 IANTO : Why would I leave you out when you've been here so long ? 
 Adam closes the diary. 
 IANTO : Like I'm remembering a man who doesn't exist. 
 Adam’s face scrunches up in anger. He deliberately drops the diary. The hand holding the diary flickers. Adam grabs his arm to steady it. Ianto watches. Adam’s arm solidifies. Ianto looks at Adam. 
 IANTO : What are you ? 
 Adam grabs Ianto and slams him up against the wall. 
 ADAM : Cross me, and I will fill you full of fake memories until your head is on fire, because that's how I exist. 
 Ianto pushes Adam away from him. 
 IANTO : Gwen ? What did you do to her ? 
 Adam advances toward Ianto, who backs away from him. 
 ADAM : Memory is a very delicate thing. Feeding myself in wiped other memories out. It's a side-effect of what I have to do in order to survive. 
 IANTO : Jack has to know. 
 Adam slams Ianto up against the wall and places his palm flat against Ianto’s forehead. Ianto gasps and chokes. 
 ADAM : Remember this.

 It’s night. Ianto is choking a woman. He throws her onto a mattress on the ground against a wall in an alley.

 as Ianto approaches her. 
 WOMAN : Please don't hurt me ! 
 ADAM (v.o.) : Good old Ianto, loyal Ianto.

 BACK TO SCENE 
 Adam kisses Ianto. He holds Ianto up against his chest. 
 ADAM : You know, I forgot what a rush it is, feeding in the bad stuff. 
 Ianto cowers and clings to Adam. Adam is through with Ianto. He pats him on the forehead and walks away. Ianto turns this way and that way. 
 INSERT : CUTS OF BAD MEMORY 
 Ianto is back in the rainy alley. He’s on the ground. Where is he exactly, he doesn’t know. He’s back in the hub. Ianto is sitting in the rainy alley.

 A woman runs out of the building toward Young Jack, who is kneeling next to Franklin’s dead body. She kneels next to her husband’s body.

 He doesn’t stir. She bows her head and cries. 
 YOUNG JACK (reaches out) : Mom ? 
 She turns and hugs Young Jack. 
 JACK’S MOM : Where's Gray ? 
 Young Jack’s face falls. He doesn’t know and probably just realizes that Gray’s not there. 
 JACK’S MOM : Where's Gray ? Where is he, son ? (Firmly). Where is he ?

 VARIOUS FLASHES OF : 
 Youngs Jack and Gray are holding hands and running along with the other people.

 Rhys is sitting on the edge of the bed. Gwen steps into the room wearing a pink bathrobe over her pajamas. She removes her robe, drops it on the floor and slips into bed. 
 RHYS : Anything ? 
 GWEN : It's still a bit of a blur, but I'm getting there. 
 RHYS : That's all we've got, really. Memories. That's what brought us to here... to this point. 
 GWEN : We found it before, we'll find it again. 
 RHYS : You know, I, um... (clears throat) ... I always worried that you'd... that you'd just settled for me, you know. ‘Cause if you met me now, Gwen, with all that goes on in your life, could be that you wouldn't look twice at me. 
 GWEN: Don't say that. 
 He kisses her. 
 RHYS : Do you remember that ? 
 GWEN : No. It felt like the first time. But it was nice. 
 Rhys smiles. He leans forward and kisses her neck. Gwen pulls away. 
 GWEN : I like that. 
 RHYS : I know. 
 GWEN : Remind me some more. 
 She nods toward the bed. They share a smile and lie down out of camera frame. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. TOSHIKO’S APARTMENT – BEDROOM – NIGHT 
 Adam and Toshiko are kissing and undressing each other. Toshiko pulls Adam’s shirt up and over his head. They’re panting and kissing heavily. She pushes him backward onto the bed. 
 WIDE SHOT of the room shows her shoes discarded on the floor near a nearly empty bottle of wine and two partiallyfilled glasses. Toshiko crawls over Adam and kisses his chest and up to his mouth. He rolls them over as they continue to kiss. He pulls back and looks at her. She touches his lips. 
 TOSHIKO : What's wrong ? 
 ADAM : How far would you go for me ? 
 She reaches for his jeans. He grabs her hand and stops her.

 Jack starts back down the stairs, making his way toward Ianto, who is sitting with his back to the spiral stairs in the coffee area. 
 JACK : Hey. (As he gets closer, he sees that Ianto isn’t looking good). What's wrong ? 
 IANTO : You'll have to put me in the vaults. Lock me up. I killed three girls. (Sniffles). Strangled them. 
 JACK (doesn’t believe it) : Stop kidding around. 
 IANTO : I'm serious. I murdered them, in cold blood. I took their bodies, and... 
 Ianto surges noisily to his feet. He looks around, obviously still trapped in his bad memories. Jack watches him carefully. 
 IANTO : You have to lock me away... before I turn on you. None of you are safe. 
 Ianto starts past Jack. Jack grabs Ianto’s arm to stop him. 
 JACK : Hey, hey. (He grabs and turns Ianto around to look at him). Come here, come here. What's happened to you ? 
 Jack holds Ianto. 
 IANTO (whispers) : I'm a monster. 
 And he truly believes it, too.

 INT. THE HUB – JACK’S OFFICE – NIGHT 
 Jack is sitting at his desk and setting up a machine with a green light pointed toward Ianto, who is sitting on the other side of the desk with his sleeves rolled up and arms on the arm rest. The machine beeps.

 The green light on the machine turns on and off. 
 IANTO : My... hands on her throat. 
 INSERT : VARIOUS FLASHES OF DISTORTED FAKE MEMORY

 It’s a rainy night. The woman runs up against the warehouse door. 
 IANTO : She tried to get away... 
 Distorted : Ianto chokes the woman. 
 IANTO : ... but I was too quick. Pleading... and I... I didn't care. Something in me wants to kill. 
 Jack looks at Ianto over the green light. 
 JACK : No. This is not you. 
 He grabs the light off the machine and it goes out. He gets to his feet and walks around the desk. 
 JACK : Something's changed you. You're not a murderer. 
 He passes Ianto and puts a hand on his shoulder. 
 JACK : I'm certain of it. 
 INT. HUB – WORKSTATIONS – CONTINUOUS 
 Jack is at one of the workstations. He’s typing on the keyboard, going through the CCTV security video from inside the hub. He finds something, a video of Ianto cowering on the floor. 
 ADAM (from video) : All human record is a lie. (On the video, Ianto tries to get away). You crave flesh. Remember this. 
 Jack can’t believe what he’s seeing. From the video, Ianto screams. Jack goes back further on the CCTV video. He finds a clip of Adam with Toshiko.

 INT. THE HUB – AUTOPSY AREA – NIGHT – CONTINUOUS 
 Jack opens the refrigerator door, looking for the team’s blood samples. He pulls out the entire tray. He checks each vial. Jack looks at Ianto, who is sitting on the floor nearby. 
 JACK : Where's Adam's blood sample ? 
 Ianto gets up and goes to the workstation. He pulls up Adam’s personnel information. 
 IANTO : Everything's in order here. 
 JACK : When was it last updated ? 
 IANTO : Um... (He checks). Twenty-four hours ago. 
 The overhead lights switch on. Ianto quickly changes the monitor screen and gets up out of the chair. Jack turns away and picks up a book. He casually opens and looks at it. Owen stumbles in carrying a large bouquet of flowers. They stop and stare at each other for a beat. Suddenly, sounds of the cog door opening are heard. Owen puts the flowers down on Toshiko’s workstation. Ianto moves quickly past him and disappears up the spiral stairs in the back. Owen looks at Jack and removes his jacket as he heads toward the autopsy area. Jack is left holding the book. 
 TOSHIKO (o.s., giggles) : Stop it! 
 ADAM (o.s.) : You like it. 
 Off screen we hear Toshiko’s soft giggles. Jack turns and heads back to his office. Toshiko stops and sees the flowers on her workstation. 
 TOSHIKO : Oh... 
 Adam steps away. Toshiko smells the flowers and looks for a card. Owen steps up out of the autopsy area and heads toward Toshiko. 
 TOSHIKO : Owen... 
 OWEN : About last night... um... it was selfish of me. 
 Adam sits in the nearby chair and watches Toshiko and Owen. Jack stands in his office and watches Adam. 
 TOSHIKO : Owen, I think the world of you... 
 OWEN : I know. I'm really sorry. I don't want to jeopardize our friendship. The most important thing is that you're happy. 
 TOSHIKO : Thank you. 
 He takes a couple of steps to leave, then stops and turns back to Toshiko. 
 OWEN : Tosh... you are... (He turns and indicates Adam) ... you are happy with Adam, aren't you ? 
 TOSHIKO : Completely. 
 OWEN (nods) : Okay. 
 Owen leaves. Adam watches him go and smirks. He looks up and sees Ianto up on the far back catwalk. Gwen walks in. 
 GWEN : Hey. 
 TOSHIKO : Hey, how are you today ? 
 GWEN : Um, things are coming back slowly. (Adam gets up and heads toward them). Rhys 
 thought I shouldn't come into work, but... 
 ADAM (interrupts) : Hey, we'll look after you. You just have to give yourself time. (Motions). Come on, group hug. 
 Jack watches them from his office and doesn’t move. Adam, Toshiko, Gwen and Owen share a group hug. Ianto makes his way down the spiral stairs. 
 ADAM : Battersea, Remember that Greek place up to 3 am ? 
 GWEN (giggles) : All those plates smashing. 
 OWEN : (indistinct) 
 GWEN : You try it after seven (indistinct) 
 Ianto rolls his eyes and walks past them. 
 ADAM : Hey Ianto, come here. 
 Ianto stops. Adam breaks away from the group and follows Ianto. He takes his jacket off. Ianto turns around and looks at Adam. 
 ADAM : You all right, mate ? 
 Adam reaches for Ianto, who pulls out of his reach. 
 ADAM (sneers) : Listen, I could murder a coffee. 
 Adam heads for the workstation. Ianto takes a breath and looks away. Adam sits down at the workstation. He turns the monitor on and sits back in his chair. Just behind him, Jack cocks his gun pointed at Adam’s head. Gwen and Owen turn around. Toshiko stops and watches. Everyone is stunned. 
 JACK : Talk to me, Adam. If that's even your name. 
 Adam swivels around and laughs. 
 ADAM : What ? 
 GWEN (chuckles nervously) : What are you doing, Jack ? 
 JACK : He's not who you think he is. He's been feeding himself into our memories, by touch. 
 TOSHIKO : Is this some kind of sick joke ? 
 JACK : He didn't exist until two days ago. 
 ADAM : Can somebody tell me what's going on, please ? 
 OWEN : Jack, we've known him for years. He is part of the team. 
 JACK : No. He just made you think that. 
 ADAM : Come on, Jack. 
 Adam reaches for Jack. 
 JACK : Ah-ah-ah ! You don't get to me like that. 
 Adam pulls back. 
 ADAM : Jack, you know me. You recruited me three years ago. 
 JACK : All I know is that when I think of my team, I see you there, but I don't feel anything for you. No pride, no warmth... You, the one who I can confide in, the one who unburied the dead. 
 GWEN : Jack, maybe you've just forgotten him. Like I did with Rhys, yeah ? 
 JACK : Oh I should have spotted it then. That wasn't stress. That was him. By making us think we know him, he disturbs our real memories. 
 ADAM : I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 JACK : I'm taking him to the vaults ! 
 Jack grabs Adam by his shirt front and yanks him out of the chair. 
 ADAM : Jack, this is ridiculous. 
 Jack pushes Adam in front of him and they head down the stairs toward the vaults. 
 JACK : Move ! 
 A gun cocks. 
 TOSHIKO : No ! 
 Toshiko has her gun on Jack. Owen and Gwen both take a step toward Toshiko. 
 GWEN : Tosh ! 
 OWEN : Tosh ! 
 Toshiko swings around and points her gun at them and Ianto. 
 OWEN : That's not gonna help. 
 GWEN: It's fine. 
 JACK (o.s.) : Toshiko ? 
 Toshiko swings around and points the gun at Jack again. 
 JACK (quietly) : I'm just going to lock him up. 
 Ianto is behind Toshiko, slowly inching his way closer to her. Adam looks at Toshiko. 
 TOSHIKO : Let him go. 
 JACK : I'm not going to harm him. 
 TOSHIKO : Why should I believe you ? 
 OWEN : Tosh, Tosh, we can talk about this. 
 She looks at Owen, then swings back to Jack. 
 TOSHIKO : Drop the gun, Jack ! 
 Ianto grabs the gun from Toshiko and wrestles it out of her grip. 
 GWEN : sh1t ! 
 Ianto keeps a firm grip on Toshiko’s wrists as she fights him. 
 TOSHIKO (screams) : Don’t ! Get off me ! Adam ! 
 JACK (to Adam) : This is what you've done to us. Move ! 
 Toshiko pushes Owen and Ianto away from her. 
 TOSHIKO (cries) : Get off ! (Screams). Adam !

 Adam is locked up in one of the cells. He slams his hands against the glass and pants loudly. Jack is standing outside. Again, Adam slams his hands up against the glass. 
 ADAM : Don't kill me. I had to become part of your memories in order to survive. I didn't mean any harm. 
 JACK : You've changed us. 
 ADAM : For the better. You didn't remember who you were. I helped you. Look at Owen, all his cynicism gone. He's a different man now. Selfless, happier. And Toshiko, too; she's never been this confident. 
 JACK : How did you come here ? Why us ? 
 ADAM : All of you have such unique memories, especially you, Jack. All those extraordinary memories you hold, some hidden, some absent. Your singular mind. That's what drew me here. 
 Jack puts his hand on the glass just over Adam’s hand. 
 JACK : Good job. It's what we do best... wipe out aliens. 
 ADAM : You can't shoot me. (Jack turns and walks away). You made me live. And you always remember what you killed... 
 Jack stops. 
 ADAM (sneers) : Don't you, Jack ? 
 Jack leaves. Adam leans his forehead against the glass.

 INT. THE HUB – CONFERENCE ROOM 
 Jack stands at the head of the conference table in front of the monitor with the CCTV showing Adam in his cell. 
 JACK : Our memories define us. Adam changed those memories... changed who we are. Now I have to help you all go back, find a memory that defines you. Rediscover who you are. If I'm wrong, he'll still be here when we've done this. 
 Jack presses the control button and turns the CCTV camera off. He puts on a swirly video pattern. 
 JACK (softly) : Let me take you back to before we all met... 
 Jack presses the control button and dims the lights in the room. 
 JACK (softly) : Feel around for anything that makes you what you are... the hidden and the forgotten. Tell me where you are. 
 Everyone is quiet, unmoving and staring out in front of them. Voiceover thoughts intercut with actual speaking out loud. 
 GWEN (v.o.) : The college canteen... Rhys is sitting opposite me, telling stupid jokes. 
 RHYS (v.o.) : Where do you find a tortoise with no legs ? Where you left it. 
 Gwen’s mouth twitches in a smile. Jack watches her. In her mind, we hear Rhys laugh. Gwen laughs out loud. 
 OWEN (v.o.) : It's my birthday. I'm ten. 
 Jack turns and looks at Owen. 
 OWEN (v.o.) : Mum spends the whole day screaming, (says out loud) "I love you because you're my son... (v.o.)... but that doesn't mean I have to like you." 
 TOSHIKO (v.o.) : Maths club. (out loud) Something so reliable about maths... (v.o.). Always the right answer. 
 Ianto smiles. 
 IANTO (v.o.) : Meeting Lisa. (out loud) Falling in love... (v.o.)... never felt so alive. 
 OWEN (v.o.) : I turn 16. She packs my bags. (out loud) That is the nicest thing you've done for me in years, Mother. 
 GWEN (v.o.) : Kissing him in the supermarket. (out loud) The look on his face. 
 TOSHIKO (v.o.) : My first flat. (out loud) I don't have a flat-warming. (v.o.) There's no one I want to invite. 
 IANTO (v.o.) : Losing Lisa. (out loud) Like the world had ended. 
 Jack is looking at Ianto. 
 GWEN (v.o.) : The way he looks at me sometimes... as if he's scared of what he feels for me, I... (out loud) ... I love him. 
 Jack straightens. He’s not looking at her. Gwen turns and looks straight at Jack. 
 GWEN : But not in the way I love you. 
 Jack holds out his hand. 
 JACK : Take this. 
 Gwen picks up the small white pill and looks at it. 
 TOSHIKO (v.o.) : Knowing there has to be more to life than this. 
 Jack gently touches Gwen’s cheek and moves on. Toshiko’s face is wet with tears. 
 TOSHIKO (v.o.) : Knowing I'm special... (out loud) ... waiting for someone to see it. 
 Jack puts a hand on her shoulder. She turns and looks up at him. 
 JACK (hoarsely) : I saw it. 
 He puts the small white pill on the table in front of her and moves on. Toshiko looks down at the table. 
 OWEN (v.o.) : You save one life, a hundred lives but it's, it’s never enough. (out loud). Who'll save me ? 
 Jack holds Owen’s shoulder. Owen looks at him. 
 JACK : I will. 
 Jack puts the small white pill on the table. He moves on. 
 IANTO (v.o.) : Coming here... (out loud) ... gave me meaning again. (Ianto looks at Jack). You. 
 Jack tenderly kisses Ianto’s forehead. He puts the white pill on the table in front of Ianto. He goes back to the head of the table. 
 JACK : You each have a short-tern amnesia pill. It'll make you forget Adam. We have to wipe out the last 48 hours from our memories, go back to who we were. 
 Ianto picks up the pill and swallows it with some water.

 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – CONTINUOUS 
 Adam slams his head and hands against the glass. He blurs and pants heavily. 
 INT. THE HUB – CONFERENCE ROOM 
 Toshiko turns and looks at Owen. He looks back at her. Owen takes the pill and removes his geeky glasses, putting them on the table. Toshiko hesitates. She reaches for the control panel and presses the button, putting the camera in the vaults back on the monitor. Adam appears on the screen. 
 TOSHIKO : I'm going to lose so much. 
 JACK : None of it was real. 
 TOSHIKO : He loved me... and I loved him. It's no different from real memory. 
 He touches her face. 
 JACK : He forced it on you. You have to let it go. 
 She turns and looks at the monitor. Jack puts the pill in her hand and she sits down. She takes the pill and looks at the monitor. 
 TOSHIKO : Goodbye, Adam. 
 Toshiko puts her head on the table and closes her eyes. Gwen starts to fall asleep and Jack reaches for her, gently putting her head down on the table. Everyone is sleeping at the table. Jack walks out of the room. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – CONTINUOUS 
 Adam is in his cell, sitting on the concrete seat. Jack walks up to the glass. Adam lifts his head and looks at him. 
 JACK : Just me left. 
 ADAM : Jack, I know what it's like not to exist. Please don't send me back there. 
 JACK : I have to. 
 ADAM : What are you gonna do ? 
 Jack shows him the small white pill. 
 JACK : This will wipe out the past two days. 
 ADAM : Well, you'll still keep the bad memories. Because they were always yours. But what about the good times, Jack ? What about the last good memory of you and your dad ? 
 JACK : It's lost. 
 ADAM : I can help you find it. I can take you back there. Before I die. 
 JACK : Why would you do that ? 
 ADAM : I was in the void for so long, the colors of this world almost blinded me, Jack. It was so beautiful after the darkness and the stench of fear. You gave me that. Let me do this for you. Come on. You want this. 
 He does. Jack hesitates as he considers it. He closes his eyes and remembers. 
 JACK : It's early evening... 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 Young Jack and his father are playing baseball. The sounds of the ocean off screen. Young Jack tosses the ball, Franklin hits it and starts running for the bases. They’re laughing and having a grand time together. 
 JACK (v.o.) : Just me and Dad. 
 Young Jack gets the ball and dives for the base. 
 FRANKLIN : Oh, no, you don't ! No, you don’t ! 
 Young Jack reaches the base first with Franklin chasing after him. 
 YOUNG JACK : You're out ! 
 They laugh. 
 FRANKLIN (sighs loudly) : Ah, ah, ah... You know, one day, you’re not going to want to play with your old dad any more. 
 YOUNG JACK : Never.

 Gray runs up to them. 
 JACK (v.o.) : Me, Dad and... 
 GRAY : Dad ! Mom said I could play too. 
 JACK (v.o.) : ... Gray. 
 YOUNG JACK : Hey, Gray ! 
 Young Jack runs up to him, hugs him and swings him around and around. 
 FRANKLIN : Hey, Gray. All right, son. One more. 
 Franklin tosses the ball to Young Jack, who catches it. 
 YOUNG JACK : Okay. 
 Young Jack tosses it to Franklin. Franklin hits it and it goes flying past Young Jack. Jack is standing in the back watching the memory play out. 
 YOUNG JACK : Whoa, I'll get it. 
 Young Jack turns and runs after the ball. 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – ADAM’S CELL – CONTINUOUS 
 JACK (laughs) : I'm running for the ball ! 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 Young Jack reaches the edge of the hill where it dips downward. Someone is there holding the ball. 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – ADAM’S CELL – CONTINUOUS 
 This part of the memory isn’t familiar with Jack and his smile fades. 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 Young Jack runs down the side of the hill toward the boy, tossing the ball up and catching it with one hand. 
 JACK (v.o.) : Some other boy is there. I don't know who. 
 YOUNG ADAM : Can I play ? 
 YOUNG JACK : Who are you ? 
 YOUNG ADAM : My name's Adam. 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – ADAM’S CELL – CONTINUOUS 
 Jack shakes his head. This isn’t right. Adam watches Jack, manipulating himself into Jack’s memory. 
 ADAM : Let me play. Before it gets dark. 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 YOUNG ADAM : There's lots of room. 
 Young Jack pushes Young Adam down. Behind them, Franklin and Gray appear at the top of the hill. Franklin saw that. 
 FRANKLIN : Hey ! What are you doing ? 
 Franklin runs down the hill toward them. 
 FRANKLIN : Are you all right ? 
 Young Adam stands up. 
 YOUNG ADAM : I just want to play. 
 FRANKLIN : He can play. 
 YOUNG JACK : No ! No, no, he doesn't belong here. I don't want him playing with us. 
 YOUNG ADAM (offers his hand) : I'm Adam. 
 YOUNG JACK : Don't touch my dad. 
 Young Jack pushes Young Adam down again. 
 FRANKLIN (to Jack) : Hey, easy ! Are you all right, Adam ? 
 Franklin offers his hand and helps Adam back up to his feet. This time, it’s adult Adam and he’s inside Jack’s memory. 
 ADAM : Yes, he just doesn't want to share. 
 FRANKLIN : Right. (To Young Jack) : Well, if you're going to behave that way, we're going home. 
 Franklin turns to leave. 
 YOUNG JACK : No. What ?! 
 FRANKLIN : Come on, Gray. 
 Franklin and Gray walk away from Adult Jack, who is in his own memory. 
 JACK : No ! We don't leave yet. We play some more, it gets dark, we light a fire... Mum joins us. 
 Franklin looks back at Jack deliberately. 
 FRANKLIN (to Gray) : Come on, son. I'll race you. 
 GRAY : Race you ! 
 They leave Young Jack with Adult Adam. 
 YOUNG JACK : Dad ! 
 Young Jack turns to Adult Adam. 
 YOUNG JACK : You did this. You spoiled it.

 ADAM : I made it happen. 
 YOUNG JACK (v.o.) : Dad ! 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 Young Jack runs up the hill after them. 
 YOUNG JACK : Dad, I love you. 
 Adult Jack runs down the hill. Thunder rumbles in the distance. Dark clouds fill the sky. 
 JACK : Dad ! Gray ! Dad ! 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – ADAM’S CELL – CONTINUOUS 
 JACK (crying) : I want the real memory back. 
 ADAM : Then let me live. That box you found contains my last good memory of you, your dad and Gray. You see, I'm a part of it now and I'll always live as long as you remember it. 
 JACK : That's why you took me back ? 
 ADAM : Wasn't it lovely ? Playing in the sand, no-one knowing what was ahead... your dad laughing. Gray, safe and happy. 
 Jack stares back flatly at Adam. He reaches down and takes out the small white pill. 
 ADAM : I don't want to die ! You take that pill and you will lose everything I've given you. Wipe me out now and you will lose all your memories of your father. He will cease to have existed for you. 
 JACK : Goodbye, Adam. 
 Jack takes the pill and bites down on it. Adam doubles over and grunts in pain. Jack staggers to the side, his hand on the wall. 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 Adult Jack is walking along the beach against the harsh wind blowing. His memory is fading. 
 JACK : Dad ! Gray ! 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – ADAM’S CELL – CONTINUOUS 
 Adam clutches his stomach in pain. Jack waits. 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 JACK (shouts) : Come back ! (Echoes). It wasn't like this ! 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – ADAM’S CELL – CONTINUOUS 
 Adam looks at his hand. It blurs. Adam blurs. He flickers in and out of existence. Jack turns and leans against the wall. Adam fades out. Jack slides down the wall and sits on the floor. 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 Jack stands on the beach against the harsh wind. 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – ADAM’S CELL – CONTINUOUS 
 Jack coughs and slowly falls asleep. 
 EXT. (BOESHANE PENINSULA) BEACH – DAY – MEMORY 
 Jack is left alone on the beach in a haze of wind that obscures him from vision. The memory of that day fades quickly. 
 JACK (shouts) : Dad ! Gray ! 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – CONTINUOUS 
 Jack sits on the floor outside the empty cell. With one last sob, he puts his head down and sleeps. 
 CUT TO : 
 EXT. CARDIFF BAY (STOCK) – DAY 
 Overhead view of the bay area. Bright sunny day over calm waters. 
 INT. THE HUB – VAULTS – MORNING 
 Jack is slumped on the floor, sleeping. He wakes up and looks around. He takes a deep breath. 
 INT. THE HUB – WORKSTATIONS – DAY 
 Owen is at his workstation. They’re in yesterday’s clothes. Toshiko is at her workstation in the back. Jack walks in. 
 GWEN : Jack ? How have we lost two days ? 
 JACK : What d'you mean ? 
 IANTO : The last 48 hours. None of us can remember a thing. 
 TOSHIKO : The system's blank, the CCTV's been wiped. What's been going on ? What've we been doing ? 
 JACK (thinks about it) : I don't know. 
 OWEN : Great. That's two days of my life that I'll never get back ! 
 Jack motions to the flowers at Toshiko’s workstation. 
 JACK : Looks like Toshiko got herself a secret admirer, though. 
 OWEN (puts on jacket) : Oh, yeah ? 
 TOSHIKO (reads) : To Tosh, love and apologies, Owen. (Smiles). They're from you ! 
 OWEN (snorts) : In your dreams, Tosh. I think someone's winding you up, darling... No, I don't do flowers... (Owen takes the card from Toshiko and reads it himself). And I definitely don't do apologies. 
 Her face falls. He gives her the card back and gives her a small smile. He turns to leave. 
 CUT TO : 
 INT. THE HUB – JACK’S OFFICE – DAY 
 Jack takes out the box artefact from a plastic bag. It was on his desk. Something small falls out. He looks at it. It’s a small piece of the box. He picks it up and looks at it. Ianto walks in. 
 IANTO : Did you, uh, call ? 
 Jack holds up the book. 
 JACK : Found your diary. 
 IANTO (holds out his hand) : Yep, been looking for that. 
 He takes the diary from Jack and turns to leave, his back to Jack. 
 JACK : And for the record... measuring tapes never lie. 
 IANTO (mouths silently) : Oh, f*ck. 
 Ianto leaves the room quickly. 
 JACK (shouts) : Hey ! 
 Jack holds up the Torchwood plastic artefact bag. On it is written, "ADAM’S PROPERTY". Ianto pops back into the office. 
 IANTO : Yep ? 
 JACK : Who's Adam ? 
 IANTO : Don't know. 
 Ianto pops back out. Jack looks at the plastic bag, then puts it down. He looks at the small piece which could possibly be a key of sorts. He looks at the box, turning it around. He finds the pattern at the top of the box and fits the key piece into it. It snaps into place. Nothing happens. Jack puts the box down on the desk and starts for the door. The box opens. Jack stops, turns around and looks at the box. He heads back to his desk, picks up the box and looks inside. He pours out fine sand into the palm of his hand. That’s all. He puts the box down on the desk and looks at the sand as it slips out between his fingers. He stops and thinks about it. He drops the last of the sand onto the desk and we...
