 Do you want to stay in here and learn Spanish, or do you want to come outside and have some fun with your old man, huh?

 And Martinez make a run for it.     
 [AS MARTINEZ]: Octavio, vámonos!     
 Vámonos, mi amigo!     
 Octavio accelerates but Homelander laser blasts out the tires... bzz...     
 - Boom!

 Martinez gets out of the car, dazed, looks up...     
 Homelander.     
 [AS HOMELANDER]: You're under arrest.     
 Oh-ho-ho.     
 And he slaps the handcuffs on Martinez, the cops take him away, Homelander turns to the other heroes.     
 [AS HOMELANDER]: We should work together more often.

 And, gang, that's just the teaser.     
 Look, this is not just a superhero...

 And I want to shoot the whole thing hand-held, right?     
 Very Greengrass, very grounded.     
 I want to take the audience and literally put them... boom... right there in the action.     
 But what's the plan on Translucent?     
 That's a great question. Okay, we're gonna take a stuntman, put him in a jumpsuit and just CG him out.     
 And... f*ck, I don't want to jinx this, but Lin-Manuel Miranda wants to do the voice.

 Um, this... [GROWLS PLAYFULLY]

- Thank you so much.     
 This script is a great start.     
 Really good bones.     
 Uh, I just have a few headlines.     
 Yeah, totally. Listen, we can tweak dialogue right up to the day of production.     
 Yeah, it's not really tweaks. It's more... global.     
 Okay, yeah. What are we, um...     
 What are-what are we thinking?     
 Oh, um, like, uh... you write all women as either unknowable Hitchcock bitches or Michael Bay f*ck dolls.     
 I mean, I get that a lifetime of jerking off to Transformers didn't exactly make you popular with the ladies, but, um, a little effort would be nice.     
 You know what I'm saying?     
 Um, excuse me, but I do have two sisters.     
 Thank you very much.     
 - Oh. 
- And, uh, excuse me, but Homelander really loves this script.

- Sir, is it true?     
 - What they're saying? 
- We're investigating.     
 Sir, I have to tell you something.     
 We have to tell Homelander, and I have to admit something to you. I...     
 You don't have the faintest idea where Homelander is.     
 He will know when I want him to know.     
 Just keep the rest of the infants on  in check, will you?     
 [SHUDDERING EXHALE]     
 THOMAS ROBERTS: ...and if you are just tuning in, we have some major breaking news.     
 Superheroes are not born but made, in fact created by a chemical serum, Compound V, produced and administered by Vought International...     
 - [CHUCKLES] 
- ...the company that has been the corporate face of superheroes for decades.     
 - [SONIC BOOM] 
- Now, we don't know where their superpowers     
 - actually came from. 
- What... did you do?     
 I don't know what you're talking about.     
 Oh, come on.     
 I saw you with the V in your hand.     
 Yeah, and you let me walk away with it, so... this is kind of on you, too.     
 If I go down, you come with me.     
 Pretty sure they'd kill us both.     
 [SIGHS HEAVILY]     
 You don't get it.     
 You don't f*ck with the money.     
 You never f*ck with the money.     
 We're gonna lose everything... 
I mean, cars, houses, bonuses...     
 There are more important things.     
 You know, the only people that say that... are the people who grew up with money.     
 ROBERTS: ...provided evidence proving Vought has been administering Compound V to children for decades.     
 Our very own reporting suggests the parents also received a very generous payment.     
 - It started when I was nine. 
- Now, after the kids were treated with Compound V, they were then monitored...     
 I was at the mall.     
 And we, uh... we passed the pet store...     
 ...and I heard the goldfish begging for their lives.     
 They were begging.     
 And after that, I...     
 The beach, the aquarium, Red Lobster...     
 I mean, I thought I was going crazy, you know?     
 But my mom said it was a gift.     
 That I was born this way.     
 But I wasn't.     
 It didn't have to be this way.     
 - I could've been normal. 
- ROBERTS: But early reports seem to suggest the first manifestation of powers     
 - can cause fear and anxiety 
- [SOBBING] in the affected children, especially if they are not carefully guided through the process.     
 - [SOBBING] 
- So far, Vought has refused to release a statement.     
 Likewise, Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum, former C.S.O. at the company, refusing comment.     
 He's been in seclusion since an undisclosed accident     
 - left him paralyzed. 
- Uh, hey.     
 Is this you?     
 Vogelbaum all but disappearing from public life.     
 You did it.     
 We did it.     
 Um, call me. Call me back when you get a chance.     
 - [PHONE BEEPS OFF] 
- ...on their stock price, which is already falling today,     
 - MOTHER'S MILK: Did what? 
- signaling a huge trend that could be potentially catastrophic to Vought's bottom line.     
 - You did this? 
- [NEWSCAST CONTINUES]     
 Uh, yeah. S-Starlight did, mostly, I'm pretty sure, but I just gave her an old alley-oop.     
 [QUIETLY]: Hughie.

 - Okay. [LAUGHING] 
- Hughie!     
 Dude, look at what you f*cking did.

 Me and Starlight, but yeah.     
 - Petit Hughie? 
- The f*cking kid.     
 - Mm! 
- Oh, sh1t.     
 Yes!     
 - No, no, no, no, no, no. 
- Nice one.     
 MOTHER'S MILK: That's all you got?     
 We've been trying to do this sh1t for years.     
 Vought's finally f*cking going down, the kid did it, and "nice one"?     
 All right, real nice one.     
 You can't even give me this, can you?     
 Not one goddamn win.     
 I'll tell you what.     
 When we're all done here,     
 I'll buy you a nice, big, family size bottle of top-shelf lube and I'll tickle your balls till you beg me to stop and even then I won't.     
 I just won't do it.

 As you can imagine, this has been a very difficult day for the Vought family.      
 Our focus now will be to learn the truth.      
 As I said, we are conducting a robust investigation into Compound V, but let me be clear:      
 I had no knowledge whatsoever.      
 We believe it was the work of a small, disaffected group of scientists led by former Vought employee Madelyn Stillwell.      
 But sadly, there are more important matters at hand.      
 Everyone at Vought sends their thoughts and prayers to those families that were affected today.      
 Though it is important to acknowledge that this tragic event could have been far worse, today's attack underscores just how dangerous the threat of Super terrorists has become.      
 And, at a time like this, America needs its heroes more than ever.      
 We live in a dangerous world.      
 Our brave heroes were already fighting terrorists overseas, but now, America faces this war on a different front: right here at home.      
 These enemies will stop at nothing to infiltrate our borders and attack our citizens.      
 Our superheroes are the last line of defense.      
 And today, the death toll would have been much higher had it not been for the brave actions of our newest hero,      
 Stormfront, who stopped the terrorist before he could take more innocent lives.
