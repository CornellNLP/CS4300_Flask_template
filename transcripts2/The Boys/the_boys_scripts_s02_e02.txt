 [EXHALES]   
 HOSTESS: Hi.   
 Welcome to Endless Pasta Week at Tony Cicero's.   
 Where the f*ck am I?    
 You're at Tony Cicero's.    
 No, no. What f*cking city am I in?    
 Uh, Fort Wayne.    
 The f*ck?    
 You got a bit of paper, something I can write with?    
 A pen, anything.    
 [MUTTERING]: Ah, f*ck it.    
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]    
 NEWS ANCHOR: Yesterday, it closed at ten percent below its record high, set last month.    
 Federal authorities have initiated a multistate manhunt for William Butcher for allegedly murdering    
 Vought Vice President Madelyn Stillwell as well as endangering her infant son, Theodore.    
 Law enforcement officials have set up a tip line and are urging anyone with information regarding the suspect's whereabouts to come forward.    
 Police are also asking...    
 [SNIFFLES]    
 ["INDÉ-STRUCTIBLE" BY GUIZMO PLAYING]    
 "Boy, girl".    
 I am sorry.    
 I do not understand.    
 All right, I'm off.    
 - HUGHIE: Where you going? 
- Going to meet a contact.    
 Who?    
 Someone who can help us find this Supe terrorist c**t.    
 Who is the contact?    
 What is their actual name?    
 - You'll love it. 
- No, I won't.    
 I won't love it. I never love it.    
 I never f*cking love it!    
 Noted.    
 Not a word from him.    
 He left us for dead, and now it's like nothing happened?    
 You're right.    
 I am sorry.    
 Sorry that I trusted this lot was smart enough to save themselves like they've done a hundred times before.    
 Okay, well, where you been?    
 Well, technically, I called him back.    
 He blew up Madelyn Stillwell.    
 I told you. She was already dead when I blew her up.    
 Oh. Great. Cool.    
 Totally. We're just gonna pretend like this is normal?    
 Like we're f*cking lemmings?    
 Well, who else they gonna follow?    
 Right.    
 [BIRDS CHIRPING]    
 [GRUNTS]    
 [LAUGHS SOFTLY]    
 Hey. You know, my dad, he had a ball from the '   World Series.    
 Signed by Don Larsen himself.    
 Pitched a no-hitter in Game  .    
 Really?    
 Pretty cool, huh?    
 Ooh. That's okay. Uh...    
 You'll, uh, you'll get the next one.    
 - Yeah. 
- Yeah!    
 RYAN: Yeah, I'll get the next one.    
 [SIGHS]    
 Okay.    
 Ryan. Use your powers.    
 What do you mean?    
 RYAN: Huh.    
 I can't do that.    
 Yes, you can. You're my son.    
 Has anyone told you what you're capable of?    
 No.    
 Well, then it's about time you found out.    
 BECCA: Hey, Ryan? Come on. Math time, buddy.    
 Chapters    and    in your workbook.    
 [EXHALES] Yeah.    
 Math, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.    
 BECCA: It's your favorite.    
 Be in in a minute, okay?    
 HOMELANDER: You know, when I was his age,    
 I was breaking the sound barrier.    
 He can't even throw a fastball.    
 We thought it was best that he have as ordinary of a childhood as possible.    
 We?    
 - Who's we? 
- Look,    
 I just want my kid to be normal.    
 Well, then, it's a good thing I'm here.    
 'Cause my son is the furthest f*cking thing on this planet to a normal little boy.    
 How long are you planning on staying?     
 Becca, we had a deal.     
 A deal that is alive and well     
 and-and running around as free as a goddam bird.     
 So, let's just try and be civil, shall we?     
 Did I get 'em right?     
 There's...     
 There's no correct or incorrect answer.     
 Oh.     
 What is missing here?     
 DEEP: Uh...     
 Deep, how do you expect to be welcomed back into the Seven if you can't be honest with yourself?     
 Carol, if I'm being honest,     
 I don't know what the f*ck you want from me.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 Hey, guys.     
 How's it going?     
 Can I have a word?     
 I don't mean to be negative, but his operating perspective is functionally nonexistent.     
 [WHISPERING]: I don't think there's a path here.     
 Leave it to me.     
 [TEA KETTLE WHISTLING]     
 EAGLE: See, you're just inhibited by suppressive energy, that's it.     
 Just got to realign things.     
 What is it? Shrooms?     
 Last time I did shrooms was at a Goo Goo Dolls concert with some poli sci chick from Oberlin.     
 I guess I'd call it more of a gateway.     
 [COUGHS SHARPLY, CHUCKLES]     
 Wait. Are you not gonna drink any?     
 No. Deep, this is your journey.     
 STARLIGHT: Who's revving up the girl power in the Seven?     
 Keep watching, WDCS,     
 Cleveland's first and best source for local news.     
 MAN: Quiet, please. Going again. On the bell.     
 - [BELL RINGS] 
- MAN  : Rolling.     
 Where should I start? Are you ready to meet the newest member of the Seven?     
 See it here first, WFAK.     
 KMFT. WDCS.     
 - WOMAN: Cut! 
- Quiet please. Still rolling.     
 She's the newest member of the Seven, and she's taking America by storm.     
 From Portland to Seattle.     
 Watch what comes next, KMFT.     
 ASHLEY: Amazing.     
 Do you need to take a break, or can we power through the rest?     
 Let's just power through.     
 - [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] 
- [CHEERING, INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 WOMAN: Hey, over here! Give us a shot! Gorgeous!     
 - [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] 
- Starlight! Oh!     
 - Stormfront, over here! 
- Stormfront, show us what you got!     
 - We're ready! 
- [REPORTERS OOHING]     
 - [WHOOPING AND CHEERING] 
- [LAUGHS]     
 ASHLEY: Okay, ladies, we have a big day... domestic outlets until noon, ten minutes each, foreign until  :  .     
 Round tables until  :  , print one-on-ones until  :  .     
 Jesus, if she vibrates any faster,     
 - that stick up her ass is gonna explode. 
- [LAUGHS]     
 - [PHONE BUZZING] 
- We really should be powering through.     
 We don't have time.     
 Hello?     
 What?     
 When?     
 Okay. Thank you.     
 ASHLEY: We're going positive, we're going female, thoughtful but upbeat.     
 - Where... What? 
- MAEVE: I gotta go.     
 - What? No. 
- I'm sorry. Family emergency.     
 - Is everything okay? 
- Maeve, we've never had three women in the Seven before.     
 This is a moment. Girls get it done. You are not...!     
 I have a family emergency, too.     
 PASTOR: A reading from the Book of Revelations.     
 "And God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes, and there will be no more death".     
 Today, we say goodbye to Susan Raynor.     
 For though her body rests, her soul lives on for all eternity.     
 And one day, you will think of Susan with joy as well as sadness.     
 They are two sides of a coin you will carry forever.     
 And you are blessed to have your family and your friends to help you carry it.     
 In the name of Christ. Amen.     
 [TWO BEEPS]     
 [SIGHS]     
 You think you can surprise me?     
 I literally taught you this one.     
 Hello, Grace.     
 You promised I'd never see you again.     
 I promised... not to come to your house again.     
 A subtle but important distinction.     
 I assume you sent the edible arrangement?     
 Deluxe Bereavement Bouquet with white chocolate-dipped pineapple doves.     
 Raynor would have loved that.     
 Oi, where you going?     
 There are about two dozen federal officers in the church next door.     
 I'm gonna turn you in for the murder of Madelyn Stillwell.     
 Oh, come off it, Grace. You really think I done that?     
 You really want me to answer that?     
 Grace, I know who killed Raynor!     
 Who?     
 Okay, well, uh, I don't specifically, technically have the answer to that, but I know how to get it.     
 We think Vought killed her for getting too close to something.     
 Getting too close to what?     
 Something to do with a Supe terrorist smuggled into Jersey a couple of nights ago,     
 - and that is where we start. 
- [LAUGHING]: Honestly, it's like asking a cockroach to not be a cockroach.     
 It's just your nature.     
 I know what she meant to you, all right?     
 We find this terrorist, and we're one step closer to finding out who offed her.     
 I'm not getting back in.     
 And if I were, which I'm not, it sure as sh1t wouldn't be for you.     
 Oh, I ain't asking you all the way back in.     
 Just dip in a little toe, yeah?     
 Maybe two. Not for me. For Raynor.     
 You never gave a sh1t about Susan.     
 You're only here because you're desperate, f*cked, and you want something.     
 All right, f*ck it. Grace? Grace!     
 Grace, wait, wait, wait. Wait.     
 I'll level with you, okay?     
 [EXHALES] Just hear me out.

 Bro, we got to talk.     
 - No, you got to look at us. 
- [QUIETLY]: No.     
 Look at us!     
 [BREATHING DEEPLY]     
 [QUIETLY]: Okay.     
 Remember Melissa Dabrowski, the kindergarten teacher you fingerbanged backstage at the VH  Educator Awards?     
 So what?     
 You were supposed to present her with Teacher of the Year, but you bailed while she was pulling her panties back on.     
 Yeah, because she laughed at me.     
 Okay, bullshit.     
 She just put her hands on your chest.     
 You never even unzipped your suit.     
 She would have laughed.     
 Because that's what you do.     
 You imagine women will laugh at us, so you humiliate them first.     
 No, that's-that's not true.     
 You can't accept your own body, so you violate theirs.     
 [STAMMERS] Shut the f*ck up.     
 Shut the f*ck up. Shut the f*ck up.

 - You can't swim from us forever! 
- Let me out!     
 You shut the f*ck up, you ugly pieces of sh1t.     
 I have nothing else to say to you.     
 - We won't let you shut us up anymore, Kevin!

 What are you doing here?     
 Apparently, your work... still has "Maggie Shaw" as your emergency contact.     
 Ah, sh1t. Sorry.     
 That's okay.     
 Where else would I score this sweet jelly?     
 [ELENA LAUGHS]     
 I thought it was bad unagi.     
 Turns out, my appendix was about to burst.     
 Well, there are easier ways to get my attention.     
 I kept thinking you'd call.     
 Yeah. Me, too.     
 - You want me to call your mom? 
- [LAUGHS]     
 Definitely not. [GROANS]     
 Someone else, like a girlfriend, or...?     
 Seriously, thanks for coming, but I'm sure you have more important places to be.     
 Hey, you could die from something like this.     
 But I didn't, so I guess you don't need to save me.     
 Yeah, well, I still want to see the doctor.     
 Maeve, I'm fine, I promise.     
 [ELENA SIGHS]     
 You know, watching "Botched" doesn't make you     
 - a f*cking medical expert. 
- [SCOFFS]     
 I'll wait a while and just see, okay?     
 Can we get this middle chair out of here, please?     
 Yeah. Somebody? Thank you. Thank you.     
 Can we get the two on the side just smushed together?     
 We lost one of them.     
 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Okay, resetting; one background.     
 - All right, people, quiet on the set. 
- Rolling.     
 Well, Stormfront, congrats on the Seven.     
 Are you as excited to be here as I am?     
 I don't know! I don't think so!     
 [CHUCKLES] Can you tell us a little about how girls get it done?     
 REPORTER  : ...girls get it done?     
 REPORTER  : ...girls get it done?     
 REPORTER  : ...girls get it done?     
 Let's dish boys.     
 Starlight, single? Or, uh, spoken for?     
 Uh, single, single.     
 Single. Uh, single.     
 Definitely single. [CHUCKLES]     
 Tell us how fun it is to have all this girl power.     
 - [LAUGHS] 
- REPORTER  : Can you repeat that but say     
 "strong is the new pretty" right at the end?     
 Do girls make better heroes?     
 Do girls make better heroes than boys?     
 Do girls make better heroes?     
 Look, uh, no offense.     
 I-I get you have your talking points, but why does it matter whether heroes have a dick or a vag?     
 [CHUCKLES]: I mean, shouldn't we all just, you know, be competent at our jobs?     
 I-I don't think girls do anything better.     
 I think chicks and dicks are in it together.     
 [PHONE BUZZING]     
 Oh, that's me.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 [CHUCKLES]: Sorry, Ashy.     
 Vought won't let me have pockets in this thing.     
 You can see every crease in my ass.     
 You can practically see up Starlight's uterus.     
 You want to talk about girl power, let's talk about getting some pockets.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Starlight, your teammate, A-Train, has been out of the public eye.     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Vought recently revealed that he was on a top secret mission in Kandahar.     
 Are you worried about him?     
 [CLEARS THROAT] Yeah, of course.     
 I pray for him every night.     
 [INHALES] America really is lucky to have such a brave hero fighting for them.     
 What if I told you he's right behind you?     
 - [SONIC BOOM] 
- Here comes the A-Train!     
 What's up?     
 - Wow. 
- All right.     
 - Yeah. [CHUCKLING] 
- [FORCED CHUCKLING]     
 - Wow, welcome back. 
- Thanks.     
 Thank you. Mmm.     
 Stormfront, you know, it is such an honor to meet you.     
 - Oh. 
- I'm a huge fan.     
 - Feeling's mutual. 
- Don't get up. Yeah, relax.     
 Relax for a second. Um, maybe get a chair or something.

 So, in short, do not waste your hard-earned cash on this shitty, big-titted hunk of plastic that'll probably end up in a manatee's belly when your kid chucks it in the garbage.     
 Hey. Um...     
 I just got to say,     
 I really like everything that you've been saying about Vought.     
 Yeah, okay, cool.     
 No, I mean...     
 I agree with you.     
 You wearing a wire or something?     
 What? What does that have to...     
 Look, I mean this in the nicest possible way, but I don't need some f*cking Vought Spy Barbie sniffing around to see whether I'm a team player.     
 What? That is not at all what I am.     
 I used to be a fan.     
 But look at you.     
 You're like the Voughtiest Vought in all Vought.     
 I think, uh, cyclops dude's trying to get your attention.     
 [QUIETLY]: f*ck.     
 What happened to your eye?     
 Oh, Vought is testing a new volumizing dry shampoo for eye irritation.     
 As if you give a f*ck.     
 Here.     
 I brought you a sample.     
 Are you kidding me?     
 I can't take this right now.     
 I can't get away from this press junket.     
 I literally have no pockets.     
 You wanted the V, here it is.     
 If you threaten me again, I'm gonna make sure that everyone knows that you're the one who took it.     
 Uh...     
 - A-TRAIN: You're tight with Gecko? 
- Hey.     
 Yeah, it... From Capes for Christ, back in the day. Yeah.     
 Yeah.     
 What'd you just put in your boot?     
 What? Nothing.     
 'Cause it looked like you just put something in your boot.     
 Why don't you tell me what's in my boot?     
 [EXHALES]     
 Maybe... you shouldn't be hitting the Cristal with your buddies quite so soon.     
 Come on.     
 Let's finish dick-tickling these half-wits so we can finally do our real job.     
 Shall we?

 [PHONE RINGS]     
 - PARK: Hey, Becca. 
- What the f*ck is going on?     
 I understand this is upsetting.     
 I was told I would never have to see him ever again, that he would never know about Ryan or me.     
 That was the deal.     
 Homelander is quite upset that this information was concealed from him.     
 Corporate has made a decision not to antagonize him further.     
 [SHUDDERING]     
 You need to make him leave.     
 Because if you don't, I'm gonna take Ryan and I'm gonna run, and you'll never f*cking find us ever again.     
 I think we both know that that's not possible.     
 You have to protect us.     
 You have...     
 You have to move us, please.     
 I'm sorry. Now that he knows, there's just no putting the toothpaste back in the tube.     
 You should probably be getting back.     
 Piano lessons are almost done.     
 Just keep him calm.     
 Our best guess... he'll get bored and move on.     
 You-you don't know that.     
 You don't.     
 Do I get to keep this?     
 MAEVE: Maybe.     
 What will you trade me for it?     
 I will let you take me out to dinner.     
 Right.     
 I forgot. We'll need to order in, keep it low-pro.     
 Maeve, what are you doing here if nothing has changed?     
 [LAUGHS]: Oh, Christ.

 [TAKES DEEP BREATH]     
 Homelander and I went to this Oscar party for    Years a Slave.     
 There was this producer, he swapped place cards so he could sit next to me.     
 And he chatted me up all night.     
 Two days later, there's a fire in his office.     
 They found his head in one room... and his torso in another.     
 What are you saying?     
 I don't want him to do that to you.     
 Who?     
 Homelander?     
 You think Homelander did that?     
 The things... that I've watched him do...     
 ...the things that he made me do...     
 If he ever finds out about you...     
 [TAKES DEEP BREATH]     
 Why are you telling me this now?     
 I don't want you to hate me anymore.     
 Cool.     
 - Thank you.

 You're welcome.     
 It's crazy you don't have one already, actually.     
 I don't really have anyone to call, though.     
 [SIGHS]     
 You could call me.     
 You know, Ryan, um, when I was your age, I didn't have many friends either.     
 Mom says being lonely makes you know yourself better.     
 Well... that's not wrong, I suppose.     
 Can I tell you a secret?     
 Man-to-man, you know?     
 [SIGHS]     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 My dad and I... we never played catch in the yard with a World Series ball.     
 Truth is...     
 I never had a dad.     
 Or a mom.     
 Wait, you... you didn't?     
 See, sometimes it's hard, Ryan, being... [SIGHS] superior to every single other person on the planet.     
 It's-it's... isolating.     
 And gods... should not have to feel that kind of... yeah, pain.     
 Because that... is what we are, Ryan.     
 You and me.     
 We're gods.     
 Son, we can do anything we want.     
 And no one can stop us.     
 Now, that... that's a good feeling.     
 A really good feeling.     
 And now you... and me... can share it together.     
 I...     
 I-I should probably go to bed now, you know?     
 Sure.     
 [PATS RYAN]     
 I love you, son.     
 You know, you can say it back.     
 Um, I...

 This is nice.     
 - Your turn, Mom. 
- You need to leave.     
 Excuse me?     
 You need to get the f*ck out of my house.     
 What happens one day when Ryan asks to go to a baseball game, swim in the ocean, or eat at a Burger King?     
 How do you think he's gonna feel when he finds out that you've lied to him his whole life?     
 You think he's gonna be happy that you kept him in this pretty prison?     
 Or... do you think he'll f*cking despise you?     
 Hmm?     
 Let's go ask him.     
 Don't.     
 You were right.     
 I'm not gonna get bored and move on.     
 I'm not going anywhere.     
 So feel free to tell Dr. Park to go f*ck himself.

 Pippi didn't care.     
 She never cared about being polite.

 I thought he just wanted to humiliate me, show me what he'd done to my girl before he gave me the good news.

 God knows why.

 Wow.     
 All those needles jammed into her arm at the same time?     
 I mean, one of them actually shattered the bone.     
 Did you know that? Would someone really do that to themselves?     
 I mean, doesn't look like an accident to me.     
 I mean, Vought's happy to bury it, but, you know, say, if...
