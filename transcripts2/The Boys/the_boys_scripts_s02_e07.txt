 Holy sh1t!   
 We are going to hold hearings on Vought and Compound V!   
 I'm the world's greatest superhero.   
 You're my greatest failure.   
 STORMFRONT: I do like you.   
 You've got spunk.   
 You're gonna be a big help to me.    
 What the hell does that mean?    
 - [SCREAMING] 
- That's f*cking Lamplighter.    
 These people are test subjects.    
 They're trying to stabilize the V.   
 Anywhere, anytime, you get a solid Supe.   
 Why would Vought do that?    
 We are in a war.    
 For the culture.    
 But we can fight back  with an army of supermen millions strong.    
 Everyone I have ever loved is in the ground.   
 And then I found you.   
 We found each other.    
 - [BEEPING] 
- RADIO HOST:    % of the public   
 is hard-core aware now   
 and know how the system works.   
 And then we don't do anything about it.   
 That's why Super terrorists continue to invade America.   
 There are illegal immigrants pouring into this country every day, and any one of them could be a Super terrorist.    
 NEWS ANCHOR:  Many are calling for more superheroes in order to counter   
 the Super terrorist threat and protect Americans.   
 STORMFRONT:  What is our government doing about this?   
 - Got to go. I'm late for class. 
- Thanks.    
 - All of us... 
- Have a good day, hon.    
 ...we need to stand up right now.    
 I am sick of waiting for some executive   
 to finish his racket...   
 VICTORIA:  We are going to hold hearings  on Vought and Compound V...    
 That's $ .  .    
 STORMFRONT:  I'm gonna tell you something I probably shouldn't.   
 I'm gonna tell you something   
 that the government doesn't want you...   
 - [BEEPING] 
- RADIO HOST:  And they want   
 more Super terrorists. That's...   
 Many people are pointing out that the rush to judgment by the left...   
 - MAN:  Victoria Neuman's accusation that... 
- No offense.   
 - I get you have your talking points... 
- Have a good day, hon.    
 ...but why does it matter    
 what some supervillain-loving snowflake has...   
 Every minute we waste...   
 One Super terrorist    
 has already gotten through. More will come.   
 - That's $ .  . 
 - And, I mean, for all we know...   
 these maniacs could have already flown   
 over our borders and be standing next   
 - to you right now... 
- You all right, pal?    
 - ...just waiting for their chance 
- Yeah.    
 ...to kill us all.   
 Keep America safe again. And I am so glad    
 that I was there this time. But what about...   
 - I am counting on  you . 
 - Have a good day, hon.   
 STORMFRONT:  Every minute we wait...   
 No, it's up to us.   
 We have to make our voices heard.   
 [OVERLAPPING STORMFRONT CHATTER]    
 STORMFRONT:  I am counting on you   
 to show us the way.   
 Don't let me down.   
 Hey.    
 [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV]    
 Whoa. Whoa, whoa.    
 I saw the light in your eyes.    
 - Just-just take the money. 
- You one of them?    
 - You a f*ckin' supervillain? 
- What?    
 - Are you a bulletproof m*therf*cker?! 
- No. Please.

 LAMPLIGHTER:  Look, I told you.   
 Stormfront gave the orders.    
 I just executed them.    
 It was, um...    
 - It wasn't easy. 
- Yeah,    
 I think we can all agree that you're the real victim here.    
 Now, let's cut the sh1t and go over it again.    
 - From the start. 
 - I had just left the Seven.   
 And Mr. Edgar invited me to his club.   
 MALLORY:  Put away that petulant look   
 - before you hurt someone with it. 
- Yeah,    
 I should be chuffed we're pissin' away the best asset we ever got our mitts on.    
 - And your plan would be? 
 - Same as always.   
 Squeeze the c**t till he gives up the next c**t, then kill the f*ck when we're done.    
 I have no doubt you'd be happy with that unending cycle of brutality.    
 How can you not want blood for what he done?     
 He's willing to speak against Vought at the hearing.     
 We've never had Congress on our side before.     
 Congress. Please.   
 What a bunch of corrupt f*cking c**ts they are.     
 Oh, come on, you're not the first person to call me a c**t, Mr. Butcher.     
 I'm starting to think it's like a... badge of honor.     
 Term of endearment where I come from, love.     
 Mm.     
 Well?     
 Opposition's gonna have a field day with him.     
 Disgruntled ex-Supe? I am fairly sure   
 he's f*cked half the Sacred Heart cheerleading squad.   
 But, yeah, he'll be a good witness.     
 It's not enough, though.     
 BUTCHER:  Not enough? If torturing and burning  a bunch of mentals on Vought's say-so ain't enough for you muppets, then what the f*ck are you good for, huh?     
 - A strongly worded tweet? 
- LISA:  You're a wanted felon, asshole.   
 - We don't need your help. 
- Yes, we do, Lisa.     
 Mr. Butcher here has fought Vought harder than we ever have.   
 But I would like a turn.     
 If we can... trust each other.     
 HUGHIE:  Uh, I think we can.   
 - Trust each other. 
- Hold still.     
 MALLORY:  What do you need?   
 Okay, we know what they were doing at Sage Grove,     
 - but we don't know why. 
- [PHONE RINGING]     
 Why test Compound V on patients?   
 What do they want? I need the full picture.   
 If we're gonna take a shot at the king, we can't f*cking miss.     
 We know someone who might know the full picture.     
 Oh, well, that's f*cking rich, isn't it?     
 Who is it?

 Okay. Sorry.     
 J-Just nervous.     
 When did you get to town?     
 I never left.     
 I've been staying at the Days Inn in Newark.   
 I'm not leaving until we talk this out.     
 I know what I've done to you.     
 Believe me, I know.     
 Mom, it's not just you.     
 It's...     
 Do you remember that... cross that you gave me for confirmation?     
 Before every save that I went on, I would touch it.     
 Like a... football player leaving a locker room.     
 I thought that God was sending me on a mission.     
 I feel so stupid.   
 I gave my whole life to nothing.     
 That's not true.

 Colonel, you think the congresswoman is in danger?     
 She has her security detail.     
 Which will be useless if a Supe drops in.     
 She's our best chance to nail Vought, but only if you keep her alive until the hearing.     
 Oui, madame.

 So, I think, uh, we'll be around more.     
 A lot more.

 Empire Wok.     
 Hi.     
 That was a fraught "hi".     
 I'm going to my sister's for a while.     
 I have a plan.     
 You don't need to be scared of Homelander.     
 That little girl... on the plane.     
 What she must have gone through in those last few moments.     
 I lie awake every night thinking about that.     
 - Me, too. 
- But then I start snowballing and wondering... [SNIFFLES] how many other people have you killed and what else have you done?     
 - I didn't have a choice. 
- I'm not blaming you.     
 I'm not. It is not your fault.     
 Will you just... Will you s... Will you sit down?     
 - And it's not fair. 
- Will you sit down?     
 I wish I were as strong as you.   
 But I'm not.     
 I just need time.     
 [PANTING]     
 Over and over, you...  [SNIFFLES]     
 You said you wanted to see the real me.     
 This is the real me.

 He's not taking any visitors.

 Goddamn.     
 We're on the wrong team.     
 VOGELBAUM:  Moral compromise does have its privileges.   
 Grace.     
 I thought you retired.     
 Dr. Vogelbaum.     
 I thought you were taller.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Sonia, can you get some tea?     
 Thank you, but we won't be staying long enough.     
 Ah, yes, there's that WASPy patrician tone.     
 - All business. 
- Doc, what do you know about the Sage Grove Center?     
 Never heard of it. Should I have?     
 Considering Vought's been doing illegal tests there since you were the CSO and they're still doing 'em to this day,     
 - seems like you should've. 
- That's horrible.     
 Maybe it was Sonnenshine's project over in R&D.     
 Prick always did have a real god complex.     
 MALLORY:  Do you recall the deal we made?   
 In exchange for me graciously dropping certain involuntary manslaughter charges?     
 I recall it was a long time ago.     
 Doesn't expire until the statute of limitations does.     
 Then I guess I'm turning myself in.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 We don't have to do this dance anymore, Jonah.     
 [EXHALES]     
 We're both out.     
 Just a couple of retirees   
 shooting the sh1t on the back nine.   
 We both know Vought f*cked you.     
 Probably put you in that chair.     
 Help us f*ck 'em back.     
 Testify to Congress.   
 That's my daughter.     
 She took time off from her practice   
 to help a bitter old invalid.   
 I'm sorry to say this, Grace, but you're the very last person who should be asking me for help.     
 After what you lost.     
 Do what you like to me.     
 But some things are more important than the right thing.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]

 You should listen to him.     
 Ma'am?     
 Go back to your wife and daughter.     
 Nah. I'd just be putting them in more danger.     
 [LAUGHS]: Ah, yes, the self-martyring bullshit of the special ops soldier.     
 I'll get you all on a flight to Nicaragua.     
 No one sees you again.     
 When this is done, I'll take you up on that.     
 But that's the point, Marvin. It's never done.     
 You just let go.     
 No justice for your father.   
 No revenge against Vought.   
 You get nothing,   
 except your family.   
 Go and never come back.     
 I wish I had.

 My papa... when he... lost his mind, my mama, she... she kept me cooking with her.     
 Cassoulet, confit de canard,  all the mother sauces.     
 Cooking has, uh, this way of giving port in a storm.     
 Did your...  your mama... she cook?

 Once, when you stop breathing,  and again when somebody... utters your name for the last time.

 And I know that that means something to you. I do.     
 And if you take him away from me, this... this whole world will feel so confusing

 Because I love him.     
 And I know a part of you loves him, too, and that you want what's best for him.     
 But what's best for him is to be here with me, with his mother.

 Teddy Roosevelt.   
 Loved the idea of the woods, the forest,   
 manifest destiny.   
 Well, you know, I needed him to be   
 the strongest man in the world.   
 So I went to work on him.   
 He didn't even want it.   
 It was for me.   
 Hmm.     
 And that wasn't your only sin.     
 Was it?     
 It wasn't Homelander who hid my wife away all them years.

 And it'll come from someone   
 that has witnessed these crimes directly.

 - Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum.
