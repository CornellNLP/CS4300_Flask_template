 HOMELANDER: Today I can report to the American people that Black Noir has conducted an operation killing the Super Terrorist known as Naqib.

 But that doesn't mean sacrifices won't still be made.     
 The proof of that, sadly... lies before us.     
 For today, we mourn a fallen member of the Seven.     
 Translucent.     
 Murdered in cold blood by the cartel Super Terrorist El Diablo.     
 Before he left,     
 Translucent said to me... [SCOFFS]     
 Almost as if he knew something was gonna happen, he said...     
 "Hey, Homelander.     
 Tell my son Maverick that I love him".     
 And he also said,     
 "You find those Super Terrorists..."     
 Well, Super Villains is really the only term, but he said,     
 "You find them, Homelander.     
 And you stop them".     
 So I say to you, Maverick... and to all the sons and daughters of this great nation, I will stop them.     
 I will save you.

 You got to take him to the hospital.

- MAN: No one's seen it.     
 I ain't trying to get life without parole.     
 FRENCHIE: They promised me.     
 They would only smuggle in guns and cocaine and fentanyl.     
 - Not f*cking... 
- Not human f*cking cargo?     
 - Jesus Christ, Frenchie. 
- They didn't tell me.     
 Or you didn't ask.     
 A Supe.     
 FRENCHIE: Supe Terrorist.     
 They got paid to smuggle in a Supe Terrorist.     
 How about this one?     
 How does it make you feel? Anyone?     
 - I hate it. 
- That's a strong reaction, Margaret.     
 I'd love to follow up on that.     
 What do you mean when you say you hate the term "Super Terrorist"?     
 I just mean, it's really scary.     
 It makes me want to lock the door and hide under the bed, you know?     
 Which means a double-digit drop the opening weekend of the Tek-Knight movie.     
 HOMELANDER: I keep saying     
 "Super Villain" is the better term.     
 MARGARET: Uh, "Super Criminals" sounds like something in a cartoon.     
 Jill, ask them what they think about "Super Villain".     
 Uh, what about the term "Super Villain"?     
 That sounds better to me. More exciting.     
 - More exotic. 
- JILL: Okay.     
 JILL: Okay, turning our attention back to these, which do you prefer?     
 "Saving America", can I get a show of hands?     
 Okay. How about "Saving the World"? Wow.     
 Unanimous, strong reaction. 
So what is it about...     
 Nope. It's "Saving America".     
 Uh...     
 I-I don't know. I-I feel like "Saving the World" has a...     
 JILL: Okay. But is there something specific about "Saving the World" that "Saving America..."     
 It's Americans that are gonna keep us in the Army, not the f*cking world.     
 It's "Saving America".     
 Mm-hmm?

 DEEP: Hey, man.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Thanks for letting me crash.     
 Sorry, about the bathroom.     
 - I'll clean it up. 
- No need to apologize.     
 Okay.     
 Oh, sh1t.     
 - You scared me. 
- EAGLE: Oh, that's just Carol.     
 Good friend.     
 Carol, this is the Deep.     
 I have been looking forward to meeting you, Deep.     
 Would you like a Fresca?     
 Thank you.     
 Anyway, no need to apologize.     
 We've all been there. It's tough.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 - Been where? 
- Rock bottom.     
 I... [SIGHS]     
 I don't think I'm at rock bottom.     
 EAGLE: Uh, f-for me, my aha moment came with a hostage situation at Kroger.     
 Multiple shooters.     
 I showed up, I'm letting arrows fly, my aim is perfect.     
 But...     
 ...there's only so many arrows a quiver can hold.     
 I just ran out.     
 And then, we lost a lot of good people that day.     
 Then you start to question, like, f*cking arrows against TEC- s?     
 - But? 
- But I came to see that archery isn't irrelevant, it's timeless.     
 It's a pure and ancient art.     
 Carol helped me see that.     
 And what are you, his therapist     
 - or something? 
- [LAUGHS]: No.     
 No, therapy's very destructive, actually.     
 You could say I'm his teacher.     
 What about you, Deep?     
 What-what about, what about me?     
 How did you end up here?     
 You can tell her, Deep.     
 [CHUCKLES]: Tell her what?     
 About your drinking.     
 About your self-esteem issues.     
 - Really open up, Deep. 
- No, I don't...     
 I don't have a drinking... 
[LAUGHS SOFTLY]     
 - I'm fine. 
- This is a safe space, Deep.     
 CAROL: If you don't have any self-esteem issues, why are you constantly demeaning women?     
 - That's a good question, Deep. 
- Okay, thank you.     
 You know what? I don't know what the f*ck this is, but it's weird as f*ck, so I'm leaving.     
 W-We just want to help.     
 - Carol really helped me, Deep. 
- No, thank you.     
 Help you get back into the Seven.     
 NEWS ANCHOR: Yesterday, the Deep was found drunkenly ranting at children at Splash Zone in Sandusky, Ohio.     
 He was later arrested and taken to Sandusky...     
 [SPEAKS FRENCH]     
 ...he was released on bail shortly after.     
 Did you make this?     
 You wrote something.     
 "Boy".     
 What boy?     
 I do not understand. What boy?     
 [HUFFS]     
 Okay, so?     
 They were wired the money from a blind account to smuggle the b*st*rd in.     
 Cold trail.     
 Amazing f*cking friends of yours.     
 I never said they were my friends, huh?     
 I only said we will be... safe here.     
 Okay, okay, all right. What do we do?     
 Oh, you just call    .     
 What, an anonymous tip?     
 Yeah, I'm sure that'll go straight to the mayor.     
 You saw that video.     
 What if he does that to-to an airplane?     
 Or the f*cking Brooklyn Bridge?     
 So, what's your big plan, Hughie?     
 Okay, the CIA lady, right?     
 Rayner.     
 Right, the same CIA that wants to clamp our nuts into some jumper cables.     
 We could call Butcher.     
 For the last time, we don't need Butcher.     
 Then what?     
 We should... call Annie.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 "Call Annie".     
 Annie?     
 Yeah.     
 You mean Starlight?     
 'Cause that's who she is.     
 Vought has her phone so bugged... they're praying that you do that.     
 
 
 
 Oh, no.     
 You f*cking called her?     
 No, no. I'm not, I'm not stupid, okay?     
 - I texted her. 
- Oh, f*ck.     
 And then we met up, but we're getting some Compound V.     
 - f*ck you, Hughie! Are you f*cking crazy? 
- Hey, man!     
 - Are you f*cking crazy?! 
- We were careful!     
 - What the f*ck are you doing?! 
- We used burner...     
 - We used burner phones. 
- Kid, you don't get it!     
 They could've been following you.     
 They could be watching us right f*cking now!     
 If you're the f*cking reason why I can't finish that Vermont country dollhouse, I will f*cking end you.     
 You've been walking around for days like you want to kick my ass, so do it already.     
 Goddamn it.     
 [SIGHING]     
 sh1t!     
 I don't want to kick your ass, Hughie.     
 I just don't want to get dragged back into this sh1t, all right?     
 I want to get home to my wife and my kid.     
 That's it.     
 If I still can.     
 This guy could kill a lot of people.     
 Hughie... let somebody else handle it, okay?     
 There's no one else!     
 No one's coming to save us.     
 You don't get it.     
 You are not a soldier.     
 You're not a spy.     
 You're just a kid that sells stereo equipment.     
 No, I don't!     
 I don't have a job.     
 Or Robin.     
 Or my dad.     
 Or Annie.     
 One way or another, they all, uh...     
 Now all I have is this.     
 This.     
 Which is really f*cking depressing, but it's true.     
 So, maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.     
 But I can be Harry Potter.     
 Or, uh... you know, John Connor or-or-or what's her name from "The Hunger Games".     
 Katniss.     
 Yeah, the point is I could be the person that nobody thinks is awesome, but it turns out they're kind of f*cking awesome.     
 M.M.     
 Listen, we help the CIA lady, she could help you maybe get back to your family.     
 Did you ever think of that?

 My baby needs a mother!     
 Oi! Shut your trap, you dumb bird...     
 or else I'll bollocks you.

 Gecko?     
 Is that you?     
 Starlight?     
 I mean, Annie, hi.     
 - Hi. 
- Oh, my God, hi!     
 Look at you, big-time Seven hero.     
 Oh, shut up.     
 You know, I-I work in Vought Tower at the, uh, labs on-on   ?     
 Oh, you don't say?     
 I see your posters everywhere.     
 They're marketing the sh1t out of you.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 I'm happy for you, really.     
 Buy you some coffee?     
 [LAUGHS] Thank you.     
 Yeah, at the, uh, Capes for Christ Bible Camp, yes, totally.     
 Mm-hmm, that Passion play we put on?     
 You were the best Jesus.     
 I mean, no one's gonna take a nail through the hand like I can.     
 And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.     
 Oh, my God, those freckles.     
 You know he wanted to make out with me?     
 - Pontius Pilate and Mary hooking up? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 Ooh, "sacri-licious".     
 Yeah, we never did.     
 Why not?     
 - He was so cute. 
- Yeah, it just, it was what Ezekiel always said.     
 And my mom, too.     
 That God is watching over you, every second.     
 You know, I thought that He was watching us, and I thought that He'd be upset.     
 Yeah, it's a, it's a messed up thing     
 - to tell a kid. 
- Yeah.     
 But looking back?     
 I should've made out with Big Game.     
 I should've done a lot more stuff.     
 Because...there is nothing up there.     
 There's nobody in the sky watching over us.     
 Not God, not Homelander.     
 Not anybody.     
 It's all just...     
 lies.     
 I need a favor.     
 Yeah.     
 Yeah, anything for a Bible Camp alum.     
 [CLEARS THROAT, SMACKS LIPS]     
 I need you to go into the labs on   , and steal me a sample of Compound V.     
 Um...     
 I, uh...     
 I don't, I don't know what that is.     
 Ah, see?     
 Another lie.     
 I know how we're made.     
 And it is not Jesus.     
 I can't.     
 I mean, it's impossible.     
 I'm a nobody there.     
 I'm a lab rat.     
 They cut off my limbs and they grow back.     
 - I can't get you... 
- You have to.     
 Or I put this on Facebook tonight.     
 Gecko, former teen star of Vought Summertime Clubhouse, working as an S&M hooker as a side hustle?     
 I'm sure inquiring minds will want to know.     
 Annie?     
 I thought that we were friends?     
 I'm sorry.     
 But... we're not anything.

 But let's meet another hero.     
 This is Lance Corporal Dan Miller.     
 Dan and the other brave Marines of Second Battalion are helping keep you safe from the Super Villain threat.     
 We're proud to fly alongside them.     
 And now, we could use your support.     
 That's right, Maeve, with our new campaign, Saving America.     
 Here I go, you guys! Wish me luck.     
 Oh, FYI, not a real base.     
 As if Homelander and Maeve are gonna eat MREs and piss in a ditch with the rest of the grunts.     
 Uh, hey, yeah, hi, we're filming right now. Excuse me?     
 Also, you might recognize "Army Boy" as Hotel Clerk #

 You are... fun.     
 It's been a hoot, but we got work to do, so... let's get back to it.     
 Oh, totally, uh, they just wanted me to meet you.     
 Who?     
 Oh, the boys on   .     
 - I'm the new girl. 
- Wait... what are you talking about?     
 Oh! Hi.     
 I'm in the Seven.     
 Replacing Translucent.     
 God bless his soul.     
 Ink's barely dry, but, uh, yeah, reporting for duty, so... f*ck yeah!     
 Um, no, I don't think that this is, it's not true.     
 I don't know anything about this.     
 Wow!     
 Well, uh, Stormfront?     
 Who delivered the good news?     
 STORMFRONT: Oh, uh, Mr. Edgar, the big guy?     
 - MAN: All right, back to one. 
- Wonderful.     
 Great.     
 All right!     
 - Great! 
- MAN: We're going again, people.     
 Well, I think this is going great.     
 MOTHER'S MILK: You know, you ain't John Cusack, man.     
 You ain't got no motherfucking boom box.     
 - Sorry? 
- You want to get back together     
 - with Starlight. 
- No. No-no, I don't.     
 Yes. Yes, you do.     
 But this ain't the way to do it, Hughie.     
 You can't keep pulling this sh1t, man.     
 Calling her, texting her.     
 Are you crazy?     
 You know, you sound like Butcher.     
 - She's on our side. 
- I know.     
 I'm saying this for her, kid.     
 You're putting her in danger.     
 Homelander finds out that she's been talking to you?     
 She's f*cked.     
 The deeper you keep pushing her into this thing, the deeper in the meat grinder she goes.     
 RAYNER: How are you guys doing?     
 MOTHER'S MILK: We're hanging in there.     
 RAYNER: Has Butcher contacted you?     
 Nope.     
 He's completely ghosted.     
 Do you think he killed Madelyn Stillwell?     
 MOTHER'S MILK: I'd like to think that he didn't.     
 But I... I don't know.     
 Deputy Director, I know this might not be the best time to ask, but do you ever...?     
 Hear about your family?     
 Your daughter is, uh, starting soccer, I think.     
 Soccer?     
 Um, ma'am.     
 Can M.M. see them?     
 You know what, let's, let's see if this checks out.     
 And I will see what I can do.     
 Thank you, ma'am.     
 Okay, so give me the description of this guy.     
 All right, uh, about five-ten,    , black hair, wearing knockoff jeans and sneakers probably from Taiwan, maybe India.     
 You got all that from the video?     
 So, the other shoe drops, and it just crushes us all.     
 MOTHER'S MILK: Meaning?     
 Meaning I've been trying to put this puzzle together, and there's a missing piece and it's been driving me nuts.     
 And I think you just handed it to me.     
 Okay, so, then, what's the whole picture?     
 The whole picture... it's Vought!     
 It's a f*cking coup from the inside.     
 HUGHIE: Wait, what are you talking about?     
 Uh, ma'am, your nose.     
 f*ck!     
 - Let's get the f*ck out of here! 
- Holy sh1t!     
 - Holy sh1t! [SCREAMING] 
- Come on! Get in! Go, go, go, go, go!     
 Must be a Supe out there.     
 Are-are our heads gonna explode?     
 Frenchie, who do you know who could do that?     
 No one!     
 Are our heads gonna explode?!     
 Look, I have a daughter.     
 I'm worried about Super Terrorists, too.     
 But that does not mean that Vought can use that fear to control us.     
 - Morning. 
- Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry, I...     
 EDGAR: That's all right, Samantha.     
 Busy day. [CHUCKLES]     
 Morning, Homelander.     
 [TV TURNS OFF]     
 To what do I owe the pleasure?     
 Well, you never come up to   .     
 So, figured I'd pay you a visit.     
 - What a lovely idea. 
- [CHUCKLING]: Right?     
 After all, you run a superhero company, and, uh, you never check in with your superheroes, do you?     
 Like, uh... oh, I don't know... around the hiring of that girl, for example.     
 You wished to be consulted on Stormfront?     
 Well, why not?     
 I signed off on all the rest.     
 I'm the leader of the Seven.     
 For which you have my undying respect.     
 See, I don't think I do.     
 No.      
 Not even Madelyn would've dared to try and pull this kind of sh1t.      
 Of course you know how important you are to everyone at Vought.      
 No, no. Stan.      
 I am Vought.      
 You show my photo to some illiterate f*cking camel jockey in the middle of the Sahara, he's gonna turn around and say,      
 "Homelander", in perfect American.      
 You know what?      
 My contract's up, end of this year.      
 [SIGHS]      
 Maybe it's time I, uh, move on.      
 How do you think your shareholders would feel about that?      
 What do you know about Frederick Vought?      
 Excuse me?      
 Frederick.      
 Vought.      
 Our esteemed founder.      
 Well, I don't know, um, not a lot, probably.      
 I only read his autobiography...      
 - five times? 
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]      
 Not the self-serving bullshit that we peddle to the shareholders, the real story.      
 - Enlighten me. 
- Got his doctorate from Munich.      
 Ahead of his time in genetics.      
 Such the rising young star that in '  ,      
 Hitler appointed him chief physician at Dachau, where he enjoyed a ready supply of human subjects on which to test his earliest iterations of Compound V.      
 For which we condemn in the strongest of possible terms.      
 Early in '  , he felt the winds change, got spirited away to the Allies.      
 When Oppenheimer was flailing with the bomb, Dr. Vought already had practical applications of Compound V tested in the field.      
 Heroes like Soldier Boy, killing Germans by the dozen.      
 So, Roosevelt pardoned him, and he became as Wonder Bread American as Disney and Edison.      
 Well, this is a truly fascinating, if not slightly condescending lecture, but, um...      
 I don't think I see the point, Stan.      
 The point is... that you are under a misconception that we are a superhero company.      
 We are not.      
 What we are, really, is a pharmaceutical company.      
 And you are not our most valuable asset.      
 That would be our confidential formula for Compound V.      
 Which you, man-child that you are, released into the wild.      
 [SPUTTERS]      
 Don't know what you're talking about.      
 Well, let me remind you.      
 You slipped Compound V to terrorists all over the globe to get you and your cronies into national defense.      
 But maybe at the cost of destroying the whole company.      
 I don't think I appreciate your tone, sir.      
 Not much at all.      
 And I don't appreciate that the FDA now knows about Compound V, or that it's only a matter of time before the public finds out.      
 While you're preening at the Golden Globes, we're busy, running around like maniacs trying to clean up the mess you made.      
 I don't have to consult you about Stormfront or anything else.
