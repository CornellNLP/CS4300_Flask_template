 (EXERTING) 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Be careful. 
 A/C have very dangerous material. 
 Ya, ya. Fluorocarbons, freons, clingons. 
 I know all that. 
 You should call Frank. He fix. 
 Frank is okay, but he's not A/C specialist like me. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (STRAINING) Here. Here. Here, take. 
 You have safety gloves? 
 Why? You get your nail done? 
 Just take from shelf. 
 (GROANING) 
 Oh, dear Jesus, give to me strength, like a Samson, like a King David. 
 Like Incredible Hulk! 
 (GRUNTING) You have it, Mr Chin? 
 (STRAINING) Here. Here. Here, take! Take! 
 I don't have it! 
 Here, take. 
 Take. It's coming! 
 I don't have it! 
 (VOCALISING) 
 (STRAINING) 
 Take over. Hurry, hurry. 
 I don't have it. 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) Take over. 
 Mr Kim, this too dangerous. 
 Frank can fix. And he need the work. 
 Frank not working because he talk too much. 
 Nobody want to listen to Frank. 
 (GROANING) 
 What I tell you? A/C is very dangerous. 
 Can I keep these? 
 Get out. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Umma, what's going on? 
 Oh, your cousin Nayoung, she come all the way from Korea. 
 She need Canada clothes. 
 Did they lose her luggage? 
 No. 
 Where your turtleneck? 
 Umma, I haven't had a turtleneck since... 
 Oh, you still wear this? 
 It's a blanket, Umma. What's going on? 
 You cousin, Nayoung. She very nice, but she not wear enough clothes. 
 She, you know, Korean style girl. 
 What does that mean? 
 There's a lot of Korean girls and a lot of Korean girl styles. 
 She dress too much like a... What's the word... 
 Slut. 
 Did you just call Nayoung a slut? 
 No! I say she dress like slut. 
 She's super sweet. 
 Yeah, very nice, still dress like... 
 Umma, do you listen to yourself? 
 I see her on Facebook. 
 She wear very short skirt. 
 And high heel shoes. 
 Make her short skirt look even more short. 
 Umma, you're judging her based on her clothes. 
 Ya. How else I judge? 
 (LAUGHING) Just because a woman dresses like that doesn't mean she's a... 
 Slut. 
 Umma, Nayoung should be able to dress however she chooses and not be judged. 
 All I'm saying if she dressing like that, she gonna get pregnancy. 
 Short skirts don't make you pregnant. 
 Ya, but they help. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Hey, you wanted to see me? 
 Yes. Please, have a seat. 
 Do you remember last month, I told you about corporate's new sales quotas? 
 Yes. 
 Do you also remember that I stressed how vital it was that we meet those quotas? 
 I do. 
 Well, the numbers came in this morning. 
 And they are not good. 
 This... 
 It's from Head Office. 
 Am I being fired? 
 I felt like I was doing a... 
 Oh, my gosh, I'm kidding. 
 I was trying to do a joke. 
 It was funnier in my head. 
 So what's happening? 
 When I said before the numbers aren't good, they're not. 
 They're great! 
 We were the number one branch in our district. 
 What, what! 
 So, I'm not fired? 
 No, sorry. 
 But read that. 
 A pair of Raptors tickets? 
 From Head Office. 
 As a thank you. You do like basketball, right? 
 I love basketball. 
 This is awesome. 
 I knew you'd like it. 
 Did I tell you that I played in college? 
 They used to call me the Rebound Queen... 
 Wait a second, I'm mixing up two different stories. 
 Anyways, congratulations fella! 
 Thanks. 
 (EXCLAIMING) 
 (SPEAKING KOREAN) 
 Janet, look, you cousin, Nayoung. 
 Nayoung! 
 Eonni! 
 You've really changed... 
 Hmm... 
 So good see you,  Eonni! 
 Oh, you is so pretty. 
 Yeah, you too. 
 (CLAPPING) 
 Nice... Costume? 
 Oh, so funny,  Eonni. - (LAUGHING) 
 Joke... 
 Oh, have something. 
 For uncle and auntie. 
 Oh, you don't have to, Nayoung. 
 What is? 
 Put coin here. 
 Oh. 
 Ah, such a good girl. 
 I was wrong, you were right. 
 Was I? 
 (WHIRRING) 
 (MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (CHEERING) 
 So happy, yeah? 
 Yeah, very happy. 
 Don't worry,  Eonni. 
 I give you one too! 
 Aw, too bad. Janet never have any money. 
 Oh, too funny, Uncle. 
 (LAUGHS) Oh! 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, Janet, you is a famous photographer? 
 Well, I'm only in first year, but my photos featured in the school... 
 You take photo me, Uncle, Auntie. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, take it. 
 Uh... 
 (NAYOUNG CHUCKLES) 
 (NAYOUNG HUMMING) 
 Heart in heart. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Okay. Say  Kakdoogee. 
 (SPEAKING KOREAN) 
 All :  Kakdoogee! 
 (CAMERA CLICKING) 
 Did you fiddle with something? 
 No, it just fall out. I don't fiddle. 
 (BELL ON DOOR TINKLES) 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 I get it. 
 Every man likes to tinker. 
 I said tinker not tinkle, if you catch my meaning. 
 (BOTH CHUCKLING) 
 It's a bit like that story with the fox and the squirrel. 
 You mean rabbit and turtle? 
 Thing about this fox, he couldn't keep his hands off things. 
 Come to think of it, they should've made the fox a woman. 
 A foxy lady, if you catch my drift. 
 Frank, air condition is still broken. 
 Yeah, yeah, okay. I just gotta get a tool from my truck. 
 Remember where we were in the story. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Hey, is this one of these? 
 Toy : Thank you. 
 (WHIRRING) 
 (MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Reminds me of my mother. 
 She was always taking money from me. 
 Frank, I see your truck out there waiting for you... 
 But she passed away last year. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Nothing would stop her from going through my wallet and grabbing some cash. 
 But she dead. 
 So time to move on, you know? 
 True. True, true, true. 
 You know, the thing is, she wasn't cheap. 
 It was habit. 
 She grew up in the Depression. 
 One of 13 kids, youngest of which was born in a shoe box. 
 Did I ever tell you that story? 
 I can't believe you got those tickets. 
 Ooh, tickets to what? 
 To this conversation. Can I see your ticket? 
 What? I don't... 
 No, you don't, so keep moving, Terence. 
 Thanks for taking me, man. 
 Who else? 
 Dude, we're gonna be sitting so close, we're gonna get sprayed by DeRozan's brow sweat. 
 I'm guessing you told Kimchee about the game? 
 Court-side! 
 Thanks again. 
 I mean, floor seats, this close to Kyle Lowry. 
 Forget Lowry. I hope we sit that close to Drake. 
 We? 
 This looks great. 
 I think. 
 Is this the type of food you eat in Korea? 
 It's a Korean restaurant. 
 Is it authentic? 
 It's very nice. 
 It's one of the best in the city. 
 It's very authentic. 
 Yes,  Eonni  is right. 
 Uh, is same, but also different. 
 Oh, so your name is  "Eonni" in Korean? 
 It just means older cousin. 
 No! Big sister. 
 Oh, right. 
 "Eonni." That's cool. 
 You is boy, so she is  "Noona"  to you. 
 Noona! Hello, Noona. 
 Actually that's not even right, because you're older. 
 Oh, then you is "Obah" to Janet. 
 Hello,  Obah! - (CHUCKLING) Obah! 
 I feel like I want to break a plate. 
 No, Gerald is  Obah. Janet is you "Yeo-Dongseang." 
 Can we just call me Janet? 
 I mean, yeah, yeah, we could. 
 Both : (LOUDLY)  Obah! 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (CLAPPING) 
 So it was Tuesday and I decide to rent a DVD. - (SIGHS) 
 Hey, did you know that stood for Digital Video Disk? 
 Yes. 
 Well, I guess you would. 
 Oh, I hope that didn't sound racist. 
 Anyway, I rented this DVD. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Actually, it must have been a weekend because it was midday. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Now, I have rented a DVD midday during the week. But not very often. 
 Also, I remember it was Saturday because that's the day I water the plants. 
 Frank, you talking too much. 
 Appa! 
 Oh, that's okay. 
 Frank just making conversation. 
 Your husband's very direct. That's what I like about him. 
 That reminds me of this bulldog I once knew named Pepe. 
 Now, Pepe... 
 Stop. 
 I can't take any more! 
 You talking too much and you story is not interesting. 
 Maybe you wife would like to listen to you long story, but I not your wife! 
 So stop talking and just do work! 
 Actually, my wife left me two months ago. 
 So, I guess she didn't like listening to my stories either. 
 I'm sorry for taking up all your time, Mr Kim. 
 Bye. 
 No, Frank, don't go. 
 (EXCLAIMS)  Aeeshcham. 
 Eonni, Oh, come on, smile. I'm hungry. Okay, we say "fighting." (SPEAKING KOREAN) All : Fighting! (CLAPPING) So, what's this? Steamed tofu stew. It's great. What do I do with the egg? Oh, Janet, show. Let's just eat. We do like this. That's how you do. I don't want egg in my stew. Obah, that's how you do. I think I know how I do. But you've never actually been to Korea. I don't have to go to Korea. I am Korean! How is everything? Good? Uh,  ooree, da, jal moko... Um, sorry, what? Um... Neh, da... (SPEAKING KOREAN) (LAUGHING) (SPEAKING KOREAN) (LAUGHING) Oh, sorry,  Eonni.  He say... I don't care what he said. And don't call me  Eonni! We're not little kids any more. You're 18. Act like a (BLEEPED) grownup! Eonni. (CRYING) 
 
 Shannon :  Hey, Jung. Jung : Hey. How're you today? I'm good. We've spoken a couple of times already. Are you excited for tomorrow? The game? 'Cause I've been thinking. We should clock out early and avoid the rush. You're the boss. Hey, can we make a pact about that? No Work-Shannon or Work-Jung when we're at the game. Just Fun-Shannon and Fun-Jung. Fun-Jung, that's even fun to say. Wow, I'm really looking forward to this. Yes, it's gonna be fun. Fun-Jung. Hey, maybe we should grab a bite first? (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) I keep picturing us at an Italian restaurant. Red tablecloths, a honkin' big bottle of red wine... Uh, sorry, but do you mind if I take this real quick? Yeah, go ahead, I'm going to see if we need a reservation. Hello? Janet : (ON PHONE)  Hi. Do you have a minute? What's wrong? Janet :  Who told you something was wrong? I could tell by your voice. Is it Umma? No, it's Nayoung. She's driving me nuts and I just lost it on her. Well, is she okay? She's fine... I think... But I wanted to talk about me. I'm not fine. Well, did they take her to the hospital? Why would they take her to the hospital? I just yelled at her, I didn't hit her. Okay, tell Umma I'll be by right after work. What? What's Umma got to do with this? Jung : (ON PHONE)  Thanks. I'll talk to you in a bit. What's wrong? That was my sister. My mom's sick. What is it? Pretty high fever. How high? In the hundreds. There's also a rash... And her heart. They're not sure if any of it is connected. Oh, I'll tell you what. You have to deal with this. And we can just play tomorrow by ear. Yeah, and just so you know, they really making it seem like it's going to be at least a two-day thing. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I can pop by with a casserole or... Thanks and sorry again. About the game. Don't even mention it. And get back to me about the casserole. I will. Janet : Hey! Oh... Oh, that doesn't look good. It's Frank. He can't fix anything. Too busy talking. So are you getting someone else? (SIGHS) You remember story in Bible? David, he the kill some man and sleep with the wife. So you killed Frank and slept with his wife? No, King David, he just sleep with Bathsheba. Everybody knowing but nobody telling to him. Then Prophet Nathan, is coming and tell truth. People don't like to hear truth, but need to hear truth. Appa, for the first time in my whole life, I agree with you. Really, first time? Yeah. I mean, sometimes you need to be honest with people. Yeah. Because some people don't know how, uh... Annoying? Yeah, annoying they is. I know. And everyone else pretends like they're not annoying because they don't want to hurt their feelings. Yeah. But we is just helping them. Exactly! 'Cause who else is gonna tell them that? Nobody. Janet, you and me is exactly same. I wouldn't say, like, "Exactly". Yeah, exactly! We is like truth telling prophet in a Bible. You know, Appa, all the truth telling prophets in the Bible had no friends. That's why we need to stick together. (SIGHS) (BELL ON DOOR TINKLING) Look who is here, Appa. Frank. Okay! See you. Mrs Kim says you have something to say. Mrs Kim sneak attack. She said... Maybe I talk too much. But also you're maybe not such a good listener. What else she say? She said you wanted to apologize. Okay. So, we good now? You didn't say anything. I say we is good. You know, you remind me of my Uncle Ned. Never could say he was sorry. I still waiting for you to say sorry. About what? You find so much to talk about everything, and not one word about your wife. (SNORTS) We know each other 10 year, and I don't know you wife left. That's you fault. It's personal. I know, but at least more interesting than when you buying DVD, or what fox say to turtle. I didn't want to bore you with it. You already boring me. Why not bore me with something interesting? It's hard, Mr Kim. It was my marriage. Marriage is hard. Being married to Mrs Kim is hardest thing I ever do. Very hardest. Harder than store. Harder than Korea army training. What's hard? Nothing. Being married. Yeah, very hard. Hardest thing I ever do. That's what I say. Why you say that? You is not married to you. You is not married to you. (BOTH TOGETHER) You see? Listen, Bernice and me, uh... That was coming for a long time. You know how it is, we... We stopped telling each other the important things. It's good to talk about important thing. Umma : Really? There is some very important thing you don't talk about. No. I not talk about because they is not important. Are we talking about your son? Okay, Frank. Enough talking. You know, we've known each other for 10 years and you never mention your son. Okay, I pay extra if everybody stop talking now. Work to be done. Everybody has work. (RUSTLING) Do you want me to go talk to him? No, no, that's okay, Frank. You know, Bernice and me. I'd hate to see that happen to you guys. (SIGHS) Best thing you can do for my marriage is fix air conditioner. Gotcha. You're an idiot! You gave up court-side seats! I can't go on a date with my boss. Alleged date. She's into me, it's a date. She may think it's a date, but unless you think it's a date, it's not a date. I already told her my Umma's sick. So tell her she died. Problem solved. You just killed my Umma. Hey, you're the one who gave her some kinda fevered heart rash. Hey! Just on my way to the game. Uh-huh. So... I guess this leaves you with an extra ticket? Yes, I meant to ask you. Do you mind covering for Terence tonight? He's never been to a basketball game before, it only seemed right. Sure. Terence : Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh, and I didn't forget about your mom. There's a casserole in the fridge. You guys have a good night. I'll be thinking about you, mister. I'm sorry I'm missing it. Go Raps! Goddammit, Terence. I'm going to bite that thumb off with my teeth. Hey. Are you okay? I got your text message. Um... Sad face, broken heart, waterfall, waterfall, waterfall, rain cloud, and... Clapping monkey? So cute. I'm so sorry. About lunch with your friend. What? No! I'm the one who should be sorry. I was out of line. Adeline? Oh! Out-of-line. There's an imaginary line and on this side is nice people, and... Way over here, that's me. I just want to have fun time together. I know. It's just we're different. That's what I like. (LAUGHS) But sometimes, I forget that we don't need to be the same to be friends. (LAUGHS)  Eonni, I don't want to be like you! Right. Here. What is? Open it. (GASPING) Janet : Pretty funny, eh? I love it,  Eonni. I still wear that t-shirt. I'm not surprised. (GIGGLING) You wanna take a photo? Take photo of us with photo. Sure. (LAUGHS) (EXCLAIMING) (CAMERA CLICKING) (EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY) (SPEAKING KOREAN) (CAMERA CLICKING) I hope Terence is enjoying himself at the game. We're not at. An unjust world. Hey... Ahn young ha sae yo! Nayoung! (EXCLAIMING)  Obah! So good to see you. Did you just come from a comic book convention? No. We come in search of beer. Eonni, you so funny. (LAUGHING) Totally not joking. Is anyone gonna introduce us? Kimchee, this is our cousin, Nayoung. So you can stop flexing. Nayoung, this is Kimchee. Hi. Hi. You name is Kimchee? It's because I'm hot. (LAUGHING)You are so funny. That wasn't... I'll get you guys a drink. Is, uh, she... Single? Yes. But sad for you, she's also smart. Well, is she smart enough to recognize the real deal when it comes dancing on in? (MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHS) Okay, okay. Oh! (SINGING) Oh, oh... You know you want it. (BOTH LAUGHING) Nice moves. Cheers. What's this? Tuna. It's not bad. Hmm. Mr Kim! You would be my wingman? I will be the Goose to your Tom Cruise. But what about Mrs Kim? It looks like double date, don't you think? Don't worry about Mrs Kim. I wear pants, too. Secret double date, Appa. Sounds like a Korean drama! Go to bed!
