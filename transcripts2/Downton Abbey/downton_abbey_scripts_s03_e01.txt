 [OPENING CREDITS] 
 
[EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE - DAY] 
[Daisy walks her bike through the village towards the church.] Spring, 1920 Matthew Crawley : Is there any news of Sybil? Lady Mary : She's still not coming. She insists they can't afford it. [Matthew raises his eyebrows with an understanding frown and nods.] Archbishop : Mr Travis, can we move forward? Reverend Travis : If I could just ask you to come down the aisle again. [Matthew and Mary nod pleasantly to Rev. Travis and smile at each other as they turn toward the door.] Reverend Travis : Can we get the troops organized? Robert, Earl of Grantham : That means me. [Robert rises from the pew.] Cora, Countess of Grantham : It seems rather hard on poor old Travis when he's doing all the work but the archbishop gets the glory. Mary : Papa was the one who wanted a prince of the church. I'd have settled for Travis. Robert : Mm. Mary : Is there really no way we can get Sybil over? It seems ridiculous. Robert : On the contrary, it's a relief. Branson is still an object of fascination for the county. We'll ask him here when we can prepare the servants and manage it gently. [Robert and Mary walk to the back of the church.] Isobel Crawley : He's making a problem where none exists. No one could care less were Branson at the wedding or not. Matthew : You must think country life more exciting than it is if you imagine people don't care when an earl's daughter runs off with the chauffeur. Isobel : Well, the fact remains she has run off with the chauffeur and they'll have to get used to it. [The archbishop calls down the aisle.] Archbishop : Mr Travis, are we ready? Reverend Travis : Er, any moment, Your Grace, any moment. [Travis walks back up the aisle.] Reverend Travis : Can we, please? [Mary and Robert stand ready and take each other's arm before starting down the aisle.] Mr Carson : That treacle tart just hit the spot, thank you, Mrs Patmore. Mrs Patmore : So, Mrs Hughes and Anna are getting the place ready to let? Mr Carson : That is the plan. [Mrs Patmore nods and leaves with a tray.] Thomas Barrow : I'm surprised Anna held onto that house. I thought they confiscated the profits of murder. Mr Carson : Mr Bates had the wisdom to transfer it to her before the trial. Thomas : I don't think I'd have allowed it, Mr Carson. Mr Carson : Then we must all be grateful you were not the presiding judge. Thomas : I still think it's funny given that he's a convicted murderer. Mr Carson : May I remind you, Mr Barrow, that in this house Mr Bates is a wronged man seeking justice. If you have any problems with that definition, I suggest you eat in the yard. [Carson leaves. O'Brien gives Thomas a unpleasant look as he smirks at her.] Isobel : I suppose you agree with Robert. Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham : Then, not for the first time, you suppose wrongly. The family must never be a topic of conversation. Cora : I'm afraid Sybil's already made the Crawleys a permanent topic. Violet : All the more reason. If we can show the county he can behave normally, they will soon lose interest in him. And I shall make sure he behaves normally, because I shall hold his hand on the radiator until he does. [Cora smiles at the half-serious remark.] Isobel : Well, I don't know this young man aside from "Good morning" and "Good night," but he strikes me as a very interesting addition to the family. Violet : Oh, here we go. [Violet shakes her head.] Isobel : And why should he be "normal," as you call it? I say he should come here and fight his corner. [Violet looks sharply to Cora for sympathy, but Cora keeps a neutral expression.] Isobel : I like a man of strong beliefs. I think I'll send them the money. Cora : Please don't. Robert's expressly forbidden it. He'd be furious. [Violet looks between her two guests with a surprised expression.] Robert : But it can't be as bad as... [Robert listens.] Robert : Look, I'll come and see you. Tomorrow. No, I insist. Right, goodbye. [Robert hangs up the phone just as Mary enters dressed for dinner.] Mary : Papa? What's the matter? Robert  (unconvincingly): Nothing's the matter. What should be the matter? [Robert exits and Mary watches him leave, wondering what's bothering him.] Mr Carson : How was London? Anna Bates : We got it all done. But I couldn't have managed without my helper. Mrs Patmore : Have you eaten? Mrs Hughes : We had a bite on the train. Mrs Patmore : Oh, sit down anyway, have a cup o' tea. [The other servants sit down and Daisy and a maid leave.] Mrs Hughes : I'll start on the final lists for the wedding tomorrow morning. [Thomas holds Mrs Hughes chair for her and then sits down, too.] Mr Carson : I've got the last of the wine deliveries coming on Tuesday. Mrs Hughes : How will you manage without a footman? Mr Carson : I agree, but I haven't time to find one now. Miss Sarah O-Brien : I've had a letter from my sister asking after a job for her son, and-- Mr Carson : Miss O'Brien, we are about to host a society wedding. I have no time for training young hobbledehoys. [A bell rings.] Mr Carson : Her Ladyship is ringing. [O'Brien pauses for a moment, then gets up to see to her duties. Mrs Hughes and Mr Carson share a look.] Cora : Well, I don't see why not. I'll ask His Lordship when-- [The door opens and Robert enters in his dressing gown.] Cora : There you are. So, I'll ask you now. Robert : Ask me what? Cora : Carson's in need of a footman and O'Brien has a candidate. O'Brien : Alfred. Alfred Nugent, milord. He's a good worker. Cora : I think it sounds perfect. [Robert stares into space.] Cora : Robert? [Robert snaps out of his reverie.] Robert : Whatever you say. [Cora and O'Brien smile at each other.] Robert : My dear, I have to go up to London tomorrow. I'll be catching the early train. Cora : That's very sudden. Do you want me to open the house? Robert : No, I'll come straight back. Cora : What are you going for? Robert : It's nothing to bother you with. [Cora accepts his answer happily and Robert goes back into his thoughts.] Anna : It's all there, every entry. John Bates : Where did you find the book? Anna : Behind the bureau. We moved it out to clean and there it was. Vera must have dropped it or something. Bates : So, what do you want me to do? Anna : Make notes on all the names: close friend, relation, workmate, tradesman, and so on. Then I'll copy those and I'll send them with the book to Mr Murray. Bates : Haven't you anything better to do? Anna  (smiles): I have not. Because I'd rather work to get you free then dine with the king at Buckingham Palace. So, what news have you got? Bates : And what news could I have in here? Oh, I've acquired a new cellmate. To be honest, I'm not sure about him. Anna : Well, just remember what my mother used to say: never make an enemy by accident. Now, do you think you can get the notes done before my next visit? Bates : I don't see what can come of it. Anna : Probably nothing. And my next idea will probably lead to nothing, and the next, and the next. But one day, something will occur to us and we'll follow it up, and the case against you will crumble. Bates : Do you never doubt? For just one minute? [Anna smiles softly.] Bates : I wouldn't blame you. Anna : No. I don't doubt that the sun will rise in the east either. Mr Carson : You're too tall to be a footman. No footman should be over six-foot-one. [Thomas, Mrs Hughes, Daisy, and O'Brien stare at the other end of the room.] O'Brien  (proudly): That can't be, can it? Since he's already been taken on. Mr Carson : But what have you done? Alfred Nugent : I was a hotel waiter after I was discharged from the army. [?] got back. O'Brien : I think to get a job as a waiter shows real initiative. Mrs Hughes : I suppose he can speak for himself? O'Brien : Why? Is he on trial? This isn't an interview, is it? Not when he's already got the job. Mr Carson : No, it is not an interview, Miss O'Brien, but he is on trial, and if he cannot match our standards, he will be found guilty. Alfred : I mean to try, Mr Carson. Mr Carson : As long as you do. Right, go upstairs and get settled in. Your aunt will hopefully find you a livery that fits. [O'Brien nods and Alfred follows her out.] Mary : Just at the start, so we've a place to sleep after the honeymoon. You can't object to that. Matthew : No, it's nice of them. Though I doubt I'll get used to taking you to bed with your father watching. Mary : (chuckle) He's so relieved we're getting married, he wouldn't mind if you carried me up naked. Matthew : (chuckle) Careful, I might try it. [They chuckle.] Matthew : I don't want to move to London or anything. I'm not kicking against the traces. Mary : Just testing their strength. Matthew : I want us to get to know each other..to learn about who we both are without everybody being there. Mary : Well, it's quite a big house. Matthew : It's a lovely house. It's your home, and I want it to be my home, too. Just not quite yet. [Mary looks at him and then nods.] Paperboy : Paper! Russia [?]! Robert : Chancery Lane. Cab Driver : Yes, sir. [Robert gets in the cab and it takes off.] Mr Murray : I have spoken to Frobisher and Currant and since I am a trustee, should the estate ever need one, we felt I ought to be the one to tell you. Robert : You make it sound very serious. Mr Murray : I am expressing myself badly if you think it is not serious. Robert : Why did we invest so much. Mr Murray : Lord Grantham, it was you who insisted we should. If you remember, we advised against it. Robert : But war would mean a huge expansion of railways everywhere. Every forecast was certain. Rail shares were bound to make a fortune. Mr Murray : Many did, but your principle holding, which was very large, indeed, was in the Canadian Grand Trunk line. [Robert stands up, getting upset.] Robert : It was the main railway in British North America, for god's sake! It wasn't just me. Everyone said we couldn't lose! We knew hard times were coming for estates like Downton, and this investment would make it safe for the rest of time. Mr Murray : Charles Hayes was the presiding genius, and since he died, the management has not...the fact is, the company is about to be declared bankrupt... [Robert leans forward on the chairback.] Mr Murray : And the line will be absorbed into the Canadian National Railway scheme. [Robert leans harder into the chairback as the news sinks in.] Robert : Are you really telling me that all the money is gone? Mr Murray : I'm afraid so. Robert : The lion's share of Cora's fortune. [Murray responds only with a look and Robert turns away to process the blow as Murray observes him.] Robert : I won't give in, Murray. I've sacrificed too much to Downton to give in now. I refuse to be the failure, the earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out. Mr Murray : I...hate to state the obvious, but if there's not enough money to run it, Downton must go. Unless you break it up and sell it off piecemeal. Robert : I couldn't do that. I have a duty beyond saving my own skin. The estate must be a major employer and support the house, or there's no point to it. To any of it. Worker : Morning. [A worker tips his hat to a woman passing by. A car drives down the street, passing the post office.] Sir Anthony Strallan : Lady Edith! [The car slows to a stop and Edith approaches with a smile.] Edith : Hello! Strallan : Hello! Edith : What are you doing here? Strallan : I'm meeting a train, but I'm too early. Edith : Oh. [Edith opens the car door and steps in. Strallan is surprised.] Strallan : Oh, I mustn't hold you up. Edith : Oh, I'm not doing anything. Strallan : Oh. Edith : I thought I'd get away from wedding panic. [They chuckle.] Strallan : Don't you like weddings. Edith : Oh, don't be silly. Of course I do. Only, I've talked of clothes and flowers, and food and guests until I'm blue in the face. [They chuckle.] Strallan : Yes, weddings can be reminders of one's loneliness, can't they? Sorry, I don't know why I said that. So, how's it going? Is your grandmother coming over from New York for it? Edith : She is. [Chuckle.] Strallan : And Sybil, is she here yet? Edith : As a matter of fact, she wasn't coming, but I think she is now. Mary had a letter this morning. Papa doesn't know yet. Strallan : He will be pleased. Edith : I do hope so. Mr Molesley : So, you'll live at the big house when you're back from honeymoon? Matthew : Not live. Stay. We'll stay there until we decide where to go. It'll be on the estate, I should think, or in the village. Mr Molesley : Not here? Matthew : No. I shall expect you and Mrs Bird to look after Mrs Crawley. [Molesley looks up in surprise.] Mr Molesley : Y--you'll not be taking me with you, sir? Only, I thought you'd be needing...a proper valet once you're married. Matthew : I've always thought of you as more of a butler who helps out as a valet and not the other way around. Mr Molesley : Oh, I'd be happy to be a valet, sir, especially in the big house. Matthew : We won't be in the big house for long. To be honest, Molesley, I want to live more simply after the wedding. [Molesley is clearly disappointed.] Matthew : And besides, Mother absolutely relies on you. Mr Molesley : Well, that's very nice to hear, sir. Thank you. Thomas : You must be exhausted, milord. You can't have spent more than two hours in London. Robert : It was sufficient. Thomas : The new footman arrived while you were gone. [Robert starts.] Robert : What? Thomas : Yes. He got the cable this morning and came straight over. Very eager. And very tall. Robert : But when did--? Never mind. Robert : Did you know about the new footman? Cora : Of course. He's already here. Robert : Why did no one tell me? Cora : What do you mean? We talked about it last night...in my room. Robert : Well, nobody else must be taken on. Absolutely no one...until things are settled. Cora : What things? [Robert hesitates.] Robert : How's the wedding going? I suppose it's costing the earth. Cora : Mary was never gonna marry on the cheap. Robert : Oh, no. Nothing must be done on the cheap. [Cora stares after Robert as he leaves.] Alfred : I feel quite nervous. O'Brien : Don't be. You've got the skill, and you've got the willingness. [Thomas passes by.] Thomas : But he hasn't got the experience. Alfred : He's right. O'Brien : Pay no attention. (towards Thomas) You've a nice manner, Alfred. You're not vain like Thomas. (to Alfred) They'll like that. Thomas : What's the matter with you? Daisy : I'm fed up. They promised me promotion. She said they'd get a new kitchen maid and I'd be Mrs Patmore's assistant. Thomas : Well, if they really promised, you should withdraw your services. Daisy : What do you mean? Like go on strike? Thomas : But don't say I put you up to it. [Daisy considers his suggestion hesitantly.] Violet : But what was in the letter? Mary : Just that Sybil's coming after all. She'll be here on Wednesday in time for dinner. [Matthew smiles.] Isobel : Will she be coming alone? Matthew : Don't make trouble, Mother. [Isobel gives Matthew a wide-eyed look. Alfred begins serving Violet's dinner himself.] Violet : Can I do it? Alfred : If you wish, my lady, of course. [Alfred puts the serving utensils in the dish so Violet can serve herself.] Violet : Are--Are you really that tall? Alfred : Yes, my lady. Violet : I thought you might have been walking on stilts. [Edith chuckles.] Mary : When does Grandmamma arrive? Cora : She gets into Liverpool on the fifteenth, so she'll be here the day before the wedding. Violet : I'm so looking forward to seeing your mother again. When I'm with her, I'm reminded of the virtues of the English. Matthew : Isn't she American? Violet : Exactly. [Matthew gives a sidelong look at Violet's insult.] Robert : Can I...help myself? [Alfred stops trying to dish out Robert's dinner.] Alfred : Oh, you want to as well, my lord? [Alfred puts down the serving utensils.] Robert : To be honest, I think you'll find that we all want to do it as well. Mr Carson  (harsh whisper): What do you think you're doing? You're not in a hotel now. Isobel : Did you train in a hotel? Alfred : I did, ma'am. [Alfred is about to pick up the utensils, then leaves them and lets Isobel serve herself. Carson glares at Alfred.] Isobel : That will be useful, won't it, Carson? [Carson avoids her look.] Isobel : Are you all set for the wedding? [Carson gives a smile.] Mary : Of course he is. Carson's motto is "Be prepared." Violet : I'm afraid Baden-Powell has stolen it. Cora : But you have all the help you need? Mr Carson : Well, I wouldn't fight the idea of a second footman, my lady. Matthew : I don't know about the rest of you, but I sometimes think it's time we lived in a simpler way. Isobel : I agree. Much cattle, much care. Robert : Always supposing we have the choice. Violet : Oh, don't say that. It's our job to provide employment. An aristocrat with no servants is as much use to the county as a glass hammer. [Violet and Edith chuckle.] Thomas : I knew this would happen. Typical. O'Brien : What's typical? Thomas : That I'd wind up looking after Mr Matthews. That's all I need. Mr Molesley : He hasn't thought it through. I'm sorry to say, but he hasn't. Anna : Are you worried for your job, Mr Molesley? Mr Molesley : Me? Oh, heavens, no. No, no, no, I'm essential to Mrs Crawley. She relies on me. That's what he said. "Essential." [The servants are irked by his pompous attitude.] O'Brien : Oh, yes. We're all essential. Until we get sacked. [Carson enters and the servants stand.] O'Brien : How was it? Mr Carson : Alfred was confused. He thought he'd been transported to the Hotel Metropole. Anna : Cheer up. You'll get the hang of it. Alfred : Will I? [The servants sit. Mrs Hughes enters and gives Molesley a friendly greeting.] Mrs Hughes : Oh, you're still here Mr Molesley. Mr Molesley : I know. I only walked over for a cup of tea and a chat. But I've outstayed my welcome. Mrs Hughes : Nonsense. Why not have a bite with us? They won't be leaving for a half hour or more. Mr Molesley : No, I better get back. I wouldn't want them to get home and me not be there to let them in. [O'Brien makes fun of him.] O'Brien : No, you wouldn't. Not when you're essential. Mary : Then why is he coming all the way here? Why not say it on the telephone? Matthew : I have no idea. Mary : If Mr Swire's lawyer wants to see you and it's urgent, it means he's left you something. Matthew : I doubt it. I would have heard long before this. Anyway, I hope not. Mary : Why? [Matthew gives Mary a look.] Isobel : Matthew! Do come on! [Isobel wraps herself tightly in her coat.] Isobel : The chauffeur's freezing to death and so am I. [Matthew looks back to Mary.] Matthew : Are you looking forward to the wedding? [Mary smiles.] Mary : What do you think? [Matthew smirks.] Matthew : I'm looking forward to all sorts of things. [Mary smirks back as Matthew leans in.] Mary : Don't make me blush. Isobel : Matthew! [Matthew looks back at Isobel, then kisses Mary on the cheek and leaves.] Sybil Branson : Dearest Papa. [Sybil kisses his cheek.] Sybil : Tell me, did you send the money? Please say yes. Robert  (confused): What money? Cora : (smiles) Hello...Tom. [Welcome to Downton. Cora approaches Tom with a bright smile and a handshake.] Tom Branson : I hope I am welcome, Your Ladyship. Mary : Of course. [Tom gives a formal nod to Robert, who doesn't respond.] Mary : Alfred, would you take the luggage for Mr Branson. Edith : There's tea in the library. Tom : Thank you. [Tom hands his luggage to Alfred. Sybil and Cora greet each other warmly as they head into the house and Tom smiles after them. He stops when he sees Carson.] Tom : (nods) Hello, Mr Carson. [Carson gives Tom a formal nod and Tom walks into the house.] Isobel : Was that Mr Charkham I saw leaving? [Isobel closes the door.] Matthew : Yes, he said to make his apologies. He was late for his train. Isobel : What did he have to say for himself? Matthew : I don't know where to start. Basically, it seems that Reggie Swire did not wish to divide his fortune. So, when Lavinia died, he made a new will with a list of three possible heir, of which I was the third. Isobel : Why didn't the first name succeed? Matthew : He died before Reggie...in the same epidemic that killed Lavinia. But at first, they thought that the second heir, a Mr Clive Pulbrook would be easy to trace. Isobel : How much money are we talking about? Matthew : A lot. A huge amount. I had no idea. You could never have told it from Reggie's way of life. Isobel : Lucky Mr Pulbrook. Matthew : Well, this is it...Sometime before Reggie's death, Pulbrook travelled to the east, to India, to some tea plantations he owned there. Isobel : And? Matthew : He's never been heard of since. They've made inquiries. They've sent an agent out to visit his property. There's no sign of him. Thomas : I'm sorry, I won't. And that's flat. Mrs Hughes : Then you'll have to do it, Mr Carson. Mr Carson  (indignant): I'm not dressing a chauffeur. Mrs Hughes : He is not a chauffeur now. Anyway, you don't have to dress him. Just see he's got everything he needs. Mr Carson : I'm not often as one with Mr Barrow, but...no. Mrs Hughes : Then Alfred must do it. Mr Carson : (scoffs) Alfred. He wouldn't' know what to do beyond collecting dirty shoes outside the door. [Thomas smirks.] Mrs Hughes : Well, he'll have to learn. [Mrs Hughes looks disapprovingly at Thomas and Carson before she leaves. Carson gives a surprised look to Thomas. Thomas shrugs his shoulders.] Violet : Is it an Irish tradition? Tom : What? Robert : She means not changing. [Tom looks down at his plain clothes.] Sybil  (irked): Of course not, Granny. Violet : It might have been. You don't change on the first night of a voyage. [Mary isn't pleased by the conversation either.] Tom : No, my lady. I don't own a set of tails. Or a dinner jacket either. I wouldn't get any use out of them. Robert : Well, I hope you own a morning coat since you're here for a wedding. Tom : No, I'm afraid I don't. Sybil : We live a completely different kind of life, Papa. Robert : Obviously. [Carson holds the serving dish at Tom's eye level.] Tom : Could you lower it a bit, please, Mr Carson. [Carson obliges.] Mary : You should buy a Downton wardrobe and leave it here. Then you won't have to pack when you come. Edith : What a good idea. [Sybil smiles at their suggestion.] Tom : I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't turn into somebody else just to please you. Violet : More's the pity. Isobel : Oh, now why should you change to please us? Matthew : What is the general feeling in Ireland now? Tom : That we're in sight of throwing off the English yoke. Isobel : Do you approve of the new act? Tom : Would you approve if your country'd been divided by a foreign power? Isobel : Well, won't it bring home rule for Southern Ireland nearer? Tom : Home rule on English terms, presided over by an English king. Matthew : Is keeping the monarchy a problem? Tom : Would it be a problem for you to be ruled by the German Kaiser? [Carson snaps a glass stem in his shock. Robert turns to look.] Robert : Carson, are you all right? Mr Carson : I've been very clumsy, my lord. I do apologise. [Sybil closes her eyes in embarrassment. Cora attempts to redirect the conversation to safer topics.] Cora : Is it true that Irish gardens have more variety than ours. [The attempt was so obvious that Robert sighs.] Edith : Oh, yes. Don't you remember Lady Dufferin's ball at Clandeboye? The gardens there were heavenly. [No one's fooled by the topic change and the Bransons both look uncomfortable.] Alfred : I thought them very down on him. Thomas : That is because you know nothing. Mr Carson : And wasn't he down on them - insulting our country, insulting the king? I thought it was a miracle His Lordship held his temper. Mrs Hughes : But it must be hard, Mr Carson, to sit up there with people he used to drive around. Tom : It is hard, Mrs Hughes. [Tom stands in the doorway. Carson bolts up from his chair and the other servants follow suit.] Tom  (hurriedly): Please, sit down. [Mrs Hughes debates, but Mr Carson remains resolutely standing and the other servants remain standing.] Mr Carson  (stiffly): Is there something we can do, sir? Tom : I just wanted to come down to say hello. I wouldn't want you to think I got too big for my boots. Mrs Hughes : (smiles) That's nice. [Tom and Mrs Hughes's smiles are swallowed in Carson's presence.] Anna : I hope you and Lady Sybil are well. Tom : We are, thank you. And we've been following the story of Mr Bates. Mary keeps us informed. [Mrs Hughes and Anna smile, but Carson stiffens further at Tom's informality.] Tom : Still, I mustn't interrupt your dinner. [Tom begins to leave in the silence. Mrs Hughes offers an olive branch.] Mrs Hughes : Thank you for coming down. [Mrs Hughes and Tom share a friendly smile, and Carson exchanges disapproving looks as Tom leaves. The servants sit back down.] O'Brien : He's settled into his new life. Mr Carson : "Mary keeps us informed"? Mrs Hughes : Well, he knows her now. Mr Carson : What's that got to do with it? His Lordship would never call her Mary when talking to me. Never. If he wants to play their game, he better learn their rules. [Mrs Hughes shoots Carson another disapproving look.] Violet : Tomorrow, let's ask the servants to come up and dine with us. It'll make things easier. (chuckle) Mary : You must get him to stop calling Granny "milady." And Mama. Isobel : We need something that doesn't sound too stiff and grand. Robert : Lady Grantham, of course. And he can call me Lord Grantham. Sybil : That doesn't sound stiff or grand at all. [Mary catches Sybil's look.] Mary  (softly): One step at a time. [Sybil smiles. Mary walks to Matthew who's on the sofa.] Mary : So, what did the lawyer want? I presume he turned up. Matthew : He did...and it's rather complicated. But you were right, it was about Reggie's will. Mary : So, he's left you something? Matthew : Never mind that now. Just sit down and tell me about the relations that are coming for the wedding. I want to unscramble them in my head. Mrs Patmore : Go to bed when you're done. Daisy : I'll go to bed when I'm ready. [Mrs Patmore looks up.] Mrs Patmore : What's happened to you? Have you swapped places with your evil twin? Daisy : I'd like to know where the new kitchen maid is. That's what you promised. They've got a new footman, where's the kitchen maid? Mrs Patmore : I know and I'm sorry, but I spoke to Mr Carson tonight and they won't be taking anyone new on. Daisy : Except a footman. Mrs Patmore : I don't know how Mr Carson managed it, because His Lordship's put his foot down. But you're called my assistant now, and you've seven shillings extra every month. Daisy : You've still kept me here with a dishonest representation. Mrs Patmore : Oh, dear! Have you swallowed a dictionary? [Mrs Patmore walks out in a huff.] Sybil : Somehow none of it seems to matter when we're in Dublin. Class and all that just seems to fade away. I'm Mrs Branson and we get on with our lives like millions of others. [Mary nods in understanding.] Sybil : But here, he feels so patronised, and he hates it. Mary : But you don't regret it? Sybil : No, never. [They both smile.] Sybil : He's a wonderful, wonderful man. [Mary gives Sybil an affectionate touch.] Sybil : I just wish you knew him. Mary : Darling, we will know him. We'll know him and value him. I promise. Sybil : (smiles) Anyway...I best go upstairs [They rise from the couch.] Sybil : Make sure he's not too suicidal. Goodnight. [They kiss goodnight.] Mary : Oh, by the way, I don't know if Mama's told you, but the whole Grey family's coming tomorrow night. [Mary's mouth twitches. Sybil exhales in amusement.] Sybil : Including Larry? [Mary nods with an amused smile.] Sybil : Crikey. [Sybil laughs.] Mary : You'd better warn Tom. [Sybil turns to go.] Mary : Oh, and Sybil, if I were you, I wouldn't tell Papa about being Mrs Branson. [They chuckle slightly and Sybil agrees with a shake of her head. She leaves and Mary takes a sip of tea.] Tom : But who are the Greys? And why does it matter that they're coming? [Sybil takes off her robe.] Sybil : The father, Lord Merton, is Mary's godfather, but Larry Grey used to be keen on me when we were young. Tom : Were you keen on him. Sybil : No, I don't think so. I can hardly remember, to be honest. [Sybil gets into bed and Tom puts his arm around her.] Tom : So, what are you saying? Sybil : Well, nothing, particularly. But we could run into Ripon and find some tails. We have the money. Tom : I won't spend more of that money. Sybil : All right. [Sybil takes Tom's hand and he looks at it.] Sybil : Please don't talk about Ireland all the time. [He looks at her.] Sybil : I just want to make things easier for you. Tom : For me or for you? Don't disappoint me, Sybil. Not now that we're here. [They regard each other for a moment, and then he leans down and they kiss. He kisses her forehead and they cuddle.] Mary : Shall I order the car? Matthew : I don't think I can refuse a lift with Mother and then make the poor man go out again. [Matthew sits down.] Matthew : I'll walk. Mary : It might rain. Matthew : Then I'll get wet. [Mary chuckles and they smile at one another from across the room. Matthew holds out his hand to her.] Matthew : Now come and kiss me. [Mary takes a couple of steps towards him, then stops and folds her hands in front of her.] Mary : So, if they can't find Mr...Pillbox... [Matthew drops his hand and closes his eyes with a smile and a turn of his head.] Mary : What will you do with the money? Matthew : Pulbrook, and...they will find him. [Mary nods.] Mary : But if they don't. Matthew : Then...I'll decide what to do. Or we will. [Mary nods. Matthew thinks about it.] Matthew : Because I can't keep it. Mary : No. Of course not. [Matthew takes a casual sip of his drink and Mary stands there, somewhat stiffly.] Cora : Why were you so heavily invested in one enterprise? Wasn't it foolish? Has some of my fortune been lost? Robert : Some...? [Robert shakes his head.] Robert : All. Or almost all. [Cora looks at Robert with pitying shock. Robert begins to cry. He leans forward on his hands and elbows.] Cora  (whisper): Oh, my dear. [Cora watches him cry with pity and then crouches to her knees to comfort him.] Cora  (whisper): How terrible for you. Robert : It's not so good for you. [Cora laughs.] Cora : Don't worry about me, I'm an American. I have gun, will travel. [Robert looks at her with encouragement.] Robert : Oh, thank God for you. [Robert kisses her hand.] Robert : Anyway. [He kisses her hand again, giving in to a few more tears before looking up.] Cora : You know what? [Cora looks up at him with a smile.] Cora : I'm glad we have a wedding to celebrate. Let's make sure it's a great day. If it's to be our last, let's make it a wonderful last. And enjoy our lovely home and the lovely people we spend our life among. [Cora and Robert embrace.] Matthew : A bit early for drowning your sorrows. Tom : I thought it might be better if I moved down to the pub. Matthew : You're not serious? Tom : I can't go through too many more dinners like last night. Matthew : You don't make it easy for them. You really think you can recruit Cousin Robert for Sinn Féin? [Tom chuckles with a shake of his head.] Tom : I don't know what gets into me. I can see them staring and I know they don't want me here. Matthew : Well, don't include me. Or Mary. Tom : She wasn't too keen on the idea of a chauffeur for a brother-in-law. Matthew : Forget that, she's a...pragmatist. [Matthew rolls his eyes.] TOM (nods) 
She could be a tough fighter, too. Matthew : Well, let's hope she's not tested. Now, forget this, and walk back. We're brothers-in-law with high-minded wives. We better stick together. [Tom grins as they walk off together.] Bates : It's all there. Friends - though there weren't too many - tradesmen, acquaintances. But I can't see what you'll get out of them. Anna : I do not believe, when Vera decided to kill herself, she never mentioned it to another living soul. Bates : We know she left no note. I wish to God she had. But why are you sure it was suicide and not murder? Anna : Well, I know you didn't kill her. Then what's the alternative? A thief broke in, cooked an arsenic pie and forced her to eat it? It's not a very likely scenario. Bates : You can see why they convicted me. Anna : I'm going to write to everyone in the book, in case she said or, please God, wrote anything that could suggest a desire to die. Bates : But how long will it take? Anna : Why? Are you going somewhere? [Anna gives Bates a small, playful smile. He smiles back.] Alfred : Should have gone into cooking. I used to watch them in the kitchens and I could pick it up in a [?]. Daisy : Why didn't you then? O'Brien : Oh, it's a hard ladder for a man. For every Escoffier monsieur [?], there's a thousand dogsbodies taking orders from a cross and red faced old woman. [Alfred chuckles. Mrs Patmore appears behind them.] Mrs Patmore : Er, who's this you're discussing? O'Brien : Hello, Mrs Patmore. I didn't see you standing there. Mrs Patmore : Obviously not. [Alfred smiles in amusement. Daisy and Mrs Patmore clear away the dishes from the table.] Alfred : Mum and Aunt Sarah thought I'd be better off as a butler? And so that's what I'm trying for. Daisy : I think you're right. I know I'd rather be giving the orders. [Daisy walks off with the tray.] Mrs Patmore : To a cross and red faced old woman. Yes, we know. [Mrs Patmore follows her out with another tray. Alfred pours O'Brien another cup of tea and she smiles at him.] Anna : There. Is that what you meant? Edith : Yes. Perfect. Slightly new, but not too different. We'll see if Sir Anthony notices. [Anna chuckles with a smile.] Edith : I know they all think he's too old for me, but he's not. Bates is older than you and you are as happy as lovebirds. Anna : Our situation is hardly ideal, but... Yes. We're very happy together. Edith : Which is all that matters. [Edith checks her appearance in the mirror.] Edith : As I keep telling them. Thomas : I've no time to talk. O'Brien : His Lordship's not come up yet. [Thomas stops and turns to face her.] Thomas : Well? What is it? O'Brien : I was hoping you could help young Alfred to find his way about. Thomas : As a footman, you mean? O'Brien : As a valet. [Thomas raises his eyebrows and turns away. O'Brien follows.] O'Brien : He's looking after Mr Branson now. Though, I daresay, a chauffeur can dress himself. [Thomas stops to listen.] O'Brien : But you could tell him what he needs to know, give him an advantage. Thomas : Why? What's the rush? O'Brien : You've heard Mr Matthew has turned down Mr Molesley. Thomas : Blimey, you don't want much, do you? Can you remember what I had to go through to be a valet? O'Brien : (chuckles) Of course, I watched it, didn't I? Thomas : But young Alfred is to make the great leap in one bound? Well, I'm sorry, Miss O'Brien, but I'm not convinced, if you'll excuse me. [O'Brien is unhappy with his response as he enters Robert's dressing room.] 
 
 Matthew : It's infuriating. There's nothing he can do. Mary : I don't agree. I think it's feeble. He should will himself not to be ill and then collapse the next day. [Matthew sighs and gives Mary an amused look at her unreasonableness. She smiles at her own humour.] Mary : Whom will you ask instead? Matthew : I'm not sure. [Larry Grey speaks with Tom Branson in another part of the room.] Larry Grey : I've known Sybil all my life. So you can imagine how curious I was when I found out you'd be here tonight. I never thought we'd meet in person. Tom : As opposed to what? In spirit? [Larry considers the comment, then straightens up pompously.] Larry Grey : Well, you see, to us, in marrying you, it seemed like Sybil had left Downton Abbey forever. If you...know what I mean. [Larry gives an arrogant chuckle.] Tom : I know exactly what you mean. [Larry nods.] Larry Grey : Did they lose your suitcase on the way over? How maddening for you. Tom : No, my suitcase arrived safely, thank you. [Tom puts down his drink.] Tom : Along with my manners. [Tom walks away angrily. Violet sees him as she and Isobel enter.] Violet : He's still dressed as the man from the prudential, I see. [Violet takes a deep breath.] Isobel : Yes, it's nice to have someone from the real world, isn't it? [Isobel walks off and Violet purses her lips. Robert walks over to her.] Robert : Hello, Mamma. Can I tempt you to one of these new cocktails? Violet : No, no, I don't think so. They look too exciting for so early in the evening, don't you think so, Carson? Mr Carson : Better avoided, my lady. Violet : I don't think so. [Violet waves away the tray of drinks. Edith joins Isobel and Sir Anthony in another part of the room.] Isobel : What a pleasure it is to see you out and about, Sir Anthony. Sir Anthony : I want to say, "Can I be of any help?" but you don't seem to need any. Edith : He doesn't need help at all, do you? He won't let me do anything. Sir Anthony : Mustn't be a nuisance, you know? Isobel : Are you coming to the wedding? [Sir Anthony opens his mouth to answer, but Edith answers immediately.] Edith : Of course. Sir Anthony : Well...if you really want me. Edith : I do. I really do. [Edith smiles at him and he smiles back.] Sir Anthony : You look very nice. Have you done something jolly with your hair? [Edith's mouth opens in pleased surprise. Sir Anthony sees something behind her.] Sir Anthony : I say, what the devil? Edith : What is it? [Edith and Isobel turn to see Larry turning away from a small table.] Mr Carson : Dinner is served, Your Ladyship. Daisy : How's it going? Alfred : Awkward. Mr Branson's well aware Lady Sybil doesn't like it much. [Alfred picks up the next dinner tray.] Alfred : I don't understand it. He's only had one cocktail. Daisy : Maybe he was drinking before he came down to calm his nerves. [Alfred sighs with a shake of his head and exits with the tray. Daisy and Mrs Patmore make significant looks.] Tom : No, I don't agree! And I don't care who knows it! [Sybil puts down her silverware, upset by Tom's behaviour.] Tom : Or that the Black and Tans are there to restore order, are they? Well, why don't they just murder the entire population, and then you wouldn't hear a squeak out of any of them!? [Mary is also tense from Tom's awkward shouting.] Violet : Is there any way to shut him up? Robert : If I knew how to control him, he wouldn't be here in the first place. Cora : Are you interested in Irish politics, Lord Merton? Lord Merton : Well, I was only just saying that I thought-- Tom : He's interested in Irish repression! Like all of you. [Larry smiles, trying to hold in his laughter.] Matthew : Look, old chap, of course this stuff matters a great deal to you. Tom : Yes, it does matter. This stuff. [Mary looks over and sees Larry holding in another smile.] Tom : It matters a very great deal. Mary : What's so funny? Larry Grey : Nothing, I'm just enjoying this vivid display of Irish character. [Sir Anthony looks at Larry sharply.] Sybil : Please, Tom, we don't need to wear everyone out. Tom : Why? What's the matter? Am I not being polite enough? [Tom tosses his napkin on the table.] Sir Anthony : Well, wait a minute. This was down to you, wasn't it? [Larry furrows his eyebrows in confusion.] Larry Grey : I don't know what you mean. Sir Anthony : Yes, you do. I saw you. You put something in his drink, didn't you? Just before we came in. [Everyone looks at Larry.] Sybil : That's not true, is it, Larry? Edith : What a beastly thing to do. Larry Grey : Oh, come on, Edith. That's not like you. You could always take a joke. [Edith stares in surprise.] Mary : A bully's defence. [Larry turns to Mary and his smile drops.] Mary : Listen everyone, Mr Grey has given my brother-in-law something to make him appear drunk. Violet : Could it be drink? Mary : No, not drink. Some horrible pill. Sybil, take him upstairs. Robert : Il ne manque ça. [Sybil and Isobel fuss over helping Tom.] Cora : Tom has been the victim of a cruel prank, which I know you will all be kind enough to forget. Violet : Forgive, perhaps. Forget, never. Lord Merton : Is this true, Larry? Larry Grey : I don't know why you're getting so hot under the collar. He's only a grubby little chauffeur chap-- [Lord Merton, Matthew, and Robert all bolt out of their chairs in indignation.] Lord Merton : Be silent this instant, sir! [Larry stares wide-eyed at his father. Lord Merton turns calmly to Tom, who's slightly hunched over on the serving table with Sybil's support.] Lord Merton : I apologize for my son, Mr Branson. Unreservedly. I only hope you'll recover before the wedding. [Tom nods.] Matthew : I hope so, too. [Matthew steps over to Tom.] Matthew : Since I want him to be my best man. [Matthew claps Tom on the shoulder. Robert looks at Matthew in surprise as he's about to sit down, and Carson and Isobel's jaws drop. Isobel shortly recovers.] Isobel : Bravo! Well said! [Tom stares at Matthew and Sybil smiles.] Sybil : Do you really mean it? [Tom stares at Matthew with bright hopefulness in his eyes.] Tom : Honestly? Matthew : I've told you before, if we're mad enough to take on the Crawley girls, we have to stick together. [Mary beams happily.] Mary : Oh! Thank you, Matthew. Thank you so much. [Matthew smiles and Tom pats him on the arm as he hunches toward the door.] Edith : That was rather marvellous of you...to expose Larry Grey like that. You saved the day, really. Sir Anthony : Oh, I wouldn't say that. Matthew saved the day. Edith : No, it was you. [Sir Anthony smiles modestly.] Edith : I do hope we'll be seeing a bit more of you once the wedding's over. Sir Anthony : Well, er... Edith : Wouldn't you like that? Sir Anthony : Oh, I should like that very much. Much more than I probably ought to. [Edith smiles.] Robert : Edith, let Sir Anthony go. [Robert calls to her from the doorway as another pair of guests leave. Sir Anthony turns around to look at Robert. Edith takes the opportunity to lean in and kiss his cheek. He smiles a bit, then puts on his hat and watches at her as she returns to the house.] Edith : Goodnight, Papa. [Sir Anthony's car drives away and Robert enters the house.] Robert : Well, that's the last of them. Where are the others? Cora : They've gone to bed. Robert : So has Edith. And so should we. [Robert goes for a nightcap.] Robert : Golly. What a night for the county to feed off. Cora : But it was good of Matthew to show solidarity. Robert : I suppose so. We're going to need all the solidarity we can muster. [Robert takes a sip.] Cora : When will you tell the girls ? Robert : I think I should tell Mary now. Cora : No, not before the wedding, surely. Robert : I must. They're disagreeing about where they should live, so it'd be wrong for me to keep it from them. Then they can discuss it on the honeymoon and decide more sensibly. Do you think we should say something to your mother when she gets here? Cora : No. She'll go into state mourning and cast a pall over the whole proceedings. Robert : (chuckles) Thank God she missed tonight's drama or we'd never hear the end of it. Cora : Don't worry. She'll bring enough drama of her own. [Cora chuckles.] Robert : Mm. [Robert takes a drink.] Craig : Won't work, you know? And if you don't admit your guilt, they won't let you go when the time comes. Bates : How can I admit what isn't true? Craig : Why do you have to be so pious? [Bates shifts his head, but doesn't respond.] Craig : You're a touchy fellow, aren't you? Bates : Don't push me, Craig. Craig : Is that a warning? Bates : Yes. Yes, it is. [Bates glares over his shoulder.] Bates : I'm warning you. [Craig stares at Bates and Bates turns back to his desk.] Edith : I'm not sure about the hat. Is it supposed to look crooked? Sybil : Don't listen to her. I love it. You're not to change a thing. Mary : Anna? Anna : I think you look lovely, milady. [Mary smiles. There's a knock at the door and the ladies turn around.] Sybil : Stop. Wait. Who is it? [The door stops opening.] Robert : Your longsuffering papa. Mary : I suppose he can come in. [Robert enters and Mary holds out her hands for his opinion.] Robert : What's this for? Mary : Going away. [Mary twists so he can see the back.] Mary : How does it look? Robert : Expensive. [Edith smiles.] Mary : Twice the national debt, I'm afraid. [Robert chuckles.] Mary : But I know you don't mind. [Mary cringes hopefully/apologetically.] Robert : Can I have one moment alone to give Mary my blessing? Sybil : That's lovely. Shoo, everyone. [The other girls leave and Mary takes off her hat, then turns back to her father.] Mary : Go on. Bless me. [Mary raises her eyes to the heavens playfully.] Robert : Of course. [Robert steps forward.] Robert : But there's something I feel I ought to tell you first. I wanted to wait until you got back, but I don't believe I can. Mary : That sounds rather ominous. Tom : Hello, Mr Molesley. I got a message to call on Mrs Crawley. Mr Molesley : Very good, sir. [Molesley bows. Tom walks toward the living room, but Molesley speaks up.] Mr Molesley : If you'd like to... [Molesley nods to Tom's hat.] Mr Molesley : ...give me your hat and coat, sir. Violet : Are you going up to the house...to welcome the Queen of Sheeba? Isobel : Oh, I think so. Are you? Violet : No. I'll pay homage at dinner. Isobel : I've always admired the way Mrs Levinson is never overawed by the whole set up at Downton. Violet : Was Napoleon overawed by the Bourbons? [The door opens and Mr Molesley enters with Tom.] Violet : Oh. [They turn to face Tom.] Isobel : Come in, Tom. May I call you Tom? Tom : Of course. Good afternoon, milady. That is, Lady Grantham. I'm glad to find you here because...I want to apologize for last night. [Violet holds out a hand with a shake of her head, dismissing his apoloogy.] Isobel : Oh, there's no need. We know it was not your fault. Violet : You weren't the first drunk in that dining room, I can assure you. [Isobel chuckles and Tom smiles.] Tom : Only the first republican. Violet : Well, you've got me there. TOM (to Isobel) 
Why was it you wanted to see me? Isobel : We've asked Molesley to look out Matthew's old morning coat. He's confident he can make it fit. Tom : That's very kind, ladies, but you see, I don't approve of the costumes. I see them as the uniform of oppression, and I should be uncomfortable wearing them. Violet : Are you quite finished? [Tom looks at Violet, his polite pride fading to curiosity.] Tom : I have. Violet : Good. Please take off your coat. [Tom looks at Isobel for help, his mouth open in surprise, but her expression doesn't change.] Violet : Molesley, do help him. [Molesley steps up to Tom.] Mr Molesley : If you'll just slip it off, sir. [Tom gives up with a sigh and unbuttons his coat, clearing his throat. Molesley helps him out of it and picks up the morning coat.] Violet : Shouldn't he put the waistcoat on first? [Molesley helps Tom into the morning coat as Matthew enters.] Matthew : What's going on? Tom : They're forcing me into a morning coat. Matthew : He has no say in it? Violet : No, he doesn't, and nor do you. [Matthew raises an eyebrow and he and Tom look at each other. Molesley finishes adjusting the morning coat.] Violet : Well, what do you think, Molesley? Mr Molesley : It'll need lifting a little hem, milady. Violet : Mm-hmm. Mr Molesley : We'll move the buttons so. Violet : Well, I think the shoulders [Molesley inspects the shoulders with tilts of his head.] Mrs Levinson : Come war and peace, Downton still stands and the Crawleys are still in it. Cora. [Mrs. Levinson steps forward to hug her daughter.] Cora : Mother, how lovely to see you. Mrs Levinson : As long as it is. Robert, aren't you going to kiss me? [Cora steps back and Robert steps forward.] Robert : With the greatest enthusiasm. [Robert gives Mrs Levinson a kiss on the cheek. Robert looks at the red motorcar.] Robert : Tell me, where does this come from? Mrs Levinson : I hired it in Liverpool. Why? Robert : Well, I thought it might be a gift from the U.S. government to help get Britain back on its feet. [Mrs Hughes, Mr Carson, and Mrs Levinson chuckle. Mrs Levinson steps up to them.] Mrs Levinson : Carson and Mrs Hughes, the world has moved on since last we met. Mr Carson : And we have moved on with it, my lady. Mrs Levinson : Really? (chuckle) It seems so strange to think of the English embracing change. Mrs Hughes, this is my maid, Reed. [Reed and Mrs Hughes nod to each other, and Reed takes her place in the servant's line. Mrs Levinson turns to her grandchildren.] Mrs Levinson : Sybil, tell me all about the arrangements for the birth. [Mrs Levinson embraces Sybil lightly and receives a kiss.] Mrs Levinson : We do these things so much better in the States. [Mrs Levinson turns to the next girl.] Mrs Levinson : Edith, still no one special? [Edith smiles with a sigh and a shrug.] Mrs Levinson : Well, never mind. You must take a tip from the modern American girl. [Mrs Levinson proceeds to Mary.] Mrs Levinson : Ah, Mary. Dearest Mary. [Mrs Levinson lightly embraces Mary to receive a kiss.] Mrs Levinson : Now. You tell me all of your wedding plans and I'll see what I can do to improve them. [Mrs Levinson walks into the house. The family all exchange looks, recovering from the whirlwind American mother-in-law. Cora and Robert enter the house, the others following in order of rank.] O'Brien : What's the matter with you? [Reed enters.] Daisy : Mrs Patmore knows. Reed : Should I tell you Mrs Levinson's requirements during her stay? Daisy : No, tell her. Mrs Patmore : Er, yes. Miss Reed, how can I help? Reed : Well, to start with, I will need goat's milk in the mornings. Mrs Patmore : Goat's milk? Oh, fancy that. Reed : She drinks only boiled water. Mrs Patmore : Really? Reed : In England, that is. Anna : Shouldn't Daisy be doing this? Alfred : I ought to take the tea up. Mrs Patmore : Oh, I'll have it ready in a moment. [Mrs Patmore walks toward the kitchens. Daisy wathes with pursed lips, her arms still crossed.] Reed : No fats, no crab, and nothing from the marrow family. [Mrs Patmore walks out with Reed and Daisy's stiff demeanor fades into uncertainty.] Mrs Levinson : Do explain again how exactly you are related to all of us, Mr Crawley. [Matthew sighs with some amusement.] Matthew : Rather distantly, I'm afraid. [Tom places his hand over Sybil's affectionately and she smiles back at him.] Matthew : My great, great grandfather was a younger son of the third earl. [Isobel chuckles.] Mrs Levinson : My. Hm, I'm going to have to write that down so I can study it. Robert : Look at our page in Burke's. You'll find Matthew there. Mrs Levinson : Good, because I would so like to understand why he gets to inherit my late husband's money. Matthew : (chuckle) I know, it's funny isn't it? [Cora and Mary chuckle.] Mrs Levinson : Not everyone shares your sense of humour. Isobel : But surely it doesn't matter now that they're getting married. [Mrs Levinson tips her head up in acknowledgement.] Mary : In fact, we'd better turn him out, or it'll be bad luck for tomorrow. Cora : Quite right. [Matthew looks at his watch and stands. The gentlemen stand as Cora and Mary exit with him.] Mrs Levinson : You must be the chauffeur I've heard so much about. Tom : I am, ma'am. Sybil : Tom's a journalist now, Grandmamma. Mrs Levinson : Oh, well, well. I've heard of those journeys on my side of the water. It's very pleasant to hear of them happening here. [Robert looks less than pleased, but Tom and Sybil smile.] Mary : It's all right, Mamma. You can leave us unchaperoned. After tomorrow, all things are permitted. [Cora chuckles with a blush.] Cora : Don't embarrass me. Bye Matthew. [She squeezes his arm on her way out.] Cora : Get a good night's sleep. [Mary and Matthew look around the hall.] Mary : How many moments of Crawley history has this room seen? Matthew : And many more to come. [Mary tenses.] Mary : I hope so. In fact, what happened in the search for...Mr Pumpkin... [Matthew looks down with an amused smile.] Mary : ...Swire's heir? Have you heard anything? Matthew : Yes. Charkham sent a telegram. I've got it here, actually. Mary : Oh. [Matthew hands her the telegram and she reads it.] Mary : "Convincing proof of Pulbrook's death. Stop. Investigating date." W--what does that mean? Matthew : Well, if Pulbrook died after Reggie, then his heirs get the money, but if he died first, then I do. [Mary's brow furrows.] Mary : But that's absurd. What right have his heirs to inherit anything? Matthew : Well, darling, what right have I? And frankly, what difference does it make? I shan't keep it if I get it. Mary : Well...actually, you will. [Matthew's brows furrow.] Mary : Because something rather terrible has happened. [Matthew steps toward her with curiosity.] Mary : You see...apparently Papa has lost a great deal of money. [Matthew looks suddenly toward the library and back at Mary.] Mary : Enough to ruin him. Enough for us to lose Downton. Matthew : Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Mary : Yes, but...surely, if Mr Pulbrook did die before Swire, then...we're saved. [Matthew's expression darkens.] Matthew : Darling, I don't think you understand. [Matthew steps away.] Matthew : Reggie Swire will have got me in his will because he believed I was his daughter's one true love. Mary : So you were. [Matthew jerks violently.] Matthew : Yes, but... [Matthew walks slowly back to Mary.] Matthew : But I broke Lavinia's heart and she died. He never knew that. [Mary stares at Matthew, mouth open, brows furrowed.] Matthew : How could I possibly allow myself to...profit from her death. To--to...dine in splendour, because I took away a woman's will to live. Mary : So, you're prepared to destroy us in payment for your destroying her? Matthew : Darling, please. You know I would do anything for this family. Mary : Anything except help us. [Matthew's expression darkens again. Mary becomes increasingly upset.] Mary : Except save Papa from living out the rest of his days in humiliation and grief. And what about us? What about our children? Oh, God, Matthew, how can you be so disappointing? [Mary breaks down in tears.] Matthew : Mary, please. Mary : No! [Mary backs away from Matthew's comfort.] Mary : Don't you see what this means? Don't you see what a difference this makes? It means that you're not on our side, Matthew. It means that deep down, you're not on our side! [Mary tosses the telegram angrily and runs upstairs in tears. Matthew puts a hand over his eyes for a moment, then he sees Edith on the stairs, witnessing the end of their argument. Matthew sighs.] Anna : How are you getting on with your new companion? Bates : I don't like him, but so far I've kept it to myself. So...who are the bridesmaids? [Anna smiles.] Anna : You don't care about all that. Bates : You're wrong. It's the stuff of my dreams. [Bates smiles.] Bates : The panic that a dinner won't be ready, or a frock isn't ironed, or a gun wasn't cleaned. [Anna sighs with a smile.] Bates : Do you know where you're going for the honeymoon? Anna : Oh, I want to talk about that. They'll stay in London with Lady Rosamund for a couple of days just to get used to each other. [Anna lets out a small chuckle and they both smile at each other.] Anna : And then they go to the south of France. I'll hire a replacement in London, and then I'll come home instead. Lady Mary won't mind. I'll pay. Bates : Why would you do that? Anna : Well, to be near you, of course. Bates : Don't you understand? While I'm in here, you have to live my life as well as your own. Go to France, see some sights. Get us some memories. Anna : But I wouldn't be home for a month. Bates : But we'd have something to talk about. Go. I insist. [Anna studies Bates.] Bates : For my sake. [Anna considers his request.] Violet : I was so afraid I was going to be late. But th-- Ah-ha-ha. [Violet sees Mrs Levinson and they greet one another.] Mrs Levinson : Violet. [Violet opens her arms and embraces Violet, who stands there accepting it awkwardly. Mrs Levinson steps back with a smile, then looks at Violet's face.] Mrs Levinson : Oh, dear. [Violet's smile is frozen.] Mrs Levinson : I'm afraid the war has made old women of us both. [Carson raises his eyebrows and exits.] Violet : Oh, I wouldn't say that. But then, I always keep out of the sun. How do you find Downton on your return? Mrs Levinson : Much the same, really. Probably too much the same, but then I don't want to cast a pall over all the happiness. Violet : How could you ever do that? [They start walking toward the drawing room.] Mrs Levinson : Tell me, what do you think of young Lochinvar who has so ably carried off our granddaughter and our money? Violet : Oh. Mrs Levinson : Do you approve of him? Violet : Not as much as you will, when you get to know him. Mrs Levinson : Hmm. Has he gone home to change? Violet : Oh, no. We won't see him again tonight. The groom never sees the bride the night before the wedding. Mrs Levinson : Ha. Nothing ever alters for you people, does it? Revolutions erupt and monarchies crash to the ground, and the groom still cannot see the bride before the wedding. Violet : You Americans never understand the importance of tradition. Mrs Levinson : Yes, we do. We just don't give it power over us. History and tradition took Europe into a world war. Maybe you should think about letting go of its hand. [Mrs Levinson pats Violet's arms and walks off. Edith enters to find Violet staring after Cora's mother.] Edith : There you are. I see you've said hello to Grandmamma. Violet  (whisper): She is like a homing pigeon. She finds our underbelly every time. Dreadful woman. [Violet walks to the drawing room.] Robert : No, it wasn't me. (to Mrs Levinson) Someone sent Sybil and Tom the price for the tickets to come over. [Mary is silent and tense from her fight with Matthew.] Sybil : Does it matter who it was? It meant we could be at the wedding. Of course, I wish it had been you, Papa, but I don't mind. I thank them, whoever they are. Cora : Well, I'm very glad you're here, but it wasn't me either, I'm sad to say. Mrs Levinson : Well, I love a mystery. Who could it be? Robert : My guess is Cousin Isobel. She always likes to stick her oar in. Sybil : I'm going to ask her. Violet : For heaven's sake, it was me. [Robert looks up in shock, putting down his spoon. Even Mary is shocked out of her nervous state, and Tom looks up in surprise.] Sybil : You? But it wasn't your writing. Violet : No. Smithers did it. Like all ladies' maids, she lives for intrigue. Tom : You wanted me to come here? Violet : I wanted Sybil and her husband to be here for Mary's wedding, yes. [Carson drops Tom's napkin on him with a grimace, for Tom to put in his lap.] Sybil : Why keep that secret? Violet : Silly, wasn't it? [Mary stares at the table, her brows furrowed.] Tom : I'm very touched. I'll admit it. Mrs Levinson : How democratic. Makes me think maybe I've been mistaken in you. Violet : I am a woman of many parts. After all, Branson is a me-- I mean, Tom. Ha. You're a member of the family now. [The corner of Tom's mouth turns up into a smile.] Violet : You'll find we Crawleys stick together. Mary : Not always. [Mary mopes.] Cora : Mary, what is it? Mary : Oh, nothing. It's just... [Mary can't hold it in. She leaves the table in tears. Tom and Robert stand and Violet reaches her hand out to Mary's retreating figure.] Violet : Oh, Mary, dear... Mrs Patmore : Oh, there you are. That's all for this course. [Mrs Patmore places a gravy boat on Alfred's serving tray.] Mrs Patmore : Don't you think, Daisy?! [Mrs Patmore shouts down the table where Daisy is sitting with pursed lips and arms crossed.] Alfred : Is Daisy all right, Mrs Patmore? Mrs Patmore : Oh, yes. She's been such a big help. Now, I think we should check the pudding, Daisy. Don't you agree?! [Daisy doesn't move.] Cora : It's nerves. Everyone cries at some point before their wedding. Mrs Levinson : But what was the quarrel about? Edith : I'm not sure. I know she accused him of not being on our side. Violet : Oh, well, I hope she's wrong. That could be rather serious. Robert : Of course he's on our side. It's ridiculous. I'll go and see him. Tom : No, I'll go. [Robert looks at Tom in unpleasant surprise.] Tom : I'm his best man. I should be the one to go. Robert : What? Tom : I know what it is to marry into this family. I'm not comparing myself to Mr Crawley, but he is another kind of outsider. Robert : Well, I hardly-- Mrs Levinson : Well, why not? He's the one that will lose his job if the wedding's cancelled. [Robert and Tom regard each other for a moment, then they leave the subject.] Daisy : I see what you're doing, you know. Mrs Patmore : What's that then? Daisy : Not responding to my protest. Mrs Patmore : Oh, "Not responding to my protest". Very elegant, I must say. [Mrs Patmore turns to Daisy with a hand on her hip.] Mrs Patmore : Who've you been talking to? Thomas? [Daisy is caught with no response.] Daisy : Well... [Mrs Patmore tilts her head, waiting for an answer.] Daisy : Oh, just give me the cloth and I'll dry. [Mrs Patmore tosses Daisy the cloth in victory.] Anna : But suppose he never gets the money. Mary : It's not about the money. It's that he won't save Papa when he could. Anna : But he has to be true to himself. Mary : Well, that's the point. He puts himself above the rest of us. Don't you see? Anna : What I see is a good man, milady. [Mary looks up at Anna in the mirror, listening wholeheartedly.] Anna : And they're not like buses. There won't be another one along in ten minutes time. [Anna puts the hair brush down and goes about her business while Mary thinks over what she said.] Tom : It seems big, but it's not big. Matthew : And if it happens? I get the money? I can't do what she wants. Tom : It's strange for me to be arguing about inherited money and saving estates when the old me would like to put a bomb under the lot of you. [Tom and Matthew both smile in amusement.] Matthew : But? Tom : But you're meant to be together. [Matthew smiles a little.] Tom : I've known that as long as I've been at the house. And at first this kept you apart, and then that kept you apart... [Matthew looks upwards, remembering.] Tom : But please don't risk it a third time. Because I'll tell you this: you won't be happy with anyone else while Lady Mary walks the earth. [Matthew closes his eyes at Tom's social faux pas.] Matthew : Call her Mary, please. Tom : Never mind what I call her. I know what I'll call you if you let this chance slip through your fingers. [Matthew chuckles and smiles at Tom.] Matthew : I just need a word. [Mary stands up at Matthew's voice.] Mary : No. Go away. I'm undressed, you can't come in. Matthew : One word. Come to the door. Tom : Please. Just give him this chance. [Mary walks toward the door at the sound of Tom's voice.] Matthew : I won't look at you. Anna : It'd be unlucky if you did. Mary : Only if we were getting married. Matthew : Which we are. [Anna looks at Mary and asks with a tilt of her head. Mary nods that she'll talk with Matthew and Anna leaves with a smile. Matthew looks back and Tom, who gives him an encouraging smile, and Tom and Anna both disappear.] Matthew : My darling, I refuse to quarrel about something that hasn't happened and probably never will. Mary : That's what Anna says. Matthew : And she's right. My darling, I'm sure we will fight about...money...and about Downton...about how to rear our children, about any number of other things. Mary : Then shouldn't we accept it? Matthew...I've been thinking...and I'm not angry now. Truly, I'm not. But if we can disagree over something as fundamental as this, then...shouldn't we be brave and back away now? Matthew : No. Mary : It's not because you're afraid of calling it off, because I'm not. Matthew : No... [Matthew takes a breath trying to form the words.] Matthew : It's because of something Tom said. [Mary's eyebrows furrow as she waits for his answer.] Matthew : That I would never be happy with anyone else as long as you walked the earth. Which is true. And...I think you feel the same about me. [Mary thinks about it and raises her eyebrows when she realises the truth.] Matthew : Can I kiss you? [Mary turns her head in surprise.] Matthew : 'Cause I need to. [Mary smiles.] Matthew : Very much. Mary : No. It's bad luck to look at me. Matthew : What about if I close my eyes and you do too. [Mary thinks about it for a moment.] Mary : All right. But you mustn't cheat. [Mary waits for Matthew to step around the open door. He steps inside with a smile and she feels her way forward with a hand on his chest. Her hand slides to his face and they kiss. When they pull apart, Mary opens her eyes. They both smile, though Matthew's eyes are still closed. Mary stands there with her hand on his chest and closes her eyes again.] Matthew : Goodnight. [They both smile again and Matthew steps backward out of her room. Mary opens her eyes and looks at the floor dreamily.] Tom : Right. I'm off to collect Matthew. Robert : You look very smart. Tom : I hope so. Because I'm extremely uncomfortable. [Tom chuckles with a smile as he fidget with his sleeve. He begins to head out again.] Robert : Branson. [Tom stops. Robert exhales.] Robert : That is...Tom. [Tom walks back toward Robert.] Robert : I want to thank you for what you did last night. I'm grateful. I mean it. Tom : We're both strong characters. I'd say we have plenty of slamming doors and shouting matches to come. [Robert is aghast for a moment, then he recovers himself with a sigh.] Robert : Forgive me, I was about to be indignant, but of course, you have a perfect right to speak as you do. Tom : I hope you mean that, too. Robert : I do. Now, hurry up. [They smile at each other and Tom exits.] Cora : You'd ask, wouldn't you, if there was anything you wanted me to tell you. I mean, I'm sure you know. Mary : More than you did. [Cora exhales.] Mary : And relax. There isn't anything I need to hear now. Cora : Because when two people love each other, you understand, everything... [Sybil raises her eyebrows, waiting for their mother's response.] Cora : Is the most terrific fun. [Sybil laughs.] Mary : Careful, Mamma, or you'll shock Anna. Anna : I'm a married woman now, milady. [The married ladies chuckle.] Edith : I think we should go. Sybil : What about Anna? How are you going to get to the church? Anna : They're waiting for me in the wagonette. I'll see you there. [Anna steps back and Mary turns around on her chair. Sybil kneels down in front of her.] Sybil : I know mine was a wild runaway marriage, darling, and yours is the one everyone wanted, but what's so thrilling is that this is every bit as romantic. Mary : Thank you. For always being so sweet. [They kiss each other on the cheek and Sybil stands back. Mary stands and Edith faces her.] Edith : Love and position in one handsome package. Who could ask for more? [Mary exhales and gives Cora a sidelong look as Edith leaves with Sybil. Mary faces Cora.] Cora : Never mind Edith. Well... [Cora steps up to Mary.] Cora : Very, very good luck my beautiful daughter. [Cora squeezes Mary's hands and leaves. Anna steps forward and unties the robe over Mary's wedding gown.] Mrs Hughes : Now, you've a great big motorcar all to yourselves. Just think of that. So we'll expect you to behave as if you were quite grown up. You can do that, can't you? [One of the flower girls runs over to O'Brien.] O'Brien : Have you got everything you need? FLOWER GIRL 
Yes. O'Brien : [?] then. Careful of your dress. [O'Brien opens the car door for the girl. The girls giggle as they sit together.] O'Brien : Settle down. Mrs Hughes : All right? [Alfred closes the car door on the other side and leans in the window.] Alfred : Don't do anything I wouldn't do. FLOWER GIRLS 
We won't. MRS HUGHES. 
Buh-bye. Alfred : [?] [The motorcar drives off. A large horse drawn carriage pulls up to the front door.] Mrs Hughes : Have you got everything you need? Mrs Patmore : We do. Now, be off with you and enjoy yourself. [Mrs Hughes leaves.] Daisy : I wish we were going. Mrs Patmore : And who would get the food ready for when they come back? But still, fetch your coat, and we'll see her off. [Daisy smiles and they exit.] Robert : Right. See you in a minute. [Sybil and Edith smile at Robert as they follow their mother out.] Sybil : And so should you. [Carson enters.] Mr Carson : They just leaving now, my lord, as soon as we've got Anna. Robert : Ah. [Anna calls down the stairs.] Anna : Here comes the bride. [Robert and Carson look up as Anna descends with a bouquet. Mary walks down, her veil flowing out behind her. Robert and Carson's jaws drop at the sight of her and step forward.] Mary : Will I do, Carson? [Mary smiles. Carson looks at her in awe with tears in his eyes.] Mr Carson : Very nicely, my lady. [Mary steps down to the hall and her father meets her.] Robert : Thank heavens you got everything settled. You had me worried. Mary : It's not quite settled, I'm afraid. He won't get off that easily. Robert : But you're happy? Mary : I am. [Robert nods.] Mary : And what about you? [Robert takes a breath before he speaks.] Robert : I'm so happy...so very happy, I feel my chest will explode. [Robert kisses Mary's cheek with tears in his eyes. He offers her his arm and they walk toward the front door together.] Edith : It's so lovely that you're here. Come behind us. Sir Anthony : I can't, I'm not family. Edith : Well, you almost are. [Anthony scoffs and allows Edith to lead him to his seat. Matthew and Tom arrive and hand their hats to a servant.] Matthew : Morning. Thank you. Tom : Thank you. [Matthew addresses Molesley in a back row.] Matthew : Molesley. [Molesley stands and O'Brien watches them.] Matthew : I'm very grateful to you for keeping Mr Branson up to the mark. We both are, aren't we? Tom : We certainly are. MOLESLEY 
Thank you, sir. [Tom and Matthew walk toward the altar and Molesley catches O'Brien's eye. He smiles at her, but she turns away. Mrs Hughes and Mr Carson sit in a pew together.] Mr Carson : This is a proud day, Mrs Hughes. Mrs Hughes : I don't know if I'm proud, but I'm very glad you're happy, Mr Carson. [Cora leans over to Edith.] Cora : You're next, darling, you'll see. Edith : Will I? [Cora smiles and takes Edith's hand. Cora and Mrs Levinson sit together.] Violet : It's so encouraging to see the future unfurl. [Mrs Levinson looks over at Violet coolly.] Mrs Levinson : As long as you remember it will bear no resemblance to the past. Tom : Good luck. [Tom and Matthew face the altar as Robert walks Mary down the aisle. Matthew peeks around his shoulder to see Mary smiling at him. He returns the smile. Robert leads Mary to the altar and steps back. Matthew leans over.] Matthew : You came. To be honest, I wasn't completely sure you would. Mary : I'm glad to hear it. I should hate to be predictable. [They begin to chuckle.]
