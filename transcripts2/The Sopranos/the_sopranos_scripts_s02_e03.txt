 Hey, janet jackson. 
  Hi, mr. Soprano. 
  Where's meadow? 
  I give up. 
  In the house? 
  Ny. 
  To billy, thanks for calling. 
  Sure, as soon as i found out it was your mom's place. 
  O. D. 
  His friend says special k and ecstasy. 
  You gotta be f*cking kidding me. 
  Nk. 
  Your kid's alright, she's a little dru in your grandmother's house? 
  It wasn't my fault. 
  If i had a quarter for every time i heard that since you learned how to talk, i'd have a private jet on 24- hour stand- by. 
  Get in the car. 
  In your grandmother's house. 
  Now, who's repeating themself? 
  You're just lu cky i knew that cop. 
  So he cut me a favor. 
  Let me guess, he owes you money? 
  Are you gonna tell me what she did? 
  Go upstairs. 
  No, i wanna se e the fight. 
  Anthony jr. , get your little ass up those stairs. 
  Meadow we can talk about it in the morning. 
  Get down here! 
  Let her go to bed. 
  Let her go to bed? 
  I want her to answer for herself! 
  She's drunk! 
  Was she driving like this? 
  I could have taken ecstasy but i didn't! 
  Don't puke on the floor! 
  What are you doing up? 
  Go to bed! 
  She fools around with ecstasy and you yell at me? 
  Get up there! 
  So, what did she h ave to say for herself? 
  The usual sh1t, "wasn't my fault. 
  " There was design er drugs there, tony. 
  So, what did you say? 
  I don't know, i yelled. 
  What the f*ck else am i gonna do? 
  You sure you're gonn a be alright, uncle rich? 
  I wanna walk. 
  See if i run into any of the old crowd. 
  Thanks, doll. 
  Er. 
  Motherfuck there has to be consequences. 
  What kind of parents would we be if we let her get away with this? 
  Typical. 
  Ip. 
  Plenty of parents still crack the wh yeah, that's what they tell you. 
  I cannot wait unti l she goes off to college. 
  Oh, right, so you can be f*cked up with the empty nest syndrome, and go on wellbutrin like your sister. 
  As a parent today, you are over a bar rel no matter what you do. 
  You take away the car, you become her chauffeurs. 
  You ground her, you gotta stay home weekends ds. 
  And be prison guar we could throw her out, but social services would bring her back, and then we'd be in front of the judge, she's not 18 yet. 
  That's your solution, to throw your daughter out? 
  All i'm saying, with the laws today, you can't even restrain your kid physically, 'cause she can sue you for child abuse. 
  There has to be consequences. 
  And, there will be, i hear you, okay? 
  Let's not over- play our hand. 
  'Cause if she finds out we're powerless, we're f*cked. 
  Jesus, mothe r of christ! 
  Richie, so, when'd you get out? 
  How come nobody told me? 
  Well, it's funny. 
  Paulie walnuts told me he ran into you this morning. 
  Hey, honest to f*cking god , nobody said a word. 
  Just shut the f*ck up. 
  I did a lot of meditation in the can on this. 
  You can't believe how clear you can see things. 
  Do you ever meditate? 
  Me, meditate? 
  Are you crazy? 
  Not as crazy as i used to be. 
  But still crazy enough to take an eye out. 
  What's going on here, rich? 
  Ten years, and not even a pleasant "go f*ck yourself", from you i get. 
  I always asked how you were doing. 
  Hold on there, you. 
  How could you let my dear friend sit here with an empt y cup of coffee? 
  That's alright, take it easy, kid. 
  Bring this gentleman a nice veal- parm sandwich. 
  And hurry the f*ck up about it. 
  The other two stores doing as good as this? 
  Come on, you know it's a grind. 
  That doesn't answer my question. 
  Uy. 
  Hey, look, rich, i know you're a made g so, i lose either way. 
  I always respected you and your brother jackie. 
  I'm no victim here. 
  I'm not some greaseball store owner. 
  I'm sorry, richie, i will not be shaken down. 
  Sucking up to tony soprano has done wonders for you. 
  I go away for a while, i come back, you're a tough guy. 
  Don't do this. 
  Don't do what? 
  Take what's owed to me? 
  What's owed to you? 
  I put you in action, beansie. 
  You got a bad memory, beansie. 
  Veal parmigiana sandwich f*ck you. 
  I'll be back every saturday, partner. 
  I don't f*cking believ e what i'm hearing here. 
  I'm being shak en down for what? 
  What did i do, tell me, what did i do? 
  This is not right, richie, wn. 
  I'm not gonna f*cking lay do up. 
  I'll step you won't lay down, huh? 
  You won't lay down? 
  You piece of sh1t! 
  Alright, let's get her down here. 
  I guess. 
  Where is the bride of frankenstein? 
  She's still sleeping. 
  Yeah, alright, go wake her up. 
  I wake her up? 
  Yeah, i wanna get this sh1t out of the way before i go out. 
  Let her sleep, you guy s are making too much of this. 
  Oh, no, i don't think we're making enough. 
  She was drunk. 
  Her choice. 
  There's a zuni saying: For every 20 wrongs a child does, ignore 19. 
  There's an old italian saying: You f*ck up once , lose two teeth. 
  See? 
  That's what all this is about. 
  Ego and control. 
  I beg your pardon? 
  No, please, please, don't try to mak e sense with her. 
  No, i wanna understand this. 
  Go ahead, tell me. 
  You want to hold onto control over a young woman whose entire biological determinism is to achieve independent thought and behavior. 
  And because she's exercised her independence, you wanna penalize her because you don't agree with her choices. 
  Why don't you go and g et a f*ckin' permanent? 
  I'm tryin' to watch tv! 
  Ll. 
  We good morning. 
  Oh, i'm sorry, it's afternoon. 
  Mom, please. 
  Please, what? 
  You better have some answers, young lady. 
  Yeah, that's right. 
  Okay, fine, you're punished. 
  For what, i didn't do anything! 
  You call what you did to grandma's house nothin'? 
  It wasn't my fault! 
  It's never your fault, meadow. 
  It was just supposed to be me, hunter and the macaluso twins, and then steve shows up with his asshole friend, adam, and a bunch of people from boonton. 
  Oh, so, steve's just walking around trying doorknobs 'til he hi ts the jackpot? 
  No, hunter goe s and tells him. 
  Oh, now with the hunter? 
  And she's over at her house blaming it all on meadow. 
  Me. 
  It's an old ga we're under a lot of pressure, okay? 
  You try studying day and night to get into college! 
  We've been working hard, we deserved a night. 
  Sy. 
  Take it ea sy, take it ea i'm sorry you're under a lot of pressure, meadow. 
  But, it's still no excuse. 
  So, who's this ecstasy guy? 
  I just told you, adam. 
  Ve. 
  I don't even know him, he just showed up with ste is this the same steve i know? 
  The school newspaper kid you're always with? 
  He's a flake. 
  Why do you think i stopped hanging out with him? 
  That's news to me, you don't hang out with steve. 
  It's painful to talk about, okay? 
  Well, you're gonna get punished. 
  Look, you guys, i know what i did was not okay. 
  I've been thinking about it a lot, and i'm really not feeling good about myself, okay? 
  And i think you should take away my discover card. 
  You better believe it. 
  That's right. 
  For two weeks. 
  Three. 
  How do i buy gas? 
  Your allowance. 
  I spent my allowan ce, and i already owe mom. 
  The cashmina. 
  We can wait on that. 
  Sh. 
  Alright, you get ten dollars a week, ca no more. 
  until you get your card back for gas. 
  Oh, oh, oh! 
  Come here. 
  Look at you, you look great. 
  You're all sinew! 
  If you lost that baby fat, you'd disappoint me. 
  Ou. 
  f*ck y did ya get laid yet? 
  Oh, god, i'm tryin'. 
  Ck. 
  Hey, i said four o'clo what the f*ck? 
  I leave before the stock market closes, you scream at me for not watchin' the phone. 
  Meet richie aprile. 
  Jesus christ , how you doin'? 
  I gotta tell you, your brother jacki e was like a f*ckin' god. 
  A great leader. 
  I heard a lot about you. 
  Yeah, well, i heard a lot about you. 
  That's why i'm here. 
  What do you mean? 
  Out of respect for our friend here, i'm gonna talk nice. 
  I ever hear you raise your hands to my niece again, next time you won't see my face. 
  You understand? 
  Who told you i put my hand on her? 
  Is this kid gettin' jerky with me? 
  Look, kid, i shouldn't have to explain myself. 
  I'm from the old school. 
  You wanna raise your hands, you give her your last name. 
  Then it's none of my f*cking business. 
  Until then, you keep your hands in your pockets. 
  We understand each other? 
  Now get out of here. 
  I wanna talk to tony. 
  Go on. 
  He's a good kid. 
  Capable. 
  Look, ton', this is the thing. 
  I wanna get my shy business back on its feet. 
  I keep getting these calls-- sil! 
  Where the f*ck are you goin'? 
  I'll talk to y ou later, richie. 
  You wanna tell me what just happened? 
  No more talking busine ss with the skipper directly. 
  Are you f*ckin' with me? 
  You can talk to him, but not now. 
  And never here. 
  Can you believe we drank a whole bottle of wine between the three of us? 
  Thank god. 
  Cheers. 
  Cheers. 
  Outta here. 
  Richie broke a chair over his head. 
  Are you shittin' me? 
  Then he smacked beansi e with the coffee pot and broke hi s cheekbone. 
  Prick, i talked to him yesterday. 
  He was all sweetness and lights. 
  Already, this big brother sh1t is getting old. 
  Yo, bright eyes where ya goin'? 
  Paolucc', this isn't the bing. 
  What the fuc k did i say? 
  Hey, how have you been? 
  Can't complain. 
  You look good. 
  Where are your friends going? 
  Tell them to come back, join us. 
  No, they're leaving. 
  It's my first time here, the veal is excellent. 
  What, are we makin' small talk now? 
  Nice to see you. 
  Yeah, you too. 
  Toodle- oo. 
  Not a bad ass. 
  Ps. 
  She had nice, pipe- fitter li no disrespect. 
  Hey, what do i give a f*ck? 
  I hardly know her. 
  You mean you would take the lips, over the tits? 
  Trust me, my boy. 
  There's two things i'm good at. 
  That's pulling dents, and spottin' good blow jobs. 
  And that sweetie had world- class blow- job lips. 
  Am i right, skipper? 
  Good or no? 
  What the f*ck do i know? 
  Long time ago. 
  Alright, she was good. 
  Good, or great? 
  Why the f*ck are you bustin' my balls? 
  It was a long time ago. 
  I remember every blow job i ever got. 
  How about you, you remember y our first blow job? 
  Yeah, of course. 
  How long did it ta ke for the guy to cum? 
  Did ya hear that? 
  B," i said,"you rememb er your first blow jo he said,"yeah. 
  " I said,"how long did it take for the guy to cum?" Toodle- fucking- oo? 
  What the f*ck was that? 
  God, i couldn't sleep all night, i was so embarrassed. 
  What was so wr ong with toodle- oo? 
  It's an accepted form of goodbye. 
  That's not the way i talk with patients. 
  It wasn't me, it was someone else. 
  It was jennifer. 
  For whatever reason, at that moment, er, you felt safer showing him jennif not doctor. 
  Ble i mean, what did you see at that ta that made you wanna hide doctor? 
  And who were you hiding from? 
  I saw a patient that i never wanted to see again. 
  That's who i was hiding from, a patient. 
  When you say,"see", do you mean that as in see professionally, or just plain see? 
  What's the difference? 
  There's a bi g difference. 
  If it was just a matter of plain, old,"see", then you would have been the cordial doctor and said,"goodnight. 
  " But, because he's someone you didn't wanna see professionally, you abandon the doctor facade, re. 
  And adopted the jennifer postu hence,"toodle- oo". 
  Okay, you're almost there, elliot, but not quite. 
  Young girls are not accountable for their behavior. 
  I think toodle- oo was the action of a ditsy, young girl. 
  I regressed into "the girl thing" to escape responsibility for abandoning a patient. 
  He asked me for help. 
  Look, i need you as a colleague, to tell me that i did the right thing. 
  You gotta ask yourself why you became a psychiatrist in the first place. 
  If it was only to he lp people to stop smoking or biting their nails, then, so be it. 
  There's nothin g wrong with that. 
  I had another patient who committed suicide because i was treating this man. 
  Because i had to go on the lam. 
  Oom treating patie nts from a motel r um, may not ha ve been optim but you were still there for her, you were in phone contact. 
  It would have been the sam e if you'd been on vacation. 
  Did you say,"lam"? 
  And lifting up into cobra og. 
  And, now, rising up into downward facing d coming back down into cobra. 
  And relaxing into child's pose. 
  Richie. 
  Janice, you know, i thought that was you. 
  Parvati. 
  Huh? 
  I changed my name to parvati in'78. 
  I thought you live d in california now. 
  Seattle, actually, last couple of years. 
  So, how long you been out of jail? 
  One week. 
  That's where i picked up this yoga sh1t. 
  Well, it's working for you, you seem very supple. 
  I do a lot ta stretching. 
  So, you back now? 
  My mom's at st. 
  Erasmus, a stroke. 
  At. 
  I'm sorry to hear th tony didn't say anything about it. 
  I guess we're all getting a little older. 
  Only if that's our choice. 
  You drag me all the wa y out to this place, i'm walkin' throug h the food court, this f*cking kid spill ed fried rice all over me. 
  Alright, take it easy. 
  Keep your voice down. 
  Let's talk. 
  How would you feel? 
  Es, you wrap up a dime, your crew evaporat and you walk away from me like i got some catchy disease. 
  Hey, i don't talk business with anybody, don't take it personal. 
  A guy in my position is a government target. 
  Why do you think we're meetin' in a f*ckin' mall? 
  It feels disrespectful. 
  That's all i'm sayin'. 
  I'm the guy who saved you from the hit parade. 
  When did you e ver step in for me? 
  You forget? 
  When you and my kid brother stuck up feech lamanna's card game? 
  Get the f*ck out of here. 
  Feech was made before the electric light. 
  If it wasn't for me, you two kids would a caught a vicious beatin' st. 
  To say the lea richie, you know i love you. 
  You're like my big brother, okay? 
  You're gonna be taken care of. 
  What was yours before you went away will be yours again. 
  You just gotta give it some time. 
  Jesus, anthony, you'd do that for me? 
  Hey, f*ck you. 
  What's mine is not yours to give me. 
  Hey, prick, you reached out to me. 
  I said wha t i wanted to say. 
  We got a problem, kid? 
  I'm just trying to get you to slow the f*ck down, okay? 
  Things are different now. 
  You gotta be extra, extra careful. 
  When do you know m e not to be careful? 
  When? 
  How about, you been out of the can ten f*cking minutes, already, you're trying to shake down beansie for a piece of his pizza joints. 
  Do me a favor, back off, he's a good earner. 
  Yeah, for you. 
  Hey, that's none of your f*cking cazzis. 
  Those pizza joints are strictly a cash business. 
  They come in handy. 
  He's a sneak y cocksucker. 
  Whatever, back off. 
  Are you takin' the sid e of a civilian over me? 
  Jesus f*ckin' christ, richie, i'm askin' you to do me a favor. 
  If you wanna do it, do it, if you don't, go f*ck yourself. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  Yeah. 
  How's your sister? 
  Hey, there's no need for that kinda talk. 
  What? 
  My sister. 
  Janice, how's she doing? 
  Oh, i thought you were baitin' me. 
  How's your sister, f*ck your mother. 
  No. 
  Have you seen what she did? 
  Who? 
  Meadow, that house is f*cked! 
  Ar. 
  Thought you didn't swe what are you talking about? 
  I'm outraged, no, i am beyond outraged. 
  Talk about disgrace. 
  Disrespect for other people's property! 
  That place looks like a freakin' shooting gallery! 
  It smells of urine, there's puke all over the beautiful hardwood floors. 
  It sounds like your apartment in venice! 
  Don't worry about it, she's been punished. 
  Oh, three weeks without a credit card? 
  That's some heavy sh1t there! 
  Janice! 
  If that was my child-- you know what ? 
  f*ck this! 
  You got a lot of fucki ng balls, you know that? 
  Don't talk to me like that. 
  Tony. 
  No, let's clear the air here. 
  You come ridin' into tow n like some vishnu- come- lately and try to play the concerned daughter, who the f*ck are you kiddin'? 
  You're just here to pick the friggin' bones. 
  There's a lot i could say right now, that i am not gonna say. 
  Lotta balls. 
  Temper tantrums! 
  He hasn't changed one iota since we lived in newark. 
  Not one iota! 
  You are passing judgment on him, janice, on us, as parents. 
  Dy. 
  I told you once alrea how we discipline our children is none of anybody's business. 
  You let that girl ride roughshod over you, some day you're gonna regret it. 
  Mother of god, janice! 
  Are all of you sopranos the same? 
  I asked you nice ly to stay out of it, but, you're pretending you don't hear me. 
  Well, maybe you're gonna hear this. 
  Ss, mind your f*cking busine ds, keep your mouth shut when it comes to my ki alright? 
  Maybe i've stayed here too long. 
  The fall in the shower didn't in any way affect the pre- existin g condition in your heart. 
  But you already knew that. 
  It never hurts to be sure. 
  f*cking bum hip. 
  What next, does the man upstairs have in store for me? 
  En. 
  You're lucky it was sprained, not brok the thing is, doc, i've been feeling these little fibrillations. 
  Psychosomatic. 
  You got out of jail on a medical. 
  It's the mind- body connection. 
  Your body's just pitching in to help. 
  Hey, there's my boy. 
  I was afraid you didn't get the message. 
  By. 
  Put a shirt on, i'm getting a chub doc, this is one of my dearest friends. 
  Richie, say hello to the best f*ckin' heart man in the world, doug schreck. 
  I think mr. 
  Soprano oversold me. 
  Ld. 
  I'm only the best in the western wor f*ckin' ball- breaker. 
  Doc, do me a favor, me and richie yeah, no problem. 
  He's a good kid.

  What the f uck is happening? 
  Like the man said, "may you live in interesting times. 
  " You met with tony? 
  It's more like a fucki ng audience with the pope. 
  What are you gonna do? 
  Whatever you tell me. 
  You and your brother were always good boys. 
  You tell me, this is the way it is, then so be it. 
  You tell m e otherwise, i'm yours, junio r, whatever, whoever. 
  You just say it. 
  Once again, a big welcome home to our guest of honor. 
  Richie was surprised all the changes the last ten years. 
  New jersey with its own hockey team. 
  You know, it's interesting. 
  The meadowlands is the only nhl arena where the penalty box is maximum security! 
  Maximum security penalty box. 
  Help me. 
  What the f*ck? 
  I was talking to paulie walnuts, who was under the impression that richie had been in bosnia, where there's also a large moose- lim population! 
  Get this fucki ng guy outta here. 
  And, now for all you youngsters with visions of tit- f*cking in your heads, here are the bing girls, come on! 
  Welcome home. 
  Wait'll you open it, it's all ones.

  What did you think tony soprano was gonna do for you, huh? 
  You know, you got a raging hard- on for me, and, i don't even know what for. 
  You don't? 
  Come here, come here! 
  No. 
  Come here, come here! 
  How come you weren't at the party? 
  Hey, i moved a lotta "h" for you and your brother. 
  And you guys made the lion's share. 
  You're just bitter because i invested my money smart, and you spread yours however the f*ck you did. 
  I spent mine on lawyers, you slippery f*ck. 
  You wanna talk like a tough guy? 
  Tough guy, here! 
  Hey, come on, please, no guns, come on. 
  Please? 
  What happened to tha t greaseball store owner? 
  Tell me again how you won't lay down, huh? 
  Janice. 
  Oh, sorry, is the music too loud? 
  Oh, no, it's fine. 
  Umm, i just wanted to apologize. 
  You know, about earlier. 
  No, i should be apologizing to you. 
  I was out of line, you're right. 
  I never raised a child. 
  I was robbed of that when eugene took him back to montreal. 
  I'm still petitioning the state department, but, i think they have me on their enemy radicals list. 
  When was the last time you saw harpo? 
  He changed his name to hal. 
  I'm sorry, carm, can we not talk about him? 
  Look, i just want you to know that i was way out of line. 
  Well, i'm sorry, too , really, i feel terrible. 
  You know, you're family. 
  And family means a lot. 
  I just don't feel righ t about you leaving here. 
  I don't know. 
  I don't think tony wants me here. 
  Well, where yo u gonna go? 
  The house is in no condition to move into. 
  Especially now. 
  I'll be alright. 
  No, i'm sorry, i can't let you leave. 
  Really, i want you to stay. 
  Okay, thanks. 
  Ay. 
  Ok goodnight. 
  Goodnight. 
  Oh, maybe just a little bit, the music. 
  Right. 
  Jesus, no, richie, no! 
  Jesus! 
  Should i put the chocolate in now? 
  Put it in, i'll pour the milk. 
  What did you parents finally say about last saturday? 
  The usual, nothing.

  Oh, you think this is funny? 
  That guy might never walk again. 
  Did you know that? 
  And for what? 
  Because he didn't duke you enough? 
  Because he didn't visit you in the can? 
  When's the last time you visited anybody in the can? 
  When was the last time you gave a f*ck about anybody but richie aprile? 
  Now, you remember one thing, and this you better hear. 
  You wanna talk all this old- school bullshit about the rules? 
  Well, here's a rule you might remember. 
  I'm the m*therf*ckin' f*ckin' one who calls the shots. 
  And you better pay me the respect that i gave your brother, or we're gonna have a problem. 
  A bad one. 
  Now, get the f*ck out of here!
