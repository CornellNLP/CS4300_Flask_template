  I didn't. 
  Not yet anyway. 
  Uncle junior, you got anything you wanna say about this? 
  You guys see indictments under your bed at night. 
  Right away you're ready to lam it. 
  As far as i'm concerned, it's just speculation. 
  - It's rumor. 
  - Better be safe than sorry, no? 
  I say we duck for a while. 
  And what are we gonna do? 
  Close shop? 
  We can't do that. 
  Tony, what do you think? 
  What the f*ck you askin' him for? 
  I just-- i just gave you the answer. 
  Junior's right. 
  We go on the lam now, it's open season. 
  The f*ckin' albanians will be livin' in our houses. 
  f*ck! 
  I just gave a g- note to larry boy's kid for the boost. 
  If i knew i may have to lam in a hurry, i would've duked her another time. 
  Thank you, darlin'. 
  Gotta go. 
  Say good- bye to your father for me. 
  I agree with my uncle. 
  He calls the shots, we do it. 
  But maybe, for today, for right now you were thinkin', uncle jun, that everybody should do a little spring cleaning. 
  That was my next comment. 
  We're goin' right now. 
  Let's go. 
  Come on. 
  We have to go. 
  Think they're gonna come over the weekend? 
  They're comin' someday. 
  - Where's the rest of the money? 
  - It's everywhere. 
  Well, get it. 
  What else? 
  How'bout your phone numbers? 
  Anybody who's anybody is in my head. 
  What's the matter? 
  Nothin'. 
  Just here we go. 
  Here. 
  Why now? 
  Why the f*ck now, just when things we're goin' good? 
  Boot your computer. 
  The cops are coming. 
  - So? 
  - You want them to see all that porno you downloaded? 
  sh1t! 
  You better give me your jewelry. 
  Jesus. 
  Hey. 
  They know we can't produce receipts. 
  You want'em stealing this sh1t from us? 
  Come on. 
  I'm not giving you my engagement ring. 
  This isn't stolen. 
  Is it? 
  No. 
  What do you think i am? 
  Come on. 
  Give me that. 
  Adriana! 
  It ate my whole script now! 
  You're still on the file. 
  You must've deleted the text. 
  What the fuck-- whatever, whatev-- you f*ckin' asshole! 
  All right, stop with the hysteria, would you, please? 
  If you're gonna keep behavin' like a baby, f*ck it, i'm not gonna help you, christopher. 
  - I mean it. 
  - At least you work that squirrel program in the restaurant. 
  There. 
  The text came back. 
  You put it in buffer memory. 
  What do you think? 
  Of the script? 
  Babe, i can't like give an opinion every time you add a sentence. 
  I gotta have the whole story flow. 
  I'm startin' with the dialogue. 
  "Imanugedto get the drop on him"? 
  Do you mean to say, "imanagedto get the drop on him"? 
  Or is he saying"manuge," like"manugia l'american"? 
  My tennessee william. 
  Where you goin'? 
  Get over here. 
  I have never seen you apply yourself like this. 
  I love movies. 
  You know that. 
  That smell in blockbuster, that candy and carpet smell, i get high off it. 
  I'm gonna let all this love and knowledge go to waste? 
  My cousin gregory's girlfriend amy, the one that works for tarantino, said, "mob stories are always hot. 
  " I can make my mark. 
  Babe, with these indictments, shouldn't you put the script away for a while and get rid of evidence? 
  Travel light. 
  Free bird. 
  You stole this computer, plus the one you just gave melissa. 
  - I'm writing! 
  - Turn on channel 6. 
  Turn on channel 6. 
  New jersey attorney general james d. 
  Ricci stated at a fund- raiser that a grand jury has been impanelled to investigate possible mob activities in the garden state, with indictments to follow. 
  With us is syndicated columnist and author ofmafia: America's longest running soap opera, jeffrey wernick. 
  First of all, welcome. 
  Thank you. 
  Pleasure to be here. 
  For years now, the f. B. I. 
  Has been telling us that the mafia is all but dead. 
  Let me interject. 
  While it is true that the mob is getting a standing- eight count, uh, i wouldn't call the fight. 
  The government knows this better than anyone. 
  Murder, truck hijacking as well as money laundering are expected to be among the inquiries. 
  Do we know yet the names of those who will be indicted? 
  Well, the indictments are sealed. 
  But with the recent death of acting di meo family boss, jackie aprile, my sources tell me that corrado "junior" soprano was made new boss after the death of aprile. 
  The sopranos have long historic ties to the new york families. 
  What about these possible murder charges? 
  They will undoubtedly be focused on the as- yet- unsolved execution- style slaying of soprano family associate, brendan filone. 
  Uh, was it part of a power struggle? 
  Interesting. 
  No one would ever have ranked him as associate! 
  My associates tell me that filone is a loyal soldier, if you will, and he winds up dead-- soldier? 
  Brendan filone! 
  Associate? 
  Soldier? 
  f*ck you! 
  Jesus. 
  Georgie, did you see it from the beginning? 
  Did they mention my name? 
  No-- stop the f*ckin' chitchat, all right. 
  I gotta go. 
  I gotta go. 
  Nobody makes "ginzo" gravy like you, nana. 
  You know, i'm up at bard waiting for my care package. 
  I don't like that word, jason. 
  - What? 
  Ginzo? 
  - The word is offensive. 
  She's right, jason. 
  It's not a nice word. 
  Sorry, nana. 
  - What's it mean? 
  - Derived from the word "guinea. "  
  - What's that mean? 
  - It's a derogation. 
  I have a patient, you wouldn't wanna say the word "guinea" in front of him. 
  Huh, italian male seeing a shrink. 
  Let me guess. 
  Mother issues. 
  - Why wouldn't you say it, mom? 
  - You just wouldn't. 
  What, you'd be scared? 
  Is he in the mafia? 
  I shouldn't have mentioned it. 
  Can't we change the subject? 
  No way. 
  What's he do, mom? 
  Is he in the mob or what? 
  He's not a mobster, is he, jen? 
  Nobody knows better than you, richard, i can't discuss my patients. 
  I just hope he's not one of those crumbs they're talkin' about on the news. 
  Jen, just refer him to another doctor. 
  You could do that, couldn't you? 
  - Grate the cheese, dad, okay? 
  - Sure she can. 
  That might be what you would do, richard. 
  Now i remember why we got divorced. 
  Why should i refer him to another doctor? 
  He's my patient. 
  You know you can't treat sociopaths. 
  He's scum and you shouldn't help him with his bed- wetting. 
  You have no idea who this man is, and yet you call him scum. 
  People like him are the reason italian- americans have such a bad image. 
  I agree. 
  Ask any american to describe an italian- american, and invariably he's gonna referencethe godfather, goodfellas. 
  Good movies. 
  And the rest are gonna mention pizza. 
  Good movies to eat pizza by. 
  Stop it, jason. 
  I never said he was in the mafia. 
  Why do you think we're never gonna see an italian president? 
  And that's my patient's fault? 
  - Hey. 
  - I realize you're very involved in the antidefamation lobby. 
  So go after hollywood if you feel you absolutely have to, but leave my patient alone. 
  It's a synergy. 
  News items and the constant portrayal of italian- americans as gangsters. 
  Wasn't the italian antidef deal started by joe colombo, a mobster? 
  Italians against discrimination did a study, and in its height, the mafia in this country had less than 5, 000 members. 
  And yet, that tiny, insignificant fraction cast such a dark shadow over 20 million hard- working americans. 
  Dad, at this point in our cultural history, mob movies are classic american cinema, like westerns. 
  I have to agree there, rich. 
  You know, you never saw that scotch- irish pissin' and moanin' about always bein' portrayed as, as rustlers and gunslingers. 
  That's absurd. 
  See what you started with your gravy, nana? 
  To we, the 20 million. 
  - Salute. 
  - Salute. 
  Salute. 
  - What? 
  - Get down here right away. 
  We're exterminatin'. 
  - I'm kind of busy now. 
  And get some sfogliatelle and cannoli and sh1t for the guys. 
  Yeah. 
  Twenty- nine. 
  Here you go, big guy. 
  Thank you. 
  Hey, gino. 
  What can i get you? 
  Give me some-- whoa, whoa. 
  Number 34, right here. 
  He was in line. 
  He just went out to go get gas in his car. 
  Oh, so i could go out, f*ck your sister, come back saturday, i go to the front? 
  - I said he could. 
  - Hey, poppin' fresh, i'm in no f*ckin' mood today. 
  I'm next. 
  Now get a f*ckin' pastry box. 
  Gino, what can i get ya? 
  Oh! 
  It's all right, dougie. 
  Let him go first. 
  No. 
  He don't make the rules here. 
  All right, let me have two neapolitan loaves-- you touch a single f*ckin' crust, you're gonna wish you took that job at mcdonald's. 
  - f*ck you. 
  - Okay, take a walk. 
  What about my bread? 
  You come back in ten minutes. 
  - What the f*ck do you think you're doin'? 
  - Come on. 
  Come on. 
  Get up. 
  I'm not gonna hurt you. 
  What is it? 
  What is it? 
  Do i look like a pussy to you? 
  No. 
  I'm serious. 
  Be honest. 
  I won't get mad. 
  No. 
  Why the f*ck would you give me a hard time and talk to me like i'm nothin' to worry about? 
  I- i- i'm sorry. 
  Get a pastry box. 
  Move it! 
  That's better. 
  Now fill it with cannoli, sfogliatelle and napoleons. 
  Okay. 
  - Move! 
  - good. 
  Give me the box. 
  Come on. 
  Here. 
  Next time you see my face, show some respect. 
  I will. 
  You m*therf*cker! 
  - You shot my foot! 
  - It happens. 
  Oh, you f*ckin' asshole! 
  If i'm gettin' an invitation to the dance, i wish the feds would hurry the f*ck up about it. 
  You heard what they're sayin' on the news. 
  The way things are workin', it's gonna be junior's party. 
  That was a far- thinkin' plan you had there, ton. 
  I called you last christmas. 
  f*ck this. 
  Hey, the sfogliatelle. 
  What's wrong with you? 
  What are you doin'? 
  Were you brought up in a barn or what? 
  What's the matter with you, huh? 
  This is no time to go on the rag, christopher. 
  Not with the indictment sh1t comin' down. 
  Take georgie, go in the bathroom, sweep for bugs, okay? 
  Come on. 
  Well, i hope they'll be all right. 
  - Who? 
  - The guys. 
  - What about me? 
  - You'll be all right. 
  They didn't even mention your name on television. 
  f*ckin' amazing, though, huh? 
  You know what, that news guy, he said the words,"brendan filone," i'm tellin' ya, the hairs on the back of my neck, they f*ckin' stood up. 
  - I mean, i knew the guy. 
  - They made him look like john f*ckin' gotti. 
  I brought him around here. 
  Tony wouldn't have never known him if it wasn't for me. 
  Huh. 
  I had no idea. 
  Who is it? 
  I'm sleeping! 
  Carmela. 
  Oh, come on in. 
  I- i- i just said that in case you were that snooty- ass mrs. 
  Ryan down the hall. 
  Oh, she is so shanty irish, and with all her airs. 
  Come on. 
  Get dressed. 
  I'm taking you to brunch. 
  What? 
  You heard me. 
  Get dressed. 
  What's wrong? 
  Tell me. 
  Nothing is wrong, ma. 
  Why does something have to be wrong? 
  Is it meadow? 
  She eats like a bird. 
  Everything is fine, ma. 
  Relax. 
  Nothing is wrong. 
  But you come here unannounced. 
  And i- i shouldn't wonder if something's wrong? 
  Oh, jeez. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It's a nice day. 
  I thought i would take you out. 
  I don't wanna go out. 
  Is it anthony? 
  Those indictments? 
  His father could take it in stride, but he can't. 
  I don't believe you. 
  - Come on, ma. 
  Will you get dressed? 
  - We just went to a wedding. 
  That was a big to- do. 
  This way, you and me, we get to spend some quality time. 
  The manor is gonna stop serving brunch any minute. 
  Did he cheat on you again? 
  You know, i try to do something nice. 
  I come here to take you out. 
  Right away you think i have some other agenda that i have to talk toyouabout? 
  Don't flatter yourself. 
  I'll, uh-- i'll throw something on. 
  Buckle your seat belt, ma. 
  I can't find it. 
  Where is it? 
  It's not definite. 
  I just thought i'd tell ya, you know, in case i don't show up for an appointment. 
  So, you're telling me that you're planning a vacation, but you're not sure exactly when it will be? 
  Right. 
  I may never go. 
  Let's put it this way. 
  There's a strong possibility that it-- it could happen. 
  Does this have anything to do with what's been on the news lately? 
  So, if you, uh, suddenly stop coming to your appointments, i will assume that you are on vacation. 
  And i should wait to be contacted? 
  That would be a good assumption. 
  Who is it? 
  Paulie. 
  Open the door. 
  I thought we were steppin' out. 
  I got two broads in the car. 
  You said ad' went to stay at her mother's. 
  No wonder. 
  This place looks like a f*ckin' sty. 
  What's wrong with you? 
  Talk to me. 
  This ain't like you, kid. 
  I ran into billy cracchiolo. 
  The meter maid? 
  What about him? 
  Told me the regular cops in nutley are lookin' for a guy. 
  Blew off a kid's toe for no good reason in russo's bakery. 
  Drove a lexus. 
  Does tony know about this? 
  What's goin' on, chrissy? 
  Been workin' my ass off on this movie script. 
  You know how many pages i got? 
  Nineteen. 
  That a lot or a little? 
  Books say movie's supposed to be about 120 pages. 
  Got this f*ckin' computer. 
  I thought it would do a lot of it. 
  You ain't bein' frank about the business, kid? 
  I would never do that. 
  It's only "suggested by. 
  " That writer, with the bullfights, blew his own f*ckin' head off. 
  I bought a script- writin' program and everything. 
  My advice. 
  Put that thing down a while. 
  We go get our joints copped, and tomorrow, the words will come blowin' out your ass. 
  You ever feel like nothin' good was ever gonna happen to you? 
  Yeah. 
  And nothin' did. 
  So what? 
  I'm alive. 
  I'm survivin'. 
  That's it. 
  I don't wanna just survive. 
  Says in these movie- writing books that every character has an arc. 
  You understand? 
  Like everybody starts out somewheres, and then they do somethin' or somethin' gets done to them, it changes their life. 
  That's called their arc. 
  Where's my arc? 
  Take richard kimble, all right? 
  No, that's no good. 
  His arc is run, run, jump off a damn-- run. 
  Uh-- keanu reeves, devil's advocate. 
  You see that? 
  Al. 
  Right. 
  Keanu's a lawyer. 
  Gets all turned on by money, power and the devil. 
  Then his wife says to him, "you're not the man i married. " Leaves him. 
  You see the arc? 
  He starts down here. 
  He ends up here. 
  Where's my arc, paulie? 
  Kid, richard kimble, thedevil'swhatever, those are all make- believe. 
  Hey, i got no arc either. 
  I was born, grew up, spent a few years in the army, a few more in the can and here i am. 
  A half a wise guy. 
  So what? 
  I got no identity. 
  I mean, even brendan filone's got an identity. 
  He's dead. 
  I killed that f*ckin' emil kolar and nothin'. 
  I don't even move up a notch. 
  All i got is nightmares. 
  That polish, czech, slavic, whatever the f*ck he is, is hauntin' me in my dreams every night. 
  That happens. 
  The more of them you do, the better you'll sleep. 
  I had one prick chasin' me for months in my dreams. 
  I feel like he's tryin' to tell me somethin'. 
  That we f*cked up the night that we buried him. 
  We didn't f*ck up. 
  - That i'm in danger. 
  - Could i ask you a question? 
  Why the f*ck would he wanna tell you you're in danger, considering you put a f*ckin' moon roof in the back of his head? 
  What did we do wrong that night? 
  The gun was hot, so the slugs in his head couldn't be traced back to me. 
  You know who had an arc? 
  Noah. 
  Is that him? 
  Now that would be some f*ckin' coincidence if it wasn't, wouldn't it? 
  Holy sh1t! 
  Look at that! 
  - What? 
  - He was clean shaven. 
  He's got a f*ckin' beard now. 
  You know what? 
  I read that. 
  That happens. 
  Jesus. 
  I always thought it was bullshit. 
  Oh! 
  Look at his fingernails! 
  - Oh, f*ck! 
  They're like a woman's. 
  - I'm gonna f*ckin' puke. 
  All right, help me lift him. 
  We'll take him down to pine barons before they build a f*ckin' condo here. 
  Georgie! 
  I don't know about selling this property. 
  I don't know about you, but i sure as hell could use an infusion if we're gonna support jas after he graduates. 
  It's funny how even during our marriage we saw things differently. 
  I never saw this place as an investment. 
  I always thought that we'd build a house. 
  So, are we gonna sell or what? 
  For jason. 
  But, you know, i don't wanna hear that you took one of your colleens on a cruise. 
  What's that supposed to mean, "colleens"? 
  We all know you're a sucker for those irish girls. 
  Every italian boy bows down to the freckles. 
  I married you. 
  - Yeah, i was a mother figure. 
  - Don't bust my balls with freud by numbers, would ya? 
  "Don't bust my balls"? 
  Watch it, richard. 
  Yourcalibrazeis showing. 
  What, are you somehow implying by all this i'm- i'm ashamed to be an italian- american? 
  With all the poverty, starvation, ethnic cleansing and generally horrible sh1t in this world, you devote your energies to the protection of the dignity of connie francis. 
  You know, you're all worked up about my patient, a man who has no bearing on who you are or where you are in this world. 
  Call him a patient. 
  The man's a criminal, jennifer. 
  And after a while, finally you're gonna get beyond psychotherapy with its cheesy moral relativism. 
  Finally, you're gonna get to good and evil. 
  And he's evil. 
  Sorry i'm late. 
  The alarm was-- what the f*ck is wrong with you? 
  Didn't paulie tell you i ain't been feelin' good? 
  I wipe my ass with your feelings. 
  Thanks. 
 
 
 
  Thanks a lot. 
  Drive the f*ckin' car! 
  We're under a microscope, and i gotta hear you shot some f*ckin' civilian in the foot 'cause he made you wait for buns? 
  f*ckin' paulie. 
  Don't blame paulie! 
  Makazian comes to me and says nutley p. D. S got a description and a make on the car! 
  Why don't you just leave a f*ckin' urine sample next time? 
  If i could've done it-- oh, shut up! 
  f*ckin' georgie comes into the club, he's got vomit all over his shirt. 
  I ask him,"what the f*ck?" he said you're diggin' up some body you clipped three months ago! 
  I was worried-- shut up! 
  People do that sh1t, they wanna get caught. 
  I wanna get caught? 
  You wanna get caught. 
  I seen it before, this f*ckin' "cowboy- itis"! 
  You wanna be a big, bad guy, christopher? 
  I was worried that i didn't-- shut up! 
  Can i try and explain here? 
  I don't know, tony. 
  It's like just the f*ckin' "regularness" of life is too f*ckin' hard for me. 
  I don't-- i don't know. 
  Look at you. 
  I bet you're sleepin' all the time, right? 
  It's the only thing i still enjoy. 
  You know what i think? 
  Maybe i have cancer. 
  You remember how jackie got? 
  Cancer? 
  Somethin' f*ckin' horrible's goin' on inside my body. 
  There's a physical change. 
  Does this word "cancer" pop into your mind a lot, a little bit, what? 
  - Huh? 
  - Well, i'm just thinkin' maybe you're depressed. 
  Me? 
  I'm no f*ckin' mental midget. 
  All right. 
  - Watch the, the-- - what? 
  The filter. 
  Oh, f*ck! 
  Maybe you got a, uh, serotonin problem, or whatever the f*ck they call it, ya know. 
  You know about that sh1t? 
  I saw it last night on aprogram. 
  What, take f*ckin' prozac? 
  Not this skinny guinea. 
  Let me ask you a question. 
  You ever think about, uh, you know-- f*ck no! 
  Good. 
  Can you imagine those f*ckin' losers blowin' their skulls all over the bathroom? 
  It's f*ckin' pathetic. 
  Hey, didn't you hear the goddamn doorbell? 
  I'm in the middle of a game. 
  You'll be in the middle of the f*ckin' street you don't wise up. 
  Anthony soprano? 
  What are you doing in my backyard? 
  The gate was open. 
  I'm agent harris. 
  This is agent driscol. 
  May we come in? 
  If i say no? 
  If we were local, we wouldn't even have knocked. 
  What's your point? 
  We have a search warrant. 
  We know you have children in the house. 
  Other team's waiting out front. 
  We don't think it necessary to traumatize kids by kicking in doors. 
  So, why don't you take a minute and tell them you have, uh, visitors. 
  Hmm. 
  Any quarters, you can keep. 
  You tryin' to bribe me? 
  Why don't you tell me what you're lookin' for? 
  Maybe i can save you some time. 
  - Any incriminating evidence would be nice. 
  - dad! 
  They're taking my computer. 
  I have an english paper. 
  You gotta be shittin' me. 
  I better have all my programs on there when it comes back. 
  Anthony. 
  What the hell are they doin' in my kitchen? 
  What the hell are you doin' in my refrigerator? 
  - If you forgot your lunch box, pal, why don't you just ask? 
  - I'm very sorry. 
  Mrs. 
  Soprano, how much would you say that bowl cost? 
  I'm not cleaning that up. 
  Grasso, get somethin' to clean that. 
  Grasso-- - your ass! 
  - Hey, hey, hey! 
  Tony. 
  Take it easy. 
  Take it easy. 
  Grasso, take it easy. 
  Tony, we're gonna be out of here in a few minutes. 
  Tony, let's wait in the living room. 
  Clean up the bowl. 
  Come on. 
  I know those feds are doin' their job, but it pisses me off the way they act. 
  That one guy wasn't so bad, harris. 
  Trust me, he was the biggest sneak out of all of'em. 
  It's all part of his little act. 
  And that guy that broke the bowl, he did that on purpose. 
  I don't think so. 
  He was just a klutz. 
  What was his last name? 
  Rizzo, razzo, what? 
  Grasso. 
  Grasso. 
  Do you think it's a coincidence they sent him? 
  If he wasn't an italian, he'd be back at the office sweepin' up. 
  The stupid jerk. 
  They probably frisk him every night before he goes home. 
  - Why? 
  - Why? 
  'cause he has a vowel at the end of his name. 
  Grasso. 
  What's he think, he's gonna make it to the top by arresting his own people? 
  Pass the mushu. 
  He'll see. 
  - He'll learn. 
  - We have a vowel. 
  "F"- in' right, and you be proud of it. 
  Jesus christ, you'd think there never was a michelangelo the way they treat people. 
  Did you know that an italian invented the telephone? 
  - Alexander graham bell was italian? 
  - You see? 
  You see what i'm talkin'-- antonio meucci invented the telephone and he got robbed! 
  Everybody knows that. 
  Who invented the mafia? 
  What? 
  La cosa nostra, who invented that? 
  - Who cares? 
  - Wasn't it salvatore lucana, better known as charlie "lucky" luciano who organized the five families? 
  Lucchese, gambino, bonnano, profaci. 
  Is there somethin' you wanna say to me? 
  I just like history, like you, dad. 
  - Can you just shut the f*ck up about it? 
  - Hey! 
  Hey! 
  A. J. , did you know that john cabot was italian? 
  Whoa. 
  - Like he knows who that is. 
  - It's the famous discoverer of canada. 
  The bank of america. 
  You ever heard of it? 
  One of the biggest banks in the world, started by an italian. 
  The first american saint was italian-- mother cabrini. 
  That's right. 
  Is it true that the chinese invented spaghetti? 
  Now think about it. 
  Why would people who eat with sticks invent something that you need a fork to eat? 
  And here's something else i bet you didn't know. 
  More italians fought for this country in world war ii than any other ethnic group. 
  And they won't tell you about sacco and vanzetti either. 
  The two antichrists that got the electric chair in massachusetts? 
  - Anarchists. 
  - Isn't it antichrists? 
  They were two innocent men who got the chair because they were italian. 
  How can there be two antichrists? 
  There was only one christ. 
  - So? 
  - And of course, francis albert. 
  Will i see you next week? 
  Unless you know somethin' i don't. 
  Just so you understand, that i have to charge you for the missed session. 
  What are you talkin' about? 
  We agreed on that on our very first meeting. 
  I know, but i just explained to you my situation. 
  I understand, but it's important that we respect the agreement. 
  - What if i got hit by a car? 
  - But you weren't. 
  - I know, but what if? 
  - But you weren't. 
  - I know that, but, but what if? 
  - You weren't. 
  - Why don't you answer my f*ckin' question? 
  - I will not. 
  You won't? 
  All right, fine, fine. 
  Here. 
  Here you go. 
  Of course, 'cause this is what it's all about? 
  m*therf*ckin', cocksuckin' money! 
  Here. 
  I don't understand that comment, and i don't appreciate being made to feel afraid. 
  I don't appreciate feelin' like i pour my heart out to a f*ckin' call girl. 
  - Is that how you see me? 
  - Not until now. 
  But it's obvious you don't give a sh1t about my situation or what's happenin' with me! 
  Otherwise, you wouldn't be shakin' me down. 
  It'll show as "paid" on your next month's bill. 
  Fine. 
  Stick it up your ass. 
  And how about dr. 
  Goldman over here? 
  Originally, he was gonna be a tree surgeon, but he fainted at the sight of sap. 
  Sap, ladies and gentlemen. 
  Pace yourselves. 
  Don't spend it all in one place. 
  Movie night, right? 
  Last week they showed the polish version ofrashomon. 
  Everybody remembers the rape exactly the same. 
  The'60s-- what's the matter with you, corrado? 
  Headaches, that's all. 
  Not the kind you take aspirin for. 
  Now, tonight on our show, we have mitzi gaynor, sergio franchi and a woman from france who will pull a string of lightbulbs out of her husband's throat. 
  This woman can relate. 
  I think we may have a bad apple. 
  Does tony know about this? 
  What are you gonna do? 
  There's not much to do. 
  We have to sit back and wait. 
  And do me a favor, don't let tony know you know. 
  He's under enough pressure. 
  I'm sure he's tellin' his psychiatrist it's all his mother's fault. 
  - What are you talkin' about, a psychiatrist? 
  - Yeah, a psychiatrist. 
  He's been seein' one for a while now. 
  God only knows what he says. 
  - Tony? 
  - Yes, tony. 
  Tony, who had such a terrible mother. 
  - A psychiatrist? 
  - Yes, junior. 
  For christ's sake! 
  Show of hands. 
  How many people think j. F. K. 
  Is still alive? 
  Come on. 
  They should take a zapruder film of your salad bar? 
  Hello? 
  Help me out. 
  Who? 
  The psychiatrist, i mean. 
  Do you think i know? 
  What did you say to tony about this? 
  Me? 
  Nothin'. 
  I wouldn't give him the satisfaction. 
  And, junior, i don't want there to be any repercussions. 
  A psychiatrist? 
  You're a broken record. 
  Yes, yes. 
  Shh. 
  Do i have to-- this lady is blind. 
  Dear, i have a few words for you. 
  Do i have to say it again? 
  They are lucy in the sky with diamonds. 
  All right? 
  Picture yourself in a boat at ellis island. 
  All right, how does that sound? 
  It's me. 
  Leave a message. 
  Christopher? 
  It's mommy. 
  I know you're there. 
  Pick it up. 
  Are you all right? 
  I'm worried about you. 
  My god, they mentioned your name in the newspaper today. 
  Thestar- ledger. 
  Mrs. 
  Jones told me. 
  With all those scumbags. 
  It's been a while since we met for therapy. 
  Mm- hmm. 
  Jason, how's bard? 
  I'm moving into a smoke- free dorm. 
  And how do we feel about that? 
  I'm more interested in discussing what we mentioned before. 
  Jason, are you concerned that your mother is treating this patient x? 
  I don't care. 
  As a colleague, jen, i suggest you drop the patient. 
  After her last encounter with him, she finally acknowledged that she saw the different side of him-- the subhuman. 
  I take it you were frightened. 
  Frightened, revolted. 
  At long last, appropriate emotions. 
  Oh, for christ's sake, richard. 
  You too, sam. 
  - When did we become so afraid to get our hands dirty? 
  - It's what she gets paid for. 
  Jason, how would you like to see your mother-- never mind. 
  I'm not gonna paint any graphic images. 
  See? 
  He always does that. 
  - What? 
  - Follow that up, jas. 
  Dad does what? 
  His real issue is that i should distance myself from this man on the grounds of the stigma that he brings us. 
  I say, refer this patient to a therapist that specializes in mafia depression. 
  - Sam, this isn't funny. 
  - No, of course not. 
  Jen has a real honest to goodness personal and professional dilemma. 
  You know, on my mother's side we have a few dark sheep. 
  Excuse me? 
  Lepke. 
  Who's lepke? 
  Louis lepke buchalter. 
  You know. 
  Murder incorporated. 
  My mother's uncle was lepke's wheel man. 
  His driver. 
  Uh- huh. 
  Those were some tough jews.
