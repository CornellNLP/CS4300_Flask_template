 AJ: Here, take a swig. 
  And don't backwash. 
  sh1t! 
  Don't break it. 
  Quick, it's almost time for the nuns' rosary. 
  This is eighth grade history, man. 
  Stealing the sacramental wine? 
  It's not sacramental till they bless it, moron. 
  All clear! 
  Are you gonna confess this? 
  I'm gonna tell them i stole something, not what! 
  Go! 
  Form it up! 
  Form it up! 
  Let's go, boys! 
  Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle! 
  There we go. 
  Straight lines. 
  Straight lines. 
  There you go. 
  Come on, soprano, dicarlucci, shake a leg. 
  Jumping jacks. 
  Ten of them. 
  Count'em down. 
  One, two, three, four, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, four, five, six, seven, nine, ten. 
  Eight, nine, ten. 
  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, dicarlucci, barber, soprano, let's go! 
  Sync up! 
  - What's so funny, gentlemen? 
  You care to share? 
  Sorry, mr. 
  Meskimmin. 
  Okay, kick- outs, boys. 
  Floor! 
  Kick! 
  Return! 
  Up! 
  I'm dizzier than sh1t. 
  Kick! 
  Return! 
  Up! 
  f*ck. 
  Here he comes. 
  Floor. 
  Kick. 
  Turn. 
  Up. 
  What's going on here? 
  Come on, stand up. 
  On your feet. 
  Let's go. 
  Whoa. 
  Man! 
  - I don't feel so good. 
  - I don't want any excuses. 
  Mr. Meskimmin, i gotta go to the bathroom. 
  Is that alcohol on your breath? 
  Oh, no! 
  Hey, how's the boy? 
  How am i? 
  I got dust up the crack of my ass, and I'm starvin' to death. 
  You're doin' an excellent job. 
  Allow yourself to take pleasure in that. 
  Guy's been raggin' in my f*ckin' ear all day. 
  I'd like to kill the prick. 
  You hear that, prick? 
  Get him outta here. 
  Just get him the hell out of here! 
  Is there a problem? 
  Look, you made your point, okay? 
  I made my point? 
  You made your point. 
  What point is that? 
  Enough with this work stoppage. 
  This is a union safety official, and he stays until the union deems this workplace is free of hazard. 
  I have the money. 
  You do? 
  Christopher, give the union and call and see if this gentleman here has paid up his union dues. 
  Then pop one of these wheel covers. 
  We'll check the brake pads. 
  I'll get right on it. 
  I'll get your money, okay? 
  We shall return. 
  Halle- fuckin'- lujah. 
  Gimmie your cell. 
  I gotta call Carmela. 
  You sure it was them? 
  They were drunk in gym class. 
  Byron barber vomited all over the teacher. 
  I didn't even drink it. 
  I spat it out. 
  - Anthony. 
  - On top of this, you're gonna lie to me now? 
  He's very sorry, father hagy, and he's gonna be even sorrier when he gets home. 
  Anthony, why don't you wait outside. 
  He's suspended for three days. 
  Well, at least let me pay for the wine. 
  The theft of the wine is not just a crime against property. 
  This is an affront to our holy sacristy. 
  I've asked dr. 
  Galani-- he's our school psychologist-- to join us. 
  He's been keeping an eye on Anthony, meeting with his teachers. 
  Why don't you pick it up from there, doctor. 
  Um, hi. 
  In many respects, Anthony is a normal, healthy eighth grader. 
  Sister Patricia, his art teacher, thinks he shows strong skills and spacial orientation. 
  But the thing is, though, and it's not just this one incident, Anthony sometimes has trouble following the rules. 
  Weighing consequences. 
  At times, doesn't think before he acts. 
  And it's thought that there's a good possibility Anthony could be a. D. D. A. D. D. ? 
  I'm sorry. 
  Attention deficit disorder. 
  I knew it. 
  I always knew there was something. 
  Well, what is it? 
  It's an aggregate of symptoms-- inattention, impulsivity. 
  Sometimes, although not always, hyperactivity. 
  Of course, to be sure, we'll need to give him a thorough evaluation. 
  All he needs is a whack upside the head. 
  If he's got an illness-- it's an illness, right? 
  You'd hit somebody who was sick? 
  You'd hit somebody with polio? 
  - You hit Anthony? 
  - Nobody gets hit in our house. 
  Not exactly my idea. 
  I don't know what the world's comin' to if you can't do a little tarantella on the kids every once in a while when they step out of line. 
  - So what happens now? 
  - He'll be given a complete battery of testing. 
  Psychological, behavioral, medical. 
  Let me ask you a question. 
  These other kids, you keepin' an eye on them? 
  Are you testin' them? 
  The ones that aren't named soprano? 
  There's no immediate plans for that. 
  We attend every child at verbum dei according to his own special set of circumstances. 
  And so what dowe, as the parents, do? 
  Nothin'? 
  Oh, no. 
  I mean, Anthony's misbehaved. 
  He should be con-sequenced. 
  It's a crime. 
  To suspend that child from school with all the money you give them? 
  I bet that gym teacher sh1t a brick when your little friend puked on his boots, huh, anthony? 
  - Wanna encourage him? 
  - Hey, whatever happened to "boys will be boys"? 
  He stole from the church. 
  They don't make'em any lower than that. 
  - What a loser. 
  - That's enough out of you. 
  His father was the same way. 
  I practically lived in that vice president's office. 
  - Could we not, please? 
  - Well, you only remember what you wanna remember. 
  Yeah, well, i must've had another son who stole a car when he was ten years old. 
  Yeah, he could barely see over the steering wheel. 
  He was a hellion, this one. 
  Him and his little crew. 
  They used to steal lobsters on the boats on the shore and sell'em for a buck a piece down on bloomfield avenue. 
  - Really? 
  - How many times do i gotta say this? 
  I don't want that kind of talk in front of this kid! 
  - That stuff is wrong, and i don't condone it! 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  - Who do you think you're yellin' at? 
  - What? 
  - You stupe. 
  - What did you just say? 
  - I didn't say anything. 
  - What's he doin' now? 
  What's goin' on? 
  - He yells at me like a miserable. 
  - Anthony. 
  I thought this could wait till after dinner, but your father and i have talked. 
  You are not to play mario cart or go skateboarding for three weeks. 
  And no tv. 
  - No. 
  - You're not gonna sit on that Internet either. 
  Every day, you ride your bike to green grove retirement home and visit grandma. 
  - Oh, that'll be nice. 
  - It's not fair! 
  Some f*ckin' day, huh? 
  I feel like a bomb went off. 
  All the stuff that doctor was sayin', i never saw any of that in Anthony. 
  You never noticed the way he picks at the tongue of his tennis shoe? 
  Like he can't help himself. 
  If he even has this thing. 
  Something's goin' on. 
  Carm. 
  Yeah? 
  You think he knows? 
  I don't know. 
  She knows. 
  - Are you-- - really? 
  What makes you say that? 
  - Are you in-- - i don't know. 
  Things she says. 
  She makes remarks, like this today with him. 
  - Are you in the mafia? 
  - She talk to you about me? 
  Talk to me? 
  Did something happen on that college trip? 
  - Happen? 
  - - like what? 
  - i don't know. 
  She seemed peculiar when she got back. 
  I think pretty soon we're gonna have to, you know, talk to her about the business. 
  Yeah, the two of us should sit down with meadow, talk as a family. 
  And with him, they'll give him the tests and we'll see what's what. 
  Right? 
  Good night. 
  Good night. 
  Maybe i don't wanna admit there's something wrong with my kid. 
  But this all sounds like bullshit to me. 
  What do you mean? 
  If he's got a disease, why do they tell me to punish him? 
  Doesn't that sound like bull? A D. D. 
  Is a controversial subject. 
  Is it a disease or a way for these psychologists to line their pockets? 
  Many children can really benefit by professional intervention. 
  - He got in a little trouble. 
  - You don't consider his behavior out of the norm? 
  No. 
  I don't know. 
  What do i know about it? 
  What do you mean? 
  Oh, i gotta spell it out for you? 
  Do you see his behavior as a reflection of your own? 
  Look, like i said, maybe- maybe i don't wanna admit there's something wrong, but, you know, if he's got this thing, we'll deal with it. 
  If he had polio, we'd deal with it. 
  You pick up the pieces and you go on from there. 
  So that's what we're gonna do. 
  Do you have anything else you wanna say about this? 
  Well, last time you were telling me you had intimate feelings for me. 
  But you've not mentioned it. 
  Intimate feelin's? 
  I think i said i was in love. 
  How are you doing with it? 
  Well-- i just can't turn off my feelings' cause you tell me it's a byproduct of therapy. 
  I never said you should turn off your feelings. 
  Well, i already got a girlfriend. 
  She's Russian. 
  24. 
  How old are you? 
  I find it interesting that it took you so long to tell me you had a girlfriend. 
  How are you doing with it? 
  I gotta ask you one more question about my son. 
  You think i should go easy on him now, or press him a little harder? 
  Well, that's difficult to say. 
  What, you want a raise, maybe, to figure this out? 
  Anthony? 
  Anthony jr. 
  , you get up! 
  Why? 
  I don't have to go to school. 
  I'm suspended. 
  You are not laying around in bed all day. 
  We're not runnin' a hotel over here. 
  Get up! 
  Have some breakfast. 
  I don't wanna. 
  I'm not hungry. 
  What you are gonna do today is get up and go rake. 
  You're gonna do some work around here. 
  Mom, where's my gray jacket? 
  I left it downstairs. 
  What'd you do with it? 
  Hello? 
  Anthony Jr. 
  , turn off that music! 
  Your father is sleeping! 
  You said i couldn't watch tv or play Nintendo. 
  What? 
  You didn't say anything about music. 
  Turn it off right now! 
  Why? 
  Because i said so and your father is sleeping, for Christ's sake! 
  Mom, i can't find it. 
  Where is it? 
  Johnny, come on! 
  Uncle jun, what are you doin' here so early? 
  Where's your old man? 
  He said he'd be waitin' outside. 
  - Want me to go get him? 
  - Hey. 
  Did you hear the game last night? 
  Joey pepitone, three ribs. 
  No kidding? 
  My mom made me go to bed. 
  Anthony, why aren't you on your way to school? 
  You miss your bus, you wanna walk through the colored neighborhood? 
  Junior. 
  Big fancy car. 
  We're goin' to my sister's tonight, and you promised to bring a pork loin. 
  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba. 
  Nonstop. 
  Don't you get sick of yourself? 
  Dad, could you and uncle jun give me a ride to school? 
  Not right now, tony. 
  You be good, though. 
  Pay attention to what those teachers tell ya, ya hear me, Anthony? 
  Okay. 
  See ya, ma. 
  Okay. 
  Be good. 
  Hey, wait up! 
  sh1t. 
  - Hey, rocco. 
  - Come on! 
  Move, move, move, guys! 
  Move, move, move! 
  Hey, john, john, one more day, man! 
  Don't make me come after you, you f*ckin' piece of sh1t! 
  There's gonna be a huge payoff! 
  I'll f*ckin' kill you, you piece of sh1t! 
  What do you got? 
  What do you got? 
  What the f*ck is this? 
  What the f*ck are you bringing me here? 
  Huh? 
  Who are you f*ckin' with, rocco? 
  f*ck you! 
  m*therf*cker! 
  Huh? 
  You asshole! 
  Huh, rocco? 
  Piece of sh1t! 
  You're up. 
  Who the f*ck can sleep with all this sh1t goin' on? 
  I was thinkin' about f*ckin' Jefferson airplane this mornin'. 
  How about that? 
  Made me think about my father. 
  What about him? 
  First time i ever saw him whack the sh1t out of somebody. 
  What made you think about that? 
  Something to do with my son, i think. 
  You know, what's been goin' on. 
  Why did your father whack the sh1t out of some guy? 
  I never saw him do something like that. 
  I mean, he used to whack us kids around a little bit. 
  Really? 
  Yeah, the belt was his, uh, favorite child development tool. 
  Hmm. 
  This was different, though. 
  You could tell he knew what he was doin'. 
  How did you feel about your father after that? 
  I didn't want him to do it to me. 
  Seriously. 
  What do you want me to say? 
  I'm just glad he wasn't a fag. 
  How did you and your father get along? 
  Good. 
  He was a good guy, my father. 
  Everybody liked him. 
  He knew how to have a good time. 
  He loved shellfish-- clams, oysters. 
  Taught us kids how to eat'em. 
  You put a little worcester on there, you know. 
  You suck'em down. 
  It's good. 
  My mother never ate anything raw. 
  But he wasn't around much. 
  What did he do for a living? 
  Retail meat and provisions. 
  And a little numbers. 
  Extortion, loan sharkin'. 
  How did you feel about that? 
  How did i feel? 
  About your father being engaged in illegal activities? 
  Well, i-- you know, i never really knew about it. 
  - When did you find out? 
  - Who remembers? 
  But you thought of that incident this morning. 
  Are you concerned that your son is going to find out about you? 
  Don't start talkin' to me about legitimate business. 
  What about chemical companies? 
  Dumpin' all that sh1t into the rivers, and they got all these deformed babies poppin' up all over the place. 
  Does he know anything? 
  I don't know. 
  - Has he asked you? 
  - No. 
  - How are you gonna handle that? 
  - I don't know. 
  - Did you ever talk to your father about it? 
  - What, are you kiddin'? 
  No kiddin', tony. 
  That doesn't sound like Anthony. 
  Yesterday, he's a little boy. 
  Today, i gotta worry about him. 
  Teenagers. 
  Yeah. 
  My daughter's been givin' me all this feminist sh1t about this place. 
  How it "objectifies women. 
  " You know, sh1t like that. 
  These girls are pullin' down $1500 a week. 
  This bears no weight with the principessa. 
  Meadow was one thing, but this is myson. 
  Boys are different from girls. 
  Pussy, Kevin and Matt, they ever ask you about this thing of ours? 
  I lied through my teeth, but they knew. 
  f*ckin' nitwits. 
  They love me anyway. 
  It's hard to raise kids in an information age. 
  To protect them. 
  Hey. 
  Hey, what's up? 
  Who's got an anniversary or special occasion? 
  What are these, antiques? 
  I was pickin' up the chinaman's vig, and the fed- fuckin'- ex van was wide open. 
  Guy went in for a burger or some sh1t. 
  No sh1t? 
  Fedex. 
  They're usually pretty careful with those. 
  - You did this in broad daylight? 
  - Nobody saw me. 
  That's interstate commerce, you f*ckin' mamaluke. 
  You wanna spend eight years in prison for a stupid stunt like that, be my guest. 
  I'd take a lickin' but keep on tickin'. 
  I'm gettin' the f*ck outta here. 
  Jesus christ! 
  What's with his ass? 
  He's got a lot on his mind. 
  And what do you think is going on with this one, Anthony? 
  I don't know. 
  How many more of these are left? 
  The quicker you answer, the faster we'll be done. 
  Whatever pops into your mind. 
  'Cause there's no guy? 
  Okay, good. 
  Where do you think he is? 
  Out buying food for the horse? 
  Anything else? 
  Watching tv, maybe. 
  Maybe he's watching south park. 
  Number one was supposed to be on tonight, the one where cartman gets abducted by aliens and they give him an a**l probe and it makes him fart fire. 
  You're home. 
  You know, if it's bad, the a. D. D. , they put Anthony in special ed? 
  Doctors say that? 
  No, the doctors don't know anything yet. 
  They just started the testing this afternoon. 
  I just picked up these books at the mall. 
  Help me to help my child? 
  Listen to this. 
  "Approximately 50% of children diagnosed with a. D. D receive help from special education teachers in their school. 
  " We don't even know that's what he's got. 
  You're right. 
  Let's just be ignorant. 
  Why worry about anything now? 
  You blame me, don't you? 
  Who said anything about that? 
  No, go ahead. 
  You blame me. 
  I blame myself. 
  For what? 
  "For what?" For stayin' with me? 
  I have two eyes. 
  Oh. 
  And who do we blame our daughter on? 
  Straight- a student, national honors society, featured soloist in the choir. 
  Yeah, this isn't goin' anywhere. 
  "Like father, like son," right? 
  What about "daddy's little girl"? 
  What about you? 
  You and your uncle lenny, that acrobat. 
  My son's got that in his gene pool. 
  Do i blame you for that? 
  If it helps you. 
  Hi, grandma. 
  Well, look who's here. 
  Oh, look at that little face. 
  Ow! 
  Ooh. 
  Pearl, meet me grandson. 
  This is your grandson? 
  He rode his bike all the way over to visit his grandma. 
  How do you like that? 
  How come he's not in school? 
  Because he was a bad boy. 
  Ow! 
  Yes, he was. 
  That's why. 
  Oh, he's a big one! 
  She had a stroke. 
  Now half her brain is gone. 
  Whoa. 
  So, what shall we do? 
  What shall we do? 
  Let's see. 
  Ah. 
  Let's play scrabble. 
  You'd be surprised how good your grandmother is. 
  I don't think so, grandma. 
  I'm kinda wiped. 
  Oh, you're a 13- year- old boy. 
  You're too young to be so tired. 
  They sent me to a psychiatrist all morning. 
  I took, like, a million tests. 
  A psychiatrist? 
  Yeah, you know, 'cause i got suspended and everything. 
  They sent you to a psychiatrist? 
  Yeah. 
  But that's crazy. 
  That's all nonsense. 
  That's nothin' but a racket for the jews! 
  - Dad goes. 
  - He does not. 
  - Yes, he does. 
  - He does not. 
  - Yes, he does. 
  - To a psychiatrist? 
  - Yeah. 
  - He does not. 
  - He does too. 
  - But why do you say that? 
  That's ridiculous. 
  Because it's true. 
  I heard him and mom talkin' about it. 
  What does he need a psychiatrist for? 
  Is it okay if i take that pear, grandma? 
  He goes to talk about his mother. 
  That's what he's doing. 
  He talks about me, he complains. 
  "She didn't do this. 
  She did that. 
  " Yeah. 
  I gave my life to my children on a silver platter. 
  And this is how he repays me? 
  Dad, what's that noise? 
  Noise? 
  It's a flat tire. 
  I asked you to clean those nails out of the driveway, didn't i? 
  I was prayin' for somethin' like this. 
  I spent too much money on braces for two years not to take you to the dentist now. 
  Maybe we should call the auto club. 
  We change tires at our house. 
  Watch and learn. 
  Yesterday, with the psychologist, how'd that go? 
  Okay. 
  Yeah? 
  What'd you guys do? 
  He made me look at these, like, pictures and stuff, and then i had to say something about them. 
  What'd you talk about? 
  Anything interesting? 
  That's kind of between me and my therapist. 
  He told me i didn't have to say anything if i didn't want to. 
  That's what we pay extra for at that school? 
  Anthony, the other night at dinner, you made a remark. 
  No, i didn't. 
  Yeah, you did. 
  Don't worry about it. 
  I'm not mad. 
  I just need to know what you meant by it. 
  I didn't mean anything. 
  Come on. 
  Some kids at school said some stuff. 
  What'd they say? 
  That you were in the mafia. 
  And what do you think? 
  I don't know. 
  There were all those guys at uncle Jackie's funeral, and those other guys writing down license plate numbers and taking pictures. 
  Those were feds, right? 
  Just like in godfather 1. 
  Uncle Jackie's funeral. 
  Right. 
  Then i was on the web. 
  I found this page with uncle Jackie on it. 
  It said he ran some union that ripped off these pension things or something. 
  Uncle Jackie was a complicated man. 
  But you loved him, right? 
  Yeah. 
  You didn't see me on that web thing, did ya? 
  No. 
  That's right. 
  Give me a hand with this thing, so we can get the algae scraped off your teeth. 
  I'm goin' crazy with this shit-- what he knows, what he doesn't know. 
  He's gonna find out eventually. 
  What difference does it make? 
  Me, my father. 
  It's probably in the genes, right? 
  You know, this a. 
  D. 
  D. 
  Thing. 
  It's probably all genetical. 
  But what about pussy? 
  He's an acquaintance of mine. 
  This guy is a stone gangster, and he's got three kids-- one who graduated and two who are going to villaenova. 
  - How do you account for that? 
  - Then you got leopold and loeb. 
  They cornhole and murder this kid for fun, and their father was a successful businessman, a f*ckin' millionaire. 
  Do you hold your father responsible for what you've become? 
  Yeah, sometimes i think about what life would've been like if my father hadn't gotten mixed up in the things he got mixed up in. 
  How life would've been different. 
  Maybe I'd be sellin' patio furniture in San Diego or whatever. 
  We were talking last time about how you felt when you became aware of your father's criminal life. 
  Do you have any more thoughts on that? 
  When you first started therapy, you said that you had this dream about those ducks. 
  They flew away with your pen1s. 
  It was a bad omen. 
  That something was going to happen in your family. 
  Is this the terrible thing? 
  Look, if you know somethin', please, quit f*ckin' around. 
  I think it's important to remember. 
  You said you liked the history channel. 
  He who doesn't understand history is doomed to repeat it. 
  Let's talk about your father. 
  My father. 
  - Heads up! 
  - Why are you smiling? 
  - Just thinkin' about my uncle. 
  He used to throw the ball with me. 
  The one with whom you have all the static? 
  Yeah. 
  Uncle jun. 
  He was always practicin' his curve ball outside, in front of the house. 
  I was probably about eight or nine. 
  Then my sister came out. 
  The one who lives in California? 
  Yeah. 
  Janice. 
  How does she feel about your parents? 
  Who gives a f*ck what she thinks? 
  She calls herself vishnamatha or somethin'. 
  Soprano isn't good enough for her. 
  f*ckin' wannabe dothead. 
  Why were you thinking of your uncle? 
  I don't know. 
  - What are you doing? 
  - I'm getting in the car. 
  - Why? 
  Where are you going? 
  - Someplace. 
  Dad, where are you going? 
  Can i come too? 
  No, your mother wants you to help her get the screens down to the basement. 
  No, i wanna go with you guys. 
  He said no. 
  Janice. 
  Neither one of you's will be goin' if you talk to your brother like that. 
  Go on. 
  My mother was inside, cookin' the meat for the gravy. 
  You know, the red lead, pork bones and veal. 
  It was a Sunday. 
  But you said-- i said we'd see. 
  What's the matter with that child? 
  She won't eat. 
  Please, you won't have to give me anything for Christmas if you get me this. 
  And you won't have to tell me to take the garbage out. 
  I'm not supposed to have to tell you to take the garbage out! 
  Then why can't i have this? 
  It isn't fair! 
  I don't wanna hear about that stupid electric organ anymore! 
  - It's not stupid. 
  It's fun. 
  - I said enough! 
  He won't give me a moment's peace. 
  If janice wanted it, she'd get it. 
  Janice always gets everything she wants. 
  Where were they going today? 
  I don't know why i couldn't go. 
  - That's because your sister does as she's told. 
  - That's right. 
  I forgot. 
  Janice never does anything wrong. 
  She's just perfect, perfect. 
  You're driving me crazy! 
  - No, i'm not. 
  - She said what? 
  She was high- strung, my mother. 
  Very dramatic. 
  Every night to her is a night at the opera. 
  I could stick this fork in your eye! 
  She wasn't gonna do it. 
  Holy sh1t. 
  That's why i'm rememberin' all this. 
  On account of where they were goin'. 
  - Where were they going? 
  - I found out a couple Sundays later. 
  The toll now stands at as well as hundreds of businesses set ablaze-- mom, i'm going to the c. 
  Y. 
  O. 
  To play ball. 
  Take a bat with you. 
  Look what they're doin' on springfield avenue. 
  Looting and sniper fire along springfield avenue continue with mayor lou avenitzio now placing the blame on outside agitators. 
  Come on, dad! 
  Let's go! 
  I'm comin'. 
  I'm comin'. 
  Janice, keep your sticky fingers off the car. 
  I just waxed the damn thing. 
  Can i steer? 
  Maybe on the way home, honey. 
  Here we are. 
  Come on. 
  Uncle jun? 
  Here. 
  Buy something nice. 
  My heart was broken. 
  You felt your father was showing favoritism. 
  I still remember that feeling in the pit of my stomach. 
  Did you confront them? 
  Have you been listenin' to what i've been sayin'? 
  Kids don't confront in my family. 
  But how does this pertain to the situation with your son? 
  'Cause this amusement park was where i found out my father wasn't like other fathers. 
  I took the bus this time. 
  It was three transfers from newark. 
  I had this candy bar in my pocket. 
  It had sand or lint or somethin' on it. 
  Hey, what you doin'? 
  Where you spittin'? 
  What do you mean? 
  I ain't doin' nothin'. 
  Yes, you did. 
  You threw that wrapper on the floor. 
  Pick it up! 
  Leave me alone! 
  Come back here! 
  You're gonna pick it up! 
  What in the world? 
  - I don't know! 
  There he is! 
  Stop or i'll shoot! 
  You're under arrest! 
  - Stop! 
  - - you're under arrest! 
  Give me your hands! 
  Guy's name was chicky sasso, my father's cousin on his mother's side. 
  Got out of Vietnam on account of that cop blew his knee cap off. 
  What the f*ck's the matter with you cops? 
  Can't bring your kid to an amusement park no more? 
  Daddy! 
  Daddy! 
  It's okay, baby. 
  It's okay, honey. 
  You go home to mommy, sweetheart. 
  We'll take you home. 
  Why don't you go lock up themoullions? 
  They're the ones that are burnin' down newark. 
  I wanna call my lawyer. 
  I'm not sayin' sh1t to you guys. 
  That's johnny boy soprano! 
  Whoa! 
  Asshole! 
  You're hurtin' my wrist! 
  Get the f*ck in there, clarabell. 
  He was usin' my sister janice as a front. 
  All the guys brought their daughters, so that when they did their business it would look sweet and innocent. 
  That must have been devastating. 
  Nah, it turned out it was no big deal. 
  To see your father handcuffed, being led away by the police? 
  Well, at the time, i thought my head was gonna explode. 
  He looked helpless. 
  But when i got home, my mother had a different perspective, which made me feel better. 
  - So in her pain, she reached out to you. 
  - That's one way to put it. 
  Your father may not be home for dinner tonight. 
  Go wash up. 
  I know. 
  What do you know? 
  I saw him gettin' arrested. 
  What did he do? 
  He didn't do anything. 
  They just pick on the Italians. 
  Still, in my heart, i knew my father was no freedom fighter. 
  - So he went to jail? 
  - No, he came home in a couple of hours. 
  We were watchin' ed sullivan. 
  Hey. 
  Livia! 
  Daddy! 
  Look who's home! 
  What happened? 
  What happened? 
  I stopped at nasto's, got you some cherry vanilla. 
  That didn't take long. 
  Must be in good with the uppity- ups. 
  Yeah. 
  Let this be a lesson to ya's. 
  Those stupid cops, they went to the wrong place, arrested the wrong guys. 
  How's my little girl? 
  You all right, sweetheart? 
  I'm okay. 
  Good. 
  Johnny boy! 
  Hey, johnny boy! 
  Hey! 
  Good for you, johnny! 
  Show those f*ckin' sons of bitches. 
  What's up, rocco? 
  So everything okay here? 
  I don't understand. 
  The man your father beat up was the same one who was congratulating him? 
  Yeah, one of'em. 
  Rocco alatore. 
  Why did they arrest your father? 
  He was in violation of his parole. 
  "Association with known undesirables. 
  " But nothin' ever happened about it. 
  It just kinda went away. 
  He'd been in prison? 
  He was away when i was little, but they told me he was in montana bein' a cowboy. 
  What? 
  - My son is doomed, right? 
  - Why do you say that? 
  Come on. 
  This is the part where i'm supposed to tell ya how terrible my father was and the terrible things he did to me and how he ruined my life. 
  But I'll tell you somethin'. 
  I was proud to be johnny soprano's kid. 
  When he beat the sh1t out of that guy, i went to the class, i told'em how tough my father was. 
  Do you think that's how your son feels about you? 
  Yeah, probably. 
  And I'm glad. 
  I'm glad if he's proud of me. 
  But that's the bind i'm in, 'cause i don't want him to be like me. 
  He can be anything he wants to be. 
  He could be like, um, this guy i knew in high school. 
  His grandfather invented these little ties that go on the end of salamis. 
  He made millions of dollars. 
  He's sittin' on his ass. 
  Have you communicated any of this to your son? 
  Not in so many words. 
  Probably not at all. 
  What difference would it make? 
  You said so yourself. 
  It's in the blood. 
  It's hereditary. 
  Genetic predispositions are only that-- predispositions. 
  It's not a destiny written in stone. 
  People have choices. 
  She finally offers an opinion. 
  Well, they do. 
  You think that everything that happens is preordained? 
  You don't think that human beings possess free will? 
  How come I'm not makin' f*ckin' pots in peru? 
  You're born to this sh1t. 
  You are what you are. 
  Within that, there's a range of choices. 
  This is America. 
  Right. 
  America. 
  So, livia, what do you think? 
  Huh? 
  Okies and misfits. 
  That's who goes there-- losers. 
  The beverly hillbillies. 
  So now rocco alatore's a loser? 
  I know I've had to rough rocco up because of money, but the guy's got a f*ckin' brain. 
  He's gonna open a new book out there. 
  And after that gets up, we get a little cash flow goin'-- oh, mr. 
  Cash flow. 
  Big business man now. 
  Well, what do you know about it? 
  You're scared of your own shadow. 
  Reno is growin' by leaps and bounds, livia. 
  It's a chance to get in on the ground floor! 
  After rocco gets a book up, he's gonna open a new supper club. 
  He wants me to run it. 
  A supper club. 
  Are you drunk? 
  Jesus christ almighty! 
  f*ckin' albacore around my neck! 
  Every time i try to do somethin'-- me and the kids will go without ya! 
  They are not goin' anywhere! 
  I'd rather smother them with a pillow then take them to nevada! 
  Always with the drama! 
  Livia. 
  Here you are. 
  Oh, junior. 
  You scared me to death. 
  I can't stay, but i didn't wanna let another day go by. 
  Business headaches like you wouldn't believe. 
  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
  You and theotherone, with all your headaches. 
  Who, tony? 
  You shouldn't be so hard on him. 
  He's got a lot to learn, granted, but he's headed in the right direction. 
  Where to? 
  Overbrook state mental hospital? 
  What? 
  Hey, uncle jun. 
  How ya doin'? 
  Hey. 
  He's keepin' his hair. 
  You see, what a good boy, he comes to visit his mother. 
  Um, my son's stayin' for dinner, junior. 
  I don't suppose you have time. 
  You two wanna visit each other. 
  Junior's very busy these days with his headaches. 
  Not too busy to shoot the sh1t with you, tony. 
  We gotta try and catch a ball game. 
  Yeah, you got my number. 
  All right. 
  That man is so full of himself since becoming copporuggi. 
  He makes me sick. 
  You remember the alatores, ma? 
  Oh, why wouldn't i? 
  You know, they moved to nevada. 
  They're billionaires now. 
  Oh, that rocco alatore, he was a real go- getter. 
  Didn't dad wanna go with him? 
  Your father? 
  No. 
  Yeah, he did. 
  I remember you guys talkin' about it. 
  Alatore was gonna start a business. 
  Dad was gonna do a little thing with him. 
  Oh, well, rocco just got him all worked up, that's all. 
  What is this with all these questions? 
  Dad wanted to go with him. 
  You wouldn't let him. 
  Let him? 
  Mmm. 
  What do you mean? 
  You just tell me one time your father didn't do exactly as he wanted. 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe this was his chance to get out. 
  Dad was no choir boy, but maybe with a little bit of support. 
  Oh, mr. 
  Sensitive, now. 
  Well, if it bothers you, maybe you better talk to a psychiatrist. 
  Whoa. 
  What are you talkin' about, a psychiatrist? 
  Well, that's what people do when they're lookin' for somebody to blame for their life, isn't it? 
  You're a real stone player, aren't you, ma? 
  You threatened to smother his children. 
  What does that mean? 
  Everybody thought dad was the ruthless one, but i gotta hand it to you. 
  If you'd been born after those feminists, you woulda been the real gangster. 
  I don't know what you're talkin' about. 
  Hi. 
  Hi, please, sit. 
  I know you're probably eager to hear the results of our testing. 
  How's Anthony doing? 
  Uh, good, i think. 
  Don't you think so, tony? 
  Yeah, i think so. 
  Okay. 
  Well, good. 
  Uh, let's get to it. 
  The good news is, no evidence of learning disability. 
  Cognitive function, verbal and nonverbal, intelligence testing, arithmetic and reading evaluation all within the normal range. 
  Oh, thank goodness. 
  Got a clean bill of health from his pediatrician. 
  No soft sign on the neurological either. 
  That's all the good news. 
  Now, why don't you tell us the bad news. 
  Well as to whether Anthony has a. D. D. 
  The results were interesting. 
  The a. P. A. 
  Standard is for the subject to manifest six out of nine possible symptoms of a. D D. 
  In testing, Anthony manifested five of those symptoms. 
  Five? 
  Really? 
  He often has difficulty awaiting his turn; is often "on the go," or acts as if driven by a motor; often interrupts or intrudes on others; and often fidgets with hands or feet. 
  He "fidgets with hands or feet"? 
  That's right. 
  You mean, like, he fidgets? 
  Uh- huh. 
  And that's a sickness, the fidget? 
  Mr. Soprano, it's one of nine possible symptoms. 
  What constitutes a fidget? 
  - Tony-- - no, no. 
  What constitutes a fidget? 
  So what if he fidgets? 
  He's in school. 
  Who doesn't fidget in school? 
  And he doesn't wait his turn? 
  The kid's in puberty. 
  He gets a hard- on every ten minutes, for Christ's sake. 
  - Anthony is a borderline case. 
  - Hold it. 
  He's not a case. 
  He's a 13- year- old boy. 
  That's the trouble with you people. 
  Every time you see a problem, you turn it into a disease. 
  He's a kid who made a mistake, and he's gonna pay for it. 
  But he's gonna be fine. 
  Come on. 
  Frankly, i think he's right. 
  And i don't think we should have to pay for this testing either. 
  To oppose this massive force bearing down on midway, admiral nimetts had no battleships in shape for the fight. 
  However, he had the carriers yorktown, enterprise and hornet. 
  This might prove to be the trump card. 
  You studying? 
  Government. 
  It's not the end of the world, anth. 
  I'm depressed. 
  You're not depressed. 
  You're sad and you're angry 'cause you did somethin' stupid, and you got grounded. 
  And you can't watch tv or play on your f*ckin' computer for two and a half weeks. 
  It's gonna stay like that. 
  It isn't fair. 
  Got that right. 
  What are you doin'? 
  What's it look like? 
  Can i have one too? 
  This one's yours. 
  Gonna need sprinkles. 
  Okay. 
  You want nuts? 
  Yeah. 
  M&ms? 
  Pretty good.
