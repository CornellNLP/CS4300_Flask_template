  Not even a card? 
  That's got to be a worry. 
  It's horrible. 
  Anyway, you must be so happy. 
  We're back to our old routine. 
  Ah, i love this song.

  Eat your monigott'. 
  God forgive me. 
  When he did come home that day, i was upstairs, i heard the door and then his voice, "i'm home. " I f*cking wanted to vomit. 
  After all that worrying he might be dead, praying he was okay. 
  My heart just sank, i wished-- he had died. 
  Oh. 
  To just come and go year after year like that. 
  How dare he! 
  Have you reached out to him? 
  That's a good one. 
  Listen, and i don't want my kids to know this. 
  They found a lump under my arm. 
  Oh my god. 
  They biopsed it, i get the results in a couple days.

  This song, jes listen, I've bee n to Italy many times and really, you're not missing all that much. 
  The amount of sexual harassment that i was subjected to. 
  I went one time with my friend zane. 
  Her, they didn't bother, me, they couldn't keep their hands to themselves. 
  Much less the whistling and the f*cking hooting. 
  It's not Italy. 
  Do you remember angie bonpensiero? 
  Angie belfiore married sal bonpensiero. 
  Right, she's thinking of divorcing him. 
  Halle- fucking- lujeh! 
  Do you know them? 
  No i don't know them , but to be married to a man like that. 
  A man like what? 
  The'tude and the f*cking medieval outlook. 
  He is such an adoring father though. 
  Three beautiful kids they raised, who are now from a broken home. 
  Ilk no sons i hope, three more of his we don't need. 
  He's very macho. 
  Macho, no, try swaggering mama's boy, f*cking hypocrites, shall we? 
  Hypocrites?

  Just stop. 
  Is that how you see your brother? 
  I thought we were talking about angie. 
  I mean these o . c. 
  pricks especially, with their goomahs and their prostitutes, emotional cripples. 
  And they expect t their wives to live like the f*cking nuns at mt. 
  Carmel college. 
  It's not that simple. 
  Of course not. 
  Madonna/whores is the full equation i believe. 
  Clothes, appliances, houses. 
  You are talking about me. 
  About us. 
  No. 
  Carmella, ow. 
  I don't kn that a woman of your intelligence, is content to ask so little from life and from herself. 
  I don't know, it's none of my business. 
  Marriage is a holy sacrament. 
  Ay. 
  Ok family is a sacred institution. 
  Roger. 
  And you trying to fan the flames with richie aprile, of all people? 
  Talk about old school. 
  Carm, Richie, because of h is life experience in prison, he has a sensitivity to the plight of women.

  Well you can introduce me to the boss. 
  You ca n talk to me. 
  A f*ckin' woman boss? 
  So what do you want? 
  Never happen in the states. 
  Never. 
  Our men kill each other. 
  All my brothers, for example, they all got murdered. 
  Or they go to prison. 
  Rome has a war against us. 
  But our men are in love to their mama. 
  So being a woman is not-- come se dic', comes natural. 
  We'll i'll be dipped in sh1t. 
  You go around like your father's nursemaid. 
  I am my father's nursemaid. 
  Well if an old man carries the respect of troops, you keep him around. 
  I did something like that myself. 
  We're cousins. 
  You hungry? 
  I could eat. 
  So, you wanted to talk about business. 
  Can i ask you a question? 
  We not gonna pay the price on the mercedes. 
  Why do you save your toenail clippings? 
  Why, you want them? 
  Il, if your enemy comes into possession of your na or your hair clippings, they can make the evil on you. 
  I'm flattered you wouldn't trust me with your toenails, but can i pass without ruining the moment? 
  I alread y burned them.

  In the olden time the sibylla of cumae was the second most important oracle after delphi. 
  I thought delphi was in greece. 
  The greeks were here. 
  Way before the romans, and before the greeks there were somebody else, and before them somebody else. 
  "The rulers would come from across the ancient world, "to hear the sibyl's predictions of the future. 
  She would sit inside the cave inhaling gases. 
  " I think i dated this broad. 
  "Possibly volcanic though no longer active, "and would speak in a voice not her own, delivering unto them their fates. 
  " Let's go into the cave. 
  The sibyl sat way back there, see that shaft of light? 
  Some f*cking trip. 
  The sibyl were very beautiful, in most case. 
  Oh yeah, got a premonition for me? 
  You, you're no problem to read. 
  You are your own worst enemy. 
  Oh, is that right? 
  Tell you right now you remind me of somebody from back home. 
  Not your wife, your girlfriend? 
  Oh, i got one, to answer your question. 
  But no, not her. 
  But, she's someone you want to f*ck. 
  I can tell. 
  Oh really. 
  You know, everybody's their own worst enemy. 
  So maybe your psychic power has been overrated a little bit. 
  You don't want to f*ck her?
