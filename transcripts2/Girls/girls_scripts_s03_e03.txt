 This road trip is just so unremarkable. 
 Well, what were you expecting? 
 I mean, we're picking our friend up from rehab and I just thought there'd be something I could write about in my book. 
 She told me that there was something that I needed to sign, so I could come get her... 
 No, we offered to drive her to the airport, but she said you were coming here for her. 
 There's an airport? 
 We live in a huge sprawling Metropolis where it's very, very easy to avoid the person you don't want to see. 
 Yeah, but that's so sad. 
 Why? Because we once shared true and stunning intimacies and now we're nothing more than strangers? 
 Exactly. 
 That's not sad, Hannah. That's called life. 
 I missed you so much. 
 And I would really like it if you would please stop leaving, 'cause I'm really looking forward to you being around. 
 I don't care about hair. 
 It grows, it shrinks. You can't get attached. 
 Plus, you should feel very confident 'cause I'm a lot better at this when I'm not in the middle of an obsessive-compulsive meltdown. 
 ( phone chiming ) 
 f*ck. 
 What? 
 Wait... 
 I can't hear you. Calm down. Breathe from your stomach. 
 Where are you? 
 ( Blowing ) 
 Are you serious? 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 1616 India Street. 
 Yes, see you in a bit. 
 Who did you just give our address to? 
 ( pounds table ) 
 My sister. 
 I mean, I guess I should've known what was going on from the beginning, you know? 
 But he had so many pets and was so good to them. 
 How could a man who loves animals with such a haunting totality just turn around and brutally rebuff me? 
 It doesn't make sense. 
 It's shocking. 
 It is. 
 So, I don't f*cking get it. 
 He just dropped you by the side of the road? 
 Yeah, right to the guardrail. "Go," he said, "I'm saving you from me." 
 I hitched to the nearest bus station, and a very sweet, sad-eyed clerk took pity on me and gave me a ticket, thank God. 
 I am so sorry this happened. I really am. 
 Thank you so much. You're so sweet. 
 I promise I won't avail myself of your hospitality for very long. 
 f*ck, no. You're not availing yourself of it at all. 
 Adam, we have a spare room. 
 We're happy to have you stay with us for as long as you need to... 
 No, she can't. You're not staying. 
 You can wipe your nose with some toilet paper, then you can f*cking get lost. 
 I understand your frustration with me, Addie, I really do. 
 But I have nowhere to get lost to, okay? 
 I'm unemployed and homeless. 
 I got fired because apparently nobody trusts a young, beautiful teacher. 
 They only want old, stinky ones. 
 Horrible double standard in our culture. 
 Believe me, this is the last place in the world I want to be. 
 Obviously it's not the last place because you're here even though I told you you're never welcome to stay with me again after you tried to euthanize Grandma Helen. 
 She asked me to! She said she was terminal! 
 I'm sorry that I believed our dying grandma! 
 There's not a f*cking chance! Not a f*cking chance in hell, Liney. 
 I don't know why you're being so mean to her, okay? 
 We have this whole extra bedroom for exactly this purpose. 
 We have all that fancy soap I stole from my parents' hotel. 
 I don't get why you're doing this. 
 I know you're just trying to be nice, but there is no being nice to this girl. 
 She destroys everything in her wake. 
 That's not possible. 
 She can't stay. 
 I know her better than you do. Trust me, please. I'm not being a dick. 
 Okay, I trust you. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 No. 
 Okay.

 Look, I just need you to take this video down. 
 I don't have the password, but it is my face, okay? 
 I am in the video. I can give you proof of that. 
 It's me. 
 No, it's my... yeah, it's my face. 
 I am in the video. What more do you want? 
 Do you want me to send you proof of identification or something so you know it's me? I can do that. 
 I could, like, text you my driver's license or something. 
 I'm not gonna ask him for it because I f*cking hate him. He broke my heart. 
 He, like, ruined my f*cking life. I'm not gonna get in touch with him. 
 You are a moron! Seriously? 
 Why can't you understand this? 
 No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 I did not mean to offend you. I'm really, really sorry. 
 What's your name? 
 Marcel? My name's Marnie. 
 I really apologize for losing my temper at you. 
 ( water shuts off ) 
 Hey, Caroline. 
 I am so sorry, but I forgot that my friend, um, Kerrity is coming to stay here. 
 She's an old gymnastics friend, and I just don't feel comfortable leaving her in the lurch... 
 I understand. It's totally okay, Hannah. 
 I'll be fine. 
 Okay, great. 
 I'm really not as fragile as he thinks I am. 
 Okay, good. 
 I'm really a good old girl. 
 Good. 
 But if you did have some arnica for these bruises on my thigh, that would be so helpful. 
 Did you run into something, or is that more of, like, an abuse scenario? 
 'Cause those are really... 
 You know, I don't know what to call a provoked physical attack by someone you love. 
 I really don't. 
 He f*cking hit you? 
 Where is he now? 
 Caroline: It's not that simple. 
 You know, I have a much more complex view of these things. 
 I have recently become just keenly aware of the challenge that I present to those who surround me, and I was... 
 Do you want to come to my birthday party? 
 I mean, I don't know, it might be totally lame, and I'm not sure... my mom and my best friend are organizing. 
 It could be just ridiculous, but maybe it'll take your mind off things and, who knows? 
 It would be my honor. 
 ( Door slams ) 
 Thank you. 
 Good. 
 Thank you. 
 Good. 
 Adam, can I borrow pants, a shirt, and a dickey for the birthday party, please? 
 Did I mention the drug test we require of all new employees? 
 I'm kidding. Welcome aboard. See you next week. 
 So, is that the first hire? 
 Yeah, 'cause you made me take all the Bad News Bears from the old location, which is bullshit. 
 Loyalty will get you everywhere. 
 You know, if you wrote down all these business lessons, then you wouldn't have to spout embarrassing platitudes in public. 
 Think about that. 
 The fact is, Ray, I won't be spouting platitudes much longer. 
 ( sighs ) 
 I know, you're sick. 
 The thing is, if you don't tell me what you're sick with, then I can't help you. 
 And furthermore, I can't care. 
 That is heartwarming, Ray. 
 Ray, I love you... like a son. 
 I love you like a b*st*rd son. 
 I love you, too, Hermie. I do, and I have to admit... 
 I'm kinda scared, you know? 
 Life can be terrifying, even if you're not sick. 
 No, no, I'm scared of being a boss. Like, a real, legitimate boss, you know? 
 Of making decisions for the entire team. 
 Of having boundaries and respecting those boundaries. 
 Of being the type of man that can handle all this sh1t. 
 It's simple, Ray. Don't hit anyone, don't shtup anyone, clean so that rats don't get tempted, and you got yourself a business. 
 Don't shtup anybody? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, okay. 
 All right. If it's really that simple, I can do that. 
 I can do that for you, but I'm telling you, you're gonna outlive us all. 
 You'll see, you're gonna be like Ingmar f*cking Bergman. 
 He said he was gonna die every day. 
 He lived to his late 80s on his own private Swedish island. 
 Think about it, Hermie. 
 ♪   Yeah, you're H-O-T  ♪ 
♪   Well, I get nervous  ♪ 
 ♪ And you really gotta see... ♪ 
 Ray! 
 Marnie:  Yay! 
 Holla! 
 Happy birthday! 
 Surprise! 
 It's not a surprise party. 
 Oh. 
 I'm still so excited. 
 I have no idea why he said that. 
 I specifically told him not to. 
 I forgot. 
 This is so amazing that you guys are doing this for me. 
 We're just paying. Marnie's done so much. 
 I can't believe you're turning 25. 
 Where does the time go? 
 I don't know. 
 Tad: You look so wonderful. 
 Thank you. 
 Doesn't she? I keep telling her she could look like this every day if she wanted. 
 Loreen: You really look great, sweetie. 
 Oh, um, this is Adam's sister, Caroline. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Just so healthy and clean... 
 ...and just, you know, wow. 
 Hannah: Mom, I get it. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Oh, golly. 
 Adam: Okay, okay, okay. That's enough. 
 And you remember Adam from my period of mental illness. 
 Hey, so f*cking good to see you, Mr. Horvath. 
 You're f*cking right. 
 Mrs. Horvath. 
 How are you? 
 Just a family affair, huh? 
 It's great you could make it, Caroline. 
 Anyway, so you guys should all go get drinks. 
 We're paying for all of the liquor until 10:00 PM. 
 We  are paying? 
 And if you do want to get a drink, just use the passcode, which is "banana." 
 Banana. 
 Banana, banana. 
 Marnie:  Shh. 
 Yep, it is, and if you say it too loudly, everyone else will hear it and then they'll get free drinks, so just keep it to yourself. 
 I'm gonna show you around. 
 Hannah... 
 I'll be right back. 
 So, Caroline, how old are you? 
 I love your hat. 
 You're so great to do this, especially considering everything you're dealing with with Charlie and... 
 Are you joking? This is, like, the nicest distraction for me to have. 
 It's so good for me to, like, throw myself into this. 
 And I'll have a bunch of party pictures that I can post to Instagram 'cause I know he checks it. 
 He definitely checks it. 
 He f*cking checks it. 
 Happy birthday, boo! 
 Hi, how are you, Tako? 
 Happy birthday. This is Prietta. 
 Hey, good to meet you. 
 My love. Where's Adam? 
 He's stuck with my parents. Please go rescue him. 
 I'll be back. 
 Sorry. 
 I just have something to show you. 
 Awesome. Laird! 
 Laird: Hannah, hi. On the occasion of your birthday, I present... 
 You know what? You can just go ahead and leave that in the back room with the rest of the presents. 
 Tinu! Hi! 
 Oh, hey! Happy birthday. 
 No. 
 I'll find you in a second. 
 Just really quick. 
 Boo. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Happy birthday! 
 Hello, darling. 
 Hi. 
 You look... amaze, birthday girl. 
 Thank you. 
 I have some drinks for everybody. 
 This is great. 
 Cheers. 
 Twenty f*cking five. 
 That's how old I am. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I cannot believe it. How does it feel? 
 It feels great. 
 Shoshanna: Yeah? 
 Being 25 is great. 
 It's really amazing that all three of you have accomplished so little in the four years since college. 
 I mean, think about it. Four years. 
 Four years is, like, nothing. 
 Your 21st birthday feels like yesterday to me. 
 Do you remember, we sang the duet from "Rent"? 
 Oh, my God, we sang "Take Me or Leave Me." 
 It was atrocious. 
 It was so fun. 
 It was the happiest we've ever been, remember? 
 We should do it again. There's a stage right there. 
 Marnie, I cherish you on an interpersonal level, I love this party. The last thing I want to do is sing anything from "Rent." 
 Okay. 
 ♪ Choke me in the shallow water... ♪ 
 Marnie: Guys, I really wish you weren't watching this right now. 
 Hannah: Marnie, shh, it's not that bad. 
 I just... Charlie made me do it and then he, like, put it on YouTube and he was like, "Ta-da." 
 But I should've been like, "f*ck you. Here's the video." 
 Marnie, you were definitely complicit in the creation of this. 
 Shoshanna: Why don't you just call him and ask for his password? 
 Marnie: I don't want to f*cking call him, and I do not want to know his password. 
 Maybe his password is, "I shape my pubes into a neat box." 
 People are so mean in the comment section. 
 Oh, my God, it's crazy. 
 "Please stab this Disney princess in the face and shut her the f*ck up." 
 Don't... I don't want to read... I don't read comments. 
 Shoshanna: The guy likes your tits.

 And my ex is here and I'm not really in the mood to talk...

 Oh, you know her? 
 A little bit. 
 Yeah, how'd you guys meet? 
 On the street, actually. 
 On the street? 
 This girl is crazy. 
 I mean, she was drunk and she just screams, "Hey, hottie. You know where I can find some dank weed?" 
 So I'm telling her, and then her and her friends pull me into a cab with them.

 She's mean in her heart, Hannah. 
 She's the opposite of you. She's mean inside. 
 I can be really mean. 
 She's a selfish f*cking disaster. 
 She doesn't even have the common courtesy to implode alone. 
 All must go down with her.

Which is really nice. It's nice to have running water and drapes and stuff. My Aunt Helene, you may remember, is a decorator for restaurants out in Syosset, so she's really helping me get the place all slicked out, looking legit. Right. So that's nice. And the new Grumpy's opened up. It's doing really well. Better than we expected. That's great. Yeah, so... Hermie wants to name the new place Ray's, which is pretty cool. Oh, wow. That's cool 'cause it's your name. Yeah, we got eight new employees, which I hired directly. One of my many responsibilities as manager.
