 (screaming) 
 Stop, please! 
 I don't know where he is! 
 He's your brother. 
 Of course you do. 
 (sobbing) I... I don't know! 
 I don't know. 
 (groaning) I would tell you! 
 I would tell you. Please. 
 Shh... 
 (sobbing) Please. 
 I told you... 
 We had to try. 
 Did we? 
 He's not even close with his brother. 
 We had to try. 
 man : So now what? 
 N-N-No, no, no, no... 
 (silencer gunshot) 
 Thank you. 
 Did you, uh... 
 Yes. Yeah. 
 For the rock-bottom price of 35 coffees he let me... mess with his sign. 
 What if I didn't notice? 
 I knew you would. 
 Wylie Dufresne is doing a pop-up thing tonight. 
 David... 
 I just know you've been craving those pigs-in-a-blanket since Alder closed and... 
 I told you, I... 
 I have... I have obligations that I have... 
 Okay, but the thing is... 
 (chuckling) I'm madly in love with you. 
 And, unless I'm crazy, I'm pretty sure you feel the same way. 
 (sighs) 
 David, our... our timing is... is just off. 
 I... I... I have these responsibilities, I'm... 
 I'm working the biggest case of my life. 
 So, if you solve the case, then... 
 I'm sorry. 
 (car horn honks) 
 (helicopter buzzing) 
 What is that? 
 Oh, this is a very expensive... (paper tearing) very sensitive surveillance device. 
 If you stick it inside of a lamp or a light switch, it can power itself from radial heat, so it continues to broadcast indefinitely. 
 So it's a bug? 
 It's a work of art. 
 And I want it inside Jane's safe house. 
 No. 
 You don't say no to me. 
 See, I want this up and running inside of 24 hours, or you're not gonna like the tone of my voice anymore. 
 Weller : What do you got? 
 All right, so when we were first inputting these tattoos into the database, I noticed there were a lot of these really small, stray letters all over Jane's body. 
 They were hidden in other designs, but they had the same font. 
 So I figured they were an anagram for something. 
 "A wrenchess leek knell." 
 "Leach kneel elks wrens." 
 There's about 1,000 of them. 
 The rest of them are mostly just nonsense. 
 And what you just said wasn't nonsense? 
 We inputted every possible variation. 
 And one of them hit? 
 Yep, just this morning. 
 AshwellCreekKennels. 
 The user name for an online puppy forum called Ruff Around the Ears. 
 Jane : I don't understand. 
 A puppy message board? 
 Doesn't really line up with where the other tattoos have led. 
 Criminals coop sites like these all the time and communicate because they're unmonitored. 
 What was the thread about? 
 Uh, it's in response to someone posting about a lost puppy. 
 "Could be anywhere in the United States. Not tagged. Massive reward for any leads." 
 Then AshwellCreekKennels responds, "We have the entire litter, hopefully the exact one you're looking for. Will need to provide collar as proof of ownership." 
 If they're not talking about dogs, what are they looking for? 
 Still trying to figure that out. 
 But, as the thread progresses, AshwellCreekKennels suggests that they check out a open house in Staten Island at 2 p.m. 
 Let's check it out. Nice work. 
 Zapata : I think this place is abandoned. 
 Don't look like much of an open house to me. 
 (distant siren) 
 Weller : Gun! 
 (silencer gunshots) 
 (silencer gunshots) 
 (speaking Bulgarian) Weller, stairs! 
 Oh! 
 woman : Jonathan! 
 You killed him! 
 (gunfire) 
 Reade?! 
 All clear, this area! 
 What is this? Who are they? 
 Don't know. 
 It's pretty hard to question them now. 
 ♪♪ 
 It's all clear up there. 
 How'd you know he was coming down the stairs? 
 I understood what she was saying. 
 I think it was Bulgarian. 
 Chinese and Bulgarian. 
 You must have really got around. 
 (sighs) 
 When we came in, she was over there. 
 Footprint tells me she's looking for something. 
 (grunting) 
 Well, what is it? 
 Two tickets to a gala. 
 And some sort of pin. 
 These guys are pros. 
 We found a duffel upstairs with about a dozen passports for each of them. 
 These are the best fakes that I have ever seen. 
 One set was used to go in and out of Barcelona, about a week ago. 
 Barcelona? 
 I flagged them. 
 Because they entered and exited on the exact day an American tourist was abducted and brutally tortured when he was on vacation with his family. 
 His name... was Perry Byrne. 
 woman : Where's your brother?! 
 Any idea why they tortured him? 
 His brother... is Robert Byrne. 
 The accountant who turned States evidence and put Victor Morello away. 
 Mob boss... not a nice guy. 
 Reade : The people at the house are good with guns, and they have a lot of passports. 
 I feel like they're hired assassins. 
 They're looking for Robert Byrne. 
 He could be the "lost puppy." 
 Morello wants him dead for putting him in prison and dismantling his entire crew, but he's in WITSEC. 
 WITSEC? 
 Witness Security Program. 
 Patterson : The assassins must be trying to buy his location from AshwellCreekKennels. 
 This all just happened. How is this a tattoo? 
 I don't know yet, but we need to alert US Marshals immediately. 
 Allie. 
 Hello, Kurt. 
 You're a marshal now? 
 Yeah, I was looking for a change. 
 Ohh, it's been a minute. 
 And your sister and Sawyer? How old is he now? 
 He's nine. 
 Oh, wow. 
 I know. 
 (chuckling) 
 Uh, this is... this is Jane. 
 She's working with us as a consultant. 
 Allison Knight, US Marshals. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 We picked up chatter in an online forum that points to an outsider knowing the location of Robert Byrne, who we believe is under government protection. 
 He is. 
 What concerns us is the phrasing of the correspondence. 
 It alludes to the poster having information on "the entire litter." 
 Could other Morello witnesses be compromised? 
 Not just Morello witnesses. 
 We've been keeping this quiet for obvious reasons, but we had a WITSEC data breach. 
 You were hacked? 
 Just over 2,000 witnesses had their new identities and locations compromised. 
 Excuse me? 
 We're doing the best we can to relocate them and get them new backgrounds, but, as you can imagine, it's gonna take some time. 
 You need to relocate Robert Byrne and his entire family, immediately. 
 We are... but it's gonna take at least six months to reassign the others. 
 We need to find out whoever's doing this and shut it down...  now. 
 So "the entire litter" probably means the hacked WITSEC list. 
 That would be very, very bad. 
 Weller : Yeah. 
 Well, at least we know where the the exchange is gonna happen. 
 At this fundraiser, today at 5 p.m. 
 Hold this. 
 I have a theory. 
 We found this in a hidden pocket in the duffel. 
 We think it might be worth as much as $6 million. 
 (Weller whistles) 
 "Will need to provide collar as proof of ownership." 
 The collar is payment for the list. 
 Right, so... the seller leaves the tickets and the lapel pin in the house. 
 And we know that the tickets are for the location of the hand-off. 
 But what's this pin? 
 A way to be identified by the seller. 
 That'd be my guess. 
 Yeah, because it's not like these two professional killers are gonna send an email with a photo and a description of what they look like. 
 The tickets tell them where to be, and the pin identifies who they are. 
 But if they don't know what the buyers look like... 
 Weller : ...we can go undercover. 
 Pose as the buyers and take 'em down. 
 They're expecting a man and a woman. 
 A woman who speaks Bulgarian. 
 I can do it. 
 Zapata : Wai-wai-wai-wait. 
 What if we're wrong? 
 About the pin, about them knowing what the buyers look like. 
 No, this thing could go sideways real quick. 
 We gotta take that chance. 
 All right, Jane and I will pose as the buyers. 
 You three, work the crowd. 
 Back us up. Take 'em down. 
 Let's get dressed up. We're going to a gala. 
 ♪♪ 
 (traffic noise) 
 Wow. 
 All right, all right. 
 Enough. 
 (chuckling) 
 Lookin' good, Special Agent. 
 (clears throat) 
 Thank you. 
 You should take me out sometime. 
 (laughing) 
 Yeah... that didn't seem to go so well the last time. 
 Yeah, but some mistakes are better the second time. 
 You know... all the good times, none of the surprise when it doesn't work out. 
 (laughing) 
 Yeah. 
 What do you say? 
 I could call Mike at Attaboy, get our old table. 
 Tell him to double-stock the Lagavulin. 
 Well... um... 
 No, no, I'm... 
 ♪♪ 
 Ah... I get it. 
 What? No. 
 No. 
 (scoffs) 
 Sure. 
 (chuckling) 
 The, um... tattoos sort of ruin the whole undercover thing, so they covered them with makeup. 
 (clears throat) 
 I feel ridiculous in this dress. 
 That is not the word I would use. 
 Stay safe. 
 Don't take your eyes off each other. 
 (Weller chuckles softly) 
 Now, the couple were wearing wedding rings. 
 So... 
 Oh, right, yeah. Of course. 
 Uh... 
 ♪♪ 
 man : That's a wonderful pin, sir. 
 Can I see your tickets? 
 Follow me, please. 
 (indistinct crowd chatter) 
 I'll get the car. 
 We can't lose them. 
 ♪♪ 
 I'm gonna need your cell phones. 
 As you know, my employer is an extremely cautious man. 
 Weller : Where are we going? 
 man : Why don't you wait and see? 
 (helicopter buzzing) 
 Can we trace 'em? 
 The trackers on their phones say they're still in the limo. 
 They're on their own. 
 ♪♪ 
 (helicopter buzzing) 
 Arms up! 
 Enough. 
 I said enough! 
 Jane : Hey... hey! 
 It's fine, it's fine. 
 Please, let him do his job. 
 I don't like him touching you. 
 And I don't like you touching him. 
 man : You're good. 
 Thank you. 
 man : That way. 
 (whispering) What the hell was that about? 
 You're my wife. 
 I don't know where we are. 
 We have no guns, no backup... how are we gonna arrest this guy? 
 Well, new plan: Secure the list, get out of here alive. 
 Okay. 
 The helicopter they were on filed a bogus flight plan, turned off its transponder, and stayed low enough to evade radar. 
 We have no idea where it went. 
 They paid cash for the gala tickets... no trace. 
 Whoever is behind this has gone to extraordinary measures not to be found. 
 Go over the other forum posts. 
 There might be a clue in there somewhere. 
 Yeah, on it. 
 Good afternoon. 
 A word? 
 We're actually extremely busy right now. 
 It'll just take a second. 
 What was that about? 
 I have no idea. 
 So you have Guerrero in custody. 
 One of Jane's tattoos led Weller and his team right to him. 
 Don't worry, I'm... 
 "I'm handling it." Yeah, yeah, I know. 
 Nothing about this is handled. 
 We need to contain this, immediately. 
 I'm having him sign a backdated confirmation that he was my CHS. 
 We are  way  beyond that now. 
 Whoever did this to Jane is coming for us. 
 It's plain as day. 
 Guerrero needs to disappear. 
 He's in a federal prison. We can't just... 
 Yes... we... can. 
 If we create a paper trail, all our problems go away. 
 If someone is trying to expose Daylight through Guerrero, making him legit neutralizes everything they think they have. 
 What if he doesn't cooperate? 
 If he doesn't sign, I'll release him into gen-pop! 
 Brand him a rat. It's a death sentence. 
 He's not stupid. He'll sign! 
 This is the best option, and you know it. 
 Well, we'll see. 
 Won't we? 
 (door opens) 
 (faint classical music and chatter) 
 (clears throat) 
 Lot of security for a birthday party. 
 Top of the line, too. 
 Do you think we're here to meet "Carl"? 
 I don't know. 
 Well... what should we do now? 
 We should wait... till the seller makes contact. 
 Until then... 
 ...we should try to blend in. 
 No, I... 
 I don't think I can dance. 
 Well... up until this morning... you couldn't speak Bulgarian. 
 Who knows? 
 You could be a tango champion. 
 (chuckling) 
 So, um... 
 (chuckling softly) 
 You and that, um... US Marshal over here. 
 Yeah. 
 You looked pretty... 
 Yeah. We used to date. 
 A little while. 
 Well, how little? 
 Well... 
 A year or so. 
 That's a little? 
 (chuckling) 
 We weren't... the best at communicating. 
 Well, I don't even... 
 Have you... ever been married? 
 No. 
 Never married. 
 I'm too choosy. 
 (chuckling) 
 I, um... 
 I've been having memories that make it seem like I might have been engaged. 
 What'd you remember? 
 Moments, fragments. 
 It all seemed so... far away from where I am now. 
 (approaching footsteps) 
 He's ready for you. 
 About time. 
 So it took a little doing, but we were able to recover a bunch of deleted AshwellCreekKennels posts. 
 It looks like they've been using the site for a couple of years. 
 That would explain how it got onto Jane's body. 
 My team has been lining up the language in the post with some pretty serious stuff. 
 Arms deals, massive personal identity breaches. 
 Who's doing this? 
 The helicopter, the old house... they were both paid for by shell companies for shell companies of shell companies. 
 Next to impossible to know who really owns them. 
 But... 
 They have the same accountant. 
 He did his best to cover his tracks, but all roads lead back to... 
 Rainier Abosay, CPA. 
 So let's bring him in, see who he works for. 
 That's the thing. 
 He only works for one man. 
 And he's one of the most dangerous guys in the world. 
 That's the best part of it. There they are! 
 Oh, my goodness, as I live and breathe, there they are. 
 Rich Dotcom. 
 So glad you could make it. 
 So glad indeed. 
 Wow. Did you guys see Carl? 
 Did you wish him a happy birthday? 
 Weller : No. 
 He's not actually 70 today, by the way, yeah. 
 We just did that to mess with him. 
 He is old, though. He's pretty old-looking. 
 I think he might be sick. 
 Thank you very much. Keep those comin'. 
 No thanks. 
 And, uh, I'm sorry to have to put you through all this hassle to get up here. 
 You know, I gotta play it safe. 
 Hmm. Um, hello. 
 I don't have to tell you. 
 I'm talking to two real-life, actual assassins. 
 Right? I mean... 
 I gotta tell you, this is very exciting for me. 
 Mm! Did they pat you down? 
 Not that that matters, 'cause I'm sure you could probably kill somebody with a spoon. 
 Heck, you probably don't even need the spoon. 
 So bad-ass. 
 I-I'm sorry, you said your name was... 
 Rich Dotcom? 
 Yeah, my mom was a big fan of the Internet. 
 That's a joke. 
 You guys are about as funny as I thought you'd be. 
 Come on! (clicks tongue) 
 
 
 
 Patterson : Born Gord Enver. 
 Pretty decent programmer. 
 Knocked around, made a reasonable living as a tech mercenary. 
 But here's the thing. 
 He was one of the first guys in the world to realize that the Bitcoin was gonna be a big deal. 
 Put everything he had into it, and within a couple years, he was worth $1/2 billion. 
 Smart guy. 
 After that, he changed his name to Rich Dotcom. 
 I take it back. 
 Let me guess. 
 He took all that money and did a whole bunch of good in the world with it? 
 Oh, opposite, opposite. 
 He became one of the most trusted names on the Dark Net. 
 Anything you need, if you have the money, Rich Dotcom can get it for you. 
 So he's a hacker? 
 He was a hacker. Now he's just... 
 He's a lot, lot worse. 
 (beep) 
 Hey, fellas, I'm gonna need the room. 
 Uhh! Uhh! 
 (man grunting) 
 Rich : Yeah. 
 Rich, please. I'm sorry. 
 Yeah, I'd be sorry, too. 
 Hey, wait till they get the pipes out. 
 That's gonna suck. 
 Hey, they gotta do one more pass on you guys, just to make sure you're not recording the whole thing. 
 (beeping) 
 You're clear. Step over there, please. 
 (beeping) 
 So the Monaco job, that was you guys, right? 
 Wow, I mean, that guy was a thorn in my side for so long, I'm glad someone finally "fffuh." 
 Who did it, though? Was it... 
 I mean, who actually slit his throat? 
 I did. 
 With my butterfly knife. 
 I gotta be honest, this whole thing that you got going on right now is really working for me. 
 I mean, what's the deal with you and Stubbles over there? 
 Are you guys fully... open, or is it a committed thing? 
 'Cause if it's the latter, I mean... 
 I'm okay to just watch, you know? 
 It's something that I've discovered I actually really like doing. 
 I don't know where it comes from, but it really turns me on, you know? 
 It's just sort of part of this journey, so... 
 Do you think he'd be cool with that? 
 Do you think he'd be open to that sort of thing? 
 Do you think he's an open person? 
 We doing this or what? 
 (speaking Bulgarian) Wow. 
 Okay, may I have the necklace, please? 
 I got this Hasidic guy on the premises. 
 He's a real party animal. 
 And, uh, he's gonna check out the necklace stone by stone, which is gonna take a while. 
 But, in good faith, I'm gonna give you the list. 
 Now... you just can't leave the party until the necklace checks out. 
 And, if it doesn't you're both dead. 
 I'm kidding. Or am I? 
 Sometimes, I don't even know. 
 Oh, I'm gonna need this. 
 Another pin? 
 It's another buyer. 
 I thought that we had the only copy. 
 For $6 million? 
 Get over yourself, man. 
 Do you know how hard it was to acquire this list? 
 You paid for access, not exclusivity. 
 What are you worried about, that they're gonna kill the guys you wanna kill first? 
 Don't be childish. 
 How many other buyers? 
 Just the two of you. 
 (clatter) 
 For now. 
 Look... once the stones check out, you get to go on a helicopter and go wherever you wanna go. 
 But, in the meantime, I got $100,000 worth of caviar downstairs, and some wine that's older than the First World War. 
 So... enjoy yourselves. This guy in particular. 
 Look at that stern mug on your face. 
 You need to let loose, man! 
 I mean, it's Friday night, for cryin' out loud. 
 It's Tuesday. 
 Well, it's Friday somewhere. 
 (door latches) 
 Someone else here already has the list. 
 We gotta get the other USB drive back. 
 ♪♪ 
 How are we gonna find the other buyer? 
 Their only identifying feature is the pin they're no longer wearing. 
 Well, if we can get into the security system... we can go through the footage. 
 Find out who was wearing that pin before Rich took it back. 
 Oh, my goodness, look at you. 
 So good to see you. 
 (kiss) 
 Oh. 
 What did he say to you upstairs, when I was out of earshot? 
 I think he wants to sleep with me. 
 Hm. 
 Or us. 
 It was hard to tell. 
 Perfect. 
 (soft piano music) 
 Bourbon and a martini, please. 
 You propositioned my wife? 
 Hey. Hey! 
 What? Whoa, whoa. 
 Did you proposition my wife? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Proposition? That makes it sound very seedy. 
 Get off! 
 Boys! 
 Now... You were also invited. 
 I'm kinda sweet on you as well. 
 Really? 
 Whoo, ooh, ooh... 
 Relax. Have some jalapeño poppers. 
 Thank you. 
 What was that about? 
 About this. 
 You propositioned my wife? 
 Hey! 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Did you proposition my wife? 
 Proposition? Boys! 
 You're not the only one with hidden talents.

 Hmm. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers.

 You kidding me? 
 I can't get an outside line. 
 Can you isolate the camera above the front door? 
 Yep.

 Come on... 
 Oh, there. 
 Did he walk in alone? 
 Yeah, it looks that way. 
 All right, hop up. 
 I'm gonna wipe this computer. 
 No, if you wipe it, they'll know someone was in here. 
 And if I don't, they'll know it was us. 
 We're about to make some moves. 
 We don't want them to see. 
 (static) 
 Got something? 
 We've been searching properties that Enver owns within a helicopter's flying radius. 
 Don't you mean Dotcom? 
 I'm not calling him Dotcom. 
 Any hits? 
 Seven. 
 That's a lot. 
 Some are in the city, but I think we can rule those out. 
 Not a lot of places to land a helicopter within the five boroughs. 
 Send agents to be sure. 
 The other properties are up and down the East Coast. 
 Take a helicopter and check them out, one by one. 
 We'll get 'em back. 
 Yes, ma'am.

 Okay, how do you wanna play it? 
 Gotta get him alone and take him down.

 We have to act now. 
 Okay. 
 How do we get him alone? 
 Use the one thing we have in common. 
 Excuse me. 
 Do I know you? 
 No. 
 And I don't know you.

 Trying to throw a fun party for my best friend Carl, and then I hear somebody's broken into my office and destroyed a very expensive Dutch surveillance system. 
 Then I see my favorite couple down here playing grab-ass with a valued customer. 
 I gotta admit I'm a little upset. 
 Is someone gonna start talking, because otherwise, my imagination is gonna start to go. 
 And I tend to err on the side of scary and paranoid. 
 He's a Fed. 
 No, he checked out. 
 We all checked out. 
 Okay, what makes him a Fed? 
 He came up to us... and started talking about the list. 
 So how would he know about that? 
 He's the other buyer? 
 Then I'd be real worried if I were you, because you just sold that list to the same people you stole it from.

 Impressive. 
 Mmm. Shall we? 
 Please, after you. 
 (glass clinks on table) 
 Mmm. It's too good not to share, right? 
 You guys big cognac drinkers? 
 Not really. 
 Oh, well... 
 See, the first time they distill the grapes, it comes out as this basically undrinkable wine. 
 And it's only about seven or nine percent alcohol. 
 It's basically a waste of time. 
 Should be ashamed of itself. 
 But then, they distill it again, and it clocks in at about 70 percent. 
 And it's just... crystal clear. 
 Eau-de-vie,  they call it. 
 It's French. 
 But you gotta distill it twice.

 You guys did the Monaco job together, right? 
 Yeah. 
 That's great. 
 You know, I hated that guy. 
 He was such a whiny, sniveling little... 
 Who did it, though? Who actually... put him down? 
 Don't...  look at her.

 Right... of course she did. 
 Right? Course she did.

 Gotcha. 
 Hey, guys! Crazy night tonight. 
 Um, can you do me a favor and kill these two, please? 
 (guns cocking) 
 Hey, shouldn't I be dead already? 
 Yeah, okay. You're cops. 
 Feds, right? Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, if you were mercenaries, you wouldn't have bothered to recover the second list. 
 I'm right, aren't I? 
 Yeah. 
 And, see, cops don't shoot the suspects they have in custody... it's against the law. 
 So, now that my men have their guns out, why don't you put yours down and we can call it a night? 
 Or you could kill me, and then they'll kill you. 
 I'm sure you've done the math on that. 
 Or there's that. 
 (machine gun fire, party guests screaming) 
 Come on! In the pool house! 
 Come on, run! 
 (gunfire continues) 
 Get behind the post! 
 Stay behind that pillar! 
 Agh! 
 Aaagh! 
 I'm out! 
 Right there! 
 We gotta take out those guards. 
 (machine gun fire) 
 Aaagh! 
 Aaagh! 
 Aah! 
 Reade on PA :  It's the FBI! You are surrounded! Put down your weapons! 
 We are the FBI. 
 You are under arrest. 
 Nice work today. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's the tux? 
 I couldn't wait to get out of that thing. 
 So how 'bout that drink? 
 I can't. 
 We have a housewarming thing tonight, for Jane. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks for getting that list back. 
 Oh, glad I could help. 
 He's got a few walls that may never come down... and is maybe the most introverted person I've ever met, but aside from that, you won't find a better man. 
 We should probably take those rings off. 
 Right, heh.
