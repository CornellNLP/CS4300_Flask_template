 (indistinct chatter) 
 Good morning, Assistant Director Mayfair. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Weitz. 
 My boss tells me great things about you. 
 I'm sure she does. 
 But why the hell are you packing up my office? 
 I'm running point on the Alexandra Harrison murder investigation. 
 And why does the U.S. attorney's office care about a dead salesperson? 
 It's an unusual situation. 
 It's not often the sitting head of the New York office of the FBI is material witness to a brutal murder. 
 I'm here to protect you. 
 Make sure the entire investigation stays above board. 
 Is she okay? 
 I'm not sure. She just got here. 
 They're boxing up her office? 
 That seems a little drastic. 
 I'll catch you guys later. 
 Are there... Is she a suspect? 
 Good morning, Agent Zapata. 
 Weitz. Right? 
 U.S. Attorney's office? 
 Good memory. 
 Have a good day. 
 And this page grants you sheer power of attorney when your father can no longer make financial or healthcare decisions for himself. 
 (pen scribbling) 
 Sorry, something about this just feels really final. 
 We'll get through this. 
 (grunting) 
 Whoa! 
 Okay, you're a Navy SEAL, we get it. 
 Do you wanna do a set? 
 Ugh, I feel like I just did one. 
 (chuckling) 
 Does all the staring drive you crazy? 
 I've never known anything different. 
 Right... good point. 
 It's not like I can do anything about it. 
 Not unless... turtlenecks come back into fashion. 
 You know what? 
 You could get 'em removed. I could? 
 Sure. Why not? 
 I mean, they're all archived in the databases. 
 Yeah, but you're always finding new ones, right? 
 You know, the invisible ink and layered images. 
 As an agent, of course, I should tell you to keep them. 
 As... my friend? 
 As your friend... 
 I would say... it's your body. 
 You should do what you want. 
 Take your time. 
 I realize it's a complicated question. 
 If  I had to say, if their starting pitching holds up, I think the Pirates will make it back to the playoffs. 
 Oh, but that's a very big "if." 
 I mean, their rotation's pretty thin. 
 That's why I'm keeping my arm in shape. 
 Never know when the front office is gonna call. 
 Well, look, as much I love using your sessions to catch up on sports, I am open if you ever want to discuss something more substantial. 
 Your relationship with Jane, your home life. 
 There is... something that I really wanted to ask you, Doc. 
 Do you think... anyone... is getting through the Cubs this year? 
 (laughing) 
 We need to talk. 
 How do you know Matthew Weitz? 
 Met at a cop bar a few months ago. 
 Just that one time, and he remembered you? 
 He hit on me, I blew him off. 
 Guess I made an impression. 
 Hey, hold the elevator. 
 Excuse me, excuse me. 
 Sarah... 
 What's, uh... How have you been? 
 Same. 
 You were here to see Kurt? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (metal clanking) 
 What was that? Are we stopping? 
 man on PA :  This is a test of our emergency preparedness system. Remain where you are. The building is on temporary lockdown. This is a test of our emergency preparedness system. Remain where you are. The building is on temporary lockdown. 
 Did he just say lockdown? 
 Is this a terrorist attack? 
 No, it's just a drill. 
 We just have the good fortune of being stuck in here for this one. 
 Sorry, did you just say we're stuck? 
 Okay, 'cause that's not gonna be good for me, 'cause I don't do well in small, enclosed spaces. 
 Or large, open spaces, for that matter. 
 For how long? 
 Five, ten minutes, max. 
 That's great. 
 That's just great. 
 If this is an emergency drill, shouldn't we be trying to evacuate? 
 Only if there's a fire. 
 Otherwise, the protocol is shelter in place. 
 (sighs) So every door is locked? 
 And every hallway sealed with steel barriers. 
 Trust me, in a chemical attack, that's a good thing. 
 We're gonna be here for a while. 
 Don't department heads usually get notice of these drills? 
 Apparently, not today. 
 Come on... 
 I got no bars. 
 Huh. 
 There's no reception. 
 Is that part of the drill? 
 No, it's not supposed to be. 
 All right, then. 
 (tablet beeping) 
 What's wrong? 
 I am locked out of the network. 
 And look at this error message. 
 "You are blocked access to the system. 
 Try it later again." 
 That doesn't sound so official. 
 It's like a non-native speaker wrote it quickly, right? 
 This lockdown is a smokescreen. 
 We're being hacked. 
 Someone's attacking the FBI. 
 ♪♪ 
 So who's hacking us? 
 I can't tell. 
 We need to find a way to get back to my lab. 
 Hey, do these drills shut off the HVAC systems? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 I'm worried about Sarah. 
 Just hope she got out of the building okay. 
 How has Sarah been? 
 She's okay, I guess. 
 Your father's illness must be stressful for her. 
 I see what you're doing there, Doc. 
 Guilty. 
 She'll be fine. 
 It's... 
 Sawyer I'm more worried about. 
 He knows his grandfather's sick? 
 It's hard not to. 
 Poor kid, he's only ten years old. 
 So... 
 I'm not sure he really understands... what's about to happen. 
 Well, at that age, kids are bombarded by images of death, from the TV, video games, an insect on the sidewalk. 
 He certainly understands what's going on. 
 I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
 Well, it isn't good or bad. 
 It just is. 
 The question is how he'll cope. 
 After losing a loved one, some children experience intense guilt, some bottle their emotions, others lash out. 
 He's about the same age you were when Taylor disappeared, no? 
 Discovering you were wrong about your father must have been difficult. 
 How do you think that made you feel? 
 I'm glad I found out. 
 Before it was too late. 
 Oh, I meant professionally. 
 FBI agents rely on their intuition. 
 It would only be natural for this to cause you to question your instincts more broadly. 
 Uhh! 
 Jane? 
 I'd ask if everything's okay, but it clearly isn't. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 That's not gonna make any difference. 
 Edgar : And neither will that. 
 Hey... Sarah, I'm sorry. 
 Not your fault we're stuck in an elevator. 
 No, I... 
 I mean about everything, I'm sorry... 
 It's fine. We're good. 
 I don't know. I figured I should just... 
 Sorry, can we just, like, wait this lockdown out, please? 
 Hey, this is bad, this is... I need Valium. 
 Do either of you guys have Valium? 
 Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan? 
 Sorry. 
 Yeah, I'm fresh out. 
 God, I must have something in here. 
 Come on, Kristin, pull yourself together, pull yourself together... 
 Kristin, I think I just heard you say? 
 Yeah. 
 It's just a drill. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what else started as just a drill? 
 No. 
 Well, neither do I. 
 Hey, I think you're, like, overreacting a little bit. 
 (rattling pills) 
 Paxitrol. These guys'll do the trick. 
 Weller : If we're being hacked, we probably don't have much time to stop them. 
 Wait. 
 There's only two doors between this room and my lab. 
 I can manually open these doors by hotwiring the circuits. 
 Here. Use this. 
 (Weller grunting) 
 Okay. Take this. 
 This will just take a second. 
 Heard about what happened last night. 
 That's... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Do you have any idea who it was? 
 Or why your friend was killed? 
 Someone's trying to send me a message. 
 Who? 
 I don't know yet. 
 But the longer you stay in this job, the more enemies you make. 
 Is Matthew Weitz one of those enemies? 
 You'd have to ask him. 
 (electricity zapping) 
 Okay. 
 Finally... 
 (door unlocking) 
 Hey. 
 That actually worked. 
 Weller : Patterson. 
 Give me this. 
 Patterson : All right, this will only take a few minutes. 
 It seemed faster. 
 All right. 
 Let me get into my system. 
 Please, don't break any more windows. 
 Weller : Yes, ma'am. 
 (Jane grunting) 
 I didn't know that you saw Dr. Borden too. 
 What? This was just a formality. 
 Every agent has to do one of those sessions quarterly. 
 Hey, um... 
 Are you questioning your instincts now that I'm back? 
 It's... I just... I overheard when I was... 
 It's a typical shrink question. 
 Okay. 
 And don't tell anyone else this, but, contrary to popular beliefs, not all of my instincts are right all the time. 
 But I was right about you. 
 Patterson, what do you got? 
 Whoever's doing this is... 
 Okay, wow, they got past our outside firewall. 
 They have root access. 
 They're controlling the main servers in the whole building. 
 Can you stop them from here? 
 They're adjusting my read/write/execute permissions. 
 I can only see what they're doing, I can't block it. 
 Any idea who they're targeting? 
 There's two dozen federal agencies inside this building. 
 (beeping) 
 They're targeting us. 
 They're downloading the identities for every single undercover FBI agent. 
 If that list gets out, that would jeopardize the lives of hundreds of agents and thousands of sources. 
 Patterson : Every ongoing Bureau investigation would be compromised. 
 They're trying to bring down the FBI. 
 They'll have these cover identities downloaded in an hour, max. 
 Can we track the hacker's location? 
 No. 
 As long as I'm locked out, there's no way of routing their IP address. 
 And even if I could, they could be anywhere. 
 An internet café in Shanghai, an apartment in SoHo... 
 (woman speaking Spanish) 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 If we can't track their location, we have to find a way to cut the connection from here. 
 We could go analog. 
 Disrupt the building's telecommunication lines. 
 But we'd have to get  physically  as close to those wires' main point of entry. 
 Where is that? 
 The main point of entry room. 
 No, I mean,  where? 
 That's what it's called. 
 The MPOE room, the main point of entry. 
 All right, Abbot and Costello. 
 I get it. How do we get there? 
 First, we need a way to communicate. 
 Our cell and radio signals are jammed, but I've been playing around with these collectibles. 
 Very rare. They're shortwave... so they should still work. 
 Here. 
 All right. 
 These look like they belong in a museum. 
 Thank you. 
 I collect a lot of cool stuff. 
 How do we get to the MPOE room? 
 That's the hard part. 
 It's on the other end of this floor, but because of the lockdown, all the halls are blocked with steel barriers. 
 Can't those barriers be hotwired? 
 There's too many of them. 
 I mean, that would take forever. 
 Unless... 
 Unless what? 
 Okay, okay. 
 So the building systems think we're in a drill, but if there was a  real  emergency, that would override the lockdown and initiate an evacuation protocol. 
 All the doors would open. 
 So you want to trick the system into thinking there's an emergency? 
 That's the extreme part. 
 I can't access the system, so I can't trick it. 
 We need to start a giant fire. 
 Calm... calm... 
 The meds aren't kicking in yet. 
 Kristin : Calm, calm... 
 So how's Sawyer's football team doing? 
 You said he was nervous about starting tackle league. 
 Terrible. 
 Like, really awful. 
 Oh, man. 
 He's really cute in his oversized helmet, though. 
 Tell him to make sure he stays away from anybody with facial hair. 
 There's always at least one beast child running around with a goatee, hitting everybody. 
 Sorry, can we not do this, please? 
 Do what? 
 Just, like, act like everything's okay? 
 And act like you can ask me about my son and make jokes. 
 Be my friend. 
 'Cause you, like, really broke my heart. 
 Wait a second. 
 You two used to date and now you're trapped in an elevator? 
 This is exactly like that movie. 
 The one with the elevator, where they fall in love. 
 With that girl and that guy from TV. 
 You know what I'm talking about, he's got, like, the, um... 
 Like, the face, and the hands? It really doesn't matter. 
 I thought we were stuck in here because of karmic payback for this hit-and-run, but it turns out, it's 'cause we're gonna get you two back together. 
 (chuckling) Wow. 
 Whew. 
 Those anxiety meds just hit me hard. 
 Hard. 
 Hard... 
 That is a funny word when you say it over and over again. 
 Hard. 
 Hard... 
 These drills never take this long. 
 A few years ago, we had one that lasted for two hours. 
 These things can drag on. 
 What is your goal here, Tasha? 
 My goal? 
 Where do you see yourself in ten years? 
 We were all young and ambitious once. 
 There's no shame in it. 
 I guess, uh... 
 I'd like to run a division one day, like you. 
 (chuckling) 
 Be careful what you wish for. 
 Early on in my career, someone powerful approached me, asking for help. 
 It was a big career opportunity. 
 What he was asking me to do was... morally ambiguous at best. 
 I went along. 
 Told myself that it was for the greater good, but in my gut, I knew that was a lie. 
 Didn't sleep well back then. 
 Still don't. 
 Things went sideways and that powerful person was nowhere to be found. 
 I was left alone to account for my actions, wishing that I'd trusted my gut. 
 Whatever you're doing with Weitz,  for  Weitz, just make sure you can sleep at night. 
 I told you. 
 We just met that one time. 
 ♪♪ 
 Patterson :  Once the fire gets big enough, the evacuation protocol will initiate. Every door on the floor will open. But... this is the important part... it's only temporary. 
 Then what happens? 
 Then the floor fills with carbon dioxide, the fire goes out, the doors close again and you'll be trapped wherever you are. 
 What, so you're saying move quickly? 
 Yes, I'm saying move very quickly. 
 All right. Let's get these. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 When you were a kid, you were kind of a pyro. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 What did I set fire to? 
 Everything. 
 We went camping. 
 This spot had all these little plots. 
 They had cheesy western names like Monument Valley and Little Big Horn. 
 You remember any of that? 
 (stammering) 
 Anyway. 
 You used to poke your stick in the fire, run around that site like a pyromaniac setting fire to everything. 
 Wow, I was a menace. 
 You were. 
 Now... 
 Let's see if you still got it. 
 Light it up. 
 Here goes. 
 Huh. 
 Are you sure this is gonna work? 
 Oh, no, not at all. 
 Weller :  Uh, Patterson. It's not working. 
 Okay, I guess the sensors aren't as reactive as... 
 We need a bigger fire. 
 This one's already pretty big. 
 Take it up with the sensors. 
 (alarm sounding) 
 man on PA :  Activating fire suppression system. 
 Go! Go, go, go, go! 
 Run! Run! 
 
 
 
 (door crashes) 
 We're in. Now what? 
 Okay, those wire bundles control the communication going in and out of the building. 
 Phone, cable, Internet. 
 Jane : Okay, how do we know which ones to disable? 
 You don't. Just cut 'em all. 
 Let's get started. 
 Okay, done! 
 Okay, that should do it! 
 Are you sure? 
 There aren't any lines you missed? 
 Weller : Positive, why? 
 The hackers are still downloading that file. 
 What? 
 But without these lines, no one should be able to access the building from the outside, right? 
 Unless... 
 They've been inside the building this whole time. 
 All right. 
 Patterson, I've opened this box. 
 How do I hotwire this door? 
 It's kinda intricate, but I'll try to talk you through it. 
 Okay. 
 (steam hissing) 
 Well, you better hurry! 
 The hackers know that we're onto them! 
 They've activated the CO2 system! 
 Oh, no. 
 What? 
 They only have about a minute of breathable air left. 
 Patterson! Talk me through opening this door! 
 Stop talking. Every word you say will eat up oxygen. Start by finding the red wire. 
 You wanna be a little more specific?! 
 Thick red wire with a blue stripe. 
 Got it! 
 Don't speak. 
 Okay, there's a bunch of green wires, grab those. One will feel hot, cut that one. 
 There are three orange wires. Take the second one from the top. 
 Link it with the bottom one and then take that bottom one... 
 No, no! Don't touch the purple ones. The purple one needs to stay where it is. 
 Okay. Last step. 
 Touch the B grouping of wires to the primary power regulator. 
 That should have opened the door, right? 
 Weller? 
 Jane. 
 (coughing) 
 Weller :  We're out! 
 The hackers know we're onto them. 
 They're gonna try to bolt. 
 We can't let them leave. 
 I'm sure they've already got a list of buyers set up. 
 They get out of this building, it's all over. 
 Okay, so how do we find them? 
 This is a 70-floor building, they could be anywhere. 
 If it were me, I would set up where there was physical network access. 
 I would plug directly into the building's main server room. 
 No, wait, wait, wait. 
 What? 
 We don't know how many people we're dealing with. 
 If we're gonna take them down, we need to get our weapons. 
 You don't have time. 
 You're way too far from the locker-room. 
 Patterson, we're near the evidence room, aren't we? 
 Patterson :  Yeah, you should be right underneath it. 
 You up for a climb? 
 (grunting) Almost there. 
 (grunting) 
 It was a... a lot easier going down. 
 Do you need a break? 
 No. Why? Do you? 
 (panting) 
 Of course not. 
 You're right. 
 I lied about how I knew Weitz. 
 He approached me about helping him with an investigation. 
 Investigation of what? 
 In his words, corruption in the Bureau. 
 He thinks you're dirty. 
 And you believed him? 
 I guess that answers my question. 
 It's not that I think he's right. 
 But I haven't heard convincing evidence that he's wrong. 
 I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware that part of my job was proving to subordinates that I'm not a criminal. 
 You have to admit, you have been acting... 
 I don't know, just... secretive! 
 Especially since Jane arrived. 
 For example? 
 For example, not telling us that one of your case file numbers was tattooed on Jane's body. 
 We caught Guerrero! 
 But we could have caught him sooner, gotten headway into who tattooed that case on Jane. 
 Then there were all those secret meetings with Carter, right up until his disappearance. 
 Hang on. 
 What exactly is Weitz accusing me of? 
 He didn't say, but he did point out this pattern of people around you ending up dead. 
 Your friend last night and Carter and Guerrero and... 
 Go on. 
 Go on, say it! 
 Sofia Varma. 
 Something is going on here. 
 I don't know what it is, and I don't know if Weitz does, either. 
 But he is going to find it, whether I help him or not. 
 And if you had doubts, why didn't you come to me? 
 How do you think that conversation would have gone? 
 Okay. 
 How am I gonna continue having you on my team when you don't trust me as a leader? 
 Quiet your mind. 
 I know you don't want to talk about it, Sarah, but... 
 Look... 
 I thought you were different, but you're just like my brother. 
 You have no idea how to let people in. 
 So thank you, genuinely. 
 Thank you for ending it before I... introduced you to my son. 
 ♪♪ 
 I think we came to the right place. 
 (gun clicks) 
 A little overkill. 
 It's better to have ten guns and only need one than the other way around. 
 How're we gonna get through the barrier doors? 
 Ah, that's a good question. 
 (Weller grunting) 
 That'll work. 
 (electricity sizzling) 
 More backup! I was hoping we'd run into some more agents. 
 What's going on? 
 We got hacked. 
 (sizzling) 
 Vamonos. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 Show me your hands! 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 Both of them! Lift the other one! 
 (gunfire) 
 Hey... 
 Okay. 
 Si, si. 
 Okay? 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 (beep) 
 (gunfire) 
 Uhh! 
 (gunfire) 
 She's down. 
 She's gone. 
 Our suspect's down. 
 Where's Morales? 
 Ohh. 
 The other suspect? 
 Got away. 
 This should bypass the lockdown, get me basic system access. 
 Here. I found this on the hacker we took down. 
 Nicole Serrano, custodial staff. 
 Pretty sophisticated skill set for a janitor. 
 Can you bring up the rest of that department? 
 Yeah. 
 There. 
 That's him. 
 Okay. Carlos Wanzer. 
 Looks like they started the same day last August. 
 So he must have been planning this hack the whole time. 
 Carlos :  I still have control of the building. If you do not release Nicole, I will drop everyone off the elevators from the top floor. Everyone inside will die. You have ten minutes. 
 It's gonna be kind of hard to release a dead girl. 
 How many elevators in this building? 
 And how many of them are occupied? 
 30 elevators, and as far as occupancy, I think I can access security feeds from here. 
 (computer beeping) 
 Whoa. Patterson. 
 Who's in that elevator? 
 Patterson : Oh, no. 
 Who was that? 
 I'm not sure. 
 (clanking, elevator whirs) 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's okay. 
 We're gonna be okay. 
 Oh, my God. Oh... 
 (gasping) 
 You said this was a drill, what's going on? 
 I don't know, but I'm not gonna let anything happen to us, all right? 
 He's lifting every elevator to the top floor. 
 Is there anything you can do to override him? 
 Patterson : I can engage the brakes on almost all of them except SIOC. 
 Our elevator's on a secure circuit. 
 There's nothing I can do. 
 My sister and Reade are in that elevator. 
 We have to do everything that we can to stop this guy. 
 He's gone wireless, so I can probably track him. 
 It's gonna take a few minutes, but I can find him. 
 What about the doors? 
 I gotta work on the elevators one at a time. 
 You gotta lance the doors. 
 Mayfair : All right. 
 Open the door to the stairwell first. 
 Zapata and I will track the hacker. 
 You and Jane head up to the top floor and see if you can pull them out of that elevator. 
 We got 70 floors to go. Let's move! 
 He's in the east wing. 
 Copy that. (crashing) (gasping) Okay, we're gonna find a way out. All right? Just be calm. Sarah : Oh, my God. Do you have anything to unscrew these? Um... Um... Okay. This'll work. All right, okay. If we're close enough to a floor level, maybe we can climb our way out. It's too high. Come on! Last one up buys drinks. Patterson :  Got it. I tracked his tablet's wireless signal. He's in the service hallway on the first floor. How much time do we have? Less than five minutes. I have control of the other elevators, but I can't do anything about SIOC. Sarah! Kurt! Kurt! Reade! We're gonna get you guys out, all right? All right, just hang on! Are we landing? On your knees! Don't even think about it. I told you to release Nicole. Where is she? I don't think you understand the concept of leverage. The elevators are set to drop on a timer, unless I input my password. The elevator drops in... two minutes, 50 seconds. If you kill me, everyone dies. Now, what was that about leverage? All right, back up. No, no, no, no... One at a time. Come on, Reade. I'm very afraid... We gotta move fast. I'm very, very afraid of heights. Calm, just put your left arm through here and your head. "Calm." Just keep saying it. Weller, ready! (grunting) Calm. Not calm! Not calm, not calm, not calm, not calm! Here we go. Okay, arms up. You're safe. Weller : Reade! You both gotta get on! We're running out of time! Copy! All right. Put your left arm through first. Listen, what I said before... No, we'll talk about it when we both get on solid ground, okay? All right? She's all set! (Weller grunting) All right, stay calm. Come on. Just hold on tight. (grunting) Oh, God. (Weller shouts) It's not strong enough! All right, well, take Sarah then throw the hose back down for me! No, I'm not leaving you! Sarah, you gotta go now. Stop the countdown, now! Let Nicole go... and no one has to get hurt. Carlos... Can you override it? It's a 256-bit encryption key. Not enough time. Arms up, arms up. Get over there. Reade, get ready! Weller : Just hold on tight. (Reade shouting) (crash, all gasping) (Weller grunting) Reade! You okay? I'll be better when you pull me back up. You okay? Hey. A few nicks and bruises, nothing that won't heal. (chuckling) You're safe now, little sis. Hey, Kurt. Can Sarah and I get a minute? Yeah. Uh... Hey, are you okay? My heart rate's finally in the double digits, so... Sarah, there's something you need to know. So I'm moving to Portland. Um, my ex lives there and... I think Sawyer needs to have a relationship with his father. When did you decide this? I've been on the fence for a few weeks, and, uh, with what happened today, it just became very, very clear. I mean, if something had happened to me, what would Sawyer have done? But nothing happened, you're fine. I'm sorry for what I said in there. This is not about you. It's not about us. I just really need to do what's right for my family. Come here. Hey... Good work up there. You too. Patterson dug down on those hackers. They did the same thing to the Mexican Secret Service last year. You okay? Something on your mind? I don't know how to say this. It's okay. You can tell me. Kurt, I, um... I totally beat you up the stairs. Really? Wow. All right. Fine. Whatever helps you sleep at night. Mm-hmm. You owe me a drink. And you still owe me one for my birthday. Wow... racking up the debt. Never seems to work out. What about tonight? Sure. Okay. I could definitely use a drink. Yeah. Bethany Mayfair, you're under arrest for first-degree murder. Hands behind your back. What the hell is going on? You'll read that in the paper tomorrow. We gotta get her to holding. The hell you are. Not without an explanation. Actually, it might be better for you to hear this, too. Put her in the interrogation room. Weitz :  For someone who's just been arrested, you seem awfully relaxed. Because I know what you're gonna say. (chuckles) Oh... Please, I would love to, uh... My prints were all over the room. I had blood on my hands from checking her pulse. That is all true. So, to clarify, I should have let Alexandra bleed out so as not to interfere with an active crime scene. Well, ahem, let's start with this. Alexandra Harrison was an alias. Her real name was Donna Hollaran. She was a disgraced private-eye-turned-fixer, and she's been under federal investigation for a decade. (laughing) So, apparently, I didn't even know her name, and you think I killed her. Yes. Along with Saul Guerrero and the CIA's own Tom Carter. What about Kennedy and Hoffa? Here's what I think happened. For years, you and Carter had an off-book project. I'm guessing something that involved some legal dealings with everyone's favorite Latin mob boss, Saul Guerrero. When he gets arrested, you two are afraid he's gonna roll over on you, and so you and Carter have Guerrero killed. But Carter, maybe he doesn't warn you about the timing, 'cause you're there when the hit goes down. You think he's trying to implicate you, so you and Carter have words, things get heated, ba ba ba, and then you kill Carter, too. (scoffs) Are you finished? No. No, not quite. See, Carter's murder, that wasn't planned. You needed help making that body disappear, so you call Donna. She wasn't on FBI's radar and you trade her favors for help, but then she tries to blackmail you. And you pay at first, but then she wants more, and so you kill Donna to close a loop. This is ridiculous. This is a witch hunt. Murder charges require evidence. That's right, yes, they do. And I was just about to get to that. Let's start with the paper trail, or rather lack thereof. Now, I assume that you and Donna had crossed paths over the years? We met last week, long after Carter went missing. Right. Right, right, right. So you said. Still, though, on a hunch, I wanted to check the FBI file on her and I found that it had been mysteriously erased off the server. Stick it into any FBI computer. It'll do the rest. Mayfair :  We've just been hacked. Our entire server was compromised. Could be... could be just a coincidence. So we had Donna's movements tracked using the GPS in her phone Oscar : I need you to install this in your team's vehicle. A GPS tracker, so we can keep tabs on your whereabouts. See, what I think happened  is this first location, that's where you killed Carter, and then you drove all the way over here with Donna to bury her. So I took a team to that second location. It did not take them very long to find a freshly-dug grave and the body of Tom Carter. I've never been to either of these places. Your vehicle's electronic control unit disagrees. Then the ECU is wrong. There must be a mistake in the checkout log. Okay... okay. These numbers, they look familiar to you? No, but they're formatted like, um... inmate ID numbers. Yeah, we found that in Carter's pocket. That is every convicted murderer in Guerrero's cell block, your suggestions for possible hit men. I've never seen that note before. There's an imperfection in the pen's flow. I don't know if you see that, we blew it up for you. There's a crack in the ballpoint there, and it happens to be an exact match from a pen we took from your office. I need you to swap Mayfair's pen. I know what you're thinking. Yeah, yeah. It's the exact same thing I was thinking. You get yourself a $1,000-an-hour defense attorney,  he drives hairpin turns through these cones, dismisses most of it as circumstantial. But then I went back and I thought, what is the most basic building block of any criminal investigation? Follow the money. Donna was blackmailing you... we searched her apartment and we found the cash that you gave her, $48,345. The exact same amount you withdrew from your account just days earlier. That's all I have. $48,345. Bethany, thank you. Your fingerprints are on the bills, Bethany. There is not a lawyer in the land who can get you out of this. So... you go ahead and you call a lawyer, and you ask for that plea deal,  because life without parole is the best that you're gonna get.
