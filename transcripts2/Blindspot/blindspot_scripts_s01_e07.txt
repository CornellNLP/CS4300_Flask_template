 Previously on "Blindspot"... 
 Mayfair : It's a Navy SEAL tattoo. 
 If she was Navy, she'd be in our database. 
 Not if she was special ops. 
 Jane : Something happened last night with Weller. 
 Borden : Your relationship with Agent Weller is complicated. 
 Maybe you need to establish clearer boundaries. 
 I think we need to consider you stepping down as lead agent on this case. 
 It's not necessary. 
 Patterson : Saul Guerrero, his case number is on Jane's body. 
 I've been digging through his file, but it's pretty redacted. 
 Talk to Mayfair. 
 I did, she won't help. 
 If that girl has information about Daylight on her body, then we are in very serious trouble. 
 Jane : It was a dream. 
 Borden : A s*x dream. 
 So, who do you think he was, this dream man? 
 Jane : That guy had a tattoo of a tree on his arm, and Weller doesn't have that. 
 (digging) 
 Okay. 
 If the wrong people find it... 
 The right people will. 
 How can you be sure? 
 Because I have to be. 
 Have you seen my keys? 
 Does that look like a bridge to you? 
 No, it's a tunnel. 
 I swear that I put them on the table. 
 No, it's definitely a bridge. 
 Check... check under my gym bag. 
 Yes! 
 Okay, I gotta go. 
 I know I've seen this before. 
 Are you okay to lock up? 
 I should have my own key. 
 Hmm? 
 Well, I sleep here every night. 
 We basically already live together. 
 Shouldn't we... make it official? 
 Uh... 
 Now, listen, before you freak out... 
 No, I'm not freaking out, I'm totally not freaking out. 
 I just... you know, the landlord is... the worst. 
 And the hot water situation, and there's only one bedroom. 
 I don't need my own room. 
 I just... I'm... I'm... I'm messy. 
 No, you're not. 
 I... (groans) 
 Most of my stuff is already here. 
 All my plants are dead, I haven't been back to my apartment in over a month. 
 But you love your apartment. 
 I like my apartment. 
 I love you. 
 (sighing) Oh, man. 
 Do you wanna talk about this later? 
 I do, I do. 
 I would like to talk about this later. 
 Not never. 
 Later. Later today. 
 Yes, later today. Just later. 
 I love talks, I love 'em. 
 Just, uh, looking forward to it. 
 Mmm. 
 Is there a reason you're waving Patterson off this case? 
 This is a sensitive file. 
 And Guerrero's file number is tattooed on Jane's body. 
 So, if there is a connection, we need to follow that lead now. 
 What aren't you telling me? 
 (clears throat) 
 For a decade, Saul Guerrero was a confidential informant. 
 I was his handler. 
 Why is this the first time I've heard about that? 
 Guerrero was upper echelon. 
 He had critical, otherwise unobtainable intel. 
 His tips got us warrants for wire taps, seizures, you name it. 
 So, what happened? 
 The 'Ndrangheta started making moves on the boroughs. 
 Guerrero didn't wanna play nice with them, so he started playing games with us. 
 Had us chasing our tails while he piled up bodies. 
 You had to know you were playing with fire. 
 Soon as I figured out we couldn't trust the intel, we tried to shut him down, indict him. 
 But there was a leak. 
 Guerrero went dark, and no one's heard from him in over two years. 
 It's redacted because our involvement with Guerrero is a major embarrassment upstairs. 
 I can't have Patterson shaking that tree. 
 I understand, but this is the only direct FBI case on Jane's body. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Looks like Patterson got another tattoo lead. 
 What do you got? 
 At first, all I could see was this turtle shell. 
 But then I realized the patterns were less scute-like and more coral-like. 
 It's a Petoskey stone, which is the official state stone of Michigan. 
 Go, blue! 
 You guys know I still hold the record... 
 Record for most consecutive games with a catch? 
 No, you've never mentioned that. 
 Patterson : Looking closer, one of the stone's coral patterns is very purposely shaped like Alpena County. 
 And the Alpena pattern contains an address in an unincorporated community in Draclyn Township. 
 (groans) 
 What's the problem? 
 Mayfair : Draclyn's the problem. 
 It sits along the old Detroit-Mackinac oil pipeline. 
 Ten years ago they were on the brink of ruin when a flood of cash saved the community. 
 We always suspected illegal arms dealing but we could never prove it. 
 I don't understand. If they're running guns, why don't we just arrest them? 
 Draclyn has strong ties to Michigan secessionist groups. They're off the grid. 
 Anti-government, anti-law enforcement. 
 Which makes policing Draclyn a nightmare. 
 So, how do we get in there? 
 Peacefully. 
 If we dig up a cold case that the town cares about and use it as a pretense to investigate the address, that shouldn't ring too many alarm bells. 
 Works for me. 
 I'll call the sheriff, let him know you're coming. 
 I'll dig something up, send it to you on the plane. 
 Thanks. 
 Sorry, a... plane? 
 (plane rattling) 
 So, I guess you weren't a fan of flying in your past life, huh? 
 No, I guess not. 
 (plane rattling, Jane gasping) 
 It's okay, a doctor once told me that turbulence can't take down a flight. 
 Well, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if a pilot told you that. 
 How's Patterson doing with that cold case cover story? 
 She just sent us the uplink. 
 That'll work. 
 Kurt Weller, FBI. 
 Paul Bolton, county sheriff. 
 I understand you folks are looking to head into Draclyn. 
 You sure you wanna do that? 
 We're taking over a cold case. 
 We thought you might appreciate some fresh eyes on the Mark Wyman investigation. 
 Mark Wyman was killed four and a half years ago. 
 You really expect me to believe the FBI suddenly cares about him now? 
 Well, some new evidence has come to light. 
 If it can help the community here have some peace of mind... 
 Listen. 
 This is not a safe place. 
 These people don't recognize your authority and they don't respect you. 
 They're aggressive, and you know as well as I do they're armed. 
 I've seen it get real ugly, real quick. 
 Hell, I don't even go into Draclyn if I can help it. 
 We appreciate the heads-up. 
 How many bars you got? 
 One. 
 It's only gonna get worse the further in you go. 
 Cell towers kept getting torn down and sold for parts when the township was in dire straits. 
 Eventually the phone companies got smart, stayed away. 
 We'll take our chances. 
 Call Mayfair, tell her we're off the grid. 
 (sighs) 
 We've got trouble. 
 3196... this is it. 
 Weller : Excuse me, sir. 
 My name is Kurt Weller, I'm an agent with the FBI. 
 Is this your residence? 
 Sir, I'm talking to you. Do you live here? 
 Well, I'm not the gardener, if that's what you're asking. 
 Show me your hands. 
 Get on your knees. 
 Don't you move. Don't move! 
 Whoa, whoa, what's happening? 
 Saul Guerrero, you're under arrest. 
 ♪ 
 So, which is it, hands up, down on the ground, or don't move? 
 Get down on your knees, put your hands on your head, and don't move. 
 Who's Saul Guerrero? 
 Zapata : This man is number two on the FBI's Most Wanted List. 
 We got RICO warrants out on him for 19 murders. 
 Alleged murders. 
 Reade : Terrorized New York for over 20 years. 
 (handcuffs snapping) 
 So, this is where you've been the whole time? 
 Oh, I love it here. 
 Fresh air, starry skies, friendly neighbors. 
 The illegal arms. It was you. 
 What'd you do, buy yourself some protection? 
 The people here have very strict instructions not to let anyone take me away. 
 Inside. 
 Get inside. 
 Stop. Turn around. 
 You got any weapons on you? 
 Clear. 
 Any of you see a landline? 
 Landline? Who am I gonna call? 
 (laughing) 
 Sit down. 
 Kurt. 
 Huh? 
 Place looks really clean. 
 No guns, no drugs, no cash anywhere. 
 Something's not right. It's too easy. 
 Do a final sweep, check everything, all right? 
 Then we'll move. 
 Do you know me? 
 Have we met before? 
 Oh, I think I'd remember you. 
 (car doors closing, tires screeching) 
 Someone slashed the tires. 
 Our long arms and vests are gone. 
 It's okay, we can drive out on the rims. 
 Fuel line's cut too. 
 We're not going anywhere in this thing. 
 That's your play? 
 Get someone to try and stop us? 
 You're not getting out of Draclyn alive. 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 Hey. 
 Hey, listen. 
 I'm... I'm sorry about this morning. 
 I just... I... I was kinda taken by... 
 I love you. 
 And of course, I love you, it's just,  this is good, this is really, really good. 
 So why mess it up? 
 Hey, can I talk? 
 No, just... not yet. 
 Everyone that's moved in moves out within six months. 
 And if you don't move in, then you can't move out. 
 And I know that's ridiculous and it doesn't make a ton of sense, but... 
 It's not a tunnel, it's an arch. 
 "It's not a tunnel, it's an..." 
 Sorry, is that a metaphor? 
 No, it's... it's an arch. 
 It's a literal arch. 
 What? 
 I figured out the tattoo. It's an arch. Ask me where I'm standing right now. Think New York history, your hood. The Brooklyn Historical Society. Yeah, and there's another clue. Come meet me, we'll figure out the next part of the puzzle together. Wait, you're there? David! No, no, no, no, no. You have to go home, you can't be there. I'll... I'll have the team follow up tomorrow. Nah, I'm here now, I'm gonna try to figure it out. David, don't. I'll let you know when I solve it. (sighs) Damn it. Guerrero : I have to admit, I never thought the FBI would come to Draclyn. Reade : Life's full of surprises. If you don't mind my asking, how exactly did you find me? Just to be clear... you have the right to remain silent. It's a long walk. Yeah, whose fault is that? Oh, cheer up,  mamacita. A little fresh air won't kill you. (laughing) The looks on your faces when I turned around. You had no idea what you were walking into. What about you, painted lady, huh? Tell me how you found me and I'll let you live. We found you. What do you care how? Weller : Jane. I just want to know who to kill around here. Nobody outside Draclyn knows where I am. Someone out there knew exactly where you were. Weller : Jane, enough. (twigs snapping) Get down! (gunfire) Weller : Get down! Aah! man on radio : Stand down! Stand down! Backup is on the way. Do you copy? (static) I'm gonna grab that radio. All right, we gotta get off this road. Which way are they coming from, which way do we go? I don't know but we can't stay here and we can't go back. The trees are our best bet. That way. No way. What if it's a trap? It's not a trap, it's a beacon. Reade : You don't know that. Following your tattoos got us here and got us shot at. The tattoos led to Guerrero. Why send us out here just to kill us? How'd they know we'd be in this exact spot at this exact moment to see the derricks? Weller : They didn't. The derricks are above the tree line. You can see 'em from a lot of places. Whoever did this wants us to get out of here alive, with Guerrero. Reade : And going to the oil derricks brings us farther in, not out. Zapata, back me up here. It's not my call. Well, it's damn sure not her call. This road is compromised. So, we follow the tattoos. Turn around. Walk. (door creaks) All right. We're here. Now, what? Jane : I... I don't know. I thought that there would be something here. Maybe there's a clue hidden in the graffiti. What is this, a scavenger hunt? Hey. Shut up. Weller : Check all the tags on the wall. See if any of 'em line up with Jane's. (stomping) Hey, do you hear that? Weller : Sounds hollow. These floorboards are newer than the other ones. (straining) Tasha, bring your cuffs? Yeah. (grunts) How much you make as an FBI agent? 50? 80? You really wanna die for 80-grand a year? Well, maybe I shouldn't be talking to the brawn of the operation. Who's got the brains around here? You... how much do the FBI pay you? (grunting) Weller : So... Got a four-letter alphabet lock. Anyone got an idea? Why don't we try "JANE"? No... we gave her that name. Try "SHAW." Try "DEAD." Zapata : Kurt. What? No. "KURT." Try K-U-R-T. Why would it be "KURT"? Because the tattoo of Kurt's name is right below the oil derricks on my back. (snap) Go. There's a map. Wait... Hey, there's something underneath. Got it? What is all that doing here? It's our way out. Weller : All right. So, whoever left us this box full of guns also left water and head lamps, which means this might drag on into the night. Can't drink that water. You think they laced it? Why even take the chance? Weller : They also drew a map inside the lid complete with an "X" marks the spot. So, let's go. Weller : No, not yet. We've got the high ground. So, we hold tight and wait till nightfall. Then we move to that "X." Wait, you're not blindly following a bunch of riddles in her tattoos? And you don't even know who put them on her body? man on radio : They're at the oil derricks. man 2 : Hey, stay off the radio, man! Zapata : They tracked us through the woods? Weller : No. They're tracking him. How? I thought you frisked him. Stand up. I did. But not for a tracker. What do you got? It might be in his watch. Then look. Weller... No, Jane! Don't smash it. They don't know we found it. All right... we're splitting up. I'll draw the gunmen away, then I'll drop this tracker. I'll meet you guys at the rendezvous point. You're not going alone. I'll go too. Take me with you. Zapata. You're with me. Come on, let's get going. Oh, my God! David! You can't have this outside my apartment. I'm not even supposed to have this  inside  my apartment. I know, I just needed to make sure this was the right spot. Does 708 mean anything to you? No, let's go. Look, look. The bricks along the top of the real arch are totally bare. David, I am serious. You have to stop. Okay, but the bricks in the tattoo arch have Roman numerals etched into them, see? D-C-C-V-I-I-I. 708. Now, I tried the Dewey Decimal System but that was a dead end. I know what you're doing... 700 brings you to the arts, 708 is museums, galleries, and private collections. I mean, unless we're supposed to check every book in the entire section. What if it's... What if it's an ISBN? Every book in the world has its own unique International Standard Book Number. True, but ISBNs are 13 digits. Right. So... What if it's not 708? What if we... we break the numerals into their individual letter values? 500, 100, 100, five. One, one, one. That's 13 digits. Okay. (computer chirping) Hmm, I really thought we had it. Wait... ISBNs were only ten-digit numbers before 2007, so what if the book we're looking for is older? I'm gonna try it without the last three digits. (beep) Got it. "Faculty Decisions, 1787 to 1792." 
 
 Okay. Here it is. Can you reach it? Yeah. 'Cause you're tall. Yeah. So, assuming that you're right, and I assume that you are, what are the three leftover numbers? Page number. Turn to 111. (gasps) Look! Someone circled a bunch of random letters. It's a secret code. Hey. Hold up. We can drop the tracker off soon, but we gotta slow down. They're right on us. Guerrero wouldn't run. If we move too fast, they'll know that we don't have him with us. You volunteered for it. So did Jane. But I trust your training. Jane's still a wild card. Is that really why I'm here and she's not? You got something to say, just say it. You're protecting her. She's more than just an FBI asset to you. It is one thing if you won't admit it. It is something else if you don't even know it. What could you possibly be hoping to find this far into the forest? Reade : He's got a point, we could be chasing our tails. No, the landmarks on the map have all been right so far. The sun's low. We head west, follow the light, the rendezvous point should be just around this next bend. Reade : I hope you're right. She's right. It's just up ahead. I saw the map. This is my backyard. I know where we're going. Move. They're headed for the old ranger station. Let's go! Radio's busted. Do you see anything or do we have to tear this place apart? The anticipation is killing me. You know what, your little play-by-play ain't helping. Here... this map. I recognize the topography. You sure? Trust me. I know my own tattoos. Mmm! I was wondering when those tattoos would lead us to the treasure. Lay this map over the back of my calf. It's an exact match. Only there's a red "X" on your calf that isn't on the map. Still think we're being led into a trap? There's only one way to find out. (stream gurgling) (blows) Let 'em follow that for a while. Now we can run to the RV point. I'll beat you there. Down! Down! (gunfire) (grunts) (grunts) Clear on my side. Clear. Is that all they got? (grunts) Why'd they peel off like that? 'Cause they saw that we haven't got Guerrero. Let's get to Reade and Jane... move. Guerrero : You realize you're going deeper into the forest? That sign isn't a suggestion. Back in the '70s, the U.S. government buried nuclear waste in an old mine somewhere back here. Unless you wanna glow in the dark, I suggest you turn around. Remember when I said it was a trap? If they wanted to kill us, why help us at all? You really think it's smart to leave the ranger station? How are mamacita and the Boy Scout supposed to find us? Though... I suppose it doesn't really matter, since by now they're probably dead. They're alive. I saw the look on your face when Kurt didn't pick you to go with him. (laughs) Actually, I hope he's still alive. That way, you can watch while I cut off his head. I'll be sure to do it nice and slow. Uhh! Jane, Jane! You need me alive! The FBI needs you alive. Hey, hey, all right, that's enough. Calm down, okay? Go take a walk. I'll pretend I didn't see anything. He's alive. Get up. - (phone line ringing) Bolton. Sheriff, this is Assistant Director Mayfair, FBI. I know my team's comms are out, but I'm curious about the situation up there. Uh, the situation's all good. I just spoke with your guys. They're kicking the tires of that cold case of theirs. Do me a favor and have them check in as soon as they can. I'll take care of it. Hey, Reade, I think I found that little red "X." What, no quip? We just might make it out of here. You know how to fly this thing? Nope, but I got a feeling you can. Didn't you see my on the plane? Doesn't matter, just fire it up, Jane. I don't know. Even if I could start it, let alone fly it, if someone hears... Weller and Zapata are heading to the ranger station. We should double back and wait for them. You're right. All right, let's go. You twist your lips when you're writing. I twist my lips when I'm frustrated. Is this a code or is this a cipher? My code-breaking software is so much faster than we are. I should get this back to the lab. Hey, come on, your software can't stand in that arch and compare the bricks. And it can't pull this book off the top shelf and flip to the right page. We're close here. You just wanna solve it. Damn right, I wanna solve it. So do you. I can do this here. You know why it didn't work out with those other guys? Because it didn't. That's... whoo! Insightful. Hey, just because it hasn't worked out in the past doesn't mean it can't work out in the future. Sometimes you gotta take a leap. I'm just not built that way. I know. But I am. What a fine-balanced couple we make. (both laugh) Where's Patterson? I don't know, she's been gone for a while. Guerrero : You blew it. You had a chance to get out and you came back for your friends. Reade : Is that what this is about? You never had any friends? You think they'd do the same for you? I know they would. Oh, really? You really think you can trust them? The FBI... they're using you. You're just a map for them to follow. You don't know what you're talking about. I know your name's not Jane. I know you don't know what your tattoos mean or who gave them to you. And I know I'm not the only prisoner on this little hike today. It's over, Guerrero. You can't talk your way out of this one. Sooner or later, we all face what we've done. (gunfire) Gah! Cover! Uhh! Wait a second. Look at this. We've been so focused on the pencil marks, we weren't looking at the rest of the page. Look. David : It's eraser marks. Yeah, they're faint but you can see them. Do you know what this means? That this... this isn't the only code that's been in this book. Exactly... just the most recent one. Someone is using this as a communication device. Like... like a shared Google doc. Yes. You read the message, erase it, and then you write the reply. That's it. Listen. I... (laughs) I've just been thinking about it so, so much. And I don't want you to freak out. But I think that you should probably move in. I don't know, I feel like you make some really solid points. I do? Yeah. Oh. Yeah. What the hell is going on here? (sighs) Uh, I'm... I'm so sorry. I... How did you find me? I'm FBI, that's how. Who is he and what is he doing with that photo? Jane : Let me see. I told you, you care too much. (gunfire) How many of them are out there? I wanna say all of them. Gah! (gunfire) Uhh! Uhh! Reade : Weller and Zapata have been out there a long time. Aah! Reade! Reade! Are you all right? I'm good. I'll live. He got me in the plates. (gunfire continues) They do know you're in here, right? They're very enthusiastic. How do you feel about holding down the fort? Jane, you can't go back out there. I can run a flight, cut down the guys with heavy guns. It's our only shot. If Weller and Zapata aren't coming... They're coming. Jane! I got your cover. Uhh! (gunshot) Aah! (gunfire continues) Uhh! (grunts) You okay? Yeah, you? Weller : Reade? Reade! Reade : Yeah? Guerrero alive? Reade : Well, damn, I thought you were worried about me for a second, but yeah, he's alive, we're coming out. Good. Drop all your guns and give me Guerrero! We can't do that. I will kill her right now! I don't have a shot. Neither do I. Keep going out. Hand him over, or she's gonna die! Just kill her already! Shut up. You're not going anywhere. Your best option is to drop that gun. No one else needs to die. (gunshot) Oh! Jane : Come on. You need to get him out of Draclyn. This isn't what I pay you for! Bolton : Too many of us have died today. We're not your militia anymore. You took advantage of us. You were either with him or against him. Well, we're not with you anymore. You understand this is all over for you, Sheriff. This place is about to be swarmed with FBI. I know. But more men are on their way. I'll hold them off as best I can. You have to leave now. Like we haven't been trying to do that all day? We haven't tried the helicopter. ♪ Give me the gun. Take it. I... I don't know what to do. Come on, you got us this far. Why else would it be here? I don't know. I don't know. They're getting closer. They're getting closer. Weller : Come on, Jane. If you can fly this thing, take off, now. (propellers whirring) (engine revving) Go! (gunfire) (plane rattling) When we were separated in the woods, I... I kept thinking about you... and me and Taylor Shaw. We're in this together. (plane rattling) (gasping) How can you fly a chopper out of a combat zone... and still be scared of a little turbulence? I think it's got something to do with being in control. Mayfair : Do you have any idea how dangerous your actions were? Those tattoos are not some Sunday morning crossword puzzle. They contain extremely sensitive, classified intelligence, all of which have led us to volatile criminal activity. You put the case, yourself, and a civilian at great risk. I know, I... we were just trying to solve the... (scoffs) I screwed up. I'm so sorry. Is David in trouble? He's in holding. I had to vet him to assess his threat level. He's not a threat. That's not for you to decide. Oh, my God. Am I about to be fired? Everyone gets one mistake. One. This one is yours. (people applauding) woman : Yeah! It's really him. I want you to go in there. Why me? You have the relationship. He went dark on me for a reason. We have a lot of bad blood. I just pulled him out from under a rock and dragged him through hell. That is bad blood. Trust me, I know Guerrero. I'm the last person he wants to see right now. He'll either start playing games or shut down, and we'll lose our chance to get the information. You were his handler. It has to be you. I am so sorry. (stammering) They didn't fire you, did they? No, no. Close, but... no. You were right, okay? I just... I got caught up in everything. No, me too. Me too. Can I... am I under arrest? No. No, you're free to go. (sighing) Well... I think it's time we open that Blanton's your uncle gave you. I... I can't do this. You... I know you're different. Um, but I'm still the same. And I'm the reason that they move out. And this job... I love this job. But it takes all of me. And I can't be... Happy? (sighs) Distracted. (sighs) Well, I'll, uh... I'll leave you to it. (door sliding open) Mayfair :  Did you really think we wouldn't find you? Why don't you catch me up on the last two years? Who tipped you off about the indictment? All right. Who knew you were in Draclyn? Someone outside of the township had to know. Why would I talk to you? Because I'm an assistant director at the FBI now, Saul. I'm your only shot at a deal. Murder. Conspiracy to commit murder. Conspiracy to commit extortion. Narcotics distribution. Tell me what I want to know, and I'll talk to the federal prosecutor. I'm a lot of things. But I'm not a rat. I have nothing to say. We've waited this long. We can wait a little longer. That wasn't the reunion I was expecting. Guerrero's always been stubborn. If he doesn't wanna talk, I can't make him talk. Guerrero's been running his mouth off all day, dissecting my team, looking for any weakness to exploit, and twisting anything that he learned to get an advantage. He didn't have a move for you in there. He's out of moves. He knows it's over. When you walked in there, there wasn't even a flicker of recognition from Guerrero. And you walked out without even trying to crack him. Listen to me... No, you listen to me. He says that he isn't a rat. I believe him. You were never his handler, were you? You've never even met him before. Kurt... What the hell is going on? Why is that case on her body? Tell me the truth. Only three people in the world know what I'm about to tell you. The truth... it's called Daylight.
