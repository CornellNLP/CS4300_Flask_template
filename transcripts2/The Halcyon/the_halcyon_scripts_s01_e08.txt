 Thank you. 
 Excuse me, do you know if a Mr. Garland works here? 
 Yes, sir. He's the manager. 
 Toby. 
 I haven't... I haven't been able to copy out all the data. 
 It's not easy keeping it in my head. 
 No, I understand. 
 But I will need it completed by tomorrow. 
 And that's not a request. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm looking for work. 
 I'm sorry. That's not possible. 
 Oh, right, you think I'm not good enough for a place like this? 
 It isn't about that. 
 It's about us, about what happened. You know that. 
 Sam, please. I've got nothing. 
 You shouldn't have come here. 
 I think you and I may have something to talk about.

 (LIFT PINGS) 
 The preparations for this evening are nearly complete. 
 Hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised. 
 What about my speech? 
 Your speech? 
 Well, I am the owner of the hotel. 
 I assume I'll be making some sort of address. 
 Yes, of course. 
 Why not ask the American to write it? 
 Apparently, he's rather popular on the wireless. 
 Sorry, it's... 
 It's work. But I thought they'd cleared you of any wrongdoing. 
 They've allowed me to continue, but they're watching me very closely. 
 Will you smile, please? 
 You have a lovely smile and I never see it any more. 
 (SIGHS) Toby. 
 Is it Mr. D'Abberville that's bothering you? 
 Yes. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Yes, it is. 
 Look, what do you really know about him? 
 Why is he here? What does he do? 
 Listen, Mr. D'Abberville is not going to try and replace your father. 
 No, no, no, I don't mean that. Lucian! 
 Will you please reassure my son? He has his doubts about you. 
 Oh, no! 
 Well, that's all right. Sometimes I have doubts about me. (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Well, Toby, what about you and I have drink and a chat later on? 
 About four o'clock? I'm sure we can find one or two things to talk about. 
 Looking good. 
 Mr. Klein, a word. 
 Despite difficult personal circumstances and a rocky start, you've excelled. 
 Which is why I'm giving you the rest of the week off. 
 I'm happy to keep working, sir. 
 I thought you might want to spend some time with your family. 
 We've managed to track them down to an internment camp outside Liverpool. 
 They're on the train to London now. 
 (SIGHS) 
 When are they arriving here? (CLEARS THROAT) 
 This evening. 
 Mr. Garland... one day I will repay you for this. 
 That's not necessary. 
 I'm just glad we could help. 
 Thank you. 
 Going soft, you are. 
 You never would've given him time off before. 
 Maybe I'm just getting caught up in the anniversary celebrations. 
 Are you coming this evening? 
 I didn't know staff were invited. 
 Apparently, I'm not as strict as I used to be. 
 You... 
 You could be my guest. 
 Well, I'd like that. Thank you. 
 Toby. Toby. 
 He's making you work for him, isn't he? 
 Toby, you need to find a way out. 
 If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be in this bloody situation! 
 I know. 
 Look, I can't change what happened, but you can't let him do this to you. 
 And who's gonna help me? You? 
 You can't do this alone. 
 Anything you tell me... will be in the strictest of confidence. 
 I am being... I am being blackmailed... by... erm, by Mr. D'Abberville. 
 What does he want? Money? 
 He wants certain classified... documents. 
 Information. 
 He's working with the Germans? 
 (SIGHS) Toby, we must inform the authorities. 
 It's... not that simple. 
 He found out about certain aspects of my private life... and who I choose to spend them with. 
 Does he have evidence? 
 I'm not sure, but he knows. 
 Well, knowing isn't everything. 
 So this is why there were leaks coming from your Admiralty department. 
 Then the authorities are out of the question. 
 You're already implicated and the word treason does lead us down a particularly ugly road. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Blackmail... relies on the recipient being too scared to act against it. 
 But you came to me. 
 I will deal with our Mr. D'Abberville. 
 No, there. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh. Hello, Mr. Garland. 
 Mr. D'Abberville. 
 I was just thinking, you've been here five months, it seems we've barely spoken. 
 Well, I always thought you rather disapproved of me. 
 Oh, disapprove is far too gentle a word. 
 I know about the blackmail. 
 I know about Toby Hamilton. 
 And if you think you can act this way without consequence in my hotel... 
 You're not going to do a thing. 
 On that you are very much mistaken. 
 I know who you are... 
 Sergeant Green. And I know what you did. 
 In the forest at Villers Cotterets. 
 Whatever information... you may think you have... 
 No, the game is over. 
 Sam. 
 The pieces are already off the board. 
 Now, if you insist on continuing, then you give me no choice but to... expose you. 
 You seem to be forgetting Toby. 
 I think we both know Toby's not gonna go to the police. 
 Lady Hamilton... 
 Lady Hamilton already believes her son has got an unreasonable vendetta against me. 
 And as for you, well, we all know what Her Ladyship thinks about Mr. Garland. 
 Whatever move you make... you lose. 
 So, swallow your pride, do nothing and stay out of my way. 
 It's only for another day. 
 You've built yourself a nice life here. 
 And for your daughter. 
 Don't let it go to waste. 
 So, what happened? 
 I'm working on it. 
 But you spoke to him? 
 It isn't a simple situation, Toby. 
 What happened? 
 Mr. D'Abberville finds himself in a position of strength. 
 The wrong move could ruin a lot of lives. 
 So you're just... you're going to do nothing? 
 No. 
 No. 
 There is still one more option. 
 Wait. When did you kiss him? 
 Can you say it a bit louder? Some of the staff didn't hear. 
 The other day after dinner. 
 That's good. Is it good? 
 It is. Sort of. 
 But it's Joe O'Hara, so... 
 It's almost as though he's deliberately holding back. 
 This has nothing to do with Freddie? 
 No. 
 Well, I don't know, maybe. 
 Hotel's on fire, you can only save one of them. Who do you choose? 
 (LAUGHS) I can't answer that. 
 You spent a long time loving Freddie. 
 That won't just disappear. 
 I've also seen the way you look at Joe. 
 And if he's serious, he'll show it. 
 That's how it is with you and Sonny? He's told you he loves you? 
 He said he felt it since the day we met. 
 And you've told him, too? 
 This isn't about me, Garland. 
 Hell, there's a war on. Choose them both! 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I need to speak to you about Mr. D'Abberville. 
 I believe he has not been entirely honest about his reasons for being here. 
 What reasons are these? His continued presence in the hotel is purely to obtain official secrets and sell them on to the Germans. (LAUGHS) 
 Is that really the best you could come up with? 
 Why do you think Toby is so suspicious of him? 
 Toby thinks Mr. D'Abberville is trying to replace his father. 
 With all due respect, does that really sound like something that would trouble Toby? 
 Why do you think Special Branch targeted the hotel? 
 Mr. D'Abberville has helped us. 
 Mr. D'Abberville is leaving. 
 Possibly today. 
 If not, tomorrow. 
 And do you have any evidence to back up these ludicrous claims? 
 Your Ladyship, no matter what you may think of me, you know I would not stand here and lie to you. 
 (LAUGHS) You've been lying to me for years! 
 Covering up for my husband. Offering me tea in the atrium while he was up here carrying on with his mistresses. 
 You forget your place, Mr. Garland. 
 You're not welcome here. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Demanded Brazil nuts. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 It's true. 
 What are you doing, Mr. O'Hara? 
 I am composing a speech for your mother. 
 Feel free to throw in your two cents. 
 No, I didn't mean about the writing, I meant about her. 
 Her being... 
 Emma. 
 We're having that conversation? 
 Yes, we are. 
 Well, then, in the politest way possible, Your Lordship, it's none of your goddamn business. 
 And what if I disagree with that? 
 Fine. I'll make it simple. Are you in love with her? 
 I refer the honourable gentleman to my previous answer. 
 If you say you are, I'll walk away. 
 You broke her heart once before. 
 Do you really think she wants to go through that again? 
 You've not answered the question. 
 That's because I'm not staff. 
 You say jump and my feet stay on the ground. 
 Or maybe you don't want to answer it because you don't want to admit the truth. 
 You step down, kid. That you love her but you know that's not enough. 
 I said step down! 
 Because you know she'll never feel the same about you. 
 Goddammit! 
 What on earth are you doing? 
 I kind of owed him that. 
 I think Mr. O'Hara objects to me being near you. 
 Oh, for goodness' sakes, both of you! 
 I'm at work. 
 Mr. O'Hara, you need to leave. 
 I guess I was all wrapped up here, anyway. 
 I'm telling you this as a manager after you struck the owner of this place. 
 That's all. 
 This isn't personal, Joe. 
 Emma... 
 Never mind. 
 Enjoy your party. 
 I've been thinking. 
 And... I could go to the police. 
 And what will you tell them? 
 That you stole from me? 
 Yes. Exactly that. 
 They don't need to know about you and me. 
 Do you realise what will happen to you? 
 I have to make things right, no matter what the cost. 
 Do you really think they'll believe you? 
 A cocktail waiter? 
 Mr. D'Abberville will deny it and you'll be laughed out of the station, a deranged fantasist. 
 
 
 
 Toby. 
 It's Mr. Hamilton. 
 And I know what you're doing. 
 You think that if you do this, that I will somehow forgive you. 
 I'm not doing this to change your mind. 
 Good. Cos it wouldn't work. 
 When I think about what we did, I'm disgusted at myself. 
 Toby, I love you. 
 How dare you say that? 
 You want to do me a favour? You want to help? Get out. 
 Disappear. 
 There is no place for you here and there never will be. 
 As you wish... 
 Mr. Hamilton. 
 I want to leave a surprise for Mr. D'Abberville. 
 Very good, Your Ladyship. 
 Thank you. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Mr. D'Abberville. 
 Thank you for being here, Toby. 
 I do realise this is a very tricky situation. 
 But at least it's... coming to an end. 
 I'm not going to help you. 
 Do you really want the world to know the truth about you? 
 Think of what it'll do to your family and, well, your life. 
 Thousands of people risk their lives every day for this country, my brother amongst them. 
 My future is nothing compared to that. 
 That's very moving. I'm sure Special Branch will be equally touched when they hear about it. 
 Well, I suppose we'll find out. 
 I've already telephoned them. 
 You stupid child. 
 You stupid child! 
 Priscilla. 
 An explanation. 
 For the tickets, the passports. 
 It's a complicated situation. 
 I didn't want to worry you. 
 Worry me? 
 It's just a bit of business I've been doing. (CHUCKLES) 
 The ticket is provisional, in case I have to attend to it at short notice. 
 And the passports, I mean, that's prudence. 
 Bearing in mind the times we're living in. 
 They say the truth and lies sound different. 
 But they don't, do they? 
 Priscilla... you're being emotional. 
 No. 
 Not yet. 
 Darling, let's just put them away. 
 Is it true about the... documents? 
 The Germans? 
 What? 
 Look, I don't know what Toby's been saying to you, but he... he has his own problems. 
 It wasn't Toby. 
 It was Garland. 
 Well, Mr. Garland isn't quite what he claims to be. 
 Come on, just give me what is mine and we'll talk. 
 Was any of it true? Any of it at all? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Answer me! 
 Look, I didn't intend... for things to move so fast. 
 But you were so starved of attention and affection, it... 
 I loved you in my own way. 
 No. No! 
 That was my way out! 
 This isn't something I'm gonna let you walk away from. 
 No, you... You put the phone down, Priscilla. Put the phone down! 
 Take your hands off me! 
 You are gonna be quiet! 
 And you are going to listen to me. 
 Now, I am walking out of here and you will not do a thing. 
 And do you know why? Because of Toby! 
 Agh! 
 Even if you continue to wilfully ignore the sordid details of your son's wretched private life... (GASPS) he's still a traitor. 
 And you know the penalty for treason. 
 And if I go down, Priscilla, that boy is going with me! 
 We will hang together by our bloody necks! 
 No! No! 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 He was very... angry. 
 (SOBS) He... he threatened my children. 
 We must keep the door locked. 
 Tell housekeeping it's off-limits. 
 Far too busy downstairs to attempt to move the body now. 
 Were you hurt? 
 (SOBS) I didn't mean to do it. I'm sorry. Please help me. 
 I'm sorry. Please. 
 I know. 
 Does anyone else know you're here? 
 Er, from housekeeping, the Irish girl. I can't... 
 I can't remember her name, but... 
 She won't be a problem. 
 But you can't remain here. 
 You must return to your room and prepare yourself for the party. 
 Oh, no, I can't possibly go to the party! 
 Your presence is expected! 
 You must not raise any suspicions. 
 You may feel nauseous. 
 Short of breath. That will pass. 
 The main thing is... to act as if everything is normal. 
 Everything is very far from normal. 
 Leave this with me, Your Ladyship. 
 Mr. Garland. 
 He said that... you're not who you claim to be. 
 I expect Mr. D'Abberville said a lot of things that have no merit. 
 Please. You need to go. 
 Why are you helping me? 
 Because you asked. 
 Thank you. 
 You ready? 
 Yes, Mr. Robbie. 
 I'm ready. 
 Papa! 
 I've been thinking about the past few months. 
 I know I can be difficult, trouble. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 If you've... If you've got regrets or want to run for the hills, I'll understand. 
 There's only one place I'm going to be and that's right by your side. 
 Good. Cos I... 
 I love you. 
 Can you say that again, please? 
 You heard me perfectly fine, Mr. Sullivan. 
 (JAZZ MUSIC) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, tonight sees 50 glorious years of the Halcyon Hotel, but, but, but... we all know a party isn't a party without Miss Betsey Day! 
 (APPLAUSE) 
 I'll send it back up. Yes, sir. 
 (SIGHS) 
 What exactly did you say to Mr. O'Hara that made him punch you? 
 I'm not so sure if it's what I said or... what was unsaid. 
 And that would be? 
 That I made a mistake... in letting you go. 
 That I love you. 
 And I want you back. 
 And what if it's too late for that now? 
 I'm fairly sure it's too late, but... 
 I couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least try. 
 (LIFT PINGS) 
 (JAZZ MUSIC AND CHATTER) 
 After you. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Hello? 
 "Mr. D'Abberville?" 
 No, it's Mr. Garland. 
 "Special Branch have arrived. 
 Apparently they're very keen to speak to Mr. D'Abberville." 
 He's not here, I'm afraid. 
 They were most insistent, said they'd received a tip-off. 
 They're already on their way up to his room. 
 Thank you, Wilfred. 
 (LIFT PINGS) 
 Gentlemen. How can I help? 
 We're looking for Mr. D'Abberville. 
 As am I. 
 He's run up quite the bill and seems to have vanished. 
 Would you mind if we check his room, just to see with our own eyes? 
 I'm afraid that's against hotel policy. 
 The privacy of our guests is of the utmost importance. 
 I wasn't really asking, Mr. Garland. 
 Ah, yes. 
 I did find... this. 
 7:30 Euston to Liverpool Lime Street. 
 We'll have someone waiting for him at the other end, just in case. 
 Sir. 
 Anything else I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask. 
 You're not a bad liar, Mr. Garland. 
 But I'm fairly certain you are hiding something. 
 Lady Hamilton was... romantically involved with Mr. D'Abberville. 
 We believe he was intent on taking a substantial sum of money from her. 
 It is, as you can imagine... a very embarrassing situation. 
 And her husband barely cold in the grave. 
 (TUTS) 
 We'll be in touch, Mr. Garland.

 The stairs have collapsed. It's bloody chaos. 
 Get everyone outside. You, too. 
 No, I want to help! 
 I will not risk you. Mr. O'Hara? 
 I'll see her out. Come on. 
 (COUGHING) 
 We need to get as many as possible out of the bar. 
 Don't worry, we'll do what we can. 
 Which way? 
 Right, come on! Round to the left! Don't stop till you get outside! Go! 
 Round to the left! Quick as you can! Don't stop till you're outside!

 Mr. Garland, my mother. 
 She's safe. I will attend to her.

 Right, get your family and yourself outside now! 
 Where are you going? There's still people trapped. 
 Wait. (SPEAKS GERMAN) 
 I'll make sure they're safe. 
 Thank you. 
 What did you say? I said these people here were family too. 
 Keep moving to the exit. 
 Quickly now!

 Go to him.

 You won't be able to get in his room!

 The bomb damage is mainly to the left wing. 
 Mr. D'Abberville's room is gone. 
 What if someone finds out what we did? 
 They won't. 
 You don't know that! 
 You're right, I don't. 
 (LOUD CRASH) 
 If we don't leave now, we'll never get out. 
 Ohh!
