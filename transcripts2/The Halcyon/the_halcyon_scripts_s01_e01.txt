 (THUNDERCLAPS) 
 Good morning, Lord Hamilton. 
 Thank you, Feldman. 
 Would you? 
 Come on. 
 Terrible weather. 
 The Royal Suite is prepared, Your Lordship. 
 Thank you, Mr. Garland. 
 You remember Miss Lambert? 
 This way, please. 
 All right. Step back. 
 Yes, Chef. 
 You know what they say. 
 Nothing good ever comes in through the back. 
 The vote of no confidence has fatally wounded Chamberlain and all indications suggest that it comes down to Halifax or Churchill now. 
 We must use our power and influence to guide this country in her time of need. 
 Churchill is an idiot. 
 Well, he sees things as black and white. 
 Lord Halifax understands the situation is more nuanced. 
 Nuanced? I was with Halifax when he met the Fuhrer. 
 Hitler thought he was a footman. He handed him his coat. 
 With all due respect, Miss Lambert, our concerns lie more with economic implications, rather than social. 
 The last war plunged our nation into a recession from which we have barely recovered. 
 All : Hear, hear! 
 Gin, please. 
 Yes, of course. 
 (PHONE RINGS IN DISTANCE) 
 Anything yet? 
 Apologies, Mr. O'Hara, but as I explained, check-in isn't until 12. 
 Should your room become available before then, I will inform you. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Well, you guys seem real busy here today. 
 I saw some serious-looking men in some serious-looking cars coming in earlier. 
 Well, sir, the Halcyon is used for a variety of meetings and business conferences. 
 Do they always come in through the back, though? 
 If... if they wish to. 
 We try to meet all guests' needs, whether it's how they enter the hotel or what time they wish to check in. 
 Oh. Well, thank you. 
 Oh... 
 One last question. This is probably the most important. What is your name? 
 Emma Garland. 
 Well, thank you for your help, Emma Garland. 
 The Fuhrer has already stated that he doesn't view Britain as the enemy. 
 Hitler also reneged on Munich. We need to exercise caution. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Surely the answer is to join with him. 
 No, that is not an option. 
 We're trying to avoid being dragged into a war, not forming an alliance. 
 You say you're men of vision but you're blind. 
 Look at how he has restored Germany's fortunes. 
 Ten years ago, they were on their knees. 
 Miss Lambert... 
 Now they tower over Europe! 
 Hitler is not afraid to take what he wants, to take a stand against this plague of itinerants. 
 Miss Lambert, your connections are very much appreciated but you will respect the authority of the chair. 
 This is not up for discussion. 
 (MURMURS OF AGREEMENT) 
 Now, may we address the matter at hand? 
 I'd like another drink, please. 
 Stay. 
 One more, thank you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Again. Mm-hm? 
 Charity... 
 Please, sir. Can I have some more? 
 Put that down! 
 She's on my side, aren't you, girl? 
 She doesn't want her job taken by some shabby little Jew, either. 
 Charity... 
 Oh, you stupid idiot! 
 Oh, I'm so sorry! 
 I think that's enough, Miss Lambert. 
 You don't tell me what to do, Lawrence, and you don't tell me what to say! 
 I shan't be kept in the shadows any more. 
 Perhaps now might be a good time to break for tea and sandwiches. 
 Gentlemen, if you could make your way to the Linton Lounge at the end of the corridor. 
 You need to have a lie-down. 
 Aren't you going to join me, Lawrence? 
 Always just standing there in the background. 
 Is that what you like, Mr. Garland? 
 To watch? 
 That's quite enough of that, now. 
 Shut up, Lawrence. 
 What were you thinking? 
 It was an accident. 
 I'm not stupid, Emma. 
 I swear - my hand just slipped. 
 You heard what she was saying. How can you stand there and listen to that? 
 Because it's the job. 
 This is Lord Hamilton's hotel and he's been very good to us. 
 Well, I suppose I'm an embarrassment as a receptionist and a daughter, then. 
 Maybe one. Not the other. 
 Go on. Back to work. 
 Good morning, Betsey. 
 Ugh! 
 Mm. 
 You're not supposed to be in here. What if I'd been someone else? 
 Someone important? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I was too tired to go home after the show. 
 Besides, a lady needs her beauty sleep. 
 I think you stopped being a lady somewhere between the seventh and eighth cocktail. 
 (CHUCKLES) I don't know how you get up in the mornings. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Housekeeping! 
 Good morning, Mrs. Hobbs. What are you doing in here? 
 A guest rang to say they'd left something behind. 
 There's no need to clean. The room is ready. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 (SNIFFS) You can tell your little whore friend that if I catch her in one of my rooms again she'll lose more than a shoe. 
 Whore? (SCOFFS) 
 Skinner. 
 Lady Hamilton. Welcome home. 
 Your Ladyship. 
 Thank you. 
 She's back. 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 (PLEASURABLE MOANING) 
 Mr. Garland, Her Ladyship's here. 
 She's not due till tomorrow. 
 Where is she now? 
 Where do you think? 
 (PHONE RINGS / PLEASURABLE MOANING) 
 (LIFT BELL TINGS) 
 Lady Hamilton? 
 I am sorry. 
 I'm afraid His Lordship has a rather nasty headache. 
 He made me promise he would not be disturbed. 
 Might I suggest you take some tea in the atrium while you wait? 
 (DOOR UNLOCKS) 
 Lady Hamilton... he really was most insistent. 
 Don't shepherd me, Mr. Garland. 
 I know where I'm going. 
 I'm your employer, not a guest. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SNIFFS) I can still smell some tart. 
 Her Ladyship's on her way. 
 Room's clear. 
 Next time I leave, it'll be through the front door. 
 Here's a better idea, Miss Lambert. 
 Consider not coming back at all. 
 The world is changing, Mr. Garland. You just don't see it. 
 His Lordship? 
 I believe His Lordship is feeling better. 
 He's having a drink in the bar. 
 Would you like me to escort you down?

 It's all the same to me, just one big noise. 
 Easy on the eye, though. 
 Bloody women. I'm getting too old for it all. 
 Probably why I'm hiding in here. 
 Joe O'Hara. 
 Lawrence Hamilton. 
 Hamilton as in...? 
 I'm not sure I know how to address a lord. 
 "Another drink, Your Lordship?" usually works for me. 
 Another bloody drink.

 The way I see it, appeasement doesn't necessarily mean acceptance or approval. 
 My point exactly. 
 It's not unpatriotic to explore options. 
 Hell, America's wanting to steer clear of the whole ball game. 
 Boys! Congratulations, Freddie. Sir Cyril phoned me himself to tell me you'd passed. 
 Somebody's got to fly those planes. 
 Don't put yourself down. They don't accept just anybody. 
 This is Mr. O'Hara. He's an American. 
 Freddie and Toby. Two of my finest achievements. 
 So, Mr. O'Hara, what do you do? 
 Well, right now I'm discovering London knows how to make a pretty good cocktail. 
 Yourself? A junior researcher at Oxford. Fairly dull, I'm afraid, as I imagine my father would be happy to tell you. 
 Oh, now, now, Toby. I'm sure you're doing important work. 
 Ahem. I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
 There's been complaints about the noise. 
 Look at you, out from behind the desk! I'm on room service. 
 Lucky me! 
 Hello, again. Mr. O'Hara. I trust you're enjoying your stay? 
 So will you be coming to my party tomorrow, then? 
 Well, I'll be working at your party. 
 Well, that counts. 
 (SONG ENDS AND APPLAUSE) 
 I'm afraid that's all you're getting tonight. 
 On behalf of the Sonny Sullivan band, I'd like to say thank you. 
 You make a girl giddy. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 I should be heading for bed as well. 
 Boys, don't stay up too late. Freddie, you should be fresh for your guests tomorrow. 
 Toby. 
 So what's he done now? 
 I'm afraid there are no suites available, but we do have some superior rooms. 
 I suppose it'll have to do. Anything for a bit of peace and bloody quiet. 
 It was rather a close call today. 
 It's what you're here for, Richard. 
 You keep my secrets, I keep yours. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Come. 
 The boys have just arrived, Your Ladyship. They're with their father. 
 I'll see them in the morning. 
 What are your plans, Emma? 
 For life? 
 I don't know. I... haven't really thought about it. 
 Just the usual things, I suppose. 
 Get married, have children. 
 Become a fat little housewife in a dreary little house somewhere. 
 You don't need to. 
 They'll tell you it's life. They'll tell you it's growing up. 
 But it's not. 
 Is there anything else I can do for Your Ladyship? 
 Goodnight, Emma. 
 Come with me. 
 Where are we going? 
 Where do you think we're going? 
 ♪ Da, dah-dah da ♪ 
♪ Dah-dah da ♪ 
♪ Ba-da, bah-dah ♪ 
♪ Bah, dah, da Doo-do, do-doo... ♪ 
 Enjoying yourself, are you? Bloody hell! Don't they teach you to knock? 
 How did you get in here? 
 You're the chanteuse. What's your name? 
 Betsey. You're not going to have me sacked, are you? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Lucky for you, Betsey, I've had a very long day and I would like to avoid any further drama. 
 You know your trouble, sir? 
 Enlighten me. 
 You complicate matters. Carrying on with that Lambert woman for a start. 
 How do you know about that? 
 She's the talk of the hotel. 
 What does your wife think about her? 
 My wife and I have an understanding. 
 Or so you think. 
 You can't please all of them all of the time, sir. 
 Sooner or later, it will all come crashing down. 
 Yes, you may have a point there. 
 Give me a towel, then. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 God! I've not been down here in ages. 
 They're going to make it into a bomb shelter. 
 Are things really that serious? 
 It would seem so. 
 Aha! Oh, I'd forgotten we'd done this. 
 Toby started crying. 
 Yes, because you told him that the police were going to arrest him for vandalism. 
 And look at us now. Pilot Officer Freddie Hamilton. 
 It was strange, going through training. 
 Flying a Spitfire for the first time. 
 But it wasn't until I put on the uniform that I realised that... 
 You're a real pilot? (CHUCKLING) 
 No, I was going to say that I look good in uniform but your one sounded a lot better. 
 Not everyone looks good in uniform. 
 You're not bad, I suppose. 
 I've seen worse. 
 I'd better... 
 Get back to work, yes. 
 I'll see you later. 
 
 
 
 I think you've been reading too many fairy tales. 
 I'm serious. 
 There was this big pause and for a second it was as though something was going to happen. 
 So why didn't it? 
 Hey! 
 What! No, we've been friends since we were little. 
 It's not like that. 
 I'll tell you what I told His Lordship. 
 You complicate matters. 
 And you told His Lordship this when, exactly? 
 When he caught me in his bath. 
 Please tell me you're joking. 
 He's actually very sweet. A proper gentleman. 
 Your old man's not coming, is he? 
 Mr. Feldman, every day your poker corner gets mopped and scrubbed. 
 It's even on the cleaning schedule. 
 Oh! It's no fun if it's not secret. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Try not to spill any drinks, Emma. 
 (LAUGHTER AND JEERING) 
 Billy, you're smoking your stake. 
 Oh... He was going to lose it anyway. 
 No, I wasn't. I've got three jacks here. 
 Billy! 
 (GROANING) 
 Billy! 
 Honestly! 
 I've never even thought of Freddie that way. 
 I mean, not really. 
 Probably for the best, then. 
 Because he's His Lordship's heir and you're just the girl behind reception. 
 Enjoy the walk, Billy. 
 Off you go. 
 (LOW CONVERSATION) 
 Lady Hamilton, I have the menus for the party tonight, you requested Thank you, Emma. 
 I'll let you know if there's anything amiss. 
 Yes, thank you, Emma. 
 It seems as if the Dutch are on high alert, fearing invasion. 
 Please, no politics at the table. 
 I'm sorry, Miss Lambert. The restaurant is closed to non-residents until evening. 
 We both know that's a lie. 
 Don't worry. His Lordship will be pleased to see me. 
 He always is. 
 Please. Don't do this. 
 What's she doing here? 
 Lawrence! 
 I have no idea. 
 Mother, shall we go for a walk? 
 Under cover of darkness is one thing. 
 But I will not be humiliated like this in front of my children. Do you hear? 
 So, this policy of appeasement you support - how's that working for you? 
 When you decide to do something useful with your pathetic little life, then you can criticise me: and not before. 
 Lawrence! 
 Lawrence. Lawrence! Wait! 
 I'm coming with you to the house. 
 I have asked you to be discreet. This is not discreet. 
 I have waited. I have listened to your promises. 
 I have done everything you have asked. 
 Now is the time to choose. Do you want me or not, Lawrence? 
 We'll... discuss this elsewhere. 
 I'm thinking, we get a long enough lead for the microphone, all the way down here - it might work. 
 Help me up, then. 
 Why do you want to sing on the bar? 
 Because it's show business, Sonny Sullivan. 
 Keep 'em watching. Keep 'em on their toes. 
 Mm! 
 It's never going to happen, Sonny. 
 Just you wait. 
 (LIGHTER CLICKING) 
 Here - let me. 
 That was quite the scene in there. 
 I saw you standing up to your old man. 
 That takes some guts. 
 I was stupid to even try. He never listens to me. 
 Freddie, maybe, but... 
 Why would you think that? 
 Because Freddie's the heir by virtue of the fact that he was born four minutes before me. 
 And those four minutes count for a lot, right? 
 Who's that woman who came in? 
 Charity Lambert, his... His...? 
 Fancy lady. 
 There've been others, believe me, but she's the worst and I doubt she comes cheap. 
 Well, I hate to say it but she is kind of a knockout. 
 Yeah - sure. Blond hair, blue eyes... 
 No wonder the Germans love her. 
 The Germans? 
 Has she spent some time over there? 
 In Munich. 
 I believe she made a lot of very influential friends, as it were. 
 Well, I don't know how things work over here but the way I see it, your dad had no right snapping at you like that. 
 Well, at least somebody's on my side. 
 Hell, I'll even buy you a drink. Come on. 
 You look like you could use one. 
 It's possibly a bit early in the day for it. 
 Well, like they say... it's five o'clock somewhere, right? 
 Your Ladyship. What can I do for you? 
 How long is it since your wife died? 
 Ten years. 
 I was surprised when my husband appointed you. 
 You seem a man of limited worth. 
 I supposed you've served him well. 
 Everything I do is in service to your family. 
 You included. 
 In that case... 
 I require a list of all the women with whom my husband has fraternised behind my back, every sordid little story that you've helped to hide. 
 Your husband loves you very much. 
 Don't patronise me. 
 You're right. I apologise. 
 But don't ask me to pick sides, Lady Hamilton, because you won't win. 
 I wish I respected you. 
 But I can't. If it were up to me, you'd be out of a job. 
 Then I'm very happy it is not up to you. 
 Thank you, Mr. Garland. 
 I shan't forget that. 
 I feel for the son. He's a good kid. 
 "Yeah. You're all heart, Joe. 
 Stand by. In five, four, three..." 
 (THEME MUSIC) 
 Good morning, America! 
 This is Joe O'Hara, live for CBA, reporting from London, where the spectre of fascism haunts the capital's West End. 
 I'm staying at the luxurious Halcyon Hotel, where I can reveal prominent businessmen, aristocrats and politicians met this week in secret to discuss a deal with none other than Adolf Hitler himself. 
 You should prepare for the worst. 
 This broadcast is your fault. You were meant to keep on top of things. 
 You brought your mistress to your own hotel. 
 What did you think would happen? Don't you take that tone with me! 
 When I think of what I've done for you, where you would have been without me... 
 I am grateful. 
 I don't want your bloody gratitude. 
 You are meant to protect me. 
 Please. Whatever it takes. Help me on this, Richard. 
 The broadcast only goes out to America and we have people at most of the papers who reassure me they won't be running with this. 
 Most? 
 There's a new editor at the Telegraph,  Mr. Briggs. 
 And we don't know him? 
 No. 
 He's going to run the story? 
 Nazi shame at the Halcyon: Lord Hamilton, Miss Lambert, a gripping mix of fact and fiction, mostly fiction. 
 Sells papers, though. 
 Please send Mr. Briggs a most gracious invite to Freddie's party this evening. 
 And fetch me my address book, will you? I have calls to make. 
 You're excused. 
 Would you like some help? 
 No, no. 
 You heard about the radio broadcast, then? 
 That bloody American. 
 What are you going to do? 
 Well, we have guests coming tonight. 
 Friends of Mother and Father. VIPs. 
 I will do what I've been brought up to do. I'll smile. 
 I'll be polite. 
 And pretend nothing is ever wrong. 
 Stay still. 
 I am staying still. 
 (BELL TINGS) 
 I er... I'll see you at the party. 
 Yes. 
 Freddie! 
 Hello! 
 Hello. Good to see you. How are you? 
 Mr. Briggs is en route. 
 Thank you, Mr. Feldman. 
 I don't suppose you know where Wellington is? 
 You've lost His Lordship's dog? 
 Well, I... I ain't lost him. I just don't know where he is, Skinner. 
 You might as well leave the country, Billy. 
 Don't say that. 
 That's like losing a member of their family. 
 Capital offence. 
 Mr. Briggs. 
 Mr. Garland. 
 I'm so glad you accepted our invitation. 
 I was intrigued. 
 Let me show you around. 
 Can you help me with these damn cufflinks? 
 (SIGHS) How did we do it? 
 What's that? 
 How did we live like this for so long? 
 Pretending it's fine when everything's falling apart. 
 Oh, Priscilla! 
 You were so handsome. We were so young. 
 And I loved you... so, so much. 
 We won't tell the boys until tomorrow. 
 What? 
 Tonight, I want you at my side and thereafter I shall stay in the country. 
 And you can do as you please. 
 I... I can make things better. 
 No, Lawrence, you can't. 
 This marriage is over. 
 I hear we're going to be front-page news tomorrow. 
 You know you're the only paper running the story? 
 Our readers deserve the truth. 
 Have you ever tried the lobster at the Savoy? 
 I'm not sure that I have. 
 Oh, you have. 
 February 4th of this year. 
 You see, like you, it's my job to know things, too. 
 For example, I know why you booked a room there for one night only. 
 I know the name of the girl who visited you for an hour and a half at 9:35pm. 
 I also know that you ordered the Lobster de la Manche. 
 Are you trying to blackmail me? 
 No, Mr. Briggs. 
 I'm trying to impress you. I like you. 
 I like your paper. 
 I do hope we can be friends. 
 I like you, too. 
 That makes me very happy. 
 ♪ (UPBEAT JAZZ PLAYING) 
 Now, I believe the party awaits. 
 After you. 
 Another two. 
 Go on, Freddie! 
 (APPLAUSE) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Enter. 
 Shouldn't you be at your party? I was. 
 I wanted to speak to you. 
 All right. 
 They've cancelled leave. 
 I have to go back to base first thing tomorrow. 
 Did you know about this? Mm, well, they'll be preparing you, to send out squadrons to support the British Expeditionary Force in France. 
 So it's really happening, then. 
 Well, I'm sorry, I did my best but it looks like it will be Churchill's country now. 
 What, was there something else? 
 You have to stop. 
 You have to stop treating Mother like this. 
 Mind your tone! 
 No, I won't. 
 Carrying on in that way - you're humiliating her! 
 Don't make the same mistakes as I did. 
 I took something beautiful and I destroyed it. 
 Just because I could. 
 Go on. 
 Go down and enjoy yourself. I'll er... I'll follow you down. 
 Oh! 
 (GASPS) 
 O'Hara. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Stand up! 
 I don't want to get into this with you. 
 Stand up! 
 Freddie! 
 Freddie... Freddie, back to your party. 
 I was just doing my job. 
 What did you think would happen, Mr. O'Hara? 
 Well, the Queensberry rules, for one. 
 I guess you guys want me out of here. 
 You're still a guest and that still means something. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Freddie, you must stop disappearing. 
 (CHEERING) - Here he is! 
 Here's the man of the hour! 
 He has a wandering eye, like his father. 
 Kindly go upstairs and remind my husband this is an event to be attended by both parents.
