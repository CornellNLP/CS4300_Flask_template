 Sidney... 
 We've reached 5,000 signatures. Can you believe it? 
 Oh, he'll have tea. Not too much milk. Thank you. 
 Sydney Silverman has replied, he's backing Gary's appeal. 
 And then... there's Maxwell Fyfe. 
 You wrote to the Home Secretary? 
 Well, his wife. She was a friend of Mother's. 
 Let's just say she rules the roost in that family. 
 You didn't have to do all this. You really didn't. 
 That poor boy... 
 Deserves to have hope, don't you think? 
 We all do. 
 Without hope, where would we be? 
 You didn't forget, did you? 
 I knew there was something. 
 Never mind. 
 Three more and I've got the whole England team. 
 Hello, handsome. 
 Hello, Rita. 
 You're a sight for sore eyes. 
 Wish I could say the same. 
 It's not half as bad as it looks. 
 You had your hair cut? 
 You're going to a reporter this time, aren't you? 
 You have, haven't you? It's very dignified. 
 You don't have to say anything. All you need to do is nod your head. 
 I'll deal with the rest. 
 Do you want me to arrest your husband? 
 My babies need food on the table. They need a father. 
 They need a mother, too. 
 Just nod your head, Ri. 
 Haven't you got lovely hands? Hm? 
 He's not gonna stop until he kills you. 
 Nod your head. 
 You take care of yourself, handsome. 
 Mum thinks the appeal's going to work. 
 I know she does. 
 See all them MPs. All them signatures. 
 It won't be enough though, will it? 
 I don't think so. 
 I'm not sure any of it will be enough. 
 See, it's the waiting that does it. 
 I can hardly take it. 
 You're not gonna believe this. 
 Stanley Matthews? 
 Stanley bloody Matthews! 
 They've taken Gary's belt in case he tries to hang himself. 
 For pity's sake... 
 Is there any greater irony? 
 I can't help thinking if he hadn't been charged, there but for the grace of God, go I. 
 The whole thing's just... 
 It's a tragedy. 
 It really is. 
 There's no-one to see. 
 What do you imagine we are, Leonard? 
 We're... we're friends, aren't we? 
 Come with me to Brighton for the weekend. 
 Be bold. I know you have it in you. 
 I... I... I have Sunday Service. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. 
 I have friends. I don't need more friends. 
 Knew she wouldn't squeal. She never squeals. 
 What are we looking for? 
 Anything that will bring him in. 
 Is your dad home? 
 He said not to wake him. 
 Phil. 
 Bingo. 
 Wakey-wakey, Eddie. Rise and shine. 
 What's that bitch gone and said? 
 Watch your mouth. 
 We found your stash, Eddie. 
 That's not mine. I've never seen it before. 
 Lying b*st*rd. 
 It ain't mine! 
 You're choking me! 
 I can't breathe! I can't breathe... 
 Little b*st*rd! 
 How's that breathing now? 
 Eh? 
 Argh! 
 Eddie! What is it this time, eh? 
 Couple of rounds with the missus? 
 Gary seems bonnier, don't you think? 
 A London newspaper's gonna put him on their front page. 
 I hope it's the Daily Mail. I'm quite partial to the Daily Mail. 
 I always knew you had fascistic leanings, Mrs M. 
 I'm not sure we should be getting our hopes up. 
 The newspapers, petitions, it's all fantastic, but... 
 Don't lose faith, Mr Chambers. 
 Oh, Lord! 
 Who did this? One of you must have seen! 
 Mr Chambers is doing his duty! 
 He can no more turn his back on that poor boy than he can on you! 
 And there's a darn sight more of you deserve the cold shoulder! 
 What are you smiling at, Jack Chapman? 
 You are magnificent when you're angry, Sylvia. 
 A pansy up in Khartoum, invited a Sapphic up to his room. 
 They argued all night, as to who had the right, to do what with which and to whom! 
 You been screwing her? Hm? 
 A pansy up in Khartoum -- 
 Jesus Christ, Dicky, you must know more than that one. 
 How about the lighthouse keeper from Crighton? 
 You been screwing my wife? 
 What about it? 
 You planted them jewels so you could get me out of the way. 
 There was a lighthouse keeper from Crighton... 
 Something, something, Brighton. 
 "Something, something, something"? Shut up, you thick b*st*rd! 
 Eddie... he's been screwing your missus. 
 And everybody know it. 
 I heard you got shot. 
 I heard they was all but planning your funeral. 
 I heard you was pissing and mewling like a baby. 
 Shut your mouth, Eddie. 
 "I'm frightened, I'm frightened. Don't let me die!" 
 This was you, wasn't it? 
 If you have something to say, say it. Don't threaten me. 
 If this appeal works, where does that leave us? 
 How are we meant to find peace? 
 I'm not sure there's anything left to say. 
 Gary dictated it to me. 
 You have it in your heart to forgive, I know you do. 
 You're not the only one to lose a child, Agatha. 
 How's serving God? 
 How's playing him? 
 There you are, gents. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you busy? 
 We're not talking about work. 
 Fair enough. 
 Eddie Jones is kicking up a fuss. Thought you'd want to know. 
 For the record, I would have won. 
 You look well. 
 So do you. 
 Damn you. 
 I can't breathe. I can't breathe! 
 You bastards can't leave me here! 
 Kettle's on, Jim. 
 Cheers, boss. 
 It ain't right! 
 Can't leave me here! 
 What did you say? 
 What did they say? 
 She's lying! 
 She's a liar! 
 Here he is. 
 Mewling like a baby, that's what I heard. 
 "Don't let me die. Don't let me die!" 
 You haven't got it in you. 
 Is it important? 
 I don't know. 
 I've just Vimmed the sink. 
 I didn't know which were your favourites... so I got all of them. 
 I can see that. 
 There's a tea dance, over at the village hall. 
 I'm Vimming the sink. 
 No, no, not now. 
 Tonight. If you were at all interested? 
 I don't think so. 
 Maybe another time, then. 
 I'm not one for dancing. 
 It's wonderful to see you looking so well, Sylvia. 
 Goodbye, Jack. 
 I don't dance. Not since my -- 
 "My Ronnie left." 
 Why on earth not? 
 I mean, it's not as if your Ronnie's coming back, is it? 
 That sink won't clean itself. 
 Oh, dear. 
 Excellent! I look forward to days of palpable tension. 
 Geordie didn't come home last night. 
 I didn't do it, Sidney. 
 Why? 
 It's procedure. 
 No, why? 
 You know how these things work. 
 I am not taking leave. 
 You were the last man in that cell. 
 So what happened to 'innocent till proven guilty', eh? 
 What happened to that? 
 It's not like we're arresting you. 
 Not yet. 
 Don't make this personal. 
 It is bloody personal. 
 See Keating leaves the building. 
 I know where the sodding door is. 
 "Procedure." 
 I tell you what he can do with his bloody procedure. 
 Stick it up his arse, that's what he can do. 
 Two more over here. 
 We're finished. 
 Two more. 
 We're finished, Geordie. 
 Visiting hours, is it? 
 Time to minister to your waif and stray. 
 Why didn't you go home last night? 
 I was walking. I was... I was thinking. 
 And this? 
 He pissed me off, I punched the wall. 
 I do everything by the book. 
 I know you do -- 
 Straight down the line, Sidney. Straight as an arrow. 
 How does a man die alone in a locked cell? 
 You believe me, don't you? 
 Of course I do. 
 Is he drunk? 
 Don't start, Cathy. 
 Will you look into it for me? 
 Get some sleep. 
 Nine years I've been in this job. 
 Sometimes I'd wonder what I'd do without you. 
 If you need anything, you know where I am. 
 Geordie's been with another woman. 
 He wouldn't do that to you. 
 That's what I always thought. 
 Are you sure? 
 It was the day Gary Bell got sentenced. 
 He said he was with you, but Mrs Maguire said you was at home, so... 
 Have you asked him? 
 Didn't need to. 
 It's written all over his face. 
 He loves you, Cathy. He adores you. 
 Don't worry, I'm not gonna do anything stupid. 
 You don't knock down a wall just cos there's a crack in the plaster, do you? 
 He's not been himself, has he? Not for a long time. 
 He's not my Geordie any more. 
 Are you coming, Margaret? 
 Just a sec. 
 I know about you and Geordie. 
 In the pub, he was afraid you were going to tell me. 
 I'm not sure it's your business, Sidney. 
 I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. 
 We kissed. That's all it was. 
 Don't make it something it wasn't. 
 What was he thinking? 
 He was angry with you. So was I. 
 I really do think there was something between us. 
 Don't. 
 I wanted it to work. 
 How could it happen if Eddie was in that cell alone? 
 We've been told not to talk about it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Dicky Evans. Chap who's in the cell next to Eddie. 
 He drinks in the Six Bells. Keep an eye on your wallet. 
 He was going hell for leather, banging on the door. 
 "I can't breathe! I can't breathe!" 
 I see your fella go up there. 
 Next 'ting... shouting stopped. 
 You didn't hear Eddie again? 
 Uh-uh. Not a peep. 
 Was it true? 
 Your boy was screwing his missus? 
 Sorry. "Fornicating." 
 Hey, hey! Easy now. 
 That's what Eddie taught. 
 You ever considered a change of career? 
 What, go straight? Where's the fun in that? 
 Your boy got shot, innit? 
 Eddie said the bloke should have finished the job. 
 You wrestling with it, aren't you? 
 With what? 
 No way he died unless your pal did it. 
 No way on God's green earth. 
 I will not be in a room with that boy until he apologises properly. 
 It doesn't seem fair, really. She's always saying things that upset me. 
 Of course she does. It's the basis of her entire personality. 
 What have you lost? 
 Cigarette box. 
 I threw it away. It was full of tat. 
 It had a great deal of sentimental value. 
 "It is as healthy to enjoy sentiment as it is to enjoy jam." 
 I don't know how many other ways there are to apologise unless you want me to say it in, I don't know, Hebrew! 
 Words, words, words. Day in, day out. 
 I can't help it if I'm learned. 
 You're not learned. You've not lived. 
 And you have? Have you walked the Great Wall of China? 
 Have you ever fallen passionately in love? 
 You wouldn't know love if it punched you in the nose! 
 Fine! 
 All I meant about Ronnie was... 
 You know deep down he's not about to turn up any time soon, so... 
 Exceptional, Leonard! 
 Oh, dear. 
 
 
 
 Find anything? 
 I don't know. Possibly. 
 Go and see if your mam's got the tea on. 
 No! 
 It's the stolen goods from Eddie's place. 
 And this is a few months back. 
 You recovered some jewellery from the pawnbroker's on Mill Road. 
 Mm-hm. 
 And? 
 "Cameo brooch, amber necklace, opal ring." 
 The same items you found in Eddie's home. 
 Not necessarily. There's a butterfly pin here. 
 No butterfly pin at Eddie's place. 
 Come on, Geordie. 
 What? 
 What are you saying? 
 You think I took stolen goods from a station and set Eddie up. 
 Is that what you think? 
 I think you wanted to punish him. 
 I don't set people up. 
 You don't cheat on your wife, either. 
 You keep your voice down. 
 Cathy told me. 
 That has nothing to do with Eddie. 
 It says a lot about your state of mind, don't you think? 
 I didn't set him up. 
 It's like you're not you any more. 
 What does that mean? Hm? I didn't kill Eddie. 
 You don't believe me. 
 All that trouble you had with that Redmond girl, I stood by you. 
 I never doubted you for one second, Sidney. 
 Did you do it? 
 You should go. 
 Stolen goods are kept in the property store until the owners are found. 
 Geordie could have accessed them? 
 Geordie's one of the best. He says go, we all go. 
 We don't question it. 
 But he could have had access? 
 I suppose so. Not that it matters, really. 
 There's talk of arresting him. 
 Eye witness saw more than enough to convict him. 
 Who? 
 No chance, matey. 
 Do you think he did it? 
 I thought of everyone, you'd have his back. 
 Me dad's dead. 
 I know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Are you a policeman? 
 No. I'm a vicar. 
 See? 
 Here. 
 Why do you vicars need collars? 
 Er... For reasons far too boring to go into. 
 Did you see the police come and take your dad away? 
 They were cross with him. 
 Eddie was always making people cross. 
 You seen everything you need to see? 
 Yes, thank you. 
 How do I look? 
 Perfect. 
 Liar. 
 Bakery's got a few jobs going. 
 It's skivvy work, but it's that or the kids starve, so... 
 There. Would you take me on? 
 Er, without a doubt. 
 Put a word in with the fella upstairs, would you? 
 Don't you ever go away? 
 I want photographs of the cell and the body. 
 And I want a hundred quid. Life's one big disappointment. 
 I want the case file. 
 Don't you have some souls to save? 
 It's a nice brooch Rita's got. 
 Did you get it from the stolen property, too? 
 How long's it been going on, you and her? 
 You been following me? 
 Did you set Eddie up? 
 You been following me? 
 Were you getting him out of the way? 
 Keep your voice down. 
 Did you kill him, Phil? 
 He died in that cell while I was with my missus and her whole miserable family at the Rotary Club. 
 Can you prove that? 
 Geordie wanted to make something stick. 
 He wanted that b*st*rd behind bars. 
 So I obliged. 
 Geordie asked you to do it? 
 Not in so many words. 
 So you took it upon yourself. 
 What about Rita? 
 She's a sweet girl. She deserves a whole lot better. 
 I want the case file. 
 Piss off. 
 It's that or I have a word with your wife. 
 Phil set Eddie up. 
 You've seen me do wrong things for the right reasons. 
 You gonna let him get away with it? 
 He's a copper. 
 You see that? 
 One, two, three, four. 
 Identical. 
 That is not from a punch. 
 Someone pushed him into it? 
 Or he fell. 
 Repeatedly? 
 Phil says there was an eye witness. 
 There was no eye witness. 
 Someone came forward. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 We really don't need to go over this, do we? 
 Can't we just file it under 'embarrassing moments we'd rather forget'? 
 I'm sorry. I only told them what I saw. 
 You didn't see anything. 
 I saw you go in there. I saw you leave. 
 "I heard the sound of an argument -- " - I did. 
 I heard an argument. I heard shouting. 
 "And then the sound of a fight. 
 I didn't hear Mr Jones shout after that." 
 I'm so sorry, what was I supposed to do? 
 I had to tell them the truth, didn't I? 
 I don't want to believe it, but... you were the only one in that cell, Geordie. 
 What other explanation can there be? 
 Anything else is just... impossible, isn't it? 
 I can't breathe! I can't breathe! 
 It is impossible. 
 The whole thing is impossible. 
 There was something in his drink. 
 Geordie. 
 He was dying already. 
 He must have had a seizure. 
 After all the noise he made, no-one took any notice. 
 Can I try your collar again? 
 Course you can. 
 Was your dad poorly, Charlie? 
 Is that why he was lying down? 
 He had a tummy ache, so Mum took him another drink. 
 When was that? 
 After he hit her. 
 Ta-da! 
 How's that for a feast? 
 You staying? Might as well, you're here more often than you're not. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Scaredy-cat. You get used to it. 
 Takes a while, but... it gets them in the end, don't it, Mum? 
 It's her, Geordie. 
 There you are, darling. Some chips. I know you like your chips. 
 Have you two made up yet? 
 Sidney -- 
 I'm not sure I can stand another night of abject misery. 
 You haven't heard? 
 It's Gary. 
 When? 
 8:00. Tomorrow morning. 
 Oh, God. 
 You wore your best hat. 
 You look beautiful. 
 No, no. Don't cry. 
 Please don't cry. I'm not scared. 
 It'll all be over in a jiffy, won't it? 
 And I'll be up there, with Nan and Gramps. 
 Having a rare old time. 
 My boy... 
 That's it now, I'm afraid. 
 No, please... 
 I love you. 
 I love you. 
 Cheerio, Mum. 
 Takes 48 hours from administration to death. 
 They'd yet to take you to the hospital. 
 What was it, Ri? 
 Do me a favour, will you? 
 Ring my sister. 
 One beating too many, was it? 
 She lives out near Southend with her husband. 
 Spot by the sea. He's a lovely chap. 
 They dote on my lot. They'd have them in a jiffy. 
 Was he starting on the kids? 
 Least now they stand a chance, don't they? 
 Least now there's some hope. 
 I could have stopped him, Ri. 
 No. 
 If you'd just told me. 
 Haven't you got lovely hands? 
 I read books and I say big words because... well, that's all I have. 
 I'm not wise and handsome like Sidney and I'm not strong and forthright like you. 
 All I have is my words. 
 But I do know what it is to love. 
 Do you know what it is to be lonely? 
 Yes. 
 But you don't have to be. 
 Don't you long for someone to share your secrets with and hold hands? Go on trips to the seaside? 
 Someone who's more than just a friend? 
 I used to love to dance. 
 I wasn't half bad at it, either. Foxtrot and the Waltz. 
 Jack sits by the river most mornings. 
 Be bold. 
 I know you have it in you. 
 I'm not going to Heaven, am I? 
 God won't love me in. 
 God loves you. 
 The b*st*rd won't let me in. 
 He understands. He does. 
 All I did is what Abi asked. That's all I did. 
 God loves you, Gary. I promise. 
 No-one else helped her. No-one else gave a damn! 
 This is not fair. 
 I know it isn't. 
 It's going to hurt, isn't it? 
 It'll be quick. 
 It will. It will be so quick. 
 I want Mum. 
 Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. 
 Thy kingdom come. 
 Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. 
 Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. 
 And lead us not into temptation... but deliver us from evil. 
 For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. 
 Forever... 
 The Lord bless you and keep you. 
 The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord bless you and keep you. 
 The Lord bless you and keep -- 
 Sidney. 
 How is it justice? 
 I don't know. 
 A girl dies so a boy must die. 
 How does that make any sense? 
 Listen, you'll be fine. You will. Because you have faith. 
 And your friends. 
 You're the bravest, kindest, wisest man I know. 
 Why do you always have to do that? 
 Why do you always have to give me hope? 
 Sidney -- 
 Go home. 
 I'm sorry, I -- 
 Why are you here? 
 Why do you keep coming back? What's the point? 
 Backgammon? 
 I'm going to beat you. 
 I doubt it. 
 At the prison were you? 
 Still... 
 Still what? 
 Justice had to be done, didn't it? 
 You consider it justice? 
 You need a pint and quick. 
 It's revenge. It's retribution. 
 It's not me that makes the law. 
 But it's what you believe. 
 I suppose it is what I believe. 
 Hanging Gary was the right thing to do. 
 What? 
 I don't understand you. 
 What? 
 Where's your compassion? 
 I have compassion. 
 I had compassion! 
 Why do you always side with the bad ones, eh? 
 Why do you always do that, Sidney? 
 Is it because you see yourself in them? 
 Is that it? 
 Yeah, is it because you've killed, too? 
 That soldier you put out of his misery. What was his name? 
 Sidney! 
 He's lost. And we're all lost without him. 
 How do I find the strength? 
 I don't know. 
 Perhaps it's time to cut out the dead wood. 
 Don't tell me you haven't looked at this place and imagined yourself at the helm. 
 There has to be a line in the sand. 
 We can't keep playing this game, Sidney and I.
