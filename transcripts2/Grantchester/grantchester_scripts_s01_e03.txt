 Don't feel obliged to say yes. 
 Say anything you want to us. Honestly, we can take it. 
 Amanda didn't want to ask. 
 Because I know how busy you are. 
 It's worth a shot, don't you think? 
 Just ask. 
 How would you feel about marrying us in Grantchester? 
 It would be my honour. 
 See? 
 You've no idea how much this means to us. 
 As you don't live in my parish, I will have to make an application to the Archbishop. 
 Whatever it takes. 
 And as your priest, I have to ask - 
 He's gone all serious. 
 You're entering into this with your eyes open? 
 Marriage is not something to be taken lightly. 
 Well, no, we're not taking it lightly, are we? 
 No. 
 It's such a relief. You've got no idea. 
 (music) 
 (door shuts) 
 Mrs Maguire : Morning! 
 Erm...just a minute! 
 Hand-holders in the sitting room. Thomas Owen's widow in the kitchen. 
 The tap in the churchyard has given up the ghost, causing no end of grievance for Miss Sheppard. 
 You've forgotten, haven't you? 
 Forgotten? 
 This cannot go on, Mr Chambers. 
 Sorry! 
 Leonard! 
 I can't tell you how long I've waited for this. 
 I look forward to brisk walks, quiet reflection. 
 And evenings by the fireside with your good self. 
 Fiercely discussing the status of the priesthood. 
 Welcome home, Leonard. 
 You're to keep your room tidy and clean up after yourself. 
 Hand-holders, Mr Chambers. Cupboards are for clothes. 
 Shelves for books. Washing and ironing will be extra, especially if you want your dog collars starched. 
 Meals are provided, it's a lot easier now that I've come to the end of ration book. 
 It won't include much fish. Don't go getting yourself involved. 
 Involved? 
 Crime, women, drinking. We've had enough of it. 
 The church and the parish will be his only concern, Mrs M. 
 I'm sure everything will work out beautifully. 
 Have you been a curate before? 
 No. 
 Then everything will be a surprise to you. 
 She isn't one to mince her words. 
 I can tell. 
 Erm... that man in there, Arthur Evans, he's a rotten apple. 
 Mr Finch... 
 Mr Finch! 
 We very much hope to be married. 
 We've resolved to be married. 
 Resolved. 
 That's right, Arthur, we're resolved. 
 I understand we've only known each other a few months - 
 Seven months. 
 Talk over each other : Seven months since... 
 Since he started work at the chemist. 
 When you know, you know, don't you? 
 It would be my honour. 
 You're both entering into this with your eyes open? 
 Marriage is not a decision to be taken lightly. 
 We don't take it lightly, do we, Is? 
 I'm sorry. 
 If you have any... misgivings... 
 It's not her with the misgivings. 
 She came to you. 
 Soft girl. 
 She wanted guidance. 
 The church. 
 Always meddling in people's affairs. 
 It's my job to help. 
 It's your job to meddle. 
 Why do you believe in it all? Clever man like you. 
 My sister is the same. 
 I never understood it. 
 This blind acceptance. 
 It's called faith. 
 To the point, Mr Chambers. 
 I'm sure you must have a point. 
 Your daughter is in love. 
 What does a bachelor know of love? 
 I know enough. 
 Toiling away in that place. 
 No wife, no children. 
 What a waste. 
 They're not getting married. 
 What are you so opposed to? 
 Arthur Evans. 
 He's trying to do me in. 
 It's a little on the hot side. 
 Oh! 
 This is what she's like. 
 I love him. 
 You don't know him. 
 Oh, well. I'm not sure even Jesus himself would have a way with your mother. 
 I'll visit again tomorrow. 
 Mr Chambers! 
 Miss Sheppard. 
 Have you heard? 
 The tap? 
 Begonias are in an awful fix. 
 I do like my displays to be perfect. 
 Were you visiting my sister? 
 Attempting to, yes. 
 Oh, dear. 
 Remember, the tap. 
 The tap, absolutely. 
 Feet! 
 I know, I know. 
 Is there anything I can be doing? 
 Anything that might require my attention elsewhere perhaps? 
 I'll be with you in just a minute. 
 What did he want, the rotten apple? 
 I would say that's almost certainly none of your business. 
 I know a bit about rotten apples. I was married to one for 20 years. 
 It's your standards, they're slipping. 
 Leonard, erm... how about you start on your sermon? 
 You're preaching on Sunday. 
 Sunday? 
 As in... Sunday? 
 Just speak from the heart, you can't go far wrong. 
 Oh, for God's sake, man, it's one pint. 
 I'm not drinking. 
 You spoilsport. 
 What's this? 
 It's from Hildegard Staunton. 
 A German. 
 Geordie. 
 Reads : 'Dear Sidney, I hope this letter finds you well.' 
 That's debatable. 'It's been some time since I saw you last in those sad, long days after my husband's funeral. 
 I miss Cambridge and find my thoughts stray to you often.' 
 You sly old dog. 
 Will you write back? 
 It's too soon. 
 And in some ways too late. 
 Ah, bollocks. 
 Be straight with me, please (!) 
 Sometimes in life you just have to get on with things. 
 It's a wife you need, not a dog. 
 A dog is all I was offered. 
 That new fella of yours, the pansy, he's just made an entrance. 
 You are needed, as a matter of urgency. 
 Wake up, Mum. 
 Isabel. 
 Wake up! 
 Stop it. 
 'Wake up, Mum.' 
 'Wake up! Wake up!' 
 Get down, Sandy! 
 (gun shots) 
 Get down! 
 Rotten to the core. 
 I'm not getting involved. 
 Tea, Mr Finch? 
 I say let the world go to hell but I shall always have my tea. 
 Yes, please. 
 Sidney, it's very much a first draft. 
 I'll be brutally honest. Well, perhaps not brutally. 
 With regard to Mr Evans - 
 The church and the parish will be my only concern, Mrs Maguire. 
 I hear you've got yourself a rotten apple. 
 He had something to do with it. 
 I know he did. You just have to look at him. 
 I'm sorry, we've wasted your time. 
 No, you haven't. 
 Arthur Evans... 
 There's no record of him. Using an alias, most likely. 
 And no-one uses an alias unless - 
 They're a rotten apple. 
 What do you think to him? 
 I'm supposed to give people the benefit of the doubt. 
 You don't trust him any more than I do. 
 Mrs Livingstone thought that Arthur was trying to do her in. 
 Her words, not mine. 
 She never said that. How awful. 
 You have to give people the benefit of the doubt. I don't. 
 I have my parishioners to think about. 
 Daisy Livingstone was your parishioner too. 
 It's a delicate matter, Dr Robinson. 
 There's no such thing as a delicate matter as far as I'm concerned. 
 Mrs Livingstone. 
 Ah, the delightful Mrs Livingstone. 
 What was the cause of death? 
 Complications resulting from breast cancer. 
 So you believe she had a pressing appointment with her maker? 
 I think she lived longer than she should have out of sheer spite. 
 Is there a chance Mrs Livingstone was, erm... helped on her way? 
 As far as I'm concerned she died of natural causes. 
 So you found no reason to think otherwise? 
 Erm... Mr Fielding is not doing so well. 
 Ah, thank you, Betty. 
 Sidney, my job is to state the cause of death to the best of my knowledge. 
 How are we today, Mr Fielding? 
 Not too bright, doctor. 
 Give me a minute, I'll be right with you. 
 So, you signed off on the death certificate? 
 I saw no reason not to. 
 I had dealings with this coroner before. 
 He's retiring, thank God. Utterly useless. 
 Intent. That's all the self-important b*st*rd ever has to say. 
 No, the question as I see it, Inspector, should always be of intent. 
 Good afternoon, Mr Jarvis. 
 Good afternoon. 
 And in this case there appears to be none? 
 None whatsoever. 
 Good afternoon, Mr Jarvis. 
 Good afternoon. 
 I don't want to appear impolite, Mr Chambers, but I'm not quite sure how this matter involves you. 
 Are you questioning my intent, Mr Jarvis? 
 It's just that we don't often see the likes of you in these less than congenial surroundings. 
 You didn't perform a post-mortem? 
 She's been dying for years. 
 And the body has been released? 
 Well, I sincerely hope so, the cremation is this afternoon. 
 Bloody hell. 
 Well, that's that, then. 
 Bloody, bloody hell. 
 If you're to marry them, you have to put them through their paces, give them advice. 
 Of course. 
 Well, perhaps while you're at it, you could ask Mr Evans a few pertinent questions. 
 Mother put herself down for a cremation with the Co-op. 
 No point dragging it out, we've got a wedding to think of. 
 Who was with her when she died? 
 No-one, I was out. 
 I know that when those close to you die, it, it can often be a relief. 
 I thought it would be. 
 She wasn't a kind woman at the end of her days. 
 She wasn't a kind woman full stop. 
 Still. 
 I will not make the woman out to be a saint. 
 We all know the truth of it. 
 We found Mum's will. 
 Left everything to her sister. 
 She despised Aunt Gladys. 
 Despised us even more. 
 (church bells) 
 Excuse me? Daisy Livingstone? 
 I've come to pay my respects. 
 She isn't here, she was cremated. 
 Did you know her well? 
 Many moons ago. 
 I know she wasn't a great believer but she always wanted to end her days here. 
 Under the oak she said so she could keep her eye on everyone. 
 Always liked to keep her eye on everyone. 
 Well, thank you anyway. 
 Cornflowers. 
 My sister loved them. 
 It seems a shame that she wasn't buried under the oak like she wanted. 
 Oh, dear. 
 It is a shame, isn't it? 
 Sidney. 
 I don't suppose you had any notes? My sermon. 
 Oh, erm... no. None. 
 None? Whatsoever? 
 Erm... it was very... erm... erm... pithy. 
 Excellent. You have allayed my fears. 
 Reporting for duty, sir. 
 Amanda. 
 Guy is caught up in London. 
 I promised to tell him everything verbatim. I'm even taking notes. 
 Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Oh, dear, what? 
 There are tensions between Kantian and Utilitarian ethics, which brings me back to my original point about Kant. 
 Which brings me back in turn... to Luke... 
 6:31. 
 'And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.' 
 Which brings me back again in turn to one of the most fascinating and major alternatives to the categorical imperative - 
 Jeremy Bentham's means-end theory of morality - 
 Utilitarianism. 
 You said it was pithy. 
 In truth I didn't have time to read it. 
 I thought we were supposed to set an example. 
 Lying is, after all, immoral. 
 Is it immoral if we do it to preserve someone's feelings? 
 You were doing it to save face. 
 Yes, thank you, Mrs Maguire. 
 In future I'll read your sermon ten times. 
 A dozen times. Perhaps a little less philosophy might help. 
 Wisdom isn't always to be found in books. 
 I like books. They're so much less terrifying than people. 
 Knock on a few doors. 
 Take Dickens with you, he always gets people talking. 
 If one does something wrong for the greater good, isn't it a slippery slope? Where does one stop? 
 It's a grey area, Leonard. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I'm thinking... what is Jeremy Bentham's means-end theory? 
 Are you sure you're happy to take the wedding? 
 I didn't quite know how to tell you... the Archbishop has turned down your application. 
 Outsiders getting married in the church, it's against protocol apparently and he's a stickler for protocol. 
 Well, if he's a stickler... It was a silly idea anyway. 
 Tell me more about your dead old lady. 
 I think the daughter or her beau helped her on her way. 
 Why would they do that? 
 So they could get married. 
 Couldn't they wait? 
 Apparently not. 
 Well, then there is one possibility that springs to mind. 
 Marrying in a hurry, as quickly as they can... 
 Oh, for someone so intelligent, you're being terribly dim, Sidney. 
 If your mother wanted to be buried... why go against her wishes? 
 Because she never let me when she was alive. 
 That's all there is to it. 
 You don't believe me. 
 I believe you're not being entirely honest. 
 Forgive me, Isabel, but are you pregnant? 
 Arthur said he was over the moon. 
 That's where I keep the housekeeping. 
 There was over £3.00. 
 My jewellery is gone too. 
 Where is he? 
 Last night we had a restaurant booked. 
 I waited ever such a long time. 
 Dickens? Dickens! 
 Come here. 
 
 
 
 Sidney! Sidney! 
 Miss Sheppard? 
 The door was open so I just... 
 I didn't think. 
 Everyone has been so kind. 
 People have welcomed me, a perfect stranger, into their homes without a second thought. 
 So I just went in. 
 I've never seen a person dead before. 
 No bruising. 
 No sign of a struggle. 
 If this was murder, she knew her attacker. 
 Well, it's possible. 
 Death would have been instantaneous. Heart failure, I'd say. 
 Caused by what? 
 Well, poison, maybe. 
 What we have to consider here is the matter of intent. 
 Thank you, Mr Jarvis. 
 Doctors and vicars, the only professions where you're at everyone's beck and call, even when you're attempting to have a night off. 
 You wouldn't have it any other way. 
 Neither would you. She's calmer now. 
 Isabel? 
 Miss Livingstone. 
 Erm... we found this in your aunt's house. 
 Nothing else appears to have been taken, just the photograph. 
 Isabel. The photo. 
 Do you remember what it was? 
 Me when I was a baby. 
 Me and my mum. 
 "He'll break your heart." That's what she said. 
 "Men are bastards. 
 It's what they do." 
 I should have listened. 
 Now she wants to throw her boyfriend to the wolves. 
 Changed her tune pretty quick. 
 Her mother's will. The house, the money. It all went to the aunt. 
 And now she's dead, what's the betting our Isabel inherits the lot? 
 Erm... Arthur Evans. Erm... Smith. Or, erm... Grant - 
 Whoa, just take your time, Atkins. 
 We found his car. 
 I think he's left Isabel to face the music. 
 I want him found. 
 So you think they're in on it together, Arthur and Isabel? 
 What happened to giving people the benefit of the doubt? 
 Sir! 
 Gotcha. 
 Argh. 
 Stay down. 
 Jesus. All this for a bit of cheap jewellery. 
 I marry for the money. 
 I take what I can and move on. I don't hurt people. 
 I don't kill. 
 So... 
 How did you do it? 
 Bit of poison in the cocoa? 
 No. 
 Poison you stole from your work at the chemist and it's nighty-night. 
 I wouldn't do that. 
 Maybe Miss Livingstone did it, then. You in on this together? 
 That girl is a good girl, don't you dare bring her into this. 
 You're fond of Isabel. 
 Anyone can see that. 
 I feel sorry for her. 
 You know she's having your child? 
 Maybe it will be the making of her. 
 Maybe now that bitch of a mum has gone she can be happy. 
 There's this bloke. Old fella. Been hanging around for a couple of days. 
 Honest to God, maybe it's him. 
 Maybe it's him you should be looking for. 
 There was an old man. He came to the church after Mrs Livingstone died. 
 I saw him last night too. 
 Well, that's not proof, Sidney. 
 Fingerprints on the frame, sir. They don't match Arthur Evans. 
 Father of all, we pray to thee... for those whom we love... but see no longer. 
 Grant them thy peace. 
 Let light perpetual shine upon them. 
 Didn't fancy the wake? 
 Too many people to avoid. 
 I, erm... used to be a choir boy here. 
 Sang the solo at midnight mass every year until my voice went. 
 Place doesn't change, does it? 
 The world keeps turning but Grantchester stays the same. 
 Why I had to get away. 
 How did you know the sisters? 
 I went to school with them. 
 Snow White and Rose Red, that's what we used to call them. 
 One as soft as snow, the other prickly as a rose. 
 You couldn't just, erm... 
 Thank you. 
 When I won't come to church, you bring the church to me, is that it? 
 Well, these are the prints from the photo frame. 
 And these from your silver cup. 
 Chalice. 
 Looked like a silver cup to me. 
 They match. 
 The old fella was with Miss Sheppard the day she died. 
 It's enough to bring him in. 
 Right, where we headed? 
 What's the address? 
 But you got his name? 
 Erm... erm... he used to be a choir boy, if that's any use? 
 It's no use at all. 
 No. 
 Feet! 
 I know! I've neglected my duties, my standards are slipping. 
 Can I just have a cup of tea and drink it in peace? 
 Jack. 
 This is Mr Chambers. He's usually quite pleasant. 
 Daisy was a wild girl. 
 My goodness, you made a handsome couple. 
 This was before she was married, of course? Before Isabel? 
 Why did you come back, Mr Chapman? 
 This is from Miss Sheppard's. 
 She gave it to me. 
 There was no Mr Livingstone, was there? 
 Isabel is yours. 
 Daisy was shipped off. 
 Came back a year later, ring on her finger, little one in her arms. 
 I wasn't looking for a family, not then. 
 You were just a boy, Jack. 
 So... 
 Isbael has no idea you exist. 
 I wanted to... to see the world. 
 I'm afraid I didn't look back. 
 Until now. 
 Gladys wrote. 
 Said her sister was dying, that she was sick too. 
 But there was time to make things right. 
 Miss Sheppard was sick? 
 Cancer. 
 In the breast. Same as her sister. 
 Do you we know for sure? 
 His penchant for the opposite of the opposite s*x? 
 What business is it of yours or mine or any-bloody-one when it comes to that? Thank you. 
 How long is this self-restraint going to last? 
 Because frankly, you're no fun anymore. 
 What's this? 
 Be a busman's holiday for you. 
 It poses the question, can something which is not virtuous ever truly be justified? 
 Can it? 
 No, not really. 
 What happened to Jack Chapman? 
 Well, I let him go. 
 Having a cuppa with an old dear is not an arrestable offence. 
 My money is still on the girl and her fella. Post-mortem came back. 
 Potassium chloride. 
 So, how are you finding things? You made any... friends? 
 Not friends exactly. 
 Everyone has been very kind. Very welcoming. 
 Maybe that's where the old bill are going wrong - dog collars, that's what we need. 
 He does this from time to time. Excuse us. 
 There was no sign of a struggle. 
 Tell me something I don't know. 
 Arthur Evans. Mrs Livingstone did not trust him and yet there was no sign of a struggle. 
 There was no sign of a struggle at his sister's either. 
 Exactly. They let them in. They trusted the killer with their lives. 
 (knock on door) 
 It's open. 
 Mr Jarvis. 
 We're closed. 
 Unless you wanna be arrested, you're very much open, mate. 
 Here. 
 And again. 
 And again. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 You signed all of these off? 
 Yes. 
 So many and you never thought to question the causes of death? 
 He's a good man, a fine man, his intent - 
 Oh, shut up. Bloody fool. 
 Will it hurt? 
 Not a bit. 
 Dr Robinson. No! 
 Let him do it. 
 I can't live like this. 
 Please. 
 Let him do it. 
 How many people have you killed? 
 Society has to trust that a doctor knows what is best for its patients. 
 You have to trust that. 
 How many? 
 I have relatively uninformed opinions about the police force, about theology. 
 I leave that to you. 
 I don't know about your worlds. 
 I don't expect you to know about mine. 
 But when people die, our worlds collide. 
 And when they're killed - 
 Sidney, you've sat with the dying. 
 Many times. 
 And you, Inspector. 
 Sometimes people are ready. 
 Sometimes they hold on and suffer terribly. 
 I have seen how debilitating an illness can be. 
 Then you understand. 
 No, I don't. 
 You're a compassionate man. How could you not? 
 You've seen Mr Fielding. He is suffering, he wants to die. 
 I'm sure there were many who cried out for you to do something. 
 You must have felt that you were relieving their pain, that they were at peace. 
 They were with God. But that can never justify - 
 God. 
 I have never seen God at the bedside of someone in agonising pain. 
 It's an extraordinary thing. 
 In those final moments, I don't think faith makes a blind bit of difference. 
 I do what is right. 
 So was it right when you killed Mrs Livingstone? 
 Was it right when you killed Miss Sheppard? 
 They were old. 
 They were dying. 
 They were living too. 
 You've killed. 
 You were both soldiers. 
 You both fought. 
 It was your duty to take lives. 
 And it is your duty to save them. 
 My conscience is clear, Mr Chambers. 
 I doubt even you could say that. 
 He's a crackpot. 
 Seems sane enough to me. 
 The most insane often do. 
 Do you believe - 
 What? 
 There's ever justification for killing? 
 Do you think I'd be in this job if I thought that? 
 What about war? 
 War is different, you know it's different. 
 Did you kill, Geordie? 
 What do you think? 
 One for the road? 
 It's good to have you back. 
 It's threadbare but it's clean. 
 Cheer up that gloomy room of yours no end. 
 I don't know what to say. It's the nicest thing anyone ever gave me. 
 Polite and he hoovers, if only all men were like him. 
 If they were, there wouldn't be much chance for the human race. 
 What do you mean by that? 
 Oh, erm... nothing. 
 Hand-holders, sitting room. 
 This is all rather mysterious, why the summons? 
 Well, there was a bit of confusion. 
 The Archbishop granted your request. 
 You could have lied. We wouldn't have been any of the wiser. 
 I, erm... hear we're in for a treat - Leonard's second coming. 
 Kant once wrote - 
 "By a lie, a man annihilates his dignity as a man." 
 Our good friend Immanuel wasn't one to mince his words. 
 He saw things in black and white. 
 He didn't dwell on the grey areas. 
 But who amongst us can honestly say that we haven't lied for good reason? 
 Who amongst us can say we live a truly good life? 
 And that's not to say we shouldn't try. 
 We should all continually try to be the best we can be. 
 To escape the sins of our past... to be accepting of our little foibles... and of others. 
 We can't run away from who we are. 
 We must turn and face the truth head on. 
 Sometimes in life... it's better just to... get on with things. 
 'Dear Hildegard, it was a wonderful surprise to hear from you. 
 I can understand you missing Cambridge. 
 Perhaps one day you'll come out for a visit. 
 We could take a boat out on the Cam. 
 I'd like that very much.' 
 Shall I take him in, sir? 
 Go ahead. 
 Geordie, he didn't do anything. 
 It was no accident, Mr Chambers. 
 Please don't let my dad find out. 
 It will destroy him. 
 You hate your life. 
 You hate it so much, you have to screw up everyone else's. 
 You gave me your word. 
 I'm not the one in the wrong. 
 You're not thinking straight. 
 Don't you tell me what I'm thinking! 
 You're a stupid, stupid man! 
 Never behave like that in front of one of my guests again. 
 If you didn't have God on your side, I'd tell you where to get off Mr Chambers. 
 There was a better way to do this. 
 I'm scared, Sidney. 
 I know. 
 Mr Taylor, where's your wife?! 
 Fire Brigade, right away!
