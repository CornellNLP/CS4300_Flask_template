 PIANO MUSIC PLAYING Boss. 
  Have a look at the blonde. 
  She'll be picking sick out of that blonde hair come midnight. 
  Mark my words, Larry. 
  Same every year. 
  Spring bloody balls. 
  We all know how the creation story starts. 
  But even though we've been cast out of Eden, it doesn't mean we have to wait until heaven to glimpse paradise. 
  - Behave. 
  Behave. 
  - Whoa! 
  SIGHING What did I tell ya? 
  And just because we're fallen doesn't mean we have to keep falling. 
  The insider can report that Tobias Montague, second son of the Earl of Montague, was seen trading blows with High Court judge Hugh Teague's son and namesake. 
  "Too much punch?" We don't have to listen to the snakes. 
  We don't have to eat the apples. 
  Though I could probably make an exception for Mrs Chapman's apple pie. 
  LAUGHTER We can never return to Eden, but through our choices, our actions, with Jesus' help, I believe we can get close. 
  We are all Adam and Eve and the world is our garden. 
  - Amen. 
  - ALL: Amen. 
  - Thank you very much. 
  - Thank you. 
  Here we are, then. 
  - Good old Grantchester. 
  - Hmm. 
  Quiet compared to Marrakech, isn't it? 
  I think anywhere would be. 
  Until next year, then. 
  Well, I'll see you before then. 
  Inshallah. 
  I think we're allowed a stiff handshake. 
  Mmm. 
  Thanks, Marie. 
  I'm surprised you made it. 
  A hangover's never kept me from a good breakfast. 
  I'm not talking about the hangover. 
  I thought staying in a college bed might have stirred some of the old instincts. 
  Yeah. 
  Sleep. 
  How was your night? 
  Hmm? 
  Like being a PC again. 
  All hands on deck. 
  Six drunk disorderlies, two serious assaults. 
  But only four incidents of indecent exposure. 
  What is it with bloody students this time of year? 
  It's the end of term, Geordie. 
  Just letting their hair down. 
  And their trousers. 
  Who's letting their trousers down? 
  - Oh. 
  Morning, Ellie. 
  - Oh, come on. 
  I'll tell you which senior police officer was seen perusing the ladies of Mill Road last night. 
  William Davenport, Ellie Harding. 
  Ellie writes for The Echo. 
  Seems to think I'm a free source of news. 
  And cigarettes. 
  Hi. 
  Ah. 
  He's better-looking than the rest of your boys. 
  I wouldn't bother. 
  He's celibate. 
  - Thanks. 
  - Oh, you're that Will. 
  Should change your name to Won't. 
  - Boss. 
  We need you. 
  - Not you. 
  Oh. 
  So you take a vicar but not a journalist? 
  Judging by what she's wearing, she was a guest at the ball last night. 
  Porters found her first thing. 
  They say sometimes students jump off the bridge to show off. 
  If she were showing off, there'd be witnesses. 
  Excuse me? 
  Oi! 
  Police! 
  This is part of Linley College. 
  Probably don't wanna admit they spent the night with boys. 
  - Jess. 
  - Miss, Miss. 
  - Jess? 
  - Can't come down here. 
  That's my friend, she's my friend. 
  Jess. 
  WOMAN GASPING DOG BARKING Hello, Dickens. 
  Hello. 
  HE CHUCKLES Oh, I've missed you. 
  Oh. 
  There you are! 
  How was Bognor? 
  You've had the sun, then. 
  It was very temperate. 
  I've got you some dates and this is argan oil. 
  It's supposed to be very good for your skin. 
  From Bognor? 
  And some slippers for Will. 
  Bognor Regis? 
  Mm-hm. 
  Well HE SIGHS We were drinking and dancing and talking to boys together. 
  But then I went to the lavatory and when I came back, she'd gone. 
  I just assumed she'd gone back to Newnham. 
  When I got there around 11, she hadn't signed in. 
  When she wasn't there this morning Was there anyone else there she was talking to? 
  There were some other girls from our college. 
  And these boys you were dancing with? 
  SHE EXHALES It was a ball, there were hundreds of them. 
  You don't think one of them We're just trying to establish what happened. 
  You know, we won't know anything until after the post-mortem. 
  What was Jessica's mood like? 
  The last time you saw her. 
  Good. 
  I mean, she could get a little maudlin when drunk. 
  Maudlin about what? 
  It can be quite difficult to fit in here. 
  Especially at big functions, where everyone knows everyone else. 
  How do you act? 
  But not last night. 
  Last night she was happy. 
  It was fun, I think. 
  So, when you say you were drinking how drunk do you think Jessica was? 
  We're not used to drinking champagne and these boys are so generous, they do top you up. 
  All right. 
  Thank you, Miss, er? 
  Fitzpatrick. 
  Vronky. 
  It's short for Veronica. 
  If we have any more questions, we'll be in touch. 
  Bye. 
  HE SIGHS I don't suppose you fancy a post-mortem on a hangover. 
  - It's the third weekend of the month. 
  - Eh? 
  - Lunch with Mum. 
  - Oh. 
  Well, it's east-facing, so the sun does come in first thing and the curtains are rather thin. 
  We can always replace the curtains. 
  And the upstairs neighbours walk about like elephants. 
  A lady does like to live in the manner to which she's accustomed, doesn't one? 
  How was your holiday, Leonard? 
  Oh, it was paradise. 
  There. 
  What about a week away? 
  That might cheer you up. 
  Have you ever tried the English riviera? 
  - Bognor. 
  - I don't need cheering up. 
  - You were complaining again. 
  - I was making conversation. 
  Mum, you have money, a flat in Chelsea. 
  This is your chance to build the life you want. 
  I have the life I want. 
  I saw a dead girl today who will never have that opportunity. 
  Well, I can't compete with that. 
  I'm not asking you to compete. 
  I just want you to try. 
  More shepherd's pie, anyone? 
  No, thank you, Sylvia. 
  It was delicious, but I've had quite enough. 
  Mum, I'm Would you be so kind as to telephone for a taxi? 
  That's the contents of her handbag. 
  Get these tested, see where they're from. 
  Yes, boss. 
  She was wearing that under her dress. 
  A garter. 
  She didn't sound like the type. 
  Pathologist said cause of death was a blow to the side of her head. 
  She could've hit it on a rock at the bottom of the river. 
  He said there was no water in her lungs. 
  But that means she was dead before she went into the water. 
  GRUNTING Come on, knees up, no slacking. 
  All right, straight in. 
  20 press-ups. 
  Chest to the floor. 
  Come on, you too, Vicar. 
  Show 'em how it's done. 
  I'm busy losing to this bag. 
  You all right? 
  Ah, you know, the world. 
  Hey, it's a beautiful place. 
  Don't let anyone tell you different. 
  Here he is! 
  You got any fresh blood for me, Keatsy? 
  No, not this time, Vic. 
  Well, it's no wonder, is it? 
  In that shape you'll never catch 'em. 
  Hey, there's someone wants a word with ya. 
  Hey, Luke. 
  Hey. 
  I never said stop, did I? 
  Go on, carry on. 
  Right. 
  What do you wanna say to the inspector? 
  I'm sorry for stealing them bikes. 
  And thank you for sending me here instead of prison. 
  Wasn't my choice, son. 
  You can thank my chief constable for that. 
  But I'm glad to see you're enjoying it. 
  Wanna see him spar? 
  Never gives up, this one. 
  It's Will I need to see, actually. 
  What's he done this time? 
  I need his help with a murder investigation. 
  And how come he's always so bloody cheerful? 
  Vic's Victors. 
  Too many punches to the head, if you ask me. 
  Oh, come on. 
  It's gotta be better than Borstal. 
  Hard work, discipline, a chance to make something of themselves. 
  Yeah. 
  Tougher criminals. 
  FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING - Inspector. 
  - Principal Shaw. 
  Andrea, please. 
  Mr William Davenport. 
  He was there when we first discovered the body and he's assisting with our inquiry. 
  - I'm sorry about Jessica. 
  - Indeed. 
  However, with not one but two pillars of the patriarchy in attendance, state and church, I'm sure we'll soon get to the bottom of this. 
  This is why I need you here. 
  Feel free to translate. 
  You ever wonder what a girl feels like walking past a building site? 
  - Not really. 
  - Well, now you know. 
  Jessica Hall was a model student. 
  Were you aware of any disagreements or quarrels Jessica was having? 
  Perhaps with the other girls. 
  Oh, that's rather a tired old trope, don't you think, Inspector? 
  High-achieving women keeping each other in their place isn't something we encourage or tolerate at Newnham. 
  That's a no. 
  Was she the type to have boyfriends? 
  - Male acquaintances? 
  - The type? 
  Well, the inspector's just trying to build a picture of Jessica's life. 
  Well, we don't tend to have men on college grounds, so I wouldn't know. 
  Please excuse the disarray. 
  Jessica's death will cast a shadow over our college ball tomorrow, but we'll now hold it in her honour. 
  I would've thought a ball was a patriarchal tradition for your tastes. 
  Not the way we're doing it. 
  There'll be an all-female band, speakers and, of course, it'll be the girls asking the boys to dance, rather than the other way round. 
  Lock up your sons. 
  These are the girls who attended the Linley ball last night. 
  We saw you at the scene this morning. 
  We called to you, but you didn't stop. 
  Must've been some other girls. 
  Of course we would've stopped for poor Jessica. 
  We're investigating the murder of one of your friends. 
  - Murder? 
  - I would appreciate some cooperation. 
  Heather and her friends signed back in to the college before curfew. 
  See here? 
  I specifically requested this from the porter's lodge. 
  These are all in the same handwriting. 
  I signed in for all of us. 
  And are there any witnesses who can verify the times written here? 
  A night porter's on hand for any disturbances, but we trust our students, Inspector. 
  Newnham girls know how to behave. 
  Perhaps we could take a look at Jessica's room. 
  Alone. 
  The girls can't say they were out all night in front of the principal. 
  Hello? 
  See? 
  Proves my point. 
  They do it in case the night porter does the rounds. 
  So she was the type. 
  What does that even mean? 
  - I used to do it. 
  - Exactly. 
  WILL EXHALES - Geordie. 
  - Mm-hm. 
  Bennies. 
  Pep-up pills. 
  Yeah, I know what Benzedrine is. 
  How do you? 
  Well, people do them at rock 'n' roll nights. 
  I've heard. 
  So she was taking uppers. 
  Out all night. 
  And she's not the only one. 
  We could try and speak to the girls separately. 
  Try and piece together her movements from there. 
  Between drink, pills and covering for each other? 
  I doubt we're gonna get anything concrete. 
  Unless We got the film from the official photographer. 
  Survivors' photograph. 
  They take it at the end of the ball, to prove you made it through the night. 
  I didn't think you could be seen around here. 
  Shame about the circumstances. 
  GEORDIE CLEARS THROA It's not that dark in here. 
  Et voila. 
  There's Jessica. 
  And Vronky. 
  She said she was back at Newnham by 11. 
  Those boys look fairly familiar with them, too. 
  - Geordie. 
  - No comment yet, Ellie. 
  Is it true the girl's body was found decapitated? 
  - She wasn't decapitated. 
  - Ah, so a girl was found dead. 
  - Schoolboy error. 
  - Who was she, then? 
  Drunk posh girl who met the wrong bloke? 
  She was a young woman trying to enjoy herself and make something of her life. 
  - Well, aren't we all? 
  - WILL SCOFFS If spreading malicious gossip's how you enjoy yourself, you might wanna have another look at your life. 
  Well, at least I make my own stuff up for a living, rather than spouting rubbish from some old book. 
  Come on. 
  You've got work to do. 
  How can anyone be that callous? 
  Journos are always like that. 
  They see enough darkness, they get used to it. 
  So do you. 
  So do I. 
  At least we're trying to make the world better, not worse. 
  I'll cancel the double date with her and Cathy, then, shall I? 
  STRAINING NOISES MAN: Help! 
  - PANTING - What's going on? 
  STRAINING Oi! 
  I saw you at Newnham this morning. 
  Won't be hard to trace you. 
  We just wanna talk. 
  It's them boys you should be talking to. 
  We will. 
  OK? 
  Hmm? 
  - Just hold him there. 
  - Wait. 
  - WILL GRUNTS - Oi! 
  WILL GROANS - You all right? 
  - Yeah. 
  Well, I see the boxing training came in handy (!) We don't know him. 
  He burst in accusing us of killing that girl found in the river. 
  - And did ya? 
  - Of course not. 
  She and her friend came back here to listen to some music after the ball. 
  - Wagner. 
  - But nothing happened. 
  She left. 
  Probably to lead on some other poor sod. 
  WILL SCOFFS - Will. 
  - I'd say that's a motive. 
  Steady on. 
  When a chap's been led to believe he's on a promise, I think he is entitled to feel a bit disappointed when he's let down. 
  - Disappointed enough to kill? 
  - Don't be ridiculous. 
  We're very sorry to hear about this young lady. 
  But if these girls want to gang together and act like boys, they need to learn to behave like us. 
  - Here, here. 
  - Gang together? 
  The Berserkers? 
  College drinking society. 
  You're saying the girls had a club of their own? 
  The Newnham Valkyries, they call themselves. 
  Might as well have been the Newnham Virgins, as far as she was concerned. 
  Her name was Jessica. 
  Did anyone else see her leave? 
  What was it, Franky? 
  Fronky? 
  Now that's who Wagner had in mind when he composed The Ride Of The Valkyries. 
  BOTH CHUCKLE I just didn't want you to think I was easy. 
  We're not here to judge. 
  Everything else I told you was true, except I pulled the timings forward. 
  After Jess left me with the boys for maybe 20 minutes, half an hour, I went to look for her, but I couldn't find her, so I came back to the college, around 5:00am. 
  But the others stayed out. 
  So this is your handwriting. 
  That was the rule. 
  First one back signs everyone else in. 
  I think Heather was just covering for me when she said it was her. 
  - The rule? 
  - Of The Valkyries. 
  Recognise the college colours? 
  It's nothing bad, it's just a society. 
  You get invited to all the best parties, you meet the nicest men. 
  At least you're looking out for each other. 
  You knew about this? 
  Do you know how many female colleges there are in Cambridge, Inspector? 
  - Three. 
  - Out of 25. 
  Men have been forming clubs like this for centuries. 
  We've only been allowed degrees for a decade. 
  So, I think it's only right that these women, who are going to be at the top of their fields one day, forge the networks that will carry them into the working world of the future. 
  Don't you? 
  Not if it means they obstruct a murder inquiry, no. 
  There is nothing connecting The Valkyries to Jessica's death. 
  They've already lied about where they all were last night. 
  For fear of being labelled 'easy'. 
  Which is nothing to be ashamed of if it's your own choice, Veronika. 
  The Valkyries are a sisterhood. 
  No-one would hurt Jess. 
  Why didn't you sign her in with everyone else? 
  She wasn't a full member yet. 
  Neither am I. 
  And how do you become one? 
  They leave a red rose on your door. 
  You go out to the garden to be sworn in by candlelight. 
  Every society needs its initiations, Inspector. 
  Better than downing ten pints and urinating into letterboxes, wouldn't you say? 
  This is the catering company that provides our event staff. 
  I hope you can find your mystery attacker. 
  What is the world coming to, hmm? 
  Female drinking societies. 
  That's the last thing I need. 
  The boys are bad enough. 
  Don't tell me you were in one. 
  The Conquerors. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  And what did you conquer? 
  Ourselves, mostly. 
  Ten pints and urinating in letterboxes. 
  I know, I know, it's pathetic. 
  I just suppose you wanna feel part of something at that age. 
  What's wrong with National Service, Will? 
  It's those girls again. 
  INDISTINCT WHISPERING What's going on? 
  We're picking flowers to make corsages for the ball tomorrow. 
  What's that? 
  Buried treasure? 
  They all belong to our ex-boyfriends. 
  Just saying goodbye before the ball. 
  Out with the old, in with the new. 
  Are you not trying to destroy evidence? 
  Of what? 
  Young love? 
  Were these an ex-boyfriend's? 
  I thought they were headache pills, but they made me feel ill. 
  Where did you get them from? 
  From Jessica. 
  The one girl that can't defend herself. 
  You may think that she was sweet and innocent, but Jessica knew how to have a good time. 
  She wasn't as discerning as the rest of us. 
  Especially when it came to men. 
  Probably why she ended up the way she did. 
  What's that supposed to mean? 
  Well, if you go for a bit of rough you can't be surprised if you're treated roughly. 
  SOFT CHUCKLING So, why did you attack the boys at Linley? 
  They was all over Jess at the ball, I thought they must have been the ones that hurt her. 
  You weren't trying to push the blame onto them for something you'd done? 
  No. 
  I liked her. 
  How did you know Jessica? 
  Served her at a couple of events. 
  Dinners, balls. 
  What, you serve a girl at dinner and now you're looking to avenge her death? 
  One of the girls said you might have had something more with Jessica. 
  Those girls are a bunch of gossips. 
  Jess wasn't like that. 
  No, she was nice. 
  You know I could have you for assault? 
  Won't be the first time. 
  Listen, the boys aren't pressing charges. 
  They don't wanna admit they were beaten up by a waiter. 
  Neither do I. 
  You've got a decent right hook. 
  My dad boxed. 
  Does he train you? 
  He's dead. 
  Sorry. 
  Matthew are you sure there is nothing else you can tell us about Jessica? 
  So we can get justice for her, instead of misplaced revenge. 
  He's holding something back. 
  I know it. 
  Agreed. 
  I do think he genuinely cares for her. 
  More than her so-called friends do, anyway. 
  - What about the principal? 
  - Have you been listening? 
  Well, the dead girl's from Newnham, right? 
  - How do you know that? 
  - I've got my sources. 
  Bloody Larry. 
  So, before she was at Newnham, Andrea Shaw was a senior fellow at Edinburgh, but missed out on a promotion to a colleague more than five years her junior. 
  - A bloke, of course. 
  - So? 
  So she slashed his tyres. 
  Allegedly. 
  How does that connect to Jessica? 
  - Jessica. 
  - Sorry. 
  I don't know, but background's always useful, isn't it? 
  - Cin-cin. 
  - Thank you, Ellie. 
  - Another suspect. 
  - Oh. 
  Who are the others? 
  Nice try. 
  There's a ball at Newnham tomorrow, isn't there? 
  So, when I'm stuck, I try and get on the ground. 
  Immerse myself in the story. 
  If either of you need a date That's not a bad idea. 
  - No. 
  - Fine. 
  Ugly sisters, you go to the ball. 
  But remember who thought of it when you're doling out the exclusives. 
  - BOY: Let go! 
  - Go to bed! 
  - Have you seen my dinner jacket? 
  - Oh, try the dressing up box. 
 
 
 
  Dora? 
  Eh, you couldn't run an iron over it, could ya? 
  I told you, I've got a union meeting tonight. 
  - What, another one? 
  - SHE SIGHS Well, we could always bring my mum in for reinforcements. 
  While we're stretched. 
  - It's not that bad. 
  - Exactly. 
  CHILDREN CONTINUE SHOUTING - Dora! 
  - There you go, then. 
  Have it. 
  Ding-dong! 
  It's Leslie Phillips. 
  Well, I think you look very handsome. 
  Your mother would be very proud. 
  Thank you. 
  Have you had a chance to speak to her yet? 
  Since the other day. 
  I'm sure she's fine. 
  I know you just want her to be happy, Will, but it's not always that easy. 
  She's got everything she needs to live the life she wants. 
  You know, in Morocco it's not uncommon for male friends to hold hands in public. 
  Nobody looks, nobody points or locks you up. 
  You can just walk, hand-in-hand in the street. 
  But here Some people aren't allowed to live the lives they want. 
  Some can't. 
  Well, Mum's not one of them. 
  She just needs to get on with it. 
  But thanks. 
  And still you tell me Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you don't make Your mind up I always wondered what these things were like. 
  Pleased to see my taxes are being well spent. 
  I told you they're ridiculous. 
  If they saved half this money, they could double the amount of scholarships. 
  - It is nice, though. 
  - I know. 
  - It's like Eden. 
  - Gentlemen. 
  Thank you. 
  Confess but please don't tell me Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps So, how do you wanna play this? 
  Hmm. 
  Just mingle. 
  Look out for anything suspicious. 
  Them. 
  Any bullying from the girls. 
  Oh, and pills. 
  Larry had them tested. 
  American Benzedrine. 
  Imported. 
  Will. 
  Wait. 
  It's a drinking game. 
  You get penny-ed, you have to down the drink. 
  Oh, you can keep that. 
  As a tip. 
  We'll never get started Sha-la-la-la-la - I don't wanna wind up - Sha-la-la-la Being parted, broken-hearted Would you like to dance, Vicar? 
  That's a nice way to talk. 
  Besides, you're celibate. 
  - Really? 
  - Will you stop opening with that? 
  What about you, Inspector? 
  I'm celibate too. 
  I didn't have you down as the religious type. 
  I'm not, I'm married. 
  So if you really love me Say yes And if you don't dear confess But please don't tell me Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Perhaps, perhaps Perhaps. 
  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Pah-rah-rah-rah-rah Pah-rah-rah-dun Pah-pah-pah-rah-dah-rah I didn't think you had to be celibate in the Church of England. 
  You don't. 
  I'm just waiting for the right person at the right time. 
  I'm in the mood for love Simply because you're near me - Ma'am? 
  - Inspector. 
  I heard you were here. 
  Any news on the case? 
  Can you show me what's in your hand, please? 
  I don't see it's any of your business. 
  I have reason to believe you may be distributing drugs, which could be linked to the death of one of your students. 
  Drugs? 
  Prophylactics. 
  I can't stop these girls having s*x, but I can encourage them to take precautions and to consider their futures. 
  - This little dream - This little dream I know what it's like, trying to fit in here. 
  Especially if it's strict at home. 
  You get carried away. 
  Obviously, Jessica had a line she wouldn't cross. 
  - She did. 
  - What was she really like, Vronky? 
  I mean, so far we've got pills, garters, rumours about boys. 
  She was good. 
  I don't think any of this is down to her. 
  Vicar. 
  There's someone in Jess' room. 
  There. 
  DOOR SQUEAKS Matthew, what are you doing? 
  - Hey! 
  - Get off me! 
  - What's this? 
  - It was my dad's. 
  What was it doing in Jessica's room? 
  Hmm? 
  You told us you'd only met Jessica a handful of times. 
  But you'd been in her room. 
  - They made us. 
  - Who? 
  The girls. 
  They made us go into her room. 
  - For what? 
  - What do you think? 
  But we didn't. 
  Jess said she didn't want to, so we didn't do anything at all. 
  Why were they so desperate for you to do it in the first place? 
  That's how they qualify to join The Valkyries. 
  Sleep with boys, collect trophies. 
  It's what they were trying to bury. 
  I don't know why she wanted to join 'em. 
  But she did. 
  That's why I gave her the cufflink, so she could say that we'd been together. 
  What is this? 
  American? 
  My dad was a GI. 
  Stationed at Bassingbourn. 
  He died at Normandy. 
  Why should we believe you? 
  I mean, why would you even go along with them? 
  Forcing you into her room. 
  They said they'd stitch me up if I didn't. 
  Stitch you up for what? 
  The bennies. 
  You got them from the American base. 
  Some of my dad's pals, they settled here after the war. 
  They get them from the States. 
  I gave a few to Jess, she said she wanted something to help her stay up late, to study. 
  But then the rest of them found out and they wanted them too. 
  So you broke into her room to cover your tracks. 
  No. 
  No, I wanted the cufflink back. 
  So that no-one thought Jess was something that she wasn't. 
  She was a nice girl. 
  Not like the rest. 
  The Valkyries are supposed to be about sisterhood. 
  Empowerment, not tawdry fumbles for trinkets and cufflinks. 
  So, what, girls have to sleep with 10, 20 boys to join your little gang? 
  It's not just about quantity, Inspector. 
  A policeman wouldn't be worth as much as a vicar, for example. 
  I'm surprised at you, Heather. 
  Grow up. 
  You grow up. 
  I mean, all this rubbish about connections and jobs for the girls. 
  You only got the job here because they wouldn't have you anywhere else. 
  That's what it's really like. 
  Isn't it? 
  Be honest. 
  We can have degrees, but at the end of the day, we're all gonna be someone's wife in five years' time. 
  Popping out kids and organising charity lunches. 
  No. 
  It doesn't have to be that way. 
  No. 
  It doesn't have to. 
  But it probably will be, won't it? 
  So we may as well enjoy this bit while we can. 
  It doesn't mean we killed anyone. 
  So much for Eden, then. 
  Oh, I don't know. 
  Maybe Heather's right. 
  If that's all these girls think they can hope for, then maybe parties and tawdry fumbles and getting drunk for a few years is some kind of Eden. 
  Worked for me for a while. 
  Doesn't sound that bad when you put it like that. 
  But it was, though. 
  I wasn't happy. 
  I thought I was doing it all wrong, that I had to try harder. 
  Anything to be part of the gang. 
  You all right? 
  My pocket square. 
  - KNOCKING - Vronky? 
  Vronky? 
  Rubbish. 
  You never got anywhere near him. 
  No, it's true. 
  It was amazing. 
  Fine. 
  Let's ask him. 
  Vicar. 
  Is it true that you broke your vow of celibacy with Vronky here? 
  She must have taken it while we were dancing. 
  Veronika, could we have a word? 
  No, but I did other things. 
  Oh, Ollie and Alastair told us about that. 
  ALL CHUCKLE Hardly the behaviour of a Newnham lady, let alone a Valkyrie. 
  - That's not fair. 
  - Veronika. 
  You can't make the rules then take them back. 
  We need to talk to you about Jessica's murder. 
  - Shall we go to my study? 
  - No, I'm here with my friends. 
  We know you want to be part of the group and maybe you felt that Jessica let you down by leaving you with those boys. 
  And you were upset, ashamed. 
  No, it was an accident. 
  You tried to make it look like one. 
  We We were drunk. 
  She left me with them. 
  It's supposed to be a sisterhood. 
  We're supposed to stick together, it was supposed to be a funny story, but it wasn't. 
  It was disgusting. 
  I didn't mean to kill her. 
  I just I was just so angry. 
  At them, at Jess. 
  at myself. 
  Jess! 
  I didn't know what to do, so I I just threw her into the river. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I just BREATHING SHAKILY I just wanted her to feel how I felt. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Veronika Fitzpatrick. 
  I'm arresting you for the murder of Jessica Hall. 
  You have the right to remain It's those boys you should be locking up. 
  Veronika is a victim here too. 
  She killed someone and tried to cover it up. 
  What else can I do? 
  Vicar. 
  The court will take everything into account. 
  A man in a wig judging how a young woman might feel in that situation. 
  That's not fair. 
  INHALING SHARPLY Andrea's right, you know. 
  It's not just Vronky. 
  It's the whole thing. 
  I know. 
  If I had my way, I'd lock them all up. 
  Berserkers, Valkyries. 
  - Matthew? 
  - He withheld evidence. 
  I've no choice with him either. 
  - What about sending him to Vic? 
  - That's for minor offences. 
  This is something much more serious, Will. 
  What if I vouch for him? 
  Personally. 
  The church puts up some funding, it should hold some sway. 
  Geordie, he's been to Borstal, it didn't work. 
  Vic's Victors does. 
  And if it doesn't, you can blame me. 
  - Thanks. 
  - KNOCKING - Oh, postman's early. 
  - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. 
  That's not the postman. 
  - It's the cavalry. 
  - SHE EXHALES This hallway needs a good scrub. 
  - Nana! 
  - Oh, Esme! 
  Mam. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I phoned her. 
  There's no point in us complaining me complaining about having too much on all the time. 
  Might as well do what we can to fix it. 
  You look thin, love. 
  Problem solved. 
  Looking good, Mum. 
  SHE CHUCKLES Well, like you said, it's time I made a fist of it. 
  I'm sorry about lunch the other week. 
  I know things maybe aren't as easy as I'd like them to be. 
  They might be for you, you're young and you're a man. 
  Well, don't forget talented. 
  You're happy. 
  I'm glad. 
  Well, you can be happy too. 
  Maybe not straightaway, but Well, actually, erm Actually, I'm feeling the best I have done for a very long time. 
  I met someone over lunch at The Savoy and erm, he took me to the races at Ascot last week. 
  His name's St John. 
  St John Gurney-Clifford. 
  He doesn't like to use his title. 
  Well, that's great. 
  I'd love you to meet him. 
  Maybe Maybe at his estate in Norfolk. 
  Being cast out of Eden left us hopeless, despairing. 
  Craving a return to a place that was lost. 
  But even though Jesus died to cleanse us of our sins we still find ways to sin against each other. 
  To live in guilt and shame. 
  But I refuse to believe it'll be this way. 
  By God's grace we can be forgiven. 
  And we too can forgive. 
  All right? 
  You all good? 
  And in turn find the hope for the world we want to live in.
