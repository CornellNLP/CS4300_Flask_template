 You ain't caught us and I'm just a plumber from Walsall. 
 Reporter : 'What is the balance between liberty and security? The country may not be convinced that this mass infringement of privacy is a price worth paying.' 
 Britain, 2015 - one of the most watched nations on earth. 
 In a country where everything we do leaves a trail, 14 ordinary citizens are going on the run. 
 I've got the laptop, I've got socks and pants, I've got toiletries. Whisky! 
Have you got the whisky? 
 Run! 
 What the BLEEP? 
 Everything feels like it's closing in on you, you just don't know which way to run. 
 I don't feel safe at all right now. 
 Hunting the fugitives down, 30 of the world's most successful investigators. 
 We have eyes absolutely everywhere. 
 The cat's getting a lot closer to the mouse at the moment. 
 (There's somebody there.) 
 The psychological pressures will play mind tricks with you. 
 She could be ringing them now. 
 And that gives us an advantage. 
 I really miss you guys today. 
 28 days... 
 Have a password, that's all I want. 
 ..14 fugitives. 
 We've got to get this guy. 
 We know where you are. 
 If you had to disappear, what would you do? 
 You need to stop right now. 
 You are surrounded! 
 Three weeks ago, 14 fugitives went on the run. 
 From a secret headquarters in London, some of the world's best man hunters are tracking them down. 
 Infiltrating their lives... 
 CCTV sighting, 120 Acre Road. 
 ..they've captured 10 of the 14 so far. 
 Hands up! Hands up! 
 The train is now in at platform three. 
 Dr Allen? 
 Is that the backpack there? 
 Yeah. There we go. 
 Run, run! Stop, stop! 
 Now in the final week, four fugitives remain at large. 
 Still on the run, IT manager Martin Cole... 
 I think I've got it, I've got it. 
 'We've got the skills there to do it but I think without this friendship,' we could ultimately struggle. 
 ..and heating engineer Stephen Hardiker. 
 There's swans stopping us. 
 'The idea of being on the run with everyone after you,' 
 I get excited now just thinking about it. 
 Martin has used his IT skills to contact home undetected. 
 "Hello all. We are all fine, safe and well." 
 To save money, they have been wild camping and cycling everywhere... 
 ♪ Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run. ♪ 
 ..staying off radar for three weeks. 
 Hardiker and Cole. I want to freeze their bank accounts. 
 Deputy Peter Bleksley is a former undercover detective with the Met Police. 
 He's planning a new course of action against Stephen and Martin. 
 My thinking being, we haven't had any cash withdrawals for some considerable time. 
 Crank up the pressure. Make them skint. 
 It's a legitimate tactic. 
 Their plan will need money. Will need resources. 
 Freezing their bank gives us many options to find them. 
 They may think it's a problem with the ATM and use a different ATM. 
 Each time they do that we're going to know exactly where they are. 
 If I give you a fiver, would you take me up to the petrol station and drop me back here? 
 Stephen and Martin haven't used a cash machine since their first day on the run. 
 Now, with a week to go, they decide to top up their funds. 
 Suspecting the ATM will have CCTV, Stephen hitches a lift in a stranger's van as a decoy. 
 (ATM beeps) 
 "Your account has insufficient funds." 
 They've taken... There's no money on that one. Try the other cards? 
 (ATM beeps) 
 What's going on? 
 ATM, Hardiker and Cole, cards were rejected. 
 So, this is where they were. 
 Get all the information you can on that location. 
 So sorry. No money in the bank. 
 sh1t. 
 Hardiker and Cole. 'CCTV.' 
 Five minutes. 
 We need you to divert to Oswestry. 
 Hardiker and Cole. ATM. Esso Service Station. 
 CCTV footage in Oswestry. It's a minivan. 
 There's Hardiker there. 
 They took our money off us. What a bunch of bastards. 
 I tell you what, the good thing about that drop, although we were unsuccessful with the money was that we used a hired minibus, so a little bit more hard work for them to trace that person driving that minibus. 
 We do have the name and the phone number of the person that rented that vehicle. 
 HQ have traced the mobile phone number of the driver who rented the van. 
 Rebecca Duffield we firmly believe has helped the fugitives get away from the ATM. 
 Last location data for her handset. 
 Oswestry. Queens Head pub. 
 Detective Sergeant Mark Cannoner arrives on the scene to investigate. 
 So, there is a camera directly outside of the pub which would capture fugitives. 
 That will then allow us to narrow down our field of movement. 
 We've got positive sightings of Hardiker and Cole. 
 Footage shows the fugitives travelling along the canal on bicycles in a north-easterly direction. 
 Right, let's get some maps up, let's try tracking that. 
 You know what to do. 
 They're using the canal network with bikes. 
 They've chosen a very good means of getting round the country. 
 They can come off and go on the towpath any time they want. 
 So, really smart. 
 So, Montgomery Canal was there. Oswestry is there. 
 They've got to stop somewhere. Either pitch a tent or something. 
 They've got to come off the towpath. 
 Stephen and Martin have arrived at another campsite for the night. 
 Interviewer : How many times have you washed your clothes since you've been on the run? 
 With detergent? Never. 
 34 minutes. 
 An "Ironing Centre". I love it. 
 It is, look. Ironing Centre. 
 Welcome to the Ironing Centre. 
 I'm in the Ironing Centre. 
 Believing the hunters are close, Stephen patrols the perimeter. 
 What's the plan if a big black car, four-by-four, shows up on the barrier? 
 I would dump my bike on that fence and then run and hide to try and make them think that I've run over the field. 
 Watch them, you see. Yeah. 
 And then they're going to go and hunt for you over there. 
 I'm thinking about me family a lot today. 
 I've kept them out of my head for a good few days, actually. 
 I sort of... I don't know, I've gone bad again now in my head. 
 Bad, why? Just, like, worrying about them. 
 Just worrying that, you know, that I'm not there, I'm not being a father. I mean, I know it's only a month and all that but things just creep up on you in your head, don't they? 
 And burn at ya. 
 'I'm missing home now. I'm really getting really homesick.' 
 Missing my family and missing my girlfriend. 
 Missing my dog, I'm just missing just general normal life. 
 'It's tough going. It really is. It's an emotional drain.' 
 'After many weeks on the run, you are physiologically battered.' 
 You are really missing home. The fatigue sets in. You're very tired. 
 All your anxieties, your paranoia, it is completely skewing your mind-set. 
 I actually don't even like being on this road for sure. 
 Want to turn around? Yeah. 
 Right, two people we're interested in have come through this way. 
 I think they're actually in this area on a couple of bikes. 
 OK. Erm, if you do see them, give us a ring. 
 At HQ, time is running out to catch the fugitives. 
 The cyber team are in need of a breakthrough. 
 Hardiker and Cole, guys? 
 What have we got? Time's ticking. 
 What have we got? 
 We've managed to get into Jessica Woodhall's iCloud account. 
 What we really want to do is try and get into her Twitter account because we can see she's got that really locked down and we suspect that they may be using that as a communication medium. 
 Come on, have a password. Have a password. That's all I want. 
 The team search Jessica's messages for the password to her Twitter account. 
 In 2012, she sent a message, "Hi, Mum. My password is lollipop." 
 We may now be in Jessica Woodhall's Twitter. 
 Oh, well done, Doug! 
 Doug Episel discovers a private message between her and a user called Smith123Alfie. 
 The Twitter handle for the dog. 
 S says, "Is S OK? He misses everyone dearly." 
 Alfie is a very happy puppy too. 
 She's telling me something that I know. 
 Man Legends, that's what we call ourselves. Man Legends. 
 "Don't accept any friend requests for your information. I will hide Twitter for as long as I can. Be safe. We love you millions." 
 So that's from Sad. 
 That's Sadia. 
 That one's from Jessie. 
 "Thanks for info. All is good. These pups miss their families." 
 Tweet? Yeah, tweet. I think that means our family love us. 
 Of course they love us, you dick. 
 Nice. Does that mean we've got a life to go back to? 
 We'll check this again in the morning. 
 Meet Timothy. 
 20 days ago, best friends Emily Dredge and Lauren English went on the run. 
 We'll share food. We'll share sleeping arrangements. 
 But after two weeks, they went their separate ways. 
 My friends say that I tend not to finish anything. 
 So, for me, getting to the end is very important. 
 Emily risked it all for a chance to see her baby, Ernest. 
 We need to go right now. 
 And escaped from the hunters. 
 She's now at a caravan park in Kent. 
 Hello. 
 I'm just looking, without moving too much, I'm looking for somewhere to stay for the night? 
 We might be able to help, might we? 
 Do you know anyone that can rent us a room for a few days? 
 And hide us? You could just come back with us? 
 We've got a big enough house. 
 Oh, my God. I love that so much. 
 I can have a shower. 
 The family live just down the road. 
 Oh, this is so nice. Thank you. 
 This is lovely. 
 'I feel stable at the moment. A lovely family has taken me in and making me feel really at home. It gets very lonely when you're running away. It's just that this is the last week and so it should be getting easier but it's not. 
 I feel like I can't be safe anywhere because there is always a way that they can track you. 
 The last thing I'd want to do right now is keep running. 
 HQ continue to monitor telephones belonging to Emily's friends and family. 
 Yeah, I know but I'm going to have to run away now because I've tripped up and used the phone. 
 I know, but I just needed to see how Ernest was. 
 The hunters soon receive notification of a call made to Christopher Lees, the father of her son, from a number registered to Dawn Blackmore. 
 We can look at her friends. 
 Can't find any connection between Dawn Blackmore and Chris Lees. 
 So, she's not an obvious immediate associate. 
 Emily has frequently used other people's phones to call both Christopher and Paula. 
 Could this have been a one touch call? 
 Let's hope that our fugitive Emily Dredge is with Dawn Blackmore's phone. 
 I want a cell site to try and identify where that phone is. 
 It's Emily's final week on the run. 
 She borrowed a phone belonging to her accomplice, Dawn Blackmore... 
 'Are you almost there?' 
 ..but the hunters were monitoring the call. 
 Let's hope Emily Dredge is with Dawn Blackmore's phone. 
 Shall we just go? 
 Yeah, come on. 
 OK, come on, let's go, kids. 
 Come on, we've got to go. 
 Think about the call that you made. 
 What are you thinking about it now? 
 They probably will come, but we'll be gone by then. 
 Where's the car? Up here. 
 Dawn is relocating Emily to a new hideout. 
 Where are we going, Emily? 
 We're going to Canterbury to stay with Marnie, Dawn's daughter. 
 So we're just going to switch location. 
 (Text alert) 
 I'm really concerned because you keep getting hundreds of missed calls on your mobile. 
 I've had three no caller IDs, but that could be a client calling me from a work number. 
 Next one that comes up, I'll just answer it. 
 Do I? 
 Yeah. Do I? Yeah. 
 Dawn's phone connected to the network. 
 Dawn's phone, the one that's been in contact with Chris, we've got information on where it is. 
 They're driving. 
 Primarily, we're looking for Emily Dredge and we are working on the theory that Emily is with that phone. 
 David Blakely and his team pick up the trail. 
 I'm no further use to you at all, because I'm going to be followed wherever I go now. 
 If anyone asks, say that you were in the pub. 
 Yeah. Good idea. 
 'I've taken cell site for you, David.' 
 That is the cell site five minutes ago you said for Dawn, yes? 
 'Yes, yes.' 
 OK, understand. Heading to that postcode now. 
 'She's close to us. She is close to us.' 
 We are now heading west. 
 f*ck, traffic! She's close to us. She is close to us. 
 Distance there, Becs? Do the distance from where you are now. 
 Peter, what I'm going to do... 11 minutes. f*ck! f*ck, mate. 
 She's 11 minutes away from us. 
 Based on what speed? 
 What are we doing? 70mph? 
 I don't know where to go or what to do. 
 This is another person's house. 
 Student Marnie and her housemate Jack are out for the day. 
 Oh, it's such a lovely house, isn't it? 
 It's your new home. Yay! 
 Are you going to stay with us till they get back? 
 No, cos I've got a client in, like, half an hour. 
 Cell site data shows Dawn's phone stationary in Canterbury. 
 Thank you so much for looking after me. 
 Enjoy. Make yourself a cup of tea. 
 Oh, key! 
 Give that to Marnie. OK, cool. Bye! 
 David. It would appear that phone is now disconnected from the network. 
 For the amount of time that it was static, we are thinking that it was a drop-off - 
 Canterbury East railway station. 
 Mate, have any trains left in the last 15 minutes? 
 Nothing within the last 15 minutes. Really? Thanks, mate. 
 It's a negative, yeah? 
 'When the trail goes cold, we review all the information. We review what we already have to predict where that person is likely to go next.' 
 Sometimes by searching the profiles of those people and the people around them, you can often find that information out. 
 I don't feel like they could find me. 
 I feel like I'm moving around enough and the patterns are so weird and odd that, you know, it's just unpredictable. 
 To have them constantly on your back is a much easier thing for me as an individual. 
 I'd rather be actively moving, otherwise you start to think too much, get paranoid. 
 You start to behave very inward and your emotions become trapped inside you. 
 And you sort of start to feel yourself going crazy. 
 Since they've split, Lauren seems to have completely disappeared off our radar. 
 She's taken out no money. Not been seen on any CCTV cameras. 
 Although it's worked, that's not running. 
 That's just staying very still in a dark room. We could all do that. 
 Now running alone. 
 Is there any chance of a lift? 
 Don't get caught. 
 Do I look like somebody who is going to get caught? No! 
 I could be free, being on the run. 
 Sometimes, time out from reality is really welcomed. 
 Lauren English has hitch-hiked her way to Wales... 
 Well, nobody comes here so you're fine. 
 ..where she has befriended two new accomplices, Angela... and Beryl. 
 Hello, Beryl! How are you doing? 
 Nice to meet you. 
 You kind of always end up somewhere really lovely. 
 You've got to hope that somebody that we put our trust in is going to look after us. 
 You can't actually relax, if that makes sense? 
 There is always the dark shadow and the fear of somebody tapping me on the shoulder, you know, it's like... It's horrible. 
 Lauren spots a suspicious car approaching her mountain hideout. 
 It's Beryl. 
 You know when you're talking about something? 
 I have just seen a big black 4x4. 
 What's Beryl's car? 
 It's blue and battered. 
 Oh, my God! 
 We're losing the plot. 
 Lauren is proving elusive to the hunters so HQ adopt a new tactic. 
 I'm thinking along the lines of doing as targeted a media campaign as we can. 
 With less then a week to go, they decide to use this strategy on all remaining fugitives. 
 Morning, Buzz. 
 Morning, Peter. 
 I would like you to collect some "wanted" posters that we've had printed. 
 One way or another, rattle the cages. 
 We're trying to provoke a reaction. 
 Is there a ?250 reward like there was for Ricky Allen? 
 There certainly is. 
 This tactic was highly effective in the hunt for Ricky Allen. 
 It is very disconcerting for a fugitive if they pick up the paper to see their own face staring back at them. 
 It makes them realise just how concerted an effort there may be in trying to catch them. 
 Switch Radio, putting out an appeal to the public to bring forward any information they might have about these guys. 
 This is a hack, so we've got full control of it. We can upload photos. 
 I'm going to change his profile picture that everyone can see to the "wanted" poster that we've put out for him. 
 Posters are going to go out everywhere. 
 Hostels, budget hotels, pubs, local public, you name it, they've all got posters. 
 If you know where he is, give us a ring. You get 250 quid. 
 Can you just have a look at those men and tell me if you've seen them cycling on this footpath? 
 We're forcing them into panicking and making mistakes. 
 I want them to panic. 
 Let's flush them out. 
 Most of our friends have commented on the pic of your "wanted" poster. 
 All right, let's have a look at your Facebook picture. 
 To conceal their location, Martin uses a virtual private network. 
 f*cking hell, it's me and you! 
 "Appeal for information. Have you seen these men? Appeal for information. Stephen and Martin, please contact us if you spot them." 
 Very clever. Very, very clever. You sneaky pup. 
 They've hacked into my Facebook. 
 They've changed my profile picture to a "wanted" poster of me and Martin saying that there is reward out. 
 Definitely can't contact any friends. 
 'I can feel 'em now. I can feel like I can feel 'em breathing down my neck. Really can. I can feel them close. Closing the net in.' 
 It has made me nervous because I really, really want to get to the end of this. 
 I am so determined to do this now. Nothing's going to stop me. 
 Shut up. Where is that? 
 I'm thinking I might ring Angela. 
 Yeah, and get out of here tonight? 
 Well, now. Yeah. 
 I'll take you and liaise with her. 
 What does it say? 
 That's in town now. That's in this town. 
 Right, we've got to go. Pack your stuff, George, we're on the run. 
 Stephen Hardiker and Martin Cole have discovered there's a price on their heads. 
 As they near the end of their time on the run, they change tactics. 
 Make sure this bike goes to a good home. I am very, very sad. 
 This bike has served me well. 
 It's took us all morning to make this decision and I think sometimes separations are just done quickly. 
 Tearfully : Just going to say goodbye. You hate that bike. 
 I'll see you in about 15 minutes on that road. 
 
 
 
 Lots of cameras earlier. 
 That's a big old camera there. 
 It's funny, when you're in a town centre, everything feels like it's closing in on you. 
 You know, you've got cars, CCTV. 
 You're just not sure where you're being looked at. 
 It's a really weird feeling. 
 You're like a rat in the bottom of a barrel, you just don't know which way to run. 
 Suddenly you get out into the open, you feel free again. 
 Stephen, Martin, Emily and Lauren have escaped capture for 26 days. 
 But with just 48 hours to go... 
 ..the fugitives have been told they must end their time on the run via a secret extraction point. 
 At the same time, Chief Brett Lovegrove is informed the fugitives will be making an imminent bid for freedom. 
 The hunt for the fugitives will end 1200 hours midday Sunday, 31st May, 2015. 
 Any remaining fugitives still on the run will make a bid for an extraction point, a single extraction point somewhere in mainland UK. 
 We've got to find out where that is. 
 Private boat to get them down the Thames, out into the Channel and away. 
 No passport control. No immigration control. 
 Airports. 
 Yeah, you've got private airports. 
 Again, the back of a van and off to an airfield potentially. 
 Centre of the country? 
 Somewhere that's accessible from all directions. 
 If a fugitive leaves the UK, your problems multiply. 
 Different police forces, different legal systems, different jurisdictions, all throw up challenges of their own. 
 Unless they've got the right networks, the right associates, it's very hard to get out of a main transport hub - airports, for example. 
 Private ones, maybe there's a better chance, but a main airport hub, it would be very difficult unless you had the right false documentation. 
 Air, I don't particularly fancy. 
 Passport checks, all ports warnings, all that sort of stuff. 
 Same for rails, St Pancras. 
 River, I quite fancy. 
 No passport checks, no immigration checks. 
 On a boat, out into the Channel and away to a life of freedom thereafter. 
 In less than two days, the fugitives will attempt to reach an extraction point. 
 What the hunters don't know is that the fugitives must make their escape on a private aircraft from Fairoaks Airport in Surrey. 
 But they won't be safe until the plane is in the air. 
 We are actually a stone's throw away from that airport. Fairoak... 
 ..Airport. It's quite close to us, this is, Martin. 
 I mean, airfields normally have great camping things around them cos there ain't that many houses, is there? 
 We've got to find a camping spot which is close enough to it, but out the way. 
 We need to work out our route to it, where we can camp by it, access to it, access from it. 
 We need to plan this. This is military planning. 
 Plan this to precision. 
 I mean, a f*cking plane, man. 
 That's James Bond style. 
 OK. Let's go. 
 More then 200 miles away and still spooked by the wanted poster, Lauren lays low in her remote hideaway. 
 You're not safe until you're aboard that plane. 
 Nearly a free woman, Lauren. Nearly. 
 How weird is that? I always thought I'd be free, being a runaway. 
 I've learnt the complete and utter opposite. 
 Do you think Angela will drop us there? Yeah, no problem. 
 I just don't want to get caught. 
 We can't get caught. 
 In Kent, Detective Sergeant Mark Cannoner has tracked down Emily's new friend, Dawn Blackmore. 
 Hi, there. Hiya, you all right? 
 How you doing? 
 Former Detective Sergeant Karen Hunt leads the questioning. 
 Right, Dawn, can you talk me through your day and how you came to meet this lady? 
 Went to the Harvester for a few drinks with my husband. 
 Whereabouts is that, then? 
 Just over there. Right. 
 So on this road, is it? 
 Yeah. Yeah. It's just literally over there. 
 There was a young girl in there and she looked a bit distressed and she asked if she could use my phone, so I said yeah. 
 And you said yes straightaway? Yeah. 
 We know for a fact that you and she were in Canterbury yesterday. 
 I didn't go to Canterbury. 
 She doesn't want to give her up. 
 She will lie for her. 
 And I said, "You're not telling the truth," and she said, "Well, I'm not going to say anything else." 
 So she's lying. She is lying through her teeth. 
 Dawn Blackmore. Yes. 
 One of the places that she visits is Canterbury Christ Church University. 
 So when I click on that, I've done some research around that and then gone back into her friends. 
 Yes. 
 One of the first people that comes up in her friends is Marnie Blackmore, who actually attends... 
 Christ Church University. 
 The Christ Church University. And that's her daughter. 
 Some of the accommodation is in this area here. 
 Still not certain as to where Emily would fit in. 
 She's obviously relying a lot on her ability to charm people and fit in wherever she goes. 
 Hello? Would you still be able to give us a lift or not? 
 As soon as possible. 
 Yeah, as soon as you can do it. 
 So if ten's that, then that's fine. 
 Cheers. 
 All right, I'll see you in a bit. 
 So this is the address of Marnie Blackmore, which is the daughter of Dawn Blackmore, and as you can see it's right in the centre of that triangulation that we had earlier. 
 All right, let's go get her. 
 Emily is on the move again, but this time the hunters are just one step behind. 
 Hiya, is it Marnie? Yeah. 
 Mark. How you doing? 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. 
 So I think we've both got an interest in Emily. 
 I'm not going to tell you. 
 Why is that? 
 Because I want to help Emily. OK. 
 Jack, do you want to come have a chat, mate? 
 How would you feel if I told you that she's met people, she's befriended them and crucially, and digest this bit, she's used them? 
 She's keeping all her money to herself and she's what I would call freeloading wherever she goes. 
 OK? So she's very manipulative in what's she's doing. 
 There is a reward. 
 ?250 for information that tells me where we can find Emily. 
 Talk to me. 
 I wouldn't have got so far if I wasn't good with people. 
 By trusting people and putting my trust in others, which I never really used to do, I've actually come quite far. 
 By having faith, trust and believe in other people. 
 Did she say what her final destination was? 
 We don't know her. We're not going to see her again. 
 So we might as well take the money. 
 Where was she going to? 
 She's said, she was like, "I've got to get by Sunday to Surrey." 
 Cos I can remember because I was like, "I don't know where that is." 
 And you've given me some fantastic information. 
 I'm really grateful for that. 
 So the money was the incentive? 
 Pretty much. Yeah. 
 Hello, Mark. 
 What she said was that Emily needs to get very near to the Guildford area in Surrey. 
 Marnie's tale. How would you rate it? 
 "Listen, we've never met this girl before. We've got no loyalty towards her. Show me the money." 
 Pure motivation was the cash. 
 You can get complacent as a fugitive. 
 It's very draining and very tiring. 
 Who's your friend? Who's your enemy? Who's onside? Who isn't? 
 Who can you trust? 
 Worried now because they could turn up here any second and... 
 ..that would be really annoying, wouldn't it? 
 I just hope I make it on the plane. 
 The best leads at the moment, we have a conversation with Marnie and the feedback we got from her. 
 Something about going to Surrey. 
 Think this is worth pursuing and decide where best to deploy people. 
 The hunters now have a strong lead on the location of the extraction point. 
 Emily may have jeopardised not just her plan, but the chance for all fugitives to escape from Fairoaks Airport. 
 We have less than 24 hours left. 
 We need to find a single extraction point. 
 Believing the extraction point for the remaining fugitives to be somewhere in Surrey, the hunters focus their investigation on possible escape routes in the area. 
 We're looking at airfields that they could use for an extraction within that area there. 
 I'm turning off military airfields as they wouldn't get on without showing valid ID, turning off disused airfields which narrows us down to those airfields there. 
 It is a chartered aircraft doing the extraction, it could literally be someone that picks him up in their private aircraft and whisks them away. 
 We have four fugitives left to go, would they all be bundled onto the same aircraft? 
 I was looking at the flights. Small jet - it's expensive but you can do it. 
 We've signed up to evade for 28 days. 
 That is your number one priority. If they get ya, it doesn't matter whether they've got you on day 6, day 10, day 12, day 27. 
 They got ya. Simple as. We're going to do this. 
 All we've got to do is not make a silly mistake. 
 With one night left on the run, their route to the extraction point provides an unexpected stroke of luck. 
 Not that far from the airport? 
 No, no. It's just down the road. 
 Are you looking for somewhere to stay tonight? Yeah. 
 I've got a huge garden. That is fantastic. Thank you. Ah, mate. 
 What's your name? I'm David. 
 David. I'm Steve. Martin. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Stephen and Martin have travelled nearly 500 miles on bicycle, foot and public transport. 
 Now they're spending their final night a few miles away from tomorrow's extraction point at Fairoaks Airfield. 
 Fantastic. How lucky is that? 
 Do we feel safe and secure here? 
 Yes. 
 Can we even hide out here until 9.30am? Yes. 
 It's absolutely perfect. 
 Hitchhiking 800 miles around the UK, Lauren has so far evaded capture. 
 Now Angela is driving her to her sister's house in Reading... 
 ..where Lauren is spending her last night less then an hour's drive from the airfield. 
 Where did we lose them? 
 We lost Emily here. 
 Even though we got split up, it's still our experience, you know. 
 We still...we still did all of that, met all of these people and I want to know where she's been. 
 I hope Emily's there. 
 If Ems is there, that would be amazing. 
 Emily's unpredictable behaviour has kept her firmly out of the grasp of the hunters. 
 For nearly four weeks, she has travelled the length of England, covering almost 1,400 miles. 
 She's spending her last night as a fugitive 75 miles away in a room above a pub in Chilham. 
 I'm in a safe place, well, I hope so. 
 I keep going over and over again in my head of what I've possibly done wrong. 
 How they could trace me? 
 But I don't know. 
 I've always given up because things are too hard. 
 I'm not going to do it any more. 
 They're not going to catch me. Not now. Not ever. 
 It's our last night and we are here. 
 You ain't caught us. You ain't caught us. 
 And I'm just a plumber from Walsall. 
 Tomorrow... 
 I'm excited for tomorrow and what's going to happen. 
 But do you know the biggest thing? I get to see Sadiya. 
 I get to see my boys. Ah! My boys. My boys. 
 ♪ It's the final countdown. ♪ 
 How about if we get there and there are no other teams? 
 There will be, mate, I promise you. 
 We have only three hours left. 
 We are going to do a ring round as quick as possible of these airfields to find out flights in and out. 
 All aircraft passenger manifests, specific information about airfields. 
 Farnborough. Blackbush. Fairoaks. All one word. 
 Private and commercial flights leaving the UK must lodge the details of its passengers in a document called a flight manifest. 
 Details of the flight manifest is a great advantage for us. 
 As soon as we see a fugitive's name on that list, it gives us an exact location of the airport and the means of transport. 
 That's when we're going to find them before they leave the country. 
 HQ strategically placed their hunter teams to deploy at short notice. 
 So that does check out as well, then, that flight manifest? 
 If you're flying out the country, it will flag up all fugitives. 
 I feel sick. 
 I've got to take my bag. 
 I don't know how I'm going to do this, George. 
 You can do it, love. Come on, you've done it for 28 days. 
 All you've got to do is just avoid those hunters. 
 Andrew! 
 Having hitched to Surrey, Emily enlists the help of a family friend to drive her to the final destination. 
 Want to avoid that traffic. 
 That would be absolutely awful. 
 I'm starting to feel quite emotional about it, actually. 
 What an adventure. It's coming to an end. 
 We did it, mate. Nearly. Nearly done it. 
 We can't count our blessings yet but we are on the home run. 
 With less then half an hour remaining, HQ receive a passenger list for Fairoaks Airport. 
 Fairoaks. Fairoaks. Where's Fairoaks Airport? 
 It's Fairoaks, Surrey. We've got two. We got all four. 
 Just had a manifest in for Emily Dredge, Lauren English, Stephen Hardiker and Martin Cole. 
 This is on a flight for 12 o'clock. 'Fairoaks Airport.' 
 North of Woking. 
 It's north of Guilford, towards Woking. 
 Fairoaks Airport. 
 Redeploy. Redeploy to Fairoaks Airport. 
 20 minutes out of the centre of Guildford. 
 Dredge, English, Hardiker and Cole. Fairoaks Airport. 
 They requested all the manifests from that airport. 
 Steve, if it's a controlled airport we can get take-off permission denied. 
 Yep. Trying to find out from the airfields. 
 'Hello. It's Ben.' 
 ETA to Fairoaks Airport? 
 We have a minimum journey time of two-zero. Two-zero minutes. 
 So the expectation is we need to delay that plane. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 We're going to get into the back of the Jeep, pull up at the entrance of the airport, jump out the back and just run to the airfield. We can do this. 
 We can do this. 
 Excited. I've got serious butterflies. 
 If the hunters have been watching our location, it's now where we're going to get done. 
 Detective Sergeant Mark Cannoner is closest to the extraction point. 
 This is the main entrance. 
 Andrew : Yeah, yeah, main entrance. 
 Main entrance. 
 This one. This is it. 
 Yep, this is it. 
 You ready, Lauren? Yes. 
 Here. Right here. 
 Go, Lauren! 
 We're close. 
 (They scream)  Come on! 
 Come on. In you get. 
 (Muffled cries) 
 We done it. We done it! 
 WE DID IT! 
 The fugitives are not safe until the aircraft takes off at midday. 
 Dredge, English, Hardiker and Cole are all on that manifest. 
 'The aircraft is Bravo 200.' 
 How far are we away? 
 We're here now. This is it. Jesus, man. 
 The realisation is sinking in, isn't it? 
 OK. Stop. Stop. Stop. Yep. 
 Ready? Yeah. 
 Right. 
 Go this way. Go left. Go left. Go left! 
 Are we the only ones? 
 We're the only ones who made it! 
 (Laughter) 
 No. There's more! 
 There's more. Ah, yes. 
 (She screams excitedly) 
 f*cking hell. We've done it. 
 Just keep an eye out, Karen. OK. Go. 
 (Excited screaming) 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God! 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Oh, my God. Come on! Freedom. 
 Holy f*ck! Out of 14 people, we are the only ones left. Amazing. 
 Steve, take-off request. 
 Any response from that yet? 
 It's an uncontrolled airport. 
 So we can't stop it? 
 I don't know that we can stop it. 
 It's an uncontrolled airport. 
 It needs to be stopped. 
 All : Whoo! 
 Amazing. 
 We're too late. 
 Right, guys, the plane has taken off with the fugitives on board. 
 We've missed them. Good try. But they've moved on. 
 I think going on the run has given me a real kick up the arse to just get on with life. 
 I couldn't let them get me. 
 And that was it. 
 I had my son in the back of my mind driving me on, driving me on, and he's the only reason I think I actually succeeded so long. 
 We shared 28 days on the run. 
 That will stay with us forever. 
 Came looking for adventure, felt that there was something slightly missing in my life and the truth is that the adventure's at home. 
 The state isn't perfect. 
 It is a very complex machine. 
 That machine is working continuously to keep our society safe all the time. 
 It never stops. It never will.
