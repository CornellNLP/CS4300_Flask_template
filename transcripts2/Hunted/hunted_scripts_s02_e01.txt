 (Loud droning) 
 Do you hear that noise? 
 What noise? 
 (Droning continues) 
 What is that? 
 It's following us. Agh! 
 Ten ordinary people from all over Britain are about to become fugitives. 
 Just stand back for me. 
 Put your arms out. 
 (Beeping) 
 Going on the run will be the biggest thing that I will have ever done. 
 (Static beeping) 
 Full of metalwork. 
 I always ask the question, can I still soldier? 
 They have to disappear in one of the most watched countries in the world. 
 I hate authority bearing down on me. 
 You've just got to make sure you leave no trace. 
 My greatest advantage in this is my politeness. 
 Excuse me, sorry. 
 Hello, sorry. 
 Tracking them down is an elite team of hunters... 
 Hack his phone, hack his hardware, search his house. 
 ..armed with the powers of the state. 
 I love you, I love you, I love you. 
 Ayo, turn off the phone. 
 Here we go. Cell site location. 
 Well, get after them! 
 But if they can evade capture for 28 days... 
 Missing the boys. Missing home. 
 ..they will win a share of £100,000. 
 100 grand! 
 To be able to give money to my mum and actually put a deposit down on a house. 
 I want to win, and I want to win in style as well. 
 There's no way you're gonna catch me. 
 (Dogs growl and bark) 
 Got him. Eyes on, eyes on. 
 Come on! 
 Where will they hide? 
 Who will they trust? 
 There's no other lady that I know who would ever ask me to go on the run with her. 
 (Car horn blasts) 
 Stand down! 
 Ten fugitives... 
 28 days... 
 £100,000. 
 Someone's running. 
 What would you do? 
 Stay where you are! 
 This programme contains strong language. 
 (Phone rings) 
 This is Chief. 
 In command of the hunters is former Scotland Yard detective, Peter Bleksley. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, gather round the big screen, please. 
 We're now going to see some footage that was shot at Birmingham city centre at 12.45pm today. 
 Fugitives are on the run. 
 The fugitives have had a 30-minute head start. 
 Two males, they're ex-military. 
 Military. Definitely military. 
 You can tell by their walk, the way they've got the bags on. 
 We think we've got ten fugitives. 
 Six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Ten. 
 Right, let's identify where that was. 
 Let's get CCTV applications in. 
 Let's find out who these people are. 
 After receiving the helicopter footage, the hunters are given the name, age and address of each fugitive, plus a photograph. 
 That one's Kirk Anthony Bowett. 
 And this one, Jeremy Scarratt. 
 We thought this one was definitely ex-military by the way he walks. 
 This one is ex-military, going on his social media profile already. 
 The bad thing is they've got security training. 
 They've got counter-terrorism training, they've got military experience. 
 Absolutely clued up on how to evade detection. 
 The good thing is that they're wearing backpacks - they've got camping equipment on them. 
 Hopefully, that'll help us predict what they're going to do. 
 Right, let's get out of here. 
 The fugitives are allowed to arrange their initial escape. 
 Filming their every move is a covert camera operator, living alongside them. 
 Right, have we got any CCTV applications in yet? 
 We're waiting for CCTV. 
 Great. Let's work out the route they've gone. 
 Head out the city, mate, towards the M6. 
 I think we'll be very efficient and dynamic. 
 Because of our military background, we will push the boundaries regarding risk. 
 The hunters need to be ahead of us. 
 As far as we're concerned, it ain't going to happen. 
 We're going to beat them. 
 We'd like an early capture. 
 I want ground teams to Birmingham to try and pick up the trail and get hot on their tails. 
 HQ has six teams of ground hunters, strategically placed around the UK. 
 Their members have been hand-picked from the best of Britain's military, police and special forces. 
 Message from HQ. Leave immediately. 
 Let's go. 
 We've got some updated intelligence for you. 
 'We've seen what we believe is ten individuals in total' going in all different directions. 
 So you are the closest at the moment to Milk Street in Birmingham. 
 'Get down there, find out what's what, and on transit, we'll have more gen for you, OK?' 
 Roger that, mate. 
 OK, so we've just got through CCTV of Hamish Thoburn and Mikaela Sales. 
 They've run in from this junction, with the warehouses, motorhouse on the corner. 
 I believe that should be, erm, Coventry Street. 
 I'm taking a look at the fact that they were wheeling off suitcases. 
 I'm really intrigued by that. 
 That's not a very... 
 It's not very mobile. 
 It's not very mobile. 
 Go, go, go! 
 I can't help wondering if there's not a decoy there. 
 Go right, go right. 
 You all right, Hamish? 
 Yeah. 
 So I think we need to be very careful about that, making any assumptions based on what we're seeing right there. 
 Really think we're going on the run with a wheelie case? 
 'I'd say Mikaela is probably the brains behind the organisation of the team.' 
 She nags incessantly, she's arrogant, self-opinionated, has the temper of a Tasered tyrannosaurus... 
 And those are just the good things. 
 She's also got some faults. 
 Oh, my God, tell me when you're turning! 
 Have we broadened out the CCTV from that junction they were at? 
 Do we know direction of travel? 
 We're waiting for that. OK. 
 Anna May and Elizabeth Garnett. 
 What do we know, anything? 
 Now what's interesting here is, notice they're both wearing running shoes, trainers. 
 They look like they're getting ready for some outdoors survival, with down jackets, sleeping bags and packsacks Wearing leggings. 
 They're going to freeze to death. 
 Ohhh! 
 Go! 
 Anna, get down. Get down. 
 'I like to think of us like icebergs.' 
 You can see the tip, which is what the hunters are going to see, but then there's so much more underneath. I like it! 
 Is it traffic lights, Mum? 
 I can't see. There's a crossroads sign ahead. 
 Oh, God! 
 'To win a share of 100,000, that would be amazing.' 
 It would mean being able to give some money to my mum to put a deposit down on a house, for example. 
 'I underappreciate her and she does everything for me, and to kind of, like, repay her.' 
 Thanks. Love you. See you. 
 Thank you. Bye! 
 100 grand... 
 They've got every scrap of motivation you could possibly want. 
 They will be very, very determined. 
 And it's up to us to spoil the party. 
 'I've got details on that fugitive - blonde, Lorna Sian Jones. 
 For the next 28 days, the fugitives are required to stay on the move, attempt to throw the hunters off their scent and seek help from family and friends. 
 You all right, mate?! Agggh! 
 Excellent. Let's get a registration on that vehicle, please. 
 On the road! Whoa! 
 What's up? 
 I'm in traffic. 
 That's what you never see in the movies, isn't it? 
 It's gridlock when you're trying to get away. 
 What would Tom Cruise do in Mission: Impossible? 
 He'd find another route! 
 'Since I've been in my 30s, life is suddenly about,' "Oh, you don't have a mortgage," and "Oh, don't you have a boyfriend yet?" 
 And, "Oh," like, "you work in a job where you're just photocopying for a living." 
 'Like, how did it get to this? It's not exciting any more.' 
 These first few minutes are crucial... in this investigation, to move the pieces around the UK, to get these fugitives blocked off. 
 We don't know how they're going to travel, whether it's foot, vehicle, trains, whatever. 
 It would be pretty silly to stay in the Birmingham area, because Birmingham is littered with CCTV. 
 Madu and Ayo. 
 Tesco, Tesco, Tesco. 
 Tesco, Tesco. Cash. 
 Over their time on the run, the fugitives have access to a bank account containing £250. 
 Let me try and take out £100. 
 But every cash withdrawal immediately alerts the hunters. 
 OK, guys, I've just got another ATM video through. 
 Is that a phone? 
 He's got a phone. 
 He's got an iPhone 6. 
 We should get two on the cell dumps, then. 
 So, everybody, you see the value here of broadening out our CCTV searches. 
 So I make no apology for shouting and ensuring we get these done. 
 Hello, Eden. We're on the run. 
 This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to basically be Jack Bauer. 
 I'm sorry that I've missed your birthday, but I will be back soon. 
 'So I really hope that I can show that' 
 I am smarter than the average. 
 Ayo, turn off the phone. 
 Happy birthday, Eden! f*ckin' hell! 
 After an hour, most of the fugitives have fled Birmingham. 
 But there's one who is yet to escape the city. 
 Nick Cummings, a 50-year-old from Taunton, is the only fugitive without a getaway driver. 
 He is carrying a lot of stuff. 
 He's got to get to a vehicle of some description. 
 In his kit, he had a cycling helmet as well. 
 So there's every chance that he's got a bike stashed somewhere nearby, Excuse me, sorry. 
 Hello, sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 I think Ash has just seen CCTV of him getting on a bike. 
 Ashley, have you got confirmed about the bike with Nick Cummings? 
 Yep, it's a confirmed bike for Nick Cummings. Excellent. 
 Every camera in Birmingham is pointed at me right now. 
 But I don't mind, because I'm looking good. 
 I've been a house husband for 17 years, basically. 
 My main job, really, is to look after Tom, who's 16 now. 
 He's on the autistic spectrum. 
 So what would be the best and the worst thing about Dad going? 
 What do you think? 
 The best thing is that you're not here to be generally annoying. 
 Yeah. The worst bit is that Josh will still be here! 
 (They laugh) 
 Come on, puss. 
 'I've never really had a career, whereas Jo is a hard-working GP.' 
 There you go. 
 'So I can't show value. I'm just a guy who spends her money.' 
 Come on, then... 
 'Winning 100,000 will mean' I bring financial value to the family, 'so I do want to succeed at this.' 
 ♪ Everything is beautiful in its own way... ♪ 
 Hello, Steve, Will. 
 So we're about ten minutes off the location of Milk Street, mate. 
 We're just heading into Birmingham now. 
 'OK. Your target, Nicolas Cummings...' 
 He's on a push bike and he's entered a canal path. 
 We're just trying to get that exact location for you. 
 'You're going to be quicker then him in the vehicle to cover him off at the next stop.' 
 Excuse me guys, sorry. 
 Can you tell me which canal this is? 
 Is it the Worcester one or the Grand Union? 
 It's not so much David and Goliath, with me being versus the state, effectively. 
 Erm, it's David's slack mate versus Goliath. 
 Right, we're going the wrong way, but no longer. 
 (He chuckles) 
 He's going to be going slower than the guys. 
 He's carrying a lot of stuff. 
 This could be a quick win. 
 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. 
 Hi, Ben, we've arrived at Barker Bridge overlooking the canal, mate. 
 'We've got intelligence to suggest Nick Cummings isn't far from your location along that canal path. So just prepare yourselves to get hold of him as he comes through.' 
 I don't know if you can see that, Ben, but that's Steve moving into position now. 
 'Yeah, I can see that. Thanks, Will.' 
 In position, Will. Standing by. 
 'OK, Will, we've got CCTV footage of Nick Cummings wearing a boiler suit, brown work boots and a beanie.' 
 Roger that. 
 OK, well, I'm going into my first disguise, which is basically... Day-Glo. 
 (He chuckles) 
 So we're going to hide in plain sight. 
 We're going to dress up as a builder, engineer sort of bloke. 
 Stevie B. And we're going to change our appearance as much as possible, as simply as possible. 
 So, hopefully, they think they know what I look like, and now I don't. 
 But Nick's disguise doesn't work. 
 He's spotted again on CCTV heading towards the hunters. 
 'Will, just received CCTV footage from ops. 
 'That's the last shot of the fugitive, mate. 
 'It looks like he's changed his appearance. 
 He's got quite a large high-vis jacket on.' 
 This could be bloody brilliant. 
 It really could. 
 I've got a possible now coming towards you, Steve. 
 Are you receiving? 
 Standing by. 
 A high-vis jacket. 
 Five, four... Cancel, cancel. 
 That's a negative on Nick Cummings. 
 Negative on Nick Cummings. 
 I've lost the canal again. 
 Unwittingly, Nick's given the hunters the slip by coming off the canal path and getting lost in the city centre. 
 Sorry, guys, sorry to bother you. 
 Can you tell me how to get to the Worcester Canal from here at all? 
 There's no signs of him. 
 Erm, we've missed him. 
 'That is bloody gutting. 
 'OK. Speak soon.' 
 Roger. 
 He's not going to last 28 days on that bike. 
 You can't cycle far, cos that's so impractical in those big shoes. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 He's going rural, probably. 
 We just don't know. 
 I can't decide if he is really much more sophisticated then we're giving him credit for. 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 Or if he is as inept as he comes across. 
 This, I like. 
 (He laughs) 
 Our lane. And this is the M5, and this is really cool. 
 Because this means... 
 Wales, basically. 
 So we'll get over this. 
 Cracked the hardest bit. 
 I've got away, touch wood, so far. 
 OK, ladies and gentlemen, we need Trench Street, Coventry Street, Flood Street in Birmingham. 
 Treat it as a priority, please. Yep. 
 So make sure you full-coordinate and that every single area around that building is covered. 
 We now have ten fugitives split over what appears to be six groups. 
 Get the request in for bank details. 
 That's definitely a blue SUV. 
 That is an incredibly high workload for any group of investigators, detectives, intelligence gatherers whatsoever. 
 We're under the cosh. 
 Whiskey, India, Sierra... 
 Chief Peter Bleksley leads his team with the help of two deputies - 
 Ben Owen and Louisa Clarke. 
 We're nearly in the Romford address, we're very nearly in one of the London addresses, which is Ayo and Madu's. 
 'I trained as a sniper before I joined the British Intelligence Services,' and I led operations to track down terrorists to stop them carrying out attacks in the UK and aboard. 
 We haven't got an awful lot on Mikaela at the moment. 
 Mikaela and Hamish - we know that they got into a blue van. 
 'I served as an officer in British Military Intelligence for just over a decade,' serving in both Northern Ireland and Afghanistan, and I also served in GCHQ for a couple of years. 
 He's got a Twitter profile, by the way. 
 Ex-military, definitely. 
 Brilliant. 
 The hunters have 28 days to track the fugitives down. 
 It's fast and furious, but also we need to be really disciplined in terms of actually tracking what we're doing so we don't duplicate or thread on each other's toes. It's all about being composed, working together collectively. 
 And then we'll get them. 
 Kirk Bowett and Jeremy Scarratt. 
 Last seen on CCTV getting into a Volkswagen Passat. 
 We've requested who the vehicle's registered to, and that is an Olaf Jones. Right, OK. 
 Well, as far as I'm concerned, Jones is a getaway driver, and he will be treated accordingly. 
 We're heading towards the M6 now, which way do you want to go? 
 Right, don't actually go on the M6. 
 So I'm going to stay on the A38, then? 
 Stay on the A38, yeah. We're going back close to where I live. 
 I know the area very well - I've got a load of assets in the area. 
 And we can start taking the fight back to the enemy. 
 So it looks like we're identified a social media profile for Kirk Bowett. 
 He was an amputee. He had hashtag amputee in his profile. 
 Obviously lost his left arm, part of his left arm. Yeah. 
 I've actually got to the point where I'm biting my lip through anxiety. 
 'I was injured working out in Iraq in 2013.' 
 My vehicle experienced an explosion. 
 It was flipped into the desert about 50 to 60 feet, and the vehicle rolled about four or five times. 
 I think at that time I said, "Goodbye." 
 I said goodbye to my family. 
 I broke my back. My leg had to be reconstructed, and I lost my arm at the forearm. 
 So I am a left below-elbow amputee. 
 So we think Kirk Bowett's wife is Carol Bowett. 
 He's a very proud father. 
 He's got two very young children, both under the age of five years old. 
 That could be a consideration. 
 'Five minutes to bedtime. It's changed me as a person, definitely.' 
 And it's changed my goals in life. 
 'I want to live for now. I want to have the kids, I want to bring them up.' 
 Bedtime, me hearties. 
 Ever since then, it's been fight, fight, fight, fight, you know? 
 And here we are now - we're back at it. 
 Just keep an eye out for cameras, Jez. 
 My name is Jez Scarratt. 
 I joined the Royal Marines in 1975, left in 1990. 
 So what we've got here is an audio clip of Jez Scarratt? 
 I think it's just audio, yeah. 
 Lost my lower right leg below the knee in a motorbike accident, just before the Falklands War. 
 Donna needs this. Yeah, yeah. 
 Get this to Donna. 
 See you later. We're all rooting for you, you know that, don't you? 
 Cheers. 
 Yeah, yeah. Don't screw this up. 
 Cheers, matey. 
 My initial reaction is that there's something slightly angry about him. 
 Yeah. Fed up with the desk job. 
 Running until about eight years ago, but then he's back and his hip's gave out. 
 So he probably sees this as being a very significant event. 
 Oh-ho! 
 The fugitives are hiding out on a country estate. 
 Helping them is Simon Dumant, who's served in the Special Forces. 
 We plan to evade capture via a group of veterans around the country. 
 We've served together in the past. 
 Soldiers stick together. 
 Oh! 
 'We do look after each other's backs, like we did in action.' 
 Dinner's ready. 
 I find fugitives with a military background are brilliant to engage with because they have had training in escape and evasion - something that I share. It means that they have that certain mind-set. 
 Not that they are predictable, but there is a commonality of planning that we can exploit. 
 The Chief brings in Jez and Kirk's getaway driver, Olaf Jones. 
 Olaf believes he's been brought in for questioning, but the Chief has other ideas. 
 Hello. Hi. 
 I just sent Donna in there to basically bide time. 
 I'm the psychologist working at HQ. 
 Because the cyber guys need time to do their thing on his phone. 
 Richard has installed a back door on the phone, so he's actually live monitoring anything that now happens on that phone in terms of location, calls, text messages. 
 And Phil needs time to plant the listening device, search the car and put the tracker on. 
 Will he discover the tracker when he gets home? 
 He might do. But you know, I've had that before when I was at Scotland Yard. Once, a villain sent a tracker back to us in the post, saying, "I think you've lost this." 
 So better crooks then him have caught us out in the past. 
 Where did you drop them off? 
 Erm...I can't give you that location. 
 Are you going to provide them with any more help whilst they are on the run? 
 Walkie-talkies? 
 Phones? 
 Got about a month's worth of rations in there. Have you? 
 How? 
 Binos, camera, radios - f*cking yellow radios, look. 
 Olaf's done well. 
 How wide is their network? 
 Now, there's a good question. 
 In my wildest dreams, he's going to pick up his phone and he's going to ring somebody of some significance. 
 He's not going to pick that phone up and call the fugitives, but he may call someone who may call someone who may call the fugitives, and we may just possibly be on the back of that somehow. 
 Which will inch us ever closer to Jez and Kirk. 
 OK, ladies and gentlemen, as the end of day one approaches, let's just remind ourselves. 
 At 12.45pm, the fugitives went on the run in Birmingham. 
 We knew nothing about them. 
 Let's see where we are a few hours later. 
 Let's start with Lorna Jones. 
 Great first day. Great. I'm going to have a protein ball. 
 Then I want to get pissed. 
 I don't see how they're going to get me. 
 How are they going to get me? 
 They have no idea where I am! 
 Ayo Adasina and Madu Alecore. 
 We're assuming at the moment that they may have jumped onto a train. 
 There's only one thing wrong with that, Gabriel - assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups. 
 So not 100% sure this is actually how you're supposed to do it, but... 
 Ayo, let me just give you a tip about the pegs. 
 'We've been friends since we were 12-13 years old.' 
 So our relationship, I would say, is love-hate, hate-love. 
 It's more love than hate. 
 Have them at an angle. 
 Have them at an angle. Listen to me. 
 I know, I'm just helping... 
 Listen to me. 
 What I said to you was... 
 I'm just helping. 
 ..when you're on a plane and an oxygen mask drops down... 
 Yes? 
 What do they tell you? 
 Put your own oxygen mask on first... 
 OK. 
 ..then help the person next to you. OK. 
 Hamish Thoburn and Mikaela Sales. 
 We're monitoring their current bank accounts? 
 Yes. 
 That's excellent, thank you very much. No problem. 
 (Cheering) 
 Thank you so much, all you guys. 
 At university, Hamish and I, yeah, we had a fling. 
 'He's in Michael Douglas' spectrum - Red-hot-blooded male!' 
 Is there any chance of me rekindling a relationship with Mikaela while we're on the run? 
 It's not impossible. 
 I mean, I know she fancies me. 
 I'm certainly cuddling him. 
 To abstinence and liberty... for all. 
 Anna Theresa May and Elizabeth Francis Garnett. 
 They're adventurous, they're used to the outdoors. 
 It really wouldn't surprise me if they manage to be quite successful. 
 I hope you're wrong. 
 (Laughter) 
 Less of that talk, thank you very much, young man. 
 We'll get them. We'll get them. 
 That's more like it. 
 Day one. 
 We're safe. 
 Oh, yes. f*ck the system. 
 That's us. 
 That's us. That's very appropriate. 
 That is very appropriate. 
 It's like we planned it. 
 OK, great. Thank you everybody. 
 Crack on. 
 Deputy Ben Owens starts to profile the girls. 
 So Anna and Elizabeth. 
 Two Yorkshire girls. 
 Elizabeth is the youngest of four. 
 Everyone calls her Lizzy. 
 20 years old now, still lives at home. 
 Her parents are Tony and Janine. 
 Anna, born 1991. 
 She's one of three. 
 Studied criminology at university. 
 Might come in handy. 
 Loves animals. 
 They're both very into hiking and the outdoors. 
 Anna's done a three peaks challenge barefoot. 
 Which is quite impressive. 
 Anna and Elizabeth, they're fit individuals. 
 They do lots of physical activities. 
 I think it gives us a strong indication that it may be rural. 
 These girls aren't scared of going rural. 
 Where are we? 
 I don't know, but that's maybe a good thing. 
 I think we're being followed. 
 Do you think we are? 
 I don't know, I'm just worried. 
 Childhood friends Anna and Elizabeth are in Warwickshire. 
 They're keeping their movements as random as possible to stay off the hunters' radar. 
 This is a bit eerie. 
 Feel like it's from The Hills Have Eyes - there's no-one around. 
 I reckon we cross over there and see where... Yeah. 
 Cos there's like houses there, and the horse field there. Yeah. 
 It's quite stiff, I think we're going to have to... Climb. Yeah. 
 Will my bag fit through there? 
 It's not going to fit through. 
 Isn't it? 
 Oh! Is it fitting through? 
 Will you give me a hand? 
 Anna is a very, very kind, a very loyal friend. Aw! 
 'We'll do anything, try anything.' 
 Don't forget your bag. 
 'Lizzy's, like, such a free spirit, so funny. Got a few screws missing.' 
 She gives off this persona, but Lizzy is actually really intelligent and she's capable of everything. 
 Very down to earth. Very friendly. 
 Aw! 
 That's lovely. 
 Ow! 
 
 
 
 HQ dispatch ground hunters Paul and Michelle to Elizabeth's home to interview her parents. 
 If asked, family and friends have to meet the hunters and surrender their phones, computers and tablets. 
 But whether they tell the truth is entirely up to them. 
 When did you last see your daughter? 
 Erm, Saturday. 
 I just dread to think how they're going to cope, though, with the big rucksacks on their backs. It's all that equipment and everything. 
 Yeah. Carrying it all around and then thinking, "Where am I going to stay?" 
 Like, they're going to pitch the tent for the night... 
 Yeah. 
 ..that's not going to look conspicuous in a middle of a field somewhere. 
 That's a good clue, Jan(!) What? 
 These people are trying to catch Liz, and you're disclosing everything. 
 Am I? 
 Yeah. 
 Your role is to try and assist Elizabeth, not give a full inventory of what she's up to. 
 All right, then. But I don't know what she's up to - that's the point. 
 I keep forgetting who I am talking to. 
 E-mail addresses and phone numbers. 
 Obviously, we want to check your phone. 
 What, check it to see whether we've received anything? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I might just have to check those bits of paper as well. 
 I-It's just a list. 
 Can I check the lists? 
 Am I all right to check the lists? 
 Erm, yeah, sure. 
 (Camera shutter clicks) 
 (Camera shutter clicks) 
 Paul and Michelle went into Elizabeth Garnett's property, spoke to mum and dad. 
 There was a number of bits of paper. 
 Prominent bit out of that was truck stops it mentions. 
 So I think they're going to hitchhike after getting a lift, and then do some camping. Shall we look at truck stops, anything? 
 CCTV of any hitchhiking areas. 
 See where that next step's going to be? 
 We asking the lorries? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Hi, would you be able to give us a lift anywhere? 
 Could we get a lift with you? 
 No? 
 No worries, thank you. 
 No problem. 
 What about this car here? 
 We need to hurry up because there's CCTV everywhere. 
 Where? 
 Oh, God. 
 Think we've got a couple of tough cookies, but I think where their downfall may lay is mentally. 
 Morning, ladies. Busy morning? 
 Yeah, will be, flat out again today, yeah. 
 Good, I'm looking forward to it, right? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing that for? 
 Shaking the pain out, mate. 
 Do you get phantom pains then, Jez? 
 I get a dull ache. 
 I very rarely get what I would call a proper electrical shock. I get... maybe, what? 
 Twice a year... 
 Yeah, yeah. ..get a big bang. 
 So, ANPR hit on Kirk and Jeremy. 
 The VW Passat. 
 It is going towards Cambridge, it's crossing the A1 around here. 
 In HQ, there's new evidence suggesting that Jez and Kirk were dropped in the Cambridge area by their getaway driver, Olaf. 
 The ANPR hit took them into an area where there's a number of military bases. 
 Now, they can't access those, but they could reach into using network cells. 
 They are not serving military, are they? 
 No, they're not, but they can draw in associates and connections there. 
 Commander's seen you. 
 Right, Tonto, are you ready? 
 We're ready! 
 I think they might be pretty attached to the idea of being heroes, thinking of themselves as being a bit indestructible. 
 Let them get cocky, let them make the mistake, don't fall into their overconfident mind set. 
 We need to be rational, dispassionate and detached and then eliminate them from the proceedings and then move onto the next set. 
 Hold on tight, Jez. 
 This is definitely a 100% way of not being caught. 
 No ANPR, no CCTV. 
 Diddly squat cameras anywhere. 
 (They giggle) 
 Yee-ha! 
 As HQ's latest lead on the ex-servicemen puts them close to Kirk's home, they decide to send the ground hunters to pay a visit to his wife. 
 Just coming. 
 Hiya. Hi. Is it Carol? 
 Yes. 
 Hi, I'm Nic. This is Dani. 
 Hello. We're here about Kirk. 
 Is it all right to come in? 
 Yeah, of course. Thank you. 
 Hello, what's your name? 
 Tilly. How old are you, Tilly? 
 Four. No way! Yeah! 
 You look like you're about eight. 
 You're big for four.. 
 Tomorrow, Bertie's going to be one. 
 (Gasping) 
 Really? 
 Is he having a party? 
 You're going to eat all his cake? 
 We're going to share it. 
 You're going to share his cake? 
 Yeah. Ooh, nice. 
 So, when did Kirk leave, then? 
 Er... 
 Saturday. 
 Do you know where he went? 
 I don't know. 
 And what's he kind of said to you about contact? 
 As far as he's concerned he's not going to speak to you? 
 No. Not even for the baby's birthday? 
 No, no. 
 He missed her birth, and first birthday, and numerous other birthdays, so... 
 Things like that don't really bother him. 
 It doesn't bother him. 
 It bothers me. 
 And what colour was his backpack? 
 Er, oh, my God. Camouflage, yeah, I think it was camouflage. 
 It's black. 
 Was it black? 
 Yeah. Was it? 
 Well done, Tilly. 
 It was black, there you go. 
 (Camera clicks) 
 Is this his tablet? 
 That's his iPad. 
 Does he have any other devices? 
 There's his laptop. 
 We're going to take that. 
 Kirk's mobile, laptop and iPad are taken for the cyber team to analyse. 
 Do you think the mum was telling the truth? 
 No. 
 Kids are more likely to be honest then their parents. 
 Kirk's Bowett's son Bertie is a year old tomorrow, That may be something we seek to exploit, in some way shape or form. 
 Do we go particularly unpleasant and bring his mother in for an interview tomorrow? 
 Yeah. 
 It has been said that he is very family orientated. 
 He is very focused on his children. 
 So if we can get the technical angle and get all the e-mails, Skype, everything covered. 
 If he does make contact, we're not going to miss it. 
 Do you think Kirk will be happy phoning or do you think he'll try and stop by? 
 There is no way round it. That day matters. 
 Obviously, there is going to be some contact. 
 But surely the incentive for him not to contact is the fact that he could win £100,000? 
 But you're never again going to get your son's first birthday. 
 But there'll be many more birthdays and the son won't remember. 
 I'd agree with you, if it were his third or his fourth. 
 It's his first birthday. 
 It's his first birthday. 
 Not for the child, for the parent. 
 OK, very interesting. 
 Right, we might need to formulate a bit of a strategy around that. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, can we gather round? 
 OK, we're going to find out where we are at with Anna and Elizabeth. 
 HQ's attention now turns to the youngest fugitives. 
 They have worked out the pair are staying on the run by hitchhiking from truck stops. 
 When you stop off at service stations, start handing out some posters of Anna and Elizabeth. 
 And the reason for that is that we know this is their MO. 
 We know they are going to service stations, to pick up rides, so let's get their mug shots all over. Yeah, no problems. 
 You never know, it might be complete gold dust, at some point. 
 Hi, there. Can you give us a shout if you have seen these two? 
 Two girls, aged between 20 and 25. 
 Hi, there, can I give you this to look at, please? 
 One of them has got blonde hair. The other one has got mousy-brown hair. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. Are you going anywhere we could get a lift to? 
 Where are you going to? 
 Anywhere. 
 Anywhere where you're going. 
 We just got to get away quickly! 
 We're desperate! All right. 
 Thank you. Where are you going? 
 Cornwall. Oh, perfect! 
 That would be great. 
 Thank you. Oh, wow, nice car. 
 A Jaguar. 
 I feel better now that we're in a car. 
 'We know they're young. We know they're marathon runners' and fit, young and healthy. 
 But even so, leaping from vehicle to vehicle and location to location, I'm sure, will be tiring. And I'm sure, at some point, they are going to make a mistake, upon which we need to exploit. 
 In fact, you could argue they are already pursuing a very risky line of behaviour, in any event. 
 How many times have you picked up a car in a service centre, you know, at a service park? 
 Like you just picked up me over there? 
 Loads of times. 
 Right. So, you've got a pattern straight off, haven't you? 
 Yeah. So, next time you look for a lift, you're not going to be doing it at a service station. Yeah. 
 Cos it is leaving a trail. 
 I think we need to stop hitchhiking. 
 Yeah, just round country lanes, I reckon. 
 What, not on services? 
 Yeah. 
 Not on services any more, because they are going to recognise it, aren't they? 
 If I could speak to the fugitives tonight, if I could whisper in their little shell-like, you know what I would say to them? 
 Stop putting yourself through this, 'because the longer you're at liberty, the greater you think your chances of achieving that prize will become.' 
 Actually, it is completely the reverse. 
 The longer they stay at liberty, the greater our chances of catching them. 
 How do you know that you did not get into a nearly-new Jag at Fleet Services with an MI5 agent? 
 Erm... 
 (Laughter) 
 Erm, we don't! Are you an MI5 agent? 
 I'm not likely to say yes, am I? 
 So, you're not an MI5 agent? 
 No. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 It's fugitive Kirk Bowett's son's birthday. 
 So, today, I would like you to keep an eye essentially on Carol Bowett. 
 We're on our way now to her house, to go and put a tracking device on her vehicle. Get that tracker on. 
 Get behind her and see what she does today. Good luck. Cheers, boss. 
 Chris. I have kit. 
 This is all from Carol Bowett's. 
 The cyber team are also focusing on Kirk. Like Christmas. 
 Has this come in as well? 
 Yep. 
 It's Kirk's laptop. 
 It's been hibernated. 
 Still live. Right, let's hack into these and see what we can find. 
 Can't believe it's my son's first birthday. Yeah, I know. 
 Risky, though. Got to do it, though. 
 Got to see my little lad. 
 I reckon there is a 50-50 chance of getting caught, to be honest. 
 Before heading out of the area, Kirk has pre-planned a secret rendezvous with his wife and son. 
 We're here. The stately home is there, about 700 metres away. 
 We're going to move up a track, into the folly. 
 That is your overwatch position. 
 That is mine. Stalk position. 
 I'm then going to guinea suit up in the dead ground. 
 That is the ELV, the meet. 
 Can't see him. He is well cam'd out. 
 It's really good. 
 Can't see him at all. 
 We will be at her house in about ten minutes. OK. 
 Let me know when that's deployed. 
 If she's not being followed, I should be able to see Carol at 12 o'clock, in amongst the trees at the play park. 
 The tracking device we're going to put on Carol's car today, I think distraction is going to be the best method. 
 How about one of us knocks on the door, while the other one lays under the car and sticks on the tracking device? 
 Let's get it on. 
 There it is. Nah. 
 The car's gone. 
 f*ck! She's gone already. 
 f*ck's sake. f*ck! 
 Hello, girls. All right, boss, hi. 
 Just to let you know that we've just arrived at the address and the vehicle has gone. 
 I haven't got a crystal ball. 
 I am an investigator, not a mind-reader. 
 Kirk and Carol. Kirk and Carol. 
 Having missed the opportunity to put a tracker on Carol's car, HQ are now resting their hopes on the cyber team hacking into Kirk's laptop. 
 CarolAmy1. CarolAmy1. 
 Oh! 
 Jez, I have eyes on Carol. 
 Eyes on Carol. Excellent news. 
 Go careful, mate. 
 TillyBeau1. B-E-A-U-1. 
 No. 
 There should be some sort of password hint on here. 
 I'm going to make a bound, to make the meeting, OK? 
 Roger. I can see you now. 
 Guys, it says "home space town space 1". 
 Where is he from? 
 Try Altringham1. Altringham1. 
 A-ha-ha-ha! 
 We are in, my friends! 
 Well done, Chris. Nice one. 
 Hello! Have you being followed? 
 We've got Vodaphone, iCloud, LinkedIn, Next account, Dropbox, Facebook. 
 His banking password. 
 G-mail password... 
 He's f*cked. It's got everything. 
 Happy birthday, you. 
 Happy birthday, young man. 
 So, now we own Kirk Bowett's online life. 
 Perfect. 
 He is completely screwed. 
 In celebration of the arrival of her third son with husband Wayne, Colleen Rooney has had a cast of her baby bump made, engraved with his name, birth weight and date. 
 I want one of them. Can't decide whether I like this or not? 
 Bit late now, innit, mate? 
 (He chuckles) 
 That's wild! 
 This time last week we were in a hot car, not knowing whether we would get caught or not, and now it feels like we've made a massive break from our pursuers. 
 They say you can't polish a turd, but... 
 They might get to the point where they think, "Why waste their time on us when they can go and catch the easy pickings and leave us to it?" 
 Chief, are you free for a sec? 
 Yes. So, this is Kirk's iPad. 
 Unknown to Kirk, the cyber team have hacked into his laptop and iPad, giving them access to his online accounts. 
 He has got a lot of stuff about their plans... 
 Show me the bits about Ryan. 
 Olaf is good to go for a little pick up in safe house. 
 Spot on. Yep, Olaf Jones, the getaway driver, yeah. 
 Funny enough, this conversation does not exist on his iPhone. 
 So he's deleted it off his iPhone thinking it's going to delete off here. 
 Ben? 
 You might want to come and see this. 
 That's a note to himself! Yeah. 
 The cyber team have also hacked into one of Jez's e-mail accounts. 
 So, we're in Jez Scarratt's Sky e-mail account. 
 We managed to get into that by resetting his password. 
 In his e-mail, there's an e-mail to himself. 
 He e-mailed it from his Gmail to his Sky. 
 It has a long list of contact details of various, places and we've got just a list of...phone numbers. 
 OK, Kirk Bowett and Jeremy Scarratt. 
 The cyber guys got into the lengthy conversation dating back prior to when they became fugitives, where they are talking and plotting and planning their time on the run. 
 Particularly, they refer to a guy called Dave Leo, and we've discovered David Leo lives in Blackpool. 
 So, Blackpool is the focus. 
 Any contacts that these two have in Blackpool we need to research and thoroughly exploit. 
 I've got a mate down in Blackpool, Dave Leo, that has access to a motor home and he'll probably have some contacts. 
 Kirk and Jez are with the wife of a veteran friend, Karen Cameron. 
 Blackpool is full of CCTV. No doubt there's lots of ANPR cameras, but at the end of the day we're arriving in a third party vehicle, as we've always done. 
 So, we should arrive, basically, completely unannounced. 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 OK, guys, I would like you to make your way covertly to Blackpool. 
 We've got stuff coming in as I'm talking to you that we're just plotting. 
 Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
 All of Dave Leo's vehicles are on monitoring, all of his phones are on monitoring. 
 His motor home as well. 
 Everything's on monitoring. 
 Truth is, we're all over Dave Leo. 
 Borrow your phone? 
 That would be great, and I'll give my mate a call. OK. 
 Dave, is that you? 
 Who's that? 
 Jez Scarratt. Hiya, Jez. 
 You all right? 
 I'm very well, very well. 
 Are you at work or are you at home? 
 OK, that's not a problem. 
 We'll try and find where you live, and we will hang around there till you finish doing your work. 
 Is that OK? 
 That's fine. 
 Brilliant. Thanks very much indeed and I'll see you later. 
 See you soon, boss. Yeah. 
 The telephone that made that incoming call to Dave Leo is shown on Facebook as belonging to Karen, with a 'K', Cameron. 
 The next step is that we need bottom out exactly where her current location is and get cell site analysis done on that number so that we can track her and see if she is a driver, and then if she is a driver, where is she taking them to next? 
 Karen's phone is about to give away Jez and Kirk's every move. 
 There's always that worry that the hunters are going to be over our shoulders. 
 (Tram bell rings) 
 I'm not scared of them. 
 I've faced people who want to kill me, and they don't want to kill me. 
 So, we're just going to have to outwit them and keep our distance by staying off grid, you know, staying off grid. 
 So, we've got cell site information, which is Karen Cameron's phone. 
 Identified near Blackpool Pleasure Gardens. 
 Obviously, we need to get Michelle and Paul over there as a matter of urgency. Yes. 
 (On phone) : ETA in Blackpool? 
 We're arriving there at quarter past 12. 
 Quarter past 12? 
 Right, OK. 
 The phone of Karen Cameron, we are getting cell site monitoring of it and it's in Blackpool. 
 OK. She may be potentially ferrying the fugitives around. 
 The fugitives need to kill time before meeting Dave Leo, so decide to have lunch with Karen and a friend. 
 The more moves that we're doing, and the more bounds that we're making of different motor transports, the more confident we are getting. 
 But the hunters continue to track Karen's phone. 
 Following the cell site locations for Karen Cameron, and we've noticed that she's stayed in one place for quite a long time, which looks to be next to a car park, and so we're just going to request CCTV to try and see if we can spot our fugitives. 
 They'll be looking for two guys on their own. 
 And we're clearly together, us four. 
 So, Chief, I think we've got confirmed a sighting of Jez Scarratt in the shopping arcade. 
 Hounds Hill Shopping Centre. 
 There's one there. Yeah. Yeah. 
 They've got a very distinctive walk. Yeah. 
 We need to move Paul and Michelle down to the pedestrianised precinct. 
 OK, so that's Church Street. 
 We're coming into Church Street now. 
 (On phone) : Just confirming they are in a group of four, group of four. 
 One of them has a distinctive red waist length coat on. 
 It's a bit empty in here, isn't it? 
 It's just opened at 12. Oh, right. 
 So, will there be other people coming in here, will they? 
 I assume so. 
 Right. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 (On phone) : Michelle? 
 Yeah? 
 Go on, boss. 
 Have you got an update for me? 
 Not as yet, no. Not as yet, no. 
 This phone has been static for some time, which may indicate that they are static. 
 Perhaps they're eating? 
 OK? 
 Yep. 
 Think about pubs, eateries... 
 It's lunchtime. 
 We've got triangulation that might be tracing a more accurate location. 
 So, Cookson Street. 
 Mr Basrai. 
 Mr Basrai... It's going to head to a Mr Basrai's dinery. 
 Mr Basrai's. 
 Exact location? 
 OK, it's on the corner of Deansgate, it's opposite the council. 
 Right, standby. You hearing me? 
 Mr Basrai's Curry House, which is on Deansgate at the junction with Cookson Street. 
 Deansgate, Cookson Street, have you got that? 
 Basrai's Curry House. 
 They may not be in that restaurant, but that is the only alternative place they can eat. 
 OK, we're going to head that way now, boss. 
 We're at the wrong end of Deansgate, aren't we? 
 Right, just hold on. 
 About 300 metres away? 
 I do really want these guys. 
 We will get them. Absolutely. 
 We will. 
 Num, num, num. Round two. 
 We're now going for India. 
 And then I might end up in Asia next. 
 (He chuckles) 
 Bloody lovely, isn't it? 
 Great place. 
 A bit of ice cream for pudding? 
 We've got it. 
 You got that side. 
 I'll go this side. 
 Book a table for tonight. 
 Go in, make a booking and then come out. 
 Thank you. Thanks a lot. 
 There's some hunters over there. 
 They're hunters. Is it? 
 Yeah. 
 They're in here now. 
 They look like they're from the city. 
 They're not from this area, and they look like they are looking for somebody. 
 So... 
 Don't look around. 
 Just keep looking forward. 
 We've been hunted. 
 Stay still. No, no, don't look. 
 Just stay calm. Stay calm. 
 Boss, can you hear me? 
 Yes, go ahead. 
 We've got eyes on. OK. 
 Keep them under surveillance and then follow them out. 
 Feel sick now. 
 What shall we do, Jez? 
 Can you call the manager over? 
 Hi, there. Erm, are there people out the front asking enquiries? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you have an alternative exit out of the building? 
 A back entrance? 
 Yeah. 
 You go. I'm staying here. 
 You two go. 
 They have just... Somebody has just gone out the back. 
 They've just gone out the back. 
 Right, get after them. 
 Follow them! 
 Right, the other one is getting up and moving. 
 The other one is getting up and moving. 
 Have you just let somebody through there? 
 No. 
 Well, where is this? 
 Where does this go? 
 Where does this go? 
 Staffroom. 
 Well, where is the person with yellow hair just gone through there? 
 Is that your concern? 
 Yes, it is my concern. Where have they gone? 
 Where have they done? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 Boss, they're letting them out. 
 They're helping them. 
 Well, get after them! 
 There is no way out there, is there? 
 Bugger. 
 (sh1t!) 
 We've got a vehicle leaving the service yard. 
 We're running parallel with them now. 
 Suggest you f*ck off! 
 We all know from experience that these investigations can turn just like that. 
 We're going public. 
 You may qualify for a cash reward. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm scared! 
 I'm terrified. 
 (Tyres squeal) 
 Freeze! Don't jump in the canal! 
 We're in this for the long haul. 
 It's us against them.
