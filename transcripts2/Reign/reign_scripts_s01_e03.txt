 Nostradamus: Since Mary, Queen of Scotland, was a child, the English wanted her country and her crown. 
 She is sent to France to wed its next King to save herself and her people, a bond that should protect her. 
 But there are forces that conspire, forces of darkness, forces of the heart. 
 Long may She Reign. 
 Previously on Reign... I don't know if I'm ready. To leave here? Or marry the future King of France? You will wed young Francis for your faith, for your people, for Scotland. Henry: She's here doing her job, and her job is waiting for me to decide when you should marry her. What matters is what's right for my country. You don't want to marry me. (Rooster crows) (Chickens clucking) We've no quarrel with the English. We're just farmers. But... You're welcome to share our breakfast. You're going to need a lot of eggs. (Horses approaching) A few grains should help you sleep. But only a few and not every night. Mmm. (Man screams) What? Nostradamus. What are you seeing? War. And the cost of war. Where? I don't know. But wherever it is, it will reach inside this castle. (Laughter) All right, Kenna. It's your turn. Not your first but your best kisser. It was a man, not a boy. Who? You must tell us. All I'll say is that there's no point in waiting for boys our own age who have no idea what they're doing. Either find yourself a man or... Take care of your needs yourself. (Others chuckle) Anyway, I think that it's Greer's turn, isn't it? My first kiss... ...is in the very near future. I'm not like you. My family's not titled. I can't afford even little mistakes. But... I think I've found the man. He's tall, dark and noble. Tomas, the son of the King of Portugal. He's here negotiating some kind of trade deal, but he's taking his time about it, and I think it's to stay with me. Greer, it's dangerous to get involved with a prince. You know they marry for alliances. Your family are commoners. Tomas is a King's b*st*rd, like Bash. Favored, too, but with money and land. I'm not a fool. I know a true royal would never look at me except to ruin me. I can take care of myself. (Horse neighs in distance) Your Majesty, Your Uncle, Claude de Guise, is here and wishes to see you at once. You look well, Mary. Your mother sends her affection. Read it later. You may be assured the love is in there, as is the news of a crisis in Scotland. The English. They're massing on the border. And these are not the normal skirmishes. They're out in number. They're looking for weakness, and if they find any... We must respond with strength. Yes. Surely my mother has sent soldiers. Of course. But not enough. We need more men. Our strongest ally is France. King Henry will help us. He's been asked, and he's been slow to answer. You were sent here to secure the alliance by marrying Henry's son. Now they're dragging their feet. What happened? Nothing happened. They're being politicians. Francis and his father aren't eager to commit to Scotland. They'd rather keep me in a drawer, like a pair of gloves for cold weather. And then when the weather grows cold for France, they'll take me out and I'll be wed. They're afraid of what a permanent bond might mean. But right now, we have immediate problems. Scotland needs more troops. As Queen, you must do something. Henry: Mary. (Clears throat) Your Grace. (Door shuts) We've been... discussing this business in Scotland. You have my sympathy. Father, I believe Her Majesty is here for more than just sympathy. Of course. We're sending wagons, gunpowder, supplies for your army... Supplies are useless without men. Surely you can spare a few. You have so many more soldiers than we do. And... Many more borders as well. You only have to worry about England. I have England, Spain, a hundred Italian and German principalities... You are supposed to be our ally. If our positions were reversed, Scotland would help. (Sighs) Mary, I'm sorry. Eight companies. Six! I hope I will have the happiness of seeing you tonight at the entertainments. Yes? I hope you understand the position you're putting us in. (Clears throat) Lives will be lost. She only asked for six companies. And what if we lose those companies? We look weak in England's eyes. So we send more and we lose those. When do we stop? Before or after England decides we're soft prey? At the moment, the Scottish border is quicksand. You know this. A pretty girl doesn't change that fact, even if she happens to be your fiancée. And their Queen. Mary. Mary, my father just... The political situation is complicated. Complicated? People will be dying soon. Isn't that complicated enough? Mary, I agree with you. You do? I think France should help Scotland in this. We're at a tilting point: If England invades Scotland and succeeds, it'll be that much of a stronger enemy to France. Then we're on the same side. For all the good it does. One day, if things goes well, we'll rule France and Scotland and we'll be together. Now we have no real power. We have to wait. No. I'm tired of waiting. And if we have no power, then we must find a way of getting some. Come play with me? Happily. Sometimes you just need to kick something. You're not like a girl. What did you think girls were like? They sit around, afraid they're gonna mess up their dresses. (Chuckles) You like to have fun. (Grunts) (Birds chirping) Oh. ♪ Roots are not something you lay ♪ 
♪ but something you take on your way ♪ 
♪ and I know more... Mary: It's stuck. Maybe you should fetch someone with a ladder. Wait, I've got it! Your Majesty, may I present Tomas of Portugal, lord of palmela? Tomas, Mary, Queen of Scots. Hello. Do you often stroll in trees, Your Majesty? Um, I climbed up here to fetch prince Charles' ball, but I guess he got tired of waiting. Are you sure? Because from down here, it looks like Scotland attacked Portugal without provocation. (Chuckles) Um, turn around so I can come down. We may have a diplomatic incident here, Your Majesty. Greer, please get your friend to turn around. I can't climb down with him staring up my skirts. (Screams) (Grunts) Oh... Your arm! I'll be fine. Are you all right? Yes. I'm so sorry. (Sighs) Just promise, no more attacks from the sky. (Chuckles) Portugal surrenders. Greer of Kinross, I look forward to seeing you tonight. Your Majesty. I might not have made a very good first impression, but I see why you like him. Isn't he perfect? I have it all planned. The boating party's coming up. I'll pack a picnic basket, we'll be out there on the lake under the moonlight. And nature will take its course. Your first kiss. And a beginning, I hope. Well, good luck. He definitely looks worth the wait. ♪

eh-eh-o eh-o Your mind's elsewhere. Is it slender lady Charlotte or plump lady Isabelle with the breasts like two pigeons, huh? If I told you, you might poach. You've a liking for pigeon, as I recall. (Chuckles) We should help Scotland. Not for Mary but for France. By all means, explain. When you say that the border is quicksand, you assume that we'll lose. England hasn't sent its entire army north. They're poking to see what reaction they get. We could strike fast, hit back hard and win. But if we do nothing, we risk losing the entire Scottish alliance. Years of planning, wasted. So it's a balance of risks either way. Very good. Except I've decided the... Reasons against outweigh the reasons for. And guess what: I'm King. Another round? You never spar with me. Is it a good idea for a King to spar with his usurper? You mean his inheritor. (Laughs) If you win, I shut up about this whole subject. If I win, you send those six companies of men. (Yells) (Grunting) (Panting): Very good. Very good. When can they leave? Oh. No one's going to Scotland. But your word, your wager. Well, that's what Kings do. We make promises to everybody, and whatever works for the realm, we keep. Otherwise, they never happened. Lesson for today. That's not the way... Don't need any more lessons right now. Bread...the seeded kind. I'm not talking about everyday black bread. Chestnut spread. Strawberry tartlets. Strawberries this late? Uh, I can make you apple tarts. Everyone has apple. I wanted something different. Talk to God. He put the strawberries away. Fine. But I want the apple tarts that have the honey on top. Baked, so they're golden brown, not soggy, to taste fresh and crisp after two hours in a boat on the lake. You want an awful lot... this must be for someone special. Not that it's any of your business, but yes, it's for someone very special. I expect your best. Why don't you just leave the list. But who would read it to you? Mary: Greer? I've been looking for you everywhere. You said Tomas was in from Portugal to negotiate a trade deal. What kind of deal? I don't know. Something about buying French timber for ships. Ah, that makes sense. They're expanding their fleet...war ships, exploring vessels for the new world. Of course they need timber. (Laughs): Why are we talking about wood? Because it occurred to me that if a Queen can't command what she needs, maybe she can buy it. Tomas: May I know where you're taking me, Your Majesty? Mary: I didn't want to be overheard. Mm, intriguing. Is it romantic? Conspiratorial? May I have a hint? It's about timber. Timber? Timber. Scotland has trees, too, you know. Whatever deal you have with King Henry, 
 I'll do better...if you close the deal now  and if you send us men instead of money. Your country is in need. But surely, King Henry will help you. I mean, the alliance. I see. Well, my father The King empowered me to make whatever deal I think best. And I'd be a fool to turn this down. But... Henry considers our deal almost made. And it's not a small thing to anger a King in his own house. Meet me this afternoon. I'll confirm our transaction then. ♪ 
♪ A heart unsatisfied ♪ walks on a wire ♪ from the lover ♪ to the loved... Come to my bedchamber. Now. The guards are discreet. I want to be with you completely, as a woman, but... ...as a girl, I need more time. How long? (Exhales) ♪ When you're ready. ♪ A simple desire Of course. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh... ♪ You crossed this line ♪ do you find it hard to sit with me tonight? ♪

It's an old church, made by Louis VII. Meant to last forever, but... nothing does. (Birds chirping) Why have you brought me here? I wanted your advice. I sent for this from my ship in the bay. The new world has brought us wealth... Beyond imagining. Do you think these might make a woman think kindly of me? I think you might have a chance, yeah. I'm glad you think so. I don't understand. I thought you and-and Greer were... What does Greer have to do with this? She's a lovely girl, but... I've seen you... And I can't look away. There is... there's a wildness in you, as you play... Ride, as you climb trees. I see your spirit... And I believe it's like mine. Just thoughts I would have kept to myself, but I see your struggle here in France. Left to solve your problems alone. I'd never do that. Never. Wed me. Wed me, and I won't make you wait. Say yes, and you'll have your men. Say yes. (Birds chirping) Tomas... y-you're kind, you're handsome, 
(laughs): You're very charming... I sense a refusal. But I am a Queen. And flattered as I am by your attentions, I must marry a nation, not a man. What is this? My father's been writing to the pope, arranging to have me declared legitimate. My father is dying, and I'm his only living son. His grandson is next in line, and he's only three years old. My father doesn't trust the regent to safe guard Portugal. He wants me on the throne. The announcement will be made any day now. So, you see... I can lay my heart at your feet, and my country as well. We can save Scotland. If you marry me. Will you? A real proposal from The Future King? What does your uncle think? I haven't told him yet. Because you're worried he'd press you to accept Tomas, and you're not ready to let Francis go? It's all right to admit it, Mary. I'd be exchanging a man I... Admire... For a man I barely know. And true support for Scotland. Tomas seems nice. Feelings may come in time. And what of Greer's feelings? She had her eye on Tomas. A crown prince would never marry her... she's not even a possibility. Well, it's entirely possible that nothing will come of it, and that Tomas will return home to Portugal. I asked him to be discreet while I considered the proposal. ♪ (Woman laughing) ♪ Your vision. Do you know yet how the warfare you saw will reach inside the castle? Nostradamus: No. Catherine: Maybe you saw the fighting in Scotland. If Mary weds my son and it causes his death, as you predicted, this castle will see violence within its walls like none before. Tell me exactly what you saw. ♪ You look lovely. Is the King still refusing to send the men we need? I've pushed as hard as I can. Well, I know you've done your best. Thank you. Mary... ♪ Nostradamus. (Music stops) Why don't you share your wisdom with all of us. I don't understand. Always at my wife's ear. What do you whisper? I hear Emperor Maximilian has a seer in Prague who can... Tell fortunes using playing cards. Tell the fortunes of Queen Mary and her ladies. Forgive me, Your Majesty, but I'm not skilled at cards and I don't control my visions. They come and go as they will. You're not as good as Maximilian's seer? Leave him alone, Henry. Oh, come, the man must have something to recommend him since you rely so deeply on his counsel. Hmm? 
 
 Each of you pick a card. Have your question ready. Will I ever love again? You'll meet a dark, handsome stranger. Be wary of flattery. Life will offer many challenges. You'll meet them with grace. Henry: Well, that's not very specific. Give us a fortune, not a platitude. Or is that the best you can do? The lion will fight the dragon on the field of poppies. What? The lion will fight the dragon on the field of poppies. Who will I...? You'll fall in love with a man with a white mark on his face. When will I see my family? You'll never go home. What do you mean "Never go home"? Nostradamus: That's all I was given. You know no more than I. Well, there's a showman for you. Musicians, dancing music. Enough of this foolishness. Why would you say that to my friend? Why scare her? I can only say what I've seen. Like a dragon and a field of poppies? Are people fooled by you? The only dragons are in children's stories. Then I must be a liar. But why these lies? Who gains? The fortune-telling was Henry's idea, so it can't have come from Catherine. Who are you and who do you serve? The realm... Myself, the truth. The truth? Serving the truth at court is a crooked path. You know, I don't think I ever noticed that tiny white scar on your cheek. It becomes you. Thank you. Would you excuse me? Mary, believe me, I've argued with my father. I've explained why politically it's a good idea. I've, I've done more than argue. I've done all I can reasonably do. Then maybe you should be unreasonable. I commanded the musicians to play music from my country. Allow me. (Grunts) (Portuguese music playing) (Guests murmuring) ♪ Why don't you dance like that? Shut up. Apparently they do things differently in Portugal. I love this Portuguese music. Keep playing. Not what I meant by "Discreet." Greer, don't be upset. It was just a dance. I'm not upset because of a dance. (Sniffles) I'm not upset at all. I'm just going back to my room. I'm not feeling well. Please, let's talk. There's no need. You're my Queen. You're rich and you're beautiful and you're engaged to the crown prince of France. I thought perhaps you could leave Tomas for me. It's not as if you could marry him anyway. You knew how important this was to me. It just wasn't important to you. No, Greer... You do have a way of leaving chaos in your wake. What was that about? Tomas asked me to marry him. He's being declared legitimate. He says his father wants him on the throne imminently. It's not what I want, but my options are extremely limited. You went behind our back? You're making a new alliance with Portugal? It was his idea, not mine, and he's willing to actually get married, too, which is more than your family is offering. You can't just break an alliance. I don't want to. You said that we had no power, that there was nothing we could do. I don't like it but I found a way. If France won't help us, then I will have no choice but to accept Portugal's offer. His name is Tomas. You'd be marrying the man, not the country. It's what my mother will want... ...and what my country needs. ("By your side" by Alex and Sam playing) ♪ Somewhere in my memories ♪ are the times that you and me ♪

♪ if they tried... (Fireworks whistling) (Guests cheering) Your father is a confusing man. Yes, he is. Mary: It's not a reflection on you personally, but my family will need to confirm all that you've said. I understand you're not ready to trust me. You needn't wait for confirmation from Portugal. My ship in the bay has several companies of men. They can leave for Scotland on tomorrow's tide. So quickly? I know you're the woman I want and I'll do whatever it takes to keep from losing you. What are you doing here? Returning the basket. So, how did it go, lady only the special cheese for me? Your important friend like it? (Sobbing) Is he a punishing man if he doesn't get the exact thing he wants the moment he wants it? Hard to imagine a more uncomfortable conversation about one's father. You don't even know what I'm talking about specifically. I know exactly what you're talking about. His attention drifted to you and now it's drifting elsewhere. Am I right? He's not punishing you, he's playing you. He likes to play and he likes to win, but know this about him: A victory without effort is worse than a defeat. (Chuckles) (Clears throat) If the Scottish alliance is worth saving, we need to send troops. We've had this talk before. Not quite. I see the way that you look at the Lady Kenna and the way that she looks at you. I know your pattern. Now, I'm not sure that you've slept with her yet. What's this? But I wonder how your Medici wife and, more important to you, your French mistress will react when they find out that you moved in on a new girl. I think we both know that Diane and my mother have a way of making life very difficult when they wish, even for a King. Finally. Very well, King in waiting. I'm not... We'll try it your way. Win or lose, you will answer for it. That's what Kings do. There are six companies of men quartered between us and the channel. You'll send our fastest rider to mobilize them. Do you know who our fastest rider is? Send a message to all six captains. Tell them that they'll board ship at Outreau. Are you sure you're all right to ride? I am a riding fiend, little brother. You'll be happy, Scotland will be happy, Mary will be happy, and Mary will stay. Just be careful. Aren't I always? Well, if always means never. (Horse sputters) (Horse neighs) Hyah! So this goat just goes running off. As for my father, he's shouting, "Catch him! Catch him!" (Laughs) I chased that damned goat over half the mountaintop. And I decided, no more sheep and goats. Indoor work for me. Mind you, when I go home, that goat still shares our house in the winter. (Laughs) There's no escape. (Laughs) I can't say I've ever lived with a goat. Mm, didn't think so, where you come from. But my father keeps hounds. They're all over the house, all the time. I think he cares more about the hounds than my mother and my sisters. Is that why he sent you so far away, with Queen Mary? Oh, he sent me here to be married. I have to marry well, for my family's sake. My parents made that very clear to me. The only way to rise in the world is through land and title, and for people like us, the only way to achieve these things is to marry them. So, love has no place in your life? I hope it will, but I have four younger sisters counting on me, as well. If I rise, they rise. You should have been there when they saw me off to France. They looked at me the way my father looks at an investment, wondering if I'll fail, or pay off. Well, I'm sorry you have to live this way. ♪ And it's gonna be my beautiful day. ♪ Mm. (Sighs) I never... I shouldn't... Nor should you. You're a servant. Nothing can ever happen between us. (Sighs) But it did. Mary, it's done. Six companies are on their way to Scotland tonight. What? Oh, Francis! But how? You said the King wouldn't change his mind, that you'd done all you could. I suppose I was inspired. I can't believe it. I still can't offer to marry you right away, like Tomas. You'd have a secure alliance there. Here, we can only hope. Some day it will be right for our countries. I would rather have hope with you than certainty anywhere else. Morning. What's this? You've been avoiding me, so I thought I would try and bribe you with this new venetian drink. It's coffee. I'm sorry. The truth is, there never really was much between Tomas and me. Some flirting... all very proper... but that's it. I wanted to believe there was more. Well, you know why. Oh, I imagined the whole fairytale. The perfect first kiss with the man with the white mark on his face. Me as the heroine, helping my family. I know you'll find the right man, Greer. I know you will. Should I tell you a secret? Maybe it's because I've been engaged since I was six, but I've never been kissed, either. (Laughs) Well, actually, things have changed for me in that respect. What?! No! Who is it? Tell me everything! (Laughs) Morning. I suppose I should send down for breakfast then. No. By all means, I'll go. (Laughter) Coffee? And we want the sweet butter, not the other kind. And try putting some heavy cream in that coffee, but for heaven's sake, not goat's milk cream. I'll take care of it. Lovely morning, my Lady. Our men will have gone north to the channel. Calais is in English hands, so our men will take ship at Outreau. Man: Guards? (Horse neighing) Quickly! (Neighing) It's Bash. Mary: The cost of war will reach inside this castle. How is he? He's gravely injured. I can tend to his wounds, ease the pain, but I make no guarantees. Bash: Father, the English... Rode out from Calais to face us. We never made it to the ships. It was a slaughter. Nostradamus: He shouldn't be talking. I'm give him a potion, put him to sleep. Clear the room. It's the best thing for him. Francis: Bash? Bash, I'm so sorry. Henry: Come. (Gasps) Come. Go wait. Kings don't apologize. I didn't know this would happen, but I knew it was a risk. So did you. Lives are always at risk, at our hand, at our will. For a prince, this was a... A cheap lesson. Cheap? Six companies. Your son... I know you love him. You were influenced by your heart. If that happens when you are King, you could lose 10,000 men. You could lose France. The English were ready for us. Someone told them. Yes. While Bash was riding to six different companies, it appears someone loyal to the English rode straight to Calais and warned them. Well, aren't you going to tell Francis? No. Not today. It would ruin the lesson. Let something come of this treachery. Francis will never trust his heart again. That's the only way to rule. Francis? Francis? (Panting) You did the right thing. (Crow caws) Talk to me. You should marry Tomas. My father's right. I haven't been thinking clearly. That's not true. You were trying to help. I can't help you. France can't help. There are no more troops to send. Do what's right for your country. Francis! Can you say that I'm wrong? (Crow cawing) (Sighs) (Knocking) Well... I suppose you're going to have to teach me Portuguese. I'll make you happy. You already have. There are eight companies of fighting men on that ship. They'll be in Scotland in two days. The English lion will fight the dragon on the field of poppies.
