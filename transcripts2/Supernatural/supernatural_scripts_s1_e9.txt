 Air Date: 15 November 2005 
 [FADE IN: LAWRENCE, KANSAS. NIGHT. A young woman, JENNY, is sitting on the floor of her home, unpacking boxes. She comes across a photo of herself and her husband at their wedding. She begins to cry just as her daughter, SARI, comes in the room.] 
 SARI: Mommy? [JENNY looks up.] 
 JENNY: Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you in bed? 
 SARI: There's something in my closet. 
 [CUT TO: SARI's BEDROOM. JENNY opens the closet doors and looks inside as SARI watches from her bed.] 
 JENNY: See? There's nothing there. 
 SARI: You sure? 
 JENNY: I'm sure. Now, come on. Get into bed. [SARI crawls into bed and JENNY tucks her in.] 
 SARI: I don't like this house. 
 JENNY: You're just not used to it yet. But you and your brother and me –- we are going to be very happy here. I promise. [She kisses SARI on her forehead.]I love you. [She turns off the light and gets up to leave the room.] 
 SARI: The chair. 
 JENNY: Okay. [She moves a chair under the doorknob of the closet.]The chair. Just to be safe. [SARI lies down and goes to bed. JENNY leaves.] 
 [After returning to the living room, JENNY continues unpacking boxes. She stops when she hears the sound of scratching coming from the basement.] 
 JENNY: Please, God, don't let it be rats. 
 [A few moments later, JENNY goes downstairs into the basement with a flashlight. She tries turning on a light, but the switches don't work.] 
 JENNY: Terrific. 
 [The scene returns to SARI's bedroom. The chair begins moving on its own, away from the closet doors. SARI sits up in her bed, wide-eyed and afraid. Back in the basement, JENNY keeps looking around. On the floor, she sees a large black trunk. She kneels down and opens it, pulling out old photos of the Winchester family. Written on the back of a picture are the words, "The Winchesters. John, Mary, Dean, and Little Sammy." JENNY smiles. In SARI's bedroom, the closet doors open by themselves. Standing in the closet is what looks like a person, but it is entirely made out of fire. SARI screams, and the screen goes black.] 
 [FADE IN: MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT. While Sam is sleeping, he begins dreaming of JENNY. She is inside her bedroom, screaming for help. Sam wakes up, confused.] 
 [The next morning, while Dean is on the computer, Sam is drawing a picture of a tree.] 
 Dean: All right. I've been cruisin' some websites. I think I found a few candidates for our next gig. A fishing trawler found off the coast of Cali –- its crew vanished. And, uh, we got some cattle mutilations in West Texas. Hey. [Sam looks up from his drawing.]Am I boring you with this hunting evil stuff? 
 Sam: No. I'm listening. Keep going. 
 Dean: And, here, a Sacramento man shot himself in the head. Three times. [He waves his hand in front of Sam's face.]Any of these things blowin' up your skirt, pal? 
 Sam: [looking at his picture]Wait. I've seen this. 
 Dean: Seen what? [Sam gets up from the bed and goes searching through his duffel bag.]What are you doing? [Sam finds a photo of their family from when he was a baby. He compares the tree in the photo to his drawing. They are the Same.] 
 Sam: Dean, I know where we have to go next. 
 Dean: Where? 
 Sam: Back home –- back to Kansas. 
 Dean: Okay, random. Where'd that come from? 
 Sam: [showing the photo to Dean]All right, um, this photo was taken in front of our old house, right? The house where Mom died? 
 Dean: Yeah. 
 Sam: And it didn't burn down, right? I mean, not completely, they rebuilt it, right? 
 Dean: I guess so, yeah. What the hell are you talkin' about? 
 Sam: Okay, look, this is gonna sound crazy but….the people who live in our old house –- I think they might be in danger. 
 Dean: Why would you think that? 
 Sam: Uh…it's just, um….look, just trust me on this, okay? [He starts to walk away, and Dean follows him.] 
 Dean: Wait, whoa, whoa, trust you? 
 Sam: Yeah. 
 Dean: Come on, man, that's weak. You gotta give me a little bit more than that. 
 Sam: I can't really explain it is all. 
 Dean: Well, tough. I'm not goin' anywhere until you do. [Sam sighs. Dean waits expectantly.] 
 Sam: I have these nightmares. 
 Dean: [nodding]I've noticed. 
 Sam: And sometimes….they come true. 
 Dean: [stunned]Come again? 
 Sam: Look, Dean….I dreamt about Jessica's death –- for days before it happened. 
 Dean: Sam, people have weird dreams, man. I'm sure it's just a coincidence. [He sits down on the bed.] 
 Sam: No, I dreamt about the blood dripping, her on the ceiling, the fire, everything, and I didn't do anything about it ‘cause I didn't believe it. And now I'm dreaming about that tree, about our house, and about some woman inside screaming for help. I mean, that's where it all started, man, this has to mean something, right? 
 Dean: [overwhelmed]I don't know. 
 Sam: [sitting down across from Dean]What do you mean you don't know, Dean? This woman might be in danger. I mean, this might even be the thing that killed Mom and Jessica! 
 Dean: All right, just slow down, would ya? [He stands up and begins pacing.]I mean, first you tell me that you've got the Shining? And then you tell me that I've gotta go back home? Especially when…. 
 Sam: When what? 
 Dean: [sadly]When I swore to myself that I would never go back there? 
 Sam: [softly]Look, Dean, we have to check this out. Just to make sure. 
 Dean: I know we do. 
 [CUT TO: EXT – Winchester HOUSE. Dean and Sam pull up outside the house.] 
 Sam: You gonna be all right, man? 
 Dean: Let me get back to you on that. [They get out of the car. After knocking on the front door, JENNY answers it. Sam is shocked that she is the Same woman from his dream.] 
 JENNY: Yes? 
 Dean: Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but we're with the Federal— 
 Sam: I'm Sam Winchester, and this is my brother, Dean. We used to live here. You know, we were just drivin' by, and we were wondering if we could come see the old place. 
 JENNY: Winchester. Yeah, that's so funny. You know, I think I found some of your photos the other night. 
 Dean: You did? [JENNY nods and steps aside.] 
 JENNY: Come on in. [They go inside.] 
 [Inside the house, the three of them go to the kitchen. SARI is at the table doing homework. RITCHIE, her jumpy toddler brother, is in his playpen.] 
 RITCHIE: Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice! 
 JENNY: That's Ritchie. He's kind of a juice junkie. [She takes a sippy cup out of the refrigerator and hands it to RITCHIE.]But, hey, at least he won't get dirty. [She walks over to SARI.]Sari, this is Sam and Dean. They used to live here. 
 SARI: Hi. [Dean waves.] 
 Sam: Hey, Sari. 
 Dean: So, you just moved in? 
 JENNY: Yeah, from Wichita. 
 Dean: You got family here, or….? 
 JENNY: No. I just, uh….needed a fresh start, that's all. So, new town, new job –- I mean, as soon as I find one. New house. 
 Sam: So, how you likin' it so far? 
 JENNY: Well, uh, all due respect to your childhood home –- I mean, I'm sure you had lots of happy memories here. [Dean smiles weakly.]But this place has its issues. 
 Sam: What do you mean? 
 JENNY: Well, it's just getting old. Like the wiring, you know? We've got flickering lights almost hourly. 
 Dean: Oh, that's too bad. What else? 
 JENNY: Um…sink's backed up, there's rats in the basement. [She pauses.]I'm sorry. I don't mean to complain. 
 Dean: [not offended]No. Have you seen the rats or have you just heard scratching? 
 JENNY: It's just the scratching, actually. 
 SARI: Mom? [JENNY kneels down next to her.]Ask them if it was here when they lived here. 
 Sam: What, Sari? 
 SARI: The thing in my closet. 
 JENNY: Oh, no, baby, there was nothing in their closets. [to Sam and Dean]Right? 
 Sam: Right. No, no, of course not. 
 JENNY: She had a nightmare the other night. 
 SARI: I wasn't dreaming. It came into my bedroom –- and it was on fire. [Sam and Dean are shocked.] 
 [CUT TO: EXT. – Winchester HOUSE. Dean and Sam are walking back to the car.] 
 Sam: You hear that? A figure on fire. 
 Dean: And that woman, Jenny, that was the woman in your dreams? 
 Sam: Yeah. And you hear what she was talking about? Scratching, flickering lights, both signs of a malevolent spirit. 
 Dean: Yeah, well, I'm just freaked out that your weirdo visions are comin' true. 
 Sam: [panicked]Well, forget about that for a minute. The thing in the house, do you think it's the thing that killed Mom and Jessica? 
 Dean: I don't know! 
 Sam: Well, I mean, has it come back or has it been here the whole time? 
 Dean: Or maybe it's something else entirely, Sam, we don't know yet. 
 Sam: Well, those people are in danger, Dean. We have to get ‘em out of that house. 
 Dean: And we will. 
 Sam: No, I mean now. 
 Dean: And how you gonna do that, huh? You got a story that she's gonna believe? 
 Sam: Then what are we supposed to do? 
 [CUT TO: GAS STATION.] 
 Dean: We just gotta chill out, that's all. You know, if this was any other kind of job, what would we do? [Sam sighs.] 
 Sam: We'd try to figure out what we were dealin' with. We'd dig into the history of the house. 
 Dean: Exactly, except this time, we already know what happened. 
 Sam: Yeah, but how much do we know? I mean, how much do you actually remember? 
 Dean: About that night, you mean? 
 Sam: Yeah. 
 Dean: Not much. I remember the fire…the heat. [He pauses for a moment.]And then I carried you out the front door. 
 Sam: You did? 
 Dean: Yeah, what, you never knew that? 
 Sam: [shaking his head.]No. 
 Dean: And, well, you know Dad's story as well as I do. Mom was….was on the ceiling. And whatever put her there was long gone by the time Dad found her. 
 Sam: And he never had a theory about what did it? 
 Dean: If he did, he kept it to himself. God knows we asked him enough times. 
 Sam: Okay. So, if we're gonna figure out what's goin' on now…we have to figure out what happened back then. And see if it's the Same thing. 
 Dean: Yeah. We'll talk to Dad's friends, neighbors, people who were there at the time. 
 Sam: [after a pause]Does this feel like just another job to you? [Dean says nothing for a moment.] 
 Dean: I'll be right back. I gotta go to the bathroom. [He walks away. After turning a corner, he stands next to the bathroom door and takes out his cell phone. After making sure no one can see him, he dials a number.] 
 VOICEMAIL: This is John Winchester. If this is an emergency, call my son, Dean at 866-907-3235. [The beep sounds.] 
 Dean: Dad? I know I've left you messages before. I don't even know if you'll get ‘em. [He clears his throat.]But I'm with Sam. And we're in Lawrence. And there's somethin' in our old house. I don't know if it's the thing that killed Mom or not, but….[His voice breaks. He pauses, barely keeping himself together.]…I don't know what to do. [He begins to cry.]So, whatever you're doin', if you could get here. Please. I need your help, Dad. [He hangs up sadly, with tears in his eyes.] 
 [CUT TO: INT. – Winchester HOUSE. JENNY is showing a plumber to the kitchen, near the sink.] 
 JENNY: No, sir, nothing weird down there, I promise. Sink just backed up on its own. 
 PLUMBER: Well, I'll take a look. 
 JENNY: Thanks. Oh, okay, I'll get out of your way. 
 [She leaves. The plumber sets down his tools and begins looking at the pipes under the sink. A few feet away, by RITCHIE's playpen, a toy monkey is sitting with cymbals in its hands. Without warning, the monkey starts up. It clashes its cymbals together loudly while cackling. After a moment, the plumber looks up, confused. The toy stops. The plumber stands up and tries turning on the garbage disposal, but it doesn't work. Instead, he rolls up his sleeve and sticks his hand down the disposal. He thinks he feels something in the drain, but when he takes his hand out, there is nothing there. He sticks most of his arm back down the disposal. Suddenly, the garbage disposal starts up. The plumber's arm is being completely torn apart as blood splatters everywhere. At the Same time, the cymbal-clashing monkey starts up again, cackling as the plumber screams. The screen goes black.] 
 [FADE IN: GUENTHER's AUTO REPAIR. Dean and Sam are talking to the owner of the garage.] 
 Dean: So you and John Winchester, you used to own this garage together? 
 OWNER: Yeah, we used to, a long time ago. Matter of fact, it must be, uh…twenty years since John disappeared. So why the cops interested all of a sudden? 
 Dean: Oh, we're re-opening some of our unsolved cases, and the Winchester disappearance is one of ‘em. 
 OWNER: Oh, well, what do you wanna know about John? 
 Dean: Well, whatever you remember, you know, whatever sticks out in your mind. 
 OWNER: Well…he was a stubborn b*st*rd, I remember that. [He laughs.]And, uh, whatever the game, he hated to lose, you know? It's that whole Marine thing. [Dean and Sam nod.]But, oh, he sure loved Mary. And he doted on those kids. 
 Sam: But that was before the fire? 
 OWNER: That's right. 
 Sam: He ever talk about that night? 
 OWNER: No, not at first. I think he was in shock. 
 Sam: Right. But eventually? What did he say about it? 
 OWNER: Oh, he wasn't thinkin' straight. He said somethin' caused that fire and killed Mary. 
 Dean: He ever say what did it? 
 OWNER: Nothin' did it. It was an accident –- an electrical short in the ceiling or walls or somethin'. I begged him to get some help, but…. 
 Dean: But what? 
 OWNER: Oh, he just got worse and worse. 
 Dean: How? 
 OWNER: Oh, he started readin' these strange ol' books. He started goin' to see this palm reader in town. 
 Dean: Palm reader? Uh, do you have a name? 
 OWNER: [scoffs]No. 
 [CUT TO: Impala. The car is parked by a payphone, where Sam is looking through a phonebook.] 
 Sam: All right, so there are a few psychics and palm readers in town. There's someone named El Divino. There's, uh –-[He laughs.]—there's the Mysterious Mister Fortinsky. Uh, Missouri Moseley— 
 Dean: Wait, wait. Missouri Moseley? 
 Sam: What? 
 Dean: That's a psychic? 
 Sam: Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess so. [Dean goes into the backseat of the car and pulls out John's journal.] 
 Dean: In Dad's journal…here, look at this. [He opens to the first page.]First page, first sentence, read that. 
 Sam: [reading]I went to Missouri and I learned the truth. 
 Dean: [shrugging]I always thought he meant the state. 
 [CUT TO: INT – MISSOURI's HOUSE. MISSOURI MOSELEY is escorting a man out of the house while Dean and Sam sit on the couch, waiting.] 
 MISSOURI: All right, there. Don't you worry ‘bout a thing. Your wife is crazy about you. [The man thanks her and she closes the front door behind him.]Whew. Poor b*st*rd. His woman is cold-bangin' the gardener. 
 Dean: Why didn't you tell him? 
 MISSOURI: People don't come here for the truth. They come for good news. [The boys stare at her.]Well? Sam and Dean, come on already, I ain't got all day. [She leaves the room. Dean and Sam exchange a confused look and follow her into the next room.]Well, lemme look at ya. [She laughs.]Oh, you boys grew up handsome. [She points a finger at Dean.]And you were one goofy-lookin' kid, too. [Dean glares at her while Sam smirks.]Sam. [She grabs his hand.]Oh, honey…I'm sorry about your girlfriend. [The boys are shocked.]And your father –- he's missin'? 
 Sam: How'd you know all that? 
 MISSOURI: Well, you were just thinkin' it just now. [Sam raises his eyebrows, surprised.] 
 Dean: Well, where is he? Is he okay? 
 MISSOURI: I don't know. 
 Dean: Don't know? Well, you're supposed to be a psychic, right? 
 MISSOURI: Boy, you see me sawin' some bony tramp in half? You think I'm a magician? I may be able to read thoughts and sense energies in a room, but I can't just pull facts out of thin air. Sit, please. [Sam smirks at Dean and they sit down. MISSOURI snaps at Dean.]Boy, you put your foot on my coffee table, I'm ‘a whack you with a spoon! 
 Dean: I didn't do anything. 
 MISSOURI: But you were thinkin' about it. [Dean raises his eyebrows. Sam smiles.] 
 Sam: Okay. So, our dad –- when did you first meet him? 
 MISSOURI: He came for a reading. A few days after the fire. I just told him what was really out there in the dark. I guess you could say…I drew back the curtains for him. 
 Dean: What about the fire? Do you know about what killed our mom? 
 MISSOURI: A little. Your daddy took me to your house. He was hopin' I could sense the echoes, the fingerprints of this thing. 
 Sam: And could you? 
 MISSOURI: I….[She shakes her head.] 
 Sam: What was it? 
 MISSOURI: [softly]I don't know. Oh, but it was evil. 
 
 
 
 [CUT TO: INT. – Winchester HOUSE. JENNY is on the phone in the kitchen while RITCHIE jumps around in his playpen.] 
 JENNY: Look, I feel just awful about the poor man's hand. […]Wait, but how can I be held liable? […]Yeah, but I can't afford a Lawyer. [She begins to hear noises from upstairs.]Okay, listen, you just gotta let me call you back. [She hangs up.]Ritchie, um, Mommy's gonna be right back, okay? 
 RITCHIE: Okay. [JENNY leaves the room.] 
 [CUT TO: MISSOURI's HOUSE.] 
 MISSOURI: So…you think somethin' is back in that house? 
 Sam: Definitely. 
 MISSOURI: I don't understand. 
 Sam: What? 
 MISSOURI: I haven't been back inside, but I've been keepin' an eye on the place, and it's been quiet. No sudden deaths, no freak accidents. Why is it actin' up now? 
 Sam: I don't know. But Dad going missing and Jessica dying and now this house all happening at once –- it just feels like something's starting. 
 Dean: That's a comforting thought. 
 [CUT TO: Winchester HOUSE.] 
 [While RITCHIE is alone in the kitchen, one of the screws on his playpen mysteriously comes out of place. One of the playpen's sides falls to the floor. At the Same time, the safety latch on the door of the refrigerator comes undone. The refrigerator opens. Curious, RITCHIE walks over to it. Inside, he sees his sippy cup full of juice.] 
 RITCHIE: Juicy. [He climbs into the refrigerator and sits on one of the shelves. Suddenly, the refrigerator door closes and the safety latch locks into place. The screen goes black.] 
 [FADE IN: Winchester HOUSE. JENNY returns to the kitchen.] 
 JENNY: Oh, baby, either we have rats or Mommy's going crazy. [She sees that the playpen is empty.]Ritchie? Ritchie?! [Panicked, she rushes into the other rooms and tries to find him.]Baby, where are you?! [She comes back into the kitchen, breathing heavily. She sees milk leaking out from inside the refrigerator. She goes over to it and opens the door.] 
 RITCHIE: Mommy. 
 JENNY: Oh my God! [She takes RITCHIE out of the refrigerator and holds him in her arms. A few moments later, there is a knock on the door. She answers it and sees Sam, Dean, and MISSOURI.]Sam, Dean. What are you doing here? 
 Sam: Hey, Jenny. This is our friend, Missouri. 
 Dean: If it's not too much trouble, we were hoping to show her the old house. You know, for old time's sake. 
 JENNY: You know, this isn't a good time. I'm kind of busy. 
 Dean: Listen, Jenny, it's important. [MISSOURI smacks him on the back of the head.]Ow! 
 MISSOURI: Give the poor girl a break, can't you see she's upset? [to JENNY]Forgive this boy, he means well, he's just not the sharpest tool in the shed, but hear me out. [Dean looks stunned.] 
 JENNY: About what? 
 MISSOURI: About this house. 
 JENNY: What are you talking about? 
 MISSOURI: I think you know what I'm talking about. You think there's something in this house, something that wants to hurt your family. Am I mistaken? 
 JENNY: Who are you? 
 MISSOURI: We're people who can help, who can stop this thing. But you're gonna have to trust us, just a little. [JENNY looks unsure.] 
 [A few moments later, MISSOURI and the boys are in SARI's bedroom.] 
 MISSOURI: If there's a dark energy around here, this room should be the center of it. 
 Sam: Why? 
 MISSOURI: This used to be your nursery, Sam. This is where it all happened. [Sam glances at the ceiling. While MISSOURI looks around the room, Dean pulls out his EMF meter.]That an EMF? 
 Dean: Yeah. 
 MISSOURI: Amateur. [Dean glares at her. He nudges Sam and shows him that the EMF is beeping frantically.]I don't know if you boys should be disappointed or relieved, but this ain't the thing that took your mom. 
 Sam: Wait, are you sure? [She nods.]How do you know? 
 MISSOURI: It isn't the Same energy I felt the last time I was here. It's somethin' different. 
 Dean: What is it? 
 MISSOURI. Not it. [She opens the closet.]Them. There's more than one spirit in this place. 
 Dean: What are they doing here? 
 MISSOURI: They're here because of what happened to your family. You see, all those years ago, real evil came to you. It walked this house. That kind of evil leaves wounds. And sometimes, wounds get infected. 
 Sam: I don't understand. 
 MISSOURI: This place is a magnet for paranormal energy. It's attracted a poltergeist. A nasty one. And it won't rest until Jenny and her babies are dead. 
 Sam: You said there was more than one spirit. 
 MISSOURI: There is. I just can't quite make out the second one. 
 Dean: Well, one thing's for damn sure –- nobody's dyin' in this house ever again. So whatever is here, how do we stop it? 
 [CUT TO: MISSOURI's HOUSE. Dean, Sam, and MISSOURI are sitting around a table. On the table are different herbs and roots.] 
 Dean: So, what is all this stuff, anyway? 
 MISSOURI: Angelica Root, Van Van oil, crossroad dirt, a few other odds and ends. 
 Dean: Yeah? What are we supposed to do with it? 
 MISSOURI: We're gonna put them inside the walls in the north, south, east, west corners on each floor of the house. 
 Dean: We'll be punchin' holes in the dry wall. Jenny's gonna love that. 
 MISSOURI: [slyly]She'll live. 
 Sam: And this'll desTroy the spirits? 
 MISSOURI: It should. It should purify the house completely. We'll each take a floor. But we work fast. Once the spirits realize what we're up to, things are gonna get bad. 
 [CUT TO: EXT. – Winchester HOUSE. MISSOURI is walking JENNY and her kids outside.] 
 JENNY: Look, I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving you guys here alone. 
 MISSOURI: Just take your kids to the movies or somethin', and it'll be over by the time you get back. [JENNY, still slightly unsure, leaves with her kids. MISSOURI goes back inside.] 
 [Inside the house, Sam goes into one of the rooms with a hammer. He kneels down by the wall and begins using the end of the hammer to hit against the walls. While he is doing this, a plug on the other side of the room takes itself out of the outlet. A lamp begins to move on its own also. The plug snakes its way towards Sam. Downstairs in the kitchen, Dean is punching the wall with a small ax. Behind him, a drawer begins to open on its own. In the basement, MISSOURI is looking around. She brings a bag full of herbs to the wall. She hears a noise and turns around to see a table coming towards her. She screams as it pins her against the wall. Back in the kitchen, Dean also hears a noise. He quickly ducks just as a knife hurls itself into a cabinet. Dean places a table in front of himself as more knives come through it. Upstairs, Sam is chopping a hole in the wall. The lamp crashes to the ground. Sam turns around to see what the noise was, and the cord wraps itself around his neck. Sam falls to the ground, trying to get the cord off. Eventually, he lays weak on the floor. Dean runs upstairs and into the room.] 
 Dean: Sam! 
 [Dean rushes over to Sam and tries to get the cord off, but it won't budge. Instead, Dean kicks a hole in the wall and places the bag of herbs inside. A blinding white light leaves the room. Once the spirit is gone, Dean goes back over to Sam, who is completely weak. Dean unravels the cord from around Sam's neck and pulls him into a fierce hug. The screen goes black.] 
 [FADE IN: INT. – Winchester HOUSE. A few hours later, Dean, Sam, and MISSOURI are standing in the extremely messy kitchen.] 
 Sam: You sure this is over? 
 MISSOURI: I'm sure. Why? Why do you ask? 
 Sam: Never mind. [He sighs.]It's nothin', I guess. [They hear JENNY enter the house.] 
 JENNY: Hello? We're home. [She comes into the kitchen and looks around.]What happened? 
 Sam: Hi, sorry. Um, we'll pay for all of this. [Dean looks confused.] 
 MISSOURI: Don't you worry. Dean's gonna clean up this mess. [Dean stands there, not moving.]Well, what are you waiting for, boy? Get the mop. [He begins walking away.]And don't cuss at me! [Dean walks away, muttering under his breath. A little while later, MISSOURI and the boys leave the house. JENNY waves and shuts the door behind them.] 
 [Later that night, JENNY is in bed, reading a magazine. She yawns and puts the magazine on her bedside table. After turning off the light and sliding underneath the covers, she goes to sleep. A few seconds later, she opens her eyes, startled. The bed begins to shake violently. She screams and gets out of bed. Meanwhile, outside, Dean and Sam are sitting in the car.] 
 Dean: All right, so, tell me again, what are we still doin' here? 
 Sam: I don't know. I just…I still have a bad feeling. 
 Dean: Why? Missouri did her whole Zelda Rubenstein thing, the house should be clean, it should be over. 
 Sam: Yeah, well, probably. But I just wanna make sure, that's all. 
 Dean: Yeah, well, problem is I could be sleeping in a bed right now. [He slides down in his seat and closes his eyes. Sam looks up at JENNY's bedroom window and sees her screaming, just as in his dream.] 
 Sam: Dean. Look, Dean! [They rush out of the car and run towards the house.] 
 Dean: You grab the kids, I'll get Jenny. 
 [Inside SARI's bedroom, the figure made out of fire is standing by her closet. In the hallway, Dean rushes to JENNY's bedroom door.] 
 Dean: Jenny! 
 JENNY: I can't open the door! 
 Dean: Stand back! [She moves back. Dean kicks down the door and brings her downstairs.] 
 JENNY: No, my kids! 
 Dean: Sam's got your kids, come on. 
 [While carrying RITCHIE in his arms, Sam goes to SARI's bedroom, where she is screaming for help. Sam goes to SARI's bed and picks her up in his other arm.] 
 Sam: Don't look. Don't look! [They leave the bedroom. Outside, Dean and JENNY rush out of the house. Inside the house, Sam rushes down the stairs and puts the kids down on the floor.]All right, Sari, take your brother outside as fast as you can, and don't look back. [Suddenly, an invisible force makes Sam fall to the floor. He slides backwards into another room, crashing into a table. SARI screams and runs outside with RITCHIE. They rush outside to Dean and JENNY. Dean kneels down to SARI's eye level.] 
 Dean: Sari, where's Sam? 
 SARI: [crying]He's inside. Something's got him. [Panicked, Dean looks at the front door. It slams shut on its own, and the screen goes black.] 
 [FADE IN: EXT – Winchester HOUSE. Dean opens the trunk of the Impala and grabs a rifle and an ax. He rushes to the front door and begins chopping away at it. Inside the kitchen, Sam gets flung into a set of cabinets. He stands up and is pinned against the wall by the invisible force. He can't move any part of his body. The fire figure makes its way towards Sam. Dean continues chopping down parts of the door. Eventually, he makes a hole that he is able to step through. He walks through the house, looking for Sam.] 
 Dean: Sam? Sam! [He finds Sam. As he looks at the fire figure, he raises his gun.] 
 Sam: No, don't! Don't! 
 Dean: What, why?! 
 Sam: Because I know who it is. I can see her now. 
 [Suddenly, the fire vanishes. Instead, standing in front of them is Mary Winchester, exactly as she was the night she died. Dean's expression softens. In shock, he lowers his gun slowly.] 
 Dean: [softly]Mom? [Mary smiles and steps closer to him.] 
 Mary: Dean. [Tears form in Dean's eyes. Mary walks away from him and goes to Sam. Dean watches her, never taking his eyes off her.]Sam. [Sam smiles weakly, crying. His mother's smile fades.]I'm sorry. 
 Sam: For what? [She looks at him sadly, but says nothing. She walks away from them and looks up at the ceiling.] 
 Mary: You get out of my house. And let go of my son. [Once again, she bursts into flames. When she is entirely engulfed, the fire reaches the ceiling and disappears. The force holding Sam to the wall is released. He walks over to Dean, and the two of them look at each other, stunned.] 
 Sam: Now it's over. 
 [The next morning, Dean is standing by the car with JENNY, looking through old photos.] 
 Dean: Thanks for these. 
 JENNY: Don't thank me, they're yours. [Dean puts the trunk of photos into the car. Sitting on the front steps of the house, Sam is joined by MISSOURI.] 
 MISSOURI: Well, there are no spirits in there anymore, this time for sure. 
 Sam: Not even my mom? 
 MISSOURI: No. 
 Sam: What happened? 
 MISSOURI: Your mom's spirit and the poltergeist's energy, they cancelled each other out. Your mom desTroyed herself goin' after the thing. 
 Sam: Why would she do something like that? 
 MISSOURI: Well, to protect her boys, of course. [Sam nods, with tears in his eyes. MISSOURI goes to put her hand on his shoulder, but she stops herself.]Sam, I'm sorry. 
 Sam: For what? 
 MISSOURI: You sensed it was here, didn't you? Even when I couldn't. 
 Sam: What's happening to me? 
 MISSOURI: I know I should have all the answers, but I don't know. 
 Dean: Sam, you ready? [Sam nods and goes to the car. JENNY thanks all of them.] 
 MISSOURI: Don't you boys be strangers. 
 Dean: We won't. 
 MISSOURI: See you around. [JENNY waves. They smile, get in the car, and drive away.] 
 [CUT TO: INT. – MISSOURI's HOUSE. MISSOURI comes inside and sets her purse on the table.] 
 MISSOURI: That boy…he has such powerful abilities. But why he couldn't sense his own father, I have no idea. [The camera pans over to her couch, where John Winchester is sitting.] 
 John: Mary's spirit –- do you really think she saved the boys? 
 MISSOURI: I do. [John nods sadly and twists his wedding ring on his finger.]John Winchester, I could just slap you. Why won't you go talk to your children? 
 John: [tearfully]I want to. You have no idea how much I wanna see ‘em. But I can't. Not yet. Not until I know the truth. [They share a look. The screen fades to black.]
