 Manolis : Previously on The Slap... 
 We are taking you all to Greece. 
 I can't do it. 
 Is everything going to be okay with this trip, right? 
 Yeah, I hope so. 
 Look at this tremendous vehicle. 
 Takes a great man to drive a car such as this. 
 Connie handed in her notice yesterday. 
 Anouk : It is quite possible he is having a torrid affair. 
 You acted in defense of another. 
 He was gonna strike my child. 
 Hector : You go to trial? 
 What if you do a Harry, and your head explodes on the stand? 
 If I had a kid and Harry slapped it I would kill him myself, but I wouldn't drag in the law. 
 I'm Officer Forrester. 
 Harry : They want to fight? 
 I'm gonna destroy them. 
 This is a shakedown, huh? 
 You actually think this is about money? 
 Talked to the prosecutor, and she said that this establishes a propensity towards violence. 
 What's going on here could scar us all for a long time. 
 Listen to me. 
 Do you hit your wife? 
 [Cries] 
 Male narrator : Manolis couldn't sleep. 
 He studied the ceiling of his bedroom, looking for an answer, and remembered how his own grandfather would gaze at the grounds in his coffee cup in hopes of seeing the future. 
 He could almost hear the old man's voice. 
 "It's your job to fix this. 
 No one else can save our family." Oh, look at you. Where are you going all dressed up? What? It's a secret? I'm back on the coffee route. And if I needed a secretary, I'd call the service. I have a bunch of stuff, bank, audiologist. Yeah, well, why don't you stop and visit Dimitrios along the way? This is why I don't report my every movement to you, because you turn a nice, pleasant day into a... [Groans] It's Dimitrios. You can't keep putting it off forever. I know, I know, I know. Stop. How's my tie? I bought you that tie for your retirement party. Listen, if you are going to see Dimitrios, stop off at Artopolis for some koulouria, the sugar ones. He loved those. Loves. He's not done yet. Manolis, how long are you going to go on pretending we're all going to be here forever. Here. I can do it. All right. Bye. Have a good day. Woman : Mr. Apostolou? I'm Mr. Korkoulis' assistant, Runya Stamos. So nice to meet you. Come with me. Pleasure. Lovely office, the view. You should see it at night when New York looks like Christmas. Manolis. I was so thrilled to hear from you. Out of the blue, I was just thinking of you, huh? Thanassis, I'm so happy you would see me like this. Hey. You met Runya, huh? Working her way through Fordham Law, modeled in Milan, and she's going to take over this place after she kills me. Right, Runy? You're indestructible, Thanassis. I've tried. Yes, you have. Did you offer Mr. Apostolou coffee? It's your brand, Mano. No, I'm fine. Thank you, Miss Stamos. [Laughs] You've spent your entire life since you were a baby surrounded by beautiful women. What is your secret? My secret? Make women your religion. That way, they'll always know. We have so much to catch up on. My God. Have you seen Dimitrios? No, I've been meaning to many times, but... No, no, no. There's no need to explain. It's hard. It's very hard to see someone, especially someone you love, wither away into nothing. It's hard. Too hard for some. Enough of that. Please sit. Tell me, what's so urgent? So the thing is, look, yes, the judge said we can move forward, but what are we getting in terms of statements? We have a burden of proof that damage occurred, and it's a single incident. Yes, but it was a hard slap. Yeah, well, it's difficult to pursue a single incident. But, Bridget, you could hear the slap. Everybody saw. And the judge determined... All of that was, babe, is that we can go ahead. I keep saying that. Bridget : Look, I also... There's gonna be... They're going to ask questions about your son. You should be prepared. Like what? If he has any control issues. What do you mean by that? What... Gary, what does she mean by that? Relax, Rosie, she has to ask this stuff. He's a normal little boy, that's all. Let's move on. Miss Cole. Dr. Cole. Dr. Cole. Mr. A-pasta-lou. Apo-sto-lou. He's your husband's cousin? That's right. If this is a tendency, that can be very persuasive with the judge. What do you mean by "tendency"? Is he violent, doctor? Has he done this before, is what we mean. Thanassis : That's a hell of a story. A real American mess. I don't want to screw around. I want this over. My family is... We're taking them all to Greece, and I don't want this hanging over the trip. Hmm. The thing about cases like this, Mano, they play on sympathy, on emotions. Even a hard-nosed judge could be turned around by stories of a kid getting hit. But there is a way. What kind of home does the kid live in? My son Hector, he could speak to that. Yeah. Listen. I'm so busy now, huh? It's not like it used to be. This is a big operation. I have partners; I have a board. I see. I understand. You know what? Screw 'em. I'm going to move some things around. You, me, Hector, the nephew Harry with the temper, we have lunch on Monday at my club. We have a good steak, a lobster, on me. Hmm? I can't tell you how grateful I am, old friend. This means the world. Take that worried look off of your face. Are you having any fun? Oh... my grandchildren are a great source of joy to me. Grandchildren. Uh-huh. I'm not talking about that kind of fun. Gorgeous Koula, is she enough for you? That girl outside, she keeps me up all night. Those little pills, thank God for them, huh? Maybe we need to get you laid. Thanassis, please, let's not discuss my s*x life. Mano. Look at poor Dimitrios, dying in drips and drabs. Live. Fornicate a little. Laugh. "Fornicate a little." Mano, my motto, which I learned in America, life is too short for anything other than pleasure and victory. In that order? Pleasure and victory, my friend. Narrator : Manolis left feeling that his powers as the patriarch were still intact. And whatever distrust he had felt for his old friend years ago no longer mattered. There was a job to do. And for that instant, Manolis believed that he, in fact, could see the future. [Soft jazz music] Come on, Uncle. Thanassis? What kind of lawyer is he, anyway? The effective kind. I already talked to Jay Goldman about this. He's great with this bottom feeder stuff. He's sharp as a tack, mean as a snake. Jay Goldman is not a lawyer. He is a friend from high school with a law degree. There is a difference. Thanassis was a trusted advisor to old man Onassis himself. I know what I'm doing. Harry : Right. We're meeting him. Okay. Fine, we're meeting him. Aisha : Hi. Hey, Rocco, how's your face, love? Hey, Dad. Hi. Aisha, my dear, you look lovely. Oh, thank you. So they let you have Sunday off. A miracle. Part of Sunday. I have to go in later. Ah. This is fantastic cherry pie from Red Hook. Ah. It's insanely good. I'll take it to Koula in the kitchen. Koula. How you doing, Aisha? Yeah, good. Hey. I'm gonna grab a beer. Aisha : Hi, Koula. Koula : Oh, you're here. I thought you had to work. They found someone to replace you today, I see. Adam : Rocco, look at your face. Rocco : What? Aisha, we're taking Rocco to see  Wicked  on Thursday night. Do you want to join? We could get tickets for you guys, maybe grab a bite before? Oh, that's so nice, Sandi, but, of course, I have to work late at the clinic that night. I have a council thing. Oh, yeah. But we could take Adam and Melissa, though. Yeah, sure. We took Hector to all the Broadway shows because Manolis supplied the coffee to the Broadway houses. Shuberts get us tickets to everything. Cats,  five times. Oh, Aisha, my dear, would you take this out, please? Aisha : Oh, of course. Koula : Thank you. All right. Harry : What'd you call me? [Growls playfully] What I catch, huh? Did I catch a mouse? Did I catch a mouse? [Growls] What about you, buddy, huh? You think you can take me? No way, right? Huh? Here. Don't tell anybody; share with your sister. It's for both of you, huh? Don't buy drugs. What? [Scoffs] Hector. Hmm? I need you to meet me and your cousin tomorrow for lunch with Thanassis. Thanassis the lawyer? I thought you couldn't stand him. He's always lording it over you... Let me worry about who I can and can't stand. Harry : Listen, Hector. I got to ask you something. Aisha. She's barely looked at me. Is this gonna be a problem? Hey, come on. Well, who's side is she gonna take in this, cousin? It's really complicated. Rosie is her best friend. She went to the D.A. with her. She can't say no to her. Manolis : Wait. Say this again. You have to understand, she's in a terrible position. Terrible. I've been asked to shepherd you to the dining table for lunch. Let's eat. [Voices overlapping] Hmm. Ah. Look at those tomatoes. People don't believe in global warming, I have news for them: I have tomatoes right into December. I hate what we're doing to this planet. Oh, Mano. Everything changes. You learn more facts, yet you have less wisdom. I saw on public television... Mm-hmm. That the octopus has a soul, feelings, enormous emotions, love, even, memories. They're so much like us. I can't eat them anymore. What kind of world are we leaving to our kids, eh? You know, the most we can do is give them a sense that their world is... Temporarily, at least... Safe. I agree. But are we doing a very good job of that? Not all the time, no. [Sighs] And what do we do when the adults behave like kids? Well, which adult are we referring to, Dad? Ugh. Any number of them. In this case, I can influence a few, at least. I hope. Listen to me. We must come together as best we can. I have upgraded us to the premium economy so that the trip to Greece is easier, much more comfortable. You're such a smart man. Dad, you and I both know this is not about what class we fly. But it is about family. Promise me you'll think about it, hmm? Come to Greece. We show everyone how we overcome our problems and be together. That no matter what, family always comes first. Yes? Yes. ["Here Comes Your Man" by Pixies playing] ♪ Big shake on the box car moving ♪

♪ Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing ♪ 
♪ A big, big stone fall and break my crown ♪ [Clattering sounds] [Hugo screams] [Clattering continues] Rosie : Honey, be careful. [Growls] Darling, not so rough. Hugo : Boom. I can't stand here waiting for him forever. Would you please just be patient? He's an incredibly busy man. Thanassis : Forgive me, my friends. Forgive me. I am so sorry to keep you waiting. Some clients don't know when to shut up. Manolis : You remember my son Hector. And this is my nephew Harry. Yes, of course, look at you. I knew your parents before they were married, before anybody. And your mom, she was the most gorgeous thing. She's still, yeah. And you, Harry. You're the one who hits women and small children. Yeah, I didn't hit a woman. Ah, so you admit to hitting the kid. [Chuckles] Manolis : He's joking. Ah, but look at the temper on this. Hmm? It took me half a second to get you nuts. Before we next go to court, I'm getting my doctor to give you something. A beta blocker, drugs, something. Hey. I knew your papa. He got my broke-ass E-type to run like a soft pussycat hunting a little birdie. We're all here. Gentlemen. Thanassis : Before I forget, look what I found in a drawer. Look, this is us, full of piss and vinegar. Or something. Yeah. Nothing scared us, Mano. Huh? And poor Dimitrios, lying on death's door. But you, me, we're still standing, yes? Still standing. [Laughs] 
 
 This is for you. Oh. And now, we eat. I had some of the boys do a little work for us already. Did you know that this child was born out of wedlock, a b*st*rd? Who cares when they got married? A judge, a jury. People care about recognizable structures that they are comfortable in. Believe me, you think this is a modern world? [Laughs] It is ancient. And did you know that the father, Gary Weshler, was twice arrested at the Occupy Wall Street marches? He's an anarchist, a civil disobedient. Hector : Thanassis, the cops cornered these people and basically stripped them of their rights. A good American father does not get into altercations with the police over Wall Street. Oh, yes, and he also has a DUI. Is that a good parent? And then there's this woman, yes, Rosie. She has at least one incident with social services. Hector : What exactly is going on here? Let him finish, Hector. Hey, let's not... No, no, no, Mano, let's. You know, don't you? Rosie and my wife are very close. I have to respect their confidence. And that's more important than keeping Harry here out of Rikers Island? Well? Cuz, is it? Rosie, she's had emotional difficulties in the past, but that's not on the table. Manolis : I'm sorry, but what does her emotional state have to do with the slap? She's a good mother and friends with my wife and me, and I will not be party to some sleazy lawyerly smear. Ooh, and what about the smear on Harry? What about that? What about people who tried to conflate a simple slap into a life-altering trauma? Is that not a sleaze? My guess is, this is all preparation for a very nasty lawsuit where they go after Harry's assets, which I understand to be quite considerable. Hector : My cousin hit their kid. It was wrong. Say what you will about the response, but, Dad, do you see what's going on here? Harry : What are you talking about? This is interesting. I apologize for not apologizing, but this is dirty business. I have our own shrink evaluate the kid. We find that he has a major anger problem and undiagnosed rage. He's five years old. Manolis : I agree with Hector. I'm sorry, but we don't want to drag them through the mud. Really, no. That's... That's... That's not right. Mano, my dear, you have done a good job, but your work is done. Go home. Enjoy your beautiful wife. Drink some wine. But now we will take it, Harry and me. Harry : Uncle. This man gets it. These people are asking for it. We cannot be gentle here. This is code for character assassination. That's code for returning fire, Hector. This isn't what I wanted. Oh. No, no, no. No, no, Mano. No, no, no, no, no. I have this, please. I owe you much, Mano. Besides, this is a private club. Money never exchanges hands here. So that is that. Harry. To be continued. Harry : Thank you. That is a guy, huh, Uncle? Comes over here, makes something of himself, gets it, protects his own. You did a really good thing bringing him onto this. I feel... I feel like I'm getting ahead of this thing. I love you. I love you too. I got to go see a '67 Cobra. Gorgeous American car. Best we ever made. I'm sorry. I didn't, um... No, no. You didn't. I will control this. I promise you. Oh, Dad. Don't you get it? You already lost. I can fix it. Hmm. I can. Go home, Dad. Go home. Ooh. Oh. [Groaning] [Groaning continues] [Telephone ringing] You're... Oh, my God, you're Hector's dad. Uh-huh. I thought I recognized you. We met at the... Barbecue, yes? Yeah. You were there, yes? Yeah, Connie. Manolis. Hi. That was awful. Yeah, that was terrible how it ruined Hector's party. How is he? He's a good son. I'm proud of him. Yeah, God, you must be. Did he tell you about the new plan for the park in the Bronx that he's working on? Yes, very exciting. Yeah, he's personally in charge of the whole thing. He's so... The whole City Planning Department is behind it. You're close to Hector? Um... I think he's a great man. He was just telling me about this article he wrote about how city planning is for everyone but mostly for children, which... Aisha : Manolis. Sorry, Connie. Manolis : Ah, darling. I hate to come by with no appointment; I do. But I had a little scare today, and I just wanted, quietly, to see you. What kind? Well, uh... I don't know what it was. My heart was beating so fast, it wouldn't slow down. Oh, dear. Is there any way you could shoehorn an old man into a... An already overburdened day? Just give me one sec. Yeah. Of course. Come on back. Hi. [Air pump hissing] Yeah. It's actually great. Now, you've got to follow up with your own doctor, okay? Get them to do some blood work. Yeah? You know the medical community frowns on doctors treating members of their own family. [Chuckles] I'll see you out front. Aisha, listen to me. I know how close to Rosie you are. I want to ask you, please, can you get her to withdraw the case against Harry? The lawyers for Harry are going to hit very hard, ugly, ugly, dark things. Wait. The lawyer that you sent him to? Thanassis? I'm sorry, but that's how things are done nowadays. Maybe I've not spent enough time around these things. I'm trying to fix it. But the best thing is to get her to withdraw and drop the case. And as her friend, you'll be helping her. No. Please. Please talk sense to her. I can't do that. And they have a right to see him punished for what he did. But everyone will be hurt. The family. Aisha. To lose everything because of slapping some stupid kid, hmm? Oh, Mano. You don't know anything. First of all, Rosie is family to me, as much as the family I married into. And secondly... What? Seven years ago, Sandi came to our house in the middle of the night. She'd been hit hard round her face. She had a cut on her face, Manolis. I treated her. His ring must have caught her. She has a scar if you look closely. She keeps it covered very well. Very well with makeup. We... I calmed her down, and we agreed that we would never, ever speak of it. Never say anything. And even though I knew it was wrong, so very wrong, I went along with it, knowing that he would one day do it again. Although I must admit, I never imagined he'd hit a little boy. I don't understand. Harry? Harry did this? Hit his wife? And you all kept it a secret? [Scoffs] I don't know if it was to protect you or him. But I felt guilty about it every day since. So if I was to go and get Rosie to somehow stop this thing, Harry would, once again, have hurt someone freely, and I would, once again, have been complicit in that. And that I will not do. Do you understand? I can't have any more of this on my conscience. I'm sorry, Dad. It's just one lie too much for me. [Somber music] Man : Hey, man, spare some change? God bless. [Somber music] Woman : Hello there. Hi. I'm looking for Harry. Oh, he's on a call. Ah. We just got it in this morning. Owned by a very famous comedian. I'm sure it was. Go on. Sit in it. It suits you. Takes a very great man to drive a car like this. Harry : Don't listen to her, Uncle, she's hustling you. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. This is a man who cannot be played. Right, Mano? We need to talk. Yeah, come up. You want a drink, anything? No. No, thank you. I am fine. Oh, come on. We got a lot to celebrate. I already talked to Thanassis again today. He's all over this. Ah, aha. So what's up? Harry. When we first came to this country, it wasn't so easy, you know. Learning a new language, getting the right job, school for you and Hector... Making a new life, all of it. I know. I know how hard you worked. No. No, it was a privilege. I mean, I didn't become rich, but it didn't matter. But what was important is that you and Hector were taken care of and that... You were decent. Why are you saying this, Uncle? What did you do to your wife? What? What are you talking about? Years ago... Did you hit Sandi? [Scoffs] What is this? Is this Aisha again, stirring things up? 'Cause I swear to God, that woman... Stop. I asked you a question,  anipsiós . Did you hit your wife? No. Have we had our rough patches? Have we fought? Yes, of course. Of course we have, Uncle Mano. I don't deny it. I grabbed her once. Maybe too hard, maybe I bruised her. I don't even know. But have I ever hit Sandi? Listen to me, Uncle Mano, I swear to you, never. How could I? She's my wife. But why would Aisha say such a thing? Look. Aisha and I have our own issues, but I'll say this much. As much as I hate to have her as an enemy, I'd love to have her as a friend. I mean, look at what she's doing for Rosie. I mean, if Sandi went over there, and Aisha thought she was upset or hurt, I can't do anything about that. You know, we're all just trying to get through this the best we can. Besides, you know Sandi. You think she'd stay with me if it was true? Hmm. Come here. I'm sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. Now, let me have Meme drive you home. No, no, no, no. I have... I have to visit someone else. [Buzzer sounds] Woman : Hello? It's Manolis. Woman : Manolis. Really? Come up. Well... My feet just sort of brought me here. I hope you don't mind me coming by like this to see Dimitrios. What do you think, sweetie? He'll be so damn happy. I just made coffee. Mitso. I hope you've come to finish me off. Help me to get up, will you, my old friend? [Groaning] Come on, Mano. Stop with that miserable old horse face. I'm not dead yet. [Grunting] I'm ashamed of how long it's been since I've seen you. Please forgive me. Dimitrios : Listen. It's just good to see you. Besides, you gave us free coffee for 20-some years. [Laughs] I probably owe you $5,000. [Laughter] Let's have some Metaxa. Maybe you shouldn't. I definitely shouldn't, but... But I'm gonna. [Laughs] To heaven and to children. [Laughs] Ya mas. Ya mas.

How do I know when you're in the mood for Chinese? I see it in your face. [Laughs] What God lets happen to us I wouldn't let happen to a dog. Do you want some tea and cookies? And Thanassis is an unholy monster. [Koula chuckles] Yes. And you did not once ask my opinion about seeing that man. I'll never understand what you saw in him. Manolis, I chose you. Hmm. He's, how do you say in English? He's a  papagálos . "Papagálos." Popinjay. Yeah, well, the popinjay has turned into a vulture. [Sighs] Koula, do you think we did a good job as parents? I mean, look at Harry, Hector. So many problems. Did we do this? Do what? Did we neglect anything? Neglect? Maybe the opposite. We did too much, perhaps. They're a mess. Oh, poor Manolis. I miss holding him as a baby. Oh. You know what I miss? Johnny Carson. [Laughs] Don't you get it? We did our best. We're almost done here. Why do you think people have children when they're young? Because only the young can raise children. We can't. Harry has problems. Mm-hmm. He does. And there's only so much we can do. Trips and cakes and watching. Cakes and watching. Is that all we're good for now? Manolis, don't you understand? What? They don't need us anymore. So I bring too much food. It's my way of saying, "I'm older than you, and bounty is a blessing." Who cares if they get it or not? And you dispense advice like some kind of wise man. [Laughs] [Laughs] My Koula. [Both laugh] Manolis, you are a wise man. You know a lot. But how long will it take you to realize that there's not much more we can do. Cheer for the grandkids, make the right noises, and hope for the best. We're on our own now. Just you and me. They don't need us anymore. But I do. Narrator : Manolis had exhausted himself now. He could finally put all the worries aside and let events take their natural course. Harry would or would not pay for his crimes, and whatever happened would be neither because of or in spite of Manolis' efforts. [Imitating engine revving] Bam! Bam!
