 Man : Carroll was convicted in 2004 for the murders of 14 young women. 
 FBI Director : We need you in Virginia, Ryan. 
 I'm not an agent anymore. 
 You caught Carroll. No one knows him like you do. 
 So what's my sequel about, Joe? 
 Carroll : We're gonna write this together, Ryan... 
 Aah! 
 Even though you slept with my wife. 
 I have so many surprises waiting for you. 
 Cults, my specialty. 
 Ryan : Gay neighbors, the nanny, how do they figure into your new plot? 
 Why is my dad such a bad man? 
 Maybe he's not so bad. 
 And where are you going, huh? 
 You're a liar. 
 What the hell? 
 Hey, guys. This is Megan. 
 Joey : I've never killed anything before. 
 We're just getting started. 
 They're teaching him. 
 Why did your husband try to kill you? 
 Rick can be scary when he wants to be. 
 So who has Joey? 
 I don't know where the kid is. 
 Does Rick know where Joey is? 
 I don't know, but his wife does. 
 What? 
 Maggie. 
 Parker : Maggie Kester is one of them. 
 How you doing? 
 You sleep well all right? 
 Jacob : What are we gonna do, Paul? 
 You really screwed up here. 
 I think we've all made mistakes, Jacob. 
 Mistakes are important. It's how we learn. 
 But you have gone off the deep end. 
 Emma : That is an understatement. 
 Megan, you remember Emma. 
 Look. She's not very friendly. 
 Just don't take it personally. 
 I thought you were gonna deal with this. 
 That's funny. When has he ever dealt with anything? 
 Will you stop it? 
 Who is she? Where did she come from? 
 We met in a little grocery store one town over. 
 You fool. This is going to get us caught. 
 Girls go missing all the time. 
 Was there a surveillance camera in the store? 
 No. You didn't think about that. 
 You will be identified. 
 It's a matter of time. 
 We're wanted in 50 states, Emma. 
 Who cares? They won't find this farm. 
 We're in the middle of nowhere. 
 Emma's right. This is not cool. 
 Wow, Jacob. Thanks for pointing out an uncool situation. 
 That helps. 
 Heh. Told you. 
 First things first. We can't have Joey see her, so get rid of her. 
 Kill her and bury her out behind that stable or barn, whatever the hell that is. 
 Ah. Sounds like a plan. 
 Jacob, you kill Megan, and I'll make breakfast. 
 I'm thinking pancakes. 
 Megan, do you like pancakes? 
 Sorry. You'll be dead. 
 Joey : Denise, where are you? 
 Damn it. Just do it. 
 What are you doing, Paul? 
 No, Jacob. What are you doing? 
 And just how long do you think you're gonna get away with it? 
 Because I for one am tired of all the lies. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Jacob on video : Wow! Say bye-bye. 
 They got hardwood, barn, fences-- farmhouse. 
 Have you got it? 
 Weston : I'm analyzing it now. 
 Those are northern red oak trees and tall fescues grass in the yard. 
 Put us on the East Coast. 
 I'm trying to pull a number from the telephone pole. 
 Parker : What about the e-mail the video was sent from? 
 Uh, an open IP address courtesy of North Korea. 
 They're changing the routing again. 
 They're watching the news. 
 They know we got Rick and his cell phone. 
 How are you doing? 
 I'm good. All good here. 
 Keep me posted. 
 This is-- it's helpful. 
 You know, they made this video for shock value. 
 Joe's playing with us. 
 It's like a game to him. 
 There's no concrete evidence to support psychopathic behavior is hereditary. 
 You think I don't know that. 
 I know my son's not a psychopath, but you put heroin in someone's arm long enough, they become a junkie. 
 These people are killers. Why can't you find him? 
 We will. We are-- 
 That's what you keep saying. That's what you keep saying, that's what everyone keeps saying. 
 You're the FBI. If you can't find him, who can? 
 Claire. Claire. 
 [Buzzer] 
 How did Jordy kill himself? 
 He choked. Pried the bandage loose with his mouth and ate it. 
 Are you certain that Maggie knows where Joey is? 
 He said Emma and Maggie were behind setting up the house and she would know where they have Joey. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Okay. Oh! All right. 
 Not that way, not that way. Straight. 
 I am going straight. 
 No, no, no. I know that it seems that way, but-- 
 You-- you don't have to help me walk. 
 I know how to walk. 
 Well done. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, my God. 
 What am I gonna do with you? 
 I'm sorry. I drank too much. 
 [Groans] 
 [Cell phone ringing] You gonna take that? 
 No. I want to talk to Joe about Maggie. 
 [Buzzer] 
 Ryan. 
 Hello, Joe. 
 How can I help you today? 
 I'm having a problem. 
 I just can't see the brilliance in all this. 
 I mean, if you're writing a book, where's the smarts? 
 Because so far, it just all seems like amateur hour. 
 You found these 3 unstable freaks. 
 You got Emma, Jacob, Paul, and you convince them that to kill is to love or live or whatever the hell it is you're preaching. 
 You get them to kidnap your own son, but it just seems beneath you to go after such easy targets. 
 I don't follow. 
 Well, they're obviously screwed up. 
 Rick Kester's running around wearing a Poe mask. 
 It just all seems so silly. 
 Yeah. I'll give you that one. 
 I was never a big fan of that idea, but I do appreciate his wife Maggie. 
 Maggie? 
 I find her most interesting, and they are so in love, and as you well know, I'm partial to a good love story. 
 Well, that love story's come to an end. 
 Are they dead? 
 Uh, Rick is. Yeah. I killed him myself. 
 Oh, I... I'm delighted to hear that. 
 You're getting your mojo back. 
 That's-- that's wonderful news. 
 I don't suppose Maggie was too pleased to hear that. 
 Why's that? 
 Oh. This is about Maggie. 
 You're on a fishing expedition. 
 Why didn't you say so? We could have cut to the chase. 
 Yes. Maggie-- Maggie is... 
 Oh. She is a very special girl. 
 How so? 
 Her real name is Margaret Schuller-- that's S-C-H-U-L-L-E-R. 
 Go get on that. 
 Carroll : She first visited me 8 years ago. 
 She'd written to me once or twice, and it turned out she'd been on this extraordinary killing spree in Arkansas and completely got away with it. 
 No. I find Maggie to be extremely resourceful, tenacious, and... impressive. 
 '02 to '05 in Little Rock, Arkansas, there were 6 murders, still unsolved, attributed to a female serial killer. 
 I remember this case. Victims were stabbed. 
 Mitchell : Little Rock Homicide sent a witness sketch it's on my screen. 
 They are not aware of Margaret Schuller. 
 If she visited Carroll in prison, she used an alias. 
 Emma : I need the phone. Where is it? 
 Did you see the news? 
 There's an APB on Maggie. 
 They can't find her. 
 Maggie : I'm not here. Leave a message. 
 She's not picking up. 
 Maggie, where are you? 
 Call me. I'm worried. 
 You know the secure line. Call it. 
 Something's wrong. She should have called. 
 Maybe she can't. 
 That's what I'm worried about. 
 Well, sounds like Rick screwed up. 
 Joey. 
 I'm coming! 
 I'll be right out. 
 Okay. 
 What's happening in the basement? 
 Ask your boyfriend. He's taking care of it. 
 Well, if he can. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 Emma, I lived with the guy for 3 years. 
 That's a long time to get to know someone. 
 Is that about you two getting your gay on? 
 Look. I don't care how much you fooled around. 
 I'm not stupid. 
 I know there's a reason you were playing the jealous, little bitch, but whatever happened, don't fool yourself. 
 Jacob's not gay. 
 Try again. You're way off. 
 This is about Jacob and his lies. 
 He's lied to you and me and Joe and everyone else. 
 About what? 
 Jacob's never killed anyone... ever. 
 You didn't know that, did you? 
 God, I wish you could see your face right now. 
 Weston : This is from a hardware store off I-95 in Trenton, New Jersey. 
 Now they chat, something's funny, they laugh, and then... 
 What did she buy at the hardware store? 
 Cash purchase, cord rope, tape, flashlight, and several magnets, neo base magnets. 
 Parker : Magnets? That chick's weird. 
 If Joey was upstate, then I-95 would be the route that you would take. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Weston : Well, forensics said New York or Connecticut. 
 You had a doctor's appointment this morning. 
 They called. They said that you missed your last checkup, too. 
 You're a drunk with a heart problem. 
 You have a pacemaker sewn into your chest to keep you alive, Ryan. 
 You don't have to take care of me. 
 I care about you, I do, but I am just being stupid now. 
 I mean, you've gotten a raw deal, but something has to give here. 
 Nothing changes if nothing changes. 
 What is that, a slogan from one of your little groups? 
 You know what? It hurts too much to be around you, so I'm done. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Sorry. I got to take this. 
 Hello, Jenny. 
 Jenny : Uh, Ryan. 
 What's up? Everything okay? 
 No. No, it's not. 
 Maggie : Hello, Ryan. It's Maggie Kester. 
 Remember me, the wife of the man you killed? 
 Maggie, where are you? 
 What are you doing with Jenny? 
 We're bonding. 
 Since you've been too busy to pick up the phone, I won't keep you. 
 I just have one question. 
 How do you want me to kill your sister? 
 What do you want? 
 I want you. 
 I'll trade you for your sister's life, but you come alone, unarmed. 
 If you bring any FBI near here, your sister dies. 
 Does Joe know what you're doing? 
 I've gone off book, Ryan. 
 That's what killing a husband will do to a girl. 
 Come alone. 
 Where are you? 
 Your sister promised to show me how to make a good risotto. 
 I'll save you some. Hurry. 
 You heard from Maggie? 
 No. 
 You getting worried? 
 I'm more worried about the girl in the basement. 
 What are we gonna do about her? 
 We can't let her go, and I don't want Joey to know about her. 
 Take care of it. 
 Well-- I mean, I really think Paul should do it. 
 He's the one that brought her here. 
 I think you should do it, Jacob... since you never have. 
 And I dragged her body from the car down to the water. 
 That was the first time that I realized how heavy bodies are when they're dead. 
 Floated her out to the water to just barely where-- where I could stand, and... 
 I stood on her for a good hour. 
 I wanted to make sure her body was completely weighted with water. 
 Then I drove home. 
 Who's next? Ha ha ha! 
 You told that story about the girl in high school. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I love you, and I was ashamed. 
 I mean, I was the only one who hadn't-- 
 Why be a part of this? 
 Because I want to. 
 I want to be a part of this. 
 I tried. 
 It's time to do more than try. 
 Do it. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's personal. Be back as soon as I can. 
 You're lying. 
 Tell me the truth. 
 I have a personal matter that I need to attend to. 
 I will be back. 
 Uh, where's he going? 
 I don't know. Go find out. 
 You put me in the role of snitch before. 
 I didn't like it. 
 He just took a call, and now he's out of here. 
 Something's up. 
 Well, who called him? 
 Someone named Jenny. 
 Where you going so fast? 
 Parker tell you to follow me? 
 Yeah, and I got to say I'm starting to feel used. 
 She thinks we bonded, but we both know you don't bond. 
 So you going to Brooklyn? 
 Why would I be going to Brooklyn? 
 That's where your sister lives. 
 Jenny Orson, 38, divorced, runs a restaurant in Williamsburg. 
 Is that where Maggie is? 
 Does Parker know where I'm going? 
 Did Maggie threaten your sister? 
 Maggie has Jenny. 
 She wants revenge for her husband. 
 Everything Joe told us checks out. 
 She's a wanted serial killer. 
 You can't go on your own. 
 It's my sister. 
 So let me go with you. 
 Please. 
 I didn't tell Parker about Jenny. 
 She doesn't know anything. 
 You'll be fired. 
 Actually, I think I'm traumatized from the loss of a fellow agent. 
 I'm not thinking clearly. 
 Probably get off with a warning. 
 Okay. 
 My name is Mike, sir. 
 You keep calling me Weston. 
 That's my last name. My first name is Mike. 
 So your sister Jenny-- you two close? 
 It's complicated. 
 Copy that. I got 3 brothers. 
 Close with one, hate the other two. 
 No? 
 Nothing? No conversation at all? 
 It's a long way to Brooklyn, that's all. 
 I'm glad you came. 
 And surprised. 
 Yeah, I am surprised. 
 Me, too. 
 But I'm more glad. 
 Me too. 
 
 
 
 Woman : ♪ spent a lifetime ♪ 
♪ feeling incomplete... ♪ 
 Then they get mad. 
 No. 
 There she is. 
 Jenny : Hey. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
 Hi. 
 How you doing? Hi. 
 Claire, this is Jenny, my sister. 
 Jenny, Claire. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. I love your restaurant. 
 Oh, it's yours. Take it. 
 Take the mortgage, take it all. 
 Oh. 
 So do we get menus or-- 
 No, no, no, no. This is a special occasion, so I have a whole menu prepared. 
 Um, I hope you like salmon. Say yes. 
 I love salmon. 
 She's winning me over. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 It's Parker. 
 [Ringing] 
 [Ringing stops] 
 So what's the plan? 
 My sister's restaurant is a few blocks up. 
 It's closed. 
 I'm gonna do whatever Maggie says. 
 The moment I know my sister is safe, I don't care after that. 
 I think you need a better plan. Take my gun. 
 No. She said to come unarmed. 
 Are you a good shot? 
 I'm an overachiever, sir. 
 All right. There's a kitchen door, side alley. 
 I'm gonna leave it unlocked. 
 Something happens, you don't worry about me. 
 You make it all about Jenny. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Maggie : Hello, Ryan. 
 I'm here, Maggie. Where's my sister? 
 She's here. 
 Don't do that, or she dies. 
 Okay, okay. 
 You got me. 
 Just let her go. 
 I intend to. 
 I've grown fond of your sister. 
 She loves you very much, and I've enjoyed getting to know all about Ryan Hardy, the early years. 
 It's a very sad story. 
 Where is she? 
 Jenny? 
 Jenny! 
 Jenny! 
 Jenny : Ryan! 
 Don't scream, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Jacob, right? 
 No talking. 
 I'll be quiet. 
 I just want to say one thing. 
 If you let me go, I won't say anything to anyone. 
 Of course you won't. 
 I know you don't want to hurt me. 
 Look. I have an idea. 
 You can cut me a little bit on my arms and my legs, and I'll bleed a lot, all over the place, and then you can tell your friends you killed me. 
 Then you can say that you took me out to the woods and dumped me in the ravine. 
 They won't believe that. 
 We'll make them believe it, and then I'll go home, and I won't tell anyone, not a soul. 
 Please. 
 Let me go. 
 I don't want to die. 
 What's wrong, Jacob? 
 I don't want to disappoint you. 
 Hmm. 
 I tried. 
 I-- I can't do... it. 
 Oh. 
 Do the others know? 
 I lied. 
 I know that I shouldn't have. 
 Jacob. 
 Do you want to be part of us? 
 Very much so. 
 I don't want to go back to my old life. 
 I can't. 
 "Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing"... 
 "Dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before." 
 It's okay. 
 No one need know. 
 It will be our secret. 
 But I want to. 
 I know, and one day, you will but when you are ready. Hmm? 
 Megan : Please! 
 Shut up! 
 Shut... up. 
 Come on. Wake up. 
 That's it. 
 Easy. You don't want to tip. 
 That could hurt. 
 Jenny. Did she hurt you? 
 No, I didn't. 
 We were waiting for you, right, Jenny? 
 Jenny. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 I don't know about Jenny here. 
 You promised me. 
 I'm not gonna kill her... but the psychological damage of watching her brother die is bound to leave a few scars. 
 Just tell me what to do. 
 Just please tell me what to do. 
 Granted, it should be Claire who witnesses your last breath, but, well, she's locked up tighter than Joe Carroll. 
 Yeah. Claire would have been a more appropriate choice, but, oh, well. Pain is pain. 
 You know, I really enjoyed meeting your sister today. 
 Good. I'm glad. 
 I feel like I got a little more insight into the... mystery that is Ryan Hardy. 
 Not much, just a sliver. 
 A sliver, huh? 
 Yeah. Just a sliver. 
 So I just gave you a really good in to open up and talk to me, and you didn't take it. 
 [Grunts] 
 Come on, Ryan. Just talk to me. 
 It's kind of a downer. 
 I don't care. 
 Yeah. All right. You asked for it. 
 Uh, my mom got sick when I was a kid, leukemia, and she fought it for years, but it got her. 
 She died when I was 14. 
 Ryan, I-- 
 My dad, uh, was a street cop, Albany PD, his entire life until he retired, and one night, he walked into the wrong corner store at the wrong time and tried to be a hero and-- 
 Ryan, I'm-- I'm so sorry. 
 So it's just you and Jenny then? 
 We had a older brother-- Ray. 
 New York fireman. 
 Oh, Go-- if you say, "9/11"-- 
 Okay. I won't say it. 
 Told you it was a downer. 
 You and death go way back. 
 Hmm. 
 A lot further than Joe. 
 [Groaning] 
 Go! 
 Get out of here. 
 Go! 
 Woman on TV : Now to Virginia, where authorities are trying to end a recent murder spree that looks to be the work of a secret cult loyal to serial killer Joe Carroll. 
 Several people are dead, and Carroll's son Joey Matthews... 
 It's the girl! She's getting away! 
 You go that way. 
 I'll go around the back. 
 Emma : Paul! 
 Unh! 
 Relax. It's only a flesh wound. 
 Aah! 
 [Sobbing] 
 One of my foster dads, he had a pacemaker just like yours. 
 Oh. I read your book. 
 I know how bad off your heart is. 
 You really need it. 
 Did you know electromagnetic fields can interrupt the function of a pacemaker? 
 No! No! No! 
 Shh! 
 All you have to do is watch. You have the easy part, Jenny, but your brother, he is probably starting to feel... 
 Maggie. 
 A little woozy. 
 Let her go. 
 [Whimpers] 
 Please. Please don't-- please don't do that to Jenny. 
 You can kill me, but please let her go. 
 Do you really think she's gonna walk out of here? 
 There's too many knives in this place for that. 
 No. No, no, no, no. 
 We're off book, remember? 
 It's improv night. 
 Joe doesn't want you to kill me. 
 That's the beauty of it. 
 I'm not killing you. Joe is. 
 He's the one who stabbed your heart. 
 I'm just shutting down your heart gizmo so that Joe actually does kill you. 
 I think it's perfect. 
 Jenny, you watching? 
 How cursed your family is? 
 This... is for Rick. 
 We loved each other. 
 Do you even understand love, Ryan, real love? 
 Oh. Your fingers are blue. 
 Your blood's not circulating. 
 It hurts, doesn't it? 
 No! No! 
 No! No! 
 It will be soon now. 
 You don't want to miss the end. 
 Let's get closer so you can see his last breath. 
 Stop! 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Heartbeat] 
 Okay. Hey! Hey. Come on. 
 You okay? Come on. Wake up. 
 All right. Okay. 
 Sorry. I didn't hear anyone. 
 I was just cleaning up. Ahem. 
 Yeah. Same here. 
 She really found the mud, didn't she? 
 Heh. 
 Man : ♪ and it's going down ♪

 [Echoing] 
 Man : Your pacing is normal. 
 Once you remove the interference, it diverts back to its normal function. 
 That's good to know. 
 Make an appointment with your cardiologist. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. You? 
 Maggie Kester's cell phone. 
 It was on her. I got calls, e-mails. 
 I thought it was on a secure server. 
 Yeah, but if there's a bump or delay on an incoming and an outgoing, I can pull a location. 
 Does Parker know? 
 Oh, yeah. She still chewed my ass out. 
 I'll get suspended over this. 
 We should go. I got to get back. 
 Yeah, Mike. Just... give me one minute, okay? 
 I'll be right with you. 
 Do you think you could disappear for a while? 
 Because I think it would be a good idea. 
 Yeah. Uh, Miami's called once or twice. 
 Maybe a visit's in order. 
 Okay. 
 How's Claire? 
 So what happened? 
 Told her I needed time. 
 We were never gonna work. You said so yourself. 
 Until I saw you guys. 
 I mean, it's weird, the situation, but I saw you guys. I was wrong. 
 You love her. 
 I'm well aware of that, Jen. 
 So... you break up with her in some gesture of nobility? 
 Claire and her son need to move forward. 
 As long as I'm there, I am always going to be a part of Joe Carroll, and she needs a new start. 
 She deserves that. 
 What do you deserve? 
 She's hanging in there. 
 You know, that... woman tonight was right about us, our family-- cursed somehow, surrounded by death and... 
 I know that you're afraid to let anyone get close to you. 
 It's who we are, but we can't go through life alone. 
 It's no life. 
 [Shower running] Emma? 
 I'm sorry about... 
 We're not giving up on you. 
 When will you know? 
 Let me know as soon as you hear. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey. 
 That woman I went after, we got her cell phone. 
 They were able to find a signal in upstate New York, Dutchess County. 
 I'm glad your sister's okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Cyberteam thinks they're gonna have an address, two hours at the most. 
 This is a break, Claire. 
 We're gonna find Joey. 
 I know you will. 
 I-- I should go. 
 No. You-- you need to-- you need to rest. 
 You need something to eat. 
 I can-- I can make you something. 
 What do you deserve? 
 I'm not ready. 
 Life doesn't wait for you to get ready. 
 You got to jump in. 
 Claire's not ready. She's been through too much. 
 She has a kid. 
 I can make you breakfast. 
 It's no trouble. Just... 
 Just-- just until they call. 
 Jenny : We're not talking about Claire. 
 I am no good for her or for her son. 
 I am a constant reminder of the worst time in her life, and she doesn't deserve that. 
 But you love her. 
 Because I love her. 
 Ryan, stay, please. 
 I really need to get back. 
 I'm gonna call you as soon as I know anything.
