 The following takes place between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. 
 Events occur in real time. ♪ ♪ (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MAN GRUNTS) (LINE RINGING) It's your brother. ♪ ♪ (WATER RUNNING NEARBY) (SHOWER RUNNING) Hey. Hey, babe How was work? It was good. I escorted some CEO to the airport. I helped another one's wife get home safe from some charity event, you know, just helping the one percent breathe easier. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Fix you breakfast? Just coffee, thank you. Mm-hmm. (CHUCKLES) I thought you stopped taking these. I did. For a couple of weeks. So... what's going on? I mean, you said you were ready. I know. Listen, it's been six months, Nicole. And I get it hasn't been easy living in the hiding, changing your name and... Eric, I'm fine. Okay? I'm just... (CHUCKLES) I'm just worried you're not. You're barely eating or sleeping. I hear you outside punching that bag at all hours. What do you want from me? Seriously, what... just tell me, what do you want me to say? I just, I think you still need more time. You got to get past everything that happened to you over there. I'm okay. Are you? Things are good. They're good. Right? We got a future here, so we should start acting like it, okay? Hmm. Hmm? Let me get coffee. Okay. And pull hard copies of everything we put together on the Haddads, including ground recon going back six months. Be advised... Thanks, Andy. I'm already late. My husband's gonna kill me. She's cutting it close. Maybe I should call. She'll be here. (APPLAUSE IN THE DISTANCE) I just sent you some changes for the fund-raiser speech. Uh, let me know what you think. Yeah, will do. We're gonna have a lot of eyeballs on it. There she is. I was beginning to think this was gonna happen without you. You look beautiful. You're just saying that. I may be a senator, but, uh, I would never lie to you. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Rebecca : Sorry I'm late, I was pulling case files, and lost track of time. Case files? I have another transition meeting with Mullins. I thought you were done with those. We didn't get through everything last time. So... I'm gonna have to go directly to the fund-raiser from CTU. Don't worry. I won't be late. Woman : They're ready for us. I know how important this is. Oh, did the Haliwells confirm? We're still waiting to hear. Just right here. Thank you. I'll reach out. Man : Senator, over here? People with that kind of money tend to move in herds. Thank you. But we'll need them to get to the White House. Not that this will hurt. You're gonna make a great first lady. Come on. No. I want this to be your moment. Go ahead. Love you. (APPLAUSE) Good afternoon. Six months ago, U.S. Special Forces launched an assault on the compound of Ibrahim Bin-Khalid, killing him and eight members of his terrorist organization. It is my distinct privilege to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the woman whose tireless efforts made that victory possible. Former National Director of CTU, Rebecca Ingram. (APPLAUSE) (WHISTLES) (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) ♪ ♪ Thank you. Thank you, Senator. This is such an honor and so humbling. I'd like to acknowledge the many dedicated people at CTU, whose hard work made this operation a success. And the Army Rangers, six heroes who risked their lives to stop Bin-Khalid from carrying out his threat to attack this country. You know, my boss said he'd let us use his cabin up in River Woods. Maybe we should go up this weekend. Take some time for ourselves, you know? Or we could do that right now. (LAUGHS) Eric, I have to be at work in an hour. You can call in sick. No. I can't. Yes, you can. I just got this job. So? (LAUGHING): I'm not trying to lose it. Yeah, so? Huh? Mmm. Just call in sick. (PHONE RINGING) Mmm. Mmm. (CARTER GROANS) (CARTER SIGHS) (EXHALES) Yeah? Government screwed us again, Eric. Ben, what are you talking about? Supposed to keep us safe? Bin-Khalid's people found us. Whoa, Ben, Ben, slow down and tell me what's going on. Two men showed up where I was crashing. They asked if anyone had seen me. That could mean anything. They were showing around a picture of me in uniform. They know who I am. Are you sure? I'm not making this up. Those guys, they tore the place apart. You got to call CTU. You got to get them on this before these bastards find me. Ben, I need you to calm down, okay? Don't tell me to calm down! This is happening. Get somewhere safe and I'll deal with this. Tell me how I can reach you. You can't. Ben... What is it now? He said Bin-Khalid's people found him. What else is new? What are you doing? I'm signaling the squad. How? I thought... you weren't supposed to have any contact with each other, that you just made an exception for Ben. We don't have contact. The Army, they set this up. It's a double-blind alert. So, you're actually taking Ben seriously? Just being safe. The guys will signal back that they're okay, and I'll find Ben and I'll get him cleaned up. Eric, how many times are you gonna send him to rehab? You're not his squad leader anymore. What is it? They're not responding. You just sent it out. They just have to tap the screen to confirm. Maybe they're not near their phones. All of them? Nicole. Get to the attic. Go. What is it? Get to the attic. Go! Go! What is it? Eric, what is it? They're jamming us. I'm going for the gun. No matter what you hear, no matter what happens, you stay there, okay? Don't make a sound. Don't move! (GRUNTS) Search the house. (CLOCK BEEPING) (CLOCK BEEPING) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) I put the case files in the conference room. Great. And congratulations. Your speech was great. We watched it on C-SPAN. Thanks, Andy. Where's Bashir? Oh, Mullins let him go Friday. What? Yeah. Brought in someone new, who is so not as qualified. We're talking two-year college. I'm sure he had his reasons. I mean you were tough, honestly. Sometimes I wanted to bitch-slap you, but at least you had our backs. Keith? Rebecca, hey, congratulations. Oh, thank you. Part of me thought you'd cancel, be off celebrating. Mm-hmm. How's John? Oh, campaigning. 24/7. I don't know how he does it. Yeah. I've got to make a fund-raiser. We should get started. Yeah. I'm "so not qualified." Really? You know, for your information, not everyone needs to go to Stanford. Okay, that was a private conversation, okay? And-and how did you even know I went to Stanford? You told me two minutes after we met. You know my cousin was Edgar Stiles. And I should know who that is? He was one of the best analysts CTU ever had. Taught me more than you could have ever learned at Stanford. (GLASS SHATTERING, OBJECTS CRASHING) Where's your wife? She's at work. Her car's in the driveway. A friend of hers picked her up. I know why you're here, so just, just do what you have to do. I want the strongbox. What? Where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. A strongbox that belongs to Sheik Bin-Khalid, taken from his compound the night your squad came and killed him. I never saw anything like that. Your men... Stewart, Jackson, Geddes, Colburn... they didn't have it. That's right. We killed your friends and their wives and their children. (GRUNTING) That leaves you and Grimes. And you're going to tell me which one of you has it. Where is it?! (FADED): Where is the strongbox?! I don't know. I'm not convinced. Last chance. Where is it? (CRASH) Outside! (GRUNTS) Back inside. Someone is in the house. (PANEL BEEPS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Nicole, are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah. Listen. You did good, okay? You saved our lives, but we got to go. Come on, Nicole, we got to go. Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Come on. (ALARM CHIRPS) (CAR HORN HONKS) Rebecca : Okay, good, let's move on to the Haddad network. I'm up to speed on the Haddads. Sorry, I just need to make sure nothing's overlooked. Oh, understandable. But I'm on it. I noticed you made some personnel changes. Where I thought better choices were available. Better than Bashir? He's the expert on extremist social media. Rebecca... you're the one who chose me as your replacement. I mean, you need to trust me to do the job. You're right. Running CTU, it's like a drug... hard to come down from. So maybe you're just not ready to let go. The party asked John to run four years ago. He said no, because of me. He knew I couldn't track Bin-Khalid and work on his campaign at the same time. So... (CELL PHONE BUZZING) I promised once we got Bin-Khalid, it was his turn. I'd be there for him. Sorry, I need to take this. Uh, yeah, yeah, no worries. Just find me when you're done. Carter? We're blown. The whole squad. What? Bin-Khalid's people found us. They have our new names, and three of them just broke into our house. Listen, I took them out, but... they killed the rest of the squad. Grimes and I are the only ones left. (SIGHING): Oh, my God. Your-your wife, is-is-is she...? She's with me, but you need to know. This isn't payback. They're looking for a strongbox they say one of us stole from Bin-Khalid's compound. I don't know why and I don't know what's in it. Bin-Khalid was planning an attack on U.S. soil. Maybe this strongbox is-is part of that. A weapon or-or Intel on a target. Whatever it is, Ben must be the one who took it. Why? Why would he do that? The war really messed him up. I was covering for him at the end. Do you know where he is? No. No, he's paranoid. He-he started shooting up and he lives off the grid. I'll have Keith Mullins try to track him down. No. No, three people had access to our new names. The directors of CIA, NSA and CTU, which is now Keith Mullins. I've known Keith for years, I can't believe he'd give up the squad. But he did have access. Yes. Then it could be him. And I'm not gambling our lives on that. Listen, you need to help us find Ben. I don't know where he is, but I have the number that he called me from. It's probably a burner. Okay. I'll try to figure out some way to run a geospatial. All right. I'll send the number to you now. And then I need to get Nicole somewhere safe. I can't help you. And the police and FBI are on the same network that's been compromised. They're not an option. Call me when you find Ben and I'll-I'll recover the strongbox. Okay. Nicole? There may be an attack, baby. I need to do this. This is Rebecca's problem. Why does it need to be you? Because right now... I'm the only one I can trust. (PHONE RINGING) Woman : Ben? Where have you been? You know how may times I've called? We just got in. I forgot my phone. Amy, listen. There's people after me. They may come after you. Ben... It's not in my head, I swear. You-you need to go get Mom and get out of town. Get out of town and go where? I know people in Chicago. I'll meet you at the bus depot behind Union Station. Train leaves in an hour. Amy... I'm here. I-I know I haven't been easy to deal with, that I put you through a lot. (SIGHS) You and Mom are all that I have left. Please... please just do what I'm asking. Okay, Ben. (EXHALES) I'll see you there. He wants me to meet him at the bus depot behind Union Station. Thank you. (WOMAN CRYING): Oh, no. Man : Let's go. You promised you wouldn't hurt us.

 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Did you get my text? All nine of them, yes. Okay. You need to talk to me, Amira. I'm worried about you. Drew. You need to leave me alone now, okay? This isn't any easier for me, but please, just stop now. Okay, Amira. Amira, wait, wait. Drew, get out of my way. Wait. Please, get out of... Get off! Get off me. Wait. Wait. Man : That's enough. Drew, in here. Now. Give us a minute. I don't care how upset you are, you can never get physical. Never. Now, what's going on? It's between us. Not after what I just saw. Start talking. Drew. (SCOFFS) I-I think... I think Amira's gonna do something... Bad. Violent. Here at the school. Okay. What does that mean? Why would you say that? Because she's been texting this guy. I-I-I don't know his name, but it's all of this terrorist stuff. Terrorist stuff. What...? Yeah. About-about the struggle. About destroying the American oppressors and how Amira is going to prove herself. I-I know this is crazy, but I'm starting to think that's why she came here from Chechnya with her brother to do this. Do you understand how serious this is, what you're saying? Yeah. Yeah. That's why I've been trying to talk to her. What are you gonna do? The school has a policy about this kind of thing. I have to take it to the principal. Yeah, but Amira's gonna know that I said something. There's nothing I can do about that now. If you're right about her, someone needs to intervene. Take your seat. Hey. What? What's going on? There's been an attack against the Army Rangers who killed Bin-Khalid. I just confirmed four of them are dead. Their families, too. Andy, I need geospatial tracking on a burner phone. Independent and undetectable by anyone in CTU. Can you do that? Why undetectable? Does-does Mullins not know about this? Only director-level personnel had access to the squad's identities, including me and... Keith. Wait a minute. Are you saying...? Wh-what... what are you saying? I'm saying that it's possible that Keith gave up the Rangers. So we need to do this in secret. Okay. But what if you're wrong about this? I'm not. And what happened to those Rangers, it's just the start of something worse. There's some kind of attack coming. (SIGHS) Ready to dive back in? Actually, something just came up with John's campaign. Is there an office I can use for a little while? Yeah, take the conference room. Thanks, Keith. Sure. What are we doing here? Eric, what is this? I'm getting you safe. Hell, no, Eric. What is this?! Listen, listen, Nicole. I can't take you to the police, okay? I can't take you to the FBI, because Bin-Khalid's people are in the system. We left all this for a reason! This is the only thing that makes sense to me right now. Isaac's not on anyone's books. He's got guns, he's got men. He can protect you, Nicole. And he's still family. Nicole : You think because he's your brother, he's just gonna forget what happened? Eric, let's go. Let's go! Isaac. Looks like you had a rough morning. The hell are you doing here? I need your help. My help? Damn, boy, you got a pair on you. Some things I did in the service are coming back around, and there's people are trying to kill me. What's that got to do with me, though? These men are terrorists, Isaac, and they're gonna kill a lot of people. I have to try and stop them, but... First I need to make sure Nicole is safe, so I need you to protect her. Right, so go ask your government. I can't. Why not? 'Cause someone in the government's working with the terrorists. (SIGHS) See? I've been telling you your whole life you can only trust your own. Look at you. Look at you now. Just tell me, okay? Are you gonna take care of Nicole, or not, 'cause... Hold on, hold on. So you finna come here like this after you stole my girl and ran off to play boy scout. Fight for your country. After what it did to the old man. Did to us. See, what I should do is bury your ass right here and now. I get it, Isaac. I get it, okay? If I was in your shoes, I'd do the exact same thing. I'd feel the exact same way. If you're not gonna do it for me, do it for Nicole. So now you're going there. Isaac, please. Please. A'ight. No one can know where she is, okay? These people after me, they're serious. So am I. (PHONE RINGING) Carter. When Grimes called you, he was at Church and Newberry. We'll track him forward from there. All right, I got it. I'll head that way. I'll contact you as soon as we locate him. Yeah. Listen, Nicole. I know. You need to do this. Just be careful, Eric. Baby, I will. I will, okay? I will. I love you. Okay? Go. Go. Come on. (CLOCK BEEPING) (CLOCK BEEPING) ♪ ♪ Okay, I've tracked Grimes forward in time using archive satellite footage. I've just rerouted a metro area drone to his current location. And you're sure no one at CTU can detect we're doing this? Please. I wrote the countermeasure myself. ♪ ♪ All right, Grimes is getting on a bus. Rebecca : Can you I.D. the bus? Andy : Doing it. Adding drone coverage and generating a 4D environment. Carter. Yeah. Grimes just got on the number 13 bus, heading east towards Union Station. Okay, call me when you know more. Andy? Stay on him. Yeah, sure. (LINE RINGING) (PHONE RINGS) Hey, hon. We're headed over now. I got good news about the Haliwells. Listen, John. There's a situation at CTU, I can't make the fund-raiser. What? (SIGHS) I'm sorry. I know how important this is. Rebecca. Whatever's going on over there, it's not your job anymore. I promise as soon as I can explain, you'll understand. No. No. Uh, I want you to explain it now. I can't. Not over the phone. Okay. I'll, um, I'll figure this out on our end. I love you. I love you, too. She, uh, can't make it. John, we built the event around Rebecca getting the medal. The donors are coming to see her. Well, I guess I'm gonna have to be more charming than usual. They will get to meet her at another event. Look, I may be overstepping, but I have to ask. Is Rebecca having second thoughts about giving up her career? Maybe part of her doesn't want you to win and have everything change. You're right. You're overstepping. Let's just use the Boston speech, Nilaa, okay? Narrator (on video) : Meanwhile, though the chemical properties were unknown, chemists addressed the question of how to separate plutonium from uranium. In 1942, with limited quantities (PHONE BUZZES) of plutonium available to the laboratory, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a lanthanum fluoride process for separating... (DOOR SQUEAKING) (VIDEO CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) ♪ ♪ (QUIETLY): I got your text. What's going on? Drew saw our messages. What?! He thinks you're planning an attack at the school with someone. He doesn't know it's with me. So what did you tell him? I told him... (INDISTINCT CHATTER) not to do anything till I talked to the principal, to buy us some time. Okay. I'll tell him I need to speak to him alone. Try and talk him out of it. Your brother's gonna want us to do more than that. Well, I'm not going to tell him. What are you going to do if you can't talk Drew out of it? Then we will do what we need to do. (EXHALES) David... David, everything's going to be okay. We're in this together. (INDISTINCT CHATTER, MUSIC PLAYING) You a'ight? Need anything? Nothing you've got here, Isaac. I meant something to eat. Whatever. Okay... I'm sorry. I appreciate you taking me in. Even though you look like it's the last place you want to be? It's not that. Then what? Trust me, you don't want to hear about it. 'Cause it's about you and Eric. Look, I've been over you a long time. A'ight? I think I can handle it. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) Eric hasn't been right ever since he got back. And at first, I thought it was because of everything he'd been through out there, that it was PTSD or something, but... After seeing him kill those two men today... I realized it's not PTSD. He misses it. He needs it. The life he says he wants with me, it'll never be enough for him. All I could tell you is this. Eric was fine here working for me, a'ight? He took off 'cause of you. I guess he wanted you to have something better. And that part I get. Royo's men called. Deal's on. A'ight. We'll call you later. You are unbelievable. She's my brother's wife. Like that would stop you starting up with her again. Don't get crazy, a'ight? Now, listen, don't be telling anybody she here. You understand? She under my protection, Aisha. Now, tell me you understand. I understand. All right. (PHONE RINGS) Carter :  Yeah, go ahead. Carter, Grimes just got off the bus, behind Union Station. Getting there. Just keep tracking him. Keeps looking around. He really is paranoid. Except he actually is being watched. Stay with him, Andy. Check it out, this is crazy. A Rebecca Ingram is in our system. Uh, how would you know that? She's using a countermeasure that's real grade school. "Grade school"? Yeah, I'm running my own sigma code that saw right through it. She's accessing Intel she doesn't have clearance for. Who's qualified now? Score one for Brooklyn College. I got to let Mullins know. Uh, hold on a second. Uh, there's got to be an explanation. She can tell it to Mullins. Did you hear all that?I  got to shut it down. Not until we lead Carter to Grimes. Where is he? Somewhere in the train yard. He's out of sight right now. Here comes Mullins. (PHONE RINGS) Carter, where are you? I just got to the train yard. Where's Ben? He's still on the move. But Keith Mullins  knows that I'm logged in... he's gonna shut me down whether he's the leak or not. You can't let that happen. Listen, if you don't get me to Grimes, Bin-Khalid's people will get whatever's in that strongbox... and God knows what'll happen. Rebecca? Rebecca! I just got a report you're on our system? It was an emergency. I needed to crunch polling data for John. "Polling data"? Analyzing public databases for an ad buy that needs to get to him right away. Please. My analyst says you're accessing metro-area satellites and drones. What are you doing? You running some kind of op? Keith... I'm shutting you down. Excuse me. Rebecca, what is this? (ZAPPING) (GRUNTING) Yeah? Carter? Grimes just entered a maintenance shed 50 yards southeast of your position. I got it. I'm moving in. (CLOCK BEEPING) (CLOCK BEEPING) There's no mistake? You're certain? We'll let you know when we have Grimes. My brother is dead. And Carter is missing. How far are we from the bus depot? Less than two minutes. (PANTING): Ben? Ben, it's Eric. I know you're here. What are you doing here? How'd you find me? Where is it? What? Where's what? The strongbox that you took the night of the raid. Where is it, Ben? What are you talking about? Stop. Stop. The rest of the squad is dead, Ben. Their wives, their kids. What? Bin-Khalid's people killed them looking for it. What? Wh-Why? It's money. Some jewelry. It was Bin-Khalid's stash. So you thought it belonged to you, huh?! You know, what this war did to me, Eric! I was owed. I know, Ben! Listen. I know that this country let you down, but there is something inside that box, and they're after us... so where is it? Where is it? It's in my backpack. Hey... What...? What is that? What is it? What? It's a list. (PANTING): Names, numbers. Activation codes. These are sleeper cells. People Bin-Khalid recruited. Huh? A lot of them, living here. These codes go out, they launch attacks all over the country. Who-who are you calling? Ingram. They're here. They're here. What? Come on! I was gonna meet her! Let's go! (GUNFIRE) Let's go! Let's go! (BULLETS RICOCHETING) (BULLETS RICOCHETING) (GUNSHOTS) Get out of the way! Go! Go! Go!

If the government wants this list, they're gonna have to pay up. What? You heard me. Ben, listen to me. Just bring back the list before Bin-Khalid's people find you. (SIREN WAILING) Yeah, Maybe I'll find them. Huh? See what they're willing to pay. No, Ben. Ben, you won't do that. Okay? You wouldn't do that. I'll do what I have to. I meant what I said, Eric. I'm owed. Ben! I'm your friend, and I've always looked out for you, so please don't do this. Ben?

We checked it out. There are photos. This doesn't make sense. You will not win in November. The money is at the police station. How do you expect to get into the station? In the back of a patrol car. Here's the deal, you're gonna do what I say, when I say it. (HELICOPTER, BEEP) You need to get out of there, now! (GUNSHOT) The 24 : Legacy continues tomorrow at 8/7c on Fox.
