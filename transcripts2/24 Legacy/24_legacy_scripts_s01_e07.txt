 Mullins knows I helped Carter. He took away my clearance, and he'll fire me as soon as he figures out how. 
 I shouldn't have gotten involved. 
 Some might consider what I did an act of courage. 
 Courage? 
 Something you could've used a little bit more of. 
 Look, I'm gonna send CTU to pick you up. 
 Thank you. 
 For what? Saving my life. 
 Nicole! 
 Isaac. 
 We have her. 
 And we took the brother as well. 
 You told John you gave the identities of the Army Rangers to Jadalla Bin-Khalid. 
 I know he's told you some story about my working with terrorists, but... 
 I swear to you, I don't have the least clue what he's talking about. 
 I'm asking you one last time, help them find these terrorists. 
 I can't tell 'em something I don't know anything about. 
 911 call from Mikail Dudayev, father of Amira and Khasan. Daughter's driving a truck full of explosives onto the George Washington Bridge. 
 What's the status of the driver? 
 I think she's dead. No! 
 How many? 
 At least a hundred. 
 I just keep thinking, if I hadn't left CTU when I did... 
 Rebecca, that wouldn't have made any difference. 
 I could've done more. 
 They're still out there. 
 Okay, either we give up or we hunt them down. 
 This is the work of one cell. 
 There are 14 more cells, and they must strike as one. 
 But without the flash drive... 
 Carter will deliver the solution. 
 He'll do whatever we ask. 
 The flash drive we got from Grimes is damaged. 
 We need someone to recover the data. 
 You let my wife go and then we'll talk. 
 Find someone who can and bring them to us. 
 I'll free your wife and your brother when you do what I ask.

 Some kind of explosion, possibly a bomb, has destroyed a section of the George Washington Bridge. 
 We can't confirm that this was a terrorist act, but the bridges and tunnels to New York City have been closed. 
 First responders from both New Jersey and New York are working to get survivors off the bridge. 
 But we don't know how many lives were lost. 
 We'll bring you more information as it comes in. 
 Eyewitnesses who saw the explosion say that it was some sort of truck or car bomb... 
 Where are we on those lockdown protocols? 
 New York City is shut down. 
 Planes on the ground and trains in the station. 
 National Guard is mobilizing, and Homeland Security raised the alert level to red. 
 All those people... 
 Just stay focused. 
 We'll get through this together. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Director Mullins. Not now, Andy. 
 Sir, I understand why you benched me. 
 But with everything that's happened, can't you restore my clearance? 
 Please, I can help. 
 You can help by archiving those servers. 
 This is Andy. 
 Mr. Shalowitz, are you the owner of a blue teal Ford? 
 I wouldn't exactly call it teal. 
 Your alarm's going off. 
 You need to come down here and turn it off. 
 I'll be right down. 
 Eyewitnesses who saw the explosion say that it was... 
 Keith, this wouldn't have happened if Henry Donovan hadn't given the Rangers' IDs to the terrorists. 
 We both know conventional methods won't get him to talk. 
 We need to use enhanced interrogation. 
 My people are already in position to pick up Henry and take him to a black site. 
 I want your approval to activate them. 
 To recap, some kind of explosion, possibly a bomb, has destroyed a section of the George Washington Bridge. 
 Make the call. 
 I'll release Henry from CTU. 
 Keith. 
 Yeah. 
 My husband will never go along with this. 
 Okay, what do you suggest we do? 
 Stall him. Keep him from finding out what we're doing for as long as you can. 
 I can park him in the debrief, but it's a matter of time till he figures it out. I know. 
 I'll deal with that when it happens. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 ...to see clearly the extent of damage to the bridge. 
 Officials at this point believe that some type of bomb went off... 
 Rebecca. 
 You have approval to move on Henry. 
 I figured. I saw the bridge. 
 You okay? 
 No. 
 But I'll feel better when we get Jadalla. 
 How soon can you mobilize? 
 We're good to go. 
 Just let me know when he's being released. 
 I'll text you my location once I have him. 
 What the hell? 
 Oh... 
 Oh! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Relax. Oh, my God. 
 Relax, Andy, listen. I need your help. 
 I don't think Jadalla can set off any more attacks. 
 Not yet. How do you know that? 
 He contacted me. 
 He said the flash drive containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged, and he needs somebody to repair it. 
 Why would he call you? 
 Because he... he has my wife. 
 And he has my brother. 
 Oh, my God. 
 And if I bring him somebody to repair the list, then he'll let them go. 
 Uh, wait a minute. You're... you're not actually asking me to repair the drive, are you? 
 I'm asking you to help me destroy it. 
 I'm gonna bring you to him. 
 We will tell him that you're gonna repair the drive, but instead, you're gonna erase it. 
 Erase it? 
 It's something that you can figure out, right, Andy? 
 Yeah, I mean, I... I could write a virus. 
 But... but wait a minute. 
 Let's just say I did this. 
 Once we destroyed all the data on that flash drive, Jadalla will know. 
 How do we get out of there alive? 
 Andy, uh... 
 I don't think we're gonna make it out. 
 O-Okay, uh, that's... that's kind of a big ask, don't you think? I-I mean, there's got to be another way. 
 There isn't. 
 And this is the only chance that we're gonna get. 
 If we don't do this, Jadalla is gonna get somebody else to repair that drive. 
 And then he's gonna launch the rest of the attacks. 
 And, Andy, God only knows what these other sleeper cells have planned. 
 I get it. Okay? 
 This is a suicide play, but we are doing this to save thousands of others. 
 There aren't that many people in this world who get a chance to make this kind of a difference. 
 I'm gonna need a couple things. 
 What? My laptop and my development kit. 
 It's a hard drive with pieces of code to write programs... you know what, it doesn't matter. 
 It's on my desk. 
 Look, Andy... you're really going upstairs to... to get your laptop, right? 
 You're not gonna tell CTU? 
 Believe me, if I were lying, you could tell. 
 Reports continue to come in on that huge explosion... 
 ...that has destroyed a significant part of the George Washington Bridge. 
 As of yet, we do not have confirmation... 
 Is this Jadalla? 
 We think it's one of his sleeper cells. 
 Tell me what I can do. 
 Anything you need, anything that might help. 
 Well, actually, Mullins wants to ask you a few more questions about your father. I've already told him everything. 
 Yeah, we need to go through it again. 
 We don't know what details might be helpful. 
 There's an agent waiting for you in the conference room. 
 Please, John. 
 I don't want to release you, Mr. Donovan, but your biometrics are clean and with no hard evidence against you... 
 Or maybe you wanted to avoid getting a call from my friends at the Pentagon. 
 It crossed my mind. 
 Ah. 
 Where's my son? 
 He'd being debriefed. He'll be done soon. 
 Henry? 
 I'm leaving CTU now. 
 I'll be at the house soon. 
 Is everything all right? What happened? 
 Big misunderstanding. 
 I'll tell you about it when I get there. 
 Henry's been released. 
 An agent will stall your husband in the debrief for as long as he can. 
 I should go. You still haven't told me who you're using for this job. 
 I'm trying to insulate you in case this goes sideways. 
 I appreciate it, but I want a name. 
 Tony Almeida. Almeida? 
 He's a criminal. 
 A lot of people are dead because of Tony Almeida. 
 There's nothing that ties him directly to CTU. 
 That's why he's right for this job. 
 I have to go. 
 To the best of our knowledge, that information... 
 ...still limited access from one or both sides... 
 What do you want? I'm busy. 
 I just need to tell you... 
 ...that I get it. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I am needy, Tom. And insecure. 
 Andy, this isn't the time. 
 No, it-it's never gonna be the right time. 
 But that's okay. 
 I only wish I'd shown you my better qualities. 
 'Cause, believe it or not, I do have some. 
 Andy. 
 I know there's a lot of emotion flying around with everything that's happened today. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 I just needed to get that off my chest. 
 I'm good now. 
 ...they will continue to keep us updated on the situation as they ascertain whether... 
 Hey. 
 Go! Go! Go! 
 All right, let's move. 
 Go! 
 Isaac. 
 Isaac, please. Please stop. 
 Why are you always so stubborn? Stop it. 
 If I don't get us free, this thing ends real bad, you understand? 
 They're not gonna hurt us, okay? 
 They need us. They need us to get to Eric. 
 And when they do, they ain't gonna need us no more. 
 Eric is gonna get us out of this, okay? 
 He'll try. 
 'Cause that's what he does. 
 You made the right choice. 
 You did. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 'Cause the next time they come up here could be the last time I see you. 
 Like, for a long time I blamed him. 
 Like, my brother stealing my girl. 
 But you're not a thing that can be stolen. 
 You are a woman and made a choice, and you chose him. 
 It's not his fault. 
 That's on me. 
 I lost you. 
 Okay. Now get your hands off. 
 Isaac. Don't touch her. 
 Stop it! 
 Don't! 
 Oh, my God, Isaac. 
 Yalla. 
 Yalla. 
 Your wound. She's a nurse. 
 Gently. 
 She's our guest. 
 You need stitches. 
 Bring whatever she needs. 
 What do you want? 
 Why are you holding us hostage? 
 I believe you know of my father. 
 Ibraham Bin-Khalid. 
 My husband's team killed him in Yemen. 
 Yes. 
 And my mujahideen killed them in return. 
 Didn't kill my husband, though. 
 You're gonna need to take your shirt off. 
 And... 
 ...there's been a major explosion on the George Washington Bridge heading into Manhattan, and we have reports of many fatalities... 
 Horrifying, isn't it? 
 But based on the images we have seen so far, we can speculate that the number of fatalities could easily be within the 100 range... 
 Of course it is. 
 It's disgusting. 
 But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong. 
 Oh, but he will, though. 
 He will, because he loves you. 
 And once he's done, I'll kill him. 
 You can try. 
 But you'd better not miss. 
 Because I promise you... he won't. 
 Damn it. 
 Is there a problem? 
 This isn't easy. 
 I-I have to make the virus undetectable. 
 If Jadalla and his men discover it before it finishes erasing the flash drive, we fail. 
 And then, we die. 
 Which seems... I don't know... Like a waste of a perfectly good virus. 
 Andy, you talk a lot when you're stressed. 
 Look, you'll figure it out. 
 I have faith in you, man. 
 That makes one of us. 
 Hands on the car, legs apart. 
 Tom, don't. Back up, Andy. 
 I said grab the car. 
 You got three seconds. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 You left CTU with your laptop and your development kit in the middle of a terrorist event. 
 That's not normal behavior. 
 Even for you. 
 So you followed me? 
 Tell me what you're doing. 
 We're taking out Jadalla Bin-Khalid. 
 Jadalla's flash drive is damaged. 
 He told me to bring someone who could fix it and he's... 
 He kidnapped my wife and my brother as leverage. 
 I'm going with Carter to Jadalla. 
 He thinks I'm gonna repair the flash drive, but I-I wrote a virus that'll destroy it. 
 Let's say you fry the flash drive. 
 Then what happens? 
 How do you get out of there? 
 W-We don't. 
 Look, we're open to a better plan. 
 I mean, I-I really don't want to die. 
 Can't let you do this. 
 Freeze! 
 You won't shoot me. 
 But I will. 
 Tie him up, Andy. 
 Sorry, Tom. 
 Andy... 
 ...finish writing the virus. 
 Rebecca? 
 It's good to see you. 
 Tony. 
 Um... how you holding up? 
 Getting through it. 
 Did everything go all right? 
 Yeah, it was a clean grab, no complications. 
 Good. 
 Make sure you run all the preliminary medical on him before you begin. 
 I don't want anything to go wrong. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Does, uh, John know this is happening? 
 No. 
 That's gonna be an awkward conversation. 
 You're up to speed with everything we need from Henry? 
 Yeah. 
 Then you should get started. 
 All right. 
 So when were you two together? 
 What are you talking about? 
 It was a long time ago... after my wife was killed. 
 She met Donovan, and that was that. 
 So this is why you're doing the job? 
 Look, Sidra, this is just about the money, all right? 
 Don't make it about something that it's not. 
 What is this? 
 What do you want? 
 Just the truth, Mr. Donovan. 
 That's why we're here. 
 The truth about what? 
 About an hour ago, Jadalla Bin-Khalid launched a massive terrorist attack on New York City. 
 And we know he's planning more. 
 We also know that you've been in contact with him. 
 And that you gave him the names of the Rangers who took out his father. 
 Now I need you to tell me exactly how you two communicated. 
 I have never been in communications with this... Jadalla person. 
 I went through all of this at CTU. 
 Well... this isn't CTU. 
 Who the hell are you people? 
 She's just gonna draw a little bit of blood and run a couple of tests. 
 But unless you come clean, we're going to inject you with a chemical that'll stimulate the nociceptors in your brain. 
 The first dose'll feel like... your skin is being burned away from your body. 
 And trust me, it only goes downhill from there. 
 
 
 
 But... you could put an end to all of this. 
 You just tell us what we need to know, and then we'll inject you with a reversing agent, and the pain will stop like somebody hit a switch. 
 You understand? 
 This is crazy. 
 My son is a U.S. senator! 
 Okay. 
 Explain to me again how you came to realize that your father had framed your campaign manager. 
 Asked and answered. You're wasting my time. 
 Senator, I understand that this is frustrating for you, but we do have just a little bit more ground to cover. 
 Hello. 
 John, it's your t�o. 
 Your old man called. 
 He said he was on his way back to the house. 
 What? CTU released him? 
 That's what it sounded like, but he should've been here by now. 
 The GPS on his phone and car have gone quiet, and I can't reach anyone on his security team. 
 How long ago did he call? 
 15, 20 minutes. 
 I'll call you back. 
 Senator, we haven't finished yet. 
 Unless I'm under arrest, you need to stand down from this door, sir. 
 Sir? Senator! 
 Andy, we need to go. 
 Program's still compiling. 
 Two more minutes. 
 Do you have what I need? 
 CTU's top programmer, Andy Shalowitz. 
 If anybody can fix the chip, he can. 
 How did you convince him? 
 Let's just say I didn't give him a choice. 
 I'm sending you GPS coordinates for the exchange. 
 I want to speak to my wife first. 
 You'll see her soon enough. 
 No. 
 I need proof that she's okay. 
 Speak. Eric? 
 Nicole. 
 Nicole, baby, are you okay? 
 Did they touch you? 
 No, I'm okay. 
 Listen, I'm gonna come get you out of there, okay, as soon as... 
 Eric, whatever it is they want you to do, don't do it. 
 If I suspect for a moment that you've brought CTU, your brother dies first. 
 You know who comes next. 
 Andy, you don't have to do this. 
 Andy? 
 Let me call CTU. They'll back you up. 
 I'm asking you... to find another way. 
 I don't want to lose you. 
 Jadalla just sent the GPS coordinates. 
 When CTU finds you, you better tell them to stay away. 
 Because I'm gonna free my wife and my brother, and we're gonna end this once and for all. 
 Andy, let's go. 
 I'll see you in another life. 
 Where she at? 
 Tell me where Nicole at. 
 Where's Nicole? 
 Isaac. Oh, God. 
 Isaac. 
 I was worried about you. 
 I'm all right. 
 You're okay? 
 Let me see. 
 Yeah. Come on, now. 
 You know my grandma hit harder than them dudes, man. 
 Come on. 
 Close it up. 
 All bridges leading into Manhattan are shut down and evacuated. 
 NYPD's working on closing down the tunnels. 
 Director Mullins. 
 We need to talk. 
 You've released my father? 
 The one person who might be able to lead you to Jadalla Bin-Khalid? 
 We determined we'd gotten everything we could out of him. 
 Why isn't he answering his phone? 
 I really couldn't say. 
 I also can't reach my wife; somehow, I don't think this is a coincidence. 
 I want to know what's going on. 
 Let's, uh, talk in my office. 
 Right here. 
 Now. 
 Senator, we are dealing with a major terrorist threat right now... 
 I serve in the senate, but I am a candidate for the president of the United States. 
 I can have the attorney general here in 20 minutes. 
 Do you want to have this conversation with him? 
 Keith. 
 We couldn't stall your husband. 
 He knows his father's missing. 
 And you had something to do with it. 
 And he's threatening to call the A.G. 
 Okay, I'll talk to him. 
 What are you gonna tell him? 
 The truth. 
 Where is he? 
 He's in my office. 
 Put him on the phone. 
 Okay. 
 It's Rebecca. 
 Rebecca, where are you? Where's my father? 
 He's here with me. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Your father wasn't responding to conventional interrogation. 
 We needed to try something else. 
 Something else? 
 We need to finish this conversation in person. 
 I'll have CTU bring you over. 
 Until then, nothing happens to my father. 
 John, nothing's gonna happen to your father until you and I talk. 
 They're for anxiety. 
 I used to take one every morning with my coffee. 
 I don't... I don't know why I ever quit. 
 You know, my first mission as a Ranger, we were... clearing an apartment block in Baghdad. 
 Eight Rangers and over a hundred apartments. 
 And we had to go door-to-door. 
 But knocking on that first door was the hardest. 
 What happened? 
 Old lady opened the door. 
 We checked her apartment. 
 Moved on. 
 Well, what does that have to do with this? 
 You just do the job, Andy. 
 Door by door... one step at a time. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm all right. 
 Here we go. 
 Where's Jadalla? 
 He's close. 
 These are just his scouts. Make sure we're alone. 
 Good thing we're alone. 
 All clear. 
 We're slowing down. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, if I'm about to go out, I'm-a just say what I got to say. 
 All right? 
 Nicole, I love you. 
 I always have. 
 Always will. 
 Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this. 
 Follow my lead. 
 Okay. 
 Mr. Carter. 
 And you must be Mr. Shalowitz. 
 Where's my wife? 
 Send the programmer to me. 
 No. 
 That's not the deal. 
 You need to release Nicole and Isaac right now. 
 Tell your men to lower their guns! 
 Look, you might not need me, but you damn sure need him! 
 Lower your weapons. 
 Stop. 
 Bring them out. 
 Eric. 
 Eric. Eric. 
 Eric. Baby. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I am now. 
 Okay. Listen, stay here. 
 My brother! 
 Now! 
 Eric, what the hell is going on? 
 Nicole, get in the car, babe. 
 Are you coming with us? 
 Please. 
 I need you to get in the car, now. 
 What's gonna happen to you, Eric? 
 Nicole. 
 Just tell me you have a way out of this. 
 I'm gonna finish this. 
 I promise. 
 Eric, what are you... 
 I love you. I'm waiting, Carter! 
 No. No, Eric. I'm sorry. 
 Nicole. No! 
 Get her to CTU. Isaac'll take care of you. 
 No! Eric! 
 Listen, you don't have to do this. 
 All right? You know I do, Isaac. 
 You know I do. 
 Isaac, wait, wait. 
 I'm sorry, man. 
 For everything that's happened between us. 
 Everything that I did. 
 Nah. 
 Wasn't your fault, a'ight? 
 Things happened the way they had to happen. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Just take care of her, man. 
 For me. 
 Go. Go. 
 Go, man. Go! 
 Carter... 
 Find Carter's wife and brother before they get too far. 
 And kill them.
