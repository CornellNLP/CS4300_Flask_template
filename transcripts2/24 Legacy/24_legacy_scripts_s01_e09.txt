 Jadalla Bin-Khalid took Carter's wife and Carter traded himself and Andy. 
 If we can track them, they'll lead us right to Jadalla. 
 Fix the flash drive. Recover the data on it. 
 I won't help you recover your files. 
 Andy Shalowitz on a suicide mission. 
 That's hard to believe. 
 Yeah, maybe he decided he had nothing left after you took a job he loved and lived for. 
 How did you and Jadalla Bin-Khalid communicate? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Okay. 
 Give him another dose. 
 I see that you were able to organize this really quick. 
 It's not like that, John. 
 I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore. 
 We have to go back. Try to help Eric. 
 Eric told me to take care of you, so that's what I'm doing. 
 They're gonna kill him. 
 I remember when you were all family. 
 When there wasn't anything you wouldn't do for each other. 
 Let's give these bitches some payback. 
 Naseri. 
 Be quiet. 
 You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did? I swear to God I'm gonna watch you die. I said shut up. 
 Isaac. 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 You need to get out of there now. 
 DoD is launching a surgical strike on your location. 
 Carter! This place is about to blow! 
 Everybody get the hell out of here! 
 Move! 
 SLAR and Lantern verify a direct hit. 
 Keep, keep pressure on it, Isaac. 
 I'm going back inside. 
 Where's Naseri? 
 Where is he?! 
 Asim Naseri is in the country. He was here. 
 Naseri? You know what he is and what he's capable of. 
 We can't let him get away. Where is he? 
 _ 
 _ 
 We're set. Let's move this wall. 
 All right. 
 It's not him. 
 Jadalla Bin-Khalid's on his way in here. 
 You need to put extra security around him. 
 I'll put calls into all available off-duty security personnel, add them to the roster as they arrive. 
 Great. Sir. 
 Yeah? Eric Carter's on the line for you. 
 Carter, go ahead. Naseri's not here. 
 Is there anything on your end? 
 We're re-scanning satellite to see if we can find him leaving, but the smoke from the missile's creating some blind spots. 
 I think he made a call about 20 minutes ago. 
 Maybe you can track him that way? 
 Yeah, we can page local cellular towers, try to isolate his signal. 
 Got it. 
 We found a cell call placed from that location in the time frame you gave us. 
 Is there a way to track the phone or the, the phone he called? 
 No, both are either powered down or running different SIM cards. 
 But whoever Naseri talked to was at 1176 Hill Road. 
 It's a neighborhood not far from you. 
 Who lives there? Still working on it. 
 Interagency networks have been overloaded since the bridge attack. 
 All right, I'm-a head there now. 
 Who is this guy Naseri? 
 Bin-Khalid's bodyguard. 
 Two years ago, when Carter and his team were hunting Bin-Khalid, they hired Naseri as a translator, before any of us knew who he was. 
 Naseri used them to get to their highest-value intel asset. 
 He killed the asset's family. 
 Decapitated his three children. 
 Carter found them. 
 We got the bleeding under control. 
 All right, thanks. Appreciate it. 
 Yo, Isaac. 
 I just want to say thank you, man. 
 For everything. 
 I'm your brother, man. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Listen, where's Nicole? 
 She with Omar. 
 Not too far. 
 Look, I need you to look out for her a little while longer. 
 Huh? 
 There's one last thing that I need to take care of. 
 What? 
 Somebody that I went up against over there. 
 He was a part of this, okay? 
 And now he's gone. 
 So it's unfinished business. 
 Listen, man, seems like you got some unfinished business over here that you should be dealing with first. 
 Isaac. Not right now. 
 What you tell Nicole? 
 I will call her as soon as I can. Nah, man. 
 See, you not finna leave me here to explain all that to her. Call her now. 
 She is not gonna understand, man. 
 She's not the only one. 
 What the hell do you want me to say to her? 
 Like, I just lost three of my men and got myself shot saving your ass. 
 And I love you for that. 
 I do. 
 I got to go, man. 
 Going after this man... 
 It has to be you? 
 Of course it does. 
 Hey, why am I even asking? 
 I'm almost finished recovering the list of sleeper cells. 
 We all owe you a lot, Andy. 
 I know. 
 I want you to run the takedown with Locke, coordinate with the regional law enforcement agencies. 
 I can't do anything until you restore my clearance. 
 Already done. 
 Welcome back. 
 He's got a concussion we'll need to monitor. 
 I'll let Director Mullins know. 
 Hey. 
 I was gonna call you. Um... 
 My wife decided to stay home, so I can't see you tonight. 
 We're sending you a link, Mr. Grant. 
 Open it. 
 Who is this? 
 Where's Jennifer? 
 What is this? 
 What do you want? 
 Jadalla Bin-Khalid. 
 What? Your girlfriend is wearing a vest lined with C-4 plastic explosives. 
 I'm going to tell you exactly what to do and when. 
 If you deviate from what I'm telling you to do... 
 Try to warn anyone... 
 You will force me to detonate the device. 
 Please don't do this. 
 Once we have Jadalla, she'll be released. 
 Just do what I tell you and your girlfriend will be fine. 
 Eric? 
 Nicole. 
 He's okay. 
 Thank God. 
 We lost Andre and Marcus, though. 
 Isaac, I'm sorry. 
 We won't be seeing no terrorist attacks on TV tomorrow. 
 Me and Eric took those bitches down. 
 That's good news. 
 But where's Eric? 
 Eric had some business to take care of. 
 He'll call you as soon as he can. 
 Is that what he told you to say? 
 Whatever it is that Eric was doing... he's still in the middle of it. 
 Nicole. 
 I want to go home. 
 Well, I'll take you. 
 You don't have to. 
 Come on. 
 Let me take you home. 
 Thank you. 
 Only thing is... 
 ...I don't know where you live. 
 Arlington. 
 Okay, nice. Um... 
 I just got to reach out to Andre's mom on the way. 
 Yeah. 
 She-she can't be hearing what happened from nobody else. 
 The house is leased to a woman named Jennifer Marshall. 
 34, unmarried, works for a Zurich-based software company called Teradyne. 
 Is there anything linking Marshall to Naseri? 
 Nothing. No connection to anyone on the watch list or the NCIC database. 
 I'll send her DMV profile as soon as it comes up. 
 Our location's plus or minus a hundred meters. It's possible Naseri was calling someone else near the house. 
 We'll find out soon enough. 
 I got eyes on the house now. 
 Jennifer Marshall's wired up. 
 The remote trigger is live. 
 You should get out of there. 
 Leaving now. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Stay very quiet. Move. Move. 
 What is your name? Now! It's Jennifer. Jennifer Marshall. 
 Secure the house. 
 Put your hands above your head. 
 Who are you? What do you want? 
 I'm with the Counter Terrorism Unit. 
 We're looking for Asim Naseri. 
 Who? Who? 
 This man. 
 He made a call to this house about an hour ago. 
 No, I-I've only spoken to my sister, I swear. 
 Did you see anyone out front? 
 Hmm? In a car, walking by? 
 No, but I don't think I would've noticed. 
 Sir? 
 Floor is clear. There's a door to the basement. 
 Cover her. 
 I'll check the basement. 
 Sir? 
 I got Carter on the line. Go ahead. 
 Jennifer Marshall's been strapped into a vest filled with ordnance. 
 And I think Naseri is watching her on some kind of a Web camera. 
 So, Naseri's using her as leverage. 
 Yeah, but she can't tell us anything until we defuse the vest. 
 I might be able to create a video loop. 
 Like what Andy did for you when you broke into the police station. 
 I'm looking at traffic coming out of the house. 
 It's got a firewalled router, but I should be able to get through it. 
 Tell me how long until a bomb tech gets here? 
 We can get someone there in 20 minutes. 
 That's too long. 
 Listen, I'm gonna send you a picture of the device. 
 There's not much light down there, but I think I got it. 
 Perfect. That'll work. 
 Have somebody look for matching schematics. 
 Carter, you're gonna defuse it? 
 I'm gonna try. 
 CTU confirmed. Jadalla's in custody, and they've secured the flash drive with the list of sleeper cells. 
 So it's over. 
 It looks that way. 
 Well, then it's time to give the party a heads-up that I'm suspending my campaign. 
 Can you see if you can get me in front of Frank tonight? 
 Will do. 
 I'm bringing my father home. 
 CTU released him? 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry I can't take your call right now, but leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
 John, please call me back. 
 He's not picking up. You surprised? 
 You tortured his father. 
 You did what you had to do. 
 I don't think he'll ever understand that. 
 No, he probably won't. 
 He lives in a different world. 
 He'll never understand the work that we do. 
 Sometimes I'm not sure I understand it. 
 We do these terrible things and tell ourselves it's for the greater good, but... 
 You have nothing to apologize for. 
 I should go back to CTU for my debrief. 
 All right, well, we'll break down here. 
 It'll be like we were never here. 
 Okay. 
 Rebecca? 
 I hope things work out between you and John. 
 Thanks. 
 I can manage. 
 I've asked Dr. Waring to, uh, stop by tonight to... 
 So he can, uh, take a look at you. 
 I don't blame you for what Rebecca did. 
 She's the one who had them pump me full of all those damned drugs. 
 That's one thing about Rebecca: she gets things done, no matter what it takes. 
 I suppose I shouldn't be mad at her, either. 
 My fault. 
 I put you both in impossible situations. 
 But it's all water under the bridge now. 
 Water under the bridge? 
 I never meant to compromise you, John. 
 I was defending you against your enemies, protecting your campaign. 
 Look how well that turned out. 
 Turned out fine in the end. 
 I covered my tracks, John. 
 So now, no matter what sort of allegations they make, you're the only one I ever told. 
 They won't find any evidence connecting me to those terrorists, which means you don't have to quit. 
 You can still be president. 
 And I know that you can bring Rebecca around. 
 I mean, if anybody understands that sometimes short-term compromises have to be made for the greater good... 
 You're serious. ...it's Rebecca. 
 She understands that sort of thing. 
 There were over a hundred innocent people that were killed on that bridge because of you. 
 And a hundred million people will be helped if you become president. 
 When you become president. 
 Are you even listening to yourself? 
 You're upset. I understand. 
 It's over, Dad. 
 No. 
 It's over. 
 No, no, it's not, no. 
 We have not come this far just so you can throw it away. No. 
 For the record, you are the one who threw it away. 
 Don't you turn your back on me. 
 Come back here so we can discuss this! John! 
 Who the hell you think you are, turning your back on me?! 
 I'm your father. 
 That was the party office. 
 The chairman can meet you after 11:00. 
 Good. 
 That's enough time to draft a statement. 
 But, um... 
 I don't want to do it here. 
 How's the roll-up going? 
 Fine, except we got a complication. 
 One of the terrorists slipped away, someone from your Bin-Khalid operation. 
 Naseri? Yeah. 
 Guy's got nine lives, and he's used only three so far. 
 Rebecca, before your debrief, I was hoping you could talk to Jadalla, see what you could find out. 
 Tim. Yes, sir. 
 Could you pull over, please? 
 I'm, uh... I'm gonna need a minute. 
 Thanks. 
 John. 
 I wasn't sure you'd call me back. 
 I wasn't sure, either. 
 You know, I just brought my father home, and I-I keep asking myself, was, was I oblivious all of these years? 
 Or was he always this-this insane? 
 He was desperate. 
 Not that I'm justifying what he did. 
 I'm-I'm not, but... 
 Desperation can make you do terrible things. 
 And it can make you keep them from the people you love because... 
 ...because you don't want them to see that part of you. 
 Rebecca, I may not know you like I thought I did, but I do know one thing. 
 I don't want to lose you. 
 I don't want to lose you, either. 
 Listen, I have a meeting... later on tonight with the party chairman about suspending my campaign. 
 If I do that, I... 
 I'd-I'd really like to talk to you. 
 You know, face-to-face. 
 Yeah. I don't know how long I'm going to be... 
 Could you come here? 
 Absolutely. 
 Okay. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Uh... 
 Would you mind very much taking the follow car, and I'll head on over to the chairman's office. 
 I-I... I'll meet you there. 
 _ 
 Stephen. 
 Ms. Ingram. 
 I-I didn't know you were back. 
 Keith asked me to interrogate Jadalla, see if we can get a lead on Naseri. 
 Stephen, are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 I just, uh... I'm fighting something. 
 Ms. Ingram? 
 Biometrics are in place whenever you're ready. 
 I'm Rebecca Ingram. 
 But you already know that. 
 As it stands, you're set to be transferred from here to a five-foot square cell in Guantanamo. 
 But tell me what I want to know, and I'll petition my government on your behalf. 
 Recommend that you're sent to a federal prison. 
 You'll live the rest of your life under much better conditions. 
 Have access to books. 
 Return to your studies if you want. 
 Asim Naseri escaped from the warehouse. 
 We want to know what operation he's running and how to find him. 
 I don't know anyone named Naseri. 
 Eric Carter saw him with you. 
 I don't know anyone named Naseri. 
 This man was your father's top operative. 
 No, this man is a fighter I recruited. 
 His name is Hamed. 
 You're throwing away your chance. 
 I told you everything I know. 
 Is he telling the truth? 
 Hard to say with the state that he's in. 
 His readings are all over the place. 
 Why would Naseri keep Jadalla in the dark? 
 Can you refine his readings? 
 I can try. 
 Send them to the annex office. 
 I'll review them there. 
 I'm in. 
 Carter, the loop is live. 
 Theo's ready to walk you through the disarming procedure. 
 Cut her loose. 
 Help me. 
 My God, they're watching. Listen. Listen to me. 
 Jennifer, we fixed the camera. 
 Okay? So whoever's watching, they're looking at a loop of the past few minutes, okay? No, I don't want to die. 
 I don't want to die. They can't see us all. Listen. 
 Listen to me. No one's gonna die. 
 My name is Eric Carter. 
 I'm working with the Counter Terrorism Unit. 
 I need you to tell me why they're threatening you, okay? 
 Just get this thing off me. Get rid of this. Wh-Who are they leveraging? 
 Get me out. Jennifer! 
 Hold her. Hold her! 
 Theo, you got to get this thing off of her. 
 Now. 
 Whenever you're ready. 
 Okay. You need to locate the wires that are leading to the detonator, all right? 
 There should be two. 
 Just underneath the lower right front section of the vest. 
 I see them. 
 Jennifer, stay very still. 
 Okay? 
 Theo. 
 Spliced into one of those wires is the remote trigger. 
 It's a small, black plastic box. 
 Yeah, I see it. 
 Okay, we're gonna deactivate it. 
 And once we do, you can cut her out of the vest. 
 Okay, so, first pry open that casing. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 The casing's off, Theo. 
 I see wires. 
 
 
 
 Three of them leading out from the circuit board. 
 Oh. What do you mean, "Oh"? 
 Vest has a backup vibration sensor, okay? If... 
 It'll go hot if the remote trigger's deactivated. 
 Jennifer. Jennifer. Jennifer! 
 Stay calm. 
 Theo, is there any way to take it out? No. 
 You're just gonna have to be extra careful when you remove the vest, okay? 
 One sharp movement will trigger a detonation, all right, usually with a ten-second delay. 
 Extra careful. 
 Right. 
 First step, you need to cut the short wire spanning through the circuit board. 
 It's not the long one leading out. 
 Confirm. Short wire. 
 Jennifer. 
 Please. 
 Do not move. 
 Okay? 
 Okay, Theo. 
 What's next? 
 Asim, we're pulling in to CTU. 
 Yeah? 
 This is Grant. 
 I'm, uh... expecting a team of subcontractors. 
 They're at the gate. 
 Yeah, I'm not seeing their clearances on the network. 
 Hey, we had a power loss on one of those servers. 
 That's what they're here to fix. 
 You want me to let them through, I'll need your override. 
 It's Apple, Charlie, seven, seven, nine. 
 Escort them to engineering. 
 They'll take it from there. Copy that. 
 Guns out. 
 Tip of the fingers. 
 Left hand. 
 Put 'em on the floor. John... 
 Please. 
 Do it now. I don't want to hurt anybody. 
 Swear to God, I'll pull the trigger if you don't do what I say. 
 You, too. 
 Turn around. 
 Face the wall. 
 Turn around and face the wall! 
 Cuff 'em. 
 Where was this? 
 Hawaii. 
 It was a long time ago. 
 Hey, um, you think Eric will mind if I borrow a shirt or something? 
 I got all this blood all over me. Just... 
 Nicole? 
 What's wrong? 
 It's a letter from... 
 Rebecca Ingram, the woman who ran CTU. 
 Offering Eric a job as an agent. 
 Sounds like they'd been going back and forth about it for a while. 
 Isaac, he never said a word. 
 And this was the same time he was telling me he wanted to stay here and settle down and have a family. 
 I just... 
 I don't understand him. 
 Was he just telling me what I wanted to hear? 
 Hey, come here. 
 Come here. 
 Come here. 
 Come here. 
 It's okay. 
 I need to call Eric. 
 What are you doing? 
 Get up. 
 I said get up. 
 Reed. 
 I've got a, uh, blinking yellow on egress three. 
 I want you to take a look. 
 It's probably just some kind of a drill, but I want you to do a full sweep anyway. 
 Copy that. 
 Go. 
 Move. 
 Yes. 
 I've got him. 
 I'm not gonna hand him over until you show me proof that Jennifer's safe. 
 You'll have your proof. 
 I don't know anyone named Naseri. 
 I told you everything I know. 
 I don't know anyone named Naseri. 
 I don't know anyone named Naseri. 
 Are you here? 
 Yeah. We made good time. 
 I'm down here at security. 
 I told them to bring you to me. 
 I'll see you in a few minutes, then. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, so, Theo, I'm looking at the last four connections. 
 I see white wires leading to some kind of a switch, and a single wire leading out. 
 All right, good. That's the trigger. 
 Okay, so clip the single wire, and the vest can't be remotely detonated anymore. 
 Got it. 
 It's done. It's done. 
 Jennifer, listen to me, I'm gonna remove this vest, okay? 
 Okay. But I need you to remain still a little while longer, okay? 
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. 
 Stay still, okay? 
 Hurry, hurry. 
 Hurry. 
 Oh, God... 
 Jennifer, no! 
 Jennifer, no! 
 Theo, I think she's activated the vibration sensor. 
 You've got ten seconds. 
 Get it off! Get it off! 
 Go! 
 Move! Move! 
 Carter? 
 Carter? 
 Carter? 
 We're good. 
 Jennifer, I need to know why they did this to you. 
 It's over? It's really over? 
 It's over. 
 Who were they leveraging you against? 
 It has to be Stephen. 
 Stephen? My boyfriend. 
 Stephen Grant. 
 He works at CTU. 
 But he's married, so no one's supposed to know about us. 
 Mullins, are you getting this? 
 Grant runs security... He's guarding Jadalla. 
 Put the building on lockdown. 
 I told you everything I know. 
 Keith, what's happening? Naseri was holding Stephen Grant's girlfriend... 
 They're using him to break out Jadalla. 
 Is Jadalla still locked down? 
 Grant's not answering, and security cameras are down. 
 Are you okay? 
 You need to get out of here, John. 
 Tell me that you're okay. 
 I'm fine. I promise. 
 But I need you to get out of here now. 
 Please. But... 
 Rebecca! 
 Move! 
 Stephen, stop! 
 Jennifer's safe. 
 We got the vest off. Stay where you are! 
 Jennifer's okay. I promise, Stephen. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Stephen. 
 You have my word. 
 Stephen... 
 I promise you, she's safe. 
 Now, come with me, and let's get Jadalla locked down. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 Go, go. 
 We got to move. 
 Nope. That's John Donovan. 
 Take him. 
 Rebecca! 
 I'm at B Gate. 
 Everybody's dead. 
 Mobilize everyone you've got. 
 We need a visual on Naseri's vehicle. 
 Grant took out the cameras in that section... we have nothing. 
 Well, somebody must have seen something. 
 Naseri didn't leave anyone alive at the gate. 
 Mariana, what about other cameras? 
 Sorting through traffic and municipal feeds now, but there are still a lot of vehicles on the road. 
 What about the perimeter lockdown? 
 We've got a full cordon in place, ten blocks. 
 Still no sign of pursuit. 
 We've been blessed. 
 Why did you lie to me? 
 Why didn't you tell me you were my father's lieutenant? 
 Not my place to tell you. 
 Whose place is it? Patience. 
 You'll get your answers soon. 
 For now, be happy... You have your freedom. 
 And we have a prize. 
 Asim. 
 Keep going. 
 Sir. 
 Go ahead. Forward. 
 Forward. Check that one. 
 What was that? Came from the van. 
 Check it out. 
 Hey. Open up the door. 
 Go! 
 Go! 
 Tac teams are commencing a ground search within the contained area. We're analyzing street camera feeds, but so far, nothing. 
 My God. 
 What? 
 DCPD's reporting a vehicle broke through the checkpoint at North Lincoln and Temple. 
 All officers are down. 
 They're looking for witnesses, but so far no I.D. on the vehicle. 
 Get choppers out there. Now. 
 And widen the cordon. 
 Access every camera feed you can in and around that checkpoint. 
 DCPD is trying to establish a wider cordon, but the additional roadblocks won't be in place for another ten to 15 minutes. 
 Just heard back from state police. 
 They're deploying units to the major roads, but getting them in place will take at least as long. 
 Revise the all-agency bulletin... 
 Naseri and Jadalla Bin-Khalid are at large and holding Senator Donovan, their location presently unknown.
