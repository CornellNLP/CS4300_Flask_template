 We can confirm this was a terrorist act. 
 But we don't know how many lives were lost. 
 This is the work of one cell. 
 There were 14 more cells, and they must strike as one. 
 But without the flash drive... 
 Carter will deliver the solution. 
 This wouldn't have happened if Henry Donovan hadn't given the Rangers' IDs to the terrorists. 
 We both know conventional methods won't get him to talk. 
 We need to use enhanced interrogation. 
 My people are already in position to pick up Henry and take him to a black site. 
 Go! 
 I want a name. We're good to go. 
 What is this? 
 What do you want? 
 Just the truth, Mr. Donovan. 
 This is crazy. 
 My son is a U.S. senator! 
 Okay. 
 If I don't get us free, this thing ends real bad. 
 They're not gonna hurt us, okay? 
 They need us. They need us to get to Eric. 
 And when they do, they ain't gonna need us no more. 
 Jadalla has my wife. 
 And he has my brother. 
 The flash drive containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged and he needs somebody to repair it. 
 You're not actually asking me to repair the drive, are you? 
 I'm asking you to help me destroy it. 
 I'm going with Carter to Jadalla. 
 Can't let you do this. 
 Tie him up. 
 I'm sending you GPS coordinates for the exchange. 
 Eric. Oh, Eric. 
 Baby. My brother! Now! 
 Get her to CTU, Isaac. 
 No! Eric! 
 Go! 
 Find Carter's wife and brother before they get too far. 
 And kill them. 
 _ 
 _ 
 If you are just joining us, there has been a terrible explosion on the George Washington Bridge. 
 Details are still coming in, but we are told that there are... 
 Sir? I've got Agent Locke on the line. 
 Where the hell you been? 
 You logged out of the building without telling anyone. 
 I had a run-in with Eric Carter. 
 What? Where? 
 Parking lot at 8th and M Street. 
 I was following Andy. 
 Following And... A-Andy Shalowitz? Why? 
 Carter said the flash drive with the list of sleeper cells is damaged. 
 Okay. 
 Jadalla Bin-Khalid took Carter's wife and Carter traded himself and Andy. 
 He's using Andy to sabotage the drive, permanently erase the list of sleepers. 
 But they got to know Jadalla's gonna kill them both the second he realizes what they've done. 
 It's suicide. 
 They know. 
 If we can track them, they'll lead us right to Jadalla. 
 Stay in place, I'll dispatch a tac team to meet you. 
 Then we'll try to find where Carter went. 
 He was driving his dark red Ford pickup. 
 Left here about 20 minutes ago. 
 Copy that, Agent Locke. 
 I'll backtrack satellite from your position. 
 Andy Shalowitz on a suicide mission. That's hard to believe. 
 Meaning what? 
 He's not exactly known for his fortitude. 
 Yeah, maybe he decided he had nothing left after you took a job he loved and lived for. 
 Sorry... sir. 
 Andy. 
 Andy. 
 I need you to keep it together. 
 Okay? 
 Tr-Trying. 
 _ 
 Now, you. 
 Fix the flash drive. 
 Recover the data on it. 
 I-I need my laptop. 
 It has the data recovery programs on it. 
 You're going to walk my friend through every program you have on this laptop. 
 You understand? 
 Isaac, we have to go back. 
 Try to help Eric. 
 Eric told me to take care of you, so that's what I'm doing. 
 I'm getting you safe. 
 They're gonna kill him. 
 You can live with that? 
 What you think? 
 I got to live with a lot of things I don't like. 
 You told me you loved me. 
 Maybe you want him gone. 
 Why would you say something crazy like that? 
 Because I've never known you to run. 
 And that's what you're doing, you're turning your back on your brother. 
 You know if you ever needed him, he would be there for you. 
 No matter what Eric had to do, he would be there for you. 
 So what do you want me to do? 
 Huh? 
 We don't know where they took him. 
 We ain't go no play here. 
 Isaac! 
 We got to move. 
 We got to move! 
 Come on. 
 Come on! 
 Nicole, you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 We need to call CTU. 
 Hell no. 
 Nah. 
 Hey... look... 
 Eric brought you to me because those people cannot be trusted. 
 Okay. So who you calling, then? 
 I'm-a call my crew. 
 I'm-a tell them, bring every burner, every weapon we got. 
 Meantime, this dude gonna tell us where they took Eric. 
 They messed with the wrong people. 
 You think you can do this to me and just get away clean? 
 I'm a powerful man. 
 This will catch up to you. 
 You're young. 
 That's gonna make for a very long life sentence. 
 There is still a chance for you to stop this. 
 Talk to your people. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks, Keith. 
 Let me know as soon you have any news. 
 Maybe Mr. Donovan here knows something that could help us catch Jadalla in time. 
 How soon until you're ready? 
 We're close, we're almost done with his medical screens. 
 How far away is your husband? 
 Minutes. 
 I've been able to learn about you. 
 Where you came from, the drugs, the violence. 
 I was just like you once. 
 Lost, unsettled. 
 Seduced by the West. 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 I know decadence. 
 So does your brother. 
 The way he looks at your wife... 
 I was so blind to the truth. 
 Until my father died. 
 Until you murdered him. 
 I should thank you. 
 Thank me? 
 You're the reason I'm here today. 
 Fulfilling my father's dream. 
 Jadalla. 
 All of what's going to happen now is your fault. 
 The laptop is clean. 
 There's nothing on it that could damage the flash drive. 
 We can proceed. 
 Recover the data. 
 What's happening? 
 He has triggered a virus. 
 To erase the flash drive. 
 Relax. 
 I'm not going to shoot you. 
 This was a decoy. 
 The real flash drive is safe. 
 And now that Hamid knows where your virus is, he can disable it. 
 You'll recover the list for us. 
 I... I won't. 
 I won't-won't do it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What did you say? 
 I said, I won't help you recover your files. 
 You're very brave. 
 Willing to die. 
 But... 
 ...are you willing to be taken apart, piece by piece? 
 Leave him alone! 
 It was my plan, okay? 
 If you want to hurt somebody, hurt me! 
 Stop! Please! 
 Oh, no! 
 Please! Stop! 
 Jadalla! I'll do it! 
 I'll do it! Tell me what it is you'll do. 
 I will recover the list. 
 Take care of his wound. 
 As soon as Hamid is through disabling the virus, we'll begin again. 
 John. Where is he? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 I want to see my father. Listen to me, Henry's all right. 
 You can see him, but I want you to hear me out first. 
 Hear you out? So that you can try to convince me to let you torture him? No, Rebecca. If he knows how to get in contact with Jadalla Bin-Khalid, we need to find out. 
 Not like this. 
 Not like this, Rebecca! No! 
 Your father will be given a chemical that stimulates the pain receptors in his brain. 
 He will not be physically harmed. 
 I want to talk to him again. 
 Talk to him again... No, that is not gonna make a difference. 
 He's just going to tell you the same lies. 
 And we are already out of time. 
 You saw what happened on the bridge, John. 
 There were families in those cars. 
 Children with their parents. 
 And the terrorists are planning more attacks. 
 John, do you really believe that this interrogation isn't justified? 
 If there are more attacks, can you honestly stand up and tell the families of those victims that this was a line that you couldn't cross? Oh, Rebecca. 
 When this is over, he's gonna walk out of here on his own two feet, in perfect health. 
 Unlike the people in New York. 
 I want to see that he's okay. 
 All right. 
 We need to begin, John. 
 John. All right. 
 Wow, I see that you were able to organize this really quick. 
 Weren't you? 
 Knew the people to call. 
 'Cause you've done this before, haven't you? 
 Another day at the office. 
 It's not like that, John. 
 I look at you and I don't even know who you are anymore. 
 I followed Carter's truck to the exchange site where Jadalla transferred him and Andy into a van, but I'm having trouble following the van. 
 They're using overpasses for cover. 
 Keep looking. 
 You guys close? 
 You and Andy? 
 I barely know him. 
 Mariana. Look. 
 Jadalla's van. Not a lot of cover in that direction so we should be able to track them. 
 Thank God. Director Mullins? 
 Good news. Give us another five or ten minutes, hopefully we'll have Andy and Carter's location. 
 I'm running a four-branch recovery algorithm. 
 First branch is already finished. 
 As soon as the program runs through the other three branches, the data will be restored. 
 This makes sense as an approach. 
 How long will this take? 
 Uh, based on what I'm seeing, ten, maybe 12 more minutes. 
 A little more. 
 You're wasting your time. 
 God is on my side. 
 There is only one possible outcome for all of this, and we both know what that is. 
 You people will lose. 
 You don't get it, Jadalla. 
 This country's so much stronger than your jihad. 
 And it'll still be standing long after false prophets and lunatics like you are dust. 
 Faded. 
 Forgotten. 
 And for the record... if there is something... anything on your side, it sure as hell isn't God. 
 We'll see. 
 I'm gonna ask you again. 
 How did you and Jadalla Bin-Khalid communicate? 
 Mr. Donovan. 
 You have to know that by keeping quiet, you're putting thousands of American lives in danger. 
 I keep telling you I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You see... we know that you gave him the new identities that the Rangers were living under. 
 We know that. 
 I'm asking you how did you pass that information along? 
 Okay. 
 Give him another dose. 
 The terrorists will almost certainly execute Carter and our analyst the moment they destroy Bin-Khalid's list of sleeper cells and activation codes. 
 You're assuming they'll manage to do so. 
 What if this list of cells is, in fact, recovered? 
 Every second we lose gives Jadalla more time to launch attacks. Okay, what's the alternative? 
 We got fighters scrambled out of Andrews. 
 As soon as we have their coordinates, the plan is to take the terrorists and the list out with a missile sortie. 
 You're talking about killing everyone on site, including our own people? 
 Keith, I am not happy about this. 
 They are brave men who deserve better. 
 We got to look at the larger picture here. 
 I'm sorry, but I can't go along with this. 
 I'll appeal directly to the secretary of defense if I have to. 
 This has been cleared through the SecDef. 
 The fighters are in the air, waiting for the coordinates that you're gonna provide. 
 Now, I'm gonna ask you just once. 
 Are you gonna follow my orders or not? 
 I'm waiting. 
 Come on. 
 A building... storage... Elsmore and Kingsley. 
 That's the warehouse. 
 Yes, I swear it! All right, all right. 
 I swear it, I swear it. All right, all right, all right. 
 Now, all you got to do is convince me you ain't lying. 
 Isaac. 
 Where's Isaac? 
 Over here. 
 Y'all see that? 
 Now that there dude right there is a terrorist. 
 A'ight? And him and his men, they're trying to launch some attacks that'll kill a lot of people, and that's your moms, your sisters, your kids, all that. 
 And they also got my brother, but I know where, so here's the play. 
 We go in, we grab Eric, and then we lay some jihad on they asses. 
 No, this ain't got nothing to do with us, Is. 
 This a government problem, brah. 
 It's my problem, which makes it your problem. 
 You understand? 
 Understand? 
 We handle business, Is. 
 This ain't business. 
 Why should me and my people take a risk for Eric when he turned his back on us years ago? 
 Speaking of which... you haven't been acting real loyal yourself lately. 
 Maybe you're right, Andre. 
 Look, I'll tell you what. 
 I'll make it worth your whiles. A'ight? 
 I'll double your cuts. 
 Every one of you. 
 You do that, you'll be left with almost nothing. 
 He'll still have his brother. 
 Family's got to mean something, right? 
 Or else what's the point? 
 I remember when you were all family, when there wasn't anything you wouldn't do for each other... 
 ...before everything was just business. 
 What the hell. 
 Let's give these bitches some payback. 
 My man. 
 A'ight, let's go. 
 Omar. 
 Nicole. 
 You got to hang back here with her. 
 What? 
 This is about to be a war. 
 No. Right? I got no clue how ugly it's gonna get, but I'm-a go after Eric 
 'cause I love him. No. I'm not just gonna stand here while you go off and save my husband. 
 Eric gave himself up to save you. 
 You go back in there and something happens to you, his sacrifice means nothing. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Brah... take care of her. 
 Isaac. 
 All right. 
 And turn your phones off, man, the both of you. 
 I don't want those bastards or the government to be able to trace you, a'ight? 
 
 
 
 I've got it. 
 They're holed up in a storage compound. 
 12917-20 Elsmore. 
 I was just about to alert Agent Locke. 
 Route the coordinates to the DoD. 
 To the... Do it. 
 Theo, patch me through to Locke. 
 Stand by. 
 Tom, Keith Mullins. 
 Have we got our target location? 
 DNI has issued a change of orders. 
 You are to prep your team for a cleanup operation. 
 Cleanup for what? 
 We're taking out the location with a surgical missile strike. 
 Say again? 
 DNI thinks it's our best chance of stopping the terrorists before they can activate the sleeper cells. 
 Does he know we got people in there? 
 Andy and Carter? 
 Yeah, he knows. 
 I argued against it, but I lost. 
 The DNI's order was final. Understood? 
 I understand, but I don't like it. 
 Neither do I. 
 Route the coordinates to the DoD, then to the tac team. 
 But sir... You heard what I said. 
 Don't make me ask again. 
 _ 
 Got it. 
 Naseri. 
 Be quiet. 
 Think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did? 
 Why is he calling you Naseri? 
 Because he's been beaten and he's delirious. 
 Get back to work. 
 I'm gonna kill you. 
 I swear to God, I'm gonna watch you die. 
 I said, shut up. 
 He's just finished the first three algorithm branches. 
 Just one more to go and the list will be whole again. 
 Once we have it, send the activation codes to all sleeper cells. 
 You hear that? 
 Very soon, we launch a wave of attacks like you in this country have never seen before. 
 So many that your government will be simply overwhelmed. 
 Oh, and what was it? 
 For the record... this is the proof that my path is righteous. 
 You know, you can keep hiding behind your religion all you want, Jadalla, but we both know this is just about killing innocent people... some of them Muslim. 
 Not that you give a damn. 
 You're a psychopath, Jadalla, just like your father. 
 Both of you are sad, little men, twisting your faith into an excuse for violence. 
 You liked that, didn't you? 
 You loved it. 
 It really gets you off, huh? 
 You can do better than that, can't you? 
 Huh? 
 Do it. 
 Do it! 
 Do it! 
 Hamid! 
 Isaac! 
 Who are they? 
 I just got an ID on one from the arrival. 
 It's Eric Carter's brother. 
 Does this change anything? 
 Can we call off the missile strike? 
 I can try. 
 Mariana. Mariana... 
 It's Andy. Andy? 
 You need to get out of there, now, Andy. You and Carter. 
 Really? You think? 
 DoD is launching a surgical strike on your location. 
 You have less than three minutes. 
 Go, Andy. 
 Come on. 
 Carter! This place is about to blow! 
 Eric, we gotta move. 
 Everybody get the hell out of here! 
 We got to move! Move! 
 Move! 
 God. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! Come on! 
 S.L.A.R. and Lantern verify direct hit. 
 Making visual confirmation on Egress. 
 Confirming, target destroyed. 
 I repeat, target destroyed. 
 Let me see, let me see. 
 I'm fine, I'm fine. 
 Keep... keep pressure on it, Isaac. 
 Keep pressure on it, all right? 
 I'm going back inside. 
 Stay there. 
 You brought this on yourself, Mr. Donovan, but you can put an end to it at any moment. 
 All right, just answer the question. 
 No... 
 Just answer the question! 
 Answer the question! 
 How did you talk to him? 
 Tell me how you talked to him! 
 All right, give him another dose. 
 All right. That's enough, stop it. 
 Stop it, you're killing him! 
 No! We're not. We're monitoring his vital signs. 
 I... 
 I don't care. I don't care. 
 This ends now. 
 It's over, that's enough. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 This is over. 
 I'm walking in there, I'm taking my father home. 
 That is not your choice. 
 You gonna stop me? You're gonna have to shoot me. 
 He's about to talk, I can feel it. 
 Let him through. 
 All right, fine. 
 Let him go, do it. 
 Dad? Dad. 
 This is a mistake. 
 I just got a flash from Keith. 
 They've located Jadalla. 
 They're moving in on him as we speak. 
 What? 
 Break it down, we're done. 
 John? 
 It's okay, Dad. It's okay. 
 There you go. 
 Oh, let's get you home. 
 Let's get you home. 
 We're gonna get you home. 
 Let's go. Go, go, go. 
 Andy. 
 Hey. 
 You miss me? 
 Damn it. I'm okay. I'm all right. 
 I need a medic over here! 
 I did it. I did it, Tom. 
 I got, I got the flash drive. 
 I should be able to restore the sleeper cells. 
 We can round them up. 
 That's good. 
 That's real good. 
 Where's Carter? 
 He went back inside. 
 Looking for Jadalla. 
 Ooh... 
 Somebody left inside! Let's go! 
 Stay down! 
 Where's Naseri? 
 Where is he? 
 Naseri? I don't... 
 He was here, Jadalla. 
 Where is he? Carter! 
 Tell me where he is! 
 Stand down. Stand down! 
 Go. Go. 
 Asim Naseri is in the country. 
 He was here, working with Jadalla. 
 Naseri? 
 You need to lock down the area. 
 Okay? Set up a perimeter. 
 Already being done. 
 Carter, are you sure it was Naseri? 
 It was him. 
 Look, get more men here, pull up whatever satellites, just do whatever the hell you got to do, okay? 
 You know what he is, and what he's capable of. 
 We can't let him get away.
