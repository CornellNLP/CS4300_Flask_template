 _ 
 She does not get to die quietly, Naseri. 
 We do what we planned. 
 Recite her crimes, then execute her while the world watches. 
 You should've stopped her. I thought this was a good plan. 
 You thought it was a good plan to help her turn herself over to these monsters? 
 She was gonna get them to release you, and then draw Naseri out so that I could take him down. 
 My wife is gonna die a terrible death and everyone's gonna see it. 
 What is it? 
 I have an operation that may be compromised. 
 It needs to be cleaned up. 
 Where? 
 A farmhouse, Ravenswood. 
 I want it done fast. 
 The cavalry's not coming. 
 You have information that could potentially save Rebecca's life and you're holding onto it so that you could cover your ass? 
 He kidnapped Naseri's ten-year-old daughter. 
 If we can get the girl from the safe house, prove to Naseri that his daughter's still alive, we might be able to negotiate. 
 Ara, my name is Eric. 
 I'm here to help you. 
 I see them. 
 It's a cleanup crew. 
 These are Simms' people and they're here to kill us. 
 Tell your people to stand down. 
 Take out your phone and call them right now. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 Unlock the phone, Don. 
 Hey! Inside the house, we only want the girl. 
 Just send her out and then we're done. 
 It's okay. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. 
 We're taking them down. 
 You come in, you die! 
 _ 
 _ 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Ara, I need you to stay in here while I take care of something. 
 Okay? Those people... 
 I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you, I promise, but I need you to go in here and don't make a sound, not until I come get you. 
 And then what? Where will I go? 
 Home. 
 With my father? 
 Yes. 
 Here, okay, don't make a sound. 
 All right? Stay down and be quiet. 
 Tony, I'm moving in. 
 Pull on this and keep pressure on it. 
 Andy, Andy, are you going to be able to unlock Simms' phone? 
 I've got three algorithms that are running password combinations. 
 It-it's almost there. 
 What's happening with Carter? 
 I'm trying not to focus on that. 
 Put pressure on it. 
 I can't believe you hit me. 
 Donald, I'm asking you again. 
 Call off your people. 
 I can't do that. 
 If they get to Naseri's daughter, Rebecca will die. 
 Do you understand that? 
 I wish I could help you, John. 
 It's over. 
 You can't keep this secret anymore. 
 Why would you kill this girl? 
 Because without the girl, all you have are some files on my server. 
 And they're just scenarios, bad ideas that never played out. 
 Without the girl, this never happened. 
 Get ready. 
 Ah! 
 Hold it! 
 Where's the girl? 
 I'm gonna find the girl with or without you. 
 Look... we had a little bit of a setback, but don't worry. 
 We're gonna recover the package. 
 Tony? 
 Who is this? 
 I've got Simms on lockdown, Tony. 
 This is John Donovan. 
 And that package that you're talking about... might be the only way to save Rebecca. 
 I'm listening. 
 That girl is Naseri's daughter. 
 We've sent Eric Carter there to protect her. 
 Naseri thinks she's dead, which means if he finds out that she's alive, there might be a chance that he would trade her for Rebecca. 
 But that won't happen, Tony, unless you release Carter and that girl. 
 Simms told me they weren't connected. 
 Well, he lied to you. 
 What do you think, Tony? 
 He hung up. 
 What? 
 Tony? 
 Get him back, get him back. 
 What's your name? 
 Eric Carter. 
 All right, go get the girl and take her out of here. 
 Just like that? 
 What are you doing? 
 Let it go, Sidra. 
 I'd go with you myself, if you hadn't've broken my damn arm. 
 You didn't give me much of a choice. 
 Find Rebecca. Bring her back safely. 
 Carter, Tony's withdrawn. 
 You're in the clear. 
 Listen, Mullins, saving Naseri's daughter isn't gonna do anything for Rebecca unless I can talk to Naseri. 
 We're trying to reverse channel Naseri's sat phone numbers from Simms' file, contact Naseri that way. 
 How long is that gonna take? 
 It's impossible to tell. 
 Director Mullins, NSA flagged a live feed popping up on jihadi subnets. 
 They're porting the feed through a server in Yemen. 
 It's impossible to trace. 
 What's happening? 
 Carter, there's a live broadcast going out over the Internet. 
 Rebecca's on her knees. 
 Bin-Khalid is standing beside her. 
 He's speaking Arabic. 
 What's he saying? 
 He's saying he wants to bring justice to the war criminal, Rebecca Ingram, "murderer of my beloved son". 
 They're gonna execute Rebecca. 
 I need that sat phone number now. 
 Working on it, Carter. Stand by. 
 I have an idea. 
 What? 
 On how to contact Naseri. 
 Ara. 
 _ 
 _ 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 _ 
 Ara? 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 Baba, Baba. 
 Ara. 
 Got a voice match. 
 It's definitely Asim Naseri. 
 Carter was right. 
 She never forgot her father's number. 
 Ara. 
 If you ever want to talk to your daughter again, you're gonna listen to me very closely. 
 Who is this? 
 Eric Carter. 
 I can send your daughter home, to Yemen, back to her family, where she'll be safe. 
 But you have to give me Rebecca. 
 It's time. 
 The Sheikh wants you to execute the sentence. 
 Asim? 
 Listen to me. 
 I know you turned this down before, but I promise you, this is the last chance. 
 If Rebecca dies, I will put Ara back where I found her, and you'll never hear from her again. 
 Asim. 
 He disconnected. 
 Looks like he powered down his phone. 
 Andy, tell me what's going on with Rebecca. 
 I'll send the feed to your phone. 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 What are you doing? 
 All right, Mr. Carter. 
 We will finish this conversation. 
 Asim, the woman must be punished. 
 I'll leave that to God. 
 It, it is not too late for you to change you mind. 
 Asim! 
 Sit down. 
 Sit down. 
 I keep wondering why you didn't tell me that my daughter is alive. 
 You didn't even try to save yourself. 
 You'd rather die than expose your country's crimes? 
 It wasn't my country. 
 It was me. 
 God willing, you will be punished for your crimes. 
 And you for yours. 
 The individual's identity remains unknown, but he appears to intervene in Rebecca Ingram's execution. 
 His motives are also unknown. 
 All right, Mr. Carter. 
 We will finish this conversation. 
 Senator, we're picking up Naseri's daughter now. 
 Once Carter has Rebecca, we'll deliver the girl to the Jordanian embassy. 
 And you trust Naseri? 
 To the extent that he's burned himself with Bin-Khalid, I do. 
 Yeah, yeah this is his only play. 
 And how come he's trusting us? 
 Well, he's not, Senator. As a condition of the exchange, he's demanded access to one of our satellites. 
 Just to make sure that Carter is the only one anywhere near the point of exchange. 
 So to get Rebecca back, it's all on Carter. 
 That was the deal. 
 And it was non-negotiable. 
 And if this works, N-Naseri, he just, he just walks away? 
 No. No, once Rebecca's safe, and if he has an opening, Carter's gonna take out Naseri and Bin-Khalid. 
 Uh, Senator, we're almost there. I'll reach out the moment I have anything new. 
 You think you're saving your wife, John? 
 Once this gets out, she'll wish she was dead. 
 Well, you seem to have lived with it just fine. 
 It's different being the only one who knows. 
 You develop this kind of amnesia that lets you get through your day. 
 But once everyone knows? 
 Once Rebecca goes to trial at The Hague, or wherever they wind up prosecuting this? 
 Every good thing she's ever done gets undone. 
 And you know what you're left with? 
 Rebecca Ingram, war criminal. 
 They should be here soon. 
 We were always moving, you know? 
 Living in different places. 
 That must've been hard. 
 I didn't mind. 
 Because of the trees. 
 Father told me they were my friends. 
 He taught me all about the cypress, poplars, willows... 
 Huh. 
 Do you know what those are called? 
 Uh, no. 
 No, we, uh... we didn't have a lot of cypress, poplars and willows where I grew up. 
 That's a shame. 
 Yeah. 
 So what are they called? 
 Cedars. Ah. 
 They're originally from Lebanon. 
 Cedars of God. 
 Some live for a thousand years. 
 And we have them here. 
 They are mostly the same, but a little bit different. 
 You're going home. 
 I'll tell Father about the cedars. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Mr. Ambassador, we're in the air now, and should be landing in front of the embassy in less than five minutes. 
 Director Mullins, this girl is a Jordanian citizen. 
 What was she doing in U.S. custody? 
 She was the target of an unsanctioned operation by an individual in our government. 
 The goal was to leverage her against her father, Asim Naseri. 
 Who was this individual in your government? 
 I can't get into that right now, but I promise, you'll have an opportunity to litigate this later. 
 I'm gonna consult with my state department... 
 With all respect, sir, we-we just don't have time for that. 
 If you don't receive the girl when we land, Rebecca Ingram will lose her life. 
 I need a decision now. 
 Very well. 
 Of course, the girl will be received. 
 Great, thank you. 
 DCPD will be cordoning off the area directly in front of the embassy. 
 Please have someone there to meet us. 
 Carter, it's all set with the Jordanians. 
 We'll be landing at the embassy in a few minutes. 
 Okay. I should be at Naseri's location by then. 
 Copy. 
 Your daughter's on the way to the embassy, Asim. 
 I'm on my way to your location, alone, as agreed. 
 And as agreed, I'm ready to receive the satellite feed. 
 Andy. 
 Mr. Naseri. 
 I've set up a connection to an NSA satellite which we repositioned directly overhead. 
 How wide a radius does it cover? 
 I've set the range at two miles, centered on the coordinates you provided Carter. 
 The function controls are located in a window on the bottom right-hand corner of your screen. 
 You kept your word, Mr. Carter. 
 I'll see you when you get here. 
 Asim. 
 That family you slaughtered in Yemen. 
 What about them? 
 Did you do it because you thought we killed your daughter? 
 That father was a traitor. 
 But his children weren't. 
 I am not going to explain myself to you, Mr. Carter. 
 Mr. Hammad? 
 Yes. 
 We're just waiting for the go-ahead, then I'll walk the girl over to you. 
 We were able to contact her mother. 
 We are arranging for her to travel here. 
 Ara will be very happy to know that, thank you. 
 Carter. 
 I can see you. 
 Continue onto the train tracks, stop next to the brick building on your right. 
 Wait in your car. 
 For what? You have to prove to me that my daughter is safely inside the embassy. 
 Andy's sending a video-link to your phone. 
 Okay? You'll be able to see Ara walk into the embassy. 
 When she does, you'll get Ingram. 
 You're gonna have to show me that my daughter is safe. 
 I'm reaching for my phone! 
 Start the video-link. 
 And give Ara the phone. 
 Copy that. 
 Okay. 
 Baba? 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 _ 
 Start walking her to the embassy. 
 Mr. Hammad. 
 Director Mullins. 
 Okay, go see Mr. Hammad. 
 Hello, Ara. 
 I'm Mr. Hammad. 
 I'm gonna take care of you until your mother arrives. 
 _ 
 _ 
 Naseri? 
 She's safe. 
 Start walking. 
 When I tell you, hit the ground. 
 Papa? 
 Papa! 
 John? 
 I need an ambulance here immediately. 
 Rebecca's been shot. 
 Andy, send an ambulance and tac teams to the area now. 
 Copy. 
 John? 
 No. Rebecca, it's me. John... 
 It's Eric. 
 John's the reason I'm here, okay? 
 All right? So I need you to hang in there for him. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Oh. 
 Yes? 
 Senator, it's Keith Mullins. 
 I just heard from Carter. 
 The exchange took place, the girl is safe, but, sir, there-there was gunfire and Rebecca was hit. 
 How-How bad, Mullins? How bad? 
 It's serious, but there's an ambulance on the way and they'll go to the nearest hospital, St. Catherine's. 
 We're gonna send a car for you. 
 
 
 
 Thank you. 
 What happened to Rebecca? 
 She was shot. 
 They're taking her to a hospital. 
 How about Naseri's daughter? 
 Safe in the Jordanian embassy. 
 Which means everything you've done will come out, and you won't be able to talk your way out of it. 
 You'll hear from the attorney general. 
 Rebecca's ambulance is exiting 29. 
 What are you working on? Signal lights. 
 I want that ambulance to hit green all the way through. 
 What Nicole said... that there's something inside you that... scares her? 
 Yeah? 
 I know what that is. 
 Because I have it, too. 
 We all do. 
 The people who do this work... it's a gift. 
 Oh, and it's a curse. 
 And it'll eat you alive if you don't deal with it. 
 "Deal with it"? 
 Go where it leads you. 
 John... He's on his way, Rebecca. 
 Oh, my back hurts. You're okay. 
 Got a clean entry wound above her pelvis. 
 Let's prep her for surgery. 
 Oh, God. 
 Ah. 
 Ready on three. 
 One, two, three. Oh! 
 I'm your nurse, we're in the E.R. 
 Rebecca. 
 John. Senator, back up. 
 They need to work, they need to work. 
 We're gonna take good care of you, all right? 
 When am I going to surgery? 
 Get another line in. 
 Oh... 
 Nice, slow, deep breaths, okay? 
 More pressure on that wound please. 
 Tell me what happened. 
 Blood pressure's 90/60. 
 Trade was done. More pressure please. 
 Bin-Khalid got his hands on a gun and he was aiming for me, but she... she, uh... she took the bullet for me. 
 Nice, slow, deep breaths. 
 I don't know why, but she did. 
 Let's get another line in, please. 
 When do I go into surgery? 
 She, uh... first thing she said when I got to her was your name. 
 More pressure please. 
 Blood pressure's 90/60. 
 You're the only thing she was thinking about. 
 Order two pints of blood. 
 Thank you, Eric, thank you. 
 Pressure's dropping, she's tachycardic. 
 She's bleeding out in the abdomen. 
 Get the crash cart. 
 Start CPR. 
 V-fib. Apply CPR. 
 Baby? 
 It's okay, just... 
 Stop. 
 Check for pulse. 
 Pressure's still dropping. 
 She's still in v-fib. Becca? 
 Clear. Now. 
 Resume. 
 _ 
 Senator... 
 Your father is here. He wants to see you. 
 Send him in. 
 Also, sir, your call with party headquarters is in five minutes, but they said they're fine to reschedule. No. 
 No, Nilaa, no. 
 Definitely, uh, you, you let me know when they're on the line. 
 Thank you, Nilaa. 
 I wasn't sure that you would even want to see me. 
 So... thank you. 
 If you've, uh, come to pay your respects... 
 I'm your father. 
 I know who you are. 
 I'm trying to understand... how this... happened. 
 How... how I let this happen. 
 I told myself I was protecting you, but now I... 
 Those soldiers... and all the people on that bridge... 
 and now Rebecca... 
 They're all dead because of me. 
 One little lie led to a bigger lie and a bigger lie and... 
 I trapped myself in all these lies. 
 But there is one thing that's true now as it ever was. 
 This country needs you. 
 The, uh... the latest poll says that you had a nine-point spike this morning. 
 That's because of Rebecca. 
 Why are you telling me this right now? 
 So that you would reconsider what I said last night about staying in the race. 
 He never gives up. Never gives up. 
 If you drop out, I will turn myself in to the authorities. 
 I would have done it before if I had thought there was any way to keep you out of it. 
 But you need to know this, son... 
 Whether I spend what's left of my life in or out of prison, I will pay for what I've done. 
 But a son should not have to pay for his father's sins. 
 And a husband shouldn't profit from his wife's death. 
 You would be honoring her life... by living yours the way she would've wanted you to. 
 Oh. 
 No. 
 Nilaa, they're calling early. 
 It's not the party. Um, I can't right n... what? 
 Uh, there's an FBI agent out here. 
 He says he needs to see you, something about DNI Simms. 
 I'll-I'll be right out. 
 Uh, I need to step out for a few minutes. 
 Can I stay with her? 
 Senator. 
 I'm Agent Dietrich. 
 I'm sorry to disturb you, but Director Simms was found dead in his office earlier this morning. 
 Dead? 
 I understand you were with him last night. 
 I was. 
 Why were you there? 
 I was asking about my wife. 
 What he was doing to try to find her. 
 Did he say anything that suggested he was about to take his life? 
 No. No. Nothing. 
 I'm-I'm really sorry to hear about Donald, but, uh, I've got my own situation that I'm dealing with right now. 
 Of course, Senator. I understand. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 I think I'd like to cancel that, uh, call to, uh, the party headquarters. 
 The sooner they know, the sooner they can pick another candidate. 
 I'm not dropping out of the race. 
 We need to talk this through. 
 Mr. Carter. 
 Director Mullins is expecting you. 
 Yeah. Uh, my wife is here. 
 I'd like to talk to her before the debrief. 
 Certainly. She's in his office right now. 
 Thank you. 
 They told me the funeral is going to be tomorrow. 
 Family only. 
 But the, uh, there'll be a memorial service in a couple of weeks. 
 I think I'm gonna take that vacation I've been putting off. 
 You sure as hell earned it. 
 Sir? Yeah. 
 Eric Carter just arrived for his debrief. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Uh, I'll be right with him. 
 Thanks. 
 Mariana. 
 Good job today. 
 Eric. 
 Nicole. Baby. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. Just, uh... I, uh... 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 No. It's more stitches than I can count, but... 
 I can't really complain. 
 I'm so sorry about Rebecca. 
 I know. 
 Where's Isaac? 
 Um, he-he had to go. 
 He, um, he said he just needed some time alone. 
 He's going through a lot right now. 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 Look, Eric. I just... 
 Look, no, Nicole. I, um... 
 I wasn't being honest with you. 
 And for that, I'm sorry. 
 But you were right. 
 I need this. 
 This is... 
 This is where I belong. 
 I get that. 
 And if this is what you need... 
 then I want to make it work. 
 I'm not gonna lose you, Eric. 
 I love you. 
 No, no, Nicole, listen, all right? 
 I've seen this life, okay? 
 And what it does to people, what it does to families, and I-I can't put you... I don't care. 
 Whatever happens, we can, we can get through it. 
 Like we've always done. 
 This is what we do. 
 All I ask is one thing: that we're honest with each other. 
 No more secrets. 
 No more secrets. 
 I got to go. Yeah, go. 
 I'll be here. 
 Let's go.
