 I believe you know of my father, Ibrahim Bin-Khalid. 
 My husband's team killed him in Yemen. 
 And my mujahideen killed them in return. 
 Asim Naseri. 
 We want to know what operation he's running and how to find him. 
 I don't know anyone named Naseri. 
 This man was your father's top operative. 
 No, this man is a fighter I recruited. 
 Why would Naseri keep Jadalla in the dark? 
 Two years ago, when Carter and his team were hunting Bin-Khalid, they hired Naseri as a translator. 
 Naseri used them to get to their highest-value intel asset. 
 He killed the asset's family. 
 Carter found them. 
 Naseri. 
 Be quiet. 
 You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did? 
 I swear to God, I'm gonna watch you die. 
 I said shut up. 
 There's one last thing that I need to take care of. 
 What you tell Nicole? 
 I need you to look out for her a little while longer. 
 Jennifer Marshall's been strapped into a vest filled with ordinance. 
 And I think Naseri is watching her on some kind of a Web cam. 
 Get it off, get it off! 
 You've got ten seconds. 
 Go! Move! 
 Who were they leveraging you against? 
 My boyfriend. He works at CTU. 
 Grant runs security. He's guarding Jadalla. 
 This is Grant. 
 I'm expecting a team of subcontractors. 
 They're at the gate. 
 Escort them to engineering, they'll take it from there. Copy that. 
 I wasn't sure you'd call me back. 
 I'd-I'd really like to talk to you. 
 Could you come here? 
 Absolutely. 
 Keith, what's happening? Naseri was holding Stephen Grant's girlfriend. They're using him to break out Jadalla! Tell me that you're okay! 
 I'm fine, I promise, but I need you to get out of here now. 
 That's John Donovan. Take him. 
 Rebecca! 
 Why didn't you tell me you were my father's lieutenant? 
 You'll get your answers soon. For now, be happy. 
 You have your freedom. And we have a prize. 
 _

 We are five minutes away from the overpass. 
 DCPD found a witness who was able to describe the vehicle. 
 A blue Ford panel van, possibly 2010. 
 Grab a photo of the make and upload it to image recognition. 
 And notify the manufacturer's tracking system. 
 I'm on it. Uh, DCPD is also setting up fortified checkpoints on all bridges and major arteries around North Lincoln and Temple. 
 So far, no sign of the van. 
 He could be halfway out of the city by now. 
 President's been notified and he's meeting with the cabinet. 
 The press blackout's still in effect, but he's ordered every law enforcement and intelligence service in on this. 
 Full interagency transparency. 
 If you need to take a moment... 
 No, no, I... if I do that, I'm just gonna start thinking about what they're doing to John and... 
 No, I need to stay on this. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 We should re-approach Henry Donovan. 
 Now that his son's been taken, he might open up about what he knows. I already left word. I can't reach him. 
 Rebecca. 
 I just heard about John. 
 It was Naseri, wasn't it? 
 He was here. 
 Yeah. 
 You need to let me speak to Jennifer Marshall. 
 She may have overheard something while Naseri was holding her. 
 Something that could help us find him. 
 She may not be in any condition to answer questions. 
 Yeah, well, I'll get her there. 
 Henry... 
 I just got your message. 
 What do you mean John's in trouble? 
 Henry, he's been taken. 
 By Jadalla Bin-Khalid, the man you sold those soldiers' lives to. 
 I... I don't understand. 
 Jadalla's men broke him out of CTU. 
 John was on his way here to see me and they took him. 
 He's gone, Henry, and right now, we have no way to get him back. 
 You were in contact with Jadalla. 
 You need to tell me right now anything you know or you think you know that might help us find him. 
 It was Luis. 
 He's the one they contacted. 
 He's the one they dealt with. 
 Luis? 
 Where is he? 
 He's still in the house. 
 All right, CTU agents are on their way. 
 Just make sure Luis doesn't go anywhere. 
 Rebecca... 
 I'm sorry. 
 You look like a ghost. 
 I told you, give John some time. 
 He'll come around. 
 They took him, Luis. 
 They have John. 
 What? 
 The terrorists, the people you did business with. 
 They've kidnapped my son. 
 CTU agents are on their way here now. 
 They're gonna need your contacts, electronic files, anything you have that can help them find John. 
 Henry, I did... 
 What? 
 It's over, Luis. 
 It's John's life we're talking about... your sister's son. 
 I have to think about my life and I'm not gonna spend the rest of it in prison. 
 You son of a bitch! 
 You're gonna give them whatever you have, everything you have! 
 Do you understand? 
 I'm sorry, Henry. I can't do it. 
 Luis... 
 Luis. 
 Careful, careful. 
 Father? 
 My son. 
 How is this possible? 
 God saved the Sheikh's life that day for this day. 
 To see his son come back to him. 
 Before he could reveal himself, he had to make sure that your heart was truly with his. 
 I'm sorry, Father. 
 No. 
 I came to finish what you started and... 
 I failed you. 
 No, Ibni. You did not fail. 
 You came home. 
 You came home to me. 
 Jadalla... 
 Your father asked me to join your men, to monitor your progress. 
 You have earned his trust, Jadalla, a place by his side. 
 Inshallah, with this gift you've given us, we'll have an opportunity to get an even greater prize... 
 The woman who's boasted to the world that she killed Sheikh Bin-Khalid. 
 How far is our team from the Donovan estate? 
 Ten minutes out. 
 Damn it. 
 Have DCPD issue a BOLO for Luis Diaz. 
 And send out an interagency alert, code one. 
 What's happened? 
 I just spoke with Henry Donovan. 
 Luis Diaz is gone. 
 He assaulted Henry and fled the premises. 
 Y-You need to send an ambulance out to the estate. 
 Right away. 
 I need to take this. Excuse me. 
 How we doing? 
 Hello. 
 John Donovan's execution in front of the world would make a powerful statement. 
 But he is not our enemy, you are. 
 You are the one who dedicated your life to hunting us down. 
 Who got a medal for leading the raid on my father. 
 Now, if you're prepared to answer for your crimes, you can save your husband's life. 
 Are you interested? 
 Stephen never loved his wife. 
 The only reason he stayed was because of their son. 
 He said as soon as Kyle left for college... 
 Jennifer... hey. 
 I'm sorry for your loss... I am. 
 But the man who killed Stephen is still out there. 
 And he is gonna kill more people unless we stop him. 
 Anything that you heard, no matter how small... 
 I'm trying. I just, I'm so tired. 
 I can't remember. 
 Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. 
 Just take a deep breath and start over from the beginning, okay? 
 What were you doing when they walked into your house? 
 I was on my laptop. 
 Okay. 
 Then I heard a noise. 
 I thought my dog had knocked something over. 
 It's okay. Good. Good. 
 I-I need you to count how many men there were, what they were wearing, what they were saying. 
 Excuse me, Jennifer, just for a second, okay? 
 Hey. 
 Hey, how you doing? 
 Well, my leg hates me, but we finished IDing all the sleeper cells. 
 They're being rolled up. 
 That's good news. Yeah. 
 Now listen. Your wife's here. 
 She wants to talk to you. 
 She is? Yeah. 
 I-I can finish up here. 
 That's why, that's why I'm here. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 All right. Okay. Um... uh, Jennifer, this is Andy. 
 He's just gonna keep asking you a few more questions, okay? 
 Okay, I'll be right back. Hi, Jennifer. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Hey. 
 Look, I'm s-so sorry I couldn't wait for you. 
 Isaac said you had to go after someone. 
 Asim Naseri. 
 I shouldn't have come here now. 
 No, listen, Nicole. 
 I'm glad you came, okay? 
 Let's, uh... let's talk. 
 I went back to the house to change clothes, and I found this... in the mess. 
 The way this reads, you've been talking to Rebecca for months about joining CTU. 
 To be honest, it was just something I was considering. 
 I'm not even... 
 ...not even sure I wanted it. 
 Eric, this morning, when you asked me why I started taking birth control, and I said I thought you still needed more time, do you remember what you said to me? 
 Yeah. 
 But that was a lie, wasn't it? 
 Baby, you're not happy. 
 Nicole. 
 You need this. 
 You always will. 
 No, listen, even if that was true... 
 ...it doesn't mean I, I don't need you, baby, because I do. 
 I do. 
 Then why did you keep this from me? 
 I was just... I was trying to find the right time to tell you. 
 I was, Nicole. 
 I'm not here to put you on the spot, but I think this is important. 
 It's not about today and what you had to do, what you're still doing, it's about us. 
 Excuse me for interrupting. 
 If it's okay, it's important that I speak with Eric. 
 It's all right. 
 Um, I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through, Rebecca. 
 Thank you. 
 Eric. 
 Jadalla contacted me. 
 When? Just now. 
 He said that if I give myself up to him, he'll release John. 
 Okay, what does Mullins think? 
 I didn't tell him. 
 What? 
 Look, I can't take the chance that he will say no. 
 I know that I would if I were in his position. 
 Rebecca, you're not seriously considering this. 
 Jadalla says that if I don't, he will kill John. 
 So this at least gives him a chance. 
 Rebecca, I know you want your husband back. 
 I get it. 
 I was willing to give up everything to save Nicole, okay, but I went in there to get that list. 
 I wasn't just giving up my life. 
 Neither am I. 
 Jadalla and Naseri... they want to stage my execution. 
 They want to show the world that they can defeat the woman who tried to destroy them. 
 They're gonna want to kill me themselves. 
 You want to use yourself as bait. 
 And I want you to finish them off. 
 Find somewhere that they can't see you and take them out. 
 This is our chance to finish what we started. 
 All right. 
 I'm in. 
 Can you get me into the CTU armory? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 I still have provisional status. 
 Good... 'cause I'm-a need a few things. 
 We'll be leaving soon to meet your wife, but let me ask you something, Senator. 
 How does it feel to be married to a monster, huh? 
 You're the monster. 
 Because the only monsters in this world are the ones who kill Americans? 
 No. No, those who, for whatever their reasons, murder innocent people. 
 On that score, your wife is second to none. 
 And you're a liar. 
 I wonder if you really don't know what I'm talking about. 
 I'd tell you to ask her, but... 
 ...you're never gonna see her again. 
 What is it? 
 If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you. 
 It has happened for a reason. 
 When I left for Europe, I... 
 I thought I was joining a better world. 
 When I heard the Americans had murdered you, I... 
 I couldn't rationalize their hypocrisy anymore. 
 That is why you had to make your own journey. 
 I'll never leave you again, Father. 
 And I will never forsake you. 
 We will fight, Jadalla, father and son. 
 We will fight until our enemies fall... and then... you will take my place. 
 It is time. 
 Shut up! 
 Naseri was talking to one of his men in Arabic. 
 But I heard two words in English. 
 "East July." 
 "East July"? Uh, are you sure? 
 He said it a couple times, yeah. 
 Andy. Yeah. 
 Director Mullins needs to speak with you. 
 Okay, all right, thanks. Listen. 
 I'm gonna be right back, okay? 
 All right. 
 Uh, hey, do me a favor. 
 Run this through analytics. 
 "East July"? Yeah. 
 And run a full interagency data-mine. 
 Use clearance profile A-116, okay. 
 Okay. Yeah, thanks. 
 Got it. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 You know where Rebecca is? 
 I thought she was out here with you. 
 Rebecca just left the building with Carter. 
 Okay, we can't reach either of them. 
 Well, last I saw Carter, he was on his way to talk with his wife. 
 Sir, this is what they took from the armory. 
 Glock 19, Beretta M9A3, 308 sniper rifle? Sir? 
 That phone call Rebecca got before she took off... 
 I recovered a piece of it from the local cell tower's memory cache. 
 It's encrypted, so it'll take a few minutes. 
 Okay, good. Theo, give her a hand with that. 
 Andy? 
 Sir, I do not know where she is. 
 Whatever she and Carter are doing, she didn't bring it up with me. 
 Do you think you can get ahold of Tony Almeida? 
 Rebecca was in touch with him today. 
 Can you find him through her cell? 
 I-I can try. 
 Okay, do it. 
 _ 
 Perfetto. 
 Half of the money's gonna be ready for us when we get there. 
 What about our cover? 
 The Belgian has our identities ready. 
 We should go. 
 Who is this? 
 Mr. Almeida, Director Keith Mullins from CTU. 
 How the hell did you get my number? 
 We have a situation and we need your help. 
 Sorry, you called the wrong guy. 
 It's about Rebecca. 
 We need to find her. 
 What do you mean "find her"? 
 The terrorists you tried to help her hunt down, they've abducted Senator John Donovan. 
 Now Rebecca intends to surrender herself to the terrorists in exchange for her husband's life. 
 How do you know this? 
 We intercepted a fragment of a phone call she had with Jadalla Bin-Khalid. 
 Has Rebecca tried contacting you at all? 
 No, she hasn't. 
 Listen, when she and I were operating in Yemen, we had two-way GPS tracking devices installed in our cell phones. 
 That way we could always locate each other if we ever got separated. 
 But that was a year ago, and she's probably scrambled her signal. 
 Mr. Almeida, this is Andy Shalowitz. 
 Um, send me the specs. 
 I might be able to wake up the device with an activation code. 
 We just need one ping. 
 All right, I'll dig 'em up and send them to you. 
 Rebecca Ingram's in trouble. 
 I need to help CTU locate her. 
 What does that mean, she's in trouble? 
 I don't have time to explain it, Sidra. 
 If we miss the flight, we lose the job, Tony. 
 You're probably right. 
 Stay on this road for four kilometers. 
 Nicole found out I was considering joining CTU. 
 You hadn't told her? 
 No. 
 And she wasn't happy. 
 That you want a job at CTU or... that you kept it from her? 
 Both. 
 
 
 
 I kept telling myself I was gonna work through it before bringing her into it, but... 
 Don't be too hard on yourself. 
 In my opinion, in this line of work... 
 ...it's okay to keep some things to yourself. 
 Even from the people you love? 
 Especially from them. 
 Civilians can't understand what we do. 
 What we have to do. 
 And we can't expect them to. 
 Nicole said... that there was something inside of me... 
 ...that she didn't think she could live with. 
 What's that? 
 I don't know. The same thing that made me... run the streets. 
 The same thing that made me pick up a gun when I was 12, with my brother and his crew. 
 I just... 
 I'm still holding a gun, I'm just pointing it at different people. 
 The right people. 
 Look, I believe in what I'm doing. 
 I believe in what I'm fighting for. 
 Just, uh... 
 ...she thinks I need this. 
 Do you? 
 I'm on my way. Good. 
 And I remind you again, if I see any sign that you're not alone... 
 I'm alone. I'm alone. 
 Your husband's life depends on it. 
 Let me speak to John. 
 Once you reach the coordinates, I'll send you proof of life. 
 We received the specs from Rebecca's former operative, and we're sending out signals in the hope of getting a response. 
 How soon will you know? 
 Could be any moment. 
 Sir, in the case we do get a signal, there is something we should consider. 
 I'm listening. 
 Rebecca isn't doing this alone. 
 She enlisted a former Army Ranger to help her. 
 Is that that same crazy son of a bitch who attacked those CTU agents today? 
 Eric Carter. Yes. 
 His involvement could mean Rebecca is planning to do more than trade herself for her husband. 
 Are you suggesting we let her go through with this? 
 I am suggesting that we think this through before we stop her, which I think... Director Mullins, Senator Donovan's kidnapping was a blow to this country. 
 But if the terrorists get their hands on a former CTU director, there are things that... 
 We've already revoked Ms. Ingram's provisional status, and we're updating security passwords and codes that she may have been exposed to today. 
 That's all well and good, but Rebecca Ingram's capture has ramifications beyond your passwords and codes. 
 You are to do everything in your power to bring her in... Is that understood? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'll keep you apprised. 
 We got a signal from Almeida's tracking device. 
 Just one ping, and it's weak, but it was enough. 
 Rebecca and Carter are traveling west on King's Highway. 
 Okay, they're less than a mile from the King's County sheriff station. 
 Mariana, alert the station. 
 Send them a description of Carter's vehicle. 
 Have them run an intercept. 
 Ma'am, this area is secure. 
 I understand, but I need to speak with Director Mullins. 
 He's busy right now, you need to get back upstairs. 
 Look, I need to know where my husband is, okay? 
 Ma'am, ma'am. 
 Sir. 
 Watch your hands. Sir, you need to calm down, sir. 
 Sir. 
 All right, all right, all right. Fine. 
 You came here to get an answer from Eric. 
 You got your answer. 
 I don't like seeing you like this. 
 Look at me. 
 When you and Eric walked out on me, one thought kept me going. 
 That you was moving on to something better. 
 Maybe it hasn't worked out that way. 
 What I'm trying to say... 
 It's looking like I'm gonna be starting over and... if you feel like you might need to start over, too... 
 You don't have to answer now. 
 You and Eric got some talking to do. 
 Think about it. 
 The sheriff's department says they're closing in on Carter's truck. 
 We need eyes on this. 
 I'm re-tasking a satellite to track their position now. 
 Say something. 
 Can you hear me? Yeah. I'm good. 
 We're almost there. 
 The turnoff's four kilometers ahead. 
 Hang on. 
 Grab the wheel. 
 This left up ahead? 
 Take it. 
 Step out of the vehicle with your hands raised. 
 On your knees. 
 I said on your knees. 
 Drop it. 
 You, too, now. 
 Over to the column. 
 Move. 
 We lost them in the underground, sir. 
 Mariana, do you have sheriff's dispatch on the line? Yes, sir. 
 Have they locked down Rebecca and Carter? 
 Dispatch says the deputies aren't responding. 
 We've only got a few minutes. We're not far. 
 You drive ahead, I'll follow on foot. 
 I'll only be a few minutes behind you, Jadalla won't see us coming. 
 Hey, hey. 
 I got your back. 
 This is Andy. 
 That phrase you asked me to data-mine, "East July"? 
 Yeah? 
 I got a hit. 
 "East July" is a subheading of some folders in the server at the office of the D.N.I. 
 Well, what was in it? 
 I don't know, I can't tell you. 
 When I tried to access the folders, some firewall kicked in. 
 And you used the clearance profile that I gave you? 
 Yeah, same one. 
 I'm still locked out. 
 Director of national intelligence. 
 I'm at the location. 
 Right behind you. 
 Tell me what you see. 
 It's an old football stadium. 
 Looks like it hasn't been used in years. 
 No sign of Jadalla or Naseri. 
 Carter, if this goes wrong, don't let them take me alive. 
 I'm not going to let them use me for propaganda. 
 Carter, did you hear me? 
 It's not gonna come to that. 
 Promise me. 
 Carter, promise. 
 Okay, I promise. 
 I don't see anyone. Excellent. 
 Jadalla, it looks like she's here alone. 
 Hello. 
 You kept your promise. 
 Now listen carefully and do exactly what I say. 
 I want you to move to the center of the field. 
 Did you hear me? 
 I hear you. 
 But I'm not moving until you release my husband. 
 No, you are not making the demands here. 
 You're gonna let him go first. 
 That's the only way this is gonna work. 
 Look at your husband. 
 Now do what I say, or my men will put a bullet in his head. 
 I don't believe you'll do that. 
 It's me you want. 
 You told me yourself. 
 My husband means nothing to you. 
 You want the woman who almost took your life! 
 You want the woman who killed your father! 
 Who killed almost all of your men. 
 Show me proof that my husband is free and safe, and I'll walk into that field. 
 You have my word. 
 This conversation is over. 
 Then I will turn around and I will walk away. 
 And I will re-dedicate my life to hunting you down. 
 Naseri? 
 Tell them to release Donovan now. 
 Release him. 
 Father, we can't trust what she says. 
 Listen to me, Jadalla, I want her. 
 You hear me? 
 I want her. 
 Do it! 
 Call them, Naseri. 
 Release him. 
 Watch your phone. 
 Rebecca. 
 Talk to me. 
 John's okay. 
 He's free. 
 Good, then... get back into the car. 
 If I leave, we don't get Jadalla or Naseri. 
 We'll get them another time, okay? 
 John is safe. 
 No, Eric, we came for them. 
 I'm not leaving until they're dead. 
 Get out of there, Rebecca. 
 I'm gonna draw them out. 
 Wait... Get ready. 
 What is it? 
 The field's soaked in gasoline. 
 Rebecca, get the hell out of there. 
 You're gonna read your confession! 
 I can't get a clean shot. 
 I'm not reading anything. 
 Your confession! 
 I said I'd walk out into the field. 
 Here I am. 
 No! 
 Rebecca? 
 Rebecca! 
 Jadalla! 
 Jadalla! 
 It's Carter. 
 Get me Director Mullins. 
 Carter's on the line for you. 
 Put him on speaker. 
 Carter, go ahead. 
 The terrorists may have Rebecca. 
 I'm sending my coordinates. 
 Eric, can you hear me? 
 Eric. 
 Rebecca! 
 Where are you? 
 Carter, what is it? 
 I think I heard her, I'm patching you in. 
 He's alive! He's alive! 
 Bin-Khalid's alive!
