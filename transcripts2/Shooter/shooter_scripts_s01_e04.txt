 Previously on "Shooter"... 
 I never should have saved your ass in Musa Qala. 
 As I recall, you disobeyed a direct order. 
 FBI, everybody down! 
 Dmitri! 
 Homeland, we got here first. 
 That's six months of work you're loading into thatan I think we got him. He sent flowers every year  to the mom of his dead spotter. 
 In the garage is Donny's motorcycle and his field box. 
 I'll keep 'em away as long as I can. 
 You can't just go back there! 
 Agent Bosack : We found Swagger. 
 Isaac : He was at Mount Baker less than an hour ago. 
 Get your men and get out there. [gunshot] [gunshot] [explosion] That's a titanium hip. There's a serial number on here that should match Bob Lee's. Congratulations. We got him. Jack : How do we know he's dead? Because I did my job well, Payne. Do you remember the story Daddy told you about Musa Qala? [whispering] Daddy had to be a ghost. [exhales] [car horn honks] [indistinct chatter] [exhales sharply] Good Lord, it's hot out here. We need to move this war, Bob Lee. Yeah, buddy. Man : This is Raider Six Seven, Raider Six Seven. Cowboy Alpha approaching village to Delta, over. [trucks rumble] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Donny : Raider One Three Actual, this is Raider One Three Bravo We have eyes on the supply convoy. Town is clear at this time. Continuing to observe, over Roger that, One Three Bravo. You watch over them and I'll watch over you. Stay safe and keep me advised. Actual, out. Rahim, you certain that this town is friendly? Nothing is certain in Afghanistan, Captain Johnson. Yeah, no sh1t. [indistinct chatter] Still clear. ♪ Man, something doesn't feel right. Donny : Ah, sh1t. Now I owe Perkins ten bucks. I figured we'd be out here at least an hour before you start talking about your damn feelings. [chuckles softly] ♪ Bob Lee : I got a peeker. Top window, my 2:00, behind a brown curtain. Cell phone? Bob Lee : Can't tell. He dipped back in the dark. Does not bode well. All right, I range that window at 320. There's a little wind down there. Got a vehicle approaching from the south. Hauling ass, headed towards One Three Bravo's FFP. One Three Bravo, you got a truckload of hostiles heading in the direction of your FFP, coming straight from the south. Acknowledge, over. What you wanna do, boss? We're not moving. Your man must move or he will die. You've been compromised. Abort the mission now, over. [indistinct radio chatter] Bob Lee, I know you hear me, goddamn it. Abort, over. Bob Lee... There are 12 marines in that convoy. Disregard the radio and get ready for a gunfight. I'll join you when I can. Maybe the next mission will be boring. Don't take too long. ♪ [man speaking indistinctly] Cowboy Alpha approaching checkpoint Charlie, over. ♪ [gunfire] [gunfire] [heartbeat thumping] ♪ [distant gunfire] ♪ [distant] Any day now, Bob Lee. [gunfire] [heart beating slowly] [gunshot] [explosion] [man chattering indistinctly] We got an explosion northeast of our position. Zero casualties or loss of life, over. ♪ [gunfire] ♪ [gunshots] [exciting dramatic music] ♪ [gunshots] [grunts] Move in. Move. Care package, ladies. Courtesy of Mama Fenn. Mama send your Joe-Joe's? Oh, God, making fun of me about my Joe-Joe's, man. Y'all should have seen him out there shaking like a little sissy. "Oh, my God, there's a shitload of guys coming. What the hell are we doing, Donny?" Luckily, I held it down, kept him safe long enough for him to get a shot off. Is there a stronger word than "hero," fellas? This coming from a guy with a chest full of medals. You got room for one more, Nailer? I'm just glad I got him before he got the convoy. What's going on, fellas? At ease. Doing a little after-action review of the mission? No, sir. I was just telling the guys how we lost comms with you when our radio malfunctioned out there. Right. I'm actually relieved to hear that 'cause I was worried that two of my marines disobeyed a direct order to abort the mission. I'm glad that wasn't the case. So who didn't maintain radio properly? Was it you, Fenn? It was my fault, sir. I forgot to clean it before we headed out. Mm, I'll tell you what, why don't you go on over to commo and clean the team radios tonight. I'd hate to have another radio malfunction during the next mission. Somebody could get killed. Sir. Well, damn, that's the thanks you get for saving the convoy? [exhales] Guess so. [dramatic music] [clears throat] Agent Memphis, hey. Matt Simms, Homeland. We... we, uh... we met. Yeah, the night you took Voydian. Yeah, yeah, sorry about that, ma'am. Orders. You understand. You can cut the "ma'am" sh1t. I've been a special agent for six years. Look, I need to speak to Voydian. Yeah, I thought this might be about Dmitri Voydian. He's not gonna be of any use to you. Why? Ugh, what did you, cut him a deal? Grant him immunity? No, no, Voydian's dead. [sighs] Our intel shows him murdered by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. Wait, SVR? No way, this is too messy, and to leave him out in the open like this. This is a message. Well, maybe it was and maybe it wasn't. Either way, it's over now. Wait. Um... did Voydian have any connection at all to Bob Lee Swagger? [laughs] What the hell are you talking about? Swagger was the lone gunman. Well, he squeezed the trigger, but I think other people might have been pulling his strings. Huh. Does your boss have you looking into that? Just something I'm trying to connect the dots on. You gonna answer my question? Well, I haven't seen any evidence suggesting a connection between Voydian and Swagger, but... well, stranger things have been true. Let's start over. You show me how they might be connected, and I'll give you any Homeland intel that backs you up. [tense music] ♪ You here to chew me out for real now? [scoffs] Think that'd help? Nah, what I wanna know is did you really think it was smart of you to disobey me out there? I think the bad guys are dead and I'm sitting here with you now. How long was that shot you took? 320. Wind? West, about seven knots. You aim at the grenade? Just the tip. [chuckles] Hmm. So in short, that was one hell of a shot. That it was. You think the enemy feels the same? I don't really give a sh1t what the enemy thinks. Well, I do. In fact, that's almost all I think about, and now they know that the great Bob the Nailer is here, at this forward operating base. You know how much your bounty's up to? Last I heard, 600,000. You keep getting spotted on your infil, pretty soon the Navy chaplain's gonna be talking to Julie. We weren't spotted, Captain. Those guys weren't on patrol, Bob Lee. They were coming right after you. We all saw it. Respectfully disagree. Either way, I wasn't gonna let the convo get popped to save my own ass. Right. Well, this is my opinion as your commander and as your friend, you gotta think big picture. And before you come back with some smartass comment, remember this: it's a hell of a lot easier to replace some truck driver than it is the top sniper in the Marine Corps. Slash radio cleaner. [chuckles softly] There's a lot more to this war than what you see through your rifle scope. [soft dramatic music] ♪ [grunts] Oh... make sure you share that with Donny. He saved your ass today. ♪ Night, Colonel. Julie : Bob Lee was a believer. He believed in his family and his friends. He believed in the men who fought bravely beside him. He believed in honor and loyalty and truth. So whatever the world wants to think or believe, we know they're not talking about the man we love. Each of us has had the privilege of sharing a part of our lives with Bob Lee. We know what it feels like to have him watching over us, protecting us because that's who he was. He couldn't help it, and I take great comfort in that. I know this is hard, but Bob Lee is with my Donny right now in heaven. [emotionally] Yes. Oh, my God. It was a good idea not to bring Mary. Yeah. How... how long can they keep this up? He's dead now. They'll move on eventually. Jim. That came out the wrong way. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. You're right. I'm sure that Mary and I can get back to our house now that Bob Lee's gone. You guys stay here. I'm gonna try to appeal to their human side. Maybe they'll go away. We'll take care of it. [cameras clicking] JIM: Hey, assholes. Have a little respect. [indistinct shouting] This could get interesting. What's a matter? You still think he's not dead? There's lots of parts, no body. It's not even 10:00 a.m. What are you, my sponsor? DNA checked out. The serial number on the hip checked out. If he faked it, it was smart. Either way, doesn't matter. He's dead as far as the Russians know. Oh. Why are we here? [clicks tongue] Isaac : Oh, you can leave it alone. Bob Lee's wife isn't gonna talk. I agree. I'm not talking about the wife. 70-year-old mothers of dead marines have nothing to lose. Jesus, Donny's mom isn't gonna be a problem. Don't personalize it, Isaac. She's not Donny's mom. She's a broken window. We're trying to avert a war. Get focused. Hugh... you really can't expect me to do this. I served with her son, man. You served with Swagger too. If you don't wanna do it... let's get Payne. ♪ He's handling something today. Great. That leaves you. Isaac : All right, listen up. Intel has confirmed that Mullah Abdul, commander of all Taliban forces in Helmand Province, is holed up in the village of Musa Qala. [tense music] Here's his latest video, uploaded about a week ago. Mullah Abdul : [speaking native language] Isaac : He beheaded several doctors from the U.N., two of which were American. 0600 tomorrow morning, first and second squads will surround the village. Once it's locked down, I'll go in with Captain Rahim to talk to the village elders, see if they'll hand over Abdul without a fight. You think there's any chance of that happening? Musa Qala is a friendly village with good people. They only shelter the Taliban if they are forced to. Exactly. That's why we're not just going in kicking in doors. Hearts and minds, men. Right, two to the chest, one to the head. Got it. [laughter] Hey, lock it down. Swagger, before you say another word, you and Fenn will insert tonight under the cover of darkness at a place of your choosing. You watch over me and Rahim when we go in. Any hostile action, you end it. Anybody try to slip out of the village when I'm talking to the elders, you stop 'em. Copy that. We're gonna give 'em a chance to make this easy, but if they don't take it, that's on them, and since we're going after a HVT, we'll have intel and assistance from the CIA on this mission. Our liaison right here, Mr. Meachum, anything to add? Nope. Just happy to be here. Happy to be here. Hey, something I can help you with, Mr. Meachum? Is Sergeant Swagger under you command or is he sort of a superstar free agent? Gunnery Sergeant Swagger reports to me. Why? I hear he ignored a direct order from you during your last mission. I'm probably not the first person to tell you this, being that you're CIA and all, but you're misinformed. Good, I was hoping so. Because you're gonna need to keep a tight leash on him when it come to Mullah Abdul. [scoffs] Don't worry about Swagger. If he gets the Mullah in his scope, he's gonna drop him. There are times when information is more lethal than ammunition, and Mullah Abdul is a guy that knows things that can help us win this war. I understand that. Mm-hmm. So go talk to whoever you need to talk to and have my orders changed from kill to capture. [whispering] I don't want him captured. Well, I'm confused. How are you gonna talk to him if he's dead? Exactly. I don't have time for the Company's bullshit today. Mullah Abdul has a treasure trove of intel in his head. Intel that can save a lot of marines. So you want me to bag him, throw him in a van, but report that he's dead? Article 92: Failure to obey orders. Article 96: Release of prisoner without proper authority. 109: Falsifying official statements. Do I need to continue? I get that you spent the last decade of your life having the code of conduct pounded into your head, but it's not gonna help us win this war, and I know you know that, or you wouldn't have traded pulling triggers to take a command position. Surprise, you read my file. Of course I have, and it tells me that deep down, you wanna make a difference over here. Now, I'm a thousand choices from being a true believer, but I know... I know what it takes to save American lives. I'm asking if you do. [soft dramatic music] ♪ Ladies, quit your knitting. There's been a change of plans. Swagger and Fenn, I need you to get on top of this grain storage facility outside the village. Neeman and Walker, convoy security. Everything else, including our objective, remains the same. You two should get going. The rest of us move out at zero-six. ♪ Bob Lee, this is the world's shittiest sniper hide. Sticks out like a sore thumb, and the wall around the compound blocks most of our field of fire. [exhales] Tell me the last time the Captain waltzed in and casually made a change to a mission. If the freaking weather forecast changes he wants a full briefing, and runs through the mission plan three times. Why not tonight? [knocks on door] Got a minute? What's up? I wanted to talk about the changes to the mission. I didn't change the mission, Gunny, just your role in it. I understand my orders, I just don't understand the reason for the change. You don't have to understand, you just have to do it. You worried about not being the hero? My only concern is about protecting other marines, which in this case is you. You're not worried about protecting your own life? As long as it supports the mission. All right, if the mission is to kill the Mullah, we can't do it from that spot. You're a sniper, you should know that. You do know that. Is that why the CIA guy's here? Take him alive? What you're seeing right now, we call that the big picture. There are grave responsibilities that come with it. One of which is knowing how to keep your mouth shut. Am I clear? [car approaching] Mrs. Fenn : You sure I can't fix you something to eat? Why didn't you call the cops when Bob Lee showed up? Bob Lee was like a brother to my Donny. He was a wanted fugitive. Whom I believe was innocent. Did you look at the facts of what happened? Facts can be twisted, but you can't fake the look in someone's eyes when they're telling the truth. Bob Lee swore somebody set him up, and I believe him, now more than ever. I've been expecting a visit... And here you are. Alone. ♪ It doesn't have to be like this. Son, you made your decision long before you came in my door. If it's not me, it'll be somebody else. I can't stop that. You can run. I'm too old to run. Please just go, go. I got nowhere to go. And my conscience won't let me keep the secret. My Donny would never forgive me... [latex rustling] And he'll never forgive you either. [suspenseful music] ♪ 
 
 You need a moment to pray? Read the articles Bob Lee Swagger left in his cabin. The Russians had the most to gain from the Ukrainian president's death. All right, so you think they hired him? Hired him, duped him. Whatever they did, the Russians hung him out to dry after the assassination. All right, so if they betrayed him, why didn't he expose them? To keep his wife and daughter safe. [exhales] What? No, no, nothing, I just... I like how you don't let go. It's... I'm... I'm the same way, and I-I think you've got some really interesting ideas here, it's just, how do you put Dmitri Voydian with Swagger? That's where you fill in the blanks. Ah. What did Homeland want with Voydian? And how did he get out of your custody and end up dead in Crimea? Well, we picked him up so he could be extradited back to Moscow. Was it about  Graznyole? What... what's that? Dated a guy once in college, used to give me the same damn look every time I asked him if he was fooling around. Finally caught him in bed with my roommate. Well, that guy was an idiot. [soft tense music] [clicks tongue] Well, Isaac said you were good, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to end this conversaon Because you're not really with Homeland, are you? You CIA guys never act normal when you're hiding a seet Look, I shouldn't even be telling you this, but this whole  Graznyole  thing, it's not part of the puzzle you're working on, so just... [mouthing] Let it go. You can't possibly think there's a chance I'm going to do that. [sighs] All right, fine. I'll see how fast I can bump up your security clearance. When that happens, we can discuss  Graznyole  outside of this office. Just do me a favor. Don't discuss this conversation with anyone. Man : Early this morning, the FBI confirmed that DNA found inside a burned-out sniper hide does indeed belong to former marine turned failed assassin Bob Lee Swagger. Yeah, we've been hearing Swagger was mentally disturbed, but blowing yourself up... Man : Certainly con... Honey, listen to me. Don't you pay any attention to what those people on TV say about your dad. A lot of it is just lies. I know. Daddy's not really dead. Hey, Mary, why don't you go to our room and I'll meet you there in a second, okay? Here, you can go play that game you love. You've gotta talk to her. Kids just process death differently than us. You know, I was reading some stuff online, it's not uncommon for them to be in denial. Julie, I don't care what you have read on the Internet. This... this isn't right. She thinks her dad is alive. He is. He's alive. What? Yeah, Bob... Bob Lee faked his death. He had to to get the cops and the feds off his back. Julie, I-I can't imagine how... how difficult this has been for you, but they found his DNA on his metal hip. Yes, it was planted there. Oh, my God. Julie do... do yo... do you hear yourself? I know how it sounds. Okay? But you've been going through hell to help me and Mary. You deserve to know this. You're my sister. And what about Jim? No. Julie... No, no. Look, I'm not... I'm not crazy. Okay? I mean, I-I married a marine. It's not like I've... I've never thought about his death. If he was dead, I'd be dealing with it. Oh, my God. [laughs] You have to trust me. You have to. Please. ♪ Donny : Bob Lee, we gon' die up there. I see ten other positions that work much better. Bob Lee : Man, shut your Joe-Joe hole. This is our assigned location. Donny : All right, you ready? It's a shitty shot, Bob Lee. Yeah, the worst. Turn on the strobes and call it in. Donny : Raider One Three Actual, this is Raider One Three Bravo. We are at our FFP, over. Roger that, One Three Bravo. I see you. Stay frosty, we'll be there in 90 minutes. Actual out. Hey, you going? I'll stay here, keep an eye on things. Your man will do his job? Hell, yeah, he will. Let's roll. He'd better. [thumping] Isaac : [grunting] Mrs. Fenn : [muffled shouting] Isaac : Stop, stop! [dramatic music] Stop. Mrs. Fenn : [straining] Isaac : Stop. Please, stop. [unintelligible distorted voices] [both grunt] [shovel thumps] [breathing shakily] ♪ [insects chirping] ♪ [cell phone buzzing] [exhales sharply] What? I'm wrapping it up now. I'll be out of pocket for the next few days. ♪ [indistinct radio chatter] [helicopter blades thumping] Looks clear to me. And who are you again, sir? Huh? I'm somebody that doesn't answer to you. [chuckles] Ron : Radio One to Actual, this is One Three. Village is clear at this time, over. Isaac : Roger, One Three. As soon as we clear it with the elders, we'll enter. Just make sure we don't get surprised. Roger, Actual. Rahim : [speaking native language] Man : [speaks native language] They are ready. One Three Bravo, this is Actual. We're about to enter the village. Be advised, we have no shot from this location. Just do your job. Actual, out.

[both speaking native language] ♪ [all shouting in native language] Isaac : What the hell are you doing? Gunny, you got eyes? Bob Lee : Negative. We have no shot. Send a quick reaction force. Uh, do not send a QRF. He's there. Just standby. Wait for the Mullah to show. [speaking native language] [speaking native language] _ [explosion] Ron : sh1t. That was Bob Lee and Donny's hide. Jesus Christ. ♪ You traitorous mother... [grunts] I was robbed of the bounty last time, but not today.

Now move. Isaac : Negative. I want this b*st*rd alive. I wanna know what he knows so we can take down some more bad guys. Acknowledge my order, over. ♪ Roger. Somebody zip-tie this asshole, get him in the vehicle. ♪ [gunshot] ♪ Get out of my chair. [exhales deeply] I warned you about Swagger. Swagger? This isn't about Swagger. He thinks he's a hero. They're impossible to control. He'll get a Silver Star for what he did today. And you? You'll be allowed to serve out this tour. You'll never get another chance to command troops in the field Like you have that kind of juice. I don't. My boss does. This was a test of your leadership abilities, and you failed. You know, winning doesn't mean whether your men like you or even respect you. Winning means lying to them to protect a higher good. Sounds like bullshit straight out of the CIA handbook. Look, if you want a seat at the... the big boy table, where the real decisions are made, if you do, let me know. [tense music] You got real potential.

I got you an Americano. I hope you like it strong. I take mine with two shots, so... Yes, the stronger the better. Mm, all right. Read me in on  Graznyole. All right. Now, Dmitri Voydian was running protection for a shady mining company that was operating in a small Ukrainian village. Graznyole  was what the Russians call the place. Because that's what it was named when Ukraine was part of Rusa. Exactly. So the mining company cut corners, the water gets poisoned, the mine collapses, pretty soon, hundreds of villagers are dead. This is what Karlina Ordenko was writing about. Voydian and his crew murdered dozens of people to try and keep it quiet. Hence the charges against him and the reason they wanted him back. So no link between this and Swagger or the assassination. Yeah, I'm afraid not. [exhales] But, hey, why should that spoil our afternoon? Wait, if the mine was in Ukraine, then why do the Russians want to prosecute Voydian? He didn't commit the crime in their country. Well, Voydian was FSB. That's the equivalent to the FBI. I mean, if you wiped out a village in a foreign country, I'm pretty sure the U.S. would take an interest. Not if I was running an illegal protection racket. In fact, they'd be distancing themselves from me. ♪ [exhales] ♪ How much of this is bullshit? [chuckles softly] You've gone to an awful lot of trouble to try and throw me off track.
