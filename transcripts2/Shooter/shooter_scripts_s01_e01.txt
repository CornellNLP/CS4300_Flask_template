 [wind blowing] 
 [gunshot] 
 Bob Lee : A bullet will kill you three ways. The first way: extremities. Miss a major artery and you got 10 to 20 minutes before you bleed out. 
 [gunshot] 
 The second way: anywhere in the tens, center chest. The bullet will tumble, lots of bone to splinter, the heart or the arteries get hit, blood pressure drops to zero. 
 [gunshot] 
 The final way is the kill shot. Middle of the skull, any angle. Like a marionette with the strings cut, you're dead before your brain can process what happened. Guns change everything, and a bullet is forever.

You think it has enough stopping power for you? ♪ ♪ Washington State doesn't allow trap hunting of wolves. But, even if it was legal, it's a bullshit way to kill an animal like that. If you're gonna hunt, at least give the animal a chance. Well, we ain't giving out chances today, asshole. [grunts] [both grunting] [dart gun fires] See how you like being hunted when you can't move.

Do you think maybe he's pulling your leg? Mary : I don't know. Maybe? Yeah, let's hope so. [both chuckle] I found it. Come on down and get it for your mom. Go grab it. I gotta put my tools away. Julie : Okay, honey. I got it all, right? Your orange chicken, egg rolls, and an extra sweet and sour sauce. Yeah. I did see that. I'm surprised though. You know, you went hunting all day, and all you shot me was Chinese takeout, huh? I had something, but I missed. Bullshit. You don't miss, Bob Lee. Missed you. Mm. Bless us, oh, Lord, for these thy gifts, which we're about to receive, from thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Both : Amen. Good job, honey. I think that was your best grace yet. You say that every night. [laughs softly] He does, doesn't he? 'Cause you keep getting better. There you go. Don't you get bored all alone up there? Bored? How could I get bored in all that beautiful nature and animals and plants? And there's a million things to do out there. But there's no Internet. [laughs softly] Exactly. That's the whole point. That's why it's Daddy's happy place. [laughs] Bob Lee : Up the wooden hill. It is time for bed. No, Daddy. Yes, Mary. Ready? [grunts] Boom. Here, get under. Story first. Oh, I'm... you know what? Your mommy really wants me to spend some time with her. Can we do story tomorrow? Please, please, please, Daddy. Okay. What do you wanna hear? Kandahar! Oh, honey, Kandahar takes too long. Tikrit? Fine, Basrah. [quietly] Basrah. You've heard this one, like, six times. Then this will make seven. All right. So we're going after Basan Al Amini. We got a small squad. Donny and I were on recon. Night vision? We don't need night vision. We're Marines. Semper fi. Semper fi. Why don't you just use your Kung Fu to break it? It's not called Kung Fu, Mouse. It's not for cutting wood. [car approaches and stops] Who's that, Daddy? Can you go get Daddy an OJ? Please? Go on. [car door closes] You've been parked up at the turnout for about an hour. Trying to make me nervous? [chuckles] I thought snipers didn't get nervous? I said trying. [chuckles softly] It's good to see you, Gunny. You too, Captain Johnson. Even though you were hard to track down. Couldn't find any place more remote? I don't mind people. I just like to see 'em coming. [chuckles] You look good, Bob Lee. How's the hip? Don't think I'll be in Cirque Du Soleil anytime soon, but getting by. Is this a friendly call or Secret Service business? Your lapel pin. That's color of the day, right? [chuckles] Damn, you really don't miss a thing, do you? Turns out a guy who ran snipers for the Corps actually has some value. I'm on the President's advance team. All right. You got a place we could talk, privately? Yeah, it's down here. [chuckles] I see you are still a bleeding heart liberal. You never know when sh1t's gonna get weird. [chuckles] What can I do for you, Captain? This is gonna be one of those conversations we never had. [zipper rasps] Ten days ago, a CIA agent was killed in Seneca State Forest, Virginia. He was shot by a sniper. We found the hide 1,400 yards away. Damn. No evidence of multiple shots. Damn, 1,400 yards. One shot, so he couldn't afford to miss. Lots of trees. Three steps and the target would be behind the canopy, right? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ That doesn't look like a .50 cal. .338 based on the slug. All right, so... 3/4-mile shot through the woods. You got humidity, vegetation,  hell, even the rotation of the Earth could be a factor. Boy's a shooter. [gunshot] ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah, he's a shooter all right. This was written to the President. It states that in 21 days he'll be executed at the Seattle Science and Robotic Center. The letter says, and I quote, "I am the angel of death. No one can stop me." We believe this is from T. Solotov. ♪ ♪ Solotov? Are you f*cking kidding me? No. What the hell is a Chechen sniper doing in Virginia? I don't know and right now I don't care. My job is to protect the President. That's why I'm here. I gotta check on my daughter. ♪ ♪ There's only a handful of shooters in the world who would take a shot from 3/4 of a mile away, much less a headshot, and make it, and you're one of 'em. That's why I need your help to stop him. You got plenty of smart guys around you. You gotta understand. We get hundreds of threats a day against the President. I don't have the resources to scout a shot taken 500 yards outside of our tier-three perimeter. Yeah, I got a handful of guys, but no one like you. Daddy, we gotta finish the porch before Mommy gets home. Yeah, I'll be right there, honey. As you can see, I'm kind of busy. What happened to you, Gunny? I'm asking for your help. The President is asking. Look, man... nobody blames you for Donny getting shot, but you gotta put that sh1t behind you and move on. I've moved on, Captain.

[Nadine speaking Russian] Hey, Dimitri! ♪ ♪ Dimitri! [both grunt] How you doing? FBI! Homeland, we got here first. Could you point that thing somewhere else? [grunting and breathing heavy] [speaking Russian] _ Shut up. What? Oh, come on, that's six months of work you're loading into that van. What's your name, Agent? Oh, my God, you Homeland guys are unbelievable. I mean, at least let me talk to him first. I assume you called the Washington State Fusion Center got your ops plan on the war-board? So that no other federal agency would step on your toes? Isaac Johnson, Secret Service. Let me get the admin on call. I'm having a jurisdictional issue. Wait, wait, I didn't have time to get it on the war-board. Regardless, he's my asset. At least tell me why you took him. Why do you want him? He told me he had time-sensitive intel. Intel on what? Voydian runs an illegal import business. You know what? I got a novel idea. I mean, why don't we work together, you know? FBI, Secret Service, Homeland, we're all on the same side, right? No. Let me see your shield. Agent Memphis. So you cowboy into a known Russian mob establishment over illegal imports? Oh, you thought it was something bigger? Yeah, well, guess I was right since you just snatched him up. You gonna tell me why? No. Nice to meet you. [exhales] She went down like a rock. Well, we worked hard today. Yeah. Deck looks good. Hey, I was gonna tell you. About? About Captain Johnson coming by. She just beat me to it. She said he offered you a job. Yeah, he said, uh, some sniper made a crazy threat against the President. Wanted me to help him clear it. Sniper who? Solotov? Jesus. [exhales] Listen, I know that you don't like to talk about this stuff, but what happened to Donny, I know that it still hurts you.

 We've been going over this plan for a week, sir. We're ready to get after it. Status change on the Chechen sniper? He could be everywhere or nowhere. Either way, we're good to go. You know they brought that asshole here to nail you, right? If he's keeping me from getting behind my rifle, he already has. I'm not doing anybody any favors PT-ing all day. You're not doing any favors if you get yourself kild eith. Yes, sir. You and Donny ready for the green light? 100%, sir. Consider it lit. Hey, stay dangerous. Yes, sir! Time to hunt, Pork. Damn, finally. What's the plan? Overwatch for Delta. We got a four klick hump to our number one. Four, that's all? Thought this was gonna be hard. At this rate, I'ma die of old age. That's the best way to die. All right, get your sh1t in one bag and let's go. All right, all right. It's about damn time, gentlemen. Man : Pork gonna get some. Bob Lee : Donny had a saying. "A bullet is forever." And one day I'm like, "What the hell is that supposed to mean?" And he just smiles and says, "You'll see." So we're in this shitty pile of rocks outside of Kandahar. [gravel crunching] Bob Lee : Slow down, Donny. We heard Solotov was nearby, but we'd been camped out for, like, a week and nothing. Donny : Could have exited from either side of the compass. Besides, there's been nothing on the infrared for week. No man lays still for that long. Yeah, you wanna bet your life on that? I'm a Marine. I'm already betting my life. Donny wanted to go south. It was faster. My gut said we go north. Bob Lee : All right, go north. Donny : You're The Nailer. I told you not to call me that. I'd love it if somebody would call me something cool. You don't like Pork? Pork's cool. You've had three spotters. You called all of them Pork. It's easy to remember. I don't even like bacon. All right, I'm going first. No, no, no. Bob Lee : I'm not making that call to your mama. After me, Pork. [ominous music] I heard it before I felt it. [gunshot] Ah! [grunts] Solotov misjudged the wind, but he... recalculated for a second shot. [voice echoing] Donny, no! [gunshot] He was dead before he fell. ♪ ♪ Donny! ♪ ♪ Donny was right. [exhales deeply] A bullet is forever. He died because I trusted my gut. ♪ ♪ No, he didn't. He died because Solotov shot him. That wasn't your fault. ♪ ♪ Look... I love you, and I would never tell you how to live your life, but maybe the best way to put this behind you... is pay back the favor. Punch Solotov's ticket. And what if my instincts are wrong? Then you adjust your dope and you fire again. ♪ ♪ I love it when you talk sexy. Prove it. Isaac : Jack Payne, Bob Lee Swagger. Payne's Counter-terrorism. He's our Solotov expert. Your paperwork is still moving, but I don't wanna lose a day. We consider this a real threat. Motorcade stops there. Dignitaries and special visitors at the rope line. He'll shake a few hands? Yeah, but we got that covered. Agents around him and in the crowd. Consider it 15 seconds from the Beast to the podium. How are you protecting his six? Triple thick bulletproof backdrop behind him. It'll stop anything. He presents with the Ukrainian president, then they take a tour inside. Since Solotov warned you, why not cancel? [chuckles] If we cancelled every credible threat we got, he'd never leave the White House. They schedule him, I secure him. That's the drill. Even if we could move it, we want Solotov, so if he's gonna be here, let's figure out where. Now, Flashlight's route won't be made public till the day before, so... He doesn't need to know the route. He knows where it ends. He's not gonna take a shot at the President's limo. It might as well be a tank. Solotov's not gonna take any chances. If he's hunting, he's gonna wait for his shot and it'll be perfect. And that's exactly why I need you, Bob Lee. You're the only one who can neutralize him. I need a complete workup. Distances, location possibilities, everything. We've got some nice range tech, too. I can set you up. Without firing his rifle, most of it'll be educated guessing. [scoffs] sh1t, Bob Lee, your educated guess is better than most. Jack : We got these 12 hours ago. [soft dramatic music] Say hello to T. Solotov. That's the only known photo of him, taken from a drone over the Sudan. Drone wasn't even supposed to be there. The pilot was taking the scenic route home, caught it by accident. [chuckles] Modified Saber-Forsst. Damn. We rebuilt it from the photo. Right down to his custom optics. We'll ship it to you. All right, I'll get the ammo and start shooting right away. I'll check in in a couple days. Sooner the better. [exhales] So that's the great "Bob The Nailer", huh? He don't seem like much. There was this, uh, girls' school in Afghanistan, three miles south of Jupar. Bob Lee and his spotter were alone doing recon when they saw a platoon of Taliban bearing down on the school. You know what the Taliban does to young girls in Afghanistan trying to get an education. Bob Lee and his spotter could have simply moved on. No one would have ever known they were there. Instead, he took on 200 Taliban over 46 hours. Moving and shooting. Didn't sleep, didn't eat, just hunted. 51 kills, all command level. And that girls' school? It's still there to this day. [chuckles] Taliban won't go near it. They say it's cursed. Underestimate Bob Lee Swagger at your own peril. He's the real deal. ♪ Loneliness is an awful thing ♪

Sir, those Homeland guys are always yelling national security whenever they're snaking a bust. I worked Dimitri Voydian for six months. Did you know he was Russian FSB? Sent over this morning, courtesy of Homeland. Russia said he was disavowed right around the time you two met. He was handling security for a small sect of the Bratva feeding us intel on rival gangs. Nadine, if it got out that the FBI was helping a Russian spy... Homeland did us a favor. Look, Voydian called me, said he had information that was gonna get him killed. He said he would only give it to me. He was desperate. Like I don't have enough trouble with this mess? And now you want to open a new investigation because you got egg on your face? Sit down. Do me a favor. Do something you don't normally do. Listen to me and do not get involved in this Voydian mess. That's an order. You're right. You've given me multiple chances. You deserve better. I'm sorry. Stop, you're not any good at that. At what? Kissing ass. Oh, and since you're so happy to work with the Secret Service, they sent this. President's visit means they prioritize potential threats into three groups. Those are the Charlies. So the least threatening. Mainly, any wacko with an email account. If someone seems off, send it to me and I'll pass it along. Oh, and they need to be cleared. Oh, and Nadine? I know you're trying. I appreciate it, but you need to try harder. [indistinct chatter] [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [bells jingle] Henry : Here are the shells. Good luck with the bird. Good to see you, Bob Lee. Got your regular order right here. Not today, Henry.

[quietly speaking in Russian] _ Nadine : The last time Voydian and I talked, he was nervous about something. It was bigger than imports. Before you guys took him away, he left information for me. He hid it in one of the massage rooms. ♪ ♪ They're all written by the same journalist, Karlyna Ordenko. Now, my Ukrainian isn't great, but... something about a city called Graznyole. According to her, the Russians are getting ready to stage something big. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Bob Lee : The President's motorcade enters  the kill zone at 12:34... [siren whoops] Off 4th and then onto the turnout  before coming to a stop. [tires squeal] [cheers and applause] He'll exit the Beast, followed by the Ukrainian president, shake a few hands, then make his way to the podium where he'll speak for approximately seven minutes. Might as well be seven years for a sniper. Knowing exactly where the President will be standing gives Solotov an advantage that's almost unbeatable. It's gonna have your team doubling, tripling security, covering every angle of attack, which is why he's not gonna take the shot there. He's gonna take the shot here, the moment he gets out of his limo. No, Swagger, that... that's not possible. Let him continue, Payne. [exhales] The human head is roughly 22 inches in circumference. The gap from his limo to the rope line is 3 yards. President's gait makes that 2 1/2 steps. At 1,000 yards, the shooter has almost two full seconds to make the shot. It is the best location hands down. [bullet whistles] ♪ ♪ Solotov's not gonna take that shot. Because you're moving in a giant flag as an obstruction. Hanging from a crane across Denny Way. ♪ ♪ That was classified. How'd you find out? The same way Solotov will, by doing my homework. On top of this parking garage, at 1,400 yards, he has no obstructions to the motorcade stop,  but he's gotta shoot fast. He can pre-rig the mount to the exact height as long as he stops in the right spot. No way he's getting away. We've got air, ground. He wouldn't get ten feet. And Solotov has no history of mobile hits. ♪ ♪ Whatever you think you know about Solotov, he knows ten times about you. He's a master sniper. The guy has worked in the worst conditions mankind has ever created, under all kinds of heavy fire with one goal: to kill his target. He knows the window around the event,  he knows the Secret Service schedule,  he knows the perimeters, and he knows the exact moment to take the shot, and he's gonna take it from here. ♪ ♪ 1,580 yards, line of sight to the President for a full three seconds, wide enough so the wind won't be a surprise. Got Solotov here shooting low, sunlight behind him so the target's well lit. He'll be out the door before you hear the shot. But he won't shoot through glass. It'll screw with trajectory. Small wired charges... will break the window timed to the shot. No one'll hear the glass until it's too late. [quiet explosion] [glass clatters] [gunshot] [bullet whistles] That's how it's gonna go down. The President appreciates you jumping in. If you're available, I know he'd like to thank you personally. That won't be necessary, Captain. I'm happy to help. Trust me. He won't take "no" for an answer. Payne, get your team ready. You guys can prep here. I'm gonna get the man who shot you, Bob Lee.

Passed 'em on last night. Something wrong? Yeah, there was one guy on the list, ex-Marine, seemed off. I didn't see any Marine. It's just that he was... it was odd that he was being considered a Charlie. His record was completely clean, sparkling. Yeah. Anyway, you going to this thing? No, I've met the President.
