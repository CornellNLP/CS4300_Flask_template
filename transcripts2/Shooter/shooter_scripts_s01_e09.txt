 Bob : Previously on "Shooter"... 
 That's six shots. 1,500 yards. 
 What's that guy's name? 
 Lon Scott. 
 He's a hell of a shooter. 
 If we don't start working together... 
 Together? 
 I know you're onto Lon Scott, and you are going to need help. 
 Just because you realized you're expendable doesn't make us partners. 
 It doesn't mean we don't need to be. 
 I need a path out. 
 Find Payne. 
 Get the thumb drive. I'll fund your IRA. 
 [groans] 
 God, you're a dumb-ass. 
 The thumb drive? 
 Lon : They hired Swagger to kill us. 
 Now he's gonna kill them instead. 
 You arranged this with Swagger? 
 Worth the risk in order to get my shot at him. 
 For years, I wanted to be as good as you, but... we both know I'm better now. 
 I'm the sniper. 
 You're just a... marksman. 
 You could be implicated, too, Lon. 
 Anhur is all over that thumb drive. 
 You know Swagger's here, right? 
 I had hoped so. 
 Why? 
 Because you failed. 
 Now I'm gonna finish it. 
 Swagger still lives. 
 It's being handled. 
 I don't like the unknown. 
 Then get out of the espionage business. 
 Perhaps we'll dig a hole for you, Mr. Meachum. 
 Swagger's gone. He's got Annex B. 
 Krukov : Our mutual friends will not be pleased. 
 Good-bye, Mr. Meachum. 
 Hey, you remember the old Ranger station? 
 Are we in trouble? 
 Bob : I need you and Mary to get there as soon as you can. Can you slip away quietly? 
 Yes, definitely. Where are you going? 
 You've always covered for me. 
 I need you to do it this one last time. 
 Can I speak to Julie? Simon Porter. She knows me. 
 You've got one second to get your foot out of my door before I break it. 
 Lon : What do you want, Porter? 
 Julie Swagger's gone. 
 I'll have someone there within the hour. 
 Mama needs you underneath the bed, all right? 
 You can't come out until Mama comes back for you. 
 Okay? Promise me. 
 Promise.

 We have to find Mary. We have to. 
 Some man took her from the back of the... a van a few minutes ago. 
 Look, we have to get her. 
 We are gonna get her back. 
 We have to. 
 Okay? 
 No, no. No. 
 Yes, yes. Calm down. 
 If we lose our heads, we lose everything. 
 No, listen, listen, you don't... you don't know where she is. You don't know who took her. 
 What's going on? We have to go to the FBI. 
 You do that, they'll kill her. 
 What? 
 Sweetheart, he's with me. 
 What? 
 It's complicated, honey. 
 What? 
 It's complicated. 
 No, it's not. 
 That is the asshole who started all of this. 
 And I'm the asshole who's gonna help end it. 
 We got to clear this location now. 
 No, I don't trust him. I don't trust him. 
 You don't have to trust him. Trust me. 
 If I didn't think he could help us get Mary back, he wouldn't be here.

 Someone took Mary. 
 I know. Krukov has her. 
 I followed them, but... 
 I've gone as far as I can go. 
 What do you mean, "As far as you can go"? 
 You lost them? 
 No. I'm... 
 Where are they?
