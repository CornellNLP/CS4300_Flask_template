 BOB LEE: Previously on "Shooter"... 
 SAM: Your daddy made a video confession. 
 He was a major when I knew him. 
 EARL: His name is Ray Brooks. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 Brooks has quietly been working his way up from DA and now the federal bench. 
 You worked with Atlas for years. 
 What's their end game? 
 What's the final check on absolute power? The Supreme Court. 
 ANDREW: Ladies and gentlemen, our next chief justice of the Supreme Court, Ray Brooks. 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 You're DOJ. Tell me what you want. 
 Atlas. We can work together. 
 HARRIS: Mr. Gold. It's about the Alpha Boys. 
 Social media makes it a lot easier to be a racist these days. 
 Don't ever try to blackmail anyone. 
 You suck at it. 
 Earl Swagger's evidence might be in play too. 
 Where are you with the card? - RAY: They broke into Titan. 
 NADINE: This thing decrypts real-time locations on Congress, the Cabinet, everybody. 
 JACK: What do you want? 
 Get me off that list. 
 Do you have the card? Give me 48 hours.

 They killed my wife. There's no running from that. 
 [BOTH MEN GRUNTING] 
 Sam, can you hear me? 
 He took a turn for the worse. I'm sorry. 
 [CRYING] I miss you already. 
 RED JR.: The Swaggers ain't worth dying over. 
 Junior. 
 Soon everyone will know it was his mistake that might cost us everything. 
 Russo, you can't be asking me to do this. 
 He's my son.

 Let me take a wild guess and say Swagger's screening. 
 Junior's probably running scared. 
 His dad probably already got him out of the country.

 It's his place, man, no bullshit. 
 Earl's confession might not be enough. 
 Whatever happened in Laos was covered up a long time ago. 
 We know how Atlas works. 
 Even if we came forward with Earl's tape, it would be the word of a dead man against that of a future chief justice of the Supreme Court. 
 They're gonna act like Brooks is getting swift-boated. 
 CARLITA: Yeah, and they'll have Edie Poole on TV in three seconds flat telling the world about her affair with Earl. 
 By the time they're done, Swagger's dad will look like he's the villain. 
 Does Brooks have the votes he needs to get confirmed? 
 Uh, not yet. Why? What are you thinking? 
 Atlas will need to swing those senators voting against him, Not Atlas' style. 
 They'll eliminate those senators. 
 We stop that, we stop the confirmation hearing altogether, force Brooks to take himself out of the equation. 
 Run right at him. 
 Wait, why would he do that voluntarily? 
 Start with Earl's video tape and then move on from there. 
 Move on to what? We get Brooks out, there's no way Atlas has a backup justice in the wings. 
 The op will die. 
 We're gonna need Brooks' schedule. 
 You guys are talking about blackmailing a Supreme Court nominee. 
 Do you want to help, or do you want to keep asking questions? 
 Technically, I can do both. 
 Harris. Okay.

 We're all very thankful for your sacrifice, Red. 
 No one ever questioned your loyalty before, and certainly no one ever will now. 
 Gold, if I liked the smell of bullshit, I'd go back to the slaughterhouse. 
 I heard from Russo. 
 He wants you to take over the top spot, see this thing through. 
 He and I agree, you should take a run at Swagger. 
 Ah, we'd just be kicking the hornet's nest. 
 Make him come after us that much harder.
