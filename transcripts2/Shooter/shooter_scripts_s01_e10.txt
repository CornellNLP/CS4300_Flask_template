 Bob Lee : Previously on "Shooter"... 
 What can I do for you, Captain? 
 This was written to the president. 
 It states that in 21 days he'll be executed. 
 [gunshot, crowd screaming] 
 Hey, Swagger. 
 [gunshots] 
 Stay on the ground now! 
 Hands behind your head! 
 My name is Bob Lee Swagger! 
 I did not kill the president! 
 All you had to do was shoot him. 
 I want my lawyer. His name is Sam Vincent. 
 The evidence is compelling. 
 Does that sound like me? I'll confess to trying to kill the president, but my wife and daughter are left alone. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm gonna do what I do best. I'm gonna hunt. 
 I don't like the unknown. 
 I'll deal with Swagger. 
 Nadine : This whole thing seems off. 
 Do you believe me now? 
 Yes, I believe you now. 
 I need you as an asset inside the government. 
 So are we partners? 
 Memphis. 
 I think we found our shooter. 
 Bob Lee : Lon Scott. 
 Nadine : CEO of Anhur Dynamics? 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 We've been hiring PMCs to handle off-book black ops. 
 This has "war crimes" written all over it. 
 [speaks foreign language] 
 These so-called... 
 Nadine : Karlina Ordenko is dead. 
 I believe a man named Grigory Krukov gave the order to have her killed. 
 He's a high-ranking member of the FSB. 
 You're a drunk with a security clearance. 
 And you're that asshole who thought he could outsmart me. 
 If we don't start working together... 
 Together? 
 Isaac : You can't stop these guys alone. 
 I want $10 million in uncut diamonds, or I'm going public with the Annex B file, which I have in my possession. 
 [grunts] 
 [groans] 
 God, you're a dumbass. 
 Meachum : Swagger's gone. He's got Annex B. 
 Krukov : Our mutual friends will not be pleased. 
 Good-bye, Mr. Meachum. 
 Is that Daddy? 
 Where... where are you? 
 You let them go, I'll give you that shot you've been hoping for. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 [explosion booms] 
 Julie : We have to find Mary. Some man took her from the back of the van. 
 Krukov has her. I followed them, but I've gone as far as I can go. 
 What do you mean, "as far as you can go"? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 She's in Russia.

 Your name is Mary, yes? 
 I am Grigory. 
 I have a grandson about your age. 
 Sasha. Very sweet boy. 
 Where is he? 
 He's at home with his mother. 
 Are you hungry? 
 I will leave it here. 
 Some cookies and milk. 
 You are frightened, but you have nothing to fear. 
 Your father has something that belongs to us. 
 When he gives it back, you go home. 
 Where's my mommy? 
 Eat. Rest. 
 This will all be over soon. 
 Julie : This is never gonna work. 
 The embassy is a fortress. There's no other way. 
 Then give Krukov what he wants. 
 Honey, if I believed for one second that I could trust that guy, I would. 
 They can't let us live with what we know. 
 Nadine : The ambassador's at a cocktail party at American University. 
 He should be there for another two hours. 
 That should fit. Okay, Julie, you're up first. 
 Your objective is to distract the ambassador and his security team and then get them headed back to the Embassy. 
 Where is he? Where? Where's the ambassador? 
 Someone tell me. Where is he? 
 Woman : What's going on? 
 Man : What? 
 You! This is a private function. 
 I want my daughter. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I know you had her taken. My daughter. 
 She's at your embassy. 
 I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 And don't you dare bullshit me. 
 [speaks Russian] 
 No. Get off of me. 
 Nadine : Isaac will be there to validate the story and motivate the ambassador. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 You think you can strong-arm me, but you can't. 
 I'll go to the press. 
 Excuse me, Ambassador. She came to Homeland first. 
 She was raising hell in our office. 
 Look. I'm truly sorry about your trouble, but I have no idea who you are. 
 I'm Julie Swagger, Bob Lee Swagger's wife. 
 My six-year-old was dragged into your embassy by Grigory Krukov. 
 [people murmuring indistinctly] 
 I'm sorry, Mrs. Swagger, but I have nothing to do with this. 
 [speaks Russian] 
 You're a liar. I'm going to the press. 
 Everyone is gonna know. 
 I'm going to the press with everything! 
 Bob Lee : Once I get into the embassy, how do I find Mary? 
 I have the plans for all three floors right here. 
 It's big, but the public stuff... conference rooms, offices... it's all on the first and second floor. 
 The secret sh1t is in the basement. 
 Any luck with the ambassador's security team? 
 This one. 
 When you get Mary, meet us at the surveillance point at K Street. 
 Once you're all safe, we'll take it from there. 
 Copy. 
 So, K Street, then we're done? 
 You see my wife and kid, you get paid. 
 [dramatic music]

 Let her go. 
 I'm sorry. I do not know what this is about. 
 The scared little six-year-old in the basement. 
 Let her go. 
 Mary Swagger. 
 Who? 
 That's cute. 
 You know who I am. 
 You are the national security advisor. 
 And yet here I am, standing in the Russian embassy. 
 Does that give you any sense of how important this is? 
 Swagger has Annex B. 
 Pick a headline: "Complicated Government Conspiracy" or "Six-Year-Old American Girl Kidnapped by a Russian Spy"? 
 Which one do you think "The Post" will go with? 
 In my country, we do not worry about headlines. 
 This isn't your country. 
 Yes, it is.

 You'll want to get that. 
 It's your ambassador.
