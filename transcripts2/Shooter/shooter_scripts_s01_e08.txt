 Previously on "Shooter"... 
 I'm writing a book about your husband. 
 I don't think he did it. I can help. 
 Ukrainian journalist by the name of Karlina Ordenko has gone missing. 
 I need to talk to her. 
 The micro-drive, so-called Annex B files. 
 I-I can't understand you. 
 Oh, my God, they found me. 
 They found... 
 [screams] 
 Karlina? 
 Karlina Ordenko is dead. 
 I believe a man named Grigory Krukov gave the order to have her killed. He's a high-ranking member of the FSB. [gunshot] O'Brien : You find the other Black Kings, you find your shooter. [gunshot] 1,500 yards. What's that guy's name? Helling : Lon Scott. Nadine : CEO of Anhur Dynamics? The resolution is shitty. It's a cell phone video. My laptop original, it's way better. It's like every page of the complete, un-redacted copy of the Annex B file,  which I also have in my possession. I need you to suspend me. Suspend you? What the hell are you talking about? I need you to trust me on this. He found the shooter. Lon Scott, that's him, right? What the hell are you talking about? No way he'd expose himself. He exposed himself, all right. Bob Lee is headed to Virginia. I'm guessing he's planning a rendezvous. [soft suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Bob Lee : Memphis. Swagger? Hey, thanks for coming. [phone beeps] Woman : [speaking Russian] [speaking Russian] _ Woman : [speaking Russian] All right. All right. Would you just shut up? Just tell him I have the thumb drive. Annex B. My number's not blocked. He has three minutes to call me back. Woman : [speaking Russian] [phone claps] ♪ ♪ [phone vibrating] Yo. Krukov : What do you want, Jack? What, you don't want to talk about the high price of caviar? Krukov : Nyet. Okay, fine. I want $10 million in uncut diamonds for Dimitri's thumb drive. Hello? You know, I can always go to "The Washington Post." Krukov : [chuckles] Right. Uh, look, I don't care where you get 'em. Get 'em from Panama. Get 'em from Putin. [laughs] I don't really give a sh1t. Krukov : It is a complicated request. There are layers. A cake has layers, Grig. Okay? Just... I'll turn my phone on tomorrow at 12:00. You have till 12:03 to call me back with a deal. Nadine : So what do you got so far? Bob Lee : He's got three guard rotations, six in each unit. They rotate at 6:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m. Nobody visits. He never goes anywhere. Look, we need to talk. Then talk. There's a thumb drive. It contains proof, definitive proof of what happens in the Ukraine and why their president was assassinated. They killed Karlina Ordenko trying to find it. It'll clear your name. You heard what I said, right? Yes. You need to find the proof. But if we can't... [scoffs] Lon Scott is sitting on the sequel to Iran-Contra. Whatever happens, we're going to get him. Don't be so sure. The bigger the conspiracy, the bigger the people involved. Then we'll expose them all, all the way to the top, as high as it goes. Okay, Agent Memphis. We'll do it your way. But if it doesn't work, it's back to plan A. Nadine : What's plan A? What do you think? [dramatic music] [phone vibrating] Yeah? Howard : Spoke to my buddy at the FAA. An Anhur private jet took off from Bellingham 60 minutes after Payne was walked out of here. The flight plan had them going to Delaware, but they left controlled airspace when they got to Virginia. Baby, you just got to hang in a couple more days. Heard that before. Bob Lee : You can believe me. We're in field-goal range I promise it's almost over. Julie : Okay. Hey, you remember the old Ranger station? Damn right I do. Okay, settle down. [chuckles] Bob Lee : I need you and Mary to get there as soon as you can. Are we in trouble? Can you slip away quietly? Julie : Yes, definitely. I'll check in as soon as I'm clear of this. Is this really almost over? The hard part will be, and you're not gonna have to look over your shoulder anymore. The rest of it we'll deal with later. All right, babe. I got to go. I love you. Nadine : Okay, Anhur has a private airfield in Langley Falls. It's about 20 minutes from here. Howard : I know, I ran it. They were just issued a diplomatic clearance number It's scheduled to arrive in half an hour. Lon Scott's on the move. I know where he's going. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ So according to my boss at the Bureau, an Anhur private jet took off from Bellingham an hour after Payne got sprung from the Seattle office. Bob Lee : Well, Payne's on Lon Scott's payroll, so that makes sense. ♪ ♪ Nadine : And based on his intel at the FAA, this airfield was just issued a diplomatic clearance on a flight originating from Russia. Bob Lee : All right. Let's see who we get. ♪ ♪  ♪ That's Meachum and... ♪ ♪ That's Grigory Krukov, the FSB officer I mentioned earlier. Full security detail. He's not taking any chances. [car approaches] Where are you going? I'm moving ringside. ♪ ♪  ♪ Krukov : Where is Payne? Meachum : sh1t, did we forget to send him an eVite? Krukov : He wants $10 million for the thumb drive. You screwed up. You pay him. I was tasked with killing the Ukrainian president. Last time I checked, his brains were all over the sidewalk And things have just been as smooth as a minx's  kiska  ever since. Payne knows how to hide. It could take a while to find him. I didn't fly 5,000 miles to be told this. I know the problem. What is your solution? Pay him. Nyet. Grigory, he's got Annex B. Once that gets out, there'll be an investigation, followed by sanctions. Finally, NATO tanks on your border. What the hell are we talking about? Pay him. You could be implicated too, Lon. Anhur is all over that thumb drive. I'm not worried about that. If anything, it'll just enhance our reputation. [scoffs] Plus, it's a big world. I got a lot of money. Meachum : [chuckles] Payne has the Annex B file. He's using it to finance an exit. I'll deal with the Russians. I'll turn up the heat. Red on red. Red on red? Yeah, we'll play them against each other. That's what we did in Afghanistan. How does that get us what we need? We just make sure Payne comes out the other side of it. And let him lead us right to it. [indistinct chatter] You're not hard to find. Who said I was hiding? How the hell can you eat that? It tastes good. What do you want? Bob Lee's here. You might want to stay away from open spaces, windows. I already know he's here. You talked to him. Holy sh1t. You did. Let me guess. He said no. You're reaching. Wasn't a very smart play. Not like you at all. I need a path out. Nobody's stopping you. There's the door. Thanks for playing. Retirement costs money. All right. You want out? There's one last thing you could do for me. Payne's got Annex B. He wants $10 million. Lon said no. He tried the Russians? They won't pay either. Find Payne. Get the thumb drive. I'll fund your IRA. Get me Payne's files from Anhur. Ops, personnel, financials. There's got to be a place he stays, eats, and gets a blow job on a regular basis. I already did that. Yeah? You miss things. Oh. [indistinct chatter] 1140. [knocking] Housekeeping. [zapping] [both grunting] [all grunting] You move, you die. Swagger... [tense music] Don't feel bad. You couldn't know he was already in the room. Special Agent Memphis from Seattle FBI office, Russian Organized Crime Unit, yes? ♪ ♪ If you kill me, she dies. So you may as well drop it, Swagger. ♪ ♪ I know Jack Payne's blackmailing you. Tell him you'll pay him off, and when he comes out of hiding to collect, I'll kill him for you. While I'm at it, I'll kill Meachum and Lon Scott for you too. You are trying to entrap me. She's wearing wire. Show him. ♪ ♪ I'm not with the FBI. I've been suspended. And yet you still have gun. This is America. [chuckles] And now, you two are a team. Yes. So we're all friends here. Yes, we are. ♪ ♪ I survived the fall of communism and three presidents. You know how? Never trusting anyone. ♪ ♪ Call your boss. Ask for State Department file on me, Grigory Krukov. He says no, I believe you. If he provides it, well... ♪ ♪ [phone ringing] Utey. Nadine : This is Special Agent Memphis. I need the State Department file on a Russian diplomat, Grigory Krukov. ♪ ♪ Howard : What's going on? Just need the file, sir. ♪ ♪ Memphis, you were suspended. As you know, your access to FBI files is revoked. Don't call here again. ♪ ♪ Lon Scott, Meachum, and Payne, are you not forgetting someone? Me. I'd like to kill you. But if I do, more Russians keep coming. If I kill them, it's tied off on their side. But... I want what you're giving Payne. What makes you think I want him dead that badly? 'Cause they're amateurs, and you're thinking about it, which means you still get paid even with them dead. I didn't think you were a man that cared about money. I don't. But after the sh1t I've been through, I think I deserve some privacy. I'm thinking a ranch, a couple thousand acres, big fence. Keep my family safe. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Okay, Swagger. You can have the $10 million. ♪ ♪ You kill Meachum, Lon Scott, and Payne, and I get Annex B. Done. The meet has to be at the airport. It's the perfect place for me to shoot. They will be suspicious. Then throw in a getaway plane. ♪ ♪ When heads start popping, you go. But if you don't leave me the money, you're dd before your foot hits the step of your jet. ♪ ♪ You okay? Yeah. Thanks for doing that, bro. Any time, my bro, any time. I'll talk to you. [mellow rock music] ♪ ♪ Oh, hey, buddy. Long time, no see. You're not armed? It's casual Friday. So, what, you tracked me down through my Leavenworth cellmate? I'm impressed. The thumb drive, where is it? You kill me, you'll never find out. [tense music] [gunfire] Hey, it's a rental. [grunting] Next time, it won't just be a muzzle burn. What, kneecaps? Nuts? Word of advice, if I bleed out and die, the Russians are gonna be pissed. I don't give a sh1t about the Russians. Where's the thumb drive? Right. You're still Meachum's errand boy. Well, he can't have it, and neither can you. I die, it flies, and you know I'm right. Bullshit. Look, the Russians just agreed to pay me, okay? You blow it now, they will be on your ass until the end of time. So kill me or please get the hell out of my car. ♪ ♪ Man and woman : ♪ When I go ♪ 
♪ Into that ground ♪ [gunshot] Remember, nice and easy with the breathing. Man and woman : ♪ I won't go quietly ♪ 
♪ I'm bringing my crown ♪ 
♪ When I go ♪ 
♪ Into that ground ♪ [gunshot] Gently pull the trigger. Don't jerk it. Just take your time. Man and woman : ♪ Bury me face down ♪ [gunshot] Man : ♪ From the rubble ♪ 
♪ What do I see? So what if I can't shoot a tin can from 100 yards? The thing's five feet tall. But at 600 yards, it'll look like a can at 100 yards. Man : ♪ I'll never get free ♪ 
♪ Oh, I got troubles ♪

♪ It's only just begun ♪ [crickets chirping] [tense music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Bob Lee : Yo, it's me. Guard shift's about to change, so it's time to go to work. I swapped out the substation fuses with cheaper ones. They'll short out soon. The lights will dip when the generator kicks on, and that's when you tuck in. Wait until you see flames, and then count to five. Propane ignites at 470 degrees, so you got to let it get hot. How do you know this sh1t? I'm a sniper. Remember, this silencer gives you one shot, so if you miss, take it off, but then they're gonna hear you down below. This is insane. This is nothing. Trust me. ♪ ♪ See an ID, please. ♪ ♪ Man : We got a power outage. [speaking indistinctly] ♪ ♪ I'm on it! [sniper rifle fires] [explosion] Got a fire! [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ [indistinct radio chatter] ♪ ♪ I was beginning to wonder if you were gonna come. Turn around. [indistinct radio chatter] You didn't once stop to think, "Wow, this is too easy I can assure you, I'm unarmed. The only way I want to kill you is the only way I imagine you'd like to kill me. On a long gun. There's a meeting. Krukov called for it to pay off Payne. Yeah, I'm not going. I think it's a set-up. You're right. It is a set-up. Krukov : Okay, Swagger. You can have the $10 million. You kill Meachum, Lon Scott, and Payne. ♪ ♪ So why am I still alive? I could've taken you out two days ago at the hangar when your guards left you exposed. They didn't cover you on your morning run around the grounds. Hmm. If I thought you matter, you'd already be dead. But you're just a cog in the Russians' wheel. It's them I want. So why didn't you kill them when you had the chance? I was outgunned. Yeah? Should've done your reconnaissance. I did my reconnaissance on you. You were the Oregon Junior Rifle Champion three years in a row. You were making shots most shooters in the adult competition couldn't make. But then, at 18, you lost. You didn't even crack the final round. I assume the death of your father earlier that year had an adverse effect on you. Fathers have a way of screwing up their sons. Hmm. They sure do. ♪ ♪ I don't remember the pain. How about you? Yeah, I remember it. You know, my accident happened before I got a chance to serve my country. I serve it now, though. For years, I wanted to be as good as you. But we both know I'm better now. ♪ ♪ Yeah, the shot that killed the Ukrainian president was a good one, even with your special red bullet. [chuckles] But try making it when you got grenades landing all around you, command screaming in your ear, and your buddy's bleeding out 20 feet away. I'm the sniper. You're just a... marksman. ♪ ♪ You shoot pumpkins. Come to the meet and watch a real sniper work. You'll see the difference. There you go. I got your bag. I'll see you in a second. Take it. It's not much. I can't. [exhales sharply] Stop. What are you gonna do if things don't pan out the way Bob Lee says? Please, I swore I'd take care of you. You already have. Where are you going? You can't say, can you? You can't say when you'll call or when I'll see you ain. Hey, I'll reach out to you when we're safe. I promise. You remember when I used to sneak out to Tommy O'Leary's house? And what has that got to do with anything? You've always covered for me my whole life, no matter what. I need you to do it this one last time. But, Anne, you can't trust anyone, no one. [light instrumental music] Mary, come say good-bye, honey. Bye, Auntie Anne. Oh, good-bye, sweetheart. You be a good girl, and you take care of your mommy for me. Okay? Mm-hmm. Come on. Okay. ♪ ♪ Uh-huh. Goddamn, Payne. Nothing you need to worry about. Just do what you can to shut Payne up. Who was that? Like I don't have enough problems. Now, I hear you've changed your mind. Lon Scott : They hired Swagger to kill us. Now he's gonna kill them instead. Meachum : You arranged this with Swagger. What makes you think he isn't gonna pop you too while he's at it? He will. He'll try. But it's worth the risk in order to get my shot at him. He kills the Russians, he kills the deal. You'll be able to make a new deal with whoever Krukov's replacement is. [scoffs] Hey, Porter, here to get your second Pulitzer? [scoffs] [knocking] Hi. Can I speak to Julie? She's busy right now. Simon Porter. She knows me. I just said she's busy right now. It's very important that I speak to her. You've got one second to get your foot out of my door before I break it. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [phone vibrating] What do you want, Porter? Julie Swagger's gone. I'll have someone there within the hour. Do exactly as they say. ♪ ♪ [engine revving] All right, you should be good to go. Okay, so everyone arrives. Then what? Then I'm gonna light the fuse. Speak English. Bob Lee : Create chaos and get them questioning each other. Red on red. There'll be no innocents in that hangar today. Like I told you, if all goes well, all you'll have to do is spot. But if some sh1t goes wrong, you keep Payne alive until we get the evidence. Copy? Copy. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Isaac? This is some Deep Throat sh1t. The situation has grown untenable. No kidding. Swagger approached me with a deal. Let me guess. He gets to kill everyone. In exchange, you leave him alone. He wants his life back. After Swagger has killed Lon Scott, Meachum, and Payne, I'd like you to kill him. Why the hell would I trust you? Because our interests are aligned. All right. After it's done and Bob Lee is dead, you get on a plane with Annex B, and you go. But you leave the diamonds. Of course. How will you do it? That's not your problem. ♪ ♪ Anne, this is Carlos. He's an attorney at our publisher's. Good morning, Ms. Murphy. Simon : Anne, we have a formal offer of $500,000 for exclusive rights to Julie and Bob Lee's story. I know Julie's gone. Can we please come in and talk it over? I know she needs the money. You have a beautiful home. Let's just get this over with. We are delighted to present this offer to you. Take your time. Read it carefully. It's a very generous offer. If my sister said no, she probably won't change her mind. Well, if it's in her best interest, maybe she should.
