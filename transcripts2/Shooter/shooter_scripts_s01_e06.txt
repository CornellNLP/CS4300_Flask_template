 Previously on "Shooter." 
 We'll have intel and assistance from the CIA on this mission Mr. Meachum? 
 Happy to be here. 
 Payne : Meachum wants any loose ends sewn up. 
 Payne : You got the rose and you didn't even say anything. 
 Julie : His name is Jack Payne, Meachum : You're with me until this is over. It is over. This thing just blew up in our faces. It hasn't even gotten bad yet. Hey, Nadine... I heard you wanted to see me. That bullet that you brought didn't come from us. Where do you get the materials, though? We got a guy that makes that stuff for us, crazy old kook up in Idaho. O'Brien, that's the name of the guy who sold us the polymer. Rathford? Joey : Yeah, you know him?

Look how pretty he looks. Look how pretty I look. [laughter] My favorite flower, can you guess? It's a Mary Rose. [giggles] In we go. All right, kitten mouse. Take good care of your mommy, okay? Semper Fi. Semper Fi is right, sweet girl. Daddy loves you, and I'm gonna see you real soon, okay? Love you, Daddy. I love you too. It's all I could get. You really think his address is in those? A recollection of O'Brien, he hated technology. So if he's selling his bullets, he's doing it old-school. Yeah. Something wrong? I don't want to ruin our wonderful day. It's just, um... Donny's mom's missing. It's Isaac. I had that b*st*rd in my sights. I could... I'm sorry. No more secret meetings, babe. I love seeing you guys, but I don't want to risk it. I understand. I love you. Love you too. [engine turns over] [door shuts] [footsteps] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Uh-oh, she brought out the folder. Remember him? Dimitri Voydian? One day you roll him up. Next day, he's found in pieces. Voydian's crew, murdered. Kyle Timmons, apparent suicide. Susan Fenn, vanished. ♪ ♪ No, that one's not you. You like the attention. It's not the first time you're seeing these crime scenes, is it? You're right. I do like the attention. But Russian, Russian, some drunk guy who couldn't handle fame? [chuckles] No way, I've read about these. They're some kind of a hangover cure, right? Does the FBI know you have a drinking problem? [chuckles] The evidence is piling up, Jack. We're getting closer. Nix : Smart to bring us in. [knocking] If it looks that way, you should have done it sooner. Meachum : You got some balls on you, don't you? And that's good, 'cause you're gonna need them when you go after Swagger. You must be the guy who lost Swagger in Spokane. Who the hell is this? We'll take care of it. Quickly, please. What am I doing here? Payne is being interrogated by Agent Memphis. If she knows about Payne, she knows about me. Maybe even you. Exactly. Make sure he doesn't say anything stupid. Nadine : You sure you don't want to cop to these? [scoffs] Figured as much. Nadine : Well, you think you're here on goodwill to clear your name, only we have evidence that you operated falsely as a DHS agent. Means we can hold you for 72 hours longer than that once you're formally charged. So you got me. But if I'm not DHS, what am I? You were on the detail to protect the Ukrainian president. Did a sh1t job of that one. I guess that makes two of us. And before that, you posed as a federal agent and apprehended Dimitri Voydian, who had information directly linked to the assassination. Allegedly. Nadine : Either way... the only constant throughout all this mess? You. See, for a second there, I thought you were gonna say Bob Lee Swagger. How is he, by the way? Swagger's dead. Payne : Right, right. Of course, so is Cassie McMahon. You really think saying her name is gonna hurt me? You know, I've lived with that mistake since the day I pulled the trigger. Unlike you, I actually feel things. You mentioned... when you tried to kill me... that I didn't have what your bosses want. So... What is it? Like the saying goes, I'd tell you, but... [chuckles] Pretty soon, Jack, we're never gonna see each other again. Whatever this is, it's gonna be over. [groans] Memphis, let go. Annex B. Let him go. You heard me. Payne is a sociopath, but I think he likes me. I was trying to shake him up. Well, it looks like you did. Run "Annex B" through the CIC. Payne is acting clever, but he might make a mistake. Oh, and do me a favor. Don't kill anybody in my interrogation room. Keep at it. [country music playing] Man : Can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for Sergeant Major Rathford O'Brien. You know where I can find him? He's an old instructor of mine, and I wanted to pay him a visit. You served, huh? Yes, sir, Marine Corps. Those boys in the 82nd know how to brawl. Is that your outfit? Yeah. 82nd saved our backs a time or two. [chuckles] All right... O'Brien's a few miles up the road. Just hang a right past the wooden bridge. You'll reach a fence to private property. And he's up the hill, but God only knows where. Thank you, sir. Son... He don't like company. ♪ ["What Went Down" by Foals] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I buried my heart in a hole in the ground ♪

♪ You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye ♪ [music fading] [gun clicks] I ain't afraid to play God, boy. I'm Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger, Sniper Class 02-1. I could give two sh1ts about Sniper Class 02-1 or Bob Lee Swagger. We need to talk about your bullet. Bob : Sergeant Major... O'Brien : I reckon the person with the rifle is gonna dictate this conversation. Where'd you find this? It was used to assassinate the Ukrainian president. Really? So you come up here thinking it's my bullet so I must be the shooter? Or that you sold it to the person that took the shot. I hate to break it to you, pork. That ain't my bullet. First prototypes were sturdy like that. O'Brien : Then I realized the only way to make a perfect bullet more perfect is if it was untraceable after it was fired. Mine splinter on impact. If it was mine and they used it, there wouldn't be any of it left. O'Brien : What's your interest in it? Bob : They set me up. They framed me for the assassination. Let me guess. A friend said he needed help. And you didn't see that ambush coming a mile away? I taught you better than that. So you do remember me? O'Brien : Yeah, yeah, yeah. You weren't a half-bad shot, even though you were an annoying little sh1t, always looking for a pat on the head. How'd you connect that bullet to me? Tree of Liberty. The Tree... oh, yeah. O'Brien : Had to raise some fast cash. Those Spokane boys, they needed help, and their cash was as green as anybody's. God damn Navy Squeal couldn't shoot for sh1t anyway. You can keep making jokes, but a knockoff version of your bullet was used on a head shot at 1,500 yards. So whoever reverse-engineered it did something right. 1,500, huh? You want to learn how to find the shooter? Get rid of your sh1t. [machine beeps] What's wrong, Mommy? Uh... nothing. Hey, come on, let's go. [ominous music] Are you hungry? Yeah. You want to go eat? Yeah? Hey, Julie, so how's it feel knowing you went on TV and still no one thinks your husband is innocent? Hey, do you know what your daddy did, sweet... No, no, walk away now. You don't like the attention? Maybe you shouldn't have married a murderer. Hey, she's not interested, okay? Mrs. Swagger, if I could just have a minute of your time. I'm with my daughter. I'm writing a book about your husband. Not interested. I don't think he did it. My publisher will pay top dollar, six figures. I know that this is not what this is about, but it's got to be hard being the wife of the man that everybody believes took a shot at the president. I can help. I said I'm not interested. [engine turns over] Nadine : You sure you don't want to cop to these? Figured as much. Well, you think you're here on goodwill to clear your name, only we have evidence you operated falsely as a DHS agent, means we can hold you for 72 hours. Payne : So you got me. But if I'm not DHS, then what am I? Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting? No, it's fine. It's time to talk. I know Payne was working with you. He's part of Homeland. Like you've never been assigned an agent who turned out to be bad news, hm? I barely knew the guy. Yeah. I'm just trying to wrap my head around this whole thing. [scoffs] We all are. You ever hear of Annex B? No, what is it? I have no idea. I can't seem to find it in any of the federal databases. Must be above my clearance. Or it's bullshit. Well, maybe you'll have better luck. Payne is talking about something called Annex B. Meachum : Goddamn Payne. What is it? I'm the one in the open. Meachum : Nothing you need to worry about. Just do what you can to shut Payne up. I know you didn't just walk in uninvited. Isaac, holy sh1t. You didn't say you were coming over. Oh, you pick up a battalion command, now suddenly I got to announce myself? Yeah, you do. I'm guarding the nation's secrets. All you guard is the president. Good to see you, brother. Good to see you too, man. It's been a minute, huh? Yeah. How's that mess in Seattle? Got Flashlight on the plane in one piece. Just got to clean up now. You're a long way from Brooklyn. We're both a long way from Brooklyn now. Look at you, Pendo 5. You didn't come here just to congratulate me. What do you need? I've known that look since the fourth grade when you punched Andre Jones in the nose, and you wanted me... you wanted me to tell Mrs. Francis you were with me the whole time. [laughs] You got a good memory. It's a good shot. Yeah. I need to get access to the SCIF to get some intel. Before you say anything, I know it could put you in a bad spot, but I wouldn't be here if it weren't something big or something I couldn't do myself. Messes with clearances, man. Demotion, early retirement, those are best-case scenarios if sh1t goes south. I know. It's a lot to ask. But you're asking anyway. You did good for yourself, man. I'm happy for you. Isaac. Hold up. Denise. Isaac, leave your phone. Thanks. [electronic beeping] [electronic trilling] 
 
 Hey, Justin. You're not even gonna ask me what this is about? Should I? What are we doing up here? We're gonna stare out over the hills and recite poetry to each other. What the hell does it look like, pork? Jesus Christ. Open that up. Bob : sh1t. What the hell is this? That's a Black King. And doing get any ideas; she's mine. Give me that scope. Well, go on, set it up. Find the target, let's go. 1,550 yards out. Yeah, rifle zeroed. Winds at 9, 10 miles an hour. [rifle clicks] [rifle blast] [laughing] Oh, you got to be kidding me. You're like 5 feet high. I mean, holy sh1t. I saw a guy fire your bullet. It didn't sail like that. Yeah, just 'cause he had my bullet doesn't mean he knew how to use it. That feel like 220 grain to you? It's 400. Good, you're not completely stupid. Take another shot. [rifle clicks] Come on, leg out and down, pork. I have a titanium hip. And I got a 5-inch dick. You don't hear me bragging about it... let's go. [rifle blast] I don't know who to feel sorry for, you for missing 2 feet from center, or me for not teaching you how to shoot properly. [spent shell clinks] [rifle clicks] [exhales sharply] [rifle blast] [faint clang] Well, all right, then. That rifle and my bullet is rated at a quarter MOA. If your shooter had that and even a knockoff version of my bullet, he'd be good for at least 1,800 yards out, maybe farther if the conditions were right. Put another one in there, and listen up. There are four rifles in the world that are strong enough to fire a bullet like this one. And that's one of them right there. You find the other Black Kings, you find your shooter. Hey, quick, quick, shoot that bird. Give me the goddamn thing. [rifle blast] [laughs] I buy, you fly. Well, go get it. Bring the bird back to the cabin. What do you mean? That hike will take me an hour. Well, it's a good thing you got that new titanium hip in there. Got your bird. You can excuse yourself whenever you're ready. Where are you going? I've got my business to attend to. You can go on about yours. You said find the other Black Kings, you find the shooter. Yeah, what, do you need me to spell it out for you? But you still would have needed somebody who was a damn good shot. Single mile head shot with a variety of variables? Yeah, you'd have to be pretty damn good. Well, then, who else would have the other Black Kings that could make that shot? You got to know people. I must look like a walking encyclopedia to you. No, more like a lonely asshole whose life revolves around long guns and bullets. You watch it, boy. You might not have people in your life you care about anymore, but I do, and right now they're suffering because of me. Man, I actually used to look up to you. Now I really know you're a fool. I don't know anyone else who could've taken that shot besides you or me, and that's all I got for you, pork. I'm not leaving until I get an answer. Well, if you're gonna stick around, make yourself useful and clean the damn bird. You should see the look on your face. You hate me. You probably get that a lot. That's true. I mean, sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be on the other side of that. That's because you're a sociopath. We're more alike than you think. We both act first, ask questions later. We both get sh1t on by our bosses. Nah. We're two peas in a pod, you and me. I'm curious, Jack. Have you ever felt something for anyone? Yeah, sure. Right up until the meter runs out. No, no. I'm talking about that feeling... when you can't stop thinking about a person. Sometimes you bother them because you want to see if they'll react to you. What is it about me, Jack? Do I remind you of your mother? Face it. You do feel something for someone... me. You want to help me. Otherwise you wouldn't have given me Annex B. [sighs] Look, I shouldn't be telling you this, but, eh, what the hell. Hugh Meachum. Who's Hugh Meachum? He's the one that got away, or "getting away" might be a better way to put it. [phone trilling] Isaac, where the hell are you? Look, we interviewed those militia idiots. Looks like our boy found the bullet. We're rolling. All right, Isaac, any longer, and people are gonna start asking questions. [gunfire on video] What is it? Annex B. It's not a file; it's a program. Isaac : It's rated special access. I don't recognize those uniforms. Private military. There's a bunch of documents as well. A lot of it's redacted. Looks like we've been hiring PMCs to handle off-book black ops. That's unconstitutional. Yeah. [keys clacking] Night raids. Anhur Dynamics. We should not be looking at this. This has war crimes written all over it. You involved in this? [computer beeping] Oh, sh1t. Somebody's filed something into this. They shut us down. What'd you get me mixed up in? Calm down. If anyone asks, I stole your credentials and coerced you. You understand? Do you even have a plan? I keep telling myself I do. Didn't you have a wife and son? Where are they? You know, I signed up in '69. I lied about my age 'cause I didn't want to miss out on the action. My dad and his buddies, they served. All seemed like heroes to me. Infantry to sniper school to the jungle, just like that. Killed my first VC when I was 17. 612 yards in the rain, I'll never forget it. After that... they started falling so fast, I just lost track. I stopped killing for my country or my friends. I was killing for me. Married a great girl two years after I got back stateside. My boy was born two years later. You know, I tried to shake it, let all that go. But never could. Thought that if I taught it, maybe it would lose its power. But never did. Took a discharge. Just... drifted. I lost my bearings. Not long after that, I lost my wife, I lost my boy. Sorry to hear that. It's the way of the gun, pork. Stupid, really. Man on radio : Sergeant Major, you've got a problem. What the hell you hollering about? You're fixing to have more company. Multiple armored vehicles rolling in. Roger that. Yeah, so I had a heads-up you were coming. Who we looking at? My guess, ex-military. Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll be Air Force. No, didn't think so. Let's get ready. [suspenseful music] All right, pull that back till it locks, and then set this. Got it. [crossbow winding] You sure you ready for this? Yeah, just keep your head on a swivel. O'Brien : And when things go south... Long guns at the top of the hill. Checkpoint Foxtrot, that's the signal. Hey, try not to shoot me. Don't get in my way. Yeah. Why would Payne just give him up? To save his own ass. My guess is that Hugh Meachum is the guy pulling the strings. Hugh Meachum is listed in the government directory under DoD. That only happens when people aren't supposed to know what you really do. My guess is, he's a spy. That's the rumor, anyway. On my side of the building... titles aren't important. Let me guess, CIA? Usually it takes days for a request for interrogation materials to be processed. What can I say? It's one of the benefits of being in my shoes. Things tend to get expedited. We haven't processed any requests. You have a deranged man in custody trying to drag me into things. Word gets around. Nadine : Payne seems pretty convinced you're the guy with the answers. What Agent Memphis meant to ask was, maybe you can tell us what the hell is going on. I have no idea. I'm only allowed to operate outside the U.S. I just came to tell you I did a few missions with Mr. Payne, and he was found to be unfit for duty, so we let him go. Everything you need is in that file. Was Annex B part of that mission? [chuckles nervously] I'll give you two answers. One, I don't know. If I did, I wouldn't tell you. [laughs] Take your pick. Your job must be difficult. I imagine the cover-up is the hardest part. It's not the hardest part. Believe me. Well, I think Annex B is tied to the assassination, and I think you know it. [chuckles] And I think you're reaching. As S.A.C., you ought to know, this office is getting a reputation, and it's not one I think you want. Hey, we're supposed to be on the same team, remember? I think I'm about done hearing from a girl stupid enough to get caught in a press conference. Hey, asshole, this is Special Agent Memphis, and when you're in my office, you will address her with respect. [chuckles] It goes both ways, Jack.
