 BOB LEE: Previously, on "Shooter..." 
 So you're not gonna shut them down? 
 For what? All we got are a couple of unregistered firearms and an illegal fighting ring. 
 Bob Lee had that photo of Semtex. 
 It wasn't there. The torches were empty. 
 Go, before he comes back. 
 I'd wish you luck but I wouldn't mean it. 
 Same here. 
 You won't do this. 
 This is what you want. There's a yellow hard drive with all Atlas' plans, not just the one that concerns the card. 
 Must be Atlas operations HQ, where they keep the files on all their missions and operatives. 
 Got it. My dad's file. 
 WOMAN: Please state your phone identification. 
 RAY: Ray Brooks, Operation Windmill. 
 BOB LEE: Brooks killed my father, I'm gonna kill him. 
 We gotta go, now. 
 ISAAC: We gotta get that drive. 
 What's the final check on absolute power in government? 
 The Supreme Court. They're split 4-4. 
 NADINE: Atlas is trying to tip the balance. 
 Why don't you and your men take up defense positions? 
 This is my team, Brooks. 
 Well, you know what they say, Swagger. 
 Three people can keep a secret if two are dead. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, our next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Ray Brooks. 
 EARL: Whatever it is they're planning, it won't end until someone stops them. 
 Are those listening devices? Yes. 
 We're not safe here anymore. 
 EARL: You shouldn't have had to see your old man like that. 
 You don't treat people that way, especially your wife. 
 You hear me? 
 ♪ I been dealing with some stuff, lately. 
 That's probably why I've been so hard on you. 
 Can I help? 
 No. 
 ♪ JULIE: Don't come home. 
 Not until you're ready to stay. 
 You know, there are a lot of ways that you're like your dad. 
 There's plenty of ways that you're not. 
 BROWN: Go, Bob, go. 
 YOUNG BOB LEE: It was my fault! 
 Let's go! Go! No!

 [SIGHS] 
 There had to have been more than a dozen Atlas recruits at the campus. You only brought three? 
 They weren't exactly lining up to be taken in. 
 Anything on those files we salvaged? 
 Personnel records, descriptions of training exercises. 
 Not enough to indict Atlas, especially now that the campus no longer exists. 
 You can thank our leader for that. 
 [SIGHS] We need these guys to talk. 
 Leave it up to me. They're trained. 
 You can't just beat the information out of them.

 That's the plan, right? 
 Torture us for intel? Not exactly. 
 But that option's still on the table.

 So what do you want with me? 
 To offer you a job. 
 I'm already employed. Really? 
 Have you seen your old workplace lately? 
 Atlas as you know it is over. 
 This is some kind of test, right? 
 Russo looking through that camera? 
 Russo's dead. 
 We're the new management. 
 Why me? You tell us. 
 We know Atlas is planning an attack on D.C. 
 You give us the information to help stop it, you get to work for us. 
 And if I don't? 
 Atlas likes to have leverage over its members. 
 Pretty sure there's things in there that you want to keep a secret. 
 ♪ I'm just a recruit. 
 I don't get intel on ops. 
 Then tell us where to find it. 
 Every operation is siloed. 
 The only people on the planet who know the details of the mission are the ones who order it... 
 And the person executing it. 
 The order would have to be relayed somehow. 
 We haven't found any trace of it. 
 Then it's tier-one. 
 Means everything's face-to-face. 
 Tell us how these tier-one missions work. 
 If this is a job interview, I believe this is where we would discuss compensation. 
 Name your price.

 Good thing we'll have you as a tie-breaker. 
 If I can get that far. 
 First they come at me with Earl Swagger's affidavit. 
 Now his son... is marking me. 
 Well, then maybe instead of measuring drapes in your new office, you should go to your hotel where I can protect you. 
 That sounds like an order. 
 Well, it's not a suggestion. 
 Red, I don't answer to you. 
 Russo and Gold may be dead, but don't expect me to call you "sir." 
 There are more things at stake here than ego. 
 Your being on that bench dictating the law of the land in this country, that's the only thing that keeps us protected. 
 Keeps Atlas on the right side of history. 
 Then do your job. 
 Put Swagger down. 
 I am dealing with that situation as I see fit. 
 If I didn't know better, I'd say you lost the stomach for killing. 
 Maybe that's what happens to a man after he buries his son. 
 The campus is gone... and the days of crazed gunmen like Solotov running around on behalf of Atlas are over. 
 Soft power. 
 Second and third order effects.
