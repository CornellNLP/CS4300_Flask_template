 I'm sorry about your husband, Mrs. Thwaite. 
 Let's put the past behind us, Mrs. Gaunt. 
 Let's show the world what can be done when two women reason together. 
 _ 
 Do you like parties, Martha? 
 You need to go get your sister away from that man. 
 He's in league with the devil. I mean, really he is. 
 How did you two end up working together? 
 We're not with the No-Name League. 
 Next you'll tell me you're not spying on them for the CIA. 
 What do you want, Crowley? I want your soul, of course. 
 Thomas, will you please tell us what happened? 
 We were never there. You understand? 
 My God. James. 
 Hello, Frances. 
 I thought you were dead. 
 When the time is right, I shall reveal myself publicly. 
 And then I will destroy my enemies and lead this country back to greatness. 
 The Raven Society is on the cusp of a new dawn. 
 It'll shock the world. 
 Are you with me?! 
 Yes, yes, yes! 
 Will you marry me? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I will. 
 Esme! 
 Captain Curzon, he has been waiting, waiting all this time to pay me back. 
 Anything? 
 I don't even know his first name. 
 Just clean his house, that's all. 
 Have you any idea where he's gone? 
 You're supposed to be dead. Well, I'm not. 
 How's your mum? 
 All right. 
 I like your mum. 
 Why aren't you dead? 
 It's a good trick, eh? 
 I'd tell you how, but I'd have to implicate other parties, so I'll say nowt. 
 Tell me why I shouldn't give the old bill a shout. 
 Why would you? 
 I've done nothing to you. 
 Recently. 
 Why are you here? 
 How did you know about Curzon? 
 I've got important friends, me. 
 And you're the talk of the town, you two. 
 Why? Curzon's a nobody. 
 Nobody's nobody. 
 Why'd he kill Esme? 
 To get at me. 
 Revenge. He thinks I disrespected him. 
 Oh, I see. 
 It were your fault, then. 
 Thought as much. 
 Why else would anyone hurt such a lovely, innocent lass like her? 
 What did you do to disrespect him? 
 What's any of this got to do with you? 
 I just want justice for Esme, same as you. 
 I loved her. 
 You barely knew her. 
 She was my fiancée. 
 I dare say you were very fond of her. 
 A man's love's not the same, though, is it? 
 You've less feeling in you. 
 Any road, our lad's away, pointing no fingers. 
 We have to catch the bugger again. 
 Best team up, eh? 
 I'm gonna go now. 
 Have I done somewhat to offend you somehow? 
 No. You're mad, that's all. 
 Don't be like that. 
 We could help each other. 
 Good-bye. He weren't alone. 
 He were with a woman. 
 How do you know that? 
 I were there. 
 Came to see Esme. 
 They got to the door first. 
 Well, what did this woman look like? 
 Older lady. 
 Dark hair, I think. 
 She were wrapped up. 
 They let 'emselves in so quick I couldn't get a proper look. 
 I could've stopped 'em if I'd known. 
 They let themselves in? 
 Wh... Th-They had keys? 
 Big ring of 'em. 
 Where you going? 
 The keys, they gave you a clue, didn't they? 
 Tell. 
 No. 
 I'm coming with you, Sherlock. 
 No. You're not. 
 If you loved Esme as much as I do... you won't deny me. 
 You'll know how much this means to me. 
 _ 
 For f*ck's sake, why'd you do that? 
 Emotions got the better of me. Sorry. 
 Walk away. 
 Now, let's have a look. 
 Oh, it's not too bad. 
 Now let's start again, shall we? 
 You gave over the keys. Why? 
 W-We do it all the time. 
 There are other flats in the building to be let. 
 He looked like a respectable buyer. 
 It-it's normal procedure. 
 When you heard about Esme's murder, why didn't you say anything to the police? 
 I called the police immediately! 
 T-Two detectives came, and I gave them a full description of the man and-and all the relevant paperwork. Look, I swear. 
 The police knew. 
 Coppers. 
 Bent as Judas, the lot of 'em. 
 Leave me alone now, would you? 
 Don't take your grump out on me, duck. 
 I'm not the enemy. 
 What we gonna do now? 
 We never see each other again. 
 There's a telephone number you can call for information about bloody trains and parking. 
 Is this too much? Hmm? 
 Oh, uh, no. It's very fetching, ma'am. 
 But this... No. 
 No. I think it's too much. 
 Ma'am, this is a serious problem. 
 None of these secret political societies have ever dared show their faces in public before. 
 This is a brazen show of disrespect. 
 _ What a dreary poster. 
 How on earth does Mrs. Gaunt expect to draw a crowd? 
 Mm, there'll be a crowd. 
 A mob. Screaming for blood. 
 Or a general election, at least, which would come to the same thing. 
 A hung parliament, martial law, blood and anarchy, ma'am. 
 You should write plays, Prime Minister. So dramatic. 
 No. 
 No, it won't do. 
 I do not exaggerate. 
 Anarchy. 
 The whole country will be watching to see how we respond. 
 We don't oppose order or strength or new dawns, do we? 
 I don't understand what it is they want. 
 Ooh, they're not Republicans, are they? 
 Oh, Lord, no. 
 No, traditional English fascists. 
 Smart black uniforms, thrash Johnny Foreigner, hang free thinkers sort of thing. Childish stuff, but they're willing to destroy half the country to get what they want. 
 A national cleansing in blood would be just the ticket. 
 But under Royal authority. 
 Yes, of course. 
 But you'd have to follow their orders or be forced into abdication. 
 The Duke of Windermere would be very happy to take your place. I believe I told you we shan't ever speak of my wretched uncle. 
 As you say, madam. 
 Nevertheless... Absurd. 
 The people would never stand for it. 
 Mustard and coral, have you gone stark mad, woman? 
 I want your permission to use the harshest available methods to crush this rally. 
 Water cannon and rubber bullets, deployed with brisk discretion. 
 Perhaps one or two snipers in reserve. 
 Won't that make me look awfully oppressive? 
 Can't we just send in those lovely horses? 
 Isn't that the usual style? 
 Well, we shall do that, of course. 
 But we must do more. 
 In times of strife, the people need to see and feel the firm guidance of Your Majesty's government. No. 
 I won't be goaded into brutality. 
 Horses and truncheons only. 
 No rubber bullets. No cannon, no snipers. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 If I may... That's all. 
 _ 
 A public rally? 
 We had a pact. 
 I thought we understood each other. 
 Why is she doing this? 
 Puzzling. 
 What can she say or do at a public rally that warrants the risk of arrest? I don't know. 
 A reckless mistake, perhaps. 
 You should be guardedly happy, my dear. 
 Well, she exposes herself, she exposes us. 
 We have to respond with our own counterprotest, or the No-Name League will look weak. 
 I will look weak. 
 If Mrs. Gaunt wants to bare her neck, don't stop her. 
 Let the police do your work for you. 
 Do nothing, you mean? 
 If you sit down by the riverbank and wait long enough, the corpses of your enemies float past. 
 Chinese proverb. 
 We're not in China. 
 Of course. 
 I'm just a loyal advisor. 
 You're the leader. 
 You must decide. 
 Big rally tomorrow in the park. 
 Stand up for your country and take part. 
 Say no to peace and say yes to battle. Eh? 
 Are we not men? 
 Shut it, Adolf. The game's on. 
 Oi, you! Off the furniture! Sharpish. 
 We are talking about the future of England. 
 f*ck off! 
 Commie drunkards. 
 You call yourself English? 
 f*cking liberty. 
 You're ruinin' the f*cking football, eh? 
 f*ck off. 
 Do you want some? Lads. Lads! 
 Go on, then. Do something. 
 You know, I don't get politics. 
 You're born, you're f*cked, you die. 
 That's the name of this ship. 
 Why worry which fucker's on the bridge? 
 Alfie boy. 
 Night of the murder, Curzon had a woman with him. 
 Description sounds like that charlady, Mrs. Pike. 
 What description? How do you know that? 
 Long story. 
 We need to track her down. 
 No problem. Ready. 
 Well, finish your pint. Let's go. 
 What, now? 
 What, we're-we're tracking her down now? This minute? 
 You're gonna track her down. I've got other business. 
 What business? 
 The police f*cked Esme's murder investigation. 
 It was a cover-up. Why? 
 Don't know. I'm going to ask a policeman. 
 You two, find Pike. 
 Goddamn it. 
 You're nervous. 
 Of course I am. 
 I haven't the faintest doubt that you'll be marvelous, your speech will be spellbinding, and the rally will be a great success. 
 Yes. 
 Or the Tower. 
 Success. Destiny. 
 Well and good. 
 A success. 
 What then, Jimmy? 
 Well, I think I'll start by personally castrating the prime minister and all his cronies. 
 Then I'll put them out to starve in the Aldgate gibbet. 
 Jolly well deserved, I'm sure. 
 But wouldn't mercy look more statesmanlike, though, to the people at large? The people... love ferocity, and they love a spectacle. 
 I'll give them both. 
 Christ. 
 It's all a bit daunting, isn't it? 
 I mean, we're-we're starting a civil war. 
 Steel yourself, Frances. 
 Make no mistake, I come with a rod of correction. 
 There must be bloodshed. 
 There must be pain. 
 That is how a new and stronger nation is forged. 
 Egg and omelets, old girl. 
 You know that. 
 Yes. Yes, you're right, of course. 
 Sorry. Just a... touch of the old butterflies. 
 We shall fight... and win. 
 What if the queen... refuses to accept our victory? 
 Well... we'll reason with her. 
 She'll do the right thing. 
 Wh-What if she doesn't? 
 Then she knows that her uncle is waiting in the Bahamas, anxious to come home. 
 The pretender? Never. 
 Never? 
 Do you think? A coward who fled the war, practically a traitor? 
 Trifle harsh. He's no Alexander, but... 
 He's married to an American divorcée, and he wears jewelry. 
 How can we talk about restoring virtue and allow such a man on the throne? 
 Perhaps you're right. 
 No. You are right. 
 No doubt. 
 In any case... the mere threat of the man is useful to us, don't you see? 
 The queen doesn't know we won't countenance the man. 
 Here am I, talking about the queen's business. 
 Absurd. 
 I can hardly write a decent sentence. 
 Terrible habit. 
 Smoking? Sneaking up on people. 
 It's uncivilized. 
 Hard to break old habits. 
 And it strongly suggests this conversation will not be amiable. 
 That's your guilty conscience talking. 
 Conscience? You flatter me. 
 You know why I'm here. 
 Not the faintest, old chap. 
 You... and by "you," I mean the police... you knew who killed Esme, and you covered it up. 
 A very serious accusation. 
 Skip the bollocks. Talk. 
 Supposing what you say is true. 
 I wasn't on Esme's case... why do you assume I know anything about it? 
 You know everything. It's your job. 
 Flattery again. 
 I'm not happy, Mr. Aziz. 
 I'm not happy at all. 
 Was you to play ignorant, I can't be responsible for my actions. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 Yeah. I am. 
 Just wanted to be clear on that point. 
 I'd hate to capitulate too early. 
 Uh, bravo on cracking the case, by the way, someday you must tell me how you did it. 
 It's the usual sordid story. 
 Esme's killer, Mr. Curzon, is the b*st*rd son of a very important man. 
 A lord, in fact. 
 Favors were called in; the case was scuppered. 
 What lord? Give me a name. 
 Oh. 
 That's more than my life's worth. 
 Literally. 
 Cut my throat, if you must. 
 Tell me where Curzon is now. 
 I don't know. 
 Like I said, Mr. Aziz, I'm not happy. 
 I'll make trouble. 
 Bulls in china shops ain't in it. I don't know where your man is. 
 I expect I could find out, though, if you gave me some time. 
 I haven't got time. 
 You could put the Sweeney onto me as soon as I walk out there. 
 Yes, I could do that. 
 You'll have to trust me. 
 You got 24 hours. 
 Well, I'd better get onto it, then. 
 Now, how should I reach you? 
 f*ck. 
 If you ask me, they're all bloody lunatics. 
 Ravens, indeed. They're crows, more like. 
 Disgruntled crows. You give them their head, they'll have us back at war in a trice, never mind who with. Hear, hear. 
 I hope you're gonna give 'em a bloody good thrashing at this wretched rally. 
 Don't you worry, we'll show them what's what. 
 Rather them than that wretched No-Name League, eh? 
 Hmm. 
 At least the Ravens have proper respect for rank... and blood. 
 A plague on both their houses. 
 What's the matter with just muddling along together as we always have done? 
 Hear, hear. Built an empire that way. 
 Gentry, plebs, muddling and... bodging along together. 
 Arthur. Sir. 
 Arthur's been with me here nigh on... 
 20 years. 
 We couldn't live without each other. 
 Am I right, Arthur? 
 No doubt, Sir Francis. 
 What is it? 
 A telephone call for the prime minister, sir. 
 Oh. 
 Excuse me, gentlemen. 
 Yes? 
 Yes, I'm... with him now, as it happens. 
 No. 
 No. Come here. 
 Sit down, man. 
 Sit down. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I've told Lord Smytth what's afoot, and I've assured him you'll do your very best to resolve the situation quietly. 
 He quite rightly wants to know why the situation isn't resolved already. 
 Yes, sir. Uh, the vengeful young man pursuing your son is a highly skilled SAS combat veteran. 
 Hard to catch, hard to kill. 
 We can get him, sir, no doubt, but, um... it'll take some doing. 
 At a high cost in men and blood, perhaps. 
 Oh, indeed, Prime Minister. 
 A high cost. And then, I imagine, a good few indiscreet mouths will need to be silenced, I expect. 
 Yes, sir. That's usually the case. 
 You needn't lay it on so thick. 
 I know I'll have to pay for this. 
 Get the thing done. 
 Yes, my lord. 
 I make no excuses for him. 
 He's not right in the head. He never was. 
 But no child of mine is going to be hunted like an animal by a mere pleb. 
 Whatever he may have been accused of, he has noble blood in him. 
 And blood... is blood. 
 Oh, any father would do the same. 
 His mother... was the great love of my life. 
 As for payment, perish the thought. 
 What are friends for? Humbug. 
 What do you want? 
 Goes without saying your splendidly loyal support for me in the House has been most welcome. Essential, you mean. 
 Mm, quite so. 
 I should hate to lose that support, for any reason, under any circumstances. 
 Protect my son, get rid of this SAS ruffian, and I promise you my vote. 
 Under any circumstances. 
 Your son is safe. 
 _ 
 One, two, three. Testing. 
 Martha, do you know what time it is? 
 I do. 
 I figured you for an early riser. 
 What is this about? 
 Just passing. 
 Are you okay? 
 Fine. 
 Touch of the flu. 
 You shouldn't stay long. It's catching. 
 I never catch stuff. 
 What's the coffee situation? 
 I'll call room service. 
 So, the big Raven Society rally today, huh? 
 What are you guys doing about it? 
 Nothing. 
 Undine Thwaite told everyone to stay at home. 
 No. Not those guys. 
 You guys. CIA. 
 Now, I'm guessing you're gonna play a waiting game, but... 
 I think that would be a mistake. 
 The situation could deteriorate fast. 
 Look at me, Martha. 
 I'm not CIA. 
 I'm looking at you, Thomas, and I don't believe you. 
 Well, I can't help with that. 
 Anyhow, I'm here to tell you that I'm okay with the CIA thing. 
 I didn't want you to think it'd be a problem for me. 
 So we can continue working together. 
 That's a whole other issue. 
 Well, go on. 
 Let's face it, Martha. 
 I'm not CIA. 
 But supposing I was... you're not really... Agency material. 
 The hell I'm not. 
 Last week, whilst on a three-day blackout drug spree, you mislaid my sister at a satanist orgy. 
 Just a tad bit unprofessional, don't you think? 
 You son of a bitch. Unprofessional? 
 Look at you. 
 I have the flu. 
 You're drowning in scotch and pills, you haven't slept right in ages, you've been crying, and you're the big-shot CIA man? 
 Yeah, well, if you're the benchmark, I think I can measure up okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That was uncalled for. 
 That's all right. 
 Not in great shape at the present. 
 It's true. 
 What happened to you at Crowley's? 
 Not up for discussion. 
 You saw the Devil. 
 No. 
 No Devil. I did. I saw him. 
 No, Martha, you imagined him. 
 I wish. 
 Crowley is a spooky guy. 
 We both got spooked. 
 Let's leave it at that, shall we? 
 This coffee sucks. 
 You want some scotch? 
 Um... 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Hello? 
 He's been gift-wrapped for you. 
 Wapping Pumping Station. 
 Come alone. 
 You're up early. 
 Work, Mum. 
 You're up early, too. Yeah. 
 Making breakfast for your dad. 
 He's up early, too. 
 Yeah, work. 
 Sir Francis has a function. 
 My busy boys. 
 Where are you going? 
 West End. Meeting a client. 
 Got time for a bacon sandwich? 
 Or boiled egg and soldiers? 
 No, Mum. 
 Well, at least let me give you a hug, then. 
 Got to go. Don't want to be late. 
 Well, you be careful. 
 I love you, son.

 Who's there? 
 Who is it? 
 Pennyworth, is that you? 
 Good morning. 
 Good morning. 
 We meet at last, as they say. 
 Cat got your tongue? 
 I thought, when I finally met you, I'd have lots to say to you. 
 Questions to ask. 
 But now we're here, I've got nothing. 
 You're nothing. 
 You fool. 
 You think you've won. 
 Don't you? 
 You really think a dirty, stupid little pleb like you could outwit a man of noble blood? 
 Nah. 
 I know there's no winning this game. 
 But you got to play to the whistle, haven't you? 
 Isn't that right, Inspector Aziz?! 
 You can show yourself. 
 I've got no backup. You're safe. 
 Come have a chat to me. 
 I'm not a f*cking idiot. 
 I know a trap when I see one. 
 Why did you walk into it, then? 
 I don't know. 
 I think I don't give a f*ck anymore. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Makes my job easier, at any rate. 
 I don't know about easy. 
 You've got three men with you and another couple up there in cover with sniper rifles. 
 There and there. 
 I bet I can kill Curzon and one or two of your men before you can kill me. 
 I doubt that. 
 Let's find out, shall we? 
 Count to three. 
 Shoot him now. 
 Shoot him. One moment, sir, please. 
 I am genuinely sorry for all this chicanery. 
 His father has political clout. 
 You know the rest. 
 We have no choice. 
 Who's "we"? You and your conscience? 
 My superiors have no choice. 
 Therefore, I have no choice. 
 I understand. No hard feelings. 
 Count to three. 
 I told you to shoot him, damn it. 
 A direct bloody order. Do you hear? 
 Shut up! 
 
 
 
 Listen, if you give me your word of honor that you'll spare this man, I can let you escape, get out of the country. 
 What? That's not the f*cking plan. 
 Shoot him, man. Shoot him! Quiet! 
 That's very decent of you. 
 Won't do, though. He has to die. 
 Look at him! 
 Sad little madman. 
 Is he really worth your life? 
 You wretched little insect. 
 How dare you? How dare you?! 
 My father will have you hung! Is he worth your life? 
 No. 
 He's not worth anything. 
 Not fair, is it? Count to three. 
 Alfred, please. I don't need to count to three. 
 I just need to raise my finger. 
 Well, go ahead. Raise your finger, then. 
 Don't... you... dare. 
 Drop your weapons. 
 All of ya! 
 Tell 'em. 
 Do as she says. 
 Glad to see me now, aren't you, pet? 
 Say I'm wrong. 
 _ 
 Stop looking. 
 You said you had no backup. 
 And I actually believed you. 
 Well played. 
 Swear to God, Mr. Aziz, I didn't know she was here. 
 Look at me. 
 Who is she? 
 Looks very familiar. Long story. 
 You think we talk 'cause you can wait. 
 Oi. 
 I told you to wait. 
 I only gave him a few little jabs. 
 Keep her away from me. 
 Big baby. 
 Who's this, then? 
 Who are you? I'm nobody. 
 Nobody? Nobody? 
 What are you doing here, then? Tell the truth. 
 Nanny! I'm his nanny! 
 Is that right, duck? 
 She's your nanny? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I see, I see. You're one of them. 
 Filthy bastards. 
 Posh people. 
 Perverts, the lot of 'em. 
 It's a wonder they reproduce. 
 Get her away from me. 
 She's mad! 
 Mad? 
 I'm calm as a millpond, me! 
 You ain't seen nothing yet. 
 Sorry, there'll be no torture. 
 Give over. 
 We're not animals. 
 Speak for yourself. I need to see him suffer. 
 No. 
 You're a soldier. 
 Are you telling me you've never had a go? 
 I've done torture. 
 For answers. 
 To make people talk. 
 This one's got nothing to tell us. 
 He's mental. 
 He just needs to be dead. 
 Oh, God. This isn't right. 
 You owe me. 
 You know you do. 
 Give us ten minutes. 
 You don't need to watch. 
 Leave the room if you're squeamish. 
 No, I'm-I'm sorry. 
 I'm-I'm sorry. 
 I'm sick. I know I am. 
 I don't deserve this! 
 Do you not? 
 How many other women have you killed? 
 Esme wasn't your first, was she? 
 I can smell darkness on you. 
 I-I have a sickness. 
 I-I swear, if you let me go, I'll get treatment. 
 My-my family will... 
 Sorry, love. 
 What the f*ck? 
 I have to say, I'm very disappointed in you. 
 Welcome to the club. 
 I'm afraid this is gonna create a lot of trouble. 
 For all of us. 
 Be seeing you, then. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great honor to introduce to you our speaker of the day, talking to you on the subject of "A New Dawn," pro tem leader of the Raven Society, Dr. Frances Gaunt! 
 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
 Citizens of England, I will talk to you today about the future of our country. 
 This is a topic around which has settled a unanimous gloom. 
 All seem to agree that, if we're not destroyed by atom bombs, we will be ruined by poverty and moral decay, by unemployment and mob rule and angry dissent. 
 We are united only in our pessimism! 
 Today, I will talk to you of hope. 
 Hope and optimism and a glorious future. 
 Some of you will laugh, as if I'm talking about fairies and unicorns. 
 But no. Hope is real and powerful. 
 Once we have hope, then courage and strength and discipline will follow. 
 No trial cannot be endured. 
 No battle cannot be won. 
 Platitudes, you say. 
 Empty rhetoric. No. 
 I am not here to speak of hope. 
 I am here to show you. 
 I'm no leader, no visionary. 
 I'm a simple country doctor here only because a great man was brought low. 
 My predecessor in this post was Lord James Harwood. 
 He was a man of heroic vision and boundless energy. 
 A true patriot and a man of destiny. 
 So the powers that be were afraid of him and ordered his destruction. 
 They threw him into the Tower. 
 They kept him in a metal box, four foot square, and tortured him to the brink of death. 
 They mutilated him horribly. 
 And when he was thoroughly broken, they threw him naked into the streets, condemned to a living death, a crazed and crippled beggar. 
 My friends, fellow citizens, I hereby formally announce my resignation as leader of the Raven Society, effective immediately. 
 Where the devil is she going with this? 
 But it is my great honor to introduce our new leader, our guiding light, Lord James Harwood. 
 What's happening? 
 What the f*ck? 
 Oh, my God. 
 There goes our truce. 
 Wow. 
 Guess you were right. 
 Situation has deteriorated fast. 
 Doesn't he look handsome, eh? 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
 Hello, England. 
 Harwood! 
 Bravo! 
 Read the Riot Act. Send in the heavy brigade. 
 Arrest him. 
 Arrest everyone. 
 You cannot imagine how good it is to see you all here today. 
 A beautiful sight. 
 The same cannot be said for me, I'm afraid. 
 I hope that you will forgive my looks and listen to my message. 
 A new dawn is coming, my friends. 
 A fresh start for all of us! 
 I'm going to talk with you about the serious... 
 ... the serious problem that is fa... 
 Our sovereign queen commands all persons being assembled here to disperse and depart peacefully... 
 ... on penalties contained... 
 ... in the Riotous Assembly Act. 
 Close the door! 
 Please, stay calm. 
 Move! 
 Let's go! 
 Stop! 
 Officers of the law, this is England. 
 You will respect our ancient rights and liberties and stop this violence immediately! 
 Stand down. 
 Further violence was averted when the police allowed the crowd to disperse peacefully to their homes without arrest. 
 As we continue the news... 
 Double whiskey and two aspirin, please, Sid. 
 Got it. 
 You'll never guess who was on the telly. 
 I'll never guess. 
 You look... pale, Alfie. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, just a bit of a headache, that's all. 
 We looked for that Mrs. Pike all over. 
 Not hide nor hair. 
 Yeah. 
 Forget about all that. Sorted. 
 Sorted? Curzon? 
 You missed a prime show on the telly, Alfie. 
 High drama. 
 Did I? 
 See you later. 
 We'll not tell him anything. 
 But... 
 No. No, no, he'll make a fuss. 
 You all right, Dad? Ah. 
 Yeah, it's nothing. 
 Bumped into a door. 
 Clumsy so-and-so, he is. 
 Where have you been? 
 You don't look very well. 
 Give us a hug, Mum. 
 Oh, course. 
 What about me, then? 
 You're in a good mood. 
 Why not? 
 Today was a good day. 
 If you say so. 
 And tomorrow... tomorrow will be even better. 
 I hope you're right. 
 I know I am, son. 
 I know I am. 
 We've had a rough go of it, you know, all in all. 
 But things are gonna change now. 
 Well, Prime Minister, that didn't go very well, did it? 
 No, ma'am. It did not. 
 I could swear you told me Harwood was dead months and months ago. 
 "As good as dead," ma'am. 
 "As good as," I said. 
 Says here Harwood's a national sensation, a hero, darling of the disaffected masses. 
 Says he defied the police by 
 "sheer force of his commanding authority." 
 Well, perhaps with water cannon and rubber bullets, something might have been done. 
 Oh, it's my fault, is it? Certainly not, madam. 
 I-I merely point out the mitigating circumstances. 
 In any case, thrash the bugger in Trafalgar Square. 
 Make an example. Well, I would that were possible. 
 He's far too high-profile. 
 Detain him now, we'll have a tiger by the tail. 
 The press will scream blue murder. 
 There'll be angry mobs in the street howling for his liberty. 
 Well, what are we going to do, then? 
 I don't know, Your Majesty. 
 You'd better think of something bloody fast. 
 _ 
 I got it! Got it? 
 Yes. Ha. Oh, again? Hey! Bravo. 
 Oh, I've got it! I've got it! 
 Oh, what did I... what did I tell you, Frances? 
 I never doubted you. Oh, didn't you? 
 Good girl. I-I've got to confess I doubted myself. 
 I'm just jolly lucky that I'm not hanging in a dungeon. 
 Hear, hear. 
 Sir, your guests have arrived. 
 Oh, uh, jolly good. 
 They're a touch early. Will you stall them a moment? 
 Yes, Your Lordship. 
 Guests? 
 Yes. 
 You see, the question is, Frances, what now? 
 Yes, indeed. See, I see power within our grasp. 
 And when that day comes, some cold, hard decisions will have to be made. 
 Some people will be with us, and some against. 
 I'm confident about the army and the clergy, but Her Majesty the Queen... she troubles me. 
 The queen? 
 Well, I-I thought we were agreed she must be assured of our loyalty. 
 And we must be assured of her obedience. 
 Now, I know you're not keen on going down this road, but I see no alternative. 
 Down which road? 
 You do trust me, don't you, Frances? 
 Yes, yes, of course I do. 
 Well, if the queen should prove to be reluctant, then we will need to find an alternative. 
 We will need to find a replacement. 
 Their graces, the Duke and Duchess of Windermere. 
 Ah. 
 Welcome, sir, ma'am. 
 Welcome back to your lands. 
 Hello, Ez. 
 Sorry I haven't visited for a while. 
 If you're there, I expect you'll know that I killed the people who... 
 Well, you know. 
 Had to be done, and now I've done it. 
 You remember that first time we went out? 
 We were in the park, listening to a brass band, and I made you laugh. 
 And you looked at me in my eyes, and you smiled at me. 
 One of your proper happy smiles. 
 First one you ever gave me. 
 I thought, f*ck a duck, she likes me. 
 Best moment of my life, that was. 
 Best moment. 
 Used to be that that memory made me sad. 
 I woke up this morning, and I remembered it, and it didn't make me sad. 
 I saw you smile at me. 
 I sort of smiled back. 
 So that's good, isn't it? 
 Things are looking up.
