 This woman is my sister. 
 You followed me all the way to goddamn Europe? 
 I am here on business, Patricia. 
 But you don't know who I am? Jason Jason Ripper. 
 Would you f*ck your mum to save her life? 
 MARTHA: He didn't want to leave Esme alone. 
 [SOBBING] 
 But I persuaded him. 
 This is on me. 
 This is my fault. 
 RIPPER: Esme was killed to make you suffer. 
 Her killer is watching you squirm. 
 You know who killed her? 
 You'll give me the name if I do something for you first. 
 SYKES: I used to work for you. 
 You're Lord Harwood. 
 Lord James Harwood. 
 I'm not Harwood! Oh! All right. 
 _ JULIAN: The struggle continues, but it's not going well. 
 We're losing the battle on the streets. 
 We want a truce, and I asked them to arrange a meeting between myself and Frances Gaunt to discuss terms. 
 Then we'll kill her. 
 I got the distinct sense they know. 
 They know I'm CIA. 
 I have a job for you, if you're interested. 
 You have to succeed tonight if you want that name.

 NEWS READER: Civil disturbances and street violence between left and right-wing extremist groups have erupted across the nation following the unexplained death of Julian Thwaite, leader of the so-called No-Name League. 
 The prime minister has issued a statement. 
 We are facing the grave danger of outright anarchy... [HARWOOD GROANS] 
 T-Turn it off. Turn it off! 
 Turn it off, Lulu. 
 Yes, mistress. 
 Law and order are the walls... 
 Are you all right, Ginger? ... upon which the root of democracy sits.

 That's the man that hurt me.

 You're remembering. 
 He's remembering. 
 Well done. Keep thinking. 
 Do you remember your name? 
 J-James. 
 Bingo! 
 That's right, love. You're James. 
 James what? 
 James... 
 H-H-Harwood.

 [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] 
 Bloody idiots. 
 You mark my words, this carries on, we'll be swimming in rivers of blood. 
 We'll be paddling f*cking canoes in it. 
 Assassinations, riots. 
 You'd think we was French. 
 [COUGHING] 
 You all right, Daveboy? Been in the wars again? 
 [CLEARS THROAT] It's... It's just a scratch, pal. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] Oh. 
 Yes, sir, what can I get you? 
 I'm good, thank you. 
 I've been looking for you for two days. 
 I was poorly. 
 What happened? 
 Well... what can I say? 
 I cocked up, eh? 
 One of those things. Sorry. 
 I'm sorry, "one of those things"? 
 The wrong damn target was hit. 
 Fair play. 
 But that wasn't me. That was the other fella. 
 Ah, yes, the other fella. 
 The one who helped you escape. It was... 
 It was very kind of him. 
 Who was that? 
 Couldn't tell you. He was wearing a mask. 
 Ah, a mystery man, eh? 
 Who was he working for? 
 And how the hell would I know that? 
 Hmm. 
 I'll have to explain this mess to my bosses. 
 They'll need answers. 
 Any input? 
 No. 
 Here's my theory. 
 You were the assassin, but it wasn't Gaunt or the Raven Society who asked you to kill Thwaite. 
 Nor was it the government. They have plenty of killers. 
 Why come to you? 
 Then a name sprang to mind. 
 I hear you've become close friends with John Ripper. 
 You've been spying on me. 
 That's not a denial. I'll take it as a yes. 
 It was you who killed Thwaite, and Ripper who sent you. 
 Take it how you like. Leave me alone. 
 Now, why on Earth... would Ripper want to kill the leader of the No-Name League? 
 What's in it for him? 
 It's puzzling. 
 I suspect he's working for somebody else. 
 Don't suppose he told you, did he, who he's working for? 
 You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Wayne. 
 Are you sure you want the answers? 
 Well... that sounded vaguely like a threat. 
 I don't make threats. 
 Why tell people what you're going to do? 
 You may have started a civil war. 
 Haven't you done enough harm already? 
 I don't want you to get hurt. 
 I can't say the same for my friends. 
 Some of them aren't as gentle as I am. 
 You're not scaring me, Alfred. 
 I have friends like that, too. 
 Cheeky... f*ck. 
 What friends has he got? 
 He means the CIA. 
 Get to f*ck. 
 He's only posing as a No-Name League activist. 
 He's an American agent. CIA. 
 Evening, Daveboy. All right. 
 Alfie. 
 Same again? 
 Yeah. 
 And a bag of crisps. 
 b*st*rd. 
 What... What's got to her? 
 What's wrong with asking for crisps? 
 What? 
 Oh. 
 [DOOR SHUTS] 
 Want some? There's plenty. 
 No, thanks. 
 I did my part. 
 You promised me a name. 
 I did. 
 If there was an angel on your shoulder, she'd say, "Turn away now, Alfie. Walk away. 
 Serenity is the best revenge." 
 She'd be wrong. 
 So long as you're sure. 
 Go and see Baroness Ortsey, at Bethlehem Royal Hospital. 
 She'll tell you who killed Esme. 
 Who's Baroness Ortsey? 
 The baroness is... more of a "what" than a "who." 
 _ 
 I'm here to see Baroness Ortsey. 
 Fill out an application. 
 We'll process your request in due course and contact you by post. 
 I haven't got time for that. I need to see her now. 
 That won't be possible, sir. 
 John Ripper sent me. 
 ♪ 
 Good morning, ma'am. 
 ORTSEY: Good morning, Matron. 
 Good morning, young man. 
 What's your name? 
 Alfred Pennyworth. 
 Say it again. 
 Alfred Pennyworth. 
 I like your voice, Alfred Pennyworth. 
 How can I help you, Alfred? 
 Why are you in there? What did you do? 
 [CHUCKLES] Oh, horrors, my dear, horrors. 
 Don't ask again or I'll tell you. 
 You'll wish you didn't know. 
 Why are you here, Alfred? 
 John Ripper said you can tell me who killed my fiancée. 
 But now you're here, you have doubts. 
 Well, I was expecting, you know, an informer. 
 You're a fortune teller, aren't you? 
 Oh, dear me, no. 
 I'm a witch. Different. 
 I don't believe in witches and ghosts and all that malarkey. 
 The truth doesn't care what you believe. 
 All right, then, who killed my fiancée? 
 Tell me, and I'll cross your palm with silver. 
 Sarcasm is a very ugly form of wit. 
 And I don't know who killed your fiancée. 
 So you're wasting my time then. 
 Actually, you're wasting mine. 
 Sorry to bother you. 
 Who is the other woman? 
 What do you mean by that? ORTSEY: What I say. 
 I... get a very strong feeling there's another woman involved in the murder of your fiancée. 
 Who is she? 
 There is no other woman. 
 Then I'm mistaken. 
 Never mind. 
 You're very good... at standing still and silent. 
 That's a wonderful gift. 
 Go on. 
 Go on? 
 Do your hocus-pocus. 
 No, I won't. 
 Why not? 
 You're rude and cynical, and I don't want to help you. 
 I apologize. Not good enough. 
 Well, what do you want me to say? 
 Say, "Please, Madame, help me. 
 I'll do anything." 
 [SCOFFS SOFTLY] 
 Please, Madame, help me. I'll do anything. 
 Very well. I'll help you, but first, you must prove your faith in me. 
 How? 
 When the moon is full, bring me a red rose and the left hand of a murderer. 
 And I'll tell you all you need to know. 
 Give over. 
 How about some toad's eyeballs? 
 You're a nutcase, you are, or a bloody liar. 
 Either way, I'm a mug. 
 You'll be back, Alfred. 
 You'll be back. 
 [PURRING] 
 _ 
 Good to see you, Thomas. 
 Good to see you, sir. 
 The folks back home are eager to hear what went wrong with the Gaunt operation from your perspective. 
 Why it wasn't Gaunt assassinated? 
 Well, my man cocked it up. 
 One of those things. 
 I was... very upset at first, but then I analyzed the situation, and I find... 
 I can't blame myself. 
 Not entirely. 
 In fact, I rather blame the Company. 
 I should have been informed about all of your plans. 
 Should you indeed? Explain. 
 I asked myself, who ordered the death of Julian Thwaite? 
 Not Gaunt and the Raven Society. 
 Not Downing Street or the queen. 
 No? 
 The Thwaites were a team. 
 Why kill one of them when you should kill both? 
 Who benefits from such an odd arrangement? 
 Only one person... Undine Thwaite. 
 She becomes undisputed leader of the League. 
 Thin reasoning. 
 Oh, I have other evidence. 
 I'm just giving you the bones here. 
 If she did kill her husband, she's one of two things. 
 A reckless fool, or a woman with powerful friends backing her play. 
 From which I conclude Undine Thwaite and the U.S. government conspired together to kill Julian Thwaite. 
 Interesting idea. 
 That's not a denial. 
 I can tell you... that we have an asset very close to Undine Thwaite. 
 We control her. 
 Your asset's John Ripper. 
 I can't confirm or deny that. 
 Now you get to clean up the mess. 
 The U.S. congressional elections are coming up. 
 America needs at least six months of peace and quiet in Europe. 
 So we need a truce between the Ravens and the No-Names. 
 That's an executive operational memo. 
 In the next few days, Undine Thwaite will arrange another meeting with Gaunt. 
 Our asset will make sure you'll be there as one of Thwaite's team. 
 This time, she'll offer Gaunt a sincere and reasonable truce. 
 If Gaunt accepts, well and good. 
 If she refuses, she has to go. 
 Last time we spoke, Gaunt was dead at any price. 
 She's scared now. 
 Nearly dying will do that. 
 She'll be more flexible. 
 If Gaunt plays ball, she lives. 
 If not, you take her out. 
 Me? 
 Personally? 
 Are you ready? 
 Yes. 
 I am. 
 You tricked me! 
 How's that? 
 The old lady's a nutter. 
 Thinks she's a bloody witch. 
 And you don't believe her? 
 'Course I bloody don't. 
 There's no such thing as witches. 
 Sincerely, Alfie. 
 I know the baroness can help you if you give her a chance. 
 If you have a little faith. 
 You tricked me, Mr. Ripper. 
 Suppose I did. 
 What then? 
 Well, then, I'm very disappointed in you. 
 That's life. 
 I'm an undertaker. 
 Nobody I meet is happy. 
 _ 
 It's so good to see you out and about again, Alfie. 
 Isn't it, Mr. P? Yes, it is. 
 Only... you seem so angry. 
 Are you angry? 
 Me? Angry? No. 
 I'm your mother, Alfie. 
 I know your moods. 
 You've every... every right to be upset after what you've been through, son. 
 So long as you don't... go back to lolling in bed. 
 What are you trying to say? 
 We're worried, Alfie. 
 All this running about with John Ripper. 
 I don't like to speak ill of anyone, but he is not a good man. 
 I'm sorry, but he's not. He's... 
 Well, I wouldn't like to say what he is. 
 He's a bad influence. 
 Oh, don't worry, Mum. 
 I know what he is, and he's got no influence over me. 
 I'm done with him, and all that dark sh1t. 
 Got to look on the bright side. 
 Well, I'm very glad to hear it. 
 You've no need of friends like that, son. 
 You've got family that loves you. 
 MARY: That's right. 
 You remember that. 
 I will. 
 I'm sorry I've been such a burden since... 
 ... since Esme died.

 Why don't you buy a place? This is not convenient. 
 I have an urgent business meeting right now. Don't worry.

 500 pounds should be enough. 
 I can't give you any money, Patricia. 
 You'll spend it on drugs. 
 And I can't look after you right now. 
 Who asked you to look after me? 
 I distinctly told you to leave me the f*ck alone, did I not?

 There you are, Alfie. 
 I was worried about you. 
 I was in the jungle, Mum. 
 It was horrible. 
 What did you do to me? 
 Nothing. 
 You can go now. 
 That's all? That's all. 
 Sounds like a damn poor witch. 
 There must be more. 
 Same again, lads? 
 Just a glass of water for me, please. 
 For f*ck sake, Spanish, go away. 
 Shh.

 Alfred? 
 Yeah. What? 
 You fell asleep for a moment. 
 I was dreaming. 
 The tea. There was something in the tea. 
 Of course there was something in the tea. 
 I'm a witch. 
 My God. 
 It was him. 
 The captain. 
 He killed Esme. Is that it? 
 I don't know. Is it? 
 The captain. 
 I hope I've been of some help. 
 You have to go now.

 Alfie, thank goodness. Where have you been? 
 I was out with the boys. 
 All night? 
 [SIGHS]: Oh, as long as you're home safe. 
 Ooh, you're as cold as ice. 
 And you've cut yourself. 
 How'd you do that? 
 I don't know. 
 It's nothing. 
 Oh.

 [BIRDS SQUAWKING] 
 Those posh bastards in London will swallow their teeth when they see you, won't they, Mrs. Spicer? 
 They'll be extremely surprised. 
 I am looking rather spiffy, aren't I? 
 I'm that proud of you. 
 I wish you'd wait a bit, though, before going south. 
 Get all your strength back. 
 I am fit as a fiddle, my dear. 
 Ooh, ooh! [GROANS] 
 Wreaking revenge and redeeming your rights and saving the country is all well and good to talk about, but doing it, well, it's a different thing. 
 You'll overtax yourself. 
 No. I've never felt more alive. 
 More full of passionate energy. 
 The winds of destiny are broad abeam. 
 Thank you, Bet. 
 Give over. No. 
 If it wasn't for your friendship and generosity, then I... [DOOR OPENS] 
 PEGGY: Hello? 
 I was... I was just saying, Peggy, I owe my life and my soul to your-your deep kindness. 
 I shall never forget. 
 Go on. BET: He says he's off back to London soon as he's made arrangements. 
 Oh. 
 Are you sure you're ready? 
 See? 
 I've been very happy here, but my duty says that I must go. 
 There's no time to waste. 
 PEGGY: Then you must go. 
 Won't say we won't miss you. 
 Will you come with me to London? 
 Both of you? 
 Really? 
 Well, I have a battle ahead. 
 I'll need loyal friends. 
 Friends that I love and trust. 
 PEGGY: London. 
 I don't know. 
 We'll go. 
 Splendid. 
 And then everybody laughed at him. 
 Do you remember? 
 I do. Aye. 
 The captain. 
 Tall, skinny fella. Posh. 
 Yeah, that's right. Him. 
 I say! 
 Steady on, Doris. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 What about him? 
 When we buried Spanish, he was there, watching. 
 You were whistling "Lili Marlene." 
 I caught his eye. He looked away. 
 But for a split second, I saw his face. 
 [DAVEBOY WHISTLING "LILI MARLENE"] 
 Pure murder. 
 I forgot all about him. 
 Never thought of him all these years. 
 Alfred... I think it was him. 
 The captain, he killed Esme to punish me. 
 Lots of captains wanted to punish you. 
 No, I think it was him. 
 The witch told you this? 
 Well, not exactly. No. 
 I saw him... in a dream. 
 Well, more of a vision, really. 
 He was crystal clear, though. 
 He has been waiting. 
 Waiting all this time to pay me back. 
 For embarrassing him five years ago? 
 Now, look, if you could see how he looked at me, you'd understand. 
 I remembered his name. 
 ALFRED: Captain John Fitz-Smytth Curzon, Third Battalion, Rutland Fusiliers. 
 I called the Army Records Office. 
 He survived the war. 
 That's where he lives. 
 Alfie, just so we're clear, you've no proof yet... nothing. 
 A feeling. [COCKS GUN] 
 No bloodshed. 
 Please say yes. 
 Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 ALFRED: What the f*ck is this? 
 "Ha ha. 
 "A little too late, my friend. 
 "Don't think I'm sorry or scared. 
 I'm glad you know the truth."
