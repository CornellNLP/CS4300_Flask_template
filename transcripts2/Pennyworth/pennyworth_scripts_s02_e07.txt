 Hello, Alfie. 
 All right, boys.

 Melanie. 
 f*ck’s sake. 
 You’re lucky I didn’t kill you. 
 Mm. Well, that’s me. 
 Lucky. 
 What are you doing here? 
 [drawer closes] 
 Should I not have come? 
 You’re taking a big risk. 
 The risk’s half the fun, no? 
 No. 
 [chuckles] 
 Gully doesn’t know anything. 
 Stands to reason. 
 Neither of us would be walking around. 
 Someone knows. 
 People know. 
 f*ck people. 
 Do you want to get found out? 
 Do you have a death wish? 
 Hmm. 
 We’re asking the deep questions now. 
 Okay. [inhales] 
 [exhales] 
 Why are you ashamed of who you really are? 
 Who’s that then? 
 Oh, you play this hard-hearted tough guy, but, actually, you’re kind of a softie. 
 Mm, feminine almost. 
 Get out. 
 [chuckles] 
 You’re a do-gooder. 
 Mm. 
 You only like me because you think I need rescuing. 
 You got me all wrong, love. 
 Heart of stone, me. 
 Mm. 
 See? 
 [whispers]: Ashamed. 
 Did you come here for the banter or what? 
 Mm-mmm. 
 [chuckling] 
 [birds chirping] 
 [door opens] 
 Need. 
 I appeal to you, my people, at this time of great need. 
 Uh, I… urge you, my people, at this critical time. 
 I urge you, my people, at this critical time. 
 [Newsreader] …intercepted before they reach the capital. 
 No supper for the League tonight. 
 We sign off with greetings to our leader, Lord Harwood, who’s taking some time off at his country estate, recovering from a bout of the flu. 
 [quietly]: Bloody liars. 
 We wish him all the very best. 
 Get well soon, Your Lordship. 
 [turns off TV] 
 [birds chirping] 
 [exhales] 
 It’s beautiful, isn’t it? 
 [chuckles softly] 
 Sir… 
 It’s all right, old chap. 
 Just gonna sit under the old walnut tree. 
 This is your perimeter, sir. 
 Father planted it on my seventh birthday. 
 I’m sorry, sir. You can’t go any further. 
 Don’t be absurd. 
 It’s only ten feet away. 
 Do I look like I’m gonna run off? 
 Orders. 
 [grunts] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [Thursday] You, Colonel Salt? 
 In charge? 
 Colonel as was. 
 “Sir John Salt” being my current title. 
 [Thursday] In charge of the whole damn country? 
 Yeah, it seems strange to me, too, but there we are. 
 I shall do my best. 
 What about the Union Council? 
 [Salt] An advisory body, sir. 
 When the chancellor’s indisposed, the Union constitution stipulates that his deputy administers business until such time as the chancellor is fit for duty again. 
 Or, if he is unable to return, an election can be held. 
 Ridiculous. But very well. 
 You can start by putting Harwood on trial. 
 Trial? 
 Speedy trial for murder or commitment to a lunatic asylum. 
 The Army won’t settle for less. 
 Nor should they. 
 But a trial now? 
 It would be a terrible blow to the war effort. 
 And the war’s near won. 
 Only London remains. 
 A war won mostly by the Army so far. 
 We will win, with or without your Raven Union militias. 
 With or without Harwood. 
 I’m sure you’re right, General. 
 So why talk of disunity at this bright moment? 
 If we simply bide our time and keep Harwood locked up safe and quiet on his estate until victory is ours, would that be such a crime? 
 Mm. 
 We need him alive and well for now, smiling for the newsreels. 
 Nobody need know he’s your prisoner. 
 [Thursday] Perhaps you’re right. 
 And if, as an absolute last resort, we were forced to use Stormcloud… 
 …it would be done in Harwood’s name. 
 God forbid. 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, yes, indeed. 
 God forbid. 
 Now, in the meantime, I think it’s best we formulate a plan 
 in Harwood’s absence. 
 Yes, yes. 
 [Salt] I understand the southern territories are… 
 [line ringing] 
 [Peggy] Sykes’ Pain Supplies. 
 [quietly]: Is that Bet? 
 Bet Sykes? 
 No, it’s Peg, her sister. 
 Who’s this? 
 I work for Raven HQ. 
 I transfer Lord Harwood’s calls. 
 Oh, yes, love. 
 Is anything wrong? 
 Yes, actually. 
 There is something wrong. 
 ♪ 
 ♪ 
 [Dallas] The president and her people have discussed your report in depth. 
 They’ve decided we’re gonna let this one ride. 
 You’re doing nothing? 
 No action? 
 Plenty action. 
 All but essential U.S. government personnel are to be evacuated from London. 
 By stages, as discreetly as possible, of course. 
 And then what? 
 Well, this is an internal dispute in a sovereign nation. 
 None of our business. 
 A brand-new weapon of mass destruction is likely gonna be used on civilians. 
 That’s not America’s business? 
 No. 
 Can we at least brief Prime Minister Aziz on the situation? 
 The League have no idea what they’re facing. 
 The people of London… 
 No, absolutely not. 
 The League leadership and the London public will find out about Stormcloud soon enough. 
 It’s not our job to inform them. 
 The U.S. government doesn’t officially know about Stormcloud, and we don’t need to know. 
 We need deniability. 
 [Lucius] But you do know. 
 I’ll deny that. 
 You… 
 Ma’am, surely now is the time for the U.S. government to intervene forcefully, to forbid the use of Stormcloud under international laws. 
 If Stormcloud is used, it’ll end the war pretty damn quick, right? 
 Uh, well… 
 Well, yes, I guess it would. 
 Well, your president thinks ending wars quickly is good. 
 My God. 
 You sons of bitches want them to use Stormcloud? 
 Dr. Fox, you’ve been through a harrowing experience. 
 Emotional feelings are only to be expected. 
 You’ll both be on the embassy flight tomorrow, without fail. 
 Now, until then, you speak to no one. 
 Silence. 
 Clear? 
 Clear, Chief. 
 Very clear. 
 Wait a minute. You… 
 You cut me off! 
 I had so much more to say to her! 
 That is precisely why I cut you off. 
 I was doing you a favor. 
 Don’t do me any more favors. 
 Once those people mark you down as unreliable, you’re out. 
 I want out anyway. 
 And you are “those people.” 
 Two fair points. 
 And “those people” are fixing to drop-drop a literal terror bomb on the city we’re standing in. 
 And those people want us to run away without warning anyone. 
 Again, fair points. 
 I should’ve let you dig a deeper hole for yourself. 
 I apologize. 
 How the heck can you be so calm and complacent? 
 Are you seriously gonna go along with this sh1t? 
 I’m just as mad as you are. 
 We work for coldhearted sons of bitches, and now they’ve crossed a line. 
 There’s no use telling them that. 
 They know what they are. 
 You won’t change their minds– you’ll only irritate them. 
 Better than saying nothing at all. 
 [coin clinks] 
 I beg to differ. 
 Someday, when you need federal research money for some cockamamie invention, you’ll thank me. 
 [rotary dial clicking] 
 [phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Martha? 
 Oh. Hi. 
 I’m-I’m glad you rang. 
 We need to talk. 
 Yes, we do. 
 As soon as possible. 
 Uh… Yes. 
 Good. It’s important. 
 Yes, it is. 
 What is it you’re talking about? 
 Well… what do youwant to talk about? 
 Well, I don’t want to say over an open line. 
 Okay, well… same. 
 Let’s say this evening at your place? 
 Um… 
 [fridge door opens] 
 I’ll be here. 
 Good. 
 Huh. 
 What? 
 [Patricia] Huh. 
 What? 
 [Lucius] Just… 
 huh. 
 He was acting kind of weird. 
 So were you. 
 No, thanks. 
 Oh, right. 
 Taxi! 
 I apologize. 
 For what? 
 For calling you one of those people. 
 I am one of those people. 
 I need a drink. Do you drink, Lucius? 
 I will drink you under the porch. 
 Two quid? You’re robbing me, Mr. Applebaum. 
 Robbing you? I’m killing myself. 
 That’s solid oak, that is. 
 [Applebaum] Oak shmoke. 
 By next week, matchwood, maybe. 
 You’ve been saying that for years. 
 And now I’m right. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 That’s a fiver, at least. 
 Alfie boy, talk sense to your mum. 
 They’ve got us surrounded. 
 [door opens] 
 London might be burning next week. 
 That right? 
 Gonna kill all of us, those that aren’t making their lucky escape. 
 [door closes] 
 And she wants five pounds for that? 
 Good morning, Alfie. 
 All right, Gully. 
 I’ll be in the kitchen if you need me, Alfie. 
 Come back later, Mr. A. 
 All right, mate. 
 [door opens] 
 I’d like to apologize for the way it all ended up on the last job. 
 Things got a little bit, uh, minty. 
 I’ve ironed the problem out now though. 
 Mm. 
 So… you really are leaving then. 
 Told you I was. 
 Hmm. I’ve got one last job for you. 
 Real beauty. 
 I’m in the air tomorrow. 
 What’s the hurry, Alfie? 
 Huh? Airplanes leave every week. 
 You’ll find someone else. 
 I don’t want anybody else. 
 I want you, Alfie. 
 Let me tell you about the job, at least. 
 Your share would be ten grand, minimum. 
 [scoffs] 
 You could have a tunnel under Threadneedle Street. 
 Makes no difference. 
 I’m leaving tomorrow. 
 You were just gonna, uh… disappear, were you? 
 Without so much as a word of farewell. 
 There’s been no time. 
 Well, I’m glad we had this chance to say goodbye at least. 
 Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 Is there something you’re not telling me, Alfie? 
 No. 
 Oh, well, there must be something. 
 Must be. 
 No. 
 There is, isn’t there? 
 No. 
 I beg, beg, mind you, a dear old comrade for help and he refuses me because he has a flight to catch? 
 Seems improbable to me. 
 f*ck’s sake, Gully. 
 I’m going to America. 
 The flight’s booked. 
 I got tickets with seat numbers and everything. 
 Mm. 
 Right. Cheerio. 
 Cheerio. 
 You’re breaking my heart, Alfie. 
 You’re breaking my f*cking heart. 
 [door opens] 
 [door closes] 
 [birds chirping] 
 Ooh, look, love, new boys. 
 Passes, please. 
 Passes? 
 We live here. 
 You’ve still to show your passes. 
 Cheeky monkey. Ignore ’em, Bet. 
 Passes, indeed. 
 Wait a sec. 
 Touch me and I’ll scream bloody murder. 
 She will, you know. Klaxon with tits, this one. 
 I’m warning you. Not a finger. 
 What’s all this then? 
 They’d not show their passes. 
 Is that so? 
 [grunting] 
 [Policewoman] Oi! 
 [grunting] 
 [clattering] 
 [panting] 
 Hmm. 
 [door opens] 
 Just leave it on the side, ladies. 
 [Peggy] Oh, my God. 
 Look at the state of you. 
 [Harwood] Girls! 
 How on earth did you get in? 
 Well, never mind that. 
 We’ve come to get you out. 
 We’ve got a car and a driver down the road. 
 Well, that’s very heroic of you, but how do you propose to do that? 
 That’s the British Army outside. 
 A dozen pimpled squaddies. No trouble. 
 Well, go and get your toiletries, some clean underpants and we’ll be away. 
 I suppose you heard what I did. 
 [vehicle approaching] 
 I lost my temper, killed a poor boy. 
 Beat him to death. 
 Yeah, we heard. 
 Could happen to anyone. 
 I should have stayed in Salford with you two. 
 I was happy there. 
 I told you as much at the time. 
 Now, by all means, feel sorry for yourself, but we’ve just duffed up several squaddies, so we need to be away sharpish. 
 No, I-I’m beaten. 
 The Army will never forgive me. Salt planned it all along. 
 He removed my family and my allies and then he led me by the nose to ruin, like the foolish old goat I am. 
 Salt? 
 That speccy plonker? 
 I know. 
 It’s hard to credit, isn’t it? 
 My people came over with the Conqueror. 
 We fought at Poitiers, Agincourt, Water-fucking-loo. 
 [chuckles] 
 And here I am, deposed and deceived by a jumped-up grocer. 
 He made himself indispensable to me, and now he’s done exactly the same to the Army and the Union. 
 And while he’s ruling in my name as my deputy, then no one dare touch him. 
 Not if you stop him. 
 The best way to stop him is to die now. 
 With me dead, he won’t be able to rule in my name. 
 He won’t last long without that leverage. 
 But then you’d be dead. 
 So let’s keep our thinking hats on, eh? 
 Too right. 
 No, good. You’re right. 
 I can’t exactly kill myself, can I? 
 Cardinal sin and all that. 
 Correct. 
 So let’s be away before someone raises the alarm. 
 [reverb] 
 [Man] Lord Harwood, the house is surrounded by a battalion of the 3rd Rutland Infantry. 
 You cannot escape. 
 I ask you to surrender yourself and your accomplices without further violence. 
 Sorry, ladies. 
 I seem to have led you into a sad predicament. 
 It’s not your fault. We came of our own accord. 
 Mind you, if you hadn’t dithered… 
 No point nagging him now, eh? 
 [shouting in distance] 
 How old are those sandwiches? 
 Oh, they’re jolly good. You should help yourself. 
 I wasn’t nagging him. 
 You were. 
 No, I was merely pointing out that if we’d left five minutes earlier, we’d be in a better position now. 
 [Sykes] That’s what nags do. 
 They merely point things out. 
 [door opens] 
 [Man] Clear. 
 I’ll secure the library. 
 [Harwood] You there. 
 You tell them for me. 
 I don’t want any more bloodshed, but I don’t trust you Army chaps. 
 I’ll surrender tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow and not before. 
 And only to Colonel Salt. 
 Only to him. 
 In person. 
 Colonel Salt! 
 Surrender? 
 Yes. 
 Well, I bought us some time. 
 We can have a-a splendid evening together. 
 Just like the old days. 
 Lovely. 
 Couldn’t be better. 
 She’s being sarky now ’cause I called her a nag, but she is, isn’t she? 
 [Peggy] No, I am not. 
 You are. 
 [Peggy] No, I’m not. 
 To me? Only to me? 
 They were very specific on that point, sir. 
 Typical. 
 Empty theatrics, Miss Dixon. Empty theatrics. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Damn the man! 
 I’ll have to go. 
 We can’t allow this to escalate. 
 Tell them I’ll be there in the morning. 
 Reiterate that he’s not to be harmed. 
 Not to be harmed under any circumstances. 
 [boisterous chatter, laughter] 
 [Man] Here we go, eh?! 
 Make way for Union VIPs. Let us through. 
 [laughing] 
 Glory to the Union! 
 Glory to Lord Harwood! 
 Hooray! Glory to the Union! 
 Glory to Lord Harwood! 
 Hey! 
 [laughter, chatter] 
 Glory to the Union! 
 Glory to Lord Harwood! 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 I didn’t warm to you, Thomas, not at first. 
 Now I begin to like you. 
 Gee whiz. 
 You present as a very conventional, anally-retentive company man. 
 But now I see you have a reckless, romantic side– a kind of high-functioning schizophrenia. 
 Huh. Well, uh, I didn’t much like you at first either. 
 The jury’s still out. 
 [cork pops] 
 [squealing] 
 Over there! Ha! No! 
 [laughing] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 [Sid] Still here then? 
 Off tomorrow. 
 Bon voyage, dosser. 
 [Alfred] Yeah. Fair play. 
 Gentlemen. 
 My liberator. 
 I never got a chance to express my gratitude. 
 Oh, don’t thank me. 
 It was all Mr. Wayne. Stopped at nothing to get you out. 
 Ah. Yes. Um… 
 I’m sorry I went to Aziz. 
 [glass tinkling, cheering] 
 How did he persuade you in the end? 
 Never you mind. 
 Come. 
 Join us. 
 Just the one. I’m on duty. 
 Alfred runs this place. 
 My last night, I’m happy to say. 
 Alfred and his mother are on our same flight tomorrow. 
 You’re leaving, too? 
 Shh.

 Oh? 
 Three winners in a row at Sandown Park this afternoon. 
 Oh. Brava. 
 Mm. 
 [chuckles] 
 You don’t look very happy. 
 Well, it’s horse racing, not Zen Buddhism. 
 Mm, you’re never very happy. Not recently. 
 It makes me wonder if everything’s quite, um, shipshape. 
 [chuckles] 
 Shipshape? 
 Mm. 
 Why wouldn’t it be? 
 Well, quite. 
 What could– what could possibly be wrong? 
 Everything is shipshape. 
 Good. 
 Just checking. Oh… 
 I’ll have a little splash. [chuckles softly] 
 [pouring] 
 You haven’t asked if everything’s all right with me. 
 Is everything all right with you? 
 Well, uh, since you ask, uh… 
 I-I’m feeling a little sad today. 
 Why is that? 
 I went to see… 
 Alfie. 
 Oh? 
 Yeah. 
 Tried to get him on the next job, but he said no. 
 Leaving for America, you know. 
 Oh. That’s a shame. 
 But I expect you can manage just fine without him, can’t you? [chuckles softly] 
 But, see, it’s not just, uh… not just that. 
 No, he-he seemed tense, nervous. 
 It was almost as if he was… scared of me. 
 [chuckles] 
 Well, I expect he was. 
 Mm. 
 Lots of people are scared of you. 
 I have a theory. 
 Mm? 
 Want to hear it? 
 I can’t stop you. 
 Yeah, I think… 
 Alfie was scared of me because he suspected that I know the truth. 
 What truth? 
 Oh, come on. 
 What truth? 
 You know. 
 I know what? 
 The truth. 
 The truth. The truth. Gully, stop talking in riddles. 
 Riddles? No. 
 A joke… 
 maybe. 
 [grunts] 
 [chuckles] 
 [whispers]: I-I know. 
 [chuckles] 
 Melanie.

 Oh, come on. Say it. 
 Just say it. Huh? 
 Say it. Tell me. Tell me.

 Tell me. Say it. 
 Say it! 
 You want me to say that I f*cked Alfie Pennyworth, huh? 
 Is that what you want? 
 [breathing heavily] 
 All right.

 I f*cked him. 
 Oh. 
 And I loved it. 
 Hmm.

 Next time, you can watch if you like.

 Obviously. 
 You’re getting your mother and yourself out of harm’s way. 
 Exactly. 
 Stay here and fight? 
 Why? What for? 
 Can’t hold back the tide. 
 Can’t be done. 
 Isaac Newton sorted all that. 
 Isaac Newton sorted what? 
 Tides. Caused by the gravity of the moon. 
 I know how bloody tides work. 
 I’m saying you can’t argue with gravity. 
 Oh, really? 
 Speak for yourself. 
 [chuckling] 
 [door closes] 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Melanie. 
 I was, um, thinking aloud. 
 [air-raid siren wailing in distance] 
 What happened? 
 Are you all right? 
 Been better. 
 [exhales] 
 Eh. 
 Come on. 
 He said you seemed scared. 
 Made him suspicious. 
 That’s it? That’s all he has? 
 Were you? 
 Scared. 
 No. 
 Well, maybe a bit. 
 I denied everything, but he just– he knew. 
 And he attacked me and strangled me. 
 I hit him with a vase. [chuckles softly] 
 [exhales] I think he’s hurt, but I don’t know. 
 There was a lot of blood. 
 I ran away. 
 You don’t know where he is now? 
 No. 
 Turns out you were wrong. 
 I don’t have a death wish. 
 I was actually… very frightened. 
 Well, there’s a silver lining then. 
 No death wish. 
 And you’re safe here. 
 As angry as he was, I could see in his heart that he was glad. 
 Now he can be his true self. [shudders softly] 
 He’ll kill me. I’m not safe anywhere. 
 I’ll handle Gully. 
 No. 
 No, you have a plane to catch. 
 And you’d better be on it. 
 Or he’ll kill you, too. 
 You’d better come to America with me then. 
 [chuckles] 
 Sure. 
 Have you got a passport? 
 Yes, but… 
 You’re sorted then. 
 I’ve still got plenty of cash, and that’s all it takes to get you there. 
 No, it’s a lot of money. 
 Easy come, easy go. 
 You… you would really do that? 
 For me? 
 I’m buying you a plane ticket. I’m not offering marriage. 
 [chuckles] 
 Yeah, well, I’d have to say no if you did. 
 Would you? 
 Mm. 
 You’re not my type. 
 Mm. Too soft. 
 [chuckles] 
 You-You’re not… you’re not joking? 
 America? 
 What did I just say? 
 [scoffs] 
 [chuckling, stammering] Well, I’m going to America. 
 [chuckling] 
 [groans] 
 Sorry. [chuckles]

 No, kiss me.

 Good day, Miss Kane. 
 Sorry it’s late. 
 Late? 
 Do you have any idea what time it is? 
 Yes. I have an excellent internal clock. 
 It is 1:35. 
 Rhetorical question. 
 [Lucius] Oh. I hate those. 
 Martha. 
 You have to get out of here right now. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Stormcloud. 
 What about Stormcloud? What is it? 
 Chemical weapon. 
 Very, very bad. 
 They are going to use it on London. 
 And the U.S. government is going to look the other way. 
 They want the war over. They’re not gonna tell the League what they know. 
 But you just told me. 
 So you know I’m going straight to Aziz with this. 
 Well, I hope so. 
 The best way to stop Stormcloud is public exposure. 
 If Aziz yells loud enough, 
 the White House can’t feign ignorance. 
 The president can’t openly support a war crime. 
 She’ll have to intervene. 
 I’ll go to Aziz first thing. 
 Well, uh, 
 don’t tell him who told you. 
 I think he’ll know anyhow. 
 Well, if anyone asks, I’ll deny telling you anything. 
 Unless, of course, I’m under oath. But I… I doubt it will come to that. 
 Hmm. 
 What? 
 [chuckles] 
 I’m… I’m just surprised. 
 And glad. You’re doing the right thing. 
 Well, I’m glad you’re glad, but I’m surprised you’re surprised. 
 Why would I not try to stop a mass murder? 
 I don’t know. To… avoid seeming unconventional? 
 She’s got your number. 
 You know your bosses will work out who talked. 
 Deniability’s all I need. 
 [Patricia] Okay. 
 Okay, you’re denied. 
 Martha, where’s the aspirin? 
 Hi. 
 I’m Patricia. 
 Who are you? 
 Lucius. 
 Oh. 
 Say that again. 
 Lucius? 
 [chuckles] 
 You have got such a lovely timbre to your voice. 
 [clears throat] 
 Why is everyone so glum? 
 And what are you doing here? 
 My sister. 
 Pat, focus. 
 There may soon be a chemical attack on London. 
 We’re booked on a U.S. government flight leaving today. 
 We’re all getting on that flight. Pat, no arguments. 
 Oh. I’ll be on it. Absolutely. 
 I despise chemicals. Don’t you, Lucius? 
 Just to be clear, I’m not going anywhere. 
 Of course not. That figures. 
 You’re not going? 
 We can stop them. We can stop Stormcloud. 
 Oh, please. 
 We have to. 
 Martha, you have to go. What about… 
 No! Come on, Patricia. Let’s make some coffee. 
 [clinking] 
 See what I have to deal with? 
 [pouring] 
 Uh-huh. 
 [clinking] 
 [pigeons cooing] 
 [sniffs] 
 [brakes squeak, horn honks in distance] 
 Right. That’ll be him. 
 About bloody time. 
 [grunts] 
 [exhales] 
 [bell tolling in distance] 
 [door opens] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [mutters] 
 There you are. 
 We’ve been worried sick. 
 Now, Mum, this is Melanie. 
 Melanie, my mum. 
 Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Pennyworth. 
 Long story. She’s coming with us. 
 Mm. 
 [door closes] 
 [man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 Be back in a minute. 
 [indistinct announcement over P.A.] 
 Mrs. P. 
 Sit there. 
 Hi. 
 And, um, 
 that covers everything, right? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Just a few questions for English border control. 
 Reason for departure? 
 Reason? 
 Why are you leaving England? 
 Lots of reasons. 
 Business or pleasure? 
 Is it business or pleasure? 
 Oh. Uh, business. 
 [Melanie] Have you flown before, Mrs. Pennyworth? 
 No. 
 It’s a little scary at first, but then it’s-it’s quite fun. 
 I expect you’re a very experienced traveler. 
 I am. 
 Like to keep moving, do you? 
 [woman over P.A.] Flight is now ready to board. 
 [indistinct announcements continue] 
 [Daveboy chuckles nervously] Here’s-here’s Alfie back. 
 Off we go then. 
 [man over P.A.] All passengers will depart… 
 ♪ 
 What is it? 
 I can’t go. 
 I can’t go. 
 [sighs] 
 Thank you, God. 
 [exhales] 
 For f*ck’s sake, Alfie. 
 I can’t go, but you can. 
 You have to go. 
 [chuckles] 
 Try and stop me. [chuckles softly] 
 What changed your mind so suddenly? 
 Stuff that sounds stupid if you say it out loud. 
 This is my home. 
 If that’s not worth fighting for, then what is worth fighting for? 
 Yeah, it does sound stupid. 
 We would have been good together. 
 We would. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 But in the long run, you’ll be better off without me. 
 Bit of independence is just the ticket. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 Will you be okay? 
 Mm. Mm. 
 I will be fine. 
 I always land on my feet. 
 What about you? 
 Don’t worry about me. 
 I got feet, too. 
 [chuckles] 
 [man over P.A.] Passengers for Flight 011 to Gotham proceed to immediate boarding. 
 That’s immediate boarding. 
 [exhales] 
 Hey, don’t cry. 
 [chuckles] 
 No, I’m not. 
 It’s a good thing that’s happening. 
 New life for you. 
 Here you go. 
 If you ever do get to America, you look me up. 
 I’ll do that. 
 ♪ 
 [exhales] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [chuckles softly] 
 Sorry. 
 I know you. 
 You do? 
 I don’t forget gorgeous. 
 Oh, my God, look at you. 
 I would drown kittens for those hips. 
 Patricia. 
 Melanie. 
 Fleeing from an angry lover, huh? 
 No, no, don’t deny it. 
 What else could it be? 
 We’ll sit together. You’re gonna tell me the whole sordid tale. 
 Take my mind off the journey. 
 [Melanie] Are you scared of flying? 
 No, I love flying. I don’t like airplanes. 
 My brother was supposed to come with me, but he decided to stay and be a f*cking hero. 
 ♪ 
 You’re not going? 
 No. 
 Really? 
 After all the trouble you went through to get there? Why? 
 Changed my mind. 
 That’s funny. 
 I can’t see a comical side, but I suppose there is one. 
 Why aren’t you going? 
 Changed my mind. 
 Hmm. 
 You know, Alfred, I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 
 [Alfred] I doubt it, but you never know, do you? 
 [laughs] 
 ♪ 
 [film projector clicking] 
 [Thomas sighs] 
 f*ck me. 
 My thoughts exactly. 
 Your government knows about this? 
 They’ll deny it. 
 They want the Union to use Stormcloud without their knowledge or permission. 
 Of course. They just want the damn war over. 
 Can’t blame them, really. 
 If you present the U.S. president with this evidence publicly, she’ll have to intervene. 
 She can’t be seen to stand by and do nothing. 
 She can’t do nothing. 
 At the very least, we’ll buy some time. 
 Thank you, gentlemen. We owe you a great debt. 
 I can’t believe this was an easy choice for either of you. 
 On the contrary. It was very easy. 
 I’m thinking of med school. 
 That’s a really great idea. 
 You’ll make an excellent doctor. 
 Oh, finally, I get your approval. 
 Guess I’ve been kind of hard on you, huh? 
 Kinda. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 My old friend. 
 [smacks lips] 
 So happy to have you back in the fold. 
 I’m already sorry I didn’t get on that plane. 
 And you’re still a conniving little b*st*rd. 
 Mm. Fair cop, guv. 
 Mm. 
 [grunts] 
 I’m glad to be back, too, though. 
 Mm. 
 Mm. 
 You two have history, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 [brakes squeak] 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [Sykes] Salt’s here. 
 You’re really gonna surrender to that w*nk*r? 
 Well, what else are we to do, brainbox? 
 I believe I have a better idea. 
 Oh, yeah? Now? Suddenly? 
 We kill him, right? 
 I like it. 
 No, he’ll be well protected. 
 I shall create a diversion, draw the soldiers to the front of the house. 
 Meanwhile, you two leave by the back. 
 You head for the woods, beyond the garden. 
 Should work, if we time it right. 
 A distraction? 
 Yeah. I’ll surrender and then I’ll faint or-or have a fit or something. 
 Then, if you can, you get a message to Frances Gaunt. 
 You send her my fondest love, and you tell her how deeply sorry I am for wronging her so cruelly. 
 But what about you? 
 Dearest Peg, Bet, you trust me? 
 So trust that I’ll do the right thing. 
 The greatest gift that you two can give me now is your continued survival. 
 Right. 
 [whimpers softly] 
 [door opens] 
 [sniffles] 
 Lord Harwood, John Salt here, as requested. 
 I’m very sorry we’re in this situation. 
 Let’s talk. 
 [ravens cawing] 
 [door opens] 
 Good morning, sir. 
 Silence! 
 Scum. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Soldiers of the Raven Union. 
 This man is a treacherous dog. 
 And I speak to you as your rightful leader. 
 We are fighting an unjust and unnecessary war, and we must stop. 
 I order you to lay down your arms immediately. 
 I will count to three, and any man who disobeys will be committing mutiny and sedition. 
 No! 
 One! 
 Do not fire! 
 Two! 
 Do not fire! 
 Three! 
 Onward! 
 No! 
 Get to the front of the house! Shots fired!
