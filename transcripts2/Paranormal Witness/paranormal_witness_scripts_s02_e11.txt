 I couldn't look back again. I just couldn't do it. 
 I didn't want to see that face. 
 If it was a normal imaginary friend like a rabbit or something, I could handle it. 
 Here's a guy that looks like he was attacked by a chain saw. 
 I had no control over it, like something put me in a spell. 
 Okay, I'm going to go there, like I was a zombie and I was gonna walk there. 
 [Truck honks] 
 And that's how it felt. 
 I had a feeling she was behind me. I didn't want to look. 
 [Screams] 
 [Screams] 
 Don't leave me! 
 [Upbeat music] 
 I was about 16 years old. 
 I was in high school, of course. 
 And during the summer, I worked at the University of Southern California. 
 And that's where I met my friend Alain. 
 Alain was like an older brother that I could talk to, and kid around with and make fun of. 
 And he did the same with me. 
 You're silly. 
 No. 
 Back in 1988, I was a 20-year-old college student. 
 Tina was the baby of our group of friends. 
 I pretty much was entrusted with Tina's safety through the evening. 
 I had met Alain in college in my freshman year. 
 [Drumsticks tapping] 
 We were almost like brothers-in-arms. 
 Hey. 
 We were both pretty goofy... 
 Just enjoyed getting into whatever mischief that we could get into. 
 So, guys, what are we gonna do now? 
 As any other young college boy, I was into chasing girls. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Tina was kind of a little cutie-pie back then. 
 Any ideas? 
 Al I'd known from high school. 
 We had been friends since tenth grade. 
 We were at Dodger Stadium. 
 The game had ended, and the night was still young. 
 I don't want to go home yet. 
 Exactly. 
 Tina was pretty young, so we were fairly limited as far, as where we could all go as a group. 
 I have an idea. 
 I say we hop back in the cars, go uptown... 
 Hop the fence, go up the slope, and touch the Hollywood sign. 
 Brian had suggested, hey, let's go to the Hollywood sign, see how far we can go. 
 And maybe touch the letters. 
 [Laughter] 
 Tina? 
 Come on, Tina. 
 Tina, Tina. 
 When you're that age, you always want to do something you're not supposed to and be a little bit naughty. 
 Tina, Tina. 
 Tina. 
 Okay, I'm down. 
 All right. 
 Let's go, man. 
 Alain is very by the rules. 
 And he doesn't like breaking the rules. 
 Come on, it sounds fun. 
 [Grunts] 
 It wasn't something that we should be doing. 
 That night, none of us expected to experience anything so terrifying beyond belief. 
 [Ominous music] 
 [Siren wails] 
 We jump in the cars, going down Sunset. 
 It was just a blast. 
 I rode with Alain across town. 
 It was exciting. I mean, it was just something new. 
 [Upbeat hip-hop music] 
 We'd all grown up around this sign. 
 Every time you looked up from wherever you were in the city, you see it. 
 It's like this mecca. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Bridge rattling] 
 As we got up to the top of a hill, I didn't know where Al was going. 
 But it was a cul-de-sac, kind of a dead end. 
 I found a way in over here. 
 [Drumsticks tap] 
 And there was this chain-link fence. And that's all that's separating us, and this great Hollywood landmark. 
 Uh, hey, guys, you think this is such a great idea? 
 And it said no trespassing very clearly. 
 Alain was a little apprehensive. 
 Oh, come on, Alain, who cares? 
 Let's just do this. 
 We knew that what we were doing was wrong, but that's what made it so much fun and so enticing. 
 We jumped the fence. 
 There you go, man. 
 [Grunts] 
 All right, Tina, your turn. 
 I'm afraid of heights. 
 I can't do it. It's too high. 
 Hey, Tina, come over here. 
 [Both grunting] 
 We kind of pulled the fence open a little bit. 
 At that point, I really was determined to get through the gate. 
 And hike up to the Hollywood sign. 
 That wasn't so bad. 
 We weren't supposed to be there. 
 Let's do this, guys. 
 [Branch cracks] 
 [Drumsticks tapping] 
 So we just started trekking up. 
 I myself didn't realize how steep it was. 
 Alain would hold out his hand and pull me up. 
 Like, come on, we can do it. 
 [Drumsticks tapping] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 Almost there. 
 As the letters get bigger as you get closer. 
 They just get more and more amazing. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Tina, let's go! 
 It was getting more exciting, like, we're getting closer... We're getting closer. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Sighs] 
 So we finally got to the sign. It was so exciting. 
 I was in disbelief. 
 We had made it all the way up. 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh, my God, I can't believe I did this. You know, it's like, wow. 
 Woo! 
 Yes, Tina. 
 Woo! 
 It was really incredible for us to finally, you know, be right next to something we had grown up with and looked at all our lives, that we see in movies, and we were finally right next to it. 
 All four of us had a sense of euphoria. 
 It was just, we did it, you know, we're here. 
 Wow. 
 I can't believe we did this. 
 [All sighing] 
 Great idea, guys. 
 It was just before midnight. 
 I definitely thought it was time to take Tina home at that point. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 Woo! 
 I was the first person in the line of four of us going back down. 
 [Screams] 
 [Branches cracking and rocks sliding] 
 Brian! 
 Brian! 
 Brian! 
 He just disappeared. 
 Brian. 
 Brian! 
 We could hear him sliding. 
 Where are you? 
 I could hear rocks sliding and brush crackling. 
 Then all of a sudden it stops. 
 We were all panicking. 
 Brian. 
 All three of us were calling out, Brian, are you okay? Brian, where are you? 
 Brian! 
 Where are you? 
 And he did not answer. 
 I was really worried that I had lost my friend. 
 It was really scary. 
 Where is he? 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Branch cracks] 
 Oh. 
 Come on. 
 Oh. 
 Come on. 
 Brian looked shaken up. 
 [Sighs] I just lost my footing. 
 I fell into this deep abyss. 
 And I was so scared. 
 I'm okay, though. 
 You scared us. 
 [Panting] 
 I'm good. I'm good. 
 Let's... Let's just get out of here and leave. 
 As fun as this was ten minutes ago, this actually is a little bit on the dangerous side. 
 And there's a reason that we probably shouldn't be up here. 
 The mood had changed. 
 And it became a little bit more serious. 
 It was getting too dangerous. 
 We just wanted to go back down the hill, get in our cars, and go home. 
 All of a sudden, I see this silhouette of a person. 
 [Eerie music] 
 A person, you know, coming up the path... 
 Towards us. 
 It was kind of weird. 
 We were wondering, why is this person coming up this hill alone? 
 The closer this person got, the more we realized that it was a woman. 
 She was wearing a dress. 
 Nineteen-thirty's style. 
 She had heels on. 
 Which made absolutely no sense to me... 
 A veil over her face. 
 The way she walked seemed like she was casually strolling. 
 Walking effortless up the hill. 
 Which was kind of odd. 
 Because the hill was steep. 
 Her footsteps made no sound. 
 We didn't hear anything. 
 So, you know, I decided to speak to her. 
 Hello. 
 She didn't say anything. 
 But I thought, maybe she didn't hear me. 
 And she wasn't looking at us. 
 We all kind of looked at each other like... 
 Maybe she's high, you know, a weirdo. 
 So he said hello again. 
 Hello. 
 And she didn't respond. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [All screaming] 
 [All screaming] 
 Ah! 
 [All screaming] 
 We just took off. 
 [All screaming] 
 I wasn't thinking about Alain or Tina or Al. 
 I just took off. 
 I couldn't look all the way back again. I just couldn't do it. 
 I didn't want to see that face. 
 It was just, get out of there. 
 [Screams] 
 It was just so steep, I just couldn't run fast enough. 
 My legs were going faster than my body. 
 [Screams] 
 I lost my footing. 
 I couldn't get up. 
 I turned around to see if Tina was okay. 
 [Panting] 
 Right behind her was the woman. 
 Tina! 
 [Screaming] 
 Ah! 
 [Panting] 
 [Twig snaps] Oh, my God, oh. 
 I was running because I felt like I was being chased. 
 In times of fear and you being chased by something. 
 You don't have to be the fastest guy. 
 You just have to be faster than the guy next to you. 
 [Fence rattling] 
 I literally vaulted over the fence. 
 No! 
 Al had the keys. 
 No. 
 I was ready to go, and he was the reason that I hadn't. 
 [Fence rattles] 
 Come on! 
 [Engine revving] 
 We're not even thinking about Alain and Tina so much as we are about ourselves. 
 I'm the youngest. I'm the slowest. 
 The guys were ahead of me. 
 I saw Brian and Al's car. 
 [Engine revving] 
 They were taking off. 
 As soon as I got to the gate, it was one grab for me and over. 
 [Keys scraping] 
 I'm fumbling with my keys. 
 I'm struggling to get it into the ignition. 
 I was still nervous and shaky. 
 [Keys clicking] 
 But I got it started. 
 [Engine revving] 
 I wasn't even thinking about Tina. 
 There was so much adrenaline and fear, I didn't want to look back. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Panting] 
 Ah! 
 [Panting] 
 I see Alain in his car. 
 Wait! 
 [Screams] 
 Don't leave me! 
 And I'm still on the other side of the fence. 
 Don't leave me! 
 [Fence rattling] 
 [Ominous music] 
 I didn't want to look. 
 Don't leave me! 
 My heart was pounding. 
 Wait! 
 Don't leave me! 
 [Gasps] 
 Wait! 
 Wait! Wait! 
 I was like, oh, my God. 
 I was thinking, please, don't leave me. 
 Wait! 
 I hear, wait! Wait! Wait! 
 Wait! How could you leave me? 
 You were gonna leave me? 
 [Gravel crunching] 
 You were just gonna leave? You were! 
 Tina was not just in shock but angry that we'd all left her. 
 You know, I felt guilty about that. 
 [Eerie music] 
 I had said to Al, dude, what the hell was that? 
 And he was like, I don't know, just shrugged his shoulders. 
 And we couldn't figure it out. 
 
 
 
 [Somber music] 
 None of us said the word. 
 But we all were thinking the same thing. 
 We'd all just seen a ghost. 
 After I learned about the urban legend of the lady in white, I had to learn more. 
 You know, I wanted more detail of who this was. 
 Got on the Internet and what came up was an actress... 
 Her name was Peg Entwhistle. 
 And as I read her story, it said she got a bad review in a film that she'd starred in. 
 And how she felt she had failed. 
 In 1932, she hiked up to the Hollywood sign... 
 And committed suicide. 
 [Somber music] 
 To this day, 24 years later, her face still haunts me like it was yesterday. 
 [Haunting music] 
 We moved to Yuba City in 1999. 
 I needed fresh air. 
 I needed to get away from the people pollution, and the air pollution of New York City. 
 When we first moved to the house, it was gorgeous. 
 It had a big garage, a big yard, so I thought this would be a perfect place for our dog and our daughter to play. 
 [Grunts] 
 Look at that. 
 Azha's the apple of my eye. 
 She was fearless. 
 [Car roars] 
 My biggest concern with the house was the fact that it was on a corner on a very busy highway. 
 Azha. 
 In the country on a two-lane highway, there is really no speed limit. 
 There wasn't too much space between where our front porch was and the road. 
 You can't go this far. 
 You're gonna come as far as here and never go that much further, okay? 
 But it was near good schools, and it was in a nice area. 
 Come here, Bo. Come here, Bud. 
 We had this dog called Bo. 
 By then, we'd had him three years. He was about three years old. 
 He hardly ever barked. [Bo panting] 
 [Eerie music] 
 [Bo barking] 
 [Bo barking] 
 All of a sudden he started this, like, frantic barking and barking and barking. 
 [Bo barking] 
 [Bo barking] 
 He kept barking at one corner of the yard. 
 And that corner was where the garage was. 
 [Bo barking] 
 Azha, come here with me. 
 It was a warning bark, like someone was approaching. 
 [Bo barking] 
 [Bo barking] 
 And there was no one there. 
 [Gate creaks] 
 There was a fence around the yard that was about 10 foot high. 
 I locked the gate to this fence with some bailing wire. 
 I wrapped the bailing wire around the gate about five or six times. 
 And then I twisted it and bent it over into a knot. 
 To make sure he wouldn't push the gate open. 
 It couldn't have been more secure. 
 [Bo barking] 
 He wouldn't stop, like something was wrong. 
 It just made me feel uncomfortable, a creepy feeling I really can't describe. 
 [Bo barking] 
 He was barking repeatedly just at the top of his lungs for the longest time. 
 Thomas. 
 And I was scared. 
 [Bo barking] 
 Thomas! 
 Yes. 
 Make him stop. 
 I'm not sure what you want me to do. 
 [Bo barking] 
 [Bo yelps] [Barking stops] 
 This was when things started getting a little strange in the house. 
 [Bo barking] 
 [Bo yelps] [Barking stops] 
 It was kind of a eerie silence after all the noise. 
 I was thinking, someone was touching the dog because the dog wouldn't bark if someone was touching him. 
 All the bailing wire was there. 
 It was still the same knot that I put on it. 
 [Fence rattles] 
 [Whistles] 
 Bo, where are you, Bo? 
 He wasn't in the yard anymore. 
 I started thinking, maybe somebody let him out and then tied the fence back up. 
 Bo. 
 Usually he would come charging if I whistled. 
 [Whistles] 
 And I was becoming really frightened at this point. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Whistles] 
 Bo. 
 Where are you, Bo? 
 He was lying dead on the front lawn. 
 And that's when I'd seen tire tracks. 
 Oh, my God, he got hit by a car. 
 I didn't hear any screeching of tires. 
 But it appeared something made a car veer off the road... 
 And um, hit Bo. 
 Thomas! 
 Bo! 
 Yuma fell down on her knees and started crying. 
 [Crying] 
 Azha went up to him and put a hand on his head. 
 She was calling him, Bo, Bo. 
 I don't think she understood the concept of death. 
 I thought it was gonna be a happy time and it was gonna be a new start and a new beginning for our family, but it was a horrible start. 
 And I was worried. 
 I know that the dog didn't escape from the pen unless he was let out by someone. 
 [Ominous music] 
 [Car roars past] 
 It was the very next day. It was probably mid afternoon. 
 Hey, Nick, let's talk about the colors of the marbles, okay? 
 This one's pink. 
 This one's a peachy color. 
 Can you say it? 
 I saw my daughter having a full conversation with... 
 Somebody. 
 This one's orange. 
 But nobody was there. 
 Yellow. 
 Hey, Sweetie. 
 This one... 
 Azha didn't play with imaginary people before. 
 Who are we talking to? 
 Nick. 
 I'm playing with Nick. 
 I found that kind of strange because we don't know anybody named Nick. 
 [Ominous music] 
 The following day, I asked her, Sweetie, who's Nick? 
 She was a pretty good little artist. 
 It's a mutilated body. 
 If Nick was a normal imaginary friend like a rabbit or something, I could handle it. 
 Here's a guy that looks like he was attacked by a chain saw. 
 It was a routine for me that every morning I went to the garage and would work out for at least an hour. 
 Come on in, honey. 
 And I said, Azha, why don't you come in and sit down over here on the stool, next to me, and you can watch me work out. 
 She just looked at me and very... 
 Shyly just went like this with her head. 
 Her eyes were the size of saucers. 
 And I said, what's wrong, baby? 
 And she told me that... 
 There's a bad skeleton in there. 
 A bad skeleton was the way she said it. 
 There's nothing there. 
 And she looked off into the other part of the garage and slowly lifted her hand up and pointed, no, daddy. 
 Over there. 
 She looked like she'd just seen the devil. 
 She goes, the bad skeleton doesn't like us, daddy, and it's trying to hurt us. 
 [Crackling] 
 Even though my dad was there, I didn't go inside because this thing... 
 It felt stronger than him, more powerful, like it wouldn't matter if he was there or not. 
 Whatever it was in that corner was completely terrifying. 
 [Ominous music] 
 [Clock ticking] 
 It was about 1:00, 2:00 A.M. 
 Everybody was in bed, sleeping. 
 And I had the place to myself, I thought. 
 [Clock ticking] 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Subtle sigh] 
 [Clock ticking] 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 It was a creepy sensation. 
 It felt like a spiderweb coming across my neck. 
 I spun around to look, to see what was on my neck, and, like, nothing on my hand. 
 And then as I started to relax again... 
 It felt like a hand going across my hair on my head. 
 And it was such a creepy feeling that it raised the hair up on the back of my head. 
 I've had this feeling before in Vietnam when something bad was about to happen. 
 Except for this now was in... I was in America. This was in my house. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Moans] 
 I actually remember feeling threatened for my life. 
 [Crying] 
 [Screams] 
 It was a total scream of fear. 
 I thought that something or somebody was hurting Azha. 
 Azha! What's wrong? 
 I asked her, baby, what's wrong? What's wrong? 
 The bad skeleton... 
 I couldn't see bones on it. 
 I called, whatever it was, the bad skeleton because I knew that a skeleton is not alive. 
 And this thing was not alive, but it was definitely real. 
 It was just this figure with scary eyes that were just the most terrifying thing ever. 
 [Crying] 
 I would get mad and I would cry and I would... 
 Wail because they wouldn't believe me. 
 No matter how hard I tried, they would not believe me. 
 This became a nightly occurrence. 
 She didn't even want to sleep alone in her bed anymore. 
 [Whispering] It's okay. It's okay. 
 It's upsetting to have your kid cry every night and not be able to do anything about it. 
 But I was telling myself, it's temporary. 
 She's just adjusting to the change. It'll get better. 
 And it wasn't getting better. It was getting worse. 
 What the heck? 
 My feet had dirt on them. 
 It was kind of confusing. Look at my feet. 
 It just seemed that everything was getting weird at this point... 
 The dog dying, the spiderwebs across the back of my head, the bad skeleton. 
 And now it's my wife, can't explain why she's waking up with dirty feet. 
 [Clock ticking] 
 I was staying up late because now I was concerned. 
 I was waiting for Azha to start crying. 
 I didn't want to go to sleep. I was being hyper vigilant. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 There was something in the room. 
 [Floorboards creak] 
 [Latch clicks] 
 I hear the latch to the front door click open. 
 [Floorboards creaking] 
 Yuma? 
 Her eyes were open, but she didn't say anything to me. 
 And just started trying to open the door to leave. 
 Come on, back away from the door. 
 I didn't remember how I got there. 
 I remember that I heard a voice. 
 [Ghostly whispering] Yuma. 
 It was just very strange, like something put me in a spell. 
 I'm thinking... [Sighs] 
 Maybe, you know, Azha is right. 
 Maybe there is a bad skeleton here, and maybe it is trying to hurt us. 
 There was one night when it all came to a head. 
 [Clock ticking] 
 [Water plopping] 
 [Water splashing] 
 [Ominous music] 
 [Distorted whispering] 
 [Whispers] Yuma. 
 This voice was calling me. And it was telling me, come to the water. 
 [Distorted barking] 
 Across the street, across that big highway, is a treacherous river. 
 I felt like I needed to get into the river. 
 [Water bubbling] 
 I had no control over it, like I was in a trance or something. 
 [Woman screams] 
 [Ominous music] 
 I remember the voice drawing me and calling me to the water. 
 Come in the water. 
 Come into the water to be with me. Come with me to the water. 
 [Distorted voice] Come to the water. 
 It was a very intense feeling... 
 Like I had no control over it. 
 [Vehicles roaring] 
 [Engine revving] 
 [Ominous music] 
 I wasn't afraid of the river. I wasn't afraid of the water. 
 I wasn't afraid of the voice that was calling me. 
 [Distorted voice] Come to the water. 
 It felt safe. 
 [Cars roaring] 
 [Horn honks] 
 Okay, I'm going to go there, like I was a zombie and I was gonna walk there. 
 And that's how it felt. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 I was so ready to go under the water and go in the water wherever this thing was telling me to go. 
 [Water bubbling] 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Horn honking] 
 [Brakes screeching and horn honking] 
 Yuma was not in the bed. 
 My heart was pounding. I was scared. 
 Yuma! 
 Now I'm gonna lose my wife the same way I just lost my dog... 
 Yuma! 
 On the stupid highway. 
 Maybe this evil spirit or skeleton or whatever it was, was influencing a lot of what was happening. 
 But there was something else there that protected me. 
 Something saved me from being hit by that truck. 
 I'm not really sure what it was, but it was something. 
 After that night, I saw Azha go into the garage, like she owned the place. 
 And this was after weeks and weeks. 
 This was the first time that she went into the garage. 
 And she goes, Nick's here to protect us from the bad skeleton. 
 He's the good skeleton, daddy. 
 I remember the feeling when Nick came around that everything was okay. 
 Like, nothing was wrong. We didn't feel threatened anymore. 
 I felt like I could go anywhere, and it wasn't a problem anymore because the bad skeleton wasn't in there anymore. 
 She told me that the good skeleton ran the bad skeleton off. 
 I don't know where it went, but it was only Nick now. 
 She would just start talking to Nick, like he was an old friend. 
 He had his motorcycle that he was working on all the time. 
 He was always cleaning it, always fixing it, always tuning it up. 
 After that, there was a big change in the house. 
 Azha wasn't having nightmares anymore. 
 Yuma stopped the sleepwalking. 
 I was just happy that everything was calm again and almost back to normal, except for Nick the good skeleton. 
 But then our neighbors Barbara and George told us the most extraordinary thing. 
 Barbara asked me if Azha was still having the night terrors. 
 And I told her no. 
 Now she talks about this guy named Nick. 
 He's always fixing his motorcycle in the garage. 
 She said, well, that's really funny because years and years ago... 
 We used to have a neighbor named Nicholas who rode a motorcycle. 
 [Eerie music] 
 My whole body just went cold. 
 Like, my feet were cold, and I felt kind of sick. 
 According to Barbara, Nick actually lived in this house. 
 And he was a motorcycle enthusiast. 
 [Engine clicking] 
 Coming home one day... 
 [Engine revving] 
 Nick had been involved in a motorcycle accident. 
 He had rear-ended a tractor trailer. 
 Right at the very spot where the dog was hit by a car. 
 It was the same spot where Yuma was almost run down and sleepwalking that night. 
 [Horn honking] 
 He was very badly mangled and that he died instantly. 
 When old man George told me this, it was like... 
 Sonny Liston hit me a right cross in the jaw. 
 It was a total shock. 
 It was like everything just came together like a puzzle. 
 Whether he's good or bad, that's not the point. 
 The point is that there is a spirit that's at unrest... 
 Haunting my daughter. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 We told Azha that we're going to help Nick. 
 Because he's in a dark place and he's cold and she's suffering where he is right now. 
 I am half Vietnamese. 
 The Vietnamese believe more in the spirit world than most American's do. 
 My Mother is full blooded Vietnamese. 
 She said don't worry just relax we'll do a ceremony. 
 I thanked Nick very profusely for protecting my family. 
 But now it was time to move on. 
 It was a heartbreaking feeling to know that my daughter, was losing a friend that she cared so much about. 
 I remember wanting to find him there. 
 I looked where he was with his motorcycle all the time, where he slept, where he stayed, where he usually was I could always find him there before. 
 He wasn't there anymore. 
 Just gone. 
 I couldn't even feel him not even remnants that he used to be there. 
 I just couldn't sense him anymore. 
 Nick is gone. 
 I never thought in a million years that I would have dealings with the spirit world. 
 Ghost and ghouls to me... Were Halloween fantasy's. 
 I still think about Nick, I miss him still. 
 He was my friend, he was my companion. 
 I was fond of him, he was like a bigger older brother to me.
