 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Sighing deeply] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chickens clucking] 
 Seems hotter today than yesterday. 
 Yes, Massa. 
 Sky just sits on you. 
 When I was a boy, I'd spend a day like this just sitting buck naked in the creek. 
 [Spits] 
 [Rooster clucking] 
 [Whistles] 
 [Gasps] 
 Why are you here? 
 He pretty. I wanted to touch him. 
 He could scratch the prying eyes from your head. 
 I'm gonna tell Massa Tom to beat the hell out of you. 
 Make sure you stay away from my chickens. 
 Now get! 
 [Rooster crows] 
 Mama. 
 N-Not in my front of my boy, Massa Tom. 
 Get up, George. 
 You need to learn! 
 George, what'd you do? What... What'd he do, Massa? 
 Little monkey keeps bothering Mingo, messing with my birds in the range walk. 
 Mingo's got too much work to do, boy. 
 George, them birds will hurt you. 
 You scared of them birds? 
 Then I'm gonna put your yellow ass up on the wagon when Mingo and me go out and fight. 
 You're gonna help. 
 Mingo don't like children. 
 He... He don't like people. 
 Get your clothes on, boy. 
 You look pretty in this light, Kizzy. 
 Please. He watching us. 
 Can I hold the bird, Massa Tom? 
 You do what Mingo tells you to do. 
 And you be on your best behavior, or I'll sell you to Cherokee savages. 
 Oh, Fa. 
 Papa, he trying to take my boy. 
 George : Massa Tom, why you start fighting chickens? 
 Gamecocks, George, not chickens. 
 And I fight them 'cause they're magic. 
 Carried me from a backwoods shack with 10 brothers and sisters... 
 [Snaps] Abracadabra. 
 Bought my own farm. 
 Bought my first nigger. 
 His name was George, like yourn. 
 Tough old boy. Died too fast. 
 He my daddy? 
 Your daddy's long gone. 
 No-account white man passing through. 
 Gave you that yellow skin. 
 Second nigger I bought was Mingo. 
 Best move I ever made. 
 Man : Wants this all clear by sundown. 
 See that land over there? 
 Biggest farm in Carolina ain't enough for Mr. William Byrd. 
 That b*st*rd hates me 'cause I'm Irish and 'cause my daddy was backwoods poor. 
 Thinks he knows who I am. 
 He don't know a damn thing about Tom Lea. 
 Thinks he's prince of Caswell County. 
 Hell, I'm gonna be king of Caswell County. 
 Pay what you owe, Irish! 
 I'll pay you in a week! 
 Oyez! Oyez! 
 Whoa! Hit him! Don't tickle him! 
 Ooh! 
 Oyez! Oyez! 
 The main match... a struggle to the death. 
 I give you Tom Lea... 
 Yeah! Whoo-hoo! 
 ...and Farnie Deets. 
 Man : Bring that cock to the pen, Mingo. 
 You get him, Mingo! 
 Let's go, Mingo! 
 Look at my Red. 
 You ever seen anything so beautiful? 
 Unh-unh. 
 Huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Gonna bring me luck, boy? 
 Yes, Massa. 
 Go and add $200 to my bet. 
 Bill your cocks. 
 [Roosters clucking] 
 Man : Come on now, Mingo! 
 Step back, gentlemen. 
 Come on, Mingo! 
 Step back. 
 Come on, boy. 
 Come on, Mingo! 
 Pit your cocks!

 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Man : Go, Red! 
 Come on. 
 Come on!

 And the match goes to Tom Lea! 
 Ah, yeah! 
 Yes!

 What a row! [Laughs] 
 Nobody beats my Red! Nobody beats my Red! 
 Nobody beats the Red! Nobody! 
 Yeah! 
 Good job, there, Mingo? 
 Attaboy, Mingo! 
 Yeah, Mingo! 
 Come on. 
 Hey! Mingo! 
 Oh, I love your money, boys! 
 You can all win it back at the next county fair. 
 Mingo, big Red all right? 
 [Spits] 
 Piss. 
 Piss on the damn bird, boy. 
 You sure this good for the bird? 
 You think you Massa Tom? 
 Don't ever question me about these birds. 
 I tell you to do something, you just do it. 
 Think you know. Don't know nothing. 
 Don't know the Lord gave chickens worst things in the world... pip, distemper, apoplexy, cholera, lime leg, and canker. 
 You don't know pee clean like a good turpentine. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 I don't know why we even brought you along, no way. 
 'Cause Massa Tom says I can help. 
 How? 
 I talk to your birds. 
 Talk nothing but hot air. 
 Birds use they eyes to talk. 
 Got to hold your stare. 
 Turn your head away, show you weak. 
 [Grunts] 
 Stand up. 
 Got to be a man when you messing with these birds. 
 Such a big help you is, Chicken George. 
 Patricia : "The first cut of... w-wheat is... m-most... most... f-fa... fav..." 
 What's this say, Kizzy? 
 Favorable. 
 "...favorable on a cool day." 
 Yes. 
 [Laughs] 
 Never thought nobody could learn farming by reading, Kizzy. 
 Need to read something to tell me how to act around fancy ladies. 
 Bit of gossip, weather, fashion. 
 The more you talk about nothing, the smarter them ladies think you be. 
 Whoa! 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 You won't tell Massa Tom I been teaching you. 
 Whew! 
 Why don't you pour me a drink, Kizzy? 
 Can't you see I'm parched? 
 George! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Whose blood that is? 
 What Mingo do to you? 
 I got clawed. 
 Did they hurt you? 
 Massa Tom said I held 'em real good, and they true killers. 
 Still waiting on that drink, Kizzy. 
 George, get over here. 
 I got a question for ya. 
 You want to keep fighting gamecocks with Mingo and me, or you want to get sunburned working them fields? 
 Want to work with Mingo... and you! 
 Massa, he a big help with all my chores. 
 Mama, I like them birds, and they like me. 
 Good boy. 
 Now, you know you got to sleep with them birds, too. 
 Down by old Mingo. 
 That ain't no place for no little boy. 
 Ah, you can visit him every Sunday. 
 I'm a fair man, Kizzy. You know that. 
 Be good for the boy. 
 He gonna be my good luck charm. 
 Ain't that right, Tricia? 
 Well, uh, maybe he could wait a year. 
 What the hell you know about children? 
 Since you can't have none. 
 Boy, why you still standing there? 
 Go help Mingo with the birds. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Door closes] 
 Boy's gonna be my good luck charm, Kizzy. 
 [Chickens clucking] 
 Here, boy. 
 That's bird food, Mingo. 
 Barley, milk, corn, rice, and my secret... my own brewed hops. 
 Let them niggers on the farm eat flesh. 
 What's good for birds is good for men. 
 You can game a bird for 10 years. 
 Take him from the cage, leave him one step in the trees, he gonna turn back wild just like that. 
 'Cause these birds, they from across the sea. 
 In they hearts they always free. 
 Mingo, can you teach me all about birds? 
 Teach me to fight them? 
 What you think we is, friends? 
 Come on, boy. 
 I'll teach you how to clean these cages. 
 Oh, Mama. 
 You look awful, and you stink. 
 It's the cocks. 
 Ain't no cocks in here. 
 Mama, I let all the birds free, cage by cage! 
 Big ones, Mama! 
 And fed them and helped Mingo fix them. 
 Oh, you should've seen it, Mama. 
 All these white men saying, "Hey, Mingo," patting him on his back. 
 Can you believe that, white man respecting an old nigger like Mingo? 
 And it was fun watching Massa Tom smiling and strutting around. 
 Hey, look. He gave me money. 
 Ain't nothing fun about being with that man, no matter how they make Mingo feel. 
 But Mama... 
 Come here. 
 Tom Lea ain't no better than no other Toubob. 
 No matter how much laughing they do, no matter how much you get to play with them damn birds, Mingo a slave at the end of it all. 
 And you one, too. 
 But Massa Tom likes me, Mama. 
 He don't know how to like nobody. 
 And don't nobody love ya like your mama. 
 Go on, eat. 
 Wash up. Go to bed. 
 Massa Tom like me. 
 [Bell tolling] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Whoa! 
 Uh... 
 Miss Patricia. 
 Thank you, George. 
 I'll be at the church in the trees when you want me, ready to go home. 
 Since when you a man of faith? 
 Since you seen that preacher's daughter? 
 Go on. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Excuse me. 
 Only last week, and I... 
 Morning. 
 Keep walking. 
 Patricia. 
 Mr. Byrd. 
 [Organ playing] 
 How come I always end up at the back? 
 See, the Lord say that... that he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life. 
 Man : All right, Reverend. All right. 
 But he who opens his lips... 
 Woman : Yes, sir. 
 ...shall face destruction. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Amen! 
 Amen! 
 Amen! 
 Hallelujah Amen! 
 You see, wealth gathered by vanity will diminish. 
 And see, my eyes is old, but I can see what the Lord says. 
 See, the Lord tells us beware of flattering lips and men who speak with double hearts. 
 Truth is your sustenance. 
 And beware that man who talk about money and worship money. 
 See, that, too, is vanity. 
 [Laughter] 
 The righteous man eateth to satisfy his soul! 
 But the belly of the wicked shall want chicken! 
 [Laughter] 
 And taters! 
 'Cause a full belly is a righteous belly! 
 Whoo! 
 [Bawking] Chicken! Oh, chicken! 
 Everybody need chicken! 
 I told you what I'd do. 
 You keep it up every Sunday. 
 So rude and disrespectful to my daddy. 
 Oh, Lord, help me now. I got a she-wolf on me. 
 My daddy is a kind man. 
 You just a flim-flam fool not fit to walk in my daddy's shadow. 
 Don't you have love in your heart for anybody but yourself? 
 Hang on, now. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Hold on. Hold on. 
 Move away or I'll whop you again. 
 And I deserve it. 
 Ain't got no right to be mocking your daddy. 
 He a fine preacher. 
 Look around. 
 More folks watching me than listening to him. 
 Now, if all these folk, tired from working so hard every day, will stop to hear the word of the Lord, does it really matter if it comes from the mouth of a fool like me? 
 "Thy lips are as the honeycomb. 
 Honey and milk are on thy tongue. 
 Thou art all fair, my love." 
 I heard your daddy preach that from King Solomon's songs. 
 Save your pretty talk. 
 You see me giggling and swooning? 
 Hm. I know one thing. 
 You ain't never met a girl like me. 
 Well, maybe not. 
 I'm not a pious man like your daddy, but I know you ain't let go of my hand yet. 
 [Gasps] 
 I'm George. Live on the Lea farm. 
 I know who you is, and I know all you care about is fighting chickens. 
 I do. Know about other birds, too... starling, sparrow, morning doves sing so sweet and soft, make you want to open your eyes to a new day. 
 And I'm gonna see you again, my morning dove. 
 My daddy decides who courts me. 
 Well, I ain't afraid of your daddy. 
 Then why don't you try me out? 
 Hold this, Til. 
 You got something to say to me, boy? 
 Now, I can feel the Holy Spirit right here... right now! 
 Mm! Whoo! 
 Hallelujah! You my one and only. 
 He gonna put the fear of God in them other handlers. 
 [Rooster clucking] 
 What the hell you doing, boy? 
 Letting him see me eye-to-eye. 
 I want him to know my hands till he thinks we the same, me and him. 
 Just feed him, clean him, and put him away. 
 Mingo, I got a notion from watching all these fights. 
 Keep a count. 
 Times we lose mostly when some other bird get over Massa's bird, gaff him from the top. 
 I think we need to give Massa's birds a whole lot of training for they wings, make them stronger so they fly higher, win even more than they do now. 
 I figured out special exercises. 
 You good at exercising your mouth, but you don't know birds. 
 Killing bred into the bird. 
 Don't need no wing training. 
 You don't do nothing till I say so. 
 Been doing this fore you was alive. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Rooster crows] 
 Get back here! 
 What you doing to that bird? 
 What'd I tell you? 
 You don't listen. 
 Damn fool. 
 Look how high I got him to fly. 
 Told you I could do it. 
 I know what I see. Damn truth. 
 [Coughing] 
 Want my mama to look at that cough? 
 Don't need no African medicine. 
 And don't you say nothing about this to Massa Tom. 
 [Coughs] 
 There's a gathering down by the river tonight. 
 Boys stopping by to play for everybody. 
 Come with me. 
 Don't need to see nobody. 
 Malizy said she ain't never see you come by to visit. 
 Only see you driving out or coming back here. 
 Can't stay by yourself all the time. 
 Leave me be. 
 You a shadow on a moonless night. 
 You ain't hardly here, Mingo. 
 The way I like it. 
 People say they know who I am. 
 They don't know me. 
 Say they care about me. 
 Had too many people taken away 'cause of gossip and tall tale. 
 Can't trust nobody. 
 These birds, they can cut my flesh, not my inside. 
 Trust my birds, no one else. 
 Don't trust you, neither.

 I'm tired of working land. 
 I ain't gonna wait till I'm old to rise up where I should be. 
 We need these goddamn birds to win! 
 I'll fetch the white. 
 You can bet him hard. Can't lose. 
 Nuh-unh. Use the Red for the next fight. 
 Red? 
 No. No, he ain't trained. 
 I trained him... myself. 
 You sneaking 'round 'hind my back? 
 Massa, all these birds attack head on, maybe with a little jump. 
 Now, I trained my Red out in the woods. 
 I dropped from a chestnut tree high as a hawk, so he got wings stronger than nothing else. 
 Ain't no bird gonna get above him. 
 Ain't no bird gonna beat him. 
 You think you can throw me out like some used-up old bird just 'cause you kissing Massa's ass? 
 I raised these birds since they was chicks. 
 But I trained them right. 
 I trained them better. 
 Massa. 
 I can still make you money.

 Let's see if your scheme works. 
 But, George, if you lose this fight, you can forget about me buying that Matilda gal.

 Tom Lea dreams of every penny slipped through. 
 I'm gonna win back all them pennies and more.

 Then, your Massa gonna be terribly disappointed. 
 I fight for myself. 
 Bought my papers three years ago.

 You a free man? 
 Whole lot more than just me. 
 Durham, Fayetteville. You'll find us. 
 But, yeah, I'm free. 
 Till some sheriff wakes up in a bad mood, has a sore tooth. 
 Being free takes a watchful eye, but I prefer it to the alternative. 
 But how'd you get the money? 
 Kept my hand in my own pocket, coin by coin. 
 Went without a lot of things. 
 Kept looking ahead, not regretting what got left behind. 
 Way you carry yourself, I thought for a minute you was free, too. 
 I got a good Massa. 
 Good enough to let you buy yourself? 
 He is giving you a fine cut of his winnings.

 Mr. Lea, as one gentlemen to another, I'd like to buy the boy from you. 
 Buy my George? 
 I inquire merely because I understand you've acquired debt on your farm for equipment, seed, and stock. 
 What happened to your nigger? 
 I heard he was a good man with the birds. 
 Boy forgot his pass while traveling to buy gamecocks for me. 
 Patrol scared him. 
 He ran, and they shot him. 
 Sorry for your inconvenience. 
 Name your price, but I'd have this boy. 
 No. 
 Not now. Not never.

 That's if we come to a decent price. 
 Then you can move that gal...

 Mrs. Shubal, breakfast looks delightful, does it not? 
 Man : It's a beautiful day, isn't it? 
 My favorite holiday. 
 Mr. Lea, Miss Patricia. 
 Morning, Reverend. 
 Your hat, sir? 
 George, what are you doing? 
 Well, there's Tom Lea and his lovely wife, Patricia. 
 Good morning, Mr. Lea. 
 Good morning, Mr. Jewett. 
 Mrs. Lea. 
 Morning. 
 Woman : Good morning, Mrs. Lea. 
 Morning, Mrs. Jewett. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Please, allow me. 
 [Chuckles] Thank you, Mr. Jewett. 
 There you are. 
 Now, our table is complete. 
 Mama, this is Marcellus, free man I told you about. 
 I'm not sure which one of y'all is the bad influence. 
 I'm not sure anyone has much sway over your boy. 
 Seems like his spark can dazzle anyone. 
 Now it's obvious he gets that from you, which makes his daddy a lucky man. 
 My mama lives alone. 
 Just like I like it. 
 I'd never have some man bossing me around, acting like he my second massa. 
 Ma'am, there are two things I'll never understand. 
 A man who mistreats a woman who loves him. 
 That's one. 
 Oh, the other would be a man who can't appreciate a woman who knows her own mind. 
 I thought you were a free man. 
 Who's freely deciding to carry this tray for a beautiful woman. 
 Anyone can see that Jackson is too boorish to be president. 
 He's a warmonger and an adulterer. 
 Only ignorant men without land or education would back him. 
 Tom. 
 I say Old Hickory's gonna be a damn good president. 
 He'll protect cotton investors clearing out woods in Mississippi and Alabama. 
 Yeah, I'll vote Jackson. 
 My point proven. 
 This country will sink into a cesspool if we keep giving lowborn men a vote. 
 Woman : We're going by train to New York to visit my cousin. 
 Her husband has a position with new clothiers... 
 Mr. Lord and Mr. Taylor. 
 But she warned us that the streets are foul with horse droppings and Irish. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What have I ever done to you, sir? 
 I pay no attention to you at all... sir. 
 I offer conversation and good cheer on a fine holiday. 
 And yet you poke, poke, poke me like a damn hog. 
 [Laughs] 
 I demand you tell me why. 
 Take your hands off me. 
 Let's go. 
 Can't stop these men once they start. 
 I have no idea if they're clean. 
 God damn me. 
 On Easter Sunday, in front of my wife and these good people. 
 [Screams] 
 Look at me, Byrd! 
 I see you clearly, sir, exactly as they all see you. 
 You bungle you farm till it's near in ruin, waste your money on drink and gambling. 
 Earn a penny, spend a dollar... 
 Oh, that's the Irish. I know them. 
 Scrub all you will, sir. 
 The dirt is not under your nails, sir. 
 It's in your soul. 
 And I'd dine with niggers before I'd dine with you.

 Get off of me! Get off me! 
 Get your hands off me, you son of a bitch! 
 I'll geld you, you b*st*rd. 
 You need to come home, Massa! 
 I'm worth 10 like you. 
 You never did a hard day's work in your life. 
 Soft hands, like a woman. 
 You think your money makes you a man? 
 I'm the only real man in this goddamn county. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 I do not settle my battles with fisticuffs like some drunken bar brawler. 
 You settle this however the hell you will. 
 For what? Act like a gentleman. 
 Allow me satisfaction in the field... a duel. 
 Face-to-face. 
 Whenever and wherever you say.

 George, I need you to do this for me. 
 I depend on you. 
 Yes, Massa. 
 Patricia. 
 Can't no slave be 'round no white men when they get like this. 
 Massa Byrd can kill you without thinking. 
 And ain't no sheriff gonna do nothing 'bout it. 
 Kizzy, he can't say no. 
 Yes, he can. 
 But he too caught up and concerned about that no-count cracker and his birds. 
 What you think gonna happen if Massa Tom get killed? 
 Think Miss Patricia gonna sell us all together? 
 She gonna run off to the woods she came from, and we gonna end up on paddle-wheelers for cotton Mississippi. 
 Why can't you understand? 
 You can't risk your life for that man. 
 Not for him... for us. 
 I need to keep Tom Lea alive for us. 
 George. 
 Not by chance, not any of this. 
 There's the man wants your massa dead. 
 Massa Jewett? 
 If Tom Lea is killed, he's gonna buy your son. 
 Tom Lea made a mistake refusing his offer for George. 
 And the thing about rich white men, they'll take 10 steps at a tilt just to take one step straight to what they want. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 Mingo : Whoa. 
 You think you doing this for your family. 
 But I known you since you was a little boy. 
 I know the love you got inside you for Massa. 
 You thinking maybe one tiny piece of him inside the same. 
 Make you as stupid as he is. 
 He ain't never gonna see you for what you truly is no matter what you think. 
 Pardon me if I don't wish him luck. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 [Smooches] 
 I'll look after him. 
 Less likely to string the two of us up, but I've been wrong before. 
 High card will decide who fires first. 
 You will then separate and face each other. 
 On my command, you will each discharge your pistols in succession. 
 If you both remain alive, you will proceed with swords until one of you is dead. 
 Five diamonds. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Three clubs. 
 Mr. Lea will shoot first. 
 And may God have mercy on your souls.

 This your day. 
 Take your time. 
 Got to wait till your eyes see clear, breathing even. 
 You hear me? 
 Take your time. 
 I know, George. 
 I intend to kill him with my first shot.

 You're my only true friend. 
 Do this friend a favor. 
 Kill that son of a bitch. 
 Your first shot, Mr. Lea. 
 Still shaking, didn't even take aim. 
 Mr. Byrd. 
 First shot.

 Goddamn. This can't be. 
 Aah! [Grunts] 
 You do this next shot right, now. 
 Take your time. Nice and steady. 
 If you niggers interfere, we'll kill you!

 Get right at him. 
 No! Get away.

 You got to fight hard if you want to stay alive. 
 Now get on your damn feet! Get up!

 That's how we'll bury you if you want, deep in the damn dirt! 
 Mr. Lea, do you yield? 
 George, it hurts so bad. 
 Oh, you in the pit now, Massa. 
 Want to let him jeer you, throw you carcass in a dung hole? 
 Step back, boy! 
 Rise up high. You the gamecock now. 
 Get up, George.

 Win every cock fight, make you real rich. 
 I got to know a time gonna come when I can buy me free.

 When the number's right, I promise I'm gonna write those papers for you.

 No, you can't kill him. 
 'Cause then they gonna kill you, and that would rip me apart. 
 All I know is how to make all this livable. 
 And can't do that no more. 
 I almost took my life when you was born. 
 And yours, too. 
 For a while, I didn't know how to feel nothing. 
 Nothing but shame and sorrow. 
 And so far away from my mama and daddy, but it would have been a terrible sin against everything my daddy taught me. 
 It seemed like I could hear his voice right here stopping me. 
 He came to me, and I decided to live. 
 You a fine man, George. 
 And I ain't told you enough. 
 Maybe I was scared you got too much of Massa's blood. 
 But you have honored my father. 
 You here to keep this family going, to survive. 
 He always said we fight when we need, but first, we got to survive. 
 Tom Lea whole life gonna be a waste, but not yours. 
 What keeps me living. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too much. 
 Stay with me. 
 Please. 
 Live. 
 [Chickens clucking] 
 [Rooster crows] 
 Oh, uh, Mingo wanted you to have this bucket with his secret feed in it. 
 Hey, that's too heavy for you. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [Slaves singing indistinctly] 
 [Baby crying] 
 Kizzy : George, you and Matilda got two girls and two boys, and ain't none of them named Tom yet. 
 I ain't giving them that man's name. 
 Mama, you said... 
 I know what I said, and I knew what he'd do if you don't name that boy Tom. 
 He'll ride him the rest of his living days. 
 Do it, George. 
 Name him Tom. 
 Tilda. 
 Morning Dove, you need to rest. 
 And I want you to name him the way Mama Kizzy says her daddy taught her. 
 The way Kunta Kinte would do it. 
 I know I didn't pay it no mind with all our other babies. 
 It ain't the way my daddy taught me. 
 But I heard Mama Kizzy telling the stories to the boys one night. 
 Something passed through me, George. 
 I don't see how both ways... mine and Mama Kizzy's... can't be true. 
 And I believe it will protect this baby and all of us. 
 I don't know how. 
 Moving too fast for me, Mama. 
 I ain't hardly trying, George. 
 Like I say, them birds a soft kind of work. 
 Here. 
 How you know it's the right spot? 
 I know.

 Gonna be more money at that Charleston jamboree than we ever seen, and I am gonna win it.

 After George leaves, get the children weaving new grain baskets. 
 Ashford and George Jr. can start clearing out that stand of walnut trees. 
 Matilda : Yes, ma'am. 
 How we looking, George? 
 George : We got 10 strong killers, five young stags hungry for blood. 
 I say we be fine, long as you listen to me. 
 Can't ever talk to me like that, George. 
 Goddamn. 
 I swear I'll sell your ass in New Orleans. 
 And fight your own birds. 
 Look, George, there's more money to be won in that Charleston jamboree than we ever seen, and we got to win big. 
 That's what we'll do. 
 George, you and me used to be best friends. 
 Ever since Mingo died, I can barely get a word out of you. 
 It's a long road to Charleston, Massa Tom. 
 I'm gonna go help our boys in the field. 
 I'll bring back gifts for everybody, my morning dove. 
 Just bring yourself home safe. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 You ain't never been gone this long before, George. 
 Well, got you to watch over everybody. 
 Ain't got no worries.

 There's more money here than I ever thought could be. 
 Where we going, Massa? 
 [Clears throat] 
 Here he is, Jewett. 
 Oh, Chicken George. 
 Meet my cousin from Hampshire, Sir C. Eric Russell. 
 Jewett tells me you're a sovereign of avifauna. 
 I look forward to testing your prowess against my birds. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Tom Lea and I have wanted to settle once and for all who's best in our noble sport. 
 But it's gonna cost you to find out. 
 Mr. Lea, while I understand your confidence about a bird or two, I did not get wealthy by betting small. 
 A man who bets a mere thousand here or there is a man who won't risk enough to take what he wants. 
 Or perhaps Chicken George is only a small-time fighter. 
 Oh, you ain't never seen a fighter like me before... sir. 
 $10,000. 
 Plus side bets. 
 Accepted. 
 [Cheering] 
 $10,000 it is. 
 And, boys, I'll be open to all offers. 
 [Spits] 
 Gentlemen. 
 Feel good about the birds? 
 Best I ever felt. 
 Today's the day, George. 
 I'm gonna rise up above every man who ever looked down on me. 
 $10,000? Massa, you ain't got that much. 
 Don't matter how much I got if we win, do it, George? 
 Besides, my farm's worth half that much. 
 No. 
 Can't bet our home. 
 Not where my family live. 
 You win this for me, and I'll set you free. 
 I swear. 
 Write it. 
 Write that paper, right here. 
 Be waiting for you when you're done. 
 This ain't no dream, George. Wide awake as I ever been. 
 We're gonna be rich, just like I said. 
 Who that Englishman think he is? 
 How dare he fight us. 
 We faster, smarter, stronger, prettier. 
 Insult to be in the same pit with you and me. 
 Come on now, you little b*st*rd. 
 I gave you blood and sweat. 
 Make George a free man today. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 George. 
 Man : Oyez! Oyez! 
 Our final pair of the Charleston Main! 
 A heavy match of birds. 
 Six pounds four, Sir C. Eric Russell of Hampshire, England. 
 And Tom Lea of Caswell County, North Carolina. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Gentlemen, face your birds! 
 Come on now, George!

 Glad y'all made money.

 Know Kizzy been teaching you. 
 It looks fine. 
 [Laughs] It look real fine. 
 Sir Eric : Your man has a rare skill. 
 Plain to see. 
 And yet why do I feel like a marionette, my strings pulled by a clever manipulator. 
 Did you set me up, Mr. Lea? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You challenged me. 
 I had the courage to take it, and I had the man to win it. 
 Then I assume your courage will permit me an opportunity to recoup my losses, penny for penny. 
 Well, even an Irishman understands fair play. 
 Sir Eric is willing to wager another $10,000. 
 [Crowd murmurs] 
 Can your damn English cousin handle $20,000? 
 [Crowd murmurs] 
 I relish the opportunity. 
 Done.

 Come with me, cousin. 
 I have something I want to show you.

 George. 
 I don't know what happened. 
 We need to set up another fight. 
 They gamed us, George, like fish at the end of a line. 
 I lost everything... every penny. 
 Look, George, the farm ain't gonna cover my bets. 
 Ain't even gonna cover what I borrowed against it. 
 I'm ruined, but that English b*st*rd's offering me a way out. 
 [Sighs] 
 Said he never saw a man with a touch for the birds like you. 
 Said you was a magician. Used that very word. 
 What you saying? 
 [Sighs] 
 Not to drag it out, that Englishman will call me even if I give you to him... take back to England. 
 England?! 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Now you ain't making no sense. 
 Train his birds and his handlers. 
 I don't understand the hell you saying to me. 
 I'm free! That's what we agreed. 
 Money was in my hand, George. 
 What's worse than being rich for one day? 
 You can't tell me to leave my family! 
 I ain't going nowhere for you, you understand me?! 
 I'm sorry, George. 
 I ain't got no other way to survive. 
 The time will pass like a summer squall. 
 No, you b*st*rd. I am a free man. 
 You ain't free, George. 
 Not unless I register them papers with the county. 
 Now I will tell you something. 
 When you come back, I'll have papers for your whole family waiting in a lockbox. 
 I'm not going! 
 I'm tired of explaining it to you! 
 I don't have to give no damn explanation to no damn slave! 
 Sir Eric's carriage is leaving. 
 Do not resist. Do not waste his time. 
 You can't do this! You hear me?! 
 I earned it! I'm free!

 You don't love nothing but money and a whiskey jug!
