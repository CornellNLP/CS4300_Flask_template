 Your name is Toby. Now tell me your name. 
 Kunta Kinte. 
 That's not your name! 
 [Screams] 
 And I will name you Kizzy. 
 I think I was selfish to have you born into a world like this. 
 You trained me well. 
 Woman : Kizzy! 
 [Crying] 
 Kizzy! 
 This is my right! 
 Help me! 
 I'm gonna name you after my daddy... 
 George Lea II. 
 [Crowd chanting "Chicken George"] 
 George : Come on. What you got, boy? 
 I got to know a time gonna come when I can buy me free. 
 I don't see why not, George. 
 And I'm gonna see you again, my mornin' dove. 
 [All cheering] 
 A name is who you is. 
 My daddy took whippings to protect his name. 
 You get to making babies, Tom would be a fine name for a boy. 
 Just bring yourself home safe.

 You win this for me, and I'll set you free. 
 I swear. 
 [Roosters clucking] 
 [Man speaks indistinctly] 
 That Englishman will call me even if I give you to him... take back to England. 
 England?! 
 Get this nigger off of me! 
 Who gonna watch my family? 
 Tom Lea! [Grunts]

 Man #1 : £100 on the red. 
 Man #2 : £200 on the white. 
 Man #3 : £500 on the white. 
 Man #4 : Yeah, yeah, I cant take some bets. 
 Alex : Mandinka say, "Everything that enchants also deceives." 
 I'm not sure which is more exotic... your bird or your nigger. 
 Now, would another £10,000 clarify the issue? 
 Done. 
 Excellent. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 All right, there he is. 
 We're stronger, faster, smarter, prettier. 
 Insult to be in the same pit with you and me. 
 Now, what you gonna do about it? 
 [Rooster clucking] 
 [Laughter] 
 Whoo! 
 Ladies and gentlemen, America is a wild and dangerous land. 
 One time, I saw a Carolina bobcat drag a man high up a hickory tree, and two minutes later, his skeleton fell back down. 
 [Laughter] 
 Flesh picked clean. 
 Just raining bones. Clickety-clack. 
 I've been chased by savages, painted faces. 
 Alex : After he was sent off to settle a gambling debt, Chicken George won nearly every match. 
 The English loved him, and he fell into his old ways playing to the crowd. 
 Let me tell you now, I have wrestled mountain men big as bears. 
 They all naked. They men parts covered only by their beards. 
 [Laughter] 
 Chicken George! 
 All : Chicken George! 
 You've served me well, George. 
 And I want to assure you when I've earned back the money Tom Lea lost to me, I will send you home a free man. 
 Just wanted to know, sir. 
 When would that be? 
 Sir, how much longer I got... 
 I will tell you when the time is right. 
 Alex : By the time Sir Eric set him free, George had been in England for over 20 years... no longer enchanted, no longer deceived. 
 ♪♪ 
 Man : Stand at the gate. 
 [Baby crying] 
 Traveling homeward, George felt the past surge around him. 
 He remembered how Kizzy said Kunta Kinte came to visit her, but George was afraid that his vision would mean something different... that his seven children would think of him as little more than another story. 
 Or worse, that they had forgotten him altogether. 
 [Woman singing indistinctly] 
 [Singing continues] 
 Did you fall? 
 I just sit away from the trees, feel the light on my face. 
 [Resumes singing] 
 Miss Malizy? 
 It's George. 
 George? 
 Chicken George. 
 I'm back from England. 
 George? 
 Come on now. Let's get you up. 
 [Humming] 
 [Creaking] 
 [Continues humming] 
 Where is my family? 
 I know where your mama is. 
 Kizzy got a pain in her side. 
 She knew she was dying. 
 Mama. 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mama... 
 [Trembles] 
 [Sniffles] 
 Miss Malizy, I'm gonna look around. 
 Then I'll gonna come back and take you with me. 
 Oh, no, sir. No. No. 
 I got a right to be here. 
 I worked this ground every day of my life. 
 I got a right to be buried by Kizzy. 
 Miss Malizy, I got to go look for my family. 
 You ask Master Tom? 
 Tom Lea's still alive? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Chickens squawking] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gun cocks] 
 I'll shoot you, nigger, right here. 
 Let my chickens peck at your cold, black body. 
 I know you're here to rob me. 
 But I reckon I could kill you first. 
 Kill your own baby boy, Massa Tom? 
 I know you? 
 Sure you do. 
 [Gasps] 
 All right. 
 George? 
 My George? 
 You come back for me, George. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Insects buzzing] 
 You say his name Benjamin Murray, Alamance County? 
 Murray. Benjamin Murray. 
 That's who bought my children? 
 He an engineer at the Fayetteville arsenal. 
 That right? 
 Needed the money, George. 
 How could you leave me? 
 Oh, I didn't leave you. 
 You sold me to pay a gambling debt, just like you sold my children. 
 I taught you everything. 
 It's all right. 
 Got you a life with fancy folk in England. 
 What did I get? 
 Patricia run off. 
 Whore. 
 Old niggers can hardly work. 
 [Chuckles lightly] 
 Who's gonna look after me, George? 
 Who's gonna cook and clean? 
 Who's gonna obey me? 
 You said you'd leave papers for my family, so they free. 
 You swore that to me as they was dragging me away! 
 Said you'd set my wife and all my children free. 
 So did you write them papers for my family? 
 Where are they? 
 [Panting] 
 You a man without honor, Tom Lea. 
 You walked your feet out them dirt hills. 
 Not your filthy soul. 
 You and me have the same blood, boy. 
 I'm your daddy. 
 No, the blood in me from Kizzy, not you... blood that kept me strong all these years away. 
 What few good things I done, that the blood of my granddaddy. 
 And every damn bit of foolishness in me, everything weak, everything selfish... that's you, Tom Lea, 'cause that's who you is. 
 You ain't smart enough to change yourself. 
 And the truth is, your whole damn life, you was a slave, too. 
 You just never knew it. 
 God damn you. 
 Tom? 
 Tom! 
 Oh, Tom! 
 Mama, what you doing out here? You got to get to work. 
 I need you to stop at the Barton farm on your way back. 
 See Old Man Augustus. 
 He... he sells that special chestnut tea for asthma. 
 Mama, I'm not passing that way. 
 Besides, Massa Murray knows how many stops I make. 
 Son. 
 I'll work fast, mama. 
 Bring some back for you. 
 Hey, now you got to get to work. 
 You got a big heart, like your daddy. 
 I ain't like my daddy. 
 I'll never do nothing foolish to make Massa Murray angry, get myself sold away. 
 You just get home safe. 
 It only takes one crazy redneck, and Massa's road papers don't mean nothing. 
 Just look after Irene and that baby in her belly. 
 Now, get going now. 
 [Clicks tongue] Hyah! 
 [Metal clanking] 
 Business used to come to me in bunches. 
 Now with all this war talk, can't keep my shop open. 
 It ain't safe to be a colored free man in Carolina no more. 
 Ain't never been safe to be a slave. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I hear Mr. Murray send a fine blacksmith like you all over the state, Tom. 
 He pay you a little? 
 I need to finish up with you, man. 
 Come on out here, boy. 
 [Door creaks] 
 This boy a runaway. Stay up here mostly. 
 I tell folks he's my slave. 
 Some freemen keep niggers, too. 
 How long you been hiding? 
 August be seven whole years. 
 Seven years? 
 My brother and me ran away from Chatham County. 
 He got caught, but they didn't see me. 
 I hid in the bushes. 
 Saw them patrol boys hang him. 
 When I passed by here, Orly let me hide. 
 I'm leaving the state soon, and this boy ain't got no papers, Tom. 
 You got a pass lets you go anywhere. 
 Name's Winslow. 
 Just get me by the docks at Elizabeth City. 
 Gonna sneak on a barge going north. 
 Can't help. 
 Massa Murray knows how long it takes me to make my rounds. 
 Got a clock for a heart. 
 Besides, I need to earn money for my family, buy them free. 
 Can't I be free?

 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 What's this place? 
 Crossing into Duplin County. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Come on, now. 
 You got no papers, and I ain't got no way to prove you working with me. 
 So best take off now. 
 Can't just leave me out here. 
 You lucky I took you this far! 
 [Horse neighs] 
 And if they catch you, you better not tell nobody my name, understand? 
 Come on. 
 Get in them trees now! 
 Hyah, hyah! 
 That's far enough! 
 Just stop there! 
 If I can just explain. 
 That's far enough. 
 I see that pistol in your waist. 
 You put it down, or I'll swear I'll take it from your dead body. 
 Toomey, what's all the fuss? 
 Nigger has a gun. 
 I got a reason to be here. 
 If I can just speak to Mr. Murray. 
 I'm his son. 
 First, you need to prove to me you ain't here to cause trouble with our niggers. 
 Who is it, Frederick? 
 We got a smart-mouth nigger came strolling on the farm in his fancy clothes like he's paying a social call. 
 Got a fancy gun, too. 
 For all I know, he's here to provoke an insurrection. 
 Hey, you know that old boy? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 But he remind me of a man about to die. 
 Benjamin, is there trouble? 
 Oh, it's nothing to concern yourself with, Charlotte.

 Tilda, if this man is your husband, you will see him after the workday is done.

 You are so much more beautiful than I could possibly bring to mind.

 You just as pretty as the sunrise. 
 Almost pretty as me.

 Ashford's our family cat. 
 Can't stay home at night. 
 Well, we'll just have to tie a bell to his paw so the gals can hear him coming.

 Oh, you James. 
 That's right, Daddy. 
 Boy, you was thin-boned as a sparrow when I left. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Massa let a doctor come by here? 
 Massa Frederick won't pay for no doctor. 
 Says we need to use our own ways. 
 I don't need to see a doctor, Daddy. 
 I feel stronger every day. 
 And this is Irene, Tom's first baby. 
 Got that Cherokee hair. 
 You don't seem so high-strung like she say. 
 And you don't seem so foolish and no-account, like my Tom says. 
 [Laughter] 
 Where's Tom? 
 Why ain't he standing by you with that big belly? 
 Massa Murray says Tom is the best blacksmith in Carolina. 
 Rents him out all over the state. 
 Helps Massa Murray build his guns. 
 Gets paid, too. 
 Saving to buy us free. 
 A slave never can pay enough. 
 Never. 
 Where are my other children? 
 George Jr., Louis, and Mary got sold off a few weeks after we came. 
 Massa Murray said he sorry, but he couldn't keep all of us. 
 We tried to keep in touch with them, Daddy, but, uh, ain't none of them in Carolina no more. 
 It's my fault... all of it. 
 Now, you listen now. 
 I put my trust in false things. 
 Thought I'd put on a show for the massas, they act kindly. 
 Thought they money and hurrahs mean respect. 
 I was a damn fool. 
 I'm gonna keep this family together, just like my mama Kizzy wanted, just like her daddy, Kunta Kinte before her. 
 Now, Daddy been gone a long time. 
 That ain't never gonna happen again. 
 Woman : Mississippi, Florida, Alabama have done their sacred duty to join South Carolina in secession. 
 It is time for North Carolina to stand up and join her brothers. 
 They printed your entire letter, darling. 
 We'll vote war, and sooner than later. 
 Charlotte : Frederick, so many boys will die. 
 Lincoln is weak. 
 He won't dare send his soldiers so far away from home. 
 And if he does, in two weeks, we'll declare victory. 
 North Carolina will reward the men that led us to freedom, turn to them for leadership for a new country. 
 Secession isn't something everyone wants. 
 It's too extreme. Common sense can still prevail. 
 Common sense abandoned this country long ago. 
 Why should New York and Boston and Philadelphia tell us how to live? 
 They don't understand. 
 There is no South without slavery. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Haven't I found my match, Mother? 
 Benjamin : Commence firing! 
 Cannoneers, cease fire! 
 Service the piece. 
 Cannoneers, load! 
 See, Massa Murray runs test for the army. 
 Advance the round! 
 Guns and cannons, bullets, too. 
 Says if war comes, Southern boys gonna need to make their own guns. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What's your brother Tom gonna do with all this? 
 See, Massa Murray asks his opinion all the time. 
 If something gets made by hammer and fire, Tom's the one massa depends on. 
 Benjamin : Cannoneers, commence firing. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 Watch out for Frederick, though, Daddy. 
 He part cannon hisself. 
 Never know when he going off. 
 Cannoneers, load! 
 Sorry I'm late, massa. 
 Just got back. 
 Your father's been anxious to see you. 
 My father? 
 Chicken George ain't no cock-and-bull story, boy! 
 Here's our daddy hisself. 
 He's got lots of real good stories to tell, too. 
 Got no time for stories. 
 Got too much work now. 
 Frederick : Daddy. 
 We're getting quite the collection on the farm. 
 Every nigger but the Lost Tribe of Israel. 
 How long you plan on visiting with us, Chicken George? 
 Oh, I ain't visiting. 
 I told Mr. Murray I'm living here now with my family. 
 Mrs. Murray relies on Matilda. 
 Having your father here has... has brightened her mood. 
 Ready. 
 That's a great kindness, sir, to be with my children again. 
 Cannoneers, commence firing! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Ho, ho, ho, ho. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 Benjamin : Is everyone all right? 
 Breech exploded. What went wrong? 
 Need more precision on the ball. 
 Ain't truly round. 
 How the hell do you know that? 
 By my hands. 
 Nonsense. 
 Bamboozle my father. 
 You lie to me, I'll string you up by your toes. 
 Collect the pieces. 
 Ashford, get over here and help clean this up. 
 Mr. Murray think real highly of you, son. 
 I keep on his good side. 
 Ain't no good side for no slave. 
 Any good side dry up faster rain in a summer field. 
 Bet on it. 
 Betting is your game, not mine. 
 If Massa Murray want to play papa to me, I'm gonna let him. 
 Do anything to make it easier for my family. 
 Ain't every nigger get made the fool by his white daddy. 
 [Waltz playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 There we go. 
 There she is. 
 Woman : Bring another plate out here. 
 [Sighs] 
 You can't slow down? 
 Miss Nancy's barkin' orders like she runnin' the farm already. 
 She can bark all she want. 
 We just got to see if her bite is bad as his. 
 Her folks here? 
 Both her folks died and left her a place in Raleigh. 
 She a book-smart lady. 
 Frederick fell for her as easy as a slip on a river rock. 
 What's wrong, son? 
 Them boys right there... 
 They Mr. Frederick boyhood friends. 
 They ain't even gonna let Abe Lincoln on a ballot in North Carolina. 
 [Applause] 
 [Slow waltz plays] 
 That's my mama's song. 
 Every band in the county plays it now. 
 It's changed some but always the same. 
 I can hear mama Kizzy humming it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 These folks don't know where it come from. 
 Well, we do, Mornin' Dove. 
 Dance with me. 
 George. We ain't allowed. 
 Oh, I'm allowed to dance with my wife. 
 [Laughs] 
 It's been years, George. 
 [Waltz continues] 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Nancy : Come on, honey. Let's go back in. 
 Stop it right now. You shouldn't be around here. 
 You know Massa Frederick don't like you around here. 
 Boy, why don't you worry more about they working your Irene too hard? 
 Go ahead, ask Massa Murray to let her rest till the baby come, since he looking out for you now like a father. 
 Or maybe I'll just buy my Irene free with all that money you won in England. 
 Both of you, stop this. 
 I got to get back inside to Miss Charlotte. 
 [Sighs] 
 Every penny I saved to come home to my family. 
 Hallelujah! 
 Like mama's daddy used to preach. 
 The old massa sent me to England. 
 I ain't got no choice. 
 I was a slave. What else could I do? 
 All I ever heard was how you wanted to gamble your way to be free. 
 Ain't the truth, Daddy. 
 You liked it. 
 [Applause] 
 Ain't no right way to be a slave. 
 Only thing they ever gonna understand is this right here. 
 You old fool! 
 You keep flashing that gun around, and we'll both be hanged from an oak tree. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Think I don't want to take my hammer and cave in a man's head who spits at my brothers or... or insults mama? 
 But what happens next? 
 After they kill me or... or sell me? 
 Who watches out for the family? 
 But that was never you, Daddy, 'cause you... you had to be Chicken George, livin' the sportin' life. 
 [Waltz continues] 
 Let me hold your hand. [Chuckles] 
 You know who holds hands? 
 Mandinka warriors from Africa. 
 They're the strongest, toughest boys in this whole world. 
 You got to teach my baby, too, Daddy. 
 Don't you worry. 
 I got lots to teach you about Kunta Kinte. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 As your lawyer, I'd prefer you to refrain from shooting Chicken George. 
 A trial requires my valuable time, even played as a farce. 
 Here's where you say you have a smarter idea. 
 [Chuckles] I have a smarter idea. 
 North Carolina law's clear. 
 Now, freedom granted to any slave shall be upon the expressed condition that he leave the state within 90 days and never return. 
 How long has he been on your farm? 
 Over two months now. 
 On the 91st day, you can seize him and sell him. 
 Why quibble over days when you can just take him? 
 No, no, keep it by the book. 
 Old Chicken George will find out I'm a bag of nails compared to my father. 
 You leaving here tonight. 
 I'm right where I should be. 
 Is this all the bread you could find? 
 Frederick and his friends ate through the pantry like a plague of locusts. 
 Matilda, hold on. 
 James will drive you to the Durham road. 
 And don't go waving these papers talking about you free. 
 Might as well throw a stone at a wasp nest. 
 Get the small cart ready. 
 We won't tell your brothers or your sisters until your daddy is far away. 
 I ain't leaving. 
 Hey. 
 Mr. Murray ain't that bad, and as for Frederick... 
 And I'm telling you Massa Murray grows older every day. 
 Can't control Frederick. 
 He is as bad as they come. 
 He'll make your life a torment, then sell you Mississippi way or kill you. 
 I ain't scared of that boy. 
 I can't leave you again. 
 And I won't. 
 No. 
 I prayed so hard that you would come back, and we'd be free together, even after Massa Murray sold the children. 
 But if we can't be free together, at least you'll be free. 
 I know what Mama Kizzy would say. 
 Do what your grandfather would do. 
 Keep moving north, and don't ever look back. 
 Promise me. 
 I promise. 
 For now I'll go. 
 I don't know how, and I don't know when, but I know I will be back for this. 
 And next time, I ain't wavin' no papers to be free. 
 Ain't asking no permission from nobody. 
 Next time, my Mornin' Dove, I'm coming to take you.

 I want every penny you earned on this farm as a blacksmith. 
 Made a lot more money for this farm. 
 Goodbye, sir. 
 Son, son! 
 You think anything's changed 'cause the war's over? 
 Frederick, please. 
 Them Union boys gonna be home soon enough, but I'll still be right here, and plenty of men just like me. 
 We will redeem this country and put you people back where you belong. 
 It's just natural law. 
 I won't never see a nigger be my equal. 
 Don't have no interest in being your equal, Frederick. 
 Charlotte : No, no! 
 F-Frederick! 
 Oh, my god. 
 [Crying] 
 [Panting] 
 First thing good my daddy ever did for me. 
 Yeah, we're ready. 
 All right, baby. 
 Woman : Are you guys ready? 
 All right, let's get the kids in there.

 Well, Chicken George, I reckon it's time I be moving on. 
 I thank you kindly for everything, and you... you're all nice folks. 
 But after all, you... you's all family. 
 And you're not my family. 
 We are now, if you want us to be. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, that doesn't sound so bad, now does it? 
 Not bad at all. 
 Can I come in? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.

 Matilda : It's all right.

 Get back. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 W-what do I do, Daddy? 
 Tell me now. What... 
 How do they... how do I... give her her name the right way? 
 Son, I can't... 
 I can't say I know for sure. 
 Just talk to her. 
 I don't know any Africa words. 
 I don't know if this is the right time, or I don't know if the sky looks the way it's supposed to be, but... 
 I know you my first baby not born a slave. 
 First baby nobody can own. 
 But that don't mean you don't have to be a warrior. 
 Still gonna have to fight to stay free. 
 Every day. 
 Always gonna be someone wants to take away your freedom. 
 And I can't keep this family together if I don't teach you where we come from, who we are... if I don't remember who I am. 
 So that's why I got to tell you this story... so I can be the father I want to be.

 Alex : His name was Kunta Kinte, son of Omoro and Binta Kinte from Juffure in the Kingdom of Niumi on the Kamby Bolongo. 
 Flying home from The Gambia, I knew I had to write a book about him. 
 My ancestors would be a symbol for millions of slaves, all of them seeds of American families living today, captured, chained, sailed across the same ocean in ships where untold numbers died. 
 Sold to thousands of plantations, millions of men and women who struggled to survive and fought to be free every day.

 [Man chanting in native language] 
 The truth can never be known. 
 It can only be told in a story. 
 There once was a boy who was taken from his family and carried halfway around the world. 
 He lived to start a new family. 
 And in his journey, he became a hero for a new nation. 
 I hope my story honors him, brings peace and pride to us all.
