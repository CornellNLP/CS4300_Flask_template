 Alex :  This is how I heard about the boy, Kunta Kinte. And this is how I'll tell you the story. 
 [Woman singing indistinctly] 
 The two most important days in a man's life are the day he is born and the day that he understands why. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Man groans] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 There was once a rich and sophisticated city named Juffure in a Mandinka kingdom in West Africa. It was located on the banks of the Kamby Bolongo, the Great River of the Gambia. 
 [Woman singing indistinctly] 
 Like the Greeks, Romans, and Hebrews, Mandinka kept slaves as servants. Some slaves married into these families, others paid ransoms to be free. 
 ♪♪ 
 Then Europeans arrived in great sailing ships. Some Mandinka were corrupted by European guns and gold, creating a violent market for slaves. But the many Africans who fought European plundering suffered brutal reprisals. Kunta Kinte's family were warriors loyal to the king. On the day that Kunta was born, the Kinte family had a violent clash with their rivals, the Koros... 
 [Man shouts indistinctly] 
 ...who were loyal only to their greed. 
 [Man shouting in Mandinka] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Groaning] 
 It would take Kunta a long time to understand why he was born into this world, but when he did, it was as clear as the sky above the Kamby Bolongo. 
 Permission? 
 I do not need permission. 
 The king needs my sons and I to support him. 
 The king knows you sail upriver to buy slaves at favorable prices. 
 He knows you're trading them for English guns. 
 None of this is your business, Omoro Kinte. 
 We control who goes up and down the river. 
 For our Mansa, the king. 
 [Grunts] 
 Aah! 
 [Screams] 
 Do not sacrifice your sons for your own greed!

 Sitafa : Back to work, Jinna. 
 And I don't see many oysters in your basket.

 Kunta, don't bother with that girl. 
 Soon an older warrior will take her for his bride.

 If I didn't ask you to speak, why do you keep saying my name? 
 I'm dying of thirst. 
 Aah! Is there water?! 
 Man : Of course there is water. 
 If I had run as far as you, I would want water, too. 
 But what you want is of no importance. 
 I am your Kintago! 
 All : Peace be with you. 
 Kintago : [Speaks native language] 
 And with you. 
 May Allah's mercy rain upon you. 
 You will need it. 
 Your lives will be measured by what you do now. 
 Only the bravest will be selected to become warriors to serve your king. 
 But if you fail, no woman will bear your children. 
 You must leave Juffure and live your days somewhere else. 
 Now stand up! 
 Line up! 
 And shut up!

 You will live there like the old Mandinka way in warm, comfy lean-tos.

 [Horse whinnying] 
 Kitango : For a Mandinka warrior, one horse is worth 20 men in battle. 
 I know you have been taught to ride by your family, but not a horse like this. 
 He is a king of a royal line that goes back to the great kings of Mali. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 Who will ride him? 
 Kunta volunteers. 
 But I don't see a saddle or reins. 
 This horse will never allow a boy like you to put a bit in his mouth. 
 And what if your enemy took your saddle? 
 Would you try to run without your horse? 
 Silla : Hands up together. 
 But how will I hold on?

 This king of horses has made you all look weak, unprepared. 
 You have far to go if you want to be called a Mandinka warrior. 
 This horse could feel your fear because you are only thinking of yourselves, not about the horse. 
 [Man singing in native language] 
 [All singing in native language] 
 [All grunting] 
 Kintago : Are we moving? 
 Why do I still feel we are on the riverbank? 
 Faster. 
 If we met an enemy, this would be a canoe full of dead warriors. 
 My hands are like monkey paws. 
 Faster! Faster! 
 Paddle! 
 [Horn blowing] 
 You hear that? 
 [Horn blows] 
 The enemy approaches. 
 We must stop the enemy on the river, or he will kill you and attack your families. 
 This can't be real, is it? 
 Your weapons are at your feet. 
 But these are not sharpened. 
 Oh. 
 Did you all forget to prepare your weapons in advance? 
 There is a word for a Mandinka who is unprepared in battle. 
 A slave. 
 I see them. 
 It's only Master Silla. 
 Addo, stand up. 
 Use your javelin. 
 Attack your enemy before he kills you. 
 What if I hit Master Silla? 
 A warrior who hesitates is a dead warrior. 
 Throw now. 
 [Grunts] 
 Aah! 
 Kunta! Up! 
 If you cannot fight your enemy across the river, you will be killed! 
 Taken as a slave! 
 Kunta : [Grunts] 
 [Grunts] 
 Kintago : I will not tolerate your insolence. 
 You disobeyed my order. 
 I instructed you to use your javelin. 
 Instead, you insulted Silla Ba Dibba, your teacher. 
 I defeated my enemy. 
 Kunta Kinte, we will see if you are as good as you think you are. 
 You will be given a head start. 
 If you make it back to our  jujuo  before the others catch you, you can continue your training. 
 But if you are caught, you will fail your training. 
 You will never become a warrior, and you will be banished.

 You sure the dead man was from Juffure? 
 Kunta : Yes, Uncle Silla. I knew him. 
 His name was Musa. 
 His family trades rice and oysters. 
 His neck was tied like a goat. 
 The Koros have gone too far. 
 First they defy the king and sell slaves from upriver without permission. 
 Now they're taking our own to sell for guns. 
 Brother, it's too dangerous to be this far from Juffure. 
 Especially for our sons. 
 The Koros can take them as hostages and hold them for ransom. 
 We must fight them, Fa. 
 It's far easier to rush into fighting than to stop it once it starts.

 Kintago : He is asking you a question. 
 What is the warrior's first responsibility? 
 To serve his king.

 His line traces back to the great herds of the Sahara. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 If I accept this horse... must I stay in Juffure? 
 I don't understand. 
 Juffure is our home. 
 Why would you leave? 
 To study in Timbuktu. 
 Then we'd never see you again. 
 Binta : That's true. 
 It is very, very far, Kunta. 
 I need to know if I can attend university. 
 Test myself against the best students in the world. 
 Timbuktu is a giant city with aggressive and ambitious people where boys fight like dogs to be accepted in the university. 
 It'll be my own fight. 
 You would do this to your mother? 
 I won't allow it. 
 Are you ordering me to stay? 
 I want you to perform your duties to this family like I did, like my father did, and his father before him. 
 I won't always be there to clean up the trouble you cause, Kunta. 
 Listen to your elders. 
 Stay here. 
 Stop filling your head with dreams.

 Tabitha : Mama! 
 [Door opens] 
 John : This one is easily spooked. 
 Elizabeth. 
 I told you, this is no place for my wife. 
 And I almost obeyed you, darling. 
 I only came to find Fiddler. 
 Fiddler : Massa Waller. 
 Yes. 
 They told me that you wanted to see me. 
 They didn't tell me why. 
 Connelly here tells me that you knew the African girl over at the Randolph place. 
 I wouldn't say I knew her, Massa. 
 We didn't do much talking. 
 That was years ago. 
 Fine notion, sir. 
 Fiddler knows his way around an African. 
 Let him handle the boy. 
 John. We spoke at length. 
 No more purchases for a while, and look what you did. 
 Brother, I do not like holding so much of your debt. 
 What on earth are you talking about? 
 I'm gonna get 30 years good service out of him. 
 And I have money in my pocket from selling the niggers that he's replacing. 
 Fiddler : Massa Waller, that's a brand-new Guineaman. 
 It's a mighty responsibility. 
 Much more responsibility for an overseer than it is for a fiddle player like me. 
 No, no, Fiddler. He's yours starting today. 
 And if the boy proves to be recalcitrant, then he'll go in my pocket, too, courtesy of the Georgia man, same as Samson. 
 What are we calling this one? 
 William : Does the lady have a proposal? 
 Hey. Hey! 
 In Dorset, we had an old slave in the stables. 
 Don't you  ever  look at my wife. 
 He taught me to abandon sidesaddle. 
 Sit astride a stallion. 
 Call this one Toby. 
 Named after the horse or the slave? 
 Both. 
 Come along, Connelly. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Come up to the house as soon as you're finished. 
 I want to hear all about the Albrights' party. 
 Mrs. Albright put on a barrel of weight. 
 Look like a newborn calf at the udder. 
 I knew it. I want all the details. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 You're hurt. 
 It's nothing to fuss about. 
 William. 
 William : Hmm? 
 Yes, that could go septic. 
 I'll attend to you up at the house, Fiddler. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 Damn Albrights. 
 Playing for six hours. 
 Asked the oldest son if I could take some time to rest 'cause my fingers were clawing up. 
 Spoiled boy took my hand, held it over a candle flame. 
 I still had to play more tunes. 
 But you a tune I never was expecting to play. 
 Just calm down! Calm down. 
 Calm down. 
 Why you think that overseer got Massa to give you to me, huh? 
 'Cause overseer know that you're gonna take off again. 
 Then the Massa, he gonna have to blame me. 
 I'll end up like Samson, going out Georgia way. 
 You gonna start working today. 
 You'll be planting a new tobacco field. 
 Try to say this word. 
 Tobacco. 
 Tobacco. 
 Tobacco. 
 That's right. 
 Tobacco like a hole in a water bucket. 
 Makes a... makes a field run dry. 
 Run field dry. 
 It's gonna be a long summer. 
 Killing heat, biting flies. 
 Stay light so long, it seem like the night gonna never come. 
 I'm gonna get Miss Elizabeth to hand you back over to the overseer. 
 I got me a nice, warm spot like an old hound right there at the fireplace by her feet. 
 I ain't gonna let no Guineaman get me kicked back out to that field. 
 You understand me, Toby? 
 Kunta Kinte. 
 No, no, listen to me. 
 Massa's wife done named you Toby. 
 Kunta Kinte.

 I remember that. 
 Thank you, Fiddler. 
 Your boy ain't keeping up, Fiddler.

 Connelly : Next time he doesn't answer to Toby, you're the one gets a beating. 
 Let's go right now, ask Miss Elizabeth what she think about all that. 
 You think she can keep you safe? 
 Like the Queen of England. 
 Ain't just Toby don't know who he really is. 
 Fiddler : You think that Mandinka god hear you? 
 Best thing to forget all that. 
 White folk don't like no Africa god. 
 Get you in bad trouble, Toby.

 I can't believe I got to ride 10 mile, then I got to work all damn night.

 Prodigy just mean that she... she... she rent me out and she keep all the money.

 Kunta : [Singing in native language] 
 What's that tune? 
 [Singing continues] 
 Long time ago... 
 I swear that my grandmama sang that... 
 'fore I got sold. 
 There was a man on the farm, played this old Africa guitar. 
 He... he... I think he played it, too. 
 No guitar. 
 Kontingo. 
 I've been chasing that tune i-in my head for... a long, long time. 
 You must be putting that Mandinka magic on me. 
 Making me think of too many things tucked away real deep inside. 
 My mother sings this to me... every night when I'm young. 
 It's a real pretty song. 
 I'm gonna figure it out. 
 Maybe build me one of them... 
 Fiddler : ...Africa guitars. 
 This song is mine. 
 Nobody in this place can have it. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay.

 No, no, no, I did my best.

 Fiddler : Miss Elizabeth being really kind to you. 
 That's her favorite horse.

 Why are you making me wait after all I do for you? 
 Get the boy to take my horse to the stable now. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 He's gonna do it. I promise. 
 Just got to, uh, be a little patient with him, that's all. 
 Stop protecting Toby. 
 You pick up those reins and tend to my horse. 
 John : Is there a problem here, my dear?

 Fiddler. 
 What road is north? 
 Just follow the dead niggers hanging from the trees. 
 Get you right there. 
 [Sighs] 
 I can't stay here. 
 When right time come, I go north. 
 Ain't no right time. 
 Overseer could walk backwards and catch you in them irons. 
 And the day you run, that's my last day on this farm. 
 Besides, can't just fly off north like a bird. 
 Country ain't like it used to be. 
 White folks cutting down old trees fast as they can and putting up new houses. 
 You got to twist and turn your way to get there. 
 And paddyrollers on the road all the time just hunting for niggers like you. 
 I'm not scared of paddyrollers. 
 Stupid never scared. 
 Of course, ain't that many paddyrollers on the road around Christmas. 
 A man could vanish before anybody could tell he gone. 
 And the Massa be having a grand celebration for the baby Jesus. 
 Everybody occupied then.
