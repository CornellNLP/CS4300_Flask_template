 [Sobs] 
 No, no, no, sir. It is not my fault. 
 You leave her unsupervised with the nigger girl. 
 She used your house as her schoolroom. 
 And now, in addition to all the storm damage I have suffered, I've lost a valuable slave, my Noah. 
 And you shall be compensated. 
 Compensated? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Brother, you are a man of debt, not assets! 
 Doctor. 
 Belle. 
 William : [Sighs] 
 Now, you've worked for me for a long time, Belle, since I was a young man, and I can honestly say this is a day I hoped would never come. 
 What day, Massa? 
 I've just received this road pass, forged by Kizzy to Noah, so that he could escape. 
 No. 
 Yes! 
 No, no, that can't be true. 
 Yes, it appears that somebody's been teaching her to read and write! 
 What are you waiting for? Come along, gentlemen. 
 Do not tarry. Take this girl away! 
 Missy! 
 I'm very sorry, Belle. 
 Missy! 
 No. 
 No, I'm very sorry, Belle. 
 No. No. No. 
 No! 
 Missy! 
 No! No, Massa! 
 Missy! 
 Get back! 
 Missy, you've got to help me! 
 Please! Please, Massa. 
 You've got to help me! 
 Please, Massa, don't take the only child I got left, Massa, please! 
 Help you?! How could you do this to me?! 
 After all these years, after everything that I've done for you! 
 And I was gonna ask Mama to buy you. 
 We could have stayed together forever. 
 Massa, please. 
 Please! 
 I would have kept you safe. 
 How could you do this?! 
 [Door opens] 
 You brought this upon yourself. 
 Off with her. 
 And upon your poor family. 
 [Door closes] 
 No! You brought it on my family! 
 William : Take her away. 
 You brought it on my family! 
 Oh, take her away. 
 Massa! 
 What a mess. 
 I beg you, please, Massa... wait! No! 
 Please! Please, listen to me, Massa, please! 
 I beg you, don't do this, please! 
 Get off of me. 
 I promise, Massa, please, don't do that! 
 Please! Please! 
 Don't you touch me! 
 Kizzy! 
 What a mess! 
 [Kizzy screams] 
 Oh! What a mess. 
 I know Missy is your child. 
 Hmm? 
 Now you stop this or I will tell your brother the truth. 
 Oh, go on. Tell him about his wife, me and his wife. 
 Slander his wife to his face, and we'll see how quick he is to wrap a rope around your neck and hoist you into a tree! 
 Did you really think a nigger could accuse me, a white man, of anything at all? 
 Oh, get out of here, you wretch. 
 Go, go. Go. 
 [Belle and Kizzy screaming] 
 Kizzy! Kizzy! 
 Easy, Belle. 
 Kizzy! No! No, no! 
 My baby! Kizzy! 
 No! No, Kizzy! 
 [Screaming, crying] 
 My baby! 
 Toby. 
 Kizzy! 
 Kizzy! 
 Get ahold of yourself. 
 No! No! 
 Mama! 
 [Screaming, crying] 
 Stop! Let her go! Please! 
 Fa! Fa! 
 My baby! 
 Kizzy!! 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Man vocalizing] 
 Fa! Fa! 
 Kizzy!

 Whoa, nelly! 
 Now, this ain't the house that Jack built. 
 Though you sure do look like a maiden all forlorn. 
 Bet you never heard that nursery rhyme, huh? 
 This is the man, all tattered and torn, who kissed the maiden all forlorn.
