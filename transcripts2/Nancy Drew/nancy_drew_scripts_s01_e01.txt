 Nancy Drew  -   01x01   - Pilot    
 (WATER WAVES CRASHING)   
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC)   
 CHILDREN:  Lucy Sable once was able to look upon the sea.   
 (WIND RUMBLING)   
 But someone got her in the water.   
 (SNAPPING NEARBY)   
 CHILDREN:  Now that's where she'll always be.   
 (SCREAMING)    
 NANCY:  Horseshoe Bay's most infamous Sea Queen wore her crown for only one night.   
 CHILDREN:  Count to five, enjoy the view.   
 Hope the killer doesn't get you!   
 NANCY:  People say she still haunts our town.   
 CHILDREN:  One, two.   
 BOTH: Three, four, five.    
 You'll never get out of here alive!    
 GIRL: You're our Sea Queen, Nancy Drew.    
 Seriously, guys?    
 - Yeah, put it on there. 
- Yeah. You have to put it on the gravestone, or else it's not official.    
 Come on.    
 GIRL  : Now you're one of them.    
 - Ooh! You are now. 
- All hail the Sea Queen.    
 - Yeah. All hail the Sea Queen. 
- (YELLS)    
 (SCREAMING, LAUGHTER)    
 I totally got you.    
 Hey, are you all right?    
 Look like you saw a ghost.    
 NANCY:  But I don't believe in ghosts.   
 I believe in looking for the truth.   
 Hey, where are you going?    
 NANCY:  My parents called it curiosity.   
 - (GASPS) 
-  Said I was just born that way.   
 But I know that's not the whole story.   
 It's just a dream, sweetheart. 
Here, take Mommy's flashlight.    
 NANCY:  It wasn't a dream.   
 But what was it?   
 After that night, I began to chase the shadows.   
 And Horseshoe Bay had a lot of them.   
 WOMAN:  Rose?!   
 - WOMAN: Rose? 
- Rose?    
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER)    
 Rose?    
 MAN: Want every vehicle cleared!    
 NANCY:  When a local child went missing,   
 the whole town went looking,   
 but I'm the one who saved her.   
 I found Rose Turnbull behind a hidden staircase.   
 I ended up getting grounded, but it didn't matter.   
 I was hooked.   
 Mysteries were everywhere, and I loved solving them.   
 It was more than just a hobby.   
 It was part of who I was.   
 (KATE CRYING)    
 We'll get a second opinion in Boston.    
 Dad? Mom, what's wrong?    
 Mom?    
 But then life dropped a real mystery into my lap.   
 One that couldn't be solved.   
 _    
 I don't go searching in the dark anymore.

 No offense to all the Neds out there.   
 All I know is that when I'm with him,   
 I don't think of anything else,   
 and that's a good thing.   
 Sorry. I, uh, never do this.    
 Huh. You say that every time.    
 Also never thought I'd be wearing this.    
 I'm not exactly where I thought I'd be, either.    
 And that would be freshman tailback for University of Florida, which is where I'm from, if you're curious.

 But at least he doesn't judge me

 Since when does George need help with anything?   
 This place isn't the Hamptons.     
 No, it's not the Vineyard, it's...     
 Do you remember that town in  Jaws?   
 Yeah, it's like that, but with no shark.     
 At least the shark made things exciting.     
 I got to go.     
 Is this okay?     
 Can you bring me a glass of white?

 So, what do you five have to say?     
 I'd ask you to check the cameras in the storeroom, because I'd totally be on there, time stamped, looking for wine.     
 But we don't have any cameras in the storeroom.     
 I was in the ladies' room, and it's a single stall, so, yeah... by myself.     
 I already said the repair shop was closed.     
 I figured that implied it was empty.     
 That's why I was headed here for dinner.     
 Ryan Hudson can verify my whereabouts.     
 I delivered food to him and his friends when the lights went out.     
 Yeah, since the waitresses were nowhere to be seen.     
 Not that I think they did anything wrong.     
 I found her.     
 My fingerprints will be on her plate.     
 Other than the person who may have done this,     
 I believe I was the last one to see her alive.     
 Ace here has an alibi.     
 - What? 
- Bring the rest down to the station.     
 Tell Mr. Hudson and his friends they are free to leave.     
 Why don't they let us go already?     
 (SIGHS)     
 They're trying to decide if we're just witnesses or if they have enough to charge us.     
 Charge us? With what?     
 The death of Tiffany Hudson.     
 Hey, Nancy.     
 Karen. Hi. Um, I was just...     
 She's "Detective Hart" in here, FYI.     
 Can we go now?     
 We've told you all we know. 
We're not suspects.     
 I disagree with your opinion.     
 I'm looking at a decent four-pack.     
 Town screwup, ex-con, city girl, and...     
 Nancy Drew.     
 Why does he say your name like that?     
 She used to complicate my job.     
 You mean do it for you?     
 Ah, Ms. Fan.     
 I haven't thrown your mom in the drunk tank this month.     
 - How's she doing? Say hi. 
- Mm.     
 And for the rest of you...     
 It-it was one count of shoplifting.     
 I never did any hard time.     
 Didn't say you did.     
 - But good to know. 
- By "ex-con",     
 I meant him.

 Happened when I was a minor.     
 Record's sealed, and time served.     
 You never told me you went to jail.     
 One of the many things you never asked about.     
 Oh... so this is a  thing.   
 What concerns me is why you aren't questioning Ryan Hudson.     
 In a case like this, you have to look to the husband first.     
 Thanks for setting me straight.     
 Maybe you can share more of your theories in my office.     
 Everyone else, you can go.     
 There were no signs of trauma, so maybe Tiffany had a health condition or a drug problem.     
 I mean, maybe foul play isn't even involved.     
 We're pretty sure it is.     
 OPERATOR:    . What's the nature of your emergency?

 Please. I'm at The Claw.

 I didn't see anyone, I swear.     
 HART: I believe you, Nancy.     
 Look, I loved your mom like a sister, and I know you wouldn't do this.     
 But a socialite killed on parade night, we-we have to solve this case fast.     
 (ECHOING): It's not...     
 Her ring.     
 She was wearing it when I first came out, but not when I found her on the ground.     
 Yeah, well, someone like Tiffany Hudson would have a very nice ring.     
 Could be a game changer for anybody.     
 Maybe help your dad.     
 Medical bills do add up.     
 Wow.     
 So now my mom dying is somehow a motive for murder.     
 And I thought you wanted my help.     
 Look, if you're not charging me, then I believe I'm free to go.     
 But don't go too far. 
You're still a suspect.     
 So are your friends.     
 They're not my friends.     
 Karen was totally out of line calling you.     
 I didn't ask for a lawyer.     
 How about a father?     
 You're still living under my roof.     
 That's more than I can say for you.     
 - I've just been buried at work. 
- Poor word choice,     
 - given recent events. 
- Hey, you know how much I treasured your mom, but that doesn't mean, now that she's gone,     
 I don't have to attend to everything I neglected.     
 Does that include your daughter?     
 Nancy.     
 At least let me drive you home.

 Glad that murder didn't affect your appetite.

 Usually, Nancy brings me one, but this morning she didn't show.     
 I thought maybe learning about my past might have scared her off.     
 I thought that you were gonna wait for me at the police station so you could explain... more fully and in private.

 Oh.

 He seems to have an issue with me not acknowledging this publicly, and has decided that now is the time to rectify this.     
 Consider it rectified.     
 I feel much better.     
 Other than the fact that we're all murder suspects, even though the real culprit is probably Ryan Hudson.

 Look at the husband first.     
 We need evidence of his motive.     
 Which we'd find where?     
 In their house.     
 In their room. Husband and wife, it's an intimate relationship.     
 I mean, to start, were they even sharing a bed?     
 Well, if she liked her s*x like she liked her fish... that'd be dry and flavorless... so I would say nope.     
 - Mean. 
- But relevant.     
 Is either of them on medication?     
 Is there a secret cell phone? Is there a new will?

 Gambling debt. A strange addiction.

 Wait. Maybe Tiffany was like Bess.     
 If she believed in ghosts, she could've tried to communicate with one.     
 Or protect herself from one.     
 Even though that's crazy. Also like Bess.     
 If this medium met with Tiffany for any reason, that's a lead worth following.     
 Then, great, let's go.     
 Uh, guys? I, uh... tend to do these sorts of things by myself.     
 You wouldn't even know about that medium if it wasn't for my extensive knowledge of maritime lore.     
 Plus... you don't believe in ghosts, which a medium will pick up on right away.     
 Admit it, Drew.     
 We're helpful.     
 NANCY:  I admit nothing.   
 Just follow my lead.     
 NANCY:  Can you just tell us  about Tiffany Hudson?     
 A séance isn't necessary. And... if I could just ask you a few questions?     
 I brought a notepad. (CHUCKLES)     
 Nancy, just sit down and let her do her little show.     
 Just ask her questions after.     
 - It's ridiculous. 
- (WHISPERS): It's awesome.     
 It was expensive.     
 HARRIET: Best not to keep the dead waiting.     
 Now you can ask your questions to Tiffany directly.     
 BESS: Oh.     
 Do you ever moisturize?     
 - (WHISPERS): Shut up. 
- HARRIET: Don't break the circle.     
 Stay focused.     
 Close your eyes.     
 Now breathe together.     
 In... and out.     
 In a welcoming state.     
 - Tiffany. 
- (WHISPERS): Tiffany.     
 - Tiffany. 
- (MOUTHS)     
 Repeat after me. Spirit... we welcome you.     
 OTHERS: Spirit, we welcome you.     
 HARRIET: Breathe it.     
 Mean it. Let her in.     
 - OTHERS: Spirit, we welcome you! 
- We have many questions.     
 But first... do you have anything you'd like to say to us?     
 (RASPY BREATHING)     
 (RASPY BREATHING CONTINUES)     
 (LOUD BANGING)     
 (GASPING)     
 Find the dress. Find the dress.     
 Find the dress!     
 (GASPS)     
 (PANTING): Get out.     
 That wasn't supposed to happen.     
 - What? What wasn't? 
- I heard a voice, from the dead.     
 You're a medium. Occupational hazard.     
 Whose voice? Whose dress?     
 That wasn't Tiffany.     
 (EXHALES) That was Dead Lucy.     
 It's a black hat. Could be anyone's.     
 HART: It's cashmere. Cable stitched.     
 Kate knit it for Nancy when she went on that sixth grade camping trip to Shadow Ranch.     
 Not to mention the long red hair inside.     
 You found this at Ryan Hudson's house, and now it's here on my coffee table.     
 Yes. I took it from a crime scene     
 - and now I'm giving it to you to destroy. 
- Karen,     
 - you could lose your job. 
- And Nancy could lose a hell of a lot more.     
 I don't think she had anything to do with Tiffany Hudson's murder.     
 But trying to prove her innocence is gonna end up making her guilty.     
 I don't know what to say.     
 How about you let me make sure no one ever finds this?     
 Hey.     
 Thank you.     
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)     
 NANCY: What the hell?     
 Nancy.     
 Karen was here with evidence that you broke into Ryan Hudson's house.     
 And as my lawyer, you're willing to do anything to protect me?     
 Don't turn this around on me.     
 Your father is worried about you, Nancy, and so am I.     
 Not just as a police officer but as a friend.     
 A friend?     
 Is that what you are?     
 Is that what you were to my mom?     
 This isn't how I wanted you to find out.     
 That makes two of us.     
 - I'm gonna go. 
- Actually, don't bother.     
 I was just leaving.     
 Need to get myself some new legal representation.     
 If only I could get myself a new father, too!     
 Nancy!     
 Let me explain! Nancy!     
 All this time, I thought you were devastated,     
 - and instead you were hooking up? 
- You're right.     
 I haven't been honest about Karen.     
 I was trying not to upset you, which I realize I still did, so... let's talk about it.     
 Okay? All of it.     
 There's nothing to talk about.     
 I'll reapply for school and get the hell out of here, and you can get back to your secret life.     
 Nancy.     
 Wait!     
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR)   
 (CRICKETS CHIRPING)     
 Nancy?     
 You okay?     
 Yeah, totally. Hi.     
 I've wanted to believe that this isn't my life.     
 That I'm not here, that my mom isn't dead, that Columbia is not just a pipe dream. (SNIFFLES)     
 But all of those things are true.     
 This is my life... and... the only thing making it any better is you.
