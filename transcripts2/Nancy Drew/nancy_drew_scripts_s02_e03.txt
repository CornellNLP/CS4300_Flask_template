 (DISTORTED, ECHOING TICKING) 
 NANCY:  Every one of us lives with a clock.   
 Most of the time we don't hear it tick.   
 _    But when the end is near,   because you and your friends made a bad deal   with a vengeful sea spirit,   and she's coming to kill you in three days,   that ticking clock drowns out everything else.   
 Here. 
 Quaint carriage house, furnished. 
 You should look at this. 
 Okay. 
 So, Nancy's tracking the only known Aglaeca survivor, and... 
 what are we doing? 
 We're doing this. 
 First you were on my couch and then Nancy's couch. 
 It's time for a place of your own. 
 Three days, George. 
 Three days to beat the Aglaeca or die trying. 
 Is finding me a rental really a priority? 
 It is to me, okay? 
 This is my way of telling the universe that in three days life moves on and we're still gonna be here. 
 I'm buying green bananas. 
 Don't try to tell me otherwise. 
 NICK: Oh, my God. 
 BESS: They're buying produce, and you're washing dishes. 
 Near the death cooler with the meat hooks. 
 Great. 
 Should you even be here? 
 - I tried staying home. 
 - (SIGHS) 
 But my mom is out of town, my dad and I just argue, so this feels a lot better. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Um, since I have you, I have an idea. 
 So, Lucy's bones are what got us here in the first place, and-and I know that Nancy wants to bury her mum, but... 
 what if we just give the bones back to the Aglaeca? 
 What are you saying, we just throw the bones back into the sea, and the Aglaeca calls off everything? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, bingo. 
 No more death sentence. 
 Wait. 
 Look. 
 I... 
 I did some research, and I found dozens of cases throughout time. 
 Okay, the binding tablets of Macedonia, the stones of St. Anne's Well... 
 it's all here. 
 Like a curse reverse. 
 Yeah. 
 - Okay, let's ask Hannah Gruen. 
 - Okay, good. 
 But even if we want to do it, we don't have all the bones. 
 What? 
 The day that we put Lucy's skeleton back together, - there was a piece missing. 
 - Yeah. 
 A piece of Lucy's skull. 
 I-I... 
 I found it, and I hid it from Detective Tamura. 
 I-I thought you took it. 
 No. 
 - (SIGHS) 
 - So... none of us have it? 
 - What, Tamura found it? 
 - Yes! 
 Of course Tamura found it! 
 Okay, he already doesn't like us, and now... now... he's gonna think we're grave robbers and-and bone smugglers... 
 Let's try to live long enough for Tamura to be our biggest problem. 
 I'll get the bone. 
 You go talk to Hannah. 
 Yes, okay. 
 - Welcome to Lily's. 
 Can I help you? 
 - Well, um... 
 Oh, you're Lily. 
 Ha. 
 - Great name for a florist. 
 - Yes. 
 - Almost like I had no choice. 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 Um, I was visiting the grave of a dear friend the other night, and I noticed that somebody left this beautiful wreath of white roses. 
 The groundskeeper told me that it came from your shop. 
 I would just really like to issue a thank you. 
 Um, if-if you could give me their name or their phone number, maybe... 
 Oh, no, that's legally impossible. 
 Legally? 
 Is there some kind of florist-client privilege I don't know about? 
 Well, in here there is. 
 The answer's no. 
 Was there anything else? 
 No. 
 I'm just gonna look around. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Lily's Garden, can I help you? 
 I'm getting married this afternoon, guests. 
 My florist was just extradited. 
 Can you help me? 
 Oh, I would suggest zinnias, dahlias and English daisies. 
 I'll go count. 
 Oh, big day. 
 Big, big day. 
 _    Come on, give me something. 
 Bingo, a phone number. 
  You have got to be kidding me. 
 (SIGHS) 
  (LINE RINGING) 
  CARSON: Hi, you've reached the law office of Carson Drew. 
  NANCY:  Carson Drew, the gift that keeps on giving.      ♪♪      
  -     GEORGE:  Your dad Carson?   
  Carson Drew sent the flowers to the victims? 
  Yep. 
 And he's been doing it every year for over a decade. 
  How many secrets can one guy have? 
  What about AJ? 
  There's no mention of AJ, just the note that went along with the flowers: "Forgive me, Kitsune", and Carson Drew's phone number. 
  So the only connection we have     to the sole survivor of the Aglaeca... 
  Is the one guy that I don't know if I can have a conversation with without losing my mind. 
  Yeah. 
 So that's why I'm meeting him in a public place,     right here, and you guys... 
  We're like the ambulance on standby at the Indy    . 
  Exactly. 
  (BELL JINGLES) 
  If everything goes up in flames, get me out of there. 
  How are you? 
  Why do you send flowers to the same five graves at Hillside Cemetery every year on the same day? 
  - What? 
 - Five graves. 
  Hillside Cemetery... every year. 
  Do you know what I'm talking about? 
 Yes or no? 
  Yes, but... 
  that's what you want to talk about? 
  I was hoping that maybe you were ready to... 
  Oh, I don't know if I'll ever be ready for that. 
  The guy that sends the flowers' name is AJ. 
  Are you sending the flowers for AJ, or are you AJ? 
  AJ Nishiyama. 
  He goes by AJ Crane. 
  You've probably seen his books. 
  AJ Crane, the horror novelist? 
  I was his lawyer years ago, briefly. 
  I arranged for that delivery. 
  White roses every year on Harbor Day. 
  Why was his lawyer doing his flower purchasing? 
  Because AJ was a total recluse, even back then. 
  He bought an old hunting cabin up in the woods, almost never left it. 
  Refused to deal with the outside world. 
  - Like Salinger? 
 - Or Kaczynski. 
  - I need his address. 
 - I won't give you his address. 
  But I'll take you there. 
  It's a two-hour drive. 
  It'll give us a chance to keep talking. 
  (BIRDS CAWING) 
  Quiet drive. 
  What? 
  (BUZZES) 
  AJ: Go away! 
  AJ, it's, um... it's Carson Drew, your former attorney. 
  There was an old transaction     that I was hoping we could discuss. 
  AJ. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Look, he was eccentric and prickly years ago, I can only imagine it's gotten worse, so... 
  (ENTRY CHIME SOUNDS, LOCK CLICKS) 
  ♪♪     AJ. 
  - You're alive. 
 - Sorry to bother you. 
  I would have called, but you don't have a phone. 
  So people don't bother me. 
  Inside. 
  Make it quick. 
  Who's she? 
  - This is my... 
 - I'm Nancy, and I need to know about Mac, Perry, Rita, Javier and Autumn. 
  What happened in     ? 
  If you're asking, you already know. 
  How are they dead and you're not? 
  Nancy, what kind of question is that? 
  You got a portent, didn't you? 
 How'd you survive it? 
  - Please. 
 - You called her, too? 
  My seven days are almost up, and I'm... 
  (WIND HOWLING) 
  They're coming. 
  - Who's coming? 
 And what seven days? 
 - What is that? 
  What do you... what do you keep looking at? 
  I can't help you. 
  You don't want what I have. 
 Fend for yourself. 
  AJ, I need... 
  If you know what's good for you, you're gonna get the hell out right now! 
  - Don't threaten her. 
 - AJ... 
  It's not me threatening her, Drew. 
  - Go! 
 - Please, stop. 
  - Go! 
 Go! 
 - Please! 
 AJ... 
  Nancy, we're leaving. 
 Let's go. 
  (GHOSTLY SHRIEKING) 
  _     HANNAH: Looks like some sort of talisman. 
  Yeah, I got it off of someone - who survived the Aglaeca. 
 - (DOOR CLOSES) 
  You found AJ Nishiyama? 
  AJ Crane, actually. 
  - But what are you doing here? 
 - Whoa, whoa, wait. 
  AJ is AJ Crane. 
 Like,  the  AJ Crane? 
  I've read all of his books. 
 Did you meet him? 
  Yes. 
 Um, so he kept looking at this like it was a security blanket. 
  Is it possible that it could repel the Aglaeca? 
  I could check the archives, but it's probably a long shot. 
  Okay. 
 Thank you. 
  Um, hey... 
  w-what if we just returned Lucy's bones to the Aglaeca? 
  - What? 
 Back into the ocean? 
 No. 
 - Why? 
  It could cancel the curse. 
 I've-I've done research. 
  I have documentation. 
  It could be worth exploring. 
  No, we're not doing it, Bess. 
 It doesn't make sense. 
  Nothing we've done so far makes any sense. 
  Nothing is working,     Nancy, and... 
  everyone wants to try this. 
  When were you all gonna tell me? 
  I'm telling you now. 
  (GROANS) 
  Going to lunch. 
  Joyce is in charge. 
 No parties. 
  Yo, Fred, you... 
  You're not Fred. 
  Where's Fred? 
  The new detective transferred him to traffic duty. 
  Detective Tamura? 
  Why would he do that? 
  I mean, I'd ask the guy, but he went to lunch. 
  Said the evidence room security was lax. 
  Too many civilians in and out. 
  Well, that makes sense. 
  I mean, what, with the human skull that he found. 
  You don't want a lot of people just popping in to say "hello". 
  What human skull? 
  ♪♪     ♪♪     (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  Ooh, Dad. 
 What are you doing here? 
  _     Again? 
 What happened to retirement? 
  You never tell me when you're coming in to work. 
  I'm part of this family, too. 
  Well, tonight I have plans with my friends. 
 Uh... 
 I'll be there. 
  I'll be there. 
 See you tonight at sundown. 
  Okay? 
 All right. 
  Do you have a nice jacket? 
  Landlords like to rent to tenants who wear nice jackets. 
  Yeah, yeah, it's just under my top hat. 
 George. 
  Polo shirt. 
 See, this works. 
  Look, listen, before I go ask for a three-day lease with an option for death... 
  Okay, stop! 
 Just stop. 
  It gets to me, too, all right? 
  Hey, okay. 
 It's okay. 
  Look, I didn't come here to pick out clothing with you. 
  I came because, if we have less than three days left, I don't want to be apart for any of it. 
  Me, neither. 
  It's not fair... you and me. 
  I just... 
 I keep thinking about all the things we're gonna miss, like... 
  (SIGHS) 
 We're never gonna have a road trip, or an anniversary for our first kiss. 
  Or wake up in the same bed, argue over who stole the covers. 
  Or even get to bed in the first place. 
  I don't want to miss everything, Nick. 
  - Mmm. 
 - Mmm. 
  (DOOR CLOSES) 
  Oh, my. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Nancy. 
 I... 
  NICK: Oh, we were, we were just, um, uh, uh... 
  Look, I don't need details. 
  - We're so sorry, Nancy. 
 - Yeah, yeah. 
  - Uh, we're gonna go. 
 We're gonna... 
 - Sorry. 
  We're gonna go. 
  (PHONE RINGING) 
  Hello? 
  AJ: Where's your daughter, Drew? 
  AJ? 
  That girl took something of mine, and now hell is coming for her. 
  AJ, what are you talking about? 
  Hello? 
 AJ!

  (PHONE VIBRATING) 
  Hello? 
  Nancy, it's Hannah. 
  Do you still have that talisman? 
  Yeah, I'm looking right at it. 
  Get rid of it. 
  That pattern... 
  it's the mark of the bhoot. 
  Malevolent spirits on the Indian subcontinent. 
  What does that mean? 
  It doesn't repel spirits. 
  It attracts them. 
  It's bait for the most vicious and dangerous ghosts in the area. 
  Nancy, you need to get... 
  - (LINE CLICKS) 
 - Hannah? 
  Hannah?!

 - Where-Where's my talisman? 
  - (DOOR OPENS) 
 - TAMURA: Police! 
  AJ Crane, put your hands up. 
  What? 
 No. 
 Wait, wait. 
 What are you doing? 
  Your father asked me to check the house. 
  - My father? 
 - You're under arrest for breaking and entering. 
  You have the right to remain silent. 
  - Anything you say... 
 - No! 
 He didn't do anything! 
  I need to talk to him. 
  A Hudson getting his own groceries. 
  What is it, a full moon or something? 
  They're for Patrice Dodd. 
  That's unexpected. 
  You're, uh, getting groceries for Lucy's mom now? 
  Yeah, well, she's all alone, so I started visiting her. 
  I figured it was a... a way to honor Lucy. 
  Is that supposed to make me feel better about being your daughter? 
  I don't know. 
 Does it? 
  (SCOFFS) 
 Forget it. 
 I... 
 need a favor. 
  See, that right there... 
 that's the opposite of unexpected. 
  I know, but think about all the times I didn't ask you for money or braces or dance lessons or keys to the Porsche. 
  Okay, Nancy. 
 What's the favor? 
  I know that Horseshoe Bay P.D. 
 is under new management, but does the Hudson name still have juice there? 
  Hey! 
 I want to see a lawyer! 
  (SIGHS) 
  (EERIE BREATHING ECHOES) 
  (GASPS) 
  (SHRIEKING) 
  Mr.

  (SHUDDERING) 
  (GASPS) 
  - You brought it? 
 - Yeah. 
  I, um... 
  I'm really sorry that I took it. 
  I... 
 I didn't know what else to do. 
  Can you tell me how it works? 
 Please? 
  Yeah, Shabbat. 
 It's a whole thing with my dad. 
  He converted when he married my mom. 
  Bess, don't worry. 
  I will be at the shoreline in time for low tide. 
  I got to go. 
 Bye. 
  Mom come back early? 
  _     Ace. 
  Heard I missed you at the station today. 
  Thanks for welcoming me into your home. 
  - You look surprised. 
 - No. 
  This is... this is my Shabbat face. 
  TAMURA: Ah. 
  How did all this come about? 
  "Ran into Detective Tamura after lunch. 
  Told him about our Shabbat dinner, and he said..." The hardest part about moving to a new town is having no one to celebrate Shabbat with. 
  Well... 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  It's amazing. 
 Uh... 
  The same day that I visited the police station, you got yourself invited to dinner here. 
  It is amazing, no bones about it. 
  _     I didn't know that you were Jewish. 
  - Half-Jewish. 
 - Half-Jewish. 
  _     Here's a thought. 
 Why... 
 Why don't we let our guest say the Motzi? 
  "We don't need to put Abe on the spot like that". 
  Actually, I'm-I'm happy to take a stab at it. 
  See if I can remember all the words. 
   Baruch ata, Adonai Eloheinu,   melech ha'olam,   hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz.  I could sing it, too, if you guys... 
  Oh, that's okay. 
 He can't hear. 
  You look hungry. 
 We should just... 
  go right into it. 
  There were six of us in the car. 
  Six... stupid teenagers. 
  Mac was driving too fast, trying to scare Rita. 
  We skidded through a red light, slammed into a station wagon, and it burst into flame. 
  Did you... 
  God protects idiots. 
  The other driver and... 
 (SHUDDERS) 
  his wife were both killed. 
  They pulled a three-year-old girl out of the wreckage. 
  She wasn't expected to survive the night. 
  It was our fault. 
  We had to do something. 
  So you called to the Aglaeca. 
  We asked to make sure the little girl lived. 
  Mm. 
 We couldn't pay the toll. 
  Yeah, just like us. 
  The little girl... 
  After she got out of the burn unit, she was adopted by a couple that ran the historical society. 
  Oh, my God. 
  The scars on her arms are burns. 
  The-the little girl was Hannah Gruen? 
  The Aglaeca always keeps her end of the bargain. 
  Seven days later, my five friends were dead. 
  But you're not. 
  How is that? 
 How'd you do it? 
  My friends stayed put. 
 I hit the road. 
  But you can't outrun the Aglaeca. 
  She'll find you, wherever you are. 
  So... 
  ... I started looking for anything that would keep a monster at bay. 
  And I found it, in a pawn shop in New Orleans. 
  It's like a magnet. 
  It draws the most malevolent spirits around to you, so the Aglaeca stays away. 
  How do you keep a man-eating tiger out of your tent? 
  Make sure to keep yourself covered with the most poisonous spiders you can find. 
  (SHUDDERS) 
  And if you're an orphan and your will to survive far outweighs everything else, you endure the pain. 
  They come in waves. 
  Every single day for    years. 
  And there's no other way out? 
  I've looked. 
  If there's another way out, I haven't found it. 
  (WIND WHISTLING) 
  They're coming. 
  - You should go. 
 - Wait. 
  Um, my-my friend Bess, she-she came up with this theory. 
  W-What if we give back what we asked the Aglaeca for? 
  I asked for a little girl to live. 
  That option isn't available to me anymore. 
  Y-Yeah, but-but... but what about us? 
  Try anything. 
 Just don't end up like me. 
  - Now go. 
 - Are you gonna be all right? 
  Get the hell out! 
  - (WIND SCREECHING) 
 - Go! 
 Go! 
  (NANCY PANTING) 
  Bess? 
 I'm in. 
  Let's give that bitch the bones back. 
  - Oh. 
 Uh...

  Um, this is all they had. 
  (LAUGHS SOFTLY) 
  I mean, I-I wanted it to have a view. 
  Or, um, or, um...

  You found a human bone at The Claw?

  I don't know how that happened. 
  BESS: Wait, I do. 
  I do. 
  Okay, so in one of his books, The Cold Cell, the guy spends three years researching the company who manufactures the prison's bars, doors and hinges. 
  It's in the hinges. 
  Check the hinges! 
  We just had a sighting on Chestnut Street. 
  - He's headed east. 
 - Set up a roadblock. 
 Then... 
  check the hinges. 
  You and your friends, we're gonna have a real come-to-Jesus when this is over.

  AJ was spotted on Chestnut Street. 
  Hey, that's the historical society. 
  Yeah, what if we're not the only ones trying to return something to the Aglaeca tonight? 
  Well, what did AJ ask for? 
  Hannah Gruen's life.

  AJ, stop. 
  Is this the plan? 
  Hannah dies in a car fire, like she was supposed to, you give her back to the Aglaeca? 
  For    years I let the worst kind of monsters destroy me every single day. 
 I'm through. 
  You think that this ends your suffering? 
  Because it doesn't. 
 I-I think it'll be worse. 
  You can't avoid the monster when it's you. 
  You are not a monster. 
  You are a survivor. 
  So give me the matches. 
  Give me the matches. 
  - Nancy!

  NANCY: Let him go. 
  Is that his? 
  NANCY: AJ, wait. 
 Hey. 
  You're not gonna get very far. 
  AJ: I left it for you. 
  The Aglaeca's out there waiting. 
 You're unprotected. 
  Turns out I was never protected. 
  All those years alone with your demons,     it's... 
 it's just another way of being dead. 
  The Aglaeca can have whatever's left of me. 
  NICK: What are we doing here? 
  Yeah, are any of us gonna wish that we spent one more night at work? 
  We're celebrating. 
  What, you think the curse reverse worked? 
  Called off the Aglaeca? 
  I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe not. 
  But what I do know is that no matter what happens tomorrow or the next day, the five of us were here today. 
  Yeah, we are. 
  Desserts all around. 
  Yeah, I like that. 
 And for the record, yes, I do think the curse has been reversed. 
  (BELL JINGLES) 
  BESS: Oh, no. 
  It's Lucy's bones. 
  No return policy. 
  I hate this store. 
  Hey, um... 
  I'm sorry I steamrolled you into using your mother's remains as some kind of offering. 
  That's okay. 
 At least we got 'em back. 
  - (PHONE CHIMES) 
 - And we're not giving up,     - there's... 
 - ACE: Hey, guys, check your phones. 
  National News Alert. 
  "Renowned horror author dies in freak accident". 
  - Oh, my God. 
 - "Writer AJ Crane was killed Friday when an errant weather vane fell from a rooftop and impaled him in front of horrified residents". 
  "Grieving fans are claiming he predicted his own death in his recent best seller..."  "He Died Alone".  BESS: Hey, I-I've read that one. 
  Yeah, it's... it's the scariest book he's ever written. 
  Two more nights. 
  That's it. 
  Don't think about it. 
  I'll walk you home. 
  Nick... 
  let's get in the truck. 
  (SCOFFS) 
 No. 
  The day after tomorrow, we die in that truck. 
  Okay, and you know what? 
 I don't care anymore. 
  We're still here, and the Aglaeca doesn't get to ruin everything. 
  I'm tired of being afraid. 
  We're reclaiming your truck. 
  Get in.

  That's a baller move. 
  Walk away. 
  GEORGE: Well, you were right. 
 This place is beyond creepy. 
  And in the middle of nowhere. 
  Which is why we buried the talisman here. 
  But before we go... 
  Great. 
  (DOOR CREAKING) 
  AJ spent decades of his life trying to figure out how to beat the Aglaeca, and all of his notes are here. 
  Yeah, it's like being inside the brain of a crazy man. 
  Here is something. 
  Hey, what is that? 
  I think he was trying to build a dybbuk box. 
  Um, follow-up question: what is a dybbuk box? 
  Uh, in Jewish folklore, the dybbuk's an evil spirit. 
  Just like the Aglaeca. 
 And you use this to trap it. 
  And it looks like he never finished it. 
  So he never got the chance to try it. 
  So there we go. 
 We-we finish the box, and we trap the Aglaeca. 
  Best plan I've heard since the last plan I heard. 
  (WIND HOWLING) 
  Hey, guys, what was that? 
  - The wind? 
 - They're coming. 
  The talisman drew the spirits back. 
  All right, people, grab whatever you can. 
  We are vacating the premises. 
  (GHOSTLY SHRIEKING) 
  Ace. 
  You got that over there? 
  - Come on, let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 - Come on, guys.
