 So, we wounded the Aglaeca. 
 With sand from our portent. 
 How did the sand turn into the seaweed wreath? 
 I bet it was because I was the last one who touched it, and the wreath was my portent. 
 The point is, we found the Aglaeca's kryptonite. 
 'Cause each of the portents represented parts of her death: the seaweed that choked her, the water that drowned her. 
 What if we use more of the sand to finish her off before she kills us? 
 We're all out of sand. 
 We lost it all when she exploded the dybbuk box. 
 (EXHALES) 
 The sun's about to rise. 
 We officially have one more day before our death visions come true. 
 No. 
 I know where to find more sand. 
 Meet here in two hours. 
 We'll divvy up the new batch and put an end to the Aglaeca. 
 Well, how do we lure her into the open? 
 (EXHALES) 
 We use ourselves as bait. 
 ♪♪    ♪♪     What? 
 You're kidding. 
 I put the seaweed wreath in here. 
 There should be sand in here. 
 BESS: No, I, uh... 
 I feng shui'd the space. 
 You what? 
 (EXHALES) 
 Oh, I threw it out. 
 Nancy... 
 (STAMMERS) 
 Wait. 
 Hold on. 
 How-how was I supposed to know we were gonna need it? 
 - (STAMMERS) 
 - No, it's fine. 
 - No. 
 Listen. 
 - No, it's okay. 
 - My chi felt so balanced afterward. 
 - It's okay. 
 _    (SCOFFS) 
 You kidding me? 
 Of course. 
 The one time a year Mom decides to vacuum. 
 What are you looking for? 
 A lifeline. 
 Okay, breakfast time, guys. 
 Get your foot. 
 Jesse, did you... 
 cook? 
 Yeah. 
 It's probably not very good though. 
 (EXHALES) 
 'Kay, one of those is for George, okay? 
 - Give it to me. 
 Give it to me. 
 - But I'm... 
 - 'Kay, everybody gets one, guys! 
 Stop! 
 - Charlie, that's mine! 
 Don't make George be the octopus! 
 Sorry. 
 What do you mean by "octopus"? 
 An octopus cares for its eggs for    months, and then once... 
 And then nothing. 
 It's good and it's happy. 
 Jesse has a vision, and we're gonna make it happen. 
 Right, guys? 
 You know, I actually don't even remember the last time we had breakfast together. 
 This... is awesome. 
 (SNORTS, CHUCKLES) 
 What is wrong with you? 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 - Does having a boyfriend make you mushy? 
 Okay, guys, the toast is getting cold. 
 Okay, just shut up and eat your food. 
 The bus is almost here. 
 Oh. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Breakfast selfie? 
 - Please? 
 Take a picture. 
 - Okay. 
 Come on! 
 Everybody get close. 
 - 'Kay, we better eat these. 
 - (GIGGLES) 
 - It would mean so much. 
 - Quickly. 
 - Come on, come on, come on. 
 - Mm. 
 (CAMERA CLICKS) 
 - (GIGGLES) 
 - (WHISPERS): Thank you. 
 - Here. 
 You happy? 
 - Yeah. 
 Can I, uh, get another battery, please? 
 Ace. 
 Can-can you stop playing with your phone for a second? 
 I'm looking at AJ Crane's death photo on a  chan chat board. 
 Eyewitness got a photo right after the weathervane impaled him. 
 There's a bunch of comments about what this shadow is    in the woods behind his body. 
 Whoa. 
 ACE: Looks like the Aglaeca comes to personally claim her victims. 
 Think she can be in four places at once? 
 Not... 
 not likely. 
 So then she comes for you one by one? 
 I'd been picturing, like, a... 
 totally simultaneous  Godfather -style group event. 
 And that means we got five shots to take her out. 
 And one of us is gonna be first. 
 Hope we found enough portent sand to split five ways. 
 _     We have no sand. 
 I checked my house, the office, the cooler. 
 And our kitchen has weirdly never been so clean. 
 Yeah, there's nothing in my truck either. 
 NANCY: What about the Marvin mansion? 
 ACE: No dice. 
 Unfortunately, someone hired a cleanup crew the day after Owen died. 
 Hmm. 
 Seems like someone let a cleaning fairy on the loose. 
 Okay, I'm sorry. 
 It was me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I-I was just trying to balance our chi, you know? 
 - And I was just trying to help. 
 - You know how you can help? 
 Stop wallowing in self-pity. 
 Self-pity? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 At least I'm not St. 
 George, the martyr. 
 You know, you're always talking about your family like it's  such  a burden, when the rest of us would kill   
 - to have something like that! 
 - O-Okay, okay. 
 - You don't have to snap at her. 
 - ACE: That was a re-snap. 
 You can't snap a re-snap. 
 George snapped first. 
 Okay, guys, stop. 
 We cannot fall apart right now. 
 Nobody's falling apart. 
 I'm just being transparent. 
 GEORGE: Says the guy who spied on us for the cops. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Wait, wait, why did you have to work for McGinnis again? 
 Ace had to stay out of jail because he hacked into a federal database! 
 Although you never did tell me why you did that. 
 He doesn't owe us an explanation, so just drop it. 
 Oh. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Of course she would say that. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It means you think silence is healthy. 
 It means you operate on a need-to-know basis. 
 - I operate? 
 - Yeah, yeah. 
 As opposed to interact authentically with other people as equals and not use us as-as tools in your missions and distractions for your pain. 
 Nick, my mom had just died. 
 Wait, what are we talking about now? 
 - This is irrelevant! 
 - ACE: This summer, when Nancy used Nick as a means to deal with her grief. 
 Ouch. 
 Why are we wasting time on this right now? 
 Oh, very on-brand, Drew. 
 Using our crappy odds as an excuse not to wrap up your loose ends. 
 Okay, just because I refuse to be fatalistic    
 - does not mean... 
 - Fatalistic? 
 You haven't had a blood bucket curse     
 - hanging over your head for months. 
 - No! 
 No! 
 I haven't. 
 I'm just trying to actually save you    
 - from dying. 
 - (SCOFFS): Yeah. 
 - Oh. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 - BESS: Save her? 
 Okay, this is your fault to begin with, Nancy. 
 I mean, look at us. 
 Correct me if I'm wrong... 
 (SIGHS) 
 Cause... 
 and effect. 
 Look at us. 
 The one moment we're all supposed to be working together, this is what we do. 
 If I caused the curse, I will avert it, too. 
 I will find a way to save us all. 
 Today.

 (CAR DOOR OPENS) 
 RYAN: Man, we should've brought binoculars. 
 CARSON: I know we're worried about Nancy, but binoculars would cross a line, obviously. 
 Is that obvious? 
 I wouldn't know. 
 My dad used to pay P.I.s to tail me. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. 
 Wanted to know how many secrets I had. 
 How do you even know that? 
 'Cause one of his P.I.s. reached out to me personally. 
 So... we came up with a number that felt right, and I started paying him to give Everett misinformation. 
 I think Dad caught on pretty quick, but I think he respected my initiative. 
 It was kind of like our... 
 father-son bonding activity, you know? 
 I have some parenting books I can recommend to you. 
 Flattered you think I could learn. 
 Why not? 
 You have a chance to reinvent yourself now. 
 - Right? 
 - Yeah. 
 Once they set a date for Everett's trial... 
 Oh, God. 
 If they set a date. 
 Everett's already out on a million dollars' bail, and he's got every person whispering in the governor's ear. 
 And you're not gonna stand up to your father? 
 I've thought about it. 
 Even if I had a bulletproof way to take down Everett, then what? 
 Uh, ruin our family's fortune? 
 Then what do  I  do? 
 (CHUCKLES): Work at a coffee shop? 
 NANCY:  I need sand.   
 We do live in a beach town. 
 A-Aglaeca sand. 
 I know that we've gone through everything that you could possibly ever have that's Aglaeca-related, but... others have called to her in the past and gone to the Keeper for help. 
 There is a chance that one of them put their portent sand in one of those lockboxes. 
 If you could check, I-I really, really need some. 
 Well, there's nothing that matches that description in the lockboxes from my time. 
 But there are several hundred years of haunted objects stored in the archives. 
 Yeah. 
 I will check for anything remotely sand-related. 
 Wait here. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 ♪♪     "Haunted mirror from Chesapeake Bay. 
 Smelted Babylonian demon bowl. 
 Shroud used to revive the dead at Antietam. 
 Cursed Victorian bridal gown. 
 Navajo..." That ledger is for the Keeper's eyes only. 
 Is this real? 
 All of this stuff? 
 'Cause I could really use some of it. 
 Against the Aglaeca? 
 No. 
 And I just checked. 
 The only archive item that even mentions sand is a cursed effigy made of sandpiper bones. 
 Okay, what about the demon bowl? 
 Or the-the spirit traps? 
 - (STAMMERS) 
 - Nancy, there is a reason these boxes have stayed sealed - for hundreds of years. 
 - I know... 
 No. 
 You can't use a chunk of uranium to cure cancer.

 These items are too dangerous. 
 They'll do more harm than good.

 Ryan, why is your car so clean? 
 Uh, because I vacuum it every day. 
 Okay, where's your vacuum? 
 In the trunk. 
 What-what is going on? 
 - You keep a vacuum in your trunk? 
 - That's not weird. 
 - That's not weird, right? 
 - I keep a DustBuster in my car, just in case. 
 (TRUNK BEEPING) 
 - See? 
 - Oh. 
 And it's a good thing I had it, too, because that time we took that side trip to Trenton, you got my car all dirty. 
 I had to clean up all the sand. 
 Uh, sorry.

 ACE: All good. 
 Just wanted some company while we're contemplating shuffling off our mortal coils. 
 BESS: Does anyone besides Nancy have any loose ends they want to tie up? 
 What kind of loose ends? 
 I don't know... 
 Regrets, ruminations, deathbed confessions. 
 I confess... 
 that I hacked into a federal database to get the phone number of somebody in witness protection. 
 BESS: You did? 
 Who? 
 Bess, it's called witness protection. 
 - BESS: Okay. 
 - Person's still protected. 
 I never called the number. 
 I wasn't brave enough. 
 BESS: Hey, no judgment     as your platanchor. 
 But I-I do owe you an apology. 
 I borrowed your pocketknife without asking. 
 You took Madeline? 
 And I took George's skull bracelet. 
 - Yeah, I knew that. 
 - And your key fob, Nick. 
 I didn't take any of the keys. 
 It was just the shiny bit. 
 I have a problem. 
 I steal things when I feel bad. 
 And if we do live, I am gonna try and stop doing that. 
 ACE: Stop feeling bad or stealing? 
 Both. 
 NICK: Hey, here's my confession. 
 I haven't done the one thing that Tiffany wanted me to do. 
 Use her USB drive to take down the Hudsons. 
 And the truth is, I didn't want to put myself out there like some... 
 some sacrificial lamb. 
 I just... 
 I just wanted to rebuild my life. 
 And... and co-own a restaurant, and... 
 and be in love. 
 ACE: Nick, for what it's worth, I've skimmed the surface of that drive. 
 It's not something you could do by yourself. 
 Too many holes in the information. 
 You need somebody on the inside to fill in the blanks before you could even think about taking down the Hudson empire. 
 Oh, I also need Nancy's permission, now that she's technically a Hudson. 
 (CHUCKLES): Oh, well, permission granted, if it helps. 
 George... 
 what about you? 
 No regrets. 
 Nancy's turn. 
 Well... 
 I regret ever hurting any of you. 
 You trusted me when I made mistakes. 
 And I never wanted anybody to get hurt. 
 Even though I am a Hudson, and my genes don't exactly do me any favors in the leadership department. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Nancy, I believe you. 
 Okay? 
 Don't worry.

 There's a lot you never knew about her, including her ability to put puzzles together. 
 
 
 
 But this was one she never got to finish. 
 She wanted to bring your father to justice. 
 Now, the files alone aren't enough to convict him.

 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 We were wrong before. 
 I was wrong. 
 The sand from the portents, it represents the trauma that Odette experienced in her death. 
 By using it against her, it only reminded Odette why she became the Aglaeca in the first place. 
 It only made her angrier and stronger. 
 So, that's it, then. 
 The Aglaeca can't be destroyed. 
 Not with violence. 
 But we can appeal to the human the monster once was. 
 There-there has to be a piece of Odette left inside the Aglaeca. 
 If we can tap into that and remind her who she used to be, I think that could be enough. 
 I think that could be enough to keep her from killing us. 
 So, it's the Aglaeca that wants us dead, not Odette. 
 So, are you in? 
 Odette became the Aglaeca because she died in a state of fear, rage and suffering. 
 So, all we have to do is remind her who she was. 
 These letters, she wrote them on her voyage across the Atlantic. 
 They're to an Englishwoman that she loved. 
 So, Lonesome Ghost Agnes must have found these in Odette's possessions before they locked her in a cellar? 
 "Sharay Marie, ill fight tropp froyd sans toy". 
 It's French. 
 "Chère  Marie, uh, it is..."    
 NICK: "Too cold without you". 
 Count of Monte Cristo  fan. 
 Alexandre Dumas. 
 He wrote in French. 
 So, that's your big play, Drew? 
 You suddenly realize that love is the most human thing that humans can ever human, and now we're reading letters to a ghost? 
 Love is fundamental. 
 And desperate. 
 And the one weapon we haven't tried. 
 Odette  and the Englishwoman met in London. 
 They were really into stargazing. 
 Odette made the voyage to come build a life for them. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Even though the ocean scared her. 
 I think the letters in English make that clear. 
 But the Englishwoman loved the sea, especially the beach.
