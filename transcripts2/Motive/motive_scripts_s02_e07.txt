 Woman : That is my son underneath there! 
 Please! Finn! 
 Finn! Let me see him! 
 Hey. 
 I got my whole team here, but I wanted to come see you first. 
 Is that okay? 
 Uh-huh. 
 My name's Stuart. 
 Your mom said your name's Finn. Is that right? 
 Is my mom here? 
 Yes, she is, she seems like a real nice lady. 
 Is she mad about my bike? 
 No. She said it was time to get a new one anyway. 
 Can you do this for me, Finn... 
 Can you take my hand? 
 Alright. 
 Okay. I gotcha. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 I promise. 
 Just hold on. 
 So, try to relax. Remember what we went over. 
 Don't forget to have fun.

 [Radios crackling] 
 Can you get my boots? 
 Got 'em. 
 Thank you. 
 You do know what this says about us, don't you? 
 Yeah, that we'd rather be at a crime scene than a wedding reception. 
 Vega, laughing : That's exactly what it says! 
 You were the best man, too. 
 I know. I'm not worried about him. 
 My father will get married again soon, I'm sure. 
 I did like their vows, though. 
 They were nice. Simple. 
 Yeah. Well. Honesty, loyalty, friendship. 
 The basis of any good partnership, right? 
 Yeah. The good ones. 
 Did they like the gift? 
 Vega : We don't know. What do we have? 
 The victim is 41. 
 Graeme Jenkins. First-time skydiver. 
 Don't these things come with reserve chutes? 
 They do, and Mr. Jenkins pulled his, but it malfunctioned. 
 What are the odds of that? 
 Um, Officer Sung? 
 Why don't you tell Detectives Flynn and Vega what you've found? 
 Yes, Detective Lucas. 
 Uh, so it appears that his parachute cords snapped. 
 That can happen? 
 No. Current fiber technology? 
 It's actually virtually impossible. 
 So they cut it to make it look like an accident? 
 Yes, that's more likely. 
 Could he cut his own chute? 
 We don't know yet. 
 As in suicide? 
 Anything's possible. 
 Vega : Yeah, but there are probably easier ways to kill yourself. 
 That seems like a lot of effort. 
 Thank you, Officer Sung. Appreciate it. 
 I think it's safe to say we all noticed. 
 I think they're adorable. 
 Detectives... 
 Please tell me that this gentleman had a heart attack before he hit the ground. 
 I can't tell you that yet. 
 What can you tell us, Doctor? 
 That I'm a woman who's seen a lot of things, and this still tops my "Worst Fears" list. 
 Which is probably true for most people, right? 
 10,000 feet does a lot of damage to our bodies. 
 That's a hell of a way to die. 
 Flynn : [Sighs] 
 ♪ 
 [Knocking] 
 Can I help you? 
 Oh... 
 I'm with the police. 
 What's happened? 
 There's been an accident. 
 Lee : Well, it's a six-hour course. 
 We teach them to pack their chutes and then we do some jump training on the big mats. 
 After lunch, we do in-air positions. 
 And that's it? Just like that? 
 After six hours, they can jump? 
 I've never had a problem before. 
 Could he have done this to himself? 
 No, they're individually supervised when they pack their chutes, so I would have noticed something like that. 
 What about the packs? 
 Are they left unattended at any time? 
 No. Not really. 
 At lunch, I guess. 
 And how long is lunch? Like half an hour? 
 If someone was to cut the cord on his parachute and then deactivate his reserve, they'd have to unpack and repack. 
 That'd take over an hour. 
 Graeme was never gone that long. 
 Randy : Two weeks off and you don't have a tan? 
 Stuart, welcome back. 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 Let me guess. 
 Your whole perspective on life has changed and now you're at one with nature? 
 Yeah. Something like that. 
 Cool. 
 What're you doing? 
 They switched my shift. 
 They moved all of us around a couple weeks ago when you were gone. 
 Doug didn't tell you? 
 No. 
 No. But hey, that's cool. 
 Yeah. 
 Ally's awesome, though. 
 You're gonna love working with her. 
 Ally. 
 You don't mind driving? 
 Randy said you prefer shotgun. 
 That's right. 
 He also said you have a bad sense of humor, terrible table manners, and the body odor of an old man who eats nothing but garlic. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. 
 Yeah. Randy is a dork. Nice to meet you too.

 The other three jumpers all said the same thing, that Graeme Jenkins was a quiet guy, seemed excited, scared, just like the rest of them. 
 Okay, well, thanks for that. 
 Oh, Jenkins also said that his parachute was his lucky number. 
 What's his lucky number? 
 15. 
 Well, not so lucky, then. 
 My father started this place 30 years ago, but if the family sues, that could be the end of it. 
 Let's just focus on the victim for now. 
 Of course. 
 Did you see anyone suspicious, someone hanging around that maybe shouldn't be here? 
 There are always people that show up to watch their friends and family jump. 
 Flynn : Anyone like that here today? 
 Well, there was a man standing by the back door just after lunch. 
 Can you describe him? 
 Oh... 
 I don't know, it was from a distance. 
 Average? 
 Tall, white, middle-aged. 
 Vega : What made you notice him? 
 Well, he didn't seem to be with anyone, and he didn't come inside, which is weird. 
 Vega : Great. Thank you. 
 That's... That's helpful. Appreciate it. 
 You think the guy she saw's involved? 
 Well, if Graeme Jenkins didn't do it himself, it's possible, yeah, but it's a vague description to go on. 
 Yeah. "White, middle-aged, tall." 
 Exactly! That could be me. 
 [Scoffs] You're not tall. 
 What? I'm your partner! 
 You're gonna get the truth from me. 
 Well, I'm glad. 
 I hate this car. How about that truth for ya?

 Randy... 
 Seriously? 
 Sorry. 
 It's important if any of these symptoms arise, that you...? 
 Speak up. 
 Because working with PTSD makes you unpredictable, and that makes you...? Stuart? 
 Dangerous.

 That's right!

 What? You never seen a guy in a tuxedo before? 
 Uh, thank you. 
 Uh, I'm gonna go talk to Betty. 
 Okay. I'm grabbing a coffee. 
 You want one? 
 No, thanks. 
 You look nice! 
 Thank you. 
 So it was the impact that killed him? 
 Yes... 
 But more interestingly, he had high levels of opioids in his body. 
 Huh. So our vic was a recreational drug user? 
 Nope. He had cancer. 
 Lung. Three months to live, max. 
 Well, along with other typical cancer drugs, he was also on lorazepam for anxiety and a garden variety of anti-depressants. 
 Well, I'm guessing that's fairly typical for someone with a fatal disease? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Do you think the killer knew he was terminal? 
 Maybe. 
 But if he's gonna die anyway, then why kill him? 
 Or why kill yourself? 
 We've been, uh, preparing for this since Graeme's diagnosis. 
 Uh, a little over a year ago, he was in a really bad car accident. 
 He managed to walk away with just a few scratches, but the EMS crew made him get a chest X-ray because of the airbag and that's when they saw the tumors. 
 "A cluster," they called it. 
 Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your husband? 
 No. He was a good man. 
 A kind man. 
 So he wasn't thinking of suicide? 
 Graeme wouldn't do that. 
 And financially? 
 Did you two make all the arrangements? 
 Yeah, I can get you everything. 
 Our life insurance policy covered us no matter what happened. 
 Was skydiving a typical activity for Graeme? 
 [Sad chuckle] No. Uh... 
 He... made sort of a bucket-list. 
 Numbered everything, and... was meticulously crossing it off. 
 "Visit the Great Wall of China. 
 Camp the Grand Canyon. Swim with dolphins." 
 Mm. He sounds like a very thoughtful man. 
 I couldn't do all of them with him, but he would always call me right before, just to say that he loved me and our daughters. 
 So you spoke with him this afternoon? 
 [Sobs] I didn't know that it would be for the last time. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I already explained this to the officer who came and notified me. 
 Another officer has been here already? 
 Yeah.

 Is that about Graeme Jenkins? 
 No. It's on me and Cross.

 Okay, but you know, if I wanted to read it, I could've requested it myself. 
 Yeah, well, I want you to understand what happened, and I want you to know that I'm still an open book. 
 Okay. Well, then I will look forward to reading it. 
 As far as I can tell, Graeme Jenkins isn't connected to any of the people that were on the plane with him. 
 Well, that doesn't mean they don't have motive to kill him. 
 I thought it was a possible suicide? 
 It's looking less likely, sir. 
 Yeah, the owner of the drop zone said she saw someone hanging around the skydive school. 
 Could be the same person who notified Graeme Jenkins' wife. 
 Alright, so what kind of killer goes out of his way to notify the family? 
 That is what we're trying to find out, sir. 
 Didn't you say that Graeme Jenkins' parachute was his lucky number? 
 That's right, number 15. 
 Flynn : Look at that. 
 The skydiving company report a missing chute? 
 Lucas : No. 
 Zero four. Huh. 
 Lemme. So they switched out the parachute? 
 How would he even know how to do that? 
 Well, if your killer knew the skydiving school's patterns, procedures, maybe an employee? 
 Or another jumper.

 Whatcha got? 
 The owner of the skydiving school said that the last time parachute four was used was Wednesday of this week. 
 Well, that's promising. 
 Yeah, and there were six registered jumpers in Wednesday's class. 
 Okay, so the killer could have taken a class on Wednesday and gotten to know the day's routine, then stole parachute four then. 
 Yeah. And he frays the cords on both chutes... 
 Repacks it. 
 Repacks it, then, uh... 
 Trades it out for Graeme's chute, number 15. 
 Yeah, so who was assigned chute number four on Wednesday? 
 John Turner. 
 Flynn : Turner? 
 Same name as the cop who notified Graeme's wife. 
 And listen to this. 
 All of his contact information came back as dead-ends. 
 Mm. Well, John Turner can't be his real name. 
 No, but that's our guy.

 Yeah, I remember John.

 Uh, yeah, late-40s, blond-ish hair, maybe six feet, normal-looking.

 We have. 
 Should I be worried? 
 No. There's nothing in there that can hurt us, right?

 You steal something? 
 Use your words, son. 
 He had a bottle of scotch. 
 How'd you know it was in there? 
 I saw him drink some before he went up in the plane. 
 What'd you do with it? 
 I threw it out when the police showed up. 
 Why? 
 Didn't taste good. 
 Plus, it knocked me on my ass. 
 Well, that's scotch. Isn't that the point? 
 No, not like this. 
 Really screwed me up. 
 Okay, so Graeme has some liquid courage, then he gets on the plane. That tracks. 
 There was a bottle of scotch on Graeme's bucket-list. 
 Was there? 
 Yeah, Creemore single malt.

 Didn't his wife say that he was working through the list in order?

 He wanted it to be the last thing on his list because it was the last drink he had with his father before he passed away. 
 And he wouldn't have skipped ahead on his list, would he? 
 No, he was, uh, very particular about how he did things. 
 Mm. You're sure he didn't buy it already? 
 No.

 Not that I know of. 
 Vega : Yeah. I look forward to it. Okay. 
 [Hangs phone up] 
 So the wife didn't know about it? 
 Nope. 
 But he could've bought it on the way to the skydiving center, I guess. 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Would he do that and not tell his wife? 
 Hmm. Did Lucas find the bottle that Max threw out? 
 He did. 
 'Cause I've been thinking. 
 Max said that it really screwed him up and knocked him on his ass, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I wanna know if there's something in it that gave it that extra kick. 
 You mean besides the alcohol? 
 Yeah. 
 So I don't get it. 
 If the scotch was laced, why didn't it show up in the autopsy? 
 It did. 
 Come again? 
 Well, the lab didn't flag it because he was already taking lorazepam. 
 Well, if he was already taking lorazepam, he wouldn't have to hide it with the scotch. 
 That rules out suicide. 
 He might not have had a heart attack, but his anxiety levels would've been very low. 
 Lorazepam is prescribed for panic attacks. 
 So Graeme's final moments might not have been that terrifying? 
 What a relief, huh? 
 Well, it means I might have a compassionate killer on my hands. 
 A compassionate killer? 
 Yeah. They do exist, you know. 
 Yeah. Well, except to say that compassionate killers don't cut the cords on their victims' parachutes. 
 Listen, if your victim's high as a kite, you can do whatever you want to him. 
 OK. I'll tell you what I think. 
 We, uh, track the scotch, we find our killer. 
 What, you think the scotch-maker has an exact record of where they sold it? 
 I do. Because this particular scotch costs $150, not $50, a bottle, and it's sold in select smaller batches, directly from the distillery. 
 Hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 So, do you want me to start looking through the DMV photos for this guy? 
 I don't mind, even if it does take... weeks. 
 That skydiver said that John Turner rode a motorcycle, didn't he? 
 That's right.

 Gotta be.

 Yeah. So what made him a killer? 
 OK. So the skydiving instructor confirms from the photo that Stuart Fletcher is, in fact, one John Turner who took the class last Wednesday and chickened out before the jump. 
 And that's when you think he stole the parachute. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, he's a paramedic with access to lorazepam, which is the drug we found in Graeme's scotch. 
 Well, lots of people have access to lorazepam. 
 Yeah, but he just came off medical leave and even though his boss wasn't at liberty to share the details without a warrant, I'm guessing PTSD.

 Well, does the name Graeme Jenkins sound familiar to you? 
 No. It doesn't. 
 You're sure you never heard him mention him? 
 We think he might've been involved in a traffic accident that Stuart attended. 
 Ohh... there was one call. 
 He might've been involved. 
 Well, what happened? 
 A little kid got hit by a car, riding his bike. 
 He ended up with permanent brain damage. 
 It was sad and Stuart took it really, really hard. 
 He took it hard because it was a kid involved? 
 Stuart blamed himself. 
 He misdiagnosed internal bleeding, and the boy sleeped into a coma. 
 Stu needed to take some time off to get some perspective, so he took a week-long hiking trip. 
 I thought he'd got a handle on it, but... 
 Do you know the name of the driver who caused the accident? 
 Some woman. She was texting. 
 That hiking trip, do you know where he went? 
 Westcoast trail. 
 Okay. Thank you very much. 
 Thank you. 
 So it's not about revenge. 
 No, it wasn't, but he did hike the west coast trail. 
 That was on Graeme's bucket-list, too, wasn't it? 
 Yeah, and if they did it at the same time, that could be our connection. 
 I hope so. 
 ♪ 
 Stuart Fletcher? 
 Detectives Flynn and Vega. 
 We're investigating the murder of Graeme Jenkins. 
 Okay. Am I supposed to know who that is? 
 Well, we have witnesses who put you at the edge skydiving school last Wednesday. 
 Does that sound right? 
 Uh, yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. 
 Didn't go through with it? 
 I guess I'm not as tough as I look. 
 But you finished the westcoast trail. 
 That's pretty tough. 
 That's right. 
 We think you met Graeme Jenkins there. 
 That, uh, trail is 75 kilometers long. 
 You... You meet a lot of people. Doesn't ring a bell. 
 Can I go? 
 Don't plan any camping trips any time soon. 
 Well, that's our "John Turner." 
 Should we bring him in? 
 We want him for murder, not impersonating a police officer. 
 Lucas : Graeme and Stuart's dates do overlap. 
 Graeme came home with a sprained ankle. 
 Didn't give her any details, but said that another hiker came to his rescue. 
 Oh, that could be the work of an off-duty paramedic. 
 She also said that, weeks leading up to his trip, that he seemed stressed, and he was recently talking about selling their house. 
 She just assumed that it was "The Cancer Blues." 
 Why would he want to sell their house? 
 She didn't know, but when he came back, he didn't bring it up again. 
 Okay, so he knew something she didn't. 
 And what do most people stress about? 
 Money. 
 Answering machine : Hi. You've reached Jennifer. 
 Leave me a message. Stuart : Hey. It's me. I've made a lot of mistakes, so... I understand why you're not here. [Gulps and sighs] I just want you to know I don't blame you. This is on me. I've always loved you. I always will. See here? Their insurance policy included full coverage. Right. So no matter what happened to Graeme, his family was taken care of. Yeah, and all the documents that Ingrid sent us were legit, but it turns out that the insurance company sent Graeme a new notification just over a month ago. Well, they found out Graeme lied about being a smoker. They called it pre-existing condition. So if he dies of lung cancer, his family gets nothing? That's what Graeme knew that Ingrid didn't. That's a big problem. Yeah, and Stuart was the solution. [Knocking] Come in. You know, we're pretty confident you did know Graeme Jenkins, Stuart. You are? That's right.
