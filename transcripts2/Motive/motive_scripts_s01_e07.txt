 Greetings! 
 Yeah, it was a lovely morning, until now. 
 What do we have? 
 A bit of a mess, I'm afraid. 
 Shop owner's name is Hank Cousineau. 
 Opened up every day like clockwork, except for the past week, it's been a little more sporadic. 
 So he broke his pattern. I wonder why. 
 Well, so did the neighboring shopkeepers. 
 When they noticed that he didn't bring in today's paper, one of them called it in. 
 Said Cousineau was cantankerous. 
 A curmudgeon. 
 Well, somebody agreed in a big way. 
 Hey, Betts. 
 Good weekend? 
 Uh, long story short... 
 Tears. Not mine. 
 In the meantime... 
 Nice to see you too, Oscar. 
 Okay. Laceration to the artery. No weapon found. 
 Impact point of spatter starts here.

 Sitting. 
 For a while. 
 Substantial blood loss onto his chest before falling forward. 
 Then he bled out onto the floor. 
 Self-inflicted? 
 No. Slice is too clean. 
 No signs of struggle or binding. 
 Maybe he was drugged. 
 Well, you gotta give a girl a chance to do her job. 
 Okay, so... 
 What we know now is, a kill like this... 
 You maintain eye-contact. 
 To do that, that's control. 
 Whoever killed him wanted to watch him die.

 Gazebo, huh?

 See, Mary would like something that's child-friendly for, you know, down the road.

 Cousineau didn't have a family.

 Maybe the vic has P.T.S.D. 
 Maybe the husband reported him to the police.

 Based on the fact that she was willing to kill to protect her life here. 
 You were right.

 And... 
 I found a puncture wound concealed in the throat-cut. 
 Smart. 
 So, this sukiyaki-choline, what does it do? 
 Paralyzes you in seconds. 
 But the body processes it so quickly, it doesn't show up on a basic-level tox screen. 
 You have to go further, find the metabolites... 
 Which I did. 
 Now, who would have access to a drug like that? 
 It's restricted, used as a muscle-relaxant in tracheotomies.
