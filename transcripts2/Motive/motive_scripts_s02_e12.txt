 How many? 
 Six. 
 League of nations hired six different attorneys. 
 Ah, human trafficking is a lucrative business, right? 
 They want me to come in for a deposition. 
 Oh? - Yes. 
 Know what you're gonna say? 
 I can't talk to you about this. 
 Yeah, you can. 
 No, I can't! 
 Because if they subpoena you, then you've gotta name names. 
 Yeah, that's a good point. I got it. 
 What do you got, Betts? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 Lucas said something about spasms. 
 Sounds like a seizure or stroke to me. 
 Normally, I'd agree with you, except for the discoloration on her cheeks. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Then you know what I'm going to ask next.

 We're this close to signing a deal to turn Lori's books into a TV series. 
 Damn vultures wanted to close on the deal today. 
 How can I help you? 
 We just have a few questions for you. 
 You were Lori's agent? 
 Her manager. Have been for five years. 
 How about this morning? 
 Did you and Lori meet here? 
 No. I picked her up from her house around 9:00 and then we drove here together. 
 Did you guys stop anywhere? 
 No. 
 Did she look ill? 
 She said she had a headache. 
 She thought she might be coming down with something.

 I asked for 5 pages, you gave me 20. 
 A kick-ass 20. 
 That ignored the criteria of the assignment. 
 Come on, you gotta at least give me some points for the murder weapon. 
 Yes, that was a unique kill. 
 But if you have characters that I don't care about, then all that remains is a gimmick. 
 You gotta try a little harder. 
 And try writing something other than crime. 
 I like crime. 
 Well, at least read the real authors of the genre, and not this junk food.

 But this is all she cared about. 
 She didn't know what to do with praise. 
 Huh. How long have you been her assistant, Parker? 
 Three years now. 
 And how had she been lately? 
 Pleased that the new book was getting solid reviews. 
 What about her personal life? 
 That's... complicated. 
 Is there something you'd like to tell us?

 Lori loved Gary, but she didn't want him to be a part of her professional life. 
 She was traveling all the time. 
 Oh? She travel recently? 
 Three weeks ago. LA with Craig.

 Gary doesn't know.

 I can't believe Lori Oliver is dead. 
 That was so intense. 
 Yeah, it was. 
 I mean, she just... she died right there.

 Yeah, I know, Doug. 
 It's very sad. 
 Seriously, though. 
 Have you ever seen anything like that?

 Hmm. 
 Lucas : What are those? 
 "Mees' lines." 
 Mees' lines? 
 It's a symptom of heavy metal toxicity. 
 It grows out with the nail. 
 Well, based on that, can you estimate when she was poisoned? 
 Some time within the last three weeks. 
 And you think it was mercury? 
 Not at this concentration. 
 I think it was dimethylmercury. 
 Which is? 
 One of the most potent neurotoxins out there. 
 It attacks your nervous system and causes irreversible brain damage. 
 And it's slow-acting. 
 What's this stuff used for? 
 These days? Nothing. 
 So accidental exposure is unlikely? 
 Highly. This was intentional. 
 How much do you need to kill someone? 
 Put out your hand. 
 ♪ 
 I'd have just killed you. 
 Flynn : Okay. Um... 
 We believe Lori was poisoned sometime in the last three weeks. 
 Who would do something this cruel? 
 Well, we're hoping you can help us with that. 
 If we can figure out when Lori was exposed to the poison, it might help us identify her killer. 
 You were with Lori in LA, yes? 
 Yes, but we barely saw each other. 
 Other sources say differently, sir. 
 What are you implying? 
 That your relationship with Lori wasn't purely professional. 
 Yeah, I am not going to sit here and listen to you defame Lori on the day... that she died! 
 Vega. 
 Look.

 What are you doing? What's wrong? 
 We're gonna get you to a hospital, sir. 
 We need paramedics in here! 
 You've been poisoned. 
 That's a picture of Craig's index finger and Lori's index finger. 
 Well, the mees' lines are roughly in the same spot. 
 Does that mean they were poisoned... at the same time? 
 Exactly. 
 Then why did Lori die sooner? 
 Well, she had 60 times the toxic limit and he had only six times. She just got a bigger dose. 
 Okay, but he's got no chance of survival, right? 
 Right. The lower dosage just means he'll live long enough to experience all of the toxin's effects. 
 Flynn : That's a... that's a big team of doctors. 
 Yeah. Apparently, dimethylmercury poisoning makes me quite a prize, from a, you know, research standpoint. 
 Huh. We, um... 
 We need you to clarify a few things. 
 Yeah. Of course. I'm not going anywhere. 
 There's no chance of survival. I'm a dead man walking. 
 How long were you and Lori a couple? 
 Started during her first book tour. 
 We've been on and off for years. 
 Tell us about the last month. 
 We were together in LA, and then I went to New York for two weeks. 
 Did you see her before the writers' conference? 
 Yeah, the Saturday night I got back from New York. 
 I spent the night at her place. 
 Gary was, uh, away on business. 
 Yeah? When was that? 
 The 17th. 
 The 17th? Okay, we're gonna have to search your apartment, in case you brought anything contaminated back there. 
 Yeah. I don't need it much longer. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 We'll see you soon. 
 Don't let him get away with this. 
 Who? 
 Gary. 
 Who else? 
 Gary : Can you tell me exactly what it is you're looking for? 
 Vega : We can't share specific information with you just yet, but we can confirm that it was poison. 
 We'd like you to get tested, just to make sure that you haven't been exposed. 
 You think I'm involved? 
 No. We didn't say that. 
 Please, Detective. My wife was a mystery writer. 
 Your first suspect is usually the spouse. 
 That is usually the case, yes, sir. 
 Well, not in this case. 
 I couldn't hurt my wife. I loved her. 
 The doctor will be in touch. 
 Tell you what. If he does know about the affair, he's certainly hiding it well. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Who only keeps their hate mail? 
 Some people don't think they deserve happiness. 
 Anything jump out at you yet? 
 Any of these people could've killed her, as far as I can tell. 
 What's with the stacks? 
 Oh, well, this is the "I hate you, so you must die." 
 The "I love you, so you must die." 
 And "I want to wear your skin as a suit" stack. 
 Any mention of dimethylmercury or poison in general? 
 No. 
 Any luck finding a source? 
 No. Hardly anyone carries it anymore. 
 And the suppliers that do sell it have extensive purchase restrictions. 
 Okay, so you can't order it online. 
 Is it hard to make? 
 According to the people that I talked to... you create an amalgam of mercury and sodium, and then you combine that amalgam with methyl iodide. 
 Okay, yeah, not hard. 
 No. But without the proper equipment, could be extremely dangerous.

 What do we know?

 And then together again on the 17th. 
 Now, Betty said that the poisoning could've happened at any time in the last three weeks. 
 So that's here. 
 One, two, three. 
 So that means they were most likely exposed to the DMM on the night of the 17th, Flynn: Uh-huh. the day they slept together. 
 Are... are we interrupting you? 
 Nope. I'm good. 
 Everything so far has tested negative for dimethylmercury. 
 But is everything here? 
 Looks like it's all here. 
 Are you sure it could be in something like her shampoo? 
 Well, it's possible. 
 Anywhere else she might leave personal items? 
 Did you check her purse? 
 Everything in her purse would've been tested. 
 Maybe it's something that she got for Craig? 
 Or from him? 
 Her perfume. 
 Ghost orchid. It was Craig's favorite. 
 She took it everywhere. 
 Well, forensics did not find that in either Craig or Lori's house. 
 No. I just bought her a new bottle. 
 When? 
 The 14th. 
 I tried it when I bought it for her. 
 Craig : W-w-wait, wait. 
 You're saying someone poisoned her perfume? 
 It was a new bottle, and now it's missing.

 You know he never admitted to meeting Lori Oliver, yet he was there when she died. 
 According to your other suspect, a student who actually wrote about using dimethylmercury as a weapon. 
 Okay, Sam. There's more than enough here for a warrant. 
 You want me to convince a judge? 
 First, you have to convince me. 
 Okay, what do you need to be happy? 
 Residual chemical traces on his person might be nice. 
 Maybe an actual connection between him and the victim. 
 Um... This is our guy. 
 This is a fishing expedition. 
 Why are you stonewalling us? 
 Because I don't like surprises. 
 ♪ 
 Mr. Hess? 
 Doug. 
 Can I help you? 
 I wanted to tell you about a new story I'm working on. 
 I don't have time, Doug. 
 This guy... thinks he got away with murder. 
 But the problem is, he didn't cover his tracks as well as he thought. 
 Okay... 
 So what does he do next? 
 Uh, I don't know, Doug. It's your story. 
 What do you think he does next? 
 Well, I think he goes to the police to confess. 
 Why would he do that? 
 Because if he doesn't, someone might turn him in. 
 Well, someone had better have more than just a story for the police. 
 He has evidence. 
 Lori Oliver's pen that the killer planted on him.

 We've gone through Dustin Hess's life. 
 There's no connection. 
 Vega : There's got to be one. 
 Flynn : Okay. 
 Let's try it from Lori Oliver's side. 
 What do we know? 
 Her employment records showed she was as a reader for Mr. Davis's literary agency. 
 Interesting. 
 What did Gary say? Gary said... she "Could be ruthless when she wanted something." 
 Nah, that was his anger talking. 
 Yeah. Sometimes, that's when the truth comes out. 
 What did she want, more than anything else? 
 Her career. 
 Right? I mean, she wanted to... to be number one. 
 Well, Dustin teaches creative writing. 
 Those who can't do, teach? 
 And Lori was a reader, so would've been a gatekeeper for all the publishers. 
 Maybe she read his work. 
 Turned down a manuscript, and she's the reason he's teaching. 
 Could you tell us if a "Dustin Hess" ever submitted a book to you? 
 Pass me my laptop. 
 Do you keep the readers' reports on file? 
 Yes. 
 It's the best way to protect myself from a lawsuit. 
 Need help? 
 My motor skills are going. 
 Next, they say it's the dementia. 
 But not before I lose my eyesight. 
 And then I get to die. 
 Craig, your help has really been essential. 
 It won't be for nothing, sir. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh... 
 "Dustin Hess." 
 Yes. He submitted five years ago. 
 "A Perfect Murder." 
 Lori read that manuscript, didn't she? 
 [Door opens] 
 How are you doing, Dustin? 
 Fine. 
 Would you like anything? Some water? 
 So you can collect my DNA? 
 Please. 
 Oh. Partner, we're not gonna get him with any of our tricks. 
 Doesn't seem so. 
 Why don't we try some evidence? 
 Okay. [Sighs] 
 What's this? 
 That is the release form that you signed when you submitted your manuscript to Craig Davis's company, which gave us the connection between you and Lori Oliver. 
 It's Lori's first book. 
 Well, your first book, really, let's be honest. 
 The similarities are remarkable. 
 But you already knew that, didn't you?

 Lori Oliver stole your book, so you took her life in return. 
 Do you really think I'd murder somebody for a book? 
 Yes. 
 But why would you wait five years? 
 Was it nerves? 
 Take you that long to work up the courage? 
 Lori : Really, if you think about it, Dickens, Austen, Hell, Shakespeare, these guys were writing popular characters in their days. 
 Today, you'd call them The Literary Crowd, but... 
 [Lecture continues, indistinct] 
 Vega : Or did it take you that long to discover a method? 
 Doug Butcher... now, he came up with one hell of a murder weapon. 
 Vega : Which you stole. 
 [Scoffs bitterly] 
 Which I "stole." 
 Roars : She stole my character! 
 My life! 
 And she didn't even remember my name!

 The least you can do is forgive me. 
 No.

 Hallucinations are the worst side effect of anything. 
 Mm. Depending on who you talk to. 
 What? 
 Hmm? 
 So I am thinking about dinner. Your favorite, TacoFino. 
 I'll buy if you pick up. 
 Ooh! You had me at "Taco". 
 I had you at dinner. 
 You did. 
 I'll see you in a bit. 
 See you in a bit. 
 Lucas, how are you? 
 Good. 
 Yeah? 
 You, uh, you wanna tell me when Mary left you? 
 Uh, about a week ago. 
 How did you know? 
 I've been there. 
 The... the first month's always the hardest. 
 Yeah, then it gets better? 
 No. No. It just, uh, gets less hard. 
 You know, then it gets easier, and then, uh, eventually it gets, uh... It gets a little better.

 Oscar said you could use some quality time. 
 Oh, he did, huh? 
 He's a wise man. 
 So. 
 So? What's up? 
 Uh, I have to testify at a trial, that's all. 
 But that's part of your job, isn't it? 
 Yeah, yeah. But this time, it's a little different, because I... have to testify for the defense. 
 Well, they... they know you're a cop, right? 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah. Yeah, they know I'm a cop. 
 But they, um, they also think that I know some information that could discredit the officer who's responsible for the arrests. 
 Well, uh, do you? 
 Uh... 
 Do you remember Mark? 
 Of course, you remember Mark. 
 Yeah, I remember him. 
 He's the officer in question. 
 Ten years ago, he and I made a... we made a big mistake, and two people died because of it. 
 And I lied about it. 
 [Sighs] Mom... what's gonna happen with the case, then? 
 I don't know. 
 Because if I tell the truth, a lot of really bad people could go free. 
 [Chuckles] Well... you're gonna have to tell the truth. Right? 
 You know, whenever I'm unsure about the choices that I've made in my life, I just have to look at you, and I know I did one thing right.
