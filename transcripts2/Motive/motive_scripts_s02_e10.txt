 Good morning, Mr. Rivera. 
 Morning, Diego. Take good care of her. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Hey, sir. 
 Hector. 
 She's looking good. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I really like my work. 
 I'm just sorry I won't be able to stay. 
 Why not? 
 My visa application was denied. 
 I see. Do you want to stay? 
 Of course, who wouldn't? 
 So let me take care of it. 
 Can you? 
 You're not the first one to have this problem. 
 Gracias. 
 Come on, almost... 
 [Grunting with effort] 
 Thank you, Isabelle. 
 You must be getting very excited about getting to ride a horse. 
 Mm, yeah, I guess. 
 What's wrong? 
 Well, what if I fall off? 
 I'll tell you a secret. 
 When I hemmed your pants, I sew in a big hug, so you'll always be safe and protected. 
 Oh, mom. 
 Do you like my new outfit? 
 [Chuckling] Very pretty. 
 But why are you wearing your boots in the house? 
 Oh, um, Isabelle was just helping me try them on. 
 They're going to scuff the floor. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Vikki. 
 I take them off. 
 This is a crime scene, people. 
 Let's get these horses out of here. 
 So this is John Rivera. 
 Yup. Multiple broken bones, massive trauma to the chest and torso. 
 He was trampled? 
 By his own horse, apparently. 
 See, I don't know from horses. 
 Do they do that to their owners? 
 No, something definitely spooked the horse. 
 We have a time of death? 
 Between 8:00 and 11:00 PM. 
 You going to go with accidental or suspicious death? 
 Nice try. 
 Is this the victim's car? 
 It's the only one here. 
 Aston Martin, very cool. 
 Except for the insurance premiums. 
 Killjoy. 
 Hey, check it out. 
 Two cinder blocks. 
 Yeah, and a length of rope. 
 If I had a car this nice, I'd keep that stuff in the trunk. 
 It's open. 
 Go get Detectives Flynn and Vega. 
 The trunk was open a crack, so I took the liberty... 
 Well, well, well. 
 Cinder blocks, rope, and now plastic sheeting. 
 Somebody planned ahead. 
 Yeah, it makes it look more like a murder. 
 Yeah, but who uses a horse as a murder weapon? 
 That's the question. 
 And why didn't they dispose of the body? 
 That's another good question. 
 And why did they leave the car behind? 
 You are on a roll, partner. 
 Let's run the plates. 
 [Crying quietly] 
 Hello, Isabelle, can I help? 
 I don't know. 
 You know you're not alone, not in his house. 
 I'll pray with you. 
 What are you praying for? 
 Forgiveness. 
 Lucas : I ran the plates on the vehicle. 
 Flynn : Mm-hmm. 
 The car belongs to a Jennifer Rivera, the victim's wife. 
 Oh, that old cliche. 
 I tried her home and her cell, no answer. 
 Okay, so we may have a runner. 
 Put out a bulletin. 
 And check on the house in person. 
 Okay. 
 As soon as I saw him, I knew he was dead. 
 I called the police right away. 
 We really appreciate that. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Did you know John Rivera well? 
 Since I came to work here. 
 Uh-huh. 
 He was always very kind. 
 Do you have any idea what would make his horse trample him like that? 
 Esperanza does get nervous sometimes around crowds and strangers. 
 But I've never seen anything like this. 
 Was John in the habit of being here late at night? 
 No. 
 After dinner, the club is usually closed and empty. 
 If he wanted to work with Esperanza, he would have told me. 
 So why was he here, then? 
 I'm sorry. I don't know. 
 Excuse me, Mrs. Vikki. 
 Hi, Isabelle. 
 Oh, I'm just going over Becky's birthday list. 
 Could I talk to you for a moment? 
 Sure. 
 Do I need to buy a cake, or can I get you to make one from scratch? 
 Mrs. Vikki, I have to go home. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 My mother, back home, she's very sick. 
 My God, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 If you want to Skype her, you can use the computer in the den. 
 No, you don't understand, um... 
 I have to go home. 
 What if I give you some more money this month to send back to your mom? 
 Does she need any prescriptions? 
 If I could just please have my passport. 
 It's just a bad time. 
 I have a million things to do, and I'm going to need your help. 
 I'll be back in a few days. 
 Plus, it would break Becky's heart if you missed her birthday party. 
 You're one of the family now. 
 So if there's anything I can do, you just let me know. 
 Greetings to our two newest members. 
 Thank you, Mr. Rivera, for sponsoring us. 
 It means a lot. 
 Always on the lookout for good people. 
 And you, milady, welcome to Green Point. 
 Wh-where's my horse? 
 He just had his lunch. 
 All set for your first practice? 
 Yeah, our nanny's bringing Becky's outfit and her gear. 
 Great. 
 In the meanwhile, let me give you the official member tour. 
 The show trials are just getting underway. 
 Can I help you? 
 Jennifer Rivera? 
 Detective Brian Lucas. 
 I'm afraid I've got some bad news. 
 Oh, my God, this can't be happening. 
 I know, it's a shock. 
 We do have a few questions to ask you, though, okay? 
 There were, uh, cinder blocks in your car, as well as a coil of rope. 
 And your trunk was lined with plastic. 
 Did you know that? 
 I-I'm sorry, I don't know... 
 But no, I-I didn't. 
 I wasn't using the car this week. 
 Well, would there be anybody else who would have access to it? 
 Why does the car matter? My husband's dead. 
 I know, and I'm sorry again. 
 We apologize. 
 We realize this is a very difficult time for you. 
 It's just we have to investigate all our angles. 
 Investigate? 
 Wait, are you saying John's death wasn't an accident? 
 We are currently treating his death as suspicious, yes. 
 But he was killed by his horse. 
 Just for our information, where were you last night? 
 Up in Whistler. 
 John bought me a... a spa getaway for me and my girlfriends. 
 He was always doing things like that for me. 
 I think it's time...  for the chairman of the board to do his thing. 
 I think you're right. 
 Fellow board members, may I have your attention, please? 
 I would like to take this opportunity to welcome a new member to our family. 
 Let's all raise our glasses to Victoria Hill. 
 Welcome to Green Point. 
 What was your name again? 
 In fact, I want all your names. 
 Officer Wendy Sung. 
 And Detective Brian Lucas. 
 Detective? 
 Then maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on? 
 Holding my daughter for questioning? 
 Yes, sir. 
 If you'll just come with me. 
 I'll have my attorneys on your ass if I don't get some answers. 
 Well, then let's get you those answers. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Becky : Isabelle! 
 I can't find my socks! 
 Where are they? 
 I'm coming! 
 I don't understand. 
 I thought this was an accident. 
 You don't actually think John was murdered? 
 Do you know anyone who'd want to hurt your son-in-law? 
 No. No, of course not. 
 Oh, my God. 
 My poor daughter. 
 When can I see her? 
 Well, we're almost done here, sir. 
 You own the Green Point Equestrian Center, is that right? 
 I'm the primary shareholder, yes. 
 John was on the board of directors? 
 Chairman, as of a few weeks ago. 
 He made friends fast. 
 He moved up quickly. 
 Quickly enough to offend anyone? 
 John? No. 
 Quite the opposite, in fact. 
 No, the other members really responded to him. 
 So did the investors. 
 Are you sure that this wasn't an accident? 
 We're not sure of anything just yet. 
 Where were you between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM last night? 
 Home. Why? 
 You have anyone who can confirm that? 
 My wife, Margery. 
 This is going to kill her. 
 She thought the world of John. 
 [Knock on glass] 
 Yeah, what's up? 
 The victim's wife's alibi checks out. 
 Three of her friends can vouch for her that they were in Whistler until they drove back this morning. 
 Why do you look so happy? 
 Because I just started drilling into the victim's financials. 
 Ooh, what did you find? 
 Three days ago, he reserved a boat rental. 
 A boat, huh? 
 Yeah, a small motor boat, which he was supposed to pick up today. 
 So it made me start to wonder... 
 Right, right, the plastic, the cinder blocks, the rope... 
 Wrap the body in plastic, attach the weights, and throw it overboard. 
 What if John wasn't supposed to be the victim? 
 What if he went there to kill someone? 
 We've been looking at this case backwards. 
 That wouldn't be the first time. 
 John Rivera was not the victim. 
 Oh, but he was. He's dead. 
 No, but he's not the intended victim. 
 He went there intending to kill. 
 Well, the would-be killer... 
 Right, you get my point. 
 Mm-hmm. So instead of trying to find who'd want to kill John, we have to flip our focus. 
 Right. Right, the real question is who would John want to kill? 
 And why? 
 We found the car prepped for disposal, but no murder weapon on the scene. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 Saved by the bell. Doctor Betty has an update. 
 Okay. 
 It is you. 
 I can't believe this. 
 I can explain everything. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Dressed like this, with these people? 
 Listen, I admit I've done things I'm not proud of, but... it hasn't been easy for me. 
 Easy for you? What about me? 
 You're in this country now. 
 Isn't that what you wanted? 
 Do you have any idea what my life has been like? 
 This is not how it was supposed to be. 
 Vikki : Isabelle! 
 There you are. 
 Go to the car and get the camera, because I want to record Becky's first ride. 
 [Chuckles awkwardly] 
 Yes, Ms. Vikki. 
 She is having the best time. 
 She's doing great! 
 Do you wanna see? 
 [Stifling tears] 
 [Sighs, shakily] 
 Don't cry. 
 I heard what you said back there. 
 You were listening? 
 I'm sorry, but I think I understand. 
 I am just like you, illegal. 
 But Mr. Rivera is going to help me. 
 He can help you too. 
 [Sobs] 
 It's a tiny prick. 
 The ribcage was crushed, and the bruising masked the puncture point. 
 That's why I missed it on my initial exam. 
 A puncture, like, as in a needle? 
 Hypodermic. 
 Oh. Well, what did the tox screen say? 
 Ketamine. 
 Veterinarians use it to tranquilize animals. 
 Including horses? 
 It's also one of the most stolen drugs from vet clinics. 
 Yeah, sold on the street as Special K. 
 Yeah, but this was no recreational dose. 
 Our guy was juiced up with it. 
 Enough to kill him? 
 Oh, he would have experienced immediate and extensive hypertension, tachycardia, blurring, loss of vision. 
 Right, right, so in other words, if the horse hadn't trampled him, then... 
 He would have been dead within minutes. 
 [Latch clicks] 
 [Spring snaps] 
 [Beeping in code] 
 [Beeping in code] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hill residence. 
 Stern voice : Victoria hill? 
 Uh, no, sorry, Ms. Hill is not at home. 
 May I take a message? 
 May I ask your name? 
 Isabelle Flores. 
 I am the nanny here. 
 This is Cathedral Security calling. 
 The phone call is being recorded for quality assurance. 
 Do you know the password? Uh... Budapest. That's correct, thank you. Our computers are registering three false attempts to open your safe. Is everything okay? Y-yes. Everything is fine. Do you need us to notify the police? No, no, no. Um, the child was playing with the safe. I... I told her to stop. So you're confirming that neither you nor any of the occupants are in jeopardy, correct? Yes. Yes. Everything is fine. Thank you very much, ma'am. Have a nice day. Baby, it's 3:00 in the morning. [Chuckling] Hey there. I just couldn't sleep. Is something the matter? No, nothing. Are you sure? I've got the perfect wife. The perfect life. What could be wrong? You go back to bed. I'll be up in a minute. You've got 30 seconds, mister. [Sighs heavily] Hi. I got a call about a safe for a Victoria Hill. Isabelle : I am Victoria Hill. Please, come in. Thank you. My daughter was playing with the safe. I... I think she broke it. Yeah, it sounds like you're just locked out. Oh, can you fix it? Open it? Yeah, it shouldn't be a problem. I just need to see some ID from you. ID? Um, yeah, driver's license. Something with a picture on it. Um, I don't drive. And my passport is in the safe. So you have nothing? In that case, ma'am, I'm afraid I can't help you. [Sighs] So I think I found the source of the ketamine. Do tell. The equestrian center vet says that he filled out a prescription the day before John died. Okay, so we have a killer, and now we know where he got his murder weapon. Just one small wrinkle. We don't like wrinkles. Well, you might like this one. The ketamine prescription wasn't filled out for John. It was for a Hector Cabrillo. 
 
 Good morning. Oh, my God. What... What's the occasion? You are. Pie for breakfast? Anybody can do bacon and eggs. [Gasping] This is why I love you. Open it. A spa getaway to Whistler? For you and your girlfriends. What about you? I've got too much work to catch up on. Okay, it's now official. Best husband ever. [Laughs] Come here. What about your breakfast? Can't a girl work up an appetite? Hector Cabrillo. You hold a Nicaraguan passport. You know what happened when I called immigration? They told me that your visa had expired four months ago. Hector, you're already here illegally. I would advise you to talk to us. I don't want any trouble. No, of course you don't. That's why you're going to tell us the truth. Look, we know you bought the drugs. I did pick up the ketamine, but it wasn't for me. It was for Mr. Rivera. Did he say... Hector, put the rake down, please. Thank you. Did he say what he wanted it for? Esperanza, his horse. Did he usually treat his own horse? Isn't that something a vet would do? Yes. You didn't think that was strange? Yes, but... I don't want to question. Mr. Rivera's death is now officially a murder investigation. Where were you at the time he was killed? I fell asleep in the hay barn. That's not a very good alibi. I didn't kill Mr. Rivera. I swear. But I did see him arguing with someone. When? Yesterday. With who? His father-in-law. Well, did you hear what they were arguing about? No, but Mr. Rivera was pretty angry. Why didn't you tell us this yesterday? I was afraid. I'm not supposed to be in this country. Okay, we're going to be in touch. You stay put, you understand? I wonder what they were fighting about. I think Hector has an overactive imagination. So you did not have an argument with your son-in-law? I wouldn't call it that. What would you call it? A misunderstanding, at most. Can you elaborate? I asked John to join the board of my oil company. He not only had a way with horses, he had a way with people. So what was the misunderstanding? My company runs a standard background check on all new executives. He got upset when he heard that we'd started one. Why is that? I guess he felt it was an invasion of his privacy. At any rate, I called it off. Peace in the family at all costs. And did you feel he was trying to hide anything? No. But he did seem a little on edge the last two or three days. How so? Anxious, distracted. Other than that, John was solid. He came from good stock from El Salvador. Mining and politics. Poised for a great career here. I certainly had no reason to kill him. [Unzipping case] [Breathing hard] [Knocks] Hey, guys. What do you got? Weirdness. I looked into the boat rental. For all we know, John just liked to fish. So I tried to go back a little further to see if he'd ever rented a boat before. Mm-hmm. I'm sensing a shoe about to drop. All of John's credit cards are all only a year old. Same with his bank accounts. And they're all joint, with his wife, Jennifer. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it gets better. I dug a little deeper, and there's no record of a John Rivera beyond a year ago. It's like he didn't exist. Hmm, maybe that's 'cause he didn't. False identity? Yeah, it would explain why he got so upset about the background check, too. Yeah, okay, well, if he wasn't John Rivera, who was he? We're wondering how you and John met. It was at a polo party, about a year ago. I was just coming off a broken engagement, so I certainly wasn't looking. But there was John. Handsome, charming. He swept me off my feet. Where was John from, and what was he doing before you met him? He came from El Salvador. His family was well connected, but a new government regime took most of their assets, and he fled here. He was looking for a fresh start. I suppose we both were. Did you meet his family and his friends from back home? No, his parents are dead. And John had very strong feelings about his country. Once he left, he promised he'd never go back. Did you notice any recent changes in his behavior? No. Well, not really. I think he had something on his mind lately. Mmm... how so? Three nights ago, I woke up to find him drinking alone in the dark. So he was worried about something? That's what I asked him. But he said no, everything was okay, and we went back to bed. But then... the next night, it happened again. And he didn't tell you what was troubling him? No. [Bell tolling] Isabelle? What's wrong? I was watching you during service. I want to go home, but my boss has my passport. Idiots. They think they own us. The same thing happened to my cousin. What did she do? She got a new passport. How much? $500. It takes a couple of days, maybe three. I don't know. I have been lied to before. Here's his number. When you want to be free again, you call him. You promised me a wonderful life in a new world. My life is not wonderful. What are you talking about? After all the money I gave you... Quiet. People will hear. Good! Let them. I'm so sorry it had to come to this. You are not sorry. You are nothing but a liar and a thief, and it's time everybody knew. [Horse screaming] I fought hard for this life. I'm not going to give it up now. We still don't know who John Rivera was a year ago. Yeah, well, we do know what he was up to lately. Yeah, he'd been in the stables trying to kill somebody. But who? It's not every day that the victim is also a murderer. Wow, thank you for that, Lucas. Okay, so, three days ago, John reserves a boat rental. Yeah. And his credit card statement shows that that's also when he purchased the rope, cinder blocks, and plastic. And also when his wife, Jennifer, gets up in the middle of the night, finds him drinking alone. Right, which tracks with the observation his father-in-law made that he was feeling anxious about something. Right, so something in John's life has changed. Right, something that drove him to plot murder. What happened three days ago? So, we backtracked John's calendar entries. He's got weekly finance meetings, weekly board meetings. Nothing's out of the ordinary on Monday except for this meeting he had at the equestrian center. How was that out of the ordinary? It was a new member who was scheduled for a tour of the facilities. So it's the person that's out of the ordinary. All right, who is it? Her name is Victoria Hill. Which rang a bell, so I checked John's phone records. The morning of his death, he called Victoria Hill's home. Could have been a social call. One way to find out. Yes, sir. ♪ You look so cute. Ooh, wanna see my horse? I do, I really do, but first I need to talk to your mom for a minute. Okay, come on, honey, push. I'm trying. Isabelle did it last time. Okay, but Isabelle's not here right now. Who's Isabelle? My nanny. Oh, you have a nanny too. You're one lucky girl. Okay, I'm going to go find my horse. Bye, guys. Have fun. I know, I know, I probably spoil her, but ever since the divorce, it's the least I can do, right? We'd like to talk to you about John Rivera. Oh, my God. I couldn't believe it when I heard. You had an appointment with him on Monday? Uh, orientation. Yeah, I've been trying to get into Green Point for months, and our sponsorship finally went through, thanks to John. And why was John so helpful? He was just a nice guy. He liked to help people. So you two weren't... extra close. No. I mean, he was married. Oh, I know, but you're not. No, it wasn't like that. I'm not like that. Where were you last night between 8:00 and 11:00 PM? I was at my mother's. Becky and I did a sleepover. According to John's phone record, he called your house at 8:00 AM on the morning of the day he died? Maybe he did, but like I said, I was at my mother's. Hmm, well, the call didn't go to voicemail. It lasted a whole minute. Sorry, that must be a mistake. Isabelle! I was just putting in another load. The security company just called me. Someone set off the alarm. Uh, yes, they called me too. I told them it was a mistake. But they also said they got a call from a locksmith, wanted to make sure that I called one. I didn't. Did you? What is going on? I wanted my passport. So you tried to break into my safe? It is my passport. Hi. What's... what's wrong, Isabelle? Nothing, dear. Isabelle's not happy here anymore. She wants to leave us. So she's going to miss my birthday party? Ask her. I'm sorry, I know I didn't clean my room yet. No, it's not your fault. And I would never miss your party. [Dialing] [Call ringing] So last Monday, John welcomes Vikki Hill and her daughter to the Green Point Equestrian Center. Right, and three days later, on the morning of the murder, John calls Vikki Hill's house and talks to someone for one minute. We've confirmed that Vikki and her daughter weren't there. They were at her mother's place. Right, so who did John talk to if the family wasn't home, then? Yeah. Didn't she say she had a nanny? What was her name? Yeah, we got that. That's here somewhere. Her name, Isabelle Flores. All right, let's see if we can find a connection between her and our vic. Mm-hmm. Are you coming? I'll be there in a sec. [Knocking] Sir? Hey, I thought you were on your way out. Angie's just bringing the car around. May I? Yeah, what can I do for you, Oscar? Well, my partner does not know we are having this conversation, sir. And what conversation is that? Well, Angie's been asked to testify as a character witness for you, the league of nations trial. She has, yeah. Apparently the defense may bring into question a case that happened ten years ago, the Dyer shooting? Yeah, I'm aware. I'm also aware that you read the original incident report. See, records has Angie checking it out, but, well, you were the one that returned it. Yes, sir, I read the report. It was a shooting that happened back when you two were partners. And we were cleared by IA, so... Anything else? She's a good cop, sir. She's a good partner, and I, uh, I don't want anything to change that. I'll try and make sure it doesn't. I am glad to hear that, sir. Thank you. Isabelle : No, I don't remember any phone call. Flynn : But you were around yesterday morning? Yes, but I could have been in the laundry, or taking out the garbage. Vega : Well, I'm sure they've got you doing the cooking and the cleaning too? And you take care of the daughter? Yes. Hmm. Sounds like they keep you busy. Mrs. Vikki likes a clean home. I'm going to ask you something. Do you recognize this gentleman? John Rivera? No. Hmm. You never saw him at the equestrian center? I don't think so. Well, last Monday, you were at the equestrian center with Victoria and Becky. Was that your first time? Yeah. You know, I have to tell you, your English is very good. [Chuckles] Thank you. I studied before I came. Where are you from? Uh, a small town in El Salvador. Do you ever miss it? Every day. But you're here to stay now, right? I mean, in case we have any other questions? Sure. Yes. Okay. Okay, thank you. That's okay, we'll see our way out. Thanks. Hey, did you notice how she avoided looking at John's picture? Mm-hmm. If she's illegal, it would explain why she didn't come forward. Mm-hmm. But why would John want to kill her? Hey, maybe this all goes back to him being exposed. Right. He's cagey about his past in El Salvador. That's where Isabelle's from. Maybe she knows what he's hiding. A blackmail? I don't know. She doesn't seem like the type. I don't know, she seems overworked, and I bet she's underpaid. Okay, so we find out how Isabelle got here. Mm-hmm. Angie, it's Samantha. Are you avoiding my calls? I need your testimony in the Cross case. Call me back. Partner. Hmm? You're going to like this. Isabelle Flores, native of El Salvador. Check that out. Wow. She came in a year ago on a six-month visa. Yeah, and she stayed here illegally, which is probably why she looked nervous. Did you see that her birthplace is listed as Esperanza, El Salvador. John's horse's name. Is that a coincidence? Hey, Lucas, how's your Spanish? ÿDónde es el baño? Okay, good enough. Do me a favor, call the city hall in Esperanza, El Salvador, please. What am I looking for? Motive for murder. Find any kind of connection between John and Isabelle. Hello. More questions? Not for you, for Isabelle. Isabelle! She's gone. What do you mean she's gone? She took a taxi, and she left with her suitcase. When? Four hours ago. Okay, great. That's great work, Lucas. So he talked to the good folks of Esperanza. You were right about Isabelle. Damn, I was kinda hoping I was wrong about her. What about the cab? Where did they go? Okay, so she went to a Westside community church. Where's that? Fourth and Heather. Okay. Hi, Father. I'm Detective Angie Flynn. This is Detective Oscar Vega. And you're looking for Isabelle Flores. So she is here. She came seeking sanctuary. And you granted it? The church has a long history of offering shelter and protection to asylum seekers. No, we realize that, Father, but we're dealing with more than illegal immigration here. Detectives, please, is it a crime to want a better life? In this case, it is, yes. We know about your expired visa and your illegal status. That's why you asked the priest for sanctuary for a few days, isn't it? So we're guessing you're waiting for a new passport, maybe under a new name, that will safely get you out of the country. I know what I did was wrong, but I just want to go to my family, to go home. Mm-hmm, home to Esperanza. We checked with the local authorities, and we know you were born there. We know you owned a home there until last year when you sold it to come to this country. When we asked if you knew a John Rivera, you said no. You were telling the truth. But you do know this man. Domingo Flores. He's also your husband. We worked like dogs... Saved our money for years to send you here, to make a better life for us, not for you and your whore! She is my wife. I am your wife! I can't explain what I've done, but I never meant to hurt you. Then what was I supposed to think when you stopped answering my letters? I thought you were dead! I had no money, but I still came here looking for you. I scrubbed toilets to feed myself, and all along, you were living like a king. I wish you were dead. I searched for months trying to find him. I had given up. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't leave without knowing. Then a friend offered me another job, working as a nanny. The money wasn't better, but at least I had a clean bed. Last Monday, when Vikki Hill joined the equestrian center, that's when you finally found your husband. Except he wasn't, not anymore. He actually believed his lie. And he was willing to kill to keep his secret. You're nothing but a liar and a thief! And it's time everybody knew. [Slams into stall, horse screams] I fought really hard for this life. I'm not going to giving it up now. Domingo! [Horse screaming and stamping] [Grunts in pain] [Horse screaming in panic] [Horse screaming] [Shrill screams of panic] You came here to kill me. [Horse shrieking and stamping] [He grunts in pain] We found a partial fingerprint on the stable door. It doesn't belong to any of the staff. Is it yours? Yes. He named his horse "Esperanza," after the town where we were born, the place where we first met. In our language, "Esperanza" means "Hope." Domingo and I, we hoped for a new life in a new country. But this country, it changed him. It spoiled him. The man I married was not the man I killed. Hmm. [Sighs] You're going to have to come with us now. Forgive me. Angie... I'm going to need an answer. [Sighing] Yeah, I know, I know. I don't know what the problem is. You were Mark's first partner. Yes, I was. The defense is going to go after Cross on a professional level. I need to know I can count on your character testimony. I'm sorry, Samantha, you can't. I don't understand. Why not? You'll have to ask Mark that question.
