 Yesterday morning, this guy just came up and started shouting at Stan.

 Okay, so Stan was at a trial downtown, and he was waiting to testify. 
 He left for lunch, went to his car in the parking garage, and according to Dr. Allsop, was stabbed seven times in the chest and abdomen. 
 By a slim, spike-shaped weapon, like an ice pick, Betty said. 
 But I'm more interested in this trial he was gonna testify in. 
 Let's find out about that. 
 We can't just give up. 
 I have. 
 You should, too.

 That's true, but she says she was downtown shopping, and her purchases and store receipts bear that out. 
 Don't suppose there's any connection between her and the victim? 
 Not that we've found yet. 
 So you don't peg her as our killer? 
 No. It's too early to tell. 
 You always play things so close to the chest, Oscar?

 I park there. Is that a crime? 
 No, but murder is. 
 You think I did this? 
 No, we brought you in for your sparkling conversation. 
 Why would I kill him? 
 Tomorrow, there'll just be someone else to take his place. 
 Here's what I think. 
 I think you confronted and threatened Stan, and then today you followed him from the courthouse into the parkade, and you stabbed him seven times. 
 I didn't kill him. 
 Why should we believe you? 
 Because I saw who did. 
 That's amazing. 
 You actually saw the killer? 
 He saw the killer. 
 That's incredible.

 Nah, I only caught her from behind. 
 So you didn't see this mystery woman stabbing our victim, then, did you? 
 Like I said, I was leaving the garage. 
 Hey. Let me ask you something. 
 At what time did you realize that this was the killer? 
 When I heard on the news that this guy bit it. 
 Why didn't you come forward? 
 Now you want me to do your job for you? 
 Besides... 
 Figured she'd done a public service. 
 There's your witness, Susan, entering.

 Aw, yep. Here comes Mr. Personality, making his exit. 
 Well, the timing's right.

 Still no sign of Danny's mystery woman, though. 
 If she went out the pedestrian exit, it'd be behind this camera here.

 Cross : Look, our witness saw him speeding away, and he admits to parking in the garage. 
 Vega : Not on the rooftop level. 
 And so far, forensics can't place him there. 
 Security footage supports that. 
 It's a hell of a motive. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay, let's have it, what's your theory? 
 Well, why do you think I have a theory? 
 You're ever in a poker game with this one, her "Tell" never changes.

 I don't have a twitch. 
 You have a bit of a twitch. 
 Yeah. 
 A little bit. 
 So, you don't have a theory, then? 
 Well... 
 Let's... Let's just say, for argument's sake, that, uh... 
 Danny was telling the truth about the woman that he saw rushing out of the parkade. 
 We've been assuming that the killer drove out. 
 What if they walked out? 
 Mm. 
 Which is why the security camera was turned. 
 Yeah. 
 Good call. 
 I don't play poker. 
 And if I did, I'd win.

 Stan was gonna testify that Brad Hitchens fired the bullet that killed that child. 
 Could be the tipping point for a jury. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I went over Stan's notes. 
 He was basing his testimony on the angle of the bullet wound. 
 Uh, the height of the killer, the distance that it was fired from... 
 So? 
 So I also went over the original crime scene data. 
 Based on the evidence, there's no way that Stan's conclusions could make any sense. 
 Come again. 
 Brad Hitchens testified that there was a second child present, playing with a gun on the floor. 
 The gun accidentally went off and killed the other child. 
 And you believe him? 
 Rogers : It's not a question of belief. 
 The pathological evidence supports it. 
 The angle of the bullet wound tells me that the gun was fired from the floor, from a distance of several feet away. 
 So... 
 Stan made a mistake? 
 Not on something as straightforward as this. 
 Betts, if this wasn't a mistake, then it's a lie. 
 Was Stan feeling okay lately? 
 Fine. Why? 
 Well, I'm just wondering if he seemed different at all.

 Um... Was he confused? 
 Or forgetful? 
 No. He was in perfect health, both mentally and physically.

 So how do they get up there? 
 Exactly.

 Look at that. That's a partial footprint.

 Hey. I spoke to the real estate agent. 
 They sent me over all the details. 
 House was listed six days ago. 
 Five days before the murder? 
 Wait a minute. Sold in less than a week? 
 Probably because it was undervalued by almost 100k. 
 Wow. Someone was anxious to get outta town. 
 Vega : Mm-hmm. 
 Lucas : Just one strange thing. 
 It says here that the taxes were paid by a John and Diane Robinson. 
 Yeah, so not Torrance? 
 Maybe she went back to her maiden name after she split up with her husband. 
 Well, let's find her. 
 [Keys clacking] 
 Oh... 
 Last year, John and Diane's four-year-old son died. 
 Oh, my God... 
 Hey, Betts? 
 What do you want? 
 Bad time? 
 No. 
 Sorry. 
 I'm just still a little, uh... 
 Of course. No worries. 
 I'm testifying tomorrow. 
 [Exhales sympathetically] 
 Yeah? 
 I'd like to think I was doing justice to Stan's memory. 
 Well, you are. 
 They why do I feel like I'm betraying him? 
 Well, you have to do what's right for the case. 
 And for you. 
 Is that a new mascot? 
 No. 
 It was in the drawer with the boy's body. 
 Stan must've put it there. 
 Really? 
 I know. 
 Contamination of evidence. Blah, blah. 
 When Stan's granddaughter drowned... 
 What happened? 
 He dropped her off for a play date. 
 Went back a couple of hours later to pick her up, and she was face-down in the pool. 
 [Sighs deeply] Oh... 
 Man, that's tragic. 
 He tried to prosecute the couple later. 
 Said they were unfit parents even to their own children. 
 But he was unsuccessful? 
 Why all the interest? 
 [Takes a big breath] 
 Uh... Pfft. 
 The drowning, the Hitchens case, Stan's murder... I think they're all connected. 
 Seriously? 
 Mm-hmm. And I think the connection is Stan. 
 [Impatient sigh] 
 Hi, Diane. 
 We just have a few more questions. 
 If you don't mind. 
 Sure. 
 Flynn : Great. 
 You'll have to excuse the mess. 
 You never quite know how much stuff you have. 
 Yeah, sure. How long have you lived here? 
 Since Jackie was a baby, right? 
 That's a lot of life to pack into boxes. 
 Well, that's beautiful. 
 Is that Jackie? 
 That's Brian? 
 Losing a child... I can't even imagine. 
 You had, uh, said that you didn't know Dr. Stanley Matthews, but that's not exactly true, is it? 
 He was the coroner who testified at your husband's trial. 
 In fact, it was his testimony that swung the verdict to manslaughter. 
 You also said that you were not in the parking garage. 
 Flynn : But you were. Two nights ago. 
 Mom? 
 ♪ 
 13 hours before the murder, you went and moved the camera. 
 How long had you been thinking about it? 
 Did Stan remember you? 
 Sorry. I'm in a bit of a rush. 
 You destroyed my family. 
 I gave my testimony based on the facts as I saw them. 
 [Sob catches] 
 We loved Brian. 
 John never laid a finger on him! 
 Your son died in your husband's care. 
 It was his fault. 
 No! 
 He has to pay the price! 
 No! 
 Go to hell! 
 Ah! 
 Jackie and I had gone shopping for jeans for school. 
 John had had a beer with lunch and fallen asleep. 
 When he woke up, Brian wasn't breathing. 
 He'd... fallen and hit his head. 
 The autopsy report said that Brian had other bruises on him, older bruises. 
 John was teaching him to ride a bike. 
 Okay? He's... He's a boy. They fall. 
 That's what kids do. 
 He was having so much fun. 
 My husband did not beat our children. 
 And he did not deserve to go to prison. 
 ♪ 
 Baby-killer. 
 I hear you like to hurt children. 
 [Gasping and groaning] 
 ♪ 
 [Prison alarm buzzing] 
 [Alarm continues] 
 John? 
 John! John! 
 We were really good parents. 
 We had no history of social services, and yet Dr. Matthews decides that we're abusive? 
 It was insane! 
 Who was he to judge us? 
 First, you lose your son, then you lost your husband. 
 I'm sure you thought you had every right to avenge their deaths. 
 Ahh! 
 Now you die the way my husband died. 
 My innocent husband! 
 I am not confessing. 
 Vega : You don't have to. 
 We'll match the print we found in the stairwell to your work boot. 
 We have the murder weapon from your job site. 
 And you lied about being at work when Stan was murdered. 
 Flynn : Your daughter will be well taken care of. 
 I promise. 
 I understand why you did what you did, but you can't take the law in your own hands. 
 But Dr. Matthews did. 
 ♪ 
 You heading out? 
 I am. 
 Okay. 
 Detectives! Great work. Again. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 You know Samantha Turner, our star prosecutor? 
 Stop it, Mark. 
 Oscar, Angie, good to see you, and great work. 
 Thank you. So you're taking over the Hitchens case? 
 Yeah. The judge declared a mistrial. 
 We're starting from scratch on Monday. 
 And so I guess we'll be seeing a lot more of you? 
 Well, that's the plan. Shall we? 
 Nice seeing you guys. 
 Goodnight. 
 Have a good night. 
 Goodnight. 
 Vega : That is a nice suit. 
 That's one, two, three, four, five cases in the last seven years. 
 Each one involving the death of a child. 
 Yeah, or perceived negligence or outright abuse by the parents. 
 This first one happened just a couple months after his granddaughter's death. 
 [Rogers sighing] 
 Stan testifies in these cases, and each time, there are contradictions between the evidence collected and his testimony. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, he felt the system failed him, and he went on a mission. 
 Didn't want it to happen again. 
 [Sighs] Oh... 
 I can't believe Stan would do something like this. 
 Well, sometimes, people, they aren't who you think they are.
