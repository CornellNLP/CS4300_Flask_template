 ♪ I'm going out tonight I'm feelin' all right ♪  - All right! 
 Who is excited? 
 - This isn't Calgary. 
 - It's Calgary adjacent. 
 - It's Cock-ring. 
 - It's Coch-rane. 
 - Not what we were sold. 
 - Why do we have to live in Cock-ring? 
 - It's Coch-rane! 
 It's Coch-rane,  and it's where my office is. 
 So, let's not judge a book by its cover,  and see what our rental house has in store for us! 
 (Door latch clicks) 
 - Okay girls, let's go. 
 - Hey!

 - Anne! 
 - Lionel,  I am having an actual allergic reaction to this place,  like, my body is telling me to run. 
 - I think Jayme's scared. 
 - (Whimpers) 
 - Okay, yeah! 
 Yeah, I will... admit,  this place is a bit rustic. 
 (Cell phone chimes) 
 But, I mean, this is just a place  that we lay our heads at night. 
 - Guys? 
 - And also, Cochrane has so much to offer! 
 Mountains, and delicate women,  shops that sell nothing but fudge! 
 - Guys! 
 - Not to mention,  the great outdoors! 
 - Guys! 
 Both: What?! 
 ♪♪♪  - It's probably just for a couple weeks. 
 (Bell tolls) 
 Lionel: The wait is over! 
 I finally get to see my new office! 
 (Footsteps thud on stairs) 
 - Jayme, call the police. 
 - Please. 
 You love it. 
 - Take that hat off immediately. 
 What, are you going to a rodeo clown's funeral?! 
 - Well, it is my first day in an actual office,  with actual people, I thought black  would be a little more profesh. 
 (Coffee pours) 
 - Why are you dressed like Joe Exotic? 
 - Hey, I am not the exotic one, okay? 
 You two are. 
 I'm Joe Normal. 
 Joe Normal! 
 Alice, are you ready to line dance your way  into that new school for the big first day? 
 - I'm gonna miss the bus. 
 - Okay, I love you, bye! 
 And you, I know you miss your old friends. 
 But maybe, just maybe,  this is an opportunity to... 
 make a new posse. 
 So... 
 Alexa? 
 What are some cool coffee shops in Cochrane? 
 Alexa: I've found a few coffee shops:  Coffee Muggers on Fifth Street,  Coffee Muggers on Centre Avenue,  Coffee Muggers on First Street,  Coffee Muggers on Memorial Way. 
 - Coffee Muggers sounds awesome. 
 - Let's go meet some locals. 
 - All right! 
 And I got you a little somethin' somethin'!

 Hey! 
 ♪  - So you haven't heard anything? 
 I just figured it's two hours later in Toronto,  so maybe you heard? 
 - Honey, you gotta calm it down. 
 - I know, uh, they will read my book though, right? 
 - Of course they will, and they'll love it. 
 You don't get a title like "Running Your Own Train,"  and not crack it open. 
 - I guess, yeah. 
 Woman: So sorry about the wait on that. 
 And what would you fancy this morning? 
 - I'll have a Cortado, please. 
 - Is that coffee? 
 Natashia: Oh boy. 
 Hey, can she hear me? 
 Can you hear me?! 
 - Is she speaking to me? 
 - I think so, yeah. 
 - Yep, I can hear you, ma'am. 
 - Okay, listen. 
 A cortado is equal parts espresso and milk. 
 - So, a latte, then? 
 - No, it's actually smaller. 
 - Could you not just drink less of it? 
 - I'll just take a regular coffee. 
 - Okay. 
 Anne: Jesus Christ. 
 - (Sighs) 
 - Oh, I love your bobble Lady Helena! 
 - Thanks. 
 Lady Helena? 
 - She's kind of our mascot. 
 Birthed 12 children, and still rode bulls 'til the end. 
 - Is she-she's dead? 
 - Gored by a bull. 
 Right In front of her family. 
 - Holy sh1t! 
 - Yep. 
 Rumour has it she smiled at her husband and kids  even as the blood drained from her body. 
 (Ominous music) 
 Anyway, you have a good rest of your day.

 Nope.

 Stop it!

 (Scream plays in slow motion, deepens in pitch) 
 (Charms jingle) 
 Cheryl: You're baaaack! 
 - Stop! 
 Oh! 
 my God, stop it! 
 (Phone rings) 
 - And you said her birthday was... 
 - March third, 2016. 
 I could just write it down. 
 - I got it. 
 - Okay. 
 - Now, is it month first,  or day first... 
 - It's the same. 
 Three, three. 
 - Right. 
 (Keys click) 
 And her medical records? 
 - I left the 12th message at her old school. 
 They're gonna fax them over. 
 But she's basically vaccinated. 
 - "Basically?" - You know, all the hits. 
 - It's just that without a doctor's note,  I'm not sure we can admit her. 
 - Oh, I'm a doctor, can I just write her a note  until her records get here? 
 - (Reluctant) 
 Ah... 
 - Lynda! 
 She's a doctor,  it's not like she's gonna give this school polio! 
 - Don't start, Cheryl. 
 (Groans) 
 I'll update the list. 
 Excuse me. 
 - Thank you! 
 Actually, thank you! 
 - No problem. 
 Staff can be kinda tricky, but once you see their strings,  you can play 'em like a fiddle. 
 (Laughs) 
 I'm Cheryl. 
 - Anne Carlson. 
 - Okay, Doctor Carlson,  if you ever need a drink... 
 give me a call.

 Hey, are you guys in the marching band? 
 - And what are you, some type of genius, or something? 
 - What? 
 (Students chatter) 
 ♪♪♪  - And I believe that student council  shouldn't be the only voice on campus. 
 After all, what is democracy without opposition? 
 And that's where we come in. 
 And uh, maybe we could make this place  more tolerable for someone new. 
 Thank you, uh, we'll be meeting tonight in Room 1A,  and I uh, hope to see you all there. 
 (Laughs) 
 Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before. 
 - Uh, I just moved here. 
 And sorry if I was...

 Don't be. 
 It's always nice to see some fresh freckle... 
 Fresh faces around here. 
 - Thanks. 
 ♪♪♪  - This fluorescent lighting is awful, I would kill myself. 
 - Oh please, you've been here three minutes. 
 This place is great, it's just layered. 
 - You've been here three hours. 
 How layered can it be? 
 - You'd be surprised. 
 For starters, can you believe that nobody around here  dresses like this? 
 - I can, yeah. 
 - Also, it's a bit of a bad boys' club. 
 A couple of the guys are talking about  bringing tacos in on... 
 - Tuesdays? 
 - Nope, get this. 
 Thursdays! 
 (Laughs) 
 I'm telling you, this place is nuts! 
 - I'm glad you're so happy here. 
 (Small laugh) 
 - Did um... 
 the publisher call yet? 
 - Nope. 
 - Hey, don't worry, they will. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - In the meantime... 
 the corporate counselor here is going on mat leave. 
 - Mm! 
 - It's a good job. 
 Easy hours. 
 I could see if they're taking interviews,  if... 
 you're interested? 
 (Slurps) 
 - (Small laugh) 
 (Sobs) 
 - Oh God! 
 Honey! 
 Are you crying? 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Is the idea of working here really that painful? 
 - Yes! 
 - I'm sorry, I'm... 
 I'm really trying here, I am. 
 I just feel like yours and the kids' plus one. 
 - Okay. 
 How about this... 
 give it a year. 
 And if you still feel like you don't fit in, we'll leave. 
 But in the meantime, just try. 
 - (Sighs) 
 - I know it's different, but maybe... 
 different could be good for you right now. 
 - I mean, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 - Okay. 
 Great. 
 And I'm also puttin' myself out there, just so you know. 
 Accounting is starting a ska band,  and they asked if I would join. 
 - Oh sh1t! 
 - What's wrong? 
 - Are they gone? 
 Are my eyes gone? 
 - I don't know if you knew this,  but it's actually Cochrane Policy to walk  a new student home on their first day. 
 - (Laughs) 
 It is not. 
 - Oh, you're from Toronto, aren't you? 
 - How did you know? 
 - The accent gives it away. 
 "It is naaat!" - I do not sound like that! 
 - "I do naat sound like that?"  (Both laugh) 
 So uh, what was your old school like? 
 - I don't know. 
 People were kinda mean to me. 
 Maybe I was kinda dumb, too. 
 - Oh, honestly? 
 No, I-I don't buy it. 
 I've known you approximately four hours now,  and you've been nothing but a perfect lady. 
 - (Laughs) 
 Yeah, sure. 
 A "perfect lady."  - Well, that's how I see you. 
 You should see yourself that way, too. 
 Hey... 
 let's commemorate this moment. 
 - Huh? 
 (Rain patters) 
 - Alice? 
 - Wait! 
 What were you trying to... 
 - What were you... 
 - Nothing! 
 - I wanted to officially invite you to the CCC. 
 - Sorry, the what? 
 - The Cochrane Conservative Committee. 
 It's not as scary as it sounds, okay? 
 We are just trying to bring some common sense  back to people our age. 
 - Well... 
 I guess that doesn't sound so bad. 
 - Right? 
 And we don't let just anyone in. 
 - Wow. 
 Thank you.

 (Splashes)

 - (Sighs) 
 f*ck it. 
 ♪♪♪  Hmm! 
 So, Tomé, is it? 
 Am I saying that right? 
 - Mm-hmm, sure are. 
 But, I mean, most people just call us the Cutie Committee. 
 - Tomé, you call us that. 
 It makes us seem so arrogant. 
 - But, I mean, we are way cuter  than most of the moms at the school, so... 
 - You sure you don't want a drink, Anne? 
 - I-I would, it's just... 
 don't we have to pick up our kids from school? 
 - What are you, a cop? 
 (Laughs) 
 - She thinks that's funny  'cause her husband's a dumb cop. 
 - You can't call him dumb, Cheryl. 
 - But he is! 
 - Yeah,  but like, still, though! 
 (Cell phone buzzes) 
 - Oh! 
 Excuse me, I-I should take this. 
 (Chair scrapes) 
 - And that's all they said? 
 - An official pass. 
 - This was the last publisher. 
 I really needed this. 
 - You know what, just start a new book. 
 Go back to the well. 
 I'm sorry, honey. 
 (Beeps call off) 
 - (Huffs) 
 ♪♪♪  - So, how has the transition been? 
 - Yeah, fine, I guess. 
 - Bullshit. 
 - You hate it! 
 - We hated it at first, too. 
 I mean, honestly, drinking with this tampon  was the only thing that got me through it. 
 - Mm, for real. 
 It sure ain't city life. 
 - You guys moved here from cities? 
 - Oh, hell, yeah! 
 I used to be a financial planner. 
 - I made jewelry. 
 - That tracks. 
 - Yeah, who do you think hooked us up  with these screamers? 
 Wakes Terry up every f*cking night, I love it! 
 (Laughs) 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - Anyway, we're here for the year, you know,  for now, and then... 
 and then we'll see. 
 - Yeah, we all thought the move  would be temporary at first too,  but you know, time just kinda... 
 sneaks away on you around here. 
 - Uh-huh, sure does. 
 (Words echo in slow motion) 
 - Uh-huh.

 Val: Look at this place! 
 You know, I grew up in a town just like this. 
 A bonafide shithole. 
 But my parents and the police felt it was best  I get a fresh start elsewhere. 
 - (Laughs) 
 I'm sorry, the-the police? 
 - Oh. 
 You found your gang yet? 
 - Uh, not exactly. 
 - Well, they can be elusive. 
 Then again, once you're in, there's only one way out -  pound of flesh. 
 - Whoa. 
 Val, were you in a gang, gang? 
 - Mmmmmm... 
 - Should we? 
 - No!

 Get the f*ck outta here with that basic  Anne knowledge.

 - Honestly, Kate, who doesn't know that? 
 - Anne wanted to be a judge? 
 - I guess so. 
 Cheryl: And what about Alice? 
 Did you know that Anne read her diary,  and learned that she's been to second base?

 Which one is second base again?

 Did you know that quarantine was the most challenging  chapter of their marriage?

 Yeah.

 Safe flying.

 Pretty clear.
