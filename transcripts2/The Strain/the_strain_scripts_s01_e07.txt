 Previously on The Strain... 
 You've grown old, A230385. 
 It has been many years, you look exactly the same. 
 We're organizing you all for assignments to porters and johns. 
 Skills? 
 We are carpenters. 
 This scourge we're now witnessing has existed for millennia. Ravages what is human and instills a raging thirst. 
 Are you saying this epidemic was intentional? 
 That somebody planned this? Is  that what you are saying? 
 I don't know! They paid me a little bit of money to do 'em a favor, alright? Then the favors kept getting bigger an bigger. 
 And you waited now to tell us! 
 You might not understand this, Eph, but I would do anything to keep my wife alive. 
 No, Gusto! Gusto! Help! 
 What is that sh1t? Bro, get it out! 
 Those we hold dear, if they are turned, they come back home and destroy those they love the most. 
 Where are we going? 
 Mama needs some rest, so we are going on an adventure. 
 You're both ready. Good. I have a new plan. 
 (Valet): Would you like me to carry it for you, Mr. Luss? 
 No. There should be somebody here. 
 I got it. Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 (Car doors closing) 
 Communications companies across the country have been unable to avert the dramatic failure of cell phone and Internet communications, which began late yesterday. The fringe hacker group Citizens for Liberty claims responsibility for the slowdown which has paralyzed some of wall street's major financial institutions. The tragedy has already generated a class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday. 
 Attorney Joan Luss told reporters at a press conference that 173 of the Regis passenger families had joined in the legal action. Over 200 people were killed on that flight. (Cell phone ringing) Regis Air and the CEO bares... (Muted TV sound) Go, get 'em, girl. Neeva. Merci, bon Dieu, I reach you. 25 times I called you before I get through. You must come home. Your wife isn't well. There's something very wrong with her and she doesn't even know it. I... Whoa! Just slow down. What? I took the children. Took them where? My home. On my way from the airport. I'll be at the house in 20 minutes. Just bring the kids back there. No, I cannot. I've been on a plane for 19 hours. I'm not making  a side trip to yonkers tonight. They are already asleep. Fine. In the morning. First thing in the morning, bring them to the house. (Phone beeps) Call Joan Luss home. Cell service unavailable. Connect to the Internet. (Woman screaming) (Ambulance siren in the distance) (Mr. Luss sighs) Neighborhood's a little deserted. Any idea what's going on? They say it's from eclipse. How's that? $8.30. (Helicopter whirring) Credit machine not working tonight. Cash only. Got to run inside and get cash. I'll be right back. (Police siren) Oh! (Weird, low growling) Franco? What the!? Go, go, go! Just start the car! Go! Move! Drive! Lock the doors! Drive the car! What are you doing!? Drive the car! Jesus Christ! Drive the car! What is this, man?! Drive the goddamn car! Go! No, don't! Ah! Ah! Holy sh1t! What is this, man?! Go! Go! Oh! Oh, Jesus! (Talking in Croatian) What are you doing? (Driver speaking Croatian) (Gunshots) Ah! What the sh1t! (Gunshots) Ah! (Panting) Joan! (Roar) Joan, you got to call the cops! Joan, honey, where are you? Joan! Come on, come on. Oh! Oh, thank God! (Phone): Services have been suspended for this area. We value you as a customer and hope to reestablish service as soon as possible. This is a recording. Oh, my God! (Low growling) (Mr. Luss screaming) (Theme music) Authorities just announced the Brooklyn Bridge has been closed... Silver bullets? They are susceptible to silver, it burns them. I cast these bullets myself. OK. I learned the legend of this creature from my Bubbeh, my grandmother, when I was 8 years old. She's the one who told me silver could harm them. I have since verified this many times. Silver is known to interfere with sulfur bonds in bacteria. I suggest you fill up a gun. Look, before we do any more killing, and especially because I think it's clear we can't stop this thing one by one, I've got a better idea. We've got video. We've got ample proof to show people. Let's get this in front of the public, let' s get it in front of everybody. That will not work. Whoever is behind this has eliminated that option with much calculation and to great expense. Oh, but your theory that you pitched yesterday, that we kill the leader of these vampires, that's far more logical. It's far more likely to work. We kill the Master, and its spawn will die. I promise you. OK, for convenience sake and strictly as a semantic term, we'll refer to him as "the Master". You're saying we kill the master and that's somehow gonna stop this plague. Yeah. That makes no biological sense! You destroy one creature, and somehow all the other ones die? How does that work? I have verified the observations of these authors with my own experience. Those that are inaccurate, I have discarded. That is your scientific method, no? If you wish to defeat this evil, you must trust me. I understand this! You do not! (Man on TV): Aliens have infiltrated the highest levels  of our government... (Woman): Thanks, Howard. At every turn, everything I have said has proven to be correct. Is that not true? Yes, but... This is no different. Logic is not the issue here... It's your desire to always be in control. Alright, alright, if we were to do this, ho... how do we find this Master? Well, that is our first problem. His nesting place will be well hidden. We need to locate his human helpers. What about Jim? Those people hired Jim to smuggle the coffin out of the airport. Jim? Who's Jim? He's the guy who betrayed me. I'm not going back there. We're running out of other options. Please, Ephrem, trust me. We will prevail. (People talking in German) (Knocking) Achtung! In line! Now! (Dog barking) (Sighing) Gentlemen... while you have been contributing so diligently to the war effort, we conducted an inspection of your barracks and made a surprising discovery. A Jewish talisman. I believe you people refer to it as the Hand of Miriam. We found it secured beneath one of your bunks. It appears to have been carved from the very oak you work with in this shop. Oak that is property of the Third Reich. Now, who is responsible for this fine piece of craftsmanship? No one wishes to claim credit? Very well. (Man speaking Hebrew) I will shoot you one at a time until the perpetrator steps forward. I made it. Where did you learn to carve like this? My father. Show me your hands. Yes. "A230385." Please... come with me. If I recall correctly, this totem is named after the sister of Moses and Aaron and is supposed to offer protection from evil. (Dog barking) I have a special project for you. (Man speaking German) Lots of detail work. That shouldn't be difficult for you. You're excused from regular duties. This will be your sole focus. (Policeman): Any contraband between your toes? Let me see. Wiggle 'em for me. You know what I'm saying, bro? I'm not your bro. It was self-defense! Other foot, please. Up! Toes. You see that fat dude's body? Do I look like a coroner to you? Arms up. He had a 6-foot frog tongue! He bled white! He had worms in his blood! Sir, you need to chill out. Get the light out of my face, man. In a couple of hours, you'll come down off of whatever sh1t you took, but in the meantime, you need to follow my instructions. Now bend forward and expose your buttocks. I didn't take nothing. I don't do drugs. You better tell your bosses there's some weird sh1t going down out there. This is New York City, weird sh1t goes down out there all the time. What did I forget? Your phone charger. Alright, well, we better get going. Our flight doesn't leave for 4 hours. Yeah, well, with everything that's going on, traffic is going to be a nightmare. Something wrong? You tell me. You can't sit still. You keep looking out the window. Don't want to miss the flight. Why? You say this is the most deadly outbreak ever and suddenly you want to run off to Palo Alto with me? That's not you. This is different. This is about your health. It's about us. I know when you're lying to me, you always fiddle with your glasses. Could we just talk about this when we get there? No. We're talking now. Why did Barnes sideline you? He sidelined all of us. He doesn't want to acknowledge what's going on. Eph... No, it's... You helped him do whatever got him into trouble. It's not Eph's fault. It's me. I don't understand. I know. (Knocking on door) Jim, it's Eph! I thought the FBI had you. It did. Let us in. Sylvia, please. Let them though. What don't you understand, Sylvia? Your husband accepted bribes and because of that, an epidemic is now tearing its way through the city. Sylvie... I was involved in a major way. Look... No, you're not actually thinking of doing this. (Helicopter whirring) I cannot believe that you are gonna let this self-righteous prick manipulate you with crazy talk about vampires! No, I... I saw one. It attacked me. I'm not listening to any more of this. You need to decide what you're going to do... and who matters to you. I have to help them. (Sylvia sighs) I will get him. Great. Where are you going? To call a cab. I'm leaving! You do what you want, I will too! Jim, I need you to describe the German. He was about 45, blond, hair graying, maybe a toupee. Really waxy skin. And his eyes were intense. He was well dressed. Thomas Eichhorst. Give me a minute. Let him talk to her. What's your history with this German? It's long... complicated. He's a strigoi. When I first met him many years ago, he was still human, yet... Just as monstrous. A230385. (Muffled gunshots outside) (Dog barking) (Artillery fire) (Unlocking door) How is it progressing? Very well, Herr Standartenführer. (Men talking in German) (Dog barking) Your father taught you well. Does it bring you enjoyment? It takes my mind off this place. In that sense I suppose, it's... Pleasurable. (Gunshots outside) I've never been good with my hands. Cannot draw or sculpt or carve anything. Want to know how pathetic I am? In middle-school woodworking, I had to steal another boy's project to pass the class. How sad is that? We all have different talents. (Muffled explosion) I'm sure you did not rise to your... Position through sheer luck. (Artillery fire outside) (Men speaking German) Quite right. Managing people, that's my talent. Picking the right person for the right job. Just as I did with you on this project. And God, I was right. Look at that craftsmanship. (Distant explosion) (Man speaking German) (Dog barking) (Closing and locking door) Wish I had more like you. (Men speaking German) (Gunshots outside) (Ambulance siren) Bonjour, Audrey. Sleep well? No. Neeva, can we please go home? (Door closing) Good question, mom. You told her father you'd have them back by now. Go get your brother and we talk about it. What do you mean, "talk about it"? Christ, mother, you are their employee, not part of their family. There is danger in that house. Audrey, Keene, get your coats on. No, you can't! Don't argue with me about it. We're taking them back. OK. But if it is as I say, if she is sick, we will take the children away from there. I'm a nurse, mom, if Mrs. Luss is sick, I'll know what to do. Kids, get your coats on. Vite, s'il vous plait. (Siren blaring and cars honking) Dr. Moise said one of the side effects of corticosteroids is weight gain. In your case, that could be a good thing. You haven't a comment on the elephant in the room? What happens if his drug cocktail fails and my body rejects the liver? Sir, I don't think it's productive for you to think about that. In a few days, I'm sure we'll look back on this as a small bump in the road to your recovery. I am most gratified to hear that. We're all terribly fond of Eldritch. Oh, Eichhorst, I'm not aware that we're on a first name basis. I'll be right outside. Your manservant has developed misgivings about the relationship. He's a keen judge of character and very protective. Understandably. He's been with me since his birth. His parents worked for my mother and father. It's disappointing that it's no longer a common practice. I assumed you've informed your Master that the plan I've constructed is unfolding perfectly. Everyone is focused on the Citizen for Liberty cyber attacks. And only a small wrinkle: I've just received a disturbing voice-mail. This is Jim Kent. Look, I didn't destroy Redfern's body. I want you to have the German bring $100,000 cash I get the money, you get Redfern's body. And I'm never to be heard from again. You assured me that you had this fellow under control. It's a bluff. Kent would never have the courage to try this on his own. The Jew is behind it. I thought you were going to deal with him. He has more tenacity than I thought. Well... I hope it won't be a problem. No problem. I'll take care of it. Wunderbar. 
 
 (Indistinct talking) (Buzzing) Felix! (Gus speaking Spanish) (Man coughing) Make room. Alright? (Felix panting) I got you, let's go. (Felix groaning) I got you. It's alright. Yo, make room! First come, first serve. Put him back on the floor where he belongs. Get your bitch ass off the bench! (Men whispering) Relax, alright? Real easy. We're being punished for what we did. Stop talking crazy, man. Rest easy, OK? I'm gonna get us some help. We're gonna get out of this, huh? Just relax. You're gonna be alright. Yo, C.O.! C.O.! My friend needs some help, man. He's sick. A paramedic will come see him. When? When?! When he has time. Now, shut up or you'll be needing him too. (Buzzing) (Dog barking) Look, Sylvia, I'm... No, don't bother. Look, I'm sorry I lied. Alright? I was only trying to protect you. Jesus. Let's go. Goddamnit! (Sigh) She'll come around. Will she? Look, I'm all in with you guys. Let's hope this works and the German guy shows up. He has too much hubris. Once challenged, he will show. You'll need this. I was sort of hoping for something in the gun family. Silver is more effective. (Man shouting in German) (Gun shooting and artillery fire outside) (Dog barking) (Explosion) (Man shouting in German) (Man speaking German) (Explosion) (Unlocking the door) You must pick up the pace, A230385. I'm assuming the urgency is from that Russian artillery? It will get finished. I admire your work ethic. Where I grew up, everyone worked hard. We knew no other way. Where do you come from? I was born in Armenia. Uh. After the great war, my family settled in a little town in Romania. Varsolt. Varsolt. Of course! I travelled through there! Summer... '41! Has a beautifully preserved Roman castle. Oh. Went through the hands of many great empires: The romans... (Pissing in sink) Mongols, Habsburgs, the Germans. (Two louder explosions) So, tell me, A230385... Do you think we Germans will outlast our predecessors? (Man shouting in German) (Gunshots and artillery fire) Please. Speak freely. Ha! Ha! I think the Third Reich is in its death throes. Very likely. But suppose... A new Reich rose from the ashes of this one led by a new führer, who's able to deliver everything Hitler promised and more. I think that would be a very sad day for humanity. Quite the opposite, my friend. It's what humanity craves: a strong leader, a visionary... Visionary? Hitler is a megalomaniac who declared himself dictator. Wrong! Hitler was elected democratically! (Explosion) He went before the Reichstag. He asked the elected representatives of the people to grant him extraordinary powers! And they did by an overwhelming majority! Because they were terrified. Yes! Terrified of democracy! They had lived through the chaos of the Weimar Republic: governments gridlocked by parties and bickering! They realized Plato was right. The republic can only be led by a philosopher king with the wisdom to look after the needs of the many. (Gunshots outside) Unless you are a Jew. Ah... You see? This is the problem. You take all of this too personally. After the murder of my family, I suppose I do. Oh, the nobility of the victim! I see. (Explosion) You comfort yourself with the fantasy that you're morally superior to me, but you're not. First day you arrived, I asked if anyone was a carpenter, and you eagerly threw up your hands! And from that day on, you've labored here, working on behalf of the Third Reich! I had no choice! Yes, you have! But you're afraid of the choice. The alternative. (Explosion) (Dog barking) Here. Let me make it clearer to you. (He cocks the pistol) If you're quick enough, you might grab my pistol. You're going to die anyway when the trains stop. Why not go down fighting? Right here, right now? Don't you want to try? (Laughing) It's much easier to do nothing, isn't it? Safer. (Distant gunfire) If that God you believe in really existed, what do you suppose he would think of you? See? Look. I told you, something evil happened here. Call the police. No! No! Keene, no, no! Wait! Come back here! No! Oh! Wait! Come back! Keene! Audrey! Haš, enfants! Mommy, where are you? Mama, are you home? Disgusting. Mr. Luss? Miss Joan! Someone's been sick. Audrey! Miss Joan? (Audrey screaming) You, stay there! (Shrieking) Mr. Luss. Daddy! No! (Mr. Luss gasping weirdly) Sebastiane, we have to leave. We can't. We've got to take this man to a hospital. No! We must go now! (Low growling) Oh, God! Mama? What is that thing?! C'est pas le temps! La sortie est la ! Sortez! Sortez! Sortez! (Audrey): Neeva! (Creature screaming) (Growling) (Neeva): Ah! Ah! Ah! Allez! Allez, allez! (Audrey screams.) What is it? Open the door! Neeva! Neeva! Neeva! (Neeva screaming) (Sebastiane): Vite! Vite! Non! Non! Enfin! Par là! Go quick! Help me with the table! What's wrong with my momma? An evil loa has possessed her. He craves food. (Screaming) What food? (Creature roaring) Ah! (Indistinct PA system message) (General hubbub) Right upstairs. (Indistinct talking) (Man): I'll call you when I get there. No luggage, Mr. Kent? And no Sylvia. Won't she be joining you on your train? Where's the money? Where's the Jew? (Man coughing) What Jew? He's here somewhere. I can smell him. And he's managed to recruit you into his pathetic crusade. You're now on the wrong side of history, Jim Kent. It's not too late. You and your wife could still be part of a glorious new order. But make the wrong decision here and you condemn Sylvia to a painful and lingering death. (Indistinct PA system message) I'll ask you one more time. Where's the Jew? Christ, I have no idea. (Train station sounds cut out) I could drink you right here. (Jim panting) Turn you... If you do anything... You see those cops over there? They'll be all over you. (The ambient sounds of the train station return) Well... Then I guess you've made your decision. Consider your wife dead. (Woman on PA): This is Grand Central 47th Street. Transfer to Bedford, 6-7 at Charlotte to Times Square. Connection is available at Bedford. This is an east-transfer-bound 
5 expressway. Next stop is 51st Street. (Man on PA): Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the unavoidable delay. Eph! sh1t! He lost us. (Clanking) Jim. Did you see where Eichhorst went? No. Look, he knows it's a trap. He's looking for Setrakian. Did you warn him? I didn't see him. Alright, we have to find Setrakian. Come on! (Nora): I saw him on the first level. (Man on PA):Train service between 74th Street-Broadway, and 11th Street-Roosevelt Avenue  has been reduced due to construction. We apologize for the inconvenience this causes. For further information, the information desk... (Subway train brakes screeching) (People talking) (Hubbub) (PA): Ladies and gentlemen, (Kids coughing) (Baby crying) (Coughing) (Train operator): Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Stand clear of the closing doors. (Man on PA): Attention, passengers, the last stop for Pelham Bay Park is 3rd Avenue-138 Street. (Unsheathing a blade) A230385, you really thought I would lead you to him? I warned you to stay in jail. (Setrakian gasping) Fitting that we should end our journey where it began... On a train platform. This time, I'm the one with the weapon. Sardu's sword, the Master will be pleased to get it back. Then come and take it. And once again, you follow a false messiah who will prove as horrific as the last one. (Setrakian grunting) (Gunshot) (Setrakian gasping) Grrr! I give you another day of life, Jew, for services rendered. (Jim): Are you alright? (Man on PA): Seven train service has been reduced between 74th Street-Broadway and Queensboro Plaza. We have a new cook. Makes his own wurst. It's quite tasty. Go on, take it. You earned it. (Man talking German outside) You've included every detail. It's magnificent. They're back. Benedicta tu in mulieribus. Tu in mulieribus. Benedicta fructus ventris. Oh, papa! (Neeva speaking Latin) (Screaming) (Neeva speaking creole) Bon Dieu, protégez-nous. (Low growling) Mama. Come to me. Did they injure you? Non... no. Good. (Siren in the distance) Bring the young ones to me. Come over here. I want to have a look at you... Make sure you're OK. Did they, uh, scare you? Huh? I bet they did. Good. You look OK. Come here. How about you? Did they, uh, hurt you? No? Well, that's a good thing to know, huh? Ah... And how about you? It's just a Nick. I'll be OK. Oh. May I see? Hmm... Yeah, good. Good. Take the children. Go. (Softly): Come. Go. No! Wait a moment. Wait. (Screaming) No! Be quiet. Do not touch her.
