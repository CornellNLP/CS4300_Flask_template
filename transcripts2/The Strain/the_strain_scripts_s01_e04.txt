 Previously on The Strain. 
 206 passengers are dead Seal off the perimeter of the airport. Got it. I said let him through. I made a deal with Greg to provide some information and let a piece of medical cargo through customs. That's it. Here is the rest of the money Greg promised you in return. Tell him that one of the survivors is very sick. Tell him we need to corral the rest of the survivors and anybody they've had contact with. Now! Do you have a complete passenger manifest with you? Not right here. Why? Because you need to find every last passenger and destroy the bodies and anyone in contact with them. This is Gary Arnot. Thank you for sending my little girl home to me. Are you saying someone released her body to you? No, not her body.. Emma's alive. She showed up on my doorstep this morning. (screaming) We need to get him into surgery, find out what's happening inside him right now. Your patient... he's gone. OK I found him. Doyle, what are you doing? Get away from me. Agh! Oh my God. What just happened here? You didn't have a choice. Did you hear him say my name? What? No. He didn't say anything. Wish he had. The old man said destroy the head and burn the body. Should we be doing that? What are you saying? Are we burning corpses, now? OK, we have to cut him open before the whole hospital gets down here. Cut him open? We're all going to get arrested. It was self-defense. No one's getting arrested. L... let's move him. We have to find a place to do this. We gotta call this in. This is way over our heads. I just killed this thing, I need to explain why I did that, Jim. I'll go find a room. Help me move him. Well I just want to go on record I do not think that this is a good idea. A monster just tried to murder us. There are no records. (theme music) OK, we need a surgical kit, specimen jars, and rubber bands to seal the gloves. Jim, stay with the body. What if it gets up? Run. Funny. You run. But it's not gonna get up, right? Do you think Redfern knew what was happening to him? I hope not. Hey, if you need time, I can do this on my own. No. I want to be there. Find some answers. Make his death mean something. Good, 'cause I need you. Ansel? I'm taking the kids to your sister's. Unless... you think I shouldn't. No. Take them. Get them out of here as soon as you can. Daddy's not feeling well. Just go with Mommy, OK? (Gertie whimpering) Please, let me call Dr. Barrett. He knows our family, he's not like these government people he cares about you. No. I'm going to rest. I'll be fine. Go and wait by the door, please. Go on. Is there anything I can do for you? No, Annie. Just take care of the kids, OK? Tell them I'm sorry for being so grumpy, eh? I'll put Gertie in the shed, get her out of your way. No. No, leave her. She can keep me company. Cuz, where's my clock? Shut up. Ha! Ha! Gusto! What up? What up, bro? Smells good in here, man. I've gotta fatten you up, ése. I'm hungry. Chupo's got you all manorexic. He! He! He! Everybody can't be pretty like you, brah. That's just the start though. Yeah? I hear good things. Thank you, man. Cash flow things. Keep it down, bro. There's this dude in Queens, Alonso Creem. Mmhm. He buys cars. Hear he pays up to a g a pop. Him and these Nigerians. This is a sure thing, homie. For real? Yeah. 'Cause a sure thing got me locked up last time. I got the sweet rolls you like. I stopped off at the bakery. Thank you. You know how I love this nino? Uh huh. Everyday he call me or came while you were away. - I know. Tan lindo, tan lindo mi Felix. Andele. He bring me groceries. Yeah. Stolen from my Pop's shop. Don't joke. I'm not joking. No, no, no. Too much. I have to watch my weight. Thank you, mama. DE nada, mi hijo. I love you. I love you, too. Ah. Herr Eichorst. Herr Palmer. Mr. Fitzwilliam, now that Mr. Eichorst is here, will you show in our guest? So. Dutch Velders. A self-described internet freedom fighter. Claims he can do all we need. Eccentric, but comes highly recommended. Dutch Velders, Mr. Palmer. Hello, Miss Velders. Sorry, nobody said you were a woman. I get that a lot. After the Regis Air catastrophe, the stock markets plummeted. Then, as we all know, the CEO of Regis Air killed himself. Now, the online community is up in arms about corporate greed and corruption all those people on that plane dying, the stock market crash and the possibility of the suspension of the nation's air travel... The online group, Citizens for Liberty, is planning a massive hacking campaign to crash the websites of New York City's largest corporations. Is that believable, Ms. Velders? Heh! Anything's possible if it's motivated by enough hatred, Mr. Palmer. But it's gotta be someone really smart, to figure out how to drown servers. Takes time and patience. But the story is the group came to me. I'm the only one who could slow the internet down to worse than dial-up. If there is someone else can, I taught them. She wants credit for it. And, I also want money. Must be so slow that sending photos or instant anything is impossible. Sure. It's much harder to hide evil sh1t these days, isn't it? Are we doing this? Yes, you're hired. Thank you for coming in. Jim, record video. Use my phone, but be careful. Don't get near the blood. There's not a chance of that happening. What happened to the worms? I don't know but look at this. These folds, they seem functional. Vestibular folds. If the body temperature rose a lot of heat would be released through there. His uh, genitals are... gone. Uh, his excreting organs have fused into a cloaca. Do I even want to know? Uh, reptiles, birds other lower animals... their urine and feces are all expelled through the same opening. Oh, that's adorable. It's efficient. Let's open him up. Jim, get closer. Film this. Lungs have dried up. Label that. Label it as what? Uh, the... heart is all shriveled up. The arteries are necrotic but... these tubular structures appear healthy. It's a new circulatory system. It's... brand-new flesh, but it's symmetrical. It's not random or cancerous. This is a plaque cartilage. A whole new set of organs has generated to propel this stinger. Ugh - is that the technical term for it, is it? Stinger? I feel like I'm choking just looking at it. Oh god. Christ! What is that smell? Ammonia discharge. Like guano. Same as on the plane. And Bishop's body. That's enough. (panting) This is disgusting. Just... just call it in, Eph, goddamit, just call it in! Jim... No, this thing just shot a six foot python out of its mouth, its dick is gone and it... it just squirted a shitload of sh1t all over the table and you've got your hands everywhere. I mean, God. What the hell is going on?! It's a parasitic mechanism. This is rewriting human biology. Why? Why is it doing that? So it can reproduce. And consume its host. Hi Mr. Farrell. I'm gettin' a little tired comin' up here, Gadaloop. I'm sorry. You always sorry, but nothin' changes. How many times do I have to tell you - don't leave recyclin' in the hallway. It's a fire hazard. Gus. Hey, there. Didn't know you were back in town. I thought we were squared up this month. No. Didn't get it... Did you take the rent down? Yes. I swear. 'Scuse me, mama. Please. OK. If I don't deliver rent checks on time, the owner beats my balls off Everybody works for somebody, right or wrong... We're not talking about the rent, now. Now we're talking about the way you speak to my mother Yeah, that's funny, huh? 'Cause if she ever tells me you talk to her like that again they're going to find your body in one of those recycling bins you love so much. Now here's the rent. And for next month. You need me, Mano? Yo. You forgot somethin'. Go green! (door closes) Now let's go meet that guy with the Nigerians. (cries of reporters) Ansel, I'm home! I made it! Ansel? I left this shirt out for you, honey. I thought... maybe you could get out of your pajamas today. Huh... did your daddy take you for a walk? That'd be nice. Everybody getting in some air today. Of whom shall I be afraid? No one. No one. I'm not afraid. (Sound of something inside the shed.) Ansel? Ansel, is that you? Are you alright? Honey, are you hiding from me? (Sounds of chains moving.) Why did you do that? Mother Mary walk with me. Ansel? Honey? What's happened to you? I wanna help you. Let me. Please. Raaaah! Run. Go away. Please, Annie! (Ansel growls.) Go! Don't come near me. Never come back. The voice in my head... is telling me to rip your throat and drink from you. I need you. Lock the door and run, Ann Marie. No matter what I say. Please, Annie! Go FAR AWAY! Ahhhh! I'm closed for the day. It's still morning. Thank you for that profound observation. Got something for you. Not today. Hm. I'm not in the business of buying my own property back. I'm returning it to you. Well, I imagine that's the only good news this day will bring. Well, you're welcome. Asshole. I coulda listened to that old man. Taken the cabinet. Destroyed it. Now it's gone. There's a disease spreading through the city. What now? Well, we get outta here and we... stop this thing. Somehow. Even if nobody'll help. How? I don't know. This is my fault. No, it isn't. No, Eph. It is. I waved that van through at the airport after you sealed it. I was paid to do it. The box was inside. What? I'm flat broke. What does that have to do with letting the box through? Go back. This guy named Gregg Nelson approached me at a medical convention. I mean he just wanted to sell the CDC some equipment, some ideas about government contracts. I mean, I think I was targeted. I'm... I'm sure. Who targeted you? They knew about my debt, alright? They knew about everything that Sylvia was going through. I don't know how, but they did. I mean, I owed a lot of money before she got sick. But after, with medical bills. You have insurance. Sylvia is dying. The cancer is everywhere. We ran every treatment they offered and then we kept going. We did anything that we thought made sense and the cost was insane. Are you saying this epidemic was intentional? That somebody planned this? Is that what you're saying? I don't know! I don't know. Alright? They paid me a little bit of money to do 'em a favour, alright? And then the favors kept getting bigger. And you waited 'til now to tell us?! They wanted me to clear a box from the airport. A box! It was soil. The readings were negative. It was just soil! I would never hurt anybody. Come on, you know me! We've been friends for 10 years all of us. Come on, please. Where did they take the coffin? I... I don't know. Who's behind all this? Some scary prick this... German guy. He threatened me. Come on. I'm on your team. You might not understand this Eph, but I would do anything to keep my wife alive... Go to your wife. 
 
 Call Barnes. Call the police. I don't care. Agh... You're dead to me. There was nothing I could do. No. Give me the phone. Nora, please. (Nora sighs) I don't know that guy back there. Think of how desperate he must have been to do something like... Please don't make excuses for him. Just trying to imagine if someone I was in love with was dying. What I'd be capable of doing. We need to find another victim. Setrakian said he knew where the bodies were going. Back to their loved ones. Emma Arnot. Her father. Jesus... We'll bring her to the hospital. Run some tests. Then we'll have video of both Redfern and her. (Engine whining) I'll never get used to this car. You know I traded my Rolex for it back... Yeah. I know. I know. (Chicano rap playing) Missed you, fool! Ha! Ha! Ha! (crying) I hope you didn't suffer. Ansel is sick. Something... is warping him. Inside. God only knows what he saw on that plane. God damn airplanes! Like missiles the way they rip through everything. I asked him. You heard me. But... sometimes you can't... speak about the things you see. Hello? Ann Marie? (growling from shed) Oh my God. Yeah, hi. Hi. Trip Taylor, from next door. Wow. Little winter gardening? What do you want, Mr. Taylor? OK, I am officially fed up with this noise. Either you let the dog out so she shuts up, or, I don't know, maybe train her to behave while she's locked in the shed. This isn't rocket science It's shameful to own a pet and not discipline it. Oh, and speaking of filthy animals, those press people parked out front used my mimosa tree as a piss post. Thank you very much for that. I don't think you're going to have to worry about the dog anymore. That's what your husband said the first time your mutt tore up my yard. What do you mean? She entered my property without permission. You hit my dog? I didn't say that. (roaring) OK. I'm calling the police. This is outrageous. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. If you want to go in there and teach her a few things... I don't have the heart for it. You're right about that. Good. Oh, God. Hey! Hey! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing? What the hell? Ahhh! No! No! Oh my God! (Loud crash and then silence.) (growling) Gentlemen, sorry to interrupt. Does this look like we open? Got something to sell. We hear you have a real nice showroom. Like to add to it. That so? It's out back. Look, now's not a good time, aight? Phones are down. Internet's not working, just... Yeah well we here now. I mean if we ain't good enough for you to do business with, then we out. Wait. It's a brand new Mercedes SUV. Let's see what you got. It's colder than a goblin's ass out here, huh? Ha! Ha! Do your thang, home boy. (speaking in African) What? (They continue speaking in African.) Still got a baby seat in the back. No extra charge for that. Ha! Ha! Ha! Here's 400. What's that? We heard you pay a thousand. 400. You gonna take it or not? Yeah. Nah. We got other stops to make. Get in. Get a word with you? I should beat your big ass. Why you always gotta bring up my ass, man? Leave my ass out of this. We're here, let's finish this. That ugly silver toothed punk could murk us for 400 lousy ass dollars right now. You got your ratchet on you? Always ready, homie. We leavin'. 800. Get a full g next time you come around. You can bet on that. Heh! Heh! Heh! Forgive me or waking you, sir. Your appointment's here. I'm not asleep. It actually hurts to keep my eyes open. Sorry. The delivery is right on time. Should be here soon. Most of the cell towers in the city are reporting problems. The top seven Internet server farms have crashed. All the social networks have gone dark. Mmhm? That girl is surprisingly reliable. Huh. Alright. Show Maggie in. Secretary Pierson, Mr. Palmer. Please forgive me, Maggie Eldritch. I know. Don't worry. I'll be better soon. Please. I had a phone call from the White House today, an urgent one. You need to understand what happened on that flight. They will never tell you, but I feel it's imperative you know. The United States military removed the bodies from the morgue. In the middle of the night. Why did they do that? A highly classified biological agent got loose on that airplane. It was a tragic mistake. Of epic proportions. But now we must do what needs to be done. Without cowardice. Without hesitation. Those poor people. What makes you powerful and formidable is also what makes a decision like this so painful - your decency. Maggie, we need you to put your country first. Not the bullshit country we pretend to be, the one we really are, the one you're getting to know very well. I saw that in you from the start - the potential to get the game behind the game. I owe you my career, Eldritch. Now what about the bio-agent? - Highly lethal, but it quickly dissipates; designed so our troops can follow it into battle. That's why no one found it. It's gone. Done. Will you stand with me on this, Maggie? Yes, I will. Whatever you need. Are you okay? I can't tell you how rare and valuable... What's going on? Where's Maggie? You passed out, sir. Once she was certain you were OK, Secretary Pierson left. Mr. Palmer. Your new liver is here, it's in great shape. We need to prep you for surgery right now. Does Eichorst know what is happening to me? We haven't been able to reach him, sir. Have they already forgotten how much they need me? Why are they doing this? I was promised a miracle. We have a healthy liver for you. That's the miracle. Eldritch, you are in fulminant hepatic failure. Yes, yes you have my consent. Get on with it. Excellent. Let's get him into surgery now. Hello? It's Ephraim Goodweather from the CDC. Mr. Arnot? (Children's music playing.) ♪This old man, he played two♪

Get out of the way! Sabia mea fredoneaza de argint. Are you OK? Are you OK? Keep away from the bodies. The worms, don't let them touch you. What have you done? Among other things, I just saved your life. We have resources, protocols. Not for this. There's no other way. I can't stay down here. There are two containers full of gasoline in the garage. We have to finish this. Burn them. (Nora crying.) Nora. Just... just, no. Don't. Just let me go. No, no, no. Please. Please. We're not doing this. We were talking about finding a cure. That was before we knew how quickly it spreads. We have to do this with him. It's our only shot. Oh, come on, Eph! We don't exterminate our patients when there's an outbreak. The Chinese culled the bird population in Hong Kong after the avian flu hit. It was the responsible thing to do. We're not hunting down human beings. They're hunting us! Where do you think that blood came from? Arnot was out there killing innocent people. Nora, please... That was a little girl in there. I mean, how old was Emma? Eight, tops? She was sick but... No. She was gone. There was something inside her shell. That was a body controlled by a virus. This is what we do. The people of New York rely on us to investigate and eliminate threats to their health. And now, when it finally means something, we're gonna run? I am not doing this. I'm not. I'd rather die from whatever this epidemic is than kill people! This, it's... not for everyone. Are you going to murder everyone on that list of yours? Yes. I assume you're not staying with us. No. Please be safe. Promise me. There has to be another way. Some brains... can't adjust. I can see you love her for that... But you have to let her go. Get the gasoline.
