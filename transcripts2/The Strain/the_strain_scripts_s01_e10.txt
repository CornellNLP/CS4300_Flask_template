 Previously on The Strain... 
 Dad, what's happening? 
 This is part of the epidemic we've been investigating Matt was infected. Now I need you to tell me: when was the last time you heard from your mother? 
 This morning. They were arguing about you because you told us to go to Vermont. Matt didn't come home last night. 
 Do you know who Eldritch Palmer is? 
 One of the most powerful men in the world, yes. 
 He hired me. 
 What did you do? 
 I worked my ass off to shut the Internet down. 
 We can get the Master. He's nesting. 
 Somewhere in the city. 
 But I need your help. 
 Where's Kelly? 
 Kelly's MIA all day. 
 Where's Zack, Eph? 
 He's with my colleagues. 
 It's not safe here. 
 Right, right. In all your concerned state, you still find time to screw on the rug? 
 She's serious. You have to get out of town as soon as possible. 
 You hurt my friend, I will cut your heart out. 
 I love my wife. She's the mother of my son. 
 I'd do anything to find her. 
 Yes! 
 Aw, crap. 
 (Beep! Beep! Beep!) 
 No, come on! Please! Work! 
 Yes! 
 Dad! Dad, come here! 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 Mom's phone, it moved. 
 She's moving. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I lost my phone a couple months ago. 
 I used this website to track it. 
 So I thought, you know, maybe we could use it on her. 
 You got online? 
 Barely. It's super slow, but I finally got enough of a signal. 
 It's going in and out but I got enough to see the phone move. 
 (Beep! Beep!) 
 You're sure it's moving? 
 Yeah. Like 3 blocks. 
 If she's moving, she's gotta be OK, right? 
 It's a good sign. 
 I'm going to call her. 
 (Dialing) 
 Dad, it's ringing. 
 (Aswering machine): Hi, it's Kelly. Leave me a message and I'll call you right back. Thanks. 
 (Beep) Mom, it's me again. Call me back, OK? Please? Maybe it's on silent or something. Why hasn't she called back? What was the location? This says... Main and Front. No! Come on, please! Work! Shh, shh. It's OK. It's OK. We know her location. I'll get her. (Theme music) (Radio): The President has declared a bank holiday in an attempt to stabilize the nation's teetering financial system.  Hey. This latest move comes Hey. in the wake of 23 bank failures yesterday. Despite these measures, the head of the International Monetary Fund hinted in a news conference today that the world financial system is now teetering on the brink of systematic...  What's going on? Zack tracked down Kelly's phone. Good morning, Mrs. Martinez. The phone is moving. Where is it? Astoria. Don't say it. I wasn't gonna. Kelly could be alive. The phone is moving during daylight. She could've gotten out without getting stung. We did. They're mobilizing downstairs. Setrakian has a plan. I have to do this first. I didn't mean to hurt you last night. Nothing makes any sense anymore. I don't know what I'm saying, what I'm doing, but I knew what I was doing... then. I'm not sorry about that. I know you tried to prepare me for the worst but I think there's a real chance here, and so long as there is... (Setrakian): Then you should go. But you must be prepared for what you might find. I get it. Take your weapons. Any change? Still in the same place. Can't I come? I don't want to just sit here. No, I need you to track the phone. Text me if the signal moves. What if it doesn't go through? Keep texting. Bring Mom back with you. I tracked the epicenter of the rat-free zone  right down here by the World Trade Centre. I popped down into the tunnels to investigate, ended up eye-to-eye with a few dozen of them. It was a fun day. In my opinion, attacking them head-on on their own turf seems like a good way for us all to die. The thing about rats is they always have a backdoor... That's why it's so tricky to catch them. I bet that the vamps... I bet you they have one, too. So this is my thinking, alright? We have to look at all the decommissioned tunnels and lines near the World Trade Centre. Which this map... Doesn't help us very much. It'd be great to get online. I know this great transit archive on there. The Internet's for sh1t, so... Yeah, sorry about for that. About what? I brought it down. Uh... I think I missed that. Yeah, not just me, but... my crew. An old rich guy hired us to interrupt mobile services and... crash most Internet traffic. Eldritch Palmer. Preventing the spread of information. And you helped him?! I never wanted to hurt people. I have been trying to figure out a way to make things right. Can you do that? Maybe. If I can get back into Palmer's offices. How would you get access? I could get her in. Use my city credentials. Fly under the radar. Sure, I could be your boss. Assistant. Boss. Details. I always wanted to get into that building. (Man): Keep up, let's go! (Glass shatters) (Screams) (Man): Hey baby, the world about to end. You want... Hey, where'd you get that phone? That's mine. That's my phone. I know you stole it. Where's the woman you took it from? Where'd you find it?! Back off or I'm not telling you sh1t. I found this on the street. Wasn't any woman with it. You're gonna show me where... Show me your badge po-po. Do I look like a cop? I'm a doctor. For real? It's infected. Jesus Christ that's a bad burn. How long have you had that? Got it last week. OK, brea. Where did you find the phone? Help me up. Agh. Thank you. There. It was right there. Did you see the woman driving? No. (Growling) (Quiet growling) (Faucet running) (Knock! Knock! Knock!) Matt? Matt?! (Running water) (Sighs) You know not talking is part of what ended my marriage. (Matt whimpers) God! Way to be a grownup! Look, if you don't want to talk, at least let me in. I need to get ready for work. (Faucet running) (Kid): She's so mean. Hey, you're here. It's a school day, right? Yeah, but like half the kids are out. Most of the staff, too. Are they sick? I guess. A bunch of them didn't even bother to call in. Miranda is going to release the kids early. No point with barely half attendance. What? Do you know something? Eph warned me about a virus. Something to do with that plane at JFK. Said we should leave town. Seriously? Oh, God. If you want to let Miranda know. But I'm getting Zack and I'm getting out of town. You should, too. Matt? Where are you? Called a half day at school. Everyone is sick. Eph was right. Matt? (Sighs) Enough already! Did you hear me? Eph was right. And you had him arrested by the FBI... Oh, my God, Matt? Ah! Ah! Gah! Gah!!! Ah! Gah! Ah! Rah! (Strigoi screams) (Sizzling) Gah. Ah... Gah! (Crying) (Gasps) (Coughing) (Gasping for air) Bleh! (Radio on) Zack? Sweetheart, where are you? (Radio): An equal number of people who intend, it seems to be, to take matters into their own hands. Firearm sales have spiked... survival equipment, propane tanks, generators, canned food and the likes... (Knock! Knock! Knock!) Kelly? Oh my word. Are you OK? Where's Zack? I'm here to pick him up. Am I late? I... I think I'm late. We dismissed early and when we couldn't reach you, your friend Diane came to pick him up, I mean... I know that you carpool. Look, Kelly... I think maybe you've been in an accident and we should get you to a hospital. Can you get Zack for me? Please? Mm-hmm. I uh... If you'll just excuse me, I'm just going to make one call. OK? I'll be right back. (Whimpering in pain) I'm guessing that she's been in a car accident and I think that she has a concussion. (Click!) Hello? (Master): Kelly... (Growling) (Thumping) (Growling) (Man): Agh! (Roaring) Back off! Agh! Ah! (Eating sounds) Ah! Agh! Argh! 
 
 ♪ Walking on the world ♪ OK, assistant. You believe you're supposed to be there, they'll believe it. Sure. You know this isn't my first dance, O wise and powerful. So what's with the old pawn shop guy? How are you friends with him? Met him last night. Same as you. Really? Huh. Seemed to have such a shorthand. What about you? What's your story? No story. What you see is what you get. Listen, honey. The pawn shop guy is a vampire killer. If you could top that story with your mysterious background, then... go for it. Fine. What do you want to know about me? This guy Palmer. Guy dicks you over to bring about end times? If we're going to his building just to borrow his Wi-Fi then you're wasting my time. I wouldn't dream of wasting your time. Hello. Uh, New York Pest Control Services. We have to inspect your executive dining facilities. I don't have you down here. Hmm. Well they don't let us make appointments for inspections, you know? I can't let you through without an OK from security. You're sure about that? It's pretty much just a quick look-see. You know, another box I have to check off for my hard-ass boss. In and out in 10? Hm? Well, it looks like executive dining is in between shifts anyway. So... Oh, perfect. Middle elevator, 25th floor. Thanks Lauren. You're the best. And you have yourself a great day, OK? OK. Thanks. Confidence. It's all about confidence. Will you follow us, please? Confidence or competence? Now look, I don't want to get you boys in trouble. But as Pest Inspectors for the City of New York, we have the absolute right to enter any licenced food... Hey. Shut up. Alright. Thank you. Ms. Valders. Reggie Fitzwilliam, you remember me? 'Cause I certainly remember you. I see you've taken up rat catching. So it appears. Search them. Don't touch me. Use these for catching rats? Only really big ones. So what now? Mr. Palmer would like to see you. No, not you. Her. Alone. (Growling) (Glass shattering) (Car alarm) Kelly? (Pots and pans rattle) You here? We're live at the scene of another of what may be a series of bizarre murders. This tragic incident claimed the lives of a young married couple here in Brooklyn tonight. They were found in the basement of their home after a neighbour complained of a terrible smell emanating from inside. Police sources say a disturbing pattern of random violence has swept across New York City (Lock clicks) in recent days. Police have been inundated with reports of home invasions and attacks... (Helicopters whirring) Oh my God! Oh my God, Kel! You scared the crap out of me. What time is it? Kel? (Whimpering) Kelly? Matt did this? Are you serious? (Weakly): Where's Zack...? What... What do you mean where's Zack? Eph said Zack was with him. Kel, honey, you know what? You're freaking me out, OK? So I'm going to take you to the Emergency Room, OK? Mom? What's... What's going on? Ah! Ah! Kelly! What the... Ah! What the hell are you doing?! What the hell are you doing?! No! Ah! Ah! H... oh... (Quiet growling) OK. Why in God's name would you ever come back here? Because I don't like being taken for a ride. Now I know that Palmer's behind all this. Evidently you're fine with being his lackey. I am not. Mr. Palmer is very ill. I won't let you harm him. If you try anything, anything at all, I'll kill you. Am I clear? Ms. Valders. As requested. Ah, Ms. Valders. I so admire your pluck. Thinking you and who? A rat catcher? Could come here and... what? Dispense with me? The mind boggles at the absurdity of the plan. But the ego behind it... audacious. You lied to me. Did we have a deeper transaction than I recall? I bought you. You let me. Are you a vampire, too? Hardly. You wanted to bring the world down. Wipe out the human race. Why would any rational person want to do such a thing? First, don't deny yourself due credit. You should be taking a bow. You did exceptional work. Truly. I couldn't have done this without you. Human DNA decays as we age. Overtime, it frays and it fails and we follow suit. But, it's a code that can be rewritten. Rewrite the software and you control the hardware. The meat, muscle, and tissue that is mankind. To what end? If hacking is about exploring the limits of what is possible, then I am on the verge of achieving what you would consider the ultimate hack. Cheating death. Immortality? Yes. Well thanks for sharing. It's hard to be on the verge of something so exciting and not share the good news with someone and you are the perfect person. And how's that? Well, who would listen to you if you shared it? You are insignificant. You feel how invisible you are. That's why you did what you did for me. Am I right about that? Son of a bitch! You... you asshole! Let go of me! You're the nothing. You. We won't see her again. Get off me. No, sir. You will not. Get off me! (Master): Kelly... (Sniffing) (Sound of heartbeat) (Growling) Kelly... Come to me... Come to me... (Angry growling) Come to me, Kelly. (Snarling) Kelly. Come to me! Look at me! Rejoice! (Growling loudly) Embrace your glorious fate. Hey, Mr. Charming, remind me to ignore you next time. Sure, next time I will. We'll do it your way. We'll shout, yell, shoot our way in. Yeah, well I had a better chance. Stop. Turn around. Relax. I'm letting you go. My employer is... misguided. Misguided is not the bloody word I would use. I don't agree with what he's doing, so I can hardly carry out an order to kill the people who are trying to make it right. Won't your friends here tell on you? Their loyalty is to me. Then why don't you all join us? Help us make this right. Go. While you have a chance. Go. Diane? (Sinister music) (Growling) (Bang!) (Roaring) (Bang!) (Quiet growling) (Sad music) (Roars) (Bang!) (Crying) (Sobbing) (Nora): The only way to ensure we're right is go down there. It's night. I was worried. Nothing. Guess we're not the only ones that struck out, huh? No luck with the wife, huh? Oh, you're still here? Who invited you here, exactly? Hey! She's here just the rest of us. Who put you in charge? The director of the Centres for Disease Control put me in charge. You know what? I don't need this sh1t. If you don't want me, that's absolutely no problem. I am gone. Hey, hey, hey. It's not his decision. Alright? Just ignore him. He doesn't speak for all of us. It's too dangerous. At least just wait 'til morning. I would rather take my chances out there than be stuck in here with you assholes. Great. You got a better deal out there, be my guest. (Footsteps) Dad? Hey, buddy. Did you find Mom? Dr. Goodweather, Nora and I were just about to go over what we discovered... Just a minute. You... didn't find her? No. Look, I uh... I did find her phone. I guess she lost it. What does that mean? I'm not giving up, Zack. Maybe this is why she hasn't called. 1230. I know it. It was the street address at our place in Philly when I was at medical school. First place we bought together. Keep going! (Laughter) Keep going. Keep going! Come on! Ha! Ha! Ha! It's what you wanted, right? Mom, seriously? Back deck. What? Check the back deck. Surprise! Do you like it? I love it! I got you good, didn't I? Yeah. Happy birthday, Z. Thanks so much. You're the best mom, ever! I love the blue. It's exactly what I wanted...
