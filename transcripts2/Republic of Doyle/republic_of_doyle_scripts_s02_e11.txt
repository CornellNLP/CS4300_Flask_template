 [Narrator] Previously, on Republic of Doyle. 
 [Allison] Jake. Can we meet? 
 [Jake] I was starting to worry that maybe you lost my number. I know that you're always in my way-- [Des] Yeah? 
 [Jake] But you gotta know, you don't need to be like me. 
 [Tinny] Come on, Jake, he looks up to you. 
 [Christian] Stop treating me like I'm a broken brother. 
 [Rose] The world doesn't end while you're gone. 
 [Mal] I hate this crap. So decedent. 
 [Rose] It's okay to have fun once in a while! 
 [Mal] You're just like your mother! 
 [Bill] You know, I was just, uh, checking reference. 
 [Leslie] On Jake Doyle. 
 [Bill] Thinking of creating a task force. It's a changing city, and we need to make moves to protect her. 
 [Jake] So, how you doing? You okay? 
 [Leslie] I might have something that... 
 [Jake] What? So I guess I'll see you around? 
 [Leslie] Yeah. 
 ( laughing ) 
 [jake] Boys, thanks for dropping by, but I'm kinda working here. 
 [Walter] You know, I am familiar with the intricacies of the stake-out, Jake. Now hand me a beer. 
 [Christian] Is this really what you do all day? Follow cheating husbands? 
 [Jake] Sometimes, yes. I've been following this guy for months, I still don't have anything on tape yet. 
 [Walter] Ah, let's just hit George street, man. Girls like me better when they are drunk. 
 [Christian] Oh, well now. What's this? Ah, it's for the girlfriend. How sweet. 
 [Walter] Allison Jenkins. She's the hottest lawyer in town, guaranteed. Well, present company excluded, of course. 
 [Jake] Just give me that. 
 [Christian] Hey! 
 [Walter] Ooh! Sweet! Can I have this or what? 
 [Jake] Come on. 
 ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [jake] Come on. 
 [Walter] No! 
 [Christian] Oh, hi! Hot gal! 
 Hey, um, I've been thinking about upping those stakes in bed. What's that thing that you do to me I love so much? 
 ( laughing ) 
 [allison] Uhh, what? Jake? 
 [Jake] Hi, sorry about that. 
 That was my dickweed brother. 
 [Allison] You're still working? 
 [Jake] Uh, yeah. I might be here for a while. 
 [Allison] Well, if you get off at a decent hour and you'd feel like coming by, do, 'kay? 
 [Jake] Yeah, let's just see how this goes. 
 [Walter] Hey look hey, check me out, eh? Fancy wha? 
 [Jake] Give it to me or die! 
 [Allison] What? 
 [Jake] Sorry, that wasn't for you. Actually, I do have something for you, to be honest. 
 I'd like to give it to you later, maybe tonight or tomorrow. 
 [Allison] Okay. Bye. 
 [Jake] Okay, touch this again, and fingers get broke. 
 [Walter] All right! 
 [Christian] No one buys a gift like that unless they feel guilty about something. 
 [Walter] Eh, hey, whoa, whoa, wait! Is that you're cheating husband at 11 o'clock? 
 [Jake] All right, lads. Like I said, it's been swell. I've got work to do. 
 [Christian] Did he just use a special knock? 
 [Walter] Ah, special knock! You know what that means? Strippers! 
 [Jake] Okay, you can either stay here or you can go home, but I gotta go in there. 
 [Walter] I just wanna see some boob, man! 
 [Christian] Hey, I saw that special knock. 
 [Walter] Ha ha! 
 [Christian] Did you? 
 [Walter] He needs us! We're going in! Ah! Ow, man. All right! I got a good feeling about this! I think we're gonna see some boob. 
 [Christian] Wow, it's a buffet of high-powered lawyers and judges. 
 [Jake] Yeah, a little secret society kinda thing. Is this seat taken? Mr. Mayor. 
 [Bill] Jake. 
 [Jake] All the stars are out tonight, what? 
 [Bill] Just a bit a fun, that's all. 
 [Jake] Looks like you're running a little low on happiness there. 
 So, what's the buy in? 
 [Gunman] Nobody move! Hands on the table! Empty your pockets! 
 Wallets, watches. Now! 
 [Bill] Okay. 
 [Gunman] Money in the bag. 
 [Jake] Ow! What the hell, man? 
 [Gunman] Shut up and empty your pockets! 
 [Jake] I don't got anything in my pockets! 
 [Christian] Jake, don't be an idiot. 
 [Gunman] Put it all in the bag. 
 [Jake] Fine! 
 [Gunman] Everything. 
 [Jake] Ugh. 
 [Gunman] Everybody stay still. 
 Ladies. 
 [Walter] All right, this is what I'm talking about! 
 [Gunman] Shut up! 
 [gunman] Everybody gets their turn. 
 [Jake] Brother...

 [Christian] Come on, man. It's no big deal. It's just a necklace. What? 
 [Jake] Okay, it's your fault that I brought the friggin' necklace in there in the first place. 
 [Christian] Ha! My fault? Give me a break. 
 [Jake] Whatever. 
 [Christian] All right. I'll buy you a new one. Yeah, what'd it cost you? That much? 
 [Jake] What's all this? 
 [Mal] My back. It's killing me. 
 I threw it out last night. 
 [Christian] Oh. You need some painkillers? I know a guy, if you're lookin'. What? Come on, it's a joke! 
 [Mal] What's wrong with him? 
 [Christian] Broken heart. 
 Someone stole the necklace he got for his girlfriend. 
 [Jake] Someone, yeah, but just-- I need your help. 
 [Mal] I suppose I could-- 
 [Rose] No, you don't, Malachy Doyle. I told you, doctor's orders. Sorry guys, he's all mine today. 
 [Mal] If you need backup, get Christian to help ya. 
 [Jake] Oh, he's been enough help already, haven't ya? I'm good on my own, thanks. 
 Jake. Yeah, this'll be fun. 
 [Mal] Good. Now get out. The two o'ye. 
 [Jake] Just stop following me around! 
 [Christian] I'm not following you! 
 [Mal] Pretending I have a bad back is giving me a bad back. I don't feel totally right about lying. It's not my strong suit. 
 [Rose] You owe me, okay? I've been waiting months for a honeymoon that never comes. One day, that's all I ask. 
 [Mal] I know. It's fine. 
 [Rose] Besides, it'll give Jake and Christian some quality bonding time. 
 [Mal] If they don't kill each other in the process. 
 [Christian] You blame me for losing the big present? Let me help you get it back. 
 [Jake] Whatever, Christian. Just shut up, all right? 
 [Des] What present? You got a present? Is it for me? 
 [Christian] All right, so this judge and half the lawyers in town were at the poker game. 
 It's a who's who of high-powered degenerates. 
 [Jake] The masked gunman, right? 
 He snaps a bunch of pictures, so if you try to turn him in, your picture ends up in the front page of the paper. 
 [Christian] Pretty good heist. 
 [Des] Oh, the gift was for Allison! I get it. What was it? 
 An engagement ring? You getting married? What's going on? 
 [Jake] It was a necklace, and why are you even talking? 
 I wasn't. I was just d-- I was thinking... Did you get your hair cut? No? 
 [Jake] Big question: Why was the Mayor there? 
 [Des] Hmm. Where? 
 ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [Christian] Let's find this gunman. Let's do this! 
 [Jake] Knock it off. 
 [Bill] Jake? Hello? 
 [Jake] Let me guess. You're looking for some gambling tips. 
 [Bill] Ha ha. No, no. Um, actually I was hoping I could, uh, have a word. 
 [Jake] Really? 
 [Des] Mal, he probably pinched a nerve. Or early signs of skeletal decay. He's not as limber as he used to be. 
 [Jake] What can I do to help you? 
 [Bill] Ah, no, no, no. Not on the phone. Um, can we meet? 
 [Christian] How limber are you? 
 [Des] Whoa! Hey! 
 [Jake] I'm actually kinda busy at the moment. 
 [Bill] C'mon, please, Jake. 
 This'll only take a minute of your time. 
 [Des] Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! 
 ( laughing ) 
 [Jake] Fine. Can you meet me now? 
 [Bill] Uh, now? G-great, yeah, now is perfect. 
 [Des] Stop, stop, stop! Jake! 
 [Christian] What? Where we going? 
 [Des] Hey! I-I'll just hold down the office, the fort. Did you guys eat? I made sandwiches! 
 Anyway, I'll ju-- hmm... 
 [Bill] I thought we'd be alone. 
 [Christian] Don't mind me. 
 [Jake] Yeah, he's just my brother. No harm. 
 [Bill] Right. Well, uh, that's great. Thanks for coming. I really appreciate it. I'm sure you understand my, um, concern about the events of last night. 
 [Jake] Yeah. You indulge in one little vice, wha? Next thing you know you got a hooker in your lap and 3 grams of coke on your plate. It's a classic tale. 
 [Bill] Those photos? They can't get out. I mean, I can't even think about what that would do to Leslie. 
 [Jake] Leslie? 
 [Bill] Yeah. 
 [Jake] And the fact that you're facing an election campaign has nothing to do with it, right? 
 [Bill] Yeah, yeah, of course it does, but either way I need to get that camera, and, um... I wanna pay ya to find it. 
 [Jake] You wanna hire me? 
 [Bill] Yeah. 
 [Jake] Whatever, fine. 
 [Bill] Well, that's great, that's great. A-and obviously I don't need to remind you that this conversation never happened? 
 [Jake] Obviously. 
 [Bill Or the poker game, either. 
 [Jake] That's a nice ride for a Mayor. 
 [Christian] Yeah. That one has the want in his eyes. In the worst way. 
 [Mal] But isn't it a little early for this? 
 [Rose] Honeymoon. Picture yourself on a beach somewhere. 
 [Mal] Shouldn't you be wearing your bikini? 
 [Rose] Let's just see where number 3 takes us. 
 [Mal] Maybe I should check in with the boys. Make sure they're both still alive. 
 [Rose] No you don't! One whole day off, start to finish! We need to start taking more breaks. 
 ( door opening ) 
 [Tinny] Hello? Hey. 
 [Mal] Oh, me back! 
 [Tinny] Poppy, what's wrong with ya? 
 [Rose] Oh, h-he's fine, he just-- his back is out. How are you, honey? 
 [Tinny] I'm fine. Is that a tequila bottle in the blender? 
 [Rose] Tinny honey, why don't you go to the office and help the boys? I have to stay here with him, obviously. 
 [Tinny] Sure. Do I get paid? 
 [Rose] Yeah, I'll take it off your rent. 
 [Tinny] See you later, poppy. I hope you feel better. 
 [Mal] Thanks, sweetheart. You have me lying to my granddaughter now! 
 [Rose] She'll live! Anyone for microwavable coconut shrimp? 
 [Mal] Now we're talking. 
 [Jake] So what, Lance, you were working in front of the restaurant all last night, right? 
 [Lance] Yeah, you call it working. Stood around for hours batting my eyelashes and I never got a single bite. 
 [Jake] Yeah, buddy. Don't worry. 
 It's them, not you, okay? So tell me, did you see anything? 
 [Lance] Yeah, I saw 3 working girls waiting in the alleyway. 
 [Jake] Really? What'd they look like? 
 [Lance] Oh, they were dressed skimpily as all hell. They were with this little, uh, little squirrely fella. 
 [Christian] See where they went? 
 [Lance] Yeah. Buddy took off on foot, and then, um... and then the girls hopped in a cab and drove away. 
 [Jake] If you see anything else, anything at all, give me a call, all right? See ya. Thanks. 
 [Lance] There was one other weird thing though. There were suits. Yeah, there was 2 suits sitting in a van. 
 [Christian] Well what were they doing? 
 [Lance] Just watchin'. 
 [Jake] Watching who? The girls? 
 [Lance] I dunno. Seemed like narcs to me. 
 [Jake] All right, Lance. Thanks! 
 [Christian] What the hell are we even looking for here? This. Is. 
 Disgusting. 
 [Jake] We're looking for evidence, my brother. 
 [Christian] Really? In the garbage behind the restaurant that he just robbed? You think he just dumped the gun here? 
 [Jake] Just imagine that you're a panicked moron, okay? And you just made it rich. Now, the panicked moron thing should be easy for you to identify with. 
 [Christian] Hey, hey! I'm trained as a lawyer, okay? I understand criminal-- 
 [j[Jake] Ha ha ha! Look! Now what'd I tell ya? Look familiar? 
 These could be the coveralls that our gunman was wearing last night. Check the manufacturer's label on that and cross reference it with any store in St. John's that might carry that kind of coverall. We might get lucky. Maybe the guy was stupid enough to use a credit card or his debit or something. 
 [Christian] Isn't that the judge from last night? Hm. Guess the Mayor's not the only one worried about those photos. 
 [Jake] Maybe he came back here to cover his tracks, but we beat him to it. See you later. 
 [Christian] Where're you going? 
 [Jake] Just... check out the coveralls and look into the judge. Earn your keep or you'll be fired. 
 ♪ 
 [Tinny] Des, what's with you? 
 I'm trying to get this boring crap done over here. 
 [Des] I just can't believe that I get a promotion and I'm stuck sitting on the bench. Meanwhile, the new guy gets to ride shotgun right outta the gate. 
 [Tinny] Well, what does uncle Jake always tell ya? 
 [Des] To get away from him? 
 [Tinny] The other thing. 
 [Des] I have unusually long arms? 
 [Tinny] No! Take initiative. Get out there on your own. 
 [Des] No, no, no. He usually yells at me for that. 
 [Tinny] He wouldn't yell at you if you actually found something worth finding. Okay, what about this Jean Francis woman? 
 [Des] I dunno. 
 [Tinny] She has a foundation downtown. Go see her, do a little digging. Show some independence, Des! 
 [Des] Yeah! Independence! Will you go with me, though? 
 [Tinny] Sure. 
 [Des] Good, good. 
 [Allison] There you are. 
 [Jake] Yeah, I had a long night. 
 Do you mind if I just go take a shower? 
 [Allison] I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any cream. I am so sick of living in a hotel room. I just... I wish that one of us had a bigger place. 
 [Jake] Yeah! 
 [Allison] You know, somewhere where we'd have, I dunno, like, a kitchen? 
 [Jake] "We?" 
 [Allison] I'm not pressuring you. 
 [Jake] Right... [Allison] I'm just pointing out that I live in a hotel room and you live in an office. 
 [Jake] Well, I like it here personally. I mean, it's got cleaners, you know? It's got room service. It's really quite luxurious. 
 [Allison] Jake. 
 [Jake] Okay, what're you getting at here? 
 [Allison] I'm not asking you to move in with me or anything. 
 [Jake] Or anything. 
 [Allison] I'm just pointing out that I'm sick of living out of a suitcase. That's all. 
 [Jake] But hey! I got you something. 
 [Allison] Okay. 
 [Jake] I mean I had-- I mean I have! I have it I-in a way, but, uh... 
 [Allison] Well, what is it? 
 [Jake] It's a present, and I am going to give it to you at a later date. 
 [Allison] Well, for future reference, that lead-in should probably be followed by whatever it was that you referring to. 
 Just saying. See ya. 
 ♪ 
 [Leslie] Hey. 
 [Bill] No, no, no, no, no. Go back to sleep. 
 [Leslie] It's okay. I was gonna get up anyway. 
 [Bill] No, no, no. You were working all night. I'll get out of your hair. Left my datebook behind, yesterday. 
 [Leslie] Yes, I thought you were gonna come back here last night. 
 [Bill] Well, I went out with the lads, remember? I told you about that. 
 [Leslie] Oh yeah, hockey. 
 [Bill] Yeah. 
 [Leslie] Y'know, you should get a better ice time. You are the Mayor, you know. 
 [Bill] All right, I did go out for a few after, but I ended up crashing at my place. Look, I'll come after work if it's not too late. 
 [Leslie] 'Kay. 
 [Bill] Sleep. 
 [Leslie] How's that new corvette? Must've cost a fortune. 
 [Bill] What, that? I-I leased it. 
 [Leslie] Oh. 
 [Bill] What, d'ya think I bought it? It's optics, y'know? People see you as a winner, they vote for you. I'll ditch it after the election. Oh, look, here. Got you your own keys. Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 [Christian] Yeah, so I traced the coveralls to 3 stores, and I-- 
 [Jake] Shh! Shut up! Close the door! 
 [Christian] I called every store pretending to be a bank. 
 [Jake] Just put these on. 
 [Christian] Tracking a transaction. It worked. 
 [Jake] Good for you. What'd you say this guy's name was again? 
 [Christian] Harry holden. Day labourer. He's got a rap sheet a mile long. Petty theft, mostly. 
 [Jake] Well, look around. Check the drawers, check the closets, see if you can't find my necklace. 
 [Christian] I dunno. Feels kinda kinky, looking through people's stuff like this. 
 [Jake] Okay, try not to linger in the guy's underwear drawer for too long, all right, brother? Bingo. 
 [Christian] Oh, nice. Have we gotta necklace? 
 [Jake] Well, I dunno. I haven't checked yet, have I? It's not here, son of a! 
 [Christian] Hey! Whoa! It's okay, man. 
 [Jake] He must've sold it already. Well, look at this. 
 [Christian] The Mayor's gonna be happy. 
 [Jake] Yeah. 
 [Christian] Hey, maybe he put the good stuff somewhere else? 
 People always stash their good stuff under the mattress. 
 [Jake] Yeah, maybe. 
 [Christian] Oh my God. 
 [Jake] What? 
 [Christian] I think I found Harry holden. 
 ♪ 
 [Des] An appointment? Uh, well why don't I just like make an appointment for like 10 minutes from now, I'll go get a coffee and come right back. Could be a chai latte in it for ya. Chai latte! 
 [Tinny] Des! Come here. It's the Francis woman with the Mayor. 
 [Des] Oh, look, look, look! 
 There she is with buddy the puffin! Cool! 
 [Tinny] But the Mayor was at the poker game, right? Take a picture of that one. It could mean something. 
 [Des] Right. 
 [Jean] I'm sorry, can I help you? 
 [Des] Uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, I-I'm Des Courtney with Doyle and... 
 Courtney investigations. Can you answer a few questions about last night? 
 [Jean] Who're you working for? 
 [Des] An interested party. 
 [Jean] Right. Okay, um, well, I was up most of last night worrying about this. I don't suppose that you've retrieved the photos? 
 [Tinny] No, but we're working on it. 
 [Jean] Okay. I dunno why I do it. You know, the gambling? 
 Something just overtakes me and... It's a problem, I know that. 
 [Des] I get the same way with jujubes. You just say you're just gonna have 30, right? 
 [Tinny] What my colleague means is we all have our vices. 
 [Jean] Right, well you have no idea what those photos will do to my foundation. 
 [Tinny] We'll find them. Don't worry. 
 [Jean] Well, thanks so much for dropping by. 
 [Tinny] Oh, Ms. Francis? I think you dropped this. 
 [Jean] Oh. Keep it, I've got more. I'm a great supporter of the Mayor. He's exactly what this city needs. Good luck. 
 ( police sirens wailing ) 
 [Leslie] 2 shots to the sternum with what looks like a small calibre pistol. Don't suppose you wanna tell me what you're doing here? 
 [Jake] Uh, we're just trying to get something back that belongs to me. 
 [Christian] A diamond necklace. 
 [Leslie] Oh, really? And uh, look what we got here. It's very nice likeness. 
 [Jake] It's not what it looks like. W-we were at a party, uh, sort of. W-we were working. 
 [Leslie] Oh, yeah. It looks like you working really hard. 
 [Christian] Those aren't our hookers. 
 [Jake] You're not helping. Just let me explain. 
 [Leslie] The only thing I need from you is a statement down at the station, if necessary. 
 [Jake] Sure. 
 [Christian] Absolutely. Can't wait. 
 [Jake] "Can't wait?" 
 ♪ 
 [Christian] It was a nice idea, taking shots of those lap dance photos before the cops showed up. 
 [Jake] Yeah, well, print them off for me, will ya? I gotta make a phone call. 
 [Christian] I wonder what Leslie would look like dressed like this. 
 [Jake] Excuse me? 
 [Christian] It's a joke, Jake. 
 [Jake] Just... watch yourself. 
 [Rose] This one has an oak-y flavour. 
 [Mal] See, all we have to do here is remove 3 walls from upstairs, extend the bathroom for the jacuzzi, and we're off to the races! 
 [Rose] Yeah, but I don't think the kids're gonna appreciate losing their rooms. 
 [Mal] I thought of that. We give Christian the boot, move Tinny into the small room, Des to the old office, changes the locks, and we're good to go! 
 [Rose] Des in the garage? 
 [Mal] We'll get him a space heater. 
 [Rose] Ooh. 
 ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [Mal] You're not planning to ever move back in here, are you? 
 [Jake] What? Uh, no. 
 [Mal] Good. 
 [Jake] Are you ever coming back to work or what? 
 [Mal] Get along with your brother! 
 [Jake] Wha, I-- we are getting along! Answer my question: Are you coming back to work or not? 
 [Mal] Look! Use this time together. It's precious. 
 [Jake] Are you drunk? 
 [Mal] What? 
 [Rose] No! It's the drugs, Jake. And he needs his rest. Doctor's orders. What're you doing? 
 [Mal] Let's try the 21 year old single malt and go over plan b. Des and Tinny move in with Jake. 
 [Rose] Nice. 
 
 
 
 [Christian] What's this? No, you took the actual photo of the Mayor? Jake, it's evidence in a murder case. 
 [Jake] Yeah, well, I didn't want Leslie to see it. 
 [Christian] Okay, I'm not sure what you're thinking here, but my gut tells me that this is not only about Leslie. 
 [Jake] Well tell your gut to shut its mouth. 
 [Christian] Hey, it's a little obvious that you're, you know, you're jealous of the Mayor. It's understandable. He's good looking. Powerful. 
 [Jake] Christian, please stop pestering me. 
 [Christian] I'm your older brother. It's my right. 
 [Jake] Okay, focus on finding my real girlfriend's necklace. 
 ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [Jake] What do you want? 
 [Des] Uh, okay. Don't get d.D. I went to see Jean Francis and I'm still there now. 
 [Jake] Jean Fran-- who told you to go see anybody? 
 [Des] Uhh, I can't reveal my sources? 
 [Tinny] Des actually got a lot out of the lady. He found out she's a compulsive gambler, and he got a photo of her with the Mayor. 
 [Jake] Really? Well, maybe there's more of a connection there than we thought. 
 [Tinny] She said she's a big supporter. 
 [Des] Okay, so what do you want me to do now? 
 [Jake] Put Tinny back on the phone. Look into Jean Francis, okay? And the foundation. See if you can find any reason at all why she'd wanna hold up a poker game. 
 [Tinny] Okay. 
 [Des] Hey, listen. Um, with regards to Christian working with you, I just gotta say, I think seniority should come into play here, man. I know you don't want a union comin' in here or anything, but I just-- hello? 
 Hello, Jake? 
 [Jake] So, everyone's got a photo except for the judge. 
 Where's his? 
 [Christian] Dunno. Maybe the gunman lost it? 
 [Jake] Or maybe the judge is the one that hired the gunman in the first place and he got his picture back. 
 [Christian] He showed up when we were getting those coveralls outta the garbage. Maybe he was there to get them himself? 
 Trying to cover his tracks? But why would that guy hold up a poker game? 
 [Jake] I dunno. Maybe he needed the money. You know, pay off debts, gambling debts maybe? 
 ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [Christian] You're gonna get brain cancer talking on that thing all the time. 
 [Jake] Hi. 
 [Bill] I heard about the gunman. 
 Did you find my photo? 
 [Jake] Uh... no. Not yet, but I'm looking into it. Don't worry. 
 [Bill] Great, great. I appreciate it. Did you say anything to Leslie about all this? Because she was asking questions this morning about what I was doing last night. 
 [Jake] Yeah, well, here's an idea. Why don't you tell her? 
 [Bill] Yeah, yeah, I think that ship has sailed. Look, I hope I can continue to rely on your discretion on this. 
 [Jake] Yeah, well, I'll keep you posted if I find anything new. 
 [Bill] All right. 
 [Christian] What? 
 [Jake] I dunno. I just... I'm getting this feeling like I'm being played or something. Let's go track down that judge. 
 ♪ ) 
 [Christian] Can't believe the judge agreed to see us. He doesn't even know who we are. 
 [Jake] Well, maybe he's expecting someone. Or something. 
 You never know, right? 
 [Judge] What do you two want? 
 [Jake] Hey there, judge Nelson. 
 I believe m met at the poker game last night, and we spotted each other earlier today. 
 [Judge] I know who you are. I got the phone messages. The answer is still no. 
 [Jake] What phone messages? 
 [Christian] We never left any phone messages, your honour. 
 [Judge] Yeah, right! You show up at the game, it's suddenly held up. I saw you fishing your buddy's coveralls out of the trash. 
 [Jake] No, no, no. Look, you're all mixed up here, okay? We're not working with the guy who ripped off the poker game. In fact, we found him dead earlier today. 
 [Judge] What? Is that supposed to be some kind of threat? 
 [Christian] No! Judge Nelson, we-- 
 [Judge] Now you listen to me! I don't care what you do with that photo. I am not caving to blackmail. And you can send that message back to the coward that sent you. 
 [Jake] Whoa, blackmail? Listen, pally, you got us mixed up with someone else. 
 [Judge] Call it whatever you want. The answer is still no. 
 Now get the hell out or I'll have you thrown out. 
 [Christian] I think we should do what the man says. Nice work. 
 Now the judge thinks we're blackmailing him. 
 [Jake] Well, someone's blackmailing him, and whoever it is knows where to find my necklace. 
 [Christian] I'm sorry, brother. 
 This isn't about a necklace. 
 This is about a pissing match between you and the Mayor. Even as a little kid you hated to be wrong. 
 ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [Jake] Wrong? What the hell are you talking about, wrong? 
 Hello? 
 [Leslie] Hey. I might be paranoid, but I think someone's watching me. 
 [Jake] You're hot and you're blonde. Of course people are watching you. 
 [Leslie] I'm serious. I'm pretty sure I'm under surveillance. 
 [Jake] Just-- I'll call you back in a few minutes, okay? 
 [Christian] What is it? 
 [Jake] Leslie thinks someone's following her or watching her or something. 
 [Christian] Did you sleep with her? 
 [Jake] Excuse me? 
 [Christian] Leslie. Whenever you do something bad, you always overcompensate and do something good for someone. 
 [Jake] Mind your own business, all right? 
 [Christian] That's how you ended up married to Nikki, remember? 
 How many necklaces that cost ya? 
 [Jake] I said-- what're you, 2 years old? Hey, what the hell? 
 [Christian] What're you doing?

 [Jake] So. I'm guessing you guys aren't from town, huh? Right. 
 ♪ 
 [Tarrant] Mr. Doyle. I'm inspector Tarrant. Sorry about the dramatics. 
 [Jake] Feds, eh? Let me guess. 
 Are you the guys who've been following Leslie Bennett around? 
 [Tarrant] That's none of your business. 
 [Jake] Okay. 
 [Tarrant] We have information that you were at a certain restaurant last night and that you're working for the Mayor. 
 [Jake] Well, that's none of your business. See? Doesn't feel so nice when it's said to you, now does it? 
 [Tarrant] Drop the case, Mr. 
 Doyle. 
 [Jake] What's this all about? 
 You know, a gunman is dead, a judge is being blackmailed. 
 [Tarrant] The less you know, the safer you'll be. 
 [Jake] This is really about Mayor Bill, isn't it? That's who you're after. 
 [Tarrant] At the fear of sounding rude yet again, it really is none of your business. 
 Just stay out of it. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Hello? 
 ♪ 
 [Christian] You okay? I was just about to call the cops. 
 [Jake] Yeah, well it was the cops who picked me up. 
 [Christian] What'd they want? 
 [Jake] I dunno. They want us off this case. I don't know why, they wouldn't tell me. We need to find out who's blackmailing that judge. I should've called you back. 
 [Leslie] What happened to you? 
 [Jake] Oh, well, I was arrested, sort of. 
 [Leslie] What're you talking about? We're not looking for you. 
 [Jake] Yeah, well it wasn't you. 
 It was the feds. 
 [Leslie] That's who's following me, isn't it? 
 [Jake] Why would they be following you? You've got nothing to hide, right? 
 [Leslie] Right. I'll talk to you. 
 [Jake] What? 
 [Christian] I just looked up some stuff on the judge, checked out his docket. He's heading up a big provincial inquiry. 
 Looking into kickbacks at city hall. To the tune of 20 million dollars. 
 [Jake] Really? 
 [Bill] Hey! Why so glum? 
 [Leslie] This is unexpected. 
 [Bill] Yeah, I was just down the hall. Thought I'd come by and say hi. So, good day? Bad day? 
 [Leslie] Average. Bad guys telling lies. Same old. 
 [Bill] Oh, um, you don't happen to know what Jake Doyle's working on right now, do you? 
 [Leslie] No, no idea. Why d'you ask? 
 [Bill] Well, a friend hired him and was wondering about his level of discretion, so uh-- [Leslie] Jake's? 
 [Bill] Yeah. 
 [Leslie] Jake wouldn't tell anybody about a client if he was asked not to. 
 [Bill] Yeah. That's what I thought. 
 [Leslie] Unless I asked him. 
 [Bill] Okay. 
 [Leslie] I should get back to work. 
 [Bill] Yeah, um, sure. Hey, have a good day. 
 [Leslie] 'Kay. 
 ♪ 
 [Des] Hey, hi. We were just tracking some stuff down on Jean Francis. 
 [Tinny] Yeah. So it turns out that she's from serious family money. Like it started with a gravel pit and turned into millions, and she inherited every cent. 
 [Jake] Well, obviously she wasn't trying to hold up a card game. Keep looking into her. See if you can find any connection to her and the Mayor or to city hall. 
 [Christian] Are we going to see who I think we're going to see? 
 [Tin] ] What's wrong? 
 [Des] Maybe I'm not cut out to be a detective. What does Christian have that I don't have? 
 [Tinny] That's kind of a complicated question. Him and Jake are brothers. 
 [Des] Yeah, yeah, yeah! Born only by blood! If I could take Jake's blood, I would. 
 [Tinny] Okay, why don't you look up everything you can find on all these people. 
 [Des] Yeah? 
 [Tinny] Yeah. Think hard. 
 [Des] Okay. 
 [Tinny] Okay, not too hard. You look like you're hurting yourself. Go get 'em, tiger. 
 [Des] Right, sure, okay. Who? 
 Who do I get? 
 [Mal] Jake, m'boy, how are ya? 
 Just wanted to know what case you're on. If you need help. 
 [Jake] Yeah, I could use your help to be honest. 
 [Mal] How're you and Christian? 
 You getting along? You should. 
 You're brothers. 
 [Jake] We're just doing fine. 
 He's doing a good job, actually. 
 Just don't tell him I said that. 
 [Mal] I remember the d y you were born. Part of me was hoping for another girl, but you make the most of what you got. 
 [Jake] Okay, dad, how many of those pills have you taken? 
 [Mal] Rose pays the bills. 
 [Jake] No, the pills. For your back. How many have you taken? 
 [Rose] No drinking and dialling. 
 Gotta go! 
 [Jake] Hello? 
 [Christian] What're we doing here? 
 [Rose] What did you say? 
 [Mal] That I'm happy Jake's not a daughter! 
 [Rose] Oh, dear God. 
 [Jake] Wait here. 
 [Christian] Why? What're you gonna do? 
 [Jake] Something I should've done a long time ago. I gotta talk to you. 
 [Bill] This has to be quick, Jake. 
 [Jake] Okay, someone's using those photos from the poker game to blackmail a judge. A judge who just happens to be heading up an inquiry into kickbacks at city hall. Now you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? 
 [Bill] Inquiry's confidential. 
 [Jake] If you're involved in this, tell me right now. 
 [Bill] Jake, I'm the one that asked you to find the camera. 
 Why would I do that if I was behind it? 
 [Jake] I dunno. Maybe your hired blackmailers turned the tables on you. It's motive enough to kill somebody. 
 [Bill] Killed? Y-you're paranoid. I-I am the Mayor of St. John's. I don't have people killed! 
 [Jake] Now you listen to me. I wanna make myself very, very clear here. If you're into anything, anything at all that might end up hurting Leslie... 
 [Bill] Oh, okay, I see. So you're gonna protect Leslie? 
 Believe me, she does not need you. 
 [Jake] Is that right? 
 [Bill] Because Leslie knows that she is far, far above you. 
 [Jake] I'm sorry, what did you say? 
 [Bill] Hey, you know what? Stop dreaming. It's pathetic. Ow! 
 [Jake] Look at me. Look at me! 
 If I find out you're dirty, and whatever crap you're into hurts Leslie, we will continue this little chat.

 [Tinny] What?

 ( car alarm turning on ) 
 [Christian] Come on, Jake. The judge isn't gonna want to see us anytime than he did before. 
 [Jake] No, he's got to know who the blackmailer is. 
 [Christian] How do you figure? 
 [Jake] Well he told us to give a message to the coward, so that means he probably knows who the coward actually is. 
 [Christian] Yeah, well he's not about to tell us, so let's get out of here before someone catches us. 
 [Jake] Um, Christian? 
 [Christian] What? 
 [Jake] Looks like he won't be investigating any kickbacks into city hall again. 
 ♪ 
 [Christian] Someone killed judge Nelson. 
 [Tinny] Oh my God! 
 [Jake] Yeah, with the same calibre gun that killed Harry holden. Whoever did it did both of them. What the hell is all this? 
 [Tinny] Des took it on. He just looked up everything he could find on every single person involved. 
 [Jake] Pretty impressive. 
 [Tinny] You gotta listen to what he found. I think he actually pulled it off this time. 
 [Des] Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. 
 So, I started by going into Jean Francis' family money, all right? 
 ( door knocking ) 
 [Jake] Oh! Hold that thought. 
 Hi. 
 [Leslie] Hey. 
 [Jake] Uh... look, I have something I have to tell you. 
 [Leslie] You punched-- [Jake] 
Punched Bill. Yeah. I guess he told you. He must've told you. 
 [Leslie] No. He has a black eye and I know he met with ya. Did the math. Anything else you need to tell me? 
 [Jake] Yeah. You might wanna come in. 
 [Leslie] Look, just cause he was playing poker when he said he was playing hockey doesn't mean he's corrupt. He knew I wouldn't approve. 
 [Jake] Right, and I'm sure there's a lot of guys who say they leased a car when they actually paid cash. 
 [Leslie] And the judge was looking into kickbacks at city hall? It doesn't mean he would've found anything, or that's why he was being blackmailed. 
 [Jake] Right. 
 [Leslie] You don't think so? 
 [Jake] Doesn't matter what I think. 
 [Leslie] Well, Bill couldn't kill anybody. Give that back to Bill. He'll tell me about all this when he's ready. 
 [Christian] She's standing by her man, isn't she? 
 [Jake] Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's not worth I [Tinny] Uncle Jake. 
 [Jake] Oh, yeah, right. Sorry, Des. Go ahead. 
 [Des] All right. So, I started by looking into Jean Francis' family money, checking the various generations, the companies that founded and grew, and then I took the judges results and I started cross-analysing and-- [Tinny] Des! Just cut to it, now. 
 [Des] Alright, all right. So, after Mayor Bill was elected, this company called newfoundland concrete started doing a lot of business with the city. 
 [Tinny] Yeah, like 12 million dollars worth of business last year alone. 
 [Christian] That's a lot of sidewalks. 
 [Jake] I see their trucks all over town. So what? 
 [Des] Newfoundland concrete is owned by Jean Francis' family. 
 [Jake] Really? Where'd you get this picture? 
 [Tinny] At the foundation. 
 Remember I told you there was a picture of Jean and the Mayor on the wall? 
 [Jake] Yeah. There's something el I interesting here. Harry Holden's mug shot, give it to me. 
 [Des] Try and stop me! Hey, I got it, I got it. 
 [Jake] Now, the last time I saw Harry holden he was dead, but I'm pretty sure this is the same guy. Des, you did nice work. 
 Great work, actually. 
 [Des] Thanks! Thanks. Oh man, cause you know, with the new promotion and everything I thought I should really, uh... ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [Des] I should really step it up, you know? So... [Jake] Yeah? 
 [Walter] Dude. Yeah, it's me. 
 Uh, look. You're not gonna believe this, but your old pal Mayor Bill and Jean Francis? 
 They're here. They're at the lucky dragon, right now. 
 Tragically, I see no hookers. 
 [Jake] Okay, you keep them there, all right? I'm on my way. 
 Jean Francis and the Mayor, they went back to the poker game. Why would they do that with all of this heat around them? 
 [Christian] Gamblers... gamble? 
 [Jake] No. I'm pretty sure this ain't about gambling. Gimme that. 
 [Christian] Let's go, brother! 
 [Jake] Well hello there! Walter, move over. 
 [Walter] Hey, uh, can I have a couple of bucks to loan me, do ya? 
 [Jake] No, I don't. How you gettin' on, Bill? 
 [Bill] Uh, fine. 
 [Jake] Now I am glad everyone's here, cause we're not playing for matchsticks. Everyone's little squeaky clean reputation is on the line. 
 [Bill] Well, it's all back safe and sound, and it was really nice of you to bring these back, so, thank you. 
 [Jake] Oh, no, no. No. These aren't the actual photos. These are duplicates. You see, the cops have the real ones. 
 [Bill] Really? 
 [Jake] Yeah, the cops. You know? 
 Like Leslie Bennett? You've heard of her, right? She's seen these. She knows all about the blackmailing of our dead judge, she even knows about the investigation into City Hall. 
 But it's not just the taking of the bribes that the cops are investigating, is it? They're also looking into who's doing the bribing. 
 Why are you looking at me? 
 Excellent question. Harry Holden. Anybody? Guy with the mask? The gun? Ripped off the card game? Took pictures of you all, you know, with hot chicks? 
 Someone killed him, and you know 'em. 
 [Jean] Nope. No, I don't know that man. I have my picture taken with all kinds of people. 
 I run a foundation. 
 [Jake] You also own newfoundland concrete, don't you? I'm just curious: How much money would you lose if you couldn't bribe your way into city hall business? Or if you went to Bill, say for fraud? 
 [Bill] I-I didn't, I don't know anything about this. I-I-I've never taken a bribe in my life. 
 I-I would... Really? 
 Yeah. Is that true, Jean? 
 You're gonna stand alone in all this, I'm guessing, Harry, he had the gun, he pulled it on you and somehow you got a holder** turn the tables on you, you had to shoot him. And the judge, what happened there? He wouldn't play along? ** [Jean] 
Everybody just stay where you are. 
 [Jake] What're you gonna do? 
 Shoot all of us? 
 [Jean] Just you, if you don't shut up! 
 [Christian] Jake! 
 [Jake] Yeah, I got this. 
 ( crowd gasping ) 
 ( whistling ) 
 [Bill] Give me that! 
 [Jean] Move! Move it! 
 [Jake] Don't be stupid, Jean! 
 Where're you going? 
 [Jean] I am not going to jail! 
 [Jake] I'm pretty sure you are, actually. 
 [Jean] It's not just me, you know. There're lots of people involved in this! 
 [Jake] Okay, I can work with that. So let's talk to the feds. 
 Maybe we can make a deal. 
 [Jean] I killed 2 people. 
 There'll be no deals. It wasn't supposed to go like this. I was going to be disgraced. 
 [Jake] Okay, Jean, I'm coming out. Just don't shoot, all right? Jean, you gotta turn yourself in. 
 [Jean] No! 
 [Jake] Okay, please stop shooting at me! Jean? Jean! 
 ( tires screeching ) 
 ( police siren ) 
 [Bill] What did she say? 
 [Jake] That she wasn't the only one involved. That there are others. 
 [Tarrant] You're determined to make this your business, aren't you? You wanna tell me what happened here? 
 [Jake] Not sure if I even know myself. 
 [Rose] So, how did you find your one day off? Did it kill you? 
 [Mal] It was fun, actually. 
 [Rose] Really? 
 [Des] So I've been thinking about asking for a raise, you know? Or a desk at least. 
 [Tinny] Yeah, I wouldn't push it. Poppy? Well you're feeling way better. 
 [Mal] What? Oh, yes. 
 [Tinny] Well, I'm glad you enjoyed your sick day. Although i think you were faking it to get uncle Jake and uncle Christian to spend more time together. Am I right? 
 [Mal] No flies on this one. So, how'd they make out? Either one kill the other? 
 [Des] I solved everything, to be perfectly honest. 
 [Tinny] Uncle Jake punched the Mayor and a couple other things happened, but they got on all right. 
 [Mal] What? 
 [Rose] I like having you here. 
 Nobody's pointing a gun at your face, or chasing you around in a car. 
 [Mal] Check the bank account again. Cuddling on the street's not so nice, is it? 
 [Rose] Uh-uh. Okay. You're right. 
 [Leslie] Hey, I heard what happened. It's horrible. 
 [Jake] Yeah, it was pretty horrific. 
 [Leslie] Bill knew nothing about it. The bribes, you know that, right? 
 [Jake] Yeah, he told me that too. Anyway, you didn't happen to drop anything off at my place, like a necklace maybe? 
 [Leslie] Yeah, we found a pawn ticket at Harry Holden's apartment. 
 [Jake] Well thank you. I appreciate it. 
 [Leslie] It'll, uh, it'll look great on her. She's lucky. 
 G'night, Jake Doyle. 
 [Jake] Goodnight, Leslie Bennett. 
 [Bill] Who's that? 
 [Leslie] Just a friend. 
 [Bill] I think you should rethink your friendship with Jake. I just don't trust him. 
 [Leslie] Really? 
 [Bill] I know I didn't tell you the truth about the other night, and I know that I have a bit of a gambling problem, but... I just need you to know that you can trust me. Do you? 
 [Christian] Still think the Mayor's involved in this? 
 [Jake] I think that maybe I am jealous and I wanted him to be dirty. 
 [Christian] Maybe. Maybe not. 
 [Jake] Either way, it was a pleasure working with you, brother. 
 [Christian] I'm sorry that I almost lost your necklace. 
 [Jake] Well technically you didn't almost lose it. You lost it. But luckily I got it back, so... Cheers. 
 [Christian] Cheers. 
 [Jake] All right. Call me a cab, will ya? 
 [Christian] Call it yourself. 
 [Jake] "Call it yourself!" 
 Later. 
 [Allison] It's beautiful. I love that it's been stolen and pawned. That's very romantic. 
 [Jake] Oh, yeah? Does that get you all hot and bothered? 
 [Allison] Yeah. It does. 
 [Jake] Well you should also know that it did some hard time in the police lockup. 
 [Allison] Really? 
 [Jake] Mm-hmm. 
 [Allison] All that effort. It's too bad it's glass. 
 [Jake] What? Gimme that. He switched it! 
 [Allison] I'm kidding! 
 [Jake] Ah, you are very mean.
