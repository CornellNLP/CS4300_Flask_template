 [Narrator] Previously, on Republic of Doyle. 
 ( cell phone ringing ) 
 [allison] It's my husband. 
 [Rose] Malachy Doyle, I've been waiting months for a honeymoon that never comes. 
 "Admit it, you had fun. Martin. 
 PS. I owe you 300 thousand." 
 [Tinny] Give me your hand. Hug me. 
 [Mal] You're like the son I never had. Welcome home, boy. 
 [Allison] I wish that one of us had a bigger place. You know, somewhere where we had... A kitchen. 
 [Jake] We? 
 [Mayor clarke] I think you should re-think your friendship with Jake. 
 [Leslie] Really? 
 [Christian] It's a little obvious that you're-- you're jealous of the mayor. 
 [Leslie] Bill, is he botherin' ya? 
 [Mayor clarke] I-- I'd rather not talk about it. 
 [Leslie] How's that new corvette? It must have cost a fortune. 
 [Mayor clarke] People see you as a winner, they vote for you. 
 [Jake] If you were into anything that might end up hurting Leslie... 
 [Mayor clarke] Stop dreaming. 
 Leslie knows that she is far, far above you.

 [mayor clarke] This kind of progress and development is exactly what this city needs! 
 ( crowd cheering ) 
 [mayor clarke] It has been an honor serving the city of St. 
 John's, and progress has been made, but there is more work that needs to be done. And that is why I seek re-election, to finish the work we started together! 
 [Justin] I think what the mayor is trying to say is that he'll bulldoze cabot tower and pave over the narrows, all in the name of progress! 
 [Mayor clarke] Of course what Mr. Slade is saying couldn't be farther from the truth. And you know what? I look forward to debating these issues with him and any other candidate. 
 [Rose] I don't like this guy. 
 [Mal] Me neither. 
 [Des] What were you doing to me? 
 [Tinny] You're such a wuss! 
 [Des] You know, you can't just set my hair on fire like that! 
 You know I have feelings! 
 [Mal] Knock it off! 
 [Woman] Good morning. 
 [Mal] Who was that? 
 [Rose] Guys! Hey-- hey, hey! 
 Chris! 
 ( rose sighing ) 
 [rose] Oh, cripes. 
 [Christian] She gone? 
 [Mal] Who's she? 
 [Christian] I gotta get to the bar. 
 [Mal] What is goin' on here? 
 [Rose] Don't ask me! They're yours! 
 [Mal] That's it! I gotta get out of here. 
 ( cell phone ringing ) 
 [Jake] Yeah? 
 [Mal] We gotta go meet the client now. 
 [Jake] I thought we weren't meetin' him for, like, an hour from now? 
 [Mal] I don't care. 
 [Jake] I'm goin' out! 
 [Tonya] Thanks for coming. Are either of you handsome gentlemen in the market? I'm showing this place to a client before the open house starts in about an hour. 
 [Mal] We won't take much of your time. 
 [Tonya] It's been on the market 6 months now. I can't seem to move it. 
 [Jake] What can we do to help you, Ms. St. Croix? 
 [Tonya] I'm developing a major project on the South side hills. 
 [Jake] Oh yeah, ocean point. 
 [Tonya] That's right. Someone's trying to stop it from happening. It's a controversial development. 
 [Mal] Taking the South side hills and turning it into a housing development is a bit of a deal. 
 [Tonya] Yes. Well, 25 people were signed up to purchase the property, and someone's been leaving them messages saying that the land is toxic, and scaring them off. And I think I know who. 
 [Jake] Who? 
 [Tonya] My arse of an ex-husband. 
 [Mal] Brett... Babcock. 
 [Tonya] Brett is currently my biggest competitor. He lost his share of the development when I divorced him for his indiscretions. Now he's trying to ruin it. 
 ( spraying air freshener ) 
 [Tonya] And I need you to have proof to stop him. 
 ( Jake coughing ) 
 [Jake] Has he... Done anything criminal? 
 [Tonya] Not yet, but he will. 
 ( water running ) 
 [Tonya] Do you hear that? What is that? Sounds like running water. 
 [Brett] Tonya! Excuse me, babe, I'm with a client! 
 [Woman] You didn't tell me you were bringing friends. 
 [Mal] Is that... 
 [Jake] The smoking gun. 
 [Brett] Brett Babcock. 
 5[Tonya] You son of a bitch! 
 She's my client! 
 [Jake] Well, I think he's already... Closed the deal. 
 ♪oh, yeah♪ 
♪oh, yeah♪ 
♪oh, yeah♪ 
♪oh, yeah♪ 
♪oh, yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah♪ 
♪oh, yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah♪ 
♪oh, yeah♪ 
 [Brett] Oh, you got a bad track record and you're trying to close-- 
 [Tonya] She's my client! 
 [Brett] Tonya! Just relax, b'y! 
 Just relax! What's the problem? 
 [Tonya] Uh, I just walked in on you banging my client, Brett! 
 That's the problem! 
 [Brett] Aah, she's the jealous type. It drives me. Listen, Tonya. Business is business. She needed an agent who could get the job done, so she came to me: Brett Babcock, the smoking gun. 
 [Jake] Classy. 
 [Mal] Brett, are you trying to wreck Tonya's development? 
 [Brett] What? No, that's ridiculous. 
 [Jake] So you weren't pissed when she cut you out of the deal? The whole oceans' point thing? 
 ( brett laughs ) 
 [brett] Ocean point? The city's never gonna let that fly. Justin Slade will see to that. 
 [Mal] Isn't he running against the mayor? 
 [Tonya] Yeah, and God help us all if he gets in! He's anti-development all the way. 
 [Brett] Oh, right on, b'y. 
 Another sale! Look at that. 
 Fellas, I gotta go. If you're lookin', I got guys who are sellin'. 
 [Jake] Thank you. 
 [Brett] Tonya, babe, if you wanna run with the bulls, you gotta have balls. 
 [Jake] Don't mind him. If he's involved, we'll find out. I'll dig around and see what I can find on him. 
 [Tonya] All of my money in the world is tied up in this deal. I could lose everything, so please just get to the bottom of it. 
 [Mal] We'll do everything we can. 
 [Jake] See ya later. 
 [Tonya] But give me that! 
 [Mayor clarke] Justin Slade? 
 He's a joke. He's an opportunist. If people like him had their way, this town would never move forward. 
 [Leslie] Yeah, but he does make an interesting point. I mean, we don't want this town lookin' like a strip mall, do we? 
 [Mayor clarke] What? 
 [Leslie] I'm just sayin', it's a special place. We don't wanna ruin it. 
 [Mayor clarke] Don't you start on that, okay? I need you 100% on my side, here. People are listening to this guy, and it's starting to show in the polls, so you just-- you just can't say those things outside these walls, all right? 
 [Leslie] Consider me muzzled. 
 [Mayor clarke] Look, I didn't mean it like that. Yeah. Look, I just... I need more Leslie Bennett than sergeant Bennett right now, okay? 
 [Leslie] Okay. I just want you to know what you're backin'. 
 [Mayor clarke] I do. I do know. 
 It is-- it still is gonna be special, okay? 
 [Leslie] Okay. 
 [Des] The smoking gun, Brett Babcock. 
 [Rose] No record on this guy, but his finances are in a bit of a dip since the divorce. 
 [Des] You know, some men underestimate the love of a good woman. 
 [Jake] Is your hair singed? 
 [Des] Wha...? No, no! A little, maybe. It was just like a love bite, but with fire. 
 [Mal] Who's this guy? 
 [Rose] This is Justin Slade. 
 [Mal] Yeah, he's the city's new savior, or so he claims. 
 [Rose] Yes. He was a bit of an activist in his university days. 
 He threw a pie in a politician's face and, uh, got arrested a couple times for disturbing the peace, that sort of thing. 
 [Jake] Really? Let's go talk to him. 
 [Mal] A mayoral candidate sabotaging a land development? 
 [Jake] Well, you know, stranger... Things have happened. Let's go. See ya, rose. 
 [Des] Yeah, see you guys later. 
 Aah, it's a good case. 
 [Rose] Another day at the grindstone. 
 [Des] Want me to run out for a coffee? Tea? Coffee? Tea? 
 Coffee? 
 [Rose] You decide. 
 [Des] I'll pick. Coffee. 
 [Justin] So, you think I'm trying to destroy Tonya St. 
 Croix's real estate business. 
 Think that would be a smart move by me? 
 [Mal] It's no secret you're against ocean point, and you do have a history of taking things into your own hands. 
 [Justin] Look, I applaud whoever's trying to stop that woman, and I will put an end to this travesty she's trying to build, believe me. 
 [Jake] Oh yeah? How you plan on doin' that? 
 [Justin] Through legal and political channels. Have a look at this. Here's what the South side hills looks like right now. 
 Here's what it will look like if Ms. St. Croix gets her way. 
 [Jake] Wow. 
 [Justin] So you can see why I'm running for mayor. Someone needs to preserve this town. Mayor Clarke has his own agenda. 
 [Mal] Thank you for your time, and, uh, good luck with the campaign. 
 [Justin] Thank you. You're a private eye, right? Detective? 
 [Jake] Yeah. 
 [Justin] I've got something-- I might have something that people would like to know about mayor Clarke. 
 [Jake] Is that right? 
 [Justin] There's more to this whole ocean point thing. I could use a PI to help me crack it open. 
 [Jake] If you think I can help, why don't you give me a call? 
 See ya 'round. 
 [Mal] What was that? 
 [Jake] Nothin'. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] So this is it, hey? This is what all the fuss is about? 
 [Mal] Seemed like people would want the view. Too bad it wrecks things for the rest of the town. 
 [Tonya] All of the survey sticks were yanked out overnight. Three of the truck engines were sabotaged and the trailer was broken into! 
 [Jake] Well, you know, you can't help but wonder, maybe people just don't want this. 
 [Tonya] You can't stop progress. 
 And if we didn't do it, somebody else would. And in our defense, we are preserving as much of the cultural integrity of this site as possible. 
 [Jake] Great. Well, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna have a look around. 
 [Tonya] Of course, feel free. 
 Shouldn't you be taking fingerprints or something? 
 ( door closing ) 
 ( Jake sighing ) 
 [Jake] Real estate leads. This thing is gonna be ugly. William Cadigan Clarke... The mayor's Boug property here? William Cadigan Clarke goes back on the board. 
 [Mal] Takin' a bit of a leap there, don't you think? 
 [Jake] He's involved somehow, I know it. Rose? 
 [Rose] Okay, well it's a totally legit standard financing plan. 
 Clarke bought one of the units, but there's nothing illegal about .. 
 [Jake] No, nothing illegal, but it still means he has a vested interest in this eyesore of a cash cow. 
 [Mal] I think you're lookin' for somethin' that's maybe just not there. 
 [Jake] I'm gonna go talk to somebody that's in the know. 
 I'll catch up with Tonya later. 
 [Des] I guess, uh, I'll head back to the house. You know, there are few delicates in the washer, and then maybe we could rent a movie? 
 [Mal] No! 
 [Des] Okay, or we could go to one. Oh! There's this deadly new one about this guy who's half-wolf, half-dolphin: Wolfin. 
 Now, I'm not usually one for romantic comedies, but this looks really, really good! 
 [Rose] Sounds really great. 
 [Mal] No! No, no, no, no. Me and rose need some more alone time. 
 [Rose] Yeah. 
 [Des] Well, oh, that's great! 
 Then me and Tinny can follow the smoking gun, Brett Babcock! 
 [Rose] Oh... kay. 
 [Des] Okay! 
 [Rose] But just no-- uh, you know, where he goes, what he does. And don't talk to him! Oh gosh, what are we going to do? 
 [Mal] Two teenagers in the house is like letting a storm loose. 
 [Rose] They've been getting pretty chummy lately. I can tell by the way she beats on him. 
 [Mal] Think we need to have a chat with them? 
 [Rose] Wouldn't hurt. Is it ever gonna just be you and me? 
 [Mal] I'll just be happy if we don't add to the total we got. 
 ♪ 
 ( Leslie sights ) 
 [Jake] No, no, no! Come on, Leslie! Please come back. 
 Leslie, please. I have to talk to you. It's important. 
 [Leslie] I know that whatever you say is gonna ruin my day somehow, so why don't you get it over with? 
 [Jake] Are you aware that your boyfriend, the mayor, has invested in property at ocean point development site? 
 [Leslie] How do you know that? 
 [Jake] I saw his name on a contract in the mobile trailer at the site. 
 [Leslie] Well, that doesn't mean he's doing anything wrong. 
 [Jake] Well, it doesn't exactly look good, Leslie. 
 [Leslie] Jake, honestly, I don't think this is your concern. So I think you should back off. 
 ( cell phone buzzing ) 
 [Jake] Well, I thought maybe that you'd wanna know. Whatever. 
 I gotta go anyway. 
 [Leslie] Yeah, great. Yeah. 
 ♪ ) 
 [Tinny] Des! 
 ( Des gasping ) 
 [Tinny] What are you doin'? 
 [Des] Well, to prepare for a stake-out, one must be prepared. 
 For example, I'm lookin' for intel on one Brett Babcock, real estate agent. 
 [Tinny] Stake-out. 
 [Des] Mmm-hmmm. 
 [Tinny] What stake-out are we talkin' about here? 
 [Des] The one you and I are gonna do. 
 [Tinny] Not a chance. 
 [Des] There's b bucks in it for you if you cooperate. 
 [Tinny] 50. 
 [Des] Done. But just for the record, I would have gone to 60. 
 [Tinny] 60, then. 
 [Des] Well-played, Tinny Doyle. 
 Well-played. Uh-- some things are best left unsaid. 
 [Mayor clarke] Knocking on doors in every neighbourhood, okay? 
 Excellent, go. So everyone-- [Leslie] Hey. 
 [Mayor clarke] Hey, hey! Look, my day just got a whole lot better. Hi, hi. 
 [Leslie] Bill, I need to talk to you about somethin'. 
 [Mayor clarke] You're so serious. I'll meet you later, okay? Bye. 
 [Man] Okay. Thank you. 
 [Mayor clarke] Thanks. 
 [Leslie] Do you own property on that new development, ocean point? 
 [Mayor clarke] W-what? Who told you that? 
 [Leslie] Jake came across your name. He's workin' a case for Tonya St. Croix. So it's true? 
 [Mayor Clarke] Where did he see this information? 
 [Leslie] At the building site. 
 In the portable office. 
 [Mayor clarke] Well, leave it to Jake Doyle to ruin it, then. 
 [Leslie] What are you talkin' about? 
 [Mayor clarke] The surprise. 
 Look. Don't worry, it'all on the up and up. I bought it after the approval, and I know it looks like a-- a slight conflict of interest, but believe me, the council knows all about it. 
 [Leslie] But why are you buying up there? 
 [Mayor clarke] Well, why do you think? It's for us.

 [Jake] Hello? 
 [Allison] Hello. Hi. 
 [Jake] Uh, what the hell is all this? 
 [Allison] Courtesy of my ex. I guess you scared him so bad that he sent all my stuff from Toronto. 
 [Jake] Obviously he has a lot to learn in the packing department. 
 [Allison] I don't know what to do with all this. It's a bit much. You know, I mean, with my living arrangements and all isis stuff now-- 
 [Jake] Well, you know what, there's a wicked flea market in the Avala mall. We could sell it for... A profit... 
 [Allison] This is my stuff, Jake. I'm serious. This is my whole life. 
 [Jake] All right, I'll tell you what. I'll get the old man's pick-up truck. We'll throw it all in there and find a place to stick this stuff at the office or the bar or somethin', all right? 
 [Allison] Thank you. But I need to get a place soon or I'm gonna lose my mind my own place, or... 
 [Jake] Or? 
 [Allison] Or...? Okay, seriously, have you ever thought about what our next step would be? Might be? 
 [Jake] Well you know, Allison, I don't think we should, you know, just move in together because we're both looking for a place to live, right [Allison] Yeah, I know. I-- I-- I'm-- I...

 [justin] You're destroying the fabric of St. John's with this monstrosity of a development. 
 [Tonya] No, you have no right to be here! We have approval by council! 
 [Justin] Our current city council's a joke. 
 [Tonya] Well, this is just a cheap way to scam a few votes! 
 [Justin] Whoa, whoa! 
 [Jake] Okay, everyone just calm down here, all right? I'm sure we can come to a very happy resolution non-violently. 
 [Tonya] I've had enough. I am calling the police.

 [justin] It's unfortunate what happened today, but I assure you I had nothing to do with it. 
 [Leslie] We got an eye witness who says you were seen leavin' that trailer a few hours ago with some documents. 
 [Justin] What eye witness? Then charge me! 
 [Leslie] There was a pilot light that went out in one of the two heaters in that trailer. There was a slow gas leak-- 
 [Jake] This is an interesting way to keep tabs on the competition. 
 [Mayor clarke] I'm here to surprise Leslie. 
 [Jake] So, Leslie doesn't know that you're watching an interrogation of the guy who's actually trying to steal your job? I'm not a lawyer or a cop, but I'm pretty sure that this is wrong. 
 [Mayor clarke] Okay, you know what? I've had it with your, uh-- your interest in Leslie, and I don't like the head games that you play with her. 
 [Jake] I'm the one who's playing head games? Right. Listen, uh, Cadigan, you're dirty, and I'm... 
 [Mayor clarke] Is that right? 
 [Jake] Mmm-hmmm. You see, I'll keep peeling back the layers until I get to the smelly, rotted core that is you.

 [Jake] Hey. Where's Tonya? 
 [Mal] She's in the shower. Said she felt dirty. Didn't stop her from trying to sell me a condo, though. 
 [Jake] Right. So, the cops think it was arson. Who would benefit from, uh, blowing up a trailer? 
 [Mal] Brett Babcock? He's a busy boy. Seems he's got a dozen or so investors lined up in case Tonya goes under. 
 [Jake] She loses the property. 
 [Mal] Brett swoops in, picks it up at bankruptcy prices. Yes, Jake, there is a girl in the shower. 
 [Jake] Aah, don't look at me like that, all right? I-- I have a girlfriend, so let's just move on. You know what? I still think the mayor is involved in all of this.

 [Allison] Wow, that's quite the turnaround. 
 [Jake] Allison, I should tell you, this is, uh-- she's a client. A client. 
 [Allison] Oh, yeah. That's fine. I'm yankin' your chain, Jake. Mostly. Well, give her my name, 'cause I need a place.

 [Tonya] Well, fine. We'll discuss details later. 
 [Jake] Why don't you tell me about the mayor, hmm? Clarke? He bought a property from you, didn't he? 
 [Tonya] Confidentiality. But I do have a lot of influential clients lined up to buy. Or I did. 
 [Jake] Right.

 Target has a chainsaw! Oh my God, he's gonna cut down the house. Or people! Oh my God, can he cut down people?

 [Jake] Look, forget about Brett, the smoking gun, okay? We need to figure out why the mayor was breaking into Justin's office. 
 [Rose] Well, maybe Justin does have some dirt on him. 
 [Mal] Or maybe it's just dirty politics.

 [Jake] I can prove this. 
 [Mal] Why would the mayor be trying to destroy ocean point when he's actually publically supporting it? Maybe it's time to give it a rest, son. I'm gettin' worried about you here. 
 [Jake] Fine, okay. I'll give it a rest. 
 [Mal] Check in with Tonya. I'll look into Brett. 
 [Jake] All right. 
 [Mal] I know how to get a guy like that's attention. 
 [Jake] See ya later. 
 [Mal] Hi. Yes, I'd like to request the Brett Babcock free smoking gun appraisal. 
 ( Jake knocking ) 
 [Jake] So, you're an ex-con candidate now. You're a shoe-in. 
 [Justin] What can I do for you, Jake? Here to pick up secrets for the mayor? 
 [Jake] No. I actually came here to tell you that I found the mayor breaking into this office. 
 ( hammering ) 
 [justin] Russell? Take a break. 
 Thank you. Unbelievable. We thought something happened last night, but I never would have thought the mayor would stoop that low. He's a real sleveen, isn't he? 
 [Jake] Yeah, he certainly is. 
 You should call the cops. I'll give a statement. I mean, if that means anything to ya. 
 [Justin] I should. And I'll just add it to my list of the mayor's dirty dealings. 
 [Jake] You know, the mayor, he's bought property in ocean point. 
 You know that, right? 
 [Justin] Yeah. I know more than that. 
 [Jake] Really? Care to enlighten me? I'm just lookin' for the truth, here. 
 [Justin] Yeah, I will, Jake. 
 When the time's right. Thanks for comin'. 
 [Jake] You know, for what it's worth, I think you might make a decent mayor. 
 [Justin] Might? Well, I appreciate the vote of confidence.

 [allison] Hey, Jake. 
 [Jake] Hi. 
 [Allison] I got your invite about the open house. Sounds promising. 
 [Jake] My invite to the what now? 
 [Allison] Oh, come on. The open house. Your agent called me. 
 [Jake] My agent... right. 
 [Allison] Tonya St. Croix. Okay, so do you wanna meet me there, or shall I pick you up? 
 [Jake] Whatever you prefer, I guess, honey. 
 [Brett] I must say, ladies, I've really enjoyed what I've seen. 
 And the house isn't too bad either. Uh, let me get this straight-- you two are sisters, right? 
 [Rose] Right? Um, do you think we could get a fair price? 
 [Brett] Turn-of-the-century victorian home in the heart of the downtown metropolis? You'll do more than fair. 
 [Rose] Great. So, uh... 
 [Brett] So, why don't you show me some more of what you got? 
 Let's go upstairs, take a look at some bedrooms. 
 [Tinny] Uh, sure. 
 [Rose] Okay. 
 [Tinny] Right this way. 
 [Brett] Excellent. Very exciting. After you. 
 [Tinny] No, please. After you. 
 [Brett] Whichever. 
 ( cell phone ringing ) 
 [mal] Yeah? 
 [Rose] Hey. 10 minutes. 
 [Mal] Right. Nice work, son. 
 [Des] Well, Jake usually just screams the instructions. This is way better. 
 [Mal] Wow. Something unsettling about a man who drives around with giant signs of himself. 
 [Des] What are these? 
 [Mal] Oh. I guess what real estate agents call leads. They cost a fortune. These are all addressed to Tonya St. Croix. 
 Here, take a picture. Oh, and Des, by the way, I just wanted to say, uh, you're welcome to stay at my house as long as you want. 
 [Des] Oh, thanks, thanks. I feel so at home there. 
 [Mal] Ah, uh, that I trust you completely, and I know you'd never do anything to break that trust. 
 [Des] Okay. Good. 
 [Mal] Glad I made myself clear. 
 [Brett] It's been a pleasure meeting you ladies. Give me a call when you're ready to list. 
 Give me a call if you have any questions. You know what? Just call me. 
 [Rose] Sure. We will. 
 [Brett] Your appraisal's on the back of the card. At first glance, I'm going to say this listing will be smoking hot. 
 Brr. All right, well, you have my card. Take care. 
 [Tinny] Ugh! Yuck, b'y! 
 [Rose] I'll say. Holy sh--! 
 [Tinny] What is it? 
 [Rose] Nothing. I have to go. 
 Oh, and stay away from Des! 
 [Leslie] Bill? 
 [Mayor clarke] What do you have on Justin Slade? I really have to know. 
 [Leslie] Bill, are you asking me to dig up dirt on your opponent? 
 [Mayor clarke] Leslie, please, I... The m-mayoral debates are coming up. I am slipping in the polls. Anything you can give me on this guy would really save me right now. 
 [Leslie] Is there something you want to tell me? Somethin' doesn't feel right here. 
 [Mayor clarke] There's nothing sinister going on. I'm trying to win an election here. 
 [Leslie] Justin thinks you're involved in something unethical, and whatever it is, he's gonna drop it at the next debate. So you might as well come clean with me. 
 [Mayor clarke] I can't seem to convince you. I wish you had as much faith in me as you do in Jake Doyle. I'm gonna go for a drive.

 [Jake] Yeah. It's definitely, um, you know... here. 
 [Allison] Master bedroom has a fireplace. 
 [Jake] Oh, hey, why don't you go take a peek at that? Think dirty thoughts, all right? I gotta answer this. Yeah? 
 [Justin] Jake, it's Justin Slade. I need to see you again. 
 I've got something to show you, and I think you're the only one I can trust. 
 [Jake] Okay. When? 
 [Justin] At my office in an hour. I've got a precaution to take first. 
 [Jake] Precaution? 
 [Justin] I'll see you then. 
 [Jake] Fine. 
 [Allison] Jake, I think this is the place for us. 
 [Tonya] You have to see the view from the deck! Come on. 
 [Allison] Are you coming? 
 [Jake] Uh, no, actually, I gotta work. I gotta go. But why don't you have a look around, and you take lots of pictures for me?

 [Jake] Leslie, w-w-why are you calling from the mayor's phone? 
 [Leslie] Jake, what are you doin' talkin' to bill? He's called this number over and over. 
 [Jake] Actually, this is my client's phone, Tonya St. Croix. 
 You know, the land developer, ocean point, all of that. 
 [Leslie] The woman he bought the house from. Yeah, well, that makes sense. I mean, he'd-- he'd call his real estate agent.

 [Jake] Leslie. 
 [Leslie] Forget it. I gotta go. 
 [Allison] Hey, I thought you were heading out. 
 [Jake] Yeah, I am. I am. I'll, uh-- I'll see ya. So, you look around; You have fun; You enjoy the place. Lots of pictures. 
 [Rose] Gotta love the new market, huh? 
 [Mal] That's a big number. But you're not actually thinkin' we should sell... 
 [Christian] Hey, guys. 
 [Rose] Hey. 
 [Christian] Thanks, dad. 
 [Rose] No. Why would we want to sell this place, huh?

 ♪ 
 [Leslie] No witnesses. Nobody saw anything. He was hit over the head with a blunt object. 
 Did he say what he wanted to talk to you about? 
 [Jake] Um, he just said he had something that he wanted me to see, and he thought I was the only person he could trust. 
 [Leslie] Jake... do you think that... Do you think bill could have done this? 
 [Jake] Why do you ask? 
 [Leslie] I told him that Justin was diggin' up somethin' on him. 
 [Jake] I don't know, Leslie. 
 Honestly, I don't. 
 ( cell phone ringing ) 
 [Jake] I'm sorry. 
 [Tonya] Hello? 
 [Jake] Tonya, something's happened. 
 [Tonya] Well, what's going on? 
 [Jake] Someone killed Justin Slade. 
 [Tonya] Oh my God! Well, who would do such a thing? 
 [Jake] I don't know for sure, but whoever it is, I think they have a problem with your development, so you're in danger. Just stay at home until you hear from me, okay? 
 [Jake] Whoa, wait a minute. 
 Where did this photo come from? 
 [Des] Oh, mal and I were doin' a little digging, working together. 
 [Mal] Yeah, we found them in Brett's car. They're real estate leads. 
 [Jake] Real estate leads, eh? I saw these when I was in Tonya's trailer, before the thing blew up. 
 [Mal] So Brett's gotta be our guy, then. 
 [Des] Yes. 
 [Jake] Look. Brett's beef was with Tonya, not with Justin. 
 [Rose] Yeah, but if Brett manages to get the property from Tonya-- [Des] He'd still have to get Justin out of the way to develop it. 
 [Jake] Shut up. 
 [Des] Okay! 
 [Jake] Obviously the mayor is the prime suspect here. 
 Seriously, think about it. He knew Justin was investigating him. Maybe Justin was gettin' o o close to the truth. 
 [Mal] That's a serious accusation, Jake. 
 [Des] I agree. 
 ( cell phone ringing ) 
 ( Jake sighing ) 
 [Jake] Hi. 
 [Tonya] Jake, can you get over here? I think someone's trying to break into my house. Hurry!

 [Jake] Sorry. 
 [Leslie] Why do you insist on following me everywhere? 
 [Jake] I'm not following ya! 
 [Mal] Actually, Tonya asked us to meet her here. 
 [Tonya] You stay away from me, you son of a bitch! You keep... 
 [brett] Well, what are you screaming about? What is wrong with you? Ow! What? Oh, what's going on here? I haven't done anything! 
 [Tonya] He threatened to kill me. You check his briefcase. 
 [Jake] All right. Ooh... whoa. 
 I'm no expert, but... This kind of looks like a murder weapon. 
 [Brett] I didn't kill anybody. I was nowhere near Justin Slade's that night. I was at a... Special sort of party. 
 [Leslie] Really? So what were you doing carrying around the murder weapon in your briefcase? 
 [Brett] I don't even know how that got there, I swear. 
 [Leslie] We know you're the one responsible behind the mess surrounding this site. Okay? You torched a trailer. We found Tonya's real estate leads in your car. 
 [Brett] All right, look, I tried to take some of Tonya's clients, and I blew up the trailer. I figured I-if Tonya dropped the South side development, I could get in there, I could pick it up for myself. But sergeant, I didn't kill anybody. 
 [Leslie] Yeah, right. 
 [Brett] I'm not the violent type. 
 [Jake] What do you think? 
 [Mal] A lot of money involved. 
 [Jake] Doesn't mean he's a killer, though. 
 [Leslie] You know what I'm thinkin'? I'm thinkin' you suspected that Tonya knew that you killed Justin, and you went over to shut her up. 
 [Brett] No, no, no! She invited me over there; It was just supposed to be s*x! We have this wicked s*x life. Particularly when we're not getting along. 
 ( brett sighing ) 
 [brett] I should probably speak to a lawyer, eh? 
 [Leslie] Yeah. 
 [Hood] His story checks out. He was at something called a key party. 
 [Jake] A key party? 
 [Hood] Apparently they're orgy-type things. He has 35 people to corroborate his story. 
 It's all on tape. 
 [Leslie] And where does that leave us? 
 [Mal] Square one. 
 [Hood] Well, I'll be in my office reviewin' the tape for further... evidence. 
 [Mal] Let's go, Jake. 
 [Jake] Ah, I'll catch up with you in a bit, dad. So... there's still a killer out there. 
 [Leslie] Let me handle this. 
 [Jake] I caught the mayor breaking into Justin's office. 
 And Leslie, he looked pretty desperate. 
 [Leslie] I gotta get back in there. I'll call you later, okay?

 [Jake] Brett the smoking gun didn't do anything. 
 [Mal] Your mayor theory. Oh look, someone left this for you. 
 It's fr-- Justin Slade. 
 [Jake] "Jake, thought you might be interested in this. Justin." 
 He left th f for me before he died. 
 [Mal] What is it? It's a land survey. It's old, by the looks of it. 
 [Jake] And this is a land deed r r the site where they're developing ocean point. 
 [Mal] What about it? 
 [Jake] Tonya doesn't own the land in the South side hills. 
 [Mal] And who does? 
 [Jake] We do. It's crown land, the whole development. It's illegal. 
 [Mal] Ocean point was approved on crown land? It's not legit? 
 [Jake] That must be what Justin wanted to talk to me about. 
 The-- the mayor, he was pushin' this past council. 
 [Mal] Trying to build on land he can't even known. That info gets out, it would sink the development for sure. 
 [Jake] It would take Tonya down with it. 
 [Leslie] Hello?

 [Jake] Planning a little trip, are we? 
 [Tonya] Oh! You scared me. Uh, yeah, yeah. I was-- um, just needed to get away for a while. 
 I mean, you caught the murderer, didn't you? 
 [Jake] Oh yeah. We caught her, all right. 
 [Mal] You framed Brett for Justin Slade's murder. 
 [Tonya] Why would I do that? 
 [Jake] Well, we figure he found out about the fact that you were developing on land that you didn't actually own. So you kill him, you call Brett Babcock over... 
 [Mal] And put the hammer in his briefcase. 
 [Leslie] Then you called us. 
 [Tonya] No, you have no proof of that. 
 [Leslie] See, that's where you're wrong. You cleaned the prints off the hammer, but you forgot to do the same for the briefcase. 
 [Tonya] It was an accident. 
 [Jake] Oh, you accidentally smashed Justin's head in with a hammer. 
 [Tonya] No, I went over to talk to him, to try to come to some kind of an understanding. 
 [Mal] You mean bribe him? 
 [Tonya] No. 
 [Jake] But he wouldn't take the bribe, I'm guessing. 
 [Tonya] Justin told me about his findings and that he was planning to blow this whole development out of the water. I worked so hard to get here. 
 [Leslie] Did the mayor know that this was crown land? 
 [Mal] It might help with your plea-bargaining. 
 [Tonya] Yeah, the mayor knew. We were covering it up until all the units were built. That way it would be too late. 
 [Leslie] And why would the mayor do this for you? 
 [Tonya] I paid him to do it. He was going to make a percentage of the profits, and he was going to get a free house.

 [Leslie] Don't. Tonya confessed to the murder and her deal with you. We know you were coverin' up the fact that she was buildin' on crown land. I know you were makin' a profit. So did Justin. A man died 'cause of all this.
