 [Narrator] Previously, on Republic of Doyle. 
 [Tinny] Don't wait for orders. 
 Just go for it when the opportunity presents itself. 
 [Mal] You're welcome to stay at my house as long as you want. I trust you completely, and I know you'd never do anything to break that trust. 
 [Rose] Picture yourself on a beach somewhere. 
 [Mal] Shouldn't you be wearing a bikini? 
 [Rose] You get on a plane, and you fly away, and the world doesn't end while you're gone. 
 [Mal] That's a big number. 
 You're not actually thinking we should sell? 
 [Rose] Why would we want to sell this place, huh? 
 [Allison] Have you ever thought about what our next step would be? 
 [Jake] Allison, I don't think we should, you know, just move in together because we're both looking for a place to live. 
 [Bill] You were an officer, right? The R.N.C.? 
 [Jake] A long time ago, yeah. 
 [Bill] Mind if I ask what happened there? 
 [Jake] Yeah. 
 [Leslie] William Cadigan Clarke, I'm arresting ya on suspicion of fraud. 
 [Jake] He didn't do anything wrong. 
 [Leslie] I have my suspicions. 
 ♪ 
 [Karla] I appreciate you guys looking to this for us. I mean, with millions of dollars passing through here on their way to a.T.M.'S every day, no one gets through those doors without a security check. 
 [Jake] Well, um, my advice? I wouldn't hire any of these guys. 
 [Mal] None of them have records, but we were able to dig up accusations of petty theft and pilfering. That one has a gambling habit. 
 [Karla] Thanks again. Follow me. 
 And wait here, okay? I'll get the cheque. 
 [Mal] Honest to God, Jake. You have to hit on every single one of them? 
 [Jake] What b'y? Don't be such a prude. It's called flirting. 
 People under the age of, you know, 120, they tend to do it a lot. This place from the outside looks like a warehouse. You'd never know that every a.T.M. In the province is probably getting cash from this place. What do you want? I'm working? 
 [Des] Underwear. 
 [Jake] What? 
 [Des] Do you like them folded or rolled? Personally, I'm a rolled man myself. 
 [Jake] Why are you touching my underwear? 
 [Des] Oh, hey Tinny! Here's your bra. 
 [Jake] W-what did you just say to my niece? 
 [Des] Uh, I said, uh, I said, "what're ya at, bra." 
 [Tinny] Dessy's just being a good little housewife. 
 [Jake] Okay, you two. First of all, we gotta start laying down some house rules, all right? 
 [Tinny] Chill! We're fine. 
 [Des] ( Whispering ) is this Jake's? 
 [Jake] Rule #1: Never tell me to chill. Rule #2: Don't touch each other's underwear. Ever. Ever, ever. 
 [Tinny] Ah! 
 ( glass shattering ) 
 [Jake] Tinny? Tinny, what's happening? 
 [Crocker] Hey, kids! 
 [Tinny] Oh my God! Uncle Jake, there's a man in the house! 
 [Des] Ah! Ow! 
 [Crocker] C'mere! Woo! 
 [Jake] Tinny! 
 [Mal] What is it? 
 [Jake] I don't know! 
 [Des] You let go of her, or else! 
 [Crocker] That's some knight in shining armour you got there! 
 You best tend to him! 
 [Jake] Tinny! What's going on? 
 You have to talk to me! 
 [Crocker] Hey there, good buddy. 
 I'm so glad to hear you're doing well. It's been long time. 
 [Jake] Who is this? 
 [Crocker] Well, usually if you think real hard, you'd probably figure it out, partner. 
 [Jake] Crocker. 
 [Crocker] Oh! Gotta go! Got a couple of things that need to be stashed out of harm's way. 
 [Jake] Crocker! 
 [Crocker] Children! 
 ( gun cocking ) 
 [Mal] What the hell is going on? 
 Tell me! 
 [Jake] Dad, I think Tinny was just kidnapped.

 [Jake] Tinny! Des! 
 [Mal] Tinny! Jake, we have to call the cops! 
 [Jake] No. You don't know Crocker like I do, okay? The guy thinks I ruined his life. If we call the cops, he's liable to do anything. 
 [Mal] What's that supposed to mean? 
 [Jake] I dunno. We gotta find out what he wants, and we gotta find Tinny. 
 [Rose] Hi guys. What're you doing... What's going on? 
 Malachy? 
 [Mal] Rose, sit down. Tinny and Des. S someone's taken them. 
 [Rose] Oh my God! What is that? 
 Is that a gun? Why does he... Why y does he have a gun? 
 [Mal] Rose, we have to stay calm. Just let us deal with-- 
 [Rose] Would you stop it a just tell me what the hell is going on here?! 
 [Jake] A very dangerous man has kidnapped Tinny and Des. 
 [Rose] Oh my God! 
 [Jake]Evevroroer. . W was my papanenewhenen was a a cop. Was didirty,e cacaht him. . T hehe disappeaearejust before weweade e arrest. That was 10 years ago. 
 [Rose] W wt are you gonna do? 
 [Jake] Whatever we have to. 
 [Mal] Easy, Jake. You have to keep your head through this. 
 ( cell phone ringing ) 
 [Jake] Yeah. 
 [Crocker] Above the battery. 
 Dead man's pond. 15 minutes. 
 [Jake] Let's go. 
 ♪ 
 [Tarrant] I understand you were discrete at first. You and the mayor kept your personal relationship secret? 
 [Leslie] Yes. 
 [Tarrant] Why is that? 
 [Leslie] We were being careful. 
 Taking things slow. That's all. 
 [Tarrant] Sergeant, I am here working closely with the R.N.C. 
 As a special liaison investigating the mayor. He was your-- what? Partner, boyfriend? 
 I never know what to say these days. 
 [Leslie] Obviously, I ended my personal relationship with the mayor when I arrested him. 
 [Tarrant] Of course. Did you have any previous knowledge of his, uh... dealings? 
 [Leslie] No, I did not. 
 [Tarrant] Uh-huh. Sergeant Bennett, as an investigator and an officer, you are superb. So I find it hard to believe that you didn't even suspect anything. 
 [Allison] The sergeant hasn't committed a crime. 
 [Tarrant] Thank you, councillor. 
 That's very helpful for you to point out. I didn't realize you were here representing sergeant Bennett. 
 [Leslie] Do I need one? A lawyer? 
 [Tarrant] Honestly... I don't know. 
 [Leslie] I did nothing to compromise my position as an officer. 
 [Tarrant] I sincerely hope that is the outcome of this inquiry. 
 My recommendation is going to be that you are suspended with pay until we can confirm that you are in the clear. Oh! I do hope that you come to the party the r. N.C. Is throwing this afternoon for the new mayor. 
 It'd be good for you to show your face. Send the right message. You know, optics? 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] Look, I know Crocker might want revenge on ya, but why now? 
 Why come back after all this time? 
 [Jake] Honestly, I don't know. 
 [Mal] Hey. What'd I say about a clear head? 
 [Crocker] Well! I should've known you'd bring the old man along. Every hero needs a sidekick! 
 [Jake] Where's my niece? 
 [Crocker] Wow. 10 years, not even "hello? 
" Communication skills haven't improved any. 
 [Mal] You hurt those kids, I'll take that head right off your shoulders. 
 [Crocker] You just relax, you old boot. They're just fine for now. 
 [Mal] He's hurt! 
 [Crocker] Yep! But they'll be okay for a few hours, give or take. I mean, we can only hope. 
 No heat, no food, no water. 
 [Jake] What do you want? 
 [Crocker] Phone. Now here's the thing: I hear that you've become something of a hero since I last saw you, so I thought it was time for me to check in. 
 [Jake] What do you want? 
 [Crocker] Follow me! You'll find out. Partner, you ride with me. 
 And you drive! Just like old times. God, it is so good to see you, buddy. So good! 
 ♪ 
 [Tinny] Des! 
 [Des] Ugh. 
 [Tinny] Hey, you okay? 
 [Des] Am I dead? I feel dead. Oh my God. Oh my God! 
 [Tinny] It's okay. You just hit your head. Everything's fine. 
 Well, we are kinda trapped in here alone. 
 [Des] We're alone? Like just the two of us? 
 [Tinny] Let's just try and figure out a way to get out of here, okay? 
 [Des] Wait, w-- no, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! 
 What's going on here? Who was that buddy? Are we-- are we a part of some sort of like government sting thing here or something? I mean-- ah! Do you hear that ringing in my ears? 
 [Tinny] Des! Get it together! 
 For some reason that guy locked us in here and left us. We gotta find a way outta here, so focus! 
 [Des] D'you think he's gonna come back? 
 [Tinny] Either way, it's not good. I don't think we can last in here long. We gotta find something and try and pry open the door. 
 [Crocker] Aren't you just a little, teeny bit happy to see me, bud? I mean, it's our anniversary! 
 [Jake] Anniversary? 
 [Crocker] Uh-huh. 
10 years ago this week, you ratted me out. 
 [Jake] Look, you wanna take our history on me, that's fine, but you leave my family out of it. 
 [Crocker] I had to get your attention somehow. And the thing is you do have a beautiful family. And me? What do I have? 
 [Jake] You made your choices, and I made mine. 
 [Crocker] I remember your choices. But don't worry, I figured out a way for you to make it up to me. 
 ( phone ringing ) 
 [Rose] Hello? 
 [Mal] Rose, I saw them on a video. They're alive at least. 
 It was some kind of abandoned warehouse. 
 [Rose] Okay, that's a lead, that's something. 
 [Mal] He had a take-out coffee cup in his hand. White cup with a black top. 
 [Rose] Okay, cup coffee, okay, that means he must've stopped somewhere. 
 [Mal] Which means he might be leaving a trail to where he's holding the kids. What'd you find out about Crocker? 
 [Rose] Kevin Crocker: Ex-R.N.C.; disappeared 10 years ago, charged with homicide, but he skipped out before he went to trial. 
 [Mal] That I remember. 
 [Rose] There were 2 witnesses to the murder: The victim's drug dealer boyfriend, and Jake. 
 [Crocker] I was your partner. I was your teacher. I took you under my wing. 
 [Jake] Yeah, you were real inspirational. 
 ( laughing ) 
 [Crocker] Pull up over there. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] What the hell are we doing here? 
 [Crocker] There's 20 million bucks in there, and you're gonna get me in. 
 [Jake] You've been following us? 
 [Crocker] Well, I was just looking for a good time to say "hello," but I had no idea it was gonna turn out this great. 
 You guys working for this a.T.M. 
 Outfit? That's a stroke of genius. I mean, we talk old times, I get rich. That's perfect. 
 [Jake] I hate to break this to ya, but the security in this place is to the hilt. 
 [Crocker] Phones first. I caught that call in the rear view, old man. Don't try that again. Now, I'm guessing you're as smart as I'm willing to give you credit for, but that wasn't the cops you called, no? The plan's simple. You go in, the money comes out. I've disabled the cameras, you just do what I say. 
 [Allison] This seat taken? 
 [Leslie] No. People seem to be giving me a wide berth. New mayor seems nice. 
 [Allison] I'm sorry about how that went earlier. I didn't want any part of it. 
 [Leslie] You stood up for me. I appreciate that. 
 [Allison] You know, once this investigation is over, you can get on with your life. 
 [Christian] Ladies. On the house. 
 [Allison] Thank you. 
 [Leslie] That's sweet. 
 [Christian] You guys are good for business. 
 [Leslie] Cheers. 
 [Allison] Have you seen your brother around? He said he was gonna stop in on this thing. 
 [Christian] Haven't seen him. 
 Sorry. 
 [Rose] Christian, can I talk to you for a second? 
 [Christian] Yeah, sure. 
 [Karla] Mr. Doyle, Jake. What brings you back here? 
 [Jake] I needed to, uh, talk to you about something. 
 [Karla] Well, that's good. I was hoping to see you again. 
 [Jake] Um... the cheque you gave us. It bounced. 
 [Karla] The cheque from today? 
 Are you serious? 
 [Jake] Yeah, the bank said something about a... Transit number or something? 
 [Karla] So, this isn't an excuse to see me then? 
 [Jake] No, no. The bank... 
 [Karla] Okay. 
 [Jake] I'm sorry. 
 [Karla] I see. Well, um, I'll have that fixed, and I just need to drop by accounting. 
 [Jake] Okay. I guess I'll just, uh, I'll wait here-- ( alarm ringing ) 
 [Jake] Aw, crap! I'm sorry! Was that me? 
 [Karla] It's okay. I just have to call the company. Follow me. 
 It's just a fire alarm. False alarm everyone! 
 [Jake] Karla, I'm really, really sorry about all this. 
 [Karla] Karla green! It was an accidental fire alarm. I'm entering the code now. Okay? 
 ( alarm turning off ) 
 [Jake] Uh, sorry. 
 [Karla] Don't worry about it. It takes them about 5 minutes or so to reset the system. 
 [Crocker] Okay, nobody move! 
 Whoops! You moved! Just do what you're told, and you'll all be fine. You. Ugly fella. Start bagging the money. 
 ♪ 
 [Crocker] Ladies and gentlemen, time to put the cell phones in the bag. Nobody dial 911. Now, you can keep your wallets, that's my gift to you. Eh, that's good work there, simple boy! Now why don't you move these bags out to that blue muscle car out back. If you even think about running, you will never see tinny again. You got that, right? 
 [Rose] These are all of the abandoned warehouses, storage buildings and garages within 10 minutes of our house. 
 [Christian] And you're sure that they're being held somewhere within this circle? 
 [Rose] Well, we know when Crocker took them because he was on the phone with Jake, then he called back 10 minutes later, so he couldn't have taken them much further, but I still gotta narrow this down somehow. Grab your coat, we're going for coffee. 
 [Mal] Is anyone hurt? 
 [Jake] Listen, if anything happens, you take this money and we use it as ransom for the kids. You gotta get outta here. 
 [Crocker] He's not gonna let you walk back outta there, Jake. 
 This isn't just about the money. 
 It's about getting back at you. 
 What're you gonna do? 
 [Jake] I don't know yet. 
 ( alarm ringing ) 
 [Mal] Watch yourself. 
 [Jake] Just get out of here! 
 [Crocker] Okay, why did you trigger the alarm? Is it your money? 
 [Karla] Don't. Please. 
 [Crocker] Well, you know, I can't hit a woman, so... ( Crowd gasping ) 
 [Crocker] Plan b! 
 ( crowd gasping ) 
 [Karla] The cops are on their way. 
 [Jake] Everyone just stay calm. 
 [Allison] Hey, Jake, it's me. 
 So, I'm gonna head home since you're a no-show. Can you call me? I'm not pissed or anything, but can you just call me? Okay? 
 See ya. 
 [Leslie] See ya. 
 [Tarrant] Thanks for coming, I'm glad you could make it! 
 [Leslie] Optics. 
 [Tarrant] Exactly! Look, Leslie, I'll do whatever I can to make sure that this suspension passes as quickly as possible. You're a good cop. You know that. We just wanna make sure that you're not a dirty cop. 
 [Leslie] Right. 
 ( cell phone ringing ) 
 [Tarrant] But don't hesitate to call if you need, um, anything. 
 ( multiple cell phones ringing ) 
 [hood] Looks big. Alarm triggered at a high-security location across town. Sorry you can't come, partner. 
 ( crowd muttering ) 
 [Tinny] Des, look. Up there. 
 [Des] Yeah, yeah, I think I can get to that. Although I wish I didn't cut my fingernails last night. 
 [Tinny] Maybe we should build a ladder. 
 [Des] Yeah! You're so smart! 
 It's one of the like 400 things that I admire about you. 
 [Tinny] Des, I should tell you something. 
 [Des] What? Ah, do I smell funny? I smell funny, don't I? 
 [Tinny] No... nevermind. Let's get this done, hey? Gotta get outta here before that creep comes back. 
 ♪ 
 [Leslie] Hello? Anybody home? 
 [Mal] Leslie! What brings you here? 
 [Leslie] What happened? You okay? 
 [Mal] Oh, nothing. I got locked out. Jake kicked it in. Heh, the doofus. 
 [Leslie] Do you mind if I sit with ya for a second? 
 [Mal] What's wrong? What happened? 
 [Leslie] I was, uh, just looking, I was just looking for Jake, but, uh, he wasn't in the office, and I was hoping to see him. I shouldn't-- I shouldn't have come. I didn't mean to bother you. 
 [Mal] You can tell me. What's wrong? 
 [Leslie] I'm under investigation. For conduct unbecoming of an officer. 
 [Mal] What? That's ridiculous! 
 [Leslie] The mayor, his corruption, they wanna know if I was involved. If I knew anything... 
( Sniffing ) [Leslie] What's Tarrant doing grilling Mal? 
 [Mal] It's okay, sweetheart. 
 [Leslie] I'm in love with Jake, you know that, don't ya? 
 [Mal] Yep. And he loves you too, I'd lay money on it. And I'm sure, when the time is right, when you're both a little steadier, ready, you'll find each other. 
 [Leslie] Maybe. 
 [Mal] Leslie, don't wait too long. You might just miss your chance, and I would hate for that to happen because there's no one in the world I'd rather see my boy with than you. 
 [Leslie] I appreciate it, Malachy. By the way, what's with all the hockey gear? 
 [Mal] Oh, that? Joining a beer league. 
 ♪ 
 [Tarrant] Mr. Doyle, you accidentally set off the alarm, Crocker uses that as an opportunity to get in without alerting the police, tries to rob the place, but you incapacitate him? 
 [Jake] I know. Right place wrong time, I suppose. 
 [Tarrant] Unfortunately, your heroics come after you've loaded 5 million dollars in cash into his Wheelman's getaway car. 
 Now, you didn't happen to get a good look at that fellow, did you? 
 [Jake] No, no, no. He was wearing a mask. 
 [Tarrant] Of course he was! And the camera's disabled. How are you with electronics? 
 [Jake] Well, I'm not great at programming the v. C.R. If that's what you mean. 
 [Tarrant] I want this guy Crocker. He's a bad cop on the run from murder charges for 10 years. What're you not telling me, Jake? 
 [Jake] Am I a suspect, or-- 
 [Tarrant] Should you be? 
 [Jake] Well like you said, I caught the guy, so... 
 [Tarrant] Your ex-partner. Well, it'll be interesting getting his take on things. 
 [Jake] Am I free to go here? 
 [Tarrant] You'll be hearing from me. You can count on that. 
 ♪ 
 [Christian] Uh, so we've hit 5 coffee shops already. Hey, what'd dad say that cup looked like again? 
 [Rose] Uh, white cup, black top. 
 [Christian] ( Sarcastically ) yeah, that's specific enough. 
 [Barista] Can I help you? 
 [Christian] I'll have 53 double cappuccinos to go. 
 [Rose] Okay, I have a better idea. Why don't you let me in the back so I can download some material off that security camera. 
 [Barista] Uh, I'm not really supposed to do that. 
 [Rose] Out of my way, little man. I have not got all day! You coming? 
 [Christian] You should hurry. 
 [Tarrant] How is our plucky little p. I. Connected to all this? What's this? 
 [Hood] Crocker collected all their phones. 
 [Tarrant] Look at that! 
 [Hood] Malachy Doyle. He wasn't even at the warehouse. 
 [Mal] I thought they'd book ya. 
 [Jake] No, no, no. They didn't have anything on me, but they've got Crocker. Where's the money? 
 [Mal] Stashed in the basement. Leslie was here. She almost caught me! 
 [Jake] Whoa, what was Leslie doing here? 
 [Mal] She was suspended today. 
 [Jake] Argh! What about Rose? Any luck tracking the kids? 
 [Mal] She's trying to narrow it down, but nothing definitive so far. There's no way this guy's gonna tell us where Tinny and Des are, not from jail, and not when we got his money. 
 [Jake] I know, dad. That's why we gotta call in some favours. 
 
 
 
 [Tarrant] There is a wheel man out there with $5 million. I would so like to know who that guy is. 
 [Crocker] Is that a deal I smell cooking? 
 [Tarrant] Let's start with why do you have Malachy Doyle's cell phone? He wasn't in the robby. 
 [Crocker] Well, I am a thief, you know. 
 [Tarrant] And a murderer. 
 [Crocker] Never been convicted. 
 [Tarrant] Yeah, well, you saw to that when you skipped town before it went to trial, but I really do want to hear your side of things. Who put you up to this little heist? 
 [Crocker] Well, I could tell you a story, so if you're talking deal, well, I'm listening. 
 [Walter] Excuse me, I'd like to have a word with my client please. 
 [Tarrant] Your client? 
 [Crocker] Yes? Sure. The tubby guy there? That's my lawyer. 
 What's your name? 
 [Walter] Walter. 
 [Crocker] Walter! 
 [Walter] Yeah, if you could excuse us, please? 
 [Crocker] Hey, Wally! 
 [Walter] Let's not get too chummy. I'm just the messenger here. Jake Doyle wants Tinny and Des' location, and then you can have your money. 
 ( laughing ) 
 [Crocker] All right, look. You tell Jake Doyle that if he wants to see his niece alive, he has about one option, break me outta here. 
 [Walter] Did you get that? 
 [Jake] Tell him he's got a deal. 
 ♪ 
 [Rose] Hey, you guys, look! 
 Check this out. 
 [Mal] It's Crocker! 
 [Rose] Yeah. So, he grabbed the kids from our house, and then he stopped here to get a coffee before he went to the battery, so he's got them somewhere here. 
 He took our warehouses from 100 to 7. I can go to each one of them. 
 [Jake] Great. You stay on that. 
 If you find the kids first, we call it off. Otherwise we stick to the plan. Or at least I do. 
 [Mal] We'll have to snatch him when they move him to the courthouse for the arraignment. 
 You need to know when that's gonna happen. 
 [Jake] I'm on it. 
 [Tarrant] Knock knock! 
 [Jake] I guess this time I leave in a set of bracelets, what? 
 [Tarrant] Malachy Doyle, would you mind having a little chat? 
 Down at the station? 
 [Rose] Mal? 
 [Mal] It's okay. Do what needs to be done. 
 [Tarrant] Sorry for interrupting! 
 [Jake] You two, find the warehouses, all right? I'll go after Crocker. 
 [Christian] No, no, no, no, no. 
 I'm going with you. 
 [Jake] Fine. Just call us if you find them, okay? 
 [Rose] Okay. 
 [Allison] Hey. 
 [Jake] Hi, Allison, I can't talk right now. 
 [Allison] What's going on? Where have you been? I've been calling you all day. 
 [Jake] Yeah, uh, I'm sorry. I should've got back to you. It's just... I can't do this right now. 
 [Allison] Jake, look, this isn't about me being clingy. I just think that I deserve an explanation as to why you've been ignoring me. 
 [Jake] I'm not ignoring you! 
 We're just... we're in the middle of something big here, and I can't get into it. 
 [Allison] That's not good enough. Where are you going? 
 [Jake] I'm sorry, Allison, but I can't have this conversation right now. Christian, let's go. 
 [Rose] Um, it's not what you think. 
 [Allison] Yes, it is, I think. 
 Unfortunately. 
 [Des] All right, that's the last one, so I'll head up. It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine. I'm gonna get us outta here, okay? 
 [Tinny] I'm lighter, and a little less spaz-like. 
 [Des] No, no, no! No, no-- ( glass breaking ) 
 [Des] Look, I have a job here, okay? To help you for you. Okay? 
 [Tinny] Okay! Fine. You n n save me. Go ahead! 
 [Des] Okay. And Tinny, I want you to know that if things get worse, I don't want you to starve, so if you have to, you can eat my corpse, okay? 
 [Tinny] Shut up. 
 [Des] Now I'll just... I'll get us out of here. 
 [Tinny] I'm going to London. I should've told you. I wanted to, but... anyway, I'm going. 
 [Des] Why? 
 [Tinny] Poppy said he's got enough money, and I get to go for a year. 
 [Des] A year? Like a whole year? 
 [Tinny] I was gonna tell y-- 
 [Des] No, no, no, it's fine. 
 It's fine. That's... I bet it's a good school. 
 [Tinny] Des. 
 [Des] No, no. I'm happy. I'm really happy. So, I'll just get us outta here, so you can go. 
 [Tinny] Careful. 
 [Des] Ow! 
 [Tinny] Oh my God! Is it okay? 
 [Des] I think it's broken! I think it's broken! Ow! 
 [Tarrant] 10 years ago, Crocker killed a girl in front of her drug-dealing boyfriend and another cop, but I read an interesting obituary from last week. A drug-dealing witness is dead. 
 [Mal] That's fascinating. What's it have to do with me? 
 [Tarrant] That's one witness down, only one to go. Your son? 
 Now, Jake is suddenly at the scene of Crocker's latest criminal endeavour, and your cell phone turns up in the evidence box, but you say that you were at home cleaning the kitchen. 
 [Mal] I've become a bit more domestic in the last few months. 
 Place was a sty. 
 [Tarrant] Why would Crocker have your cell phone on him when we picked him up? 
 [Mal] Jake likes to call the s*x lines, expects me to pay for I must've come outta his pocket. 
 [Tarrant] Does that look familiar? 
 [Mal] I've always been more for curling myself. Wish I could help ya. 
 [Tarrant] I bet you do. I bet you do. 
 [Hood] You've missed me, haven't ya?

 [Hood] Bennett, it's only an active duty suspension. You don't need to clear our your locker. 
 [Hood] Look, you're not doing yourself any favours by being here. 
 [Leslie] Where'd that hockey bag come from. 
 [Hood] Crocker used it to stuff the money in with the cash warehouse job. 
 [Leslie] Crocker? 
 [Hood] Kevin Crocker. Jake's old partner. Things, they don't look good here. 
 [Jake] Look, Walter, I wouldn't ask if I had any other choices. 
 I really need your help. 
 [Walter] Look, if I knew where they were transferring Crocker, I'd tell ya, you know I would. 
 Only cops get that kind of info. 
 I'm gonna keep trying. 
 [Jake] No, it's fine, don't worry about it, buddy. I'll figure it out. 
 ( sighing ) 
 [Jake] I'm sorry, Leslie.

 [Prostitute] Another 15 and I can pretend to be a cop in private. 
 [Jake] No, I'm... I'm good, thanks.

 Let's just hope Rose finds them before it's too late. Go on, get in.

 [Crocker] That's one hell of a stunt you pulled back there! 
 It's always good to know that you can rely upon your friends! 
 Heh. 
 [Jake] Where's my niece? 
 [Crocker] You seem kind of agitated. I dunno, was it something I said, or-- 
 [Jake] Tell me where she is or I'll kill ya! 
 [Crocker] The thing is, if you kill me, you'll never find her. 
 Lads, now look, you got very little time left. You got even less negotiating power. You get me the money, you get the brats. 
 It's simple. 
 [Jake] You bring me to where she is, I see she's okay? Then Christian will bring you the money. 
 [Crocker] Buddy, how bout you let me work out the details? 
 Your brother stays with me, you go get the money. 
 [Jake] No way. 
 [Christian] Let's do what he says, Jake. 
 [Jake] No. 
 [Crocker] He's always such a control freak. Give me the firearm. The gun, or your niece will rot. I'll call ya. Hurry. I think your brother's gotta learn how to relax. 
 [Christian] Let's just do this, eh? 
 [Des] Are you sure I shouldn't eat any of the salt beef? 
 [Tinny] We don't have any water, so I don't think you should eat 20 year old salt beef. Save your energy. 
 [Des] When did you decide to move to London? Because it's just so far away, you know? 
 Like, Corner Brook is close. St. John's is even closer. 
 [Tinny] We live in St. John's. 
 And going far away is kinda the idea. 
 [Des] I guess so, it's just... I guess I was just surprised, you know, because London England is like in England, which is not even north America, and no one will be there except for you. Is it me? Because I could move to London and you could stay if you want. 
 [Tinny] No! It's not you. I need to go for me. I'm sorry, but I do. 
 [Des] I dunno, Tinny. I just, I just feel like-- 
 [Tinny] It's okay, it's okay. I know. I feel it too. 
 [Tarrant] Look, I like Jake. I think he has wonderful potential and ability. But if he is involved, he will have a very different future than I would've hoped for the boy. 
 [Mal] Really? 
 [Tarrant] A different future for you, too. 
 [Mal] My future is not in my own hand right now, and I'd kill someone to change that. 
 ( knocking ) 
 [Tarrant] Who's that, your lawyer? 
 [Rose] If you don't mind, I would like to have a word with my husband alone. Maybe talk some sense into him. It's time to face reality. 
 [Tarrant] Fine. Fine! I just hope that you are a Doyle who can see reason. 
 [Mal] Did you find them? 
 [Rose] Not yet, but I know how we will. Conroy. 
 [Mal] Dan, what're you doing? 
 You could lose your job for this! 
 [Conroy] Rose filled me in. I'd rather do a little more moose hunting anyway. I leave you to it. 
 [Mal] Thanks, man. 
 [Rose] Thank you. 
 [Mal] What're you doing? 
 [Rose] Okay, this is Crocker's phone. The link to the live feed will still be in its history. 
 Look! Oh my God, Mal! Des is hurt! 
 [Mal] Looks bad. Worse than before. What's that in the foreground? Is that a beef bucket? 
 [Rose] I don't know, I can't read the label. 
 [Mal] I recognize it. It says "trimmed naval beef." That company went under years ago. 
 ( sighing ) 
 [Mal] There's an old packing plant down on water street. 
 That's the place! 
 [Rose] Checking it out! 
 [Mal] Go! 
 [Leslie] What the hell do you think you're doing? 
 [Jake] Ah. Leslie, your timing for hiding in my living room and pointing a gun at me couldn't be worse if you tried. 
 [Leslie] This is not a joke, Jake. You're in a lot of trouble. 
 [Jake] I can see that. 
 [Leslie] You're under arrest. 
 [Jake] Well, technically, you're suspended. 
 [Leslie] On your knees, now. 
 [Jake] Leslie, I don't have time for this. Tinny and Des have been kidnapped. 
 [Leslie] What are you talking about? 
 [Jake] And I've only got a few hours to get 'em back. 
 [Leslie] Jake, this is crazy. 
 Are you telling me the truth? 
 [Jake] I don't even know if Tinny's still alive, but I am going to find her. I have to. 
 And if the cops are involved, that guy... He'll kill her, and trust me, I know him. He'll do it. 
 [Leslie] This is not the way to fix this, Jake. I'm making you come with me. 
 [Jake] That's not gonna happen.

 [Crocker] Hey-hey, hero! I was wondering when you were gonna show up! Drop the cash. 
 [Jake] We both know this has nothing to do with cash. It's about what happened 10 years ago. 
 [Crocker] Well, it's about both, really. 
 [Jake] You all right? 
 [Christian] I'm fine.

 [Crocker] Money! 
 [Jake] I can't believe that you're blaming me for this. 
 After all these years? You're the one who killed that girl. 
 That was your decision all on your own. 
 [Crocker] But you're the one that turned me in. You turned me in for a junkie. She was nothing. I did this town a favour when I killed her. 
 [Jake] You keep telling yourself that, Crocker. You're a piece of crap, plain and simple. You were taking money from drug dealers, man. You're a crook. You were the biggest crook in town. 
 [Crocker] Ooh, and you're the big hero! Bringing down the mayor! Getting his picture in the paper! Saving the citizenry! 
 [Jake] You wanna kill me because I got my picture in the paper? 
 [Crocker] No. I wanted to kill you for a long time. I just needed something to get me off the couch. You know, last little push. 
 [Jake] What now? 
 [Crocker] Well, I'm gonna take the money, I'm gonna be gone. 
 And as for you...

 [Leslie] Don't tempt me. 
 [Hood] C'mon, Doyle. Come on. 
 Take it easy. 
 [Tarrant] Well, it's been quite an eventful day for you. Foiled an armed robbery, recovered the stolen money, took down a fugitive. 
 [Jake] Well, you can get a lot done when you're motivated. 
 [Tarrant] You know that, uh, I can't charge you with any crime. 
 There's no hard evidence. You pulled this off perfectly. 
 [Jake] Accusations are certainly not appreciated. So, am I good to go here, or... [Tarrant] Sure! Too bad your father isn't. 
 [Jake] What? 
 [Tarrant] Well, you I have nothing on, but Malachy? I think I could build a pretty compelling case. 
 [Jake] What do you want? Is this a joke? 
 [Tarrant] Some people might think so, but I'm deadly serious. St. John's is moving towards major organised crime. 
 The R.N.C.'S well on top of it, but I'm starting up a special task force, and I want you to head it. 
 [Jake] I'm not interested. 
 [Tarrant] Ah, no, you don't get it. This is not an offer. It's an ultimatum. Either you pay for your actions by helping me, or... [Jake] Or? 
 [Tarrant] Or I proceed with charges against your father to the full extent of the resources available to me. He may end up in the clear, but it won't be an easy ride for him. Think about that. We could use you. Your city could use you. Try not being selfish for once in your life.

 [Jake] I think I know what that means. You sure about this, skipper? 
 [Mal] Orson Welles once said, "if you want a happy ending, you need to know when to end your story." 
 [Jake] Yeah, but dad, it's not exactly like you're dying or anything. 
 [Mal] That's kinda the point. 
 [Jake] Are you sure that you're sure? 
 [Mal] Nope, but I think it's time. I'm lucky to have you. 
 It's been a hell of a ride. 
 [Jake] Cheers to that.

 [Jake] Well, he's all yours. You should be very careful, because he's a real crooked arse, especially around noon. 
 [Rose] Um, so... [Mal] Yeah. Think it's time to call it in. So what do you say? 
 You wanna take a real long vacation with me? 
 [Rose] Yes. Hey, what about you? 
 What're you gonna do?
