 [Narrator] Previously on Republic of Doyle... 
 [Jake] What about later, we hook up after work and have a little, uh, whiskey tasting? 
 [Leslie] Get it through your skull, I don't like you. 
 [Jake] Liar. 
 [Des] Thoughts, questions, concerns? 
 [Chandra] Des, I'm just super busy. 
 [Rose] It's okay Dessie. 
 She likes you. 
 [Des] Yeah, no. Yeah, she's crazy about me. 
 [Des] I'm screwed. Chandra's totally over me. With Jake she's, like, laughing and she's paying attention to his Alpha pheromones. 
 [Chandra] I've seen his type before. 
 [Kathleen] We were dating. 
 I found out he was married. 
 [Rose] Tell me what you wanna do. 
 [Tammy] You stay away from will! 
 [Tinny] Can you clean up your mess? Please? 
 [Leslie] We both know what's best here, and it doesn't involve you and me walking off into the sunset together. We need to back off. 
 [Jake] You sure about that? 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] Shoulda got Des to do this. 
 [Jake] I don't see you over here. 
 (Zap!) 
 [Jake] (Scream) 
 [Mal] (Laugh) 
 [Mal] Oh wow. That's actually pretty clear. I take it back. 
 Nice work. 
 [Jake] Why are we doing this stupid worker's comp case anyway? 
 [Mal] Money, to make a living, to pay the bills, moron. 
 [Jake] Clyde cowley? 
 "Dime-bag Clyde"? 
 I knew this guy in high school. 
 This is our worker's comp case? 
 [Mal] Oh, I remember. You were always jealous of him. It was embarrassing. 
 [Jake] I wasn't jealous of him, Clyde was a-- a total jerk, especially to Walter. 
 [Mal] You were in love with his girlfriend. 
 [Jake] I wasn't in love with her. She was just very... very attractive. Clyde and I, we had this kind of fight-on-sight clause. 
 [Jake] Whiplash? everything, you know? A baseball scholarship, he was Mr. athlete. 
 He got all the girls. 
 [Mal] Yeah, well that was then. 
 Now his finances are in the toilet, injuries. He's going through a rough time. 
 [Jake] Is he still with Jessica? 
 [Mal] As far as I know. Vulture. 
 [Jake] I'm not a vulture, dad. 
 She's just super hot. 
 (Car door shutting) 
 [Mal] There he goes. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Man, he looks like crap. 
 [Mal] Whatever he's at, the whiplash isn't hindering it. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Are you seeing this? 
 [Jake] Uh, dad... (Commotion) 
 [Jake] Clyde! 
 (Scaffold rattling) 
 [Jake] I'll cut him down, dad. 
 [Clyde] (Thud) 
 [Mal] 911? We have an emergency.

 [Clyde] What the... What... What am I doing here? 
 [Jake] Just take it easy. 
 [Mal] You had an accident Clyde. 
 [Clyde] Oh wait a minute, wait a minute! 
 Hey, didn't I go to high school with you? 
 Yeah, you hung out with that loser fat kid. 
 (Laughs) 
 [Jake] His name is Walter, and he was big-boned. 
 I'm Jake, and this is my father, Malachy. 
 [Mal] Clyde, were you trying to kill yourself? 
 [Clyde] What? No. No, no. 
 Kill myself, no. 
 Suicide. 
 (Groan) 
 Suicide... that's just-- That's not me, so... - Easy there. Easy. 
 The doctor tells us you're fine, but you need to rest. 
 [Clyde] Who asked you, anyways? 
 I'm fine, so... You guys can just go away now. 
 [Mal] Hey son, hold up. 
 If you were trying to kill yourself, we could have you taken into custody, so, uh, why don't you just tell us what's going on? 
 [Clyde] (Groaning) 
 Okay, look Jake, since high school I haven't exactly been carrying on as the guy I was. 
 [Jake] Really, I-- 
I hadn't noticed? 
 [Clyde] I am a winner. I had a good job, a house, a marriage, then a few months ago everything went a little snaky. 
 [Jake] Oh yeah? 
 [Clyde] I lost my job, couldn't find work. It was like after spending my whole life on top, suddenly I was cursed. 
 [Jake] Well, you know, you still have-- You still have Jessica, right? 
 [Clyde] That's true. 
 [Jake] She was like the hottest thing in high school... 
 [Jessica] Why am I still listed as your next of kin? We're divorced, remember? Do you understand that? Divorced? 
 [Clyde] Not yet, we're not. 
 [Jessica] Well, we will be soon. 
 Trust me. 
 [Jake] Hi, Jessica, how ya doing? Remember me? Jake Doyle, from high school? 
 [Walter] Jess, I told you not to talk to him until after the settlement. 
 [Jessica] Yeah, I know Wally. 
 Just-- just give us a second. 
 [Walter] (Stutter) 
 [Jake] Wally? 
 [Walter] I'm repping her in the divorce. She's an old friend. 
 I'm doing her a favour. 
 [Jake] A fa-- A favour. 
 Yeah, I bet. 
 [Mal] Hey, boys, boys. Jake has issues with seeing other people happy. 
 [Walter] Yeah, okay, so I know there's a little bit of a history there between me and Jess, that's true. 
 [Jake] A history? Yeah, yeah. 
 In your fantasy, lad. 
 [Walter] Hey, we had chemistry, okay? 
 [Jessica] Wally? 
 Let's go. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Nice seeing you again, Jessica. 
 [Mal] She's playing hard to get. 
 Just... - Look, uh, fellas. I lied. We're a little divorced. 
 [Jake] A little? 
 [Clyde] I need to get my wife back. I need your help. I need-- 
 I need to save my life. 
 ♪ 
 [Rose] So you two are getting along really well, hey? 
 [Des] Well, it's easy because Chandra has some seriously super-human qualities. 
 [Chandra] Des, stop it. 
 [Des] No, no, it's true. She's a brilliant swimmer and, uh, she has to eat all over her food... Proportionately. Like, like, in proportion. 
 (Coughing) 
 [Des] And ladies, that's why I garden, to keep the stress levels in check. 
 [Tinny] Right on. 
 [Chandra] Uh, how-- how are you, Tinny? How's, um, high school? 
 [Tinny] Just fine. Thank you for asking. 
 [Chandra] That's great. You know, I remember when I was in high school. God, it feels like so long ago. What grade are you in again? 10? 
 [Tinny] 12, actually. 
 [Chandra] Oh, good, good. It's a special year. I hope you enjoy it. My grade 12 year I just had to cram and cram to get into pre-med, you know? 
 [Des] (Laughs) 
 [Tinny] Well, isn't she all that and a bag of chips? 
 [Des] Well, Tinny is an awesome student. I mean, she gets wicked marks without even studying. 
 [Chandra] Oh. Good for her. 
 [Tinny] Who's the extreme sport enthusiast? 
 [Chandra] Oh, ours. Des and I. 
 [Des] Just a little fun with the ol' shuttlecock. 
 [Rose] So, okay, yeah. I'm going to go to work now and go to the office. Why don't you come help me, Tinny? 
 [Tinny] No, I'm od a actually. 
 [Des] Why don't we have a three-way? 
 [Rose] (Spit!) 
 [Chandra] What? 
 I-- I mean with badminton, badminton, uh... - Des? No. 
 [Des] No? Okay, ok, I meant with badminton! I-- I-- Anyway, I'm sorry. No? Okay, I'm good. 
 Okay. 
 ♪ 
 [Rose] Bye... for now. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Do you wanna tell us what the hell are we doing here? 
 [Clyde] Yeah, I just want to see the bank guy, you two are PIs, right? 
 So I'm hiring you. 
 [Jake] You ever hear of a cheque? 
 [Mal] Look Clyde, we can talk about payment later. We just need a little info from you about what it is you think we can do to help. 
 [Jake] And, you know, why maybe you tried to hang yourself. 
 [Clyde] Look, I told you that was an accident. I just-- I need to talk to this guy. He's, he-- he sort of foreclosed on my house earlier than he should have and I-- I... Oh, oh, there he is! Hey, Vallis! 
 [Vallis] - Yeah... 
 [Clyde] - Great to see you again. 
 Clyde... Clyde cowley. 
 [Vallis] Hmm. 
 [Clyde] You ripped off my house, remember? 
 [Clyde] You... you... Traitorous piece of poo! 
 [Jake] - Clyde, just... just... 
 [Vallis] - Hey! Stay away from me. 
 And this bank, or you'll end up in jail, you hear me? 
 [Mal] What the? 
 [Jake] Uh... Clyde? 
 [Mal] I think he's snoring. 
 [Clyde] (Snoring) 
 [Mal] Clyde. 
 [Jake] (Snap) 
 [Mal] You fell asleep standing up. 
 [Clyde] I am just exhausted. 
 [Des] That's a bad sign. Let me get my equipment. Just... 
 [Clyde] I think Jeff Vallis, the banker, foreclosed on my house because he's sleeping with Jessica. 
 [Jake] Do you have any proof? 
 [Clyde] No. But he's trying to make me look like a loser to get her away from me. That's why I-- 
I-- I-- I need to get the house back, for Jessica. To-- to show her that I can. 
 [Mal] What would make you think that Jessica's fooling around on you with Vallis? 
 [Jake] Yeah. 
 [Clyde] I don't know. It's like the minute we started dealing with that guy from the bank she changed. You know? Vallis shows up and Jess wants me spending more and more. Nothing's good enough for her. I kept remortgaging the house just to keep up. 
 [Mal] And then Vallis forecloses. 
 [Clyde] I couldn't make the payments. But Vallis, he told me he would hold off, but he lied to me. I feel like they were both playing me, you know, because first I lose the house, and then Jessica, she wants a divorce. 
 [Jake] Dad and I-- Or I will, we'll just go talk to Jessica. 
 [Clyde] No. No, no. 
 Don't do that. 
 She'll know something's up. 
 [Mal] I'm sure she will. 
 [Jake] Trust us. 
 This is our job. 
 [Des] Okay. So, drowsiness in stressful situations, uh, over-exertion, bed-wetting, fear, fight-or-flight instincts, fear of thumbtacks, flying, driving, walking or water, those are all serious, serious symptoms. 
 [Clyde] I-- I have to catch up with Malachy. 
 [Des] Ah, ah, it is in my humble opinion that you have a medical condition that you need to see a physician about. Or a med student, and that can be arranged. 
 [Clyde] What are you talking about? 
 [Des] You, sir, are a text-book narcoleptic. 
 [Clyde] Don't be ridiculous. 
 [Des] Hey, no... hey, no! 
 You're in no condition to drive! 
 Get a cab! 
 You're in no condition... ah! 
 [Mal] I know he was your arch enemy in high school, but you really have to stop enjoying Clyde's suffering so much. 
 [Jake] Look, okay? He was a terror to everyone, dad, okay? 
 He picked on Walter every chance that he got. I can't help but think that this whole thing, you know, it might be karma. 
 [Mal] Yeah, well watch yourself. 
 There's plenty of karma to go around. Clyde's luxury apartment. 
 [Jake] (Laughing) 
 He ended up living in his car. 
 I gotta say, that's perfect. 
 That's what you call karma. 
 [Mal] Starting to see your future? 
 (Laughs) 
 [Jake] Very funny. 
 [Mal] Someone leaving newspapers around. 
 (Dirt bike revving) 
 [Jake] They're all the sa-- ♪ 
 [Mal] See? Karma. 
 [Jake] Very funny. 
 [Jake] What is this? 
 ♪ 
 [Chili] Jake and Malachy Doyle. 
 [Jake] Who are you? 
 [Chili] Ah. A man who doesn't waste any time. I respect that. 
 Your, uh, client is in debt to me. 
 [Mal] What are you talking about? What debt? 
 [Chili] It's a considerable amount. Even in this province's robust economy. So, do I now look to you for compensation? 
 [Jake] Us? Uh, no, b'y. 
 [Mal] How much? 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Chili] You ask Clyde how much. 
 [Jake] Who was pony-tail buddy? 
 [Mal] No idea, but I think we'd better find out. 
 [Clyde] Just put it on Jake Doyle's tab. 
 [Chili] Hey dead-beat. I want to talk to you. 
 [Clyde] I-- I-- I'll get it back to you, I promise. 
 [Chili] You bet you will. So as you don't forget... 
 [Jake] Ay, whoa, whoa, what do you think you're doing here? 
 [Chili] Don't worry. 
 Message sent. 
 [Jake] Clyde, you want to tell us what you got on the go with this guy? 
 [Clyde] He thinks I robbed him or something. I don't know. 
 [Mal] Yeah, right. Of course. 
 [Jessica] What is going on? 
 Are you stalking me? 
 [Jake] Hi Jessica. 
 [Clyde] Jess, honey, don't be like that now. 
 [Jessica] Don't call me "honey". 
 [Clyde] The boys are just helping me finish renoing the house, you see? We were gonna keep it pretty for you. 
 [Jessica] Clyde, we don't own the house anymore, remember? The bank foreclosed when you stopped paying the mortgage? I'm lucky they're letting me stay until the end of the month. 
 [Jake] Uh, far be it for me to interject, but don't you think maybe that you might be just... Slightly being a li-- a little-- a little bit hard on him? 
 [Jessica] Look creep, I don't remember you, okay? So drop it. 
 And you, do I need a restraining order? Clyde, the past is just that. The past. Best you left it behind you and moved on. I have. 
 ♪ 
 [Des] Oh, uh, the name's Chili Power. 
 [Jake] Chili powder? 
 [Mal] Power. 
 His Christian name's Liam. 
 [Jake] Liam Power. 
 How do I know that name? 
 [Des] I think Clyde's a narcoleptic. 
 [Mal] Des? 
 [Des] So, Chili's from around the bay originally, and he made some major money our in fort Mac and now he's home, and he's lending out on the street. 
 [Mal] - So, guesses are... 
 [Jake] - Clyde owes him money. 
 Man... oh, how did I get us roped into helping this sad-sack of a fella? 
 [Mal] He needs our help, and you have a natural inclination to help people. 
 [Jake] I don't get it. 
 Where's the joke? 
 [Mal] There isn't one. 
 You're a good boy, Jake. Now... Go help your high school enemy. 
 [Des] (Slurping) 
 [Clyde] I guess it all just comes down to bad luck, you know? 
 [Jake] Or it could be the fact that you've never had to work for anything, and you've been a dick to everyone for your entire life. 
 [Clyde] Alright. I was a jerk. 
 At times. But I was just better than everyone else. Everything I touched turned to gold. You try living with that. 
 [Jake] Yeah, it must be tough living in your own shadow. 
 [Clyde] Do you remember how good I was at baseball? I was the only player in this province to get a baseball scholarship. 
 [Jake] Why didn't you go? 
 [Clyde] Jess wanted me to stay. 
 Couldn't live without me. 
 Now she doesn't even love me anymore. 
 [Jake] How much do you owe Chili? 
 [Clyde] 100 grand. 
 Plus the juice. 
 [Jake] Oh great. 
 [Clyde] I just-- I needed a little bit, just to get by, and... I lost it all. 
 [Jake] Poker? 
 [Clyde] No, I literally lost it. 
 It was stolen, or-- or-- or lost, or whatever. 
 [Jake] How did you misplace $100,000? 
 [Clyde] I... I got home and I saw Jessica with another man... Vallis. 
 I'm sure it was him. 
 I got nervous and... Had an episode. 
 I get sleepy whenever I'm nervous, or excited, or angry, or upset. 
 [Jake] Des was right. 
 You're a narcoleptic. 
 [Clyde] Whatever. I-- I fell asleep, passed out on the lawn, woke up and the money was gone. 
 I think that Jessica has my money and she's hiding it in the house. 
 [Jake] Alright, let's go to your house and we'll get it back, okay? 
 [Clyde] Really? You'd do that for me? 
 [Jake] I'm actually doing it for myself, because I-- I just really... I-- I don't want to deal with you anymore. 
 [Clyde] Vallis ruined my life. 
 [Jake] Oh yeah, Vallis is the problem here. Sure. 
 [Clyde] From the minute we met him... Vallis! Fancy suits and words. Vallis. He's the one that told me to remortgage the house, he forecloses on me! 
 [Jake] Are you even looking for the money here, or... 
 [Clyde] Just gotta make sure there's no new man-stuff here. 
 [Jake] Clyde, focus, okay? Where would your wife hide $100,000? 
 [Clyde] The safe.

 [Walter] What are you helping him for anyway? He was such a dick-smack to us in high school. 
 Oh! (Laughs) 
 You remember that time that he beat me up and he stole my pants and my underwear? 
 [Jake] Shh! You weren't wearing any underwear.

 Was it him? I bet it was him. 
 I know it was him!

 [Clyde] Walter? 
 "Walter the falter"? 
 No worries of her stepping out with him. 
 The fatty. 
 [Jake] You just watch yourself Clyde. 
 [Clyde] Why? 
 We gonna fight again? 
 Like in high school? 
 [Mal] Whoa, whoa, settle down boys. 
 [Jake] I wouldn't worry about it dad. For Clyde's sake I don't think that's a good idea, and-- 
 [Clyde] - Wait a minute! When I passed out, she was undressing. 
 Did you see her naked? 
 Did you see her naked?! 
 [Jake] No, b'y. She, um... 
(Clears throat) 
 ...Went to the bathroom. 
 [Mal] We gotta figure out this situation with Chili. 
 He's a dangerous one. 
 [Clyde] Ah, don't worry about him. I'll deal with him. We need to deal with Vallis. 
 [Mal] What's his, uh, connection to Jessica? 
 [Clyde] He wants into her awesome pants. 
 [Jake] He works as a loan officer at the bank and Jessica has a meeting with him at 10:00 this morning. 
 [Clyde] Maybe she wants to renegotiate, get the house back! 
 [Mal] It'd be good to have ears on the inside. 
 [Jake] Yeah. 
 (Snap) 
 We should send someone in undercover, you know, to plant a bug. Maybe, uh, two kids posing as a young couple looking to buy a new home? 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Okay, that's the lapel camera, alright? Put it somewhere where we can't see it, Des. That's the idea. And this is a bug, alright? You need to plant it, because I need to hear whatever is going on in Vallis' office after you leave. Put it on his desk, briefcase, whatever. 
 [Des] Okay, okay, but-- but... Me-- me and Tinny? I mean, really? Don't you think that's kind of dangerous? I mean, we're not really in a good place right now if we're looking for a house together. 
 [Jake] Tinny's in the bank waiting for you right now. 
 [Des] Just wait. Don't get mad at me. I've been waiting to talk to you about this. 
 I think Tinny hates me. 
 [Jake] Of course she hates you. 
 [Des] She does? 
 Did she say anything to you? 
 Did she say anything? 
 [Jake] So, I fixed Des with a lapel camera and it should be coming through right... now. 
 [Mal] Bang up job again. 
 [Clyde] Will we be finding out if Jess and Vallis are having an affair now or not? 
 [Jake] They're not, okay? But we think that Jess, your wife, is stealing your money. 
 [Mal] But if your wife went on a spending spree just before you lost the house... 
 Maybe she owes Vallis money. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Clyde] Or maybe Vallis made her steal my 100g's. 
 [Jake] Hello? 
 [Walter] We need to talk right now. 
 [Jake] Yeah, now's not a very good time. 
 [Jake] - It was-- oh, hey! Look.

 Don't freak out. 
 [Des] Okay, um, alright so, so do we have a plan? I mean, wha-- what's the plan? We should have a plan. Was I supposed to have the plan? 
 [Tinny] - Des-- 
 [Vallis] - Oh yeah. Hold on a sec. 
 [Tinny] Mr. Vallis, I'm sorry we don't have an appointment, but can we just have a minute of your time? 
 [Vallis] Call you back. 
 [Tinny/des] (Kiss) 
 [Tinny] I think it's the right thing for us to buy a house. 
 Don't you, honey? 
 [Vallis] So, uh, what can I do for you kids? 
 [Tinny] Well, we're not exactly kids. I'm in med school, which makes me a bit of a dick, but we're in love so we just wanna start looking at houses. That's what you specialize in, right? 
 Houses, mortgages? 
 [Vallis] Well, first thing's first. Are you here for pre-approval or do you property in mind? 
 [Tinny] Oh I've got a property in mind. Des, are you sure you wanna get all settled in with a med student, buy a house, have little med student babies? 
 [Des] Oh my God, oh my God.

 [Mal] Oh dear. 
 [Clyde] What in God's name is she doing? 
 [Tinny] Oh my God. You'd better go get one of those allergy needle pens or he will die right here.

 [Jake] Tell that to your back. 
 [Des] What was all that back there? I mean, I mean are you jealous or something of me and Chandra? I mean, I'm really confused, and why'd you make him stab me three times?
