 [Narrator] Previously, on Republic of Doyle. 
 [Ronnie] 4 grand Doyle, that's 2 months ago. 
 [Jake] I was gonna pay you back, Ronnie. 
 [Leslie] Mayor Jack, this is Jake Doyle. 
 [Christian] I had a deal to open a bar with my brother and at the last minute I got claustrophobic and I panicked. 
 [Jake] I invested $4,000 in that bar, and it all disappeared when you decided to run away from home, like a teenage girl. 
 [Mal] Move out of my house! 
 [Jake] Listen here, I'll move out when I'm good and ready. 
 [Mal] Are you livin' here? I threw you outta the house thinkin' you'd find an apartment, not move into our new office. 
 [Allison] Haven't seen you in a couple days. How about a bite? 
 [Jake] Depends on what kinda bite you're talkin' about? 
 [Mal] Hello. 
 [Allison] I, uh, have to... 
 [Allison and Jake] Go to court. 
 [Allison] It was nice seeing you. Thanks for lunch. 
 [Rose] Wanna get hitched? 
 [Mal] Yeah! 
 [Rose] Cool! 
 [Jake] This is my family. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Yes, I know. I know. 
 [Mal] We have a job, remember? 
 The funeral. 
 [Jake] All right. Just, you know, would you give me a few minutes, all right? 
 [Allison] Are you planning on getting your own apartment anytime soon? 
 [Jake] Uh, hold on... You look amazing. 
 [Allison] Jake, I'm serious about your apartment. 
 [Jake] Yeah, I guess I'm supposed to be a grown man, right? 
 [Mal] Hello? Jake? 
 [Jake] Dad, why don't you give me um... 
10 minutes, I gotta jump in the shower. You know what, make it half an hour, 45 minutes. 
 [Priest] In the name of God, Jacob protector. May he send you helpful sanctuary and grant you support from Zion and may he remember all your sacrifices. 
 [Mal] It's a funeral, have some respect. Pete Ryan was a friend of the family. 
 [Jake] Sorry. I'll throw it away. 
 [Mal] Pete Ryan was lost at sea. 
 [Jake] Portrait was a nice touch. He was a handsome fella. 
 [M[Mal] Here's Kimberly. 
 [Kimberly] Malachy. Hi, Jake. 
 [Jake] Kim, I'm so sorry for your loss. 
 [Kimberly] It always takes a funeral to see old friends, right? 
 [Mal] Kim, your father was a great friend. He'll be missed. 
 [Jake] Anything that we can do to help. Anything at all, you can just tell us, okay? 
 You're family. So... 
[Kimberly] I called you because... something isn't sitting right about dad's death. 
 I just, I can't seem to shake this, um, uneasy feeling. 
 [Mal] What do you mean by "uneasy"? 
 ( phone ringing ) 
 [Jake] Uh, I am so, so sorry. 
 [Mal] Turn that thing off. 
 [Jake] I have to take this. Hi. 
 [Allison] I meant to mention to you, I'm gonna need you for a deposition. 
 [Jake] A legal deposition, that's really hot. 
 [Allison] Yeah, on the Parsons case. And I wanna meet with you first because we need to go through it. 
 [Jake] Okay, sure. Meet me at my place at um, I don't know, 8:00, maybe? 
 [Allison] Did you leave me keys? 
 [Jake] To... my apartment. 
 They're over by the... by the sink. 
 [Allison] Are you okay with me having keys? 
 [Jake] Uh... yeah. Uh, yeah... 
 [Allison] Okay, eat. I'll see ya tonight. 
 [Jake] Really sorry about that. 
 [Gordie] You're bringin' that up here? The man's dead. He's gone. 
 Just leave it alone! 
 [Reg] $50,000 is no joke! 
 [Alex] Hey, leave him alone. 
 [Kimberly] Here's what I'm talking about, right there. The. 
 Pittmans. They were my father's partners on the crab boat. The. 
 Pittmans... [Alex] Don't talk to my father that way. 
 [Kimberly] They're a tangly bunch, sometimes. 
 [Jake] What do you mean? 
 [Kimberly] I think one of them murdered my dad. 
 ( shouting ) 
 [Alex] Don't speak to my father that way. 
 ( shouting ) 
 [Jake] You okay?

 [Kimberly] They said that it was an accident, but just doesn't feel right. There was some big feud going on. 
 [Mal] With the Pittman brothers? 
 [Kimberly] Dad called me and there was something with his voice, I could tell. He said "don't worry, everything will be all right." So, I got on the first flight home, but I was too late. 
 [Jake] Why don't you tell us about this feud. 
 [Kimberly] Gordie Pittman injured his back on the boat, said it was dad's fault. 
 [Mal] He blamed Pete? 
 [Kimberly] Gordie Pittman, Reg Pittman and there's dad. 
 [Jake] Hmm. Those were happier times, I guess, huh? 
 [Mal] When my wife passed away, years ago, you two were kids. 
 [Kimberly] I remember, same time mom died. 
 [Mal] Pete and I, we leaned on each other pretty heavily. He was a great man. 
 [Lisa] Hi, Kim? 
 [Kimberly] Can I help you? 
 [Lisa] Hi, I'm Lisa, I'm so sorry for your loss. I thought you might like to have this. 
 [Jake] You were at the service earlier. 
 [Lisa] Yeah, I'm a painter. I've been renting the summer house from Pete. He was a real gentleman, great sense of humour. 
 [Mal] That your work? It's great. 
 [Lisa] He paid me with 3 months free rent. It belongs to you now. But I thought it would look great in the dining room. 
 [Kimberly] That's okay. Um, I can do this. Thank you. 
 [Lisa] Of course. I, um. Anyway, he was a, such a nice man. If there's anything at all I can do... 
 [Kimberly] Thank you. I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened to my father. 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] That painter girl seemed pretty at home in the house. 
 [Jake] Yeah. She knew exactly where to find that hammer, eh? 
 You don't think that maybe, you don't think that maybe there might have been something goin' on between her and Pete? 
 [Mal] Never underestimate the appeal of the virile older man. 
 [Christian] Gentlemen. 
 [Mal] How's business? 
 [Christian] Never better. Can I talk to ya for a sec? It's important. 
 [Mal] Go on. I'll see ya upstairs. 
 [Jake] What's all of this? 
 [Terry] I need to sell the bar. 
 [Christian] He needs to sell the bar. This is like, our plan from way back. 
 [Terry] There's no need to enjoy my sufferin' so much. 
 [Christian] Ha-ha. Sorry. But he's gotta sell it fast. So, listen up. I can get my hands of half that down payment. 8% down is 40 grand each. 
 [Jake] Where the hell are you coming up with this kinda money? 
 [Christian] I got investments. 
 [Terry] If I don't sell the place, it'll go to my ex-wife. 
 You gotta help me out here. 
 [Christian] Jake, this is always the dream, right? You and me, working together. Something to fall back on when we're old and stupid. 
 [Jake] I don't have this kinda money, Christian and I'm pretty sure you don't either. 
 [Christian] Jake, I'm tryin' to do something. Tryin' to make somethin' here. Come on. Help me. 
 [Jake] I'll talk to you about it later, all right? 
 ( door buzzing ) 
 ( buzzing stops ) 
 ( door buzzing ) 
 [Jake] Very funny. 
 [Christian] Ha-ha-ha. 
 [Rose] Okay, Gordie Pittman was the only other man on the boat when Pete disappeared. And according t this police report, Gordie says it was a "freak accident, a rogue wave". 
 [Des] Really? A "rogue wave"? 
 [Mal] What about Gordie's brother? 
 [Rose] Reg Pittman wasn't on board. 
 [Jake] But all 3 had equal shares on the boat, right? 
 [Des] Who's that guy right up there on the corner? 
 [Mal] Alex Pittman, Gordie's son. He's an engineer with the city. 
 [Des] He looks like he's murderin' someone right there. 
 He needs to relieve his stress, man. Tell him to try meditation. 
 [Rose] Uh, the events of the day unfolded as follows, Des... 
 [Des] Yeah. Um, 5:00am, crab boat leaves the harbour and proceeds, according m my calculations, to this spot here-ish. Give or take. 
 [Mal] Then what? 
 [Des] Uh, 6:47 am, S.O.S. call goes out. 7:00am, search and rescue commences, but alas, the body was never found. 
 [Jake] Dad, any chance that Pete might of, you know, committed suicide? 
 [Mal] No, not Pete. 
 [Jake] Maybe he was sick or something, you know, had cancer. 
 It's certainly a cleaner way out. 
 [Rose] You know what? I looked into his medical history, he has healthy as a horse...A little high cholesterol, but that's about it. 
 [Mal] Kim seems to think there was foul play. 
 [Rose] You know, the business had an insurance policy. 
 Accidental death, say from a rogue wave. 
 [Mal] Pays a jackpot. 
 [Des] Sounds highly suspicious. 
 [Jake] Des, call the coastguard. 
 See if you can get a copy of that S.O.S. tape. 
 [Des] Roger that, big daddy. 
 [Jake] Dad, you and me, let's go pay a visit to the Pittmans. 
 [Mal] See ya, hun. 
 [Rose] Bye, darling. 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] This bar deal with you and Christian, I think it's a good idea. I got some money set aside. I'll put up your half. 
 [Jake] My half? Never mind about my half. Where the hell is Christian getting his half? 
 [Mal] You should have some faith in your brother. He's making a go of it. He needs our support. 
 [Jake] Whatever. This is Gordie's boat here, I think. 
 [Mal] Gordie? Gordie Pittman? 
 Hi. 
 [Gordie] You two were at the funeral. If you're with those insurance turds, I already told ya... 
 [Jake] No look, we're not with any insurance turds. 
 [Mal] I'm an old friend of Pete's from back in the day. 
 [Jake] Kim Ryan just wants to know more about the circumstances of her father's death. It's quite a bad back for you to have goin' on there, Gord. 
 [Gordie] It's none of your business. 
 [Mal] Can you tell us what happened on the water? We understand you were the only other person there. 
 [Gordie] I went below because the engine was stalled. The fuel filter was clogged. When I came back up to get the part, he was away and gone... rogue wave. 
 [Jake] Really? 
 [Gordie] It happens. 
 [Jake] Maybe we could come aboard, you know, have a look around, see where Pete went over. 
 [Gordie] Sure. Goin' out for a 5hr run. 
 [Mal] By yourself? That's one bad back to be haulin' crab pots in with, Gordie. 
 [Jake] Look, you go find Gordie's brother, Reg. I'll go check out his son, see what he has to say. And mind your own business about this whole bar thing, all right? 
 [Mal] What do you mean, "mind my own business"? It's my son. 
 [Alex] Boys, boys, I said knock it off, I said! My dad's the real victim in all this. He was totally shafted by Pete Ryan. 
 [Jake] Gordie was shafted how? 
 [Alex] He screwed up his back. 
 There was an accident on the boat last year. It was all. 
 Pete's fault and now my dad's going to be in constant pain for the rest of his life. 
 [Jake] Really? 
 [Alex] And then Pete Ryan goes and screws up the insurance claim.Y y dad doesn't get a nickel in compensation. Plus Pete was cookin' the books. 
 Money was missin', dissapearin'. 
 I can prove that. 
 [Jake] You think that Pete was stealin' money from Gordie? 
 [Alex] Yes. Dad lives with me, now. He loves it here. Boys! 
 Look, I'm not tellin' you again, all right! Knock it off. That's your grandfather's room. Keeps it locked 'cause he likes his privacy. Look, Pete died. Dad went below when the engine stalled, it was the fuel filter that was clogged. When he came back up, there he was, gone. It was a rogue wave. 
 [Jake] Those were the words your father used, I mean, his exact words. 
 [Alex] Look, I'm real sorry Pete Ryan died, really, I am. But you know what? It was about time my father retired and if that's what it took then that's what it took. 
 [Mal] So, your brother Gordie told us to come talk to you. 
 [Reg] I haven't set foot on that boat all year. They booted me off, Pete and Gordie. 
 [Mal] Why would they do that, Reg? 
 [Reg] It's been a slow year for crab. So all of a sudden they decided to go with a 2-man boat. 
 It was all Pete's idea. Turned my own brother against me. 
 [Mal] Must have built up a lot of resentment. 
 [Reg] Who'd you say you were? 
 [Mal] Friend of the family. 
 [Reg] Ah, Ryan family. 
 [Mal] That's right. 
 [Reg] Look, I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but Pete Ryan was a crook and a sleveen. 
 He was cookin' the books, rippin' us off. 
 [Mal] Really? 
 [Reg] $50,000. Cash. 
 Ask Gordie, he knows all about it. That's my money too! I'm a partner. Pete had no right. 
 ♪ 
 [Christian] What's that? 
 [Jake] Here's how it's gonna work. You make no decisions without me, you make no purchases without me, you sign no cheques without my signature. 
 You want a partner, I am not the silent type. 
 [Christian] Good. This is good. 
 You're not gonna regret it. 
 [Jake] I hope not. 
 [Christian] See, this is how brothers should be. Workin' together, helpin' each other out... New beginnings. 
 [Jake] New beginnings. Don't screw this up. 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] Gordie was already pissed at Pete for shagging up his back. 
 [Mal] Reg was sayin' Pete was rippin' 
'em off, which I find hard to believe. 
 [Jake] And Gordie goes and gets a policy that pays out double for accidental death. 
 [Mal] One hell of a motive. 
 [Jake] One little push, you know, a lot of his problems are solved. Permission to come aboard, skipper? Gordie! 
 [Mal] Gordie. 
 [Jake] So ah, why don't I jump aboard and have a look, huh? 
 Dad! Dad. You okay? 
 [Mal] Yeah, I'm fine. 
 ( car engine starting ) 
 ( tires screeching ) 
 [Jake] You all right? 
 [Mal] I'm fine. But someone wants us to stop diggin' around. 
 [Kimberly] Was it Gordie? 
 [Jake] It's hard to say. 
 [Kimberly] The Pittman brothers conspired to kill my dad, I knew it. 
 [Jake] We're not exactly there, just yet, okay, Kim. 
 [Mal] We understand your father kept the books for the business. 
 [Mal] Yeah, they're in one of these piles, somewhere. Why? 
 [Jake] The Pittman's are accusing your father of stealing from them. Maybe up to $50,000. 
 [Mal] We gotta check the books, Kim. Could speak to motive. 
 [Kimberly] That's ridiculous! My dad would never... he was painfully honest! Mal, you know that. 
 [Mal] To a fault at times, I know. But we have to check all the angles. 
 [Kimberly] Yeah, uh, I've... I've been trying to get his affairs in order. I dunno, there are papers shoved everywhere, all over this house and his watch is missing, one that I gave him. There's a picture that I can't find, but I know it was here. 
 [Mal] The one I saw here earlier? 
 [Kimberly] In the silver frame, yeah. 
 [Jake] Has he played these? 
 [Kimberly] I didn't even know that was there. 
 [Answering machine] 
Thursday, 10:43am. 
 [Reg] Buddy, it's Reg... again. 
 Don't make me do this. I will get my revenge. Me and Gord, we'll get you back for everything you've done...I want my money. 
 [Jake] Reg Pittman. 
 [Mal] Gordie's brother. 
 [Kimberly] They're all the Sam those Pittmans. They're crazy. 
 I'm telling you, they did it. 
 [Jake] What was the weather like that day? Des? 
 [Des] Uh, there was a heavy fog that morning. Seas were calm and no reports of a rogue wave. 
 [Mal] What about Gordie's S.O.S. 
 Call? 
 ♪ Did you ever know that you're my hero?♪ 
 [Des] Sorry, that's from, uh, a project... Separate from this. 
 Don't know how it got there. 
 [Jake] S.O.S. Call, here we go. 
 [Gordie] Canada Coast Guard this is vessel Patrick Joseph, we are in distress. We have a man overboard. We have a man overboard. 
 [Jake] Whoa, play that back again. 
 [Gordie] Canada coast guard, this is vessel Patrick... [Jake] That. 
 [Des] Seagulls? I can isolate the frequency. 
 [Mal] No, no. The engine. Play it again. 
 [Gordie] We are in distress. We have a man overboard. 
 [Mal] That. 
 [Jake] Exactly. Gordie said the engine stalled. It was never broken. 
 [Mal] He goes below, engine's broke, he comes back up, rogue wave... Pete's overboard. 
 [Jake] Then he decides to go back down, fix the engine, come back up, then call for help. 
 [Des] That'll be stupid. 
 [Jake] Gordie's lying. That engine never stalled. 
 [Rose] I know you're not gonna like this, but I'm going through. 
 Pete's business accounts and there's over 20 thousand dollars in cash missing and I'm only about half-way through. 
 [Mal] What? Pete was stealing money? You sure? 
 [Rose] Yeah. I'm sorry, hun. 
 [Mal] Doesn't make any sense. 
 [Jake] What if before Pete ever got on that boat, he was already dead? 
 [Mal] Interesting. 
 [Jake] 2 brothers, they went out together. 
 [Rose] So, Gordie and Reg get revenge and split the insurance money. 
 [Mal] I'm gettin' a bad feelin'. 
 Maybe we should call the cops in on this. 
 [Jake] Oh normally I would disagree with you on that point, but, uh, for Kim's sake, I think it's a good idea. Des, how'd you like a little assignment? 
 [Des] Yeah, why? 
 [Jake] I need you to keep an eye on Reg Pittman. Do you understand? 
 [Des] Yeah, yeah. For sure. 
 ♪ Did you ever know that you're my hero ♪ 
 [Des] It's... a separate project. 
 [Alex] Can't just keep him here. 
 He has his rights. 
 [Hood] Nobody's talkin' about keeping anyone here. We're just talking. 
 [Leslie] It's just a couple of questions. No big deal, right. 
 Mr. Pittman? In a statement to Jake and Malachy Doyle, you said the boat stalled, you went down below and when you came up, Pete Ryan had disappeared. 
 [Gordie] Rogue wave. 
 [Alex] Dad. 
 [Hood] There's no report from the coastguard of a rogue wave. 
 [Gordie] It happens. 
 [Leslie] You also said the boat needed repairs and you replaced a part of the engine. Is this true? 
 [Alex] It was the fuel filter. 
 It was totally clogged. 
 [Gordie] Engine stalled right out just before the rogue wave hit. It happens. 
 [Leslie] We're gonna take a look at that engine, Gordie. And for your sake, I hope there's a new fuel filter. 
 [Mal] He's a terrible liar. 
 [Jake] The only reason why he would have went below was if there was a body down there that he had to dump. 
 [Leslie] Maybe you saw Pete slip over the side. 
 [Gordie] No! I already told ya, I didn't see anything! 
 [Hood] Maybe you pushed him over the side for the insurance money? 
 [Alex] Look, leave him alone. 
 Alright, he's a senior citizen. 
 You'll be talkin' to our lawyers. 
 [Leslie] You're free to go, Mr. Pittman. But you'll be seein' us, we're gonna have a look at that boat. 
 [Alex] Come on, dad. 
 [Mal] Looks to me like we touched a nerve. 
 [Leslie] Maybe, but there's nothin' to go on, yet. We'll keep you posted when we have a look at the boat. 
 [Hood] Jake, good to see ya. You look good. 
 [Jake] You look like a freak. 
 [Leslie] Jake, don't be a jerk. Come on, Hood. Don't mind him. 
 [Jake] Hey there, awesome. 
 [Allison] Hey, uh, listen. I can't make it tonight. Uh, it's a work thing. Can't be helped. 
 [Jake] All right, no, that's no problem. 
 [Allison] How about tomorrow? Noon? 
 [Jake] Sounds great. Do you want me to wear something revealing? 
 [Allison] No, we're gonna be working... Deposition, remember? 
 [Jake] I look forward to it. 
 [Allison] Okay, I gotta run. See ya later. 
 [Jake] Right, bye. 
 
 
 
 [Mal] He wasn't able to talk. Pint? 
 [Jake] He pay for this? 
 [Christian] No. 
 [Jake] How many times do I gotta tell ya, no free pints! To anyone! 
 [Mal] You do a father's heart proud. 
 [Christian] It's a couple pints, relax, Jake. 
 [Jake] A couple pints? Look, it all adds up. Christian. All right, and if you're givin' free pints to this one, .. 
 ( cellphone ringing ) 
 [Jake] He'll drink us to the ground, trust me. What? 
 [Des] They're fighting. 
 [Jake] Who? Who's fighting? 
 [Des] Reg and Gordie! They're having a huge scrap. 
 [Gordie] You're young, you can do whatever you want! Me, I got no other options! 
 [Reg] I'm gonna find that money! 
 Mark my words, Gordie. Look, I'm goin' right now, I have to get there before the cops... [Gordie] 
Stay away from my boat. 
 [Des] Reg is leavin', I think he's headed for the boat. 
 [Jake] Okay, listen to me. You go home and we'll take care of it, all right? 
 [Des] Okay, okay. 
 [Jake] You wanna go to work, or what? 
 [Mal] See ya later. 
 [Jake] Man, how long we gotta stay out here? 
 [Mal] As long as it takes. 
 [Jake] There he is. So what do you think he's after? You think he's lookin' for the money? 
 [Mal] Or coverin' up his tracks. 
 So, if Gordie and Reg did this together... 
 [Jake] They take the body, they put it in the boat, bring it out, dump it in the sea. 
 [Mal] Now he's cleanin' up the evidence of the murder. 
 [Jake] Let's go in and have a look. Quietly! All right, stay here, keep an eye. 
 [Mal] Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] What? 
 [Jake] Reg! Reg! Get off the boat! Get off the boat! Run, dad, run! Go! 
 [Reg] Told you, I was part co-owner... 
 [Mal] Couple of propane tanks fused together. A bomb like that could have been planted by anyone with a little know-how. 
 [Jake] Well, I'm pretty sure it's not Reg. Unless, you know, he's really, really bad at trying to commit suicide. He claims he was lookin' for the money that Pete stole from him. 
 [Mal] So it was Gordie, destroying evidence... or Gordie's son, Alex. 
 [Jake] So maybe it was Gordie and his son, and Reg here is in the clear. 
 [Reg] Look, I told you, I didn't do it! All right, all right, just take it easy. 
 [Hood] That's enough of that. 
 [Jake] By the way, he's gotta be pissed about the whole boat blowin' up. He's still a business partner. 
 [Mal] We just gotta be lookin' twice as hard for the missing 50 grand. 
 [Jake] So maybe we gotta find it first. Why don't you send Des over to Pete's place and if he stole the money, and I'm only saying if, he's gotta have it stashed somewhere, right? Come on, dad. Let's just do it to prove that Pete didn't steal the money. I almost died... heavy stuff. Would that make you sad? 
 [Leslie] I should be so lucky. 
 Look, I know you like to do the things your own way, but could ya not get yourself killed doin' it? 
 [Jake] Is that your way of tryin' to tell me that you care? 
 [Leslie] You can come to your own conclusions, can't ya? 
 [Jake] How we makin' out? 
 [Christian] Real good. Nothin' we can't handle. I'm doing it all with due diligence, Jake. 
 [Jake] I promise I'll try and enjoy this whole thing, all right? I'll relax. 
 [Christian] This, is our dream. 
 Gotta trust me, brother. 
 [Jake] I do trust you. 
 [Ron] Mornin' Jake. 
 [Jake] Big fat Ronnie, what are you doin' here? 
 [Christian] It's nothin', I got this. It's okay. 
 [Ronnie] Oh, you don't know? You don't! We're partners! Yeah, he didn't tell ya. 
 [Christian] Ronnie. 
 [Jake] How much? 
 [Ronnie] Oh, enough, believe me. 
 [Christian] Jake, it's honest... It's not what you think. 
 [Jake] I thought you said you had investments? 
 [Christian] Well, they were harder to cash in then I thought, all right? I need a week or 2. It's gonna be fine, don't worry about this. 
 [Ronnie] I'm sensing this is a bad time. Maybe we could catch up later? 
 [Jake] Get out. 
 [Ronnie] Yeah. 
 [Jake] I can't believe that I bought into all your crap. 
 [Christian] Jake... 
 [Jake] You're a pathetic idiot. 
 No, no. Sorry. You're not an idiot... I am. We're sellin' the bar and you're gonna pay Ronnie back. 
 [Kimberly] You should be searching Gordie's house, not this one. If anyone was stealing money it was one of the. 
 Pittmans, not my dad. 
 [Des] Well, I'm sure I won't find a thing. 
 [Kimberly] Okay, start in the basement. And if you could keep your eye out for a sterling silver picture frame with little flowers around the edge with pictures of my parents; I've been looking for it everywhere. 
 [Des] Will do. 
 [Kimberly] And, my dad's watch with an engraving... "Love from Kim". I gave it to him last Christmas. 
 [Des] Okay. 
 [Kimberly] Other things are missing too, my dad's personal stuff. So y you find anything down there, please... ( sobbing ) 
 [Kimberly] Sorry. 
 [Des] Uh... it's okay. It's okay. 
 [Kimberly] I just, I... I really miss him. You know? And I should have tried harder and seen him more. 
 [Des] Yeah. 
 [Kimberly] I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye and now I'm just... I'm really sad and I wish that I had the chance to see him again. But it's too late. 
 [Des] No! It's not too late... Well I mean, yeah, yeah, I guess it is... definitely too late, but... Yeah. 
 [Kimberly] Right, well... um... If you find anything down there, you just let me know. Okay? 
 [Des] Okay. 
 [Jake] Gordie!

 [Jake] Where is he? 
 [Alex] He's exhausted. The police just left, they've been here for over an hour, grillin' us, again. It was very upsetting. 
 [Mal] We just need a minute, about your father's boat blowin' up. 
 [Alex] Well I don't know anything about that and frankly the two of you have got a lot of nerve comin' back here. 
 [Mal] Look, we're sorry. Can we just... Calm down, go over this again. 
 [Jake] Yeah, look, uh... we are really sorry, okay? I'm actually gonna step out, I've gotta make a call. I'll catch up with you guys.

 [Jake] I... look, I promise I'll get it right on the day, all right? The other buddy went over to the other buddy and he cracked him in the head with the tire iron. Simple. 
 [Allison] I have an idea. For every answer that you get right, I'll take off a piece of clothing. But for every one that you get wrong...

 [Jake] Do you do this with all of your witnesses? 
 [Allison] Wrong. 
 [Jake] No, no, now, now, now don't go puttin' stuff back on.

 [Des] It's a... it's a policy, it's a life insurance policy. 
 [Lisa] Stop it! You've got this all wrong! 
 [Des] Pete made Lisa the beneficiary. 
 [Jake] Why? 
 [Des] She's about to get 2 million dollars. 
 [Lisa] I was shocked, I had no idea that I was... That he had done this. 
 [Jake] What exactly was your relationship with Pete, exactly? 
 [Lisa] Well, that's just it. I mean, we were friends, I think. 
 He liked my work, I painted his portrait. You know, we talked. 
 [Jake] No offense, but you're lying. 
 [Mal] This policy is only a couple months old. Why would he make you the beneficiary instead of his own daughter? 
 [Lisa] Trust me, I'm as surprised as anyone. 
 [Jake] Ahh! Lying again. Are you sure there wasn't a little more to your "friendship"? 
 [Lisa] Don't be crude. This whole thing is... crazy. 
 [Jake] You know, for a friend, you sure do have a lot of photos of Pete layin' around. 
 [Lisa] I work from photos. 
 That's how I start. It's my process. It's perfectly normal. 
 [Mal] Is that, uh... 
 [Lisa] Me, yes. I just finished a self-portrait. Unless you're in the market for some artwork, gentlemen, I'd day that's good day. 
 [Jake] Yeah. 
 [Mal] Thank you. 
 [Kimberly] This all makes sense to me now. I've been noticing things going missing the past couple of days. My dad's best watch, a silver picture frame... 
 [Jake] So you think Lisa's stealin' them? 
 [Kimberly] I think that she's a thief and a con artist who weaseled my dad into buying that policy and then had him killed.

 Lisa's credit card bill. 
 [Jake] Well, there's purchase on here from last week. 
$5,900 to an online travel agency.

 Must be flying first class.

 [Jake] Uh, yeah. I'm pretty sure that Lisa and Gordie, were a bit of an item... And I think they killed Pete Ryan. 
 [Mal] So she dupes Pete into buying the insurance policy. 
 [Jake] And then she convinces Gordie to dump him over the side of the boat. What'd you find out about those airline tickets? 
 [Mal] Uh, she's headed to Costa Rica. 
 [Rose] Yeah, and here's a weird thing. It's 2 tickets, not 1, departing from Iceland.

 [Pete] Nah, we're just collecting what's owed to us, darling. 
 [Gordie] They didn't pay a nickel, not a nickel on my back. 
 [Pete] Yeah, so we're collectin', one way or another. 
 [Jake] So you fake Pete's death, you collect the 2 million bucks and then you retire to Costa Rica. That is not a bad plan. 
 [Gordie] I'm just tired. 
 [Pete] Yeah, and his back is not fit. I mean, this guy deserves to have a few beers on a beach. 
 [Gordie] It's better than sitting in me son's house, waiting to die. We kept the 50 thousand to get us started. 
 [Pete] And most of it we spent on rentin' this friggin' boat, since this one blew up ours. 
 [Gordie] It was a beautiful moment, I have to tell ya. 
 [Pete] Yeah, the rest of it we gave to a skipper of a troller offshore. They were gonna take us the rest of the way to Iceland.

 [Gordie] So, what are you gonna do, cop?
