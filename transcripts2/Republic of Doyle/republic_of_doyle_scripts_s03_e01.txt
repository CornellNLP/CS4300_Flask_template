 Previously on Republic of Doyle... 
 [Tinny] I'm going to London. I get to go for a year. 
 [Des] - Like a whole year? 
 [Des] - No one will be there. 
 [Leslie] I'm in the hospital. I've been shot. 
 [Leslie] You should see the look on your face. 
 [Jake] I love you. 
 [Rose] You get on a plane, and you fly away, and the world doesn't end while you're gone. 
 [Rose] 300 thousand. 
 [Rose] Picture yourself on a beach somewhere. 
 [Mal] Then shouldn't you be wearing a bikini? 
 [Mal] It's been a good run, Jake. You need to know when to end your story. 
 [Jake] You sure about this, skipper? 
 [Tarrent] Mr. Doyle, I'm inspector Tarrent. 
 [Jake] What do you want? Is this a joke? 
 [Tarrent] We could use you. Your city could use you. 
 [Tarrent] My recommendation is going to be that you are suspended with pay. 
 [Tarrent] We just want to make sure that you're not a dirty cop. 
 [Leslie] Right. 
 [Leslie] He used my access card. 
 They fired me. 
 ♪ 
 [Tarrent] When I transferred here to St. John's, crime was on the rise dramatically, and now with my help, the royal newfoundland constabulary is pushing crime over your pine-clad hills. 
 (Press chatter) 
 [Reporter] Inspector Tarrent, an undercover federal officer, Anita Squires, was killed here in St. John's. 
 [Tarrent] I'm not at liberty to discuss any potentially on-going cases with the local RNC or any other forces. 
 (Press chatter) 
 [Reporter] Word is another officer, Jake Doyle, is terrorizing the population. 
 [Jake] Stop! RNC, you friggin bellhead! 
 [Tarrent] Jake Doyle and all of my officers adhere to strict protocol, discipline and procedure. 
 Police are not above the law. We do everything by the book. 
 (Wham!) [Jake] Oh! 
 [Tarrent] I stand behind all my officers and their conduct-- 
 [Jake] I just want to talk to you! 
 [Tarrent] I stake my reputation on it. 
 [Hood] (Panting) 
 [Jake] Stop! 
 ♪ 
 (Scuffling) 
 [Jake] Why the hell did you make me chase you like that? 
 [Jimmy] Why are you running after me? See, I can ask stupid questions too. 
 [Jake] Why are you taking pictures all over the cop station, huh? 
 [Jimmy] Art! I'm an art major. 
 Photography and-- 
 [Jake] Yeah, you're an art major my arse. You look like a perv to me, so why don't you tell me what you're really up to before I start giving you a few taps in the head, huh? 
 [Jimmy] You're a cop, so from my vantage point, you can't do nothing to me. 
 [Jake] Is that right? How's the vantage point now? 
 [Jimmy] You got, you got me all wrong! 
 [Jake] What do you weigh? Like 160, 165? 
 [Jimmy] 155! Let me down! I'm gonna puke! 
 [Jake] Oh man, my old arms are getting pretty tired here, so the sooner you tell me what you're up to-- 
 [Jimmy] No, don't drop me. I'm afraid of heights! 
 [Jake] Are you sure you're 155, because you feel a lot heavier than that to me. 
 [Jimmy] Okay, I'm working on something, but I can't tell you what it is. 
 [Jake] - You can't tell me? 
 [Jimmy] - Put me down. 
 [Hood] Let him down. Now! 
 [Jake] Just relax, okay Telly Savalas-- 
 (Crash!) 
 [Jimmy] (Groaning) 
 [Jake] I didn't do it on purpose. 
 [Donny] Did Jimmy just-- 
 [Wolf] Yeah. Fell right off the top of her. 
 (Click) 
 [Boyd] So that's Jake Doyle. 
 He'd better not get in our way. 
 [Hood] You're writing this up. 
 [Boyd] Why don't you go find out if Jimmy's still alive.

 [Jimmy] You dropped me from a building! 
 [Jake] You slipped. Now I've been watching you. 
 Why are you staking out the police station? 
 [Jimmy] You're paranoid. Yeah, I'll bet you suffer from delusional tendencies. I'm just a tourist. 
 [Jake] A tourist? Well this is some very interesting gear for a tourist. Up on the roof, that you slipped from, you mentioned something about working on something. 
 [Jimmy] - Hmm. 
 [Jake] - Care to elaborate? 
 [Jimmy] Buddy, I was hanging upside down off of a building. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. But this little stunt you pulled? 
 It's gonna land me on the street and you in front of a judge. Ha! 
 [Tarrent] Hood, cut this guy loose. Doyle. 
 [Hood] - You're free to go. 
 [Jimmy] - Yeah. 
 [Jimmy] Hey. This local cop, Doyle? I hope he doesn't blow the whole plan. 
 ♪ 
 [Rose] (Sigh) 
 [Mal] Home, sweet home. 
 (Bottles rattling) 
 [Rose] How much rum do you have in that thing, anyway? 
 [Mal] Tons. Cheap as dirt down there. 
 [Rose] (Laughs) Nice retirement, huh? 
 [Mal] Retirement indeed. 
 [Rose] So, you miss seeing me in a bikini already? 
 [Mal] Take your clothes off and remind me what it looks like. 
 [Rose] Nothing stopping us with tinny gone, and Christian moved out of the house. 
 [Mal] Good point. 
 [Rose] You miss your boys. I know we've talked to Christian already, but I can tell you miss Jake. Why don't you go see him? 
 [Mal] Wonder if he's been fired from being a cop yet. 
 [Rose] 50 bucks says he's still on the force. 
 [Mal] You're on. (Laughter) 
 [Rose] Tell him to come by later for supper. 
 [Mal] Hey, I didn't say anything about feeding him. 
 And if he comes over, hide the rum. 
 [Rose] Okay. 
 [Tarrent] You dropped a man from a roof. 
 [Jake] It was an accident. 
 [Tarrent] In six months you've managed to disobey every order I've given you. 
 [Jake] That's not true, exactly. Some of them I just ignored. 
 [Tarrent] You ignore all protocol. You got the RNC in the newspaper 37 times. 
 [Jake] Any press is, like, good press, so-- 
 [Tarrent] You drove a SWAT van into the harbor, you've wracked up 200 hours in overtime, you scared a police dog into retirement. 
 [Jake] That dog was just not cut out for the force. 
 [Tarrent] I'm beginning to wonder if you are. 
 You know, I was doing just fine before you made me join this silly little club. 
 Perhaps it's better for everyone involved if you and I just go our separate ways. 
 [Tarrent] And then what? Go back to being a slimy private investigator? 
 [Jake] Something like that, yeah. 
 [Jake] - I quit. 
 [Tarrent] - Wait. 
 [Jake] Look, if you want my gun, I never checked one out, so-- 
 [Tarrent] Just wait. Look at this. 
 [Jake] Is this Albert Chandler? 
 Isn't he, like, an organized crime pitbull or something? 
 [Tarrent] Well, he's about to offer testimony against his mob friends, not just here but nation-wide. 
 Chandler has evidence that a top mob operative killed Anita Squires. 
 He's not talking until his testimony on Monday. 
 [Jake] What does this have to do with me? 
 [Tarrent] Jake, this is a big fish. This is-- 
 [Cop] - Excuse me. 
 [Tarrent] - ...Part of the reason why I came here to work with the RNC. 
 I need you to keep him safe until Monday. 
 [Jake] Me? Why? 
 [Tarrent] You might be an arsehole and a disgrace to the badge, but I know that you would never turn to the dark side, and right about now you might be the only guy that I can trust. 
 Please. 
 [Jake] You want me to babysit this guy? 
 [Tarrent] He's about to take down a major organized crime syndicate. There are a lot of dangerous people who want to kill him. I need you to keep him alive. 
 [Jake] Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll do this for you. 
 I will. I'll keep Chandler safe. 
 But you've gotta get Leslie Bennett her job back. 
 [Tarrent] She's lucky she ended up where she did. 
 You of all people know that. 
 [Jake] Bennett gets her job back or you've got no deal. 
 [Tarrent] You keep Chandler safe until Monday, and I'll see what I can do about Leslie Bennett. 
 [Tarrent] Where we're holding him. 
 Relieve the officer on the scene, and I do not need to tell you to keep this job to yourself. 
 ♪ 
 [Donny] What's he doing here? 
 [Wolf] Oh, Jake Doyle. 
 [Wolf] He's here at the targets location. Are you fellas seeing this? 
 [Donny] - We gotta stop him. 
 [Jimmy] - Let me stop him. I'll stop him. 
 [Wolf] Arse is out of her, b'ys. 
 The shagger might have spotted me. 
 [Boyd] It's alright. I'll check this guy out. Everybody stay in position. 
 [Boyd] Head's up! Oh ho ho ho. 
 [Boyd] Sorry about that. 
 [Jake] "Head's up", says the drunk after he knocks me down. 
 [Boyd] Not drunk yet. That's what the beer's for. 
 D'you needs? 
 [Boyd] Something wrong? 
 [Jake] Other than the fact that you just clothes-lined me? No b'y, I'm the best kind. 
 [Boyd] Police business? 
 [Jake] Now how did you know I was a cop? 
 [Boyd] Well, unless you work for a high-security cab company, I kinda figured, you know? 
 [Jake] Right. 
 [Boyd] Working on something big, officer? 
 [Jake] Look pally, why don't you just muck along now, alright? 
 [Boyd] Alright. Okay. 
 [Boyd] Hey, keep your heads-up in the future. 
 ♪ 
 [Boyd] He's not here for us; He's not carrying a gun. 
 Alright? Get ready to move. 
 (Knocking) 
 [Edward] Jake Doyle? What the hell are you doing here? 
 [Jake] Eddie knight. Wow, a long way from your post on belle island. 
 Listen, Eddie, you should know there is something weird going on outside. 
 [Edward] Jake, you're not supposed to be here. 
 [Jake] Yes, I am. Eddie, listen to me. 
 There's a creepy fella out in the parking lot, okay? 
 And my gut is telling me something is wrong. 
 [Chandler] Who is this guy? What is he talking about? 
 [Jake] You must be Chandler. 
 [Edward] This is a federal case, Jake. 
 [Jake] What's with the charm bracelet? 
 [Edward] None of your business. 
 [Chandler] What's in here would put a lot of guys away for a long time. 
 If you want it you're gonna have to take my arm too. 
 [Edward] Ignore him. 
 [Jake] Could you find a place with more windows, Eddie? 
 Who booked this room? 
 [Edward] Jake, knock it off! 
 [Jake] There's something about to go down outside. 
 I don't know what, but you should go out and check, don't you think? 
 [Jake] Trust me. 
 [Edward] Alright, but don't do anything while I am gone. 
 Please. 
 [Edward] I'll check outside, and when I come back I will call my boss and see what you're doing here. 
 [Jake] Hey, get away from the window, idiot. 
 [Chandler] You gonna tell me what's going on here? 
 [Jake] You're Chandler huh? So tell me, what's it take for a big crime guy like you to turn on all of his friends. 
 [Chandler] First of all, I don't have any friends in this business. 
 Second of all, at least I was smart enough to know when to get out. 
 (Gun shot) 
(Glass shattering) (Thud) 
 [Edward] - What the hell'd you do? 
 [Jake] - I didn't do anything. 
 [Edward] Oh!

 [Jake] Wolf. 
 [Wolf] Nice to see you. 
 [Wolf] Not much of a reunion, hey b'y? 
 [Jake] Just-- 
 (Crash!) 
 (Sirens) 
 [Donny] He's got the briefcase. 
 [Wolf] B'ys, we might wanna take this somewhere else. 
 [Jimmy] You're telling the boss we messed this up. Not me. 
 [Rose] So where's my 50 bucks? Jake is still a cop, isn't he? 
 [Mal] Yeah. I was sure he'd be fired. 
 [Rose] You're dying to know what case he's on, what he's up to. 
 Don't lie. 
 [Mal] Go away with you. My life doesn't revolve around that walking disaster. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Rose] Give me that. We've been home from our first retirement vacation for, what, 2 minutes, and you're already with the phone? 
 [Mal] No. 
 [Mal] I'm retired. With you. 
 I promise.

 Repeat, approach with extreme caution and call for immediate back-up if you locate the whereabouts of Jake Doyle. 
 [Leslie] Look at my hand. What does this mean, sir? 
 What does common sense tell you this action is connected to? 
 [Leslie] It means stop. You got it? Stop. 
 [Leslie] Come on. I hear you all barking your horns. 
 You'll have to wait now until I'm good and ready. 
 [Leslie] Casual Friday? Must be nice. 
 [Leslie] Keep walking, Jake. Oh, I'm sorry. Or should I call you "sir"? 
 Leslie, I've been calling and calling you, but you won't answer your phone. 
 [Leslie] And why do you think that is? Because you got me fired, maybe? 
 Or because they took me back as a friggin meter maid? 
 [Jake] I need you to take this briefcase. Leslie, I need your help. 
 [Leslie] Help? You want my help? 
 You get me fired, and then I gotta take this friggin job and you want my help? 
 [Leslie] Keep it moving! 
 [Jake] When you put it like that, it does sound kind of bad, I know, but-- 
 [Leslie] Look, Jake, although technically you are my superior officer, if you don't get out of my face, I swear to God I'm gonna kick the sh1t out of you in front of all these people. 
 [Jake] Leslie, I'm sorry. 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Leslie] Stay away from me Jake. 
 I mean it. I don't want to see you any more. You owe me that at least. 
 (Horn honking) 
 [Leslie] Come on. 
 [Jake] I can't believe it's come to this. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Des] Oh, sorry. 
 [Des] Look, Jake, I can't talk right now. 
 [Jake] Okay Des, turn off your spaz for a second and listen. 
 [Des] See that's what my psychology prof-- did I tell you I'm at mun right now, university? Well, I am, and she says I need to distance myself from people like you, actually just you. You know? 
 It throws off my yin and my Yang? 
 [Des] Ouch. Hey. 
 [Jake]- It's an emergency. 
 [Des] - An emergency. Is it tinny? 
 I knew London was a bad idea. 
 Oh my God, the English have her, don't they? Don't they? 
 [Jake] Oh Des, no. Just shut up. 
 [Des] No, I won't. I won't shut up. Because I've got my own thing going here now. I'm not under your shadow any more. 
 Alright? Not under anyone's shadow. 
 [Jake] It's "in your shadow". Des, please. Take this to Malachy, okay? And tell him I'll make contact with him later. 
 Don't open it, don't lose it, don't go to the cops. 
 And whatever you do Des... 
 Don't screw this up. 
 [Police radio] Attention all units. Be on the look out for sergeant Jake Doyle. 
 He's considered armed and extremely dangerous. Approach with caution. 
 [Jimmy] Well, we just searched your car. No sign of what we're looking for. 
 [Jake] Oh yeah? What's that Jimmy? True happiness? Someone to love you? 
 [Wolf] Jokes ended when you smashed the tv on me head, brother. 
 [Donny] Go. 
 [Jake] So, what? Not going to offer me a beer this time or--? 
 [Boyd] I knew you were going to be a pain in the arse from the moment I saw you. Get in the van. 
 [Jake] As a rule of thumb, I don't jump into vans with strange men, particularly the homicidal, murdering type. 
 [Boyd] I can help you with that. 
 [Boyd] Donny? 
 (Tired screeching) 
 ♪Yeeeah♪ 
 [Mal] See, Jake would never appreciate this. 
 [Rose] No. No, he'd probably put mix in it for God's sake. 
 [Mal] Where's that bikini now? 
 [Reporter] Breaking news. Police say one of their own officers is the top suspect in a murder investigation. 
 RNC officer Jake Doyle is wanted for the murder-- 
 [Rose] Mal. Mal, look at the TV. 
 Look! 
 [Reporter] ... With dark brown hair and blue eyes. 
 [Mal] Jake, what have you done? 
 [Des] Mal, rose! They got Jake. 
 [Rose] What? 
 [Jimmy] I'm just saying, drop a cat from anywhere between the fifth and the ninth floor of a building, and chances are it will die. 
 [Donny] What part of you thought that I would ever be interested in this conversation? 
 [Jimmy] But drop the same cat at anywhere from floors 10 to, like, 34 and the chances of it surviving actually increase. 
 [Donny] I don't care. 
 [Jimmy] Doesn't that make you wonder? What's up with floors five to nine? 
 [Jake] How the leg treating you? 
 [Jimmy] See, that's the past Jake. This poker here, that's about the future. 
 [Donny] Jimmy, you have a poker and a blow torch. 
 [Jimmy] Yeah, this way he'll be more scared. 
 [Donny] Sometimes you're really such a boob. It's no good if you let him know you want him to be scared. You gotta make him scared. 
 [Jimmy] - I'm not a boob. 
 [Jake] - You are a boob. 
 [Donny] The torch is an option, but maybe we should ask the guy if he knows something. 
 [Jake] He's got a very good point there, boob. 
 You haven't asked me, like, one question yet. I mean not one. 
 [Jimmy] Shut up. 
 (Clang) 
 [Boyd] Gentlemen, if we'd executed our plan properly, Mr. Doyle wouldn't have to be here. 
 [Jake] Yeah, it's hard to find good help, hey b'y? 
 [Boyd] But he is, and we're going to have to do this another way. 
 You're going to tell us where Chandler's briefcase is, and if you don't you're gonna have to have a long conversation with the boys. 
 [Donny] - You won't like our tone. 
 [Jimmy] - Or mine. Or his. 
 [Jake] Okay, first of all, I don't know about any briefcase, okay? 
 But if you let me go, I mean I'll dart over to the avalon mall and I'll pick you up a brand new briefcase in whatever color you want. 
 [Wolf] Boss? A second? 
 [Boyd] Alright. Keep Mr. Doyle here company. 
 Don't burn off any of his body parts just yet, Jimmy. 
 [Jake] So, Ladios, which one of you wants to take me to the bathroom? 
 [Jimmy] What's your problem with me all of a sudden? 
 [Donny] All of a sudden? Jimmy, you're always talking, talking yammer. 
 [Jake] So, what, I just go right here in these cuffs? 
 [Donny] You got no filter, no self awareness. It's sad. 
 [Jimmy] That's not true. I am aware. 
 [Jake] What about number two? Do I just go and do a number two here too? 
 [Jimmy] Hey if you do number two here me and that poker will make sure you never do number two ever. 
 [Jake] Well I'm just saying then we have a serious problem is all. 
 [Donny] Just take him to the bathroom. 
 [Jimmy] No. You take him to the bathroom. And I'm going in there before you. 
 [Donny] If you try anything, I'm gonna cut you a new liver. You got that? 
 [Jake] That wouldn't go astray, to be honest with you. 
 (Wham) 
 (Wham) 
 [Jake] Alright buddy, listen to me. You're gonna kill me, okay, so just hold on and I'll, you know, I'll take care of you. 
 [Jake] Jimmy! Come on, quick! Donny's choking! 
 [Jimmy] What? Ow! Son of a buggar! Ow, oh. 
 [Jake] Hang on, Donny. We're gonna count to three, okay, and then you're gonna exhale. Ready? 
 One, two, three! 
 [Jimmy] This will never heal Doyle! 
 [Jake] There you go. 
 [Des] Oh my God. The place has been ransacked. 
 [Rose] No, honey, this is just how Jake lives. 
 [Mal] What exactly did Jake say to you? 
 [Des] He said to trust no one. 
 I don't think he was talking about you, although you are the last person I'd suspect. 
 [Rose] Oh Des, come on now. 
 [Des] He also said not to open it. 
 [Mal] Not to open it? Whatever's in that case got a man killed over it, and Jake could be next. 
 
 
 
 (Sirens) 
 [Rose] Maybe we should take it to the police. 
 [Des] No, no, no. Jake said stay away from the cops. 
 [Rose] - What the hell is in it? 
 [Mal] - I don't know. 
 [Des] Oh, I almost forgot. I took a photo of one of the guys who grabbed Jake. He looked really familiar. 
 [Rose] Let's see. 
 [Rose] That's that Wolf guy. He spent time with Jake in prison. 
 I also talked to a friend at the station who said the cops were holding Albert Chandler in that motel room. The feds. 
 [Mal] Chandler is a soldier for a national criminal organization. 
 [Rose] Yeah, and he was also set to testify against the mob on Monday, with damning evidence, including who killed Anita Squires. 
 [Mal] Now Chandler is dead. 
 [Des] The only loose thread is that briefcase. And it probably has some of Chandler's evidence against the mob. 
 [Mal] Reason for the mob to want it back. Rose, check out the crime scene and see if there's anything there. Anything we can go on. 
 [Rose] - I'm on it. 
 [Mal] - And be careful. 
 [Rose] I will, babe. 
 [Des] Oh. 
 [Donny] You almost killed me back there. 
 [Jake] Yeah, well, look at the bright side. If you had died, you'd never have to listen to Jimmy yammer again. 
 [Donny] That's a good point. 
 [Donny] Where'd you stash the case? 
 [Jake] Okay, first of all, I didn't stash the case anywhere. 
 Second of all, you're in no position to be asking any questions there pally. 
 [Jake] However, I have a feeling that if you got out of those cuffs, the power dynamic would change dramatically. 
 (Sirens) 
 [Jake] Okay you stay cool. 
 [Jake] Crap. 
 (Commotion) 
 [Hood] Everybody stay perfectly still, and nobody move. 
 [Mal] The door wasn't locked. Just saying.

 [Jake] Oh man. 
 [Jake] The cops got the case. 
 Alright, it's time you and me had a little chat. 
 [Jake] What were you guys doing at the motel? Why did you kill Chandler? 
 [Donny] It's a really interesting story, and I'll tell you sometime, but, um, right now I would prefer if we could talk about your musical preferences. 
 [Donny] Myself, I prefer classical. 
 [Rose] We both know Jake didn't kill anybody. 
 [Leslie] This is a crime scene. What are you doing here? 
 [Rose] I could ask you the same question. I'm here to help Jake, just like you. 
 [Leslie] Look, I won't put my neck on the line for Jake Doyle again, and I think you should leave before I arrest you. 
 [Rose] I'm not leaving here until I find evidence that could clear Jake. Do your worst Leslie, okay? I'm sorry. 
 [Leslie] What are you expecting to find? 
 [Rose] I don't know. Don't tell me you haven't done some work on this already. What have you got? 
 [Leslie] I lost my job because of Jake. Why should I help him? 
 [Rose] Because you love him. We all do. 
 So stop bluffing and tell me what you've dug up. 
 [Leslie] Alright, fine. There were three shots. 
 The first bullet went through Chandler's body, it killed him. 
 The second bullet went through that wall there. 
 [Rose] Okay. Were the bullets put into evidence? 
 [Leslie] No I checked. 
 [Rose] There's no mark from the third bullet? 
 [Leslie] The killer must have extracted it. 
 [Rose] Couldn't find the third.

 [Leslie] What do you know? 
 (Car engine) 
 [Donny] You ever gonna pay for any of those? 
 [Jake] Yeah. Later.

 [Boyd] So why'd you come back? Stockholm syndrome? 
 [Jake] No actually. I came here to find out why you killed Albert Chandler. 
 [Donny] Drop the act Jake. We all know that you killed Chandler. 
 The cops have the briefcase. The whole operation might be blown.

 [Hood] You're cold? 
 [Des] Yeah. I find it nippy, yeah. And you can just get me a sweater if you don't feel like turning up the heat. 
 [Tarrent] Just tell us where you and Malachy hid the contents of that case. 
 [Mal] You searched my home, my car, and my business, all without a warrant or probable cause, all because you found an empty briefcase. 
 [Mal] So, that'll be all then. 
 [Tarrent] They're lying. Do you feel that? 
 [Hood] What's this? 
 [Tarrent] Leslie Bennett's personnel file. She's very handy with a rifle. 
 [Hood] Meaning? 
 [Tarrent] Sergeant Hood, are you aware of the fact that Leslie Bennett holds the record for the longest sniper shot in RNC history? 
 [Hood] No. 
 [Tarrent] If Jake Doyle is involved in Chandler's death, he had to have some help. 
 [Hood] Leslie? 
 [Tarrent] I mean, until we find the evidence that Malachy Doyle is hiding, it would be worth a conversation with Leslie Bennett, wouldn't you think? 
 [Jake] Please don't tell me you've been watching me sleep. 
 [Jake] So where is everybody? 
 [Boyd] Things must be tough for you, hey Jakey boy? 
 [Jake] Are we buddies and someone forgot to tell me about it? 
 [Boyd] No life of your own. 
 Everything's about your work. 
 Your love life's a mess. 
 [Jake] Great. I've been kidnapped by my ex-wife. 
 [Boyd] It would be easy to look at a guy like you and see a man with only selfish intentions, but I don't believe that's true. 
 I think you can make the right call from time to time. 
 [Jake] Well, if it was my call, I'd get you guys to turn yourselves in, but that's probably out of the question. 
 [Boyd] I need the evidence Chandler had in his briefcase. 
 I'm gonna have to give you some incentive. 
 [Donny] - Wanna talk to him? 
 [Boyd] - Yeah. 
 [Des] Jake, Jake, I'm sorry. 
 They grabbed me, but they don't have the evidence, and the cops don't have it either. 
 [Jake] Des. 
 [Des] I'm actually safe, but I'm kinda hungry. They haven't fed me yet... 
 [Des] Wait, wait, wait! Does this bag contain nuts? I'm allergic to nuts. 
 [Jimmy] Hey, I'm allergic to nuts too. 
 [Des] Oh really? Like, all nuts? 
 [Jimmy] Totally. Yeah, I mean, I can eat seeds and stuff, but still-- 
 [Wolf] Shut up will you? 
 [Wolf] What do I do with the kid? 
 [Boyd] Bring him here. We'll chop his toes off one by one until Jake tells us what we want to know. 
 [Leslie] Look I ran the bullet and it was fired from a remington 700 sniper rifle. 
 [Rose] And? 
 [Leslie] Well, it's one of the rifles we use here in the RNC, but when I went to the ammunitions locker, the gun was missing. 
 [Rose] You think a cop pulled the trigger? 
 [Leslie] I don't know rose. 
 Honestly, I don't. And I can't help but feel that even doing this for Jake is gonna get me into even more trouble. 
 [Rose] Hey, Leslie, this isn't just about Jake, okay? 
 If you solve this thing, if you bring down the real killer, they might think of bringing you back as sergeant. 
 [Leslie] I wouldn't hold my breath. 
 [Rose] Well-- 
 [Rose] Leslie? 
 [Hood] Leslie, put it down. 
 [Tarrent] Constable, we're going to need to take you into custody. 
 [Leslie] Wait! This isn't what it looks like. 
 [Hood] Leslie Bennett, you're under arrest. 
 [Hood] Let's go. 
 [Leslie] This isn't what it looks like. I'm telling you right now Hood. 
 [Hood] Come on. 
 [Jake] Des? You alright? 
 [Des] Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. 
 How're you doing? Where are you? 
 (Truck engine) 
 [Jake] There he is. Man, nothing funnier than a bayman with a tan, what? 
 Retirement looks awful on you. 
 [Mal] Nice to see you too. 
 [Mal] I see you've made some new friends. 
 [Jake] Oh my God, where are my manners? Sorry. Malachy Doyle, meet a bunch of possible killers. Possible killers, this is my dad, Malachy Doyle. 
 [Mal] Well, I'd like to say I'm charmed, but I'm not. 
 [Donny] Package. Now. 
 [Boyd] Come on Malachy. You didn't come all the way out here for nothing. 
 [Mal] Send Des over first. 
 [Boyd] Hand the package over. Then I'll say who goes where. 
 (Seagulls) 
 [Boyd] Let the kid loose. 
 [Jimmy] Are we happy? 
 I think so. It's a bunch of discs. It'll take a while to find out what's on there. 
 [Boyd] Enjoy your retirement. 
 [Mal] If anything happens to my son, you'll be seeing me real soon, retirement or not. 
 [Boyd] Nothing's gonna happen to your son that he isn't directly responsible for. 
 [Mal] In that case, the odds aren't exactly in his favour. 
 [Boyd] You know him well. 
 (Engine starting) 
 [Boyd] Well Jake Doyle, you might even get out of this alive. 
 [Jimmy] (Laughing). We've had quite a day, you and me, huh? 
 [Jake] Yeah, Jimmy, we certainly have. 
 [Jimmy] You broke my leg. Like, three times. 
 [Jake] I'm pretty sure one of those times was actually a fracture. 
 [Boyd] Jimmy, this is not a good time to be dicking around. 
 [Jimmy] Boss, let me at least do it once. I owe him that. 
 [Wolf] Jimmy, we got the discs. Let's just go. 
 [Jimmy] What can't I get a little revenge? 
 [Jake] Jimmy, look out! 
 (Zap) 
 [Jimmy] Oh! 
 [Jimmy] Oh crap. Oh no. 
 [Jimmy] Boss, I... I didn't mean to tase you! 
 [Jake] I'll kill him! 
 [Boyd] Go, Squires. Go! 
 [Wolf] We've got to get the evidence out of here. 
 [Jake] Did you just call him Squires? 
 [Jake] Alright Boyd, I'm pretty sure I can trust you, but I can't be 100 per cent sure, so... 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Jake] I gotta throw you in the trunk while I go chase your crew. 
 (Slam) 
 (Tires screeching) 
 (Engine revving) 
 [Jimmy] I can't believe I did that. I can't friggin believe it! 
 [Wolf] What? Lit him up like a Christmas tree? 
 ♪ 
 [Jimmy] - We just left him there. 
 [Donny] - He told us to. 
 [Wolf] We should go back. 
 [Jimmy] - He's gonna kill me. 
 [Donny/Wolf] - Yup. 
 ♪ 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Jake] Yeah? 
 [Mal] Jake. Anita Squires. She died, but she left a husband. 
 [Jake] Anita Squires is Donny Squires' wife. 
 (Cars) 
 [Donny] They're from Anita. She would have been wearing a wire the night she was killed. 
 [Jimmy] Hang on. 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Mal] And that's not all. Rose thinks Donny is some kind of federal cop. 
 [Jake] They're all cops! All of them. 
 [Jake] Why didn't you tell me you were all cops, you friggin' idiot? 
 (Shouting from the trunk) 
 [Wolf] Turn back and get the boss. 
 [Jimmy] Hang on. 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Donny] Why is Jimmy driving? 
 [Wolf] Yeah, who put the gimp at the wheel? 
 ♪ 
 [Jimmy] I'm just gonna call the boss. Hang on. 
 ♪ 
 (Shouting from the trunk) 
 [Jake] Sorry! 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Wolf] - Jimmy, b'y! 
 [Jimmy] - Oh no! 
 (Crash!) 
 (Shouting from the GTO's trunk) 
 (Door sliding open) 
 (Grunting) 
 [Wolf] Jimmy's in there. 
 [Jimmy] This is your friggin fault Doyle. 
 [Jake] Alright Jimmy, listen to me, okay? 
 I'm not going to lie to you. This is going to hurt, but if I don't do it then we're all gonna die. 
 [Jimmy] Just do it. 
 [Jake] Alright, hold on. 
 (Crack) (Scream) [Jake] Sorry. (Crack/scream) [Jimmy] Oh! [Jake] Go! Go! Go! (Explosion) [Donny] The discs. ♪Yeeeah♪ [Jimmy] (Groan) [Wolf] Keep still, Jimmy, b'y. Don't be such a suck. [Jimmy] - It hurts. [Wolf] - She knows it hurts. You're breaking your leg, like 40 times or something. Drink this and shut up, will ya? [Des] So wait, you guys are all, like, cop? Like, even you? [Wolf] Special operations under cover. [Jimmy] Me, Wolf, Donny, Boyd, we've been working together a long time. There was one more of us, but she's gone. [Donny] Why are we letting him fix this? [Jimmy] Yeah, why are we letting him fix this? [Des] Uh, because I've been studying the human body. [Wolf] Anita. She was the fifth member. And Donny's wife. [Jimmy] To Anita. [Jimmy] Ow! Come on! I mean I've heard about you guys, but I didn't actually know that you really existed. [Boyd] You know, I think I chipped my tooth in the trunk. [Boyd] Your rear shocks. They're gone. You know that, right? [Jake] Yeah, I was supposed to get them fixed. I'm really sorry. [Boyd] Aw, that's alright. The tasering kind of kept me numb anyway. [Jake] So Anita Squires was Donny's wife. [Boyd] Yeah. She followed a case here. Gun trafficking, out of this port and across the country. When Chandler stepped forward, he was supposed to lead us straight to her killer. Anita was about to have some huge breakthrough in the case, and then we lost contact. And before we could act... [Donny] She was killed. Only one person knew who pulled the trigger. Chandler. (Car door slamming) [Donny] And now he's dead, and all the evidence is gone. [Jake] Dad. [Mal] Hey guys. I, uh, copied all your discs onto this just in case. Thought it might come in handy. [Boyd] You're a tad brighter than your son. [Jake] Yeah, he has his moments. [Boyd] Donny. ♪ [Tarrent] You signed out the sniper rifle that killed Chandler. [Leslie] This isn't even my hand writing. [Hood] We found the rifle in your car, and this in your purse. [Leslie] Look, I know this doesn't look good, but I had no reason to kill Chandler. [Tarrent] Reason? We can think of one reason. [Hood] Three payments of 45g's into an off shore account, deposited in your name. [Leslie] What? I didn't know about that. I wouldn't do this. [Hood] Not on your own. [Tarrent] But we know the effect that Jake Doyle can have on you. [Hood] Got these from a cctv camera. Look at what Jake's holding. Evidence from the Chandler case. [Tarrent] We believe that you and Jake Doyle conspired to murder Albert Chandler, that you pulled the trigger, and that you were paid to do it. [Anita] And did you have to drive your cruiser? Might as well turn on the siren, let everyone know I'm under cover. [Mal] She said "cruiser". [Anita] So, what did you want to meet about? [Boyd] Why is it only picking up her side of the conversation? [Anita] ...Investigating the harbor. Someone's facilitating guns getting in there. It looks big. They're using the point as a huge dropping point. They must have an inside man. I'm getting close. [Anita] Wait! How did you do that, unless-- [Anita] What are you doing? Wait. No-- (Gun shots) [Donny] She knew her killer. It was a cop. We gotta go find them Boyd. [Mal] Whatever she was trying to uncover must have been something big to her killer. [Jake] If her killer was a cop, I think I've got a way to draw them out. ♪ (Doors slamming) [Mal] So Jake, you have Chandler's evidence, and it reveals who killed Anita Squires? [Jake] Yes, I do, dad. And I'm gonna take the evidence and I'm gonna stash it at that warehouse on the southside road. 220. 220 southside road, you got it? [Mal] - 220. Got it. I'll meet you there. [Jake] - Alright. ♪ [Tarrent] I must say, this has turned out almost better than I'd planned. [Jake] Well. Well, what a turd you turned out to be. [Tarrent] I know. I facilitate the movement of guns or whatever through your little seaport, and I'm paid a generous fee for my trouble. [Jake] A few causalities here or there, who cares, right? Nothing major. [Tarrent] Give me the evidence. [Jake] Why'd you kill Anita? [Tarrent] Money, obviously. She was turning out to be a detriment to my earning skills. [Jake] Look at you, acting like some kind of criminal mastermind. [Tarrent] "Slimy PI Jake Doyle, and disgraced cop girlfriend, murder witness for the mob." 
Right now, there's enough evidence on Leslie Bennett to put her away for the shooting. And as for you-- [Donny] Sorry to interrupt your little moment. [Jake] Tarrent. [Wolf] We got enough to put you away for a long time, brother. [Donny] Anita Squires was my wife. Was. [Donny] Is that the hand you shot her with? [Jimmy] Hey, why don't we call it a day, don? [Jake] Yeah, listen to the b'ys, Donny. We got him. [Donny] Yeah, maybe you're right. (Gun shot) [Tarrent] Oh! You shot me! [Jake] You drop the gun, Donny. [Tarrent] Ah! Ah! [Boyd] Corporal Squires. Put down your weapon and step back. [Donny] We need to settle this. You of all people know that. [Boyd] Donny, Anita would not want you to do this. [Boyd] If you take this any further, it's not about her any more. [Donny] This is about Anita. [Donny] He needs to be held accountable for what he did to her. [Boyd] He will. Donny, look at me. So you winged him a little bit. It's no big deal at this point. Nobody here blames you. [Jake] He's right Donny. You know, I barely saw anything. [Wolf] Me either, Donny. [Jimmy] I'm half-blind and jacked up on whiskey and pain killers. Anyway, who am I supposed to be pointing this at again? [Boyd] Nobody do anything stupid. Jimmy? Jimmy? [Boyd] Nobody do anything stupid. [Jake] Listen to him Jimmy. Let's all just relax, okay? We'll take some deep breaths. [Boyd] Don. [Boyd] I will shoot you. [Donny] I have to do this Boyd. [Donny] I have to. (Bang) (Bang) (Bang) (Shouting & groaning) [Boyd] Paramedics Wolf. Now. ♪ [Boyd] You alright? [Donny] I I still can't believe you shot me. What a tooly thing to do to buddy, huh? [Jake] You know? [Boyd] I thought it was a fair trade, flesh wound for a lifetime in prison. Only did it because if I lose you, I'm gonna be the one putting up with Jimmy. (Quacking) [Jake] So, Jimmy. No hard feelings, right? [Jimmy] You dropped me from a building, your broke my leg, you made me taser my boss, and then you shot me in my good leg. No hard feelings? Is that a joke? [Wolf] Good to see you again, dick-smack. [Donny] Hey, thanks for the help. If it wasn't for you guys, I probably would have killed that guy. [Donny] Listen to me: Pay your parking tickets, okay? [Jake] Alright. [Boyd] You know Jake, if you're ever looking for a job, give me a call. [Jake] Well, I appreciate it, but I've gotta get rid of the one I got first, and then honestly I've got no idea what I'm gonna do. [Boyd] Don't let fear hold you back. [Boyd] Let's go. [Jimmy] Sorry for tasering you, boss. [Boyd] I know you didn't do it on purpose, and I know you're sorry, okay? So no harm done. [Jimmy] Really? Ow! [Boyd] Do it to me again, I will douse you in lamp oil, and I will make a tikki-torch out of your scrotum. ♪ [Jake] So... pint? [Mal] Oh yeah. [Jake] You'd better drive. [Rose] Well, to us? [Mal] And our last case? [Rose] Yeah. You know I... Malachy, I don't think I'm ready to retire just yet. [Mal] I mean, we're not dead, right? [Mal] There is a lot of life left in us. [Rose] I will drink to that. [Des] Hey, how's it going? What did I miss? [Des] Uh, I'll have a lime and lager, hold the lager. [Leslie] Well, after the apology for arresting me, and some other apologies... [Jake] Like being framed for killing an eye-witness kind of thing? [Leslie] Yeah. I'm a sergeant again. Fully reinstated. Record's cleared. [Jake] Well congratulations to that. [Leslie] Thank you. [Leslie] So, are we gonna be partners? [Jake] You know, I'm kinda thinking that maybe I should probably stick to the things that I'm mediocre at. In fact, I'd really appreciate it if you could return this for me. [Jake] I mean if it's not too much trouble. [Leslie] Sure. [Leslie] So now that you've decided to return to civilian life, let's make a few things perfectly clear. [Jake] Okay. [Leslie] There might have been a time when I had real feelings for you. I admit that, and I let that get in my way. But I'm not going to let you get in my way anymore. [Jake] Leslie-- So get this through your head. Your free ride in this town is over Jake Doyle. I even so much as see you cross the street towards me, I'm going to become your worst enemy. I'll bust you back to the hole you belong in. Got that? [Jake] Well now.
