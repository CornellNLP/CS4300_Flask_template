 [Narrator] Previously, on Republic of Doyle. 
 [Rose] Wanna get hitched? 
 [Mal] Yeah. I threw ya out of the house, thinkin' you'd find an apartment, not move into our new office. 
 [Leslie] Mayor Clarke, this is Jake Doyle. I know you like to do things your own way, but could you not get yourself killed doin' it? 
 [Jake] Is that your way of trying to tell me that you care? 
 [cellphone ringing] 
 [Allison] Why don't you get that? 
 [Leslie] I'm in the hospital. I've been shot. 
 [Jake] Yeah, I promise I'll be right there. 
 [Leslie] You should see the look on your face. 
 [Jake] How do I look? 
 [Leslie] Really scared. 
 [Mayor Clarke] Hi. 
 [Christian] I had a deal to open a bar with my brother... 
 [terry] I need to sell the bar, Jake. 
 [Christian] This is like our plan from way back. 
 [Jake] Where the hell is Christian getting his half? 
 [Ronnie] Mornin' Jake. 
 [Jake] What are you doin' here? 
 [Ronnie] Oh! We're uh, we're partners. 
 [Jake] How much? 
 [Ronnie] 40 grand. 
 [Jake] You put the debt on me. 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] For the love of God, Jake, you look terrible. What is wrong with you? 
 [Jake] Nothing, b'y. I just need a few painkillers. Excuse me, pardon me. 
 [Mal] How many mornings a week do you wake up hung over? 
 [Jake] Will you stop being such an old woman? Maybe a coffee would do, actually. 
 You need a kick in the arse, not a coffee. You gotta get your act together, Jake. 
 It's getting' outta hand. 
 Really! 
 [Jake] Look, why are you so interested in my life all of a sudden? Is my life that fascinating to you? 
 [Mal] No. Just hard to look away from a train wreck. 
 [Calvin] Ah, Malachy Doyle. 
 [Mal] Professor Sullivan. 
 [Calvin] Call me Calvin. 
 [Jake] How are ya, b'y? 
 [Mal] This is my son, Jake. 
 [Jake] Who do you want us to punch? 
 [Mal] What he means is how can we help you? 
 [Calvin] I think someone's after my wife. She's being harassed or worse. Breaks went out on her car, the railing at the house gave way. Things like that. I don't think they're accidents. 
 [Jake] Really? 
 [Jennifer] Oh, Calvin, tell me you didn't. 
 [Calvin] This is my wife, Jennifer, the esteemed Dr. Sullivan. 
 [Jennifer] Hi. 
 [Mal] Hi. 
 [Jennifer] My husband has a novelist's imagination. I think he just wanted the chance to meet some real private investigators. 
 [Jake] So, you don't think that anyone's really harassing you? 
 [Calvin] It's worse than harassment. 
 [Jennifer] Really, everything's fine. 
 [Dr. Ng] It is my great honour to introduce a woman who's accomplishments are known by most of you in this city... and by others around the globe. 
 [Jennifer] Oh, God... 
 [Dr. Ng] So, please join me... 
 [Calvin] You'll be just fine. 
 [Dr. Ng] In welcoming the psychiatrist of the year... 
 [Calvin] You get up there. 
 [Dr. Ng] My colleague and friend, Dr. Jennifer Sullivan. 
 [applauding] 
 [Mal] Hey, see that guy? 
11 o'clock? 
 [Jennifer] Thank you... [Mal] Seems out of place. I know him from somewhere. 
 [Jennifer] How surprised I was to hear of my nomination, even. 
 Um, I'd really like to thank my colleagues, Dr. William Ng and Dr. Ellen. Um, Dr. Ellen came to uh, came to practice um... I'm sorry. Um... oh! I um, I just uh... So surprised. I um, oh... um... 
 [Calvin] What the hell's happening? 
 [giggling] 
 [Jennifer] Oh! Excuse me. Who are you? 
 [Jake] Something's not right, here. 
 [sobbing] 
 [panting] 
 [Jake] Something's wrong. 
 [Calvin] Jen! 
 [gasping] 
 [Calvin] Jennifer! 
 [Jake] Pardon me, excuse me. 
 [Calvin] Jen? 
 [Jake] Call 9-1-1.

 [Jake] Hey. How's she doin'? 
 [Calvin] She's doin' fine. 
 [Jennifer] She's doing fine. 
 Though I think it's safe to say I'm still feeling the effects. 
 [Calvin] This was no accident. 
 [Jake] So, was that a hallucination you were having? 
 [Jennifer] Seems I've discovered a nasty interaction between medications. 
 [Calvin] I don't believe that. 
 Come on! Somebody's doing this to her. 
 [Mal] Jake... [Jake] You get some rest. I'll be right back. 
 [Mal] E.R. says it was an overdose. 
 [Jake] Of what? 
 [Mal] I don't know yet. They're runnin' a blood test. 
 [Calvin] I need you guys to figure out who's doing this before anything worse happens. 
 Two doctors she works with at the practice. Their professional rivalries, jealousy. 
 [Jake] But these are the two doctors she thanked in her speech. 
 [Calvin] But that's all an act. 
 Dr. Ng and Ellen, they hate each other and her. They're two-faced. 
 [Mal] That can happen when you work with someone for a long time. Trust me. 
 [Jake] Listen, we'll get right on this. No worries. 
 [Calvin] Thanks. 
 [cellphone ringing] 
 [Mal] Sorry, gotta go. Hi, hun! 
 I'm home. 
 [Rose] Oh! Malachy! Don't freak out, okay? 
 [Mal] Hey darling. 
 [Rose] Hi. So... 
 [Mal] Why would I freak out? 
 [Rose] Because uh... [Martin] There he is! Malachy, how's it hangin'? 
 [Mal] Get outta my house! 
 [Rose] Malachy, your heart! Your heart! 
 [Mal] Stay away from me! Stay away from her when I met her! 
 [Martin] You got me all wrong, here. I'm just here to help! 
 [Rose] We don't want your help. 
 [Martin] I was just thinking, "How can I thank these two?" 
 That's all I was thinking. You know, you're practically family, now. 
 [Rose] Well, we're disowning you. 
 [Martin] Look at this face, what do you see? Come on, don't answer that. I'm happy! Can't you see it? Isn't it obvious? 
 And I owe it all to you two. 
 [Mal] Really? 
 [Martin] Yeah! I've got some cash, now. Hit a nice little investment deal up there, in Montreal... pretty sweet. 
 [Rose] What he's saying is he bet all his money on the fights and he won. 
 [Martin] When I got word back that...You guys are in this little jam... in a spot up here. 
 [Mal] What spot? 
 [Rose] What game are you playing at, Martin? 
 [Martin] Oh, no. They haven't said a word to you two. 
 Unbelievable. Well, don't shoot the messenger. Last thing I want to do is travel all the way to newfoundland to be the bearer of bad news. 
 [Rose] Why change now? 
 [Martin] What was I thinking? I shouldn't have meddled. Should have just kept my big fat mouth shut! Okay, look, you sit your boys down, you ask 'em what they're into, then you come and see me. And I provide the solution, okay? 
 [Rose] Get out. 
 [Martin] Trust me. 
 [Rose] Don't trust you. Get out. 
 [Martin] You actually kind of need my help this time. 
 [Rose] Go. Don't come back. 
 [Martin] So, I'll hear from you? 
 [Rose] And I mean it! 
 [Mal] Jake and Christian... Is he messing with us? 
 [Rose] Malachy, I have no idea. 
 I'm just sorry I brought him into your life. 
 [Mal] Don't worry about it. You okay? 
 [Rose] Yeah, fine. 
 [Mal] You sure? 
 [Rose] I'm fine! 
 [Jake] Hi. 
 [Allison] Hi. 
 [Jake] I was stakin' out your hotel for days and you never came home, so... 
 [Allison] That's kind of creepy, no? 
 [Jake] Well, yeah, I guess. 
 [clearing throat] 
 [Allison] You know what? Not only did you ruin a deposition for me, professionally, but you left me standing half-naked in your apartment. You know what, Jake, I think this is goodbye. 
 [Jake] No, no. Just give me a second, okay? Let me explain. 
 Ah... a friend of mine got... Shot. And uh... I had to take off. And I know it was wrong of me to uh, not tell you. To leave you there like that. I know that and I'm sorry. 
 [Allison] It's still goodbye, Jake. 
 [Thomas] Hey. 
 [Allison] Hi. 
 [Thomas] You ready to go? 
 [Allison] Yeah. 
 [car alarm turning off] 
 [Jake] Anything I can do to make it up to you? Let me take you out to dinner. 
 [Allison] That would have to be some dinner. I'm not sayin' no. 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] Christian... I need to talk to you, if you don't mind. 
 [Christian] Sounds serious. Everything okay? 
 [Mal] You tell me. Are you... What are you into? 
 [Christian] What am I into? 
 Nothing! What are you talking about? 
 [Mal] Okay, look... this is a gift. One time offer. A get outta jail free card. You come clean with me now and I'll... 
 [Christian] Or you'll... ground me? It's what you used to say to me as a kid. You okay, or what? 
 [Ma] I'm serious! 
 [Christian] Dad... there's nothing. You sure you're okay? 
 [Mal] Yeah. Someone rattlin' my cage. Sorry. 
 ♪ 
 [door buzzing] 
 [Jake] So, Dr. Sullivan...She's had 3 alleged attempts on her life. To... 
 [Mal] I have to talk to you! 
 [Jake] About what? 
 [Mal] I don't know yet. 
 [Jake] That's deep. Do you mind if we keep working while you search for inner-meaning? 
 Suspects? 
 [Rose] Uh, well, let's see, we've got Dr. Ng and Dr. Ellen. 
 Haven't got much on this guy, yet, he's some kind of researcher. "Doctor-one-name", here... 
[Jake] She really goes by one name? 
 [Des] Yeah, yeah! Like Dr. Phil! 
 Oh, I... which I don't watch. I just saw clips online one time. 
 Uh, d... 
 It's okay. "Dr. Ellen and the inner ego". 
 [Des] Oh, yeah! Sullivan wrote a review on it. Check it! 
 [Rose] Sorry, sorry. 
 [Des] Uh, "Psychiatry, an Unforgettable Art, One Forgettable Book." 
Talk about a headline. 
 [Jake] It's a bit harsh. 
 [Rose] Not really, it's a crappy book. I read it. And, she has another one coming out in about a month. 
 [Jake] So, what? She tries to kill Sullivan because she's afraid of a bad review? It seems a little extreme. 
 [Des] Some people are actually allergic to criticism. Me, I actually really enjoy it. 
 [Mal] And then, there's Joseph Otis, ex-cop. I know I recognised him. Skulkin' around the ceremony. I knew him years ago. He was undercover with a bunch of drug dealers and people thought he was going in too deep. 
 [Jake] So? What does that have to do with Sullivan? 
 [Rose] Uh, well, they sent him to see Sullivan and she recommended he be taken off the force. Honourable discharge. 
 [Jake] Now, that speaks to a motive. Do you have an address on this guy? 
 [Rose] Yeah, workin' on it. 
 [Jake] What is your problem? 
 [Mal] Why don't you tell me? 
 [Jake] Paranoid much? 
 [telephone ringing] 
 [Jake] Hey there. How you doin'? 
 Are you uh, are you back to work, yet? 
 [Leslie] Yes, first day, today. 
 I start this afternoon. 
 Great. So what? Cop gets shot, they don't send 'em on an all-inclusive to Cuba? 
 [Leslie] Not when it barely leaves a scar. I uh... I wanted to talk to ya. 
 [Jake] Okay. Um... Everything all right? 
 [Leslie] Yeah, I wanted to... Straighten things out with us. I didn't want to be sending ya mixed signals. 
 [Jake] Sounds pretty complicated. 
 [Leslie] No, it's not. Not with me. 
 [Jake] Well, I guess it isn't for me, either, then. 
 [Leslie] Good. It's all I wanted to know. So, we're friends. 
 Colleagues, let's leave it at that. Okay? 
 [Jake] All right. 
 [Leslie] I'll see ya around. 
 [Des] Okay, so... It could be any one of her patients, right? 
 And due to doctor-patient confidentiality... We don't have any photos. But, imagine, if you will, a possible psychotic, crazed killer on our hands and we wouldn't even know it. 
 [Des] I'm going to go undercover, in as a patient. 
 [Mal] Excellent idea. 
 [Rose] Terrific! 
 [Des] Yeah, I third that motion. 
 ♪ 
 [Nikki] You had me at referral. 
 I've been dying to do this practically since we met. 
 [Jake] Oh, well... Thanks for the boost of confidence. 
 [Nikki] Look, I know this is probably just for a case, but I think you should take advantage of this; figure out your weird relationship with women. 
 [Jake] I don't have a weird relationship with women. A complex, maybe, but, you know, whatever. 
 [Nikki] Hey, are you okay? You seem off. Like, freaked. 
 [Jake] I'm not freaked. 
 [Nikki] We were married. I know you freaked when I see it. 
 [Jake] I'm fine. 
 [Nikki] Look, sooner or later, you're going to find what you're looking for. I think you already know what it is you want. 
 [Jake] Really? 
 [Nikki] Look after yourself, okay? And have fun with the shrink. 
 [Jake] Thanks. 
 [Cindy] Yes, professor Sullivan, I will order them right away. 
 I'm glad, too. So sorry. That was one of our doctor's husbands. She's sick and he wants me to order flowers. 
 [Jake] I guess even doctors get sick from time to time, right? 
 [Cindy] Dr. Ellen's ready to see you, Mr. Doyle. Do you want some tea? 
 [Jake] Uh, nope. Just sympathy. 
 It's a joke; Tea and sympathy, it's a book, right? 
 [Cindy] Yeah. I got it. I was an English major. 
 [clearing throat] 
 [Jake] Thanks. 
 [Dr. Ellen] Make yourself comfortable. You can lie on the couch if you like. 
 [Jake] I'm uh... I'm comfortable. 
 [sighing] 
 [Dr. Ellen] Relax. Phew... 
 [Jake] Oh, I'm uh... phew, relaxed. 
 [Dr. Ellen] Why have you come to see me, today? 
 [Jake] All right, well... 
 [Clearing throat] 
 [Jake] Money. You know, and women. Women, mostly. I just went through a divorce a while back. And uh, I think I'm in love with a cop who... Was just shot and I'm seeing this other woman who's... amazing. In fact, all 3 of them are far, far, far too good for me. 
 [Dr. Ellen] It's a lot... It's a lot to be carrying on your shoulders. 
 [Jake] This actually feels a lot better than I ever thought it would. You know, just talking like this. I don't usually get a chance. 
 [exhaling deeply] 
 [Jake] My brother... He borrowed a bunch of money from a loan shark, and now, I think my... My father, he's sniffing around. I think he's gonna figure it out. 
 [Dr. Ellen] All you need to remember... Is to think of nothing... but yourself. 
 [Jake] Sorry, what was that, now? 
 [Dr. Ellen] Self-love. 
 [Jake] Are you saying that I should play with myself more? 
 [Dr. Ellen] Put yourself before others. 
 [Jake] That really sounds like terrible advice. 
 [Dr. Ellen] No, it's not. Trust me. 
 [Jake] I'd like to. But, maybe I should go see another doctor. 
 You know? Maybe one in this clinic. Dr. Sullivan, maybe? I hear she's the best psychiatrist in the world. 
 [Dr. Ellen] You can go see another doctor, if my advice doesn't suit you. Sure. 
 [Jake] That's big of you, because I stumbled upon this. A review of your book by Dr. Sullivan. 
"Psychiatry, An Unforgettable Art, One Forgettable Book." Doesn't that just make you wanna... kill her? 
 [Dr. Ellen] Why... why would you bring that up? What's wrong with you? 
 [Jake] Does it bother you that you don't have Dr. Sullivan's approval? 
 [Dr. Ellen] Does it bother you that you don't have your father's approval? That he loves your brother more? 
 [Jake] God, no. It's easier. 
 That way, I have less of a distance to fall. And we all fall... eventually. 
 [Dr. Ellen] Okay, why have you really come here? 
 [Joseph] Don't lie to me! 
 [Cindy] She isn't here! 
 [Joseph] Stop lying to me! 
 [Cindy] She's not here! 
 [Joseph] They said she left the hospital to come here! 
 [Cindy] She isn't in, today! 
 [Dr. Ng] What the hell's going on out here? 
 [Joseph] Don't lie to me. 
 [Cindy] I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
 [Jake] Okay... buddy, let's just do what the girl says, all right? 
 [Joseph] Or what? You just stay out of this! This isn't about you! 
 [Dr. Ellen] Cindy, call security. 
 [Joseph] Don't do that! 
 [Jennifer] Joseph! What are you doing here? 
 [Joseph] I leave you messages and you don't return my calls? 
 [Jennifer] Calm down. It's okay. 
 Joseph, I'm... I'm sorry I didn't call you, but we've been over this before and you have to respect boundaries. 
 [Joseph] If you don't watch it, something bad is going to happen to you. 
 [Doyle] Okay! That's enough! 
 [Jennifer] Joseph, I'm going to have Cindy call you and set up a meeting. 
 [Joseph] If you don't watch it, somethin's gonna happen to you and I'm not gonna be able to stop it. 
 [Cindy] Should I call Calvin? 
 [Jennifer] No, no. Cindy, that's okay. I'll call my husband. Why don't you take a break and um... Clear my schedule. 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] I don't know, I talked to Christian, he's such a terrible liar. Who knows what he's hiding? 
 [Rose] Well, don't let your imagination get the best of you. 
 [Martin] Now there's what you like to see; A happy couple. I thought you were gettin' back to me. Maybe I'm thinkin' my phone's broken. 
 [Mal] Martin, this is startin' to get really old. Go away. 
 [Rose] We're done with you. We don't want to have to tell you again. 
 [Martin] I'm not lookin' to cause any trouble, here. 
 [Mal] Stop playing games with us, Martin, I'm startin' to lose my patience. 
 [Martin] See, your sons aren't talkin' to ya, are they? Because they're all jammed up. And it was not me that led them down this path to temptation. They did that on their own. I'm just here to help. 
 [Mal] You want me to bite? Fine. What are they into? 
 [Martin] Wait, do you know uh, little skinny rat? Uh, a 6 to 5 guy, goes by "Big Fat Ronnie"? 
 [exhaling deeply] 
 [Mal] Bar. The down payment. How much? 
 [Martin] 40. That's what I'm sayin'. You don't have to worry, because you know what? I'm going to give you this money straight out. There's no strings, here. 
 No interest, no nothin'. Call it a "thank you" call it "I'm sorry". I don't care, okay? You don't even have to pay me back. 
 [Mal] You know what, Martin? My sons are the idiots, not me. 
 I don't want your money. 
 [Martin] I'm on the level, here. 
 Rosie, tell him. Unbelievable. 
 [Jake] You gonna explain that little outburst just now? 
 [Jennifer] Oh, Joseph... Really, I'm not at liberty to discuss any of my patients, Mr. Doyle. 
 [Jake] Right. Weren't you the doctor responsible for having... 
 Joseph removed from the force? 
 [Jennifer] He's going through a really difficult time. Now, I know my husband asked you to look into things. But really... what about you? 
 [Jake] Me? What about me? 
 [Jennifer] You look like you're going through a hard time. 
 [Jake] Well, thank you. I'm fine, actually. 
 [Jennifer] You know, Cindy's cancelled all my appointments today, all ready. We could talk. 
 [Jake] You and me? 
 [Jennifer] Mmm-hmm. 
 [Jake] Talk-talk? 
 [Jennifer] Mmm-hmm! 
 [Jake] I think we should focus on the task at hand, don't you? 
 [Jennifer] You're afraid to open the vault to the inner-workings of Jake Doyle. I'm sure it's nothing to be scared of. 
 [Jake] Well, I think it's better that we never find out, don't you? 
 [Jennifer] How, 'bout some tea? 
 It's calming. We can just... Sit for a bit. See what happens. I know tea will make me feel better. Really. How long have you, uh, have you been a private investigator? 
 [Jake] A few years. I was a cop for a bit before that. A small bit. 
 [Jennifer] Hmm. And-and Calvin says that you work with your father. What's that like? 
 [Jake] It's fine. 
 [Jennifer] Fine? 
 [Jake] Yeah, fine. He's a pain in the arse, but I love him. 
 [Jennifer] What about your mother? 
 [Jake] She died when I was a kid. 
 [Jennifer] Is that why you have trouble trusting women? 
 [Jake] Oh, I don't think my problem with women is not trusting them. 
 [Jennifer] Oh, shoot, I forgot to plug in the kettle. 
 [Jake] Please, allow me. 
 [Jennifer] You know, you're just demonstrating that you like to help... particularly women, I would think. And you're avoiding the conversation. 
 [Jake] Oh, no, doctor... I'm pretty sure you're the one who's avoiding the conversation. Someone's trying to hurt you. 
 [Jennifer] You're being ridiculous. There is nobody trying to do anything to me. 
 [electrical buzzing] 
 [Jennifer] Oh, my God! Jake! Look at me. Can you look at me? Cindy? Cindy! 
 
 
 
 [Mal] What did I say about playin' with electricity? He was always sticking his fingers in sockets as a kid. 
 [Jake] Look dad, I'm telling you, this is no accident, all right? Somebody rigged that outlet with a charge. 
 [Nkiki] Jake... 
 [Mal] Rose tracked down Joe Otis, her ex-drug cop. He's an electrician, now. 
 [Jake] Really? So, first he tries to drug Sullivan, then what? He tries to electrocute her? 
 [Nikki] Jake! 
 [Mal] We should call the cops. 
 [Jake] Well, we could go to the cops, except for you know, Sullivan won't even admit that any of this is happening. Please! 
 [Nikki] If you made a stronger connection with that current... 
 [Jake] I'd have super-powers, now? Thank you. 
 [Mal] You sure he's okay? 
 [Nikki] Don't worry, Mal. He'll be fine. 
 [Mal] He can handle a little stress? 
 [Nikki] You are so sweet, the way you worry about him. He's fine. He's 100%. 
 [Mal] Thanks, Nikki. So, both my sons are up to their armpits in debt... to a criminal? 
 [Jake] Just... calm down. 
 [Mal] I will not calm down! 
 [sighing] 
 [Mal] You borrowed $40,000 from a loan shark. You're a moron! 
 And you dragged Christian into this? 
 [Jake] Who told you about this? 
 [Mal] Don't change the subject. 
 You act like this is no big deal. Ronnie might be small-time, but if this debt gets too large, if you stop paying the interest, he'll get real heavy, real fast. Then I'll have to deal with it all. 
 [Jake] Look, you have no idea what the real story is, here, okay? So mind your own business. I got it covered. 
 [Mal] Yeah, I can see that. 
 [Jake] Would you just give me a little credit here, please? Just...

 [Rose] Hey, good timing. Guys, blood work's in on Sullivan; She was drugged with an L.S.D.-like substance. 
 [Des] Plus, Sullivan and the-the... 
 [Rose] Ng. 
 [Des] Ng. Uh, they're co-owners of aewew psychotherapeutic drug that he's deve experimenting with hallucinogens for psychiatric treatment. It was supposed to hit the market months ago. 
 [Jake] So? Why didn't it? 
 [Rose] Because Dr. Sullivan called for new trials. 
 [Jake] So, Ng was set to make a truckload of cash and she was the only thing standing in his way. 
 [Mal] And if Dr. Sullivan were to meet with a tragic accident, say, an accidental overdose... 
 [Des] He'd be clear of her and he could push the drug through and get rich. 
 [Jake] What about uh, Dr. Ellen, here? 
 [Rose] Oh, yeah, I got her last name, here. It's uh, Gre-kor-vres-kin-kov. 
 [Des] Grekorvreskinkov. Someone needs to buy a vowel! 
 [Jake] Look into her. All right? 
 Apparently, Sullivan's questioning her professionalism. 
 I'll check out Ng. 
 [Des] Man, you look terrible. 
 [Mal] Yeah. Someone nearly sent enough volts through him to knock some sense into his big, fat head. 
 [Jake] Ugh! Look, do me a favour, all right? You go see the ex-cop-turned-electrician. 
 He's still my number one suspect. For riggin' that friggin' outlet. 
 [Des] I don't like pluggin' anything in. I've actually air-dried my hair for years for that very reason. Try it. It works, obviously. Hey, hey! It's 5 o'clock somewhere. I wouldn't say no. Huh? 
 [Rose] Yeah, but I would.

 [Dr. Ng] I don't talk about my personal life with my patients. 
 [Jake] I have some issues, you know? Family issues, mostly. 
 Moron brother issues more to the point. 
 [Dr. Ng] Right. 
 [Jake] Somehow, I ended up with uh, a big loan with a bunch of loan sharks... Well, a loan shark, actually... 
 [Dr. Ng] Okay! I'm gonna stop you there. I'm not really that kind of doctor. The uh, "let's talk about our feelings" kind. I concentrate more on pharmaceutical therapy. 
 [Jake] Well, I'm not that into drugs. 
 [Dr. Ng] I'm sure there's medication that can help you. 
 [Jake] Do you ever worry about money, doctor? 
 [Dr. Ng] I don't talk about my personal life... 
 [Jake] With your patients. 
 Right. What about Sullivan? 
 [Dr. Ng] Excuse me? 
 [Jake] Dr. Sullivan; she knows a lot about drugs, too, right? 
 [cellphone ringing] 
 [Dr. Ng] I'm sorry. I have to get this. What'd you find out?
