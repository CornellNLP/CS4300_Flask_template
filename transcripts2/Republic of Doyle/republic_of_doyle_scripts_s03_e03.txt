 Previously on Republic of Doyle... 
 [Mal] You are the worst I've ever seen when it comes to courting women. 
 [Molly] Take off your clothes. 
 [Jake] Excuse me? 
 [Mal] It's like a reverse talent. 
 [Leslie] It's only a matter of time before somebody really gets hurt. 
 And you're the one who is gonna have to live with it. 
 [Jake] Ned Bishop. Nice to see you again. 
 [Ned] I went bankrupt. 
 [Des] Am I dead? 
 [Chandra] Well, your heart's beating pretty fast. 
 [Jake] There was a woman. She had a gun. 
 [Leslie] I don't even want to know. 
 [Jake] There's something a lot bigger going on here. 
 [Leslie] Not from where I'm standing. 
 [Nikki] David is a really good guy, Jake. 
 [Jake] I can see how dinner with you and your new fiance would be fun for you. 
 But me, not so much. 
 [Tinny] I'm going to London. 
 I get to go for a year! 
 [Des] Oh my God! 
 [Tinny] Oh my God. 
 [Des] How long have you been home? 
 [Tinny] I never left. 
 [Des] - Um... 
 [Tinny] - Hey guys. I'm home. 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Mal] How in the love of God did I let you get me into this Jake? 
 [Jake] Oh lord! Oh the smell. 
 [Mal] The body is rancid. It stinks. Gotta get it to the cops quick. We gotta move it! 
 [Jake] Oh, yes b'y. How are we going to explain to the cops why we have a dead body, and that it's covered in friggin' white flour? 
 [Mal] I think I'm gonna throw up. 
 [Jake] Don't you dare throw up in the car dad. 
 Don't throw up in this car! 
 [Mal groaning] I'll-- 
I'll pull up here. I'll pull up here! 
 (Tires screeching) 
 [Jake] (Coughing) 
 Oh my God! 
 [Mal] Oh, that's disgusting. 
 [Jake] Let's get him in the trunk. 
 [Jake] Go get some ice. 
 (Groaning) 
 [Jake] Help me get him in the trunk.

 [Jake] What b'y what? 
 [Mal] We're running a trading pulse now? Our last client, let them pay with belt buckle. 
 [Jake] Oh seriously, dad, can't this wait or what? 
 [Mal] No, where are you? 
 [Jake] I'm... on a safari. 
 You're lucky your buddy paid you at all, okay? He was a degenerate gambler. 
 [Mal] 20 minutes, curiosity shop. 
 You do the haggling. 
 [Jake] Dad-- (Dog barking) 
♪ 
 [Mal] So Tinny didn't say anything about London? I thought you were gonna work her. 
 [Rose] I did. Okay? I got nothing. London was great, school was great. Says she just wanted to come home. 
 [Mal] Yeah, there's more going on here. Keep pushing it. 
 What about the high school? 
 [Rose] Still making me jump through hoops to get her registered. It's bizarre. 
 [Mal] Okay. Thanks for taking care of it. I'll call you later. 
 [Mal] This better be worth at least four days at our regular rate. Plus expenses. 
 [Jake] You're telling me you couldn't do this by yourself or what? 
 [Mal] I figured you wouldn't be above begging. 
 You smell like cheap whiskey. 
 [Jake] Well, it is cheap whiskey because I stole it from your friggin liquor cabinet. 
 [Jake] Ned Bishop? 
 Ned, what are you doing? 
 How many jobs you got, man? 
 [Ned] I happen to have an alimony issue with a certain ex-wife. 
 But thank you for poking that open wound. And that buckle is only worth 20 bucks, tops. 
 [Jake] 20 bucks my arse. Give me that. Look, I'm telling you. 
 Look at this. This is solid platinum, and these here, they're diamonds. 
 [Ned] Those are glass gems and that is platinum plated. I have reduced my offer to $18.50. 
 [Mal] Oh lord. Put your tongue back in your head. 
 [Marie] Hey. 
 [Ned] Oh, back again, are you my lucky? 
 What can I do you for today? 
 [Marie] Look, I'm sorry to do this to you Ned, but I need that cigarette case. I got your money. 
 [Ned] Oh, I'm sorry love. I sold this first thing this morning. 
 [Marie] What? Come on, Ned. I just sold that to you yesterday! 
 [Jake] Uh, listen, uh-- (Ding) 
 Ha. Ned, who did you sell the case to? I mean, do you got a name, a visa statement or whatever? 
 [Ned] Jake Doyle, here. 
 He fancies himself a bit of private dick. 
 Mind your own business Jake. 
 [Marie] Hi, I'm Marie booth. 
 [Jake] Hi Marie booth. So what do you say Ned? 
 The girl obviously wants her cigarette case back, so just tell us who bought it. 
 [Ned] I don't know. Somebody, alright? I don't know, b'y. 
 [Deacon] Where is it? Did you get it back? 
 [Marie] No, I'll find it, okay Deacon? 
 Please! I said I'd find it. 
 [Deacon] I told you I need that case. 
 [Jake] Hey! 
 Let's just relax, there, alright chachi. 
 [Deacon] Did anyone ask me to ask you anything? Marie, if I don't get that case-- 
 [Jake] - Whoa! Excuse me. Sorry. 
 It's obvious to me that you're the thick, stupid type. 
 [Marie] Deacon, no! 
 (Scuffling) 
 [Ned] Come on guys. I just got this job. I need the money now! 
 [Marie] Okay, okay, okay. I said I would get it back, so I'll get it back, okay? 
 [Jake] Ow! Just relax, okay? 
 (Thud) 
 [Mal] That had to hurt son. 
 (Thud) 
 [Marie] Oh my God. 
 [Jake] It's all under control. 
 (Crash!) 
 [Jake] Little help here? 
 [Mal] You're getting cocky, see? 
 (Crash!) 
 (Thud) 
 [Deacon] You stay out of my business, or you'll wish you'd never been existed. 
 [Jake] What? 
 [Deacon] 24 hours Marie. I want it back or there's going to be serious trouble. 
 [Mal] What was your strategy exactly? I was having a hard time following it. 
 [Jake] Just shut up, alright? 
 [Marie] You alright? 
 [Ned] B'ys, somebody's paying for this. 
 [Marie] Oh, I'm so, so sorry. 
 Are you okay? 
 [Jake] That was nothing, I'm fine. 
 [Mal] He's fine. His head absorbed most of the fall. 
 ♪ 
 [Marie] Deacon and I were together for a few months, and then I kicked him out. It just wasn't working. 
 [Jake] I can't believe you used to go out with this bonehead. 
 I mean, he just doesn't seem like your type. 
 [Marie] I packed up his stuff, I locked him out, and he owes me 3 grand in rent, so he brought the cigarette case home and I sold it, and now he's freaking out. 
 [Des] Jake-o, I got something for you. 
 Hi. 
 [Marie] Hi. 
 [Jake] We'll find you-- we'll find your cigarette case. I promise I'll keep Deacon off your back while we do it. 
 [Mal] Hard to do it that from your arse. 
 Get another son you know. Strong as an ox. 
 Single too. 
 Speak of the devil. 
 The strong one. 
 [Jake] - Oh... 
 [Christian] - Who's this now? 
 [Jake] This is just great. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Jake] Excuse me for a second? 
 [Jake] Nikki, can this wait? I'm kind of with a client right now. 
 [Marie] Hi, I'm Marie. 
 [Mal] This is Christian. He owns his own bar downstairs. 
 [Christian] Yes, indeed I do. 
 [Jake] Half owns it. 
 [Nikki] I need to meet you. 
 [Jake] What? Meet me where? 
 When? 
 [Nikki] Now. It's super important. I need to talk to you. 
 Please. It's just-- it's a favour. Please? 
 [Jake] Okay, okay. Just do me a favour, alright? 
 Just give me a few minutes. I'll be there as soon as I can. 
 [Nikki] Thank you Jake. I really appreciate this. 
 [Des] Uh, I went through all the security footage at the curiosity shop, and I found this. 
 [Jake] How do you know this is the right cigarette case? 
 [Des] Because it's the only cigarette case that they sold today. 
 [Christian] I almost cut you off. 
 [Marie] (Laughs) 
 [Christian] Probably. 
 [Jake] Anyways, do you recognize this guy? 
 [Christian] Well, I should probably be going. 
 Hey, little brother. 
 Don't get beat up again. 
 [Jake] Goodbye. 
 [Marie] Bye. 
 [Jake] (Clears throat) 
 Photograph ring any bells? 
 [Marie] No I've never seen that guy before. 
 [Mal] Logo's from Michele's bakery. 
 [Jake] Maybe we should go to Michele's and see if he's working a shift. We can drop you off at home on the way if you'd like. 
 [Des] Okay, I'll see you guys later. Have fun. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Des] Des Courtney. 
 Doyle and Doyle investigation, senior p.I. What's up? 
 [Tinny] Are you keeping your mouth shut? 
 [Des] Yes-- no. 
 What are we talking about? 
 [Tinny] Did you tell anyone about finding me in town? 
 Rose is digging. 
 [Des] Look, Tinny, I told you, okay? My word is good. 
 [Tinny] You're in this with me now, Courtney. Accessory after the fact. 
 [Des] What's?-- Hello? 
 ♪ 
 (Doors slamming) 
 [Mal] You know, you might have had a shot with Marie until Deacon tossed you through that window. 
 [Jake] I I slipped. 
 [Mal] And that you have, my son. 
 And Christian, oh man, he's really coming into his own. The hair, the build. He could have handled that Deacon like it was nothing. 
 [Jake] You know, turning son against son is beyond how low I thought you could go. 
 [Kelly] Deacon, shut up! Idiot. 
 No. 
 [Jake] Hey. 
 [Kelly] No! 
 [Jake] Kelly? 
 [Kelly] Call you back. 
 [Jake] How are you making out? 
 [Kelly] Fine. 
 [Jake] I'm Jake. This is a... a senior citizen I have in my care, Malachy. 
 [Kelly] Kelly Thomas. 
 [Mal] Listen, we wanna track down a cigarette case you bought. 
 [Kelly] Cigarette case? I don't know anything about a cigarette case. 
 [Jake] I have a picture of you buying a cigarette case earlier today. 
 [Mal] We just wanna buy it back from you. There's no trouble. 
 [Kelly] Right, sorry. I forgot. 
 I'll just go, uh... See if it's around. 
 [Jake] What's with him? 
 [Mal] I don't know. Kind of defensive. 
 [Jake] Well, he did happen to leave his cell phone behind. 
 [Jake] 25 calls to Deacon? 
 That's Marie's ex-boyfriend. 
 [Mal] Maybe Kelly wanted to sell him back the case. 
 (Whack!) 
 [Jake] Ow! What the hell? 
 What the hell, man! 
 (Strikes) 
 [Jake] What the hell's wrong with you?! 
 (Whack!) 
 [Jake] Get out of here! 
 Ow. 
 [Jake] Well, we got the case. 
 [Mal] - Hate to say it, but uh-- 
 [Jake] - What? What? Christian would have done that better? 
 I got the case, don't I?! 
 [Jake] So what? Deacon gives Kelly the case, Marie-- oh whatever. I'm just gonna give this back to Marie and get it over with. 
 [Mal] Listen to yourself. 
 [Jake] What? 
 [Mal] You almost get your head taken off twice over this, and now you're just going to hand it back to that girl with no idea of what your libido has dragged us into? 
 [Jake] What the hell is wrong with you today? 
 [Mal] In case you haven't noticed, I'm trying to prove a point here. 
 [Jake] That you're a dick-smack? 
 [Mal] This morning you woke up somewhere, God knows where, hung over as hell. Now you're following some girl around, getting the crap beat out of you every 2 minutes. I'm telling you, you're regressing. And the place you're regressing from was nothing to be proud of. 
 [Jake] That's a hell of a pep talk. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Mal] - Look... 
 [Rose] - Mal, I need you home. 
 Now. 
 [Mal] Okay. 
 I gotta go. 
 [Jake] How're you gonna get home? 
 [Mal] None of your business! 
 ♪ 
 [Mal] Well obviously there's been a mistake at their end. 
 [Rose] The principal says that they've double and triple checked. 
 [Mal] So let them check again. 
 She was over there a full semester. 
 [Rose] The school in London has no record of Tinny whatsoever. 
 They say she never enrolled. 
 [Tinny] That's ridiculous. Of course I enrolled. How's I supposed to go to school if I never enrolled? 
 [Mal] I'll call them myself. 
 [Rose] The school here says she may have to repeat the entire year. 
 [Tinny] What? Poppy? 
 [Mal] I know kiddo. This isn't your fault. Look, I'll not let you get held back because of some bureaucratic foolishness. 
 What's the number? 
 (Phone ringing) 
 [Rose] No, it's okay. I'll call myself. 
 [Mal] Okay, thank you. Good. 
 Tinny, you must have some receipts or something upstairs. 
 I gotta go. 
 [Mal] (To phone) I'm on my way. 
 (Door shutting) 
 [Nikki] Hi, where are you? 
 [Jake] Look, I am so sorry. 
 I had a thing, which, you know, kind of turned into another-- 
 [Nikki] I knew it. I knew it. 
 [Jake] ...Thing. 
 [Nikki] Jake, you always pull this when I need you. 
 [Jake] No, no, no, it's just, you see, that my super-hot ex-wife, see she really-- what? 
 [Nikki] Jerk. 
 [Jake] So? What do you want? 
 I'm here. What? 
 [Nikki] Okay. Come here. 
 [Nikki] I think-- I think I need to hire you. 
 I think. 
 Is that crazy? 
 That sounds crazy, right? 
 [Jake] Nikki? What's wrong. 
 [Nikki] Just something... I can't shake it, Jake. I have this really bad feeling that something isn't right. It's David. I think he's having an affair. 
 [Jake] You think that David's cheating? 
 Nikki, David is not cheating on you. 
 Look, listen to me. 
 First of all, he's a divorce attorney, he knows better. 
 Second of all, he knows you're way, way too hot for him. 
 [Nikki] A couple of nights ago, he said he was meeting with a client. Then I phoned him at the office and he wasn't there. And there were a couple of other things. 
 [Jake] Nikki! Stop! 
 Okay? 
 Do not go down this road. 
 I'm telling you. 
 I've been here before. 
 There is no turning back, so just stop it. 
 [Nikki] Okay, maybe you're right. 
 [Jake] Do me a favour, okay? You go home, you look him in the eye, and you see for yourself. 
 [Nikki] Okay. 
 Thanks.

 [Des] Okay, so there were 18,743 auction listing for "cigarette case" online, and yet I can't find even one hall and oates autograph. 
 [Rose] Really? 
 [Des] I know, especially because they're the greatest selling duo of all time. 
 [Rose] No dear, the cigarette cases. 
 [Des] Oh, right, yeah. Oh sorry. 
 Uh, okay, of course. So after all that, I honed in on this. 
 [Jake] Deacon spent a thousand bucks on that cigarette case? 
 [Mal] Deacon doesn't strike me as the expensive online collectables type. 
 [Des] No, no, he's not. It was actually bought by a guy named Edwin Winters. 
 [Rose] "Divorce break your heart? Bring us your gold ring for a fresh start". 
 [Des] That's the guy! 
 [Rose] Edwin Winters is one of those guys that buys gold. 
 [Des] Yeah, and jewelry. 
 "Got diamonds and pearls? 
 Bring 'em to Ed's jewelry world". 
 [Jake] What's the connection between Edwin Winters and Deacon? 
 [Rose] Uh, Deacon does his yard work. 
 [Mal] He's been stealing from his boss. Rose, you got an address? 
 [Rose] I can get one. 
 [Jake] Des, can I speak to you about this cigarette case for a second? 
 [Des] Oh cool. 
 [Jake] What do you got? 
 [Des] I didn't wear your leather jacket to the mall. And I have no idea where Tinny was living in London, so don't ask. 
 [Jake] No. The information about David? 
 [Des] Oh right. 
 Here you go. But, hang on. 
 Permission to speak freely? 
 [Jake] No. 
 [Des] It's just, are you sure this is such a good idea? I mean, it's your ex-wife and your ex-wife's new husband. I mean, okay, look. I've just got experience with being torn between two lovers and-- ow! 
 [Jake] Des, when did I ever, ever ask for your personal insight. 
 What's in the file? 
 [Des] That hurts b'y. It's all there. Criminal check. 
 Medical, financial report. Man, he makes a lot of money. 
 [Jake] I need you to follow him and don't tell anybody about this or I'll kill you. 
 [Des] Okay, you got it. 
 I'm on it. 
 [M] What are you two whispering about? 
 [Jake] Nothing. Des has fleas. 
 [Des] Uh... "Had". 
 I had fleas. 
 Long... 
[Jake] - Are you coming? 
 [Des] Okay. Subject, David. 
 David being Nikki's new husband. 
 Nikki being Jake Doyle's ex-wife. Jake Doyle being my boss and mentor. 
 Okay, okay-- oh... oh, subject has turned to page 16 of the newspaper. 
 [Tinny] Hey. 
 [Des] Hey. 
 [Tinny] It smells like mango lip-gloss in here. 
 [Des] No, no. That's just carpet cleaner stuff. 
 [Tinny] Dessie, how tough would it be to forge a British high school transcript. 
 [Des] You realize you're talking about fraud right? 
 Like real fraud. Not the fun kind. 
 [Tinny] Well, if I do it myself I'll definitely get busted, so... 
 [Des] So what do you want? 
 What do you want, like, all b'ys? 
 Maybe you want an "a" or two? 
 [Tinny] Don't go too crazy. 
 Maybe give me like a c+ in history. 
 [Des] You know, Mal and rose won't be that upset if you've flunked out. It's understandable given the language barrier. 
 [Tinny] I didn't flunk out Des. 
 I never enrolled. 
 Long story.

 Please?

 [Leslie] Are you sure it wasn't a couple of days ago? Say, when you killed him? 
 [Marie] I didn't kill anybody!

 [Leslie] Your boyfriend, Deacon Rogers, he did yard work for your uncle? 
 [Marie] Yeah. He did. Yeah. 
 [Leslie] So where is Deacon Rogers now? 
 [Marie] I don't know. 
 We broke up. 
 [Leslie] That cigarette case, you hired the Doyle's to find, that was stolen from your uncle's and you sold it just yesterday. Correct? 
 [Jake] You can't honestly think that she killed her uncle for, like, a cigarette case? 
 [Leslie] I'm not sure. That's why I'm letting her go, so I can check out her alibi. You wouldn't happen to know where that cigarette case is, would ya? 
 [Jake] Me? No. Why would I know that? I have no idea. 
 [Leslie] Just what I thought. I wash your back, you wash your own. Same old, same old. What are you even doing here? 
 [Leslie] Cut her loose. 
 [Jake] I came to see you. 
 [Leslie] She's pretty, Jake. 
 Don't let that fool you. If she did what we think she did, she's too sick even for you.

 [Marie] I just wanna go home, Jake. Please, can I just go home and forget about this? 
 [Jake] Cigarette case has a little compartment thing in here, and I'm pretty sure this whole thing is about what was inside. Now, you wouldn't have any idea what that is, would you? 
 [Jake] Don't lie to me, Marie. 
 What was inside the case? 
 ♪ 
 [Jake] So is this what all the fuss is about? 
 [Marie] Yup.

 Anyway, they have my first name wrong. 
 Simple mistake. 
 [Mal] There you go. 
 [Tinny] It took one phone call. 
 They fixed the spelling and faxed it right on over. 
 [Rose] One phone call, huh? 
 I was calling and calling and calling... 
[Mal] - We gotta get this history mark up. Don't know your history, you're likely to repeat it. 
 [Tinny] That's true. I'm gonna get on that right now. 
 [Mal] Hey Tinny. 
 Here's a little something for the effort. 
 [Tinny] Pop, you don't have to do that. 
 [Mal] Go on with you. I found it in Jake's car anyway. Go on. 
 [Mal] She's got a brain, that one. 
 [Rose] Yeah, she's a smart on alright. 
 [Jake] So, Christian invited Marie out for a bite. Thank you so much for that. It's obvious that she's into the super slow jello head types. 
 [Mal] Jake, don't be sucky. It only makes you look worse than you are. 
 [Jake] I gotta find out what this key opens so if she comes back with Romeo, do me a favour, tell her I'm off solving her case.

 Needs that laser eye surgery? 
 That's an expensive racket.

 Heart-break. All of that.

 Where'd you find that now? 
 [Mal] Part of an investigation. 
 [Ned] Oh. Now technically I can't give you back a key that I know isn't yours. Locksmith's oath. 
 [Jake] Locksmith's oath? 
 [Ned] There's an oath. 
 Just saying. 
 [Jake] We already paid for the window, Ned. 
 [Ned] Yeah, but some new blinds would be nice.

 [Leslie] Edwin Winters from my crime scene was missing that hand when we found him.

 [Jake] Look, I know I just met the girl, but I'm pretty sure she's not going to, you know, cut her dead uncle's arm off. 
 [Leslie] The lack of blood suggests that it was severed post-mortum, so whoever did it was a sick freak. 
 [Mal] I'd say. 
 [Jake] Listen, I'm just happy to see, Leslie, that you're showing some signs of jealousy again. It's good. 
 [Leslie] Malachy, tell Jake his new girlfriend sold an item stolen from the dead man, and didn't report the body until two days after. Classic in familiar murders. Right now, she's our number one suspect. 
 [Mal] So, what's your next girlfriend going to be, a necrophiliac? 
 [Mal] Time to play a demented cinderella and see if the hand matches the body.

 [Jake] Yes, b'y. I'm always at that.
