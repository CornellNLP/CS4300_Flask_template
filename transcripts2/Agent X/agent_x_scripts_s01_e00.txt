 No scar. Not him. 
 Shhhh! Folker. Nicholas Folker, where is he? 
 Ah, I, I-I, I do not know. 
 Damn it.

 How. Are you. Still standing? 
 Oh, no. No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no. Where did Folker go? 
 Damn it. 
 
 What's your name? 
 Olga. My name is Olga. I come from the West Sibirska. They sell me to that man. 
 Did you get a good look at his face? 
 No. You do not, either? 
 No. I was... I was improvising. 
 Who are you? 
 Wait. You're lying. 
 Please. I do not understand. 
 Your perfume, Clive Christian, a little pricy for Siberian farm girls. 
 [throaty laugh] Impressive.

 Jesus!

 Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice President of the United States. 
 [fanfare and applause] 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Today, Vice President Thomas Eckhart realizes his dream of becoming President of the United States. But for many others, this day marks another dream fulfilled, the inauguration of America's first female vice president, Natalie Maccabee.  But here she is. Just moments away from taking her oath, with the eyes of the world upon her. 
 I, Natalie Kane Maccabee, do solemnly swear... 
 I, Natalie Kane Maccabee, do solemnly swear... 
 ...that I will support and defend  the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
 ...that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
 
 
 
 Natalie, congratulations. You have survived.  The first, and the most brutal test of office, eleven inaugural balls. [laughter] But listen, listen,  I am so proud,  as a former vice president myself, to present her with this, the key to this magnificent residence. 
 [applause] 
 I promise... to do my utmost, to honor its legacy. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 There's a new man in your life, Natalie.  This is Malcolm Malar. 
 Oh! 
 The Chief Steward of this residence.  You'll find him an invaluable asset during your tenure here. 
 [chuckles] 
 I look forward to serving you, Madam Vice President. 
 Oh, please, call me Nate. 
 I can assure you that will never happen, Madam Vice President. 
 Ah, you'll find Malcolm here a bit of a stickler when it comes to protocol. 
 Thank you, Mr. President. 
 Malcolm, after you. 
 Actually, the Vice President always preceeds the Chief Steward by at least a half step. 
 Oh. Okie dokie.

 [rumbling in background] 
 [hidden mechanism clicking] 
 Well done. 
 [gasps] Oh. 
 You just beat Lyndon Johnson's record at finding the lock. 
 [laugh] What exactly have I found? 
 The greatest secret in the history of our country. One step behind, ma'am. 
 Tell me this is a wine cellar. 
 I can assure you that it's not. To your right, ma'am. 
 Who, in God's name, built this? 
 Anonymous patriots. Ours is a nation born of unknown heroes. Ah. Here we are. 
 The History Room? Well, shut... the front door. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 What is this place? 
 A shrine of sorts, ma'am, devoted to protecting this document. They were on the table. 
 Thank you. Oh... this is a superb copy of the Constitution. 
 Not a copy, ma'am; the original. This is the only complete document containing Article Two, Section Five. 
 Article Two only has four sections, Malcolm. 
 Ah. 
 Section Five. "An agent of unknown identity is hereby authorized to serve at the discretion of the Vice President, for the purpose of aiding the Republic in times of dire peril." So the Vice President was some kind of crisis manager, of sorts? 
 Didn't it always seem strange to you that the Founding Fathers gave the second most important job in the executive branch virtually no duties? 
 Yeah. 
 Mmm. 
 Section Five. So, what is an agent of unknown identity? 
 "Who," ma'am, and we've always considered Nathan Hale, there, to be the first. His last words before the British hanged him for espionage have become a sort of creedo for our group. 
 I regret that I have but one li... 
 I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country. John Case at your service, Madam Vice President. 
 No kidding? 
 No kidding. 
 Madam.
