 We're here to save the Ambassador by any means necessary. 
 Three bogies have been identified.

 Ray, where the hell are you? 
 [groans] 
 [panting] 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 Never depend on people. 
 If you want to get something done, do it yourself. 
 All bogies neutralized, Malcolm. 
 We secured the Ambassador. 
 Malcolm : Copy that. Return to HQ. 
 [muffled screaming] 
 [speaking French] 
 You're welcome. 
 I said you took a long time, you idiot. 
 [puppy whimpers] 
 A present from my mistress... stupid thing would never shut up. 
 You put a shock collar on it? 
 Huh? 
 It should be on you. 
 You in some trouble, buddy? Huh? 
 Can you sit? 
 Right... there. 
 Perfect. 
 You... are so late, and you're not even dressed for the dinner party. 
 You look really good. 
 I was worried about you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know, I had a little training session with the new job. 
 Mm. 
 I brought you a puppy. 
 [gasps] 
 Oh, my God. He's so cute! Aww. 
 Where did you get him? 
 He's a rescue. 
 Oh! 
 What's his name? 
 Bogey. 
 Oh, yeah? Like Humphrey Bogart? 
 [laughs] 
 Just like Humphrey Bogart. 
 Aww. I love him. 
 So, uh, you want to eat in then? 
 Yeah. 
 What do you feel like? 
 Anything but French. 
 ♪ 
 Stanton : When Kennedy was assassinated, he was one of our most beloved presidents. 
 President Eckhart was a great man... 
 ...with an awful lot left to give his country. 
 You do not bury him yet. 
 Of course not. 
 You know the Deputy Director Zachary Brown, my Chief of Staff Loren Amari. 
 So tell me, Stanton, where are we with the investigation? 
 Stanton : It's not Dealey Plaza. 
 We're confident Agent Simmons was acting alone. 
 And what do you think, Ms. Amari? 
 Um... well... 
 I concur with the Director, of course. 
 There is no conspiracy here, ma'am. 
 We appreciate the enormous pressures you're under right now, and we will keep you apprised of any changes. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can only imagine what you must think of me. 
 I seriously doubt that. 
 Things aren't what they appear. 
 You had an affair with my husband, Loren. 
 That doesn't leave a lot of room for ambiguity. 
 There is something much bigger at work here. 
 President Eckhart... it's only the beginning. 
 What are you saying? 
 Everything okay, Madam President? 
 If you have any questions about the report, please don't hesitate to call me anytime. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [heavy metal music plays] 
 Volker : I know the drill! 
 [music stops] 
 You want to break me, try Manilow. 
 It's just a little show for Malcolm. 
 If I taught you anything, John, it's that aggressive interrogation techniques become ineffective when you're not offering the subject any incentive to talk or willing to do whatever's necessary to ensure their cooperation. 
 That's always a line you've been unwilling to cross. 
 Because I don't have to. 
 But if you fail, you got to threaten to kill me. 
 Looking forward to that. 
 Problem is, that threat only works once, and you need me alive. 
 Why? 
 To tell you who really shot the President. 
 Eckhart's still alive, isn't he? 
 Natalie : President Eckhart is on his way to a full recovery. 
 The shooter is dead and has been identified as Secret Service Agent Jason Simmons. 
 [gasps] 
 See how much you still have to learn from me, John? 
 It's just like the old days, buddy. 
 Agent Simmons was a lone wolf. 
 This is not a conspiracy. 
 So why don't you tell me what I should do? 
 You should start by threatening someone I love. 
 Oh, wait. 
 I don't love anybody. 
 You, on the other hand, do love somebody, don't you? 
 The blonde... what's her name? 
 Pamela. 
 If I can get to Eckhart, I can definitely get to her. 
 From that chair? 
 Good luck. 
 This nation owes a debt of gratitude to Agent Kevin Rawls for his heroic actions. 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 Agent Rawls. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Woman : Agent Rawls! 
 There's a flaw in your logic, buddy. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, you do love someone. 
 You love yourself and that sick, twisted mind of yours. 
 And Malcolm is gonna waltz down here, and he's gonna take it all away from you. 
 How's that? 
 Scopolamine 5. 
 Malcolm : John, you're needed in Ops. 
 Go, John. Follow orders. 
 The Vice President is waiting for her lapdog. 
 ♪ 
 Agent X, reporting as ordered. 
 Hello, John. 
 If you want Volker to talk, there is really only one option. 
 Scopolamine 5. 
 It is a very volatile hallucinogenic, but it has proven very effective in CIA interrogations. 
 It has also proven very effective in rendering its subject permanently brain damaged. 
 I'm inclined to agree with John on this. 
 Malcolm : All due respect, sir, but we cannot afford to sit around and hope that he talks. 
 Volker is much too dangerous for that. 
 The serum is our best and most viable option. 
 There's 50-50 chance Volker dies. 
 [sarcastically] And what a loss that would be. 
 Miles : They're going to use scopolamine on you. 
 I need to get you out of here. 
 No. 
 Better if I stay. 
 Your fatality designs are unraveling. 
 Not unraveling... evolving. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 [machine beeping] 
 ♪ 
 Malcolm : What is your name? 
 Volker : Raymond. 
 Raymond Marks. 
 You also use an alias. 
 Nicholas Volker. 
 Who is involved in the conspiracy to take over the government of the United States? 
 CIA Director Gray Lawson. 
 We know about Lawson. Who else? 
 Simmons. 
 Secret Service Agent Jason Simmons. 
 What is your plan? 
 What do you and your co-conspirators hope to gain? 
 [monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Geryon. 
 [groans] 
 We're losing him. 
 Who else works for you? 
 Volker : [groans] 
 Geryon! 
 Want it! [grunts] 
 Got to get the Geryon for me. 
 Who is your operative? 
 Geryon! 
 Geryon! 
 Geryon was one of the mythical beasts in Dante's "Divine Comedy". 
 Dante reached the last circle of Hell by riding a winged creature who was part-human and part-beast. 
 I appreciate the English lit tutorial, but where are you going with this? 
 He's talking about Dante Kane. 
 He's an eccentric and reclusive tech billionaire and aerospace engineer who builds satellites for the U.S. military. 
 He's also a traitor. 
 Dante illegally embedded spyware in his software which allows him to manipulate or destroy satellites in orbit using a mobile control unit which he created. 
 Guess what he called it? 
 Geryon. 
 A device like that in Volker's hands would be absolutely catastrophic. 
 He could not only crash power grids, he could access encrypted banking transactions and take down telecommunications worldwide. 
 I'm in classified briefings on the Hill every day. 
 How come I've never heard about this device? 
 [clears throat] 
 Okay, I get it. 
 I'm the new kid on the Agent X block. 
 Five days ago, I never knew this program existed. 
 Now I'm running it. 
 Dante has planted himself on a private island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 
 This weekend, he will hold his annual "Dante's Inferno" gala where he opens up the island to guests from all around the world. 
 We need to get to the island and find and secure that device before Volker's agent gets to it. 
 Is this the part where I'm supposed to give you orders to engage? 
 You just did. 
 Yeah. 
 This is the part. 
 Nailed it. 
 Malcolm : Dante's island is located in the most remote portion of the Pacific Ocean... 
 Point Nemo. 
 2,688 kilometers from the nearest point of land. 
 A nice little spot to get away from it all. 
 The invitation list is eclectic and exclusive. 
 Nevertheless, we have arranged through Dante's publicist to add a representative from the library of congress to the guest list. 
 Each guest will be required to wear a security bracelet. 
 This will allow you access to the premises, your guest suite, and all public areas during the weekend. 
 Does that bracelet get me into Dante's secure room where he keeps the Geryon? 
 Afraid not. 
 For that, you will have to acquire Dante Kane's personal security bracelet. 
 Okay. 
 Listen, John, uh... you and I have been through a hell of a lot lately. 
 Keep your head in the game, stay focused... 
 ...and Godspeed.

 Hello again, Just John. 
 I see you hopped back in bed with your enemy. 
 Mm. 
 We reconciled our differences. 
 Why don't you and I reconcile ours? 
 Do my back. 
 Please? 
 You're here for the Geryon. 
 We do seem to share a mutual interest. 
 Although it won't be easy. 
 Ju-ju Yang... former Chinese intelligence and now Dante's personal bodyguard. 
 Uwe Heinwick. 
 Also on the Dante Kane payroll. 
 I thought that crazy b*st*rd was dead. 
 You think too much. 
 Why not just enjoy yourself? 
 I'm here to work, Olga. 
 Too much work and no play makes John a dull boy, yes? 
 I can think of a lot of ways for us to play. 
 And I promise none of them are dull. 
 John? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Hi. 
 Uh, I would ask the same thing of you. 
 I was personally invited by Mr. Kane. 
 This must be the girl you told me absolutely nothing about, John. 
 Pamela Richardson. 
 And you are? 
 Olga. 
 Olga...? 
 Oh. Just Olga. 
 Olga and I are very... 
 John and I did a lot of traveling together. 
 We had some very special times, didn't we, John? 
 Mm. 
 [applause] 
 Dante : Olga. 
 Dante's been looking for you. 
 Hello, my prince of darkness. 
 [speaking Russian] 
 Mm. 
 Mm. 
 Aww. It's true love. 
 [laughs] 
 [giggles] 
 Ahh, yes. 
 Your turn. 
 Pamela Richardson... beloved protégé of David Williams. 
 I'm not a protégé any longer. 
 Mm. 
 Of course. You're a brilliant attorney. 
 My condolences over your boss' sudden passing. 
 Thank you, Mr. Kane. 
 I never liked that guy. 
 It was a mistake to work with David all those years. 
 I should have been working more closely with you instead. 
 And please, call me Dante. 
 Dante. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Have you met John yet, Dante? 
 We have not been formally introduced, no. 
 We haven't. Uh, should I care? 
 I'm a representative of the Library of Congress. 
 As a librarian, you must not get out much. 
 Eh, you'd be surprised. 
 Dante does love surprises. 
 By the way, it's nice to meet you. 
 Great party. 
 I am in need of new in-house counsel. 
 It's a job I think you would be ideally suited for and I would love to discuss with you later. 
 I'm flattered, but... 
 Shh, don't speak. 
 Think. 
 Dante doesn't expect an answer now. 
 It's something that we can talk about later in private. 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 And now it's time for everyone to prepare for a bacchanalian celebration worthy of eternal damnation. 
 Quite the showman. 
 Yeah. 
 You will find costumes for this evening's masquerade ball waiting for you in your guest rooms. 
 Dante will see you all in Hell this evening. 
 Namaste. 
 Wow. 
 I love it when people talk about themselves in third person. 
 I like when people talk about themselves. 
 No secrets. 
 ♪ 
 "Help." Loren Amari gave me this. 
 That girl knows something. 
 And I suspect Volker's not done. 
 I want you to send John to see her. 
 He isn't available, and even if he were... 
 Well, where is he? 
 I'm not at liberty to disclose that ma'am, and you and I should not be having this conversation. 
 Damn it, Malcolm, you do something or I will. 
 I implore you not to do anything rash, Madam President. 
 Well, that's up to you. 
 Fortunately, official procedure does not define the role of the Chief Steward in such matters, and I have the night off. 
 This must never happen again.

 "Midway upon the journey of our life, I found myself within a forest dark, for the straight forward pathway had been lost." 
 "The Divine Comedy." 
 Money, success, fame, I had all these, but Dante needed more. 
 So I sought out education and amusement in all disciplines and I host annual events to celebrate achievements and skill.

 Today, you will have first-row seats to a competition of a lifetime.

 Ah, Ms. Richardson, just in time. 
 Watch this. 
 "Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant." 
 "Hail Caesar. 
 Those who are about to die salute you." 
 A salutation given by gladiators before they're about to fight to the death. 
 A woman after my own heart. 
 Excuse me. 
 So are you an angel or a demon? 
 What do you think? 
 Dante has selected two opponents to fight... 
 One of which is my own formidable Chief of Security. 
 [bracelet beeps] 
 And let the fight begin. 
 [grunting] 
 How are you? 
 It's a been long time since someone's actually asked me that. 
 How are you? 
 The same. 
 Why are you really on this island? 
 Hate to miss a great party. 
 I'm not asking as your ex-girlfriend. 
 I'm asking as Dante's attorney. 
 Well, then, I plead the fifth. 
 What are you looking for? 
 Dante has something Olga came to steal. 
 [cheers and applause] 
 And you're trying to steal it first? 
 Come here. 
 I need you to help me, Pamela. 
 Help you? 
 Look, if you want me to help you, you're gonna have to tell me the truth this time. 
 Contrary to what you may think, I have never lied to you. 
 [laughs] 
 I may not have always told you the truth, but I've never lied. 
 That's a pretty fine line. 
 All right, you know when I was kid I lost my dad, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I take this new job and for the first time in my life, I've got... a father figure... and an older brother, and they both betrayed me. 
 And I'm in that place where I don't even know what to believe anymore. 
 I don't know what I've been doing, and then you show up. 
 And you show up, like you walked out of a dream. 
 Sorry. 
 Oh, don't be sorry. 
 [chuckles] 
 But listen, I'm gonna do this mission and I'm out. I'm done. 
 Really? 
 So you're saying you're gonna... quit whatever it is that you really do. 
 I am. I mean that. 
 That is the truth. 
 [sighs] Okay. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Here's something you should know. 
 The man from the Library of Congress is not who he appears to be. 
 He's a corporate spy. 
 The librarian? 
 He seems harmless. 
 Are you sure? 
 Are you sure you don't have anything he might be interested in stealing? 
 Oh, honey, if that  were  true, no one could ever get to it. 
 Looks like he might be stealing something from you right now. 
 Dante. Do you have a moment? 
 For you, always. 
 I've been thinking about your offer. 
 We should talk. 
 In private. 
 No better time than the present.

 Small change in the fight program. 
 Dante : Ladies and gentlemen, the next fighters have been chosen.

 Bookworm, let's see what you're really made of. 
 I think there's been a mistake, Dante.

 What's up, guys? 
 [crowd cheers] 
 Ahh.

 I'm so glad you were willing to consider my offer, especially since you haven't seen the signing bonus yet. 
 Music. 
 [ funk music plays ] 
 Oh. 
 This isn't solely about business. 
 This is about you. 
 I know you've been going through a tough time lately, and I wanted you to know that I can protect you. 
 It's hard to take anything you say seriously. 
 [scoffs] I'm a showman. 
 [laughs] 
 Dante's just one of the many characters I play. 
 I need someone real in my life, someone I can trust. 
 You can trust me. 
 Anything your heart desires, I can give you. 
 Just say yes... and I will make your dreams come true. 
 It is a dangerous world, and you are trafficking with dangerous people. 
 If they can get to David Williams and your late fiancé, surely they can get to you. 
 No one wants to hurt me anymore. 
 Don't be naive, Pamela. 
 A woman in your position can have a lot of enemies. 
 Let me be your friend. 
 Come work for me full-time as my in-house counsel. 
 I'll think about it. 
 [glasses clink] 
 You do that. 
 Just know that a man in my position is used to getting what he wants. 
 Hmm.

 The President is waiting for you, Mr. Speaker. 
 Natalie : There's so few people I can trust right now. 
 I hope you're one of them. 
 Miles : Of course, Natalie. You know that. 
 It's just that I have to figure out how to run this country while there's a cabal out there trying to destroy it. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 You tell me. 
 How's John? 
 I don't know any John. 
 But if I did, I'm sure he'd be doing everything he can to help. 
 [muffled groaning] 
 [muffled groaning] 
 Who do I have to thank for this? 
 Olga, and she took Dante's security bracelet. 
 That means she can get anywhere on the island now. 
 Did you bring your company plane? 
 Yes, do you need it? 
 No. 
 I need you to get on it and get off this island. 
 When will I see you again? 
 I don't know. 
 Alert the secur... 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 [muffled groaning] 
 Shut up. 
 Woman :  Please repeat, Dante. 
 I did not understand. Dante's home is programmed to respond only to his voice. I think he was alerting security. Can that system locate your bracelet? Don't make John punch Dante in the face. [muffled] I won't. I want to see this. [muffled groaning] You're gonna say exactly what I need you to say. Dante :  Locate my security bracelet. Woman :  Yes, Dante. Your security bracelet is 50 meters ahead. [alarm sounds] [grunts] Olga : Great. That was smart. The bracelet has been deactivated. Dante :  You should know by now everything on Dante's island is a game, and you just lost. It's a recording. Like Geryon of ancient myth whose innocent face disguised its scorpion-like deadly tail, you also have been stung and delivered to the eighth circle of Hell... punishing those who would commit violence, deceit, and fraud, and attempt to steal something that does not belong to you. [air hissing] Gas? No. The air's being sucked out of the room. Dante's gonna suffocate us. ♪ [air hissing] You know what I don't understand? Why the hell are you working for Volker again when he just tried to kill you? I'm not working for Volker. I'm working with my old friends at the Russian FSB. [sighs] They said they could protect me from him. Yeah, well, I don't believe you. We're both running out of air. Why would I waste my breath on a lie? If you're not working for Volker, then who's his operative on the island? Does it matter? We're locked in here and about to die. None of it matters anymore. [glass shatters] [woman gasping, gagging] [coughs] [squeals] [gasps] There we go. Now just breathe. Just breathe. [gasps, groans] Olga : I never thought I'd die like this. You figured it'd be with a bullet in your back? No, not that. I always thought I'd die alone. My parents died when I was 12. I wandered the streets of Novosibirsk starving, alone, until this man Vladimir found me, fed me, took care of me, and I was his... until I killed him. I learned then that killing wasn't that hard. I liked it. I was good at it. I never told that story to anyone until now, Just John. It's Case. What? My name is John Case. [chuckles] Is that your real name? No. But it is who I am. ♪ [indistinct conversations] Dante : [muffled groaning] What happened? What'd you do? Programmed the Geryon to transmit a signal that will knock out the power for 100 mile radius around the island. Why didn't you think of this sooner? I wanted to hear the rest of your story. [sighs] You're kidding. Let's get the hell out of Hell. With the power cut off, it should revert back to manual. Loren, I need to know what's going on. Why would anyone want to kill you? I found out about the conspiracy against the government. I... I went to Natalie's husband, Stephen, at the Justice Department. Because you knew you could trust him. Yes. Back then I was... dating this man that later became my fiancé. Miles Latham. John : [grunts] Russian bitch. Give us the device. I'll take Ju-ju. I thought you might say that. [all grunting] John, do you copy? It's not a good time, Malcolm. You need to abort your mission now. Why? One of Volker's co-conspirators is Miles Latham. This was all a set-up. Malcolm, I know who Volker's operative on the island is. Who? [groans] Me. I'm Volker's operative. [grunting] [panting] They know I'm a part of the cabal. Natalie's back in control of X. I need to get you out of here now. Pamela : Need a lift? I thought I told you to leave. I never do what I'm told. [muffled groaning] What happened to Olga? Olga went back to Russia... ...with love. [helicopter blades whirring] Let's get the hell out of Hell. Did you get what you came for? I had an old friend tell me that you should never depend on other people. They were wrong. I knew I could count on you. Did you mean what you said earlier, or were you just trying to get me to help you? I guess you meant it. [engine revs] [monitor beeping] [static] Miles? Malcolm?
