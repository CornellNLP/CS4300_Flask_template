 Malcolm. 
 Malcolm : The Vice President is waiting. 
 All right. 
 [telephone beeps] 
 Three hours ago, there was an event on the Russian/Chechen border involving a joint Russian/U.S. nuclear inspection team. 
 They drove straight into a Chechen rebel ambush. 
 [yelling in Russian] 
 [goats bleating] 
 [screaming] 
 Nine short-range nuclear missiles are now in the hands of terrorists. 
 The missiles are disarmed, right? 
 Not for long. They took a hostage to reassemble them. 
 Dr. Eugene Bullock... the D.o.D.'s top expert in atomic weapons. 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Any clue who the warlord is behind all this? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Malik Ahmad. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Please! 
 First we asked for freedom, and we were oppressed. 
 Then we begged for it. 
 We were imprisoned. 
 And then we fought for it. 
 And we were killed. 
 Now... our enemies will die. 
 Ahmad uploaded this as a recruitment video half an hour ago. 
 [ gunshots ] 
 So you knew this butcher from your days in Special Forces? 
 He was in Afghanistan in '03 fighting with the Taliban. 
 That is, till they kicked him out for being too extremist. 
 He slaughtered an entire village because they allowed my platoon to dig them a well. 
 [ gunshots ] 
 [ indistinct shouting ] 
 So how do we catch this guy? 
 This guy's a monster. 
 You don't catch him... you kill him. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 So you really think Olga's gonna play ball, maybe get us some actionable intel? 
 Nicolas Volker sends her a bomb as a break-up gift. 
 Yeah, I think she'll play ball. 
 Woman on P.A. :  Dr. Gadaski to Cardiology, stat. 
 Dr. Gadaski to Cardiology, stat. Mmm! Jesus Christ. Guys. Don't blame them. The bomb gave me a concussion, and the concussion gave me a fever. I was told you had something to offer me. Hmm? Clearly, I was wrong. Nine missiles. I know where Malik Ahmad is holding Dr. Bullock. As well as all those nasty little missiles. ♪ ♪ And by tomorrow, it will be too late to ever get them back. So how in God's name does Olga know where Bullock and the missiles are? Evidently, Ahmad's one of her former clients. He used her intel to plan the ambush. What else you got? Olga refuses to talk to anyone other than the unknown operative that captured her. She was adamant. I thought it wise not to reveal the fact that we haven't identified him yet. And when will that be? I don't know. We're still working on it. But my gut tells me that this unknown operative is one of ours. Ours? His wet work dovetails almost exactly with the CIA's playbook. Gray : I've already checked. He's an orphan. Contrary to Edwin's chatter intercept at the FBI water cooler, the CIA is not behind every global conspiracy. Just the ones that go sideways. [chuckles] Edwin, I know you have your issues with managing stress, so I'm gonna disregard that remark. Eckhart : Okay, great. What about Ahmad? Marine FORCON is already infiltrating the Eastern caucuses. Right, and what are the odds of finding him in that godforsaken wasteland? Slim and none, sir. ♪ ♪ If Olga wants to tell me where the missiles are, let me talk to her. Malcolm : It's a trap. Two days ago, she almost killed John. Why should we trust her today? Well, you can trust she's trying to save her own skin. [sighs] Volker's put a pretty big bull's-eye on her forehead. Natalie : That's presuming you can even make contact with her. I mean, the woman has 24-hour guards on her own hospital floor. Not to mention the potential for collateral damage. We'll go with non-lethals... bean-bag guns, tasers. Well, then you're taking all the risk. That's my job. ♪ ♪ Malcolm : John? I broke protocol back there, sorry. No, no, this isn't about me or my pride, it's about Ahmad. Olga gets me anywhere near that son of a bitch, I'm gonna take him out. No, you will not, John. Not if it gets in the way of rescuing Bullock and destroying those missiles. That  is your mission, not killing Ahmad. Reporter :  Sources from the Pentagon say that there's no danger that the hijackers can activate the nuclear arms and express confidence that things will be moved quickly... [chuckles]  Skazki. ...along with Dr. Eugene bullock. What? Fairy tales. Woman on P.A. :  Pain Management to three west, Pain Management to three west. Okay, I'm in play. Copy that. Shutting down hospital video surveillance. You're good to go. [siren wails in distance] Checking weather in the D.C. area... [knock on door] Man : Open up, we're moving Petrovka. ...high in the 70s. Winds are gonna be coming out of the Southwest... [elevator bell dings] Good morning. ♪ ♪ Ah! ♪ ♪ [elevator bell dings] ♪ ♪ [gasping] Volker sends his love. [grunts] [screams] [sighs] I was afraid you didn't get my message. You're late. You're ungrateful. What's this? [collar beeps] A titanium tracking collar. That's a stupid way to begin a negotiation. If you double cross me, Olga, then I'll release your location on the Dark Web. I'm sure your old boyfriend would be thrilled to know where you are. I would have preferred a bracelet. You'd have just chewed off your hand. Oh, I'll take that as a compliment. Come on. Down the hall to the right. Why me, Olga? Why not the FBI? I want my freedom, and the government can't protect me. [door thuds] In order to vanish, I need the help of the second-best specialist I know. Second-best, huh? You think you're better than me? No. But Nicolas is. ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no! sh1t. ♪ ♪ We need security now! Level two, O.R. five! ♪ ♪ Shotgun? It's a bean-bag gun. Seriously? It's a long story. Right. Left. [alarm blaring] Hands up, nobody move! Man on P.A. :  Attention all visitors and hospital staff, we're in lockdown. Remain calm. Security Situation Red. Security Situation Red.

Left! Malcolm, we need a new exit. Second floor, northeast corner. Copy that. Northeast side, corner window. [tires screech] Hey, stop right there! Come on, come on! Visitors and hospital staff, we're in lockdown. Remain calm. Security Situation Red. Olga : We're trapped. Not yet. Come on! [tires squeal] You've got nowhere to go! Hurry! That's gonna hurt. [alarm blaring] That was incredible. Malcolm, meet Olga. You interrupted my lunch. [tires squeal] [siren wails] [police radio chatter, alarm blaring] Where did he go? Come on. Olga wants a new identity and $20 million in a Swiss bank account. And for that, she  will  tell us where Ahmad's headquarters is. Tell us, no. But she will take John there. Okay, where are they? [computer beeping] Malcolm : Right there. Olga : Once we land, we take the overnight train to the Chechen border. An old friend will meet us there. Really? And who's this old friend of yours? I'll make you a deal. I'll tell you who he is... if you tell me who... you are. I'm shy. Oh, come on. At least your name. What do I call you? John. John who? Just John. Fine. Just John. Man :  All units, all units, we have all entrances and exits to the hospital sealed at this time. What a screw up. Our one shot at recovering those missiles flies out a goddamn window. I want to see surveillance footage now. Unfortunately, all cameras were turned off during the attack. Who does that remind you of? Our unknown operative. [cellphone ringing] Yeah? Man : Sir, we may have something. This better not be a fishing trip. Okay. So 3:10 A.M., 10 minutes after your daughter was rescued, this was taken near the construction site. Stanton : Congratulations, Jerold. You just caught a minor traffic infraction. No, our man is here, he's just hidden. Here, I'll blow it up. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ What? Yes. I'm definitely starting to figure out who you are, Just John. Yeah? Why don't you remind me? I forget sometimes. Judging by your accent, you come from the Midwest somewhere. Some depressed little farming community. Tell me I'm wrong. You're not wrong. You're just stating the obvious. How is this, then? You weren't born a killer. You were made one. Oh, and you put on a good front. But sometimes, you give yourself away. Do you want to know how? [chuckles] I want to go to bed. [clears throat] You're right. We should sleep. ♪ ♪ [sighs] You do know the bottom of our seats fold out to form one big bed. ♪ ♪ We'll have more room to lie down. I like to rest like this... upright and eyes open. Afraid I'm gonna cut your throat? Pretty much. [sighs] Then you don't understand me as well as I understand you. ♪ ♪ Your eyes are soft sometimes. That's how I know you weren't born a killer. ♪ ♪ [door opens] Missy : Hey. I got your text. What's the emergency? Have a seat, we need to talk. You were a very stubborn kid, you know that? Your mom wanted to put you in time-out all the time. I said no. You know why? Unh-unh. I saw character in you. I saw strength. I did not want to break that. I'm confused, here, Dad. Is there some kind of problem? The problem is I am a cop, and you are a potential accessory to a crime. ♪ ♪ Come here. Let me show you something. ♪ ♪ [computer beeps] These were my men. Friends. Dad, ugh! This unknown operative, the man you say rescued you from Olga Petrovka, is my only lead. Now, I know damn well you lied to me, Missy. I know you got a good look at him. Dad, I owe him my life. I promised I... You are not being loyal to him right now, you are being a traitor to your country! These men died for us. Their families will never see them again. I understand. I... [sighs] Do whatever you want. [sighs] It would have been nice if I stole a cab with a heater. You think this is cold? This is nothing. In Novosibirsk, my father would take me hunting in this weather. Are you kidding? How old were you? Oh, 10, 11, maybe. What did you guys hunt for? Everything. Birds, deer, rabbits. The first thing I killed was a fox. She was beautiful. So white, she almost melted in the snow. We saw the steam coming from her wound. I thought her soul was rising to the sky. Papa was so proud. You see, there was a time when I had soft eyes, too. [vehicle approaches] Here's the man who can get us to Ahmad. ♪ ♪ Olga. I'm so glad the rumors of your death were wrong. Yes, well, if you're not making enemies, you're not making money. [chuckles] Mwah! [bird caws] Did you bring the dress? Of course. And everything else you requested. ♪ ♪ I thought you'd be alone. Who's this? I've been slowly figuring that out. [grunts] [chuckles] That's a funny joke. [laughs] You could have gotten us killed. It was worth it for the look on your face. How did you know I even spoke Russian? On the train, you grabbed the sugar packets for your tea instead of the salt. Come on. You drive while I dress, okay? Fox story, my ass. Ah! [speaks Russian] [engine turns over] ♪ ♪ Ma'am, I just intercepted this from an internal FBI communique. Is that John? Yes. [sighs] And if they enhance the photo? Then John is burned. Can we stop them? There's a piece of malware that might work, but it's got to be delivered on site. John : That guy back there was Niko Kraxos, the arms dealer? [grunts] Yes. We're old friends. And you burned him just like that? [sighs] I had no choice. We need this car, yes? The license plate is our invitation. Invitation to what? An auction. Ahmad is selling some of the missiles he captured. And arms dealers from around the world are flying in to bid. How do you know all this? [sighs] I buy and sell intelligence. It's my business to know. Hmm. Ah.  Prekrasna! 
 
 ♪ ♪ [chatter] Stanton : That's it? That's the best you can do? Uh, well, there's one other option. The CIA has a more powerful version of facial-enhancement software. They call it Persona. The CIA. CIA. [cork pops] Aah! [giggles] [sighs] Mmm! I love Champagne in the morning. Hmm? I'll celebrate after the mission, when we get those missiles back. That is just stupid. After the mission, you may be dead. To be alive another day in our business, that's enough to celebrate. [chuckles] Wow. You must have been really fun in high school. Dooley : Okay, kids, please stay together. Our next stop is the FBI Forensic Lab. My dad says that the FBI is outdated. Mm, next time, bring your dad. We'd  love  to meet him. Have you shot anybody?

Uh, uh, I'm sorry, what is... what is this? Have you shared your password with anyone? [chuckles] No, why would I do that? You can cut the belligerent attitude, Jerold. I'm trying to help you. Help me? Someone has used your password to hack into our mainframe. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Has anything been compromised? Well, now, you jumped to that conclusion mighty quickly, didn't you, Jerold? Well, I... I'm sorry, I'm just scared. I swear to God, I don't know anything about this breach. Mm-hmm. Plug this in, we'll see. What is that?

Then I will walk it in to the President. Stanton : No, no, no. I  walk it in to the President. My intel. My software. Okay, fine, we'll walk it in together. But if this leads to getting the missiles back, the press release will call it a joint FBI/CIA operation. Agreed. Have your people send it over immediately. [computer beeping] Uh-oh. It says my file is initializing an encrypted export. All right, now look, you can't let them send that file until my software is downloaded. I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. There's what? Well, I could... ♪ ♪ Dooley : Benjamin Peterson? Peterson, Mr. Benjamin Peterson? Hello. Man : The Vice President. Where's my camera?! Hi, how's everybody doing? So sorry to interrupt. Tick tock, tick tock, Jerold. Okay, yeah, I know, I know, I know. This has never happened before. Yes? My dad says the Vice President doesn't to anything. Like a mascot. Really?!

And you went on to slaughter an entire village. Trust me, Ahmad, I've had no problem pulling the trigger since then. So now you have a decision to make. You can slay the monster, or you can set it free to help you slay a bigger monster. Killing you is not my mission... today. [gunshot] We need guns, yeah? Yeah. Follow me.
