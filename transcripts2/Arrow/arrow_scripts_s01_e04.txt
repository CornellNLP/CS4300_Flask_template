 My name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal-- survive. 
 Oliver Queen is alive. 
 Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish... 
 You can survive this. 
 To use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 
 Previously on "Arrow"... 
 How am I supposed to stay away from you if you won't stay away from me? 
 John Diggle. He'll be accompanying you from now on. 
 I think I'm just beginning to understand the kind of man you are. 
 [Groans] 
 [Groans] 
 [Coughs] 
 Hey. 
 Oliver? 
 You're that vigilante. 
 Easy, Dig. 
 You were poisoned. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Oliver : Come on. 
 Come on. 
 I could have taken you anywhere, could have taken you home. 
 I brought you here. 
 You really did lose your mind on that island. 
 Found a couple things along the way. 
 Like what, archery classes? 
 Clarity. 
 Starling City is dying. 
 It is being poisoned by a criminal elite who don't care who they hurt, as long as they maintain their wealth and power. 
 What are you gonna do, take 'em all down by your lonesome? 
 No. 
 Now, I want you to join me. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Special Forces out of Kandahar. 
 It's perfect. 
 You're a fellow soldier. 
 Oliver, you're not a soldier. 
 You're a criminal. 
 And a murderer.

 [Door opens] 
 Where were you? 
 What? 
 [Sighs] 
 What are you doing here? 
 I heard about the shooting, and I wanted to make sure you were ok. 
 You did? 
 Yeah. 
 I knocked on the door, and I found a family terrified for you. 
 They had no idea where you were. 
 Oh. 
 Oliver, are you so self-centered that you don't think that people who care about you are gonna wonder where you are after you all got shot at? 
 You're right. 
 I made peace with your selfishness a long time ago, but Moira, Thea, and Walter, they don't deserve that. 
 They deserve better, someone who doesn't care only about himself. 
 Laurel... thank you for coming. 
 I care about the lives of other people, Oliver. 
 Maybe you should try it sometime. 
 Oh, man. 
 [Sighs] 
 That was harsh. 
 You ok? 
 Sure. 
 Second time tonight that a friend of mine has taken me to the woodshed. 
 Kind of tires you out. 
 Yeah. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 [Bird chirping] 
 Shengcún. 
 What am I supposed to do with that? 
 Shengcún. 
 Does that mean "bird"? 
 Shengcún! 
 I don't speak Chinese! 
 I'm sorry, Laurel. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [Wind blowing] 
 Reporter : There were no signs of forced entry or any evidence of a struggle, but, hours later, the police found that the bloodstained kitchen knife in the trunk... 
 Couldn't sleep, either? 
 No. 
 Forensic analysis verified... 
 What are you watching? 
 Peter Declan. 
 Blood on the blade... 
 Hmm? 
 Peter Declan's fingerprints... 
 A guy who killed his wife. 
 Despite the growing list of evidence... 
 Right. This guy killed his wife in their baby's room. 
 Psycho. 
 Camille was everything to me. 
 I couldn't kill her any more than I could kill myself. 
 So why can't you sleep? 
 Bad dreams. 
 About? 
 Laurel. 
 So why don't you make a play? 
 I mean, she did come over here just to make sure you didn't get shot. 
 There are reasons. 
 Mm, what are they? 
 Besides you sleeping with her sister and her sister dying and her father hating your guts and you basically being a jerk to everybody since you've been back? 
 Those are the top ones. 
 I know that it might not seem like it sometimes, but... 
 I'm not the same person I used to be. 
 So show her. 
 Be yourself. 
 I mean your new self. 
 How did you sleep? 
 Just fine. 
 Thank you. 
 We have a visitor. 
 Hmm. Mr. Diggle's replacement. 
 Replacement? 
 Yes. He tendered his resignation this morning. 
 Did he say why? 
 He said he didn't approve of the way you spend your evenings, particularly given that they always begin with you ditching him. 
 Hi. 
 Mr. Queen, Rob Scott. 
 I'll be your new body man. 
 That's a firm grip you got there, Rob. 
 That's 5 years SWAT with Monument Point M.C.U. 
 I feel safer already. 
 Ah, thank God we don't have to hear about this awful man anymore. 
 Declan's execution is set for midnight 2 days from now. 
 Camille Declan's former employer, Jason Brodeur, released a statement saying, quote, "I hope this gives Camille the peace she deserves." 
 Jason Brodeur? 
 What? 
 The dead wife worked for Jason Brodeur. 
 Apparently so. What-- why? 
 No reason. 
 Say, Rob, I want to go into town. 
 Could you please get the car for me? 
 No offense, Mr. Queen, but I have been filled in on your tendency to slip the leash. 
 If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer keeping you in my sights at all times. 
 We're 20 miles from the city. 
 If you don't drive me, how else am I gonna get there? 
 Right? 
 I like him. 
 Hey! 
 Oliver : They say Peter Declan murdered his wife in cold blood. 
 He had no alibi, and all the evidence pointed toward him. 
 He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, an open-and-shut case, except for one thing. 
 Declan's wife Camille worked for Jason Brodeur. 
 And Jason Brodeur is on the list. 
 Mr. Brodeur. 
 Admiring your handiwork? 
 You should have just let me kill both of 'em. 
 Peter Declan is worth more alive. 
 "Husband kills wife" is a much better headline than "whistle-blower uncovers toxic dumping," don't you think? 
 Either way, 48 hours, all this'll be over. 
 Oliver : The odds are good that Brodeur is involved in this woman's murder, which means an innocent man is facing execution. 
 He'll need a good attorney. 
 So I take it there's absolutely no point in asking if you'd like to grab a drink? 
 I can't. I have to go over transcripts for the Fernands case. 
 You know, if you go somewhere that's not work or your home, your odds of meeting someone increase by, like, a gazillion percent. 
 Oh, that's not true. 
 I could still get mugged on the way home. 
 In that case, I hope he's cute and single. 
 Good night, Joanna. 
 [Wind blowing] 
 Hello, Laurel. 
 Don't move! 
 I'm not gonna hurt you. 
 Stay back. 
 My father's a cop. 
 You are making a huge mistake. 
 I'm not the person you think I am, and I need your help. 
 Peter Declan is gonna be executed in 48 hours. 
 I think he's innocent. 
 Declan's wife was gonna blow the whistle on Jason Brodeur. 
 Brodeur had her murdered. 
 There are a thousand lawyers in Starling City. 
 Why me? 
 We're both trying to help. 
 What makes you sure I'm gonna help you? 
 Because I know you'd do anything to save the life of an innocent man. 
 [Cell door clangs] 
 A jury has charged you as guilty, Mr. Declan. 
 The evidence was stacked against me, but I didn't kill my wife. 
 I didn't take my daughter's mother from her. 
 The murder weapon was a knife from your kitchen with your prints on it. 
 It was found, along with Camille's blood, in the trunk of your car. 
 Your neighbors said they heard an argument that night. 
 We had a knockdown fight over Jason Brodeur. 
 Camille worked for him, and his company had been dumping toxic waste into the Glades. 
 Now, Camille told me that she'd gone and told a supervisor about it. 
 I was afraid for my family's safety. 
 And we argued very loudly, yes. 
 Izzy started crying, so Camille went and stayed in her room. 
 In the morning, I went to apologize, and that's when I found her. 
 So I just grabbed Izzy, and I ran outside, and I called 911. 
 I'm innocent, Ms. Lance. 
 Well, it looks like someone forgot a lunch date with his wife. 
 What do you mean? 
 Lunch isn't for another-- 
 45 minutes ago. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's all right. The restaurant is holding our table. 
 Is there something wrong? 
 Compliance department has tagged something, $2.6 million withdrawal from one of our Vancouver subsidiaries. 
 What--you mean-- are you saying that someone embezzled $2.6 million from the company? 
 Well, it's probably a bookkeeping error, but compliance is understandably worried about an IRS audit. 
 Hmm. 
 But don't worry. 
 I'm sure it's nothing. 
 Come on. 
 We're gonna be late. 
 [Radio] 
 On our way. 
 Well, I wasn't the lead on this, but from what I recall, we had fingerprints. 
 We had blood. 
 We got motive, everything. 
 Brodeur seems like the type of guy with resources needed to frame someone. 
 Laurel, in 24 hours, Peter Declan is lying down with a needle in his arm, and he's not getting up. 
 If I thought for a second we didn't have the right guy, do you think there's anything else I'd be doing right now except trying to get at what really happened? 
 Declan said his wife went to her supervisor with allegations that Brodeur was dumping toxic waste. 
 Yeah, but that supervisor, he said that never happened. 
 Let me see. 
 What was his name? 
 Here you go. 
 Istook, Matt Istook. 
 He said he didn't even see Camille that day. 
 Happy now? 
 Yes. 
 You know, I thought it'd be a cold day in hell before you started defending criminals. 
 I'm not so sure Declan's a criminal. 
 Like you said, he's on a clock. 
 Can't leave any stone unturned. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 So when are you gonna tell me? 
 Hmm? 
 About what happened to your arm. 
 Oh, it's my shoulder, and it's--it's fine. 
 I knew that Queen guy was trouble. 
 Hey, I never said this happened protecting Queen. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Then what's he doing here? 
 Area is secure, sir. 
 Thank you very much, Rob. 
 Hello, Diggle's sister-in-law Carly. 
 I'm Oliver Queen. 
 I know who you are. 
 No, you really don't. 
 Hello. 
 I couldn't help but notice a distinct lack of police cars when I got home. 
 I knew you wouldn't drop a dime on me. 
 So have you considered my offer? 
 Offer. [Scoffs] 
 That's one hell of a way to put it. 
 It is an offer. 
 It's a chance to do the kind of good that compelled you to join the military. 
 Please. 
 You were born with a platinum spoon in your mouth, Queen. 
 What, you spent 5 years on an island with no room service, and suddenly you found religion? [Scoffs] 
 This was my father's. 
 I found it when I buried him. 
 I thought you said your father died when the boat went down. 
 We both made it to a life raft, but there wasn't enough food and water for both of us, so he shot himself in the head. 
 And as much as he was doing it to give me a chance to survive, I believe that he was also atoning for his sins. 
 I need to right the wrongs done by my family, and I'm offering you the chance to right the wrongs done to yours. 
 Oliver, what are you talking about? 
 The police never caught your brother's shooter. 
 Hey, you leave Andy out of this. 
 The bullets were laced with curare. 
 That's Floyd Lawton's M.O. 
 He is the sniper that I stopped. 
 Are you trying to tell me that you took down Andy's killer? 
 I'm--I'm giving you the chance, a chance to help other people's families. 
 Do you remember when the people in this city helped each other? 
 They can't do that anymore, because a group of people, people like my father, they see nothing wrong with raising themselves up by stepping on other people's throats. 
 It does need to stop, and if it's not gonna be the courts and it's not gonna be the cops... 
 Then it's gonna be me. 
 And, I hope, you. 
 I'm gonna go to the washroom, Rob. 
 Oh, that boy's long gone, man. 
 Phew. 
 You still following the money trail? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Don't we have accountants for that sort of thing? 
 They're being singularly ineffective in this instance. 
 Well, then... it's fortunate that I've solved the mystery. 
 I think I'm the culprit. 
 2.6 million is a rather specific figure. 
 That's the exact amount the company invested in a friend's start-up venture 3 years ago. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I will call accounting. 
 They'll clean it all up. 
 Then there's nothing to worry about. 
 Ok. 
 Heh. 
 You really are putting a lot of hours into this Declan thing. 
 You actually think he's innocent. 
 Someone does. 
 So you said, but you didn't say who. 
 The guardian angel. 
 The guy in the hood? 
 Look, you're-- you're kidding. 
 He tracked me down and asked me to look into the Declan case. 
 But you've met him? 
 But he goes against everything that I was ever taught to believe in. 
 He breaks the law and God knows what else. 
 How are you not afraid that he is gonna do God knows what to you? 
 He won't. 
 I don't know. 
 I can feel it. 
 You know, when I told you to meet someone, this is far, far away from what I meant. 
 
 
 
 I got your message. 
 Is there a reason we can't do this face to face? 
 You've met with Peter Declan. 
 You were right. 
 He might be innocent. 
 Declan said his wife blew the whistle on Brodeur the day she was murdered. 
 Then we need to get whoever she told about Brodeur to testify. 
 He already has. 
 Matt Istook, Camille's supervisor. 
 Only, he says that she didn't say a word to him. 
 He could be lying. 
 Well, if he is, then he's very convincing. 
 He had the jury and police believing him. 
 He hasn't been questioned by me. 
 I didn't become a lawyer to break the law or hurt anybody. 
 I do what's necessary, what people like Peter Declan need. 
 If what you're doing isn't wrong... 
 Then why are you hiding your face with a hood? 
 To protect the ones I care about. 
 That sounds lonely. 
 It can be. 
 But not today. 
 [Elevator dings] 
 I've got one question. 
 Why am I being fired? 
 Ms. Smoak, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 And I am without a doubt the single most valuable member of your technical division. 
 That's including my so-called "supervisor." 
 Letting me go would be a major error for this company. 
 I agree, which is why you're not being fired. 
 Uh, I assumed when you brought me up here, it was because... 
 It's because I wanted you to look into something for me. 
 A variance of $2.6 million on a failed investment from 3 years ago. 
 It was authorized by my wife. 
 I was hoping you could find out some of the details of the transaction for me. 
 Find out... 
 Dig up discreetly. 
 I'm your girl. 
 I mean, I'm not your girl. 
 I wasn't making a pass at you. 
 Thank you for not firing me. 
 [Alarm beeps off] 
 [Whoosh] 
 Ahh. 
 What the... 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 [Groans] 
 Matt Istook. 
 You're him, that hood guy. 
 You're the guy that's been terrorizing the city. 
 Peter Declan, your lies helped put him on death row. 
 Now, either it's time to tell me the truth, or it's time for the 10:15 to Blüdhaven. 
 [Stammers] O-ok. 
 Ok, I-- 
 Brodeur paid me to-- to say that Camille never spoke to me, but I didn't have anything to do with her death. 
 Oh, God, please. 
 I'll do anything. 
 Y-you could have the file. 
 What file? 
 Camille gave me a file of evidence against Jason Brodeur. 
 Where is it?! 
 Let me go, and I'll tell you. 
 [Whistle blowing] 
 Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! 
 Don't go! It's in my desk! 
 The file, it's in my desk at the office! 
 You can have it! 
 Get me out of here! 
 What is that? 
 I'm so hungry. 
 It smells really good. 
 Aah! 
 Hey, fine. Don't share. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Bird chirping] 
 Shengcún. 
 I'm not gonna kill the bird. 
 Shengcún. 
 Oliver : Compliments of Matt Istook. 
 What's in here? 
 Leverage on Jason Brodeur, enough to help save Peter Declan's life. 
 As an attorney, I never would have gotten a file like this. 
 I always thought the law was sacred, i-it fixed everything. 
 And now, Laurel? 
 Now what do you think? 
 I think there's too many people in this city who only care about themselves... people who are selfish. 
 I think they need someone who cares about the lives of other people... someone like you. 
 ♪ God, give me your shelter ♪ 
 [Vocalizing] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Oh, my God. 
 What is wrong with your face? 
 What do you mean? 
 There's something really weird on it, like this thing with your mouth. 
 It--it looks like it's in the shape of a smile. 
 That's cute. 
 So why are you grinning? 
 I took your advice with Laurel to be myself. 
 And... 
 It's helping. 
 Got mad relationship skills, bro. 
 Let me know if you need trendy places to propose. 
 I think you're getting a little bit ahead of yourself. 
 Mm. 
 Little bit. 
 Rob. 
 You gotta keep up. 
 Hey, you look busy. 
 Is that the Declan case? 
 You know, it was a funny development on Matt Istook. 
 He, uh, filed a police report. 
 He said the hood harassed him last night. 
 And that's funny, because I gave my daughter Istook's name. 
 Dad-- 
 He's a vigilante. 
 He's a damn criminal, and you working with him, that makes you an accessory. 
 I am trying to save an innocent man's life. 
 No. 
 You're breaking the law. 
 Well, I wouldn't have to if the police would have done their job right in the first place. 
 I asked you how you got this case. 
 You lied to me straight to my face, eh? 
 I thought you and I didn't do that. 
 Guess I was wrong. 
 The mere existence of the file proves that Mr. Istook perjured himself for Jason Brodeur's benefit. 
 That's slander. 
 Jared Swanstrom, Your Honor. 
 I represent Jason Brodeur and Brodeur Chemical. 
 The interest of justice requires you to stay the defendant's execution pending exploration of the newly discovered evidence. 
 Ours isn't a court of justice, Ms. Lance. 
 It's a court of law, and under the law, I don't think your evidence is sufficient to warrant a stay of execution. 
 Your motion for habeas corpus is denied. 
 This isn't over. 
 I've got the loose end now, and no matter what happens, I am going to pull on it until your whole world unravels. 
 Brodeur : Declan's lawyer's pulling me into this. 
 I'm gonna go to prison, if not for murder, then this-- this dumping thing. 
 That won't happen. 
 There are steps we can take. 
 You saw her. 
 She's going after me. 
 [Sighs] She's gonna want to meet with her client after what happened in court today. 
 We have friends up in Iron Heights. 
 Prison can be a dangerous place. 
 We're not done yet. 
 I'm an attorney. 
 Trust me. 
 We're done. 
 What do you need to free Peter Declan? 
 At this point, nothing short of a signed confession from Brodeur. 
 Where are you going? 
 To get a confession. 
 The company Mrs. Queen-- or Steele. 
 Mrs. Queen-Steele. 
 She hyphenate? 
 She seems like a woman who would hyphenate. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Right. 
 The company she invested in doesn't exist. 
 I don't understand. 
 There was no investment. 
 The money was used to set up an offshore LLC called Tempest. 
 I don't recall that name being under the Queen Consolidated banner. 
 'Cause it's not. 
 There's nothing registered with the Secretary of State, no federal tax records, no patent applications filed. 
 But in 2009, Tempest purchased a warehouse in Starling City. 
 Enough moping. 
 Mm. 
 You quit. It's done. 
 My advice would be to move on. 
 Well, if it were only that easy. 
 Except it is. 
 Personal security is dangerous. 
 Your nephew already lost his father. 
 He can't lose his uncle, too. 
 Does it ever bother you they never caught the guy who killed Andy? 
 You know, when I was in Afghanistan, I had a job, and I did it. 
 And when I could, I would help out the people there so that, in some small way, when I left, I could believe I left it a better place. 
 But ever since I've been home, all I do is protect punks and spoiled one percenters. 
 Yeah. 
 I miss feeling like I'm making a difference in the world. 
 Then get out of personal security and go do something you believe in. 
 Yeah, what if it's wrong? 
 John, if you believe in something, how can it be wrong? 
 What do you want? 
 You're gonna confess that you arranged to have Peter Declan's wife murdered. 
 What, so I can take his place in prison? 
 So you can avoid the death penalty. 
 Except if I'm dead, well, then, you've got no one to pin Camille's murder on. 
 You need me to exonerate Peter Declan. 
 Maybe you could try to force me to sign a confession or something. 
 Yaah! 
 That might be difficult. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 My hand! 
 Just answer it. 
 What? 
 It's Ankov. 
 It's going down, one hour. 
 What's going down in an hour? 
 What?! 
 Let's just say... 
 Peter Declan's execution, it's getting moved up. 
 [Yells] 
 We still have a shot. 
 Do you remember the friend that I mentioned, the one who believes in you? 
 He is working on something. 
 I told you, Jason Brodeur is powerful. 
 Time to unlock the cages. 
 I've been here before. 
 These lawyers holding out these little nuggets of hope. 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 [Alarm blaring] Secure all corners in cell block "C". 
 The warden's setting up a secure perimeter in "C" block. 
 Stay here, Ms. Lance. 
 Wait! 
 There's Lance. 
 [Arrow thunks] 
 Let's go. 
 Stop. 
 [Guards yelling orders] 
 Get down! 
 Get down! 
 Get out there! 
 Stay down! 
 Stay down! 
 Don't move! 
 [Vehicle sirens wailing] 
 [Sighs] Laurel. 
 Sweetie. 
 What are you-- 
 I'm all right. 
 You sure? 
 I'm sorry about what I said to you. 
 Yeah, well, you were right. 
 Ankov just confessed to Camille Declan's murder. 
 We got the wrong guy. 
 Now, listen to me, Laurel. 
 I'm right, too, about him. 
 He's dangerous. 
 He's outside the law. 
 I know. 
 He's a killer. 
 He would have killed that man. 
 I looked in his eyes, it's like he had no remorse. 
 [Bird chirping] 
 Hey, please. 
 I'm starving. 
 I never killed anything before. 
 [Squawks] 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Bone cracks] 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Quentin : Let's get you home, sweetie. 
 How'd he get into that prison, anyway, huh? 
 A grown man in an outfit and a hood, that kind of stands out a little, doesn't it? 
 He actually wasn't wearing the outfit this time. 
 He was in a prison guard uniform and a ski mask. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 I just had an idea. 
 Get in the car. 
 [Buzzer] 
 [Buzzer] 
 [Buzzer] 
 [Door unlocks] 
 Ok, here's the security footage from the Exchange building shooting, but I've already scrubbed through all of it. 
 Yeah? Well, we're gonna do it again. 
 So, listen, when you went through the camera security tapes, you were looking for a guy in a green outfit and a green hood, right? 
 What do you want me to look for, a man in a wig and a tutu? 
 I want you to look for anything that's out of the ordinary, ok? Just look. 
 [Tape fast-forwards] 
 Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Wait. Wait. 
 Go back 10 seconds. 
 What is that? 
 Quentin : I'll be damned. 
 Play that again. 
 Thank you, Laurel. 
 Don't thank me. 
 Thank Brodeur's bodyguard Ankov for flipping him. 
 I think there's someone that wants to see you. 
 Izzy. 
 [Peter crying] 
 Reporter : At least 5 federal, state, and local agencies are seeking millions of dollars in fines and environmental cleanup costs from Brodeur Chemical, new facts have come to light that Brodeur Chemical employee Camille Declan had discovered Brodeur was illegally disposing waste and had collected a file of evidence against her employer before her murder in 2007. 
 Peter Declan, who was convicted of killing his wife, has been released, and the case has been reopened. 
 Shengcún. 
 Yeah. 
 Bird. I know. 
 Shengcún not mean "bird." 
 Shengcún mean "survive." 
 You speak English. 
 You want survive this place, bird not last thing you kill. 
 And forget her. 
 You look at that all day, you not survive this place. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 You look nervous, Moira. 
 Hmm. Do I have a reason to be? 
 We all do. 
 A modern-day Robin Hood. 
 What, are you worried that your net worth makes you a target? 
 Jason Brodeur, Adam Hunt, Warren Patel. 
 Tell me you see a connection, Moira. 
 He's not targeting the rich. 
 No, he's not. 
 He's targeting the list. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You here for the bodyguard position? 
 'Cause the new guy just quit. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I'm here about the other position. 
 Just to be clear, I'm not signing on to be a sidekick. 
 But you're right. 
 Fighting for this city needs to be done, and you're gonna do this with or without me. 
 Yeah. 
 But with me, there'll be fewer casualties, including you. 
 Diggle, I'm not looking for anybody to save me. 
 Maybe not, but you need someone just the same. 
 You are fighting a war, Queen, except you have no idea what war does to you, how it scrapes off little pieces of your soul. 
 And you need someone to remind you of who you are, not this thing you're becoming. 
 [Siren blares] 
 [Tires skid] 
 [Door opens] Oliver Queen. 
 What is this? 
 You can't just barge in here. 
 Yeah? Well, I got a badge and a gun that say different. 
 Hey, what the hell's going on?! 
 Detective Lance-- 
 Oliver Queen, you're under arrest on suspicion of obstruction of justice, aggravated assault... 
 What is going on? 
 Walter, stop them! 
 Trespassing, acting as a vigilante... 
 Are you out of your mind?!
