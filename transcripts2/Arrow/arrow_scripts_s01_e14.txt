 My name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years I was stranded on an island with only one goal-- survive. 
 Oliver Queen is alive. 
 Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish-- to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 
 Previously on "Arrow"... 
 Slade Wilson. 
 There's an airfield 10 clicks from here. 
 It's key off this island. 
 I think Yao Fei sent you because he knows I cannot take the airstrip alone. 
 You bugged my mother? 
 Just listen. 
 Moira : I made it clear to him persuasively that his plans endangered the undertaking. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I need to have another chat with my mom. 
 And I'll need the Unidac merger finalized by the end of the week. 
 We're on something of a clock here. 
 [Voice disguised] 
 Moira Queen, you have failed this city. 
 Stand still! 
 Please don't kill me. 
 Do you know anything about your husband's disappearance? 
 What?! 
 Is Walter Steel still alive?! 
 I don't know where my husband is. 
 I swear. 
 Do you know anything about the Undertaking? 
 I said don't move! 
 I'm--I'm a mother. 
 I have a son--Oliver. 
 A daughter, her name is Thea. 
 She's just a teenager. 
 Please don't take me from my children. 
 They lost their father. 
 They can't lose me, too. 
 Please, whoever you are, please. 
 Okay. 
 I'm not going to hurt you. 
 This is Moira Queen, I'm on the 39th floor, I need help. 
 There's an intruder. 
 Please! 
 
 Arrow 
Season 1 Episode 14 
 The Odyssey 
Original Air Date on February 13, 2013 
 
 [Car alarm chirps] 
 [Starts engine] 
 Ohh! 
 I'm not going to hurt you, Felicity. 
 How do you know my name? 
 Because you know my name. 
 [Stammering] 
 Oliver, oh... 
 Wow. 
 Everything about you just became so unbelievably clear. 
 You're bleeding. 
 I don't need to be told that. 
 You need a hospital. 
 My--my father's old factory, in the Glades. 
 No, you-- you need a doctor, not a steelworker. 
 Felicity...You have to promise me that you are going to take me to my father's factory and nowhere else. 
 Yeah, promise. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Something tells me blood stains are not covered under my lease. 
 Reporter : So far the police are unwilling to comment, but unsubstantiated eyewitness reports claims that the Starling City vigilante attacked Mrs. Queen in her office earlier tonight. 
 She was unharmed in the assault. 
 Felicity : Excuse me. 
 Can you help me? 
 He's really heavy! 
 Oh, damn it. 
 He just missed a carotid. 
 It's a zone two wound. 
 Press there. 
 I should have taken him to a hospital. 
 No, Felicity, that's why he asked you to bring him here. 
 Because he knew the police would want to know how and why he got the wound. 
 I'm guessing how and why are Oliver Queen's least favorite questions. 
 Yeah, well, there's also when and where, he's not too fond of. 
 So if we can't bring him to the hospital... 
 We bring the hospital to him. 
 Is that... 
 Yeah. His blood. 
 He stored it for a rainy day. 
 And I say right now, it's pouring. 
 I got it. 
 Over there. 
 Do you know what you're doing? 
 Yeah, I had some medical training in the army. 
 I just hope it's enough. 
 Remember playing "Operation" when you were a kid? 
 Yes. 
 And it never made me want to throw up. 
 Hey, Felicity, listen, trust me. 
 He'll be fine. 
 He's been through a lot worse than this. 
 [Both grunting] 
 Ah, dead. 
 [Both grunting] 
 How did you survive here for six months? 
 I know girl scouts who have more fight in them. 
 Fighting girl scouts now, Slade, huh? 
 Oww! 
 What the hell?! 
 Listen, kid. 
 We have ten days until the supply plane lands. 
 Ten days to turn you into at least half a soldier. 
 So start taking it seriously. 
 [Both grunting] 
 [Groaning] 
 What is the point of this?! 
 These soldiers don't carry bamboo! 
 They have guns! 
 So what am I supposed to do if one them jams a gun in my face, huh? 
 Threaten them with my stick?! 
 Jam this in my face. 
 Do it. 
 [Both grunting] 
 I give up. 
 I give up. 
 There is no giving up to these guys! 
 No crying, or buying your way out of it! 
 You have two choices-- escape, or die. 
 So choose. 
 Escape. 
 Then let me show you how not to die. 
 Lian Yu. 
 It's the name of the island, I know. 
 It's Mandarin for "Purgatory". 
 It is? Wonderful. 
 Is that the air strip? 
 A.S.I.S. took satellite images of the whole island. 
 This is Fyers' main camp, where I was held for almost a year. 
 Do--do you think that's where Yao Fei is now? 
 'Cause we could get a message to him. 
 We can tell him we found a way off the island. 
 Forget about him. 
 This is the airstrip. 
 And these infrared images show there are at last ten soldiers guarding the perimeter at any given time. 
 Too many of 'em for you? 
 No. 
 My problem is the guy here in the tower. 
 It's a PTAC. A portable air traffic control tower. 
 The U.S. government set up these for disaster zones, like Thailand after the Tsunami. 
 So what's the problem? 
 The glass is bulletproof. 
 I can't take out the tower guard with my sniper rifle. 
 And if he suspects anything's wrong, he'll radio Fyers and we're cancelled. 
 It'll be up to you to take him out. 
 Up close and personal. 
 Are you ready for that? 
 Do you think I'm ready? 
 What I think is there's only one supply plane every 3 months. 
 We leave tomorrow, or we die soon afterwards. 
 I pick leaving. 
 So get some sleep. 
 We leave at 0600. 
 Don't worry. 
 You'll be back with your girlfriend soon enough. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Sighs] 
 Morning. 
 Please don't hate me. 
 Why would I hate you? 
 For cheating on you with Sara. 
 Did it hurt, Ollie? 
 Did what hurt? 
 When they killed you? 
 [Gasps] 
 Rise and shine. 
 Come on. 
 We're moving out. 
 All clear. 
 Hey, can we, um, can we rest for a second? 
 You can rest on the plane. 
 Gosh, well, really looking forward to that in-flight movie. 
 [Click] 
 Oh, God. 
 Don't move. 
 Is it a mine? 
 Yeah. 
 The soldiers mine the island? 
 No, it's probably Japanese, left over from World War II. 
 Still active. 
 Impressive. 
 Can you disarm it? 
 Without disarming you? 
 Soldiers. 
 Can they see us? 
 They can only see you. 
 Wait! Stop! 
 What are you doing so far from camp? 
 I got separated from my unit. 
 Come with us. 
 I--I can't. 
 I'm kind of having a bad day, you know? 
 [Slade yelling] 
 Be still. 
 Thanks. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Yao Fei. 
 Come in. Sit. 
 Now the first time I saw you with this contraption... 
 I thought you looked utterly ridiculous. 
 That is, until you took out three of my best men with it. 
 25 compound bows will be arriving on tomorrow's supply plane. 
 I'd like you to train a few of my men on how to use them. 
 Archery can take years to master. 
 Well, I trust you'll be a proficient instructor. 
 That'll be all. 
 I hope you are steadfast in your commitment to our cause, Yao Fei. 
 For her sake. 
 I am. 
 Obviously you were never a boy scout. 
 Yeah? What tipped you off? 
 We better hurry. 
 The wolves come out at night. 
 There are wolves here? 
 Right. Of course there are. 
 Because what would the worst place on earth be without wolves. 
 The only thing that will keep them out is fire. 
 Well, you know, you're welcome to help. 
 Seriously? 
 I've been working on this for two hours. 
 I know. I was watching you. 
 Thank you for the entertainment. 
 [Owl hooting] 
 You're going to wear that thing out just by looking at it. 
 Don't worry. 
 She'll be waiting for flowers when you get back. 
 I doubt it. 
 Remember how I told you I was shipwrecked here? 
 Her sister was with me when the boat went down. 
 That's funny. I never took you as being the bad boy. 
 You seem to lack the spine. 
 That's why I've got to get home. 
 To make this right. 
 If you think you can sleep with your girlfriend's sister and still make it right... 
 You're dumber than I thought. 
 And believe me when I tell you that is saying something. 
 Yeah, well, you don't really strike me as the type of guy who accepts apologies, so. 
 Well, everybody is in this life for themselves. 
 Learn that at Australian spy school? 
 No. I learned that here. 
 Do you remember I told you that I had a partner? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you remember the guy who tortured you? 
 [Screaming] 
 That freak show was your partner?! 
 His name's Billy Wintergreen. 
 Oh. Ok. 
 Our mission was to exfiltrate Yao Fei and to find out why Fyers and his men were so interested in him. 
 But our bird got shot out of the sky before we even saw the airstrip. 
 That's where I found you. 
 When Fyers took us prisoner, he asked if we would join him and his men. 
 Billy accepted Fyers' invitation. 
 I declined. 
 He was the godfather to my son Joe. 
 And yet, he turned his back on me without even thinking twice about it. 
 Everybody is in this life for themselves! 
 If you let him radio camp, we're done. 
 What about the others? 
 You worry about your one. 
 I'll worry about my ten. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Beeping] 
 Felicity : Good job. 
 I think. 
 His heart rate's elevated, but at least the bleeding stopped. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 You kept your head on. 
 Well, I always wondered how I'd react if I found my boss shot and bleeding inside my car. 
 Not that I helped because he's my boss. 
 I'd help anyone who was shot and bleeding in my car. 
 I was thinking all of this would be more of a shock. 
 What, are you saying you called this all along? 
 I'm not saying anything. 
 Except Oliver brought me a laptop riddled with bullet holes, had me trace a black arrow, and research a company involved in armored car heists. 
 I may be blonde, but I'm not that blonde. 
 Yeah, Oliver's not too great with the cover stories. 
 Neither are you. 
 The two of you with that whole energy drink hangover cure? 
 Please. 
 What was really in that vial, anyway? 
 Vertigo. 
 I knew it! 
 I mean, I didn't know it was Vertigo for sure, but I definitely knew it wasn't something that could cure a hangover. 
 Yeah, we needed it analyzed so we could take down the count. 
 That was you and Oliver? 
 And you, Felicity. 
 Without you, we never would have found him. 
 But why come to me? 
 Hard as it probably is for him to admit, even Oliver needs help sometimes. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Grunting and groaning] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 What's happening?! 
 There's a syringe labeled Ativan. 
 It should stop the seizure. Go. 
 [Beeping stops] 
 His heart stopped. 
 I'm calling 9-1-1. 
 No. Wait, you can't. 
 You know how to use one of those? 
 We are about to find out. 
 [Paddles beep] 
 You didn't say clear! 
 [Beep] 
 I heard the charge. 
 That's good news. 
 How's that? 
 It means it might not be the machine, it could be the wiring. 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! 
 Try again. 
 Clear. 
 [Beeping] 
 [Exhales] 
 
 
 
 What the hell did you do? 
 I've been building computers since I was seven. 
 Wires are wires. 
 What do we do now? 
 Pray we don't have a heart attack ourselves. 
 [Gasps] 
 One job to do, and you manage to screw up even then. 
 I'm going to go make sure that everything is clear. 
 Stay here, keep the door locked. 
 Do not let anybody in except for me. 
 You got that? 
 Yeah. 
 Here. Keep this. 
 And try not to shoot yourself by mistake. 
 [Dial tone] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Line ringing] 
 Laurel : Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Is anybody there? 
 Have you lost your mind? 
 They might be monitoring the calls. 
 Man on radio : Island tower. 
 This is Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot, we are 700 kilometers southeast of your position. 
 ETA, three hours, 22 minutes, over. 
 Island tower, Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot. 
 Acknowledged. 
 Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot. 
 Acknowledged. 
 Of all creatures that breath and move upon the earth. 
 What is that? 
 It's a challenge code. 
 They're trying to verify our identity. 
 Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot. 
 Please repeat. 
 Of all creatures that breathe and move upon the earth. 
 Wait. 
 What? 
 Wait, I know this. 
 I know this. 
 They picked the one book that I read in college. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 A quote, from "The Odyssey". 
 Ohh. 
 Of all creatures that breathe and move upon the earth, nothing--nothing is born that is weaker than man. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 Because if you're wrong, this plane will turn around. 
 Yes, yes. I'm positive. 
 Nothing is born that is weaker than man. 
 Say it. 
 Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 Bred. 
 Not born, bred. 
 Nothing is bred that is weaker than man. 
 That's it. 
 Nothing is bred that is weaker than man. 
 Roger that. 
 See you in a few hours. 
 Out. 
 "The Odyssey". 
 Yeah! It's, uh, well, it's a story about a guy who's trying to get home, so. 
 [Exhales] Well, after a few days at Langstughl Airbase, you'll be on your way home. 
 But you sound like you're not coming with me. 
 I'll be coming with you. 
 After I radio in an airstrike on this location. 
 I'm going to send Fyers and all his men straight back to hell. 
 Wait. 
 You can't blow up the island. 
 Yao Fei is still out there. 
 He is not my concern. 
 Really? 
 He's the only reason you came here. 
 Rescuing him was your mission! 
 Well, the mission has changed. 
 Edward Fyers is a mercenary and he is not on this island by mistake. 
 He has plans for me and you that involve Yao Fei. 
 And whatever they are, they must end. 
 Yao Fei saved my life. 
 That is your debt to repay, not mine. 
 Where are you going?! 
 All my life, all that I've ever thought about is myself. 
 I took my family for granted. 
 I betrayed people that I loved. 
 And I'm not going to be that person anymore. 
 I can't leave Yao Fei here to die. 
 I won't. 
 The plane leaves in three hours. 
 If you and your friend are not on it, I am going to leave without you. 
 If I don't make it back in time, and you get out of here... 
 I want you to call my family. 
 Call my family. 
 Sure, kid. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Monitor flatlining] 
 He's going into cardiac arrest again. 
 No. 
 Ah. The leads just came loose. 
 Arghh! 
 It's less stressful when he's jumping off rooftops. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Ohh. 
 This bow has put arrows in quite a few people. 
 Yeah, bad people. 
 That doesn't bother you? 
 Because... 
 And I mean this in a good way, you seem like the kind of guy it would bother. 
 When I was in Afghanistan, my unit was tasked with protecting this local war lord. 
 Gholem Qadir. 
 Qadir was less than human, sold opium. 
 Sold children. 
 One day, we were accompanying him to Mosul when my convoy was ambushed by insurgents. 
 We had them outgunned. 
 Fire fight didn't last more than a minute. 
 When the smoke cleared, I moved in on their position. 
 They were all dead. 
 I knew which one I had killed. 
 When I pulled off his keffiyeh, I could see it was just a kid, no more than 18. 
 Shot him in the throat. 
 I killed this kid to protect this human piece of garbage, and I thought, am I still good? 
 Am I still a good man? 
 Doing this with Oliver; doing what we do, I feel good again for the first time in a long time. 
 And that's worth all the collateral damage? 
 I haven't killed anyone, if that's what you're asking. 
 But he has. 
 Unfortunately, there are always casualties when you're fighting a war. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 How did you... 
 Come on, let's go. 
 I'll explain on the way. 
 Stupid boy. You should never have come back here! 
 I found Slade Wilson and he has a way off the island, but we have to go right now. 
 No. No! 
 What? What do you mean, no? 
 This is our chance. 
 What--what reason could you possibly have for staying here?! 
 Not what. Who. 
 Ah, Mr. Queen, I think it's past time you left this island. 
 Permanently. 
 Man on radio : Island tower, Seahawk 801 Foxtrot. 
 We are 5,000 feet and holding, over. 
 Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot. 
 This is island tower. 
 You're clear to land. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Simply to satisfy my own curiosity, why aren't you already dead? 
 I saw Yao Fei choke you to death. 
 I guess he's not as strong as he looks. 
 [Laughter] 
 Still, you return for him. 
 So you're either a fool, or is it possible you now think yourself a hero? 
 I'm not a hero. 
 Of course not. 
 It's not possible to be a hero when there's nobody worthy of saving. 
 Is this what you want? 
 Did you want me to fight him again?! 
 Oh, no, Mr. Queen. 
 That's where you're mistaken. 
 This is not a match. 
 It's an execution. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's Wintergreen, right? 
 Bill Wintergreen? 
 [Groaning] 
 I know all about you. 
 I know you work for the Australian government. 
 And that you used to fight for your country. 
 You used to stand for something! 
 Whatever he's paying you, I'll triple it. 
 [Gunshots] 
 How many of them are there?! 
 Slade. Come back to die? 
 [Both grunting] 
 Was it so easy to betray me, Billy? 
 [Both grunting] 
 You know, Billy... 
 You always had a good kick. 
 [Slice] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Plane overhead] 
 There goes our ride. 
 [groaning and screaming] 
 Wow. 
 [Gasping] 
 I'm impressed. 
 You didn't puke. 
 I swallowed it. 
 You can untie me now. 
 Why'd you want me to tie you up in the first place? 
 A man in pain is unreliable. 
 I was afraid I might kill you. 
 Thanks. 
 What? 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's just... 
 What? 
 I'm trapped on an island and my only friend is named Wilson. So. 
 What now? 
 We hope my fireworks show set Fyers back, maybe enough for those who hired him in the first place to call things off. 
 Hired him? 
 Well, Fyers is a merc. 
 He follows the money. 
 So he's on this island under someone's employ. 
 Then what do we do? 
 We have to make sure that neither of us dies on this godforsaken island. 
 I though you said if we didn't get on the plane... 
 We weren't going to make it. 
 Well, that dumb kid that I trained, he would never have made it. 
 You? 
 You might just have a chance. 
 Yep, it's Fyers. 
 Man : Satellites showed multiple heat blooms on the island. 
 What the hell is happening there? 
 There was a complication. 
 Slade Wilson? 
 I'm handling it. 
 Well, handle it better. 
 I've worked too hard and planned for too long to have complications arise so close to the end. 
 I assure you, it won't happen again. 
 What about Yao Fei? 
 I've ensured his cooperation. 
 Good. I've paid you a lot of money, Fyers. 
 I expect a return on my investment. 
 You sent for me. 
 I'm a man of my word. 
 You made the right call today, turning in your young castaway. 
 And for that, I'll grant you five minutes. 
 Shado? Shado! 
 Shado! 
 [Both speaking mandarin] 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 [Speaking Mandarin] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I guess I didn't die. 
 Again. 
 Cool. 
 It's not bad. 
 So how am I going to explain this one? 
 Hickey gone wrong? 
 The police collected a sample of your blood at Queen Consolidated. 
 I just hacked the crime lab and ordered the sample destroyed. 
 Oops. Heh. 
 I hope it's all right. 
 Your system looked like it was from the eighties, and not the good part of the eighties, like Madonna and, well, legwarmers. 
 It's a lot of work. 
 Does that mean you're in? 
 You mean in as in I'm going to join your crusade? 
 Well, you're practically an honorary member of the team already. 
 Hmm. So Mr. Diggle said. 
 No. 
 Then why'd you upgrade my system? 
 First, because seeing a network that poorly set up hurts me. In my soul. 
 And second... 
 I want to find Walter. 
 My stepfather. 
 He was nice to me. 
 And Mr. Diggle told me that the notebook you use to fight crime is the same notebook that got Walter abducted. 
 I'll help you rescue him, but that's it. 
 Then I want to go back to my boring life of being an I.T. girl. 
 That's my offer. 
 Ok. 
 So I've been meaning to ask... 
 Is there a bathroom? 'Cause I've had to pee since I got here. 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's upstairs to the left. 
 Great. 
 Felicity. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Oliver, I know you don't want to hurt this girl and you didn't have any choice in telling her who you really were, but we're asking her to get involved in some pretty dangerous stuff. 
 We can protect her. 
 How? 
 Your mother just shot you, Oliver. 
 You can't even keep yourself safe. 
 She was scared. 
 She was defending herself. 
 Or, she was hiding something. 
 Like maybe her involvement in Walter's disappearance, or worse. 
 Diggle, we don't always know why people do what they do. 
 But what I do know is that when I was standing in her office with an arrow aimed at her heart, she begged me to spare her, all on behalf of me and Thea. 
 Now, I've taken down a lot of bad people. 
 None of them brought up their kids, Dig. 
 Oliver, she had the list. 
 Now she may not be in charge of whatever "it" is, but she's definitely involved. 
 Involved in what?! 
 We don't even know what "it" is, and until we do, she is off limits! 
 Am I clear? 
 But Oliver, are you saying this because you truly believe she's innocent? 
 Or because you don't want to face the fact that your mother might be guilty? 
 [Indistinct] 
 Moira : 6'1, and a deep voice. I-- 
 Hey. 
 What's going on? 
 Where have you been? 
 I've been calling you all night. 
 I was at the club. I get zero reception in there. 
 Maybe it's time you invest in a land line. 
 Thea. 
 Your mother was attacked last night. 
 By the Vigilante. 
 What?! 
 He came after me at the office. 
 Did he hurt you? 
 Are you ok? 
 Actually, she hurt him. 
 She shot him point blank with a gun hidden in her office. 
 That should help with your investigation. 
 Did you get any evidence, like a blood sample, or... 
 There was a screw-up at the lab. 
 That's too bad. 
 Hmm. 
 We'll be in touch. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, sweetheart. 
 I was so scared. 
 I'm just glad you're ok. 
 I thought he was going to kill me. 
 Hey. 
 I promise you, he's never going to bother you again.
