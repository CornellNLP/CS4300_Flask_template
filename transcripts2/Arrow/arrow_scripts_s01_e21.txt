 My name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal-- survive. 
 Oliver Queen is alive. 
 Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish-- to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 
 Previously on "Arrow"... 
 Felicity, I want you to find out all you can about that notebook. 
 I'll be driving your mother around for a few days. 
 She's not a suspect. 
 Oliver, something's going on in this city. You know it. 
 Walter, please. You've got to stop looking into this. 
 It's not safe. 
 Well, accidents tend to befall people who are too curious. 
 And he won't be harmed? 
 It's done. 
 Nor will ever discover your involvement. You have my word. 
 I'm not sure I'm ready for the kind of commitment that you're looking for. 
 You can't be serious. 
 This is me serious, Laurel. 
 [Beep] 
 Call Cayman Fidelity. 
 Tell them their favorite accountant is flying in to make a special deposit for a special client. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 That elevator's supposed to be on a key. 
 Go. Check it out. 
 Harold Backman, you have failed this city. 
 I'm only an accountant. 
 I'm just the money. 
 The money that leads to extortion, kidnapping, and drugs. 
 It's the destruction of innocent lives! 
 You think you scare me more than the people I work for? 
 No. 
 They can deal with you. 
 Hmm. Let me guess. 
 Some bad guy missing his fancy new laptop. 
 Harold Backman. He's who Starling City's worst call when they want to launder money in the Caymans. 
 Shouldn't we just turn this over to, I don't know, the IRS? 
 We will. Just as soon as you return the money to the rightful owners. 
 Well, it sounds like a very nice idea. 
 Backman's files are all protected with an asymmetric encryption algorithm. 
 Really? So it's gonna take a while to break in. 
 Days, at least. 
 Better get started, then. 
 At the risk of ending up with an arrow in my eye, can I ask... 
 When are you planning on making peace with Diggle? 
 He's the one who left, Felicity. 
 I did everything I could to stop him. 
 Except apologize. 
 You promised you'd help him track down Floyd Lawton and then you-- 
 Made a choice that I can live with. 
 If he can't, then I don't need him. 
 I need to get back to the club. 
 Oliver-- 
 Let me know when you break in. 
 I wish someone would send me off to the Caymans. 
 Yes, I know it's been 6 months. But-- 
 I am very well aware of the statistics. 
 But I haven't given up hope and neither should you. 
 That didn't sound too good. 
 Oh, it's fine. 
 Who were you talking to? 
 Just the insurance company. 
 They insist on paying out Walter's life insurance policy. 
 I know we haven't talked about Walter in a while, but I--I miss him, too. 
 It's like losing dad all over again. 
 You look radiant. 
 Flatterer. 
 I think you're the last to arrive. 
 How's Tommy? 
 Tommy is Tommy. 
 How's Oliver? 
 Still in bed. 
 It's only noon. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Well, look who I just found. 
 Get lost trying to find the house? 
 You say that as if your driveway's not longer than most roads. 
 Can I get anyone anything else? Frank? 
 We're fine, dear, thank you. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 Hello, Mrs. Queen. 
 I'm sorry to bother you at home. 
 Oh, no, no. Don't be silly, Walter. 
 Come in, please. 
 You're here to see Robert. 
 Yes. There's just some papers he needs to sign for the stock offering. 
 Well, he's in some private meeting right now, but you're welcome to wait for him in his study. 
 Thank you. 
 Unless you'd like to help me get my children out of the house. 
 You don't have children, do you, Walter? 
 Not yet, I'm afraid. 
 Well, save yourself the trouble and don't. 
 They eventually all turn into teenagers. 
 Adam Hunt was reluctant at first, but was more cooperative upon being informed we knew about his embezzlement. 
 Police communication system could use an upgrade. 
 I think Mr. Hunt can be persuaded to make an anonymous donation. 
 Well, that will certainly cure what ails this city. 
 What's that, Malcolm? 
 We're emptying the Atlantic with a tablespoon. 
 For years we've been forcing the city's worst to do what is best, leverage them to help us save the city. 
 But it's...not working. 
 Crime in the Glades is rising. 
 The cancer is spreading. 
 We just need to... 
 Take some more time. 
 Did Rebecca get more time? 
 Did the man who raped Frank's daughter give her any quarter? 
 Everyone in this room has lost something or someone to the Glades. 
 And we have committed ourselves to fixing it. 
 But what have we truly accomplished? 
 Nothing. 
 Maybe it's because the Glades can't be fixed. 
 You're saying we should abandon the project? 
 Yes. 
 In favor of a new undertaking. 
 Like Ben Tre in Vietnam. 
 The village must be destroyed before it can be saved. 
 Are you suggesting we somehow... level the Glades? 
 Down to the bedrock. 
 Only then can we truly rebuild Starling City and make it safer for everyone. 
 That's 24 square blocks. 
 And if we did-- and I'm not saying we should-- if we did, wouldn't suspicion fall on us? 
 Not if the destruction appears to be caused by a natural disaster. 
 You've always had something of a God complex, Malcolm. 
 It's part of your charm. 
 But even you can't create a natural disaster. 
 Have you ever heard of Unidac Industries? 
 It's a small company. 
 They have an idea... 
 An idea that will serve our purposes. 
 My sources tell me they're 5 years away from prototype. 
 And any undertaking of value is worthy of patience. 
 And restraint. 
 One man alone can't save this city, Robert, and we both know that. 
 Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine. 
 This coffee's terrible, Oliver. 
 That's what you get for ordering coffee in a bar. 
 You look tired. 
 Too much work? 
 Too much crying. 
 Tommy broke up with me. 
 What happened? 
 I have no idea. 
 Things were good. 
 They were... 
 Great, and then suddenly he's packing up his things and telling me that it's over. 
 Did he say anything to you? 
 No. Tommy and I haven't talked very much since he quit. 
 But he'll come around. 
 It's probably just cold feet. 
 Like it was with you. 
 Oliver, you don't sleep with your girlfriend's sister unless you're looking to blow the relationship up. 
 If you still want to be with Tommy, do what we should have done. 
 Talk to each other and be honest. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Oliver, I need to show you what-- 
 I just totally walked in on a thing, didn't I? 
 I'm sorry, uh, who are you? 
 Nobody. I mean, I'm not nobody. 
 I'm someone, obviously. 
 And so are you. 
 You're Laurel, right? 
 That Laurel. 
 Gorgeous Laurel. 
 This is Felicity. 
 She's setting up my Internet. 
 Router. And I need to show Oliver something very important related to it. 
 I'll let you go, then. 
 Thank you for the coffee... and the advice. 
 Tell me you got in. 
 Better. I hacked Cayman Fidelity and put together a list all the deposits Backman made last year. 
 Felicity, what good does that do us if we don't know whose money it was? 
 Look at the biggest deposit Backman made last year. 
 Bottom page. 
 $2 million on Decem-- 
 December 12. 
 That's... 
 The day Walter disappeared. 
 What if one of Backman's clients was paid 2 million to kidnap Walter? 
 Then we find out which client it was... 
 And we use them to find Walter. 
 
 Arrow 
Season 1 Episode 21 
 The Undertaking 
Original Air Date on May 1, 2013 
 
 Ok, back-trace the account, follow the money, hopefully it will lead us to whoever kidnapped Walter. 
 After all this time, do you think Walter might still really be alive? 
 I don't know. 
 Got it. 
 [Beep] 
 [Groans] 
 Dominic Alonzo. 
 Yeah. 
 Name ring a bell? 
 Alonzo runs the biggest underground casino in Starling City when he's not busy kidnapping. 
 He looks like the kind of lowlife someone would hire to kidnap Walter. 
 How many arrows do you think you'll have to put in him before he gives up Walter's location? 
 Say a lot? 
 It's not that simple. 
 That casino has its own private army. 
 We need to access Alonzo's computer, but without setting off any alarms. 
 Looks like we're gonna need all the help we can get. 
 It's too bad there's not someone else we could call. 
 That's enough. We can do this on our own. 
 Well, then... Looks like someone's going gambling tonight. 
 Those guys would make me the minute that I walked in there. 
 Oliver Queen would never be caught dead in a place like that. 
 I wasn't talking about you. 
 Absolutely not. 
 I can count cards. 
 It's all probability theory and mathematics. 
 Have you met me? 
 Bottom line--I know my way around a casino. 
 Felicity, I'm not letting you walk-- 
 The reason I joined you in the first place was to find Walter, and for the first time, we have a real chance of finding him. 
 You have to let me do this. 
 All right. 
 But we do it my way. 
 Come on. 
 I'm sorry I had to pull you away from whoever you were meeting. 
 Oh, it's nothing. 
 Everyone's left already. 
 Besides, it's my fault for forgetting to sign the K-5s this morning. 
 I hope you don't mind me asking, but is everything all right? 
 Just, uh, taking care of some odds and ends. 
 Well, if ever you need a friendly ear. 
 You're a good man, Walter. 
 I thought you'd left. 
 I'm still waiting for your answer. 
 How can you even think of doing this? 
 That place took your soul, Robert. 
 Doing this won't give it back. 
 It won't bring back Rebecca, either. 
 It still feels like yesterday, that day. 
 When she called my cell phone for the first time, I remember being annoyed. 
 She knew I was busy, so I just let it ring. 
 When she called back a minute later, I shut my phone off. 
 A little after midnight, two SCPD officers showed up in my office. 
 All I remember them saying was... 
 She'd been shot. 
 Murdered in the Glades. 
 After the cops left, I sat in my office the rest of the night listening to Rebecca's messages. 
 She kept calling my name... 
 Asking for help... until she was just struggling to breathe, gasping for air. 
 I listened to my wife die over and over and over again. 
 I can't imagine, Malcolm. 
 Try. 
 Imagine it was Moira lying on that pavement, bleeding, calling your name. 
 And then tell me you wouldn't be prepared to do what I am. 
 What do you want? 
 Is that any way to treat a girl who just walked up 6 flights of stairs? 
 No, it's not. Where are my manners? 
 Come on in. 
 Thank you. 
 Welcome. 
 Did you do these? 
 You know, Felicity, Oliver and I don't need a relationship counselor. 
 That hasn't been my experience. 
 We have a lead on Walter. 
 I need you to come back and help us find him. 
 Oliver put you up to this? 
 No. 
 He doesn't even know I'm here. 
 Look. 
 I know Oliver didn't help you find your brother's killer and that hurts. 
 It sucks. But... 
 You gotta know if it was your life on the line on not just your... very understandable vendetta, he would be there for you. 
 No hesitation. 
 And I don't want a partnership with those kind of qualifications, Felicity. 
 I know Oliver's religiously against admitting he's wrong. 
 Truth is, he needs you. 
 Yeah. 
 And when Oliver is ready to say that, he knows where I live. 
 [Sighs] 
 Sorry for bothering you. 
 It's no bother. 
 I hope you find him. 
 Wow, you really look like your father. 
 I never thought so before, but just now I saw him in you. 
 What are you doing here? 
 We need to talk. 
 I said everything I have to say. 
 Well, I haven't. 
 Tommy, I love you, and I think that you still love me, so whatever problems that you think that we have, I know that if we face them together-- 
 You don't understand. 
 Then help me understand. 
 If our relationship is gonna end, at least let it end with honesty. 
 Ok, Laurel. 
 Honestly... 
 You belong with Oliver. 
 Excuse me? 
 He's still in love with you. 
 I have a meeting. 
 You ready? 
 I think so. 
 Just to be clear, the plan is for me to get caught counting cards in an underground casino filled with hardened criminals. 
 So you can get a friendly warning from Alonzo and plant a bug on his office computer. 
 Right. Which will hopefully lead us to Walter. 
 That is assuming I get the friendly warning and not a bullet. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Ok. If anything happens, I'm right outside. 
 Ok. 
 Password. 
 Snapdragon. 
 Oliver : Password's snapdragon. 
 Password. 
 Snapdragon. 
 [Music playing, chatter] 
 Oliver : What do you see? 
 6 armed guards, 2 pit bosses, and a floor man. 
 No slot machines. 
 How do you call yourself a casino without any Lucky 7s? 
 Stay focused, please. 
 I'll be with you the entire time. 
 Thanks. 
 [Sighs] It feels really good having you inside me. 
 And by "you," 
 I mean your voice. 
 And by "me," I mean my ear. 
 I'm gonna stop talking right now. 
 That would be my preference. 
 One stack of High Society, please. 
 Thank you for stopping by. 
 Of course. 
 Uh, you said you had news. 
 I do. 
 It's ready. 
 The Markov device passed its final beta test this morning. 
 Applied Sciences is loading it on a truck bound for Starling City as we speak. 
 Well... 
 Congratulations are in order, then. 
 To both of us. 
 Moira, you may be surprised to know that I sometimes waver in my convictions. 
 But your friendship, your endless support... always gives me the strength to carry on. 
 After all, you and I will always have a connection. 
 I'm just sorry that Robert's not here to celebrate with us. 
 I'm sorry I had to take him from you. 
 If anyone's to blame for his death, it's me. 
 To Robert. 
 To Rebecca. 
 
 
 
 Are you feeling all right? 
 I know tonight was just another Ted Kord fund-raiser, but you were surprisingly quiet. 
 Moira, there's something I need to talk to you about. 
 Robert, if this is what I think it is, I don't want to know her name. I don't-- 
 No, it's about Malcolm. 
 He wants to level the Glades. 
 And how does Malcolm propose to evacuate an entire section of the city? 
 He doesn't. 
 Robert, that doesn't sound like you. 
 Because I'm not the man you think I am. 
 About a month before the opening of Steele factory, the one in the Glades, I was approached by a local councilman. 
 He wanted money. 
 Told me that's the way everything was done in the Glades. 
 I told him I'd never paid a bribe in my life. 
 We got into an argument. 
 I didn't want to hurt him. 
 I swear, Moira. 
 But he fell. 
 Oh, dear God. 
 Oh, dear God. 
 The work I'm doing with Malcolm, with the list, it's my penance, Moira. 
 What, so you'll atone for one murder by committing hundreds, thousands? 
 Oh... 
 Robert. 
 You listen to me. 
 Whatever wrongs you've committed, whatever mistakes you've made, preventing this horror is your chance to make it right. 
 Please... 
 Please, Robert, promise me you won't let this happen. 
 Oh! 
 Blackjack! 
 [Laughing] 
 Miss... 
 Can you come with me? 
 Is something wrong? 
 Get up. 
 Oh, since you ask so nicely. 
 Oh, there's the bathroom. 
 I should have known the manager's office would be down the hall and to the right of the bathroom. 
 Mr. Alonzo. 
 Have a seat. 
 What's your name? 
 Megan. 
 Do you know where the term "86" comes from, Megan? 
 As it happens, I do. 
 It's from prohibition. 
 There was a-- an illegal casino, not like this one, located at 86 Bedford street in New York, and...God, you know, I'm just gonna stop talking. 
 Now it means to ban someone, someone who's cheating. 
 You're 86'd. 
 Leave your chips and go. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, yeah, Megan, one more thing. 
 You see, the thing about card counters is, uh... sometimes they work... with a partner. 
 You're gonna be really upset when you meet my partner. 
 [Chatter] 
 [Thunk thunk thunk] 
 Aah! 
 I heard you never miss. 
 I don't. 
 [Groans] 
 Uhh! 
 Where's Walter Steele? 
 What? What a you talking about, huh? 
 6 months ago you had him kidnapped! 
 It was just a job. 
 I was given a name. 
 I didn't ask any questions. 
 Last chance. 
 Where is he? 
 Below ground. 
 You're lying! 
 I'm not. 
 I delivered him and they killed him. 
 I heard the gunshot. 
 He's dead. 
 Oh, let's see that blouse in that violet shade. 
 [Chuckles] You're a miracle worker, Thea. 
 Oh, when it comes to shopping, it's not work, really. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey. I'm teaching mom the joys of online clothes shopping. 
 Ollie? 
 Are you ok? 
 I need to talk to you both. 
 What is it? 
 It's about Walter. 
 Did the police contact you? 
 One of Mr. Diggle's army buddies works for the FBI now. 
 And they got news tonight. 
 No. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 There must be some mistake. 
 Who did Mr. Diggle talk to? 
 Did they find a body? 
 Mom... 
 Walter's gone. 
 No. This isn't right. 
 Where are you going? 
 Out. 
 I need some air. 
 It's 10:00 at night. 
 Mom, you're in shock. 
 Don't tell me what or how I feel, Oliver. 
 Why is she acting like that? 
 Come here. 
 [Crying] 
 I suspect I know what this is about. 
 You and I got in bed with Malcolm to cure what ails this city. 
 But I think you agree, killing thousands of people is not the answer. 
 Indeed. If we were to wage a war with Malcolm Merlyn, we will lose. 
 My family has already suffered enough. 
 And I have no desire to endanger mine. 
 Fortunately, there's another option. 
 6 months ago, Malcolm started buying up buildings in the Glades through an offshore company called Sagittarius. 
 And he made it sound as if this undertaking of his was a recent inspiration. 
 If you're right, he has been thinking about this for months. 
 If he can't rebuild it, he'll abandon the project. 
 How much of the Glades does he already have? 
 About a third. 
 Now, if we can quietly buy up the rest before he can, he won't be able to gain the control he needs. 
 We will need capital. 
 Do you still have your contacts in China? 
 I already have a flight planned for Shanghai tomorrow. 
 Come with me. 
 We shouldn't travel together. 
 Malcolm might get worried. 
 He already knows I have my doubts. 
 Besides, I'm getting the urge to take out the "Queen's Gambit" for another voyage. 
 Dad! Do you have any cash? 
 Jerk pizza guy can't break a 100. 
 Oliver, you remember Mr. Chen? 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Waiting. Thank you. 
 ♪ 1, 2, 3, 4, tell me... 
 Pizza. 
 [Song continues] 
 My hero. 
 I'm starved. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Ollie. 
 Where do you keep the bottle opener in this thing? 
 Bottom drawer. 
 Did you talk to Ray today? 
 About the ski trip? 
 No. He asked Jean to move in with him last night. 
 Oh. Guess they've been together forever. 
 We've been together longer. 
 Guess we have. 
 I only bring this up because your mom busted me yesterday. 
 And obviously we can't hang out at my house. 
 Why? Because your father threatened to tase me the last time that I closed the door to your bedroom? 
 So wouldn't it be nice to have a little place of our own? 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe. 
 This is a little fast, Laurel. 
 I know that you like to think of yourself as a bad boy, Oliver Queen, but... 
 I feel like we're ready to take the next step. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's do it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Mm. 
 [Song continues] 
 You lied to me. 
 We had a deal. 
 Gong dag. Gong-pa-ma-tsom. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You promised if I cooperated with the Undertaking, Walter wouldn't be harmed! 
 He hasn't been. 
 I'm a man of my word, Moira. 
 We both know better than that. 
 And I know... 
 I know you've had him killed. 
 [Beep] 
 Turn on the camera. 
 Oh, Walter... 
 Like you said, Moira, we have an agreement. 
 Walter would stay in my custody until the Undertaking was complete. 
 We're both in this together. 
 [Door unlocks] 
 [Whirring] 
 I've been sitting in the dark all night, too. 
 All these months I kept thinking if I could find a clue, I could get a lead on him. 
 Guess it wouldn't have mattered. 
 I can't imagine what your family's going through. 
 Walter's alive. 
 What? 
 But Alonzo said-- 
 I need you to pull up Malcolm Merlyn's phone records. 
 He made a call from his office to wherever Walter is being kept at 10:30 p.m. 
 Malcolm Merlyn? 
 Tommy's father? 
 Why would he kidnap Walter? 
 Felicity. 
 L.U.D. showed he made a call to a tenement complex located in Bludhaven. 
 Can you pull up a satellite view? 
 Ok. 
 That's a lot of security for low-income housing. 
 There's two guards stationed at all access points. 
 There's just one on the roof. 
 Exactly. There's no other buildings in that area. 
 If you want to get onto the roof, you're going to have to jump off of something. 
 I've got something. 
 There's a problem in quadrant 4. 
 Mr. Steele. 
 Walter. 
 What? 
 What's happening? 
 You're going home. 
 I thought I'd never see you again. 
 I'm all right. 
 Welcome home, Walter. 
 Thank you, son. 
 Thea. [Chuckles] 
 [Crying] 
 This is totally a family thing, isn't it? 
 I'm sorry, who are you? 
 This is Felicity. 
 She's my friend. 
 Mine, too. 
 It's good to see you. 
 You, too. 
 I'll let you guys get back to your hugging. 
 [Laughing and crying] 
 Oliver. 
 We're all together again. 
 Everything's gonna be all right. 
 Robert, I don't like the idea of this. 
 It's gonna be ok. 
 Yeah, well, how long will you be gone? 
 A few weeks. Maybe more, depending on what I-- 
 Why can't you just fly to China? 
 I think it's better the less you know. 
 I just hate that stupid boat. 
 Look at me. 
 I love you. 
 Everything's gonna be fine. 
 Ok. 
 Hey. 
 Got room for one more? 
 No. 
 Mom, let me keep dad company. 
 Oliver, you're in school. 
 Not really. 
 I tried to tell you that. 
 I could use an extra hand on the ship. 
 Robert... 
 Moira, let the kid take the boat out with the old man. 
 [Sighs] All right. 
 All right. 
 But you promise me that you'll behave yourself. 
 All right. I promise. 
 I love you so much. 
 I love you, too. 
 ♪ Everywhere you go I totally spaced. 
 I gotta call Tommy and let him know I'm out of town for a few weeks. 
 I'll see you on board in 5. 
 Sara? You here? 
 Yeah, you might want to circle around the block a few times, because your sister just showed up. 
 Hi. What are you doing here? 
 You're leaving for 3 weeks. 
 I wanted to come say bye to you in person. 
 I'm glad you did. 
 And... 
 I wanted to bring you something. 
 Oh. 
 In case you get lonely at sea. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Kisses] 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, is everything ok? 
 I mean, I didn't totally freak you out when I brought up the whole apartment thing earlier, did I? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 No. 
 Mm. 
 ♪ Every time you're leavin' ♪ 
♪ I keep cryin'... ♪ 
 But I do have to get back to the boat. 
 Yeah. 
 Is it done? 
 Yes. The bomb is in place. 
 And there's a storm front moving in along the "Gambit's" projected course. 
 Ok. 
 When the "Queen's Gambit" goes down, no one will suspect it's anything other than an act of God. 
 Oliver. 
 Ah. What a miracle. 
 How's Walter? 
 The police are saying that he was rescued by the Vigilante. 
 Yes, he was. 
 Has he said anything about his ordeal? 
 Was he able to identify any of his captors? 
 No. 
 Hmm. 
 That's too bad. 
 They'll get what's coming to them. 
 I'm just glad that my family is back together. 
 We all are. 
 Ollie. 
 Excuse me. 
 Is Walter ok? 
 I saw it on the news. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you ok? 
 Of course. 
 I promise you now is not the time. 
 It's you and Tommy. 
 You and me, actually. 
 I talked to Tommy yesterday, and the reason he broke up with me is because he thinks that you and I still belong together. 
 What did you say? 
 Nothing. 
 He walked out on me. 
 I just want you to be happy. 
 It's what I've always wanted. 
 Then will you please go talk to Tommy for me? 
 And say what? 
 Say that you and I are over. 
 That you're not still in love with me. 
 I can't do that. 
 Why not? 
 Because it wouldn't be true. 
 And I have enough lies in my life already. 
 [Knock on door] 
 I guess you do know where I live. 
 I've always known where you live. 
 May I? 
 I'm sorry. 
 You were right. 
 And I was wrong. 
 About Deadshot? 
 About everything. 
 About my mother and about her involvement in the Undertaking. 
 She lied to me. 
 To Thea. 
 She's working with Malcolm Merlyn. 
 They're planning something. 
 Something... 
 Terrible. 
 I don't know what yet.
