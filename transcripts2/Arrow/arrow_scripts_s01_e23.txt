 Previously on "Arrow"... 
 Maybe I'm finally ready to admit that I still have feelings for you, too. 
 No! Malcolm is planning to level the Glades! 
 My father, he told me that he failed the city, but I never knew what he meant until now. 
 Merlyn's plan is what I returned from the island to stop. 
 Oh, no! 
 You can survive this. 
 Make it home. 
 Make it better. 
 Right my wrongs. 
 [Gasping] Dad?! 
 Survive. 
 No! No! 
 [Gasping and groaning] 
 I hope I didn't hurt you. 
 At least I can properly thank you now for saving my life. 
 If I only knew how you were spending your nights... 
 My hope is that I can explain everything to you to help you understand. 
 You murdered my father! 
 You sentenced me to that island, to five years of hell. 
 I am truly sorry for what happened to you. 
 You know I have lost people. 
 Yeah, your wife. 
 Do you really think that you're honoring Tommy's mother by destroying the Glades? 
 As surely as you believe you're honoring your father with this hood. 
 Not a day goes by I don't miss your father. 
 You'll see him soon. 
 You can't beat me, Oliver. 
 Yes, you're younger. 
 You're faster, but you always seem to come up short against me. 
 Want to know why? 
 Because you don't know, in your heart, what you're fighting for. 
 What you're willing to sacrifice, and I do. 
 No one can stop what's about to come. 
 Not even the Vigilante. 
 The plane's holding steady at 33,000 feet. 
 That's the range for missile intercept, sir. 
 Lock missile one on target. 
 Missile one locked on the jet's heat trail. 
 Prepare to launch on my mark. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [All yelling and grunting] 
 Fire! Fire the missile now! 
 [Grunting] 
 I take back every joke I made about you sticking a tracking device in your boot. 
 
 Arrow 
Season 1 Episode 23 
 Sacrifice 
Original Air Date on May 15, 2013 
 
 Felicity's at Queen Consolidated. 
 She's still going through the data she pulled off Merlyn's network. 
 Did she find anything? 
 Yeah, the design schematics of the earthquake generator. 
 So we can shut it down. 
 Assuming we find it in time. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Yeah, Felicity, I got him. 
 Thank God. Is he ok? 
 Mostly. 
 Ok. 
 I'm on my way. 
 Miss Smoak. 
 Where are you off to in such a hurry? 
 Please. 
 Take a seat. 
 You know, I think I'd rather stand. 
 [Door slams] 
 You're not exactly a hardened criminal, are you? 
 No, I'm not any kind of criminal. 
 What do you call computer hacking? 
 A hobby? 
 That I do not engage in. 
 Hey, I got a whole mess of computer gobbedly gook that I don't understand, but it says otherwise. 
 I had my tech guys go through your computer at Queen Consolidated. 
 You used it to hack into blackhawk squad security to research arrows shipped to a company called Sagittarius and to analyze a water sample to tie back to a Vertigo drug lab. 
 These are all cases involving...The Hood. 
 Tell me, Felicity. 
 What am I thinking? 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Saved by the bell. 
 Excuse me. 
 [Ring] 
 Oliver, voice disguised : Hello, Detective. 
 It's funny you should call. 
 I got your trusty sidekick sitting right in front of me. 
 I don't have a sidekick. 
 When I need help, I call you. 
 Malcolm Merlyn plans to level the Glades with a manmade earthquake using technology from Unidac Industries. 
 What? 
 [Chuckles] Now you're just trying to have some fun with me. 
 I don't know what Merlyn's timetable is, so you need to evacuate the Glades immediately. 
 Get as many people to safety as you can. 
 Whatever you think of me, Detective, please...believe this. 
 Sounds like you have bigger problems than me. 
 Don't leave town. 
 You know... 
 I used to think the Vigilante was a criminal, too, but it seems to me, whoever he is, he's willing to sacrifice an awful lot to help the people of this city. 
 Kind of makes him a hero... 
 Doesn't it? 
 [Tommy chuckles] 
 Look who it is. 
 My best friend in life. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 I took your advice, you know. 
 I went to Laurel's, to fight for her. 
 So imagine my surprise seeing you there, kissing her. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, you're not. 
 Something's happening, and it involves your father. 
 Keep my father out of this. 
 Our fathers. 
 They aren't the men we thought they were. 
 They made a plan together... to destroy the Glades. 
 Do you have any idea what you sound like right now? 
 Your father's going to do it. 
 Because he thinks it will avenge your mother's death. 
 Do not talk about my mother! 
 The difference between us, Tommy, is that I didn't find out the truth about my father until it was too late. 
 But you've always known, deep down, you have always known the man he is. 
 I wish you would have died on that island. 
 [All yelling] 
 We need to reprogram the missile. 
 I don't know how to reprogram a missile launcher! 
 I do. 
 Watch out! 
 Oliver, put the chip in. 
 Make it quick, I got a comm stat meeting in five. 
 I don't want to be late for my own funeral. 
 I've got it under good authority that Malcolm Merlyn is planning on leveling the Glades using some kind of earthquake device made by Unidac Industries. 
 Who's your source in all this? 
 [Sighs] The Vigilante. 
 He called me. 
 Has been for the last few months, he's been helpful on some cases. 
 You asked for the task force to catch him. 
 You swore to me you'd bring him in. 
 I know. 
 I swore to uphold the law, because the law is steady, the law is unchanging, the law needed to be protected. 
 But what are laws, rules, if they don't protect people? 
 Now listen, I know, I'm throwing away my career by telling you this, but I am willing to sacrifice catching this guy if it means saving people's lives! 
 Please. 
 You're suspended. 
 Leave the gun and your badge with the duty sergeant. 
 Lieutenant... 
 Suspension or incarceration. 
 You choose. 
 No more lies, Mom. 
 The Undertaking. 
 We need to stop it. 
 Everything I have ever said or done has been to protect you and your sister. 
 What about all those people in the Glades? 
 I'm not their mother. 
 I spoke to Malcolm. 
 You what?! 
 He could have killed you. 
 He killed your father. 
 No, he didn't. 
 After the "Gambit" went down, dad and I both made it to the life raft. 
 And then we drifted, for days. 
 In the end, there wasn't enough food and water for both of us. 
 [Sighs] 
 So he shot himself in the head. 
 I don't want to hear this. 
 He sacrificed himself... 
 So that I could live. 
 Do you really think that I could go on living knowing that you sacrificed thousands more in my name? 
 Mom. 
 Please. 
 You have to help me stop Malcolm. 
 We need to know where the device is. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Ring] 
 [Ring] 
 Malcolm. 
 How can I help you? 
 I see. 
 Yes, thank you for calling. 
 What is it? 
 Malcolm's accelerated his timetable. 
 The Undertaking is... 
 Is happening tonight. 
 Where you going? 
 Somebody in this family needs to put an end to this. 
 Whatever the cost. 
 Laurel : Hi. 
 Hey. 
 I woke up and you were gone. 
 I'm really sorry about that. 
 Oliver, I'm trying not to think that our history's repeating; That you're scared again. 
 No. 
 That's not it. 
 Then will you tell me what's going on with you? 
 There are so many things that I have wanted to tell you for so long. 
 I never told you what happened to me on the island. 
 You didn't have to. 
 I can see that it changed you. 
 That's the thing. 
 Laurel, it didn't. 
 Those five years didn't change me. 
 They just... 
 They scraped away all the things that I wasn't, and revealed the person I always was, which is the person... 
 That's who you always saw. 
 I don't know how you saw it, but you did. 
 Nobody in my life is who I thought they were... 
 Except you. 
 Laurel, I need you to do something for me. 
 Stay out of the Glades tonight. 
 Why? 
 You'll know soon. 
 One way or the other. 
 I have to go. 
 It's over. 
 Laurel and me, I mean. 
 She's with Oliver, again. Always. 
 I'm sorry, Son. 
 Yeah, and he said you wanted to nuke the Glades or something. 
 You know, it's funny, scotch doesn't make it any more believable. 
 Maybe after your jihad, we can grab some steaks. 
 It's true, Tommy. 
 It's the reason I closed your mother's clinic. 
 I didn't want to see it leveled. 
 What? 
 I have something I'd like you to listen to. 
 The night your mother died, she called me. 
 I awoke to a voicemail from her. 
 Dad... 
 Her final gift to me. 
 Rebecca : Malcolm, I'm in trouble. 
 I told--I told him to take everything. 
 My money...my ring. 
 Turn it off. 
 They shot me. 
 I screamed for help, but no one would come. 
 No one would come. 
 Malcolm, I don't want to die alone. 
 She bled out into the pavement while people passed, did nothing. 
 [Rebecca crying] 
 Your mother built her clinic in the Glades because she wanted to save this city. 
 It can't be saved. 
 Because the people there don't want it to be saved. 
 So you kill them all-- 
 Yes! 
 They deserve to die! 
 All of them! 
 The way she died. 
 The Undertaking is happening tonight. 
 Oliver, Felicity may have found something. 
 This symbol is a map of the old subway tunnel system. 
 That's what got us thinking the Undertaking is connected to the Glades. 
 What if it's more specific than that? 
 What do you mean? 
 If I had a machine that could trigger an earthquake in an otherwise geologically stable area, where would I position it? 
 Underground. 
 Yeah. 
 This is a U.S. geological survey of the tectonic plates running underneath Starling City. 
 This red line here is a known fault that runs right below the Glades. 
 About a mile, the fault runs underneath the old Tenth Street subway line. 
 Dollars to donuts, the seismic device is somewhere along there. 
 I know where it is. 
 [Cell phone buzzes] 
 Now is not a good time. 
 Yeah, understate much? 
 Mom has a whole bunch of reporters here. 
 She's holding a press conference or something. 
 What channel? 
 Ah, it looks like all of them. 
 Felicity, pull up the local news, please. 
 My name is Moira Dearden Queen. 
 I am the acting CEO of Queen Consolidated. 
 And God forgive me, I have failed the city. 
 For the past five years, under the threat for my life and the lives of my family... 
 I have been complicit in an undertaking with one horrible purpose-- to destroy the Glades and everyone in it. 
 I realize now that my family's safety will mean nothing if I let this dreadful act occur. 
 But you need to know that the architect of this nightmare... is Malcolm Merlyn. 
 No! 
 Yes, and I have proof that he has killed dozens in pursuit of this madness. 
 Adam Hunt, Frank Chen, and my husband... 
 Robert. 
 Please. 
 If you reside in the Glades, you need to get out now. 
 Your lives and the lives of your children depend on it. 
 Please. 
 [Reporters all talking at once] 
 I don't understand. I'm sorry.  
 I love you. 
 I love Roy. 
 Roy? 
 He lives in the Glades. 
 I can't leave him there. 
 Sweetheart--Thea! 
 Moira Queen, you're under arrest for conspiracy. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
 You have the right to an attorney. 
 
 
 
 Tommy : Is it true? 
 Did you kill all those people? 
 I did what I had to do. 
 [Gasping] 
 Freeze! 
 Malcolm Merlyn, you are under arrest. 
 Dad, no! 
 Please, Dad. 
 Stay back. 
 I don't want to hurt you. 
 You can't. 
 And you can't stop me. 
 Oliver, I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 She gave those people a chance. 
 I thought Merlyn broke your bow. 
 I have another. 
 I was going over the device schematics. 
 The device can be set for a timed detonation or can be remote activated by a mobile transmitter. 
 Something Merlyn could have on him. 
 Listen, Oliver, if we can just get our hands on this transmitter, maybe we don't need to track down the device. 
 It's too big of an "if," Diggle. 
 I need you in the subway. 
 Find the device, disarm it. 
 So you can take on Merlyn by yourself? 
 I have to. 
 Oh, he'll kill you, Oliver. 
 I know. 
 He's beaten me twice. 
 And I don't know how to stop him. 
 Ok. Well, how about this time, you bring along something you didn't have the last time you two fought-- 
 Me. 
 I can't let you. 
 I can't let you do this by yourself, man. 
 Oliver, you are not alone, not since you brought me into this. 
 Us into this. 
 Besides, army regulations-- a soldier never lets a brother go into battle alone. 
 I'm out of bows. 
 I got my gun. 
 I guess it's up to me to do the dismantling. 
 This whole area is ground zero. 
 I want you out of here. 
 If you're not leaving, I'm not leaving. 
 Besides, if I don't deactivate the device, who will? 
 You were right. 
 I need one more thing from you. 
 Yeah? What do I got left to give? 
 I know where Merlyn is keeping the device. 
 It's in an abandoned subway station near Puckett Street. 
 How do you know? 
 That's where his wife was murdered. 
 I need someone I can trust to deactivate the device. 
 We have a mutual friend that I think could... 
 Talk you through it. 
 She says you care about the people of this city, that it needs you. 
 Right now, Detective... 
 It needs you. 
 [Exhales] 
 [All shouting] 
 Man : Earlier today, Moira Queen, CEO of Queen Consolidated, admitted to a conspiracy to destroy the Glades. 
 Everyone within a five mile radius is asked to evacuate. 
 [Horn honking] 
 Please leave the area immediately. 
 Evacuation centers have been set up in Starling City. 
 [All shouting] 
 [Siren] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Looks like we missed him. 
 Shado! 
 Slade! 
 [Slade laughs] 
 Boy, I should have figured. 
 You couldn't save the day... without making a mess. 
 Where's Shado? 
 I thought she was with you. 
 Fyers : Actually... 
 She's with me. 
 Let her go! 
 It's over, Fyers! 
 Let her go. 
 Amazing. 
 A two year operation undone because a young playboy happened to wash up on the shore, and now here you are-- a killer. 
 [Chuckles] You wanted nothing more than to leave this island, and now you can. 
 I can call in a rescue ship, you can go home. 
 Tell me, Mr. Queen. 
 Are you prepared to sacrifice your freedom... 
 For her? 
 [Groaning] 
 Guess so. 
 [Tommy groans] 
 Tommy. 
 Tommy. Tommy! 
 Oliver. 
 Where's your father? 
 Ohh. I don't know. 
 You were right. 
 You were right about him. 
 Diggle : Oliver. 
 Are you going to kill him? 
 Get to safety. 
 Looks like a false wall. 
 Welcome, gentlemen. 
 I've been waiting for you. 
 I wanted to see you watch your city die. 
 Where's the transmitter? 
 Somewhere I can easily get to it. 
 I doubt it. 
 You'll be too dead. 
 Aaah! 
 [Groaning] 
 Stairs. Go, go. 
 [Groaning] 
 So tell me-- are you ready to die? 
 Felicity : You found it yet, Detective? 
 Not exactly sure what I'm looking for. 
 Do you want me to describe it to you? 
 No, I've got it. 
 Felicity : You should see something that looks like a circuit board. 
 Pull it out. 
 Do you see a timer? 
 Seven minutes. 
 Ok. Well, the good news is, this is going to be a paperweight in three. 
 [All shouting] 
 What do you got there, grandpa? 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Back off! 
 Learn how to count, jerkwad. 
 There's three of us. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 'Cause I only count one. 
 With a gun. 
 Where did you learn how to do that? 
 I guess I have wicked aim. 
 What? 
 I went to your house. 
 Yeah, I figured I'd run for my life with everyone else. 
 Did you--did you come to rescue me? 
 Yeah. 
 Come on. 
 There are three wires-- you need a green one, a yellow and one blue. 
 Cut the blue. 
 All right, I got it, I got it. 
 [Beeping and whirring] 
 Oh, my God. 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 There must be some sort of anti-tamper safeguard. 
 Hold on. I'm going to try to figure out how to override it. 
 Not enough time. 
 There's not enough time! 
 Just hold on! 
 Not enough time. 
 Laurel. 
 Dad, don't worry, I got your message, and I did not come into work today. 
 Save it, kiddo, we both know you're there. 
 But listen--you got to get out of the Glades. 
 You got to get out of the Glades right now! Ok, please. 
 Dad? 
 Right now, Laurel! 
 Right now, Laurel! 
 Daddy, you're scaring me. 
 Sorry, but I'm not... 
 I'm not going to make it. 
 What? 
 What?! 
 You have to promise me one thing, Laurel. 
 You're not going to die along with me. 
 You have to go on with your life. 
 After your sister died, I pushed people away, I became like a ghost. 
 I didn't think I had the right to live when my baby girl didn't. 
 Promise me you're not going to make the same mistakes as I did. 
 Where are you? 
 Promise me, Laurel. 
 Promise me. 
 I promise. 
 I love you, honey, now and forever. 
 I love you. 
 Dad! 
 Detective Lance? 
 I need you to listen to me very carefully. 
 You do know how dangerous it is to text and drive, right? It can wait! 
 No, it can't. I'm trying to find us another route out of here. 
 Let me. It's not worth the risk. 
 Roy! 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Roy! 
 Help me out! Help me out! 
 Help me out! 
 Roy, stop! Roy! 
 The device is about to go off any second! 
 [All shouting] 
 I can't leave anyone behind. 
 I know you think you have something to prove. 
 But you're not the Vigilante! 
 I can't do this unless I know you're safe. 
 Then you better haul ass out of it. 
 [Both grunting] 
 Don't struggle. 
 It's over. 
 There was never any doubt in the outcome. 
 Don't worry. Your mother and sister will be joining you in death. 
 Robert : Survive. 
 [Groaning] 
 Thank you for teaching me what I'm fighting for. 
 But my father taught me how. 
 [Beeping] 
 Come on! 
 Felicity : Oliver, Lance did it. 
 It's over. 
 If I've learned anything as a successful businessman, it's...[Coughs] 
 Redundancy. 
 Felicity... there's another device. 
 There's two of them! 
 What the hell's happening?! 
 Ok, that's enough. 
 Ohh! 
 [Explosions] 
 I turned the damn thing off! 
 Merlyn had a second device! 
 My daughter! Laurel! 
 She's at CNRI! 
 Run! 
 Laurel! 
 Oliver? 
 Are you ok? 
 Yeah. 
 [Gasps] 
 The damage seems to be contained on the east side, past Wells Street. 
 Laurel. 
 Are you going to be ok? 
 Go, go, go. 
 [Sobbing] Help! 
 Please! Help me! 
 [Sobbing] Tommy! 
 What are you doing here? 
 I kind of figured that you might come back to CNRI. 
 [Grunting] 
 You came here for me? 
 I love you. 
 [Grunting] 
 Get up! Go! 
 I'm right behind you! 
 Laurel! Laurel! 
 Dad! Dad! 
 Oh, thank God. 
 No! 
 No! Laurel! 
 No, you can't! 
 Tommy! 
 You can't! 
 It's too late, it's too late. 
 Laurel : Tommy! 
 Ah, Tommy. 
 You're going to be fine. 
 Another thing... 
 We got to disagree on. 
 Tommy... 
 Is--is Laurel safe? Is Laurel safe? 
 I tried to get her out of here. 
 Yeah, yeah, you did. 
 You saved her. 
 I'm going to get you out of here. 
 You're going to be fine. 
 Stop. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No. Don't apologize. 
 I was angry. 
 And I was jealous. I-- 
 I am my father. 
 No. 
 No, you're not. 
 Did--did you kill him? 
 No. 
 Thank you. 
 No, no! 
 Tommy! 
 It should have been me. 
 Open your eyes, Tommy! 
 Open your eyes.
