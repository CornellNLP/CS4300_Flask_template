 My name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal-- survive. 
 Oliver Queen is alive. 
 Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish-- to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 
 Previously on "Arrow"... 
 Mom? 
 It's about Sara. 
 What about her? 
 I think she may be alive. 
 [Voice disguised] I'm not here to hurt you or your father. 
 Why should I trust you?! 
 [Regular voice] 
 Because you always have. 
 This is my daughter, Helena. 
 When her father killed her fiancé, she changed into something dark and twisted. 
 I have been alone in my hate for so long. 
 What is this? 
 Payback. 
 The police have him in custody. 
 He's going to jail and then onto prison. 
 I'm not going to stop. 
 [Crowd cheering, dance music playing] 
 Hey, mister. 
 You feel like a dance? 
 Absolutely. 
 Tonight your first night? 
 First, and last. 
 Gus. 
 [Grunts] 
 Helena! 
 I'm looking for my father. 
 I figure if anybody knows where he is, it'd be his attorney. 
 I don't. 
 [Groans] 
 Ohh! Helena, I swear... 
 I'd tell you where the FBI's keeping Frank, but after your father and I made his plea deal to testify, the Feds, they stopped telling me anything. 
 Please. 
 You have to believe me. 
 I do. 
 Hey, Gus, song's over, man. You still in there? 
 [Motorcycle revving] 
 
 Arrow 
Season 1 Episode 17 
 The Huntress Returns 
Original Air Date on march 20, 2013 
 
 Oh, my gosh! 
 It looks amazing! 
 Yeah. 
 Steve Aoki's going to deejay. 
 Right there. 
 What? How did you get Steve Aoki? 
 I dated his sister. 
 Oh. 
 A million years ago, a million years ago. 
 Ok. [Chuckles] 
 So, will you be my date tomorrow night? 
 Is a club opening a proper date? 
 I certainly hope so. 
 Is that a "yes?" 
 No. 
 That's a "yes." 
 Laurel. 
 I'm glad you called. 
 Too much... 
 It's too long for us to go without talking. 
 Dad, I have to tell you-- 
 No, no, listen, before you say anything, I got to apologize. 
 I should never have used you to catch the archer, and I'm sorry. 
 Laurel, I'm just-- 
 I'm sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 I owe you an apology, too. 
 For what? 
 Hello, Quentin. 
 How are you? 
 You look well. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Why--why are you here? 
 I'm here because I believe Sara's still alive. 
 What?! 
 Dad. Sit-- 
 What is going on? 
 Just hear mom out. 
 Sit. 
 What's going on? 
 Start from the beginning. 
 Oliver was found on an island called Lian Yu in the North China Sea. 
 There are hundreds; Thousands of deserted islands in this chain. 
 What if Sara had survived, too? 
 And nobody would know if she'd washed up in any one of those. 
 So you don't actually have any proof that she's alive? 
 I have proof. 
 A tourist took this. 
 Could be anybody. 
 Doesn't it look just like Sara? 
 Our daughter's a survivor, Quentin. 
 Ah, you have some nerve. 
 Three years, no phone calls, no emails, nothing. 
 You just show up with an old photo-- 
 Dad, please. 
 No. 
 Please, you listen to me, ok? 
 Sara died on that boat. 
 Why-- why are you making me re-live this? 
 I'm not doing this. 
 [Sighs] 
 Dad... 
 No. 
 So I told Chris and Shane they could be our plus ones tonight to Oliver's club-- if they're lucky. 
 We both have plus ones, right? 
 Uh, I-I don't know. 
 Hang on just a second. 
 I didn't know purse snatchers took coffee breaks. 
 You know, for a stuck up, rich bitch, you seem to spend a lot of time here in the Glades. 
 My job's around here. 
 You? Have a job? 
 Yeah. 
 You know, you should try it some time. 
 Instead of hanging out on a street corner, waiting to boost somebody's handbag. 
 Sounds good. 
 Know anyone who's hiring high school dropouts with a couple of priors, no references and a history of violence? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Actually, I might. 
 You know that new club opening in the Glades? 
 Verdant? My brother owns it. 
 I think he might be hiring valet attendants. 
 Do you think it's a good idea? 
 Me, taking the keys to stranger's cars? 
 I think it's time you put up or shut up. 
 Talk to your brother. 
 Oliver : Yo. 
 Hey. 
 Where you been? 
 Oh, I thought I'd give myself a rare morning in. 
 Don't look at me like that. 
 The club is opening, finally. 
 McKenna and I are going on date number six tonight, which is... 
 It's significant. 
 And, uh, I don't know. 
 It seemed like a good day to give the bad guys a rest. 
 Well, it's the bad girls that I'm worried about. 
 Helena. 
 Yes, or as I like to call her, your psycho ex-girlfriend. 
 This was taken at Alley Cats, the strip joint. 
 The police report lists the stiff's name as Gus Sabatoni. 
 That's Bertinelli's lawyer. 
 Why would she come back to Starling City just for him? 
 It's not like he did a good job. 
 Her father's serving consecutive life sentences without parole. 
 Come on, Oliver, we both knew this was just a matter of time. 
 You tried to help her, you couldn't. 
 Now the only question is, how long before she drops the dime on you, me, this whole operation. 
 Ok. I want you to get in touch with the contacts in the Bratva. 
 Talk to anyone on the street, figure out where Helena is, why she's back. 
 Ok. But Oliver-- 
 Dig, if she's here, she's here for a reason. 
 If that's not Frank Bertinelli, we need to know what she has planned. 
 Ok. 
 [Indistinct chatter and laughter] 
 Speedy? 
 Thea : Oh, we're in here. 
 Look who's back. 
 She was just telling me about your guys' first date-- at Russo's. 
 Hello, Oliver. 
 Oh, Ollie, I kind of have this pseudo friend that's looking for a job. 
 I was wondering if the club's still hiring? 
 Yes. Of course. 
 Talk to Tommy. 
 As a matter of fact, you can go upstairs and call Tommy, right now. 
 Great. 
 You rock. 
 Where you been? 
 Um... 
 Barcelona. 
 Monaco, Budapest. 
 I just needed to forget who I was. 
 And how much I missed you. 
 Do you mean like you missed Gus Sabatoni? 
 I thought you were done with your father's organization, Helena. 
 Because he's serving consecutive life sentences in Iron Heights prison. 
 You got your revenge. 
 He just cut a deal with the Justice Department to testify against the East Coast family. 
 In 48 hours, Witness Protection will give him a new name, a new life, and he'll be off the grid forever-- untraceable! 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 My father doesn't deserve a second chance-- a second life. 
 And I can't. 
 I can't take on a phalanx of U.S. marshals. 
 Not without help. 
 No. 
 It's murder. 
 It's not justice. 
 Oh, there you are. 
 I have a question about your opening tonight. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Oliver, who's your friend? 
 Oh! Mom, this is Helena. 
 Helena, this is my mother. 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. 
 Helena was just leaving. 
 Yes. I have a family engagement. 
 Excuse us for a minute. 
 Of course. 
 I guess I will just have to be more persuasive. 
 Fortunately... 
 You have a family, too. 
 She was in my house. 
 She made a not so veiled threat. 
 I want extra security around my mother and sister. 
 Way ahead of you, man. 
 Thank you. 
 It's my job. 
 For not saying, "I told you so." 
 Night's young. 
 Where you been? 
 The club opens in four hours. 
 I've been dealing with the vendors. 
 No, you haven't. Tommy... 
 We need to talk. 
 I'm sorry, all right. 
 But I kept this a secret to protect the people that are closest to me. 
 Do you think that's what I care about? 
 What, that my feelings are hurt? 
 You're a murderer. 
 A killer. 
 You were my best friend in life, but now it's like I don't even know you. 
 You're right. 
 I've changed. 
 Listen, buddy, now I can explain to you. 
 I can explain to you how and why-- 
 What'd be the point? 
 I wouldn't believe a word of it, anyway. 
 One of those missiles has an effective range of up to 2,400 kilometers. 
 We're not going anywhere until we figure out what Fyers is planning. 
 Wild guess? He's planning on blowing something up. 
 Well, one of those could do the job. 
 But this? 
 This is about starting a war. 
 With who? 
 What does it matter? 
 We have to stop Fyers before he kills thousands of innocent people. 
 There are tons of soldiers down there. 
 Even if we get through all of them, we can't just steal a whole missile launcher. 
 Well, who said anything about stealing it? 
 So what's the plan? 
 Ambush? 
 It's impossible. 
 We can't take out all six without one radioing for back up. 
 It'd be good if we could get all the soldiers in one place. 
 You're right. 
 What'd the stapler ever do to you? 
 What is it, Laurel? I'm busy. 
 The Hood's girlfriend is back. 
 Dad, I'm sorry about this morning. 
 But if I told you the real reason to come see me, you wouldn't have shown up. 
 You're damn right I wouldn't. 
 So you really believe this garbage your mother's selling about Sara being alive on fantasy island? 
 [Exhales] 
 I mean, no. 
 But what would it hurt to take a look at everything that mom found? 
 Even if it's just to set her straight. 
 Laurel, you know how long it's taken for me to get to a place where Sara isn't the first thing I think about every morning? 
 Dad... 
 [Exhales] 
 Tell your mom I'm not making any promises. 
 [Dance music playing] 
 ♪ Die ♪ 
♪ die To Verdant. ♪ 
 I know I haven't always been supportive of this venture, but I have to admit this nightclub is quite an accomplishment. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 Your father would be, too. 
 Yeah, congratulations, Ollie. The club doesn't totally suck. 
 Thanks, Speedy. 
 Thank you very much, all of you, for coming. 
 ♪ And blue skies ♪ to embrace a love unknown Oh! There you are. 
 This place is amazing. 
 I'm so proud of you and Ollie. 
 Thanks. 
 Is everything ok? 
 I'm great. 
 Well, breakfast was a disaster. 
 Breakfast? 
 With my parents? 
 Right. That was this morning. 
 Uh... 
 Sorry. 
 Are you sure everything's ok? 
 Because you seem completely off. 
 I'm fine. 
 I promise. 
 Tommy! Tommy. 
 Did you call Roy yet? 
 I left him a message. 
 He starts tomorrow. 
 Which reminds me, I have to go check in with the office. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey, Tommy. 
 Remember me? 
 [Dance music playing] 
 Sorry to bother you, Mr. Queen. 
 Your timing is perfect. 
 I can't dance. 
 They said it was urgent. 
 You ok? 
 Yeah. We ran out of Cristal. 
 Oh. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Ok. 
 Dig? 
 Let him go. 
 He has nothing to do with this. 
 I told you. 
 Oliver, I warned you. 
 Helena! This isn't you. 
 My father is a mobster and a murderer. 
 It is not like you haven't killed men like that before! 
 And I tried to teach you to obtain your objective without killing! 
 By applying leverage. 
 By exploiting someone's weakness. 
 [Tommy screaming and gasping] 
 There is a whole club full of leverage above our heads right now. 
 Please. 
 Oliver, don't make me do something that both of us will regret. 
 Ok! Ok. You win. 
 I'll help you. 
 Let him go. 
 Let...Him...Go! 
 [Tommy groaning and gasping] 
 Don't say it. 
 Ok. 
 Then let's talk about Helena. 
 Oliver, if you didn't still have feelings for this girl, you would have thought of a different solution than letting her extort you into killing someone. 
 So what do you want me to do? 
 You want me to kill her? 
 I think you would have a long time ago if she looked like me instead of the T-Mobile girl. 
 She's a stone cold killer, Oliver. 
 She's not evil. 
 She's been lost since her father killed her fiancé in cold blood. 
 And are you going to sit there and tell me that you don't know what it's like to want revenge? 
 What would you do? Hmm? 
 If Floyd Lawton was standing right there? 
 Nothing that will involve blackmailing you into hunting him down. 
 You're right. 
 Ok? I can't kill her. 
 And I can't take her to the police and risk her exposing all of this. 
 But at least, if I'm involved, I can contain her, all right? 
 I can minimize the collateral damage. 
 Sorry, am I... interrupting something? 
 We were just... talking about you. 
 And here I thought you didn't care much for me. 
 Still don't. 
 I haven't been able to locate the safe house where the FBI is keeping your father. 
 I can help with that. 
 I've been dying to hack into the FBI security system. 
 Get out. Get out. 
 This is a private thing, Felicity. Please. 
 Oh. Ok. 
 See ya, I guess... 
 How many girlfriends do you have, exactly? 
 Like I said... 
 
 
 
 We don't know where the safe house is. 
 What we do know is that the Marshall service is taking your father to a hearing at the Justice Department tonight. 
 There's a problem...Helena. 
 There are two vans. 
 And one of them's a decoy. 
 Well, it's a good thing there's two of us, then. 
 It's not too late to call this off. 
 I think you know me better than that. 
 I don't take prisoners. 
 Hey! 
 I found an intruder while I was circling the perimeter. 
 It's Wilson. 
 You killed a few of my friends, you son of a bitch. 
 And I'm going to kill a few more. 
 I'll talk to one of our lawyers and have them call you right back. 
 Cut yourself shaving? 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 You got a minute? 
 Sure. 
 How was Roy's first day? 
 Kid never showed. 
 Um... 
 I just, uh, I came by to apologize for last night. 
 Instead of an apology, why don't you try the truth? 
 You can start with your wrist. 
 I got into a fight with a blender at the club. 
 It was stupid. [Chuckles] 
 I thought I asked for the truth. 
 I know something's up. 
 Why won't you tell me what's going on? 
 Because I can't. 
 Why not? 
 I can't tell you that, either. 
 I wish that I could. 
 Laurel, I'm sorry. 
 So am I. 
 I really need you right now, Tommy. 
 My mother shows up saying my dead sister is still alive, and my father is furious with me that I'm even listening to her. 
 And I don't know who to believe. 
 I feel like I'm falling apart. 
 I'm still here for you. 
 No. 
 You're not. 
 You're a million miles away, and the worst part is, I don't even know why. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Wow. Stalker much? 
 You didn't show up for the job I got you. 
 Yeah, I had second thoughts about parking your brother's Bentley. 
 What, being a valet is beneath you? 
 No, but accepting charity from some rich girl is. 
 Why are you so obsessed with the fact that I have money? 
 You know, money isn't everything. 
 [Scoffs] Spoken like someone who's got it. 
 Now, uh, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my life of crime. 
 [Exhales] 
 Yo, can you help me out? 
 Think I'm lost. 
 Where's downtown at? 
 I--I--I don't know. 
 Maybe you can give us some directions. 
 Or better yet, some money-- 
 [Thea yelling] 
 [Groaning] You ok? 
 You're bleeding! 
 Yeah, that's what happens when you get stabbed. 
 [Gasping] Ahh. 
 Just your father. 
 Anyone else gets hurt and I'll put an arrow in you. 
 That's sweet. 
 Now I know how you charmed your cop girlfriend. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Sirens] 
 [Horns honking] 
 Give me Frank Bertinelli. 
 [Doors open] 
 [Siren] 
 Your father's not in the van. 
 But he sends his regards. 
 Where's the Hood? 
 Helena Bertinelli... 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Damn it. 
 Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. 
 You have the right to an attorney. 
 Paul Copani, Nick Salvati, Gus Sabatoni. 
 You are quite the hunter, Ms. Bertinelli. 
 Well, I guess I should make that "Huntress." 
 You've been systemically taking down everyone in your father's criminal organization. 
 When Gus Sabatoni turned up dead, we knew it was just a matter of time before you tried to murder your old man. 
 [Chuckles] Do you want to tell us why? 
 Not particularly. 
 You should reconsider. 
 We got you, but the vigilante got away before E.S.U. could move on him. 
 You know who he is. 
 Who he really is. 
 Don't you? 
 [Laughs] 
 Ms. Bertinelli, you're going away for all day, we can't change that. 
 But things can be better. 
 Or they could be worse. 
 You tell me his name, I will do everything I can to make it better. 
 Oliver Queen. 
 You're dating him now, right? 
 I saw you at the opening of his club last night. 
 Did he mention that we used to be lovers? 
 We want to know about the Hood, not Oliver Queen. 
 Let me let you in on a little secret-- it's not going to work out between you two. 
 You see, Oliver has a particular talent. 
 He uses people. 
 He used me, he used the detective here's daughter-- excuse me--daughters. 
 I would get out of it before you get yourself hurt. 
 [Lance slaps table] 
 Last chance. 
 His name. 
 The Hood. 
 [Electricity flickering, alarm sounding] 
 What's going on? 
 I don't know. 
 Go, get out of here! 
 Head for a door. 
 Freeze! 
 Sounds like quite the daring rescue. 
 You're very lucky to have a friend like Roy, Thea. 
 Oh, don't I know it. 
 We're not friends. 
 Well, let me get you stitched up, and then you two can decide what you are or aren't. 
 You are such a jerk. 
 Roy. 
 What's the matter? 
 [Gasping] 
 Nothing. 
 I just don't see why I need a shot. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, don't tell me a tough gang banger like yourself is afraid of a tiny little needle. 
 It doesn't look so tiny. 
 Well, just think about something else. 
 Besides the needle. 
 Like what? 
 Ok, now this could sting a little. 
 Done. 
 Now that wasn't so bad, was it? 
 Thanks for the save. 
 I couldn't risk you telling the police about me. 
 Is that the only reason? 
 Why can't you just admit... 
 That you still have feelings for me, too? 
 What is it? 
 A plane ticket to Rome, and a passport so you can start a new life somewhere else. 
 The police know you're tracking your father, Helena. 
 You'll never find him. 
 So get out of my city. 
 [Slade breathing heavily] 
 Place these around the launcher. 
 Do it quickly. Their backup will be arriving any second. 
 Man on radio : We're 60 seconds out from the launcher. 
 Set your final charges and we'll blow it. 
 I think I have a better idea. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm taking the circuit board. 
 Computers won't work without them, and neither will this. 
 [Chuckles] Leverage. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should have called. 
 No, it's--it's ok. 
 Come on in. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm surprised, but I'm happy. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Everything ok? 
 I had a really rough night. 
 I just wasn't anticipating, with my work and the club, I feel like I'm letting everybody down. 
 My family and Tommy and... 
 You. I feel like I'm letting you down. 
 You're being too hard on yourself. 
 We both have demanding jobs. 
 That's no excuse for hurting the people closest to you. 
 No, but when you believe in what you do, you find a way to make it work. 
 How? 
 Well... 
 The first thing you do is you find yourself someone you never have to apologize to.

 Hey, it's me. 
 I was multitasking, and intercepted a police report. 
 A local sporting goods store just got robbed of one high powered crossbow. 
 Now... 
 Could be a crazy coincidence or your psycho ex-girlfriend-- 
 Dig's words, not mine-- is still in town. 
 I'll let you know if I learn anything more. 
 In the meantime, just...watch your back. 
 Hi. 
 I don't think we had a chance to be properly introduced this morning. 
 Felicity? 
 Oliver. 
 Felicity : Oliver... 
 I'm here. 
 You ok? 
 Hey, hey. 
 You ok? 
 I got your call. 
 What happened? 
 Helena. 
 She wanted the address to the safe house where her father's being kept. 
 She made me hack the FBI database. 
 Sorry, Oliver. 
 Hey. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Oliver, what are you going to do? 
 What I should have done in the first place. 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 Ahh! 
 Helena! 
 Code three, shots fired at the Bertinelli safe house. 
 This is Hall. 
 I'm on-site. 
 Lance on radio : Wait for back-up, Detective. 
 That's an order. 
 You won't shoot me. 
 You're not a murderer. 
 Remember? 
 But you are. 
 And if I let you go, that blood will be on my hands. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Exhales] 
 I practiced that move. 
 I had a feeling I might need it someday. 
 You would have killed me. 
 [Both grunting] 
 Enough! 
 Freeze! 
 Put it down. 
 Turn around. 
 Slowly. 
 No! 
 McKenna? 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How you feeling? 
 Uh, numb. 
 Hey, don't-- don't move. 
 Ok. 
 I met your doctor. 
 He's a nice guy. 
 Hmm. 
 He says you're lucky to be alive. 
 Yeah. He also said I have a shattered femur, and it's going to take at least a year to rehab. 
 I loved being a cop. 
 Oh, come on. 
 McKenna. 
 You're still a cop. 
 You have one more surgery, go home-- 
 I'm not going home. 
 What? 
 I'm moving to Coast City to live with my sister. 
 They have the best physical therapy facility in the country there. 
 I'll visit. 
 Hey, I'm a billionaire, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll move to Coast City. 
 [Chuckles] That's very sweet, but... 
 Your club just opened. 
 And your work is here. 
 Don't worry about me. 
 It's my responsibility to worry about you. 
 Just stop, ok? 
 Listen, you know how I feel about you. 
 Please don't make this harder than it already is. 
 Ok. 
 Ok. 
 It's, uh, it's whatever you need. 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you cleaning out your desk? 
 No. A friend's. 
 Um... 
 You asked to see me. 
 Why don't you take a seat. 
 Ok. 
 I'm ready to listen now. 
 Thank you. 
 Tommy : Hey. 
 I, uh, heard about McKenna. 
 You ok? 
 Not really. 
 Look, I know that I have been a jerk lately. 
 I just couldn't understand how you could keep such a huge secret from me. 
 But I-- 
 I never considered the toll it must take on you. 
 Lying to the people that are closest to me. 
 It's the hardest part. 
 I get that. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 I was wrong... to think that I could have it both ways; that I could do what I do and still have a normal life. 
 With anyone. 
 Except if you're alone, you're never going to be happy. 
 Maybe not. 
 But me being happy isn't what's important right now. 
 Your plan, your call. 
 Fyers. 
 Mr. Queen. 
 I thought I might be hearing from you. 
 We have the circuit board. 
 You're making a grave mistake. 
 My men are scouring the island for you as we speak. 
 And when they find you, they will kill you. 
 Very slowly, I'm afraid. 
 If your men kill us, then you'll never find the circuit board. 
 And after that, we both know that all you'll be left with is a really ugly piece of modern art. 
 What do you propose? 
 A trade. 
 I see. 
 And what do you want in exchange? 
 I want a way off the island.
