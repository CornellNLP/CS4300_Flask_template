 ♪ 
 Librarians, talk to me! What's happening? 
 No response on any military signal protocol. 
 These are secure links through buried cables of hardened cell towers. 
 It's supposed to work during a nuclear war. 
 Okay, all military communications are down. 
 What else?! 
 No Internet. 
 You can push the signals through the physical pipes, but the nodes aren't responding. 
 The Internet is gone. Welcome to 1995. 
 Ooh, I hope not. 
 I made some very poor bicycle pant choices back in '95. 
 There are no good bicycle pant choices. 
 I just got into the conduits in the street. 
 There ain't no electricity. I mean, at all. 
 I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna try to find the difference between the alternating and direct currents. 
 Maybe just a-a battery that'll hold a change. 
 This isn't 1995. This is 1859. 
 Carrington Event. 
 Massive solar flare that supercharged the Earth's electromagnetic field causing anything even remotely electric to become fried? 
 Telegraph machines bursting into flames, sparks dancing along telephone lines. 
 This is just a modern-day version, frying computer chips. 
 Okay, well, that would just burn out electronics, not keep electricity itself from working. 
 No, no, no, no, it's a magic Carrington Event. 
 You see, instead of electromagnetic energy, Prospero has infused the atmosphere with electromagic energy rewriting the laws of physics. 
 Right now nothing electronic is working. 
 If this continues, it may never work again. 
 We never get technology back. Ever. 
 He's remaking the world. 
 Into what? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 A forest. 
 Cassandra's managed to link into some satellites that are above the ionosphere, so out of the effect of the ley lines. 
 Ah. 
 They can't send or receive signals, but new satellites with live broadcasts, they have a video buffer. 
 They retain a certain amount of data before broadcasting it. 
 So we can see the news from right before it got cut out. 
 Good Intel. 
 [Typing] 
 Man :  As we are seeing below us, a giant forest is growing out of downtown... 
 Giant forest. 
 Yes. 
 And at this rate, he will turn the entire world into an arboreal paradise within days. 
 Maybe a few hours. 
 Well, we're luck... Jeez. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Dangerous? 
 No. 
 It's just lucky that he's only using the Staff of Zarathustra to aid him in his spells, 'cause if it had been the original Staff of Power, it would be a lot worse. 
 Wait, could we use the Staff of Power to reverse this? 
 Uh, yes, that probably would be the only artifact with enough power, but as you know it's broken back in 1611. 
 In fact, I will make a list of all the artifacts that have enough power. 
 It may take me a second. 
 That's your left-hand handwriting. 
 Yes. 
 Where's the note we found, Jenkins, from the broken staff? 
 Uh, top right drawer, Colonel. 
 Write this with your left hand. 
 "Not yet..." 
 "Not yet..." 
 "Not yet..." 
 "...but soon..." 
 "...but soon..." 
 "...and long ago. I pray your journey..." 
 "I pray your journey..." 
 "...does not end..." 
 "...does not end..." 
 Both : "...in woe." 
 Whoa. 
 Both : Whoa. 
 Whoa. 
 That's your handwriting. 
 That's my left-hand writing. 
 Left-hand handwriting, yes. 
 I just didn't... I didn't recognize it. 
 I wrote that note to myself in the past? 
 [Gasps] 
 I know when the staff pieces are. 
 Where? 
 Not where. When. 
 [Branches crackling] 
 [Whooshing] 
 [Whooshing stops] 
 What the devil are you doing? 
 The eternal forest within which men and women find joy, simplicity, their true nature. 
 'Tis a happy ending for all humanity, I gift to thee. 
 I'm more of a city villain than a country bumpkin. 
 You asked for refuge, and I gave it to you. 
 I took mercy on the Librarians as you asked. 
 'Tis no fault of mine you cannot hold a spell. 
 This is not your story. 
 What? 
 There is nothing in the play "The Tempest" that says this is what you want, what Prospero wants. 
 No, this? 
 This is someone else's dream. 
 [Crackling] You know not my mind! 
 Arrogant knave! 
 I summoned thee and I can crush thee! 
 [Groans] 
 You will see. 
 You will all see... in time. 
 [Door unlocks] 
 Is this the time machine room? 
 Of course, it's the time machine room. 
 The Library has to have a time machine room. 
 These are all time machines? 
 All locked down and taken apart to make sure that they never, ever work again. 
 All their owners tried to change history, got caught in temporal loops because you can never, ever, ever violate causality. 
 The very first time traveler learned that if you change any event in the past, any event of significance in the past, your timeline collapses, your entire history wiped out. 
 That's why you left the vague note. 
 Future me knew that past me was going to John Dee's estate, but I couldn't tell past me because that would violate the chain of events leading present me to know that future me was going into the past. 
 I'm going to hate time travel, aren't I? 
 A lot. 
 Ah! Here we go. This is the one. 
 We do have a little wiggle room, however... [Keys jingle] because we know the staff is broken. 
 But we don't know how. 
 And we only vaguely know when. 
 So there's a lot of uncertainty in the story. 
 So if we borrow the staff, bring it back to the present, use it to defeat Prospero, and then break it without anybody knowing, we didn't violate any rules. It's Schroedinger's Cat. 
 No, he's upstairs in the Theoretical Animals wing. 
 He's alive? 
 And if we screw up? 
 Grab that base. 
 Then we suffer the fate of the very first time traveler. 
 Dr. Pinkerton Chantasaur. 
 Was the world originally ruled by talking dinosaurs, Flynn? 
 Were we all dinosaurs? 
 Don't even think about it. 
 Was there a dinosaur me? 
 I said don't think about it. 
 Remember, in 1611, they didn't, um... 
 You know, don't do anything that's gonna change history. 
 Don't say anything to anybody that's gonna violate cause and effect that's gonna tell people what's gonna happen. 
 Right. Cause and effect. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Hey, you're gonna be there at the Library in 1611, right, Jenkins? 
 Uh, no. 
 No, I had a midlife crisis during the Elizabethan era. 
 [Inhales sharply] I was a mess. 
 Yeah, well, we're not going to the Library. 
 I'm calibrating this for Prospero's first manifestation. 
 If we can figure out how Shakespeare creates Prospero, then we grab the staff... 
 [Whooshes] 
 That should bring us home. 
 Or in 1611, we just stop Prospero from ever... 
 No, no, no, no, 'cause then, we wouldn't have to go back and then we wouldn't have stopped Prospero. 
 Then we wouldn't have to go back and then we wouldn't have stopped Prospero. 
 Then we'd have to go back and we wouldn't stop Prospero. 
 I'm  really  gonna hate time travel. 
 The good news is that no matter how much time we spend in the past, we return to this very moment. 
 From your perspective, we're gone no time at all. 
 5-second drift, maybe. We'll be back 5 seconds, tops. 
 What if you don't make it back? 
 Hmm. 
 That's why you're staying. 
 If we don't come back, you have to stop Prospero somehow. 
 I have faith in you. 
 You've trained for this. 
 [Whooshing] 
 Aah! 
 [Glass shatters] 
 [Gasps] How will they get back? 
 One second. 
 They're not. 
 Two. 
 I mean, there has to be another way, right? 
 Three. 
 Each time machine carves its own path through time. 
 Four. 
 You must use the same machine to return. 
 That's five. 
 Wh... 
 The sphere... it's... destroyed. 
 They're never, ever coming back. 
 Do you see that? 
 Ghosts from the past. 
 [Ghostly voices echo indistinctly] 
 Not spirits. We see the past itself. 
 How? 
 This place is the seat of my power, where I first became real. 
 Someone has connected that moment and this. 
 Someone... walks through time. 
 Could someone strike you down in the past? 
 They could. 
 I have one last mission for you, villain. 
 Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Okay, okay. Say they're not coming back. 
 But they are coming back. 
 How would Colonel Baird run this? 
 She would observe. 
 She'd put the facts together. 
 There are no facts. 
 We've researched Prospero and Fictionals for months, and we came up empty. 
 All we learned is they can't be destroyed, only banished. 
 Prospero's been around 500 years. 
 We would need an incredibly powerful personal link. 
 We have a clue... the note. 
 The one hint Flynn sent himself from the future. 
 I mean, there's no way that it just has one meaning, right? 
 It's just parchment. 
 Also with linen weave. It's royal quality. 
 Look at that. It's a crest, watermark. 
 Why not just write, "Hey, guys, I'm in the past. 
 Here's how you defeat Prospero"? 
 Well, if Mr. Carsen, through some misadventure, had found this note before that day in New York, had he identified Prospero any earlier, if that day had been different in any way... 
 Paradox. 
 We have to figure this out as we go. 
 All right. 
 The Count and Countess Pembroke. 
 Pembroke. 
 Why does that name sound familiar to me? 
 Mary Sidney. 
 Wilton House. 
 Fire up the back door. We just got our first clue. 
 [Exhales] 
 We're somewhere. 
 Or some  when. 
 Do not try and make that a thing. 
 Who be you, then? 
 Your garb is strange. 
 And why does the tall boy wear his hair such? 
 [Laughs] 
 "Boy"? 
 [Lowered voice] Average height for a man in 1611 is 5'5". 
 For a woman it's only 5 feet. Let me do all the talking. 
 I'm a master of dialects. 
 [Exaggerated accent] Prithee sirrahs, we are but humble travelers upon yon road come forthwith from Londontowne, whence we purchased these robes of foreign soils. 
 Spies. They're clearly spies, right? 
 Right. 
 Foreign spies! 
 Masterful dialecting. Dialected the hell out of that. 
 [Grunting] 
 God, this man smells very bad! 
 Well, don't hurt him too badly. He could be an ancestor. 
 [Straining] Aid! Aid! 
 Ugh, ugh! It's on me! His smell is on me! 
 Like, like, like, like a bad ham drank burnt coffee and then jogged 5 miles in old underwear he never took off ever! [Sniffs] 
 [Strained voice] They never really talk about that in the old movies about time travel. 
 The past stinks. 
 [Shoe thuds] 
 Also, they're going to be a surprising amount of pus. 
 Now put on that man's clothes. 
 Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No way. 
 Nope, nope, nope, nope. nope. 
 Eve, you have flawless skin. 
 And you're a foot and a half taller than any other woman around, and you're wearing pants. You're not gonna fit in. 
 [Blusters] 
 Uhh! 
 [Body thuds] 
 Come with me if you want to live. 
 Please do not tell me that is a robot from the future. 
 I could not process that right now. 
 Prospero. 
 Where's Moriarty? 
 I'm betting he sent him back in time to stop Flynn and Baird. 
 We can't warn them. 
 We can only send messages one way through time... forward, the long way around. 
 Colonel Baird and Mr. Carsen can fend for themselves. 
 We need to get inside Wilton House. 
 [Lowered voice] Of course, the Wilton House. 
 The Countess Pembroke, Mary Sidney, she was one of Shakespeare's patrons. 
 In fact, his troupe used to come here in summer from London. 
 London... [British accent] Thank you very much. 
 [Normal voice] London in the summer can get a bit plague-y. 
 And that is rat. [Retches, spits] 
 [Retches] 
 Very, very ratty. 
 The first performance of Shakespeare's "Tempest" is here today. 
 The moment Prospero magically emerges from the page. 
 Why are you being so chummy? 
 I tricked Prospero into sending me here as his agent. 
 I want you to help me destroy him. 
 You've betrayed us in the past. 
 The future past. Oh, man, I hate time travel. 
 I didn't think you stood a chance before, but I deduce you're here for the Staff of Power. 
 I have a plan. 
 I also have a plan. 
 We find Shakespeare, we discover how he accidentally creates Prospero, we grab the Staff of Power, we return to the future where we defeat Prospero there, and then we come back with the Staff of Power and hopefully don't violate causality. 
 I have a far simpler plan and a much more convincing British accent. 
 Ooh, two for two. [Pats arm] 
 ♪ 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 We are still in need of players for the new work, and the author shall hear you read. 
 Oh! 
 [Giggling] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Did you hear that, Eve? We get to audition as actors. 
 I am pretty much guaranteed to get a part, so that means access to Shakespeare. 
 And we shouldn't just try and stop Prospero? 
 Somebody did. He was powerless for centuries. 
 [Whispers] No, we can't risk that somebody else is meant to. 
 Say, which do you prefer? Yay or nay or yay or... nay. 
 Nay. Good time. Here. 
 We wait for Prospero to show up, we get the staff, take that back to the future. 
 And we definitely shouldn't try and kill Shakespeare. 
 No, absolutely not. Why... 
 [Screaming] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Click] 
 [Clamoring] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! He just saved Shakespeare. 
 Indeed, hold. 
 The boy speaks the truth. 
 That gawky fellow has spared my blood from foulest murder. 
 [Clank] 
 [Grunts] 
 A drink for thee. Here. 
 [Clenching teeth] Do we violate cause and effect if we talk to Shakespeare? 
 I gotta be honest, my whole plan is very fuzzy right now. 
 ♪ 
 He's coming! He's coming! 
 [Clears throat] He's coming. 
 [British accent] Um, art thou all right? 
 He did not hit me with the bolt. 
 I suffered a fit some months ago. 
 But my wits, despite what some may say, are still sharp enough to detect your odd accent. 
 Oh. Uh, I-I thought my accent was pretty good. 
 No. 
 Uh, we're Flemish. 
 [Clearing throat] From Flanders. 
 Ja, vay Zane ecta kasskopen, oh! 
 [Laughing] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Of course, yes, I recognize the cadence now. 
 Cheers, and drinks for our friends from Flanders. 
 All : Cheers! 
 Ah! Good wine is a familiar creature if it be well used. 
 "Othello." 
 A familiar creature with my work, you are. 
 You have no idea. You have no idea. 
 Assassin, why expose yourself before the king arrives? 
 King James is coming here? 
 Indeed, to see the very first performance of my new play. 
 That'll prove it to him... 
 Absolutely, William, he will see. 
 Off me! I'm not so weak. 
 You two sought an audition with me. 
 [Stifled laugh] 
 Come. You've earned it. 
 [Blusters] 
 Why didn't you tell me your plan was to kill Shakespeare? 
 I thought it was obvious. 
 Look, Carsen's a fool. 
 "...was not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking glass..." 
 [Sighs] 
 You need to strike Shakespeare down the first chance that you get. 
 [Laughs] And doom the future? 
 Any future where I may yet serve another, I'll risk. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 ♪ 
 [Door opens] 
 I don't know, the letters are different sizes. 
 It's tricky. 
 Had to be. 
 The entire scheme depended on Mr. Carsen not noticing his own clues. 
 Third letter, first letter, second letter, fourth letter... 
 There's no variation to the alphanumeric cipher. 
 I mean, it's unlike any language I've ever seen. 
 The Fleveh Collection. Flanders, the largest collection of Shakespearean objects on permanent display. 
 "Fleve."  Flynn and Eve. 
 Ah. 
 Good. We're on the right track. 
 You know what it means if they sent this complicated a message back through time. 
 It means they knew they couldn't bring it with them. 
 They're not coming back. 
 Then we do right by them. [Exhales]

 Oh! Ah. 
 I cannot live... to hear the news... from England. 
 Ah!

 Not sure why that's all even in there. 
 Rather important bit, actually.

 Breaks a noble heart. 
 Oh! 
 Good night, sweet Prince. 
 Flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! 
 Why?! Why?! 
 Why?

 Your sword work is impeccable. 
 Oh! Oh. 
 Your... mastery of the text, uh, honestly unprecedented. 
 [Laughs] Oh, my. I can't... 
 Uh, your acting... 
 Ah! 
 I'm afraid it's just too obvious English is your second language. 
 [Spits loudly] 
 Sorry. 
 But you, my boy, if only you'd come to me before your growth spurt. 
 That skin, those features. 
 You would've made a great Juliet or Portia. 
 It's so hard to find convincing women. 
 Or you could just hire female actors.

 [Man laughing] 
 [Laughing continues] 
 You Flemish! 
 You're not just brave, but jovial. [Laughs] 
 I must add a Flanders lad to my next play. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs, mutters] 
 Where did you get that quill? 
 Oh, a gift from my friend, John Dee. 
 The wizard, John Dee? 
 Wizard? Oh, the tales he tells. 
 This very quill he swears is from ancient Arabia, carved from a branch of the Tree of Knowledge. 
 Hogwash. 
 [Sighs] 'Tis my good luck charm, though. 
 I've writ every play with it. 
 [Lowered voice] Now we know why he's the world's greatest writer... magic pen, kind of a cheat. 
 [Lowered voice] Magic pen wouldn't be enough. 
 He'd already have to be a genius. 
 It only boosts his level of writing. 
 Power, effect, focus. 
 Power, focus, effect. 
 That's what I meant. 
 Prospero said he got his Staff of Power from the Tree of Knowledge. 
 I've got a bad feeling about this. 
 [British accent] Uh, William, sir, would it be possible for us to just be perhaps extras in tonight's production? 
 Oh, afraid not, lad. [Sighs] 
 Tonight's far too important. 
 We play to keep the king's favor. 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 The future of the troupe, my future, depends upon it. 
 Oh, I'm sure he'll love "The Tempest." 
 "The Tempest"? 
 That's not the name. 
 'Tis "The Triumph of Prospero." 
 [Under breath] Very bad feeling about this. 
 
 
 
 ♪ 
 Hey. 
 You know, the legend states that when England is in its hour of greatest need, Arthur will return. 
 "He who wielded Excalibur before shall wield it again, and save all England." 
 The idea of seeing my friend again, after all this time... 
 But Arthur is long dead. 
 And as Colonel Baird said, we are on our own. 
 Only thieves hide things in plain sight. 
 Keep checking the surfaces. There has to be some kind of... [Door opening] 
 Hey. Hey! 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Flynn, he's not gonna just have the Staff of Power in his props. 
 He's got a magical pen from John Dee. 
 Who knows what he could've picked up in a junk shop? 
 London is the most magical city in the world. 
 A magical artifact in London is like finding a toaster at a yard sale. 
 You should hear this. 
 And to Milan I so return, with dread art and magicks dire. 
 To reclaim my throne and make the world my own. 
 This is not "The Tempest" I remember. 
 In this version, Prospero conquers the world. 
 It's like he's working out his issues about being forced into retirement. 
 It's like he's trying to become some kind of, uh... 
 Magical badass. 
 I know thou thinks I'm old and feeble, weak of arm and infirm of mind. 
 But I am still he who ruled. 
 I am still the man whose wit conquered knowledge arcane and words ruled courts and kings. 
 [Grunts] 
 Power... 
 His rage about being discarded and forgotten. 
 His wish to be powerful enough to spite his enemies. 
 Focus... 
 The magical quill, the instrument that changes his thoughts into reality cut from the Tree of Knowledge itself. 
 Effect... 
 I am still the man whose words remake the very world before your eyes. 
 I return triumphant! 
 Prospero!

 Yes, Flynn? 
 When I say run from the evil wizard...

 Running from the evil wizard!

 No, no!

 Aah! 
 [Cackling] 
 [Screaming continues] 
 The witches and the floating dagger. 
 That's from "Macbeth." 
 The donkey head, that's Bottom from "Midsummer's." 
 Turned a statue, that's, uh... "Winter's Tale." 
 Prospero can only do magic from the plays. 
 Prospero's a manifestation of Shakespeare's id. 
 He's using Shakespeare's imagination. 
 So it's not so much a transformation as a possession. 
 He's being possessed by one of his own creations. 
 William, what madness is this? 
 Not madness, clarity. 
 My mind, my vision unbound. 
 King James will be here any moment. 
 His army marches behind him. 
 His soldiers will strike you down. 
 So the king will come here seeking sanctuary. 
 I will murder James and become ruler of all England... and then the world. 
 I will not watch you do this. 
 I grant thy wish. 
 [Whoosh] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Laughing] 
 [Screaming, sobbing] 
 Murdering King James is definitely not part of history. 
 We're gonna need help, all the help we can get. 
 Amazing. 
 This is the first full manuscript of "The Tempest." 
 Handwritten. 
 This quill... I know this wood. 
 It's the Tree of Knowledge. 
 All this hidden here this entire time? Amazing. 
 I don't understand what we're... are we supposed to wear this? 
 Well, Prospero regained his power with elements of his story. 
 And Mr. Carsen has given us another story. 
 The manuscript, the quill, they represent... 
 Shakespeare. 
 The donkey head. 
 Bottom, "Midsummer Night's Dream." 
 Bloke got turned into a man with a donkey head by magic. 
 It was a movie. 
 Yes. 
 I'd have to be, wouldn't it? 
 Seems like that would be the reason. 
 Transformation. Now traditionally, the magic cloak is worn by Prospero. 
 Carnations? 
 That's just weird. It's not a traditional prop. 
 Matter of fact, in "Winter's Tale," there's a woman who rants about how much she hates them because they're unnatural. 
 Unnatural. How? 
 Because they're two things grafted together. 
 Author transformed by magic, magician, grafted together. 
 Out there? That's just not Prospero. 
 He's Shakespeare. 
 What we have here are the ritual elements of an exorcism. 
 I think we have a fighting chance.

 We don't stand a chance. 
 Well, you certainly don't, getting yourself all kerfuffled the way that you have. 
 I hope you see, Eve, that he's really not that great. 
 I mean, the man is in stocks, and I'm free. - [Sighs] 
 The man can't move and I am free as a bird. 
 I'm just saying. 
 Shakespeare has summoned Prospero. 
 You should've let me kill him. 
 Actually, Shakespeare turned  into  Prospero. 
 Surprising. 
 My plan still would've worked, though. 
 How 'bout we get me out of these? 
 Yes, yes, I'm working on that. 
 Shakespeare is Prospero. Options. 
 Well, this explains Shakespeare's plan in the future. 
 You see, Shakespeare was obsessed with forests, their purity, their happiness. 
 I was working on it. 
 This hasn't, uh, changed anything at all. 
 We just stick to my plan. 
 [Lock clinks] 
 We get the Staff of Power, we use it to get back to the future, and we stop Prospero there. 
 Odds are if we strike now, we can still kill him. 
 Kill him, kill him, kill him, said the once and future villain. 
 I'll have you know, sir, I do not take kindly to such language. 
 Well, if we kill him here, we will never meet him there. 
 Well, if you... Stop! 
 What? 
 Stop. Stop. 
 Every time. All day. 
 Stop. 
 All day long! 
 Stop! Stop, stop, stop. Stop. 
 Work together or die alone. 
 Okay. 
 What's your plan? 
 Prospero's story ends with his staff broken and book drowned, right? 
 Right. 
 Well, then that's what we're gonna do.

 [Thunder rumbling] 
 Do you trust him? 
 Eh. 
 Do you trust me? 
 I trust you the most. 
 Okay, then I'm gonna be honest and say that I don't think that even if we get this book, we're gonna be able to break this staff. 
 It's gonna take an object of much greater power. 
 How much power? 
 Off the top of my head, I'd say Excalibur, but he's long gone. 
 You know, there's a story about England in its greatest time of need... 
 Prospero : Who's there?!

 If you would drown my book, do it properly!

 No! No!

 Ah! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Sword thuds] 
 You are but a story. 
 I... unwrite thee! 
 Uhh! 
 [Panting and grunting] 
 Don't worry. This isn't how your story ends. 
 [Weakly] Flynn, his staff is his pen. 
 Break it, and you can rewrite the story. 
 [Whooshing] 
 You would break my staff?! 
 [Crackling] 
 Aah! 
 What have you?! Steel? Fists?!

 [Weakly] Excalibur. 
 You are not Arthur. 
 Only he can wield that sword, Excalibur. 
 Flynn! 
 [Sounds of barking and whimpering] 
 'Cal, come! 
 [Growling] 
 [Grunting] 
 "Of all the wonders I yet had heard, it seems to me the most strange that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come." 
 It's about rejecting death's power. 
 It has no power over me.

 [Clanking] 
 "I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence." 
 It's knowing yourself. Being yourself. 
 [Grunting] 
 "I'll so offend, to make offence a skill, redeeming time when men think least I will." 
 It's about how becoming the hero is that much sweeter when no one expects you to. 
 [Grunting] 
 [Clanking] 
 [Whoosh] 
 You have wielded Excalibur before. When?! 
 In the future. 
 Don't worry. Nobody understands time travel. 
 [Grunts] 
 His words... those are  his  words! 
 No! No! 
 What kind of sorcery is this? 
 The pen transformed you once while you were telling Prospero's story. 
 Now you hold book and quill and you hear his words. 
 This is Shakespeare's story. 
 [Whooshing] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Mr. Shakespeare, I presume. 
 [Crackling, whoosh] 
 What was that sound? 
 'Cal! 
 Wow. 
 Oh, he's in there somewhere. 
 But he's just newly born. Or newly reborn. 
 It's gonna take him a little while to get back to full strength. 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Crackling, whoosh] 
 It's a paradox portal. 
 You're alive. 
 Kinda. 
 Greetings from the far end of five centuries. 
 There's a hole in the timeline. Time's trying to repair itself. 
 Shakespeare needs to live out his days here as history remembers. 
 Great, Will, you step through to your time, we'll step through to ours, all... all good. 
 I'm afraid not. 
 Once Master Shakespeare is back in 1611, the primary paradox is closed. 
 Timeline requires that he live out life in the past, but it will not allow you to return. 
 That's not fair. 
 Nobody said it would be. 
 So what are we gonna do? 
 They already know. 
 Ride safe. 
 Check your six. 
 Take care of each other. 
 No. 
 Steal something shiny. 
 Leave it somewhere interesting for me to find. 
 Don't ever change, Jones. 
 Why would I? 
 I, uh... still don't like you. 
 Likewise. 
 Don't. 
 No. Don't. 
 Ah, I will figure this out. I will find... 
 No, don't live your life for anybody else. 
 Go have your own adventure. 
 He who wielded Excalibur before shall wield it again and save all of England. 
 Mr. Carsen, you wielded Excalibur before. 
 Very well done, sir. 
 It was a pleasure, Colonel. 
 Every moment. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Whooshes] 
 Thank you very much for aiding me with this project. 
 It's important that we know if the Library has, indeed, fully returned. 
 Yeah, well, it's good if I stay busy. 
 Keeps my mind off things. 
 Ah. The others? 
 The others? 
 Well, Jones is pretending he's fine. 
 And Cassandra ain't pretending at all. 
 When the Library... when it rearranged itself, it really screwed itself up. 
 There were rooms that were upside down. 
 There were three rooms that changed color. 
 One room was inside out... 
 I... 
 Don't ask. 
 Do you have the, um, do you have the key to the locked room? 
 Hmm. There is no key. It's always been locked. 
 Mr. Carsen and I have tried to gained entry many times. 
 But there's a sign on the door that says you have the key. 
 There's no sign on that door. 
 See? 
 That has never been visible before. 
 It's some kind of copper alloy. 
 Well, oxidation is what turns copper green. 
 I mean, the Statue of Liberty used to be all shiny, and then it oxidized. 
 If you hid a message in a copper alloy that blends itself with the surrounding metals, you wouldn't be able to detect it until it oxidized. 
 Nice trick! 
 Time-delay metallurgic cryptography. 
 Yeah, but that's a lot of time. 
 Statue of Liberty took two decades to turn green. 
 This must've taken... 
 Centuries? 
 Message from the past, hidden. 
 Not visible until this very moment. 
 Sound familiar? 
 "Jenkins, the key is in your Guardian's name." 
 You don't have a Guardian. 
 Of course I do. 
 Eve Baird. 
 [Lock clicks, clanking] 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Gasps] 
 ♪ 
 Who would've... 
 [Crackling] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughter] 
 Did you miss us? 
 You guys did time travel the... long way around. 
 Inspired, sir. 
 Well, I kind of have to give Eve credit for this one. 
 I'm sorry for you two to be trapped here in my time. 
 Look at the bright side. We saved the world. 
 They're probably putting a statue of us up at the Library. 
 "A Winter's Tale." 
 You turned Hermione into a statue. 
 And... and Prospero did the same thing with the quill and the staff. 
 We can travel through time? 
 Eve, anybody could time travel, just in one direction. 
 I'll need you to use your pen one last time. 
 Flynn : We created the spell to open the door, prepared the plaque as our alchemical alarm clock, packed the clues that you would need to exorcise Prospero. 
 Then past me wrote future me the letter I knew I would discover myself in the future... or now the past future. 
 Baird : I really hate time travel. 
 Flynn : Shakespeare used his magic pen one last time writing the story of how a dashing Librarian and a gorgeous Guardian were transformed into a statue to be awoken by the sound of Cassandra's voice. 
 And then he shipped us to the Library labeled as dangerous artifacts, along with a letter explaining how to magically seal us in. 
 Just your average slice of incredibly complex causal cake. 
 Oh. [Giggles] 
 Did we miss anything? I mean, other than 400 years. 
 Dinosaurs are back. 
 [Laughs] 
 Wait, really? 
 [Both laughing] 
 Jones, magical crime. 
 Stone, legends, history come to life, things that go bump in the night. 
 Cassandra, how science and math interact with magic. 
 Mathemagics. 
 Never gonna be a thing. 
 Give me a theoretical framework. 
 I want action plans, incident reports, weekly updates, and cross references. 
 You all know what you're capable of. 
 Let's do this. 
 Okay, boys, there's still a lot of rooms in this place that we haven't checked out. 
 So I say we set up here and then my lab can go here. 
 Finally, permission to steal anything we want. 
 This is what you got from that speech? 
 Subtext, mate. 
 Come on, come on, that's it. 
 That's it. 
 There ya go. 
 Hey, twice as far as yesterday. 
 Just took a little time. 
 Like most things. 
 What? 400-year-long kiss wasn't enough time? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I was wondering what you remembered about that. 
 Well, I was thinking that if they'd never found us, kissing you was exactly how I'd want to spend eternity. 
 Hmm. 
 You know, you don't have to run anymore. 
 No. I mean, unless I'm being chased. 
 By all the things that are always trying to kill us. 
 Countless murderous... many murderous creatures and myths. 
 Yes, well, in that case, you should run. 
 But other than that... stay a while. 
 Our Library. 
 Hmm. 
 What? 
 Oh, I was just thinking. 
 Should that table be round? 
 [Panting sound, bark] 
 [Slap] 
 'Cal! [Laughs] He's feeling better. 
 [Laughs]
