 (gasps) Go back! 
 Go back where? 
 Where are we? 
 Why am I wet? 
 What's with the hourglass? 
 I don't know, but it looks familiar. 
 Where's Cassandra? 
 Phone is fried. 
 So's mine. Soaked. 
 Does anybody remember how we got here? 
 Pizza! There was pizza. I remember the anchovies. 
 You don't like anchovies. 
 Which is why I remember them. 
 Stone, recognize any of this? 
 Looks like smoky quartz, but different. I've never seen anything like this. 
 Okay, so let's recap. 
 We don't know where we are or why we're wet. 
 We can't remember anything that happened before this. 
 Apart from pizza. 
 And garlic bread. 
 Some amazing garlic bread. 
 Mystery solved. We were ambushed by an Olive Garden. 
 Come on, guys, think. What are we missing about this place? 
 Well, it's got a cleanin' lady. 
 Hola. 
 (loud metallic ringing) (loud metallic ringing) That sound. I... I remember. There  was  pizza. Stone : Where do you hide a massive actual pyramid? Inside another massive actual pyramid! The Luxor Casino in Vegas. It's genius! I mean, who'd ever think to look for a real Egyptian pyramid under a fake American one? These guys. Ugh, anchovies. First round's on me. Silver bullets. Pew-pew! Pew! Only three beers? You're not gonna turn it loose? No, you're gonna turn it loose. I'm exhausted. Completely and utterly, uh... What's the word, Jones? Knackered. I need a bath and a bed. Good night. Oh, hey, oh, no! You can't go, because we're having fun! Funny-fun-fun! Fun with Baird. Non-stop fun. Non-stop fun. A couple beers. What? What's anything? Baird : I... What? We're just really worried about you. Well, we thought you might... be lonely. You know, with Flynn doing his whole "Flynn be gone" routine, and... Guys, that's just... it's... it's really sweet, actually. But I'm fine, really fine. Really. We just want you to know that we're here for you. Because the Guardian protects the Librarians, but who protects the Guardian? Ooh. It's kind of a buzzkill when I put it like that. Ah. Oh, okay. Okay, I get it. Is that why you left me that present this morning, as a little pick-me-up? What? What present? This compact mirror. It's beautiful. It's engraved, and it has this nice stone, and it's silver... Who would want something as useless as that? Oh, thank God. I was trying to work out how to pretend I liked it. Maybe Flynn left it for you. Leave it to Flynn to give me something completely useless. Now a crossbow, that would've come in handy in the secret underground pyramid. You know what I love about secret underground pyramids? The souvenirs. Jones, you can't just take coins from a historical site. You gotta give 'em... Don't you dare use the M word! ...to a museum! (fizzling) Stone :  You think it's a blackout? Cassandra :  Why did everyone stop moving? (thunder cracks) (loud scraping) (rings) (rings) (rings) (whispers) Eve Baird. Tonight... (scraping) Did you all just see that? That's him, that's the one. He is an ancient, vengeful quasi-deity and he is called the "Reaper." You can't see his face in any of these pictures. Jenkins :  No, no one ever sees the Reaper's face. It is as impossible to see his face as it is to escape his clutches. So what are those? Hourglass. Prophecy cube. Prophecy cube baffles me. The hourglass is simple enough. The Reaper is a supernatural assassin, summoned by magic users to kill other magic users, or it seems, in this case, a Guardian. You mean I'm the hit? Wait, no offense, but why her? I... I... the hourglass. You have until the sands run out tonight  and then the Reaper will return for you. Listen, Skippy. "Skippy"? There's an easy way to stop an hourglass. There is no way to stop the Reaper, Eve. (clanging, scraping) (scraping continues) (ringing) Search for a door! If we got in, we can get out! I'm on it. Dios, ayudame!  What is that thing? I'm sorry, what's your name? Nina. Nina Mitrani. Nina, don't worry about it. Just focus on finding a door. But if we can't get out, can it get in? Shouldn't we stay here? The lady makes a good point. (scuffling) Baird...? Whatever you are, show yourself. I surrender! To who? To you. You don't need to surrender to me. Okay... I don't then? What's your name, bubba? Tyson Lopez. You always walk around with two pairs of swim goggles, Tyson? I don't know. Are these mine? Uh, swim... A swimming pool! Yes, we were at a school. That's a letter jacket. What is that... "MH," "MH"? Mayfield High. Man :  Mayfield High? That's  my  school. Principal Fairbrother? Tyson? Nina? How did you... You're all from the same school? And you are? All : The Librarians. I don't think so. None of you is Mrs. Jennings. Listen, are you on the swim team? Yeah, I'm captain. Aha! Hence the goggles. What do you mean, "hence"? Hence that he put on two pair of goggles, and we, fully clothed, jumped into an amnesia pool? Can we recap? We don't know where we are or how we got here. It's okay, I already did the recap. Oh, excuse me. Are you in charge here? Well, yes. Actually, I am. Oh. Really? So the three of you are from the same school. It must mean something. Captain of the swim team, Mayfield High... I've seen you before! From the clippings book. I don't get it, Jenkins. Who'd want  me  dead? Come on, Baird, don't be so modest. Who doesn't want you dead? How about the agents of DOSA? How about a crazy Egyptian god named Apep? Whoever it is is very powerful. It takes a very big dose of magic to summon the Reaper. Well, can we reverse the summoning? No. The Reaper cannot be unsummoned. He will only leave this plane of existence once he has his kill. Who guards the Guardian? What is a prophecy cube and why does the Reaper have one? A prophecy cube has a vision of the future that is, to use a modern parlance, downloaded into a cube of prophecy glass. Looking at the patterns on this one, I would say it was forged by the Oracle of Delphi. You mean, like, Perseus? The very same. When Perseus was a baby, his grandfather, King Acrisius of Argos, tried to murder him. The Oracle of Delphi forged a prophecy cube, saying that Perseus would try to kill him so his grandfather tried to kill him before he had the chance. See? King Acrisius' prophecy cube, the same patterns. Yeah, and the king cast Perseus and his mother out to sea in a wooden chest, they were rescued by fishermen, but Perseus grew up hating his grandfather because of what he had done. And when he was old enough, Perseus returned to Argos and killed the king. The moral of the story being, when the king saw the prophecy, it became self-fulfilling. Trying to defeat it only made it come true. What does any of this have to do with me? Well, I strongly suspect that this cube contains a vision of your death. Well, then, I need to see it. Didn't you just hear the story, the king? If you see your future, you could be creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Any actions you take to avoid it may actually make it come true. I'd rather have a heads-up than be blindsided. Well, hold it to your forehead and ask it to show you its truth. (sighs) Okay. Show me what you got. Woman :  When the last grain of sand falls from the hourglass, you shall die by the Reaper's hand within these Library walls. (gasps) I saw my death... here, in the Library. No, no. Here, Library, are you sure? So as long as she's not in the Library it can't kill her, according to the rules of the prophecy. What are we doing? We gotta get her out of here! No, you do not. Stay right here. It is the one safe place. The Reaper cannot get into the Library, it won't let him! What? People break in all the time! Dulaque, Morgan Le Fay, Moriarty, Lamia, Prospero! None of them are the Reaper. Do you realize how many hostiles wanted to assassinate Librarians over the centuries? The Library was designed to be  specifically  Reaper-proof. I saw him kill me right here. Right here is the last place I should be. No, there's some other... Oh, incoming! All the clippings are about one high school in Seattle. Stone :  Mayfield High. Maybe the Library's trying to help Baird, send her somewhere safe? "17 Mayfield High Students Get Best Exam Results In State." Stone :  "Families of 17 Mayfield High Students Win 17 State Lotteries"? Sounds like my kind of high school. "Tyson Lopez, Swim Team Captain,  Wins Olympic Training Experience." That's a whole lot of luck for one high school. Maybe a bit of good luck's what I need. Jenkins! Fire up the back door. Ah, please. Eve, you cannot beat fate. Stay here. The Library can protect you from the Reaper. But it doesn't. I saw myself die, here in the Library. No, please. Do not let one glimpse of foresight cloud your judgment. Remember King Acrisius. I'm a soldier, a Guardian. I can't just sit back and wait for fate to catch up to me. Now open it up, Skippy. How did we get here? This isn't Mayfield High. I'm running and he's still caught me. Stone : Not yet. Not while he's behind that wall. Ezekiel :  If there is a door, I'll find it way before "Mr. Stabby Fingers" does. (scraping) Ignore it. He's just trying to psyche you out. (metallic ringing) What is that thing? Both : Get behind me. No, you get behind me. I know what I'm doing. Demonio!  It's the devil. I said get behind me! It's me he wants, me. (rings) Caramba.  Has it stalled? Why aren't you attacking? What's your game? Ezekiel :  If he's stopped, he's stopped. Let's not argue with Mr. Stabby Fingers right now. Keep searching for the door. Stone :  Look for irregularities. If Cassandra was here, she'd spot it. Who's Cassandra? Cassandra. Cassandra, the goggles! I know where she is. (class bell rings) All right, Mayfield High School, here we are. The Library sent us here. What's safe about a high school? Nothing. It's the most dangerous environment known to mankind. Geek. Hey, leave him alone! You pick on him, I'll pick on you. It's the kid from the clippings book. Tyson Lopez? Yeah, oh, hey! What did I win now? Who are you people? Do you have permission to be on school grounds? Absolutely we do. We're the Librarians. I don't think so. None of you is Mrs. Jennings. Now, if you don't show me some ID in the next five seconds, I'm calling the police. Your test results are amazing. I mean, 17 seniors jumping from D and F grades to across-the-board A-plus? I mean, in one student that would be unlikely, but in 17, I mean the odds are what, 0.02%? You're from the school board? What do you think? What can I say? Since I took over the running of this troubled school, I've been turning it around. So your explanation for having impossible grades is that you "Oh, Captain, my Captain" them? Fairbrother :  I have nothing to hide. My students' success comes from the hard work ethic we instill in them. Uh, and the fact that they all won the lottery? Coincidence. Stone :  No coincidence. Coincidence is dating two girls at the same time and then finding out they're sisters. By the way, bad idea. Fairbrother : It is a coincidence. What are you suggesting? That they used a crystal ball? (laughs) What about a cube? About this big, glass covered in symbols? I think I'd like to have a parent or guardian present. A Guardian's right here, mate. Is there anything else that connects these 17 extremely lucky students to each other? Well, I suppose... They're all on the swim team. Tyson :  Well, with the exams, the questions were ones I sort of knew. Right. Right, right, right. (fast beeping) I'm getting some crazy readings off this pool. What is that thing? Uh, this is a... matriculator. Yeah, it's used for matriculating. It's cutting-edge school board equipment. Hey, and what about the lottery, Tyson? I won first prize in a sports lottery, a training week at the Olympic swim center in Greece. I mean, I've never even been out of Seattle before, and there was me, swimming on Mt. Parnassus. Tyson, are you leaking? What's with the water? Nothing. I was just thirsty. Yeah, I'm guessing you heard about the legend of Mt. Parnassus. The lake water's supposed to give  anybody who bathes in it special powers. I just thought... Thought you'd bring back some water from Greece, put it in the pool, see if you could improve the performance of the swim team? Yeah, but it didn't work. I don't think the water really does anything. (beeping) Oh, ignore those. Those are nothing. Nothing? Awful lot of magic on these goggles to be nothing. I saw a vision of the future. I was opening a big door. It had a Medusa on it. I had a black eye! Yeah, what I saw, horrifying. I was gonna give one of these to the museum. Don't worry, baby. Daddy's never gonna let you go. Wow... Goggles that can see the future, and the entire swim team has goggles? That's how you knew the lottery numbers and the exam answers. No! Well, maybe, sort of. A bit. Am I in trouble? What the hell are you people talking about? Take these back to Jenkins, run some tests. Got it. Be safe. What sort of tests do legitimate librarians run on swimming goggles? (metallic scraping) What's that sound? (thunder rumbles) Get out of here! Run! (thunder crashes) Go back! Go back! Go back! So then we fell in the pool and then woke up here. I remember now. We must've teleported. That's why our memories are fritzed. Tyson, goggles. If there's a door in here, we'd find it eventually, right? Let's see how we do it. Make a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why not? (rumbles) Do you smell incense? I've seen how we do it. It's here. (rumbles) Come on! Everybody out. You smell incense? Oh, I hate prophecy more than I hate time travel. Not dead yet. Is everybody here? Everybody okay? At least we're drying off a little now, to look on the bright side. Everybody except Nina. You still look pretty soaked. Eh, I'm a cleaning lady in a high school. I've dealt with worse. From here on, we move forward as a team. Everyone stick together. Be careful. 
 
 (stone rumbles, crashes) Stone! Baird! Colonel! Stone! Jones! Baird! Colonel? Stone! Baird! Colonel! Jones! It's no good, it's no good. All right, we keep moving, we'll catch up with 'em. There's two exits. Which door do we take? There's a message. It's in Greek. Anyone here read Greek? Oh, I do. I studied at Cambridge. (metallic scraping) Well, come on! Time to pick a door. It doesn't say which is which,  only that one door is the exit,  and the other leads to... certain death. (metallic scraping) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What? It says "This room is the Zeus challenge. Step wisely or suffer the wrath of Zeus." What's the wrath of Zeus? (explosion rumbles) Seriously. You had to ask? All right, we gotta cross this floor. You step on the wrong square, zap. How do we tell the zap squares from the non-zap squares? Hey, "Gold will lead the way." Gold? Who's got... No, no, no, no. Back off, Stone. You are not flogging any of my gold. Amazing. Plastic lenses in these utterly normal swimming goggles have somehow been transmuted into prophecy glass. Tyson was putting water from Mt. Parnassus into the pool. What if the water brought back something with it? I'm gonna call Baird and see if she can get a sample. She's not answering. Hmm. Jenkins, she's not answering. (beeps, clicks) Oh. (beeping) Another prophecy cube. Darse prisa!  Pick one, just pick! There must be a clue! Come on, think. We need more information. We fell in the pool. We woke up here. Except Nina, where were you when we fell? Cleaning the pool. You fell in the water with us? Si, claro!  Of course! No one notices the cleaning lady. No, it's not my time yet. It's not my time yet. You can't kill me until the sand runs out which means whatever door I pick must be the correct one. Maybe you don't die, but we could all get chopped to bits. Lady, if you're gonna pick, pick quick. Left, right, left! Come on! The thing about this gold is that it's particularly nice. I mean, the thought of it getting zapped isn't exactly what I'm trying to go... Let me ask you a question, okay? What does Ezekiel Jones love more, hmm? Gold... or Ezekiel Jones? Point taken. Eenie, meenie, miney, Moe. (coin clatters) Ooh, it worked. It's non-zap. Right. Step one. Catch the Reaper by his toe. My beautiful innocent gold! All right, get over it. Next square! Zeus! Red, blue. A second prophecy cube. You know what this makes me want to do? What? Makes me want to go, "Hmm." Okay, I think I found two ways that a self-fulfilling prophecy can be broken. One, you get someone outside of the prophecy to intervene and change the course of events. And two, you create an even bigger self-fulfilling prophecy around the first. Yes. Many centuries ago the Oracle forged a prophecy cube and she saw herself within it. She was being murdered by one of her 33 high priestesses, though she couldn't see which one. So she forged new prophecy cubes, one for each of the priestesses, containing a vision of them dying at the hands of the person they married. So how did she link the prophecies? She married each of the priestesses, meaning that the Oracle became the person prophesied to kill each of them, meaning that they couldn't kill  her,  because otherwise she wouldn't be alive to kill  them. My brain just exploded. But exactly right. The Oracle murdered her wives on their wedding night, hence the prophecy cube containing her death exploded. The prophecy was broken. That's brutal. Yes. So what we have to do is find an overriding prophecy, something bigger than the death of a Guardian, or Colonel Baird will die in short order. (clicking) (coin clinks) Ooh! Nice. Nope, definitely this one. I'm gonna die here. You're not gonna die. All right? Think positive. We're halfway across. Halfway across. But we're down to our last coin, which allows us only one mistake. Stone, this is the coin from my vision, the one that I give to a museum in the future, and that means, if I give this coin to a museum in the future, It cannot be destroyed today. Exactly, which means no matter which square I throw this on, it has to be safe. (coin clinks) (all exclaim) You're amazing! I know I am. Bite me, Zeus! All right. You're worried about them, aren't you? Oh, I'm always worried about them. I'm their Guardian. You mean you look after them? Yep, and I know what you're gonna say, I sound like their nanny. Oh, please. Good leaders care about the people they lead. That's what good leadership is. Like Mr. Fairbrother. The kids are terrified of him,  but he loves them like his own children,  and nobody needs goggles made of prophecy glass to see that. That's very kind of you, Nina. (sighs) (both yelling) There's a weapons room. They were attacking me. Over my dead body. Right, right. So what's the plan? Well, we find the Colonel and escape this crystal funhouse. Let's have a look-see behind door number one. (yells) (gasps) It's Baird. She's gone mental. Come on. It's arming itself. You're not actually Colonel Baird. You're in disguise. You're Zeus, aren't you? Jones, what? Of course, I'm me. The Baird we know would never attack us. And the Stone and Ezekiel I know would never attack me. Don't listen to it! Grab sharp things! Do not touch those weapons, I'm warning you. Yeah? Well... warn this! Oop...! (bangs) Agh-hh...! Why is heavy metal so bloody heavy? We know you're gonna attack us. We saw it in the future. Yeah, well, I saw the future too, and I saw you attacking  me. Why  would I attack you? Why would I attack  you? (both yelling) (yells) Wait, wait! The only reason you're fighting right now is because you saw yourselves doing it. Right? So just don't do it! Librarians : I hate prophecy. But silver lining, Tyson's right. He just proved that it can be broken. It can be broken! The only way to break a prophecy is with a bigger prophecy, or if someone outside the prophecy intervenes. I guarantee you neither one of you saw Tyson in your vision. Tyson, I'm impressed. That was some excellent lateral thinking. The door with the Medusa head from my vision. Whoa, whoa, whoa. When I opened this door, I had a black eye. Something has to happen to me before I can open it. Who cares? No, listen. I was predestined to have a black eye. Show some respect for predestiny. Show a little respect for me not getting killed by that thing. (metallic scraping) Come on, open the door, Stone. Not until I get hit in the face. I'll hit you in the face. You're not my predestiny. You don't count. Are you sure? Are you sure? Wouldn't work on me. Part of being immortal, it seems, is that we can never tell what is to come. Okay, well, then, I guess there's only one way to find out who it's meant for. Show me what you got. The Oracle of Delphi shall die after she next bathes in the waters of Delphi. I, the Oracle of Delphi, prophesy my own demise. Oh! Oh! Oh! What did you see? The Oracle herself. She prophesied her own death. Wait, why would she prophesy her own death again? She can't control destiny. She can only interpret it. And this prophecy is crystal clear. Stone, I'll open the door. It's has to be me, okay? It's just... it's not time yet! (door creaking) (metallic scraping) Ah, you hear that sound? That is the sound of it being  time yet! (metallic scraping) (thunder rumbles) Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up, Stone! (metallic scraping) Please! Open the door! We don't have time for this. Uh, yeah, all right. It's heavy, back up. Tenga cuidado!  It's coming! Stone. It's just... I don't like cheating fate. Stone! All right! Oh, there's your black eye. Go, go! (ringing) Oh,  Que DIA! Almost out of time. No. You are not in the Library. That's why you're safe. That's why he hasn't attacked yet. Fingers crossed. Looks like we hit a dead end. There's no way out. Can't we just do the future, door-find-y thingy, and use the prophecy glass? What was prophecy glass? It's what the lenses in the goggles have become once... Nina? Why didn't you ask what prophecy glass is? Because you called it that already. No, I didn't. Not in front of you. None of us ever used that phrase in front of you, but you did. You said no one needs goggles made of prophecy glass to see that Principal Fairbrother loves his students. How do you know what prophecy glass is? I... well, I... And you said you were cleaning the pool when we fell in, but you weren't there. Yeah, and how come the rest of us have dried off, and you're still soaking wet? I just figured out who you are. You're the Oracle of Delphi. (stammers) Oh, I... I... (laughs) Well, I so enjoyed being poor little Nina. I'm sorry, Eve. I think you're simply marvelous. But as much as I love you, I love me more. And your time's almost up. But I'm not in the Library. Darling, you really should have done what old Galahad said and stayed put. The Library  was  the one safe place I couldn't reach you and then, you went and brought us all inside. What do you mean? This is a prophecy cube. My  prophecy cube. (silent) We've been in the Library all along. What do you mean, we're in your prophecy cube? My death, too, was foretold. After my next bath in the waters of Delphi. It's written her prophetic powers come from bathing daily at the rivers and lakes around her home. Yes, darling. And so, the only way to prevent my death was to create an even bigger prophecy to negate it. I'm your bigger prophecy? If only I'd stayed clear of the waters of Delphi I could have avoided all this. But destiny has a way of catching up with you. So you ran from Greece? To Seattle. What could be further away? I still had to bathe daily in sacred waters to maintain my power, but as long as they weren't the waters of Delphi, I would be just fine. You were the source of power in the lake water at Delphi. And since you're bathing in the high school swimming pool... I filled it with the powers of prophecy. That's why Jones got those weird readings by the pool. Your magic is in the water. That's why the goggles turned to prophecy glass. So because of Mrs. Mitrani, I won my trip to Mt. Parnassus? Yes, sweetheart! But do keep up. I'm  so  not Mrs. Mitrani. Wait, you came to Seattle. You got to go to Mt. Parnassus. What's in Mt. Parnassus? Delphi. Tyson brought Delphi water and he put it in the pool. So you ran all the way to Seattle and you still ended up in Delphi water? Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yes, thanks for that, Tyson. I had to stay in that pool for days waiting for you all to come. And I still am bathing, technically. As long as I remain wet, I don't die till bath time's over. But by then, Eve will be dead, and the power of your death will shatter this prophecy cube, and my destiny will be averted. I win again. You can't fight the Reaper, Eve. He must always have his kill. (blades clanging) You want a big death? How about a Librarian? Take me. Take me, too. Yeah. Two Librarians outweighs one Guardian any day! That's very noble. But two Librarians do not equal one Guardian. The death of a thousand Librarians would not equal this Guardian. What do you mean, "this Guardian"? You really have no idea how important you are, do you? The future you've got coming. Well, the future I'm going to steal from you. Oh, the energy your death will release, all that destiny denied. What have I got coming? Nothing. But had you lived... Oh, if Eve Baird had lived, she would've changed the fate of the Library forever. But instead, she will die here, so that I might live. Thank you for your sacrifice. No! We need her. I need her more. Two ways to break a self-fulfilling prophecy. One, you attach a bigger prophecy to the first. Yes, already did that. Two, find someone outside the prophecy to intervene. I have to die here in the Library. Jenkins, throw the blue cube out the back door! (Oracle laughing) Please! He can't hear you. Why does everyone always call for help? He's the world's oldest soldier. You think he needs to be able to hear me to understand what I'm saying? It's Morse code. Yes, it is. "Throw the blue cube..." What are you doing? What is that? Huh, a useless present, that's not so useless after all. "...to the other side of the world... Skippy." It's Colonel Baird. Grab the blue cube. Oh! Unh! (rumbling) (gasping) Throw! (all exclaiming) No! Sorry, Nina. Library's closed. No, you're just a mortal. You can't cheat fate! I didn't cheat fate. I cheated  you. But the Reaper must still have his kill, and, well, look at that, you're all dried off. Bath time's over. No...! It's empty! No. No, it's not fair! Ay, caramb... (whispers) Eve Baird... (rings) ...released. Yes! Yes, I did it. I won the day... with a makeup mirror! That's Uluru, and that's a kangaroo. Oh, my Lord. We're in... Australia! I'm home. But before someone asks me to "throw another shrimp on the barbie," just know I will punch you in the throat. Well, can't hang out long, "mate." You got a museum to donate to. Jenkins, I should've listened to you. I should've stayed put. Oh, well, seems to me you did just fine, Eve. After all, you are the Guardian. To the Guardian. To Baird. Thanks, guys! And thank you, Flynn, for this strange, inappropriate, and ultimately life-saving gift. Colonel, may I see that? This is not from Mr. Carson. This is Mimiko's mirror, a Japanese shaman queen. It is one of the Library's rarest relics. How did I end up with it? Well, you asked earlier if the Guardian guards the Librarians, who guards the Guardians, and there is your answer. The Library does. (taps) Hey, spot me a hundred. Why, you're just gonna...? I wanna hit the tables. You? You hitting the tables? Cassandra : We should go to a show...
