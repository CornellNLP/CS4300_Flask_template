  But things don't always go the way we hope, do they? 
  - For any of us. 
  - TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING SOFTLY IN SOMALI] 
  PASTOR: And they sure didn't over there. 
  [TRANSLATOR CONTINUES SOFTLY] 
  So all we can do now is to extend a hand in both directions. 
  Remember Romans: "We are all each other's brothers. 
  " Well, no one here has been more of a brother than Pop Merrill. 
  When he found out what happened in your country, he insisted we help find you a new home here in Maine. 
  And today, I am happy to announce Pop's offered spaces in his warehouse on Pine to any refugees looking to open their own business. 
  Pop.

  [DOOR CLUNKS, SLAMS] 
  CITIZEN: [ANGRILY] 
  You spent most of the budget on those ugly-ass witch scarecrows that caused that damn car crash. 
  Now you want us to give more for a parade? 
  PINTO: To celebrate the original founders of this town. 
  You all elected a new council to bring Castle Rock back to life.

  PINTO: Okay, um, this town has as much history - Ace been around? 
  - [PINTO CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] 
  - A few days ago, maybe. 
  - PINTO: Sure, we've had our dark moments. 
  But who hasn't? 
  We can use our past to help get started on our future. 
  For example, do you all have any idea what kind of Boston dollars Salem, Mass pulls in from all the witch groupies? 
  We had our own witches right here in Castle Rock, people. 
  They were Satanists, not witches. 
  Made a bad deal with the wrong hombre, those folks, and they burned for it. 
  We've been making bad deals with the wrong fella for a long, long time. 
  Pop, you okay? 
  POP: Call me if you see Ace.

  K'NAAN: Certain things fresh and certain things mish I got my own sound, I don't sound like the rest And not long ago I don't spoke English My point is police pull me over a lot They wonder what kind of rap sheet I got [TENSE MUSIC]

  I'm telling. 
  My nephew's missing. 
  And his dog, who has considerably better sense than him when I let him out this afternoon, he went right to your door. 
  Weird, right? 
  But the thing that confuses me most is you're paid up for another week, yet your bags are all packed. 
  Hmm?

  I thought he was gonna hurt us. 
  Or worse. 
  It's all right. 
  Go on. 
  Thank goodness he didn't stay. 
  What do you mean? 
  A car came into the parking lot, and and your nephew saw it and he he left my cabin and he ran off into the woods.
