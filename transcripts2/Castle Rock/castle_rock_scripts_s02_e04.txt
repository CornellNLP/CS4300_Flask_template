 You're not gonna hurt me. 
  You're gonna let me go right now, or I'm gonna tell Nadia the truth about you. 
  We both know you can't have that. 
  Seeing you in that white coat? 
  I could check out tomorrow knowing I done one good thing. 
  Let's save some time and cut through the bullshit. 
  I don't know what you're insinuating I'm not insinuating. 
  I'm telling. 
  My nephew's missing. 
  I killed a man, and then I took him to the pit and I threw him in the hole. 
  That's not even the worst of it. 
  He came back. 
  John Merrill. 
  John as in, uh, Ace Merrill? 
  He's coming for us now. 
  He's a very bad man. 
  And he's not gonna stop. 
  Thought you were dead, you f*cking moron! 
  The f*ck out of here! 
  The plan is, I don't let you out until you take your pills. 
  Mom! 
  Mom! 
  Joy, Joy, Joy, Joy! 
  Joy! 
  Nadia! 
  Nadia! 
  Right there. 
  Slow. 
  No house. 
  No house. 
  Abdi! 
  Nadia! 
  - She's got a weapon! 
  - Tell her to stop. 
  Nadia! 
  - Drop the weapon! 
  Drop it! 
  - Nadia! 
  - Stay down. 
  - She's down! 
  Keep open. 
  There could be more. 
  Castle Rock 2x04 Restore Hope Evening, neighbor. 
  Need a lift? 
  How's your mother? 
  She's she's fine. 
  Glad to hear it. 
  Let me give you a ride. 
  Uh, th-that that's my bus. 
  Ready? 
  - What? 
  - Saturday. 
  I can't, J. 
  With this whole Pop situation, it's a lot. 
  Come on, you canceled last week. 
  Apologies for being late, Pastor. 
  Long night. 
  Anything I can do? 
  Does the Bible say anything about how to stop a family from killing each other? 
  Yes, actually. 
  Anyway, sorry, in a bit of a rush today. 
  One fellow who needs a pneumonia check and her. 
  Joy? 
  The mother's own fudge are you doing? 
  Joy told me to get her sh1t. 
  Where is she? 
  - I don't know. 
  - Little liar. 
  This is all my fault. 
  I should have made sure that she was swallowing the pills. 
  You didn't cause any of this, Joy. 
  Sometimes it helps to feel like it's your fault because that means you've got control. 
  You think, "If I broke it, then I can fix it. 
  " I can. 
  I could just go back and and and be good like like before. 
  I need to talk to her! 
  Should have given her a phone, then. 
  You tell her that she needs to come home now! 
  You almost killed your own f*cking daughter last night! 
  No. 
  Look around you, lady. 
  Look at your f*cking face. 
  Can I stay with you? 
  Just until we figure everything out. 
  Please? 
  Joy, we either have to call the police or your mother. 
  - Where is she? 
  - She's at my house. 
  Look, it's better than a shelter. 
  She's safe. 
  She just wasn't ready to - Better with me than anywhere. 
  - She was covered in blood. 
  'Cause the sutures opened up. 
  Sit down, Anne. 
  Look, I don't know what yarn she's been spinning, but Joy's always had quite an imagination. 
  She told me you're running from her father. 
  Do you have full custody? 
  I don't know why I would have to explain to you to a woman why we had to run from a violent man. 
  If you and Joy are in danger We weren't until you decided to help. 
  She needs a stable home, and you need a specialist supervising your care. 
  Christmas. 
  And I can't let you back at the hospital. 
  I'm sorry, Anne. 
  Anne? 
  Joy! 
  Come out here immediately! 
  Get the f*ck out of here. 
  I am here for my daughter. 
  She says she's not going. 
  - Her words. 
  - Please Woman, she told us what you did! 
  Do not come back here. 
  Joy! 
  Joy! 
  Joy! 
  All right, let's just f*cking play. 
  All right. 
  He can't hurt me, Pop. 
  Little homemade video here. 
  Oh, so cute, so cute. 
  Look at you guys. 
  They don't play baseball in Somalia, do they? 
  Throw it to me! 
  Okay. 
  Okay. 
  What's your problem? 
  Everyone puts a card down, and whoever has the highest card takes all the cards that are there. 
  And whoever with the most cards at the end wins. 
  You got it? 
  How much are we playing for? 
  The f*ck are you doing? 
  - What, are you still high? 
  - Yeah. 
  Just reflecting. 
  Those two shit-buckets are waiting for you. 
  They're out there talking about shooting up Somalis thanks to you. 
  Something really bad almost happened. 
  To Abdi, to Pop. 
  sh1t even you wouldn't be able to live with. 
  I don't know. 
  I find I can live with a lot. 
  Turn that sh1t off. 
  It's f*cking creepy. 
  Come on! 
  Stop that. 
  Stop that, come on. 
  Wheelchair, lobby for assist. 
  Wheelchair to lobby for assist. 
  Inanta, I, uh I got some bad instincts when it comes to your brother. 
  I know that. 
  I made a big mistake. 
  And I want to get square with you, and I'll do whatever Your blood results came back. 
  The chemo hasn't given us the outcome we had hoped for. 
  Okay. 
  So what you're saying is, we're done. 
  That's not what I'm saying. 
  There are dozens of new therapies. 
  - Bone marrow transplants - Nah, Nadia. 
  Immunotherapy, clinical trials. 
  Yeah, well, maybe I don't want to fight it. 
  You see, that's not how this works. 
  I came back to fix you. 
  You tried. 
  And now you're gonna try. 
  You owe me that. 
  Your PD-1 inhibitor trial sounds promising. 
  I was hoping he might be a candidate. 
  He's not showing up in the system. 
  Is it M-E-R-R-I-L-L? 
  I don't think he's used the Veterans Health system before. 
  Ever? 
  How long's he been out? 
  A while. 
  Sergeant Major Merrill served in Iraq and, uh, well, he doesn't like to talk about it, you know? 
  Hmm, he serve anywhere else? 
  Afghanistan, I think. 
  But he's not exactly the most patriotic veteran. 
  No offense. 
  I know how you guys can get. 
  None taken. 
  What makes you think he wants to join the study? 
  Look, if you can get him in, then I can convince him. 
  Thank you, Doctor. 
  Abdi Howlwadaag. 
  - How are you holding up? 
  - Not great. 
  Come get worse. 
  Mm. 
  I actually thought about stopping by the church this morning. 
  Pop doesn't need thoughts and prayers. 
  I need you to work on him for me. 
  Get him back in the fight. 
  I just can't imagine I mean, he could really just be not here. 
  Not not at the store, not anywhere. 
  And it will be my fault. 
  Come on, Nadia. 
  Just like Mom. 
  Your mom? 
  It's true. 
  You were just a kid. 
  I, um, walked out like I was in a dream. 
  Walked right into a war. 
  I couldn't save her. 
  But this, this I can do if he'd just f*cking let me. 
  I'll work on him. 
  So what can I do for you, Mr. 
  Merrill? 
  Say a man has something on his books something bad and he can't shift it; he can't pay it off. 
  It's written in blood just soaked right through the page. 
  It's eating at his f*cking liver faster than the cancer. 
  And the only way to make it stop is to tell the person he did it to 'cause she don't even know. 
  So Should he do it? 
  Should he tell her? 
  I guess I'd have to ask Why is he confessing to her and not God? 
  And then I'd ask, "What's it cost?" Well, he's in a unique position to pay anything, being he's doomed and all. 
  No, her. 
  The person he's confessing to, what's the confession cost her? 
  Let's have a couple Jamesons. 
  Will do. 
  We're shutting the Tiger tomorrow, open to close. 
  Private event. 
  Okay. 
  Tell Heather to pull the best slosh we got, and get word to any happy asshole that might want to tie one on at 4 o'clock on a Sunday. 
  Customers, tenants, the f*cking pope. 
  We having a party? 
  A wake. 
  A big, sloppy Irish wake. 
  For? 
  You got another round of chemo coming. 
  Yeah, last round bought me, what, few weeks? 
  Pissing into the wind, son. 
  I'm in f*cking overtime. 
  Pop, don't It's okay, Chrissy. 
  Is, uh, Joy here? 
  Oh, she's she's cool. 
  So, um, did you did you see her? 
  - Yes. 
  - Did she see you? 
  No, she didn't see me take it. 
  What'll happen when she realizes it's gone? 
  I don't know. 
  Do you know the combo? 
  It's probably, like, my birthday or something, right? 
  Um, thank you for doing all this. 
  Eh, it's no problem. 
  I put more minutes on that phone. 
  Better use them to call me. 
  I put some of your clothes in there too. 
  Hmm. 
  My birthday. 
  Mom's birthday? 
  Christmas, Joy. 
  Christmas, Joy. 
  - Let us alone. 
  - Oh, scared, huh? 
  Afraid, huh? 
  How long can you stay fresh in that can? 
  Come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard. 
  Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay! 
  Now, that's getting personal, Lion. 
  Yes, get up and teach him a lesson. 
  Well, what's wrong with you teaching him? 
  Uh, well well, I hardly know him. 
  Well, I'll get you, anyway, peewee No! 
  It's Tom Heiden from the Veterans Health Administration. 
  Got good news about the PD-1 trial. 
  One of our Iraqi vets has dropped out, so a spot has opened up. 
  We would need Sergeant Major Merrill's DD214 discharge. 
  If you don't have it, you can request it from the army archives. 
  Of course, that could take months, and obviously, time is of the essence. 
  Anyway, if you can get the document, we can get him in the study. 
  Pop? 
  Ace? 
  Jesus. 
  What are you doing here? 
  What are you doing here, Lance? 
  Oh, I'm making Ace's deposits. 
  Uh, well, I'm trying to save Pop's f*cking life. 
  Let's call it a night. 
  We got a f*cking message for your brother. 
  Take your f*cking hands off me! 
  Careful with that thing, sweetie. 
  Yeah. 
 
 
 
  Do you even know how to use it? 
  Bitch! 
  Move. 
  Move it. 
  This bitch grew up here. 
  Ho, ro, the rattlin' bog The bog down in the valley-o Timothy, Timothy, Timothy. 
  Whatcha doing? 
  Scamming some beers for your friends out in the parking lot? 
  I'm sorry, Mr. 
  Merrill. 
  What are you sorry about? 
  Any of those kids under 14? 
  No. 
  Then take some more beer. 
  Now, get the f*ck out of here. 
  Thank you, Mr. 
  Merrill. 
  Down in the valley-o On that tree, there was a limb, rare limb I imagined something simpler for you. 
  Tree in the hole and the hole in the bog And the bog down in the valley-o Pine box, maybe. 
  What the f*ck are you doing here? 
  - I could leave if you want. 
  - Okay. 
  I just wanted to tell you, after you're really gone I won't make any more trouble with Abdi. 
  You do realize it's not brain cancer I got, right? 
  And the bog down in the valley-o Red wine. 
  He gonna control himself for one goddamn night? 
  Ho, ro, the rattlin' bog The bog down in the valley-o Ho, ro, the rattlin' bog Down in the valley-o On that tree, there was a limb Rare limb, a rattlin' limb Limb on the tree and the tree in the hole And the hole in the bog And the bog down in the valley-o The limb And the limb on the tree And the tree in the hole And the hole in the bog And the bog down in the valley-o On that eye there was a stye Rare stye, a rattlin' stye Stye in the eye and the eye in the flea And the flea in the feather and the feather in the bird And the bird in the egg and the egg in the nest And the nest in the tree In the tree down in the valley-o Ho, ro, the rattlin' bog The bog down in the valley-o Ho, ro, the rattlin' bog Down in the valley-o Hey, let's, uh, give it up for the band. 
  It's it's the best I could find on short notice. 
  Oh, Chris. 
  Uh, Councilwoman Pinto, all you other nobodies from The Lot and The Rock, I, uh, I appreciate you taking a moment out of your schedules to come celebrate. 
  We all know him as Pop but to, uh to me and my brother, he he really is Pop. 
  He's our Pop. 
  Now, some of us feel this is a bit premature - Ah. 
  Okay. 
  - And ah, here he comes. 
  Enough of this weepy horseshit. 
  I love you, Chris, but you want a thing done right, you gotta do it yourself, so here goes. 
  Uh, Reginald Marion Merrill Known as Pop to his friends, enemies, and various other miscreants Passed away this week, much to the delight of damn near everyone. 
  Pop loan-sharked every sucker that got himself into a jam and and hawked every manner of gewgaw and doodad to unsuspecting chumps at the Emporium Galorium. 
  Caveat emptor. 
  That's the sign that sits on the counter. 
  It's Latin. 
  It means, "You've just been cheated by the biggest son of a bitch in southern Maine. 
  " Although Pop had no children of his own, he raised his sister Brenda's kids, Chris and John, and because of Pop's diligent parenting, those two young men grew into the abject piece of sh1t and the dimwitted boob you know today. 
  I'll let you figure out which one is which. 
  Pop also fostered two kids from Somalia Which was probably the only decent thing Pop did in his otherwise beshitted life. 
  No, not not decent, no. 
  It wasn't decency. 
  It was just a debt. 
  Just another goddamn debt to be settled. 
  But it can't be settled. 
  It it can't be it can't be settled. 
  Hey, Pop, you okay? 
  Uh Thanks for coming. 
  Uh, just uh, just keep drinking, everyone. 
  - Yeah. 
  - All right. 
  - Okay. 
  - Pop! 
  Hey. 
  You left your jacket at my place. 
  Wanna pick it up later? 
  Did you know? 
  Know what? 
  Nadia. 
  Hey, did you say something to her? 
  About? 
  Look, I know your peace pipe routine is f*cking bullshit, okay? 
  But don't bring her into whatever it is you're running on Abdi. 
  I'm just trying to grant a dying man's final wish. 
  Please. 
  What's it gonna take to convince you that I've changed, brother? 
  Stop being so f*cking weird. 
  All right. 
  There is something else going on. 
  I f*cking knew it. 
  But it's not like anything you're thinking. 
  Come on, I'll show you. 
  Church? 
  So, what, you found Jesus? 
  You might say I've had a conversion of sorts. 
  Did you know that 400 years ago Jerusalem's Lot was called New Jerusalem? 
  New Jerusalem was settled by a very special group of people. 
  Easy, Madam Councilwoman, I got you. 
  In many ways, this land - Watch your head. 
  - You might say There you go. 
  Is still theirs. 
  They were brave souls who fought enemies from east and west Are you high right now? 
  To defend the land that they were promised. 
  Dude, what is with the f*cking history lesson? 
  They never surrendered, and they never will surrender. 
  Honestly, man, what the f*ck are you talking about? 
  Come on. 
  Come. 
  So you drag me all the way down here to tell me you're joining AA? 
  No, not AA. 
  But I am creating a kind of fellowship. 
  Wanna join? 
  What the f*ck? 
  Help me! 
  Help! 
  Chris? 
  Please. 
  Please help me. 
  Don't move. 
  I'll call an ambulance. 
  Father? 
  They need to hurry. 
  It's real bad. 
  We'll make you good as new, son. 
  First set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone As she wheeled her wheelbarrow Through streets broad and narrow Crying, "Cockles and mussels alive, alive, oh" "Alive, alive, oh Alive, alive, oh" Crying, "Cockles" If anyone can bring me back to life "Alive, alive, oh" It's you, but I'm I'm done, Inanta. 
  I'm done getting poked. 
  I'm done getting poisoned. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I needed your discharge papers to get you in the VA trial. 
  Took me forever to find them. 
  Almost as if you didn't want them to be found. 
  Your ERB was there too. 
  All the places you fought overseas. 
  Iraq, Afghanistan. 
  Those, you had stories about. 
  But there's one that you left out. 
  Nadia You were there. 
  Mogadishu, 1993. 
  It was, uh It was a classified mission, and, uh I always wondered why you wanted us. 
  - Why you went to the trouble. 
  - Inanta. 
  You didn't want to foster just any Somali kids You wanted us, Abdi and me. 
  Yeah. 
  Yes, I did. 
  Why? 
  Because it was you. 
  She's got a gun! 
  Abdi! 
  Abdi, Nadia! 
  "Alive, alive, oh" Crying, "Cockles and mussels alive, alive, oh" "Alive, alive, oh Alive, alive, oh" Crying, "Cockles and mussels alive, alive, oh" It was you. 
  Inanta Don't call me that, ever. 
  You f*ck!
