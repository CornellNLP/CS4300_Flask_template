 Nadia, I'm sorry. 
  I could never make it right. 
  There's no forgiving it. 
  Don't blame Abdi. 
  This is my fault. 
  He was just trying to protect you. 
  - You and Pop? 
  - What the hell? 
  How could you know something like that and not tell me? 
  Nadia, come on. 
  Did you know that 400 years ago, Jerusalem's Lot was called New Jerusalem? 
  New Jerusalem was settled by a very special group of people. 
  In many ways, this land Is still theirs. 
  They never surrendered, and they never will surrender. 
  It's all happening exactly as Amity said it would. 
  We had our own witches right here in Castle Rock, people. 
  They were Satanists, not witches. 
  Made a bad deal with the wrong hombre, those folks. 
  They burned for it. 
  Annie. 
  Amen. 
  Non, non, Marius. 
  Amity. 
  All right, bring it in, guys. 
  Volunteers, team leaders, gather round, gather round. 
  I want to thank you all for coming out to volunteer for our 400th anniversary. 
  Now, the event is gonna start at 3:00 sharp, and it should take us about two hours to get the parade down Route 9. 
  We will conclude in front of the church in Castle Rock, where we will kick off four days of festivities leading up to the 400th anniversary. 
  We, uh still aren't taking her in? 
  Sit tight, Rook. 
  Deputy, here's the thing. 
  I don't want a lawyer. 
  I did it. 
  That's the story, soup to nuts. 
  - So this is a - Confession, yes, sir. 
  She broke into my room, trying to rob me. 
  She had a gun. 
  I did what I had to do. 
  The end. 
  I wanna talk to my daughter! 
  These yours? 
  Yeah, so what? 
  Why don't you walk me through it? 
  It's not that complicated. 
  She attacked me. 
  I killed her. 
  Uh-huh, and where does the syringe come into it? 
  I'm a nurse. 
  You used the syringe on the victim first? 
  There you go. 
  So I dust the syringe, your prints I'll find? 
  A lot of people touched that syringe. 
  That's the nature of hospital work. 
  I'm a nurse, see? 
  Ms. 
  Ingalls, did you know the deceased? 
  Not until she broke into my room. 
  'Cause we got her phone. 
  There's a call. 
  Maine number. 
  She got it in New York. 
  Nearest we figure, she hightailed it here right after she received the call. 
  Why? 
  I don't know why a crazy woman does what she does. 
  I don't know, and I don't care. 
  I care about my daughter. 
  What's gonna happen to her? 
  Little love! 
  Oh! 
  Oh, I don't know why those yokels are keeping us here all night, but whatever they're trying to get you to say, don't. 
  Don't say a word. 
  Joy, you saved me out there. 
  You shouldn't have. 
  I didn't deserve it. 
  For now why don't you just let me do the saving for a change, okay? 
  Okay, it's gonna be all right, little love. 
  I'll get you clear of this. 
  - Let's go. 
  - Where? 
  - Now, both of you. 
  - The police station? 
  She's a minor, and she's got nothing to do with this! 
  John. 
  How much longer you got? 
  Quite a grapevine they got in this shithole. 
  The king is dead. 
  That's a big headline for a small town. 
  Welcome back, by the way. 
  It's good to be back. 
  Portland, State, I've done the grand tour. 
  It's nice they brought us home. 
  Weeks. 
  What? 
  You asked how long I got. 
  Weeks? 
  Damn. 
  Well, I got uh, let's see - Life. 
  - Huh. 
  Looks like we're gonna just miss you, John. 
  What a shame. 
  So what the f*ck are you doing here, Reggie? 
  I was telling a war story the other day. 
  I thought of you. 
  Yeah, real soldiers don't tell war stories. 
  We both know that. 
  Real soldiers know that nobody wants to f*cking hear them. 
  Yeah, and then real soldiers come home from the bar and pop their wives a good one in the head, right? 
  - There it is. 
  - Hit them so hard, they don't get up? 
  Yeah, what do you want me to say, Reg? 
  That what real soldiers do, John? 
  You're spending your last breath telling me I'm a piece of sh1t? 
  I regret to inform you, that news has beat you here. 
  My life ended 30 years ago. 
  Both my boys got your name. 
  Not mine. 
  You think I don't know what I am? 
  You think I ain't had time to think about this? 
  You know who ain't had the time? 
  My sister. 
  Maybe if you'd told one more f*cking war story and had one less f*cking case of beer, Brenda'd still be alive. 
  30 years and here you are with all the answers. 
  Is that why you came? 
  I came here to forgive you. 
  What bullshit is this, Reg? 
  It's the truth. 
  Forgiveness? 
  That don't wash. 
  Everyone deserves forgiveness, even you. 
  I forgive you. 
  What the f*ck is really going on, Reg? 
  You swing in here acting like the f*cking pope two days after my own son's sitting across from me for the first time in two decades - Chris was here? 
  - Ace. 
  I barely recognized him. 
  Come on, Reg. 
  What the f*ck gives? 
  My fuckup nephew come in here? 
  Hey, Jimmy. 
  Remember who you're talking to. 
  I figured he couldn't hurt anything down there 'cause there's nothing left to hurt. 
  Nothing left to hurt down where? 
  Old Warden Lacy's hole, where he kept that gimp. 
  Block F. 
  What the f*ck do they's want down in F? 
  They gave me a hundred reasons not to ask. 
  They just kinda looked around. 
  Guess they wanted to know where it went down. 
  That cage is still in the tank. 
  They never took it down. 
  But the really weird thing was Spit it out, boy. 
  The sh1t's locked. 
  There were, like, a pile of clothes inside. 
  Sweats, you know? 
  Prison-issue. 
  What? 
  I hear Ace is making all the stops. 
  I mean, Block F? 
  Marsten place? 
  You mean Marsten's house? 
  That boy must be up to something. 
  He's always got an angle, you know? 
  Merci, ma prophÃ¨te. 
  Pop. 
  You wanna tell me what you're doing in this f*cking place? 
  We're a group of like-minded individuals fostering accord between two communities, Castle Rock and Salem's Lot, all on the eve of our 400th anniversary. 
  Are you going to the parade? 
  Do you know the history of this shithole? 
  History does not define a thing, Pop. 
  You of all people should know that. 
  You better start explaining. 
  You have questions. 
  I get it. 
  You get it? 
  Maybe you can help me get it, Ace. 
  Help me get what the f*ck you were doing over at the prison. 
  Help me get what you're doing here. 
  I've had some revelations about myself, the kind of life I've led. 
  Turns out I wasn't alone. 
  I'm not buying it, Ace. 
 
 
 
  You, Hassan, bunch of townies, f*cking Rainbow Coalition. 
  What the f*ck is going on here? 
  What the f*ck were you doing at the prison paying off guards, trying to get into Block F? 
  I don't know what you mean. 
  You should go, Pop. 
  My friends don't want you in their house. 
  I gotta talk to you. 
  You told Nadia? 
  That feel good? 
  Getting it all off your chest? 
  She figured it out on her own. 
  Well, now she won't talk to me either. 
  Is there anything you can't f*ck up? 
  Now, get out, Pop. 
  I'm done with your sh1t. 
  You gotta watch your back, Abdi. 
  You're here to threaten me again? 
  I'm warning you about Ace. 
  - A little late for that. 
  - And your man. 
  The big one, Hassan? 
  - They're working together. 
  - Bullshit. 
  I seen them together up at Marsten. 
  - Hassan? 
  - Not just them either. 
  Cops, the goddamn city councilwoman, all listening to f*cking Ace? 
  Something's wrong. 
  Something bad is coming. 
  Listen to me. 
  I'm old enough to remember things you can't even f*cking imagine. 
  And I'm old enough to remember that a f*cking week ago, I was tied to a f*cking chair. 
  Stay away from me and my family. 
  Nearly all 38 of us have our new vessels. 
  Soon our prophet will return. 
  Tomorrow the final steps begin. 
  We'll do it here, where the most people will be gathered, before their temple to their false God. 
  The police have the vessel. 
  Ms. Wilkes. 
  - Patrice. 
  - What? 
  The prophet's vessel. 
  She's gotten herself into some trouble. 
  She just became your responsibility. 
  Non, non, non! 
  Amity! 
  Aidez-moi! 
  Mon Dieu! 
  You didn't bring her. 
  She's at the station and it's gonna take some time. 
  But, Augustin, her head's swimming with the same evil medicines as this one. 
  Antipsychotics. 
  We almost lost Helene. 
  We could lose the prophet too. 
  It's not a problem now that we know. 
  We'll sober her, clear the fog. 
  There isn't time for that. 
  Augustin, please, we didn't know about these mind-altering chemicals, nor did the prophet. 
  She brought me back. 
  The Wilkes woman brought all of us back. 
  You're seeing signs where there are none. 
  And what signs do you see, Patrice? 
  What vessel is suitable? 
  Clearly you have the gift of sight. 
  The angel has touched you. 
  Show us the proper vessel. 
  Castle Rock's 400th anniversary parade has begun! 
  Here she comes, folks! 
  The Witch of Jerusalem's Lot. 
  Give yourselves a hand for coming out today, celebrating 400 years of beauty. 
  Now let's all give a big, warm Castle Rock welcome to the brothers and sisters of Jerusalem's Lot! 
  I haven't seen a crowd this big since the 1992 Thanksgiving Day! 
  Let's hear it for Castle Rock! 
  Look at that car. 
  What the f*ck? 
  Any trouble so far? 
  Oh, no. 
  All's well. 
  I can let you through if you need to get to the emporium. 
  No, I'm gonna take a look. 
  Hey, folks, please welcome Castle Rock's very own Pastor Drew. 
  I'm glad you could make it. 
  Good afternoon, good afternoon. 
  I see a lot of my parishioners out there. 
  We thank you for coming. 
  We are so thankful. 
  We want to share our gratitude with you with a gift. 
  Ace. 
  A blessing that will unify all of us. 
  What the f*ck are you doing, Ace? 
  - Excuse me, sir! 
  - Hey, where you going, Pop? 
  - Something bad is coming! 
  - Step back. 
  - What are you up to? 
  - Come on. 
  Get off me! 
  Get off! 
  Let me tell you a story about starting over. 
  Someone once said that every good story ends where it begins. 
  Well, this one begins right here in Castle Rock, and it will end here too. 
  Bad Robot.
