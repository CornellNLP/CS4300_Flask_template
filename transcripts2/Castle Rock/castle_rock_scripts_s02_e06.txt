  It's been four years since I stopped using drugs and alcohol [SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

  It was a big story especially back in California which is why I came here. 
  I wanted to start again. 
  I didn't want to be a part of that story anymore. 
  And it's funny because stories used to be my life, my job. 
  I was gonna teach the classics, show young minds how stories shape our world. 
  And then someone pulled me into her story Not my baby! 
  No! 
  No! 
  And shaped my world.

  I'm not I'm not normal, Joy. 
  There's a whole lot wrong with me and very little right, but the thing that keeps me on the right side of the double yellow line is knowing how to love one thing, and that's you.

  RITA: You know what the hardest part was? 
  Hoping that you were a good mom. 
  Because the other option was she's dead. 
  Rita, I RITA: It was the dedication, wasn't it? 
  [DARK MUSIC] 
  You could handle the affair. 
  You could even handle the baby. 
  But when he dedicated his book to me. . 
  It made you feel small, didn't it? 
  I was small. 
  [INSECTS CHIRPING] 
  "Little love, if you're reading this, then by now, you know the truth about Bakersfield or her version of the truth, anyway. 
  But there's another truth that you need to know. 
  Not about the past. 
  That's done. 
  This is about always, whether we're lost to each other forever or just for a little while. 
  I'll always remember how you sing every Carly Simon song a little flat and I sing it a little bit sharp, and we even each other out that way. 
  I don't know what the future holds for you and me, but no matter what happens, I will be grateful to the very end for every second I've been able to spend with you. 
  You are my life, and no matter where you are, I will always be your number one fan".
