 - Where is he? 
  - Who? 
  - My father. 
  - They moved him to a yard up in Bangor by the airport. 
  Did she even know what she was signing for? 
  What else you been signing for her, Alan? 
  Oh! 
  The sheets! 
  Your mom's been leaving food out for the neighborhood mutt. 
  We buried it New Year's Day. 
  Truck. 
  It's like I open the book and all the pages, someone tore them out - Mom! 
  - and rearranged them. 
  I bought her a ring in '91. 
  Eventually I moved back. 
  Then I get a phone call. 
  Somebody heard gunfire up at your mom's place. 
  - Gunfire? 
  - Your mother came to the door, threw her arms around me, begged me, ''Don't leave!'' If I tell you something, can you keep your mouth shut? 
  Life used to go in one direction, - but somehow I got off it. 
  - Ruthie? 
  The neurologist said, ''Find a coping mechanism'', and I have. 
  One for every room in the house. 
  Damn it! 
  You're back. 
  Ruth! 
  Ruthie?! 
  Ruthie! 
  Lady on the internet says they were made by Vikings, - so I figured - Oh! 
  The Lewis chessmen. 
  You know, the originals, they were carved out of walrus ivory by the wife of a priest Margaret the Adroit. 
  You are still the smartest person I know. 
  Smart enough to know what you're up to. 
  Come on. 
  No, come on, this way. 
  What else did the internet teach you? 
  That chess is good for the demented brain? 
  We got any champagne around this house? 
  Here's one more last-minute resolution. 
  When you're on the road today, you'll wanna steer clear of the turnpike from Portland to Augusta. 
  Where did you run off to? 
  I splurged $30 Japanese steaks. 
  - What is it? 
  - Aw, nothin'. 
  Be back in two shakes. 
  Set up those chessmen. 
  I'll let you slaughter me after dinner. 
  Ruthie, wait in the house. 
  Did you call the veterin The clinic? 
  On South Reserve? 
  He doesn't need a vet. 
  SOB came outta nowhere. 
  She. 
  Ma'am? 
  She's not a son of a bitch. 
  She's a bitch. 
  We goin' somewhere? 
  It's for Puck. 
  Puck was your boy's dog. 
  Used to leave dead squirrels on your pillow like hotel mints, remember? 
  That dog out there is just a neighborhood stray. 
  I know that. 
  Did I ever tell you about what happened to Puck? 
  I came home one day, and she was just gone. 
  Matthew said she she must have run off. 
  But I found a box of poison in the trash. 
  You have no idea. 
  - What? 
  - What he was capable of. 
  I used to see turkey vultures wheeling around the sky out back over the woods, but I was too chickenshit to go look. 
  The thought of her being picked apart, no one to bury her. 
  And you think buryin' one dog pays the debt on the other. 
  Puck. 
  They can't do that without our permission. 
  Your mother gave it. 
  And nobody thought to pick up the phone and call me? 
  Did she even know what she was signing for? 
  You signed for her. 
  I deposited the distress settlement for her, too. 
  What else you been signing for her, Alan? 
  Oh! 
  The sheets! 
  Okay, dear. 
  Almost done. 
  A few minutes ago I read a list of words and asked you to repeat them. 
  Can you repeat them back to me now? 
  Any order you like. 
  Someone sent you flowers. 
  The mouse ran up the - No hints. 
  - Just give her one and it'll all come back. 
  Please, sir. 
  If you wouldn't mind just waiting outside? 
  Yeah, I would mind. 
  ''Dear''? 
  Do you know how f*cking condescending that sounds? 
  She has a brain the size of Portland. 
  But it's sick, Alan. 
  Alzheimer's. 
  Why won't anyone use that that word? 
  There's no diagnostic test for Alzheimer's. 
  Confirmation's made postmortem by examining the brain for plaques and other hallmarks. 
  Postmortem? 
  Let's get the f*ck out of here. 
  We're going to Darden. 
  Doesn't matter what we call it. 
  These things move in one direction. 
  Higher-order functions become more challenging. 
  Your ability to exercise reason and judgment finances, drive a car planning and problem-solving confusion with time and space Confusion with time and space. 
  She slips up. 
  And reading and the face of my own son. 
  We can medicate the anxiety and help you develop systems, coping mechanisms. 
  But given the accident, I think it's time to consider other living arrangements. 
  Listen that brain doctor, I don't care how many degrees she's got on her f*ckin' wall Don't make me wash your mouth out. 
  I knocked on that door after 14 years. 
  You remember what you said? 
  ''Don't leave. 
  '' See? 
  It's all still up there. 
  Listen, after I get you settled, I got some business to take care of, and when I come back, I'm not going anywhere, and neither are you. 
  We're gonna fix you up as good as new. 
  Yeah, I just I just need a system, that's all. 
  ''They will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them. 
  I refuse, said the man. 
  How can I bring myself to abandon my own children alone in the woods? 
  Wild animals would tear them to pieces. 
  '' ''Oh, you fool, said the wife. 
  Then all four of us will starve. 
  The clever boy filled his jacket pockets with pebbles, as many as he could fit. 
  He would use the stones to lay a trail through the forest'' Older then he was when? 
  Ever. 
  Is that why you're here? 
  I was I was thinkin' about when you turned seven. 
  Made a big batch of that buttercream frosting. 
  That was before we knew about your lactose thing. 
  I never seen a cake disappear and reappear that fast. 
  You probably don't remember that. 
  Magic 101. 
  This is called the French Drop. 
  This is called palming. 
  Either holding it with the creases of your palm, or what I prefer to do is to do a thumb palm. 
  Why do all magic tricks sound pornographic? 
  I don't know, 'cause they're invented by virgins. 
  Here, you try. 
  Give it a shot. 
  Go ahead. 
  Stick your that's it, you sell it with your thumb, then just drop it down gently there Great. 
  Great. 
  Yeah! 
  You got it. 
  You got the French Drop. 
  Now all you gotta work on is palming! 
  No palming! 
  Mom? 
  Picked up a hitchhiker. 
  Oh! 
  Come over here and give me a hug. 
  Oh, look at you. 
  Look at you. 
  How old is this turkey? 
  So they dug him up just to stick him back in the ground again? 
  Is that a thing up here? 
  Ask your father. 
  ''Behold, I will tell you a mystery. 
  Not all will sleep, but all will be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised, imperishable, and we will all be changed. 
  For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. 
  But when this perishable put on the imperishable, and this mortal put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written: ''Death is swallowed up in victory. 
  '' Hymn 114. 
  ''O God Our Help in Ages Past. 
  '' O God our help in ages past Our hope for years to come Our shelter ''Swallowed up in victory. 
  '' Hardcore. 
  Mom, I have got lunch under control. 
  You should stay off your feet. 
  I thought you were the only one there. 
  - Who are all the programs for? 
  - The church printed 'em up. 
  They're gonna have some recycling to do. 
  I'm serious, Mom, it's turkey and bread. 
  Well, you better make his a double. 
  You want to be an astronaut, you're gonna need meat on your bones. 
  We're past that. 
  These days he's all about graphic design. 
  I coulda sworn we buried him in that suit. 
  Buried who? 
  Your father. 
  help you out, get you back on your feet. 
  - The blanket. 
  - I made tuna fish salad. 
  You can say grace. 
  We'll let the woods say grace today. 
  Come on. 
  Sit. 
  Sit. 
  What is that? 
  Matthew. 
  I've had a beautiful experience, and I want to share it with you. 
  Do you know what the Psalms say about taking your own life? 
  - Matthew. 
  - He's fine. 
  It's stealing. 
  Because your life belongs to God. 
  There was a Japanese solider. 
  World War II. 
  His masters tell him, ''Whatever happens, don't surrender. 
  Don't. 
  Take your own life. 
  '' So he hides out on an island in the Philippines. 
  Leaflets fall from the sky telling him the war is over. 
  The Empire's dead. 
  His masters are dead. 
  But he doesn't believe 'em. 
  He kept fighting FDR until 1974. 
  Let's go home. 
  I have chicken in the fridge. 
  You look at this town, the suffering, you wonder where was God? 
  Maybe the leaflets fell from the sky but you didn't believe them. 
  So I took a drive to the Walmart in Farmington, and I took a walk here in the woods where no one would have to clean it up, and I told God that I couldn't live without proof. 
  Then I fit the end into my ear like this Matthew. 
  and I heard it. 
  What? 
  God. 
  His voice. 
  I think we should call Dr. 
  Pierce. 
  This has nothing to do with Dr. 
  Pierce. 
  He scraped all that out of me. 
  I'm healthy. 
  Just for a scan. 
  God helps those who help themselves. 
  They said, ''Watch out for symptoms. 
  '' - Headaches. 
  Ringing in the ears - This wasn't a ringing. 
  Saul heard it on the road to Damascus, knocked him flat on his back, when he got up again, he wasn't Saul. 
  He was Paul. 
  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 
  I can hear it now. 
  Can you? 
  No. 
  We'll just sit here and be quiet. 
  It's a work thing. 
  You two okay for a couple hours? 
  We're good. 
  Front door open. 
  So what's the deal with all the missing pieces? 
  Grandma? 
  You're not having a stroke, are you? 
  If I tell you something can you keep your mouth shut? 
  See, I can get lost in the past. 
  These are my breadcrumbs. 
  If I find a chess piece in the icebox, well, I know it's now, not then. 
  That I can find my way out of the woods. 
  Huh You think your grandma's a fruitcake. 
  No. 
  You're a Timewalker. 
  Have you never heard of Catacomb Drifter or D For Destiny? 
  Um, there's twelve levels, I mean, for now. 
  You know, they keep adding expansion packs. 
  Oh, sh1t! 
  Got it. 
  How do you win? 
  It's not a game, exactly. 
  It never ends. 
  Anyway, Timewalkers are the most powerful 'cause they're the only avatars that can actually kill the dead. 
  The dead, they're everywhere. 
  See? 
  Ha! 
  And you know, they're pissed off, because we're alive and they're not. 
  You gotta stay sharp, because they can change their skin, and sometimes even look like your allies. 
  Look, there goes another one. 
  See, what makes it so hard is that no one stays dead when you kill them unless you're a Timewalker. 
  Theoretically, you could just kill your nemesis and fix the whole timeline. 
  But you gotta stay sharp. 
  Back door open. 
  You're back. 
  Go to bed, Ruth. 
  But a trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised, imperishable, and we will all and this mortal must put on immortality. 
  Once again, reporting a suspected arson at Juniper Hills Hospital, with 14 confirmed dead. 
  The suspect considered dangerous. 
  Police have released a photo, but not a name. 
  You can see the smoke billowing from the rooftop Matthew. 
  Are you living or dead? 
  Oh, long dead. 
  Ancient history. 
  What's your name? 
  The badass avenger chick from GÃ­sla Saga. 
  Uh - Thordis! 
  - Oh! 
  You are your mother's son. 
  Ah, okay. 
  Got one. 
  Okay. 
  Who are you? 
  I'm smaller than a teacup. 
  Mmm. 
  Smaller than a teacup Did you say your prayers? 
  Yeah. 
  Did you? 
  Good man. 
  He's a little old for that, isn't he? 
  Watching you take a bath? 
  Oh, he wasn't. 
  I'm his mother. 
  He's not blood. 
  It's different. 
  What did you do with the gun? 
  I don't want it in the house. 
  God helps those who help themselves. 
  Can't rely on the sheriff to keep our family safe. 
  - Matthew. 
  - Top drawer in the dresser. 
  And before you tell me it's irresponsible, the bullets are locked away. 
  He'll never find them. 
  Theoretically, you could just kill your nemesis, fix the whole timeline. 
  The bullets are locked away. 
  He'll never find them. 
  - Is Henry here? 
  - No. 
  Mrs. 
  Deaver! 
  I think he's he's lost. 
  Or in trouble. 
  I need to find him. 
  Front door open. 
  When are we? 
  Okay, Mrs. 
  Deaver, it's important. 
  I think that something terrible is going to happen. 
  It's happened. 
  I saw you in my bedroom. 
  You were just a little girl. 
  I'm sorry. 
  - I'm so sorry. 
  - No. 
  You did right. 
  But it didn't take. 
  He's back. 
  In the present, not the past. 
  But I'm gonna fix it. 
  Did, uh Did you hang the picture in the dining room? 
  That's where it belongs, isn't it? 
  I found it in the shed. 
  Remember this? 
  Blue moon Who bought it? 
  I was there for You don't know? 
  I want to know if you know. 
  Someone I really could care for Your husband. 
  They played it at your wedding. 
  Ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ee-ooh-ooh Without a dream of my own Ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh-ee-ooh-ooh Ooh ooh, ooh-ee-ooh-ooh Upstairs. 
  The old safe. 
  What's the combination? 
  Your birthday. 
  You saw me standing alone Without a dream in my heart Oh, I I feel light in the head. 
  Would you make me something to eat? 
  Grandma, what's he doing here? 
  When was the last time I bought you a present? 
  I want you to walk down the hill, take a taxi to the mall in Chester's Mill, and let's make up for lost time. 
  I don't think I should leave you alone with that dude. 
  I'm your grandmother. 
  I don't need a baby-sitter. 
  Go on. 
 
 
 
  Go on. 
  Front door open. 
  Where did the boy go? 
  Oh he must be around here someplace. 
  He went out the front door. 
  You were just talking to him. 
  Was I? 
  Why don't you lie down? 
  If you feel light-headed. 
  Good idea. 
  On the sofa. 
  I think it's best if you stay where I can see you, given your condition. 
  You're gonna make it. 
  Although you should be sick out in the rain with no jacket or shoes on. 
  It's 98. 9. 
  That's a fever, right? 
  Quiz or essay? 
  I've been a teacher long enough to know what playin' hooky looks like. 
  Can you just tell him I need to rest? 
  Your father? 
  He loves you, Henry. 
  He does. 
  It's just he was sick before you came to live with us. 
  He had headaches he'd see things that weren't there. 
  It's called glioma. 
  It's a growth in the brain. 
  But But God saved him. 
  I know it's scary, hearing your father talk about hurting himself, but I'm gonna take him to Boston for another scan, and he's gonna be just No. 
  He won't go. 
  He says that you think he's sick, but he's not. 
  If he was, he could just pray it away. 
  What were you doing outside in the rain with no shoes on? 
  Did your father send you out there? 
  We okay? 
  Fine, just, uh Henry's got a fever. 
  Is that right? 
  Well, you better rest up, then. 
  He was teaching me. 
  Listen just just tell him you hear it. 
  God's voice. 
  Or whatever. 
  Just tell him what he wants to hear. 
  Mrs. 
  Deaver. 
  Sorry for the wait. 
  Cute. 
  But you know, lost pets aren't really my department. 
  Henry loves that dog. 
  She's got no tags. 
  Matthew couldn't stand the jingling. 
  Is that really why you're here? 
  I'm not sure if you want to talk to your sheriff, or your I don't know what I am. 
  My friend. 
  Well you say he's never raised a hand, so there's no legal avenue. 
  That's the badge talking. 
  As a friend I have some other ideas. 
  How would that look? 
  Minister's wife takes up with widowed sheriff. 
  No. 
  Not in this town. 
  f*ck this town. 
  Pardon my language. 
  You go buy yourself a road atlas. 
  Put your finger down wherever you like. 
  Texas. 
  Vancouver. 
  We'll make a fresh start. 
  - Alan, I can't leave. 
  - Matthew? 
  You said yourself - he's not the man you married. 
  - No I can't leave Henry. 
  I don't want you to leave your son. 
  All you need to do is pack a suitcase. 
  Oh. 
  Sorry, I didn't know I was I was just leaving anyway. 
  Thank you, Sheriff. 
  Did I ever tell you about what happened to Puck? 
  Matthew said she must have run off. 
  But I found a box of poison in the trash. 
  I always wondered What did he do? 
  Puck! 
  I used to see the turkey vultures wheeling around the sky out back, over the woods, but I was too chickenshit to go look. 
  The thought of her being picked apart, nobody to bury her Over hard. 
  Isn't that how you like them? 
  - Some people run - Thank you. 
  Some people crawl Some people don't even Move at all Some roads lead forward Some roads lead back Some roads are bathed in light Some wrapped in I found these in the garbage. 
  It's a sedative. 
  Oh, time Where did you go? 
  God helps those who help themselves. 
  Oh, time Where did you go? 
  Some people never get And some never give Some people never die It's better this way. 
  The two of us. 
  When I was younger, every night after dinner I had a ritual. 
  Do you know what it was? 
  You'd take a bath. 
  Now, why in heaven did I ever give that up? 
  I could draw one for you. 
  Would you? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Time, oh, good, good, time Where did you go? 
  One. 
  Twenty-two Forty. 
  Ruth! 
  Where'd you go? 
  Ruth? 
  Ruth, where'd you go?! 
  Where'd you go, Ruth? 
  Love of my own - Love of my own - Ruth? 
  Where'd you go? 
  Ruth! 
  Ruth? 
  Ruth? 
  Ruth? 
  Ruth? 
  Ruth? 
  Where did you go? 
  Are you there? 
  Who are you? 
  I'm smaller than a teacup. 
  You're still young. 
  You'll remarry. 
  It was a lovely wedding. 
  I don't want you to leave your son. 
  All you need to do is pack the suitcase. 
  No. 
  Leave him. 
  Just leave him. 
  Please. 
  Just leave him. 
  Ruth? 
  Alan. 
  Who's in there? 
  Is it me? 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Where in God's name have you been? 
  I woke up and you were gone. 
  He's got a fever, Matthew. 
  You're gonna kill him out there. 
  Let's go to bed, Ruth. 
  This ends right now. 
  Tomorrow morning I'm taking you to see Dr. 
  Vargas. 
  Whatever you thought you heard out there Henry heard it too. 
  Is he sick? 
  He told you what you wanted to hear because I told him to. 
  If I'd known you were gonna drag him out all hours of the night, chasing God knows what! 
  Is that right? 
  Do you know what false witness is? 
  ''Yes'', your mother told you to lie to me, - or ''Yes'' - I heard it. 
  Henry. 
  - Good man. 
  - Henry. 
  - Go to your room. 
  - Tell him the truth. 
  It's not your job to protect me, it's my job to protect you! 
  You'd hear it too if you just knew how to listen. 
  You killed the dog, didn't you? 
  I know you did. 
  I can put up with a lot, but I will not let you hurt Henry. 
  I'm takin' him away. 
  Tonight. 
  My bag is packed. 
  No, you won't. 
  You never do. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  - Who's Dr. 
  Vargas? 
  What? 
  ''We'll go see Dr. 
  Vargas. 
  tomorrow. 
  '' Who's Dr. 
  Vargas? 
  Somebody gave her carnations, do you remember that? 
  Do you remember that? 
  She's what do you call it? 
  Neurologist. 
  Neurologist? 
  Yours, not mine. 
  And you can't leave because, see, 'cause you didn't. 
  And you can't leave because you didn't. 
  You're sick, Matthew. 
  You've lost touch with reality. 
  Says the woman that's arguing with her dead husband. 
  Why don't you just ask me what you really want Why don't you just ask me what you really want to know? 
  Where are the bullets? 
  But I can't help you, because I'm not me, I'm you. 
  And you can't remember. 
  I should have taken the gun and shot you in your sleep. 
  - Why? 
  - To protect our son! 
  It's a little late for that, isn't it? 
  What'd you ever do for Henry? 
  Nothing, because you were too chickenshit. 
  - I packed the bag! 
  - And you unpacked it. 
  Clothes back in the drawers, gun back in the linen closet. 
  What? 
  I packed the bullets. 
  I never unpacked 'em. 
  Oh! 
  Ahh! 
  Do you know what false witness is? 
  He was Paul He was Paul, he wasn't Saul. 
  Because your life belongs to God belongs to God Before you tell me it's irresponsible, the bullets are locked away. 
  He'll never find them. 
  The bullets are locked away But I can't help you because I'm not me it wasn't ringing a beautiful experience hear it too if you just knew how to listen, listen What'd you ever do for Henry? 
  Nothing. 
  'Cause you were too chickenshit! 
  Ruth. 
  Hi. 
  It's me, Alan. 
  I've been back from New Hampshire a few months. 
  Maybe you knew that. 
  Uh so, Del Bonsant called, he said he heard gunshots up on North Prospect. 
  I could be dead in the ground, folks would still ring me when they need a policeman. 
  So I figured that, uh, I'd check and see if you needed one. 
  A cop. 
  Ruth. 
  It's 'cause of you. 
  That's why I came back. 
  I I know it's not fair to put this on you after all these years, and if you want me to, I'll go right now. 
  No. 
  Please. 
  Don't leave. 
  Please don't leave. 
  I'm not goin' anywhere.
