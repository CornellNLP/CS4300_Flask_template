 WOMAN: Gordon teaches history. 
  - MOLLY: Where do you teach?

  Were looking for a change of pace. 
  MOLLY: There is a lot of history in this town not all of it good. 
  - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
  - MARTHA: We knew your father. 
  Youre Henry Deaver, arent you? 
  Whats in the basement? 
  Dont make me call the state police. 
  MATTHEW ON VIDEO: Youre lagging. 
  Lets go. 
  Which way do you think it is, son? 
  WILLIE: Your father called it The Voice of God. 
  WILLIE: Inside this chamber is total silence perhaps the only total silence on Earth. 
  HENRY: Hey! 
  MOLLY: Something terrible is going to happen. 
  ALAN: You havent aged one day, not for 27 years. 
  LACY: The reason, the stain The curse on our town.

  [RUTH GASPING] 
  LACY: I still dont know what you really are. 
  [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] 
  The fundamental problem is that repression has become a dirty word, when it is, in fact, a crucial Darwinian tool. 
  The human mind is expressly designed to forget much of its past suffering, as the body is designed to heal its wounds. 
  Yes, but dont the evolutionary psychologists want to have their heuristic cake and eat it, too? 
  Surely youre not suggesting that we ignore the lessons of history? 
  Huxley and Rogers have empirically demonstrated that fetishizing cultural memories is both dangerous and foolhardy. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Well then perhaps Im a fool - [CHUCKLING] 
  - but a fool with tenure. 
  But you know what I just cant forget? 
  That you f*cked my wife. 
  [ROARING] 
  Wow. 
  Its certainly beautiful country. 
  MOLLY: Theres no Masshole summer tourists in Castle Rock. 
  The average cost of a three-bedroom is 39% lower than the next zip code over, and as soon as Main Street is redeveloped, property values are gonna shoot through the roof! 
  Which, by the way, was just re-shingled last year. 
  Would they consider including the art? 
  - MOVER: Youre good. 
  - WIFE: More.

  Can you believe that? 
  Gordon has always been interested in the macabre. 
  He did his Ph. D. 
  Work on the BTK Killer. 
  Well, uh sociological analysis. 
  Nothing too juicy, I m afraid. 
  We believe this to be the first fully immersive lodging experience of historical integrity for the true crime aficionado. 
  A chance to stay in a house where actual murders have been recreated in exquisite detail. 
  WIFE: And as we acquire more properties around town, we think Castle Rock could be a unique destination. 
  Yup. 
  For young people who, um, will like this.
