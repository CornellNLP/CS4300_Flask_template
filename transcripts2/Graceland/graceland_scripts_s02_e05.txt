 Johnny. 
 Go home Johnny. I'll call you. 
 Friday night, me and the boys are hitting up some clubs. 
 My place, 10:00. 
 Those aren't drug mules. 
 You don't use ass like that to haul the product. 
 Ass like that is the product. 
 I'm starting to think that Jakes was right. 
 s*x trade? 
 If you can give me a team, I can go up to Sylmar. 
 I can kick some doors in. 
 Connect this thing to Solano. 
 We have to save these girls, Mike. 
 We will. Promise. 
 We've got a restraining order, Mr. Jakes. 
 I'm your father! Get off me. 
 Who's that man? 
 Looking for some company? 
 There's gonna be a lot of bus-related questions in this interview. You ready? 
 Bus 118 drops all its passengers off and ends up here. 
 Take all these barrels of waste. 
 Load 'em into the back of that rig.

 Hello. I've heard so much about you. 
 Nice to meet you.

 Can it wait, actually? We have a special guest. 
 Our A.D. Foster is here. 
 Oh, hey. 
 How you doing? 
 It's really nice to meet you. 
 I love your... Pantsuit. 
 I like your boxers. 
 Right. 
 Okay, now that we're all acquainted and we're all best friends, what's going on? 
 I'm here to shut down the buses. 
 You can't do that. 
 We're this close to nailing it all to Carlito, and when we do, his whole operation comes down. 
 And we haven't found the girls yet, and the buses are our only link in. 
 I'm well aware of that. 
 And listen, Johnny's right there. 
 What do you need, a week? 
 Yes, that's what I was trying to tell you earlier is that, um, I might have punched Carlito in the face, no matter the situation, the director is shutting down our phony Caza war by the end of the week. 
 Then the Solanos are gonna know the FBI was playing 'em. 
 Exactly, and I don't know about you, but I'd like to walk away with a couple tons of contraband before they do. 
 The next bus will be your last, so whatever we can do by the end of the week. 
 Yeah, it's been a while since I've been here, so I don't... oh, you smell that?

 Hey, uh, I got to head out. 
 Work. 
 Morning, sunshine. 
 Did you seriously take the 405 on the way over here? 
 Is it gonna be one of those role reversal days where I cheer you up and you play curmudgeon? 
 When do I cheer anyone up? 
 Listen, DJ, we need to know about the next shipment, man. 
 Lawrence has to have something, an unpublished schedule or somebody he talks to about the shipments. 
 I'll get to it as the cover develops, no sooner. 
 The next shipment's gonna be the last, so we need to know how much time we have, and you'd already know all this if you weren't out all night. 
 Get your piss out of my ear. 
 I'd be happy to if I didn't have to keep dragging you into these conversations. 
 I'm glad this bus thing is finally wrapping up.

 Interesting tactic. 
 Jesus. 
 Two days. 
 Yeah. 
 It's not much time. 
 Look, I've been going over our resources, and we need everyone we can get taking down this bus line. 
 We're getting additional support already from LAPD, so I'm going to pull the cover team from the s*x trafficking op to work with us. 
 Jess, you can't do that. 
 We're expecting one of these tinker bells on the next bus. 
 We need that team to follow them. 
 We need the team. The buses are priority.

 Oh.

 Your address was on this lawyer stuff. 
 You're quite the Detective. 
 Guess I got it from you then. 
 You're a cop, right? 
 Immigration and customs enforcement. 
 I'm a fed. You ever heard of the feds? 
 Daniel, listen, I really appreciate you coming to find me. 
 I do. 
 It means a lot, but that piece of paper... that prevents us from being able to see one another, so maybe if you talk to your mom... you're in the lava now. 
 Excuse us for a second, but keep playing. 
 No cheating. I am watching you. 
 What are you doing? 
 What? 
 Do you know what it took for him to get here? 
 That kid probably rode 10 Miles on his little huffy to see you. 
 There's a restraining order. 
 You're not keeping him, but you don't have to take him back right away either. 
 I don't know what the hell I would do with the kid. 
 The park, ice cream, a drive. 
 Just be with him. 
 I'm gonna go, okay? 
 Will you come with us? 
 No. 
 Please. 
 No. 
 He likes you, and you're right. 
 I have no idea what I'm doing. 
 I have to get to work. 
 I don't need this. I'll pay you. 
 This can be your little... John for the day.

 Hey. 
 Hey.

 I just found out we won't have a team for your trafficking arrest. 
 What? 
 This is my only shot. I know. 
 Look, it's just... we're pulling three different agencies in two countries, of this whole thing. 
 Okay, that's what this is about... Jessica. 
 How long have you been screwing her? 
 Paige, she's my boss. 
 No, how long? 
 I don't think you... 
 Am I wrong? 
 No. 
 That's not why she pulled your team. 
 How long? 
 Look, it was a passing office romance, a-a fling between coworkers. 
 You seem to be good at those. 
 You're more than just a passing fling. 
 Get me my team back, Mike. 
 I already tried. 
 Then you need to convince her. 
 What do you mean "convince her"? 
 I mean... 
 You need to do whatever you have to do. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay, okay. 
 I want you to think about what you just said to me. 
 I have. 
 You know how much these girls mean to me. 
 You've done it once. You can do it again. 
 [Cheering and chatter in the background] 
 Listen, Daniel, um, I really didn't mean for things to turn out the way they did with you and your mom. 
 I thought I was doing the right thing by leaving, protecting you from the job, and... 
 That was a mistake. 
 It was probably the biggest mistake... no! I hate bumper cars.

 Did you enjoy hitting me, Johnny? 
 Carlito, man, I... did you like it? 
 Be honest with me. 
 A little, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, people are rarely honest with me. 
 I am. 
 Are you, or are you terrified? 
 There's a difference. 
 I'd be lying to myself if I didn't think you might try to kill me right now, man. 
 My father used to make us kiss his fist every night before bed, the same fist he used to hit us with. 
 When I was a little boy, I stole a box of bullets from his closet one time. 
 Lucia and I ran out into the night, and we made this suicide pact. 
 I had this vision of my father finding our bodies. 
 Lucia couldn't do it, so we walked back, you know, feeling silly, like kids again. 
 It wasn't until later on in life that I realized why she couldn't do it. 
 Why? 
 Lucia could never hurt me. 
 My sister means everything to me, Johnny, but the only reason she's even here right now is because my father doesn't trust me. 
 Nobody trusts me. 
 You see, I'm not pretty on the inside like you, but I deserve some things: Trust, loyalty, a chance to prove myself. 
 I will run this family, Johnny. 
 Do you believe in me? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I b... I believe in you. 
 Of course you do.

 I'm gonna go to sleep now. 
 Good night, Johnny. 
 Well... Look who's still alive. 
 How'd it go? 
 Better than expected. 
 You still under or what? 
 It would appear that Carlito has feelings for Johnny. 
 Feelings, feelings? 
 Feelings, feelings. 
 Man, we don't know that for sure. 
 So you're still under? 
 Maybe we can use this. 
 Do you think you can get Carlito to pick up tomorrow's shipment? 
 He's too smart for that. He never does his own pickups. 
 I know that he's normally too smart, but do you think that he could be... Persuaded? 
 I don't know, man. 
 Leveraging affection to get what you want? 
 Female agents do it all the time. 
 Look, we trade in relationships. 
 This is the business. 
 We have 24 hours to get this done.

 I'll do it. I'll do it. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, we're here. 
 Bye.

 Good.

 Yeah.
