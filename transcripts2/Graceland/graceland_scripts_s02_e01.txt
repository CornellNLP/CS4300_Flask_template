 Previously on Graceland. 
 Hey, why do they call it Graceland? 
 When they seized it from this drug lord, he was apparently some hard-core Elvis fan. 
 The name just kind of stuck. 
 I'm your control officer for your investigation into Paul Briggs. 
 Make him put you on a case. Get in tight with him. 
 Put me on Bello. 
 Hell, no. 
 You tell Bello that you got a guy, a marine. 
 Big fish like Bello lead to bigger fish, like the Caza cartel. 
 Paul Briggs is not a criminal. 
 A couple years back, Caza grabbed him. 
 They tortured him and made him a junkie. 
 Then they just opened the door and let him walk out. 
 Jangles. 
 You're gonna help me get Briggs. 
 No, I'm not. 
 This is Agent Juan Badillo. 
 I am undercover as Jangles. 
 You were looking for me, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Stay back. 
 Guns now? 
 [Gunshot] 
 I've been investigating you for the past three months. 
 The agent that gave me this assignment is missing, and the FBI thinks you're responsible. 
 Jangles burned the house down. Jangles killed Lisa. 
 Briggs would never let that go. 
 He wouldn't leave without... 
 Mike, stop. 
 Don't move. 
 You  federale? 
 Maybe we can work together. 
 Jangles shows up, it's gonna get real bloody real fast. 
 I still don't even really know what the guy looks like. 
 Get off him, Paul. 
 This man is Jangles, I'm telling you! 
 It's just me. You know me. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Whimpering] 
 You're no longer a suspect. 
 Jangles killed Juan Badillo. 
 I found the origin of his infamous keys. 
 They were trophies. 
 This one's to Juan's front door. 
 I got things so wrong. 
 Can you ever forgive me? 
 Now, Juan offered you a ticket to D.C. when all this started. 
 We're gonna honor that. So they're offering you special assistant to the deputy director. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 You want to talk, huh? You want to talk, tough guy? 
 [Laughter] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 Did you find the line? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Did you find the... 
 [rock music] 
 [Boat horn blares] 
 [Chuckles] 
 What's up, Leon? 
 Pauly the scorpion. 
 Welcome to  mi casa de agua. 
 I dig it. 
 [Laughs] 
 What did you bring me? 
 Come check it out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Bing! 
 Whoo! 
 Oh, those are some good-looking snapper. 
 Yeah, dig a little deeper. 
 Oh, those aren't the M.R.U.D.s? 
 Those look Serbian to you? 
 Nah. 
 I got you the m18 claymores, baby. 
 Ohh. 
 Real deal. 
 Same price? 
 'Cause it's you. 
 Pow! 
 Oh, yeah, "'cause it's you." 
 Hey, Chuck, I guess you're not the only one that falls for Briggs' charm. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 [Chuckles] Secret's out, Chuck. 
 Hey, Paige is gonna be pissed you stole her travel mug. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Well, she shouldn't have slept in. 
 You snooze, you lose. 
 [Grunts] 
 Blue cooler? 
 Pssh. 
 Yeah, daddy. 
 Oh, these are beautiful, man. 
 Oh, yeah, you can cut a couple of fillets out of that baby, huh? 
 Oh, yeah. You staying for dinner? 
 He ain't staying for dinner. 
 They're wrapping it up. Look lively, people. 
 We go on my word, okay? Hey, Zelanski. 
 Leon's got a knife. Have your team ready. 
 Knife noted. 
 Yo, hombre, you staying for chow? 
 Oh, you know that guy? 
 Maybe. 
 Come on, Briggs. 
 Really? 
 What the hell you doing, man? 
 Hey, yo, Z. Have your team ready. 
 If he's not out in one, you're going in. 
 Copy that. 
 If you know him, it's worth some serious scratch. 
 Oh, yeah? To who? 
 Caza. 
 Caza? Caza cartel? 
 Yeah, yeah, they got a couple of heavy hitters showing that picture all over town. 
 Huh. I wonder why. 
 I mean, guys like that don't talk much, but I'm guessing... 
 [Groans] Mm, right. 
 So you know him or what? 
 Yeah, I know him. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Raking in a lot of profit for someone so new on the block, Arash. 
 Your bus tours take you right through templar cartel territory. 
 It's very dangerous. 
 Why not just go through Durango? 
 [Laughs] 
 Is this our crime you've come for, Chuck Norris? 
 Bad directions? 
 The crime is smuggling. 
 Okay, stop me when I get it wrong. 
 You guys pick up some fat Americans, then you stop in templar and load up on a little something extra. 
 [Scoffs] 
 He knows. 
 What do you know? 
 Shaban, Shaban, it's okay. 
 Think. If he knew something real, he would not be asking questions. 
 [Shouts in native language] 
 [Speaking native language] 
 [Laughs] Lies. This is a lie, okay? 
 Hey. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 We tried to make the business work... three years barely making a profit. 
 Cigars? 
 This is what you were smuggling? 
 30 cases of  cubanos  a week. 
 We are full of shame. 
 We can roll these brothers all the way to Castro. 
 You'll be sitting in that director's chair in less than a month. 
 [Shouting in native language] 
 Arash, Arash. 
 [Knock at door] 
 At least the list is getting shorter. 
 What's up? 
 The deputy director wants us in his office now. 
 Think he's gonna double our budget? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Funny. That's funny, Cranston. 
 News travels fast of our victory in the west. 
 Et tu,  Jessica? 
 I can't pass up a good cigar. 
 This is some good work, Warren. 
 Can't wait to hear what the deputy director has to say. 
 Next time seize some cognac to go with these. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Right. 
 Morning, everyone. 
 Morning, sir. 
 Both : Morning, sir. 
 Morning. 
 Sit, sit, sit. 
 So your buses were carrying no drugs and no weapons. 
 No, sir. 
 Let's skip the small talk, shall we? 
 I'm shutting down your bus investigation. 
 I want you back on my desk in two days. 
 Sir, if I may, shutting us down now would be a mistake. 
 Based on your success so far? 
 Let him talk. 
 Speak. 
 Passenger buses offer some unique advantages. 
 They have their own border inspection area separate from commercial vehicles, no dogs, and they're not subject to the vacis vehicle x-rays. 
 I already heard all of this on your original proposal. 
 Show him the, uh... the payload. 
 Besides passengers, each bus can carry 6 tons. 
 The U.S. imports 10 tons of raw heroin a year. 
 Two buses in this country could be shooting all the smack it wanted and still have room for coke or meth or handguns or whatever else they wanted to bring across. 
 We're not just talking a few kilos here coming across in a spare tire. 
 We're talking about an entirely new smuggling corridor, as big as Nogales. 
 Give me a break. 
 All this chasing some motor oil. 
 The motor oil was an indicator. 
 Yeah, of our wasted expenditure... 
 Cranston, shut up. 
 The fact is, you're giving me old news. 
 We signed up on this because we liked the theory, but you're bringing me back squat. 
 Sir, if you... 
 Shut down the op. 
 And I want you back on my desk first thing next week. 
 Thank you. Sorry, man. 
 That's okay. 
 I tried. 
 What's that gonna cost me? 
 [Laughing] 
 It's gonna be so good to have you back in the office. 
 Don't say that. 
 Say what? 
 That. 
 What? 
 [Both chuckle] 
 You know, you're the one who got me started on these buses. 
 No. No. 
 Yeah. 
 You shouldn't have gotten a field op in the first place. 
 [Laughs] Oh! 
 No, and the only reason why the deputy let you talk him into it is 'cause you had arrived from Graceland like some kind of a rock star. 
 Mm, a rock star, huh? 
 What do you think got me so hot? 
 You are the executive assistant to the deputy director of the FBI, and if you want his job, then you climb that ladder like everyone else, slow and steady. 
 So no shortcuts, huh? 
 Unless you can pull another huge win like Bello out of thin air. 
 You still gonna want me when I'm just like everybody else? 
 Hey. [Both laugh] 
 I thought we were just having fun. 
 Let's do it. 
 Good to have you back, Mike. [Cell phone vibrating] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Agent Briggs. 
 Mikey-Mike. Miss you, man. 
 How's the world of power and monuments treating you, huh? 
 It's good. How about you? 
 Oh, you know me, man, just thinking about good times. 
 My man. How's the house? 
 Good. Good. Everybody's good. 
 You know, it kind of feels like we're missing a musketeer, though. 
 Listen, thought about taking a vacation? 
 Yeah. 
 [Laughs] 
 You serious? 
 Yeah, listen, Mike, I haven't told anyone else about this, but, um... 
 Caza cartel has a hit out on you. 
 Calling you back. 
 Give me a minute, guys. 
 Can you get the door? 
 [Line trilling] 
 So I lay that down, and you hang up? 
 Why does Caza want me? 
 They don't want you, per se. 
 They want Mike the marine... your cover. 
 They got a couple of their guys offering a finder's fee for your whereabouts. 
 Mm, and I take it they're not looking for an arms dealer. 
 You know, Mike, after the damage you and Bello did to their business, I'd say they're probably looking for your head on a stick. 
 So what's your plan, Stan? 
 We get them on attempted murder, roll them up on their bosses. 
 I mean, trust me. 
 Just come out for a long weekend, three, four days Max. 
 We'll squeeze in some surfing, destroy a billion-dollar cartel, and restore our legend status at the bureau. 
 I mean, who doesn't need a win, huh? 
 Since when are you concerned what the bureau thinks of you? 
 If you recall, I have a lot of repair work to do. 
 [Sighs] Okay. 
 Okay what? 
 Okay, I'm your bait. 
 My man. All right, we'll talk soon. 
 [Electronic music] 
 There will be severe consequences for failure. 
 Everything is riding on your skill and ability to adapt to the situation around... what is... he's cheating. 
 Dude, you didn't even say anything. 
 Johnny, how do you know I'm cheating if you're not cheating? 
 Because I know you. 
 Shut up. Shut up, you two. 
 I was testing you, and you failed. 
 Jakes, stop cheating. 
 Hurry up. Bates... 
 Officiate. 
 Fine, fine, fine, fine. 
 Put it on, man. Same time. 
 Man up, all right? Man up. 
 On my mark... 
 Go! 
 Oh, oh. 
 Go, come on, Johnny! 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Whoo! 
 Aah! 
 Go, come on, Johnny, Johnny! 
 Go, Jakes! [Overlapping shouting] 
 [Laughter] 
 One. 
 One. 
 Two. 
 Two. Five. 
 Hey, you're cheating again. 
 Jakes, stop, stop! 
 I'm not cheating. 
 Three. 
 Start over. 
 Mind your business. 
 Four. Johnny, move, move! 
 Five, six. 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 Five. 
 Five. 
 Six. 
 Eight. 
 Seven. 
 Nine. 
 Seven. 
 Eight. 
 Eight. 
 Nine. 
 There's no guns downstairs. 
 Mike. 
 Yo, Mikey! Dead man walking. 
 That's not funny, Johnny. 
 It's a little funny. 
 So you guys heard about the hit, huh? 
 Hey, baby. 
 Hey. 
 What's up, brother? 
 How you doing, man? Good. You? 
 Good, good. 
 Hey, stranger. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 [Mouthing words] 
 And we have a winner! 
 No. 
 No. Veto that. 
 Whoo! 
 Absolutely not. 
 No. He's cheating again. 
 You choose to greet Levi, I choose to be a champion. 
 Another poor life choice, John boy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Welcome home, son! 
 Jesus. 
 [Laughter] Hey! 
 What the hell happened to you, man? 
 What, a man can't be happy? 
 He's been like this for a couple months. 
 It's weird, right? Welcome home. 
 Mike, I'm Zelanski, with the DEA. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 No, call him "bates," man. 
 Hey, don't... don't call me "bates." 
 He took your room. 
 Why "bates"? 
 'Cause he mastur-bates. 
 Yo, we caught him jerking it during surveillance. 
 Once. 
 I was alone in the car for, like, 12 hours. 
 [Laughs] 
 And now you're in my room. 
 Yeah. [Laughter] 
 I didn't know you were crashing here, man. 
 I'm cool with the couch. 
 It's fine. 
 I got good memories on the couch. 
 Beer? 
 Op tomorrow. 
 Mike, take a beer, dude. 
 You didn't get that stick out your ass in the east? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Lay off, Johnny. 
 Come on. 
 Where's Briggs? 
 He's upstairs. 
 You know Briggs... never any time to party. 
 [Laughing] Yeah, right. 
 You're talking about Paul Briggs, right? 
 It's a new day, son. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right, round two, round two. 
 I feel like winning again. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Not in a partying mood, huh? 
 Ha. Michael. 
 Good to see you, man. Glad you could make it out. 
 I know the house of hoover keeps you busy. 
 It does. 
 How's it feel to be back? 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 I missed it. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Things are different. 
 How so? 
 There was a strict "no guns downstairs" policy when I lived here. 
 Jakes hugged me. 
 Yeah. Yeah, that would be entropy... all things running towards chaos. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is this the stuff for tomorrow? 
 Yeah, you want to run through the paces? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 You? 
 I'm good with the  agua. 
 Where we at? 
 Caza file. 
 Okay. 
 Ooh. Yeah. 
 Never gonna drink again. 
 Who is that? 
 Oh, snap. 
 Mikey! 
 You and Briggs all partied out up there? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, it's good to see you, man. 
 It's good to see you too. 
 [Groans] 
 How you been? 
 [Scoffs] Great. 
 Been working up some cases on my own. 
 That's great, man. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, man, your U.C. with Bello... it really, really inspired me. 
 So you're the case agent? 
 No. 
 No, I always end up getting sidetracked running cover team for somebody else's ops. 
 We all have our own talents, you know. 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles, sniffs] 
 Really. 
 Sorry about the mess, man. 
 I've slept on your empties before. 
 I know. 
 Who gets the pleasure of cleaning this all up? 
 Come on, bro. 
 You of all people should remember the chore wheel. 
 [Laughs] 
 Night, Mikey. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cell phone vibrating] 
 Hey, you. 
 Hey, Mike. Do you have a death wish? 
 No, I do not have a death wish. 
 Why didn't you tell me that you were going to Graceland? 
 Oh, so now we're telling each other everything? 
 'Cause last night we were just having fun, Jess. 
 [Sighs] What are you doing there, Mike? 
 What did Briggs promise you? 
 He promised me some surfing before we take down a billion-dollar cartel. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Groans] 
 Hey. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Groans] 
 [Distorted voices] 
 Paul... 
 You were having the nightmare. 
 I woke you up? 
 It's almost time. 
 You want to tell me what's churning around in that head of yours? 
 I never remember my dreams, baby. 
 That's a good thing. 
 Didn't seem like you were in a happy place. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Maybe we should sleep separate. 
 I didn't say we should sleep apart. 
 I said it didn't seem like you were in a happy place. 
 This is my happy place. 
 Better. 
 
 
 
 [Knock at door] 
 Charlie? 
 Secret's out. 
 What? 
 You weren't in your room. 
 That's because she's in my room. 
 You were the last one to drive the van. 
 Do you need the keys? 
 Yeah, I got to go drop off some barrels. 
 Thanks, babe. 
 Duty calls. 
 Come here. 
 Go. [Both laugh] 
 Get out of here. 
 Fried them just the way you like them. 
 Awesome. 
 Oh, hey, will you actually put it on paper? 
 I got to get going. [Speaking spanish] 
 Coming up. Johnny! 
 What? I'm right here. 
 Where are all the to-go mugs? 
 I don't know. 
 Why do you got to automatically assume it's me? 
 I'm very sensitive about that. 
 You. Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Yep. 
 So if I went up to your room right now, I wouldn't find all of our mugs? 
 Not if I get up there first. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 Eggs, Warren? 
 Please. 
 Hey, yo, why do you think Jakes would get a credit report? 
 None of your goddamn business is why, man. 
 Anything in here of yours I shouldn't be drinking? 
 Is he still doing the whole labeling thing? 
 Not for a while. 
 Hey, why did you stop labeling everything, bro? 
 Maybe I grew up. 
 Or maybe Briggs stopped stealing your sh... 
 Not likely. 
 All gassed up. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 You got it. 
 Hey, Mike. 
 Good luck today. 
 Yeah, Mike, good luck. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 [Sighs] Mikey, don't get shot. 
 Do not get shot, Mike. 
 Please don't get shot. 
 Yo, I'm out too, y'all. 
 I got to go see a guy about a thing. 
 Buying a new car? 
 Nope. 
 What kind you thinking about? 
 I'm not buying a car, Johnny. 
 I'll go with you. I'll test-drive it with you. 
 Leave me alone. See ya. 
 You know, today should go well. 
 We stage at 9:00, meet Leon at 10:00, bad guys go to jail at 11:00. 
 We should be riding the waves by noon. 
 Got to respect that confidence. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah, Leon thinks I'm bringing you for a little meet and greet because you've got a crate of at4 rocket launchers to sell. 
 Damn. I must have some serious contacts. 
 Yeah, well, nothing but the best, Agent Warren, especially when you're making it up as you go along. 
 Now, in reality, Leon needs to visually confirm that you are indeed Mike the marine, okay? 
 Formerly in the employ of our friend Bello. 
 And once he's satisfied that you're you, he'll call in the Caza cavalry. But before they can kill me... 
 We'll arrest them and start flipping them, baby. 
 Surfing by noon. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 That's some professional-grade stuff, Chuck. 
 Thanks, Mikey. 
 Yeah, it better be. 
 She's undercover at a tattoo parlor. 
 Little ink spot in east L.A. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah, where guys come in to get teardrop tattoos. 
 No sh... 
 Yeah, they open up and confess all sorts of crap. 
 They literally have me tattooing their murders on their face. 
 All right, all good. 
 Yeah, a thing of beauty, Chuck. 
 I'll just go check in with Johnny and his team, and we'll be on our merry way. 
 Okay. 
 Cool. 
 Something on your mind? 
 Yeah. How's he doing? 
 Paul? 
 Yeah. 
 He's good, real good. 
 Good. Good. I just... you know, I find myself sometimes thinking about everything that happened... you know, Juan's death. 
 You and I both thought he was Odin. 
 You guys are sleeping together? 
 How do you know those are mine? 
 No civilians upstairs, and I know they're not Paige's. 
 Cast the first stone, lover boy. 
 No, we nev... so you think he's clean? He's in a really good place. 
 He didn't deserve the stuff we put him through. 
 Don't go dredging this stuff up again, Mike. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 I just want to know the truth. 
 You already know. 
 We got Briggs and Warren wired up. 
 As soon as we see these Caza pricks, we move in. 
 The point is to talk to these guys. 
 So if things head south, put them down, but keep them breathing. 
 So any nerves about going undercover again? 
 Nope. More excited than anything. 
 Yeah. 
 You and Charlie, huh? 
 You fishing, Warren? 
 No, sir. 
 Panties on your floor. 
 Oh. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is that smart? 
 I guess we both needed somebody to lean on, you know? 
 [Tires screech] 
 Ha. 
 There he is. 
 Ah, what's up, Leon? 
 Pauly! 
 Is that him? 
 Yeah, man. 
 Easy money, just like I said, bro. 
 Hey, Mike, I want you to meet my, uh, good friend Leon. 
 Nice to meet you, Leon. 
 Likewise, Mike. Likewise. 
 Let's see that merchandise, huh? 
 Is that him? 
 Yeah. 
 You gonna call Caza or what? 
 Huh? Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 [Scoffs] Leon, what... what are you doing, bro? 
 We got a gun. 
 I see it. No shot. No shot. 
 Change of plans, Paul, all right? 
 We're not splitting the money. What did you do? Where's Caza? 
 Hey, I'm making this easy on you, bro. 
 You're making this easy on me by putting a gun in my face? 
 That don't feel easy. I will hurt you, Paul. 
 All right? 
 You'll hurt me? 
 I will hurt you bad. 
 Damn it, Briggs, you're in my line, man. 
 I'm telling you, Leon, you really don't want to do this. 
 Don't you tell me what I want to do, okay? 
 Hey. Hey. Mike, be cool. 
 I've got him. I'm taking the shot. 
 Briggs blocked me intentionally this time. 
 Anyone else got a shot? 
 No shot. 
 What's going on here? 
 Just a little disagreement between friends. 
 I'll shoot you both, I swear to God. 
 I don't care what they say. I will bring them a corpse. 
 You know what? Screw it. 
 Johnny, shoot him in the hand. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Groaning] 
 How did you do that, Paul? 
 Gee, I don't know, Leon. 
 Maybe because I'm a fed. [Groans] 
 You dumbass, you're under arrest. 
 Briggs. 
 Yeah. 
 We still gonna be surfing by noon? 
 Probably not. 
 No, you're doing it wrong. 
 Shut up. 
 Oh, man, you guys are heartless, man... 
 Heartless. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Leon, you just tried to cut me out of this deal. 
 And you were about to hand me over to some assassins. 
 Hey, how was I supposed to know they were assassins, huh? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How do we reach them? 
 Number's under... 
 [Clears throat] "Killboys." 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yes, it is. 
 [Cell phone beeps, line trilling] 
 Yo, what's taking so long? 
 Got a little change in plans. 
 Your boy Leon here just tried to cut me out, so now you're dealing with me. Who are you? 
 Who am I? I'm the guy who has the guy. 
 You want your marine, come to me. 
 Nah. Keep this phone. 
 We'll tell you when and where. 
 [Line clicks, dial tone] 
 [Sighs] 
 What was that? 
 Thanks a lot, Leon. 
 I'm calling it off. Guys, nothing's changed. 
 We still grab them, and we roll them up. 
 If we don't control the time or place of the meet, I can't guarantee your safety, Mike. 
 My safety? 
 Yeah. 
 Since when are you concerned about my safety? 
 Used to be you'd march me to the gates of hell if it meant a shot at the Caza cartel. 
 Look, let it go, man. 
 If Briggs says the mission is over, it's over... come on. 
 You need to start thinking for yourself, John. 
 I'm... I'm sorry, what'd you say to me? 
 Wow. You're really on one today, aren't you, Warren? 
 What happened to you guys? 
 The Briggs that I knew... he could see things from 3,000 feet. 
 Now it's like... it's like you guys are a bunch of beach burnouts playing cops and robbers. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Burnouts? Okay. 
 Can we get to work? 
 Or should we go spin around the shotgun? 
 That looked fun. 
 Can I hit him? 
 No, Johnny, you can't. 
 I'm calling the operation, Mike. 
 It's off. 
 I'm sorry you wasted a first-class ticket out here. 
 Hope you didn't wrinkle your suit. 
 You know we were doing fine without you, right, bro? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 So D.C. kind of turned you into an asshole, huh? 
 Now I'm an asshole. 
 Mm, just like we're burnouts. 
 I didn't mean you. 
 Johnny wasn't the only one spinning around the shotgun, Mike. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Look, when I got to D.C., I was... [Sighs] 
 I mean, I was a rock star. 
 I was a real undercover agent, you know? 
 Everyone was excited, and... 
 They were so excited, they stuck me behind a desk. 
 Isn't that what you wanted? 
 Maybe. 
 But after you do what we do... 
 Nothing else feels like real life. 
 I know. 
 I had this theory, right? 
 This bus theory. 
 And I basically made them... forced them to let me pursue it. 
 And I just burned right through all the clout that I had going in. 
 Ah, so you're back here to try to make yourself a rock star again. 
 [Laughs] 
 This world has enough dead rock stars, Mike. 
 Briggs is just trying to make sure you're not one of them. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] Hey, darling. 
 It's late. 
 Needed a walk is all. 
 Another long walk, huh? 
 Like you've never needed to clear your head. 
 [Inhales] 
 You said you were quitting. I know what I said. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Can we talk? 
 What's up? 
 I have a D.C. section chief that's given me control over this Caza op. 
 Doing it with or without you. 
 Look at you. 
 Pulling rank, huh? 
 Nice. Guess that's that. 
 I'd prefer if it was with you. 
 Yes, sir, Agent Warren. 
 Your preference will certainly be taken into consideration. 
 Just got a call from Caza. 
 What'd they say? 
 They gave us a place and time. 
 You're in? 
 Yeah... 
 Against my better judgment. 
 [Horn honks] [Sirens wailing] 
 It's a little on the small side, but I think I could make it work. 
 It's just the two of you? 
 Yeah, me and my son. 
 All right, so we got transponders on both your phones, so we can track you in case anything goes wrong. 
 Nothing's gonna go wrong, is it, Johnny? 
 I don't know, you know, us liquored-up burnouts can't do nothing right. [Chuckles] 
 I didn't call you guys drunks. 
 Dick, bro. 
 I don't want to be a part of this, Paul. 
 Yeah? Well, maybe you should stop breaking the law, then, Leon. 
 You wouldn't have this little problem. 
 Have a seat. 
 Ow. 
 Now, you're the only one who's seen our Caza boys, so don't be shy. 
 See, got a nice little screen here and everything for you. 
 [Dogs barking] 
 [Sighs] 
 These guys are late. 
 I expect a certain level of professionalism in my professional assassins. 
 Mmhmm. 
 This is sloppy. I don't like it. 
 [Dogs barking frantically] 
 What's going on with those dogs? 
 I think we've been stood up, guys. 
 Hey, what's all that barking anyway? 
 [Dogs barking, whimpering] 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 I think we got a dogfight going on in there. 
 Anybody got a visual on that noise? 
 Hey, are they with you guys? 
 That's not us. 
 [Tires screech] 
 You two stay there. 
 What's going on, officers? 
 Are these guys serious? 
 Hey. 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 LAPD! Everybody freeze! 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 You, you. 
 Who's responsible? 
 You, you. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Up against the wall. 
 Let me see your hands. 
 Let's go, let's go. Let's go, move, move. 
 [Dog barks] 
 Hey, Briggs and Warren moved out of camera range. 
 Z. 
 Mmhmm. 
 Get your cover team close, but hold, okay? 
 Yeah, copy. Rolling. Let's go. 
 There, there, that's them. 
 Hey, belay my last. 
 Targets arrived. 
 Let's get in and take them down. 
 Where the hell did they go? 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 This ain't a coincidence. I'm calling it. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Mike. 
 Michael! 
 Where's Warren? Warren's in motion. 
 He's on the move. 
 They got him. 
 [Engine revving] 
 Right there, right there. 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go. 
 West on Anaheim. No, east. 
 Damn it, Z. 
 Give me that thing, man. Left, Johnny, here. 
 How the hell did they get that far ahead of us? 
 'Cause it took your lazy ass three minutes to get the car. 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 Let's go, white boy. 
 Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it easy. 
 No. No! 
 They stopped. 
 Where? Where, where? 
 East on Florence. 
 Go. Stash house central, bro. 
 Any belong to Caza? 
 It's the right neighborhood. 
 We got LAPD backup? Yeah, tact is on it. 
 Callate. - Phone, watch, shirt, pants. 
 Let's go.  Andale! 
 Leave your phone. 
 Today, I said. All right. 
 There. 
 Where's there, Briggs? 
 End of the block on the right, Johnny. 
 Pick it up. Pick it up. 
 Andale. Andale! 
 All right. 
 Get him in there. 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Sighs] We lost him. 
 Hey Briggs, we got fresh tracks. They switched cars on us. 
 There's a traffic cam at that stoplight if we know what we're looking for. 
 Hey, man, you see a car here a couple minutes ago? 
 Depends. 
 Johnny, give me 20 bucks. 
 I don't... I don't got 20. 
 Johnny, give me 20 bucks. 
 Damn it. You gonna pay me back? 
 Maybe. 
 Look, brother, I'm looking for a friend of mine, okay? 
 He was just here a couple of minutes ago. 
 Yeah, I saw a car. 
 It was red. 
 Anything else? 
 It was old. 
 All right, we need an all-points on something red and old. 
 Can't be more than five minutes ahead of us. 
 All right, we need the traffic cam from Cherry and Florence. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 [Groaning] 
 So you want to talk, huh? 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 You want to talk, tough guy? 
 [Laughter] 
 Did you find the line? 
 La linea, cabron. 
 Guero. 
 The line. Habla. - [Gasps, coughing] Linea,  huh? The line. [Laughs] What... damn it. What do you want, man? I don't know what you're talking about. [Both speaking spanish] Now tell me! Did you find the line? La linea, gringo. [Choking] [Distorted voice] Tell me. The line. Did you find the line? [Gasping] [Laughter] You like it? You like, gringo? You're a tough guy, huh? You think you're tough, huh? No. [Mockingly gasping] [Speaking spanish] The line. What line, man? Damn it. Huh? What? [Speaking spanish] The line. The bus line. [Speaking spanish] The bus line. Buses. [Speaking spanish] [Whispering indistinctly] What did you say, hmm? What did you say? [Grunts] [Both yelling] [Speaking spanish] La linea, gringo. Don't lie, gringo! Don't lie, gringo! Linea, guero. Don't lie! Don't lie, gringo. Don't lie. La linea, gringo. [Speaking spanish] [Gunshots] [Gasps] Mike. You all right, buddy? [Coughs] Breathe. You're all right. What did they do to you, man? It felt like torture. Hmm, looks like Caza's got a new interrogation method. Cheaper than waterboarding, without all the mess. I appreciate the help. What are you talking about, dog? You had them right where you wanted them. [Both chuckle] Thanks for leaving me the scraps. Sure. [Both chuckle] You can't go in there. Out of the way. We're family. Mike, are you okay? I'm so sorry I wasn't here. You okay? Chuck, let him breathe. I'm okay. Yeah? Yeah. Bet that desk job doesn't look so bad now, huh? Oh, yeah, you know, pushing papers, answering calls. Glad you're okay... Rock star. Hey, Mike, looks like you got hit by a couple of newbies. What do you mean? This ink is still fresh, and the skin is red and puffy. These are some raw recruits. That's quite the initiation. You thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah, if you're gonna torture and kill a guy, you don't send a freshman. No, you send the best you got. The plastic bags are new. Mm, yeah, haven't seen that in Caza's book of tricks. This wasn't Caza. Hey. Don't hey me. I have to find out you're still alive by reading an op report? This is the first chance I've had to call. Are you alone right now? What's going on, Mike? So the guys who grabbed me... Don't worry. We've already mobilized a small army to hit the Caza cartel. Good, that's good, but wasn't them. It wasn't who? It wasn't Caza. What are you talking about? Jess, I was right about the buses. [Sighs] God damn it, Mike. Listen, okay? They just kept asking me, "what line? Do you know the line?" Did they say "bus line"? They said "bus line." Look, I don't know everything yet, but that's why I need a team. You're asking me to take a run at Caza, who may or may not be involved, and then assign you a team, so you can knock over buses again. It's worth it, Jess. This is the big one. Please. [Sighs] This is gonna be a tough sell to the director. I know. I just need some time and an operating budget. And a team. And a team. Hey, p-funk, where's Charlie? Downstairs. Chuck! What's going on? What's with the yelling? Everybody, Mike here has got an announcement. Gonna call Johnny a burnout again? I shouldn't have said that. Thank you. Listen, the guys who, uh... You know, did what they did to me, were pretending to be Caza. So now the question is, who were they? Who are they working for? For the last few months, I've been investigating a theory that I think holds the answer... buses... Smuggling contraband in passenger buses. And the FBI has given me a team to prove it. Great. Congrats to you, bro. I'm sorry I almost hit you. [Laughs] Volleyball, anybody? Yeah, let's do it. Guys, guys. I'm not done yet. You guys are my team. [Sighs] Anyway, I'll be moving back in. The deputy director will be in contact with your supervisors to work out the details, but for the next eight weeks, you guys will be working for me.
