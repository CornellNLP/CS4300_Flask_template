 Previously on Graceland... 
 You're Lina's sister. 
 Lina sends letter that she runs. 
 Scottsdale. 
 You said you had a guy who could help me pull this bank job. 
 Nope. 
 Billy. 
 I said I had a genius. 
 Hi, Amber. This is Charlie. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Groans] 
 Amber did it herself. 
 I mean, I know this broad was tough, but to pull a slug out of your own back? 
 She wants to meet up, make amends. 
 Can you get me a support team? - Yeah, I'll call it in. 
 Don't do this! Amber! 
 Me and the gang, we're gonna take a little road trip tomorrow. 
 I was hoping you'd come along. 
 I thought your contract with Carlos Solano expired? 
 I imagine he wants to make a new one. 
 A U.S. attorney is not going to bring me up on charges once we arrest Detective Markham. 
 And every second that little prick's not in cuffs, your stock is going down. 
 [Sniffs] Right now, I think I smell scared. 
 What are you doing? 
 Marking bills. 
 Yep, take the money to Solano, Solano pays the GTF, and Mike busts in with the wad of little purple dots. 
 So we just take our cut from here? 
 No, from there. 
 I always have some cash on hand to serve as payment. 
 I'll have somebody come and collect it. 
 Yeah, we'll unload the bins. 
 Dude, get those marked bills into Sid's briefcase. 
 I see he has a stranger handle his money now. 
 When do we leave? 
 Tomorrow morning. 
 I have something to help us. 
 You're already stealing his daughter. 
 Why not steal his money too? 
 What did you do? 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... 
 Nobody saw me, Johnny. I promise. 
 Please tell me there was another briefcase, okay? 
 Just tell me there was another one. 
 I don't know. This money's for us. 
 We can get away from everyone. 
 What are you doing? 
 sh1t! 
 sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t. 
 sh1t! sh1t! 
 Okay, look... Sid's gonna get there, there's gonna be no briefcase. 
 Sid? Oh, no. 
 What are you? 
 What does that mean? 
 It means what are you, Johnny? 
 Policia federal? 
 Hmm, FPM? 
 FBI. 
 I couldn't tell you until after the arrests. 
 You are a liar. A piece of sh1t. 
 I'm not a liar... 
 Don't touch me! 
 Who are you arresting? 
 Carlito or my father? 
 Both. 
 Look, you said so yourself. You don't want them. 
 I don't want them in prison. 
 This isn't the way. 
 This is the only way. 
 You can't have both! 
 What do you think? 
 We're gonna move to New Zealand? 
 Look up at the Southern cross? 
 Come on! 
 If we're lucky, we live out our whole lives hiding and scared. 
 If we're unlucky, you know who we're dealing with. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Now I take that back before someone notices it's gone. 
 Look, if the bureau thinks you're involved, I can't protect you, okay? 
 Just stay here, keep the blinds closed. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No, you're not! 
 This ain't a game! 
 You can't walk into that house with a briefcase full of money. 
 I can.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Bro, you been in L.A., what? 
 About a month or so now, yeah? 
 Yeah, yeah, about that. 
 And where you end up hanging your hat? 
 I got myself a little bungalow over in Playa Del Rey. 
 Ah, Playa Del Rey, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 You like that? 
 Other than the fact that I know a little too much about my neighbor's s*x life, it's cool. 
 All right. You by the water? 
 Uh, no, actually over closer to Loyola Marymount. 
 sh1t, man. I had to park my ass underneath a Christian college, I'd be out at Pepperdine. 
 Right. 
 It's the Malibu kitties. 
 They love to put out. 
 God, you got zero class. You know that, Archie? 
 Yeah, well, Martinez, ladies in the 'bu don't seem to mind. 
 Well, you know I'm municipal police, so Malibu's really not in the budget. 
 It will be. 
 Are you feeling all right about all this, Paul? 
 I wouldn't be here if I didn't think it's where I belong, Sid. 
 That's a very diplomatic answer. 
 You're a man who chooses his words with exactitude. 
 You just talk out of your ass. - "Exactitudely." 
 How about you, Sid? 
 Feeling good about this? 
 Never felt this good about anything in my life. 
 Look at that, 15 Miles to Mexico. 
 Getting close now. Getting close. 
 Sir, I got a positive I.D. 
 Okay, GTF will be to Solano's within the hour. 
 So unless Sid's keen on sleeping over, we'll have him in custody by end of day. 
 All right, good. 
 I'm gonna give you some leave tomorrow. 
 A few weeks. 
 Respectfully, sir, can we wait and see how this plays out? 
 Respectfully, Warren, I'm not asking. 
 You started a fistfight in Federal Plaza. 
 When you called the U.S. attorney, what exactly did they say? 
 That this case has been a sh1t show from day one and they intend to indict someone. 
 You or Sid, doesn't matter. 
 Who's this, Amber? 
 It's not important right now, Charlie. 
 Sit up here, okay? 
 Hop up. 
 Come on, love, hop up. 
 Get off me. 
 So... 
 You're a lady copper then, is that right? 
 Jesus Christ, is that what this is? 
 No, I'm not a cop. 
 How'd you get out of that vault, eh? 
 Dale had the security code. 
 This is [...] Ridiculous. 
 You know I'm not a cop! 
 I don't know what this has been... you and me... but I know it's something. 
 We can all taste piss when it's sprayed in our face, can't we? Who the hell are you, man? 
 He's just somebody I work with. 
 Money cleaner, huh? 
 Normally, with whom Amber does her job is none of my business. 
 You're tracking her down after the fact when she's with me. 
 Oh, yeah, well, did this bitch tell you she ran off with my cut? 
 Sit down. 
 I'll kill you. 
 See, I told you. It's just about the money. 
 No, no, we got a string of conveniences for her and a string of inconveniences for you. 
 So either the fates simply favor Charlie here or something's amiss. 
 Either way, I think we ought to lean in a little harder. 
 Don't you? Amber. 
 That's your jam, man. I'm taking a walk. 
 Amber, please. 
 It's not personal, Charlie! 
 I'm pregnant! 
 I'm pregnant. 
 The way I see it, that's an advantage. Jesus Christ, man. 
 She's got something to lose. 
 Amber. 
 Not in the stomach.

 Hello?

 Jakes. 
 Paige, don't do that. 
 I need to show you something. 
 Can it wait? I just got... 
 No. 
 [Music continues] 
 Home. 
 Okay, so the letter on the left, this is the one that Lina gave me the day that we met. 
 At Calcoast looking for tinker bells, yeah. 
 You never mailed it? 
 Things didn't exactly go as planned. 
 Now, the one on the right, this one arrived from the Ukraine a week ago. 
 Check out the handwriting. 
 Well, stroke and pressure look good. 
 Signature's within the bounds of deviation. 
 They seem identical. 
 Yup. 
 This was sent a week ago? - Mm-hmm. 
 Lina's alive. 
 No. 
 Lina's not alive? 
 The second one, she didn't write. 
 Look at the way that it's folded. 
 The handwriting is on the outside. 
 So what? 
 Most people when they fold letters, they do it with the writing on the inside. Yeah. 
 That's how Lina originally did it, but I refolded this. 
 Okay, so he replicated her handwriting, but when it came to the folding, he didn't copy Lina. 
 He copied me. He? 
 Are we on this Mike thing again? 
 Paige, it takes a hell of a lot of skill to copy handwriting like this. 
 Yeah, it takes skill, but mainly it takes time and it takes patience. 
 And Mike had weeks after Lina died to copy this letter. 
 Postmark's Scottsdale, Arizona. 
 Okay, listen. I don't have all the answers, but I know that he did this. 
 To send a letter like this halfway across the world, not knowing if it's even gonna make it back, the level of planning... 
 It's almost sociopathic. 
 No, it is sociopathic. 
 You ever think maybe he's not the crazy one? 
 Dale, you owe me. 
 If I run this through prints, we could get a hit on Mike, and I am betting you that he is watching my reports like a hawk. 
 You want me to run it through I.C.E.? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll go put my shoes back on. 
 Sure about this? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, look. I want you to take this. 
 If anything goes wrong, you... if anything goes wrong, I'm not gonna shoot my father, Johnny. 
 Just hurry back. 
 I will. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Hey, uh, your dad, he wanted to run some ideas by me about the next drop. 
 Uhhuh. 
 I was just inside. I didn't see you. 
 It's crazy. 
 I need a favor, Johnny. 
 What's up? 
 My father has a certain dealing at the house today, and he has... Told me that I'm not welcome. 
 Hmm. I'm sorry to hear that, man. 
 I need a ride to town. 
 Yeah, man, I got a lot of sh1t. on my plate right now, so... 
 Of course. 
 Maybe my sister can help. 
 Hey, oh. 
 Come on, man. 
 You want a ride, I got you. 
 Why, thank you, Johnny. 
 What do we got? 
 This letter paints you as a real hero, you know that? Dale- no, I'm serious, Paige. 
 When they say "above and beyond" this is what they're talking about... the sh1t you did to protect those girls. 
 I'm already hearing talks about a possible commendation. 
 I don't need a goddamn commendation, Dale. 
 I want to know about the prints. 
 We got a partial on the stamp. 
 Mike? 
 No, we matched the prints taken from Lina's bed at the compound. 
 No. 
 We also matched a print taken from the pink backpack, the first one. 
 Dead girls don't leave fingerprints. 
 Mike had access to the body, so he could've... 
 Paige, I got a letter verifiably handled by your girl sent from out of state that her own sister swore she wrote. 
 No. People believe what they want to believe. 
 Yeah, no sh1t. 
 Don't you see? 
 This is what he wants. 
 You know, there's a version of this where you're happy. 
 Because it means somewhere in Scottsdale, Arizona your girl's alive. 
 [Spanish radio announcer] 
 [Spanish guitar plays] 
 [Man sings in Spanish] Perfect. 
 Do you like [Speaking Spanish], Johnny? 
 Nah, no, I don't, man. 
 No? 
 Reminds me of all my aunts and uncles who just refused to assimilate. 
 It's funny you see cultural pride as a personal affront. 
 Why cross the river if you don't want to be American? 
 Makes sense really. I guess, you know, you see the world through the chameleon's eyes, always looking for an opportunity to change your color, huh? 
 Hmph. 
 That's why you chose your job. 
 What, smuggler? 
 No, no, of course I mean your real job. 
 [Volume rises] 
 What job is that? 
 The one you do for the United States government. 
 Ah, ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Let me see your hands, Johnny. 
 Let me see them, now. 
 Slow. 
 Put 'em on the wheel. [Johnny breathing hard] 
 [Whispers] There you go. 
 How long have you known? 
 Only since last night. 
 When your little friend swapped the money in the briefcase. 
 If you're gonna do it, do it. 
 Okay. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 It's time. 
 Charlie. 
 Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. 
 More of a man's name, innit? 
 Charlie? 
 Yeah. Maybe that's why you're so sweet on me. 
 You're having a laugh, aren't you? 
 Please. Please... 
 Are... You... Police? 
 No, I told you no. 
 You told me no. 
 You told me, you told me. 
 No! 
 Please. 
 [Whack] You're talking rubbish! 
 Enough! 
 That's enough for now. 
 It's not enough till she talks. 
 I'm telling you that's enough. 
 Fine. 
 I've got to take a piss anyway. 
 You can keep her company. 
 Why are you doing this to me? 
 I didn't do anything to you. 
 You didn't do anything? 
 Your boyfriend shot me. 
 That's not me. 
 This whole thing... 
 All this, Charlie? This isn't my gig. 
 He's gonna work you over until you talk, okay? 
 So just talk. 
 There's nothing to say. 
 Amber, he's gonna kill me. 
 It's not up to me, Charlie. 
 Let me go. 
 I can't. 
 I'm not a cop! 
 [Phones ringing] 
 Clark. 
 What? 
 Oh, God damn it. 
 Has this gone national yet? [Cell phone ringing] 
 No, no, no, don't do anything yet. 
 [Cell phone vibrating] 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Agent DeMarco never arrived at Saturn and Marconi. 
 She didn't show up at all or... 
 Neither did the target. 
 Okay, okay, let me, um... 
 Put an APB out on her car. I'll make some calls. 
 All right, guys, you know the drill. 
 We got two hours for a four-hour move. 
 Pack it up. Pack it up quick. 
 Sir, I can handle this from here. 
 This doesn't affect our operation. 
 This isn't a point of debate, Warren, this is protocol. 
 Until this is cleared over, we've got to be within 60 miles of the field office. 
 You know this. 
 Field office? 
 What was your call about? 
 They found a parcel at HQ addressed to me. 
 Dogs think it might be explosive. 
 What? Look, we can't pull out now. 
 Briggs is still in Tecate. 
 No, his cover's solid, right? 
 We can arrest Sid tomorrow. 
 Let's move it! 
 No radios, no recording devices, etcetera. 
 Those are the house rules. So when we park, gear down. 
 You know that leaves us naked, right, Sid? 
 Better naked than bleeding, huh? 
 [Phone vibrating] 
 All right, arch, you know the deal. 
 Let's take everybody in. Yep. 
 Hey, uh, Sid, can I make a quick call? 
 Brother, we're not heading into a dinner party here. 
 It's about my kid. Please. 
 All right, make it quick. 
 Thanks man, two seconds. 
 Hey, believe it or not, this isn't a good time. 
 You have no idea. 
 Evidently there's a bomb scare in Los Angeles. 
 Bomb scare? 
 Yeah, they're pulling everybody back. 
 They found a package with Clark's name on it. 
 You are telling me there's no arresting unit stateside? 
 No, no, I'm staying. 
 Well, if it's all hands on deck... 
 I'm staying. 
 Every time we get this close to Sid, the whole world falls apart. Well, not today. 
 You think this was Sid? 
 There's no doubt in my mind. 
 Hey, Briggs, have you heard from Charlie? 
 Charlie? No, why? 
 Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. 
 You'll take care of what? 
 Hey, you'll take care of what? 
 Okay, look, she went to go meet Amber to bring her in, and the team just said that neither of them showed up. 
 Where the hell is she, Mike? 
 Briggs, you just stay there and stay on task. 
 I will take care of this, okay? 
 I'm coming back. 
 Briggs. 
 I'm coming back. 
 No... yeah, I'm taking the SUV and I'm heading north. 
 No, no. 
 It'll take me about three hours to get up there. 
 No, you are not leaving. 
 You need to stay... [Dial tone] 
 [Tires screeching] 
 sh1t. 
 Hey, are you ready? 
 No, Briggs is abandoning the operation. 
 Abandoning? What the hell does that mean? 
 Means I'm going to Tecate. 
 No, that's not an option. 
 All right, Sid is there collecting his money right now. 
 If no one is there to witness it... I'm going. 
 And I'm telling you no. 
 I can offer you no support and you have zero jurisdiction in Mexico. 
 What the hell do you even plan on doing? 
 Whatever it takes. 
 He's not getting away again. 
 Warren. Warren! 
 Yo, if we're going to be out here all day, can we at least crack a freakin'... 
 Shut up, Johnny. 
 I'm just saying it's hot, man. 
 Hate the freaking desert. 
 Okay, get out. 
 Go. 
 Andale, go. 
 
 
 
 Where is she? 
 [Man speaks Spanish] 
 [Woman whimpers] 
 Lucia, just... hey, hey... 
 [man speaks Spanish] 
 She ain't got nothing to do with this, dude. 
 Leave her out of it. 
 "Please leave her out of this." 
 Or what, Johnny? Huh? 
 If you hurt either one of us, father will have you beaten. 
 Your father... 
 Is dead. Esta muerto. 
 No. 
 Si. You lie. No. He will be soon, which means I am in charge now. Carlito, what do you want? Tell me what you want, and I'll go get for you. You see your lover here? You know he's an FBI agent? He was gonna throw us all in jail. Oh, you did know that. So, you were going to let this man take your father. Yet now you sit here crying for the same man? AI, Lucia, Lucia, Lucia, that father would forsake me for Johnny, that was painful. Predictable, yes, but painful. But you, my sister? Carlos, I'm sorry. You're sorry. Hermana. Okay, you wanted to come over here? Come on. Ven aca. Please. Kiss her. Hmm? This what you wanted? Kiss my sister. Carlos. Ah, ah. No, no, no, no. Like you mean it. If you love her, kiss... Her. [Whispers] I'm so sorry. Ah,Si... There you go. Ah, that's better. I'm sorry. Now you, bite him. Do it. Let me help you. Bite. Mm, yes. Enough, Carlos. No more. Si, hermanita. You're right. That is enough. I understand the FBI runs my planes, but perhaps you can convince them that your operation is ongoing, yes? Maybe. You will... Tell them. Because if my planes stop, Lucia stops. ÿEntiendes? Say it for me. Say it. If your planes stop, Lucia stops. Mm. There you go. That's enough, lover boy. Go. Go on. Lucia will be okay. I will take good care of Lucia. [Distant gunshots, man shouting] [Gunfire continues] [Gunfire, women screaming] [Man shouting in Spanish] [Gunfire continues] Uhh! Man : Who's shooting? Martinez and Hodges are dead. Go! [Gunfire] [Man shouting] One of yours, Carlos. You betray me? [Gunshot] Huh? Uhh! [Gunfire] Ah! [Clattering] Mm! Mm! [Man moaning] I... I must be dreaming. What the hell happened here? It was a bloodbath. He's a maniac. Who? Who the hell did this? Jesus. What do you mean? You did, Mikey. What? [Straining] You did. What? You did. That's my gun. Jesus Christ, you shot yourself with it and you shot your team. No, it was all you... Warren. You did this. The bomb? Yeah, if I sent Clark the package, he would have to leave. I knew you'd stay. Because you're too proud. But for you to actually come out here... What's the matter with you? No. Now that would just be... The nail in the coffin wouldn't it? [Sirens wailing] If it helps, Mikey, you almost had me. Run. Run, Mikey. [Sirens approaching] I got to tell you, Paul, this is about the height of bullshit. After what your girlfriend pulled last time. Where is she? I don't know. Hey! Where's Amber? Come on, I don't know, man. She left me. Billy, I swear to God, man. There's a money launderer, British guy. If she's with him, then... Charlie's in trouble. [Claps] Are you there? Pay attention to me, yeah? If she was gonna talk, she'd have done it by now. No, the thing with messing someone up is sometimes it's yammer, yammer, yammer, sometimes it's mum. All this "she would've talked by now," that's a whatsit... that's a, um, a fantasy. Am, you got to ask the questions. 'Cause I can't understand a single word that's coming out of this dumbass British ape's mouth. [Spits] Why, you stupid... get up. Come here! Damn it, stop! Let's find out if your baby bounces. Don't! [Voice echoes] Let her go. [Gunshots] Bloody hell's that? Someone's here. Go! Check it out! Uhh! [Thud] Charlie? Charlie! You there? Paul! Paul, I'm upstairs! [Grunts] Damn it! [Whack] Charlie? [Crack] Ah! [Woman grunting] Chuck? Charlie? Chuck, baby? Hey. Hi. Hi. You're in Mexico. No, no, not anymore. I'm right here. You're gonna be okay now, right? Yeah. Put your hands around my neck. I can't get this. Stupid how they make these things. Let me do it, babe. Thanks. How are you feeling, my love? Like a million percodans. I should've been there for you, Charlie. You were there for me, baby. [Voice breaks] Too late. Paul, don't cry. You can't cry. [Crying] If you don't listen, you have to go, all right? Okay. That British guy, germaine, whatever his name is... I'm gonna find that dude, and I'm gonna hurt him. I promise you. If you could I believe you would. There's no could about it. I will. I will. Yeah, well... I need to sleep. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. [Murmurs] Here, baby, here. Easy, easy. You rest easy, okay? [Phone vibrating] Hey, Mike. How'd you know it was me? I don't get a lot of calls from burners. Right. Hey, I heard over the radio. How's Charlie? Well, they got her on some heavy meds. Pain'll hit tomorrow, but, uh, she's alive. So is the baby. That's what matters. You know, if you hadn't left Mexico, you'd be dead. Yeah. You know, Sid's telling the bureau you lit them all up down there. This is what he does. He scorches the earth, and then he sets a fall guy. You don't actually think I did this, do you? No, no, I don't. But you got to come back, man. I can't come back. If you run, Mike... if I run? If I run? You ran to catch Jangles and clear your name, and you were... I need your help. I got shot, Briggs. If I go to a hospital, I'm arrested before they discharge me. I need an I.D. Hang tight, Mikey, help is on the way. [Phone beeps] [Speaking Spanish] Listen, is there anybody there who speaks English? English. [Door opens] Adios, gracias. Hey, where the hell you been? The desert. The desert? Johnny, you been gone all goddamn day. We don't hear sh1t from you. Do you have any idea what's going on in this house? I was with Carlito. I couldn't... so you take a piss. You send a text. I'm sick of this irresponsible... put your hands on me again and see what happens. You had one job to do and you couldn't do that, could you? Why'd you have to get caught switching the money? What? The briefcase. Why you got to mess with the briefcase, man? You had one... Johnny, Johnny, slow up. What are we talking about here? Where's Lucia? She's with Carlito, thanks to you. What, you just let him take her? I didn't... yeah. Yeah, she wanted to go. sh1t. Hey... It's okay. Briggs sent me. What are you doing here? Why... Why the hell would he do that? Charlie woke up. He couldn't come but he said you needed I.D. To check into the hospital so... Mike Richards. Thanks. If you want I can drive you. I want you to go. [Thunder rumbles] This world, Mike... It's overflowing with evil men, men that you can't even fathom. These... Vikings and barbarians. It gets to a point where you start seeing them in places they don't exist. Even... even in the faces of good men. I am so sorry that I didn't believe you. I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna rest for a minute. No, Mike... no, it's okay. I just... just a little bit. Until the storm passes and... Then I'll go. Okay. Okay. I sent a team to Arizona to look for Lina. You found her? No, but we think she's in Scottsdale. She sent a letter to her family, so...
