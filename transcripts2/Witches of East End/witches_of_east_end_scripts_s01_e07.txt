 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 I'm Wendy, by the way. 
 Leo. 
 My name's Leo. I got something you're gonna love. 
 Wendy: Wow... 
 Wait. You were just gonna go without saying good-bye? 
 I feel like you're waiting for me. 
 I'm not waiting. 
 (Whispers): I love you, Archibald. 
 I know about you and Archibald. He doesn't care about you. 
 He's using you. 
 Why are you lying like this? 
 Wendy: You may have fooled her, Archibald, but I know exactly what you're up to. 
 Pila metalli! 
 No! 
 I'll kill you as many times as it takes! 
 (Screams) 
 I'm sorry. 
 You killed my father. 
 Shh... 
 (Crying) 
 You and your family mean so much to me. 
 I have big plans for you. 
 ♪ (Liquid dripping) 
 (Quiet sobbing) 
 (Gasping breaths) 
 (Whispers): Oh, my God. Wait. 
 Ingrid... 
 I'm still your aunt. 
 You're still my niece. 
 This isn't who you are. 
 Actually... 
 I think this is exactly who I am. 
 No. 
 Acidum adere! 
 (Yells) 
 Season 1, Episode 7 
 "Unburied" 
 (Train whistle blowing in distance) 
 ♪ 
 Oh, I thought you went home. 
 Like I'd let you finish inventory by yourself. 
 You do not think much of me, do you? 
 I am not gonna answer that. 
 It is hot in here. 
 I know. Roger refuses to fix the furnace. 
 I keep bugging him about it. 
 Want me to bug him? 
 I've been told I am very good at bugging people. 
 I can vouch for that. 
 What are you doing? 
 Sorry. 
 Sometimes I forget. 
 You... forget what? 
 Mm. 
 (Panting): Killian... 
 Freya? Freya? 
 (Panting): What? What? What's going on? 
 Oh, you woke me up. You're flopping around like a fish. 
 Oh. I must have been having a bad dream. 
 Well, you were talking a lot. 
 What was I saying? 
 I don't know, I could barely understand, but... 
 There was definitely some moaning. 
 Actually, it sounded kind of sexy. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I've always done this. 
 When I was a kid, Ingrid used to bang on the wall in the middle of the night and tell me to shut up. 
 (Chuckles): Well, I am... well aware of your sleep talk. 
 Oh, the first time you said you loved me, it was in your sleep. 
 You never told me that. 
 I didn't want to embarrass you. 
 You know I don't get embarrassed about anything. 
 Okay, maybe I was embarrassed. 
 I-I... 'Cause even though I didn't know if it counted, I said it back. 
 It counted. 
 What were you dreaming about? 
 I don't know. I don't remember. 
 Nothing at all? 
 I just don't remember my dreams. 
 Maybe I should listen a little closer next time, see if I can figure it out for myself. 
 (Laughs softy) 
 I gotta get to work. 
 (Sighs) 
 Whoa. What's going on? 
 You know how I have that whole sleep-talking thing? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I woke Dash up last night, and I was in the middle of a dream with Killian. 
 And he heard you say Killian's name? 
 No, thank God, but it's only a matter of time before he does. 
 And the worst part is, I don't even think about Killian when I'm awake, but sleep Freya hasn't gotten the memo. 
 Oh, that is not good. 
 No. 
 The last thing I need is Dash figuring out what happened between me and Killian because I scream it out in my sleep. 
 What happened between you and Killian? 
 Uh... 
 We kissed. 
 What?! 
 You said you had feelings and desires, but when? 
 Um, at my engagement party. 
 Oh, Freya...! 
 I knew it was a mistake the second I did it; I ran out instantly. 
 I can't believe you didn't tell me this. You tell me everything. 
 I didn't want you to judge me. 
 You really think I would judge you? 
 Yeah. 
 Fine. Maybe, once upon a time, but after all that I've been through, I am in no position to judge anyone ever again, especially not you for a momentary slip. I've done worse. 
 And I assume telling Dash the truth is not an option? 
 No way. He can't ever, ever find out. 
 Okay, okay. So, there is an entire section on dream control in this book where you can come up with a spell. 
 And we are just going to need a bunch of hair, Okay. 
 Some ginger and some anise seeds. 
 Killian’s hair? 
 Wendy: Whew! That's taken care of. 
 Hey, Ingrid. 
 Hey. 
 What is wrong with her? 
 I don't know. 
 Did she get rid of the wall? 
 Yes. Your mother and I snuck into the catacombs at Fair Haven and managed to erase all traces of  ramus mortium  early this morning. 
 Dream control? It's a big spell. 
 Everything okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 No, no, it's not. Not really. 
 Okay, tell your aunt Wendy how she can help. 
 Can you read my cards? 
 Tarot is not like Ouija, Freya. You can't just ask it questions. 
 It reveals what it wants to reveal. Besides, I don't like reading for family. 
 Oh, come on, please? We could do it after that library event tomorrow. 
 You are going? 
 (Laughs): Yeah. Of course. 
 Yeah. What? Rich men, free food, open bar... 
 I'll be there early... ish. 
 Ingrid: Tell me something, if I told you there was a darkness inside of me, what would you say? 
 (Laughs): Ingrid, you are the most proper, rule-abiding person I know. 
 I mean, you won't even take a library book home without officially checking it out. 
 That is not true. Okay, fine, it is... 
 But there's a reason they say you can't judge a book by its cover. 
 Wait, are we still talking about actual books? 
 Man: Hi. 
 Hi. Welcome to the East End library. How can I help you? 
 Can you find as many of these books as possible and bring them to my table? 
 Uh, sure. It may take a few minutes. 
 Just make it sooner rather than later. 
 Hey. 
 You can't just treat people like your servants. 
 If you want these books, you can find them yourself. 
 I thought librarians were supposed to be helpful. 
 We are, when people deserve it. 
 Oh. I get it. 
 You get what? 
 You. I'll bet you were a hall monitor, weren't you? 
 And you became a librarian because you just live to shush peop... 
 Shh! 
 Listen, buddy, you don't know anything about me. 
 I know enough. 
 Oh, really? 
 Because you're the kind of guy who thinks yelling in the library makes you a rebel and a rule breaker when it really just makes you a smug, inconsiderate, disrespectful... 
 And we are moving over here. 
 Maybe you're a little darker than I thought. 
 Hey, are you going to this library thing for your mom? 
 Hello to you, too. 
 Of course I'm going; You think I have a choice? 
 What? What are you looking at? 
 Your hair... 
 Do you actually mean for it to look like that when you leave for the day? 
 (Laughs): Excuse me? 
 I'm saying, this whole messy thing, it can't really be a plan, right? 
 Of course I don't have a plan for my hair. 
 I don't even know what that means. 
 Well, I think you could use a haircut, and I'm pretty sure Penelope would appreciate it. 
 Well, I really don't have time. 
 Actually, you do, because luckily, I am very talented at cutting hair. 
 I used to do all my friends' hair in high school. 
 It's one of my many gifts. 
 But I don't want a haircut. 
 I don't care. 
 Let's go. 
 (Sighs): Okay. 
 Not too short, okay? 
 Relax. It's not gonna hurt at all. 
 Hey. Stay still. 
 (Big sigh) 
 Man, it's like a sauna in here. 
 I know. I keep asking Roger to fix the furnace. 
 Want me to bug him for you? I hear I'm very good at bugging people. 
 What did you say? 
 I'm good at bugging people. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. Why? 
 You seem worried about something. 
 Mm-mm. 
 You do that thing with your face when you're worried. 
 I don't do a thing with my face. 
 You're doing it right now. 
 I'm behind you... You can't see my face. 
 But I can sense it. It's one of my gifts... I can read you like a book. 
 I don't think so. 
 Come here. 
 (Knocking) 
 Hi. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Amy. Hi. Let me just help clean up in here. 
 No, no, no, I got it. I'll just see you out there. 
 Delens somnium meum hominis. 
 Oh, I hope this works. 
 Mm. 
 (Door closes) 
 You okay? 
 I bet you must be feeling awfully confused right now. 
 I was in a cult. 
 I was about to marry Archibald Browning. Wendy killed me. 
 And I remember all of this like it was yesterday. 
 Confused doesn't even begin to cover it. 
 What do you mean? 
 I know that Freya and I always die young. 
 Oh, where do you come up with this? 
 Mom, please! 
 I can see all of these pictures, but we are never old, ever. 
 So my theory is, it's because we always die around now. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 I can't believe this. 
 But... 
 But what? 
 This life is completely different. 
 You guys have never lived this long before, and I have kept you safe. 
 That's my job, and you don't need to worry, because your job is to live your life to the fullest... 
 (Owl hooting) 
 (Wind whistling) 
 (recites the spell) 
 (Speaking Latin) 
 Wake up. 
 Mother... 
 I'm not your mother. You knew me as Athena. 
 Welcome back, Ingrid. I missed you. 
 Ingrid is avoiding me, and Freya asked me to read her cards. 
 Ugh! So do it. 
 Well, I can't just read them to her. 
 Don't do it. 
 I don't know anymore, Wendy. 
 What if it reveals she dies young? 
 You don't want her to find out that way, do you? 
 No, but she might figure it out anyhow. 
 Yeah, I guess you're right. 
 With her gift of premonition. 
 Ingrid found out. She's mad. 
 Oh. Is that why she's acting so weird?! 
 Yeah, among other things. 
 She also found out about the time you killed her. 
 (Gasps) What? 
 I gave you that so that you could help water, right? 
 Aspergo. 
 How did she find out? 
 How do you think? She cooked up a spell. 
 Oh, wow. 
 What did you tell her about the whole dying-young thing? 
 I wanted to tell her to stay in her room, shut the blinds, let me keep her safe, but instead I told her that she should seize the moment while she can. 
 When you don't know how much time you have left, you want to make the most of every second, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Am I alive? 
 Penelope: Not quite. 
 There. Now... 
 That should hold, at least for a day or two. 
 Why am I here? 
 Your aunt Wendy stole something from my father Archibald, the man you loved, and the man you died trying to protect. 
 And I need it back. 
 What is it? 
 It's called  serpens clavem . 
 It's a golden snake. 
 The tail looks like a key. 
 I need you to get it back for me. 
 You can do this for me. 
 I want you to get Wendy alone, and convince her to give it back. 
 In return, you can kill your aunt, the one who murdered you all those years ago. 
 Hi, Leo. 
 What are you doing here? How did you even find me? 
 I have my ways. 
 Um, I've been thinking about you lately, a lot, actually. 
 That's funny, seeing as how I never heard from you again after you pretended to be my neighbor, slept with me, and then, stole my prized butterfly. 
 Was that even really your cat? 
 Oh, that little kitty is very much mine. 
 (Scoffs) 
 Listen, I-I... I really did mean to call and apologize. 
 So what did you do with the Himalayan Stamped Crown you took from me? 
 You sell it on eBay? 
 No, I didn't sell it. 
 I really needed it. 
 And-and I can't explain why. 
 All right, look, I appreciate the whole mysterious vibe thing. 
 I'm sure it works on some guys. 
 I just don't have the time to figure you out right now. 
 Okay? I'm busy. 
 Okay, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What you said was right. I did... I did lie to you. 
 I did... use you, and I feel terrible about it. 
 You may not want to figure me out, but I want to figure you out. 
 When we first met, there was this connection. 
 A spark between us. 
 And I want to get to the bottom of it. 
 You do? 
 My sister said something to me today that made a lot of sense. 
 You got to grab life while you can. 
 Who knows how many lives... I mean, years... 
 We all have left? 
 Look, I'm not in the market for someone who plays games. 
 I get it. I get it, I do. 
 Just give me another chance? 
 Let's go to lunch. 
 There will be no games, I swear. 
 I mean, unless you want to play them. 
 Oh. Oh, you're... Mmm... So generous, darling. 
 Oh, thank you so much for coming. Love you. 
 I'll be right back. Oh, hello. 
 Hey. (Laughs) 
 Hey. 
 Ingrid? Here you are. 
 Hey, George. 
 How are you? 
 Good. It was nice of you to come today. 
 Oh, of course. 
 I try to support the library in any way I can. 
 And, uh... Support you, obviously. 
 I appreciate that. 
 Hey, you. 
 Hey. 
 You having a good time? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 This is the most fun I've ever had in a library. 
 Is it? 
 Well, I know a way we can have even more fun. 
 Oh, really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let's go to London. 
 What? Just like that? 
 You're just gonna snap your fingers, and we're gonna go to London? 
 Yup. How about tomorrow? 
 Are you serious? 
 I got invited to speak at a medical conference in England in two days. 
 Look, I know it's last minute but, are you in? 
 Yes, of course I am. 
 You might be on your own for some of it, be... 
 I mean, I assume you just... 
 You know, you don't want to watch me speak about third world vaccinations all day. 
 No offense, I think I can fill my time. 
 I can't believe I'm gonna finally have a stamp on my passport. 
 Let's make it two. Yeah, let's make it two. 
 Let's hop on the Chunnel, we'll tack on a couple of days in Paris. 
 We'll eat croissants, drink wine. 
 It'll be a rehearsal for our honeymoon. 
 You are killing me! Yes! Yes! That sounds incredible. 
 You do you realize we were supposed to be having lunch, like a real first date, right? 
 Leo: I'm just building up an appetite. 
 (Laughs) 
 I think we did that. 
 Where do you want to go? 
 You choose. 
 I'm good with anything. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Where did you get this necklace? 
 Looks antique. It's cool. 
 Oh. I don't know. 
 I've had it for so long, I can't even remember. 
 Oh. 
 Go get dressed so we can go. 
 (Slapping him gently) 
 Okay. 
 Whoops. 
 (Laughs) 
 Anyway, I should probably be getting back. 
 Hey, why don't we go and get a drink some time? 
 That is sweet, but I'm not really in place for that right now. 
 What's the problem? Are you afraid of a little fun? 
 No. This isn't my idea of fun. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Why don't you... Tell me some of your ideas? 
 Okay. This conversation is over. 
 I don't think that it is. 
 
 
 
 Fractura. 
 (Snapping) 
 Aah! 
 You broke my fingers. What...? 
 You should probably move along now. 
 You didn't have to do that. I can take care of myself. 
 Is there something happening between you and Freya? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I don't know, I thought... 
 Just felt like I was interrupting something earlier. 
 A haircut. 
 (Laughs) 
 Look, I know it's none of my business, but, um, I just wondered if you two had maybe ever... 
 No. God, no. Amy... 
 I just want to make sure I'm not getting in the middle of something... 
 Which, apparently, I'm not. I'm gonna go get a drink, okay? 
 Do you want anything? 
 No thanks. I'm good. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Excuse me, we need to talk. 
 Ever since I was a little kid, I know when something bad is gonna happen. I get this feeling in my stomach. 
 And I have the feeling, right now, out of nowhere. 
 You're being paranoid. Nothing bad is going to happen. 
 I am telling you, I can feel it in my bones. 
 I thought you felt it in your stomach? 
 I feel it in both places. 
 Look, if this is about us, um... 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa, there is no us, and there never has been. 
 That's not exactly true. 
 Nothing is happening. 
 Something happened, but it was a long time ago. It was just a kiss. 
 And we both know that it was a huge mistake. 
 And that is why, we are never, ever, going to tell anyone, because it's over. 
 Okay, relax, take a deep breath. 
 It'll all be fine, I promise. 
 (Sighs) 
 Okay. 
 (Knocking) 
 I got it! 
 Ingrid! 
 Aunt Wendy, you have to come with me. 
 (Gasps) Oh, no. I forgot the library event, didn't I? 
 (Gasps) Freya's going to be so pissed. 
 No, no. It's mom... she's hurt. 
 It's an emergency. You have to come with me now. 
 What? Wait, let me just... 
 No! Now! 
 Leo, there's an emergency with my sister! 
 Wendy? 
 What happened? 
 This shape-shifter tried to kill her with some dark magic. 
 How bad is she hurt? 
 Pretty bad. 
 The only way to help her is with the snake key you took from Archibald. 
 Snake key? I never said anything about a snake key. 
 Yes, you did. 
 No. I would remember that. 
 I think mother may have mentioned it. 
 It was gold... 
 Mother? 
 Wait a minute. How did you know I was here? Nobody knows about Leo. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm your niece. 
 The one you threw over a railing and killed. 
 And now you know how it feels. 
 (water dripping slowly) 
 Expergiscendum. 
 (Gasps) 
 (Wendy gasping loudly) 
 You cannot move. 
 (Gasping) 
 The circle will not let you. 
 You always said I was the most powerful one of us all. 
 Are you the shifter? 
 (Laughs) 
 The shifter reanimated me. 
 I'm Ingrid, your niece. The one you killed, remember? 
 What the hell do you want from me? 
 I want the serpens clavem. 
 Look, I don't know what to tell you. 
 It was destroyed hundreds of years ago. 
 Hmm. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Gasps) 
 (Panting) 
 (Whimpering) 
 Ustulo! 
 (Screaming) 
 (Laughs) 
 I've been waiting over 100 years for this revenge. 
 Ustulo rivulus! 
 (Hissing, screaming) 
 (Panting) 
 (Crying) 
 (Screaming) 
 It's you. 
 Mike. It's Mike. 
 Am I allowed to sit on this bench? 
 I completely need to apologize for yelling at you, um, at the library yesterday. 
 Not a problem. I know I can be a little... 
 I wanted to say thank you for helping me with that guy. 
 Just as long as you know, I could've handled that myself. 
 I have no doubt. You seem very capable. 
 But when I saw him follow you down the aisle, I decided to check on you just in case. 
 Thanks. 
 So, you know my name. Do I get to know yours? 
 I'm so sorry. I'm-I'm Ingrid. Ingrid Beauchamp. 
 Oh, that's a really pretty name. 
 Thank you. 
 Nice to meet you, Ingrid Beauchamp. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 I should... Oh. (Laughs) 
 Hi, mom. 
 Yeah. I'll be right there. 
 I have to run, but, um, I'll see you at the library, right? 
 I'm... I'm still allowed? 
 (Laughing): Yes. Anytime you want. 
 All right. 
 ___ 
 Hey, have you seen Dash? He just disappeared from the library. 
 Not lately. He probably got paged to the hospital or something. 
 You know how much he loves saving lives. 
 Yeah, I don't think so. 
 Oh, there you are. What's up, brother? 
 I've been calling you... 
 What? What? 
 Dash, wait! 
 No, not now, Freya. 
 Oh, my... 
 ...God. 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Hey. Can I help you? 
 I'm looking for Wendy. 
 She was at my place earlier, but she left her bag, and said something about her sister being in trouble? 
 I'm sorry. Who are you? 
 Oh... right. I'm Leo. 
 I'm Joanna. I'm Wendy's sister, and, uh, I'm fine. 
 Um, tell... Exactly what happened? 
 Well, I-I was changing clothes, and someone knocked on the door. 
 Wendy went to go answer it, and by the time I came out to see what was going on, she was gone. 
 You haven't seen her, either, have you? You think she's okay? 
 I'm sure it's just some big misunderstanding. 
 Um, I'll let her know you were here. Thanks for telling me. 
 (Quietly): Damn it. 
 (Speaking Latin) 
 Come on, find the light. 
 (Speaking foreign language) 
 Show me the necklace. 
 (Speaking Latin) 
 (Speaking Latin) 
 (Freya sighs, footsteps) 
 Dash, what are you doing? 
 I'm leaving early for London. 
 I think it's better if I go alone. 
 Look, I-I don't know what you think you know about... 
 I heard you, Freya, at the library. 
 Heard everything you said to him. 
 Did you hear me say that it was a huge mistake? 
 That it was in the past, and didn't mean anything? 
 Come on, you weren't... 
 I wasn't what?! 
 Huh? I wasn't supposed to find out? 
 Yeah, I could've guessed that. 
 Wait, Dash, look, I love you. Please, just... This was a big mis... 
 I can't even look at you right now. 
 (Sighs) 
 This will end if you tell me where the snake is. 
 It's gone. 
 (Breath quivering) 
 But if I knew where it was, I wouldn't tell you anyway. 
 You were corrupt then, and you're corrupt now. 
 Fine. 
 Then I guess I get to kill you. 
 (Loud breathing) 
 Go ahead. 
 And then I'll sit here... And wait. 
 And when you come back to life, I'll kill you again, as many times as it takes. 
 Ingrid, wait. We-we... 
 I killed you by mistake. 
 I'm still your aunt. 
 You're still my niece. This isn't who you are. 
 Actually, I think this is exactly who I am. 
 No. 
 Acidum adere! 
 (Screaming) 
 Ingrid? 
 (Sighs heavily) 
 No, mom, please don't. 
 You're not my daughter. 
 Look in my eyes; You know who I am. 
 I'm Ingrid. 
 Okay, we'll talk about this later. 
 Let's get your aunt and get her out of here. 
 (Screams) 
 Reverte! 
 (Sighs) 
 Reverte ad vestrum priorem statum. 
 But you don't kill people. 
 You were already dead. 
 (Gasps) 
 So it wasn't the shifter? 
 No. 
 It was another enemy from a long time ago, I assume, sent by the shifter. 
 Who, what enemy? 
 No one you'd know about. 
 I've healed her burns, so she's going to be okay. 
 (Sighs) 
 All we can do now is wait. 
 Dash is going to London without me, and I don't even know if he still wants to marry me. 
 Sweetie, what happened? 
 He found out. 
 I knew it was gonna happen. 
 I just... ever since I found out what I am, my intuition just keeps getting stronger and stronger, and I, I need to trust myself more. 
 I'm so sorry, Freya. 
 Dash found out about what? 
 About Killian and me. We kissed. 
 At her engagement party. 
 Freya: It was a mistake! 
 The biggest mistake of my entire life. 
 Because I'm a terrible person. 
 You're not a terrible person. 
 (Laughs) People make mistakes. 
 Not like this, mom. 
 Oh, believe me, I've done much, much worse. 
 I think it's good that Dash went away. 
 It'll give him some alone time to remember why he loves you so much. 
 You really think that? 
 Definitely. 
 Why are we watching aunt Wendy sleep? 
 She's not asleep, she's dead. 
 Oh, my God, again? 
 (Chuckling): It's okay. 
 She won't be long now. 
 (All gasp) 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, that never gets any better. 
 Welcome back... it's nice to see you breathing again. 
 Okay, so we're all here. What did I miss? 
 You got killed, um, and, a friend named Leo stopped by, looking for you. 
 Seemed concerned, seemed to like you. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Chuckling): I guess you took my advice, huh? 
 Yeah, a little bit. 
 (Laughs) All right, come on, girls. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's let Wendy get her strength back. 
 Ingrid. 
 Yeah. 
 Can I talk to you for a second? 
 Of course. 
 So we're okay? 
 I mean, we're even now? 
 What do you mean? 
 Oh, your mom didn't tell you? 
 You killed me. Oh, I mean, you know, the you from 1906. 
 What? 
 The shifter reanimated you... the old you... 
 And sent you after me for revenge. 
 Oh, my God, I'm... 
 So, where is old me now? 
 Uh, um, I'm not sure. 
 You have to ask your mom about that, but I'm sure she took care of it. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, it's okay, it wasn't you. 
 Yes, it was me. I mean, whatever she did, I'm capable of. 
 We're the same person. 
 No, honey, it doesn't work like that. 
 Every life is completely different. 
 Except every life ends about now. 
 Not necessarily. 
 If history is any indication. 
 History can change; I've seen it. 
 It just feels like impossible odds. 
 I mean, ever since I discovered what I am... 
 It's been an endless parade of bad news. 
 Hmm. 
 I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. 
 Well, if it makes any difference, I know who you are. 
 You have such a good heart. 
 You're my favorite Ingrid yet. 
 (Laughs) 
 Thank you. 
 I love you, sweetie. 
 I love you, too. 
 (Knocking) 
 Thought you went home. 
 Here to help with inventory. 
 Man, is it hot in here. 
 Roger refuses to fix the furnace. 
 I keep bugging him about it. 
 Want me to bug him? 
 I've been told I'm very good at bugging people. 
 You have to go. 
 What? 
 This is a dream... the last dream I'll have about you. 
 I'm saying good-bye. 
 Wait, no, you can't. 
 Freya, listen to me. 
 None of this is what you think. 
 Bye, Killian. 
 (Gasps) 
 (Sighs) 
 Hey, you're up. 
 Hey. 
 Well, I did something right. 
 The spell I did worked. I think I'm finally done dreaming of Killian. 
 What are you doing? 
 Freya, sit down. 
 I made a rule that I would never deal the deck for you girls. 
 I think it's asking for problems, but I know you're confused and curious, so I did it for you. 
 Well, what does it say? 
 It's complicated. 
 It's more complicated than I realized. 
 Does it say something about my future with Dash? 
 Are we still getting married? 
 I don't know what will happen. 
 There's a shroud around the future because your choice isn't yet made. 
 What? 
 (Chuckles) This is you in the center of everything, surrounded by love and family. 
 This is the problem. 
 What, the trickster and the emperor? 
 They're mirror images, they're often depicted as brothers... One dark, one light. 
 So one is Dash and one is Killian? 
 Mm-hmm, and, according to the cards, they divide your heart. 
 Well, Killian is obviously the dark one, right? 
 The trickster could be either. 
 He could be dark masquerading as light. 
 That's what he does... He confuses you. 
 What does that even mean? 
 According to the cards, you will love them both. 
 You have a choice to make. 
 One man is your soul mate, the other man's your destroyer. 
 Whoever you choose will decide your fate. 
 Oh, finally. 
 What? 
 I've been wanting to talk to you since I came back to life, but I didn't want to say anything in front of the girls. 
 Why? 
 You know what? I could use a drink. 
 So... 
 So, you know, ever since I had the first vision of you being in danger, we've been trying to figure out who the shifter is and what they want, right? 
 You mean aside from destroying us? 
 Well, I still don't know who the shifter is, but I think I know what they want, and it's not good news. 
 So, what is it? 
 Dead Ingrid kept asking for the serpens clavem... 
 The golden snake. 
 Really...? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, why is she asking you? 
 I don't know, she thought I stole it from Archibald, and I kept telling her that it was destroyed, and she didn't believe me. 
 It was destroyed, right? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm just saying, what if you're wrong? 
 What if it's still out there and the shifter gets a hold of it and opens the portal? 
 The key no longer exists. 
 I saw it get destroyed. 
 No one's opening that portal ever again. 
 Okay, but the  ramus mortium ... 
 It was growing in the catacombs near the entrance. 
 I think that's more than a coincidence, right? 
 No one can open that door without the key. 
 The key is gone. 
 Wendy, stop worrying. 
 Well, it's a lot to worry about. 
 (Sighs) 
 What? 
 Your necklace... it's red. 
 This is your last life. 
 I need more power. 
 Yes.
