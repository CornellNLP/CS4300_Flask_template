 Previously on Witches of East End...  
 The king promised me if I helped him, you would be mine. 
 Yeah, that's not gonna happen. 
 You murdered him, and I helped you cover it up. 
 I don't want this thing to end between us but I can't put you in danger. 
 Killian : When I found out she was dead I knew right then, I couldn't live without her. 
 Mathias : The poison will cost you your life. Hello, Joanna. How could you bring this man into our home?! Wendy : He's gonna bring the girls back. Was he covered in tar? No, it's thicker than tar. You just admitted to spying on me? Joanna : We're going to the past. So now we're gonna use the time door? Time door? We have a time door? What's a time door? We need to get something from the past? It-it's something I used to own. Joanna : We got to leave this instant. I'm staying. I almost failed sophomore English because of Edgar Allan Poe,  and now you're telling me I was in love with him? The Anima Aucupe kills What makes you think that's gonna work? 'Cause a long time ago,  I used it to kill you. I'm gonna get the Anima Aucupe so we can return to East End, Mathias : The poison will burn you as if your soul is being incinerated. Salina : There is no antidote, Killian. No turning back. ♪ ♪ Wendy : Hey! Look what I found hidden in the paddock. Liquid courage. Ooh, burns. Whiskey is definitely better in the future. You ever think about... What would've happened if we had never come here? Where? Baltimore? No. If we hadn't left Asgard, and father hadn't cursed us. Only... Every day. We have had fun along the way, haven't we? (Giggles) Only every day. We do know how to make the best of a bad situation. We do. Is it terrible that I want our father dead? No. But if it's peace you think you'll find in revenge... There's no such thing. We'll kill him in order to stop him, but it won't undo what he did to us. It won't take the pain away. You ready? I should get going. You both stay here. Safe and out of sight. Give me an hour, and I'll meet you at the time door as soon as I have the box. Joanna. Salvus erit. Fortunam. Te amo. Freya : Killian! Killian! I... I can't believe it! The spell worked. Wait, what spell? Well, you're dead. And now, so am I. Freya, finally, we can be together. You should have waited for me. And now it's too late. Too late? I'm alive. You should have waited. Wait! Take this. Please. You have to call Ingrid. Freya? Freya?! Freya! (Groans softly) ♪ ♪ (Moans) Frederick : Ingrid. Frederick. Hey. Where are you going? Um, just taking a walk. I need to clear my head. Grandfather told me you're coming back with us... To Asgard. I am. I mean, how could I pass up a chance to see a whole other world? I knew it would all work out in the end. And it will. I can't wait to show you our home. I can't wait, either. (Cell phone rings) Hello? Ingrid. Killian? You're alive. Yes, are you okay? Is Freya alive, too? Yes. Killian, what's wrong? I drank... Something. What did you drink? Poison. So I could be with Freya. Wait, what? What poison? I had a dream where she came to me. She said she was alive. Okay, Killian. It sounds like you had a vision. What else happened? Did she do something? Say something? She gave me... a red flower. W-with long roots. Oh, my God. I'll be right there. (Door opens) (Door closes) Grandfather? Are you all right? No. My soul's connection to this vessel is weakening. And the effort to show you my true self is... Becoming more difficult than I thought. And you? What is wrong? Frederick, tell me. You seem distressed. I think we might have a problem with Ingrid. Oh, what kind of problem? It seems like she might be having doubts about coming back to Asgard. Tell me. She's been spending a lot of time with Bastian. Ah, he's here? His name is Dash now. He doesn't remember his other lives, but it's definitely him. And they're very close. I'm worried he'll try to talk her out of it. Well, then, I'll have to do something about it. I'll have to, uh... I'll have to increase my strength. What do you mean? Not even you will see me as others see me. In...  In perpetuum...  Mutatio! There now. I feel better already. (Horse neighing) Frey. (Moans) Freya, wake up. Wake up. What? What's going on? This is an appointment that I don't want to be late for. How long have I been asleep? A couple hours, maybe. I was having the most awful dream. Killian was dying. And I had to give him lotus root. That's... deeply fascinating, but w-we may have a slight problem. Hmm? Okay, I don't want you to panic or anything, but, um, I might have lost the key. The key? The key. The key?! Yeah, the key. The key to the time door. The key that gets us home. Are you kidding me?! Do I look like I'm kidding?! What are we gonna do? Can we make another one? It's a magic key, Freya. If we don't find it, we're stuck here. (Grunting, bones cracking) Perfect. You're just my size. Killian? It's Ingrid. Open up! Libero sigillum. Libero sigillum. Killian? Oh. Killian? (Groans) Freya... I need to see her. She's not exactly available at the moment. Here. Open up. Oh, what is that? This is lotus root. I think it's what Freya was trying to give you in the dream. It's a folk remedy used to draw out toxic substances from the body. It's a not cure and I'm not great with potions... That's more Freya's specialty... But it might slow down the progress of whatever you took. "Slow down." Not stop. So, I'm still dying? Killian, I'm so sorry. Let's-let's get you up and walking. See? You're strong. Yeah. Look at that. Okay. You got this. (Horse neighs nearby) I can't believe we might be stuck here forever! Well, technically we won't get to forever. Because if we don't find the key, then we're gonna be dead within a few hours. Because we don't belong here! Okay, okay. Okay. Trahat magnes carmine clavem. What was that? I'm focusing in on the key's energy. Come on, carmine clavem. (Wendy claps her hands) I don't think it's here. Wait! Wait! Maybe we don't need a key! I can pick locks. I went through this delinquent phase when I was 15... What don't you understand about the concept of a magic key, Freya? The spell won't work without it! What are we gonna do? Okay. Okay, we're gonna calm down. We're gonna just retrace our steps. Okay, but we have to hurry because we're running out of time! (Horse neighs) (Indistinct chatter) (Gasps) Penny for my wine, ma'am? I'm sorry. I can't. Anything would help. I tell you what... if you go to the cat & shadow, and speak to whoever's behind the bar, tell them Joanna Beauchamp says you can have a glass of whatever you want. God bless you, Mrs. Beauchamp! You know what, Killian, why don't we call Dash? Because I'm sure he would be able to help... No! No, I'm done with him. Why? What happened? There are some things between us that are never gonna be resolved. Okay, Killian. I'm really sorry to do this, but there's something I have to do. I want you to take three drops of this every 15 minutes, and I will be back here as soon as I can. Thank you, Ingrid. Just hold on a little bit longer. We're gonna get through this. I promise. Tommy? (Laughs) It has been a long time. Bastian. "Bastian"? What the hell are you talking about? How did you get in here? Magic. Hey, you know what? I think it's time to leave. Vinculum! (Grunts) You're not Tommy. Alas... Tommy is no more. I'm just wearing his skin. Then who are you? Someone who could kill you without a second thought. You're Ingrid's grandfather. King Nikolaus. Very good. Now... I understand you've been spending a lot of time with my granddaughter. That is going to stop. You see, I have big plans for my family. So you're going to stay out of my way. And you're going to stay away from Ingrid. Go to hell! Bravo! There's the fire! That's what I like! There's a war happening inside you. Isn't there? Darkness versus light. Which one will win? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, you tasted blood! Not just once. And you enjoyed it. That's the Bastian I knew. Capable of betraying a lover. Or destroying a brother. Whatever it took to get what he wants. That's what I admired about you. You were exceptionally loyal. And because of that, you were rewarded many riches and powers beyond your wildest dreams. Remain loyal now, you will be rewarded again. If you're thinking of buying it, it's out of your price range. Have you ever been there? Fair haven? God, no. I never get invited to the good parties. The good orgies either for that matter. "Orgies"? Sure. Orgies and devil worship and God knows what. The guy that built that place was into some very weird sh1t. "Very weird sh1t," huh? Hey. It's me. I think I might really be onto something here. Okay, Dash. I know exactly what we have to do. And I know this is gonna sound crazy, but... Did something happen in here? Your grandfather just paid me a visit. Oh, no. He must know I've been coming here. I don't think so. Of course he knows. sh1t, Dash, this is bad! I don't think that's why he came. He said he knew me. From another life, back in Asgard or something. Really? He's got plans for your family, and he promised to reward me if I didn't get involved. Dash, you know he's lying, right? Look, Ingrid, I'm on your side. All right? That son of a bitch threatened to kill me. So if there's a way to stop him, let's not just stand here talking about it. Let's do it. Okay. There is a way. We need to bring back the journals we burned. What?! You said those spells were so dark, they'd mess with our souls. Well, we need a dark spell to stop a dark warlock. Okay, but these journals look pretty incinerated to me. I mean, what are we gonna do... Glue them back together piece by piece? No,we're gonna use magic. We can reconstitute them. My mother burned our grimoire once. So, I know we can do this. Women : ♪ sowing in the morning ♪ 
♪ sowing seeds ♪ 
♪ of kindness ♪ 
♪ sowing in the noontide ♪ 
♪ and the dewy Eve ♪ 
♪ waiting for the harvest ♪ 
♪ and the time of reaping ♪ 
♪ we shall come rejoicing ♪ 
♪ bringing in the sheaves. ♪ Maybe I dropped the key in the dressing room. Oh, you better have! I can feel myself starting to Unexist by the second! Oh, Freya, it's not gonna work like that! You're not gonna Unexist. First you'll start to feel really sick. And then your organs will start to liquefy basically. And you'll start to bleed out! I can feel it! My liver. It's already starting to liquefy. Oh, don't be a drama queen. It's gonna not happen yet! Not until the time door disappears. What? The time door disappears?! Yeah, and then after 12 hours, we disappear. Oh, my God. Freya? Killian. Who's Killian? Uh... Freya, that's Edgar. I can't believe it's really you. Are you okay, my love? I told you she wasn't well. He looks exactly like... Who? Killian! No, he doesn't. Yes, he does. Who is Killian? He looks exactly like Edgar Allen Poe. I am Edgar Allen Poe. How am I the only one seeing this? Freya, I've been sick with worry about you. I'm fine. Wendy : She's fine. We got to go! Find something. In the dressing room! We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Oh, Freya... My sweet Freya. My sweet Freya. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. (Crying quietly) I love you. My God. Is it a shifter? No, hon. It's me. I need the Anima Aucupe. Thank you. 
 
 Hello, Joanna. What the hell are you doing here, you son of a bitch? Your father sent me. With strict orders to kill you. Get out of my way. Not until I get what I want. Aperi. Sorry, Joanna. (Quietly): Oh, my God. Okay, I don't understand. He looked exactly like Killian. I'm sorry, honey, I just don't see it. But how do you not see it? He's the spitting image... Of Edgar Allen Poe. Ah, I'm starting to lose my mind. Oh, I bet I know What it is. What? You can recognize his soul. That's a thing? Sure. You said it yourself: You did that spell to remember your past lives, and in every life, you come across Killian and you fall in love. That's obviously one of your gifts. You can recognize his soul even when it's in another incarnation. Oh. That actually makes sense. In a bizarre sort of way. Honey, bizarre is where we live. Wendy : Yes, I know. I'll be right down. Oh, my God, hide. Just wait for me at the bar. (Very quietly): Ah, the key. (Gasps) (Mouths) How did you not know that you had the key this whole time? Oh, I'm sorry, Freya. After you killed me, I guess that wasn't the biggest thing to happen to me that day. There's a spell to switch bodies with another witch. There's one to control the mind of a human that ends in the human's demise. Okay, does anything sound powerful enough to stop your grandfather? No, not yet. I need to take these home. I can study them. I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? What if your grandfather finds them? I mean, if he's already suspicious, that would be bad. Just leave them. Dash, no. I won't turn into a demon. I swear. I won't even open them. I trust you, but I don't know if I trust these books. Ingrid, I won't even read them until you get back. Okay. I really should get home. I will be back as soon as I can. Okay, I'll be waiting. You're falling asleep, aren't you? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm out of my mind, I'm so tired. I know, but you heard what Ingrid said. You just need to hold on a little longer and wait for me. I know. I know. Stay alive! I am! Killian, please! Killian! Freya! Stay alive. And wait for me. ♪ ♪ Oh, thank you. How we gonna get the key from her? She's you. I thought maybe you would have some ideas. Wendy : Ah, it's so tricky. You can't change anything from the past,even if you want to. Freya : I know.What has happened has already happened, will always happen, blah, blah, blah. The thing is, is I never remember taking the key from myself, so obviously I didn't do it, and I never saw you again in this life, because you were already dead, so you didn't get it from me, either. What happens if neither one of us gets the key? What if we never get the key? All right, all right, calm down. We'll think of something. There's a few more minutes before your mom gets here. I have been looking for you guys everywhere. Mom...  What are you doing here? I told you to meet me at the time door. Well, the thing is... we came inside because it looked like it was gonna rain. There's been a complication. - What? I lost the Anima Aucupe. What? How? Well, the minute I got it back from myself, Tarkoff took it. Wait, Tarkoff? He's here? Yes. And he vanished before I could get it back from him. Okay, we-we... we have a complication of our own and you're gonna be really, really mad. There he is. Joanna : All right, go to the time door and I will meet you there in ten minutes. Wait, mom... I am gonna finish this once and for all. No, wait...  Mom, mom! Oh... I'm happy to see you. Maybe now we can have a civilized conversation. I'm not here to talk. Ah! Careful. This is a fragile piece of workmanship. You wouldn't want to damage it. You're never gonna win this. Not without me. What are you suggesting? Let's kill him. Together. (Laughing): You're not making sense. We defeat the king. He won't stand a chance against the both of us. And then you and I will go back to Asgard. Together. Is that what you want? We can be a team, Joanna. We could beat him. I'm offering you your only chance. I'd rather die. Oh, Joanna. Why do you always have to do things the hard way? Whatever happened to Poe, anyway? He died shortly after you did. Drank himself to death. That's awful. I know. He loved you. Your death broke his heart. I should go talk to him. Say something, make him feel better. Wait, come here. No. You can't. Why? Because it wouldn't change anything. He died over 160 years ago. It's already happened, remember? We can't change the past even when we're standing in it. But that is Killian. Or his soul, anyway. I don't want him to suffer and die because of me. I know, honey. It's tragic. (Sighs) But it's done. (Gasps) What? Oh, my God. I just remembered. Poe hit on me the night that you died. Huh? Oh, I didn't understand why, then, but now I get it. Yeah, I'm not following. Okay, this is what you need to do. May I? Of course. You look... Different. Exactly. You've been saved, haven't you? They drove the spirit of Ambrose out of you. I knew they could do it. No, not exactly. I'm not the same Freya you knew. I'm a... newer model. I'm afraid I don't follow. But, then again, knowing your family, there's very little that can surprise me anymore. Freya : I know I look like your Freya, but I'm not. Just like you look like someone else, to me, but you're not him, either. Killian. That's what you kept calling me. And you love him? I do, but he's really far away right now. I'm sorry. That's okay. Because I'm here with you right now. And I need your help. (Doorbell rings) These late night visits are becoming a habit. Actually, this visit is business not pleasure. Okay. Come on in. Hell of a place. Know anything about the man that built it? Of course. Can I get you a drink? His name was Archibald Browning. Wealthy industrialist around the turn of the century. He was actually a distant relative. Did you know that fair haven is rumored to be a gathering place for witches? News to me. Hmm. Story goes Browning was a warlock. And he built this place so he could practice occult ceremonies. Occult ceremonies? Blood rites... Animal sacrifices... Devil worship. I mean, if these walls could talk. Right? Too bad they can't. You know all the information I just gave you is public record? A lot of people in town know about it. It's part of local culture. And yet you claim to not know word one. So, what are you saying? I think whoever committed these murders, was into the same sorts of stuff as Archibald Browning was. I mean, he carved symbols into the bodies of his victims. Oh, I know. I saw them. I watched them die. East End is turning out to be a very strange place with a very strange history. And you just happen to be living right in the exact center of it all. Are you sure there's nothing you want to tell me? Actually there is. What? Go... Upstairs. And take off your clothes. Wendy : Oh, honey, I need a drink. Thank you. My goodness. Wendy, dear, you are looking quite fetching tonight. Oh, thank you... whoa! (Wendy gasping) Hmm... Edgar! Oh, you did it! If my literary career doesn't pan out, I reckon I can find a second career as a pickpocket. Thank you, Edgar. I owe you. Anything for you, Freya. I have to go. Freya, please. I can't. I'm sorry. Ooh, yeah. Got to go. (Groans) Freya : Good-bye, Edgar! Bye. (Door opens, closes) Ingrid. Grandfather? Yes. It is me. But I have now fully transformed. (Laughs) Are you feeling all right? Oh, yes, my child. Never felt better. Did you enjoy your visit? With Dash? I don't know what you're talking about. Vinculum. (Screams) What are you doing to me? I know exactly where you were. Now, let's discuss your punishment. You never intended to go back to Asgard. Yes, I did. Did you think that was funny? Teasing your poor old grandfather like that? Of course I want to go with you. It's my home. It's where I belong. You used to be a better liar. I'm not lying. (Door open, closes) Frederick! Frederick! She wasn't at the library. Oh, Ingrid is resting upstairs. Ingrid (Distorted, echoing): Frederick, I need your help! Well, I'm glad she came back. You know, maybe I was wrong about her and Bastian. Deep down, Ingrid has the best heart of all of us. Oh,of course she does. Ingrid (Distorted, echoing): Frederick,please help me! Ingrid is a good girl. Always does the right thing. We're so close, grandfather. We'll be home soon. ♪ ♪
