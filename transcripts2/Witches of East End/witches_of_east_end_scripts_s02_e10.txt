 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 And in almost every life I've had, I've met you. 
 KILLIAN: So I was right, we are connected. You're my soul mate and I love you. INGRID: No one will ever find the body. The king sent me through the portal. What does he want? FREDERICK: Just to talk to you. We can't let you bring back the king. It's too late, it will happen. I was right, you are the one. I left you a present in the garden. (sobbing softly) It was Tarkoff. I couldn't do anything. Leave. Now. You don't understand. Stop. No more excuses. No more explanations. Just go. Mom... Go! Unless you want to join your sisters in the Underworld. (sobbing): I can't do it again. It happened again. ♪ ♪ Go ahead. Just do it. You would, if you were in my position. Then what are you waiting for? You want me to, don't you? That's how miserable you've become. You can go to hell. But not with my help. You need to drink this. I don't need a sedative. It'll ease your pain. I don't want to ease my pain. The girls are dead, and I'll never see them again. Yes, you will. They'll look the same, but... each new one's different. You know as well as I do that this version of them is gone forever. Johanna, I'm willing to give up my last life. For one of them? Which one? Who would you choose? It's just not an answer. Okay. Um, I know what you're gonna say, but just hear me out. We could try the ostium temporis. No, it... The time door won't solve anything. We can use it to go back, but we can't change the past. Even if we do get to go back, nothing will ever change. It's too late. There must be another way. There isn't. What you need right now is rest. Okay. (sniffles) I need rest. Thank you, Wendy. ♪ ♪ You're a son of a bitch, you know that? Man, I don't know what your problem is with me, but get over it. I-I... I can't get over it. I'll never forget what you did to me. I didn't do anything. Whatever happened is another life. Back off. You know, they think it's all my fault, because I betrayed them. But they don't know that you're the one who led me down that path 400 years ago. You were bad for Freya back in Asgard, and you're bad for her now. Okay, I think it's time you stop drinking. You're not making any sense. Jeff, cut him off. Yeah, that's gonna bring them back. Take it easy! What happened to her is all your fault! Yeah? It's always your fault. ♪ ♪ INGRID (recorded): Hi, this is Ingrid. Please leave a message, and I'll call you back. (knocking) Killian, what happened to you? I need to see Freya. Wait, no. Killian, stop. Frederick freaked out on me at the bar. I know something's going on. I need to talk to her. You can't. Freya? There's something I need to tell you. Freya. Freya? ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Sectis profundus. Quieverunt. ♪ ♪ (gasps) ♪ ♪ (water dripping steadily) Diruo pessum. (sobbing softly) (sniffles) FREYA (recorded): It's Freya. You know what to do. It's Freya. You know what to do. ♪ ♪ What the... No. Sana. (skin sizzling) Sana. Sana. Welcome back. No. What did you do? I saved you. I was dead. I was with the girls. You weren't dead, Joanna. You were dreaming. I would be dead right now if it wasn't for you. Let's get something straight. You're not leaving me here alone. That's not your decision to make. I want to die, and I'm ready to go. You're grieving, honey; you're not thinking this through. I'm done, Wendy. I'm done with curses, I'm done with living forever, and I am done watching my girls die. It took 400 years, but Father finally won. He can't win unless you let him. (sighs) Get out. Why? So you can kill yourself again? I'm not leaving here until you take this. And then I'm taking away all sharp objects, and I'm locking you in this room. You are such a pain in the ass. I love you, too. Open. There. Satisfied? Now get out. You wish. Scoot over. I'm not leaving until I know that you're asleep. Even when they'll be right in front of me, I'll be missing who they were. ♪ ♪ (knocking) The hell do you want? Just to talk. Not interested. I know. I get... I get that you're pissed. All right? So am I, but we're the only family we've got left. (scoffs) So what? You want to... do you want to hug it out? I messed up. I need your help. Or your advice. I-I don't know. I just... I didn't know where else to turn. You're unbelievable. Hasn't even been one day. Now she's dead, and you got no one else to bail out your sorry ass. Who's dead? Ingrid. What? You heard me. I-Ingrid's dead? Freya, too. Thought you knew. How? I don't know the details. Okay, so maybe it's not true. I saw their bodies. It's true. They're gone. The last thing I care about is what you need right now. What do you want? Oh, this is so not gonna work for me. Caffeine emergency. Thanks. Valens. Drink. (groans softly) Yeah, I know. It's jarring. But I had to sober you up quick. We need to talk. You just kicked me out of the family. Now you want to chat? Oh, my feelings for you haven't changed. But I just pulled your mother out of a bathtub full of blood, and I need your help. Is she okay? She's alive. I've given her something to sleep. But she's definitely not okay. Two of her children are dead, and the other one betrayed her, yet again. We need to find Tarkoff. For what, revenge? I told you, I already tried to kill him. It's harder than you'd think. No, I don't want to kill him. That's not gonna solve the problem. I can't believe I'm saying this, but... you need to complete the ritual to get my father here. He's the only one powerful enough to bring the girls back without consequences. Once Grandfather comes through, there's no guarantee he'll do what we want. You realize that, don't you? We don't have any other choice. We have to take the risk. KILLIAN: What the hell is your deal? Amor verdadero. From the hottie at the bar. Take it back. WAITRESS: Okay. Damn. I hope you at least got a few good shots in. Not interested. Clearly. Then keep moving. To where? I'm new here. Any suggestions? Mmm. That's a lot better than the crap I sent over. Go play your games with someone else. My games beat sitting here trying to numb your pain. A friend of mine died tonight. We ought to make the most out of that fact. Are you seriously propositioning me? The day of my brother's funeral, I went out, got drunk, picked up a guy at a bar, had the best s*x of my entire life. Yeah, that's one way to grieve. This is mine. I just hate to see someone hurting themselves when there's someone who could do it for them. Is that what turns you on? You want to find out? If you're a sadist, no thanks. Look, instead of sitting here, trying to forget, let's go have a night to remember. I won't bite. Actually, I can't make that promise. What do you say? You up for it? 
 
 ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ If you're having second thoughts, we don't have to do this. No, we do have to do this. You worried about Tarkoff? Screw Tarkoff. That asshole doesn't scare me. It's Tommy. The thing that made Tommy Tommy is already gone. He's still alive, but his mind's dead. He's just a vessel now. I know. It's just... the thought of actually seeing him like this. But there's no other way. TARKOFF: Like lambs to the slaughter. Pull up a chair. I've been expecting you. ♪ ♪ (doorbells jingle) (quietly): Okete ilu awa orerereo. Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha. Okete ilu awa orerereo. Okete ilu awa orerereo. Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha. Okete ilu awa orerereo. Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha. Okete ilu awa orerereo. Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha. What do you want, Killian? You know why we're here. Let's just do this. Just do this? Where's the fun in that? We get it. We need your help, and you hold all the cards. Most of the cards. We have the king. I like your aunt. She knows how to behave. You could learn a lot from her. Don't mistake expediency for respect. Because let's be clear, when this is all over, you're gonna wish you hadn't met me. Pity you can't kill me with your thoughts, isn't it? Okay. Everyone has a stake here. Tarkoff, you serve the king. You want him here more than we do. We're not gonna beg. How about a "please"? Will you help us bring back the king... please? That's a good kitty. Now, was that so hard? (gasps) You okay? I need a minute alone with him. Make it quick. I'm so sorry that you got mixed up in this. I should've spelled you when I had the chance. I know that you're still in there somewhere. And I'm never gonna give up on you. I promise. (crying softly) Wow. I don't usually... Screw women in public? Yeah. No. I'm.... That's not what I was gonna say. Are you seriously flustered right now? I mean, that's almost cute. I thought we just had a good time. More like a good start. At least you kept up. You are so full of sh1t. Relax, cowboy. How's your nipple? How's your ass? Touché. Look, I'm starving. You want to get something to eat? And, what, get to know each other over a short stack and some bacon? Give me your phone. You need a date for prom, don't call me. You want to screw someone after prom, you got my number. The vessel is prepared to receive his glory. Take your position. No time for second thoughts. I knew eventually we'd see eye to eye. Hugr krellr náttúra hefja nú. Nema hirzla et hvat ykkarr. (grunting) Eigna inn líkami eoa próask. Hvarfa optar. Stíga nú. (screaming) (panting) Tommy? Hello... my darling daughter. (gasps) Your Grace, I am your humble servant. I never gave you permission to lay a finger on my granddaughters. My apologies, Your Grace... Oh, Wendy, it's been so long. I could've waited a little longer. Still my spirited daughter. Nothing's changed. Except, of course, uh, that necklace. You're on your last life. We should do something about that. Ah, my boy. Hello, Grandfather. You have nothing to fear. I understand you became confused after your journey through the portal. Everything's different than you thought it would be. Being with your mother again and sisters, it was intoxicating. It's okay, my boy. Tarkoff... Tortured you. He overstepped the bounds. I shall deal with him. I know the carnage it took to bring me here weighs heavily upon you. You were always... a gentle child. I love you. I love you, too, Grandfather. Of course you do. Now, come here. Sleep well, my angels. We'll be together again soon. What are you doing down here? I drugged you and locked you in. Well, the elixir wore off, and I wanted to see the girls, so... I picked the locks. Okay, there's something that I need to tell you. Hello, Joanna. Wendy, what have you done? Okay, don't freak out. We did it for a very good reason. You two worked together on this? Mom, we had to. How could you? How could you bring this man into our home?! He's gonna bring the girls back. I'd almost forgotten how beautiful they were. I'm here to help. You don't help without strings attached, and you know that as well as I do. Okay, this isn't the way that I saw it playing out either, but I had to do something. You were upstairs carving your arms. You always had a flair for the dramatic, even as a child. Shut the hell up! Such a mouth! Just hear him out, mom. There's no other way. Stop it! Your servant Tarkoff did this. How am I supposed to believe he wasn't just following your orders? NIKOLAUS: Oh, Joanna. Did you really think I went to all this trouble to come back just to see you... any of you... dead? If that was my goal, I could have achieved it a million other ways. I do regret what has happened. And you should know... I'm back here to put the family together, not tear them apart. He can bring the girls back, Joanna. He's the only one who can. (speaking Spanish) I mean, I don't mean to bother you, but, um... Uh, my Spanish isn't so great. Eva? Eva Callero. We were... She was my wife. Where is she now? She's dead. I should kill you. Why is that everyone's go-to today? Wait here, brujo. If what you say is true, the journey from here on will not be an easy one. Gildi koerr dótturson út daudr vio saellifor. Ek bjóda sem fylkir. Vaka af hafi fólkvangr. (both gasping) Mom? What just happened? I thought we lost you. You were dead. Mom, while I was dead, my soul was here, trapped in the house. You couldn't see me, but I saw you. I saw everything. FREYA: And I was on some strange boat... on a river. It was dark and foggy and really creepy. Sweetie, that's the Underworld. No place for a granddaughter of mine. This is our grandfather? The one you guys are always talking about? I thought you hated him. I'm sorry. It's just, they always said they hated you. WENDY: Oh, no, we still hate him, but he's the one who brought you back, so things have become quite awkward. Thank you. But how? I mean, I thought there were consequences. For most, maybe, but, um... not for me. I have missed you all, and I know you have missed home. Let's put the bad blood behind us and mark today as a new beginning. JOANNA: You're asking us to forgive a lot, to forget about a lot. We must never forget our past. Remembering our mistakes prevents us from repeating them. Not that you would ever lie, but how can we trust you, Father? I am old. My magic may be strong, but my body is weak. I simply want my loved ones around me again. Please, come home. It's time for the family to heal. There is something I must know about you. Cover one of these with your hand... now. (groaning) Es el. (Killian sighs) (groaning) Sana. You look just like... I know. Eva was my great-grandmother. I know why he was sent to us. First, you tried to stop Tarkoff because you didn't want the king to come here, and now you're a true believer? I believe he did the right thing. He brought Ingrid and Freya back, and I've believed in the good in him for a long time. I know it's still there. Frederick, he tortured you. It's not that simple. Ah, he abused me, you're right, but he realized he was wrong, and eventually he set me free. That's why I carried him with me through the portal. He's changed. I know he has, and it took him a long time. He's clever. He's been ill. Very ill. And it finally made him stop and think about what he'd done to all of us, and I know he regrets it. Look, I think this is our chance for a new beginning. At what cost? How many people in East End had to die in order to get him here? No, that's exactly why I didn't want to go through with it. I hated killing innocents, and I hated the cost of finding a host, but Grandfather's here now. And we're lucky he is, 'cause he saved your daughters. Just... please just go talk to him. (groans softly) (groaning) (line ringing) (cell phone ringing) This is Moreau. DASH: So that's your name. Morning, cowboy. What are you doing tonight? You, 10:00. That's a good answer. I'll text you where. Oh, someone likes giving orders. Only 'cause you're so good at taking them. (indistinct police radio chatter) What do we got? Fish bait. Best guess, he's been in the water about a month. Anything carved in his chest? No, not like the others. What's he covered in, tar? You'd think, but no. It's thiner than tar. Smells like sulfur. I'll send it to the lab. So who is he? No I.D., but the teeth are intact. Shouldn't take too long. I'm not going anywhere. You're taking jewelry? Should we all grab something sentimental? No. We got to leave right now. Mom, is this for real? Are we really going to Asgard? Oh, God, no, we're not going to Asgard. We're going to the past. So, now we're gonna use the time door? Time door? We have a time door? What's a time door? You already said we can't change the past. We can't, but that's not why we're going back. There's something that I need to get. You need to get something from the past? It's-it's something I used to own. I need to go back and get it from myself. It's already happened, actually. I just need to complete the circle. Wait. What? What are you talking about? Your grandfather hasn't embraced the family. It's all lies. I know him. He's buttering us up for something. I just don't know what. But he brought us back to life. I know, but you don't know him like I do. We don't know him at all. But we know Mom, and we have to trust her. We got to leave this instant. Patere nos introitum. Wendy, go first. Here, hold hands. Here. Here, take my hand. Come on. I'm staying. Ingrid, no! (whooshing) Where is Ingrid? Holy sh1t, I remember this place. Where the hell are we? Come on, we don't have a lot of time.
