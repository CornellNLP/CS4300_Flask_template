 Previously on Witches of East End 
 It worked! Wait. Don't go away. 
 I suck at this. 
 Archibald Browning. The man who built this place back in the early 1900s. 
 You only killed my eldest daughter. 
 Ingrid was reborn. 
 WENDY: Remember, I've known you for over several centuries, and you're probably the most gifted one of us all. 
 JOANNA: All of our kind must abide. We never reveal ourselves. 
 I'm going to be your sister-in-law, and I want you and my husband... 
 I can't watch you with him. 
 (electrical popping) 
 FREYA (gasps): Killian! 
 The electrical system at the bar went haywire. 
 Just doing my job. 
 Secrets are poison in a relationship, don't you agree? 
 ♪ 
 Whoa. 
 (gasps) 
 Hey. 
 Oh, my God... 
 What are you doing here? 
 Swimming. 
 Yeah. 
 That much I can figure out. 
 Beauty  and  brains. 
 Quite the combination. 
 (chuckles) Tell me something. Have you always been a smart-ass? 
 Pretty much. 
 Seriously, what are you doing in my pool? 
 Penelope said I could use 
 her  pool whenever I want. 
 It beats the freezing cold ocean, so... 
 You call her Penelope? You know that's really weird, right? 
 She's your mom. 
 Really? 'Cause right now it sounds like  you're  my mom. 
 So, does this mean you come here often? 
 Is that a line? Are you trying to pick up on me? 
 (scoffs) 
 Please. You wish. 
 You're right. I do. 
 Uh... I wish you wouldn't say things like that. 
 Come on, I'm just messing around. 
 I know. I... 
 It's not just that, I-I feel like you're waiting for me or something. 
 And I don't want you to. 
 I'm not waiting. 
 But I hear you, loud and clear. 
 I don't recall your doctor giving you permission to swim yet. 
 Uh, I'm fine. 
 DASH: Well, you suffered a profound electric shock last week. 
 And yet I feel like a thousand bucks. 
 Yeah. That's not a lot of money, Killian. 
 Well, maybe not to you. 
 But you know what? 
 I'd like you to come by the hospital this afternoon so I can take a look at you. 
 Say... 1:00? 
 'Kay, Dad. 
 So, you guys are just cool now? 
 No, not really. 
 But, like, I've missed him all these years, and if there's a way we can even have a halfway normal relationship, I might as well try. 
 What can I say? He's my little brother. 
 You know, you are the best person I've ever met. 
 The best? 
 The best. 
 Wow. 
 Ingrid Beauchamp. 
 (laughs): Mrs. Gardiner! 
 Just the woman I wanted to see. 
 Can I help you with a book? 
 No, but I've come bearing gifts for you. 
 As you know, renovations at Fair Haven have been ongoing, and we've unearthed quite a few gems from the past. 
 Oh... 
 One in particular... 
 I thought you'd be interested in. 
 Wow. That's... 
 PENELOPE: Uncanny, right? I could hardly believe it when I saw it. 
 She looks exactly like you, Ingrid. 
 A little, I guess, around the eyes. 
 She could be your twin. 
 This woman must have been a relative of yours, don't you think? 
 Definitely. Yes. 
 I know my family has lived in this town for a long time, so that would make sense. 
 I wonder who she was. 
 And why she looks so troubled. 
 You think she looks troubled? 
 I do. 
 ♪ 
 Season 1, Episode 6 
 "Potentia Noctis" 
 All right, remember what I taught you. 
 Right. 
 Deep breath... Set your intention... 
 And let it out. 
 Holy crap! I did it! 
 You did it! (squeals) 
 I am so proud of you. 
 You're at a whole another level with this stuff. 
 I know. It's incredible. It's like I'm... Suddenly stronger. 
 And I feel more in control of my life. 
 I told Killian to move on. 
 I did! And he was shirtless at the time, so you know I meant it. 
 Why was he shirtless? 
 We were in the pool. Get your mind out of the gutter. 
 Okay. Good for you. 
 It's like there's nothing I can't do right now. 
 Can you put out fires? 
 'Cause I think you started one. 
 (laughs) 
 Maybe I'm  too  powerful? 
 Yeah. That... yeah, that's what you are. 
 (exhales) 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Well, I don't think there's anything we  can  do. 
 What if she figures out it's me? 
 (laughs): Ingrid. I don't think anyone's gonna look at that hundred-year-old photograph and decide that it means you're a secret witch under an ancient curse that causes you to be reborn again and again. 
 You said it yourself. She assumed it's a relative. 
 What's going on? 
 Uh, Penelope found an old photograph of Ingrid at Fair Haven. 
 Oh. And you're worried she's gonna figure out it's you? 
 Cool bathing suit. 
 I don't know. It's just, I know that it's me, but I don't know anything about my other lives, and I'm starting to get curious. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 Who is that little girl I'm with? 
 Why was I hanging out at Fair Haven? Did I know Archibald Browning? 
 Not really. It's... not really... 
 Worth getting into that. 
 No. 
 I can tell there's more to this. Why don't you want me to know? 
 I don't want you to be defined by all your other lives. 
 I don't want you to carry the baggage of all your mistakes. 
 What mistakes?! 
 Uh-oh. 
 Fine. Don't tell me. 
 She's not gonna stop. 
 You know how determined she is. Should we just tell her the truth? 
 If we tell her, she may never forgive you. 
 You really want to risk that? 
 ♪ (sighs) 
 All right, big breath in. 
 Out. 
 All right. 
 Sounds good. But you should have a full blood panel done. 
 I oddly miss these lectures. 
 Feels like old times. 
 (sighs) You got a long way to go before it's like old times again. 
 But... seeing you almost die did put things in perspective. 
 Just promise me you'll get a checkup, all right? 
 How about if I just promise not to get electrocuted again? 
 Deal? 
 (sighs) 
 Dr. Gardiner? 
 I ran some tests on the mass you pulled from Maura Thatcher's throat. 
 It appears to be made of some sort of organic, spongy osseous tissue. 
 But get this, it... 
 Oh, God, I didn't realize you had a patient in here. I am so sorry. 
 No, no, it's okay. We're finished. Amy, this is my brother, Killian. 
 Killian, Dr. Matthews, MD, PhD, medical research superstar. 
 (laughs) 
 Um, we can finish this later. 
 Oh, hey, don't leave 'cause of me. 
 I love a good organic, spongy, osseous tissue story. 
 (laughs): Oh. Well, who doesn't? 
 So, I didn't know Dr. Gardiner had a brother. 
 Yeah, he likes to keep that quiet. But here I am. 
 Yep, and here you go. 
 I've got work to do. Shockingly, you're not my only patient today. 
 Really nice to meet you, Amy. 
 You, too. Yeah. 
 (laughs) 
 ♪ 
 How is that possible... 
 Ingrid, guess what? 
 Oh. What are you doing? 
 Falling down the rabbit hole. 
 What do you mean? 
 Penelope found this picture of me at Fair Haven, and I'm with this little girl who looks strangely familiar, but Mom won't tell me who it is; you know how she gets about the past, so I thought, hey, I don't need Mom, I'm a researcher... I'll just do some research. 
 And that's how I figured out it was Athena. 
 What was Athena? 
 The little girl in the picture was Athena. Browning. 
 As in Archibald. You know, the man who built Fair Haven. 
 Satanist, cult leader. 
 Yeah, I don't get it. 
 Athena is Archibald's daughter. Do you have any water? 
 (laughs): I'm really thirsty. And that rhymed. 
 Ingrid, is there anything else in these brownies besides chocolate? 
 Exactly! 
 That is the point! 
 What is the point? 
 Of the entire endeavor. Try to keep up. 
 See, when I realized who the little girl was, I thought, holy sh1t, what does this have to do with me, ...and why doesn't Mom want me to know? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Then I thought: I'm a witch; I'll just cast a spell. 
 A spell to help me remember So I searched the Grimoire, and I found this recipe, which I messed with a little, and then I did it... a spell to help me remember my life from 1906... I baked it into this brownie. 
 And? 
 I'm pretty sure it's bunk. 
 I've eaten the entire pan. I don't really feel a thing, except I'm a little agitated. Do you want to try one, see if it works on you? 
 No! No. Thank you. That's tempting. But I'm gonna meet Dash, and then I'm gonna go to work. 
 Okay. You let me know how that goes, okay? 
 (sighs) 
 Thanks for nothing, magic brownie. 
 (gasps) 
 (quietly): Ingrid.

 You are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen. 
 (exhales) 
 (panting) 
 I love you, Archibald. 
 Okay, these test results can't be right. 
 I didn't think so either. 
 So I ran them again. And again and again... 
 Are you sure the tissue sample wasn't compromised? 
 I'm gonna pretend like you didn't just ask me that question. 
 It's not you I'm questioning. These test results are unscientifically possible. 
 Well, I did find an example of a similar phenomenon in an obscure medical journal. 
 Apparently, in 1995, a woman in rural Louisiana presented in a small county E.R. with severe throat pain and obstructed breathing. 
 They found one of these growing out of her windpipe. 
 And it was idiopathic? 
 Yep. Although she claims it was because she was cursed by a voodoo priestess. 
 Okay, maybe we should contact that hospital and cross-reference our findings. 
 We can't. Get this. 
 The admitting doctor and two researchers all died of severe lung infections three weeks after the incident. 
 The hospital was demolished due to an apparent asbestos contamination. 
 The sample was never recovered. 
 Well, that's not very helpful. 
 No. 
 (knocking) FREYA: Hello. 
 Can I come in? 
 Hey, babe. 
 Freya, so good to see you. 
 Hi. (groans) 
 What is that thing? 
 That is a medical mystery. 
 But I'm gonna solve it. 
 Where'd it come from? 
 Oh, I pulled it out of Maura Thatcher's throat the day she freaked out on your family at the Bent Elbow. 
 You did? 
 Hey, maybe she was cursed by a voodoo priestess. 
 What?! 
 (chuckles) 
 She's kidding. Look, why don't we take a break? 
 Maybe we should grab some lunch? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, no. 
 (exhales) 
 Archibald. 
 I got another letter from Freya! 
 She's settled in San Francisco and says she's met the love of her life. 
 (chuckles) What else is new? 
 Oh, I miss her so. 
 Edith, tell me what the problem is. 
 My hands are so sore I can barely lift 'em. 
 And I'm afraid they'll never work again. 
 Well, not to worry. 
 Wendy will mix you just the right salve. 
 And in the meantime, close your eyes, Edith. 
 (quietly):  Sana manus mulieris huius. 
 Sana manus mulieris huius. Oh, my. It's much better. (gasps) Like... magic. It's just a little healing technique I picked up in Europe. Oh... Oh... Edith, this is the ointment that you rub on your hands twice daily. Oh, thank you. You three really are miracle-workers. (chuckles) Thank you, Edith. (whistles softly) Joanna... You're looking well. That'll be two dollars. Mm. Oh, uh, one more thing. One of my disciples has fallen ill. I'm looking for an herb. It's called  feverfox . I've never heard of it. Hmm. I believe I've seen it here on your shelves. It's a... it's a bluish powder. No. My sister's right. We don't stock  feverfox . It's illegal and rather toxic in the wrong hands. Hmm. I thought you'd never heard of it. She hasn't. I have. We can't help you. Of course. Well, I'll be going, then. You ladies really must pay a visit to Fair Haven. It's finally complete, and I think you'll be impressed with what we're doing. It is the next level of being for our kind. No, thank you. We're good. ARCHIBALD: As you wish. Ingrid? Good to see you. (moaning) FREYA: Hey, what's up? Should we be worried about this? (gasps) Where did you get that? At the hospital. Why? What is it? Ramus mortium,  branch of death. You touch it, you die. (gasps) What? (moaning) What if it's too late? Ramus mortium sickness takes a few weeks to kick in. (sniffs) So we have time. We'll fix it. And when it does kick in? You know that, uh, drippy metallic-y stuff ...that was on the branch? Yeah. Uh-huh. That slowly but surely fills up your lungs until you drown from within. Why would you tell me that? You asked. You didn't have to answer that honestly. (groans) Oh, my God. This is all your fault. You were the one that put the spell on Maura. No, no, no. This is something much bigger, much darker. I bet it happened when the shifter attacked her. So why isn't Maura dead if this thing is so toxic? She's the host. It grew from within, so she's immune. You on the other hand... Oh, yeah, I know. I'm infected. Okay, Freya, I'm gonna need you to listen to me. I'm not gonna lie to you. Ramus mortium  sickness is bad. Really bad. I've seen people die from it. I've seen you die from it 300 years ago, so I'm gonna need you to suck it up. Wow. This is the world's shittiest pep talk. My point is you don't have to die from it. We didn't know how to stop it back then. We do now. This drink is the cure. I'm gonna need you to make it. But why me? Honey, even with all your inexperience, you have a gift for potions. It's in your blood. I'm never gonna be able to make it as good as you. So this branch can kill regular people, too? Anybody who touches it. But this antidote offers protection for a few years... It's kind of like a tetanus shot... Just in case you're re-exposed. So I'm gonna have to get Dash and Amy to take this, too. Yes. And make sure they drink a lot, okay? You'll know that you're cured when your ears start ringing. Freya? Huh? You're gonna save lives, like the ass-kicking witch that you are. Okay. (exhales) (exhales) "...Interruption to his father and mother, "how patiently and kindly so ever they might endure it for his sake..." Ingrid! Athena! Oh... You missed dinner. And you said you were going to braid my hair. I know. I couldn't get away. I'm sorry, but I'll braid it tomorrow. Promise? Mm-hmm. Go get ready for bed, dear. Good night, Daddy. Good night, Ingrid. You were very convincing today. I almost believed you didn't know me. That would be an unthinkable reality. Did you bring the  feverfox ? Good girl. (chuckles) (chuckles) Calliope! Fetch Elizabeth! Elizabeth, I'm glad you decided to go through with this. You won't regret it. Oh, I must admit I'm a little nervous. My brother thinks you all do the devil's work. (chuckles) Your brother is a cretin. Ingrid and myself are superior creatures. You're lucky we're willing to deal with your kind at all, let alone help you the way we are. I see you've, uh, brought the money. This is everything I have. (chuckles) I'm not going to lie. This... will hurt. A lot. Thank you. Close your eyes and drink. INGRID AND ARCHIBALD:  Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum. Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum. Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum. Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum. Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum. Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum. (panting) Did it work? It did. You are young again. You have what you wanted. Thank you so much. I'm forever in your debt. Calliope, tonight's ritual will take place in the pool. Prepare Elizabeth for her initiation. I promise you'll love it, dear. (sighs) Shall we... prepare, as well? ♪ ♪ 
 
 (sighs) So, who's ready for another round? AMY: Oh. Once again, you forget a glass for me. You stick to your root beer. You're our designated driver. Ah, you guys all want to pile onto my motorcycle? I said you could use my car. Thank you for inviting me out tonight, Freya, but I have to tell you, I am a bit of an amateur, and I don't know if I can handle another one of these, um... What are they called? East End Antidote... with a twist. Right. Yeah, I'm pretty drunk from the last three rounds. Hogwash! We are celebrating! What? Did you really just say "hogwash"? Okay, wait. What are we celebrating? We are celebrating the fact that you two are about to solve that whole medical mystery you were working on earlier. What do the other doctors say? Who else is working on it with you? Maybe we should invite them here, maybe have a little brainstorming session? Wow. I think this is the most interest you've shown in my work since the day I met you. Hey, that's not fair. I'm always interested in your work. Hold on, hold on. I didn't mean it like that, all right? All I meant was, is that my job can be stressful, and I like that you are an oasis away from all that. Okay, when I'm with you, I can be happy and just forget about my troubles. But you know that I care about your work. I know you do. And you don't always want to talk about it. You're right. I don't. I'm sorry. It just came out wrong. This is the most delicious drink I think I've ever had. It, um... it tastes like... sunshine. KILLIAN: Wow. AMY: It does! All right, let me see. Give me a sip. Mmm! Hmm? You're right. Sunshine. DASH: Come on, don't be mad. I didn't mean anything by it. I know. I just... You know I'm not just here to take your mind off things, right? I mean, I don't want you to be hiding your problems from me. I can handle it, whatever it is you want to throw at me. I know. I want you to be a part of everything in my life. Good, 'cause that's what I want, too. All right then. So marry me. What? I thought you guys were already getting married. See? Amy does have a PhD. No, no, marry me this weekend. At the courthouse just the two of us. All right, no hassle, no mothers-in-law, no guest list. Just us. You two can be the witnesses. Hell, yes! AMY: That is so romantic! Yeah. Congratulations. Penelope's gonna lose her sh1t. Cheers. AMY: Cheers. (laughter) (bell clangs) MAN: It's last call, people! One more round! Wow. I can't believe it's already last call. We got to keep this party going. Yeah. Who wants to go back to Fair Haven and celebrate? Let's go. Let's do this. Yeah. Cheers. (laughter) (Archibald moaning) We should join the others. I could use a swim. I know. I just like having you to myself sometimes. You can have me whenever you want as soon as you tell your family the truth. That you love me and you're going to be my wife. They will never understand. They'll think you spelled me, that I'm under your control. Hmm. As if I could control you. You're more powerful than I am. Do they really not know how strong you are? They know, but they also believe you're pure evil. Hmm. And what do you think? I believe I was sleepwalking before I met you, and you woke me up. And when the time is right, and we have enough followers to our cause, we can return to where we came from and take back what is rightfully ours. And I will be proud to stand beside you as your wife, and I will not be ashamed. Together, Ingrid, there's nothing we can't do. CALLIOPE: Something's wrong with Elizabeth! She just started shaking, and then... and then, all this blood started pouring out! I don't know what happened! INGRID: We need to do something. My mother can help. She's an excellent healer. There's nothing to be done. She's dead. Oh, poor woman. This is what we get for trying to help an inferior creature. They'll blame us. This could ruin everything. We need to get rid of her body. ARCHIBALD: We can bury her down in the catacombs. They'll be after us now, the ones who don't understand, but we can make this a new beginning. Tonight. Let's marry tonight. Yes. MAN: Where is Elizabeth?! Oh. Elizabeth? Elizabeth?! How did you get in? What have you done with her? You have no right to be here. Be gone. Your sister is fine. Then show her to me. You sister has a right to be left alone. Oh. The good people of this town are on to you. We know you're doing the devil's work. You have no idea what you're talking about. You need to leave. Fine. Then I will take my sister with me, or I will return with 20 men, and we will take her ourselves. Elizabeth is dead. She wanted to be young. I granted her wish. It didn't work out. You killed her?! It was an unfortunate turn of events. And now you're going to kill me? I have no intention of killing you. (grunts) My soon-to-be-wife will do it. Archibald? (panting) Think of it as a wedding gift. I... Please. (grunts) (gasps) You disappoint me, Ingrid. (laughter) DASH: Ooh, wow. Whoa! It's freezing. Calor Aqua. Feels kind of warm to me. Huh. Must have been in a cold spot or something. AMY: Oh! That drink really did a number on me. My ears are ringing. Me, too. Me, too. That's good. It means it's working. What are you talking about? Nothing. I love this room. It's so... Creepy? You think? Oh, definitely creepy. They used to have Satanic s*x rituals here, you know. DASH: All right, you want creepy. You know, the workers just found an entrance to some catacombs underneath the house. I haven't even checked that out yet. Oh, cool. Let's go. What are you doing? I didn't think you were here. Don't do this. Don't do what? I'm just getting some things. I'm taking a trip to visit Freya in San Francisco. You're wearing a wedding dress. Yes, but it's not what it looks like. Ingrid, stop. I know about you and Archibald. I don't know what you're talking about. I thought it was a phase. I had no idea you were in so deep. Ingrid, he doesn't care about you. He's using you. He went after me first, and I didn't fall for it. You shouldn't, either. Why are you lying like this? Ingrid, you can't marry him. He doesn't love you! Just because you use men, and just because you only care about yourself doesn't mean everybody is like you. You're right, he's not like me. He's evil. He cares about our kind. He doesn't want us to have to hide anymore. He's proud of what we are. So we're going to a place where nobody can hurt us. Such a place doesn't exist! If they find out what we are, they will always hurt us. Not if we go back to where we came from! Archibald has found a way through. He's lying. We're leaving tonight after we're married. I'm sorry, Wendy. Yeah, the workmen say this place is basically unchanged since it was built. AMY: Well, I don't like it. What, are you afraid we'll see a ghost? I'm pretty sure we're gonna see a rat. I hate rats. (Freya sighs) You all right? Yeah. I think I'm a little drunk. I  know  you're drunk. But I like drunk Freya... she's fun. Yeah, but drunk Freya has a tendency to do stupid things she regrets the next day. You talking about the engagement party? 'Cause I don't think you were drunk then. Yeah, probably not. So... So, did you really have a dream about me before you met me that night? That's weird, right? We both have dreams about each other before we met. Why have we never talked about that? There are a lot of things we don't talk about. I'm sorry if I ever hurt you. Oh, no. Don't worry about it. We're good. Okay. Good. And congratulations on the whole... eloping thing... I think that's great. I hope you guys are really happy. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Anyway, I'm gonna go check on Amy, in case she runs into any of those... Rogue rodents. (laughs) (long sigh) (liquid dripping) (distorted whispers nearby) (distorted whispers continue) (soft gasp) (distorted whispers continue) (gasps) Whoa. Slow down. Are you okay? (panting): Yeah. Sorry, I'm just feeling a little claustrophobic. (distorted whispers continue) Let's get out of here. (groans) (pants) ♪ Please... please let me go. I can't. I can't let you go. It's not gonna end well. My mind is made up. Let her pass. You may have fooled her, Archibald, but I know exactly what you're up to. All I'm up to is finding a safe haven, so we can live in peace. I was hoping you would join our cause. I'd sooner die. (both gasp) (yells) Very well, then. Care to do the honors this time? Wh-Why don't we just go? She will follow. Kill her. Archibald, I can't. You promised. INGRID: I know, but... Do you love me? Of course I love you. Then kill her... Or I will. (panting) WENDY:  Pila metalli. Pila metalli. Pila metalli! INGRID: Athena! (screaming) (screaming) (panting) Sweetie...? What's happening? I just died. Wendy killed me. (sighs) Wow, we are getting married this weekend. I guess we  are. Of course, the first time I met you, I knew we'd get married. Y-You did not. Are you kidding? No, I-I did. I  did. I walked into the Bent Elbow. I think it was a Tuesday, I'd been in town maybe a week, and... There you were, mixing a drink behind the bar. And I... I don't know, I just had this feeling. It was... Like a wave crashing over my head, and I knew. It's the only time that's ever happened to me in my entire life. It took... all my strength not to just walk over to you and ask you to marry me right then and there. You never told me that. I-I... didn't want you to think I was a freak. Well, you are  my  freak, and I like it. Me, too. ♪ I woke up from a nightmare that you were in danger, and I knew it wasn't a dream, it was a vision. So I got to the shop as fast as I could. I was too late. (gasps) What happened? What did you do to my daughter? Ask your sister. It was an accident. You killed my love. You deserve to die. I'll kill you as many times as it takes! (yells) (low grunt) (gasps) Cultrum incalescere. ATHENA: Daddy! Get out of the way! (Athena screams) (gasps) Cinis Cineris. (screaming) ATHENA (crying): What happened? Where did he go? I'm sorry. You killed my father. Shh. Let it go, let it go. Shh. Breathe. Shh... (crying) (speaks spell) (crying, groaning) (Athena crying quietly) Freya will be dead by morning. They always die on the same day. It was an accident. I was trying to protect her. She was gonna run away with him. Did you know that she was in love with him? (panting): I'm sorry. If you had told me... she was in love with him, then together we could have saved her. And instead, you've killed them both. You know I would never hurt the girls on purpose. But you did hurt them, because you're reckless and dangerous and you act without thinking. (panting) Get out. I never want to see you again. (door closes) And... that was it. I didn't see Wendy again until she turned up on our porch a month ago. And... what happened to Athena? She left town with two women from Archibald's coven. I spelled them so they could never find East End again. I tracked her for years. And she died in the early 1960s. (softly): I loved that little girl. I loved Archibald, too. That spell was so real. It was like I lived through it all again in a matter of hours. I could smell and taste everything. I was  there. But I still can't understand it. How could I have gotten so out of control? We all have darkness inside of us, Ingrid, even the best of us. Even you. (door opens) FREYA: Guys, we have a problem. Besides all the other problems? There's an entire wall of  ramus mortium  in the catacombs of Fair Haven. An entire wall? What the hell is  ramus mortium? What are we gonna do? Has anyone else seen it? No. Then we need to do something about it before somebody does. (liquid dripping) (soft gasp) Whoa. (birds chirping) Hey, sweetie, want to grab some breakfast? No. Uh, thanks. I should get to work. Are you okay? Yes, fine. I'll see you later. ♪ (exhales) Hey. Hey, babe. Are you as hungover as I am? So much more. Crazy night, huh? Very crazy. Hey. Babe, I kind of want to talk to you about the whole elopement thing. Yeah. Yeah, I think we should wait. Me, too. Yeah, if we're gonna do it, let's do it right. We'll have a real wedding, with family and friends. That's exactly what I was gonna say. You see? That's why we're made for each other. PENELOPE: Freya? (soft groan) What's this I hear about an elopement? Well, actually, we're gonna wait. We're gonna do it here, make it big and splashy. Tell the world how we feel about each other. Oh, good. I'm glad you're gonna do it right. You and your family mean so much to me, Freya. I have big plans for you. It's going to be wonderful. I am so excited.
