 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 Dash, you killed a man. 
 (grunting) 
 And I helped to cover it up. This man in your life... you're keeping him at arm's length. You've been hurt a lot. And Dad? He's dead. Your friends killed our father? FREDERICK: They weren't my friends. And I've beaten myself up every day since. I have never been able to read one of your thoughts. Maybe that's a good thing. DASH: Thank you, Freya. For what? For leaving me. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. (moaning) (giggling) Shh. Babe, my family are asleep. You have to be quiet. Okay, shh. (groaning) Freddie? (groaning and wheezing) Freddie? (grunts) Freddie?! Freddie?! What's going on? I think he's having a seizure. (Freddie wheezes) Give me some space. Just wanna help. (Freddie gasping and wheezing) Frederick. Curavi conreptio. Curavi conreptio. (grunts) Cura. Cura... Curavi conreptio. (sighs) Mom? Hmm? Freddie, are you okay? Yeah, babe, I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine. Mom, I'd like you to meet Caroline, my girlfriend. KILLIAN: You think having too much s*x can actually be dangerous? Only one way to find out. (laughing): Okay. Hold on. Let me at least take a shower. Fine. Reject your wife. Go take a shower. You smell like a pig. (sniffs) A pig? Really? Yes. You dare call me a pig?! Yes. (snorting) (giggling) Okay, stop it! Not until you say you love pigs. (laughing): No. Yes, say it! Say it. What's wrong, baby? You okay? Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine. Hey. Hey. Did you know that Frederick's been having seizures? What? He's-he's been having seizures? He told me that you saw him have one three weeks ago. Okay. Yes. All right, yes. He made me promise not to tell you. Okay, we've been trying to cure this together... I don't care! You should have told me. I can't believe that you would keep this secret from me. Oh, as if you haven't kept secrets from me. He's trying to protect you from this. Can't you understand that? Oh, so this is strange... now you're working with Frederick. I thought you didn't trust him. Well, it's possible that I might have been wrong about Freddie. Well, Frederick had another surprise for me last night, and, uh, she was naked. (laughing): Oh, no. Poor Caroline. Wait... you know her? Yeah... yeah, you know that she works at the university? He's been auditing one of her classes. She teaches environmental science. She's actually very smart. No, I didn't know that, because I didn't even know that she even existed, because nobody ever tells me anything. I'm sorry. I've only met her a few times. You've already seen her naked. Oh, completely naked. Anyway, I invited her for a relaxed dinner tonight. Hopefully, clothed. (laughter) Would you like to join us? Sure, yeah. I could use the distraction. Tommy has taken his daughter on a camping trip. I've just been sitting around here all yearny for him. You know that I actually slept with his sweater on my pillow last night, just so I could smell him? You're really in love. Oh, bite your tongue, Joanna. Love is the worst. What do you mean? It's the best thing in the world. No, it's not. Love always ends in pain. Someone either leaves, or dies. I'm sorry. No, no, it's okay. (Ingrid gasps) (laughing): Dash. Hi. What are you doing here? I just, you know, came in to see if you were okay. Oh, I'm the worst. I got your messages, and I-I kept meaning to call you back, but I-I think I've just been in hiding. Hiding from what? Life, reality. Everything. I just come here, shelve books, go home. That way no one gets hurt. Ingrid, listen, what happened with the Mandragora wasn't your fault. Everyone keeps saying that. You can't stay in hiding forever. No. What you need... you need a night out. What do you mean? Look, I'm on the board of the East End Coalition for the Arts, so I have this thing tonight. It's... I don't know... a little... a little drinking, a little dancing... I think it'll be a lot of fun, so... I don't know; what do you say? Would... would you like to come with me? As friends... of course. Of course. Yes, as friends. Okay. Great. So, I'll-I'll meet you there at 7:00? Yes. That sounds great, yeah. Perfect. All right, I'll see you then. I'll see you there. Okay... Okay. Bye. That seizure was scary. You sure you're okay? The doctor ran some tests, but he doesn't think it's serious. He just warned me to reduce my stress. Maybe you can help me with that after dinner tonight. I cannot have dinner with your mother after I flashed her my boobs. It didn't faze her, I promise. My mother is the most non-judgmental person you'll ever meet. She's seen it all. Exactly. She saw it all. (laughs) Come on. She's important to me, and you're important to me. And so, it's important to me that the two of you get to know each other. (sighs) Well, you're important to me, too. I'm late for a class. I'll see you tonight? Yes, okay, fine, I'll have dinner with your mother. I'll just have to wear a burka or something. Bye. Hello, Frederick. Who the hell are you? Afferrentur dolor. What are you doing to me? Remora. I don't want to hurt you, Frederick. I'm here to help you complete your mission. We're going to work together to bring back the king. FREYA: I don't know  how you did this, but you scored yourself an invite to the annual East End Arts Coalition Black-Tie Gala. I did? Yeah. Who's the featured artist this year? I don't know. Some guy named Seamus? Oh, no... no, not the so-called "conceptual, but gritty artist" whose paintings sell for millions of dollars to rich assholes. He keeps his identity secret because, hey, he's mysterious, he's authentic. But, uh, what do I know? I'm just a lowly art teacher. WENDY: I don't understand why I've been invited to this. I don't make millions of dollars. We just have to dress like we do. I'm sorry. We? Oh, I'm your plus one. Okay, this sucks on so many different levels. You know what? I don't even know if I'm going. Come on, Wendy. I need a night out. With cocktails that I'm not serving to other people. Besides, I'm tired of moping around, pining for Killian. Can we please do this? All right, I hear you, girl. But if this invitation is somehow a mistake and we get booted at the door... Then we have a really fun story to tell. That's true. Your, uh, grandfather sent me, Frederick. He's been growing concerned about you and your mission. Thought you might need some help. That's impossible. I'm the only one who can talk to him. I'm a telepath. And a loyal servant to the king. I actually knew your parents, a long time ago, back in Asgard. We were friends. How did you get through the portal? I've been here 400 years, keeping an eye on things for the king. I don't need your help. I've got it under control. I'm working on finding a suitable host. How? You killed the Mandragora, our only means of finding a host body for the king's spirit. I didn't have a choice. He was out of control... murdering people all over town. Well, to make an omelet, you have to kill some people. Look, I'm not accusing you of anything. I really am here to help, but we don't have all the time in the world. We have to find a host as quickly as possible. Okay. How? Step one. What's that? You will prepare this potion, and then slip it into your mother's drink. Why? Your mother is too powerful. Do you know she managed to keep this town cloaked for over 100 years? I'd lost track of her completely. She's dangerous... and smart. The king is concerned she might find a way to interfere with his plans for her daughters. You want your sisters back with you in Asgard, don't you? Of course. You want me to kill her? No. Don't be dramatic. Nobody's asking that. The king would like her alive so he can deal with her in person. The potion will merely weaken her, considerably, so she can't get in our way. And she won't suspect a thing. It's another way to ensure the plan succeeds. The king wants this done tonight. Will that be a problem? Not at all. Well, how do I look? Like trouble. Calm down, Joanna. It's just gonna be a night full of free booze and microwaved canapés. Oh, please. An anonymous admirer sent you that invitation with a private note instructing you to meet him at the bar. How do you know that? Nobody tells me anything, so I snooped. (gasps) I know you're intrigued. I'm curious. Curiosity killed the cat. I'm just doing this for Freya. Things are going well with you and Tommy. Don't screw it up. (scoffs) Whoa. (chuckles) Did your closet explode? I have nothing to wear to this thing tonight. You're going? To the gala? Yeah. Wait, are you? Dash invited me, and I've been feeling really weird about it so I just wanted to check with you and make sure that's all right. You're going on a date with Dash? No, it's not a date. We're just... friends. Well... yeah, I do mind, actually. Wait, what? I don't want you to go. You can't be serious. You came here to ask me if I'm okay with it, and I'm not okay with it. But Dash and I are just friends, and you aren't together anymore, Freya. I don't trust him. Something's up with him. He's changed. Yeah. He has changed. He's like us now. No, it's no like that. He said some really awful things to me the last time I saw him. You mean when he had venom in his brain, which made him temporarily psychotic? He told me he had done things that would make me shudder. I believe him. Okay, that's crazy. You don't know what you're talking about, Freya. What is that? Dash bought me a dress. Really. Is it couture? I don't know. Maybe. He did that for me on our second date. I would say this is somewhat more than friendly, Ingrid. Look, I have to go get ready. What, you're going? Yes, I am. Fine! Have fun! You, too. (sighs) (knocking) (knocking continues) Whoa, whoa. Can't a guy get a little privacy? Just... making sure you're okay. I'm great. I'll be out in a minute. Okay. ♪ ♪ I'm... You look incredible. Because of you. And this dress. It actually fits perfectly. How did you pick it out? Uh, buying women's clothes is one of my specialties. (laughs) Okay, that sounded just wrong. It's too much, Dash. It's not nearly enough. After all you've done for me, you deserve a perfect night. (chuckling) Okay, so Indian food, unless the Thai place is open. But check the sushi place first. You are very high maintenance. High maintenance, high reward. Oh, man, I got to make this quick. I don't know how much longer I'll be lucid, but this Eva person, I think she has you under some... I mean us... under some sort of spell. She's using you, man. She's trying to control you. But most important, you don't love her. You love Freya. FREYA: I can't believe she came here with him. Well, you did say they were friends. I don't trust him. (chuckles) Okay, that did sound a bit jealous. I am not jealous. Trust me. I want nothing more than to be as far away from Dash as possible. Well, he did help us save Ingrid. He can't be all that bad. (grumbles) You know, there's something about these paintings. Seem so familiar. I can't quite put my finger on it, you know what I mean? Uh-huh... It's like... I'm experiencing déjà vu. Okay, Freya, please tell me I'm not seeing what I'm seeing. FREYA: What? That looks like me. My face is in this artwork. Look... my lips, my eye... Is that your necklace? (Wendy gasps) Yes. How is this happening? What are you doing in these paintings? I don't know. Wendy. Ronan. (quiet laugh) I have dreamed about this moment so many times, I might ask you to pinch me. How 'bout I punch you, instead? (chuckles) Hi, I'm, uh... I'm Ronan, Wendy's husband. What? An extra olive, just the way you like it. Thanks, Mom. Mrs. Beauchamp... Oh, please. Joanna. So, Wendy tells me you're an environmental scientist. I'm so sorry that you saw my breasts. (laughs) Um, I didn't see anything. Really? I saw everything. But it's okay... (laughing): Guys, come on... It's all clear sailing from here. Thanks. Um... And I-I should tell you that... I-I really do like your son. Well, I'm glad. Maybe between you, me and your breasts, we can persuade him to stay in town for a while. (knocking on door) I'll be right back. I think I like your mom more than I like you. Aw, thanks. (both chuckle) It looks like we have one more for dinner. Hey, hey. Slow down. Where are you going? 
 
 I told you back in the '90s I never wanted to see you again. All right, well, can you talk to me for five minutes? I am your husband. Ex-husband! Ex! Semantics. Oh. How can you show up like this with all these paintings of me? Why would you do this to me? I did this for you, Wendy. This is all for you. Look, just... hear me out, please. Should I give you guys a minute? BOTH: Yes. No. I'm not gonna hear you out. The last time I heard you out, I ended up in Tijuana in a hotel room, in a wedding dress, while you escaped out the bathroom window from the cops. I came back. After I spelled the guards and broke you out of jail. I really need to hear the rest of that story. No, that story is over. I have married and divorced you three times. Never again. Babe, you say that every time. I mean it this time! Things are different now, okay? I've gotten my act together. Exactly... your "act." Now you're "Seamus," the gritty, reclusive artist. Would you... Shh. Or should I say "scam artist"? It's not a scam, okay? It's fun. I don't show my face and people pay millions of dollars for my work. Don't pull my cover. Look, Wendy, I've spent every day of the last 20 years thinking about you. Bullshit. You only think about yourself. Look around, would you? I did these paintings 'cause it was the only way to keep from going crazy. I just... I wanted to get you out of my head and onto the canvas. I wanted you here because I need you to know exactly how I feel about you. This is my love letter to you, Wendy. I want you back. I got to say, this is a total surprise, Tarkoff. It's been so long. Mmm. Feels like centuries. (laughs) So what are you doing here? I heard about Victor. I came as soon as I could. Well, it's really great to see you again. I'm sorry for your loss. Victor was one of a kind. Yeah, he was. We all miss him very much. (timer beeping) Well, that's my cue. Dinner's ready. I'm gonna go set another place. Can I help you serve? Sure. What are you doing here? Relax. I told you, I'm a friend. I'm just here to help, in case you need me. MAN: There's something strange going on in these canvases. It's something hypnotic. It's almost... seductive. Mmm. I-I'm not embarrassed to say I'll be leaving with one of them tonight. Would you excuse us? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Uh, carry on. And I'm not embarrassed to say I thought he'd never shut up. (laughs) My God. Do you want to dance? Come on. ♪ ♪ Oh, thank you Miss Beauchamp. I don't usually dance with my friends like this, Dash. Do you? Not exactly. But we're not just friends, are we? I mean, we've... been through hell together. You've saved my life, I've saved yours. We share more than a few secrets. So what is this about, then? The dress, the drinks, this night. I don't know. Do we have to put a label on it? I like labels. They're handy. They tell me where to put the books in the library. Without labels, I would be lost. Well, maybe we should get a little lost. See where we end up. (laughs) Just a thought. ♪ ♪ You know, I'd seen Victor just last spring. I've been in... living in Los Angeles, but whenever I was in Manhattan, I'd look him up. I was really sorry to hear that you two had split up. It's okay. We reconnected in the end. Tarkoff was actually the one who introduced Victor and I. Biggest mistake of my life. I've had a crush on Joanna for years, but then she met my best friend and I was finished. (laughs) You were like a brother to both of us. You helped us so much when we first came here. I've thought of you often throughout the years. Frederick, your mother needs some more wine. Oh, I can get it. Nonsense. Let someone wait on you. Frederick...? Joanna, I've been noticing the art on the walls. You're even better than I remembered. JOANNA: Well, I'm not good enough for my own gallery gala, but I'm not in it for the glory. You never were. CAROLINE: I always wished that I had some artistic talent. My brain is just so scientific. I... Art is like magic to me, it's just completely mysterious. It's easier to teach than you think. Thank you, honey. ♪ ♪ Mr. Hutton. It's, uh, it's so good to see you, sir. We have to talk about my son Kyle. I'm-I'm sorry, I'm afraid I haven't met him. You're lying, Dr. Gardiner. Excuse me? He's been missing for more than a month. One of his cars was found parked near Fair Haven on the night he disappeared. Okay... I think something terrible has happened to my son and I think you know more than you're admitting. Now, you should also know that I have hired the best private detectives that my money can buy. And if you're hiding something, I will figure it out. To old friends. And new beginnings. To old friends. Forgive me for being sentimental, but my world-travelling ex-pat son has been away for a long time, and... like any mother would, I missed him, terribly. But every time somebody proposed a toast, I would say a little prayer for my beautiful boy. Just hoping that wherever he was in his life, he's okay. And... I just want to say that tonight, I'm so grateful to be able to toast you in person. To you, babe. Mom... Mom, I'm so sorry. Mrs. Beauchamp, are you okay? It's okay. Yeah, let me help you with that. I'm sorry. Watch your hand. Watch your hand. What happened? I know what you're doing to me. We should start cleaning up. I said... I know what you're doing to me. I need you to calm down. I'm not gonna calm down. You have exactly ten seconds to tell me why the hell you spelled me into marrying... Aah! (screaming) Thank you, Dash. There you go. Of course. I was thinking we could find some paintings of some pears. (giggles) Is something wrong? No, I'm... I'm sorry. My head's just someplace else. I-I got a text from the hospital about a patient, and I... It's probably nothing, but I should at least call and check in. Would you excuse me? Oh, of course. I understand. Okay. Thank you. I'll be right back. You okay? No. You never told me about him. You were married three times? Yeah. The first two were pretty great. The last one, not so much. Honey... I've just been trying to forget. So he's a warlock. Mm. Yup. Oh, honey. I met him when your mom kicked me out of the family. I needed someone, he was there. (laughs) He's... incredibly charming... Mmm. And ridiculously fun. Mmm! And he has no ethics whatsoever. (laughs) You know, I actually watched him magic my last engagement ring right out of the display case. A four-carat, princess-cut, Tiffany diamond. I watched him steal it and I didn't even care. That's what he does to me. Ooh. RONAN: Hey. Um, uh, do you think we could... Yeah. Your necklace. Yeah. I've died a few times since I've seen you last. So... So what... this is your last life? Yup. You know, I might be able to help you out with that. How? By stealing a life from some poor schmuck? No, I'm not like that anymore, Wendy. Oh, I know too well what you're like. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, do you remember Paris? (laughs) How can I forget Paris? I got shot point-blank by someone you scammed. No... we scammed, okay? And that was one of the best days of my life. I got shot. I know, but I healed you, right? And it was exciting, and we... we made love under the stars. I thought I was gonna die of happiness. Oh, and... I kept this. It's my good luck charm. (both laugh gently) You are so sick. A little. But, hey, you have to admit, I mean... we may have had our ups and downs, but like you said, it has never... ever... been boring. I hate it when you do that. I know. Face it, Wendy... no one will ever... know you as well as I do. (groaning in pain) (groaning continues) (yells in pain) Shh... It's gonna be all right. That's it. Looks like...  we need to up your dose, papi. Mi amor, you're back. I missed you. I missed you more. Mr. Hutton. Well, I see I made you nervous. You know, the police are still treating this as a missing person case. My investigators are accessing Kyle's phone and text records, as we speak. If there's a connection to you, I'll know about it soon enough. There is no connection. I think there is. You know, my son and I... we never really saw eye to eye, but I owe him this. I won't stop until I find him. Mr. Hutton, I am sorry that your son is missing, I really am, but you're way off-base, if you think I'm responsible. You got nothing to worry about. Ad mortem, te. What are you doing? Ad mortem, te. (grunting) We were standing right here talking, and he just collapsed. I... I assumed it was a heart attack, so I called you guys immediately and started CPR, but... after a few minutes, it was... it was clear he was dead. Thanks, Dr. Gardiner. We appreciate your cooperation. Yeah, I just, uh... I wish I could have done more. But please, feel free to call me with any questions, okay? I'm always happy to help. RONAN: I-I've missed this so much. (Wendy laughs) No. Wait. No. Oh, I can't do this. Yes, yes, yes, you can. You are, and it's wonderful. Keep going. No. No. Ronan... Ronan, I mean it. I can't. (sighs) Oh, I was madly in love with you once. Three times. But it wasn't healthy for me. You're the reason I think love is pain. And I'm with someone else now, and, yeah, he may be an ordinary man, but he brings me joy, not pain. Yeah, but, babe, I-I told you I've changed. I hope you have. For your sake. But for me, it doesn't matter. I love him, and it doesn't even hurt. I can't be with you. I'm sorry. Hey, wait, Wendy... Wendy, please. Please, please, please, please... I need a lock of your hair. What? Preferably, more like a bunch. Like a big bunch. What are you talking about? Well, I wasn't lying when I said there was a part of you in every painting. See, every strand of hair holds a piece of someone's soul. I put a strand of your hair in every painting that I do. Your magic is inside them. That's why people love them! You kept my hair?! Well, yeah, in case I needed it some day. That is really creepy. No, no, no, no, Wendy. Wendy, this is the best spell I've ever done. These paintings sell for millions. I don't have to steal anymore. But I-I ran out of your hair about six months ago and I-I need more. (laughs) I don't actually know how to paint. (both laugh) (laughing) I don't ever want to see you again. I have one life left, and I don't want to waste another moment of it with you. So, is that a "no" on the hair? (metallic clanking, rattling) Oh, God. Tarkoff! God, you scared me. Didn't hear you come in. Let me give you a hand with those. Ah, don't worry. I'm nearly done. I'm really glad you came. So am I. It's brought back so many happy memories of Victor. You know, ever since he died... Oh. What? I don't know. I mean... I just... (crying): I miss him. (gently): Come here. Come here. It's hard to mourn alone. Yeah... It is... (laughs) You know, I was supposed to fly back to the coast tomorrow, but maybe I'll change my plans; stay in town a while. What do you think about that? I think that would be lovely. Yeah. Are you okay? No, not really. You know who that was? Uh-uh. It was William Hutton; Kyle Hutton's father. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, my God. I followed him out there to talk to him, you know, see what he knew, make sure no one suspects anything of us in relation to Kyle. And? No. No one suspects a thing, thank God. Look, he's worried about his son, but... as far as he's concerned, Kyle is just missing. He had no idea we even knew him. Poor guy. I mean, he must've been under so much stress, he just... he just collapsed. And I kept... I kept thinking, this is... this is my chance to save a life, you know, even the score, but... I don't know, what's the point of having all these powers if we can't use them to save people? Dash, I know how bad you feel, but it's not your fault. We've been telling each other that a lot lately. You know, I even considered bringing him back. And then I remembered what you said about not playing God, and the consequences, so I didn't. I'm sorry. No, don't be. You're the only one who's really been there for me. Explaining things to me, helping me. That's me.. Ingrid the Helper. Ever since I was a little kid, I was always the responsible one. The good one. Going to college and med school and being there for Mom. You were the anchor. Well... yeah... I guess I was. Sure you don't want me to walk you home? I'm fine. Are you okay, though? You just... you seem... No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm just, uh... I have a lot on my mind. Call me later? I will. Okay. (approaching footsteps) I'm very... disappointed, Frederick. Why didn't you go through with it? I thought we were on the same team. Harming my mother would only arouse suspicion. I won't do it. I was told by the king, if you don't cooperate, I should do whatever it takes. Is that a threat? What do you think? I'm not scared of you. You can't kill me. Until a host body is found, the king is right here. I'm the vessel, and you have no idea how to carry the king's spirit without me. You need me alive. Or I'll just cut the king's spirit right out of your chest. Except you can't. Afferrentur dolor. I can still hurt you, so we better figure out a way to work together. Remora. (coughing) I know a way we can do the work of the Mandragora ourselves. Just means getting our hands a little dirty. You better not be messing with me. I'm not. But if you touch so much as a hair on my mother's head, I'll slit my own throat. And we both know Grandfather can't continue his plan without me.
