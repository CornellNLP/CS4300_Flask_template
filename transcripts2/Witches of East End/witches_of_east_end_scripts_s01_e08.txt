 Previously, on Witches of East End... 
 Your necklace, it's red. This is your last life. 
 You should probably move along now. 
 INGRID: You didn't have to do that. I can take care of myself. 
 KILLIAN: You have nothing to worry about. 
 I just want to make sure I'm not getting in the middle of something. 
 It was just a kiss, and we are never, ever going to tell anyone because it's over. 
 DASH: I heard you at the library. I'm leaving early for London. 
 I'm not your mother. You knew me as Athena. 
 INGRID: Why am I here? 
 Serpens clavem. 
 It's a golden snake. The tail looks like a key. 
 I need you to convince your aunt to give it back. 
 INGRID: This will end if you tell me where the snake is. 
 WENDY: It's gone. 
 INGRID: She said one is your soul mate, and the other, your destroyer? 
 Does that mean one of them is gonna kill you? 
 It's a metaphor, Ingrid. Tarot cards are tricky that way. 
 And you think Killian is the destroyer? 
 Obviously. All this trouble started the night I met him. 
 He's the reason I lost Dash. Damn right he's the destroyer. 
 ...what, two minutes, and... 
 So, what are you gonna do? 
 What  can  I do? Dash is in London. He's not returning any of my calls. 
 He hates me right now... And rightfully so. 
 (speaking angrily) 
 (stops speaking abruptly) 
 Enjoy. 
 Freya, I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay. I am not gonna let Killian destroy me... 
 I'm gonna trade all this heartbreak for good. 
 Like for that angry couple back there. Watch. 
 ...something that's been going on... 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 Let's not do that again. 
 Okay. 
 What did you just do? 
 Gave 'em a "Rush of Love," with a twist. 
 Damn, you're good. 
 My life may be in shambles, but at least I can make someone else happy. 
 (long sigh) 
 PENELOPE:  Flore... 
 (soft whoosh)  Pulchre. 
 Flore... (soft whoosh) Veneficus. Mm... Season 1, Episode 8 "Snake Eyes" Wendy. Hey. Hey. What's up? I need to show you something, and, uh... (sighs) I don't want you to get angry with me. Okay, why would I be angry? (gasps) The portal key!? What the hell! You said that was destroyed. I lied. You lied...? I was killed over that key! I'm on my last life now. I am so sorry. You're  so  sorry! You promised me that you were not gonna get angry. No, I didn't. I heard you! No, I didn't! What are you doing, Joanna? What happened? And why did the shifter think that  I  stole it? I have no idea. I don't know. Jo... Archibald wanted it, for sure. Yeah? And he even suspected that we had it, but he's never figured out where it was, and I've kept it hidden for centuries. The shifter knows where we live, Joanna. Wendy, I messed up. Yeah, you messed up. You told me that thing was destroyed after we sealed the portal. I believed you. I know. And like I said... You lied. (sighs) Why would you keep that snake? It's... Seductive and corrupting and poisonous. You and I both know what it does to people. Why would you keep it this whole time? You thought that you might use it again someday. Unbelievable! And you call  me  the reckless one. You know that we can never go back there, Joanna. Why would you want to? Our lives so much better here. I've never used it, Wendy, I don't plan to use it, but I'm not getting rid of it... It is my only connection with our home. (exhales) ECHOING WHISPER: Wendy... I don't feel good about this. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Hey. Oh, no problem, no problem. So, what happened? Is Freya's wedding off? Maybe. Probably. Oh, I just wish there was something I could do to help. Well, if it makes you feel better, there's someone else here that you can help. Do they want to check out a book? Seems like he wants to check  you  out. INGRID: Oh, that's just Mike. That's the guy that saved you in the Civil War aisle? You didn't tell me how cute he was. You think so? BARB: Yeah. Barb, no, I'm-I'm not in the market. Oh, well, I'm not telling you to marry him. I'm not even telling you to date him. But I  am  telling you to go over there and help him. Mm-hmm. Hey, Mike. Ingrid, I am so glad to see you. What's going on? I hear you know a lot about the history of East End. I have studied some, yes. What do you want to know? Everything. My novel is historical fiction, set here at the turn of the 20th century, and I could really use some insight from an expert. (laughs): Well, I'm not sure I'm an expert, but I would be happy to help. Great. Hey. How's Dash's hand? I said hello. We're out of tequila. I think there's some more upstairs. So what, you're just... not gonna talk to me? I just did. I said we're out of tequila. (quiet laugh) How can you be mad at me? None of this is my fault. I didn't tell Dash what happened. Can you honestly look me in the eye and say you are not happy that he found out? This is what you wanted to have happen... Stop... Putting this on me. Look, I've done everything you asked. You wanted to be friends, we're friends. You told me to move on, I moved on. Stop treating me like I  screwed up  your  life. You did! You destroyed it! You think I want my brother to hate me? You think I want you  to hate me? I don't know what you want. I don't think  you  know what you want. I think this whole thing is a game to you, and I am not doing it anymore. Hi. (sighs) Amy... Sorry, I thought I would surprise you at work. Surprise. Maybe we shouldn't wait until sundown to bury it. Maybe we shouldn't bury it at all. I think we should just burn it. Would you feel more comfortable if I took care of this without you? No, I'd feel more comfortable if it didn't exist. You saw what it did to our father. It killed everything good inside of him. We're not getting rid of it, so you can stop looking at me like that. Listen, Joanna, I-I understand why you kept it. I do. You thought if you waited long enough, that maybe someday you could use it so you could see Frederick again. I don't want to talk about Frederick. You never want to talk about him. I know that you miss him. I don't want to talk about it. I should never have told you about the key. So just leave it alone, and I'll take care of it. (whispering)  Wendy... (screams) (screams) (gasping breaths) What did you do?! It attacked me. Get it off right now. Ow, ow, ow! I'm trying. I don't want to hurt you. What the hell happened! Did you look in its eyes? You know you are not supposed to look in its eyes. Okay, I am really,  really  not in the mood for one of your lectures right now. Dimitte serpens. This snake is a powerful vessel of pure evil. I think we need something a little stronger than off-the-cuff Latin commands! Let's try sarcasm; that should help. Let me get the Grimoire. (gasps) Joanna. Look. Stay right there. I'm getting the book. We'll figure this out. Hurry. (gasping breaths) (panting) (moaning exhale) ♪ Look, Killian... Oh, God. No good conversation ever started with "Look, Killian..." I really like you. I do. A lot. I have a thing for lost souls. I'm-I'm a sucker for them. But I don't think I'm the one who can find you. If this is because Freya, I told you... You did. You told me that you don't have feelings for her. And you can lie to me if you want, but you should stop lying to yourself. Good luck, Killian. Okay, what else have you got? Come on. Hit me. You finished those already? I am an unbelievably fast note-taker. It's-it's quite a skill. Wow. I don't know how many more history books on East End that we have. I'm actually looking for something more about... The occult. Witchcraft, curses, spirits, that kind of thing. Why? Well, I'm sure you're already aware of this, but this town has a long history of supernatural legends, from the early settlers to the witch burnings on to... Archibald Browning and his cult at Fair Haven. You know, East End is also famous for being one of the best pumpkin-growing towns on the Eastern Seaboard. Hmm. Hmm. BARB: Uh, Ingrid wrote her dissertation about witchcraft. Interesting. She didn't... mention it to me. It's not something I usually slip into conversation unless I want to bore someone. She also does witchcraft. Barb, stop. No, Barb, continue. INGRID: This is stupid. BARB: She got me pregnant. Okay. No, that sounds wrong. I meant she did a fertility spell for me that made it possible. INGRID: It was a fake spell I got off the Internet probably written by an 11-year-old boy. It had nothing to do with you getting pregnant. There's no such thing as witchcraft. BARB: Well, tell that to this thing inside me that makes me throw up every morning. (chuckles) She's funny. Sounds like we have a lot more to talk about. Uh, actually, no. I got a lot of work to do right now. Well, I'm not going anywhere. Okay. So, we can talk later. Yes. All right. (exhales) Didn't I just see Amy? Where is she? She left. Just broke up with her. What? Why? Well, I felt like she was interested in something serious and... I'm not. What are you doing, Killian? What do you mean? I mean, here. With your life. Why are you even still here? Why be here at all if you're just hurting people? I don't think you're in a position to judge me, Freya. Is there a Freya Beauchamp here? Yeah, just over there. These are for you. Oh. I just need you to sign. Thanks. Oh, my... (gasps) (exhales) Oh, my God. They're from Dash. You sure about that? No name on the card. Of course they're from Dash. Who else would they be from? (exhales) Oh, my God. (sniffs) Ow. Got it. Wendy, don't worry. I have an idea. Wendy...? Killian. Hey, Mom. Oh... Are you ready to go? Yeah, sure. Freya. I'm going out on my break. Be back in an hour. Penelope, it's so nice to see you. Dear, are you all right? You look terrible. What? KILLIAN: Seriously, what's wrong? What do you mean? Well, for one thing, you keep... swaying. Oh, I do? You look positively green. Come with me. I'm taking you home. Oh, I... My shift isn't over. I insist. I'm sure Killian can cover for you. We'll have to take a rain check on our lunch. Yeah, of course. No problem. But I can't leave work. You can't stay here if you're getting sick. Now come on, dear. I promise to take very good care of you. FREYA: Okay. Hey. You okay? Yeah. I found a spell that may work. I have what we need but I'll need to... prepare. I think we can save the key if we get it right. I don't think that'll be necessary. Wendy... This key is the answer to our problems. We can use it to go back home. Wendy, stop. The venom's getting to you. We just talked about it. We can't go back. Maybe it's safe by now. Look at me. It'll never be safe. That's why I haven't used the serpent. Maybe you're wrong. You know we didn't leave by choice. Our father banished us to this world when he came into power. But... No! He said if we ever returned to Asgard, he will kill us. But maybe he's changed. He hasn't changed. You don't know that. I have one life left, Joanna, and I don't want to spend it here. I want to go home. You're immortal. You don't understand. Wendy, please listen, I need you to focus. If I could just get to the portal... No! Absolutely not. If that portal opens, we have no idea what may come through from the other side! (gasps) The snake is seducing you to get what it wants. It only wants to open the portal. That's all  I  want. I miss my home. It was better there. I miss it, too, Wendy, but it's not the same place anymore. Claude ianuas! No! (grunts) Joanna...! Joanna! Aperite! (screams) (sighs) You are such a bitch. Grow up, Joanna. You can't keep me in here forever. I will break this spell eventually. You know I will. This has nothing to do with you. (shouts, grunts) (gasps, screams) (grunts) I'm trying to help you. You can help me by letting me go! (grunting) (shouts) (gasps) We have got to get this thing off of you. Are you kidding me?! (panting) You don't care about me. You didn't speak to me for over a hundred years. I guess you're a coldhearted bitch. (panting) Just ask Frederick. Oh, that's right. You can't. Because you left him behind. You abandoned your only son. That is not true. It's not? You didn't abandon him? (clatter) He refused to come with us. You know that he was turned against me. You know, for somebody... supposedly so nurturing, all you seem to do is destroy people. That's why you can't talk about Frederick. Because you can't deal with what you did to him. Or maybe you... just don't care. It broke my heart, Wendy. There's not a day that goes by that I don't regret leaving him there. What do you think the girls are gonna say when I tell them that you left their brother behind? Stop it. Oh, that's right. It doesn't really matter, does it? Because they're gonna die soon anyway. It always happens around this time. Right, Joanna? (chuckles) Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock. That's enough. Did I strike a nerve? Liber a vinculis. (bird chirping) (Freya groans) I feel worse. What's wrong with me? Drink this tea. It'll help. I can't feel my arms. Oh, well, let me help. (moans) 
 
 Dash sent me flowers today. Oh, that's wonderful, dear. That must mean he forgives you. He's my soul mate. Of course he is. Have some more. I just feel so sleepy. I'm gonna lay down. Oh, that's good. You sleep. Mm-hmm. (chuckles) Vinum attenuat... ...Eam. INGRID: Hey. I'm leaving soon. I promise. It's just... it's so much nicer here than my hotel room. Take your time. I found one more that might be useful. Great. (exhales) (laughs) I did not tell you about my dissertation, but you didn't tell me you're a published author. I can't believe there's a library that actually stocks this. It wasn't exactly a bestseller. Well, we have it, and I would like for you to sign it for me. Isn't there some kind of rule about writing in library books? (laughs): I won't tell, if you don't. Thank you. So, what's it about? I don't want to spoil it for you, so you'll just have to read it yourself. Deal. ♪ Thank you, Ingrid, for all of your help. This would be taking so much longer without you. Even for Super Speed Reader Guy? Yes, even for him. (laughs) So, you have my book. When do I get to read your dissertation? Oh, no. That is not happening. I-I never even finished it. Why not? I-I realized that an academic study of witchcraft was kind of ridiculous. Ah, so you don't believe in the supernatural. No. Mm-mm. I'm a rational skeptic, all the way. In that case, you probably shouldn't read the book I'm working on. If I ever finish it. Why not? I like science fiction and fantasy. It's not fantasy. Really? It is about witches, but... I believe witches are real. (loud click) Funny. Where are you, Wendy? You are not going into that portal. ♪ (Wendy yells) (grunting) (grunting) No! (Wendy grunts) So, what, are you gonna kill me? Is that the plan? If I have to... Unless you kill me first. You forget, I'm immortal. (laughs) But now I know what'll kill you. This is giving me all kinds of good ideas. That thing's infecting you. You can't believe what it's telling you. No, it's opened my eyes. I now see that you're the evil one, Joanna. No wonder your husband left you. The only man that you ever really truly loved. And you destroyed him as well! Leave him out of this, Wendy. (laughs) The girls don't know about that one, either, do they? What have you told them about their father? Don't they have a right to know that he's alive and so close by? He left a long time ago. He knows where we are. He chooses to stay away. I wonder why he chooses to stay away. Is it because he can't stand the sight of you? Because that one, I can understand. Or is it that he can't forgive you for leaving Frederick behind. Or is it losing the girls... Over and over and over again, because it's your fault that they're cursed? Stop! (screams) MIKE: I understand how it sounds... I used to be a skeptic, too... but I've seen evidence... I've seen convincing evidence... Evidence can be faked. There are real witches, Ingrid, living among us, hiding right in plain sight. I believe they came here a very long time ago from a different world. Asgard. Asgard? This place is a myth. I think it's real, and I think it's actually connected to this very town. So you believe there's this other world of magical people who can find their way here. Well, when you say it in that tone of voice, of course it sounds crazy. (laughing): I'm sorry, it's just, it's hard to wrap your head around it. Look, I'm not saying it's definitely real. I just... Hope it is. My father spent his entire adult life looking for it. Was he a writer, too? No. An archaeologist. He was... obsessed with proving that this mythical world was a real place. Of course, people thought he was insane. And eventually it came true... He did lose his mind. I'm so sorry. No. It's okay. He died a couple years ago, but before he went, he shared his work with me, and... the scary thing is, it all makes sense. I have to prove my father wasn't crazy. (sighs) I've been going through his work, putting together the pieces, connecting the dots, and what I think I've discovered is: the door to Asgard is here, in East End. PENELOPE:  Potionem... hanc... tollam... viribus... tuis. Dona mihi... ...ero. You're starting to really piss me off, Wendy. This ends right now! (panting): Oh, it will... But not the way you hope. You had this key the whole time! We didn't have to be stuck here, where we're persecuted, where we have to hide our true nature. Why don't you want to go back?! Because we're safer here than there. Not for long. Axicia volant! Ooh, nice reflexes, babe. You keep that thing on much longer, you'll never be yourself again. It's been pumping poison into your veins this whole time. Then you'll have to destroy it to get it off me, and I know that you can't because of Frederick. So I guess you're in a bit of a pickle, aren't you? Wendy... come on. Omnia telavolant! (laughs) (sighs) Axicia... interficiam serpens. My father found this on a dig in Peru. He believed that this... was a map to Asgard. As you can see, though, it's very faded. That is an interesting symbol. What did he think that meant? Uh, he didn't know. He thought it had something to do with witchcraft, but... he couldn't crack it. I haven't figured it out, either, but... that's not gonna stop me from trying. (whooshing) (whooshing) DASH (calls): Hello? Anybody home? Mom, are you here? What's going on? Hurry! Get your medical bag! INGRID: Well, it sure seems like you have a lot of material for this book of yours. I know. I should probably get going. There's just one more book I need to look at. I'll be right back. (inhales) (whispers):  Ostende te. Whoa. (footsteps approaching) (whispers):  Absconde Te. See anything interesting on there? No. It, uh... I think you're right, it's just too worn out. Yeah. PENELOPE (hoarsely): What's wrong with her? I can barely feel the pulse. What the hell happened here? I-I don't know. We were having tea, and she just suddenly collapsed. How long ago? I don't know, just... one or two minutes before you got here. Should I call 911? She's in anaphylaxis. Her blood pressure's dropping. Her breathing's labored. I can practically hear her throat closing up. What are you going to do? She needs a shot of epinephrine, now. (gasps) WENDY:  Aperio! Aperio! Wendy? Aperio! You'll never get out. Watch me. (gasps) (cries out) So, now you're trapped, too. Let me go. Let me go, and I will. No. I can't do that. Well, your blood pressure's normal, so that's good. Oh, thank God. What did you eat today? I mean, what do you think could've caused this? I don't know. It's just... it's all so foggy. I'm just glad you got here when you did. Yeah, we should probably get you to the hospital, though, just to be safe. No, no, no, no. I'm okay. Really. You let me know if you need anything, all right? (sighs) So, how did you get back from London so fast? I didn't go to the conference. I flew to London, I got off the plane and... I just couldn't do it. Couldn't do what? I couldn't sit through all those seminars knowing things weren't settled with us. I couldn't have this... an ocean between us knowing things weren't okay. So I turned around and I came right back. I came back to tell you that I can't marry you. Not after what you did. Oh. Okay. And then I saw you... About to die... And I realized that I don't want to live in a world where you don't exist. The thought is unbearable. It's unbearable to me, too. I thought I lost you and it was like my life was destroyed. I will never hurt you again. I promise. Just promise you'll never scare me like that again either. (laughs, sniffles) I promise. I love you, Freya. Always. I love you, too. Thank you for keeping this place open so late for me. No problem. This is what counts as rebellious for me. (chuckles) Hey, I hope I didn't freak you out with all that talk of mythical cities, and magical portals and witches. I swear I'm not as crazy as I seem at first. No, I don't think you're crazy. I just think we have different interests. I left all that witch stuff behind a long time ago, so, I don't know how much more help I can be to you. Okay. Ingrid, you're not angry about something, are you? 'Cause I'm sorry if I said something... No, not at all. I think I'm just tired. Long night. I get it, and I owe you one. If you decide to finish your dissertation, I'd be more than happy to help. Good night. Night. (door opens, closes) (insects chirring, owl hooting) You know, all you have to do is open the door, and this will all be over. Just let me go on my way. You never have to see me again. I won't do it. Okay. Then I'll strangle you (speaks indistinctly) until you pass out and I'll take you through the portal and I'll offer you as a sacrifice. (panting) You'll die, I'll live. Oh, this key is giving me so much more strength. I like it. This shouldn't take much time. (weakly):  Ianua. No...! (whimpering): Joanna! Dissolvere. (screams) (whimpers) (fork clatters) (Wendy whimpering) (sniffles, pants) (cries quietly) You're okay. This should stop the bleeding. (inhales sharply) And I'll... I'll heal you later. I just... I'm just going to take a minute. FREYA: Will you stop it. I'm fine. Let me do my job. Please. All right. I want to get you to the hospital tomorrow, run some blood tests. Yes, Doctor. I'm not kidding. I know. Look, what happened tonight was serious. You know, I almost lost you. Do you believe in fate? Not really. Well, I do. I believe certain things are written in the stars. Like us. We're meant to be. I can't wait to call you my wife. But you need to get some rest. I'm gonna take a shower. Hey, I'm gonna start a fire, okay? Use the matches next to the fireplace. Luce, igni! Uh... matches come toward me. Um... Veniat ad me arca archa. What is...? Wh...? I'm so sorry for everything I said. It wasn't your fault... it was the snake. Yeah, but because of me, you destroyed your only chance to ever see your son again. It was either that or let you be a monster forever. I understand if you hate me. It wasn't your fault. You were right, I should have destroyed the key a long time ago. I was just... I was just holding onto the hope that I might see my son again someday. But it wasn't real. It was... It was just a hope and... I mean, I hate to admit it... ...He really is gone. He's gone. I think about him all the time. I miss him so much. (sniffles) So do I. I'm sorry. Hey. What the hell happened in here? It's nothing. Long story. What about you? How was your day? Strange. Is there a real place called Asgard? (low): I'm gonna throw up. Oh, my God, it's true. And that's where we came from? Who told you...? How did you...? This guy at the library, a writer. He's not one of us, but he's tryin' to find the door... To Asgard. He's convinced it's in East End. Great. Well, that door is locked. Forever. No one's going in or out. There've always been mortals trying to prove the myths are real. Don't even humor him. I'd just stay away from him as much as possible, if I were you. Yeah, I will. (door opens) (door closes) Hey. Hey, sweetheart... Hey... Hey. So... Dash is back and everything seems to be okay. Good... That's great! My powers are gone. What...? Thank you, Freya... (laughs)
