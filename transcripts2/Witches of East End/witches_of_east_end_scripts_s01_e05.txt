 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 Your brother got a job at the bar today. 
 What? 
 I was engaged once before. 
 Killian slept with her three months before our wedding, and that was pretty much the last time I saw my brother. 
 Joanna Beauchamp? How could you sit here as if everything is normal? 
 I watched you kill my husband. 
 Shut up. 
 Freya: What just happened to her? 
 Revive papilio. 
 (Gasps) 
 Joanna: Who's the shifter? 
 Wendy: Trying to find out who's gonna die because of the curse that you unleashed. 
 (Crying) 
 Adam! 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 It's Adam's funeral today. 
 I know. 
 And I thought maybe I could go with you? 
 I know how much he meant to you and how you... 
 Are probably blaming yourself. 
 It's fine. 
 I'm okay. I'm actually not going to the funeral. 
 What do you mean? Why not? 
 I did love Adam, obviously, or he wouldn't have died. 
 Ingrid... It's not your fault. 
 But we weren't dating that long, and I don't want to play the grieving widow. 
 His funeral should be a family thing. 
 I wouldn't feel right. 
 Okay. 
 Then maybe you and I can do something to remember him; a little ritual to say good-bye. 
 It's okay, Wendy. I just want to be alone right now. 
 Honey, there's no shame in leaning on people who love you. 
 Just let me do this my own way. 
 Please, Wendy? 
 (Sighs) 
 (Door shuts) 
 Mm, hey. 
 Hey. 
 Season 1, Episode 05 
 "Electric Avenue" 
 It really is breathtaking, don't you think? 
 It's beautiful. I can't believe they found this. 
 What's going on? 
 Oh... go away. 
 It's bad luck to see the dress before the wedding day. 
 You got a dress? 
 Well, some workmen found the most beautiful antique wedding gown yesterday, when they were working on the east wing. 
 I can't believe I'm actually gonna live in a house with wings. 
 And the dress is perfect. It's so much better than that tacky thing that Elyse was gonna wear at Dash's first wedding. 
 Anyway, got lots to do. See you later, dears. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's fine. We're actually making progress, believe it or not, but, still, she never misses a chance to remind me that you've been engaged before. 
 Well, maybe it's just because she's so happy you're the one I'm with now. 
 I think she'd be happier if a barmaid wasn't moving into her house. 
 (Chuckles) But that's just too damn bad, because I'm not going anywhere. 
 Mmm. You better not. 
 Mm-mm. 
 Now get out of here. 
 All right. (Chuckles) 
 (Birds chirping) 
 Harrison: Jo. 
 Hey, Jo. 
 Hey. 
 Wow, that's beautiful. 
 We gotta be in court in ten minutes. Let's go. 
 It's just so surreal. 
 I'm charged with a murder I didn't commit and committed a murder that no one knows about. 
 You did what you had to do. You owned your power. 
 You stood up for your family. You were the best version of yourself. 
 Seeing that just made me love you more. 
 How much of what you say to me is bullshit? 
 And how much is actually sincere? 
 Why would I bullshit you? Seriously? It hasn't worked for 200 years. 
 I wouldn't bother anymore if it wasn't the truth. 
 Thank you, Harrison. 
 All right, let's go do this. 
 (Grunts) 
 Okay... 
 Freya: Hey, Ingrid. It's me. Again. I'm just checking on you. 
 I know you said you want to be alone, but I just want you to know that I'm thinking of you. 
 Call me if you need me. I love you. 
 (Ratcheting) I can feel you undressing me with your eyes. 
 No, I was dressing you even more with protective gloves, you know? 
 (Jukebox begins playing song) 
 Safety first? 
 I like that you care about my safety. 
 No more so than the safety of any other coworker. 
 Killian: But you're here on your day off, which must mean you missed me. 
 Or else it's payday. Where's Roger? 
 Not in yet. 
 All right, I'll wait. 
 Can I get you a drink? 
 No. Thank you. 
 Actually, um... 
 You and the bartender, are you guys...? 
 Oh, no, no, no. I'm engaged to his brother. 
 Wow. I guess... Dash's tastes have changed. (Wry laugh) 
 I'm sorry. Who are you exactly? 
 I'm Elyse. I was engaged to Dash, too. 
 Adam: I'm just kidding. 
 (Ingrid laughing) 
 Oh, man... you know, I feel like I haven't eaten in days. 
 I should be starving, but I-I'm not really hungry at all. 
 What-what time is it, anyway? 
 Uh, like, noon, I guess? 
 I can't find my phone. 
 Are you going somewhere? 
 (Sighs) Sadly, yeah. 
 I need to get back to work, you know? 
 I took the last three days off. 
 So take one more. 
 That's what I'm doing. 
 (Sighs) 
 Mmm... 
 Weird how that keeps happening. 
 I guess we're an electric combination. 
 No doubt about that. 
 Harrison: Mrs. Thatcher, could you walk us through the night of your husband's death as you remember it? 
 Well, we were in the park, taking the dog for a walk. 
 And it was dark. 
 And... 
 I don't actually remember what happened. 
 Mrs. Thatcher, you gave a detailed account to the police. 
 So, uh, could you try to recall... 
 Your Honor, I appreciate the prosecutor's assistance, but if I thought he was qualified to be a member of the defense team, I would've hired him by now. 
 This is the defense's cross. Don't interrupt again. 
 Thank you, your Honor. 
 For the record, Mrs. Thatcher, can you, with complete certainty, identify your husband's killer? 
 Well, I'm not sure. 
 It was so dark. And foggy. 
 Harrison: Mm-hmm. 
 And I heard a lot of screaming... 
 ...But I didn't actually see who killed my husband. 
 (Screams) 
 (Gasping) 
 Ingrid: Adam, you can stay here. 
 I promise no one's expecting you to show up for work today. 
 I-I'm pretty sure they are. 
 Listen, these last few days have... 
 Been kind of the best of my life. 
 But I do have to get back to my life. 
 Oh, God. O-okay, Adam... 
 Please try to hear this with an open mind. 
 No one is expecting you at work today, because they're at your funeral. 
 (Laughs) 
 You have a very strange sense of humor. 
 Think back to a couple of days ago... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 At the hospital. 
 You collapsed. 
 You had an aneurysm. 
 And you died. 
 B-but I'm-I'm here. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I can't be dead. I... um... 
 That's-that's im... Im... 
 You are here, yes, but you're more like a conscious apparition than a... 
 Flesh and blood person. 
 Really? 'Cause that looks like a lot of blood, Ingrid. 
 It's okay, it's okay. I know what you're seeing. 
 This is a totally normal part of the process. 
 What process? What are you talking about? 
 Where you process your new reality. I've read all about this. I can fix it. 
 Restituo perspicientia. 
 Restituo perspicientia. 
 Restituo perspicientia. There. What the hell are you? Adam... Get away from me. (Door shuts) Dash, hey, it's me... I know you're busy at the hospital and this is, like, my ninth call, but please call me back. I really need to talk to you. Hey, what do you think? (Gasps) What? Where did you get that dress? (Screams) Ingrid! Some workmen found it at Fair Haven. (Yelps) Oh, my Go... (Gasps) Why would you do that? I liked this dress. It was your sister's. Ingrid's?! She was getting married a long time ago. I don't want to talk about it. Oh, my God. You have to give me more than that. That dress has bad karma. Oh, this... This family is crazy. Okay, what is wrong with you? Your aura is all over the place. 'Cause I'm freaking out. Dash's old fiancée is in town. Okay. And you're worried about her and Dash? No, of course not. Okay, fine. Maybe. But sometimes I just wonder, if she hadn't cheated on him with Killian, maybe they would still be together. Yeah? Well, I've read that boy, and if there's one thing I'm sure of, he is madly in love with you. I know. I just... You want to hear it from him. Yeah. I get it. So, go talk to him, and tell that bitch to back off, 'cause I have claws, and I ain't afraid to use 'em. We're gonna talk about that wedding dress. Uh-huh. All rise! This Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Pilgrim presides. Judge: I have determined that, in the light of today's events, I am disallowing Maura Thatcher as a witness for the prosecution. And given the State has no other witnesses, no motive, and no physical evidence to implicate Joanna Beauchamp in the murder of William Thatcher, I hereby grant the defense's motion for dismissal. Enjoy the rest of your day. Does that mean...? That your lawyer's a total stud? It does indeed. You're free. Uh... Oh, I cannot thank you enough. You are... "Are the best?" Yeah, I know. Doesn't it seem a little bit off, though? I mean, it's awfully convenient that she just forgets that she saw me murder her husband. It... You're a free woman, Joanna. Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth, and let's not talk about this here, okay? So, what do you say we have some champagne? ♪ I can't believe it. My life is... is over. It doesn't have to be over. You said these last few days with me have been the best you've ever had. They've been the best I've ever had, too. But... but I'm dead. Everyone has problems. (Both laugh) How did this happen, anyway? I mean, how-how am I even here? I conjured your spirit. But how? I used a spell. I'm a witch. Come on, Ingrid. I... You're a ghost. I don't really think you're in a position to judge. True. (Rifles fire in salute) Um, it's just... strange. I mean, you... (Rifles fire) Yeah, I know. I only just found out. It's been a somewhat bumpy transition. I can relate. (Commander shouts orders to officers) I tried to talk to them, but no one seems to see me or hear me. Except you. I can see things normal people can't. The thing is, you are pure energy now. That's why sometimes when you touch me, we get a shock. I don't mind the shock. Two more? You guys, give me a sec. Hey, we need to talk. I want to know what you're doing here. Why? Are you worried about something? No, I'm not. Well, maybe you should be. Hey, I'm not done talking to you. Freya? You okay? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? Oh, you tell me. You're the one out here shouting at no one. I'm not shouting at no one. I'm not shouting at all. I was talking to Elyse. Who? Elyse... Dash's old fiancée, the one you slept with? She just left. Freya, I think someone was messing with you. Elyse is dead. ♪ Cheers. Cheers, cheers. Mmm! Well, I, for one, am relieved this is finally over, Joanna. Look me in the eye and swear that you did not cast another spell on that poor woman. What are you talking about? Joanna... Because... No, we both know how dangerous memory spells are... Dangerous and irreversible. Okay, she went through something traumatic. And she clearly got confused... it happens. I didn't do anything, Jo... you know what? Congratulations. It's been really great celebrating with the two of you. Do you believe her? Not for a second. But that's what we do for people we love. I'd do anything for you. Anything? Hey, are ghosts real? Yeah, of course. Don't say, "of course." There's no "of course." What do you think happens when we die? We become spirits, and we cross over into the spirit world. Okay, so, there's witches, there's ghosts. Are there vampires? Oh, please don't be ridiculous. Why this sudden interest in ghosts? They're very rare. There's not much for them in this world. They would much rather be where they belong. Well, apparently, Dash's ex-fiancée didn't get the memo. She's dead?! Yeah. Killian told me. She killed herself five years ago. It was the night Dash broke up with her. She took a bunch of pills, and he was the one who found her. Oh, God, that's awful. I know, and he never told me about it. Just like he never told me he had a brother. Just like he never told me he was ever engaged in the first place. He keeps a lot of secrets, Wendy. Yeah, well, cut him some slack. We all have our secrets. So what do I do about Elyse? I don't exactly enjoy being haunted by my fiancé's ex-fiancée. Well, unfortunately, you can't force a ghost to leave. They have to choose to go on their own. So she can just, like, hang around indefinitely? Forever? Yeah. Have you seen any sign of her before this? No. Well, then what I'm wondering is, how she got here in the first place. Ghosts can't cross back on their own. They need someone to open the door for them. Oh, my God! (Gasps) No, she didn't! Who? Who didn't? Who didn't? (Sighs) Wait. Wait. Who...? She didn't? What? (Door opening) (Wendy gasps) Wendy: I knew it! (Adam clears his throat) Um, they can't see me, right? Oh. Yeah, we can. No wonder you're not in mourning! You're too busy up here getting laid. Um, Adam, can you excuse us for just a minute? Yes. Adam. Mm-hmm. Hi. Hi. I didn't resurrect him. I would not make that mistake again. All I did was summon his spirit. Yeah. And you allowed another spirit to piggyback on the spell. Now, Dash's dead fiancée is here messing with Freya! What?! Yeah. But I did my research. That was not in the book. I didn't know something like this could happen. What you don't realize about witchcraft could fill a library, Ingrid. That's why I asked you to let your mother and me guide you, so something like this didn't happen again. I know you feel terrible about the curse. What curse? But this is not the way to deal with your guilt. This is not about guilt! I love him! I just wanted to be with him. You can't be with him. He doesn't belong here. And if he doesn't leave soon, he's gonna be stuck here forever. Tonight is a full moon. If he doesn't leave by sunrise, then he can never move on. But you knew that, didn't you, Ingrid? That was definitely in the book. I can think of worst fates than spending my life with someone I love. Honey... you're gonna change and grow and keep moving forward. He's gonna be trapped in a world where most of the people he knows and loves can't even see him. Don't do that to him. And don't limit your life to being stuck in this room, hiding from the world. That's been most of my life anyway, but at least now, I'm not alone. Please get out. Ingrid... Go! (Sniffles) (Sighs heavily) (Laughs) Good things really do come to those who wait. Mmm. Oh, you're the most extraordinary woman, you know that? (Laughs) Mmm. (Contended sigh) Uh, whoops. (Sighs) You're not so bad yourself. Huh. Thank you. 
 
 Why are you dressed? No, no, no, no. We should be ordering Chinese food right now, and I can feed you dumplings... naked. I wish I could. I feel like I should really be here for Ingrid tonight. She's going through a hard time. And... I just assume that now that you're done with my case, that you probably have other clients you need to deal with? Right? Yeah. Should be getting back to the city, right? (Sighs, groans) I have some errands that, um, I need to run. That was really great. I wish you could hear me. I'm sorry for what I did. I never meant to hurt you. And it wasn't your fault, what happened. I know you found me. I know you tried to save me. Goddamn it. (Electrical buzzing) Dash (Quietly): Oh, come on. (Buzzing) (Sighs) (Knocking on door) Hey. Oh, look! The bartender's feeling threatened. Well, isn't this a pleasant surprise. Actually, I don't know how pleasant this is gonna be. Why? What are you doing? What's up? I know about Elyse. I know about what happened to her. I know that when you left her, she went crazy and took a bunch of pills. I didn't go crazy. Killian told you. Elyse: Why don't you stay out of this. Elyse: This has nothing to do with you. I am so sorry. I-I didn't mean to keep this a secret from you. I just... I-I hate talking about her. Okay, that part of my life, I just want to put it behind me, put Elyse to rest. Why didn't you tell me about this? It's normal to feel guilt and regret in these situations. And I do feel guilt about what happened, but I don't regret leaving her. And that just makes me feel even more guilty. Even before Killian slept with her, deep down I knew I didn't really love her. I was... I was more... Hurt by what he did to me than her betrayal. Hey. I love  you. Our worst day together is better than my best day with Elyse, because this is real. And I want you by my side. Forever. (Elyse scoffs) You can have him. He's not the one I came for. (Woman groaning loudly) (Grunting) Maura! (Grunting) Maura! Maura, stop! (Screaming) (Owl hooting) (Phone vibrating) Hello? Is it possible for a ghost to hurt someone? Like, physically, if they wanted to? I... guess so. Yeah, I mean, I've only seen ghosts affect electricity, you know, like turning lights on and off, or... Making TVs go fuzzy, but I guess they could harness electricity to hurt someone if they wanted to. Why? Do you think that Elyse is gonna try to hurt you? It's not me I'm worried about. Freya? Freya? She totally lost it, Wendy. She's in lockdown in the mental ward at East End General. I watched them take her away. Who? The woman whose brain you melted with your spell... Maura Thatcher. Please don't deny it again. (Wry laugh) I saw a problem and I fixed it. You ruined her life. Her life was already ruined. Her husband was murdered in cold blood right in front of her face, and you were about to go to jail for the crime. We have an obligation, Wendy, not to abuse our power. Oh, please, get off your high horse. Someone who's killed a man with a fireplace poker four days ago? Oh, that was completely different. Oh, of course that was completely different, because everything you do is righteous and justified. And everything I do is wrong... even when I'm trying to help. You know what, next time try saying, "Thank you, Wendy, thank you for doing what needed to be done." But I won't hold my breath! ♪ Hey. Hey. Wh-what's up, Freya? Have you noticed any weird electrical problems happening in the bar tonight? Blew a couple of fuses this morning, and the jukebox had some problems. Anything else... weird? Well, you're being a little weird, now that you mention it. (Sighs anxiously) Isn't this your night off? Yeah. Sorry, I just, uh, I knew it was your first night working solo. Thought you might need a little help closing. Yeah. Should be a real bear. There's something... I have to tell you, and I understand if... You hate me when I do. It's kind of my fault you died. What-what are you talking about? I... I did a spell I shouldn't have done, and there was a price. The price was someone I loved had to die. I didn't know it would be you. And I couldn't stop it. I'm so sorry. I know that changes how you... Feel about me. Ingrid. I forgive you. It was an accident. Oh, God, it gets worse. There's something else you need to know. That my window to the other side is... closing. How did... Death brings an intrinsic wisdom that's... hard to explain. Plus, you guys were really loud when you were talking about it earlier. I want you to be where you belong. I don't know where I belong. If I go, I... don't know where I'm going to. And if I stay, then I don't know what that means for us. I don't want you to feel obligated to build your life around a ghost. What if you got sick of me? (Laughs) No. I don't think that's possible. Am I a terrible person for wanting to be with the man I love? Oh, no, no, no, no. No more than I am for... Wanting to stay. Oh... ♪ Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but go home. I've seriously got this covered. What? I'm just trying to help you. What's the big deal? First you love me, then you hate me, now you love me again? Well... I can't keep up. I never loved you. I never hated you, I'm just trying to help out a brother. In-law. You are extremely weird, you know that, right? Weird. (Sighs) (Electrical pop, sizzling; Freya screams) Uh, Elyse... I know you are here. You're upset, I get it; I would be, too. But you shouldn't punish Killian for your mistake. This isn't his fault. (Electrical buzz) Elyse? Can you hear me? (Electrical crackling) ♪ (Electrical crackling) (Zaps, pops) (Gasps) Oh... There's nothing left for you here anymore, Elyse. It's time for you to let go. I don't have to let go of anything. You do if you ever want to get out of here, you have until the sun comes up. I am not leaving until I get what I came for. Hurting Killian is not gonna heal your pain, Elyse. I don't want to hurt him, I want to be with him. He finally slept with me, and then he didn't want to be with me anymore. But I still love him. I have always loved him. So I'm gonna take him with me. Freya: No! Elyse, stop! (Electrical humming, lightbulbs popping) (Crying) Killian: Freya, what is going on? Who are you talking to...? Freya: Killian, don't touch the light! (Killian grunts, Freya screams) (Panting) Killian, can you hear me? Killian... Oh, God, are you okay? Patient unconscious and not breathing when we arrived. No pulse. Crash cart! Clear. (Flatline tone) Going again. Give him an epi. Clear. Dash: Going again. Give him an epi. Clear. (Rapid beeping) (Slow, steady beeping) (Sighs) (Relieved sigh) (Groans quietly) Were you waiting up just to kick me out of your life again? Firstly, you were right. How can I be on my high horse when I killed a man four days ago? It was self-defense. Like what I did to Maura. (Sighs): At least that's what I've been trying to tell myself. Can I just say something? Let me finish... I know that I can be impulsive and it's a problem, but... I felt like it was either her or you, and in that situation, I will always pick you. I slept with Harrison. What?! Wait a minute, wait a minute. Slow down. Okay... Details... how was it? (Stammers) What? It was great, actually. It was? It was great, it was better than I had ever imagined, and then I ran out of there like my hair was on fire. Was it? What? It's not like it would be the first time. He looked... He looked so happy. Aw... And I just felt the walls closing in on me. I don't know why, I just ran out of there. I know why. You've been alone for so long, you don't know how to open up and be vulnerable, but that was a really good first step. Whoo! I just don't think that Harrison would agree. Oh, please, he'll be all right, he's a big boy. That's really true. (Wendy gasps, Joanna laughs) Joanna, you little minx. Oh, God, I do feel bad about Maura. I had no idea that she would have such a severe reaction. That is exactly why those spells are so dangerous. Okay, I know, all right? I know, I know. Will you just... will you help me make it right? Wendy, we can't make it right. But I can help you make it a little better. Hey. (Sighs) What happened? The electrical system at the bar went haywire, and you got a shock. The last thing I remember was you saying you loved me, then I took out the trash. I actually didn't say that, you did. Oh, right. I'm just glad you're okay. That was really scary. And because I'm such an awesome sister-in-law, I'm gonna get you whatever you want from the vending machine, as long as it's pretzels, because they're out of everything else. You're not my sister-in-law yet. Hey. Hey. Go get some rest. I got him. Freya: Okay. Okay. Penelope: As soon as you get out of here, we need to get you a haircut. You do realize I almost died tonight, right? Plus, I'm not seven. But I will always be your mom. Thanks, man. (Clears throat) Yeah. Just doing my job. Elyse, is this what you wanted? I'm not the psycho you think I am... at least I wasn't. I-I just... I love him more than you could understand. I do understand. I just don't think you want to wander this world filled with anger and regret for the rest of eternity, which is what will happen if you don't leave soon. You have less than an hour until sunrise. I left Killian once. I don't think I can leave him again. If you really love him, that's exactly what you will do, for both your sakes. I can't force you, but I can help you if you let me. Hey. Hey. Can't sleep? Uh-uh. Wendy told me about Adam. I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have done it. I'm not mad at you. I do understand, Ingrid. You're in love. So, what am I going to do now? I don't know. I guess you have a decision to make. That's it? Yeah... That's all I get? Yeah. Shouldn't you give me some kind of motherly advice, like "Follow your heart" or "Do the right thing"? Follow your heart. Do the right thing. (Laughs) (Crying) That's not very helpful. They're not the same thing in this case. Mom, I've never been in love before. I didn't think it was possible for me. What do I do? You know what I can tell you is that I have known you over many years, over many lifetimes, and I have seen you love before. This is not the first time and it won't be the last. ADAM NOBLE Beloved Son and Friend I don't want to leave. I don't want you to, but I can't hold you back from where you belong. But you can always come get me, right? Summon me again if you miss me? I asked Wendy about that, and... ...she said you only get one trip back here. This was it. The spell won't work a second time. When you go this time, you go. I'll be watching over you. 'Cause we're always going to be connected. Okay, you ready? You know, we're a lot more alike than I first thought. I was torn between Dash and Killian, too. Take care of him. Take care of both of them. Make sure that they don't hate each other forever. You ready? Spiritus... Revertatur ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur... ...ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur... Spiritus revertatur ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur... ...ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur ad interitum. Spiritus revertatur ad interitum. Good-bye. Oh, hello, you two. How nice to see you on this fine day. Is everything all right? You tell us. Everything is just perfect today, as far as I'm concerned. So glad to hear it. ♪ IN MEMORY OF INGRID BEAUCHAMP, 1876 - 1906
