 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 I don't want the girls doing magic. It's too dangerous. 
 You can't just bring someone back from the dead without consequences. 
 You resurrect someone you love, then someone you love has to die. 
 Do you want to try a fertility spell? 
 (both gasp) 
 The shape shifter that has it out for your mom has taken your mom's form, murdered Bill Thatcher... 
 Joanna Beauchamp? You are under arrest. 
 You killed her husband right before her eyes. 
 You look exactly the same. 
 Immortality will do that. 
 She had this strange little doll made out of hair. 
 It's called an energy talisman. 
 JOANNA: Is it supposed to suck away your powers? 
 WENDY: No, not supposed to. It does. 
 JOANNA: Ingrid! Freya! 
 No! 
 No... no! 
 (crying): No! No! 
 I'm sorry, Joanna. 
 Vidar! 
 But your girls were reckless with their gifts. 
 Vidar... 
 You turned them in? 
 Well, it had to be done. 
 What? 
 To keep our secret safe. 
 It was the only way. 
 No... 
 But you... you took my girls... 
 No! 
 They were all I had in this world! 
 No, please! 
 No! No! I beg you, no! 
 No, please, no! Spare me, I beg you! 
 Aah! No! Please, spare me! 
 As you wish. 
 (yells) 
 Season 1, Episode 4 
 "A Few Good Talismen" 
 You actually cut off his ear? 
 That is so badass. 
 Now, I think you girls are maybe missing the point. 
 INGRID: Are we? 
 FREYA: What's the point? 
 JOANNA: The point is that even in that moment, when I thought I'd lost everything, I mustered up the courage not to kill him. 
 Is she giving you the 
 "we don't kill" speech? 
 Well, we don't. 
 I like it better when your witchcraft lessons contain lessons on doing actual witchcraft. 
 Your mom's just trying to teach you to be responsible. 
 Cut her some slack. 
 Thank you, Wendy. 
 I, on the other hand, am the fun aunt, so I don't have to worry about that. 
 And here we go. 
 WENDY: What? I missed these girls. 
 I didn't get to see them grow up this time. 
 So, to make up for lost years, I'm gonna give you today's lesson free of charge. 
 Use your magic as much as you want. Just don't hurt anyone. 
 Only use it in an emergency. 
 WENDY: And... For fun sometimes. 
 (both scream) 
 (Wendy whoops) 
 Oh, my... 
 (laughs) 
 (gasping) 
 (doorbell rings) 
 That's Harrison. Don't worry, I'll get it. 
 You girls have fun. 
 Principal Redmond! 
 Oh, hey. 
 Today's gonna be easy. 
 You're gonna take Principal Redmond's deposition... 
 And-and that's it. 
 Okay? 
 Thanks for picking me up. 
 Hi. 
 The least we could do. 
 I just thought the three of us could go down to the courthouse together. 
 You know, sort of a united front. 
 Well, I like how you think. 
 I really appreciate you doing this. 
 Oh, please. It's my pleasure. 
 It's insane what they're putting you through. 
 I'll do anything I can to help. 
 Thanks, Richard. 
 Shall we go? 
 Yes. Yeah. 
 (birds chirping) 
 (gps) Oh! 
 (chuckling): Hi. 
 I like these, surprise morning visits. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mmm. I'm gonna miss them once we're living together. (chuckles) 
 So, what was she like? 
 Uh, who? 
 Elyse, your ex-fiancée. 
 Did your mom like her? Did they get along? 
 Is that what this is about? 
 My mother doesn't hate you, Freya. 
 She doesn't like me, either. 
 Okay... 
 (sighs) 
 Look, I know my mom... 
 I know she can be kind of difficult to get to know. 
 Alright? And-and, look, maybe it's because she raised us on her own after my dad died, so she's... 
 She's a little overprotective. But I know she'll come around. 
 How could she not love you? 
 And please... look, don't worry about Elyse, either. 
 That-that was a long time ago. She couldn't hold a candle to you. 
 I'm not asking about Elyse because I'm insecure. 
 I just... I think it's weird that this was such a huge part of your life and you've never told me about it. 
 I just want to put it behind me. 
 That's it. I'm sorry. 
 You're my family now, Freya. 
 I want us to be open with each other about everything. 
 No secrets. 
 Okay? 
 Exactly. 
 No secrets. 
 BARB: Isn't it beautiful? 
 INGRID: It's gorgeous, Barb. 
 I know, right? 
 This is really happening. You guys, this is my baby. 
 It kind of just looks like a blob. 
 A majestic and extremely attractive blob. 
 Okay, I'm gonna go stack something. 
 (Barb and Ingrid chuckle) 
 Hey, you realize that this is all happening because of you, right? 
 And that magic spell? 
 That fake spell didn't do anything. 
 It was the power of positive thinking. 
 Well, whatever it is, this is a dream come true. 
 And I talked to Bob, and we want to say thanks in the only way we could. 
 And I know it's early, but you're like family, Ingrid. 
 And we'd like you to be the baby's godmother. 
 Oh, my God, Barb... 
 Yeah? 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 Aw... 
 We are gonna spoil this kid rotten. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (both chuckle) 
 Hello, Freya. You can come in. 
 Oh. Hi. 
 I'm sorry. I-I didn't want to bother you. 
 You looked like you were resting? 
 Oh, I wish. I-I haven't been able to sleep lately. 
 Ever since we moved in this house. 
 Oh, is that Dash and Killian? 
 Look at them. They're so adorable. 
 They were inseparable back then. 
 The best of friends. 
 But now... 
 They grew apart. That happens sometimes with brothers. 
 Freya, we both know a woman came between them. 
 Dash mentioned that he finally told you about his engagement to Elyse. 
 I'm sorry you had to find out you weren't the first woman he was going to marry. 
 Well, it was a long time ago. 
 I told him he should've been honest from the very beginning. 
 Secrets are poison in a relationship, don't you agree? 
 It's really not that big of a deal. 
 (chuckles) 
 It was a big enough deal to come between my boys. 
 Now that we're all in the same town, I want us to be a family again. 
 Well, Dash seems to have really made up his mind about this. 
 Don't be so sure, Freya. 
 I know my son. 
 Better than you could ever know him. 
 His mind can be changed. 
 Well, I wish there was something I could do to help. 
 Maybe there is. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, if anyone can talk to my sons, it's you. 
 Maybe you could convince them to come to dinner here tonight as a first step. 
 Oh, no, no, no. I-I don't think that's a good idea. 
 No, it's a perfect idea. It's wonderful. 
 Freya, please. 
 It would mean the world to me. 
 Um... 
 Okay. I'll do my best. 
 INGRID: So it went well, then? 
 Yeah, it went great. 
 Principal Redmond knocked it out of the park. 
 It went much better than I hoped for. 
 Well, he was my character witness. 
 Of course he's gonna say nice things about me. 
 Still, it's important for the judge to know what a good person you are. 
 MAURA: Joanna Beauchamp? 
 How can you sit here having lunch with your family as if everything is normal and fine? 
 I watched you kill my husband. You destroyed my life. 
 Maura, please, that isn't what happened. 
 It wasn't me. 
 I saw you. 
 You can't lie to me! 
 I think you need to calm down. 
 I will not calm down until this woman is locked away and rotting in jail for the rest of her life! 
 Shut up. 
 (gasping) 
 WOMAN: Maura, what's wrong? 
 (coughing) 
 I'll take care of it. Just... 
 Get them out of here. Go. 
 What just happened to her? 
 HARRISON: Call 911. 
 (coughing) Mrs. Thatcher. 
 Wendy has got to be more careful. 
 Maura landing in the hospital after a public confrontation with your family doesn't help your case. 
 Believe me, I gave her an earful. 
 But you know Wendy. She's not exactly one to... 
 Think before she acts, and she was just trying to protect me. 
 So am I, my dear. 
 All right, so this is it. 
 This is where Bill Thatcher was murdered. 
 Ooh. 
 (chuckles) 
 The dark energy's palpable. 
 What are you getting? 
 Uh, I can feel his pain. 
 I got her murderous intent. 
 (exhales) 
 It's stronger than I thought it would be. 
 What are you gonna do with this energy? 
 I'm gonna work out the shifter's next move. 
 I'll be back here. Yeah. 
 Mm-hm... 
 (exhales) 
 Revelabunt tenebris nex. 
 Revelabunt tenebris nex. 
 Revelabunt tenebris nex. 
 Revelabunt tenebris nex. 
 Revelabunt tenebris... Revelabunt tenebris nex. Please... Revelabunt tenebris nex. Please, I know this isn't who you are! Well, you don't know me as well as you thought you did. (sighs) HARRISON: Are you sure that's what you saw? Yes, the shifter's gonna kill Richard. It happens tonight at 8:30. How do you know that? JOANNA: He was wearing the exact same clothing he had on at the deposition, right down to the stain on his tie. And I saw a clock. Better get him out of there. Whoa, now, wait a minute. I mean, this is... this is the perfect opportunity. We know exactly where the shifter's going to be and when. I finally have the upper hand. You plan on using the principal as bait? Well, you have any better ideas? So did you know that we could affect people like that? INGRID: No, but I knew we could hurt people with our powers. It's kind of scary, right? Hey, Ingrid. Hey, Adam! What are you doing here? Well... I mean, you're eating lunch, obviously. My partner's waiting out in the car. Ah. So, uh... you still on for tonight? Definitely. 7:00, right? Mm-hmm. Unless you want to do 6:00. Or we could do 8:00. 8:30? 9:00's probably a little late. Okay. Okay. I'll see you tonight. Yes. All right. (giggles) Freya... Bye. Look at you, sunshine. Your aura is going nuclear, it's so bright. Will you stop reading me? It's like you're going through my underwear drawer. Oh, lighten up. I'm just happy my big sister's gettin' some. "A," lower your voice, and "B," all we've done is kiss so far. Give it a week. Scratch that. A day. Will you stop? I can't help it if you're in love. I'm not in love. Well, your words say one thing, but your aura says another. I can't be in love. Why do you seem so upset? Last time I checked, being in love is a good thing. I'm just... I'm not. That's all. I'm not in love with Adam. I can't be. We've barely started dating. Okay. Okay, whatever you say. Ugh. And now I have to go ask someone I can't stand to have dinner with someone he can't stand so that someone who can't stand me will finally start to like me. Wish me luck. I have no idea what you're talking about, but good luck. Thanks, darling. Technically, I'm still not talking to you. I'm here on behalf of your mom. She wants you and Dash to come to Fair Haven for dinner tonight. Why? Because it will make your mother happy. Why didn't she ask me herself? Because she doesn't know how to approach you, so I said I would try. Because you think I'd do anything for you? No, because I'm going to be your sister-in-law, and I want you and my husband to get along. Sorry. Can't. I have a date. You have a date? That's right. Fine. Never mind. But you could've just said that in the first place. DASH: Mrs. Thatcher, hi. I'm Dr. Gardiner. I know who you are. If you're uncomfortable, I can get you another doctor. But I can see you're in pain, and I think I can help you if you'd let me. (weakly): It hurts... right here. Okay, why don't we take a look. (coughs) (whispers): Okay. Let's open up. Uh, I'm gonna need you to stay very still. Okay? All right, don't move. Don't move. (low groan) (Maura clears throat softly) It... it feels better. Good. Good. I'm just gonna apply a topical anesthetic. I think we should keep you overnight for observation, just in case. (birds chirping) ♪ (sighs) (typing) (sighs) (typing) Mmm. FREYA: Hey, are you busy? I need some help. Is there a spell we can do to make Dash forgive Killian for sleeping with his fiancée? You slept with Killian? No, no. His other fiancée. Dash has another fiancée? He did, a long time ago. And Killian slept with her, and now they hate each other. So, how do I use my powers to bring them together? Are you sure that's such a good idea? It isn't for me; it's for Dash's mom. Ooh. Kiss-ass, huh? Hey, I'm gonna have to live with the woman, it would help if we got along. Okay, so you want a spell to make the boys forgive each other. That's a really tall order. You change the way someone feels about one thing, you risk changing how they feel about other things. Maybe even including how Dash feels about you. I don't think you want to mess with that. How about a spell to just get them to come to dinner tonight? Oh, a beacon spell... No problem, my friend. We just need to get you some supplies. ♪ His assistant said he should be headed home. Wow, I left him three voice mails, and he still hasn't called back. Think we're too late? No, the clock said 8:30. REDMOND: Joanna. JOANNA: Hi. Hey. (sighs) (cat meows) Well, hello, kitty. Who do you belong to? (cat meows) (meows) Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. (cat yowls) (soft gasp) Wow. Howdy, neighbor. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to scare you. (chuckles) Oh. No, no, that's quite all right. I'm nude... er, good. (nervous chuckle) Oh, uh, right, come on in. I'll get you some clothes. I just moved in upstairs, and I was about to take a shower... I accidentally left the front door open, and my cat ran out, so I chased after her, and now I'm locked out... no keys, no cat, no clothes. Well, you can stay here as long as you need to. I'm sure the super will be back soon. Are you sure? I don't want to impose. Nah. Nah, I'm just... doing my part to be neighborly. I'm Wendy, by the way. Leo. My name's Leo. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Oh, I almost forgot. Your cat. Do you want to go look for her? Oh, no, she's fine. She's a very clever kitty. 
 
 You guys really didn't have to cook me dinner. Oh, that's no big deal. Joanna can work magic... With a box of pasta and a well-stocked refrigerator. Well, it was the least that we could do after you gave such wonderful testimony today. Well... (clears throat) thank you again for the lovely meal. Uh... Uh, no, no, no, Joanna, I-I insist. You cooked; it's the least I can do. Uh, Richard, I hate to impose. Is there any way that I could have a cup of tea? I really, I think I'm coming down with something. Uh, sure, no problem. We'll have it in the living room. Great. (whispers): Nice one. (whispers): How are we going to stall him for another half an hour? No, don't worry about it. You should go. It's too dangerous for you here. No, I'm not gonna leave you alone to fight the shifter. Come on. You seem to forget, I'm a very powerful witch. REDMOND: Please, please, I know this isn't who you are. You don't know me as well as you thought you did. (grunts) Hey, Joanna... We're defin... we're definitely in the right place. We just have to give tonight a new ending. ADAM: Just a couple more steps. One... and... last one. All right, now we're gonna go over here. Keep those eyes closed. No peeking. Okay, uh... Open your eyes. Oh, Adam. Barb gave me the keys so I could set up. See? I can chase down bank robbers and be a romantic. Seriously? You've actually chased a bank robber? No, no, but I have arrested a drunk guy for trying to dismantle an ATM with a corkscrew. That's pretty cool, too. And I cooked. Sandwiches. Which I guess you don't really cook. So let's just say I bought sandwiches. But it's the-the thought that counts, right? It's beautiful. I can't do this. What? What, dinner? No. It's just, my life is really complicated right now, and I don't want you to get hurt. I think I just need some time. Wait, wait, wait, wai... What? I really care about you. So, you're gonna break up with me? Not that we can even break up. I mean, we've barely gone out. I just... I don't... Ingrid, what-what... What happened? Did... Did I do something wrong? No. No, it's me. It's my fault. I just... I can't... I can't do this right now. I can't handle it. I'm so sorry. In-Ingrid... (Adam sighs heavily) FREYA:  Fratres divisique. Praegero coaptandas. I hope this works, Wendy. Fratres divisique. Praegero coaptandas. It worked! (laughs) Wait. What? Don't go away. No, no, no, no, no, don't go. No. What?! WENDY: Oh! Wow! Look at the colors. This blue one is especially gorgeous. LEO: If you like that one, I got something you're gonna love. Okay. (gasps) Wow. That's the... The jewel of my collection... Himalayan Stamped Crown. Oh, it's so unusual. The intensity of the color, the way that it shimmers. I caught it myself. Trekked all the way to Kabru Mountain in Nepal just to find her. That's one of the rarest butterflies in the world. Really? Some people even say it has... Enchanted properties. You don't believe in that kind of stuff, do you? No, not usually, but catching this beauty was definitely a spiritual experience. It was one of those rare moments in life where you almost believe magic is real. I think I know what you mean. So, you're kind of like Indiana Jones. Only with a butterfly net instead of a whip. (both laugh) (sighs) Oh! Man. Would you please excuse me? Yeah. Wait. You're leaving already? I could stay for a few more minutes. You were just gonna go without saying good-bye? I'm not very good at good-byes. I'm much better at hellos. Well, hello, bug guy. HARRISON: What do we do? We wait. That's it? (sighs) Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna check the house out, all right? Just... No. Just... ♪ Oh, boy. (door creaks open) Hello? Anyone here? (piano plays gentle classical music) (stops playing) Hi. Hey. You came. Canceled my date. Thought, why not? Make Mom happy. I didn't know you played. I... It's been a while. Where is that piece from? I know I've heard it somewhere. I don't see how. I wrote it. Seriously? Don't look so shocked, all right? There's more to me than just phenomenal bartending skills. Yeah, apparently so. That was really good. You could play professionally. I used to think so a long time ago. Then I broke my hand, and after that, I was never able to play the same again. I have bad luck that way. Well, you still play beautifully. Thanks. Your brother should be here soon. I'm hoping. And on that note, why don't I track down a bottle of wine? Mmm. Think I could use a glass. (playing same tune) (gasps) (sighs) Oh, hey, baby. You came. Yeah, of course. I'm not ready to forgive Killian, but I'll do this for you and Mom. FREYA: Thanks, babe. You're the best. Mmm. I... I just don't get it, 'cause I thought you said everything was going so well. Can we please change the subject? Yeah. Yeah, that's okay by me. You know, you call the shots, and tonight is all about you. I'm just saying, I don't get it. There's nothing to get. It just wasn't worth it. You waited all those years, and it wasn't worth it? I mean, come on, this guy is perfect. I don't even think he has one flaw. Oh, you're right, he is perfect. Oh, yeah. And that's why I didn't want to risk it. This way, no one gets hurt. So you're hurting yourself so you won't get hurt? That makes no sense. I wish I could explain it. It's-it's just better this way. Okay. Uh, you need a drink. You do. So, Bent Elbow, here we come? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Okay. (groans, yells) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Barbie, are you okay? Oh, my... Oh, no, no, no. Call an ambulance! (loud breathing) Oh, no! No, God! No! (crickets chirping) I'm sorry. I have to go. I thought I could do this. I can't. I can't do this. No. Your mom is on the way. Please stay. I can't watch you with him. It hurts too much. DASH: So what are we gonna do for dinner? Uh, your mom is picking up Michelangelo's on the way home. Yeah. That's her idea of a home-cooked meal. PENELOPE: I heard that! At least I know how to pick a good restaurant. I don't know how you pulled it off, but I'm so glad to see the two of you in one place. Oh, come here. Oh. Actually, I was just, uh... I was just leaving. Oh, no. Killian. Sorry to hear. Yeah, well, I wish I could stay, but I have a date. A date? Well, can't you reschedule that? (phone ringing) KILLIAN: Let me buy you lunch tomorrow to make it up to you. Mmm. I missed you, Mom. I missed you, too. I have to take a rain check, too. They need me back at the hospital. Oh, for God's sake. I'm a mother without children. Dramatic as always. Oh. Sorry, baby. I'll call you later. You two have a nice dinner. Yeah. DASH: Mom. Okay. PENELOPE: Mmm. (sighs) Yeah. Well, I guess it's just the two of us. Richard? Is your clock broken? Richard? Richard...? Richard... Harrison...? Harrison... Redmond! (gasping) Harrison, we're too late. The shifter's already killed Redmond. Richard? Agedum! (groaning) Well, I guess you found Principal Redmond. Vidar...? It's been a long time, Joanna. (gasping) This time, I came prepared. (gasping) I'm sorry your family get-together didn't turn out the way you wanted. I did try. And I do appreciate it... But I may have been asking too much of you. Well, it seems like things will get better with Killian. With Killian... everything is always a struggle. I just wish I could have done more to help when I had the chance. I'm sure he understands. I was a bit of a rebel myself. Drove my mother crazy, but I don't hold it against her. He just had so much potential. I mean, he had the best schools begging for him to apply, so what does he do? Two weeks before the auditions, he breaks his hand in a drunken bar fight. Killian's afraid of being happy. It's why he's run away from anyone who ever loved him, including me. Well, I hope he stays around here for a while. For you. (sighs) Hey... How is she? She's in surgery. That's all I know. I can't get in touch with Bob... he's still out of town... But, God, Hudson, this is all my fault. Your fault? No, how can this be your fault? You got her to the hospital as quickly as you could. You probably saved her life, Ingrid. I don't know what I'll do if something happens to her. (owl hoots) I've waited a long time for this, Joanna. I'll be sure to take my time. (panting) Why don't we start with your ear? (sizzling) (Joanna screams) Tonight, the Beauchamp family line ends. It'd be sad... ...if you didn't all deserve it. No, please, please, I'm begging you, no. (groans) Please spare me. Please... Please, I know this isn't who you are. Well, you don't know me as well as you thought you did. (groans) I will protect my family at all costs, and this ends now. No, it doesn't. I'm not the one who framed you for murder. Your real enemy is still out there. Who is it? Who's the shifter? More will be summoned to replace me. Where are they coming from? Why is it happening? You won't win... Who is it? (Vidar gasps) Joanna... hey. Hey. Shh. (piano playing) (stops playing) That's pretty. Well, you know, I did play the piano for six whole months when I was 12. (laughs) Your mom and I had a very nice dinner tonight. I would say there was a little bit of progress in our relationship. See, I knew you didn't have a thing to worry about. You're extremely lovable. (chuckles) And she's cool, you know. Once you get to know her, she's a... A little bit less intimidating. She's just a mom who cares for her sons. You know, I-I didn't like seeing Killian in my house tonight. I mean, I hate the fact that he's even in town, but I appreciate you going to all this trouble for my mom. The way you are with her... it just shows me how much you love me. I do love you so much. I know. You want to go to bed? Yeah. (both chuckle) (siren wailing in distance) Revive papilio. (gasps) Hello? (thunder rumbling) (crying): Wendy, I'm at the hospital. I just talked to the doctor. Barb's in surgery, she's lost a lot of blood, and they don't think the baby's going to make it, and it's... it's my fault. (thunder cracks) How can I look her in the eye after this? I did this to her. Barb is paying the price for the spell I cast, and... (siren wailing) No! ADAM: Ingrid! Adam. I heard about Barb, came as soon as I could. I'm sorry I was such a jerk earlier. Oh, no, no, no, you weren't a jerk. You were just scared, all right? I was moving too fast. No, I just... I freaked out, but it-it's not your fault. I'm just really screwed up right now. Hey, hey, hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. (phone ringing) Hello...? Yes. Yes...! Oh, my God, that's great news. Tell her I'll be right back. (laughing): Barb's okay. The baby's fine. Everything's going to be okay. Well, that's fantastic. Adam, your nose is bleeding. Huh? (groans) Adam! Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Adam! Adam! Help! Somebody, help! Adam? Adam, come back! (sobbing): Come back, come back, come back! MAN: Give us room. No vitals. (panting) (sobbing) He's not responding. He's gone. We lost him.
