 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 It's our family's Grimoire. 
 A spell book. 
 We should try one. 
 (Moaning) 
 You gonna introduce me? 
 Yeah. 
 This is Freya. Freya, this is Eva, my wife. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What happened? 
 I'm losing pieces of time. 
 I need your help. 
 Just go. 
 (Explosion) 
 (Snaps fingers) 
 Spirit of ashes and rebirth. 
 Give hope for what is to come. 
 Give honor for that which has passed. 
 And give always for what is the here and now. 
 Ex cineribus resurge. 
 (Wind whooshing) 
 Good-bye, Victor. 
 (Wind whooshing) 
 Mandragora.

 Ingrid:  Freya. 
 Freya. Freya. Hey. (Sighs) Why did you do that? What is going on? (Sighs) You haven't answered your phone in days. Are you sick or something? No, I'm fine. I'm great. At least I was until you just woke me up. What are you talking about? Do you remember that brownie recipe you used to remember your past life? Yeah. Well, I made my own version of it. Super concentrated. It's even stronger. Three drops on the tongue, simple chant, think of a year, and boom. You can revisit any life you've ever lived. So far, I've been to the '20s, I've been to the '50s, I've been to the '70s. Well, at least, I was in the '70s until you just woke me up. Yeah, I don't think this is a good idea. Are you kidding me? It's the best! You have to try it. I already have. And it was awful. I discovered I was in a cult. I experienced my own death, which hurt a lot. This is dangerous, Freya. No good can come from this. Ingrid, it already has. I have known Killian in every life I've been to so far. He always has a different name, sometimes Dash is there, sometimes he's not, and they're not always brothers. But still, it's him. And every time, we fall in love. I knew he was my soul mate. Which is why it doesn't make sense that we're not together now. Maybe I can use the past to figure out what that roadblock is in the present. Is it that, or are you using the past to hide the problems from the here and now? (Sighs) It's both. The here and now hurts. And the past feels so good. Trust me, it's not all good. Now, will you promise me you will throw this stuff away before you find out something you wish you didn't know? Yes. Good. Now get out of bed and get to work. (Sighs) I love you. I love you, too, hard-ass. (Both laugh) (Siren wailing) There's my favorite patient. Hey, Dr. Gardiner. Hey. Are you ready for this? I guess. I mean, all I have to do is stay asleep, right? Yeah. Just think of it like math class. (Laughs) Exactly. But seriously, you a little scared? All right, well, don't be. Dr. Benson is the best surgical oncologist we have here. (Whispers): But don't tell her I said that; her head will explode. And don't worry, Dr. Benson and I will both be right here waiting for you when you wake up. Okay? Thank you, Dr. Gardiner. Yeah. (Makes explosion noise) Joanna:  Well, now we know for sure  what's been killing people in the town. It's a Mandragora. But why would it even come here from Asgard? They're feral creatures. Not anymore. Grandfather figured out a way to capture and control them. He built an entire army to do his bidding. He must've sent this one through the portal after me. So you're saying this Mandragora who came after you is also going around town killing people, carving the King's symbol into their chests. Why? They hunt and they kill; That's what they do. That doesn't mean it's not here for me. Doesn't prove that it is, either. Joanna: It doesn't matter why it's here. We just need to find it and get rid of it, once and for all. We can't. Why not? You can't just kill a Mandragora. They're too powerful. That's why grandfather uses them. No one's ever fought one and lived to tell about it. Actually, I know someone who has. Excuse me, sir. Only employees are allowed behind the bar. Actually, Eva and I plan to stay in East End, so I needed a job. You're good with me working here again, right? It won't be... awkward? Of course not. Why would it be awkward? Because we kissed and you were almost my brother-in-law? Ancient history. I think you know that's not what I'm talking about. Dash told me, Freya. About everything. What do you mean? I know you're a witch. You do? I was really angry when I first found out. I felt like you lied to me about who you were. So then do you know that you're... A warlock? Yeah, I know. And I have just one question. Of course. Ask me anything. When'd you figure it out? What do you mean? When you came to see me in Santo Domingo, did you know about my powers? Yes. But I wasn't sure if you knew yet. So why didn't you tell me? That's not against the code. I know. Everything just happened so fast. I mean, I got there, and you were married. So you would've told me if I wasn't married? No, no. That's not what I meant. I just... I just wasn't sure how to say it, I guess. Seems pretty simple to me. You just look me in the eye, and tell me the truth. You know what? You're right. I should have done that all along. From now on, I'm just gonna tell you the truth. The truth is, I'm still... Hey, guys. Killian: Hey. What's up? We need a fold-out couch. Pick one. I can't decide. My family is enormous and loud. They're threatening to visit. Pero yo los quiero mucho, porque ellos me dieron platanos. You speak Spanish? He's learning. For me. Except, you just said that you love them because they gave you bananas? That's what I meant to say. You're so adorable. Wow. We are dangerously low on olives. I'm gonna go back to the storeroom and grab some. It was nice to see you, Eva. Nice seeing you. I mean, that's all right. (Whispers): Come on, come on. Yes! No. Okay. (Sighs) (Panting) Benson: Let's go again. Clear! I just got the page. I heard the surgery went okay. What's going on? He crashed. Benson: Okay, let's go again. Clear! (Paddles thump) Dash: How long's he been down? Benson: 16 minutes. 16 minutes. I'm calling it. Stop compressions. Time of death... 11:28. We have to speak to his mother. (Sniffs) Yeah, just... give me a sec. Remotio... A morte. Remotio a morte. Remotio a morte. (Gasping) Dr. Benson, get over here. How did you resuscitate him? I don't know. I was standing here, he just woke up. Benson (Quietly): Can you tell me your name? Sam: Sam Jacobs. ♪ ♪ Where are we going? Right here. What? Is this... mystery man who fought a Mandragora and lived to tell the tale a hot dog vendor? (Chuckles) Joanna! Joanna: Alex. Hi. This is my sister, Wendy. Hi, nice to meet you. What do you want? Wha... okay. We have a problem and you're the only one I could think of who could help us. I wouldn't come if it wasn't a matter of life or death. You have 15 seconds. The portal opened. A Mandragora came through. Are you serious? It's already killed two people in East End. You know more about them than anyone else I've ever met. I didn't know where else to go. I just don't want more innocent people to die. I almost admire the fact that after all this time you have the gall to come here and ask me for help. But you can still go to hell, Joanna. (Engine starts) I take it that's a "no"? Take a deep breath. (Inhales) Okay, look, I know this is a little awkward. All right? But right now I'm Dr. Gardiner. Okay? Don't think of me as Dash. Dr. Gardiner. (Both chuckle) Okay, so, uh... Tell me what's been going on. Uh, well, you've seen the cuts on my back. I've been sleepwalking and losing track of time. And I know my mom can heal my injuries, but I'm worried about why it keeps happening. Okay, well, I'll order a full blood panel. We can start there. If there's a medical reason, we'll find it. Thank you, Dash. I mean, Dr. Gardiner. (Both chuckle) Dash. Dash: What's wrong? Your hands... That looks like the side effects of a spell. My... My cancer patient... Sam, he was dying and I started saying some words, but it wasn't even a spell and it revived him. Wait... was he dying, or dead? Dead. Oh, sh1t. So why does she hate you so much, anyway? Oh! Did you sleep with her husband? 'Cause in my experience, chicks don't like that. It doesn't matter; It was a long time ago. Wait, you're back? Where's the Mandragora expert? Good question. We don't need her. We can do this on our own. I don't know if we can. Are you sure about that? We don't have a choice. (Knocking at door) I'll get it. Hello? Alex: Where's Joanna? Alex? Oh, my God. Thank you so much for coming. Save it. I'm not here for you. I just don't want anyone else to die. Oh. You redecorated. Yeah, a few times. It's been 35 years. I'll have an iced tea. (Snorts) I'm not a waitress; get it yourself. Frederick, would you mind? So, have you found the Mandragora's mate? What do you mean? A Mandragora can only survive on a parasitic diet. That's... how it feeds. It takes in the energy of its partner during coitus. Wait. It feeds by having s*x? Oh, man, I wish I could do that. Uh, focus. Sorry. Alex: They have a permanent symbiotic relationship. A Mandragora and its mate are connected even when they're not together. So if you kill one... Exactly. The other one dies, too. Frederick: So maybe we should try to find its mate. Kill them, and just let the Mandragora die. No. We don't kill innocents. The mate's not innocent. They're collateral damage. We'd be saving lives, and it could take weeks, tracking them down. We don't have that kind of time. Look, just... tell me where you saw the Mandragora. I didn't. Well... No, not exactly. I found... One of its scales in the woods. Wow. Yeah. I can't believe you have this. We'll lay some veneno linea in a perimeter around the woods where you saw him. What is that? It's an energy field. It's like a tripwire. Once he activates it, we can use it to track him. Follow his trail. Okay. Let's go. All right. Let's go lay the trap. And that iced tea? Is terrible. Charming woman. Freya? You come in here? (Disco music playing) I don't like the way people are looking at you. (Laughing): Yes, you do. That's why you bought this club: To show me off. We need some more product. You've outdone yourself with this batch, baby. (Laughs) (Exhales) I am good. Who would have thought a witch could brew up the best coke on the eastern seaboard? We can barely keep up with demand. You don't actually need me, you know. You've got powers. I could teach you my secret recipe, if you want. I couldn't do it like you even if I tried. You got the gift, baby. Besides, we make a perfect team. I want to give you the world. Anything you want. Anything at all... It's yours. I'll be right back. ♪ ♪ (Whoops) I thought you were gonna tell him. I am. You just have to let me figure out the right way. It's not that difficult, Freya. Just look him in the eye and tell him the truth: You're in love with me, you're done with him. It's not that simple. Because you're in love with the drugs, too. No, that's not what it is. You think I don't know? You guys are legends around here. Your coke's like magic. No one can get enough. Especially you. You know, you've got a lot of nerve. Listen to me. You are so much better than this. You know you are. I love you. Walk away from him, tonight. I love you, too, Bobby. I've never felt this way about anyone. Good. Let's stop sneaking around. Leave him and be with me. I can't just... leave him. He's dangerous in ways you can't understand. I'm not scared of him. You should be. Dash:  Look, it's not like I had a spell memorized or anything. I just started speaking Latin. You are a warlock, Dash. You start chanting in Latin, something's gonna happen. Do you remember the words? Yeah.  Remotio a morte. It means "banishment of death." No. No, it means "removal of death." So? Isn't that the same thing? You can't just remove someone's death, Dash. It has to go somewhere. And this one went... Inside me. Sam's death is now inside your body. And if we don't get it out, you're going to die. (Gasping) This batch just came in from Miami. After you do your thing, we're gonna be able to charge double. Ut excelso excelsior. Ut fortis fortior. It's done. (Whoops) (Sniffs) (Laughs) Did I say double? We're gonna charge triple for this sh1t, baby. I don't want to use my gifts like this anymore. Using your gifts was your idea, remember? I know, and it was fun for a while. But now it just feels cheap and seedy. (Laughing): Oh, baby! None of this is cheap! I don't care about the money! This isn't the life I want to live. It's that bartender you used to work with, isn't it? What's his name? Bobby? Talk about cheap and seedy. This has nothing to do with him. You lying bitch! I know what you're doing with him! I know what you do with him... I saw you! Come on, baby, aren't you gonna fight back? Gonna fight back? I'm done. I'm leaving. Get your ass over here, now! Come here! (Yells) You think you can get away from me?! This isn't over! I'll find you! You're dead! You hear me?! You're dead! 
 
 Dash, the longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get. I don't understand. Ingrid, look, death isn't a thing. You know, it-it's a biological process. This isn't about biology. There is a natural cosmic balance in the universe. Nothing ever disappears completely. And nothing goes to waste. It's like what happened with you and Killian. A transfer of energy. Yeah, I know. There's a lot we can do, Dash. We have incredible power. But when it comes to life and death, there's always a price. When I first found out I was a witch, I brought my aunt Wendy back from the dead. It was impulsive. And I did it for all the right reasons just like you. But what I didn't know was that by doing it, someone I loved had to die. And they did. Balance has to be restored. And what am I supposed to do? Just kill a 13-year-old kid? No, not kill him. Return his death to him. "Munere mortis." "The gift of death." You have to put Sam's death back into Sam's body. As horrible as that sounds, it was his time to die. Not yours. Once the Mandragora activates the veneno linea, the bowl will shatter. And then? He'll leave a trail. And we can trace his steps back to his home. So, that's it? We just stand here until then, staring at the bowl? Mm-hmm. Come get me when something actually happens. (Grunts) There's a new man in your life. What are you... some kind of seer? I run one of the most successful hedge funds in the world. I didn't end up there accidentally. Yes. I'm "some kind of seer." Oh, cool. I read tarot. Cute. Tarot. It's like a kid's game. So, what happened between you and my sister? Why do you hate her so much? She didn't tell you? No. Why am I not surprised? This man in your life, he wears a uniform. Mm-hmm. Yes, he does. Mmm. He brings out your fire. Uh-huh. But you're keeping him at arm's length. You're scared. No, I'm not. No, it's-it's okay. It makes sense. You've been hurt... a lot. Do you want to know how this turns out? No, she doesn't. Yes, I do! I can see your future, Wendy. Very clearly. Joanna: I just told you. Wendy doesn't want to know her future. Don't speak for me. I want to know. Whoa! I'm heading to the woods. What is that? This dart contains a poison called discidium. Enough to kill even a Mandragora. I'm coming with you. I am, too. No, I need you to stay here with Frederick. Neither one of you are coming. We've already discussed this. You're staying here. It's way too dangerous. He's after my son! Come on, Alex, I'm not gonna let you fight him alone. That's what makes it dangerous. Why are you always so damn stubborn? Says the stubbornest woman I've ever met. (Monitor beeping steadily) Dr. Gardiner? Hey. He's looking good, isn't he? Yes. Yeah, he is. Dr. Benson told me what you did. How you saved Sammy after everyone else had given up. I don't know how to thank you. The thought of living without him, it's just... There-there were a lot of other factors. I can't take all the credit. Well, whatever you did, it was a miracle. What do you mean? He's in total remission. He is? The test results came back clean for the first time in three years. There's no sign of the cancer anywhere in his body. Well, that's the best news I've heard all day. If-if you'll excuse me, Mrs. Jacobs. Of course, of course. (Indistinct radio transmission) Move, move! Out of the way! What happened? Male, 34, gunshot wound to the upper torso. He tried to rob a liquor store. Killed the owner, took a shot at the cops. They took him down. This freakin' hurts! Yeah, well, lucky for you the bullet went through and through. Looks like he's gonna make it? Yeah. Seems like the wrong ones always survive. (Gasps) Okay. After he crossed the veneno linea, he headed this way. And if we do end up fighting him, just, whatever you do, stay away from his tentacles. Why? When a Mandragora attacks, it uses its tentacles to inject a neurotoxin into the brain of its victim. It's not only very painful, it results in psychosis, and eventually death. Yeah, that sounds like something we should try to avoid. Oh, yeah. I got your back. (Knocking) Freya! You didn't tell me you were coming in from the city! I would've cooked. I wanted to surprise you. Aw! I've missed you, mom. You look so good. Thanks. You look awful. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting there. Oh. Wow, I didn't know you had company. Oh, honey, this is my friend. Alex. Freya, ooh! I've heard so much about you. We were about to make fondue. Please, join us. Yeah. So, come on. So, tell me. What's going on? I just ditched Dan. I am so proud of you, baby. Finally. But I met someone else, mom. I'm in love. For real this time. And we're moving to California. What?! Why, why so far away?! We want to be near the beach. There are beaches literally two blocks from here. I need to be as far away from Dan as possible. But you can come visit whenever you want. Maybe even play with grandkids. Wait, are you...? No. No. No, no, no. But I'm hoping, maybe, someday soon. Well, this calls for some champagne for a proper toast. (Chuckles) Hmm. This man you love, ooh, he's been waiting for you for a long time. He'd walk through fire for you. Oh. I want to know everything. Tell me it all. Where are we getting married? How many babies are we gonna have? (Sighs) What's wrong? This man you're about to marry, you've known him before. By many names, over many lives. I have? It doesn't end well. It never has. The two of you are star-crossed. I'm sorry. Wait, what does that mean? As long as the stars are in opposition, it doesn't matter how much in love you are with each other. You have to let him go. Now. Break this cycle of pain and death before it's too late. You're wrong. I wish I was. I have visions, too. I have the gift of premonition, and I've never seen anything bad happen to us. Well, maybe the drugs are clouding your vision. Tell my mom I had to go. (Sighs) Where's Freya? (Whispering): No. (Gasps) Not again. What the hell is happening to me? (Machines beeping) It's about time, man. I-I need something for the pain. Asshole, I said I'm in pain. Let me take care of that for you. Munere mortis. What are you saying? Munere mortis. W-what the hell are you doing, man? Munere mortis. Hey! Hey, hey, where are you going, man? (Screams, beeping increases) (Knocking) Hey. Dash, thank God you're alive. Did you do it? Yes. Yeah. Look, I know how hard that must've been. It is heartbreaking and tragic. I wish there was some other answer, but once someone's gone, you can't mess with that. You did the right thing. (Chuckles) Uh, Ingrid, I got your test results back. Look, everything checked out; There's no red flags. There's nothing physically wrong with you. You're fine. What's wrong? I'm not fine, Dash. I know I'm not fine. I can run some more tests. I don't want any more tests. Something is happening to me when I sleepwalk. Dash, I want you to do something for me. What? I want you to watch me sleep. (Groaning) Frederick! Curavi conrepito. (Gasping) What happened? You were having a seizure. Oh. "Oh"? That's all you got for me? Has this happened before? Ever since I came through the portal, it's been happening periodically. I don't know why. Okay, we need to tell your mother about this. No, not now! She has enough on her plate. (Grunts) I know that you have a lot of doubts about me, and I don't blame you. I have to earn your trust. But I don't want to worry her. But maybe she can stop the seizures. No, wait, please. Just... Promise me you won't say anything until after they kill the Mandragora. Alex: Look for an opening. Like a-a cave. Okay, got it. So, why were you so adamant about me not giving Wendy a reading? (Scoffs) Because I believe it's dangerous to know too much about your future. Besides, it didn't exactly work out so well when you read Freya. Is that why you shut me out? Alex, I'm so sorry. I just, I... I guess I got scared. I-I couldn't handle it. You're so intense. (Chuckles) That's what I thought you liked about me. Alex. Passion was never an issue with us, was it? (Rustling) Alex? No! (Gunshot) (Screams) (Gasping) What happened? I have no idea. What the hell is wrong with you?! I had him; He should be dead right now. It's Ingrid! If he dies, so does Ingrid. She's his mate. (Panting) (Disco music playing) Let's get the hell out of here. (Screams, gunshots) (Crowd screaming) Oh, my God! This is your fault! That's what you get. (Gasps) Oh, my God. So you've never seen anything like this happen before? Ever? No. And I've seen a lot. Look, Ingrid, I think this might be a situation where we should consult your family. You know, in fact, I'm surprised you haven't talked to them about this already. Why is that? Ingrid? Ingrid, is everything okay? (Bellowing) Ingrid! Ingrid! Stop! Settle down! Ingrid... (Screaming) Killian: Hey. You're still here? I thought you left hours ago. Are you okay? Actually, I'm great. I mean, I've had a hell of a day, but I'm... I have learned a few things. Just because you want something, and it feels really good, doesn't mean it's good for you. So, I... Just want to say, despite all of our history, that I'm glad you're safe. And you're happy with Eva. I think you guys are meant to be. Thanks. So do I. So, we good? Of course. Always. (Chuckles) Hi. Hey. Mi Amor. Long day. Thought you could use a drink. Thank you. I'll see you guys later. Mmm. That is delicious. Thank you. I'm glad you like it. Drink up. Dash! Ingrid! Are you sure she's here? This is where the tracks led us. It's the best chance we've got. Joanna: Ingrid, stop! Don't go with him! Ingrid. No. No!
