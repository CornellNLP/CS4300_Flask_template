 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 I was here first. 
 Actually, I was here first. 
 The whole "look at me, I'm so cute" thing doesn't work with me. 
 You murdered your own brother. 
 I didn't murder you! 
 FEYA: Killian is dead. 
 WENDY: It sounds like you had a vision.  You have a gift for premonition. So he might still be alive. (flatline) KILLIAN: What's happening to you is not scientific. You're not gonna find the reason in an MRI. DR. CARLYLE: I got the MRI scan. I found a match. Ingrid Beauchamp. Nice to see you again. WENDY: I knew something came through the portal. I tracked him to the woods tonight. We need to know who we're dealing with. There's a reason he doesn't want us to know who he is. Stay the hell away from me. What do you think the girls are gonna say when I tell them that you left their brother behind? JOANNA: Frederick? I don't trust him. The owl? It's a spirit animal. In Killian's darkest moment, he was visited by the owl. Where have you been? I c... I can't remember. Did anyone or anything come through the portal with you? (birds chirping) Hey. What's going on? I'm worried about Ingrid. What time did she come home from the bar last night? Uh, midnight? I don't know. Uh, she said she wanted to walk home. Uh, Ingrid? Call me back. Immediately. (sighs) I think something's happened to her. Mom. JOANNA: Oh, my God! Ingrid! Oh, Ingrid. (sniffs) Still shooting blanks? (cell phone ringing) (mutters quietly) Um... Yeah, uh, this is Dr. Gardiner. (digitally altered male voice): Did you receive the e-mail I sent you? Y-Yeah. Yeah. I saw you kill your brother. I have the evidence. Would you like me to send it to the police? No. Then I'm gonna need $50,000 in cash today. Today? That-that's impossible. Not for you it isn't. It's a federal holiday. The banks are closed. There-there's no way. We both know you're loaded, Dr. Gardiner. Figure it out. I'll be in touch. You're screwed. Back off! You better get a hold of this before you kill someone. I mean someone else. FREYA: She's so cold. Well, she's alive that's what counts. Ingrid? Ingrid. (sighs) What happened? You must have been sleepwalking again. Either that or she passed out cold in the yard. What? I'm just saying she was pretty drunk last night. Oh, my God. That's all right, Sweetie. We'll heal those. What about the sleepwalking? We'll have to find a spell. This isn't safe. You know what's crazy is that I think that was the best night's sleep I've had in years. (both laughing) And I'm starving. I want pancakes... Yeah? and eggs and bacon and tacos! I would kill for a taco! All right. Let's get you inside. I'll make some eggs. Besides, uh, we need to talk. Okay. First I want to say I am sorry that I didn't tell you girls the truth sooner. I really, I really did have my reas... reason... Well, we can talk about that later. So... okay. (laughs) Here goes. All right. 400 years ago, in Asgard, there was a war. And... You have a brother. And he's upstairs asleep. What?! Thank you, Wendy. It's like a Band-Aid. You just got to yank it off. A brother? Are you kidding? Wh... how could you've never told us this?! I'm so sorry. Leaving Frederick behind was one of the most painful decisions I've ever had to make. Actually, he chose to stay behind in Asgard all of these years with your grandfather. Otherwise known as the guy who cursed all of us. But he's been through a lot since then. And he barely escaped with his life. And we're very lucky that he did because it was Frederick who cured me last night. The argenteum is completely out of my system. Wait, what? How does that happen? How can he do that? I-It's a miracle! So, our brother is the one who came through the portal. But Wendy saw a shadow in the woods and she said his aura was vicious and predatory. Exactly. Well-well, we think that someone else came through the portal at the same time and that's the dark aura that Wendy saw in the woods. It might... It was. It was. ...have been. Freya, Ingrid. (quiet laugh) I can't believe it's really you. (quiet laugh) Now, you used to wake me up  in middle of the night, Freya. In the dead of winter. "I want to watch the sun rise on Ayre Beach." (laughs) Which, mind you, is a thousand miles away. And I was so mad at you. I just wanted to sleep. But I could never refuse you, either. So, we-we'd do the spell. We'd join hands and then... there we were. Standing in the warm sand, watching the sun come up. We had some of our best talks on that beach. I still think about them. Uh, I don't understand. How would we get there? Well, we weren't actually there. We'd simply project our, uh, thought bodies. It's a spell we used to do together. That's astro-projection. That's incredible. Did you ever do that with me? No. No, it only works with Freya because we're twins. Oh, my God! That is crazy! I always wanted a twin. I used to talk about this all the time when we were kids. Do you remember? I know. I always thought she was just being narcissistic, like you wanted another version of you around. But I think somehow you knew. You're both exactly the same. I missed you so much. (laughs) (little gasp) You know that Frederick is alone in the kitchen right now with your daughters while you're out here what? Pulling weeds? (laughs) I'm not pulling weeds. I'm picking radix sinceritate. Ah, truth root! If Freya's right and Dash does have powers, I want to confirm. She could be in real danger. So, I'm gonna put it in a pie I'm making and take it up to Fair Haven later. You want to come? That's your plan? Magic pie? He doesn't have to eat it all. He just has to get a whiff of it. It's pretty strong stuff. I saw Dash last night. He is angry, volatile. We have to approach this carefully. That was the idea. Are you in or out? Oh, I'm in. Um, while we're at it, uh, I think m-maybe we should just give Frederick a little bit of the pie. Wendy, get off of it! I don't need a truth root. When Frederick healed me last night, I saw the truth. I could feel his love for me. And all he wanted to do was heal me. And I know how ridiculous and naive it sounds. I haven't forgotten what he did to us. But I could feel his pain and his regret. He knows that he betrayed us. And he was brainwashed. Or he... might still be. Well, he had the presence of mind to escape, and I think that should tell you something. Or he pretended to escape so that he could play on your guilt and sympathy. Yeah, well... Mm. (gasps) She was naked? Are you kidding me? Ingrid? Naked in public? Naked and drunk as a skunk on mead, shouting to the rooftops,  "Ero regina!" Why was I shouting, "I will be queen"? Well, you are a princess. I am? What? Mom? I cannot tell you how happy this makes me. My whole family together together finally. Why would you not tell us that we're royalty? (groans) Because being royalty in Asgard is kind of irrelevant in this world. And on that note, as I am no longer a princess, I'm going to work. But I'll meet you all at the park later for Fourth of July! Where's Father? Is he coming with us? JOANNA: Uh, I left him a message. He's out of cell phone range. He's actually in South America. He went to look for a cure for the argenteum poisoning. But he is going to be so happy to see you again. WENDY: Oh. (quiet laugh) So, Frederick? I haven't had a chance to ask. How's, uh, how has it been in Asgard with Grandfather all these years? FREDERICK: Not long after you all came here, I realized the mistake I made. I tried to save him. To convince him to give in to his better nature. But he grew more and more paranoid and corrupt. And I became the receptacle of that rage. In the end, I almost wished for death. (quiet laugh) But I'm here now with my family where I belong. And that makes all the difference in the world. There. You can't even see the wound. You heal very quickly. Must be the Caribbean sunshine. You're a very distracting man. And I'm already late for work. Take the day off. Spend it with me. I'm scared. It's only been a few days, but I already feel like I've known you forever. Like, we're connected. Don't you think that's strange. No. I don't remember how I got here, but I think it's the best thing that ever happened to me. Sidan du Fragade. Efter finns tyvarr inte hos oss. (grunts) Knátti moldveg sporna. Hogna atnam at fjorsjúka avá hon ekki kva. (grunts) (meowing) Well, hello. (mews) What are you doing? You're new in town. Come here. (purring) Oh, yeah. Want a treat? Oh, you like that? All right. I'll be right back. I'm serious. It's just... I have him as a little visitor... (whistles) Oh... I think he's gone. Sorry. (movement nearby) (pencil moving on paper) (pages turning) (pencil moving on paper) Oh, Dr. Foster. What are you doing here? I thought I'd get started sorting through the materials. Well, that's very kind of you, but I'm pretty sure this is what you hired me to do, which is why I showed up today. If you had other plans, don't let me stop you. Oh, uh, that's my stack. I just did those. So, um... Dr. Foster, I'm pretty sure all this work is part of my job description as chief curator of the Venkman Collection. I mean, this is what I'm supposed to be doing. That's why you hired me. (laughs) Here's the thing. Um... I didn't hire you. Of course you did. You called me last night. After my department head Dr. Pavlicek called me. She was the one who insisted we hire you. It was over my objections. Oh. So, I'm here to make sure that nothing goes wrong, because if it does, it's basically my ass. You know what? Why don't I get started on these? And I am sure in no time, you will see that your ass has nothing to worry about. (quiet laugh) You really going through with this? I don't have a choice. This isn't gonna end here, you know. He's gonna use you as his personal ATM until there is nothing left. Oh, will you please shut the hell up?! Hello, Dash. What are you doing here? We come bearing gifts. Well, if this is a peace offering, you can keep it. Dash, we feel terrible about what happened. Oh, okay. You mean Freya ditching me at the altar? Or my mother committing suicide? Look, this is awkward, but we all live in the same small town and we're gonna have to talk to one another sooner or later. I don't see why. I have nothing to say to either one of you. I think the Beauchamp women have done enough. Excuse me. Um... Well, that went well. ♪ ♪ MAN: That's a scare card, brother. What are you gonna do? A thousand. You got the flush or the straight? Let's find out. Five. $10,000. All in... brother. Call. You made the call on a pair of twos? Better than a busted draw. (chuckles) No one is this lucky. No hard feelings? How 'bout I buy a round, yeah? I'm not thirsty. I would like my money back. (bones crackling, man shouts) (people gasping, screaming) (screams) Brujo! (shouts) Well, considering I was planning my own funeral yesterday, I'm enjoying today a lot more. (chuckles) (low whooshing) Ooh. Did you feel that? What? There's a chill in the air. It's 85 degrees out. Are you okay? I have a bad feeling. FREYA: Whew! (sighs) Why does it occur to me only after we've lugged this thing across the park we could've used magic? Magic doesn't solve everything. Sometimes it just makes it harder. That's what she said. Right. That is what she said. (chuckles) No, no, it's-it's a joke. That magic makes things harder? Who wants Chardonnay? I do. Oh, I knew I forgot something. The bottle opener. What? Allow me. Oh... WENDY: Oh, oh. Uh, thank you, but... we... mm, we don't do that in public. Do what? Magic. Why not? Just don't. We'll explain later. Here we go. Frederick, um, I haven't really gotten the chance to say thank you. For what? For saving my life. I know that just saying "thank you" doesn't quite cut it, but... I don't think I can ever repay you. You don't have to. We're family. And you would have done the same for me. This must be pretty hard for you, huh? Just suddenly being here. Everything is so different. For the first few days, I was so weak I could barely move. But at the same time, I-I could feel how close I was to you, you know? And that-that gave me strength. You know that spell you were talking about this morning? The one where we could go places with our thought bodies? Yeah. Well, if the spell allows us to go to another place, do you think it could also help me find a person? It's worth a try. Cheers. Cheers. (chuckles) Wow. An Occult History of Sorcery. Must be nice working in a public library. Mm-hmm. Low stakes, no pressure, no one to impress. I envy you. (phone rings) Oh. Excuse me. (quietly): Whatever. (gasps) "Le Clan de Beauchamp." Oh, my God. It's us. The Dagger. The Bridge. The Traveler. The Gatherer? Who is that? "La Clé." The Key. EVA: I heard what happened. Rum's not gonna help. It has so far. Tell me what you saw. I broke his hand. I don't know how. He was ten feet away. What the hell is a "brujo"? "Brujo" means "witch." He thinks you are Obeah, someone who has magic. (scoffs, stammers) Yeah. (exhales) So you think that I have... Magic. You tell me how much have you won at poker since you came here? I don't know. A lot. And you said it was like you knew the cards. Even when you didn't see them. Right? My grandmother,  she was a Santera. She believed that there were people who were naturally aligned with the spirit world. And this gave them special abilities. There's a ceremony she taught me. Maybe we can find out if you're one of these people. Are you afraid? No. A little. We can do it right here. I just need to gather a few items. 
 
 This looks totally different than anything in the Grimoire. That's because this is much, much older. Biór fori brynings apaldr. Magni megintíri; fullr er hann lia godra galdra gamanruna. Now speak the name of the one you seek. (exhales) Killian Gardiner. Again. Killian Gardiner. Good. Get ready. (chiming) (door slams) (exclaims) Where are we? I have no idea. Look around. But whatever you do, don't let go of my hand. Look. "Hotel El Corazon." Okay. He's here. He's in that room. (screeching) (owl screeching) What the hell was that? I'm not sure. Owls can be omens of fortune or doom. There was an owl in his tarot cards. I think we just met it. Well, that one didn't look very fortunate. It looked more like doom. But at least now I know where he is. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go find him. (indistinct chatter) No, Santo Domingo. A direct flight, if you've got it. The sooner the better. MAN: Ma'am, I'm very sorry, but I don't see any flights Can I get a strawberry margarita? to Santo Domingo today or tomorrow. Nothing today or tomorrow? What about Tuesday? Uh, can we get another round? (sighs) I'm gonna have to call you back. WOMAN: Is that a swan? FREDERICK: No. No, it's a Pikachen. What's a Pikachen? (soft laugh) Well, it's like a swan. (short laugh) Wow. Thank you. It's really cool. FREYA: Ah, you're making friends. It's a lot easier here than it was in Asgard. Hey... That spell we did was amazing. I've never felt anything like that. Well, that's what it means to have a twin. Well, I'm glad you're mine. See you later for fireworks? You bet. Hey. Be careful. Is there danger? No, but, just, don't go around doing... you know... What? Witchcraft. I'm saying, just no spells. I'm just saying no magic... Yeah, I know. I'm messing with you, Freya. I get it. I learn fast. I'll follow the rules. Okay, cool. (whispering): "Les quatre capacités arcanes "de celui connu comme la clé." "The four "arcane abilities... of the one known as The Key." (soft breathing) I have four arcane abilities? (low growling) What are you doing? Oh, I was just identifying the French dialect used in this volume. This is by far the oldest piece in the collection. Yes. I had no idea it was even here. The colophon identifies the city of origin as Marseilles. You're weren't handling it properly. Not handling it properly? This volume should be in a dehumidifier. We have one at the special collections library. Are you crazy? This is an illuminated manuscript. You'll dry out the parchment, the ink separate, you'll destroy it. I'm taking this with me. I'll send for the rest Monday. (low whooshing) (grunting) Mm. Maybe you weren't handling it properly, Dr. Foster. If anything happens to this volume between now and Monday, I'm holding you responsible. (low whooshing) Hi. (gasps) I really wish you would stop sneaking up on me, Frederick. I wasn't sneaking, I was just looking for Mom. We're over there. Oh, I, uh, found this on the porch. Is it yours? Thank you. You're welcome. Ma'am. It's nice to see you again. You know, we haven't been formally introduced. Tommy Cole. Not interested. Oh. No, but yesterday it kind of seemed like we were clicking. No, we were fighting. But you liked it. And so did I. So you don't want to maybe spar a little now? (chuckles) Be honest you have someone in your life, don't you? Daddy. Some... Daddy come on, let's play water guns. Hey. Yes. Okay. You nailed me. Yeah. This is my daughter, Katie. And her mom dropped her off this morning. We're together for the weekend. I'll tell you what, go fill the water guns, and I'll be there in a second. So you're divorced? Uh, separated. But, you know, we're heading that way. Why is that a deal breaker? I guess I'm just not used to baggage. Right. Other people's baggage. We've all got something. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." You just quoted Tolstoy. (gasps) The EMT is full of surprises. Who knew? (chuckles) Yeah. Huh. Okay, look, I like you. So if you want to get together sometime... my number's 911. No. You did not just do that. Yeah. Wow. (indistinct chatter) ♪ ♪ Thank you. Long line. Where's Frederick? What do you mean? I just saw him a few minutes ago. He was looking for you. I haven't seen him. Huh. (low whooshing) (inhales sharply) You seriously don't feel that? Fine, take it. (rustling) (rustling) (Foster screaming) Repeat after me. Chango. Yemaya. Ochun. Chango. Yemaya. Ochun. Again. Chango. Yemaya. Ochun. Keep going. Chango. Yemaya. Ochun. Call the spirit to you. Espíritu venga a mí. Espíritu venga a mí. (gasps) Oh! What the hell was that? I knew it. This proves it. You are brujo. You have the gift. No. I don't understand. If I have this gift, how can I go my whole life without ever realizing... Maybe you needed to find someone like you. So you could be awakened. You, too? Of course. Of course. Ever since I met you, I've sensed it. We're the same. I think that's why we found each other. We're meant to be together. (panting) Hey. How 'bout another beer? Be right with you, sir. I've only got three arms. That's what you said ten minutes ago. I want my beer. I think maybe you've had enough. Let's get you some food. Can we get a burger on the house, please? I didn't ask for a burger. I told you... Hey. Let go of me! (grunts) (bystanders gasp) (yelps) Frederick, stop! Frederick, stop. Let him go! Let him go! (coughing) Wait, Frederick. Please, stop. (Freya speaking distantly, man coughing) Frederick! Stop! Let him go! (gasps) Okay. Okay. (gasping) Just stay calm. Stay calm, okay? It's okay. Okay. Good to see you. Happy Fourth of July. Ingrid. Dash. Hi. Sorry. I don't mean to be bothering you. No, no, it's okay. I'm just, um... How are you? Uh, I've been better. I am so sorry to hear about-about everything. Your mother and... Thank you. Look, you don't have to apologize for anything. I know but still. Um, Ingrid, this is... this is gonna sound really weird. Okay? Really weird. But... I wanted to ask you something. Um, okay. I have this patient at the hospital. Okay? And he's been having these really strange symptoms. So we gave him an MRI and... we noticed these very rare anomalies in his brain mapping. As it turns out, we've only had one other patient who had similar anomalies. Um... that patient was you. Me? Yeah. Apparently we ran the scan because you were brought in with a concussion. The file says you fell off the jungle gym. Right. Yes. In third grade. I-I do remember. My mother was so upset when she got to the hospital. I'm just curious if you remember having any strange symptoms yourself. Either before the accident or after. No. No strange symptoms at all. So... Nope. Everything's been really totally super-normal ever since then. Ingrid, I am not trying to pry, really. But if you experienced anything at all, it's extremely important... FOSTER: He's here! Dr. Foster. He walks among us! He's carving the ancient symbol of the king! This is a warning to us all! (moaning) (bystanders gasp) Oh, my God. (gasping, shouting) Go ahead. (siren chirps) (siren wailing) Hey. I missed the show. Yeah. I'm glad I'm not on duty today. What happened? Just... Guy lost his mind. Started blabbing a bunch of nonsense. What kind of nonsense? I don't know. Just crazy nonsense. Do you know what the strangest part is? Two days ago, I brought in a guy to the ER. And exact same routine the wounds, the ranting... Wait, wounds? Yeah, he was all carved up like some sort of voodoo-looking sh1t. There's a serious sicko out there. What do you mean, voodoo? He had a... shape or something carved into his chest. It looked satanic. Okay, what was he ranting about? Why are you so interested in all this? 'Cause it's... I got to tell you, it's creeping me out just... I'm sorry. a tiny bit. I guess I'm just sort of fascinated by voodoo. Like... Wow. I'm drawn to the dark side. You're drawn? Okay. Yeah, I got a lot of stories. You do? Yeah. Maybe... tell them to you over drinks? I'll think about it. Okay. Just don't think about it too long. If anything I learned from this job is that life is short. You only get one. Yeah, don't remind me. ♪ ♪ Hey. FREYA: Hey. I just got your message. What's going on? I don't know. Something happened. It was scary. Frederick, are you okay? This guy grabbed Freya, and, uh... I just, uh... He was protecting me. Very aggressively. I'm sorry. I've spent so much time fighting for my life, sometimes I... I just lose control. (sighs) (thunder crashing) Well, that wasn't the most joyous of Fourth of July celebrations in history. Are you okay? Yes. Um, I have an announcement to make. As you all know, there have been a lot of changes around here. But there have also been a lot of changes with me. I don't know what it means that I'm the key, beyond the fact that I can open a portal to another dimension, but I'm ready to figure it out. And I love my new job. Even though my boss just died. But... the point is, I'm not the same person that I was, in this life or in others. And I think the sleepwalking, it's actually been my subconscious trying to tell me that it's time to take the next step, so... Oh, my God. You are worse than Mom. Spill it. Hey. I'm moving out. Wait, what? Are you seri... What is wrong? No, Mom, nothing is wrong. Everything is right. It's just... it's time for me to stand on my own. And now Frederick will have somewhere to sleep. (phone chimes) (Ingrid laughs, Joanna speaks indistinctly) Mom. FREDERICK: Well, I think this calls for a toast. Aw. I won't be far. (laughs) FREDERICK: To Ingrid! Aw. Too bad we missed the fireworks, right? Shall we do the honors? Yes. (chuckles) Oh, thank you. Cheers. (glasses clink) INGRID: You ready? FREYA: Mm-hmm. (inhaling deeply) BOTH: Caelum combure. Caelum combure. (fireworks exploding) Caelum combure. Caelum combure. (laughs) Wow. It worked. (exploding, whizzing) INGRID: Wow. (Ingrid and Freya laughing) Five minutes. I have everyone together for five minutes and now this. Two deaths, Joanna. One of them Ingrid's boss. And? And the EMT said there was some full-on voodoo sh1t. And what does that mean? It means that... we were looking for Frederick right before it happened. He said he was trying to find you. Wendy, please. Frederick didn't attack anyone. Yes, he did. You said it yourself. He attacked the drunk guy at the bar. Oh, who was messing with Freya. And Ingrid's boss was messing with her. There's a pattern here. We can't ignore it. I know my son. I know what he's capable of, even at his worst. He's not a killer. (Ingrid and Freya laugh) Mm. (chuckles) Cold? (gasps) Frederick. I know how you feel about me, Aunt Wendy. Do you? And I don't blame you. You've got it all wrong. You think you know me. But I promise you, you don't. Come back to the party. I love these fireworks. Oh, thank God. (chuckles) (Joanna speaking indistinctly) (Ingrid, Joanna, Freya laughing) (distant thunder rumbling) (phone ringing) This is Dr. Gardiner. (digitally altered male voice): You did very well today. Thank you. You're welcome. Now go to hell. Hold on. Today was just a down payment. The next installment will be $100,000. What do you mean the next one? I'll call you again with further instructions. Good night, Dr. Gardiner. (grunts) You know what to do next.
