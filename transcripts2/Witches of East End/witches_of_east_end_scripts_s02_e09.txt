 Previously on Witches of East End. 
 INGRID: As long as the doll stays under water no one will ever find the body. 
 I don't want this thing to end between us. 
 I can't put you in danger. 
 I'm not gonna leave you. 
 We can't keep killing random people. 
 We have to find someone who trusts you. 
 Do you trust me? 
 I promise you won't feel a thing. 
 I don't want you to die, too. 
 I love you, Mama. 
 I love you, too, baby girl. 
 (recording): Hey, it's Ingrid. 
 Leave a message, and I'll call you back. 
 I don't want to leave a message, I want to talk to you! 
 (grunts) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I still feel numb. 
 It's strange, but... 
 I kind of like it. 
 Just lie still. 
 (chants): Gaja ert ufi gest. 
 (laughs) 
 Is that Danish? 
 All right, I'll be quiet. 
 Do whatever you want. 
 I'm not afraid. 
 I trust you, Freddie. 
 You didn't complete the ritual. 
 Caroline is still alive and well. 
 Which is strange, because according to our plan, she should either be dead or the living vessel of our king. 
 (screams) 
 But, instead, she's home, asleep in bed. 
 You didn't do what you were supposed to do. 
 I'm done working with you. 
 I'm done taking orders. 
 I'm not giving them any more. 
 I'm taking matters into my own hands. 
 I won't let you hurt Caroline. 
 I don't need her. 
 I've found someone... much better. 
 Who? 
 But first, you need to be taught... a lesson. 
 (kettle whistling) 
 (door slams) 
 Mom? 
 Frederick, my God! 
 (faintly): Help me. 
 I'm sorry! We don't open for another hour. 
 It's me, Ingrid. 
 Freya? 
 Okay. 
 I've had three shots of espresso because I couldn't sleep last night. 
 So, either I'm starting to lose my mind, or everything is suddenly, totally clear. 
 Good morning. 
 No, not "good morning." The worst morning. 
 I would offer you coffee, but I think you've had enough. 
 What happened? 
 I had s*x with Killian last night. 
 What?! Oh, Freya! 
 Don't "Oh, Freya" me! 
 Skip the judgment, okay. 
 I feel awful enough right now. 
 Okay, sorry. I'm not judging. I swear. 
 So, what happened? Was it bad? Is that why you're so upset? 
 No! It was incredible. 
 Hot. Emotional. Intense. 
 It was beautiful. 
 Exactly like I always thought it would be. 
 Well, that's great, except... 
 and no judgment, but... 
 I know he's married. he's married. 
 Which makes it wrong. 
 But! 
 He loves me, Ingrid. 
 He told me last night that he still dreams about me, 
 and that he wants to be with me. 
 So, he's leaving Eva? 
 No. 
 See, that's the thing that makes no sense. 
 So, after we were together, he went to tell her that he wanted a divorce. 
 But then when he came back to the bar, he changed his mind. 
 Oh, Freya. I'm so sorry. 
 I just don't understand what is happening. 
 Well, there's always been a tension between you guys. 
 It had to get released at some point. 
 But you said you saw his aura, and he... loves her, too. 
 She is his wife. 
 But she's also a witch. 
 She is? 
 Yeah, yeah! 
 Which is why none of this adds up. 
 What do you mean? 
 What are the odds that he just happened to change his mind about leaving her for me. 
 She did something to him. 
 Some sort of spell to make him think that he loves her, 
 and forget that he loves me. 
 I don't know, sweetie. 
 You sound a little... 
 I am not crazy. This makes perfect sense to me. 
 She's messing with his mind. 
 Why else would they have gotten married so fast, huh? 
 Because he's in love with her? 
 And she's beautiful, intelligent and really, really sweet? 
 She is not sweet. 
 She is up to something. 
 I can feel it. 
 I just have to find proof. 
 Okay, now you're scaring me. Just a little bit. 
 You sounlike a crazy stalker lady. 
 No, I am a smart stalker lady. 
 And a badass witch. 
 Once I figure out what she's up to, Eva's not gonna know what hit her. 
 (dings) 
 (dinging resonates) 
 (wind chimes tinkling) 
 (Tommy chuckles) 
 WENDY (giggling): That tickles. 
 TOMMY: Mm-hmm. 
 How's this? 
 That's better. 
 You're making my inner kitty purr. 
 (imitates cat) 
 (giggles) 
 So, what's next? 
 I was thinking pancakes, and bacon, and coffee, No, no... and maybe some orange juice. 
 What's next for us? 
 Now that melting my brain is off the table. 
 And we're staying together even though I know you're... a witch. 
 Damn. I'm never get used to saying that. 
 Don't! 
 It's better if you try not to... say it. Ever. 
 Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. 
 No, I know that you won't, but my sister is gonna have a nuclear meltdown when she finds out. 
 So, we have to proceed with caution. 
 (whispering): Extreme caution. 
 Yeah. 
 WENDY: Oh, my God. 
 Is that the time? 
 (gasps) 
 My sister is going to be up. Okay. 
 We're gonna have to figure out a plan to get you out of here. 
 Maybe we can ask her to join us. 
 You jerk. 
 (grunts, laughs) 
 Okay. 
 I'll distract her. 
 And just to be safe, wait ten minutes, and then sneak out the garden. 
 (low muttering) 
 JOANNA: You were with Tommy last night. 
 You didn't spell him, did you? 
 How'd you know? 
 (laughs gently) 
 Okay, just... Joanna, keep an open mind. 
 You need to deal with it. 
 We've got other problems. 
 What? 
 JOANNA: How are you feeling? 
 Better. Thank you for healing me. 
 Here, sip this. Be careful, it's hot. 
 What happened? 
 I was attacked. By Mason Tarkoff. 
 What? I thought he was your friend. 
 So did I. 
 I've known him my entire life. 
 Wait, he fought on our side during the rebellion. 
 He pretended to. 
 He's still working for the king. 
 He's a telepath. 
 The most powerful one I've ever met. 
 They've been communicating for centuries. 
 Tarkoff's been monitoring things this side of the portal, and reporting back to the king ever since we arrived. 
 My cloaking spell kept him out of town until now. 
 He tried to get me to help him, and, when I refused, he tried to kill me. 
 Why? What did he need your help with? 
 He's trying to find a body for the king to inhabit. 
 Grandfather's been sick for years. 
 His mind and his magic are as strong as ever, but his body is deteriorated and weak. 
 He couldn't make it through the portal even if he wanted to. 
 JOANNA: That's what the Mandragora was doing here. 
 He was looking for a host body for the king's spirit. 
 Well, we have to kill Tarkoff. 
 I tried to kill him as soon as I realized what he was doing, but it didn't work 'cause he's a telepath. 
 He read my mind and knew what I was up to. 
 I think maybe you could do it, Mom. 
 You have a powerful mind, one that could confuse even the most gifted telepath. 
 I think you could stop him. 
 Maybe even kill him. 
 Sí, I know mi'hijita. 
 But no matter what happens, you will always be my favorite child. 
 Al egun les pido. 
 Concedeme lo que busco. 
 Dame un nino para poder seguir viviendo. 
 Gracias, egun. (gasps, laughs) (chuckles, grunts) - Ay, no, Mama... (gasps, sniffles) (sniffles) I think I just need to be alone for a while. (trembling): I'm gonna take a walk. (keys rattle) (door opens) You see how your mother's not talking? How she has an intense look in her eyes? Means she's getting ready to kick some ass. Be quiet, Wendy. I love when she gets this way. JOANNA: I've known Tarkoff since I was 16 years old. I always confided in him. He used to protect me. Really thought that I knew him. It was all a lie. (sets down object) FREDERICK: I'm sorry, Mom. You can't always trust the ones you love. (gasps) I told you she meant business. Death scorpions. What's a death scorpion? They're in stasis now, but I can revive them. And he won't see them coming, because he doesn't know what they are, because we're the ones who invented the spell. The first sting will paralyse you and the second will kill you. Even if you're a telepathic, warlock, asshole. I don't want to kill him yet. The venom will paralyze him for a couple of hours. It's enough time for us to find out his plans. FREDERICK: Only problem is, we don't know how to find Tarkoff. Or maybe we do. (sighs) (door closes) ♪ ♪ (quietly): You are a crazy, stalker-lady. (sighs) (bottle rattles) (gasps) (sighs) (grunts) (coughing) (phone chimes, sighs) Bruja! Deja a mi madre en paz! Te voy a matar... desgraciada...! (books shuffling) (footsteps approaching) (panting): Ingrid. Dash, what are you doing here? All right, look... we need to talk. We have nothing to talk about. (gasps) Where did you find this? Fair Haven. In the attic. It was hidden with a bunch of things that belonged to Archibald Browning. It is you... isn't it? I mean, he talks about you in his journals, he calls you Ingrid. It is me. And it's not... me. It's hard to explain. So, you read the journals? (sighs) Some of them. Uh, some parts are written in another language, I-I can't make it out, but some parts are in English. They're all about you. He loved you. And... and he thought... you loved him. And I'm a little confused right now, because... all of this happened over a hundred years ago. Okay. I guess we do need to talk. WENDY (sighs): All right... we need you and Frederick to do your astral projection, wonder-twin-magic. Find Tarkoff before he can find a host for the king. (sighs): What?! I don't think we should do this, it might be dangerous. FREYA (sighs): Why? Why? We won't actually be there, it's just our thought-bodies. What if Tarkoff senses us? Even if he does, he can't touch us. JOANNA: Freya, before you go. (sighs) Joanna, really... a travel talisman? We have to hurry. I don't like my children both going into the lion's den without protection. (Wendy sighs) Especially when that "lion" is the king. Now, once you find out where he is, (sighs) you get back here immediately and Wendy and I will take care of the rest. (sighs) You ready? FREDERICK: Bior fori brynings apaldr! Magni blandinn megintira fullr er hann lia godra galdra gamanruna. Now, say the name of the one you seek. FREYA: Mason Tarkoff. Mason Tarkoff. (whispering): Mason Tarkoff. (door opens) (wind whistling) (chimes tinkling) (children eerily giggle) (indistinct looped murmuring) TARKOFF (singing a cappella): 
♪ After you've gone... ♪ It's Tarkoff. (sighs) TARKOFF: ♪ And left me crying ♪ 
♪ After you've gone ♪ 
♪ There's no denying ♪ 
♪ You'll feel blue ♪ (warped screaming) ♪ You'll miss the ♪ 
♪ Dearest pal you've ever had ♪ 
♪ And there'll come a time ♪ 
♪ Now don't forget it ♪ 
♪ There'll come a time ♪ 
♪ When ♪ 
♪ You regret it ♪ 
♪Someday... ♪ (whispering): Who is that? It's Tommy. (sighs): Oh, God. (Freya panting) 
-♪When you grow lonely ♪ 
♪ Your heart will break like mine ♪ 
♪ You'll miss me only ♪ 
♪ After you've gone ♪ 
♪ Aer you've gone... ♪ 
♪ Away... ♪ (speaking): I know you know our secret. And that you're not afraid of death. (deeply inhales) That makes you... the perfect candidate to take on the king's spirit. Just as soon as I remove it... from Frederick. (Tommy grunts) Freya, it's not what you think. What? (Freya panting) Freya. Get away from me! (door closes) Tarkoff has Tommy! What?! What happened? (gasps) Give me a chance to explain. I can't believe we trusted you. Where are they? Where's Tommy? At that old, abandoned hospital, St. Gabriel's. Freya, what happened? WENDY: We need to go there now. Frederick is in on it! He's been carrying Grandfather's spirit this whole time! No, you don't understand. What is there to understand?! I heard what Tarkoff said. Is this true? No, it's not true. Then why would he say that? Because... because when I... (sighs) when I first came through... I had a plan. But I realized after being a part of this family, that I couldn't do it! We gave you another chance and you betrayed us?! Please, listen to me! Expergo! (Freya gasps) Freya, go... somewhere safe and in public. (gasping) (panting): Joanna.... we need to go now, we need to find Tommy before it's too late. (trembling): I'm sorry... I didn't want to hurt anyone. One more sting... that's all it would take. No more lies. WENDY: Joanna! Let's go! I came on a mission... it's true. The King sent me through the portal. What does he want? Just to talk to you. That's all he said. WENDY: Oh, please...! He wants to destroy us. Just give him the other sting; let's end this right now! Mom... please... just listen to me. Listen to your lies?! No, no... no! I'm-I'm telling you the truth. I'm telling you the truth. I-I've stopped helping... the king... all for you. You should've hated me years ago for taking Grandfather's side... but you didn't give up on me. After all these years, you've never stopped loving me. In your mind, I've always been your son. (forcing): You don't know what that means to me. (trembling): And... W-Wendy... I know you didn't trust me at first, but... y-you forgave me. I f-f-feel like I'm a part of this family. Oh, please, we've heard this all before, Joanna. (panting): Please. We need to go... take care of Tarkoff, so we can get Tommy. Okay. We'll deal with you later. We're gonna lock your ass in. (footsteps departing) 
 
 (convulsing) DASH: Okay, so, can you make out any of it? INGRID: A little. Okay, great. I mean, this, this is, this is great, right? I mean, if these spells are so powerful... No! Dash, this is terrible. These spells are dark... and dangerous and they are to be avoided at all costs. There's an old saying: "Words written in blood draw only blood." The evil intention of a spell is hardwired into it. These spells will stain your soul. It's evil. Come to think of it, so is he. Okay, but I don't get it, how is this even possible that you knew him? I mean... how old are you? Okay, that is a verry  rude question. Besides... this wasn't me; not exactly. See, Freya and I have been reborn over and over again for centuries, but we don't remember any of our past lives. You're talking about reincarnation? Not exactly. Our mother is cursed... she never dies... she just keeps (scoffs) giving birth to us again and again. I think my head just exploded. I recently did a spell... (sighs) ...and discovered that in one of my past lives... I was involved with your grandfather. I'm sorry. Di... did you just say my grandfather? Archibald Browning was your grandfather. Your mother was his daughter. How-how is that even possible? I mean, that would make... that would make my mom over a hundred years old. Witches can live a very long time. And we don't age the same as regular people. No, no, no. I can't believe this. So-so you, you were sleeping with my grandfather? Yes. But when I met him, your mother was already ten years old. So there's no way... Oh, good. That's great. I'm so relieved to know I didn't have s*x with my own grandmother last night. Dash, I told you this was a different version of me anyway. That doesn't make it better! I'm sorry. I loved Archibald. But he led me down a very dark path. And it ended up costing me my life. What do you mean a dark path? Oh, my God. Dash... We killed a man and covered it up. Wait, you-you and Archibald? Yes. I didn't even see this before. You and I did the same thing. The patterns, they're repeating. Slow down. Yes! It's just like Freya and her past lives! What's happening with us, it's like me and Archibald... Ingrid! You're missing one huge difference! You said Archibald was evil. Okay? I'm not. I want to believe you, Dash. I really do. But if that's the truth, you have to prove it. Okay. Okay, great. How? Okay, we have to break the pattern. We have to make sure you do not turn out like your grandfather. Dash, you have to burn these journals. And forget these spells ever existed. Hey. You break into my apartment? Yes. But it was for a good reason. I told you last night, Freya, there... Killian, listen to me. This isn't about my feelings for you. We don't have to be together if you don't want to. That's fine. But I'm worried about you. I think Eva's done something to you. I think she's messing with your mind. Freya? This is sad. I know. I know I sound insane even to myself. But I also know that I'm right. I don't know what she's really up to. But I know she's trying to hide the truth from you. And what truth is that? That you still love me. Do you see this? I found this in your apartment. So? This is a powerful potion named Demon's Breath. You have vials of potions, too. Does that mean you're up to something? Demon's Breath is an alchemist's elixir used for mind control spells. Eva is not controlling my mind. If you are under a spell, of course you're not gonna believe me. Okay, wait. So, if I think you're being paranoid, that just proves you're right about Eva? I am talking to Eva either way. There's no way I'm gonna let you talk to her alone. I don't trust you around my wife. What the hell is wrong with you?! (grunting) It should've worked by now. Good luck in the afterlife. (gasping) What is happening to me?! I was right. You are the one. You're doing the right thing, Dash. Look. I want to put all these terrible things behind me. I wa... I want to move on. That's good. Dash, I'm glad. But don't do it for me. Why not? Huh? I am here to help you. But you are not gonna be able to move on until you fix things. Everything. Okay, how? Start by telling Killian the truth. I'm not sure that's such a great idea. You have to be completely honest with him. And you're saying if I do that... there's still a chance for us? No. That's not what I'm saying at all. Dash, if you do that, there's a chance for you. Because if you don't, this is going to haunt you for the rest of your life. Eva? Please, don't come any closer. What's wrong, mi amor? Where's abuela? She's dead. I said don't come any closer. Eva, what happened? I've been lying to you. From the beginning. I thought you were the answer to my prayers. A warlock. Brought to me across a beautiful ocean. I don't understand. I was born a mortal woman. Centuries ago. Until I met a warlock who offered me powers and eternal life. All I had to do was pledge myself to him. And in return, he made me a witch. Nine months later I was pregnant with my first child. The child of a warlock. As long as I got pregnant with the child of a warlock before my previous child died, I would remain powerful and young. That's why I summoned you to Santo Domingo. I felt you... adrift in the ocean. So I used my powers to bring you close. And I spelled you so you would fall in love with me. I needed you, mi amor,  so that I could live. Alma wasn't my grandmother. She was my daughter. I needed to be pregnant before she died. But I didn't make it. And now that she's dead, the spell is broken. (gasps) KILLIAN: Freya, please! Save her! Do something! (sighs) Okay. Okay. Um... repeat after me, okay? Vitae eius. Vitae eius. BOTH (chanting): Vitae eius. Vitae eius. Vitae eius. Vitae eius. Vitae eius. It's not working! Killian, I'm so sorry. I don't know what else to do. I'm sorry, Eva. EVA: I really did love you, mi amor. ♪ ♪ (Wendy gasping) This is Tommy's shirt! Where the hell is he?! I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch Tarkoff! Wendy? Tommy may still be alive. I'm gonna kill him either way. Okay, so we just lost our opportunity to take him by surprise. I think we need to try a more direct approach. You're just gonna call him? TARKOFF: Joanna, what a pleasant surprise. Save it. Frederick told me everything. Uh, somehow I doubt he told you everything. I need to see you. Now. You know I'm always happy to see you. But I'm a little busy at the moment. I could kill you easily. We both know that. I know your weak spots. I'm stronger than you. Are threatening me? That's adorable. I don't want to kill you. I don't do that anymore. Not unless I have to. Yeah, finally you're tempting me, Tarkoff. Or if you'd like to negotiate a peace, you're gonna have to meet with me. Neutral ground. Name the place. What am I gonna do? I don't know. We'll... We'll ask my family what to do with her remains. They'll help us figure it out. I should be angry, but instead I'm just so... I know. It's confusing. The spell she had you under was strong. And it's gonna take some time for it to wear off. I'm so sorry. You have nothing to be sorry about. I called you crazy and the other night at the bar... It's okay. It's not your fault. (cell phone ringing) I'm sorry. Ingrid? Freya, I need you to come over to the library right now! Are you okay? No. Just hurry, please! I just closed up and there's this scary guy outside that looks dangerous. I'm on my way. TARKOFF (as Ingrid): I'm really, really scared. (gasps) Oh, my God. Ingrid! Oh, my God. Ingrid, are you okay? What happened?! Ingrid...! Wake up! (panting): Oh, my God. (door locks) (flames crackling) And then she just died right there in my arms. I thought I loved her. I can't even trust my own mind. Everything I've been living the past few weeks, everything I've been feeling, has been a lie. I am so sorry. I don't know what's real anymore. I don't know who I can trust. You can trust me. Thanks. Y-Yeah. (sniffs) Um... maybe, uh... (sniffs) ...because... you're the only family I've got... (sighs) I need to come clean about something. Something I'm ashamed of and... something I'll regret for the rest of my life, but I need to tell you the truth. About what? It has to do with the night of my wedding. (grunts) I came to see you... on the dock. (door slams shut) I don't see him. There. Where the hell is Tommy? Wendy... pleasant as ever. I never liked you, now I hate you, so tell me where he is before I kick your ass. Why can't you be more like your sister? So... lovely... so elegant? JOANNA: Just answer her. Where's Tommy? Don't worry, he's alive. The vessel is safe. (flames crackling) Oh... you will? Well, then I'll kill you even faster. You know, I can read your mind. Pussy cat... JOANNA: We're not here to kill you. But we can't let you bring back the king. It's too late... it will happen. Do you were on our side once? (laughs): No... I swore an oath... just... like Frederick. I joined the rebellion as a spy. I will serve the king...  to my death. But I will serve you, too. I've watched you, Joanna... for hundreds of years; I've watched and I've read your mind from afar. I've known your pain... your passion and your secrets. I know you better than you could ever imagine. I've heard so many of your thoughts. Yeah? Can you hear what I'm thinking now? Yes, of course. And it does nothing to dissuade me. I still love you. You're angry now, but you'll get over it. I'm very patient... I've waited... so long for the day when you father would finally return and I would claim my reward. The king promised me, if I helped him, you would be mine. I'm not your reward. You'll come around in time. And we will return to our home... together. Yeah... that's not gonna happen. JOANNA: If you really knew me, Tarkoff, then you would know that no one can control me. Least of all, you. I have no wish to control you, I just want to serve you, my love. Yeah... that's not gonna happen. Expergo! Okay. Look, I get it. I get it, it's a lot to take in. But can you at least say something? You tried to kill me. Killian, try to understand: Freya... had just left me for you. I was out of my mind, man. I wa... I was so upset and angry and... Look, I didn't know about my powers. Okay, I-I didn't know what I was capable of. No. No. No. Attacking me, that's one thing. But you left me there on the boat. Pushed me out to sea to let me die. I panicked. You "panicked"? You "panicked"?! Don't touch me! I'm sorry. I guess I just... "panicked." I suppose I had that coming, but you need to calm down. Why? Because we shouldn't fight? Because we're family? Because I can trust... you? You don't want to do this. Yeah, I do. I think we both do; I think we've wanted this our whole lives. Since the day I was born  you've wanted me out of the way. You're wrong. Really? Freya didn't even know you had a brother till I showed up. You know, I didn't live up to the Gardiner name, so you pretended I didn't exist. You didn't want to be a part of this family! You ran away! I only ran away, 'cause you pushed me out the door! Next time you try to kill me... (grunts) ...make sure I'm dead. Gladly. (grunts) (both grunting) (grunting continues) (grunting) (grunts) (grunts) (groans) (screams) TARKOFF (shouting): Frederick...! We finally found the vessel...! It's time to prepare for the king's arrival. I'm sure your grandfather's willing to let bygones be bygones. You're not still mad, because I beat the living sh1t out of you, are you? (Frederick grunting) Oh, dear. (gasps) Looks like the only way to beat a telepath is with the element of surprise. (panting) (grunts) (groans) (gagging) (gurgling, grunts) I will never... let you or my grandfather hurt my family again. I will kill the host... and then I will kill myself. The king will  never...  come to this world. Never. (grunts) Never. (trembles, grunts) (gasps) (grunts) (choking) I left you... a present... (trembling) in the garden. (debris clinking) (gasps) Where's Frederick? The scorpion venom must have worn off. He can't have gone far. We locked him in. (shoes shuffling on floor) What happened? The garden. I'm so sorry. (silence)
