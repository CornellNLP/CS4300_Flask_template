 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 Victor! 
 It's really you. 
 Who is this? 
 He's your father. 
 I know where the door to Asgard is. 
 There was only one key and it was destroyed. 
 "A parching imbued"  is the other key. You're the other key. 
 This is the problem. 
 The Trickster and the Emperor. 
 One man is your soul mate. The other man's your destroyer. 
 Where's that piece from? I know I've heard it somewhere. 
 I don't see how... I wrote it. 
 I'm in love with you. 
 I'm marrying Dash tomorrow. 
 You dreamt about me before you met me. I dreamt about you, too. 
 I didn't even think you existed until I met you at that engagement party. 
 You marry him, it'll destroy you. 
 I love you... 
 I loved you even before I met you. 
 You marry him, it'll destroy you. 
 I've made my choice. 
 Freya, listen to me. 
 Is everything okay, Freya? 
 Killian was just leaving. 
 Good-bye. 
 (crickets trilling) 
 (meows) 
 How is it possible that I'm the key? 
 Uh, I don't know how and I don't know why, but I know I'm right. 
 You are "a parching imbued." 
 We can prove it. By opening the door. 
 I can't help you, Mike. 
 Yes, you can. 
 Okay, fine, I won't. 
 I'll show you my research. You'll see that I'm right. 
 I don't care if you're right. 
 Aren't you curious about who you are? And where you came from? 
 Let's go to the portal. 
 Let's see if you can open it. We can make history. 
 (meows) 
 So, what did you find? 
 You know how we cleared the portal of the  ramus mortium? 
 Why? Is it back? 
 Nope, it's worse. Now there's argenteum leaking out. 
 All on its own? 
 Yeah. 
 That means someone's trying to create a rift between the two worlds. 
 So you think that the shifter's trying to open the portal? 
 Definitely. 
 Hang on a second... what if it's not just about opening the portal? 
 What if it's about creating the rift in order to obtain the argenteum? 
 That is one of the few poisons that would actually kill you. 
 Has it occurred to either of you that the portal is under the house where Freya's getting married tomorrow? 
 Well, it has come up, yeah. 
 So, what if the Gardiners are the ones that are after you? 
 No, we actually tested both Penelope and Dash. They both came back mortal. 
 Okay, so what are we gonna do? 
 I'm sorry, "we"? 
 Yeah, I'm not gonna let you face this alone. 
 You know, frankly I'm glad you're both here. 
 I could use the help. 
 (crickets trilling) 
 Tenebris. 
 Magicae. 
 Infirmarent. 
 Hostem! (crows cawing) Season 1, Episode 10 "Oh, What a World!" ♪ Oh, Freya. You look so... Do you like the veil? It's gorgeous. You look gorgeous and a bit... (laughing): Mom? Just don't cry. Save it for the wedding. Or at least the wedding dress. I'm sorry. (fabric tears) Oh, no! Isn't that bad luck? Life is not about good luck or bad luck. It is about what you do with what you're given. So... Not to worry. Okay. (thunder crashes) Did you see? It's raining. So? Rain's good luck for a wedding. No, it's not! That's just something mortals say to make themselves feel better. We both know it's an omen. It's weather, Wendy. It happens. What are you doing? Nothing. Freya's veil ripped. What? Are you kidding me? Another sign? It's a sign she has a clumsy mother. (crow caws) (thud) (thunder crashes) What the hell...? (gasps) Three harbingers of doom, Joanna? You can't say this is a coincidence. Okay, Wendy, you're right. It's not. The shifter's sending dark energy to weaken us. That's why the veil ripped. That's where the rain came from. And that's why the dead crow. All part of the same spell. We have to cancel the wedding. I cannot do that to my daughter. Every life that Freya has lived has been cut short. She's never been married, she's never had a child, never grown old. I have to give her this day. She's waited too long for it. I want to give her this day, too. But I want you to be safe. We can do both. We have to meet the darkness with light. So, every omen that comes our way, we counteract with an equal and opposite spell. We can fix this. We have to fix this for Freya. Apere. (lock opens) ♪ ♪ (gasps) What the hell do you think you're doing? How'd you get in my room? Give me back my maps. I can't. You wouldn't even know about the portal if it weren't for me. You owe me, Ingrid. I don't owe you a thing. You don't care about me. You're doing this for yourself. I don't care what you are. I'm not afraid of you. You're not gonna hurt me. You're too sweet. I will do whatever it takes to open that door. Mike, you've lost it. You've turned into your father. My father was right! And so am I. And I'm not gonna stop until I prove it. Corpus dolet! (grunts) What are you doing to me? (grunts) Manete. I'm not as sweet as you think I am. And if I were you, I'd get the hell out of town. You shouldn't mess with me, Mike. I'm a witch. Remember? (grunts) It's my last day in this house. Somebody better eat breakfast with me. Oh, hey! Hey. I thought you were Mom. Or Ingrid... or Wendy. Man, I used to be able to sense who was entering a room without even looking. Now I'm all normal. Don't worry... powers or no powers, I don't think you'll ever be  normal . Thank you. Wait, are you leaving? I should get back to the city. Look, it was... So nice to meet you, Freya. Again, I... I thought you were coming to the wedding. Yeah, I don't want to... I don't want to impose. Who else is gonna walk me down the aisle? Really? Well, yeah. I don't think it's an accident that you came back into my life when you did. I think this is supposed to be. My father is supposed to walk me down the aisle. Only if you want to. I would love to. If you're sure this wedding is what you really want. Yeah, I am. I just... Things are complicated. Yeah, I had a... I had a feeling. Did Mom tell you about the tarot? She dealt it for me, and I drew the Emperor and the Trickster. And last night you met the trickster. You sure about that? Yes, I am. Dash is the Emperor. He's my soul mate. He's loving and kind and selfless, and he... Makes me feel safe. And Killian, he... scares me a little. He's trouble. You always loved trouble. Yeah, well, I don't want it to destroy me. You can't read into the cards so literally. "Destroy"... "Destroy" can mean a lot of things. None of 'em are good, whether it's literal or a metaphor. You're right. I had to make a choice, and I did. I-I choose Dash. And there's no part of you that's tempted by Killian? Yeah. Of course. But that's what the Trickster does. He confuses people. INGRID: Hey. Oh. Hey, you're still here. Dad's walking me down the aisle. Oh. That makes sense. You've known him for five minutes, so why shouldn't he? I'm sorry, whose wedding is this? I just don't get it. VICTOR: You know what? I need to get back to the city, get my suit and a few other things. I'll be back later. Bye. Bye. I know you have made him out to be some monster in your head, but it's not true. He loves us. He sure has an odd way of showing it. I know this sounds nuts, but it's kind of nice to have someone else in the house who knows the truth about who we are. Who we can talk to about all the things we have to hide from the rest of the world. It means a lot to me that he's here for this. I think it's meant to be. Okay. If that's what you believe. I want you to have everything you want today. Thank you. What's with the blueprints? (laughs) Oh. Um, that... that's just some, uh, research for my dissertation. On the day of my wedding? I'm done now. (Laughs) And I love you. And I am so crazy happy for you. And I can't believe you're leaving me. I'm gonna be a mile away. (Laughs) I know. But it won't be the same. I will never leave you. I can't, we're too connected. (laughs) (footsteps approach) I meet you, darkness, with my light. Protecti sumus hodie lumen de tenebrae. Hey. Did you see...? The rain's cleared up. I noticed that. Was that you? No. Maybe. I just thought you should have sun on your big day. Thanks, Mom. Hey, I asked Victor to walk me down the aisle. You did? Yeah, is that crazy? Am I crazy? Ingrid thinks I'm crazy. I want you to make your own choices in life, to honor your  wisdom, and to follow what feels right to you. That's how I know I've done my job. And I want you to walk with me, too. It wouldn't feel right without you. I would be honored. Oh... I almost forgot. Oh, you got me a present. It was on the back steps. Killian left it. Is he still here? Uh, I didn't actually see him. How do you know it's from him? I did a little spell. Can't be too safe. (music box plays Killian's song) Oh, what a lovely song. You okay? (sniffs) I'm fine. WENDY: Okay. I've protected us 12 ways to Sunday. Ooh, sage. Good idea. I thought we should do a blessing before the wedding. Okay. Nice. So... You and Victor? There is no "Me and Victor." There's always been a "You and Victor." I can't go down that road again. Didn't you? Already? Last night? How... how did you know? (laughs) Cat ears. Excuse me. So... you still love him? That's never been the problem. I miss him. Roger... I got your text. What's up? Hey. (gasps) What are you doing?! We're not supposed to see other before the wedding! I'm sorry. I know you're superstitious, but I wanted to give you something. Okay. So you made Roger text me and tell me there's an emergency? That is so... Smart? Devious! Look, I knew you wouldn't come unless I tricked you, but I... I think you'll be happy when you see why. (gasps) I-I thought you could wear it today. It's-it's something new. And something blue. Dash, this is too much. This probably cost more than my car. It's just the beginning. Look, I-I want you to have the best of everything, Freya. That's what you deserve. I'm just so glad you're mine. You're back. Yeah, I travel fast. It's one of my gifts. Hey... can I talk to you about something? Yes. Of... of course, Ingrid. I... I was hoping we could talk. This is not a father-daughter conversation. Oh. Okay. What is it? I want to know about Asgard. I've asked Mom and Wendy 1,000 times, and they never give me a straight answer. Well, I'm not surprised you're curious. You're a lot like me. I don't think I'm anything like you. You're a scholar. So am I. You're tenacious. So am I. You're driven to seek answers and truth. So am I. We're the same. Okay. So, then... tell me the truth. What happened there? Why did we leave? There was a war, and we lost. If you could open the door and go back, would you? I'd be pretty scared to open that door. Because there are a lot of evil people on the other side. Yes. And they want to kill us. Yes. And they're far more powerful than we are, I'm sorry to say. But...? (sighs) None of us wanted to leave. And there are still those we left behind... And I'd do just about anything to see them again. (whistling Wagner's "Bridal Chorus") ♪ 
 
 Freya... I am so happy for you. You look incredible. I'm so glad I made it back into your life in time to see this, Freya. Oh, thanks, guys. So, I have my something new and blue. Whoa. INGRID: I'm blind! Beautiful. Dash gave it to me. I feel strange wearing it, though. I'm not used to so much luxury. I never thought I was so fancy. INGRID: Um, have you seen your engagement ring? I know. I just... I think it's really starting to hit me. In just a few hours, I'm gonna be married. I'm gonna live in this house... this gorgeous, incredible house... with a gorgeous, incredible man who buys me blinding diamonds and sapphires. Yeah, pretty sweet. I just don't really care about any of that. I just want to start a life with the man I love. You still need something old and borrowed. We've got that covered. Ow! (giggling) To remind myself that I'm making the right choice. Thanks, Mom. I love you. I love you so much. All right, well, I want to do a blessing for the wedding and for your marriage. May it be a long, and happy one. Benedicito. Benedicito. Benedicito. Benedicito. (gasps) Oh, no! Oh. I'll take these. Hello, ladies. It's okay. I can fix it. Oh, you look breathtaking, Freya. Oh, and your father was looking for you. He's in the music room. See you in there. Sage burning. (laughs) Ooh! Yeah! Okay, I'm not gonna say it. Then don't. A broken chain, another bad omen? It's okay. We fight the darkness with light. Please, just help me fix it. "We fight the darkness with light..." Hey. You look beautiful. Thank you. So, I know I might overstepping, and honestly I wasn't even sure if I should bring this up. And I know today is possibly the worst time to be telling you this, but ultimately, I believe, Freya, that you have the right to know. Know what? I want to show you something. What's this? Do you recognize any of this? It feels oddly familiar. Because it used to be yours. I know I said I hadn't seen you since your mother and I split up, but that's not exactly true. Our paths have crossed more than once throughout the centuries, Freya. But there was one time, one time in particular that I thought you should know about. Why? Because it might affect what you decide to do with the rest of your life. Penelope, why do you keep this picture here? What do you mean? Well, doesn't it give you the creeps? Not really. That man built this house. And I love this house. So I'm just paying my respects. Of course. Must be hard to pay respects to a murderous cult leader. And who did he murder exactly? I-I don't know, specifically. I just heard. That's funny, because I swear I read somewhere that  he  was the one that was murdered. Are you sure? I thought he disappeared, and no one knew exactly what became of him. Why don't we ask Ingrid what happened? Why? Because... She's a Fair Haven history buff. Right. Here's to our families... Finally coming together. In 1906, I was living in Los Angeles, and I tracked you down in San Francisco. You'd struck out on your own, which you do from time to time. It's that restless Bohemian in you.... Always longing for adventure... You were working in a tavern, and your drinks were a legend in the city. You were famous. Of course, you were secretly mixing magic cocktails, but no one actually knew that. They just knew that they couldn't get enough. You read fortunes on the side just for fun, but always for free. And you were happy, Freya. Truly happy. Maybe the happiest I've ever known you to be. You told me you were in love. I said, "That's nothing new." But I realized pretty quickly that this time, it was different. You'd finally found your other half. His name was Henry. He was a musician, and you were his muse. You lived in a tiny apartment above the bar, he wrote his music, and you made your drinks. And you were happy. Then you died in the great earthquake. Your funeral was the last time I saw Henry... until yesterday... When he was standing in the front hall of your house. Joanna, is everything okay? I think Penelope's the shifter. What?! Why would you say that? I asked her about Archibald Browning, and it was very strange. I saw this... flash for a moment. Of anger. Um, she's connected to him somehow. I can tell. Okay, let's go down to the portal. Just make sure nothing has changed. All right. Gotta do it fast. I should've listened to you, Wendy, about the signs. It wasn't enough to just counteract them. It didn't work. Wait... something's wrong. I can feel it. You're right. Something is very wrong. (chants a spell) How does that feel? Wrists too tight? Fuge ad parietem! That's cute. I like your spirit! But, you see, I've drawn a circle around this table. Red brick dust mixed with blackthorn and yarrow. You are contained. That was a nice try, though. Who are you? Why are you doing this? I'm Athena. But you died. Back in the early '60s, yeah. No, I wanted you to  think Athena had died, so you wouldn't know I was after you. But how did you find me? Oh, it wasn't easy. It took decades. Your shroud was very effective; I couldn't even find this place on the map... but I finally figured out a way to break through your spell. And now, here we are. It couldn't have been. How is that possible? Killian is mortal. There's a word in Sanskrit, "samsara". the cycle of death and rebirth. Wait, you mean like reincarnation? It's possible that you knew him even before San Francisco, that your souls met again and again, maybe even going back centuries. He might have chosen to be reborn now just so he could find you. Or maybe he's the Trickster! Disguising himself as someone I used to love, trying to destroy me, just like the Tarot card said. You're right, Freya. I don't know that it's really him. You said earlier that you don't think it was an accident that I came back into your life now. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's not an accident. Maybe I came back to tell you this. I don't know. It's not for me to say. I guess you have to look into your heart and decide. (instruments clatter) I didn't mean to kill him. You forget... I was there. Athena, please. I'm-I'm sorry. I know you loved Archibald, but you don't understand. You were a child. He was evil. He was my father! And I loved him, and you murdered him! So you sent Dash to spell Freya. Oh, no, he doesn't have powers. He's actually in love with her. I didn't plan that part. Very annoying. Then I realized it could be an advantage. Keep you all close. So Dash isn't really your son? Oh, he is. I just borrowed his powers when he was a baby. And Killian's, too. I haven't told them, but I will, soon enough. I needed to be stronger... Athena, please. So that I'd be able to find you and finally do what needed to be done! (Screams) Hey. It's almost time. Are you ready? Can you give me a minute? Okay. (Killian's song plays) ♪ Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you doing here?! I thought this was bad luck. Open your eyes. What-What's wrong? I can't do this. What do you mean? I can't marry you. No. No-no-no-no, Freya, you're just freaking out. I mean, you're having cold feet. It's normal. It's not cold feet. I love you, but I can't do this. I'm so confused. I mean, you wanted this just as much as I did. You're right, I did. I wanted this to be perfect. I wanted us to be perfect... So I pretended that we were. Because I had this idea that this is who I should be, but I don't actually think it's who I am. This is about Killian, isn't it? You're in love with him. It's about me. I trusted you, Freya. I gave you everything. Just get out. I am so sorry. Get out! I don't ever want to see you again. (guests conversing quietly) ♪ Have you seen Joanna? No. No, not for a while. Me neither. Keep an eye out. I'll check the garden. But thank you so much for coming. I'll see you inside. I'm gonna go check on my sister. (gasps) You may be a witch, but I will pull the trigger faster than you can do any magic. So don't even try. Shall we go? Where? I think you know exactly where. PENELOPE: The argenteum has taken its toll. Now you can be killed like the rest of us. Don't worry about Ingrid and Freya. They're a part of my family now. I will help them grieve this senseless loss. (panting) PENELOPE: How's it feel? WENDY: Joanna! Oh, look. It's the kitty. (grunting) I'm sorry it had to come to this. I didn't think I'd have to convince you. I thought you'd be more excited. But I'm going through to the other side. This is it. Get in there! You really think you could hurt me? All it would take is for me to do one... (groans) Keep your hands down, or I will shoot you again. I know you can be killed. (breathing hard) Okay. You're the key. Open it up. I don't know how. So improvise! Ow! Ow... I don't know if you've figured it out yet, but I have the power here. You do what  I  say! No! Get over there! (sobs) Nothing's happening. Then concentrate. I don't know what I should do. (rumbling) You're doing it already. (grunting) Penelope... Ah. Leave my sister alone. (grunts) You are stronger than I thought. But I still got the poison inside you and you don't have a chance. You are going to die. (grunts) Fight the darkness with the light. (screams) ♪ (screaming) ♪ ♪ (engine starts) Oh... Yes! (laughs) Ugh. I think she's dead. I'd say so. I knew it, I knew it. I knew you were the key. Use your other hand. Put your other hand on the wall! Touch the wall. (rumbling loudly) DASH: Killian! What are you doing? (grunts) What the hell...? (grunts) ♪ Why? It was payback for killing Archibald. She was his daughter. What? Penelope was Athena? So Dash and Killian...? Apparently, they didn't know. (groans) Joanna... Did she poison you with argenteum? Yeah. I might not have long left. Oh, my God. Come here. (rumbling) What the hell was that? The portal. Oh... ♪ Killian! Killian... ♪ ♪ (rumbling) Ha! (laughing) Ingrid, no! (screams) ♪
