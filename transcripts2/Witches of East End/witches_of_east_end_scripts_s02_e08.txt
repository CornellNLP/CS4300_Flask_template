 Previously on Witches of East End. 
 Forach Deyna! I don't usually dance with my friends like this, Dash. But we're not just friends, are we? You're not gonna get rid of me that easy. Tommy, I almost killed you tonight. Dash, stop! We have to talk about my son, Kyle. Ad mortem, te... Killian: This Eva person, I think she has you under some sort of spell. She's using you, man. She's trying to control you. You don't love her! I don't want to hurt you, Frederick. I'm here to help you complete your mission. We're going to work together... to bring back the king. Tarkoff: What are you waiting for? This is the third one we've tried, and none of them worked. (muffled screaming) (muffled screaming) Deeper. You have to cut deeper. The venom has to travel through his bloodstream into his heart. (muffled entreating) Gaja ert. Eg migfa ro pín koma fram kona gleun gadi. It was a lot easier when then Mandragora was doing the dirty work, wasn't it. It's working. Let's just hope we have a match. Wait... what's happening? It didn't work. We have to find another way. We can't keep killing random people. Might be the problem... they're random. They don't know us, and they're scared. Of course they are. Their souls are hanging on for dear life. Maybe we need someone who feels safe and secure enough to let go. How do we do that? We have to find someone... who trusts you. There's my birthday girl! I made you pancakes. Chocolate chip! Your favorite. Thanks, mom. Actually, don't eat too much because... there's gonna be a massive spread at the party later. Oh, Mom. I already told you... I don't want a birthday party. This is your first-ever 30th birthday. That is a cause for celebration. Do you remember Freya's birthday in 1875? Wendy! Don't be morbid. What happened in 1875? You were impaled. What did I just say? I'm not saying it's gonna happen again. But you are saying this day could be worse. Freya, what's wrong? I know this is a big deal for you and Wendy, but all I can see is that I'm 
30, still living with my mother and working at a bar. And I just ran away from my wedding to be with a man who's married to someone else. Sweetie, you're just going through a rough patch. This is more than a rough patch. I've lost my soul mate. That's a the love I'm going to get in this life. Aw, honey, I have known you a very long time, and the one thing that you never lack for is love. Ugh, it's hot! I'm going to the garden. Ugh, you can't end every discussion by turning into a cat! Morning, Frederick. Hey, Mom. Freya, I'm so sorry... I don't think I can make your birthday party. Oh, it's okay. What? Yeah, I'm just exhausted. This is important. It's your party, too. You and Freya are twins. (sighs) It's not my birthday. We were born as twins, but she's been reborn a lot since then. We have different birthdays now. That's a technicality. I haven't gotten to celebrate your birthday in four centuries. (sighs) Joanna: Well? I'll be there. (tapping on window, door opens) Hi. Hey. Ingrid, what are you doing here? I'm here to say I'm sorry. I got your text asking me to brunch. But after the gala, I started feeling weird about the whole Freya thing, so I put off responding. And then I felt like it was too late to respond. So, I figured I'd stop by and say I did get your text, and I would actually love to do brunch sometime. Oh. That... that's so thoughtful. Dash, your toast is burning. Hey. Ingrid, I... No explanation necessary. Sorry about your toast. Mmm. So good! I just can't eat any more. But you eat almost nothing. You're big, strong man. You must eat, or you waste away. Eat, eat! Gracias, abuela. He's full. You're killing me, Alma. _ You're so good with my grandmother. She adores you. Got to go to work. Roger called. Bartending a private party. Whose party? Freya's. See you later. - Adios, Alma! Adios. _ He loves her. _ _ He's built up a tolerance. Every day I have to make a potion stronger, but his feelings for her are starting to break through. I'm still not pregnant. _ _ (meows) (sighs) Oh, my God. (gasps) Tommy? What are you doing here? Your niece let me in. I came to surprise you. Surprise! This isn't happening. Okay, wait. This can't be happen... Okay, let's just... let's just stay calm. No, I don't want to stay calm, I... I want to know what the hell just happened. Hey, that... is not what it seemed like. Oh. Good... because it seemed like you were a cat. And now you're a human. Okay, it, this may sound crazy, just... just roll with me for a second, okay? I'm a witch. Oh. You're a witch. Yes. Are you gonna drop a house on me? No! I'm a good witch. You know, one of the... one of the pretty ones! (Laughs) (tries to laugh) I'm sorry, Tommy. I didn't want you to find out this way. I would have told you, but we have this code... "We"?! There's more of you? Well, yeah. I mean, there's a few. W... we're out there. We're hiding in plain sight. But... I won't hurt you. I don't know what you're gonna do. Tommy. I... I... I should go. sh1t! Hi, this is Ingrid. Sorry I missed your call, but leave a message and I'll call you back. Ingrid. Hey, it's me. Hey, it's me. Look, what you saw to... That girl meant nothing to me. Okay? And, Ingrid, when you left I... I started thinking about what it would be like if you never came back. Look, I know I made a lot of mistakes recently, but I... I don't want to ruin this, too. So, please just give me a call back. Is that what you're wearing? We've got to head over there. I'm not going... I'm freaking out. What's going on? Tommy saw me shift. He what? How?! Yes. I didn't see him. He was waiting for me in the kitchen. Wendy, this is bad. Very bad. Gee, ya think? JOANNA: So, what did you tell him? The truth... what choice did I have? Oh, sh1t. I'm sorry, Wendy. I know you liked him. But maybe there's a way... You didn't know what I was gonna say. That you just wanted to pretend that this didn't happen, and keep seeing him. Why can't I? Because you can't. You know what you have to do. No, I am not doing a memory spell on him. You don't have a choice. He can't know what you really are. Why not? Ugh. You know why not. (sighing): Oh... Who cares about the code? What's the big deal anyway? So, a mortal knows that we exist. The "big deal" is the persecution we face every time they discover what we are. We get burned at the stake, we get drowned, we get hunted down like animals. They will always try to destroy us. Tommy would never do that. Then he's in danger, too. Any witch who discovers he knows the truth will kill him. You... you've got to spell him to forget. You are such a hypocrite. You were totally against it when I erased Maura Thatcher's memory. Tommy will be safer if you spell him, rather than let him know our secret. But it'll never be safe enough, Joanna. He has a daughter. What if he loses his mind like Maura did? Oh, I know... it's awful. And we can do everything we can to prevent that from happening, but you can't see him after. We can't risk anything triggering his memory. Your relationship with him has to be over. I know. So sorry, Wendy. I just... I... I can't see any other choice. It's just... he was one of the... good ones. I know. That's why we're gonna protect him. You know, if we leave right now, it still counts that I came to my own party. It hasn't even started yet. This is gonna be fun, I promise. Oh, kill me now. (cell phone dings) (sighs) What are you doing here? Working. Guy's got to make a living. Fine. Then earn your keep. Make me a drink. Something strong. What can you make that lights on fire? I know just the thing. So... Happy birthday. Thanks. You look really beautiful. I mean, you... Always do, it's just... You look especially beautiful... Tonight. Thanks. What are you doing? Ah, trying to read your mind. It's one of my gifts. Really? And...? I'm not so good with witches. Just bits and pieces. (quiet laugh) You don't look happy though. You okay? Yeah. I'm great. It's my birthday. (Whoops) I'm aging. (Laughs) So, what are you making me? You'll see. Allow the artist his time, will you? (laughs) Looks like the artist is getting better. A few tricks. Hard to bust out at parties. I know. I hate that. Not being able to show the world what you can do. At least I can show you. Careful, it's hot. I think I can handle it. Can I have my drink, please? You look terrible. You get enough sleep? We need to talk. Wow. That sounds serious. I can't do it tonight. In fact... Afferrentur dolor. Oh, God! I'm sorry. I can't hear you. What was that? If we keep killing people like this, eventually we're gonna get caught. Remora. So... (coughing) What do you suggest? (gasping) I suggest you rot in hell. Oh! Happy birthday! Thanks, guys. WOMAN: Thank you. What are you doing? Nothing. What did you do? Nothing. Okay, fine. I think Killian is flirting with me a little. A lot. Definitely. He's definitely flirting with me. He's married. I know. And you're over him. I know. Okay. He's probably just being nice to me because it's my birthday. _ Who's that? Barb. She's really sorry she can't make it tonight. But she's still on bed rest. Hmm. Tell Barb I said hi. Cheers. Happy birthday. Can I get a shot of something? Sure. Yeah. What do you want? Doesn't matter. Tequila, whatever. You got it. Happy birthday. You're Freya's twin, right? Can I just get the drink? You have a problem with me? You really don't remember, do you? Remember what? I remember. know exactly what you did back in Asgard. All right. What are you talking about? I don't know you, man. You knew me a very long time ago. You may not remember, but I do. Look, I don't know what this is about. But you got wrong guy. Just stay away from my sister if you know what's good for you. Whoa! Tommy? Can I talk to you? Yeah. You're here. I'm sorry I ran out the other day. I'm sorry that I... I really am. You're freaked. It's standard. (laughs) I'm... a little... overwhelmed. God, you must hate me. No. No, no. I don't. I think you're actually a great person. If... if you're, in fact, a person. Oh, I'm a person. I'm just other things, too. You're a witch. FREYA: 30! Oh, my God! (all laughing) It only happens twice. (indistinct chatter) Hey. Can I talk to you in the storeroom? I can't, um, find the olives. They're on the shelf right where they always are. Yeah. I really need your help, please? Okay. I'll see you guys. (laughs) 
 
 What's going on? Can we talk? You brought me in here to talk. Looks like we're talking. Okay, uh, this is gonna... seem a little out of the blue, but seeing you tonight, I suddenly feel like everything is so clear. Okay. (Short laugh) Uh, I woke up today... married. And I don't know how it happened. I assume there were vows. And probably some cake. This is serious. Look, I'm still in love with you. Why are you doing this? I wish I could forget about you and move on, but I can't. You did move on. You got married. I'm telling you I'm not in love with her. Yes, you are. I have read your aura. I thought I was. But I'm not. Every morning, the first thing I think about when I wake up is you. I dream about you every night. I've been trying to ignore it because of Eva, but It's just getting stronger. And I can't live a lie anymore. I have no idea why I married her. Maybe it's because I just found out what I really was. She helped guide me through it. I don't know. Wait, what do you mean? She's a witch, too. She's a witch? She helped me so much. She saved my life. And she's a good person, but that is not enough. I don't... love her. I don't. I think maybe I went temporarily insane or something. I think you're still insane. How are you saying this to me right now?! On my birthday, by the way. I know it sounds, nuts. Okay? I do. Yeah. But this is the most sane I have felt in months. It is so clear to me we belong together. It doesn't matter if we belong together. We've tried to be together in other lives. And every time we get involved, you die or I die or we both die. We are literally star-crossed. It doesn't matter what we want. Wait, what are you talking about? Even if you weren't married, we could never ever be together. Freya? Don't follow me! Happy birthday. Hey. Thanks. Hope you like it. I had to go to, like, five stores to find it and then finally they just ordered it special. Thank you. What, uh, what is it? It's aquavit. Since your mom said you spent so much in Denmark and my friends told me... Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah, I... I drank a ton of this. Thank you. You don't like it. I do. I love it. Hello, Frederick. I didn't expect to see you here. And I suspect the feeling is mutual. Caroline, um, could you, could you give me a minute, please? I... I... I just... He needs to talk to me, darling. So, let's review. I can't cut the king spirit out of your chest. And you can't kill me. Does that about cover it? But I did kill you. I told you, I'm a telepath. I can read your thoughts. I think I can defend against a little knife to the heart. But how? How... how...? I... am far more powerful than you think. And that is something you should never ever forget. Now, if you're through playing games, it's time to get back to work. I think we were looking for someone who trusted you. I have an idea. Wait! Wait! (quiet laugh) We're done. Yeah, you can go back and talk to him if you like. Can I get you a drink? We haven't really had much time to catch up. Is that your game? Swooping in on helpless widows? You are many things, Joanna. But, helpless has never been one of them. (laughs) Drink sounds lovely. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. Uh... Do you want to get out of here? I think this party's winding down. We can... open this at home and share a glass. Then I can give you your other birthday gift. Okay. (phone dings) _ Dash. What are you doing here? Well, you're... you're not returning my calls or my texts. I've... been going a little crazy. This is Freya's birthday party. Yeah. I know. But I had to apologize in person. Ingrid, I am so sorry. I didn't think I had a chance with you. What, you wanted a chance? Why do you think I'm here? Look, Ingrid, I am in awe of you. I mean, you're powerful and every bit of that power goes towards helping people. Why wouldn't I want to be around someone like that? Listen... (sighs) Ingrid, what you saw this morning... I don't know why I did that. I've been a little messed up lately, and the only thing that's been holding me together is you. When I'm with you, I... I feel... I feel good. I want to give this a try. So... Will you give me a chance? Please? Freya? What are you doing here? I was worried about you. (sighs) Could you please go worry about someone else? You're the one I worry about. I can't help it. You can't tell me we've been together in other lives, that we keep dying, and then just walk away. I am cursed, Killian. And my curse is I die young. And then I'm reborn, over and over again. But I always die young. My mom gets pregnant right away, and... it just starts right over. Whoa. And in almost every life I've had, I've met you. You always have different names, different identities, but it always ends in tragedy. So I was right. We are connected. You are my soul mate. And I love you. But it doesn't matter, because we can never be together. (sighs) You've never said that before. What? That you love me. It's true. Screw fate. I'm sorry. Killian. All right. Show me what you got, Glinda. Ostium clausum. Wow. That was amazing. Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet. Creare litus. (waves crashing) Huh. Wow... where are we? Bali. I always wanted to go there. We're in Bali? As Bali as you can get in the Bent Elbow storeroom. It's beautiful. It's an illusion. It's temporary. But it ain't half bad. Well, maybe we can go there for real someday. ♪ ♪ (panting) (moaning) Happy birthday. (laughs) Oh, that was... What's wrong? I just don't want to lose you again. (sighs) This whole star-crossed thing... I don't... I don't buy it. You're a witch, I'm a warlock. Maybe we're both magic in this lifetime for a reason. Whatever fate throws at us... we can take it. No, we can't. That's the whole point of fate. We're at its mercy. Bullshit. If the stars are crossed, we'll... we'll change 'em. We'll find a way. We belong together. You said it yourself. So, let's take our own destiny together. What about Eva? I should talk to her. I want to start this off on the right foot. Mm. And then what? Meet me at the Bent Elbow at midnight. We'll start our life together tonight. We'll take a trip wherever you want. Pack a bag. Anywhere but Santo Domingo. (both laugh) Cheers. Cheers. It was delicious. I miss this. (coughing) It's not quite what I was expecting. You... you got to finish it, though. (ice clinking) I threw this whole party, and no one even stayed for cake. Well, your children are grown up. They can fend for themselves, live their own lives. Lot of people would envy you. Yeah? Yeah, me, for one. Children, marriage... I never did that. Well, you could have if you wanted to. Come on, with who? A mortal? And another and another. (Scoffs) Well, there's plenty of us here. There must have been some witch that you fell for over the years. There was one. Who? You. Me? Oh. (Laughs) Yeah, come on. You knew. You... you had a... you had a crush... a long time ago. (laughs) It was more than a crush. It was first love. And that stays with you. For centuries? Yeah. I knew the moment that I met you. But you were the daughter of the king. I was just a lowly guardsman, and... I was too loyal to ever dream about making a move on you. But the fact that you were even willing to be my friend... that felt like enough somehow. And I was glad that you found love with Victor. Even though I wished it were me. I've never been easy to live with. (laughs) I think you dodged a bullet there. (laughter) I doubt Victor would have said that. You two always seemed happy. We were. When you add it all up, we were. Yeah. I can't believe I didn't get to say good-bye. You know, I did, and... it still doesn't seem real. It still hasn't hit me that he's gone, and that, this time, he's not coming back. Life just keeps going on and on and on, and... nobody talks about him, because they don't know him like I... like I did. I knew him. I know. I know. As long as we're still here, so is he. To Victor. (quietly): Come here. (sighs) How are you feeling? (Chuckling) Great. Better than great. Yeah? Mm-hmm. (both chuckle) (groans) Ingrid... (sighs) look, there's something I need to tell you. I... I probably should have told you sooner, but... (gasps) Freya. Huh? I need to call her. I never told anyone I was leaving her party. I feel terrible. My phone's dead. Well, use mine. Yeah, that's what Freya wants for her birthday, me calling from your phone in your bed. I'll just send her an e-mail. What is this? Ingrid, wait, no, don't look at that. What the hell is this, Dash? What did you do? Give me that. Kyle Hutton was blackmailing you. The man you killed, the body we dumped in the ocean, that wasn't an accident, was it? No, no, it was. I swear it was an accident. You murdered him! And I helped you cover it up. Ingrid, he was gonna shoot you. This was before I knew how to control my powers. And William Hutton? His father. You killed him, too, didn't you? What happened? Did he figure it out? So you killed him, in front of everyone, and then pretended to try to save him. It's not that simple. And Killian? Does he know you left him to die like that? Killian is alive. I didn't leave him to anything. I trusted you. I helped you. Ingrid, do you know how many lives I've been able to save since I learned how to use my powers? More than over the whole rest of my career. I can lay my hands on a patient and heal them. It's one death or two versus saving hundreds. Maybe thousands. You're murdering people. Not everything is black and white or easy. I'm... Stay away from me. You mean something to me. This... means something to me. You mean nothing to me. (groans) Hey. How's your grandmother? She's fine. I gave her our bed. Is everything okay? We need to talk. (sighs) I am worn out. (chuckles) Turns out... you are a bad witch after all. (chuckles) I'm glad you came back. Yeah, I'm glad I did. I had a really good night with you. So... now you can tell me what's going on. What? You've been looking at me all night with those sad puppy dog eyes. Oh, please. I have cat eyes, thank you very much. (sighs) I did not look like that. Well... I'm just... I'm supposed to... We can't see each other anymore. What do you mean? I'm supposed to spell you, but I can't do it. I won't... do it. So please just swear on an oath that you'll forget about me, and we'll never speak again. That's the only way that you'll be safe. What are you talking about? (sniffles) Just... There's so much about my world you don't understand. Then explain it to me. I can't. There's a code. I don't want this thing to end between us, but... I can't put you in danger. Look, shouldn't that be up to me to decide? You'd be putting your life at risk. So what? I've done it before. (sighs) In the Army, we have a code, too. "I will never accept defeat, and I will never leave a comrade behind." Look at me. I'm not gonna leave you. I like your code. (laughing) That drink was strong. I didn't think that it would be that strong. Close your eyes. (exhales) That too tight? No. Do you trust me? (moaning) (coughs) I should take you to the hospital. No, no. It does not matter. I go, I don't go. I'm dying. Don't say that. But I will stay as long as I can. Until I know you have his child inside you. Shh... (sniffles) You should be worrying  about. But I... I don't want you to die, too. I love you, Mama. I love you, too, baby girl. You're gonna be okay. Your mama's got you. Your mama's got you. (door opens) (door shuts) Hey. Finally. I was getting worried. No, I'm sorry. I can't do this. What? I wanted to tell you in person. Tonight was a mistake. I don't know what came over me, but Eva's my wife. I love her. I... I can't leave her. I'm sorry. I don't understand. I got swept up in the moment. You were right. We can't be together. What happened between us, it can never happen again. I'm sorry, Freya. (door shuts) What is that? It's massage oil. It's making me feel numb. That means it's working. After you go numb, it'll be the most wonderful thing you've ever experienced. I love you, Freddie. I think you're a little drunk. (chuckles) No. I love you. I'm gonna try something, okay? I promise you won't feel a thing. (chuckles) What are you doing? You'll see. I love you too.
