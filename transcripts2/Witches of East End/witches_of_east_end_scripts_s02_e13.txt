 Previously on Witches of East End... 
 Every life, you come across Killian and you fall in love. 
 What did you drink? 
 Poison. 
 So I can be with Freya. 
 East End is turning out to be a very strange... place. 
 We need a dark spell to stop a dark warlock. 
 I love you. And not before long, you're gonna love me too. 
 Did you enjoy your visit, with... 
 Dash? 
 (screams) 
 Let's discuss your punishment. 
 (Teakettle whistling) 
 (Whistling stops) 
 You moved me. 
 I had to. 
 I needed a bit more room. 
 But I want you to know... 
 I do not take pleasure in your suffering. 
 I've had to do the same with Frederick over the years. 
 It's the only way you'll learn not to defy me. 
 Come. 
 Sit. Have some tea. 
 That's my girl. 
 I know you're too smart to try to escape while I'm standing right here. 
 You must be hoarse. 
 You were screaming a lot. 
 You were torturing me. 
 I prefer to think of it as... discipline. 
 Here. 
 It's goldenseal and lemon. 
 It'll heal your throat. 
 (Sighs) Very well. 
 Believe it or not, I took it easy on you... because of your condition. 
 My condition? 
 How are you feeling? 
 Nauseous? Tired? 
 I'm fine. 
 You don't know, do you? 
 I knew the minute I laid eyes on you. 
 You knew what? 
 You're pregnant, my child. 
 You're having a baby. 
 Come on, Joanna. 
 Where the hell are you? 
 Where did it go? 
 It disappeared. We're too late. 
 So now we're stuck here? 
 On the upside, it won't be for long. 
 We're gonna die if we don't get out of here. 
 The only way out just disappeared. 
 And you're making jokes?! 
 I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's a nervous tick. 
 Where the hell did mom go? 
 She probably got caught up kicking Tarkoff's ass. 
 She's just running a bit late. 
 Yeah, you think? 
 Definitely. 
 I'm not worried. 
 She hasn't been gone that long. 
 She'll be back soon. 
 Any minute. 
 And if she's not? 
 Then we'll find her, and we'll get out of this, or die trying. 
 That's not funny. 
 That one wasn't a joke. 
 Ingrid had the right idea staying back home. 
 She always was the smart one. 
 Oh, honey, I'm sure she's going through her own hell with your grandfather right now. 
 I wish I could text her. 
 The 1840s blows. 
 What did you say? 
 The 1840s blows. 
 Yeah, it does. 
 You just gave me an idea. 
 Freya, get off your ass. 
 We got to move. 
 Wait. Come on. 
 Stop it. 
 Stop. 
 (Laughs) This is just like when we were 16. 
 Back in the stables behind your father's castle. 
 You pushed me away then, too. 
 And you laughed at me. 
 You thought my love for you was funny. 
 But we're together now, darling. 
 And that's what matters. 
 We will never be together. 
 There is no spell that will ever make that happen. 
 There are many spells that can make that happen. 
 Joanna : We're in my bedroom. How did we get here? 
 Shh. 
 I think you need another dose. 
 Stop. 
 Shh. 
 Think of it as medicine. 
 It'll help keep your mind calm. 
 (Groans) 
 Bring you around to my way of thinking. 
 I've loved you for over 500 years. 
 And tonight... I'm going to have you. 
 Whoa, hang on there! 
 Sorry, I'm late... Judge Meyer at the courthouse. 
 He can wait. 
 I got the results back from the lab on that black gunk we found all over the floater. 
 Fantastic. What is it? 
 Mostly petroleum, but there's a bio-mass mixed in, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 
 Either way, it's a match. 
 So, the sample I brought in from Fair Haven... 
 Exact same stuff. 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 Excuse me. 
 Agent Moreau. 
 It's me, Dash. 
 Speak of the devil. 
 Look, I need to talk to you. 
 So talk. 
 It's a conversation I'd rather have in person. 
 Can you come over? 
 Sure. 
 (Piano playing) 
 So, are we cool? 
 Well, I'm not sure. 
 It seems rather warm in here to me. 
 It's an expression. 
 We're asking if you understand what we need you to do, and if you're willing to do it. 
 Assuming I am able, you have my word. 
 Great. We owe you. 
 Harboring a favor from the Beauchamps is fine currency indeed. 
 If this works, we may actually live long enough for you to collect. 
 And to that, I say... cool. 
 Tarkoff : ♪ after you've gone ♪ 
♪ and left me crying ♪ 
♪ after you've gone ♪ 
♪ there's no denying ♪ 
♪ you'll feel blue ♪ 
♪ you'll feel sad ♪ 
♪ you'll miss the dearest pal ♪ 
♪ you've ever had. ♪ 
 This isn't my bedroom. 
 Yes, it is. 
 No. 
 It's an illusion. 
 Don't take this the wrong way, but I wouldn't trust everything you see. 
 You're a little high right now. 
 We're still in the past, aren't we? 
 A little less so every second. 
 But the door... 
 If we stay here longer, we'll die. 
 It's okay, I know another way out. 
 Tell me. 
 When I'm ready, my love. 
 You make me sick. 
 Joanna, I won't let anything hurt you. 
 You're almost ready to accept me into your heart. 
 I can feel it. 
 You just need a little push. 
 Looks like you're out. 
 For now. 
 I'll be back in two shakes. 
 Don't go anywhere. 
 Think of this baby as an opportunity. 
 A new beginning. 
 I don't believe anything you say. 
 Besides, I thought you were just going to kill us all anyway. 
 I have no interest in your death. 
 I only want one thing from you. 
 What? 
 Your power. 
 Well, not just yours. 
 Joanna's, Wendy's, Freya's. 
 So, that's it? 
 That's why you're here... to steal our powers? 
 Not steal. 
 Take them back. 
 The reason you have the gifts that you do, is because of me. 
 I do believe you owe me. 
 Avolo! 
 Uh, uh, uh. Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk. Was I not clear? I've already taken yours. Thank you for that, by the way. I feel more powerful already. Tommy : I really would have taken you to Asgard with me. But now... I don't care. Such a shame. Now that your magic is gone, you will live out your sad little mortal life in this sad little place. Vertamus istud! Frederick! My dear boy. When will you ever learn? (Knocking on door) Come in. So? You said that there was something you wanted to talk to me about? I believe you have something of mine. What are you talking about? Don't bullshit me. I know you took them. Took what? The books, the journals. They were on the desk in the attic... or at least, they were last night. And now they're gone. And you're the only one who's been here, so... I didn't take your journals. Do I need to punish you to get you to tell the truth? I'd tread lightly if I were you. Oh, yeah? Why's that? There's five federal agents outside of your house right now. A search warrant? Are you joking? I wish I was. Raven! You... you actually think I'm a serial killer just running around carving symbols in people's chests? Agent Miller, the suspect has been served. You can enter the premises. Sorry, Dash. This is crazy! All right, whatever you think you're going to find here, you're not. I hope you're right. Ingrid : Frederick! Frederick, wake up. Please wake up. Oh, good! What's happening? You've lost a lot of blood and I can't heal you. Sana... sana. Oh... Where's Grandfather? I don't know. He left. Where'd he go? I don't know. We should get out of here, come on. What? Do you trust me to help you? You're still my brother. And I know you tried to save me. Plus my powers are gone. I don't have a choice. We need to get to Fair Haven. I think Archibald Browning's journal might have a spell that could help us defeat him. Grandfather wouldn't just leave us, it has to be a trick. Or he's counting on us being too scared to run away. Either way, let's just get out of here now. Hi. I remember her. Her name was Agnes. She was very bendy, one of our most popular girls. Oh, there're so many things wrong with that statement. Well, it was a different time, I was a different witch. Okay, I am officially worried about your mother. She should've been back by now. We need to figure out where the hell she went. I'm gonna try and track her. No! No! I'll smell her. What? Come on! Freya, I will find her. Trust me. I'm scared, Wendy. What if she's not okay? We don't have that much time. I know, that's why I have to shake my tail. Just meet us in the alley. Wait! (Mews) Not cool, Aunt Wendy. (Crickets trilling) Ingrid : Dash, we need your help and we don't have much time. Okay, what is it? Frederick : Show me Archibald's journals. I don't have them anymore. What?! Where did they go? I don't know. When I woke up, they were just gone. Did you read them? Yeah. I looked through them, but all the spells were in Old Norse. I didn't understand anything. How many did you look through? All of them. Great. Dash, you swore you wouldn't read the journals. You said you wouldn't even touch them. It's actually good that he read them. Ingrid, you said that the journals may contain a spell that would help us defeat grandfather. If he looked through all of them, the pages are locked in his mind. And I can get them out. How? With a mind spell. I'll be able to extract the information directly from your subconscious. (Coins jingling) ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ (Gasps) Freya? You're still here. Edgar. I'm sorry. I have to go. Then I'm going with you. (Grunts softly) (Groans) (Grunting) Thank you for doing this, Dash. Yeah. Look, Ingrid, there's something I need to tell you. There was an FBI agent here earlier. What?! She had a search warrant. And... and she confiscated a lot of things, it... Dash, your computer, those e-mails from Kyle Hutton! They're gone. I wiped the hard drive. It's totally clean. The... the thing is... I need you to know that no matter what happens, I'll keep you out of it. You can't keep me out of it, Dash. I helped you. No one knows that. And no one ever will. As far as I'm concerned, you were never here. Frederick : Dash, we have to get started. Let's go. You have to let go. Unlock your mind to me. That's the only way this will work. I'll do my best. Ingrid, translate fast. Ek lita innan hirtha! Ek lita innan hirtha! Farmath likami farmath und ykkar nu at ek etha thaool mech. This spell is about switching souls with another witch. It won't help us. Keep going. Ek eigi ni kunna... Summoning a demon? (Frederick continues speaking in ancient language) Reanimating dead flesh. Inducing madness. (Grunts) What are you doing down there? (Laughs) (Cries out) You've been a bad little girl. Let's get back into bed. (Grunting) I think it's time to up your dosage. (Grunts) Guess you can't read a cat's thoughts. Come on. We got to get out of here. (Grunts) (Gurgles, moans) Let's go. On the table. The talisman. Incendio! Oh! Get the soul-sucking box thing! Got it! (Indistinct chatter) We can check the wharf. We've already checked there. We've lost him. I should go to the alley and meet them. (Groans) Oh, my! I'm not feeling well. You're bleeding! It's already happening. What is? Nothing. Wendy will come through. We will make it home. Ingrid will find a way. Of course she will. I'll go with you and wait. No. Please don't... I want you to remember me like this. Why? What's going to happen to you? If all goes well, nothing. But my luck hasn't been the best lately. I've already lost you once. I can't do it again. I don't think I'll survive. I love you. Edgar, I know it doesn't seem like much, and it's a long time to wait, but you will see me again. Just not in this life. I have to get home to my love. I envy him. You will be him someday. Our souls are connected. Forever. No matter what may try to keep us apart, we always find each other. Never forget that. You'll see me again. I promise. Good-bye, my love. Good-bye. 
 
 Frederick : Kastau fráér lífi ínu inn sársauki... Spreading of pestilence. ... ok veikleiki leyfu mér at sna... Visions through time. ... ér hvat glei undir jarar vit vondrum... Possession extraction. Keep going. Eigi berjast í móti mér. Ek veit ú vilk mik. Komdu, me til helheims... Wait a minute, this one, with the dagger. The traveler, the bridge, the key... I think this is it! Dash, are you okay? I've been better. (Heavy knocking at door) Do you think that's Grandfather? (Knocking continues) No, he wouldn't knock. Come on. Let's go. Got it? Yeah. I'm looking for Ingrid Beauchamp. I'm sorry, do I know you? We've met. I've been waiting a very long time for this day. I have a message from Wendy and Freya. I've been carrying this with me for 166 years. They need your help getting home. (Panting) (Sighs) (Gasping) Freya, we're coming! It's Tarkoff! Run! Run! Freya! Come on! It's open, hurry! Go, Wendy. Go! Fraendo! Hurry! Get inside! Ingrid : Come on, hurry! Hurry! (Panting) (Panting) Tunc evanescunt ostium! (Exhales) I'm not bleeding anymore. Told you I knew we'd make it. No, you didn't. No, you're right. I thought we were all dead for sure. Joanna : Frederick. He helped us, mom. We could not have built the new time door without him. He really is on our side. I'll do whatever I can to help you defeat him. He lied to all of us. I should've known. He just wants your power. He already took mine. What? (Gasps) Ingrid : What happened? Freya : What is going on? (Gasps) Where's Wendy? He's taken her. (Gasping) I guess we'll just have to do this one by one. You were always my least favorite child. I'm going to enjoy killing you first. Where is she? I'll go check the attic. Ingrid : Maybe they're in the catacombs. Joanna : I can track her, but I dropped the Anima Aucupe in Baltimore, and it broke. After everything we've gone through, it's gone. Now we don't have a way to stop him? Ingrid : Actually, I think we do. I found a spell, but it requires me and you and mom and Wendy, and I don't know if it will work because my powers are gone. Well, we have to try. All right, I'm game. Let's do this. Let me come, I can help you. No, Frederick. This spell requires the key, the dagger, the bridge, the traveler and that's it. Wait, what does that mean? It's us. I'm the key, you're the traveler, mom's the dagger, Wendy's the bridge. I... I don't understand. I don't exactly understand it myself, but apparently we each have a unique gift. Grandfather knows this, and that's why he wants our powers. And that's why a spell to stop him requires we put these powers together. You can't help us with this, you'll only put yourself in danger. You stay here. Let's go. Mom. I love you. I know. Joanna : Let's go kick some ass. Do you know why I gave you your curse? I don't care. You're a coward. You always reminded me of a cat. A cold predator who only gives love when it serves her purposes. Or maybe I just never loved you. Remember when you were a child? You and Joanna would play with dolls. I knew even then she'd be a good mother, but you, on the other hand, you always... lost yours. Or broke them. You were never a selfless nurturer like your sister. That is why I made sure you could never have children. To spare them the horror of having you as a mother. I know who I am. Even though I'm not a mother, I'll risk anything for the people that I love. Not for much longer. Of course, if you beg, I will take your power... and spare your last life. Kill me if you want. You can't hurt me anymore. Every time you try, I just get stronger. (Chuckles) Oh... that's the only thing I ever admired about you, Wendy. Your... your bravado. You got that from me. I don't admire anything about you. You're just a sad, weak old man with no one to love! Soon, you will be floating in a lake of fire in the underworld, waiting for your final judgment at the hands of your sister. Your torture is just beginning. (Indistinct radio chatter) Dashiell Gardiner, you're under arrest. For what? Raven, I... You wiped your hard drive. But right now, destruction of evidence is the least of your charges. What charges? Murder. Since we couldn't get the information off your computer, we checked the ISP servers. We found some threatening e-mails. Clearly, someone was blackmailing you for attempting to murder your brother. We traced those to Kyle Hutton. Which then got me thinking. So I ran a DNA test on the murder victim that washed up on shore a few days ago. We got a match. Kyle Hutton. If anyone had a motive, I'd say it's you. Raven. Don't do this. I didn't bring these for fun. Turn around. Dashiell Gardiner, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can be used against in a court of law. Hello, Joanna. So glad you could join us. No matter how much power you steal from us, you will never be as strong as when we stand together. The dagger will set you free. Sica liberabit vos! Seriously? Chanting? Should've brought an actual dagger. (Grunts) The traveler will set you free. Sarcinulis liberabit vos. Well, this is cute. The whole gang is here. The key will set you free, you sadistic son of a bitch. Clavem liberabit vos! You, my dear, have no powers. Wendy, say it, "the bridge will set you free." She can't! She's contained. Ponte liberabit vos. Fortitudo! Freya : Amant! Liberatas! Victoria! Fortitudo! Amant. It's working. My powers are coming back. What are you doing to me? We're killing you, asshole. Ah! Fortitudo! Victoria! Why... Why do you do this to me? You are my children, my beloved children. You are flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood. Don't you know how... How much I... I... Keep going! Fortitudo! Amant! Liberatas! No! I am much stronger than you! Victoria! (Screams) (Screaming) Wendy : Tommy. Tommy. Tommy? He's dead. He's really dead. And it's my fault. No, honey. There was nothing you could do. He was already gone. I need a minute. We killed the king. It worked. Now we need to go check on Killian. Why? Freya : So, he drank poison? Ingrid : We just have to hope we're not too late. Oh, my God. He's dead. Ingrid, he's dead. Killian. Freya, I'm so sorry. It must have been too late to stop the spell. Why the hell would you do this?! He thought you were dead. He didn't want to live without you, and he thought he was making it possible for you to be together in the next life. So now he's just gone?! This can't be happening. We were meant to be together. He can't die! I'm so sorry, Freya. Killian. ♪ ♪ (Both gasping) You're alive. So are you. But you were dead. So were you. I don't understand. Neither do I. Oh, God, I love you. I love you, too. I'm... just gonna... give you guys a minute... alone. (Cell phone rings) Hello? Yes, this is Ingrid. What?! You guys, Dash has been arrested. Frederick, can you please call me? We did it. Your grandfather's dead. Sweetheart, where are you? Can you please come home. I forgive you. I just want to see you. I want to talk, okay? Call me. If I had listened to the signs, this never would've happened. I was selfish. And I altered your true fate. And I will make it right. For your sake and your daughter's. I love you, Tommy. Thank you for giving me the chance to make my last life count. Vitae est vestrum munus. ♪ ♪ (Door closes) Hey. What happened? It's a long story. I'm just glad you actually showed up. Well you asked me to come, so I'm here. Thank you. Where's Freya and Ingrid? Freya's outside waiting for me. Ingrid's at home. You said you didn't want her to see you like this. Yeah. Look, I know we've been... You know, but... I... I'm in a bad situation here. And I need your help. I don't know what to say to you. I want to punch you in the face right now. But I died today, and then I came back to life. And, uh... kind of feel like I won this one. Got everything I could ever want. So I don't need to hate you anymore, Dash. Not when you're in a situation like this. But if you're looking for help, I'm not exactly sure what I can do for you. Well then, let me just show you. Farmath likami! Farmath und ykkar! Farmath likami! Farmath likami! Farmath und ykkar! Nu! Dash. Dash, what the hell did you do? I'm not Dash anymore. I'm Killian. Get me out of here! No can do. Someone needs to take the fall, and it's not gonna be me. And no one will ever know. Not even Freya. It's undetectable. You are me, and I am you now. Forever. What? No. Come back here! Hey, man... don't do this! (Buzzer sounds) Hey! Hey. How is he? He's just not himself. Who would be? Yeah. I don't know what I'd do if I was in his place. We'll call his lawyer in the morning. I know this is a really horrible situation. But I'm so glad we have each other. I know exactly what you mean. I love you, Killian. I love you, too, baby. No, wait. Take me home, please. I want to be alone with you, finally. ♪ ♪
