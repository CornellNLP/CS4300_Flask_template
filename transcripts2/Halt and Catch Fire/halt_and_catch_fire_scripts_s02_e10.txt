 Narrator : Previously on AMC's  Halt and Catch Fire. 
 Cameron : If you're doing this for the company... 
 Donna : That's not why I'm doing this. 
 Gordon : Feels so good to just sit here, do the wrong thing with you. 
 Cameron : It's what it could've been. 
 Joe : This all began with a very talented young programmer named Cameron Howe. 
 Cameron : What if I don't accept your resignation. 
 Joe : I deserve better. 
 I deserve you. 
 Sara : God you're lost. 
 Cameron : I couldn't have done any of this without you. 
 Tom : No. 
 You did this all by yourself. 
 Jacob Wheeler : What the hell's happening? 
 Jesse Evans : I don't know. 
 Jesse :  Westgroup headquarters network off-line for over 80 hours. 
 New York's mainframe off-line for two days. 
 Hundreds of databases and disk drives are wiped, corporate banking has been frozen until our accounts data can be recovered, legal is drowning in calls from vendors and third parties... Just give me the damn numbers. Westgroup stock price is already down 8% and we're looking at an incurred cost of several million. And Joe? The board recognizes that he's to blame, but they don't feel it prudent to pursue a criminal investigation. (chuckles) So they chose a scapegoat. (chuckles) They'll be with you shortly. My wife, she's not here yet. Um, I'd like to speak with her before... I'll show her in when she arrives. Cameron :  So, this is Lev right here. Donna :  Lev, you look so cool online. Yeah, like in real life. (laughs) Cameron :  Okay, um... Bodie, why do you have a skull head? 'Cause it's wicked and awesome. Yes, okay, so each visualization is totally customizable. The more time you spend online, the more options become available to you. Yeah. So, walk here to Mutiny Mall, here to News & Updates... Is Town Hall ready for my admin talk tomorrow? Yeah, you just have to figure out what you want to look like online. Hey, uh, so since I'm taking over accounting, I just want to make sure I have the correct info for our new network partner. Is it Telnet or Telenet with an E? It's Telenet with an E. They're based out of DC and the guy we work with over there is Doug or Warren or... hey, how great is it we don't even know his name? Houston's officially up. How many new subscribers? With the promotion, I've had 29 sign-ups with the new 713 number in the last two hours. Conquering the world one area code at a time. (laughs) (whispers) This is so real. Let me see. Yeah, is there something else? Yeah, uh, if it's okay with you, I was wondering if I can move to Tom's desk. You see, his has two drawers and mine only has one, so I was thinking, "Dave, you bonehead, you wanna do accounting, you're gonna need more than one drawer." But they don't necessarily have to be Tom's drawers... Yes, fine. Whatever. Hey, have you, uh, heard from him? No. Um, how is Gordon? Good, good. I'm gonna go pick him up from a meeting in a couple minutes. (ringing) Dave :  I got it. Probably Telenet. They like to fax. They're big on faxing. (modem screeching) Don't worry, I got it. I was just hoping to speak with Sara before signing. She came in this morning. I'm sorry, someone should've told you that. (sighs) (music playing in background) (scoffs) You gotta be kidding me. Donna, look at this. (scoffs) Well, we're doing well, so they're charging us more. Great, great. Here we go again. No, it's because the pie is getting bigger. This is just part of the process. No, no, no, this is about being beholden to somebody else. I mean, it doesn't matter if it's Telenet or Westgroup or Doug or Warren or Joe MacMillan or the Pope. As long as we are on some other dipshit's network, this is gonna keep happening. We'll never be in the driver's seat. Well, the only places that have networkable hardware are big companies... I know. ...places that can afford the metal. This is time-sharing. This is the name of the game. You know... look, we'll counter Telenet, we'll do the dance. No, screw the dance. I want to change the music. I know. I know. Look, I gotta go. All right, let's wrap up the day by looking at our stress journals. Last session, I asked you all to note your stresses, big and small, conflicts, frustrations, fears, and rate them from one to five, five being the most stressful. First, I'd like to quickly go around the room and have everyone say their final stress tally out loud. Robert? 39. Paul? Uh, 24. That's excellent, Paul. Diane? 57. Why so much stress this week, Diane? The bus route changed, so I've been driving the girls to school myself and I had to go by K-Mart, and the K-Mart by our house isn't open yet, so now I have to go all the way to the one in Carrollton... Okay. We'll discuss that. Gordon? Uh, ahem, 0.28. That's pretty low. Must've been a good week. Yeah, nothing to report. I'm home, taking my medication. Kids are headed back to school, so... What registered the .28 of stress? Oh, uh, I couldn't find my glasses. Anything else come to mind? Something you might've failed to capture in your journal? Nope. Just seeing the glasses thing here, Brendan. Okay, well... since that's all we've got, that's what we'll workshop. Why don't you role-play your stress for us? Sure. I woke up and I thought... "Where are my glasses?" And then I found them and I said... (chuckles) "Here they are." No, let's get you on your feet. I'd like to see you act it out in the center of the group. Here, why don't you take them off and I'll hold them while you look for them? Okay, it's the morning. You just woke up, but can't find your glasses. Go. Oh, no. I can't find my glasses. Where are they? I'm never gonna be able to see again. I'm blind. Oh, no. Brendan :  Rather than caption what's happening, why don't you tell us how you're feeling? Right now I feel like I'm wasting my time. How do you feel about losing your glasses? I'm mad that I can't find them. What else? I'm, uh... I'm frustrated and I'm... I'm worried. Why are you worried? Because it's been a few minutes and I'm worried that I lost them and, I don't know,  I can't remember where they are,  and is this just me forgetting or is this something more? Does it scare you that your illness might progress? No. 'Cause they were on the damn kitchen counter. (Gordon exhales) (horn honks) (sighs) (theme music playing) Where is the peanut butter? Daddy keeps it up there. Hmm? My Eggo's still cold in the middle. Well, it's also drowning in syrup, so maybe that makes up for it. Excuse me! What kind of behavior is that? Why can't Daddy make breakfast? You suck at this. Joanie Marie! We all need to work together, okay? Your dad got a little upset. Like in California? Shut up, stupid. Hey, no name-calling. What happened in California? Nothing. Joanie? Daddy and Uncle Henry got into a yelling fight, and the three of us had to sleep in a crummy motel. Why didn't you tell me any of this? Because then you and Daddy would fight like him and Uncle Henry. Oh, what was the fight about? Joanie. Everything okay? Yeah, uh, Joanie didn't like her breakfast. We're out of orange juice. And there's no coffee. (whispers) It's okay, sweetheart. (phone rings) Woman :  Reception. I'll let him know. Mr. MacMillan, they're ready. Bondham :  Yeah, we had Mutiny in here,  but frankly I was on the fence about them from the get-go. And I heard they're doing pretty well recently. I'm chalking that up to dumb luck. Mutiny certainly isn't the answer to anything, but I will say this burgeoning online sector is the place to be in technology right now. Do you have something in mind? Mutiny's fine if I live in Dallas, but what if I want to access information in Toronto, San Francisco, Tokyo? What if I live in rural Nebraska where there is no service? So, what, you want to do the first online service in Omaha? Omaha is just a place on the map. I'm trying to make maps irrelevant. This service allows customers to dial in from one location  and dial out from banks in a completely different city. Something like this sidesteps long-distance fees. I'm gonna stop you right there. Now, you brought Westgroup into tech recently, right? WestNet? All that? I transitioned Westgroup into time-sharing and helped them realize a dormant passive income stream. So why did you torch it? I didn't. (chuckles) No, that's not what I heard. (clicks tongue) Here's the honest truth. We don't have a dime for ya. We took this meeting out of morbid curiosity. Now, the press story is that Wheeler botched the tech move, but I know some guys on the inside over there who told me the real story, and what I want to know is... why? Also how? Some destructive program? Right? A virus or something? You know, I looked into you, what you did at Cardiff. Immolating 100 computers out by Lake Texoma. Holy sh1t. (laughs) I am blown away. I've never met a legitimate psychopath before. We should buy this. IBM 3033 mainframe. It's a refurbish job. It needs a little love, but then we'd own it. No more network partners. Cameron... You know where I found this? Community. I went into the Tech Talk room, I wrote out the specs we'd need, and suddenly I had 100 Mutiny field agents on it. They found this thing in two days. This machine is 10 years old. It uses tape drives... Which we... Control unit is missing. And even if it wasn't in Daly City, California, this is all of our liquid cash plus most of our projected income for the next year, and that's before shipping. And even if we could get it on a truck to move it out here, where would we put it? Yes, there are challenges, sure, but we need to start moving in a... If you want to drive a submarine, you gotta join the Navy. Yeah, you might have to salute somebody every once in a while, but I... it's better than buying a rickety old diesel boat that sinks you to the bottom of the ocean. This is a reach, even for us.

No, no, I'm just trying out a steam-powered CPU. Look, I know what this looks like... like they parked the loony bird out back with his kiddy toys, but I'll have you know that these aren't just toys. This is rail transport modeling. I got this back when I was at Cardiff. I just never got around to it. (music stops) What's going on? I, uh... I just came by to give you something. What is this, a PROM? It's from the one we reverse engineered. You saved this. I've always kept it as kind of a private touchstone. Nice to have when times are tough. Sounds stupid, but... it always kept me going. Maybe you should hold on to it. Boy, it seems like yesterday, doesn't it? Yeah, it seems like forever ago. Look, I heard about what happened at Westgroup, and if there's anything I can do to help... There may be a way to repair the mainframe. After I blew up Mutiny, I tooled around with the Sonaris code, tried to see if there was any way to reverse it. You look good. I'm glad. W-what about you and Sara? Take care of yourself, Gordon. (music playing in background) There's a company off LBJ that's letting go of their 3081. That sounds promising. For a million bucks. (coders laughing) I knew he was crazy! So, Rendon walks back up to this girl and he goes, "Look, you can unplug the jukebox again if you want to, but I know that deep down inside you like Tom Petty, because everyone in this bar... no, in America... likes Tom Petty,  and it's only a matter of time before you realize that." (laughs) Tom Rendon and the Heartbreakers. (all laugh) You should just call him. Jesus. The girls are down. Oh, God, I am ready for this day to be over. You know, Telenet wants to have a conference call to discuss the rate hike. It never ends. Have you read this? Upwards of six million in damage and they actually refer to Sonaris by name. Did you take your medicine? Yes, Nurse Ratched. Westgroup's cover story is that some network assessment software went awry. I always hoped one of my inventions would go down in history. I just never knew it was gonna be a goddamn computer virus. Let's talk about something else, huh? (sighs) Joe stopped by today. I didn't mean Joe. He looked like hell. I don't think he's doing well. I'm sorry to hear that. (slams drawer) You know, he stopped by to give me the PROM chip from the IBM we reverse engineered. He had saved it. Ha. I've never seen him like this. I feel like he could do something... something desperate. All because of what Cameron did to him. Doesn't that disgust you? I mean, even just a little bit? You know, I don't think it's a good idea for you to get so worked up like this. You know what the doctor said. She destroyed his entire life, and for what, because he tried to help her? Well, it sounds like you're just going with Joe's version of events, then. Because I think he's telling the truth. Do you remember what kind of a partner he is? When you were in business with him last year, all the things that you accused him of? But this is different. Why? Why is it different now? Now suddenly when I experience the exact same thing you do, Joe is a nice guy? Why is he the victim? Joe might not be the most trustworthy person in the world, but what Cameron did to him is the most... We did it. Giving him the virus...  it was our idea, Cameron's and mine. You knew he was leaving Westgroup. I told you that. Yeah. Why would he have anything to do with WestNet? He already had one foot in California. The truth is, it doesn't matter. What do you mean it... He's toxic. You know that as well as I do. What? Last month when you were so worried that someone was stealing your idea, well, that actually happened to me. It wasn't just in my head. Who are you? It's like I don't even know you anymore. I mean, this entire year... Who am I? You kept a serious illness from me for nearly two months. Frankly, I don't know how honest you're being with yourself about it considering how out of control you've been. I am doing my best to deal with this, okay? - Oh, yeah. I'm taking the pills, I'm going to group. Which you think is a joke. I'm doing the... What? I saw you there making fun of it. You were not even trying. So you're spying on me in therapy? Unbelievable, Donna. Yeah, because you keep things from me. Well, it sounds like to me we're keeping things from each other. Well, while we're on the topic of secrets... I would like to know what happened in California. Joanie told me that you and Henry got in a shouting match that was apparently so bad you had to take the girls to a motel. Why would you not tell me that? Because, Donna, I had an affair! (voice breaks) What? (whimpers) It was one night. It was meaningless. It was absolutely stupid. Do I regret it? Yeah, every minute of every day. When I found out I was sick, I looked around for my marriage and it wasn't there. You weren't there. Maybe...  maybe this has been broken for a long time, and we're the only ones who don't know it. Joanie. Joanie, sweetheart. (door slams) (gurgling) Ow. (sizzling) (sputters) 
 
 (door opens, closes) Hey. You're here early. I don't know that Gordon and I love each other anymore. And I don't know... I don't know if we can fix it. And I don't even know if I wanna fix it. I don't know what it's like... um, marriage. Being married, it's... I don't know, I won't pretend to understand. What you and Gordon have, or don't, um, I mean, that's something only you two can figure out. I do know that once in a while, you know, life can give us a sign... point us to a different place, make good things come out of bad. If it weren't for Cardiff Electric, there would've never been a Mutiny, and... you know, if it weren't for Gordon Clark, I would've never met you. Listen, I don't want to add to your misery here, but the coffeemaker is broken, so... (laughs) I think we should move to California. Here. The diesel sub. Look, if we can't bring the mainframe to Mutiny, maybe we bring Mutiny to the mainframe. I think life is giving us a sign here. Yes, we will have to beg, borrow, and steal the money for it, but I... it would be a fresh start. And I think that that's something that we could both use. (birds chirping) Hey. What's up? Can I come in? I love what you've done to the place. Listen, I was the one who wrote the code that took everything down. Okay? It was me... You didn't do anything wrong. Yeah, but neither did you. I appreciate that, but... it doesn't really matter. What about Sara? Joe? Damn it. You're a good man. You make it really difficult for other people to see that, but I see it, and I suspect she had something to do with that. That supposed to make me feel better? Look, I just came by to give you this. I went into the Sonaris code, fixed the missing branch error. Not only that, this version targets older copies. It eradicates them. I muscled it up some, too, so it'll inoculate machines from future infection. I mean, it's... it's one hell of an antidote. I mean, it won't undo the damage done, but maybe you can use it to make things right. Or a sign of good faith to Jacob Wheeler. I don't care about Jacob Wheeler. Then screw him. Do it for Sara. When we came to dinner here that night, you said to me, "She makes all the suffering of what we do worth it." And I'm telling you, that is not an easy thing to come by. And when you do, it's... it's even harder to make it last, and, I don't know. Maybe it can't, but... I do know that you'll hate yourself every day if you don't at least try. Okay. Yeah, okay. Hey, man, come here. (pats back) (exhales) Take care of yourself, Joe. (door closes) (chatter) So I go in and I tell him, I said, "Now, it looks like we're gonna finish the year 110% of quota." My God, the accountant's looking at the numbers. He's going, "Well, it says here 83%, Mr. Bosworth. Says here 83. " And I go, " Man, are you including Bannister? That's a $2 million deal, man." He goes, "Well... well, Bannister didn't close in Q4." And I said, "Sure, it did. I closed that son of a bitch on the 35th of December myself." (all laughing) I tell ya, he's full of these. Get him going, he won't stop. Well, James, you were right about your daddy. A month in, he's already whipping this place into shape. I had no doubt. Well, it's a damn fine place to work, I gotta say. And thank you for inviting me to this big muckety-muck lunch here. Ah, I know you're only manager level now and we're not fast-tracking anything here, but, well, we thought it'd be good for you to hear how things are operating at the upper levels, have your voice in the room. And, Mr. Stern, it goes without saying that I sincerely appreciate the invite to sit down with the senior team today. A junior boy like me is a guppy at this table. Well, without you, we wouldn't have John. Well... You know, I... I must've told this one about a million times, but I remember when I was a kid, a manager comes in and... (laughs) ...he says, "Now, Joe, you're under quota. We need to be in the black." So I look at him, I toss my coffee cup up on the forecast, and I say, "Now how's that for bein' in the black?" (muffled laughter) - (conversation continues indistinctly) (ringing) (birds chirping) (music playing in background) Donna? Donna? Whoa, Gordon, what do you want? Hey, where's Donna? Okay, Gordon, I think you need to back off for a little bit. Damn it, this has nothing to do with you. Gordon, I want you out of my house. Hey. Is she here? What the heck is going on? Is she here? Who? Oh, Christ, I thought she was with you. Gordon, what are you talking about? I can't find Joanie. She's not at the house. She's not at your parents' house. Haley said she ran away. Okay... (sighs) You haven't seen her at all? Sometimes she rides bikes with Heather after school. (car door closes) Okay, well, just let me know. Thanks. Did you... I didn't see her on Marion and I went all the way to Belt Line. Oh, what about the, um... She's not in the cul-de-sac and she's not down by the creek either. Okay, so, uh, her backpack is gone, her lunch box is gone, her sleeping bag... Donna, I need you to know that I didn't... look, this wasn't me. I didn't... God damn it, I didn't lose her. Haley said that she ran away, okay? Donna, I need you to know that this wasn't me. Mommy, Daddy, look. What is that? It's our camping lantern. I had to leave. I told a secret. And it made you not in love anymore. Hey, hey, listen. Your mom and I may get into an argument sometimes, okay? But it's never because of you, okay? Are you gonna get divorced? Mommy and Daddy love each other very much. But there are some things that we need to talk about. So why don't you go up to the house, give your sister a big old hug, and you two can pick out what kind of pizza to get for dinner, okay? Good girl. Come here. (sighs) (door opens, closes) I don't want to be the woman that leaves her husband when he's sick, but that doesn't mean I won't. I thought a lot about what you said and I think you're right. This marriage isn't working, so we need to do what's best for the kids and what's best for us. So here are my terms. You're gonna write a check. It's gonna be for almost as much money as we have, and we're gonna use it to buy a 3033 mainframe. Not only that, you are gonna help me fix it up and get it running again. The mainframe is in Daly City, so, yes, you are going to move to California. We all are. That is what it costs to fix our marriage. So what is this, extortion? No, it's an investment. Not just in a mainframe, but in something that you believe in or something I thought you believed in before you did what you did. Look, I know it was wrong and I'm sorry. I told you it was a mistake. No, I can't... I don't want to talk about that. (exhales) Cameron is going to offer you a job at Mutiny and you are gonna take it. You want me to work at Mutiny? No, I want you to work with me. And this taking turns, this one person holding the kite strings while the other person is off chasing something, that isn't working. You really think that moving to California is gonna fix everything? I don't know. But it's the best thing I could come up with. And I do know that if we stay here, we are not gonna make it. Sir, it's already been three hours. I suggest you make an appointment, come back at a more reasonable time. Hey. I was wondering how long you'd wait. (chuckles) I'm surprised, Joe. You are persistent. I'll give you that much. I, uh... Ooh. I wanted to show you something. (computer screeches, beeps) See, after my time at Cardiff, I went away. I decided I should do things differently, operate from a place of total authenticity. Be open, be human, do the right thing. But the truth is, no one else made that pact with themselves. So why should I? What is this? Damn it. Your computer's now infected with a virus, the same one that took down Westgroup. It's a malignant fetch program, and it will spread from this box to every other networked computer in your organization. Oh, my God. I'm calling security. Security? You want security? Why, 'cause you don't trust me? You don't know what I'll do. Who knows what I'll do? When there's no trust, you're vulnerable. Just because you play by the rules doesn't mean anyone else will. So what should you do? (hangs up phone) You should protect yourself, build a wall. Not like that, like this. (computer beeps) (keyboard clacking) Do you know what a vaccine is? It's not medicine; it's a little bit of the virus. You take a little bit of something bad so you can never be hurt like that again. (keyboard clacks) (computer beeps) Check it out. Ahem. (keyboard clacks) (computer beeps) It's... how'd you do that? With an antidote to the poison. Sure, this program only protects your machine from this specific virus, but the real product here is security, a shield against those who would hurt you, perhaps because of their own carelessness or simply because they want to destroy you. And after the national exposure of what happened at Westgroup, entire organizations are going to be ravenous for this. The real security is trusting no one. And you came up with this all on your own? Pizza's here! Yay! All right, guys, be careful. Don't burn yourselves, okay? (phone ringing) Hello? Joe :  Gordon, it's me. Hey. "Create the sickness, sell the cure." What? "Create the sickness, sell the cure." You remember when you came over to my place? I can't talk right now, Joe. No, no, no, I took your advice, Gordon,  and I turned this into something good, really good. That's great. I'm glad, but, look, I gotta go. No, no, you gotta hear me out. You'll be glad you did. We should celebrate, Gordon. We've got an incredible opportunity. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you and me together, partnering again. What... what are you doing right now? We gotta talk this through. I'll come over. Look, I can't do this anymore. Donna and I are moving to California. Great, we can do this in California. In fact, we should. I'm going to work for Mutiny. I need to focus on my family right now. You're going to work for Mutiny? Listen, Joe, I... I didn't... (birds chirping) Whoa. Good morning. So, here's my offer. While Mutiny is no longer a games company, we are relocating to California and could use a talented hand like yours as we attempt to take our service national. I don't need an answer right away. I just... you can decide if you want to be on the 8:45 out of DFW tonight. And even if you don't want the job, just come anyways. It's a free plane ticket. That's not a lot of time to decide. Or maybe it's just enough time not to overthink it.
