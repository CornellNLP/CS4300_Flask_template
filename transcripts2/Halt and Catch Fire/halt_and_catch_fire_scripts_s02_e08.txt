 Narrator : Previously on AMC's Halt and Catch Fire. 
 West Group wants to buy you. 
 I'm coming over with an acquisition offer tomorrow. 
 This is not a death sentence. 
 I'm okay. 
 Mutiny's killer app isn't games, it's people. 
 Cameron! 
 Lev's in the hospital. 
 It was a bunch of guys, pretending to be a person on community. 
 Our first order. 
 We're officially in business. 
 I wanna get married. 
 Today. 
 We already made our decision. 
 No, YOU made our decision. 
 Don't sell. 
 He'll ruin it. 
 This is my company. 
 And I'm not selling it. 
 (keyboard clacking) 
 ( "Spinning Round" playing over headphones ) 
 (knock on door) 
 Joe told me they were gonna mess with it, with Mutiny. 
 And now you decide to believe him? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 He was telling the truth. I could tell. 
 (scoffs) 
 I just could. 
 What, are you mad? 
 Yeah, I am. 
 I wanted to sell. And I'm not the only one, by the way. 
 But you completely disregarded that  based on some mysterious feeling you got off the one person you told the rest of us never to trust. 
 I'm not going to apologize. 
 Is that going to be a problem? 
 No. 
 When we're able, I think we should find another network. 
 It's about time we got out of the Joe MacMillan business. 
 Yeah, agreed. 
 (keyboard clacking) 
 Jacob :  When? 
 This morning at City Hall. 
 We wanted to tell you first. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Don't you think that's something I'd wanna know about? 
 To be there? 
 Well, we wanted it to be the two of us. 
 (soft laugh) 
 No big party, just two people in love. 
 (sighs) 
 Don't be upset, Dad. This is good news. 
 I'm happy for you. 
 It's just... you're my daughter. 
 Joe, I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to be at my only daughter's wedding. 
 Sir, we meant no disrespect. 
 You seem to be making a habit of springing things on people. 
 We did this together. It wasn't inflicted on me. 
 It was my decision, actually. 
 Look, why are you making this about you? 
 I just told you I got married. 
 You should be happy for me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Congratulations. 
 To both of you. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll go tell Caroline. 
 Maybe I'll get a better reaction out of her. 
 I take it there's something else you want to discuss with me? 
 Um... 
 Sara can't stand Caroline. 
 (laughs) 
 As much as I appreciate the opportunity you've given me here, I think it's time for me to move on. 
 Sara and I are moving to California. 
 I'm sorry to lay all this on you at once. 
 No, no, no. You're right. 
 Maybe it is time to move on. 
 No hard feelings. 
 Best of luck in all your future endeavors. 
 Uh, I'm happy to help you find a replacement. 
 No, that's okay. I'll leave that up to our people. 
 They'll find the right guy. 
 Okay. 
 I can stick around until you've got someone in place. 
 (chuckles) Don't be silly. 
 I couldn't give my daughter a wedding. 
 The least I can do is give her a honeymoon. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 Ask Caroline for the keys to my private garage. 
 There's a '57 Bel Air convertible in there, pristine and ready to go. 
 Take it for a couple of weeks. Hit the road. 
 Uh, I'll talk to Sara about that. 
 Thank you. 
 You bet. 
 I, uh... sorry the Mutiny deal didn't go through. 
 (chuckles) 
 I've been in this game long enough to know things don't always break my way. 
 Enjoy the honeymoon. 
 (floorboard creaks) 
 (floorboard creaking) Psst. (gasps) Hey, Gordon. Ah! Ah! What the heck? Sorry. (groans) You okay? What was it? It was nothing. It was nothing. (theme music playing) (chatter) (spray can rattles, hissing) Coder :  Hey, how's this look? Get that ice. Okay, we did the debugging of the staircase... and you reconfigured the game menu? Hmm? Yeah, I want to go over it briefly, but, yeah, I think we're basically there. We are there. We did it. It's done. It's perfect. No. No. I want to tweak a few more things and copy protect it and maybe rewrite some of the scroll at the top. It's messy. What? Copy protect it? But we don't do that. We're Mutiny. Uh, well, we both wrote some pretty bitching code. You want someone taking that? I learned to code by copying other people's work, pulling it apart. So did you. Yeah, I've also had my work stolen. It's not pretty. We never would've met if you had copy protected "Parallax." Yeah, but we did meet. So, because we met, now I can copy protect our work without fear of us not meeting. Come on, we wrote this amazing game. I don't want anyone taking it from us. Bosworth :  Hey, Cameron, you coming or what? All right, yeah, everything's squared away. Okay, kegs have been delivered, tables are here, nitwit's setting up the PA out back. You bringing anybody? Maybe. We'll see. This is gonna be so much fun. Ugh, it's gonna be like a hundred awkward first dates at once. God, who are these people? We don't even know. It's a nice way to say thank you for sticking with us through all the ups and downs. Which brings us to our next topic. Uh, we're doing great. Community's raking it in. Hell, we got more and more users staying on for longer. (laughs) Uh, and games? Well, they're not growing as fast, but those users are loyal. Those boys ain't goin' anywhere. Can we afford to switch networks yet? Uh, not quite. Almost. A few more weeks like the last couple, we'll get there. Okay. Uh, that's it. (drums) Great. (door opens, closes) Uh-huh. 15 orders today. (doorbell rings) Yeah. I got it. How many is that? Around 250 last I counted. 250? Yeah, I took out some ads in some high-end lifestyle magazines. I told those dillweeds they'd wanna stick around. How are we supposed to keep up with that with only two of us left? Well, we'll hire some more people. Company thriving like this, we can afford some young talent. What's that? It's a return. The serial port wasn't installed correctly. No way. Come on, guys. Who did this one? (laughs) Look who I found. Big, bad Stan! Howdy, fellas. What are you doing here? Oh, back in town for a bit. Thought I'd stop by, see how you guys are doing. How's everything going out West? What are you working on? Oh, this and that. A few things. Just sort of germinatin'. It's great. There's more VC money flyin' around than anyone knows what to do with. How's it going here? Oh, great. Going really great, you know? A little too great. So unless you wanna pick up a screwdriver and pitch in, we got work we've gotta do. Okay, well, I'll probably head over to the Landing in a little bit if you guys want to meet up for lunch. Yeah. Sure thing. Sounds good. (snaps fingers) (Jacob and man chuckling) Ah, here he is. Joe, this is Jesse Evans. Oh, welcome. It's great to meet you. You, too, man. You, too. Really excited to be here. How was the trip? Wonderful, thank you. Went on our honeymoon out West, sort of scouting it out. Joe is absconding with my daughter to California. Um, started my own thing, talked to a few VC firms. That's fantastic. I'm just coming from there. You know Mark Merlis? Yeah, go back to my IBM days. Great guy to talk to. Knows everybody. He put me in touch with Bob Reed and Stuart Woods. Amazing. They're in my pickup basketball game. You'll have to sub in for me now that I'm here. You know Jeff Archer? I'll get you his info. Great guy, super smart. What were you doing out there? I started an online service, Symnet. Did pretty well. Eventually got bought out by Oracle. Turned that money into a few different ventures... a couple out West, one in Tokyo. You know how this business is. Always gotta be moving in every direction. Yeah, sure do. Really love what you got going on here, though. It's a fantastic opportunity you spotted. Oh, thank you. A good friend of mine did the hardware work, Gordon Clark. He's coming by later to walk you through it. Great. Use all the help I can get in that department. Jesse's more of a big picture guy. So, what is the big picture as you see it? In Q1, we could be in four cities... Dallas, New York, San Francisco, and London. By Q4, we could be in 24. Positioned around the globe as we are,  a company this size, we can arrive on the scene a major player right away. None of the uncertainty of a fledgling outfit. (Jesse's voice fades) (phone ringing) Hello? (static hissing) Hello? (quietly) Jules? (footsteps approach) (knocks) Oh, hey. What's up? How was lunch? Good, good. We brought you a sandwich. Oh, thanks. Thanks. Uh, Gordon, we've been giving it some thought, and, um, I think... it's... it's not that we don't believe in what you're doing here. No, no. Heck, no. But we just need something a little less risky. Need something? What, you're quitting? What's the risk? We got 250 orders waiting to be filled. We sure do, but we're a little old to be bettin' our future on this. So, what? Stan take you out, fill your head with visions of VC money flowing through the streets? Oh, no, that's not it at all. You know, these fancy Silicon Valley companies started out somewhere, and it's not in a big corporate office. It's in a garage with three guys rolling up their sleeves, betting on themselves and making something great. Come on, we are in this together. You know what? It's fine. It's fine. You know, you guys are gonna be the ones on the outside lookin' in. I'm sure you're right. But right now I... I think we've pretty much made up our minds. (phone ringing) You gonna answer that? (ringing continues) Hello? Joe :  Who's Jules? What? I called a second ago. I think the connection was bad. Oh, uh, no one. What do you want? You were supposed to be at Westgroup half an hour ago. Oh, yeah. I... I forgot. I'll be right over there. (sighs) Sorry, Gordon. I'm sure you'll do fine without us. You guys are a couple of cowards. (laughter, chatter) Hey! (button clicks) ( "East of Eden" playing in background ) The first users are showing up! Hi, welcome. I'm Donna Clark. You can help yourself to some food and beer's over in the hot tub. You're Donna Clark. Yeah. I pictured you as fat. Like, really fat. Thank you? Hi there. (chattering) Hey, where's your costume? I thought we were going in character, spy and sentry. Uh, yeah, we talked about it, but I didn't... Seriously? Now I look weird. (laughs) Well, are you comin'? I'm... uh, yeah. I'm gonna do some work and finish up, but I'll be out in a minute. Okay. You look good. Thanks. It's all standard except for the custom cabinets. Connect the PBXs to the SNA inputs on the 3090, okay? It's all here, but you can give 'em my number if need be. Mm, back it up a little bit. I need you to walk him through what we've done. I don't have time for that. Just give him this, tell him what I told you, he'll understand, all right? Okay. Everything all right? Yeah, I'm good. How are you? How's, uh...? Sara. She's great. Good. We got married. What? (laughs) Yeah, we spent the past couple weeks in California on our honeymoon. No kiddin'. Congratulations. See you later, Joe. Yeah. Think we're movin' out there, to California, so we'll be leaving. So this might be good-bye for a while. Well, hey. Best of luck. Yeah, you, too. Have we landed on the moon? Of course not. I mean, you guys have seen "Last Starfighter," right? They can do anything with special effects these days, and who has access to that technology first? Hollywood? (laughs) I don't think so. ( "A Spy in the House" playing in background ) James, how are ya? Okay, so, this is Mutiny. Yeah, this is it. Come on, let me show you around. Hey, Bodie. This is my son James. Weird. Nice to meet you. Boz has a son. (laughs) Come on. You know, I tell you, James. It may not look like much, but these kids are brilliant. You would not believe. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Why aren't you outside? Uh, I'm just finishing up the game. I'll be out in a minute. The game is done. Come on. This is your company. Well, I guess it was stupid to think I talked you out of it. Oh, come on. I'm protecting our work. Do you have any respect for me? I respect the sh1t out of you. You don't value my opinion... never mind. No, Tom. What? Come on, everyone is pissed at me in this house and no one's saying anything. It's driving me crazy. What is it? Okay, it pisses me off that I told you that I wanted to sell, and then Joe tells you that you shouldn't... Oh, God. ...and that you listened to him. You want to sell? Tom, they were gonna ruin this company! It's not about... no, it's not about the sale. It's about you and me. Fine, you know what? Just break up with me if you're gonna break up with me and we can... I'm not gonna break up with you. I'm just... I'm just mad at you, okay? And I can be mad at you, right? So, what, you wanna quit? No, I don't want to quit. I love you. Why would I quit? Have you ever had a disagreement before? We're just talking. People talk. They fight. They argue. It happens every single day. (exhales) You love me? What? N-no... now you're putting words in my mouth. No. You said those words. (knock on door) Hey, there she is, the big boss, Cameron. This is my son James. H-hi. (laughs) (phone ringing) Hello? Hey, hey, sweetie. How's camp? Oh, yeah? What'd you make? A rocking horse? All by yourself? Did you paint it? Purple? Son of a bitch. No, sorry, sweetheart. Not you. That all sounds great, sweetie. Look, Dad's gotta go, okay? Will you call me tomorrow? Okay. Okay, I love you. Yeah, Gordon Clark's got a unique mind. Clearly. This is pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, if you're gonna switch over to a more conventional setup, maybe it'd be best if I stuck around for a few days  to help troubleshoot with you. You got bigger fish to fry. California's calling, right? Yeah. (chuckles) You should definitely bring on a hardware specialist. The expansion's gonna require lots of expertise in that area. I got it from here. It's my problem to worry about. Thanks for your help. 
 
 (door opens) ( "Reminds Me" playing in background ) (chatter) Donna :  Lev? Lev, you made it! Lev :  Hey, guys. Yo-Yo! (Yo-Yo laughs) That's funny. Donna :  You look good, kid. Hi. Welcome back. I wasn't about to miss this. I know. Wanted to see what these freaks were like in person. It's really good to see you. Lev! You look so fragile. I want to hug you, but... Just be careful, Bodie. Heard the new game was pretty cool. Decided to check it out. Yeah, I think you'll dig it. Thanks for coming. Cameron? Yeah. Hey, we're all here now. I feel like it's a good time to say something. Yeah, go ahead. No, not me, you. No, Donna, I really don't like to do that. (groans) Okay. Go. (music continues) (music stops) (feedback rings) Hey. Hello, hi... oh, hey. (laughs) Hi, hi, everybody. Uh, I've met a lot of you already, but to those of you I haven't, I'm Donna Clark. Thank you all for coming. And now I would like to introduce to you the mind behind Mutiny, our leader Cameron Howe! (cheering) All right, Cameron! Howe! Howe! Howe! (laughing) Hi, I'm Cameron. Nice start! Uh... (laughs) Bosworth :  There it is. Um... oh, we have an announcement to make. Uh, today we're putting the finishing touches on our latest game. It's called "Extract & Defend." Yeah! How many gamers do we have here today? Man :  Yes! (scattered applause) Whoo! Well, I think you guys are really gonna love what we've done, so... Come on. Let's grab a beer. Man :  All right. Talk to your publisher friend? Jeanette? Yeah. I'm gonna meet with her for coffee once we're back out there. How was your last day? How's the new guy? Uh, yeah, he's great. Like him a lot. Young. Doesn't have the hardware experience I would've expected, but... (pops lips) seems nice enough. You hated him? What? No. Not at all. Well, there's a palpable hate energy here. Oh, I don't know. I can't put my finger on it. (sighs) He seems like an odd choice for the job. You're gonna miss it. Oh, there'll be other projects way more exciting than trying to take an oil company into the future. Of course, yeah. Hey, come here. (sighs) Come here. You're a force of nature. All right? You make the world what you want it to be. It'll happen in California, too. H-how about this? How about we step out of reality for the night, a hard reboot? I think once you're outside, you'll realize what's really important. How do I get on the outside? Well, I found something when I was cleaning out the closet. What is that? MDMA. From when I was doing the exposé. Let's go out tonight. Let's go to the Starck Club. We can bid Dallas a fond farewell. Show them what they'll be missing. You remember College Sara? Yeah. (laughs) I couldn't keep up with her. Well, you'd better do your best. ( "Police on My Back" playing ) (music continues) Hey, you made it! Thank God! There's some people here you really have to meet. This one guy, he proposed to his girlfriend after they met on Community. How cool is that? That's, uh... that's great, honey. Look. What? What is this? Someone stole my idea. Oh, well, your idea is about you. It's about Gordon Clark. Computers handmade by an expert. Who knows who these guys are? All right, look. The price point's the same. I mean, the slogan's nearly identical. Gordon, come on. Let's get a beer. Let's enjoy the party. I think it was Stan. What,  Stan,  Stan? I think he got Ed and Larry involved. Should I go over there? I mean, should... No. Should I say something? No, I don't think so. Look, we can... we should take a careful look at this tomorrow. It's probably just a coincidence. Even if it's not, there's nothing they can do to hurt Clark Computers 'cause they don't have the most valuable asset, right? Come on, let's go hang out a little bit. No. I think I'd better go home. I'm feeling a little fried. Oh, okay. Yeah, go... go get some sleep, then. Okay. (mutters) Hey, Donna! Check this out! Oh, hey. (music continues) Oh. Thanks. Cameron Howe? Yeah. Sorry, you don't know me. My name is Gretchen. This is your company, right? Uh... yeah. Yeah, it is. I just want to say thank you. Um... My family's kind of screwed up. Well, really screwed up. I didn't have anyone to talk to about it until I found Mutiny. There are a bunch of people dealing with the same sort of stuff and they help me. They helped me realize that... that I could walk away. (voice breaking) That there wasn't anything wrong with me. And I couldn't have done that without you. I'm sorry if that sounds weird. No. Oh! Thank you. No, it's not at all. ( "Why" playing in background ) (air hisses) (cheering) This feels so good! Oh-ho, really? Try and keep up. ( "Chamber of Hellos" playing in background ) Hey, how's the bride? Uh... You gonna pop out a couple of pups? Oh, we'll see. We got time. It'd sure make your mom happy. (laughs) That's a terrible reason to have children. (laughs) Yes, indeed. Oh. Well, James... thanks for coming. Sure. Listen, Dad, I know about this job opening. It's, uh, an account manager's position. And I know you left Cardiff as a VP, but it's a solid company. I know the people. I could put in a good word. We can get you out of here. Thank you, James. Yeah. Okay, all right. (laughs) All right, good night. All right, good night, son. Hey, you've been avoiding me. No, I haven't. Yes, you have. Ever since you said you love me. Yes, fine. I love you. In fact, I would say "I love you" is a dramatic understatement. I think you're incredible in pretty much every way. If it's gonna be a problem for you, then I don't know what to say, because... it is what it is and it's not gonna change, even when you're being a total pain in the ass, like you have been this entire day. Okay. (soft laugh) Just say the words, okay? This is gonna be so much weirder if you don't just say the words. (groans) Hey, hey, hey. Look at me, look at me. Say the words. No. (tsks, laughs) What's... say the words. Just say them. You're terrible. I take it back. I take it all back. (light switch clicks) Jesus, Gordon? What the hell are you doing here? I know you stole my idea. JGL Computers. Sound familiar? You had the guys sabotage me. The serial ports, putting my name on the back of it just to make Clark Computers look like a joke. I have no idea what you're talking about. Why else would you come back from California? Huh? You gonna use some of that VC money to get it started, you son of a bitch? I came back because I was tired of being laughed out of the room by a bunch of 25-year-olds. I washed out. Well, then, what the hell are these? I gotta make ends meet. I'm doing repairs. I'm driving around all day picking up these busted machines. Gordon, can I ask? Are you doing coke again? What? No, of course not. Why would you even think that? 'Cause you're in my garage in the middle of the night accusing me of stealing from you. Donna told the guys to keep an eye on you,  and according to them, you've been acting a little nuts. Donna told you what? I don't know. But the guys said... now I'm getting into the middle of something that I don't want to get... Told you what? That... she said to tell her if you were acting strange or, you know, like the job was taking a toll on you or something. She was worried about you. Donna? Unbelievable. You think she's trying to shut me down? God, it's the same thing all over again. No, no, no, you got it all wrong. She was looking out for you. (car doors open) You called the cops on me? (garage door opening) Stan, why would you call the cops on me? Because I heard someone breaking into my house. Stan, what were you thinking? Why would you do that? Hey, what the hell? It's okay. That's it, that's it. I just want to talk to my friend  and ask him why he called the cops on me. I just wanted to talk... (grunts) ( "Cccant You See" playing in background ) (laughs) You're amazing. Amazing. I feel like there's a lot of goodness in me, a lot of greatness, but I can't get it out of me. I can't give it to the world. I have ideas. I'm not an echo. I make things in my mind, but I can't get them into the world. I can't get past this. It's like a trap. Like the world won't see the... me... the real me. Oh, no, I see you. You're a force of nature. You're gonna change the world. I have ideas. Online could be more. It could be more than just inside bullshit for anointed coder shitheads. It could be universal. You could live your life there. It would change everything, I promise you. The world we live in now is going to look like the Stone Age. All these people with their things. The physical world is dead. A pathway is being built. A way out, into a world of pure information. A shared consciousness. The future is bearing down on us like a freight train and nobody sees it. ( "Boy" playing in background ) Oh. Is this a good good-bye? You ready to get the hell outta Dallas? I just wanna say one last good-bye. (air hisses) (cheering) (laughing) I kept telling myself that Mutiny was games, we are about games. And I think... I knew that if I went outside today and saw what you'd done that I wouldn't be able to tell myself that anymore. It turns out I was right. I just want this place to be about exploration. I'm sorry that I stood in your way. Thank you. I'd like to be a part of it. You are a part of it. You built this place. No, but I mean... so, on the game side, we're always pushing the code, right? We're trying to get the most out of it. But what if we applied that same pressure to Community? I mean, the functionality of it could explode. It could run faster, smoother between subjects or finding certain users' conversations. Yeah, yeah, all of that, and then also we could make the interface more like a game's interface, except not. But, you know, it was a world to navigate and not a list, but it was a map, you know? (moaning) (grunts) (laughs) (moans) This place turns you on? You have no idea. (laughs) (men cheering) Oh, my God. (whispering) Okay, we gotta go. Come on. Pants... (laughing) I want to see what's going on. No, no, no, wait. They can't see us. If my father hears about this, I'm gonna die. You go to the limo and I'll meet you there. I'm... I'll be stealthy. (chatter) (laughs) (men cheering) Man :  What's better than this? Jesse :  All right, hey, hey, hey. (laughs) Okay. I just wanted to come down here to say job well done, guys. It was a bitch of an assignment, but you guys stepped up, seriously. So... Man :  Oh! To WestNet! (men cheering) (men chattering) Oh, my God, and then you could, you know, walk from topic to topic. Yeah, and better than that, you could find other users at those places. Yes, okay, I feel like we have to write this down. Do we have something... Carl, could you clear off the bulletin board? We need to create a layout for Community. I want a list printed of every room... Carl. Carl, what are you looking at? I... I don't know what I'm looking at. I logged into Mutiny. Try to log on as an administrator. (keyboard clacking) (beeps) Uh, I'm locked out. What's wrong? I don't get it. Where's Mutiny? We're kicked off the network. Replaced by this. There is no Mutiny. It's gone. (cars passing) Change of plans. I'd like to make another stop. (chatter) The phone lines terminate in modem banks at Westgroup. They switched them over, so now when you dial in, the same number you've always dialed, you get WestNet instead of Mutiny. They've stolen all our users. They even cloned our interface, so most people  don't even know they're not on Mutiny. They think we changed the name. Okay, get on the Community forums and tell them they're not on Mutiny. What, they cloned the whole thing? Yes, everything, except games. Yeah, 'cause he realized Community is where the money was. Just tell them to log off and wait for us to find another network. Wait for us? Oh, Christ. I mean, why pay $5 million for us when they can just duplicate us and steal all of our users? Hello, hi, hi. This is Tom Rendon from Mutiny. Another company's taken over our network and I just... No, it looks like us, but it's not us. You need to log off. We'll be up again in... a week or two? Hello... damn it! Hello? They don't understand. They're still communicating with all the same users. All of their friends are on WestNet now. No, no, this isn't happening! (chatter) Joe : Where's Cameron? Something's happened and I need to talk to her. Where... where's Cameron? Where's Cameron? I got... I need to talk to her. Something's wrong. Uh, where's... where's Cameron? (chatter stops) I came straight here. I didn't know about this. I didn't know that this was happening. I had no idea that... Wheeler shut me out and... No, I... I'm... I'm moving to California. I... I gave my notice weeks ago. There's no reason I would've done this. I'm on your side. I wouldn't do this. I promise you, I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't do this. It's... it doesn't make any sense. There's this guy, Jesse... he did this. I don't... I mean, I didn't... damn it! Uh... (sighs) I don't even work there. I'm going to California. Cameron, I need you to hear me. You need to leave. No, you don't understand. Now, Joe. Gordon : Why would she be doing this? Why would she be doing this? Why would she be doing this? Do you believe him? Not for a second. Okay, so what are we gonna do now? Cameron, what are we gonna do now?
