 Come on. The sooner you fork it over, the sooner you can party. 
 I can't get it off. It's stuck. 
 Never mind. Keep it. 
 Oh, thank you. Thank you. 
 Don't thank me, thank El Cheapo here for buying cubic zirconium. 
 Now, this is real. 
 You may have our jewels, but you can't escape. 
 There's nowhere to go. 
 There's always down. 
 But we're 3000 feet up. 
 Isn't it cool? Bye. 
 There she is. 
 Bird One to base. Have sighted robbery suspect and she's falling fast. 
 Nothing we can do. Come to Roxy. Let's ride. Bird One to base. She's airborne. Repeat, she is airborne. I can play that game too, flyboys. We're gonna hit. About time. Fast men, fast planes. It's almost heaven. Let's burn. You got the skills, you've got the guts, but you just don't have the tools. Dead man flying. Thanks for a great first date. I'll call you. Trouble, sir? There's major damage to the right wing. Can you keep it aloft? I'll try... ...but I'm losing altitude fast. This is coming out of your allowance, Master Bruce. Roxy Rocket, a.k.a. Roxanne Sutton. She did all the stunts for Jennifer Westing in her action series. They say she doubled for some of the men too. She seems quite fearless. That was the problem. She began making stunts more dangerous than they needed to be. The danger of the work became more important than work itself. Finally, no company would insure her. She lost everything. I guess she's exacting some kind of revenge. Or she's still after the thrill. And now that she's had a taste of you... she's not gonna settle for anything less. One thing's for sure. She'll need a fence to get rid of the goods. I wanna know who it is. Late again, my felonious falcon. I heard you flew into a little trouble. No trouble. Just excitement. Besides, I think you'll find these worth the wait. Very nice. It ain't chicken feed. For your nest egg. High card? Double or nothing? Unlike you, my dear, I don't take unnecessary risks. Ten. Not hard to beat. I said, no. Oh, too bad. Nothing ventured... You worry me, my pippin. The chances you take. I want you to tone it down. And what? Spoil the fun? This isn't a movie, you know. I'm a legitimate businessman now. I don't want to draw attention to myself. I can't afford to have my associates getting Batman all excited. But he loved it. I know he lives for the chase, and I was the best he ever had. Ever been pursued by a bird of prey? Sorry, Pengie. Some things are just too scary, even for me. And after several weeks of competitive bidding... And a king's ransom. Wayne Industries is now the proud owner of Woman in Transition. Kind of small, though. My kid could've done better. Security seems kind of light, Lucius. Believe me, Bruce, it's covered. We've got guards posted at the main entrance and at all the elevators. No way anyone can get up here. Call security, right now. Now, if nobody gives me trouble, this will all be quick and painless. A bold statement. Energetic, forceful... and yet small enough to fit in a saddlebag. If you'll kindly step aside. I see you got my invitation. Let's rumba! 
 
 Come on, Rox. Pull up, pull up. You missed your calling, Batman. You should have been in the movies. Give it up, Roxy. I'm afraid that's not in my nature. Mine neither. That's what makes us a perfect couple. Catch! I hope it's good news. It is. I just found out who Roxy's silent partner is. Gotham's trendiest restaurateur. Penguin. Yeah. My sources tell me she's been seen at the Iceberg Lounge after hours. Way after hours. And you're sure your sources are good? Depends on your definition of good. But I trust them. You practically threw yourself into Batman's hands. If he catches you, what's to prevent him from making the connection to me? You would've put my whole operation at risk. Relax, Pengie. First, he's not gonna catch me. And second, I'm not a pigeon. I won't squawk. I've seen him crack tougher eggs than you. I'm sorry, my dear. I just can't take that chance. What's this? I assure you, it's not filled with birdseed. But I thought you liked me. I do. But an old bird like me can't afford such flights of fancy. Your famous luck has just run out. My way would've been so much more pleasant. What? As the heroine escapes through skylight, fade to black. If she sings to Batman, it could mean the end of everything I've built. I want her wings clipped. Permanently. I see you gave your muscle the night off. What's it to you? Could be dangerous. You never know who might drop in. What do you want? Roxy Rocket. I believe you've seen this. It's from the zeppelin robbery. That's right. I found it in your pocket. You never could resist keeping a bauble or two. Maybe you'd like to show me your search warrant as well. What say we have a little talk? Just like old times. So the old bird sent his chickens. Where'd she go? Bon voyage. This would be my cue to exit. Lights! Camera! Action! I love a man with staying power. Unfortunately, it's the third-act climax, and you're not in the final scene. Oh, you're good. I guess nothing lasts forever. What are you doing? Testing your true mettle, Batman. Jump now and you'll land in the water. And if I don't? You'll either crash into the canyon wall... or hit the ground ahead. So will you. Now you understand the game. Time is running out. Better make your move. I thought you enjoyed risk. Oh, baby, you're the best! The ultimate thrill. The final stunt. Me and you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! I knew it would be this way. The final stunt is the best. What? I get it. We live to play another day. What's this? My kind of game. And you lost.
