 What are you doing here? 
 Predawn. The dockyards. 
 Where else would a person in a mask be? 
 This is my gig. 
 If I needed you, I'd have called. 
 Smugglers? 
 Gunrunners out of South America. 
 The only cucumbers in those crates are.30 caliber. 
 And here come the bag boys now. 
 If you'll excuse me... 
 You're the one who raised him. 
 I saw him. 
 Didn't look like it. 
 Do you mind? 
 He's all yours. 
 I told you I didn't need... 
 A gift. 
 You said it. 
 A kiss? Why'd you let her go? 
 She didn't do anything except help. 
 Her kind of help you can do without. 
 Jealous? 
 What were you doing down by the docks anyway? 
 Just keeping my eye on things. 
 I heard rumors about this South American smuggling ring. 
 Word is something big is coming in, and soon. 
 Lf you'll excuse me... 
 There's safety in numbers, you know. 
 You and Bruce don't have to look out for me, Barb. I'm not stupid. 
 No, you just act that way sometimes. 
 You know how to lock up. 
 There's room for two on that thing. 
 Some other time. 
 Enrique El Gancho. Ricky the Hook. 
 Used to be an enforcer down in Colombia. 
 You're welcome, by the way. 
 I would've had the guy. 
 Maybe. 
 So, what are we doing here, anyway? 
 I'm following a lead. 
 Seems the Hook ran last night's show. 
 And you'd like to find out what else he's up to. 
 Something like that. 
 A patrol. Going to be tricky. 
 I'll tell you when we can move. 
 We? 
 I don't know what your angle is. 
 Why is it hard for you people... to accept that I've changed? 
 Doesn't anybody believe in redemption anymore? 
 Why come to me? 
 Who else would give me the chance? 
 Certainly not your boss. 
 He's not my boss. 
 Of course not. You're your own man now, aren't you? 
 Now! 
 Hey. 
 Next time, give me a little warning. 
 Sorry. This partner thing is new to me. 
 Who said anything about...? 
 Come on. 
 Here they are. His shipping schedules. 
 Good man. 
 Just have to transfer... There. 
 Let's go. 
 Catwoman? 
 What have we here? Batman Lite? 
 What are you doing? 
 Apparently getting set up by my new partner. 
 Partner? I think you've miscounted, my friend. 
 Thought I set you up? 
 It crossed my mind. 
 Now what? 
 Come on, let's get going. 
 Catch. 
 We're out of here. 
 
 
 
 So? 
 You did all right. 
 All right? I was brilliant. We were brilliant. 
 Yeah, I guess we were. 
 Need a ride? 
 Maybe next time. 
 Next time, then. 
 Hey, come on, guys. Have a little patience. 
 I'm only one woman. 
 I thought I felt a chill. 
 I want you to stay away from Nightwing. 
 Mother birds usually know when to let their robins leave the nest. 
 He's a big Boy Wonder now. A man Wonder, in fact. 
 I don't trust you, Selina. 
 Of course you don't. 
 That's why it never could have worked out between us. 
 Is this a private party? 
 Don't you men ever use the door? 
 Don't mind him. He wants to protect your honor. 
 I don't need a chaperone. 
 You don't know what she's capable of. 
 She's been straight with me. 
 Maybe you never gave her the chance. 
 If you don't trust me, Batman, trust him. 
 I guess I have to. 
 It's getting colder. Perhaps I should turn on the heat. 
 I... found something. 
 What's that? 
 On the disc. 
 Show me. 
 He keeps referring to a woman named Angelitos, Spanish for "little angels." 
 Now, look. 
 The shipping schedules. 
 Over here. A ship called Little Angels is due in today at Pier 21. 
 From Buenos Aires. 
 I think it's the big drop I've been hearing about all week. 
 I was looking for something to do tonight. What's wrong? 
 Yep. 
 There they are, keeping tabs on me like I was some kind of criminal. 
 Now you see what I go through. Here you go, precious. 
 Have a night on the town. 
 We shouldn't be bothered anymore. Wanna play? 
 Strange fruit. 
 He's smuggling artifacts. Looting his country's heritage for his own profit. 
 Catwoman? 
 What are you doing? 
 Just collecting what's mine. 
 The cat's-eye emerald. The Pearl of Argentina. 
 How's that yours? 
 I took it fair and square. 
 Getting it out of the country was another matter. 
 I knew about Enrique's smuggling operation. 
 So you slipped it into one of his shipments. 
 My only problem was figuring out when the shipment was coming in. 
 You played me for a sap. 
 But such a sweet sap. 
 The money the cat's-eye will bring is enough to take us anywhere. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 I guess not. 
 But you can't blame a girl for trying. 
 Hey! 
 And I really liked you too. 
 Nice way of showing it. 
 You all right? 
 Just brokenhearted. 
 She led us right to the emerald, like you said. 
 You set me up. 
 Afraid so. 
 Well, well. Must be time to fumigate again. 
 Not bad. 
 Yeah, for a guy your age. 
 He's all yours. 
 Thanks. 
 The great Batman has met his match, no? 
 No. 
 Say good night, pigeon. 
 You all right? 
 You know me. 
 Always happy to have a little help.
