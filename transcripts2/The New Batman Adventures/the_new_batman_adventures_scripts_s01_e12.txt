 Bruce Wayne! Stop where you are! 
 Fire! 
 The hangar. Go. 
 Fall back. 
 Move it. Let's go. 
 Batman! Don't. 
 We are gonna die. 
 Oh, no, Wayne. No vanishing act this time No! 
 Alfred. 
 Keep going, sir. Keep going. 
 Knock it off, Jeeves. I'm warning you. 
 Bring your craft to an immediate halt. This is your only warning. 
 Again. 
 Yeah. 
 I never thought it would end this way. For us or for Barbara. 
 I still don't know everything that happened. 
 I'll never forget. 
 I can see it as clearly as my parents' murder. 
 Scarecrow had seized control of city hall. 
 While we polished off his goons, the maniac ran. 
 Barbara went after him. No! Oh, man. Lie still. Call an ambulance! Dad? Barbara? Oh, my God. No! Dad, I... Jim. How could you? I worked with you, trusted you. And you never told me? She was my daughter. My daughter. That's as far as you go, murderer. Playtime's over, freak. Lose the belt. Lose the mask. Now. I said, now. Batman, come on. Get him! Seal the building. No one gets in or out. I want SWAT teams in place, helicopter backup. Harvey! We both know we'll never catch him. Not that way. So, what do we do? What I should've done years ago. Yes? Wayne. Commissioner? What can I do for you? Drop the act. Ten minutes on Barbara's computer told me everything. Like a fool, I allowed you to run wild on your private crusade. A psychotic misfit playing masked hero. Now I've paid for it with Barbara's life. Jim, believe me. I know how you feel. You can't. You know how I lost my parents. The only way I could hold onto my sanity... was to take matters into my own hands. That makes us even. Merciful heavens. This is not good. I'm sorry. Hit it again! Everything gone. Just like that. Now what? You're kidding. No, he's right. Until we work out our next move, this is it. But we'll need supplies and equipment. I'm going. It's too dangerous. I've got everything we need at my loft. I'll be in and out before the cops ever find the place. Freeze! Richard Grayson, you have the right to remain silent. Waived. Dick Grayson, also known as Nightwing, was arrested last night...  in a fiery shootout in lower Gotham. Though rigorously questioned by police...  Grayson refused to reveal the whereabouts of the Batman...  now known to be billionaire Bruce Wayne. Police Commissioner James Gordon is spearheading the citywide manhunt... They've got him downtown. I figure we break in, take out the guards... and spring Nightwing and Alfred together. No. What do you mean? It's over, Tim. Gordon feels betrayed, and maybe he was. He won't give up until he gets me. You have to leave me now. Give yourself up. No one will blame you for what happened. What about you? I don't know. My heart goes out to you, Jim, believe me. Lf it had been my child... It wasn't. No. And while I feel for your loss... you have to realize how bad this makes us look. Yes, Batman has helped the city, but he still operates outside the law. We've looked the other way before... but now that everyone knows your daughter was part of his team... What are you saying? The DA's office wants a full investigation. They want you to step down. How's it look for the old man? 
 
 Not good. Get a load of this. Enemies of society or victims of a revenge-crazed vigilante? You decide on Gotham Exposed. I have such horrible dreams. Every night there's a gigantic black figure chasing me. His eyes, blazing like fire. I try to run, but there's no escape. He grabs me and... The truth is, none of us would've turned to crime if it had not been for Batman. We were helpless, lost souls, crying out for understanding. What we got was a beating from a self-righteous madman. Our civil rights were clearly abused. Now that we finally know the face behind the mask...  we demand justice. We demand satisfaction. We demand money. Yeah! Quite so. On advice from legal counsel, we have launched a billion-dollar lawsuit. If the bat's on a spree, Wayne must pay the fee. Disgusting. I'm sorry, Jim, that's the way it has to be. Commish? I can either hand my badge in now, or wait until the grand jury roasts me. Either way, I lose Batman. We have something in common now. You hate Batman almost as much as I do. Help me get him and I can strike a deal on your sentence. They haven't fired me yet. Do we have an agreement? No sign of him yet, commissioner. Keep your eyes open. I know he's here. Barbara. Got him. Do it. Commissioner! Stay on him. Bane. I'm pleased you remember me, Mr. Wayne. You can't believe how I've looked forward to this. Though I was hoping for more of a fight. But what could I expect from a killer of children? You would fight to the death? It makes no difference now. There's no place to run, Wayne. Good. I want to finish him slowly. I want him alive. Alive, to rot away in Arkham. Surrounded by the monsters he's created. Poetic, but no. We had a deal. Thought about it. Didn't work for me. Please, give your dear Barbara a kiss from me. Time to die. You first. Please, Jim. For Barbara. No. No. No! No! No! She's waking up. Thank goodness. How do you feel? Terrible. Thank God you're not dead. Is that what you saw? You and my father, at each other's throats... because I was killed without ever telling him... about this. Your deepest fear brought to life by The Scarecrow. He gassed you right before we nailed him. You've been out all night. It seemed so real. To you, it was. I've ignored this fear for too long. I have to deal with it. I understand. Keep cooking like that, you'll have me looking like Harvey. Dinner wasn't the only reason I wanted to see you tonight. Dad, have a seat. This is important. It won't be easy for you to hear... but it's about a job I took on recently. Barbara, please. Sweetheart, you're capable of making your own decisions. You don't need me to approve or even acknowledge them. And in this case, I can't. All you need to know is I love you. All of you. And that is all I have to say on the subject. Daddy.
