 This is the Yoorana Police. Can you come over here, please? 
 What's happened? 
 I have no idea... but there's more than one of them. 
 It's alright, I'm a doctor. 
 I found another one. 
 So there's five. 
 Beau : There were a bunch of you coming out of coffins! 
 Coffins? What? 
 Her name's Kate. 
 You can't be Kate. 
 We're married. 
 First mayor of Yoorana. 
 That's me, I'm the mayor! 
 Do you know when you were born? 
 March 2nd, 1931. 
 When did you die? 
 Die? 
 He was trespassing. Are you gonna write it up? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 You don't have to tell me how to do my job, Vic. 
 Your eye's bleeding. He decomposed in front of me. 
 I'm asking you to keep this between us. 
 Is this gonna happen to Kate? 
 I wanna sleep in my own bed. 
 ♪ Theme music James? 
 Hi, honey. 
 Hey. 
 Did you have someone in the tank? 
 Um, no, no. Just call-outs. 
 It's moving. 
 Yeah. 
 Come to bed, it's Chris's shift. 
 I have to do a committal report. 
 Boring. 
 I know, I'm sorry. I just wanted to see you. 
 Why have you got that face on? 
 Do I have a face on? 
 You've got serious face on. 
 Oh, do I? I didn't mean to. 
 OK. 
 Right, I gotta go. 
 Love you. 
 I had breast cancer, didn't I? 
 They gave me a mastectomy. 
 That's right. 
 I remember waking up after the operation. 
 James was there. 
 Stayed with me in the hospital room. 
 I remember feeling so sorry for him. 
 He didn't deserve this. 
 Neither did you. 
 But now I'm back and so are my breasts. 
 And my cancer, what about that? 
 And good news. 
 No irregularities. 
 Course, you'd need a mammogram to be really sure you're clear. 
 Alright, now I feel perfectly fine. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Dr McKellar. 
 Fine. 
 Meet me at the cemetery. 
 'OK, I'll see you there.' 
 Is that James? 
 Yeah, something I have to help him with. 
 Do you want me to come with you? 
 That wouldn't be a good idea. 
 Why not? 
 Because everyone who knows you thinks you're dead. 
 I need you to stay here and look after the others. 
 James? 
 Hey. I checked up on Alexandro Nico Carlo's brother. 
 He died last night, at 11:50. 
 At the same time all this happened? 
 Well, we don't know exactly when this happened. 
 Well, it's close enough. 
 Alexander was old, he was suffering from a range of complications. 
 So, you think that's a coincidence. 
 I'm saying there'll be a rational explanation. 
 Elishia, I watched a man disintegrate in front of me last night. 
 Can you explain that? 
 (Sighs) 
 Six graves disturbed, only five people. 
 A list of names and dates, there must be another one. 
 We need to look for them. 
 No, actually, we need to fix this. 
 Otherwise there'll be an investigation. 
 (Crows caw) 
 (Insects hum) 
 Yoorana 102. 
 Man, on radio : Yeah. Some guy over at the high school, naked, 'acting crazy.' 
 Yeah, OK, I'll take it. 
 Let's go. 
 No, no. You should get back to the surgery. 
 Is this another one? 
 It's just a hole. Empty. 
 Nothing. 
 The girls said he ran in here when they came in for training. 
 So, he's still in there? 
 That's the only door to the female change room. 
 (OK then.) 
 Keep them back, please. 
 This one? 
 Patrick Fitzgerald? 
 Look, I know you're probably very confused right now, but I am here to help you. 
 If you can just come out now, I can take you somewhere safe. 
 It's OK. 
 I'm just gonna open this door now, nice and slowly -- 
 I don't want any trouble. 
 (Grunts) 
 It's alright. It's alright. I don't want to hurt you. 
 I don't want to hurt you. 
 (Grunts) 
 (Yelps) 
 (Howls) 
 Don't resist. 
 That's it. 
 OK. 
 Alright. Up we come. 
 (Grunts) 
 I got you. 
 Stand back, girls, please. 
 Man, on TV : 'According to eye-witnesses, we are being watched.' 
 Woman, on TV : 'I urge everyone to remain calm.' 
 '(Scream)' 
 'That didn't work out so well.' 
 'This is a problem.' 
 Woman, on TV : 'A big problem.' 
 What'd he say? 
 Um... it's cartoons. 
 TV : 'Sinister forces are out there, friends.' 
 'You must be prepared.' 
 Boy, on TV : 'For what?' 
 'Thieves who pull the wool over your eyes and the carpet under your feet.' 
 '(Giggles)' 
 It's TV. 
 (Woman groans) 
 (Continues groaning) 
 Woman : Have you hurt yourself? 
 Help us! 
 Let me help you up. 
 Get off me! 
 Get off me. 
 It's OK. It's OK. 
 (Groans) 
 Just sit down. Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh. 
 Leave it alone. 
 I'm just gonna take the dressing off. 
 I'll be gentle. 
 (Groans) 
 What's wrong? 
 The leg wound, it's infected. 
 She's on amoxicillin. 
 Well, it's not working. 
 She should be in the hospital. 
 Possibly. 
 Well, then, why aren't we taking her? 
 Do you remember anything about how you got there? 
 Remember the cemetery? 
 You look too young to be Patrick Fitzgerald. 
 What? 
 Alright, listen. 
 I have to talk to somebody, so be quiet in here. 
 Alright? 
 It's all done here, mate. 
 Ah, Vic, I thought you'd be back in Echuca by now. 
 Felt like I'd be more useful here. 
 Well, I appreciate, ah, the help, mate, but we can handle this. 
 Doesn't look to me like you're handling anything at the moment. 
 Sorry, what's that mean? 
 The guy I brought in last night, breaking into Noregard -- 
 Carlo, the Italian -- he's not in a lock-up, there's no record of interview. 
 We brought a translator in and I decided not to charge him. 
 He had no ID. 
 No way of us tracking him, so, what, you just... you just cut him loose? 
 That was my call, yeah. 
 (Snorts) 
 Well, he probably did that. 
 The pub was busted into last night too. 
 (Banging from inside police Jeep) 
 Who've you got in there? 
 Just a... just a local guy D and D. Just giving him a lift home. 
 He doesn't sound too happy about it. 
 Listen, Vic, I don't tell you how to run your patch, don't come here and tell me how to run mine. 
 (Engine revs) 
 (Jeep beeps) 
 (Birds chirp) 
 Hey, china? 
 Hey, china! 
 (Grunts) What? 
 Don't sneak up on me like that. 
 My name's Paddy. 
 You really went to town, hey, Paddy? 
 Not bad, eh? What do you think? 
 The cops are all over -- two of 'em -- just down in Fitzgerald Street. 
 Fitzgerald Street? You see? 
 Wouldn't even exist without me. 
 If I need something, I take it. 
 Now that I'm suitably attired, you can escort me to my chambers. 
 I got school. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Natives at school, huh? 
 (Birds chirp) 
 (Horn honks) 
 Alright, out you come. Out you come. 
 Swing a leg. That's the way. 
 Who's he? 
 Ah, I don't know. He's not talking. 
 Is he one of us? 
 I think so. 
 You know that hole you found? 
 Take a seat. 
 What's your name? 
 (Sighs) 
 'John Doe', it is then. 
 OK, as you know, we found you all in the cemetery last night. 
 Early this morning Elishia and I went back to have a look at the disturbed graves, and the holes in the graves... there's no way they were dug from the outside. 
 What? So, someone dug their way out? 
 Judgement Day. 
 'The dead in Christ will rise first.' 
 I would say that was impossible, except... this is Kate, she's my wife, and she has been dead for over two years. 
 (Gasps) 
 She was buried in that cemetery. 
 (Scoffs) 
 The other graves were older, but the ages of the people listed on the tombstones match up with you. 
 Charles Thompson, 21 years old when he died. 
 Thompson. Yeah. 
 Thompson, that's my last name. 
 (Girl Scoffs) 
 If it is, you've been dead for almost 100 years. 
 What? 
 Holy mother of God. 
 (Gasps) 
 Maria Rose Massola -- died in 1969, aged 39. 
 No. My name's Anna, Anna Massola, I'm sure of it. 
 This is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard. 
 It's not. 
 He's telling the truth. 
 What, that we're back from the dead? You don't believe this sh1t, do you? 
 I don't know. I was cold and wet. 
 Yeah, we've all got amnesia or something like that. 
 No. 
 I remember. I don't... 
 (Sighs) Not everything, but enough. 
 Do you remember dying? Because... I don't seem to recall that, and I feel like something like that'd stay with me if it happened, which it didn't! 
 You know he's right. 
 You examined us, do we look like zombies? 
 No. 
 There was another headstone damaged, no surname. 
 She was 19 years old when she died in '88. 
 First name was Kirsten. 
 Missed by her sister Janice. 
 Does that mean anything to you? 
 No-one calls me 'Kirsten', it's Kirstie. 
 And... Carlo. 
 Yes, he matched up with a headstone too. 
 Where is he? 
 Last night, shortly after he left here, he died. 
 Again? 
 Is that gonna happen to us? 
 Well, based on the examinations I carried out, you all appear to be in perfect health. So did Carlo. 
 We don't yet know why he died. 
 (Grunts) 
 Yeah? Well, Kirstie needs to get to a hospital now. 
 You'll be alright. That's it. Come through. 
 Watch out. 
 (Grunts) 
 What are you gonna say? 
 I'll say I found her outside town and Kirstie can tell them she doesn't remember what happened. 
 There'll be extensive testing. 
 Which is actually what we need. 
 Well, I need the keys to your handcuffs. 
 No. 
 Well, if there's an emergency I'll have to remove them. 
 Alright, but only in an emergency. 
 I want to come. 
 No, mate, this is easier if I do it alone. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 (Sighs) Alright. 
 You didn't tell me about Carlo. 
 I didn't want to scare you. 
 The truth from now on, OK? 
 I won't be gone long. 
 Then can we go home? 
 You 'right? 
 Freakin' out a bit, but... 
 (Chuckles).. yeah, we're alright. 
 Will they take her leg off? 
 No, why do you ask that? 
 Blood poisoning. Isn't that what they do? 
 No. No. 
 They'll give her antibiotics. She'll be fine. 
 What's that? 
 Oh, she's bleedin'. 
 So are you. 
 (Groans, retches) 
 sh1t. 
 (Both groan) 
 (Jeep beeps) 
 (Groans) 
 Look at me. You're OK. 
 We're OK. 
 (Banging on door) 
 Can you go into the exam room until I call you? 
 Come on. Quickly. 
 I only want to help you. 
 Please, can you go in and be quiet? 
 (Banging on door) 
 Please? 
 Thank you. 
 Doctor McKellar. 
 Yes? 
 I'm Senior Sergeant Dick Eastley. 
 Just wanted to have a chat about that business over at the cemetery last night. 
 Oh, I'm with a patient. 
 Well, I can wait inside. 
 I'm sorry, that wouldn't be appropriate. 
 What, because you're with a patient? 
 Exactly. 
 Right. 
 (Snorts) 
 (Chuckles) 
 Oh, I'll... I'll get back to you, then. 
 And you can find a time when it is appropriate. 
 My name is Anna. 
 Why did that policeman say my name was Maria? 
 Because it was on your headstone. 
 I want to see it. 
 sh1t. 
 Maria! 
 He's gone. 
 Thank you, for, um... staying quiet. 
 (Sighs) 
 I'm sorry, I promised I wouldn't. 
 Am I in hell? 
 No. 
 No, you're alive. 
 And... and you're in Yoorana. Do you know Yoorana? 
 No. 
 That's me. 
 Anna. 
 That's my baby. 
 Oh, no. 
 I'm so sorry, Maria. 
 Oh, no, no, no. She's in here. She can't get out! 
 She's still here! 
 She can't get out, she's trapped! 
 She's trapped! No! 
 She's not in there. 
 (Sobs) 
 I'm so sorry. 
 We can't stay here. 
 Oh, no. 
 Come on. Come with me. 
 Come on. 
 No! 
 Come with me. 
 My house is nearby. 
 It's OK. 
 What happened? 
 You need to get them in and check them out straight away, please. 
 Alright. 
 Alright, you got them? 
 Yep. 
 (Dogs bark in distance) 
 Everything's normal. 
 
 
 
 Elishia? 
 We got to the bridge, the exact same spot as Carlo, and it happened again both of them were bleeding from the eyes. 
 Maybe there's something on the bridge something toxic to them. 
 No, because I backed up. 
 We headed up by the North Road and the same thing happened again. 
 Well, how far out of town did you get? 
 I don't know, maybe 5-6km? 
 We need to tell everyone. 
 We need to make sure they stay close to town, OK? 
 What? 
 Sergeant Eastley came by this morning asking questions. 
 And I told Kate and Maria to hide, and when I came back they'd gone. 
 This is... 
 I was going to run my sheep through here. 
 Can you believe that? 
 Not now you ain't. 
 It was away from all the digging, you see? You know? 
 The mining. 
 Is that how you got rich? 
 What? No, it's not. 
 So, I took one look at them down there, digging in the mud, and you know what I said? 
 He says, 'Paddy, you can go down there on your hands and knees and break your back in that muck or you can stay up here and sell the poor bastards everything they need -- supplies, equipment, tools, food, gambling, women, rum laced with opium.' 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You name it and I sold it. 
 All for a nice, tidy little profit too. 
 Yeah. 
 How can you exchange that? 
 Made a fortune. 
 A bloody fortune. 
 And the time has come now for me to go and get it back. 
 So, I must take my leave from you now. 
 And I thank you for your company. 
 (Crickets chirp) 
 Where am I? 
 This isn't my bloody chambers. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Train horn blows) 
 Why would God take my little girl? 
 I was a nurse, I saw it. 
 A lot of bad things happened to good people. 
 Eventually, you just stop asking why. 
 Why bring me back and not her? 
 Maybe it wasn't God. 
 (Birds chirp) 
 All I know is that I'm grateful to be here. 
 Of course you are. 
 You have your home, your husband. 
 (Sighs) 
 Maybe your husband's still in town. 
 Maybe you still have family here, Maria. 
 Here's my place. 
 How do we get in? 
 (Sighs) 
 (Door creaks open) 
 The furniture's all changed. 
 We used to have the couch over there. 
 I mean... I actually think it looks better that way. 
 Did you want some clothes? 
 Bound to be something in here. 
 These aren't mine. 
 (Sighs) 
 That's my friend. That's... 
 That's Sarah. 
 (Sighs) 
 I'm sorry, Kate. 
 (Sighs) 
 Look how good he.... 
 Oh, sh1t. (Sobs) 
 Spongey! Hey, girl! Hello. 
 (Door opens) 
 Someone's here. 
 Quick. 
 Quick, quick! 
 James? 
 (Both pant) 
 Smudge? 
 I'm a police officer, can you step out? 
 Kate, wait! 
 (Gasps) 
 Stop following me! 
 Why do you yell at me? 
 I didn't do this to you? 
 (Groans) I know. 
 Where are you going? 
 Anywhere but here! 
 (Dial tone) 
 Sarah? 
 James, I just got home. There was someone in the house. 
 Wait, wait, wait. What? 
 They went out through the back door. 
 Did you see them? 
 No, but they were in the house when I came in. 
 I don't know what they've taken yet. 
 OK, get out of the house now. 
 No, it's alright, they've gone. 
 (Sighs) I could have chased them if I wasn't a f*cking human walrus. 
 No, no, listen. Just stay inside, lock the doors. Are you OK? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 And call Chris -- now. 
 OK. OK. 
 OK. 
 Walya! 
 Yooweeai! 
 Walya! 
 What...? 
 Walya! 
 Ah! f*ck ya! 
 Walya! 
 Ah! Get away from me! 
 Get away from me! Get away from me, you black! 
 Get away from me! 
 Get away from me, you black b*st*rd! 
 You're a murdering b*st*rd! You murdered me! 
 Paddy! Paddy! 
 You murdered me! 
 You murdered me! 
 I didn't touch you! 
 You... Not you. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 I remembered. I was attacked. 
 Laid out, I was... 
 (Pants).. by one of them blackfellas. 
 (Sighs) Must have been some sort of payback. 
 I didn't live in the town. 
 I built an estate. 
 Corona Hill. 
 Have you any idea how far away that would be? 
 Past my house 4km that way. 
 4km. 
 That is...? 
 About an hour's walk? 
 Better shake a leg. 
 Thank you kindly. 
 Maria. Where are you going? 
 Anna was my daughter. She's not coming back. 
 Where is Kate? 
 (Sighs) She's gone. 
 She's leaving town, and she knows... about you and Sarah. 
 Get off the road, alright? 
 The surgery is back down there to the left. 
 I don't care if there's an earthquake or a f*ckin' tsunami, you get back there and don't leave again. 
 (Barks) 
 I'm so sorry. I meant to tell you. 
 When? 
 Please, stop. 
 It's alright, you've got Sarah now. 
 You were dead. I thought you were dead. 
 You said I died two years ago. 
 How long did you wait till you hooked up with her? 
 (Sighs) 
 Just f*cking tell me! 
 We've been married for six months. 
 (Groans) 
 What about the baby? 
 It's due in two weeks. 
 Oh! Were you f*cking her while I was alive? 
 No! No! 
 Am I supposed to believe that? 
 That's the truth. 
 (Groans) Oh, God. 
 Well, it worked out well for you, didn't it? 
 Not like I could give you any kids. 
 How can you say that? 
 My life ended when you died. 
 Then why her? Why my best friend? 
 Because she was in as much pain as I was. 
 Yeah, right... (Groans) 
 What's wrong? What's wrong? 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 You let go of me! 
 Oh, my God! Come back! Come back! 
 Listen to me. Listen to me. 
 I've seen this happen already. 
 Come on. 
 I want to get out! 
 Get off me! 
 Come on, come on. 
 Come on. 
 It's OK. It's OK. 
 (Magpies caw) 
 Thanks for showing up. 
 We can't protect these people. I'm gonna tell Vic. 
 No! 
 No. What if he decides to move them out of town? 
 No, I'll tell him that's not safe. 
 And what if he doesn't believe you? 
 Well, I'll... Whatever the problem, I'll deal with it. 
 You're right. 
 You're right, we need a solution. 
 Are you alright? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. How's Sarah? 
 She's all good. 
 Hey. 
 Yeah? 
 I told him to piss off back to Echuca, but he said he's the division supervisor. 
 Yeah, he is. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Mate, I can't help you if I don't know what's happening. 
 I'll tell you later, Chris. 
 Hello, James. What are you doing? 
 Oh, that damage at the cemetery, someone's straightened it all out. 
 Spoke to the trustees -- they didn't do it. 
 In fact, it hadn't even been reported to them. 
 I did it. 
 So I figured. 
 I need to know that I can trust you. 
 That if I tell you something, you won't tell anyone else. 
 Mate, if you've broken the law... 
 No, it's nothing like that. 
 OK, so what is it like? 
 (Exhales) 
 The people that we found at the cemetery the other night... they were dead. 
 And they were buried there. 
 And they've come back to life. 
 One of them was Kate -- my wife, Kate. 
 Kate? 
 You really believe this? 
 It's true. 
 Mate, I tell you what, why don't you just go home and... 
 No, no, I know how it sounds. 
 .. have a rest? 
 No, I know how it sounds. 
 .. I'll finish up. 
 Vic, I know how it... 
 I'll go back to Echuca, make a few phone calls and... see what we can do to help, and then I'll just come back. 
 I'm not crazy. 
 sh1t. 
 (Dogs bark, birds whistle) 
 This place belonged to my aunt and uncle. 
 You should be safe here. 
 From what? 
 Everything. 
 And everyone. 
 I think there's still some clothes in the cupboard. 
 So I'll get some food in. 
 (Phone rings) 
 James? 
 Where are you? 
 Don't worry, they're with me. We're OK. 
 Where? 
 Somewhere safe. 
 Kate is my wife. 
 And yesterday you begged me to keep this a secret. 
 And now I'm telling you it's enough. 
 This is too important to be left to the police. 
 You know what? I've told Vic. 
 This is more important to me than to anyone. 
 This event could completely transform biological science. 
 What, so this is some sort of f*cking experiment to you? 
 No, they're my patients and I have a duty to protect them. 
 Elishia... 
 Elishia?! 
 I think it's looking better. 
 Well, it's not worse, and that's a good thing. 
 Where are Kate and Maria? 
 Outside. 
 I'm so sorry I left you on your own. 
 We've both been tested. 
 Yeah. 
 Perhaps that's why God's chosen us for these tests. 
 I don't really believe in God. 
 How can you not believe in God... when the miracle happened to you? 
 (Grunts) 
 Hi. 
 Hey. Sorry, I got... 
 I got caught up again. 
 I can't sleep. It's too hot. 
 Chris said he came around. 
 Yeah, I can handle it. 
 Yeah, I know you can, but I'm sorry. 
 I don't think they took anything -- maybe I interrupted them. 
 But I can't find the dog. 
 She'll turn up. 
 What are you doing with the uniform? 
 Just... muddy. Thought I'd wash it now. 
 Didn't want to bother you. 
 OK. 
 I gotta... take those off. Would you like that? 
 (Grunts) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Winces, yelps) 
 (Gasps) 
 (Chokes) 
 (Grunts) 
 (Gasps) 
 I'm sorry. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Woman : Hello? 
 Yeah, it's me. 
 Well, thanks for calling. 
 You on your way home? 
 Well, I'm gonna drop by the station first and make a few calls. 
 Of course you are. 
 Well, I'll see you in the morning. 
 OK. Bye. 
 (Radio crackles) 
 (Horn beeps) 
 (Radio crackles) 
 (Eerie chanting on radio) 
 (Groans) 
 Ah. 
 (Groans) 
 (Pants) 
 Vic? What happened? 
 Just a bit of an accident. 
 We have to find an exit. We can't hide you in Yoorana forever. 
 I've got something hidden here -- something important. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Doctor McKellar has taken them somewhere. 
 I need to find them. 
 Yeah, I'm trying to find them Vic. 
 Are you doing OK? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought it was empty. 
 It's not empty, mate. 
 It's his house. 
 I'm Rory Fitzgerald. 
 My husband's gone too. 
 He's still here. 
 Maria Massola? 
 Room 237. 
 I can take you to him if you can take me to Kate. 
 Don't push him! 
 (Car horn beeps) 
 You need to leave this with me now.
