 Don't push him! 
 Man : So There's no way out of Yoorana? 
 None that I can find. 
 And who asked you to find one?! 
 Would someone like to tell me what's going on? 
 Beau : We didn't take anything. 
 'We'? Who else are you here with? 
 I bought this place after you died. 
 It's beautiful. 
 James is at work still. Some dickhead's been on a robbery spree it seems. 
 You think that's related to the business at the cemetery? 
 What business? 
 What's he doing here? 'Cause we don't know anything about him! 
 He could have been a killer! 
 Elishia : That's enough. 
 No, seriously! Say something! 
 (John growls) 
 I don't belong here. 
 You will remember who you are. 
 I know what I am. 
 No, no, no! 
 Mama? 
 Anna? 
 (Car horn blares, tyres screech) 
 (Screaming) 
 Anna, my darling, forgive me. 
 Maria, I'm here to help. 
 ♪ Theme music ♪ 
 (Gasps) 
 (Cries) 
 I don't know what to do anymore. 
 Well, first up we need to get you all some proper medical attention away from Yoorana. 
 Dr McKellar's been looking after us. 
 Dr McKellar's been lying to you. 
 Why would she do that? 
 If she's the one who can figure out how you've come back... it's the most valuable scientific discovery in history. 
 But we can't leave. There's a barrier. 
 She said that we can't cross it. 
 (Snorts) Have you seen it? 
 No, but the others got sick and James warned us to stay away. 
 Well, James wouldn't lie. 
 But that doctor, she's clever. 
 She could have been the one who made them sick. 
 Whose grave were you at? 
 My daughter, Anna. 
 She died in the car accident with me. 
 She was ten. 
 Too young. 
 But if the right doctors and scientists could work out why you came back... they may be able to do the same for her. 
 Bring my Anna back? 
 We have to at least try, don't we? 
 Yes. Yes, we do. 
 Then we have to find the others, get them to the right people, and then see what we can do. 
 I need to speak to someone first. 
 (Techno music thuds distantly) 
 You alright? 
 Sounds like they're shelling us. 
 It's just a party, you dickhead. 
 Come on. We need a drink. 
 (Techno music blares) 
 It's a paddock party. 
 How you going? 
 OK if I grab a drink? 
 Man : Help yourself. 
 Hey. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Techno music track changes) 
 I f*cking love this song! 
 (Whistling) 
 Man : Alright! 
 (Car horn beeps) 
 (Whistling and catcalling) 
 Man : Come on, I want a go! 
 What are you doing? 
 Don't. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Want a slug? 
 Is she your girlfriend? 
 No. 
 Bit of a slut, I reckon. 
 Do you want a beer? I got a heap in my car. 
 I got pot too. 
 (Car horn beeps) 
 No. 
 Kirstie?! 
 Piss off, mate. 
 Kirstie? 
 (Sighs) 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. 
 We are married. 
 Do you want to come inside? 
 Uh... it's pretty late. I should go. 
 Sure. 
 Kirstie! I've lost her! 
 Man : Nothing like this in the city. 
 Kirstie : Yeah. Are you from there? 
 I'm a Yoorana boy, born and bred. Probably die here. 
 Me too. 
 I've never seen you before. 
 Nice one. 
 Come on. 
 Come on! 
 You want me to do this? 
 Yeah. 
 (Gasps) 
 Hey! Get off her! Step away! 
 I didn't do anything! 
 You mongrel! 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Back off! Charlie! Enough! Get off! 
 Come here. 
 What's going on? 
 She asked me to, I swear. 
 Bullshit! 
 Hey, enough! Charlie! 
 Let him go! 
 Kirstie, is that true? 
 Alright, get out of here. Go... go! 
 Let me help you. 
 Get off me! 
 Get back to Elishia's now. 
 Now. Go, Charlie. 
 What the hell was that about? 
 I was murdered. 
 By who, Kirstie? Someone you knew? 
 I don't remember. 
 If something like that did happen, there will be police records, and I can find them. 
 We can try and figure out who you are and track down your family. 
 Really? 
 I'll do what I can, I promise. 
 (Ringing tone) 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 John's gone. 
 Gone? What you just let him go? 
 No, I tried to stop him. I couldn't. 
 You should have called me! 
 You were with Kate, weren't you? 
 Listen, I'm gonna find out what I can about Kirstie's death. 
 What now? 
 She thinks she was murdered. Maybe there's something in that. 
 How is that relevant? Maria is missing, John is gone. 
 I have no idea where they are. 
 (Elishia huffs on phone) 
 (Call disconnects) 
 Hey, mate, what are you doing? 
 I'm thirsty. 
 Get out now. 
 Go on, piss off! 
 Arggh! Oh! 
 (Woman whimpers) 
 Hey. I thought you were asleep. 
 It's morning. I tend to wake up then. 
 Did you have another all-nighter? 
 Um... no, it was a domestic. 
 It just took some time to resolve it. 
 Hey, Vic came by last night. 
 Did he? What did he want? 
 Wanted to talk to you. 
 He was quite weird, actually. 
 Yeah the accident, he hit his head. 
 I think it's rattled him a little bit. 
 Yeah, right. He said something about the cemetery. 
 Yeah, what? 
 That someone had been interfering with the graves. 
 Yeah, I've been dealing with that. 
 Whose grave was it? 
 Um, Kirstie someone? Died in the '80s. 
 Kirstie? 
 Yeah, she was young, like, 19. 
 Was it Kirstie Darrow? 
 Do you know her? 
 I mean, I know OF her. 
 She was murdered. It was big news at the time. 
 How? 
 She was strangled. 
 She was found naked down by the lake. It was horrible. 
 Did they catch the guy, do you know? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Oh, God, that's awful, someone would do that to her grave. 
 Yeah, it's horrible. 
 Well, I hope you sort it out. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Yeah? 
 I've got my last ultrasound with Dr McKellar today. 
 Do you reckon you could make it? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm there. 
 And then afterwards, do you wanna just, um, come back here and just talk? 
 So, you reckon you never saw any of the signs? 
 Beau. 
 So, what you just opened the door and walked in? 
 Well, you are lucky the Fitzgeralds aren't gonna lay a complaint. 
 Arseholes. 
 Beau! 
 You won't get a record, but any more cheek from you and you'll end up in detention, you understand me? 
 There is one other thing I'd like to talk to Beau about. 
 Really? What else has he done? 
 The supermarket was held up on Wednesday night. 
 Now, we know Beau was there. 
 Now, the man we're looking for is in his mid-50s. 
 If Beau can tell me what he knows about that bloke...? 
 I don't f*cking know nothing about him. 
 Really? 
 Based on the CCTV footage we have, I could consider treating you as an accomplice in the matter. 
 And that would definitely mean a stay in juvenile detention. 
 You won't believe me. 
 Try me. 
 You know that old statue on Clark Street? 
 The one with bird sh1t all over it? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that's him. 
 Thanks. 
 Thought it was your day off, mate. 
 Yeah, it is. I'm just catching up on paperwork. 
 Vic still on your back, is he? 
 No. Is he still in town? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought you spoke to him. He took a vehicle out yesterday. 
 Right, OK, what else have I missed here? 
 Well... I just had Beau McRea in here copping a very stern warning. 
 Why? What did he do? 
 He was caught mucking around in the old Fitzgerald house. 
 Fitzgerald? 
 Yeah. 
 I figured while I had him in the hot seat, I'd quiz him about the supermarket job the other night. 
 Oh, right! Yeah, and? 
 Kid's a total smart-arse. 
 Why? What did he say? 
 That our crim is Patrick Fitzgerald, first mayor of Yoorana. 
 He's got a theme going, at least. 
 And did he say where the good mayor's at now? 
 Well, he's not in his chambers. 
 Ha! 
 No, he's camping down by the old creek at Dodson Road. 
 OK, right. I'll check that out. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 That'd be great. 
 OK. 
 You're early... 
 Leon, my love. 
 There's something you need to hear. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I shouldn't have driven the car that night. 
 I wasn't ready to drive. 
 But I was so angry. 
 You accused me of such horrible things. 
 And I didn't know that Anna was in the back. 
 I didn't see her. She must have snuck in. 
 (Sobs) 
 Oh, you have to understand me. 
 Anna? 
 Yes! Yes. Our Anna. 
 We can bring her back. This man here, he's gonna help us. 
 Everyone is gone. 
 No. I'm here. 
 And Anna can have a second chance too. 
 Jealous. 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 I'm sorry, Maria. 
 We have to leave. We have to find the others. 
 I'll be back as soon as I can, and I'm gonna bring Anna with me, and we're gonna be a family again. 
 OK? 
 (Kisses) 
 Hello? 
 Anybody here? 
 State your purpose. 
 Patrick Michael Fitzgerald? 
 What's it to you, trapper? 
 I'm James Hayes. 
 I was at the cemetery the night you came back. 
 I'm not here to arrest you. 
 What do you want, then? 
 There are other people like you. I'm helping them. 
 Others? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you helping them for? 
 My wife is one of them. 
 Your wife? 
 Yes. 
 Ah. 
 My nearest and dearest are long gone. 
 Well, listen, mate, it's not safe for you to be out here alone. 
 We've got a doctor. We'd like to get you checked out, if that's OK. 
 Beau squealed on me, didn't he? 
 He could go to juvenile prison. 
 He'll survive. 
 He's a kid. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Come on, let's... 
 Don't touch it! 
 What's in that? 
 My f*cking scruples. 
 Let's go. 
 Paddy, this is Dr McKellar. 
 God save us. A woman? 
 Yes, and she'll need to examine you. 
 I'd like to check your vitals, run some tests, same as the others. 
 Why? 
 Because you've been dead for 100 years. 
 Well, madam, you're more than welcome to check my vitals, but I wonder, do you have a toolhouse? 
 Round the back. 
 Much obliged. 
 I need to speak to Kirstie. 
 Good morning. 
 Who are you? 
 Patrick Michael Fitzgerald. 
 The mayor? 
 Correct. 
 And you must be the resurrected wife. 
 It's Kate. 
 Well, now, Kate, aren't we the lucky ones? 
 Are we? 
 We are if we play our cards right. 
 Your husband, now, he's the lucky one. 
 I wish I could dig up my wife. 
 James : Your full name is Kirsten Margaret Darrow. 
 Yeah, I remember that. 
 OK. 
 And the police file confirms that, yes, you were murdered. 
 I knew that too. 
 Alright, what I'm about to tell you is a bit tougher. 
 You were killed by your boyfriend. 
 Kev. 
 Yes, Kevin James Brunner. 
 (Laughs mirthlessly) 
 Why would he do that? 
 Well, the police file says that there was an altercation that led to a dispute, and it mentions jealousy as a possible motive. 
 Did he admit to it? 
 No, he didn't, but apparently there was clear and overwhelming physical evidence. 
 Where is he now? 
 He went to jail for 18 years and he was released in 2006. 
 I wanna see that, please. 
 No, Kirstie, these are crime scene photos. You don't wanna see them. 
 It's my file. 
 It's my body. I wanna see it. 
 Are you OK? 
 I wanna see the b*st*rd and I wanna look him in the face. 
 You can't leave town. 
 Well, then, you arrest him and you make him face me! 
 Kirstie, I understand how you feel, but he did his time already and in the eyes of the law he has paid his dues. 
 You said you'd help me. 
 I said I'd do what I could, and I will. 
 
 
 
 You can turn left to the hospital in Shepparton. You can take me there. 
 Let's get the others first. 
 No. 
 If there's a chance of bringing Anna back, we have to go now. 
 They'll subject you to all sorts of tests and procedures. 
 Well, then, we need to get started as soon as possible. 
 You saw my Leon. He doesn't have much time. 
 What about your friends, hmm? They deserve help too. 
 Let James help them. 
 Just... just call James. 
 Why aren't you calling him? 
 I wanna talk to James. 
 I'm trying to help. 
 No, you're not! 
 No, you're just the same as the doctor. 
 You want to keep this to yourself, don't you? 
 Take me to Elishia's. 
 (Whimpers) 
 (Screams) 
 I'm heading out to Rochester. 
 Finding John and Maria needs to be the priority. 
 Go find them. I'm not stopping you. 
 And what if that policeman finds them? 
 Well, I'll call him, but listen -- 
 Kirstie's ex is my first proper lead, OK? 
 I've gotta follow it up. He might know something. 
 Know what? 
 Alexandro died before I could speak to him, Maria's husband's non compos. 
 This is the first person apart from me who's got a real connection to these people! 
 I have to go again. I promised Kirstie. 
 OK, then. 
 And then I... I will talk to Sarah. 
 You can't avoid this forever. 
 I said I'd deal with it and I will. 
 Anna : You can stop here. 
 Vic : Why here? 
 (Gasps) 
 This is where she died. 
 My beautiful little girl. 
 We both did. 
 So, this isn't the way to the doctor's? 
 You're playing a very silly game, Maria. 
 They've been kind to me, James and Kate. 
 All of them. 
 I'm asking you one last time. 
 Take me to the doctor's. 
 Leon must have planted this. 
 (Sobs) 
 After everything... to remember us. 
 You know, he gave me roses the first time we went dancing. 
 He was so handsome. 
 (Paper crinkles) 
 Kevin Brunner? 
 Yeah? 
 Thought I might have a little chat, if you don't mind. 
 Where were you last Wednesday night? 
 Er, Wednesday I did a job in Epsom, cleaned up a bloke's yard. 
 OK, and you can prove that, that you were in Epsom? 
 What's this about? 
 Answer the question. 
 Listen, I've been keeping my nose... 
 Answer the question. 
 I got paperwork in the car. I'll show you. 
 I got an invoice. 
 It's got job description, it's got hours I worked. 
 Here! 
 This is the guy. That's his number. 
 Call him up, he'll tell you. 
 Then tell me this when was the last time you were in Yoorana? 
 Ah. So, this is about Kirstie Darrow. 
 Do you keep in contact with anyone there? 
 No. Not anymore. 
 Do you know where she's buried? 
 Yeah, course I do. 
 Oh, so, you've visited the grave, have you? 
 No, I have not, and I don't intend to either! 
 Do you ever wish you could see her again, Kirstie? 
 None of your f*cking business! 
 That is my f*cking business! 
 Are you gonna arrest me?... Nah? 
 Piss off! 
 (Mimics gun firing) 
 Been looking for you. 
 This paddock's full of rabbits. 
 Vermin ruining the land. 
 I'm sorry about last night. 
 No need to be. 
 I just found out how I died. 
 It was pretty f*cking awful too. 
 You wanna help me? 
 With what? 
 Settling a score. 
 Arggh! 
 (Phone number dial whirrs) 
 (Ringing tone) 
 Kevin, on phone : Hello? 
 Kevin? 
 Who's this? 
 Someone you thought you'd never see again. 
 What? 
 Do you remember my voice, Kev? 
 Hey... who is this? 
 That copper put you up to this? 
 I've got a message for you. 
 Would you like to hear it? 
 What is it? 
 Wouldn't you like to see me, hear it from my lips? 
 Where? 
 You know where. 
 The soft spot. 
 Um... by the lake? 
 Ten o'clock tonight. 
 Come alone. 
 You won't get a second chance. 
 He sounded scared. 
 Good. 
 What are you doing? 
 Trying to get this old bike to work. 
 Used to have one just like it. 
 Won't work. It's dead. 
 We'll see. 
 There's something I wanna do. 
 I didn't do it when I moved here, and then I got too sick. 
 You can't leave Yoorana. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Not gonna do anything stupid, are you? 
 Oh, would you back off?! 
 What do you want from us? 
 (Children shout and laugh) 
 Hi. Sorry. 
 Sarah : Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Elishia : There's the heart. 
 (Heartbeat thuds) 
 Beating strong. 
 Perfectly healthy baby. 
 I take it you still don't want to know the s*x? 
 No, no, we wanted it to be a surprise. 
 I'd like to know. 
 Really? 
 You were so sure you wanted to wait. 
 Yeah, I changed my mind. 
 OK. Yeah, OK, that's fine by me. 
 Well, it's a girl. 
 A girl! Oh! 
 I think we're all done here. 
 Thank you. Thanks, Elishia. 
 There you go. 
 Oh! Thanks. 
 You OK? 
 Thank you. 
 I just spoke to Kevin Brunner, Kirstie's killer. 
 He doesn't know anything. 
 I don't care about that. Where's John and where's Maria? 
 I don't know, and Vic's not answering any of his phone calls. 
 Something's wrong. 
 How's Kirstie? 
 What about Kate? 
 She's fine. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Dr McKellar. 
 Yes. OK. 
 OK, you got everything? 
 I'll be there. 
 Let me drop you home. 
 What were you thinking? 
 I don't remember anything. 
 Don't even know who I am. 
 That's not a good enough reason. 
 There's nothing for me here. 
 Come on. 
 No, I'm not going back to the others. 
 We're not going back. 
 Got something I wanna show you. 
 You were buried outside the cemetery, which means you were either a suicide or a murderer. 
 I looked up some records and found these. That's you. 
 There were a bunch of runaway convicts in the 1830s. 
 Three of them went bush, lived for a while as bushrangers. 
 They were caught, flogged, and hanged. 
 They buried them in Yoorana. 
 What did they do? 
 Robbed and killed a coachload of people. 
 So, I am a murderer. 
 You would have been treated brutally. 
 Are you trying to justify it? 
 You're angry because your memories aren't coming back, so start afresh, make up your own story. 
 Decide what kind of a person you want to be. 
 Are you OK? 
 Is there something you want to talk about? 
 Is there something wrong with the baby? 
 Because I saw you and Dr McKellar talking... 
 No, no, there's nothing wrong with the baby. 
 I promise you everything's fine with the baby! 
 Then what is it? 
 It's about Kate. 
 I know that this is hard. 
 But we're about to have a baby together. 
 We're about to have a little girl. 
 And this is the first night that we've had together, just the two of us, in ages. 
 There's gonna be three of us soon. 
 So, let's just go inside and relax, and eat some dinner and go to bed. 
 We can talk in the morning. 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 Kirstie : Kevin? 
 Who is that? 
 Kirstie. 
 Come back, Kevin. 
 This can't be real. 
 Are you a ghost? 
 Got a question for you. Why'd you kill me? 
 What did I do to you? 
 Nothing! 
 You strangled me. 
 No! No. 
 You drowned me... in the lake. 
 No, no, no! No, I didn't, .. but you must know that. 
 I don't know anything. 
 God... It is you. 
 Oh! 
 Are you alright? 
 (Gasps) 
 It wasn't Kev. He didn't do it! 
 I have to go after him! 
 I don't think we should do this. 
 We have to. 
 What's... what's going on? 
 Just then you said you didn't kill me, and I... I didn't remember, but now I do. 
 OK. 
 So, on that night I went down to the lake 'cause we had a fight? 
 f*ck, Kirstie, I'm so sorry that I didn't follow you. 
 It's not your fault. 
 'Cause I stormed off. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 None of that matters anymore. 
 Yeah, it does. 
 'Cause you're innocent. 
 No-one thought so. 
 Cops, judge, your family. 
 Even my own... f*cking parents. 
 After a few years, I started to believe it myself. 
 You're a good man, Kevin. 
 But I spent half my life in jail, Kirse. 
 So, whatever was good in me, it's been beaten out. 
 It never should have happened. 
 No, but it did. 
 And now it's too late. 
 What about my real murderer? 
 They just get away with it? That's not very right... 
 That's... that's the world now. 
 Yeah? 
 You just died too young to learn that. 
 There is no justice. 
 Nothing is fair. 
 You just live your life, you just keep your head down. 
 Yeah, you don't look people in the eyes. 
 You don't talk to people, because they'll f*cking spit in your face. 
 I could tell 'em all that you're innocent. 
 Yeah(!) 
 Then they'd believe you. 
 Yeah, you do that, Kirstie. That's a great idea(!) 
 And maybe I can be 21 again, hmm? 
 Maybe I could have my life back. 
 Maybe we could get married. 
 (Sobs) Maybe we could have those kids! 
 And everything would be alright. 
 No, I can't... I can't do this. 
 Kev! Please, just don't cry. 
 (Sobs) Please, just... 
 (Cries) 
 Goodbye, sweetheart! 
 Kev... (Sobs) 
 Kev... Kev! (Sobs) 
 (Crickets chirp) 
 Still no word on Maria. 
 Where do you think she is? 
 I don't know. 
 It was never gonna work, trying to keep you all here, I just... I just didn't know what else to do. 
 I've probably made it worse. 
 (Car approaches) 
 (Car door slams) 
 Hope you haven't been waiting too long. 
 Yeah, that's one of ours. Bit old, though. 
 (Keyboard clicks) 
 Ah! Mrs Wright. She died about five years ago. 
 Husband pulled up stumps after that. 
 Hmm. So, the place is abandoned? 
 Do you have an address? 
 Yes, I can give you directions. 
 Er, I'm, er... I'm sorry, I, er... I left you in the lurch. 
 Cops are after you. I dobbed on you. 
 The least I deserve. 
 Woman : Who that there, Mum? 
 Don't know. 
 His name's Paddy. 
 Patrick Michael Fitzgerald, ma'am. An honour to meet you. 
 Excuse me, what do you want? 
 Well, I... I'll show you this. 
 Is that what you got from the house? Some old dress? 
 No, it's not some old dress, Beau. 
 It's... 
 It's... the dress that I gave to the love of my life, Kalinda. 
 Yeah. 
 Kath, look at this. 
 That's your grandmother's, isn't it? 
 That's... that's Kalinda. 
 That's my Kalinda. 
 Your grandmother? 
 (Speaks Indigenous language) 
 OK, what's going on? 
 (Speaks Indigenous language) 
 Mum, what is he saying? 
 He said he is our father. 
 He said Kalinda was his wife. 
 (Motor starts) 
 (Dog barks) 
 Hello, darling! 
 She's back! 
 Hello? 
 Hello, Sarah. 
 We never forgot you for a minute, Kate, but we have found something and it's real. 
 I'm named after Charlie. 
 Man : The Anzac legend? 
 Do you know much about him? 
 I know pretty much all there is to know. 
 You lot, you're the fruit of my loins. You're Fitzgeralds! 
 I can understand that it's possible to love us both, but I'm back now. 
 I know. 
 I have reason to believe you're harbouring people. 
 You know exactly what I'm talking about! 
 It's funny, you coming here, searching for Charlie. 
 Is it? 
 Can I show you something? 
 Is somebody there with you now? 
 Yes. 
 Something's wrong. 
 I have to up go. 
 He's coming. 
 Patrick Fitzgerald? 
 Run! Run, run, run, run, run! 
 (Gunshot)
