 Help me. 
 (Distant barking) 
 Thanks for coming, James. Couldn't bring myself to do it. 
 He just went crazy. 
 It's no worries, Jules. 
 Killed a couple of my sheep. 
 Yeah. He'll be alright.

 Man, on radio : Hey, mate, you still at Lindsey's? 
 Yep. 
 Hey, listen, when you're done there, can you pop over to the cemetery? 
 We had a call about some disturbance there. 
 Cemetery? 
 Yeah, look, it's probably a prank and I'd do it myself, but I've got a guest in the presidential suite. 
 Yeah, righto, Chris. 
 Alright, mate. 
 (Growling) 
 (Sighs deeply) Rocky. 
 You're born, then you nibble on a leg of lamb and then you die. 
 And they chuck you in a hole in the ground and the worms eat you. 
 (Growling continues) 
 It's f*cked, basically. 
 (Barking) 
 But, mate... you were loved.

 You OK? 
 Alright. Here you go. 
 Keep the pressure on. 
 (Breathes rapidly) 
 What's going on? Where are your clothes? 
 My leg... 
 Yeah, how did you do that? 
 (Whimpers) 
 Emergency services, this is Sergeant James Hayes. 
 I'm gonna need an ambulance at the Yoorana Cemetery. 
 I have an injured woman here. 
 Man, on radio : Copy that. 
 Hey. My name's James. What's your name? 
 How'd you wind up here? 
 (Distant gasp) 
 (Whimpers) 
 (Man mumbles indistinctly) 
 (Breathes heavily) You talk to me? 
 It's the police. 
 Can you come towards the light, please? 
 You alright there, mate? 
 (Man coughs) 
 Yoorana 3-0-2, requesting assistance. 
 I'm gonna need backup from Echuca. 
 I've got a bunch of naked people down at the cemetery. 
 Man, on radio : Roger. 
 James. 
 Elishia, where's the ambo? 
 On a call-out. What's happened? 
 I've no idea but there's more than one of them. 
 How many? 
 Um, I don't know. Can you take a look at her leg? 
 Hello. I'm Dr Elishia McKellar. What's your name? 
 OK, this wound's gonna need to be cleaned and stitched. 
 Can you get her to Shepparton Hospital? 
 I could take her to the surgery. 
 OK. 
 Hey. Can you come here, please? 
 I'll get you a blanket. 
 Here, cover yourself up. 
 What's going on, mate? 
 How many of you are here? 
 Where am I? 
 You're in a graveyard. 
 Where do you think you are? 
 Help me, please. 
 It's OK, it's the police. 
 It's alright. Here, here, here. You're alright, you're alright. 
 Could be drugs? 
 I can do a blood test. 
 Can we take them all to the surgery? 
 Yeah. 
 (Twigs snap) 
 Hey, James. 
 Yeah? 
 There's another one in the bushes. 
 OK, listen, you take the injured one, I'll round the rest up. 
 Make your way towards me, please. 
 (Speaks in foreign language) 
 It's OK, mate. I'm a police officer. Come this way. 
 Can you walk on it? 
 (Whimpers) 
 OK. 
 Careful. Careful. 
 Here. 
 Come on. 
 It's alright. It's alright. Yep. 
 Good. 
 Hello. Are you injured? 
 No. 
 Here. 
 It's alright. It's alright. It's alright, I'm a doctor. 
 Thank you. 
 Hop in the car. 
 (Engine starts) 
 (Reversing alarm beeps) 
 Where am I? 
 Yoorana. 
 If you can just get cleaned up in here... 
 (Water runs) 
 James : Just up to the end, yeah. 
 All done. Can you tell me what happened to you? 
 No. 
 Who are the others with you? 
 (Electrical crackling) 
 Do you know you're in Yoorana? 
 Yeah, 'course. 
 Doesn't look like anyone else is injured, but you'll need to check that. 
 I'm gonna get the men cleaned up. 
 I found another one. 
 So there's five? 
 How is she, is she alright? 
 Yep. 
 Wound's cleaned and dressed. 
 OK. 
 Do you have anything better than blankets here? 
 Uh, upstairs, hall cupboard. 
 Here you go, fellas, I've got something for you to put on. 
 Um... here you go, you can put this on. 
 That should fit, here you go. 
 So, what happened, mate? Was it some kind of dare or...? 
 Was it some kind of satanic ritual? 
 Or were you just on the piss? 
 Hm? 
 Elishia : Do you know your name? 
 My name? 
 What about you? 
 It's Kate. My name's Kate. 
 Do you know where you live? 
 A farm. 
 A farm, alright. 
 Do you have an address for the farm? 
 Hey, where are you going? Stay with me. 
 Oi, it's alright, back here. 
 Could you come back here, please? Hey! 
 It's alright. It's alright, just come... 
 Could you come back here, please? Hey! 
 Hey, where are you going? 
 (Sirens blare, dogs barks) 
 Man : Hey, stop running! 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 Mio dio! (Breathes heavily) 
 (Speaks Italian).. Yoorana. 
 Yoorana? Yes, yes, this is Yoorana. 
 That's right. 
 Carlo... (Speaks in Italian) 
 .. Yoorana? 
 Carlo? You're Carlo? 
 (Ding!) 
 (Dinging) 
 Please don't do that, Kate. 
 I know this place. 
 What, the surgery? 
 Yeah. 
 That's good. 
 Were you a patient here? 
 I'm sure I am. 
 Do you remember Dr Kelly? He was here before me. 
 Yeah, I remember Dr Kelly. 
 So I should be able to look you up on the database. 
 What's your last name? 
 It's OK, Carlo. Let's get back inside and get the doctor to check you out. 
 It's alright. 
 Why do I know you? 
 What...? 
 Elishia : You know her? 
 What are you doing? 
 What's going on? 
 James? 
 Who are you? 
 Kate. 
 I don't understand, what is it? 
 It can't be Kate. 
 I'm Kate Willis. 
 No... No, no, no. No. 
 Elishia : Why not? 
 Because Kate's dead. 
 OK, I've just taken this woman's blood pressure and she's not dead. 
 See this? This is Kate. 
 Well, she... she looks like her. 
 Kate died two years ago. 
 Let me see. 
 You took this. 
 Kate : Coffee stain. 
 What? 
 My birthmark. 
 I told you... 
 That's what you called it. 
 We're... we're married. 
 James... 
 James. 
 James, what... what's happened? 
 (Sobbing) No... 
 (Mutters breathlessly) 
 (Mutters) 
 (Spits) 
 Aargh! Gotcha! What do you want? 
 Nothing. 
 What's that? 
 My phone. I... I was filming you. 
 You what? 
 I saw you coming out of the ground! 
 What are you talkin' about? 
 You're talkin' shite. 
 No, I saw you. There were a bunch of you. 
 Coming out of f*cking coffins! 
 Coffins? 
 What?! 
 Oh, that's it. 
 It's a dream. 
 Very, very strange dream. 
 You alright, mate? 
 Hm? Of course I'm bloody alright. 
 Do you know where you are? 
 'Course I know where I am! I'm... I'm... I'm... 
 Yoorana. 
 Arse end of the arse end of the world. 
 Hang on there, boyo. 
 The Royal. 
 The Royal? 
 Do you know where it is? 
 Yeah, it's around the corner. 
 Lead on. 
 No, I've got to get home. 
 Ah, there, come on, there's a good lad. 
 What do you want? 
 I want a f*cking drink. 
 What do you think I want? 
 The MCCD says 13 October 2013, St Patrick's Hospice. 
 Why are you saying that? 
 It's all here on file, the illness and the death certificate. 
 I don't care what the file says. 
 I was there. 
 But I'm here. 
 (Sighs) Then you're not her. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Come with me. 
 Where? 
 I want to show you something. 
 What about the others? 
 I don't know. 
 Take their pulse. 
 Where are you taking me? 
 sh1t. 
 (Squealing and coughing) 
 (Inhales deeply) 
 (Coughing) 
 Oh... (Speaks indistinctly) 
 Kate. 
 (Sobbing) No, no, no, no, no. 
 Kate, no, don't. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Man : Hello! 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Is that you, James? 
 Hey! 
 Yep, hey! 
 I was on my way back to Echuca, I got your call. How are ya? 
 What's going on, mate? 
 Hey. 
 I called the station, but Chris said you hadn't come in. 
 So I... just did a quick run-around looking for you. 
 How are you? 
 Good. Good to see you. 
 What, someone just done that? 
 Hmm. 
 What, are they still here? 
 Nah. No, they've gone. 
 Who was it, where'd they go? 
 It's just local kids. I can handle that. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, it's fine. 
 I've gotta go. 
 Sure. 
 Pressure's 120 over 80. 
 That's good. 
 Good. 
 (Mobile rings) 
 Hello. 
 James, on phone : Is Kate there? 
 No. She ran off when we were at the cemetery. 
 Her grave was empty. There are a whole bunch of empty graves. 
 What are you trying to tell me, James, they're all dead? 
 OK, listen, just sit tight 'til I get back there, OK? 
 Keep them calm, don't tell them anything. Call me if Kate shows up. 
 sh1t. 
 Anna. 
 Is that your name? 
 Yes. 
 That's my name, Anna. 
 Well, that's good. Do you remember anything, Anna? 
 (Whispers) 'Hail... hail, Mary. 
 Blessed art thou amongst women. 
 Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us, sinners, now and at the hour of our death.' 
 Oh, yeah... there she is. 
 The Royal, huh? 
 Hasn't changed a bit. 
 Can't get in, though. 
 Well, of course you can't, if you're a native. 
 What? No, you f*cking racist. It's because it's closed. 
 What? Hang on, wait. Hang on. 
 You have to help me. 
 Why should I? 
 Because you're... 
 You wouldn't leave a man stranded now, would you, boyo? 
 The name's Beau. 
 Come on then, Beau. 
 Come on, you b*st*rd. Let us in. 
 (Mumbles indistinctly) 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Come on, you... 
 This is as far as it goes. 
 Look at that, huh? 
 You should get in there, no bother. 
 Look at you, you're all prick and ribs. 
 In you get. 
 That's 'break and enter'. 
 The only crime is getting caught. 
 Good lad. Go on. 
 
 
 
 (Laundry machine hums) 
 What kept you? 
 Chris : Are you sure? 
 It was interfered with. Dirt everywhere. 
 Kate's buried in that cemetery. 
 Said it was local hoons. 
 Really? Who? 
 Didn't say. 
 Maybe I should give him another try. 
 Thanks for this. 
 (Mobile buzzes) 
 Hi. 
 I'm sorry I ran. 
 It's OK. 
 I shouldn't have taken you there. 
 We used to come here, didn't we? 
 Yeah. 
 I remember. 
 I remember being sick... as well. 
 I'm so scared. 
 I just... couldn't keep going with the chemo. 
 I f*cked up. 
 I should've kept fighting. 
 You did. 
 I couldn't do anything. 
 You were so good to me, James. 
 (Sighs) 
 We should get you back to the surgery. 
 Let's just stay here for a while. 
 (Sighs) 
 What did you call this? 
 The giant kaleidoscope. 
 Why am I here? 
 Why am I back? 
 I don't know. 
 But I'm gonna take care of you. 
 No matter what. 
 (Soft jangly music) 
 Lord God above. 
 (Whispering) Wake up, wake up. 
 What? 
 (Jangly poker machine music) 
 Wake up, Paddy. Wake up. 
 What is all this? Shite! 
 Huh? I mean, what is...? What have they don't to the place, huh? 
 Why can't I wake up?! 
 You want beer? 
 (Sighs) I most certainly do. 
 (Gulps) 
 Aahhh! 
 You're not havin' one, yourself? 
 I'm only 16. 
 So? 
 Aaah! 
 Maybe you were in a coma. 
 What? 
 Then they buried you. 
 Then you woke up. 
 No. No, Beau, that's not it. 
 What happened then? 
 I must be plastered. I must had an awful skinful. 
 Maybe I had a go on the magic pipe. 
 What?... (Stammers) T-T-Then why are you covered in dirt? 
 It's my knife. 
 Really? 
 On my mother's grave. 
 This is no dream. 
 I told you. 
 This is a bloody nightmare. 
 Thanks. It's good tucker. 
 I'm f*cking starving. 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 Alexandro's going to die. 
 What? 
 That's what he said. 
 I can understand him. He said, 'Alexandro's going to die.' 
 Who is Alexandro? Who is he? 
 (Clattering) 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 Assassinio. 
 Elishia, can I see you for a minute, please? 
 I've done all the basic medical checks. 
 For anything more, an MRI, you have to take her to the hospital. 
 Let's go. 
 No. We have to. 
 I'm not spending what time I have left getting tests done in a hospital. 
 Don't say that. Who knows how long this will last? 
 We don't know why you're back. 
 You think Shepparton Hospital's gonna tell you? 
 Medical staff will have to hand her on to an army of researchers and doctors who will demand an explanation. 
 That's... not an option. 
 So what, we just hide you? 
 There is the Lazarus Syndrome -- spontaneous return of circulation after failed attempts at resuscitation. 
 Coming back to life. 
 Those cases are usually 20 minutes, 45 minutes, an hour at the most. 
 What about the others? What have they remembered? 
 Not much, first names. 
 OK, I need to know your names. Do you know your name? 
 Charlie. 
 What's your full name? 
 I can't remember. 
 Do you know your name? 
 Date of birth. Do you know where you were born? 
 Bloody Yoorana, alright. Why's it your business? 
 Do you know your name? 
 It's Anna. 
 Anna. OK, Anna. Do you know when you were born? 
 2 March 1931. 
 When did you die? 
 Die? 
 Where's the other one who was with you? Where's Carlo? 
 (Door opens and closes) 
 (Clattering) 
 Hey. 
 Hey, what do you think you're doing? 
 What do you think you're doing, mate? 
 Polizia? 
 Uh-huh, that's right. 
 You've been mucking around in the cemetery tonight, have you, my friend? 
 Cimitero? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Si. Si. 
 Alright. 
 Why don't you come for a little ride with me? Come on. 
 Come on. 
 James, it's Vic. Give me a call. 
 (Music plays softly) 
 Coinage in the bag. 
 What? 
 Money. Or the Abo gets his throat slit. 
 Let go of me. 
 Come on! Move it, you gobshite. 
 Some of your finest tobacco too while you're at it. 
 Come on! 
 Good work. Very handy. 
 Don't call me 'Abo'. 
 Bollocks. 
 Yeah, yeah. (Pants) Come on. 
 That's... wai... that's you! 
 What? 
 That's you. 
 (Reads) 'Patrick Fitzgerald. Born Dun Longa-hair.' 
 Dun Laoghaire. 
 'Born Dun Laoghaire, Ireland, 1812. 
 Died Yoorana, Victoria, 1864'? 
 Died? 
 That's 150 years ago. 
 I died? 
 (Reads) 'First mayor of Yoorana.' 
 Mayor. 
 I can't... 
 (Car approaches) 
 Let's go, let's go. 
 Come on, got to go. 
 Hey, yeah, that's me! 
 I'm the f*ckin' mayor! 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 No, you lost me. 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 None capisco, mate. 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 (Echoing thuds) 
 (Shouts in Italian) 
 (Shouts) 
 (Pants and speaks softly in Italian) 
 Alexandro? Alexandro? 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 (Shouts in Italian) 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 Vic. 
 Think I found one of your cemetery vandals. 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 It's Carlo. It's OK. 
 What, you know him? 
 Where'd you find him? 
 Picked him up trying to break into the Noregard site. 
 Dirt under his nails. Said he'd been in the cemetery. 
 No, no, that was a couple of local kids. 
 It's a hell of a lot of damage for just a couple of kids. 
 Where's Chris? 
 Uh, bloke sobered up, so he took him home. 
 OK, um, thanks for covering for us. I'll take it from here. 
 Um, so those kids, are you gonna press charges? 
 No. No, they're just schoolies. I'll talk to the parents. 
 And, um... So you don't think this guy had anything to do with it? 
 Nah. 
 But he was trespassing. 
 Are you gonna write it up? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 'Course I will. You don't have to tell me how to do my job, Vic. 
 Hey, I wouldn't presume. (Chuckles) 
 I'm just here if you need me. 
 I'm fine. 
 Alright, if you think you're OK. 
 I am. 
 And thanks for your help. 
 OK. Well, I'll see you later then. 
 OK. 
 Thanks, Vic. 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 OK, Carlo, you're coming with me. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 He said, 'We came here from Sicily to work and then the war began.' 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 'I'm a prisoner at a camp in Yoorana.' 
 What camp? 
 There was a camp here. 
 During the war, they locked up the Italians. 
 Really? 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 'My brother, Alexandro Nico, is desperate. He slit his wrists.' 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 (Responds in Italian) 
 What... what happened to him? Did he say 'Alexandro Nico'? 
 Si. Si, e mio fratello, Alexandro Nico. 
 I have a patient named Alexandro Nico. 
 Lives just out of town, but he's in his 90s. 
 Do you have an address? 
 Down Mill Hill Road. 
 But you can't go there now... 
 Let's go and see your brother. 
 See Alexandro. 
 Alexandro, si. 
 Yes, great. 
 Do you want me to come with you? 
 No, can you stay here? Don't let anybody see them. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 Listen. If Alexandro knows this guy, if he confirms that this is his brother... 
 What does it prove? 
 That we're back from the dead. 
 Pardon? 
 Bullshit. 
 This is a miracle. 
 OK, come on. 
 (Crickets chirp) 
 You know there's still a bunch of Fitzgeralds in town? 
 Pleased to hear it. 
 They're filthy rich too. 
 Are they now? 
 Help yourself there. That's half yours. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. You're my china. 
 Do you remember being dead? 
 No. 
 Nor how my life ended so soon. 
 But you didn't die that young. 
 Didn't I? 
 Then why am I back? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know what I know. 
 Redress and restitution, Beau. 
 Redress and restitution. 
 (Distant thunder rumbles) 
 (Speaks in Italian) 
 sh1t, your eye's bleeding. 
 (Retches) 
 Carlo, wait. 
 (Wheezes) 
 Carlo? 
 Carlo, wait. Wait. 
 (Coughs) 
 Hey! 
 Hey, stop. 
 (Gun cocks) 
 (Dogs bark) 
 Alexandro. 
 (Screams) 
 (Car door closes, engine starts) 
 (Phone rings) 
 Come on, pick up. 
 Pick up, pick up, pick up. Pick up the phone! 
 Kate? Kate! 
 Are you alright? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Where's Carlo? 
 Elishia : You OK? 
 (Sighs) 
 I have to talk to you. 
 Here. 
 Blood came out of his eyes, he got out of the car, and he... 
 He... he... he decomposed in front of me. 
 Into this. 
 How can that happen? 
 I don't... I don't understand it. 
 Is this gonna happen to Kate? 
 Well, it hasn't happened yet. 
 What are you saying, it's a matter of time? 
 I'm telling you I don't know. 
 You're a doctor, so what do you suggest? 
 C-can I have a look at it? 
 Don't tell Kate about this, don't tell the others about this. 
 Are you asking me to lie? 
 I'm asking you to keep this between us, for now. 
 Well, for now. 
 (Magpies call) 
 (Insects buzz) 
 Did you do it here? 
 Yeah. 
 At the church. 
 Did you speak? 
 I tried to. 
 I read from that book you wanted me to read from. 
 The Bridge Of San Luis Rey. 
 I couldn't do it. (Sighs deeply) 
 Did you have a wake? 
 At the house. I was a basket case. Everybody helped. 
 Sarah did a lot. 
 Oh, beautiful Sarah. 
 I want to sleep in my own bed. 
 I think you should stay here, with the doctor. 
 For now. 
 (Chuckling) 
 Woman : Well, someone's woken up. 
 'Morning. 
 Good morning. Are you OK? 
 You shouldn't have spoken to your mother like that. 
 She's doing the best she can. 
 Yeah. Uh, I got these. For Kylie. 
 Thanks. 
 Mwah. See you later, Mum. 
 (Groaning) 
 Why have you got that face on? 
 Do I have a face on? 
 Serious face on. 
 He ran in here when they came in for training. 
 So he's still in there? 
 It's alright, I don't want to hurt you. 
 (Groans) 
 I made a fortune, bloody fortune. 
 Time has come now for me to go, get it back. 
 Dr McKellar. 
 Sergeant Eastley came by this morning asking questions. 
 Oh, this is my house. 
 Where are you going? 
 Anywhere but here. 
 She's bleeding. 
 So are you. 
 This is too important to be left to the police. 
 This more important to me than anyone. 
 They're my patients and I have a duty to protect them. 
 Elishia!
