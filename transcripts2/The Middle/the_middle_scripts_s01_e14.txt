 (crows caw) 
 Hey! Wait! Somebody! 
 Frankie : yep, that's me, Trapped in an office supply store at 4:00 in the morning. 
 How'd I end up here? 
 Well, how does anyone end up where they don't want to be? 
 Either drugs or kids. How do I look? I can take it. I need some constructive criticism. Tryouts are Thursday. You know what would really impress the judges? If you lit the ends on fire, like they do in hawaii. This is a serious sport, axl. They don't just let anyone wear the white patent leather boots. (crash) Oh, man. That would have been so much cooler on fire. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought you were babysitting For the craigs Thursday night. I'm gonna have to cancel. Are you sure that's a good idea, honey? I-I'm just saying, We don't know what's gonna happen with majorettes, But if you go to babysitting, At least you know you'll have $6. Mom, with the swine flu outbreak, I have a real shot this year. A lot of good people are down. Frankie : brick? Uh, oh, that's right. It's hat day next week. Good job staying ahead of schedule. That's definitely a crazy hat. It's hat day next week? Oh, no. I need a hat. Uh, brick? This isn't for hat day. That would be embarrassing. I just want people to pay attention to me at breakfast. Yesterday none of you said a single word to me. Axl, you're coming straight home after school To work on your aztec report, right? (mouth full) god, chill. I'm on it. Oh, are you? "12 to 15 pages double-spaced, "no fewer than six color charts or graphs Bound in an oxford ready-clip, clear-front report cover." Listen, mr. Gottlieb is tough. He's not gonna pass you just so you can play basketball. Yeah, I know. Parents really need to talk to him. He's got no school spirit. Axl, this is 40% of your grade. You do get that's almost half, right? The paper's not even due for, like, a week. God, you treat me like a little kid. I'm practically an adult. In what way? You don't make your own food, you don't buy your own clothes, You don't even remember to flush the toilet unless I remind you. I'm almost old enoh to go to war. Not if we want to win, you're not. Dad, how do you live with her? I live with her by doing what she says. You will do the same. Oh! You are so annoying. You live to make me miserable. (exhales) Maybe we should call that one a write-off And just work on the others. So guess what? Hmm? Charlotte and I are having our 3-week anniversary. Oh! Really? Yeah. Wanna see a picture of her? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So are you two getting serious? Well, if by "serious" you mean madly in love, I'd have to say,uilty! Yay! Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, here's another one. Uh, I can't show you that one. It's private. Okay. Oh, here's a good one. I'll forward it to your phone. Oh, no, my phone costs, like, a dollar. It doesn't do any of that stuff. Oh, sure it does. (cell phone alert chimes) see? Oh, my god. I had no idea. Oh, you sent me the wrong one. Oh! Yeah. Okay. And it takes pictures. Smile. (camera phone shutter clicks) And movies. No way. Yeah, you can make your own movies. You can put faces on thimbles and act our your entire prom, The way it should have gone. It's very cathartic... I hear. (click) Axl... Why is your textbook in the exact same position It was in this morning? It hasn't moved. Honk. There. It's moved. Happy? Hey, you watch your tone, mister. What tone? You're always imagining this tone. Ugh! God, why do you have to ride me all the time? And then I got an idea, A brilliant, glorious idea-- I would film my kids and show them what they sounded like. ...Until you achieve total mind control? Honey, can you please not twirl in the house? Well, where am I supposed to do it? It's too cold outside, and my fingers freeze up, And if I can't practice, then I won't make the team,  And it will be all your fault! Brick, your dad's going to the mall. You want to go with him to look for a hat? Brick? Any response would be nice. And once I started, I couldn't stop. This thing was power. Axl : god, I hear you! (imitates frankie) "do your paper. Have you done your paper?" Sue : I will! I did! Brick : I am! Ugh! Oh! Ugh! After several days of collecting evidence... Okay. It was showtime. I wasn't just doing this for myself. I was doing it for moms through the ages who'd had enough. (door closes) Hey, honey. Hey, mike. Oh, hey, bob. Bob was just helping me set up That thing I told you about that I want to show the kids. Oh. How long is that gonna take? I had long ago accepted that mike and bob Weren't gonna ever be friends. It's not that mike didn't like bob, it's just... Yeah, he just didn't like him. So, michael michael bo-bikel. (chuckles) How goeth the job search? (grunts) A little slow. That's why I like to come home and relax. Hey, I'm an idiot. Why didn't I think of this? The guy riding shotgun on my night shift,. Delivering little betty snack cakes, just quit. If you're interested, I can put your name in. It's uh, union pay, easy gig. I don't know, bob. I don't want to put you out. Union pay. Easy gig. Mike. Sounds great. Riding with you, huh? Yeah. Kids, can you come in here? Come on, everybody. Come on in. S-sit down. Everybody, sit down. Okay, we are gonna watch some educational television. Now there's been some bad behavior going on, And I think it's about time I brought it to your attention. And I must warn you, what you are about to see is not pretty. Seriously, when did u hatch this plan to ruin my life? Hey, you recorded me? ...Is to make me some sort of mindless zombie here. Frankie : yeah. Yeah, o-obviously I-I don't have To destroy your life, axl, 'cause you're doing a pretty damn good job of it yourself. Ugh! Sue : mom? Hey, time is passing, axl! Okay. Wait. Hold on. That's the wrong spot. Frankie : I went to school! I did my homework! Why do I have to do your homework?! (beep, video fast-forwards) Okay, there we go. ...I won't make it, and it will be all your fault! Not so pretty, sue, is it? My fault? Why is everything my fault, huh?! I suppose it'll be my fault, too, if you forget to call Mrs. Craig and tell her you can't sit on Thursday. Am I talking for my own health here?! (beep) Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's wrong. (video fast-forwards) I have had it with you. All you have to do around here Is flush the toilet and do your homework. Do you have any idea how lucky you are? Do you? Do you?! Someday I'll be dead, and you'll wish You could hear my voice! (beep) This is the last time I'm telling you! I'm not telling you again! (beep) I will not say this one more time! (beep) So... Let that be a lesson to you. (sucks teeth) It's not my fault. The kids don't listen to me unless I yell at them. (earrings thud) I'm tired, and they push me. Mike, you see how they push me. They do. They're horrible, horrible, horrible children. (sighs) This is not who I wanted to be. Well, it's too late now. Night, honey. (grunts) I'm gonna change. Oh, no. No, don't change. I am. I'm gonna quit yelling. Mm. What, you don't think I can? I think it's gonna be like when you quit sugar. One day later I find you on the bathroom floor, Sucking frosting out of the tube. I don't want my kids growing up and saying to some shrink, "yeah, all my mom ever did my whole life was yell at me." (chuckles) They're not gonna be able to afford a shrink. Okay, guys. I've decided I don't like the way I sound on the tape. It seems like once in a while I raise my voice. Once in a while you don't raise your voice. Okay, the point is, we've gotten into a bad pattern-- I nag, you don't listen, and I end up yelling. So from now on, I will calmly ask you to do something once, Then you'll show me you can listen, And I'll show you I don't need to yell. So you're gonna stop nagging? I will start trusting that you can do the things I ask you to. What do we get if you do yell? It doesn't work that way. We should get something. That's not what this is about. How about a tootsie roll? Oh, I like waffles. That's stupid. We should get money. Okay, this is not some kind of contest for prizes. This is about us becoming the kind of family Where the mother doesn't have to yell! Starting now. I trt them, then they'll feel respected... Mm-hmm. And then respect me, in turn, by doing what they're told. It's like a trust circle. Right. Actually a trust-respect circle. Or is that an oval? I don't know. This is kind of a whole new concept, So we're still trying to figure out the shape. Yeah. (cell phone rings) Oh. That'll be my special lady. Oh. No, wait. It's my boss at little betty. He's willing to hire mike to drive the late shift wi me. Oh! That's great! Oh, my gosh. Mike will be so excited. Oh! Why don't you tell him? 
 
 (telephone rings and beeps) Hey. Hey, axl. It's bob. (whispering) axl's home? He's supposed to be at the library. Ask him if he's working on his aztec paper. So... Whatcha doing there... Buddy? Nothin'. Just hanging out. Is he watching TV? So you, uh, you watching TV? This is getting kinda creepy, bob. Ask him to tell you the difference Between the mayan and aztec cultures. (whispers) I don't know How to work that naturally into the conversation. Bob, are you talking to my mother? No. Haven't seen her. Bye. (inhales sharply) I think he's on to us. (sighs) ♪ Hits was gonna be harder than I thought. Days were passing, and who knew If they were living up to their end of the deal? They weren't saying anything, and I couldn't ask. Hey. There's my hardworking kids. Hey. There's... My kids. There's... A lot on TV this week, huh? The urge to yell and nag was building, but that's okay. I knew how to deal with it. Mike was getting ready For his first night on the job with bob, And I'd gone three whole days without screaming at my kids. Hard to say who was more miserable. (sighs) Aw, hell, was me. I'm itchy, my stomach aches And my jaw hurts from all the clenching. God, I want to yell. I want to yell so bad. Nah, you're just going through withdrawal. Mike, it's not that I enjoy yelling. I do it for the children. That's what junkies do. Anything to justify the next fix. Pretty tough talk Coming from a guy with a cupcake on his shirt. Mm. All I'm saying is, Whatever happened to the whole trust circle thing? It's a trust-respect oval, And what happened is, is that it's a load of crap. Honey, you said you wanted to trust the kids. Why don't you try actually doing it? They might surprise you. You know, this morning, sue was cleaning her room. Really? They're growing up, frankie. Cut yourself some slack And focus on what's really important-- Helping me figure out how the hell I'm gonna get through A whole night stuck in a truck with bob. So, yeah, mike thought the kids had grown up, But frankly, he said that As soon as we brought them home from the hospital. But then... Brick. Where'd you get that hat? I thought you didn't have one. Got it myself. Wore it to hat day. Was the coolest kid in school. (whispers) coolest kid. (horn honks) Oh! That's my ride. Going to majorette tryouts. You arranged your own ride? Yep. Wish me luck! Wow. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better-- The best and most amazing thing of all-- Axl was writing his history paper, On his own, Without any nagging or yelling from me. Welcome to my time, mike, When the town begins to sleep And we can prowl in the silence. Yeah, I can't really hear the silence. (cell phone alert chimes) Oh, look at that. My lady owl awakes. "hey there, pretty bird. First night on the road with my b.F.F. Mike." I'm not really sure you should do that while you drive. It's fine. I'm a fast texter. (horn honks) (tires screech) Knock it off and drive. (cell phone alert chimes) Oh. Read it to me. No. Come on. What does she say? (tires screech) Mm! (horn honks) Uh, "hey, bobby... Beast...." Since you're swerving anyway, Can you find a bridge or something and make it quick? Turns out mike was right. The kids had surprised me. I felt this new sense of freedom opening up for me, Endless possibilities, Like finally using those bath salts I got for mother's day... (splash) 2001. (doorbell rings) Can somebody get that? (ring) Has anybody got it? Hello? Anybody hear the doorbell? Yeah, it's really annoying. Hey, frankie. We're late for kiwanis. Sue was supposed to be at my house an hour ago to babysit. What? But she's at baton tryouts. She called you to cancel... Didn't she? No, she didn't. You could have reminded her, frankie. She's only a child. Here. I'll be back in a couple hours. (sighs) Brick, here. Can you sit with the baby while I get dressed? That might not be a good idea. It could get my lice. Your what? Oh, yeah. My teacher told me to give you this note. Brick, where did you get that hat? Well, you forgot to remind me to take a hat on Tuesday, So I didn't have one. But then I saw this homeless guy going through the trash, So I traded him my banana for it. (whispers) banana. Oh, my god. Brick, take that disgusting thing off your head And put it in the trash. Everybody stay away from brick's head. Axl, I need your help. We have to burn all the sheets and scrub the house down. I can't. Aztec paper's due tomorrow. What? I thought that was due next week. Yeah, I wrote that down wrong. (chuckles) You're just starting to work on this now? I told you, this is 40% of your grade. It's your future. That's why I've been working on it for the last hour. Do you even have all the supplies you need? Look it says specifically "an oxford ready-clip, clear-front report cover." Don't we have one of those? I told you, if I can't steal it from ehlert's, we don't have it. Okay, I admit it. I screwed up. Go ahead, yell at me. Oh, you'd like that now, wouldn't you? Well, I don't have the luxury. I have 11 minutes To get to office warehouse before it closes. I cannot believe how irresponsible you are. Watch this baby. (keys jangle) (cries) Oh, she's back. She's back. Tell me what she says. "I don't think this is working." Really? It's a brand-new phone. No, that's what she said. "you're a nice guy, but I think--" Hey, how about I, uh, turn this off until after we finish? What? Why? What'd she say? (sighs) it seems like she's breaking up with you. Why? Wh-why? I don't know. Yoknow who's good at talking about this kind of thing? Anybody else. I doread it to me. Read me more. Bob, this is a little persol. I think you should read it yourself. (crying) I can't. I can'see anything through the tears. Yes! (buzzer sounds) (sighs) (tapping) (speaking inaudibly) (mouth full) it's my fault. I got on her nerves. I texted her every ten minutes. (shuts engine off) Look, bob, there's a lot of girls in the world. Oh, sure, says the 7-foot god. (sniffles) What's wrong with me? I don't know. Sometimes... You're a little needy. Oh, my god! I'm needy?! (grunts) Aah! (sighs) damn it. Aah! Aah! Aah! (thud) Shut up. (pants) Aah! Get off of me. Haven't I suffered enough? I'll get o if you promise to calm down. I promise. Just let me sit up. (grunts) Aah! (sighs) Aah! (thud) When is the security guard showing up? Yeah. Okay, if I told you my kid has lice and I might have it And I'm gonnrub my head over every inch of this store, Is that gonna get him here any faster? Hello? Hello? Maybe you can win this woman back. You can go to her house right now. I can't. I don't know where she lives. I know it's somewhere in new mexico. (sighs) I should have gotten her last name Back when we were in love. Wait. Is this just some internet woman? Just? We danced for each other on ichat. She was the whole package. She had three kids, a little house, a cat. I could have walked right in and had a life. I could have been like you. So after the shift, Why don't you get some sleep, Then come by tomorrow night for some dinner? We'll put up some burgers. Really? Okay. I'd like that. Thanks, mike. Mike, can I tell you something I've never told anyone in the whole world? No. (dog barks in distance) There you are. Finally, mike showed up with the kids, To make sure I got sprung. The craigs had gotten their baby, Brick got his lice medicine, And though she hadn't heard yet, Sue was not feeling very confident About her chances of making majorettes. Yeah, well, I've had some time to think While I've been in here, And I've figured out a few things. You know, I guess there's some families somewhere Where the moms don't have to yell, But you know what? We're not one of them! Do you know why I pester and nag And get on your case and yell like a azy person?! Because nothing ever gets done if I don't! So that's what we're going back to. I don't care if it makes me look bad! (speaking inaudibly) What is she saying? I don't know. Just, uh, bow your heads. Look ashamed. Now nod. Nod like we know what she's saying.
