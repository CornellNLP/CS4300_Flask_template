Uh,  The Rainbow, Enuf, Suicide... Isn't Enuf, Isn't Enuf. It. Yeah, it  Is Enuf. No. I... I... It's  When the Rainbow Isn't Enuf. Well, the title is  When the Rainbow Is Enuf. We can argue about whether it is or isn't enough, uh, but the title is  Is Enuf. So, you flossing? Well, I mean, is that going to mean it's going to hurt? I'm a little anxious. Really? Do you want some gas, a little bit of gas? You mean like nitrous? Mm-hmm. For a cleaning? Just a little bit, take the edge off. Katrinka, will you bring the blanket and headphones in, please? We're going to get some nitrous here. There's a blanket? It's a blanket and headphones. Hi, doctor. Hello. How are you? Hi, Katrinka. I brought you music. Best medicine in the world. ♪♪ You just relax back, okay? Just like that. Perfect. There you go. I'll take you back. Mm. Coming over your head. (GAS HISSES) So do me a favor. Breathe in through your nose. Girl : Is there anybody out there? And out through your nose. Are you good? You're good. Woman : Welcome back. Welcome back. Let's take a moment to get to know our contestants, starting off with Caitlyn Jenner. Well, I'm a much televised parent of ten children. Let's walk right over to Miss Ntozake Shange and Ali... Ali Pfefferman. I'm just here to have my teeth cleaned. Bill, what have we got? Come on, get a... There you go. Good job. A J, Dr. Gunderson, a J. (BELL RINGS) Hi, Ali. Gunderson : Ali, please. Ali, open wide. (BUZZER) Oh! Sorry about that. I'd like to solve the puzzle. I would like to solve the puzzle. Both : "God is a woman." Ali? Ali, say ah. Oh, my goodness. Take a break. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Just relax. It's okay. You're doing great. You're doing great. All right, look, all I mean to say is that I found this report very hard to read. Do you understand? (CHATTER) I don't know what kind of font they use, but I would prefer Helvetica. I definitely prefer columns as opposed to bullet points. The thing that I like about bullet points... Did you see? I used Roman numerals. Hold on. Hold on. We'll work that out later. Okay. Moving on now. We're going to go to our next topic: new board members. Okay, that's fine. Let it be noted we're about to vote on potential new members Claire Strausskleiner, Hyman Glook, and Sarah Pfefferman. Duly noted. Let's start with Ms. Pfefferman. All those in favor? Uh, can we just take a minute? I'm having a feeling about Sarah Pfefferman. Woman : What's the problem? Well, okay. She's got a really dark energy. A real dark energy. I'm so sorry. I... Can you... Could you clarify "dark energy"? I'm not sure what that means. It's like dark energy that comes out in anger and in sexual ways. I... I mean, come on. She is going around celebrating divorce. I'm not sure what this has to do with... I think we're wandering into an area... It's none of our business. that it's okay, number 1, to live under the roof of the someone that I made a vow with but I don't follow the vow now. Now I can go, and I can sleep with other people. I can do things with other people. And I can tell people about it? I agree. Yeah, it's true. And that, let me tell you, is contagious. Oh, come on. I don't recall us ever evaluating a potential board member based on their... their personal life. Right? I mean, Buzzy, do you have anything that you would like to say... See what I mean? .. on Sarah Pfefferman's behalf? With all due respect, I think you are too close to this situation, and you should recuse yourself. I agree. Just to keep it clean. That makes sense to me. Okay. So why don't we just take a vote? Well... Everybody who's in favor of Sarah Pfefferman being on the board, raise your hand and say "Aye." Mm-hmm. One more little finishing touch here. Yeah. That's a lot of hair. This clip-in bang, it gives you something to play with. Oh, finally. (CHUCKLE) A bang I can play with. Wow. Vicki. Hmm. Vic? Who the f*ck are you? Raquel : Uh, Sarah? Rabbi Raquel! Are you in the kitchen? Oh, my God. Get in here. I'm dying to hear. Am I, like, the hottest sh1t that that temple has ever seen?

Okay, tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me. Sarah, um, okay. I didn't go... go our way, I guess. Just... What? What do you mean? Well, Sarah... y-you have an enemy at Mid-city. I mean, I've never seen anything like it... What are you talking about? She poisoned the board. Who? It's not ethical for me to tell you. Laura Milton-Kaufberger. Okay. What did she say? (SIGH) Sarah... What did she say? Oh. What she said is that you have a dark energy. I have a dark energy? I am so sorry. Doesn't matter. Let's let it go. Resting Bitchface said I have a dark energy? Sarah, let's move on. What was the vote? That has no bearing on this. 4-3? Honey, you don't need any of these people to have access to your spirituality. 5-2. This is about your relationship to you. All you have to do is create a space... 6-1? .. inside yourself that has nothing to do... 6-1. with any board, any temple. This is... This is all just noise. Wait. Buzzy didn't vote for me? The important thing is... Nobody voted for me? Nobody voted for me. It was... It was unanimous? Didn't you at least vote for me? I'm... I'm on the... I'm on the staff, so I'm not... I'm not allowed to vote. She's a c**t. Okay. Okay. An anorexic c**t. Okay. ♪♪ Hi, Jim Croce. What's up? Um, I found this thing, and it's, like, kind of a mess. Uh... Sounds good.

You never met her? Oh, definitely not. She's great. Go look at this. This is the real... Why is the kitchen always the most crowded place at the party? You looking for anybody in a party, check the kitchen. The kitchen is the heart of the home. Babe, you should write that down for the show. No, no, no. I have to try to... What show? .. post the photo between me and Maura on Twitter. Hold it, hold it. Please. Hello? Yes? Do not post my picture on that machine because there'll be ex-students who'll be Twitting about me. Thank you. You have nothing to worry about privacy-wise, Maura. I don't post under my real name. I don't need burglars and rapists knowing where I am. You live in a gated community, Mom. Well, haven't you heard of inside jobs? That is such a good point. Oh, oh, oh. I have 13 followers. Who here is on social? Hmm? Show of hands. Come on. Oh, see? Now you can follow me. Okay.

It's just been in this iteration for the last day because of this party, but... Did you say "in this iteration"? Yeah, we're playing around with the space. Josh : Yeah. We're rejiggering.

Are you? Yeah. I'm fine. What? What's going on? What are you talking about? You guys judging me? That is absurd. No one's judging you. No, I mean, there was a vote at... I was trying to get on the board. You didn't get on? No, I did not. I'm persona Au gratin. Wait a minute. You wouldn't have helped? I had to recuse myself. What do you mean, recuse? Recuse? I didn't vote because of my relationship with you and Sarah. Oh, this is bullshit. Cut him some slack. Excuse me. No, no, no. He's a  macher  at the temple, and he could have done something, and he didn't do it. (CLANGING) I'm really disappointed. (CLANGING) (CHATTER) (SILENCE) I'd like to propose a toast.

No, you think... You think I'm joking. I have been working so hard on this thing, and I'm telling you, nothing's... nothing's sticking. It's so bad. It's nothing I believe in. What, the Passover stuff? Yeah, Passover stuff, the G... you know, the God stuff. (SIGH) So... I mean, do you feel it? The presence of the divine? Do you feel it all the time? Remember the four words. Uh... Yes,  Rebbe. (CHUCKLE) Picture them out in the world. I picture love, justice, truth, beauty. I remember them, and it's physical. I remember them around me, and I picture them wrapping me up like a... Okay. like a garment that I try on. I feel a little rush, and, you know, you get sort of a tingle on the back of your neck. Sometimes that's all God is... is that... the feeling, and from that place, I feel like I can love. (SNIFFLE) I had a miscarriage. Then I didn't know, uh...
