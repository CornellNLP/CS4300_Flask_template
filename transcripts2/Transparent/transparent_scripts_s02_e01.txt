 Yeah. 
 Sarah's family first. 
 Come on, guys. 
 Pfeffermans. 
 Party started. 
 Come on, if you've got kids, please, I ask you to keep an eye on 'em. 
 Mom, I'm hot. 
 Okay, ready? 
 Stop right there. That's good.

 Where are we supposed to look? 
 Reggie. 
 Yeah. 
 We're doing a picture now. 
 So just now is when we need you to be focused.

 Ready to go, buddy. 
 What about Bianca, though? Where... Bianca B.? 
 Where is she? 
 B. Come on, baby. 
 Come on, you're in the picture, baby. 
 You gotta be in it. 
 It's just family.

 Everybody ready? Everybody ready? 
 Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Shelly : Ella. Ella, stop it. 
 Stop it. Rabbi Rachael. 
 She's family. Come on. 
 Ali : It's supposed to be just family. 
 [overlapping dialog] 
 You're in here. 
 Anybody else want in? 
 Lots of room. 
 Everybody's being so dramatic. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Before we melt, we gotta go, we gotta go. 
 Those little kids are melting. 
 Okay, Reggie, come on, take control. 
 Reggie. 
 Everybody ready?

 All right, let's make some space. 
 Wait. 
 Now, get in.

 Reggie. 
 Everybody ready? 
 Rabbi, can we get rid of the binder? I just... 
 Oh, sure, of course. 
 Yeah. Do you mind holding it? 
 Oh, here, here, here. 
 Got it, got it. No worries. No worries. 
 That's right, Avery said no binders, so no binders it is. 
 Everybody ready? 
 Yep. 
 We are, we are, we are. 
 Let your hear grow big like Cindy Lou down in Whoville. 
 Everybody say Cindy Lou. 
 All : Cindy Lou. 
 Oh, my gosh, guys. So serious. 
 Who's Cindy Lou? 
 Everybody say... 
 How about a Jewish reference? 
 A Jewish reference. Sure. 
 Everybody say, I want a little wine. 
 All : I want a little wine. 
 I want some apple juice. 
 Okay, Reggie. 
 Just take the pictures, for God sakes. 
 A little pejorative, right? 
 A little anti Semitic, but that's fine. 
 I'm just tryin' to lighten it up. 
 Reggie, we gotta keep it moving, I gotta get the Cashmans Hanukkah. 
 Everybody say Hanukkah. 
 All : Hanukkah. 
 Hanukkah? 
 Perfect. 
 None of these words end in a smile. 
 Okay, the Cashmans. I need the Cashmans to come over. 
 Wait, did we get this? 
 Hold on, hold on. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Hold on. Wait.

 Go back to the boat, Captain. 
 Go back to the boat. 
 Excuse me. 
 Yes? 
 Did you want my chin up, or you want my chin down? 
 Do you hear me? 
 Chin up. 
 Can you scoot in? 
 I can't hear you. 
 What'd you say? 
 Chin up, please. 
 What is he saying? 
 He says chin up. 
 A little bit. You look beautiful. 
 Oh, that's... Just a little bit down. 
 Okay, kids, keep it down. 
 One more. 
 Okay, one more. 
 Uh, I think we paid for more than one photograph. 
 If everybody focuses, we could get this picture. 
 Absolutely. Let's take the five dollar photo. 
 What is your name? 
 Reggie. 
 What is your name? 
 Reggie. 
 Reggie, you want my head up or you want my head down? 
 I think chin up for you, sir. 
 That's a head. Put your head up. 
 Reggie, take the picture. 
 He said chin up. 
 Chin up. 
 Did he call me sir? 
 Yes. 
 Just... 
 Okay, we're done, we're done.

 Okay, Cashmans. Cashmans. 
 What are you doing? What is the matter with you? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 This is the problem that I'm talking about.

 Josh : You don't have to go out of your way to make Rachael feel not welcome. 
 Ali : I'm not going out of my way to do anything, but I'm not a f*cking welcoming committee. 
 I'm just a guest at this wedding. 
 No. You're the one who tried to talk her out of being with me. 
 Okay, tonight I'm putting it in my calendar, with a Google alert, remind brother's girlfriend... 
 Good. 
 You might have been mistaken about him being a s*x addict. 
 Not tonight, though. 
 Number one. 
 Ahora. 
 Ahora? 
 Yeah. 
 Listen. 
 I'll do it. 
 We're pregnant. 
 What? What? 
 Yeah. I'm gonna be a dad. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 [groans] Hate to tell you, you already are a dad. 
 No. Not... 
 Like, I'm gonna be a dad with a baby, and I'm gonna do it right for the first time. 
 Where I actually know that I have a kid. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, but listen... 
 Okay. 
 You cannot tell anyone. 
 We just peed on a stick. It's early days. 
 I will not tell anyone. 
 He knocked her rabbi ass up? 
 Yep, he did. And you know what? 
 I'm not gonna apologize to her. 
 I don't care if she's pregnant. 
 Als, Als, please. Don't be churning stuff, okay? 
 Because this is my day. 
 I know. I know it's your day. That's what I'm saying. 
 Why did he have to pull me aside and make it all about him? 
 Why did you have to come here and tell me? 
 Now you're making it all about you. 
 Does this... the outside of my brow look ebony to you? 
 I feel like it's a little ebony. 
 Am I crazy? Did we talk about mahogany, 'cause I feel like we talked about mahogany, and this is a little ebony. 
 It's two f*ckin' kids. It's like insta-family. 
 It's a lunatic fringe festival. 
 Come on, Grandma, come on. 
 Get back here. 
 You're making me crazy. I can't run. 
 Ali : Hi, guys. 
 Shelly : Kids, you're gonna give me a heart attack. 
 Mommy, where's Daddy? 
 He's, um... He's... He's not coming. 
 Zack : I told you. 
 Ella : Why isn't he coming? 
 Zack : [singsongy] Daddy's not coming, Daddy's not coming. 
 I didn't, um... I... I didn't invite him. 
 Shelly : Kids, oy! Get off the bed. 
 Okay, kids. You know what I just realized? 
 We need to go rehearse your flower petal throwing. 
 Oh, this is terribly important. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's important, yeah. 
 Because I know she has... 
 You have the most important job in the wedding. 
 But you're not gonna compete. 
 We have to make sure it's perfect. Ready? 
 Gracie has more yellow flower petals than me. 
 We are gonna get some more yellow flower petals for you. 
 Let's go. 
 But that's not fair! 
 Shelly : Go. Go away. 
 Ella : But he's still my dad. 
 Everybody, just gai avek*. 
 She said she needed to see you. 
 I told her not to upset you. 
 Your eyebrows are too dark.

 I'm sorry, I meant to tell you that. 
 Listen, we were just nervous. 
 Sarah has no friends. She has no friends. 
 That's kind of sad. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Len got all the friends in the divorce, and Tammy has so many people. 
 So we just, you know, they're Facebook friends, and it just... we wanted to... 
 They're Facebook friends?

 Mm, thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 My God. 
 Look at you. 
 Okay. 
 Look at me. 
 Listen, uh, just to be clear. 
 I didn't think Mom could handle... this, so that's why I haven't been by to see her. 
 You didn't see her before all of this. 
 Is that why you're here, to remind me of that? 
 No, I'm here because Sarah invited me. 
 Oh. 
 I don't know why she did. 
 Nor do I, but here you are. 
 I'll take my seat. 
 Do that. 
 Before anybody tries to get it. 
 All right.

 He doesn't look like one of us. 
 You're gonna ask me again? We had the DNA test. 
 He's Joshy's. That build comes from Rita's father. 
 He was a Norwegian shot-putter, apparently.

 Man : Everyone, please be seated. 
 The ceremony is about to begin. 
 Well, was sh... she at least cordial to you? 
 No. Is a lizard cordial? 
 She's a filing cabinet with a hairdo. 
 I mean, she hated me when I was male, and... and, you know, and when she was little, she used to accuse me of wearing her clothes. 
 Did you? 
 Of course, I did, but... 
 Listen, she's gone on record as being anti gay, so I don't know what the f*ck she's doing here. 
 The free food. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Not the free food. Get a gander at this. 
 Oh. 
 That's why she's here. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh. Oh. 
 Look at you. You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Thanks. 
 Whenever you're ready. 
 I have a question. 
 Yeah? 
 Did you... did you invite Aunt Bri here? 
 Yeah. 
 How can you... 
 Why did you do that? 
 Because I don't have any people. 
 How can you do that to me? 
 We don't... 
 We're your people. 
 Huh? I don't understand. 
 And you're... you're Facebook friends? 
 If she's a little anxious today, it's understandable. 
 I was anxious on my wedding day, too. 
 I was hopped up on diet pills. 
 You know what? Brina could have brought Grandma Rose. 
 That would have been beautiful. 
 Yes, it would have been beautiful, but Grandma Rose is sick and she's in a wheelchair. 
 Oh, okay, so she's in a wheelchair. 
 People in wheelchairs go places. 
 I was at Disneyland and we were on the Small World ride, and there was a woman with a wheelchair on the ride. 
 With... with an oxygen tank. 
 I mean, if you love people, you can take them places. 
 Okay, good. Well, by all means, let's do what they do at Small World. 
 [guitar playing Wagner's Lohengren "Bridal Chorus"] 
 [exhales] 
 You took diet pills? 
 You knew that. 
 No, I didn't know that. 
 That's why the house was so clean. 
 Is that why you fired Nobby? 
 No, no. Well, partly, but I just wanted to save us some of the money because I could do it myself. 
 All right. 
 Sarah. 
 Thanks, Dad.
