 It's my opinion that a custody practice called bird nesting is the best course of action. 
 Great. Yeah. Driving back and forth from the Palisades to Los Feliz... 
 I'll tell you, it's done severe psychological damage to the kids, like PTSD, you know? 
 Ella now probably has a fear of weddings, thank you. 
 Man : Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Zachary and Ella will stay at the Los Feliz residence while each of you takes turns cohabitating with them. 
 Sarah, I recommend you rent an apartment nearby. 
 Now, some couples share their secondary apartment. 
 That's not going to happen. 
 f*ck, no. 
 Man : I'd like to recommend a schedule of 2-2-3. 
 24 Hour Fitness available across the street. 
 Monday, Tuesday is Sarah. 
 Wednesday, Thursday Len. 
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday, you alternate. 
 ...bathroom, convertible shower heads... 
 The Los Feliz house now belongs to your kids. 
 Woman : Uh, on-site... 
 It's time for Zachary and Ella to get their lives back. 
 No more chaos. 
 You have controlled access elevators.

 Teacher : When we look up at the sky, we're not seeing the universe as it is today but as it was hundreds, thousands, millions of years ago. 
 The multitudinous past of every star sending photons hurtling through space, each one a clue as to our origins. 
 What you are looking at is the past. 
 [throbbing] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hurry. I got a target heartrate to maintain. 
 What do you think about this? 
 No. No. 
 Ooh, wait a minute. How about this? 
 What's that black and white one? 
 This one, is this too water aerobics? 
 No. 
 No? 
 No, it's very nice, especially with the right sandal. 
 Oh, God. People don't even swim at pool parties. 
 Can you help me? 
 I can't... 
 Here I come to save the day. 
 It's okay. Don't worry. 
 You're going to look great. 
 Ahem. I like this one. 
 Shelly : Oi. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, Mrs. P! 
 Yeah. 
 You don't by chance have a timeline on this storage unit here, do you? 
 No. Why? 
 Rosalie Rollman issued a formal complaint about it to the condo board. 
 Rosalie Rollman can kiss my ass. 
 She wants a special assessment for the pond. 
 Here's my special assessment for the fakacteh fershtunkiner pond. 
 Drain the fucker! 
 Glad to see you're working out. 
 Like we all need duck and goose sh1t everywhere. 
 [laughing] Rosalie Rollman. 
 I'm going... I'm going to move this, this whole thing, all right? 
 Because you don't deserve to be a pariah here. 
 It's not a big problem. 
 This makes me feel like a vagabond anyway. 
 Ah. You will do no such thing. 
 I like you and the box right here.

 Hello. 
 Hey. It's been a while. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Uh, you're... you're stopping by. 
 I'm stopping by. Just a casual stop-by. 
 All right, well, come on in. 
 Nice haircut. 
 Why, thank you very much. 
 That's an interesting braid. It's like... 
 Okay. 
 Did you join, like, a New Wave, like, polygamous cult? 
 A little Punk House On the Prairie? 
 How did I not see this coming? 
 It's also, like, a little bit like a fly fishing lure. 
 It's just this is the back end, you know? 
 Like A River Runs Through It. 
 [laughter] 
 You just, like, toss you out into the river and catch a fish. 
 Are you done? 
 I have one more. 
 Okay. 
 I feel like I could also, like, set up a badminton net in here and use your head like a shuttlecock. 
 Sorry. 
 You just wanted to say shuttlecock. 
 Yeah. It's cute. 
 Thank you. 
 From this angle. 
 Are you done making fun of me? 
 Never. 
 Isn't that why you came back? 
 I guess so. 
 I also very much have been wanting to say that I'm sorry and that I... I hope you will take me as your friend again. 
 I will take you as my friend again. 
 Okay, let's be friends. 
 Uh, okay. 
 Short notice. 
 I'm having people over tonight. 
 Low key. We're going to play Mafia, do a bunch of hard drugs. Not really. 
 Um, do you want to come? 
 Woman : Tell me more about Danielle. 
 Yeah, she, uh, she's Mrs. Ambition. 
 She's, like, the right hand lady to the CEO, so, I mean, she was hired as just an admin, and... 
 Rita : Leo Carrillo? 
 Hmm? 
 Leo Carrillo? 
 What's... What... What? 
 Leo Carrillo. The beach. 
 He said you were going swimming. 
 Oh. The beach. 
 We used to go there. 
 Got it. No. 
 We're having a thing at the house, a pool thing. 
 Oh, a pool thing. 
 It's an industry party.

 Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you. 
 I'm thinking about staying in Los Angeles for senior year. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. Were Rita and your parents cool with that? 
 Yeah, my parents are totally cool with it. 
 And actually, it was Rita's idea. 
 She says she feels greedy, you know, for me, seeing as she hasn't had me till now. 
 Right. 
 Hey, guys. Hey, Colton. 
 Hey, Rabbi. 
 Look at your swim trunks. 
 You ready for a pool party? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Come on in the front seat. 
 You're riding shotgun with those long legs of yours. 
 No. I'll squish them. I don't mind. 
 I appreciate it. 
 I insist. 
 Yo, go, go, go, go, go, go. 
 Come here.

 Shelly : Beautiful. 
 They're gorgeous. You got boobies. 
 Well, no. 
 I never saw boobies before. 
 I've never worn boobies. 
 Oh, you're wearing them. 
 I could even bump it up one size. 
 You could. 
 Because I'm tall. 
 Yeah.

 It's skin. You can't tighten skin. 
 Looks good, right? 
 Oh, it's much better. 
 I'll put the hair up. 
 The hair up is gorgeous.
