 [Sighs] 
 What the f*ck is high fem anyway? 
 Is this high fem? Lace? 
 No, that's like what you're wearing when they find your body in a motel room. 
 That's not... that. 
 You know, just a little word of advice. 
 Kind of creeps guys out when you bring luggage over on the first date. 
 It's not luggage, it's a bag. 
 It's just an extra bag. 
 I don't know what we're gonna do. 
 Is this high fem? Is this good? 
 No, that's Holly Hobby. 
 I don't get it the high fem thing. 
 Okay, I'm low fem. Me. Low fem. 
 Right? 
 Okay, so what am I? 
 You're, like, Middle Earth fem. 
 Like,  The Hobbit? 
 No, like people that live under the subway. 
 Like mole people fem. 
 Okay, like that? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Okay, I don't want to hurt you. 
 That's good. 
 Whoa. 
 Whoa. That is boobage. 
 Right? 
 Like spilling out. 
 You have total cleavage. 
 I totally do. 
 Okay. Yeehaw. 
 I like it. 
 I like it. 
 All right, suck it in. 
 You look hot as sh1t, Al. 
 Look at this. It's torture. 
 It... it's torture in a dress. 
 Like, I just want to... I, like... 
 Just bring me out there in a noose. 
 I'm not doing my bat mitzvah. 
 What are you talking about? That... that's a beautiful dress. 
 It's a terrible dress. 
 I disagree with you. 
 Honest, do you actually believe in God? 
 That has nothing to do with your bat mitzvah, but, um, you know. 
 [Sighs] 
 I sometimes have conflict. 
 You know, sometimes I just... 
 I wonder if there's, um... 
 You know, with the pain and suffering and... 
 I struggle with it. 
 So if there is no God, I mean, honestly, like everything we do, no one sees it. 
 I say cancel the fucker. 
 Do you have any idea how much money we're going to lose? 
 I don't give a sh1t about money, I care about what's right. 
 It's a week away. What am I supposed to do? 
 I lost the deposits already, all of them. 
 Maybe if our little heathen in there had had her revelation a few months ago... 
 Nellie, it's gonna be less money if we just cancel it now. 
 Please? 
 You know what? 
 I already paid three grand for the invitations, the postage alone. What am I supposed to do here? 
 You're not supposed to do anything. 
 It's not your bat mitzvah. 
 It most certainly is. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 I want you to be a man, and save the goddamn day. 
 ♪ [Piano] 
 Bueno, bueno. Me gusto. 
 Quiero que ustedes poner esos en el truck por favor. 
 Hey, babe. 
 Hey! 
 Oh, my God. 
 I know, right? 
 Wow. 
 [Vocalizing] 
 You know, the pony wall's gone. 
 Pony? What the hell's a pony wall? 
 My mom call... Isn't it called a pony wall? 
 I don't know, but it is now gonna be called the open-the-fuck-up railing. 
 It does. It opens it. 
 [Singsongy] Celebration weekend. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, right. 
 A magic f*ckin' miracle. 
 We're finally gettin' our custody schedules aligned. 
 No kids. 
 Yeah, but don't forget, we also have to go to the talent show tonight. 
 Oh, right. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 What? 
 Joshy's Michael Jackson glove. 
 Really? 
 f*ckin' holy... 
 We looked for this. He cried. 
 Uh-huh. 
 He used to do these moon walk shows for me right before bedtime. 
 [Gasps] His pirate treasure box. 
 This thing is cool. Did you see this? 
 What? 
 You were gonna throw this out, right? 
 Babe, check with me. See how it folds? 
 I love this thing.

 I mean, I just want to justify. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Hey-oh! 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Look at this. 
 Good to see you. 
 How are you, handsome? 
 Yeah. 
 Lookin' good. Oh, hello. 
 Hi. 
 You're a beautiful lady. 
 Thank you. 
 My sister. 
 I'm Sarah. 
 Hey, I called your guys for the hookup for those, uh... 
 Wisebury panic tickets and they said it was a no-go. 
 What's up? 
 I know, bro. I'm sorry. 
 Can't help you in that department right now. 
 I'm just, uh... Some sh1t went down at work. 
 Uh-oh. 
 He kinda got fired. 
 But when I get my new label goin', it's gonna be major. 
 Well, let's see what we got. Let's get down to brass tacks. 
 What do you think is the worst out of these things? 
 'Cause you checked a bunch. 
 Anxiety. Irritable bowel syndrome. 
 Really? For such a pretty lady. 
 Such an upset tummy. 
 Yeah, it's sort of hard to say. 
 Like this weekend I don't have my kids for the first time, like, ever in their whole lives, 'cause I had this recent separation and it's kind of... 
 But it's like I... But I... 
 I don't really... I mean, I don't really feel that. But I... I don't know. 
 Like, I guess I'm, like, really revved up during the day, and then when I try to sleep at night, I can't get to sleep, but... 
 I mean, it's so funny, like, I am the happiest I've ever been in my life. 
 So this, like, totally doesn't make sense. 
 You seem very anxious. 
 I do? 
 Yeah. I mean, sexy but anxious. 
 Oh, thank you. How soon do I get the pot? 
 Oh, no, it's not pot. We call it medicine. 
 f*cking talent show? 
 What? And the dude had no talent whatsoever. 
 What... what talent did he acquire now that he's a chick? 
 And why did you tell him without talking to me? 
 How many f*cking little league games has he gone to for you? 
 How many hours has he wasted of his life? 
 You can give him one. 
 That's his job as a father. 
 That's what he's supposed to do. 
 Oh, my God, I had forgotten how much I love this. 
 Yeah. 
 This... this is legal. 
 I have a bag. I have a f*cking bag of sh1t. 
 This is way stronger than what you remember from college. 
 You have no idea what's in store for you. 
 It's called a... What is this one? 
 It's like Jedi kush. 
 We didn't have f*ckin' names. 
 Pink revisions? What the f*ck is that? 
 Oh, my God, I'm sorry, I'm bogarting this whole thing. 
 Do you want some? 
 I'm... I'm not... 
 You don't want any? 
 I'm trying not to pile f*cked up on top of freaked out. 
 You're not okay with all this sh1t with dad. 
 I don't know what I am. 
 I didn't know whether you were a leg man or a boob man, so I... 
 Don't talk. 
 Just let me look at you. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 When you talk to me, I want you to say daddy at the end of it every f*ckin' time. 
 What do you want me to do, daddy? 
 Hike up that skirt. 
 Let me see those panties. 
 Pull 'em down to your knees. 
 Daddy, normally I would object to the use of the word panties. 
 Shut the f*ck up. You talk too much. 
 What the f*ck is all that? 
 Big girls have bush, daddy. 
 Not all of 'em do. 
 We're gonna f*ckin' fix that. 
 When you came in, I kind of thought you were gonna have the yarmulke on. 
 Is that ridiculous? 
 It's not stapled. 
 I don't staple it on my head. 
 No. 
 I didn't want to throw you off with too much jewiness on a first date. 
 I just want to sneak a peak. 
 Just like a little bit. 
 Can I? 
 Oh, my God. Look at this. 
 Okay, I'm gonna do this. 
 Here we go. 
 That's right. It goes back. 
 I usually have my hair up, but... 
 See? It's not so sexy. 
 I... I don't know. 
 Sexier. 
 Mm. 
 Not so sexy. 
 Sexy. Not so sexy. 
 Sexy. Not sexy. 
 So sexy. 
 It's sexy. Either way.

 You gotta let the dick choose you. 
 Keep lookin' around. 
 Sparkly unicorn. 
 That's... That's what you want? 
 Yes. 
 Hi. 
 Here, let me get this. 
 Oh, this is on me, daddy. 
 What? 
 Daddy. 
 Um, hold on a second. 
 Wait, wait. 
 I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on. 
 This is embarrassing, and it's never happened to me before. 
 That's okay. That's totally fine. 
 There is... I'm not worried about anything. 
 That's... This is okay. 
 All right, 'cause I kinda want to be like... 
 [Laughs] 
 Okay, I'm... I'm... I have a fear that I'm just gonna name, 'cause I'm just... I'm... I'm a namer. 
 Please. 
 Uh, my... my mentor talked about how sometimes rabbis... anybody, like, priests, people just project their... 
 Al their God sh1t on you. 
 Oh, God, no, no. 
 So I'm just like a walking yarmulke, you can't ever get a hard on in front of me. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 No, no, no. It is not you. 
 My father is my mother right now and I'm... 
 I'm... in my head I'm, like, basically afraid I'm never gonna get a hard on again. Like ever. 
 Tonight, I'm suppose... My sister wants me to go to this talent show. 
 Trans talent. 
 My dad's gonna be in it, he's gonna be wearing a f*cking dress. 
 Do you want me to go with you? 
 No. No, no, no. 
 Uh, mainly, I don't know what I'm gonna see. 
 How about this. 
 You go. 
 Mmhm. 
 I will empty out your fridge, try to make something that we can eat, to have it here when you get back. 
 What on earth is left to rape? 
 What flowers? What two lips? 
 What... 
 Great, uh, cut to the end. 
 Free Palestine.

 Okay. 
 Well, uh, good luck. 
 Oh, thank you. Thank you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What are you... 
 Why are you so... 
 You know, actually, they don't say good luck. 
 They say,  break a leg. 
 Because, uh, if you say good luck that's bad luck. 
 Oh, well, then, break a leg, then. 
 I'm not good at this. 
 All right, well, then, break a leg. 
 Break a leg. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, my God. Show garment.

 I'm just gonna grab a drink.

 Oh, and also, he's trans. 
 f*cking Ali, Jesus Christ. 
 That's bullshit. 
 Not bullshit. 
 Wait, that dude wants to become a woman? 
 That dude was a woman. 
 No way. 
 Did he have the lower surgery? 
 He didn't. 
 Lower surgery? 
 Still has a v*g1n*. 
 What? 
 That... 
 Um, I just realized something. 
 That means that four out of five Pfeffermans now prefer pussy. 
 I believe it should be pfour out of pfive Pfeffermans... 
 Hey. 
 Prefer pfpussy. 
 Say it, don't spray it. 
 Wait, mom's the only one left who likes cock.
