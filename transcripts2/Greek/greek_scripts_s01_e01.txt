 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES UNIVERSITY - The camera cuts to lots of different shots of life around campus. We see many different students walking around, we see the Fraternity and Sorority houses and finally the camera moves rapidly between lots of groups of students before focusing on Rusty. We see Rusty look around and take in the surrounding at Cyprus Rhodes] 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES UNIVERSITY - Rusty is at an enrolling desk with many other students queuing behind him. He is talking to a man who is helping him to enrol] 
 Rusty 
Hi! I'm Rusty Cartwright. 
 [The man checks his list for the name] 
 Rusty 
I'm a freshman. 
 [Rusty gives a large smile to the man] 
 Rusty 
College. Pretty exciting, huh? 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES UNIVERSITY - Rusty is sitting in front of a blue screen having his photo taken by a photographer. The photographer takes three photos of Rusty and he has his eyes closed in all of them. In the fourth photo Rusty has his eyes open and we see this photo being printed off and used as the photo ID in his Cyprus Rhodes University student ID card] 
 [EXT ZBZ HOUSE] 
 [INT ZBZ HOUSE - Casey is standing in front and addressing the ZBZ sorority who are sitting on the stairs in front of her. She is standing at the front with Ashleigh and another ZBZ sister] 
 Casey 
Tomorrow night, we are going to host over a thousand girls for rush. We're going to get all types; we're the best so of course we accept nothing less. 
 [Frannie sits on the stairs and smiles proudly at Casey] 
 Casey 
Now, what can you tell me about Ashleigh just from her appearance? 
 [Casey gestures towards Ashleigh. Ashleigh then poses with her hand on her hip. The girls all look at each other and they clearly don't know the answer] 
 Casey 
Anyone? There are four things that I see right away. 
 [The ZBZ sister standing next to Casey turns to inspect Ashleigh. Casey then points to Ashleigh's shirt] 
 Casey 
One: the stain on the right side of her theory shirt means she's sloppy. 
 [Ashleigh looks down and inspects her shirt. Casey then walks around to the other side of Ashleigh. The ZBZ girls are all paying close attention] 
 Casey 
Two: her Marc Jacob's skirt looks brand new but is last season. So I'm guessing clearance rack raid. 
 [Casey crosses back over to the other side of Ashleigh. Ashleigh turns her right foot sideways] 
 Casey 
Three: her Prada shoes while quite nice are too big for her feet. Probably on loan from a friend with better taste and a bit more money 
 [The ZBZ sisters all smile bitchily at this] 
 Casey 
Or- 
 [Casey is interrupted by the ZBZ sister standing next to her. She is waving her hand wildly and is desperate to say the next one] 
 ZBZ Sister 
Oh! Oh! Oh! 
 [The ZBZ sister gestures towards Ashleigh's face] 
 ZBZ Sister 
The bags under her eyes; she's a party girl who is probably still drunk from last night. 
 [Ashleigh exclaims and laughs at this] 
 Ashleigh 
That's all true! 
 [The ZBZ sisters all applaud now that the demonstration is over. Ashleigh and the ZBZ sister both go and sit on the stairs with their fellow ZBZ sisters. Casey is still standing in front of everyone at the bottom of the stairs] 
 Casey 
Speaking of, when talking to rushees do not discuss drinking, drugs or s*x. 
 [Ashleigh is now sitting at the stairs and puts up her hand to ask a question] 
 Ashleigh 
What if they ask about it? 
 Casey 
We have a reputation to uphold... lie! 
 [The ZBZ sisters all start laughing] 
 Casey 
Remember, I don't care if she's the lamest fattest girl in the room. Your mission is to make every girl who walks through that front door wanna kill to be your best friend. 
 Casey 
Clear? 
 [Frannie now stands up from her position on the stairs. She walks down the stairs and stands alongside Casey] 
 Frannie 
Why don't we break the day? Maybe we could go to the retirement centre, spread some cheer and work up on our philanthropy hours. 
[The ZBZ sisters all smile fakely at Frannie. Frannie now starts laughing widely and her ZBZ sisters laugh too realising that that was a joke] 
 Frannie 
I know I'm like a stand up comedian all of a sudden, right? 
 [Frannie starts laughing again] 
 Frannie 
Rush just makes me so rowdy! Everyone with an ID, fake or real, meet me at Doblers in exactly one hour. Move out! 
 [The ZBZ sisters start to dissemble and leave the stairs. Frannie turns and grabs Casey by both hands] 
 Frannie 
Casey, walk with me. 
 [Frannie links arms with Casey and they walk up the stairs together] 
 Frannie 
Oh came to play, I'm impressed. 
 Casey 
Frannie please, this is rush. 
 Frannie 
So, I have some inside scoop. Rebecca Logan, daughter of our fair state senator is coming here this fall and she's rushing. I want her, having a senator's daughter could do so much for us. 
 Casey 
That's as good as a Bush twin. 
 Frannie 
 But without the whole war thing. 
 Casey 
Having a high profile pledge like her puts more alumni money into the party fund. 
 [Casey and Frannie have now made it upstairs and have stopped walking] 
 Frannie 
Exactly! The sluts at Tri Pi have already taken her to Canyon Lakes so we have to up our game. Sell our reputation and sell the fact that we have a direct line to the hottest guys on campus. From what I hear she's a little boring, so give her all the help you can. Maybe regroup that stud boyfriend of yours and some of his Omega Chi brothers. 
 Casey 
No worries, it's in the bag. 
Frannie 
And Casey, as you know I'm graduating this spring and seriously considering who will be my successor. Being president of Zeta Beta is the most- 
 Casey 
-Prestigious honour offered at this college. 
 Frannie 
It tells the world that you are the best of the best. It changed my life. 
 Casey 
You're campus royalty now. 
 [Frannie grabs both of Casey's hands] 
 Frannie 
Land Rebecca Logan and you could be the heir to my throne. 
 [Frannie smiles at Casey and then walks away. Casey smiles and then looks down at the house from the top of the staircase. Casey's moment is ruined when her phone goes off. She picks it up, sighs and then answers it] 
 Casey 
Call you later. 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES - Rusty is holding a map and surrounded by lots of students moving around him] 
 Rusty 
Casey, wait do you know where- 
 [INT ZBZ HOUSE - Casey is still standing at the top of the staircase and she snaps her phone shut] 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES - Rusty looks at the phone and then puts it down. He stares at the map and the camera zooms out. The camera keeps zooming out until Rusty can not be seen; all that is seen is the university and the word "GREEK" appears on the screen] 
 Credits 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES] 
 [INT RUSTY AND DALE'S ROOM - We see Rusty open and walk through the door. He looks around the first time and spots a bible and a crucifix on the wall. Dale walks through the door now and is carrying a box of his stuff. Rusty turns and sees his new roommate for the first time] 
 Dale 
I'm Dale 
 [Rusty puts out his hand for Dale to shake but Dale simply nudges Rusty's arm] 
Dale 
Alright 
 Rusty 
Hey Dale! Nice to meet you. 
 [Dale reaches his side of the bedroom and he puts his box down] 
 Dale 
A Yankee, huh? 
 Rusty 
Ah I guess. I'm from Chicago. I never realised people still used that word. 
 [Rusty reaches his side of the bedroom and he sets down his backpacks] 
 Dale 
Oh I didn't mean anything by it. I mean you've gotta be pretty smart to get into the Honours Engineering programme. 
 Rusty 
How'd you know that? 
 Dale 
This is the Honours Engineering floor. 
 [Dale walks over to a wall in the centre of the bedroom. He starts to hang up a confederate flag] 
 Dale 
It seems kinda weird putting us all in here together considering how competitive the programme can get but you don't have to worry I'm not into that stuff. I'm just really confident when it comes to my grades. Graduate with a 3.7, got a 2110 in my SATs. 
 [Dale is juggling a football between his hands and Rusty is transfixed by the flag on the wall] 
 Rusty 
Cool 
 [Dale throws the football over to Rusty] 
 Dale 
What about you? How'd you do? 
 Rusty 
Ah, 3.9 something and 2280. 
 [Rusty passes the football back to Dale and starts to head back to his bed. Dale looks devastated that Rusty got better grades than him] 
Dale 
Right, right. Are you going to the big freshmen orientation party tonight? 
 Rusty 
Party? College party? 
 Dale 
Yeah. It sounds great. 
 [Rusty is now smiling and raises his hand for Dale to give him a high five. Dale simply looks at Rusty's hand awkwardly] 
 Dale 
Germs. 
 [Rusty remains frozen in the same position] 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES UNIVERSITY] 
 [INT CYPRUS RHODES - A CLASSROOM - There is a sign on the wall saying, "Department of Engineering Welcomes You".  Rusty and Dale are surrounded by other geeks and they are all watching the table in front of them. On the table there are two robot toys fighting and two of the geeks are moving the robots with their controllers. All the geeks including Dale are really excited although Rusty is standing there with a mixture of shock and boredom on his face] 
 Dale 
Fantastic 
 [We see that one of the robots is destroying its competitor] 
 [EXT DOBLERS - There is a large group of students crowded outside] 
 [INT DOBLERS - Ashleigh and Casey are both sitting at the bar. They both have shots in their hands] 
 Ashleigh 
Okay, here is to the future madam president. 
 [They both raise their shot glasses and knock them together. They both then knock back their shots in one] 
 Casey 
Nothing is definite yet but this is seriously what I wanted since I came to Cyprus Rhodes. It's huge for me. 
 [Ashleigh is eating the potato chips which are placed in a bowl in front of her] 
 Ashleigh 
And now it's yours for the taking. 
[Ashleigh spots something over Casey's shoulder and makes a shocked face] 
 Ashleigh 
Oh, good lord. 
 [Casey turns around to see what Ashleigh is talking about and she sees Cappie. Cappie is dressed only in boxer shorts and a cowboy hat. Casey turns back around to face Ashleigh] 
 Casey 
What the hell is that idiot doing? 
 Ashleigh 
Good thing y'all never dated. Oh wait, you did! 
 [Casey makes an annoyed face. Ashleigh smiles and then eats another potato chip] 
 Casey 
You sure are eating a lot of chips Ash. Rush starts tomorrow. 
 [Ashleigh drops the chip that she had started eating] 
 Ashleigh 
I gotta go to the bathroom. 
 [Ashleigh gets off her chair and walks away. Casey turns and makes a face at Ashleigh leaving and Cappie walks past her. Casey turns back to see that Cappie is now sitting in Ashleigh's seat. Casey looks at him and Cappie smiles and makes a kissing noise] 
 Casey 
Have you no self respect? 
 Cappie 
In my book you have to respect yourself a lot to show off your package this early before Christmas. 
 [Casey gives him a flirtatious smile] 
 Cappie 
Takes you back doesn't it? 
 Casey 
Oh yeah, to do those drunken nights at the Kappa Tau house. Having the choice of watching you get stoned or watching Old School for the 900th time. 
 [Cappie laughs and Casey stand up and moves to get away. Cappie stands up to prevent her from leaving him] 
 Cappie 
Don't go getting all nostalgic on me. Look, Case the reason I broke up with you- 
 Casey 
-I dumped you. 
 Cappie 
And the important thing is that we can both love again. 
 [They both smile at each other and are obviously flirting. Evan walks up and notices this; he puts his arm around Casey to show possession] 
 Evan 
Hey Crappie! 
 Cappie 
The name's Cappie. 
 Evan 
Mmm, and for that I truly am sorry. 
 [Casey and Evan are holding hands. Evan looks at Cappie's topless form] 
 Evan 
I mean I thought you Kappa Tau boys knew how to dress yourselves. 
 Cappie 
Well Evan, we Kappa Tau boys spend so much time with our clothes off we just figured, why bother? Your girlfriend and I were just talking about that actually. 
 [Casey and Evan start kissing. Cappie watches them and looks annoyed] 
 Cappie 
Well that's my cue. Always a pleasure. 
 [Cappie tips his hat at them before walking off and leaving them alone] 
 Evan 
What were you thinking? 
 Casey 
I was young and naïve. 
 [Casey and Evan start kissing again but break apart when Casey's phone starts ringing. Casey answers it.] 
 Casey 
Call you later Rusty. Promise. 
 [INT RUSTY AND DALE'S ROOM - Rusty is sitting at a desk and is on the phone to Casey] 
Rusty 
No, no, no wait! 
 [INT DOBLERS - Casey and Evan are still at the bar. Casey has now hung up on Rusty] 
 Casey 
Uh, my stupid brother. 
 Evan 
You have a brother? 
 INT RUSTY AND DALE'S ROOM - Rusty is sitting at a desk and reading a book entitled "Fraternities & Sororities: A Beginners Guide"] 
 [EXT ZBZ HOUSE] 
 [INT ZBZ HOUSE - Rusty walks in through the front door] 
 Rusty 
Casey? 
 [Rusty walks to the bottom of the stairs. We hear a door open upstairs] 
 ZBZ Sister 
Boy in the house! 
 [EXT ZBZ HOUSE - Rusty and Casey walk out to the ZBZ lawn] 
 Rusty 
You didn't tell them you had a brother. 
 Casey 
Rusty! What are you doing here? 
 Rusty 
You wouldn't return my calls. What was I supposed to do? 
 Casey 
Okay, I know we have to figure out this new situation at some point. I accept that you go here now, it's... ah... 
 Rusty 
A given? 
 Casey 
I'd like to say unavoidable but that's too harsh. 
 Rusty 
Inevitable? 
Casey 
That's it! You being here is inevitable. So I thought maybe I could coordinate a monthly brunch, we get together catch up; I'm totally willing to do that. 
 Rusty 
You might not have to. I've decided that I want to rush a fraternity. 
 Casey 
No! 
 Rusty 
Why not? 
 Casey 
Ahh...because guys in fraternities are hot and they have upper bodies. They don't study engineering. 
 Rusty 
Polymer science! 
 Casey 
See, guys in fraternities would kick your ass for just saying polymer science. 
 Rusty 
It's not like I'm saying I want to join your sorority. Look, I was at an engineering party last night with my roommate who I suspect is kinda racist and we stood around a multipurpose room talking about the theoretical scientific inconsistencies of The Matrix. 
 Casey 
And this weird for you because? 
 Rusty 
There were robots Casey! Robots! Look, I wanna have a real college experience. I wanna have fun. 
 Casey 
You don't know how to have fun! 
 Rusty 
But I can learn. Isn't that what college is for? 
 Casey 
Hell no! You and I, we've always stayed in our respective worlds. I never crashed one of your gay camp sleepovers. 
 Rusty 
Wilderness excursions! 
 Casey 
Whatever! My point is, you have your world and I have mine. 
 Rusty 
But I don't have a world anymore. Please! Help me! 
 Casey 
I'm trying to help you buy you're not fraternity material. You're just gonna be disappointed. 
 Rusty 
I'm gonna do it Casey. 
 Casey 
We'll do brunches. 
 [Casey gives Rusty the thumbs up and then turns around and starts walking back to the ZBZ house] 
 Rusty 
I'm gonna join a fraternity! 
 [Rusty throws his arm into the air and Casey turns around and looks embarrassed by Rusty's display. She carries on walking into the house, leaving Rusty alone on the ZBZ lawn]         
 [EXT LAMBDA SIGMA OMEGA - Its night time and Rusty is surrounded by a group of male freshmen including Calvin. They are being led to the Lambda Sigma Omega house by a tour guide. The freshmen are all dressed casually apart from Rusty who is wearing a suit and tie] 
 Tour Guide 
Eyes and ears on me. The first house that we will be visiting tonight is Lambda Sigma Omega. 
 [Rusty looks over at the other freshmen and sees how overdressed he is. Rusty pulls off his suit jacket and throws it on top of a hedge. Calvin watches Rusty and smiles. Rusty loosens up his tie and then goes and stands next to Calvin] 
 Tour Guide 
Over the next couple of hours we will be visiting all fourteen houses on campus. So, if you have any last minute letters of recommendation be sure you get them out tonight. 
Hold onto those letters of recommendation until you get to the house of your first choice. 
 [Rusty looks around and sees all the other freshmen getting out many letters of recommendation. He turns to Calvin who is holding a lot of letters] 
 Rusty 
Letters of recommendation? Is he serious? 
 Calvin 
They're not required, more of an unspoken assessment. Weed out. 
 Rusty 
Medical school admissions are less involved than this. 
 Calvin 
Welcome to the Greece's. 
 [INT LAMDA SIGMA OMEGA HOUSE - We see Rusty and Calvin talking to a member of the Lambda Sigma Omega fraternity. The Lambda Sigma Omega house is very sports orientated and we can see someone playing with a football and sport is being shown on a plasma TV. Around Rusty and Calvin we see the freshmen and fraternity members mingling] 
 Calvin 
So how important is athletics to the Omega Sig's? 
 Lambda Sigma Omega Member 
Real important. We're intramural champs for 4 years in a row. You guys play football? 
 Rusty 
Oh I played for a year... in little league. 
 [It goes silent for a moment and everyone is at loss for what to say] 
 Calvin 
Uh, I was all state quarterback for my high school. The university courted me but I opted out a plan so that I could focus on sports medicine. 
 Lambda Sigma Omega Member 
What was your name again? 
 Calvin 
Calvin Owens. 
 [Calvin and the Lambda Sigma Omega member shake hands whilst Rusty watches] 
 Calvin 
Glad to meet you. 
 Lambda Sigma Omega Member 
Let me introduce you around. 
 [The Lambda Sigma Omega member grabs Calvin by the arm and leads him away. Rusty is left behind alone] 
 [INT FRATERNITY HOUSE - Rusty and Calvin are now in another fraternity house. They are talking to a member of the fraternity. In this fraternity the members appear to be very attractive model types. Around Rusty and Calvin we see the freshmen and fraternity members mingling] 
 Rusty 
So you guys have some raging toga parties, huh? 
 Fraternity Member 
No. 
 [The fraternity member ignores Rusty and turns his attention onto Calvin] 
 Fraternity Member 
Anyway, wax is okay but when it builds up in your hair. 
 Calvin 
See I learned this trick when I modelled in Milan, if you just- 
 Fraternity Member 
You modelled in Milan? 
 Calvin 
Oh nothing major. Just a couple summers. I was offered a deal with Abercrombie but I turned it down so I could come here and study communications. 
 Fraternity Member 
That's what I'm studying! 
 [Rusty looks confused by Calvin's lies] 
 Calvin 
Get out 
 Fraternity Member 
Calvin, right? 
 [Calvin and the fraternity member shake hands. Rusty is annoyed by Calvin's actions] 
 [INT JEWISH FRATERNITY HOUSE - Rusty and Calvin walk through the doors and face a large crowd] 
 Calvin 
Shalom! 
 [The fraternity brothers look at Calvin. Calvin takes out a kippah and places it onto his head] 
 Calvin 
Calvin Rosenberg. 
 [EXT ZBZ HOUSE] 
[INT ZBZ HOUSE - The ZBZ's are hosting their mixer party and we see the sisters socialising with the freshmen. We see Casey talking to Jenn K] 
 Jenn K 
I really love travelling places with beaches and sand. 
 Casey 
Yeah, sand's great. 
 [Frannie walks up and joins them] 
 Frannie 
Excuse me. Casey can I borrow you a sec? 
 [Frannie takes Casey by the arm and leads her away] 
 Casey 
Thank you! That girl was verbally handicapped. 
 Frannie 
Rebecca Logan's here. I greeted her and I've already told her that I want her to meet you. 
 [We see Rebecca Logan is a distance away from them and is talking to someone] 
 Frannie 
Make me proud. 
 [Casey walks over to Rebecca] 
 Casey 
Rebecca, hi! So nice to meet you, I'm Casey Cartwright. 
 [Casey and Rebecca shake hands] 
 Rebecca 
Hi, beautiful house. 
 Casey 
Well, thank you. It was designed by the Irish architect Charles T. McKenzie and was erected in the 19th century colonial style. 
 Rebecca 
I know, I'm a fan of his. 
 Casey 
You have great taste. 
 [Rebecca laughs] 
 Rebecca 
So let's cut to the chase. Tell me about the Zeta Beta's socially. 
 Casey 
We have an awesome time. We co-host mixers with Omega Chi; who are the hottest guys on campus. We have formals, date dashes, unbelievable trips- 
 Rebecca 
-and those don't get too crazy, do they? 
 Casey 
Our reputation on campus is based on our tradition of upholding the graceful qualities of a fine admirable woman. 
 Rebecca 
Good for you. Well it was great meeting you Cassie. 
 [Rebecca walks away from Casey and Casey is left in shock. Casey turns around and sees Frannie who gives her a dirty look] 
 [EXT OMEGA CHI HOUSE] 
 [INT OMEGA CHI HOUSE - There is a mixer happening and the Omega Chi members and freshmen are talking. Calvin and Rusty are standing besides a fish tank] 
 Calvin 
You sitting this one out? 
 Rusty 
I should've sat out this whole night. I had no idea it would be this hard. These guys aren't going to take me seriously. Even these fish are judging me. 
 Calvin 
Maybe you shouldn't take it so seriously. It's a fraternity, it's all about fun, and so have fun. 
 Rusty 
You having fun? Calvin Rosenberg. 
 Calvin 
I'm having a blast. It doesn't matter what I told those other guys; I'm an Omega Chi legacy, I'm stuck here. 
 Rusty 
You're a legacy, so you can't screw up. 
 [Calvin grabs Rusty by the arm and leads him away from the fish tank] 
 Calvin 
Okay, dude relax. You seem like a really nice guy, just be yourself and if that doesn't work, be someone else. No one knows you here; you can be anyone you want. Alright? Hey! 
 [Calvin taps Rusty on the arm] 
 Calvin 
You ready? Let's go, time's running out. 
 [Calvin walks away and Rusty follows after him. They walk together up to Evan who is talking to someone] 
 Calvin 
Hey guys! My name's Calvin Owens, my dad was an Omega Chi class of 85. This is my buddy Rusty Cartwright. 
 [Calvin gestures towards Rusty and Evan becomes interested when he hears Rusty's surname] 
 Calvin 
He was on The OC. 
 Evan 
You're Casey's little brother? 
 Rusty 
Yeah! How do you know? 
 Evan 
I'm her boyfriend, I'm Evan. 
 [Evan and Rusty shake hands] 
 Rusty 
I didn't know she had a boyfriend. 
 Evan 
Yeah, I didn't know she had a brother, not til yesterday. You know she also didn't tell me you were rushing. 
 Rusty 
Ah, well she wanted it to be fair. 
 Evan 
Oh yeah. 
 Rusty 
No playing favourites. 
 Evan 
Right, right. Shoot, well that's what this whole process is all about. So tell me Rusty, why are you rushing? 
 Rusty 
To join a fraternity. 
 [Calvin and Evan both laugh] 
 Rusty 
Well, I don't know if you're aware of the following statistic but 2% of the American population was in a fraternity. It's not a lot of people but that 2% represents some of the most influential men in this country. 43 CEOs of the top 50 US companies are Greek and all but 3 of the US presidents since 1825 were in fraternities. I mean prestige aside; I like the idea of having a group of friends who share a sense of tradition fostered by an institution that's over 2 centuries old. Brothers for life! Right? 
 [Calvin and Rusty both nervously wait for Evan's response] 
 Evan 
That is the best answer I've heard all night. 
 [Calvin and Rusty both smile] 
 Tour Guide 
Right everyone, time's up. One house to go. 
 [Calvin and Rusty turn to walk away but Evan stops them by pulling back Rusty's arm] 
 Evan 
Hey, Rusty y'know when you guys are done you should swing back by. We'll be hanging out, just nothing too fancy having some beers, maybe some girls for you single gents wink wink nudge nudge. But seriously you should come by. 
 Rusty 
Wow! Cool! Thanks Evan! 
 [Rusty and Evan shake hands] 
 Evan 
No problem. 
 [Rusty and Calvin turn and walk away with the rest of the freshmen] 
 [EXT KAPPA TAU HOUSE - The tour guide leads the freshmen over the Kappa Tau lawn and up the stairs to the front door] 
 Tour Guide 
Okay, here you go guys. Good luck! Well, I'll see you later. 
 [The tour guide pushes through the group and runs away from the house. The freshmen look confused at this and they open the front door. 
 [INT KAPPA TAU HOUSE - On the stairs there is a sign saying "Really Boring Road Ahead. The freshmen are standing near the bottom of the stairs and at the top of the stairs stands Wade] 
 Wade 
I'm Wade Matthews, Rush chair. 
 [Wade drops a large knife and it lands in front of the freshmen] 
 Wade 
Oops. 
 [The freshmen group look terrified and Wade starts walking down the stairs towards them] 
 Wade 
So, who here has heard about us and knows our reputation? If you have, please raise your hand. 
 [All the freshmen bar Rusty, Calvin and 1 other person raise their hand] 
 Wade 
Wonderful! Now everyone with their hand up, get out! 
 [Wade points to the direction of the door and the freshmen look amongst themselves and are very confused] 
 Wade 
Now! 
 [The freshmen leave and Rusty, Calvin and the other freshman are left alone with Wade] 
 Wade 
Alright, you three come with me. 
 [Wade turns to show them the way in and the other freshman runs away to leave the house] 
 Wade 
Come on. 
 [Rusty and Calvin follow Wade through the door] 
 Wade 
All clear! 
 [EXT KAPPA TAU HOUSE - GARDEN - The light comes on and we see that there is a large party going on. Rusty has to try and adjust his eyes to the bright light] 
 Rusty 
Holy crap! 
 [Wade puts his arms around Calvin and Rusty's shoulders] 
 Wade 
We prefer virgins, welcome to Kappa Tau. 
 [Wade takes his arms off Calvin and Rusty and he walks into the party. We see that there is a large amount of alcohol at the party and there is a guy running naked] 
 Calvin 
I'm gonna go grab a drink. 
 [Calvin walks into the party leaving Rusty by the door. There are girls dancing and couples kissing in the party. Cappie is walking up behind Rusty and wraps his arm around Rusty. He leads Rusty into the party.] 
 Cappie 
I'm Cappie, president of Kappa Tau Gamma. Sorry for the secrecy but the panoramic ass clowns don't allow this kind of fiesta during rush. So we keep it on the dl. Name? Home State? 
 Rusty 
I'm Rusty Cartwright from Illinois. 
 Cappie 
Really? Do you know Casey Cartwright? 
 Rusty 
Yeah, she's my sister. 
 Cappie 
I didn't know she had a brother. 
 Rusty 
Does she not tell anyone about me? How do you know her? 
 Cappie 
In the biblical sense. 
 Rusty 
Oh, from church. 
 [Cappie looks lost but nods his head anyway. Beaver approaches them from behind] 
 Beaver 
Hey there! 
 [Beaver hands Rusty a drink and a bong] 
 Cappie 
Hey! I know this guy. Rusty this is The Beaver. 
 Rusty 
Like the TV show? 
 [Beaver turns and walks away. Cappie laughs and hugs Rusty] 
 Cappie 
The TV show. Who sent you? What are you a narc? Come on, there's someone I'd like you to meet. 
 [Cappie leads Rusty over to a table. Lisa is lying on the table and her stomach is exposed. They are surrounded by a large crowd of people] 
 Cappie 
Hot girl. Rusty. Rusty. Hot girl. 
 [Lisa gives a small wave to Rusty] 
 Cappie 
Okay, it's really easy. Salt, shot, lime. 
 Rusty 
SSL. 
 Cappie 
Yeah, whatever you need little man. First we sprinkle a little salt onto her tightly toned tummy. 
 [Cappie grabs a salt shaker and sprinkles some salt onto Lisa's stomach. Rusty looks petrified] 
 Cappie 
You take the shot in this hand. 
 [Cappie places a shot glass of tequila into Rusty's right hand] 
 Cappie 
And place the lime into her mouth. 
 [Cappie hands Rusty a wedge of lime] 
 Rusty 
I can do this! 
[Lisa smiles and Rusty places the lime into her mouth] 
 Rusty 
Sorry. 
 [Rusty licks the salt off her stomach and downs the shot of tequila. Rusty leans to take the lime out of Lisa's mouth but instead accidentally spits the shot of tequila all over her face. The party erupts into cheers and laughter. Lisa is upset and drenched; she takes the lime out of her mouth] 
 Rusty 
I am so sorry. 
 [Lisa's boyfriend marches up to Rusty] 
 Boyfriend 
What the hell did you do to my girlfriend? 
 Rusty 
I've never had tequila before. 
 [Cappie restrains Lisa's boyfriend who is really angry] 
 Cappie 
Calm down! Calm down! It was an accident; he didn't mean to do it. 
 Boyfriend 
He spit on my girlfriend's face! 
 Rusty 
But licking salt off her stomach is acceptable! 
 [Lisa's boyfriend grabs Rusty by the collar and raises his fist] 
 Boyfriend 
I'm gonna kick your ass! 
 [Beaver picks up Lisa's boyfriend and throws him over a fence. The whole crowd start cheering and Rusty looks at his watch] 
 Rusty 
I've gotta go! 
 Cappie 
Listen, the bad man won't hurt you now. 
 Rusty 
No, no I'm late. It was great meeting you Cappie. 
 [Cappie and Rusty shake hands. Rusty turns to Lisa who is still lying on the table] 
Rusty 
It was nice meeting you to. 
 [Rusty turns and walks away from the party] 
 Cappie 
I like him! 
 [Cappie turns to Wade who is holding a salt shaker] 
 Cappie 
Salt me. 
 [Wade shakes some salt onto Lisa's stomach and Cappie leans down to lick it] 
 [EXT OMEGA CHI HOUSE] 
 [INT OMEGA CHI HOUSE - Rusty enters the house and the area is deserted apart from a couple who are lying on a chair and making out. Rusty looks around and then walks over to the couple] 
 Rusty 
Excuse me. I'm looking for Evan. 
 [The couple don't answer him and the girl signals with her hand for Rusty to go away] 
 Rusty 
Sorry 
 [Rusty walks away from the couple and walks up the stairs.  He reaches the top and starts looking around] 
 Rusty 
Evan? 
 [Rusty walks to the end of the corridor and reaches Evan's room. The door is open and Rusty can see Evan and Rebecca making out. Rebecca is sitting on a table and Evan is unbuttoning her shirt. Rusty looks shocked and Evan takes his shirt off. Evan looks to his right and sees that Rusty has seen them. Evan looks shocked and Rebecca now notices Rusty too. Rusty starts to shuffle away from the door and Rebecca slams it shut] 
 [INT RUSTY AND DALE'S ROOM - Rusty is lying awake in bed with a serious expression on his face. There is a knock on the door and it awakens Dale] 
 Dale 
Don't 
 [Dale gets out of bed and puts on his glasses. He walks over to the door and opens it to find Evan] 
Dale 
Yes? 
 Evan 
Ah, I'm looking for Rusty. 
 Dale 
It's a little early for visitors. What, you one of his frat bros? 
 [Dale steps closer to Evan and Evan leans over Dale in an intimidating way. Evan spots Rusty who is still lying in bed] 
 Evan 
Rusty, I'm gonna wait outside. 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES - Evan and Rusty are walking] 
 Evan 
Look, I'd like to personally apologise for last night and my actions were... well they were simply inexcusable. I'd never do anything to hurt Casey. 
 Rusty 
I don't know you all that well Evan but I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt. 
 Evan 
That means a lot, I knew were the type of guy I wanted in my corner and that is why I'm going to over you a bid to join the Omega Chi's. 
 Rusty 
Really? 
 Evan 
Yeah. 
 [Rusty starts smiling and laughing] 
 Rusty 
You serious? 
 Evan 
Absolutely! You're a smart guy, y'know we'd be lucky to have you. 
 Rusty 
Well, thanks Evan. 
 Evan 
No problem. So I can trust that what happened last night is just between us brothers? 
 Rusty 
You're not gonna tell Casey. 
 Evan 
Look, I made a horrible mistake okay but it was one transgression and it's not gonna happen again. So, I don't know why Casey would need to know. Like take that speech last night, 43 CEOs, all those presidents and we're all fallible 
Rusty 
But she's my sister. 
 Evan 
We could be your brothers. Alright, well consider this a test of loyalty. 
 Rusty 
You're asking me to lie. 
 Evan 
I'm asking you not to tell her. Come on, don't be such a boy scout. It's time to man up, you wanted to join a fraternity and this is what it's all about. Brothers stick together... for life. 
 [Evan walks away leaving Rusty alone to think about what he said] 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES] 
 [INT GIRL'S BATHROOM - Rebecca is standing in front of a mirror fixing her hair. She sees two girls whispering about her] 
 Girl 
That's Rebecca Logan! 
 [Rebecca looks at the girls and they wave at her. The two girls leave the bathroom and Rebecca smiles. She walks past a cubicle and is pulled into it by Casey, she screams and Casey closes the cubicle door] 
 Casey 
Rebecca, do you remember me? 
 Rebecca 
The architecture freak? 
 [Casey nods her head] 
 Rebecca 
Cassie? 
 Casey 
Casey. 
 [Rebecca sighs and tries to exit the cubicle, Casey stops her] 
 Rebecca 
Isn't it against the rules for you to talk to me and hold me captive in public restrooms during rush and stuff? 
 Casey 
Shhh! And yes, that's why this conversation is off the record. I'm aware that you have your pick of any sorority on campus but no one wants you more than Zeta Beta. You could join another sorority and be their star but at Zeta Beta you'll be with the best, have the best parties, the hottest guys and I'm willing to give you not only a bid right now but a bonus offer you can't refuse. 
 Rebecca 
What are you offering? 
 Casey 
Anything, you name it it's yours. 
 Rebecca 
I want my own room. 
 Casey 
Done. 
 Rebecca 
Family vacation homes? 
 Casey 
We girls share everything. 
 Rebecca 
I'm in. 
 [EXT CYPRUS RHODES] 
 [INT RUSTY AND DALE'S ROOM - Rusty and Calvin are sitting on a bed] 
 Calvin 
You gonna tell your sister. 
 Rusty 
I have to. Don't I? 
 [Calvin shakes his head to say no] 
 Calvin 
If you do you can kiss Omega Chi goodbye. 
 Rusty 
What choice do I have? 
 [We see Dale is sitting at his desk on the opposite side of the room. He is wearing headphones] 
 Dale 
You could forget about this whole ridiculous fraternity thing. 
 Calvin 
I'm sure your sister is a lovely person but it doesn't sound like you two are that close anyway. You said so yourself that she wouldn't help you with rush. 
 Dale 
Rusty? 
 Rusty 
Yeah Dale? 
 [Dale takes off his headphones] 
Dale 
I know that I may seem like just a Christian hick with a very bright future ahead of him, but can I give you some advice? 
 Rusty 
Sure. 
 [Dale turns around in his chair to face Rusty and Calvin] 
 Dale 
These guys, you've known them for a couple of hours but she's been your sister for 18 years. She's always going to be your sister. Now, I know that you came here to have fun and join a fraternity and sin in the eyes of God but you could be missing out on having a relationship with her. 
 [Rusty looks between both Dale and Calvin] 
 
 
 
 [EXT ZBZ HOUSE - Casey is walking up the front lawn and towards the house. She reaches the house and finds Rusty outside and leaning against a pillar] 
 Casey 
At least you're not wondering into the house. That's an improvement! 
 Rusty 
I need to talk to you. 
 Casey 
If this is about brunch, I'm still working on scheduling. 
 Rusty 
It's not about brunch. This is about you listening to me for two minutes, can we do that? 
 Casey 
Did you go through rush? 
 Rusty 
Casey! 
 Casey 
What is it? 
 Rusty 
I was at the Omega Chi house last night and I saw Ev- 
 Casey 
-Wait, I don't know if I wanna hear this. 
 Rusty 
With another girl. 
 Casey 
Rusty! 
 Rusty 
He was in a private room and they were kissing and you know... they were gonna have s*x. 
[Casey looks upset and shakes her head] 
 Casey 
You misinterpreted. 
 Rusty 
I didn't. 
 Casey 
Then you're lying. 
 Rusty 
Case, have I ever lied to you? 
 [Casey can't look at him and is on the verge of tears] 
 Rusty 
Are you okay? 
 Casey 
Umm... no. I gotta go. 
 [Casey moves to walk away from him and into the house. Rusty stops her] 
 Rusty 
Wait, wait. Casey talk to me. Is there anything that I can do? 
 Casey 
Okay, I don't need your help. Rusty, just go away. 
 [Casey walks away from him and into the house. Rusty looks upset and watches her leave] 
 Rusty 
I'm sorry. 
 [INT ZBZ HOUSE - CASEY AND ASHLEIGH'S ROOM - Casey is sitting alone on a chair, she is crying and holding a pillow. Frannie walks into the room] 
 Frannie 
You Okay? 
 Casey 
It's nothing. 
 [Frannie walks over and sits on a bed opposite Casey] 
 Frannie 
Honey, I heard about Evan hooking up with Rebecca Logan. 
 Casey 
Rebecca Logan! She was the girl? That whore! God, she's ugly and I gave her a bid this morning. 
 Frannie 
Did she accept? 
 Casey 
Seriously? 
 Frannie 
Sorry sweetie. Have you talked with Evan yet? 
 Casey 
No, I'm too mad. I don't want him to think that I'm dumping him out of spite. 
 Frannie 
You're breaking up with him? 
 Casey 
He cheated on me with one of our pledges. 
 Frannie 
So she did accept the bid! 
 Casey 
Yes! She accepted the stupid bid! 
 [Frannie sighs and stands up. She moves and sits next to Casey on the chair.] 
 Frannie 
Okay, well all I'm suggesting is you think about this. I hate to say it but he is Evan Chambers, his family owns half the state. You two are on your way to becoming "The Couple" on campus. When I mentioned you being president someday, I can't lie and say that he didn't factor into that. What it comes down to is, how bad do you want it? 
 Casey 
I want it but- 
 Frannie 
-Think of it like this, you'd be giving up everything you worked so hard for because he slept with someone else. That's not fair. 
 Casey 
So what do I do? Just overlook it? Forgive and forget? 
 Frannie 
Listen to me, if you wanna be powerful then you have to learn to not let things like this get in the way of what you want. You do what you need to do to make it right in your mind. That's it. 
 [Frannie stands up and walks out of the room. Casey looks upset and confused] 
 [INT RUSTY AND DALE'S ROOM - Rusty enters the room and finds a letter and a post it note on the floor. He opens the letter and it is branded with the Omega Chi letters. He reads it aloud] 
 Rusty 
Dear Mr. Cartwright, you are cordially invited to attend a bid night party this evening at 8PM at Doblers. Congratulations and welcome to Omega Chi Delta. 
 [Rusty then looks at the post it note and reads it aloud] 
 Rusty 
Rusty, you're a Kappa Tau. Cappie. 
 [Rusty considers both invitations] 
 [EXT LITE N EASY POOL BAR] 
 [INT LITE N EASY POOL BAR - Casey is at a table playing pool. Cappie enters the room and walks up behind her] 
 Cappie 
You up for some competition? 
 [Casey smiles and stops playing. Cappie moves closer to her] 
 Casey 
You know I suck at pool. 
 Cappie 
That's okay; I'll give you a handicap. 
 [Casey turns around and faces Cappie who is now standing next to her] 
 Casey 
Sure, I'll break. 
 [Casey walks around to the opposite side of the table and they start to set up to play] 
 Cappie 
So, what brings you out here tonight? You do remember that I introduced you to this place. 
 Casey 
I'm just taking a night off from Greek life. 
 Cappie 
A night off at my secret place? 
 Casey 
Secret place? You sound like a 12 year old girl. 
 [Cappie laughs and Casey takes a drink of her beer] 
 Cappie 
Let's put some stakes on this, huh? No fun playing when there's nothing on the line, right? If you win, what do you want? 
 [Cappie walks over and stands close to Casey] 
 Casey 
About a hundred bucks. 
 [They both smile and Casey looks him deep in the eyes] 
Casey 
And what do you want? 
 Cappie 
What do you think? 
 Casey 
You tryin' to take advantage of me because I'm a little drunk and a lot bad at this game, aren't you? 
 [Cappie smiles and nods his head to say yes] 
 Cappie 
No. 
 [Casey moves close to him and looks between his eyes flirtatiously. Cappie stops breathing for a moment] 
 Casey 
You're on. 
 [Casey walks away from Cappie and starts to play pool] 
 Cappie 
Okay 
 Casey 
Wait, what's my handicap again? 
 Cappie 
Two balls. 
 [Casey laughs] 
 Casey 
Of course. 
 [Casey breaks the balls and a lot of them go into the pockets. Cappie looks shocked] 
 Cappie 
Whoa! 
 Casey 
I took a class over the summer. 
 [Cappie nods and then picks up the two mentioned balls and puts them into a pocket] 
 Cappie 
So, where's numb nuts? 
 Casey 
Evan's at bid night. 
 Cappie 
Ah, I was talking about Rusty. 
[Casey freezes and then pots another ball into a pocket] 
 Cappie 
How would Evan feel knowing you think his nuts are numb? 
 Casey 
I don't know what Rusty's doing. 
 Cappie 
Don't you think it's a little weird that we dated for over a year and you never mentioned that you had a brother? 
 Casey 
Sibling rivalry I guess. 
 [Casey stops playing pool and stares at Cappie. Cappie moves closer to her] 
 Casey 
Y'know Cap, I hope I didn't hurt you when I ended things. 
 Cappie 
Who said it's over? 
 [They both can't stop looking at each other and Casey looks taken aback by what he's said. They suddenly snap back to reality and Cappie looks at the pool table] 
 Cappie 
Last ball, don't scratch. 
 [Casey purposely misses the last ball, letting Cappie win the bet. She looks at Cappie and they both move closer together] 
 Cappie 
Did you mean to do that? 
 [Casey nods her head to say yes] 
 Casey 
No. 
 [They both stare at each other for a moment and then Casey grabs Cappie by the neck and pulls him in for a kiss. They both start kissing and stroking each other passionately] 
 [EXT DOBLERS] 
 [INT DOBLERS - Evan is at the bar. Rusty walks through the door and sees Calvin. He taps him on the shoulder] 
 Calvin 
Oh hey, Rusty! What's up man? You made it. 
 Rusty 
Yeah, where's Evan? 
[Calvin looks around for a moment and then points to the bar where Evan is seated] 
 Calvin 
By the bar. 
 [Rusty grabs the drink out of Calvin's hand and downs it in one. Rusty angrily marches over to Evan. Calvin looks at Rusty leaving and then look at the now empty glass] 
 Calvin 
Ginger Ale. 
 [We see Rusty has now reached Evan at the bar] 
 Rusty 
Excuse me, Evan. 
 Evan 
Hey, hey. There he is! 
 [Evan smiles and then wraps his arm around Rusty's shoulders] 
 Evan 
Yeah there he is! Congratulations pledge, we're happy to have you. 
 [Evan takes his arm off Rusty] 
 Rusty 
I told her. 
 Evan 
You told who what? 
 Rusty 
I told Casey you cheated on her. 
 [Evan freezes and then lays his head in his hands for a moment] 
 Evan 
When? 
 Rusty 
What difference does it make? I just thought that you should know that and I'm declining you bid. 
 Evan 
Okay you don't decline us, we decline you, alright? You couldn't keep your mouth shut. You had to go be a little bitch about this. 
 Rusty 
She's devastated because of what you did. She's too good for you. 
 [Calvin is now standing behind Rusty. Evan pushes Rusty violently away and then turns back to the bar. Rusty comes up behind Evan and slams him into the bar, smashing a glass in the process. Evan turns back to Rusty] 
 Evan 
That was a mistake, little man. 
 [Evan pauses and then punches Rusty in the face. Rusty falls to the ground and Evan shakes his hand off] 
 Evan 
Okay, nothing to see here folks. Everybody go back to your beers. 
 [Evan turns back to the bar. Rusty picks up a pledge bat from the ground and Evan turns around and looks at him] 
 Evan 
What the hell are you doing? 
 [Rusty looks down at the bat and Evan waits for his response] 
 Rusty 
I'm manning up. 
 [Rusty smacks Evan's face with the bat. Evan falls to the ground and Rusty is restrained by some Omega Chi's. Rusty struggles to free himself and Evan stands up and clutches his nose] 
 Evan 
Get this punk out of here! This is a private party; I want his ass thrown in jail. 
 [The two Omega Chi's drag Rusty out of the bar and Evan turns back to the bar] 
 [INT KAPPA TAU HOUSE - CAPPIE'S ROOM - Casey is waking up in bed, she turns to her left and she's Cappie still asleep. Casey quietly gets out of the bed and puts her bra on. She looks back to see if Cappie is still sleeping. Casey then puts on her top, jeans and boots. She picks up her bag and then picks up a pair of ladies pants that are lying on the floor. Cappie is now awake] 
 Cappie 
Those aren't mine either, in case you were wondering. 
 [Casey drops the pants onto the floor] 
 Casey 
The less information the better. 
 Cappie 
How bout some breakfast?  You make such tasty omelettes, how bout it? Huh? For old times sake. 
 Casey 
Later Cap. 
 Cappie 
Aw, we're not gonna cuddle? 
 Casey 
Last night was a one time thing. 
 Cappie 
Well, it wasn't just one time last night. 
 Casey 
I'm saying it's done. Not to be repeated, in every sense of the word. Understand? Last night was just a fond trip down memory lane. 
 [Casey walks over to the door and then opens it] 
 Cappie 
Fond? Call me! 
 [Casey rolls her eyes and then closes the door behind her. Cappie looks after her longingly. Casey walks down the stairs and ties her hair back. Casey reaches the bottom of the stairs and we see Heath leave a bedroom at the top of the stairs. Calvin follows after him and pulls his shirt on] 
 Heath 
Coast's clear. 
 [They walk along the corridor together] 
 Heath 
Go out that window and there's a lattice you can climb down. 
 They reach a bedroom] 
 Heath 
Listen, this doesn't mean I'm gay. 
 [Calvin pulls on his jacket] 
 Calvin 
I'm not gay, we were just drunk. 
Heath 
Yeah 
 Calvin 
Cool? 
 [They both nod their heads] 
 Calvin 
See ya Keith. 
 Heath 
It's Heath. 
 Calvin 
Right. 
 [Calvin enters the bedroom and Heath walks back along the corridor. We see Casey adjust herself at the bottom of the stairs.  She walks past the lounge and all the Kappa Tau's are sitting there. They start applauding her and Beaver and Wade smile and nod at her] 
 Casey 
We were studying for a project and I fell asleep. 
 [They all start cheering and applauding] 
 Casey 
You guys suck! 
 [The Kappa Tau's all laugh. We see behind through a window behind them that Calvin is jumping down from the lattice onto the ground] 
 [EXT KAPPA TAU HOUSE - Casey walks down the front porch and hold her head in her hands. We see Calvin sneaking behind her and he runs away from the house. Casey doesn't notice him and her phone starts ringing. She looks at her phone and sees that see has 9 missed calls from Rusty] 
 [EXT CAMPUS JAIL - Casey marches out the front steps and Rusty follows behind her] 
 Casey 
What the hell were you thinking? Bar fight with Evan! You're like the size of one of his arms! 
 [They start walking down some stairs] 
 Rusty 
I was defending your honour! 
 Casey 
My honour? That's the lamest thing I've ever heard. Why couldn't you just stay out of it? He's my boyfriend, it's my business. 
 Rusty 
You mean was your boyfriend? 
 [Casey avoids looking at Rusty] 
 Rusty 
You're staying with him? 
 [Casey looks away from Rusty again] 
 Rusty 
You're pathetic! 
 [Rusty marches down the stairs ahead of Casey] 
 Casey 
Don't judge me! 
 [Rusty stops walking and turns around to face Casey] 
 Casey 
Don't you dare judge me! I don't need Jiminy Cricket on my shoulder telling me what I should and shouldn't do. That's why I didn't want you here in the first place. 
 Rusty 
It's simple Case, someone cheats on you and you dump them. 
 Casey 
I appreciate your idealism but you'll learn you left black and white back in high school. Its shades of grey from here on out, doing the right thing isn't always the right thing, especially here. This is my life! 
 Rusty 
Your social life! 
 Casey 
Which is my life! What do you want Rusty? Do you want me to lose everything I've worked so hard for because Evan screwed up? Do you want me to become a social piranha? 
 Rusty 
It's pariah. 
 Casey 
What? I don't know what you're saying. 
 Rusty 
Pariah! Social pariah! Why did you think it was piranha? 
 Casey 
Nobody wants to hang out with a piranha. 
 [They both smile] 
 Casey 
What the hell's a pariah? 
 [They both start laughing] 
 Rusty 
I won't judge you. I just wanna be part of your life. 
 Casey 
Okay. 
 Rusty 
Really? 
 [Casey walks down the stairs towards him] 
 Casey 
Thank you for defending my honour. 
 Rusty 
You're welcome. 
 Casey 
Does your eye hurt? 
 Rusty 
No, do you remember the last person who gave me a black eye? 
 Casey 
Yeah, me. 
 [Casey makes fists and gives Rusty a tiny punch on the arm] 
 [EXT KAPPA TAU HOUSE - The Kappa Tau's are all playing golf on the lawn. Rusty walks up the lawn and meets Cappie who is walking out of the house] 
 Cappie 
Spitter! Fine day for 9 holes, wouldn't you say? 
 [Cappie hands his golf club over to a pledge] 
 Rusty 
Indeed Cappie indeed. 
 Cappie 
What brings you to our fair house? 
 [Cappie turns to the pledge] 
 Cappie 
I think I'm gonna need a putter and a screwdriver from the shut pledge. 
 [Cappie turns his attention back to Rusty] 
 Rusty 
Well, I wanted to talk to you. I know I missed the deadline for bid acceptance but I still wanna join. I wanna be a Kappa Tau. 
 Cappie 
A little too late buddy, we've reached our quota. 
 Cappie 
You were supposed to let us know by last night. 
 [Cappie putts a ball and it goes into the hole] 
 Cappie 
Look at that! 
 Rusty 
But I was in jail. 
 Cappie 
Really? For what? 
 Rusty 
Bar fight. 
 Cappie 
Anyone good. 
 Rusty 
Evan Chambers. 
 Cappie 
Who started it? 
 Rusty 
He did. 
 Cappie 
Who ended it? 
Rusty 
I guess I did. 
 [They both smile and Cappie hands the golf club over to the pledge. Cappie walks over to Rusty] 
 Cappie 
You hit him with one of these? 
 [Cappie lifts up one of Rusty's arms] 
 Rusty 
Pledge bat. 
 [Cappie laughs and turns to the pledge] 
 Cappie 
Would you excuse us pledge? 
 [The pledge walks away] 
 Rusty 
Is that part of the whole hazing thing? Calling him pledge? 
 Cappie 
No, I can't remember his name. So, the only person who can overturn this deadline is the president of the fraternity. 
 Rusty 
But aren't you the president? 
 [Cappie smiles] 
 Cappie 
Why yes I am and I've considered your appeal. The course awaits. 
 [Cappie picks up the golf bag containing the clubs and hands it to Rusty] 
 Cappie 
Let's go pledge. 
 [Rusty smiles and Cappie continues to play golf] 
 [EXT DOBLERS] 
 [INT DOBLERS - We see Cappie talking to a girl with blonde hair. We can't see the girl's face] 
 Cappie 
The thing for me is I don't know how to open up... I hide. 
Rusty 
So is this the extent of hazing? 
 [The camera turns and shows that Cappie isn't talking to a girl but is talking to Rusty who is wearing a blonde wig and a dress] 
 Cappie 
I wasn't just opening up Rusty but to answer your question, no you've got a lot of hell ahead of you. 
 Rusty 
Cappie, I've got my first class tomorrow at 8AM. So I probably- 
 Cappie 
-You registered for an 8AM. You are screwed man! 
 [Casey and Evan walk up to Cappie and Rusty. Casey looks at Rusty's attire] 
 Casey 
Dad would be so proud! Look, Evan and I talked a lot about this and we don't want things to be awkward between us. Now that you're here you're both going to be an important part of my life and I want you both to get along. 
 Cappie 
Well Case, it isn't that Evan and I don't get along it's more the fact that- 
 Evan 
-She isn't talking to you dumbass. 
 [Casey and Cappie both share an intense look.  Rusty and Evan both notice this and Evan looks between both Casey and Cappie.] 
 Rusty 
I think she means me. Right? 
 [Evan clears his voice and steps towards Rusty] 
 Evan 
Rusty, I hope that you and I can grow to be, if nothing else great friends. Truce? 
 [Evan puts out his hand for Rusty to shake. Rusty looks at Casey who nods for him to do it. Rusty shakes hands with Evan] 
 Rusty 
Truce 
 [Evan hugs Rusty and then whispers in his ear] 
 Evan 
I owe you one. 
[Rusty and Evan stop hugging] 
 Cappie 
Well then, let's make it official. 
 [Cappie leans over to the bar and grabs two shot glasses of tequila. He hands one to Evan and one to Rusty] 
 Cappie 
Drink on it, huh? Like men. 
 Rusty 
Thanks Cappie. 
 [Rusty and Evan clink their glasses together. Cappie steps away from Rusty and Evan and stands next to Casey. Evan downs his shot and then Rusty downs his. Rusty then spits the shot over Evan's face and Cappie and Casey start laughing at this]
