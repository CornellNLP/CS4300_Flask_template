 Male narrator : This is Danny. His life changed forever when visited by a time-traveling worm. 
 Are you from the future? 
 [SPITS] You know it! 
 Male narrator : One boy, one worm! These are their adventures. 
 1x03 - "Insta-Beard" 
 Future-Worm, your beard's amazing. 
 Thanks, man. It's bulletproof too. 
 [CLANKING] 
 [WHISTLING] 
 Hey, Dad! 
 Oh, hey, boys! What you up to? 
 Just admiring Future-Worm's amazing beard. 
 [GASPS] Dad! You should totally grow a beard! 
 Totally. 
 [SIGHS] I wish I could, son. More than anything. But I've never been able to grow a beard. Ever. I'll see you boys later. 
 Bummer. 
 We got to get my dad a beard! 
 I know just the thing. But we got to pick it up in the year 5184. 
 
 
 
 Dad : "Insta-Beard"? 
 Yeah, it's from the future. Just spray it on. 
 All righty. 
 I have a beard! 
 Yeah! 
 Yep. 
 Whoa, it's still growing! 
 Uh-oh. 
 Uh, Danny... 
 What's happening? [EVIL LAUGHTER] 
 I'm here to wreak havoc! [LAUGHING] 
 Get off of me, mister! 
 Silence! 
 [MUFFLED CRIES] 
 [BEARD LAUGHING] 
 It's time for... Robo-Carp! 
 Shave that beard off my dad! 
 Activate razor. Shaving, shaving, shaving, shave... 
 [LOUD EXPLOSION] 
 [SIGHS] Weak! 
 Now feel my wrath, you fools! 
 [BEARD LAUGHING MANIACALLY] 
 Dude, this is expired! We got a rotten beard! 
 I've dealt with this kind of thing before! 
 [YELLING] 
 Whoa! 
 We just got to ride it out for a few more seconds! Trust me! 
 Hear that, Dad? Just ride it out! 
 [MUFFLED SPEECH] 
 Cool. 
 Sorry, Dad. 
 Yeah, my bad too on, uh, not, uh, checking that expiration date. 
 Are you kidding, boys? I finally got to feel what it was like to have a beard. Even if it did turn evil, it was all worth it! 
 Cool. Now let's make beard angels! 
 Yeah, dude, this rules. 
 I've never done this before. 
 Look at this one.
