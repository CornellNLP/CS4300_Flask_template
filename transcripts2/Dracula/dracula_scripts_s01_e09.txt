 Previously on "Dracula"... 
 Your man, Hackett, he attacked Mina. 
 Who sent you here? It was Grayson, wasn't it? 
 [Gunshot] 
 I belong to you, and you belong to me. 
 I love you, Mina. 
 You need to leave. 
 Someone should teach her such pain. 
 Jonathan. 
 The Order burned my wife and children. 
 I will have my revenge. 
 The children! 
 [Sobbing] 
 Welcome, Mr. Harker, to the Order of the Dragon. 
 Grayson's technology is a dead end. 
 We need your help. 
 You'd have me play Judas. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, this machine is a threat to public safety. Shut it down. 
 There is another elder vampire in London. 
 He's infested London with creatures, answering his call. 
 Who called you? 
 Dracula. 
 [Screeches] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Growls] 
 [Gasps] 
 If it's a war they want, then it's a war they're gonna get. 
 These arrogant bastards have sealed their own fate. 
 Now, they'll see the violence I can reap. 
 Sir, you insist the Order was behind the attack on Miss Murray, when not a fortnight ago, you concluded that my abduction was the work of a rogue element within their ranks. 
 This is different. 
 No, this is the same. The woman... 
 Janina Kleiberson, a known contractor to the Order. 
 Repeatedly asked me what it was you loved. 
 Then, the triptych... A painting of your wife, yes, but the very image of Mina Murray was stolen and then recovered from Lord Davenport's study. 
 Recovered? When? 
 Tonight. Some agents of mine will be delivering it this very evening, and will you please let me finish? 
 I thought you had. 
 It was Davenport, not the Order, who ordered my attack, stole the triptych, and it was his men who attacked miss Murray. 
 Your point? 
 This was a personal vendetta against you, completely unrelated to his position in the Order of the Dragon. 
 No. This stinks of High Council. 
 Their cowardly tactic of attacking the wives and children of their enemies. 
 Sir, I know... 
 To attack her with acid... 
 To obliterate her beauty, to disfigure her... 
 This is not the act of one man seeking vengeance for his son's death, but a pack of vandals I know all too well. 
 The time for stealth and scheming has passed. 
 From this night and every night until they yield... 
 Blood will flow. 
 Where have you been? I've been looking for you. 
 You're needed at Carfax Manor immediately. 
 I don't think you quite understand the situation, Professor. 
 On the contrary, Mr. Renfield. It is you who does not understand. 
 Put quite simply, your client and I had a contract. 
 I would provide technical skills, he would promote that technology. 
 And together, you and he would destroy your common enemy. 
 Would have, had your client restrained his passion to be human, but he did not, and in the process, he lost possession of the resonator. 
 And now, our plan has failed, and the contract is broken. 
 Now, please, if you will excuse me... 
 He intends to take direct action against the Order. 
 Professor, he's quite beside himself. 
 You really must speak with him. 
 Mr. Renfield. 
 What your client chooses to do is no longer my concern. 
 They're arriving. Every huntsman of note from every chapter house in Europe. 
 Oh, we're going to sweep across London, root out every one of the swine, and butcher them in their lairs. 
 What's wrong? 
 My children have been abducted. 
 Clear the room. Now. 
 Come along. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Door closes] 
 It's linked to all of this. 
 Our men recovered that while they were sanitizing Davenport's house. 
 His son, Daniel, wrote it. It's clearly a suicide note. 
 Daniel and Lord Laurent were lovers? 
 Alexander Grayson is not only a cunning businessman, he is a criminal mastermind, prepared to cheat, blackmail, or murder anyone who stands in his way. 
 But why? Now, why would he abduct your children? 
 How could that possibly further his ends? 
 His ends are not what they seem. 
 This energy scheme of his is merely a means to a very different end, and that is the destruction of this organization. 
 Since he arrived in London, we have been under attack... 
 Individual members, our financial security, and now, my children. 
 But what motive does Grayson have? 
 Grayson has none, but Dracula, that is a different matter entirely. 
 This infestation is merely a distraction, a feinting maneuver that allows him to strike us at will in the guise of Alexander Grayson. 
 Surely you can't still believe that Grayson is a vampire. 
 You've seen him in broad daylight with your own eyes. 
 Perhaps he's found some way to protect himself... 
 Some sorcery. 
 Listen to yourself. 
 This is insanity. 
 [Sighs] Or more importantly, it is off the point. 
 We face a threat of biblical proportions. 
 I'm aware of that, but Grayson... 
 Grayson will be dealt with in due course, but for now, I must demand your full attention on this crisis. 
 But my children... 
 Must I quote the Primary Oath? 
 [Church bell ringing] 
 Jonathan. 
 Mr. Harker...? 
 [Door closes] 
 Lucy? 
 What have you done? 
 [Dramatic music] 
 Season 1, Episode 9 
 "Four Roses" 
 Search the carriage house and any outbuildings or sheds. 
 Lassiter, check the servants' quarters, and send two men up to check on the attic! 
 Right you are, sir. 
 Are you charge here? 
 Yes, I am, and who may you be? 
 R. M. Renfield, esquire. I'm Mr. Grayson's attorney. 
 I presume you have a warrant. 
 Signed by a magistrate. Everything's in order. 
 Hardly. 
 There's no mention of what it is you're searching for. 
 Without it, this is invalid. 
 I demand you remove yourself and your men from these premises immediately. 
 Or what? 
 Or I shall be forced to press charges of criminal trespassing. 
 Sorry. 
 And vandalism. 
 Perhaps I should arrest you for obstructing an investigation. 
 An investigation into what, exactly? 
 They're looking for my children, Mr. Renfield. 
 Be that as it may, sir, they shall have to desist until they return with a properly executed warrant. 
 Nonsense. 
 I've already informed inspector Salinger that his men are free to search this property, if only to speed their investigation. 
 You'll find no children at Carfax, Mr. Browning. 
 Although I've often longed for their laughter... 
 And the pitter-patter of tiny feet. 
 I'm sorry to have wasted your time, but I have my reasons. 
 No, no, nothing to apologize for, sir. 
 As far as I'm concerned, this is just a start. 
 Commissioner's got half the met under my command on this. 
 We will find your children. 
 Thank you, Inspector. My poor wife is beside herself. 
 Yes. Yes, I'm sure she is. Best you look after her. 
 I'll contact you personally if anything comes up. 
 Be it good or bad. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Harker. 
 Shush. Get in, quickly. 
 This is what happens when you're vile. 
 You assume your enemies would sink to similar tactics. 
 Disgusting. 
 You don't suppose Van Helsing... 
 Abducted Browning's children? 
 Doubtful. 
 The man's a martinet, enslaved to his own scheme. 
 He'd rather self-immolate than stray from that rut he calls a path. 
 I wouldn't be so sure about that, sir. 
 He said himself he considered your partnership over. 
 Did he? 
 And when did he tell you this? 
 I thought it prudent to inform him of your plan to directly engage the Order, sir. 
 Really? 
 Did you think it prudent, Renfield? 
 Am I now your charge, and you my caretaker? 
 No, sir, I o... 
 You're quite right, sir. I overstepped my bounds. 
 I assure you, it will not happen again. 
 [Door opens] 
 That was Alastair. 
 I told him you've been feeling unwell. 
 He's worried about you. 
 Hmm? 
 Please, Lucy. 
 You must tell me what's going on. 
 I know I'm not as sophisticated or modern as Jayne Wetherby, but... 
 I'm not a complete fool. 
 Darling... 
 Please tell me. 
 Hmm? 
 [Crying] 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Tell you what? 
 That it's perfectly natural for a woman to fall in love with another woman. 
 To what? 
 For me and Mina to... 
 What are you saying? 
 Oh, my God. 
 That's far enough. Pull over here. 
 [Knocking] 
 Whoa! Whoa. 
 [Horse chuffs] 
 I've decided to accept your offer... 
 Pending your answer to one question. 
 And that is? 
 Why did the Order attack Mina Murray? 
 Attack? Your fiancée? That's ridiculous. 
 We're trying to recruit you, not make an enemy of you. 
 Davenport was behind it. 
 If he was, then I assure you, it was unsanctioned. 
 Had we known about it, he would've been... 
 You  killed him. 
 You are full of surprises, Mr. Harker. 
 Will I be punished? 
 By us? Good God, no. 
 Rogue actions are not tolerated within the ranks, especially when they run counter to our objectives. 
 Besides, I never did much care for Davenport. 
 I trust I've answered your question to your satisfaction. 
 You have. 
 Then, welcome, Mr. Harker... 
 To the Order of the Dragon. 
 The first thing we need you to do, Mr. Harker, is bring us the blueprints of Grayson's resonator. 
 ___ 
 Mr. Harker, I didn't know you were still here. 
 I was just catching up on some correspondence. 
 Will Alexander be needing anything else tonight? 
 I doubt it. 
 He just left, and I suspect he will be quite late. 
 Well, then, I suppose I'll be off as well. 
 Mr. Harker? 
 Yes? 
 If you could, please convey my and Mr. Grayson's warmest regards to Miss Murray. 
 I'll do that. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Renfield tells me that you're under the impression that our partnership has come to an end. 
 I see no alternative. 
 Your inability to control yourself has completely derailed our scheme. 
 Not if I regain possession of the resonator. 
 One demonstration, and the Order Draco will be rendered bankrupt, as planned. 
 Yes, Renfield told me. 
 Another bloodbath. 
 Calling it a strategy does not make it any less a compulsion. 
 Professor, you wouldn't happen to know anything about the disappearance of Browning's two children? 
 What is it to you? 
 Nothing. 
 Only that it places undue scrutiny on our activities by the authorities, and if our plan should fail as a result, I'll hold you solely responsible. 
 And then, Abraham... 
 You're going to have a very, very bad day. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm dining with friends tonight. 
 [Bird screeching] 
 Papa! Papa! Papa! 
 [Screaming] 
 Papa! Papa! 
 [Thud] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Ah, billiards. 
 Grayson, I had no idea you were a member. 
 Rothcroft, isn't it? 
 I do hope you'll pardon the interruption. 
 Relatives of mine from the continent. 
 I invited them to London with the promise that the cuisine here is... 
 Excellent. 
 [Men murmuring] 
 Aren't you American? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Bon appétit,  boys. 
 [Hisses] 
 [Shudders] 
 [Hisses] 
 [Growls] 
 [All screaming] 
 Sleep. 
 They're from you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes. 
 I thought... I thought Jonathan... 
 No. 
 You were there. 
 Where? 
 You stopped those men. 
 Don't think about it, ever. 
 None of those men will ever touch you again. 
 I know. 
 Whatever you think happened didn't happen. 
 I wasn't there. 
 I was at Carfax. 
 No. 
 No, you were there. 
 I have to go. 
 Please... please, will you stay a little longer? 
 I can't. 
 You don't know how much I want to, but... I can't. 
 Why? 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 
 
 
 I believe they call this a declaration of war. 
 It's astonishing. 
 No effort to conceal the bodies whatsoever. 
 Nor the cause. It's bold, brazen, flamboyant. 
 I've never seen its like. 
 And these men? 
 Known associates from the Yard. 
 This evening's edition will report how these five gentlemen were part of a tragic yachting mishap... 
 Lost at sea. 
 Only the Fell One would dare to orchestrate a slaughter like this. 
 Mr. Browning. 
 Inspector? 
 Yes, sir. 
 It seems I've wasted your time. 
 I've just had word from my wife's sister that my children are with her. 
 An errant telegram, a terrible mix-up. 
 They're safe then? 
 Safe and sound. 
 I can't tell you how embarrassed I am. 
 No, no. Say no more, sir. 
 Better to be safe than sorry. 
 Yes. 
 Now, if you don't mind, I'd like a quiet word with my colleagues. 
 Of course, sir. All right, men. 
 Mr. Browning, this is Kaha Ruma. 
 He's descended from Maori warriors, one of our leading huntsmen. 
 Your reputation precedes you, sir. 
 Pleasure. 
 I've summoned the Sicilian. 
 Loiza Scaverra? 
 You'll need a good seer. He's the best. 
 Cardinal Valachi from the Vatican chapter's also agreed to lend us the  Sanguinem Sanctorum . 
 A most sacred relic. 
 Um... 
 Mr. Browning, your children, sir? 
 Still missing, but we can't have the police bungling about, and God help us if the press get a hold of it. 
 You were right to question my judgment about Grayson. 
 I was distraught. 
 That said, he's still a threat to us. 
 It's no doubt, sir. 
 Therefore, while you deal with this infestation, I shall deal with him. 
 In the meantime, if there's anything you need, anything at all, I am at your service. 
 Above all, this must be contained, no matter what the personal cost to any of us. 
 Lucy... 
 Oh, God. 
 What have they done to you? 
 How could they? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm still so confused. 
 Oh, Mina. 
 Lucy. 
 Yes? 
 You're sitting on my hand. 
 Oh, God, sorry. 
 [Laughter] 
 I'm such an oaf. 
 They're beautiful. 
 I positively decimated the garden. 
 [Laughs] 
 Mother will have a fit. 
 Mina, I'm so sorry. 
 It's just you're so smart and kind. 
 I can't imagine anybody would ever want to hurt you. [Sighs] 
 Breaks my heart that there are people in the world who would... 
 Who would what? 
 Deliberately... 
 They're beautiful. 
 Jonathan? 
 No, no. I-I haven't seen him since... 
 Has something happened to him? 
 No. 
 No, I mean, not that I know of. 
 Lucy, tell me the truth. 
 You must forget about Jonathan. 
 What? 
 Please don't ask me any questions. 
 You just have to know he's not the man you think he is. 
 You must call off the engagement. 
 But that's... that's insane. I-I can't... I can't do that. 
 You must. 
 Why? 
 What has he done? 
 He... 
 I can't. 
 Lucy... 
 Don't be ridiculous. Just tell me. 
 You're going to hate me. 
 I'm so sorry, Mina. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm so... 
 Don't. 
 No... 
 Get out! 
 Get out, get out! 
 [Gasping] 
 [All chanting in Romanian language] 
 Romanian - "Within a closed circle, a place without escape" 
 Romanian - "Within a closed circle, a place without escape" 
 Romanian - "Within a closed circle, a place without escape" 
 [Chanting ends] 
 Jonathan Harker... 
 Are you prepared to take the Primary Oath of the Order of the Dragon before your brethren and before your God? 
 I am. 
 I swear on my life and the lives of all those I love from this day forward, I will never place my own needs above those of this sacred Order, so help me God. 
 [Whistling] 
 ♪ 
 We slaughtered over half the London Council in a single night. 
 More blood drawn than in 15 years of cowardly scheming. 
 It is but one chapter. 
 There are hundreds more. 
 Perhaps, yes, but I have this one in utter panic. 
 Could you imagine their terror if I decided to attack in broad daylight? 
 Sir, that would be inadvisable. 
 [Chuckles] 
 One of the few advantages we still have over the enemy is that they do not suspect Dracula and Alexander Grayson are one in the same. 
 And if you were to attack by day, we would lose that advantage. 
 Where have you been? 
 Preparing to leave the country, as should we all. 
 [Laughs] 
 That's right. 
 Run, little rabbit, run. 
 I'm sure your wife and children would be very proud. 
 Alexander! Alexander, I have great news. 
 The board of Health ruled in our favor. 
 They've removed the quarantine. 
 [Laughs] 
 Unbelievable. 
 Is it, Abraham? 
 Is it really so surprising that decades of soft living have neutered our enemies? 
 It's clear; they no longer have the stomach for direct confrontation. 
 Is everything in order? 
 Indeed it appears so. 
 And so we shall have our grand demonstration. 
 I hope you'll attend, Abraham, if not to assist, at least to witness our first decisive victory over the... 
 Competition. 
 Yes. 
 Of course. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Why is he so glum? 
 You know, Mr. Kowalski, there are some men in this world that would rather lose everything they have than be proven wrong. 
 Good job. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 I've just received word that the Board of Health... 
 Has allowed the demonstration to move forward? 
 Yes, of course. How fortuitous for Mr. Grayson. 
 You arranged it. 
 Not me, Mr. Harker. God. 
 We are all merely His servants. 
 Besides, if there is no demonstration, there can be no failure. 
 Sir, you should know, Alexander Grayson is a pit bull. 
 If he fails, he'll simply regroup and keep trying until he succeeds. 
 Noted. 
 Thank you, Mr. Harker. 
 Dear Lord, this is quite remarkable. 
 That's all well and good, but our objective is to make certain no one ever attempts this again. 
 We must engineer a debacle so thorough that no one will ever consider geomagnetism as a viable source of energy. 
 Well, like any machine, there are a number of ways to cause it to fail. 
 I am not interested in failure, sir! 
 I want a catastrophe! 
 Doctor! 
 What are you doing here? 
 How did you get in? 
 You gave me a key, or don't you remember? 
 Where have you been? 
 I... 
 For the last two days, where have you been? 
 I... look, I've... I've, um... I've been meaning to... 
 Meaning to what? 
 Stop by? Visit me in hospital? 
 I wanted to wait until you were stronger. 
 Oh... 
 By all means. 
 Because I'm such a delicate little thing. 
 How very thoughtful of you. 
 That's not what I'm saying. 
 Why, Jonathan? 
 Lucy? 
 [Sighs] 
 What... what did she tell you? 
 Everything that I needed to know. 
 Well, I don't suppose she mentioned that she's been throwing herself at me for the past two weeks. 
 You pig. 
 [Sighs] 
 Don't touch me! 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Panting] 
 Um, just... just... 
 Just... just go. Just go. 
 You won't hear from me again. 
 Why? 
 Jonathan, why? 
 You know why. 
 No... 
 I don't. 
 Because you love Grayson. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Grunts] 
 Oy! Mind where you're going. 
 [Laughs] 
 Watch where you're going. 
 Dear, oh, dear. 
 [Grunts] 
 Out of my way. 
 [Screams] 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, steady! 
 [Horses whinny] 
 [Sighs] 
 You. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yes, me. 
 You keep coming back. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I can't help myself. 
 I brought you another. 
 It's beautiful. Thank you. 
 What happened? 
 Uh, I got lost. 
 The doctor says you may have a concussion. 
 Yes. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Did you wander outside? 
 No, I didn't. 
 I left. 
 I hate hospitals. 
 [Laughs] 
 You know, that's gonna be a problem when you become a doctor. 
 [Laughs] 
 Ow. 
 Don't make me laugh. That hurts. 
 I apologize. 
 Oh. 
 [Sighs] 
 Alexander? 
 Mm-hmm? 
 What's happening between us? 
 I don't know. 
 All I can say is... 
 [sighs] 
 Please. 
 Please go on. 
 You remind me of somebody I used to love. 
 Her name was Ilona. 
 I know her. 
 I have dreamed about her since I was a little girl. 
 She looks like me. 
 I saw her tonight. 
 I saw her in a reflection in a puddle, and she reached out to me, as if she was going to... 
 Shh. 
 I'm here. 
 I'm right here. 
 Do you love me? 
 Don't ask me that. 
 Tell me. 
 I can't. 
 I have something that I have to finish, and until I do, I cannot move forward. 
 The resonator. 
 Yes, but that's only the smallest part. 
 I owe that someone that I used to love a terrible debt, and until it's paid in full... 
 I can't. 
 Besides... 
 You love Harker. 
 No, that's finished. 
 Never again. 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 Well, he... he and Lucy... 
 Lucy? 
 How could she? 
 [Sighs] 
 Mina. 
 No, don't. Don't. 
 Can you please go? I-I need to be alone right now. 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 Hello, Lucy. 
 [Gasps] 
 If you insist on behaving like a monster, then I'm going to make you one. 
 [Screams] 
 [Growls] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Screams] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Sighs]
