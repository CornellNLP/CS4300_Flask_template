 Previously on Dracula... 
 General Shaw is innocent. I didn't destroy the man. You did. Jonathan's not here. I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding another partner to dance with. I love you, Mina. Ehm... you need to leave. Someone should teach her such pain. I will teach you how to haunt Jonathan's dreams. I conducted an experiment by adding this substance to human cheek cells, and the dead cells reanimated. [Electricity buzzing] Ladies and gentlemen, this machine is a threat to public safety. The Order burnt my wife and children. You will have your revenge. When we crush them, we both will. With your serum, I can walk in the sun. But it will only allow you four hours in daylight. What would people say? What people? Your hands are trembling. So who do you love most, Alexander Grayson? [Laughs] [Laughs] No! [Screams] [Grunts] [Screams] [Screaming] No! Sir, may I ask a question? If I told you no, would it stop you? Probably not. [Sighs] How long do you intend to sit here? Sir... I allowed a question. That does not mean I wish to answer it. There is folly in this obsession. Folly and threat. If you want the girl, then take her. But if you cannot have her, then walk away. Enough. "Take her, or walk away." If only it was that easy. The first would put Mina in mortal danger. But the second... That would be the end of me. [Sighs] [Door opens] [Footsteps approaching] Father. What are you doing here? I've come to grab you away. I don't work this late and I actually am a physician. I just... I have a few more things that I... Hiding here, avoiding me, avoiding Jonathan. I'm not avoiding anyone. No, no. Let me speak. What is the American to you? I love Jonathan. I have known him my entire life, and... Well, he's like family to me. He will be my husband, and I will be his wife. But, tell me, Mina. But Alexander... He exerts a kind of... Magnetic force. And no matter how hard I try, I can't... [sighs] I sound like a fool. No, not at all. I loved one woman in my life. But my path to your mother was hardly a straight line. [Chuckles] So I did the only possible thing when it comes to happiness. I followed my heart. Blackheath, Bow, Islington, and Chelsea. Four. Tracked and exterminated this last evening. Good God. We can only draw one inescapable conclusion. [Scoffs] How can you deny it? The signs are clear. There is another elder vampire in London. But you said you'd killed the old one. I did. But the plague continues. Where the old one goes, the sons and daughters follow. There is another one. [Ink jar rattles] Then go. Find it and destroy it. Lovely night, ain't it? It is now. First time, by the looks of you. How can you tell? Not to worry... Ladybird'll take care of everything. [Giggles] [People chattering] [Hisses] Oh! Bloody hell! So the rumors are true. A proper huntsman. And a woman, too. It's time to die. Too late. Already dead. [Grunts] [Both grunting] Aah! [Cocks gun] Who called you? Our master. Name. He has many. I'm not a fan of riddles. Name. He will destroy me. Name. The Fell One. Liar. Vlad Țepeș. Vlad the Impaler. Dracula. It cannot be. We swarm to do his bidding. Together, we will make an endless night. Where's his nest? Tell me! I'll tell you everything. [Trigger clicks] [Ominous music] ♪ Season 1, Epsiode 8 "Come to Die" I'm in trouble. What kind of trouble? Swear to me this stays between us. I swear I will tell no one. The story about Shaw was a complete fabrication. What about the evidence? His financial records... Faked. Every shred of it. Why would you do such a thing? I didn't. I didn't. It was Grayson. He engineered the whole thing. So retract it. I can't. Grayson was too clever to get his hands dirty. There must be someone who can corroborate your story. The bookkeeper? She's gone. She's disappeared into thin air. No one's seen her in days. You think Grayson might have... You know... What? Made her disappear? Yes. Do you think you're in danger? Yes, I do. Then here. Take this. You may need it. You've outdone yourself. I never thought you'd be stupid enough to slaughter Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard. I wanted the truth and I got it. Yes, I'm certain you did. He told me the entire plot. They poisoned all those people. It's the Order of the Dragon. It surprises you? It proves our technology had nothing to do with it. It doesn't matter. The Order made it look like it was our resonator. In the public's eye, it is unsafe, deadly. That is all they know and all they will remember. Even if the technology is proven blameless. It's finished. We are ruined. And what do you suggest we do about it? Give up? After all our hard work? No, I'm not giving up. I will have my revenge. You will have your revenge when I... [screams] [Groans] [Gasps] Ready? What were you saying? You were saying we will prove the technology is harmless and continue as planned. Yes. Yes. [Screams] [Inhales] Dracula is a myth. A tale told to frighten children. Have you taken leave of your senses? Be quiet, both of you. You believe me, don't you? He was a man. His name was Vlad Țepeș, Vlad the Impaler. He was a medieval warrior prince renowned for his savagery and ruthlessness. He was master huntsman in his native land, and he served on the High Council of this very organization. This is absurd. It's ridiculous. She's right. There was such a man. The texts concerning him are forbidden to all but the Dragon's heads and their chief huntsmen. He defied the Ordo Draco, was excommunicated by the Church and found guilty of heresy. So grievous was his sin that a sentence of death was considered inadequate. So they employed occult rituals and transformed him into the living demon that we now know as the Fell One, Nosferatu, primo Master vampire, Dracula. Created, not sired, by us. What proof do you have that he's in London? He swatted off my seers like flies. He easily bested Kruger, one of the most formidable huntsmen I've ever had under my command. He's avoided detection. He's infested London with creatures answering his call, and finally, last night, one of them explicitly named him. And I presume it would do the same before the Council. Well, she would. Had she not taken my weapon and blown her own head off. How very convenient. He's right, of course. Your suspicions may be true, but we cannot rely on the word of one of those creatures. Bring us proof. Compelling  proof. It's the only way such a claim can be believed. If Dracula's in London, sir, I will find him. I will end him once and for all. [Footsteps approaching] Jonathan. You agree... That there should be no secrets between us? Yes. It's Grayson. What about him? He lied to my face, in order to destroy the reputation of General Shaw. But Jonathan, you said that... Please, Mina. Just please, listen to me. Grayson blackmailed Lord Laurent, and now Laurent's dead, as is young Davenport, and by his own hand. That's not what the papers said. He will do anything in the pursuit of his grand project. Blackmail, slander... And for all I know, murder. Murder? He's the closest thing to evil I've ever seen. Jonathan... Mina... If this is true... Then why do you continue in his employ? [Sighs] I have my reasons. And good ones. No secrets. Please, just give me time, and I will explain everything to you. But until then... Until then, you stay away from Alexander Grayson. I want to see her, Jenkins, let me in. Lady Jayne is traveling, sir. I know she's here. Let me in. Jenkins, let him in, please. Alexander, how lovely of you to drop by. Thank you, Jenkins, that will be all. If you need me, just call. I will. Excuse me, I don't remember inviting you in. We've never stood on formality, have we? Why are you here, Alexander? You know why. Yes, yes I do. You win. I don't understand. It's over, Alexander. I'll admit it, I have met my match. Is that what you want to hear? You have bested me. Now, please, just go. I'm far too busy to continue playing this game. Game? [Sigh] Oh, please, just stop. I risked my life to protect yours. Yes, you did. And for the life of me, I can't work out why. Your heart clearly belongs to another. When did you know? When you danced with her... At her engagement party. Was it that obvious? To me, glaringly so. Mr. Grayson... It was always Mina, wasn't it, when you were with me? No. You're lying. So, what have you got to tell me? I found some men. Mm-mmm. These men, are they reliable? Mm-mmm, very much so, yes. For a price. Good. Now all you need to do is introduce them to the lady in question. And how soon will I start making these introductions? The sooner the better. Who do I have to kill? May I suggest no one, sir? Perhaps just this once. If the truth won't set the resonator free, perhaps someone's excised heart will. I have the name of a bureaucrat on the Board of Health, who I am assured will be most accommodating for a very modest fee. Fine, bribe the worm. A king's ransom, if you must. But if it doesn't succeed, then we do it my way. Understood. Sorry, um, the butler let me in. Miss Murray, what a pleasant surprise. Renfield. What's wrong? I've spoken with Jonathan. He seemed quite terrified. By what? By you. [Laugh] That's preposterous. Is it? Of course. You know me as long as Jonathan has. Do I terrify you? No... But I don't know you as well. On the contrary, Miss Murray, I would venture that you know me better than anyone else. Forgive me. I sometimes give voice to things that are better left unsaid. No, don't apologize. It's what I like most about you. Americans. Your honesty. I will never lie to you. You have my word. Why was Jonathan so upset? Mina, there are powerful men who wish to stop me, but on occasion, I have to match their ruthlessness, or the future will be lost. Make no mistake, Mina, Harker's proving to be as ruthless as I am. On occasion, more so. No, you're wrong. Am I? Jonathan was right. You infect people. You call it charm, but it's all for your own self-interest. Jonathan and I will not be used up by you. A proper English gentleman must have a proper English waistcoat on his wedding day, but first, one must select the appropriate fabric. I have swatches. Lucy, I'm sure the swatches are very important, but I really can't be late for work, so... I don't care a damn about the swatches... Then why... why are you here, if not for the swatches? You'll think me a fool. [Sighs] Lucy... I came here because I can't get you out of my mind. I keep my feelings close. I always have. So much so, you seem entirely unaware of them. How long have you... when did you... I neither planned nor expected this, and yet, here we are. You and me. [Sighs] Lucy... Whatever this is, it will pass. It must, if only for Mina's sake. Mina, whom we both love. You're right, of course. I only wish I had your strength of character. [Both chuckle] Let's not speak of this again, for Mina's sake. Yes, that is the only course of action, I completely agree. One condition. Of course. A kiss to help me after. No, no, that's... that's impossible. Do not deny me this consolation. It's a small crumb to ease the pain of all that I shall never have. One kiss. A kiss between friends. You're kind. And you're generous. No, no, no, no. I cannot break my promise to Mina. Mina. How happy you both must be. Always together, even when you're working at Carfax Manor, she's always visiting you. What are you talking about? I saw her there yesterday, last week as well. She does make a habit of it. It was you she was visiting, wasn't it? Mina Murray judges me! She scorns me! [Glass shatters] She will not forgive me! I want some blood. No. [Grunts] I can't let you leave Carfax Manor, not like this. [Grunts] Who will stop me? I will. [Roars] I want blood! Renfield, for your own sake. [Grunts] [Both panting] Mina Murray's taken root in you. Her existence only makes your true nature harder to disguise. She makes you hate the one thing you are - Dracula. But without Dracula, you can never defeat the Ordo Draco. [Breathing heavily] What am I supposed to do? Forget her or take her. I told you to stay away from him. Yes, I know, but I was only trying to uncover the truth. I told you the truth. Yes, of course, but I wanted to know... And you take Grayson's word over mine? No. This whole time, I tried not to see it, and it was right in front of me. See what? You and Grayson. How dare you. I went there to protect you, and you assume the worst. And the time before? There was a phonograph, for the dance at the hospital. There's always a reason, isn't there? Yes, a very good reason. Or do you just invent them, so you have an excuse to see him, to flirt with him? No, I would never even... I don't believe you! I don't. For the last time, why must you make this so difficult for yourselves? [Panting] [Spits] [Sighs] [Groaning] Where is he? 
 
 [Gasping] [Gurgling] [Sizzling] It's holy water. Are you thirsty? If you ask, I'll answer. Where is Dracula? I don't know. No one sees him. And they say he lives in the light. That's impossible. It's what I hear. He has no need for the blanket of night. For him, the sun is just another star. Close or far away, it makes no difference. He has bested God. How? What does it matter how? It is. You will fear his wrath by day, by night, and you will never see him coming. [Coughing] [Gurgling] 15 years of meticulous planning, A fortune developing a technology to undermine their petroleum interests, wasted. We still have options. Options? Professor, you really should take a seat and try to calm yourself. Tell me you've made some progress with these bureaucrats? Every contact we've had has ignored our advances. It's as if we've been frozen out from the top down. This man, Browning... Browning? Yes, he seems to exert an iron grip over London's political machine. He's on Mr. Grayson's short list. Definitely High Council. He may even be the Dragon's Head. No! Papa, papa, papa, papa! No! [Speaks native language] Do you know of him? No, I've never heard of this man. ♪ When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch ♪ 
♪ When will that be, say the bells of Stepney ♪ 
♪ I do not know, said the great bells of Bow ♪ 
♪ Here comes a candle to light you to bed ♪ 
♪ And here comes a chopper to chop off your head ♪ [Floorboard creaks] Hello? [Floorboard creaks] What do you want? What are you doing here? Hello, Miss Murray. Quite a lovely night, isn't it? Ah, uh... [grunts] Now, now. Aah! I like a girl with spirit... But only to a point. Now, I'm assuming that you've never seen what sulfuric acid does to a body's face. It eats right through the skin, just like... [Sizzles] Fire through paper. Lips and lids... Burn right off. Turns the nose into nothing but a couple of holes. Watch and learn, gents. Watch and learn. [Screams] [Screaming] [Screaming] Vlad Țepeș. Vlad the Impaler. Dracula. Her injuries are largely superficial. She will be fine, Jonathan. Who could have done this? I don't know. Will she recover? She will survive. Doctor. Mina. Mina. Who did this? Mina. It's important. You must tell us everything. There were three men... And they attacked me and held me on the table. It was so fast. I can't... I can't remember. Who? Who did this? He had a bottle. A bottle of acid. Oh, my God. And a birthmark, a port wine stain on his face. Oh, my God. What is it? The police. Yes...? They must be informed immediately. Jonathan... [Gasping] Harker! What do you want? I want the same thing you do, justice. I don't need your help. No, you don't. The man with the birthmark, his name is Hackett. Hackett's Davenport's man. I must alert the proper authorities. Alert them? Yes. Really? You're gonna tell them Lord Davenport sent his man to attack your fiancée with acid? Yes. He is a well-respected man of wealth and reputation. Police tend to treat men like that lightly. They must know the truth. The truth? It's your word, an ex-journalist, against a peer of the realm. Come on. Who do you think they're going to believe? Well, then I'll ask him myself. Davenport won't lie to me. I don't care how much money he has, I'll make him answer. [Footsteps] [Creaking] Ah, Mr. Harker. Tell me the truth. Sorry, I haven't an earthly idea what you're talking about. Your man, Hackett. He attacked Mina. This was retaliation for General Shaw. How dare you go after an innocent woman? Listen, dear boy, I don't know anything about this. Miss Murray, is she all right? Who sent you here? No one. No. It was Grayson, wasn't it? He put the ideas into your head? Goaded you into confronting me? You're pointing the gun at the wrong man. Can't you see what he's up to? [Panting] Either way, he wins. See? Whether you kill me and go to jail, or I get a gun and kill you as an intruder, he still wins. Wins what? What are you talking about? Think! Who will be left behind to look after Miss Murray? You see, deep down, you know that's true. You've seen them together. You've seen the way they look at one another. He adores her. And she... That's a damn lie! I can prove it to you. Let me show you. Careful, that revolver... it could go off. Then tell me the truth. They've betrayed you. See, recently, I discovered that Grayson has been searching for one particular painting. For 10 years, he's been looking, in every auction and every gallery across Europe. Stop. And then he found it. I know this because I stole it from him. Don't move. You'll see for yourself. His obsession goes far beyond mere paint and canvas. He hires you so that he can get closer to her. He even hosts your engagement party at his own home. Shut up. Please, no... it's true. Listen. Let me show you, and then you'll see. Then you'll understand everything. [Gunshot] Oh, God, no. Davenport, Davenport... [Panting] You there. [Gun clatters] You need help? Best be on your way now. Don't want a roller to find you and take advantage. Cheerio, then. [Pounding on door] Jonathan. What in the world are you...? ♪ Hello. Darling, you must be exhausted. I hope you haven't eaten. The cook's kept dinner warm for you. Thank you, my dear. How was your day? You won't believe it, but I have it on good authority that Lady... [screams] [Sobbing] What in God's Name, Mrs. Gulliver? The children, the children... They're gone, they're gone... Oh, my God... Sir, ma'am, a man took them in. No! [Screams] [Sobbing] You asked me to tell you the truth... Made me promise. I'll tell it to you now. Nothing has been the same since first I saw you. You're a magic beyond my understanding. I know it's impossible, but you are Ilona, come back to me. But you're more than that. You are Mina too. Now, I've tried to keep my feelings close... But I cannot. You make me want more than I could possibly have. You make me want to walk in the sun. I belong to you. And you belong to me. Lord Davenport is dead. [Screaming] Mr. Harker worked out just as you planned.
