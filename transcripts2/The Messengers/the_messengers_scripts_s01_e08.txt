 Joshua : In the beginning, a star fell from heaven and changed us. 
 Made us angels and gave us a new destiny: to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself. 
 We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving. 
 For we are the Messengers. 
 Previously on The Messengers... 
 We need to find and stop the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 
 The First Seal's been broken. 
 I might have gone online and hacked a copy of your birth records. 
 I just thought it might help you figure out where you came from. 
 I know what you did to Charlotte, you b*st*rd. 
 You and this church are finished. 
 Being a Messenger gave me a purpose. 
 Now that's over. 
 What am I gonna do with myself? 
 Vera : Michael. 
 He's alive. 
 I can tell you where to find your son. 
 Vera : Leland! Leland, stop! 
 Don't do this. 
 (sobbing) 
 Erin : No more seals, no more Apocalypse? 
 So it's over then? 
 Rose : I mean, I think so. 
 (gasps) 
 (sighs) 
 Got to love the morning after. 
 Please tell me there's coffee. 
 You need to read this. 
 She left. 
 "To all my dear Messengers: By the time you read this, I'll be well on my way to Seattle to sort things out with my fiancé, Jacob. Your choice to put the welfare of others ahead of your own has saved billions of lives, including yours. Now you must each choose what to do with those lives. Wherever you end up, know that you carry with you all of my love. Rose." 
 That's it? 
 Yep. 
 So we can just go back to our lives now? 
 Maybe I can get my job at the vet clinic in Arizona back. 
 Koa : Koa Lin, American citizen. 
 I like the sound of that. 
 I'm gonna clear my name. 
 I'm gonna put this mess with the Feds behind me. 
 Mind clearing mine while you're at it? 
 Maybe we can all get a fresh start. 
 Assuming that I can figure out where the Devil hid my son. 
 Do you think we're safe from him now? 
 I mean, can he still come after us? 
 Ah, Devil's been here a long time. 
 I doubt he's going anywhere. 
 Well, in that case, I need an aspirin. 
 Anyone else? 
 Yeah, let's get some breakfast going. 
 How is that possible? 
 I mean, if we stopped Leland Schiller, then... 
 I don't know, but the Second Seal has been broken. 
 (siren chirps) 
 Reporter : The carnage is indescribable, Jane. 
 Rescue workers have already recovered the bodies of nearly 200 Nero employees. And it's estimated... 
 Jane : I need to stop you there, Andrea. 
 We just received footage from the building security cameras. 
 The police have positively I.D. the suspect as Leland Schiller, 
 the alleged criminal mastermind behind the anarchist hacker group, ABADDON. 
 Who the hell bailed him out? 
 Who the hell cares? 
 Vera : What are you doing? Turn it back on. 
 Why? It's hopeless, Vera. 
 Schiller broke his seal, and it's only a matter of time before the rest of the Horsemen do it, too. 
 Peter : What if he's right? 
 It's starting to seem like this Apocalypse thing is a done deal. 
 Joshua : Because it is. 
 Take it from the guy who can see the future. 
 The future isn't always certain, and you know that. 
 Look, guys, we have to fight. 
 Raul : We did. You even talked Schiller down. 
 If Rose was here, what do you think she would say to us? 
 But she isn't, Vera. 
 She's out there, living what's left of her life. 
 Guys, you can't just give up like this. Come on, have a little faith. 
 Open your eyes. 
 We can't rewrite the Book of Revelation. 
 Joshua. 
 (door closes) 
 There's still some time to get out. 
 We could find someplace, hunker down before it all falls apart. 
 Erin : I'm sorry, Vera, but I think we should go. 
 Guess I'm out of here, too. 
 Wait. 
 Can I catch a ride? 
 This cannot be happening. 
 ♪ I can't see what I'm supposed to do ♪ 
♪ Says the boy inside of you. ♪ 
 (gasps) 
 (doorbell rings) 
 (knocking) 
 (sighs) 
 You look like crap on toast. 
 Judge not, lest ye be judged. 
 Save it, Bible boy. 
 I still need you. 
 Everyone is splitting up. Raul left with Erin, Peter left with Koa. 
 They're all breaking up right now when we should be sticking together to work this out. 
 I'm done. Vera, I'm done. 
 You're done? 
 That's it? 
 Yeah. 
 Rose is coming back. 
 She texted me; she felt the seal break, too. 
 So what? 
 So what? 
 Joshua, you're our only hope. 
 I'm serious. 
 Have you had any other kind of vision? 
 No. 
 Thank God for that. 
 'Cause if there's one thing I've learned from all of this, it's that prophecy is prophecy, and there's no changing that. 
 You want proof? 
 Turn on the news. 
 The world is two Horsemen away from annihilation. 
 You can't just ignore that. 
 What's your plan, go back to the church and lie for a living? 
 What the hell is your problem? 
 This is important, Joshua. 
 You have a new path, okay? 
 You can't just ignore that. 
 Don't pretend like you give a damn about the world. 
 You just want Michael back. 
 And you, you haven't even told his father that he exists. 
 And you're a piece of work, you know that? 
 Yeah, and you're a junkie. 
 (sighs) 
 (door slams) 
 (sighs) 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Damn it, Vera. 
 Man : Joshua. 
 Jeff Fairburn. I'm an attorney with your father's church. 
 What do you want? 
 The board retained a new firm in the wake of your father's arrest. 
 May I come in? 
 No. 
 Joshua, with Senior in jail, the entire church is in turmoil. 
 No one knows what to do. They need a leader. 
 This is your chance to take back the pulpit and share the word of God. 
 I'm sorry, I'm all preached out. 
 I know your father froze your assets. 
 What if we made it worth your while? 
 I'm talking seven figures. 
 You want a beer? 
 Raul : I'm thinking Alaska. 
 Erin : That's kind of a long way, don't you think? 
 Exactly. 
 We can reinvent ourselves so no one will ever know the difference. 
 Well, I have heard that it's beautiful. 
 Not only that, but when the Apocalypse finally goes down... 
 It'll take a while to reach us. 
 Meantime, at least we can enjoy the view. 
 (chuckles) 
 Okay. 
 Alaska it is. 
 You want to go get Nadia? 
 Amy : She's outside with some lady. 
 (indistinct conversation outside) 
 Gabriela : Well, I don't like any of this. This is not what I left. 
 You're coming to live with me in Tulsa. 
 The day you walked out, you lost the right to tell me what to do. 
 Tell her I'm not going. 
 I can't, Nadia. 
 I asked her to come. 
 You what? 
 You're 17. 
 You should be in high school, hanging with your friends, having fun. 
 This place isn't right for you. You belong in Tulsa with your mom. 
 How many times do I have to tell you?! 
 I can take care of myself! 
 (door slams) 
 Could you possibly have handled this any worse? 
 It's good to see you, too, Gabby. 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) 
 Nadia : Am I getting it? 
 Please tell me I'm getting it. 
 Wait and see. 
 Come here, birthday girl. 
 3.4 gigahertz, 
 4 gigs of sweetness. 
 When I was 15, I wanted high heels. 
 You want a computer. 
 Just tell me one thing. 
 Hmm? 
 The black or the silver? 
 Wait and see. 
 My princess. 
 Epic. 
 Nadia, Abuela brought tres leches. 
 You have to come see it. 
 Okay. 
 No. 
 (mariachi music plays) 
 Stop. Stop. 
 How could you?! 
 Cesar... 
 You slept with my brother. 
 You make me sick. 
 Get out. 
 Get out! 
 And don't ever come back! 
 (cries with gasping) 
 Jeff : You'd have complete control of the church's direction and message, your father's office, plus a new car, company plane and the ranch in Alpine. 
 It can all be yours. 
 This is a lot to take in. 
 I wasn't in your congregation, but I saw your broadcast. 
 They tried to call you crazy when you said you had a vision. 
 But I knew something amazing had happened. 
 And there are others, Joshua, who feel the same way. 
 They want you back. 
 My church? My message? 
 And a fresh start. 
 Just come with me. 
 And we'll make it happen. 
 Thank you for the ride. 
 Figured I owe you for saving my life. 
 I can't believe I'm finally gonna meet her. 
 You sure you're ready? 
 There's no going back from this. 
 There's no going back to the Messengers, either. 
 You saw them. 
 Doing whatever they wanted instead of thinking of each other. 
 I want a real family. 
 You sure you got the right address? 
 It says right here in my birth records. 
 This is the last known residence of Anne Moore. 
 Hey! Don't you understand what "no trespassing" means? 
 Sir, we didn't mean anything. 
 We're just looking for some information on my mom. 
 Well, look around, kid. 
 Trust me, your mom ain't here. 
 I get that, but I've got a birth record... 
 No one's been here for 13 years. 
 Okay... 
 But you keep flapping your gums, and the cops will be happy to stop by. 
 Come on, now, the both of you, let's go. 
 Please, just listen. 
 Her name is Anne Moore. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Are you Annie's boy? 
 Raul : Believe it or not, I was thinking of you when I called her. 
 It was the right thing to do. 
 Sure, it has nothing to do with you two finishing what you started now that my dad's out of the picture. 
 I knew if I didn't call her, you never would. 
 That woman destroyed my life. 
 That woman? 
 That woman loved you more than she loved me. 
 Yes, Nadia, we had an affair. 
 (sniffles) 
 And I won't lie to you... we were in love. 
 But after you came along, she ended it. 
 She stood by your dad. 
 She stood by you. 
 And that's why I called her. 
 Because you are the most important thing in her life. 
 The publicist sent an e-mail blast to the congregation announcing your return. 
 We're expecting an unprecedented turnout tonight. 
 My father ruined my reputation with these people. 
 Your father is no longer at the helm. 
 Now, try not to dwell on what he took from you. 
 Instead, I encourage you to think about what you stand to gain. 
 The firm is drawing up a revised contract as we speak. 
 After today, you'll be the head preacher. 
 Can't really believe it. 
 Thought he'd be here forever, looking over my shoulder. 
 Well, not anymore. 
 The kingdom is yours now, Joshua. 
 All you need to do is step out on that stage and seize it. 
 Come on, it's time to share your vision. 
 Vera, it's okay. 
 I'm here for you. Whatever it is, you can tell me. 
 What's this? 
 It's our son, Leo. 
 I was gonna tell you about it that night, I was so excited, but when you... 
 So his-his name is Michael. 
 I took him with me to a grant proposal. 
 We were in the terminal at the airport here in Houston... 
 Vera, where the hell is my son? 
 He's gone. 
 Been working here 30 years, first 20 as a groundskeeper. 
 Last ten, the state pays me just to drive by once a month to keep the drifters out. 
 Seen a lot of people come through here. 
 Most I don't care to remember. 
 Who was she? 
 Your mom? 
 She's impossible to forget. 
 Local kid from a real religious family. 
 Folks never let her out. 
 She got herself pregnant at 16. 
 Family found out and made her life hell. 
 That's why they sent her here. 
 Because she tried to kill herself. 
 Her family abandoned her here after that. 
 Cut all ties. 
 Her boyfriend, the father, he tried to visit once but wasn't allowed in. 
 Hell, he didn't even know she was pregnant. 
 She was all alone. 
 She was too young to be a mother. 
 But as time went by, she looked forward to having you. 
 Every day, I'd see her standing at this window. 
 Watching me water the yellow lilies in the garden. 
 They were her joy, them and the thought of you. 
 But everything changed the day the baby came. 
 You mean... 
 I was born here? 
 I can't believe you kept this from me. 
 Had you been honest with me about your illness, I was gonna tell you. 
 That is no excuse. 
 I know. 
 You're right, I'm sorry. 
 All right. 
 Tell me everything. 
 We were at the airport. 
 I was paged and looked up at the flight board. 
 It was five seconds. 
 And when I turned back around, Michael was gone. 
 I didn't even hear him cry. 
 Every trace just vanished in the blink of an eye. 
 What about security footage? 
 I've checked it. 
 Every single camera. 
 I have watched the tapes over and over, and the one security camera that could have seen who took him was being repaired that day. 
 
 
 
 Okay. 
 This is Terminal C. 
 Just walk me through it again. 
 Tell me exactly where you were. 
 We were here, in front of these three gates. 
 492 to Toronto. 
 Two kids, both girls. 
 734 to Seattle, a 12-year-old. 
 And Flight 87 to LaGuardia, there were no kids. 
 Okay, fine. 
 But what about... 
 Leo. 
 I've checked it. 
 Every passenger, every gate, every possible theory that is going through your head, I have checked. 
 And there's a piece of paper in all of this... 
 I can prove every one of those theories wrong. 
 Joshua : Can I get an "amen"? 
 It is great to be back, friends. 
 Do you feel that, folks? 
 (affirming) 
 That is God's presence. 
 Yes, it is. Yes, it is. 
 And he is sending out a message to each and every one of y'all right now. 
 Do you hear it?! 
 All : Yeah! 
 Do you hear it?! 
 All : Yeah! 
 (crowd cheering) 
 (whoops) 
 Let me tell you something, friends. 
 I hear it. 
 And you want to know why? 
 Because I am a Messenger! 
 (crowd cheering) 
 Tell them your vision! 
 And the message I've heard is that this... 
 Vera : What's your plan? 
 Go back to the church and lie for a living?! 
 You're a junkie! 
 Is wrong. 
 You won't find God in these pews. 
 (crowd murmuring) 
 Start the music. Start the music! 
 God did not sell you that 40-buck T-shirt in the lobby... and He sure as hell ain't passing the plate! 
 God... is nowhere near this place. 
 You were supposed to share your vision. 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 I didn't know until I was back up there in front of all those people, but I am through living a lie. 
 Joshua, think about what you're throwing away here! This is lunacy! 
 I guess the old man was right. 
 What are you gonna do now? 
 Follow the path. 
 The real one. 
 (grunts) 
 Did you just have a vision? 
 Tell me what it was! What did you see, Joshua?! 
 When you were born, Peter, they let your mother hold you. 
 But only once. 
 (crying) 
 Because of her past, the doctors deemed her unfit. 
 It's time, Annie. 
 No. 
 Please? 
 They took you from her. 
 No, please! No! 
 (crying): Please, no! 
 Please! 
 Please... no! 
 No! 
 Please... 
 I have to know what happened to her. 
 After she lost you... 
 Annie became severely depressed. 
 Totally silent during the day. 
 Catatonic. 
 The lithium calmed her for a while. 
 But eventually I think she finally realized she was never gonna get you back. 
 And then... 
 I found her. 
 "Found her"? 
 Out there. 
 Right over those same lilies she loved. 
 You mentioned her boyfriend. 
 My father. 
 His name isn't on the birth record. 
 Do you know who he was? 
 You sure you want to know? 
 I have to. 
 Raul : Erin? Can you just wait? 
 I'm sure I could sort this all out. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't understand. 
 Yes, you do! 
 Everyone knows that you and Gabriela have... issues that you need to work out. 
 And it's none of my business. 
 But I can't wait. 
 I just need to make sure that Nadia's okay. 
 After that, it's Alaska. 
 Raul, my whole life, people have been making decisions for me. 
 First it was my parents. 
 Then it was Ronnie. 
 And then Rose. 
 Not anymore! 
 Amy and I are moving on. 
 And not tomorrow, not the day after that, but now. 
 Erin? 
 What? 
 I'm gonna come with you. 
 Really? But what about...? 
 Gabriela : Raul? 
 It's Nadia. 
 She's gone. 
 What do you mean "she's gone"? 
 She left! 
 We had another fight and now... 
 I can't find her. 
 Please, Raul. 
 You have to help me. 
 This is family. 
 She's right. 
 Go find Nadia. 
 What about us? 
 We'll always have the Apocalypse. 
 Gabriela : Raul? 
 (car door shuts) 
 Amy, it's time. Let's go. 
 Hey, I wasn't finished! 
 Where's Raul? You said he was coming! 
 Well, he's not anymore. Okay? 
 Amy, come on, I said it's time to go. 
 Berries are in our blood. 
 And growing up on the family farm, 
 we learned the value of quality, 
 hard work and commitment to a perfect product. 
 We're the Plowman Family. 
 And we grow everything straight from the heart. 
 I know how you feel, Leo. 
 Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with some flash in my mind, a new clue. 
 I search after it, but... it always leads me nowhere. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 Kids don't just vanish. 
 Somebody took him. We just have to figure out who. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 I can't even begin to imagine what it's been like searching for Michael alone. 
 One afternoon is bad enough, let alone... seven years. 
 But no more. 
 From now on, I am here to help you. 
 I appreciate the sentiment, I do. 
 I... I just wanted to tell you the truth. 
 I don't need to drag you down a rabbit hole that you didn't ask for, it's okay. 
 Hey, hey. 
 I understand that. 
 But this is our son. 
 I have to be part of the search. 
 (whoops) 
 Go, Brian! Go! Go! 
 (whoops) 
 (crowd cheering) 
 (whoops) 
 Brian, you were amazing. 
 Mom? Scott and Jacob want to play laser tag. 
 Can we go, too? 
 Yeah, sure, honey, just tell them we'll meet them there. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 He's growing up so fast. 
 And you've become quite the mother. 
 You're a natural. 
 For someone who's faking it. 
 Just leave us alone. 
 Now, Kay. You know that's not how this works. 
 Consider this a little reminder of what's at stake. 
 I made that child disappear once. 
 I can do it again. 
 You told my husband you'd give us till tonight. 
 Please. 
 I'm begging you. 
 Don't take my son. 
 This is it. 
 That must be your dad. 
 (indistinct chatter nearby) 
 Peter? 
 I know it's scary, but... the life you want? 
 The life you've never had? 
 You deserve it. 
 All right. 
 Drive. 
 What? 
 We've come all this way. 
 Please, Koa, just go. 
 Man : Oh-oh! 
 Boy : Nice! 
 Man : You make one or not? 
 Peter? 
 I'd give anything to see my dad again. 
 You shouldn't give up this chance. 
 I'm a fugitive, Koa. 
 And that family? 
 They're happy. 
 They're safe. 
 If I got out of this car... and walked into their life? 
 I would bring all my problems with me. 
 I'd... I just c-couldn't do that to them. 
 I learned a lot about myself today. 
 About where I'm from. 
 And where I belong. 
 What do you mean? 
 The family we had? 
 They may not have been perfect. 
 But that doesn't mean we should leave them behind. 
 Gabriela : We have been looking for an hour. 
 I don't understand why she wouldn't respond to our texts. 
 Gabby, she's 17. 
 Still... that's not the way I raised her. 
 I'm sure she's all right. 
 She's just angry at you. 
 I didn't want to leave. 
 Me neither. 
 That's not the way it looked to us. 
 We never saw you again. 
 Because I went undercover. 
 I spent the last five years working in El Jefe's outfit for the DEA. 
 What? 
 It was the only way they'd let Cesar go free. 
 You see, I did that to protect our family. 
 So that Nadia could grow up with a father. 
 I couldn't tell you about it. 
 You sure as hell didn't want me around anymore, anyway. 
 That's not true. 
 I wanted you around more than anyone, Raul. 
 You are Nadia's father. 
 (sighs) 
 You must have at least suspected. 
 What am I supposed to do now? 
 That's up to you. 
 (phone chimes) 
 What? 
 I know where she is. 
 (sniffs) 
 (door opens) 
 Dad's home! We won, Dad, we won! 
 I heard! Mom told me. 
 Oh, I'm so proud of you. 
 Hey, why don't you go get cleaned up, okay? 
 You can tell me all about it. 
 What happened, Jeff? 
 Did the preacher tell you about his visions? 
 Kay, I tried. 
 I-I sobered him up, I brought him to the church... 
 I'm telling you, he was this close to telling me his vision. 
 What do we do now? 
 We leave. 
 What are we gonna tell Brian? 
 Does it matter? 
 Just tell him we're taking him for ice cream. 
 Just get him in the damn car. (doorbell rings) 
 Jeff. 
 Kay. 
 Such a lovely home. May I come in? 
 You can't take him. 
 Please. We both know there's nothing you can do to stop me. 
 We're done. Do you hear me? 
 Please just leave. 
 No. 
 I know for a fact that his real mother would love to have him back. 
 Do you ever wonder how she must have felt the day you took him? 
 Listen to me. We will do anything. 
 The man : That's what you told me seven years ago when I found you crying in the airport. 
 After... what?... 
 Your fourth fertility treatment? 
 I am the only reason you can call yourselves parents. 
 Still... 
 I am willing to let it all slide. 
 There's just something else that needs taking care of. 
 You through freaking out now? 
 When did you start working here? 
 Today. 
 This is great, Nadia. 
 But what about school? 
 I'm finishing online. 
 Couple months, I'll have my GED. 
 College after that. I'm thinking of computer science. 
 Bottom line, I'm not going to Tulsa. 
 I'm staying here. My life is here. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 What if I was here, too? 
 I'm not moving in with you. 
 Gabriela : That's not what I mean. I just want to know you better. 
 Part of growing up is learning to let go of the past, Nadia. 
 But like you said, you're old enough to make your own choices now. 
 Um... 
 I can go on a break. 
 Maybe we could grab a coffee. 
 I would like that. 
 You want to join? 
 You two go ahead. 
 Have a good time. 
 I'm so glad we stopped. 
 I'm starving. 
 Man : Thirty-three! 
 Koa : Two spicy Italians, extra everything, and we should get chips. 
 You want chips? 
 Peter? 
 Woman : Pomegranate. 
 Clears the liver. 
 Detoxifies. 
 I'm sorry... do I know you? 
 No. 
 But I know you. 
 I once had the same gift you do. 
 Every generation, a group of strangers is tested. 
 Tasked with the difficult choice of helping humanity live on. 
 The choice to serve the world or serve yourself. 
 You're a Messenger. 
 I was a little girl, upset I'd been chosen, frightened of the visions I was having. 
 But with the help of the others, I decided to fight. 
 And together we succeeded. 
 We stopped our Horsemen and now you've got to stop yours. 
 The only thing that can stand in your way is you. 
 Mom, I have to go to the bathroom. 
 Now? 
 Now. 
 Jasper said they were her favorites. 
 All right, this town is getting way too small. 
 I saw these two boys in my vision. 
 I've seen them twice today, too. 
 It's definitely a sign. 
 These brothers must be connected to the next Horseman. 
 How can we know for sure? 
 We're here, aren't we? 
 Joshua : Look, we can save humanity or we can abandon it. 
 It's up to us. 
 It's not easy, standing up against evil, but we're not the first ones to do it. 
 There were others. 
 They saw the same doubt, faced the same danger. 
 But they stuck together. 
 And if we do, too, if we follow the signs, if we let go of what we expected and accept what is intended, then sooner or later, just like them, I know we're gonna succeed. 
 Amen. 
 Amy : Together again, just like my drawing. 
 Koa : Wow. 
 Did you make that? 
 Yep. 
 Is this all of us? 
 Amy : Uh-huh. 
 Well, who's that? 
 That's my friend Michael. 
 He likes soccer. 
 Secretary Richards, what a pleasure to... 
 You were saying? 
 Cindy : Leland broke his seal. 
 We work together now. 
 Remember? 
 Then... what are you doing? 
 Your job, apparently. 
 Or had you forgotten that we still need to find Famine? 
 I've got it under control. 
 Do you? 
 Because it looks, to us, like you've sent a fool to find out the preacher's next vision. 
 Cindy : You should be out there eliminating the Messengers. 
 Not playing... 
 The man : You know as well as I do that we need the Messengers to find the next Horseman. 
 Then... once you've all broken your seals... 
 We rule the rubble together. 
 Yeah... about that... 
 Leland, here, and I have been talking, and, well, I know you're used to doing things in a certain way, but it hasn't really panned out very well in the past. 
 Six times, to be exact.

 We're gonna do things a little differently. 
 What are you trying to say? 
 You're obsolete, Old Scratch. 
 We don't need you. 
 You dare think you can cross me? 
 I am.... your god!
