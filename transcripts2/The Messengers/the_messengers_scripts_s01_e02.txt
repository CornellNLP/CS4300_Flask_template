 (boom) 
 (exhales) 
 You experienced things today you don't understand. 
 Nothing is random. 
 Nothing is a coincidence. 
 Everything is happening for a reason. 
 And you have an important part to play. You're gonna kill me, aren't you? Three shots to the chest, right? (gunshots) (crying) (grunting) (shouts) (alarm wailing) Erin : What are you... (grunts) You stay calm, you stay quiet. I just need a ride. And then I'll let you go. He's alive. I can tell you where to find your son. You just need to finish a job for me first. She's already basically dead. Killing her would be a mercy. (steady beeping) The man : Don't stop now, Vera. You're so close. I can't kill this woman. But you must. No. You want her dead, kill her yourself. That's not how this works. How... how-how am I even supposed to be sure that you have my son? (squeak) Are we gonna go on a airplane? (squeaking) (cooing) Now we just need to tire you out so you sleep on the airplane. (chuckles) (squeaking) (zooming sounds) Yeah? (zooming sounds) ♪ I get a strange magic ♪ 
♪ Oh, what a ♪ Cutie pie. ♪ Strange magic ♪ Mama loves you. ♪ Oh, it's a... ♪ (chime) Woman (over speaker) : Vera Buckley, please proceed to the nearest white courtesy phone. Vera Buckley to the white courtesy phone. Who would be calling...? Michael? Michael. Michael! (squeak) You took him, you sick son of a bitch. No. Easy now. I don't have your son. But I know exactly where he is. So you can finish what you started or... as God is my witness, you will never see Michael again. (crying softly) (sniffles) (quietly): Sorry. (inhales sharply) (gasps) (shuddering exhale) (exhales) (distorted):  Ikiwa ja mamatay sen zullen niciodata fumanisa ceteros. I don't understand. You were in a c-coma. How long? S-Seven years. (gasps) You came here to kill me, didn't you? No. He wanted me to. I-I couldn't. I couldn't... And you didn't. That's all that matters, Vera. H-How do you know my name? Do you know who that man is? Look, I need to find my son. We have to go, okay? (alarms beeping) What are you doing? I need to get him out of the car, sweetie. But he doesn't look good. You can't just leave him at a bus stop. Amy, please. He just wants to get to his brother's house. Amy. Mom, please. We should take him to the hospital. Joshua : At 4:10 p.m. today, on live television, I, Joshua Silburn Jr., died. And yet here I am. Why? Joshua sr. : He may be strong in spirit, but my poor son thinks he died. And he's just not right in his mind. And I apologize for his disturbing and... unacceptable conduct. We just pray he gets all the help he desperately needs. (indistinct chatter) (elevator dings) _ Driver :  Hey, kid. Wake up. This is my last stop. End of the road. _ (error beep) Come on. Are you serious? (steady beeping) What's his name? Uh, I don't know, actually. Come on, sweetie. Uh, whoa. What's your name? Why do you need to know? He's been shot. I'm required by law to report all gunshot wounds. Don't go anywhere. Are we in trouble? No, sweetie. We're not. Come on. Let's get out of here, okay? No. Hey, mister, you got to wake up. Amy... You brought me to a hospital? Yeah, you're lucky it isn't a police station. No. No. Oh, my... Mom! (grunts) What the hell did you just do? We have an unidentified gunshot victim... (indistinct police transmission) Come on. You, stop! Wait! Come back here! Joshua : Heavenly Father, please help me. I've lost everything. Is Dad right? Am I out of my mind? Or are these visions real? Please, God. Help me to understand your plan. (clack) You're the woman from my vision. Yes, I am. And you... are the Messengers. We're the what? We're the Angels of the Apocalypse. Guys, a little something that she's neglecting to mention... She just woke up from a seven-year coma. (sighs) No, wait, Peter. Joshua. Raul. Erin. What Vera's telling you is true. But yesterday you all died. And now here you are. Okay, sweetie, you want to play a little game, okay? You mean, I'm not going crazy? Something's really happening here, am I right? God is angry, so he's giving us a test. I am so not down with that. Well, you'd better be, because this is prophecy we're talking about. You mean the Book of Revelation? Different religions call it different things, but God's message is pretty much the same no matter how you slice it. This is the beginning of the end. You need to stop wasting my time. You said you'd give me answers. You tell me where the man is who took my son. That is no man. He is the Devil. Wait. You mean like the Devil devil? You thought it was a meteor, but that was Satan being cast down from Heaven once again. Hi. I'm an atheist. You shouldn't doubt the Devil's presence. He's a wicked son of a bitch. And he will play on every last one of your worst fears and insecurities. You of all people should know that. What is she talking about? It doesn't matter. I'm calling the cops. It's been seven years. Have they helped you find Michael? We're the only hope you have of finding your son. (loud, piercing rhythmic beeping) Oh, my God. Where is she? Code yellow! We've got a missing patient! Erin :  Okay, even if any of this  was remotely legitimate, why us? If people like us can somehow figure out a way to work together, maybe the world deserves to be saved. Saved from what exactly? The Rapture. When God reclaims the faithful and leaves the forsaken behind. But how are we supposed to stop something like that? By using the special gifts he has given all of us. The power to heal, incredible strength, an ability to hear thoughts, and the gift of prophetic vision. Apparently, I'm the only one with the gift of sanity. Your gift will reveal itself when you're ready. Right. That makes perfect sense. What about you? God has given me the gift of understanding. Yeah. Understanding what? (speaking Spanish) What did she say? She understands whatever God wants her to. In every language known to man. Okay, well, understand this. You need medical attention. And you three are crazy if you believe a word that she is saying, and you... I know who you are. You're a Bible-thumper who probably believes everything that she's... (Joshua breathes loudly) What's wrong with him? He's having a seizure. No. He's having a vision. (breathing loudly) (wind howling) Come on! Come on, baby! Come on. Yeah! (indistinct voices of children) (loud, gasping breathing) Tell us what you saw. Nurse : Search every room in this wing and check the chapel. There's no escaping destiny. Rose. It's a miracle. (both laughing) Hi. (laughing) (indistinct chatter) Get in the car, sweetie. Get in. Up front. You sure? Yeah. What if she's right? What if we're supposed to stick together? I mean, I must have healed you for a reason. What the hell am I doing here? (phone ringing) Hey. Please tell me you're in Cabo doing tequila shots. (laughs) I wish. That's not happening. Yeah, well, you picked a good day to skip work, 'cause we're fired. I'm... I'm sorry. What? You heard me. We're locked out of our offices. No more labs, no more analysis, no more nothing. Why? Is this because of the crater? I wish I could tell you, V. But you know what? The guys with guns... They really don't feel like talking. Thanks, guys. Vera : Just tell me this much. Did you get the rock from my house? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. But what are we supposed to do with it now? Don't worry. I'm on my way. (dial tone) Okay. (engine revving, tires squealing) (gasps) I saw your son! (panting) So, why did you have a gun in the first place? (sighs) I'm a federal agent. But I got framed, and now there's all kinds of people looking for me. Sorry I got you caught up in it. It's just par for the course, I guess. It's been a pretty weird couple of days. Yeah, tell me about it. Look, I don't want to be any more trouble, so would you mind just dropping me off at my brother's? Sure. Can I play with your niece? Well, it's been a little while since I've seen her, sunshine. Amy, we're gonna let Raul spend some time with his own family. Okay? (siren blaring) (tires squeaking, engine revving) Oh, my God. What do I do? Just give me my gun and stay cool. (panting) Stay cool. (siren toots) (gun chamber clicks) (car door closes) (garbled radio transmission, birds singing) (high-pitched tone) Erin (echoing) : Oh, my God, we are so screwed. Please don't let Ronnie find us. Amy : I don't want Daddy to hurt Mom anymore. (high-pitched, piercing tone) Cop : This is the bitch from the AMBER Alert. I'm gonna run her in for kidnapping. Both of you, step out of the car slowly. This is the bitch from the AMBER Alert. Erin : Please don't let Ronnie find us. Amy : I don't want Daddy to hurt Mom anymore. (grunting) (gun chamber clicks) Don't move. (engine revving) You realize we just assaulted a police officer? Like you said, it's been a weird couple of days. (sighs) By the way, who's Ronnie? Did you just read my mind? Apparently, I hear thoughts. You mean... every thought? No, only the crappy ones. Well, what kind of gift is that? Kept you out of jail, didn't it? I guess we're both on the run. 
 
 (phone ringing) Hello? Alice : Peter. Thank God you answered. Where are you? You need to come home. I can't. I'm guilty of murder, Alice. No, Peter, listen. I talked to the police, and Sam's friend ID'd you, but I told them I was there when he threatened to kill you. They know that it was just self-defense. All they want to do is talk to you. You can still clear your name, Peter. There's some crazy stuff happening. I think I need to figure it out before I come home. I'm worried about you. Please be careful. I-I will. I promise. Check in with you later, okay? Okay. Bye. We good? (computer trilling, beeping) (trilling) Thanks for your help. You did the right thing. (tires squealing) ♪ Raised up in the country... ♪ Where exactly did you see my son? In my vision. Oh, God. You don't get it. I've had these visions before. I saw Rose, and I found Rose. I'm not just some preacher man off the rails. Forget the gossip. We're talking about the gospel. And God has every reason to be angry at us. School shootings, the financial crisis. Global warming. The world has gone to hell in a handbasket. Are you trying to sound ass-hat crazy right now? The reasons kids get shot in schools is because psychos have guns. You want to talk financial crisis? Look up sub-prime lending. And don't even get me started on global warming. You might not like it, but this has all been predicted. Are you gonna tell me where we're headed or am I just going to drive aimlessly? Got to be around here somewhere. I recognized it from when my church used to do charity work in this neighborhood. Recognized what? That. Hey, stop the truck. If you want to find your son... follow me. So, what, we're just gonna start knocking on random people's doors? It's the house I saw in my vision. No. Look, this is ridiculous. We have to go. This is crazy. Good afternoon, ma'am. You'd better not be from the bank. I told y'all that... No, we're from a charity devoted to helping wounded veterans. I... You know, I'm-I'm sorry, ma'am, I think my friend has the wrong house. No, we don't. Wait, wait. Is this about Ben? He's not home. Is Ben your husband? He was wounded, right? Lost an arm for his country in Afghanistan. Now we can't even make the rent. He's out of work? Not for lack of trying. But it's tough out there. He was supposed to work for Senator Richards... till some lackey boy of hers said he wasn't fit for security detail. I'm sorry to hear that. Ben is a proud warrior. But if you ask me, he shouldn't have to keep fighting here at home. Any idea where he is now? I wish to God I could tell you. It's him, Vera. He's the guy I saw in my vision. I saw him on that porch. I saw him at the race track. I saw him talking to us at the park. And then you know what else I saw? You. With your son in your arms. Why are you doing this to me? 'Cause somehow it's all connected. I think that's what God's trying to tell us. I don't believe in God. I don't believe in angels and I don't believe in the Devil, okay? Do you believe your son is alive? (bell ringing) Announcer : And they're deadlocked at the eighth pole. He's A Slicky has ground in the lead by this journeyman jockey. (crowd cheering) He's A Slicky, it's He's A Slicky in the lead. (whoops) (laughs, whoops) Trifecta, baby. You see that? Lucky you. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey. You're a chess player. How'd you like to double your money? Hmm. This is the place. That's where your brother lives? Yup. I got to make sure he's okay. Thanks a lot. Sure. It's... been interesting. Do you have to go? Afraid so, Sunshine. But maybe I'll see you again sometime. All right. I like him. I know you do, sweetie. You like him, too. Put your seat belt back on. ♪ ♪ _ (door opens in distance) Aah! Nadia? Nadia, wait. I'm your uncle. Your dad's brother, Raul. Raul? Yeah, I remember. Wish I could forget. Aah... I know you don't trust me, but I'm family. Nadia : More like the one who broke up my family. What happened? I was listening to music on my headphones. Dad was watching TV. Then I heard loud noises and I started to come out, but I... heard the screams. And you hid. It's okay. That was like an hour ago. Is Dad... Wait. D... "Blood for blood"? I think they might have taken him. Don't worry, he's gonna be all right, okay? Really? 'Cause it sure doesn't look like it to me. Who the hell took him? That's a long story, but right now I need to get you out of here. Where's your mom? She doesn't live with us anymore. All right, so it's just us. Come on, let's go. I'm not going anywhere with you. That vet has to be around somewhere. I saw him right here. Well, we tried. I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore. Wait, you can't leave. Look, what if Rose is right? If these really are prophetic visions I'm having, there must be a reason we're supposed to find this vet. That woman just woke up from a seven-year coma. And you have completely lost your grip. I'm an idiot for thinking you could actually help me. There's more to the vision... The park, your son, remember? I'm done. Wait, look, you got to believe me, you're supposed to be here. Vera! _ Where can I play chess in a park? Raul : Nadia, listen to me, it's not safe here for you right now. You need to come with me. This is your fault, isn't it? You screw up and then they come after your family? She seems pretty smart. Too bad you're not. We knew you'd come back. Where's my brother? Why don't you come with me and ask El Jefe yourself. All right, you let her go... and I'm gonna come with you. (grunting) Oh! (growling) Now you gonna come with me? _ When my brave son sacrificed his life in the war, I knew I couldn't let his death be in vain. So I committed myself to doing exactly what he and these selfless veterans did, trying to make my state and my country proud of my service. Announcer : Be a true patriot... Reelect Senator Cindy Richards. (police radio chatter) (indistinct conversation) Mind if I ask you an insensitive question? Sure. How exactly did you lose it? Your arm? I was riding shotgun in a Humvee in Kandahar. We drove right over an IED. And boom. That was it. Woke up in a hospital, and my best friend was dead. I bet that's not the kind of thing you get over easily. Well, some days are tougher than others. But, uh, Jimmy... he was the bravest S.O.B. I ever knew. And, uh, he didn't have to be there. Really? Why is that? He was the son of a senator. A senator. Of course. That makes more sense. It's not you. It's what you could lead them to. That's why you're important. What the hell are you talking about? You know, I've been fighting a battle of my own for a very long time. And I've been wounded, too. Oh, really? Take today, for instance. I was this close to... snuffing out a problem, only to be stopped dead in my tracks. But if there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that sometimes you have to shift your strategy. You put your pawns in the right positions. You let them sacrifice themselves. Then you pick your opponents off one by one. You get close. You get in their heads. And if you really want to win... you make them think you're losing. Then, when they least expect it, you go for blood. Checkmate. I guess you should have quit while you were ahead. Damn. What are you gonna tell your wife? (loud panting) Hey, Alan, I swear, I'm on my way back now. Alan : Well, don't bother. What do you mean, don't bother? Remember the crater? Smoking rock, giant hole in the ground? Helicopters, bunch of guys in camo? That crater? Yes, of course. Why? Yeah, well, it's gone. (brakes squeaking) Wait. Alan, Alan, stop. What do you mean, it's gone? I mean gone gone, like government conspiracy gone. Area 51, 18Â½ minutes of Watergate tapes gone. Don't know what I'm gonna do. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wait! Ben : He took everything I had. Everything. Hey! Hey, look out! Wait! Oh, my... My God. (gasps) Oh, my God. (crickets chirping) (rock music plays on radio) (sighs) I'm sorry. Can't hear myself think. So, where did your mom go? Nadia : Wouldn't you like to know? She and Dad split up a couple years ago. Then she moved to Tulsa. What happened? What do you care? It was your fault anyway. Now you're just gonna get Dad killed. Listen, Nadia, I'm not gonna let them hurt your dad. (music playing) (explosive pop, squealing and hissing) Pull over. (motorcycle engine starting) ♪ Way, way down in the city ♪ 
♪  A long, long time ago ♪ 
♪ I found myself at the crossroads ♪ _ ♪ And I was wondering which way should I go ♪ 
♪ I picked up my old guitar... ♪ Joshua : You're not hearing me. In my vision I saw us talking to that vet. And if you'd have stayed with me, and we'd have found him when we were supposed to, we could've stopped him from winding up dead. You don't know that's true. You don't know that it isn't. Look, I get that you believe all of this, but you're a head case televangelist. I'm not crazy. This is different. (sighs) We've all been given a gift. Yeah, well, I haven't been given anything. God has a plan, Vera. Did his plan include someone stealing my son? There's no such thing as destiny. (clicking and whirring) (static) ♪ Strange magic ♪ 
♪ Oh, what a strange magic ♪ 
♪ Oh, what a... ♪ You've got to be kidding me. ♪ Strange magic... ♪ I'll be right back, munchkin. ♪ Got a strange magic ♪ 
♪ Strange magic... ♪ It's no accident you're here. Do you know why? Yes, and I don't think any of us has a choice. We need to find and stop the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Seriously? Horsemen? She's talking about War, Pestilence, Famine and Death. That doesn't sound good. It isn't. But they're regular people, just like we are. Except the Devil is tempting each of them to commit some kind of terrible sin, and once they do, they're no longer human. They've broken a fateful seal. The Seven Seals of the Apocalypse. That sounds even worse. It is. Each of the seals is like a stepping stone on the way to the Rapture. Can we just slow down for a second? I just came in here to get some chicken nuggets with my daughter. Yeah, I've got somebody waiting in the car. I just woke up from a seven-year coma and found out my fiancéÂ stopped visiting after six months, so spare me your sob stories and listen carefully. If those Four Horsemen succeed in breaking their seals, we can all kiss humanity good-bye. There was a one-armed vet in my vision. Then she and I saw him get killed. Could he have been a Horseman? If you found him in time, maybe he could've helped us. A one-armed vet. I saw a guy like that in a campaign ad. Then he must have been a piece of the puzzle. God shows us all signs every day. Between that and Joshua's visions, it's up to the six of us to work together and figure out what they mean. I thought there were seven Angels of the Apocalypse? There's one more to come, but we can't wait. The end is near. We have to stop the Horsemen. Okay, I'm sure you're all lovely people. (chuckles) I've heard enough, and I only believe things I can see. Then you need to look harder. That is really trippy. (indistinct shouting) (panting) You okay? What did you see? Dog tags. Sword. Blood, fire. Sounds like the Horseman of War.
