 Sheila: 199, 200, 201, 202, 203. 
 (Breathing deeply) 
 Hi, Manny! 
 Hi, Therese. 
 Frank...! 
 Wake up! 
 Frank, come on, I have something wonderful to tell you. 
 Hurry, I've had an epiphany! 
 Frank... 
 ...Do you know what this is? 
 Eggplant? 
 Liberation. 
 No, no, no. 
 Rebirth. 
 Not with all the king's vaseline. 
 Freedom! 
 That won't fit. Frank... 
 (Car horn honks) 
 f*ck you, Gallagher. 
 I made it all the way to Manny's produce truck today-- 214 steps. and the organic squash, and I just kept going. 
 Manny's pushing organic now? 
 This is just the start. 
 The scourge of gentrification. 
 Next he'll be Hawking that coffee grown in cat sh1t. 
 Frank, I am shopping, I am part of the economy, I am myself again. 
 Here we go. 
 Today... 
 A grocery truck, tomorrow the world. 
 It's over. Kevin: I always thought agoraphobia was permanent, like autism or aids. 
 She'll be out in the world, she'll go back to work, she'll learn the truth. 
 That you're a raging alcoholic? 
 Who owes money to everyone? 
 Who's had s*x with her daughter? 
 It's not s*x if you can't remember it. 
 Well, then you're a virgin, Frank. 
 (Laughter) 
 Gonna be out on my butt in weeks. 
 Why don't you just live at your real home with your real family? 
 I don't like them and they don't like me. 
 Frank squatted at my place for six months. 
 Finally bought tear gas, smoked him out. Kate: - I gave myself crabs to get him out of my place. 
 Kevin: It wasn't the crabs, it was your empty fridge. 
 (Laughter) Laugh, laugh. 
 If laughing at me is good for your self-worth, laugh on. 
 My gift. 
 (Door opens) 
 Man: Kevin. Yo, Antoine. 
 Hurt me with some rum. 
 Delivering meals on drunk wheels again? 
 Only one delivery left. 
 Go do it and come back. 
 My last delivery is to Dottie Coronis. 
 I can walk there from here. 
 What's wrong with butterface? Don't call her that. 
 I haven't seen her in a while. 
 W-why's she pretending to be sick? 
 She's hiding her face from children till Halloween. 
 God gave her one hell of a rack and legs to die for, though. 
 All: But her face! 
 (Laughter) 
 You're all going to hell. 
 What's wrong with butterface? 
 She had chronic indigestion. 
 From her steady diet of bourbon and dick. 
 She got it checked, discovered she had a bunch of heart attacks. 
 Her heart muscle is toast. 
 Months to live unless she gets a new one. 
 sh1t. 
 All those years of paying into a city pension and no one left to collect.

 Liam, if you want a popsicle, show me your hands. 
 Liam, hands off your package or no treat. 
 Touching it is his treat. 
 I need my own room without Liam. 
 I'm late for work. 
 Carl, quit it. I can't share a room with someone in a constant state of arousal. 
 I'm going to be a woman soon. 
 Fiona: Hey, enough. 
 Frank's been gone for months. 
 You move into Frank's room, Lip takes yours, Ian and Carl share with Liam. 
 Frank will be back. 
 In bed by midnight-- 
 No exceptions. 
 Mandy: Here he comes. You know, you didn't have to come with me. 
 Bad neighborhood. We live in a bad neighborhood. 
 Yeah, but we're related to the bad people in our bad neighborhood. 
 The hell's he doing here? 
 Hey, Mick. 
 He thought I needed protection. 
 Oh, yeah? Trust me, you may think you know my sister, but you don't know my sister until you've fought my sister. 
 She's protecting your ass. You smell like barbecue sauce. 
 Smell like what? Oh, ow! 
 What did dad tell you? Ow! f*ck the police? 
 No titty twisters now that I'm a C cup. Ow. 
 C cup? Bitch, you wish. 
 Hey, f*ck you, f*ck you, and especially f*ck you. 
 All right, Jesus, let's get out of here before they throw you back in. 
 Woman: Who the hell is it? 
 It's Frank Gallagher, Dottie. 
 Get off my property. 
 I brought your pasta primavera. 
 Eat sh1t, Frank. 
 Well, I-I would, but I recently went vegan. 
 (Laughing) 
 (Chuckling) 
 (Coughing) 
 Honestly, Dottie, Antoine told us your news. 
 I've had some health setbacks myself. 
 Wanted to tell you the crew at the bar's thinking of you. 
 Thought I'd bring your dinner over and tell you in person. 
 No lasagna left? 
 I grabbed the last one he had. 
 Enjoying your night? 
 I'm watching one of those fat-people-hate-themselves- for-being-fat shows. 
 Makes me feel healthy. 
 I love that show. 
 I hate fat people. 
 (Car alarm chirps)

 Oh, guy locking his car.

 Okay, either he doesn't have a dick or the dick he does have does not function. 
 Or maybe the five girls a night who give him their number give him more than their number, and the man is just tired. 
 Desperate whore-wife is back with sugar grampy. 
 Can you say that again with some head bobbing and that finger snapping thing? 
 She's a married mother publicly flaunting the geriatric she's sleeping with. 
 He's 50. He looks it. 
 And he's rich, so work that cleavage and smile. 
 Hey, Veronica! 
 Hey, baby. Hi, David. 
 Veronica: Hello, David. 
 Looking sharp. Jazz says I'm springing for Cristal, or I'm going home alone. 
 Oh, we don't want you to be lonely tonight, do we, V? 
 Handsome man like this, no, ma'am. Ah, yes. 
 ♪ I'll make you want a piece of me again and again... ♪ 
 Hot as balls tonight. 
 So, I'm taking geometry, algebra two, trigonometry, chemistry. 
 During the summer? 
 Well, I'm trying to get into West Point. 
 (Laughs): If you want the army to give you a f*cking gun, all you got to do is enlist. 
 Recruiting station's, like, two blocks that way. 
 I want to be an officer. 
 Want to be an officer, huh? 
 Don't officers get shot first? 
 Here. 
 Shotgun. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Sniffles) 
 Oh. 
 (Coughing) 
 So you make a lot of friends on the inside? 
 (Belches) You want to chitchat more, or you want to get on me? 
 Plasma? Led. Shh. 
 Man (On tv): I never feared taking my shirt off at the beach. 
 But then I saw this footage my daughter shot of me... 
 Nice picture. 
 ...And I just broke down. Vibrant. 
 Can I watch my program, please? 
 How did I become so disgusting? 
 And sit in the chair. 
 I don't want you stretching out on the couch and rip van winkling it for the next five years. 
 (Sharp beep) 
 Did you hear a beep? 
 Smoke alarm battery is dying. 
 If they find a heart, they're supposed to beep me on this thing. 
 It means I go straight to the hospital. 
 (Sharp beep) 
 They got to find different sounds for different things. 
 Everything beeps. 
 Smoke alarms, hearing aids, microwaves, cell phones. 
 I'm gonna have a heart attack waiting for my heart transplant. 
 You got a nine-volt battery? 
 I can change that for you. 
 In the junk drawer under the microwave. 
 ...But then I would gorge and binge, yet not purge. 
 I didn't have a disorder. 
 I just had a disgusting habit of eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. 
 (Knocking) 
 Frank? 
 Antoine. 
 I borrowed your keys so I could help. 
 I went to white castle and bought her this. 
 I thought she'd be starving by now. 
 She's not. Thank you.

 Sorry, two mudslides and a line of blow, I get grabby. 
 David's doing a rail in the men's room. You want some? 
 Can't. Can. 
 You got to slow down on the work and enjoy the summer! 
 I'll keep that in mind when I'm feeding my family dog food in January. 
 David's friend Richard's coming to town tomorrow. 
 Meet him! We'll make them take us out on the town. 
 Instead of worrying about making money, we'll be spending theirs. Not into married guys. 
 I never said he was married. Meet him! 
 Before you know it, your sh1t will start sagging, leg veins will pop up, and you won't be able to screw without handfuls of astroglide. 
 I'm 21. It doesn't make you a kept woman. 
 It makes you a smart one. 
 Who wants to move this party back to my pied-à-terre? 
 Me! You! Fiona? 
 Uh, another time. 
 You asked about Richard? 
 She's thinking about it.

 Come on, I need an accomplice.

 You heard about that? 
 I was playing second. 
 (Laughs) (Can opening) 
 f*cking tough guy, huh? 
 Mm. 
 (Grunts) 
 (Siren wailing in distance) 
 (Grunting) 
 (Panting) 
 Not much to do in the joint but work out. 
 You could read. 
 f*ck off. f*cked for life anyway, man. 
 Want to sneak into the Sox game tomorrow? 
 Nah, man. I got to get me a job. 
 If I don't get one in two weeks, my probation skank's gonna do it for me, and I'm gonna end up losing a f*cking limb at the meat packing plant. 
 Maybe she'll find you something better. 
 She ain't gonna find f*ck all. 
 My dad even had to threaten this mook he knows from high school to get me a job tarring roofs. 
 Maybe you could head down to Malcolm X. 
 You know, take some vocational training. 
 Why the f*ck are we talking about community college right now? 
 Jesus Christ, you want us to spread a blanket out and look for shooting stars next? 
 (Laughs) 
 (Burps) 
 I could talk to Linda. 
 I'm sorry. You want me to work at the place I got shot? 
 Redemption tale. 
 What would I be doing? Helping. 
 I ain't cleaning up after people. 
 It's a pretty clean store, Mickey. 
 What about security? 
 You know, scaring people like me who come into the store trying to steal sh1t? 
 Stealing's been down since your shooting. 
 Hey, do whatever you want, man. 
 You brought it up. 
 All right. 
 You ready to go again, or you, uh, need some time, fire crotch? 
 Okay. 
 (Engine starting) 
 (Engine revving) 
 How's Jody? 
 He's good. 
 As good as me? 
 We're still not having s*x. 
 Right, 'cause his name's Jody. 
 (Laughs) 
 Is that a, uh, real name or a nickname? 
 (Sighs) 
 You know, isn't it kind of creepy that a guy who's twice your age keeps hanging around you, but hasn't tried to get in your pants yet? 
 (Moans) 
 You two getting serious? 
 Stop talking about my boyfriend and f*ck me. 
 (Both grunting) 
 Smoke alarm working, fan back up to speed. 
 What now? 
 I could give you some rope to hang yourself from it, or you could just leave. 
 How's your daughter? Same. 
 Any complications from that skin graft? 
 Haven't talked since she moved to Sweden. 
 What the hell's she doing in Sweden? 
 Avoiding me. 
 I'm off to bed. 
 Bed?! It's 11:00! 
 You used to close the Alibi every night. 
 Used to do lots of things. 
 Anything else I can do for you? 
 What's the deal, Frank? 
 What, did Sheila Jackson finally throw you out? 
 Just offering my services. 
 Stocking up on your corporal works of mercy? 
 One friend helping out another. 
 The upstairs bathroom's clogged pretty bad. 
 I could lie and say it was roots growing in the pipes, but it's all me, and a half dozen of those adult wipes. 
 I never used those wipes myself. 
 Thought they were an extravagance. 
 Little did I know how nice it feels to polish things up down there. 
 Let yourself out. 
 There's nothing worth stealing you can carry. 
 Mother of God!

 Oh, sh1t!

 Want to go to a rave up in lake forest this weekend? 
 If I hated myself. 
 Jody knows a guy, Henry Woodhouse, who can send out a tweet and get over a thousand people to show anywhere in less than two hours. 
 It's like a flash mob, but more fun. 
 Excepting the fact that it's in lake forest and lake forest kids are there. 
 You want to do something tomorrow night? 
 Probably watching  Wipeout  with Jody. 
 He loves that show. 
 People running around, wiping out. 
 "Big Balls!" 
 It's hilarious. (Laughs) 
 We make popcorn and laugh. Yeah, it sounds like a crazy summer night. 
 We're keeping each other company trying to avoid familiar patterns. 
 Mm-hmm. And, um...

 (Door squeaks open) 
 Shot of maker's mark, Kate. 
 You and I had a good thing once, didn't we? 
 We did not. 
 I always liked you. 
 You were fun. 
 What happened? 
 I stopped drinking. 
 Why? 
 I kept waking up next to you. 
 Better hit me again. 
 Antoine told us what you did. 
 I brought a hungry, sick friend her dinner. 
 It is amazing how low you're willing to go. 
 Did you lecture Antoine about getting loaded while Dottie starved herself waiting for him? 
 You actually went over there? 
 Feed the hungry, tend to the sick. 
 I'm walking the walk. 
 She's gonna die soon. Wh-what are you after? 
 Her home? Her pension? 
 I may love her. 
 I don't know. 
 (Sighs) 
 Time will tell. 
 "And so the pizza decides to go look for his friends. 
 The end." 
 (Boy chatters) 
 Who wants a bonus story? 
 All: Me! 
 This is called "Fiona's thoughts, sophomore year 2006." 
 "Flirted with Craig Heisner today." 
 His ass looked great in his jeans. 
 I bet he could really pick me up and throw me around. 
 I thought about him doing me the rest of the day. 
 Craig Heisner, Craig Heisner, Craig Heisner. 
 Part of me wishes I saved my virginity "so Craig Heisner could be the one..." 
 Story time's over, kids. 
 Who wants to go outside and blow bubbles? 
 Kids: Me! Okay! 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 You still want to blow Craig Heisner? Where'd you get this? 
 Under the stairs. 
 Why is your mattress down here? 
 Need a place to sleep. 
 You have a place to sleep. 
 Take it back upstairs. 
 And when you find something that isn't yours, keep it that way.

 No. My  pee  bag.

 Not now, anyway.

 How is it that you and I both spent so much time at the Alibi, but we never hooked up?

 If a chick, you know, she's taking it slow with a guy, not sleeping with him, what do you think that means? 
 Means you're not getting laid. 
 All right, Timmy, look, this is your third one. 
 That's it for today, okay? 
 Don't come back unless it's to buy pot. 
 Got to watch out for the chicks that don't sleep with you, man. 
 You know what it means? 
 Means they like you. 
 Like, like you, like you. 
 Like, love you, like you. 
 And they keep, you know, holding back because they're so into you. 
 But they're also waiting for you to finally grasp how awesome they are so when you do end up having s*x for the first time, you're, you know, making love or some sh1t. 
 Oh, and the experience-- 
 It's because, you know, you've been waiting so long for a little action, that when you do have s*x, it's some otherworldly connected thing, which makes you think that you can be in a long haul kind of commitment. 
 Two buds and a spliff, please.

 Hey, Gary. 
 See you tomorrow. Thanks. 
 You had no interest in my showing up tonight, did you? 
 What'd she tell you? 
 Uh, that you, uh, saw a photo and couldn't wait to meet me. 
 I saw no photo. 
 She has no photo. 
 So, why'd you come? 
 Well, my company does about $250 million worth of business with David's company. 
 And he's fond of Jasmine. 
 I didn't want to be the one to upset the concubine. 
 So how much longer do you think we need to keep talking to each other to make it seem like we really gave it a shot? 
 I don't know, two or three more minutes. 
 Tops. 
 You want to see a photo of me now? 
 I'm good. 
 Fully decent. 
 It's me in grade school, after I lost my first tooth. 
 That style is coming back. 
 Did it ever arrive? 
 With the Iroquois. 
 And, uh, punk rock. 
 So, how does this arrangement work? 
 I dress pretty, hang on your arm, we have s*x a couple times a month, then you give me credit cards to buy sh1t that I like but don't need? 
 I have no idea. 
 I'm just here 'cause I was invited. 
 I don't make it a habit of hanging around women that don't have any interest in being with me.

 Well, how does anybody know anything?
