 This is what you missed last week on  Shameless: 
 (spits) 
 Dad's missing. 
 How the hell did I end up in Canada?! 
 STEVE:  Frank needs a wake-up call, before he wrecks all your lives. 
 You left him there? You get him back. 
 You must be joking. 
 You're f*cking  him? 
 Frank. 
 Relax. 
 (Frank screams) 
 Morning. TONY:  The CYO Awards 
 Banquet is next week at St. Stephens. 
 I was hoping you'd come.

 Amazing! Really good! 
 Good, good! Tony? Hmm? 
 Shut up!

 Yeah! Absolutely! 
 Oh, sh1t! Oh!

 Hey, that's sexual harassm... 
 Mandy? 
 Hey, Ian. 
 Uh, what, what's going on? 
 I wanted to thank you for coming to my rescue in history class today. 
 The colonial soldiers conserved what by declaring, "Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes"? 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 (kids laugh) 
 IAN:  No problem. 
 Mr. Bancroft's a prick. 
 Well, I think you might be my knight in shining armor. 
 (laughs) Right. 
 (giggles) 
 You are funny, Ian Gallagher. 
 Okay. 
 Well, what time do you get off work? 
 Uh, you know, I think it's inventory night, so probably not till really late. 
 All right, well, I guess I'll see you around school tomorrow, then? 
 Yeah, right. Uh... See you tomorrow, Mandy. 
 (bell dings) 
 Bye, Ian. 
 MAN: This crocodile here would be just as happy munching on that hunk of chicken as he would dining on our croc tamer's hand. 
 These amazing creatures may look cute and cuddly, but caution should be taken... 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Frank, can you get that? 
 What? The door. 
 (quietly): Oh, Christ. 
 Dad. Son. 
 I'm here for Karen. 
 Oh. 
 Karen, there's a boy here for you. 
 KAREN: Be down in a sec. 
 SHEILA: (gasps) Philip! 
 Hi! 
 I've made chicken Kiev. There's leftovers. 
 Oh, no, that's-that's fine, Sheila. 
 I think Karen and I are just gonna grab some burgers later. 
 I'll take some of those little red potatoes, if you could do it. 
 Of course, sweetie. 
 This your home now? 
 First time in my life I ever felt like I actually belong somewhere. 
 Right. It's quiet, clean, good food. 
 Free. 
 What are your intentions? 
 Excuse me? 
 With Karen. Your intentions? 
 LIP: Hey. 
 Ready? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, let's, uh... let's get out of here. 
 Have her home by midnight! 
 And nothing below the waist!

 Boo! 
 Mandy? 
 You miss me? 
 Yes. 
 Uh... 
 Wha-What are you doing here? 
 Waiting to walk you home, silly. 
 Oh.

 ANNOUNCER: Tropic Thunder is right on Gravedigger's back wheel! 
 He's hooked himself to the Digger's bumper! 
 Look at that...! 
 Do you, um, want another beer? 
 Okay. 
 But-But don't be too long. 
 Ow! 
 Get out of here, shithead! 
 Ow! Fine. Whatever. 
 You're leaving? 
 Yeah. Enjoy getting herpes. 
 (announcer speaking indistinctly) 
 He's been known to come back from worse collisions. 
 I'm thinking of Anaheim, 2003, when Gravedigger got into that scuffle with the Windjammer. 
 (grunts) Mandy! 
 Mandy, maybe we should, uh... 
 Shh. It's okay. 
 I have one. 
 (giggles) 
 Uh, Mandy, okay. 
 Uh, okay. 
 So, what happened with you and that guy, uh... Steve, was it? 
 Those kids, they really love you. 
 They were so cute. 
 "Do the siren, do the siren!" 
 So, I take it you two broke up? 
 What? You came with me to the banquet. 
 IAN: Mandy! 
 (Mandy sobbing) 
 Why is Mandy Milkovich crying? 
 I'll see ya, Tony. 
 Who did what to Mandy Milkovich? 
 (horn blares) 
 What's wrong with your mom? 
 Why can't she ever leave the house? 
 What's wrong with your dad? 
 Why is he such a drunk? 
 (dog barking in distance) 
 Is that a hickey? 
 Nah, I burned myself with a curling iron. 
 This  is a hickey. 
 Who from? 
 Ernie Morrissey. 
 Amateur. 
 What's it like with my dad living at your house? 
 Weird. 
 It's only gonna get weirder. 
 It's cold out here. 
 (chuckles) 
 I think I hear it coming. 
 (chuckles) 
 (train rumbling) 
 (both screaming) 
 (sighs) 
 What the f*ck? 
 What are you doing to her? 
 Clearing the toxins from her lungs. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hey, babe. 
 Stop lending the Gallaghers our sh1t, V. 
 A toaster? Who borrows a toaster? 
 Carl set theirs on fire trying to melt two action figures together. 
 Yeah? I don't give a sh1t if he was trying to melt his balls together. 
 Tell him to buy a toaster. 
 They're like 20 bucks, for Christ sakes. 
 Maybe you should clear the toxins from her ass. 
 You smell her room lately? 
 At least I don't sh1t in a bag. 
 Ten minutes to get downstairs. 
 Why is it so cold in this house? 
 (knocking at door) 
 Looks like an "A" to me. 
 Can someone get the door? 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 The bat is for killing, not for taking to school. 
 I don't need any more notes from your teacher. 
 (knocking continues) 
 Fine, I'll get the door. 
 Go away. 
 I'm here for Ian, not for you, huh? 
 Befriend the brother to win back the girl? 
 Is that what I'm doing? You tell me. 
 Why is it so cold in here? 
 Where's my damn toaster? Huh? 
 Who borrows a toaster? 
 (sizzling) 
 No! Yo, Destructo, that's my toaster! 
 I'm trying to make Melted Man. 
 Yeah, well, use a blowtorch like a normal kid. 
 Hey, Fi, some flower delivery guy was looking for your address. Here. 
 They're from him. 
 Toss 'em. No, they're not. 
 Nope. 
 DEBBIE: Yes! 
 Four bars. Thank you, Beaver327. 
 Back for more abuse. You're like a boomerang. 
 Yeah, no, I-I lost a bet to Ian on the Islanders game. 
 Need to see what tickets he wants me to get him. 
 And we live in the 1700's, where telephones haven't been invented yet, so of course you couldn't just call. 
 Not when I knew you were dying to see me. 
 (stove clicking) 
 sh1t. 
 Yo. Got my tickets? Yeah, what game? 
 Philly on the 12th or Edmonton on the 27th? 
 Uh, the Oilers, yeah, definitely. 
 That's a good choice. The Flyers are a bunch of fags. 
 FIONA: Goddamn it. The gas bill's late. 
 No wonder it's freezing in here. 
 "Fiona, thanks for a night I'll never forget. 
 Tony." 
 Give me that. 
 Who the f*ck's Tony? 
 You hooked up with Tony? 
 How charitable of you. 
 Wait, Tony the cop? That Tony? 
 Yeah. Really? 
 Yeah, and we had a nice time, okay? 
 Tony's sweet. And he has a real job. 
 (snoring) 
 I'm sorry, I totally fell asleep when you were talking about him. 
 How long was I out for? FIONA: Lip, phone. 
 And what exactly does "hooked up" mean? 
 Last time I checked, pen1s goes into v*g1n*. 
 Wow! 
 No, okay. We're going to have oatmeal this morning. 
 Go get the hot plate. 
 Jesus, you sure didn't waste any time, did you? 
 Here you go, sweetie. 
 Thank you. You're welcome. 
 And I am off to the store. 
 Does anyone need anything? 
 The store? 
 I thought you ne... 
 (loud kick) 
 Ow! Christ in a basket! 
 I have a feeling that today's going to be the day, Mom. 
 I think so, too, sweetie. I think so, too. Ah. 
 All right, well, get me a case of Old Style tall boys, will ya? 
 Okay. 
 (muttering): Old Style tall boys... 
 Tall boys. 
 Okay, so, I'm off. 
 Okay, just one foot in front of the other. 
 And I will open the door. 
 Open the door, and I take a step out... 
 (traffic passing) 
 (truck horn blaring) 
 (traffic grows louder) 
 (car horn honking) 
 (people yelling) 
 (traffic roaring) 
 (loud jackhammering) 
 (Sheila screaming) 
 Mom! 
 Mom. Okay... 
 I've got you, Mom. 
 I'm right here. 
 (sobbing) 
 Okay. 
 (Sheila sniffles) 
 KAREN: You're right here. You're in your house. 
 (murmurs) I thought today was the day. 
 Maybe next time, Mom. 
 Okay. Maybe next time. 
 I'm going to go to the grocery store for you. 
 No, no, no, no, I'll go. 
 Karen... let... uh, let me go for you. 
 No, that's okay. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 You do something for me later, like bail me out of jail. 
 Frank? 
 Or stop me from having s*x with some ugly chick. 
 Frank? Yeah? 
 You forgot the list. 
 No, I-I... 
 Okay, yeah. 
 All right. 
 I think I can see my breath. 
 We need $587, or they won't turn the gas back on. 
 I'm taking the PSATs for some Polish kid over in Ridgedale. 
 He's supposed to give me, like, a hundred bucks. 
 I saw online that we can get an extra $200 a month from the state if we say Carl's retarded. 
 (blubbering) 
 I get paid Friday. 
 Okay, I'll figure out the rest. 
 School! Let's go. 
 Everyone out. I can loan you the money. 
 Unless you want to get it from Tony the cop. 
 You're still here? 
 Pay me back whenever... or not. Doesn't matter. 
 Let's go. You're going to be late. Go. 
 Everyone out. 
 You, too. Out. 
 You know, I could borrow a couple grand from you, Steve, and not pay you back. 
 Is this a rebound thing with Tony? 
 None of your business. Does he know the only reason you f*cked him was to get back at me? Get out. 
 LIP: Dude, you're such a rookie. 
 Is that your "A" game? 
 Bye, Fiona. Have a good one. 
 Fi, this oatmeal... 
 I don't know what you did with this oatmeal... 
 Thanks. 
 (door closing) 
 FIONA: What are you doing here? 
 Don't you have a new home? 
 I wanted to spend some quality time with my loving family. 
 Good, then you can spend it with Liam while I go to work. I can't. Busy day today. 
 Doing what? 
 There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes to keep this family running that you wouldn't know about, Fi... 
 Tits, it's cold in here. Why are you taking our food? 
 My food, you mean? 
 No, I mean, our food. 
 Which you paid for with food stamps that are funded by taxes that I pay. Since when? 
 You live here now? 
 Toaster. 
 (knocking) 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 To serve and protect, huh? 
 Serve and protect. 
 Kevin. 
 I see you got the flowers. 
 Yep. They're beautiful. 
 I had a really good time last night. Me, too. 
 I like you, Fiona. Thanks, Tony. 
 I've waited a long time for last night to happen. 
 FRANK: See ya. Coach of the Year's a big deal. 
 Out of butter. Last night was my first time. 
 I'm sure you'll win again. 
 No. In the car. That was my first time. 
 First time? 
 You mean first time with me? 
 No. First time ever. 
 But you've been with other girls. 
 Not in that way. 
 Tony, are you saying you were... 
 Virgin?! Yep. 
 Holy sh1t! You popped his cherry. 
 And how was the 30 seconds of bliss? 
 He actually lasted a while. 
 Did he cry after? 
 Oh, leave him alone. 
 He's a nice guy. 
 Oh so, it was a mercy f*ck? 
 Or did you sleep with Tony to get back at Steve? - What? 
 Come on, I saw the way you looked at Steve. Like a D-O-G in heat. 
 Not true. - You never looked at the other 95 guys that way. 
 Don't exaggerate. 94. 
 You should cut Steve some slack. He meant well. 
 You mean when he shipped my father off to a foreign country? 
 Yes, the foreign country of Canada. 
 At least Tony's not coming here getting all in my family's business. 
 Maybe that's what I want. 
 I'm sure Tony's mother would love that. 
 I hope he didn't tell her about last night. 
 I'm sure the neighborhood bitches did. 
 They saw us in the car. 
 You did it in a car? 
 How romantic. 
 (laughing) 
 (knocking) 
 Oh, sh1t. That's probably Tony's mother right there. 
 Careful. 
 Bitch might have a gun. 
 (laughing) 
 Yes? 
 Hi, my name's Abby Ruggiero. 
 Okay. 
 Can I speak with Virginia, please? 
 Who? 
 Virginia Louise Gallagher? 
 Isn't this her house? 
 Oh, Aunt Ginger. 
 Is she here? 
 Nope. 
 She lives in a nursing home in Wisconsin. 
 Well, I'm from the Office of the Inspector General. 
 We investigate instances of, uh, Social Security related fraud. 
 I have reason to believe someone may be cashing your aunt's checks without her consent. 
 Now, 12 years ago your aunt changed her address to a Mailboxes, Etc. 
 12 years ago? And you're here now? 
 Oh... 
 I got to go, but call me. Okay. 
 Look, I'm sure that my aunt's mail's being forwarded to her in Wisconsin. 
 All right, I'll tell you what we're gonna do here, miss. 
 I have your aunt's next Social Security check with me now. 
 How about I come back in the morning, say around 10:00, and deliver the check to your aunt in person? 
 That way I can meet her, ask a few questions, and clear this whole thing up.

 Mandy told us what you did, you piece of sh1t. 
 Get out here! He's gone. 
 There's a door in the back of the storeroom. 
 Alley. Alley!

 KASH: Ian. They're gone. 
 I swear to God, I didn't touch her, Kash. 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 His focus is math, and he wants to get into the National Merit Society. 
 Got it. 
 Also, I told Richie that your rates went up, so he's giving you $150. 
 You're good. 
 See you in three hours. 
 Be out in two. 
 E-O-R-K-J. 
 What do you think, Kev? 
 (sportscast playing) 
 I have no idea. 
 It's "joker." 
 Where the hell is Aunt Ginger, Dad? 
 And hello to you, too, my firstborn. 
 KEV: How you doing? 
 Can I get you something, cop lover? 
 No. Dad, does Aunt Ginger live in Wisconsin? 
 That's what I've told you. Right? 
 Then why was there a woman from the Social Security Department at the house, saying that Ginger cashes her checks in Chicago? 
 Ginger's in town, and she didn't call me? 
 After all I've done for that woman? 
 Oh, sh1t, Frank. You're cashing the checks. 
 What? - Do you know how much trouble you're going to be in? 
 Why all this sudden interest in Ginger, Fiona? 
 Now that you know there's money involved, you're looking for a little handout? 
 Well, that money is mine. 
 I'm the one who's taken care of Ginger all these years, I call her every week. 
 Hell, I've even visited her. 
 Good. 
 Then you can go get her and bring her home with you. 
 'cause that Social Security lady will be here in the morning with a Federal agent, to interview Ginger. 
 Fine. 
 (door opens and closes) 
 f*ckity f*ck f*ck f*ck.... 
 Plus, there's free appetizers, and that means it's like all you can eat. 
 Where do you think you're going, Frank? 
 Russell, my man. 
 You know you're not allowed in here anymore. 
 Is the kitchen closed already? 
 I'm talking about Christmas. 
 (bell ringing) 
 That was a total misunderstanding. 
 You're banned from the mission, Frank. 
 You, you know, the... the Big Guy says thou shalt forgive me. 
 Out. 
 All right. Ah... 
 I'm willing to put this whole matter behind us, if you'd just let me borrow an old lady for a few hours. 
 Wait, what... hold on. Just a few hours! 
 Just, can... will you stop? Stop... Okay. 
 I will be re-thinking my charitable contributions to this organization come holiday time. 
 MAN: Hey, what the f*ck? 
 Shut the f*ck up. 
 Mandy! Mandy. Hey, hey. 
 Get away from me, you perv! 
 Why'd you tell your brothers I attacked you? 
 If you don't get away from me, Ian Gallagher, I'll scream. 
 Please, I'm begging you. 
 You have to tell them the truth. They're going to kill me. 
 
 
 
 Good! Mandy! 
 Yeah. Thank you. Have a good day. 
 I got you, sir. 
 Uh, medium burger and fries. 
 Next! 
 I'll get the, uh, the chicken burrito special. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm sorry, I thought this was a food truck, do I have it wrong? 
 Are you stalking me? 
 If wanting a burrito is stalking you, I guess I am! 
 Not interested. Who's next? 
 One mistake, and now you want nothing to do with me. 
 One mistake? You kidnapped my father. 
 I was trying to help. Don't. 
 All right, I've apologized. Isn't that enough? 
 Leave me alone. 
 Listen, you would not be so pissed off if you didn't care. 
 You know nothing about me. 
 Then teach me! 
 Teach me. 
 Here's your burrito. 
 $6.50. 
 Hey. Keep the change. No, thanks. 
 Believe me, you need it more than I do. 
 An hour and 54 minutes. Now that's a record. 
 Yes. Now all we have to do is figure out how I can go back the same day, and take it again for another kid. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Hey, yo! 
 What do they want? 
 Mickey probably just wants to ask me out again. 
 What, you're not interested? 
 If you like the smell of cow sh1t. 
 (giggles) 
 Hey, got a B+ on that English paper you wrote for me. 
 Well, spread the word. Could use the business. 
 I heard they're letting Iggy out of juvie. 
 Yeah, yeah, Mom drove up to go get him. 
 Throwing a party for him or some sh1t this weekend. 
 Probably back in before then, yeah? 
 Ha ha, probably. 
 So, Ian messed with Mandy. 
 Ian? Yeah. 
 Well, that's, uh... that's highly unlikely. 
 That's what Mandy told us. 
 Well, trust me, you got the wrong guy. 
 Right. The problem is that Ian's been avoiding us all day, and, uh, someone's got to get a beat-down till we find him. 
 Could make an exception. 
 Not really, though. 
 Well, maybe, uh, Mandy's confusing Ian with any one of the other 400 dudes in the tenth grade she's already blown. 
 (grunting and groaning) 
 (door opening) 
 Hey, hey, hey, look who it is! Fiona. 
 And Liam! Come say hello to me, son. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I went to get Ginger, like you told me to. 
 (snoring) 
 This is Aunt Ginger? 
 In the flesh. 
 Ginger has a hard-on. 
 (knocking on door) 
 She was born with a large clitoris. 
 (babbling) 
 As kids, we were told to keep our hugs brief. 
 It's me, the virgin. 
 Uh, not anymore. Remember the car? Come on outside. 
 Uh... 
 You were right, I'm sorry. I should've told you beforehand. 
 A little heads-up would have been nice. 
 It's not the kind of thing you run around telling everyone. 
 Besides, I was afraid you wouldn't do it if you knew. 
 Probably wouldn't have. 
 It's-It's a big thing. 
 It's above average. 
 I know it seems weird I didn't have s*x till now, but it's not from a lack of trying. 
 Joni always wanted to wait till we got married, then she gave it up to Dickie Dolan, night before he shipped out for Fallujah, lost his leg. 
 Uh, almost did it with Houlie's sister Christmas Eve, but she was too drunk. 
 And Katie Jordan was super Catholic, so she'd only let me stick it in her b... 
 Okay. Okay, okay, I get it. 
 Hey, hey, uh... my mom heard about us. 
 What? 
 You know how the women in the neighborhood talk. 
 She... invited you to dinner. Tomorrow night. 
 I find that hard to believe. 
 Okay, maybe she's not that enthusiastic about it, but I... I told her you were coming. 
 Let me think about it? 
 Sure. Absolutely. Just, uh... just show up at 7:00? 
 All right. 
 You don't have to run away from me, Fiona. 
 I get you, I get your family. 
 Come on, Miss Lisa married us at the Little Red Schoolhouse when we were five. 
 That's got to count for something, right? 
 Hey, Lip. 
 There a body on the other end of that? 
 Nah, it's cool, Tone. 
 Jesus, what the hell, Lip? 
 Oh, for... 
 Uh... I'll see you. 
 The nose is the most commonly broken bone in boys between the ages of 13 and 25. 
 Yeah, that's, that's fascinating, but who's the old dude? 
 It's not a dude. 
 It's your Aunt Ginger. 
 Oh, the one who owns the house? 
 That's right. Ginger! 
 Say hello to your nephew! 
 Dad, stop. 
 Why-Why's he trying to pass off Mr. Perry as Aunt Ginger? 
 Who? 
 Mr. Perry, my old bus driver. 
 Now he sleeps by the Dumpster over at the A&P. 
 Social Security wants to talk to Ginger, and he was too lazy to go get the real one. 
 That's kind of retardedly brilliant. 
 Thank you. Or brilliantly retarded. 
 Thank you. 
 Now we have to drive all night to go get her. 
 Think Kev'll let us borrow his car? 
 No. 
 I'll call and beg. 
 We got these from Imelda over at the Holiday Inn. 
 It'll be a good way to stay warm. 
 Why's Mr. Perry here? 
 FIONA: Hey, Kev, it's me. 
 Uh, can I borrow your car just for the night? 
 I just need... 
 (mutters) 
 You won't need the car. 
 How are we gonna get Ginger? 
 She's dead. 
 What? 
 DEBBIE: Who's dead? 
 LIP: Aunt Ginger. 
 No! 
 LIP: Debs, you never met her. 
 And now I never will! 
 Don't give me a hard time. I've been very upset about this. 
 I'm in mourning. 
 When did she die? 
 Mmm, 12 years ago.

 How do you think I feel? 
 That woman was my heart and soul. 
 She practically raised me. 
 Dad, you've been cashing her checks. That's a felony. 
 We're living in her house. Was there even a will? 
 You don't need a will, if she's not technically dead. 
 Yes, she is technically dead, Dad. 
 Dead is dead. 
 Just because you haven't told anybody that she's dead, doesn't make her not dead. 
 f*ck! 
 What are we gonna do now? 
 Well... 
 Oh, Mrs. Sullivan is 92, but she's about to go any minute. 
 Helen... she needs meds every four hours, so she's a hassle. 
 Beatrice... her son visits daily. 
 Jenny... she's a favorite around here. 
 The others would notice if she were missing. 
 It's too bad. She's hot. 
 I like that one. 
 Debbie! 
 No, too lucid. 
 You know how your friend Sophie's nana couldn't remember anything 'cause she had old people's disease? Alzheimer's? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we're looking for somebody like that. 
 For the record, I do not want to be sent to a place like this. 
 Don't worry, you'll outlive us all. 
 You're not gonna get fired for letting us borrow an old lady, right? 
 Girl, please. This place is just like what you see on the news. 
 A month ago, one of the night shift guys got caught f*cking Mrs. Hebert who's in a coma.

 They're leaving. 
 IAN: This wouldn't be happening if I had just had s*x with her. 
 You can't be what you're not, Ian. 
 Shut up.  You  are. 
 I didn't know what I was until after I married Linda. 
 Yeah, well, from now on I'm just gonna be straight. 
 It's not that easy. 
 You do it. 
 'Cause I love my kids. Don't complicate things for yourself. 
 Now get up here. They're gone. 
 (engine starts) 
 (door closes) 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Everything is just the way I remember it. 
 We kept the house exactly the same, Aunt Ginger. 
 Oh, I can see that, dear. 
 Oh, look, there's the bookcase my brother Norman built. 
 Do you want me to show you to your room, Aunt Ginger? 
 Oh, that would be just wonderful. 
 And after I wash up, why don't I make us all some nice supper? 
 Okay. 
 MR. PERRY: Hey... 
 Wh-Where am I? 
 Dad.I'm on it. 
 Let's go, Perry. 
 Thanks.

 I was 26, and I was working as a secretary for the USO, and one of the dancers broke her foot. 
 And before you know it, they're pulling me off the typewriter and... and they're teaching me the dance steps for the show that very night. 
 Oh, from that point forward, I was a regular dancer. 
 Did you ever dance with anyone famous? 
 Dance? 
 No, honey, I'm not a dancer. 
 Let's see what's on now. 
 Yeah? 
 Is Ian here? 
 Upstairs. 
 Give him these, would ya? 
 Okay. 
 Well, if you need me, I'll be across the street in the bushes stalking you. 
 I saw you smile! 
 MICKEY: Hey! 
 Yeah, you. You, uh...you see Ian in there? Not home. 
 You know when he's coming back? 
 STEVE: No, man, not a clue. 
 Yeah, yeah, all right, fuckhead. 
 Hey, Lip! How's your lip? 
 Yeah, I saw you up there. 
 Tell your shithead brother we're waiting for him. 
 Sorry your face got busted up. 
 It's okay. 
 I didn't do anything to Mandy. 
 I know that, Ian, but her brothers think you did. 
 I mean, she tried to rape me, and I pushed her off, and now she's mad. 
 Well, you're probably the first guy in her life who hasn't tried to jump her. 
 She started screaming and crying. 
 Maybe you should throw it in her, you know? 
 She'll call her brothers off. 
 Yeah, yeah, and maybe, uh, you should throw it in Kash, right? 
 Why, is he asking about me? 
 Yeah, he's trying to go through all the Gallagher brothers. 
 Cool. 
 (chuckles) 
 Eventually, you're gonna have to take the beat-down for this, you know? 
 Yeah... 
 I know. 
 (sighs) 
 (snoring) 
 (door creaks) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (chatting indistinctly) 
 Smells good! 
 I've missed you, Ginger. 
 LIP: Yo, bud. Yeah? 
 You take the killing bat? No. 
 Bread. Thank you, dear. 
 We're making eggs Benedict, Lip. 
 Oh, great. 
 That woman will be here in 45 minutes. 
 You better be ready. 
 I pay that bureaucratic know-nothing her salary. 
 I'll be ready when I say I'm ready. 
 Eat some breakfast, Lip. 
 No, I gotta go. But save some for me, will ya, Debs? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 It's essential that families share meals together. 
 Oh, don't! Oh... 
 Mmm! 
 Mm. 
 That's great, Debs. Thanks. 
 (microwave beeping) 
 Who's that? 
 That's my dad. 
 (gasps) 
 sh1t! 
 Jesus. 
 So what's the plan? 
 Hit Mickey over the head with the bat when he comes out of the house. 
 What about the other brothers? 
 They'll probably beat me to death. 
 I'll fight 'em off while you run. 
 This is my problem, all right? Not yours. 
 It'll be fun. I owe 'em one. 
 (door opening) 
 (door closing) 
 sh1t. 
 Mandy. Mandy. 
 Hey... Get away from me, you f*cking perv! 
 We need to talk. 
 You are a dead man, Ian Gallagher! 
 f*cking dead! 
 I'm gay. 
 AUNT GINGER: Linseed oil works the best on maple furniture. 
 Linseed oil, maple... got it. 
 You got it, sweetheart. 
 We should never send her back. 
 (knocking at door) 
 ABBY: Miss Gallagher, this is Federal Agent Salinger. 
 FIONA: Right on time. 
 Come on in. 
 (sighs) 
 (shouting): Mrs. Gallagher! 
 My name is Abby, and I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 My name is Abby, and I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 Mrs. Gallagher, how old are you? 
 I don't remember. 
 Well, my records say that you're 93. 
 (shouting): How are you feeling? 
 Oh, wait, now I remember. 
 Ricky Ricardo and I did the salsa together one night. 
 (sighs) 
 For how long? 
 I don't know. My whole life, I guess. 
 Maybe since Justin Timberlake. 
 Ew. 
 No. JC Chasez. 
 No, are you kidding? He's totally gay. 
 No, he isn't. 
 Hello, yes, he is. 
 Are you sure you're not just making this up? 
 About JC Chasez? 
 No... about being gay. 
 In this neighborhood? 
 Why would I make that up? 
 Look, you and Lip are the only two who know, all right? 
 I won't tell anyone. 
 Thanks. 
 It's just that I thought maybe you were making this up so I'd call my brothers off. 
 Or, I don't know. 
 Maybe... you think I'm, like, ugly or something. 
 Mandy, you're beautiful. 
 Look, this has nothing to do with the way you look. 
 I'm just not wired that way. 
 See? Nothing. 
 (chuckles) 
 You can expect a visit from me every six months. 
 Yeah, 'cause this is such a great use of government funds. 
 Hey, maybe next time you can check that my Uncle Harold is taking his Lipitor. 
 Oh, wait, that's right. 
 He doesn't get Lipitor anymore, since you canceled his Medicare. 
 Good thing I've got some  amigos  down in Mexico. 
 Here you are. 
 93... she won't live long. 
 Let's go. 
 Huh! 
 Don't...! 
 (grunts) 
 Now I can pay the gas bill. No! No! No! 
 Wait, wait. 
 Fiona, seriously. 
 No, no... 
 (groans) 
 I also danced with Cab Calloway. 
 He had the first colored pen1s I ever kissed. 
 My work here is done. 
 You're not going anywhere until we take her back to the nursing home. 
 She's never heard of a bus pass? 
 Aunt Ginger has to go back? 
 Rice Krispie Treats, anyone? 
 Don't make her go. 
 She can't stay, Debs. 
 But she didn't mean to pee in the plant. 
 Please, she can't go back to the nursing home. 
 I'll take care of her. I promise. 
 She doesn't belong to us. 
 Debs, you can come visit anytime you want. 
 Besides, you can borrow her every six months. 
 Borrow what?! 
 Aw, sh1t. 
 FIONA: We should take Debs to visit the real Ginger's grave. 
 Where's she buried? 
 (door closes) 
 Dad? Huh? 
 Um... 
 Here. 
 What?! 
 I could pretend to be your girlfriend at school and stuff. 
 Then no one would ever give you a hard time. 
 You'd do that for me? 
 Sure. It'd keep the creepy guys away from me. 
 Besides... 
 I've never actually had a real boyfriend before. 
 Well, not that you'd be a real boyfriend. 
 But a boyfriend I could do things with, instead of... you know, just getting finger-banged all the time. 
 (laughing) 
 What a pretty little girl she is. 
 Rice Krispie Treats, anyone? Debs, it's okay. 
 I got you. It's okay. Rice Krispie Treats. 
 I made them myself. They're delicious. 
 I really worked very hard. 
 I'd appreciate it if you would take one. 
 I know. So sorry. Oh, you ladies are so busy, you might get sticky fingers. 
 He's pretty busy, too. 
 (sobbing) 
 It's okay. I know. 
 It's okay. Somebody wants my Rice Krispies. 
 Oh, ladies. Oh, you're so talented. 
 I wish I could do... But I'm a very busy... 
 You go ahead... 
 Everyone has to take one... 
 And would you like one, sir? 
 It's okay. Let's go home. He looks pretty busy. 
 She's okay now. Everyone's so busy. 
 Ladies... 
 Well, we came for a visit. She wasn't in her room. 
 None of the staff knew where she was. 
 WOMAN: After we called the police to file a missing persons report, she just walked through the front door as if nothing had happened. 
 She keeps calling herself Abby, and she says that she'd like to ask us a few questions. 
 AUNT GINGER: Oh, you ladies are so busy... 
 It's so scary out there, Frank. 
 (indistinct voices over TV) 
 (sniffles) 
 (knocking) 
 Hey. 
 Above the covers. 
 You got it. 
 You look nice. Thank you.
