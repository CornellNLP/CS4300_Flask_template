 MAN:  Nobody's saying our neighborhood is the Garden of Eden. 
 Hell, some people say God avoids this place altogether, but it's been a good home to us... to me and my kids, who I'm proud of, 'cause every single one of them reminds me a little bit of me. 
 Fiona, my rock, huge help. 
 Has all the best qualities of her mother, except she's not a raging psycho bitch. Blow. Lip, smart as a whip. Straight "A"s and the honor roll. Boy's definitely going somewhere. (siren wailing) MAN: You, come back! Stop! Ian, industrious, conscientious, ambitious, incredible work ethic. Don't have a clue where he got that from. Wants to be a paratrooper. Knows how to disembowel an enemy with a roll of dimes and an old gym sock. Carl. Uh, I don't really know that much about Carl. Oh, loves animals. Always dragging home some poor stray he found, taking them up to his room. (meows) Ah, Debbie. Sent by God, total angel. Raises money for UNICEF year-round, some of which she actually turns in. Liam, going to be a star. I'm no biologist, but he looks a little bit like my first sponsor. He and the ex were close. Kev and Veronica, fantastic neighbors. There's nothing they won't do for each other. Or to each other. That didn't hurt half as much as I thought it would. I never realized how little s*x I was having till V and Kev moved next door. And me, Frank Gallagher, father, teacher, mentor, captain of our little ship. We may not have much, but all of us, to a man, knows the most important thing in this life... we know how to f*cking party!

Coming through. Electric. Electric. Electric. No. You've got a Happy Meal on the front of that shirt. Oh, um, field trip. Need Dad's signature. DEBBIE: Okay. Arms up. LIP: Wow, Deb, that's getting really good. FIONA: Who's got the phone? I got it. Any minutes left? Uh, 14. Hey, I need something for show-and-tell. How much are we short? $18.30. Oh, I'm tutoring after school. I should be able to kick in like ten more. IAN: Hey, did, uh, Carl put in any? LIP: Mmm. DEBBIE: You're almost nine. You're going to have to start pulling your weight. That's right, and get a real job, not just dipping into the collection plate at St. Tim's. I'm filling in for Candi. I can cover the rest. Extra kraut on mine. IAN: Cheese on mine. Somebody's got to take Liam. Uh, I got a calculus test. I'm working after school. Show-and-tell? Show them the birthmark on his back. It looks like Latvia. ♪ I want you to be true ♪

Who's got the jumbo dog? How'd you know? X-ray vision. Hey. Would you tap that ass? Once, if I double-bagged it. Project girls don't abort. (knocking) Uh, hi. I'm here to help Karen study for her midterm. Okay. You have to take your shoes off. What? I'll get you a plastic bag. Here you go. GIRL: She's got this thing about people bringing dirt in the house. Molysmophobia. Oh. LIP: Right. (TV playing) Okay, so, um... if you remember it like this, the... the formula is completely visible. Um... okay. Midget naked witch is bending over, and she's crying 'cause she lost one ear and she can't find it. How do you know all this? Uh, just something I like to fool around with. Like a hobby? Uh, no. More like a plan. Physics? Yeah, yeah. Have you done Newton's first? I've got a great one for that. Um, "Everybody continues "in a state of rest or uniform motion "unless acted upon "by an external... (zipping) force." Uh, hang on. Karen, I'm, uh... I'm still going to have to charge you for this.

Yeah? I'm using Ian's. (sighs) If I stick this in the washer VERONICA: Fiona, where are you? before I go out, keep an eye on it? Uh, do it tomorrow. God, it stinks in here. Oh, sorry. There's a shirt I need. VERONICA: Fiona! We need to go if we're going to get a ride to the club. Hey, five minutes. Look at me. No, this has got to go back tomorrow. I'll put it back on later. I have a tag gun at home. What? From when I worked at T. J.Maxx. Let's go. Hot dogs downstairs. Nachos, too. Have fun. Bye, Lip! (footsteps, muffled speech) IAN: Hey, Veronica. Hey.

Stupid, but, man, heroic. Uh, Steve. Uh, my name is Steve. Uh, I was... going to offer to buy you a drink anyway. Oh. She'll take a drink. (chuckling) Hey, where do you think you're going? Uh... Are you serious? Where's his stamp? Can you believe this joker? If you were doing your job, he wouldn't have had to. No stamp, no reentry. Is he for real? Fat prick. Fine. You're all barred. For what? Uh, drugs. What? He probably let them get away 'cause he knows them. Shut up, skank. Watch your mouth. Or you're going to do what? FIONA: Okay. Okay, forget it. Please, forget it. Okay. Come on, let's... let's get a cab. Thank you. Come on. VERONICA: Oh! Oh, sh1t! (people exclaiming) (horns honking) MAN: Watch it! Hey, fucker! (Fiona and Veronica whooping) (laughing) (dog barking in distance) Got a hummer today. (scoffs) What's the law on s*x with pets? From Karen Jackson. No way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She got a "C" in physics. Needed a "B." Or you, uh... you wouldn't have waited this long to tell me. Oh, five hours. (laughs) Okay, you're full of sh1t. f*ck you. You ever have a knob job? Once or twice. Oh. Wow. I didn't hear you rushing to tell me. Yeah, well. I mean, I thought... we tell each other everything. Unless... You got sucked off by a guy. For instance. VERONICA (muffled): No way. Lake Forest... Lake Forest is not Chicago. (raucous laughing) FIONA: I'm not kidding, Steve. You are dead if he ever lays eyes on you. And I mean dead. I nearly peed myself when you hit him. Well, I did a little. (laughing) FIONA: Hey. Hi. Wait, how many of you guys live here? VERONICA: Not me, I'm one down. But the old guy next door died in March, which I guess technically makes us next-door neighbors. So you're a nurse, Veronica? Used to be. Lying bitch. She worked housekeeping at Cook County, bedpans and shit-sheets. Fine. But I was offered a place in the nursing school. Fine. But it never happened. They fired her for selling medical supplies on eBay. Will you shut up? We don't even know him. Steve. Carl. Lip. Debbie. How you doing, Debbie? Nice watch. Oh, thanks. Panerai. What'd that set you back, about six bills? Plus, Ian. Hey. Hey, Debbie, why do they call him "Lip"? His real name's Philip. Yo, Veronica! You got my keys? What's going on here? This is Steve. Decked the bouncer at Purgatory to defend my honor. (snorts) My honor. Yeah? Which bouncer? Jimmy Clifton. Jimmy Cli... Well, Jesus, man, put it there! Respect! Guy just stands there, doesn't really do anything. Yeah, you'll be his third conviction. Huh? Third or fourth. Fourth. Yeah. I mean, after that much practice, you would think the man would have manslaughter down by now. No more fuck-ups like last time, like leaving his dad still breathing. His dad. Yeah. Five years, over an '87 Monte Carlo with 200,000 miles on the odometer. f*cking Monte Carlo! Okay, come on, time for bed. Up the wooden hill. Come on. CARL: It's not even midnight yet! DEBBIE: Aw, man. Come on, come on, go! Already? Shut up. Move, move, move, move, come on. (groans) Yeah, let me take one last look at you, while you're still alive! (laughing) Here. What, that's his? Yeah. Well, company car. What kind of company? Internet startup? Earning what? Couple mil a year. High school dropout. Got a job as a janitor in this small tech firm. Within a year, he owned it. Made his first billion by 20. Two Jags, controlling interest in the Red Wings, 10,000 employees kissing his ass. "Yes, boss. No, boss." Why shouldn't he ride around in style? Oh, you just made that up. (snorts laughter) What...? Why do you do that? Your face! How is that even funny? It's not even funny... How the f*ck would I know how much he earns, you twisted dumb prick? I'm not a dumb prick. Kevin, I just met the guy an hour ago. Take back "dumb prick"! Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Veronica. What's your pre-tax income? Well, you sure didn't mind watching him take his shirt off, now, did you? Huh? Not one bit. In fact, if you hadn't walked in, Fiona and I were going to knock him down and tag-team him. Now I guess I'm stuck with you. Hold on. The Fiona tag-team, is that an option? (both chuckling) 'Cause you know, you can throw that in the mix... (laughing) Anytime you like it, too... I'll be doing it, all right... (both laughing) (heels clack down the stairs) All quiet up the "wooden hill"? As quiet as it ever gets. Straight answer: if I hadn't busted my skull for you tonight, would you have looked at me twice? Who's saying that I looked twice? Oh, you did, then. I can't. (sighs) You know, 90% of the world's problems are caused by tiny words that come in pairs. I mean, we're healthy and we're happy, but when people ask, we say... "Not bad." You know, the first time that I saw you dancing, about a month back at Crobar, I was desperate to buy you a drink. You know, normally I'm shy, so I told myself: I can't. She won't. We wouldn't. And then tonight I see you there again. All the indications being that I'm getting... (zipper being unfastened) ...a second chance to make a good impression. Tell me to stop, and I'll stop. Take it slower, slower, slower, slower. Slower. (whispers): Slower. Slower. (dishes clattering) (gasps) (dishes clattering) (moaning) (thud, clattering) (moaning) Ah! Ah! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Almost... almost... (knock on door) (panting) MAN (outside): Fiona? sh1t. sh1t, sh1t! MAN (outside): Fiona! sh1t. MAN: Fiona, are you home? Is Fiona in? Uh... she's upstairs. I'll go get her. Hey. Oh. Yeah, uh, cops looking for you. Stay here. DEBBIE: Liam. Liam? FRANK (slurred): You... you... (slurred ranting) I wouldn't put him anywhere near a carpet till his pants dry a bit. Thanks, Tony. (Frank yells) See you, Fiona. Who the hell is that? My dad. You just leave him there all night? He's never there when I get up. So, uh, who's the little guy? Liam? Liam's my brother. (sighs) (door opens, closes) (people speaking indistinctly in distance) (car alarm chirps) Rita. Anne's school called. She's sick. Everything up to 204 is clean. I should be back in a couple of hours. Raul won't care? He smoked his lunch again. He won't even know. I'm making tamales tonight. I'll drop off a dozen. Okay. Adios... Oh, and take all the toilet paper you need. Okay. You ready, big man? Let's do it. Come on. Here we go. FRANK: Kevin, did you miss me, dear? A beer and a bump. And, uh... Billy, you having one? Have one! (chuckles) Go away, Frank. A pen, Mr. Beerkeep, it is disability day. Disability people haven't caught up with you yet? I thought they had some guy following you around with a camera. They can follow me around all they want to, but they have to actually catch me doing something. What's with the crowd? Layoff at the Chrysler plant. You see? That's the problem with working. Too much instability. Stress! What the f*ck is this? What's left, after I settled out last month's bar tab. (whistles, groans) Better start a new one, then. Oh! And a round for all my friends from the UAW. (cheering) Wow. Really? f*ck no. (rhythmic tapping) (tapping continues, washing machine humming quietly) (knocking) (washing machine stops) Hi. Wondering what your schedule's like on Friday. Uh, I've got a... I've got a party. Want a chaperone? You're not eligible. Right. Chick thing? You're not that desperate. Wanting to see you again is desperate? No, feeling like you have to... that's desperate. Come on, you can get laid anywhere. Oh, so I'm only here for a f*ck? Never crossed your mind? Just when you think you've collared your dream girl, her incontinent, alcoholic father appears, wrecks everything, and she's blaming you? Your dream girl? We had drunken s*x on my kitchen floor. (chuckles): Pretty sad. Quit pretending you don't even know me. You weren't that drunk. Hey, it's Phillip. Hey, it's, uh, Dead Man Walking. Jimmy Clifton called today looking for you. No school? Nah, I got some teeth pulled today. Wisdom teeth? Sugar rot. Ah. You know, little known fact: don't just chew your food on one side, 'cause it can buckle your jaw, which will buckle your hips and affect your posture. Oh, that's a fact? Skeletal fact. Lip. Hey, um, talk out of your ass with that much conviction, you end up needing a much bigger toothbrush. That's a a**l fact. (chuckles) (washing machine humming) Listen, thank you for trying to get my purse back and, uh, stuff. But, uh... Stuff? I'm not looking. Not right now. Okay. Is it all right if I leave my number for when you might be? LIP:  Relax, okay? No. No, no, you're gonna like it. What am I, what am I even gonna say, all right? You just got to keep talking about science. I don't know anything about science. Okay, so just read from the table of elements. Cerium, erbium, praseodymium. (knocking) Mrs. Jackson. Oh! Karen is thrilled with you. She got an "A" on her physics midterm! Karen! Honey, your little helper is here. This is my brother Ian. Um, I'm out of plastic bags. Why don't you leave your shoes out here where they can breathe. Sure. Mix these two together... IAN: Erbium, cerium, praseodymium, magnesium... You kids want some homemade lime chicken chimichangas? Um, no, no, thanks, Sheila. I think we're fine. No? All right. Uh, praseodymium, uh, magnesium, sulfur... MAN: All right, I'm off to work. Hey, fellas. Where's Karen? Uh, her room. I think Google Earth for a GPS reference on where Isaac Newton was born. (grunting softly) SHEILA: Guess what I made for your lunch. Cornish game hen with Asian pear. No. Wild salmon with baby carrots. No. Kiss and I'll tell. I'll find out what I got when I open the damn box, all right? All right, I'm late, Karen, honey! I guess I'll see you in the morning.! What's she hiding for? What are you hiding... ...for? Ah, sweet Jesus. (slow-motion): No...! ("Get Free" by The Vines playing) (Karen screams) ♪ I'm gonna get free, I'm gonna get free ♪

Jesus, Fiona! Can't remember whether that's good or bad. (groans) More likely, you two jumped the turnstiles again and he twisted it trying to outrun the transit cops. No, no! Always elevate extremities! Move before you give him a f*cking embolism. You okay, Lip? Sweetheart? Yeah, just please don't... don't touch it. Okay. Wiggle your toes. (groans) Go to my house, top of the freezer. Yeah. Two ice packs. Second cupboard above the sink. Yeah. Liquid ibuprofen, freeze spray, ACE bandages. Sure. Shouldn't we get it X-rayed? f*ck no. He'll be in the E.R. forever, and for what? "Submetatarsal hematoma." Thanks. Tell us something we didn't know five hours ago. f*ck off. My bedroom, top of the TV. Yeah. Pack of smokes and a lighter. (knocking) sh1t! I'm not here! I'm not here! What...? You don't know us, Fiona! Oh, what have you done? What have you done?! (mechanical whirring) Can I get it through here, is it better coming around the back? Samsung washer. It's not me. Gallagher, number 2119? Yeah, but that's not ours. Well, it's paid for. You want me to hook it up or not? (sighs) 
 
 Where you going with those? Uh, Veronica wants them. Well, give me one. (sighs) (music begins playing) ♪ Oh, oh ♪ 
♪ Everybody say oh, oh. ♪ (music stops) Got it? Okay. Ice and Advil. And keep your weight off of it. I thought you were broke. That's what I said. These were in the washer. Steve? Yeah. No. Uh-huh. Who's Steve? The other night. No. I know. (laughs) EDDIE:  15 years! 15 years! I've done everything in my control... What did I say?! What did I tell you?! Sow and thou shall reap. Well, she didn't reap this from me, I'll tell you that. Reap what? Wh-what are you reaping now? Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. Whatever it is, I'll try. I'll-I'll... I'll really try. KAREN: Mom, don't beg him. If he can do this, then the b*st*rd's not worth it! Hey, you honor thy father! Get f*cked! Don't try blaming me for this! (grunts) You're your own worst enemy, you two. They say bad things happen in three; they don't. Twos! You two! Insane. STEVE: Hello. How much you pay for it? I'm not telling you that. It's a gift. So you'd remember the phone number, which obviously worked. Your washer's in the yard, okay? We don't need it, I don't want it. So you got to come pick it up before it starts rusting. Oh, is it? No. Did the guy connect it? Yes. It's working okay? It's not my favorite color. Oh, so you've tried it. (phone beeps, snaps shut) (car engine revving) (phone beeps) (Arabic music playing) Let me smell your breath. (exhales) Pork rinds? No. Um, those are mine. See? Hey, since when do pork rinds actually come from a pig? Ian, I am the one that signs your check. What's bad for him is really bad for you. If you are stupid enough to start lying for him... They're just corn chips with fake hair, fake corn even. Last warning. You get yourself to that mosque so your dad stops blaming me for the fact that we're all going to hell. And talk to your mother. She won't talk to me. I can't force her to take her meds. Well, I don't want the cops dragging me out of bed again at 4:00 a.m. because she's out in the alley yelling that the CIA is stealing her trash. But that happened, didn't it? Once. Four years ago, yes. But now she's locked in the basement, making a helmet out of tinfoil. Enough's enough! Boys, come on, let's go. Get in the car. Now, I have to take the boys to Cub Scouts at the mosque before all the carpets are taken. She's your mother; get her to take her Thorazine. No, boys, no candy. Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late. Let's go, go, go, go, go. No more! Come on, we're gonna be late. Hurry up. (laughs) (dog barking in distance) (sighs softly) (refrigerator motor chugging) (Frank snoring) Just tell me you didn't go and get some girl pregnant. No worries. (chuckles softly) He hates me. (snoring) You just, you look more like mom than any of the rest of us. You probably scare him. Yeah? Yeah. He ain't seen nothing yet. Did he give you money for the field trip? I'll pay my own way, all right? No, you won't. (coins rattling) (chuckles) You mustet sick of having to think for everybody. Well, at least I can. Proves I'm wanted. Jesus, Fiona, if all you want is to be needed then, congratulations. (snoring) You've got yourself a job for life with is joker. Hey. Get up. (snoring) Dad, get up. Get up! (snoring) Good job, Fiona. I don't know how I could do this without you. Thanks for all your hard work. You're welcome, Dad. My pleasure. (snoring) (sighs) Hmm. (snoring continues) Good night, Daddy. (snoring) (phone line ringing) STEVE: Hello. If that wasn't bullshit, what was I wearing? Huh? First time you saw me, if that wasn't a lie. Black top with gold trim, black shiny jeans, thin shoes... straps... Sandals. With your hair pinned high. Dangly gold earrings that made me smile. A big watch... too big, so it slid up your arm. But it looked great. And you were dancing next to red-haired girl in a green dress. Yeah, yeah, Jenna. It was Jenna's birthday. So you were... you were watching her, who's a lot better looking than me. You think so? Really? Yeah, so how come you're not stalking Jenna? Because you... you think like that and Jenna doesn't. Jenna dances for an audience. You dance like there's no one else in the room. Your life's not simple, Fiona, and you can't stop it from showing because you're no fake. You're not lost, you don't need finding. This whole city belongs to the Jennas, but I'm sick of them. I swear, Fiona, you're nothing like anyone I've ever met. You make me want to enjoy my life again. Are you there? Fiona? ♪ ♪ STEVE:  Whoa, whoa, whoa , whoa, whoa, wait. What have I ever done to anybody, never mind you, that made me look unreliable? Un... unreliable. People like you are just way too used to getting your own way. And by people like me you mean people like what? Okay, wait, all right. Yes-no. All you got to do is agree or disagree. He thinks the sun shines out of his own ass. Agree or disagree. Agree. He's overly generous and that bugs me. Agree. Because I'm not used to get... Actually very agree. Because I'm not used to getting spoiled. Agree. Okay. So I lose respect for guys like Steve because people unlike Steve or people diametrically opposite to Steve have always let me down. So deciding that he's overeducated and has more money than sense is somehow more socially acceptable than asking myself, for instance, why do the men I always date treat me like sh1t? f*ck you. It's a question. f*ck you. Either-or. Agree. He's had a easy life. Definitely. And you prefer a guy who's been around the block a few times. What if I do? Say, D block of a maximum security prison? If he knew how to have fun, yeah, sure. Fiona, I can't help my upbringing. So how come it's me again having to apologize for mine? Who's asking you to? We finished here, guys? We're working on it. You want to wait outside while I pay the bill? Sure. He's on break? Any second now. All right. ("Devil In Me" begins playing) ♪ Well, I can't ♪ Good evening, sir.

Stuff that he's never heard of, stuff I think he might like, 'cause I want him to like the same things that I do. And a couple Sox tickets for his birthday. So what's that make you, Lip, huh? It makes you wrong, you f*cking smart asshole! Now go back to Kash and promise him that you're not gonna tell anybody 'cause he's done nothing to be sorry for, nothing.

Who's been eating my porridge? Hey, Dad. This is Steve. Oh, no, no, no, we met before, but you weren't exactly... (Fiona clears throat) How much do you weigh? Uh, I don't know. That would fit me.
