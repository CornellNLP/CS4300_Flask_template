 JASMINE: No lattes or anything, but they did have hot chocolate for Debbie. 
 Thanks. And thanks for driving. 
 But, but you don't have to stay. 
 Oh, it's cool. I'll hang for a bit. 
 Tony! Did you see them? 
 Still in back. When can I see them? 
 If Lip's not charged as an adult, you can see them both in court tomorrow. 
 Charged as an adult? 
 He's 17, they may charge him with felony grand theft auto. 
 There's no way that Lip would steal a car. He's too smart. 
 And Ian doesn't even drive. 
 If they didn't steal it... They didn't steal it! 
 If they didn't, then they have to tell the detectives who gave them the car and agree to testify. 
 If they don't give up a name, Lip could do five years. 
 If I get convicted, I can't enlist. 
 What? 
 In the Marines? 
 Good. I was planning on kneecapping you in your sleep to keep you out of Kandahar anyway. 
 I was hoping for Korengal. 
 Isn't that where, uh, Todd Iggulden's brother lost a foot? 
 Got him the Silver Star. Yeah? 
 And a handicapped placard to hang from the mirror of his mom's Civic. 
 BERNERO: Phillip Gallagher. 
 No relation to our favorite overnight guest Frank, I hope. 
 Son. You're Frank's kid? 
 And this is your first felony bust? 
 Getting a little late start for a Gallagher, aren't you? 
 Slow study, I guess. 
 And Ian. 
 Another Frank progeny? 
 'Fraid so. 
 You always let your brother speak for you, Ian? 
 He's mute. 
 I can talk. 
 BERNERO: So, what... you two geniuses stole a Porsche Cayenne and, what, decided to go on a little late-night White Castle run? 
 Come on, Ian. 
 You do not want to do time. 
 Not with that face. 
 I stole the car. 
 Ian didn't know anything about it. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Set 'em up, Mr. Barkeep. 
 Just had last call, Frank. 
 So there's still time. 
 All right. One. 
 Rot-gut. 
 Cheapest stuff you got in the house. 
 So, uh, Kev. 
 Just out of curiosity, do you happen to know the age of consent in Illinois? 
 FIONA: Come on, come on, pick up, pick up. 
 STEVE (over voice mail): It's me. Leave a message. 
 (voice mail tone sounds) 
 Steve. Lip and Ian have just been arrested driving a stolen car. 
 Did they get it from you? 
 Did they? 
 Where the f*ck are you? 
 (gasping) 
 What happened to you? 
 (coughs) 
 Pick-up hockey game. 
 What were you, the puck? 
 Hey, where's my Cayenne? 
 Beeler called. Said you never showed. 
 I don't know. It should've been there by now. 
 You're supposed to be delivering it yourself. Yeah, I was out looking for that 911 that you wanted. 
 I wanted the Cayenne. 
 Beeler needs it in the container before the ship leaves for Dubai. Yeah, don't worry about it. 
 (keypad beeping) 
 (phone line ringing) 
 Come on, come on... 
 (phone ringing) 
 It's almost 1:00... I got to get going before, uh, Hal decides I'm having another affair. 
 Let me drive you home. 
 You can get some sleep, and then come back first thing in the morning. 
 Thanks. I'm gonna stay. 
 Do you want me to take Debbie? 
 She could sleep at our house tonight. 
 I want to stay with Fiona. 
 Thanks for driving. 
 Give you a call tomorrow. Make sure everything's okay. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (grunts) 
 I saw you from the window. 
 Are you cold? 
 Yeah. 
 Aw. 
 You're out of the house again. 
 Yeah. 
 Every day a few more steps. 
 I'm up to 13. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, sweet man. 
 Let's get you a nice warm bath. 
 Jail? Why didn't you call me? 
 Jasmine was there. Who? 
 FIONA: One of the moms from Deb's school. 
 She was there when the cops called. 
 She gave us a ride. You were there all night? 
 Yeah. Till they moved them downtown. 
 What about a lawyer? 
 They gave them a public defender for their first court appearance. 
 f*ck that. We need a real one, not some just-got-out-of- law-school liberal do-gooder with a 2,000 ghetto-kid caseload. 
 ETHEL: She's right. 
 My husband's public defender never even met Clyde before the arraignment, then suggested he plead guilty to child molestation and sexual abuse. 
 What about Dickie Day? He helped Marty out with that arson thing. 
 Marty got six years. 
 Tony says the judge might just release Ian to me... I mean, he doesn't have priors. 
 Yeah, but what about Lip? 
 They might charge him as an adult. 
 He's had a couple scrapes with the cops. 
 DEBBIE: Truancy, shoplifting, drinking, and that fight where he fractured Cam Matlock's cheekbone. 
 But no felonies, though. 
 Stolen Porsche, you said? 
 Mm. Still no Steve? 
 Steve? 
 Steve! 
 sh1t, Steve. 
 Yeah? 
 A couple of kids were brought in here last night... Gallagher? 
 Has bail been set yet? 
 Turk, take 12-36. 
 Jackson backed 12-17 into a hydrant on Halsted last night. 
 Trashed the back end! 
 Uh, it-it's Gallagher. 
 It's, it's Phillip and Ian. 
 (typing) 
 No bail. Haven't been arraigned yet. 
 Probably make it into court sometime later today or tomorrow. Thank you. 
 I'm worried about her, Frank. 
 After everything she's been through with her father, the humiliation and, and rejection... 
 I-I'm just so worried that she's going to make some terrible mistake that she regrets the rest of her life. 
 Hi, sweetie. How did you sleep? 
 Karen, sweetie? 
 Do you want to have some breakfast? 
 Don't go to the basement yet. 
 Come and sit with us. 
 (door closes) 
 More cookies to sell? 
 Is Jimmy here? 
 No. 
 He's back in school in Michigan. 
 No. 
 He's living 96 blocks away on the South Side, dating my sister, stealing cars, and going by the name of Steve. 
 (door opens) 
 Look... there's no easy way to say this, but we have to stop. 
 It's my boy. 
 Lip. 
 I'm sorry, I can't do it to him. 
 You and me, I mean, it-it was amazing. 
 Earth-shattering. 
 The world turned on its axis and all of that. 
 It was for me, too. 
 And you, so young and sexy and taut and tight and... 
 But I'm... 
 I'll still be there for you, of course. 
 If you need help with your homework or you need me to teach you how to drive or... the toilet needs plunging. 
 You know, normal things between a man and his girlfriend's daughter. 
 But you and me... a man has to be able to look his son in the eye. 
 A man... has to have the courage to fight the things in his nature that... you understand... his passions, his needs and desires. 
 Well, okay. 
 There, I've said it. 
 You go back to Lip, I'll go back to your mother. 
 Yes? Okay? 
 Good. Good. 
 Here, here. 
 Get yourself something nice. 
 (tires screech) 
 What the hell is that? 
 Your Cayenne. 
 Supposed to be black. 
 Paint it. 
 (sighs) 
 What? 
 I need my end. 
 You'll get it when I get it. 
 No, I need it now. 
 You... all right, I got a job. 
 Not interested. 
 Bring me two Lexuses. 
 Black if possible, 450 LS's. 
 There's only three grand in here. 
 Look, bring me the 450s, I'll give you ten grand next week. 
 I'm not gonna be here next week; I'm not gonna be here tomorrow. 
 All right, come back tonight, I'll get you the ten grand. 
 What? 
 Hold onto my money, I'll be back for it. 
 Detective. 
 Yeah? 
 Case landed on your desk last night... Gallagher, Phillip and Ian? 
 Yeah. 
 What's it going to take to let them walk? 
 Markovich, is it? 
 You related somehow? 
 They're from my neighborhood. 
 Good kids. 
 Lip's bright as hell, doing great at school. 
 Ian's in ROTC, wants to join the Marines. 
 They wouldn't have been in that car if they knew it was stolen. 
 So, uh, you just know them from around the neighborhood, is that it? 
 I'm pretty close to their sister. 
 Oh. 
 They get off, I promise, I'll kick their asses up and down the block. 
 Well, they gotta tell me who gave them that car. 
 They won't snitch and you know it. 
 Then they're doing time. 
 Bears tickets. 
 45 yard line, 23 rows up. 
 You pick the game. 
 Two games. 
 (sniffs) 
 All eight games next season. 
 Fine. 
 Preseason and playoffs. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 (Fiona and Lip grunt) 
 KEVIN: Ah! 
 You guys popped your cherry! 
 Hey, did you guys see my dad in there? 
 (laughter) 
 They give you a cavity search? 
 No, we weren't there long enough. 
 Think it was probably on the menu, though. 
 Hey, it's Karen. Leave a message. 
 Hey, Karen, it's me. 
 Um, call me back when you get this message, all right? 
 See anybody get shanked? 
 We were cuffed to a bench in a hallway most of the night, Carl. 
 (knock, door opens) 
 Clean towels. 
 You both need showers; you're rank. 
 I'll go first. 
 They take your belts and shoelaces so you wouldn't hang yourselves? 
 Carl, go help Veronica with dinner. 
 I helped with breakfast. You pulled out a cereal bowl. 
 Go. 
 So? 
 I'm sorry, Fiona. 
 It was stupid. 
 Could have ended up in prison. 
 Where'd you get the stolen car? 
 Lip's not here, okay? 
 I'm asking you. 
 Was it from Steve? 
 Hey, Fiona. 
 I'm gay. 
 I know. 
 I should have told you a long time ago. 
 I-I don't know why I didn't. 
 You're still on my sh1t list.

 Me? Got it in spades. 
 Ah! 
 Lip and Ian were released. 
 Released from what? 
 Jail. 
 Huh. 
 About time, too. 
 You must struggle with temptation, Kevin. 
 Nubile, young temptress traipsing around your house. 
 In and out of the bathroom in her dainty little undies. 
 Are you talking about Ethel? 
 What is she, 13? 
 Fourteen? 
 They know. 
 They pretend they don't, but they do. 
 Hannah Montana? 
 Those oversexed kids on  Glee? 
 Think they're selling good, wholesome, all-American fun? 
 Hell, no! 
 Flesh and underage temptation. 
 You can look, but, oh, no, don't touch. 
 f*ck off, Frank. 
 We see firm young bodies, every synapse in our cerebellum screams, "procreate, impregnate!" 
 It's not our fault. 
 We're driven by the deep, invaluable, evolutionary need to perpetuate the species. 
 My brother Bennie's girl... 15. 
 Running around his house in short shorts, lace bra, underwear hanging out. 
 I banged Filipino hookers in the Navy looked more innocent than my niece. 
 All right, you two sick f*cks are cut off. 
 Willpower, my friend! 
 Willpower! 
 We are warriors battling against the dark forces of our primal nature. 
 Knights taking up arms against our animalistic impulses in a debauched culture. 
 Doing battle every day, gentlemen. 
 Every single day! 
 Season tickets? 
 Just for the year. 
 Playoffs, too? 
 Jesus. 
 This Fiona better be the best pussy you ever had. 
 She's the only pussy I ever had. 
 Check out this idiot. 
 You stupid or just hard of hearing? 
 Ian and Lip are in jail. 
 I thought I told you to leave town. 
 They were driving a car that I stole. 
 Yeah, yeah, I know. They told you? 
 No, of course not; they're South Side. 
 You got to get them off. 
 Yeah, and why's that? 
 'Cause they're innocent. 
 They didn't know they were driving a stolen car? 
 I'll give you the house. 
 What? 
 The house that I bought beside Fiona's. 
 I'll give you the title; it's paid for. 
 You get the charges dropped, it's yours. 
 You paid for a house in cash? 
 It's a shitty neighborhood; I could have bought two. 
 How many cars have you stolen? 
 Do we have a deal or not? 
 Nothing else is changed; you're gone. 
 You don't see her, don't call, don't write. 
 Disappear. 
 I'm gone tonight. 
 What the hell was that? 
 I think I may have just found a way to move out of my mom's basement. 
 Good job, good job.

 CARL: You figured out what you're going to do to them yet? 
 Huh? Punishment. 
 Ground them for a year? 
 Nothing. I'm not their mother. 
 So I can steal a car and nothing will happen to me? 
 You steal a car and I'll smother you in your sleep.

 Wait, wait, wait.

 Because I don't love you.

 How's your hand? 
 It's broken, I think. 
 Where'd you get the car? 
 What? 
 The one you wrecked trying to kill your dad. 
 I stole it. 
 You're getting pretty good at that, huh? 
 Quick study. 
 I'm sorry, Lip. 
 f*cking fathers, huh?

 (pebble clacks on window) 
 Lip! I'm sorry! 
 Okay? I'm a sh1t. 
 No, I am. 
 A complete asshole. I know it. 
 If your grandmother was here, she'd say it, too. 
 It's totally my fault. 
 We all do things.

 These things show up, and you know you shouldn't, but then you do, and then you don't know what to do. 
 But we can't hold it against her. 
 She's young and carefree. 
 I mean, we're both victims here, you and me. 
 The Bible says it is blessed to forgive, son. 
 And that forgiveness is the first step... on the stairway to heaven. 
 (sighs) 
 We're both f*cking victims! 
 Open the window, son. 
 How can I ever really say I'm sorry? 
 sh1t. 
 What the f*ck?! 
 (muttering): Fair enough.
