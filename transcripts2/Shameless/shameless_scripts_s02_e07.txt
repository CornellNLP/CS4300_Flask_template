 For those of you who were too f*cking busy, this is what happened last week on  Shameless: 
 Hey, you filthy f*cking Portuguese. 
 Stan's losing his marbles. 
 What happened? I know you f*cked my sister! 
 You're right, he shouldn't be left alone up there. 
 Call his daughter. I'm gonna come down there and I'm gonna kick your ass! 
 He wants to stay in his apartment. 
 Where the hell've you been? Brazil. 
 We should get together, have lunch, just to catch up. 
 FIONA:  I'm seeing someone. STEVE: So am I. Bring him. A double date. 
 Estefania doesn't really speak English. 
 You're married? Ah,  si! 
 You married a drug lord's daughter, to hang onto your ear? 
 I missed you. 
 Hey! Okay. 
 Whoa. 
 DEBBIE:  Was it weird seeing Jimmy? 
 Who's Jimmy? Jimmy is Steve. V, they're gone. Ethel and Jonah. All their stuff is gone. His clothes, her suitcase, gone. f*ck you, Lip! I'll make West Point on my own. I don't need you. She's a married mother, publicly flaunting the geriatric she's sleeping with. JASMINE:  Come on, I need an accomplice. When I tell Hal we're going out for a girls' night, then I won't be lying. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm your grandmother, sweetheart. Grammy showed up. Grammy's back. Jesus... They let you out? Surprised to see you, Peg. Thought you were doing 20 to life. I will f*ck you up! Oh my God, there's a woman... sh1t. sh1t! ...with a gun. She's at a party, she's shooting people! Go ahead and pull it! Do it! Do it! ...and I'm gonna kick your ass. ♪ ♪

(shouting): We don't let people in the house before I wake up! Which guy doesn't like a finger up the butt? (laughing): What are you doing here? I came to invite you out in David's boat today. I thought you weren't allowed on the boat. Isn't it the wife's? Yeah, but they're in Indiana. Dropping one of the brats off at college. (phone alert) Steve's back in town. Not sure what to do about it. Bring him. Boat's got a Jacuzzi. Nah. Kids start school Tuesday. I got a lot to do to get ready. So, come for an hour! Everybody says that, but it never happens. I'll kick you out after an hour, then. Shouldn't you be getting your kids ready for school, too? Hal's on it. He loves doing that crap. So you'll come? I'll think about it. I gotta take a shower now, wash your slobber off me. You know, men pay lots of money for that slobber. Oh, yeah. Thanks for the visual. Mm. Go make yourself useful. I need coffee. You look like sh1t, Frank. You just getting in? Just got up. It's 7:00 a.m. Hurry up in there. I gotta help my mother out of bed and take her to the bathroom. Really putting a damper on your drink, puke, sleep schedule, huh? I can't take it anymore. Your problem. Not ours. (dog barking) What about this little guy? Hey, fella! KEVIN: Ah, I don't know, V. Oh, come on, he's so cute. How could anyone have abandoned him? And his tongue is almost as good as yours. A dog is not going to fill the hole in my heart. When you going to get over this, Kev? Doesn't it bother you that Ethel's gone? It bothers me we're not gonna get the money anymore. How could she just leave us like that? Because she's an ungrateful bitch. All right, stop. I'm serious. If she doesn't give a sh1t about us, why should we give a sh1t about her? She was family. Well, we have to move on. I liked having someone depending on me. Well, then pick out a stupid dog! Dogs are too much responsibility. A kid isn't? A cat, then. It's gonna piss everywhere. Well... we're not leaving here without something. Fine. We'll get that. This baby's pushing on my bladder. Morning. Ah, Jesus. Not again. ("Kiss From a Rose" by Seal begins) Knowing you were peeing made me horny. You're a s*x addict. Knowing I have a cold sore makes you horny. ♪ I've been kissed by a rose... ♪ Look at me. (whimpers) Look at me, I'm about to come. Look at me. Oh, babe. Oh. Oh, baby. Oh, baby! (singing along): ♪ My power ♪ 
♪ My pleasure, my pain... ♪ (groans) ♪ To me you're like a growing addiction ♪ 
♪ That I can't deny ♪ 
♪ Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby? ♪ (sniffs) (sighs) (sniffling) Why do you always do that? What? Cry? (choked up): It's a release. It's weird. I can't help it. I just feel so close to you. It's like I'm giving you all my hurt and joy to hold and protect. (choking back sobs) So gay. Be nice to have a little Jean Nate in the water. I'll get some tomorrow. And stop breathing all over me. I want to go to Indian Bingo today. Feeling lucky. Can't. Got a big day planned. Where? At the Alibi? We can go after you take me to Indian Bingo. Was thinking... we should look for a new place for you to live today. Why the hell would I want to do that? Be a lot more comfortable. Walk-in tub. One of those chair-stair things. A ramp on the front porch. You'd be a lot more independent. Don't need it; I have you. Well, I can't always be here. Got a full-time job, six kids to raise. Are we talking about the same person? Scrub harder. You're scrubbing like a pussy. Disturbing image. Morning, Lip. How's it going, Grams? (unzips fly, urinates) You f*ck girls with that pecker? As often as they let me. Hard to believe he got Karen pregnant with that thing. (chuckling) It's so small, isn't it? Don't kiss up to me because you feel like a worthless piece of sh1t. (zips fly) Missed a spot, Frank. (toilet flushes) Ass f*ck. Jack off. You guys still not talking? (thud, gasps) Dude?! Carl?! What the f*ck? Holy crap, why have I never done that before? You have too much time on your hands. Summer school next year. How's your head? Little dizzy. You're fine. Go have some breakfast. LIP: How much we looking at in the winter-squirrel fund? Just over nine grand. That's all we made to get us through the entire winter? Frank screwed us when he gave Liam away. And there was that new compressor for the fridge. And that stuff for Liam's ear infection, mwah! Everyone needs to get winter jobs. Debs, get down here. Breakfast. DEBBIE: I'll be right there. I'll use the downstairs toilet. School supplies and clothing, nothing else. No candy, drugs, beer, or concert tickets. And I want receipts. What if the drugs are really good? You're still here? I got caught up reading a magazine. Hey, that's mine. Debs, I need you to find the backpacks and any old school books. Carl, put the day care supplies back in the basement. DEBBIE: Okay. Roger that. Lip, you and Ian clean out the pool. I think there's a few surprises in there for you. Carl, tell Lip to do it himself. Lip, Ian says you can do it yourself. Carl, tell Ian he's being a douchebag for still not talking to me. Ian, Lip says you're being a... Okay, whatever it is that you guys are still doing, I want it over before school starts. So figure it out. Mommy, what's my assignment? Uh, go home to your family. Actually, I need to go get the boat ready. Belmont Harbor. Slip 22. 2:00. I said I'll think about it. Uh-huh. FRANK: I'm gonna see what Fiona's cooking for breakfast. Rooster in the henhouse. Rooster in the henhouse. Hide the money! Morning, Gram. Morning, Gram. Morning, Grams. Bye, Gram. Bye, Grammy! Your grandmother thinks you're being selfish by not spending more time with her. Why don't you two hang out? Have girl time. I'm gonna go. GRAMMY: Frank, give me two three-minute eggs, dry toast, and a cup of Maxwell House before we go to Indian Bingo. Have fun, you guys. (mutters) Only one cup. Huh? That's your second cup. So? So the baby book says caffeine's not good for the fetus. Well, it's good for me. Hey, you want our baby to come out healthy? You okay? Yeah. Sure? Yes, stop asking me. (mutters): I'm fine. (knocking) They're here. Door's open. Who's here? My friends from tattoo school, I told you. (children laugh) JODY: Come in, come in. They're gonna give us some info about natural childbirth. (woman laughing) Hey, you guys! MAN: Look at this man, hey, m*therf*cker! Yeah, looking good, looking good. Just f*cking sits there. Should we take her out of the cage? Probably needs to acclimate. Let's call her Ethel Number Two. What did we do wrong, V? We didn't do anything wrong, Kev. I just feel like we should be out there looking for her or something. Social services says they're on it. Oh, please. Social services; you think they have any time to go look for her? You heard that woman. 85% of foster kids run away. Well, there's nothing we can do. Maybe she didn't like living here. You just said 85% of foster kids run away. What makes you think we're in the top 15% of households? How can you be so cold about this? 'Cause she hurt my Kev. And no one hurts my Kev. Come here. Mmmmm. Mmmm, my baby's getting his mojo back. It was never gone, just on hold. Oh, sh1t. What? One of her weird underwear things, so what? I-I'm not in the mood anymore. What? Well, where are you going? The Alibi Room. We can do Lady and the Tramp, if you want. You know, I'm sorry if it's gonna take me longer to get over losing our child than you, V. Please don't go out in public with that shirt. (knocking) Hey! I didn't text you back for a reason. I wanna explain. Don't. I got everything I need, Jimmy. I'm still Fiona, by the way. Fiona, Fiona. When I found out that you were married, I was hurt. But then when you had a whole other life, man, I realized I dodged a bullet. I was trying to explain at the restaurant. Not necessary. We're totally cool. Everything's great, Jimmy-Steve. I'll be seeing you around. (mutters) JODY: These powdered donuts are fantastic! LISA: I got them at Costco. HELEN: Case was only five dollars. We were there to get a Vizio flat screen. 200 bucks later, no Vizio, just a cart full of groceries. HELEN: Which we needed more than a TV. It's hard to watch the game on a baked ham, hon. You guys can use our membership card anytime you want. Great. Lots of stuff we need around the house, huh, babe? I guess. You know what you and I should do, Karen? Can you pass the Pop-Tarts, honey? We should go in on a couple of cases of diapers together. Huh? Since our babies will probably be born around the same time. You're pregnant? Why do you think I'm eating so much? You could save a bundle on your hospital bills if you just have the baby at home. You have a tub? Yeah, upstairs. Besides, if you deliver at the hospital, you run the risk of them slicing you like a turkey. What? LISA: Yeah, it's true. Victor here-- come here, baby-- he was nine pounds. His little elbow was stuck behind my pelvis. Doctors had to give me an episiotomy. What's that? It's where they cut you open from v*g1n* to anus. You don't feel a thing. It's good drugs. TOM: I've got the video. Honey, she doesn't wanna see that. Nobody wants to see. I'm telling you, just have the baby in the tub upstairs. It'll squirt right out. My lady business hasn't been the same since the episiotomy. I swear I could fit a walrus up there. It's not that bad. Then why did you wrap your pen1s in toilet paper before putting the condom on the other night? TOM: You saw that? I've been pulling pieces of tissue out of me all week. Hey, Karen, you okay? Guess who the big winner was in Indian Bingo. (all cheer) That a girl, Peggy! Did you cheat? Of course. "How" about you, Frank? You win anything? Come on, Mom, let me play. Did you bring any cash? No... Then no Bingo for you. f*ck you, Tommy. (laughs) Hey, Kev. Hey, guys. What can I get you? Couple of Old Styles with whiskey backs and a round for everyone on me. (all cheer) Except for Jinny. I haven't forgotten you f*cked my husband, you miserable excuse for a v*g1n*. (patrons laughing) Hey, Kermit. Frank. Was wondering, your sister still has MS, right? Yeah, it kinda doesn't go away. So your house is tricked out with all that handicapped crap then? Handrails, shower bench, Rascal scooter. How would you feel about taking in my mother? She could pay rent. No. It's just that I'm getting really busy. I'm not taking care of your mother, Frank. When he was ten, our family cat was in heat. And he thought that meant we should open the windows. (hearty laughter) Fire in the hole. Jasmine invited me out to David's boat today. I never been on a boat. Said it has gold-plated bathroom fixtures. You going? I don't know if I have time. It's the end of summer. Before you know it, you'll be back to mittens and multiplication tables again. Maybe. I'm coming down. It'll be a nice distraction for Kev. He's driving me crazy. He's still upset? It's not like Ethel was our real kid. She was our job. FRANK: I'm getting them now! GRAMMY: Bring down the Jergens. I need you to massage my feet. Fiona? Hmm? We have to get rid of your grandmother. What? Where are the toenail clippers? I didn't wanna have to say this, but she's not happy here. Put 'em back when you're done. These are never gonna cut through her crusty talons. How could she not be happy? She just moved in a week ago. Ah, he's full of sh1t. He just doesn't wanna deal with her. That's not true. I love having her here. I wish I could spend all my waking hours with her. Do we have any bolt cutters? Good, because she's staying. The kids like having her around. It's not their house. Do they pay rent? She buys 'em things. And she likes good food that she pays for. You should've been here two nights ago. We had porterhouse. You're invited and I'm not? GRAMMY: And I need some more chocolate Ensure. Fiona, she's gone, with or without your help. (sportscast playing) What do you make of these, Kermit? Three of the most boring states of our country. My foster daughter ran away. Been sending me these. I'm trying to figure out a clue where she might be going or why she left. "Having a nice time in Kansas. Ethel." What does it mean? If I had to guess, I'd say she's having a nice time in Kansas. Or she's being held at gunpoint. Forced to write that. Great, Tommy. Like I'm not worried enough, already. I'm just saying you should get these postcards DNA tested. See if there's any other fingerprints on them. That's not gonna prove anything. You know how many people have touched this postcard before it got here? Then throw a blue light on it. Check to see if there's any blood or sweat on it. Or semen. That'll tell you a lot. Could be right. Many foster kids become prostitutes. Jesus! Give me those! There's no semen on them, and my kid's not a prostitute. Social services is on it. Yeah, like they're on my sister's welfare checks that keep getting stolen out of her mailbox? STAN: I got to go to my game. I'll see you guys later, okay? (chuckles) Stan, Stan, what the f*ck are you doing? TOMMY: Holy sh1t! Look at the hog on Stan! Got a baseball game. What do you think? I've heard rumors about that thing. Go back to your apartment, please. Oh, get your hands off me, you knucklehead. You're gonna make me late for my game. You don't have a baseball game. Yes, I do-- it's at Archer Field. I saw it today on my calendar. Oh, yeah, your calendar from 1984? Come on, let's go back upstairs. Well, who's gonna play first base? You know, I just got a call. They canceled the game. Oh, geez! I had a lot of money on it, too. Damn it! Damn it! KERMIT: Come on, Kevin. It's time to call Stan's daughter. Put him in a home. Shut the f*ck up, Kermit. Stan's not going anywhere. And Ethel is not a prostitute. I'm surprised you called. I need you to do something for me. What? (whispers): Get rid of Jody. Kill him? No. Just make him go away. Everything he does is bugging me. Get a divorce. Can't. He'll take half of the money from my dad's life insurance. Oh, you didn't get that yet? No, they said another couple of months. The police are still investigating. Oh, yeah? But when I do finally get it, though, I'm gonna open a tanning salon. Or buy a convertible. Or get a boob job. I should've done a prenup. Well, it's not too late. Aren't you supposed to get that  before  you get married? Yeah, if you want to do things the traditional way. Look, we can print one up online. I know a guy; he's a notary. He'll predate it for a couple hundred bucks. Really? All you got to do is get Jody to sign it. (laughs) That'll be easy-- he's an idiot. You said it, not me. NARRATOR (on TV): ... and the detectives working with him decided the time had come to pick up the suspected murderer... You're in my way. What's wrong with the TV? Nothing. This show's in black and white. You're still in my way. Looks old. So do I. Now, move. DEBBIE: Here, Carl. I found these old readers you can use. (dramatic music plays on TV) Little old for third grade, aren't you? It's my second time. Not too smart, huh? Anything you're good at? How about let's teach you a skill? MAN (on TV): Okay, we'll have to do the best we can. (dance music playing nearby) I'm not promising I'm having any fun today, ladies. Here it is. Wow. Thought she was only having a few people over. (dance music continues) Why don't we party like this? 'Cause you keep forgetting to buy us a boat. Oh, that's right. (chuckles) ♪ ♪ JASMINE: Fiona! Hey! Hi! Come on board! Grab some champagne.

Make-Make it two. I never thought I'd say this, but you were right. We have to get rid of her. JODY: Hey, Lip. Jody. How's it going, man? What, uh... what are you doing? Karen kicked me out. So you're, uh... sleeping under the El? Talked to my friend Lisa, and she said this is what happens to women when they're pregnant. It's hormones. You sure about that? As soon as Karen's hormones calm down, I'll be back in the house. No, you won't, weirdo! I'll see you. ♪ ♪

Can't we just call the police, the FBI, tell them about the meth lab? They'd haul us away. Not me-- I had nothing to do with it. Happened in our house-- you're an accomplice. And there are minors involved. Yo, Kev, something's leaking. Come on. KEVIN: Aw, sh1t, not again! What the f*ck?! f*ckin' Stan. What if she happens to commit another crime away from the house? You mean like... we set her up? I don't know, I hadn't fleshed it out. Yeah, I guess that's what I mean. Finally thinking like a Gallagher. She's putting our lives in danger. We could have the cops... pick her up, tell them it's a Chapter 405. A mental disorder? They'd take her away. Involuntary psychiatric hold. Just like that? No questions asked. (laughing) That'll work. That'll work. Stan! You leave the tub running again? Goddamn it. Ow! f*ck! Cock, cock, cock, cock, cock. Goddamn it. (water running) Stan? No, no... No, no, no, Stan? Stan? (both scream) What the hell are you doing? Jesus Christ! You stupid old sh1t, you scared the hell out of me! What? What? I thought you were dead. No, no, I'm just taking a bath. Well, why was it overflowing? Well, the water got cold, so I was adding some hot water. I guess I fell asleep. Stan, you can't keep doing that, or you won't be able to live on your own anymore. Please, I'm fine, I'm fine. Oh, yeah? Well, you left the stove on, too. Yeah, I know that. I did it on purpose. Now, get the hell out of here. Get out. You're lucky I don't drown you. Ah, get out. Geez... Okay, so we'll clean up the meth lab, air the place out, and then call the cops. They'll bring her to a geriatric psych ward, Hold her 72 hours, do an evaluation. What if they find her normal? Aw, get the f... Okay, you're right. When she doesn't pass, they'll hold her for another 14 days and test her again. Why didn't we think of this sooner? I warned you about this yesterday. But do you listen to me? No, you don't. sh1t, Carl. We could've avoided every... What's going on? What happened? I'm fine. Don't listen to them. Are you the guardians of Margaret Gallagher? She is. She's my grandmother. What happened? Well, your grandmother blacked out. She was at an Ace Hardware, fell, Was taken to the emergency room. What was it? E.R. doc says cancer. Stage four pancreatic. Doesn't have long to live. Thank you, Lord. Grammy. Hey, it smells in here. You blow up our lab? A little bit. Oh, come here. We'll get it right next time. She's got to be in a lot of pain. Shouldn't be leaving the house. These morons don't know what they're talking about. Sign this form, please. If she were my grandmother, I'd call hospice. They can manage her pain, make her more comfortable. Hey, knucklehead, set up the card table. I want to teach Carl a little five card stud.

No, it isn't. I was... I was cold to her when she first got here. Yeah, but you warmed up real quick. 'Cause I loved her. She knew that. (sniffles) Then why did she leave us? (sighs) I wish I knew.

I've just been staying on David's boat, although he didn't know about it until the cops showed up last night. You've been breaking in to his boat? He never uses it; it's just sitting there. I gave him the best blow jobs of his life. You saw him. I was so out of his league. I got to get in the shower. Start looking for a job. Hey, do you think I could stay here for a couple of days? What? Yeah, I'll kick in some rent money. No. No? But I do everything for you. What are you talking about? I brought Steve to the party, I gave you a job this winter.
