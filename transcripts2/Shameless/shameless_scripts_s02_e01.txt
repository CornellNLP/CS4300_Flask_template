 Jesus, you really don't remember what happened last year? 
 Pay some f*cking attention this time. 
 Steve:  Your life's not simple, Fiona, and you're nothing like anyone I've ever met. 
 You make me want to enjoy my life again. Steve: Who the hell is that? My dad. In my whole career, I've never seen such a spectacular display  of alcoholism. Thank you. Fiona: How much are we short? Debbie: $18.30. Lip:  I'm take the PSATS for some Polish kid. Are you able to kick in, like, ten more? I get paid Friday. Okay, I'll figure out the rest. Steve:  I can loan you the money. We don't need your charity. "Fiona, thanks for a night I'll never forget." Who the f*ck's Tony? Tony:  I've waited a long time  for last night to happen. At least Tony's not coming here getting all in my family's business what the f*ck is wrong, Frank?! Maybe that's what I want. You know nothing about me. Then teach me! I'm gay. I know. That's for screwing my husband. Linda:  I want another baby. What? I get what I want, and you can have what you want. Kash: Put the candy back, now. f*ck! sh1t! I like you, Fiona. You're a dirty girl, like me. Jasmine, this is Veronica. V lives next door. Hiya, V. Veronica:  We're only taking in a foster kid for a week  to get the money to pay for my stupid parking tickets. Kevin:  Want to go over to the park,  throw the ol' pigskin around? Would it be all right if my son Jonah came? Huh? This is the robotics lab. It is the best in the country. Come by anytime. Karen: Science just turns me on. Eddie: What are you hiding? I left them. Lip:  Your house is Frank's wet dream. Never gonna get him out. Dad. Son. Karen:  What are we? Lip:  Friends. Just friends? Friends who like to do this. I knew that. Eddie: It says here you can re-dedicate yourself as a virgin. Oral s*x, orgy, big black strap-on dildo. You whore! Karen:  He humiliated me! Get out! Don't ever come back! You're out of the house. I'm out of the house! Whoa! What do you think now, daddy? Am I still a whore? Frank? Frank?! I think I was kind of falling in love with her. Tony: How long you been stealing cars? Who says I steal them? (Tires screech) I have to leave town. Come with me. Costa Rica, it's beautiful. Fiona:  I think I might be in love with him. Veronica:  Scary, isn't it? Steve:  I love you.  I want to be with you. Come with me. ♪ think of all the luck you got ♪

Hear all those heart-warming, scumbag freeloading Frank stories. (Motorcycle approaching) Who the hell is that? Friend from group. Group? s*x addicts anonymous. Gig's almost up, daddy Frank. Time to make other plans. One hundred! (Indistinct radio transmission) (Squealing happily) Hey, cut it off, Ernie. Thanks, lieutenant. Hey, do you mind if we drop Cami off early tomorrow? Teresa's got inventory at Costco. No problem. And tell Teresa thanks for the case of dented soup. Bye-bye, Cami. Mwah. Pool's open! (Kids shouting happily) (Chatting and laughing) Eddie goes to the corner for a pack of Lucky's, never heard from again. Goddamn city couldn't wait to stop paying him. Wasn't two weeks before the checks stopped coming. And now what are we supposed to live off of? Sheila's single disability check? How does Mr. Osama-Obama expect us to survive on that? Man: He gonna try and tase me. I hit him. If Sheila does go to work, what's she going to make? Minimum wage... at best. Nobody's heard from Eddie? He tases me... Not a word. Man's got no sense of responsibility. Leaving a family of three to fend for ourselves. Man: I got tased twice, man. Bullshit. What you say? Uh... I said bullshit! I got tasered for like a second, I crapped myself. There's no way you got tasered twice, fought off three cops ran away. (Blows raspberries) You calling me a liar? At the very least, an exaggerator. A grand says I did. Kev, you still got that taser back there? I'll see your grand and add nine more. 10,000 in American legal tender says you can not get tasered twice and not soil your tighty whities, much less keep standing. All right, shithead. (Laughing) Move. (Hoots) (Laughing) Do it. (Frank laughing) Do it! (Electrical crackling, man grunting) Again! (Electrical crackling, man grunting) What?! Where's my ten grand, m*therf*cker? (Loud music playing) Hey, gorgeous, more Diablos. Oh, you think these boy scouts can handle that kind of heat, girls? No. No, not a chance. Not a chance. (Laughing) Six more Diablos, a JB back, Ketel One up with a lime wedge, Maker's Seven, and four Stellas. Haven't given up on that one yet? Fiona: Every summer needs a challenge. Man's in love with his own fabulous self. Probably masturbates while he licks his reflection in the mirror. Jasmine: Fiona! Who's that, slutty's husband? Uh, no. Hal's rounder. Hi. Hi. Fi, this is my friend, David. Jasmine's told me a lot about you. Only that you're fabulous, smart, and unbelievably sexy. And that you're home for the summer from Princeton. I'll get us a table. Okay. Princeton? We're going out later. You want to come? What about Hal? Annual Michigan fishing trip with the softball buddies. Mosquitos, bratwurst and gallons of Budweiser. Sounds pretty brokeback to me. Come later, live a little. That a regular thing? First time I've seen him. She probably did his taxes, then did him. ♪ ♪ (Cheering) Kick him back, you're punching like a fag. (Clanging) Man: First round. Go to your corners. You know you're supposed to hit him back, right? f*ck, that kid hits hard. What did you think this was going to be? I didn't think he could punch me with a foot. You see that? He kicked me in the top of my goddam head. Listen, look at me. You want to throw in the towel? Man: Round two (Clanging) I would if I was smart. (Cheering) ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

♪ turn it up on a Friday, bump it all night long... ♪ He's crazy about you. Long Island, two Landsharks, three Mojitos, Margarita no salt, Chivas Neat and a Jack Rocks. All the woman needs is a pole. Why don't you come out with us later. Kev won't mind. I can't. I got a shift at the nursing home in the morning. This better be somebody who's about to give me a gigantic tip. God, I'm so sorry. I thought your ass was my drink. Veronica: Hey, Justin Bieber. How's things at Goldman Sachs? Going well enough for me to afford getting ripped off coming here. And it's JP Morgan. Oh, whatever. All you mortgage-raping sh1ts should be in prison anyway. Yeah, well, I was in grad school during the mortgage crisis. Nowadays, we're trying to short Euros so Greece will go bankrupt. Are we on for later? I haven't decided if I still like you. Later, mama bear. Hey, junior, school night. In bed with the lights out by 10:00. What? Order's up. (Laughter) (Whooping) ♪ Turn it up on a Friday, bump it all night long ♪ 
♪ I-I-I'm gonna party when you play my song. ♪ How the hell did that little guy kick Kurt-fucking-Landis' ass? We make anything on my fight? Thanks, Rasmik! Nah, nobody wanted the odds. What'd you put down? On the fight you lost? Nada. Fraternal loyalty doesn't extend to stupidity, bud. So, Mickey's out soon, yeah? In about a week or so if he doesn't stab anybody else. Plastic fork-- Barely broke the kid's skin, but it bought him another 30 days. You got to be looking forward to having Mickey home again, huh? I guess. Hey, I want to stage another fight night next week. Go around to the Dojos, round up some more scrappers, all right? Sure. Where you going? Karen's. Thought you gave up on that. See ya. Yeah. Karen Jackson? After that thing with your dad? I'm sneaking antibiotics into his toothpaste, just in case. (Vehicle approaching, tires screech) (Thumping hip-hop music playing) Baby: Tomorrow fuckhead! (Vehicle accelerates, tires screech) Jesus Christ! f*ck! Friend dropped me off. Right. What the hell you doing here? Came to see Karen. She went with a guy to her group. What group? s*x addicts anonymous. Well, can I come in and wait? No. (Train passing) (Panting, moaning) (Gasping) (Both panting) (Laughs) Looks like old man Dave is beating your time, Romeo. Yeah, well, I'm working without pharmaceutical assistance. He was popping little blue pills-- I counted four. Four, wow. We could be here awhile. Ah, f*ck! I told my boss I'd meet him for a run in about an hour. I could run with you. I ran track in high school. (Laughs) What? Don't look so surprised. I ran distance. There was a chance I was gonna make state. Yeah? What happened? Life. Come on. I'm fast. Oh, really? I could beat your ass. You're on. Wait! (Shrieks) Okay, ready? Give it to you. (Laughs) Okay. All right. On your mark... Yeah. Get set... Okay. Go! (Laughs) What are you doing? Are you a valet now? See you tonight? Maybe. Maybe? (Tires screech) Hey, Fiona. Tony. How's work? It's good. How's your remodel coming? You really want to know or just being neighborly? Neighborly. Cast iron plumbing's out, replacing it with copper. Guy on my shift moonlights as an electrician, so he's going to help me rewire. You gonna flip it or live in it? Waiting to see what happens. I got to get the kids going. (Sighs) Whoa. What happened to you? One of my fighters pussied-out on me, I had to fill in. Looks like the pussy had the right idea. Get some ice on that eye. Good morning. We're out of mac and cheese. I can make PB&Js instead, but I'm gonna need more bread. How many signed up for today? Nine. Romano twins, Cami, Mangis, that Ulin kid with the big head. Whoa, half a cup. I'm exhausted. Liam had me up half the night banging his head. I need my own room. And I want a pony for Christmas. He's a boy, he should be in with the boys. No way, there's three of us in that room. I'm a girl. I'm going to be a woman soon. I need privacy to undergo the upcoming traumatic transformation. It's not that traumatic. How would you know? Video in fifth grade. What are we talking about? Moving Liam into our room. No f*cking way. (Knocking) First day care kid is here. My own room? It's not gonna happen, Debs. Go, go. (Knocking) "Traumatic Transformation"? Wow. Ethel, the garden looks great. It's all in the compost. My red worms have been working overtime this year. None of God's bounty ever needs go to waste. (Grunts) Still on for today? Think it still runs? Probably not, but you can fix anything. Hey, what are those huge round green things in the back? Tomatoes. Ah. She's a keeper. Kevin: Mmm. ♪ Climb every mountain ♪

(Laughs) I had mom move her rainy day fund after what happened last time. Sheila: Karen, the omelets are ready! I had nothing to do with that. Hello?! I hid her ATM card, too, so don't even try taking that again. (Kids clamoring) Her nose has been running, but I think it's just the glue that Jeff's been using on the new kitchen linoleum. Bye, baby. Oh, and please, no gluten. Gluten? Who knows. Ooh. Hey, there you go. There's Cinderella. Uh, you all set? Yeah. Playtime, one hour. Tv or  Bambi-- Skip the dead mom part. Arts and crafts.

I got to get upstairs. The twins are going to be late for swim team at the mosque. And no free breakfast. You come to work hungry, you pay like everybody else. (Bells jingle) Linda gone? Mm-hmm. Been waiting across the street for an hour. Mm. Late night? What do you care? Linda: Where the hell have you been? Kash! I waited up until after midnight. You know the doctor wants me in bed by... (Turns off monitor) What are you looking at? Go microwave me a burrito and stock the cooler. A pack of Marlboros? (Kevin laughs) What?! Hey, you try starting this thing since last summer? No. Hey, how's the crop coming? It's almost harvesttime. But I'm a bit worried though. It seems like there's a lot more cops in the park this summer. Yeah, I'm working on it. Oh.

See any exposed bone? (Door closes) Stan's yelling again, so loud you can hear him through the floor. Oh, yesterday it was Nixon and Jimmy Carter. What's it today? I turned the tv up after "f*cking colored people." (Groans) He keeps going downhill like this, you're going to have to call Becky. He has his good and bad days. Bad days? That's what you call trying to take out the trash naked? He forgot his pants-- it happens, all right? I know you love the old racist b*st*rd, but if it were my dad, I'd want to know he was going south. It's probably time for her to think about putting him in a home. I can't hear you. No. N-no, I don't want to watch my language. I've been speaking this language for the last 50 goddamn years. No, you listen to me, you f*cking daughter of a chink whore. Hello? Goddamn c**t, c**t, c**t. She hung up on me. The bitch didn't speak one word of English. She's probably in the basement of some whorehouse in Calcutta. A-and would you believe this sh1t? What sh1t? My electric bill. $8,700 bucks for electricity. You know, I've been running this bar for 40 years and I never got a bill that was even close to a grand. All I want is for them to send me one of their taco-eating, wetback meter readers to come here and check out the f*cking thing! Nah, that's it, get me my shotgun. I'm going to go down there and blow the c**t's head off. Can I see it-- The bill? Yeah, here. They must have made some mistake. The only mistake they made was f*cking with me. All right, Stan, would you please sit down? Aah! Stan, sit down before you blow another ventricle. Yeah, blow, blow. I'm gonna take care of this, all right?

You know how she told you about that kick-ass worm sh1t she's been using on her tomatoes? Yeah. Well, it worked so good, we decided to use it on this year's crop. You know how I usually grow a couple plants to get us through the summer? Holy sh1t. Exactly. Wait, so what's the problem? Forgot about the electric bill. We need nine grand or they're gonna shut the power off to the building. Isn't it wonderful? Mr. Kevin is going to help all the old people who are going blind. God bless you. Jesus loves you. (Heavy metal playing) f*ck you, Frank. (Hip-hop playing) Jesus-- Oh, sh1t. Baby: Where's my money? Okay, okay, okay, stop! (Tires screeching, horn honking) (Clears throat) Back to work. Your fly is down. So how much do you think you've got growing down here? I don't know, a couple hundred pounds or so. I'm gonna start drying what I can, but that won't fetch more than a couple grand or so by Friday. Well, you know what? Maybe we could, uh, unload some of the plants? Yeah, how much would we have to sell? Five maybe, six? Lip, who the hell around here has two grand for a plant? I might know a guy. V's going to kill me. She's going to f*cking kill me. I promised her that I wouldn't sell more than three or four this year. Normally I throw a bunch of seeds around, see which looks best, thin out the rest, but this year I couldn't. They're all so beautiful, I just... I just couldn't do it. Where's my f*cking money? That was great last night. You were having fun, I was having fun. Where's my f*cking money? You were serious about that? Get me the goddamn tin snips. I-if, if I had won, I wouldn't expect you to pay me. Take off his shoes. But... It's a turn of phrase, like, uh, uh, "I bet it's going to rain today." Yeah, let me tell you something, if I don't get my f*cking money, I'm cutting toes off and cauterizing 'em with a blowtorch. You got my panhandling cash. 60 bucks, man?! I was only out there for 45 minutes! We'll keep the kid. Yeah, as collateral. Come back with my f*cking money, you get the kid. I-I-I'll bring you your money, but you can't keep the kid. You can't keep Liam. I'll get you your money-- We can work this out. Oh, we just did. No, no, no, no, no, absolutely you can't... (Grunts) Light it up, get him up. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Keep Liam. Get up out of here. (Liam crying) I'll be back, buddy, I promise you.

Hey, you got my SIM board? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Hey, any interest in purchasing a six-foot-tall pot plant? Chicks love an old dude with great weed. Yeah, how much? Uh, a couple grand. Pricey. It's primo stuff. What the hell is that anyway? It's a cop locator. Rigging up a GPS system that uses police frequencies for coordinates. Shows me where all the cops are in a given area at any given time. Is that even legal? What, trying to make sure our community is receiving its fair share of law enforcement resources? Why not? Listen, I-I got a lunch date, I got to go. Oh, with who, David Petraeus? No, I landed a department of defense grant. Micro-robotics surveillance drone prototypes. Yeah?

We got to talking about music yesterday, and he showed me a bunch of bands I've never heard of. My favorite was called Guns N' Roses. Guns N' Roses? How old is Jody? Uh, 37, I think. You know, he laid out a blanket in the park, and we listened to his iPod, and fell asleep in each others' arms. Wow. s*x any good? No s*x. It's a part of this whole s*x Addicts Anonymous thing. Right, but you're a teenager. I mean, all teenagers are s*x addicts. Yeah, but I've been having s*x since I was 11. I don't know. Jody and I don't want the physical to complicate things for us. Yeah, but we can still get, uh, complicated, right? Sure, I guess. (Alarm sounds) Oh, sh1t. Uh, foot patrol, nine o'clock. 200 yards and closing. Never heard of Guns N' Roses?
