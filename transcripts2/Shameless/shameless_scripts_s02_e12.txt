 This is what you missed last week on  Shameless. 
 My baby! 
 (squeals) 
 True love. 
 Hey, hot stuff. 
 What do you do? Real estate. I live in Miami. 
 (growling) 
 I kicked Lip out. Where'd he go? 
 Is it all right if I stay over tonight? 
 Was it weird seeing Jimmy? Who's Jimmy? 
 Jimmy is Steve. 
 Holy sh1t. I'm gonna see the little guy on Friday? 
 Yep. For, like, a second. 
 Christ almighty! This cocksucker's killing me! 
 When they're good, they're good. 
 You're the only one who truly understands me. 
 Is something wrong with her? She hasn't gotten out of bed in days. 
 IAN:  Monica's bipolar, Debs. 
 Time for you to go back on your meds, huh? 
 Holy f*ck. CARL: What happened? 
 Mommy, Mommy... Oh, God, there's been an accident. 
 She's bleeding badly. They're on their way. You with me? 
 It's gonna be okay. We're good, we're good. Stay with me. 
 How is she? She's stable. 
 DOCTOR: You should go home. 
 Lip just called. He's coming? 
 Karen's having a baby upstairs. Holy f*ck! 
 It's coming, it's coming! 
 (screaming) 
 What's wrong with him? 
 He's has Downs Syndrome, Debs. What the f*ck, Karen? 
 I never said it was your baby. 
 SHEILA:  I got the baby, I got the baby! 
 JODY:  Come on, come on! 
 SHEILA: Whoo-hoo-hoo! 
 Whoo! I've got a baby!

 Hey!

 You stole my wife, and I want her back. 
 Okay, visiting hours are 9:00 to 4:00. 
 You want to see her, come back then. 
 Come out, Monica! Hey!

 (gasps) 
 Oh, look. 
 He's still got his little dingy-ding skin. 
 Should we get him circumcised? 
 Hell, no. Let that extra derma ride. 
 Oh, he needs a name. 
 What about Hiram, for my father? 
 Are you a Hymmie? 
 Hmm. Think they can track this thing, like a baby LoJack? 
 Are you a little Hymmie? 
 A Hymmie-wymie? The name should be something Chinese. 
 Keep him connected to his people. Hmm. 
 Chinese... 
 Chen, Chan, Chang... 
 (baby coos) 
 Wing? Wang? 
 Wu? Hm... it's pretty tight. 
 I don't want to slip and cut his leg off. 
 Well, you could clip his ankle bracelet and his foreskin at the same time. 
 Hey, my friend Cindy went back to work. 
 Has to pump. For a five-spot, I bet she'd hook us up with some breast milk. 
 Oh... 
 (siren wails) 
 (siren fades into distance) 
 (sighs) 
 They're going to be looking for him. 
 We need to hide him. How about the attic? 
 Like that movie about the Hebrew girl. 
 No, it gets cold in the winter. What about the basement? 
 No, it's the first place they'll look, sweetie. 
 Dryer? 
 Just can't forget he's in there. 
 Right.

 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Somebody stole the baby. 
 They think it was my mom. 
 Jesus. 
 You call the police? 
 She probably just freaked out, like always. 
 I'm gonna get it back. 
 Well, maybe you should let your mom keep him for awhile. 
 You know, at least till you're sure you're not gonna change your mind. 
 I'm not gonna change my mind. 
 Yeah, but you don't know that. I mean, you could really... 
 I don't want that f*cking thing anywhere near me, okay? 
 Go ask somebody when I can get the hell out of here. 
 I want to hit Wendy's before they stop serving breakfast. 
 (silverware clinking, baby babbling in distance) 
 Morning. 
 (Liam babbles) 
 Kids still sleeping? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Turkey and eggs? 
 With mashed potato pancakes and cranberry jelly. Hmm. 
 You back to being a legal resident around here, Steve? 
 Jimmy. His name's Jimmy now. 
 Steve was just an alias he used to lie to me about who he really was. 
 Ooh, not cool, Jimmy-Steve. 
 Eggs? To go. 
 I changed my name 'cause I was stealing cars. Didn't want anyone to be able to track me down if things went south. 
 It didn't have anything to do with you. 
 Yeah. 
 I want to meet your family. 
 Oh, no, you don't. 
 Yes, I do. 
 They're miserable people. 
 Nasty, egomaniacal shit-heads. 
 All of them? Yeah, Mom's okay when she's knocked back enough Chardonnay. 
 How many of you are there? 
 Uh, Mom, Dad-- shit-head superstar. 
 Older brother Chip-- shit-head superstar-in-training. 
 Can't wait to meet them. 
 You're going to be disappointed. 
 Wouldn't be the first time someone's disappointed me. 
 Okay. 
 (door buzzes) 
 You look beautiful. 
 (scoffs softly) 
 (chuckles) 
 Liar. 
 So, you getting okay care here? 
 Good drugs? 
 You need anything? 
 Uh, cigarettes, shampoo, hacksaw? 
 Clothes. 
 Mine are a mess. 
 I'll bring by some stuff. 
 I really screwed up Thanksgiving. 
 No, it was no big deal. 
 The kids? 
 I must have scared the sh1t out of them. 
 They're good. 
 We, uh, talked it out last night, and I tucked them in, they're fine today. 
 You didn't tuck them in. 
 I read books to them, the little ones, anyway. 
 (chuckles) 
 You'll be out soon. 
 You'll see for yourself. 
 Not soon. 
 72 hours. 
 You already got 15 under your belt. 
 I signed myself in for 60 more days. 
 Voluntary commitment. 
 Well, tell them you changed your mind. 
 I can't. 
 That's part of the deal. 
 Frank, I got to get myself normal. 
 I can't keep doing this to them. 
 You're just a little blue. 
 It happens to everyone every now and again. 
 I can take care of you at home. 
 No, you can't. 
 I love you. 
 You belong with us. 
 I'm... 
 I'm where I need to be, okay? 
 I got to go. 
 (sobbing softly) 
 I got group. 
 (door closes) 
 (knocking) 
 Can I borrow a cup of cocaine? 
 All out. Coffee? 
 How are the little ones this morning? 
 After seeing their mother slit her wrists? 
 Traumatized. 
 Has to be support groups for kids who've seen sh1t like that. 
 Yeah, in maximum security prisons after they've mowed down half their classmates. 
 You let Steve spend the night? 
 You mean Jimmy? 
 f*ck that, I'm calling him Steve. 
 I sent him out on a quest. 
 Mm! Making him re-win the heart of the virgin? 
 (babbling) 
 Christ, V, I can't let him back into this madness. 
 Isn't that his choice? 
 Well, he thinks he wants it now, but just wait a year or two. 
 When I have one in the oven and Frank throws up in our bed in the middle of the night or Monica tries to hang herself in a closet with an old shoelace. 
 He's a big boy, he can make his own decisions. 
 Hey, Carl. 
 Sleep okay? 
 What do you think? 
 FIONA: You hungry? 
 Let me make you a sandwich. CARL: Okay. 
 Disability check doesn't come for another week, Frank. 
 I went to visit your mother in the hospital this morning. 
 We have to get her out of there. 
 Best place for her. 
 She's fragile. She's broken. 
 They want to make her normal. 
 They want to help her. 
 By which they mean average, boring, medicated, a Stepford Monica. 
 She tried to kill herself last night; boring would be a blessing. 
 They perform lobotomies now. 
 No, they don't. 
 Shock treatment? No. 
 Actually, I think they do. Princess Leia did it. 
 100,000 volts of electricity zapped into her skull! 
 Draws so much power, it takes out entire city blocks. 
 When our lights dim, some poor fucker's getting his brains fried. 
 Don't listen to him, Carl. 
 Eat your breakfast. 
 What's a lobotomy? 
 They jam a screwdriver into your head and scramble your brains. 
 No, they don't. Jesus, Frank. 
 Yeah, they do! They're gonna put Mom back on her me. They're gonna make her better. 
 She's not better on her meds. 
 She's a zombie. She gives up everything she loves in life. 
 Yeah, like what? Drugs, alcohol, you? 
 Us. 
 I'm gonna bust her out of there before they steal what makes Monica Monica. 
 Are you with me? 
 Leave her alone, Frank. 
 She needs a chance to get well. 
 Somebody can steal what makes you you? 
 No. Carl? 
 He's not helping you, either. 
 Can I bring my Mac-10 pistol? 
 Leave him out of this. The pistol's going back to the cops. Where's your sister? 
 Shower. 
 Leave Debbie alone, Frank! No. 
 Monica will be better when she comes out of the hospital, Carl. 
 I passed. 
 The GED-- I passed. 
 (gasps) 
 Daddy! 
 Daddy, you're supposed to knock! 
 Do you love your mother? 
 Cindy says they make this thing for women who can't produce their own milk. 
 You hang this doohickey around your neck, and then you tape these right over your nipples. 
 And the baby can still breast-feed. 
 It's okay, honey, I-I can do it. 
 No, it's important for both of us to bond with him. 
 Okay. 
 (fussing) 
 Okay. 
 There, sweet boy. 
 (chuckling): Whoa. 
 Wow. 
 That's... Whoa. 
 Whoa! 
 (laughs) 
 Now I know what all the fuss is about. 
 (rattling at door) 
 (gasps) Someone's here. Oh. 
 (door opens) 
 Mom? 
 Mom. 
 Sweetie! 
 My goodness! Home already? 
 Did the hospital let you leave? 
 Where is it? 
 Thought they usually like to keep you for at least a day. Where is it, Mom? 
 Where's what, honey? 
 It. 
 The baby that shoved its ginormous head out of my cooter for six endless hours last night. 
 Oh, my. Did they lose it? 
 They showed me the video footage of you taking it. 
 Oh, that baby. They were gonna call the police, but I said no. 
 Where is it? 
 Now, Mom! In the dryer. 
 Take it out. 
 I think he's napping. 
 Take it out! 
 I don't want to touch it! 
 You're leaking. 
 (sighs) 
 Isn't he beautiful? 
 Take it back to the hospital. 
 Somebody will want it. 
 I want it. 
 Well, you can't have it. 
 He's such a sweet boy. 
 He never cries. 
 He's so handsome. 
 We want to name him Hiram after your grandfather. 
 Or maybe Ming, to keep him wired into his Chinese-ness. 
 Shut up, Jody. 
 It's going back. 
 Karen, please don't do this. 
 They'll give it to the retarded freaks' home or whatever. 
 He's my grandson. 
 I won't let you throw him away like used Kleenex. 
 You know, Karen, your mom might be right. 
 Maybe she should keep him for a while. 
 You know, who knows what social services is going to do with him? 
 Butt out, Lip! 
 What are you even doing here? 
 He's not even yours. 
 This is none of your goddamn business. 
 At least call Tim Wong or whoever the father is and tell him about it. 
 Get out! 
 You dodged a f*cking RPG getting tossed over by this one. 
 Don't I know it, man. 
 Take it back to the hospital. 
 (door opens and closes) 
 What if they won't take it back? 
 Then drop it in a basket and leave it at the fire station. 
 I don't give a sh1t. 
 SHEILA: No. 
 No. 
 Yes! 
 He is staying with me. 
 Fine! 
 Then I'm calling the police. 
 Lip here? 
 Lip! 
 It's your sister. 
 So... 
 How'd you find me? 
 Jimmy. 
 How's Karen? 
 Girl's a f*cking bitch. 
 My cousin, Eli, was born with a foot coming out of his knee. 
 Now he's a blacksmith. 
 Only one who can pump the bellows without using his hands. 
 I passed my GED. 
 Don't look so surprised. 
 No, I'm not. 
 That's, um... that's great. 
 So... deal's a deal. 
 Ah, too late. 
 Spilt milk. I passed. 
 You go back to school. Water under the bridge. 
 Knock off the clichés. 
 Road not taken. 
 I want you home, Lip. 
 We all do. 
 Right. 
 FRANK: It's cold water and sleep deprivation. 
 Make you stand all day with electrodes tied to your genitals. 
 I think you're mistaking Cook County for Abi Grabie. 
 Abu Gradie. Abu Ghraib. 
 Did a tour with the Guard-- Basra. 
 They don't do any of that, Frank. 
 I was in there last year after my accidental overdose. 
 Accidental? You set yourself on fire freebasing. 
 It was mostly us sitting in a circle in a group talking about how your family screwed you up. KEVIN: Oh, Monica talking about Frank? 
 That ought to take a while. 
 Frank, you got any cash? 
 Moolah? Green? 
 I got to spring her out of there.

 Support services technician? I thought he was a janitor. 
 A job's a job. 
 At least Pat's got one. 
 What time's Patty go to work?

 We're on for tonight. 
 What's tonight? Dinner with my family. 
 You asked, you got it. 
 Are they coming here? 
 Uh... no. 
 Dad hasn't been south of the Art Institute Gala since Billy Joel played Comiskey Park in '84. 
 Going to their house for dinner? Nope. 
 Uh, Mom would have to have you deloused first. 
 She's a germophobe. 
 You want an almond out of the serving dish, you have to wear surgical gloves and use tongs. 
 I met your mom. 
 She's... she's cool. 
 You met his mom? 
 Candace. 
 A little heavy on the Botox and Chanel No. 5, but nice. 
 So where are we meeting? 
 Uh, Morton's, downtown. 
 Dad has a wine locker there. 
 Little brass plaque with his name on it and everything. 
 Everybody invited? Yep. Dad's buying, so order the most expensive thing on the menu. Prime rib? 
 Sure. Bone-in porterhouse steak? 
 Anything you want. What do you say, Debs, free meal? 
 No can do, Jim. Busy. 
 Doing what? Sleeping over at Holly Herkimier's. 
 Don't do anything she does. 
 Big-ass lobster?

 I don't know. 
 Maybe. I-I don't know. 
 I don't get how you have a kid and not give a sh1t what happens to it. 
 Retarded, two heads, no face, whatever-- it's still you. 
 No face? 
 Yeah, well, maybe it would have to have a face. 
 You should go home. 
 Oh, you kicking me out? 
 Get your ass back in the house and stop thinking so much. 
 You want to f*ck again? 
 I'm only gonna be up a couple more minutes.

 Hey, pal. 
 Hey, buddy! Pal! 
 Got a light? When are you gonna give those up? 
 They're gonna kill you. 
 MAN: I know. 
 I'm gonna try hypnosis next. 
 Uh, no, don't. No, sorry. 
 Where's your I.D. badge? 
 Oh, left it in my locker. 
 Shift's not over. 
 Left my inhaler...

 ...in the car. 
 Tuberculosis and asthma. Horrible. 
 MAN (over radio): Chuck, we got trouble on seven. 
 Psych unit. Roger that. 
 Got to keep your I.D. badge visible at all times on hospital grounds.
