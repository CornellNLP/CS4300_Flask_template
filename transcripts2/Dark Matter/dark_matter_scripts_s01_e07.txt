 Previously on Dark Matter... 
 We all woke up just like you, You said someone was responsible for wiping our memories. Five : No, not me, it was someone else. It's like I'm remembering it for them. I might be able to adapt some of the medical equipment to work as a kind of mind probe. And who's mind would we be probing? Mine. So, who the hell is Ms. Maplethorpe, anyway? She was a teacher I had when I was a kid. It's as good a code as any. One : Who the hell is Ms. Maplethorpe, anyway? Who the hell is Ms. Maplethorpe, anyway? Six : It's as good a code as any. I know I'll never forget it. I know it! I know the code! I know the code! It's Maplethorpe. (knocking) It's open. I can come back. No, it's okay. Uhh.. What do you want? Uhh, status report. What's your status? I'm fine, thanks but I was talking about the ship. What about it? Well umm, apparently all systems are operating below optimal levels. The Android is on top of it. Also, our food stores are down to four days and our water levels have dropped. I do love my long showers. Umm she's working on shoring up the recycling system. I told her if it means drinking other people's urine  than I'd rather die of dehydration. You're fine with drinking your own though? Gotta draw the line somewhere. Look, the uhh, the bottom line is she's doing the best she can, but this bucket needs more work than one android can handle. Yeah. You can turn around now. Anything else? Uhh yeah, we have a damaged relationship. Do we? If it gets any worse we're gonna have to shut it down. A damaged relationship? Relay switch. I said relay switch. No, you didn't. I think you heard me wrong. There's a relay switch on the lower level... Look, the ship is in a state of disrepair and we can't afford to fix it. There's no news there. Why don't we just be honest with each other? You're not here to give me a status report. Why do you think I'm here? To get a status report. What makes you say that? Alright yes, you and Three have been acting pretty distant toward each other lately. And if you want my opinion, you can do better than him. He has at least one redeeming quality. I think it's just easy for you not to get emotionally attached. What makes you say that? Because I can't imagine anyone getting emotionally attached to him. Oh you think I couldn't help myself with you because you're hopelessly irresistible? I didn't... I'm not... Well status is, it's over. You and Three? What happened? He didn't like all the names I was calling him during s*x. Is that what this is about? What? You flirting with me? For your information, if I was flirting with you, I would be taking my clothes off, not putting them on. What are you doing? What, I thought... You thought wrong. But if? No, it's complicated. Right. And also that. Don't stop on my account. Did you need anything? Five figured out the code to the mystery room. You're kidding. And we're about to open it but if you two have something better to do. No. (door opening) That's it? I think that's as open as they're gonna get. Six : Why is everything on this ship so much work? Two : Clear. The panel appears to be malfunctioning. Of course it is. Give me a moment. (bang) Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoa-ho-ho! Hah, alright! I'm gonna call you Racquel. All these are locked. Ah, just stand aside. See if I can fix that. Don't be stupid. We don't know what's in there. It could be packed with explosives. You know, anyone else wondering why you need to lock a box that's inside a locked room. Could be something we stole that we just haven't gotten around to opening yet. Hey, anybody know what this is? All : Woah, woah! What? I suggest you be careful not to activate it. Oh. (chuckling) Well I know what this is. We're rich! Hoo-hoo-hoo! Uh, guys. She's alive. The pod's hooked up to the ships power but there's no data link. That would explain why this chamber never showed up on any of our system scans. But what is she doing in here? You think she's got her memories? Let's thaw her, find out. Are we sure we want to do that? She's obviously in here for a reason. Any dreams or visions that would explain it? No. Let's thaw her and find out. I said that like five seconds ago. Yeah, but coming from her, it actually sounds reasonable. (power generating) You're welcome. (scanner sounds) How come she's not waking up? She'd been in stasis for a long time. I have her sedated until I can fully evaluate  her physical condition. And? She has Tataryn's disease. It's a disorder common on planets  where they mine Serillium, a result of the run-off from  refineries leaching into the water supply. In its advanced state, it causes rapid decline in specific neurological motor function related to autonomic life-support. There's no known cure. Wait, so she's dying? Without question. It's probably why she was in the pod in the first place to halt the progress of the disease. If we keep her out, how long does she have? It's impossible to say. It could be a matter of days. We've gotta put her back in there. You're the one that wanted to take her out in the first place. This is different, we should put her back in. Hey, we need to find out what she knows. (lock breaks) Check it out. Maybe, it's the Android's sister. Two : A service bot? One : Entertainment model. Disassembled but in good condition. Well proportioned. Woah. I'll say. She's got a wide range of capabilities. Magic tricks. Twirling. Contortion. Android : I'm preparing to wake the woman we found in stasis. Okay. On my way. Go ahead. Bring the bot online. I'm sure she's got a great personality to go with that body. (whoosh) It's amazing how the skin fuses so you can't even see the seams. Five : It says her programming is standard issue  for an entertainment model. I don't think she's gonna be much help with repairs or anything like that. Well, she can learn, can't she? And anyway there's lots she can do in the meantime. Just turn her on. I mean, activate her. (beeping) Hello. My name is Wendy. Would you like to run a full demonstration of my capabilities? Uh no, that's alright, we umm, we read the manual, Wendy. Why does she talk like that? Umm, the factory default is set to something called "Aussie." Cool. What can I do for you? I can sing you a song. I'm programmed in multiple popular musical styles. Dubstep, Tropical House, Classical. No thanks. That's umm, that's fine. Perhaps you'd like to take advantage of my advanced culinary programming. We don't have much to work with. Our rations are kind of low. Not to worry. I'll extend the rations by double and make them taste better than you could ever imagine. Show me the kitchen. Android : You were in stasis. Now you're safe on board our ship. Who are you? You can call me Two. I was about to ask you the same thing. My name is Sarah. Do you remember how you got here? Marcus! Thank god you're here. Look, I don't know how to tell you this but... What's wrong? We had an accident with our stasis pods. In a way, you're lucky that you weren't stored with us because we all lost our memories. None of us can remember anything from before a couple weeks ago. Are you serious? You really don't remember me? I'm sorry, believe me I wish I did but I... Then why did you revive me? We thought that maybe you would have some answers for us. I don't know you, or you. I've never seen this ship before. The last thing I remember was Marcus putting me in stasis on my homeworld telling me everything would be all right. This looks amazing. Six : I can get used to this. Mmm. I've utilized less than two percent of current rations for the creation of this meal. Mmm, oh wow! This is even better than I expected. Yeah. I'm glad. Mmm. You'll be happy to know I've improved the efficiency of the coolant systems by eleven percent. Way to go. Wendy increased the taste of our food by a hundred percent. Android : I see. You should also know that if I hadn't effected the repairs, the system would have completely in a matter of days, crippling the ship. Good catch. Wow. Mmm, wow! Shall I prepare the next course? There's a next course? Hell yeah! (laughing) My god! Mmm. How much do you know about "Marcus"? I-I know what he... What he was, what he is. It didn't... It doesn't matter. On my world, anyone who stood up to the Corporations was an outlaw. How did you meet? It was the end of a terrible winter. I was out early one morning gathering firewood. I found him lying in the forest near my farm. At first, I thought he was dead. I managed to get him back to my house and dress his wounds. Later he told me later he was a mercenary for hire. That he'd been wounded on a mission,  and the others he was with left him behind. Did he say who they were? No. And were you alone when you found him? Yeah, I had been living on my own for over a year after my husband died in the uprising. He was a miner. The uprising? We knew people were getting sick, but the Ferrous doctors kept told us everything was fine. Then people started dying. That's when the rebellion started. But we didn't stand a chance. Did Three ever umm... Marcus. Did Marcus tell you what he was doing on your planet? He'd said that he was hired by a rival corporation  to hijack a shipment of Serillium. The mission did not go as planned. Several of his crew were killed. And when he didn't make it back to the rendezvous point, they probably assumed he was dead. So, you saved his life. And he saved mine. ♪ At least for a while. (grunting) (sword whipping) Hey, you missed quite the meal. I don't eat for pleasure. Right, anyway. I wanted to introduce you to Wendy. I'm pleased to meet you. If there's anything I can ever do for you please don't hesitate to ask. I don't require entertainment. Well, you do require a massage. Why do you say that? Your left shoulder sits two millimeters below your right,  possibly indicating tension  in your right supraspinatus or lats. It could affect your overall precision and technique. Well, it feels fine to me. (laughs) Turn around. She's not gonna hurt you. (moans) Is that better? Umm. It feels the same, no difference. Shall I stop? No. Easy tiger. Ahh! There you are. Don't start. Did you finish that "thing" you needed to do? Don't start. Hey, you have to talk to her. What am I supposed to say, huh? I don't know but it's obvious there's something between the two of you, or at least there was. Yeah, but I don't remember. So what's the point? Look, against all imaginable odds it turns out that somebody in this galaxy doesn't think you're a total jerk. She's alone in that room and scared out of her mind. And apparently, you're the one who brought her on this ship. What are you going to do about it? Uh, hi there. Hi. Uhh listen, I'm sorry about before. I guess this whole thing's just got me a little weirded out so... Yeah, me too. You um, do you wanna go for a walk or something? Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'd like that. Ok. Alright. (gasp) God! I-I didn't realize you were there. What would you like to do now? Uh... I'm programmed with various recreational subroutines. Do you like fun? Uhh, uhh I guess. What kind of fun would you like to have? We could dance. Play a game. Umm, no thank you. I was actually about to lie down. Excellent. Would you like me to join? I'm adept at a wide variety of contemporary erotic techniques: quasaring, the infinite moebius, dunking the cosmic donut... That's... I really shouldn't. Umm, wait. What was that last one? On the other hand, if you prefer male anatomy I come with interchangeable parts. No, no, no, no. I appreciate the offer. But I umm, it's just a little weird. What's weird about it? Sexuality is a natural human function. Sure, but you're an android. I mean, what do you get out of it? I possess almost three thousand touch receptors. I can experience pleasure. I sense anxiety. If you like, I can turn off my performance analytics before we begin. Look, I appreciate the offer, I just don't think I'd feel right. Or... On the other hand, there's only one way to find out. Really? She's not complicated. (electronic buzzing) (British accent) 'ello, you look to be in a right smashing good mood. You'll be chuffed to 'ear I've found a way ter convert the engine's residual byproducts into a nutritious, protein-rich meal supplement. Why are you talking like that? (Irish accent) Oh, ye noticed. It so 'appens that I too come programmed wif several unique linguistic varieties. (German accent) Zhere ofer two tozen eccents to choose vrom. You can zelect vone or ve can go vith a taily rotation. I umm, I don't... (Jamacian accent) Don't worry about it, mon. Yuh dun havtah decide rite dis second. (Chinese accent) Dere's ova twooooo dozon. No. Just no. (Australian accent) Maybe, we can twalk about it a bit layta then. Home sweet home. I'm sorry about that, let me just move these. It's okay, you don't have to apologize. I know the kind of world you live in. Yeah but there's no where to sit so... You have to believe me. There was a time when we were together... That you were different. 
 
 (ax hacking wood) Dinner is ready. Are you going somewhere? This was a mistake. I don't think so. No. You know, Sarah, you don't know who I am. I'm not the guy who stays, I'm the guy who leaves. You don't have to be. Sarah? That was the first sign that there was something wrong with me. Sarah! Look at me. What's wrong? After that, I was nothing but a burden. You could've left at any time. But you didn't. You stayed. Maybe I felt guilty. That might have kept you for maybe a day or two. But not for months. Not for a whole winter. Feeding me. Taking care of me. I gotta be honest with you that doesn't sound like me. Look, you may not know it, but I do... You are a good man. (Sarah coughing) Whatcha doing? I'm going through the medical database, looking for any new information on Tataryn's disease. Find anything useful? Not yet. You're doing something new with your hair. Wendy did it for me. Do you like it? I don't believe there was anything wrong with the way it was before. You don't like her much, do you? I don't have an opinion either way. I just think there are more relevant functions she could be performing besides cooking and playing games. Stress can cause humans to act inefficient. Relieving stress can be a lot like recharging batteries. Laughter is the best medicine. Something like that. I'm not programmed for humor. Well, just because people are having a little fun with Wendy doesn't mean we don't appreciate what you do. I mean, I don't think we could get by without you. According to my self-diagnostics, my performance is satisfactory in every way that my programming dictates. Now don't go getting a big head or anything. My head is always a consistent size. See, who says you're not funny? Look, Wendy is new here and she's just trying to fit in. I know what that feels like. I think if you gave her a chance, you'd really like her. (whoosh) (keyboard clicking) What are you doing? I have tidied the room and am now attempting to learn the ship's system. So I can be more helpful. Is there anything I can do for you? No, I'm good. I could tell you what most pleases One sexually. What makes you think I would wanna know that? Your body temperature rises .25 degrees when you're around him. Also, blood flow to your cheeks increases also indicating... Okay, that's enough. Where is One, anyways? I think he's in the mess hall. I made him something special. What happened? I don't know, she just collapsed. She's breathing but I can't wake her, can you help her? No, I don't know what to do. Where's the Android? She went to the bridge to run a diagnostic. Okay. Android, we need you in the infirmary. I'm on my way. Hello. Hello. I'd like to inform you that your presence no longer offends me. As a new member of this ship's extended crew,  it must be difficult to fit in, especially in that outfit. And I've been less than welcoming. I regret my actions that I can only attribute to a flaw in my programming. I misjudged you and I'm sorry. (gunshots) Apology not accepted. (clicks) Mmm. How's lunch? Fantastic. Even he's on board. Her soup is umm, very good. (door closing) That's weird. (machine beeping) We're locked in. We just dropped out of FTL. Two : Android, this is Two, we got problem, One, Four, Six and I are locked in the mess. Android, do you read? (beeping) Crew of the Raza, this is Cyrus King. I'm sure you're surprised to be hearing my voice. You probably thought I was dead. Maybe if we remembered who you were. I arranged for you to acquire this service android knowing that when you activated it, I would finally get my revenge. (beeping) You killed everyone in my unit. Burned them all alive. Probably deserved it. Now you're going to suffer the same fate. Your ship has been directed to fly into the nearest star. (whoosh) Here's hoping your last moments will be as tortured and painful as possible. Come with me. Three, do you read me? Go ahead. Our Android's offline and we're trapped in the mess. Is Five with you? Yeah. Good, tell her to stay put. I need you to get to the port side sub-level power relay. You can shut down the engines from there. It'll buy us some time, slow our progress toward the star, so we can figure a way out of this. But you don't know how... Shh. Do you understand me? Yeah, I understand. Three out. Kill your comm. I-I don't get it. She knows you don't know how to do that. Yeah, but Wendy doesn't know. She's monitoring comms. So you're the bait. Exactly. Once Wendy leaves the bridge, I need you to get in there and find a way to work around whatever it is she's done. I'll distract her. That's gonna take some time. I'll give you all I can, kid. Go. (door closes) Hey. What's going on? We're having a little technical problems with the ship. It's gonna be okay, we're gonna fix it. But your condition's gotten worse so we're gonna put you back in stasis. No, no, no, no, not yet... I promise I will not rest until I've done everything I can to save you. Okay. Okay. I guess a little rest now and then isn't such a bad thing. No. I wish that I remember. It's okay. We'll make new memories. I'll see you soon, okay? Yeah. Promise? I promise. Okay. (whoosh) ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ (gunshot) (bang) Woah! (gunshot) This is Three do your thing. Do you have her engaged? I guess you could say that. (gunshots) Ugh! (boom) Good, can you keep her busy? I can try. Damn it! Five, where are you? I'm on the bridge, but I-I can't access the nav system, she's locked me out. I'm trying to find a work-around. We'll get to that in a minute. For now, see if you can access non-essential systems. Switch all doors to manual. I'm on it. (grunting) (bang) I've got it! Good girl. You're with me. (grunting) Ah! (punching) (grunting) (crash) (grunting) Wait! This runs counter to your programming! Fun, remember?! Fun? I don't remember fun. I just remember cooking and cleaning and dunking the cosmic doughnut. Ahh, wait, what was that last one? Doughnut. (groaning) I thought you were designed to serve, not kill! I find your view on female androids both antiquated and offensive. You okay? Never better, why do you ask? Two, this is Six. We've taken care of the robot. Yeah well, I wish that was the worst of our problems. We're locked out of navigation, and we're still headed straight for the star. There's no way to change course. (electrics sparking) We don't have that kind of time. This is Two. Is Wendy's head damaged? It's detached, but it looks okay. Good, bring the head to the bridge and be quick. In the meantime, space her body. (electrics sparking) (power dying) The power is dying all over the ship. How are we going to find the code in all that? There's a log that's recorded on a timeline. She has to have set the passcode sometime within the last hour. Won't work on manual we'll have to reset. All right. Whoa, woah, woah, woah! We got a problem here, Wendy's body just came alive. We powered the head. It must've activated the body remotely. Ah, it's no big deal. Robot can't see without her head. Ah! Scratch that, she can see us just fine! How is that possible? It's the link! She's tied into the ship's internal sensors. We gotta pull the plug! Not yet. I don't have the code. Any time now would be good! Got it, we've got nav control! (sparking) Come on. You all right? (chuckling) I hate robots. How long do you think it'll take for her to fully regenerate? Depends on how extensive the damage is. We'll have to wait and see. No, no. What happened? The pod must've been damaged by the power fluctuations. Without stasis, the disease ran it's course. It's my fault. It was my idea to activate the robot. It was stupid. Did you program that thing to attack us? No. Did you give Sarah an incurable disease? No. Then what are we talking about? Yeah? Hey is this a bad time for a status update? Can't it wait? It's going to take us some to sort through all the items we found in the mystery room. Some are locked and inaccessible for now but uhh, we've got enough funds to effect full repairs, re-stock, and even have enough leftover for a few luxury items. Great. Maybe another robot, one of those entertainment models. A less buggy version? No, thanks. Latent killer sub-program aside, she was a damn good cook. And, I imagine, she had other worthy skills. Look, I don't know what I was thinking. I have a pretty good idea. Well, as it turns out, I was wrong. It was complicated. I've been thinking. Maybe, complicated isn't such a bad thing.
