 Previously on "Dark Matter"... 
 Ah! 
 [grunting] Someone sold us out. My real name is Lieutenant Kal Varrick. I get the sense that she might know a way out of here. Seriously? We are really going to try to escape from the inescapable prison on a moon with no atmosphere. We're the crew of the "Raza." You're damn right we're doing it. Long time, no see. [silenced gunfire] [silenced gunshot] They need to understand that no one messes with me. No, cut them loose. [chuckles] Yeah, I don't care. Well, if they're smart, they'll see it coming, and if not, I've got no sympathy for them. Yeah, just do it. You know what? I'm gonna have to go because Hughes is about to interrupt me with some very important news. We have confirmed reports that the fugitive ship "Raza" was captured by the Galactic Authority. And what does that have to do with me? This was the crew manifest forwarded to the Galactic Authority. [scoffs] I don't believe it. We finally found her. Hello, pumpkin. [electricity crackles] [dramatic music] What exactly is going on here? Sit down. Why has the trial been postponed? According to your commanding officer, you were on board the "Raza" for approximately 3 1/2 months. That's correct. But two months in, you lost contact. I was compromised. Two members of the crew discovered I was Galactic Authority and planned to kill me. Evidently they failed. They didn't get a chance. Five saved me. She wrote a program intending to target their memories during stasis, but instead it wiped the memories of the entire crew. Including your own. Lieutenant Anders reported your memory loss after your encounter on Arrakis Sadr. He told me the truth. And he arranged for you to acquire the assets needed to complete your mission. That's right. Neurotoxin and an explosive device to cripple the engines. But you didn't act. At least not right away. I was in a difficult position. After the memory wipe you had no way of knowing that you weren't really one of them. You had to assume they were your partners, your friends. What are you suggesting? I'm suggesting that your judgment may have been clouded. I brought them in. Not right away. I just needed time. And you're sure it had nothing to do with the destruction of a Mikkei research facility on Iriden 3? They were illegally conducting research into white hole technology, and it literally blew up in their faces. That's only the official version. Unofficially, there were rumors that the device was stolen from another corp and delivered by a third party in a ploy to test it and let Mikkei take the fall. If that's true, some would consider that a deliberate act of war by one corporation against another. It also means whoever delivered the device could be considered an accessory to mass murder. I know the "Raza" was there. I can't prove it yet, but I will. We're done for now. This is gonna be a problem. No kidding. Well, what if we don't cooperate? We're under contract to the GA, she's the ranking GA officer. Yeah, but who does she really work for? I don't know, but we may have to move up our timetable. Emily Kolburn. That's your real name in case you didn't know. I know. For now, I'm sticking with Five. Great. Five, can you tell me how you ended up on the "Raza"? I don't remember. Care to speculate? At first I thought maybe... kidnapping victim. But then I read your file and I realized, there's no one out there who would give a damn if you were taken. Now I'm thinking stowaway. Maybe. I-I don't know. Why didn't they get rid of you first chance they got? Because you make yourself useful. What did you do on that ship? [exhales sharply] I fixed things. I-I have a head for gadgets, electronics, stuff like that. [exhales sharply] That's unfortunate. Why? That potentially makes you an accomplice to any illegal activity conducted while you were onboard. So what? Including the murder of 15,000 people on Iriden 3. [chuckles] You're making a mistake. You think you're protecting your friends. There's already enough evidence from their previous crimes to put them away forever. You are the only one who has anything to lose here. If you can convict them without my help, then do it. Leave me alone. What about Lieutenant Varrick? Six? What about him? He's about to perjure himself to protect you from these charges. If you admit to your involvement and tell me everything, I can guarantee you immunity, and he won't have to sacrifice himself. He made his choice. Hmm. [chuckles] Listen, you little sh1t, I can make life very ugly for you. I can lock you away in a tiny cell until you're old and gray and broken. Or I can play nice. No, I don't think you can. What makes you say that? Because you're obviously an incredible bitch. You got balls, kid, I'll give you that. She hasn't given anything up yet. No, but I got a feeling this GA bitch is just getting started. She's already lined up the other three for their sit-downs. Well, then, you'd better make sure we get to them first. Do you think that's a good idea? This happens under her nose, there's gonna be hell to pay. Look, this is a direct ask from Traugott Corp. And they scare me a hell of a lot more than the GA. Traugott wants them dead, just make it happen. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I think it's a raisin. At least I really hope it's a raisin. You gonna eat that apple? So how's it coming? How's what coming? Your escape plan. There is no escape plan. We were told to keep our noses clean. That's what we're doing. You mean Arax? You're telling me you're scared? We're not looking for trouble. Are you kidding me? Three things I know for sure, you don't scare, you thrive on trouble, and if you want off this rock, you're going to need my help. How do you figure that? Even if you could just snap your fingers, make every guard disappear, unlock every door, you're still not going anywhere. There's only one way off this rock, and that's by shuttle. They know that, which is why they never keep one docked for very long. What's that got to do with you? It's all about the timing. And it just so happens that I know the supply run schedule for the next month. How? I've got a little operation going, trading goods for services, like information. So you deal in contraband. I offer hard-to-source products for discerning and cooperative buyers. You see, that's how things work around here. Quid pro quo. And what would you want in return, Nyx? Your extra pillow and a hug good-bye. What do you think it is I want? This is what I like. All together. Saves me the trouble. These three got a new work detail. All right. I'm done washing other people's underwear. You're on waste disposal. At least let me finish mine. Whatever this is. We'll pack it up for you. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ You know, someday, we're all gonna look back on this and still be very angry. Hey! Save your chitchat for the showers. [sniffs] We're on the clock. Whatever doesn't get recycled gets incinerated. Come on, let's go. All right, move your asses. We don't have all day. You better watch yourself. Let's go. Lucky boy. Hey. What the hell? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Hey, open up! Hear me? I'm sure he can hear you just fine. Come on. I thought laundry duty was bad. [coughing] [grunts] Good luck. [breathing heavily] Oh, God. [coughing] [all coughing] You okay? I'd say somewhere between rare and medium-well. You son of a bitch. Look at you, all hot under the collar. What the hell was that? An unfortunate accident. In a place like this, they happen all the time. Am I right? Walk away. You gotta be kidding me. Walk away. Yeah? You just made a huge mistake. You tell Kazan those three are with me now. It's your funeral. Android. Hello, Lieutenant. What's this? A necessary precaution. I intend no harm to anyone. And yet you refuse to cooperate. What are you talking about? She has a detailed record of everything she experienced on that ship, but she's refusing to release the files. Can't you just extract them? Normally, yes. But she's created an elaborate security protocol that'll wipe everything if we try, including her personality matrix. That's a little extreme, isn't it? Effectively, you cease to exist. As do we all... eventually. By refusing to cooperate, you're disobeying a direct order from a human superior. My loyalty is to my crew. I take my orders from them. [exhales sharply] Over to you. Android, I understand what you're trying to do. But it's pointless. I'm ordering you to cooperate with the investigation. I'm afraid that won't be possible. Why not? Because you're no longer a member of this crew. In fact, it's arguable if you ever really were. Murder, assault, piracy, arson, theft, smuggling. I don't recall. I honestly can't remember. Do you think that fact somehow absolves you from your past crimes? No. Although I'm sure there are others who do remember and would love to remind me. Your propensity for violence is remarkable. [chuckles] Thank you. For years you've left behind a wake of misery and destruction. I have also been told that I chew with my mouth open. What's your point? My point is, none of it matters... if you play your cards right. Really? I don't care about the crimes you committed before the mind wipe. I'm only interested in what happened after you woke up from stasis. Specifically, the events leading up to and immediately following your delivery of the white hole device that destroyed Iriden 3. Doesn't ring a bell. Hmm. No? Planet killer? Over 15,000 lives lost. Still nothing? Look, why don't we just cut to the chase and call this what it really is. Okay. It's a whitewash. It's a cover-up. You're looking for someone to take the fall. I'm looking for the truth. Even if the truth could start a corporate war? I'm prepared to offer a deal to whoever talks first. I'm not interested. Forget it. I'm listening. Full immunity from any prosecution across the board. A clean slate. In exchange for testimony that corroborates what we already know. I'm just getting settled in here. Do you know that I put a down payment on a new toothbrush? This deal should be of particular interest to you, given the recent developments. This is an extradition request. There's an Ishida cruiser in orbit. They say they're not leaving until we turn you over. You've been convicted in absentia. If I sign this order, they will deliver you back to Zairon for public execution. Take the day to think about it. The cruiser's not going anywhere. It reflects poorly on the command structure here when my own guards cannot arrange the deaths of a few prisoners. There were unforeseen circumstances. What happened? Arax Nero. He and his crew stepped in, saved them. Why? Who are they to him? I don't know. Maybe it's a shakedown. He wants his piece of the payout. Or maybe he's just pissed we didn't come to him first. You know how touchy these guys get. Anyway, what's the problem? They didn't talk. We'll get 'em next time. The problem is someone is requesting immediate visitation rights. Deny 'em. I cannot. Who is it? Hey. If we're going back to my cell, we're going the wrong direction. I suppose you boys already know that, right? Whatever. Hello, my friend. It's been a while. This is a surprise. I'll say. I was expecting Two. Hmm But, you'll do, I suppose. Nice to see you too. So what brings you by? Gonna pull a few strings? Get us sprung for old time's sake? Unfortunately, the list of charges that you're facing makes that impossible. I'm afraid it does not look very good. Well, thanks for the pep talk. I hear they've been questioning you about the destruction of our research facility on Iriden 3. The subject has come up. I also hear none of you are talking. That's unfortunate. 'Cause if we come clean then the blame for all that illegal research shifts from Mikkei to certain other parties. As it rightly should. We incriminate ourselves in the process. I believe you were offered a deal. Did you authorize that deal? Offer the deal to all three of us. Look... it's not just your freedom that's at stake here. As long as you're alive, you are a liability to certain parties, as you put it. But you come clean now, well, they have no reason to go after you. Did you really think that was going to work? No. Nah. But I figured it was worth a shot. Good try. [chuckles] Well, good luck to you, then. Do me a favor. Consider what I said. Sure. No. Look me in the eye. Tell me you'll think about it. [chuckles] There is not a chance in hell that I will think about it. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Say hi to the rest of the gang for me. Yeah, I will. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Ah! They let you have makeup in this place? It's illegal in here, but if you have connections like I do, then... Two days rations for a lipstick. You got a date tonight? Just give me the lipstick. Come on. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ You wanted it the hard way. ♪ ♪ What do you mean she gave you something? It's kinda hard to explain. It's better if I just show you. Look under the mattress. What? It's the layout to this entire prison. Including restricted areas. Well, now we're getting somewhere. Yeah. Someone's coming. [exhales sharply] Arax wants to see you. I hope you don't mind, but I figured you'd be looking to thank me for saving your life. Thanks. My pleasure. Hey, are those grapes? Go ahead. Help yourself. You can relax. You three are now under my protection. Well, that's convenient because, for a while there, you were the one who we needed protection from. How'd you sneak these grapes past security? I mean, seriously. No, forget it. I don't want to know. I had a change of heart. I'm giving you the go-ahead. You want us to escape? I want us to escape. You come up with a plan, I'm coming with. That's the deal. What do we get out of it? My blessing... And help on the outside. You're gonna have to do better than that. What do you need? A riot. When the time comes, I need your crew to instigate a brawl that will set off the security protocol. When that sonic disabler goes off, we'll all be down for the count. Not all of us. No, sorry. Can't let you in. Let her through. What do you want, Nyx? I know what this conversation is about. Nyx has kindly offered to help us out. Except there's a problem. The regular supply shuttle's been suspended until further notice. We're not going anywhere. ♪ ♪ So the supply run's been temporarily suspended. So what? Sooner or later, it's gonna start up again. We just got to be patient, give it some time. And hope we can outlast those who are gunning for us in here. No, man, we don't have the time. We don't have a ship either. Actually... I think I can get one. So I hear you're ready to talk deal. No. I'm here to end the discussion. I'm passing on your offer. If I sign this order, you will be shipped back to Zairon for execution. I look forward to returning to my home world. Even if only for a short visit. Is that your report? Yeah, Shaddick wants me to file it before the end of the... Is there anything in there about Iriden 3? What do you know about that? Delete it. The crew of the "Raza" is not getting off this rock alive. The warden's been paid off, the fix is in. I didn't bring them here to be assassinated. Nothing you can do about it. I'll talk to Shaddick. She doesn't give a damn about them or you. She just wants to make her case against Traugott. Don't you see what's going on here? Ferrous and Mikkei are busy worrying about each other, meanwhile some of the other players get together and decide it's time to make a move. Hell, they already got to Moss, and he was connected. What are you talking about? Your friend Moss, the one with Corso's face. They killed him. Now you understand? Come on. The crew of the "Raza"... how did you think this was gonna finish for them? Their fates were sealed a long time ago. But there's no reason for you to go down with them. If you're not gonna help me, you can't blame me for trying to help myself. What? I'm sorry. A little late, don't you think? I made a mistake. I thought I was part of a system that stood for something, but it was all a lie. You want to prove you're sorry? Then help us. So assuming we pull this thing off, and despite my normally super-positive outlook, I am not convinced that we will, we're leaving crew members behind. We don't even know where they are or what happened to them. Their best chance out of here is us. Free, armed, and back on the "Raza." You're convinced you can fly this ship without The Android? Wh... Meant robot. I'm dying to find out. Lin! You got solitary. Again. I didn't do anything. Just following orders. [scoffs] You watch yourself, Boone. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Didn't expect to see you until the trial. I'm Galactic Authority. Yeah, I know. I figured it out. So what the hell? Look, I don't have time to get into that right now. I bribed a couple of guards to make this happen. Well, then you understand how things work around here. Everyone has their price. Not everyone. I want to help you. You're the reason we're here. Look, you can hate me later. Right now, your lives are in danger. Yeah, that much I already know. What I don't know is why we should trust you. Whether you believe it or not, I still care about you guys. Besides, you've got no choice. It's been arranged. The Ishida cruiser is sending a shuttle to pick me up. When it gets here, we make our move. Where's Two? In solitary. What did she do? Nothing. I reached out to my connections. They'll find out what's going on. But we need boss lady to pull this thing off, so we gotta delay. We don't have time. My people are coming. Injure yourself. Get yourself admitted to the infirmary. Buy us some time. No. What do you mean no? I'd sooner let them take me back to Zairon before I dishonor myself. Listen... [grunts] When this is over, and we're celebrating on some beach, he'll be okay with this, right? Better hope so. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Wake up, Ryo. It's me. Misaki. Misaki? Now Han-Shireikan of the Imperial Royal Guard of Ishida. I was appointed commander following the death of our old friend Akita-san. Gomen nasai, Ryo. It seems not so long ago we were stealing away from our studies, going to the beach to practice our swordsmanship on the sand. What happened to you? Murderer, fugitive, and now coward, seeking the temporary refuge of medical regulations. I'm not a coward. Doesn't matter. The warden has approved your immediate transfer. Delay tactics won't work. It's time to go home, Ryo. You can take that thing off. She's going to cooperate now. Our little friend had a change of heart. Actually, I lied. I just wanted one last chance to say good-bye. [grunts] [tense music] ♪ ♪ This bitch is tired of playing nice. Order her to release her memory stores, or you're dead, little girl. Whoa, what the hell is going on here? We're taking custody of the prisoner. Okay, that man is on concussion protocol. Okay? He's not to be moved. The warden has made an exception. Go. Okay, look. There is a real danger that that man won't get to wherever you're taking him. He should be so lucky. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ It's on. [grunts] Ahh! [grunting] [indistinct yelling] [all grunting] What is it gonna be, kid? Okay. I'll talk to her. Android, as a member of the crew of the "Raza," you have to follow my orders, right? That's correct. You'll do what I tell you to do. Of course, Five. Kill them all. [grunts] [gunshot] [all grunting] [gunfire] [gunshot] [indistinct yelling] Let's go. [all grunting] Warden, this is Surveillance. We got a full scale riot. It's everywhere. Code black, all blocks. [sonic disabler blaring] [all groaning] Get 'em outta here. Put 'em back in the cells. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [both grunting] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [laser fires] [sonic disabler blaring] [all screaming] ♪ ♪ What the? This is Warden Treihan. Cut everything but the emergency power. Now! [alarm blaring] [all grunting] I want every available body on the floor. Off-duty, tech support, kitchen staff. I want everyone out there now! Everyone! But send one armed guard to my office. [tense music] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [gun charging] [laser blasts] [grunting] [tense music] ♪ ♪ [all grunting] Ryo! Don't run from me, coward. [all grunting] ♪ ♪ [grunts] [both grunting] Whoa. [weapon charging] [laser fire] Sorry, but we're kind of in a rush. [groaning] [indistinct yelling] Go. [dramatic music] Whoa. What the hell? What took you so long? He's on our side. He is? Get on board, let's go. Where are the others? [laser fire] Ahh! I'm guessing that's them now. Hey! Hi. Get on board, go. Hey, it's Bubba. Uh, can I catch a ride with you guys? Just get in. All right, I'll seal the airlock from this side once you guys are through. What are you talking about? We're not leaving you behind. I don't belong on that ship. He's got a point. Come on. We will drop you off anywhere you want. You can't stay here. No one's going anywhere. Step away from the airlock. No one needs to know about this. Just walk away. They're criminals. Yeah, but we're working for even bigger criminals. Just let 'em go, Anders. You know I can't. Yeah. [laser fire] [both grunting] Help me. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [lasers firing] Warden, a shuttle just launched. This way. Android, get us out of here. I am unable to establish a neural link. Go to the bridge. Do it manually. ♪ ♪ Is he gonna make it? I slowed the bleeding, but I couldn't stop it, not without surgery. And I don't have the right tools or near enough blood, so... We just escaped from a Galactic Prison. We need to lay low for a while. There's... He's not gonna last 24 hours. I have an idea. [soft music] ♪ ♪ GA officials described the cause of death as an "execution style" shooting. Genetic analysis revealed a DNA match for wealthy industrialist Derrick Moss who went missing over ten months ago following the murder of his wife. Mr. Moss had apparently undergone reconstructive surgery to mirror the appearance of this man, Jace Corso, a career criminal presently on the Galactic Authority's Ten Most Wanted list. He a friend of yours? Yeah, he was. So they didn't see it coming after all. And how did they react? I see. Well, send flowers and my condolences, and let me know when the company goes into receivership. [chuckles] You know what? I'm going to have to go because Hughes is here with some very good news for me. Okay, thanks. The crew of the "Raza" escaped last night. And our asset? On board the ship with them. Great. Now let's go get them.
