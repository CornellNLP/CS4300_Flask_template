 Previously on Dark Matter... 
 It's a Traugott research facility. 
 Our intelligence indicates they're about to make a major discovery. 
 And you want us to steal it. 
 See, we're already finishing each others thoughts. 
 Who the hell are these clowns? 
 They're your new partners. 
 You guys have any idea what we're really stealing? 
 Nice work. 
 That's my gun. 
 Not anymore. 
 [Electric Shock] 
 Two : If you think I'm gonna give you anything you can forget it. 
 Wexler : Oh no, no, no, no, no, not you, your friends. 
 See, they can either give me the code, or they can watch you get blown out into space. So what's it gonna be, folks? Don't give him anything. Hey, hey, hey, okay I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,  I'm gonna count down from five, and if no body speaks  by the time I get to zero, out she goes. Five, four, three, two... Maplethorpe! The code is Maplethorpe, with an "e". Check it out. We did the job. Why are you doing this? The collective bounty on this crew is worth as much as the device alone. Plus this way we get to keep the ship. It's what I like to call a win-win-win. Yeah, it's Cain. I'm in. We got it. You know it's really too bad, we could've had some real fun together. [screams] Noooo!! Settle down! Settle down now or she won't be the only one. Now we're gonna take a little walk together, nice and slow. Now move. Everybody inside the vault. Hey! Are we done?! Sonuvabitch broke my nose. Stand down Cain. You're a dead man. Stand down Cain. Everybody in the vault, yeah now. We need to find something to cut ourselves free. I have a knife, it's in my boot. They never frisked me. Guess sometimes it pays not to be taken seriously. Since when do you start carrying a knife? Really? It's not going to do us much good as long as we're locked in here. I can't believe she's gone. He didn't have to kill her. We gave him the code. Why did he do that? Guys like that think they need to send a message keep us from messing with him. Well he made a mistake, 'cause I'm gonna do a hell of a lot worse than that. When we get out of here, I'm gonna kill 'em all. I just signaled our friends at Volkov-Rusi. They have our position; They'll be here in two hours. Once we offloaded the device we'll head to the nearest G.A. outpost. What the hell happened to you? Ishida gave him a little trouble. Oh yeah, well you'll get revenge when you're cash your share of the bounty on his head and not before, do you understand? Fine. Good. Now, there's one other thing... You find anything useful? Nothing that's gonna get us through that door. Half these crates are still locked. I tell you when this is all over I'm gonna get a blowtorch come down here and cut every one of them open. Back off. You managed to cut yourselves free, congratulations. Yeah, now you guys can scratch yourselves while you wait for us to hand you over to the G.A. Hey, Corso, you're coming with us. Let's go. What are you going to do with him? Just a few friendly questions. Ugh. You didn't even ask me anything yet! Oh I know I know I just ah I like to set the tone you know. Ugh! Gah. Now, do you remember a small-time crook working out of the Adara sector, goes by the name of Danny Bones? If I say no, are you gonna hit me again? I just want you to tell me the truth. Then no, I don't remember. Ugh, gah! Now he remembers you. He said you were a big talker, especially after you'd had a few drinks. In particular, he remembers one evening where you both got quite inebriated, and you told him a very interesting story. About a secret stash on some uninhabited moon, where you've been putting away loot from all your jobs. You said it was worth millions. I gotta be honest, it doesn't sound like me. Really. Yeah, usually I just blow all my money on booze and women. Gah. I'm not lying. I don't remember anything about any secret stash. So ah, are you telling me that Danny Bones is a liar? Maybe. Is he a friend of yours? No. Then yeah, I'd say he's lying. Ahh. This guys alright eh. Why don't we just cut to the chase? G.A. wants us for trial. Which means if you want the bounty, you gotta keep us alive. You can't push this all the way and you both know it. I could always cut off your fingers. No. A couple of cuts and bruises is one thing, you try to turn somebody in who's been maimed and disfigured, you're gonna have to give an explanation. Smart guy, huh? You've got an answer for everything. I know the bounty on me isn't millions, but it's a tidy sum. You're not gonna risk it on the off chance that some story you heard is true. It's not worth it. Might be worth it just to shut you up. No, he's right. Seriously? You're gonna let him talk you down just like that? Did I say that? No. We're just gonna try this another way. This is ridiculous. There's gotta be something around here we can use. I already told you. There's nothing. Nothing. What about the vents? Hmm? Why don't you crawl out the vents, open the door from the outside? There are no vents in this room. It's a sealed vault. That's the whole point. You might want to calm down, we've only got so much air. Come on man, you tell me to calm down one more time, see what it gets you! Can we not do this? They blew her out into space! While we stood there and watched! And we did nothing. What were we supposed to do? I don't know. Fight back, maybe. Four and I tried. Unsuccessfully. So what you wanna just give up now? No, we're in a position of severe disadvantage. The last thing we want to do is act on emotion. The whole Zen master thing doesn't work for me. Awe man bring it. Back away. Bring it! I said back away! Come on. What do you want? Your buddy Corso needs a little company. See I got the idea from you, Sport. So, thank you. Everybody on this ship is worth money, alive and relatively unharmed. Except for her. There's no bounty on her head from what I know, so unlike the rest of you she's completely expendable. So how bout we get started. So I figure we'll start with one of the little fingers and we'll go from there. I don't really have anything sharp to cut it off cleanly, so we'll just sort of have to twist it off, is that okay. She doesn't know anything, Wexler! Leave her out of this! I believe you, I do. But that's not really the point. She doesn't have to know anything. She just has to feel pain. What about Commander Truffault? How are you gonna explain this to her? With any luck I'll never see Commander Truffault again. So you're not just screwing us, you're screwing Mikkei as well. Where are you gonna sell the device? Another corp? You got a better offer? That's not really any of your business, and anyway we've kind of getting off the topic here. I don't have a secret stash on some moon somewhere! I'm telling you the truth! Maybe, but I can't take your word for it. Now I've heard your rep, but I'm starting to think it's all just a bunch of talk. I don't think there's anything you'd rather do less than watch me hurt this girl. And anyway we'll know by the third finger for sure. Come on. We both know you're not gonna do that. We're thieves, we're not animals. Well, you know there are other things that Cain and I could do to her. Might even be more fun. Would you ah like to see that? You're a sick son of a bitch. Wexler, Cain, we've got a problem. What? You need to get to the bridge. Just as it was getting interesting. To be continued. I don't suppose you have that knife on you? Six has it. I'm tied too tight anyway. Yeah. I'm sorry about what happened to Two. I'm sorry you had to see that. I know she meant a lot to you. I don't think I was the only one. No you weren't. The ship was going through some kind of self-diagnostic when this came up. Something to do with the FTL drive but I can't... Here let me see. You understand all that? Of course. Well maybe not all of it. If the FTL drive is offline we can't jump. We can't jump we are screwed. The Volkov-Rusi will be here soon. Maybe they can help us. Or maybe they'll just take the device, keep the payment and leave us stranded. We can't trust them. We could re-activate the Android. It's too dangerous. What about the hostages? Maybe one of them can help. You know, the Android once told me that when all this caught up with us, I'd be the lucky one, because I wasn't one of the original crew. It's kinda funny how it turned out to be the exact opposite. Hey, I'm just gonna tell them I'm not the real Jace Corso. That'll make them back off. You'll never convince them. I've have the DNA scan. I'll make them believe me. And what good would that do? Then you'll just be expendable too. Look I'm not just gonna sit here and let them hurt you. I'd rather that than you sacrifice yourself for no reason. Please, please, just when they get back, keep your mouth shut. Sorry, I can't do it. You know you may not be one of the original crew, technically I'm not either, but you're definitely one of the bravest people on this ship. You're in luck, kid. Looks like you got a chance to prove you're not so expendable after all. Well? If I help you, and you get the drive back, what's to stop you from killing me? Oh no, no, no, no, no. See you're looking at this all wrong okay. If you help us and we get the drive back, then you'll have shown that you're useful enough to keep around. But if you don't, I definitely will kill you. Yeah, that's what I thought. What is it? We've had this problem before. One of the forward couplings has disengaged because it's detecting the possibility of a fatal overload. Can you fix it? A real fix would take a week in dry-dock, but we can make it work like we did before. Only thing is, someone has to go outside. Oh, that's rich. I'm not lying. Last time we sent the Android. I'll do it. Just tell me what I need to know. Seriously, how can he be sleeping at a time like this? Hey. He's conserving oxygen. You should be happy. There's only so much in here. There's nothing we can be doing right now anyways. To him, it's an efficient use of time. Sure, if you're a robot. He feels things same as you. He just doesn't show it. What happened to Two hit you pretty hard huh? Just caught me off guard is all. I didn't think they'd really do it. We all know there was something between you two. It's a small ship. It was only once. Didn't mean a thing. Uh huh. Before we went into those pods, there must have been times when we lost people right? Most likely. That's the life. And if you believe half of what people say about us, I'm guessing that we never let it slow us down. Ever. Maybe we really are different this time around. That's what she was hoping for. You okay? Where's Five? This button right here activates your mag boots. The coupling is located in a trench about fifty meters from the airlock. You good? Yeah. Alright we're gonna monitor your progress from the bridge. You got this. I hate kids. Ah, you can kill her when we're done here. Alright you're good to go. Okay, de-pressurizing. De-pressurization complete. Activating mag boots. And I'm opening the outer door. Alright, I'm outside. [Beeping] You know, I got to say... It's pretty beautiful out here. You can write a poem about it later. Get the job done. Understood. I can see the trench where the coupling's housed. It's directly ahead of me. What the hell? [Beeping] I'm losing air pressure! What are you talking about? [Gasping for air] My mag boots are deactivated! Can you identity where the breach is? [Gasping for air] He's off the ship! Vons, do you read me? Vons! [Intercom static] Do something! It's too late. What the hell just happened?! I don't know. [Beeping] That's impossible. What? Someone's pressurizing the airlock. Are you sure the prisoners are secure? Yes positive. I've got the door monitored from here. It's been locked the whole time. Who else is on this ship? No one. You're lying. Take her and put her with the others. Get down there and check the airlock. Now! That's far enough. You sent Vons out there. He volunteered. I was just trying to help. The whole thing was your idea. What did you do? What happened to him?! I don't know. I didn't do anything. Lying little bitch. You're supposed to be dead. Yeah, sorry to disappoint. [heavy breathing] I thought you were gone. Yeah yeah, so did I. What happened? When I figure it out, I'll tell you. Where are the others? They're still in the vault. Wexler's on the bridge and Cain went down to the airlock. Good, let's go, come on. You guys hear something? [banging on door] Guys! [banging on door] Door's too thick. How much air do you think they have left? I don't know. Not much. They changed the code. I'll get that code from Wexler one way or another. In the meantime, I want you to get into the vents, you find a safe hiding place and stay there. It's not a discussion, now go. 
 
 Wexler, you ain't gonna believe this. Tash is dead. What the hell are you talking about? Are you telling me that little girl managed to kill her? I don't know what happened, but she ain't just taking a nap. You find that little bitch, and when you do, you don't stop to chat, you just put one right in her brain. Do you understand me? Roger that. [ringing] This is the VRC Dimitriev. We have a shuttle inbound off your port side. Do you have the device? Yeah, we got it. Ah we just got a little bit of a situation here. Two teams, fan out. Is anyone else getting a little light-headed? The air is getting thin. We've got to make a plan, while we can still think straight. Hey, don't everybody talk at once. We're supposed to be good at this sort of thing. Some of us are, anyway. Hey! Huh. I'm in this as much as you are. Not really. What is that supposed to mean? If they turn us in, sooner or later the authorities will realize you're not the real Jace Corso, and when they do, they'll release you. He's got a point. We've got nothing to lose, but you sure as hell do. So when we make our move, you should just get down and stay down. You really think I'd do that? We're past the point of every man for himself. If we're gonna go down fighting, we're gonna do it together. Look, I know we've had our differences. Some of us more than others, but that's not important now. The Android's down. Two's dead. They've got Five. She's out there all by herself, helpless. It's up to us. Nobody's gonna do this for us. We have to do it ourselves. [gunshots] When they come through that door I say we take 'em down and we take 'em down hard. And we show them what the men of the Raza are made of. We may not have been able to help Two. But we can make the bastards pay. Damn straight! Nope. Ah, take it easy. Why don't you come have a seat for a minute. Yeah maybe just for a minute. Good speech, though. Even if it was mostly the hypoxia talking. [laughing] I heard gunfire. What the hell's going on down there? We've got men down. We're in pursuit. Son of a bitch. Hey, hey. You need to know I understand. I appreciate that. What? What are we talking about? Revenge. Revenge, for what they did to two. You want revenge. So do I. Turns out that we're not that different after all. I don't know. You know, I used to think that you didn't have it in you man, but no, that's not it. It's that you've never been in the position where you hate someone so much that you just wanna kill them. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Huh. That's far enough. Drop your weapon. I said, drop your weapon! I have never seen anyone survive being spaced before. That is quite a trick. Think you could survive a bullet between the eyes? I say we try it, and find out. [gun shots] Are you alright? I'm fine. Are you? Yeah. I'm sorry, I know I'm supposed to be hiding right now. I'm not gonna complain. Let's go. Wexler : Cain come in. Cain, goddamnit were the hell are you? Sergeant, report! Anybody! This is the Dimitriev. Wexler, what the hell is happening on that ship? Why aren't my men responding? I don't know. I think some of them might be down. Is this some kind of double cross? No, no, it's um, we're just having a little issue with the crew of the Raza that's all. You were supposed to have them locked down. I know. Don't worry. I can handle it. You sure about that? No, that's impossible, I killed you. You screwed that up, like everything else. Wexler, what's going on? Who is that? This is Portia Lin, commander of the Raza. We've re-taken the ship. If you want that device, you're gonna have to go through us to get it. What's it gonna be? [beeping] Guess they weren't looking for a fight. They just jumped to FTL. sh1t. Well now, we're all alone. You're gonna let me go. Am I? Yeah, that's right. You're gonna fly me to the nearest space station, and then when I'm safely off the ship I'll radio back with the code. Otherwise you'll just be letting them all suffocate. I've got a better idea. It seems like we've come full circle, doesn't it? You can threaten me all you like but we both know you can't kill me. Without the code your friends are dead. You're forgetting you're not the only one on this ship that knows how to open doors. Oh, the little girl? You must be kidding. She's my insurance policy. In case you decide to be difficult. She'll never crack that vault. You sure you want to take that chance? Because if she opens that door before you give me the code, you will regret it. I do not have to kill you quickly. If I give you the code you're just gonna blow me out anyway. Why? Because that's what you did to me? I'm nothing like you, Wexler. If you give me the code, I will let you out. Okay. It's 1040-99XD-4. It was my serial number in prison. You copy that? Got it. We're ready. Where are they? It's okay, we took care of them. It's over. Who's we? I got the door open. They're all pretty woozy, but I think they're going to be okay. Who you talking to? Okay, I did my part. Now it's your turn. Hey, you said you were gonna let me out. Hey, quit screwing around. Alright, you're not a cold blooded killer. You're not like me, remember? After today, I don't know what I am. When does this headache go away? Could be a while. What about Two? I didn't hallucinate that, did I? She got blown out the airlock. Yeah. She said she was pushed out toward the front of the ship, but she managed to grab onto a raised section of the hull. She held on, waiting to die, and she didn't. She pulled herself down into one of the trenches that house the forward couplings, disengaged one of them so that ship wouldn't jump. Then she pushed herself toward the airlock, and waited for them to open the door. All that, without a space suit? Apparently. What the hell is she? As far as I can tell, you're an advanced bio-synthetic organism. What does that mean? You weren't born, you were engineered. What, like you? No, not like me. You have a heart, lungs, kidneys, fluids. But your constituent parts were manufactured, to exact specifications, and then assembled. You also have a network of corrector nanites moving throughout your body, even more advanced than my own. They're designed to migrate quickly to any area of need. Like when I was bitten. It killed the virus. Correct. And healed the wound itself. I believe that when you were exposed to the cold of space, the nanites migrated to your skin, joined together and formed a protective shield. It couldn't have been more than a few microns thick, but it kept you alive. Very impressive. You knew? I had my suspicions. Why didn't you say anything. You didn't ask. I had no idea this technology even existed. It doesn't, officially. And it's in contravention of all G.A. regulations regarding the manufacture of artificial persons. If the authorities were to learn of your existence, it is likely you would be hunted down and destroyed. So what do we do with this thing now? Complete the delivery, get paid, what else? I don't think we should deliver this guys. Whatever this thing is, three corporations were willing to kill for it. I'm thinking it's something that's extremely dangerous. All the more reason to get it off the ship. Yeah. Maybe we should ask Two what she thinks. What, we're not gonna trust her now? Because she's not who we thought she was? Welcome to the goddamn club. The device is online, activating field, ten percent. Pleasure doing business with you. Likewise. This is interesting. We're getting some unusual readings from the planet's surface. What the hell was that? The field's become unstable. Shut it down. Oh my god. The planet's gravitational field is fluctuating wildly. We need to leave, immediately. Marauder, what's your position? We're just docking now. Can we jump? The field variance is making nav calculations impossible. Maximum sublight, now! The planet is breaking up. Divert all available power to the engines! What the hell's going on? Let's go. We're clear of the field. I'm dialing back the engines. The planet has been destroyed.
