 Previously on Dark Matter"... 
 Who are you? 
 We all woke up just like you, no memories, no idea who we are or how we got here. 
 No one stole our memories. It was an accident. 
 No, it wasn't. Who are you? What the hell are you doing with my face? That's the program you wrote that wiped all our memories. Then why? I think you were trying to protect someone. We've just been darked. [electricity crackles] [coughing] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [mechanical whirring] [tense music] What is this place? No idea. What happened to us? I don't know. Last thing I remember was being on our ship. [alarm blares] Strip down. Let's go. Clothes off, now. Let's go. Move it. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Stand by for decontamination. I hate this part. [humming noise] [all shouting] Argh! Oh! Ahh! Decontamination complete. Stand by. [door hissing] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [alarm blaring] [door hissing] [indistinct shouting] ♪ ♪ [energy surging] [rock music] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] Five? Hey. Hey. [gasps] Hey. Are you okay? My head is pounding. Mine too. Where are we? What happened? I don't know. We were on the ship. I remember that. I mean, we were all... We were pointing guns at each other. Right. Someone sold us out. I thought it was Three. You... you thought it was Two. Three thought it was you. Six! What the hell? My real name is Lieutenant Kal Varrick, Galactic Authority, Special Investigations Unit. Oh, my God. What? It was you. [somber music] What is this place? Hyperion-8, Galactic Maximum Security Detention Facility. You're in the staff wing. Where are the others? ♪ ♪ [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ You know... a girl like you in a place like this, you'll do okay... if you're nice to the right people. ♪ ♪ I don't get it. This doesn't make sense. I was a GA undercover agent tasked with bringing you all in. So you were lying to us this whole time? No, I had no idea until I went after The General. I was approached by what I thought was one of his men, who told me he was an undercover agent and that I was too. Apparently, I infiltrated The General's organization, but after The General blew up Hyadum-12,  I lost it. [gunshots] Uh! [dramatic music] The GA pulled me out and put me on medical leave. But eventually, they gave me a new assignment. The "Raza." Of course, I didn't believe them at first, but he said he's send me proof. Just shut up. When I got back to the ship, I logged on, and there it was, my personnel file, my real name. [sighs] It was all true. I was torn. I didn't know what to do. Just... just stop talking. I was a cop, sworn to uphold the law. And after that planet was destroyed... Shut up! [smack] We trusted you. We were your friends. The two of you still are. I'm sorry. I mean, I don't regret what I did. It had to be done. I just wish you didn't have to get hurt. Well, it's too late. Look, we ran your DNA. We found your real identities. I already know. My name's Derrick Moss. I ran a DNA scan after we used transfer transit. [tense music] What about you? You want to know your real name? What I want to know is what's gonna happen to us... all of us. Well, the GA's still trying to figure out what to do with you two. But the others will have to stay in general population until we can arrange their trial. Do they know what Two is? Did you tell them? No. And as long as she keeps her nose clean, it shouldn't matter. You don't seriously believe that, do you? Sooner or later, they're gonna find out. She has to answer for her crimes, and so do the others. But as long as you two cooperate, you'll be fine. You mean you want us to testify against them. Don't say another word. Who are you? Felicia Brand, this man's attorney, and this is a court order demanding his immediate release. ♪ ♪ Congratulations, Lieutenant Varrick. Those arrests... they're a real feather in your cap. That's not why I did it. If you say so. One of your prisoners, Portia Lin... I think it might be a good idea if you kept her in isolation, at least for a while. And why's that? She's unstable. She could cause you some trouble. Well, that's an accurate description of just about everyone in the place, including some of the guards. So what? Is there something I should know? Well, you have my recommendation. Duly noted. Oh, and thank you so much for trying to tell me how to do my job. It's greatly appreciated. ♪ ♪ Sorry about this place. It was the best we could find on short notice. It... it seems pretty okay to me. Oh. Look, about that girl... I don't know her real name, but we called her Five. I'm sorry, as your lawyer, I need to advise you to distance yourself from those people. Those people are my friends. They're criminals. You need to stop worrying about them and start thinking about your future. Now, I found a decent plastic surgeon. He can put you back to the way you were before you go in front of the board. It... it might help. ♪ ♪ This is the only face I remember. There's something else. I want to see the police files on my wife's murder. ♪ ♪ [loud buzzing] Section five, chow and rec. One hour. Move! Let's go! Sweet. Well, look who it is, Marcus Boone. It's been a while. Should I know you guys? Right, the amnesia thing. Another con. Not this time. You may not remember us, but we definitely remember you. Fellas, I am not looking for any trouble, all right? You should've thought of that when you screwed us out of our cut of that bank job on Vellis Nine. Give me a break, anyone could just waltz in here and say that I owe them money. That's ridiculous. Ugh! You do owe us a lot of money. But we'll start with something small, like, say, your ration card. [whispering] Wait. Don't I need that to eat? Your problem. [gagging] [clears throat] Stay out of this, Nyx. I'm sorry, boys. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to move on. Yeah. [coughs, gasps] This isn't over. Impressive. I guess I should thank you, huh? No, but you can pay me. Pay you? I'll take your ration card. That's what they were asking for. I could've just given it to them. Well, now you can just give it to me. [pummeling] [smack] Uh! Is this how you make new friends? [tense music] ♪ ♪ [smack] [punch] [both grunting] Uh! [pummeling] ♪ ♪ You're pretty good. Likewise. Want to call it a draw? No chance. [zapping] Okay, okay, I'll come quietly. There's no need to use that thing on me. You kidding? [zapping] It's the highlight of my day. ♪ ♪ [mechanical whirring] All right, ship's android, model 6641619-8. That's me. You have a record of your sensory inputs, yes? Everything you say and do, everything you see and hear? Of course. How far back? From the moment I was reactivated in the infirmary, 47 days, 8 hours, and 14 minutes. Although there are some gaps. Yeah, we'll worry about that later. Right now, I need you to link to my server and upload your files. I can't. Uh, why not? I mean, I know you're an older model... Let me rephrase. I won't. [scoffs] Excuse me? I said I won't. You've been impounded, just like the ship. You're GA property now, so you will cooperate. No. I won't. [sighs] Obsolete tech is the worst. First the base programming breaks down, then eventually, the entire system is corrupt. Okay, fine, fine. We'll do it the hard way. I'll upload a recovery program and extract the files myself. If you do that, you'll trigger a security protocol that will scramble my entire neural network. I'll become inoperable and require a full reboot. All data will be lost. Including your personality matrix. True... regrettably. I got orders, okay? If I don't get these files, it's my head on a platter. That seems unlikely. But okay. [beeping] Better? Yeah. Better. [grunts] You figured it out? Hmm? Are you talking to me? Not so bad in here, is it? Better food, better view... Yeah. The catch is, you got to get hurt. That's the trick. What are you talking about? Got to know the right kind of injuries... the ones that give you maximum time for minimum pain. Radiation burn, not life-threatening, but requires a lot of therapy. Bought me five days. Wait, you're telling me you did that to yourself? That's crazy, man. Is it? Who's the guy? That's Devon. He a prisoner? Oh, yeah. But he's got medical training, so they let him do his work detail in here. Lucky b*st*rd. [gasping] You held your own against Nyx. Not bad. Where am I? Solitary. Can't have fighting in my prison. She was attacking my friend. Yeah, she does that. Enjoy. W-wait. How long am I in here? Well, that depends. How long does it take you to learn a lesson? [door slams] [melancholy music] ♪ ♪ [soft buzz] [melancholy music] ♪ ♪ Derrick. Is that really you? Um, who are you? Oh, of course. You wouldn't know. My name is Darius. I'm acting Chief Executive Officer of Corelactic Industries. My father's company. Your company now. May I? I came as soon as I could. My personal transport is in orbit, waiting to take you home. There's some GA red tape to deal with first, but it's nothing that Felicia can't handle. So you're the one who sent her. Of course. I know you don't remember this, but I worked with your father for 30 years. I watched you grow up. And when he told me that he was leaving you the company, I swore that I'd do everything in my power to help you. If there's anything you need... Yeah, actually, there is something. I've been doing some research, going over the police files on my wife's murder. Ah, a real tragedy. She was a beautiful woman. Yeah, but the thing is, the only evidence they have against Marcus Boone is the testimony of the security guard, the one who supposedly gave him the access code to the building. A former employee. Always a bitter pill when you're betrayed by one of your own. Yeah, except that Boone's record is full of stuff like mercenary work, hijacking, weapons shipments, taking down corporate freighters... small time B&E, not so much. What are you getting at? Maybe it's nothing, but I'd like to talk to that security guard. Derrick, I can assure you that I was informed at every step of the investigation, and there's no doubt in my mind... Can you just find him, please? Shouldn't be too hard. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, I'm fine. ♪ ♪ 
 
 You need to come with us. I'm eating. He wants to see you. Who? Come with us and find out. No. Meal time's over for you. Make your move. Not here. sh1t goes down in here, and they take down the whole block. I'm curious. How exactly do they take down a whole block? There's currently one guard watching us right now, and he seems preoccupied. You're a real dumbass, you know that? [punch] [indistinct shouting] sh1t. Code black. Cell block one, code black. I got you, cell block one. Code black. [high-pitched ringing] [mechanical whirring] Where the hell did you get that? Where do you think? That ship's in orbit, quarantined until the forensic team can get here. I know that, but you didn't really think I would leave this behind, did you? Anyway, I fixed it. The battery wasn't charging properly. Now it's as good as new. Relax, have a drink. No, thanks. You're gonna need it. What? We just got word. The trial's been postponed indefinitely. It's a jurisdictional nightmare. Everyone and their grandmother's been filing for extradition. That shouldn't matter. The GA takes precedence. Well, there may be a little more to it than that. What are you talking about? Word is, Ferrous is pushing hard for a quick trial, but someone else is pushing back. Who? You tell me. You know more about what happened on that ship than anyone. You need to be careful. The last thing you want to be is a pawn in some corporate political battle. They'll squash you like a bug. This is supposed to be about justice. I hate to be the one to say this, but justice left the building a long time ago. ♪ ♪ [buzzing] I was wondering if you'd try it. Most newbs try it till they realize how crappy it is. Where are we? Sim yard. [sighs] So it's not real. Of course not. It's a way for prisoners who have shown violent tendencies to interact without any risks. We could tear each other apart in here, and it wouldn't matter. Why is it so cold? Warden's idea of a little joke. It could just as easily be a tropical beach somewhere, but this is what we get. I'm sorry about your friend. I wasn't gonna take his ration card. I was just testing him. Really? The whole prison's been talking about you. The crew of the "Raza," the most badass of them all, supposedly. You were disappointed? I didn't expect much from Boone. He's a man. They're all the same. Meaning they underestimate you. Well, it's not his fault. He was born stupid. You, on the other hand, come exactly as advertised. You're a good fighter. So are you. Surprisingly good. [dark music] ♪ ♪ [door whirs] [electronic beeping] What the hell? ♪ ♪ Oh, it's you. How you doing? I'm okay, I guess. Considering. I suppose I should thank you for the tablet, the books. Right now, it's the only thing keeping me from going crazy in here. Well, if you're looking for something to occupy your mind... What's that? It's a coded file. I was hoping you'd crack it for me. You want my help? Seriously? Look, I know you think I betrayed you... You did betray us! Okay, maybe I did. But my intention was to help you. It still is. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Your real name is Emily Kolburn. You're 16 years old. Your parents died in a shuttle accident when you were a baby. You grew up in an orphanage. You ran away at age 12, and you've been living on the streets ever since. You're a survivor. And you'll survive this. ♪ ♪ I spoke to Felicia this morning. After a little arm-twisting, it looks like the GA is finally ready to drop those absurd charges. Your transit papers should come through any day now. What about that security guard? Did you find him? I thought Felicia told you. Told me what? He's dead. Some kind of altercation in a bar last night. He didn't exactly move in polite society. What happened? I don't have the details. And anyway, what does it matter? It's time for you to put this all behind you. It's time for you to come home. ♪ ♪ [tense music] [door hisses] ♪ ♪ Ryo Tetsuda, AKA Ryo Ishida. What am I gonna do with you? Who are you? You can call me Arax. You know, that stunt you pulled is causing me a lot of headaches. The Warden's furious, and he wants me to hand over the instigator. Now, if I did, he'd put you in solitary for six months. Halfway through, you'd be smearing your sh1t all over the walls, and by the end, you'd be gibbering like a lobotomized toddler. I've seen it happen. If you were going to hand me over, you would've done it already. You obviously brought me here for a reason. No, thanks. Mmm. You and your friends are new here. You need to understand the way things work. The warden likes it quiet... by the book. It looks good on his quarterly reports. So I make sure it stays that way. And in exchange, you get certain benefits. Which I can pass along to anyone who cooperates. Everyone wins. Especially you. Those men with the tattoos... they a part of this? They made their own separate arrangement. We try to stay out of each other's way, but you may have screwed that up too. It was necessary to test the response to a chaotic situation. Mm. And what did you think? Interesting. Sonic disabler. The guards all wear these little earpieces that nullify the effect. If they want, they can broadcast it through the entire prison, taking down every single inmate in seconds. It's very effective. But not foolproof. ♪ ♪ You see, this is exactly what I was talking about. You think you're some hotshot mercenary that's better than the rest of us common crooks. No one has ever escaped from this place. If you try, you'll just get yourself killed, and the rest of us will be put in lockdown for a month. And you just might lose your special arrangement. You and your friends are going to toe the line. Or what? Or you're going to regret it. ♪ ♪ [spurting] [sighs] How's the food? Seriously? Hmm. No time to eat anyway. You got laundry. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [steam hissing] [soft buzz] Well, this is unexpected. Can I come in? Nice. Being a wealthy industrialist has its perks. Although, to be honest, after a while, it starts to feel like its own kind of prison. Trust me, this is better. So just so you know, Five's gonna be okay. The GA's not gonna pursue charges. Good. You know I had to do it, right? You want a drink? Yes, please. So I hear you're going back to your old life. That's good. Can't complain. Everything anyone could possibly want is supposedly waiting out there for me. Something just doesn't feel right. What do you mean? You read my file. You know what happened to my wife. Yeah, looks like Boone killed her. Yeah, according to the testimony of one witness. But the second I start asking questions, that witness turns up dead. That's a mighty big coincidence. Who else knew you were asking these questions? The CEO of my father's company. He says he's loyal. He says he's on my side, but if I go back, I take his place. [dramatic music] Maybe there's something to it. Or maybe you've just spent too much time on that ship. It's made you paranoid. No. If anything, it's woken me up. Made me realize the dangers of being too trusting. ♪ ♪ I brought you something. When you came out of stasis, you had no memory, but you knew the right thing to do because you are who you are. Never forget that. ♪ ♪ [chuckling] Boom! Ha-ha! [groans] [sizzling] [screaming] You manage to crack the file? Yeah. Yeah, I did. So what is it? You're not gonna like it. ♪ ♪ [ominous music] ♪ ♪ It's a pretty nasty burn. Yeah. Must've not been paying attention to what you were doing. First time I ever operated one of those things, so... just got distracted. What happened to the nurse from yesterday? Just transferred out. Stress leave. What about the old guy? Supposed to be here a couple more days. Who, Charlie? Yeah, he was a frequent visitor. Turns out his wounds were self-inflicted, so the warden had him transferred over to the psyche wing. He'll be getting steady doses of electric shock therapy now. Oh. How's that feel? Move it around. It's all good. Send me back. You sure? Burn protocol says I keep you here a minimum of 24 hours. No, I'm fine. Sheets aren't gonna fold themselves, right? Hey, that's a positive attitude. I'll be sure and include that in my report. Okay. [buzzing] I was hoping you'd come back. It's cold, and it's miserable, but it's a lot better than that cell. Listen. I hear you and your friends were never sentenced. You never even got a trial. Yeah, that's right. I take it that's not normal procedure. I've been in the system for years, and I've never seen it before. They're scared of you. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Even if we had a trial, they would find us guilty. We are guilty. So that's it? You're just gonna give up, spend the rest of your life here? Do I have a choice? I wonder. [slam] Whoa! What the hell? Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? The GA knew about the plan to bomb Hyadum-12, and they let it happen. Oh, you got to be kidding me. They let those people die so they could turn public opinion against the rebels. Yeah, and they also got a big injection of cash from the Corporations to help with the fight. Why didn't you tell me? I did tell you! Don't you get it? We've had this conversation before. You just don't remember. When? You were on sick leave. I came to visit you. I thought you deserved to know, so I told you. You told me the truth? About the bomb? Yeah, you were pissed off. Hell, you nearly broke my jaw. But I... I went back to work. Of course you did, because you realized there was no other choice. This is their game, and we are just their soldiers. We don't push back. Like hell we don't. [tense music] ♪ ♪ That's it. You're out. That was two days. Cross the line again, and it's two weeks. Look who's back. How was solitary? Interesting. Mm-hmm? What happened to your hand? It's a long story. Look at the wallflower. [sighs] Well, look at us. All together again, just like old times. So what have we learned? About what? About how things work around here. Please don't tell me you've been playing cards this entire time. I haven't been playing cards this entire time. Just... in fact, I thought I figured out a way to game the system to get special privileges... you know, like time off work detail or better food. And? Turns out, not so much. At least I tried. How about you? I tested the prison's riot protocol. It was necessary to evaluate the guards' response time and technique. They use a powerful sonic blast to disable everyone in the area. And those earpieces the guards all wear... they filter out the frequency, so they're unaffected. Interesting. Mm-hmm. Do you think your nanites would protect you from something like that? I don't know. How fast does it work? Virtually instantaneous. I don't know if they'd keep me from feeling the effects, but they might help me recover faster. That's good to know. Well, we've done our jobs. What about you, Boss? Please tell me that you did not make friends with her. She's mean. I think she might be useful. How? She didn't want to tell me too much, but I get the sense that she might know a way out of here. Seriously? There's one more thing you should know. The guards won't be the only ones we need to worry about. The boss of one of the prison gangs warned me against doing anything that might cause trouble. [sighs] So they'll be watching us. Great. Just make the impossible job a little harder. We just need to be careful with who we speak to. Mm-hmm. [dramatic music] So are we doing this thing? Hmm? I mean, we're really gonna try to escape from the inescapable prison on a moon with no atmosphere? We're the crew of the "Raza." You're damn right we're doing it. ♪ ♪ You wanted to see me? We just got the call. It's on. Make the arrangements. Girl might be tricky if we can't put her in Gen Pop. We're transferring her planet-side. It'll be dealt with on the other end. She's just a kid. Here's the thing about kids, Herv... they grow up to become adults. What about the one who lawyered up... Moss? It's out of our hands. Somebody else's problem now. Got it. ♪ ♪ [engine whirring] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ It's your lucky day, Kid. Your transfer just came through. Transfer where? You're being placed in a group home down on the planet. A group home? I know it's not ideal, but it's just temporary. I don't want to go. Well, that's a first one for me. I never heard a prisoner say they wanted to stay here before. [sighs] Just... just put me in the general population. At least I'd be with my friends. That's no place for you. My place was on that ship. But you made sure that that would never happen again, didn't you? Okay, you know the really funny thing is? You think you actually get a say. Come on, let's go. Let go of me! You want to get cuffed and shackled, you keep it up. Don't. [somber music] ♪ ♪ Why are you letting them do this? I'm trying to help you. No, you're trying to help yourself by sending me away to be someone else's problem. I'm an inconvenience. You can say that again. Just get her on the shuttle. I'm afraid I have to countermand that order. Who are you? Commander Shaddick, chief inspector of the Galactic Authority's Serious Crimes division. That girl's not going anywhere. I was told she wasn't gonna face any new charges. And she won't, if she cooperates with my investigation. Effective immediately, you have been relieved of your duties. This case is mine now. [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ [soft buzz] I'm ready. Long time, no see. [gunshots] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪
