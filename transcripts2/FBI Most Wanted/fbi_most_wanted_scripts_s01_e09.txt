 Emma Cain is picking up where her husband, Tyler Cain, left off. 
 An hour ago, she walked into Iglesia De Santa Maria in Saugerties and killed 12 women. 
 Wounded 13 others. Some were pregnant, some were undocumented, all were Latinx. 
 She told her victims, and I quote, "Y'all are taking over my country." 
 We ought to smack her with Woody Guthrie's guitar. 
 CID just jumped her to the top of Most Wanted. 
 Accomplices? 
 Church secretary said she came alone along with a donation of baby supplies. 
 There were no cameras outside, so we crapped out on any video of her vehicle. 
 This just dropped on YouTube. 
 Today, the first blow was struck in the name of white America. 
 The time for games is over. 
 Last night, my beautiful white husband, Tyler Cain, was assassinated by Muslim agent of the mongrel government of the colored states. 
 Wake up, white people! 
 Wake and rise. 
 We are superior. This is just a fact. 
 Seize our destiny. 
 Clear out the mud, and take out the land that God has granted the white race. 
 She thinks her husband's dead. 
 As soon as Cain's out of surgery, we need to release a proof of life video before she makes a martyr out of him. 
 Why even bother? 
 He'll say it's a deep fake and ignore it. 
 Can't use facts to fight fanatics. 
 Fanatics with a million dollars. 
 You're right. 
 She might've done this out of anger, but this is a sideshow. 
 A tragic one, but a sideshow nonetheless. 
 The main attraction is what her group hopes to buy with a million bucks. 
 We could be looking at a mass casualty event. 
 All right, get out to the Cain residents. 
 We know our jobs, so let's do them. 
 Listen, Jess, we heard about your daughter. 
 Yeah, it's a screwup. Some overzealous ICE agent. 
 If it were one of my kids... 
 Believe me, I'm gonna kick somebody's butt from here to Sunday. Yeah. 
 Whatever you need to do to find her, you go. 
 We'll cover. I appreciate that. 
 So Tyler likes model trains, and Emma likes quilting. 
 It's what kills me about terrorists. 
 Domestic, Islamic, whatever, all of their hobbies are super boring. 
 Well, they get enough thrills from their side job. 
 These two got around. 
 Tiki torch parade in Charlottesville. 
 We got the white nationalist rally in Oregon, The Unite the Right March in DC. 
 Any word on Tali? 
 They said they'd call me tonight, tell me where to pick her up. 
 We'll see. Anything here? 
 Just your run-of-the-mill racist swag. 
 Whatever prepping they did, they kept the place pretty sterile. 
 Jess, I'm sorry about what's going on with your daughter. 
 ICE lost my Aunt Yara for three days when she immigrated here. 
 Had her logged in as a man, but it all worked out. 
 She takes her citizenship oath on Monday. 
 Good on Yara. 
 Interesting selection from the very white book club. 
 "Fascinating Womanhood." 
 It's anti-feminist screed from the '70s. 
 Check this out. 
 "Women should stay home, have babies, cook and clean for their men." 
 Nowadays of course, they call themselves tradwives and aspire to making white pristine babies. 
 "Home is not a place, it's a calling." 
 And Emma's living her dream. 
 Emma's got children on her mind. 
 Red clover. 
 Chasteberry. 
 When we were trying to get pregnant, Charlotte made tea with this stuff. 
 Said it boosted her fertility. 
 We talked to Roger Jameson about the ransom he paid on his kid. 
 The only person he dealt with was a woman on the phone. 
 He identified Emma Cain's voice off her YouTube video. 
 Actually he said it was probably her. 
 Don't oversell the ID. It's not a stock. 
 Don't wanna undersell it either. 
 So the drop was at Hasbrouck Park in New Paltz. 
 Left a million bucks in a bag under a bench, took a spin around the park, and when he came back, presto, son was sitting there on the bench waiting for him. 
 We're doing a 360 pull on all video in the area. 
 It's the hospital. 
 Tyler Cain is out of surgery. 
 Supervisor Stevens, please. It's Jess LaCroix. 
 Right. 
 Yeah, tell him I'm still waiting for his call. 
 They told me Emma killed 12 mamacitas. 
 Booyah. 
 I know you. You're that Arab who shot me. 
 I bet you're sorry that you didn't kill me. 
 No, it's fine. 
 I'll make up for it when I put your wife down. 
 Unless I get to her first. 
 Of course, with your help, maybe we can get her to turn herself in before she hurts anyone else. 
 Assuming you actually care about her. 
 You're playing me. 
 These mud people think they can play me. 
 Nobody's playing you. We'll kill her if we have to. 
 She probably already flew the coup. 
 Probably on the beach in a bikini somewhere in the southern hemisphere with your ransom money. 
 Mmm, laughing at the poor cuck doing life. 
 That's what you think the money's for? 
 You're gonna be surprised. 
 So why don't you tell us what it's for? 
 She'd be quite a catch, your Emma. 
 She might even meet a guy who could give her those babies she always wanted. 
 The ones you couldn't give her. 
 Are you gonna let her get away with that? 
 You think I give a rat's ass about that!? 
 We're stopping the white genocide! 
 Your mongrel schools, your mixed churches... nothing's safe anymore. 
 All of this vermin invading our white Christian country, wanting to replace us? 
 Their day of reckoning is coming. 
 The race war is on, and my Emma... 
 She just blew freakin' Reveille! 
 Schools and churches. That really narrows down the targets. 
 Don't know about you, but I can let the n-word roll off, but there's something about "mud people" that just sticks in my craw. 
 LaCroix. 
 Where? Thank you. 
 They found her. 
 The detention facility in Long Island was filled up, so the detainees from the food bank raid were transported here. 
 She's in dorm C. This way. 
 Dorms? Last dorms I was in had beds. 
 This gentleman is here for his daughter. 
 Tali. Tali! 
 Tali, it's your dad! 
 That's not my daughter. 
 That's her. That's her picture. 
 Have you seen her? I haven't seen her. 
 Estoy buscando. 
 Estoy buscando a mi hija. 
 Sir. She's not here. 
 What do you mean, she's not here? 
 Por favor. Por favor. 
 The little American girl? Yes. 
 When we came to this place, they put her in a van. 
 An immigration van. 
 They took her away. 
 They what? 
 They took her away. 
 Hey! You come on... 
 Where's my daughter, you lying son of a bitch? 
 I got him. 
 I don't know what happened to your girl. 
 I never seen her! Come on. 
 This place is a hellhole. 
 You should be ashamed of yourself! 
 Jess, come on! 
 I don't know what happened, Mr. LaCroix. 
 My information said she was at the facility. 
 That's what the field report said. 
 Admit it. You lost my daughter. 
 You have no idea where she is. 
 That's not exactly true. The agency knows where she is. 
 I have no doubt she's on our books. 
 That's not very comforting. You need to get on the stick, or I'm gonna open up a kidnapping case. 
 You have one hour. 
 He's in over his head. We gotta try something else. 
 I think I have a hook that can help. 
 Lemme see what I can shake loose. 
 Here's a video from the money drop. 
 Emma leaving the park with the ransom. 
 Registered to a Bob Carter in Stone Ridge, New York. 
 Let's move. 
 There's a secondary structure. 
 Grab the cutters. Clear! 
 Where's your truck, Mr. Carter? 
 My son Joey has it. 
 Went ice fishing with some friends at Saranac Lake. 
 Then what was your truck doing in New Paltz yesterday, huh? 
 I don't know. 
 Who's is this? Oh, that's Joey. 
 Are these his too? Yeah, yeah. 
 He loves working on the truck. He collects the antique plates. 
 It's a phone number with a Miami area code. 
 6:30. Could be some kind of meetup. 
 Who's handwriting is this? Joey. 
 What did he do anyway? 
 Your son was involved in a kidnapping by a white supremacist terrorist cell. 
 Wh... white supremacist? No, not my boy. 
 I mean, I was at Woodstock. I didn't raise no racist. 
 Is that right? 
 The numbers on these plates... 88, 14. 
 You know what those stand for? No. 
 Those are code. 
 88. 
 Eighth letter of the alphabet. H, H. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 14. 
 Code for the 14 word slogan. 
 "We must secure the existence of our people, and a future for white children." 
 Your son's racist, pops. 
 I got a call back from my connect at homeland security. 
 She's got intel on the foodbank raid. 
 Unhook him. 
 Your daughter's not in the detainee database. 
 That's not unusual for someone who's been in custody 24 hours. 
 System's garbage. 
 You get no argument from me. 
 Clint told me you've been dealing with the supervisor, Stevens. 
 The raid order was actually signed for two weeks ago by his predecessor Gerald Waldon. 
 Why'd they target a foodbank in the middle of nowhere? 
 The order referenced an ongoing county-wide investigation. 
 Here, it mentions affidavits by Suffolk County law enforcement. 
 But I couldn't find any other affidavits or supporting documents in the ERO database. 
 Can you go back to the list of files? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So when was the order dated? 
 January 27th. 27th... 
 And then right here it says it was created February 6th. 
 That's three days ago. I hadn't noticed that. 
 And then Waldon's signature is an automatic signature. 
 Anybody could've posted that. 
 He had access to Waldon's computer. 
 Which Stevens had. 
 Son of a bitch backdated the order to cover his tracks. 
 You want me to open up a case on Stevens now? 
 Look, hold off for now, but if you don't mind putting an alert in your system for my daughter, that'd be great. 
 The moment she pops up in the ICE database, I'll know. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks, Zoey. 
 I wanna drive over to Stevens' office and rip his scrawny throat out, but it might come back on Tali. 
 Got to find out who we're dealing with first. 
 Then you can rip his throat out. 
 Hey. 
 The phone number found on the envelope we found at Joey Carter's place belongs to a Mark Vasco. 
 Two convictions for gun running, one of which includes selling a crate of stole AKs to an undercover ATF agent. 
 And now he's putting guns in the hands of white supremacists. 
 He'll sell to all-comers. 
 Maybe that's where Emma's spending her million bucks. 
 We find Vasco, we find Emma. 
 I want warrants on all his devices. 
 I need you to check something out for me. 
 What happens when you cross-search Tali's name with Island Garden Foodbank? 
 You think someone's targeting her? 
 Maybe. 
 She comes up in the foodbank newsletter, and her friend's Instagram. 
 I told her to be more careful about what she puts out there. 
 Her bad for being 11 and having friends. 
 I know. 
 This piece of crap, Austin Stevens, turn him inside out. 
 Gladly. 
 She's good to go. 
 If this is what you say it is, we'll find you. 
 I haven't had a disappointed customer yet. 
 Come on, Greg! 
 My nips are freezing. 
 Tell Mary Lou we're gonna find that little girl. 
 It's just a matter of time. 
 Thanks, Nelson. Appreciate it. 
 Won't let you down. 
 Hey, boss. You okay? 
 Yeah. What is it? 
 Vasco's phone pinged three hours ago at a private airfield in Milford, Connecticut. 
 That phone went dead five minutes later right when a GPS in a car registered to a Greg Rankin left that airfield heading west. 
 Who's Greg Rankin? 
 He did a bid at the Coleman Correctionals for firearm violations... same time as Vasco. 
 Now, Rankin drove to Danberry. 
 Now, at 6:30... you know, that time on the envelope, he was at this location off of Eagle Road for 20 minutes. 
 I found six pairs of fresh footprints, and two sets of fresh tire tracks. 
 One consistent with a Ford Raptor, and the other consistent with a sedan. 
 Anybody check that dumpster? Not yet. 
 Nice quiet place for a gun deal. 
 This isn't good. 
 Got a remote control car. 
 The remote's missing. 
 They pulled the receiver out of the car. 
 You can use that to trigger a bomb. 
 Must've been what Vasco sold them. 
 Explosives. 
 Probably Semtex. 
 And the expertise to put it together. 
 You get a gnarly bang for a million bucks. 
 All right, so targets include anywhere Tyler or Cain visited in the last six months. They're thinking big. 
 Boston, New York, transportation hubs, airports, trains. Right. 
 Places where immigrants gather. 
 That seems to be Emma's sore spot. 
 Greg Rankin was just picked up at the Mohegan Sun casino. 
 He's lawyered up, he's not talking... looks like he was playing blackjack with $50,000 in chips. 
 Had another $50,000 in cash in his suitcase. 
 They discovered traces of Semtex on his clothes. 
 A pound of Semtex will set you back 1,800 bucks on the black market. 
 Assuming Emma kept some walking around money, they could've bought up to 400 pounds of it from Vasco. 
 We also checked the airfield in Milford. 
 Vasco was wheels up about an hour ago, so we'll have to pinch him when he lands in Miami. 
 I doubt Emma shared our target with him. 
 And if I were him... 
 I wouldn't wanna... 
 Jess? 
 "Your little mutt is in the system. 
 "She can be deported any time. 
 "If you want to see her again, you and your Mexican boss, "Isobel Castille, "are gonna call a press conference 
 "in the next six hours, and you, Agent LaCroix, "are gonna read our manifesto on the air. 
 "Do exactly what we say, "or your mutt's gonna end up in a slum in Guatemala getting jumped in by MS-13." 
 What's the manifesto? 
 It's a call to arms for white America. 
 The Cains are accelerationists. 
 They wanna speed up the forces of chaos and anarchy to cause a breakdown, and they wanna use us to legitimize and magnify the threat of insurgency. 
 Juice up the public, inspire other crackpots. 
 All right, send this to me. 
 It's my daughter they're holding hostage. 
 I can read their screed. It's just words. 
 We can refute at the moment we get Tali back. 
 Viviero's done this before. 
 I have to take it up with the director. 
 Emma Cain shot pregnant women at point blank range without batting an eye. Jess... 
 Before the director says no, you ask him if he'd have his kids change places with mine! 
 I understand that, but we have protocol. 
 Look, I... I know we don't give in to terrorists, but... 
 If we can't protect our own, what good are we? 
 My place is 15 minutes from here. 
 Yeah? Where's your car? 
 Home. I came her straight from work. 
 Are you a janitor? Is that problem? 
 No. I like my men tidy. 
 Especially like men in tidy whities. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Oh. Oh, 'scuse me. 
 Sorry. Let me get this for you. 
 Ooh, why thank you. 
 We're gonna have some good clean fun. 
 "The FBI called the White Identity Movement 
 "the number one threat to the American way of life. 
 "A way of life that includes open borders, "white genocide, "invasions by inferior races. 
 "But those days are over now. 
 "Your army... 
 Your army of crusaders"... 
 I can't do it. That's all. 
 The people who wrote this are cowards. 
 They're holding my daughter, my 11-year-old daughter, hostage. 
 An innocent girl. 
 Anybody who believes this crap, who encourages this... 
 They're not good people. 
 Cowards. 
 Zoey says they checked the detention facilities in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey. 
 Tali's not in any of them. They'll expand the search. 
 I spoke with the director, and I told him that no one is beating himself up over this more than you. 
 Bottom line is he's giving you a pass on your performance. 
 I'm not worried about me. 
 I'm worried about what they might do to Tali because of what I said. 
 There are 34,000 professionals working in the FBI to keep her and everybody else safe from those cowards. 
 That's a family you can count on. 
 Jess. 
 I can't imagine how you felt standing in front of those cameras. 
 If it was my Anais in danger... 
 You would've done it. You would've tried. 
 I couldn't stand it. 
 You know? 
 If she didn't come back it would break me. 
 Angelyne died to defend the right of these people to express their sick opinions. 
 It's just... They look so innocent until you realize what they represent. 
 Emma Cain's dreams of contributing to a whiter America. 
 She's so desperate to conceive, you know? 
 She's grasping at straws. 
 These expired over a year ago. 
 They gave up trying. 
 The one thing she was interested in wasn't happening. 
 She couldn't make white babies. 
 The tradwife wasn't fulfilling her purpose. 
 Maybe afraid of disappointing her husband, or even losing him. 
 Hey. 
 So Emma and Tyler have been road warriors over the past six months. 
 We have them in Boston, Buffalo, Pittsburg, Baltimore. 
 Literally all over the map scouting targets. 
 And we have tracked their phones to public monuments, train stations, bus terminals, Walmarts, Costcos. 
 We can eliminate places already covered by anti-terrorist units. 
 Focus on the soft targets. 
 Sounds right. 
 Jess. 
 You said what every agent I know thinks. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 And without the PC niceties. 
 You gotta see this. 
 It's a website Stevens spends an hour on every day. 
 Why 10-15? 
 It's a code for, "alien in custody." 
 It's a by invitation only site for ICE and border patrol agents. 
 "We're gonna stock the Rio Grande with gators. 
 Wetbacks for lunch," jokes about dead migrant children in the desert. 
 Then there's the memes. 
 _ 
 Toss that up to the Jock, would you? 
 All right, folks! 
 I'd like you to take a look at something. 
 This is a secret website for ICE and border agents, federal employees like us. Read those comments. 
 Look at those pictures. 
 You know, when citizens say they don't trust people who work for the government, it's because of bad apples like that. 
 People who post on this site bring shame on all of us. 
 I don't know about you, but it pisses me off, and I'm not gonna stand for it. 
 Now, we have a domestic terrorist cell with a bomb to find. I want everyone to bear down on this mission and show the public... you know, the people who pay our wages? 
 What duty and service are all about. 
 Let's dig in. 
 As soon as you get the names of the people on the site, send it up the food chain. 
 Start with the IG's office and Homeland Security, yeah? 
 Hey, Jubal? Yeah? 
 Our ICE supervisor, first name is Austin. 
 Austin, yeah. What's up? 
 I found this post in the photo section of that website. 
 Look at the caption. 
 "Me and training bro Austin on Lake Seminole." 
 He's throwing a white power hand sign. 
 Good catch. Where is Lake Seminole? 
 Georgia. 
 Who posted that? 
 It might be in the metadata. Hold on. 
 Michael Rees. 
 ICE officer. 
 Runs a detention facility in Ashburn, Georgia. 
 Slow down. 
 You're lucky I don't drag you out by your testicles, Mr. Rees. Now which one? 
 On the left. Dorm D. 
 Tali. Tali! 
 Tali! 
 
 
 
 Tali, it's your dad. Open it. 
 Tali. 
 I missed you so much, sweetheart. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm just tired. 
 They didn't turn the lights off. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. Let's get you home. 
 You had your grandparents really miss you. 
 Yeah, a ton. 
 You gave us a scare. 
 Wait. 
 What about my new friends? 
 Mis amigas nuevas. 
 Can't we do something? 
 Not today, sweetie. But we'll try, I promise. 
 Now you're gonna go to your grandma and grandpa because they missed you. Look, right here. 
 It's Crosby. 
 They got a BOLO hit on Joey Carter's truck up at Ulster County. They're on their way up there. 
 A bomb could still be in the truck. 
 Damn. 
 Drop your weapon! 
 Clear. 
 Dog tags say Joseph Carter, type O blood. 
 We got a body back here. 
 Bullet to the head. 
 Let's get his prints. See who we got here. 
 Copper wire. Cut with wire cutters. 
 These guys wired the bomb right here. 
 You know, with a remote trigger, we gotta assume it's fully operational. 
 Our dead guy's Jack Kendal, reported this morning along with his work van. 
 He's a janitor. 
 Report says that he has a route with 30 clients along with keys to each property. 
 Keys he doesn't have anymore. 
 Unless they're in his briefs. 
 One of those properties might be the target. 
 They took his van, his keys, his uniform... they might be using them to gain access. 
 Can we get a list of those properties from Kendal's company? 
 Get bomb squads out to each one. 
 30 properties to check out. 
 It'll be nice to whittle them down. 
 We know just the guy who can help. 
 I don't know anything about any bomb. 
 Agent LaCroix, tell them there's been some mistake. 
 I just got back from Georgia. 
 Mike Rees sends his regards. 
 I wouldn't have let anything bad happen to your girl. 
 Something bad already did happen to my little girl. 
 She was put in a cage for three days. 
 Herded around the country like cattle. 
 Didn't know if she'd ever see her family again. 
 Where's the target, Mr. Stevens? 
 I don't know. 
 Where's the target. I don't know. 
 They talked about a lot of places. 
 Sit down. 
 Where's the target? 
 I swear, I don't know. 
 Please... stop. 
 Tomorrow. 
 They said it was happening tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow when? I don't know. 
 Tomorrow morning! 
 Please. 
 Please. 
 Kendal's route has a handful of small businesses, doctor's offices, and residential buildings. 
 Nothing that fits the target profile. 
 We got local PD doing bomb sweeps on those properties just in case. 
 Now, we're also tracking the prior movements of these two suspects. That's Robbins and Ling. 
 They're identified from the fingerprints being on the truck. 
 They're using a remote trigger, not a timer, so that tells me they want control over the exact time of the explosion, so it has to be a specific event. 
 Eh. 
 We're missing something here. 
 They killed Kendal, took his uniform, his van... 
 Not for nothing. 
 What do we know about him? 
 Uh, he's single. Grew up in Ulster County. 
 Boss says he was well liked. 
 He's a steady worker. 
 He's not in politics, has no association to any white supremacist group. 
 Criminal record? 
 One case in Ellenville Village Court last August. 
 He was cited by the local parks department for taking five trout without a fishing license. 
 He was serving six months community service. 
 Where? 
 At the Ulster County Recreational Center in Kingston. 
 Kingston. Are you sure? 
 Henry Street? Yeah, that's the one. 
 You know this place? 
 Yes, my aunt Yara has her citizenship ceremony there. 
 There will be tons of immigrants, and it is happening this morning... it is happening now. 
 The ceremony starts in 20 minutes. 
 The remote trigger's effective within 200 yards. 
 Emma and her pals have eyes on the rec center, so if they see a sudden police presence or an evacuation, they will execute. 
 The rec center already has metal detectors in place. 
 Local police manning them have been instructed to slow things down, but they don't know why. - Copy that. 
 Targeting the rec center can't be a coincidence. 
 Well, after you shot Tyler Kane, they must've done to you what they did to me. They hacked you. 
 Yeah. 
 These people take things personally. 
 I went after Givens, so they went after Tali. 
 No, my family isn't answering. 
 There must not be any service inside the rec center. 
 Showtime. Happy couple. 
 Ew. Sweaty. 
 If you aren't sweating this, there's something seriously wrong with you. 
 We start in the basement under the gym. 
 Restrooms, supply closets, any place a janitor would have access to. 
 Let's go. 
 First, welcome you all here alongside all of your families. 
 Excuse me, excuse me. 
 It's an honor to have you all here. 
 Yeah, they're all bunched up at the metal detectors it's gonna take another 15 minutes before they're all in. 
 You let me worry about the timing. 
 You just make sure nobody gets in the way. 
 Boss, we see Emma's sidekicks. 
 Northwest corner, near the playing field. 
 Robbins was just on the phone. 
 Probably checking in with Emma. 
 They look antsy. 
 Probably wondering why it's taking people so long to get in. 
 You stay on them. 
 I'll keep looking for the queen bee. 
 Welcome everyone. 
 If you could all please file in as quickly as possible. 
 You've all been very patient, and we greatly appreciate it. 
 Welcome and congratulations. 
 We're giving free souvenir photos before the ceremony down the hall to the racquetball court. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Dios mio. 
 We found it. 
 Locker room under the gym. 
 There's enough here to bring down the building. 
 Just got on the roof. 
 Sorry, hi, uh, welcome. 
 How about a free souvenir photo before the ceremony starts? 
 Great, just go down the hallway and to the racquetball court. 
 Starting to disarm it now. 
 I got her. 
 On the bleachers, southside of the center. 
 Green jacket. 
 Getting into position. 
 You gotta buy us some time here. 
 Copy that. 
 Auntie Yara! 
 Excuse me. 
 Omar! I'm so glad you came. 
 Oh, these are my friends. Hi. 
 And their cousins are here. Hi. 
 Um, this is my sister's son. 
 They're giving free photos down the hallway. 
 You should go take some. 
 Uh, after the ceremony. I think it's about to... 
 If everyone can take their seats. 
 Let's go take a photo, now. 
 We're all eager for the ceremony to commence, but we cannot do so... 
 Oh, my God. 
 Don't talk to me like that ever again, you jerk. 
 Get away from me. 
 I can talk to you any damn way I want, bitch. 
 Oh, whoa, hey, hey! Cool it, man. 
 Got something to say!? 
 Big tough guy? 
 Don't move! Give me that hand! 
 Anything? No. 
 We got the sidekicks. There's no trigger. 
 Clinton, you good? In position. 
 Get up. 
 Tyler did that. 
 When we spoke to him, he said those were the only kind of babies you could give him. 
 That you're pathetic. 
 That's not true. 
 He told us about all the herbs you took. 
 He said, "some kind of tradwife she turned out to be." 
 Couldn't make white babies for the cause? 
 No. 
 I'm a good wife. 
 He was gonna leave you, did you know that? 
 We have evidence. 
 No! 
 You're in my line of fire. Move right. 
 We found a bank account buried to him under his name. 
 Checks to a girl. 
 A pregnant girl. 
 Please file in as quickly. 
 No. 
 I am a good wife! 
 Just step outside, guys. Right this way.
