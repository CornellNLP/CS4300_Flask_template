 years old, divorced. 
 Ex-wife is a nurse. 
 Did two years at Newark PD. 
 Worked private security after that, and he took the job at Carson Correctional last year. 
 An ex-cop turned prison guard... 
 Why did he leave Newark PD? 
 - It doesn't say. 
 - Warden said De Rossi got along well with everyone, even the prisoners. 
 Maybe too well. 
 He killed those inmates after he heard the FBI was coming. 
 Whatever these guys were involved in, he didn't want us asking questions. 
 Were these Lontocs the ones calling your friend? 
 I don't know. 
 They searched the whole prison, didn't find any phones. 
 And the one used to contact Matthew isn't pinging anymore. 
 De Rossi could've took 'em. 
 Well, I got some metadata, though. 
 Matthew was texting back and forth with that burner for at least a few days. 
 I just can't read any of the messages yet. 
 It's gonna take a while to scrape this. 
 You keep working on that. 
 Crosby? 
 You and Barnes track down the ex-wife. 
 Ortiz and I'll go see the Jersey Police gang unit. 
 Find out what we can about these Lontocs. 
 Brendan and I had only been married a year when he got fired. 
 What happened? 
 Well, officially, it was insubordination, which is basically a nice way of saying that he punched a desk sergeant in the mouth. 
 He always had a temper. 
 He did private security after that? 
 Off and on for a while, yeah. 
 But, mainly, he'd just go to the bar every night and come home drunk and complaining. 
 Is that why you divorced him? 
 I actually wasn't the one who filed. 
 He left you? 
 Yeah, after he started working at the prison. 
 All of a sudden, he's working out, he's buying new clothes, he's wearing this ridiculous cologne, constantly lying to me about where he'd go every night. 
 And then one day, he just came home and... 
 said he was leaving. 
 - Did he tell you why? 
 - I mean, I knew why. 
 He met someone. 
 He didn't have the guts to tell me who she was, and I didn't ask. 
 I was so angry and humiliated. 
 After all the crap he put me through, he was gonna better-deal me? 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Don't be. 
 I mean, obviously, it's good riddance, right? 
 Look, I don't know where he is. 
 And I'm sorry for all those people that he killed. 
 But honestly... 
 I hate the man. 
 And that woman, whoever she is, that he left me for, she deserves everything that she's getting. 
 Let her live with the shame... 
 not me. 
 All right. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Yeah. 
 The Lontocs have been here since the '  s. 
 They started with extorting Asian businesses, prostitution, even loan-sharking down in Atlantic City. 
 Now it's mostly drugs. 
 Just last year we busted up one of their fentanyl rings. 
 My buddies in the LAPD said     you burned a couple of their informants they were trying to work with West Coast connections. 
 They're still trying to rebuild those relationships. 
 Apologies for doing our job. 
 That must've put some of them behind bars. 
 Only the foot soldiers, and all of them went mute, refused to give up the top dog. 
 The "snakehead," as they call it. 
 You familiar with these two? 
 No. 
 What'd they do? 
 Died. 
 Murdered by a prison guard in Wantage this morning. 
 We think they might be using cell phones on the inside. 
 Well, it fits the Lontoc pattern. 
 Three of our perps on the fentanyl case had burners in lockup at Fairview, arranging deals on the street. 
 You're chasing the guard now? 
 Yeah. 
 Brendan De Rossi. 
 He also killed an employee. 
 We don't think they're connected, but somehow he got sideways with the Lontocs. 
 Knowing the Lontocs, here's what I have to say to Mr. De Rossi. 
 He'd better hope that you find him first. 
 You messed up, Brendan. 
 They're never gonna let this go. 
 I didn't plan this, Kellie! 
 The FBI was coming, they wouldn't give me the phones. 
 They attacked me! 
 It was either me or them. 
 We have to give them back and beg for mercy. 
 - No way.

 The burners are leverage, all right? 
 Without them, it's their word against ours. 
 We can use them. 
 We can make a deal. 
 We can negotiate our way out of this.

 Mary Calague. 
 She runs a home day care in Somerville. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
 I spent thousands of dollars to get in the program. 
 Application fees, visa fees, plane tickets. 
 What tipped you off something was wrong? 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Everything. 
 They kept finding ways to ask me for more money. 
 They even charged me for room and board. 
 So where'd you live? 
 It was a small room for me and three other women with nothing but a calendar to keep track of school events. 
 I'll never forget the quotation on it. 
 "For it is in giving that we receive." St. Francis of Assisi? 
 Yeah. 
 I gave and gave and received... 
 nothing but more debt. 
 Do you know this woman? 
 Kellie Reyes?

 She was a teacher, too. 
 But she stopped coming home at night, and one day she moved out. 
 Took all our passports and gave them to Mr. Stanley. 
 Stanley Vidorgiza? 
 I don't know his last name. 
 All I know is he's the one who was constantly asking for more money, saying there was problems with our visas and that we need to pay him more. 
 Did you ever report this to the police? 
 We were all too scared of being deported. 
 It's hard to explain. 
 So how did you get out? 
 God smiled on me. 
 My wife now... 
 She's a lawyer. 
 She helped me get my green card last year and paid for what I owed East- -West Teachers. 
 I'm lucky.
