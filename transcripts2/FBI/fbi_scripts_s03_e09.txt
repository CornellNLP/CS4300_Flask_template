 - Two hours ago, a woman named Addie Ricard was abducted at gunpoint and thrown into the trunk of a car. 
 We're still canvassing, but it's a quiet block. 
 Not much to go on yet. 
 Her phone and purse were found in the street. 
 Addie Ricard. 
 The political reporter?

 - Not personally. 
 - But I've read her work. 
 - Okay. 
 Any witnesses? 
 Just one, name's Derek Morales. 
 Mr. Morales? 
 I'm Agent Bell. 
 This is Agent Zidan. 
 We heard that you saw the abduction. 
 Can you tell us about it? 
 It happened quick. 
 The woman shouted, and then the prick shot at me. 
 Before I knew it, he had her in the trunk and was driving away. 
 Thank God his aim sucked. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 What did this guy look like? 
 Hard to tell. 
 He was wearing a black mask, about, uh, six feet tall. 
 I mean, they all look six feet, but... 
 Oh, he held the gun in his left hand, if that helps. 
 What about the car that he forced her into? 
 It was a sedan. 
 It was blue. 
 The trunk was already open, so I couldn't see the emblem. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That's all I could tell you. 
 No, no, no. 
 You did good. 
 If you think of anything else, please give us a call. 
 Thank you. 
 So gun, mask, trunk already popped. 
 This sounds premeditated. 
 Do you have any idea where she was headed? 
 According to her license, she lives about a block away.

 - Why would someone take her? 
 - What? 
 Was it just random, or...

 We do need to ask you some questions. 
 The more we know about your sister, the better chance we have of finding her.

 Addie got divorced three years ago, but it was amicable. 
 Her ex lives in California. 
 They're good friends. 
 Does she have anyone new in her life? 
 Yes, she's seeing someone, but I don't know his name. 
 Addie only mentioned him in passing. 
 She didn't wanna talk about it yet. 
 Was that weird to you that your sister didn't wanna talk about it? 
 I mean, a little, but she's funny like that. 
 Did she seem scared of him at all? 
 No, no. 
 She was excited. 
 Like she was madly in love. 
 What about the neighborhood? 
 Have you noticed any strange cars parked? 
 Maybe a blue one? 
 Not a blue one, but two days ago, there was this guy in an SUV just watching our place. 
 At the time, I just thought he was some kind of porch pirate, so I got up the courage to approach him, but as soon as I got close, he sped off. 
 I would really love to have two agents stay with you in case a ransom call comes in. 
 Is that okay? 
 Sure. 
 Please let me know as soon as you hear anything. 
 Of course. 
 Two hours ago, Pulitzer nominated "New York Times" journalist and frequent cable news guest, Addie Ricard, was abducted outside of her house in the West Village. 
 The man who took her was armed, wore a mask to disguise his identity. 
 Addie's phone and purse were untouched. 
 It's unlikely this was simply a crime of opportunity. 
 There's also a new mystery man in her life, someone she wasn't completely comfortable talking about just yet. 
 Let's scrub her phone, see if we can identify exactly who that is. 
 We should also pay special attention to her professional life. 
 We're looking into what she's been working on. 
 Maybe she was on the verge of something big,

 I just got off the phone with "The Times."   
 No recent threats. 
 No ransom demands. 
 All right. 
 Okay, well, check with that cable news show she was always on, see if the network has been contacted or is aware of any threats. 
 What did we learn from her cell phone? 
 The last call she made was to her sister right before she was grabbed, but we can't read her texts. 
 She has an encryption app on her phone. 
 All right. 
 We'll get the CART guys in here,

 Where are we on the suspicious SUV her sister saw parked in front of her house? 
 Yeah, I just found a security cam from up the block.

 How much more time do you need? 
 To capture all his cell data and the call logs, another    seconds. 
 Sorry. 
 One sec. 
 Um, just give me one second... 
 So sorry. 
 One sec. 
 Oh! 
 Okay. 
 Here we go. 
 Name's Mike Townes. 
 He's a local meth head. 
 Likes to break into cars and buildings. 
 You know, it won't be long before he's robbing people up close and personal. 
 If you file a charge, I can violate his probation and get him off the streets. 
 - [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
 - Got it. 
 - All done. 
 - No, I'm good. 
 Thanks for notifying me, though. 
 Appreciate your time, Mr. Branislav.

 - There's only one. 
 - It's to another burner. 
 - Location? 
 - Yeah, pinging it now. 
 I just got a signal. 
 It's in Flushing, Queens. 
 - Can you narrow in? 
 - Working on it. 
 Hey, guys, Sergei just texted the same burner phone. 
 "Cop was here. 
 Getting worried. 
 Coming to you." Then he told the guy to turn off his phone, said he was gonna do the same. 
 Hey, so Sergei's on the move. 
 Looks like he's going to meet up with Viktor. 
 - Do we still have eyes on him? 
 - No. 
 We lost him when he jumped on the BQE. 
 Got a BOLO out on his vehicle, though, so... 
 I just finished combing through Ethan's phone. 
 He called Sergei's burner two minutes after he and the senator talked to Maggie and OA. 
 - All right, grab up Ethan. 
 - Bring him in. 
 Yeah. 
 [SOLEMN MUSIC] 
 All right, Ethan, you got two choices. 
 Either you come clean about Addie, Sergei, the senator, or we're gonna charge you. 
 Charge me with what? 
 Obstruction, lying to a federal agent, and that's when the fun really begins. 
 - Racketeering, kidnapping... 
 - Look, I already told you. 
 I have no idea who kidnapped Addie, or why. 
 I'm trying to help you, but I need you to cooperate. 
 And I'm sorry, but I am just as in the dark as you are on this. 
 You are the senator's chief of staff. 
 It is your job to know. 
 You expect... 
 Ethan. 
 This is your last chance to come clean, to tell us everything you know, or we will move forward with criminal charges. 
 Okay, fine. 
 The senator told me that the kidnappers contacted him this morning about a ransom, but he told me not to say anything. 
 It would endanger her life. 
 And that is all I know. 
 I swear. 
 Why did you call Sergei Branislav? 
 Sergei? 
 I never called that guy in my life. 
 I don't even have his number. 
 Why... 
 [SCOFFS] 
 The senator asked to borrow my phone after the meeting. 
 He told me his battery was dead. 
 Okay. 
 Do the senator and Sergei know each other? 
 Are they friends? 
 Have they had business dealings with one another? 
 And why would Sergei take Addie? 
 What's his objective? 
 - I don't know! 
 - I have no idea, you guys. 
 If I did, I would tell you. 
 Jubal, I'd like to speak to Ethan alone for a minute. 
 You have one shot to save yourself. 
 One. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Why are you talking to me like I'm a criminal? 
 You're gonna wear a wire. 
 - A wire? 
 Seriously? 
 - What are you talking about? 
 You're gonna get the senator talking. 
 You're gonna find out why Addie was taken and where we can find her. 
 I understand that you're upset. 
 I do. 
 But do you really expect me to wear a wire     
 - and sell out Senator Hoffman... 
 - Yes! 
 That is exactly what I expect you to do. 
 I can't do that, Izzy. 
 My career will be over. 
 But unemployment is a whole hell of a lot better than prison.

 What's going on?

 The FBI just put me in handcuffs. 
 They think that you and Sergei have something to do with Addie's abduction. 
 - What? 
 - Yeah. 
 They questioned me for two hours. 
 What'd you tell them? 
 I told them that I had no idea what they were talking about. 
 No, no.

 Walt, my girlfriend is the SAC. 
 She calls the shots, and she trusts me. 
 And I can get her to cover for you, but I cannot do that unless you tell me exactly what happened. 
 Where's Addie? 
 Don't push too hard. 
 You want me to walk away from this? 
 From you? 
 You say the word, I'm gone. 
 If I knew where she was, I'd already be there. 
 I love this woman. 
 I will do anything I can to save her. 
 Okay, good. 
 That's good. 
 But what does Sergei have to do with any of this? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Sergei... 
 Sergei thinks I screwed him over. 
 He and I, we had a deal. 
 I told him about the federal redevelopment plan in Ozone Park, that it was a done deal. 
 And out of pocket, he started buying up adjacent land, and he was gonna kick me back   % of the profits, but... 
 The redevelopment funds already went to Staten Island. 
 Yeah. 
 And I told him there was nothing I could do about it. 
 So what is this? 
 Some kind of retaliation? 
 Well, yes. 
 Yes. 
 He already floated me some cash. 
 He floated me some gifts, and he told me if I didn't repay him, that he'd kill her. 
 If this gets out, you're done! 
 - You're going to jail, Walt! 
 - You don't think I know this? 
 Why do you think I've been going so crazy? 
 But I'm good. 
 I'm good. 
 You see, I've already come up with    ,    in cash. 
 Sergei said he'd take that as a down payment, so all we have to do... all we have to do is to get the FBI out of my life for a few hours. 
 And we're good.
