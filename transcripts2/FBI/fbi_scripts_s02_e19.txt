 Please stop. 
 Oh, oh... 
 It stops when you tell me what I need to know. 
 No... 
 Where is he? 
 Where is he?! 
 I don't know. Please, please. 
 Please. 
 This is all a mistake. 
 I didn't have anything to do with that man's death. 
 You really didn't do it, did you? 
 Yes, yes, yes. Yeah? 
 I promise. I swear. 
 Please, please. 
 I can't do that. 
 No, no, no. No, no, no. 
 No, no, no, no! 
 This is not the kind of stuff we want hitting the streets. 
 The person we're looking for had access to... 
 Need some help? 
 Hey, yeah, I'm looking for the SAC. 
 Isobel Castille. 
 Hi, uh, I'm Hailey. Detective Upton. 
 I've heard a lot of good things about you. 
 I'm Special Agent in Charge Isobel Castille. 
 We just caught a pretty gruesome murder, so you might as well hit the ground running. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 You will be partnered with Agent Zidan. 
 Hi, I'm OA. Hi. 
 Hailey. Nice to meet you. 
 You too. 
 Listen up, everyone. 
 This is Detective Hailey Upton from Chicago PD. 
 She will be with us for the next few weeks as part of our interagency training program. 
 All right, so let's, uh, direct our attention to the screens here. 
 Found the body of a young John Doe in St. Nicholas Park. 
 A hundred yards from Alexander Hamilton's house. 
 Federal land, federal case... and no, it is not where Aaron Burr shot him. 
 The famed duel took place in... anyone, anyone? 
 Weehawken, New Jersey. Kristen knew. 
 Unfortunately, there's far less clarity in the present homicide case. 
 Evidence of torture and abuse, the victim was brown-skinned, but there was no other evidence of a hate crime. 
 So let's dig in, get to work, start filling in the blanks. 
 Yeah? Go. 
 You ready? Yeah. 
 So, Chicago PD? Should I be nervous? 
 Nervous? 
 You guys have been in the news a lot and not for good reasons. 
 Uh, yeah, we've had some issues, but they're being addressed. 
 It's a great place. I'm proud to be a part of it. 
 Listen, in the future, if you want to insult me, you can just go ahead and do it. 
 You don't have to disguise the putdown with humor. 
 Which car? This one? 
 Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean it like that. 
 I guess that's just my way of saying we do things different here. 
 Mm. 
 Just trying to keep it real. 
 So you spend much time in New York? 
 Nah, first time here. 
 Any early observations? 
 Pizza's too thin. 
 It's like a cracker with sauce on it. 
 Just trying to keep it real. 
 Yo! 
 You two taking the handle on this? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'm Agent Zidan, this is Detective Upton. 
 Can you bring us up to speed? 
 Jogger called it in. 
 No blood pooled on the ground. No shell casings. 
 So it looked like the guy was killed at another location and dropped off here. 
 Did the jogger see the body being dropped? 
 If she did, I would've said so. 
 It's a New York thing. 
 It felt like a cop versus fed thing. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 You think you're better than us. 
 No phone, no wallet? No nothing. 
 Don't even know what the kid's ethnicity is. 
 Could be Hispanic, Middle Eastern... 
 His face is so torn up, I can't tell which. 
 That's a Kada, so he's probably Indian. 
 Sikh. 
 Could still be a hate crime, though. 
 Most of the people around here don't really care which shade of brown you are. 
 We have a university bookstore receipt dated yesterday. 
 Thanks. 
 Got a hit on facial rec. 
 Victim's name is Aman Patel. 
 25. Indian national. 
 All right, notify the Indian Consulate so they can make the appropriate notifications. 
 He's a registered student at Paul Revere University, Yes, here on an F-1 student visa. 
 Before that, he graduated top of his class out of a university in India. 
 Then he came here to pursue a masters in engineering. 
 Any priors or run-ins with the campus cops? 
 No, looks like he was too busy getting a 4.0 GPA. 
 Right. 
 M.E. just confirmed that he was tortured. 
 Nails were torn off one by one, fingers pulled back and individually broken. 
 Kay, so someone wanted Aman to suffer or needed answers. The question is, which one? 
 Do we have a home address? Not yet. 
 We do have a PO box over at the university. 
 All right, head over there and see what you can learn. 
 He was a great kid. Every professor's dream. 
 Did Aman ever mention any issues? 
 Threats, fears, anything out of the ordinary? 
 I'm not sure if this is related, but... something happened a few days ago. 
 He was being harassed walking to class. 
 Some racist guy was taunting him. 
 Calling him a terrorist. 
 Mm-kay. One last thing: 
 Do you have any idea where Aman was living? 
 No, but I know he walked to school. 
 And he didn't like his roommate. 
 Said he partied too much. 
 Can you think of anything else? 
 No, sorry. 
 It's okay. Thank you. 
 Actually, there's a laundromat near the house. 
 Aman thought it was the greatest thing ever. 
 Clean clothes for 20 bucks a week. 
 I get it. This is New York. 
 There are dry cleaners on every block. 
 I'm just trying to tell you what I know. 
 The home address he used to secure the PO box was from Albany. 
 Apparently, he has an uncle who lives there. 
 But he wasn't living there. 
 You can't walk to campus from Albany. 
 I'm sorry, that's the only address I've got. 
 Anything else? 
 Yes, uh, Professor Banks said Aman was on the wrong end of some racial taunting recently. 
 Did he file a report? 
 Yes, the man's name is Frank Prichard, comes around here about once a week, always spewing racial nonsense. 
 Campus security ever detain him? 
 Yep. Several times. 
 Okay, I'll need to see those reports right away. 
 Free country. 
 I got a right to speak my mind. 
 Is this how you speak your mind? 
 What? No. 
 Oh, no, I don't kill people. I'm a patriot! 
 I'm just... I'm trying to keep the neighborhood safe. 
 Safe from what? 
 Arabs. 
 Excuse me. Not the good ones, like you. 
 I'm talking about the ones with bombs. 
 I'm just doing what the government wants me to do. 
 "See something, say something," huh? 
 No. See something, do something. 
 See, I get pictures of the ones I think are suspicious. 
 You see this guy, Frank? 
 He's an Indian. Not an Arab. 
 It's kind of the same thing, right? 
 Before he died, he told his professor that you were harassing him, calling him all sorts of colorful names. 
 It's possible. 
 Gonna need an alibi, Frank. 
 Where were you last night? 
 New York Hospital. 
 Had a gallstone. 
 Just got out this morning. 
 Gonna need copies of those photos too. 
 Now. 
 I had a thumb drive. 
 Here. 
 Saves me a stamp. 
 Was gonna mail them to Homeland Security anyway. 
 If I hear you're harassing any more immigrants, I'm gonna come back here, and I'm gonna break your arm. 
 Do you understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 I forwarded Kristen the pictures of Aman. 
 She'll get us a street block number based on the license plates in the background. 
 Just like that, huh? The FBI, Upton. 
 Our tech resources are pretty sick. 
 Look, it's not a big deal, but now that you're working with us, just try and be a little bit more careful. 
 If that guy Prichard calls the Bureau complaining that you threatened to use force... 
 Look, man, I don't need a lesson on how to talk to people, all right? 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Don't get me wrong. 
 I have no problem with someone breaking that idiot's arm, it's just... 
 It's just that the Bureau is hardcore, and they take that stuff really seriously. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 If he files a beef, I'll eat it and make sure you're clear. 
 All right? Appreciate that. 
 But what the hell's a beef? 
 It's an expression. I'm kidding. 
 Kristen said Aman's house is around this area. 
 Emily said there's a laundromat at the corner. 
 Okay, there's one right there. 
 And the house has a blue door. 
 Blue door. 
 All right. 
 Door's open. 
 FBI! Anybody home? 
 I'll go up. Copy. 
 Living room's clear. 
 Nice place for a college student. 
 OA! 
 Place has been tossed. 
 Must be Aman's room. 
 There's another bedroom. Emily mentioned a roommate. 
 Okay. 
 Based on the clothes and the photos, Aman's roommate is around 30 years old, male, and likes to party. 
 All of this searching has to be connected to the murder somehow. 
 Like the killer didn't get what he wanted from Aman, so he came back here and started searching. 
 Question is, for what? 
 Gun! 
 Drop your weapon now! 
 He's bailing out the back! I'm on him! 
 Shots fired, in foot pursuit. Requesting backup. 
 On your six! 
 Stop! 
 Get out of the way! 
 Where is he? 
 I lost him. 
 Responding units, be advised, the suspect was last seen running south, described as male... Damn it. 
 Hispanic, early 40s, black jacket. 
 By the way, thank you. 
 Huh? For what? 
 For saving my ass back there. In the house. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. 
 Cool. You're welcome. 
 Kelly, you guys start working on the surveillance video. 
 Pull camera footage from every camera within a mile radius of that house. 
 I want a name and face of the upstanding citizen that just opened up on OA and Upton, yeah? 
 Jubal? Yep. 
 I just spoke to the owner of the house Aman was living in, he signed a lease with someone named Lucas Reed seven months ago. 
 Nice. Throw it up. 
 Check it out, we have the name of Aman's roommate, Lucas Reed. 
 23, unemployed, did three semesters at the University of Miami. 
 He's got one misdemeanor prior for marijuana possession. 
 The question is, what is his relationship with our murder victim? 
 Are they just roomies, or is there something else going on here? 
 You guys grab a scuba tank. Do a deep dive. 
 Don't come up for air until you got something. 
 Uh, canvassed the area, talked to a lot of the neighbors. 
 Sounds like this Lucas Reed guy's one flashy man about town. 
 Threw a lot of parties, played loud music... 
 Yeah. So the neighbors loved him. 
 Exactly. Anybody seen him recently? 
 A woman named Denise Walters saw him take off yesterday afternoon in a silver Range Rover. 
 Right... oh, oh, uh, ping Reed's phone, see if we can get a location. 
 Yeah, I've been trying to do just that. 
 I haven't found a phone registered to him as of yet. 
 Uh-huh, well, let's put out a BOLO on this silver Range Rover. 
 Sooner we talk to this guy, the better. 
 Just got ballistics back on the slugs fired at OA and Upton. 
 They match the bullets that killed Aman, but get this: 
 They also match the bullets pulled from a drive by murder victim two months ago. 
 Could they ID a suspect yet? 
 Yeah, arrested him too. 
 Name is Santiago Gonzalez, known associate of the Latin Players. 
 He's being held at MDC pending trial. 
 Latin Players. That's a Chicago gang. 
 Hmm, looks like they're expanding. 
 So the Latin Players killed someone, they get arrested, go to jail, and the gun stays on the street. 
 And the new owner uses said gun to kill Aman, a studious Indian engineering student? 
 Right. What are we missing? 
 How are these two murders connected? 
 Have OA and Upton pay a visit to Inmate Gonzalez. 
 Maybe he can help us answer that question. 
 Right. 
 So this guy, Gonzalez, is originally from Chicago. 
 Runs with the Latin Players, so maybe you should take the lead on this one. 
 But go hard on him. 
 You want a reaction? A big one. 
 Big enough to force him to call his people. 
 I think I can do that. 
 Where's the gun you used in the drive-by? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 One of your friends used it to kill a civilian last night. 
 Used it again this afternoon on us. 
 Fired off ten rounds. 
 Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You're staring 20 to life on the case you're riding. 
 Give us the name of the person you gave the gun to, and maybe I'll be able to get you a reduced sentence. 
 Get my ass, blondie. 
 I'm not a fed like him. I'm Chicago police. 
 So what? 
 Means I play by different rules. 
 Also means I know the names of all the shot callers in the Latin Players. 
 Tomorrow morning, we're gonna do a warrant sweep. 
 Means a lot of people you know are gonna get arrested. 
 That's not my problem. But it is. 
 Because I'm gonna make sure that they know you are the snitch who gave them up. 
 Now, you know nobody's gonna believe that. 
 Really? Because in my experience, pissed-off bangers don't do their homework, and if they think you're a snitch, you're a snitch. 
 In the street, rumors become facts like that. 
 I'm done talking. 
 All right. 
 So you think he believed us? 
 I don't know. What? 
 Nothing, you just reminded me of my partner, Maggie, in there. Oh. 
 How are you, sir? 
 In a good way. 
 Then thank you. 
 Can you cue up the audio feed? 
 So where is your partner? 
 Uh, she is on an undercover assignment. 
 That I know absolutely nothing about besides the fact that she is gone and unreachable. 
 That's gotta be pretty tough. 
 Yeah, but she's really good, so she'll be fine. 
 We're up. 
 Yo, just say the word, man. 
 Chicago about to throw that heat. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Police and FBI here sweating me, man. 
 About what? 
 That piece that I left behind. 
 I'm guess it's all connected to what happened on the night at Highbridge Park. 
 All right, thanks for looking out. 
 No doubt. 
 Can you trace the number that he called? 
 Pay phone up in Washington Heights. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Any idea what we're looking for? 
 Not really. 
 All we know is something happened here three nights ago that might be linked to Aman's murder. 
 Okay, let's look for video cameras. 
 Canvass for witnesses. 
 Excuse me. 
 Do you walk through here often? 
 Uh, yeah. I live close by. 
 Were you here three nights ago? 
 I don't think so. I'm not really sure. 
 Do you remember seeing anything unusual? 
 People arguing? Gunshots? 
 No. Sorry. 
 Can I go now? Yeah. 
 Hey! 
 Got a glove for whatever that's worth. 
 Runner! 
 Hey! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, amigo. 
 Don't shoot! Relax, we're not gonna shoot. 
 Just take a deep breath. 
 Why you running? 
 Because I just saw that guy, and I didn't want to get blamed for it. 
 Blamed for what? 
 The dead body. What dead body? 
 Over there. 
 I just wanted to see it, I swear. 
 I've never seen a dead guy before. 
 Just watch him. 
 Hey, guys! 
 I'm guessing this is what happened in Highbridge Park a few nights ago. 
 So the kid heard there was a body in the park and wanted to see it. He know anything else? 
 No, he overheard some kids in the park talking about it. 
 Doesn't even know their names. 
 He has an alibi for the time of death too, so we released him to his parents. 
 What else do we know about the dead guy? 
 Well, Ernesto Garcia, known member of the Latin Players, three priors, all narcotics-related, right? 
 Anything else? 
 Word in Chicago is he's the number two here in New York. 
 All right. So how's his death connected to the engineering students? 
 No idea. But it is connected. 
 We heard Santiago talking to his buddies, saying that it's related to something that went down in Highbridge Park, which we now know is Ernesto. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Here's the footage we recovered from the park. 
 Great. Camera angle's about 20 yards east of the location of Ernesto's body. 
 That's Lucas Reed, Aman's roommate, walking away from the body. 
 He's only wearing one glove too. 
 Okay, so, Lucas kills Ernesto, takes the backpack full of product, and goes into hiding. 
 The Latin Players find out what happened, go after Lucas, but take Aman instead. 
 And they beat and torture him hoping to get intel on Lucas. 
 Makes perfect sense. 
 The problem is, we don't have enough evidence. 
 There is no video, no prints, no DNA, nothing connecting anyone to Aman's murder. 
 Which is why we need to find Lucas Reed. 
 He is the missing link. 
 We arrest him for killing Ernesto and then leverage his ass to take down the banger responsible for torturing and killing Aman. 
 I don't know where Lucas is, but I found some recent photos off of his social media. 
 I'm guessing that's his girlfriend. 
 Hold on. I talked to her at the park, right before we found Ernesto's body. 
 Ah, and we have a hit off of social rec. 
 Her name is Harper Quinlan, 23 years old, last known address is 84 Groton Street, Queens, New York. 
 Go. 
 She hasn't lived here for a while. 
 About two years. 
 Do you know a guy named Lucas Reed? 
 No, never heard of him. Why? 
 When was the last time you talked to your daughter? 
 Hold on. What's this all about? 
 We believe that your daughter's boyfriend might be involved in a murder. 
 Oh. 
 I haven't talked to Harper in five or six months. 
 She just... 
 We lost touch. 
 She dropped out of college, started partying... 
 What about her friends? 
 Stopped talking to them too. It's like... it's like she just cut herself off from everybody she knew and loved. 
 You said that her boyfriend might be involved. 
 What about Harper? She's not part of this, is she? 
 We don't know. We're still investigating. 
 You know where she's living now? 
 Some crappy apartment over in Brooklyn. 
 I, uh, followed her one day to this building in Red Hook. 
 But you didn't talk to her. I tried to. 
 She... she asked me to leave. 
 Uh, if she happens to reach out, give us a call. 
 I will. The odds ain't great. 
 Trust me. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 OA and Upton got an address for the girlfriend. 
 They're headed there now. 
 Kristen. Yeah? 
 Forwarded you some new video from Highbridge Park, different angles, wider coverage. 
 Uh, 5:54 p.m., that's the timestamp on the last video when we saw Lucas leaving the murder scene with the backpack. 
 Okay. All right, got something. 
 Check this out. 
 That's Lucas' Range Rover, but he got into the passenger's side. 
 Zoom in. Who's driving? 
 Son of a bitch. 
 OA, you're no longer going over to the apartment to talk to Harper. 
 You're going over there to arrest her. 
 Why were you at the park? I told you before. 
 I was walking. 
 Or was it to recover the glove that Lucas dropped after he killed his drug supplier? 
 I don't know anything about that. 
 We have video of you in the driver's seat of Lucas' Range Rover at Highbridge Park the night that Lucas killed Ernesto Garcia, so you are now an official suspect in a murder investigation. 
 That means no more lying, no more protecting your boyfriend. 
 You either cooperate with us here and now, or you go to prison. 
 I'm not gonna help you ruin Lucas' life. 
 I just won't. He's a good person. 
 Harper, good people don't sell drugs or kill people. 
 Yeah, you don't know him like I do. 
 He's so nice, and... he's sweet... In love. 
 More like dumb love. 
 What's the difference? 
 He really loves me. 
 Lucas isn't who you think he is, Harper. 
 Protecting him will only get you and more innocent people hurt. 
 Tell me why you think he was in the park that night. 
 I'm not gonna help you. 
 Are you listening to what I'm saying to you? 
 You're a suspect in a murder investigation here. 
 
 
 
 Lying to protect him makes this worse. 
 You're putting more lives at risk. 
 Be smart. 
 Tell me why you were there that night. 
 Harper, you don't need to go to prison for him. 
 Unlock it. 
 What's going on? 
 Do it. 
 Pull up your texts. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What does it say? 
 "Return the product, or he's dead. 
 "You have four hours. 
 "Tell your man to meet us at the place we did our first deal." 
 Oh, my... oh, my God. 
 Kay, Tom Quinlan, father of Lucas Reed's girlfriend, has been abducted by the Latin Players. 
 His home address is 84 Groton Street. 
 His work address is 29 Parsons Boulevard. 
 Let's get boots on the ground in both neighborhoods, canvass for witnesses, pull traffic PODS, surveillance cams. 
 Hey, Jubal? Yeah? 
 We ran Tom's phone. 
 It was shut off three seconds after the text was sent, but it pinged a tower in Washington Heights. 
 Good, good, good. There's another neighborhood to dig into. 
 Washington Heights. Same deal: Witnesses, video. 
 Emily, you wanna grab Scola and head down there? 
 We're on a clock, people! We got four hours. 
 Correction, three hours and 49 minutes. 
 Let's get moving. 
 Harper's our best play. 
 We get her to cooperate, we got a chance. 
 Well, I agree, but so far she's been a brick wall. 
 Mm. 
 Let me take a run at her. 
 I might have an angle to play. 
 You're in a tough place right now, Harper. 
 We have video of you at the scene of a murder, which makes you an accessory. 
 You're looking at 15 to 20 years in prison. 
 But if you cooperate, we can help you. 
 We'll talk to the prosecutor, explain why you were there, help him understand the nature of your relationship with Lucas. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I know what's going on. 
 He hurts you, doesn't he? 
 No. That's not true. 
 He's a good guy... No, he's not. 
 What are those bruises on your neck? 
 You tried to cover them up, but I can see them. 
 When you first met, I bet he was great. 
 You guys hit it off, you had fun. 
 He was everything you wanted. 
 But then he started chipping away at your friends and your family. 
 So you pop a pill to numb the pain and tell yourself everything's okay, just hoping that the abuse is gonna stop. 
 Harper. 
 It won't. 
 I talked to your dad. 
 He loves you very much. 
 And he needs you right now. 
 He's in a lot of danger. 
 If these guys don't get their drugs back, they will kill him. 
 The only thing that matters now is you helping us to find Lucas, so we can recover the drugs and find your dad. 
 So how do you know so much about abuse? 
 I am sorry, I did not mean anything by that. 
 No, it's fine. It's all good. 
 Everyone becomes a cop for a reason. 
 I guess that's mine. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Don't forget, Harper. 
 He wants the cash to get out of town, but we need the location where he first met his dealer. 
 That's where your dad is. 
 Got eyes on Lucas. 
 Just got out of the Range Rover. 
 Here we go. 
 Sup, baby. Hey. 
 How much you get? 2,400. 
 Nice work. Nice work. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 Babe. 
 They took my father. 
 What are you talking about? 
 That guy that you deal with, they grabbed my father and texted me that they're gonna kill him unless we return the drugs that you took. 
 Oh, no, no. 
 I can't... I can't do that. 
 They took my father! 
 Look, I feel bad, but they will kill me. 
 Oh, Jesus, don't... Lucas. 
 Don't give me the sad eyes look. 
 Lucas. 
 I'm screwed. 
 Look, I gotta look out for me... for us, you understand? 
 Look, I need to know where you and Ernesto did your first deal 
 'cause that's where they wanna meet. 
 I just told you, I'm not going... 
 I will go! 
 I'll call my uncle. He has a lot of money. 
 Maybe I can negotiate a deal or something. 
 I gotta get moving, all right, so give me the money. 
 Where did you meet him? Stay strong. 
 Location first, then give him the money. 
 Lucas. 
 Lucas. Lucas! 
 I'll call you later on, all right? 
 Damn it. Move in now! 
 Lucas! 
 You lying sack of... 
 Get down! 
 Get down! Move, move! 
 Oh! 
 Get down! 
 Move! Get down! 
 Drop it! Get down! 
 Ooh! 
 Lucas! Lucas! 
 Lucas! Lucas... 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 No, no, no! 
 It's okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 This is my fault. 
 I screwed up. No, you did great. 
 I shouldn't have given him the money. 
 I didn't even get the location. 
 Listen, we'll find the location. 
 We'll find the drugs. Don't worry about that. 
 Sounded like he was ready to hit the road, so I'm guessing his dope is close by. 
 Nothing back here. Yeah. 
 There's nothing here either. 
 Any luck? 
 Nope. Nothing. 
 You have the keys on you? Yeah. 
 Here, let me try something. 
 Hop in. Shut the trunk. 
 I already pushed it. Nothing happened. 
 Okay, Chicago. 
 I have a CI who installs these things. 
 Engine has to be on and doors closed in order for it to open. 
 Okay, we got the dope. 
 Now we just gotta figure out where to deliver it to. 
 Yep. 
 We have Lucas' texts from the phone he was carrying. 
 Since Harper said he started doing business with the Latin Players about a month ago... 
 Yeah. We need to scrub that time period. 
 There, on the 28th. There's a text that says, "Meeting's at 2. Let's do 9 instead of 8." 
 "Let's do 9 instead of 8"? 
 But the meeting's at 2:00. Is that some sort of code? 
 Well, here's Lucas' GPS data from that day around that time. 
 All right, so from 1:37 to 3:12, he was in Brooklyn down by the river. 
 Kristen, can you zoom in? Mm-hmm. 
 Get a more specific look at this. 
 Yeah, over here. Can you drill down right there? 
 Okay. 
 They met at 2:00 at a dock. 
 Pier nine instead of pier eight. 
 That's the meeting place. There it is. 
 We've got 67 minutes to get the drugs down to pier nine. 
 Unfortunately, the guy we need to deliver the drugs is at the city morgue. 
 I'll go under as Lucas' friend. 
 I'll give him the coke in exchange for Harper's dad. 
 No. These guys have done their homework. 
 They're not gonna buy that. 
 I get it, but I think I can pull it off. 
 No, I agree with OA. It's too risky. 
 So we need a plan C. 
 Let me do it. 
 He's my father. 
 I'm the one who got him into this awful situation. 
 So let me do it. 
 Let me do something meaningful. 
 Something that will make me feel good about myself... 
 Please. 
 Gotta let me do it. 
 You're gonna do great. 
 Just follow the plan we laid out. 
 He doesn't get the second bag until you see your father. 
 Right. Got it. 
 And if your dad's not at the meeting place, you tell the man to bring him there. 
 He'll say no. You stand your ground. 
 You have more leverage than you think. 
 This dope is worth a lot of money, and that's all they really care about. 
 It's okay to be nervous. 
 They'd be suspicious if you weren't. 
 You good? 
 I'm good. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Here we go. 
 Alpha team in position. 
 Where's Lucas? 
 He sent me instead. 
 And my product? 
 There's only one kilo here. 
 The other four are close by. 
 Close by doesn't do me no good. 
 Show me where my father is, and I'll get you the other four. 
 Don't get cute with me, mama. 
 I'll cut your throat. 
 Go get my dope. 
 Let's get ready to move in. 
 No, no. Give her a chance. 
 You trying to get your dad killed? 
 'Cause that's what's happen if you keep playing. 
 I need to see him. He's alive. 
 I promise. 
 I need proof. 
 Right over there, chica. 
 Okay, we got eyes on the dad. We're good to go. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Let's see if we can get him talking about Aman's murder. 
 As soon as we see a weapon, we roll. 
 Okay. 
 Be a good girl, go get my dope. 
 Do that, Big Papa walks. 
 I'll go with you. 
 So... 
 So... 
 How do I know you're not gonna kill me and my father once I give you the dope? 
 I don't kill civilians. Bad for business. 
 You kill that Indian guy? 
 He was a civilian. 
 I try my best, but I'm not perfect, mama. 
 You did good, Harper. 
 FBI! Don't move! 
 Drop your weapon now! 
 Let me see your hands now! 
 Hands up! Put the gun on the ground! 
 Step away! Put it down now! 
 Get on the ground! Get on the ground, now! 
 Dad! 
 Oh! 
 Let me go! 
 Dad! 
 Dad! 
 Dad! 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I just filed my 302. Do you need help with yours? 
 Nah, I just finished. 
 So, I have to admit, I wasn't so sure about you. 
 Yeah, well, I wasn't sure about you either. 
 But you're all right. For a fed. 
 You wanna grab a beer? 
 I'm okay. 
 You don't have to look after the new kid. 
 I am pretty sure you don't need looking after. 
 Come on, you saved my life. 
 The least you can do is let me buy you a drink. 
 For the tenth time, I didn't save your life. 
 All right, let's grab a beer, but only if you tell me why you became a fed. 
 I told you my reason. 
 It's only fair you tell me yours. 
 Deal.
