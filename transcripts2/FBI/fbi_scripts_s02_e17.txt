 Our blood is on your hands! Climate change is not a lie! 
 Do not let our people die! Our blood is on your hands! 
 Climate change is not a lie! Do not let our people die! 
 Our blood is on your hands! 
 Climate change is not a lie! Do not let our people die! 
 Our blood is on your hands! 
 Climate change is not a lie! Do not let our people die! 
 Our blood is on your hands! 
 Hey, you wanted to see me? 
 Yeah, please. 
 So I spoke to the ADIC, and he told me about your job offer. 
 I support whatever decision you make. 
 I hate to lose you, but I know it'd only be for a few months. 
 Thank you. I appreciate that. 
 I'm gonna turn it down. 
 You know, I love the work that we do, and I've got a great partner. 
 Listen, I know the ADIC well, and if you turn him down once, he won't ask again. 
 That... so you're saying I don't really have a choice. 
 I know how these things work, and I want to make sure you have all the facts before you make your decision. 
 Thank you, everyone, for coming out and braving the cold. 
 I think those government suits really heard us loud and clear. 
 I still need a couple volunteers for next week's protest in Times Square. 
 If you're interested, just hit me up. 
 It was great. Thank you, thank you. 
 A toothbrush and some shaving cream will get that right out. Oh, thanks, Pete. 
 Count me in for Times Square. 
 Are you sure? 
 There is a really good chance we'll all get arrested. 
 If Jane Fonda can spend a night in the slammer, so can I. 
 Do you wanna get a drink? 
 I would, but I just got out of this relationship... 
 No, that's okay. Maybe next week we could... 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. Mmm. 
 Um, why does it smell like feet? 
 It's the white truffles. 
 They're flown in directly from Piedmont. 
 You can only get them a few months out of the year. 
 Oh, come on, don't tell me you've never had a truffle. 
 I think we've established that we grew up under very different circumstances, Mona. 
 Try it. They're a delicacy. 
 They taste like feet too. 
 I'm joking. It's good. 
 But... Mm? 
 How's your case going? 
 So far so good. Closing arguments are tomorrow. 
 Work? 
 Yeah, it's urgent. 
 Sorry, uh, next dinner's on me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Where's Maggie? Jules said she had a meeting. 
 Okay, how many casualties we looking at? 
 Don't know yet. FPS and NYPD were first on scene. 
 Detective Howard, Special Agents Ryder and Zidan. 
 What are we looking at? 
 One dead, one wounded. 
 Both members of a climate change group protesting outside the EPA's New York offices. 
 Deceased is Nicole Mitchell, 33-year-old art gallery owner from Brooklyn... took three shots to the back. 
 Over a hundred protesters gathered... lucky more people weren't shot. 
 How many shots were fired? 
 Conflicting reports... could be three, could be as many as ten. 
 Anybody get a look at the shooter? 
 It was dark. 
 Appears he shot from inside a vehicle. 
 Handful of witnesses say they saw a dark-colored sedan speeding away. 
 We're gonna check for surveillance videos. 
 Are we thinking that this was political? 
 That the protesters were targeted? 
 Seems that way. 
 Is the organizer of the protest here? 
 Maybe he knows something. 
 Pete Bradford... he's our other victim. 
 EMTs are prepping him for transport now. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 All right, y'all, come on in! 
 Sorry you had to cancel your evening plans. 
 So our unknown suspect shot two people in a protest just around the corner from this building, and the burning question is, was this attack motivated by political ideology? 
 Mary, you wanna check the chatter? 
 See if any climate change deniers are claiming credit for this online. 
 Kris, you and your team wanna look into the two victims... their jobs, their personal lives? 
 Yeah. 
 And someone check the shot spotter. 
 See if we can't nail down how many shots were fired. 
 I got it. Yes, sir. 
 Hey. Yeah? 
 The UN is hosting a climate change summit next month. Ah. 
 This kind of attack is not gonna play well. 
 Did we get anything from the surveillance footage? 
 Yeah... Kelly, where are we on the shooter's car? 
 I can't get a clean angle on the plate. 
 I can confirm that he's driving a gray Honda Accord with a gold bumper. 
 All right, gray Honda Accord, gold bumper. 
 Let's put out a BOLO. Start pulling traffic stops. 
 See if we can't find someone who spotted a vehicle matching that description. 
 Look, I didn't see much. 
 When I felt the bullet hit my leg, my survival instinct kicked in, and I... just played dead until I knew he was gone. 
 We know this is hard, Mr. Bradford, but can you tell us, has anyone been threatening your group? 
 You kidding? My inbox is flooded with tons of vicious attacks from internet trolls. 
 What kind of attacks? 
 They say that we're an arm of the Islamic State. 
 They say that we're being paid to spread liberal lies. 
 Have you told the cops any of this? 
 No, I wish I had. 
 I never thought someone would do something like this. 
 Okay, we need access to those emails. 
 And if you think of anything else, let us know. 
 Hey, look who decided to join us. 
 I had a work thing. 
 Everything okay? Yeah, fine. 
 Kristen, you have all of us. 
 Okay, so we checked the shot spotter. 
 First gunshot was recorded at 7:53 p.m. followed by two more in rapid succession. 
 But we know that Nicole Mitchell took three rounds and Pete took one, so shouldn't there have been at least four gunshots? 
 Well, M.E. just brought me up to speed... said that one of the bullets that hit Nicole actually exited her body and struck Pete. 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 If the shooter came here to mow down protestors, then why would he stop at three shots? 
 'Cause she was the only one he was aiming for. 
 Okay, so it appears Nicole Mitchell was targeted by our shooter, and the question is, why her? 
 So what do we know about her life? 
 Well, her dad's a Wall Street guy... 
 Arthur Mitchell. He manages Mitchell Financial. 
 Arthur Mitchell... does that name sound familiar to me? 
 He's a major donor to the Republican party... famously bought a local election just so he could build a gun range in his backyard. 
 So her dad has his own enemies. 
 Let's assemble a list. What else do we know about Nicole? 
 Well, she graduated with honors from Columbia Law School, followed that up with a short stint at the Federal Public Defender's office, and then devoted her time and money to various progressive causes, any one of which could have made her a target. 
 All right, well, let's do a deep dive into Nicole's life... any recent issues, conflicts, and let's get Emily and Scola over to her dad's place. 
 I don't have to guess who did this. 
 I know who did this. His name is Todd Conroy. 
 That an employee of yours? 
 Nicole's ex. 
 They met six months ago through a mutual friend. 
 Things seemed to be going well. 
 They were even planning a trip to Ibiza, and then, a week ago, Nicole ended it. 
 Any idea why? 
 My daughter hasn't shared the intimate details of her love life with me since she had a crush on Tommy Jenkins in the fifth grade. 
 But she told you Conroy didn't take the break-up well? 
 Conroy was showing up at her loft at all hours, sending her threatening text messages. 
 My lawyers were in the process of getting an order of protection against him. 
 And you believe Conroy's capable of something like this? 
 There were very few things that scared her. 
 Todd Conroy was one of them. 
 If only I had done something more. 
 You can't blame yourself, Mr. Mitchell. 
 I'm not a good person, Agent Scola. 
 I've known that for a long time. 
 But Nicole... 
 She was good. 
 She was the only good thing I've ever done. 
 According to the victim's father, Nicole was being stalked by an ex-boyfriend. 
 Todd Conroy... local nightclub promoter with a profitable side hustle dealing club drugs... 
 Molly, cocaine, GHB, you name it. 
 Guy's a regular candy store. 
 Okay, so Conroy's on probation. 
 Did six months for possession with intent to distribute and was picked up two years ago for an unspecified domestic disturbance. 
 His then-girlfriend declined to press charges. 
 Sounds like a real winner. 
 So how did a bleeding heart like Nicole hook up with a scumbag like him? 
 Guys like Conroy know how to blend in. 
 Emily's right. 
 I've going through Nicole's phone, and last week, she texted Conroy and accused him of using her to get access to her friends. 
 So he charms her with his good looks and rich kid veneer, and then he sells designer drugs to her deep-pocketed friends. 
 Mm-hmm, next day, she texted everyone she knew, told them Conroy was a poser, a dealer, and that's when things got really nasty. 
 Conroy started sending dozens of angry text messages, including this one, a few hours before the attack. 
 Notice the last one: "I'll end you." 
 That's not all. 
 Conroy's phone pinged off a tower, Lower Manhattan, 8:30 p.m. last night. 
 Bring him in. 
 Hey, Scola. 
 Is that him? 
 I got it. 
 Conroy, stop! 
 Gun! 
 Conroy, stop! 
 Going somewhere? 
 Fished that out of the river. 
 It's not mine. 
 That gun fires .40 caliber rounds... same as the slugs they pulled from your ex-girlfriend, Nicole. 
 Nicole was shot? 
 Don't act like you didn't know. 
 I... I didn't. I swear. 
 We know you threatened Nicole after she outed you to her friends. 
 We found these. 
 "Rot in hell." 
 And my favorite: "I'll end you." 
 You sent that last one a couple hours before Nicole was gunned down. 
 They're just words. 
 I... I didn't really mean it. 
 I never would have actually hurt her. 
 We can place you in Lower Manhattan around the time of Nicole's murder. 
 I was making deliveries. 
 Some of those Wall Street guys like to go straight from work to the club. 
 Don't suppose any of your customers would be willing to confirm that? 
 Admit it, Conroy, you were pissed. 
 You spent months using Nicole to cultivate new clients. 
 She killed your access, so you killed her. 
 I was upset. 
 She embarrassed me, but I had nothing to do with her murder. 
 Then what was the gun for? 
 Protection. 
 I got robbed by a supplier a few months ago. 
 That's why I ran. I had no idea Nicole was dead. 
 Sit tight. 
 Hey, ballistics came back on Conroy's gun. 
 It's not the murder weapon, plus... 
 The doorman's got Conroy leaving his building last night at 7:40. 
 There's no way he could have made it from his apartment in Long Island City to Foley Square in 13 minutes. 
 Guys, I just ran the ballistics through NIBIN. 
 Rifling on the bullet they pulled from Nicole matches another bullet NYPD recovered from a shooting in the Bronx yesterday morning. 
 So we've got two victims shot by the same killer on the same day. 
 Our shooter's on a killing spree. 
 So our shooter has killed two people in a 24-hour period. 
 Now, it's entirely possible he's hiding out... that he's done whatever he set out to do. 
 But we have to assume that he is still out there searching for his next victim. Yes, yes. 
 Our first priority is to catch this guy before another body drops. 
 Let's start by figuring out how he's choosing his victims. 
 And does he have an agenda, or is he targeting people at random? 
 Now, our second victim is Leo Ramirez, the leader of the Los Caballeros, the violent Dominican street gang. 
 Ramirez was shot in East Concourse at 8:20 a.m. yesterday morning. 
 A witness told detectives that the shooter was African-American but couldn't give a description. 
 PD's been shaking down the usual suspects. 
 So far, no leads. 
 What do Mitchell and Ramirez have in common? 
 What's the connection between the two? 
 Zero contact over phone or social media. 
 No friends or followers in common. 
 There's absolutely nothing to suggest they've ever met before. 
 Los Caballeros is a major player in the cocaine trade. 
 Could be overlap with Nicole's drug-dealing ex-boyfriend. 
 Explore that... find out if Ramirez or his gang ever crossed paths with Todd Conroy. 
 And what about Nicole's time as a public defender? 
 Was Ramirez ever a client? 
 No, I checked the court records. 
 I also spoke to her supervisor who said she wasn't aware of any threats made against Nicole during her time at the defender's office. 
 Well, keep digging, and someone reach out to the homicide detectives working the Ramirez case. 
 Ramirez took four rounds to the chest at close range. 
 Bled out before the ambulance got here. 
 Witness was in her apartment at the time. 
 She saw the suspect approach Ramirez, the two exchange words, then the suspect shot Ramirez and took off in his car. 
 Did she hear what they said? 
 Nah, she was too far away to really make it out... something about wanting a name. 
 Word on the street is the shooter was a Blood. 
 They've been battling for control of this area. 
 But you don't agree? 
 Gang unit's got a guy in deep with the Bloods. 
 Says even they were surprised by this. 
 Are you thinking an inside job? 
 Ramirez was head of Los Caballeros for the better part of a decade. 
 He's got enemies from here to Santo Domingo, and I'm not just talking about other gangs. 
 A lot of people in this community lost their kids to gang violence. 
 These security cameras catch the shooting? 
 No, none of them were aimed this way. 
 Thanks. 
 Bus was scheduled to be here around the time of the shooting. 
 Maybe the dash cam caught something. 
 There... car goes by two minutes before the shooting. 
 Can you get a plate? Yep, running it now. 
 Okay, looks like he stole the tags off a Ford Fusion. 
 All right, run it through the DAS. 
 See if it's been picked up by any license plate readers. 
 Got a hit. It's been scanned by a patrol car 20 minutes ago on Broadway and Clinton heading west. 
 Great, call Maggie and OA. 
 It's over there. 
 Still warm. Couldn't have gotten far. 
 Unless he boosted another car. 
 No surveillance cams. 
 Hey, can you sweep the neighborhood? 
 Keep an eye out for any stolen cars, anyone that looks suspicious. 
 Trunk's open. 
 So, you gonna tell me what's been bothering you? 
 Nothing. So you've been saying. 
 Come on, Maggie, I'm your partner. 
 You've been off ever since you had that meeting last night. 
 The Assistant Director in Charge asked to see me. 
 What'd he want? 
 He has an assignment... undercover deal. 
 He didn't give me all the details, but he said it's a pretty big case. 
 Guess I fit the profile they're looking for. 
 He said it could be good for my career. 
 What'd you tell him? 
 Said I'd think about it. And? 
 Just seems like the more I think about it, the harder the decision is to make. 
 Hey, OA. 
 What is it? 
 It's a docket number to a district court case. 
 Look, TM... Thurgood Marshall courthouse. 
 That's only a few blocks away from here. 
 What if the shooter's going after someone involved in the case? 
 Well, it's 2:45, so that means we only have 15 minutes. 
 Okay, let me see this. 
 According to court records, the case is United States vs. Anatoly Adurov. 
 That's Mona's case. She's the prosecutor. 
 Okay. 
 She's still not answering. 
 There, OA, it's Mona. 
 Gun! Mona! 
 Take the shot! I can't! 
 There's too many civilians. 
 Maggie, stay with her. 
 PD's canvassing the area, but so far, no sign of him. 
 There's a good chance he made it onto the subway. 
 Well, that means he could be anywhere in the city right now. 
 Tell me we at least got his face on camera. 
 Not enough for facial rec. 
 You think you can give a description to a sketch artist? 
 No, I didn't get a good enough look at him. 
 I don't think it's broken, but you'll need an X-ray to be sure. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 You okay? 
 I am thanks to you and Maggie. 
 Are you sure? I'm fine. 
 What is going on, Omar? 
 Do you remember a lawyer named Nicole Mitchell? 
 Yeah, we tried a few cases against one another. 
 Okay, well, she was killed at a protest here last night. 
 Whoever killed Nicole also killed a gangbanger, Leo Ramirez. 
 Wait, are you saying the same person just tried to kill me? 
 Well, the shooter has a hit list, and it looks like you're on it. 
 Can you think of any reason someone would want to target the three of you? 
 And did you know Ramirez? 
 I did. 
 I had a murder trial a while back. 
 It was a hit on a senior member of the Crips. 
 Gang unit was sure Ramirez had ordered it, but the only guy who was charged was a 16-year-old kid driving the getaway car. 
 And Nicole... she represented him? 
 He was a local basketball star. 
 Cops caught him fleeing the scene. 
 Shooter wasn't in the car. 
 I did everything I could to persuade the kid to give him up, but he wouldn't talk. 
 So what happened to the kid? 
 My boss wanted to send a message. 
 He pushed me to try him as an adult. 
 Nicole got scared. 
 She knew that if her case went to trial, her client could end up doing life, so she convinced him to take a deal... conspiracy, four years. 
 Okay, what's the kid's name? 
 Alex Bryant. 
 Okay, people, we have a suspect, and his name is Alex Bryant. 
 Bryant spent the last four years in Otisville. 
 He was released two weeks ago, and the question is, did Bryant get out of prison with a hit list? 
 Is he looking to get revenge on the people that put him inside? So let's dig into this kid. 
 Can we place him at any of the crime scenes? 
 No, his cell's been turned off for the last two days. 
 All right, let's update the BOLO to include his mug shot, and tell PD to approach with caution. 
 Hey, let's make a list of all the people involved in Bryant's case. 
 I want everyone put under protection until we have him in custody. 
 We figured out where Bryant's been living? 
 Yes, his probation officer says he's living with his dad in Morris Heights. 
 Oh, great... text Maggie and OA the address. 
 Alex hasn't been home since early yesterday. 
 He and his dad got into it. He took off. 
 What were they fighting about? 
 Don't know. I was in the shower. 
 But Alex hasn't been the same since he got out. 
 Used to be such a happy kid. 
 Now he's just angry all the time. 
 Can I ask what this is about? 
 Yeah, we need to speak with him over an incident that happened yesterday morning. 
 Do you have any idea where he may have gone? 
 Probably crashed at his friend Benny's. 
 Benny's the only one Alex stayed tight with after he went away. 
 I know they hung out a couple of nights ago. 
 Does Alex have access to any guns? 
 We don't own any weapons... 
 Selina, don't say another word. 
 Mr. Bryant, I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell. 
 This is my partner, OA Zidan. 
 We're looking for your son, Alex. 
 What are you accusing him of now? 
 We would just like to talk to him. 
 Yeah, same thing the cops said four years ago. 
 Do you know where he is? Yes or no? 
 I wouldn't tell you even if I did, so unless you got a warrant, you can get the hell up out of here. 
 Well, Mr. Bryan, we think that your son may be in some serious trouble. 
 Let me tell you something. My boy was a good kid. 
 He had 15 scholarships, 15. 
 Could've gone pro, but, like a dog, y'all lock him up in a cage, so please don't come up in here pretending like you care about Alex. 
 We do care about the families of the people he has killed and the ones he is trying to kill. 
 Please leave before I file a complaint. 
 Hey, call Kristen. Get her to look into that kid Benny. 
 Stepmom said they were hanging out the night before the shooting. 
 Maybe he knows where Alex is. 
 I haven't seen or heard from Alex since that night. 
 Did Alex seem upset about anything? 
 Yeah, he was upset. 
 Just found out he'd never play college hoops. 
 Surprise, surprise... all those coaches kissing his ass before the arrest won't even take his calls. 
 And all over a trumped up charge? 
 What do you mean "trumped up"? 
 Everyone knew Alex wasn't in a gang back then. 
 He was a baller, man. He didn't sell drugs. 
 He told the cops he didn't know the other guy in the car was gonna shoot someone. 
 Thought they was just gonna get a burger. 
 So Alex in some kind of trouble? 
 Well, we think he may be going after the people he blames for putting him in prison. 
 Ramirez... 
 You think Alex killed Ramirez? 
 Not just Ramirez, his public defender too. 
 Benny... 
 You gotta tell us what you know. 
 I don't know anything. 
 Still in that gang? 
 Nah, I'm out that life. 
 That's smart. Only two ways that book ends, right? 
 Prison or a grave. 
 Now you're on the other side working security. 
 Get to carry a gun. 
 Yeah, it makes us wonder. 
 Mm-mm, maybe you loaned Alex one of your guns. 
 If you did, and if one of your guns comes back connected to the murders or the shootings, you will be tied up in this, Benny. 
 That night, after Alex and I hung out, one of my guns got stolen... the one I keep in my car. 
 Maybe Alex took it when he left my place. 
 What kind of gun was it? 
 Glock 22. 
 Same caliber as the murder weapon. 
 We gotta go. 
 If you hear from Alex, give us a call. 
 NYPD blue and white just said they spotted someone fitting Alex's description running into an abandoned warehouse half a mile from here. SWAT's already on the way. 
 FBI! 
 Hey. 
 This is a shooting gallery. 
 FBI, show me your hands. Hey! 
 
 
 
 It's Alex, OA. 
 He's not breathing. 
 We need a medic now. 
 Come on, Alex. 
 Alex, I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell. 
 This is my partner OA Zidan. We're with the FBI Like to ask you a couple questions. 
 Can you tell us where you were the last couple of days? 
 Around. Hm. 
 Were you around lower Manhattan? 
 No. 
 Sure about that? 
 'Cause we have a dead body that says otherwise... your lawyer Nicole Mitchell. 
 I don't know anything about that. 
 Well, we think you do. 
 We also think you know about the murder of Leo Ramirez and the attempted murder of a federal prosecutor. 
 Okay, Alex, look, I get it. You got screwed four years ago. 
 You get into a car with a buddy, and suddenly, you're doing four years for conspiracy to commit a murder. 
 You don't know what you're talking about, man. 
 I know you were headed to college on a basketball scholarship, but you ended up in prison instead as a 16-year-old kid. 
 We read your prison file. 
 We know what happened to you on the inside. 
 Alex, I can't imagine how horrible that would have been. 
 I was trying to do the right thing. 
 We get that, and the judge will too, but you have to come clean and tell us what happened. 
 I didn't kill anyone, man. I swear to God. 
 We know about the gun. 
 We know you stole it from Benny, so what did you do with it? 
 Somebody took it from me. 
 Who? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay, Alex, we wanna help you, but we can't do that unless you help us first. 
 I said I don't know, all right? 
 You wanna put me back in prison? 
 Go ahead. 
 Alex Bryant is not talking. 
 We need to prove this is our guy, but right now, we can't place him at any of the shootings. 
 There's no murder weapon. 
 All we have is this theoretical revenge motive, which is not enough to indict let alone convict. 
 Come on, Kelly. 
 You guys keep digging through that video footage. 
 I'll buy you each a candy bar if you find this guy on camera. 
 Hey, ERT find anything in the car? 
 No useable prints or DNA. 
 He's a junkie. I'm not buying he didn't slip up, people. 
 Hospital sent over Alex's clothes. 
 Tell me there's GSR. 
 No, but there was a ticket from a pawn shop in his pocket. 
 It didn't say what was pawned, but the shop has a previous firearms violation. 
 Could be that he pawned the murder weapon. 
 Yeah, great, take Emily, check it out. 
 I'll go check in with Mona, see if she remembers anything else about Alex's case. 
 Yep. 
 Doctors say it's just a bad sprain. 
 Oh, that's good. 
 I heard you arrested Alex. I did. 
 That's why I called. 
 Just trying to wrap my brain around a few things. 
 I thought maybe you'd be able to help. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 So I read his file. 
 Alex was driving the car, but he told the police that he had no idea his unnamed friend was gonna shoot a gang member. 
 Yeah, the old "I didn't know my criminal friend was about to commit a crime" defense. 
 And you didn't buy that? 
 Show me your friends, I'll show you your future. 
 That's a little preachy. 
 I mean, just because Bryant's friend is a punk doesn't mean that he's a punk. 
 Was there other evidence that he was a bad kid? 
 What are you getting at? 
 It's just... 
 If he was really guilty, he should be celebrating the fact that he only got four years, looking forward to new beginnings, not out killing people. 
 Bryant knew what was about to go down. 
 You don't just get into a car with a gang member. 
 I don't know about that. 
 Mona, I mean, where Bryant is from... where I'm from... you kind of do get into the car with drug dealers and gang members because those are the kids that you went to elementary school with, the kids that you play basketball with, so I'm not really sure that I agree with your premise. 
 Do I think it's possible that Bryant had no idea what was going to happen when he got into that car? 
 Sure. 
 But that doesn't make him innocent. 
 I mean, he knew who the killer was and didn't say anything. 
 All right, I don't care where you grow up. 
 That's wrong. 
 Tell me. 
 Well, Alex didn't pawn a gun. 
 He pawned a watch and some jewelry. 
 Uh-huh. When was this? 
 The same day our two victims were killed. 
 I just found a police report of a mugging in the same vicinity as the pawn shop a night before the shootings. 
 A couple says an African-American male robbed them at gunpoint and made off with their valuables. 
 Right, so maybe this was him needing money for dope. 
 Guys? Yeah. 
 I checked surveillance footage. 
 Alex was at the pawn shop at the same time Ramirez was gunned down. 
 There's no way Alex could have killed him. 
 All right, ladies and gentlemen, it appears Alex Bryant has an alibi for Ramirez's killing, and, since we know the same shooter killed Nicole Mitchell, we can rule him out for that one too. 
 Can we make it a trifecta? 
 Yeah, I tracked Alex via street cams. 
 After he left the pawn shop, he went straight to the shooting gallery... didn't leave till after the attack on Mona. 
 So if Alex isn't the killer, then who is? 
 Has to be someone with the same motive. 
 Well, his father was pretty upset when we talked to him yesterday. 
 He's got all the same reasons to be angry with anyone involved in Alex's case. 
 His kid was gonna be someone. Now he's just another ex-con. 
 And at the hospital, Alex said that someone took Benny's gun. 
 We know that he fought with his father the morning of the shooting. 
 Maybe he took it from him then. 
 We got a cell number for Roman Bryant? 
 I was just checking cell site records now. 
 Roman's phone pinged off towers in the vicinity of all three shootings. 
 Get a warrant. 
 Roman Bryant, FBI! 
 Clear! Clear! 
 He's not here. 
 In here. 
 Left that for his wife. 
 "I'm sorry I couldn't say good-bye. 
 "Hope you'll understand why I had to do this. 
 I love you." 
 Sounds like a suicide note, but I don't see a body. 
 You don't need that many bullets if you're just planning to off yourself. 
 He's going after more targets. 
 Roman Bryant is in the wind with a bunch of ammo and a burning desire to kill everyone he blames for ruining his kid's life. 
 I want updates on every protective detail, please. 
 And where are we with the judge? 
 We track him down yet? 
 He's on vacation in St. Lucia, won't be back for another week. 
 Okay, and what about the locations of the correction officers? 
 They're both working a nine to five shift. 
 Hm. 
 Hey. Yeah? 
 I've been going through Roman's location data. 
 Ever since the attack on Mona, he's been spending a lot of time in the Bronx. 
 Maybe he's looking for someone there. 
 The fact we don't have another body means he hasn't found the next person on his list. 
 Question is, who is that person? 
 Right. 
 You know what? Let's talk to his son. 
 Maybe he knows. Okay. 
 I thought I made it clear, all right? 
 I'm done talking. What's the point? 
 No one believes me anyway. 
 Yeah, Alex, look, we know that you didn't kill anyone. 
 But your dad did. 
 He's the one who took the gun, isn't he? 
 Look, Alex, I get trying to protect your dad, but it's too late for that. 
 He left a note for your stepmom. 
 He's gonna go kill other people and then kill himself. 
 We need to know. Who's he going after? 
 Now's not the time to keep your mouth shut. 
 Alex, who else does your dad blame for what happened to you? 
 Himself. 
 He blames himself. 
 My dad's the one who told me to keep my mouth shut. 
 Ramirez said he'd kill our whole family, but that if I kept quiet, he promised to protect me in prison. 
 But he didn't keep that promise, did he? 
 My dad had no idea what happened to me on the inside, and I wasn't about to tell him. 
 Until two days ago when you guys fought? 
 He didn't understand. 
 He didn't know why I was so... 
 Screwed up. 
 So you told him. 
 Yeah. 
 I told him everything. 
 I'd never seen him so angry. 
 No, my dad's a good man. 
 All he ever wanted for me was a better life than he had. 
 He taught me how to play ball, took me to all my practices, worked double shifts to pay for my sneakers. 
 But the thought of his son... getting raped... 
 It made him crazy. 
 Crazy enough to go after the person you protected four years ago? 
 If you don't tell us, he will end up dead. 
 Do you want that? 
 It was Benny, all right? He's going after Benny. 
 Thank you. 
 Roman's going after Benny Delgado. 
 Who's got eyes on Benny? 
 Patrol went by his apartment and work... no sign of him. 
 Well, he probably knows Roman's looking for him, so he's laying low. 
 Jubal. Yeah. 
 Roman's cell just pinged off a tower in Norwood. 
 Norwood, Norwood... hold on. 
 Benny's aunt owns a house up there... 
 220th and Detroit. 
 Nice. 
 That's him. 
 Stop right there, Roman. 
 Suspect's on foot headed north in the alley. 
 Get back in the house! 
 Hey, go around back. 
 Do not come any closer! 
 Let her go, Roman. 
 Listen, I don't wanna hurt her, okay? 
 I... I just want Benny! 
 That's not gonna happen! 
 Put the gun down. 
 Look, we just wanna talk to you. 
 Talk? No, no, no. 
 Ain't nothing to talk about. 
 I know you blame yourself, but this isn't your fault. 
 Look, what choice did you have? 
 Ramirez threatened you. 
 You just did what you thought was right for your family. 
 You couldn't have known that Alex would've been tried as an adult, or that it would all turn out like this. 
 No, no, no. 
 Roman... 
 You didn't let Alex down, the system did. 
 You don't understand. 
 I let them take my boy. 
 He'll never be the same... 
 Great work today, everybody. 
 Roman Bryant signed a full confession, and because of all of you, I get to tell Nicole Mitchell's father that we caught his daughter's killer. 
 Well, drinks on me. 
 Oh, look at you, high roller. 
 Oh, you know, might have a little something socked away from my Wall Street days. 
 Just not that place on Canal. 
 Bartender keeps asking for my number. 
 Hey, OA. 
 I just wanted to let you know. 
 I took the assignment. 
 It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. 
 When do you start? 
 Tomorrow. 
 I don't suppose there's any chance I can talk you out of it? 
 I figured you would say that. 
 I was worried I would cave, so I already told the ADIC. 
 I'll be back before you know it. 
 Well, you better be. 
 Just be safe. 
 Yeah, you too. 
 Okay, go, go. They're waiting on you.
