 I was never married, but we were together a long time. 
 They live with their mom in Puerto Rico,  so I don't get to see them as often as I would like. 
 Hey, I was gonna tell you sooner, okay? 
 I just--I just wanted us to be further along.

 Hey, hey. 
 - It's Jubal. 
 I have to go. 
 - Her five-year-old, Grace Harris,  was abducted from a cabin in Harriman State Park  a little over an hour ago. 
 Mother called it in, said they were on a family trip--  Just Grace, her parents, and her aunt and uncle. 
 - So where were the adults when she was taken? 
 - Just outside the cabin, sitting around a campfire. 
 Every parent's worst nightmare,right? 
 - Yeah. 
 What do we know about the family? 
 - Her parents are Ben and Rhonda Harris,  both 32 years old, live on the Upper West Side. 
 She is an investment banker with Pinnacle Financial. 
 He's a defense attorney with Kagan & Greene. 
 - We think they were targeted? 
 - Well, no ransom demand. 
 The girl was abductedfar away from home, so... 
 - All right, let's focus on the surrounding area for now. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Send the K-9 Unit. 
 Let's get canvases started. 
 - Okay. 
 Maggie and OA aresetting up a mobile unit now. 
 - Okay, everybody, listen up! 
 We have a five-year-old girl  who has been missing for two hours now. 
 We all know the deal: longer she's gone,  the worse her chances get. 
 Scola, how we doing? 
 - Rangers took a team to cover the west ends of the ground. 
 I'm headed east with this group now. 
 - Agent Zidan. 
 - Yes? 
 Trooper Gates, state police. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 - I need you and your guysgoing door-to-door  to neighboring towns;get Grace's photo out there,  see if anyone's seenanything unusual. 
 - Got it. 
 - Ah, Trooper Gates. 
 Start withthe s*x offender registry  in case we're dealingwith an opportunist. 
 - We'll check it out. 
 - K-9. 
 - Where do you need us? 
 - I need youat the abduction site. 
 We need a full forensic sweepof the family's cabin. 
 [overlapping voices] 
 Okay? 
 All right, let's get to work. 
 ♪  - Hey. 
 What did you see when you were last inside? 
 - Uh, I went into Grace's roomto check on her,  and it--the room was freezing. 
 And so I saw thatthe window was open, and... 
 I just can't believethis is happening. 
 We were checking on herevery 30 minutes. 
 - Okay, who was the last person to see Grace? 
 - I was. 
 I checked on her around 8:30. 
 She was fine. 
 - We should've neverleft her alone. 
 - Honey, we were right outside. 
 There was nobody else here. 
 - Someone was here. 
 Someone was here,and they took our daughter. 
 - [stammers silently] 
 - Okay. 
 Have you seen anyone else around? 
 both: No. 
 - Did you hear any voices? 
 Maybe something out of the ordinary? 
 - No, no, no. 
 - No, we had music playing. 
 - Okay. 
 Look, at this point,  this is looking like a crime of opportunity,  but I've gotta ask you,  is there anybody who's wanted to hurt either of you? 
 - No. 
 - No disgruntled employees or unhappy clients? 
 - No, no, no, nothing like that. 
 We don't have any enemies. 
 - Yeah, no. 
 - Excuse me. 
 This your daughter's? 
 - Yes. 
 - Yeah. 
 Why are they takingher toothbrush? 
 - Standard procedure. 
 - It's for DNA, right? 
 In case they need to identify her? 
 Which could mean that she's... 
 [voice breaks] 
 - Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Don't go there. 
 - Mrs. 
 Harris, Mr. 
 Harris,  we are doing everything we can to find your daughter. 
 In the meantime,  I think it's important that you guys get settled into a hotel. 
 It's really importantthat we can get a hold of you  in case something comes up. 
 both: Yeah. 
 - Thank you. 
 [agent shouts indistinctly] 
 - So show me exactly whereyou all were sitting. 
 - Nicole and I were here,  and then Ben and Rhonda were on that bench. 
 - Facing the cabin? 
 - Rhonda wanted to see the door just in case Grace got up,  but we never thought... 
 - No, of course not. 
 So Rhonda wentto check on Grace,  and the three of youstayed out here? 
 - And then about a minute later,  we heard Rhonda screaming so we ran inside,  and that's when we realized what had happened. 
 - And have you seen anyonein this area? 
 - No. 
 We went outlooking for Grace,  but we didn't see anyone. 
 - And do you know if there's anyone else  staying out here anywhere nearby? 
 - There was a man when we first got here. 
 I saw him when I was getting the firewood. 
 - Do you remember what he looked like? 
 - Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 - Scola, let's be on the lookout for a white male,  dark hair, slender, last seen wearing a red flannel shirt. 
 - One step ahead of you, Tiff. 
 All right, OA, we got an abandoned campsite out here. 
 It's about a 1/4 mile east of the abduction site. 
 Fire's still going, so it's recent,  but no sign of whoever camped here. 
 - Okay, so who's taking off in the middle of the night  with search parties and helicopters all over the place? 
 - I hear you, man. 
 You getting anything from the drone? 
 - No. 
 Nothing near you. 
 Hold on. 
 I might have something. 
 Hey, Maggie, are you still at the abduction site? 
 - Yeah, I'm here. 
 What's up? 
 - Okay, I have a drone picking up a heat signature  about 1/2 mile north of you,  far end of the rock formation. 
 - Okay, copy. 
 We're on our way. 
 - Grace? 
 - Search team, advance... 
 - OA, we're getting close. 
 Any eyes on our guy? 
 - He is 30 yards ahead on your right. 
 - Up ahead! 
 - Copy that. 
 Stand by. 
 ♪  - FBI! 
 Don't move! 
 - Tango at six o'clock! 
 Let's go! 
 - Don't move! 
 - We got a runner! 
 - [breathing heavily] 
 - Suspect on foot! 
 [both grunting, search team shouting] 
 - [shouts] 
 - Hey! 
 - [grunting] 
 - We need an ID on the man in this photo. 
 Maggie and OA have him in custody,  but he doesn't have any identification on him,  and he refuses to state his name. 
 - Jub, I'm running facial rec now. 
 - Thank you. 
 - And we got him. 
 - Yeah? 
 - Don Kirkpatrick. 
 47 years old. 
 - I'm guessing by all the mugshots,  he's got quite a rap sheet. 
 - Public intoxication, aggravated assault,  resisting arrest. 
 - He's got an outstanding warrant too. 
 Broke into his ex-wife's house to see his kid two months ago. 
 Took off before the cops arrived. 
 She filed an order of protection against him  for child abuse. 
 - Right. 
 All right, let's get everything we have over to Maggie and OA,  see if they can get this dirtbag to start talking. 
 - [angrily] 
 Where is she, Don? 
 I cannot help you unless you cooperate. 
 Where did you take her? 
 - Look, man, I've seen your rap sheet. 
 You have an outstanding warrant. 
 You really wanna tack on a kidnapping charge? 
 Huh? 
 A jury would not blink to convict a guy like you,  someone who abuses his own kid. 
 - I never abused my kid, ever! 
 I never touched that little girl either. 
 But I may have seen the guy that did. 
 - Okay. 
 Would you like to tell us what happened,  what you saw? 
 - Yeah, she was with some man out in the woods,  and, uh... 
 he was pulling her by her arm. 
 I saw her with her family earlier. 
 I knew where she lived,  so I went there to see what was going on,  but when I got there,  I saw that the parents were panicking, and... 
 I knew they were gonna call the cops, so... 
 I didn't want nothing to do with it. 
 - Well, that is very noble of you, sir. 
 - You said that you saw the girl  outside of the cabin in the woods? 
 Where? 
 - Down by the pond. 
 I heard them there... 
 [cell phone haptics clacking] 
 But I kept back. 
 I stayed out of sight, and I saw the guy. 
 He, uh... 
 he was struggling with the girl,  and she didn't want nothing to do with him. 
 - Did you get a good look at him? 
 - It was too dark. 
 - According to park maps,  there's a utility road on the north side of the pond. 
 So if Kirkpatrick's telling the truth,  then the kidnapper could've been taking Grace to a car. 
 - Looks like someone was headed this way. 
 Can we get a marker over here? 
 - You got it. 
 ♪  [camera app clicking] 
 [search team talking indistinctly] 
 - ...body of water... 
 - Scola? 
 We got blood. 
 - Is this, uh-- first marker here, huh? 
 - Yeah, we'll start here. 
 ♪  - Okay, we should get this to the lab right away. 
 - We got a couple of divers flying in... 
 - Get your placard in the shot, yeah? 
 ♪  - Hey, check it out. 
 [music swells] 
 ♪  [phone line trilling] 
 - Hey. 
 What's going on? 
 - Yeah, Jubal, it's Scola. 
 We're gonna need a dive team out here. 
 - All right, dive team has started a grid search  on the pond, but in the meantime,  we need to proceed as if she's still alive. 
 So in the spirit of optimism, let's keep working. 
 [sighs] 
 What do we have? 
 - Lab says the shoe print Scola found  isn't distinct enough to run down. 
 It's a size 12. 
 That's three sizes too large to be Don Kirkpatrick's. 
 - Which means there was someone else out there. 
 - Yeah, well, they're gonna book him  on the outstanding warrant,  but ERT didn't find any evidence in his tent  or in the area where Maggie apprehended him. 
 It doesn't seem like he was involved. 
 - Mm. 
 - We can confirm the blood on the rock is Grace's. 
 It matched to the DNA from the toothbrush. 
 - [sighing] 
 Right. 
 Anything from the doll? 
 - Two latent prints. 
 One of a child's, presumably Grace's. 
 The other of her father's, Ben Harris. 
 - So that's a dead end. 
 - Not necessarily. 
 Something popped when we ran her dad's fingerprints. 
 - What do you mean? 
 - On the surface, Ben is clean. 
 But he changed his legal name 13 years ago. 
 He has a sealed juvenile record  and a past felony conviction. 
 - For what? 
 - Murder. 
 When he was 12, he killed a ten-year-old girl... 
 In the woods. 
 - Same crime, same location. 
 Could just be an ugly coincidence,  but let's see what else you can dig up! 
 We need to know who this little girl's father really is. 
 - Ben Harris was born Corbin Howard. 
 He grew up in the Bronx. 
 He was raised by his grandmother  until he was convicted of murder as a juvenile. 
 He was 12 years old. 
 He spent six years at the Horizon Juvenile Center  in the Bronx. 
 He was released on his 18th birthday. 
 - Well, that is an odd coincidence,  but we really think it's relevant  to his daughter's disappearance? 
 - Well, there are some similarities between the cases. 
 You wanna... 
 - The victim's name was Lucy Parkin. 
 She and Ben went to the same summer camp  in the Catskills in July of 2000,  and witnesses said that, on the day of the murder,  he lured her deep into the woods, away from the group,  shoved her off the side of a cliff. 
 She fell 28 feet, died a few hours later. 
 - Okay. 
 Is there any evidence  that actually suggest he's involved in this current case? 
 - Well, nothing concrete,  but he was the last person to have contact with Grace  before she went missing. 
 And he also has a sealed psychiatric record  from his time at Youth Authority. 
 - Right. 
 HIPAA laws prevent us from seeing what was in it,  but if he was struggling with mental illness,  being in the same environment as the original trauma,  it could've trigged him, sent him down a dark path. 
 - All right. 
 Have Maggie and OA go question him. 
 - Yeah. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 [knocks at door] 
 - Hi. 
 Come in. 
 Did you find something? 
 - Mrs. 
 Harris, is your husband here? 
 - No, he went out for a drive. 
 He said he needed to clear his head. 
 - When did he leave? 
 - About 45 minutes ago. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Do you know who took Grace? 
 - We don't have any more information right now,  but we have a search team out there  doing everything that they can. 
 Um, can you call Ben now? 
 It'd be better if we could speak  to both of you at the same time. 
 - Yeah. 
 [cell phone beeping]

 It's going straight to voicemail. 
 His phone must've died.

 Ben Harris isn't at the hotel. 
 His phone's off. 
 He went for a drive. 
 I think he went radio silent. 
 - You think he's running? 
 - I'm not sure,  but I saw some shoes in his suitcase. 
 He's a size 12. 
 - Okay, listen up, everybody! 
 Ben Harris, the victim's father,  just became a suspect. 
 I need a current location for him ASAP. 
 I wanna pull his financials, his cell records,  and let's put a BOLO out on the family car. 
 OA, listen up. 
 Talk to the wife. 
 See if he said anything to her  that can help us figure out where he might be going. 
 - Copy that. 
 - Before Ben left, how was he doing? 
 - He's terrified. 
 Our daughter's missing. 
 Why? 
 - I just wanted to make sure he's doing okay. 
 He's been gone a while now. 
 What about the last two weeks? 
 Has Ben seemed unusually stressed? 
 - No. 
 - Did he seem agitated in the woods? 
 - No. 
 Why would he be agitated in the woods? 
 Wait, you guys don't think  that he had something to do with it... 
 Do you? 
 - Given his history. 
 - What history? 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 ♪  - As a defense attorney. 
 - Oh. 
 - Just assuming that he's made some enemies in past cases. 
 - No. 
 Like I said before, we don't have any enemies.

 Maggie, we gotta go. 
 I just got a text. 
 But we will need to talk to him. 
 Standard procedure. 
 So please give us a call when he gets here. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 [door clicks open] 
 - I can't believe she doesn't know about the murder. 
 How do you hide something like that from your wife? 
 - I'm guessing that's a pretty difficult topic  to just bring up. 
 - I get it, but she deserves to know. 
 - Well, you're right, but we're not marriage counselors. 
 We just gotta keep her calm and focused. 
 - Unless Ben is involved. 
 - In that case, it's too late to matter. 
 - Jubal, I just got off the phone with Ben Harris's bank. 
 - Yeah. 
 - He withdrew $140,000  from a branch two miles away from the camp ground. 
 - When was this? 
 - Five minutes ago. 
 Branch manager said he was in a hurry. 
 - What's the address? 
 - Bank of America Financial Center in Haverstraw. 
 232 Liberty Drive. 
 - All right. 
 Pull traffic cams. 
 See if you can figure out which way he's headed. 
 Maggie, it's Jubal. 
 Are you and OA still at the Harris's hotel? 
 - Yeah, we're leaving now. 
 What's up? 
 - Ben Harris just hit up a Bank of America in Haverstraw. 
 It's five minutes away from you. 
 The address is... 
 - Hey, he's here. 
 - At the hotel? 
 - Yeah. 
 Jubal, he's pulling up.

 - Ben, stop! 
 - [grunts] 
 - Ben Harris, you're under arrest  for resisting federal agents! 
 - They're gonna kill my daughter! 
 - What do you mean? 
 Who's gonna kill your daughter? 
 - The people who sent me this. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 - It's a ransom demand. 
 "$200K by sundown or she dies."  - Please. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 - Okay. 
 Come on. 
 Get up. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 - All right, everybody, listen up. 
 We have a ransom demand and a photo that proves  Grace Harris was alive when she left the campground. 
 Looks like she has a pretty nasty gash on her leg,  which explains the bloody rock at the crime scene. 
 Otherwise, she appears to be in good health--  based on the photo, at least. 
 - This is now a targeted crime scene. 
 The abductors knew whose child they have  and how much they can ask for. 
 - The kidnapper texted Ben Harris. 
 So he has his cell number. 
 - Yeah, but he had him ditch his personal cell right away  to avoid tracking. 
 He sent him to park in Haverstraw to pick up a burner. 
 - That's the phone the photo of the girl was on,  the one they're using to communicate with Ben. 
 - And what about the money drop? 
 Timing? 
 Location? 
 - Nothing yet. 
 - Okay, so you guys'll head up to Haverstraw  and check the park for cameras,  witnesses who might've seen our perp  dropping off the burner phone. 
 - How about the burner itself? 
 Did we run it for prints? 
 - Yeah, it's clean. 
 - Except for Ben's. 
 But the messaging is encrypted. 
 Cellular Survey is on-site  downloading everything they can. 
 ♪  - I know this is a lot to process, Ben,  but from an investigative perspective,  proof of life in a ransom demand is encouraging. 
 - The kidnappers want something, all right? 
 So they're gonna need to keep Grace safe to get it. 
 - Why didn't you call us after you got that text? 
 - I was just following instructions. 
 It said not to tell anyone. 
 You thought it was me, didn't you? 
 That I'd hurt my daughter? 
 - Yes. 
 But that's only because most abduction cases  are perpetrated by a parent... 
 and, given your criminal history,  it raised a few red flags. 
 - "Criminal history"? 
 You're talking about Lucy Parkin. 
 - We had to consider it a possibility. 
 - Yeah, well, it was an accident. 
 I didn't mean to kill that girl. 
 - Mr. 
 Harris, unfortunately, we don't have time  to adjudicate your past. 
 - No. 
 Please. 
 I know... 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 But I was at that camp on a scholarship  and stuck out like a sore thumb,  and Lucy and her friends, they made sure I knew it. 
 Then one day I went on a walk,  and Lucy followed me,  starting taunting me,  told me I didn't really belong at that camp. 
 And I... 
 I shoved her... 
 hard. 
 It was just a reflex, and sh...

 - Fine. 
 But you can't tell her. 
 You can't tell her about this.

 I did six years at juvie. 
 I studied my ass off to get into college  and start fresh. 
 By the time I met Rhonda, I just--  I just wanted to leave all this behind  in the past.

 No secrets.

 - Yeah. 
 - No secrets.

 Harris, I know this sounds scary,  but the FBI has a lot of experience doing ransom drops. 
 We'll make sure this goes down smoothly.

 That is $60K short of the ransom.

 That's a big risk. 
 - So is showing up with the feds  when they told us to come alone.

 - There's a parking lot camera across the street. 
 This jackass may not be keeping track  of who comes in to this place. 
 I'll bet you that thing is. 
 [handcuffs click open] 
 - So camera one is from the parking lot  across from the security store,  camera two is outside the Harris house,  and camera three is just down the block from Ben's office. 
 The thing that caught our attention  is that there's an SNY Energy van  at all three locations. 
 - Seemed normal at first. 
 Common service vehicle. 
 But the Harris's house  is outside the company's service area. 
 - So you think somebody's been using it as a cover  to follow Ben? 
 Do we have an ID on the driver? 
 - No, but according to SNY's records,  the van wasn't even in use at those times. 
 The technician it's assigned to was out of town on vacation. 
 - Where do they think it was? 
 - Parked in their lot in Harlem. 
 - And we had the company send over a full list of personnel  with access to that lot. 
 Scola and Tiffany are combing through it now. 
 - I think we got something. 
 - SNY records show  that the same employee swiped into the lot  each time the van showed up  anywhere near the Harris family. 
 - A mechanic named Ray Parkin. 
 - Parkin, as in... 
 - Lucy Parkin. 
 His sister was the little girl Ben killed 20 years ago. 
 - Ray Parkin's seen a lot of hard times in his 37 years. 
 After his sister's death, his family collapsed around him. 
 His mom committed suicide. 
 A year later, his dad started drinking,  eventually died of liver failure,  and Ray ultimately turned to drugs  and fell into legal troubles. 
 - Bar fights, aggravated assault,  armed robbery. 
 - This guy sounds like he has some serious rage issues. 
 - Yeah, and it's our job to find him  before he takes all that anger out on Grace Harris. 
 Let's make it happen. 
 - Okay, I think we need to talk to the parents,  explain the situation. 
 That may get them to work with us. 
 - Yeah, I think it's a good idea. 
 In the meantime,  what do we know about Ray Parkin's whereabouts? 
 Ian, anything? 
 - No; his phone's been powered off since the kidnapping. 
 - So we can't track him that way. 
 What about the power company? 
 - Supervisor said that he didn't show up for work today,  and the address they have is outdated. 
 - But according to municipal records,  it looks like he has utilities set up in his name  at another address. 
 - Okay, that's something. 
 Check it out.

 Nobody else here.

 I swear, I haven't seen him in two days. 
 - Hey, Scola,  check this out. 
 - Up.

 It's Ray's camera. 
 - And they're all of the Harrises? 
 - He's been stalking them. 
 - We're good. 
 - Research. 
 - Okay, there is no way  that you didn't know about all of this. 
 Where is Grace Harris? 
 - I don't know. 
 Honest. 
 I had nothing to do with taking that kid. 
 - But you do know about it. 
 - Okay. 
 You don't wanna get charges for all of the meth  that is in this place,  you're gonna tell me everything that you know right now. 
 - Ray's always been obsessed with this guy,  Corbin Howard,  the one who killed his sister. 
 He talked about him all the time,  how he'd get back at him if he ever saw him again. 
 All that. 
 But it was just a fantasy. 
 Ray hadn't seen the guy in 15 years  until a few weeks ago. 
 - What happened a few weeks ago? 
 - Uh, Ray was at the courthouse for a parole hearing,  came back saying he saw the guy. 
 Said he's a hotshot lawyer now  and changed his name like nothing ever happened. 
 But he makes a lot of money,  so Ray had this idea  to kidnap his kid, make him pay,  but then things got out of control. 
 He started talking crazy, I--  - Hang on, hang on, slow down. 
 Out of control how? 
 - He started talking crazy and took off with my car. 
 - What kind of car? 
 - A Subaru Impreza, black. 
 Look, I thought it was just a money thing. 
 I swear I didn't know Ray was gonna kill the guy  after he got paid. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 - That's the fourth time he's called. 
 Everything okay? 
 - It's fine. 
 - I don't believe you. 
 - Well, we have more important things  to be worried about right now. 
 - One sec. 
 - [sighs] 
 - Mr. 
 Harris. 
 - What's going on? 
 You find something? 
 - We need to talk to you and your wife. 
 - Do you know where Grace is? 
 - No, we don't, but can we come inside? 
 - I don't think that's a good idea. 
 I thought we made this clear. 
 We want to handle this on our own. 
 - Mr. 
 Harris,  we have evidence that the kidnapper is Ray Parkin. 
 - Lu--Lucy's brother. 
 - Yes. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - That's not possible. 
 How does he even know who I am? 
 - Well, he saw you at the courthouse a few weeks ago,  tracked you down; he's been stalking your family,  and we think he followed you to the cabin last night. 
 - No, no, no, no. 
 I can't believe this. 
 It's been 20 years. 
 - Mr. 
 Harris, we'll do everything we can  to protect your family,  but we need you and your wife to work with us. 
 - No, no. 
 I can handle it on my own. 
 Thank you. 
 - Ben, this guy despises you. 
 - But if I give him the money and tell him what happened,  how sorry--  - Then he will probably kill you and your daughter. 
 That's the truth. 
 Either way, we need to sit down with Rhonda  and explain the risks. 
 - No! 
 No. 
 She can't know about this. 
 - That's not our problem. 
 - You said it earlier. 
 It's not your decision. 
 I'm Grace's father. 
 - And Rhonda is her mother,  and she will get a say in how this goes down. 
 We will not let you compromise your daughter's safety  to protect your secret. 
 - That's not... 
 That's not what I'm doing. 
 - Hmm. 
 - I'm just trying to get my daughter back. 
 That's all. 
 - Either you tell her,  or I do. 
 - Okay, fine. 
 I'll do it. 
 - How could you hide this from me? 
 - Rhonda, it was 20 years ago. 
 You--  - Is that supposed to exonerate you? 
 - No, I just--  I wanted to move forward, to leave it in the past. 
 - It's not in the past, Ben! 
 That girl's brother kidnapped our daughter! 
 - I don't know what to say. 
 I'm sorry. 
 - Sorry? 
 What the hell good is that supposed to do? 
 - Hey. 
 Mrs. 
 Harris, I know this is a lot to process,  but right now we need to focus on getting Grace back. 
 - He's gonna kill her. 
 - No. 
 We're not gonna let that happen. 
 - But you need to let us handle the drop. 
 We're gonna have a team on-site, snipers--  - How could you do this to us? 
 - Rhonda... 
 - I need some air. 
 - This could've waited until after. 
 - No. 
 We had no choice. 
 We had to tell her. 
 - You don't know that.

 Damn it. 
 Rhonda took off.

 ♪  - Rhonda Harris is in the wind. 
 Left the hotel with the ransom money  and the phone they've been using  to communicate with Ray Parkin. 
 He did not relay the location of the ransom drop  by the time she left,  so Ben does not know where she's going. 
 So what about Ray? 
 Where are we on the BOLO with the roommate's car? 
 - Went out a half hour ago. 
 No hits yet. 
 - We cannot let Rhonda go to a meeting  with Ray on her own. 
 We need a location on her now. 
 - Hey, OA got a tracker onto the Harris's car an hour ago.

 Please, don't punish my baby for Ben's mistake. 
 - This isn't how it was supposed to go down. 
 Your husband was supposed to be here, not you. 
 - I thought if you and I could just talk--  - I don't wanna talk to you! 
 - Okay, I understand that you're angry,  and I don't blame you,  but this has nothing to do with my daughter!

 Just shut up!

 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Looks like a hotel room. 
 - Crimes Against Children  maintains a database of hotel rooms.
