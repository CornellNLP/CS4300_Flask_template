 I was told you have news for me. 
 Indeed I do. 
 Well? 
 My spies have travelled all the known lands. 
 They returned with many interesting stories. 
 I have no interest in stories, just the information I paid for. 
 One of these stories tells of a creature with serpents for hair and a look that turns both man and beast to stone. 
 You found her? Where is she? 
 Your beloved Medusa is to be found in a cave on the shores of Cisthene. 
 Where in the name of the gods have you been? 
 The market, to buy some bread. 
 How can you think of food at a time like this? 
 What's going on? 
 It's Medusa. Crios has told me where she can be found. 
 Crios? The man is a liar and a thief! 
 If there is the slightest chance of finding Medusa I have to take it. 
 You have the cure ready? 
 The cure? 
 The cure. For Medusa. 
 (hercules sniffs) 
 Ugh.. I stink. 
 I have to go to the baths. 
 I want to be looking my best when I see Medusa again. 
 I haven't dared dream this day would come. 
 Oh! Praise the gods! 
 Do you have a cure for Medusa? 
 I promised Hercules I would find one, but I haven't had the heart to tell him that I've completely failed. 
 You have to tell Hercules. 
 You can't give him false hope. 
 Hope is all he has. 
 If I take that away... 
 Then you will break his heart. 
 I can't do that to him. 
 There is one other thing we could try. What? 
 Why are you looking at me like that? 
 Because there's something I need you to do and I'm not sure you're going to like it. 
 I did not know when I would see you again. 
 I thought you saw everything. 
 Only that which the gods permit me to see. 
 Is there something you wish to know? 
 It is not knowledge I seek. 
 I need Pandora's box. 
 Why would you ask for such a thing? 
 You've seen the horrors it can unleash. 
 My friend believes it may offer a clue as to how to cure Medusa. 
 I do not doubt that your intentions are good... but the temptation to open the box is too great. 
 I cannot allow it. 
 I was never tempted. 
 You are only just beginning to understand the extent of your gifts. 
 How can I understand them when you won't tell me where they come from? 
 Do they come from my mother? 
 You've not told me anything about her. 
 I've told you all that I know. 
 Then why do all my instincts tell me you're lying? 
 I cannot give you the knowledge that you seek... but I will give you the box, if that's what you desire. 
 So you really think this Daedalus will be able to help us? 
 If anyone can. He is a genius. 
 To him, I am a fool. 
 What does that make the rest of us? 
 To Daedalus, it makes you extremely annoying. 
 (chains rattle) 
 Daedalus? 
 Perhaps he's in the back. 
 What is all this stuff? 
 Daedalus is a man of science, an inventor - this is his life's work. 
 Whatever you do, don't touch anything. 
 Right. 
 Daedalus? 
 Who are you?! What're you doing!? 
 Sorry, I was... 
 This is my friend, Jason. 
 A silly little boy, that's what he is. 
 Can't keep his fingers to himself, can you? 
 Touching and poking. 
 Poke, poke, poke. 
 Poke, poke, poke... Stop poking me. 
 He meant no harm. 
 The box. Show him the box. 
 Ah. This is the box you told me about? 
 It's a source of great evil. 
 It seems such a simple little box... 
 Don't be fooled by its appearance. 
 It must remain unopened. 
 Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to have a quick peek inside. Daedalus! 
 This is what I warned you about. 
 The box cannot be opened. 
 It must be sealed shut before you examine it. 
 Then I have just the thing. 
 There is but one key. 
 I'll take it. 
 I don't like him, not one little bit. 
 The brains of a monkey and the face of a goat. 
 (he bleats like a goat) 
 Perhaps you should leave us to it. 
 Yeah, go on. Shoo, goat boy! 
 With pleasure. 
 (daedalus continues to bleat) 
 So, these markings... 
 You think they mean something? 
 Of course they mean something. 
 Everything means something. 
 The question is what? 
 What do they mean? 
 I don't know. I know. 
 I'm surrounded by fools. 
 Ah... I believe these are words. 
 You say this box belonged to Pandora, the first woman on earth? 
 That is the legend. 
 Then this was forged in the time of the ancient tongue. 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 Perhaps it is another language? 
 No, no, no. 
 It's of the ancient tongue. 
 I'm certain of it. Oli... 
 Oli... Quiet! 
 Come. 
 Here! 
 No, no, no... Ah! 
 What are you doing? 
 Yes! Yes, yes! Come. Here. 
 Again, read it again. 
 "When all seems lost, only hope remains." 
 Yeah. Hope. Man's eternal optimism. 
 Does this mean there is hope for Medusa? 
 You have hope for her. 
 Your stupid fat friend Hercules, he has hope for her. 
 I even have hope for my foolish son Icarus. 
 There's no shortage of hope in this world. 
 Just a shortage of brains. 
 When all seems lost, hope still re... mains. Yes, of course. 
 These markings, I didn't understand them at first, but now it's clear. Is it? 
 Yes, yes. They tell the story of Alcestis... and Admetus. 
 Alcestis and Admetus. 
 It would seem there is a cure for Medusa... 
 How? How can she be cured? 
 You know, as stupid as he is, I pity your friend Hercules, because the price of the cure is his own life. 
 Well? How do I look? 
 You look...cleaner. 
 How do I smell? 
 No. Why? Why do you always insist we smell your armpits? 
 Smell me. 
 (he sniffs) 
 What is that? 
 It's a new scent. Lavender oil. 
 I like it. 
 Now I am a treat both for the eyes and the nostrils. 
 (jason inhales deeply) 
 Well? I'm no closer to finding a cure. 
 You said you knew how to cure her? 
 I said no such thing. 
 You just assumed... 
 You believed the box might hold a clue. 
 I was wrong. The markings on the box are simply decorative. 
 You should return it to the Oracle. 
 Maybe you should sleep on it. 
 You get some of your best ideas when you're sleep. 
 Triangles. That came to you in your sleep. 
 Most men dream about women, you dream about triangles. 
 You should go to bed now. 
 Yes, go, go, go. 
 But the sun hasn't even set yet. 
 There's no time to waste. 
 Sweet dreams. Inspired dreams! 
 Hercules... 
 There must be a way. 
 There is nothing more I can do. 
 Hercules... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know you're frustrated that you haven't found a cure, but it's not your fault. 
 How is he? 
 He hasn't come out of his room. 
 He blames himself for what happened to Medusa. 
 Sometimes I think the guilt is too much for him to bear. 
 That's what I'm worried about. 
 In this state, he's capable of anything. 
 What is it? 
 I'm just worried about him. 
 Me too. 
 Let's see if we can't cheer him up. 
 (knocking at door) 
 Hercules? 
 We brought you wine. 
 Hercules? 
 He's probably in the tavern. 
 His sword's gone. And his bag. 
 He's gone to see Medusa. 
 Surely Crios will know where Hercules has gone. 
 Probably, but he's not a man to be trusted. 
 Pythagoras, my friend. 
 I am not your friend. 
 How you wound me with your insults. 
 Where's Hercules gone? 
 I would imagine he's on his way to the shores of Cisthene to see Medusa. 
 If we find out you're lying about where Medusa is... 
 Much as it pains me, I speak the truth. 
 If we leave now we can catch up with him. 
 It's not catching up with Hercules you should worry about. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, I doubt very much he'll make it past Calydon. 
 My spies tell me there's a band of Scythians in the forest. 
 Did you warn Hercules of the danger? 
 Well, would it have stopped him if I had? 
 He is more lovesick than any man I have ever known. 
 If any harm comes to him... 
 Many men have tried to threaten me, but they too were not quick enough. 
 I think you'll find I'm quicker. 
 But nonetheless stupid. 
 Jason. 
 Oh, no. 
 Sorry. 
 Oh, come on! 
 Any bright ideas? 
 I have often believed that the secret to fighting is to know when you are beaten. 
 CRASH! 
 Ow! 
 
 
 
 I thought we would have found Hercules making camp for the night. 
 If he has a chance of finding Medusa, Hercules isn't going to let something like sleep stop him. 
 So, who are these Scythians Crios spoke of? 
 They're little more than thieves. 
 It's what they do after they rob you that has given them their fearsome reputation. 
 Why, what do they do? 
 They set you free... 
 That doesn't sound so bad. 
 They set you free so that they might hunt and kill you for sport. 
 Right. 
 What is this place? 
 It's a temenos, a sacred grove. 
 By the looks of it, it's for the worship of Artemis, the goddess of the hunt. 
 Scythians? 
 I don't believe so. 
 We should leave this place. 
 (sobbing) 
 What is it? 
 I think she's hurt... 
 Keep watch. 
 Is she dead? 
 No. 
 She isn't a she. 
 Hercules! 
 I wish I could say I was pleased to see you here. 
 How did they catch you? 
 It looked like there was a woman lying injured on the path. 
 Only it wasn't a woman, was it? 
 Look at him. He has a full beard. 
 He was facing away from me. 
 That's what they all say. 
 Well, how did they get you? 
 With stealth and cunning. 
 They're clever, I'll give them that. 
 What did they do? 
 Does it matter? 
 I stumbled into the camp. 
 There was no-one around. 
 There was a big boar roasting on the fire... 
 They caught you eating their lunch? 
 They were not very happy about it. 
 You must think me a fool for going to see Medusa without a cure. 
 I can picture her now - that smile, her little nose. 
 Her eyes - one look and I'd do anything for her... 
 I have to see her again. 
 Even if it's only so she knows I haven't forsaken her. 
 I'm certain she already knows it. 
 (swords are unsheathed) 
 Each of you has the honour of taking part in the greatest sport known to man - a Scythian manhunt. 
 (all roar) 
 And if we decline to participate in this sport? 
 Then you will die where you stand. 
 Good to know. 
 You shall be hunted and slaughtered. 
 But the last of you to survive has earned their freedom. 
 When the horn sounds, the hunt begins. 
 I really think we should start running. 
 Wait...wait. Wait. 
 Wait! Wait! 
 I'm done. I can't run any further. 
 Then we make a stand, together. 
 What with? Twigs against their swords? 
 This is all my fault. 
 You two should go on ahead. 
 Find a place to hide. 
 I'll draw them away from you. 
 We should stay together. 
 We can't argue. Make for the clearing that we found earlier. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 You heard what the man said. Hide! 
 (roaring) 
 (roaring dies away) Scythians - I've always said they were stupid. They'll have to be smarter than that to catch old Hercules. We should make for the clearing. Lead the way. I wasn't calling you stupid. I was talking about your friends. Idiots, the lot of them. (he roars) Hercules! Run! Thank the Gods. Where's Hercules? The last time I saw him, he was wrestling two Scythians. We should make for the clearing and hope that Hercules was able to escape. What is it? That was truly amazing. It doesn't feel amazing. (bird crows) Sssh! (bird crows) Sh! Hercules wins again. (bird crows) If I had a bow, I'd shoot you out of that tree. We made it. I just hope Hercules is all right. When all seems lost, only hope remains. What's that from? It's nothing. It's just a saying. (twig snaps) Oh, no! I think I'm going to have to sit this one out. You never were very good with a sword. I may be small and weak and skinny, but I have killed more men than you have eaten wild boar. I give you one chance to escape with your lives. I will mount your head on a stick. Two chances. Flee, or die. (he roars) (arrows twang) What's happening? I'm not sure. Hercules? If it is, we will never hear the last of it. That's not Hercules. No, no, no... No! Who are you? I am Atalanta. We owe you our lives. Your injury is grave. You are not saved yet. Agrotera makaridze thea tadakesfora fulla. Hoisi tethelos eren... euodes kuparissos. Eren eudes kuparissos. Why did you save us? My Goddess came to me. She told me that I must protect you from harm. Why? It seems that our paths are destined to cross again in the future. What did you say to him? I told him that he must rest. You fear for your other friend? I did not see the Scythians make a kill. There is a chance that he survives. You're a gifted healer. I was abandoned as a child. I grew up here in the forest. I quickly learned how to survive. How could a child survive out here alone? I was never alone. My Goddess, Artemis, was at my side, guiding and protecting me. What you did for Jason - it took more than knowledge of the forest. It was witchcraft. I am a child of the earth. I use the gifts the Goddess gave me. Whatever the source of your gifts, I am grateful for them. Why is it you travel through these parts? It's for my friend Hercules, and the woman he loves, Medusa. Medusa has been cursed to live as a monster. Even if he doesn't have a cure, Hercules will do anything to see her. It is a sad story. But it is not the whole story, is it? There is a way to cure Medusa. If that is so, then why would you not tell your friend? The carvings on the box tell an ancient story - the tale of Alcestis and Admetus. Alcestis was the wife of King Admetus of Thessaly. When Admetus angered the gods he was cursed to die... unless someone he loved volunteered to take his place. But no-one would. Alcestis couldn't bear to see her husband die, so she sacrificed herself for him... Hercules can cure Medusa, but only if he gives his life for hers. You lied to protect him? If I tell Hercules what I know, he will give his life in an instant. As much as I hate to lie to him... I cannot see him die. Wait here. Hello. The name's Hercules... Your friends are at the clearing. The clearing? Is that nearby? I was completely lost. Hercules! I feared you were dead! It takes more than a few Scythians to kill me. What is that in your hair? That? It's bird poo. And what is that on your cheek? Some other kind of poo, I think it might be jackal. You avoided the Scythians by smearing yourself in poo? Could we stop talking about poo? Is he hurt? He was, but he'll be fine, thanks to Atalanta. It's good to see you. Although it is not good to smell you! OK. You can let go now. All right, yeah. I'm sorry I haven't found a cure for Medusa. I hope you're not angry with me. When am I ever angry with you? Very frequently. Ridiculous. When? Name one time when I have ever raised my voice in anger. When you're drunk and when you're hungry - both of which you are most of the time. That's not anger. That's affection. What about the time when I refused to lend you the money for that hog? You became so angry that you set fire to my bed. What sort of a person refuses to lend his friends money? Shame on you. Or when I accidentally punctured a hole in your wine skin? Which I accepted with understanding and good grace. You dangled me headfirst from the balcony. Did I? If I was truly angry, I would have dropped you headfirst from the balcony. You're fortunate I am so even-tempered. Anyway... I'm sorry about Medusa. You have nothing to be sorry for. Whatever you do, even when I'm too pig-headed to see it, I know you've always got my best interests at heart. You're a good friend to me, Pythagoras. Better than you deserve. No... Probably. We should get some sleep. What is it? It's nothing. Go to sleep. Hercules? You're awake. You're alive. And eating? Where's Atalanta? When we woke, she'd gone. She left some pigeons roasting on the fire. Quite a woman. I was just thinking. Maybe I should continue on to the shores of Cisthene alone. You should head back to Atlantis, make sure Jason's wound is properly seen to. My wound's healed. We didn't come all this way to turn back now. We journey to the shores of Cisthene together. Excellent. What is it? Atalanta said our paths would cross in the future. Let us hope that is true. Crios said the stories spoke of Medusa being in a cave. There are dozens of them. Then we must search them all until we find her. I thought you'd be more excited to see her. Hmm? I thought you'd be more excited... to see Medusa. Oh, I am... I was just thinking about everything that's happened since you arrived in Atlantis. All the trouble you've got us into. I'm sorry. I wouldn't have changed it for the world... Well, some of it. I just wanted you to know... What? Over here! They've been turned to stone. Medusa. She's waiting for you. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Of course. Just don't look at her. I won't. I won't forget what you've done for me. Medusa? Medusa? You shouldn't have come. I had to... Even though I cannot look at you, just to hear your voice is enough. It is so good to see you. There isn't a day when I don't think of you. I wish more than anything... to hold you in my arms. We both know that isn't possible. It never will be. You should not lose hope. How can I have hope when even the rats don't dare to come near me? Seeing Medusa as she is, I worry it will only make Hercules sadder. Well, maybe until we find a cure it's better than not seeing her at all. What if I were to tell you I have found a cure? Why didn't you say anything? Because it requires Hercules to sacrifice his life for Medusa's. I couldn't bear to tell him. I can't see him die. He knows... He can't. Why would you think that? When he thanked us for all that we'd done for him. He was saying goodbye. Seeing the life you're condemned to lead - alone, in this cave... This is all my doing. I don't want you to blame yourself. It seems this was my fate. It doesn't have to be... I said I would find a cure, and I have. There's a cure? How? Swear to me you will do exactly as I ask. Promise me. Anything. No! You'll be turned to stone! Trust me. If you love me, you'll do this. I love you with all my heart. Then look at me and you will be cured. What will happen to you? Nothing. Don't worry about me. Just know that I love you. Look at me. No! How is it possible for you to look at me? I don't know. Let me go. Let me look at her. He was going to give his life so that you would be cured. No. Let me do this for her. You think I could live with myself, knowing you had given your life for mine? You have to. It's your only hope. I would do anything for a cure... Anything but this. Knowing we could never be together... I would rather stay cursed. 'Hello!' Has anyone been turned to stone yet? I'm sorry I lied to you. You were right. I don't deserve such a good friend. But I am grateful. Let's go home. I won't stop searching until I find another cure. We will return as soon as we've found one. I promise. I know you will, and that gives me a reason to live. Goodbye, Hercules. (snarling) Do you want to tell us what's going on?
