 I wanna see my baby. 
 There is no baby, dear. 
 Bill Boerg really wants to meet with you. 
 See if you can think about what he might be dreaming. 
 Your man was there. 
 Andy? 
 Go to St. Joseph's Hospital in Queens. 
 And the billing code is for an epidural. 
 The next time you shag the wife of a senior partner, tell her not to sext you on your company cell.

 The answer is, I have no idea. 
 I thought we weren't seeing each other. 
 We're not. I'm not even here.

 So, uh, where do things stand? 
 Uh, the investigation's ongoing. 
 It's been almost a week. 
 You've had to have made some progress. 
 Yeah, four days, and it's ongoing. 
 12 people laid down in a house and killed themselves. 
 I mean, forget they blew up the house across the street. 
 How do 12 people decide just to kill themselves? 
 Well, I have my own opinions, but they're no more informed than anyone else's. 
 Al-Qaeda posts videos on the web. 
 These guys don't even have a known ethos, much less a public profile. 
 Unless you count the word "Topeka," which apparently means "a good place to grow potatoes." 
 "A good place to dig for roots." 
 Yeah, well, we know they're a cult, but they're not jihadist or far right wing. 
 We know they blew up the house, but they've made no calls for violence. 
 They're still dangerous. 
 And that's why the investigation's ongoing. 
 Is there anything in the green sneakers? 
 Generic brand, national chain.

 Logbook from the Belgian Consulate...

 Thank you.

 I saw you, uh, speaking with Woody Hammond? 
 We're giving him some of Jones' accounts. 
 His numbers are better than you think, and he and Jones came over from Deutsche together, so... 
 "continuity of client relations." 
 Whole thing's tragic. 
 Did you call Campbell's? 
 They'll pick up the body as soon as the ME releases it. 
 What about the obit in the "Times"? 
 It'll run Monday. Three-inch column. 
 All right, so how bad off are we? 
 I combed Jones' computer and files. 
 They're immaculate. 
 If there was anything to hurt the firm, he scrubbed it. 
 Well, at least he did us that courtesy. 
 Or maybe there was nothing to find. 
 Jones was regularly predicting market swings like he could see into the minds of half the Street. 
 That's an argument for clairvoyance, not insider trading. 
 Then why was he only clairvoyant in his Topeka accounts? 
 The man killed himself. 
 He didn't do it for no reason. 
 I'd like to search Jones' apartment. 
 If there's nothing here, maybe the evidence is buried in his home files. 
 Is his wife back in the city? 
 Bizzy and I are supposed to go over and pay our respects today. 
 If the government comes knocking, we need to make sure we're inoculated.

 I looked hard. 
 So it's a coding error. 
 Really, some random clerk randomly mis-entered the exact code for an epidural, one of ten thousand possible codes, in your file of all possible files? 
 Then you explain it. 
 You had an epidural. 
 You gave birth to a son. 
 Tess, I believe you. 
 Of all the people in your life, how many actually believe you? 
 [exhales slowly] 
 None of 'em. 
 So have a little faith in those of us who have faith. 
 It's dreams that connect us. You experienced it. 
 What we don't know is how those connections work, but with your help, I was hoping we could figure that out. 
 How do you know so much about me? 
 Truth? 
 I stalked you. 
 Cyberstalked. 
 Five years ago, I tried to hire you to consult on my 3gen phone, and you turned me down, and I still don't know why, but I decided you were interesting, and data mining and algorithms did the rest. 
 If you wanna convince me, you're not helping yourself. 
 Listen to your language. You wanna be convinced. 
 No. 
 Then go. 
 No. 
 Well, there we are.

 You know, is it possible for me to speak with the ambassador? 
 Ann-Marie Bowen asked to see him, and I wanna make sure it wasn't about someone who didn't make it into the book.

 "For I know my redeemer liveth." 
 All right. 
 Ha. 
 "For I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand the latter day upon the Earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God." 
 Well, that's a cheery vision. 
 A body without skin. 
 A man redeemed is a man whose life was worthwhile. 
 So saith the dirty-laundry man. 
 That is why you're here, isn't it? 
 To destroy a dead man's good name while his wife sits in the other room chewing Valium?
