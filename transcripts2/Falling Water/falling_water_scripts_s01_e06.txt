 Previously on "Falling Water"... 
 It's Topeka. It's always Topeka. 
 This is a geological analysis of your Belgian's holdings. They're worthless. A week ago, you offered the Belgian nine figures. Sometimes there are hidden layers of value. What do you dream about? Woody. We have this mad, passionate love affair. Then I wake up, and it's all a dream. Where is she? I'm not allowed to tell. They have me bound. Help me. How? Don't you want to heal your mother? We can help you. She's not gone. She's still in there. But you have to get in the van. He's a tough old bear, and he'll keep you safe. My sister and I had matching bears. Is it yours? I have to talk to my mother. ♪ I wanna look like a bird ♪ 
♪ Careless, weightless, and free ♪ 
♪ I wanna look like a bird ♪ 
♪ Oh, careless, weightless, and free ♪ [soft music] ♪ ♪ What you got there? Nothing. Kind of a big ol' mushroom. It's mine. I found it. Okay. But you know not all mushrooms are good to eat, right? You remember what happened to Babar's father, the king of the elephants? He ate a mushroom that turned him green. Then he died. Yeah, that's right. Then Babar went to the city to find a rich lady to live with and to buy him nice clothes and a car. [chuckles] You've got an interesting take on things. You know that? But let's get rid of that one, because it's no good. Capisce? Capisce. Woody? Do you ever wonder what you want to be when you grow up? [sighs] Sometimes. You know, sometimes I think there's just this path waiting for me. Other times, I think I should just buy a boat and be a fisherman. What about you, Tess? What are you gonna be? I'm gonna be Babar. [dark music] [percussive music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ I wanna look like a bird ♪ 
♪ Scissor wings and split the sky ♪ 
♪ I wanna look like a bird ♪ 
♪ Or like I know what it is to fly ♪ 
♪ Like I don't know about falling ♪ 
♪ Or what it is to cry ♪ 
♪ To look like a bird ♪ Tessie. [laughs] Hey! Charlotte said you might be coming. Mm. You're lucky you beat the weather. It's supposed to pour later. Is Mom in with a group? Just finishing up orientation. First session: Stilling the Mind. You remember the way. Yeah. Good to see you. Welcome back. ♪ ♪ So one last thought before we head back into the evening air. We are not here seeking transmogrification. We are instead seeking reunion with the divided self so that we may know ourselves in full. And from that journey, we will find true wisdom. [unsettled music] ♪ ♪ Order and entropy are funny things. At scale, they're practically interchangeable. So how do we know one from the other? And does it makes a difference? The only cost is confusion, and that's perpetual. "The way that can be spoken of is not the true way." ♪ ♪ [brakes squeak softly] I counted the turns after we left the L.I.E. Two rights, a left, a 3 1/2 minute gap, and two lefts. That must have taken a lot of concentration. If you're hungry... Might not get another chance for a while. [soft, tense music] ♪ ♪ What's she doing here? Hey, I'm talking to you. We hear you. You promised me answers. I promised to help you reach your mother. How? Lie down. No. We're not gonna hurt you. We've gone to a lot of trouble. What hell am I doing here? You don't know anything about my mother. I know your mother. I know your mother. I know your mother. We all do. We see her in our dreams. She told us about you. How you'd wake up early and make breakfast so she could sneak out and make her sculptures. How, after your father left, she told you to go with him. She said, "Go be the hero of your own life." And you said to her, "A hero doesn't leave." How do you know that? I see her in my dreams. All : We all do. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [man speaking over television] We've got thunderstorm warnings issued for both Putnam and Duchess... [doorbell rings] But the storm's biggest target... We need to talk. [sighs] Can't you just let me go crazy in peace? You're not crazy. I think Woody's invading your dreams. [dramatic music] I always thought my dreams were just mine. But then I met a woman who had the ability to enter my dreams, and I realized she wasn't the only one. Okay. I think you dream of Woody because Woody is entering your dreams and manipulating them so that you think you're in love with him. They're such wonderful dreams. I know. I'm sorry. It makes sense. I mean... [laughs]... It doesn't make any sense, but it fits. I need your help. [thunder rumbles] There's someone I love and Woody knows things. What would I have to do? [low music] ♪ ♪ My God, you're a beautiful thing. I love you too. Such a nice surprise to have you here. [soft music] ♪ ♪ [tense music] ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Picking up or dropping off? It's for my mother. ♪ ♪ Can I go out the back? All roads lead to the middle. [distant laughter of children] [little girl singing in French] ♪ ♪ Hello, Maman. [eerie music] [children laughing in the distance] I found this. You gave it to my son. [frantic pounding at door] [dramatic music] You can't have that! No toys in school! ♪ ♪ And now we're late. [classical music playing] I'm sorry, Mom. Shh, listen. Come on. Close those eyes. ♪ ♪ Can you see the dancers? I see them. ♪ ♪ [laughing] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] Close your eyes. Let yourself sink in. Breathe. Are you awake? Yes. Are you awake? Yes. Are you awake? Yes. Open your eyes. Are you ready? Sure. Are you ready to let us help you? What is it you want to say to your mother? I... I don't know. You know. [dramatic music] [kettle whistling] Is that my mother's robe? I was cold. Please take it off. Your mother's got you captured and pinned. And the worst part? She's not even here. She's my mother. And one day, she's gonna wake up. She's gonna wake up. And then what? One day, she wakes up. And then what? ♪ ♪ [door squeaks] Aren't you a sight for sore eyes? Let's get a table in the back. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Question time. You didn't need to involve her. She has a right to know. Baby, don't worry about this. He's crazy. [grunts] Focus. Torture is not an effective tool. But psychological stress is. And since none of this is real, it's all psychological. What is Topeka? [dramatic music] A name. Places need names. Our dreams together, the whole megillah, it needed a name. Topeka? A good place to dig for roots. I know you think you're in control of things, but you're not. You're a chess piece, a pawn, a knight if you're lucky. What does that make you? I'm the buffalo wings at halftime. 
 
 [banging at door] [banging resumes] I know you're there. [banging resumes] I've been sent to talk to you. Open the door. You're messing with things that you don't understand. Whatever. You're not even awake. [soft music] [coughs] [door rattling] ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ It's okay. It's me. It's gonna be okay. Come on. No sleeping at the table. What? Did you think we were done? Sit down. So how was the reunion? Hugs and kisses all around? What did you do to her? Hey, I didn't put her there, and I'm not holding her there. But you needed to know that she's out there, give you something to strive for. That was her. Can I get some drinks? [clears throat] Okay. For most citizens of the world, they're either dreaming... or awake. And these two things stay far apart. But for people with a little know-how, people like me, there's no gap at all. They can walk like an ant on the rim of one glass and onto the other. You, though, have the rare ability to spill your waking into your dreaming so that they overlap and mix together, like the time in the lobby of The Firm. She really was gorgeous in red. Hmm. Martini's yours. How do I find her? Which half of her? [glass shatters] I was wondering when you'd surface. You hypnotize me? There's a thin line between dreaming and waking. We simply ushered you across. What size are you? 9 1/2. These are just sixes and sevens. The line's not hard and fast. It's more like... passing through a waterfall. Really, it's just a two-sided organic system. On the surface, individual blades of grass. Underneath, an intertwined mass of roots we can barely comprehend. What do you want from me? The same thing you want from us. To help you find your way to your mother. Let's go eat. [thunder rumbling in the distance] Lie down. We need to start the session. No. It's for your own mental health. I'm not your patient. Why do you always have to be so difficult? Hmm? [intense music] ♪ ♪ You have unhealthy patterns. ♪ ♪ Stop fighting. I know what's good for you. I love you. ♪ ♪ You're in my dream. You invaded mine first. You called out in your sleep, like you did when you were little. Sorry. You remember what you were dreaming about? No. Well, that's too bad. I'm gonna go out to the car. Got some magnesium. That'll help me be less restless. Be careful. Sounds like that storm's almost here. [percussive music] ♪ ♪ [engine turns over] ♪ ♪ [exhales] Here. You're bleeding. Am I awake? Yes. Prove it. I can't. But you used to know the difference. Here, I'll take that. Why am I here? [chuckles] That's a rather pedestrian question. I want to help you reunite with your girl. Why? Because she's a person being held against her will in a basement to the point of madness, because the people holding her are the ones with the green sneakers. They want to unleash the same kind of anarchy on humanity that your dreams have unleashed on you. How? The boy. He's a very special boy. Huge untapped power. Nine figures' worth? Oh, more. Here. The first step to finding your girl. If you're gonna sell me the fish, tell me the price. I thought you loved her. Give me the envelope. You still think you can do this on your own. Wars have two sides. Those who don't pick one get smashed in the middle. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Now, now. You don't have to be alone. But you're not welcome here. [ominous music intensifies] ♪ ♪ I don't get any? Yours is back there. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ This isn't real. This is a dream. Say something. She's waiting. What is it I'm supposed to say? What do you want to say? You're the one with the power. You brought her to the forest. You made her cry out. I did it? Start small, something simple. ♪ ♪ Are you gonna eat those fries? Keep going. They look delicious, no? I just might help myself to the burger next unless you're gonna eat it. [scoffs] Right, okay. Mine, then. You don't know what you're missing. You keep this up, I'm gonna eat the whole thing. [sighs] You just... you just gonna sit there and say nothing? Like always? This is bullshit. Are you sure you want to leave that much unsaid? You can't help me. You can't help my mother. You're going in circles. [chuckles] You'll be back. [door closes] [music playing softly] ♪ ♪ You're leaking. Thank you. [sighs] Can't sleep? Don't want to. Yeah, I tried that once. Made it six days. And then what? They arrested me. Wandering in the middle of Sixth Avenue. I didn't think I was in Sixth Avenue. I thought I was in the beach, dancing to Dusty Springfield. Sounds nice. It was cold and rocky. There was this craggy old tree. It all seemed so real. Maybe it was. How the hell did you make it six days? You really should sleep. So should you. When you find that cold, rocky beach, look behind the tree. There's a bottle of Margaux.

Will I still see you for brunch on the 15th? Sure. It never did rain, did it? No. Anyway, I love you, darling, and I always will. [line clicks] [woman speaking over intercom] I thought maybe you snuck out for a bite. Here we are, same as always. There's no one else here. [chuckles] Not even you. [soft music] ♪ ♪ I need you to meet me halfway. ♪ ♪ Wake up. I'm here. I'm waiting. Come on. Do it now, Ma. Wake up! [sniffles] I hate her. When I was eight years old, I ate a poison mushroom and went into a coma for three days. When I woke up, the funky old priest at my bedside asked me if I saw God. I told him no, but I did hear Dusty Springfield. He smiled at me and said, "Same thing."
