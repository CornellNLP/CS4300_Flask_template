 Previously on "Falling Water"... 
 Yeah, I saw your patient out in the woods with a bunch of those green-sneaker people. 
 Alice is not some gentle, little girl. 
 Our Belgian client has concerns. 
 But he's also unloading his nine-figure holdings. 
 Step out of the way. 
 Who is he? 
 He was my silent partner. 
 I thought we weren't seeing each other? 
 We're not. 
 I'm not even here. 
 What are they? 
 Forget-me-nots. 
 Help me, and I will help you find your son. 
 What now? 
 Now you lie down and go to sleep. 
 Your man was there, Andy. 
 Andy? 
 Don't tell Bill. 
 [Intense ominous music] 
 [Police siren wailing] 
 A half-hearted poem: 
 "I once met a woman who wasn't there. 
 "She was long and tall and slim and fair. 
 "I love this woman with all my heart. 
 "And when she vanished, it tore me apart." [Knock at door] "I once met a woman who wasn't there." [Knocking continues] "I followed her down to the pit of despair. She was not evil, she was kind. "It was not her, but me..." [Knocking continues] "Who was blind." Men. [Chuckles] ♪ ♪ How are you, Andy? [Faint indistinct arguing] You look in a hurry. Are you in a hurry? [Lock clicks] Always. That's why you never get anywhere. Things take time. Patience, practice. I hear you're working with Bill Boerg. Not anymore. You don't have to worry. Andy, I've worried about you every minute since you've scuttled off into the dark three years ago. Now I need you. You're family, and family is forever. Why? The boy's been taken. [Intense dramatic music] [Dark music] ♪ ♪ [Answering machine beeps] Hey, Tess, it's B. He doesn't want you to know, but... Javier's in the hospital. It's not good. [Machine beeping steadily] [Camera snaps] [Camera snaps] [Camera snaps] [Exhales] Pájaro. How are you, amor? How do I look? Handsome. Thank goodness love is blind. [Laughs] How about you? How are your wings? Come on, let me see, turn around. Javi... Turn. [Wind whooshing faintly] Yes. [Light chuckle] Must have taken a lot to get you off the boat. If I knew all they were gonna tell me is that I'm dying, I would have jumped into the Aegean while I still could. I'm glad you didn't. So, how much for your secrets? A drachma. I will give you ten. You already know too many. I always knew I couldn't keep you. [Sighs] What? What is it? Been having powerful dreams again. Again? When did you stop? Javi, I'm serious... So am I. You talk like your dreams are a curse. How I wish I could dream like you. It is a privilege to dream. None of us can do it forever. [Knock at door] Excuse me, Mr. Mendoza, we need to... We just need a moment. They have come to make it possible for me to piss. [Both chuckle] If you don't mind, I don't want the last memory you have of my pen1s attached to a catheter. [Laughs] Okay. [Ominous industrial tone] [Office phones ringing] I wanted to apologize for the other night. Alice... her parents confirmed what you told me, that she's been sneaking out. I like this girl. She's... reachable, but I'm not reaching her. And I thought if you told me more about your experience in the woods, it might give me some insight. Let me talk to her. She'll barely talk to me. She won't talk to me, not about her friends in the green sneakers. Well, then she'll probably stonewall me too. So where's the risk? I'll ask. [Old typewriter keys clacking] [Typewriter clacking continues] [Ominous music] ♪ ♪ What are you writing? What do you care? You don't even want to be here. ♪ ♪ [Typewriter clacks, bell dings] [Slow-motion footsteps reverberate] ♪ ♪ [Slow-motion footsteps] [Indistinct whispering voices] [Eerie fading screams] ♪ ♪ [Slow-motion footsteps reverberate] ♪ ♪ Where are you going? I have a date. No, you don't. It's what you want me to do. Validate the little pocket of paranoia in your head. Why are you doing this? I don't want to do this. Then be here. Stay here. Accept this as the time we have. [Boot zips up] [Indistinct whispering voices] See, even when you're here, you're not here. Because this is a dream. I need more than just dreams. Why? Tell me about the pub. That's not fair. Blonde wood. Brass fixtures. A jackalope above the bar. You were wearing a green skirt. You were on your second pint. You asked me my favorite book. [Soft laugh] I wrote my number on your business card. Stop it. I swore I wasn't going to kiss you. You can't keep doing this. I swore I wasn't going to kiss you. [Gentle ethereal music] [Echoing] I swore I wasn't going to kiss you. ♪ ♪ Then you did. ♪ ♪ [Sirens wailing faintly] You hungry? I always eat them two at a time in a three-to-two ratio. Perfect balance. The only problem is the extra cookie. Sure you don't want? Those'll kill you. Oh, almost everything in this life will. I almost broke my neck chasing you through those woods. I'm sorry if I disturbed the ritual. I just... I really wanted to understand. Can you help me understand? I'm the one who found them. They were lying in a circle. Their heads together. Such an odd way to die. Not like eating an ice cream sundae, somebody sneaking up behind you, pulling a bag over your head. ♪ ♪ That's a whole different kind of death. ♪ ♪ Your friends in the house, that was something sacred. Cops I work with think they were deluded, but I know they're wrong. Problem is I can't explain why they're wrong. Who cares? The police don't matter. Who does? Ann-Marie Bowen? The other Ann-Marie Bowen? Does Trey Walker matter? He was one of the dead bodies, an older boy. He lived across the street from you. I'm not talking about Trey. Your parents told me you used to have dreams about him. That's a lie. Said you wrote about it in your diary. I was a stupid little girl. ♪ ♪ Trey... Can't speak for himself anymore. He needs you. He needs you to explain why what he did was so important. It was. Worth his life? He wasn't supposed to die. What was supposed to happen? Protection. They were betrayed. By who? ♪ ♪ Fat men who eat too much ice cream. ♪ ♪ What were they protecting? I'm not talking about that. Was it Topeka? Shut your mouth. Tell me about Topeka. Why was it backwards on the wall? I said shut up! Alice, stop. You're a blind sheep. Your face is buried in the mud. Blind sheep get slaughtered. [Imitates sheep bleating] [Ambient music] ♪ ♪ Today's exercise: You're the lead. Your job's to collect the other dreamers and bring them back to the chairs one-by-one. We're giving you a promotion. Thanks. Dreamers, look this way. Look at the others. Take in their faces. Then go find them. Lie down, please. ♪ ♪ [Ominous ethereal music] ♪ ♪ Can you hear the music? I'm not allowed to change the channel. ♪ ♪ [TV static] It's recording. You're a very smart girl. ♪ ♪ [Eerie tone] Come on.

Find him. [Infant crying] [Ominous whoosh] There you are. Welcome back. Something went wrong. Faceless man? The man in that bed... He's fine. We were attacked. Tess. He's fine, I promise. It's you we're worried about. You were out for hours. He's really fine? When you die in your dreams, you don't actually die. That's a myth. That's how the whole Andy stroke rumor got started. Tess, I know this is difficult, but we're doing groundbreaking work. This gets to the heart of who we are. I'm just glad you're okay. ♪ ♪ [Ominous music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 [Slow-motion footfall reverberates] [Telephone rings] [Over phone] Can you see me? Yes. [Gulps] Can you see me now? Just your legs. That's enough. [Slow-motion whoosh] [Click, electric buzzing] [Electric buzzing] [Muffled buzzing] [Moans] [Moaning] Can you feel it? [Glass vibrating] [Moaning intensifies] Yes. Open your eyes. Look at me.

♪ heads will roll on the floor ♪ Come out, come out, wherever you are. Forget-me-not? How much? [Sighs] I knew I knew that voice. Get out of my life. Thought you wanted to get tight. Not anymore. Can't even be friends? Now that I've had my hand down your pants? You know, I had a good thing before you had Bill kick me out of the study. I was... I was embedded. Yeah, like a tick on a dog. Who's the kid in the flyer? Why was that flyer so special that you lost your mind? Get out of my way! God, you are selfish. [Chuckles] You're like... You're like Goldilocks, when you stumble in the bears' house, you eat all their food... [Metal pounds] You break their chairs, you sleep in their beds. And then you scream when they catch you, like you're the victim. But here's the thing. About Goldilocks? In the end? The bears ate her. And nobody noticed. Because nobody cared. She was a self-centered bitch, alone in the world. And nobody missed her when she was gone. [Ominous whoosh] I don't have to do a damn thing to you. World's full of monsters. One of 'em will swallow you up soon enough. On your way, Goldilocks. On your way! ♪ You're all chrome ♪

[Scoffs] [Eerie whoosh] [Indistinct whispering voices] [Eerie whoosh] [Indistinct whispering voices] [Eerie whoosh] [Intense industrial tone] [Ominous tone] [Slow-motion footfall reverberates] [Echoing] Hello, darling. Just passing by? Who's back there? I'm not the nosy type. [Thud echoing] [Tennis ball echoing] [Eerie tone] You're not supposed to be here. The restaurant's closed. Who's the boy? This isn't for you. You have to go. What are you trying to hide? Leave! [Intense music] ♪ ♪ [Exhales] [Cell phone rings] This is Burton. [Ominous music] Where's the fire? Our paranoid Belgian client. Fallout from Montreal. Seven days ago this was an easy closing on a nine-figure deal. Now it's a tire fire. The Belgian doesn't want to sell to white sand anymore. He wants new buyers, multiple buyers, and he wants to be in active negotiations this week or he'll take his business across the street. Talk him out of it. Walk him back. Cow's already out of the barn. It's my fault. No, you don't get to take a bullet. You were security and you were the senior hand on deck. You should've been watching him. We'll find another buyer. In a week? I had to guarantee the Belgian a goddamn floor price. Sounds like we don't have a choice. Well, with time, we could use this to our advantage, play buyers off of each other. We still can. We just have to get them all in one place, put a clock on them. We do it out of our office. Treat it like an auction. It's already Monday in the far east. I could get on the horn and start making phone calls. We'll need travel, security, office space for everyone we can lure into town. Whatever his prospects need, you get, even if it's a half dozen corn-fed virgins. As we hone in on a buyer, I'll need help vetting their cash reserves. Shouldn't be hard. It'll be goddamn arcane, but it's find a buyer or cancel Christmas. ♪ ♪ [Ambient music] Can I help you? Can I have a dozen biscotti? Sure. Double cap up. Long way to come for biscotti. There's a... A farmers' market that I like not far from here. It has this lady who sells pupusas. Yeah, Mrs. Flores. She's good. [Soft chuckle] Here I thought she was my little secret. You want a secret? Try Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen, the Vietnamese couple two stalls down. Their mushrooms will change your life. Life-changing mushrooms? No, not quite as life changing as the pinoles here. You've had the pinoles? Just the biscotti. Hey, Maria? Can I get a pinole? Here you go. Thank you. Here. Now, if that's not the best pinole in the city, I'll buy you a dozen pupusas. So? I guess I'll have to try the mushrooms. Well, can I introduce you to the Nguyens? That'd be nice. [Clears throat] [Ominous music] ♪ ♪ [Indistinct announcements over P.A.] You can't go. Why not? Because if I got eaten by bears, you'd actually care. [Soft laugh] Tess, don't do that. Stay. I wish I could. I wish I could have one last dance. I can do that. [Wheezing breath] I can.

Okay. Yeah. Thank you. We have our first swimmer in the pool. Congratulations. Mr. Song from Malaysia. His top aide was already in Vancouver so it was just a hop, a skip, and a jump. I was thinking we should get some food. [Exhales] Yeah, I could eat. How about Marcello's? [Ominous music] Marcello's? Do they deliver? If you ask nicely. ♪ ♪ Hm, yeah, sure, why not? Only shame is we can't put it on Hull's credit card. [Soft chuckle] You could call Mrs. Hull, ask for the number. Yeah, I don't want to drag her into this. She's a nice lady, even if she is a bit nuts. Maybe it's the company she keeps. ♪ ♪ Well, that's true for all of us. There are sirens everywhere, just waiting to drag us into the well. Don't forget: Mr. Song's people, 6:00 AM at the hotel. Hey. Yeah. You... you have Japan? Okay, great. Yeah, no, I'll hold. ♪ ♪ I didn't expect to spend my day like this. Is it over?

I know who I am and that's not changing. Things happen to you, you become particular. And you have to be honest about it. Right, I get it. Taka. Come inside. Stand here.
