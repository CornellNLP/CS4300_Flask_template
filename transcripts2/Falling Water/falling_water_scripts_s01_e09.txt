 Previously on "Falling Water"... 
 Imagine you're the man in the picture... flying. 
 You have the rare ability to spill your waking into your dreaming. 
 I think the Firm's getting played. If it was fraud, we never would have made the floor price. Who's the buyer? Isla and Mr. Song. You bought that boy, didn't you? Of course not. That would be immoral. Find The Boy and save us both. Who is he? The key to everything. You said your mother never talks to you. What if you could hear her voice? both : It was dreams or death. How're you doing this? She's not. You are. Ever since we saw him at that window, I feel so close. There's an old friend of mine who works at the Firm. He saw me with you this morning, and he passed me a note. Says I shouldn't trust you. He wants me to meet with him. [edgy music] ancient voice : Reaching through the waterfall is not a task for the timid. The things you touch are as likely to harm as to heal. Lies that seem like truths, truth that seems like a lie. It's easy for the ignorant to be brave. On the other hand, to straddle that line beneath the falling water, knowing you have no way of knowing whether you're the hero or the villain... that takes a special kind of courage. Rare. In the end, none of us write our own epitaph. [chuckles] Except maybe Bob Dylan. [edgy music] [dark music] ♪ ♪ So why is Bill not my friend? [sighs] Look, I wanna protect you, okay? I... I care about you. Everyone always says they care about me right before they start to lie. What are you not telling me? I did an under-the-table gig for Bill. Part of the same one that you're working on. Exploring dreams. Controlling access. Have you had a dream recently where you were trapped in a room and you couldn't get out? There was a spinning device on the table. That's Bill's tech. With it he can make the walls of our dreams absolute or dissolve them entirely. His plan is to provide a tiered user experience. Son of a bitch wants to take the most free and human experience there is and own it outright. Bill's a monster. ♪ ♪ [camera humming] Eat your lunch, dear. It's perfect. May I film your handsome face? Mom. [laughs] All right. [sighs] [subtle musical sting] You can wave. They're our friends. They scare me. [scoffs] They admire you. They want us to be together and not just in dreams. How? The boy in the flyer. He can bring me back. You just have to find him and then tell them where he is. What will they do to him? Adul, they love him. Yeah, but they took him away from his mother. And they realize their mistake. They want her to come with him this time. What if she says no? You'll convince her. You know. Mothers and sons belong together. Now, eat your sandwich. [edgy music] ♪ ♪ I need you to promise me. You'll find The Boy. I promise. You've been so patient. And I've missed you so much. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [distant traffic sounds] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [background chatter] [mellow pop music in background] ♪ ♪ You look suspiciously well. I ordered you a Negroni. My dime. Well, I certainly wasn't gonna pay for it. Would it help if I apologized? Only if you're sorry. For quitting? No. For not talking to you first. I'll think about it. How's the family? Good God, even I don't want to talk about them. What do you really want? I have a new client. Working freelance. My client wants to meet Mr. Song. I told him the Firm would be willing to make an introduction for a fee. And why does he want to meet Mr. Song? A large fee. We'll have to smooth over your frustrated curiosity. What's your cut? Less than you think. It's not H. Robert? No. You hurt my feelings. Not that I have... feelings. No. Never feelings. Call me tomorrow. How was your picnic? Doors have locks for a reason. Is it all that different from me waiting in the hall? Yes. Your mother says you're ready to help us. I'm ready to help my mother. If the distinction makes a difference... Yeah. It's like you waiting in the hall. Time is short on this. [book slaps softly down] Where will you take The Boy? To a safe place. Where he'll want for nothing. And Tess? She'll be with him. If she chooses. I won't let you hurt him. Lie down. I mean it. I'd die before hurting that boy. [edgy music] ♪ ♪ Close your eyes. Hear my voice. Breathe... slowly. I'll meet you on the other side... in Topeka. [intense musical buildup] This way. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [metal clanging, hinges creaking] ♪ ♪ [hinges squealing] [clang] [dark, suspenseful music] How'd you build this? Your mother built it for us. The room is designed to see into Tess's dreams. When she sleeps, you'll see her through the peephole. She and The Boy have a close bond, so with luck, she'll lead you to him. Why can't your people follow her to The Boy? They've been trying, but our initial approach was overly confrontational. So now we need a face she trusts. When you find The Boy, push the button. We'll hear it. We'll come. We're all very grateful. [edgy music] ♪ ♪ [clang] ♪ ♪ [background noise] [subtle musical sting] [running footsteps] [eerie music] ♪ ♪ What kind of stupid games are you playing at? Telling the Firm you wanna meet Mr. Song? I have a client who's interested in rare-earth metals. No, you don't. This is about The Boy. Where is he? Why? Her? She told me to find him. I should feed you to Mr. Song's tigers. If that's what it takes. To feel love that deeply... Now, that's a dream I'd like to share. Are you willing to share? Are you going to be greedy with your love? [dramatic chords] ♪ ♪ What are you doing? Defining my price. You want The Boy. I want your dreams. I have no dreams of my own, so... I'm covetous. ♪ ♪ I believe you sit there. Luster. [sounds echoing] [pipe bubbling] Now you. It's not a dream if you're not dreaming. [dark, edgy music] ♪ ♪ [click] [Burton inhales, pipe bubbling] [intense music] ♪ ♪ [softly] Don't fight it. Look at me. Tell me what you say to me. I say you almost didn't come. Now what do I say? You say you couldn't catch a cab. Say it. [breathing hard] You almost didn't come. And then? Tell me you're staying at the Pierre. Always the Pierre. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ [intense musical buildup] Tell me. What do we do now? We fight. Because we love each other. Very much. And then? You asked me about the pub. [small laugh] Blond wood, brass fixtures. You were wearing a green skirt. You were on your second pint. You asked me my favorite book. I wrote my number on your business card. [exhales] Take me to Mr. Song. I swore I wasn't going to kiss you. Please. You have to make me feel it. [breathing hard] I have to find The Boy. The Boy's not with Mr. Song. He never was. I don't understand. Mr. Song was a front for another buyer. Then who has The Boy? I swore I wasn't going to kiss you. [tense music] [whispers] Then you did. [intense musical buildup] ♪ ♪ 
 
 [phone rings] [ringing] [ringing] The name of the buyer is Bill Boerg. [dramatic musical sting] [somber music] ♪ ♪ You're not supposed to be here now. I'm looking for Bill. You're going to upset the purity of the data. Wouldn't want to upset the data. Mr. Boerg's on his way to the airport. Well, when he checks in, tell him I know who has my son. Is that so? I'm pretty damn sure I am. Enjoy your data. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [dripping sound] [dripping] [eerie music] [distant clanking] ♪ ♪ [tinny old-fashioned music playing] ♪ ♪ [tinny music grows louder] [clanking continues] ♪ ♪ [rapid clicking] [hammering] [tinny music continues] ♪ ♪ [clanking, power-up thrum] [sounds become muffled] [distant]  ♪ ♪ [power-down thrum] [tinny music continues normally] ♪ ♪ [edgy music] ♪ ♪ [clank, squeak] [edgy music continues] ♪ ♪ [door clangs shut] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [clattering] [static thrumming] [static thrumming continues] [thrumming gets closer] [baby's cry echoes] [echoing] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [baby's cry echoing] ♪ ♪ [baby crying insistently] [loud cry] [clank] [cries stop] No! [echoing] No! [echoing] Where are you? Where are you?! [eerie, dark music] ♪ ♪ [ominous musical buildup] She was calling out to him. That means The Boy was close. She saw me standing there. And? Stop putting all that away. Just trying to be helpful. Yeah. Maybe I like the mess. I wasn't born into this either. I had to find my way. Letting some charlatan dunk you in the river, that's easy. Commitment is hard. I don't wanna lie to her. So, tell her as much of the truth as you can. Yeah, and the rest is lying. You don't have to do anything. I can let you off the hook. But then you will be on your own. Does she still trust you? Don't you think you should find out? [exhales] So... Dazzle me. I have dreams that tell me things. A-and not like it sounds. It was always just hunches. But lately, it's changed like... like my dreams are almost part of my waking life. Try a therapist. Yeah, I need to talk to your sister. I need you to call her. Right. So is there any part of this that has to do with me, or is it just people around me? Your sister's not crazy. I see her in my dreams. I've met her son. [whispers] Why? Why are you doing this? I've seen you too. The night before I ran into you at the market, you were in a hotel room. I was watching you through the glass. You asked if I could see you. [whispers] I saw you. I think you were in my dream and I was in yours. I think you knew we'd work because we'd already found each other... in our dreams. [somber music] ♪ ♪ Is it really that painful? She'll never know. It's not like you were unfaithful. In a literal, biblical sense. We're all exploiting each other. Or am I wrong, and you're the one honest man in the world? Please... stop talking. What is he doing here? He's here to see you. You said Mr. Song had new business. I lied. How much did Bill Boerg pay you to scuttle the deal with White Sand? [tense music] I don't think I need to be here any longer. ♪ ♪ H. Robert and White Sand wanted The Boy. For you to go against H. Robert, Bill Boerg must have offered quite a lot. I don't care which side you're on... or why you did it. Look... I was only the delivery man. I brought The Boy from here to there. After that, it was out of my hands. Take me to The Boy... or I'll tell H. Robert you double-crossed him. Why did you even let him in? Because I'm a masochist. He says you have a son. You don't believe that. He said other things too. He asked me to call you. What kind of things? Nothing that I can bring myself to believe, but... enough to call. [whispers] Just go talk to him. I saw you last night. And I saw you. So I guess... we both remember our dreams. Were you following me? I was looking for your son. [somber music] My mother... has been catatonic for seven years. She doesn't speak. But one night, in a dream, she told me... your boy has the power to wake her up. She said he's a very special boy. Why did you need to talk to Bill Boerg that day? He was linked to a case. A man who'd been part of some experiment turned up dead. And in his luggage, I found a stack of those blue flyers. Was his name Andy? You knew him? I was part of the same experiment. How did he die? Fell off a roof. I think... we were very close to finding your son. I think if we can find each other again, I can get us to that courtyard. What do we tell my sister? The truth. Sabine. Your boyfriend and I need to sleep together. [somber music] ♪ ♪ I can't believe you let that succubus twist you around. You know if you're not careful, you lose your soul to people like her. As opposed to you, who has nothing but kindness in his heart? So I like to have a good time. Life's a swamp. All these grand people and their plans... Bill Boerg, H. Robert. You know, one day all of their houses will burn to the ground. With you lighting the match. Do I look suicidal? What did you say to Jones the night he killed himself? I saw you. You called him into the conference room. Nothing much. This and that. This and that made him go home and put a gun in his mouth? You really wanna know? Because if you really wanna know... Peas-and-carrots, peas-and-carrots, peas-and-carrots, peas-and-carrots. Rutabaga-rutabaga-rutabaga. [chuckles] [inhales, exhales] [soft music] ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [knocks echo] Taka? Taka, you there? [clank, squeak] You found me quick. I've had some practice. Come on, this way. [tense music] ♪ ♪ You know if you're any kind of smart, you'd bail on this nonsense, catch a flight to Cancun. So which apartment is it? You wanna guess? I don't have to guess. I have you. Where is he? This is where I brought him. Look, there is more at stake here than just you, okay? There are actual innocent people involved. The Boy has a mother. He's not here. They must have moved him. Where would they move him? Cancun? [light suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Topeka? ♪ ♪ Like an ant... on the rim of a glass. You know, when you finally understand what the hell you're doing, you are gonna terrify people. Get in the icebox. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic musical sting] [dark music] I can't hear him. Had you heard him here before? Yeah, but then it dropped out. Why can't I hear him? [dark music] ♪ ♪ I think I found something. He's on 8. What's that? [clatter, clank] [static thrumming] Uhh! Run! Aah! [static thrumming] [sounds muffled] [muffled] Uhh! [muffled grunting] [power-down thrum] Mom! [mysterious music] ♪ ♪ Put The Boy down. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [Tess continues pounding on door] You ready to fly? Let's fly. [somber music] ♪ ♪ ancient voice: The true hero can't know that they did right. Only that they did. So beware those convinced of their own rectitude. It's only with the distance of generations that we can know the truly righteous. And, really... who's got time for that bullshit?
