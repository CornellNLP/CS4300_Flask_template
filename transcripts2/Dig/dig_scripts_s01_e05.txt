 Previously on  Dig... 
 My boy! Welcome to Croatia. 
 This is my daughter Elena. She will not bite. 
 What is this place? 
 Place where people would purify themselves, wash away their sins, heal. 
 You said you wanted to get away from anything that reminded you of your daughter. 
 [bang] 
 These guys are planning on rebuilding the temple. 
 That's insane. 
 man : For this prophecy to come true, they need... 
 A red heifer. 
 A high priest. 
 Guilty. 
 Tell me where Debbie is. I came to take her home. 
 Hello, I'm in here! 
 Peter : Rabbi Lev is collecting the stones, so where might he be looking? 
 [gunshots] 
 [distant chanting] 
 Peter : I'm just saying I think reckless is too strong a word. 
 You shot your weapon into one of Israel's most sacred sites... what would you call it? 
 My job. 
 I'm gonna get an earful from the ambassador by the end of the day. 
 You know, why don't you tell Ridell she's welcome to skip the next cocktail party and come and join the manhunt, see if she knows better. 
 This guy keeps slipping out of your hands, almost as if you don't want to catch him. 
 What do you want me to tell her? 
 Tell her... Yussef Khalid has help. 
 He's not acting alone. 
 He's part of a... a bigger agenda. 
 Meaning you're back to square one. 
 No, that's not true. 
 It's a setback, yes... 
 That theory's just a theory. 
 Patience is wearing thin. 
 You gotta come up with something. 
 People are getting impatient. I need something fast. 
 You know... 
 Door will lock behind you on your way out. 
 There's a protest outside the consulate, ma'am. 
 Traffic... is a nightmare. 
 As opposed to the usual dream it is in this city? 
 Something funny... Nadav? 
 No, ma'am. 
 Uh-huh. 
 So you noticed Agent Connelly in my house? 
 Yes, ma'am. Will he need a ride? 
 No. 
 I just gave him one. 
 [laughs] 
 [engine turns] 
 [crowd chanting] 
 No. Hold off on anything with the ambassador until I've had a chance to prepare for the meeting. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, bye. 
 The consulate is blocked for security, ma'am, including the garage. 
 Just turn here. 
 I'll get out and walk if I have to. 
 Ma'am, I don't think that's such a good idea. 
 [chanting continues] 
 [car horns honk] 
 Can you back up? 
 Ma'am, I can't. 
 [crowd shouting] 
 Get us out of here! 
 [thud] 
 [Nadav yelling in Hebrew] 
 Lynn : Go to hell! 
 Get away from the car! 
 No... Nadav! 
 No, don't take him... 
 Don't take him... 
 Nadav! 
 Nadav! 
 [mysterious music] 
 ♪ 
 Hey, man. 
 Where did you get that? 
 My daughter. 
 Why? 
 I was like, "Who is this dude walking in here with Emma's journal?" 
 Peter. 
 Rami. 
 I'm so sorry for your loss. 
 Our loss. 
 She was a regular here, then? 
 Every day. 
 Skim milk latte and a cranberry scone. 
 [chuckles] 
 She used to make notes in that thing all the time. 
 Yeah. 
 We drifted apart the last few years. 
 [bells ringing] 
 It's, uh... you said "our loss." 
 Who do you mean? 
 Oh, just a group of friends. 
 She sometimes liked to hang out with us. 
 Well, any chance I could meet some of the others? 
 I don't know, every little... bit helps. 
 Sure. 
 My shift ends here in 20 minutes. 
 Wanna walk with me? 
 Great. Thanks. 
 [rooster crows] 
 [chickens clucking] 
 [phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 I will be late. 
 Thanks to your shitty cars and your shitty roads and your lame excuse for a country. 
 [small laugh] You Israelis... so entitled. 
 Just have the boy and the package ready. 
 I'll probably make it in two hours. 
 [trance music blasting] 
 Just a little warning. 
 My friends like to party. 
 Might not be your kind of thing. 
 I'm a big boy. 
 [native word] Everybody, come meet Emma's father. 
 Peter. 
 She was like an angel. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 So... how well did you know Emma? 
 Starlet : Not too well. 
 She went through the break-up soon after we met her and wasn't around much after it. 
 With, uh... break up with her boyfriend? 
 She mentioned something casual, but... who was he? 
 We never met him. She didn't bring him around. 
 Right. 
 No pressure. 
 Just offering. 
 [lighter snaps] 
 One for Emma. 
 [roughly] It's been a while. 
 I know you said you weren't hungry, but I made a smoothie for you anyway just in case. 
 The brush is optional, but Mr. Billingham says the dress isn't. 
 Did you think about what we talked about yesterday? 
 You can help me... and yourself in the process. 
 I'm sorry, Debbie. 
 Please. 
 Wait. 
 Before I got here, I... 
 I did things... things I had to to survive. 
 Things to my body. [whimpering] 
 To my soul. 
 Things I regret. 
 But the thing is... you know, all those years, I had to think on my own. 
 I know now that was God teaching me... [tray clatters] because I... I know... that what they're doing here isn't just wrong, see, it's evil. 
 Listen to your heart, Sandra. 
 [whispering] You can think for yourself too. 
 I will pray for you. 
 No... no. 
 Oh... 
 Ah! 
 [door opens] 
 Debbie : Ohh... 
 I knew that was you yesterday. 
 [whimpers] 
 Still gotta find a way out of this crazy place. 
 Bye, Sandra. 
 [door opens, closes] 
 What happened? 
 man : Team one evacuating out main entrance. 
 [alarm ringing] 
 [whispers] Aw, sh1t. 
 So much for going out the way I came in. 
 [alarm continues blaring] 
 Someone is here to see you. 
 Ambassador, hello. 
 Lynn, you poor thing. 
 You must be traumatized. 
 Fortunately, it's all something of a blur in hindsight. 
 Looks like we can't catch a break lately, can we? 
 I'd only received the preliminary report of the incident at Megiddo when all of this went haywire this morning. 
 This Yussef Khalid is running us ragged. 
 They say he took some kind of stone from one of the mosaics? 
 Apparently so, yeah. 
 Any idea what that's about? 
 No. But I can assure you that we will find him. 
 Yeah, well, we have bigger fish to fry. 
 Secretary Reynolds is making a visit with both sides in the room to help secure the peace accord. 
 We're going to have to shift all our focus to security now. 
 [beeping] 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Incoming. 
 Have you... have you heard anything about Nadav? 
 He's still in surgery. 
 The head trauma was substantial. 
 [sirens whooping] 
 He has the stone. 
 I don't know, but wherever he is, if he doesn't make contact soon, it's on you. 
 [chanting in background] 
 [Yussef sobbing] 
 [breathing hard] 
 [alarm ringing] 
 [running footsteps] 
 Let's go. 
 We may have to wait until things die down to make a run for the parking lot. 
 Make 'em think we got away. 
 [mellow music plays] 
 ♪ 
 You were asking about her boyfriend? 
 Yeah. 
 Talk with Julie. 
 Supposedly, the guy got rough with Emma a week before they broke up. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Well, who's Julie? 
 A friend of Emma's. 
 She moved to Tel Aviv. 
 Works at a bar called Brad's Pit. 
 Huh. 
 [phone chimes] 
 I gotta take this. 
 Yeah, good timing. 
 You'll never guess what I just found out. 
 Hopefully something better than what I found out. 
 Go on. 
 Emma had a boyfriend. 
 What? Who? 
 I don't know. Yet. 
 What's going on on your end? 
 The breastplate is gone. 
 What? 
 What do you mean, gone? 
 How? 
 Well, if I knew that, Peter, I would have it back in my possession. 
 Someone high up checked it out. 
 I don't know... I don't have clearance to find out who. 
 [beep beep] 
 Oh. 
 Hold on. My office is calling. 
 All right. Just call me when you're done. 
 [beep] 
 Yeah? 
 What? When? 
 Is she okay? 
 What hospital is she in?

 Peter : More! 
 Uh... thanks. 
 That was... that was lovely. 
 I'm afraid something's come up... at work. 
 Hi. Lynn Monahan. Where can I find her, please? 
 The fourth floor, trauma. 
 Elevators are down the hall to your left. 
 Thanks.

 I'm sorry I'm calling you so late. 
 We just, um... got some really bad news from the hospital. 
 [kettle whistling] 
 Okay. Thanks for telling me. 
 [shrill whistling] 
 [crying] He was just a kid! 
 [whispering] 
 [sobbing] I'm so sorry. 
 Peter : What exactly am I looking at here? 
 I told you. It was checked out with the highest security level clearance. 
 What's this? 
 What? 
 Oh. Nothing. 
 What? 
 You know, my son Giddy called me after school crying. 
 I'm trying to help him with his math. 
 I have to dip into my pension to keep paying for tutors. 
 His mother can't help him? 
 [sarcastic laugh] 
 She's a bigger idiot than I am. 
 I used to cover the math homework with my daughter. 
 I love math. 
 My wife would do the reading, writing, creative stuff, but... 
 I like math. 
 There's always a solution for every problem, you know? 
 You work hard enough, there's always an answer. 
 I could... come over some time, spend a couple of hours with Giddy. 
 See if we can get this stuff straightened out. 
 Really? 
 Sure. If you want. 
 So what do we know about this Julie except the fact that she works at a gay bar? 
 Gay bar? 
 The name Brad's Pit wasn't enough of a clue for you? 
 [laughing] 
 Don't make this end badly for all three of us. 
 [wind moaning] 
 Come here. 
 Lay down... and just get down. 
 Aah! 
 Charlie, get in the car. 
 [Charlie coughing] 
 Where's my stuff? 
 I have the stone. 
 Well, this is it.

 Hey.

 [singing to lyrical melody in Hebrew]

 Julie? 
 Ah, Mr. Blue eyes. 
 And his... boy toy. 
 I'm not into threesomes, so you can get out of here. 
 I'm Emma Wilson's father. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I am so sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 I'm flattered. 
 I came to Jerusalem to identify her body. 
 This is Detective Cohen. He's, uh, in charge of the investigation. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 So we were told you know something about a break-up Emma had before she died? 
 You saw her fighting with her boyfriend? 
 Yeah. I should have kicked the sh1t out of him the minute he laid a hand on her, kicked his teeth in at the curb, the old toad. 
 Old? 
 Don't worry. 
 I can see it wasn't a... father figure thing for Emma. 
 I mean, you're much better looking. 
 And nicer. 
 You don't happen to remember his name, by any chance, do you? 
 No. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh... the archeologist. 
 That's all I knew. 
 The archeologist? 
 Uh, yeah, someone she worked with? 
 [knocking loudly] 
 Professor Margrove! 
 [continues knocking] 
 He's coming. 
 What are you doing here at this hour? 
 You lying sack of sh1t. 
 You were sleeping with her, weren't you? 
 Weren't you? 
 woman : What's going on? 
 Good question... 
 Professor, you care to tell all of us or just me and my partner? 
 Be along in a moment. Usual problems at work. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 Obviously, I was lying. 
 I'm supposed to blow up my marriage about some troubled young woman's misdirected life? 
 This makes you the prime suspect in her murder. 
 You realize that. 
 Save yourself wasting time on that tangent. 
 Trust me. 
 Trust him. 
 Despite the eyewitness testimony that has you physically abusing Emma in the street the week she was killed. 
 Perhaps you should have had an alibi ready, Professor. 
 What? 
 Did I have an affair with Emma Wilson? Yes. 
 Did I take advantage with the sway that I held over her to satisfy my appetites? Absolutely. 
 And did I break it off when I realized the terrible mistake I'd made with a very complicated young woman? Yes. 
 But did I kill her? No. 
 Good story. Unfortunately, you still need an alibi, Professor. 
 I have an alibi... my wife. 
 We were home together the night that Emma was murdered. 
 Is that right? 
 I may lack morals, gentlemen, but I'm no killer. 
 There's dirt on these hands, in more ways than one, but look for blood on them, and you'll look in vain. 
 Now, if our business is done here, get off my property! 
 Boo! [giggles] 
 Almost ready? 
 Yeah. Almost. 
 I wanted to give you going-away gift. 
 Okay. 
 Avram, I don't bite. 
 I know. 
 Shh. 
 What was that? 
 [animals making noises] 
 What? 
 Oh. 
 Just that. 
 Your ride is almost here. 
 [knock at door] 
 I wake you? 
 Does it matter? 
 Can I come in? 
 You okay? 
 I'm... great. 
 You pissed off? 
 It's been a long day. It's late. 
 What do you need? 
 I, uh... 
 [sighs] 
 I need a warrant to search the Jerusalem Heritage Center, the place I told you about. 
 I'm pretty sure they're linked with Yussef Khalid and whatever got Vicki killed. 
 Emma. 
 Got Emma killed. 
 What's the difference, right? 
 Look, I didn't come here to talk about work. 
 I know what you're thinking... 
 I don't think you know what I'm thinking at all. 
 Sitting in a hospital bed, wondering if you're gonna show up... that is not what I signed up for. 
 Lynn... 
 You thought about coming by. 
 It's the thought that counts. 
 No. 
 Maybe. I don't know. 
 You do know, and so do I. 
 We're both to blame for this... [sighs] whatever it is. I won't call it an affair. 
 It's too romantic, but whatever it... this is never should have gone past the hotel lobby. 
 Good night. [sighs] 
 What about, uh, Nadav? How's he doing? 
 He died in surgery. 
 They called me an hour ago. 
 Look, have a good night, okay? 
 [engine rumbling] 
 [cow lows] 
 You found it. 
 Emil : Your sense of entitlement intact, I hope? 
 Is everything ready? 
 Pleased to meet you too. 
 [sighs] Avram. 
 What can I say? 
 Next year, in Jerusalem. 
 Let this be the last year any of us ever have to say that again. 
 Bye, Elena. 
 Good-bye Avram. 
 I'm sorry about the delay. 
 The stone. 
 [Geiger counter clicking] 
 I guess... my part is done. 
 There is one more job, Yussef. 
 We understand... that there is no greater assurance of life than... sacrificial death. 
 How easily we can lose sight of... why we strive to rebuild the temper: to honor God and make atonement with sacrifice. 
 The manhunt you have caused risks everything we've worked so hard to achieve. 
 [sobs] 
 [whispers] He's coming. 
 [gunshot] 
 I want Josh back. 
 By this time tomorrow. 
 The other two? 
 Any liabilities are to be... eliminated... Debbie, her boyfriend. 
 Anyone who has laid eyes on that boy.
