 Peter : Previously on  Dig... 
 For this prophecy to come true, they'd need... 
 A red heifer, a high priest. 
 It's undetectable. 
 Margrove : Something terrible is about to happen. 
 Meet me at the dig site right now. 
 Peter, Liat is dirty. 
 I never told her the package was a kid. 
 [grunting] 
 God damn it, Peter. Where are you? 
 You're not gonna believe this. 
 [tires screeching] 
 Over here. 
 What was so important you couldn't tell me on the phone? 
 You should probably see for yourself. 
 [tense music] 
 We're right below the foundation stone. 
 So the Dome of the Rock is up there. 
 For now, until the Order of Moriah destroys it all. 
 Destroys it how? 
 I wasn't paid to ask them questions. 
 They funded my dig. I took their money. 
 They hired me to get them to the Well of Souls, but I was interested in what lay 2 feet behind that wall. 
 A passageway called Warren's shaft. 
 Sir Charles Warren came the closest to finding the treasures 150 years ago. 
 I was going to pick up where he left off. 
 A couple of whacks with that pick, I'd be through the wall. 
 Just waiting for my time. 
 Much good it would do now. 
 I led them here, and now they're going to use it to destroy it all. 
 The foundation stone, the Al Aqsa, the Dome of the Rock. 
 Look, I may be an opportunist... 
 And an asshole. 
 Granted. But I'm not crazy. 
 If that mosque comes down, it'll be World War III up there. 
 Armageddon, the end of everything. 
 ♪ 
 Golan : God damn it, Peter. Where are you? 
 I know everything. He talked. 
 If what he told me is right, I think you're in great danger.

 Ah, sh1t. 
 [groans] 
 Ah, sh1t. No. 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 Hey, hey, hey, whoa. 
 No. It's all right. It's okay. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 No, no, no. 
 He's my friend, okay? He's my friend. 
 Hey, hey, just wait, wait. One second. 
 One second. Just... 
 man : Hey. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Hey! 
 Hey. What did you tell him? 
 Gregory, wake up. What did you tell him? 
 Gregory! Gre... [grunts] 
 Who's Rebecca? 
 [speaking Hebrew] 
 Who is Rebecca? 
 Who is Rebecca? 
 He's been identified by the boyfriend, so we can do the autopsy now. 
 I'm gonna find out who did this. 
 Does it matter? 
 Did Golan know anybody called Rebecca? 
 No. 
 Not that I know. 
 Rabbi. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Me too. 
 There are prophecies that say beware the blood moon. 
 A harbinger of the End of Days. I know. 
 Tomorrow night it will be full. 
 [tense music] 
 ♪ 
 Liat? 
 Liat, I know you can see me. Look at me, please. 
 Lynn, I did not want it to end this way. 
 Just take off the blindfold. 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 Please. 
 Please. 
 [grunts] 
 Ah! 
 [both grunting] 
 [techno music] 
 ♪ 
 Ah! 
 [gunshot] 
 [panting] 
 Ow. 
 [grunts] 
 I saw it on the news. 
 I couldn't believe it was him. 
 It's so awful. 
 He was onto something, so they killed him. 
 I thought you were with him. 
 No, I was with Margrove. 
 Margrove, why? 
 He called. 
 He found the Well of Souls. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Turns out he was working for the Order of Moriah like we thought, but now he wants out. 
 He's found out they're gonna destroy the whole temple mount. 
 From the Well of Souls? 
 But that doesn't make any sense. 
 I mean, if this whole thing is about rebuilding the temple, they can't do that without the foundation stone. 
 None of it makes any sense to me. 
 Maybe it should just all end. 
 All the pain and suffering in the world just... let everybody wipe each other out. 
 In the name of God. 
 No. 
 No, I can't let you do this, Peter. 
 We have to figure a way out of this. 
 I can't stop it. 
 I can't stop anything. 
 How did you get sandstone on your shirt? 
 What? 
 There's sandstone on your shirt. 
 Where'd it come from? 
 I don't know. The tunnels? 
 There's no sandstone in the tunnels. 
 The whole idea of tunnels is to bring water to the city. 
 Sandstone and water don't work. 
 "Follow the water." 
 Both Margrove and Donaldson said that. 
 "Follow the water." 
 Stay here. 
 Wait, where are you going? 
 To get a geology lesson. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Peter : I must have rubbed up against a wall somewhere about there. 
 That's impossible. That's the... 
 Right under the foundation stone. 
 They broke through to the Well of Souls. 
 That's incredible, but sandstone? No. 
 The entire temple mount will collapse. 
 There's a source of water there. 
 Peter : There's a pond there, off tunnel seven. 
 What's the source of that water? 
 Here. The dam at Beit Zait, above the city here, releases water that feeds these aquifers here. 
 So if the dam was destroyed, where would the water go? 
 Through these same tunnels, flooding them all. 
 Half the city would be under water, thousands of homes. 
 It would be chaos. 
 Jesus. 
 Unless... 
 There are escape routes beneath the city. 
 They're connected to the tunnels. 
 Yes. They connect here and here. 
 A set of large automated steel doors seal them off. 
 And if those doors were open, then the water would... 
 Would do what? 
 The protocol has never been enacted, thank God. 
 Especially given its name. 
 "Armageddon Protocol." 
 [sighs] 
 Did he buy it? 
 He should be finding out about the Armageddon Protocol right about now. 
 Let's go get our treasure. 
 [engine starts] 
 Josh : We need to talk. 
 Okay, let's talk. 
 Alone. 
 Josh, I'm sure you must be nervous, but I want to assure you there is nothing to worry about. 
 Both Faye and I will be right by your side. 
 No, you won't. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Your help in getting me to this point is very much appreciated, but just like Moses, you will not arrive at the promised land. 
 What the hell are you talking about, Josh? 
 I raised you for 13 years. 
 I'm the closest thing you have to a father. 
 My father is God. 
 You're no longer needed, Tad. 
 What? 
 You served your purpose, and you'll get your reward in the kingdom to come. 
 Now be gone. 
 I literally made you, you little sh1t. 
 You want to know the real story? Trust me, you... 
 I said go. 
 Go. 
 And send the tailor back in.

 And now I am no longer needed? 
 How dare he? 
 Maybe it's the jetlag. 
 It's a test. 
 A test? 
 Yes. 
 God is putting us through a final test. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Something has happened to the boy. 
 Mm. Just like the first Josh. 
 No matter what we did, how we followed protocol, it never took because God never intended it to take. 
 Pastor... 
 Perhaps Satan himself has entered the boy. 
 We need to continue on our path but without him. 
 Without him? 
 I raised those boys. I carried them to term myself. 
 Don't you see, Faye? 
 There is no Josh anymore. 
 But I have devoted 13 years for this. 
 I am the one who should sacrifice the cow, not the boy. 
 I know what needs to be done. 
 You're thinking of your ego, not of God. 
 We must get rid of the demon. 
 God speaks clearly, and what God wants now...

 Forget the gun. 
 You need to get to a member of the Israeli government who can enact something called the Armageddon Protocol. 
 Lynn : The what? 
 They're going to blow up the dam at Beit Zait, flood the city through the tunnels. 
 Uh, Moshe Krugman, the Defense Minister, just walked in with Ridell. 
 I don't know whose side he's on though. 
 Well, get to him and find out. 
 Is she gonna do it? 
 Even if she does, it's not going to save the Dome of the Rock. 
 Why? 
 Because they dug through the tunnels to the Well of Souls. 
 It's sandstone. 
 The water would go straight in there. 
 Everything would crumble.
