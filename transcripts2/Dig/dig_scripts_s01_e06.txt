 Previously, on  Dig... 
 Don't touch her! 
 This Yussef Khalid, he took some kind of stone? 
 Any idea what that's about? 
 Lynn : No. 
 [gunshots ringing] 
 [dramatic music] 
 I want Josh back. 
 woman : The other two? 
 Any liabilities are to be eliminated. 
 This affair never should have gone past the hotel lobby. 
 Did I have an affair with Emma Wilson? 
 Yes. 
 Did I kill her? No. 
 woman : This is tunnel seven... we got too close to the Temple Mount. 
 No one's allowed to dig near there. 
 There is no greater assurance of life than sacrificial death.

 I'm still on parole. This is so messed up. 
 What the hell are they gonna do to him in that place? 
 It's a long story. 
 Well, now's as good a Goddamn time as any to let me know. 
 It's all about the end of days. 
 The what? 
 Armageddon. 
 The Rapture. 
 In order to bring about the Second Coming, the Temple in Jerusalem needs to be rebuilt. 
 They need a high priest to do that. 
 So that's why they need Josh. 
 What? [laughs] 
 That kid? A high priest? 
 What's that, like, some kind of superhero, or something? 
 I believed them. 
 I just didn't think they'd go this far. 
 I mean, they killed the other one. 
 Are you clean? 
 Yes! 
 Okay, look. 
 We'll sleep here for a few hours, then we'll drive to Albuquerque. 
 They have to have an FBI office there. 
 We'll go there tomorrow morning and tell them everything. 
 Okay? 
 Liat : Maybe it's some kind of an architectural blueprint. 
 Yeah, this could be a room with a tunnel leading to it over there. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Or the whole thing's a symbol, or a mark, or something. 
 Run it through the FBI and Interpol databases. 
 Something I should know about? 
 No, not really. 
 It's a symbol I saw in Emma Wilson's journal, and I saw it again, last night, at the dig site. 
 Wait, are you in possession of the victim's journal? 
 No. 
 I was. I handed it over. 
 Followed protocol. 
 The whole case just took a turn. 
 What? 
 Two kids found Yussef Khalid's body in the woods this morning. 
 Apparently, he did us all a favor and killed himself. 
 It still doesn't tell us who killed Emma Wilson. 
 Well, we're gonna let the local police deal with that. 
 I need everyone focused on security for the Secretary of State's visit. 
 I need you to stop what you're doing, shift gears, and regain some perspective. 
 Or risk compromising your position here. 
 Is this about me not coming to the hospital last night? 
 Because I apologized for that. 
 This has nothing to do with that. 
 I'm a legal attache. You're my deputy. 
 I'm telling you what to do. 
 Right. 
 Peter, I think I got something. 
 What? 
 The symbol showed up with a match to a missing person case here in Jerusalem six months ago. 
 Gregory Donaldson. 
 Found after three days, delirious and unconscious. 
 Still alive? 
 Yup. 
 It looks like they admitted him to Shalvata Psychiatric Institute.

 Dr. Frankel : We usually keep him heavily sedated to prevent him from harming himself. 
 Or anyone else, for that matter. 
 Gregory, you have a visitor. 
 My name's Peter Connelly. 
 I'm with the American consulate here. 
 I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's okay. 
 We believe his psychotic state is a form of Jerusalem Syndrome. 
 What? 
 Oh, we see hundreds of cases a year. 
 Pilgrims, tourists who come to Jerusalem, become overwhelmed by the history, the religious fervor. 
 They hallucinate, lose track of time, hear voices. 
 Can I see his, um... 
 Jesus. 
 Can I take a look at this, please, Gregory? 
 What is this? Gregory, this symbol here, what is that? 
 [eerie music] 
 ♪ 
 Jehoshaphat? 
 What does that mean, Gregory? 
 Jehoshaphat. Why did you write that? 
 The fixation. 
 Common to a psychotic episode. 
 They single out one word, one concept, and obsess on repeating and... 
 Hey. Hey.

 I'm very sorry. 
 Usually, he's quite docile on his medication. 
 It's fine. 
 Does he have any visitors? 
 Someone I can talk to about him? 
 Friends or family? 
 Um... 
 woman : Gregory Donaldson.

 There is a young woman who has been visiting consistently. 
 They seem very close.

 Hi, do you speak English? 
 Um, my name is Peter Connelly. 
 I'm with the consulate here. 
 I can't help you. Go away. 
 Wait. Hold on. 
 I'm just trying to find out if anybody knows anything about this. 
 [phone beeps] 
 [knock at door] 
 So what'd they say? 
 They put me on hold for a while, so I hung up. 
 I mean, I couldn't think what to say that wouldn't sound crazy. 
 Listen, first thing tomorrow morning, we're gonna tell them in person. 
 This whole thing is gonna be over. 
 They haven't seen me in, like, three years. 
 I was just looking in the mirror, and... 
 I look older. 
 You are still so beautiful. 
 Hey... 
 I got a 20 on their location. 
 Sahara Springs Motel on Route 17. 
 Billingham : Don't do anything yet. 
 I'm sending someone.

 [clang] 
 We met at a cafe called Sergei. 
 [liquid pouring] 
 He was a very sweet American. 
 We moved in together after a couple of weeks. 
 Then one day, he got a package in the mail. 
 His father died when he was three. 
 On Gregory's 21st birthday, his adoption file was unsealed, and he received the letter from his father. 
 What did the letter say? 
 I don't know. 
 I just know he wasn't the same man after that. 
 He got really depressed and paranoid. 
 He kept talking about people who were after him. 
 What people? 
 He called them The Order of Moriah. 
 He was convinced they were some secret society that had to do with his father's death. 
 And then, one day, he just disappeared. 
 And they found him a week later in the tunnels below the old city. 
 He had carved that thing into his chest. 
 I should have believed what he was telling me. 
 Do you still have the package? 
 Someone from the police or the Shin Bet came to the house few days later. 
 They took everything. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 I lost someone close to me. 
 I know how painful it is. 
 Wait. 
 They took everything but this. 
 I don't know what it is or where it opens. 
 But I know Greg wouldn't have wanted them to have it.

 Hey, Liat, I need a favor. 
 Just between us. 
 I'm gonna send you a picture of a key. 
 It has a serial number on it. 
 I need you to try and track it for me. 
 All right. Thanks.

 You warm enough? 
 Yes, thank you. 
 Listen, I know you must be scared. 
 I know you must have a lot of questions right now. 
 But I want you to know you're safe. 
 I would never hurt you. 
 I'd never let anyone hurt you. 
 We don't need that anymore, right? 
 [suspenseful music] 
 ♪ 
 
 
 
 I don't know. 
 Something doesn't look right. 
 Yeah. Well, looks can be deceiving. 
 You sometimes pass for a cop. [slaps back] 
 Think about it. What's this guy's connection to Yussef Khalid? 
 The clay pot with the ashes, Jerusalem Heritage Center? 
 He worked at Cafe Sergei. 
 He had access. 
 So we don't have a connection yet. 
 Doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 
 No! 
 Did you ever hear of The Order of Moriah? 
 I saw them in concert a few years back. 
 Pretty good. Why? 
 It's a secret society. 
 The symbol was in Emma's journal. 
 Also showed up in the missing person's file from Jerusalem. 
 An American kid. 21 years old. 
 Gregory Donaldson. 
 He carved the symbol on his chest. 
 I went to see him in a psychiatric institution. 
 What did he say? 
 Nothing... he can't. 
 His brain is fried. So I talked to the girlfriend. 
 Shh. 
 Stop! 
 [grunting] 
 You okay? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Come on. I got you. 
 [whispering]: He hit me right in the nose. 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 What the hell do you think you're doing? 
 You're supposed to show him the symbol. 
 You said you'd show him the symbol. 
 Let me do my job. 
 Well, you didn't do it. 
 That's not the guy. 
 And you know that how? 
 Because it's ridiculous. It's too convenient. 
 Well, that's called police work. 
 I've tracked the evidence. Tied him to Emma Wilson. 
 You tracked... how did you tie... 
 That's my job. 
 They're trying to drag us off the trail. 
 You're following the wrong lead. 
 And what lead should we... 
 Gregory Donaldson. 
 We need to find out who carved the symbol into his chest. 
 The symbol from the victim's diary. 
 The symbol you were supposed to be showing him. 
 They're the people who killed her. 
 He's a patsy. 
 You have a serious problem, you know that? 
 You drive everyone nuts. 
 You talk too much. You think too much. 
 I'm done following your crazy theories. 
 This is my suspect. 
 Stay out of my business. 
 Just ask him about The Order of Moriah! 
 Lynn, listen to me, Detective Cohen has been in there for hours, and the guy is not talking. 
 I'm sure he's being very persuasive. 
 Just give it some time. 
 He's got the wrong guy and he's asking the wrong questions. 
 I need you to get him transferred to my custody. 
 I don't have that kind of jurisdiction. 
 Then get authorization for me to question him. 
 Pull some rank. 
 Peter, I don't have rank over the local police, you know that. 
 Peter : Then call in a favor. 
 I need five minutes with this guy. 
 Hold on. 
 What's going on in there? 
 He's getting ready to make a statement. 
 He wants to confess. 
 What? 
 Congratulations. 
 sh1t. 
 I got to call you back. 
 Can you get me a car downstairs please? 
 I got to go to the police station. 
 [panting] 
 Oh... 
 Josh, what are you doing out here? 
 I found these in there. 
 Oh, I guess it's your lucky day. 
 Here.

 Open the top. It's a toy. 
 Satan isn't a toy. 
 Different people believe in different things. 
 Why did you take me from the compound? 
 To protect you. 
 From what? My teachers? 
 You think that everything they've taught me is a lie. 
 Don't you? 
 Come here. Look. 
 You see that? 
 You see how beautiful that is? 
 God did that. 
 Created it all. 
 The good, the bad. 
 Everything. 
 It's all I know. 
 Pastor Billingham says that every star represents a soul. 
 And that there's a place where all these souls reside called The Well of Souls. 
 Beneath the ancient temple in Jerusalem. 
 Is that a lie, too?

 Sure. I can hold.

 Maybe a week, maybe a month, your suspected killer in there is gonna be found dead in his cell. 
 They'll tell you he killed himself like Yussef Khalid, and the case will be closed.
