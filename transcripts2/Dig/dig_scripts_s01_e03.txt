 male narrator : Previously on Dig... 
 Emma : You're the one I saw earlier with a gun. 
 This is pretty much as holy as water gets, if you believe in that sort of thing. 
 It says here Margrove is overseeing a dig near the southern wall. 
 Golan : Let's pay him a visit. 
 What's this got to do with me? 
 You sponsored a work permit. 
 Along with four dozen other interns who come here every summer. 
 He would've been 13 today. 
 It is of great importance that we know now what is in your heart, Debbie. 
 That boat, where's it going? 
 man : Croatia. 
 man on TV : Brazen escape of Yussef Khalid, an American citizen wanted... 
 You have to make the delivery now. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Did you get him? 
 No. 
 I think I know where he is. 
 Ridell : You picked a hell of a time for this. 
 One more stone left to find. 
 The most difficult one. 
 Now, get the hell out of here the same way you came in. 
 I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister for joining us in welcoming Mr. Dennis Barnette to Israel. 
 [applause] 
 Ridell : Dennis is making enormous efforts to broker an historic agreement in the Middle East. 
 Ridell : As I was saying... 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Yussef Khalid is in the building. 
 What? 
 The CCTV center in Jerusalem tracked him. 
 I followed him here. 
 He's in the Consulate? 
 He must be. 
 He must be? 
 You're either sure, or you're not. 
 I think he is. 
 A wanted killer in the United States just walked into the Consulate. 
 I know what it sounds like. 
 It sounds insane. 
 What sounds insane? 
 I'm just getting a debriefing from an ongoing... 
 I'm sorry for barging in there like that. 
 Peter, don't. 
 What? 
 I don't know how he got in here. 
 I don't know what he's planning. 
 But I have reason to believe that Yussef Khalid is in the Consulate right now. 
 We don't know anything for certain. 
 I have the Prime Minister of Israel and half of his cabinet on the other side of this door. 
 Is he here or not? 
 Yes, ma'am. He is. 
 Madame Ambassador. 
 Evacuate the building. 
 [people chattering] 
 [alarm ringing] 
 Madame Ambassador, he's not in the building. 
 Search it again. 
 We checked every corner of every office. 
 Peter : Then check the security cameras. 
 We have. 
 Yussef Khalid did not enter this building. 
 [man singing in Hebrew] 
 "It's all about 19." 
 All about 19. 
 Best pastrami sandwich shop. 
 [knock at door] 
 [sighs] 
 Let me guess, you spent the last hour and a half trying to persuade the ambassador that I'm not a certifiable lunatic. 
 Screw her. 
 Besides, how I am supposed to convince her of something that I'm not so sure of myself? 
 So what are you doing in the hotel room of a lunatic? 
 Oh, you know me... Three-hour state dinner, fake terrorist threat. I like to wind down. 
 Well, in that case, I should probably mention what I forgot in all the chaos. 
 You're looking incredibly beautiful tonight. 
 [laughing] Please. 
 Like you noticed. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mmm. 
 [man singing in Hebrew] 
 [both moaning] 
 [dissonant music] 
 [knock at door] 
 [retching] 
 Food. 
 [laughter] 
 Debbie. 
 Thank you for joining us. 
 What is this about? 
 Now that Joshua is a young man, it's time he became acclimated to the real world. 
 What do you need us to do? 
 I want you to take him into town, buy him ice cream, take him to a video arcade. 
 Allow him to experience things other kids his age get to experience. 
 And you want both of us to go. 
 Is there a problem with that? 
 I'll be just a second. 
 Wait for me outside. 
 Have you forgotten what she has done? 
 I am perfectly capable of taking Joshua on my own. 
 Trust I have my reasons. 
 Just keep your eyes open.

 Ingmar : I must admit, I was surprised by the call. 
 Usually when buyers want to contact me... 
 Bar Kokhba coins are my boss's passion. 
 When he sees something he likes, he goes for it. 
 I'm very aware of Mr. Onami's reputation. 
 What a spectacular view. 
 You sure know how to spoil your guests, Mr. Ingmar. 
 It's a beautiful house. 
 It was a crusader's fort. 
 Ingmar : It dates back to the 11th century. 
 I bought it for nothing 15 years ago when no one wanted to live in this neighborhood. 
 Not a bad place to come to work every day, huh? 
 Not at all.

 Ingmar : My life's work. 
 Yussef : Wow. 
 [whistles] 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Ingmar : The collection is mostly antiquities unearthed in excavations in Israel during the British Mandate. 
 This is prehistoric finds all the way to the Ottoman Empire, and this is from the Second Temple period. 
 What's this? 
 Ingmar : You have a very good eye, Mr. Buecker. 
 That's 1 of 12 stones that decorated the high priest's breastplate in the Temple. 
 Fascinating. 
 How much is it? 
 Oh, priceless. 
 And for that reason, it's not for sale. 
 So... 
 Bar Kokhba coin. 
 It's exquisite. 
 Peter : When did you first have any kind of contact with Miss Wilson? 
 About a week ago? Maybe ten days. 
 She told me there's something she wanted me to test. 
 She told me she doesn't want to use any regular channels and that this is a personal favor for her. 
 Is that weird? 
 Yes, it is.

 And... 
 A cow. 
 The substance came from a cow.

 Hello? 
 What? Speak. 
 I need food. 
 I can't help.

 You can all enjoy steak tonight.

 Oh, hey, darling. 
 Can we please have three milkshakes? 
 All we have is vanilla.

 Ma'am, I said all we got is vanilla. 
 You okay with that? 
 Yes. 
 It's my favorite anyway. 
 Okay, I'll bring it over to your table.

 I don't hear from you for three years. 
 Listen, I don't have time to explain. 
 I need you to wire me some money, Charlie. 
 I need to get out of here.

 Josh : Debbie, where's Faye? 
 Debbie : Officer. 
 Officer, we need to talk to you. 
 So she's scared. 
 She doesn't want anyone at the dig to know she's testing the sample. 
 Thinking her boss, Margrove? 
 Peter : Yeah, who else? 
 You know, he lied to us about knowing her.
