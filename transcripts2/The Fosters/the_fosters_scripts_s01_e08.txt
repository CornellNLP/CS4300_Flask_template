 Previously on The Fosters... 
 Hope you're pacing yourself, Mike. 
 Dad, I'm gonna miss this audition. Where are you? 
 You were late. 
 I'm sorry. 
 And you stink like booze. 
 Or maybe I should just tell moms, who you've been talking to. 
 I wish I could help, but I don't have any more. 
 I mean, there probably is something at your house, something that your moms wouldn't miss. And I could sell it. 
 I should have realised that you were never into Brandon. 
 He's into you. 
 Oh, we're walking home Why don't you come with us? 
 Oh, no. I'm staying. 
 Are you sure you're ok? 
 I'm great. 
 You're not sending me to boarding school. 
 I don't know what they told you... 
 I'm undocumented. 
 And so are you. And if you send me anywhere, I'll call immigration myself. 
 Stay away from me, stay away from Sarah, or else you're... 
 Wyatt, let him go! 
 I told you to stay out of it and now you've made it worse. 
 Fine, I'll stay out of it for good. 
 [Classical music] 
 Hey, I wanted you to know I spoke with Bill, and Sarah has been removed from the Olmstead's. 
 And I've got a friend at the DA's office that I'm talking to about Liam. 
 I will let you know what happens, but just wanted you to know. 
 Ok. 
 Ok. 
 Oh, Jesus... I made that from scratch with really good cheese. 
 It's great. 
 It's a lost cause, babe. 
 Somebody pass me the tabasco? 
 Oh... 
 I'm kidding. Kidding. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I like this. 
 I got to play this tomorrow for the grim reaper. 
 Grim reaper? 
 His music teacher. 
 He scares the crap out of me. 
 Hey, miss thing. You know the rule no phones at the table. 
 Brandon has his computer down here. 
 I'm studying. 
 Yeah, right. Me, too. 
 Before I take that away, what's so funny? 
 Just this thing that Lexi sent me. You wouldn't get it. 
 Did she just call me old? 
 Yep. 
 Phone, now. Please. 
 Lexi must be excited, she gets to come back to school tomorrow. 
 Her parents are letting her come back? 
 That's cool. 
 They don't have much of a choice. 
 Unless they want a visit from immigration. 
 Blackmailing your parents isn't anything to be proud of. 
 No matter how mad she is at them. 
 They deserved it. I mean, what was Lexi supposed to do? 
 Let them send her off to that convent? 
 It's a girls' school. 
 Same difference. 
 I just hope they put this all behind them. They're a family. 
 In the end, that's all that matters. 
 All right, who's going to want dessert? 
 We actually made apple tarts. 
 If I see ketchup, you're going to die. 
 Don't forget dinner with Gretchen tomorrow night. 
 Yes. 
 You'll finally meet her. 
 We're going to leave money for you guys so you can order. 
 The fabled ex is in town. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Oh, my God, I almost forgot we have a land line. 
 Is that what that is? 
 Gretchen? Your ex-girlfriend? 
 Ooh, the one who hangs out with movie stars? 
 Is she pretty? 
 Yeah, she's pretty, but she's not nearly as pretty as your mom. 
 Well played, hon. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Can somebody get that? 
 It's got to be a sales call. 
 We should just get rid of it. No one ever uses it anyway. 
 Hello? 
 Mariana, it's for you. 
 If that's Lexi, please tell her we're still eating dinner. 
 Hello? 
 [Stef] Thinking about having a tart? 
 [Laughs] Oh, wait. You already have one. 
 Thank you... anybody else? Apple tart? Apple tart? 
 Look, you can't call me here. 
 [Ana] What choice do I have? You just keep ignoring me. 
 You think it's easy getting to a computer? 
 If they find out I was talking to you... 
 Why haven't you answered any of my emails? 
 Look, I can't give you anymore money. I don't even have any. 
 [Stammers] You said, that... maybe there was something in your house that wouldn't be missed. 
 You said that. Look, I'm not stealing from my mothers. 
 I'm your mother. 
 Look, I'm sorry, but I can't talk. 
 Who was that? 
 * It's not where you come from * 
* it's where you belong * 
* nothing I would trade * 
* I wouldn't have it any other way * 
* you're surrounded by love and you're wanted * 
* so never feel alone * 
* you're at home with me * 
* right where you belong * 
 [playing classical music] 
 Stop. Stop. 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 No. But you didn't do anything right either. 
 When you were playing just now, what were you feeling? 
 Um... [clears throat] 
 Uh... I don't know. 
 Exactly. 
 If playing notes were all there was to this, we could program a machine to do it. 
 I'm just trying to get it right. 
 And there's your problem. 
 You have to stop trying to get it right. 
 I would rather you made a hundred mistakes than play it perfectly without... risking anything. 
 You know, Beethoven started going deaf when he was 26. 
 He contemplated suicide. 
 Imagine the world without the ninth symphony. 
 I'd rather not, frankly. 
 The point is, instead of killing himself, he used his pain to create something beautiful. 
 I don't think I have that much pain. 
 Thanks for lending this to me. 
 Big thumbs up to Joan Didion. 
 Yeah. 
 I can definitely see what Timothy meant by her writing was a hostile act. 
 Speaking of hostile, are you mad at me about the other day? 
 'Cause I yelled at you for hitting Liam? 
 I'm having a little trouble holding up both ends of this conversation, Wyatt. 
 What do you want me to say? I got reamed for protecting you. 
 Like I was the bad guy or something. 
 Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. 
 It's just... things with Liam are really complicated. 
 You're probably right. 
 It's probably way over my head. 
 No. No, it's not that. 
 Liam... 
 Why don't you go tell Brandon. 
 You two seem pretty tight. 
 Wyatt... there's nothing going on between me and Brandon. 
 So, tell me about Liam. 
 I knew him a couple of years ago, from an old foster home, and thankfully, he's out of my life and I would just like to forget about him. 
 Wow, you really opened up there. 
 I thought that's what you liked about me. 
 That I'm mysterious. A little bit screwed up... 
 You know, you might be a little too screwed up. 
 Even for me. 
 [Low-tempo music] 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Um... I know this is really weird, but this weekend is... was our anniversary. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Um, I... I got these for you a while back as a surprise before, you know. 
 Wow. The weepies. 
 I know. 
 You should use them. 
 Oh... 
 Yeah, I really can't. 
 Why not? I want you to. 
 I just don't want you to get the wrong idea. 
 No, I know. 
 It's not what I meant. 
 You just loved the band so much, I want you to go. 
 Right. 
 Thank you. Um... 
 I just can't. 
 I got plans... 
 Ok... 
 I've got to get to class. 
 Later. 
 Jesus! 
 Oh, hey. 
 Hey. 
 I've been looking for you all day. Where've you been? 
 Around. I tried to find you at lunch. 
 Yeah, I had a makeup test for bio. It was faking impossible. 
 All that endocrine system stuff? 
 I'm pretty sure I failed. 
 Uh-huh. Good. 
 So, you want to hang out? 
 You mean, right now? 
 Well, yeah. 
 I can't, I'm sorry. Tomorrow? 
 Sure. Tomorrow. 
 Great. I got to go. I'm glad you're back. 
 Don't let her get to you. 
 She's not our mom, she's a con artist. 
 I'm just going to tell her to leave me alone, ok? 
 Like you didn't do before all those other times? 
 Look, I know what she is, all right? 
 Even if you don't believe that. 
 Even if I did believe that I wouldn't let you come here alone. 
 This isn't exactly La Jolla. 
 This is it. 
 Nice. 
 [Dog barking] 
 Are you ok? 
 You came. 
 Oh, my God. Jesus... 
 Can I get you something to drink? 
 Or maybe something to eat? 
 [Mariana] No. 
 Oh. 
 We can't stay. 
 I was hoping... 
 We just came to tell you in person that we can't give you any money. 
 So, please stop asking and calling. 
 You don't understand. It's not what you think. 
 If you knew... I was trying to tell you on the phone last night. 
 [Door slams, footsteps] 
 Evan, these are my kids. 
 Mariana and Jesus. 
 I'm out of cigarettes. 
 Can you get me some soda? 
 You got money? 
 Later. 
 Is that your boyfriend? 
 [Sniffs] I don't want him to be. 
 Not anymore. He's... 
 If I try to leave... you see what he's like. 
 That's why I asked for money. To get out of here. 
 I need to get a bus ticket. 
 I was going to go to San Francisco. 
 I have a cousin there. 
 Last time you told me the money was for rehab. 
 It was, it was... but now, I got to get out of town. 
 He always has drugs, he's always high. 
 I try to say no, but he gets so angry at me. 
 Jesus... 
 We can't give you money. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Indistinct police radio] 
 That's what, your third one today? 
 No way, mom. I can hold my coffee. 
 You look like hell, Mike. What's going on? 
 Nothing. 
 I've just been working extra shifts to pay for Brandon's piano lessons. 
 Not easy being a patron of the arts. 
 I'm just tired, that's all. 
 You sure about that? 
 Because at Mariana's quinceanera you got so loaded. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Ok, that doesn't work. 
 [Car honks] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Dispatch. This is two adam twenty. 
 We are code 6 at Oak and Talmadge. 
 License number: 3-Paul-Charles-Ida-2-9-4. 
 [Operator] Two adam twenty, be advised. Code 6 Sam. 
 10-4. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 What idiot steals a car then runs a stop sign in front of a cop. 
 We're not dealing with Einstein here. 
 Put your hands on the wheel where I can see them! 
 Is something wrong? 
 Turn the car off! 
 With your left hand, put the keys on the roof of the car. 
 With that same hand, open the door from the outside. 
 Get out! Put your hands on your head. Face away from me. 
 Hey man, I just blew through a stop sign. 
 Want my advice? 
 [Groans] 
 Don't talk. 
 [Grunts] 
 Damn it, Mike! 
 Stop! 
 I said, stop! 
 Get... down! 
 Stef... 
 Mike, a little advice. Don't talk. 
 [Door opens] 
 Just checking in. 
 You seemed kind of... you know, this afternoon. 
 I don't need a whole speech on what a user our birth mother is. 
 She knows what to say. 
 She makes stuff up, Jesus. 
 She didn't make up that skeezy ass boyfriend. 
 What? You think if we give her money for bus fare she's really going to buy a ticket? 
 I told her no money, didn't I? 
 Did you mean it? 
 Yeah. 
 That doesn't mean I can't feel bad for her. 
 [Phone buzzes] 
 [Piano playing] 
 Ah-ha, I really hear the difference, babe. 
 Your teacher's good, huh? 
 I guess. 
 Well, that's very nice of your dad to pay for those lessons. 
 I hope you let him know how much you appreciate it. 
 Yes, I do. I tell him all the time. 
 How is he doing, your old dad? 
 You spend more time with him than I do. 
 Yeah, but we're on duty. That's different. 
 He just seems a little off these days. 
 I mean, I know that you had to drive him home from Mariana's party, yes? 
 He was hung-over when he picked me up for my audition with Marshall. 
 Yeah, so, if you're asking me if he's drinking again... 
 Yes. 
 You said "drinking again." 
 You knew he was drinking before? 
 [Scoffs] Yeah. 
 When? 
 The divorce. 
 But you were little. You can't... 
 I heard you guys fighting. 
 I'm very sorry... 
 I should've never let that happen. 
 No, that's ok, mom. I would've known anyway. 
 I mean... 
 What? 
 No, nothing... 
 What, Brandon? 
 One time, he sort of... drove off the road with me in the car. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I was afraid to. 
 Did you tell you to keep quiet about this? 
 No, I was afraid if you knew, that you wouldn't let me see him again. 
 That's why. 
 What happened out there yesterday? 
 The suspect broke the hold and took off running... 
 Yeah, I can read, officer. 
 I me, how did you let this happen? 
 You know, you're damn lucky he ran instead of grabbing Mike's gun. 
 It was my fault, Captain. I thought I had better control of him. 
 We had no reason to suspect that he would resist. 
 He was cooperative. 
 That's just beautiful. 
 You two done having each other's backs? 
 Mike, you can leave. 
 [Roberts sighs] 
 [Clears throat] 
 All right, I want the truth. What is going on with him? 
 Is he drinking again? 
 Ok, everybody, I have to run to the office. 
 You have plenty to keep you busy. 
 [Laughing] 
 [Boy 1] Again, let's see it again. 
 What's so funny, Garner? 
 You want to see? 
 [Laughing, yelling] 
 Woo! You're recording this? 
 Oh, my God! I spilled. 
 [Cheering, laughing] 
 [Whistling, cheering] [Garner] Wait, wait. Here it goes again. [Boys laughing] Hey! You're a douche, Garner. Talya, wait up. Are you ok? Do I look ok? Look, Talya, all of this will be old news before you know it. Tomorrow, kelsey will fall on her butt in the quad, or someone will throw up in the fountain, and everyone will forget about this. It's easy for you to say. No, I know what it's like when everyone's looking at you weird, whispering about you after you walk by. It sucks. Big time. But you get over it. - I have to fix my make-up. [Mike] Well, thanks a lot. [Stef] What? You just got a new partner until further notice. Why, what's going on? Oh, come on, Stef. You told Roberts I was drinking. She put me on desk duty. I never said you were drinking. You didn't say I wasn't. I'm not going to lie for you, Mike. The truth is you are drinking. The quinceanera? You were drinking. That was a party. Was it a party last night? The night before that? [Laughs] Wow. Everybody has a drink after work, Stef. No, Mike, everybody doesn't. Have I ever come to work drunk? Wow. That's a pretty low bar you're setting there. Want another partner? Guess you got one. I love your necklace. It's thai, isn't it? Mango wood. If you say so, you're the world traveler. Stef bought it for me. Smart move meeting your ex. You want to make a statement. Oh, don't flatter yourself. Oh, come on, I meant your wife. Don't worry, she will be here. Now tell me, how long have you guys been together? Ten years. Wow. Two kids. Three. One from her marriage... To a man... And the twins, who we fost-adopted when they were five. And we are fostering a couple more. Why didn't you ever get pregnant? You always wanted kids. And I have them. Right. Of course. Oh, oh... either your wife is here, or there's a bachelor party going on. I am so sorry, honey. I got stuck at work. You didn't have time to change? I'm Gretchen, and I happen to like a lady in uniform. Why, thank you. You're welcome. You look like you could use a drink. You have no idea. You can't drink in uniform. Who says I'm staying in uniform? I'll have a Martini, please. How do you like it? Dirty. Ooh, I knew I was going to like you. Make that two, please. And for you? I'll have whatever red you have by the glass, please. Pinot. She can't handle anything full bodied. Oh, I don't know about that. [Laughs] Loving you. But remember how sick you got on that Bordeaux in Paris? She threw up in the Concorde fountain, it was très romantique. Never heard that story. I got a lot of stories about our lovely Lena. So, enough about me. Oh, I'm getting the look. What look? Oh, you know, the look that says, "proceed with caution." I don't have a look. You have a look, honey. The left eyebrow goes up. [Gretchen] And her posture get very... [Both] ... Regal. Like that. [Laughing] It's one of the many things I love about you. 
 
 Where is everyone? Your moms are at that dinner and everyone else ate. You might want to warm that. Oh. That was pretty bad today, what happened in algebra. Well... Hey, maybe you should cut Talya a break. Are you serious? Where is this coming from? I don't know. She apologized... But the journal wasn't the only reason I broke up with her. I mean, she turned into a whiny, jealous mess. Maybe she had a right to be jealous. Ok, well, that doesn't explain the video. She got drunk because she felt really stupid. She saw me with Wyatt, and I don't know, she thinks we're together. She just realized that she had it all wrong. Did she? I mean, are you with Wyatt? I don't know. Maybe... not really. Then why would she think that? [Microwave beeps] Your pizza's ready. [Laughing] Thank you. So, have you ever shot someone? Oh, luckily I haven't had to, no. What do you do with your gun at home? With the kids and all. Oh, I lock it up. Can we change the subject? She hates guns. I know. She doesn't like to talk about my work. I can't believe she agreed to date you. I took her home for Christmas one year... Please, not that story. Oh come on, it's a sweet story. My dad's a hunter. Oh no. Made us go to the shooting range... Lena got one shooff, burst into tears. I swear. Oh, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. [Waiter] No rush. Any time you're ready. Thank you... No, no, no. I insist. I invited you guys. You're my guests. Next time is on us then. Great. As long as it's not another 10 years from now. How long are you here for? Couple of days. Why don't you have dinner with us tomorrow night? Absolutely. You can meet the kids. Yeah. Yeah? Sure you're not sick of me? [Both] Not at all. Hey... No, you can't copy my history homework. And I've got a ton left to do here. So, you talk. I'll pretend to listen. I just wanted to say you were 100 percent right about Ana. Ok. You must want something. We can't give her money, but maybe we can help her get into a women's shelter. I found a list of them. No. They're free. We take her there and drop her off. And then she'll say she needs money to live on. For toothpaste or food. Or whatever. Only she won't buy food with it. This is what she does. She gets in your head and makes you feel bad for her. And then she uses you. We can never go back to that house again. Okay? You have to promise me. I promise. That was delicious! Right? [Laughing] Thank you again, that was very generous. Oh, I'm expecting a gourmet meal tomorrow night. I can't promise gourmet. Oh, Lena's a good cook. Mm-hm. Just don't let her make pot roast. [Laughs] Oh, I sense another story. I think we've had enough stories for one night. Ah, this is me. I will see you tomorrow. Goodbye. Nice to meet you. Be safe. What's wrong? Did you have to invite her over? She's going to come meet the kids. She just bought us a very expensive meal. Money is easy for Gretchen. Ok, she's your ex. I was just trying to be nice. You were kind of ganging up on me. What are you talking about? "The look?" What? You have a look. This is why I don't hang out with exes. Well... she was a little "fabulous" but I like her. And no one was ganging up on you. It doesn't bother you that we were together for 18 months over a decade ago, and she acts like she knows me better than you? No, because she doesn't. Come on, it's an ex thing. "I had her first." Mike does it, too. You look beautiful. Uh, she said you're going to pay for it. [Laughs] You're telling me. [Down-tempo music] [Whistle blows] Funny. That's for not telling me why you blew me off yesterday. Mariana says you guys went to go see your birth mom. Which is cool. As long as that's the only reason you've been avoiding me. I have not been avoiding you. You sure about that? Yeah, I just... I got a lot on my mind right now. What's going on? Why are you acting so weird? Because your parents found out about us? No, it's because I found out about them. And about me. Lexi, you're as American as I am. I still feel the same about you. Nothing's changed. Everything's changed. Every time I see a police car, I can barely catch my breath. Hey. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you. I promise. That's sweet. But that's not really a promise you can keep. I just feel so freaking alone. You're not alone. You've got your parents, you've got Mariana... You've got me. Hey. Peace, ok? You're like my only friend here, so you kind of have to talk to me... whether you like it or not. That's progress. Excellent. Um... I have to see this silent film at the Luxe for my photography class. Do you want to go with me? Can't talk during the movie, so it'll be just like now. I can't. I have a thing. [Laughs] Ok. Well, when your thing gets boring, you know where to find me. [Dog barking] Yeah? Hey. Is Ana here? You know Justin Timberlake? Mmhm. Oh, my God! George Clooney asked me to show him around Beijing. I do a lot of business there, so I'm a great tour guide. Ok, wait a minute. You know George Clooney? [Laughs] We almost died together in the Sudan. We were in one of those dinky little planes and we hit a windstorm. [Laughs] You haven't lived until George has passed out in your lap. Nice. Why are you lying to me right now? [Laughing] Your mom knows famous people, too. We had dinner with Clinton in Angkor Wat. Remember? Clinton. Really? Don't get too excited. It was Bill, not Hillary. [Laughing] Hey, your mom and I traveled, too. Remember that night we spent in Barstow? How could I forget? My birthday weekend, greasy cheeseburgers, a roach infested motel, and a two dollar bottle prosecco. Only the best for you, my love. [Phone buzzes] Oh... Oh, Jesus wants to know if he can go to a movie with Lexi. Yeah, as long as he's home for curfew. Oh, I won't get to meet him? It's Friday night. And I'm the only single one in the house. That's not true. Brandon is single, too. I don't know about that. He just went to that concert tonight with Talya. So, that's back on? I guess so. What about you? Do you have a girlfriend? A few. I like to play the field. Although, I must say, your moms do make marriage look almost bearable. Well, they're not actually married. Really? You didn't do it when it was legal before? Stef, here, doesn't believe in gay marriage. That's not true. I believe marriage is a state of mind, not a matter of state. But you were married to Mike. Look how that turned out. [Laughs] Because you're gay. We're domestic partners. That's the same thing. [Gretchen] Is it? Well, if it were, why all the fuss about marriage equality? No, that's just not that important to us. [Gretchen] It's important to Lena. Unless you've changed your mind since we were together. I'm going to go check on those cornish hens. Mariana, would you please set the table? [Phone beeps] [Jesus] You got Jesus. Talk to me. [Beeps] Hey, I know you're not with Lexi. You better not be at Ana's. Call me. Mm. Maybe not gourmet, but that was delicious. I never knew you could cook. Mm. So, people do change, obviously. I get the feeling that you haven't. Changed that much. [Mariana] Can I be excused? Sure, honey. I don't know... I used to say that I would never settle down, but lately I've been thinking if I met the right person... Well, that is a change. Lena broke up with me because I wouldn't marry her. That is not true. It wasn't even legal anywhere back then. But you wanted a wedding. You wanted a wedding? [Gretchen] Mm-hm. I broke up with you because you weren't monogamous. Yeah, there was that. And you slept with my best friend. And that. But, look, now, I'm willing to walk down the aisle and you're not. How did that happen? I don't need a piece of paper and a ceremony to prove our love and commitment. But you would like it. Sure. Really? Why is this the first I'm hearing of it? You made it clear that you never wanted to get married again. And I was under the impression it wasn't important to you. Look, I didn't mean to open a can of worms... Didn't you? You know, I have an early flight, maybe I should go. Ok... Well, thank you for dinner. And it was great to meet you. Nice meeting you. I'll walk you out. [Jesus] ... Talk to me. [Beeps] Ok, now I'm totally freaking out. Why aren't you calling me back or answering my texts? I'm starting to think something bad happened to you. I don't care if you're at Ana's. Just call me. Well, that was awkward. No one asked her to leave. We didn't ask her to stay. Ten years together. How is it I didn't know you want to be married. Look, it's like you said. For all intents and purposes, we are married. But you want a wedding and the whole thing... Lena, it's embarrassing that I didn't know that. I assumed you did. So, all these years, you've been expecting me to propose to you? Were you expecting some flash mob or something? Don't be an ass. Don't tell me how to react. Can I talk to you? Can it wait, Mariana? No. Um... so, I got in contact with our birth mom. With Ana. Yes? And, um... she's living in town, in a crackhouse or something. And... I'm pretty sure Jesus is there with her now. I'm so sorry. What are you doing? Going to get our son. Can you get the address from Mariana, please? Stef, wait. Don't you think we should call the police? What do you think I am? Anyway, technically, she hasn't committed a crime, so... I'm just going to go get Jesus and leave. So don't worry. Mariana, I need the address of that house, please. [Low-tempo music] You came. Yeah, but on one condition. This is a date, ok? Ok. Or else I'm going back to my non-existent "thing" like, right now. I said, ok. Next time, I pick the movie. [Whispers] Deal. [Callie] What do you think they're saying? Why is he giving her so much shampoo? Oh, my dear. You have to get out of bed, your hair is a mess. [Laughs] No, no, no. You must take this back and take this back... What's at the bottom of your bag? Is it a badger? [Laughing] Badger? Yes, that's my pet badger. I think it's very rude for you to talk about him like he's not here. [Giggles] [Wyatt] Here, let me put him away... before he gets his feelings hurt. You taste like badger, George. Something you want to tell me? [Brandon] Their harmonies are amazing. [Talya] I wonder what it's like, being married and working together. Romantic or exhausting. Probably both. Anyway... thanks. So, how's your music? Um... I finally started taking lessons from Henry Marshall. What? Oh, my God. That's amazing. I mean, it's not that big of a deal. Yes, it is. You were totally crushed when he didn't pick you last year. Yeah... How is it? The lessons, I mean. Uh, fine. I guess. I mean, he's not exactly the warmest dude I've ever met. They never are. Yeah. I don't know if I'm going to stay with him. Brandon, you have to. It's what you dreamed of. Yeah, the lessons are really expensive. It puts a lot of pressure on my dad. You'll be fine. I don't think Marshall thinks it will. He says I need to "face my pain." [Laughing] Right? I don't even think I've ever had the kind of pain he's talking about. Do you want to grab a coffee? I'd like that. Ok. Lena called. Thought you might need some backup. [Dog barking] Anybody home? Police. Jesus? [Stef] Drugs... [Barking] [Gun shots] [Dogs barking] [Police sirens]
