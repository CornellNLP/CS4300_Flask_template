 Previously on The Fosters... 
 What about Lexi? 
 She's in Honduras. 
 But I don't do cheating. 
 Maybe we shouldn't go with an anonymous sperm donor. 
 Maybe we should ask Timothy. 
 [knocking] If you're interested in using me as a sperm donor, I'm in. 
 - I kept the money. 
 I owe it to my dad. 
 I used it for something else. 
 You're concerned about my sobriety. I know I saw you. 
 [Brandon] It was a one time thing. 
 It was for me, too. 
 It won't ever happen again. Kids with ADHD, it actually helps them to focus. I don't wanna take this stuff. If I can get off of it... What about getting into a contact sport? Someone got into the administrative office last night. And a number of Kindle Paperwhites are now missing. You didn't give my keys to anyone, did you? No. You didn't come by school last night, did you? No, I was at the house having dinner. Why? Daphne said she saw you. [Brandon] When you were in the office last night, making the IDs,  did you steal some stuff, too? So what? Whatever you took, put it back. What's that? It's Brandon's car. He was there last night. [knocking] Morning. How did you sleep? Ok. Did you make a list of everyone who was there at your photo shoot? Yeah. Are you going to tell Principal Sanchez about Daphne? I think I have to, honey. She's trying to get her daughter back. Well, we have to file a police report for the insurance. She's almost eighteen. They could send her to prison. There were other people there. Not people who had keys to the office. I shouldn't have told you. Honey, if Daphne didn't take anything then she's got nothing to worry about. I know it was really hard but you did the right thing. Ok? [exhales] [Stef] Jesus, breakfast! Let's go! [sighs] [exhales] Seriously, we're out of milk? [Lexi] Guess I drank it all. [all] Surprise! You're back? Are you surprised?! Are you kidding? Oh, I missed you so much. Me, too. ♪ It's not where you come from ♪ 
♪ It's where you belong ♪ 
♪ Nothing I would trade ♪ 
♪ I wouldn't have it any other way ♪ 
♪ You're surrounded by love ♪ 
♪ And you're wanted ♪ 
♪ So never feel alone ♪ 
♪ You're at home with me ♪ 
♪ Right where you belong ♪ You should've seen your face, Jesus, totally priceless. No one tipped you off? No. I can honestly say I was blind-sided by this one. [chuckles] So, how long are you here? For a week. Isn't that great? Great! But no closed doors in this house. She's staying in Mariana's room. We promised Lexi's parents, there will be no... funny business. I know what funny business is. Hey, you be careful, young man. Lexi, these pictures are really beautiful. I had no idea Honduras was so... Tropical? You live in, like, paradise. I know, right? I move over 2,000 miles away and I'm still going to school by the beach. Oh, speaking of school, we gotta roll you guys. Oh, yeah. Like now. Let's go. You're coming with us? I thought I'd surprise some of my girls. When I'm not spending every free second I have with you, that is. [chuckles] Oh, Lexi! You forgot your phone, sweetheart. I'll take it to her. Thanks, Jesus. Hey you, plenty of time for photos later. Sorry, just wanted to see for myself. Well, maybe we'll just take a few of our own then. Say... tonight? By the way, where's Brandon? Hot, hot. Ow! You know, I'm sure Dad has a spatula somewhere for that. Spatulas are for wusses. I hope you like French Toast. I do, but I'm actually running late. So, thanks. Brandon. Yeah. I don't want things to be weird between us. Yeah, no, I mean... [exhales] We both made mistakes. We're gonna fix it, right? Right. Which means you gotta get rid of that fake ID I'm not going to tell your dad, but if you got caught using it you can get in a lot of trouble. I'm not going to use it again. I'm getting rid of it. Good. Good morning, son. Goodbye, Father. Good talkin' to ya. He's late. What do we have here? Breakfast. I don't like you and Brandon having cereal every morning. And with you working nights, I thought I'd at least get one good meal in him today. I know. I've been trying to get back to days, but no luck. Well, until you do, Brandon's gonna keep coming home to an empty house, and, uh... I worry. What? That he's not eating right? And other things. Other things? Like what? I don't know, getting in trouble? Brandon's never been in trouble. I mean, other than this Callie business... Besides, it's temporary, him being here. Are you sure? I mean, do you really think he's gonna be able to live under the same roof as Callie? [exhales] I dunno. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd love to have him here long term, but he's so used to a full house. What if I moved in? [laughs] Wouldn't be a full house, but at least it wouldn't be empty. Don't you think it's a little soon? Come on, Mike, we're not kids. We know when it's right. And this is right. Why wait? Why not, ya know... lean in? [indistinct chatter] Hey, I need to talk to you. Are you ok? Did you... break up with Lexi? No. I tried, I did, but I couldn't because... [girls laughing] She's here. [Jesus] I had no idea she was coming back. Bye. Hey. You're Emma. We met online. Yeah, I crashed your "Jesus time." My what? [chuckles] She's just joking. Lexi's staying with us for a whole week! I totally surprised him. You should have seen his face. I would have loved to. Well, since you're here, we'll see you at the meet later. Oh, to watch me ride the bench? You don't need to do that. I wanna be wherever you are today, silly. Yeah... silly. Ahhhh!! Oh, my God! Ow! You need to see the nurse. I'm fine. No, you're really not fine. I'll see you at lunch. Should I be worried? Not at all. She's totally in the friend-zone. Trust me, I've been all over that. If anything was going on, I'd know. Zac. This is Lexi. Best friend. Meet my best new friend. Only new friend. Hey! [chuckles] Well, it's nice to finally meet you. She talks about you all the time. Yeah, you too. Really? Well, I'm glad to know someone else on Team Mariana. Again, it's a team of one, so we could use a few more bodies. Ok, you can not be friends with that guy. What? Why not? You don't like him? I mean, he's adorable, but he's not your friend. He's your crush. Oh, right. He was into me for awhile but... No, you're into him. What? Girl, you like, like him. I have never thought about him that way. Ok, well, your mind better catch up with your body because your body kinda wants to have his babies right now. You have s*x on the brain. I didn't fly across the world to have another video chat. Ok? [scoffs] [Brandon] Did you do it? Relax. The Kindles are back, ok? And you'll have your 900 bucks this afternoon. So chill. I can't believe you stole them in the first place. What an idiot move. You know what's an idiot move? Making this a one time thing. All I'm sayin' is after you pay back your dad, you could make some real bank for yourself. Money equals freedom, bro. Think about it. Yeah, well, I don't need to. I'm done. I've gotta take this. Whoa, slow your roll, tiger. Thanks. Didn't know you could read. I like the pictures. What can I do for you? I want in. On what? You know what I'm talking about. Really? I just assumed a girl like you already had a fake. Fake ID? Hey, no judgment. It's just, you know, you are juvie girl. Well, I don't have one. I'll need a photo. Ok. Stand over here, by the wall. So, where do you make them? The IDs? Afraid that's classified information. [chuckles] Here at school? Say, happy-hour! What's going on? Oh, nothing bad, honey. We... Stef came by for lunch and we thought this might be a good time to talk to you two alone. Uh, so, it's about the adoption. But before we start I wanted to let you know that the Kindles were returned last night. They were? Yes. So we don't need to talk to Principal Sanchez about... anything. So, anyway, as you know we've started the adoption process, but before we can petition the court we... we have to ask permission from your father. What does that mean? He has to sign away his parental rights. Why does he have any rights? He hasn't written us or tried to contact us in years. Well, legally, he's still your biological parent. Could he say no? He won't. What if he does? Then, we will petition the court to take away his rights, but hopefully that won't be necessary. We just need to know from you guys if it's all right if we ask him to let us be your parents. It's fine. Do you have to ask him in person? No, no, the lawyer will do that. In jail? He's not in jail... prison anymore. After I ran away, I tried to call him. And they said he got out a year ago. Why didn't you tell me? Because, obviously, he doesn't care about us anymore and... And you were trying to protect me again? Can I go eat lunch? Sure. Jude. Honey. You've had time to process this. He just needs some, too. [door opens, shuts] That is why I want to go with an anonymous donor. Well, what if Timothy would agree to be anonymous? There are contracts. We don't even know if Timothy is interested. Or do we? He, uh... he mentioned it, after that dinner. That's great. Tell you what, why don't you give me a ring when the baby is born and I'll swing by the hospital and pick you up. Unless you already have a ride? Honey. I have to get to work. Stef! [exhales in haste] What, you don't trust your business partner? We're not business partners. We could be. We've already got ten new clients lined up ready to fork over twice what the first batch paid. If you don't do it, I'm going into business with my buddy at Coronado Springs. Just go for it. I'm out. Ok, but, I don't trust him as much as I trust you. Not my problem. It could be. Considering one of my new clients is her. Hey, man, I need your help. Hey, dude, have you seen Callie? Lexi's here. I thought she was back in Honduras. So did I. And I kissed Emma, and I liked it. And I was going to break up with Lexi, but now I'm not sure. And Lexi totally wants to have s*x, like, tonight... Yeah, that's fine. My dad's at work, I'm not home 'til after six. Just don't do it on my bed. A fake ID? Really? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't lie to me. Wow! That is rich coming from you. What? I know you were at school the night of my photo shoot. And now I know why you were here. Making fake IDs in the office. Look... I didn't want to get you involved. Did you steal the e-readers, too? Vico did. I didn't know anything. I accused Daphne of taking them! I made him bring 'em back. Too late. I told Stef and Lena, and now they think she did it. I'm sorry. I lost a friend because of you. What am I supposed to do? Why are you selling fake IDs? I needed the money. What for? I can't tell you that. I'm sorry. No, I am. I don't even know who you are anymore. 
 
 Hey, did you get my text? Yup, emojis and all. I had no idea you had such school spirit. Yeah, well, it's my brother's first time competing. Um, I kinda got a little carried away. But, can you come? Lexi and I are gonna make giant cards that spell out his name, and we need you to hold one. I'm supposed to go straight home after school. Please, he needs all the support he can get. Emma broke her finger, and now he's gotta wrestle. And, um... after I was thinking maybe we could all go out. You, me, Lexi, Jesus. Just four people. Hangin' out. In a totally non-weird way. Yeah, so I just got this in today. It looks totally legit, right? Hey. I need to talk to you. Vigo sent me. Yeah, it sucks, but I guess one of the fakes got confiscated last night at a bar. Bouncer called the kid's parents and everything so we're gonna need to get 'em back. Seriously? Yeah, they're totally a bust. But, uh, don't worry I'll get you your money back. Here you go. No, spread the word, ok? We don't want anyone else getting caught, right? All right, let's count it out... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... [indistinct chatter] Don't worry, you're not wrestling that guy. Whew, thank God. You... are wrestling him. [Jesus] The human pretzel? He's slippery, but you can take him. I'm sorry about... Yeah, whatcha gonna do? But hey, big day, your first time competing. How do you feel? Nauseous. Eh... Listen, about Lexi... Lexi who? Out here, I'm not a girl. Remember? I was gonna break up with her, but... But what? She came all the way from Honduras. Maybe that's a good thing. I mean, if it were me, I'd rather be broken up with in person. Who are you texting? Oh. Um... Daphne. _ Telling her that the Kindles were returned. She didn't take them. Don't you think it's a little suspicious, honey? That you confronted her and the very next day they reappeared? Our concern is that you're in a vulnerable position. We all are. The court was hesitant to let you come home so soon. And we... we're all on probation. Principal Sanchez has to fill out your progress reports at school, and we can't control the way she perceives certain things. Like the company you keep. What are you saying? I can't be friends with Daphne and Kiara? No, of course you can, just at a distance for now. At least until your adoption goes through and we're your legal parents. So I have to make nice with the privileged kids because they're the right kind of company. Even though they're probably the ones who stole the stuff. We understand this is confusing, Callie... No, I'm not confused. This is exactly how the system works. Can I go sit with Mariana? Callie... Sure, honey. She's not wrong. No. But neither are we. Hey. Hey! Hi. Hey. Oh, my God, I can't wait to see his butt in that little leotard. Ok, A: it's called a singlet. And B: may have just thrown up a little bit in my mouth. Nervous? A little bit. Good. Harness that energy, and focus. Focus is key. Got it? I got it. All right. [grunting] Come on... Come on! Get up! Ok, so there's an escape, that's one point, a reversal, which is worth two, and then there's something called a near fall, which varies points-wise, and as far as I can tell, kinda just looks like sitting on someone's head. So, basically, we still have no idea how the scoring works. Yeah, not a clue. [whistle blows] [referee indistinct] _ _ [grunts] [whistle blows] [referee] Two points! _ Hey, am I too late? No, thank God. Here you go. What is it? A "J." Sit next to Callie. Ok. Ok, so everybody has their cards, so when it's Jesus's turn we're all gonna hold them up. Ok? [referee blows whistle] Take down! Oh! Should we be worried? Why am I suddenly worried? Because our son's about to go into mortal combat. Did we make a mistake, letting him do this? [Stef] No, it's been good for him. He was just so jumpy this morning. Was he? Yeah, I mean... He would come to us, right? If he wanted to get back on his medication. There's no shame in that. Not for us. But... for him? He has a... certain charisma. He's really popular with the students. He's certainly attractive. He's a Rhodes Scholar. Scholar, I remember that. And he's an animal lover, too. He also published a novel when he was 29, and he plays the sitar. What is that? It's like an Indian guitar, or something. Honestly, I have no idea what it is. But it's really cool, don't you think? And he's kind? Very. [whistle] [man indistinct] [man 2] And... takes the match. Alright, Jesus, you're up. All you gotta do is keep Palomar off the board and we've got this. The board? Scoreboard, Foster. I just put us in the lead. So don't blow it. Just stay off your back and you'll be fine. [crowd cheering] [whistle blows] Go get 'em, Jesus. Ok, now! Ready? [all] Whoo! [all] Jesus! [grunts] [whistle blows] What's he doing out there? Come on, focus up, Foster, we're running out of time. [crowd goes silent] [crowd cheering] First period: no points. [voice echoing] Hey, kid. You ok? You hurt? Hey, coach? We'll take an injury time-out. Foster, what gives? You good? [exhales] Listen to me, you gotta make a choice, you gotta make it now. It's win or lose. It's up to you, Foster. So what do you want? [all chanting] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus... Whoo! [crowd cheering] Let's go get 'em. [all chanting] Jesus, Jesus... [whistle blows] One! Escape! Yes! [coach] Nice! [referee] Two points. That a boy! [all] Get out of there! [both grunting] [blows whistle] Pin! Yes! Match to Anchor Beach. [crowd cheering] Anchor Beach takes the meet, 27-20. _ _ What's wrong? Are you ok? Yeah. So, I wanted you to know, I bought back all the IDs. Well, as many as I could. And I destroyed them. Well, I'm glad to hear that. I stopped going to piano for a few weeks, but I kept my dad's money. And I need to pay it back. Why did you do that? For you. For your apartment. When you were going into independent living. I... wanted to make sure you had everything you needed. You shouldn't have done that. I would've done anything to help you. And I still will. Because you do know who I am. How exciting was that?! That was amazing! It was. Oh, my gosh. You were really great out there, Foster. Thanks, that means a lot. Listen, um... I know. You're not gonna break up with Lexi. I may be benched... [chuckles] but I'm not blind. I really like you. But I love Lexi. And I told her I'd wait. I get it. [cheering] [indistinct chatter] Let's go get the car, you guys, come on. I've, um... I've got somewhere we can be alone. Ok, see ya. Hey, wait. Why the rush? Sorry, I just... I gotta get home. Oh, ok. I just, I thought, you know... Maybe we could all... you know? Is this... are we, like, on a date? Well, no, I mean... unless you want it to be a date. What're you doing? Just... looking through my pockets, for panties. Oh, very funny. You know, forget it. Ok, so... Do you wanna go on a real date? One we both know we're on? Uh-huh. Zachary! Get in the car, right now. I... I gotta go. Who is that? My mom. Sorry. Now! You're telling people our IDs don't work? I changed my mind. Well, I didn't change mine! It's a felony, Vico. I did us both a favor. Oh, yeah? Well, now I'm gonna return the favor. What does that mean? Nobody screws me over. Uh, wait, wait. I think we need to talk. About what? I kissed someone. Back in Honduras. You... who? This... boy. I don't even know if it... it'll turn into anything, but I wanted you to know. So what does this mean? Maybe it's just too hard. You know? To wait. But I love you. I love you, too. But I really think we need to break up. Lexi, come on, you don't have to do this. What, I'm gonna stay here? I just broke up with your brother, Mariana. Ok, fine, but you don't have to go all the way to Honduras. I mean, we were supposed to have a whole week to... [voice breaking] I can't... I'm sorry. I just need to go home. Can I just ask... Is there really a boy in Honduras? There will be. [door opens] Oh, hey! Sorry to just barge in like this. Your dad gave me a key so I could get dinner started. Lasagna! Your favorite, right? That's really nice, um, but I kinda need to talk to my dad when he gets home. Alone. Ok... sounds serious. Anything you wanna tell me? I think you know you can trust me with a secret. Maybe I can help. I owe my dad 900 dollars. He hasn't mentioned that. Because he doesn't know. Hey. Why didn't you just ring the doorbell? I just... I can't stay long. Oh, well, based on your lack of emojis, I'm assuming it's something serious. Yeah... I, um... I just... I think that we should just be friends. Why? I just, I have a lot of commitments right now and... I just don't think... Is this because of your mom, or something? Was she mad? No! No, it doesn't have anything to do with her. It's me. I just... I don't have time for a girlfriend right now. So I'm... I'm sorry. Hey. How come it says "T.J.?" Dad's name is Donald. Those are grandpa's initials: Thomas Jacob. Did I ever meet him? When you were really little. He died pretty young though. Hey, um... I should have told you that Dad's out of prison. I'm sorry. I just thought, the more you know, the more it hurts. Yeah, well, not knowing sucks. We're better off without him. I know. Hey there. Everything ok? Yeah. We're ok. Good. So, listen, the adoption lawyer has found your father. Where? Not far from here, actually. North Park. Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights. That's good. But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first. Oh, we don't. I do. Jude... You don't have to. But I wanna see my dad. You're probably gonna ground me, or whatever. But I just wanted to tell you the truth. I'm glad you told me. So, what did you do with the money, since you didn't give it to Callie? Thanks. I'm sorry, Dad. I can't believe he did this. It's so not like him. Frankly, I'm surprised he hasn't acted out before now. What's that supposed mean? Imagine how he must have felt when Stef and Lena moved in the twins. He went from being an only child to having two instant siblings. And now they've done it again with and Callie and Jude. It's just another reason why he needs to be with us. Before he makes another bad decision. Should we be worried? About... Jude seeing his father? He just needs closure. I think it's a good thing. I think Callie could use some, too. You think she'll change her mind about seeing him? She's pretty angry. Am I crazy? Is this a trick question? To want to have a baby when we've got all these kids? All these kids... are gonna be off to college, hopefully, in a few years. The house is gonna seem awfully empty, I think. [sighs] If you want to use Timothy, I think we should... get together, all three of us, and talk about it. Really? Yeah, really. What time do we have to pick Callie up from group? About an hour. We've got time. Time for what... Mrs. Adams Foster? You look just like your mother.
