 [Callie] Previously on The Fosters... 
 [Wyatt] You look good. 
 How would you know? 
 [Dani] Well, if she starts seeing him again, you only have yourself to blame. You have to convince her it's not too late. We are trying to have a baby. And we have a donor. It's Timothy. We want all of you to be on board. - Really important to Mama. [Jesus] How about your car keys? [Emma] Jesus... [Jesus] He's drunk! Mind your own business. Let him go! He's not driving, ok? I am. Just stay away from me. Mom, are you ok? Let's go home. I'm sorry, do I know you? Zac, your son. [Man] Can you think of any reason someone would go through all this trouble  to make this fake ID and plant it in your purse? All I have to do is tell them you set her up because I bought back the IDs. What IDs? The kids we sold to aren't gonna talk. It's your word against mine. I know who did this. Oh yeah, who? It was me. Don't do this, Brandon. [Ana] Stefanie Foster? Your son gave me money to change my story to say that I wasn't there the night that your partner killed Evan. You're out of your mind. I want 10,000 dollars. Then you'll never see me again. [Mike] What? I gave the money to Ana so she'd change her story. I was... Wait, wait, wait. You bribed her? No, it wasn't... I just wanted her to... To lie? No, she was already lying. I just wanted to make sure Dad didn't go to prison or something. Does anyone know about this? No. No one? No one. Ok, you cannot tell anyone about this, Brandon. Not until we figure out what to do. Do you understand? Yeah, yes. I mean it, I'm serious. This could end up very badly if this gets out. Ok. I'm sorry. I was... really trying to help. Well, at least no one knows. Ana does. So? So, she came to me the other day and threatened to go to the DA with it, unless I give her money. You're kidding. Ten thousand. Why is this the first time I'm hearing about it? Because she said, "Your son gave me a bribe." And I just assumed it was Jesus. I asked him, he had no idea what I was talking about. It never occurred to me... It could be Brandon? So what are we going to do? You can't pay the woman, that's a crime. And what's to stop her from going to the DA anyway? Or coming back again and again and demanding more. We have to do something. Because if she goes to the DA with it, he'll think that you put Brandon up to it. They'll reopen the case and he'll use it against you. That freakin' woman, I could kill her. Hey, take it easy. Ok. So, how do we make this go away? Well, "we" are not going to do anything. You are going to stay as far away from that woman as possible. I will handle Ana, ok? Ok. I want Brandon to come home. * It's not where you come from * 
* It's where you belong * 
* Nothing I would trade * 
* I wouldn't have it any other way * 
* You're surrounded by love and you're wanted * 
* So never feel alone * 
* You're at home with me * 
* Right where you belong * [Mike] You didn't think I was gonna find out? No, Mike. I was worried about you. You have had such a hard time lately. And Brandon, he didn't want to upset you, ok? So I did a stupid thing. Yeah, you did. I did it to protect you. Protect me? From what? I was worried about your sobriety. Oh, come on. Give me a break. I don't need that kind of protection. Because of you, Stef is making him move back home. She can't do that. She can! She has custody. She can do whatever she wants. Get out. What? Get out! We're done! Please! You know what? No. You can get your stuff tomorrow. Get out of here. I've told Mike that Brandon is coming home. Do you think he's ready for that after what he did tonight? He's going to have to be. The whole confession was a lie anyway, Lena. The part about him setting up Callie was a lie, but the rest of it? I'm not so sure. Well, Callie and Jude are being adopted on Monday. So he's got to get over it. Now. Why was he selling fake IDs to begin with? I don't understand it. What could he possibly need that much money for? Good news is we didn't have to arrest him. What about school? What's Sanchez going to do? I gave her the names Brandon gave you. Maybe one of them will give up Vico. But I'm pretty sure that she's going to expel him. What happened to our son? [Lena] I don't know. Mariana. Good morning. Good morning, Mrs. Rogers. Hi... Hey, honey. I will let you two snugglebugs alone. Ok. She seems... ok today. Yeah. But last night... she didn't even know who you were. Does that happen a lot? I don't know. Sometimes. And sometimes she thinks you're your dad. Yeah. Look, Zac. She needs to get some help, she needs to see a doctor. You don't understand. What? She... she has Alzheimer's. She what? She's so young. It's called early onset or something. She's not even that bad yet. I mean, this is why I didn't want us to start dating. I just really need to take care of her right now. But who's going to take care of you? Look, besides, if she gets put into a home or something, they'll make me go live with my dad. So I'd have to leave you. And I really don't want to leave you. So I will get you the money. Meet me tomorrow at the diner on Alavera at three. You know it? But on one condition. Once I give it to you, you are out of our lives forever, ok? Ok. I mean it. I get you that 10,000 and I never want to see you again. [phone rings] Open the chest. [game beeps] Jude, you have a phone call. I do? Who is it? I don't know. Hello? It's a girl. Who do you think it is? Yeah. Ok... I have to ask my moms first. Who's Jude talking to on the phone? He looks all nervous and twitchy. I don't know. Some girl. Maybe you could give him some advice? Me? Advice on girls? Yeah, that's not a good idea. What do you mean? Smooth operator like you? Well, Emma seems to think I'm more of a jackass than a Jack of Hearts. She's not even talking to me. Why? I got up in Kyle's face at the dance. What? Well, you kind of have been a jerk lately. I know you hate it when I get all sisterly on you and I give you advice and stuff, and I know how much you really wanted to get off your meds, but I gotta tell you, I kind of want my brother back. Who was that? Maddie from school. Maddie? What did she want? Um... she just wanted to know if I wanted to go see a movie with her next week. She did? What did you say? I said I would ask my moms and let her know at school tomorrow. Do you want to go, like... do you like her? No. No. Not like that. No. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, no. Then is it ok if I ask her out? Um... Yeah. Sure. So, I talked to your mom. She's fine if you wanna go back tomorrow, so you can work on your audition and focus... Dad. I'm really sorry. For everything. Didn't think... No. No, you didn't. And I've never been so disappointed, Brandon. So you read the donor contract? I did, I did. And... I don't think I can sign it. I really thought I could do this, but when I actually read the contract, and saw it all laid out... I couldn't get past the idea that there would be this kid in the world that came from me, who I wouldn't get to love or hold or play with. I... I think it would just destroy me. I'm sorry. What if you're already pregnant? I know, I know that. That's why I stopped to get a blood test at Urgent Care on my way home. And? It's not instant, honey. It's going to take 24 hours. Ok, this is what I was worried about. Using a donor that we know. We should never have inseminated before he signed that contract. Are you saying this is my fault? Because you were the one who agreed that we should do it while I was ovulating. Yeah, because it was pretty obvious how much you wanted to do it. Ok. Let's just hope that... that you're not pregnant. Stef, if you don't... want me to have a baby, you need to say it. I don't want you to have a baby, Lena. Honey... [sighs] Hey. So we're getting adopted tomorrow, and after that, there's... no, you know, going back. Yeah, I know. Yeah and I just feel ever since I got here, I've been ruining your life. No, Callie, no. I don't want to do that. You're not. Really? Brandon, I want this. I want to be a part of this family more than I have ever wanted anything in my whole life. If there is one thing that can make me blow this all up, it's knowing that I'm hurting you. Am I? Hurting you? No. Are you sure? Yeah. [toilet flushing] Lena? Honey? You'll be happy to hear that I just got my period. Honey, I'm sorry. I am not happy, I'm sorry about what I said... I know how much you want this and I want you to have everything you wanted, but when I think about a baby, a little tiny helpless person, I get so overwhelmed. The kids are all having a rough time, one way or another, and every time they make a mistake, I feel like it's my fault. Like, I'm screwing this up, I'm screwing them up. They're just teenagers. They're just making teenage mistakes. Remember you asked me why Brandon needed all that money from the IDs? He used it to bribe Ana. Ana? Not the twins' Ana. So Mike wouldn't go to jail. And Ana, being the delightful person that she is, showed up and demanded 10,000 dollars from us or she would go to the DA. So, what are we gonna do? You're not gonna pay her. No, I'm not gonna pay her. I'm going to wear a wire and record her trying to extort a police officer. [door opens, closes] [Dani] Hello? Yeah? Brandon... Callie came by. Oh, no. What happened? She's over me. You poor thing. What are you doing? Isn't your audition tomorrow? Yeah. Well, I'm not going to let you blow it. It's time for bed. Sit. Take off your pants. Wow. Bossy. Where's your phone? In my pants. I want to set your alarm. So you can't hit snooze, ok? I don't want you missing this. I'm sorry... about everything. You know? My dad. It's ok. It's not your fault. [sighs] Sucks about Callie. You deserve better. Before you know it, you're going to find her, someone who appreciates just how kind and amazing and handsome and talented you are. [* slow pop ballad] * Why'd you turn away so fast? * 
* Why can't anything just last? * 
* Why? * 
* Because too much is never enough for me * _  [Mike] Brandon, it's me, Dad. I love you. I love you and I feel like I'm failing you as a dad and I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was mean today. I know I messed everything up and... ... and you're a good son and I'm sorry. [ringing] [Dani] Hi, this is Dani. You know what to do. [phone beeps] Uh, hey, it's Brandon. Sorry to bother you. It's... look, I know it's kind of weird that I'm calling. But I just got a message from my dad that he left last night, and he sounded super drunk, and he's not home yet and I'm kind of freaking out. Uh, have you seen him? If you hear from him, or anything, will you let me know? Thanks. 
 
 [school bell rings] So did you ask your moms? About the movie? Can you go? Um... Yeah. They said it was ok. Ok, cool. I thought you said you didn't like her. So I changed my mind. You only like her 'cause I said I do. No, that's not it. It doesn't matter. She doesn't like you. She likes me. Yeah, whatever. You know what? I don't think I can come to your adoption thing today since it's just for good friends and I'm obviously not a good friend. [violin playing] [phone vibrating] Brandon Foster. [piano plays] Hey. So, I talked to my moms. I'm going to go back on my meds. I know that wasn't an easy decision. So, are you still going out with that Kyle jerk? Why do you ask? Why do you think? No. Can we start over? [sighs] Hm. I don't know. Really? You're gonna be like that? How about we wrestle for it? Are you sure you want to take that chance? With your record? I always wins when it counts. Our folks are inside. Talking to Sanchez. This is all your fault, you know... Oh, yeah? It's my fault you set up Callie? I told you I was gonna hit you where it hurt. Well, nice. Now we're both gonna get kicked out of school. [sighs] Relax. Nobody's getting kicked out. Dude... we made fake IDs in the school machine. You brought booze to the winter dance. My parents are taking care of it. They're founding members of the charter, my mom's head of the parent board. She basically signs Sanchez's checks. [scoffs] I can't believe you're gonna get away with this. You think I'm getting away with this? My dad's a total b*st*rd. He's making me quit wrestling. So? So I was going to get scouted. I was going to get a scholarship. Finally get out from underneath his thumb. But not anymore. Life's crazy, you know? One minute, you're just cruising along... Next minute? Someone swoops in and kills your dream. Oh, hey, bubby. Painting them for the big day? Are you excited? You ok? When did you know you were gay? What do you mean? There's this... this girl at school, Maddie, and Connor wanted to go out with her, and I got all, kind of, jealous, I guess. Ok. That happens. But I don't think I'm jealous about Maddie. Oh, honey. That's... totally normal. Not normal, that's not what I mean. Let's not use the word normal at all. Honey, everybody gets jealous when their friend gets a boyfriend or girlfriend. Everybody. And it doesn't necessarily mean that you're gay or that you're not. And if you are or you're not, it really doesn't matter to us either way. We love you no matter what because you're you. I know. Ok. I'm going to go get changed. Ok. She was doing some ironing and came into my room. And she didn't know who I was. [sighs] She started screaming and I tried to get the iron out of her hands, and she, um... she hit me. I finally got her to watch some TV. You've got to do something about this. This... this is not ok. She's going to hurt you even worse or somebody else or herself. Uh, yeah, Linda? It's me, Zac. Is my dad there? Hey, Dad, it's me. I need some help. [sighs] Mom's really, really sick. [phone rings] - Hey. [Dani] I found him. He's fine. He is? Are you sure? Yeah, he's been drinking. He's going to need to sleep it off, but he's ok. Thank you for doing that. Don't worry. It's all good. Bye. [sighs] You haven't seen Ana, have you? She went out yesterday and never came back. One of the residents did mention that they saw her get in a screaming match with some guy. I just hope she's ok. Ok, thank you. [Dani] What happened? Were you in a fight? Hey, I'm here! This is so exciting. Hi, babies. All right, let's do this. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah. So, how'd it go with Sanchez? Gonna have to start looking for new schools for Brandon? No, thank God, but... But what? She's not expelling him. That's great, right? Of course, but she's also not going to do anything about Vico. There's something wrong with that kid. Really? Yeah, this is why this entire thing will go away. Because Sanchez is afraid of Vico's parents. It just makes me furious. [sighs] So, did you meet with Ana? Uh, no. She didn't show. She wasn't at the halfway house when I went there after. They said she never came home last night. So, now I'll have to wait till she shows up again. [sighing] Listen, are we ok? I... I said some things yesterday that I know hurt your feelings. I thought about what you said, and I think you're right. We've got all these beautiful kids and... they need us right now. Really? Really. Uh, it's just... I heard back from Urgent Care and... I didn't start my period. It was just spotting... because I'm pregnant. I thought when I heard those words I would feel... I don't know what I thought I'd feel but... I feel nothing but love right now, baby... [sobs] Love for you and for this beautiful baby we're going to have. Oh, my God... Oh, baby. I'm so happy. You ok? Yeah, it's just... it looks like Zac is going to have to move in with his dad for awhile. Oh, yeah? In Arizona. Oh. That sucks. It's ok. I just want him to be safe. Yeah, of course you do. But you finally get a boyfriend and... And yeah. I just... I feel like everyone I love ends up leaving. Hey... That's not true. Hey. You didn't have to come. Are you kidding me? And look who I found outside. What? Hi! Damn girl, it's adoption day! We're so happy for you and I'm so proud of you. Hey. Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah. Sure. Over here. [Connor] Hey. Hey, you got my message? I wasn't sure you'd come. Well, it's for family and friends, right? Um, I'm sorry about the whole Maddie thing. If you like her... No, I don't know. Maybe all three of us can go see a movie sometime? Hey, Connor. Hey, Callie. I can't believe this is about to happen. We're about to get adopted. Hey, guys. Hey Connor, how are you? Hey. Can we talk to you for a sec? Yeah. So, there's... there's a problem with the adoption, with Callie's paperwork. What? What is it? The court needed your original birth certificate. There were only duplicates in your foster care file. And when they got yours... there was a different name listed for father. So, Donald isn't my dad? Not according to the birth certificate... It says, Robert Quinn? Does that name mean anything to you? Um... well, Quinn is my middle name. But Mom told me it was a family name, so... What does this mean? We don't... really know. [Stef] We'll talk to Donald. See what he knows. We'll figure something out, I promise. Ok? But until then... I'm not getting adopted. Not today, but you are getting adopted, Callie. We promise. Well, I'm not getting adopted without you. No, Jude. We have waited too long for this day, ok? I'm not going to let you do this. But... No, it's ok. It's ok. Hey, I'm ok, all right? Today is your day. And you are going to walk into that courtroom and officially, officially, officially become a member of this family, ok? Ok. Ok? Ok. Ok. Ok. [Callie sniffles] Yeah. Here we go, ok? I'm just going to step out and get some air. Callie... I'll be back in a minute. [Brandon] What happened? It's a really good thing. What did you wear? I love your dress. Oh, thank you. Callie? Hey! Hey! Callie? What's going on? What happened in there? What? I, um... I can't get adopted. Apparently, there's something wrong with my birth certificate. I feel like... nothing... nothing ever works out, you know? Like the whole freakin' universe is against me. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Cal. The universe isn't against anybody. I know it feels that way right now, but I'm telling you, that's not how it works. Life is a mixed bag. We all get some good and we all get some bad. The more time that you spend figuring out all the ways that the world is trying to screw with you? Well, the more you're going to find. Listen, this sucks. I know. Big time. And I don't know how this is going to end. I don't know how this is gonna play out. But I know you. I know when it gets hard that you want to run. But I'm telling you, you got to fight that. Sometimes you've got to stick around long enough for your luck to find you. [sighs] [* slow ballad] * Out of the rubble * 
* Black from the flame * 
* I know your heart is dying for rain * 
* All of the whispers * 
* Still on your breath * 
* Got you saying again "This is good as it gets" * 
* Love, it's gonna find you * 
* Oh, love, is not gonna * 
* Leave you laying alone * 
* Forever * 
* Your mind is your greatest arch enemy * 
* It won't let you forget * 
* It won't let you sleep * 
* Clear as a teardrop * 
* You see the past * 
* You know what you know but there's no looking back * 
* Love, it's gonna find you * [indistinct chatter] It's still true, you know. Yeah. I'm ok. Promise. I don't know what you're talking about. [indistinct chatter] [playing down-tempo song] Think I'm gonna go get my stuff from my dad's. We haven't even cut the cake. No, I'll have some later. Just want to get it done, you know? Ok. You're getting really good. I've been practicing. Maybe we can jam a little when I get back home. Yeah, I'd like that. Wait, Brandon, I forgot. What happened with the audition for the symphony? Oh... I got it. You did? Yeah. That's amazing. Thanks. Ok. I need to know something. If you can't or if you're not going to be able to get adopted, does that change anything? About Brandon? No. No, it doesn't change anything. Play me something. Ok. [* down-tempo] [indistinct chatter]
