 Face au destin 
(2x06 : As Fate Would Have It) 
 Written by CRAIG SWEENEY 
Directed by NICK GOMEZ 
 **Previously on The 4400** 
 Inside Maia's diary are written the words 'Things I see'. 
 Diana: You know those visions that Maia used to have? Turns out she was only pretending that they stopped. 
 Tom: How long have you known? 
 Diana: Not long. I only found out because I read. 
 Liv and Shawn under the bridge. 
 Liv: You're one of those 4400 guys, right? 
 Collier's office. 
 Collier: One day, all of this will be yours. 
 Shawn: But you're not going anywhere. 
 Collier: Whatever you do Shawn, don't reveal your healing ability, because if you heal one of them, you'll have to heal them all. 
 Shawn heals Dewie . 
 On campus 
 Wendy: If you're losing chunks of time you should talk to your Dad about it. 
 Kyle: What's he gonna do? Turn me over to NTAC medical? 
 Lily first turns up on her doorstep. Heidi answers the door. 
 Heidi: Can I help you? 
 Lily: Heidi, it's Mommy. 
 Heidi: Who? 
 Brian: That's ok sweetheart, I got it. 
 Lily and Brian have dinner. 
 Lily: She's my daughter. 
 Brian: She doesn't know that. She thinks that Carole is her mother. 
 Richard is sitting in a cell and Lily phones Brian. 
 Lily: I need your help. Richard. He's been arrested. 
 Brian: OK, I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can. 
 Collier turns up in Richards cell. 
 Collier: Hello Richard. 
 They talk. 
 Collier: I want you to come home. If I'm wrong, Isabelle will punish me accordingly. 
 Flashbacks to the men pursuing Richard and Lily in the woods and killing themselves. 
 Collier: If Isabelle accepts me, well then I can offer you and Lily and the child a new life. Let her judge me. 
 Collier meets with Isabelle. 
 **Present time** 
 The 4400 Center 
 Banners are being erected on a stage saying 'Welcome 4400. Reunion Weekend 2005' In the background Collier can be heard singing gently. 
 Collier: Hush a bye Go to sleep little baby. When you wake I'll give you cake and all the pretty little horses. 
 Collier is kneeling in front of Isabelle's pram. 
 Collier: And go to sleep little baby. And who's a special girl? Is Isabelle a special baby, is she? Come here. 
 Richard and Lily watch from inside. 
 Lily: Look at him with Isabelle. 
 Richard: If this keeps up, we're gonna have to start calling him Uncle Jordan. 
 Lily: There's something so wrong about that, isn't there? A week ago, he was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her and now it's like.... 
 Richard: They've bonded. She's really taken to him. 
 Shawn comes into the room laughing. 
 Shawn: The couple of the hour! Hi! Richard, what's up man? 
 They hug. 
 Shawn: It's good to see you. 
 Richard: Nice to see you. 
 He looks at Lily and whistles. 
 Shawn: Look at you! 
 Lily: Ah! 
 Shawn: You look great! 
 They all take a seat. 
 Shawn: So how long you guys think you're gonna be staying? 
 Richard: We're not sure. Collier said we can stay at the center until we get back on our feet. 
 Shawn: Did he get you squared away with NTAC? 
 Richard: He's started to. His lawyers took our statements. I guess we're looking at back fines for not reporting in. 
 Shawn: Well hey, I'm sure Jordan will take care of it. 
 Lily: He offered to, but I think we're gonna try and swing it ourselves. 
 Shawn: Well hey, you picked the right week to come. 
 Richard: This reunion thing's gonna be big, huh? 
 Shawn: We've got 4400's coming in from 27 different countries. Three more maybe's. There haven't been this many of us in the same place since quarantine. 
 Lily: What's happened since we left town. I mean, suddenly it seems that everyone's dying to meet a real life 4400. 
 Shawn: Uh well, what happened? Jordan happened. 
 They look out at him and see him holding the baby. 
 Collier: Welcome to the revolution little lady. Huh? Yeah. 
 Maia runs out of her bedroom screaming. 
 Maia: Aagghh! He's gonna die. I saw it! He's gonna die! 
 Diana and April run out. Diana throws her arms around her. Maia is sobbing. 
 Diana: Sweetheart. Are you ok? Did you have a nightmare? 
 Maia: No! I was awake, and I saw it! 
 Diana: Tell us what you saw. 
 Maia: That man we watched on TV once. 
 April: What man? 
 She points to Colliers book. 
 Maia: Him. 
 Diana: Jordan Collier? 
 Maia: Someone's gonna kill him! 
 She puts her arms around Diana, sobbing. 
 Titles 
 Diana reports to Nina Jarvis. 
 Nina:As far as this department knew, Maia wasn't having visions anymore. Right? 
 Diana: Well she was keeping them secret from me and writing everything down in a diary. But I'm not here to talk about my daughter. We're here to talk about Collier. 
 Marco: We can talk about him all you want, but if I was Collier I'd be bringing all my books back to the library, if you know what I mean. The kid's never wrong, right? 
 Diana: Look, as far as I can tell, Maia has two kinds of visions. If she can see an event clearly enough in her head, she can sometimes influence the course of the future. But mostly her visions are abstract. They're more like....certainties. Prophecies I guess you could call them. Now this is one of those, and as far as I can tell, they're never wrong. 
 Tom: Well not yet, anyway. But nobody's made a concerted effort to stop one of them from happening. 
 Diana: So we could always offer Collier a suite in the basement, 24 hours surveillance and a food taster. 
 Nina: Yeah sure. We just tell the guy he needs to stay isolated for what, a week? A year? 
 Marco: When it comes to the prevention of future crime, there are no time limits and everyone's a suspect. I mean, literally everyone. 
 Nina: So how to stop the inevitable from happening. 
 Tom: Stopping the inevitable? Isn't that what we deal with everyday? I mean, that's why the 4400 were sent back, right? 
 Marco: I like the can do attitude but, I have to ask, do we even want to save Colllier. 
 Diana laughs. 
 Marco: Well he is kind of a bad guy. 
 Nina: Maybe that's the way the future wants it. 
 Tom: Nice. They gave us this message as a way to stop Collier's death. 
 Tom and Diana go to see Collier at the center. 
 Collier: Fascinating. What an extraordinary gift. 
 Tom: You are clear in what we're telling you? 
 Collier: Your daughter has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future. Her latest vision involves my death. I leave anything out? 
 Diana: No, that about covers it. 
 Tom: NTAC is offering you all it's resources. That means round the clock protection, threat assessment.... 
 Collier: And I'm mean't of course, to isolate myself. 
 Diana: Well, that would be the safest move. 
 Collier: Let's say I'm willing to assume good faith on your part, which given your exploitation, of the 4400 to get to me, is rather generous. 
 Diana: What, you actually think we made this up? 
 Collier: I'm not sure you're that creative, but your plan does call for my total withdrawal from the public eye. And cancellation of the celebration of the public interest in the 4400, that's been months in the planning. 
 Tom: Our history with each other is what it is, but this is real and denial is not a luxury you can afford. 
 Collier: Thankyou for the information, I'll keep it in mind. 
 Tom and Diana stand up. 
 Diana: Maia is never wrong. 
 Collier: Whatever protection you can afford me, I can afford myself. Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out. The foreign returnee stories are particularly inspirational. 
 They leave 
 Brian is standing in a store selling fruit and vegetables. Lily walks up to him. 
 Lily: Still come here every thursday huh? Thought I might get lucky. 
 Brian: Lily, what are you doing here? 
 Lily: I'm back....in Seattle. I just wanted to thank you for helping Richard. 
 Brian: Just a couple of phone calls. No big deal. 
 Lily: We were in a bad spot. You did what you could. It really mean't a lot. 
 Lily is holding a gift bag. 
 Brian: Well you really didn't have to get me.... 
 Lily: It's actually for Heidi. Her birthday's coming up. 
 Brian: Oh, Lily. 
 Lily: It's just a cool little handbag. You don't have to tell her it's from me. 
 He takes the bag. 
 Lily: I don't wanna mess with your life, Brian. I'm just trying to say thankyou. 
 Brian: Ok. You're looking well though. I'm glad things are working out. 
 Shawn is walking through the center with Lucy. 
 Shawn: I can't talk to first keys today. There's too much going on with this party. 
 Lucy: Look, class starts in ten minutes. 
 Shawn: I can't do it, Lucy. You're just gonna have to tell them to think of it as a study hall. 
 Liv and Wayne enter the foyer. Wayne appears to be ill and is coughing. 
 Shawn hands over some letters to the man on the desk. 
 Shawn: Um, this is outgoing. Thank you. 
 He walks over to them. 
 Shawn: Ah, Liv! 
 Liv: They were too embarrassed to come inside. 
 Shawn: I can't. I can't! 
 Liv: I saw what you can do. 
 Wayne: We all did! 
 Liv: You can heal people. 
 Shawn: Listen, it's not that simple. I can't heal everyone! 
 Liv: I'm not asking you to heal everyone. Just them. 
 Shawn: You don't understand. It's like it drains me. I could do it for maybe one, maybe. 
 Wayne: One is better than none! 
 Shawn: Who chooses that one, Wayne? You? Me? I can't heal the world. I'm sorry. 
 Wayne: What I tell you? Waste of time. 
 Liv remains looking at Shawn. 
 Shawn: Don't look at me like that. 
 They run out . 
 Kyle and Danny are on campus. Kyle is reading some posters while Danny clicks his fingers in front of his face. 
 Danny: Kyle. Hey, you with us buddy? 
 Kyle: What? 
 Danny: Thought you were uh, elsewhere. 
 Kyle: No, I'm right here with you. I was just thinking....Relax, I haven't had one of those blackouts in a couple of day's. I think that's all done. 
 Danny: Yeah, I do too. I still think you should tell your Dad about it and get yourself checked out. 
 Kyle: You wanna go with me to see the Kills? 
 He's looking at a poster that say's: Performing at the campus pub. 8pm The Kills. 
 Danny: Ok, so we're ignoring the whole blackout thing or... 
 Kyle: Pretty much. They go on at eight. You should come. 
 NTAC 
 Tom and Diana are in their office. 
 Tom: TSA is putting a flag on Ian Dravitt and his known associates. They're gonna call us if anyone show's up in Seattle. 
 Diana: This whole Dravitt thing is just Collier's latest deal gone south. 
 Tom: Collier had his name on the side of a skyscraper by the time he was 30. You pursue power that ruthlessly, you pick up some enemies along the way. 
 Diana: So we find the one who seem's most like John Hinkley or surhan surhan. 
 Tom: And then do what? Follow him around for the rest of his natural life? We could spend the next year looking at Collier's moves since he founded the center. The guy had a whole career before he got abducted. 
 Diana: Well maybe it is coming from someone who Collier's never met. I mean, if you hate The 4400, killing their figurehead is a good way to make them suffer. But, what are we supposed to do? The potential victim's refused our help. No-one said stopping the future was going to be easy. 
 Tom: Diana, look at this. 
 She get's up to take a look at his monitor. A mans photo appears along with some information. 
 'My name is Miles Quinlan. I was kicked out of the 4400 center after Jordan Collier bankrupted me by selling me lies and false promises. This blog is dedicated to exposing Jordan Collier as the liar and cheat that he most certainly is.' 
 Tom: His name is Miles Quinlan. He claims Collier bankrupted him, then kicked him out of the center 
 Diana: He lives with his parents. What? Nursing a persecution complex? 
 Tom: Pretty much the poster boy for the lone gunman theory. 
 April is watching Maia. 
 April: Come on Maia, I've named every guy I've dated for like, the last five years. Are you telling me that I don't have a future with any of them? 
 Maia: I wouldn't worry about it. Seem's like you meet a lot of boys. 
 April: Yeah well, that's the trouble. I'm tired of meeting boys. I wanna meet a man. 
 Maia: You will. 
 April: When?? 
 Maia: Aunt April. Just because I don't see it, doesn't mean it's not gonna happen. 
 There's a knock at the door. 
 April: Oh, that's probably Mrs Bradshaw from upstairs. She's gonna watch you tonight while I go to work. 
 Maia opens the door to find Collier standing outside. She drops her glass, which smashes on the floor. 
 Maia: I'm sorry. It's not my fault. 
 Collier: You recognise me. 
 She turns and runs. 
 April: You're Jordan Collier. 
 Collier: I didn't mean to frighten her. I just wanted to talk to her for a minute. 
 April: Yeah well, it doesn't look like that's gonna happen. 
 Collier: She believes I'm going to die. Please give her my apologies. I brought this for her. I hope she doesn't already have one. 
 He hands her a Sony PSP. 
 April: Thanks. 
 He leaves. 
 Lily walks to the center's foyer and approaches the man at the desk. 
 Lily: Hi, I'm Lily Tyler. I believe someone's asking for me? 
 Heidi is sitting on a chair. She stands. 
 Heidi: Excuse me. 
 Lily: Heidi. 
 Heidi: Are you my Mother? 
 They sit 
 Heidi: I heard them fighting about you. My Mom and Dad? Carol. It's ok if I still call her Mom, right? 
 Lily: I know, it's confusing, baby. 
 Heidi: Just because they're talking in the other room, doesn't mean I can't hear them. They said you were one of the 4400. 
 Lily nods 
 Lily: That's why I was gone. That's why we don't know each other. 
 Heidi: Didn't you come to our house once? 
 Lily: It's the first thing I did when I got back. I wanted to see you. But your Dad and I, we weren't sure it was a good idea. Sweetie, does your Father know you came down here? 
 Heidi: No. I didn't tell him I heard. I didn't go to school today. I came here instead. 
 Lily: I'm glad you did. 
 Heidi: Is it hard for you not to see me? 
 Lily: It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I think about you every single day. 
 She get's out her purse and shows a photo of Heidi inside. 
 Lily: Look at this. 
 Heidi: Is that me? 
 Lily: It's the day we brought you back from the hospital. 
 Heidi: You look the same as you do now. 
 Lily: I was gone so long, but to me, this feels like yesterday. 
 Lily hugs her. 
 Diana and Tom go to Quinlan's house. 
 Quinlan: You wanna talk about Collier? He uses people up and leaves them on the kerb. 
 Tom: Is that why you left the center? 
 Quinlan: I didn't leave, they threw me out. That's what happens when you run out of money. They have all these different levels. They call them keys, right? You make seventh key, you're unlocked. 
 Tom: Unlocked? Meaning you've got your own 4400 ability? 
 Quinlan: Well that's the big prize. Only they set it up so that no-one ever get's there. There's mid levels and side seminars you have to pass. If you're not one of the 4400, each one costs. First I ate up my savings, then I cashed out the equity in my house. 
 Tom: And they didn't deliver. 
 Quinlan: As soon as the first cheque bounced, they told me I'd reached maximum potential and sent me on my way. 
 Tom: Is that why you applied for a handgun permit? We ran a BCAP check on you this morning. 
 Quinlan: So I bought a gun, so what? I need to protect myself from Collier. 
 Tom: Yeah well, I hope that self defence is all you have in mind. Because if you're planning anything else, we will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center. You want something to be paranoid about? Think about that. 
 Shawn and Collier talk in his office. 
 Collier: You're simplifying the issue. Cancelling the gala is no guarantee of my safety. 
 Shawn: It's a start. Jordan, you just told me there's a little girl out there who can see the future and she saw you dead. It's time to make yourself scarce. 
 Collier: And where does it stop? I stay away from the center? I cut myself off from our work? 
 Shawn: Yeah, if it means staying alive, yeah! 
 Collier: I am not going to become a hermit! That is not a win for us! Look, the center is significantly safer than it seems. Half the people you see in workmate's uniforms are bodyguards. 
 Shawn: Are you looking to die in public? 
 Collier: You're developing a real flare for drama, you know that? This is hanging over my head, not yours! 
 Shawn: I'm sorry Jordan, I'm just.... 
 Collier: I am not ready to become a martyr. 
 Shawn: You don't have to be! I know you've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time. Bringing all the 4400 together is like a validation of everything you've done so far. But if something happens to you? It could undo everything we've started. The movements not ready for you to be a martyr either. 
 Collier: Just go. Go. 
 Richard is sitting by Isabelle in their room. Lily walks in. 
 Richard: Where did you go, I was about to page you. 
 Heidi is beside her. 
 Lily: Richard, there's someone who I want to introduce to you. This is my daughter, Heidi. She came to the center to meet me. We've been talking. 
 He walks over and shakes her hand. 
 Richard: Well, it's very nice to meet you. I'm Richard Tyler. I'm married to Lily. Your mother. 
 He laughs. 
 Heidi: She told me. It's nice to meet you too. Is that.... 
 Lily: Isabelle. This is your half sister. 
 As Lily moves closer to her, Isabelle begins to cry. 
 Heidi: Don't be scared. 
 Lily: I'm sorry. She must be hungry. 
 Heidi: It's ok. I should probably get home anyway. 
 Lily: I hope I can see you again. 
 Heidi: I hope so too. maybe next time I can hold Isabelle. 
 Lily: I know I can make that happen. I'll walk you out. No more cutting school, ok? 
 They leave the room. Isabelle is upset. 
 Richard: What's the matter? 
 Collier storms out. 
 Diana arrives home from work. April is cooking dinner. 
 April: All I'm saying is that he was taller than I pictured him. 
 Diana: Tall or short. Collier had no business showing up here! 
 April: I totally agree. Di, I didn't let him in! 
 Maia: Aunt April likes tall boys. 
 Diana: Ah. So, you're talking about men to my daughter? She's a child! 
 April: It might have come up in passing. 
 Maia: Hey Mom, how come you never go out on dates? 
 Diana: Well, I wouldn't say never. 
 Maia: But Aunt April goes out all the time. 
 Diana: Well I think your Aunt's an extreme example. 
 Maia: How do I know which one is right? Not many or lots? 
 Diana: I think that you should probably shoot for somewhere in the middle. 
 Maia: I'll try. But do dates always have to be with boys? So gross. 
 April and Diana laugh. 
 April: You get used to them. 
 Diana: Can we have this conversation like, in two or three, maybe ten, years? 
 A letter is lying on the table. 
 Diana: What's that? 
 Maia: Oh, a lady dropped it off today. 
 Diana: Oh. 
 She opens it. 
 Diana: It's a suppoeana. 
 Maia: What's that? 
 Diana: Oh, it's when someone wants you to give them something. 
 April: Who's it from? 
 Diana: It's from my bosses. 
 Maia: What do they want? 
 Diana: Your diary. 
 Later at the campus pub. 
 Kyle is in a corridor leaning his head against the wall. He seems unwell. 
 Danny: Kyle! You ok man? You didn't have a drink did you? 
 Kyle is having flashbacks of something, but its fleeting. 
 Kyle: Just diet coke. It's really loud in here, huh? 
 Danny: Yeah, but they're great, huh? You wanna go back in? Alright, come on. My buddy's saving us a spot by the stage. 
 Danny leaves and Kyle has more flashbacks of himself. He wakes up up on the floor and get's to his feet. As things clear it appears he's in the hallway outside Wendy's apartment. 
 Wendy: Do you know what time it is? What are you doing here? Kyle! Do you know what time it is? What are you doing outside my apartment? 
 Kyle: I don't know. I was at the pub. 
 Wendy: You're scaring me. How long have you been out here? 
 Kyle: I don't know. I think I was digging or something. 
 Wendy: Look Kyle, I think you should go. We can talk about this tomorrow. 
 Kyle: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. This won't happen again. 
 He stumbles out. 
 That night, Liv tries to get into the center. Guards grab her. 
 Shawn comes down the stairs. 
 Liv: Let me in! Let me in! Get your hands off of me! You don't understand. He's a fraud! All of you, do you hear me? Your golden boy is a big fraud!! 
 She's screaming and crying. 
 Shawn: Liv, you need to calm down. It's ok guys, I got it. 
 Liv: My whole life I have been looking for just one thing. Just one thing to believe in. I thought it was you. 
 She runs at him and begins to hit him, collapsing sobbing on the floor. 
 Shawn: How long ago did you get high? 
 Liv: I only had one. 
 Shawn: Are you going to stop yelling at me? 
 Liv: I am done with you, altogether! Go back to your penthouse! Pretend we don't exist! Everyone else does. Why not you? 
 Shawn: Easy. I'm not going to send you off into the night like this. You can sleep on my couch. I got you. It's ok. It's ok 
 He helps her up and they head to his room . 
 Lily and Richard are outside watching Collier spend some time with Isabelle. 
 Collier: You started all this, you know. Everything around you took shape after you showed me where to go. Yeah. I don't know what to do though. I could count the number of times I've said that in my life, on one hand. But right now it's true. That's right. If you knew anything, now would be a good time to tell Uncle Jordan, huh? 
 She grabs his hands and he's given a vision. He see's himself at the gala, walking through a crowd of people who are all happy to see him. He then see's many of the people at the centre receiving the seventh key. A portrait of him is unveiled. 
 Back to the present. 
 Collier: Oh. Thankyou. Thankyou. 
 He walks over to Lily, Richard and Shawn 
 Collier: The reunion goes forward. 
 Shawn shakes his head and Collier walks away. 
 Later, someone is in a darkened room. Only their hands are shown, which are gloved. They are assembling a gun. 
 Tom enters his office. Diana is already there. 
 Tom: Diana! One of Dravitt's hired guns flew into town last night. His name is Laurence Ganning. TSA have his alias flagged. 
 Diana: Well do we have a present whereabouts? 
 Tom: Just checked into a motel on First Hill under the name Laurence Gawain. 
 They burst into the motel room. 
 Agent: It's clear! 
 Diana: Tom 
 Diana has found a passport. Tom opens it. Date of birth 15th November 1967. Age 38. Address 320 Rue Saint Jacques, Paris. 
 Tom: He's on the move 
 
 
 
 Boxes are being taken into the center. Gawain is one of the men. 
 Kyle runs up to Wendy on campus. 
 Kyle: Wendy wait! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! 
 Wendy: You were waiting in the hallway outside my apartment last night. Do you know how weird that is? 
 Kyle: I don't know how I got there! Please believe me. I had another blackout last night. 
 Wendy: Look Kyle, this is getting bad and I can't give you the kind of help that you need. 
 Kyle: So you want me to just go away? 
 He starts backing away from her and she moves towards him. 
 Wendy: No I want you to talk to someone. Someone qualified. I'm scared for you. 
 Kyle: Scared for me or scared of me? 
 He runs away. 
 Collier is practising his opening speech on stage. Gawain is watching from backstage. He say's a few words that are unrecognisable due to mic feedback 
 Collier: You know what? I'm getting some nasty echo. Can we adjust the levels to the speakers at the back there? Testing, testing. You know what? That's lovely. 
 NTAC agents including Tom and Diana arrive outside the center. Collier begins to walk offstage as Gawain watches. He points the gun... 
 Diana: Nobody move! Everyone, stay right where you are! 
 Tom rushes backstage and see's Gawain. 
 Tom: Don't move! Don't move!! Get your hands on your head! Get them up! Turn around! Turn around!! Get down! Down! 
 Gawain get's to his knees. 
 Tom: Down! 
 Tom pushes him on his front. Collier stands and watches. 
 Later Tom briefs Collier. 
 Tom: Gawain's pistol was made from synthetic polymer's. The bullet's too. He walked right through your metal detector's without so much as a peep. 
 Collier: You were bound to get him. He never would have killed me. 
 Tom: He was standing two feet away from you with a loaded firearm. 
 Collier: The whole thing was put in motion by Maia. Your daughter's vision was a gift to me. A prescription, if you will, to changing the future. In one chain of events, Ganning's bullet killed me. I can only assume that somebody has a different plan for me. 
 Diana: Well I wouldn't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet. 
 Collier: I have no intention of cancelling the extra security measures. 
 Tom: The same extra measures that just allowed an assassin to walk right up to you. 
 Collier: Would NTAC like a presence at the gate tomorrow? 
 Diana: Yes! 
 Tom: Mr Collier, we don't stand off to the side and watch, we take command. 
 Collier: I'll issue credentials. That was a rather dramatic demonstration of competence just now. 
 Shawn is in his room taking off his jacket. Liv is lying on the couch. 
 Liv: What time is it? 
 Shawn: It's about 2 '0'clock. 
 Liv: How did I end up here, anyway? 
 Shawn: Liv, you were pretty far gone last night, but are you really trying to tell me that you don't remember? 
 Liv: I remember. You don't have to hover over me. I'm not gonna steal anything. Your maid can come and clean the couch as soon as I'm gone. 
 He sit's opposite her. 
 Shawn: How many of these nights do you think you have left in you? 
 Liv: Hopefully not too many. You've seen my life. When I OD, it's not gonna be a big loss, right? 
 Shawn: That is not true. 
 Liv: How's it gonna change? 
 Shawn: I used to feel the same way. I mean't what I told you. I can't save the whole world and I can't even save your friends. I'm sorry, but if you're serious about wanting to change, maybe I can save you. 
 Liv: How? 
 Shawn: By giving you the same thing that saved me. 
 He shows her a 4400 key. 
 The day of the gala arrives and crowds of people are in the center. Collier appears and the photographers go crazy as do the crowd. Tom is mingling. The crowd is shouting out to Jordan. 'Jordan!' 'Oh, thankyou' 
 Tom [Into earpiece]: He's here. 
 Shawn walks up to Lily and Richard. He brushes past a woman 
 Shawn: Excuse me. 
 He touches Isabelle's hand. 
 Shawn: Hello there Here we go. 
 Collier is being greeted by everyone 
 Woman: Nice to meet you. 
 Collier: It's good to see you. 
 Collier has a beaming smile on his face. Diana brushes past some people 
 Diana: Excuse me sir. 
 She walks up to Tom. 
 Diana: All the guests check out so far. 
 Tom: Yeah, we've secured the surrounding rooftop. Did a bomb sweep. 
 Diana: Now it's cross your fingers time. 
 Tom: Yeah. 
 Collier touches Isabelle's hand. Lily is looking uncomfortable . 
 Shawn picks up the mic and speaks to everyone. 
 Shawn: Good afternoon. Thankyou for coming to the center. We have a great day planned for you, but before we get started, I'd like to thank the man who made this all possible. I mean that literally. He didn't just pay for the food. He built this place and this movement. So I'd like you to please welcome, a mentor, a friend, Mr Jordan Collier. 
 They hug and Shawn hands Collier the mic and walks over to Lily and Richard. Lily looks sullen as he approaches them. 
 Collier: Thankyou! And thankyou Shawn for that introduction. 
 Quinlan appears in the crowd. 
 Collier: Um, we are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests. Many of whom risked so much to be here today. 
 Tom see's Quinlan and makes his way over to him. Tom and Diana grab him. 
 Tom: Let's go. 
 Quinlan: I want to hear what the man has to say for himself! 
 As they begin to pull him out, someone else is using a scope to target Collier. Shot's ring out and people begin screaming. Collier is shot through the right hand side of his chest and Shawn looks on in horror. Tom see's the sniper on the roof opposite. 
 Shawn: Jordan? 
 Tom: He's up there!! 
 Diana: Go! 
 Tom begins running. 
 Diana: Everybody stay down! 
 Male: Stay away from the window! 
 Diana: Everyone just calm down! Just stay down! Stay down! Stay down. 
 She begins running. Isabelle is crying as Lily hugs her tightly. Shawn get's to the stage and is grabbed by guards. 
 Shawn: Let me go! Let me go! Jordan. Oh God! 
 Medic: Get that stretcher ready. 
 They push him back. 
 Medic: Please let us do our job guys. 
 Shawn: Noooo! 
 Collier isn't breathing. 
 Tom makes his way outside as pedestrians run out of the way. He see's the man who's dressed in black. The man runs off. 
 Tom: Hey! 
 Back with Shawn and Collier. 
 Shawn: Please let me go. Please. 
 He get's to Collier and begins to try and heal him. Jordan arches up and takes a deep breath. 
 Medic: Pulse is weak and thready. 
 Medic: Pressure! Come on, let's go. Hurry up! 
 Tom chases after the gunman who get's onto the roof. 
 Tom: Freeze! 
 Tom can't get up to the roof and shouts out in frustration. 
 Tom: Aagghh! 
 The medics battle to save Collier. 
 Medic: Breathing's stopped, we're losing him again. Come on. 
 Shawn: No! You're not going anywhere's yet. 
 He shouts out as he tries once more to heal him. Collier takes another deep breath and looks at him. 
 Collier: Shawn. Shawn. She told me to go through with it. 
 Shawn: Who did? Who did? 
 Collier: She lies, Shawn. 
 Collier stops breathing. 
 Shawn: No don't go anywhere. Don't! No!! Nooo!! 
 Lily carries Isabelle to meet with Brian who is sat drinking coffee. 
 Brian: Lily. 
 Lily: Brian, I don't have much time. I did not violate our agreement. Heidi found me. 
 Brian: Lily, Heidi's sick. She's in the hospital. It happened yesterday. Something with her spleen. They had to operate right away. 
 Lily: Is she ok? Can I see her? 
 Brian: She's ok. She's still recovering from the anesthesia. She's been asking for you. She's still in recovery now but Carole thinks it's alright if you wanna go in there tomorrow. 
 Lily: Brian, what happened. Her spleen? She's twelve years old. 
 Brian: It just ruptured. Her doctors said they've never seen anything like it. Even they can't tell us why. 
 Lily looks down at Isabelle. 
 Later, back at the center. 
 Richard: Where've you been? The funerals about to start. Lily what's wrong, what is it? 
 Lily: Heidi's sick and I think Isabelle's responsible. 
 Shawn is standing alone beside Colliers open casket. Lucy walks in behind him. 
 Lucy: I think they're ready for you. 
 A large amount of people are sat in front of the stage as Shawn walks out. 
 Shawn: You are uh, going to read a lot about Jordan Collier in the next few weeks. Uh, some of it good, a lot of it bad. I will be ignoring all of it, just like Jordan would have. 
 Tom and Diana are sat watching. 
 Shawn: Because Jordan may have used the media, but he never allowed himself to be seduced by it. I could tell you how much I owe the man. He took me in when I was feeling lost and alone, confused. I'm sure many of you have similar stories. The fact is that everyone alive today, whether they know it or not, owes Jordan Collier. He had a vision to save the future and he gave us that vision and now he won't be here to see us achieve it. But we will achieve it! 
 Shawn is crying. 
 Shawn: I promise you, we will achieve it. We have all suffered a tremendous loss. We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside, but we will not let that stop us and I will not let that stop me. We will honour Jordan Collier and we will create the better future, that he died building. 
 People shake Shawn's hand as they leave. Tom looks on. 
 Shawn: Thanks for coming. Bye 
 Tom approaches him. 
 Tom: Nice words Shawn. I think Collier would have approved. 
 Shawn: Yeah, I hope so. He would have liked that you came. 
 Tom: Oh, I don't think that I was that high on his radar. 
 Shawn: Don't be too sure. You guys bumped heads but you believed the same thing. That the 4400 are the key to the future. Your goals were identical. 
 Tom: But our methods were different. 
 Shawn: Not as different as you think. 
 Tom: You see, that's where your view of Jordan Collier splits from mine. 
 Shawn: Well, at least we have some common ground. Maybe your side and my side could work together, now that I'm assuming new duties around here. 
 Shawn has tears in his eyes. 
 Tom: Becoming quite the little politician, Shawn. Now I know Collier would have been proud of you. 
 Someone screams and Lucy runs out of the room housing Collier's casket. 
 Lucy: He's gone! His body, it's not there! 
 Tom runs into the room and Shawn follows him. 
 Lucy: Someone stole the body. 
 Tom: There's only one way out. I was standing right in front of it. Stole it how? 
 Lucy: Then what happened? 
 Isabelle is sleeping and Lily looks down at her. 
 Meanwhile Diana is at home with Maia on her lap, looking at the court documents. She rips them up. 
 The Seattle Advance newspaper has a picture of Shawn trying to heal Collier on it's front page with the heading, 'Jordan Collier Murdered. Who is The 4400 Healer?' 
 Liv is nicely dressed and walks past some guards towards Shawns office. She wears a 4400 key around her neck. She stops just before the door and looks in, smiling. Shawn is at his desk surrounded by others. She waves as he looks up, but he looks back down and the doors are closed. 
 Tom is looking through Colliers file. 
 The sniper is placing the gun back in the bag and throwing it in the lake. It's Kyle. He walks away.
