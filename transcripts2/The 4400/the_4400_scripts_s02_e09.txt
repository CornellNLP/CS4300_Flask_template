 Les Cicatrices du Passé 
(2x09 : Rebirth) 
 Written by LISA MELAMED 
Directed by MILAN CHEYLOV 
 **Previously on The 4400** 
 A welcome home party is held for Shawn. 
 Nikki:Remember me? 
 Shawn: Nikki? 
 They kiss. 
 Shawn: You're the only good thing that's happened to me since I've been back. 
 Danny fights with Shawn. 
 Susan: Danny! 
 Shawn: Danny, stop blaming me for Nikki! 
 Susan: Shawn, stop it, you're killing him! 
 April stands at a newstand with Maia, scratching lottery cards. 
 April: So, this whole see the future thing? It doesn't just apply to Earth shattering events, huh? 
 Maia: Not always. 
 Maia picks out a winning card. 
 Maia: That one. 
 April: Baby girl. You are my new lucky charm. 
 Later, at home. 
 April: Do you know what I bet? Try my Mother's diamond engagement ring. And not it's gone. 
 Maia: You said winning didn't matter. You said you liked me. 
 April: This was all just a test. 
 Maia: And you failed. 
 Shawn is in his office with Lucy, looking over a press statement. 
 Shawn: It doesn't sound like me, Lucy. 
 Lucy: So change it. You're the boss. 
 Matthew enters the office. 
 Matthew: Matthew Ross. 
 Shawn: Yes. 
 Matthew: Jordan made it clear, that in the event of his death, I was to step up front and center to help you out. The ground just shifted under your feet. You either find your balance, or fall on your ass. 
 Shawn makes a speech at Collier's memorial. 
 Shawn: The fact is, that everyone alive today, owes Jordan Collier. He had a vision to save the future. 
 Kyle bumps into Wendy on campus. 
 Wendy: You were waiting in the hallway outside my apartment last night. 
 Kyle: I don't know how I got there, please believe me. I had another blackout last night. 
 Kyle has a flashback and remembers killing Collier. 
 **Present time** 
 It's morning and Kyle is sleeping in bed. Tom knocks on the door. 
 Richard is in the foyer of the 4400 center. He see's a man that he seem's to recognise and approaches him. 
 Richard: Ben? 
 Ben: Tyler? My God, you haven't changed. 
 Richard: 50 year vacation will do that for you. You look... 
 Ben: I look old. Especially next to you. I had you beat by eight months. Last time I saw you was in a tent. 
 Richard: Outside of St Andrew, Korea. 
 Ben: May 11th 1951. 
 Richard: You remember the date? 
 Ben: Sometimes I have trouble remembering my grandkids birthday, but that's a date, I'll never forget. I mean, Lee hit you and you uh, well you disappeared. 
 Richard has a flashback to his abduction. 
 Richard: So uh, what you doing here, Ben? 
 Ben: You remember Milton Weinburg, your old uh, wingman. 
 Richard: Milt was the first guy who invited me over to sit at his table in the officer's mess. 
 Ben: He passed on. Parkinson's disease. I'm sorry, I keow you guy's were close and I'm sure he would want you at the funeral. 
 Richard: Is uh, Lee gonna be there? 
 Richard has another flashback to the beating before the abduction. 
 Lee: We treated you as an equal. That was good enough for you. You crossed the line. 
 Back to the present. 
 Ben: None of us have spoken to Lee in years. 
 Richard: I'll be there out of respect for Milt. 
 A couple are in a hospital. The woman sits in bed looking very worried. A male Nurse brings in a baby to her. 
 Mrs Ward: Is he ok? 
 Edwin: Better than ok. Heartrate, respiration, reflexes, all above average. Say hello to your healthy child. 
 Mr Ward: I mean, I can't even find the words. Doc, we don't know how to find you. 
 Mrs Ward: And he's gonna know all about you. The Nurse that changed his life. 
 Edwin: Enjoy your son, Mr and Mrs Watt Keep him safe. 
 The nurse is Edwin Mayuya who disappeared on February 24th, 1996. 
 Edwin leaves the room and walks out into the busy hallway. 
 Doctor: Edwin, do you have a second? 
 Edwin: I'm sorry Doctor, I'm due in the nursery. 
 Doctor: It can wait. I wanna know what you did to the Ward baby. We did amnio in the first trimester. That baby was diagnosed with Prado Rey syndrome. 
 Edwin: Perhaps there was some mistake in the tests. 
 Doctor: You saw those results Edwin. The 15th chromosome was damaged. That indicates severe mental retardation at birth, but their kid just scored nine on the apgar test. 
 Edwin: A miracle is traditionally cause for celebration, not an inquisition. 
 Doctor: This is the fourth time this has happened in the last six months. In every one of those cases Edwin, you are the attending nurse and you're one of the 4400. 
 Edwin: I'm not sure I see the connection. 
 Doctor: Everyone's read about that kid who's running the 4400 center now. They say he's cured diseases like ALS. Diseases no hospital in the world can put a dent in. He's a healer. So are you. 
 Edwin: For me, it only works in utero. I can feel the damage to their chromosomes. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but somehow I'm able to repair them. 
 Doctor: That's incredible. 
 Edwin: Dr Ordler. If it's all the same to you, I prefer to work anonymously. 
 Doctor: There are already rumours in this hospital ofmiracle births there have been. And people talk. I don't think you're gonna have that option. 
 She walks away. 
 Kyle has another flashback to the shooting. He is standing outside the buiding opposite the center, at night. The witness who helped out the NTAC artist see's him and runs off. 
 Titles 
 Diana and Tom are in the office. 
 Diana: Wait a minute. It's Gavin Mar, I read his statement yesterday. Why are they sending us these again? 
 Tom: Maybe we missed something. 
 Diana: There were a thousand people at the party where Collier got assassinated. Wouldn't you think that they could at least send us a new set of completely useless files? 
 Nina arrives. 
 Nina: Anymore leads in there? Didn't think so. I'm pulling you off the Collier case. Just for the moment. 
 Tom: Something important I hope. 
 Nina: One of the thousand in the research report caught my eye. There's an internet chatroom for pregnant women. Yesterday, someone started a thread about some unexplained reverses of birth defects at Mercy Hospital. 
 Tom: So you're yanking us off Collier to check out internet chat. 
 Nina: Uh huh 
 Diana: There's a 4400 works at the hospital. 
 Nina: Bingo! 
 Edwins file is opened by Shawn. 
 Matthew: Edwin Mayuya. He was born in Rwanda. 
 Shawn: This guy's some kind of healer. 
 Matthew: According to the internet. Don't worry, you're still the alpha dog. 
 Shawn: It's not like I mind. It's great if he is, of course. Should we invite him to the center? 
 Matthew: At the very least. I think Mr Mayuya merits a sit down. 
 Shawn: Alright, set it up. I'll be there. 
 Matthew: Why don't you let me handle the meet and greet. I'll figure out if there's anything to these stories. In the meantime, there's a move I'd like you to consider making. Call it the next phase in your development as a leader. 
 Shawn: Matthew, I told you I would read The Art Of War, ok? 
 Matthew: I want you to call your Mom. I know Jordan counselled you to distance yourself from your family. 
 Shawn: Before Jordan was telling me anything, my family had already distanced themselves from me. 
 Matthew: Family dynamics are complex. 
 Shawn: I don't think that a phone call is gonna lead straight into some kind of group hug. 
 Matthew: Even if it just leads to dinner, you're heading in the right direction. 
 Shawn: But Matthew. What is it to you? 
 Matthew: Right now, every news desk in the country is taking a long hard look at you. They're looking for a weakness. 
 Shawn: And because I'm not speaking to my family, that implies what? Everybody here's supposed to do likewise? 
 Matthew: The press will spin it that way. That's how they smear us with the cult label. 
 Shawn: You want me to stir up all of this old business, as a publicity ploy? 
 Matthew: You take care of it now, or wait. See it splashed all over the newspapers. Here's your Mom's phone number. In case you forgot. 
 Matthew walks out. 
 People gather around a casket at the cemetary. The last post is being played. Richard is standing among other men, who all salute. Afterwards, Richard walks up to a group of men. 
 Man 1: How do you think I rang the bell? 
 Ben: Uh, we were just saying what a nice ceremony this was. Old Milty left a great family behind. 
 Richard: He had a lot of love to spread around, huh? 
 Man 2: We thought you got killed. Or captured maybe. 
 Ben: There was some talk you went AWOL. 
 Man 2: None of us put any stock in that. 
 Richard: Disappearing in a beam of light. Nobody thought of that, huh? 
 They all laugh 
 Ben: Hey uh, you in town tonight? 
 Richard nods. 
 Ben: Good. We're gonna have our own private wake for Milt, down at Shaugnessy's. You know, he loved his buds, so we're gonna hoist a few in his memory. 
 Man 2: You should come. We'll kick around old times. 
 Richard: Old times was hardly more than a year ago for me. 
 Ben: You can fill in the gaps then. There's a lot of stuff we don't remember any more. 
 Richard: Chance to swap tall tales with you old duffers? Wouldn't miss it. 
 Diana and Tom go to the hospital to speak with Edwin. 
 Edwin: NTAC has examined me several times already this year. I don't think I'm due for another, for three months I believe. 
 Tom: You've never missed an appointment. We appreciate that. 
 Diana: You just admitted to us that you've developed this ability. It's a kind of Earth shaking one, I have to say. 
 Edwin: Forgive me, but I don't see how submitting me to another round of tests, helps anyone. 
 Tom: These mutations you can induce.... 
 Edwin: I believe they are not mutations sir, I believe they are repairs. 
 Diana: Either way, our Doctors need to take a look at you. If they can figure out the way your ability works, it could help a lot of people. 
 Edwin: Alright then. I will let your Doctor's poke and prod me to their hearts content. But I ask one thing. That you allow me my privacy. I do not want to become a public figure. 
 Tom: Well that works for us. Whenever a new ability leaks to the press, good, bad or whatever, it stirs a lot of people up. 
 Edwin: Precisely what I hope to avoid. I've seen firsthand the type of behaviour that irrational fears can provoke. 
 Diana: You left Rwanda in April of 1994. That was the beginning of the Tutsi's genocide. 
 Edwin: The beginning. Believe me, I saw my fill of horrors during those two weeks. If I hadn't been granted asylum here in America, I'd be dead. 
 Tom: You were probably just getting used to the place, when you got abducted, I'm sure. 
 Edwin: There were nights in Kagali when I would have welcomed the chance to disappear from the face of this Earth. 
 Diana returns home that night. 
 Diana: So uh, just let me get this straight. You used Maia's predictions, so that you can gamble? 
 April: I didn't use her to gamble. I used her to win. 
 Diana: You mean that you used her to cheat. You exploited a nine year old girl who loves you. 
 April: She was having a good time. We both were! 
 Diana: But only one of you is an adult. I can't believe that you're standing there defending it. 
 April: Well this part of it. I can kind of mount a credible defense. 
 Diana: What, so you haven't got to the part that you're ashamed of yet? 
 April: These bets? They were sure things. But I needed money to make them. You know Mom's engagement ring? 
 Diana: You mean the one that she left to me. 
 April: The one I should have worn to my wedding. I pawned it. 
 Diana: I just can't believe that I let Maia anywhere near you. I want you out of here. 
 Diana walks away and Maia stands in her bedroom doorway. 
 Matthew walks into Shawn's outer office to find Lucy sat at her desk. 
 Matthew: Lucy! If I watch the news tonight, am I gonna be a happy man? 
 Lucy: The stations I called all seemed very interested. 
 Matthew: A 4400 who cures birth defects. I'd cover it. I suppose the tip was anonymous. 
 Lucy: Believe me, I didn't wanna leave my name. The center outing a 4400 to the media? Seem's wrong somehow. 
 Matthew: Well it's not business as usual, I grant you. But we leak it, we control the story. And it beats letting him rot in the basement at NTAC. Did Shawn go upstairs for the night? 
 Lucy: He went out. Personal business he said. 
 Matthew turns and smiles. 
 Matthew: Goodnight Lucy 
 Shawn turns up at his Mother's house and knocks on the door. 
 Susan: Who is it? Hello? 
 Shawn: Mom, you gonna open the door, or should I use my key? 
 She opens the door. 
 Susan: Shawn! 
 She launches herself into his arms. 
 Shawn: I would have called ahead, but I, surprise! 
 A news bulletin is on TV with the headlines 'Another 4400 Healer?' A black woman sits in a chair, watching. 
 Newscaster: Will the 4400 be the cure for all Human disease? That's the question on everyone's lips as it appears a member of the 4400 has manifested the ability to reverse certain genetic birth defects in utero. Anonymous sources claim that Edwin Mayuya, a 38 year old nurse at Mercy Hospital is responsible for a series of miraculous healings over the lpast five months. 
 The woman jumps out of her chair and begins shouting at the television. 
 Woman: Murderer! Murderer! 
 A younger woman bursts into the room. 
 Woman: That's the one. The one who killed your parents! 
 Richard and his old friends sit in the bar reminiscing over old times. 
 Ben: Wait, there's more. I'm bouncing around the shotgun and Tyler here has got the gas pedal all the way through the floor. 
 Richard: We had two hundred bucks on that race. 
 Ben: Now Davis is 30 feet behind me and I can barely hear him screaming, 'Not that way! That's where the landmines are!' 
 Richard: If I knew he was serious, maybe I'd have paid attention. 
 Ben:Well no-one was gonna follow us that way, so we came in two minutes before the pack, split the money. 
 Richard: Bought like, five kegs of budweisser for the officers club. 
 Ben holds up a can 
 Ben: Get a load of this. Look's just like it did back in the day. 
 Man 2: Like you Tyler. 
 Ben: Hard to believe. 50 years go by,. We got the same guys, same beer. 
 Man 2: It's great to see you guy's. It's a shame it took Milt dying, to make it happen. 
 Ben: It's hard to find excuses to get the whole gang together. 
 Richard: It's not exactly the whole gang, is it? There's always uh, Lee. So when are you guy's gonna tell me where he is. 
 Ben: Come on, does it matter? 
 Richard: It matters to me. 
 Ben: Well, the last I heard, he was in a VA hospital outside of Baker street. The guy's been in bad shape for a long time. Look, everyone here feels terrible about what we did to you. Isn't that enough? You're not gonna get anything out of talking to Lee. Do yourself a favour. Just let it go. 
 The black woman from earlier is in Nina's office. Tom arrives outside and approaches Diana. 
 Tom: What's up? 
 Agent: You know your miracle healer? Turns out his name is Edwin Musinga. 
 Diana: All his papers have been forged. He's been wanted by the Rwandan Government since 1995. 
 Tom: Wanted for what? 
 Agent: Atrocities. He was a Doctor during the uprisings. He's killed a whole bunch of people. 
 Edwin is interviewed. 
 Edwin: I was a paediatrician at a clinic in Kadari.I'm a Hutus, but most of my patients were Tutsi. Many of my friends as well. They called my loyalty into question when the killings began.Some men from the military came to my clinic and said they wanted to broadcast it as a safehouse. A place Tutsi could come to be safe from the slaughter. 
 Diana: And they came. 
 Edwin: By 3 'o'clock, the clinic was full. Every room, every corridor, all filled with frightened Tutsi looking to me as their protector. The same soldiers came back with militia at their side. 
 Tom: It was a set-up. Did you at least try to stop them? 
 Edwin: The radio reports were claiming the Tutsi's had killed our President. The anger spread like fires. I got infected too. 
 Tom: So basically you stood by and did nothing. 
 Edwin: All over the city, it was organised murder. We never would have made it to safety. 
 Tom: You could have tried. 
 Diana: Easy Tom. Let the man finish his story. 
 Edwin: Yes, I could have tried. That's true, I know that now. They made me watch. They killed them all. I allowed them to turn my clinic into a slaughterhouse. 
 Diana: But you didn't murder anyone, personally. 
 Edwin: True. But not much about this thing shone. I knew what was going to happen. I let it take place. I am guilty. My wife left me. I haven't seen her or my children since. Perhaps they will come to my execution. 
 Diana: Your government's pushing for extradition. 
 Tom: You should be on a plane right now! 
 Diana: But your ability complicates things. 
 Edwin: It would give me the chance to make amends, but I could save an infant a day for the rest of my life and I'd still deserve every one of my nightmares. 
 Tom and Diana leave the room. 
 Diana: What was going on in there, Tom? Because if you were looking to shut him down before he got his story out, all that glaring was a great way to go about it. 
 Tom: That guy should be on his way to a tribunal! Instead, we're serving him lunch downstairs. 
 Diana: So what? Would you prefer it if we starved him? 
 Tom: I don't believe you're defending him. 
 Diana: I would never defend what he did! But I would make an arguement for what he can do now. I mean, there's a reason the future sent him back with this amazing ability, but forgive me if I sound like, I don't know, you. 
 Tom: No, no, not this time! We're not talking about a criminal. We're not even talking about a murderer. We're talking about genocide, Diana! Maybe the future doesn't have a problem with that, but I do. 
 Diana: So if I don't think the world is better off with a bullet in this guy's head, I'm advocating genocide? 
 Tom: No, but there are people in Rwanda, right now, who have lost Mother's, brother's and children in that clinic and he stood by and he let it happen. 
 Diana: It's just like our government. Just like governments all over the world. They all knew what was happening Tom, but nobody lifted a finger to stop it. 
 Tom: Yeah, that was wrong too and so is this. We've been working on blind faith for a year and a half, assuming these people knew what they were doing, but enough is enough. Yeah, we're saving the future, but we're leaving justice behind. Is it something that you wanna be a part of, Diana? 
 Danny and Kyle are walking on campus. 
 Danny: So Shawn just shows out of nowhere, and all of a sudden I'm just supposed to drop all my plans and get with some peace dinner. I mean, we both know why he's turned up now, right? You don't have to be a shrink to piece it together. His mentor Daddy figure get's killed and he comes crawling back to Mommy. 
 Kyle: Danny, why don't you quit whining about Shawn alright? He's your brother. It's been a year, let it go. 
 Danny: Hey, you're the guy who talked to him and told me how brainwashed he is. 
 Kyle: So he's coming to dinner, that's a good thing, right? At least pretend it is for your Mom's sake. 
 Danny: What's with the attitude, man? 
 Kyle: I just don't wanna hear you bitch anymore, ok? 
 Kyle walks away 
 April is packing and Maia stands watching her 
 Maia: I don't understand. Why do you have to go? Can't you just say you're sorry? 
 April: It doesn't alway's work that way with grown ups. Sometimes things get so messed up that sorry doesn't cut it. It happens a lot when I'm involved, actually. 
 Maia: But if you only just leave, nothing get's better. 
 April walks over and kneels in front of her. 
 April: Sweetie. I'm sorry, I used you. It was wrong. 
 Maia: But I forgive you. 
 April: I still have to go. 
 They hug and April takes her bag and leaves. 
 Shawn, Danny and Susan sit down to dinner. Both Danny and Shawn look uncomfortable. 
 Susan: Well, I know I cooked all day, but is my lasagne really that great you're both just stunned into silence? 
 Shawn: I haven't had this stuff in like, a year? 
 Susan: Good, you said something. Danny, why don't you give it a try. 
 Danny doesn't say anything. 
 Shawn: Alright, you know what, that's it! Danny, this entire night is about you and me. That's why Mom did this. 
 Danny: Yeah? What do you want me to do, say we're all fine and dandy? It's not that easy! 
 Shawn: I don't expect it to be, but you and I obviously have some stuff we need to get into the open. 
 Danny: Ok, so you're gonna apologise to me now. Is that it? Or was I just imagining it when you screwed my girlfriend! 
 Shawn: The thing with Nikki. I wish it wouldn't have happened that way! 
 Danny: What about almost stopping my heart, or whatever it is that you did. You feel bad about that too? 
 Shawn: You know what? You wanna hate me forever, you be my guest! But you're my brother and I came here to make things right by you! What do you want me to do? You need to punch me in the face or something? I mean, be my guest. 
 Danny stands. 
 Susan: Danny, don't you dare! 
 Danny: Just one shot Ma, he deserves it. Look, he's even asking for it. 
 A long silence follows. 
 Shawn: Are we ok? Are we done? 
 Tom and Diana are in Nina's office. 
 Tom: We're letting him walk. He's responsible for hundreds of deaths. 
 Nina: His degree of culpability is not for us to determine. Ok look, I can't ship him off to Rwanda. Not yet anyway. In the meantime, his 48 hour hold is up and the 4400 center has hired lawyers who are pressing for his release. 
 Diana: The press are all over this story. Is he even gonna be safe on the streets? 
 Tom: Yeah, a war criminal's safety, that's my big concern. 
 Nina: Oh, it better be! In exchange for protection, Edwin Mayuya has agreed to continue coming into our labs. 
 Tom: We're babysitting him? 
 Diana: In a chance to study what he can do. This guy could advance genetic research by a hundred years. It sounds like a fair trade to me. 
 Nina: Mmmm Hmmm! 
 A hostile crowd has gathered outside Edwin's home. Tom and Diana are inside with him. 
 Diana: How long have you been feeling faint? 
 Edwin: On and off , perhaps a month. 
 Diana: You should have told your Doctors. 
 Edwin: Don't forget Miss Skouris, I am a doctor, I've been anaemic since I was fifteen. I'm certain..... 
 A bullet smashes through the window. 
 Tom: You ok? 
 Diana: Yeah 
 Tom: Stay with him, I'm going out. 
 Tom runs out of the room. Edwin stands up. 
 Diana: Stay down! Stay down! Stay down! 
 Tom walks outside and strides through the crowd. A police car pulls up and Tom walks over and shows his ID card. 
 Tom: Get these people outta here! I want a patrol car passing by every 20 minutes! 
 Female: Help! Somebody call an ambulance! 
 The elderly black woman from earlier is lying on the ground. Her granddaughter is by her side. 
 Tom: I think she's having a heart attack. 
 Female: He did this to her! Why are you protecting him. He's a murderer! 
 An ambulance later takes the woman away. Diana remains in the apartment with Edwin. 
 Edwin: How did this become public? 
 Diana: Well I assure you, it wasn't NTAC. 
 Edwin: Perhaps if I had gone out and spoken to them earlier, this could have been avoided. 
 Diana: Oh yeah, that would have calmed them down. They could have torn you apart. 
 Edwin: I think I have already demonstrated the lengths I am willing to go in order to live. 
 Tom storms into the room. 
 Tom: You can add another name victim to your list. That woman is dead. 
 Diana: Ok Tom. Why don't you just go back outside, take a walk around the block. 
 Tom: You know why she was out there, huh? Cos this son of a bitch let her son, her daughter in law and about eight of her nephew's and nieces, die. 
 He grabs Edwin and pushes him against the wall. 
 Tom: Isn't that right, Doctor! Isn't that right? 
 Diana: Tom, stop! Stop. 
 Edwin: I regret her death. Same as I regret them all. 
 Tom: Yeah well, I'm sorry you feel bad, but it doesn't change anything, does it? 
 Diana: Tom, enough! Let him go, now! Let him go! 
 Tom backs away. 
 
 
 
 The 4400 Center 
 Matthew is on the phone as Shawn looks on. 
 Matthew: Look Benjamin, I don't see what the problem is. Edwin Masinga never killed anybody. Not personally, anyway. I already told you which Senators to call. Get face time if you can. Do I have to fly out there and do this myself? I thought not. Black bear me when things start to tip 
 The call ends. 
 Shawn: Full court press is on. 
 Matthew: I kinda wish I was out there. Cash in a few favours. Watch the hill fall in line. 
 Shawn: You really wanna be cashing in favours for this guy? He say's himself, he's dirty. 
 Matthew: Oh he's worse than dirty. He's practically a mass murderer. 
 Shawn: So why are we wasting our time with him? Somebody might come along who actually deserves our help, Matthew. 
 Matthew: He's a 4400. Guilty or not, he's a part of what we're doing. They gave him that ability for a reason and I doubt it has anything to do with being executed in Rwanda. 
 Shawn: So let's say he didn't come back with an ability. Would we still be fighting the good fight on his behalf? 
 Matthew: You're the boss. You tell me. 
 Shawn looks down at his desk and doesn't seem to have an answer. 
 Diana and Maia are in their apartment. Diana is making breakfast and Maia is sitting on the couch. 
 Diana: Breakfast is ready! You know you're gonna have to start talking to me eventually, right? I seriously doubt that you can hold out till you're 18. 
 She walks into the living room. Maia refuses to look up at her, so she's sits opposite her. 
 Diana: She used you, Maia. 
 Maia: She said she was sorry. 
 Diana: Well, there still has to be consequences. Now your ability is a gift, but it makes you a target too and I have to protect you from people who want to exploit you. Besides, you're not the only one your Aunt April hurt this week. 
 Maia: But I showed her the ring. She wouldn't even have known about it if it weren't for me. 
 Diana: Well, you should never have been playing with it, which is why you don't get any TV this week. What your Aunt did was completely different and she knows it. 
 Maia: She made a bad mistake. Isn't that what having a family's about? Forgiving someone when they make a bad mistake? 
 Diana: It doesn't matter if I forgive her. I just can't have her around you. 
 Maia: But we don't have such a big family. We can't just kick someone out. EVEN if they mess up. 
 Diana: Maia, do me a favour. Stop being more grown up than your Mom. Now just, come one, come on, your cereal's getting mushy. Let's go. 
 Diana returns to the kitchen and Maia follows her. 
 Danny and Kyle are sat on the steps on campus. 
 Danny: I am not kidding you. It was like, the most intense lecture I think I've ever given. He took it like a man, I'll give him that. After that, we ate and we talked a little bit. I'm surprised. It was pretty much ok. 
 Kyle: Good to hear. 
 Danny: I'm glad I went. Ah, you know what that makes you. Right! 
 Kyle isn't really paying attention and is staring into the distance. 
 Kyle: Yeah, I'm a genius. 
 Danny: I don't get it Kyle. Look, you're pissed at me when I tell you that I don't wanna see Shawn. Then I do it and I tell you it went pretty good and all I get is a big shrug. 
 Kyle jumps up. 
 Kyle: Nobody asked you to sit here, Danny. 
 Danny chases after him. 
 Danny: What's going on Kyle? Are you blacking out again? 
 Kyle: Just forget it. 
 Danny: Look, if you don't tell me what's going on, I'll talk to your Dad. 
 Kyle turns around in anger. 
 Kyle: I'm not blacking out, alright? I feel fine. You're not saying a word to my Dad! 
 He pushes Danny hard in the chest. 
 Danny: Yeah? Then tell me why you're walking around like a zombie. 
 Kyle: I can remember now. Some of the things I was doing during those blackouts. I can remember. 
 Danny: Like what? 
 Kyle: I'm in trouble, that's all I can tell you. I'm in big trouble. 
 Danny: Is there anything I can do? 
 Kyle: Help yourself. Stay away from me. 
 Richard visits Lee. He sits in a chair beside the man who is attached to an oxygen tank. Lee notices him. 
 Lee: Got a cigarette? 
 Richard: You have emphysema. 
 Lee: I know I have emphysema. But what I don't have, is a cigarette. 
 Richard: Do you know who I am? 
 Lee: For a second I thought you were the angel of death Richard Tyler. 
 Richard nods. 
 Lee: How was Weinburg's funeral? 
 Richard: Simple. Dignified. Kind of like Milt. 
 Lee: Never did like his politics much. You know, after you disappeared, he blamed me. Fought me once or twice. Course he was wrong. So, what are you here for? Slap me around a little bit? Shut off my oxygen tank? 
 Richard: Nah. You don't make a very appealing target these day's, Lee. 
 Lee: What then? Looking for an apology? 
 Richard: When I first got back, I used to lie awake in quarantine thinking about you. All the things I would do to you if I ever saw you again. 
 Lee: Oh! You want vengeance! Well, sorry to disappoint you. That's not gonna work out either. Time has kicked my ass worse than you ever could. 
 Richard: Time kicks everybody's ass, Lee. 
 Lee: Get you too, eventually. Caught up with old uh, Milt, didn't it, for sure? 
 Richard: At the funeral,those guys were tripping over themselves to say sorry. But you had fifty years to dwell on what you did. 
 Lee: I didn't like hitting a fellow officer, but you gave me cause! I ate beside you, I fought beside you, but when you took up with a white woman, you crossed the line. 
 Richard: That's what you said back then. 
 Lee: I'm saying it again now. 
 Richard: The world's changed Lee, or haven't you noticed? 
 Lee:The world maybe, not me. 
 Richard: And how's that working out for you? Stopped by your room. No cards, no flowers. Lady at the front desk couldn't believe you had a visitor. 
 Lee: You know, I really wish you'd brought some cigarettes. 
 Richard: You always did stick to your habits, Lee. Even after they started to kill you. So long. 
 Richard gets up and walks away. 
 Diana and Tom are looking at some pictures of the atrocities in Rwanda. 
 Tom: They're not just statistics, Diana. He let that happen. 
 Diana: I know what he did and I don't need you to rub my nose in it. 
 Tom: It's worth putting the faces to the numbers. 
 Nina walks in. 
 Nina: We've got a problem. 
 She walks past them and they follow her towards the elevator. 
 Nina: The State Department has decided to fight extradition. They're gonna argue special circumstances. 
 Tom: So Edwin gets a pass? 
 Nina: Who knows how many kids will get a shot at a normal life. 
 Nina: No, not as many as we hoped. Our labs can't even figure out how his ability works. Forget about replicating it. And I just got his med eval. Turns out he's in bad shape. 
 Diana: Well he told me he's anaemic and he couldn't sleep. 
 Nina: No, no, it's worse than that. This ability. Every time he rearranges a foetal chromosome he's damaging his own. 
 Tom: So if he keeps healing... 
 Nina: It's gonna kill him. 
 She gets into the elevator. 
 Danny and Shawn arrive at Kyle's house and sit with him in the living room. 
 Shawn: Listen, if you don't wanna talk about what you did, I'm not gonna try to force you to. But I guarantee you, whatever it is, there's a way out of it. 
 Kyle: That's easy to say. You don't know what it is. 
 Danny: So tell us. How can we help you if we don't know what's going on. 
 Kyle: I didn't ask for help. In fact, I told you not to mention it to anyone, Danny. 
 Shawn: And I'm not anyone. I'm your friend. 
 Kyle: Stop saying that ok? I know you two mean well, but you don't have a goddamn clue what you're talking about, alright? I have to deal with this on my own! 
 Danny: We get it! On your own. Absolutely! We're gonna help you do that! 
 Shawn: I think what he's trying to say is, if you need some time to clear your head and get away from everything so you can figure stuff out, I can make that happen. Come to the center with me, Kyle. 
 Kyle: You're turning this into a recruiting drive? 
 Shawn: That's not what I'm talking about. You'll have the space you need. No-one will bother you. Kyle, if you ever get to the point where you feel like you wanna talk to somebody, we have counsellors, therapists, lawyers. 
 Danny: It's worth a try, man. Cos, whatever you're doing right now, it's not working. 
 Shawn: My car's outside. You can come with me right now, if you want. 
 Kyle: Ok. Just let me...I've got a couple of things to take care of. Get a leave of absence from school. Stuff like that. I'll meet you there tonight. 
 Shawn: And I'll be waiting. 
 Kyle: Ok. Thankyou guys. 
 Tom and Diana visit Edwin at his home. 
 Edwin: How much time do I have left? 
 Diana: Well that's difficult to say. I mean, your genes are mutating every time you heal a foetus. There's an indication of heart disease developing. You have spinal irregularities on your MRI. If you keep healing, maybe a year, maybe less. 
 Edwin: And if I stop? 
 Diana: Oh well, if you stop healing, then there's no reason for the state department to stop the extradition. You'll be handed back to the Rwandan government. 
 Edwin: Who'll have me tried and sentenced without dispatch. So, either choice I make leads to my death. Yes, that's right. It would seem my abductors have quite a perverse sense of humour. I will of course, continue to heal for as long as my body allows. At least then, my death will have a purpose other than vengeance. 
 Diana: You'll have to be monitored by doctors from here on in. They'll try and slow your decline. But you really should come with us, because we have some of the best physicians in the world on the payroll. 
 Edwin: Miss Skouris, if you're offering me a bed at NTAC, I'm afraid I'll have to refuse. I did not pass up one prison so I could die in another. 
 Diana: There is one place you could go. 
 Edwin arrives at the 4400 center. Shawn and the rest of the staff are waiting for him. He walks through the doors with Diana. 
 Diana: NTAC medical's gonna need you five days a week, so I'll get you the schedule. 
 Matthew: I'll make sure he's there on time. Every time. Edwin Musinga, this is Shawn Farrell. He runs the center. You two have a lot in common. 
 Edwin: Not a lot. Just one thing. 
 Shawn: One very important thing. 
 Shawn holds out his hand and Edwin takes it. 
 Diana arrives back at NTAC and finds Tom waiting for her by the elevator. 
 Tom: Did you tell him? 
 Diana: Yeah, he's gonna keep healing. Not that that surprises me. I took him over to the 4400 center. I think he's probably better of there, than he is at home. How does it feel, Tom? Some babies will get saved and you'll get your pound of flesh. 
 Tom: You really wanna know? 
 Diana: I asked you, didn't I? 
 Tom: It feels like justice. 
 He walks away. 
 Richard is in his room, knocking a nail into the wall He picks up a photo of himself and his friends back in the 50's. 
 Diana rushes along a street at night. She walks to a bus shelter and finds April sat on a seat 
 Diana: Hi 
 April: How'd you find me? 
 Diana: Sometimes it's good to have a kid who knows things. What's in Berkley? 
 April: A tattoo shop that likes my work. 
 Diana: Oh. 
 April: Some friends I can force myself on for a while. Listen Di, I said this to Maia, but, I'm so sorry. 
 Diana: Well it's nice to hear, but it doesn't change anything. You are so deceitful and you're so untrustworthy and, well you're not seeing Maia until you've proven otherwise. 
 April: I wish I knew how to make things right. 
 Diana: I wish I did, too. But I do know it's gonna take a long time. But you're still my sister and you're the only one I've got. And I'm uh, well, I'm not giving up on you 
 Diana hands her the engagement ring. 
 April: You bought it back from the pawn shop. 
 Diana: I know you always felt that Mom should have left it to you and to tell you the truth, I thought she only gave it to me because she, well, she figured that was the only way I was ever going to get one of those things. Hmmm. That's a whole other therapy session. 
 April: Di, I don't deserve this. 
 Diana: No you don't, but you're gonna take it anyway. One day, Maia's gonna wear that ring to her wedding and I hope, well, I hope you know each other again by then. 
 April: Yeah. 
 The bus arrives and Diana leaves. April sits on the seat and cries. 
 Tom returns home to find a note from Kyle. 
 Tom: Kyle. 
 Kyle: Dad, I had to leave. I'm sorry. 
 Shawn tries to phone Kyle who hasn't turned up at the center. 
 Shawn: Kyle, it's me. Uh, where are you, man? It's 2am. You're not here yet. Listen, just, when you get this, call me or just show up, ok? Show up. Alright. 
 He puts the phone down and remembers the conversation with Kyle he had earlier in the day. 
 Kyle: I know you two mean well, but you don't have a goddamn clue what you're talking about, alright? I have to deal with this on my own!
