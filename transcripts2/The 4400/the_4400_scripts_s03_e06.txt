 We're not a threat. We're salvation. 
 The world will have to deal with us. 
 Previously on The 4400... My name is Daniel Armand. 
 - Know who lam? With the Nova Group? 
 I called to arrange a truce and to talk about Shawn Farrell. 
 We need to discuss his future. 
 Because unless you and I can come to some kind of agreement, I'm not sure he's gonna have one. 
 Believe me, I know which bench I dedicated to my husband and son. 
 They died in a car accident shortly before I was abducted. 
 Our enemies are more resourceful than we imagined. 
 And they've let loose a terrible evil into your time. 
 This evil, there has to be some other way to deal with it. There is. You. 
 You are the other way. 
 Oh, Tom. Good, you're here. 
 Yeah, just like always. 
 Well, come on. We need to get started. 
 Started with what? 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Sure you do. Come on, let's go. She's waiting. 
 What is this? 
 I brought her in. You can just do it, and we can get on with our day. 
 It? 
 No. 
 No way, I'm not. Tom, you're supposed to do this. 
 They told you so. I know. It's just... 
 They didn't say why. 
 I don't think I can. Maybe I'm bad. 
 Maybe I'll kill a bunch of people. 
 You can stop it. 
 I could be responsible for millions of deaths, unless you do something. 
 We got a lot to do today. 
 It's all right, Tom. I don't mind. 
 Come on. Take the needle. 
 Come on, Tom. 
 Do it. 
 Do it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't find it. 
 I know you're listening. 
 I know you put it somewhere inside of me. 
 I'm gonna find it. 
 I can't find it. 
 I can't find the bug. 
 I can't find it. I can't find the bug. 
 I know you put it inside me somewhere. 
 I know you're listening. I'm gonna find it. 
 I'm gonna get an x-ray of my whole body. 
 Maia's it! Maia's it! 
 I'm gonna get you, Amy! No, you won't. 
 Yes, I will. 
 Maia. 
 Maia, are you all right? It hurts. 
 I can help you. 
 It's just a bump, Shawn. 
 I can make it better. 
 Oh, that hurts. You're getting better. 
 Hey, let her go! You're hurting her! 
 Somebody help! 
 Let go! Help! 
 What's going on? He's killing her! Get him away! 
 Mister Farrell, let go. 
 Stay away from her! 
 Stand back. I don't understand. I was healing her. 
 What happened? I was making her better. 
 Sweetheart. 
 Hey, Mom. How are you doing? 
 I'm okay. Maia's vital signs are fine. 
 There's no lasting damage that I can detect. 
 At the moment, she's mostly just dehydrated. 
 Sweetheart. 
 Mommy? What is it? 
 Why would Shawn hurt me? 
 Oh, my God. Shawn did this? 
 He missed some meetings yesterday, but I had no idea it had gotten this bad. 
 How's Shawn? Is he okay? We don't know. 
 We called a psychiatrist for him. They're back in the bedroom now. 
 I wanna see him. He'll feel better. Isabelle, not right now. 
 Let him meet with the doctor for a while, okay? 
 Sorry. 
 This is my daughter Isabelle. Isabelle, this is Tom Baldwin. 
 Hi. Shawn told me about you. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 You're staring at me. Why? 
 How is he? 
 I gave him a sedative. He's sleeping right now. 
 Shawn is experiencing persistent and powerful auditory hallucinations. 
 They're contributing to his delusions. 
 Delusions? I don't understand. What's happening to him? 
 Shawn's symptoms are... 
 Well, I'm afraid they're consistent with the onset of disorganized schizophrenia. 
 But you're gonna fix him, right? You're gonna make him better? 
 Well, I've never seen a case quite like this. 
 Typically, schizophrenia has a gradual onset. 
 Patients slowly withdraw from the world as their symptoms get worse. 
 But with Shawn, it's almost as if the disease was just turned on. 
 Last week, we got a phone call from Daniel Armand. 
 He said if we weren't willing to reach a compromise with Nova, he'd come gunning for Shawn. 
 And now it's two days later, and he just happens to come down with schizophrenia. 
 You think the Nova Group did this to Shawn? 
 Well, we'll investigate it, but until the matter's cleared up, Shawn just can't walk around free. 
 I mean, okay, he's probably a victim in this, but his mental state has been compromised. He can't control his ability. 
 Shawn is one of the leaders of this place. 
 People love him. 
 If he just disappears into the basement at NTAC, there's gonna be a lot of unhappiness here. 
 Nobody's talking about disappearing anyone. 
 You need to just distance yourself from the situation. Just for a second. 
 Now, we have an insane 4400 with a potentially lethal ability. 
 This is an ability that he has turned against my daughter. 
 If you don't voluntarily remand him to a psychiatric hospital, then I'll file a complaint for assault and take the decision out of your hands. 
 No! 
 You can't lock him up. This isn't his fault. 
 Isabelle, Shawn is in trouble. He needs help. 
 I know he does, and instead, you just want to abandon him. 
 He sacrificed for this place. He told you not to talk to Nova, even if it meant they were gonna come after him. 
 Now they did and you cut him loose? We're not cutting him loose. 
 We are protecting him. Oh, by locking him up? 
 I guess it's fine for you, right? Isabelle, that is not true. 
 And we are not having this discussion now. This is not the place. 
 If you'll agree that Shawn goes nowhere near a government facility, we'll commit him to a private hospital until all this is cleared up. 
 How much did they tell you about what I do here at the school? 
 Not much. You're some sort of guidance counsellor, right? 
 Something like that. It's more like a therapist, I guess you could say. 
 I work with the students here using my ability. 
 All the kids here are 4400s, which means you missed years of your family's lives. 
 Your parents had another child while you were gone. 
 Your brother, Curtis? Yeah. 
 Before they got divorced. I barely know him. 
 That's where I come in. 
 It's hard to explain, but if you let me, I can take you back to the years when you were gone. 
 You can meet your brother when he was baby, see him grow up, and spend all the time you need with him, and build the relationship you don't have. 
 I'm sorry. What? You wanna take me back in time? 
 No. We'll be going to a world we create using both our minds. 
 And it will seem just as real as this one. 
 Look, no of fence, but maybe you should worry about helping yourself. 
 You think I need help? 
 You have this sadness inside you. 
 Not sadness exactly. 
 I guess rage would be the best word. 
 It's because of what happened to your husband and son all those years ago. 
 You know about Billy and Paul? 
 They got killed in a hit-and-run. 
 The police never caught the guy. 
 You try to move on... 
 ...and I guess you kind of have. 
 But you still think about it every day. 
 And there's still that rage. 
 How do you know all that? 
 You have an ability, and I have an ability. 
 Look, I'm sorry. I'm just not up for this. 
 So is it okay if I go back to class? 
 You're right to be mad, you know. 
 The guy? The driver? He's kind of out there. 
 It's not fair. 
 But you did see Shawn Farrell on Tuesday? 
 A home loan from the Center. And how did the meeting end? 
 Oh, well, congratulations. That's a really nice neighbourhood. 
 No, no, Mister Donavan. Thanks for your time. 
 We'll be in touch if we need anything further. 
 You know, your nephew is one of the leaders of the Center. 
 He sees dozens of 4400s every day. 
 And the ones that we've spoken to who have registered abilities with us, they have minor stuff. Nothing like the capacity to induce insanity. 
 And that's assuming that whoever did this had to be in proximity to Shawn to make it happen. 
 Whoever? 
 We basically know who did this. It was Daniel Armand. 
 Either he did it, or he gave the order. 
 Well, no, the truth is we don't actually know that Shawn's condition is the result of an attack. 
 Nova's not claiming credit, and Shawn's exactly the right age for onset of schizophrenia. 
 So it's possible that we're looking for a crime, and the only thing we're gonna find is a tragedy. 
 Then there's nothing we can do. 
 I cannot accept that. 
 Nova threatened Shawn. Shawn got sick. 
 For right now, that's all the cause and effect I need. 
 You're Zachary? 
 Thanks for meeting me out here. It's all right. 
 Matthew said you had something you wanted to discuss. 
 About six weeks ago, a friend of mine from quarantine, she asked me to meet her for dinner. 
 Sol go, and she's asking me all sorts of questions. 
 Now, she never came right out and said it, but I swear she was feeling me out to see if I would join the Nova Group. 
 She was recruiting you? 
 I mean, she used to bitch about the government all the time. 
 I guess she just finally got fed up. Zachary. 
 If you got a name, give it to me. 
 Jane Nance. 
 Thank you for coming forward. 
 Hi. 
 Todd? 
 Ms. Mareva. What's up? 
 Those things you said about me. They're very private. 
 How did you know? 
 Sometimes, when I'm talking to somebody, if they feel something real strong, I feel it too. 
 And then I know why they feel that way. 
 I see it. 
 So you saw what happened to my family? 
 Not the whole thing. I just get, like, fragments. 
 I saw the two cars hit. I saw this guy. 
 There were empty beer bottles by his seat. 
 He thought about getting out. 
 Calling the cops. 
 I guess he changed his mind. 
 The man who hit them, you know who he is? 
 Yeah, I already wrote it down. 
 I figured you'd want it. 
 "Keane Driscoll." 
 Security told me you were up here. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm packing Shawn's stuff. I'm taking him out of the hospital. 
 Isabelle, I have to caution you against overreaction. 
 I know you're worried about Shawn, but all we have is a tip. 
 We might know the name of one person in the Nova Group. 
 What's my dad gonna do with that? 
 Let me guess, call NTAC? What are they gonna do for Shawn that I can't? 
 They're equipped to deal with 4400s. 
 Not as well as I am. 
 Isabelle. Matthew, get out of my way. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 We don't even know if that tip is any good. 
 And if this woman, Jane Nance, is in the Nova Group, there's no guarantee she's the one doing this to Shawn. 
 If she's not, she'll get me closer to the person who is. 
 She was recruited into Nova, right? So she'll know at least one name. 
 I'll find that person. If they're not the one, they'll know a name too. 
 And eventually, I'll find the person who is hurting Shawn, and I'll make him stop. 
 Wait. Wait a minute. 
 Do you remember the first time I came to see you? 
 You were so sad. 
 You didn't know who you were. Why you grew up so fast. 
 Why you were making your mother so sick. 
 And I told you, you were one of the lucky ones. 
 You have a purpose, a job to do. 
 I even told you what it was. 
 Do you remember? 
 Say it. 
 I'm supposed to eliminate the 4400. 
 That's right. 
 Not everyone from the future thinks they're a good thing. 
 Not everyone thinks they're gonna save the world. 
 All this talk of a catastrophe the 4400 are supposed to prevent, it's lies. 
 They are the catastrophe. All of them. 
 Your father, Shawn... 
 And if he's in trouble, that's good for us. 
 So you keep telling me. 
 Goodbye. 
 No, I can't allow you to do this. 
 You're not ready to be on your own. You need me. You need my guidance. 
 I don't think I do, Matthew. 
 Today's graduation day. 
 Shawn? 
 Isabelle. 
 We have to go now, okay? 
 Isabelle. Isabelle. Okay. 
 My back teeth are melting, and they're gonna run down my throat. 
 I can feel it. 
 It's okay. I'm gonna make you better. 
 Just come with me, okay? 
 Okay? 
 Her name is Jane Nance, and she lives about 20 minutes away. 
 We think the tip is good. 
 If she really is a member of Nova, you can bet she'll be ready to defend herself, so let's be careful. 
 Here you go, Triton. 
 Here you go. 
 You've been a very patient boy. 
 Fidget? 
 What did I tell you about sitting on the TV? 
 Not yet, Herkie. 
 Who are you? 
 We all know what it's like to hit bottom. 
 We wouldn't be here if we didn't. 
 It comes in a different way for each of us, that moment when we realize our drinking is out of control. 
 I'm sorry to interrupt. 
 It's okay. It's okay. Come on in. 
 Grab a seat. 
 I was just saying, my name is Keane, and I'm an alcoholic. 
 Hi Keane. 
 Jane Nance! 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 Get those animals away from her. 
 What the hell happened here? 
 It's like all these pets she keeps, they turned on her. 
 Maybe someone turned them on her. 
 He died very quickly. 
 It could have been a massive stroke, maybe a coronary. 
 I'll call an ambulance and the coroner. 
 Mister Tyler. 
 Those two NTAC agents are here again. They say they need to see you. 
 Look, Mister Tyler, Isabelle broke Shawn out of the hospital. 
 We know that for a fact. 
 And now we learn that Matthew Ross, a 36-year-old man, just happened to die of a stroke on the floor of Shawn's living room. 
 Within the hour, Jane Nance dies as well. 
 I mean, are you telling us that you don't see a connection? 
 You're talking about my daughter. 
 She shouldn't have taken Shawn, I'll admit that. 
 She can be immature sometimes, yes. But she is not a killer. 
 Any idea where Isabelle may have taken Shawn? 
 No. 
 If she calls, I'll try to convince her to come in and I'll let you know. 
 That's the best I can do. 
 Is there anything else? 
 See you. 
 Hey. 
 It's okay to be shy. 
 I remember my first meeting. I didn't say anything either. 
 I was at rock bottom, embarrassed just to be breathing. 
 How long ago was that? 
 About nine years. 
 I was in a car accident. 
 The truth is, I can barely remember it. 
 I came to and I knew I had to change my life. 
 Sol did. I've been leading these meetings for five years now. 
 How about you? You have a moment like that? 
 Diana, we opened a trace on Shawn's cell phone. 
 Richard Tyler's too. 
 If Isabelle calls, we'll be listening. 
 Does this girl scare you as much as she scares me? 
 I mean, never mind what she did or didn't do today. 
 You just meet her. 
 I mean, she looks like a normal kid. Attractive, maybe a bit naive. 
 But when she says something, you realize she's looking at you like you're an ant and she's just deciding whether or not she's gonna rip your legs off. 
 Every other 4400 had a past before they were taken, a history. 
 Not her. 
 She just kind of sprouted. 
 She's not even a 4400. 
 She's something else. A new category. 
 We got a hit on the APB. Shawn's car was spotted headed east on Forbes Avenue. That's in Everett. Let's go. 
 Diana, I need to make a stop at home first. 
 I'm not taking those. I'm not taking those. 
 There's radio antennas inside of there. 
 And that's how they hear what I'm thinking. 
 I'm not taking those. Shawn. 
 Shawn, there are no radio antennas. 
 They're just pills. They make you feel better. 
 The label says you're supposed to take them every four hours. 
 Shawn, stop that. 
 Wait a minute. There he is. 
 It's so late. 
 You scared me. 
 I'm sorry. Someone called in a tip on Shawn's car. 
 It was abandoned, though. He's still missing. 
 Everything okay? Yeah. 
 I don't know. 
 No. 
 A boy at school, he has this gift. 
 He sees things, things that already happened. 
 He says he saw the accident that killed Billy. 
 Oh, my God. Baby. 
 Why would he tell you that? Because. 
 He also gave me the name of the man who did it. 
 I went to see him, Thomas. 
 You did what? 
 He was leading an AA meeting. 
 He told me he had a car accident while he was drunk nine years ago. 
 Alana, sweetie, if this really is the guy, we'll look into it. Based on what? 
 The visions of a 4400 who was a little kid when the accident happened? 
 Alana, please. 
 Don't go see this guy again. It could be dangerous. 
 
 
 
 You should pick up, Thomas. 
 Yeah, but are you sure you're okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Better than your nephew anyway. 
 Baldwin. 
 The place is owned by a 4400 named Jorge Molina. 
 Fire Department found some burnt remains inside. They think it's him. 
 What started the fire? They're not sure. 
 Apparently, Molina had a habit of leaving oily rags laying around the garage. 
 Someone in Health and Safety gave him a bunch of citations for it. 
 Said it was a fire hazard. Guess they were right, huh? 
 Yeah, either that, or Isabelle found the name of another member of the Nova Group. 
 Hello? This will all be over soon, Daddy. 
 Hello? 
 I found out who's doing this to Shawn. It's Daniel Armand. 
 Isabelle? The last Nova I talked to told me. 
 Isabelle. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm just waiting for him to come home, and then I'm gonna make him stop. 
 Isabelle, if you know where Armand is, we'll tell NTAC. 
 They'll take care of it. 
 I'm not stopping. I'm not stopping until Shawn's better. 
 Daddy, when all this is done, can I come home? 
 Will they let me, or am I in too much trouble? 
 Don't know. Maybe. 
 If you stop now, maybe. 
 Just tell me where you're going so I can come meet you. 
 0K3)!- 
 Diana, we just intercepted a call to Richard Tyler's phone. 
 It was Isabelle. Where is she? 
 She's headed to an address in Munhall. 
 She says Daniel Armand is there. 
 You'd better not be hurting him. 
 I'm not. It's almost done. 
 Isabelle. 
 Shawn, are you okay? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 What happened? I don't remember anything. 
 What's Armand doing here? 
 He was hurting you. He broke your mind. 
 That's his ability, but I made him stop. 
 He's yours now. You can do what you want. 
 Now she wants you to kill me. 
 I'm not killing anybody, Isabelle. 
 If you don't, she will. 
 Is that true? 
 I did what I had to do to make you better. 
 What does it matter anyway? You're not sick anymore. 
 I know. I know. Thank you. 
 But it's over. It's over. 
 I'm better. We have Armand. 
 Let's just go. We can walk away. 
 You don't really know this girl at all, do you? 
 You think she's one of us? 
 Don't listen to him, Isabelle. 
 Stop talking. She's not, Shawn. 
 She killed her way across town to find me, and there's no way she's walking away. 
 I said stop talking now. 
 Isabelle, don't. Isabelle, don't. 
 For the record, Daniel, I didn't kill your people. 
 Not exactly. 
 All I did was turn their abilities against them. 
 And what do you do again? 
 Oh, right. 
 You make people crazy. 
 No. 
 Isabelle. 
 Isabelle, stop it! 
 Stop it! 
 They wanna take my organs out. 
 All of them. 
 They're halfway done. 
 They're halfway done. 
 Why did you do that to him? 
 He was still a threat to you, Shawn. 
 If we just left, what's to keep him from attacking you again? 
 Everything I did, I did to make you better. 
 I don't regret any of it. 
 If I had to kill a hundred people, I would have. 
 Who are you? 
 If anyone gets any resistance from the girl or Daniel Armand, do not hesitate to use deadly force! 
 Tom, anything to add? 
 No, let's move. Stop! 
 Can't do that, Mr. Tyler. We need to end this. 
 Look, if you go in there with your guns out, this could end badly for everybody. 
 Let me talk to Isabelle, see if I can get her to come out quietly. 
 You guys have got the place surrounded, right? 
 If I'm gone more than five minutes, you can just come in anyway. 
 Go. 
 Isabelle? Shawn? 
 Richard. 
 You've gotta talk to her. You've gotta talk to her. 
 She wants to fight them. She's gonna get everyone killed. 
 Daddy, we can get past them. You can help me. 
 You can get the guns out of their hands, right? 
 No, Isabelle! We're not here to fight the government. Not today. 
 I don't have a choice. 
 Yes, you do. 
 Walk out there with me. 
 You're gonna get in trouble for breaking Shawn out of the hospital, but we can deal with it. 
 I don't know what happened with Matthew, but we can deal with that too. 
 But if you go after those agents, that is it. 
 You're an enemy of the government. They will catch you eventually. 
 They will put you away forever, I don't care how strong you are. 
 And there won't be anything I can do about it. 
 All this. 
 I did it to save Shawn, and he hates me now. 
 Isabelle. 
 Isabelle, I don't hate you. 
 He's just scared, that's all. We all are. 
 Let's go. 
 They're coming out! 
 Shawn, are you all right? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Daniel Armand's inside. He's all yours. 
 So this is what it feels like to watch someone get away with murder. 
 If there's no evidence of foul play, how can there be a murder? 
 As for the deaths, Shawn doesn't remember anything. 
 There's no witnesses. So officially, we don't have a case. 
 Yeah, but she did it. 
 And I can't help but think when all this is over, she's gonna do a lot more. 
 Their names were Billy and Paul. 
 Paul was my husband. Billy was our son. 
 They were killed in a hit-and-run accident in 1997. 
 The same year you hit bottom. 
 What does this have to do with me? Everything. 
 You killed them. 
 Look... 
 ...I told you before. Nine years ago... 
 ...I was a different man. 
 Something happened. Something... 
 ...terrible. 
 And I had a choice. 
 I could end my life, or I could try to live it better. 
 And I decided to live. 
 And I did do better. I dedicated myself to it. 
 I mean, look around. I help people. 
 You do. 
 And you probably feel like that's enough. 
 I'll bet you, you go days, whole weeks even, without ever thinking about that other man, and what he did. 
 I think about it every day. 
 It never goes away for me. 
 And I'm going to make sure it never goes away for you either. 
 I won't let you forget them. 
 I'm fine, Daddy. They treated me fine. 
 I just need a little time alone, okay? 
 Isabelle. 
 You know, sometime very soon, we're gonna have to talk about Matthew. 
 About all of this. 
 How did you get in here? 
 Shut the door. We need to talk. 
 About what? 
 Some people want me to kill you. 
 I was hoping you could tell me why. 
 Who gave you that? 
 Long story. 
 Let's just say the woman who left it for me, she called you evil. 
 Said if humanity was gonna survive, you had to die. 
 What, you think that's funny? 
 No. 
 It's just it seems like a lot of people have opinions about me. 
 Either I'm the saviour, or I'm the end of the world. 
 It's nice to have options, I guess. 
 That man, Matthew? 
 The one who had a stroke? 
 He came to me right after I grew up. 
 He said I was supposed to do all kinds of things. 
 Destroy the 4400. Kill them all. 
 He told me it was the only way to save the world. 
 I told him no. 
 I might have been conceived in the future, but I'm not their puppet. 
 He didn't like that. 
 He's not around anymore. 
 Neither are those members of the Nova Group. 
 Those people were terrorists. 
 They were murderers. They were hurting Shawn. 
 Look, whoever told you that I'm bad, that I'm some sort of walking Armageddon, is wrong. 
 I turned my back on all that. 
 I'm not a murderer. 
 You know what? I don't care how much I scare you. 
 I don't think you are, either. 
 You don't know me. 
 No? 
 Let's find out. 
 Here I am, the angel of death. 
 The end of the human race, whatever the hell it is they call me. 
 I won't move. I promise. 
 No. 
 Not yet. 
 Not until I'm sure. 
 You're not a murderer. 
 It's okay. 
 You should take that with you in case you change your mind. 
 You better hope I don't. 
 I made that happen, didn't I? 
 No, Todd. I did. 
 I didn't mean to. 
 I didn't want to. 
 But I did. 
 Welcome to Haspel Corp. How may I help you? 
 Hi. I have an appointment with Dennis Ryland. 
 My name's Isabelle Tyler. Oh, Miss Tyler. 
 Mister Ryland's expecting you. 
 Go on up to 24. He's waiting.
