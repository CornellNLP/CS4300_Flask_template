 Shawn 
 Previously on the 4400: 
 Nina 
 (in NTAC)  What?  So, Navarro was really some kind of mind-reader? 
 Diana 
 I believe “telepath” is the word you’re looking for. 
 Navarro 
 (to Tom)  Just concentrate on what you want to ask me, and I’ll hear you. 
 Tom 
 (in a briefing with Nina and Diana)  The guy definitely knew what we were thinking. 
 Nina 
 I could think of a few practical applications for it. 
 Collier 
 (to Navarro in the 4400 Center)  You should have come to me first.  I’d have treated you better than they ever will.  (thinking)  We’re at war here.  Don’t pick the losing side. 
 Kevin 
 (to Tom)  There’s a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400, and they call it “promicin inhibitor.” 
 Tom 
 But NTAC’s been studying the 4400 ever since they got back.  They should have known about this— 
 Kevin 
 They do know. 
 Hudson 
 (in his office, threatened by Diana)  I was ordered to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicin.  Once I synthesized the inhibitor, we gave it to every 4400. 
 Ryland 
 But if it comes down to a choice between the safety of the American people and the welfare of the 4400—Tom—that’s no choice at all! 
 Tom 
 (to Ryland)  If you’re holding on to any hope of keeping this covered up, you’re going to have to start by putting me in the ground right here and right now 
 Marco 
 (during Lockdown)  Every male in this building has got a gallon of adrenaline coursing through his veins right now, and most of them are armed. 
 Tom 
 (after Nina is shot; to Marco outside NTAC)  A 4400 nearly took down a fortified government facility and walked away without breaking a sweat. 
 Lily 
 I wasn’t pregnant when I was abducted, but I was when I got back. 
 Richard 
 (close up of Isabelle; the whirlwind scene in the bookstore)  You’ve seen what she’s capable of, what she can do when she feels threatened.  Did you know Isabelle has connections between the right and left hemispheres of her brain that have never been seen before? 
 Matthew 
 (to Lily)  You are the stewards of the future.  Your daughter is the Rosetta stone for understanding what happened to the 4400. 
 Lily 
 (finding Isabelle’s crib empty)  Isabelle—  (she starts looking for her)  Isabelle! 
 Isabelle 
 (in Shawn’s office, now a grown woman)  Hello, Shawn.  I’m Isabelle. 
 (begin episode) 
 Ryland 
 (in a Congressional hearing, October 13)  The world has changed.  Everything is different now.  The promicin inhibitor program was an international effort.  Its goal was to prevent the coming of a world dominated by a tiny fraction of the population.  In short, we were doing everything we could to prevent the 4400 from developing extra-human capabilities.  We believed that without the inhibitor program these abilities would show up in virtually every single one of the 4400.  (cut scene of Jung Pak, disappeared September 30, 1956, brushing his teeth)  I don’t think I need to explain to this committee why that would be something less than a best-case scenario.  (cut scene to Point Breeze, Washington)  Overnight, normal human beings like you and I and all the institutions we’ve come to rely on would be obsolete.  (cut scene to Tyler Downing, disappeared January 9, 1972, who is watching television; he is able to control electricity power)  The program wasn’t perfect.  People got sick.  Some died.  (cut scene to Auckland, New Zealand; Philippa Bynes, disappeared May 11, 1994, prepares to read in bed; he is able to generate light with his hands)  That was not our intent.  But now, it’s gone, and the future that we were trying to prevent is here, and (with emphasis) we are not ready.  (cut scene to Seattle, Washington; Maia Skouris, disappeared March 3, 1946, is drawing)  I believe it comes down to a question of power.  Who is going to hold it?  Us . . . or them?  Because—believe me—it’s going to come down to us against them. 
 (scene change: three weeks earlier; inside the 4400 Center) 
 Richard 
 (walking through a corridor)  Shawn, you’re not making any sense.  Just tell me what’s wrong with Isabelle. 
 Shawn 
 I told you: I can’t explain. 
 Richard 
 Is she sick?  Is she hurt? 
 Shawn 
 You’ll see for yourself.  (they enter Shawn’s office) 
 Isabelle 
 (standing up with a robe around her naked body)  Dad. 
 Richard 
 Who the hell is this?  Where’s Isabelle? 
 Isabelle 
 I’m your daughter.  I’m Isabelle. 
 Richard 
 (laughs)  I don’t get it. 
 Shawn 
 It’s not a joke. 
 Isabelle 
 Something happened.  I—I changed.  I don’t know how. 
 Shawn 
 She just walked in here.  She knew my name.  She seems to know about you and Lily. 
 Richard 
 Stop.  I don’t know what game you’re playing here, and I don’t care.  (he starts to exit) 
 Shawn 
 Richard.  Richard. 
 (scene change: in Richard’s apartment) 
 Richard 
 (he starts searching for Lily)  Lily.  Lily!  Lily?  Is Isabelle with you?  Lily—(he finds Lily lying on the floor of the bedroom)  Lily!  Are you all right? 
 Lily 
 (aged considerably)  Oh, Richard.  I must have fainted.  Is Isabelle with you? 
 Richard 
 (taken aback)  Who are you?  Where’s my wife? 
 Lily 
 Richard, what are you talking about?  I’m Lily, your wife.  Why are you looking at me like—(she looks down at her hand, which has aged considerably)  Oh, my God. 
 Richard 
 Ma’am, I don’t know who you are. 
 Lily 
 (goes to a mirror hanging on the door and is shocked by her appearance)  Oh, my God!  (screams)  No! 
 (scene change: in Kevin’s office) 
 Kevin 
 (to Lily, after checking her blood pressure)  Your blood pressure is elevated, but I suppose that’s to be expected.  Heart, lungs, reflexes: all within the normal range. 
 Richard 
 Doc, you call this normal? 
 Lily 
 Richard, I want to see Isabelle.  Where is my daughter? 
 Richard 
 She’s right outside.  I’ll bring her in in a minute. 
 Kevin 
 I realize how alarming this must be, but at least you can take some solace in the fact that your wife is a perfectly healthy older woman.  If I had to guess, I’d say she’s about seventy-five. 
 Lily 
 I’m twenty-nine, and I don’t understand.  Please help me understand.  How could this happen? 
 Kevin 
 Maybe it’s a reaction to being taken off the promicin inhibitor.  But truthfully, I don’t know.  There is a condition called progeria.  It’s associated with rapid aging. 
 Richard 
 So, this kind of thing has happened before? 
 Kevin 
 (somewhat exasperated by the events)  Mr. Tyler, when your wife fainted this morning, she was a young woman.  When she woke up less than a minute later, she was fifty years older.  I can guarantee you: this is a first.  (he moves to grab a towel)  Excuse me. 
 Richard 
 Are you okay, Dr. Burkhoff? 
 Kevin 
 Fine.  Not enough sleep, that’s all.  Research. 
 Lily 
 Look.  Well, what do we do now?  Is there any way to reverse this? 
 Kevin 
 (sighs)  I wish I knew.  I need to do some thinking. 
 Isabelle 
 (knocks on the office door and enters, looking at Lily)  Are you my mother? 
 Lily 
 (rises from her chair to confront Isabelle)  Isabelle?  (Isabelle nods; lily reaches out to embrace her) 
 (scene change: present day; still in the Congressional hearing) 
 Ryland 
 Every day, the 4400 are changing and getting stronger.  Instead of mobilizing to meet this challenge, we’re wringing our hands and trying to determine who knew what when.  I will save this Committee the trouble and expense of a long investigation.  The inhibitor program was my idea.  I was proud to lead it.  (cut scene to a white board upon which are pictures and names of men)  The men on this board were simply following my orders.  If there’s blame to be assigned, it’s mine.  Mine alone. 
 (scene change: outside the Congressional chambers) 
 Tom 
 (talking on his cell phone)  Yeah, I know Kyle doesn’t want to see me.  Is there some way we can force him to?  I’m his father.  I want to know how he’s doing.  (listens to an answer)  Look.  I realize you’re trying, but it’ll be months before he goes to trial.  And, I’m not going to wait that long. 
 Diana 
 (to Marco and Nina)  I mean, you really think people are going to let Ryland position himself as some kind of patriotic martyr?  The man headed a conspiracy that caused twenty-eight deaths. 
 Nina 
 Well, he says it was accidental.  A significant percentage of this country believes him. 
 Marco 
 Try “overwhelming.”  You guys listen to talk radio lately?  I mean, the calls are like ninety percent in his favor.  (the women murmur consent)  You can buy a “Free Dennis Ryland” T-shirt within a block of here. 
 Diana 
 (sarcastically)  Maybe they should put him up for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
 Tom 
 (on the phone)  Just tell him I need to see him.  We don’t have to talk about the case.  I just have to see my son.  (he looks desperately at Alana)  Just ask him one more time, okay?  And, tell him we love him.  (he hangs up) 
 Alana 
 Give him some time, Thomas.  Kyle needs to live with his choice for a while. 
 Diana 
 (responding to a chime)  We’re back.  (to Tom)  Tom, break’s over.  (as they all enter the chambers, Tom eyes Ryland and then looks away) 
 Jones 
 Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to call the proceedings to order.  Everyone just take your seats.  We can get started.  Members of the press, I was including you in that “ladies and gentlemen” designation.  Thank you.  (addressing Ryland)  Mr. Ryland, I’d like to pick up the questioning where we left off.  (Ryland nods)  You insist that you alone gave the go-ahead for the promicin inhibitor program.  Is that right, sir? 
 Ryland 
 Yes, sir.  It was my program all the way. 
 Jones 
 So, this Committee is to understand that your department was able to plan and implement an international conspiracy without some cabinet-level approval?  (cut shot to T. J. Kim, disappeared February 2, 1998, who is sitting in the audience, filming) 
 Ryland 
 That’s correct.  I was given a broad mandate in my duties as head of NTAC.  I felt that the project fell within that mandate.  So, there was no need to seek outside approval.  (cut shot to Kim; a whining sound disrupts the proceedings) 
 Jones 
 Excuse us, everybody. 
 Tom 
 (to Diana)  Did you hear that? 
 Diana 
 Well, yeah.  The microphones went haywire. 
 Tom 
 No, no.  Not that.  Something else. 
 Jones 
 Just set that approval issue to the side for the moment.  (the whining sound continues as Tom looks around)  Did you ever discuss the project with anyone outside of NTAC?  I mean, someone, somewhere, just have taken an interest in what you people were doing over there.  (Ryland is consulting with his lawyer who looks very agitated)  It’s a simple question, Mr. Ryland.  Surely it can’t be that difficult to answer.  If I could have your attention up here, Mr. Ryland.  (the lawyer takes a fingernail file from his briefcase and stabs Ryland several times)  Security!  Stop that man! 
 Tom 
 (in the middle of the mayhem, to Diana)  Get some protection around Ryland.  (to Alana)  Stay here.  I’ll be right back. 
 Woman 
 We need an ambulance!  Stand back, please!  Back!  Get back! 
 (scene change: on the street, Tom starts looking for Kim) 
 Tom 
 Hey!  (Kim turns around; the chase begins)  Stop!  (he pulls out his weapon as Kim tries to enter a car)  T. J.!  (he fires, hitting T. J. in the abdomen, but she manages to fall into the car, close the door, and the car speeds away) 
 (scene change: in the Committee chambers) 
 Diana 
 Someone get these photographers out of here.  (she pushes a photographer)  Stay over there. 
 Bright 
 (the lawyer)  I don’t understand what I did.  Would somebody please tell me what I just did? 
 Nina 
 (hovering over Ryland)  Hang on, Dennis.  The ambulance is coming. 
 (scene change: in NTAC’s briefing room) 
 Nina 
 (looking at a picture of T. J. Kim)  Yeah.  It was her.  The blood we picked up at the scene matches the DNA in our records.  That was T. J. Kim running away from the courthouse. 
 Garrity 
 When she hit this place, T. J. drove every man in the building into a homicidal rage.  Now it sounds like she just zapped one guy. 
 Tom 
 She’s learning to control what she can do.  They all are. 
 Diana 
 Ever since we took them off the inhibitor, they’re either developing abilities, or they’re refining the ones that they’ve got. 
 Sid 
 So, they are getting more dangerous.  I guess Ryland was right. 
 Diana 
 (condescending)  I’ll be sure to mention that to my daughter. 
 Nina 
 Save the point-counterpoint.  At the moment, we’ve been tasked with two jobs. 
 Diana 
 We track down T. J. Kim.  What’s the second job? 
 Nina 
 We are to protect Ryland’s co-conspirators from any further reprisals. 
 Tom 
 (voicing the discontent in the room)  So, we arrest them, and now we’re their bodyguards? 
 Nina 
 The entire country just saw a 4400 turn a government hearing into her own personal slasher film.  If T. J. gets to Ryland again—or any of them—before we can bring her in, people are going to wonder if the United States government is capable of protecting its citizens.  And, that’s the beginning of chaos.  Back to work, please.  (all begin to reluctantly return to work; she approaches Tom)  Tom, in case you’re wondering, Dennis is still in surgery.  They say that it is touch and go. 
 (scene change: 4400 Center, outside; Isabelle is walking around and met by stares from the other 4400; cut to Richard’s apartment) 
 Shawn 
 (to Lily)  It’s okay.  Give me your hands.  Try and relax.  Relax.  (he tries to heal her)  Is it better? 
 Lily 
 Much better.  For now. 
 Richard 
 (to Shawn outside in the hall)  When this thing first came on, it was bad, but at least she was healthy.  Now, she’s had diabetes, emphysema—it seems like everyday there’s something new. 
 Shawn 
 I’ll come help her every day.  Listen.  We’ve got everyone working on this.  We’re going to figure it out. 
 Isabelle 
 (approaching)  Is my mother okay? 
 Richard 
 Uh, yeah.  She had a little problem.  Shawn fixed it. 
 Shawn 
 (making light of the situation)  It’s all in the wrists. 
 Isabelle 
 Can I see her?  (when both Richard and Shawn hesitate)  Please?  (she enters the room)  Mom? 
 Lily 
 (lying in bed)  Isabelle!  Come here. 
 Isabelle 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 Lily 
 No.  I’m—I’m fine.  Really.  Sit down.  You were such a beautiful baby.  I used to hold you all day long.  I knew exactly what you were feeling.  What you wanted.  We were so close. 
 Isabelle 
 I’m sorry for growing up so fast.  I didn’t mean to.  I didn’t want to. 
 Lily 
 Neither did I. 
 (scene change: Tom’s home) 
 Tom 
 (to Alana who is opening up a wine bottle)  The crazy thing is: I keep thinking about Patty, Ryland’s wife.  I feel like I should call her or something, help her through this. 
 Alana 
 Maybe you should.  You and Ryland were friends for a long time.  It’s okay to be conflicted. 
 Tom 
 Well, Ryland’s experiment almost got you killed.  Shawn, too.  The guy knew that Kyle was stalking Jordan Collier, and he did nothing.  I’d say that trumps friendship. 
 Alana 
 You have so much on your mind: Kyle, Ryland, the 4400s.  I need to get you away from here, away from your problems. 
 Tom 
 Yeah.  Well, that sounds nice, but I can’t go anywhere.  I’m starting an investigation in the morning. 
 Alana 
 What if I told you I could take you away between now and then?  My ability.  Since I’m off the inhibitor, I think I can control it now. 
 Tom 
 What?  You mean you want to—you want to take me into another dream world?  Alternate reality?  I don’t even know what to call it. 
 Alana 
 Call it a vacation.  A week.  A year.  As long as we want.  All that in the space of a few moments.  Should we try it? 
 Tom 
 Right here?  Now?  Well, what—what do we do? 
 Alana 
 We’re already doing it. 
 Tom 
 (in the alternate reality; he and Alana are in a bungalow overlooking a beach)  There’s no one on the beach. 
 Alana 
 It’s all ours, Thomas.  So’s the hotel.  And, we can stay here for as long as we like.  There is no jet lag. 
 Tom 
 That sounds perfect.  It feels perfect, too.  (they kiss) 
 (scene change: October 14; 4400 Center) 
 Isabelle 
 (responding to a knock on the door)  The door’s open.  Come in. 
 Shawn 
 (entering and seeing Isabelle naked)  Whoa! 
 Isabelle 
 What?  What is it? 
 Shawn 
 Uh, you’re naked. 
 Isabelle 
 I’m more comfortable this way.  I haven’t really gotten used to them: clothes.  I have a bathrobe.  (she puts on a bathrobe)  Is this better? 
 Shawn 
 Almost.  (he ties up her bathrobe)  I never met anybody that read the encyclopedia from cover to cover before. 
 Isabelle 
 Oh.  I’m not finished. 
 Shawn 
 We just delivered those to you yesterday.  Okay.  You’re a fast reader.  That’s really cool.  Um, listen.  They’re looking for you down in the labs.  You’re like an hour late. 
 Isabelle 
 They sent you to get me?  Aren’t you in charge? 
 Shawn 
 Well, yeah.  More or less.  You know.  I go where I’m needed. 
 Isabelle 
 They were scared of me, weren’t they? 
 Shawn 
 Pretty much. 
 Isabelle 
 That’s all right.  I think even my parents are frightened of me. 
 Shawn 
 I don’t think your mom and dad are scared of you.  I think they’re just confused. 
 Isabelle 
 I don’t blame them.  It’s mostly how I feel, too.  I—I don’t understand what happened to me.  I don’t understand what happened to my mother.  And, I’m trying to read and learn things, but mostly, I just—I still feel lost. 
 Shawn 
 See, now you sound like a real 4400. 
 Isabelle 
 But I’m not a 4400, not like my mother and father—or you. 
 (scene change: in the hospital, Ryland’ room) 
 Ryland 
 (to Tom)  Looks like I’m going to live.  Sorry to disappoint you, Tom. 
 Tom 
 Why’d you ask to see me, Dennis? 
 Ryland 
 I hear that you and Skouris are in charge of the investigation. 
 Tom 
 Yeah.  We know who did it.  We’ll find her. 
 Ryland 
 T. J. Kim attacked this building six weeks ago.  No one has tracked her down yet. 
 Tom 
 We got a little sidetracked cleaning up your mess, Dennis. 
 Ryland 
 Did you ever think that maybe she has help?  Other 4400s who feel the same way about the government she does? 
 Tom 
 When we catch her, we’ll ask. 
 Ryland 
 Will you?  I want to make sure you’re going to take this thing as far as it goes, Tom, the same way you did when you came after me.  And, I want my people protected.  They were acting under my orders. 
 Tom 
 They’re under guard. 
 Ryland 
 So was the courthouse when Kim attacked.  I’d feel better if you brought them in. 
 Tom 
 We offered sanctuary to every single conspirator.  There were no takers.  I guess no one wanted to cooperate with the organization that was working to put you in prison.  We had to fight just to get them to let us post agents outside their houses. 
 Man 
 (cut scene to a man wanting to walk his dog)  Crockett!  You ready to go for a walk, boy?  (a dog is reluctant to come)  Come on, Crockett.  Let’s go. 
 Tom 
 (back in the hospital room)  They wanted no part of us.  They all seemed confident that T. J. Kim was acting alone.  (Ryland shakes his head in disagreement) 
 Man 
 (cut scene to the house; the dog starts barking menacingly)  Crockett?  What’s wrong?  (the dog attacks and kills its master) 
 (cut scene: another man—one who’s picture was on the white board—is shown dead while sitting on the toilet; other pictures are being x’d out; the hand circles Ryland’s picture as the next target) 
 Nina 
 This arrived fifteen minutes ago.  (she inserts a disc into a player)  
 Man 
 (voice disguised on the disc)  This is a message from the Nova Group.  We are the defensive wing of the 4400.  Today the world has seen what happens to those who try to harm us.  A second demonstration of our capabilities is planned for October 19th.  A new era dawns. 
 Marco 
 Defensive wing, huh?  What happens when they decide to play offense? 
 Nina 
 I guess we find out in five days. 
 Diana 
 They didn’t even say what they want. 
 Nina 
 No demands, no room for compromise. 
 Tom 
 And, we don’t even know how many 4400s are in this Nova Group. 
 Garrity 
 We couldn’t even handle one when she walked in and attacked the place.  Now there’s a whole team of assassins out there, all with abilities?  They’ve got someone who can kill you by lowering your body temperature. 
 Marco 
 Don’t forget the beastmaster.  What?  That dog got pissed off pretty quick. 
 Diana 
 Well, I’ve been all over the files, and none of these abilities have been registered with us. 
 Tom 
 They’re off the inhibitor now.  We can’t even pretend to have a comprehensive list of what these people can do. 
 Sid 
 Is anyone else feeling . . . a little overmatched here? 
 (later; Tom and Diana meet with Gary) 
 Nina 
 You two remember Gary Navarro? 
 Tom 
 (a little nervous)  Hey, Gary.  (he extends his hand)  Been a while. 
 Gary 
 You’re right, Baldwin.  I do think you two sold me out.  It really bothered me for a while, but now I understand it’s just standard operating procedure. 
 Diana 
 Well, I guess that mind reading thing is working pretty well, huh? 
 Gary 
 Oh, better than ever, actually. 
 Nina 
 Gary’s telepathic abilities have been very useful to the National Security Agency.  They have agreed to let us borrow him while we investigate the Nova Group. 
 Diana 
 So, you’re clear on what we’re doing here? 
 Gary 
 You want to use a 4400 to track down other 4400s. 
 Tom 
 Do you have a problem with that? 
 Gary 
 Not at all.  It won’t be my first time.  (he picks up his jacket)  So, can we get started? 
 (scene change: 4400 Center; Shawn meets with Diana, Tom, and Gary) 
 Shawn 
 Never heard of the Nova Group.  Not until this morning, anyway.  I have to go on television in an hour and explain to everyone that the Center had nothing to do with this. 
 Tom 
 Shawn, I know there’s a lot of history between NTAC and this place, but I trust you realize how serious this is. 
 Shawn 
 Believe me.  If I knew anything I would tell you. 
 Diana 
 Well, do you mind if the three of us walk around the place, talk to some people? 
 Shawn 
 You and your pet mind-reader?  No.  I can’t let you do that.  These people haven’t done anything wrong, and I won’t let you invade their privacy.  (angry)  And, I actually can’t believe that you brought this guy here again.  (to Gary)  How much do they pay you to spy on your own kind?  Getting a clear signal?  You see anything you like up there? 
 Gary 
 (to Tom)  As far as I can tell, he’s not hiding anything. 
 Shawn 
 I have a lot of work to do.  If I hear anything, I’ll give you a call.  (he starts to exit)  For now, that’s the best I can do. 
 (scene change: in the car) 
 Tom 
 (to Gary)  Sorry about my nephew. 
 Gary 
 Why? 
 Tom 
 Well, he was kind of rude back there. 
 Gary 
 I get that kind of stuff a lot.  I don’t take it personally. 
 Diana 
 Do you mind if I ask you: you’ve sort of implied that you’ve pursued 4400s in the past.  What exactly do you do for the NSA? 
 Gary 
 Overseas stuff, mostly. 
 Diana 
 But like what?  Give me an example. 
 Gary 
 They fly me someplace.  I approach the subject, find out what he’s thinking, and I tell the people I work for who then fly me home, where I live comfortably. 
 Diana 
 What happens to the subject? 
 Gary 
 I don’t ask. 
 (scene change: in Kevin’s office; Richard, Lily, and Isabelle are looking through papers) 
 Kevin 
 That’s good.  The neural pathway comparisons are particularly illuminating.  Make sure you understand them before you move on. 
 Lily 
 No.  Dr. Burkhoff, I don’t understand any of this. 
 Isabelle 
 A bunch of her neurons don’t work anymore.  Every time one of hers turns off, one of mine turns on. 
 Kevin 
 Exactly.  And what’s true for neurons is true for muscle fibers, synaptic pathways. . . .  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the amount you lost and the amount you gained. 
 Isabelle 
 So, all this is just a way of saying I’m doing this to her? 
 Kevin 
 The correlation is too precise to be random.  Your rapid aging has caused her rapid aging. 
 Isabelle 
 How do we stop it?  Put me back to the way I was? 
 Kevin 
 I’m afraid I can’t. 
 Richard 
 So, what do we do about it? 
 Kevin 
 There is a possibility that if the aging agent were eliminated that Lily might be restored to her normal self. 
 Richard 
 The aging agent? 
 Isabelle 
 He means me.  I’m killing you.  The only way for you to live is for me to die.  Isn’t that right? 
 Lily 
 Don’t answer that, Dr. Burkhoff.  Thank you for your time.  But, we’re done here. 
 Isabelle 
 Where are you going? 
 Lily 
 We’re not discussing this.  Not now.  Not ever.  (she exits with Richard in tow) 
 Isabelle 
 (to Kevin)  It’s true, isn’t it? 
 Kevin 
 I think so.  But it’s only a theory. 
 (scene change: outside a courthouse) 
 Man 
 (to Tom and others)  Guys, I went over this six weeks ago with the men in black. 
 Tom 
 Humor us. 
 Man 
 I went on two dates with T. J. Kim.  I cut it off.  Girl had a lot of baggage. 
 Diana 
 How long ago was that? 
 Man 
 Uh, two months ago.  And, look.  If I’d known there’d be government agents showing up ever other day to ask me about her, I would’ve taken notes.  Hey, so, listen.  All this stuff about October 19th: you guys think it’s serious?  You know, like should I be getting out of town? 
 Tom 
 I don’t think that’s the answer.  As far as we know, you’re as safe here as anywhere else.  (the man leaves on his bicycle)  
 Gary 
 That kid was lying, or at least he wasn’t telling you everything.  The whole time you were talking to him, he was thinking about an address: 331 Reynolds Avenue. 
 (scene change: 331 Reynolds Avenue; Tom bursts in with his weapon ready; other agents search the place) 
 Tom 
 Looks like it’s clear.  Nobody’s home. 
 Diana 
 Nobody’s been home for a while, I’d say. 
 Tom 
 (kneeling)  Look at this.  (he picks up a book) 
 Diana 
 It’s the government report on the return of the 4400. 
 Tom 
 I tried to read this once.  Kind of dry.  (he hands the book to Diana) 
 Diana 
 (leafing through the book)  Yeah.  Looks like someone made it right through to the end.  (reads a name)  Wesley Hauser.  (she finds the name highlighted on other pages)  Wesley Hauser.  Wesley Hauser. 
 Tom 
 Who the hell is Wesley hauser? 
 (scene change: in Nina’s office; a video tape of Wesley inside the detention center) 
 Nina 
 Hauser was a marine.  Did two tours of duty in Vietnam.  He led protests against the war after he got home in ’72.  Disappeared in ’75. 
 Tom 
 Once he got out of quarantine, he never checked back in with us.  The guy’s been living off the grid for almost two years. 
 Diana 
 Which means, he never went on the inhibitor.  So, who knows what he’s capable of by now. 
 Tom 
 Hauser was disillusioned with the government before he disappeared, and I wouldn’t say we’ve done much to win him over since he’s been back. 
 Diana 
 When he was in quarantine, he was housed in Barracks 3, same building as T. J. Kim. 
 Nina 
 An agitator.  An organizer.  A radical.  Sounds like we have our second member of the Nova Group. 
 Tom 
 (picks up the phone)  Baldwin.  You’re kidding me.  All right.  I know.  Put him through.  (to the others)  Says he’s Wesley Hauser. 
 Diana 
 (whispering)  No way. 
 Tom 
 (puts the phone on speaker phone)  Yeah. Hello. 
 Wesley 
 How’d you like my apartment? 
 Tom 
 Well, to be honest, it felt a little empty without you there. 
 Wesley 
 I’m on a tight schedule.  Lots to do before next week. 
 Tom 
 Sounds like you have interesting plans.  So, why don’t we get together some place, talk them over? 
 Wesley 
 No more talking.  There’s nothing to say.  Your time is ending.  Ours begins on October 19th. 
 (scene change: on the street; Dante Ferelli, disappeared December 24, 1987, is being accosted) 
 Dante 
 Come on.  Let me go! 
 Tom 
 Why did you run when we asked you about Hauser, huh?  You two used to eat together in quarantine.  We’ve got it on camera. 
 Dante 
 So?  The guy had a lot of good war stories.  Doesn’t make us best friends. 
 Diana 
 So, why did you run? 
 Dante 
 Because when I see NTAC agents, I run the other way.  You people almost killed us all.  Can you blame me? 
 Tom 
 Turn around.  Turn around.  (he clips the plastic handcuffs off) 
 Dante 
 We done here? 
 Tom 
 Get out of here.  (Dante runs off) 
 Diana 
 Call me sensitive, but I felt like saying to him: “We exposed the inhibitor.  We saved your life.” 
 Gary 
 (laughs)  You guys just don’t really get it, do you?  It’s not just that guy.  Every 4400 we’ve talked to today: they’re scared of you.  Or, they don’t trust you.  Or, they hate you.  Look.  I’m sorry, but the days when you could expect friendly conversation from these people: they’re gone.  You’re the bad guys now.  Get used to it. 
 (scene change: Diana’s apartment; Maia is playing the Game of Life with Marco and Diana) 
 Marco 
 I’m just warning you: motherhood’s no cakewalk. 
 Diana 
 Since when are you an expert? 
 Marco 
 I’m only saying, she landed on twins.  Kind of a big responsibility, especially when she’s trying to get by on a teacher’s salary. 
 Diana 
 (to Maia)  What are you going to name them? 
 Maia 
 I don’t really want to play anymore.  Is that okay? 
 Diana 
 What’s wrong, Sweetheart? 
 Maia 
 Nothing, except I know Marco’s going to win.  I’m going to come second, and you’re going to end up alone with no money.  Don’t be jealous.  He’s smarter than you, but mom likes you better.  (she retreats to her room) 
 Marco 
 So—uh—who’s—who’s smarter than me? 
 Diana 
 Who knows?  I’m not even sure she knows exactly. 
 Marco 
 You know, in some ways, she was better off on the promicin inhibitor.  At least, she wasn’t overwhelmed back then. 
 Diana 
 All she wants to do is record what she sees in those notebooks.  It’s like some kind of compulsion.  (she starts to clean up) 
 Marco 
 (helping)  Well, think about it for a minute.  Every morning, she wakes up and knows pretty much what’s coming.  She’s already lived the whole day once in her head, and by the time something actually does happen, it’s like a rerun. 
 Diana 
 I hate watching reruns. 
 Marco 
 Yeah.  Try living one.  Hey, what about Kevin Burkhoff?  Maybe he can figure out a way for Maia to control her visions. 
 Diana 
 He is brilliant. 
 Marco 
 I don’t say this about too many people, but he is smarter than I am. 
 (scene change: Burkoff’s apartment; Diana knocks on the door) 
 Kevin 
 I know you. 
 Diana 
 Well, of course you do.  It’s Diana Skouris. 
 Kevin 
 You work at NTAC. 
 Diana 
 I’m not here on business, though.  I’m here about my daughter, Maia. 
 Kevin 
 The precog.  What about her?  She’s still ten, right.  She’s not sixty-five now, is she? 
 Diana 
 Interesting guess.  Kind of wide of the mark, though. 
 Kevin 
 Good.  (sighs; closes the door, then allows Diana to enter)  Might as well come on in. 
 Diana 
 Thank you.  (she almost slips and falls) 
 Kevin 
 Oh, sorry about the clutter. 
 Diana 
 That’s all right.  
 Kevin 
 I fired the maid last week.  She was always cleaning.  (he picks up a hypodermic syringe containing some yellow liquid and puts it in a drawer)  Excuse me.  So, your daughter.  What’s troubling her? 
 (scene change: October 15; in Richard’s apartment; he is preparing Lily’s medicine; he gets so angry that his mind causes things to fly around the room and crash into walls and such; he looks in on Lily) 
 Isabelle 
 (to Richard)  I’ll let you do it.  I caused all this, right?  And getting rid of me is the only way to save my mother. 
 Richard 
 No. 
 Isabelle 
 That’s what you were thinking, wasn’t it? 
 Richard 
 Shhh.  It wasn’t. 
 Isabelle 
 I don’t want her to die either.  So, I’ll let you do it.  I’ll—I’ll even shut my eyes. 
 Richard 
 Isabelle, I would never hurt you.  (he leads her to the sofa) 
 Isabelle 
 Why?  I don’t understand.  It’s the only way to save her. 
 Richard 
 We don’t know that, and I won’t make a choice between the two of you. 
 Isabelle 
 Won’t or can’t? 
 (scene change: inside NTAC; Diana enters her office to find Gary waiting) 
 Gary 
 Sorry.  I don’t mean to invade anyone’s space. 
 Diana 
 Oh, that’s okay.  It’s not my desk.  But it looks like you’ll be here for a while now, huh? 
 Gary 
 Well, assuming this place is still standing on October 20th, yeah. 
 Diana 
 Maybe we should talk to Jarvis.  Get you a room of your very own. 
 Gary 
 That’s fine with me.  To tell you the truth, I could use a little bit of a buffer zone.  This—uh—problem you’re having with your daughter’s—precog ability?  I keep wanting to give you my opinion, but I don’t want to intrude. 
 Diana 
 So, you are listening to my thoughts. 
 Gary 
 You and Baldwin.  I can’t help it.  Uh, I try to tune you guys out, but every now and then, something leaks through. 
 Diana 
 I’ll try to keep that in mind.  You said you had an opinion about Maia.  What is it? 
 Gary 
 When I first developed this thing of mine, I was a basket case.  You saw me.  I truly thought I was going insane, so I fought against it.  And, that just made it worse.  I had to give in to it, let it take control of me, and then, slowly, I learned how to take control of it.  Listen.  Your kid stops fighting, and eventually it’ll become like seeing or hearing or any other sense.  She won’t even think about it.  It’s just a part of who she is.  That’s how it worked for me, anyway. 
 Diana 
 Thank you. 
 Tom 
 (entering)  Diana.  We just got a call form the Seattle police.  Someone down there read our APB.  They know exactly where Hauser is.  (he and Diana quickly exit) 
 (scene change: Seattle police department) 
 Woman 
 You guys are lucky, actually.  In another day or two, we would have buried him in Potter’s field. 
 Tom 
 Buried who? 
 Woman 
 Him.  (she leads them into a morgue)  I always read the APB memos when they circulate in the police department.  Kind of a hobby.  Gets boring in here.  Anyway, there was a description of a regimental tattoo on the memo for Hauser: 82nd Airborne, “Death From Above.”  I remember it from a John Doe they brought in here three weeks ago.  This guy drowned in the harbor. 
 Diana 
 Well, a lot of veterans have that tattoo. 
 Woman 
 Do a lot of veterans look exactly like the mug shot you circulated?  Don’t believe me?  Take a look for yourselves.  (she opens the body bag)  Say hello to Wesley Hauser. 
 (scene change: later, Tom and Diana talk) 
 Tom 
 Hauser died two and a half weeks before Ryland was attacked.  Obviously, that wasn’t him on the phone the other day. 
 Diana 
 And that copy of the 4400 report with all his notes over it?  For all we know, that could have been a plant.  Somebody wanted us distracted.  They deliberately put us on the trail of some phantom member of the Nova Group.  I mean, how did we first find out about Hauser? 
 Tom 
 T. J.’s old boyfriend.  He gave us the address. 
 Diana 
 No.  He was thinking it. 
 Tom 
 At least, according to Gary he was.  Gary Navarro put us onto Wesley Hauser.  (cut scene of Gary walking down the police department corridor) 
 (scene change: a car pulls up on a street; Daniel Armand, disappeared July 20, 1990, rolls down a window) 
 Daniel 
 (to Shawn)  Get in. 
 Shawn 
 You lied to me, Daniel.  You never said anything about killing people. 
 Daniel 
 Oh, we were protecting you, Shawn.  Now, if we tell you in advance, you’re culpable.  (T. J. Kim whimpers in the back seat from the gunshot wound) 
 Shawn 
 What is she doing here? 
 Daniel 
 She’s dying.  She needs your help. 
 Shawn 
 I told you: I don’t want anything more to do with you.  The Nova Group was supposed to protect us.  That’s why I gave you money, Daniel.  (angry)  That’s why I gave you money.  Not to start a terrorist organization. 
 Daniel 
 We’ll talk about your concerns later.  She’s got a stomach wound, and it’s infected.  She needs you right now, or she’s not going to make it.  Shawn, she’s a 4400.  If we don’t help each other, what hope do we have? 
 Shawn 
 (turning around in his seat; to Kim)  Give me your hand. 
 (scene change: in the 4400 Center, Richard’s room; Lily lies down on the couch, her head in Richard’s lap; Isabelle is on the roof and jumps; security find her and call 911) 
 (scene change: in Ryland’s hospital room; Gary prepares to kill Ryland) 
 Ryland 
 What are you doing here? 
 Gary 
 You’re awake.  Good.  It’s important that you know it was me.  I’m the guy who killed you.  (Ryland starts to convulse) 
 Radio 
 Med post.  Do you have a 20 on Gary Navarro? 
 Officer 
 Yeah.  He just walked by.  Why? 
 Radio 
 Get him! 
 Officer 
 Hey!  Stop!  (Gary starts to run; to his partner)  Go!  I’ll check on Ryland. 
 Nurse 
 He’s seizing.  He’s Bradying down.  I need a crash cart and ativan.  Find Dr. Danoff.  Now!  [Bradying down = Heart rate is dropping; Ativan is used to treat anxiety disorders] 
 Nina 
 (Gary is trapped and throws up his hands)  Stay right there, Gary. 
 (scene change: 4400 Center, outside; people gather to gawk at Isabelle lying on the ground) 
 Richard 
 Isabelle!  Isabelle!  Oh, God!  Somebody call an ambulance!  What’s everybody standing around for?  Somebody call an ambulance! 
 Man 
 They’re on their way!  (Isabelle’s eyes open) 
 Richard 
 (unaware of Isabelle standing up)  Somebody call an ambulance. 
 Isabelle 
 Dad?  (Richard hugs her)  What am I? 
 (scene change: in the car) 
 Daniel 
 It’s miraculous, Shawn.  I watch you heal someone, and it makes me wonder why they hate us so much. 
 Shawn 
 They hate us because you’re killing them, Daniel.  They’re afraid of us.  I can’t blame them. 
 Daniel 
 You make it sound like we acted out of some sort of blood lust.  These were precise, tactical strikes, Shawn.  And, you and every other 4400 are ultimately much safer because of them. 
 Shawn 
 You killed people.  That’s not what we discussed when you approached me.  I gave you money to start a defensive arm for the Center in case the government ever came after us again.  It was a precaution. 
 Daniel 
 And, all we’ve done is taken precautionary measures.  Shawn, do you think that because their inhibitor program was exposed that the government’s just going to leave us in peace?  No.  They know we’ve gotten stronger, which threatens their hold on power, which increases their need to eliminate us. 
 Shawn 
 So, we strike first?  Is that it?  Is that what happens on the 19th? 
 Daniel 
 Look, Shawn.  You do great work at that Center of yours.  You just focus on that.  I don’t want to distract you.  Knowledge can be a burden.  And thanks for helping T. J. out.  You’re a hero to your own people.  Never forget that. 
 Shawn 
 (resigned)  Yeah.  (he exits from the car) 
 (scene change: NTAC interrogation work) 
 Tom 
 (to Gary)  It did not work, you know.  Ryland was ODing, but the doctors pulled him out of it.  He’ll be awake within a couple of hours. 
 Gary 
 Well, I’m sure you’re as disappointed as I am.  Don’t worry.  We’ll get him. 
 Diana 
 Let’s talk about Wesley Hauser.  You first met him in quarantine. 
 Gary 
 I liked Wes.  He was ten kinds of crazy, but his heart was in the right place.  I guess he was bipolar or something, but he never took medication.  After quarantine, he lived on the streets.  I used to visit him down at the docks.  You know, give him food, a little money. 
 Tom 
 So, when did you decide to kill him? 
 Gary 
 Wes, he didn’t need my help with that.  He drank about three bottles of Mad Dog a day.  One morning about a month ago, I went down to see him, and—uh—I found him by the dumpster.  Dead. 
 Diana 
 And, somewhere in the middle of your grieving process, you figured he’d make a handy decoy. 
 Gary 
 No.  Hauser wouldn’t have minded.  I mean, he hated people like you, going back to his Marine Corps days.  So, when I found him, I said a word or two over his body, and I pushed him into Elliott Bay. 
 Tom 
 So, how long have you been working with this Nova Group?  Did someone approach you, or was the whole thing your idea? 
 Gary 
 Tell me: you and this girlfriend of yours: is it like a role-playing thing you get up to?  Or, is she actually taking you into these—I don’t know.  What do you call it?  Fantasy worlds?  Oh, and this guy, Marco: does he know that you’re too embarrassed to tell your partner that you two have been dating? 
 Tom 
 Done showing off?  Why don’t you tell us what’s going to happen on October 19th? 
 Gary 
 I guess you’re going to have to find yourself another telepath.  Good luck with that. 
 (scene change: Nina’s office) 
 Nina 
 So, you got nothing out of him? 
 Diana 
 Well, he told us about Hauser, but as far as the Nova goes, it’s going to take time to break him down. 
 Nina 
 How much time? 
 Tom 
 He’s a telepath.  He knows what we’re thinking. 
 Diana 
 A little longer than usual. 
 Nina 
 Okay.  So, it’s not easy, but Gary Navarro has a level-seven security clearance.  We have to assume that he’s been using it to funnel national secrets to the Nova Group.  We need to know what he knows.  Now! 
 Tom 
 He’ll talk.  Gary’s been inside our heads for a year.  I think I know how to get inside of his. 
 (scene change: 4400 Center; Matthew exits from a limousine) 
 Matthew 
 (handing his briefcase to an attendant)  Careful with this. 
 Shawn 
 (greeting him)  Matthew.  I didn’t expect to see you back for a couple of weeks. 
 Matthew 
 The Nova Group revised my calendar for me.  Wiped it clean, actually.  It’s difficult to lobby on behalf of the 4400 when some of them are boasting about their body count. 
 Shawn 
 I suppose. 
 Matthew 
 How’s Lily?  Any improvement since I left? 
 Shawn 
 If anything, she’s getting worse. 
 Matthew 
 I’m sorry to hear that.  Isabelle? 
 Shawn 
 She tried to kill herself this morning.  She jumped off the roof.  A few minutes later, she was walking around like nothing happened.  I got to tell you, Matthew, I’m not going to lie.  I’m really glad you’re back. 
 (scene change: Isabelle’s room; she tries to burn her hand over a candle; she heals quickly) 
 Matthew 
 (knocking on the door and entering)  Hello, Isabelle. 
 Isabelle 
 Hello.  Who are you? 
 Matthew 
 My name is Matthew Ross.  I work closely with Shawn.  I’m an advisor to the 4400.  May I come in?  (Isabelle stands aside, and he enters)  I understand there was an incident this morning.  You attempted to harm yourself.  (Isabelle nods)  I see.  (he slaps her face; yelling)  You had no right to do that!  Don’t you understand who you are?  What you’re here to do? 
 Isabelle 
 (crying)  No. 
 Matthew 
 Well, I do!  I know everything about you, Isabelle.  I know why you’re here, and I know what you’re supposed to do.  (he grabs her and forces her into a chair)  Sit!  And, I’ll tell you a story.  You’ll like it.  It’s about your past, and it’s about your future. 
 (scene change: Diana’s apartment) 
 Diana 
 (to Marco)  I know you went to a lot of trouble to get this.  Thank you. 
 Marco 
 But? 
 Diana 
 I’m not sure I want to send Maia to a school that only teaches 4400s.  It sounds like a great way to get her to withdraw even further from the world. 
 Marco 
 Look.  Just—just pretend it’s got nothing to do with the 4400 for a second.  It’s a good school.  You know.  Top-notch faculty, the facilities are great, and it’s all free.  The 4400 Center picks up the whole tab.  They even have a class on how to manage your abilities. 
 Diana 
 Just give me some time to think about it, okay?  It’s a big step.  I was kind of hoping Dr. Burkhoff would have—I don’t know—a magic pill or something. 
 Marco 
 What’s he working on?  Anything interesting? 
 Diana 
 You know that promicin serum that he invented that saved everybody?  Well, I saw a syringe at his place, and it looked like there was some in it. 
 Marco 
 Well, he’s a researcher, right?  He’s probably injecting it into—what—mice, guinea pigs? 
 Diana 
 The only animals I saw at his place were a couple of cockroaches. 
 Marco 
 You don’t think he’s injecting it into himself, do you?  
 (scene change: Kevin’s apartment) 
 Kevin 
 That’s ridiculous.  I am not injecting myself with the promicin serum. 
 Diana 
 Good.  I’m glad to hear it. 
 Kevin 
 I’m injecting myself with a modified version of the promicin serum. 
 Diana 
 Dr. Burkhoff, I have to ask you this.  Have you stopped taking your medication? 
 Kevin 
 Of course, no.  I’m as sane as you are.  Once the course of treatment is finished, I will have taught my body how to produce promicin, and then I will be the first non-returnee to develop 4400 abilities.  The first of many. 
 Diana 
 You’re talking about the next step in human evolution.  Do you think the world is ready for that? 
 Kevin 
 The world is never ready for change.  You have to force it on them.  Isn’t that why the 4400 were brought back?  Isn’t that why the future woke me up? 
 Diana 
 You shouldn’t be doing research of this magnitude in—excuse me, but—in a dump.  These are hardly sterile working conditions. 
 Kevin 
 You could help me with that.  You have a scientific background, right? 
 Diana 
 I have graduate degrees in microbiology and epidemiology. 
 Kevin 
 Good.  That’ll be handy.  I need someone to monitor my progress as the changes continue. 
 Diana 
 (puzzled)  Changes?  (she recoils from seeing Kevin’s marked body) 
 Kevin 
 I think it’s an exciting first step.  Don’t you? 
 
 
 
 (scene change: Tom’s home; he and Alana are sharing a bath) 
 Alana 
 I was thinking, next time, we could make a world where Kyle never shot Jordan Collier, never went to prison, the inhibitor scandal never happened. 
 Tom 
 Sounds nice.  Although, I have to tell you at the moment, I’m not really feeling the need to be transported to some kind of fantasy world.  As long as this water stays hot, things are A-okay with me right here in reality.  Maybe tomorrow we can try it again. 
 Alana 
 I’ll take a rain check.  I’m going to a seminar at the 4400 Center tomorrow.  (Tom looks at her oddly)  It’s about what we can expect physically now that we’re off the inhibitor. 
 Tom 
 Is everything okay?  I mean, you’re not having any problems, are you? 
 Alana 
 No.  I feel fine.  I feel great, actually. 
 Tom 
 Well, then, I don’t get it.  Why do you need to go? 
 Alana 
 I don’t.  I want to go.  I’m curious. 
 Tom 
 But, Alana, you never—you never wanted to go to the Center before.  Why start now? 
 Alana 
 I never felt the need to be around other 4400s before. 
 Tom 
 Now, you do? 
 Alana 
 It’s just a seminar, Thomas. 
 Tom 
 (resigned)  Yeah.  Okay.  I get it. 
 (scene change: October 16; inside an NTAC interrogation room) 
 Tom 
 (to Gary)  Do you recognize those names?  They’re 4400s: all of them foreign nationals.  Alessandro Ortiz from Venezuela.  Ismael Namir from Libya.  Chitra Singh from Indonesia.  They’ve all gone missing in the past year. 
 Diana 
 That’s one year.  Now, that’s about as long you’ve worked for the NSA, isn’t it, Gary?  We checked your travel records.  You left Venezuela two days before Ortiz disappeared. 
 Tom 
 Same thing in Libya, Indonesia—everyone on that list.  You were there; they went away.  
 Diana 
 What exactly did you do for the NSA, Gary? 
 Tom 
 There’s an arms race going on, isn’t there?  Only now it’s with 4400s.  These people: I bet their abilities make the wrong people very nervous. 
 Diana 
 And the NSA couldn’t stand by while foreign—and potentially hostile—governments developed—what?—human weapons of mass destruction? 
 Tom 
 Is this list complete?  ‘Cause I’m just wondering how many 4400s you did kill. 
 Gary 
 I did not kill anyone. 
 Tom 
 Oh, no, no, no.  You just got the right people in the right zip code.  Because you—you were living back home.  (to Diana)  What did he say?  Oh, yeah.  “Very comfortably” when the actual dirty work was done. 
 Diana 
 And, that’s why you went across to the Nova Group, isn’t it, Gary?  Because you just couldn’t live with yourself. 
 Gary 
 The NSA told me that I was helping my country.  They didn’t fill in the blanks.  I had to do that myself. 
 Tom 
 You felt used.  They made you a weapon against your own people.  So, when did you figure it out?  (the door buzzer interrupts Gary’s response; two people enter)  What’s up?  Who are these guys? 
 Nina 
 This is Agent Wood and Dr. Boll of the NSA.  They’ve been brought in to help expedite the interrogation. 
 Wood 
 (unhandcuffs Gary and thrusts him up against the wall)  Okay, first of all, no more sitting. 
 Tom 
 What’s going on?  Brought in by who? 
 (scene change: in Ryland’s hospital room) 
 Ryland 
 Gary Navarro tried to kill me.  I made a phone call. 
 Tom 
 You should be in jail right now, Dennis. 
 Ryland 
 I still have a few friends, Tom. 
 Tom 
 I had him talking.  I was making progress. 
 Ryland 
 Not fast enough.  The members of Gary’s cell know he’s been taken.  They’re already changing their plans.  If it takes too long to break him, the information he gives us is stale.  October 19th is three days away. 
 Tom 
 Yeah. 
 Ryland 
 I know you find this hard to believe, Tom, but we’re on the same side.  We have the same goal.  Those agents are tools.  Use them. 
 (scene change: 4400 Center, outside) 
 Isabelle 
 (to Shawn; she carries a number of books)  You’re sitting in my spot. 
 Shawn 
 Sorry. 
 Isabelle 
 It’s okay.  There’s room for two people to sit.  (she puts her books down, selects one, and sits down) 
 Shawn 
 (looking through her stack of books)  You got Stalin, Pol Pot, and the Marquis de Sade?  Did you finish all the fun books? 
 Isabelle 
 Well, I’m interested in learning more about evil.  Everybody’s scared of me.  So, I thought: “What if they’re right?  What if I’m bad?” 
 Shawn 
 Why would you think that? 
 Isabelle 
 Sometimes I think I feel it inside of me, like I could be capable of anything. 
 Shawn 
 Everyone’s capable of anything.  Believe me.  I know. 
 Isabelle 
 How?  Have you done bad things? 
 Shawn 
 Yeah.  Of course, I have. 
 Isabelle 
 Will you tell me about them? 
 Shawn 
 Um, okay.  I slept with my brother’s girlfriend. 
 Isabelle 
 How bad is that? 
 Shawn 
 Some people would call that a major betrayal.  A lot of hard feelings. 
 Isabelle 
 (referring to her current book)  This man did much worse than that. 
 Shawn 
 Well, I’m not a dictator, but I’ve done the big kind of bad, too.  I can’t say much about it, but I gave some money to some people.  They used it for something really, really wrong, and I don’t think that they’re finished. 
 Isabelle 
 Well, can you stop them? 
 Shawn 
 I could turn them in, but the thing is, so far, they’ve only gone after bad people, people that tried to kill me, tried to kill all of us. 
 Isabelle 
 So, if they’ve only gone after bad people, then doesn’t that make them good? 
 Shawn 
 Maybe.  (he shakes his head)  I don’t know. 
 Isabelle 
 (takes his hand)  We’re relating now, aren’t we?  I read about this. 
 Shawn 
 Yeah.  We are.  How was it for you? 
 Isabelle 
 I liked it.  We talked.  It helped me understand good and evil.  According to you, you get to pick.  It’s a choice.  I have it right, don’t I? 
 Shawn 
 Yeah.  You do. 
 (scene change: October 17; Richard’s apartment) 
 Lily 
 I can’t open my hand.  I woke up from a nap, and it was all bunched up like this. 
 Shawn 
 Arthritis I can handle.  (he heals her) 
 Lily 
 That feels good.  You’re like a human heating pad. 
 Shawn 
 I like that.  Human heating pad.  I’ll take it as a compliment.  Seriously, you better? 
 Lily 
 Yeah. 
 Richard 
 (to Lily)  I’ve been trading E-mails with somebody down at the Mayo Clinic.  He says we should go to Sweden and try this experimental treatment. 
 Lily 
 (passes an envelope with a blue ribbon on top)  Here. 
 Richard 
 Uh.  What’s this? 
 Lily 
 Open it.  (he does so)  Can you believe that the Air Force lets you do that now?  You give them some money, and they let you ride along in an F-16. 
 Richard 
 It says here I get to take the controls. 
 Lily 
 Oh, I talked to the guy who was in charge of the program, and I told him about your background as a pilot, and he said he would let you drive for thirty seconds. 
 Richard 
 Lily, I was a pilot in 1950. 
 Lily 
 That’s why it’s only thirty seconds.  (they both laugh)  Happy birthday, Richard. 
 Richard 
 Thanks, but it’s not my birthday for another six weeks. 
 Lily 
 Richard, I’m not going to be here in six weeks. 
 Richard 
 That’s not true. 
 Lily 
 Yes, it is.  You and I have both known for a while.  Richard, I’m dying. 
 Richard 
 Lily, I know how hard this is on you, but you can’t give up.  Shawn said he’s willing to stay here with you all day if he has to.  He’ll keep you healthy. 
 Lily 
 He can’t.  (she shows him her hand)  Not anymore.  (Richard cradles her hand) 
 (scene change: 4400 Center lobby; Maia and Diana enter) 
 Maia 
 Are all these people 4400s? 
 Diana 
 Well, some are, and some just wish they were. 
 Maia 
 Why would they want that? 
 Receptionist 
 Good morning.  Welcome to the Center. 
 Maia 
 Are you a 4400? 
 Receptionist 
 No, Sweetie.  Are you?  (Maia nods)  Well, it is an honor to meet you.  Are you here to take our seminar? 
 Maia 
 No.  We’re here to look at the school. 
 Diana 
 We have an appointment with Ms. Tobey. 
 Receptionist 
 I’ll get here right away.  (to Maia)  In the meantime, would you sign in and register your ability?  We’re creating a database.  (she walks away) 
 Diana 
 You sure you want to do this? 
 Maia 
 (nods)  I want to meet kids like me. 
 (scene change: in the seminar) 
 Alana 
 My name is Alana Mareva.  I have to admit, I was pretty hesitant about coming here today.  I was lucky.  My life was pretty much intact when I was returned.  I never thought much about being a 4400.  But when we all got sick, and seeing everyone together in quarantine, it made me feel like I had been denying a part of myself.  So, here I am, and I’m glad I came. 
 (scene change: Gary’s interrogation) 
 Wood 
 (after dousing Gary with water)  Anything you want to tell me?  Gary—(he sighs)—let’s end this.  I’ll let you sit down.  Who contacted you first?  Just give me a name.  Oh, man.  (he strikes Gary in the abdomen)  So, how about it?  October 19th is two days away.  Now, you got something to tell me or not?  Suit yourself.  (he hits Gary again) 
 (scene change: Daniel is talking on his cell phone) 
 Daniel 
 One of our members has been compromised.  I have to assume he’s going to give up my name. 
 Shawn 
 So, you call me?  For all I know, NTAC is monitoring this line. 
 Daniel 
 Well, we’re going to have to go underground.  It’s going to cost money. 
 Shawn 
 You think I’m just going to write you a check? 
 Daniel 
 You can arrange it however you want.  I need it tomorrow.  I will see you at the usual spot at the usual time.  We are in a war, and we all have to do our part.  (he hangs up) 
 (scene change: Gary’s interrogation) 
 Wood 
 Talk to me, Gary.  What do you got to say, man?  (angrily)  Talk to me!  Talk to me, Gary!  I need names.  Give me a name!  Talk to me, Gary! 
 Gary 
 Daniel Armand. 
 Wood 
 Daniel Armand.  (Gary nods)  Okay.  It’s a start.  Who else? 
 Gary 
 That’s it.  He was my only contact.  I never met anyone else in the group.  He kept us all separate. 
 Wood 
 I’m sorry.  I’m just having a hard time believing that’s true. 
 Doctor 
 His pulse is tachy at 210.  Systolic’s up to 240.  We need to lay off. 
 Wood 
 We’ve only got one name. 
 Doctor 
 You can’t put him under again, not for a few hours. 
 Wood 
 We haven’t got a few hours.  Don’t worry.  He’s my responsibility. 
 Tom 
 (entering)  No.  He’s not.  He’s ours.  And, he’s done for the day.  (he releases Gary)  It’s okay, Gary. 
 (scene change: in the 4400 Center) 
 Matthew 
 (on the phone)  Okay, he’s back.  It’s not like we weren’t expecting this.  No.  Relax.  He won’t get anywhere near Isabelle.  We’ll find him, and we’ll deal with it.  (a picture of Collier is shown) 
 Isabelle 
 (entering)  You made a mistake.  You’ve got the wrong person. 
 Matthew 
 (on the phone)  I have to go.  (to Isabelle)  I don’t think I do. 
 Isabelle 
 Those things you told me?  Those things you said I’m going to do?  That’s not me.  I have a choice.  And, I don’t know who you are, and I don’t know how you think you know so much about me, but you’re wrong. 
 Matthew 
 Isabelle, I understand why you’re having trouble adjusting.  Growing up is hard.  Don’t be angry at the messenger.  It’s not my plan.  I’m just here to help facilitate.  To help you reach your full potential.  Think of me as a favorite uncle. 
 Isabelle 
 No.  No, I don’t have any uncles.  I don’t have any uncles, and I won’t be a part of any plan. 
 Matthew 
 Fair enough.  You can always opt out.  You can even try saving your mother, if you like. 
 Isabelle 
 How?  (Matthew closes the door, walks to a chest, and withdraws a small case)  What is that? 
 Matthew 
 Open it.  (she complies)  There aren’t a lot of things that’ll hurt you, Isabelle.  But that right there: that’ll do the job.  (she sees a syringe)  If you can’t accept the fact that your life is vastly more important than your mother’s, just give yourself that shot.  You’ll be dead in minutes.  And Lily?  Who knows?  Maybe she’ll wake up and be a young woman again. 
 Isabelle 
 Will it really save her? 
 Matthew 
 I don’t know.  It’s a gamble.  But if you can’t live with who you are, then don’t. 
 (scene change: Kevin’s apartment; he is apparently having trouble with coordination; Diana looks on worriedly) 
 Kevin 
 Sorry about that.  Ah.  Good.  I knew it.  I knew I had a clean cup somewhere.  Now, where are the filters? 
 Diana 
 It’s okay.  I don’t need coffee. 
 Kevin 
 I swear I just saw them.  Do you mind if I just use paper towels? 
 Diana 
 Kevin, if I do this— 
 Kevin 
 “If” you do it?  You’re already doing it.  You’re here, right? 
 Diana 
 If I monitor you throughout this experiment, I need you to know one thing: if it gets to a point where your life is in danger, I am cutting this off.  I will not stand by and watch you die. 
 Kevin 
 Well, I would hope not, because I’m too valuable.  (he laughs)  I think it’s going to be fun.  I haven’t really worked with anyone for quite some time.  I’m looking forward to it. 
 Diana 
 Me, too. 
 Kevin 
 So, want to draw some blood? 
 (scene change: October 18; NTAC corridor) 
 Tom 
 Nina.  We were just downstairs.  The guard on duty said Wood signed Gary out 
 Nina 
 Gary was transferred to an NSA-run facility. 
 Diana 
 But he’s a 4400.  He’s our jurisdiction. 
 Nina 
 And, someone at the Pentagon signed an order overriding us.  Apparently, they feel we lack experience in high-pressure interrogation. 
 Tom 
 And, who do you think put that little bug in their ear? 
 Nina 
 I don’t know if it was Ryland or not, but we had our shot at Navarro.  Now, tomorrow is October 19th.  We are a day away from an announced terrorist attack.  The NSA thinks they can get him to talk. 
 Diana 
 So, where are they taking him? 
 Nina 
 They didn’t share that information. 
 Tom 
 This is so wrong.  This is the only place in the country that’s at least somewhat equipped to handle 4400s. 
 Nina 
 Do you think that I didn’t tell them that?  They weren’t interested. 
 (scene change: Isabelle’s apartment; she watches Richard load up his car; someone knocks on her door) 
 Lily 
 Isabelle. 
 Isabelle 
 Hi. 
 Lily 
 May I come in?  (she enters) 
 Isabelle 
 Are you going somewhere?  I saw Dad putting luggage into his car. 
 Lily 
 Oh, we’re just going to try another clinic, but we will be going away for a while. 
 Isabelle 
 Do you want me to come with you? 
 Lily 
 No.  It’s all right.  Thank you.  Now, if there’s anything that you need, you talk to Shawn.  He’s—he’ll be looking out for you.  Okay?  And—uh—I want to give you this.  (she removes a ring from her finger)  It’s my wedding band.  I inherited it from my grandmother.  Her name was Lily, too.  You used to love to play with it when you were a little baby. 
 Isabelle 
 I remember.  I used to like to bite on it. 
 Lily 
 And my finger, too.  You can wear it if you want.  I always knew that I would give it to you one day.  It doesn’t fit me anymore, and I’d hate to lose it. 
 Isabelle 
 I’ll keep it safe for you. 
 Lily 
 I know you will.  I’m sorry I have to leave so soon.  I—I wish we had more time together. 
 Isabelle 
 Well, when do you think you’ll be back? 
 Lily 
 It’s hard to say.  Goodbye, Isabelle.  (they hug) 
 Isabelle 
 Bye.  (Lily exits) 
 Richard 
 (outside, to an aide)  I’ll take it from here.  Thank you.  (he helps Lily to the car)  Okay.  You told her we were going over to the hospital?  (Lily nods)  How’d it go over? 
 Lily 
 0h, fine.  I had it easy.  I—I got to lie.  (Richard opens the door for her)  You’re the one who has to tell her the truth.  (meanwhile, Isabelle pulls the box with the syringe out of a drawer) 
 (scene change: city of Seattle; Gary is being transported; the van is intercepted) 
 Gary 
 What’s going on?  What’s happening?  (Daniel pulls him out of the van) 
 (scene change: Ryland’s hospital room; Tom enters) 
 Ryland 
 We’ll get him. 
 Tom 
 Funny.  That’s the exact same thing Navarro said about you. 
 Ryland 
 So far, he’s wrong. 
 Tom 
 He never should have been moved in the first place.  There was no reason. 
 Ryland 
 There was every reason.  You’re too soft, Tom.  I don’t know what’s happened to you. 
 Tom 
 (at the top of his voice)  No!  I had him Dennis!  You lost him!  (calming down)  Sunset’s in four hours.  At this point, we can’t even say with one hundred percent certainty that it’s going to rise again in the morning.  And, the one guy who can tell us is gone. 
 Ryland 
 That’s a defeatist attitude.  We’ll get him. 
 Tom 
 Yeah.  I know.  You keep saying that.  (he exits) 
 (scene change: near a park; Shawn waits; T. J. Kim approaches) 
 Kim 
 Hey!  Shawn!  You got something for me? 
 Shawn 
 Where’s Daniel? 
 Kim 
 Busy.  He sent me. 
 Shawn 
 No, no, no.  That’s not how we work. 
 Kim 
 Today, it is.  You can trust me.  You saved my life.  I owe you.  Come on.  Let’s get this over with.  I feel a little naked standing out here.  (Shawn hands her an envelope)  Thanks.  Listen.  If there’s ever anything you need—(she is shot with an anesthetic dart)—you sold us out. 
 Officer 
 (pulling up in a car)  Get in there!  Get in there!  (agents pick up Kim’s unconscious body) 
 Tom 
 (to Shawn)  You okay? 
 Shawn 
 Yeah.  I’m fine.  (to Diana)  I don’t guess we’ll be seeing her in court any time soon. 
 Tom 
 No.  You did the right thing by calling us, Shawn. 
 Diana 
 Seriously.  You’re a hero.  (she and Tom exit) 
 (scene change: October 19; NTAC briefing center) 
 Nina 
 One minute to go.  (to Tom)  Just tell me one thing: are we as prepared as we can be? 
 Tom 
 The entire country is on level red terror alert.  All commercial air traffic has been suspended for the day.  The National Guard has been deployed to likely targets. 
 Nina 
 “Likely targets.”  Kind of a broad term.  I wish T. J. could have narrowed that down for us. 
 Diana 
 Well, me, too.  But we have to keep her sedated to inhibit her ability.  I mean, she’s already turned this place into a war zone once. 
 Nina 
 (nods)  So, now we wait. 
 Garrity 
 Anyone else feel like they’re staring at a doomsday clock? 
 Tom 
 (it is now midnight)  Well, that’s it.  October 19th. 
 Diana 
 Looks like the world’s still here. 
 Nina 
 For the moment, anyway. 
 (later in the day) 
 Woman 
 Oh, my God! 
 Tom 
 What?  What happened? 
 Diana 
 It’s the Nova Group. 
 TV 
 Certainly, “miracle” is an imprecise term, but I’m not sure how else to describe it.  To repeat, I’m broadcasting live from the Nubian Desert north of Khartoum, where overnight, a thousand-acre patch of barren sand has somehow been transformed into fertile wheat fields.  Scientists are at a loss to explain the conversion, but tests confirm that the wheat is real and edible. 
 Nina 
 There hasn’t been food growing in that part of the world before the birth of Christ. 
 Diana 
 They make us all terrified, and then, rather than attacking us, they give us a gift. 
 TV 
 Our station has just received a statement from the radical 4400 organization known as the Nova Group, claiming responsibility for this morning’s transformation. 
 Voice 
 You are witnesses to the beginning of a new era.  What happens next is up to you.  The 4400 can be mankind’s greatest ally or its most dangerous adversary. 
 Tom 
 Don’t kid yourself.  It’s an attack.  An act of aggression, anyway.  They just showed everyone that they can change the world, and there’s not a damn thing we can do about it. 
 (scene change: in Shawn’s office; Shawn’s cell phone rings) 
 Shawn 
 Hello. 
 Daniel 
 I’m very disappointed in you, Shawn. 
 Shawn 
 Daniel. 
 Daniel 
 I realize you’re still a young man, but I’m afraid I can’t forgive you.  (he hangs up) 
 (scene changes: in various places) 
 TV 
 To repeat, I’m broadcasting live from the Nubian Desert, north of Khartoum, where, overnight— 
 (scene changes: Kevin’s apartment; he pulls out a tooth; Tom and Alana go into a fantasy world) 
 Tom 
 (in bed, holding a baby)  It’s okay, Kyle.  Daddy’s here.  I’m right here.  I’m right here.  Just go to sleep. 
 (scene change: Diana sees Maia off at her new school; Maia enters class where a boy demonstrates his ability with electricity) 
 Tyler 
 Hey.  I’m Tyler. 
 Maia 
 Maia. 
 (scene change: country; a car crosses a wooden bridge and drives to a cabin; Isabelle contemplates the syringe) 
 Richard 
 (in the car)  Lily?  We are here.  Hasn’t changed much, has it? 
 Lily 
 No.  We were so happy here.  Just you and me and the baby.  It was so much simpler. 
 Richard 
 Would you like to head on inside? 
 Lily 
 No.  Not just yet.  No.  Let’s—let’s just stay out here for a while.  It’s so peaceful.  (cut to Isabelle; she can’t kill herself but empties the syringe onto the floor) 
 Richard 
 Remember when you went into labor?  I could hardly get the car in gear.  (he laughs)  But you gave me directions to the hospital.  How did you stay so calm?  (he looks at Lily, but she has passed)  Lily?  (cut to Isabelle putting on her mother’s ring; Richard kisses his wife’s hand, remembering when they were married)
