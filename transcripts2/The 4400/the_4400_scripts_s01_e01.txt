 **March 3rd 1946 Crescent City, California** 
 A car is parked. Inside are seated a man and woman, and in the back is a young girl. The song 'I'm In Heaven' is playing on the radio. 
 Mrs Rutledge: Ethan, I don't think it's going to clear up anytime soon. 
 Ethan: I don't think it's gonna last that long. It's not raining that hard. 
 Mrs Rutledge: It was so nice this morning. 
 Ethan: Yeah. It'll clear up, and if it doesn't, we'll just have a picnic in the car. 
 Maia: No Daddy. I want to play. 
 Ethan: Oh no. You're gonna get all wet sweety. Maybe later. 
 Maia: Please! It's a very light shower. Please! I won't get wet. 
 Mrs Rutledge: Ok. 
 Maia: Yay! 
 Mrs Rutledge: But for just a minute. I want you to come right back. 
 Maia: I promise. 
 Ethan: Have fun. 
 Maia: I will. 
 Maia leaves the car and walks through a woodland area. A light appears from above, and the girl drops the flowers she's been picking, and disappears. 
 **May 11th 1951 South Korea** 
 A black soldier is being held by a group of white ones, while the repeatedly hit him. 
 Soldier: We treated you as an equal, but that wasn't good enough for you. You had to cross the line. I'd put in for a transfer if I were you. 
 He throws some pictures on the floor of Richard kissing a white girl. They others leave in disgust and suddenly a bright light appears from above. Richard looks up as the light get's brighter and engulfs him. 
 **June 11th 1979 Tacoma, Washington** 
 Two men are walking through a large ornate hallway. 
 Man: So where are you two going for dinner? 
 Orson: Chez Michael. 
 Man: That's gonna set you back. 
 Orson: Elizabeth has been married to me for 35 years. She deserves a nice meal. 
 Man: Have a good evening, Orson. 
 Orson: God bless. 
 Orson walks outside to his car. He places his briefcase on the bonnet and a bright light appears. 
 **April 22nd 2001 Highland Beach, Washington** 
 Two young men are sat on the beach at night, drinking. 
 Shawn: You need to slow down Cous! I'm not driving back into town, for another six pack. 
 Kyle: You're just afraid my Dad will kick your ass if I come home smelling like beer. 
 Shawn: Evil cousin Shawn, that's me. Corruptor of the innocent. 
 They clink their beer bottles together. 
 Kyle: That next door neighbour of yours, what's her name? She seem's ready for some corruption. 
 Shawn: You mean Nikki? She's 14, Kyle. 
 Kyle: 14? 
 Shawn: Yeah. 
 Kyle: Mmmm. 
 Shawn: Mmmm. 
 A bright light appears from above. Shawn disappears. Kyle screams and falls to the ground, unconscious. 
 Present Day 
 Kyle is in a hospital bed, in a coma. His father is sat at his bedside watching a tv. He stands up and moves over to the bed. 
 Tom: Hey kiddo! You're missing your show. It's a big comet. NASA say's we'll never see one closer in our lifetime. Yeah, I didn't think that would work. 
 Kyle's mother enters the room 
 Linda: Hi, how is he? 
 Tom: Same, same as always. 
 Linda: Some of your mail is still coming to the house. 
 Tom: I'll call the post office. 
 She moves over to the bed and brushes his hair back from his forehead. 
 Linda: Hi baby. 
 She kisses him 
 Tom: I haven't seen you around here for the last couple of day's. 
 Linda: I can't make it every day. Not anymore. Not after three years. 
 Tom: So what are we supposed to do? Just give up on him? 
 Linda: I better go. 
 Tom: Linda, just wait. Linda! Linda! 
 He rushes after her. 
 Linda: It's not a competition, Tom! It's not about who can sit by his side the longest. I still love him, I just can't live here like you do. 
 Tom: I know. I wasn't accusing you. 
 Linda: I saw you got a bill, from Olympia investigations. More private detectives? 
 Tom: I thought we were onto something. Someone matching Shawns description, living down in Monteray. 
 Linda: But it wasn't him, was it? Shawn could be anywhere. Even if you found him, it wouldn't wake Kyle up. 
 Tom: At least I'd have some answers. 
 Linda: I'm worried about you Tom. 
 Tom: Finding Shawn, and figuring out what happened to our son, is my job. How can you not know that? 
 Linda: You look tired. Try and get some rest. 
 She leaves the hospital 
 Shawn's younger brother is outside with his girlfriend. 
 Nikki: I thought we were supposed to be watching the comet. 
 Danny: Oh yeah, the comet. 
 She looks up into the sky. 
 Nikki: Is it supposed to be that bright? 
 Agent Diana Skouris of Homeland Security- Seattle Branch,is running on a treadmill. 
 Diana: Skouris here. 
 Ryland: Get over here, now! 
 Department Of Homeland Security, Seattle 
 Diana is rushing down a hallway. She rushes into a large room. 
 Diana: This cannot be good. 
 Ryland: Alright, listen up everyone. We're at Defcon 1. These envelopes are orders from home sect. Our first priority is to secure Seatac airport and ground all the planes. Gather up all the foreign dignitaries in the greater metropolitan area. Get them, the local elected officials and take them all to the shelters in those orders. 
 Diana: Someone bring me up to speed. Sid. 
 Sid: It's a Comet. It's not a fly by anymore. It's headed right at us. 
 Chen: Sir, it just changed course. It's headed right at us, again. 
 Diana: Comet's cannot change course. 
 Ryland: This one has. 
 Diana: Then it's not a comet. 
 Chen: It's estimated velocity is... 
 Sid: 3000km's a second. 
 Ryland: How much time do we have? 
 Chen: Impact in 28 minutes. 
 Another man comes up behind Ryland and hands him a phone. 
 Agent: Sir. 
 Ryland (Into phone): Ryland. Understood. 
 He puts the phone down and addresses the people in the room. 
 Ryland: China just launched it's missiles at it. Get ready guys, we're going next. 
 Kyle's hospital room 
 Tom is watching the news. 
 News: There has been a launch. The US military has launched a volley of 24 type 2 missiles. 
 People are out in the street, watching the missiles head for the comet. 
 Nikki: Kenny, what's going on? 
 Department of Homeland Security 
 Diana: Alright, our missiles are in the air. 
 Chen: England has launched too. 
 Sid: France and Russia. 
 Diana: Norad's saying the first lot of missiles will intercept in fifteen seconds. 9, 8,7,6,5,4.. 
 Kyle's room 
 News: 3,2,1 
 The missiles hit the target. 
 With Danny and the others 
 Susan (Danny's mom): We should get inside. 
 Homeland Security 
 Diana: Multiple hits. I think they got it. 
 Kyle's hospital room 
 News: Norad is reporting that at least nine of the Titan 2 missiles have hit their target. It appears the comet has... 
 Homeland Security 
 Chen: No effect. The comet's still headed right for us. 
 Ryland: How hard will it hit? 
 Diana: Something that big, that fast? You don't wanna know. You don't wanna know. 
 With Danny and Nikki 
 Nikki: I'm scared. I'm going to go find my parents, ok? 
 They kiss and she leaves. 
 Homeland Security 
 Diana phones her father.  
 Diana: Hey Dad. If you're there, can you pick up the phone? It's Diana. You know, your daughter. 
 Sid and the others are also phoning home. 
 Sid: Just tell my brother that I love him. 
 Chen: You tell mommy that I love her, ok? 
 Ryland: Nancy it's Dad. I just wanted to tell you, I love you.Danny's house 
 News: A catastrophic impact with Earth, now appears unavoidable. 
 Susan: Tom it's Susan. What is going on? Well Tom, isn't there a shelter that we can go to? I mean technically you still work for Homeland Security, don't you? 
 Kyle's hospital room 
 Tom: Susan, it doesn't matter. Those shelter's aren't going to make a damn bit of difference. I'm sorry. I love you sis. Just hug Danny close and pray for the best. 
 Homeland Security 
 Chen: Sir, British missiles just hit the object, but it's still coming. 
 Sid: It's entered the atmosphere. 
 Diana: I got it on Seatac radar. It's slowing down. 
 Ryland: What? 
 Diana: It's at mach 7. Mach 2. It's going subsonic. It's levelling off and continuing to lose speed. It's as if it's coming in for a landing. 
 Ryland: Landing? 
 Sid: What, like a plane? 
 Chen: No, more like a mothership. 
 Ryland: Give me some coordinates. Where is it going? 
 Diana: 47 North, Longtitude. 122, maybe 123, west, latitude. 
 Ryland: That's by Mount Rainier. That's our backyard. 
 Members of Homeland Security and the press arrive on the mountain. 
 Reporter: Come on, get the shot! Get the shot! 
 A ball of light comes out of the sky and begins to move along the lake. The onlookers stand silently and watch. 
 Reporter: We're close to the base of mount Rainier. The ball of light is massive. 100, 200ft in diameter. Hard to tell. We're going to try to get closer. I can tell you, that this is, without a doubt, one of the most incredible sights I've ever seen. 
 The public are watching the broadcast on their televisions. 
 The ball of light continues to hover and then begins to change shape. 
 Reporter: We're still looking for something official from the government. 
 The light get's smaller and suddenly explodes, sending out a large wave of energy, blowing people to the floor. 
 News: What's going on? 
 Reporter: We're not sure what's just happened. The ball of light is gone. 
 The mist begins to clear and as Diana looks on, thousands of people begin to emerge. Shawn is one of them, along with Orson, Richard and Maia. 
 Susan: I think I just... I saw your brother! 
 Danny: You sure? 
 Susan: Yeah! 
 Maia appears out of the mist. 
 Later at Homeland Security 
 Ryland: Pull me all the files from the Northern Counties. 
 He walks into another room where Tom is waiting. 
 Tom: I want back in. 
 Ryland: Tom, do you have any idea what I'm wading through here? I have over 4000 people, that stepped out of a ball of light and landed in my lap. Some of them have been gone 60 years. None of them have any memory of what happened to them. Now you want me to drop everything, because you want back in. 
 Tom: I can help. 
 Ryland: I needed help from you before. When Home Sec asked me who I wanted to bring over from the bureau, your name was at the top of the list. What did I get from you? 
 Tom: Five months. 
 Ryland: Five months, and then an indefinite leave of absence. You made fools out of both of us. 
 Tom: I needed to find the truth about what happened to my son! 
 Ryland: And you still do. And that's the reason you want back in, because your nephew is one of the returnee's. 
 Tom: Look I admit, I have a personal stake in this. That's why I'll come through for you. I need answers too. 
 Ryland takes Tom in to see Diana. 
 Ryland: Diana Skouris 
 Diana: Yes. 
 Ryland: Tom Baldwin. You two will be one of the teams that's responsible for investigating what happened to the returnee's. 
 Tom: Scouris! Ex CDC right? 
 Diana: Yes. I heard of you, too. 
 She turns to Ryland. 
 Diana: You gotta be kidding me, right? 
 Ryland: Is there a problem? 
 Diana: He went MIA once, who's to say he won't do it again? 
 Tom: Me. 
 Diana: Is this where you give me the 'Be a good soldier' speech? 
 Ryland: No, this is where I give you the speech, about how you're my best field scientist and Tom is my best lead investigator, and how together you're gonna make a good team. 
 Diana: Well, it should be interesting. 
 Tom: Nice to meet you, too. 
 Ryland: Beautiful. The sooner we find out what's going on, the better for us. 
 Tom walks over to a monitor, which is showing the returnee's milling around in a large room. 
 Ryland: The better for them. 
 The returnee's are logged. 
 Guard: What's your name again, sir? 
 A montage of faces and names appear. 
 Julia: Julius 
 Anita: Anita 
 Amanda: Amanda 
 Clips from various interviews with the people returned. 
 Amanda: I want to see my family. 
 Other people talk, in various languages. 
 Diana: So for them, no time has past. 
 Tom: So between you and me. What do you think happened to them? Where do you think they've been? 
 Diana: I don't know. There had to have been some kind of intelligence behind it. 
 Tom: Was it the hand of God? Or little grey men? 
 Diana: I'm not discounting anything. Here look, here's an interesting one. 
 Maia appears on the screen. 
 Maia: They're dead aren't they? 
 Diana: This is Maia Rutledge. She was the first one to disappear, as far as we can tell. She was eight years old, only she was born in 1938. 
 Maia: I'll be ok. Mostly. 
 Diana: She's a tough little kid. 
 Tom: Look, there's one returnee I'd like to interview myself. 
 Diana: Yeah, so I've been told. Returnee 1217, Shawn Farrell. He's all yours. 
 The Barbara Yates Show on TV 
 Interviewee: All we're asking for is access. These people deserve to see their families and to receive legal representation. They're private citizens who've done nothing wrong. 
 Yates: We don't know that. It's been less than a week. For all we know, these people could be walking time bombs. 
 Maia and Orsen are watching the show. 
 Maia: She doesn't like us much. 
 Orson: The feeling's mutual. 
 Shawn is pacing, while Richard sits reading the National Geographic. 
 Richard: The Secretary of State is coloured? 
 Shawn: Black. I'll take your word for it. 
 Richard: And the National Security Advisor, too. Lord, the world sure has changed, since we've been gone. You should try and relax son. You're not going to get out of here any quicker, by wearing a groove in the floor. 
 Shawn: You some kind of jailhouse philosopher? 
 Richard: Barracks philosopher actually. I was a combat pilot in Korea. 
 Shawn: Nice tattoo. Who's Lily? 
 Richard: A girl I used to know. 
 Tannoy: Shawn Farrell, report to interview room one. 
 Shawn: I'll see you. 
 He walks over to a side room. 
 Orson is sat at one of the hatches. 
 Interviewer: What's your name again, sir? 
 Orson: Orson Bailey. I wanna speak to someone in charge. I mean, why can't I just make a call. 
 Shawn arrives in the room to find Tom waiting for him. They are separated by glass. 
 Shawn: Uncle Tommy, hi! It's good to see you! Look, what's going on, nobody will tell us anything. 
 Tom appears to be in shock. 
 Tom: We'll let you know as soon as we find out. I still can't believe it's you. 
 Shawn: How do you think I feel? Listen, do you know how long they're gonna keep us, because I really want to go home. 
 Tom gestures for Shawn to sit. 
 Tom: Shawn, do you remember anything? Anything at all about what happened that night? 
 Shawn: See, nothing! Nothing. One minute I'm sitting there with Kyle, on the beach, the next, it's three years later, and I'm standing next to some mountain with a couple thousand strangers around me. Listen Uncle Tommy, some people are saying that we were abducted by aliens. 
 Tom: We can't rule anything out yet. 
 Shawn: Well can you give me anything? How's my Mom? How's Danny? 
 Tom: Fine, they're all fine. They miss you. 
 Shawn: Hey, what about Kyle? He must have seen something the night I disappeared. Did he tell you anything? 
 Tom stands up. 
 Tom: He hasn't said a word. 
 Shawn: He's ok, isn't he? Isn't he? 
 Tom: Kyle's in a coma, Shawn. 
 Shawn: What are you talking about? 
 Tom: What I'm talking about, is Kyle, lying in a bed, with a ventilator down his throat. Being fed down one tube and pissing out of another. He's been like that ever since the night you left. 
 Shawn: He was fine last time I saw him. We were having a couple of beers... 
 He sit's back down. 
 Tom: Look, don't you lie to me Shawn! 
 Shawn: I'm not. 
 Tom: Don't you lie to me! I've been waiting three years to hear the truth from you, so please don't lie to me. 
 Shawn is upset. 
 Shawn: I just told you the truth! Is that what you've been thinking, this whole time? That I gave Kyle something that messed him up and then I just took off? Screw you Uncle Tommy! I just told you everything I know! 
 He picks up a chair and throws it. 
 Shawn: Dammit!! 
 Richard is sat on a chair, playing with a zippo lighter A woman walks up to him. 
 Lily: You look as bored as I feel. I wish there were windows in this place. I'd like to see the stars, wouldn't you? 
 Richard stands up and seems to be confused. 
 Lily: Do I look that bad? 
 Richard: No, it's just that you remind me of someone I used to know. 
 Lily: How long you been gone? 
 Richard: Since '51. 
 Lily: Wouldn't be me then, '93. 
 Richard: My friend, her name was Lily, too. Lily Bonham. 
 Lily: That's my Grandmother's name. 
 Richard: Lily Bonham from St Louis? 
 Lily: You knew my Grandmother. 
 Richard: Is she still alive? 
 Lily: I'm sorry. She died before I was born. 
 Richard sit's in a chair, clearly upset. Lily kneels beside him. 
 Lily: Are you alright? 
 Richard: Lily's dead, and I'm sitting here with her Granddaughter. It doesn't make any sense. No goddamn sense at all. 
 Lily: I know how you feel. I keep thinking I'm going to wake up from this dream and tell my husband all about it. 
 Richard: You have a family? 
 Lily: Yeah. Brian and I and our daughter Heidi. She was six months when I...So what was she like, my Grandmother? Everyone say's I look a lot like her. 
 Richard: They were right. 
 Orson is still at one of the windows. 
 Interviewer: I'm sorry. That's not possible right now. 
 Orson: This is ridiculous. You have no right to hold us here like this. We haven't done anything wrong! 
 Interviewer: I'm sorry. 
 Maia approaches him and hands him a serviette. 
 Maia: This is for you 
 His nose is bleeding. 
 Later in Diana's office 
 Diana: We're letting them go? They've only been back six weeks. It's too soon. 
 Ryland: Well the ninth circuit court of appeal has upheld the lawsuit by the ACLU on behalf of the families. We don't have a legal right to hold them. 
 Chen: Ok, but some of these people have no place to go. No families left. 
 Sid: The word is, Egypt and China are refusing to repatriate it's citizens. India's on the fence. 
 Ryland: Well, wait a minute. We're not kicking anybody out. Whoever wants to stay, can stay. As far as American citizens, whoever leaves will get whatever assistance is required, to get their life back on track. Medicare, unemployment, rent vouchers, vocational training. 
 Diana: Vocational training? We need to isolate these people. 
 Tom: They're not virus samples, they're human beings. 
 Ryland: The orders been given. We're letting them go. I wouldn't book your vacations, just yet. 
 The doors are opened and the people are released. Maia sits on a chair, alone. 
 Ryland: Each regional Homeland Security Office, will be responsible for the returnee's who settle in their region. So we'll be monitoring 79 people. Plus, another 135 have chosen to remain in quarantine for the time being. 
 Maia is all alone now. 
 Ryland: Each of our returnee's, will check in once a week. Any difficulties faced by the returnee's in our district, will be handled by this office. Finally, we'll continue with our ongoing investigation. They'll all sleep better, once we know what the hell's going on. Thankyou. 
 The returnee's are queueing up and receiving numbers on cards. 
 Lily walks up to Richard. 
 Lily: You look so lonely standing there without an ID number. 
 Richard: I'm supposed to be 82 years old. There's no-one here waiting for me. 
 Lily: So what are you gonna do, now that you're out? 
 Richard: Head back to the old neighbourhood, I suppose. What about you? Wait, let me guess. Take your daughter to Woodland Park. 
 Lily: We used to love that place.Of course, Heidi was barely crawling then and now she's 12. 
 Richard: You've been a good friend. 
 Lily is crying, and they hug. 
 Kenny and Susan are waiting outside as Shawn walks up the stairs. 
 Orson speaks with one of the guards. 
 Orson: They told me there would be a bus to the city. 
 Guard: Yes sir, over there. 
 Lot's of families are waiting for their loved ones, each holding an ID number to enable the returnee's to recognise them. 
 Shawn: Hey Mom! Danny! 
 Shawn rushes over to his mother and brother. 
 Lily thinks she recognises her husband and walks over to a man. 
 Lily: Brian! Brian! 
 He turns, but it's not him. 
 Lily: I'm sorry. 
 Shawn has his arms around his family. 
 Shawn: Let's go! 
 A lot of reunions are happening, but Lily's husband isn't there. She decides to make her own way home, and arrives at her house. Nervously making her way to the door, she prepares to knock, just as two young girls open the door. 
 Heidi: Can I help you? 
 Lily: Heidi? 
 Heidi: Yeah. 
 Lily: Heidi, it's Mommy. 
 Heidi: Who? 
 A man comes rushing out. 
 Brian: Heidi! That's ok sweetie, I got it. 
 Lily: Brian. 
 Brian: Lily. 
 She begins to cry and rushes into his arms. 
 Brian: Look at you, you haven't aged a day. 
 Lily: Why didn't you come pick me up Didn't they contact you? 
 Brian: Yeah. You have to try to understand, Lil. I didn't think I was ever going to see you again. I'm married, Lily. Carole has been a really good mother to Heidi. We have a son now,too. A little boy. I'm sorry. Lily. 
 Lily turns and walks back down the steps, crying. 
 Orson is walking through what seems to be an old people's home. He approaches an elderly woman sat on a bed. 
 Orson: Elizabeth? 
 Elizabeth: Orson? Where have you been? I've been waiting for you. 
 He kisses her hand. 
 Orson: I know. 
 Elizabeth: Where's the car. We're going to be late for dinner. 
 Orson: I'm sorry honey. Things got a little out of control. But it won't happen again. 
 He begins to cry. 
 There's a welcome home party at Shawns house. He's walking through, welcoming people, whilst his arm remains around Danny's shoulder. 
 Shawn: Hey mom. Hey guys, it's good to see you. 
 Danny: I'm sorry your buddies didn't show up. I guess most of them are away at college. 
 Shawn: They're just jealous that I get to enjoy two more years of high school. 
 Nikki approaches them. 
 Nikki: High School's not that bad. Hi Shawn. Remember me? 
 Shawn: Nikki? No! Last time I saw you, you were just a little kid. Now look at you. 
 Danny has his arm around her. 
 Danny: Look at me, huh? 
 Shawn: Yeah, I guess so. 
 St. Louis, Missouri 
 Richard is walking amongst some homeless people, who are living in an abandoned building. 
 Chen: What the hell are you looking at? 
 Richard: I used to live here. 
 Chen: Yeah? Well, I live here now. Get the hell outta here! 
 Shawns house 
 Diana and Tom are in the kitchen. 
 Diana: Why did you bring me here? 
 Tom: I thought it would put a Human face on the returnee's, for you.Remind you they're people not virus'. 
 Linda walks in.  
 Linda: Tom, are you gonna introduce me to your new friend? 
 Tom: Ah, Linda. This is my partner. My work partner, Diana Scouriz. Diana this is my wife, Linda. 
 Linda: We're separated. Call me. We need to talk. 
 Diana: Well that was awkward. 
 Tom: Really? 
 Diana: Yeah. 
 Tom: I hadn't noticed. Give me a second. 
 He heads outside, to find Shawn sitting on the porch. 
 Tom: You look thirsty. 
 Shawn: Thankyou. 
 Tom: I just wanted you to know, I really am glad you're back. 
 Shawn: Whatever, Uncle Tom, I mean... 
 A bird flies into the side of the house, killing itself. Shawn picks it up and cradles it in his hands. 
 Shawn: Geez 
 Tom: Neck's broken. 
 Shawn: Reflection must have confused him, huh? 
 Tom: Why don't you come back inside. You're missing your own party. 
 Shawn: I know, it's just weird being in there. 
 The birds eyes open and it flies away. 
 Maia: I have to come to see the Doctor, every week? 
 Diana: I know, it doesn't sound like much fun to me either, but hey, you know, you get to live with these lovely people, and that beats a bunk in quarantine, right? 
 Foster Mother: Besides, there's nothing we can't handle, right Maia? 
 Maia: That would be nice. 
 Kenneth: Well we should get going. It's a bit of a drive to Everett. 
 Diana: Yeah, terrific. Good luck Maia. 
 Maia: You'll see me again. 
 Diana: Yeah, next week. 
 Maia: Sooner than that. 
 Diana looks confused and Maia walks away. 
 Orson is walking with his business partners son at the offices of Kensington and Bailey. 
 Adam: Can I get you anything? 
 Orson: Uh, water, that'll be fine. 
 Adam: Mary, could you get Mr Bailey some water? Just down here. You know, I can't get over it. You look exactly the same as the last time I saw you. 
 Orson: And you were what, thirteen. Your father asked me to show you the ropes. 
 Adam: Yes. 
 Orson: It looks like I succeeded. 
 Adam: Please have a seat. 
 Orson: Thank you. 
 Adam: So, what can I do for you Mr Bailey. 
 Orson: My old corner office, for starters. Thankyou. A secretary, some business cards. I should be able to start seeing clients within a week or so. 
 Adam: You're looking for a job? 
 Orson: This is still Kensington and Bailey, isn't it? 
 Adam: I'm embarrassed. Times are tight. I just had to lay off three of my actuaries. I don't have any openings right now, Mr Bailey. 
 Orson: Openings? I'm a partner here. 
 Adam: Mr Bailey, your interest in the company, was bought out, when you were declared dead. 
 Orson: I'm not dead. 
 Adam: Well, your wife accepted the settlement. It is all legal. 
 Orson: Don't be too sure of that. What happened to me, there's no precedent. 
 Adam: You are right about that, but it might be years until precedent is established. Until that happens, all of you returnee's are gonna have to get in line and plead your case in front of a judge. Do you have the kind of resources to... 
 Orson: Have you seen the kind of place my wife is in? I have to get her out of there! 
 Adam: I don't have permission to discuss this any further. 
 Orson: I need money, now! 
 He squeezes a glass until it shatters. 
 Maia arrives at her new home. 
 Foster Mother: This is the living room and there's the kitchen. Do you wanna see your room? 
 Maia: Ok. 
 Foster Mother: I think it's really nice. It's the one over here. 
 Kenneth: We just had it redone. 
 Maia: It's a very nice room. 
 Foster Mother: I got you a few things to start. Tomorrow we can go shopping and you can pick out a few bits, yourself. 
 Maia: Ok 
 She hops up onto the bed and takes her trainers off, putting them on the chair. 
 Kenneth: Maia honey, we have a rule. No shoes on the furniture. 
 Maia: I didn't want them to get wet. 
 Foster Mother: Wet? Why would they get wet? 
 Kenneth: Why don't you get cleaned up. We're going to eat soon. 
 They leave the room. Maia picks up the shoes and places them back on the chair. 
 Richard is walking through a diner, looking at the various people in the booths. 
 Maia is asleep in bed. 
 Shawn is outside in his garden. 
 Orson is sat at his wife's side. 
 Shawn sits on a bench and waves to Nikki, who's standing at her window. 
 Richard lights up a cigarette as he sit's in a booth at the diner. Some punk rockers point to a no smoking sign and he puts his cigarette out. 
 Lily is walking through the streets. 
 Shawns family car is covered in grafitti. 
 Water spills out of a hosepipe into Maia's bedroom. Her foster mother walks in and Maia stares at her. 
 Richard is looking at some old photo's of Lily. 
 Orson arrives in a taxi at the gate's of Adam's house. He begins to press the bell. 
 Orson: Adam, it's Orson. Let me in, I wanna talk. 
 He continues to press the buzzer, but Adam's ignoring it. 
 Orson: I know you can hear me. Let me in! You want me to wake the whole neighbourhood? 
 Orson begins to shake the gate and as he does so, the house begins to shake, smashing things inside. The windows blow out and Adam grabs his head as Orson begins to yell. Adam falls to the ground, dead, with some glass embedded in his chest. 
 Kyle's hospital room. 
 Diana turns up to find Tom asleep in the chair. 
 Diana: Tom? 
 Tom: What are you doing here? 
 Diana: Your phone is off. Ryland wants us to come in. 
 Tom: What's up? 
 Diana: There's been a murder. The police are holding one of the 4400. 
 Homeland Security 
 A picture of Orson is brought up on a monitor. 
 
 
 
 Ryland: That's him. That's Orson Bailey. 
 Tom: Bailey? Some kind of businessman, right? 
 Ryland: Right. 
 Tom: Life insurance? 
 Ryland: Yeah. 
 Diana: Disappeared in the 70's. 
 Ryland: '79. Declared dead in '86. Seattle police are holding him in connection with a homocide in Madison Park, last night. 
 Tom: Do they know he's one of the 4400? 
 Ryland: Bailey told them. That's why they called us. 
 Diana: Well, I thought the returnee's were told not to discuss their status? 
 Ryland: Well we counsel them to avoid it, if they possibly can, but we were talking job interviews and housing applications. There's not really a protocol for being questioned about a murder. 
 Tom: He said holding, not charging. 
 Ryland: That's right. There are some conflicting reports about what actually went on at the crime scene. 
 Tom: We'll check it out. 
 Ryland: Quietly. I don't want to be dodging microphones at the six 'o'clock news. 
 Tom: Quietly it is. 
 Ryland: Diana! 
 He hands her a folder, and they leave. 
 Tom leaves the building with Diana and uses his mobile to call his wife. He reaches her answerphone. 
 Answerphone: Hi, this is Linda. I can't come to the phone right now, but just leave a message and I'll call you back. 
 Tom: Linda it's me again. You said we needed to talk, so pick up the phone. Linda, come on. Alright, call me. 
 Diana: Everything alright? 
 Tom: Same old, same old. Call me, don't call me. I wish she'd make up her mind. 
 Diana: You know, I had a boyfriend once. Every time... 
 Tom: Boyfriend? 
 Diana: Well, don't look so surprised. God! Yeah, anyway, the thing about this guy thing... 
 Tom: You can stop! 
 Diana: I barely got started. 
 Tom: All I'm saying is, you don't have to try to make me feel better. 
 Diana: Well, it was more of an attempt at bonding, via a shared similar experience. Can you open the door? 
 Tom: How long did you go out with this guy? 
 Diana: Nine months. 
 Tom: Nine months. So you're equating your nine months of dating, with my nineteen years of marriage. 
 Diana: You're right, ok, forget it. You want me to drive? 
 Tom: What for? 
 Diana: I don't know. So you can brood? 
 Tom: Just get in. 
 He get's into the car and leaves her standing. She taps on the window as her door is still locked. 
 Shawn's first day back at High School. He walks up to find his locker. The halls are filled with people, all staring at him. Someone rushes up and pushes him against the locker. Kenny and Nikki are watching. 
 Brad: Look who floated in on a ball of light. Remember me? 
 Shawn: Rossi. Hi. It looks like the steroids finally kicked in. 
 Brad: Funny man, funny. I always did appreciate your sense of humour. But that time you sold me those concert tickets, right before you disappeared. 
 Shawn: To see the Foo Fighters? How was the show? 
 Brad: The police were waiting for me when I showed up. The tickets were stolen man. You got me arrested. 
 Shawn: You got arrested for stolen tickets? 
 Brad: Yeah, I had 5 tabs of ect's on me. I had to pee into a cup, once a week, for two years, because of you. 
 Shawn is being hit up against the locker. Nikki and Kenny rush over. 
 Nikki: Stop it! 
 Danny: Come on, get off of him! 
 Brad: It's between me and your brother. 
 Danny: Yeah? Well I'm making it between you and me. 
 Brad: See you around, freak. Oh by the way. I like the new paint job on your ride. 
 Brad walks away. 
 Nikki: You ok? 
 Shawn: Fine 
 Diana and Tom are looking at the surveillance video of Orson. 
 Officer: The security camera's caught everything. The guy definitely had a bug up his ass. Except, as far as we can tell, he never went inside. Kensington fell into all that glass, and impaled himself. 
 Tom: You've been through all the footage? 
 Officer: Every scrap. He never made it past the gate. 
 Tom: Hold on a second. Did you see that? 
 They watch as Orson shakes the gate so violently that it comes away from the concrete posts. 
 Tom: That's glass. 
 Diana: Yeah, something blew out the windows, but from the inside. 
 Officer: Yeah, we're still trying to figure that one out. There was no seismic activity. No evidence of a bomb or gas leak. 
 Tom: And Bailey's not talking? 
 Officer: We've sent half a dozen guys in there, but he hasn't given us anything. 
 Orson in interviewed. 
 Orson: Look, I've been over and over this, with you people. 
 Tom: We're not the police, we're Homeland Security. 
 Orson: Well tell the bozo's out there, that I had nothing to do with what happened to Adam. 
 Tom: Let's just go over your day again. You went to see Adam Kensington about a job, and even though your name is still on the company letterhead, he brushed you off. I know how that would make me feel. 
 Orson: I admit I was angry. I went to Adam's house to...I don't know why I went. But I didn't kill him. 
 Diana: Let me read you an e-mail Kensington sent to his attorney, after your visit. 
 Tom: It's not important. 
 Diana: Just a sec. Bailey is making desperate claims regarding his financial stake in the company. He actually threatened to sue. I don't think he realises, there are going to be hundreds of law suits involving the 4400. It'll take years. The poor b*st*rd, he really is rather.... 
 The coffee pots are shaking. 
 Diana: ...a pathetic case. 
 The coffee pots shatter. Orson's nose is bleeding. 
 Orson: Now I'm not a lawyer, but I'm not an idiot either. You've had me here for twelve hours. Either you charge me with something, or let me go. 
 Diana and Tom make their way out of the station. 
 Diana: So we're just gonna let him walk, after what happened in there? 
 Tom: Yeah, looks like it. But for future reference, if I ever wanna play good cop, bad cop, I'll let you know. 
 Diana: Which one do I get to be? 
 Tom: This isn't a joke. There's a time to lean in on a guy, and that wasn't it. You shut him down. 
 Diana: Look, I'm sorry. Bailey admitted he was angry with Kensington. He was at his house. 
 Tom: I didn't say it was over, did I? 
 Maia lays flowers on the graves of her parents. 
 Maia: Do you think they ever thought about me? 
 Foster Mother: Oh sweetie, they were your parents. I am sure that they thought about you every day. 
 Maia: Thanks for bringing me here. 
 Kenneth: This place used to be so nice. Now the kids leave their garbage everywhere. 
 Foster Mother: It's a shame. 
 Maia: You don't have to worry. Cranridge is nice. 
 Kenneth: Cranridge cemetary? 
 Maia: Yes, that's where you will be. 
 Kenneth: Be? Be what? 
 Maia: Buried. 
 Tom and Diana go to the morgue. 
 Medical Examiner : Kensington's a popular guy around here today. The whole staffs been through here for the post mortem. 
 Tom: Why's that? 
 Medical Examiner : Well, he may have been a boring old suit when he was alive? But in death, he's a rock star. 
 Diana: God, look at that. Those were his parietal bones? 
 They're looking at x-rays of his skull. 
 Medical Examiner : We've seen bleeding deaths in here, as bad as you can imagine. Even a guy who jumped off the space needle and had to be brought to us in a garbage bag, but I have never seen a skull in this kind of shape before. Thousands of tiny little bone fragments that... 
 Tom: Kensington was impaled. Are you saying that's not how he died? 
Medical Examiner :Oh, that would have killed him, but he was already dead, from a shattered skull. 
 Richard is in a phonebox. He phones Lily's house. 
 Heidi: Hello? 
 Richard: Hello, is Lily there? 
 Heidi: Who? 
 Richard: Is this Heidi? 
 Heidi: Yes. 
 Richard: I'm Richard Tyler, a friend of your mothers. 
 Heidi: My mother's name is Carole. Are you sure you have the right number? 
 Richard: This is the Moore residence, isn't it? 
 Heidi: Yeah, but there's no-one named Lily here, sorry. 
 Lily is with a Doctor. 
 Doctor: Well I can't give you any medicine for the nausea. 
 Lily: Why not? 
 Doctor: Because it wouldn't work. You're not sick Lily, you're pregnant. 
 Lily: That's impossible. The quarantine Doctors would have told me. 
 Doctor: You said they gave you a full screening seven weeks ago. If you'd just conceived, it wouldn't have shown up in their tests. 
 Lily: Conceived? When? 
 Doctor: I assume it happened right before you disappeared. But there's no mistake, you're definitely pregnant. There's nothing to worry about. I'd like to see you next week.... 
 Her voice fades out. Lily is in shock. 
 Seacrest Senior High School 
 Shawn is walking down the stairs. 
 Nikki: Shawn! 
 Shawn: Hey, how you doing? What's up? 
 Nikki: Good. Did you get your car fixed? 
 Shawn: It's gonna be in the shop for about a week. 
 Nikki: Yeah. You know, Danny and I are going to a party tonight at Irvin Chobey's house. You should come. 
 Shawn: I don't think so. 
 Nikki: Why not? 
 Shawn: Um, well, they're gonna be listening to music I've never listened to. Talking about movies I've never seen. School is bad enough. Partying with a bunch of runts from... 
 Nikki: Is that how you saw me? A runt? 
 Shawn: You were fourteen, Nikki. 
 Nikki: And now? 
 The bell rings. 
 Shawn: I'm late for class. 
 Orson goes to visit his wife. He finds her cubicle empty. 
 Orson: Where's my wife? 
 Manager: Mr Bailey, you have our deepest condolences. 
 Orson: What? 
 Manager: We called your hotel room, there was no answer. 
 Orson: Elizabeth? 
 Manager: It was a pulmonary embolism, about one 'o'clock this morning. We tried to revive her. 
 Orson: No!! She's all I have!! 
 He has the man hold by the collar. 
 Manager: Please just calm down. 
 Orson: She's all I have!! 
 He begins to lose control. Things begin to explode and his nose is bleeding again. 
 Homeland Security 
 Diana: So, the red dots mark the spots where the American members of the 4400 originally lived. 
 Tom: You mean, the returnee's. 
 Diana: Not according to the press. It's the 4400. Now you have to admit, it's a bit strange. A nice, round number, like that. I wonder if it has any significance. 
 Tom: So you're saying that if 3781 people, had suddenly shown up that night, it wouldn't have been as strange. 
 Diana: I'd say, slightly less strange. This however, is downright weird. Here's where the 4400 are right now, two weeks after their release. 
 Tom: 65% are still in Seattle. 
 Diana: They're just not going home, and none of them can come up with a good reason as to why. 
 Tom: You think it means something? 
 Diana: In the CDC, we'd call this a statistically significant, disease cluster. 
 Tom: Yeah well, in the FBI, we'd call it a freaky coincidence. 
 Diana: I don't believe in coincidences. Disease clusters. I believe in those. 
 Lily meet's with Brian in a restaurant. 
 Brian: What do you mean, you're pregnant? 
 Lily: I just found out a few day's ago. 
 Brian: I don't understand. When you disappeared, I'd been in New York for weeks, studying for the bar. 
 Lily: I can't explain it. I haven't been with anyone else. 
 Brian: So what are we talking, immaculate conception? 
 Lily: I don't know what we're talking about. I wish I did. 
 Brian: You know, when you disappeared, I'd have given anything in the world to talk to you again. I had whole conversations with you, in my head. I missed you so much, Lil. But we can't do this. I have another family now, and I'm sorry, I know that's not fair to you, but... 
 Lily: I am still part of your life, whether you want me to be or not. 
 Brian: Lil, you haven't been part of my life for eleven years. 
 Lily: I wanna see Heidi. 
 Brian: I'm sorry, that's impossible. 
 Lily: She's my daughter. 
 Brian: She doesn't know that. She thinks that Carole is her mother. 
 Lily: You never told her about me? 
 Brian: She was a baby when you left. Hell, we were babies when you left. 
 Lily: You can't stop me from seeing her. 
 Brian: I already have. 
 He hands her an envelope. 
 Lily: What's this? 
 Brian: It's a temporary restraining order. 
 Lily: But I haven't done anything wrong. 
 Brian: Lily, I'm a lawyer, I know how to work the system. Now I don't wanna use this, but I will if you force me to. My first priority has to be to protect my family. 
 Lily: I am your family! 
 Brian: I wish you were, but you're not. Not anymore. I'm sorry lil, I'm asking you. Please stay away from Heidi and from me. I'm sorry Lil. 
 He stands up and leaves. 
 The residential home 
 Manager: At first I thought it was an earthquake. Everything was shaking, falling off the walls, but then, I can't believe I'm gonna say this.... things started to fly around the room. Papers, chairs. 
 Tom: What do you mean, fly? 
 Manager: I mean fly. Like it was a tornado. Except there was no wind. Everybody was screaming. Mr Bailey Was shouting.My head felt like it was gonna burst, and then suddenly it was over. 
 Tom: What about Bailey? 
 Manager: Oh, he looked scared, like the rest of us. That's when he ran away. The staff, everyone's saying he's one of these people. The 4400? Is that true? 
 Tom: Listen to me very carefully. You are not going to talk about this to the press or anyone else, and the same goes for your staff. If I pick up a paper and see a word of this, or I see it reported on the news, I'm gonna take an interest in this place. 
 Tom, Diana and Ryland take a walk outside the Homeland Security building. 
 Ryland: Things flying around the room. 
 Tom: I know, but we got a half a dozen witnesses, all saying the same thing. 
 Ryland: Yeah, flying. I gotta do a briefing for Home Sect DC in the morning and I'm gonna tell them what? 
 Diana: Well I'd go with, the incident is under investigation. 
 Tom: Bailey checked out of his hotel, after he left the nursing home. He could be on the run, we're not sure. 
 Ryland: Find him. You bought us some time, but this story is gonna leak and I want Bailey in our hands before it does. 
 On campus 
 Nikki: Is this campus, everything you remember it to be? 
 Danny: You heard about Williams and Miss Sinclair, right? 
 Shawn: No. 
 Danny: No? They found them in the janitors closet. 
 Shawn: What is that? 
 Danny: Making out. Not bad. 
 Rossi watches them as they walk past. 
 Shawn: What? 
 Danny: Everybody in school's been talking about it. 
 Brad: Yo, freak! Still hiding behind your little brother? 
 Shawn: You know what Brad? You need to shut it down. 
 Brad: You wanna shut me down? You know, the only thing I'm shutting down, is you, bitch! 
 Shawn drops his bag, as Brad stands up. 
 Shawn: You're really starting to piss me off, now. 
 Brad: Come on, bring it! Knock me down. 
 They begin to fight on the grass. Shawn gets him on the floor and holds him there. Brad begins to turn blue and Kenny runs over shouting. 
 Danny: Hey, come on! Let him go! Shawn! 
 Shawn get's up. 
 Danny: What did you do to him? 
 Shawn is bleeding from the mouth, and walks away. 
 Maia's foster father has a brochure from a cemetary. 
 Kenneth: I don't wanna hear anymore. 
 Foster Mother: Keep your voice down, she'll hear you. 
 Kenneth: It's bad enough she tells us we're gonna be buried in Crown Ridge cemetary, but then the next day, we get a brochure from the place, in the mail? 
 Foster Mother: It's a coincidence. Look, she's not what we expected, so let's just talk to her. 
 Kenneth: Yeah. 
 The woman goes to Maia's room and finds her standing there with her bag packed. 
 Maia: It's ok. I knew I wasn't going to be here very long. 
 Shawn is playing basketball in the street with Kenny. 
 Danny: Come on, come on let's go. 
 Shawn: Give me the ball. 
 Danny: Your shot space boy. 
 Shawn: What is your problem 
 Danny: What's my problem? 
 Shawn: Yeah, what's your problem 
 Danny: Come on Danny, not you too. Come on! 
 Danny: The way he went down? That's not normal. You know it, I know it, everybody saw it! 
 Shawn: What are you saying? 
 Danny: You tell me. 
 Shawn: I didn't do anything to him, alright, Danny? Not a thing! 
 Tom and Diana are going through some of Elizabeth's belongings. 
 Diana: Is this all that's left, when you're done? Poor Mrs Bailey. A box of trinkets. 
 Tom: They're not trinkets. They're memories. The kind you leave behind, you know, for family and friends? 
 Diana: Hmmm. I should get to work on that. 
 Tom: I'm not going there. 
 Diana: Well, believe it or not, some of us are happier alone. 
 Tom: No-one's happy alone. If they think that, they're kidding themselves. 
 Diana: I thought you weren't going there? 
 Tom: Did you see this? This looks promising. 
 He finds a photo of Orson and Elizabeth. 
 Diana: Wyler summer cabin. Wyler was Elizabeth's maiden name. 
 Tom: Orson's panicking, he needs a place to run. 
 Diana: Well there's no address. 
 Tom: Then we'll have to find one. 
 Maia is taken back to Homeland Security. 
 Kenneth: It's better this way, for everyone. 
 Foster Mother: Everyone? Or just you
