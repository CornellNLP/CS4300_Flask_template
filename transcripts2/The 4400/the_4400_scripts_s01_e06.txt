 **Previously on 'The 4400'** 
 Flashbacks to previous episodes 
 Reporter: We're not sure what happened. Something's out there. The light has gone and thousands of people have appeared. 
 Ryland: Diana Skouris, Tom Baldwin. You'll be one of the teams investigating what happened to the returnees. We're letting them go. We have no right to hold them. 
 Lyttel: I'm Warren Lytell. HomeSec mentioned I was coming. I'm here to clean up your mess.There's gonna be a change around here. Be part of it or get swept aside. 
 Collier: I'll provide a safe haven for any 4400.You'll be our first residents 
 Lily: I'm in love with Richard. 
 Collier: Why would I break you up? 
 Lily: If you're on the job, I feel safe. So does the baby. 
 Richard: Two happy residents. That's a start. 
 Lyttel: Maia Rutledge, aged eight. Disappeared in '46. She makes predictions. Once they come true, next thing you know, she's removed from quarantine by one of our field agents. 
 Teacher: You can't bring Maia back to school any more. We have to consider the other students. 
 Maia: It'll be OK. 
 Diana: I's not OK. 
 Maia: Somebody will make everything better. 
 Lyttel: Next case, Shawn Farrell, aged 17. Disappeared in April of 2001 . It's a little thin. 
 Nikki: Me breaking up with Danny is not about you. 
 Shawn: OK. 
 Lyttel: I need to ask you a few questions about Kyle Baldwin. 
 Shawn: I don't know what happened. I put my hands on him, that's it. Woke up... 
 Kyle: Don't touch me.I recognise you but I don't know who you are. 
 Tom: What are you doing? 
 Kyle: I'm looking. 
 Tom: For what? 
 Kyle: For me. I finally understand. They're not the strangers. I am. I'm not Kyle Baldwin. 
 **Present** 
 Kyle is in a hospital room with his mother. He's using the remote to flick through TV channels. 
 Linda: Kyle. 
 Kyle: I'm not Kyle. 
 Linda: Then who are you? 
 Kyle: I don't know. I need more screens. 
 Linda: OK. 
 Tom is out in the hallway with Dr Mayhew. 
 Dr Mayhew: Your son is experiencing a dissociative disorder. That's not uncommon for newly awakened coma patients. He feels disconnected from his personality. 
 Tom: We knew he'd need to adjust but he doesn't know who he is. 
 Dr Mayhew: This is frustrating but you did the right thing bringing him back here. 
 Tom: Yeah. So what now? 
 Dr Mayhew: We need to do another cranial MRI. They'll be here in an hour to take him downstairs. I know this is difficult, Tom. But Kyle's come this far. We can't give up now. 
 Diana and Maia are buying some soda from a cart. 
 Diana: I think I've got the exact change. 
 Tony: Hello, cutie. 
 Diana: Thanks. 
 They walk away. 
 Maia: How long have you known that man? 
 Diana: Tony? About two years. He's nice. 
 Maia: He's very nice. 
 Diana: Why do you say that? 
 Maia: He's going to fall in love today. 
 Diana: Tony? My God. Good for him. It's not with me, is it? 
 Maia: Nope. 
 Diana: I didn't think so. Is there something else, Maia? 
 Maia: How long am l going to be like this? 
 Diana: Like what? 
 Maia: I don't want to know things before they happen. I want to be normal, like I used to be. 
 Diana: It's gonna be OK, sweetie. Besides, who's normal anyway? 
 Maia: You are. 
 Diana: Huh! You want to know a secret? Normal people like me... ...they just wish they were special, like you. 
 Back in Kyle's hospital room. 
 Kyle: Put the television back on. 
 Tom: Kyle, when you came home you spent all that time looking through your books. Then the maps, now the TV. What are you looking for? Maybe we can help you look, too. 
 Kyle looks past him at the TV screen. Tom turns to Linda. 
 Tom: Come here. You should go and get some rest. 
 Linda: I'm not leaving him. 
 Tom: All right. l'll go and grab some stuff. Be back in a half hour, OK? 
 Linda gets some soda and as she turns she see's a group of men walk into Kyle's room, including Lyttel She rushes forward and grabs Kyle as he is taken out. 
 Linda: What are you doing? Leave him alone! Who are you people? I'm calling Security. 
 Lyttel: I'm Agent Lytell. I work with your husband. 
 Linda: I don't care who you work with. 
 She grabs Kyle and he turns and whispers into her neck. 
 Kyle: Tell Tom I figured it out. I know where I have to be. 
 Lyttel: Don't worry. He's gonna be safe. The government's gonna be supervising his medical care from now on. 
 Homeland Security. Lyttel is in Ryland's office. 
 Ryland: You snatched that kid from a hospital? What were you thinking? 
 Lyttel: He's the only witness to an abduction. 
 Ryland: Kyle Baldwin can't remember his own name. 
 Lyttel: Then we'll help him remember. His mother's upset. lt's understandable. But DC sent me here to get some results... 
 Tom rushes in and pushes Lyttel up against the wall. 
 Ryland: Tom! 
 Tom: Where's my son? 
 Lyttel: Whoa! Get your hands off me Baldwin. 
 Tom get's out a gun. 
 Tom: I swear to God! I'll ask you one more time. 
 Lyttel: Ryland? You wanna give me somehelp? 
 Ryland: It's a tough call. 
 Tom: Where's Kyle? 
 Ryland: All right, Tom. You made your point. Put the gun away. 
 Lyttel: Dennis...Dennis. 
 Ryland: Tom, put the gun away. 
 He puts the gun away and takes a walk in the hallway with Ryland. 
 Tom: You should have let me pull the trigger. 
 Ryland: I was tempted. But shooting Lytell won't get Kyle back. 
 Tom: I t'd make me feel a hell of a lot better. Why Kyle? Why didn't he go after Shawn? 
 Ryland: Our doctors went over Shawn dozens of times. Kyle's new territory for them. 
 Tom: New territory? That's my son. 
 Ryland: I know that. 
 Tom: Can't you call DC? 
 Ryland: What good would that do? DC put Lytell here in the first place. They're backing his play. 
 Tom: So we do nothing? 
 Ryland: I didn't say that. We'll get Kyle back. 
 Tom: When? 
 Ryland: For Christ's sake, l don't know. I just heard an hour ago. I don't know where Lytell put him. 
 Tom: Not good enough, Dennis. I'm not gonna sit around around while you play phone tag with some beauracrat. I'm getting my son. 
 Tom begins to walk away and Ryland grabs him. 
 Tom: Get your hands off. 
 Ryland: Tom! We go back a long way. If you try to go around me on this, none of it matters. 
 Tom: I know. 
 He bumps into Diana, but keeps on walking. 
 Diana: Tom, what happened between you and Lytell? 
 Tom: Ask Ryland. 
 Diana: Tom! Tom! 
 Tom: What? 
 Diana: If you're in trouble, I need to know. 
 She follows him out to the car. 
 Tom: Why? 
 Diana: Cos I might be able to help. 
 Tom: Diana, just stay out of it, all right? 
 Diana: Drive the car. 
 Lily is at Doctor's Kern's office. 
 Dr Kern: Blood work looks fine, the RH factor levels are normal and your calcium's OK. So how do you feel, Lily? 
 Lily: It's hard sometimes. 
 Dr Kern: That's to be expected. Now, where was I? Oh, right. l'll have to draw some more amniotic fluid. 
 Lily: Why? ls something wrong? 
 Richard and Lily sit on a park bench in the 4400 complex. 
 Richard: What kind of genetic anomaly? 
 Lily: All I know is she wants to grow one of the baby's chromosomes in a lab. 
 Richard: It'll be OK. 
 Collier passes by in a golf cart. 
 Collier: It's gonna be a beautiful 18 holes. Either of you play golf? 
 Richard: I'm afraid not. 
 Collier: That's too bad. 
 Richard: Listen, about that doctor you sent us to. 
 Collier: Roxanne Kern. She's the best OBGYN in the Pacific northwest. You're in good hands. So how did that support group meeting go? 
 Lily: It went well, thank you. 
 Collier: Nobody complain about the catering? 
 Lily: I have to admit, the lobster sushi was a great idea. 
 Collier: You see? You just have to trust me. Your girlfriend has quite an imagination. She thought I was trying to steal her away from you. Can you believe that? 
 Richard: Er...not really. I like your confidence. See? You were worried about nothing. 
 Lily: I wasn't worried. 
 Shawn and Nikki are sat in his car watching Danny across the street. 
 Nikki: We've gotta tell him. 
 Shawn: I'll do it. lt should be me. 
 Nikki: When? 
 Shawn: Soon. I can't take all this sneaking around. Besides, I miss seeing you. 
 Nikki: I miss you, too. 
 Tom and Diana are arguing in the park. 
 Diana: You suspected that Shawn had these abilities since his coming home party and you never told me. Thanks for sharing. 
 Tom: I never told Linda either. 
 Diana: Yeah, but you're divorcing her. I'm your partner. 
 Tom: Yeah, I know. When we were first assigned to the 4400, you were calling them disease vectors and viruses. 
 Diana: I know what I was calling them. But have you noticed any change in me lately? Maybe because, I dunno, I have one of them living in my apartment? 
 Tom: Alright. Point taken. 
 Diana: Because if the situation were reversed, I would have told you. 
 Tom: I heard you, all right? Can we continue the reprimand later? 
 Diana: Fine. What are we going to do about Kyle? 
 Tom: 'We'? 
 Diana: Of course 'we'. 
 Tom: We are gonna go find him and bring him home. 
 Diana: Then we better get to work. 
 Collier's office. His secretary is on the phone. 
 Secretary: I'm sorry. Mr Collier is not available right now. I'll have him return your call..... Thank you, Dr Kern. 
 Richard enters. 
 Richard: Dr Kern, the OBGYN? 
 Secretary: Mm-hm. 
 Richard: Jordan about to have a baby? 
 Secretary: I wouldn't know. 
 Richard: Huh. Here's the security logs he asked to see. 
 Secretary: I'll put them on his desk. 
 Richard: Can l see Jordan's phone logs for the last couple of weeks? 
 Secretary: What for? 
 Richard: He's been receiving some threatening mail. I want to crosscheck it with his incoming calls. 
 Secretary: It doesn't leave this office. 
 Richard arrives at Dr Kerns office. 
 Richard: I need to see Dr Kern right now. 
 Nurse: Mr Tyler, she can't be disturbed. Mr Tyler! 
 Richard rushes into the office. 
 Richard: This won't take long. Dr Kern. 
 Nurse: I told him you were busy. 
 Kern: Does Lily have an appointment? 
 Richard: No. Why do you call Jordan Collier every time she comes to see you? 
 Kern: My phone habits don't concern you. 
 Richard: I think they do. What does Collier know about Lily's baby that she doesn't? 
 He returns home. 
 Lily: Sickle cell anaemia? How can my baby have the trait for sickle cell anaemia? Unless the father's black. 
 Richard: Maybe he is. 
 Lily: What are you saying, Richard? 
 Richard: I don't know. Maybe whoever took us used me as some kind of donor. The question is, why would Jordan have Dr Kern keep this from us? 
 Lily: The baby's carrying the sickle cell trait. That brings us closer. Maybe he doesn't want that to happen. 
 Richard: Maybe. I think it's time me and him had a talk. 
 Homeland Security 
 Lyttell is working on a laptop. 
 Lyttel: Michelle Hickock, returnee number 938. She's coming in at 4:00 for counselling and I want to see her afterwards, OK? 
 Tom walks past and phones Marco who is with Diana in the theory room. 
 Tom: He's logged on. 
 Marco: Lytell's on the network. You good to go? 
 Diana: Tom really appreciates you helping him. 
 Marco: I'm not doing it for Tom. 
 Lyttel notices Tom standing in a doorway staring at him. 
 Tom enters the theory room. 
 Diana: Come on. So, Kyle's being held at the quarantine Centre, building 9, sub-basement 3. 
 Tom: That's great. l owe you. 
 Diana: OK. Well... 
 Tom: Marco, thanks for your help. 
 Marco: No worries. 
 Tom: You ready to roll? 
 Diana: I think we should wait for the nightshift.At least they're half staffed. 
 Tom: OK. I'll pick you up at 4:00. 
 Diana: See you. 
 Tom's house. 
 Linda: Here, this is the place. lt's just outside of the city in West Belleview. 
 Tom: How do you know the seller isn't going to be there? 
 Linda: He's in Spain for three months. Another realtor told me. It'll be a perfect safe house. 
 Tom: Set it up. Make sure you're not followed on the way there. 
 Linda: You think I'm being watched? 
 Tom: If was Lytell, I'd keep an eye on you. Just remember to check your rearview mirror and stay cool. 
 Linda: I remember what you taught me. I just never thought I'd have to use it. 
 Tom: You'll do fine. I'll get Kyle and I'll meet you up there. 
 Linda: I'll be waiting. 
 They kiss. 
 Linda: You be careful. 
 Tom: I will. 
 Danny is at Nikki's house. He's bought her some earrings. 
 Danny: They're nice, huh? I remember how much you told me you liked moonstones. 
 Nikki: I do. But I can't accept these. 
 Danny: Why not? I mean, I got them for you. Come on, Nikki. Look, I know I messed up. 
 Nikki: Didn't Shawn talk to you? 
 Danny: Shawn: What does he have to do with anything? Nikki? 
 Diana arrvies to pick Maia up from daycare. 
 Teacher: Hey. 
 Diana: Maia ready? 
 Teacher: Maia's over by the playground, talking with one of your colleagues. 
 Maia: Some of the clothes look funny. And the cars. But I don't know. Video games are kind of fun. 
 Lyttel: Did you like the video games in the rec room at quarantine? 
 Maia: I hardly ever got a chance to play. 
 Diana: Lytell, what are you doing here? 
 Lyttel: Just talking with Maia. I thought it was time we met. 
 Diana: Stay away from her. 
 Lyttel: That's not really your call, is it? Maia, it was nice talking with you. We'll do it again soon. 
 He leaves. 
 Maia: I don't like him. And he doesn't really like me either. 
 Diana: Well, don't you worry about him. 
 Maia: Are you sure? 
 Diana: Oh! You listen to me, Maia. l am absolutely sure. I am not gonna let anything bad happen to you. Hear me? All right? 
 Maia: OK. 
 Collier is in the hot tub at his home. Richard arrives. 
 Richard: Jordan, do you have a minute? 
 Collier: I know why you're here. Roxanne Kern called me as soon as you left her office. I hope you and Lily aren't blowing this up into something bigger than it is, cos a doctor's trying to get on my good side. 
 Richard: We appreciate everything you've done, from the house to my job. Our lives have been a lot more comfortable since we met. 
 Collier: You're gonna hurt me now, aren't you? 
 Richard: It's time you back off. Let us run our own lives. 
 Collier: Whatever you want. Tell Lily I said hi, will you? 
 Richard: I'll do that. 
 Tom knocks on Diana's door. 
 Tom: You good to go? 
 Diana: Just give me a sec. 
 She walks over to speak with the babysitter. 
 Diana: Gloria, just remember what I told you. Don't answer the door to anyone you don't know, OK? Cool. 
 Maia: Are you leaving now? 
 Diana: Yeah. I'll be back before you wake up. 
 Maia: OK. 
 Diana: Better go. Bye. 
 Tom: Diana. 
 Maia: Don't worry. You'll find him. 
 Tom: Find who? 
 Maia: Your son, Kyle. He's the answer. 
 Tom: The answer to what? 
 Maia: Everything. 
 Diana walks up to a guard at the building where Kyle is being held. 
 Diana: I want to see Kyle Baldwin, please. 
 Guard: You're not on the list. 
 Diana: I'm a friend of the family. I want to know that he's all right. He's not even one of the 4400 and his father works with me and if you could just give me something I could tell him cos... Come on, we're both supposed to be on the same side, right? 
 Guard: I'll see what I can find out. 
 Diana: Great. Thank you so much. That's great. 
 As he turns she injects him in the back and he falls to the ground. 
 Diana: You won't even have a headache when you wake up. Well, maybe a little headache. 
 She uses the phone. 
 Diana: Come on in. 
 Tom and Diana rush into Kyle's room. 
 Tom: Kyle. Hey, buddy. lt's me, buddy. 
 Kyle: Highland Beach. 
 Tom: What about it? 
 Kyle: That's where I have to go. 
 Diana: Highland Beach. 
 Tom: Let's get you out of here first, ok? Come on. Up. 
 Tom phones Linda from the car. 
 Tom: We got him Linda. He's sitting right here next to me. He's about the same. No worse, anyway. See you in a little while. 
 Diana: How far away is this safe house? 
 Tom: It's about 30 miles. 
 Tom: Your mom's waiting for you, buddy. 
 Kyle: No. Highland Beach. 
 Kyle grabs the wheel. 
 Tom: Hey! Kyle! Let go! Kyle! 
 Kyle: Highland Beach! 
 Tom: Let go! Let go! 
 Diana: Calm down! 
 Kyle: We have to go there now. 
 Diana: What's at Highland Beach? 
 Tom: That's where Shawn disappeared. 
 Kyle: I have to go back there, now! 
 Tom: Just calm down, buddy. Just... If that's what you want, we'll take you. 
 Diana: Are you sure about that? 
 Tom: Kyle's the answer, right? 
 Lyttel walks up to Ryland at Homeland Security. 
 Lyttel: Two agents of your agents are operating outside of the ten. 
 Ryland: I noticed. You know why? Because you pulled the Baldwin kid out of the hospital. 
 Lyttel: DC wouldn't see it that way. 
 Ryland: DC thought it was a good move to send you here. 
 Lyttel: Are we gonna bring him in or not? 
 Ryland whispers to Sid. 
 Ryland: Find him. 
 Lily walks into Colliers outer office and hands some paperwork to Sally. 
 Lily: Sal, these people are coming to the next meeting. It's a little bigger than the last so we may need a couple more tables. 
 
 
 
 Sally: I'll take care of it. 
 Lily: Thank you. 
 Collier comes out of his office. 
 Collier: Lily. Can I see you for a minute? 
 Lily: I have a few errands to run. 
 Collier: This won't take long. 
 He show's her a newspaper from years before that has the headline 'Trial Date Set For Negro In Assault Case'. 
 Lily: Where did you get this? 
 Collier: I've been doing security checks on everyone who's moved into the complex. Don't look shocked, Lily. A lot of people would love to see me fall on my face here. A scandal like this would allow them to force me out of the company. 
 Lily: Richard wouldn't do this. 
 Collier: I'd have thought so, too. I guess we were both wrong. 
 Lily: Do you really think this is going to change the way I feel about him? 
 Collier: That's up to you. But Lily... you really have to ask yourself... Is this the man you want raising your baby? 
 Later at home, she shows the paper to Richard. 
 Lily: Aren't you gonna say something? 
 Richard: It was my 23rd birthday. A bunch of guys from the barracks invited me out to a bar. 
 Lily: You don't drink. 
 Richard: Didn't then either. But these guys....It was a big deal them asking me to come along. In those days, Negroes and whites didn't do much socialising. So I went. It was kind of nice, you know? Then this woman started coming onto me. People started staring. So I figured it was time for me to get out of there. She followed me outside and asked me to go home with her. I declined respectfully. That's when she started screaming. 
 Lily: That's it? That's all that happened? 
 Richard: That's all it took in 1945. 
 Lily: But the statement the woman made to the police. I mean... It's so detailed. 
 Richard: But Lily, none of it's true. If I hadn't been exonerated of those charges, do you think the air force have sent me to flight school? Made me a pilot? The woman lied. The charges got dropped. 
 Lily: Why would Jordan bring this up? 
 Richard: He wants you doubt me. Doubt us. Do you? 
 Lily: We've gotta pack whatever we can in five minutes. We're getting out of here. 
 Homeland Security is tracking Tom's car. 
 Sid: They're heading west on Sandburg. 
 Lyttel: There are no freeways in that direction. 
 Ryland: Highland Beach. That's where they're going. Have my car brought around. 
 Lyttel: I'm coming. 
 Ryland: I don't care what you do, just keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way. 
 Shawn is at home, sat at a table with his mother. 
 Shawn: Come on, Mom. Are you serious? The movies? Like, you and me? 
 Susan: Is that so weird? We used to go to the movies all the time. 
 Shawn: When I was six. 
 Danny rushes in. 
 Danny: Shawn! You prick! 
 Danny punches him. 
 Shawn: Danny! 
 Susan: Danny! 
 Shawn throws him into a chair. 
 Shawn: Listen to me... 
 Danny: You goddamn freak! 
 Susan: Danny, stop this! Boys, please! Danny, Shawn, stop! 
 Danny is punching Shawn who is on the floor. Suddenly, Shawn places his hand on Shawn's chest. 
 Shawn: Stop blaming me for Nikki! Don't you see it's over between you two? 
 The life is being drained out of him. Susan pulls Danny away. 
 Susan: That's enough! Shawn, stop it! You're killing him! 
 Susan: What did you do? 
 Shawn: I don't know. I didn't mean to do anything! 
 Shawn: Danny! 
 Susan: Get away from him! 
 Shawn leaves the house and Nikki approaches him 
 Nikki: Shawn? I heard you guys shouting. 
 Shawn: Don't touch me. 
 Nikki: What? 
 Shawn: Don't touch me. You're the only good thing that's happened to me since I've been back. But I can't stay here and you can't come where I'm going. 
 Nikki: Shawn... 
 Shawn: I love you, Nikki. 
 Nikki: I love you. What are you doing? Shawn! No! Stay here and talk about this. Shawn! Shawn, what are you doing? Shawn! 
 Lily and Richard are putting suitcases in the boot of their car, when Collier and another man pull up. 
 Collier: What's all this? 
 Richard: What's it look like? 
 Collier: Have you two thought about what you're doing.I mean really thought about it. Because let me remind you, it is dangerous outside those gates. 
 Richard: We'll risk it. 
 Collier: Lily, think about the baby. 
 Lily: What has the baby to do with this? 
 Collier: Everything. That baby could be the key to the future and I can protect it better than Richard or anyone. 
 Richard: Lily, get in the car. 
 Collier: I can't let you do that. 
 Richard pulls out a gun. 
 Richard: Stay away from her. 
 Lily: Argh! 
 Lily is in pain. Collier grabs her. As Richard fights off the others, Collier has his hand on Lily's stomach. The baby is not happy and appears to be causing him great pain. He falls to the ground and Richard and Lily get into the car 
 Collier: Go ahead! Run! It won't do you any good. I will find you. That baby belongs with me. 
 Highland Beach 
 Tom: Kyle! Kyle, we've been walking for ten minutes. What are you looking for? Maybe we can help you, Kyle. This is where we found him. 
 Diana: We're running out of time. 
 Tom: Kyle, I brought you here like you asked. But if there's something you need to do, you better do it fast. 
 Kyle: I belong here. 
 Shawn arrives at Collier's complex. 
 Shawn: I tried really hard and.... no matter what I've done, which way I've turned, it just... It sucks. I need to clear my head and get away for a while. I guess what l'm asking is if I could stay here for a while. 
 Collier: Shawn, you're one of the 4400. As far as I'm concerned,you can stay here as long as you want. 
 Shawn: That's great, man. Thanks. Thank you. 
 Collier: So, erm...tell me a little bit more about this ability of yours. 
 Lily and Richard are in the car. 
 Lily: Any idea where we're headed? 
 Richard: I'll know it when I see it. 
 Lily: He's gonna come after us. The baby likes that. You know...it really wouldn't be so bad, would it? If you were the father? 
 Richard: No, it wouldn't be bad at all. 
 Highland Beach. Ryland and Lyttel arrive with other agents. 
 Lyttel: That's their car. Let's go. 
 Ryland: Now, listen, these are not criminals. They're two of our own. Keep your gun holstered. There's no cause for anybody to get hurt. 
 Tom: Kyle, they're coming for you. They're gonna want to take you away. 
 Kyle: They're too late. 
 Kyle looks upwards and begins to gasp. A blue light starts to emanate from his chest. Tom rushes forward. 
 Tom: Kyle! 
 Diana: No! Tom, don't! 
 They are both enveloped in a white light. The next moment they are standing by the water in the daylight. 
 Tom: Kyle? 
 Kyle: Tom. 
 Tom: You're not my son, are you? 
 Alter Kyle: No. Kyle was meant to be a channel, a way to communicate. 
 Tom: Communicate with who? 
 Alter Kyle: With you. To guide you in your dealings with the returnees. But something went wrong. Shawn interrupted the process. 
 Tom: That's what put him in a coma. He was like that for three years, because of you. 
 While the conversation is taking place, we see the scene from Diana's point of view. Tom and the being inside Kyle's body are turning slowly within the white light. 
 Diana: Tom! Tom. Tom. 
 Ryland and the others arrive. 
 Back with Tom. 
 Tom: Who are you? What are you? 
 Alter Kyle: I'm human. Like you. 
 Tom: No. You're nothing like me. 
 Alter Kyle: I come from a different time. That is all. Your future. 
 Tom: Is that where you took them? My nephew and all the others? 
 Alter Kyle: We needed them. 
 Tom: For what? 
 Alter Kyle: To survive. 
 Ryland approaches Diana 
 Ryland: Skouris. Skouris 
 Back with Tom. 
 Alter Kyle: In my time, humanity is dying out. 
 Tom: You mean it's all going to end? Everything? 
 Diana explains events to Ryland. 
 Ryland: What the hell is going on? 
 Diana: Kyle brought us out here. It's like he knew it was going to happen. 
 Lyttel: Did you ever think that maybe he's not Kyle Baldwin. He kept claiming he wasn't. Maybe he's telling the truth. 
 Ryland: Tom? Tom, are you all right? 
 Lyttel: We can't just stand around, we've got to do something. He could take Baldwin with him. Or kill him. 
 Ryland: Hey! Nobody is gonna do anything until we know what's going on in there. 
 Back with Tom and the person from the future. 
 Alter Kyle: Only those we took could prevent the catastrophe from happening. That's why they've been altered and seeded back into the timeline. 
 Tom: Why here? Why now? 
 Alter Kyle: Because history tells us this is where the path to oblivion began. 
 Tom: And the people you took are gonna stop that from happening? How? 
 Alter Kyle: They've already begun their work. And you have begun yours. 
 Lyttel and the others are getting more desperate. 
 Diana: Tom, come on. 
 Lyttel: Do something or I will. 
 Diana doesn't want to wait anymore. 
 Diana: That's it. I need you out of there. 
 Tom doesn't know what to do. 
 Tom: I don't understand. What is their work? What are we supposed to do? 
 Alter Kyle: You have to help them. 
 Tom: Help them? How? 
 Diana touches the light and is thrown back. Lyttel shoots at i. 
 Lyttel: Go! 
 Tom is getting closer to the answer. 
 Tom: How? 
 The bullet from Lyttel's gun has entered Kyles chest. 
 Tom: You're bleeding. 
 The light vanishes and Kyle's body falls to the floor. Ryland grabs Lyttel's gun. 
 Diana: Oh, God. Get an ambulance. Now! 
 Tom: Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me! Stay with me! Look at me! Look at me! Stay! Stay! No! No! Kyle! Kyle! Look at me! Look at me! Stay with me, Kyle! Stay with me! Stay with me! Come on! Come on! No! 
 Kyle dies. 
 Diana: Tom... 
 Kyle suddenly takes in a breath. A bright light envelops him. He opens his eyes and it appears that the human from the future inhabiting his body is gone. 
 Kyle: Dad? 
 Tom: Kyle! 
 Kyle: What are you doing here? Where's Shawn? 
 Tom: Kyle? 
 Kyle: Dad? I can explain about the beer. 
 Tom: No! Forget the beer. You don't have to explain anything. 
 Diana: What's going on? 
 Ryland: Tom. Tom. What did you see? 
 Tom: I got you, Kyle. 
 Six months later, Lily and Richard are living in a cabin. Richard is tending the fire, while Lily sit's on a bed. She seem's to be in pain. 
 Lily: The baby. 
 Richard: It's time? I'll get the car. 
 As they drive down a road, the tree's that are lining it, bow down to them as though in deference. 
 The End
