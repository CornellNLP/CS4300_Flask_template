 Renaissance 
(2x08 : Carrier) 
 Written by CRAIG SWEENEY 
Directed by NICK GOMEZ 
 **Previously on the 4400** 
 Diana reads Maia's journal and reports to NTAC. 
 Nina: As far as this department knew, Maia wasn't having visions anymore. 
 Diana: She was keeping them secret from me. Writing everything down in a diary. 
 Diana receives some mail. 
 Diana: It's a subpoeana 
 Maia: What do they want? 
 Diana: Your diary 
 Collier warns Shawn away from liv. 
 Collier: Don't reveal your healing ability, because if you heal one of them, you'll have to heal them all. 
 Shawn heals Livs boyfriend. 
 Collier: One day, all of this will be yours. The paperwork's been drawn up. The lawyers know what to do. 
 The sniper prepares to shoot Collier. 
 Collier: Everything's in place. 
 Collier is shot. 
 Shawn: He had a vision to save the future and now he won't be here to see us achieve it. But we will achieve it. 
 Shawn stands by Collier's casket. 
 Tom enters the room at the museum. 
 Alana: None of this is real to me either. This is where they altered us. Gave me the ability to create the world we've been living in. 
 Alana and Tom renew their marriage vows. 
 Alana: Thomas 
 **Present Time** 
 Tom and Alana return home and speak with Kyle as they eat dinner. 
 Kyle: So let me see if I've got this straight. You two met, fell in love and spent eight years together in some kind of alternate reality. And now you're here with eight years of love and marriage under your belts in what to us was no time at all. 
 Tom: Yeah, that, that, that about sums it up, yeah. 
 Kyle laughs. 
 Kyle: I'll play along. If you two start calling each other honey bunny, I'm SO outta here. 
 Alana: I told you he'd try, Thomas. 
 Kyle: How'd you know that? 
 Alana: Well you might be meeting me for the first time, but I know all about you. Your smart, your favourite writer is Alan Moore and your favourite meal is meatloaf. 
 Kyle: Well I can't be exactly the same. You said there was no 4400, so that means no coma. No time lost. 
 Tom: No major problems, that's right. You were happy. Successful. 
 Kyle: Meaning what? 
 Tom: Nothing. We used to talk about medical school, remember? Over there, you went to Stanford. 
 Kyle: How'd I do? 
 Tom: You graduated with honours. You became a neurologist. 
 Kyle: Must have made you proud. 
 Tom: I'm always proud of you. 
 Kyle: Right. But Doctor Kyle Baldwin in that world you were vacationing in, came from your mind, right? 
 Alana: Uh, actually it was my mind. 
 Kyle: Right, but you created it using his memories. 
 Tom: Kyle! I'm just as proud of what you've accomplished here! Prouder. 
 Diana is in the office when Marco enters. 
 Marco: Hey. 
 Diana: You wanna know why all lawyers are jerks? Cos they spend a lifetime reading this crap. 
 He sits on her desk. 
 Marco: What kind of crap specifically? I'm a pretty good interpreter. 
 Diana: I have 24 hours to turn Maia's diary over to NTAC and not one legal option to get out of it. 
 Marco: What are you going to do? 
 Diana: Well, what NTAC wants, NTAC gets. But I have a nine year old daughter at home who's counting on me to protect her. 
 Marco: Is there any way I can help? 
 Diana: Yeah, you can slap me upside the head for mentioning the diary in the first place. It didn't save Collier's life and now it's making mine hell. 
 Marco: How about I just make some fresh coffee instead. 
 Diana: Thanks. 
 Marco: Yeah. 
 He leaves the office. 
 Back at the Baldwin house and Kyle is sat on the sofa reading the newspaper which has a story on Collier's murder. Alana enters the room. 
 Alana: Do you think they'll find the man who did it? 
 Kyle: By they, you mean, Thomas? Yeah, probably. Dad always gets his man. You heading out? 
 Alana: Yes, I have to keep reminding myself I don't live here anymore. 
 Kyle looks at her and then turns his head away. 
 Alana: Look Kyle. Your father and I love each other. 
 Kyle: That's great. There's not enough love in the world. But I just met you. Give me a few day's before I start calling you Mom, ok? 
 Alana: Uh, you've got one of those already. I'd settle for being a good friend. And I'll keep bribing you with meatloaf until you give in. 
 She leaves the room. 
 The scene shifts to a diner. All the customers and staff lie dead. Outside, people lie on the pavement and in cars. A woman, Jean Delynn Baker, an abductee who disappeared on Oct 27th 1999, stands among the dead and is visibly upset. She walks through the many bodies littering the street. 
 A limo arrives at the 4400 centre. A few men rush to greet the man who steps out of the car. 
 Man: Hello Mr Ross. Did you have a good flight? 
 Matthew: Yeah, thanks. 
 Man: Now would you like me to show you around, or do you wanna get some rest. 
 Matthew: Neither. Take me to Mr Farrell. 
 Man: Yes sir. Right this way. 
 Shawn and Lucy are in his office. 
 Lucy: They've been waiting three day's. 
 Shawn: Tell publicity I'm not sure yet. 
 Lucy: They're saying we're past our deadline. We have to release this press statement. 
 He reads the statement. 
 Shawn: This is supposed to be coming from me? I don't even understand half of what it say's. It doesn't sound like me, Lucy. 
 Lucy: So change it. You're the boss. Oh, and legal needs signatures now or no-one get's paid. Including legal. 
 Shawn: I can only do one thing at a time. 
 Lucy: So let's start with the statement. 
 Matthew enters the office. 
 Lucy: Why don't you dictate something to me? 
 Matthew: No press statement! If the press wants to know what Mr Farrell is thinking, they can watch 60 minutes along with the rest of America. I've already booked an exclusive interview with our new face at the 4400. That's all for now. 
 He hands Lucy back the file. 
 Matthew: Thanks. 
 Lucy looks at Shawn and leaves. 
 Matthew: I'm sorry to just jump in like that. I thought you could use a hand. Matthew Ross. 
 Shawn: Yes. Yeah. What are you doing in Seattle? 
 Matthew: I go where I'm needed. 
 Shawn: You've come to the right place. 
 Matthew: It's no coincidence, Shawn. Jordan made it clear that in the event of his death, I was to step up front and center to help you out. 
 Shawn: Well, another in a long line of plans that Jordan neglected to share with me. But I'm glad you're here. Jordan talked about you a lot. 
 Matthew: You're gonna have to hire yourself a new lobbyist. I'm moving to the home office for the time being. 
 Shawn: Pick any office you want. You start right away. Uh, these letters. Everyone knows I can heal, now. 
 Matthew: Jordan had every intention of revealing your healing ability to the public, but he was planning on doing it in stages. We don't have that luxury anymore. We'll deal with it. 
 Shawn: I can't go outside anymore. There's sick people, press, they follow me everywhere! 
 Matthew: And they will for the rest of your life. The ground just shifted under your feet. You either find your balance or you fall on your ass. This center's the new Lourdes. Nobody's gonna be calling us a cult, anymore. We're turning away people faster than we can sign them up. In ten years, this movements gonna be one of the most dominant faiths on the planet 
 Shawn: Stop. I'm glad things are going so well, I am, but a week ago I was just some guy trying to beat the last level of Doom. I wasn't the Pope then and I'm not the Pope now. 
 Matthew: Yes you are and you need to start getting used to it. 
 Back at NTAC. 
 Nina: The FBI is spearheading the hunt for the man who killed Jordan Collier. Oh, but we are still in the game and NTAC is making this collar. I'm not having someone else clear up are mess for us. 
 Agent: Then we'd better get moving. We all know there's an expiration day on these manhunts. Trail starts getting cold after 48 hours. 
 Tom: I wanna have a look at employee sign in sheets for every office building and parking garage within a ten block radius of the center. 
 Agent: We've already cross examined everyone on those books. 
 Diana: Well then we have to look OFF the books. This guy shot a public figure in broad daylight. There has to be an eyewitness. 
 Nina: And so far Tom, the only one who has seen this killer, is you. 
 April and Maia are at a newstand. April is scratching lottery cards. 
 April: Loser. Pathetic loser! Sweetie, whatever you do, never, ever gamble. It's wrong and it's stupid. 
 Maia: Then why do you do it? 
 April: Because unlike your Mommy, your Aunt April doesn't have a steady income. She's an artist and artists always need cash. Which is where the stupid part comes in, because I always lose. So, this whole see the future thing? It doesn't just apply to Earth shattering events, huh? 
 Maia: Not always. 
 April: So, if I were to ask you which card I.... 
 Maia: That one! 
 Maia points to a card. 
 April: I'll take this one right here. Thanks. 
 She scratches the card and is a winner. 
 April: Baby girl. You are my new lucky charm. 
 Tom and Diana go into Nina's office. 
 Nina: I'm pulling you off the Collier case. 
 Tom: What are you talking about? We still have half that neighbourhood to canvas. 
 Nina: Well, it's gonna have to wait. 
 She runs a tape. 
 Nina: 10.37am Pacific Standard. The Federal Emergency Management Agency sent in a task force to the town of Granite Pass Oregon, population 273, where there's been an outbreak of a lethal, highly contagious and as yet unidentified virus. 
 Diana: Airborne? 
 Nina: Yeah, likely. 
 Tom: Man made? 
 Nina: Unknown. All we do know is, if you went to sleep in Granite Pass last night, chances are, you're filling out a body bag this morning. There's only one resident that FEMA hasn't accounted for yet. Jean Delynn Baker, aged 30. Returnee 0188. Disappeared in '99. 
 Tom: Divorced, no kids. Psych profile say's she's a loner. 
 Diana: Looks like things have been pretty grim for her since she got back. Hasn't been able to hold down a job. Unemployed four times in the last year. 
 Nina: And now she's the only resident of Granite Pass Oregon, who can't be accounted for. So we've got two possibilities. 
 Diana: Either she's immune to this virus, in which case we could study her. Look for a cure. 
 Tom: Or else, she's the carrier. 
 Nina: Either way, your job is the same. Use whatever resources you need and find her. 
 Jean get's a lift in a truck. 
 Truck Driver: So, you gonna tell me where you're headed? 
 Jean is crying and doesn't answer. 
 Truck Driver: I never could stand the sight of a woman in tears. I guess that's why I never got married. You in some kind of trouble? Run off from your family? Law on your tail? 
 Jean: Seattle. I'm going to Seattle. 
 Truck Driver: It's a big city. You want me to just drop you on the edge of town? 
 Jean: I'm going to the 4400 center. I gotta get there. 
 Jean's hands are covered in blisters. 
 Truck Driver: What the hell for? You joining up? 
 Jean: Just get me as close as you can, please! 
 Truck Driver: If you're looking for salvation, you're not gonna find it there. What you wanna do is give yourself over to your true Lord and saviour. Purification day is coming. The signs are everywhere. Pestilence, plague's. 
 Jean: Tell me about it. I woke up in a town full of dead people this morning. My mother, my father, everyone. 
 Truck Driver: Yeah? How come you survived? 
 Jean: I think maybe I caused it. 
 Truck Driver: You? Now I know you're messing with me. Ok, go ahead. Laugh at the Jesus freak! But I'm telling you. The whole world will be wiped clean soon enough. 
 Jean: Look, I don't think you're a freak at all, Mr. Matter of fact, I believe everything you're saying. 
 Diana and Tom arrive in Granite Pass. They both are wearing hazmat suits. Diana takes a look at one of the bodies lying in the street. 
 Diana: The eyes and fingernails show only slight discolouration.Rigormortis has barely set in. What do the autopsy's show? 
 Agent: Nothing we have a name for. Their internal organs are pretty much liquified. This thing works fast. 
 Diana: So you just took your helmet off. You got a death wish? 
 Agent: This virus get's released, dissipates and then disappears within a half hour. Seen enough? 
 Diana: Plenty. 
 Diana and Tom take their helmets off. 
 Tom: So everyone died this morning, because they were within the virus' original radius. 
 Diana: Right. and if you'd drove through town an hour later, you would have been fine. 
 Tom: That's something, anyway. But Orson Bailey and Trent Applebaum. When a 4400 manifests an ability, they get more intense, quickly. 
 Diana: Which means, if Jean Delynn Baker, is transmitting the virus. 
 Tom: Yeah, she might be just warming up. 
 Shawn is reading some letters from people begging for his help. 
 Letter 1: Doctors say they can't stop my cancer from spreading... 
 Letter 2: I'veworked hard all my life. Tuberculosis is eating up my life savings. My beloved wife of 40 years... 
 Letter 3: Grandma told me to pray, so when I saw you on TV, I knew.... 
 Letter 4: Help me. 
 Shawn is upset and throws the letters onto the floor. Someone knocks on the door. 
 Lucy: Shawn, it's Lucy. You're scheduled for the new key's address. Everybody's waiting. Shawn? 
 Lily is pushing Isabelle through a hallway at the center. Matthew walks alongside her. 
 Lily: I'm flattered. I'm just not sure I can take a job, right about now. 
 Matthew: Richard's going to be travelling quite a bit. The daycare here is first rate and completely free. 
 Lily: Well for one thing, I'm not sure I'm qualified. I mean, Assistant Director of Human Resources. I had my first daughter right out of college. You could fit my entire resume on half a page. 
 Matthew: You're a 4400. It's like an advanced graduate degree, around here. Besides, Jordan talked about you. 
 Lily: Oh, I'm sure he did. 
 Matthew: He said you had the gift of empathy. That you were a natural born organiser and that you had a knack for bringing out the best in people. 
 Lily: Jordan said that about me? 
 Matthew: You're a returnee. You're smart. We empower people like you around here. 
 Tom and Diana go to Jean's house and find Marco there. 
 Marco: Wipe your feet. 
 Tom: A killer airborne virus has been released and you're worried about muddy footprints. 
 He waves his finger at him. 
 Marco: It's still somebody's home. 
 Diana: So this is where Jean Delynn Baker, lived. 
 Marco: Until she hit the road, yeah. 
 Tom: Did she keep a schedule or any kind of daily planner? 
 Scientist: Yeah, but I think it went out the window when she realised her entire home town had been wiped out. 
 Diana: Anyone get in touch with her parents? 
 Scientist: This was her house. They were sleeping upstairs when the virus hit. 
 Tom: Ok, you guy's aren't leaving this house, until you've gone through everything. Letter's, phone bills, grocery lists. Marco, listen to me. Find me a pattern. The way she thinks. She's on the run, I want to beat her to wherever she's headed. 
 Marco takes a picture of Diana as she leaves the room. 
 Scientist: Flirt! 
 Marco: You heard the man. 
 The 4400 center switchboard room. 
 Operator: 4400 center. How may I direct your call. 
 Jean: I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to kill them. I, these, these blisters. 
 Jean is calling from a motel room. 
 Jean: They itch so bad. 
 Operator: Killed who? 
 Jean: I need you to help me, please! 
 Operator: Who is this? 
 Jean: I'm a 4400 and there's something wrong with me. Everybody that I'm around dies and I don't know how to stop it. I don't know how to stop it. 
 The operator calls for a supervisor. 
 Operator: Tell me your name and where you are. 
 Matthew arrives when the call ends. 
 Matthew: How many people dead? 
 Operator: She said, hundreds. But there's nothing about it on the news. 
 Matthew: Could be they're trying to keep it quiet. And there is a 4400 named Jean Baker? 
 Operator: She said she's staying at a motel near the squirrel hill exit on the 64. 
 Matthew turns to Lucy. 
 Matthew: Get me NTAC on the phone. 
 Maia is sat in front of a mirror putting on make-up. April comes in carrying a laptop. 
 April: Yes! You were right! Philadelphia creamed them! 
 Maia: How much did you win? 
 April: $200 for Aunt April. All because of you. My little genius. Now, I'm looking at Chicago versus New York, even up. Chicago's the home team, which gives them some advantage, but New York is coming off a three game winning streak. So who's your pick? 
 Maia: How much are you betting? 
 April: The whole 200 bucks. Which won't win me enough to retire on, but a girls gotta start somewhere. So, you getting anything? 
 Maia: Do you like me? 
 April: What kind of question is that? 
 Maia: I mean, like me for myself. Or because I tell you stuff that's gonna happen. 
 April: Honey, listen. I love you for who you are, not what you can do. Always. Ok? 
 Maia nods and smiles 
 Maia: I'd go with Chicago. 
 April: Chicago it is. Now come on! Aunt April is gonna take you out for pizza. Go wash up and take your Mom's stuff off. You know she get's kind of uptight about.... 
 April takes Maia's hand and looks at some rings on her fingers. 
 April: Oh yeah. This is my Mother's engagement ring. Where did you get this? 
 Maia: I always play with it. 
 April: This is a very valuable ring. Which means it is not for little girl's to play with. Now wash good or I'll order anchovies. Go! 
 Maia leaves and April looks at the ring. 
 Alana is in the kitchen preparing dinner. Kyle runs in. 
 Kyle: Hey! 
 Alana: Hey! 
 Kyle: Don't take this the wrong way, but how did you get in here? 
 Alana: Ah, your Dad gave me a key. 
 Kyle: A little early for dinner, isn't it? 
 Alana: A little early for eating. Not for preparing. Can you cook? 
 Kyle: Sorry, I'm a world class brain surgeon, not a chef. But I can empty a grocery bag with the best of them though. But I have to warn you. You're ignoring the number one rule of Dad. 
 Alana: Which is? 
 Kyle: The longer and more carefully you prepare for a family event... 
 Alana: The more likely it is he won't show. 
 Kyle: Guess you do know the man. Which means, I guess, you also know me, which I'm sorry, is really weird. 
 Alana: You have to admit, it's a little strange for me too. We have this eight year relationship and I have to keep reminding myself that it doesn't really exist. 
 Kyle: So tell me. Was I like number one in my class at medical school? 
 Alana: Does it matter Kyle? You're not in competition with yourself. 
 Kyle: I'm just curious! 
 Alana: Well you keep bringing it up. It's more than curiosity. 
 Kyle: So what if it is? If you knew that there was some parallel universe, where a better, smarter version of yourself was walking around. How would you feel? 
 Alana: He wasn't better and he wasn't smarter. He was you. 
 Kyle: He just had options I'll never have. No 4400, no coma. He got to go to medical school. 
 Alana: Who say's you don't have that option? 
 Kyle: I'm 21. I'm a freshman in college. 
 Alana: So you started a little late. You keep thinking I know two Kyle's. I don't. I just know you. You wanna be a Doctor? I know for a fact that you can pass your MCAS 
 Tom and Diana make their way in the car to Jean's motel. 
 Diana: Jean Baker is in a motel about 10 miles ahead. 
 Tom: Right now, half of NTAC is headed for that place. Mortimer and Felconi should be there already. 
 Diana: It's weird huh? Responding to a tip that came from inside the 4400 center. 
 Tom: Well Shawn did tell me he wanted to cooperate with us. Guess he mean't it. 
 They arrive at the motel to find many cars already there. Tom show's his ID to a sheriff manning a roadblock. 
 Tom: Excuse me. We're NTAC. We need to get through here. 
 Sheriff: I'll open it for you. 
 Diana: So what's going on down there? 
 Sheriff: A dead trucker. Look's like it came on sudden. 
 They make their way over to the truck which has veered off the road. The trucker is lying over the steering wheel, dead. It's the same man that gave Jean a lift. They return to the car and head to the motel. 
 Jean is sat on the bed reading, when tear gas is thrown through the window. Men in hazmat suits burst in and grab her. 
 Man: Jean Delynn Baker! 
 Jean: No, no, no! What are you doing? I called you for help! 
 Man: We know! Come with us! 
 Jean: No, you're scaring me! Please stop, they start to itch when I get scared! Please! Get away from me! 
 The two men fall to the ground. 
 Jean: God! 
 She runs out of the room. Her hands are bleeding and the sores are weeping. As she runs outside, other men fall to the ground. She get's into a car and drives away. 
 Back in the car with Tom and Diana. 
 Diana: That trucker died not more than three hours ago. 
 Tom: He couldn't have picked up Jean more than two hours before that. 
 Diana: Which means he was exposed, infected and killed in like what, 20 minutes. That's faster than any virus I've ever seen. 
 Tom's phone rings. 
 Tom: Mortimer and Falcone. Look's like we're playing backup.[Into the phone] Baldwin! 
 Jean: It's not my fault. 
 Tom: Who is this? 
 Jean is in the car. 
 Jean: I called you for help! You tossed tear gas into my room! 
 Tom: Jean Baker. How did you get Mortimer's phone? 
 Jean: How do you think I got it? They scared me. They came barging into my room! 
 Tom: What did you do to them? 
 Jean: I guess you thought those suits they had on would keep them safe, huh? Well you were wrong, ok? Nobody's safe! That's why I'm warning you. You stay away from me, ok? Just keep everyone away! 
Tom: Where are you? 
 Jean: I'm driving. 
 Tom [To Diana]: I think she took their car. Call Jarvis. Get a beat on it. [To Jean] Jean, where are you? Where you're going. We wanna help you. 
 Jean: No, I tried that! No-one can help me. No-one ever could! Why should it be any different now!! 
 Tom: I know you don't wanna kill anyone, but listen to me. There's a virus that's growing inside you. It's incredibly lethal. 
 Jean: I've always been toxic. I've poisoned every relationship I've ever had! 
 Tom: This is different. 
 Jean: Yes! They made it real! My parents always thought I was a walking disaster. They never got to see how right they were. 
 Tom: Jean, it doesn't have to be like that. You want this to be over? It can be. Just find a deserted spot, pull over and wait for us to come to you. 
 Jean: I don't need you. I'm taking care of it myself. 
 Tom: What are you gonna do? 
 Jean: I'm gonna end this before I kill anyone else! 
 Tom: End what? 
 Jean: This phonecall, this day, everything! 
 Tom: Look Jean, just, just wait, hold on, just.... 
 Jean: Goodbye. 
 The call ends. 
 Tom: She say's she going to kill herself. 
 Diana: Well I'm not sure that's a solution. It could trigger another release of the virus. 
 Tom: Do we have a fix on her? 
 Diana: Yeah. She's travelling west on the 99. Jarvis has got three helicopters in the air. If she doesn't pull over, there's orders to incinerate. 
 Shawn talks with Matthew. 
 Matthew: Vacation? For how long? 
 Shawn: A month, maybe two, I don't know. 
 Matthew: You think that's what the center, the movement, needs right now? 
 Shawn: I don't know Matthew, but I'm damned sure it's what I need right now. 
 Matthew: I think you're going to have to settle for a long weekend. I hear Future Sound [SP] is nice. 
 Shawn: You're not hearing me. 
 Matthew: I'm ignoring you. There's a difference. 
 Shawn: Listen! I'm not saying I can't do this. I will lead this movement. But Jordan just died and I need some time to get my head around that. 
 Matthew: You're gonna have to grieve on the run, like the rest of us. It's called being a grown up. 
 Shawn: Don't lecture me about my responsibilities! You just got here. And if this place needs me the way that you keep saying that it does. Then it's gonna have to work around me sometimes. 
 Matthew: Look around you. We can do that. Mary O'Connell, taken 1972. Very promising empath. Robert Fields, 1987. Genius with numbers and pattern recognition. John Gerten... 
 Shawn: Who are these people? 
 Matthew: Replacements. Potentially. None of them make the slam dunk you would, but I'm ready to move this center forward, with you or otherwise. 
 Shawn: Jordan used to talk to me that way, sometimes. He was great at getting me to see things his way. You? You're not quite there yet. 
 Matthew: Your healing power makes you unique. Jordan knew it. I believed it. I came here to work with you, but you're asking me to work around you and that I can't do. 
 Shawn: Then you are going to have to spend some quality time with that list, because I'm leaving. I'm sure you won't miss a beat though. I know there's a huge demand for pattern recognition! 
 Shawn leaves the room. 
 
 
 
 Marco is still at Jean's house and is on the phone with Tom. 
 Marco: That's, that's, that's impossible. Mortimer and Falcone were wearing state of the art biohazard gear. That stuff's engineered to withstand an anthrax attack. 
 Tom: They're dead, Marco! Obviously, whatever she's releasing is a little crafter than the anthrax virus. 
 Marco: If it got through those suits, that means the antigen's operating on a sub atomic level. 
 Diana: Which basically makes it unstoppable. 
 Marco: Yeah, pretty much. 
 Tom: Jean told me Mortimer and Falcone scared her when they came into her room. Is it possible the release of this virus is connected to her emotional state? 
 Marco: Yeah, more than possible, it's likely. Her medicine cabinet is basically a neon sign flashing, borderline personality disorder. She's got cortisone creams for stress rashes. An assortment of your finer phsyco pharmaceutical's. Xanax, Prozac. 
 Tom: We get it, Marco. She's a wreck. 
 Marco: A wreck who's body acts as a delivery system for the virus she's producing. The same way flowers release pollen. 
 Diana: What, she's emitting spores? 
 Marco: Something like that. Look, spores are just reproductive bodies released by her vascular system. Now the human body is one big vascular system, you know, it runs on blood flow. 
 Diana: Yeah, which can speed up or slow down. depending on moods, feelings... 
 Marco: Right. So when Jean's blood get's going. When she's angry, confused, upset, whatever, a killer virus goes airborne. 
 Tom: We're not far from her car now, Marco. Any advice on how to deal with her? 
 Marco: Uh, don't piss her off? 
 Shawn is in his office attempting to write a letter. Many screwed up pieces of paper lay scattered around him. Lily enters the room, carrying Isabelle. 
 Shawn: Hey. 
 Lily: Hey. 
 Shawn: How are you Lily? 
 Lily: Good. I heard um, you're leaving for a while. 
 Shawn: Huh, that was fast. Anyway I uh, I don't know how long I'm gonna be gone. 
 Lily: What are you gonna do? 
 Shawn: Ah, for starters, I'm gonna disappear for a while. Then um, I don't know, who know's? I mean, I don't have to work here to make people healthy, so I guess I could go anywhere. 
 Lily: So you're just gonna kind of roam the Earth, Kung Fu style? 
 Shawn: Like I'd shave my head or wear a robe, but something like that I guess. 
 Lily: Well you could take these with you. Check out the return address. Stop of in Gloucester, Massachusetts . Do a quick healing and then go on your way. 
 She looks at the begging letters. 
 Shawn: You know about the letters? 
 Lily: Oh Shawn, they're everywhere. Each one sadder than the next. It's too much to take, almost. It did give me an idea though. But your leaving so we'll talk it over when you get back. 
 Shawn: No Lily! Like I said, I don't know when that's gonna be, so please. I would love to hear what you have to say. 
 Lily: Alright, well I was thinking. I mean, we're not a hospital and we're not a charity and still thousands of these requests keep pouring in every day. I mean, no wonder you feel overwhelmed. We're not set up to handle this. 
 Shawn: Yes exactly! That's why I gotta get outta here. 
 Lily: What if we set up a foundation. Part of this place, but seperate. Hire a staff who's only job is to open these letters and find the neediest cases. People that we can help that no-one else can. 
 Shawn: But that is still saying no to thousands of people. 
 Lily: That's right Shawn. But what if we can say yes to one? You heal one person a day, every day. 
 Shawn: That's a big job though. Deciding who deserves it most. 
 Lily: Well, so you form a committee and you load it up with Doctors, social workers... 
 Shawn: And you? 
 Lily: Oh, well... 
 Shawn: Come on, it's your idea. You should at least be there to help make it happen. 
 Lily: Yeah, I just took a job at human resources. I think I could probably get you transferred. 
 She smiles 
 Tom and Diana arrive to find Jean's car on fire. Tom makes his way over to one of the firefighters. 
 Tom: Did you find a body in there? 
 Firefighter: Can't get close enough yet. 
 Tom: As soon as you can, we need to retrieve it. 
 Diana: She said she wanted to end it. 
 Tom: I guess we could send Marco and his boy's back down to the basement. We might find a ripple effect on this one. 
 His phone rings. 
 Tom: Excuse me. Baldwin! 
 Jean: I came close, but, I don't know. 
 Tom: Jean. 
 Jean: I couldn't go through with it. 
 Tom: That's good. Nobody wants you dead. Just tell me where you are. 
 Jean: No, you can't help me. The 4400 Center can't help me, but it doesn't matter. I finally know where I'm supposed to go. 
 Tom: Tell me where. I'll meet you there. 
 Jean: You ever read the bible, Baldwin? 
 Tom: I went to Sunday School. 
 Jean: Spent some time with it back at the motel. The time is at hand. 
 Tom: That's Revelations, right? 
 Jean: But do you know what it means? I bet you don't. See, these blisters, they form on my hands. You get it. 
 Tom: Not sure I do, Jean. 
 Jean: They're talking about me in that book. You got family? 
 Tom: Jean, what are you talking about? 
 Jean: Go to 'em. Hug 'em real tight. I finally figured it out. Why they sent me back. I'm part of their plan. They want me to do this. 
 Tom: Do what? 
 Jean: Purify Humanity. 
 She puts the phone down and leaves the booth. 
 Diana: She was quoting Revelations? Never a good sign, Tom. 
 Tom: She's gone from wanting to help, wanting to stop all this, to believing she's the end of the world. So what does she mean? 
 Diana: She said they wanted her to do this, right? Well that implies it's out of her hands. 
 Tom: Destiny. 
 Diana: Well she's giving up responsibility. 
 Tom: Yeah, that's one way to deal with being a walking plague. Pretend the decision's out of your hands. 
 Diana: I don't think she even wants to think about it anymore. I think she just wants it over. 
 Tom: Well that's her mindset. It still doesn't tell us where she's going. 
 Diana: She's on auto pilot, Tom. My best guess? She does whatever she planned on doing before the bodies started rolling. 
 Marco is looking through a notebook, and phones Tom. 
 Tom: Marco. 
 Marco: Today's Tuesday, right? 
 Tom: It's Wednesday, Marco. 
 Marco: My bad. Uh, she's only got one thing written down for the day. She's filing her unemployment claim...in downtown Portland. 
 Maia is reading in her room and hears April shouting out. 
 April: Son of a bitch! I don't believe it! 
 April bursts through the door. 
 April: Am I dreaming, or did you not tell me that Chicago would win? Do you know what I bet? 
 Maia: $200? 
 Maia is lying on her front, still reading a book. 
 April: Try my Mother's diamond engagement ring and now it's gone! All because I believed in you! Trusted you! And you let me down! 
 Maia: You lied to me! You said winning didn't matter. You said you liked me anyway. 
 She begins to cry. 
 April: Ah, so you knew Chicago could lose, didn't you. Right from the jump, this was all just a test! 
 April sits on the bed. 
 Shawn and Matthew walk through the center. 
 Matthew: A foundation? Don't you think we have our hands full already? 
 Shawn: It's one person a day. Once it's up and running, it's not really gonna eat into my time. 
 Matthew: I thought you were looking for privacy. If you do this, you're stepping into a whitehouse spotlight. 
 Shawn: Yes, but it's on my terms. 
 Matthew: It would be good publicity. Not too hard to get off the ground. You could get some huge names for that filtering committee. I think it's a good idea. 
 Shawn: Well I'm glad that you approve, but I wasn't really asking for your permission. 
 Shawn walks away. 
 Matthew: I would hope not. 
 Jean stands on the pavement outside the Portland Employment Division. Diana and Tom approach her. 
 Tom: Jean. 
 Jean turns and looks at them. 
 Jean: Baldwin. 
 Tom: That's right. 
 Jean: You should have stayed away. 
 Diana: Look around you. All these people, they haven't done anything to hurt you. 
 Jean: They haven't done anything to help me, either. Besides, it doesn't matter. I don't have a choice. I am doing what they wanted me to do. 
 Tom: You don't have to accept that. You have a choice. 
 Jean: Yeah, like I had a choice when I was abducted. I never had a choice. Ever! They got the right girl for the job. What are you doing here, anyway? You should have gone back to your family, like I said. 
 Tom: No I'm, I'm right where I wanna be. 
 Jean: You must have some kind of death wish. 
 Tom: You think your here to kill people? I think I'm here to stop you. They infected you Jean, and that was wrong. But you don't have to let them make you into a mass murderer. 
 Jean: I'm already a killer! 
 Tom: No, you haven't decided to kill anyone. That's what you're doing right now! Whatever you're thinking about, destiny or fate, whatever, you're wrong. You don't have to do this. You don't. 
 He holds his hand out to her. 
 Jean: Wanna hear something funny? I believe you. But it's too late. 
 Blisters have appeared on her hands. 
 Jean: Oh, they're so white! I can't stop it now. I itch so bad! I don't.... 
 Diana shoots her through the heart and as she begins to fall, Tom catches her, gently lowering her to the ground. Medics run over and spray her hands. 
 Later, Diana is back in the office. Marco walks in. 
 Marco: Hell of a day. How you holding up? 
 Diana: Well, I'm scheduled for physichiatric counselling on Monday. Saved thousands of innocent people. Had to shoot a woman, to do it. 
 Marco: Hey, you did what you had to do. Anyway, uh, I'm not sure if this is a good time, but I made you a little something. 
 He hands her a black book with the word's Maia's Diary written on the front. 
 Marco: It's kind of a, well a fake version of Maia's diary. It should fool just about anybody. 
 Diana: You forged this to get NTAC off my back? 
 Marco: I know it's a big thing, but you were kind of over a barrel, so... 
 Diana: This could get me into a lot of trouble. This could get YOU in a lot of trouble. 
 Marco: Yeah uh, you don't have to use it if you don't want to. I'm just giving you an option. 
 Diana: This is insane. It's also, maybe one of the nicest things anybody's ever done for me. 
 Matthew and Lily are in the grounds of the 4400 Center. 
 Matthew: I wanna thank you for a job well done. You must have been very persuasive. 
 Lily: I just said what I thought. Your idea for a foundation was terrific. 
 Matthew: You mean your idea, don't you? 
 Lily: Do we have to be all cloak and dagger about it? Now you and Shawn both got what you wanted and a lot of sick people are gonna get help. 
 Matthew: Well you did a lot of good for the center today and I'm not gonna forget it. 
 Lily: Hey Matthew! You know what the center means to me? 
 Matthew: What? 
 Lily: Free rent and daycare for my daughter. I'm not 63. I'm not an 18 year old kid. I don't need you to discover the magic power inside of me. 
 Matthew: So in other words, you're not a true believer. 
 Lily: Is that a problem? 
 Matthew: Not at all. Neither am I. 
 He walks away. 
 Tom arrives home that night and heads to the kitchen. Alana enters. 
 Alana: You look wiped. 
 Tom: Don't ask. You didn't have to do this. 
 Alana: I didn't. Your son's the cook. 
 Tom: Kyle! I bet he had a little help. 
 Alana: Well you know, we got to talking. It was nice. 
 Tom: How was your day Alana? 
 Alana: Well I bought these pieces from this young artist girl from Benstein, self taught. And she painted this little scrap of garden in her backyard. And it's light and.... 
 Tom kisses her and she carries on telling him about her day. 
 Diana enters Nina's office. 
 Nina: You ok? 
 Diana: More or less. But you almost forgot. 
 She places the fake diary on Nina's desk. 
 Nina: No I didn't. But I thought in line of today's events that I would give you a little extension. 
 Diana: Well that's not necessary. It's a hot read. Lot's of good stuff about Spongebob. 
 Nina: Thankyou. 
 Diana leaves the office and Nina begins to read the diary. 
 Kyle is on his laptop looking at pre med courses. He turns to the television, which is showing Collier's murder. He has a flashback to smashing in the shop window and then suddenly the memories of the murder race through his head. Flashes of him burying a bag and shooting Collier. He turns from the television and bends over as though in pain. 
 A witness is at NTAC helping an artist sketch the killer. 
 Witness: His eyes were more narrow. Yes that's him. His mouth was more flat, not smiling. That's him! 
 The sketch is given to all NTAC members and posted on boards. It is quite a good likeness of Kyle, although not exact. 
 The End
