 Modus Operandi 
(1x04 : Becoming) 
 Written by CRAIG SWEENY 
Directed by DAVID STRAITON 
 **Previously on 'The 4400'** 
 Flashbacks to the ball of light approaching Earth, and the 4400 appearing on Mount Rainer. Danny and Shawn discussing Nikki. Diana agreeing to take Maia home to live with her. Tom accusing Shawn of having something to do with Kyle's condition and Kyle having to undergo surgery. 
 **Present** 
 A Sherriff Conrad receives a printed letter. 
 "The time I lost is gone. I'll never get it back, but my years in the dark didn't kill me. And my work remains. And even though l might not understand what's happening to me, I have faith in the final outcome. After all, l'm doing what l was intended to do, becoming what I was meant to be. I look forward to corresponding with you again, I know it's been a long time.I tell you this as a courtesy - you can observe my work, but there's no point in trying to interfere with it. I'm now in full command of my talents. I hope the world is read." 
 A picture of a young woman has been enclosed. The womans eyes are crossed out. 
 There are riots in the street as people panic over the 4400. The Barbara Yates Tv Show is on. Diana watches while Maia get's breakfast. 
 Yates: Despite protests, Homeland Security refuses to divulge the names or whereabouts of the 4400 living here in the US.Confirmed reports of unusual abilities have the public panicked. And yet this man sitting beside me says we have nothing to worry about. I'm sure most of you recognise him even though he's been away for the past 28 months. I'm talking about Mr Jordan Collier, who recently breached the government's wall of silence and chose to out himself as one of the notorious 4400. Jordan... Why? Why now? Why here? What's your agenda? 
 Collier: I have no agenda. But someone had to put a human face on the 4400. We've been demonised enoughby people like you. 
 Yates: Well, if you're implying this is a witch-hunt, I disagree. 
 Collier: You're not the one burnt at the stake. 
 Maia enters the room. 
 Maia: Breakfast is ready. 
 Diana: Shouldn't I be saying that to you? Maia! Thank you very much! This beats a can of coke and a slice of cold pizza. I'll get better at being the grown-up. 
 Maia: It's OK. I like being the grown-up. 
 Diana: I think you'll have a good time with Mrs Benke. I hear she's a very cool babysitter. I talked to Mr Ryland about permission to get you enrolled in school. Cos, that would be nice, right? 
 Maia: Yeah, school might be fun. 
 Diana begins to open a sealed newspaper. The headlines read 'Friday Harbor Killer Back After 21 Years. Latest murder fits pattern of unsolved crimes' 
 Maia: Diana...You're not going to like what's in there. 
 Homeland Security 
 Tom: Oliver Knox disappeared August 22nd 1983, five nights after the last body turned up. 
 Ryland: And he moved back to Friday Harbor, when? 
 Tom: About three weeks ago. Nineteen days before the latest body turned up. 
 Diana: It could be a coincidence. The letter seems genuine but the latest victim wasn't a prostitute. The other original ones, were. 
 Ryland: Coincidence. That's the kind of positive thinking we like to encourage in this department. Because, if it is Knox, then it means that we've got a 4400 serial killer on our hands. And if that's not a worst-case scenario, it'll sure as hell do for one. It's the kind of hot button issue Barbara Yates lives for. 
 Diana: So I guess we're taking a trip up to Friday Harbor. 
 Ryland: Bring me back a t-shirt. Alex... 
 Friday Harbor Police Department. 
 Tom and Diana meet with Sherriff Jim Conrad. 
 Conrad: National Threat Assessment Command, NTAC. Are you here about Knox? 
 Tom: Got it in one. 
 Conrad: It's a small town. Oliver reappeared after 21 years and he doesn't look a day older. We connected the dots. Are you gonna take over my investigation? 
 Tom: We'll be cooperating until we establish Knox's guilt or innocence. 
 Conrad: I could use some fresh air. And some cooperation. His alibi's airtight. 
 Tom: Alibi or not, we still want to talk to him. Anything else you can tell us? 
 They take a walk along the harbor front. 
 Conrad: You want to know about Knox? When he was 15, he was bow hunting with his cousin. There was an accident, Knox ended up with an arrow in his chest. His cousin panicked and ran. Knox woke up in a pool of blood, with an arrow in his chest. So he pulled it out and cauterised the wound? Even better. He stood up and walked four miles into town, strolled into the emergency room and checked himself in. All this with an arrow in his chest. Years later, I asked him if it happened that way. He said every word was true.I told him, 'That must have been the walk from hell.' 'Not at all', he said. 'It was exhilarating.' He felt like he could have walked forever. That's Oliver Knox. 
 Titles 
 Oliver Knox is watering the plants in his garden when Diana, Tom and the Sherriff arrive. 
 Tom: Mr Knox... Mr Knox. We've a few questions about the death of Theresa Baron. 
 Knox: Sheriff Conrad call you or you jumped to the same conclusion? 
 Tom: Not exactly a big jump. You were on the police radar back in '83. 
 Knox: Along with a number of other people. 
 Tom: Did you know Ms Baron? 
 Knox: No. She was born after I was abducted. Look, I know how tempting the math is on this murder. I disappear in '83, the killings stop. Here I am, and the poor girl's dead. 
 Tom: We noticed. 
 Knox: In your shoes, I'd probably want me to be guilty too. It would be so convenient, but... I almost feel bad l can't oblige you. I did not kill that woman. Listen, can I get you some water? If we're going to talk we might as well be civilised. 
 Tom: No. We've taken up enough of your time. 
 Diana: Conrad told me about how you got shot in the chest that day. 
 Knox: Jim does love to talk. You'd like to see the arrow? I have it inside. 
 Tom: That won't be necessary. 
 Shawn is still at the hospital. He's leaning up against a wall in the hallway, when Nikki appears. 
 Nikki: How's Kyle? 
 Shawn: We don't know yet. 
 Nikki: About last night... 
 Shawn: The kiss. 
 Nikki: That. And other things. We have a lot to talk about. 
 Shawn: No, we don't. 
 Nikki: Shawn. You have a gift. 
 Danny: Nikki. When did you get here? 
 Shawn: How's Kyle? 
 Danny: Still in intensive care but Uncle Tommy says he's stable. Guess whatever they've been doing to him worked. For now, anyway.Listen, l'm starving. You wanna come with us to the cafeteria? 
 Shawn leans back against the wall and doesn't answer. 
 Danny: Yeah. l'll bring you a burrito. 
 Members of the 4400 undergo therapy. The scene flicks in between the therapist talking with various people. 
 Therapist: Why don't we start with something easy. Tell me about your parents. 
 Lily: My parents? They used to argue about money a lot. That was before they split up. 
 Therapist: They divorced? 
 Lily: Yeah, I was 14. 
 Therapist: Do you remember how that made you feel? 
 Shawn: Depressed. Angry, maybe. 
 Therapist: Why don't you tell me about the rest of your family? 
 Richard: They're gone.Got a few cousins outside of St Louis who remember me as a...picture in an old photo album. 
 Lily: My husband married another woman. 
 Shawn: My brother hates that l'm back.What's the point of this? 
 Richard: Look, you wanna help me? Help me find a job. Tell me what to say when they ask me how old l am. Or about my work experience or how to explain tha 50 year gap in my résumé. Everyone says the world has changed for the better, that people don't judge you by your skin.Well let me tell you something, I'm still being judged. You're asking me about my relationship with my parents? 
 Therapist: Let's talk about this hostility that you're manifesting towards me. 
 Danny arrives at Homeland Security and is met in the hallway by Tom. 
 Tom: Danny, you wanted to see me? Thanks, Peter. 
 Danny: So this is where you work? 
 Tom: Yeah. What's up? 
 Danny: I want to talk to you about something, uncle Tommy. 
 Tom: Is it about Shawn? 
 Danny: How did you know? 
 Tom: I'm listening. 
 Danny: He had a fight at school a few weeks ago. He might've killed the guy if I didn't step in. 
 Tom: What did he do to him? 
 Danny: It sounds crazy but... It was like Shawn was draining the life out of him, somehow. I'm not the only one who saw it. 
 Tom: What made you decide to tell me now? 
 Danny: Just thought you should know. 
 Shawn decides to go to Mount Rainier one evening and finds many other members of the 4400 sat on the mountain top. 
 Female: Beautiful, aren't they? I wonder if that's where we were. 
 Shawn: What's everybody doing here? 
 Female: What are you doing here? 
 Shawn: I don't know. I wanted to see it, where we came back. I figured it would be a good place to come and think, to clear my head. 
 Female: Most people come for the conversation. 
 Shawn: There's not a lot of that going on. 
 Female: Give it time. Around 11 o'clock, this place becomes one big group therapy session. 
 A car pulls up and Jordan Collier get's out, along with another man. 
 Collier: I'm sorry to interrupt but l just had to see this myself. My name's Jordan Collier. Some of you may recognise me. If you do, you know I'm one of the 4400, just like you. I'm impressed that you've found each other. And I'm glad that you've come in support of each other. And... I'm cold!And I have to guess that you guys are cold too. I suggest that we continue these get-togethers indoors. I have a place nearby. It's warm, it's spacious. I want to invite all of you to meet me there next Thursday afternoon. You listen to the news, you read the paper, you hear the talk. It seems like the entire world is turning against us. Well, what are we going to do about it? Are we gonna give up? Run and hide? Maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we build a world of our own. 
 Tom and Diana accompany Sherriff Conrad into the woods. 
 Conrad: This is the spot where we found Theresa Baron's body. We went over everything pretty good. 
 Diana: Yeah, well...We have the toys. We like to take them out of the box. 
 Tom: The killer posed her after she was dead? There should have beenblood hand-prints all over. 
 Conrad: It rained that day. The scene was washed clean. 
 Tom: Yeah, but if he dragged her over here,he had to grab onto something. 
 Diana: Tom. 
 Diana has found a fingerprint on a nearby leaf. 
 Tom: I'll be damned. 
 Later that evening they all arrive outside Lopez' house and prepare to enter. 
 Conrad: His name is Philip Lopez. He did 18 years for rape. He was paroled six months ago. 
 Diana: We just got confirmation his prints were found at the scene of Theresa Baron's murder. 
 Tom: Everyone set? Go. 
 They kick the door in and enter. 
 Tom: Lopez! 
 Diana: Tom. 
 They find Lopez hanging from the stairwell. 
 The body is later bagged. 
 Tom: The suicide note says he killed all nine women. Only his time away kept him from doing more. The dates makes sense? 
 Conrad nods. 
 Conrad: Lopez was up here working as seasonal labour during the first round of killings. I guess we owe Oliver Knox an apology. 
 The next day, Knox is secretly taking pictures of a young woman in a video store. He goes into a bar across the street. The barmaid, Felicia, is practising speaking Italian. 
 Knox: Excuse me, can I get a cranberry juice and Seltzer? And...give me another of what he's having. 
 Felicia: Excuse me? Sorry, I'm going to Florence in four days and I didn't want to seem like a tourist when I get there.Ice? 
 Knox: Yeah, a little. 
 Felicia: I studied Italian in college. 
 Knox: Really? 
 He recites in Italian. 
 Felicia: "Beautiful as a sunset over Duomo." 
 Knox: That is very good. You get an A Plus. 
 Felicia: And you get a free round. 
 Staley: Hey Felicia, can I get a beer? 
 Knox: Grazie. 
 He moves to the other end of the bar where Charlie Staley is sitting. 
 Knox: Need a refill, friend? 
 Staley: Thanks. 
 Knox: Listen, I... Listen, I know we don't know each other but I've something to show you. 
 He pulls out a picture of the girl he photographed earlier. 
 Staley: So, what's her name? 
 Knox: I don't know. But...l can tell you something about her. 
 Later that night, the girl can be seen leaving work. The man from the bar whistles as he follows her. 
 Diana returns home from work. The childminder is waiting for her in the living room. 
 Diana: Hello? So sorry I'm late! Hey, Iris, how did we do today? 
 Iris: I can't come back here. 
 Diana: What? Why? 
 Iris: That child. I'm sorry. You'll find someone. 
 Iris leaves and Diana talks with Maia. 
 Maia: I told her we wouldn't be seeing each other for a couple of weeks. 
 Diana: Why did you tell her that? 
 Maia: Because she was gonna be called for jury duty. She thought I was kidding. A few hours later, her husband called. 
 Diana: And she got a summons for jury duty? Well, hey, come here. It's OK, all right? It's OK. 
 Linda walks into Kyle's hospital room and finds Shawn sitting by his bedside. 
 Linda: What are you doing here so late? 
 Shawn: My mom said he was getting worse. 
 Linda: The fluid's building inside his skull again. 
 Shawn: Why did they take me and leave him like this? We were both on the beach that night, I don't understand. I wish I could remember something 'cause I keep thinking, I think it would help. 
 Linda: Tom said you were here the night Kyle had that... jump in his brain activity. He was getting better. And now he's dying. Shawn, did you do something to him? Shawn, tell me. Just talk to me. Please! 
 Shawn: You know I didn't do anything. I told Uncle Tommy. I told you, OK? I gotta go. 
 Richard and Lily are walking in the park, holding hands. 
 Richard: I wish we could talk to a doctor. 
 Lily: And say what? 'My baby may be some kind of alien and, by the way, I know what it's thinking'? That will just get me thrown right back in to quarantine. 
 Richard: I was there today to register our address. 
 Lily: Thanks, I can't stand going back there. 
 Richard: I ran into Gary Branscombe. He had the bed next to mine. He told me about Jordan Collier's get-togethers. 
 Lily: Joe Collier.He's the hotel guy? 
 Richard: Yeah, turns out he's one of us.We should go. 
 Lily: Richard, come on! You can't tell me teenagers didn't make out in 1951 . 
 Richard: Yeah, in a parked car by the lake. 
 Lily: Oh, in a parked car by the lake? That's very cute. 
 Staley from the bar is walking down the main street. His white shirt is covered in blood and he's hearing voices in his head. 
 "Let me tell you somethin' about her... Let me tell you somethin'... I can tell you somethin'... Let me tell you somethin'... Let me tell you somethin'..". 
 He is distressed and jumps out in front of an approaching lorry. The lorry stops just in time. 
 Driver: Are you crazy? Get outta the road! 
 Staley: I killed them. I killed them all. I killed them all. 
 A police officer get's out his gun. 
 Officer: Hands up! Keep your hands up! 
 Tom and Diana are behind a two way mirror talking to the arresting officer as they watch Staley in the other room. 
 Conrad: Gail Keating. She worked at a video store. They found her body in the park this morning. Her blood was all over him.He spoke for five minutes straight, when we brought him in. Confessed to Gail's death and the other nine murders. Not a word since. 
 Diana: George Lopez killed Theresa Baron. He said so in his suicide note, her shirt was in his apartment... 
 Conrad: This morning, Charlie Staley confessed to the same murder. 
 Diana: And they both claim to be behind the original killings? 
 Conrad: Yeah. Only Charlie's 39. He was five years old when the first death happened. 
 Tom: We can eliminate Lopez as a suspect as well. 
 Conrad: How d'you figure that? 
 Tom: Check Lopez's prison records. He was left-handed. The autopsy reports in the 80's show the Friday Harbor killer was right-handed. 
 Diana: So Lopez kills one girl, Staley kills the other, and neither one of them committed the original crimes. 
 Conrad: Why would they confess to murders they couldn't possibly have committed? 
 Conrad leaves. 
 Tom: The pieces don't quite fit together, do they? 
 Diana: Until you add Knox into the puzzle. 
 Tom: He disappears, the killings stop. He came back, they started again. 
 Diana: Let's say Knox is involved somehow. That means what? He's forcing these men to do his murders for him? 
 Tom: Could be. The question is, how? Why have more than one person admit the crimes? One, we'd stop digging. Two gets our attention. 
 Diana: Maybe he can't control everything they do. What if Knox can force people to kill? But only by convincing them they really are the Friday Harbor killers? 
 Tom: In for one murder, in for them all. 
 Members of the 4400 meet at Collier's residence. All have badges on which show their date of abduction. 
 Collier: Hi, welcome. 1969, huh? The good news is, your bell-bottoms are back in style. 
 Collier: Hi. Pleased to meet you. 
 Shawn: There's this guy l was just talking to, he was gone for 40 years. He picked everything up without missing a beat. Then there's me, I'm gone for three years. And it's like my life's fallen apart...everythings different. 
 Collier: I know, Shawn.Remember that most of us feel the same way you do. 
 Shawn: Some of us are more different than others, if you know what l mean. 
 Collier: I'm not sure I do. 
 Shawn: OK. I had this fight with a guy at school, I know it's gonna sound crazy... 
 Collier: I really can't hear the specifics right now. Not yet, anyway. I've a lot of interviews over the next few weeks. I have to be able to deny what I need to. I know you're feeling confused, and I can't blame you. But it sounds to me like you've been given a gift. 
 Shawn: That's what Nikki called it. 
 Collier: Well, Nikki's right, whoever she is. And this gift, don't let it scare you. You will find the right way to use it. 
 Shawn: Ok 
 Collier takes a walk in the gardens and finds Lily standing by a wall. 
 Collier: Well, what can l do for you this afternoon, Lily '93? Don't worry, it's not a line. Though you're the most attractive abductee l've met all afternoon. I'm Jordan Collier. l'm throwing this party. 
 Lily: Oh, nice to meet you. 
 Richard appears with a plate of food. 
 Richard: Here you go. 
 Lily: Thank you. 
 Collier: Do I detect a little romance brewing among the 4400? 
 Richard: You have a good eye. 
 Collier: I'm happy you're getting something positive out of all this. 
 Richard: You're Jordan Collier. 
 Collier: Yes. See? He's not afraid of me. 
 Lily: I'm a little light-headed. It's hot. I should sit down. 
 Collier: Why don't Ifind you a seat? 
 Richard: I'll get some water. 
 Lily: Thank you. 
 Collier: Do you want me to call a doctor? 
 Lily: No, l'm not sick. It'll pass. 
 Richard: Here you go. 
 Lily: That's good. 
 Collier: If you're not sick, then what's...? 
 Lily: It's just morning sickness. 
 Collier: You're pregnant. 
 Lily: First trimester. 
 Collier: Well, that explains it. Congratulations to both of you. Did I say something wrong? 
 Richard: It's a little more complicated... 
 Lily: Richard's not the father. I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted but I was when I got back. Strange, huh? 
 Collier: I interesting, is more like it.Kind of makes you wonder what they had in mind. Whoever took us, I mean. You haven't told your counsellor about this, have you? 
 Lily: We haven't told anyone. 
 Collier: I'd keep it that way for now. Look, how are you guys managing? Have everything you need? 
 Richard: Everything except a job. I was a pilot in the air force, supposed to be drawing a pension. That hasn't come through yet. I've applied for flight instructor jobs, even for Seattle PD. Every time they find out I'm one of the 4400, the job suddenly goes away. 
 Collier: Look. I may have something you'd be interested in. It doesn't involve flying but given your background in the military... My foundation has an opening in the security department. 
 Richard: Foundation? 
 Collier: For the 4400. If you're interested, come by tomorrow and see me. 
 Richard: I'll be there. 
 Collier: Good. 
 Ryland is watching the Barbara Yates show on TV at Homeland Security. 
 Yates: The rash of violence involving the 4400 continues. Sources tell us Homeland Security is investigating a possible connection between the Friday Harbor murders and an undisclosed returnee. 
 Ryland: That hypocritical, self-righteous, irresponsible bitch... 
 Diana: I take it he doesn't like her show. 
 Tom: He doesn't like her. When we were with the FBl, she disclosed the name of a juror in a prosecution. Judge declared a mistrial, three years of work down the drain. 
 Ryland: You know, she blindsided me once. That is not going to happen again. 
 
 
 
 Tom's phone rings. 
 Tom: Tom Baldwin...Yes, Sheriff..... I see....We'll be there. 
 He put's down the phone. 
 Tom: That was Conrad. He got another letter. 
 They go back to Friday Harbor. 
 Conrad: 'I decide who lives and who dies. My judgement is final and more verdicts are coming.' mThe date's clipped from this morning's paper. Couldn't have been composed by Charlie Staley. Not from jail. 
 Tom: Are you telling us, this letter's from the Friday Harbor killer? 
 Conrad: It's genuine. lt describes wound patterns on the original victims. We kept that private. If you believe Knox is involved, why's he out there walking around? Let's pick him up, right now. 
 Tom: We can't. The bottom line is, we need to know exactly how he's linked to these murders to bring him in. 
 Conrad: So what do we do? Wait for another girl to turn up dead? 
 Tom: I think we can do better than that. 
 Knox drives into a garage. 
 Mitchell: $27.75, your change. 
 Knox: Thank you. 
 He hands him a picture of Felicia. 
 Mitchell: What's this? 
 Knox: Let me tell you something about her. Her name's Felicia. She works over at the bar... 
 TV Reporter Barbara Yates is called to Homeland Security for a meeting with Ryland. 
 Yates: Well, I was expecting a scolding on the phone. Maybe a tax audit. Not an invitation into the belly of the beast. 
 Ryland: Consider it a tribute to your bully pulpit. 
 Yates: I'm flattered. 
 Ryland: Don't be. DC is calling for your head. I want you to dial back on the 4400. 
 Yates: Not gonna happen. l'm a journalist, I answer to my viewers. 
 Ryland: Don't hide behind freedom of the press. You shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre. And you're gonna stop before the stampede begins. 
 Yates: Yeah, you have a really strong face. Seriously Dennis, you should come on my show. 
 Ryland: You're getting in the way of my job. And if you're gonna continue interfering with Homeland Security, I'd advise you to tread lightly. 
 Yates: And what are you gonna do? Disappear me? 
 Ryland: I asked for your cooperation. 
 Yates: I've chosen not to give it. 
 Ryland: Fair enough. Don't forget to get your parking validated on the way out. 
 Richard meets with Collier in the grounds of the Collier mansion. 
 Richard: This healthcare plan is incredible. 
 Collier: The cover should provide for all your doctor's visits and hospital care once the baby's born. 
 Richard: Mr Collier, I don't know what to say. 
 Collier: Say you'll take the job? 
 The phone rings. 
 Collier: I'm sorry, I have to take this... Len?......Good, good...The whole property?..... Excellent. 26 million......Yes, I want you to close. Don't worry about the board of directors. They voted me back in as CEO when I returned. I'll handle them. Call me when it's done. OK. 
 He put's the phone down. 
 Collier: Real estate deals.They're never over till they're over. So, are you going to come to work for me or not? 
 Richard: I can start tomorrow. 
 Ryland meets with the head of the TV company, in a park. 
 Gibson: Mr Ryland, Phil Gibson. This is an honour. Barbara will be very disappointed she wasn't able to meet with you herself. 
 Ryland: Actually, I prefer to speak to you. 
 Gibson: Great. First, just let me say, sir, any information you give us about the 4400 will never be traced back to you. 
 Ryland: I'm glad to hear that. I've something important to pass on. 
 Gibson: Mind if I tape this? 
 Ryland: Quick and simple. I want Barbara Yates's coverage of the 4400 to stop. 
 Gibson: What do you mean stop? 
 Ryland: I mean it ends. She stops covering the story, period. 
 Gibson: Listen, Mr Ryland, Barbara has sole authority over her editorial content. Barbara says what Barbara wants. There's nothing I can do about it. 
 Ryland: You're her producer. Produce. 
 Gibson: I don't think you don't know what it's like in this business these days. We're not Walter Cronkite you know. 
 Ryland: You want to talk about the old days? In the old days, I would need a warrant to tap all your phones, to freeze all your assets, and to prevent you from ever being a passenger on any airline in the world. But like you say, it's not the old days any more. You've worked for Barbara Yates since the beginning. I'm guessing you knowwhere the bodies are buried. Draw me a map. 
 Shawn is walking alone at night and remembering back to the night he was taken. 
 **Flashback** 
 Kyle: I bet my Dad will kick your ass if I come home smelling of beer. 
 Shawn: Evil cousin Shawn, corruptor of the innocent. 
 For the first time we see what happened to Kyle. Bright tendricles ensnare his head and he is screaming. Shawn stands back looking on, unable to help. 
 Kyle: Help! Help me, Shawn! 
 Shawn rushes to help and pushes Kyle away. Grabbed then himself by the tendricles he begins to scream. 
 **End Flashback** 
 Shawn: Oh, my God! 
 The next morning, Felicia is out for a run in the woods, when Mitchell stops her. 
 Mitchell: Excuse me.I lost my dog. Can you help me find him? 
 Felicia: I haven't seen him. 
 Mitchell: A wire-haired terrier named Boss. 
 Felicia: I haven't seen him. 
 He stops her from getting past him. 
 Felicia: Would you let me by? This isn't funny. I'll scream. 
 Mitchell: Yes, you will. 
 As she screams and tries to run, the man get's out a knife. Tom and Conrad appear with guns. 
 Tom: Don't move! 
 Mitchell: Felicia has to die! She has to! 
 Mitchell is taken back to Homeland Security where he is interviewed. Tom holds up a picture of Mitchell and Knox on the garage forecourt. 
 Tom: This man. What did he say to you, Mr Mitchell? 
 Mitchell: You've been following me? 
 Tom: No. Actually, we were following Knox. 
 Diana: I really like the composition of this shot, its nice, cosy symmetry. 
 Tom: Now, what did he say to you? 
 Mitchell doesn't answer, so Tom turns to the others. 
 Tom: You keep at him. We'll bring in Knox, sit him next to his friend. See what they have to say to each other. 
 Tom and Diana leave as Conrad takes a seat opposite Mitchel. 
 Knox's house. 
 Tom: Knox! Open up! 
 Diana: Tom! 
 Tom: Knox! 
 They go around the back of the house and enter. Mitchell isn't there, but they find the house full of lit candles. On the wall, scrawled in blood, are the words, 'Felicia Must Die'. 
 Tom: Are the police at the girl's house? 
 Diana: She refused an escort. 
 Felicia enters her house. The phone is ringing and she answers it. 
 Felicia: Hello. Hello? 
 She put's down the phone. As she turns she see's Knox standing beside her. 
 Knox: Excuse me. I lost my dog. Can you help me find him? He's awire-haired terrier, his name's Boss. 
 She runs to another room and slams the door. He get's in another door and grabs her, but she smashes a vase over his head and runs. She gets out onto the balcony and he follows her. As police cars draw up below, he grabs her by the throat and has a knife in his hand. 
 Felicia: Somebody help me! 
 Diana: Let her go, Knox! 
 Conrad: Knox! Get away from her or l'll shoot. 
 Knox drags Felicia back through the house. Tom bursts in and hit's him in the face. 
 Knox: l think you broke my nose. 
 Tom: Stay down! 
 Knox: You got me wrong. Let me tell you... 
 Tom: Not a word, not a word. Now, I'm warning you. 
 Later at Homeland Security. Tom and Diana speak with Marco from the theory room. 
 Tom: Goddamn serial killer. This guy murders eight people before he's abducted. They send him back, he picks up where he left off. 
 Marco: In '83, Knox was your garden variety psychopath. They sent him back enhanced. Big difference. 
 Diana: Well, it makes whoever took him sound pretty nasty. 
 Tom: They also sent back Shawn. And Maia. 
 Diana: Yes, I know. For that, l'd like to thank them. But it all seems so random. 
 Marco: Maybe. Until you start to look at the bigger picture. Orson Bailey kills Adam Kensington. Revenge murder. Open and shut. Carl Morrissey's a well-intentioned but hapless vigilante who ends up dead. 
 Diana: Like I said, random. 
 Marco: Yeah, but we know Kensington's company was perpetrating a massive fraud. We've learned that since Morrissey's death, his neighbours formed a committee protecting the park. Anyone starting to see a pattern? 
 Diana: What? You're talking about some kind of ripple effect? 
 Marco: Diana skouris, to the head of the class. 
 Diana: The incidents themselves are just catalysts for change. Positive change in these two cases. 
 Tom: What? Wait a minute. Whoever sent them back planned for these changes to take place? What about the Knox killings There's nothing positive with them. 
 Diana: Or maybe we haven't seen the ripples yet. 
 Knox is being held in a glass cage in the centre of the room. A cleaner is nearby washing the floors. 
 Knox: Excuse me. Hey...I have something I wanna tell you. Hey... I have something I wanna tell you! 
 He doesn't realise that the cage has been soundproofed. 
 Diana is at home watching television. Maia is asleep on the sofa. 
 Reporter: Police aren't saying who released this closely-guarded secret. A document containing the names and addresses of all the 4400 has appeared on the internet and is now posted on more than 20 sites. Authorities won't confirm the leak but efforts to shut down the sites, with an emergency injunction, suggest the list is genuine. We'll have more on this breaking story as it develops. 
 Tom arrives at the hospital to find Shawn in Kyle's room. 
 Tom: What are you doing here, Shawn? 
 As Shawn moves away from the bed, Kyle can be seen sitting up, awake. 
 Tom: Kyle? 
 Kyle: How long......have I been in the dark? 
 The End
