 Previously on The 4400 . 
 I have blackouts. 
 If you lose track of time, you have to tell it your father. 
 What can he do with it, bring me to NTAC? 
 Let's see if I understand correctly. 
 You fell in love and were together for eight years ... 
 in a species different reality? 
 Liv, you were yesterday pretty far away. 
 If I take an overdose, that is no great loss. 
 Maybe I can save you. 
 What it is, there is a solution. 
 Easy for you to talk. 
 You do not know what it is. 
 Get down. 
 You got me all right told about that night, huh? 
 Yes. 
 If you want time to clear your head  a short break to be able to think  I can arrange that. 
 Dad, I had to go. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Excuses do not interest me. 
 It is I could not care how you do it and with whose help. 
 Get him out of jail and from Los Angeles Airport. 
 I want him on the first plane. 
 -Skouris, where Baldwin? 
 He's not there yet. 
 Why? 
 What is going on? 
 Police stop a criminal solid  who wants out of prison. 
 He knows who Collier-sold the murder weapon. 
 -Who does the interrogation in LA? 
 -No. 
 Let me bring him here for questioning. 
 I have a good feeling about. 
 There will be my partner happy. 
 Inform me if I'm at the office. 
 I know we have the champagne can not get shot  but this witness has new information  certain details about Collier-murder weapon. 
 It looks like we finally lucky. 
 I have to go. 
 Are you okay? 
 You sound a little absent. 
 Private business. 
 Do not worry. 
 -What time did you at the office? 
 -I do not know yet. 
 I take contact as soon as possible, okay? 
 -Well, no problem. 
 Day. 
 -How long has this been going on? 
 -Calm down, huh? 
 I ask you something. 
 How long? 
 Kyle me told a month ago. 
 -Can you remember that night? 
 -What ... 
 Which night? 
 When he was nearly arrested for smashing that window. 
 When he was drunk? 
 He never said he was drunk. 
 You said. 
 Kyle said he had a blackout. 
 What? 
 Then it's another happened and few times. 
 One moment he is somewhere  the following in a different place. 
 He never told me, never said anything. 
 He has tried, but you did not listen. 
 You had me about inform, Danny. 
 He's your cousin and your friend. 
 So-So I kept my mouth. 
 Kyle wanted absolutely not again in quarantine. 
 Danny, Kyle yesterday not come home. 
 If you know where he is, please say it. 
 He's staying with Shawn on the 4400 center. 
 -Beautiful. 
 -Hey, Uncle Tommy. 
 You still need to know something. 
 Kyle thinks he has done what during a blackout. 
 He did not say what  but seemed really to care. 
 This is the last Recommendation 's Committee. 
 A 37-year-old plumber from Detroit. 
 4 months ago he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's. 
 -When we get him? 
 -Over two days. 
 Shawn. 
 Where is he? 
 Who, Kyle? 
 Not here. 
 No games, Shawn. 
 Could we, Lucy? 
 Thank you. 
 Danny said that Kyle was here. 
 Danny should read his text messages. 
 Kyle has not been here. 
 You're not listening. 
 I want my son. 
 You do not listen to me. 
 He is not here. 
 Do you I hid it in the basement? 
 -I can see you for to. 
 -My God. 
 Uncle Tommy. 
 It's not my fault Kyle is struggling. 
 -That would not be the first time. 
 -He's not here. 
 He is not here. 
 Kyle? 
 Thomas. 
 This comes from a village outside Barcelona. 
 They said it was something special. 
 What is it? 
 Kyle said anything about this. 
 I am in any case not the only one who knows nothing. 
 According to the doctors he was okay when he came out of quarantine. 
 True, but he has three years ... 
 lived with another spirit that was in him. 
 The doctors did not what she had. 
 Did you call the police? 
 I do not want to involve them for I know what Kyle did. 
 And Linda? 
 Who has not heard from him. 
 She promises that they call. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 -I'm glad I'm back. 
 -Yes. 
 Where are you going? 
 If I sit, I find him not. 
 I go along. 
 No. 
 I prefer you to stay by the phone. 
 If he calls ... 
 you're there. 
 Okay. 
 I'll keep you informed. 
 That guy is a high media consultant. 
 He is much more. 
 Keith Petrick has trained presidents  and MPs. 
 A call Sky News is worth. 
 a few hours of homework  What will he teach me? 
 How I can say otherwise that we are not a cult? 
 No, he trains you how brings a consistent message. 
 The British press loves slipping. 
 Keith, Matthew Ross. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 -This is Shawn Farrell. 
 To make. 
 -Nice to meet you  Shawn. 
 Hold on, sorry. 
 Uncle Tommy has been with me. 
 I thought so He has also been here. 
 -What did you tell him? 
 -The truth. 
 Kyle has dumped us. 
 He did not come. 
 Maybe he still is. 
 -Yet? 
 -Yes. 
 I love to show you around, but ... 
 It is quite busy, I understand. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Hey, Liv. 
 This is Danny, my brother. 
 -Hello. 
 -Hi. 
 -This is Liv, a first key. 
 Meanwhile, second-Key. 
 Really? 
 What is good, great class. 
 Do you think you can lead around him? 
 Shawn, you do not need this ... 
 I want you to see it here. 
 Is it okay? 
 -Okay? 
 -Yes, of course. 
 Nice, have fun together. 
 I gotta get back to work. 
 That's my brother, Always the world 't save. 
 Someone has to do it. 
 -Ready? 
 -I am at your disposal. 
 Come on. 
 I know who the gun the Collier-murder has sold. 
 That's a start. 
 Do we have a name? 
 Victor Rios. 
 R-l-O-S. 
 He lives on Sumac Drive 43207. 
 -S-U-M-A-C. 
 -Yes, I got it, thank you. 
 I was there last month. 
 He was all excited and waved that gun. 
 Like he's resurrection was Tony Montana. 
 He wanted to exchange for some of my drugs. 
 I said I was not interested. 
 Can you describe the weapon, Mr. 
 Kovec? 
 I saw how he put it together. 
 .50 Caliber. 
 I never saw such big bullets. 
 It had a huge visor  as a sign that said: "I touch everything."  Why do you think that this was the Collier-gun? 
 The next time I saw Rios  he ran to brag about the price he had received. 
 That was about  two days before Collier was killed. 
 I think that's a coincidence. 
 And according to you? 
 I said a quick tour, and two hours later ... 
 Yes, it is a good guide. 
 They know fine to sell. 
 Danny expected bald heads and dresses. 
 There was not a tambourine. 
 -Disappointed? 
 Hear-me you do not complain. 
 Listen, big boss, like your  staff in the evening off the farm? 
 I invited Liv out for a party, but they dare not ask. 
 See her but as a missionary. 
 The campus of North Mount is full of potential recruits. 
 Can be fun. 
 I've been so long on the Centre. 
 I think it's a good idea. 
 Sorry, man. 
 Find someone else. 
 -You watch her or something? 
 -Danny. 
 You may as long here act together if you want. 
 But a student party is a different story. 
 The wise, mighty Shawn has spoken. 
 I hear and obey you, Your Majesty. 
 I'm serious. 
 Since when did Shawn a problem with student parties? 
 Since he believes that he is the Messiah. 
 What time is the party? 
 Good. 
 I was in the middle of the night awake and there was Kyle. 
 He sat on his haunches in the hallway. 
 -No idea how he got there. 
 -That's right. 
 I sent him. 
 You were ... 
 you were afraid, that makes sense. 
 He was much frightened. 
 He had to seek help from me. 
 I told him there with you needed to talk about. 
 Did he do it but did. 
 We had it been solved. 
 He wanted to. 
 What stopped him? 
 Mr. 
 Baldwin, your relationship with your son  is not my business. 
 True, but if you want something have to say, then do it. 
 I'm sure Kyle loves you  but he did not. 
 Trusts  -Did he say that? 
 -Sort of. 
 Eggs, butter, walnuts, cocoa powder. 
 Who said bake brownies that was hard? 
 Remember the oven preheat to 175 degrees. 
 Now it gets really complicated. 
 Quiet, I'm just kidding. 
 Yes? 
 Now? 
 No, that's not a problem. 
 I just need to arrange a babysitter. 
 If it fails, I'll call you back. 
 Sorry, honey. 
 I have to work. 
 -I'll call Mrs. 
 Skalka ... 
 -Do not go, Mommy. 
 Or ... 
 they can come watch. 
 I have. 
 We make another time brownies. 
 That man  you should not get. 
 What man? 
 That man you're trying to find. 
 There will hit anyone hurt. 
 Who? 
 Is it someone with whom I work? 
 I do not know, but you should not go. 
 -Are you worried about me? 
 -Do not go. 
 Do you think I to the border to drive? 
 Let you put on a different matter. 
 Another let the risk. 
 That's not an option. 
 -Tom know it already? 
 -No. 
 He does not work for a while to the case. 
 For his health is also found better. 
 She said that someone get hurt, but not who. 
 I do not know. 
 Maia's visions are usually not so vague. 
 This was a vision where her mother was involved. 
 Maybe she wants Not see it clearly. 
 Here I'm not going to feel better. 
 Okay. 
 And this? 
 -Better? 
 -Yes, you know. 
 Do you recognize this man, Mrs. 
 Rios? 
 That was a customer of your spouse. 
 Husband? 
 Through him I got my green card and a lot of song and a dance. 
 Just ask Victor. 
 If you can find it. 
 That's the problem, Mrs. 
 Rios. 
 Your husband is out of the country. 
 We know he is in Puerto Rico. 
 You see? 
 You know more than I do. 
 He not say that he left? 
 -I have not seen him for weeks. 
 I gotta get back to work. 
 A month ago sold your man this guy a weapon. 
 Your husband is involved in murder. 
 This does not look good for you. 
 Especially if you your green card appreciates. 
 Look back at the drawing. 
 WANTED FOR INTERROGATION  ON MURDER COLLIER  That hat I remember it. 
 No regular customer. 
 He's only been one time along. 
 He has that big gun bought and gun. 
 What gun? 
 You know, some 9-millimeter weapon. 
 Do you remember anything? 
 He was young, in the 20, very quiet. 
 He was a few minutes here and left by taxi. 
 -How do you know that? 
 -That I had called for him. 
 We want to have that number. 
 We were in the middle in a biology lab. 
 Kyle stood up, said he so was back, and that was it. 
 Day. 
 -We saw him until the next day. 
 What time did he leave? 
 Around 19:00 or 20:00 at most. 
 He's got it wrong again. 
 Rather, it was 18:00. 
 We made it out of shortly after Kyle'm smeared. 
 Well, I ... 
 Does anyone remember what day it was? 
 -Late last month, right? 
 -The 25th. 
 -Are you sure? 
 -Yes. 
 When I got to my room  it was on the news. 
 The murder of Jordan Collier. 
 Baldwin. 
 Can we have our tomorrow look forward to your presence? 
 I hope so but it is doubtful. 
 Doubtful I do not accept that. 
 We almost got him. 
 There are good indications. 
 I need you here. 
 What kind of evidence? 
 You wanna know? 
 Come to your work. 
 Thomas, it could be anyone. 
 No, look good and then say that he did not appear. 
 This is madness. 
 Why would Kyle Like murder? 
 Collier  If it's during such blackout was done, there was no reason. 
 Not if the future the most important prophet wanted dead. 
 Think he again was in their power? 
 Yes, they manipulate his behavior if he is a puppet. 
 Anything is possible. 
 In that case, he was not sane. 
 Possessed by other beings, Alana? 
 That not. 
 Believe the jury  What do they want from Kyle? 
 Four years of his life, that was not enough? 
 They got us warned, remember? 
 They said that a crisis was coming. 
 Does that make it less bad? 
 They have warned me? 
 They did not say that she is a murderer my son started making. 
 -There must be a reason. 
 They do not, Defend-Alana. 
 They have used me. 
 All of us, Kyle and Shawn. 
 I've had enough. 
 I love him. 
 I know, Alana. 
 But ... 
 I need to find him before NTAC find him. 
 I need to find him. 
 Stop it. 
 This is a serious matter. 
 Give your answers to how far you'll get in the center. 
 If security sees us, they throw us out. 
 Is that far enough? 
 Okay, question number one:  Did you have fun tonight? 
 Are you happy we have ignored? 
 Shawn  That's two questions. 
 You should think about your answers. 
 -Do not say aloud. 
 -Good. 
 -Rules are rules. 
 -Okay. 
 Are we ready? 
 Question number two:  Want the evening all over? 
 If you answered to question two is "no"  do your glasses and take your medicine. 
 "Percocet". 
 Where did you get this? 
 Of the party. 
 Your size was talking in 't medicine cabinet. 
 Did you steal it? 
 What is happening here? 
 This space is closed. 
 Thank you very much, Mrs. 
 Skalka. 
 I could not sleep. 
 Because of me? 
 I am back home, baby. 
 Do not worry. 
 Say, about that case I'm working on? 
 Can you tell what you have seen even more? 
 Whatever? 
 Because if you are not telling me something ... 
 I've told you everything. 
 Do not believe me? 
 -Of course. 
 Are you going to work tomorrow? 
 Honey, that's my job. 
 Can I now go to sleep? 
 Of course. 
 Here. 
 MARCUS CHASE BROKER  Linda, have you anything heard from Kyle? 
 No, otherwise I would have called. 
 I was hoping you had heard anything. 
 Linda, you talk as often. 
 In the divorce papers was not that she could not. 
 If you have any idea where he might be ... 
 You think I'm not telling anything? 
 You're the one with secrets. 
 You're his mother. 
 Logical that protects him. 
 Of course. 
 But why he still lives with you? 
 Protect him was your specialty. 
 Give me alone to blame. 
 But I must find Kyle. 
 And if he does not want Find him? 
 In my opinion he is in deep trouble. 
 
 
 
 What is it, Tom? 
 What did he do? 
 Give me at least a hint. 
 You do not really know. 
 Like I said ... 
 you are the one with secrets. 
 -Hello? 
 -Kyle, I just talked your father. 
 You did not say where was I? 
 You came to me because you did not want to go back to NTAC. 
 That's what you said. 
 Mom, I can not talk about it. 
 That's not the whole story, huh? 
 -Please, Mom. 
 -Tell me what's going on. 
 Would you excuse me? 
 Of course. 
 -Thank you. 
 Do not say: "There you go."  Well, I was right. 
 Give Danny not to blame. 
 It was my fault. 
 I got lost. 
 I had a few beers and ... 
 You should not drink beer, Liv. 
 You should not take. 
 A month ago had you hooked. 
 Stop it with the sermon. 
 I've already packed my bags. 
 If you want to stop, I can not stop you. 
 But if you want to stay  and you can promise me that it never happens again  you're welcome as first key. 
 I'm second key. 
 Not any more. 
 Mr. 
 Farrell, it takes a long time? 
 No, come inside. 
 I have a stack written new songs. 
 Maybe I should they once heard. 
 Yeah, we'll see. 
 All passengers for San Francisco  now boarding on track 1. 
 I do not know him better than you, but we'll talk. 
 And he needs you told his hideout? 
 No, but you are looking for All logical places and ... 
 Kyle loves privacy. 
 You may know him still better than me. 
 No, no. 
 I did not believe it. 
 I always hoped that I was wrong. 
 Thomas, this does not Kyle himself. 
 Since you have to keep thinking. 
 Wait, do not turn around. 
 Alana, take this and hide in the house. 
 -What are you doing? 
 -I go back to work. 
 Okay, I would have dropped off here. 
 Garrity, get a warrant to search. 
 these lockers  Look at who's back from his retirement, huh? 
 Good timing, Baldwin. 
 Your partner brings you up to date. 
 If you have at least plan to continue. 
 I'm there. 
 We know that two days before the murder  the suspect at this station was with a bag full of firearms. 
 From here he could go anywhere. 
 We also study All subway lines. 
 We talk suitcase with boys, card vendors,  -Bus drivers ... 
 -Sounds good. 
 A cobbler has the man recognized on our sketch. 
 He helped our man to change for a safe. 
 -Do what he safe? 
 -Somewhere in that corner. 
 With all the people in a month use lockers  the chances are approximately 1 in 10,000 that we discover something useful. 
 So why do we bother? 
 You never know. 
 We only have a fingerprint. 
 -We can only hope. 
 -Yes. 
 Is it? 
 Maia had another vision. 
 She says someone gets hurt if we catch this guy. 
 She said who? 
 Welcome back. 
 -Is Tom there? 
 -No. 
 You must Alana. 
 I'm Linda. 
 I know that. 
 My interview? 
 I do not see it. 
 I did it badly. 
 Bad I would not say directly  but more eye contact and clearer would have been better. 
 formulate  But you did not say terrible things  And that is quite something. 
 -I was not there. 
 Just before Liv was with me, and we had something ... 
 Because you banned junk that go out with your brother. 
 Ex-junkie. 
 I want her just protect more. 
 That's part of the story. 
 You think I'm jealous of Danny? 
 You know a relationship that girl really can not. 
 Matthew, you like me all give advice on the Centre ... 
 but that's it. 
 You do not understand. 
 You're the Centre. 
 All of you, everything you do. 
 You can not inappropriate relationship afford. 
 Jordan Collier was crazy in inappropriate relationships. 
 Every girl here was fair game for him. 
 There's another reason to not to repeat his mistakes. 
 Which girl is good enough for the great Shawn Farrell? 
 I'll let you know when you meet her. 
 And now more important things. 
 I wish I had time to make. 
 that safe clean  It is perhaps under Kyles fingerprints. 
 -We have to help him out of town. 
 -The country. 
 Linda said nothing else to you? 
 Something they did not want to tell me? 
 -No, she's just as scared as we are. 
 I felt guilty I lied to her. 
 The fewer people know the truth, the better. 
 I know how hopeless she feels. 
 Her son is gone, they want information  and she has only a farewell note of three lines. 
 Did you tell her about the note? 
 No. 
 She did it himself. 
 I never told her. 
 Kyle. 
 Dad? 
 Kyle, wait. 
 Dammit. 
 Stop. 
 -Let go of me, Dad. 
 -Enough. 
 Enough. 
 Enough, Kyle. 
 I stood on the roof Collier and saw through it visor  how they felt tractor when I persuaded him  how his body turned hit the ground  I remember everything  but it feels if the memory of another. 
 That's it. 
 You had no power about your behavior, Kyle. 
 You have Jordan Collier not kill. 
 Since that day I had no blackouts more. 
 Would it be over? 
 Let's hope. 
 How long will I go to jail? 
 Kyle, I will not let that happen  for something you did not do. 
 -Do you hear me? 
 -Yes. 
 Only ... 
 I really wanted you  me immediately had said something about those blackouts. 
 You tried it, but I did not listen. 
 That's nothing new, Dad. 
 I know I do not always was for you, Kyle, but I ... 
 I thought we Had a good relationship. 
 That is true. 
 Only ... 
 Growing up with a father who works for the FBI and NTAC  that's pretty intense, you know? 
 -You mean I'm violently. 
 -Sometimes you're just scary. 
 -You do not believe, ask me the mom. 
 -That's okay, I believe you. 
 I'm sorry, Dad. 
 Me too. 
 Hey, baby. 
 -Kyle. 
 -Hi. 
 I have some stuff packed for you. 
 The rest ... 
 We-buy it in Brussels. 
 -Okay. 
 -How do you fly? 
 -12.00. 
 Go check at the airport. 
 There it is safer. 
 I have this friend emailed, He takes us as we land. 
 -He will take good care of Kyle. 
 -Okay. 
 -Do your mom hello? 
 Of course. 
 I'll give her the news Gently tell. 
 I'll be your look up as soon as possible, Kyle. 
 -That would be nice. 
 -Good. 
 -I love you. 
 -I also yours. 
 Day. 
 Okay. 
 -Thanks, Dad. 
 -Yes. 
 It's good. 
 Alana  take good care of him, okay? 
 -Will do, Thomas. 
 Will do. 
 -Thank you. 
 So far we have 60 grams of hashish found some illegal DVDs  and three toilet bags of people bathe in the station toilet. 
 I hope for a picture Collier with a large "X" on it  and chock full of beautiful prints. 
 Yes. 
 Everything okay at home? 
 If you need to arrange something it is now a good time. 
 I stay here just in case there emerges something. 
 Thanks, I ... 
 I'll stay here. 
 Skouris. 
 When did that happen? 
 No, here we come. 
 That was Jarvis. 
 She just got a call from desk West. 
 There is just arrested a suspect. 
 According to them, it's him. 
 Roy Keith Marsden, 25, unemployed. 
 Endangered Collier after his uncle had come. 
 at 4400 Centre  And please note: he has a .50 caliber JLHP6. 
 Alana, let it sit flight. 
 Let Kyle home. 
 There is a suspect arrested in the Collier-murder case. 
 If you're here with me to sermons because Liv, forget it. 
 What happened, your fault was not mine. 
 You had me can warn about  her drug problem. 
 I would have pulled me. 
 If you expect me to apologize tender and kiss your robe  then you have come to nothing. 
 Since I did not. 
 I do not want this is inflated, okay? 
 When we were little, we always fought like crazy. 
 Constantly. 
 And the next day we were 't forgotten. 
 Then everything was normal. 
 It was that simple. 
 There's nothing wrong with simple. 
 Are you standing there or can you give me a hand? 
 By car? 
 I was never more cars, as I have for my people. 
 -Oh, yeah? 
 -Yes. 
 Well, not me, so grab a sponge. 
 You see ... 
 I should have known I would be wet. 
 Way to go, kid. 
 Get your hands dirty once again. 
 -Certainly long ago, huh? 
 -Yes. 
 You brush, I rinse it off. 
 Come on. 
 -Hey, sweetheart. 
 -Hi. 
 I know you've already eaten. 
 But we will those brownies try again? 
 -Good. 
 -Beautiful. 
 -How was your day? 
 -Pretty good. 
 Beautiful. 
 Ask you how mine was? 
 We have the man caught we were looking for, and guess what? 
 There is no one got hurt. 
 You see, nothing to be worry about. 
 It's over. 
 Not yet.
