Directed by VINCENT MISIANO 
 **Previously on The 4400** 
 Flashbacks to previous episodes. 
 Diana tells Tom that Maia is still having visions. 
 Lily turns up at her home for the first time after being abducted. 
 Shawn warns Collier about going near Isabelle. 
 Wendy tells Kyle that he should seek help regarding his blackouts. 
 **Present** 
 Shawn is racing down the stairs at the center. 
 Male: Shawn, we need you! 
 Jordan is on the floor in the foyer, writhing in pain. Shawn rushes to him and holds his head in his hands. 
 Shawn: Jordan? 
 He uses his power to heal him.Later they sit and talk. 
 Collier: You don't have to keep visual, Shawn. 
 Shawn: Are you going to cancel the appearance at River Front Park? 
 Collier: No. That would be a mistake. They're not just honouring me, they're honouring the center and all the work we've done. 
 Shawn: A new neurological clinic just opened in Atlanta. 
 Collier: Now look, look.... 
 Shawn: Shhh! 
 Collier: I've been to all the specialists Shawn. There's no name for what I have. 
 Shawn: We can't just give up. There's gotta be a way to figure out what that baby did to you. 
 Collier: I know what that baby did to me. It saved my life. 
 Shawn: What? What are you talking about? 
 Collier: When I touched Lily's pregnant belly and was hit with that pain, I realised I'd been judged and found wanting. 
 Shawn: By a baby that wasn't even born yet? 
 Collier: In that moment, I was forced to see the truth about myself. About my motives towards the 4400. And they were....not pure. 
 Shawn: That baby tried to kill you. 
 Collier: And it succeeded. It killed the old Jordan Collier and I was reborn. Pure of purpose. All I've done since, everything I've built, I owe to Richard, to Lily and to that child. 
 Richard and Lily are in a room. There's a knock at the doo. 
 Richard: I'll get it. 
 He answers the door to find Heidi and her father standing there. 
 Richard: Hey! 
 Brian: Hi! 
 Richard: Come in! 
 They enter the room. 
 Richard: Lily! Look who's here! 
 Lily get's to her feet holding Isabelle 
 Brian: We would have called but Heidi wanted to surprise you. 
 Lily: Heidi. 
 Heidi: Hi Mom. She's so cute. 
 Brian: Now that you guys are living on the block, I figured it was time for Heidi to meet her real mom. 
 Heidi turns to Richard. 
 Heidi: And that makes you my second Dad. 
 Richard laughs. 
 Richard: I guess so. 
 Sounds of Lily crying can be heard, although Lily is not crying in the scene. 
 Heidi: Mom, why are you crying? 
 Brian: Lily are you alright? 
 Richard and Brian: Lily? 
 Lily wakes up from the dream. They're still in the car. 
 Richard: Lily. Lily. Sweetheart, wake up! 
 Lily: It was a dream. 
 Richard: More like a nightmare. 
 Lily: Oh no. We were living next door to Heidi and Brian. We were all getting along and the house, Richard, it was so pretty. 
 Richard: Well why were you crying? 
 Lily: Guess I knew it wasn't real. How long can we keep going before someone catches up to us? 
 Richard: We just gotta keep moving. Stay ahead of Collier and NTAC. 
 Lily: I'm just so tired of running. 
 Richard: We're gonna find a place to stop running. It's out there. Gotta be. 
 Fairview, Washington 
 A young boy is playing the violin while a girl accompanies him on the piano. Their teacher is Heather Tobey, one of the 4400 who disappeared on March 2nd 1974. She watches their performance and smiles. She then wanders through the classroom where many children are concentrating on different things. Painting, music etc. She bends down to a young girl who is painting. 
 Heather: You've come so far. That's so good. 
 She walks up to another boy who is also painting. 
 Heather: Nice use of colour. 
 Another boy is sitting at a table drawing a comic strip. 
 Heather: It's shaping up great, but I think it could use some work. 
 Greg: That's as good as it gets. 
 He show's no interest and continues to read his magazine. Heather kneels beside him and looks into his eyes, whilst placing her hand on his shoulder. 
 Greg: Don't waste your time. 
 The Head Teacher [Herman] walks into the room accompanied by a sheriff. 
 Herman: Miss Tobey? Would you come with us please? 
 Child: What's the sheriff doing here? 
 They walk out into the hallway. 
 Heather: Herman! Herman! Sam! What's this all about. 
 Sam [Sheriff]: Miss Tobey, I'm placing you under arrest. 
 The other officer places her in handcuffs while the children look on. 
 Heather: Arrest? For what? 
 Sam: Child abuse. 
 Heather: Oh my God! 
 Titles   
 Susan is at Toms house. She sits at a table while Tom walks in from the kitchen and pours her some coffee. 
 Tom: Look, you know the kids birth certificate say's that he's 21. But emotionally, Kyle is still a teenager. We gotta accept the fact that he's gonna screw up and be a teenager. 
 Susan: He'll learn from his mistakes. Get it out of his system. But Shawn....It's been a year. How could he cut us out like that? 
 Tom: Danny, he's eating himself up inside. He used to be such a sweet boy. 
 Tom: Yeah, I remember what Pop used to say. If you think you've got problems, wait till you become a parent. 
 Susan: Little did we know. 
 Kyle and Danny are in Kyle's bedroom playing videogames. 
 Kyle: You know, I bet they're talking about us downstairs. 
 Danny: That's what they live for. If they didn't have us to worry about, they'd die of boredom. Seen you around campus. 
 Kyle: Saw you too. Why didn't you say something? 
 Danny: It's been like, four years. I mean, what was I supposed to say? Welcome back from coma world? I don't know, I guess seeing you reminded me of Shawn. You two were always so tight. 
 Kyle: And you were like our shadow. Where you going? Can I come too? 
 Danny: I thought you guys were so cool. I was 14, what did I know? Mom say's you talked to him? 
 Kyle: I don't think he heard me. 
 Danny: Yeah. I used to blame Shawn for everything. Stealing Nikki, running out on us the way he did. Breaking Mom's heart. But it wasn't his fault. The b*st*rd's who took him, sent him back a freak. They're the one's. 
 Kyle: Guess they screwed us all up. 
 Collier is making a speech, in a park. 
 Collier: Well I want to thank Councilman Lowe on behalf of the 4400 center, for this wonderful offer. In funding this clean up project, I wanted to pay tribute not only to the glories of the past, but to the promise of the future. I believe that the actions we take and the choices we make, will create the kind of future that we and our children and their children, will live in. 
 A large banner hangs above his head, saying the words 'Protect The Future'. 
 Collier: Thankyou. 
 The audience applauds. 
 Two teenagers [possibly early twenties] are taking food from the table, when they're grabbed by security guards. 
 Liv: Hey! Come on! Get your hands off of me! You want to break it? Stop it! 
 Shawn walks over. 
 Shawn: Hey! What's the deal? 
 Guard: These people don't belong here. 
 Liv: No, you're the one's who don't belong here! This used to be our home before you scumbags decided to make everything beautiful and kicked us out! 
 Shawn: It's ok, you can let them go. 
 Guard: They were stealing food. 
 Shawn: Well last time I checked, the food was free. Don't make me pull rank. Come on. 
 Guard: Yes sir, Mr Farrell. 
 Shawn: Thankyou. 
 The guard walks away. 
 Liv: Big shot, huh? I'm impressed. 
 Shawn: I'm really sorry that we trashed your home. I am. 
 Male: You should be. It's a hell of a lot warmer here than crashing near the Arnheim [sp] Bridge. 
 Liv: So this stuff's free, right? 
 Shawn: Yes, absolutely. Please be my guests. 
 Liv: Yeah, we will. Protect the future huh? Gotta have one first. 
 Shawn walks away. 
 Diana and Tom make their way to the car park to head off to Fairview, to meet with Heather. 
 Diana: Even on the map, the area seems far away. 
 Tom: It's four hours, tops. 
 Diana: This is my first time spending the night away from Maia. 
 Tom: Isn't your sister with her? The one with all the tattoo's? Sorry. 
 Diana: Those beer kegs Kyle ordered should be showing up right about now. 
 Tom: Have you read these charges? Teacher accused of reckless endangerment. Placing the students health, safety and welfare at risk. Could that be any more vague? 
 Diana: Well that could be anything from grabbing them on the arms to touching them on the privates, or maybe she did nothing. 
 Tom: Nothing would be my vote. A 4400 serial killer is bad enough. A 4400 child molester? 
 Angry parents arrive at the school. 
 Venner: Damn right we don't want her back! Not now, not ever! 
 Herman: Look! I don't know what's gonna happen with Miss Tobey! 
 Male: She's out on bail, right? 
 Herman: That's right and her bond was paid by parents from this school. 
 Venner: If they're not worried about their kids then we'll worry for them. Ask Saller [SP], he'll tell them. His kid was abused. Same as Melinda and Kay. 
 Tom and Diana enter. 
 Tom: What about your child, Mr uh... 
 Venner: Venner! Frank Venner. It's not like she didn't try with my boy. Greg just happened to be one of the lucky ones. 
 Diana: Tried what? 
 Venner: Now who the hell are you two? 
 Diana: I'm agent Skouris, this is agent Baldwin. We're with NTAC. 
 Male: Great! You got here just in time. 
 Venner: Yeah, the cops let her go. You can take her to quarantine or stick her back in jail! 
 Crowd: Put her away. Lock her up. 
 Tom: She hasn't been found guilty of anything yet. 
 Venner: She's a 4400 isn't she? She should never have been allowed back in this school in the first place. 
 Tom and Diana walk down the school hallway with Herman. 
 Diana: According to the preliminary exams, none of the kids showed any signs of abuse. 
 Tom: No marks, no bruises? 
 Herman: No physical signs at any rate. 
 Diana: So what are we talking about. Some kind of mental abuse? 
 Herman: Personally, I'm not convinced it's abuse at all, but there's no denying that some of the students have been changed. 
 Tom: Changed? In what way? 
They get to see some of Heathers students demonstrate their individual talents. A boy plays a violin for them. 
 Diana: That was beautiful 
 Violinist: I guess. 
 Tom: You're telling me, two weeks ago you'd never played a violin? 
 Violinist: Never even touched one. 
 Another boy sits in front of them with his paintings on display. 
 Artist: Hey, I only took this class cos art appreciation's supposed to be a guaranteed A. You're supposed to learn about dead painters and stuff. 
 A girl excitedly tells them about her work. 
 Sculptor: It's so cool. I look at a bunch of clay and see the figure I wanna mould. I just carve away the pieces I don't need and there it is. 
 Gregs turn. He sits there sullenly. 
 Greg: You should see the way she stares at you. Like she's drilling a hole. Trying to get in there, rearrange your brain. 
 Back with the violinist. 
 Violinist: One minute she was touching my shoulder. The next thing I remember, she was handing me a violin. 
 The boy with the paintings continues. 
 Artist: Man, I'm standing there wondering, 'What the hell am I doing with a paintbrush in my hand?' 
 The sculptor. 
 Sculptor: And then I see this block of clay and it was like, 'Where have you been all my life?' 
 Artist: My Dad's big dream was to get me a football scholarship. It used to be my dream too, but this painting stuff, I'm really into it now. 
 Violinist: Miss Tobey's the best teacher I've ever had in my life. 
 Greg: My Dad say's, these kids may seem normal now, but in like, two years, they may develop like, brain tumours, go blind, crazy, who knows? You guys should throw her back in jail. 
 Tom has his head in his hands. 
 Diana: Your Dad. He wouldn't be Frank Venner by any chance, would he? 
 Greg: How did you know? 
 Tom: Oh just, wild guess. 
 They later visit Heather at her home and all three sit around the table talking. 
 Heather: Hurt my students? That's so ridiculous. 
 Diana: Well it's not ridiculous to these parents. People get scared when they don't recognise their kids. 
 Heather: But they're still the same kids. I just find what's already inside them and help bring it out. 
 Tom: How do you do that? 
 Heather: I study them. Sometimes there's a light in their eyes, like a tiny flame. And while I'm watching, it get's brighter. That's when I know there's something in them. Something beautiful. 
 Diana: So this light. Have you seen it in anyone else? 
 Heather: It doesn't seem to work with grown-ups. It doesn't work with every kid, either. Like this one boy, Greg Venner? I keep looking but so far.... 
 Diana: I think his Father's pretty adamant that you stop looking. 
 Heather: Frank? I taught Frank. He was one of my first students back in '72. The fact is, I probably taught have the parents that are out to get me. This is crazy! I haven't done anything wrong! I need to get back to my kids. The people who took me....it can't be an accident they gave me t his wonderful gift. That's why they sent me back. To use it. 
 Lily is behind the wheel of the car, waiting for Richard who has gone into a store. A police car pulls up beside her. Two officers get out and walk into the store. Richard looks up worriedly, grabs something from the shelf and walks to the checkout. One of the policemen watches him as he leaves. 
 Officer: Tyler? Richard Tyler. Richard Tyler. 
 Richard looks out at Lily and signals her to drive off, which she does. 
 Richard: Yes, I'm Richard Tyler. 
 Liv and Wayne arrive at their makeshift home under the bridge. 
 Liv: Wayne coughed up a lung for ten hours. What have we got to show for it? Less than twenty bucks. 
 The others are sat eating pizza. 
 Wayne: What have I gotta do? Die to make a living? 
 Liv: Who scored the feast? 
 Male: No-one. It's your friend's treat. 
 Woman: Hey Shawn! Look who showed. 
 Shawn: I was in the mood for pizza. Didn't feel like eating alone, so.... 
 Liv: My very own fairy Godfather. Or are you just some rich boy looking to rent some down and dirty for the night. 
 Shawn: I'm not here for that. 
 Liv: What's the matter, am I not good enough for you? 
 Shawn: Maybe I'm not good enough for you. 
 Liv: I can get behind that. 
 She turns to her friends. 
 Liv: Yo Wayne! Pepperoni! 
 She turns to Shawn. 
 Liv: You gonna stand there and watch or you gonna sit down and eat? 
 Lily phones Brian from her car. 
 Brian: Hello? 
 Lily: Brian, it's me, Lily. 
 Brian: Lily, where are you? You know, NTAC's been calling me all summer, trying to find you. 
 Lily: Brian look, I need your help. Richard, he's been arrested. You're a lawyer. I need you to call the Sheriff's office in Weldon, Idaho. See what you can find out. 
 Brian: Well look, I don't know what I can do for the guy, I'm not a criminal lawyer. 
 Lily: Brian, if you don't wanna help. 
 Brian: I swear to God Lily! You disappear for over a year and then you call me up with stories about the police arresting your boyfriend. 
 Lily: Richard's my husband. We have a child. A six month old girl. How's Heidi? 
 Brian: She's good. Started seventh grade. It's her first semester. 
 Lily: That's wonderful. Brian, I'm sorry to be bothering you with this but I have nowhere else to turn. 
 Brian: Ok, I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can. 
 Tom and Diana go to visit the violinist's father at work. 
 Father: I gotta admit. When Mike first came home with that violin and started playing, his Mom and me, we were both a little spooked. 
 Diana: So why did you help pay Heather's bail. 
 Father: I would have paid the whole thing if I could have afforded it. My wife, uh, she shot a video of Mike playing, sent it over to the conservatory? Next day they called back. Said our son was a prodigy. 
 Tom: Did you tell them he'd been playing for only two weeks? 
 Father: They thought I was putting them on. Talked about how his playing was worthy of scholarship. You know, I thought this kid was going to end up working on the assembly line, like his old man. Now he's got a way out. 
 Tom: Miss Tobey's at NTAC today for a physical. We're asking the parents of the students she's gifted, to come in to be interviewed. 
 Father: No problem, I'll call his Mom. We'll do anything we need to, to get Heather back in that classroom. 
 Tom: Great. 
 Diana: Thanks. 
 Shawn is back at the center telling Collier about his evening. 
 Shawn: You should have seen them chowing down on the pizza. Just getting enough to eat, you know? It's such a struggle. 
 Collier: And you made that struggle a little easier. I'm proud of you, Shawn. 
 Shawn: I'm thinking of going back down there. There's so much they need. Jackets, sleeping bags, maybe a couple of first aid kits? Just basic stuff to survive, you know? 
 Collier: You give them all the supplies they need. 
 Shawn: Alright. 
 Collier: But look, whatever you do Shawn, don't reveal your healing ability. 
 Shawn: Why? Cos they can't pay? 
 Collier: No. Because, if you heal one of them, you'll have to heal them all. 
 The phone rings. 
 Collier: I mean it. Not even you can do that. 
 Shawn leaves and Collier speaks into the phone. 
 Collier: Yeah! I'm listening. When was this? 
 Shawn is in a store with Wayne and Liv. They both begin to play guitars. 
 Liv: Sweet! 
 Shawn: I'm a little rusty. 
 Liv: One of these day's I'm gonna write a concept album. Put my talent on the street. 
 Shawn: Oh. 
 Liv: Gonna win a grammy. Get the bling bling. Get a a private jet. One of those big old gated houses. Enough room for Wayne, Kimmy and Shadow. 
 Shawn: Sounds like a plan. 
 Later, Shawn leaves the store to find her talking with friends. Wayne has bought a coat. 
 Liv: Yeah, matches the dress. 
 Shawn: Hey 
 Liv: First time in months I haven't seen him shivering. 
 Shawn: It's amazing what a warm coat will do. 
 Wayne: Yeah. 
 Liv: Got yourself that guitar, huh? 
 Shawn: No actually, you know what? I got you a guitar. 
 Woman: What's the matter baby girl? You act like you never had a present before. 
 Liv: It's been a while. 
 She picks up the guitar and looks at Wayne before walking away. 
 Liv: You touch this, you die 
 Wayne: Touch it, you die? 
 Shawn: I guess so. 
 Kyle and Danny take a walk through campus. 
 Kyle: I hate lies. I hate waiting, you know? 
 Danny: Trust me, there'll be no waiting tonight. I've been to this club plenty of times. I know the bouncer. He'll let us walk right in. 
 Kyle: I hope you're right. I hate waiting in line. 
 They pass a girl sitting on a bench, reading Collier's book. 
 Danny: Hey, that book you're reading is nothing but lies. Excuse me, I'm talking to you! That trash is gonna rot your mind. 
 Kyle: Danny. 
 Two guys appear. One hands the girl a coffee. 
 Male: What's going on? 
 Danny: She outta be careful. That book's a load of bull. 
 Male: I bought it for her. 
 Danny: Big mistake. 
 Male: I didn't ask your opinion. 
 Kyle: Danny. Come on man. 
 Danny: Just watch my back, ok? Listen pal, let me tell you a little something about cults. 
 He walks forwards towards the men.  
 Kyle experiences another blackout and finds himself standing in his kitchen pouring out a glass of juice. He jumps back in shock. 
 Richard is lying on a bed in a cell. The door is opened. 
 Richard: What's going on? You letting me go? 
 The guard stands to one side and Collier walks in. 
 Collier: Hello Richard. 
 Back under the bridge. Shawn is sat listening to Liv play the guitar. 
 Liv: What's with the filthy grin? 
 Shawn: Just the way that you bite your tongue when you're trying to concentrate. 
 Liv: I've been doing that since I was a kid. 
 Shawn: How long have you been in Seattle? 
 Liv: Two years. Left my Mom and her new boyfriend. Came out here for the music. Somehow my life took a weird turn. 
 Shawn: I've had a few of those myself. 
 Liv: What, you ran away from home too? 
 Shawn: Um, sort of. Except I lucked out and found a place to run to. Otherwise.... 
 Liv: You would have wound up like the rest of us rejects? 
 Shawn: Something like that. 
 Liv: You're one of those 4400 guys huh? Can you make my eyes turn green? What, you able to walk on water? 
 Shawn: I like your eyes the way that they are. And I can hardly swim. 
 He hugs her. 
 Another man walks up. 
 Dewie: Well, what the hell is this? 
 Liv: Dewie. 
 She get's up and goes over to him. 
 Dewie: I see you've been keeping busy. 
 Liv: No baby, it's just some guy. He brought us some food and blankets. 
 Shawn: Look, who is this guy? 
 Liv: Shawn, you gotta go. 
 Dewie: I'd listen to her. 
 Shawn: What are you doing? 
 Dewie: Listen, she does whatever I tell her to do. Do you have a problem with that? 
 Shawn: Yeah, yeah I do. 
 Liv: Shawn please! You've done your good deed. Just go home, ok? Please? 
 Shawn: Come with me. Come with me. 
 Liv: And then what? Are you gonna rescue me? I don't wanna be saved. Get the hell outta here! 
 Dewie begins kissing her neck. 
 Liv: Go, I mean it! Go!! 
 He leaves. 
 
 
 
 Greg is getting ready for school when his father walks in. 
 Venner: Hey! You're not going back to that school. Not till that woman is gone! 
 Greg: But what about my other classes? I've got homework. 
 Venner: Since when do you care about school? 
 Greg: What, you want me to end up like you? 
 Venner: You watch your mouth! 
 Greg: I don't wanna fall behind! 
 Venner: Fall behind?With the grades you've been bringing home? You've been behind since your first report card. 
 Danny is angry at Kyle. 
 Tom: What, you just going to sit there, or are you going to talk to me. Cos I really think you owe me an explanation. You know those guys wanted to kill me and I turn around and my cousin's nowhere in sight. 
 Kyle: I don't know what happened. 
 Danny: Yeah, I know what happened. You ran out on me! It's a good thing that security guard was there. 
 Kyle: The other time I could blame it on the beer. You drink too much, you can black out, alright? But today, I didn't drink anything. I'm blacking out. Losing chunks of time. It's like they did something to my wiring. 
 Danny: They? Kyle, who you talking about? 
 Kyle: Same ones who took Shawn and put me in a coma. They left me messed up inside. 
 Danny: Hey man, you're scaring me. 
 Kyle: How do you think I feel? 
 Brian phones Lily. 
 Lily: Brian, any news? 
 Brian: Yes, I got hold of the Weldon authorities and Richard's been released from custody. 
 Lily: Oh thank God! When? 
 Brian: About an hour ago. 
 Lily: Why hasn't he called me? 
 Richard is sat in an interview room. Collier enters and sits opposite him at the table. 
 Collier: You sure you don't wanna call Lily? Let her know you're alright? 
 Richard: Am I? 
 Collier: You're in no danger from me, Richard. All I want is to make you an offer and if it's not to your liking, then you can walk out of here, you'll never see me again. 
 Richard: How much did you pay those cops to call you instead of NTAC? To get my picture into their hands? 
 Collier: My money, Richard. 
 Richard: Look, you said I was free to go after I heard your offer. You got one for me, make it. 
 Collier: I want you to come home. You and your family. To the 4400 center. 
 Richard: I don't think so. 
 Collier: You said you read my book. Which means you know why we were taken and what we're mean't to do. The future, the future rests in our hands, Richard. You, me, Lily. We are the chosen one's. 
 Richard: Come on Jordan. We both know this has got nothing to do with me or Lily. This is all about Isabelle. 
 Collier: Isabelle. Well that's a lovely name. 
 Richard: For once, why don't you say what you really want? To take her from us. Control us. 
 Collier: Your daughter is the future. I believed that then and I believe that now. 
 Richard: So what's changed? 
 Collier: I have. 
 Richard: I need more than your word. 
 Collier: Of course. Bring me to Isabelle. Let her judge me. 
 Richard: Isabelle's not coming anywhere near you. 
 Collier: What are you afraid of Richard? I'm the one at risk. I'm still suffering the after effects of our last encounter. Richard, it's simple. If I'm lying. If my motives are not pure, Isabelle will punish me accordingly. You'll be free of me once and for all. But if I'm sincere. If Isabelle accepts me, well then I can offer you and Lily and the child a new life. Stop running Richard. 
 Richard meets with Lily. 
 Lily: Forget it. It's not gonna happen. There's no way I'm gonna let Isabelle anywhere near that man. 
 Richard: But think about it. If Collier really has changed, it means we can get off the road. Stop running. 
 Lily: That's a big if. 
 Richard: He offered to act as a middle man between us and NTAC. Say's he can get them to back off. 
 Lily: And you believe him? 
 Richard: He's got lawyers. A whole organisation behind him. We can barely even pay for gas. 
 Lily: He's lied to us before. The man tried to destroy our relationship. 
 Richard: Ok, say he is lying. Maybe all of this is kind sort of trap. 
 Lily: To get his hands on our daughter. 
 Richard: He wants a face to face with Isabelle, I say we give it to him. You've seen what she's capable of. What she can do if she feels threatened. 
 Lily: It still feels like an awfully big risk. 
 Richard: For Collier. 
 Diana and Tom take Heather back to the school. A group of angry parents begin shouting. 
 Crowd: Get out of here! 
 Herman: Welcome back Heather. 
 Heather: I'm sorry about all this. 
 Diana: Once the media loses interest, things will die down. 
 Tom: Until it does, we need to discuss how you intend to handle security. 
 Herman: Let me get Heather situated, then I'll meet you in my office. 
 Venner: Don't get comfortable, cos you're not staying! 
 Later, Greg walks into Heather's classroom. 
 Heather: Greg! Does your Father know that you're here? 
 He pulls out a gun. 
 Greg: It's all your fault. Everything was ok until you showed up. 
 Heather: Greg, please put the gun down. 
 Greg: No. You made me do this! I have no choice! 
 Heather: Yes you do. But only if you put the gun away. 
 Greg: I can't be here anymore. My Dad won't let me. This is my last chance! 
 Heather: Greg, calm down. We.... 
 Greg: No! Not until you change me. Like you did them! You have to. There's nothing to discuss. 
 Greg is losing control. 
 Greg: I'll take anything. Violin, painting, photography, I don't care! 
 Heather: Greg, your problem is with me, not your classmates. Let them go and you and I will deal with this, alone. 
 Greg: Yeah sure. That works for me. 
 Heather: Ok. I'd like you all to leave now. Quietly. Don't run. 
 Girl: Miss Tobey, will you be ok? 
 Greg: Move! 
 The children leave and Heather turns on the intercom while Greg isn't looking. 
 Tom discusses security issues with Herman. 
 Herman: For an entire week? Is that really necessary? 
 Tom: To and from school. Strictly as a precaution. 
 Diana: A continued police presence will send a clear message to anyone who thinks they can.... 
 Heathers voice comes over the intercom. 
 Heather: Ok. So now we're alone. Now do what you promised. Would you put the gun down. 
 Greg: No! 
 Heather: Greg please, put the gun down. It scares me. 
 Diana and Tom are listening. 
 Greg: Well good, it's supposed to scare you. 
 Heather: Greg... 
 Tom hurries outside to find Venner who is still ranting to the press. 
 Venner: DA say's we don't have a criminal case? Fine, we'll take it to civil court. Once way or another, this woman.... 
 Tom grabs him and pulls him away. 
 Tom: Excuse me. 
 Venner: Hey buddy, what's your problem? 
 Tom: You're needed inside. 
 Back in the classroom, Heather places her hands on Greg's shoulders and desperately tries to find something within him. 
 Greg: I don't feel any different. 
 Heather: Greg, I'm trying. 
 Greg: Well try harder! You found it in Mike and Rita, you can find it in me! 
 Venner speaks with Tom in the hallway. 
 Venner: I told you. I told you she was dangerous and none of you would listen. 
 Tom: She's not the one holding the gun. 
 Venner: Greg is a kid. He doesn't know what he's doing. She's got his mind all twisted. 
 Tom grabs him. 
 Tom: I got news for you. I knew everything I needed to know the first time I talked to Greg. You're the one who twisted his mind. You put that gun in his pocket. 
 Venner: That is not true. Now you're the only one who's going to get your son out of this alive. 
 Venner is crying. 
 Back in the classroom. 
 Heather: Whatever talents we're talking about, where there to begin with. I'm only talking about a handful of students. 
 Venner is listening in. 
 Greg: You found it in them, you can find it in me! You have to! Before I wind up like him! Like my Dad! 
 Heather: Is that what you're afraid of? 
 Tom turns to Venner. 
 Tom: And you were worried she was going to damage your son. 
 Greg is distressed. 
 Greg: You know what my Dad's like. He's nothing! He's a big angry nothing and that's exactly what he wants me to be! And I can't let that happen. 
 He points the gun at her head. 
 Greg: Now Godammit, do something! 
 He's crying. 
 Greg: It's no good is it? There's nothing there. 
 Heather: I'm sorry. Greg, not everybody's mean't to be an artist or a musician. You will find a place. 
 Greg: Sure I will. I have a talent for failure, just like him. 
 Heather: You don't have to become like your Father. Somewhere along the line he made a choice. You can make a different one. A better one. 
 Venner speaks to him via the intercom. 
 Venner: She's right Greg. 
 Greg: Dad? 
 Venner: The mistakes I made, are mine. They're not yours. Just because I failed, it doesn't mean that you have to. Please put down the gun, Greg. Don't let my mistakes get you killed. 
 He hands Heather the gun and begins sobbing in her arms. 
 Wayne runs into the 4400 center 
 Wayne: Yo Shawn! You gotta do something man, he's knocking the crap out of her. 
 Shawn: What are you talking about? 
 Wayne: Dewie sold that guitar you got for Liv. Now he's all screwed up, cranked up or whatknot. She needs you! 
 Shawn: Come on. Come on. 
 They drive to the bridge and race over. Shawn finds Dewie lying on the floor with Liv crying over him. 
 Liv: I begged him. I told him he'd taken too much. 
 Wayne: Dewie's dying. 
 Liv:No! No! 
 Shawn kneels by his head and presses on his chest. Everyone looks on as he shouts out whilst healing him. Dewie sits up, whilst Shawn gasps for breath. 
 Wayne: What did you do. 
 Liv: He brought him back. 
 Dewie: What the hell happened? 
 Liv: What happened? This guy just saved your life. Thankyou. 
 Another man walks up to him. 
 Man: My leg. Please fix it. 
 Shawn: I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that. 
 Man: Why not? You helped him 
 Everyone begins to shout out. 
 Crowd: Save us! 
 Shawn: I can't. I can't help everyone, I'm sorry. 
 Crowd: Help me. Have mercy. 
 Shawn: I'm sorry. I can't help everyone. I can't help everyone. 
 The crowd presses in on him and he tries to push his way through. 
 Shawn: I can't help everyone. 
 He runs to his car. 
 Liv: No! We need you! 
 He drives away and pulls up around the corner, obviously shaken by the experience. 
 Collier pulls up beside Richards car. 
 Richard: You sure about this? 
 Collier: Yeah, I'm sure. 
 Lily brings out the baby and walks over to Collier. 
 Collier: Lily. Good to see you. And this is Isabelle. Hi. 
 Isabelle stares at him and he touches her head. Nothing happens and she smiles. 
 Collier: Yes. 
 He kisses her hand. 
 Collier: Yes. 
 Diana and Tom help Heather put her belongings into the boot of her car. 
 Tom: How's that? 
 Heather: Guess that's it. Goodbye Fairview. 
 Tom: At least this time, it's your call. 
 Heather: I'll find another town. Another school. Maybe work as a private tutor for a while. I just have to figure out a way to use this gift of mine without causing so much pain. 
 Diana: Well the world could always use a little more beauty. 
 Heather: I hope so. 
 Tom: Good luck. 
 Heather: Thanks. 
 She get's into her car and drives away. 
 Diana: I was thinking of getting Maia piano lessons. 
 Tom: Oh yeah? Bet she'd like that. 
 Diana: Or maybe even study painting, cos she's always colouring. Unless you could call that a ripple effect. 
 Tom: A positive one.
