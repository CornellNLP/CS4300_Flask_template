 **Previously on The 4400** 
 Flashbacks to the pilot episode. Introductions of the characters and their sudden arrival 
 **Present** 
 Carl, one of the 4400, is working in the fishmongers section of a supermarket. A woman enters 
 Mrs Martino: What looks good today, Carl? 
 Carl: I have a white fish with your name on it, Mrs Martino. 
 Mrs Martino: When you were gone, in 18 months,I haven't got a decent piece of fish. You...you take care of me. You are such a sweetheart. 
 Carl: Oh, it's easy being nice to you. 
 Mrs Martino: Tell me, how does it feel to be back? 
 Carl: It's OK. It's good It's like I never left. 
 Boss: What do you think you're doing out there? 
 Carl: I was helping a customer. 
 Boss: Rosie can help a customer. Derek can help a customer. I told you to stock the display cases. 
 Carl: But I've known Mrs Martino since I was a kid. 
 Boss: And I'm supposed to care? Now, get that flounder on ice. 
 Carl picks up his wife from outside a cinema. 
 Grace: So how'd it go today? 
 Grace: Slow as usual.It's the neighbourhood. It's not like it used to be. 
 Carl: It's not that bad. 
 Grace: It's gotten worse since you were away. 
 Carl: I don't see it. 
 Grace: You don't want to see it. 
 Carl: OK, I admit it. It's not like when we were kids. 
 Grace: No one cares about the place any more.There's no pride.There's no sense of community. 
 Carl: I didn't know you were so unhappy. 
 Grace: I'm not unhappy.I got you back, didn't I? I got nothing to complain about. 
 Carl: Yeah. 
 She smells the fish on him 
 Grace: Oh. 
 Carl: Oh, I'm sorry. Fish smell. 
 Grace: I don't mind. 
 Carl: I'll hop in the shower as soon as we get back. Hey. Let's cut across the park. 
 Grace: The park? Nobody goes into Bradley Park. No. 
 Carl: Yeah? Sure they do. How do you think I got here? 
 Grace: It's not safe. There's nothing but lowlifes and junkies in there. 
 Carl: Grace, I5 years ago I proposed to you in this park. 
 Grace: I5 years ago I was a size 2 and you had your hair down to your shoulders.Things change. From now on, you take the long way around. 
 Carl: Grace, I just wish that you'd... 
 Some boys are playing baseball in the street behind him. They bat the ball and it flies through the air at great speed. He can't see it, but his hand comes out and stops it, anyway. 
 Carl: ... Stop worrying. Marry me, Gracie. 
 Grace: Of course I will. 
 One night Carl takes a short cut through the park. Some youths stop him 
 Youth 1: Yo, what are you doing in our park, man? 
 Carl: Your park? 
 Youth 2: Just give up your wallet. 
 Carl: You're mugging me? 
 Youth I: Now you're catching on. Seven bucks! 
 Carl: It's all I have. 
 They attack him and he fights them easily, knocking both to the ground with great speed 
 Titles 
 Ryland, Tom and Diana are at Homeland Security watching Maia on tape 
 Ryland: The complaints started after her foster parents brought her back to quarantine last week. 
 Diana: What kind of complaints? 
 Ryland: Well, for instance, yesterday, Maia spoke to an employee in the cafeteria. She told her that her daughter would be in the hospital soon, but would be Ok.Then the little girl was in a car accident. 
 Diana: So you're saying what,she's got some kind of second sight? 
 Ryland: I have five stories just like that one. 
 Tom: Why hold a little girl for 60 years and then send her back able to predict the future?What were they thinking? 
 Diana: We don't know if there is a they. 
 Tom: He, she it, take your pick. 
 Ryland: Let's leave that for the team in the theory room. 
 Tom: When they're not playing video games. 
 Diana: That's why they're intimidated.They feel your hostility. 
 Tom: Good. 
 Ryland: I wouldn't worry too much about the big brains.Just talk to that girl. 
 Tom and Diana leave Ryland's office 
 Maia is drawing in an interview room, when Tom and Diana enter. Tom sit's at the table with her, while Diana stands by the window. 
 Tom: Thanks. 
 Maia: I never meant to scare anyone. 
 Tom: We know that, sweetie.But why did you say those things to Mrs Krause about her daughter? 
 Maia: Because they're true. 
 Tom: But how did you know? 
 Maia: I just do. 
 Tom: lf I asked you if it was going to rain next Sunday, would you know the answer? 
 Maia: Maybe.I don't know What's going to happen to me now? 
 Tom: The doctors here are going to take another look at you. Don't worry. lt won't hurt. 
 Maia: I don't believe you. It's gonna hurt, isn't it? 
 Diana: You might be uncomfortable some of the time, but mostly it's going to be boring. 
 Maia: Will you look in on me now and then? 
 Diana: Me? 
 Maia: To see that I'm all right. 
 Diana: Sure. 
 Richard and Lily are looking at an apartment 
 Lily: It's expensive though. 
 Richard: Rental vouchers will cover it. 
 Landlord: So...do you have any questions? 
 Lily: The small bedroom, do you think it'll get too much light for a nursery? 
 Landlord: It's a northern exposure, so you should be all right. 
 She turns to Richard 
 Lily: So, what do you think? 
 Richard: I like it. 
 Lily: Me, too. 
 Landlord: Is this your first baby? 
 Lily: Oh...we're not actually a couple. 
 Landlord: Oh, so it's just you and the baby. 
 Lily: No, it'll be the three of us. 
 Richard looks at her in shock. He's from the I950's and a white woman and a black man living together was virtually unheard of and definitely not accepted. 
 Lily: Why not? You can't stay in that hotel forever. We can share this place. Unless you don't want to. 
 Richard: No. No, I'd like that. 
 Landlord: Great. I'll go do the paperwork. 
 The landlord leaves the apartment. 
 Lily: I hope I didn't embarrass you. 
 Richard: No. It's..It's not that. I figure he wouldn't rent you the place if I was part of the deal.I know, Iknow. lt's not 1951 any more.Times have changed, but... Sometimes I'm just surprised at how much. 
 Lily: Good. It's settled, then? 
 Lily looks around the room, which begins to warp and move 
 Lily: Oh, God. 
 Richard: Lily? Lily, what is it? 
 Lily: Oh. 
 Richard: Lily? 
 Lily: I don't feel so good. 
 Richard: You need to sit down. Shall I call a doctor? 
 Lily: No, no. No, let's just leave. 
 Richard: And go where? 
 Lily: Anywhere but here. 
 Carl arrives home to find Grace waiting for him. 
 Grace: Carl, where have you been? 
 Carl: I got mugged. 
 Grace: Oh, God. Are you all right? Did they hurt you? 
 Carl: I didn't get hurt. They got hurt. 
 Grace: Who did? 
 Carl: I learned something important tonight.I'm a different man. Those aliens, or whoever took me, they did something.They took me. They changed me.They made me better. 
 Grace: First thing in the morning call the counsellor and make an appointment. 
 Carl: I don't have time for that. I've got things to do. 
 Grace: What kind of things? 
 Carl: The park, Gracie! I want to make it like it was before. People will bring their kids again.You and me, we can have our picnics at the old spot. 
 Grace: Carl, you're scaring me. 
 Carl: Wh.. There's nothing to be scared of, not any more. 
 Tom and Linda have been called to the hospital. Linda is at Kyle's bedside holding his hand, when Tom enters the room. 
 Tom: Linda, any idea why Dr Mayhew wants to see us? 
 Linda: He didn't say. 
 Tom: So how have you been? 
 Linda: Good! My lawyer was asking if you'd signed those divorce papers yet. 
 Tom: I thought maybe if we had dinner one night...we could sign them together. 
 Linda: You mean make plans that you cancel at the last minute? 
 Tom: I'll bring the papers, we'll have a good meal, a couple of glasses of wine... 
 Linda: And a good cry. 
 Tom: That, too. 
 Linda: Stefano's? 
 Tom: Yeah. Where else? 
 Dr Mayhew enters the room. 
 Dr Mayhew: Tom, Linda, thanks for coming in. I was reviewing Kyle's EEG read out and noticed something peculiar. 
 Tom: What now? 
 Dr Mayhew: Last Thursday he had a burst of increased brain activity. It was brief, no more than a few seconds. 
 Tom: That's good, isn't it? 
 Dr Mayhew: Technically, yes. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm gonna run some tests, see if I can find out what happened. 
 Linda: Tests!We've had three years of tests. 
 Dr Mayhew: I understand your frustration Linda, but we need to look into this. 
 He leaves the room. 
 Linda: lt's a roller coaster, isn't it? 
 Tom: Never ends. Linda.So Stefano's, right? How does Thursday night sound, 730? 
 Linda: I'll be there. 
 Tom goes outside and speaks to the someone at the nurse's station. 
 Tom: Dorothy. 
 Dorothy: Yeah. 
 Tom: Did anyone visit last Thursday night, besides his mother and me? 
 Dorothy: Let me check. Yes. He had one other visitor. Your nephew Shawn. 
 Tom: Shawn! 
 Tom goes to Shawns school to confront him. He catches up with him outside. 
 Shawn: Yeah, I went and saw Kyle on Thursday night. He's my cousin.I wanted to see him. What about it? 
 Tom: Nothing happened there? 
 Shawn: I was only there for a couple of minutes. 
 Tom: So you saw nothing, did nothing? 
 Shawn: What could I have done? 
 Tom: At your welcome home party, a bird smacked into the window, remember? 
 Shawn: It was stunned. What about it? 
 Tom: No, it was more than that. And then...you picked it up. Suddenly, it was alive and well. What the hell did you do to Kyle? 
 Shawn: Argh! I didn't do anything to him. Look, I really like these little chats we have, Uncle Tommy, but I gotta go to class. 
 Tom: Shawn. We'll talk again. 
 Shawn: Oh, I can't wait. 
 He begins to walk up the steps. Nikki and Danny run to catch up with him. 
 Nikki: A bunch of us are going to see Fountains Of Wayne this weekend. 
 Shawn: Have fun. 
 Nikki: You know, this whole loner thing is so tired. 
 Shawn: Well, it works for me. 
 Shawn walks away and Danny turns to Nikki angrily. 
 Nikki: Fountains of Wayne...Friday night! 
 Danny: What is with you?Why do you keep pushing him? 
 Nikki: Someone has to. I don't see you doing anything. 
 Danny: I 'm giving him his space, let him figure things out for himself. You should try it sometime. 
 Nikki: Ugh! 
 Diana and Tom go to the theory room at Homeland Security. 
 Diana: Marco. 
 Marco: Skouris. Good. I checked out your idea. 
 Tom: What idea? 
 Diana: So am I a genius or am I crazy? 
 Marco: We don't make that distinction in here. Anyway's, I visited a sampling of disappearance sites on the west coast, like you suggested. Turns out you were right. The gravity at those sites is weaker. But only by five parts per billion. 
 Diana: That's barely measurable. 
 Tom: Not to mention barely understandable. English, please. 
 Diana: The gravity changed at some of the places where people disappeared.The question is, was it natural or was it manipulated? 
 Marco: If it was manipulated, the question is, by who? 
 Diana: So back to the possibility of alien abductions? 
 Marco: I wouldn't rule out little green men, but obviously, I'm going to need to take more measurements. 
 Tom: So in other words,you've made no progress. 
 Marco: Er...you explain it to him. Oh, hold on! You remember Adam Kensington? The insurance guy Orson Bailey killed. 
 Tom: Yeah, what about him? 
 Marco: Not one of the good guys as it turns out. He was point man in an insurance scheme to defraud policy holders.Bailey saved Washington state a billion-dollar buy-out. Could have been Enron all over again. 
 Diana: God! That's interesting. Brings up all kinds of possibilities. 
 Marco: Well, er...don't be a stranger. 
 They leave the room. 
 Tom: So this thing about Bailey. You're trying to say, whoever sent him back meant him to go after Kensington? 
 Diana: It's a theory. That's why they call it the theory room. 
 Shawn is sitting on the garage floor playing guitar. Danny walks over to him. 
 Danny: That's tight. 
 Shawn: Oh, no. I suck.Hey, is this about the concert thing? 
 Danny: No, no, it's got nothing to do with that. I just want to know what's going on with you and Nikki. 
 Shawn: Me and Nikki what? 
 Danny: I just want to know what's going on between you two. 
 Shawn: What do you think's going on? 
 Danny: Something. She's always talking about you. Can't go anywhere without her wanting to bring you along. 
 Shawn: How's that my problem, Danny? 
 Danny: Just do me a favour. Leave her alone, ok? 
 Shawn: I thought that's what I'd been doing. Look, you got a problem with your girlfriend, go talk to her about it, ok?. 
 Danny: Yeah. We're the same age. I'm not your little brother now. 
 Shawn: Then stop acting like a two-year-old. You're my brother. She's your girlfriend. It's all good...right? 
 Danny: Yeah, right. 
 Back at Lily and Richard's new apartment. 
 Lily: Richard, I am so glad I found this place. Now we have a new apartment, we can get you a computer. 
 Richard: Forget about the computer. Let's get you to a doctor. 
 Lily: I'm fine. I know this is going to sound strange, but that other place we looked at....the baby didn't like it. 
 Richard: Maternal instincts kicking in already, huh? 
 Lily: No, it's not that. It's that somehow. I know what the baby's thinking. 
 Richard: Lily, the baby's barely two months along.It's not thinking anything. 
 Lily: I can't explain it any more than you can explain where you've been for 50 years, or what's happened to us during the time we've been gone. I don't sound too strange, do I? 
 Richard: Of course not. 
 She reaches up and kisses him. As she turns, she see's a couple. The woman has a baby in her arms and his rocking her. 
 Richard: Lily? 
 Lily: I used to rock Heidi like that when she was a baby. It feels like yesterday, but it wasn't, was it? 
 Richard: No.It was what...11 years ago? 
 Lily: I want to see Heidi. I miss her. 
 Richard: Lily, give it some time. Once Brian's used to you being back, he'll drop the restraining order. 
 Carl is in bed with his wife, who is sleeping. He get's up and goes to the park. Kneeling down by a bench covered in graffiti, he begins to paint it, then moving onto graffiti covered walls. 
 He hears a woman screaming. Some men are attempting to rape her. 
 Man: Don't move! 
 Woman: Stop it! Cut it out! lt isn't funny! 
 Man: Shut up! Just shut up! Grab her legs. 
 Carl arrives. 
 Carl: Hey, guys, why don't you leave her alone? 
 Man: Get lost! 
 Carl: No! You get lost. 
 Man: Go get him, man! Come on! 
 Two of the men rush at him, while a third runs away. The sounds of a fight can be heard offscreen. 
 Diana walks into the examination room, to find Maia curled up on a table, alone. 
 Diana: Hey, Maia. How long have they left you like this? 
 Maia: A while. I think they all went on their coffee break. 
 Diana: Oh! Well! You know, that's pretty dumb of them, isn't it? 
 Maia: Will you stay until they come back? 
 Diana: Of course. When they show up, your doctors and I are going to have a little talk. 
 Maia: And then can l go home? 
 Diana: Home? 
 Maia: With you. I don't like being here alone. 
 Diana: You want to stay with me? 
 Maia: You don't like being alone either. I can always come back for my checkups. Please. 
 Diana: Look, Maia, l'm not even sure I'm the kind of person I want to live with. No, I...eat cold pizza for breakfast and... 
 Maia: That sounds all right to me. 
 Diana: Yeah. You know, Maia, just let me think about it, OK? 
 She returns to her office, where she finds Tom waiting. 
 Tom: Where have you been? 
 Diana: I was looking in on Maia. 
 Tom: Really? 
 Diana: I promised her, didn't I? So what have you got? 
 Tom: Sid lent us his research clippings. I think I found something worth checking out. 
 They go to see the female attempted rape victim, who is working behind the counter of a cafe. 
 Tom: One guy taking on three attackers doesn't sound that far-fetched. : 
 Female Victim: But if you saw him, you'd think it was impossible. He was...35, 40, maybe five-foot-six, weighed 150 pounds. 
 Diana: So not exactly the Rock, huh? 
 Female Victim: lt was the way that he moved. 
 Tom: Could he have been on drug, maybe PCP? 
 Female Victim: He didn't act like he was on drugs. You know, most guys would have walked away. Or, er...maybe called the cops later, after it was too late. But, er...this guy, he saved me. 
 Tom's phone rings. 
 Tom: I'm sorry. [Into phone] Baldwin. Linda. Dinner. Yeah, no... Linda, l'm s... Don't hang up, Linda. Just... 
 Linda has put the phone down. Tom turns back to the woman. 
 Diana: Anything else you can remember? 
 Female Victim: Just one thing. This guy...I don't mean to be rude or anything, but...he smelled funny. Like day-old fish. 
 They walk outside the diner. 
 Diana: So that was your wife on the phone? 
 Tom: I don't wanna talk about it. 
 Diana: Fair enough. 
 Tom: So what, are we in Orson Bailey territory here? 
 Diana: I wouldn't rule it out, which would give us what? A telekinetic insurance salesman, a clairvoyant eight-year-old, and now some kind of sad sack super vigilante. 
 Tom: Hell of a trio. 
 Diana: They're only the ones we know about. Unless you can think of anyone else. 
 Tom: Just take it one case at a time. 
 Lily is hiding outside her husbands home, watching through the window as Heidi does her homework. 
 Brian: Heidi, can you remember the formula for an isosceles triangle? Hey. I'm probably not the best at this, but... 
 As Lily watches her daughter, the baby causes her some distress. 
 Lily: Oh! 
 She knocks over a plant pot and Brian looks up. At some point she is arrested as in the next scene she phones Richard from the police station. 
 Lily: Richard? 
 Richard: Lily. Thank God. Are you all right? I was worried sick. Where are you? 
 Lily: I've been arrested. 
 
 
 
 Later at the fishmongers. 
 Mrs Martino: Carl, I have my grandchildren coming for dinner. How about some nice swordfish? 
 Carl: You can't go wrong with swordfish. 
 Burt: Carl! 
 Carl: Give me a second, Burt. You got like... 
 Burt: What did I tell you about chatting when work has to be done? 
 He's poking him in the chest. 
 Carl: Please stop with the finger. 
 Burt: Stop? 
 Carl grabs his hand and bends it. 
 Carl: I asked you not to do that. 
 Burt: Let go! 
 Carl: I mean it. I show up on time. l do my work. Now just leave me alone. Ok? 
 Burt: OK, OK. 
 He turns to the woman. 
 Carl: So...how much swordfish are we talking here? 
 Tom and Ryland are out having a coffee. 
 Ryland: I'm telling you Tom, there's a lot of chatter in DC about putting the 4400 back in quarantine. Not that I agree. I mean, if they're so dangerous, how is cramming them into one space going to be safer? 
 He can see that Tom isn't listening. 
 Ryland: ...so l took my pistol and I shot her in the forehead. 
 Tom: Shot who? 
 Ryland: Do us a favour, Tom, sign the divorce papers. 
 Tom: Do me a favour, Dennis, stay out of it. 
 Ryland: I spoke to her. 
 Tom: What are you doing talking to Linda? 
 Ryland: I danced with her at your wedding, now I'm not supposed to talk to her? 
 Tom: I was in the middle of an investigation. 
 Ryland: Tom. You asked her for dinner and you stood her up. 
 Tom: It slipped my mind. 
 Ryland: Maybe.Maybe you just don't want to admit the truth to yourself. 
 Richard approaches Brian as he leaves his house. 
 Richard: Brian Moore? 
 Brian: Yeah. 
 Richard: I'm Richard Tyler, a friend of Lily's. 
 Brian: You another one of those 4400? 
 Richard: Is that a problem? 
 Brian: Look, Itold her to stay away, but she wouldn't listen. 
 Richard: I understand you're upset, but Lily's in jail. You don't want that. 
 Brian: What l want is a normal life for my daughter, for my family. 
 Richard: It won't happen again. 
 Brian: I'm supposed to take your word for it? 
 Richard: I promise, if you drop the charges, she'll never bother you or Heidi ever again. You used to love her once, remember? 
 Brian: Yeah, I remember. 
 Grace and Carl are arguing in their living room. 
 Grace: I want you to stop! 
 Carl: I can't! 
 Grace: What do you mean, can't? What you're doing is dangerous, not to mention illegal. You can't just go around beating people up. 
 Carl: I've been given an opportunity and l'm going to take it. I'll clean up that park and then I'll clean up the neighbourhood. 
 Grace: Oh, God, you sound like a crazy man. You promised me you'd call your counsellor. 
 Carl: I never said that. You said it. 
 Grace: Tomorrow, I'm going to call him. 
 Brian: You'd call Homeland Security on me? 
 Grace: The way you're acting, can you blame me? 
 Carl: What I'm doing here, I'm doing for us, Grace. This is where we live. I just want us to be happy and not be afraid any more, and it starts with Bradley Park! I don't want it to end there. It won't. I won't let it. They can't hurt me. No one can. 
 Grace: You're just one man. I lost you once and I don't want to lose you again. 
 Carl: I can do it. I can make this neighbourhood safe again. For you, for Mrs Martino...even Burt. So please stop worrying. 
This is what I was meant to do. This is my destiny. 
 Lily is released and finds Richard waiting for her outside. They hug and later dance to 'Mona Lisa' that's playing in the background. 
 Richard: This was brand new when l disappeared. And it's a... What do you call it? 
 Lily: Golden oldie. 
 Richard: I guess I'm a golden oldie, too. 
 Lily: No, not to me. 
 Richard: Hey, we have to talk about what happened last night. 
 Lily: No, there's nothing to talk about. Do you know what I saw when I looked through Brian's window? A happy family. I realised Heidi doesn't need me. 
 Richard: Maybe one day... 
 Lily: I'll be there for her if she does. But until then I'll stay away. This is where I want to be now, here with you. Where I'm happy. And the baby's happy. 
 Richard: Well, that makes three happy people. 
 Lily: All you've done for me....it's not because I remind you of the other Lily, is it? 
 Richard: Maybe at first. Now all I see is you. 
 They kiss. 
 Shawn is working on his car in the garage, when Nikki enters. 
 Shawn: Danny's inside. 
 Nikki: I'm not here to see Danny. 
 She turns off the engine. 
 Shawn: Cute. Can you turn it back on, please? 
 Nikki: Did Danny say something to you? Is that why you're acting like his? Our friendship has nothing to do with him. 
 Shawn: Nikki, we don't have a friendship, OK? 
 Nikki: Shawn, listen to me... 
 She touches the hot engine. 
 Nikki: Ah! Ah! Ah! 
 Shawn: Hey, hey, come here. Let me see it. Let me see. 
 He rubs her hand and the burn disappears. 
 Nikki: It's gone. It doesn't hurt any more. 
 Shawn: It mustn't been that bad of a burn. 
 Nikki: Yes, it was. You did something to it, didn't you? 
 They kiss. 
 Tom signs the divorce petition whilst at work. Diana walks in. 
 Diana: Tom. See, the thing about vigilantes is that they're not very common, except in Charles Bronson movies, so l have to create my own profile. Now, we know he's a white male,slender, somewhere between 30 and 50. He works a blue-collar job, has low self-esteem, lives in a high-crime area. 
 Tom: I'm with you so far. 
 Diana: I cross-checked my profile with the members of the 4400 in and around the Seattle area and I came up with 37 names. 
 Tom: You're not taking me through all 37. 
 Diana: Of those 37, I was able to eliminate 24. I 'm sure you don't care how. And that left me with 13. 
 Tom: l'm on the edge of my seat. 
 Diana: Here are my two favourites - Robert Lorenzano and Carl Morrissey. They both fit the profile, but Carl, he's our guy. Check out his occupation. 
 Tom: Supermarket employee. 
 Diana: Yeah, I called the store. Carl works in the seafood section. 
 Tom: And our guy smelled like day-old fish. 
 Diana: Oh, yeah. l'm good. 
 It's night and Carl is walking through the park when he spots a man spraying graffiti. 
 Carl: Hey! What the hell are you doing? I just cleaned that! 
 The man throws the can of paint and attacks him. Carl easily fells him to the ground. He turns to some others. 
 Carl: Come on! 
 Meanwhile, Tom and Diana go to his home. 
 Tom: We'd like to talk to your husband. 
 Grace: Why? 
 Tom: Any idea where he was Tuesday night? 
 Grace: He was here. 
 Tom: You sure about that? 
 Grace: I just told you. 
 Diana: Have you heard of the 'Bradley Park vigilante'? 
 Grace: What does that have to do with Carl? 
 Tom: You tell us, Mrs Morrissey. 
 Grace: You're not going to throw him back into quarantine, are you? 
 Tom: We want to help him. 
 Grace: That's funny. That's all Carl wants to do is help. People grumble but nobody does anything, nobody tries to make anything better, except Carl. 
 Tom: Where is he, Mrs Morrissey? 
 She takes them to the park, where they find him sat on a bench with a large bleeding wound in his abdomen. 
 Grace: Carl. 
 Carl: Grace. I got rid of all the graffiti. 
 Grace: Oh, my God, Carl. 
 Carl: You should have seen it. They were falling like bowling pins. I didn't see the knife. I don't know why l didn't see the knife. 
 Tom get's on the phone. 
 Tom: This is Agent Baldwin... Get an ambulance to Bradley Park right away. 
 Carl: I thought I could clean the whole neighbourhood up myself.I thought that's why they sent me back, but I guess I was wrong. 
 Grace: No, no, no, no! No, don't leave me, Carl. Please. 
 He's dying. 
 Grace: No! No! I just want you. I just...want you. 
 Carl is dead. 
 Grace: No. 
 The next morning, Tom and Diana sit by a statue in the park. 
 Tom: Why take this guy, give him extra juice to think he can make a difference, send him back... 
 Diana: Only to get himself killed. What's the point? 
 Tom: I wish to hell l knew. 
 New's Reporter: The wife of slain Bradley Park vigilante, Carl Morrissey, revealed that her husband was one of the controversial 4400. Mrs Morrissey stated that her husband was a true neighbourhood hero, a sentiment echoed by many area residents. Law enforcement officials and a spokesperson for the National Threat Assessment Command refused to confirm or deny Mrs Morrissey's statement.
