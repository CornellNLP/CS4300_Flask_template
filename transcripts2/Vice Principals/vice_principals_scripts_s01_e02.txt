 Bitch needed a coffee. 
 We need to be coordinated on all fronts.

 All right! I f*ckin' heard you!

 Personal data, government documents, financial papers.

 I processed the information. Now destroy it. 
 Bullshit. 
 I have a photographic memory. 
 I've retained the pertinent informations and discarded the rest. 
 Well, did you memorize the part about her firing every other vice principal she's ever worked with? 
 W... where did it say that? 
 Page one! 
 Dumb-ass. 
 At the last three schools she's taken over, she cleared out the front office and replaced them.

 (SIGHS) What do we do? 
 It means we gotta play nice. 
 Means we can't be f*cking idiots. 
 Now, this woman will fire you and me and anybody else she doesn't like. 
 And don't make it easy on her. Keep your head down. 
 Start playing the f*cking game. 
 Then what? 
 "Then what" what? 
 Then who seizes power, you or me? 
 When we shit-can this bitch, it's every m*therf*cker for himself. 
 This is a temporary alliance. 
 To be honest, Gamby, I still think you're a f*cking dipshit. 
 Well, I think you're a f*cking dipshit too. 
 You're a f*cking dummy. 
 I think your tie sucks. 
 I think you're stupid and your face is ridiculous to me. 
 Bushy-ass mustache wearing m*therf*cker.

 The point is... 
 I can't destroy her all alone. 
 Psh. You're goddamn right you can't. 
 I agree to your terms. 
 We take the bitch down, then best man wins. 
 But until then, this is an equal partnership. You hear me? 
 I call the shots too. Not just you.

 You're kidding me! 
 Nope. You're up and running. 
 All right! You're the master! 
 Mrs. Libby? 
 Yes? 
 I'm still waiting on those attendance reports. 
 Oh! I... I have them right here, ma'am. 
 You know what, let me do this. 
 Do you need any help? Are you okay? 
 No, I'm fine. Thank you.

 I didn't ask you to destroy a forest, did I? 
 We're a paperless school now, Mrs. Libby. 
 Oh. Well, yes, Ms. Brown. 
 It's Dr. Brown. 
 Dr. Brown. 
 Mr. Gamby, do you have a moment? 
 There's someone I'd like you to meet. 
 Mrs. Libby : Thank you. 
 (IMITATES DR. BROWN) Dr. Brown. 
 Dr. Brown. 
 Mr. Gamby, this is Blythe Sason. 
 He's an associate of mine. 
 I've asked him to do an evaluation of the school. 
 An evaluation? 
 I just like to know how a school works, who's doing what. It's not that serious. 
 Okay. Uh, sure. 
 Is that all? 
 No, it's not. 
 Since you get here so early in the morning, do you mind picking up biscuits for the faculty and staff? 
 I just think it would be a nice gesture to have a warm breakfast waiting for them when they come in. 
 Does that sound good to you, Mr. Gamby? 
 I mean, yeah, it sounds good. Sounds great. 
 Biscuits are a delicious thing to have in the morning, but I don't understand why I'm the one who has to go get biscuits for everybody. 
 Well, if you know they're delicious, then you do understand why you need to pick them up. 
 What are you writing down? 
 Don't worry about him. 
 So, can I count on you, Mr. Gamby? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 You can count on me. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 You can put that in your little... whatever you're writing down. 
 I'll be seeing you around, Mr. Gamby. 
 I'll be seeing you too, "Sis-son." 
 "Say-saw." 
 That's what I said. "Sis-on." 
 "Say-saw." 
 Say "Say-saw" right. 
 Andy : Mr. Gamby. 
 Oh, stable-master Andy. 
 How are you? 
 Hey, uh, where are we on that thing we talked about last week? 
 I'm... I'm not sure I remember what... what... 
 What was it, something to do with horses? 
 It was about you falling behind a little on your stabling fees for Shadowfax. 
 About $800 behind. 
 Oh... 
 Well, what are you suggesting? 
 Well, I guess I'm suggesting you pay me $800. 
 Or find a new place to keep your daughter's horse. 
 Cool, cool. 
 Okay, that... that's definitely good to know. 
 I'll, uh... I'm gonna get on that. Uh... but I do have a little bit of time to get... to get the money to you? 
 Well, I did already give you more time. 
 I was holding off 'cause you said you were going to get that promotion.

 Did you ever get the promotion? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Gamby : I know that driving doesn't come natural for women, but I am impressed at your abilities. 
 Now put on your signal. 
 Let's pull to this parking lot here. 
 Reduce your speed. That's great. 
 Let's make a slight little wiggle to the left here. 
 Come into a stop. 
 And put it into park. 
 What are we doing at Bojangles'? 
 You are going inside and getting 12 country ham biscuits, 12 Cajun chicken fillet biscuits, and, uh, one... uh, actually, make it three steak biscuits. 
 Can I at least get myself a strawberry Welch's? 
 No, you may not. 
 This is for faculty and staff only. Go.

 The way you said that, it kind of sounded like you got the faculty the biscuits. 
 Well, you got them on my behalf, so I did get them the biscuits. 
 Well, no. Technically, you didn't get 'em. 
 I got... Whatever. It doesn't... 
 You're the boss, so... 
 Gamby, what do you think of Mrs. Libby? 
 I think she does a good job. 
 She's very friendly to people, has a kind voice on the phone. 
 It's interesting to hear you say that because Blythe Sason actually said she doesn't do a good job. 
 She comes in about 30 minutes late every day 'cause she's a part of some power-walking group. 
 What the f*ck is that? 
 Well, she just likes to stay trim. 
 I mean, what do you want me to do, talk to her? 
 I mean, I... 
 I prefer you just to fire her. 
 Fire her? 
 For working on that body? 
 Doesn't that seem a little extreme? 
 She's been here since the early '80s. 
 Then we've given her enough time, haven't we? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Do it today. 
 You're lucky to catch me before I got in the ladies room. 
 The line for that is something you don't give up your place for. 
 You just want to have a... a seat, Ms. Libby. 
 Oh. 
 My pleasure, Neal. 
 Right here? 
 Really? You're just gonna sit here? 
 Fine. I don't care. 
 Uh... what's going on, Neal? 
 Are you okay, sweetheart? 
 Uh... let's just say that I've had, uh, better days than today. 
 Yeah.

 Uh, there... there are certain people who believe that you aren't very effective in your job at the front desk. 
 Who decided this? Uh... 
 Was it Brown? 
 It was her, wasn't it? 
 No. 
 It was everyone. 
 You've been at that front desk for years, and yet you still don't even know how to run a simple diagnostic check on your computer, you're terrible at emails, you suck at using computers, and that, quite frankly, is unacceptable here. 
 And so, you just need to get a hold of yourself. 
 T... You're terminated. 
 You do not work here anymore. 
 Well, no! 
 I can't lose my job. 
 I love it here. 
 You will grow to have other things. 
 I'm sure in time that you won't feel as much of a p... person that has nothing. 
 I can't believe this. 
 There's a... a dignified manner in which you can behave right now, and you're choosing not to do that, so please choose to be dignified. 
 A dignified way? 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 I should've known that after 30 plus years of being here... 
 Mr. Neal Gamby! 
 Let me help you straighten up your desk because that would be dignified of me, wouldn't it? 
 Let me help you with that. 
 While we're at it, why don' t you call my husband, you know, Mr. Libby, and tell him he can't retire - (DIAL TONE) because I have been retired and tell him I'm gonna stop by the thrift store on the way home since we can't shop at the mall anymore?

 I'm fired. 
 Open or closed? 
 Closed, Ms. Libby. 
 Russell : Oh, Jesus Christ, the blood bath begins. 
 She's got me off my rocker, Gamby. 
 We gotta act quick. 
 Now, she's tied up in teacher reviews for the next 72 minutes.

Now, I brought Blythe Sason here to observe this school, and I was expecting him to find unpleasant revelations. But after reading the report on the two of you, I was shocked. "Mr. Gamby is no nonsense. Whether you agree with him or not, he tells it like it is. He's a man of his word. He can be trusted." "Mr. Russell is a great leader and a great relationship builder. He is roundly admired by the faculty." After completing his analysis, Mr. Sason concludes that you two are excellent vice principals. With everything I'm going through, it's a comfort to know I can trust the men standing beside me. And I want to thank you for being a bright spot on a rather bleak day. You're welcome, Dr. Brown. You may be new here, but you are family to Neal and I. Thank you, Mr. Russell. And Dr. Brown, if you or your boys need any toiletries or canned goods, I don't mind going to the corner store for you. Thank you. I think we'll manage. Now, would you mind praying with me now? To pray to God? Yes. Let's touch and agree. Touch and agree. Amen. Thank you. Oh, dear heavenly Father, thank you so much for everything you've blessed me with in my life. Lord, this fire is not gonna kill me. It may knock me down, oh, but I'll get back up and I'll be stronger than ever. Thank you for bringing me Neal Gamby and Lee Russell. (GROANS) Oh, help us. Lord, help us do good things together. In Jesus' name... Mm-hmm. we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Would you mind getting me a cup of coffee? It would be my pleasure, Dr. Brown. Thank you so much. Thank you. Wait here.
