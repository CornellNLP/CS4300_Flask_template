 Dude, turn it up! 
 Lee. 
 Lee! 
 What? I'm sleeping. 
 Jackie's working out again. 
 Well, put in the earplugs I got you. 
 I did. They keep falling out. 
 Please, Lee? It's so loud. 
 Can you go over there? 
 I was just having the most incredible dream. 
 I can't believe this. 
 You can't f*cking put in f*cking earplugs. 
 f*ck yes! 
 f*ck yeah! 
 f*ck yeah! 
 (grunts) 
 Hey, Jackie! 
 Uh, fellas? 
 Jackie : What's up, Lee? 
 How's the, uh, the workout going? 
 Ah, it's leg day. 
 Not my favorite thing to do, but still gotta do it, right? 
 Oh, absolutely. You have to do it, right? 
 (chuckles) So hey, uh... 
 What's happening? 
 I... I think maybe we've talked about this, but, um, uh, when... 
 When you boys are out here doing your thing, do you mind keeping the garage doors closed? 
 My wife, she gets all weird about getting eight hours of sleep. 
 Me, I can snore through anything. 
 To tell you the truth, I... 
 I kinda gotta leave it open, man. 
 Keeps the air fresh in here, you know? 
 Oh, I bet it gets real ripe in there, all y'all big boys just sweatin' everywhere. 
 (chuckles) 
 But, uh... well, maybe y'all can take it inside then. 
 Enjoy the air-conditioning. 
 Lee... 
 I think I can do what I want in my own garage, can't I? (chuckles) 
 Well, of course, Jackie. I'm... I'm not saying it's... 
 Okay, if you want to get technical right now, you're trespassing. 
 (laughs) I'm f*cking with you, man. 
 Man, chill. You were scared, you were scared. 
 I was just... I didn't get scared. 
 Yes, you were. 
 Yes. Yes, you were. 
 Come here! No, I wasn't scared. Aah! 
 That's a little bitch. 
 Yeah, boy! 
 We got a live one here tonight, boys! 
 Please, please, guys. 
 (yelling in Korean) 
 I can't breathe! 
 Jackie. Please, Jackie, I can't breathe. 
 Whoa! Damn! 
 I can't breathe! 
 You just tried to touch my dick! 
 No, I didn't! 
 Yes, you did. 
 No. You tried to jerk me off. 
 Why would I try to touch your dick, Jackie? I've got my own dick. 
 I didn't try to touch your... 
 Whatever you say, princess. 
 (Mi-Cha continues yelling) 
 Hey, Chinks! 
 How you doin' over there? 
 (yells) 
 Okay, you've been here too long. 
 (mocking accent) You go now. 
 You go now. Prease, go. 
 Night-night. 
 (music plays louder) 
 Jackie : Yeah, boy! 
 Welcome to hell, Lee! 
 f*ck yeah! 
 (theme music playing) 
 Gamby : Let's keep the line moving, guys. Come on. 
 Get your macaroni and cheeses. 
 Get your cutlery and let's keep the line flowing. 
 Good work. 
 Dayshawn : What's up, Mr. Gamby? 
 What'd you get up to this weekend? 
 Hey, it was nice talking to you, Mr. Gamby. 
 Miss Snodgrass. 
 Oh, hey. 
 You should grab a tray and follow me. 
 We're gonna skip the line. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Yeah. There's gonna be a fire drill. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 We're not supposed to say it's a drill, but it is a drill. 
 I just didn't want you to be scared is all. 
 Oh. Thanks, uh, for looking out for me. 
 Oh, I know you'd do the same for me. 
 Hold the line, everyone. It's a faculty member. 
 Back up, back up. 
 Dayshawn, I think she'd like a warm, hot meal. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, thanks, Dayshawn. Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 You got it. 
 (fire alarm rings) 
 Gamby : Use all doors, all doors. 
 Keep moving. The school is on fire! 
 Slow children burn, smart kids learn! 
 Find your class, find your teacher, get your ass in line! 
 Move, move, move! 
 Gamby : Come on, you guys! 
 Like your life depended on it! 
 Come on, guys! 
 Why'd you bring your book bag? 
 You're not leaving school. Go! 
 Get in line, goddamn it. 
 Zip the lips! Straighten the lines right now! 
 In a real fire, or if a terrorist organization had infiltrated us, we need to be able to identify who's missing, who's possibly burnt, and dead inside the school. 
 All right. 12 minutes, 46 seconds. 
 I know that seems like a long time, but it's actually pretty good for November. 
 You know what? 
 I'm very impressed with the organization, but we should still be... 
 Hold up for a second. Demetrius Todd! 
 Demetrius! Phone down now. 
 If this were an emergency, how do you expect to hear what I'm saying if you're yip-yapping on the phone? 
 My mom's calling. 
 I don't care if it's the queen of England. 
 All right? Put the phone down right now. 
 Don't you snarl at me. I will smash that phone. 
 One week detention for that phone, one week's detention for snarling at me. 
 Fix the face. 
 Fix the face right now. Do you hear me? 
 Marcus Byrd, what's so funny? 
 Buy a belt and pull your pants up. 
 You look like a flippin' circus clown! 
 Yeah. 
 Mr. Gamby, how many students would you say you suspended last year? 
 In school or all the way? 
 51 students. 
 See, you didn't let me guess. I was gonna probably say 45. 
 183 detentions... and four expulsions? 
 These numbers are pretty high. 
 Well, yeah, that might be a little higher than usual. 
 We had a pretty mouthy senior class last year. 
 Do you feel that you get positive results with your method? 
 I mean, do the kids turn it around when they come back from suspension? 
 I mean, the smart ones that have sense do. 
 You know, then there's some that just have darkness in their heart and will never learn. 
 Mr. Gamby, we're gonna try something brand-new. 
 Flip the script, as it were. 
 From now on, zero suspensions, zero detentions, and for damn sure, zero expulsions. 
 (snorts) All right. Well, that's pretty much all the tools that there are to discipline people, so kids are gonna run wild. Sounds like a great idea. 
 We're gonna try a method called restorative justice. 
 Instead of trying to punish bad behavior, we're gonna bring the offenders together, give them a non-judgmental space called The Circle Room. 
 Miss Swift? 
 Yes? 
 Can you look into the price of... 
 (loud thwack) 
 Why don't you look into the pricing for some beanbag chairs, Okay. 
 A boom box, and... 
 Ooh! A popcorn machine! 
 Ooh! 
 Swift : Okay! 
 I can't even tell if you're being serious right now. 
 Beanbags and a popcorn machine? 
 Relax, Mr. Gamby. 
 This is gonna be nice for you, too. 
 You won't have to walk around here yelling at everybody. 
 (chortles) 
 Don't laugh, Swift. It's not funny. 
 She can laugh at whatever she wants to laugh at, Mr. Gamby. 
 Well, her face is disrespectful... 
 Put your eyebrows down and calm down. 
 Thank you. 
 That's what I... 
 (loud snap) 
 Are you threatening her? 
 Nope. This pencil broke. 
 Gamby :  This goddamn woman. 
 How dare her try to make me feel like I gotta be self-conscious about my f*cking record. 
 I was looking at her and I'm thinking, "You know what Lee Russell would do right now? I bet you money Lee Russell would just haul back and just smack the f*ck out of her face." And you know what? 
 I almost did it. 
 Are you serious right now? 
 I couldn't believe it either. 
 Done with her sh1t. 
 You're complaining about Belinda Brown being mean to you. 
 (scoffs) Yeah. I'm just so sick of it. 
 Ow! Russell, what the... 
 You did this, you f*cking piece of sh1t! 
 We had her dead to rights, on the f*cking ropes, and you just... pussied out! 
 We should've taken her out when we had the chance, and now we're worse off than when we started, Gamby. 
 Where's my f*cking cigarette? 
 Well, I think that that's an unfair assessment of the situation. 
 If you ask me, I, you know, it's... it's been mild success. 
 You know, I have... 
 I have a lot of dark sh1t going on in my life right now, Gamby, and I could really use a... 
 And you don't even f*cking care! 
 Yes, I do, Russell. 
 We're partners. 
 No, we're not. 
 We're not partners. f*ck this partnership. 
 I'm gonna get me a new partner. 
 Someone who will actually help me get things done. 
 Someone who's not a f*cking little pussy! 
 A f*cking little pussy? 
 A hairy, mustached pussy! 
 That's what you think I am? 
 I burned her whole goddamn house down. 
 No, you didn't! 
 I set that fire and you ran! 
 You're just a... A fat-ass, narcissistic, selfish f*cking oaf is what you are with a stupid f*cking haircut and ears! 
 Stop! That's enough! 
 Don't touch me! 
 Don't you just sit there and insult me! 
 I'm sick and tired of you always railing on me. 
 You know, there's sh1t about you that I think is disgusting! 
 Oh? 
 Your whiny voice. 
 You're just like a little hysterical bitch all the time! 
 You know what? You got such problems with me? 
 Well, f*ck you. I'm done with you. 
 Oh, it's done. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, it is done! 
 Well, it's done. 
 It wasn't a f*cking question. 
 It was rhetorical. 
 I'm done with you up to here! 
 Right up to here! It's over! 
 f*ck this! 
 It's done! 
 Yeah, because I said it's done! 
 I'm the one who said it was done! 
 I said it was done first. 
 You just repeat everything I say, you little f*cking mockingbird. 
 Oh, okay, I'll say something you haven't said. 
 I hope you die, bitch! 
 You're already dead. You're already f*cking dead. 
 No, I'm not! You're just saying that. 
 I'm the one who's alive 'cause I'm standing here. 
 You're dead 'cause you're walking away. 
 f*ck you! You're dead! 
 I'll see you in f*cking hell someday! 
 Keep walking, sassy-pants! 
 (scoffs) 
 Fine, Russell! Leave! 
 You bitch! 
 You dumb bitch! 
 Russell, do you have your... your walkie on? Come back. 
 Russell, come back, man. 
 Look, we can just... Let's just talk about it real quick. 
 Maybe things got out of hand there for a second.

 Yes, this is Lee Russell, and I would like to report a disturbance. 
 No, not in my house.

 Aaron Jeffries, you better be glad that Travis Knight is still alive. 
 If you would have clipped him in the right part of the temple, you know, that would have been murder one. 
 And you are being tried as an adult. 
 So now, this belongs to me. 
 An infraction like this would definitely make sure you don't get into college. 
 But I don't imagine you're going to college anyway. 
 You're a goddamn idiot just like your brother was. 
 It's the truth. You and your brother are the two dumbest bucktoothed cousin fuckers I've ever met. 
 Understand? 
 Good. 
 Circles is done. 
 Okay, that's not exactly how we're gonna do things here, so let's back it up. 
 Now, why don't you begin the discussion in a polite manner? 
 What, just, like, do it for fake? 
 Talk to them with some respect, like equals. 
 You set the tone here. 
 Now, why don't you ask Aaron what Travis said that made him so upset? 
 Fine. Go. 
 He asked me how his dick tastes. 
 Okay. Uh, why was it important for you to know that information? 
 Because I used to date Megan, and now he dates Megan, So I was like, "How does my dick taste?" 
 I'm just not really sure what we're trying to figure out here. 
 I mean, is this what Circles is supposed to be like? 
 We sit around on beanbags and discuss the flavor of young boys' penises? 
 Belinda : Perhaps. 
 This is the beginning. 
 You guys were being honest. 
 Now, why don't you ask Travis if he's hurt that Aaron is now seeing Megan? 
 Are you hurt because they're boyfriends and girlfriends? 
 (scoffs) sh1t. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 I think it's time for some popcorn. 
 (Russell and Seychelles talking) 
 Russell : You guys do shampoo? 
 Man : Yeah. 
 I would be the perfect Warren Beatty. 
 Oh, you... 
 Yeah, you could! You could do that. 
 Oh, hi, Gamby. 
 Hi, Neil. 
 Didn't see you around much today, Russell. 
 Well, I've been here. 
 Not really sure what you've been doing. 
 We're about to go get haircuts. 
 Haircuts. 
 Yeah. 
 Seychelles knows a barber who's very gifted. 
 He does the whole thing with scissors. 
 Never uses clippers at any time. 
 At any time. 
 Big deal. I have a barber who does the same thing. 
 Huh. You got... You got a nice haircut. 
 Everything all right, Gamby? 
 Everything's great. 
 You didn't wait long, did ya? 
 Well, I'm not really sure what you're talking about. 
 Do whatever you want. 
 It's fine. I don't care. 
 Interesting choice though. 
 Don't you have anything better to do than just stand around just bothering people all the time, like a gnat? 
 Just a... (buzzes) flying around, everywhere. 
 (buzzing) 
 Stop. 
 Get out of here. I have plenty to do. 
 I'm about to achieve my goals, but you have fun with the Fine Arts department over here. 
 Oh, I... I will. 
 Good. I hope you do. 
 Oh, I am. 
 Then do it. I don't care. 
 Oh, I will. 
 Great. Fantastic. Never see you again. 
 Never talk to you ever again in my life. 
 Fine. What is going on right now? 
 Nothin'. 
 He's just being a freak. 
 Come on, Seychelles. 
 You're being a little freak. 
 You are. 
 You are... being a freak. 
 Out of the corner of my eye. You do. 
 A little bit? 
 Perfect. 
 I've slept with almost as much women as he has.

 Saw you guys walk in when I drove by. Thought this might be a good chance for us to chat. 
 About what? 
 Oh, Lee told me you haven't been sleeping so well lately. 
 Yeah, only when you guys go really late. 
 Usually it's not that bad. 
 Well, I guess you're just not used to the noises that men make when they're strengthening their bodies now, are ya? 
 (yelling) 
 Okay, speak English! 
 None of that "bing-ba" bullshit. 
 I don't wanna f*cking hear it. 
 Okay, Jackie, I don't really have time to chat right now. 
 Some neighborly advice. 
 Don't call the cops on me again. 
 I hate cops. 
 Okay, we have to go. 
 Oh, one more thing. 
 You should try smiling more. 
 It'd make your face look a lot better.

 Did you get a new haircut? 
 Yes. I did. 
 With a friend. Who cares? 
 Why don't you concentrate on what you're all f*cked up about and ruining my evening with? God. 
 He's mad that you called the police. 
 I don't know what he's gonna do, Lee. 
 Mi-Cha's upset.

 Jackie, I... I just... I want to clear the air here. 
 I... I didn't mean to piss you off about the whole noise business. 
 It was... it was just a suggestion. 
 And... and I understand that the... 
 The cops came out here or something the other night. 
 Well, Jackie, I... I didn't have anything to do with that. 
 But here's the thing. 
 Christine said that you were being a little aggressive with her at the store today. 
 I know. I'm married to her. 
 I... Trust me, I know she tends to exaggerate. 
 You are a real piece of work with your complaints, you know that? 
 You think I like living next door to you three? 
 Just the other day, I caught your mother-in-law digging through my trash can like a f*cking refugee. 
 Your wife's cooking, the smell of that Dink cuisine that comes into my yard every other night! 
 Okay, okay. 
 That's enough with that talk. 
 Let's leave my wife out of this. 
 Your wife. 
 (chuckles) Wow. 
 That's a laugh.

 Just looking forward to going into school and not punishing kids for a whole entire day. 
 Oh, you can't be coming up in the school with all this negative energy, Gamby. 
 I don't know what you're talking about, negative energy. 
 I don't have any negative energy. 
 Okay, you know a trick I used to use when I was feeling overwhelmed and cranky? 
 I would park in the furthest spot in the lot, and on that long walk back, I would ease my mind and adjust my attitude. 
 Well, that sounds like a really cool technique. 
 I'll remember that next time.

 And Seychelles, a lump on a log. 
 Yeah, it is a f*cked up haircut. 
 Hey, are you all right, Mr. Gamby? 
 I'm fine. 
 I just think it's hilarious how many people in this school aren't fine.

 Let me ask you a question, man, and be honest with me, all right? 
 Yeah, okay. Go for it. 
 Are you f*cking Mr. Russell? 
 Am I what-ing Mr. Russell? 
 I'm not here to judge you about having gay s*x, man. 
 I'm just saying, you make a cute f*cking couple. 
 Plus y'all go off in the woods together all the damn time. 
 First of all, I am not G, Dayshawn. 
 Second of all, I never go off into the goddamn woods. 
 Everyone knows that about me. 
 I saw you take your happy ass off in them woods yesterday. 
 Okay, well, fine. I went into the woods yesterday. 
 I forgot about that. That was the only time I've been. 
 See? 
 And Russell wasn't there. 
 I was out there by myself. 
 Well, no wonder you're sad, man. You're just heartbroken. 
 Mind your own f*cking business, Dayshawn. 
 Get the trash and get out of here right now. 
 Stop accusing me of f*cking men in the woods. 
 Hang in there, Mr. Gamby. 
 You're an idiot, Dayshawn. 
 I'd never f*ck that man.

 Seychelles : What a macho jerk. 
 Why don't you just call the cops? 
 I've already tried! 
 They can't do sh1t. 
 Honestly, I'm thinking about just getting a f*cking gun and shooting him. 
 Go down to ISS, throw a quarter at any one of those degenerates, get them to do it. 
 Whoa, Lee. 
 Well, I'm not for real. 
 Jesus. 
 It just sucks, Martin. I mean, what would you do if your big, muscular neighbor was harassing you? 
 Muscles? Does... does he look like a bodybuilder? 
 Well, not like big, bulging muscles. 
 I mean, don't get me wrong, he's strong. 
 He works out a lot and he looks good in a tank top. 
 Okay, so like big, country muscles. 
 Sort of like an old-school wrestler build? 
 Well, I guess. 
 I mean, I wouldn't call him ripped or anything. 
 He's just beefy. 
 You know, he doesn't have a whole lot of definition. 
 Okay. Seems like he's got farm strength. 
 What's going on in his tricep area? 
 See any raised triceps in the upper arm area? 
 Jesus, Martin. 
 Enough with the f*cking muscles. 
 You're getting hung up on the wrong details. 
 Well, you're one who brought up muscle in the first place! 
 Now don't be turning this back around on me. Stop being a c**t. 
 Excuse me?

 There is nothing that disgusts me more than a female who cheats. 
 It can be on a husband or on a math test. 
 It's all equally disgusting to me. 
 I want each of you to tell me where you think you're gonna be in five years and how cheating on this math test is gonna help you get there.

 Thank you, Beth. 
 I was just working on a project with a business associate of mine. 
 And I thought we were working on some pretty important stuff. 
 Then he pussied out and bailed on me. 
 Now I'm left to do the project all by myself. 
 And it's hard. 
 It's hard to do it alone. 
 I just keep getting beat down and now the whole entire school is crumbling. 
 Why did your associate leave? 
 Well, he said that I was messing up the business partnership because I was being selfish and I didn't have his back. 
 Well, did you? 
 I mean, to be honest, yes, I did have certain questions about his tactics and ideas, but, I mean, come on, were both professionals. 
 I mean, we're obviously going to have different approaches to things. 
 Maybe you should just try to talk to him. 
 Explain how you feel. 
 I'd like to, but... this man in question is very mean-spirited. 
 But you'll never know unless you try. 
 Did you just make that up? 
 Tracy : I guess. 
 It just kind of came to me. 
 It's pretty good.

 I'm in my rights! 
 (groans, coughs) 
 Gamby : Hey! Hey! That's enough right there! 
 Step away from Mr. Russell. 
 Leave him alone right now. 
 Gamby? 
 Who the f*ck are you? His boyfriend? 
 No, his regular friend. 
 If you keep kicking him, then you and I are gonna have to talk it out. 
 (groans) 
 What are you gonna talk to me about, m*therf*cker? 
 My feelings. 
 Russell. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Gamby. (grunts) 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. 
 I owe you an apology. 
 Maybe I haven't been the best business partner. 
 Business partner? 
 You know, partner in the partnership. 
 You know what I'm trying to say. 
 I'm willing to try harder. 
 It's just been a really long time since I've been in a partnership of any nature with anybody, and I've forgotten how to do it. 
 I... I don't want to take Belinda Brown down by myself. 
 I don't even think I could. 
 To be honest, Gamby. 
 I had all my own sh1t going on over here, and it's just been f*cking me all up. 
 I lashed out at you, and I'm sorry. 
 What about Seychelles? 
 Oh, please. 
 f*ck that f*cking fruitcake. 
 f*ck that whole Fine Arts department. 
 f*ck the Fine Arts department. 
 (chuckles) 
 Partnership back on? 
 Re-engaged. 
 Hey, man, those brass knuckles were the real deal. 
 Did you confiscate them? 
 Yep. 
 Aaron Jeffries, sophomore. 
 Can I see 'em? 
 (door opens) 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, my God. Lee! 
 What is going on? 
 What do you think's going on? 
 I f*cking handled sh1t. 
 Did you do this? 
 Yes, baby, I did. 
 (Mi-Cha speaking in Korean) 
 (speaks Korean) Yeah. 
 Mi-Cha, watch this. 
 Ooh. 
 Sleep, m*therf*cker! 
 (brass knuckles clatter) 
 Whew!
