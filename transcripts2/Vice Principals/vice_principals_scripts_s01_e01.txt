 (U.S. national anthem playing) 
 And so it goes, gentlemen. 
 For the final time... 
 Old Glory rises by these hands. 
 Suffice to say, it has been an honor. 
 Yeah. 
 Gamby : It's gonna be okay, sir. 
 I... I just know that Maria's gonna pull through. 
 I'm just so sorry to leave both of you in this situation... principal-less just as the school year is picking up steam. 
 But Maria needs me now. 
 Russell : Uh, Principal Welles? 
 I... I don't want to make light of the situation, but for my own knowledge, sir, and if you don't feel comfortable saying, please feel free to decline, but do you know who will be replacing you? 
 Oh, here come the buzzards. Why don't you just let the man grieve for his dying wife, huh? 
 Give him that. 
 Superintendent Haas has yet to make a decision. 
 Quite frankly, I could give a damn whoever it is. 
 Just remember one thing, it's all about the students. 
 It's not about you two. 
 That's very wise. 
 I get it. I mean, it might take a little while for it to sink in with this one here, but I hear you loud and clear. 
 It's a Gamby promise. 
 Go to hell, Gamby. 
 Make me go to hell, Lee. 
 Enough. 
 Enough. 
 You enough. 
 Oh, f*ck off. 
 No, I will not. 
 f*ck off! 
 You f*ck yourself off. If you like it so much, you... 
 You f*ck, f*ck you. 
 Just say the goddamn pledge! 
 Fuck-head. 
 sh1t fucker. 
 All : I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
 Aah! 
 I'm going to turn around now, knuckleheads. 
 That was a good pledge, sir. 
 It was a very good pledge, sir. 
 (theme music playing) 
 (cheering) 
 (grunts) 
 (cheering continues) 
 Yeah! 
 Man on PA : Attention, attention, Mr. Gamby. 
 Please report to the main lobby. 
 Attention, attention, Mr. Gamby. 
 Please report to the main lobby. 
 Stop it! 
 Move! Move, move, move, move, move, move! 
 Move! 
 Students : Ooh! 
 Okay, that was not smart. 
 Get to my office. Get out of the f*ckin' hall. 
 Down there, get up! 
 Go! 
 What are y'all watching, a cage match? 
 Get back to class, you savages! 
 (drumming on desk continues) 
 Principal Welles' last day at school, and this is the day you all decide to throw down. 
 It's not very respectful, if you ask me. 
 Makes me sick just looking at all three of you. 
 Sick to my stomach. 
 You see that paddle over there? 
 That paddle used to belong to my father when he was a principal. 
 You wanna throw punches in the hallway? 
 I will pull that paddle down and it will swing. 
 We were just kidding around. Josh, shut it. 
 Matthew, what happened? 
 Ms. Snodgrass : Oh, I can help. 
 He was being bullied. 
 He didn't throw a single punch. 
 Ms. Snodgrass, I know that it's probably a very dramatic thing for a beautiful woman like yourself to witness such barbarianism, but please allow me to conduct the investigation, okay? 
 Matthew, go head. 
 Josh is right. 
 We were just playing around and got carried away. 
 All right, stonewall me, man. 
 I can't help you if you don't let me. 
 Neal! Ga... Ga... Mr. Gamby, excuse me, but obviously these two are pressuring Matthew into not saying anything. 
 And take it from me, he's a good student. 
 Yeah, I understand. 
 Uh, I deal with them on a regular basis, all right? 
 Now, I get it. You're a new teacher. 
 You're full of ideals. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. 
 But you're a little out of your jurisdiction, okay? 
 We got a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to violence in this school. 
 Doesn't matter who started it. 
 Everyone gets punished. 
 Corey L., five days out of school suspension. 
 You pop me one more time, you son-of-a-bitch, and I will bounce you right the f*ck out of this school. 
 Get up and get out. 
 You know, I should slap you across your mouth. 
 You punch like a woman. 
 Potter, Josh Props, Five days in-school suspension. 
 Potter, I don't want to see you in here again. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Josh Props, I know I'll see you again, so until next time. 
 (blows kiss) 
 Get out of my face right now. 
 Make me sick. 
 Uh... 
 Mr. Gamby? 
 Guess we took care of that, huh? 
 I can't believe you're gonna put something like that on Matthew's record. 
 Rules are rules. 
 Yeah, but if a rule is unfair, then maybe it shouldn't be enforced. 
 Well, you know, that might be the way some vice principals operate, but that's not the way I do. 
 But I have enjoyed this spirited debate. 
 Oh. 
 That's it? 
 Unless you got anything else you wanna add, I'mma check my email. 
 See ya. 
 Mm.

 What's happening, Dayshawn? 
 What's the chatter amongst the other workers, huh? 
 Who you all pulling for in the principal race? 
 Oh, you know, they, uh, they pulling for you. 
 But, um... 
 "But, um", what? 
 I don't know if you well-liked enough, Mr. Gamby. 
 You know what I mean? 
 I mean, people got to like your ass. 
 Look... Look at Lee Russell over there. 
 He laughing it up with them teachers. 
 Now, how come the teachers never invite you to eat lunch? 
 They do invite me to eat lunch. 
 They invite me all the time. I just, you know, I choose not to eat lunch with them. 
 They're just a bunch of elitist assholes. 
 I mean, I'd much rather spend my time befriending, know, the... the lower class workers. 
 You know, the guys like you and your crew and Harold in maintenance. 
 I mean, those teachers, they can come and go. 
 When you guys call out sick, how do the floors get clean? 
 You know, how... how do these children eat food? 
 When we call in sick, the other guys just pick up the slack, man. 
 It ain't that difficult to move these trays around. 
 No, Dayshawn, look, what you do is very important here, okay? 
 And when I become principal, I'm gonna make sure you finally get the respect you're due. 
 Now, that's what I'm talkin' about. 
 You're gonna get us a raise? 
 No, no, it's not gonna be a raise. 
 I... I'm just gonna make sure that, you know, people don't look down upon you like they do now. 
 I didn't know anybody was looking down on me, but... 
 No, well, not everyone. I mean, I'm not. 
 But you know how students look at you guys, just like, "I would never want to do that job." 
 But I'm gonna change that image for you guys. 
 Yeah, but if you could line up that raise... 
 Not gonna be a raise, Dayshawn. 
 Don't ask again. 
 Well, I'm just saying if you can get me that money, a brother could use it. 
 Jeremiah! 
 Pants up. 
 If you can get me some more of that money... 
 Jeremiah, pants up, grades up! 
 Like I was saying...

 Why, hello, Mr. Gamby. 
 Uh, you remember Donna from the school board. 
 Of course I do. Hello, Donna. 
 It's good to see you. 
 I was just leaving. 
 I'll see you tomorrow, Lee. 
 Call me later if you wanna have drinks. 
 You ambitious little weasel. 
 Sittin' in here kissing the school board's ass. 
 That's pretty f*cking pathetic, don't you think? 
 And I saw your little f*cking sign. 
 What sign? 
 Don't motherfucking play games with me. 
 Listen here, you. Come tomorrow, there's a brand new principal in town, and his name is Neal Gamby. 
 And those who want to be catty little bitches, well, they can kiss their f*cking jobs goodbye. 
 That is a Gamby promise. 
 You're so confident, aren't you, Gamby? 
 Too bad the school board's still undecided. 
 (scoffs) No, they're not. 
 They know exactly who is gonna be the principal. 
 Why is this job so important to you, Gamby? 
 Is it 'cause you got absolutely dick-all else going on in your life? 
 You wish you had my life. 
 A f*cking divorced loser is what you are. 
 Look at you, just rock hard at the thought of all that power. 
 I know you like to think about my dick, but don't. 
 It's private property. 
 Eat sh1t, Gamby! 
 No thank you, but have fun imagining it though.

 Nice work, baby. 
 There you go. Right there. 
 Nice work. 
 Right there. 
 Right there. 
 I know. She's gotta keep the heels down though. 
 Hello, Gale, Ray. 
 You're late. 
 Janelle just had a really good run. You missed it. 
 Actually, I saw it when I was walking up. Worry about yourself. 
 Hey, Janelle! 
 Good job, baby! Good job! 
 Whoo! 
 Keep your heels down, babes. 
 Keep your heels however you want, Janelle. 
 Focus on yourself, not on negative people trying to get in your life, tell you how to do things. 
 (kisses) 
 (kisses) 
 So I got the principal job today. 
 (sarcastically) Cool. 
 (in same tone) Cool. 
 My success enrages you. 
 I actually don't care at all. 
 Oh, you don't care? Sure, you don't care. 
 Course you care. 
 No, you're right, Neal. 
 I'm always thinking about you. 
 You're right. I forgot it's all about you. 
 Well, actually, it's not about me because my mentor's wife was diagnosed with melanoma. 
 So, how silly do you sound now? 
 Oh, sorry to hear about that, Gamby. 
 That's awesome about the principal job. 
 You've been working really hard, man. 
 I knew good things were gonna happen to you. 
 Congrats, buddy. 
 Ray, nobody asked you to chime in. 
 And it's not even official yet, so don't go, like, running your mouth all over town like you always do, being a little gossip, a little hen. 
 I'm just impressed. 
 Must be tough wrangling all them kids. 
 I don't know how you do it, man. 
 Of course you don't understand how I do it. 
 I bet if I told you I just stole a man's wife and family, you'd understand how to do that, huh? 
 Why don't you go sit somewhere else, Neal? 
 Nope.

 Yeah? What high school do you go to? 
 I'm only 13!

 Look. I'm not trying to yell. I just, I know, you've been spending a lot of time with your mom, and that's the kind of example she sets. 
 But you... you can't go around being fast with the boys. 
 That's not how a lady acts. 
 All right, Dad. 
 Got some good news. 
 You're looking at the brand new principal of North Jackson High. 
 No way. So, that means when I get to high school, I can do whatever I want and never get in trouble? 
 Oh, well, that's what you'd think, but no. 
 Because people expect that, I'll have to go in the opposite direction, be merciless to you. 
 All right, Janelle, come on, honey. Let's go. 
 Fazoli's is gonna close. 
 Ray, I'm talking to my daughter, not your daughter 'cause she's never gonna be your daughter. 
 Okay, well, wrap it up, Neal. 
 Not married anymore, so you can't tell me what to do. 
 My dad, a principal. 
 It's pretty awesome. 
 It is pretty awesome. 
 Come here. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too, Daddy.

 Oh, no. It's just gonna happen regular in front of everybody at approximately 2:03 PM today. 
 What you mean? Like a school shooting or something? 
 No, Dayshawn, not like a school shooting. 
 Don't be scaring these children. 
 I'm talking about a non-violent, hearts and mind campaign. 
 Okay. That sounds dope. 
 Oh, yeah, it's definitely gonna be dope.

 Teacher : Logarithmic functions. 
 I know that sounds complicated, but I'm gonna break it down for you, and it's really not all that bad. 
 Okay, so if you have... 
 What the f*ck is going on? It's 2:08 PM. 
 Where is my walkout? 
 I... I know. I tried. 
 (in whiny voice) I tried, I tried. 
 Couldn't talk any of your friends into leaving school? 
 Kids f*cking hate school! 
 Nobody would do it! 
 I tried, I promise. 
 Get your sh1t. You're going back to I.S.S. 
 Our deal, it's done. 
 And I'm gonna find the biggest, nastiest buck I can to come in there and drill you right in your asshole! 
 Damn it! 
 Look. Speak of the devil. 
 Gamby : Are we done here? 
 Well, actually, I'd love to speak with you a moment. 
 Have a seat. 
 Uh, closed, right? 
 Yes, Lee. Thank you. 
 (sighs) 
 Mr. Gamby, it appears that someone has filed a complaint against me with the school board. 
 Hm. That's interesting. 
 Is there anything you'd like to get off your chest, Mr. Gamby? 
 I mean, nothing really comes to the mind. 
 Well, this complaint says, and I quote "She's not very smart, and if she's in charge, this school will suffer in a horrible way. Dr. Brown only cares about herself. She really thinks she's something." 
 (blows) 
 Now, who would write such a thing? 
 I don't know. I'm not sure. 
 Does it say who wrote it? 
 Why, yes, it does. 
 Okay, fine. I'll admit it. 
 I wrote the complaint against you. 
 Mr. Gamby, I've been doing his for some time now. 
 Whenever a new principal shows up at a school, you can guarantee that people feel like they've been passed over, and often times, they resent the new principal. 
 I can live with people resenting me. 
 That's fine. 
 But from now on, you're going to be very cooperative and very pleasant when dealing with me because if you're not cooperative, Mr. Gamby, and if you're not pleasant, I will drag your face all up and down the parking lot of this m*therf*cker. 
 Now, do we understand each other, Mr. Gamby? 
 Yes, Dr. Brown. 
 Wonderful! 
 Now, I would like for you to come in two hours earlier every morning. 
 I want you to jump in on the morning Driver's Ed program. 
 That means I gotta be here at 5:10 AM. 
 Is that a problem, Mr. Gamby? 
 No, it's not a problem. 
 Well, if that's all, you're dismissed. 
 Have a blessed day. 
 You have a... blessed day too. 
 Oh! 
 Thank you. 
 Leave it open. 
 Say who? 
 Open. 
 The door? 
 Leave it. 
 Thank ya. 
 (hisses) m*therf*cker.

 Belinda's got you by the balls. 
 Driver's Ed. Tough break. 
 Yeah, well, at least I'm not bending over and taking it up the ass with a smile like you are. Over. 
 You have no f*cking clue. 
 While you've been throwing your little tantrums, filing your complaints, I've been learning her weaknesses. 
 And when the time's right, I'm gonna stab that bitch in her big, fat back. 
 I thought you loved Dr. Brown. 
 Please. 
 She doesn't deserve to sit behind that desk. 
 That should've been me. 
 And if not me, then maybe you. 
 You need to flip your sh1t around. 
 Me, then you. 
 Whatever, Gamby. 
 Just not her. 
 f*ck her. 
 f*ck her. 
 Now, she's my enemy, and she's your enemy, and my enemy's enemy... 
 Is my friend. 
 Shall we align... friend? 
 Let's take that bitch down.
