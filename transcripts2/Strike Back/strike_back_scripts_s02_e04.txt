 Previously on  Strike Back... 
 A new computer hacker just came to town. 
 Julian Buckley. 
 Scott goes in there as Buckley, unarmed. 
 Have you had any contact with this man? 
 Who may be allied with Latif. 
 Not pretty enough for you? 
 Bratton : I'm telling you everything I know. 
 I just want to know that my family are going to be safe. 
 What happened out there, happened because of us. 
 There is no "us." 
 You're not Julian Buckley. 
 You're a f*cking liar. 
 And f*cking liars all get the same treatment f*ck you! 
 (TAKES DEEP BREATH) 
 (EXPLOSION) 
 Jesus... 
 Stonebridge? 
 I'm going in. 
 No! Fall Back! 
 Repeat! Fall Back! 
 (WHISPERING) It's Connolly. 
 (PHONE BEEPS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 Ah, it was just a bit of fun. 
 We have the charge set to explode away from your body. 
 Not that you knew that, which was the fun part. 
 (COUGHING) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Ugh. 
 Oh. Oh... 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Ow. 
 (PHONE BEEPS) 
 No calls. 
 You didn't even go for your phone? 
 You strapped a f*cking bomb to my chest. 
 Who am I going to call? 
 My Mom...ask her to defuse the f*cking thing? 
 (LAUGHING) 
 You sick f*ck! 
 Scott's alive! 
 Come on. 
 Oh. 
 (COMPUTER BEEPING) 
 Well, you passed. 
 Oh? 
 And now it's time to claim your prize. 
 Just the one, mind... 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Show him. 
 Come on. 
 Oh. 
 Colonel? 
 Look, Kate, one day you're gonna be where I am... 
 And you're gonna have to make these decisions for yourself. 
 I knew Connolly would vet Scott, in the most extreme manner. 
 I told Scott that he was not to flinch in any way. 
 Not to make a play. 
 Not to call for help... 
 Even if he thought, he was going to die. 
 Did you order him to go in? 
 Grant : I gave him an informed choice. 
 He volunteered... 
 Knowing exactly how dangerous Daniel Connolly is. 
 Do you have previous with Connolly? 
 Northern Ireland was my first posting. 
 I'd been there three days when... 
 Connolly broke into the home of a delivery guy. 
 He delivered groceries to the barracks. 
 Connolly tied up the man's family in the front room... 
 And told the guy that if he didn't drive a lorry full of Semtex into the barracks... 
 That he would kill his family in front of him. 
 But, if he did what he was told... 
 Connolly promised to spare the lives of his wife and children. 
 The explosion killed five soldiers, and maimed dozens. 
 I was the first on the scene. 
 And the man's family? 
 Daniel Connolly is not a man to keep his promises.

 ♪ 
 They've moved to the compound. 
 Bank job? 
 You don't need to know. You just need to do your job. 
 Which would be what, exactly? 
 Override the security. 
 Okay. 
 Do I get to see this place beforehand? 
 f*ck. 
 (SIGHS) 
 What about here? 
 Not your concern. 
 Cracking the access code here, that is. 
 You okay with that? 
 Yeah, well... 
 As far as the future-proof and impenetrable encryption data storage unit goes... 
 Looks fine. I'll need to run some checks at my place. 
 What's this? 
 Hugo...the guy before you... 
 The other codes he was working on. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Hey. You can take this shiny stuff. Nothing else. 
 I want you back at the bar in two. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 (MOANING) 
 Grant : (OVER COMMS)  Stonebridge. 
 Do we have a visual on Scott yet? 
 Stonebridge : (ON COMMS)  Affirmative. Is he okay? 
 (MOANING CONTINUES) 
 I think he'll come through. 
 (GROANING) f*ck. 
 Oh! 
 Kate... I've been looking into ATAT, like you asked. 
 Read this. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) 
 (TIRES SCREECHING) 
 Stonebridge : You look like sh1t. 
 Scott : Yeah... 
 They f*cking blew me up, dickhead. 
 (STONEBRIDGE LAUGHS) 
 Scott : Sorry, I look f*cking bad. 
 You know, I've met some sick mother fuckers in my time. 
 Daniel Connolly... 
 Scott : I'm fine, by the way, thanks for asking. 
 Oh, sorry about that mate. 
 How you feeling? You all right? 
 Scott : f*ck you. 
 Stonebridge : I saw what happened back there. 
 Scott : Oh, you saw that, did you? Did you learn anything? 
 You're reckless, Scott. 
 Scott : Excuse me? 
 She's a f*cking terrorist. 
 Yeah, no f*cking sh1t. Don't worry about me, buddy. I'll do my job. 
 Really? You gonna put a bullet in her? 
 Yeah, if I have to... 
 She's the bad guy. You're the one that's banging one of the Home Team. 
 Look, I told you, Kate and I is none of your f*cking business. 
 It f*cking is if it's going to get me killed out there! 
 Sort your sh1t out, Michael. 
 For your sake. For Kate's... 
 Especially for Kerry's. 
 Your wife? Remember her? 
 Grant : You see Scott do this from memory? 
 Murphy : No, he only had eyes on them for seconds. 
 Looks like it relates to the same site. 
 One appears to overlay the other. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 If this is an ATAT facility... 
 There'll be anti-ram barriers, acoustic, infrared sensors... 
 Ballistic-resistant entry points. You name it... 
 Not to mention, more guards than even Connolly could kill. 
 Grant : This looks like some sort of tunnel system, running underneath. 
 Scott said the maps looked much older. 
 So, this structure could have been there for years... 
 Decommissioned, forgotten about... 
 Well, whatever and wherever this is... 
 Connolly's going in by the back door... 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 (COMPUTER BEEPS) 
 Try again. 
 All right. Root, at 10, dot... 
 105... 
 (TYPING) 
 Dot, 0, dot, 57... 
 M-K, D-I-R, dot. 
 (COMPUTER BEEPS) 
 No. That's not right... 
 Ugh. 
 Try again. 
 Scott : All right, uh... 
 Marshall : We have documents dating back to 2003... 
 Now, take a look at this. 
 Officer : Excuse me, sir. 
 No, not right now. 
 Mahmood. Pakistani weapons scientist. 
 We know what length Latif went to capture and interrogate her. 
 Now, it turns out... That up until 2003, she's on ATAT's payroll. 
 Mahmood and Bratton. 
 It's in Baghdad in 2003. 
 Days before Porter got him out of there. 
 Now, what if, right? 
 Bratton and ATAT intended on planting a chemical weapons stock, in Iraq? 
 Giving the Pentagon hawks what they wanted and making a killing when the war started. 
 sh1t. 
 If what you're saying is right, there's been a huge conspiracy, here. 
 And some very influential people will go a long way... 
 To make sure none of this ever comes out. 
 Grant : Where are we? 
 Scott saw the code that Connolly's hacker used. 
 Right. Do we know what it was? 
 No. We have the data, and we have the device. 
 But, we also need the initialization protocol... 
 That they used to hack into ATAT's security system. 
 Grant : Can we use it to hack? 
 Only if we get the exact code. 
 One wrong character and it's completely useless... 
 Oh, come on, having a photographic memory... 
 And trying to remember all this sh1t's really f*cking hard with you people talking. 
 Shut the f*ck up! 
 (SWORD SLASHING) 
 The guy before you, he was working on it. 
 Try this... 
 D-I-R... 
 (TYPING) 
 Slash, root at 10... 
 Dot, 105... 
 Dot, 0, dot, 57. 
 (COMPUTER BEEPING) 
 We're in. 
 Well done. 
 f*ck yeah. Did you see that? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (COMPUTER BEEPING) 
 (DISTORTED CHILDREN LAUGHING) 
 We've implanted a worm on this hard drive. 
 Scott needs to open the system with the drive and the code... 
 The worm will then allow me to remotely bypass the proprietary firewall... 
 And work on the system from here. 
 Right. Only one problem, dude. I don't speak "geek." 
 You just remember the code. 
 Leave the rest to me. 
 But, you will need to buy me some time. 
 Yeah, how much? 
 A few seconds. 
 Shouldn't be a problem for Damien Scott, world-class bull shitter. 
 So that opens the vault? 
 No, hacking into the system will bypass the base site security. 
 Sinclair : And avoid triggering the alarm. 
 (WHISPERS) Right. 
 All right. How do we get in the vault? 
 Hmm. Most likely a biometric key. 
 Retinal scan, fingerprint match... 
 From a high-ranking executive, like... 
 Both : Kenneth Bratton. 
 All right, I'm outta here. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) 
 Hello? 
 Bratton : (OVER PHONE)   It's Ken Bratton. I need to see you. 
 I can't speak over the phone. 
 Bratton : We have to meet. Somewhere safe. 
 Looking forward to that drink together? 
 What drink? 
 Scott : (ON PHONE) 
 She's here. Gotta go. 
 (BLUES MUSIC PLAYS) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Where's everyone else? 
 Busy. 
 Right. 
 What are you worried about? 
 I'm on orders to keep you relaxed. 
 (SIGHS) Mmm. 
 Bratton's scared. He wants to meet in a public place. 
 You think he's telling the truth? 
 I do, yeah. This is about his children. 
 You know, Colonel, if we're right, and bring Bratton in... 
 This puts an end to Connolly's plan. 
 You could pull Scott out. 
 Captain, nothing would give me greater pleasure than chopping Connolly off at the knees. 
 But his plan needs to succeed, if he is to lead us to Latif. 
 Connolly could be coming for Bratton at any time. 
 I want you to extract him quickly and quietly. 
 So, we can brief him... 
 And put him back to work with Connolly, under our protection. 
 I want...you're his contact, you're running point. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Stonebridge : Copy that. Kate... 
 Let me get in close. 
 You run point. 
 He asked for me. 
 No, I... I know he did, but... 
 But, what? 
 Scott told me about Connolly. 
 If something goes wrong, or it's a trap... 
 Michael... 
 I don't need you protecting me. 
 Look, I know... 
 You don't need me protecting you. 
 But, I care about you. 
 I know. 
 Connolly :   Lovely family, Ken. 
 Bratton :   I can't speak over the phone. 
 We have to meet. 
 I just want to know that my family are going to be safe. You wanted to see me, Ken? Darrin, there are certain things I need to tell you. Oh, f*ck me! (CONTINUOUSLY) Please. Please, please, please. Just stop, stop, stop... Oh, f*ck! Oi! Oh, God, oh... Oi. Wow. Scott : That was amazing. You really know what you're doing, huh? I trained for two years. Pleasure and pain. That's me. You know, if you're that good at something... Nobody wants to pay for a massage... Not since the credit crunch. (SCOTT LAUGHS) So, uh, you just become some terrorist groupie? Hmm? You don't know Daniel. You don't see what he stands for, what he believes in... Anyway, live fast, die young... So, what happens if you don't die? Who would you rather see in the mirror in 20 years time? A happy masseuse with a couple of kids... Or just some cold-hearted soulless bitch with black holes for eyes? Hmm? f*ck you. (GRUNTING) Yeah? (BREATHING HEAVILY) So, how many people have you killed? (SIGHS) Where the f*ck are they? (SLAMS ITEMS) Man : Visual? Stonebridge  (over comms):  Principal. Visual clear. Ready to transport. Copy that. Initiating contact. 
 
 (PHONE BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? Marshall : (ON PHONE)  Walk to the end of the street and take a right  at the coffee shop. Marshall : Wait for me at the windows, outside. Marshall : Mr. Bratton! Am I being followed? Relax, we're gonna get you out of here. Bratton : (ON COMMS)  What about my family? Marshall :  They're fine. You need to come with me. Yeah, I have to know. Bratton : (ON COMMS)   I have to know that they're safe. Marshall :  They'll be safe. We're fifty yards from making that happen. You just need to come with me. Bratton :   No! I need to know that they are safe! Marshall :   Kenneth, I need to get you into the car. Bratton :   Christ, how the hell did I get into this? Transport secured? Negative, walking away. (BRATTON AND MARSHALL CONTINUE ARGUING) No! You have no idea the pressure we were under. They wanted...no, God knows they needed to find chemical weapons in Iraq. Marshall : Listen to me. It was never supposed to be used. Get into the car, Kenneth! Kate, bring him back! Bratton : That's why I hid it. Principal is not secure. Repeat, principal is not secure. When I found out what this damn thing could do... Okay... Millions of people with just a few drops... Kate, what are you doing? Talking Sarin? Talking VX? Yes, but you must understand... Then tell me about it... What the hell is going on? (TIRES SCREECHING) (SCREAMING) Move! What the hell is going on? (GRUNTING) (YELLING) (YELLING) Stonebridge : Get down! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) sh1t! (CAR ALARMS RINGING) Leave. We're moving now. It's true what they say. You can take the girl out of Ireland... Connolly's is after a chemical weapon for Latif. Sarin VX. That's what Kate said. Grant : We have to get our hands on it first. Kate? We do not deflect from this mission. All right, we still have Scott on the inside. And we have no way of knowing where Kate is. That's not entirely true, Colonel. Sinclair : Maintaining lock on Scott's phone. Heading East. (COMPUTER BEEPING) Sinclair : Signal is slow. (MOANING) Scott : Are you f*cking serious? Scott : Come on. Oh, very f*cking sneaky. Scott : Nice. Why'd you change the schedule? Are you getting cold feet? (DROPS PHONE) (WHISTLES) (COMPUTER BEEPING) We've lost Scott's phone. I don't remember giving you an order to put a tracking device on Captain Marshall. Give them the tracking reference. And then get out in the field and find Kate. Yes, Ma'am. So, what is this place? Patience... How you holding up, Ken? I have a surprise for you. They've got my family! (GRUNTING) Now, come on Ken. Remember Ramadi? Morgan : Remember the lies I told for you? I put my neck on the block for you. And just because you've lost your balls... Doesn't mean you're going to take me down with you. (MARSHALL GRUNTS) (COMPUTER BEEPS) We've got Marshall's signal. Murphy : It's the same location as Scott. So... As we discussed... Ken's not leaving? Nobody's leaving. (GUNSHOT FIRED) Now, I've got to ask... What's a nice girl like you doing working for the Colonial enemy? Spare me the prehistoric shite. See, I think it's a childhood thing, that you've, uh, never... Well, ya know... Playing soldiers in the back garden with your brother... No...brothers... Always wanting to be one of the lads. Enough about me. Did you always want to be a cold-blooded butcher? No, it wasn't my first calling... Don't tell me... You want to become a priest. No, as a matter of fact... You know, I've never told anyone this before... I always wanted to be a jockey. On the level. When I was 15, I jumped school, and... Hopped on a bus to Fermanagh to work at a stable out there. You know, mucking out, grooming... I even got to ride a couple of times. It was the greatest week of my life. And then on a Saturday... The head lad calls me in and says... "We have to let you go." Why was that? I frightened the horses. (ENGINE ROARING) (COMPUTER BEEPING) Murphy : They're on the move. Murphy : (ON COMMS)  Sending you co-ordinates. (TIRES SCREECHING) So, basically, we're just gambling... That Marshall will be with Connolly. If she's still alive, it's because Connolly has a use for her... (GUNSHOTS FIRED) Murphy : We're getting transmission interference. Her signal's down. I'm patching through last coordinates. Stonebridge : (ON COMMS)  Roger that. On my way. According to Captain Marshall's last known position... I think the tunnel's under this facility. And what is it? It's a factory making fertilizers, agricultural chemicals. A shell company for ATAT? A hiding place. (EXPLOSION) (GRUNTING) (DOOR CREAKING) (GRUNTS) You're on. (DEVICE BEEPING) (SIGHS) Wanna give me a bit of space? Please. D-I-R, breaker, at 10, dot 105... Dot, 0, 550... (COMPUTER BEEPS) Okay. Scott's online. Okay. Here we go. (BEEPS) The worm's not loading. Scott : Uh, all right. Behind the doors. Access. (BEEPS) Voila. What's the problem, Major? I, I don't understand. It... Come on. (COMPUTER BEEPS) f*ck. f*ck! It's not loading. Uh... I don't know what's going on. (COMPUTER BEEPS) Activated! Okay, okay. The worm is uploading. Come on... Sinclair : Come on. Denied? Not denied. Not recognized. Come on. Come on. Work, damn it work! Have we a problem? Come on! The worm! It works! Okay, I-D. Password, please. We're in. (COMPUTER BEEPS) (DOORS UNLOCK) I never doubted you. Watch him. Come on. (SIGHS) It's a bit late to find your spine, Ken. (DEVICE BEEPING) This is nice... (DOOR UNLOCKS) Connolly : Open it. (BREATHES DEEPLY) (TURNING LOCK) Do you have any idea what that is? I haven't got a f*cking clue. Pack it. What're you gonna do? You're gonna kill me? If that's what he tells me to do. (SCOFFS) I'm on his side, remember? He's got no side. All right? It's just him against everyone else! He's killing everyone else. Think about it. Come on. As soon as I'm done here, he's gonna kill me. Shut up! Shut the f*ck up! Bratton : That's it. As soon as you're done, he's gonna kill you. Who are you? Who the f*ck are you? What about my family? You'll never know. (GUNSHOTS FIRED) (ALARMS RINGING) They detected the worm. (ALARMS CONTINUE RINGING) Neve : What the f*ck! (GRUNTING) Scott : f*ck! No! (GUNSHOTS FIRED) (SCREAMING) Scott : No! Scott : f*ck me. Stonebridge : You okay? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's down here. Scott : Grenade! Get down! sh1t! (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) Stonebridge : Come on. Another grenade! Move! (SCREAMING) Connolly, drop your weapon! Scott : Coast clear. Capture, Michael, do not f*cking kill him! Stonebridge : He's up, he's up, come on! Stonebridge : Connolly, stop, don't move! Scott : Put the weapon down, Connolly. Put it down! Put the f*cking weapon down! Put it down! Gently. Now, get on the ground. On the ground. Come on, get on your f*cking knees! Get the f*ck on the ground! Typical f*cking British. Always giving orders. (GRUNTING) Scott : On the ground. I think you should look in the van, lads. Can't have too much insurance, you know what I mean? Keep watching him. Marshall : No, Michael, Michael! sh1t. Kate! Stonebridge : It's all right. (BOMB BEEPING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay. You like that? You f*cking piece of sh1t! Ahhh! Scott : It's your shot to add the f*cking point. Some of my best work. Shut the f*ck up! Shut up! We have an anti-handling device. There's a tilt switch, yeah? Yeah, that's right. That mercury moves, it'll detonate. You have to stay still. These charges are shaped to blow right towards you. Can you feel anything else? Yeah, there's something, um... Uh, Cold... It's metal, digging into my stomach. No, I can still cut through this cable, here. No, it's wired to the bomb. It's all right. I can get this off of you. Michael... Michael... I just have to see... Besides, we both know there isn't any time! (BOMB CONTINUES BEEPING) Switch it off. Switch it f*cking off! Yeah, I can switch it off... But you'll have to let me go. No f*cking way! You've won. You got your f*cking apocalypse back. Now, all I'm saying is, I can disable that timer remotely. That is bullshit! But, I'll need 100 yards start. No, no, Michael! Oh, you think I haven't done this sort of thing before? You f*ck! Yeah, go ahead! Shoot me! Connolly : Go on! He will not f*cking do it! Scott! Scott! We have to give her a chance, man! There is no f*cking chance! And he's playing you! C'mon soldier. What other choice do you have? Or maybe she's not worth it. (YELLS) Michael! Michael! Ah. Michael, he's a f*cking liar. Tick, tock, lads. I can't let her die. Tick, tock. Scott : He's not gonna do it. Michael! 100 yards. Michael! That's all I need. Michael, he won't f*cking do it. Shut up, Scott. Scott : Michael, he's f*cking with you... Michael, no! Scott : You will not get that bomb off her! Stonebridge : Shut up. Promise. sh1t. Scott : f*ck! We've got the weapon. What have you done? It's fine. We got the weapon. What have you done? He promised! He promised. (CRYING) What have you done? He promised. Bitch. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Time to go. Michael, look at me. Do you love me? Sergeant, you will obey this order! I'm sorry, Kate. Michael, get the f*ck out. You always had my back. Come on! Move! Stonebridge : I'm sorry, Kate! Scott : Move! Scott : Come on! (BOMB BEEPS) Kate! Kate! Kate! (GRUNTING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) (PHONE BEEPS ON) Yes? My friend, a thousand apologies. Until now, he had proved very reliable. The reputation of a man like Connolly, relies on results. Let him know I'm extremely disappointed. Of course. But, I assure you this is only a temporary setback. Kwarfet's contact is still in place. And I know where the remaining stock can be found. (PHONE BEEPS OFF) (INDISTINCT YELLING) (FISHERMEN CONTINUE YELLING) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) Fellahs... What took you so long? Didn't seem like you were going anywhere. You're right. I figured between you and Latif... Ah, ugh... Got tired of running. Sorry about your friend... But you know how it is. I had a dream about you, Eleanor. So I did... I'd like it to be you. Soldier to Soldier. You were never a soldier. (GUNSHOT) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)
