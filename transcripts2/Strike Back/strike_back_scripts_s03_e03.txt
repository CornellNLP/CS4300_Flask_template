 Mr. Scott, this kidnapping happened right under your nose. 
 What do we know about the female? 
 This is Rachel Dalton. 
 Sir, she's one of ours. 
 Tonight you'll be employing live rounds. 
 Jake! 
 Probably you're about to be taken. 
 It's Damien. 
 He's in trouble. 
 What's in the case? 
 Nuclear triggers. 
 I won't lose the triggers. 
 Section 20 requires new leadership. 
 Some of you already know Captain Dalton. 
 You're sh1tting me. 
 Can we start again? 
 Of course we can. 
 Kerry. Kerry! 
 They've identified Craig Hanson as the man who murdered your wife. 
 How do you feel about that? 
 When I heard, I wanted to kill him. 
 And now? 
 He's sick. 
 He'll be caught. 
 Anger and rage are legitimate sentiments at this stage, Sergeant. 
 For example, it wouldn't be unusual if right now you wanted revenge. 
 The system will take care of Hanson. 
 You trust the system? 
 I'm a soldier. 
 Dalton : Michael Stonebridge has requested reassignment to this unit. 
 And you approved that? 
 Subject to a psych evaluation, yes. 
 This isn't a rehabilitation ward. 
 You put him back in the field now, you put him and anyone operating with him at risk. 
 So I have to ask, why would you do that? 
 We need the best. 
 If he passes the evaluation, that's good enough for me. 
 Hanson was a soldier, too, Real soldiers don't do bad things. 
 We follow orders. 
 So the killing isn't personal... 
 Sinclair : You bring Stonebridge back, he owes you. 
 And your point is? 
 Isn't that how you intelligence types operate? 
 He owes you, you own him. 
 You are aware that if you admitted a desire for revenge, you would fail this evaluation? 
 I am. 
 You might not like it, Major Sinclair, but as things stand, I command this unit, so let's be clear, shall we? 
 I own you all. 
 Scott, if Stonebridge does come back, you'll be out in the field with him. 
 It's your call. 
 ♪ 
 Psychologist : Sergeant Stonebridge, why do you want to return to Section 20? 
 I lost my wife. 
 I have to deal with that, but I want to put Hanson and everything else behind me... 
 And do what I do best-- soldiering.

 Axmali, Al-Shabaab cleric. 
 New intel confirms that Axmali has the triggers that we missed and has made clear his intentions to sell them to fellow believers. 
 Sinclair : Now he's been located at this compound here in Niger. 
 Yesterday, this man shows up. 
 Julia : The only other non-local there, apart from Axmali. 
 They've been holed up in the compound together for hours. 
 Negotiating for the triggers? 
 Given what's at stake, we have to assume so. 
 We hit now or lose the triggers to someone who might deploy them. 
 Mike, I'm not even gonna pretend to know what you're going through, but... 
 If you ever want to talk, I'm here. 
 Thanks. 
 And of course, if you ever want to go out and just get f*cked up... 
 [Laughs] 
 I'm your guy. 
 As long as you're paying. 
 Yeah, I'll bear that in mind. 
 Scott... 
 I'm ok.

 Zero, this is Bravo One at target. 
 Go. 
 Bravo Two.

 Scott : Zero, we're in.

 [Baby crying] 
 Julia : I thought I should verify. 
 Americans have two F-16s airborne and inbound for the compound. 
 Why? Tell them we already have a team-- 
 They know, but it's too late. 
 Strike imminent. 
 I have them. 
 ETA less than 60 seconds. 
 Aah! 
 Stonebridge : Where are the triggers? 
 In Allah's hands. 
 Julia : Bravo, exfil now, whatever your mission status. 
 Move out. 
 We have incoming F-16s, and they are weapons hot. 
 Stonebridge : Roger that. 
 Let's move. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Stonebridge : Come on. Come on. 
 Bravo, you have less than 30 seconds. 
 Knew that. 
 Faster. 
 We're moving! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 On it. 
 Disregard. 
 They're overhead. 
 Scott : Down, down, down! 
 Aah! 
 Scott : Get down! 
 Aah!

 Scott : Oh, f*ck. 
 f*ck.

 Ugh! 
 Dalton : Bravo, are you all right? 
 Stonebridge : Yes, but Axmali is dead. 
 Dalton : And the package? 
 Stonebridge : That's negative.

 Stonebridge : 2.

 Bravo, I have a possible on the buyer, moving to south side exit. 
 Copy that. 
 Bravo One, we've lost your visual.

 Fall back to the jeep and take that intel. 
 You heard him. 
 Move! 
 Stonebridge : Two, left. Two, left. 
 Scott : One, right. 
 Stonebridge : Aah! 
 Aah! Ugh!

 Who are they? 
 Bravo Two, be advised Bravo One is in trouble. 
 Scott : You guys getting this? f*ck! 
 [Men shouting] 
 Get Baxter and the rest of our men-- 
 No. Bravo, I do not want a firefight. 
 Bravo Two, is that clear? 
 Let him go! 
 Mike. Mike, don't now! 
 Let him go! 
 Dalton : Bravo, I repeat, I do not want a firefight. 
 f*ck. 
 Dalton : Bravo Two, is that clear? 
 Roger. Roger! 
 This was our exclusive source. 
 The American's couldn't possibly have known about Axmali or the triggers. 
 Sinclair : It has nothing to do with our mission. 
 A CIA flight was shot down over Mali 6 hours ago. 
 NSA tracked the call that ordered the attack to the compound. 
 Bombing the compound was simply a reprisal for the loss of their plane. 
 This plane that was carrying those Satan CIA was shot down by my order. 
 I could do this because God directs me. 
 I am his instrument. 
 Sinclair : That's El Soldat. 
 He used to be Algerian special forces, didn't he? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Things are complicated in The Magreb. 
 What the f*ck happened to "no man left behind," huh? 
 I want every piece of intel from that compound analyzed. 
 Sinclair : And what about Scott? 
 I know exactly where he'll be. 
 [Men shouting] 
 f*ck me. 
 [Door opens] 
 Christy Bryant. 
 [Metallic sound] 
 You left Manila without saying good-bye. 
 Yeah. 
 3 years later, I get a call from Mogadishu. 
 Yeah. That unsafe safe house. 
 I got thank you for that one. 
 So who's your new best friend? 
 Niger SF. 
 We train them. 
 What were you doing in that compound, Damien? 
 I was looking for a vacation home. 
 Why were you bombing it? 
 They initiated an attack that killed 5 CIA agents. 
 I was with 20, but you know that. 
 I should see that they're fully briefed on you. 
 Scott : They know. 
 Everything? 
 Didn't think so. 
 [Removes handcuffs] 
 What is it you really want? 
 Just to... reconnect. 
 [Drops handcuffs] 
 No way. 
 I'm not that guy. 
 Not anymore. 
 [Laughs] 
 What's your game, Damien? 
 Run off to play soldier with the Brits, somehow redeem yourself? 
 Like you care. 
 You think... because they say "pardon me" before they cut a guy's throat, they're any different than us? 
 [Unbuckles belt] 
 [Christy moans] 
 Faster. 
 [Scott moans] 
 sh1t. 
 f*ck. 
 I knew I should never have made that call from Mogadishu. 
 Don't beat yourself up. 
 There are certain things you can't leave behind, no matter how hard you try. 
 [Dials telephone] 
 Dalton : Yes? 
 Bryant, CIA. 
 I have something of yours. 
 You should be more careful. 
 You're still on probation. 
 Yeah. 
 You think the police are gonna find him? 
 I think they worked out it was him. 
 He knew the ballistics would tie him to that gun. 
 Mike, well, he's the subject of an international manhunt. 
 He's one of us. 
 They'll never find him. 
 Bryant : Wouldn't you like to be able to go home one day? 
 f*ck you. 
 I could put in a good word. 
 Thanks. 
 You remember home, don't you? 
 "Star-spangled banner"? 
 Bald eagles? 
 Sad songs sung by rednecks in big-ass hats? 
 Shut up. 
 You know I love country music. 
 Don't be a stranger. 
 Yeah. 
 [Door opens] 
 Next time be more careful where you leave your people. 
 There won't be a next time. 
 You f*cking left me hanging out to dry? 
 The CIA usually send in an SF team to assess effectiveness. 
 I knew you'd be in safe hands. 
 I couldn't risk a firefight or them taking our intel. 
 Did you tell her why we were in there? 
 Dalton : Good. 
 You know, she wants me to question your loyalty. 
 I'm all yours, ma'am, whenever you're ready. 
 Wash off the cheap perfume. 
 Sir, I've tracked usage of a damaged SIM card from the compound-- two calls. 
 Where to? 
 Tracing them now. 
 Sinclair : Ok. 
 Punch it through. 
 Ok. The first call was made to The Kepi Blanc, a hotel downtown. 
 Owned by Babarka Ba. 
 Anyone who wants to get out of Niger quietly, they go to BB. 
 He provides guides along the desert smuggling routes.

 You're arranging travel for a man crossing the border into Algeria. 
 Stonebridge : He's in a rush. 
 He's traveling light.

 Low level, no image. 
 Who does he work for specifically? 
 El Soldat. 
 Something doesn't scan. 
 Sinclair : Why not? 
 Axmali wanted to pass the triggers on to a believer. 
 El Soldat runs Aqim in Algeria. 
 They could never put together a nuclear weapon. 
 No, but they could afford the expertise. 
 El Soldat hasn't left the Hoggar Mountains for two years, and his people have been active outside that area for just as long. 
 Now all of a sudden he's blowing up CIA flights and chasing nuclear triggers. 
 Why? 
 Hmm. 
 We need to find out exactly who was on that flight.
