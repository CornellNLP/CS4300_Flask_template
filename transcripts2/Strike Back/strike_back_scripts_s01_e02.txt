 'A British TV journalist has been abducted near Basra.' 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 She took a photo with her phone and sent it to her office. 
 'The men holding Bratton used this boy as a suicide bomber.' 
 It's him, isn't it? 
 It looks like him. 
 He owes me a debt of honour. 
 'I demand the release of my brother, Mohammed Jassim Ali.' 
 'Unless this holy warrior is freed, the hostage will be executed.' 
 'Tell Porter he's been reactivated.' 
 (CHATTER AND TRAFFIC NOISE) 
 (CAR HORN BLASTS) 
 "Porter's gone AWOL, sir." Have you any idea where he might be headed? 
 "The tracker in his tooth has him 35 clicks east of here." 
 "30 degrees, 30.24 minutes north. 
 47 degrees, 49 point..." 
 ..at a safe house in an apartment block in Basra City. 
 Go, go, go! 
 "It's a southern suburb of Basra -" 
 Yes! 
 I know it. (SIGHS) Porter's chasing the only lead he has. 
 He's outside the safe house that was used to hold Kenneth Bratton. 
 Do you want me to contact Basra police, have them intercept Porter? 
 No. 
 He's waited seven years for a second chance. Let him have it. 
 (MOTOR STARTS) 
 (WOMAN'S VOICE INSIDE) 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 'Shoot him! John, shoot him!' 
 It's OK. 
 (PANTS) 
 '(WOMAN SHOUTS)' 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 (PANTS) 
 (WOMAN'S VOICE) > 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 "(QUIZZICAL PHONE CHATTER)" 
 "(WOMAN ON TV CHATTERS)" 
 Hakim Al Nazeri. 
 Hakim Al Nazeri! 
 "(BEEPS AND DIALS NUMBER)" 
 "(MAN ANSWERS)" 
 Hakim Al Nazeri. 
 "(PHONE DIALS)" 
 "(MAN ANSWERS)" 
 Hakim Al Nazeri. 
 "(PHONE BEEPS)" 
 Hakim Al Nazeri. 
 "(PHONE RINGS)" 
 '(MAN SHOUTS)' 
 (MUFFLED WARNING) 
 "(PHONE RINGS)" 
 We're both gonna have a much easier time if you can speak English. 
 I speak English. 
 Good. 
 Where is Hakim Al Nazeri? 
 I don't know what you're talk... 
 Aaaargh! Aieee! 
 Alright. Let's try that again, shall we? 
 Point one, our friends there came running after hearing his name. 
 Point two, before the invasion this place was a safe house for a hostage. 
 I know that, I was sent to get him out. 
 Point three, I'm gonna start using this knife in more inventive ways unless you tell me where they're holding the remaining 95 percent of the English infidel. 
 They will kill you, my friend. 
 Maybe. 
 Or maybe they'll hear what I've got to trade. 
 You need to ask yourself how much Hakim wants Jassim out of Belmarsh. 
 '(PHONE RINGS)' 
 Who is this? 
 Do you miss me? 
 "Porter!" 
 I contacted Sword of Islam. 
 I'm off to rendezvous with my pet theory. Hakim? 
 Could be a trap, could be a wild goose chase. 
 I'm gonna have to hang up now. 
 Porter, keep this line open. 
 Porter?! sh1t! 
 So, now we can't be traced, OK? 
 Take the next left. 
 What are you doing? 
 Call of nature. 
 This road better be flat. 
 Is this it? 
 You'll soon find out. 
 Out! 
 Aaargh! It hurts! 
 We really can't go on like this. 
 (BLASTS HORN) 
 All yours, hero. 
 (SPEAK IN ARABIC) 
 Who are you? I'm sorry, sir, I can't answer that question. 
 "(BEEPS)" 
 "(BEEPS RAPIDLY)" 
 "(CONTINUOUS TONE)" 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 (PORTER YELLS) 
 We've just lost Porter. 
 We've lost him, too. sh1t! 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 (MUFFLED ARABIC) 
 We lost contact with Bravo team at 15:21 GMT, 18:21 local time. 
 In our last communication he claimed to be heading to a rendezvous with a former Mukhabarat colonel, Hakim Al Nazeri, a man we believe might be the commander of Sword of Islam. 
 This satellite image of Al Kanan was Porter's last known position. 
 It was taken at 18:36 local time and shows four vehicles outside the building. Track the vehicles? 
 No. By the time we got a second satellite image an hour ago, the vehicles were gone. And Porter. 
 We have Charlie team on standby. 
 We can have then on the ground in Basra in five hours. 
 And a helicopter to where they might find clues to Katie's whereabouts. 
 Or a booby-trap. 
 We have less than 52 hours before they execute Katie. 
 If we delay - Hugh, count yourself lucky the Sword of Islam haven't already posted pictures of dead soldiers on their website. 
 Authorisation denied. 
 We've lost five men in 25 hours. 
 What did you expect? Sir, Porter has given us this location. 
 We can't let these men's deaths be in vain. I've no intention of that. 
 You find me another mission as cover... and you've got Charlie team. 
 Sir. 
 (BABY CRIES) 
 (DOOR BELL RINGS) 
 Hi, Alexandra. 
 Is your mother here? 
 Mum! 
 This is about my dad, isn't it? 
 Hugh. 
 Diane. 
 GCHQ monitoring recorded John has a lost signal. 
 Please speak English. 
 Alex. 
 Your father volunteered for a dangerous mission in Iraq. 
 Who sent him? 
 You know I can't tell you that. 
 You. You sent him, didn't you? 
 I can't go into detail but the manner in which we lost contact with John makes us feel that - 
 Don't you dare! Don't you dare! 
 My dad's not... (SOBS) 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, get off me! 
 You're a liar! 
 Alex... 
 Listen, um... I know how much you've done for John. Thank you. 
 But... the truth is, Er... we're all better off without him. 
 Diane, he was - 
 No, you're better off too. 
 Whatever it was that made you look out for him... it's gone. You're free. 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 Who are you? 
 Katie... 
 My name's John. 
 I'm SAS. 
 It's alright, don't be frightened. 
 Katie... we're gonna get you out of here. 
 OK? 
 You're a brave girl. 
 (SOBS) Brave girl. 
 Brave girl. 
 Shh. It's OK. 
 It's OK. 
 Shh. 
 Katie, look at me. Look at me. 
 Whatever happens, trust me! 
 You trust me! 
 You said you were here to negotiate. 
 Is that true? Sorry, sir, I can't answer that question. 
 What is your mission? I'm sorry, sir, I can't answer that question. 
 By what means do the British plan to rescue the hostage? 
 I'm sorry, sir, I can't answer that question. 
 No! No! No, no! 
 What are you doing?! No! 
 Tell me. 
 Let me talk to her! If she wants me to talk, she can tell me. 
 Katie. Katie, look at me. 
 Look at me. 
 Trust me. 
 Just so you know, I'm gonna kill every single of of these bastards. 
 (CRACK) 
 Tell me! I'm sorry, sir, I can't answer that question. 
 (CRACK) 
 Tell me! 
 I'm sorry, sir, I can't answer that question. (WHIMPERS) 
 (CRACK) 
 Leave her alone, you fucker! 
 (ARABIC) 
 (CRACK) 
 Leave her alone! 
 You let her suffer... to resist me. 
 You're not gonna kill her. Not while you still have her to bargain with. 
 Katie Dartmouth's death was inevitable the moment I took her. 
 But because of you, I'm forced to bring forward the deadline for her execution. 
 We will kill her tomorrow at dawn. 
 And you will be first. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 "(PHONE RINGS)" "Layla." "Charlie Team have been deployed undercover of a joint operation with our American friends." 
 "How quickly can you be where we lost Porter's signal?" 
 We can be airborne immediately. 
 Good work. 
 
 
 
 (WHIMPERS) Shh. It's OK. It's OK. 
 It's only me. It's John. 
 We're gonna get through this. 
 You and me. 
 You know that, don't you? 
 Yes. 
 Good girl. 
 I'm just gonna loosen these ropes to make you more comfortable. 
 Is that better? 
 Yeah. 
 How does that arm feel? 
 Just numb. 
 I need to have a look at it. 
 Is that OK? 
 Yeah. OK. 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 Clear! 
 'Clear!' 
 'Clear!' 
 How did you find me? The photo you took of the young man... led me to you. 
 Really, I just wanted an autograph. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Looks good. 
 There's no infection. 
 Now listen. 
 They'll come for me first. 
 That's our chance. I'll overpower them. Then I'll come back for you. 
 Gonna get you home, Katie. 
 I'll need to put this hood back on. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I understand. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Oh, please don't go. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I'm right here. I'm right here. 
 OK. OK. 
 'I think Porter might still be alive.' 
 'They've cleaned out, left the body of one of their soldiers.' 
 My guess is he's the man who led Porter to them. 
 If they left his body, Porter's would be there. It stands to reason. 
 There's a chance he's alive. We can effect a rescue. Sir. One moment. 
 All Islam locations are within 30 kilometres of each other. 
 If we centre a radius from the point of abduction, we narrow the search to specific sites. Know the car he was driving? 
 Yeah, a Range Rover. "Get back to base but be airborne by dawn." 
 We'll give you new coordinates for an aerial search. 
 You've got 25 hours, Layla. 
 There's still time. 
 (COMM) "This is Alpha. 
 Resuming search. Over." 
 (GASPS) Don't move. 
 What? What are we...? 
 Where are you taking me? John! 
 John, where are they taking me? 
 Oh, God! No! (WHIMPERS) 
 Don't be frightened! Trust me. 
 Help me! You b*st*rd! 
 You said you'd take me first! 
 I lied. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (SHOUTS) 
 Just coming up now, sir. 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 Our demand for the release of our brother has gone unheeded. 
 They have shown no intention of negotiating in good faith. 
 That is why we shall execute Katie Dartmouth in a few short minutes. 
 Layla, they've brought it forward. 
 They'll execute Katie this morning. 
 (SPEAK ARABIC) 
 (WHIMPERS) No! No! 
 (WHIMPERS) No! Don't! 
 '(THUDDING)' 
 No! No! No! 
 No! No! (WHIMPERS) 
 (SHOUTS) 
 Oh, God! No! 
 Katie! 
 (SPEAK ARABIC) 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 Don't shoot him. Don't. You know why I have to kill you, don't you? 
 Please! 
 I wanna hear you say it! 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) John, think. 
 He could have shot you. 
 This is for killing Mike and Keith and for Steve. 
 He says it wasn't him. 
 He says it wasn't him. 
 No sh1t. He's got a gun in his face! 
 Does he look like a killer? 
 He swears he didn't kill your friends. Who did? Tell me that. 
 We have to go now. (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 Move! 
 Go! Move! Move! 
 '(MEN SHOUTING)' 
 Go. 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 (COMM) "Heading north." 
 "Continuing towards the radius." 
 "Any developments?" They haven't uploaded the execution. 
 Until we hear otherwise, assume Katie and Porter are alive. 
 Hold on! 
 John. 
 Yep. 
 Give me a shout if you see a phone box. Telephone? 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) John. 
 f*ck. (DIALS PHONE) 
 (CELLPHONE RINGS) 
 Come on, pick up. 
 "This is Lieutenant Thompson. Please leave a message." sh1t. Redial. OK. 
 Hold on! 
 (TYRES SCREECH) 
 We need to get off this road. 
 "(PHONE RINGS)" 
 (CELLPHONE RINGS) 
 Hello? 
 Hello? John! 
 Layla? Layla, it's Porter. 
 Porter, thank God! Sir, we have contact from Bravo Team. 
 Hold on, Layla. 
 Right, get out, get down behind the wheels. 
 We have to make a stand. I have the hostage. We now have the hostage. 
 Bravo has Dartmouth, sir. 
 She's alive. 
 What's your position? 
 Repeat, what's your position, Bravo? 
 Just turned off a desert highway heading southwest at an intersection of high voltage pylons running north-south. 
 Two vehicles in pursuit. 
 "Found you. On our way. ETA four minutes. Repeat, four minutes." 
 f*ck. 
 Pass me that. I also have Scarface. 
 Repeat, I also... Layla? 
 "Porter?" 
 Layla! 
 "Porter, can you hear me?" 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 sh1t. 
 "We have a visual on the pylons." 
 "15km from target. 
 ETA three minutes." 
 f*ck. 
 sh1t. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 (SHOUTING IN ARABIC) 
 (SHOUTING / GUNFIRE) 
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) 
 No! Hold position! 
 There's someone else with Bravo, sir! 
 It's Scarface, sir! 
 "I'll put you on head-cam." 
 "Confirm, Bravo has the SOI soldier, designation Scarface!" 
 "Do we extract new contact?" 
 (VOICES FADE) 
 (ECHOING GUNFIRE) 
 "Do you copy?" 
 "Do we extract new contact with Bravo and hostage?" 
 Extraction denied. 
 Repeat, do not extract Scarface. 
 Copy. 
 "Landing now." 
 Stay low. 
 Head down! 
 Not you! On your knees! 
 Katie, sit here. 
 "This is 28 Alpha. 
 Hostage secure. Moving now." 
 What? What are you doing? 
 Wait! As'ad! 
 John, they're leaving him! 
 Layla, we need to go back now! 
 Orders from Collinson! 
 They'll kill him! 
 No! Collinson, we need to go back! 
 Now! 
 "Collinson, just give the order!" 
 "Zero, this is 28 Alpha. 
 Do we return?" 
 "Repeat, do we return? Over." 
 "Collinson, don't do this!" 
 "Collinson, you b*st*rd! Collinson! 
 Collinson!" 
 "The abducted television journalist Katie Dartmouth is recovering in a US air base after a daring rescue..." (DOORBELL RINGS) 
 "Although no details have been released by the Ministry of Defence, sources have told us that the rescue came moments before the deadline was announced for her execution." 
 "Miss Dartmouth is expected to fly home tomorrow morning." 
 "We have this report..." 
 Oh, my God! 
 Dad! Dad! (SOBS) 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Yeah? 
 John. 
 That's very kind. 
 (DISTANT VOICES SHOUT) 
 I'm one of the lucky ones. 
 I came home. 
 My father supported the invasion and the war that followed, an extension of which is still going on in Afghanistan. 
 My family have had a taste of what British forces and Iraqi families have gone through these past few years. 
 And we are humbled by it. 
 My heart goes out to those families on both sides whose loved ones will never come home. 
 I owe you an apology. 
 Oh? 
 You did an extraordinary thing out there. 
 Not gonna kiss me, are you? 
 No. 
 Don't get all sentimental on me like that. 
 I think I preferred you with low self-esteem. 
 What will you do now? 
 I'm gonna see a man about a job. 
 I'm glad you came in. 
 As a friend, I owe you an explanation about Scarface. 
 As'ad. 
 Yes. 
 As'ad. 
 I was forced to weigh the intelligence value he might have been able to provide against the risk he posed as a known terrorist. 
 Suppose he'd had a change of heart and tried to bring down the helicopter? 
 We could've lost Katie on the very brink of getting her to safety. 
 Katie,... I need you to tell me everything As'ad said to you. 
 About what happened the night you saved his life? Yeah. 
 He said... 
 He said that the man who killed your friends was another soldier. 
 An Iraqi soldier... or a British soldier? 
 You do understand, don't you, John? 
 Of course. 
 I would've done exactly the same thing if I was in your shoes. 
 Good. 
 Good. 
 So, have you come to a decision? 
 About our offer to join Section 20? 
 Yeah. 
 Yes, I have.
