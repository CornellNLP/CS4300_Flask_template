 (PANTING) 
 (CHATTERING) 
 I know, I'm coming. 
 If you want me to drag you out over my shoulder, just say so. 
 (GIGGLING) You can't treat me like that until we're married. 
 Five minutes, I promise. 
 No, now. You know it's not safe to stay. 
 The convoy is leaving. 
 Woman : Okay. 
 Okay, I'm coming. 
 (SPEAKING ARABIC) 
 Okay. 
 (SPEAKING ARABIC) 
 What's wrong? 
 It's his mother. They were collecting firewood. 
 The Janjaweed came. 
 Woman : Janjaweed? Where? 
 Oh! Okay. 
 Subin, can you take him? Yes. 
 (BOY SOBBING) 
 Easy. Just gently. 
 Can you hear me? 
 Okay, she's been stabbed. 
 And raped too, by the looks of it. 
 She's hemorrhaging completely. 
 We'll need to operate. 
 But Clare, we have no time. We have to get back to the security compound before dark. 
 If we leave now, she'll die. 
 Clare, we have had this discussion. 
 We cannot save everyone. 
 (SIGHS) Fine. Well, you tell him. 
 Go on, tell him, because I can't. 
 (SOBBING) 
 Tell him that we're gonna let his mother die because our ride home is waiting. 
 And then drag me out of here like you promised, because that is the only way that I'm leaving her now. 
 (SPEAKS ARABIC) 
 Hi. Hi, can you hear me? 
 I'm Doctor Clare Somersby, I'm here to help you. 
 So, how is she doing? 
 Good. 
 Clare : She's stable. 
 Thank you for staying. 
 (SPEAKING ARABIC) 
 He says you saved his mother's life, and with these, he will save yours. They're gris-gris. 
 No, I couldn't. 
 You're going to have to take them. 
 They are talismans. Very powerful. 
 (SPEAKING ARABIC) 
 Thank you. 
 He says his mother gave them to him for his protection and now he gives them to you. 
 (CLARE THANKS HIM IN ARABIC) 
 They are coming. 
 (GASPS) 
 (SPEAKING IN ARABIC) 
 (WHOOPING) 
 Bakri : Get up, get up, get up. 
 Go, go, go, go! Get up, get up! 
 Najim, sweetheart, she's still sedated, she can't be moved. 
 (WHINNYING) 
 Come on, we have to go! 
 Clare, quick! 
 Clare : Bakri, we can't just leave him! 
 Enough talk of martyrdom. 
 We have to survive, or else our purpose here will become meaningless. 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 (GLASS SHATTERING) 
 Go! Okay. 
 (WHINNYING) 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 Okay. 
 Go, go, go! 
 (YELLING) 
 (SCREAMING IN ARABIC) 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 Back, back, back, back! 
 Okay. 
 I think we should split up. 
 No! 
 Maybe there's a way I can draw them, create a diversion. 
 We stick together. Always. 
 (CLOPPING) 
 (WHISPERING) Okay. 
 Go, go, go, go, go! 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 Bakri! 
 Bakri : Run. 
 Clare : Are you okay? 
 Just go! 
 Bakri : Run! 
 Bakri : Run!

 Episode 5 
 Original Air Date on September 16, 2011 
 (DISTORTED) Michael. 
 Michael. 
 Michael! 
 That blonde hottie on the plane? 
 Got her number. 
 Yeah? 
 Right. New target. 
 Ex-Royal Marine, turned global arms dealer. Gerald Crawford. 
 We have growing evidence that Crawford supplied the weapons used at the hotel siege in New Delhi, as well as those used by Connolly in the Cape Town heist. 
 So the explosives that killed Kate, they're from him. 
 He's Latif's chief armory. 
 Grant : And normally ultra security-conscious, never directly connected to the weapons he supplies, until now. 
 Two days ago Mombasa police broke a shipyard smuggling ring led by this man, Central Yard controller Ken Masoto. 
 Richmond :  Now, Masoto confessed that Crawford bribed him  to let through an illegal arms shipment destined for Sudan. 
 What's more,  Crawford will personally supervise the transfer onto trucks for overland transportation to Darfur. 
 He'll be traveling with his head of security, Dieter Hendricks, former South African Special Forces. 
 They're meeting at the docks tonight. This is our chance to get to Latif. I want Crawford alive. All right. Fox is in the coop. Scott : (ON COMMS)  You can shoot his bodyguard if that's any consolation. The customs papers have been processed as promised. It is all in order. As soon as Crawford confirms the shipment and signs the ledger, move in. Number TN-3 form, to authorize transport of chemical fertilizer. I have to sign for it, right? Don't worry, I've got a spare one in the car. What's a TN-3 form? There isn't one. sh1t. They made us, Scott! Track the feed. I want eyes on, now. (PANTING) Just give me a bead. Tell me where he's at. Looking. Look for Hendricks, too. Copy that. Stonebridge : (ON COMMS)  Where the f*ck is he? Got him, Sector 2, primary target  heading towards the storage facilities. Sector 2? I'm in Sector 2. (GUN COCKS) f*ck. Who are you? British Military Intelligence. It's over, Crawford. Be smart. You've lost the shipment, but we can still cut a deal. Don't tell me what I've lost. (GRUNTS) Heading to Sector 2. (STONEBRIDGE MOANS) You all right? Stonebridge : Yeah. (GRUNTS) See what happens when you go off without me? Then f*cking keep up. Still no visual. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) f*cking... (GROANS) GRANT: (ON COMMS)  Scott, what's your position? Sinclair : Sounds like Hendricks found him first. Richmond : Scott? Find me Crawford. Sinclair : The car's on the move. sh1t. (TIRES SQUEALING) Hey! Come on. f*ck. (GRUNTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) Crawford : Go! You know what to do! (GRUNTING) I believe you have a deal you want to offer me. You sick f*ck. (GAGGING) Scott : Mike, Mike! Easy, tiger! Hey, Grant said alive. Come here. Scott : Hands on your head. Keep 'em there. (WHISPERING) f*ck. And my reward for this betrayal? If the information you provide leads to Latif's arrest, you get a reduced sentence in a British jail. Or you can rot in some African hellhole for the rest of your life. Well, information such as his point man in Europe? Very well. I've heard your terms, now you listen to mine. That arms deal was a humanitarian ransom payment, being made in exchange for a British aid worker, a doctor, held hostage in Darfur. Yeah, yeah, of course it was. Once the weapons arrived in Khartoum, she was to be released. When did you get into the humanitarian ransom business? She's my daughter. Get me my daughter back, and I'll give you Latif. My name is Clare Somersby, and I am an aid worker. And I am here to heal people... (CAPTOR SCREAMING IN ARABIC) (WHIPPING SOUND) (CLARE GROANS) (CAPTOR SPEAKING ARABIC) (WHIPS) How the f*ck did we miss this? The Embassy in Khartoum is aware of Clare's abduction, but no link was flagged to Crawford. Richmond : She uses her mother's maiden name, Clare's parents separated when she was 12, and she's had no contact with Crawford since. Grant : Someone knew. The tape was sent to him direct. She was deliberately targeted to ensure he got the weapons. f*cked him and ourselves then, haven't we? I say we get Guantanamo on his ass. Give us ten minutes with him, he'll spill his guts on Latif no problem. And she becomes what? Just another dead woman we've sacrificed for the cause? Would he talk? Or would he just sit there thinking about how his daughter was suffering and beg you to hit him even harder? Well, f*ck it. Find out where she is, we'll go and do a snatch-and-grab. Sinclair : The Janjaweed are nomadic. They could be holding Clare anywhere. Grant : No. We need Crawford to offer them cash instead of arms. I want them to bring her to us. Where? Darfur. (WARRIOR SPEAKING ARABIC THROUGHOUT) (GROANS) (GROANS) Bakri : Clare, just leave it. He will be one of them soon. Subin : Like all of the children they take from us. No. Najim, no, stop it! Don't! You don't have to do this, none of you have to do this! (SPEAKING ARABIC) Get off me! (SCREAMS) (SPEAKING ARABIC) My name is Tahir. And if you insist on provoking my men like this, they will behave like men. This is gris-gris. Yes. He gave them to me. I will take them. No. Clare... I will give them to you. As a gift. To keep you safe. I have enough protection, not least in the shipment of arms your father is sending me to ensure you return unharmed. (CHUCKLES) When the guns arrive, you will be released. But until then, you will earn your food and water by treating my men. We will. Thank you. I need only one doctor. No! No, Bakri! (SOBBING) Bakri! No, sweetheart! Subin! And sadly, his father is worthless. You b*st*rd! (TAHIR SPEAKS IN ARABIC) (SOBBING) No! No! No! Bakri! Get off me! No! I can't believe we're doing this sh1t. We won't let him supply weapons, but he can give them this cash to buy those same weapons someplace else? As long as it gets us intel on Latif, what do you care? Matak's already here. He's waiting for us in the restaurant. The Janjaweed eat in hotels? Matak is the government minister conducting negotiations on my behalf. As far as he's concerned, you're my employees, so act accordingly. If he even guesses at the truth, it's over. Scott : (WHISPERING) Cocksucker. Well, dip me in sh1t and call me Colonel. Now I know I've got a story. Damien? Who is that? A journo. War zone junkie. We f*cked a couple of times. Get rid of her. Hey, Maggie. What are you doing here? Just give me the headlines. Is it juicy? Should I grab the table next to you and make notes? No, no, no. Uh, why don't we make this a liquid lunch, for old times' sake? Oh, what about your friend? Is he coming too? He looks kinda fun. Well, he's English. So, no, on both counts. Maggie : Now, I seem to remember... (CONVERSATION FADES OUT) Ah, Captain Crawford, my friend.   As-salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam. You understand we have to be conscious of security in these troubled times. I'm afraid I have some bad news. They have killed one of the hostages. Matak : Not your daughter,  subhanallah,  but another doctor. I have warned you we are dealing with a very volatile man. This will not be an easy matter to resolve. I think we're going to need a bigger case. Is it Special Ops? You going to render Bashir? Make him stand trial for war crimes? Snatch the President of Sudan? Well, why not? He's already been indicted by the courts. Everyone knows the Janjaweed operates on his say-so. True. Cheers. Something's going down. I've been seeing you guys all over lately. What guys? Mercs. PMC assholes. Here. He look like a tourist to you? I swear I've seen him in fatigues somewhere. Do you recognize him? Wasn't Iraq, was it? Kosovo? (CHUCKLES) The snake guy's a Russian called Grigor. Right. Where'd you take these? Some shebeen, not far from here. You want to tell me where it is? Quid pro quo. Who are those guys you were with? What was in those cases? Heh. Hey, what did you just do? Well, I'm going to find out who that guy is, then I'm going to the place where you took those photos. Catch you later. That was not the deal and you know it. (WHISTLES) Hey, I got a driver. (MAGGIE WHISTLES) Scott : Awesome. Maggie : Jacoub! Hey hottie, it's me. We good to talk dirty again? Yes, the line is secure. They're chewing over the bribe now. I got a photo to send you. Love ya. Grant : Get me an ID. (CLUCKING) (LAUGHS) They don't mind if you don't. (CAR STARTING) Driver : My name is Jacoub. You are American also, yes? I have made arrangements for the exchange. We are meeting them at noon tomorrow. You have the weapons ready to deliver? No. But I have this as collateral. And a sign of my good faith in concluding the deal. (MATAK GRUNTS) But Tahir will want weapons. And he'll get them, I promise. When I have my daughter back safe and unharmed, I will release the weapons immediately. They'll be nearby. Now, there is one suitcase for Tahir, and this one will be for you alone, for all your endeavors in ensuring that our two parties meet as arranged. My deepest gratitude, as always, to a true friend. Salut. What the hell was that? You're offering them weapons now? You've seen what we're dealing with. If I'd said we had no arms, what do you think they'd do to Clare, huh? This way, at least I've made sure they'll bring her. Crawford, you tell me what happens when they find out the truth. This was your f*cking plan. If she dies, if you've killed her by stopping that shipment... I lost her once. Fifteen years ago, when her mother took her. I'm not gonna lose her again. All right. We'll get her back. No matter what it takes. 
 
 (CHATTERING) Maggie : So that's it over there. You want Jacoub to wait? (CHICKEN CLUCKING) Oh, sh1t, that's him! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Richmond :   I have an ID on that photo. The man's name is Andre Botha. He's a South African mercenary frequently hired by Crawford's private security firm. He's been playing us all along. No sh1t. We gotta follow him. Let's go. Okay. Uh-uh. Not yet. Jacoub, get out. I'm driving. Not until you tell me what this is all about. Maggie, not now. I'll tell you while I'm driving. Jacoub, get out of the car. No! What's in it for me? Maggie : You better talk fast. Scott : Get out of the f*cking car. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. This is my car! So get in. Maggie : You are such a piece of work, you know that? Maggie, not now. Yeah, we've been compromised. We need to extract the principal. No, we can't risk them aborting the exchange. I've got a tail to shake, I'll see you later. Out. sh1t. He's made us. You couldn't just do what I say, could you? Always gotta put the squeeze on, and try and get something for yourself. Sound familiar? If we lose him, I'm never gonna sleep with you again. Ever! Like I'd miss those three seconds. (SCOFFS) What is happening? Plan B. Buckle up. (WHIMPERS) Dieter : He was there, man, I'm telling you. That f*cking man from the shipyard is tailing us. Fucker. I see them! Jacoub : I see! Yeah, I got 'em. Where the f*ck's he gone? Do you see him? Negative. You wanna hold on? (TIRES SQUEALING) f*ck! That hurt? What do you got here, huh? f*ck me. You guys are tooled up for a war! (GUN COCKS) Scott : Yeah. (WHIMPERING) All right. Thank you very much. You all right? You f*cking son of a bitch! Yeah, you sound fine. You? My car! Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll buy you a new one. My car! You! Get out of the car. Get out of the f*cking car right now! Scott : Leave it. (CLUCKING) (SPEAKING ARABIC) Get in the car. Get in the car! Jacoub, get in! I've taken two of 'em out. I got their weapons, but I'm thinking there's more. That guy in the photo with the snake tattoo is a Russian called Grigor? He's a Chechen. Grigor Tchevsky. We're cross-referencing border controls. Andre Botha, Grigor Tchevsky,  and a third mercenary, Casper Bryce. They all flew into Khartoum on the same flight two days ago. We're sending the information to Stonebridge now. Stonebridge : Major. (KNOCKING) Man : Room service. We haven't ordered anything. Man : It's for Mr. Crawford. Compliments of the hotel. Why don't you leave it outside, we'll collect it later. He needs to sign for it. Just a moment. (WHISPERING) Shut the door for him. (LOCKS DOOR) (QUIETLY) There's one other man, just off to the side. Get ready. What are you going to use? They brought it with them. Okay. Hi, come in. Come on in. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Nice work. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) You really should pay your driver more. This place is a hovel. (CLUCKING) I have to deliver these. Sorry, buddy. I know it's your home. This is just a room. They were my home. (DOOR OPENS) Janjaweed. (DOOR CLOSES) Maggie : He had a farm, once. They destroyed that, too. Quite a gash you got on your head. Let me have a look at that. (SIGHS) Oh, yeah. (GASPING) When I found out Clare was working in Sudan I approached Matak, and bribed him to have her visa revoked. Instead he had her abducted. He played distraught, of course. Promised to personally liaise with the Janjaweed to broker the deal to get her back. For a fee. So, you see, if I hadn't made him aware of her value, I couldn't trust that they'd deliver her to me even once they had the weapons, so I had Dieter prepare a covert team to plan to be at the exchange just in case. They were in place before my arrest. What they've done since is without my knowledge or guidance. How many others are on the team? Two more. Dieter and Andre. They've both been taken out. Then Clare's in your hands now. Clare :   My whole life,  everything I have done has been a "f*ck you" to his wars, and the blood money he's made from fueling them. (SNIFFS) And now he's using it all to save me. Well that is not saving me. Not like that. Please, not like that. (SPEAKING ARABIC) (GUARDS SPEAKING ARABIC) (MOANS) (CLARE MOANING) (GROANS) That man that you murdered, where are they taking him? To a wadi near here. It is almost full. But there is still room for a few more bodies. He's my fiance. I want to give him a proper burial. And what will you give me in return? Nothing you can't take. Colonel, it's Sinclair. I think we should abort. We're too exposed. What about Stonebridge? He wants to continue. But I'm convinced Crawford's double-crossing us. We have no idea how many more of these guys are out there. All right. Stonebridge knows what he's doing. And we need that intel on Latif. Where's Scott? Gathering intelligence, apparently. He said he'll meet us at the exchange. Well, make sure he gets there. It's Scott's job to watch your back. Lucky me. Maggie, I said no. It's too dangerous. Bullshit! The arms dealer's daughter? That's like my Pulitzer Prize right there! I said no! And I still think there's more you're not telling me! Where's the car? Which car? The f*ckin' car we stole. Where is it? I took it back. You f*cking kidding me? His driving license was inside. With his address. I didn't know you still wanted it. Of course I still want it! If I don't get to that exchange point, people are gonna die. You understand that? Okay, so we'll just steal another one, okay? Where from? The only transport around here is a f*ckin' goat! My neighbor has a car. He will lend it to you, I promise. Come with me, and show me, right now. Scott : You call this piece of sh1t a car? f*ck. How long till we get there? Soon. Relax. Everything is prepared, is it not? Everything's prepared. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Richmond : Stonebridge? We have new intelligence. We're cross-referencing border controls. Another three of Crawford's men arrived in Sudan yesterday. Grant :   Looks like you're gonna have company. All right. Problem? No. I have a visual on the boss. (ON WALKIE)  As soon as he has his daughter, we take out the special forces. Roger that. We spotted anyone? That abandoned bus. The barn. Maybe the walkway. I don't see anyone. Neither can I, but that's where I'd put men. So what's my role? Apart from sitting duck? You grab the girl. She'll make a perfect shield. No one's going to shoot you with her in the way. Doesn't sound very chivalrous. But I like it. Yeah, good plan. Where the f*ck are you, Scott? If you don't hurry up, you're gonna miss the party. (GUNS COCKING) Crawford... Clare? Clare! It's okay. You're gonna be fine. I'm gonna bring you home with me. And the trucks? The shipment of arms that you promised? Where are they? They're coming. When I have my daughter. (COCKS GUN) Show me them. Now. He will bring them soon! And offers this as collateral! Scott : Jacoub, you got this? Hold this. Sure. (SPEAKING ARABIC) (CHUCKLES) It is not money that the UN denies us. (SPEAKING ARABIC) I have the weapons. You'll get them shortly. Just give me my daughter, take the money! I'll release them! (GRUNTS) (SPEAKS ARABIC) (CAMERA CLICKING) (CHUCKLES) This is what your money has bought. (SCREAMS) (CLARE MOANING) (SOBS) Tahir : A useful aid, for a father who will not hear and does not listen. Kill him! (YELLS IN ARABIC) f*cking kill them! Crawford : All of them! (SCREAMS) Duck! Get down! Come on! Anyone hit? No. (YELLING IN ARABIC) sh1t. Keep him alive! I'll do my best. (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) Gotcha. (GROANS) (TEARING FLESH) Clare! Stonebridge : Clare, to me! Clare! Get down to the ground! (GRUNTS) f*ck! Clare! (GROANS) Whoah, whoah, whoah! Just go back inside. Go back, it's all right. Stay inside. f*ck. What're you doin', cocksucker? Where the f*ck have you been? Saving your life! Clare! Stay down! Come on, Jacoub. Come on, buddy. Talk to me! You going for the girl? Stonebridge : That's what we came for, isn't it? Let's move! Comin' to ya! Cover me. (ON WALKIE)   I'm going to go in for the principal. Clare, come here! Clare, move! Ahhh! (GASPS) (SCREAMING) Michael, the girl! Ahhh! Hang in there. Come on! f*ck. You get him? Scott : Oh, f*ck! sh1t. Did he get you? Is he okay? Scott? Stonebridge : Scott... (HIGH-PITCHED WHINE) Stonebridge : Scott look here, look here, look here! It's gonna be okay. Stonebridge : Stay with me. Stonebridge : Stay with me, Scott! Scott! (FINGERS SNAPPING) Hey, Scott. Scott! (SCOTT GROANS) What's that? It's uh, it's morphine. Oh, gimme. I love that sh1t. (GRUNTING) Did we get the girl? No, not yet. f*ck. sh1t. He's bleeding out. You gotta get him to a hospital, fast. Come on, let's go! Sinclair : We're gonna patch you up. The f*ck are you doing? I'm getting my daughter back, and I'm taking that car. No! No. You need "a" car, and a better car than this piece of sh1t if you have any hope of getting across that desert. Now, my friends are taking this, and you and I are taking one of those Janjaweed technicals. Sinclair, take this gun in case there's trouble along the way. You tell Grant what happened. Are you seriously going on? I have to find that intel on Latif. Oh, like that's the reason you're going, Mike. Come on. You're outgunned, you got no backup, huh? How're you gonna even find her? You don't know where the f*ck to look. I do. Scott : What the f*ck is he saying? My village was near here. I can help you. All right. Let's all go. The morphine's kicking in. I'm up for a road trip. No, you're going to a hospital before you bleed to death. He, he's gonna die before me. Stupid f*cking Brit. Yo, there's tools in the back. You go kick some ass. Thanks. Go. Drive. Let's do this.
