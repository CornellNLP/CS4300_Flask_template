 You listen for my signal. 
 [MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE NEARBY] 
 Where'd he go? 
 Scott : I got an alleyway on my right... potential exit. 
 I've got open ground, armed hostiles. 
 Go? 
 Move. 
 Cover me! 
 [MAN SCREAMING THEN RACHEL WHISTLES] 
 Scott : Move forward. 
 Richmond : Cover me! 
 Go, go. 
 Move! 
 Go! 
 Richmond : Michael, pull back! 
 Come on! 
 Scott! 
 Coming! 
 You must clear Waabri's sector and get to an African Union-controlled area. 
 His sector extends to over a square mile. 
 She's not the sodding junior attache, is she? 
 Stonebridge : In there. Against the wall. 
 Here, here. Go, go. 
 So who the f*ck are you, Rachel? 
 My name is Rachel. Rachel Dalton. 
 Military Intelligence. 
 That explains why you're such a good liar. 
 And you are Scott, kicked out of Delta and picked off the scrap heap by Eleanor Grant. 
 Scott : Roll with us, then no more lies and no more secret bullshit. 
 You've got no secrets, Damien? 
 Is that what you want your friends to believe? 
 What were you doing for those eight years after Iraq? 
 Stonebridge : We could do with a way out. 
 Baxter : We've got satellite of the street, but it's crawling with hostiles. 
 Do what you can to navigate out. Keep moving. 
 We gotta move. Let's go. 
 Dalton : With me. 
 Sinclair : We're doing everything we can... but for now, you're on your own. 
 It was you who killed the Libyan. 
 He reneged on an agreement to furnish me with the items you have. 
 However... I accept you received them in good faith. 
 As such, I am prepared to offer you an appropriate sum to obtain the case. 
 Why should I... believe you? 
 Mr. Waabri, this is the young lady who took the shot you witnessed. 
 One half millimeter adjustment of her rifle scope, and right now... it would be your brains being eaten off the floor by rats. 
 The Libyan had it coming. 
 But I will play fair with you... until you give me reason not to. 
 A generous sum by any standards. 
 It's clean. 
 I'll contact you on it. 
 You'll have made your decision by then. 
 Sinclair : How many hours of darkness left? 
 Baxter : Six, sir. 
 We have to get them out of there by first light. 
 Stonebridge : Stop. Wait. Wait. 
 Go with them. Go. Go. 
 Richmond : Go. 
 Go. 
 Stonebridge : Behind me. Here. 
 Sinclair : Scott, have we ID 'd our mystery guest? 
 Her name is Rachel Dalton. 
 Check it. 
 Sir. 
 If you want me to shoot her, just give me the word. 
 She's kind of a bitch. 
 Sir. Yeah, she's one of ours. 
 Get Scott to put her on. 
 Scott : My boss wants a word. 
 Looks like you check out. 
 I'm thrilled. 
 So am I. 
 Dalton : This is Rachel Dalton. 
 Captain, Major Oliver Sinclair, commanding Section 20. 
 I need you to find me Waabri's whereabouts. 
 You f*cking what? 
 Sinclair : I want my men out of there. 
 And I need to find Waabri. 
 You will obey the orders of a-- 
 Negative. I have command on the ground. 
 If you have a problem, I suggest you contact General Bennett. 
 You know the general? 
 Enough to know he would never... have sanctioned a second rescue mission, but I'm sure he would love to hear about it. 
 Tell her. 
 Waabri's current whereabouts are unknown. 
 We're monitoring all comms traffic in his sector. 
 Burton : You know we've dishonored him by escaping. 
 He'll want more than ransom this time. 
 Axmali : I heard news of your prisoners' escape. 
 Could I offer any assistance? 
 That will not be necessary. 
 I take solace from the knowledge that... the more a believer deals with devils... the closer he will come to the true purpose of his life. 
 Perhaps, brother, you have taken possession of something... you know in your heart belongs to Allah. 
 Why must you listen to him? 
 We can sell what's in the case. 
 [IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Now. Now! 
 [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE OVER PA] 
 [SHOUTS] 
 Bravo, you have numerous hostiles inbound. 
 Get him back. 
 Burton : Here. 
 [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Scott : Back, back, back. 
 [GUNFIRE NEARBY] 
 [TRUCK DRIVING AWAY] 
 All clear. 
 Burton : There's a price on our heads now. 
 I did warn you. 
 Baxter, this is Scott. 
 What have you got for me? 
 Baxter : The whole town's after you. All routes back to the African Union safe zone are shut. 
 Yeah. No sh1t, Einstein. You got an evac? 
 Sinclair : We've managed to secure a chopper in Northern Kenya. 
 It will be with you before daybreak. 
 Sergeant Baxter is sending over coordinates now for a rendezvous. 
 In the meantime, find more secure cover. 
 Sinclair. 
 Sinclair : Go ahead. 
 I need you to contact Langley, ask for a woman named Christy Bryant. 
 Ask her for the location of the nearest CIA safe house. 
 If she gives you any bullshit, tell her it's me that's asking. 
 Do it. 
 Mike? 
 Dalton : Psst. 
 Come on. Go. 
 Burton : Here we go. 
 f*ck. 
 Nice place. 
 Yeah. 
 Great a.c Bet you she rocks in the sack. 
 [SCOTT CHUCKLES] 
 Why the f*ck are you here? 
 You were doing such a good job on your own. 
 Shut up. I was doing fine. 
 Seriously, what happens if we don't make it out? 
 How did you sell it to Kerry? 
 I hate it when you do this. 
 What's that? 
 Talk like a grown-up. 
 It happens sometimes. 
 [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] 
 My people were attacked. 
 Matlock : That's unfortunate. 
 Maybe you should move to a nicer neighborhood. 
 You know nothing about this? 
 I don't know, Mr. Waabri, and I don't care. 
 Do you want to complete our transaction and sell me the case or not? 
 Where? 
 Matlock : Choose a location. Meet me there in an hour. 
 Baxter : We just intercepted a call to Waabri. 
 He's arranged a meeting in the next hour... with an unknown American male to exchange the case. 
 Sinclair : He's just texted a set of coordinates. 
 How far? 
 Sinclair : One klick from your current location. 
 Uploading now. 
 Waabri's arranged a rendezvous to exchange the case. 
 We have to go. 
 You wanna drag two kids and an old man into this? 
 What's in the case? 
 That's need-to-know. 
 I got a f*cking need. 
 That's rich coming from someone in Bryant's little black book. 
 f*ck you. 
 [TRUCK APPROACHING] 
 [MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Clear. 
 So, what's in the case? 
 I think the case contains four neutron initiators. 
 Scott : You think? 
 Nuclear triggers. 
 Why didn't you tell me this before? 
 This is a classified mission. 
 You don't get to ask. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 If Waabri is trying to sell them, do you have any idea... what possession of those triggers could mean in the wrong hands? 
 Woman : Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 [WOMAN GRUNTING] 
 Yeah. 
 When you get the money... we will be free of this. 
 A new life together. 
 A new life. 
 Away from here. 
 Yes. 
 [BOTH MOANING] 
 [WAABRI GRUNTING] 
 Promise to take me with you. 
 All right, Scott, Richmond can take Burton and the boys to the safe house. 
 They'll sit tight. We can go after the triggers, and everyone will meet up at the chopper RV. 
 You're out of your mind. 
 You babysit the kids, then. 
 I'm not babysitting the kids. 
 Besides that, you're too rusty to do this on your own. 
 On my worst day... 
 In your dreams, buddy. 
 For chrissake, cut the Laurel and Hardy routine. 
 Laurel and Hardy? 
 You know what she means by that? 
 Scott : What? 
 She thinks you're fat. 
 Scott : Shut up. 
 Dalton : The safe house will give you cover until it's time for the evac. 
 You're in good hands with Sergeant Richmond. 
 All right. 
 I'll see you on the other side. 
 Okay? 
 Go. 
 Hold there. 
 Stonebridge : Gentleman's persuader. 
 Burton : Okay. 
 Scott : Big man, that's for you. 
 All right, go. 
 Burton : Come on, boys. Go, go, go. 
 Quickly. Quickly. 
 Stonebridge : We good? 
 Clear. 
 Move out. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Kerry : Hello? 
 I'm looking for Michael Stonebridge. 
 Dalton : How far to the hand-over point? 
 Stonebridge : Half a klick. 
 Think she's done this before? 
 Yeah, it looks like it, buddy. 
 If only your recruits could see you now, Michael. 
 What do they say? 
 "Those that can't do, teach"? Huh? 
 f*ck off. 
 What's up with you? 
 Mike? 
 What happened to your brother-- 
 His name was Jake. 
 It was... 
 The training can be mentally very-- 
 He was a fine soldier. 
 Of course. 
 Losing someone like this must be-- 
 I can't... 
 But you know Michael. 
 You know that he's a good man. 
 He's very lucky to have you. 
 Stonebridge : I had no choice. I had to take him out. 
 How'd you not see that coming? 
 I don't know. I did, but... 
 Scott : How'd it get that far? 
 Sinclair know about this? 
 sh1t. 
 Psst. 
 Baxter : Good news. 
 The chopper is 90 minutes away. 
 Richmond : Roger that. 
 Burton : Call this a safe house? 
 Richmond : Don't worry. We will get you home. 
 Burton : You mean Britain? 
 I sacrificed a marriage... and God knows how many promotions so that I could stay here in Africa. 
 Then some prick in Whitehall decides that it's too expensive to keep me on. 
 I've got more in common with these boys than I have with anyone back home. 
 Aw, no. I'm sorry. 
 [GLASS SHATTERS, THEN GUN COCKING] 
 Burton : Down. Get down. 
 Zero, we've been compromised. 
 Baxter : Get out now. Northwest exit clear. 
 Richmond : Waabri's men will be here any minute. We have to go. 
 Hey! You, get down! 
 Get down on the ground! 
 Burton : No! 
 Friend. 
 Old friend. 
 [BURTON SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Sulaimani : "The embers of hope..." 
 Burton : "Glow in our children's hearts." 
 Sulaimani : You remembered. 
 Burton : Everything. 
 Sulaimani : Then it still lives. 
 Burton : Waabri put guns in these children's hands... but they decided to come with us. 
 You won't bury them today. 
 Listen. 
 I have watched over you, but this is the toughest part of the city. 
 Richmond : Come on. 
 God knows how we're gonna get there unseen. 
 
 
 
 Scott : Zero, this is Bravo 1. 
 Baxter : Sir. 
 Sinclair : Target has arrived. 
 Set the device and find your position. 
 Scott : Right. 
 Shut up, Sinclair. I'm working on it. 
 [MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Zero, this is Bravo 1, in position. 
 Stonebridge : Zero, in position. 
 Sinclair : Copy that. 
 Scott : Here comes the money man now. 
 That's the full amount in untraceable bonds. 
 You're a rich man. 
 Scott : All right. 
 You got the guy coming down the stairs with the case? 
 Sinclair : Copy that. 
 Scott : Go. 
 Showtime. 
 [GUNFIRE] 
 Matlock : Run it back. 
 Scott : sh1t! 
 f*ck! 
 [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Stonebridge : Move! 
 Matlock : Drive. 
 Aah. Aah! 
 Scott : Go, go, go! 
 Stonebridge : Now, Scott. Now. Hit it now! 
 I need a flight check on that Huey. 
 Richmond : Zero, we're at the rendezvous. 
 We still have the chopper? 
 Affirmative. 
 Baxter : Bird is in the air. 
 Agreed location in 10 minutes. 
 Sinclair : Julia, exfil in 10. 
 Scott : Richmond? 
 Richmond : Here. 
 Scott : Coming in. 
 Richmond : Clear. 
 Scott : All right. 
 Old man. 
 Kids. 
 Richmond : Friendly. 
 Zero, in position. 
 Baxter : Kestrel 1. Kestrel 1. 
 This is Zero. Are you receiving? 
 Kestrel 1, come in. Confirm exfil. 
 Repeat. Please confirm exfil. 
 Man [over radio] : Zero, this is Kestrel 1. 
 We're taking heavy fire. 
 Abort! Abort! 
 Are you kidding me? 
 What? 
 f*ck. 
 Baxter : Hold positions, Bravo. 
 We need a new exfil plan. 
 I need to speak to General Olusu immediately. 
 Stonebridge : sh1t. A vehicle. Move. Move. 
 Down, down, down. 
 Get down. 
 Sergeant Baxter. 
 I want you to listen very carefully. 
 African Union forces... 
 [GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE] 
 Zero? Zero, come in. 
 Come in. 
 Come on, guys. We're gonna die out here. 
 Bravo 1, this is Zero. 
 The major has an exfil plan, but it is unsanctioned. 
 We cannot broadcast over comms. 
 You have to trust us. 
 You need to locate some transport immediately. 
 Maybe I can help you. 
 Scott : Keys. 
 Anybody see an entrance to the freeway, just let me know. 
 Keep heading in this direction. 
 I've found you a way out. 
 Scott : No, no. 
 sh1t! 
 Dalton : Hold on! 
 f*ck! 
 Scott : sh1t. 
 Keep your heads down. 
 Dalton : Zero, come in. 
 Go west. Take the alley. 
 Buildings there for cover. 
 Case. 
 Here's your triggers. 
 Stonebridge : Dalton, Scott, let's move. 
 Richmond : Come on! 
 Scott : Moving. 
 Got it. 
 Come on. 
 Go. 
 Come on. Go on. 
 Dalton : Clean left. 
 Stonebridge : Switch. 
 [MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Scott : Coming up. 
 All right, what's the plan? 
 Straight ahead. 
 Scott : Guess I'm going, huh? 
 Stonebridge : Move. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 All right, come with me. 
 Stonebridge : Moving. 
 GO, go! 
 [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 f*ck. We got company, Michael. 
 You got company on your six as well. 
 Let's go. 
 Scott : What are we doing? 
 Baxter : Bravo, secure a defensive position. 
 [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Scott : All right, move, move. 
 Stonebridge : Far corner. Far corner there. 
 Bad corner. Zero? 
 Zero, come in. Hostiles approaching. 
 We're short on ammo and we have no way out. 
 We'd love a plan. 
 Baxter : We've got your position, we need you to hold. 
 We got a lot of hostiles out here, Michael. 
 Baxter, where's our f*cking exfil? 
 Hold positions. 
 I'm finding an exit. 
 [STONEBRIDGE GRUNTING] 
 [FLIES BUZZING] 
 [MEN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE NEARBY] 
 Baxter : Bravo, be aware. 
 There are hostiles approaching from your east, appear heavily armed. 
 No sh1t. 
 Michael, what did you find? 
 I found some ammo. There's no way out. 
 We need to hold this position. 
 We're in a kill zone. 
 Burton : Down. Get down. 
 Scott : You got something for me? 
 Mag? 
 Thanks. 
 I need one too. 
 Burton. 
 [GUNFIRE] 
 Stonebridge : sh1t. Zero, engaging hostiles! 
 f*ck me! 
 Zero, whose is that bird? 
 sh1t. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Baxter : Bravo, chopper is not friendly. 
 This is not an exfil. 
 Scott : Get down! Down! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Scott : They're doing a good job of scaring off the locals. 
 Sinclair : Bravo, repeat. This is not exfil. 
 Treat as hostile. Treat as hostile. 
 Yeah! 
 Buddy, I need you to back me up on this! 
 What? 
 Just follow my lead. 
 You know what I want! 
 Give me the case. 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 Give me the f*cking case, lady. 
 I will have your head on a plate! 
 You're about to look very f*cking stupid. 
 Stand still and show me your f*cking hands! 
 You want this, you give me him! 
 That's a smart move. 
 Any chance is better than none, huh? 
 You! 
 Good luck. 
 Like you give a sh1t. 
 You know what? 
 Come here. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 Waabri : Allah has taken your weapons. 
 You came here for nothing. 
 Scott : f*ck! 
 sh1t! 
 Scott : That plan went to sh1t. 
 Stonebridge : What? 
 Scott : He took out Waabri. 
 We got nothing to bargain with now. 
 Everyone, make your shots count. 
 Burton, you protect those kids. 
 Stonebridge : We need your help. 
 Jesus. 
 [SHOUTS] 
 [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 [GASPS] 
 Bravo, be advised. The cavalry has arrived. 
 Get in. 
 [MAN SCREAMING] 
 Thank you, General Olusu. 
 [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 General Olusu sends his regards... and thanks Major Sinclair for his assistance. 
 Waabri's men killed many of our comrades. 
 Finally he has come to justice. 
 [BURTON GROANING] 
 Burton : Sulaimani. 
 They will live a long time... but it will not be I who buries them. 
 And I'm glad we met again, my old friend. 
 Shall I shroud you for your journey home? 
 I am home. 
 Knox : The cost of African history is too often exacted in human lives. 
 And it's the duty of people in my position... to channel the future towards something brighter. 
 I'm well aware of the criticism that's leveled at me. 
 Heh, heh. That I'm secretive and reclusive. 
 Huh? 
 Heh, heh. What else? Oh, yes. 
 I'm unscrupulous and ruthless. 
 Well, as a businessman, I take that as a compliment. 
 The other thing I hear quite a lot of is that I will deal with anyone... and in its work from Algeria to Zimbabwe... the Conrad Knox Foundation will deal with anyone... however unpopular they may be, in the cause of food aid... agricultural development, the decommissioning of arms. 
 I believe the deal can work where armies and politics have failed. 
 And the deal started on this continent. 
 Two tribesmen at a watering hole finding a common interest... and ensuring the very survival of our species. 
 In a world of aggression and violence, the deal is pure. 
 It's the only thing that is pure... and I truly believe that the deal is the only thing that will save Africa. 
 Scott : Ladies. 
 [SCOTT CHUCKLES] 
 They know how hot they look in those uniforms, don't they? 
 Of course, they do. And that's why they have women in the military... 
 -...so you can maintain your permanent hard-on. 
 I like when you do that. 
 What's that? 
 See things my way. 
 Time to face the music, mate. 
 You did nothing wrong, Mike. 
 Yeah. 
 It takes some pretty heavy sh1t for you to see reason, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 What about you? 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 The 20 is all I got. 
 Yeah. 
 And the, uh, CIA thing you failed to mention? 
 Yeah, I didn't mention it. 
 I'd appreciate it if you don't mention it again. 
 Damien. 
 Michael. 
 Have fun at school. 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 Ladies. 
 Thank you. 
 You showed some stones out there. 
 Save it. 
 You're a ball-buster, you know that? 
 Yup. And you're an arrogant, insubordinate prick. 
 Here. I got you a souvenir. 
 I've gotta know one thing. 
 Would you have let us all die for the sake of these? Huh? 
 I wouldn't have lost any sleep over you. 
 I know who Christy Bryant is, and I know what you did for the CIA. 
 Just how well do you sleep at night? 
 f*ck you. 
 I want those triggers. 
 You recovered nothing? 
 Dalton : That's what my report says. 
 As you proved on this mission... secrecy was always more important than success. 
 Well, I'm waiting. 
 I downloaded documents from the Libyan's laptop. 
 Dodgy export licenses... money trails leading back to known human-rights violators... nuclear hardware components originating from British factories. 
 I wouldn't want to find my name on there. 
 This was never about hostages. 
 Now, I am happy to give them to you if you give Section 20 a clean bill of health... because anyone seriously contemplating shutting down... a unit of soldiers this dedicated and this committed is a fucking-- 
 Captain, you are way out of li-- 
 Bennett : Enough. 
 Quite a testimonial for Section 20. 
 Dalton : Yes. 
 Well, don't let them know I said it. 
 What about you? 
 Dalton : Whoever has those triggers... I'm fairly sure they won't be using them as paperweights. 
 Axmali : Have you what was promised me? 
 I was bringing it to you. 
 Of course. 
 I have use for them. 
 You may try to cheat the white devils... but you cannot cheat Allah. 
 Beautiful. 
 [KNIFE PIERCING AND WOMAN SCREAMING] 
 Sinclair : I want to offer my thanks... for all your hard work and dedication during this difficult period. 
 These are trying times for a section like ours... and the discipline of each and every one of you... both in the field and in command... has been as I would expect, exemplary. 
 [WHISPERS] Baxter. 
 Sinclair : This hasn't gone unnoticed... 
 Nice work. 
 Sinclair : ...and as we will be engaging in more operational work... Command have decided, as of today, that, uh... 
 That Section 20 requires new leadership... following the death of Colonel Grant. 
 Some of you already know Captain Dalton-- 
 I'm sorry. Major Dalton. 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 You're sh1tting me. 
 Kerry : I was talking about you the other day. 
 Stonebridge : Really? 
 Yeah. 
 And it made me realize that... 
 Can we start again? 
 Kerry, of course we can. 
 I love you. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLING] 
 Kerry : Ah. 
 I don't know about you, but I would love an ice cream. 
 Oh, would you? 
 [GUNSHOT AND KERRY GRUNTS] 
 Kerry. Kerry. 
 Kerry! 
 Kerry!
