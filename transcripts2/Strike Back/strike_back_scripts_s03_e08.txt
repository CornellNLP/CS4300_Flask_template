 Sinclair : Walter Lutulu, leader of the party for a Democratic Zimbabwe. 
 Knox is a known supporter. 
 Walter Lutulu with nukes. 
 They will need outside help if they're gonna make a move on Zimbabwe. 
 We could be looking at the beginning of a coup. 
 Let's start with the CIA. 
 Christy Bryant : If the regime had killed Walter, the opposition planned to install his daughter as the front-runner. 
 There are clear guidelines about the treatment of prisoners. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Knox ordered this. 
 My father--Walter Lutulu! 
 [Cheering] 
 [Gunshot] 
 You were with Conrad Knox. 
 Did you see any nuclear weapons? 
 You have to help him! 
 I'm trying to do the best I can! 
 Stonebridge : This is the man responsible. 
 He shot Lutulu. 
 [Dog barks]

 Put the gun on the floor, nice and slowly. 
 Slowly. 
 Ok. 
 Now get up, slowly. 
 My name's Michael Stonebridge. 
 I'm a British Military attaché. 
 And I need your help. 
 You've got a funny way of asking for it. 
 Here. Take it. 
 You got some ID? 
 Nothing you'd believe. 
 But right now, that's the least of our worries. 
 [Men shouting] 
 Child : I saw him. 
 He's in there. 
 sh1t. That mob that's gathering outside-- 
 This is the man responsible. 
 He shot Lutulu. 
 I am a refugee. 
 This man has beaten and abused me. 
 Oi! 
 I demand you lock him up! 
 You want to go outside? 
 You want to go outside and take your chances? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 No? Then f*cking get in that cell. 
 Come here. 
 Get in the cell. 
 I should have let them tear your arms off and beat you to death. 
 Get in there. 
 [Door closes and locks] 
 Cheers. 
 What's your name? 
 Moses. 
 Moses? 
 Yeah. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 How many officers do you have here? 
 You're looking at it. 
 It's just a one-man operation. 
 Ok. 
 I need you to call for reinforcements, yeah? 
 If that mob gets in here, they're gonna lynch him, and us, too.

 Doctor : GSW to the mid-chest and shoulder. 
 Lilian : Father, look at me. 
 Doctor : Almost certain pneumothorax. 
 Shoulder through and through. 
 Tell surgical he'll need a central line, and get some blood up for an urgent cross-match for 6 units. 
 Is he going to be ok? 
 Did you see what he was shot with? 
 I think it was a 9 mm.

 Bullshit. 
 Lutulu? 
 He's a colonialist puppet. 
 He deserves to die, and whoever did it is a hero of Zimbabwe! 
 Papa, look at me. 
 Is he going to be ok? 
 Look, I'm not going to lie to you. 
 His wounds are serious, but whoever helped him out on the way here has given him a fighting chance. 
 Walter : I should have been stronger for you. 
 Lilian : Don't say this. 
 I'm sorry, but I've got to ask-- 
 Do you know the man that shot you? 
 Sir, you're gonna have to step back. 
 Look, I'm a journo.

 Mr. Lutulu, who was recently broken out of a high-security prison in Harare, was gunned down today at a pro-democracy rally in Bukhoma Township. 
 We'll have more later. 
 Much more. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Yup? 
 Man on TV : But in other news... 
 Major, it's Stonebridge. 
 Put him on speaker. 
 Bravo Two. 
 I haven't fully IDed the shooter, but he's ex-Zimbabwe Special Forces. 
 Dalton : Who sent him? 
 He isn't saying. 
 Whoever did, they set him up. 
 He was waiting for support that never arrived. 
 He's pro Mugabe, fanatical. 
 "Cui bono"? 
 Yeah. Who benefits? 
 The current regime. 
 They eliminate a rival, they get a free run at the next election. 
 Dalton : No. 
 It's too easy. 
 They control the electoral process anyway. 
 Too wily to pull something this public. 
 This assassination is gonna bring a firestorm down on their heads. 
 Where were Matlock's bodyguards when Lutulu made his speech? 
 No, there was no one there. 
 Scott and I would have noticed. 
 Knox breaks him out and then leaves him exposed. Why? 
 This was never about Walter Lutulu taking over Zimbabwe. 
 This is about Conrad Knox. 
 Man on TV : Following the assassination of Walter Lutulu, a wave of unrest amongst the displaced Zimbabwean community in South Africa is spreading north to the borders of Zimbabwe itself. 
 Whilst denying any responsibility for Mr. Lutulu's murder, a spokesman for the ruling Zanu-PF Party has squashed any talk of negotiating...

 We were there to apprehend him. 
 Why? 
 He's got ahold of some nuclear triggers for WMDs. 
 Conrad? 
 That's ridiculous. 
 It might sound like that to you, but... 
 I'm telling you the truth. 
 That was us that saved you outside your office.

 In Washington, the Secretary of State moved swiftly to condemn the attack. 
 She stopped short of calling for military intervention but supported calls for the ruling Zanu Party to step down.

 You've achieved more for Zimbabwe with one bullet than you will with those weapons.
