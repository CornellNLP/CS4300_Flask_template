 Previously on 
 Strike Back Last night, five EU officials were kidnapped by this man, Fatmir Hasani, the biggest heroin trafficker in the Balkans. 
 Your mission is to secure the release of the hostages. 
 You ever feel like you're not getting told the whole story? 
 Not everything's a conspiracy. 
 Howdy, folks. 
 I'm here to take you home. 
 Get in the f*cking jeep! 
 We are clear with the hostages. 
 Jesus, Scott, the whole camp was out looking for you. 
 Where the f*ck were you? 
 The US cavalry really exists! 
 Come on. 
 Let's move. 
 Put it down. 
 Now. 
 Piece of sh1t. 
 Sorry, pal. 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 You okay? 
 You remember where you are? 
 I'm with you. 
 Yeah. 
 (WHISPERS) Stay here. 
 Hey, wake up. 
 This the bit where you surprise me, tell me you know I'm MI6? 
 We have orders to execute you. 
 If we want to. 
 I want to. 
 What are you doing in Kosovo? 
 I was following a lead. 
 Last-minute tip-off. 
 The rest is...don't take this the wrong way but, you know, outside your skill-set. 
 Rumor has it, you're in Latif's rolodex. 
 I've been offering him cooperation in return for money. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Now you're just giving me a reason to kill you. 
 Try to keep up. 
 I've gained his trust, now I get to find out what he wants to know from me. 
 Then we'll know what he's planning. 
 You're telling me you're a double agent? 
 Who's counting? 
 I'll just kill you twice as hard. 
 You're Damien Scott. Delta Force? 
 Dope in your locker? 
 Dishonorable Discharge... 
 So you know who set me up, huh? 
 I bet you don't even know what Trojan Horse is. 
 Hey! Put him down, Scott. 
 And now, you never will. 
 Put him down! 
 f*ck! 
 Hasani wants to see you. 
 f*ck you. 
 Scott : I shoulda asked myself what you were doing turning up at a dope factory with an empty truck. 
 Donoghue : It's like I said, we're just here to keep the peace, not save the world. 
 And if we can make a little money on the side, then so be it. 
 You're a f*cking embarrassment to our country in that uniform! 
 Maybe, but tomorrow I'll still be alive. And f*cking rich. 
 I'll be seeing you, buddy. 
 No you won't. 
 Yeah, I will. 
 (BANGING POT) 
 Kennedy. 
 What? 
 You need to kill the old woman. 
 Why? 
 'Cause it's time you did something for your cut. 
 Take her out to the pit and make it quick. 
 Playtime's over! 
 Ah, Jesus... 
 Ma'am. You got to come with me. 
 Me? Where am I going? 
 With me, Ma'am. 
 Anyone hurts her, anyone at all, I will kill you. 
 Sure... 
 It's all right, Michael. 
 Please don't worry. 
 Thank you for everything. 
 Nice. 
 I have a question for you. 
 You bring my cousin here, and then you shoot him, endangering your own mission. 
 Why? 
 There's a good question... 
 You take the hostages and then you break off your escape to attack my refinery? 
 Oh, was that your place? 
 Sorry about that, huh? 
 You will die today, along with the others... 
 Except the blonde girl. She will live, unfortunately for her. 
 (SPEAKS IN ALBANIAN) 
 Move... 
 God be with you. 
 Hasani : You lay down for me? 
 What's that noise? 
 (FLIES BUZZING) 
 Oh dear God. 
 Dana, I'm gonna come get ya. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) 
 f*ck. 
 (GRUNTS)

 Original Air Date on October 7, 2011 
 ♪ 
 I still can't believe they killed her. Why would they kill her? 
 She's completely harmless. 
 What had she done? 
 It's just utterly... 
 Just, shut up! 
 Please. 
 Hey... Stay focused. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'm very focused. 
 I see. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) 
 Yeah. 
 That was the US base in Kosovo. 
 Donoghue just reported. 
 He said they came under fire, and had to abandon the rendezvous point. 
 There's no information on our men or any of the hostages. 
 Thank you. 
 Hasani is notoriously ruthless, even by Balkan standards. 
 I think we should assume by now they are both non-operational. 
 (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 Hasani! Mr. Hasani! 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Please. Please. 
 (SPEAKS IN ALBANIAN) 
 Mr. Hasani. 
 (STUTTERING) The man Allen. The one that went with the girls. He's a spy! 
 He's on some kind of secret mission. He's the one they came for, not us. 
 I think Allen may be of great value to you! 
 Thank you. 
 God... 
 (GROANING) 
 (HASANI IN ALBANIAN) 
 (SPRAYING NOISE) 
 What's that? 
 Refrigeration. They want to keep his body fresh. 
 Why? What for? 
 For Christ's sake, no, you can't be serious. 
 Kennedy : Hey! Hey! 
 Hey, wait up! Wait up! 
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 Hiya. Uh...little souvenir of your stay. 
 Ew, oh... 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (GAGGING) 
 Just breathe, yeah? 
 Did you hear the sound that made, when it hit the ground? 
 Yeah. 
 Unless this dude was a robot, pretty sure I heard metal. 
 (COUGHING) 
 Oh... Jackpot! 
 Yours... 
 "Old lady alive, 500 meters due East, Hasani's camp." 
 (LAUGHING) All right... 
 Yep. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is that wise? 
 I think so! 
 (GRUNTS) f*ck! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Get it off me! 
 Ahhh! Get it off! 
 Scott : Whoo! Shut up! 
 (LAUGHING) Whoo! 
 That's a bit of fun. 
 (COUGHING) 
 I love this country. 
 Think I'm gonna move here. 
 We need to get going. 
 Uh...copy that. 
 Take this. Go get Mrs. Heath, and bring her back here. 
 There's a bridge, about a kilometer down the road. 
 That way? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, I'll meet you at that bridge in one hour. 
 If I'm not there, you go on without me. Oy! 
 Branko, come here. 
 Mother fucker. 
 Hey, hey! 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Ask him where they took the girls. 
 (SPEAKS IN ALBANIAN) 
 Then I'm gonna come and kill Hasani! Hee, hee, hee. 
 (WHEEZING) 
 And you too! What's that in your pocket? 
 Cologne? You f*cking piece of sh1t. 
 You dying, huh? 
 (RUSTLING) 
 (GASPS) 
 Michael! 
 (WHISPERS) You're fine. 
 Oh! 
 Scott : About time, you two. 
 Where'd you get the guns? 
 Stonebridge : Well, done. 
 Our mysterious benefactor left them for us. 
 You're alive? You're alive. 
 That's good. That's good... 
 All right, everyone off the bridge, let's go. 
 What the hell happened to her? 
 Found her in the trees, next to some dead guards with these AK's stacked up for us. 
 Stonebridge : Get anything off the driver? 
 Scott : Yeah, his AK and a phone. 
 No signal on the phone. 
 Anything else? 
 Yeah, he told us where they took Allen and the girls. 
 Some old military base in the forest, a few hours south of here on foot. 
 The kid knows where it is. 
 That's Hasani's main place, everything goes through there, drugs, girls, weapons... 
 Company, Mike go! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Go, go! 
 (INDISTINCT YELLING) 
 f*ck me! 
 Michael, go forward. 
 Go forward! 
 f*ck, I'm out... 
 Move, move. I've got you covered, just go! 
 Michael, you give me those guns and you take the hostages. 
 Hey... Scott, I told you before. 
 My life is my call. Now get the hell out of here. Go! 
 Cover me! 
 God f*cking damn it! 
 Will Michael be okay? 
 Look, he had two choices back there. 
 One of those was to retreat. 
 He wouldn't have done that, would he? 
 I see. 
 I should write and thank his... Does he have a family? 
 Yeah... He does. 
 Manning : Excuse me, excuse me? 
 Is there a plan to get us out of here? 
 A man just gave his life to save yours. 
 You might at least acknowledge that. 
 Uh, plan is, we pick up Allen, Dana, Adrijana... 
 Then we head to the extraction point. All right? 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, you make it sound as if we're going out for... 
 Dinner. I mean, they'll be guarded, won't they? 
 I mean, wouldn't it make more sense to get home, and try and organize some sort of a rescue, I mean, a proper rescue? 
 I mean...obviously it's appalling, God knows, I don't know what's gonna happen to them... 
 (CRYING) But I... I'm covered in f*cking blood... 
 It's all over me... 
 I can't believe... 
 (GRUNTS) 
 You done? 
 Yeah. 
 You're a politician, right? 
 So, let's put it to a vote. 
 All those In favor? 
 Ain't democracy grand? 
 We keep moving. 
 They have all been kidnapped from their villages. 
 Do they know where they're going? 
 Of course. Everyone knows what happens to girls who are taken by Hasani. 
 They are raped, then addicted to heroin, then sold off to be slaves. 
 There has to be some kind of way out of this. 
 Kerry Stonebridge. 
 What? 
 She just bought a ticket at Heathrow Airport. 
 Where to? 
 Here. 
 (SIGHS) He told her he was in Vienna. 
 That's all we need. Right, go meet her at the airport. 
 Ow, oh. 
 What... 
 Sorry. 
 That's all right. 
 You okay? All right. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Nobody move! 
 What is it? 
 Why don't you stay where you are? 
 Mr. Scott? 
 Scott : f*ck me. 
 All right. Bad news is we're standing in a minefield. 
 The good news is we're almost out of it. All right? 
 We just gotta get to those trees. 
 Now, just do what I say. Trust me. 
 Trust you! You led us into a f*cking minefield! 
 And I'm gonna lead you out. 
 It's just gonna take a bit of time. 
 All right. I'm gonna go first. Ma'am, okay? 
 You follow, but leave at least three paces behind. 
 All right, you put your feet exactly where I put mine. 
 Understood. 
 Okay. 
 Branko. 
 What about me? 
 Branko, you fall in. 
 This is the safe line, behind Mrs Heath. 
 All right? You need to get over here, then you do the same. 
 Three paces between us, watch where you put your feet. 
 Okay? 
 I said, what about me? 
 Yeah, I heard you the first time. 
 Just stay calm, okay? 
 You need to stay on this same line. 
 Come to us. Watch where you put your feet. 
 We cool? Yeah? 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) 
 (YELLING) 
 Hold up... 
 It's okay. 
 I'm still alive, fuckhead! 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry, everyone okay? Good. 
 Uh-huh. 
 
 
 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Scott : (ON PHONE)   Colonel? 
 Scott? 
 Yeah. 
 Trace this number, now! 
 I'm on it. 
 Grant : (OVER PHONE) 
 What is your situation? 
 I'm in a minefield. I got three friendlies with me. 
 Where's Stonebridge? 
 He's MIA. 
 Please tell me you've got Allen? 
 Negative. 
 Where is he? 
 Look, I need to get the f*ck out of here! Okay? 
 We're getting a fix on you now. 
 Yeah. 
 (COMPUTER BEEPING) 
 The mines, most likely PMA-2's. 
 The usual spread is in grid formation, one every 10 square meters. 
 Copy that. 
 I'm putting you on speaker, in my pocket. 
 Everyone okay? 
 Um... 
 f*ck me. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Fucki... f*ck... 
 (CRYING) 
 (MUTTERING) 
 (BRANKO MUTTERING) 
 Scott :   Hey, hey, hey... 
 You're okay. You're okay. 
 'Kay? 
 Now, now... I... 
 I should go back. 
 No, Manning, no. 
 Yeah... I, I can retrace my steps. 
 Manning, Manning... 
 Please, just calm down. 
 Okay? Please, sh1t... 
 Oh, ahhh! 
 Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa... You all right? 
 You're okay, you're okay. 
 You're okay. 
 Off we go. 
 I can't stay here... 
 No, no, no, no! Branko! 
 f*ck me. 
 Or you can do it that way. 
 I rather prefer your method, thank you very much, Mr. Scott. 
 So do I. 
 Manning : (CRYING) I can't... I can't stay here... 
 Manning... 
 I can't stay here... (REPEATEDLY) I can't stay here... 
 Manning... 
 I can't stay... 
 (SCREAMING) 
 No, Manning! 
 Bloody hell, he's gonna do it! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (LINE GOES DEAD) 
 Scott? 
 Jesus Christ. 
 (MOANING) 
 Scott? Can you get this back? 
 Nothing. 
 Sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Colonel. We're out, Manning didn't make it. 
 Colonel? 
 f*ck. Battery's dead. 
 Come on. 
 (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (BANGING) 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) 
 (WHISTLING) 
 (BANGING) 
 They choose us now, for later. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Hi. 
 Mrs. Stonebridge, I'm Colonel Eleanor Grant. 
 May I come in? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 I, um... I'm sorry Michael's not here. 
 A job came up at the last minute. 
 That's how it goes... 
 Is Michael dead? 
 I beg your pardon? 
 He's missing presumed dead. 
 You can't confirm it but you want me to prepare myself. 
 Michael is a quite exceptional soldier. 
 I came out to tell him that he had to leave. 
 If we're having a baby then he'd have to leave Section 20. 
 I see. 
 I'd like to be alone now. 
 If you need anything, there'll be an officer in the lobby. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) 
 (YELLS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GASPING) 
 (WHISTLING) 
 Just in time, boys. 
 (YELLING) 
 (YELLING CONTINUES) 
 (WHISTLING) 
 (IN ALBANIAN) 
 Fatmir. 
 It is an honor, my friend. 
 It is of great pride to me that you should avail yourself of my various services. 
 You've done as I asked? 
 The weapon has been obtained and transported to Chechnya as you requested. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Ah, Mr. Allen. 
 So you  enjoyed our little kidnapping charade? 
 I needed to bring you here, in person, without making my intentions too obvious. 
 Have you got it? 
 Twenty million dollars in used notes and bearer bonds. 
 As requested. 
 You're wise to be cautious but perhaps while you check it, you can hand my associate your device... 
 So he can start the de-encryption process. 
 Scott : Stay out of sight, okay? 
 You bad boys love your bells and whistles, dot you? 
 You think I keep it on this? 
 I deserve a bit more credit than that. 
 So where is it? 
 In here. 
 You might want a pen and paper to write it down. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (LAUGHING) Yeah... 
 (YELLING) 
 (CHEERING) 
 (DEVICE BEEPS ON) 
 (CLAPPING) 
 (YELLING CONTINUES) 
 There you go. 
 Cheap at 20 million. 
 Even cheaper for nothing. 
 I can still be useful to you. 
 That, Mr. Allen, is a decision for me. 
 Get what you can from it. Then destroy it. 
 We can take your car to the clinic. 
 What do you got there, buddy? 
 Hey, hey, Allen, Allen... 
 Hey, can't die on me, yet. 
 How do you know all that sh1t about me? 
 What happened to me in Iraq? 
 That consignment of WMD... 
 You shouldn't have asked so many questions... 
 That sh1t is still out there. 
 He's going to use it. 
 Who are you talking about? Latif? 
 What the f*ck is Trojan Horse? What is that? 
 It's the gift that keeps on killing. 
 Mahmood, Bratton, Porter... 
 Yeah. 
 What about Porter? 
 Did you set him up? 
 Was that you? 
 No, that one's not on me. 
 Scout's honor. 
 Who was it? 
 Who the f*ck was it? f*ck. 
 Allen. Answer me. Allen. Allen. 
 f*ck. 
 (CHANTING) 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (CHEERING) 
 (WHISTLING) 
 (SCREAMING CONTINUES) 
 Shoosh. (REPEATEDLY) Hey, hey, hey... It's okay. 
 Hey. Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 How you doing? 
 You okay? 
 To be honest... 
 I'm f*cking angry. 
 That's good. 
 That's good. 
 Here, I got something for you. 
 You want to get even? 
 You press those buttons. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Give me that. You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Okay, Come on... 
 Donoghue. 
 Jesus. 
 Scott. Hey, man. 
 There's no hard feelings. 
 We're gonna sort this sh1t out, right? 
 Sure. 
 It's okay. 
 Kennedy : Scott! 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 Kennedy. Military Police. 
 I spent three months undercover, investigating that crooked asshole. 
 You get to shoot him, before I do. 
 Yeah. 
 You lucky b*st*rd. 
 Yeah, sorry about that. 
 I gotta get out of here. Man, I gotta bail. This is a clusterfuck with you guys and the goddamn CIA running around. 
 What are you talking about? CIA? 
 Yeah, they took the hit on Rama at the hostage handover. 
 He killed American soldiers, so Langley wanted him for their trophy room. 
 You know where they've got my friend? 
 Oh, jeez. Do you really want to know? 
 (DISTORTED VOICES) 
 So the income generated from the organ farm helps to cover the cost of my militia... 
 Ah, here is Doctor Mullova. 
 Doctor. Everything been satisfactory? 
 Quite satisfactory. 
 I'd like to thank you once again for the doctor's help in the training my people. 
 As promised, Mr. Hasani has made a more than adequate number of subjects available to me for research. 
 If you follow me, I will show you the results. 
 And you will be in a position to relocate with me today? 
 Absolutely. 
 There's been a massive explosion seven miles from the last known position. 
 Who else could it be? 
 So I wish you a safe journey and every success. 
 There is one matter, Fatmir. 
 Yes? 
 I do not remember agreeing that you should ransom the hostages. 
 Look, I had no intention of returning them. 
 I merely saw an opportunity to release my cousin and make the British look foolish. 
 In so doing, you drew the CIA here, British military. 
 You cost me my most useful asset and risked drawing attention to my presence... 
 It will not happen again. 
 You're right. 
 (IN ALBANIAN) 
 (ALARM RINGING) 
 Michael! You all right? 
 f*ck, f*ck... 
 Hey, it's me, it's me, Michael. 
 f*ck, Jesus... Come on, come on, buddy... 
 (GRUNTING) Oh yeah, yeah... 
 sh1t! It's a bit early for Halloween, champ. 
 Kennedy, grab him! 
 Kennedy : Yeah, I got him. 
 Drag him up. 
 Drag him up. 
 Michael! 
 Hi, there. 
 Kennedy : Scott! 
 What is it? 
 Roadblock! 
 f*ck! 
 (REPEATEDLY) Hey, hey, hey... 
 Off the bus, off the bus... 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 Don't do it, soldier! 
 Huh? Who are you? 
 Steady! 
 Zero one... 
 Zero one? 
 This is Kestrel 1. 
 We have the hostages and assorted civilians. 
 Immediate medical evacuation required. 
 (LAUGHS) Zero one, buddy. 
 Look at this, friends... 
 We're going home. 
 Yeah? It's all good. 
 You all right? 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Where's the blonde? 
 Haven't seen her... 
 Do you have any new conspiracy theories for me? 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Maybe some other time. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 You ever heard of anything called Trojan Horse? 
 What is it? A codename? 
 I dunno. 
 See you around. 
 I can try to find out for you. If that's what you want. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 It didn't feel right, going on my own. 
 We can't go on like this, Michael. 
 Hey... 
 John Allen. 
 Quite a piece of work. 
 Mmm... 
 So we're de-encrypting the PDA that Scott brought in? 
 Yeah, Sergeant Richmond's dealing with it. 
 The program's up and running. 
 Good, well, let's just hope it gives us a lead on Latif. 
 He and Allen had been in contact for years. 
 I think it's safe to assume that he gave John Porter up to Latif. 
 Thank you, Major. 
 Colonel. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 How'd you get in here? 
 I used all my Special Forces Training... 
 Don't you want me? 
 You have no idea... 
 The moment I met you... 
 All I wanted... 
 Was to not let you down. 
 You haven't let me down. 
 Well, then... 
 This is exactly how I want you to remember me. 
 You know what? 
 What? 
 You're pretty f*cking cool. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 You out here just in case I came by? 
 Yeah. 
 That's cute. 
 Shall we? 
 We shall.
