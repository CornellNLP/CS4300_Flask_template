 [Speaking Arabic] 
 You've reached Michael Stonebridge. 
 Leave a message. 
 I'll call you back. 
 [Car door closes] 
 Rosie, how's it going? 
 It's... Rachel. 
 It hasn't changed since we met. 
 What was it... two hours ago? 
 Yeah. 
 So, anything? 
 No. 
 I'm just... curious how on earth they allowed an American to... 
 To work for the Brits? 
 It's a long story. 
 But is it a good story? 
 No. Just long. 
 All right, mystery man. 
 Let's just say, you get a second chance, you take it. 
 I'll bear that in mind. 
 Yeah. 
 And finally. 
 I'm guessing that's him. 
 So he's a big deal, huh? 
 I doubt it, except to me. 
 Rachel : He's the first asset I've been given responsibility for since I came here, so getting him quickly and quietly to the high commission would make me look good. 
 You already look good to me, Rosie. 
 [Laughs] 
 Nice laugh. 
 I'm guessing that's a rental. 
 Mr. Keemal, this is Patrick Burton, deputy head of mission. 
 Thank you. 
 Would you like to check the laptop? 
 Well, forgive my cynicism, miss MacMillan, but babysitting a Libyan office clerk who wants a council house on the South Coast is hardly a baptism of fire for you. 
 [Starts engine] 
 Richmond : Bravo, we have visual on you. 
 Hey, is that my guardian angel looking down on me from above? 
 What are you wearing today? 
 Concentrate. 
 [Laughs] 
 Woman : Stop, please. 
 [People speaking foreign language] 
 [Car horn honking] 
 sh1t. 
 [People shouting] 
 Stay there! 
 He's down. 
 We need to get Scott out of there. 
 Get them out! 
 Stand back! 
 They're taking hostages. 
 [Shouting] 
 Man : Go, go, go, go, go! 
 [Sirens] 
 Get in! 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 I'm from the British consulate. Get in.

 Man : You're dead, Stonebridge. 
 You clear back there? 
 No. 
 Then why did you come in here? 
 Did you make that mistake in Helmand? 
 No. 
 Then don't do it here. 
 I am going to get all my men through this. 
 You understand? 
 That means you, Jake. 
 [Metal clangs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Take a seat. 
 Stonebridge... I know him. 
 Stood with him in the sandpit. 
 He'll get you through this. 
 Jake, you were born for the regiment, like me, like dad. 
 I know. 
 That's what I want. 
 I just... 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe we should take a break, you know. 
 Come back, try again. 
 Listen. You and me, people like us, we have to fight for everything... every last f*cking thing. 
 They want you to doubt yourself. 
 They want you to give in, but we won't let them. 
 We won't let them. 
 What are we? 
 Brothers and soldiers. 
 We're brothers and soldiers. 
 Listen. 
 I'll... I'll have a word with him, all right? 
 Don't worry about it, all right? 
 You just stay focused. 
 Yeah. 
 Good lad. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Huh. Craig Hanson. 
 Hey. There he is. 
 How are you? 
 Good. You? 
 I'm fine, thanks. 
 Excellent. 
 Michael Stonebridge, desk jockey. 
 Who'd have believed it? 
 Man of your talents on the circuit could be raking it in. 
 I'm happy here. 
 Of course. Loyalty was always your thing. 
 But the private sector... 
 I'm telling you, that's where it's at. 
 Is that what you tell Jake? 
 I don't tell him anything. 
 He's, uh... 
 He's making mistakes, Craig. 
 What, training exercises? 
 This is the regiment. 
 The bar's not being lowered on my watch. 
 So don't lower it, Michael. 
 Come on. He did 3 tours of Helmand, went toe to toe with Terry Taliban every f*cking day, and he's seen Christ knows how many of his mates get crated back home. 
 He's a rock, just like you and me. 
 Just... just get him through it, all right? 
 Whatever it takes. 
 I had your back once, Michael. 
 Basra. 
 Kandahar. 
 You remember. 
 Yeah, of course I do. 
 I'll bet you must miss it, in the field? 
 Who wouldn't? 
 Good to see you. 
 What the hell am I doing here? 
 Use your head. 
 We're not gonna be able to respond if you're in a Kenyan police station for the next 48 hours. 
 Come on, Sinclair. We can't let this sh1t stand. 
 Do you think I want a cock-up like this on Section 20's record? 
 At this moment, I'm working on it. 
 Colonel Bennett. 
 Colonel Hodge. 
 Come on! Come on! 
 [Men shouting in foreign language] 
 Hey, hey. Hey! 
 Abdulabri Keemal, born Tripoli in 1953. 
 He's offering information about Libyan weapons stocks in return for asylum. 
 But he's not the reason that the convoy was hit. 
 Patrick Burton, East Africa specialist. 
 He's been working in the region for over 30 years. 
 Today was his last day on the job before being sent home. 
 [Metal clicking] 
 Huh? 
 What do we know about the female? 
 Her name's Rachel. 
 Who's this? 
 It's Damien Scott, sir. 
 This kidnapping happened right under your nose? 
 Unfortunately, yes. You give me the word, and I'll get those people back. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Rachel MacMillan, junior attache at the high commission. 
 She only took up her post this week. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Sinclair : All 3 are being held prisoner in a rebel-held area of Mogadishu, Somalia. 
 Now, a ransom has been demanded for the britons from this man... 
 Huseyin Waabri. 
 Richmond : He came to Europe from a refugee camp when he was 16, drifted around until he was implicated in the murder of a Somali community leader in northwest London. 
 Proposal? 
 An extraction mission is possible but highly dangerous. 
 Mr. Scott, are you ready to go in now? 
 Yes, I am, sir. 
 Without backup it's a suicide mission. 
 Your priority is recovery of the British citizens and all material relating to the Libyan. 
 Oh, and, Mr. Scott, you're the first man we're sending in, and it goes without saying you shall also be the last. 
 Copy that. 
 I want you to find out everything you can about the Libyan. 
 We need to know exactly what it is they're not telling us. 
 I think you have a lot of faith. 
 One man, however good? 
 We can't afford to make this look much bigger. 
 If they pull it off. 
 If they don't, you can bury Section 20 once and for all. 
 I'm sorry you got caught up in this, miss MacMillan. 
 It goes with the territory. 
 Huh. Broken people. 
 Brutalized beyond our understanding. 
 Such a tragedy. 
 You know, the first time I came to Somalia, I made a friend. 
 He knew what was coming for this country. 
 He could see the full horror of it... poverty, famine, civil war. 
 But he said, "however bad it gets", "on darkest day... 
 "Maalin nooga madoow... 
 The embers of hope still glow in our children's hearts." 
 I should have been there. 
 I could have used some help, but that ain't your problem. 
 Would have been fun to have you there. 
 There's a big difference between you and me, and that's Kerry. 
 Say hi to her for me. 
 Got to go. 
 Scott, you take care, mate. 
 I found you an apostle, someone who can get you in. 
 We can leave in an hour. 
 You mean we got a whole hour? 
 ♪ 
 [Speaking Arabic] 
 Salaamu alaikum. 
 [Speaking Arabic] 
 May your enterprises continue to flourish, and I look forward to the day you join us again in worship. 
 Everything changes in a man except the beat of his heart, and Allah once flourished in that heartbeat. 
 [Praying in Arabic] 
 You keep paying homage to Al-Shabaab and he will one day destroy you. 
 You do not understand. 
 I have requested a fee for your safe return. 
 She's my colleague. 
 I demand her proper treatment, as islam decrees. 
 Fradlam hushma. 
 You are not scared. 
 That is good. 
 And what about you, arab? 
 What value do you have? 
 Who will pay for your release? 
 A foreign corpse always does wonders for the morale of my people. 
 Maxamed! 
 Kill. 
 No. You want to be a soldier, kill him! 
 Burton : For God's sake! 
 He's just a child. 
 This is Somalia. 
 Childhood is short. 
 Now kill him. 
 No. Listen to me. 
 Kill him now! 
 Listen to me! No, no, no, no! 
 No, please. Wait! 
 I have a proposition for you. 
 It will be greatly to your advantage. 
 Somewhere a little more private? 
 Kalay. 
 [Speaks foreign language] 
 He wants to know if you've been there before. 
 To Somalia? No. 
 But I was trained by some guys who were. 
 Then you, of all people, should know what to expect. 
 I do. 
 Good. 
 Come. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 Uh, two seconds. 
 Am I gonna get to see you again? 
 Not if you're going into Mogadishu single-handed. 
 Don't you know a sympathy f*ck when you've had one? 
 I do now. 
 Good luck. 
 You have boats. 
 You could intercept. 
 It's a very special item, extremely valuable. 
 I exchange it with you for my freedom. 
 And the other hostages? 
 I do not interfere in another man's business. 
 Major. 
 Come. 
 20, I'm here. 
 Sinclair : I want you to move into Waabri's sector. 
 We're gathering intel on the Libyan. 
 He may be the key to locating the hostages. 
 Waabri's forces are just up ahead. 
 Whilst he lives, African union soldiers are powerless to control the area. 
 What are you getting out of this? 
 There is always business for me here. 
 Scott : Yeah? What business is that? 
 I bury the dead... shroud them for their journey home. 
 [Men shouting] 
 You see that is the price for crossing Waabri. 
 You got a shroud for Waabri? 
 I have a shroud for everyone. 
 Good. 
 His real name is Tafiq Elgabhri. 
 Reclusive Gaddafi insider. 
 Knows where all the bodies are buried. 
 Kenyan secret service has had him flagged as being in country for the last two weeks. 
 We hacked into their surveillance records. 
 This is him at a shipping office in Mombasa yesterday morning. 
 He used forged I.D's to confirm a shipment heading down to Southern Mozambique on a boat called "Morning Star." 
 Anything else? 
 "Morning Star" was hijacked by Somali pirates. 
 Satellite has it heading towards Mogadishu. 
 Eta : About now. 
 I want eyes on that boat and anyone that comes into contact with it. 
 Sure. 
 Soldier : Move it! 
 Everybody move! 
 Let's go! 
 [Thunder] 
 A reminder that tonight you'll be employing live rounds. 
 As an elite soldier, you will be operating in uncontrolled environments where you have a split second to distinguish an innocent from a hostile. 
 [Shouting and gunfire] 
 [No audio] 
 One mistake, and you have a scar on your conscience forever. 
 Or you're dead. 
 Questions? 
 No, sarge! 
 Then stack up! 
 [Metal clangs] 
 Hanson, what are you doing? 
 [Men shouting in distance] 
 Man : Hanson, get out! 
 [Man shouting in distance] 
 Come on, Hanson. 
 [Men shouting in distance] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Hanson! 
 Come back to the front! 
 Let's go! 
 That's an order! 
 [Men shouting] 
 One down! 
 Stonebridge : sh1t! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Aaah!

 ♪ 
 Major, I have a CCTV feed from the docks. 
 Keemal. He's unloading something. 
 Do not lose those vehicles at any cost. 
 Stonebridge : Jake! 
 They just called and told me. 
 Are you ok? 
 No, I'm not ok. I'm not ok with any of it. 
 Scott, we're tracking Keemal. 
 He's reentering Waabri's zone. 
 Scott : Copy that. 
 Sinclair : We are your eyes. 
 Follow our directions to intercept. 
 [Man grunts] 
 Richmond : Target approaching. 
 Man : On my mark. 
 No. 
 Be careful. 
 I see Waabri and the Libyan. 
 They're making some kind of trade. 
 You can name your price. 
 You keep your word, yes? 
 When do I get the buyer's identity? 
 Man : Now. 
 Waabri : f*ck! 
 f*ck. 
 Nice shot. 
 [Men shouting] 
 Scott, report. 
 Scott : We got a sniper. 
 sh1t. f*ck me. 
 [Men shouting] 
 Zero. The Libyan was taken out. 
 By who? 
 Don't know, but it was a f*cking good shot. 
 [Men shouting] 
 Scott : sh1t. 
 [Men speaking foreign language] 
 Scott : Hey. 
 Back off! 
 Back off! 
 Bravo, they mustn't find out you're military. 
 Lose comms. 
 Lose comms now. 
 Scott : f*cking sh1t. f*ck! 
 Go on.

 Ok, ok, ok, ok. 
 Ok, ok, ok, ok. 
 Putting it down. 
 It's down. It's down. 
 It's down! 
 Uh! 
 [Shouts in foreign language] 
 He's alive. 
 Major. 
 Major. 
 You heard what the general said. 
 He's the last man in. 
 Section 20... 
 There's nothing else that we can do. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Hello. 
 Who sent you? 
 Good question. 
 I'm gonna kick my travel agent's ass. 
 You try to steal the case from me? 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Who sent you?! 
 I refer you to my last answer. 
 Maya. 
 People say that Mogadishu is a dangerous place. 
 But it's funny. 
 It was London where I learned how to look after myself. 
 You know Harlesden? 
 No. 
 That is a scary place. 
 I joined a gym, was officially a "promising lightweight" before I had to leave. 
 When I used to work the bag, it was as if the world shrank away. 
 Movement, rhythm... 
 Timing. 
 A higher state. 
 You know Muhammad Ali? 
 Yeah. 
 Mmm. Interesting that your greatest ever boxer was a convert to islam. 
 It's his business, I guess. 
 Me... I like to keep my hand in. 
 Uh! 
 Uh! 
 Michael? 
 I have to go. 
 You can't be serious. 
 There's the coroner's hearing tomorrow and the inquiry. 
 It's Damien. 
 He's in trouble. 
 Damien will always be in trouble. 
 Just let me do this one thing. 
 Then I'll be home. 
 Home? This isn't our home. 
 You haven't even unpacked half your stuff. 
 There are still boxes in the nursery. 
 If there was a baby in there, would you still leave? 
 Or maybe you're relieved I had a miscarriage. 
 Oh, God. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Scott groaning] 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What the hell did they do to you? 
 Rachel. 
 I remembered this time. 
 Water and a cloth, please! 
 [Speaks foreign language] 
 You should have seen the other guy. 
 Not a mark on him. 
 [Speaks foreign language] 
 Was this an attempt to rescue us? 
 Yeah. Gave it a shot. 
 That was bloody stupid. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 Yes, sir. 
 The second... 
 Send me in. 
 Come on, Major. 
 Send me in. 
 Send me in. 
 Michael, you're out of your depth. 
 Major, you know as well as I do we can't leave him in there. 
 But I can't let you go in there alone. 
 He won't be alone. 
 I'll go with him. 
 Ok. Just as long as you understand. 
 This is a roll of the dice, at best. 
 Succeed or fail... each one of us is putting our careers on the line. 
 Roger that. 
 ♪ 
 So, uh, your Libyan friend. 
 What about him? 
 He's dead, huh. 
 He was shot at long range just after he handed a case off to that son of a bitch. 
 A silver case? 
 Square? 
 How did you know that? 
 I saw him carry it in. 
 Right. 
 Well, whatever was in that case had Waabri pretty excited. 
 ♪ 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Sir, in the last few seconds, there was a call to the dead Libyan's mobile. 
 We have a bead on the exact location. 
 It's less than half a click. 
 Who is this? 
 Mr. Waabri, I'd like to discuss the case you have in your possession. 
 Maybe we can meet in person. 
 Why should I trust you? 
 You don't have to trust me. 
 You just have to do business with me. 
 Where? 
 Cement factory, east side. 
 You brought the Libyan's phone here. 
 I told you to destroy every phone. 
 Now... 
 I can be found. 
 We must move. 
 Move them.

 Move. 
 [Guards speaking foreign language] 
 Move. 
 Stonebridge : Zero, we're in position. 
 Sinclair : We have you. 
 Enter building, northeast corner.

 Zero, we have visual. 
 They're on the move. 
 Sinclair : We have one shot at this. 
 Make it cold and quick. 
 Is there any other way? 
 All right. 
 Move. 
 TV : It's the thieves' treasure hideout. 
 Soon the 40 thieves return from within the... 
 Leaving nothing to reveal the hidden...

 I've definitely saved you more times than you've saved me. 
 Bullshit. 
 Hold still. 
 I was way ahead of you. 
 Looked like it. 
 You shouldn't be here, Michael. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Burton : Boys. 
 Kalay, kalay. 
 Hey! Put the gun down. 
 No, no, no. 
 We should help them!

 However... 
 I accept you received them in good faith. 
 As such, I am prepared to offer you an appropriate sum to obtain the case. 
 Why should I... believe you? 
 Mr. Waabri, this is the young lady... who took the shot you witnessed. 
 1/2 millimeter adjustment of her rifle scope, and right now it would be your brains being eaten off the floor by rats. 
 The Libyan had it coming.

 Negative. I have command on the ground.

 Because this is a classified mission. 
 You don't get to ask. 
 Look, if Waabri is trying to sell them on, do you have any idea what possession of those triggers could mean in the wrong hands? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 When you get the money, we will be free of this. 
 A new life together. 
 A new life. 
 Away from here. 
 Yes. 
 Promise to take me with you. 
 All right, Scott, Richmond can take Burton and the boys to the safe house. 
 They'll sit tight. 
 We can go after the triggers, and everyone will meet up at the chopper RV. 
 I think you're out of your f*cking mind. 
 Will you babysit the kids, then? 
 I'm not babysitting the kids. 
 Besides that fact, you're too rusty to do this sh1t on your own. 
 On my worst day... 
 In your dreams, buddy. 
 For Christ's sake. Cut the Laurel and Hardy routine. 
 Laurel and Hardy? 
 You know what she means by that? 
 Scott : What? 
 Stonebridge : She thinks you're fat. 
 Scott : Shut up. 
 Rachel : The safe house will give you cover until it's time for the evac. 
 You're in good hands with sergeant Richmond. 
 All right. 
 I'll see you on the other side. 
 Ok? 
 Go. 
 Scott : Hold there. 
 Stonebridge : Gentleman's persuader. 
 Burton : Ok. 
 Scott : Big man, that's for you. 
 All right, go. 
 Come on, boys. Go, go, go, quickly. Quickly. 
 We good? 
 Stonebridge : Clear. 
 Move out.

 Hello? 
 I'm looking for Michael Stonebridge. 
 Rachel : How far to the hand-over point? 
 Half a click. 
 Think she's done this before? 
 Yeah, it looks like it, buddy. 
 If only your recruits could see you now, Michael. 
 What do they say? Those that can't do, teach? 
 f*ck off. 
 What's up with you? 
 Mike? 
 What happened to your brother... his name was Jake. 
 It was... The training can be mentally very... 
 He was a fine soldier. 
 Of course. 
 Losing someone like this must be... I can't... 
 But you know Michael. 
 You know that he's a good man. 
 He's very lucky to have you. 
 Stonebridge : I had no choice, Scott. 
 I had to take him out. 
 So how did you not see that coming? 
 I don't know. 
 I did, but... 
 How did it get that far? 
 Sinclair know about this?

 Baxter : Good news. 
 The chopper is only 90 minutes away. 
 Richmond : Roger that. 
 Burton : You call this a safe house? 
 Richmond : Don't worry. 
 We will get you home. 
 You mean Britain? 
 I sacrificed a marriage and God knows how many promotions so that I could stay here in Africa. 
 Then some prick in Whitehall decides that it's too expensive to keep me on. 
 I've got more in common with these boys than I have with anyone back home. 
 Oh, I'm sorry.

 Waabri put guns in these children's hands, but... 
 They decided to come with us. 
 You won't bury them today. 
 Listen. 
 I have watched over you, but this is the toughest part of the city. 
 Richmond : Come on. 
 God knows how we're going to get there unseen.

 Set the device and find your position.

 Shut up, Sinclair. 
 I'm working on it.

 Zero, in position. 
 Sinclair : Copy that. 
 Scott : Here comes the money man now. 
 That's the full amount in untraceable bonds. 
 You're a rich man. 
 All right. 
 You got the guy coming down the stairs with the case? 
 Sinclair : Copy that.

 Now. Hit it now!

 Affirmative, Captain. 
 Bird is in the air. Agreed location in 10 minutes.

 Baxter : Bravo, secure a defensive position. 
 Scott : f*ck. 
 All right, move, move. 
 Far corner. 
 Far corner there. 
 Stonebridge : Far corner. Zero? 
 Zero, come in. 
 We have hostiles approaching. 
 We're short on ammo and we have no way out. 
 We'd love to hear a plan, yeah? 
 Baxter : We've got your position, bravo. 
 We need you to hold. 
 We got a lot of hostiles out here, Michael. 
 Baxter, where's our f*cking exfil?! 
 Hold positions. 
 Finding an exit. 
 [Crash] 
 Ugh. 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 Bravo, be aware. 
 The hostiles approaching from your east appear heavily armed. 
 No sh1t. 
 Scott : Michael, what did you find? 
 I found some ammo. 
 There's no way out. 
 We need to hold this position. 
 We're in a kill zone. 
 Down. Get down. 
 Scott : You got something for me? 
 Ma'am? 
 Thanks. 
 I need one, too. 
 Burton.

 f*ck me! 
 Zero, whose is that bird? 
 sh1t. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Baxter : Bravo, chopper is not friendly. 
 This is not an exfil. 
 Scott : Get down! 
 Down! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Scott : Whatever they're doing, they're doing a good job of scaring off the locals. 
 Sinclair : Bravo, repeat. 
 This is not exfil. 
 Treat as hostile. 
 Treat as hostile. 
 Scott : Yeah! 
 Buddy, I need you to back me up on this! 
 What? 
 Just follow my lead. 
 You know what I want! 
 Give me the case. 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 Give me the f*cking case, lady. 
 I will have your head on a plate! 
 That's gonna look very f*cking stupid. 
 Stand still and show me your f*cking hands! 
 You want this, you give me him! 
 That's a smart move. 
 Any chance is better than none, huh? You! 
 Good luck. 
 Like you give a sh1t. 
 You know what? 
 Come here. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 Waabri : Allah has taken your weapons. 
 You came here for nothing. 
 f*ck! 
 Matlock : sh1t! 
 Scott : That plan went to sh1t. 
 Stonebridge : What? 
 He took out Waabri. We've got nothing to bargain with now.

 Knox : The cost of African history is too often exacted in human lives... 
 And it's the duty of people in my position to channel the future towards something brighter. 
 I'm well aware of the criticism that's leveled at me. 
 That I'm secretive... 
 And reclusive, huh? 
 [Laughs] 
 What else? 
 Oh, yes. I'm unscrupulous and ruthless. 
 Well, as a businessman, I take that as a compliment. 
 The other thing that I hear quite a lot of is that I will deal with anyone, and in its work from Algeria to Zimbabwe, the Conrad Knox foundation will deal with anyone, however unpopular they may be, in the cause of food aid, agricultural development, the decommissioning of arms. 
 I believe the deal can work where armies and politics have failed. 
 And the deal started on this continent... two tribesmen at a watering hole finding a common interest and ensuring the very survival of our species. 
 In a world of aggression and violence, the deal is pure. 
 It's the only thing that is pure, and I truly believe that the deal is the only thing that will save Africa. 
 Ladies. 
 They know how hot they look in those uniforms, don't they? 
 Huh? 
 Of course they do. And that's why they have women in the military... so you can maintain your permanent hard-on.

 What's that? 
 See things my way. 
 Time to face the music, mate.

 [Horse neighs] 
 I want those triggers. 
 You recovered nothing? 
 Rachel : That's what my report says. 
 As you proved on this mission, secrecy was always more important than success. 
 Well, I'm waiting. 
 I downloaded documents from the Libyan's laptop... dodgy export licenses, money trails leading back to known human rights violators, nuclear hardware components originating from British factories. 
 I wouldn't want to find my name on that. 
 This was never about hostages. 
 Now I am happy to give them to you if you give Section 20 a clean bill of health because anyone seriously contemplating shutting down a unit of soldiers this dedicated and this committed is a f*cking... 
 Captain, you are way out of li... 
 Enough. 
 Quite a testimonial for Section 20.
