 It's El Soldat in person. 
 We have your brother. 
 You release the triggers, and I'll let you have your family reunion. 
 You slept with Othmani to get to El Soldat. 
 [Dalton speaks Arabic] 
 Othmani : I remember the taste of your skin. 
 Who you f*ck in the line of duty is your business, but if you're carrying baggage that could impact your leadership, that is my business. 
 The triggers. 
 We've got him. 
 Ex-legionnaire Karl Matlock. 
 That's him. 
 Matlock : Here. 
 Imagine what I can do with these. 
 Scott : You only came back to 20 because you thought it would be easier to track down Hanson, huh? 
 Don't blame you. 
 If I was you, I'd probably do the same thing.

 Where is your boy? 
 They're going to take us on an adventure, Harry. 
 Where's daddy? 
 He's coming with us, ok? 
 It's going to be fun. 
 I have to get some medication that he needs.

 Stay here. 
 Don't move. 
 What's happened? 
 He had a knife. 
 David! 
 Matlock : Don't bring the boy down here.

 Dalton : David Lombard-- killed at his home here in Cape Town last night. 
 Wife and son were abducted. 
 Scott : What's that got to do with us? 
 Isn't that a police matter? 
 Sinclair : Police have just issued this picture, salvaged from the disabled security camera. 
 Stonebridge : Ha. 
 That's Matlock's sniper. 
 Sinclair : Matlock used his false ID yesterday to hire an SUV. 
 We got a fix on it this morning. 
 It was heading out towards the airport. 
 We think he's going to meet this man-- 
 Peter Evans, the abducted woman's father. 
 We have to get to him first, find out what the hell Matlock's up to. 
 ♪ 
 [Beep] 
 Woman on PA : Please take care of your personal belongings, and do not leave any of your luggage... 
 ♪ 
 Stonebridge : Evans' plane just arrived. 
 Do you have eyes on Matlock? 
 Scott : Yeah. 
 He's got some new playmates. 
 One of them I know-- a guy named Curtis Roe. 
 Ex Delta boy. 
 He was a good soldier. 
 ♪ 
 Have we found out why Evans is so important yet? 
 Richmond : We're still looking into it. 
 British citizen, retired academic, divorced, pension. 
 Dalton : Hello. 
 Dalton : Dig deeper. 
 There has to be something else. 
 Mr. Evans, Rachel Dalton, British Military Intelligence. 
 Would you mind coming with us, please, sir? 
 Peter : Why? What is it? 
 What's wrong? 
 Dalton : It's just a routine check. 
 This way, please. 
 Where the hell is he? 
 Stay here. 
 I've told you, I'm here on holiday to see my daughter and grandson. 
 They live in Cape Town. 
 Dalton : And yet you only purchased your ticket yesterday at the airport--one-way. 
 Are you planning on staying? 
 I don't see that's any of your business. 
 What is this? 
 Dalton : Your daughter and your grandson have been abducted, her husband killed, but you knew this already. 
 No. No, I-- and the men waiting in arrivals are private military contractors led by a man called Karl Matlock. 
 I presume he's the man who contacted you. 
 I need to know exactly when and where he exits. 
 You understand? 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 I was expecting my daughter to meet me. 
 Then why didn't you put her address on your landing card, instead of a hotel where you don't have a reservation? 
 Mr. Evans, if you're the reason your family was kidnapped, we need to know why. 
 What do they want? 
 I haven't broken any law. 
 Make them release me. 
 Unfortunately, Mr. Evans, our South African colleagues here share our concerns. 
 Stonebridge : And this isn't just about your safety-- that of your family's. 
 Dalton : Leaving now. 
 Exfil point two. 
 Copy that. 
 This is outrageous. 
 I've done nothing wrong. 
 Thanks for your help, buddy. 
 Really appreciate it. 
 Woman : Hold that door. 
 You're going in there? 
 I'm going to see my boyfriend. 
 [Laughs] 
 Stonebridge : Bravo Two, we're bringing the package down. 
 I'll be at loading area 5 by the service elevators. 
 Scott : Copy that. 
 Matlock : Service elevator 3-- where does it come out? 
 Loading area 5, bottom level. 
 Matlock : Move! 
 [Clears throat] 
 At the end of the corridor, turn left. 
 And hurry up. They're heading towards the loading bays. 
 [Beep] 
 I want a lawyer. 
 Answer my questions, and then you'll get one. 
 Stand back! 
 What do you-- 
 Stonebridge : Contact! Exfil point! 
 Guys, I might have some company of my own.

 Dalton : Clearly you're not just a retired schoolteacher. 
 Talk to me. 
 Why is it that people want you dead? 
 You can't help my family. 
 You can't do anything. 
 Just let me go. 
 Zero, we're on the move from the airport. 
 Is the safe house ready? 
 Yes, but we can't hold him long. 
 That shoot-out has cost us South African support. 
 They want him released for questioning. 
 Dalton : I'll decide when we let him go. 
 Sinclair : We've dug further. 
 Turns out Evans is South African born. 
 He applied for UK citizenship 20 years ago, but here's the weird thing. 
 There's no record of his early life in Johannesburg-- no medical, no employment. 
 It's like he didn't even exist. 
 Michael. 
 Stonebridge : Yeah. 
 We've got a hostile coming up on our 6. 
 Scott : Drop! 
 Stonebridge : Keep him down!

 Who the f*ck is that? 
 ♪ 
 [Tires screeching] 
 [Tires screeching] 
 Mr. Dreyer, the minister's concerns are duly noted, but nobody is detaining Mr. Evans illegally. 
 Sinclair : He is a British subject who has specifically asked for our protection. 
 We cannot condone gunfights at our airports or on our open roads. 
 You've already caused the death of an immigration officer. 
 Dalton : Which we deeply regret, but Mr. Evans has vital information pertaining to our ongoing investigation. 
 Dreyer : His abducted family is a matter for the police. 
 Your investigation is into missing nuclear hardware. 
 Dreyer : How is Mr. Evans relevant? 
 Well, it would be premature to-- 
 Dreyer : It is a condition of your presence here that you keep me personally informed of all developments made in this investigation. 
 Grant my request and release Mr. Evans immediately, before the courts force you to do so. 
 Dalton : Well, that's the puppet. 
 Who's pulling the strings? 
 If you want to achieve something, you'll find a way. 
 If you don't, you'll find an excuse. 
 And we're all utterly sick of hearing these excuses from politicians and big business about how they cannot tackle poverty and disease or feed their people, and we say, "Enough, because there is a way." 
 What do you think? 
 Excellent. 
 Really excellent. 
 Very good. 
 That'll be our sound bite for the Kampala conference: Find a way, not an excuse. 
 It'll also give us a rod to beat our opponents with if they start blocking our aims. 
 Hmm. You should have stayed in Jo'burg. 
 Foundation HQ needs at least one of us to be there, present. 
 Well, then you take a turn. 
 I need to be here now, overseeing the weapons decommissioning program. 
 I'll lead with Rwanda. 
 It'll have more impact. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Don't worry, dad. 
 Even with this triumph, my moral authority will never match yours.

 ♪ 
 John Devers. 
 Special delivery. 
 How did you get in? 
 All deliveries are left at the gate. 
 ♪ 
 Dalton : His name is John Devers, a pediatrician in Stellenbosch-- killed earlier today. 
 Sinclair : And like Evans, Devers' records stop 20 years ago. 
 This is what he was reading on his laptop right before he was shot. 
 Scott : What kind of pediatrician is interested in nuclear fission? 
 The kind who used to be a scientist when South Africa became a nuclear power in the 1980s. 
 Dalton : When the Apartheid regime collapsed, so did their nuclear program. 
 A lot of the scientists received death threats and emigrated, changed their identities. 
 Bottom line: If Matlock does have the triggers here, who better to help him utilize them than a pair of ex nuclear scientists? 
 Yeah, which is why he'd want Evans. 
 Stonebridge : This wasn't some robbery gone wrong. 
 This was a professional hit done by people who knew John's real name, just like they know yours. 
 I'm Peter Evans. 
 I'm a retired teacher. 
 The men chasing us on that motorbike were holding a magnetic charge. 
 It was identical to the one Mossad used to kill an Iranian nuclear scientist-- Ahmadi Roshan. 
 Dalton : You are very aware that Israel helped South Africa set up their nuclear program. 
 They know the scientists involved, and they've been watching you ever since, making sure that you don't use your talents against them. 
 I've done nothing wrong. 
 Not yet. 
 But the PMCs who have kidnapped your family are in possession of stolen nuclear triggers, and there is no way in hell I'm going to let your knowledge fall into their hands. 
 So if, for whatever reason, I am forced to let you go, I will make sure that Mossad finds you way before Matlock does. 
 If you'd said Devers was important, I could have protected him. 
 Yes, I should have anticipated that, but I assumed that after 30 years, his anonymity was safeguard enough. 
 If Section 20 know Evans' true identity, then why the hell would they release him? 
 They won't, so you have to get him back. 
 ♪ 
 My real name is Peter Van Der Mayes. 
 John's was Johan Kluge. 
 We were the senior team leaders overseeing the nuclear program. 
 Extraordinary what we achieved, despite sanctions and with the world against us-- 
 You're proud of it? 
 Not as much as John was. 
 No Apartheid guilt with him. 
 No, just a bitterness that our work was destroyed, along with our careers and nearly our lives. 
 The government had to give all of us new identities. 
 So how did Matlock know yours, then? 
 Joseph Dreyer-- cabinet level civil servant. 
 Whoever has bought Matlock has him in their pocket, too. 
 I don't know Dreyer. 
 John was my contact. 
 He began telephoning me every day, asking me to come and join him, saying our work could be revived and this time used properly. 
 Used by who? 
 I didn't ask. 
 I didn't want to know. 
 I kept turning John down, until they took my family and forced me here. 
 What else are you hiding? 
 Free my family first. 
 Then I'll help. 
 Look, I know Curtis will help us, all right? 
 I mean, the guy won a purple heart. 
 I can't believe that he's even teamed up with Matlock. 
 Really? You don't think the money was an incentive? 
 No, not to Curtis. 
 And besides, he owes me. 
 I've saved his ass more times than I've saved Michael's. 
 Funny. 
 Yeah. 
 And so how exactly are you planning on making contact with him? 
 Don't worry about that. 
 I got an idea. 
 Scott : Mike. Mike. 
 ♪ 
 Stonebridge : The way you were banging on about this guy, I thought we'd be meeting him in a church. 
 Yeah, it's sort of like a holy place for Curtis. 
 Anyway, you can't knock a man's faith, Michael. 
 I'm not knocking his faith. 
 It's yours I'm wondering about. 
 This is the fifth one we've been to. 
 And that's him. 
 Huh. 
 See? You should have more faith in me. 
 That would take a miracle. 
 Yeah. 
 Ladies. 
 Classy, bud, real classy. 
 I can't believe you're paying for that.

 f*ck you. You got your free pass at the airport. 
 Don't go begging for more favors, because from where I'm standing... 
 Ha! 
 Now you owe me one. 
 Oh, you like hiding behind hostages.

 Scott : Come on. 
 Come on, guys. 
 You want some of this? 
 Step right up. Step right up! 
 Scott : Whoa! 
 Let's just play nice, huh? 
 All right. What are you dancing with those guys for? 
 You want to negotiate? 
 Show me the money. 
 Yeah, easy. 
 Twice what Matlock's paying you, and you get to keep it on top. 
 Make it triple. 
 Come on, Curt. 
 It's a mother and a child, for Christ's sake. 
 That ain't soldiering. 
 Here. The number is logged in. 
 Just think about it. 
 Still triple, or I walk.

 Iraq. 
 You got a hell of a break missing out on that one.

 What about Dalton? 
 Do I tell her? 
 No.

 Definitely not. 
 Let's not make this an issue until it is one, all right? 
 ♪ 
 Hanson : There's not a better soldier out there, and you know it. 
 Matlock : It's not your skill set. 
 It's how you apply it. 
 But once 20 know I'm around, Stonebridge won't give a sh1t about you. 
 All they care about is payback. 
 And that's your idea of keeping a low profile, is it? 
 Ramping up this vendetta. 
 Ok, then I'll kill him, solve the problem that way. 
 You should have done that in the first place instead of shooting his wife. 
 Don't ever judge me.

 Hmm. 
 As soon as he knows that RV point, then he'll tell us and we'll just go and snatch them. 
 What if it's a set-up? 
 I'm just asking. 
 You trust this guy, Scott? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 This is the weapon Scott took from one of Matlock's men at the airport. 
 I checked the serial number, found its provenance to see where Matlock was getting his weapons from. 
 It's Rwandan. 
 It's one of these. 
 Woman : Hundreds of Rwandan weapons-- the cause of so much misery and death, now being sent to their own destruction courtesy of the Conrad Knox foundation. 
 The decommissioning of these weapons is just the start of a widespread program to... 
 Baxter : That's Ava Knox, one of the foundation's directors. 
 The public face of the company. 
 And she's kind of hot. 
 Baxter : This is one of the weapons listed by the Rwandan authorities as sold to the Conrad Knox foundation for destruction. 
 So Matlock's using the stolen weapons from the decommissioning sites. 
 So there's another connection. Richmond. 
 Richmond : When I was looking into John Devers, I came across this. 
 Stonebridge : Ha. 
 Conrad Knox. 
 Mr. f*cking Africa? 
 You guys telling me that is our new target? 
 A guy who builds hospitals all over the country. 
 He could certainly afford Matlock and the acquisition of those triggers. 
 He's on first-name terms with most of the cabinet. 
 If we're wrong about this, he could bury us. 
 I've, uh, spoken to the Lord Chief Justice. 
 The courts will rule against Section 20. 
 This time tomorrow, you will have Mr. Evans in your care.

 Very well, thank you. 
 Johan will graduate from Harvard this summer.

 Of course, he's, uh, looking forward to repaying your faith in him.
