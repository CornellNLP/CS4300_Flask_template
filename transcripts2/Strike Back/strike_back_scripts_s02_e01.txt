 (ELECTRICITY ZAPPING) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Captor : (YELLS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 (SPITS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 (READING) To the Imperialist Powers of the West... I...  John Porter... Confess to the crime, of being a British spy. Trespassing on the holy soil of Pakistan... 
 Computer-generated voice : I've been tracking lot we have Porter's location. Man : Satellite telemetry in place. Woman : We have visual. Man : Confirmed. Porter : The Pakistani people have tasted humiliation and contempt for decades. Re-scan. (COMPUTER BEEPING) Man : Rooftop's clear. Man : (OVER RADIO) No snipers visible. Porter : Her sons murdered, her holy places desecrated... (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Latif...demands the immediate release... Porter : Of all his oppressed brothers being held in British and American prisons. (HELMET CAM BEEPS ON) In position. Woman : Head cam's up. Stonebridge. Stonebridge : (ON RADIO) Colonel. Grant : (ON RADIO) Bring John home. With pleasure. (FIRES GUN) Oh. (CHAINS RATTLING) Stonebride : Stairs going up. Porter : Unless his brothers are freed... My life will be sacrificed as just retribution. God is great... You ready for this? f*ck yeah. Glory to Islam. Standby, standby. (EXPLOSION) (YELLING) (GUNSHOTS FIRED) Soldier : Clear! They've moved him. Kyle... Stonebridge : (ON RADIO) John's not here. Check for Intel. Anything you can find. Stonebridge : Kyle, come in. Got something here, boss! (GUN FIRED) (GURGLING) sh1t! All right, Kyle. Stay with me. Stay with me, buddy. f*ck! Stay with me! Stay with me! (YELLING) (INCOHERENT YELLING) (CHATTERING ON RADIO) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Captain, this was your operation. What went wrong? We committed too fast, with inadequate surveillance of the target location... And ineffective perimeter security. Has the rash cooled, Captain? All due respect Major, when was the last time you stepped out from behind a desk? Stonebridge. Sinclair's right. It was rash. Captain, anything else to add? Our intel was good. Grant : Mmm-hmm. Porter was there. We had a small window of opportunity... If we'd waited any longer then we would've... Porter would still have been gone, and maybe one of our best men would be alive. We analyzed the map of Delhi and the mobile phone that you recovered. Several calls were logged on throwaway phones, in India, but... None of it is actionable intel. Well, if Latif's men are calling Delhi, they may well be planning something there. Possibly "Project Dawn." True. But we still don't know what "Project Dawn," is yet, do we? That's what Porter was supposed to find out. All we know... Is that Latif has vowed to launch a devastating attack on British and American citizens. And as of now, I have to report to the MOD that we have nothing. We cannot afford any more mistakes. I cannot afford any more mistakes. Understood? Both : Colonel. Grant : Okay. Thank you, Kate. (DOOR OPENS) I need you to locate this man. Grant : His name is Damien Scott, ex-Delta Force. Colonel. Major. (SCREAMING) (MOANING) What the f*ck? Whoo. Don't you knock? I own this place. You own everything in this shithole, Ong. Now, what do you want? I have a lot of money riding on this fight. You tell Igor to lay off the nose, huh? All right, where's my ringgit? You'll be paid. After. (SCOFFS) f*ckin' asshole. You win for Treena, Scott? Not this time, honey. Not this time. (YELLING) Ong, lay off the nose, huh? Yeah, f*ck you too. (GRUNTS) (CROWD YELLS) f*ck! Lay off the f*ckin' nose! Crowd : (REPEATEDLY) Igor! Ha! (CHEERING) (VOICES BECOME DISTORTED) (EARS RINGING) (CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING) Man : Get some water. What the f*ck, Ong? I said, "Not the nose." Treena : Come on, Scott! (BELL RINGS) (CROWD CHEERING) Treena : Scott! Scott! Referee : Fight! (GRUNTS) f*ck! (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GRUNTING) (BONES BREAK) Ahhh! Come on, Igor! Get up! (CHEERING) (LAUGHING) Yeah! Get up! Crowd : (REPEATEDLY) Igor! Treena : (LAUGHING) Woo-hoo! Ah, sh1t! Treena : Scott! (MURMURING) Woman : Hi, Scott! Hey, honey. (MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Hey, sexy. Hey. (LOUD MOANING) Not a bad fight back there. Once y d decided to fight, that is. Really? So... Who you with? SAS, or... SBS? Section 20. High-risk, priority targets. Oh, wow. You're such hot sh1t, what are you doing here? John Porter. What about him? He was undercover in Pakistan looking for a man named Latif. Latif found Porter instead. What's that got to do with me? You and Porter were the only soldiers ever to see Latif. Back in 2002. You must be really desperate, buddy. There's a HERC waiting to take us back to London. Since you're packing your bags anyway. Ong's looking for you! Yeah, I know. Treena : He's very angry! (LAUGHING) I know. How much? How much? Yeah, you want my help finding Porter, I want cash. And a lot of it. I thought you and Porter were mates. Yeah. We were. But now, as you can see, I'm retired. Dishonorably discharged, on the eve of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Not even the PMCs will touch you. Yeah. That's right. So, if you don't want to pay me, well, you can go f*ck yourself. You're not going to leave me! Oh, just for a couple of days, honey. Here, thanks, thanks, honey. You'll get paid. Yeah? More than you're worth. Yeah. What's your name? Stonebridge. Okay, Stonehenge. Time to go. Scott, please! How will I find you? I'll friend you on Facebook, honey. Um, dude. Not that way. Trust me. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Uh... Hold that, buddy. Move over there. Oh! (GRUNTING) Ahhh! Yeah! Can we go now? I'm driving. Scott : Nice hit, buddy. (TREENA YELLING) Stonebridge : Let's go. Come on, Come on. (YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (ENGINE STARTS) STONEBRIDGE: Drive, drive, drive. Come on. Come on. (YELLING) Colonel this is Damien. Oh, Damien Scott. Colonel Grant. Commanding officer of Section 20. This is Major Oliver Sinclair. Captain Kate Marshall. Hello. Captain. A pleasure. This is all very impressive, but, um, I've never actually heard of Section 20. No, of course not. Officially, we don't exist. Kate, I understand you and Porter worked closely with Latif in Afghanistan. It was taken 10 years ago in Peshawar. It's the only photo we have. This guy's former ISI. You're telling me that no one in Pakistan can ID him? No one alive. Latif made sure of that. So, if you could... Take a look at the surveillance photos... Help us identify what he looks like now, then, uh... We have a chance to locate and rescue Porter. Sure, but, uh, not until I get paid. (DOOR OPENS) Colonel, It's Porter. Murphy : Big screen. Sinclair : Contact GCHQ. I want this Website monitored now. Man : Yes, sir. They're transmitting live. Grant : Track IP now. Murphy : Tracking IP. (GRUNTS) (READING) No effort has been made to free the brothers... Being held by the American and British dogs. You cowards. You make me f*cking laugh! Ahhh! (PORTER GRUNTS) (YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Spilled in a ridiculous attempt to rescue me. en... Why don't you just get on with it, you sad f*cking pricks! Ahhh! (CAPTOR YELLS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Sinclair : Satellite lock in three minutes. Latif must speak in the only language the West understands. (WHISPERING) God, no. Blood. (GUN FIRES) Marshall : One more. Thanks. To John. All : To John. R-I-P, buddy. Stonebridge : Same again. Thanks. It's good of you to come. Considering it's an unpaid gig. Yeah, well. He was a damn good soldier. That, he was. I just didn't expect him to die this way. How do you mean? Well, you knew John. His mantra was, "Never give up." No matter what. Yeah. Sometimes you don't have a choice. True. I just thought, maybe he'd... What? Put up more of a fight? Yeah. (GRUNTING) (IN DISTORTED VOICE) Why don't you just get on with it? The West understands...blood. (GUNSHOT FIRED) (REWINDS VIDEO ON COMPUTER) Rescue me... Why don't you just get on with it, you sad f*cking pricks! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (RAIN PATTERING) Porter : No effort has been made to free the brothers... Being held by the American and British dogs... You cowards. You make me f*cking laugh! Holy sh1t. (LAUGHING) Scott : All right, and then... walks in, says, "What's the problem?" He looks. Sees he's butt-naked from the waist down. (LAUGHING) Hey, luv. Have a nice run? Hey, buddy. Nice tights. Can I have a word? Yeah. Damien, why don't you stay for breakfast? I can make a full English, Mike's favorite. Uh, no, thanks. I should break your f*cking neck. Easy, buddy. Hmm? This is home. My home. (CHOKING) I know. It's a great one, too. Kerry's a great girl. How'd you find me? I, uh... Thank you. Trace my mobile? You're not so hard to find. I got something to show you. Where's your laptop? Stonebridge : According to Scott, when him and Porter entered Afghanistan... They used to work with a lot of locals they couldn't always trust. To pass messages back and forth to each other... They came up with a simple numerical code, only they would know. It's pretty basic. You switch each sequential number of the alphabet... With Scott and Porter's new number system. And, "P-R-I-C-K-S" becomes "L-O-T-U-S-H." Stonebridge : Lotus H. You can't be serious. What's "Lotus H?" It could be one in a million things. Including this. The Royal Lotus Hotel, in Delhi. sh1t, Mike. You're clutching at straws. That guy would do anything to get paid. Bear with me. There was one other coded word in Porter's first outburst. Porter : British dogs... Cowards, you make me f*cking laugh! Stonebridge : Deciphered it becomes... (COMPUTER SCANNING) P-Dawn. "Project Dawn." Right. Now, "Lotus H" could have been a lucky guess. But, there's no possible way, Scott could have known about "Project Dawn." Or, its significance to us. (INAUDIBLE TALKING) Porter died trying to tell us what he'd found out about Latif. All right, everyone go home. Take a shower, kiss your partner, feed your dog. (SIGHS) All set, Sergeant. Major, let's prepare the crib. I want everyone assembled at RAF Lakenheath by 1900. We're re-locating to Delhi. Hey. Today's the 15th. You know how much I want this baby. Darling, I'm late as it is. Are you going to walk out on this? (HEAVY BREATHING) (MOANING) Michael. We'll need to take him. Grant : I know, but he was Delta Force once. And, if Latif is in Delhi, then he'll be the one to recognize him. Copy that. (CARS HONKING) (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I.D. (COMPUTERS BEEPING) 
 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Okay, the satellite should be coming up any second now. Major Ashkani. Major, please. Murphy : Colonel. Ashkani : Colonel Grant. Grant : Welcome to "The Crib." This is Captain Kate Marshall, our chief Intel Analyst. Grant : And Major Oliver Sinclair, my second. This is Major Ashkani, Pakistani's ISI's Delhi agent. Please accept my condolences for the loss of your soldier. John Porter was a valiant man. All : Thank you. I better run. Excuse me. Grant : Thank you for coming on such short notice. We have reason to believe that Latif is here in Delhi. Latif here? But why? Mmm-hmm. We don't know. That's why we'd like the assistance from Pakistani intelligence. Of course, but I must ask does the Indian government know you're here? As you can see, Major, we like to keep a low profile. (BELL DINGS) Stonebridge : Thanks very much. There you are, Mr. Langly. Thank you, Mr. Byers. Your credit card. Enjoy your stay. Hey. Rooms are that way. Yeah, I know. The bar is this way. Life's just one long pussy prowl for you, isn't it? (LAUGHING) I'm on the case, Mr. Byers. The bar is the first place a good Muslim would go to blend in. (SARCASTICALLY) Hmm. It's really great to have you on the team. Marshall : (ON EARPIECE) Michael, you in? Yes, I'm in. What do you see? (CHILDREN YELLING) Six cameras in total. Four in the lobby, one in each corner, two at the entrance. I think I found where to tap into their feed. Okay, well, I'll be there in about... About five minutes. Cabbie : Make it 10! Better make it 10. Excuse me. Can I get a Laphroaig on the rocks, please? A single or double? Ah, it depends. How soon you get off? Are you hitting on me? Is it working? I'll make it a double. Yep. Thanks. This is the Royal Lotus, isn't it? Sorry? This hotel. Is it the Royal Lotus? You don't know where you are? Not most of the time. Another lost American. Yeah. How about you? Just a very tired Brit. Here alone. Traveling for business. You're psychic. Thank you. Why don't you let me, uh, buy you another drink, and, I'll amaze you some more. No thanks. I'm just leaving. (BEEPING) (ELEVATOR DINGS) (CLEARS THROAT) (ELEVATOR DINGS) That's a really pretty ring. (LAUGHS) Why me? I like you. You don't know me. I can tell that we'd hit it off. Too bad we'll never find out. (ELEVATOR DINGS) Yeah. Uh, going down? Up. (ELEVATOR DINGS) Do you have a picture? Hang on a sec. Roger that. Julia? Murphy : (ON SPEAKER) Standing by. Got it. Start official scans. Roger. Asashkani : Surely, you can't expect to recognize Latif, based on... CCTV feeds and a 10-year-old photograph? Major, we need your help to identify known associates. We have a man on the inside that can identify Latif. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Barmaid : Room Service. Hey. You alone? Uh, yeah. You know, I don't remember telling you my room number. You wrote it on the bill. Yeah. You off work already? I'm on a break. (LAUGHING) (SPEAK IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Marshall : Thank you. Kate. Yeah, I'm here. Just outside the entrance. Thanks. I think we have trouble. Okay, coming in now. Hi, it's just a PC. Thank you, Ma'am. There, only 10. Stonebridge : (ON EARPIECE) Got it? Got it. (IN HINDI) May I check your bag, please? Uh... Hey! (FIRES GUN) (SCREAMING) Down, down! Get down, now! Stonebridge : Stay down! Stay down! Down! (GUNFIRE ERUPTS) f*ck. (IN HINDI) Kate! Go! Go, go, go! Okay, I need up-res re-scans now! Woman : Scanning now. Computer : Re-scanning... (YELLING) Woman : Losing feed, repeat, losing feed! sh1t. Michael, come in. Michael, can you hear me? (MOANING) (GUNSHOTS FIRED) Shh, shh, shh. Barmaid : What? Scott! Be quiet. (YELLING IN HINDI) (GUNSHOT FIRED) Get in the bathroom. What?? Shh, shh. Get in the bathroom. Scott : Be quiet. (GRUNTING) (BONES BREAKING) (GUNSHOTS FIRED) (GASPS) Get dressed. (YELLING IN HINDI) (SIRENS WAILING) f*ck. Pressure on that. Woman : Thank you very much. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Sorry! Sorry! Marshall : (ON EARPIECE) Michael? Michael, can you hear me? I'm here. Thank Christ. Okay, give me a sit rep? Sixteen young men. In total, Pakistani. Late 20's, early 30's. All armed with AK's. So, how'd they get past security? Bags were already in the lobby. They're rounding up civilians. Six or seven dead. Three or four wounded. It's Mumbai all over again. Stonebridge, Is Scott with you? No. He's not among the hostages. (NO DIAL TONE) f*ck. What are you doing? You got a phone in here? It's downstairs. We could someone call for help. Yeah. We will... But right now I need you to do exactly what I tell you, okay? (GASPS) Hey, it's okay. It's okay. I just want to go home. I know, I know, and I'll get you there. If you do exactly what I tell you. All right? Yes. Yes. Listening to me? All right, now come with me. Don't look down. Don't look at them. Just come with me. (YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Passport or cell phone! Easy. (YELLING CONTINUES) My back. Sorry. Come on. Bespectacled man : I saw what you did... I'm sorry? When the shooting started...t hose people you helped. (COMPUTER BEEPING) Are you a policeman? No, a tourist. You? A tourist, yes. Hey, come on. (REPEATEDLY) Back! (GUNSHOTS FIRED) (SCREAMING) (YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) f*ck. (CHATTERING ON RADIOS) (MURMURING) Reporter : I've just arrived outside The Royal Lotus Hotel in downtown Delhi... Where we have received reports of gunfire. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) Kate. Are you there? Michael, I'm here. Directly behind the entrance doors, they've rigged a necklace of IEDs. The Army so much as kick them, it'll detonate it. Well, can you defuse it? Not right now. Colonel. Go ahead. I think it's time we made our presence known. Understood. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Some of the terrorists have been killed. He's saying someone shot at them. Good man. Come in here. Come in here. (SCREAMS) Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Come here. No, I'm not going in! I need you to stay here, okay? They're not gonna search the same room twice. You understand? Stay there. (WHISPERING) Okay. (GURGLING) Ahhh! What's going on? sh1t. Okay, hang on, buddy. Hang on. Barmaid : I'll get help... Go to the bathroom, get me some towels. I'll get help. No, no, no you stay here. f*ck! (STRUGGLING TO BREATHE) Hang on, two seconds, buddy. Be right back. Hang on, buddy. Hang on. Okay, don't talk. (STOPS BREATHING) Don't... f*ck! f*ck. (BANGING FROM WARDROBE) (WHIMPERING) Just what I need. Hey... It's okay. It's ok, honey. You all right? You gotta come with me. Come on. Come on. I'm not a bad man. Come on, it's okay. Come on. There we go. We go for a ride. (GRUNTS) There we go. You okay? Yeah. Just put your head down there. Okay? You're okay. And, don't you look up. All right? Just keep your head down. This man is definitely Shabbir. One of Latif's lieutenants. Sinclair : Do you recognize any of the other men in these pictures? Marshall : This is the crib. Colonel. All right, everyone out, now. Major General's here. Major General Kohli, I'm Colonel Grant. You are on Indian soil, Colonel Grant. Indian soil. Without prior permission or consent. I appreciate that, Sir. But, we are here pursuing the Pakistani terrorist, Latif. I see. And, yet, you choose to involve the very same intelligence agency... That turns a blind eye to Latif's activities. Latif is as much an enemy of our government as yours, Sir. Countless Pakistanis have died at his hands... The government of Pakistan is weak, corrupt, and riddled with traitors. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't impound this facility... And place you all under arrest. Because, General, I am willing to give you full access to our resources here at the section. I can take that. And, we have two operatives inside the hotel. (DEVICE BEEPS) Marshall : (ON EARPIECE) Michael? I'm here. Colonel Grant wants you to be eyes and ears of the Indian Army. Understood. I need to find Scott first. Marshall : And then what? The two of you take out 16 armed men? That's the general idea. Hey, tourist. Who are you talking to? (IN URDU) (IN URDU) "Mahmood" must come forward. He says "Mahmood" must come forward. (YELLING) (SCREAMING) Shh... Victim : Please, please  (IN URDU) If you are Mahmood, step forward now. Translator : If you are Mahmood, step forward now. Or blood will be shed. Or, or blood will be shed. (WHIMPERING) You have 10 seconds to identify yourself or the old man dies. (COUNTING DOWN) 10... Translator : Ten... Colonel. (SHABBIR CONTINUES COUNTDOWN) They're going to execute a man. Stonebridge do nothing to give yourself away. Shabbir : 6, 5, 4... Translator : 6, 5, 4... I'm so sorry. 3, 2, 1... 3, 2, 1... (FIRES GUN) (SCREAMING) (YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Stonebridge, do not intervene. Man : Let me go! (CRYING) 10, 9, 8, 7... Translator : 10, 9, 8, 7... 6, 5, 4, 3... 6, 5, 4, 3... (FIRE ALARM RINGING) (YELLING) Thank you. Thank you. Please, please, take us with you. I know a way out! Hotel worker : Through the laundry, in the basement. Show me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. (ELEVATOR DINGS) (WHISPERING) Okay. Hey. Shh. Okay, come on. Come on. It's okay. Okay, it's okay. Hello? It's the guy from the bar. I'm here to help. (DOOR UNLOCKS) Get out! Get the f*ck out now! Get out! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! f*ck me. You all right? Okay, you're gonna come with me. You're gonna go straight across that hall. Okay? Go. Go across. In the bathroom. In there. Come on. Can you get me out of here? Yeah, I'm working on that. I need to hide here, okay? I gotta find a safe exit. You look after her. I'll be back. (DOOR OPENS) Stonebridge, report. Stonebridge : Colonel. I know what... (DOOR CLOSES) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Stonebridge : Scott! f*ck me! Scott : f*ck. "Friendlies." Where the f*ck you been? Ya know? Saving lives, shooting bad guys. How many numbnuts you taken out? Two. You? (LAUGHS) Three. (LAUGHS) That's good. That leaves 11. You wanna shoot some more? If I have to. Colonel. I've just located Scott. I told you not to break cover. Yeah, I know. But I've just doubled our chances of defusing that IED. First things first, though. I have two hostages I have to get safety. Hey, you two know a way outta here? Yes, downstairs. Awesome. Hey, buddy, I gotta go back upstairs, though. Why? A girl I met in the bar. You gotta be kidding me? Not like that. Okay, wait, wait... We've, uh, we've all gotta stick together here. Copy that. Colonel. Sergeant. I think I know why Latif's men are in the building. They're looking for someone named "Mahmood." Mahmood? Stonebridge : Yeah. Stonebridge : The gunmen are going through passports They're trying to locate him. Which means Latif can't know what Mahmood looks like. Why take an entire hotel hostage for one man? Well, I don't think it was supposed to happen that way. From what I saw those boys panicked. I don't know. These men were prepared. They had weapons, explosives. Maybe the gun men and the hostages were a smokescreen. Sinclair : A way of hiding his true target. Right. But the gun men, they were intercepted by security. Stonebridge : They drew their weapons too quickly... And the siege started before they could locate Mahmood. We're missing the point. Latif has no intention of letting anyone in or out of that building... Until he's got what he needs. Grant : Which means only one thing... Latif is still inside the hotel. (DOOR OPENS) Aw, you! (YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) f*ck. You can stop looking. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)
