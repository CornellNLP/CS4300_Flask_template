 We have growing evidence that your father is stockpiling nuclear triggers. 
 You'd need to ask him yourself. 
 You are a liability, Scott. 
 Knox is running rings around you, and I'm the liability? 
 The goal remains a strong Africa, just as America is strong, and every other nuclear power. 
 What the f*ck did you do that for? 
 It's my way out. 
 Knox : He took out the whole of your security detail. 
 Hire him. 
 Scott : Take the shot, buddy! It's your kill! 
 Hold fire. 
 It's loaded with radioactive materials. 
 Let it go. 
 We are about to be deported. 
 Knox has gone dark. 
 It's time we went dark, too.

 Mr. Lutulu, Conrad Knox sends his best wishes. 
 I thought it was relatively simple. 
 As I said, there are still components that need to be configured. 
 It is not a design that I am completely familiar with. 
 Well, how long will it take? 
 I want them moved north as soon as possible. 
 48 hours. No more.

 You know what I don't get? 
 Why isn't Knox's picture up on every freaking news channel in the world? 
 The triggers are one thing, but fully functioning nukes? 
 There are no nukes. 
 They were all decommissioned, remember? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 That's right. 
 But don't you think there should be an international f*cking manhunt or something? 
 Dalton : And that may very well come, Scott, but right now, we are the only people looking for him. 
 And as you may have picked up, we are persona non grata in South Africa, and that is why we are running this operation covertly. 
 So be in no doubt-- cry for help, nobody's going to come running for us. 
 Major Sinclair, we have a lead. 
 Sinclair : Yes. Detention center in Harare, Zimbabwe. 
 Until 7 hours ago, it was home to this man, Walter Lutulu, leader of the party for a democratic Zimbabwe. 
 Knox is a known supporter. 
 Dalton : Someone broke him out at 2 AM last night. 
 That's no small task, is it? 
 Hmm. It's a top-tier outfit. 
 Scott : What, are you thinking Matlock? 
 Well, according to intelligence sources in Harare, the breakout crew left a man behind. 
 Richmond : He's been identified as Sebastien Boucher, an ex-foreign legion merc who's been on Matlock's payroll since the abduction of Evans. 
 Sinclair : Where Lutulu has been taken and why, and the connection with the WMD has yet to be determined. 
 But right now it's the only lead we've got. 
 Sinclair : Lutulu has a daughter--Lilian. 
 He made contact two hours ago. 
 Walter : Lily... it's me. 
 Sinclair : That's an intercept of Walter Lutulu's voiceprint. 
 Walter : I can't talk long. 
 Someone will come and bring you to me. 
 It will be safe for you to do what they say. 
 [Garbled transmission] 
 I'm sorry... 
 Sinclair : The voice in the background could be Knox, now, we can't trace the source of the call, but we do know where it went to. 
 Richmond : Lilian runs a law center for Zimbabwean refugees in Bukhoma-- a township 3 miles from here. 
 Dalton : Chances are one of Knox's crew will be making the pickup. 
 Your job is to track and report back. 
 Knox is mission priority. 
 We play our cards right, Lutulu's daughter could lead us right to him. 
 There she is. 
 Got her. 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 She's hot. 
 Very. 
 [Women talking] 
 Sinclair : She's not just a pretty face. 
 She's Harvard-educated. 
 Could have had a stellar career at the UN. 
 But decided to come home and work for her father's cause. 
 Lilian : Don't worry. 
 Your children will not be put out onto the streets. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Ok. See you later. 
 Reckon she... might date a soldier? 
 I think you'd need an IQ in double digits, mate. 
 Counts you out, buddy. 
 Ooh. 
 Matlock : The Musina contingent. 
 They'll be on the Limpopo River by nightfall. 
 Good. Well, the rest of the equipment will be with you in a couple of days. 
 Excellent. 
 Bring her straight here. 
 Lilian will be with us shortly. 
 My men are just moving into the township now. 
 I can't wait to see her. 
 She's doing sterling work with the refugee community. 
 Whipping up support for the party. 
 Please, sit. 
 Walter : I see you have been busy yourself. 
 Knox : Oh, yes. 
 My plans are well advanced. 
 Good, because we must be quick. 
 A leader in exile commands little respect. 
 How many men do you have? 
 Mr. Matlock, how many men do we have? 
 Over 800. 
 Knox : Hmm. 
 All special forces trained. 
 One team are already in Zimbabwe, another two on the border, a third on their way. 
 I'm holding 50 back. 
 So, what's the situation with you and the army? 
 Two of the generals are old friends. 
 I am assured of their support. 
 Do you trust them? 
 We fought together in the war for independence. 
 I trust them with my life. 
 ♪ 
 Hi. 
 Come on in, Lilian. 
 Baxter : Target on the move. 
 Heads up. 12 o'clock. 
 Got it. 
 Scott : Do you think that's her contact? 
 Stonebridge : They certainly don't look like Matlock's boys, do they? 
 Scott : Someone should probably go and take a closer look, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 You probably should get out there. 
 [Chuckles] 
 f*ck. You wanted to get out from behind the desk. 
 Yeah. Well, it beats sitting in an office writing your paychecks. 
 Scott : All right. 
 Stonebridge : Try and blend in, Sinclair. 
 Huh. 
 Scott : What do you call that look? 
 Gangster Gilligan? 
 Stonebridge : I think Dalton dressed him. 
 [Man speaking foreign language] 
 They've got comms and a file on Lilian. 
 Sinclair : What do you want me to do? 
 Do not engage unless absolutely necessary, Bravo Team. 
 Dalton : This is a surveillance operation only. 
 [Tires screech] 
 All right, that looks like it's gonna go live. 
 Hang on, bud. 
 Zimbabwean intelligence. 
 Please come with us. 
 I don't think so. 
 I said come with us. 
 Richmond : What the hell is he doing? 
 Ah! Take your hands off me. 
 He's going to get himself killed. 
 Brother, please, I am hungry. 
 [Speaks foreign language] 
 Lilian : Leave him alone! 
 I am just hungry. 
 Lilian : I said leave him alone. 
 You've got no right-- 
 Man : I warned you. 
 Back off. 
 Sinclair : Run! 
 Stonebridge : Move, move! 
 [Engine revs] 
 Sinclair, down, down! 
 Dalton : Bravo, get out of there now! 
 sh1t. 
 You all right? 
 She's gone. 
 Get the f*ck off my car. 
 Let's go! 
 Let's move! 
 Scott : Get in the car! 
 Get in the car! 
 Let's go! 
 It's me. I know where the girl is. 
 Matlock : You know what to do. 
 Dalton : This was supposed to be a stealth operation. 
 Low-key. 
 Sorry. We didn't have much of a choice. 
 You manage to keep a track on Lilian? 
 I'm afraid we lost her. 
 She disappeared into the township, and that place is like a rabbit warren. 
 Stonebridge : There is a chance that she was injured in the attack. 
 Scott : Yeah. If it wasn't for Rambo here, she'd probably be dead. 
 Sinclair : Well, I think the shooters were Zimbabwean. 
 From what I could hear, they were talking in Shona. 
 Dalton : What? Secret police? 
 Revenge attack for Walter Lutulu's escape? 
 Well, if we're right and Lutulu is a catalyst for dissent, then we could be looking at the beginning of a coup. 
 Walter Lutulu with nukes? 
 He's no hawk. I mean, he spent the last decade agitating for democracy. 
 He was a freedom fighter once. 
 Fought alongside Mugabe. 
 Nukes or not, they will need outside help if they're going to make a move on Zimbabwe. 
 Help from who? 
 Dalton : Let's start with the CIA. 
 Elements within the administration have been banging on for years about the Chinese taking over Africa. 
 Zimbabwe up for grabs? 
 They'd definitely want a piece. 
 Let Knox do the dirty work and then move in. 
 Right. Scott, a word. 
 Scott : Yeah. 
 We've identified 6 key figures-- hard-liners in the Politburo. 
 With those out of the way... 
 Matlock : We have assassins on stand-by, Mr. Lutulu, ready to strike at the first stage of the assault. 
 Walter : Some of these men are old comrades. 
 I had hoped to turn them around. 
 A bloodless coup? 
 Ballots, not bullets. 
 Knox : Some of those same men would have seen you hanged, Walter. 
 If I hadn't moved when I did, you'd be dead already. 
 What must be done must be done. 
 But I do not want unnecessary deaths on my conscience. 
 Power bought with blood will stain us all. 
 Hmm. 
 Papa, I can hardly believe it's true. 
 Papa. 
 Mr. Knox. 
 There were Zimbabwean Military Intelligence, CIO, in the township, looking to arrest her. 
 So the regime is striking out already. 
 Did you stop them? 
 I didn't need to. 
 Section 20 did that for me. 
 They were already there. 
 Are you certain? 
 100%. I recognized Stonebridge and Scott. 
 Get me Dreyer on the phone. 
 He assured me they'd been dealt with. 
 [Sea gulls cawing] 
 You, uh, fishing for information? 
 I see what you did there. 
 Good, huh? 
 No. 
 It's clever. 
 If I'm not back in 10 minutes, then call the coast guard. 
 ♪ 
 You missed feeding time. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 I heard about the Mossad agent-- 
 Rebecca Levi. 
 What about her? 
 True you couldn't kill her? 
 Not couldn't. 
 Just wouldn't. 
 Redemption in a bullet. 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 She was looking for a way out. 
 She's not the only one. 
 No sh1t. 
 I want to go home. 
 I need you to clean my record, Christy. 
 20 is tracking weapons of mass destruction, right? 
 Who are you targeting? 
 Conrad Knox, but you already know that. 
 He was behind that jailbreak in Zimbabwe that freed Walter Lutulu. 
 Can you tell me where Knox is? 
 Ha. Dalton tell you to ask me that? 
 You are working for the wrong woman. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 If you really do want to go home, there will be a price to pay. 
 You do understand that? 
 Yeah. 
 Sinclair : There's no sign of Lilian. 
 Knox must have got her out of there by now. 
 Or she could have gone to ground. 
 Major, we have a security breach. 
 Dalton : sh1t. 
 It's Dreyer. 
 How the hell did he find us? 
 Lock the systems down immediately. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Dalton : Contact Stonebridge and Scott. 
 Sinclair : I need one minute. 
 Richmond : Bravo Team, the crib is under immediate threat. 
 It's Dreyer. 
 Stonebridge : Roger that. 
 Scott, let's move! Go. 
 Scott : Let's go. 
 [Tires screech] 
 Dalton : Mr. Dreyer, I can explain. 
 Dreyer : You were supposed to be on a plane home. 
 Instead, you're sending black operatives into the townships and killing people. 
 Dreyer : I'm charging you with crimes against the Republic of South Africa. 
 Dalton : I understand that we've been sailing fairly close to the wind-- 
 Get them out of here. 
 Baxter : Get your hands off me. 
 Uh! 
 Thanks to you, we have a major diplomatic incident on our hands with Zimbabwe. 
 You had your chance to leave. 
 What happens now is of your own making. 
 Get them out. 
 Come on, out! 
 Dreyer : You know where to take them. 
 Man : Move your ass. 
 Go! Move! 
 Lilian : I don't want to talk about that now. 
 Walter : Ok. I'll just accept it. 
 You have a boyfriend. 
 Lilian : Ha! You can't ask me that. 
 What do you mean, I can't ask you, eh? 
 I'm allowed to ask you things. 
 I'm your father. 
 Papa, believe me. 
 News of your escape has filtered out. 
 The regime tried to suppress it, but they couldn't hold that news for long. 
 Then neither must I. 
 The people will be anxious to know that I am ok. 
 You could announce your return in Bukhoma. 
 There's an army of activists already in place. 
 I could prepare them for your appearance. 
 Harness social media. 
 Facebook. Twitter. 
 Look, a public appearance now could be quite dangerous. 
 You know that. 
 A leader cannot command respect from behind the shadows. 
 Believe me, if my people thought that I was afraid, they would never follow me.

 Not yet, no. 
 I haven't found the right moment. 
 Did you know his daughter has been in contact with the same army factions that support her father? 
 If the regime had killed Walter, the opposition planned to install her as the front runner to the CDZ. 
 Charming girl. 
 You've met her? 
 I made it my mission. 
 Today's activist is tomorrow's leader. 
 She knows who her friends are. 
 How does she feel about that? 
 Do you know? 
 She shares her father's steel.

 So when was I supposed to see them? 
 At the march-past in a victory parade? 
 Well, I haven't got these weapons to take power-- simply to help us hold on to it. 
 Our task-- yours and mine-- is to give Africa what it's always been denied-- strength. 
 You want to turn Zimbabwe into a nuclear power? 
 No. The world we live in, you can't negotiate from a position of weakness. 
 I thought you would understand that. 
 I want to repair relations with the international community. 
 I want to see sanctions lifted, not to turn us into a pariah state! 
 L-listen, Walter. 
 We have a deal. 
 Not for this! 
 I've risked a lot to get these weapons. 
 They're my gift to you, along with Zimbabwe itself. 
 What makes you think that it is within your power to give me my own country? 
 I liberated you. 
 I set you free. 
 To do what? 
 To take control of our resources? 
 Our gold mines, our diamonds, our uranium? 
 No. 
 You have already spoken of taking control of the mining franchise. 
 Yes, to put the money back into the economy, where it belongs, not into my pocket. 
 I have more money than I can spend in a dozen lifetimes, and a great deal of it has gone into financing this coup.
