 Erstwhile on  Fargo... 
 You're not gonna prove my Ed did anything wrong! 
 It's unprovable! 
 Lou : There was a cleaver in the man's head, son, which Noreen said was you. 
 Not to mention there's a war going on up in Fargo that you may have started when you ran over that Gerhardt boy. 
 Floyd : You take care of this butcher. 
 He doesn't live through the night. 
 Already dead, believe me. He just doesn't know it. 
 Peggy : Sheriff? 
 Hank : Go inside now, Peggy. 
 Go now. 
 Ed home? 
 Ed who? 
 [ Door creaks ] 
 No, Peggy, hey, hey. 
 When I find ya, darlin', I'm gonna make you bleed. 
 [ Clatter ] 
 Uhh! 
 [ Electricity crackling ] 
 Ed : I need to find Peggy. 
 You're still in my custody. 
 You look worse than me. 
 Hank : Don't tire yourself. 
 We know where he's headed.

 Peggy. 
 Have you actualized fully? 
 What? 
 Have you actualized fully? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, I'm trying. 
 Do you feel cold sometimes, even when it's hot? 
 Sometimes. 
 Do you understand the difference between thinking and being? 
 What do you mean? 
 Do you understand the difference between thinking and being? 
 I-- 
 To be is simply to exist. 
 Try it. 
 Try simply being. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But how is sitting here gonna help me be the best person I can be? 
 Ah. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You want an explanation. 
 Well, kinda. 
 The human mind, aroused by an insistence for meaning, seeks and finds nothing but contradiction and nonsense. 
 Okay. 
 It's just practically, I'm saying. 
 Uh, as a person, a married person, a woman who's worried she's not living up to her full potential. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Think or be. 
 You can't do both. 
 You're saying... don't think about the person I want to be. 
 Just be that person. 
 Peggy. 
 Don't think about the person I want to be. 
 Just be that person. 
 Just be that person. 
 Peggy. 
 Peggy, are you okay? 
 We were just talking, and-- and it all finally makes sense. 
 This lady has lost her mind, brother. 
 Shut up. 
 She's seeing people who are not there. 
 I said "Shut up." 
 And here I am, tied up for no reason, a concerned citizen just walking past, and I-- and I hear a cry for help. 
 No, you're a Gerhardt. 
 And you're sh1t on my shoe. 
 Why don't you come here and let me wipe you off? 
 Okay. The cops are coming. Who knows who else. 
 Okay, no time to pack. Just the clothes on our back. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Did you-- 
 No. 
 It was him. 
 He's the leader, I think. 
 Then we take him with us. 
 Peggy. 
 We're taking his car? 
 Yeah, they'll be looking for ours. 
 I understand now, hon. 
 Come on. 
 Everything, what I have to do. 
 That's good. Now, watch your head.

 I'm calling a medic.

 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 This is just embarrassing. 
 I'll get an APB out on the Gerhardt boys, and, uh, see about starting the hunt for Ed and Peggy. 
 Don't-- don't tell Betsy I'm down.

 I'm gonna call.

 I've just been doing it all wrong. 
 Both of us. 
 We make a trade, hon, is what I'm thinking. 
 Wanting things, pretending to be something we're not. 
 Selling their man back to 'em for freedom. 
 It's like when you're a kid and-- and you need permission to go to the washroom, and-- and you raise your hand and wait for the teacher to call on you. 
 But meantime, you just have to go so bad. 
 I should've looked at his wallet. 
 But you just go. 
 Know exactly who we're dealing with here. 
 You just go. 
 You don't ask. You just go. 
 Till then, hon, we stick to the small roads, out of the way motels, and we just-- we keep moving. 
 A road trip. 
 Wait. Hold the phone. 
 Uncle Grady's got that-- that hunting cabin outside Canistota. 
 It's empty now. We go there and hole up. 
 See? We're moving now. 
 Things are flowing. Not trapped anymore. 
 Well, I-I mean, that was our home. 
 Yeah, but I mean energy-wise, you know? 
 I mean, you got to admit, we were stuck in the mud. 
 Emotionally, I mean. 
 And-- and now, we're flying. 
 We-- we got a plan. That's what matters. 
 We-- we-- we got a plan for how to get out of this. 
 See it then be it. That's from Lifespring. 
 Except-- except the cops. We-- we got to figure out-- we're gonna figure this out.

 That's better. 
 I got to say this whole thing has just been... 
 And, I mean, I'm sorry about your brother. 
 I am, but it was an accident. 
 And this whole thing has just been so-- 
 I mean, I'm trying to stay positive. 
 That's one thing. 
 If you spend any time with me, you'll see. 
 Positive Peggy is what they call me. 
 But this whole thing has just been super hard on Ed. 
 He's a little more delicate, you know? 
 I mean, he's a big guy and all, but deep down, I mean, this whole thing has just been really hard on him. 
 And it's my fault. I know. 
 I mean... I hit the guy. 
 Your brother. 
 And I'm sorry about that. I am. 
 And he was... stepping out into the road. 
 Didn't even look where he was going. 
 No. No. 
 No. 
 And so, Ed, you know, all he did was clean it up. 
 And then you sent those other fellas, and, I mean, what were we supposed to do? 
 You know? 
 So, now I'm hoping-- we're both hoping-- that we can just smooth this all over now and everything can go back to normal. 
 Oh, wait. 
 No, you said you didn't want beans, didn't you? 
 No, it's okay. They're good. 
 Really good, good stuff. 
 No, I-I mean, I should've...

 I made some beans. You want some? 
 Ed : No, that's okay. 
 What happened to him? 
 Oh, well, now, we don't need to talk about that, do we? 
 Water under the bridge. 
 Hon, did you stab the hostage? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 I mean, I had to teach him some manners is all if we're gonna be spending time together. 
 And him so angry when we're the ones who should be angry. 
 I mean, when you get right down to it, it's our shop that burned down. 
 Help. 
 Our house we had to leave behind. 
 She's crazy. Keep her away from me. 
 Hon. 
 Help. 
 Hon. Hon. 
 Hmm? 
 They're-- they're not gonna want him back if we-- if we cut him up too much. 
 Oh, I hardly stuck him at all. 
 I'm hurt real bad. 
 Shut up. 
 I think she punctured a lung. 
 How'd it go with the family? They gonna negotiate? 
 Had to leave a message. 
 Well, you-- you said we had him. 
 Yeah, but it-- it was just like a flunky or something, so I said I'd call back. 
 Okay, well, maybe there's-- 
 Sounds like there's a war going on up there. 
 Maybe they're busy. 
 Yeah, but I mean, if he's such an important guy, you know? 
 Well, hon, don't... 
 Don't doubt yourself, Ed. That was my undoing. 
 See it then be it, right? 
 So, just... have some beans and call back. 
 They'll be home next time for sure.
