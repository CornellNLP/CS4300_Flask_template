 Erstwhile on Fargo... 
 I'm not afraid of a war. 
 But are you with me? 
 We're not gonna make the first move. 
 But if these Kansas City mooks come at you shootin'... we'll cut the goddamn nose off their face. 
 Your Indian killed him. 
 I didn't know that was happening. 
 I wanna know what they're gonna do before they do it. 
 Otherwise, you can die with the rest of them. 
 You sent my goddamn son! 
 The kid said it should be family that pulls the trigger, which is true. 
 He's 17. 
 Sheriff? 
 Go inside now, Peggy. 
 When I find ya, darlin', I'm gonna make you bleed.

 And that-- there's a word for that. 
 It's called "managing up." 
 Which, if you want to rise to any kind of power in this organization, is something you'd better learn. 
 Because they'll say to you, "Go out, do the job, and don't worry." 
 But, in fact, what they mean... is talk 'em through it.

 You understand? 
 It doesn't matter if it's washing machines or cocaine, whores or horseradish, they-- the powers that be-- they need to know...

 Floyd : We waited. 
 Don't like funerals. 
 Simone : Nobody  likes  funerals. 
 I want to thank you boys for coming out from Buffalo and helping us out. 
 We couldn't have fought them off much longer. 
 Forget about it. 
 I'm seeing cows, horses, whaddya? Chickens. 
 It's like wild goddamn kingdom in here. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 We got ups and downs. 
 Tell me. 
 Go see to lunch. 
 I'm grown. I can hear. 
 We got five of theirs, including Management. 
 But they felled Roost and Seymour. 
 That means South Dakota's turned. 
 Which Bear now tells me is where they got the presidents' faces up on the side of a rock. 
 So we should get that back. 
 Nothing from Hanzee? 
 Nothing. 
 Two days. 
 What about my dad? 
 [ Spits ] 
 Gonna need a third hole is my feelin'. 
 Have some respect. 
 My lion didn't raise that boy to be killed by small-town muscle. 
 Thought that about Rye. 
 Now there's nothin' left but clothes. 
 They're just men. 
 What are you sayin'? 
 I said, it's not like my dad's the shark in that movie-- 
 "We're gonna need a bigger boat." 
 He sh1ts and sleeps. 
 I swear, I thought your father was the problem-- his nature... and towards women. 
 But you're two of the same! 
 You're porcupines! 
 You're half crazy, always lookin' for a fight! 
 This family... deserves the ground. 
 I got this. 
 Hey, porcupine? 
 [ Chuckles ] Hey. Where are you running? 
 I shouldn't have hit her. 
 Hey. 
 Hittin's the least of it. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Not enough of us left to start tellin' the truth. 
 Simone : Go to hell. 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 [ Spits ] 
 Last stand or make a run for it? 
 [ Car doors close ] 
 Benjamin. 
 Floyd. 
 It's funeral day. 
 I know. 
 Uh, we waited till the dirt settled, but... now I need you to come with us. 
 It's me you should be takin'. 
 No, you're good. 
 Floyd? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Car door opens ] 
 How's my boy? 
 State pen-- awaitin' trial. 
 You should visit. 
 Where's your brother? 
 Found Jesus. 
 Mm. Joined a monastery. 
 Mm. I just bet. 
 ♪ 
 Phone. 
 Take a message. 
 You're gonna want to take this one, bro. 
 Prick says he knows where Dodd is. 
 Take a message. 
 Gibson : Tell me one more time, why is Floyd Gerhardt sittin' in my interview room? 
 Schmidt : Sir, uh, Trooper Solverson and myself, we're tired of playin' clean-up-- officially. 
 Thought we'd apply some pressure to both sides. 
 Let 'em know all this killin' isn't, uh, goin' unnoticed. 
 What about this butcher? 
 We got an APB out on both Blumquists, Ed and Peggy. 
 So far, nothin'. 
 Could be on the run, could be dead. 
 Should've checked on that girl. 
 Elliot Ness himself deputized my daddy ATF during prohibition. 
 Used to tell stories of Tommy-Gun bloodbaths and heads rollin' in the road. 
 Never thought I'd see it in my lifetime, but here we are. 
 This thing's just plumb out of control. 
 What do you think? 
 Mm. 
 I think I want to live in a world where people leave the front door unlocked. - Yeah. 
 Probably we're just wastin' our breath. 
 Okay. 
 You two go see the out-of-towners. 
 Leave the old broad to us. 
 [ Sniffs, clears throat ] I'm gonna smoke. 
 Ma'am, I'm, uh, Sheriff Larsson, Rock County. 
 Had some differences with your oldest boy yesterday. 
 How'd that go for you? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Uh, let's call it a draw on account of your Indian sucker-punched me 'fore I could make a showin'. 
 Yeah. He does that. 
 Gibson : Sorry to hear about Otto. 
 They shot him in his own home. 
 These Kansas City  hosenscheisser. 
 Children sleepin' upstairs-- savages. 
 My wife passed last summer. 
 We were up in Brainerd, visitin' my sister. 
 Last thing she said to me-- 
 "Do you smell toast?" 
 Different roads, same destination. 
 I suppose. 
 But the question is-- for you, I mean-- how far does it go? 
 Husband dead, plus your youngest, grandson in jail, and now Dodd's missin', we hear. 
 Old-timers had it worse. 
 Used to be 10 born, 2 survived-- consumption, scalpings, smallpox, wolves. 
 Well, it's a question of what you can live with, I suppose-- how many ghosts. 
 I-I shot a man through the teeth in Vichy, France. 
 I still see his face every night before bed. 
 Our backs to the wall. 
 You see that, yeah? 
 Yeah, except I'm the guy in the next state who got shanghaied, and your sons are the ones that took the drive. 
 The butcher of Luverne killed my boy-- on orders from Kansas City. 
 Oh, I've known Ed Blumquist since short pants. 
 If he's workin' for the Kansas City mob, I'll-- I'll cut off my toe. 
 What's it they call those Russians? 
 Sleeper agents. 
 I'm sayin', you think you know someone, but what do you know, really? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I had a kid in here the other day. 
 Stabbed his parents to death in their sleep. 
 When I asked him why, he couldn't say. 
 It just come over him all of a sudden. 
 The stories used to be simpler. That's for sure. 
 This, then that-- 
 And now I don't know where it starts or how it ends. 
 I truly don't. 
 Without bein' simplistic, this thing's over when you say it's over. 
 No. They won't stop-- my boys. 
 They've lost too much. They're too proud. 
 Well, okay, then. 
 How about you help us out? 
 You know these Kansas City fellas. 
 Point us in the right direction there-- you know, weaknesses, indiscretions. 
 Give us somethin' actionable, and maybe we make this whole, uh... northern expansion unpalatable. 
 [ Chuckles softly ] 
 Snitch. 
 Well, uh... you said yourself-- hard to be simple in times of complication.

 Mike : Yes, sir. Maybe... 
 "Under control" was the wrong phrase given what's happened. 
 Hamish : - You said-- when they killed Bulo, you said this Gerhardt outfit was a stuffed shirt. 
 Now I'm standing here with blood on my socks! 
 I can handle it. 
 The hell, you say. 
 Braverman stood for you, said, "He's not like the other darkies. 
 This one's smart, capable." 
 Sir-- 
 But that is not what I'm seeing. 
 And I appreciate the opportunity... sir, believin', as I do, like the good Dr. King said, "A man should be judged on the content of his character, not the color of his skin." 
 Yeah, he's dead. 
 You're gonna need a different quote. 
 I can break this family. 
 Two weeks. 
 You got two days. 
 Then I'm sending the undertaker. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 You-- Aah!-- Son of a bitch! 
 "Freedom, that terrible word inscribed upon the chariot of the storm." 
 What? 
 You want me to repeat it? 
 Is that a quote? 
 Maybe. 
 What do you want, little girl? 
 You were supposed to kill my dad, not the old cripple! 
 What's the difference? 
 What?! 
 To quote Louis XVI... 
 "Est-ce une révolte?" 
 "Non, sire. 
 C'est une révolution." The Duke of La Rochefoucauld. Are we gonna talk, or are you just gonna quote the Thesaurus at me?! I mean, if the goal is to kill those who oppress you, what does it matter who goes first? Because! I said! Now, ironically, in astronomy, the word "revolution" means "a celestial object that comes full circle." Did you know that? Which, if you think about it, is pretty funny, considering here on earth it means change. You're nuts. I'm talkin' about a promise! You could've killed me shootin' up the house, or grandma! [ Grunts ] Unless... Would you say you're her favorite? Who?! The mater-familias. In my experience, the first-born granddaughter, well, she's always the shine on the apple. Oh, God.

I'm not sayin' "Don't come back." [ Breathing heavily ] [ Elevator bell dings ] I'm a big girl. You don't have to nursemaid me. Floyd know you're here? Yeah. Yeah, I've seen you around up at the compound. Seen me? Or watched me? I'm aware, I'm sayin', that the last place you should be is in a hotel room with those fellas, especially given what's happenin'... You won't tell, though. Will you? I don't... have to. Ohh! Ow, Jesus! Oh, Jesus! Oh! If I'm going to the noose, I'm going, but I'm done lyin' down for men. Schmidt : [ Groans ] Ohh! [ Groans ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Engine revs, shuts off ] Hey. I, uh... I just... I was out of weed. So I bought a dime bag from, uh, Packy. You know, with the, uh... Not safe around here for us. Simone : Yeah? Wow. No one tells me nothin'. But I'll... Look, I can score weed other places. Thanks for the, uh... Come on, I'll give you a ride. I got my car. Ricky will drive it back. You two have fun, huh? [ Engine turns over ] [ Engine turns over ] Seat belt on. So... is this a conversation about how it's time for me to pack up and go home? No. Don't have to go home. It's a big country. Just maybe don't be  here. Are you familiar with the phrase "manifest destiny"? Yeah, but see, here's the thing. I own two pairs of shoes-- a summer pair and one for winter. We're not meant to have more than we can handle, is what I mean. So, this need for conquest, you know, tryin' to own things that aren't meant to be owned-- Like people? That's an example. But also places-- believin' we can tame things. That's a problem, right? Not a solution. You're saying capitalism is a problem? No. Greed. Makin' this thing all or nothin'. [ Door opens ] Schmidt : [ Sighs, groans ] What happened to you? Hmm? What happened? What happened? Let's just get this over with, huh? So, you got a response to my "all or nothin'" line? Sometimes-- There's a man. What-- what man? Just a man. He works in a factory. One day, the boss gets it in his mind that this man is stealing from him. So, every night at the gate, the guards search his wheelbarrow. But they never find anything. Pat him down. Oh, they do that. Strip him naked-- nothin'. So... he's not stealin'. Of course he is. Wheelbarrows. Thank you. That's right. He's stealing wheelbarrows. What? My point is sometimes the answer is so obvious you can't see it because you're looking too hard. See, we can't leave because we're the future, and they're the past. The past can no more become the future than the future can become the past. Okay. We said our piece. Just don't be offended next time if I don't say hello before I shoot. [ Shotgun cocks ] Geez! Hmm? Betsy : [ Breathing heavily ] Karl Weathers, that is a good way to get yourself shot! Your lesser half gave us a key, asked us to look out for you and the little one while he's gone. Do I strike you as someone who needs lookin' after? You do not. But he asked, so here we are. I'll sleep on the sofa. Sonny's already called dibs on the floor. Wait, did what? - I'd give you the sofa, see, except for my back. What's the matter with your back? It hurts when I sleep on the floor. Eggs are done. Pancakes are warmin' in the oven. You can fight me on "Are we gonna stay the night?" Or you and the kid can grab a plate and see why they call me "The Breakfast King of Loyola." [ Pan scraping ] Any word from grandma? I saw they took her-- the police. She's tough, though. It's not like they'd... And like I said, I was just-- you know, uh... Dodd told everybody on our side not to sell to me. Weed, you know? And so... I mean, sometimes a girl just wants to bust a nut, you know? How come you don't ask about Charlie? What? You ask about Floyd and your dad, but not about Charlie. Well, I mean, yeah, sure. How's he... State pen waitin' for trial. Well, we should, I mean, visit. Except, maybe Dodd-- Dad. What? His name's not Dodd to you. It's dad. Bullshit! After everything he did... That you seen him do to me, which you don't even want to think about what he does when you're not around. Not defendin' him, just tellin' you what he is to you. What's he to you? Where are we goin'? 
 
 [ Engine shuts off ] Come. No. That's not... Come. You're scarin' me. [ Seat belt clicks ] [ Grunting ] Stop. [ Breathes heavily ] He took my boy. What? He used his snake tongue and took him, walked him right out the door. That's what your dad is to me. Look, I didn't... It wasn't against you, what I did. I didn't mean for-- It doesn't matter what you mean. It's what you do. Sleepin' with the enemy. In France... [ Exhales sharply ] ...after the Second War... they shaved a lady's head for beddin' the Germans, and they ran her out of town... [ Squeals ] ...or worse. ♪ I can help. They trust me. I could-- I don't know. I could give them information, fake information, and you could-- Not our way. Yeah, but... I mean, they're-- How many dead now? Huh? They're kickin' our ass! That's on you. Your uncle... Your own grandfather. That's you. No. You... don't do that-- put this on me. Grandma wanted to negotiate, but Dodd-- dad-- wouldn't let her. He did this. He made it war. He's a snake, like you said-- a rat. He took Charlie, not me. [ Crying ] I was just... I'm the victim here! What was I supposed to do? [ Gasps ] Kneel down now. Please... Please... It's not... We're family. None of us are family anymore. [ Gun cocks ] [ Crying ] Please! [ Sobs ] [ Sobbing ] Please! Pl-please, just... banish me. Like you said, shave my head.
