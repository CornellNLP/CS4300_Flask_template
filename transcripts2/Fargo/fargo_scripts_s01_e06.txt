 (Man) 
 Erstwhile on  Fargo... 
 The blackmail... I'm gonna pay it.

 It's the book of Exodus. 
 God is watching, and He knows. 
 Knows what? 
 [Crunching] 
 Pick me up in an hour. 
 We'll get the money. 
 (Don) He's gonna pay a million dollars? 
 [Drill whirring] 
 Did you mean to lock me in here? 
 We got a big day tomorrow. 
 Get some rest. 
 That's Sam Hess. 
 You think this could be, like, an organized crime thing? 
 We're from Fargo. 
 You're gonna find him, right? 
 The guy who did it. 
 (Mr. Numbers) 
 I need a name. 
 Malvo! Malvo! 
 Lorne Malvo? 
 (Lester) He killed him. 
 He killed Hess. 
 [Peaceful Asian music] 
 [Water splashing] 
 [People speaking in native language] 
 (Jergen) So anyway, this freakin' guy-- 
 The women are in the box. 
 Eh? 
 Custom seal on. 
 [Laughter] 
 (Jergen) And he decides... Oy! 
 Soy sauce and another mai tai. 
 Mai tai? 
 Mai tai! 
 Anyhoo, he decides he's in love with one of them. 
 Yield so far 9,000 unique credit card numbers... 
 (Jergen) This big Russian girl...  with a credit limit of approximately 1.1 million... minus real estate, minus labor, minus R&D. 
 After the ship has sailed, he goes... 
 Sam Hess. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Assets deployed, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers. 
 Three days, plus lodging plus mileage. 
 You want the, uh... 
 Bottom line, they don't think... our guys... they said, doesn't look related to the business. 
 Could be extramarital on the wife's side. 
 So, uh, now, they're en route to a second location to apprehend who we, uh, think is responsible. 
 Dead. 
 What's that? 
 Not apprehend. 
 Dead. 
 Don't care extramarital. 
 Don't care not related. 
 Kill and be killed. 
 Head in a bag. 
 There's the message. 
 (Jergen) Of course, boss. Yeah. 
 (Carlyle) 1,900 units shipped by rail at a cost of 600 per, (Don) Good evening, ladies. Good eve... Welcome, ladies, to Turkish Delight. To Turkish Delight... [Coug... where your wish... your  wish  is our command. [Drill whirring, metallic clinking] Time to make the call. No. I mean, you know... maybe I don't wanna know, you know? 'Cause maybe something got broken there in the night, you know, something important, like trust. You know, maybe, uh, we need to revisit who gets how much here. What's in the bags? Look, okay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking 60/40, right? You know, with me getting, uh... you know, because, you know, am I or am I not doing all the, uh... What about the... the voice thingy there? [Sighs] [Distorted voice] Luke, I am your father. [Modulator falls] Ow. Stop screwing around. Wha... [Sighs] Luke... I think you broke it. [Exhales] So about that 60/40 split there... you know, I... Hey, why is there paper on the windows? Word for word. You really want me to say all this? [Clock ticking] [Man shouts] [Horn honks] [Grunts] [Gasps] [Phone rings] Yeah? (Don) [Distorted] Once upon a time, there was a little boy.  He was born in a field and raised in the woods. And he had nothing. In the winter the boy would freeze, and in the summer he would boil. He knew the name of every stinging insect. At night he would look at the lights in the houses, and he would want. Why was he outside and they in? Why was he so hungry and they fed? "It should be me," he said. And out of the darkness the wolves came, whispering. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. (Don) Gustafson parking garage, high noon. [Dial tone] [Door opens and closes] Well, did it sound like he's gonna pay? I... I don't know what that sounds like. So is the Greek the boy or... Give me that duffel over there, and I'll tell you. Hey, uh... [Laughs] what's with all the duct tape? [Grunts] (Norm on radio) I'm telling you, folks, things are shaping up to make this one of the worst blizzards in Minnesota history, the perfect storm or what have you. This is definitely one for the record books. (Woman on radio) That's right, Norm. And expect whiteouts and blizzard-like conditions. And since it's to move slightly down from Canada, also expect poor road conditions and even closures. So, folks, please avoid driving today unless you absolutely have to. Gosh, avoid going out... [Buzzer] [Sighs] Starting to come down out there. Storm of the century, they're saying. Is Greta here? No, she's at a friend's. Thought it would be safer. [Clears throat] Um, you didn't have to come. I was coming anyway. Told you last night. Just left a little earlier is all. [Chuckles] So, um, you really think this Malvo fella was at your apartment? Not at the apartment, outside. Uh, my neighbor, he does the watch. Said he saw this fella sitting in his car outside the apartment. May even have followed me here, I'm thinking. So the neighbor... Jewish fella... he gives the guy a warning, you know, a kinda "move along." Said the fella was real menacing in return. Had a police scanner, he said. Talked about how maybe he was gonna ... come back and kill the neighbor and his family. Aw, jeez. Did you call it in? Well, see, I don't think they'd believe me is the thing. I mean, not after, you know, I arrest the wrong fella, being what they think. So there's that. [Laughs] He get a plate number, your neighbor? Yeah, yeah. He, uh... I called it in. SUV of some type, company car. Which company? The grocery chain, you know. July in January. Phoenix Farms. Right. Which... [Sighs] This Malvo fella's saying he's a pastor, so I'm not sure of the connection there. Well, maybe we should drive over, see what they say. Yeah. Let me get changed. Morning, Mr. Creech. [Grunts] And how are we feeling there, Mr. Nygaard? Oh, yeah. Real good. Ready to go home. Well, now, that's up to him, I suppose. So how's your pain level on a scale of one to ten? Uh, yeah, not bad. So maybe a three? [Inhales] Hmm? Wh-what's with, uh... Why is there a police officer outside? Not for me to say, is it? [Laughs] [Clears throat] Okay, Mr. Creech, I'll be back to take you to radiology in ten minutes. [Grunts] [Ominous music] ♪ ♪ [Muttering inaudibly] (Chazz) I'm his brother, Chazz. Chazz Nygaard. [Door opens] Lester, it's me. Hey. What did you do? When? Come on, Lester. There's a deputy outside the door, for Pete's sake. I just... ah... cut my hand on a... some rusty nail. Not sure how that involves local law enforcement. They said you were there when the police chief got murdered. [Sighs] Well, heck. [Laughs] I think I'd remember that. Unless... I don't know, 'Cause things... You're lying. S-says who? That cop, the female, says you're a suspect. Suspect of what? Murder. For... for Pearl, the Chief. Even Sam Hess. [Laughs] That is crazy is what that is. I'm the victim! Me! He came to my house. They! I almost died. Did you tell her that? Don't lie to me! I took you in m... my house... This is... ...around my kid. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Classic. Cops can't figure out who did it, so they start throwing blame around. You said you were kidnapped. You call me in a meeting, said you were mixed up in something. That was... I told you I was just pranking you. No, you said you were in the trunk of a car, said a couple fellas grabbed you. What are you mixed up in, Lester? What the heck is going on? Chazz, I swear to you, this is all just a... Heck, you're my brother. You should be on my side. People are dead, Lester. Your own wife. A... a conspiracy, they're saying, like, like, like maybe you hired a fella to... to... To? What? Come on. [Inhales] Chazz, I swear to God. I did not do this. Anything. Well, they think you did or know who did, so... so you gotta give 'em something. Someone. If you want this to go away, you gotta give them someone. Chazz... buddy, come on. This is... You have gotta stand by me here. You've been a burden my whole life. I'm done. There's something wrong with you, Lester. There's... there's something missing. You're not right in the world. Chazz. Chazz. [Groaning] [Grunting] (Woman) Here's Mr. Creech's chart. Can you take that when you see him? Yeah, okay. Are we ready, Mr. Creech? [Groans] Okay, Mr. Creech. Someone will be out for you in a minute. [Moans] [Lester breathing heavily] [Grunts] [Grunts] [Exhales] [Car alarm beeps] [Beeps twice] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Horns honking] So he had a shotgun pellet in his hand this whole time? Lester? Yeah. Which means he wasn't knocked out in the basement like he said he was. So maybe... maybe he and Malvo weren't foes there at the end. Maybe they colluded on this whole thing. Hmm. Welcome to Phoenix Farms. Hiya. We're police officers. You sure are. This about the bugs? Sorry? The bugs. The... What do you... Locust? Er... wait. Maybe we're not supposed to tell people. Dave, are we telling people about the bugs? Is there a manager or someone we can talk to? Not sure anybody's in yet. Dave, anybody in the offices yet? Let me check. Mr. Cosmopolis to Customer Service. Mr. Cosmopolis to Customer Service. [Scanner beeping] Okay, then. Uh, I'm gonna leave my card. Deputy Solverson. We're here about a company car, who's driving it. The license number there on the back. Uh, when a manager gets in, just have him call. Okay, sure. Thanks. Thanks for stopping by! 
 
 So what do we do now then? I could use another cup of coffee. [Buzzer] [Tires screeching] (Stavros) Oh, God. Oh, my God. [Grunts] [Sighs] Oh, God. [Phone ringing] What? (Semenchko) Kid's getting restless. (Stavros) How's he doing? He's baffled, just like me. Did you make the drop? No. (Semenchko) It's not too late to get off the pot. It's a lot of damn money. It's not about the money. It's bigger than the... (Stavros) Thank you, God. (Semenchko) Than what? I know what I gotta do now. Give me an hour and head back. Tell the damn kid I love him. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm not gonna say that. Pack your sh1t! We're heading home. Was that my dad? Ticket, please. I changed my mind. I decided... God. He told me. He has different plans. God told you not to park here? No, no, no. I know what I have to do now. I didn't before. Well, sir, I gotta... It's $2 for the first 30 minutes, so... Son, you go to church? Yes, sir. Then open the goddamn gate. Your Lord demands it. [Beep, buzzer] [Police radio chatter] Two-faced. What's that? Oh. When someone's a liar, that's what you... you say. He's two-faced. Like, he's got one face for telling the truth and another for... I guess that's what bothers me the most, you know? Not the violence and the murders and all? Well, of course that. I mean... [Sighs] When a dog goes rabid, right, there's no mistaking it for a normal dog. Here we are, we're supposed to be... you know, us people, we're supposed to know better. To be better, you know?

[Radio chatter continues] [Muffled shouting] [Engine starts] [Indistinct chatter] [Muffled shouting] [Radio chatter continues] [Muffled] Hey! Hey! [Sobs, gags] [Mumbling] In case, uh, Stavros does call the cops, we wanna make sure they're too busy to respond. That's part one. Mm? Mm. Mm-mm. [Sobbing] [Grunting] Part two is... have you ever had Turkish Delight? It's disgusting. [Gun clicks] That's okay. I'd be insulted if you didn't try. (Man on radio) Roger that. One citation.

When, between the car and the house? So this fella gives away all his money and a kidney, and then he kills himself? (Gus) That's what he said. My neighbor. Why didn't the fella just go work for a charity? Got me. Probably close the roads soon, if you're gonna head back. Still gotta take a look at Lester's car. Maybe take another run at Phoenix Farms, I'm thinking. Try to get an ID on that company car. Don't much like this fella threatening people. Never wanted to be a cop, you know? I mean... [Clears throat] Some kids grow up thinking about it, but not me. And your dream was what then? You're gonna think it's funny, but... I always wanted to work for the post office and be a mailman. I like that you get to see the same people every day. Bring 'em that check they've been waiting for. Presents for Christmas. You know, be part of the community. But when I applied, they were on a hiring freeze. Then this pal from high school tells me the local PD's hiring, so took the bus downtown. Never thought they'd, you know... they'd take me. So why try? Well, you know, uh... Greta's mom passed, and she was the one with the paycheck, so... [Sirens blaring] Oh, jeez. I wonder what that's about. [Police radio chatter] [Sirens blaring] [Inhales] [Muffled shouting] [Police radio chatter] How bad? Sir, multiple shots fired, property damage. No injury reports at this time. And perps are still thought to be inside. Multiple? Unclear at this time. [Feedback] To the individual or individuals inside the house, this is Lieutenant Schmidt, Duluth Police Department. [Muffled grunting] I'm ordering you to throw out your weapon and come out with your hands up, or we start blasting. [Screaming] [Police radio chatter] Move. [Angelic choir music] (Man) Roger that. Tag Team is on the move, on the move. Divide and conquer on three. Divide and conquer on three. Over. [Men shouting] [Gunshot] [Grunts] (Man) Fire! Stay down! Take cover! They're shooting!
