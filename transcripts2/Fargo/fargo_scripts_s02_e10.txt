 Lou : This is a true story. 
 [ Clock ticking ] 
 The events depicted took place in Minnesota, North and South Dakota in 1979.

 Noreen : Feeling better, then? 
 Mm. 
 Doc says you had a reaction to those pills they gave ya. 
 Told them they were supposed to kill the cancer, but he says the pills may kill you first.

 Is Lou back? 
 No. 
 And no word, either. 
 Something to eat? 
 Oh, God, no.

 Teacher : Yes, Molly. 
 [ Device beeping ] 
 I dreamt of a magical future filled with wondrous devices where everything you could ever want would be available in one amazing place. 
 Oh. 
 All right. [ Clears throat ] 
 Here we go. 
 Ready? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 Just one more.

 Do you know what the definition of the word "sovereignty" is? 
 What am I? 
 The professor from "Gilligan's Island"? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Sovereignty is absolute power and authority. 
 Like a king? 
 Exactly. 
 Which is who I am-- your king.

 It's America, brother. 
 We don't do kings. 
 Oh, we do. 
 We do. 
 We just call them something else. 
 See, today is my coronation day. 
 And on coronation day, I've always believed a new king should start his reign with an act of kindness. 
 Right on. 
 And an act of cruelty. 
 That way, your subjects know that you're capable of both-- 
 God and monster.

 Sign me up for the first one. 
 Problem is Wilma works in the kitchen. 
 The Indian? 
 Right. 
 She has already received my kindness-- to wit, a brand-new car and all the money that was in that cabinet you were searching.

 There was this-- there was this couple-- this French-- and they were on the run... from the Nazi, I gu-- uh, and... [ Sighs ] and the husband or whatever he was, he-- he got shot, just like you. 
 But then they hid out in this--

 No! 
 There's no smoke. We need to check on Ed.

 No.

 No, the Indian got away, okay?

 Kicked in the door-- us. 
 No, he's here. 
 The Indian was never in the building. 
 No, he was. Ed will tell ya. 
 No.

 [ Birds chirping ] 
 Mm. 
 Noreen : Mornin'. 
 Is Lou back? 
 No. 
 S-so... is it...? 
 Do you feel it? 
 Feel what? 
 My aunt lost her bosom to cancer. 
 Said it felt like somebody took a hot poker and put it through her heart. 
 No. 
 Not like that. 
 Not yet. 
 You know how sometimes you get a peach from the bowl and one side is ripe and yellow and the other is black and moldy? 
 That-- that's the only way I can think to describe it. 
 Camus says knowin' we're gonna die makes life absurd. 
 Well, I don't know who that is. 
 But I'm guessing he doesn't have a 6-year-old girl. 
 He's French. 
 Ugh, I don't care if he's from Mars. 
 Nobody with any sense would say something that foolish. 
 We're put on this earth to do a job. 
 And each of us gets the time we get to do it. 
 And when this life is over and you stand in front of the Lord... 
 Well, you try tellin' him it was all some Frenchman's joke. 
 Do ya think... 
 Is there any chance I could be tried federal? 
 Why? 
 I thought-- well, maybe I could serve my time in California. 
 There was this news report on the TV about how there's this penitentiary just north of San Francisco that looks out on the bay. 
 Doesn't that sound nice? 
 Maybe see a pelican. 
 We'll see what we can do. 
 I was there at the end, you know? 
 After the war, when Saigon fell, on the USS  Kirk  patrolling the coast. 
 And when the country went, it went fast. 
 And we had, like, you know, 24 hours to get everybody out. 
 And not just Americans, but... our allies, the South Vietnamese, all packed onto boats and helicopters. 
 We stood on the deck and waved them in. 
 And one by one, they'd land, unload, and then we'd push the whirlybirds into the sea. 
 The damndest thing. 
 But then, this Chinook comes. 
 And those things-- you can't just land one on a ship this size. 
 So we wave them off. 
 But the pilot's got his whole family inside, and he's running out of fuel, so it's now or never. 
 So he hovers over the deck. 
 People start... jumping-- scared or not-- onto the ship. 
 There's a baby-- literally a-a tiny baby-- and the mother just-- just drops him. 
 And one of my boys... like catching a ball, just sticks out his hands. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 So, now everybody's out, and I'm thinking, "How the heck is this pilot"-- right?-- 
 "How's he gonna get out?" 
 But he maneuvers off the port bow, and he hovers there for the longest time doing, you know, what we learned later-- uh, takin' off his flight suit. 
 And somehow he rolls the bird on its side, and just before it hits the water, he jumps. 
 6,000 pounds of angry helicopter parts flyin' all around him. 
 And somehow he makes it. [ Chuckles ] 
 How'd he do that? I-- 
 What are you sayin'? 
 Your husband, he said he was gonna protect his family no matter what. 
 And I acted like I didn't understand, but... I do. 
 It's the rock we all push-- men. 
 We call it our burden, but it's really our privilege. 
 I never meant for any of this to happen. 
 You know? 
 Not to Ed. 
 Not to anybody. 
 I just wanted to be someone. 
 Well, you're somebody now. 
 No, see? 
 I wanted to choose, be my own me, not be defined by someone else's expec-- 
 And then, that guy-- that stupid guy-- walked out into the-- [ Sighs ] 
 Why'd he have to do that? 
 You mean the victim? 
 No. That's not fair. 
 'Cause I'm a victim, too. 
 Was a victim first, before him. 
 Victim of what? 
 It's... 
 You wouldn't understand. You're a man. 
 It's a lie, okay-- that you can do it all-- be a wife and a mother and this self-made career woman, like there's 37 hours in a day. 
 And then, when you can't, they say it's you. 
 "You're faulty," like-- like-- like you're inferior somehow. 
 And... like-- like, if you could just get your act together until you're half mad with--

 And so... great empires fall and are forgotten. 
 You're thinking, "Why 'Tripoli'?" 
 Well, Tripoli, not to be confused with Levantine Tripoli in the country of Lebanon, was founded in Libya in the Seventh Century by the Phoenicians, _ then was conquered by the Romans. 
 And then by the Spanish, and then by the Turks. _ 
 You see where I'm going. 
 I need a face man. 
 His details are inside. 
 I'm assuming you want more than just a skin peel-- something structural-- a whole new man, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes. 
 What'll you do then, I wonder? 
 Join a-a new empire? 
 Maybe start one of my own.

 And I got-- I got-- I got to thinkin' about-- about miscommunication. 
 Like, how-- isn't that the root of it? 
 Conflict, war-- does-- doesn't it all come down to-- to language? Right? 
 The-- the words we say and the words we hear, which aren't always the same thing. 
 So, I thought, you know, what if there was one language-- a u-- a universal language of symbols? 
 'Cause pictures, to my mind, are-- are-- are clearer than words. 
 So that's what that is... 
 Mm. 
 ...in your office? 
 You're making your own language. 
 Well, it sounds crazy when you say it out loud, I know. 
 But... you know, when we see a-a-a box with a roof on it-- well, everyone knows that means "Home," right? 
 You know, and my-- my 6-year-old granddaughter, she draws a heart. 
 It means love. No question. 
 Anyway... that's where I started, you know, with simple ideas. 
 And-- and the more I worked on it, the more it became all I could think about. 
 You're a good man. 
 Well, I don't know about that, but... I like to think I got good intentions.

 And all the ships at sea.
