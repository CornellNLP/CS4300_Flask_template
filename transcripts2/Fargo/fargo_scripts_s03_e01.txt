 [Emmit] Honestly Buck it's a little embarrassing.    
 I mean we called the number.    
 They said if there was ever a problem we should call the number, and well we called it.    
 And?    
 A series of clicks and buzzers.    
 A series of--    
 Clicks and buzzers.    
 That's what we got, which--    
 Couldn't even leave a message.    
 No message possible.    
 So we thought--    
 We thought get Buck back in here, after all he vouched for him.    
 Well now, let's be, let's call a spade a spade.    
 I don't know him, don't vouch for him.    
 I was just a conduit for information.    
 Like you said "Buck we tried all the normal channels, and we just need a bridge loan to--"    
 (laughs)    
 It was last year for Pete's sake.    
 I met him at the Shriner's.    
 Sure, okay then.    
 Everything went great when we met with the broker,     
 Mr. Ehrmantraut, if I'm not a--     
 Right, Rick Ehrmantraut.     
 I got his card in my--     
 And now we're in the black again, so we called the number to arrange payback and clicks and buzzers.     
 Maybe there's another number, we're thinking.     
 Another number where we can at least leave a darn message.     
 It's a lot of money.     
 A heck of lot.     
 And it's just sitting there on the books which--     
 Can't have that.     
 Okay then well, thanks for coming in.     
 Of course.     
 And did you think about what I asked?     
 The widow Goldfarb she wants to meet.     
 - The who? 
- I was gonna tell ya.     
 She's the so called storage queen, sniffing around for a possible silent partner type arrangement.     
 [Buck] Seems like the real deal.     
 Money to burn.     
 Where was she two years ago?     
 (people clapping)     
 Friends, friends and Dave.     
 (people laughing)     
 I'm not lying when I tell ya,     
 I still remember the first date.     
    years ago.     
 Took her to Fjords in St. Paul, my Stella.     
 I brought her a lobster the size of a car.     
 Cost me two weeks wages at the Red Robin, but it was worth it.     
 And so over shellfish she says "So, where do you live?"     
 You know, just making conversation and I tell her the address     Monroe.     
 And she gets this funny look on her face.     
 And she says "Which apartment?"     
 So I say "  ."     
 And now the look gets even funnier and she says--     
 I say "What are the odds?"     
 I lived in that same apartment for three and a half years, I still had the key.     
 (people laughing)     
 [Emmit] Of course she never told me that part.     
 So I come home a week later and what the heck?     
 She'd moved in!     
 (people laughing)     
 And now somehow it's    years later and here we are.     
 And we've got Grace and her husband Dennis.     
 And life has been to us, more than good.     
 - Okay. 
- Raise a glass to my Stella.     
 Still lovely as the day we met.
