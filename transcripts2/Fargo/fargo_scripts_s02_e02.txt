 Charlie : Jeremy Kleiner up in Winnipeg writes... "Feel better, boss man." 
 That's nice. 
 And then, uh... Carter Bunch says, "Keep fighting, you old cuss. You'll outlive us all." 
 Indian Joe sent p0rn. 
 Get these to the chinaman-- the usual disbursement. 
 [ Whispers indistinctly ] 
 Get your dad and uncles. 
 We need to talk. 
 [ Grinding ] 
 You finish your chores? 
 Yes, sir, I've been helping grandma with the bank. 
 Uh, she sent me to get you. 
 Wants us all together up in the house. 
 Dodd's inside. 
 [ Dog barks in distance ] 
 Dodd : Fought in the trenches in France-- World War I. 
 He was an artillerieschuetzen, my granddad, a gunner. 
 Blasted mustard gas at the Allies. 
 [ Chuckling ] Had them dancing like poisoned rats. 
 Brits caught him in a raid, hung him by his thumbs for six days straight. 
 So this, what we're doing, this is nothing. 
 Are you listening to me? 
 Is he listening to me? 
 Cut off his ears. 
 Wake him up. 
 He's dead, I think. 
 Weak.

 Who were the goons? 
 Kansas City. 
 They want to buy us out. 
 So they came to you, then? 
 They came to see your father, but he's not well. 
 So they talked to me as his surrogate. 
 I should've been there. 
 Geez, dad. Don't be such a baby. 
 Shut up. 
 She shouldn't be in here. 
 She's old enough. 
 I told her to stay. 
 She's a girl. 
 And girls grow up to be women... and change boys' diapers. 
 Where's your little brother? 
 Rye? Haven't seen him. 
 Who knows with that kid? Probably neck deep in some pussy. 
 [ Silverware clinks ] 
 With a girl, you know. 
 What's the offer? 
 He talks to you. Where is he? 
 Said he had things to do out of town. 
 I saw him yesterday. 
 What things? 
 What's the offer? 
 The world's becoming more corporate-- this was their pitch to me. 
 And in this new world, there's no room for family business. 
 So war. 
 They're offering to buy the whole operation, then pay us to run it. 
 Bottom line. 
 Bottom line-- very little changes on the ground. 
 We may actually earn more. 
 But instead of running it, we report to them. 
 To who? 
 Kansas City. 
 Balls. What'd you say? 
 I said, "Thank you very much. I'll consult with my partners." 
 Meaning grandpa. 
 No. 
 The stroke. 
 Your father's not in a lucid state. 
 Nor will he be... possibly ever. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying your grandpa built this business, but he's no longer capable of running it. 
 We should have a moment of silence, maybe. 
 As new boss, I say we tell these Kansas City schvantzes to go to hell in the fast lane. 
 Now, hold on. 
 What? 
 You think it should be you? 
 No, stupid. Mom. 
 Boss can't be a woman. 
 Who says? 
 Think about it. 
 [ Clank ] 
 Mom's the one with ties to Winnipeg. 
 History with Carter B and the Solkerk crew. 
 Suppliers trust her. 
 Should be mom. 
 Hell, yes. I vote for grandma. 
 Shut up. We're not voting. 
 I'm oldest. 
 I'm boss. 
 End of story. 
 Give us a minute. 
 Not you. 
 Sit. 
 Eat something. 
 This moment... 
 How things go in the next few weeks-- will decide-- 
 That's why I-- 
 Let me finish. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Your grandfather left the ashes of the Weimar Republic and came to this country to build a name for himself. 
 He built an empire from a shoe-shine box. 
 And then, and only then, did he send for your father. 
 Ma, I know the story. 
 No, you don't. 
 'Cause if you did, you'd know that you are just a small part of it. 
 That's what an empire is. 
 It's bigger than any son or daughter. 
 Eat. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 I'm your mother. You will eat with me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Your time will come. 
 It will, but this isn't it. 
 And if you stand by me now, I promise you that as soon as this crisis is over, I'll hand you your legacy, and I'll turn my thoughts to the grave. 
 Now, we need to find Rye. 
 Can you do that for me? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Wherever he is, whatever he's doing, bring him home. 
 [ Dramatic music plays ] 
 If you're a betting man, I'm saying. 
 Well, I think history's proven people of the Germanic persuasion don't surrender easy. 
 But you can kill them. 
 Unless the woman, being a woman-- maybe we can scare her. 
 No. 
 I think we cut a deal with one of the sons. 
 The youngest maybe-- Rye. 
 The olders are-- Well, you know, how a lobster's got a pincher claw and a crusher claw? 
 Which one's which? 
 Pardon? 
 Which son is which claw? 
 You know what? Forget it. 
 I don't want anything to do with your facacta metaphor. 
 Management says acquire the territory, we acquire it. 
 Whether that's cash down or sending bodies to the morgue, that's up to the Krauts. 
 First Gerhardt to switch sides gets a shiny, red apple. 
 Dispatcher : No, I know. 
 I know, uh-huh. 
 No. No, Sheriff says it's a local matter. 
 Yeah.

 Did you get some sleep? 
 Oh, a couple hours. 
 You know, went pretty late. 
 Papa, papa! 
 What? What? 
 What can I make ya? 
 Uh, eggs would be good. Not a bother. 
 I could do oatmeal, maybe. 
 Tell me a story. 
 Something about the smell of eggs right now... 
 Okay, coffee's fine. 
 Uh, okay, uh... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Once upon a time, there was, uh, an oyster. 
 What's an oyster? 
 It's a shellfish. 
 Fish? 
 Yeah, close enough. Lou sleeping? 
 Uh, he had a call with the brass. 
 Should be down soon. 
 Apparently, one of your victims was a judge. 
 A judge, huh? 
 Uh-huh. 
 The older woman. 
 Out of North Dakota. 
 Huh. 
 Papa! 
 Hello. Yes? 
 What's the story? 
 What story? 
 About the oyster. 
 Oh, uh, yeah. 
 Sorry, Lieutenant called. 
 Judge, huh? 
 Ah, Betsy told ya? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, a municipal judge up in Fargo. 
 Huh. Oh, yeah. 
 One day, the, uh... [Sighs] 
 The oyster got caught in the net. 
 Fisherman pulled him up, all set to eat him. 
 Uh, except, he happened to have his-- his daughter in the boat, and she said... 
 "Daddy, how would you feel if I peeled the roof of your house and ate you?" 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Was that you? 
 It was. 
 That's the story of how your mom and me came to eat hot dogs for dinner once again. 
 Hey, so, knowing she's a judge, that change anything? 
 Well, you know, I guess we got to ask ourselves, was this judge just in the wrong place at the wrong time, or was this whole mess about her? 
 [ Dramatic music plays ] 
 [ Body thuds ] 
 Gonna be late for work, huh? 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, I don't think I'm going in today. 
 Well, got to keep up appearances, though, right? 
 You said. 
 Geez, hon, your eye. 
 Aw, no, it doesn't hurt. 
 It just-- it looks bad. 
 Well, maybe I should stay home, too. 
 No, you should go. 
 Just tell them you hit your head or something.

 There's to much stuff to do here.

 Are you with me? 
 Good. 
 Bear's thrown in with mom, and that's his loss.

 Gloria : A Desperado, I heard. 
 The Sheriff thinks a pair of them gunned down those poor people at The Waffle Hut one after another in cold blood. 
 I mean, first Watergate, and now this? 
 What's the world coming to? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Sorry, Mrs. Colson. The car wouldn't start. 
 I'll ditch the coat and get your squared away, okay? 
 Big night? 
 Huh? 
 Got a hangover? 
 Oh, no, it's, uh, just a migraine. 
 You talk to Ed? 
 Did I... 
 About the seminar-- next weekend. 
 Got us a room at the Southnik Hotel. 
 Oh, yeah. I don't know. 
 It's a lot of money, and we're saving up right now so Ed can buy the butcher shop. 
 What I'm hearing is you think your husband's more important than you-- his needs. 
 No, I just... 
 We got a plan, you know? 
 The word "we" is a castle, hon, with a moat and a drawbridge. 
 And you know what gets locked up in castles? 
 Dragons? 
 Princesses. 
 Don't be a prisoner of "we." 
 Take the seminar. 
 It'll give you a  key to the castle. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, hey, you don't know what happened to all the TP, do ya? 
 The what's that? 
 Had a case of TP in the back last week. 
 Somebody took it. 
 Lou : Yes, sir, I know I said it was a local matter last night, but I slept on it, you know? 
 And, uh, given the level of violence and with no apparent suspects and, uh... and the fact that one of the victims was a judge... 
 Right, in North Dakota, which means you're gonna have all kinds of interstate issues. 
 So, my thought is, uh, you know, all-- all the more reason for me... 
 Yes, sir. 
 [ Pen clicks ] 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Well, I'll coordinate with Sheriff Larsson and head up to Fargo first thing tomorrow. 
 Yep. 
 [ Car doors close ] 
 Skip : Yeah, I know. 
 We-- You said all that, but my point... 
 What I'm trying to... 
 I've got the money, see? 
 I've got... 
 Uh... I-- I mean, I will have. 
 So you just need to hold the Selectrics for me until, uh... 
 So just... hold them, okay? 
 Don't... 
 And I'll call you back.

 That's okay. We're not really customers. 
 Okay, well... 
 Rye Gerhardt. 
 Is that your name, or...? 
 I mean, geez, I-- I met the guy, of course, uh, once or.. twice. 
 Are ya... 
 Did you need a character reference, or...? 
 [ Chuckles ] That's good. 
 I like that-- "a character reference." 
 How about you just tell us where he is? 
 Seeing as he works for you and all. 
 Well, isn't that what you told Big Jim Suggs? 
 Over at the Pig 'N Poke yesterday. 
 Had a few drinks.

 Kids today love to talk on the phone, but I'm a big believer in correspondence, friendly or otherwise. 
 If you've got a complaint-- it's my motto-- put it in writing. 
 For instance, last week, I bought one of those new automatic coffee makers at Sears. 
 You know, the one with the clock inside. 
 And the thing is-- pardon my French-- a real piece of sh1t. 
 So what do I do? 
 [ Knuckles crack ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 Dear General Electric, the coffee maker that I bought at Sears on 11 March makes a noise when it's brewing that sounds like a fat man having a heart attack.

 Is this why our once-great nation is going down the crapper?

 We're just passing though town on our way to points south. 
 Thought we'd stop for some waffles. 
 Gale's idea. 
 Heard you had some real good ones around here. 
 So you can imagine our surprise when we find the place closed and, apparently, the scene of a crime. 
 What size shoes you boys wear? 
 Now, that is a truly odd question. 
 Last time I checked, I was a 10. 
 Boys? 
 Now, I'm gonna go ahead and guess the boys are an 11 and not a 2, which would make them toddlers. 
 Now, unless there's some law been broken, think it's time for us to be on our way. 
 I promised the boys' wives I'd have them home for supper, and I am, if nothing else, a man of my word. 
 Okay. 
 I got your names and your plate number. 
 I'm gonna radio ahead and make sure you make it out of State. 
 If not, I'm gonna put out an APB and have you boys rounded up. 
 And then we'll talk again.

 I do. 
 And isn't that a minor miracle?

 This was on the Bo De river, seventy... four. 
 Ah. 
 So I'm on the wheel. 
 This kid comes out.

 Man : No one would have believed, in the last years of the 19th century, that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space. 
 No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized as someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. 
 Few men even consider the possibility of life on other planets. 
 And yet, across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this earth with envious eyes, and, slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us.
