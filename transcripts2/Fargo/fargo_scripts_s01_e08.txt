 Mr. Nygaard? 
 Oh, you betcha. 
 [Chuckles] 
 She's a beaut. 
 Yeah. 
 Got the low water feature but don't skimp on torque. 
 Am I taking the old one? 
 Yeah, if that's... 
 They said on the phone it'd be no problem. 
 Oh, sure. 
 It's no problem. 
 The T-160, huh? 
 Mm. 
 Yeah. 
 Jeez. 
 See why you're trading her in. 
 She's a real lemon. Motor mount. Chinese used plastic screws. Bet she bucked like a bronco. You do not know the half of it. Stopped making 'em pretty quick. Recalled, I think. Surprised to see her, truth be told. You'd be better off washing your clothes between two rocks, you know what I mean? [Delivery man continues chattering indistinctly] [Cheerful whistling begins again] ♪ ♪ They got Chazz up at Faribault till the trial. Gordo's at Red Wing, which is... Well, you know, at least they're close. His lawyer thinks we can plea it down to probation, time served. For murder? No, Gordo... Oh. On the gun charge. Yeah. Chazz? Well, good riddance. Don't care what that man gets. No, sir. Not after what he did. Killing my wife, you mean? Oh. Well, yeah. Yeah, of course that. But also... Well, I mean, look at me. I was Miss Hubbard County, for Pete's sake. You don't cheat on Miss Hubbard County. I just don't believe it, you know? I mean, just three weeks ago, we were sitting around the table... eating ham. And now Gordo's having his night terrors again. Plus, we have to sell everything to pay the legal bills. Did you know... Chazz bought a time share in a boat? Well, I didn't even know that was a thing. Yeah, it's a thing. So if there's anything from the house you want...  you know, like I was thinking maybe Chazz's hunting gear...  I boxed it up for you. Not sure it's anything you want. Oh, sure. That'd... that'd be fine. Thank you. Well... [Clears throat] Listen. If there's anything I can do. Oh, Lester, you are so sweet. I am the one who should be saying that after what he did to you, my husband. Ooh, what'd you get? New washer. The old one... Well, I had to get rid of everything from the basement, you know, on account of all the... You deserve it, Lester. All good things, you deserve. [Variation on Beethoven's  Ninth Symphony] ♪ ♪ Back to it, then? Looks like. Doc cleared me for duty, so... Ooh. More flowers came for you from Duluth. A smarter man would think you were being wooed. I don't know what you're talking about. Put 'em up where we can see 'em at least. [Chuckles] So you got a strategy on this Lester thing? Well, I'm just gonna walk in and say, "Bill, we..." If you think it's best. The direct approach. Your point being? Got no point. Okay. Bye, dad. Chief, are you busy? What's that? Said, "Are you busy?" Got a request for your attendance. Can it wait? I just ate an omelet. Waiting for it to digest. Oh, yeah? What kind? Well, it was mushrooms and cheese. Sally make it? [Chuckles] Yeah. She wrapped it in tinfoil to keep it warm. Molly needs you is the thing. Asked me to see if you'd come down to the staff room. She's back already? Yep. Hmm. Thought I had another day. All right. Let's go see what we're gonna do today. There she is, the gunfighter. Hey, Chief. Nice collage. You take up basket weaving too in your downtime? Yeah, it's just some loose ends I wanted to... Molly, before you... [Clears throat] I want you to know... I'm not too proud to say I was wrong on the Lester case. I had the wrong idea. I thought it was a drifter thing, which was the wrong way to go, clearly. But, you know, some good police work, and we caught the guy, so... [Chuckles] Well, that... that's the problem, actually, is that you're still... [Sighs] Still what? Wrong. I'm sorry... I mean, no disrespect. It's just... it doesn't make any sense. I mean... I mean, the brother? With all the things we know are true? I've been lying in bed just thinking about this. And for example, okay, if it was the brother, then how do we explain the phone call from Lester's to the motel... Molly, darn it now, just... You can't keep going over... It's time. You got to let it go. We did our job. The brother Nygaard killed the wife. And he cornered and shot the Chief. And Lester was covering for him on account of the brother thing, which explains... We had drinks to celebrate. I had a Greyhound and Knutson had... what was it with the cherry? A Rob Roy. Rob Roy. Yeah. You had a few of them, if I'm not mistaken. [Clears throat] What about the Hess case? What about it? It's still open, yeah? Yeah, no. See... we're checking to see if the hooker had a boyfriend. Jealous type, you know? Didn't like her getting tooled by every Tom, Dick, and Jane, but otherwise... Who's working that now? Terry. Well, that's good. Yeah. Except Terry doesn't always know which end of a mop to use to wash the floor. He's not the brightest bulb. I'll give you that. But he's soldiering through. Well, good for him. Except I'm back now. No. Chief, please. No, Molly, Deputy. Now, I would give it to you, I would, except we both know in two days, I'd be back in this room with you pointing at names on that whiteboard and me chewing my tie. Just please, Chief, for Pete's sake, I've got evidence that puts Lester Nygaard in a room with a known killer on the day of the Hess murder, and then the next night, Lester called the guy. He called him at the motel. Look, ... you can't... That's just how it is sometimes. Life. You know, you go to bed unsatisfied. They're calling lottery numbers on the TV, and you get the first few, and already in your mind, you're buying a jet or a fjord or whatever, but it's just not meant to be. It's just not meant to be. Hey, look. We're all real glad to have you back, okay? You're a heck of a police officer. Tell her about the cake. The guys are gonna have a cake for you later. Try to look surprised. It's... It's really something. It's got an assault rifle on top made of frosting, which I don't know how they do that. But... [Chuckles] [Whimsical ukulele music] [Seagulls calling] [Waves crashing] [Keyboard clicking] Heya, Lester. I like your tie. Thank you. I got it online. Oh, yeah? Uh-huh. Oh. Jacket too. I was a bit nervous about it at first. Had to send the jacket back once, actually. It was too big in the arms. Well, I think you look terrific. [Laughs] Oh. And, um... I was thinking of making some chili on Saturday night if you maybe wanted to join me. Where is he? You son of a bitch. I am gonna bust your balls. You want me to do it, ma? Yeah, ma, want us to? Shut up! I am gonna bust your balls. Now, Mrs. Hess, what can I do for you? Don't you "Mrs. Hess" me. I was picking your pubes out of my teeth 12 hours ago, and then I get this? That is... This is highly irregular. I'll make some calls. Liar. Mrs. Hess. Liar. You knew the whole time. No, no. Missus... Gina, this is... This... Listen. I'm gonna make some calls. Like I said... I was speaking to the guy from mid claims just yesterday. He didn't mention a single thing... I let you come inside of me. Ma, that's really gross. Yeah, ma, don't talk like that. Come on, we don't need to bring that into the conversation. You are gonna get me my money, you little sh1t. $2 million. You've got until the end of the day. Show him what we'll do. Jesus. All right. All right. Sorry, loser. [Laughs] Me too. [Both grunting] Yeah. So are we calm? Are we calm? Now, here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna make some calls, like I said. Because this is the first that I've... But if it's true... If Sam did miss some payments, then, well, they're within their rights to... I think we might have a problem here. That was...

What Agent Pepper is trying to say, the syndicate spree killing, yes, technically, we were there outside in our car while it was... But you have to... You have to see it as a positive, uh, because it leaves us... myself and Agent Budge... it leaves us... Poised. That's the word we like. Poised to catch this guy. Because, sir, first of all, we got this photo from an ATM across the street. It captures our... A single individual who's clearly armed and about to... Now, the photo's not great, but I... We were thinking definitely white male. Sir. Listen, sir. This is where you work now. (Budge) We are highly effective, highly trained-- I have a commendation. A commendation? That's your... Okay.

I mean, 22 people did get killed, and we were sitting in the car like a couple of... Yeah, we're okay. We're all right. [Ball bouncing] [Indistinct PA announcement] [Heart monitor beeping] [Urinating] [Choking] [Heart monitor beeping] Never heard of a deaf hit man. Carolina Murphy had his tongue cut out by an Indian back in the '80s. He worked a little after that but never quite the same. And Buzz Mead... you know Buzz? He was born with just a socket. Used to take his glass eye out at parties and drop it in his drink. He was a sh1t shot, though. Now, the other fella, your partner, he could hear just fine. We had a kind of little chat before I cut his throat. You're unemployed now, by the way, in case you don't read the papers. [Shouts] I watched a bear once. His leg was in a steel trap. It chewed through bloody bone to get free. It was in Alaska. Died about an hour later facedown in a stream. But it was on his own terms, you know? You got close. Closer than anybody else. I don't know if it was you or your partner, but look. If you still feel raw about things when you heal up, come see me. [Door opens] [Door closes] [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Just me and Bill, right? Slow night. And the call comes in. He don't like when I tell this story. Heard you got some flowers. [Scoffs] Yeah. Some people do love to flap their lips. More than once, what I heard. Well, there's a suitor is all I'm prepared to say. Vern was so bad at courtship. [Laughs] One time he gave me a bouquet of poison ivy. Picked it himself. [Chuckles] He's up in Duluth, my gentleman. Has a daughter. What's his name? They call him Sergio. He's a pirate, I think. Very funny, you. Well... [Clears throat] Yours is the one with the icing clip. And, Ida, your frosting comes from the barrel, I think. Good to have everyone together again, don't you think? It's like one big, happy, uh... Which is good, is all. [Chuckles] I wanted to thank you for catching the guy. [Chuckles] Not me. I was in bed. Stop. You were in the hospital with a bullet. No. Bill may have made the arrest, but we both know who did the real work. He's not convicted yet. I mean, not all the evidence... For me, there are still... But yeah, no, I'm glad it's behind us.

In the cafeteria? Or is it meat loaf? No, I'm saying that you and I both agree that the file room minus one file is still the file room. Now, say you took another one out and then another. If the file room minus one file is still a file room, and you keep subtracting one at a time, you could end up with zero files... I'm saying, logically... or even negative files, and it would still-- How do you have negative files? No, I'm just... Logically, I'm saying. Except no one's taking files. They just bring more.

(Woman on TV) No, of course he wasn't seeing things. Well, I'm going to sleep. (Woman on TV) Just as I told you, Inspector.
