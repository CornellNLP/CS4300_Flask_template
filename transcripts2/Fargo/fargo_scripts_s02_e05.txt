 Erstwhile on Fargo... 
 We need to find Rye, bring him home. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 You know him, do you? 
 Ed? Oh, yeah. He's a butcher. 
 I ran over him. Hit and run. 
 Lou : His name was Rye Gerhardt, and his family hurts people for money. 
 If you did something, you made a mistake, you panicked, you maybe covered it up, now is the time to say. 
 But that window's closin', and you may already be dead. 
 We're asking you to leave. 
 Management says acquire the territory, we acquire it. 
 Whether that's cash down or sending bodies to the morgue, that's up to the krauts. 
 [ Cocks rifle ] 
 [ Thud ] 
 Joe Bulo says hi. 
 Joe : Your counter has been rejected, and now we're lowering our price by $2 million. 
 Anything other than unconditional surrender, and we'll wipe every last Gerhardt off the face of the Earth. 
 [ Whistling ] 
 [ Wind howling ] 
 Ronald Reagan : My father was a salesman. 
 Ladies shoes. 
 It's fair to say during the Depression that he struggled, like a lot of people on the Rock River in Dixon, Illinois. 
 But I've never been one to focus on life's downs. 
 I was a lifeguard in high school, and where some saw a drowning man, I saw a life to save... which I did, 77 times in 5 years. 
 [ Applause ] 
 They put up a plaque after I became governor, and, uh... Well, I'd have to say I'm prouder of that than just about anything. 
 [ Applause ] 
 I'm gonna call you Chief Wigwam, you bring that thing. 
 Any man can fire a gun. 
 The longbow is an art. 
 [ Closes truck gate ] 
 [ Rifles cocking ] 
 [ Typewriter keys clack ] 
 [ Car door closes ] 
 Man : Well, you're all set. 
 [ Men speaking indistinctly ] 
 Everything okay? 
 Just a little housekeeping. 
 Let's kill ourselves some deer. 
 Reagan : My friends, we have in our lifetime fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this Earth. 
 [ Typewriter keys clack ] 
 But if you look around, you may not see many signs of that dignity. 
 Crime is up. Jobs are scarce. 
 You have to stand in a line just to fill up your car. 
 [ Speaking inaudibly ] 
 [ Rattles ] 
 How? 
 Run down in the street and finished off at a second location. 
 You're sure? 
 Who? 
 Butcher. 
 A butcher? 
 Down in Luverne. 
 Like the law said, Rye followed the judge, shot up the place. 
 Got killed after. 
 Floyd : By a butcher? 
 That's his name. 
 Butcher of Luverne. That's what they call him. 
 Contract man outta... outta Kansas City. 
 [ Voice breaks ] I wanna hear it from him. 
 Kid was marked probably the day he left. 
 Butcher ambushed him after the judge tried to grab him, probably. 
 He got in some licks. 
 Things went downhill. 
 Why? 
 Ma, it's war. 
 You said yourself. 
 They're jackals, came here talking about a settlement. 
 Meanwhile, the kid is already dead. 
 I'm asking  him. 
 He's a bargaining chip, yeah? Rye. 
 Kansas City thinks if they grab him up, then come to you with that leverage, you'll sell for sure. 
 Instead, they kill him, they panic, cover it up, knowing once you find out, sale's dead, no question. 
 See? 
 Reagan : The citizens of this great nation want leadership, yes, but not a man on a white horse, demanding obedience to his command. 
 They want someone who believes they can begin the world over again... 
 Joe : I'm saying, the age of the local mom and pop is over, and what comes next, Commissioner, the era of big business, is gonna make a lot of people very rich. 
 Armbruster : Oh, I like the sound of that. 
 And you're saying you can deliver leaders on the state and local level? 
 [ Chuckles ] Joe, there's not a politician in this state wouldn't take my call in the middle of dinner. 
 Well, then, you and me are really gonna be pals. 
 ...a leader who will unleash their great strength and remove the roadblocks government has put in their way. 
 [ Applause ] 
 Watch and learn, Joe. 
 I believe this nation hungers for a spiritual revival... 
 [ Bow string stretching ] 
 [ Whispers ] Watch and learn. 
 [ Gunshots ] 
 Uhh! 
 Man : Move! Gerhardt! 
 [ Gunfire, men grunting ] 
 ...that we, all of us, hunger to, once again, see honor placed above political expediency... 
 [ Gunshot, rifle cocks ] 
 ...to see government once again the protector of liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege. 
 Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded... 
 [ Whimpering ] 
 Religion, education, and above all, family. 
 [ Continues whimpering ] 
 [ Cheers and applause ] 
 [ Gunshot ] 
 [ Cocks rifle ] 
 [ Cheers and applause continue ] 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Gunshot in distance ] 
 [ Gunshots ] 
 [ Rifle cocks ] 
 [ Gunshot ] 
 Aah! 
 Wait. 
 Uhh! 
 [ Knife slices ] 
 Uhh! 
 [ Gurgling ] 
 We, who are privileged to be Americans, have had a rendezvous with destiny since the moment in 1630 when John Winthrop, standing on the deck of the tiny  Arbella  off the coast of Massachusetts, told that little band of pilgrims, "We shall be as a city upon a hill." 
 A troubled and afflicted mankind looks to us, pleading for us to keep our rendezvous with destiny, that we will uphold the principles of self-reliance, self-discipline, morality, and above all, responsible liberty for every individual... 
 That we will become that shining city on a hill. 
 My friends, I believe that you and I together can keep this rendezvous with destiny. 
 Thank you. 
 God bless you. Thank you very much. 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. God bless you. 
 [ Cheering ] 
 Okay. Okay. 
 [ Cheers and applause continue ] 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Karl : Son of a bitch is charismatic, I'll give him that. 
 But I'm not shaking his hand. 
 Why not, Karl? 
 Because, Sonny, the man made a movie with a monkey. 
 It wouldn't be dignified. 
 Well, hello. 
 Oh, hey. 
 I loved you in "Cattle Queen Of Montana." 
 Well, thank you. 
 Not many people liked that film. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Hello, little girl. 
 Governor, I'll be escorting your bus to the next stop, so whenever you're ready. 
 Well, all right. 
 Ya got drafted? 
 Yeah, Captain called. 
 I offered we had murders to solve, but-- 
 He knows best, probably. 
 Said he did, anyway. 
 Anyway, just gotta take him as far as the state line, so be home by dark. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. Mwah! 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 If you get the chance, ask him if it's true that Joan Crawford had crabs. 
 Yeah, I'm not gonna do that. 
 [ Vehicle approaches ] 
 [ Dog barks ] 
 [ Knife chopping faintly ] 
 [ Door creaks open ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Dodd : We got 'em. 
 Bulo, too? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Milligan? 
 No, he wasn't there. 
 You can bet they're gonna come back at us hard. 
 I thought they'd negotiate. 
 That's the feminine side, Ma. 
 It was always gonna be war, them knowing Rye was dead. 
 Killing him, I mean. 
 [ Crunches ] 
 I want this butcher dead. 
 In Luverne. 
 No mercy. 
 [ Apple crunches ] 
 [ Kisses ] I'm sending Virgil. 
 [ Rye groans ] 
 [ Dog barking in distance ] 
 Hon? 
 Hon? 
 Sorry. Are we are out of coffee? 
 What? 
 What? 
 Uh... [ Sighs ] 
 Did you... 
 You weren't in bed, so I-- 
 I know. I was just thinkin'. 
 What? 
 What we should take. 
 Take where? 
 When we go. 
 Where are we going? 
 To California. 
 What are you-- What are you talking-- 
 When we run, I mean. 
 You heard what Lou said. 
 I-I mean, if we've just messed things-- if I've just messed things up from the start, if-- if this is still not over, just the tail of the snake... 
 What-- what are you sayin'? 
 I mean, what was he even doin' in the road, for sh1t sake? 
 That fella. 
 All those dead people, and... and he had a car, so why was he standing in the road? 
 I-I don't know. 
 But... [ Sighs ] 
 Constance saw. 
 Saw what? 
 The car, after you cleaned it, but before we crashed it again. 
 She knows about the accident. 
 She drove me home the night I... [ Inhales deeply ] 
 [ Exhales deeply ] The night you got rid of the... 
 And, uh, had to use the bathroom. 
 I was gonna walk her right out, but then I heard music coming from the garage, and she came up by me and saw. 
 Well, I mean, what did she say, though? 
 I... I don't think she'll tell, but how can we know for sure, ya know? 
 And plus now with the law enforcement askin' questions, suspectin'. 
 And-- and these ghouls on the come, Lou said. 
 Hon, we can't stay here. 
 No. 
 Hon? 
 No. 
 You said. We agreed. 
 Clean it up, and everything'd be-- 
 I know. Hon? 
 No. 
 We-- we did this for a reason, Peg. 
 For the shop and the kids. 
 For a reason, so we could stay. That's the only-- 
 Hon, you got-- you gotta be realistic. 
 No, no. I-- We're stayin'. 
 That was... [ Stammers ] 
 Whatever comes, we'll deal with it, or it'll deal with us. 
 But I'm buying the shop, and we're starting a-a family. 
 But... how? 
 It's too late to get the money back for the course. 
 And-- and-- and you said bud had to have it by Friday. 
 We'll figure it out. That's what people do. 
 They figure things out, stay together, make it work. 
 [ Ascending footsteps ] 
 [ Sighs deeply ] 
 [ Dog barking in distance, rooster crows ] 
 [ Door opens and closes ] 
 [ Horse whinnies in distance ] 
 I can help. 
 Do your chores, kid. 
 I'm serious. Playtime's over. 
 I can do it. You saw. 
 Luverne, Minnesota, Ed Blumquist. 
 He's posing as the town butcher. 
 This is baloney. 
 I'm not just some crippled kid can't shoot straight. 
 Ask your dad. If he says you can go, you can go. 
 It should be us. 
 A Gerhardt. 
 He killed a Gerhardt, so it should be one of us. 
 A real boss'd know that. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You're taking the kid. 
 You're the boss. 
 You walk him in, he pulls the trigger. 
 [ Closes car door ] 
 Anything goes wrong... 
 [ Car door opens ] 
 You fix it, you understand? 
 [ Closes door ] 
 [ Door creaks opens ] 
 Where do you think you're goin'? 
 Got an errand. 
 Send one of the boys. 
 I can run my own errand. 
 It's not safe. 
 [ Engine starts ] 
 Goddamn it!

 You okay? 
 My mother could find the cloud in every silver lining. 
 That's cute. 
 Mine smiles all the time, like some ghoul. 
 I think it's 'cause dad hits her when she looks sad. 
 I see thing one. Where's thing two? 
 Dead. 
 Your Indian killed him. 
 Killed a lot of people. 
 I didn't know that was happening. 
 Nobody told me. 
 You believe me? 
 Right? 
 What are we, in your mind? 
 Romeo and Juliet? 
 No. 
 I don't know. 
 She was a true gloom, my mother. 
 We used to eat in the dark. 
 For a laugh, I wrote on her tombstone, "Here lies Barbara Milligan, happy till the end." 
 Me, on the other hand, I'm an optimist. 
 So when I see this... 
 [ Gags and gasps ] 
 Ugh! Oh! 
 Oh! 
 I don't think the sky is falling. 
 I think that, sir, is the sound of opportunity knocking. 
 Not so much, my young friend. 
 It's not my fault. 
 They had a meetin' without me. 
 I woulda said. 
 If you want me to take you seriously, you have to be a serious person. 
 Have a beer, do a line, blow your load. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 All that's fine, but it's not the point. 
 [ Whispers ] What's the point? 
 I wanna know what they're gonna do before they do it. 
 Every time. 
 Otherwise, you can die with the rest of them.

 This is 1-8. Go ahead. 
 I got Fargo PD on the line looking for ya. 
 Yeah, okay. Patch it through. 
 [ Siren wailing in distance ] 
 Hey, how's your day then? 
 Uh, peachy. You? 
 Oh, it's a sh1t sandwich up here. 
 Got 12 dead in the woods-- half Gerhardt, half Kansas City, plus the local zoning commissioner with half his face in the bushes. 
 Good Christ. 
 Yeah, this thing's gonna get worse before it gets better. 
 Well, on my end, we think we know what happened to Rye Gerhardt. 
 Run over by a local beautician. 
 Got stuck in her windshield. 
 We think, uh, she and her husband panicked and dumped the body someplace. 
 Meanwhile, we've got visitors from both factions most likely looking for revenge, so little like the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
 Well, my Captain thinks I should try to intervene, seeing as how my mom knows Floyd, and maybe cooler heads can prevail, et cetera, which, well, you saw how well that went over last time, huh? 
 Sounds like maybe I should come up. 
 I wouldn't mind the company. 
 [ Reagan speaks indistinctly ] 
 [ Sighs deeply ] 
 Well, I'm stuck in this Reagan detail today, so assuming we survive the night here, I'll, uh, drive up first thing. 
 Thanks. 
 [ Horn blares ] 
 Okay, I'll try to keep the pot from boiling over in the meantime. 
 Yeah. Over. 
 Ed : No, I-- Yeah, that's, uh, I understand. 
 It's a-- it's a... recession. 
 No, I-I appreciate it, and... 
 Okay. Okay, say hi to Aunt Velma for me. 
 Nothin'? 
 Personally not sure why you're makin' all this effort. 
 Gonna buy the shop, be my own boss. 
 And? 
 And what? 
 That's the American dream. 
 What's the point? 
 Just gonna die, anyway. 
 What do you mean? 
 Camus says knowing we're all gonna die makes life a joke. 
 So what, you just-- you just give up? 
 You could kill yourself, get it over with. 
 Okay, that-- that's not... 
 [ Stammers ] 
 I-I mean, come on, you gotta-- you gotta try. 
 No. 
 You go to school, you get a job, you start a family. 
 Die. 
 That's-- 
 Would you please stop saying that? 
 [ Brakes squeal ] 
 I'm gonna live a long, long life.

 At which point he did what? 
 Died.

 Well, okay, uh... 
 I'm gonna go in the back now, away from this nonsense.

 I will.

 You want that I should carry you over there? 
 No, I-I just, uh... 
 Well, do I, uh... you know, shoot him in the head or in... 
 Don't overthink it.

 Uh, the, um... [ Sighs ] 
 Looking for the butcher. Blumquist. 
 Yeah. He's not the butcher. 
 More the assistant butcher, though that's gonna change, I think.

 Uh, you need to... 
 He's in the back. 
 Buzz him for you. 
 [ Buzzer sounds in distance ] 
 [ Pounding in distance ] 
 Oh, hey. I read that. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Last year. 
 It's... pretty depressing. 
 Really? 
 See, I think it's beautiful. 
 But then, everyone always says, "Noreen, you're morose." 
 Halloween  is my favorite holiday. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I like Easter. 
 Of course. The Resurrection. 
 It's like why everyone loves Rocky, even though it's a boxing picture.

Which, I know you're mostly his guy, but I just want you to know, there's a place for you at our table, with or without him. All you gotta do is be straight with us. Am straight. Well, of course, it's just... We just escalated this war... [ Cocks pistol ] On account of what you... The information you found out about Rye.

Swift boat patrol, two tours. Well, I sure appreciate your service. Every generation has their time. I remember back in '42, America just joined the war. I was working on, uh... "Operation Eagle's Nest" for Paramount. [ Urinal flushes ] I got dropped behind enemy lines trying to rescue Jimmy Whitmore and Laraine Day from this SS commando. Bob Stack was on loan from Selznick. That Nazi b*st*rd had us cornered. We were done for, but in the end, with a little American ingenuity, we managed to, uh... [ Zips pants ] Oh, no. No, no, wait a minute. Um... Come to think of it, I don't think we made it out of that one. Or did we? Oh, sh1t, I can't remember. Well, either way, it was a fine picture. [ Urinal flushes ] Um... [ Turns on faucet ] Um...

Probably got another two hours on this Reagan detail... Oh? So I thought maybe I'd just stop by and make a nuisance. [ Chuckles ] Are you-- are you hungry? I-I can fix you somethin'. You're sweet. I'm just now trying to decide if I'm hungry or if I want to throw up. Don't normally confuse the two. Well, nausea's a side effect of this drug they gave me. Which would mean they actually gave me the drug and not candy. There's candy? Eat something green, and we'll talk. So, we're, uh, rooting for nausea there, huh? Well, okay. Um... I'm just all left thumbs when it comes to this stuff. Mm, you're doing great, Dad. No, I don't know about that. Your mom were here, she'd know just what to say. Me? I can fix the toaster. [ Clears throat ] Well, maybe just, uh... Do you think maybe... you could watch Molly for a bit? I just don't-- I'm not sure if I can keep my eyes open right now... [ Chuckles ] Okay. For some reason. [ Chuckles ] [ Loudly ] Watch who? Molly : Me! Who? Me! Well, what the heck? Thank you, Dad. Hmm. Yeah, sure. You get some rest. We'll just be here, uh, eatin' sugar cereal and playing with my service weapon. What the heck is that? A rhinoceros? Yeah, it's Charlie. I'm looking for dad. Well, is he-- When's he coming back?
