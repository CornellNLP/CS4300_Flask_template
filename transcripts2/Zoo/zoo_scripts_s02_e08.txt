 Mitch :  A year ago, the animals started acting strangely, but no one noticed...  [growling]  ...until they began attacking, coordinating, evolving. The animals were mutating, and it was happening faster than anyone expected. 
 [screaming] 
 The government came up with a plan. 
 PSA narrator : Thanks to the Noah Objective, in six to ten years, the world's animal population will be thriving once again. 
 You cannot exterminate every animal on the planet and then repopulate it. 
 Mitch :  But messing with Mother Nature could be catastrophic, so a group of us are trying to save the animals. Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta, animal experts. Dariela Marzan, army ranger. Jamie Campbell, a reporter who's been following this story, found me, Mitch Morgan, a veterinary pathologist. Together, we're going to find a cure for the animals. Time is running out. 
 Previously on This sloth was capable of creating an earthquake in Costa Rica. We need that sloth. Clearly, its switch is turned on and if I can understand his switch, I might be able to figure out a way to keep yours from turning on at all. That's the first six nucleotides of the ghost gene. How could Davies create a gas that targets a gene that you can't even find? He'd have to have somebody even smarter than me to figure it out. What if he was right? Who? Robert. What if something in his work could keep other people from dying? It can't. Mom. Then why are you bringing all of this back? What about me? Does my father have this ghost gene? Maybe you didn't inherit the gene. Maybe your dad  made a synthetic version of it, and he injected you with it. The professor's asking about his son. He's refusing to continue. Reach out to our asset. It's me. Is Jackson Oz still on board? Yeah. You want me to take care of him? No, sit tight. I'll be in touch. [growling] Mitch : Nope! All right, get the needle. Get the needle. Jackson : Why didn't the nitrous oxide work? [hissing] Mitch : It froze before it could take effect. Injection's the only way. Abraham : Okay, I got him. Jackson : Easy. Hold him tight. Okay, okay, okay. Injection's in. Okay. [growling] Is he unconscious? Looks like he's getting there. Damn, that thing is ugly. Imagine if it made it downtown. Would have turned South Beach into the South Pole. Yeah, I've had enough cold for a while. So, Logan and I are gonna take the other SUV. Sounds good to me. Wish I could put Logan in there with you. [tires screech] Let's go, move! [engine revs, tires screech] [phone chimes, buzzes] Everything all right? It's just my sister. She's a bit dramatic. Mom used to call her Chicken Little. Look outside lately? The sky's falling. [chuckles] Do you think that they would miss us if we just turned back around? We could go check out a little beach bar. I'll buy you a drink. Are you serious? Dude, we're kind of in the middle of something. Yeah, they got it. Let's just go. We can't just take off. [laughs] Forget I said anything. Rain check. [drill whirring] First time we captured a Triple-Helix animal before it was able to create an environmental catastrophe. Local authorities have been notified in case any more flash-freezing lizards turn up in Florida. Well, we're gonna try and have a cure before they do. So, what's the last Triple-whatever animal that we need to track down? Triple-Helix. Try and keep up, genius. And to answer your question, I don't know yet. The rest of these bones, I could put together with my eyes closed. The vulture... the sloth, the snake. Lizard. This last set just doesn't make any sense. Gonna take me a while to figure it out. [coughing] Abraham : Are you okay? Y-Yeah. I'm fine. [sniffs] Jackson. Jackson, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. We're going to fix this. [scoffs] I'm not so sure it can be fixed. What do you mean? When Mitch was poking around inside my head, I remembered what happened in Boston, with my father before we left. The experiments, the fire. The ghost gene. Abe, my father... ...injected me with it. Why? He must have had a reason. Maybe he was punishing me. I don't know what kind of father does that to their own son. Jackson. So you asked me how I'm doing and the truth is, Abe, is that I am barely holding on. It's taking everything I have to just keep my head straight. Hey, keeping you in one piece has always been my job. Perhaps some things never change. [P.A. speaker chimes] Trotter [over P.A.] : We got an emergency call from Allison Shaw. She wants to talk to Jackson. Says it's urgent. Trotter, put her through. She wants to talk to you. Alone. [chirps] [hissing] We have to tell Jackson about his father. He deserves to know. But we don't even know if it is the truth. Jackson has just found out that his father injected him with the ghost gene. If Robert Oz is alive, he's the last person he would want to see. If we tell Jackson now, it could break him. And I fear we would never get him back. [sighs] Okay. So what do we do? We find out if Robert Oz is, in fact, alive. Until then, we say nothing of this to Jackson. Allison : Jackson, there's something that we need to discuss. It concerns your mother. What about her? She was traveling with a group, fleeing Botswana. I'm aware. They were due at a checkpoint in Mozambique three days ago. They never made it. What are you saying? No one's heard from her or from anyone in her caravan. Jackson, your mother's missing. Okay, we are still on the ground here in Florida. It'll be hours be... Allison, you need to send an IADG team to find them, now. Jackson, I'm so sorry, but there's no one left to send. I wish that there was something... No. No, no, no, no. I don't care. You find someone. You find anyone. After everything that we have done for you, don't tell me... don't tell me that you can't send a team out there... [systems powering down] What the hell? Jillion dollars in medical equipment and we can't afford to keep the lights on. [indistinct radio transmissions] Man [over radio] : Clear. Man 2 : Target at twelve o'clock. Man : Copy. Oh, hello. Man : Down on your knees, now. Does that line ever really work for you? [grunts] Where is Oz? Oz? Oh, the munchkins out front didn't tell you? Man : I'll radio the perimeter team. Find Jackson Oz. Non-lethal rounds. Davies wants him alive. Man : Check the top deck. [whispering]: Listen, there's four of them on board. There's more outside. They're here for me. I know. [plane engines whirring] [men shouting] They've cut main power, but we still have control of the critical systems. Trotter has sealed himself in the cockpit. I've told him to get us airborne, to stop reinforcements from boarding. I wish we had more than tranqs. We'll be fine. They'll be using rubber bullets if they want to take you alive. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Shaw said that my mother's caravan has gone missing. Missing? Outside Botswana. We have to get to Africa. If we let Davies' men take control... Then it's time to take back our plane. [indistinct radio transmission] Over here! [grunts] Man : Down! Down! Ugh! Brown's been hit. Tango's on the upper level. Move to flank. If they get behind us, we're finished. Unless I hit them first. They'll never see it coming. Cover me! All right, you ready? Yes. One... two... three! [grunts] Jackson : Abe, go! [grunts] [men grunting] Get on the ground, pretty boy. You wouldn't want to shoot me this close. Ruin Davies' prize. That's not how this works. I've got the rifle. [both grunting] [yells] [both grunting] [Jackson yells] [wood clatters] [groans] Where's Davies? Where is Davies? [groaning] [grunts] Hello, Jackson. ♪ ♪ It's a good thing the army ranger wasn't here. She could've complicated things. Just find Campbell. [scoffs] Triple-Helix animals, environmental anomalies, genomic fossils. You can't be serious. You want me to explain it using smaller words? That research will lead us to a cure. When are you going to accept the fact that there is no cure? You found your cure once and it failed. You failed. The Noah Objective is the only way to stop the animals now. Soldier : Sir, you should see this. Kovacs. Poor b*st*rd. Went from a healer to a monster in a matter of weeks. This man right here is proof that we need to stop the spread of this mutation by any means necessary. Before it happens again. That's right, I know you've got the mutation. What I don't know is how or why. But I got a whole team of scientists just waiting to pick you apart to figure it out. Okay, Davies. I'll go with you. Your men can do whatever you want to me. Under one condition. Jackson, no. My mother and her caravan are missing outside of Botswana. No one knows what's happened. You send a team for help, and I will tell Trotter to land this plane right now. I will walk out of here with you without a fight, do you hear me? I sympathize, Jackson, I do, but I'm afraid your mother is a lost cause. Botswana has all but fallen. So I suggest that you focus on the people that you can help. Namely your team. Because my men are gonna cut through that cockpit door, and they are gonna land this aircraft. And what happens then, what happens to your team, is entirely up to you. [static] [whispers]: Trotter. Trotter. Logan [whispers] : The signal's blocked. [exhales] Oh, Logan. Thank God. Where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere. Davies has some kind of scrambling device set up. You can't get anything out. Well, unless we disable it. Those are trained killers down there. And they already have everybody else. There's no fighting this thing. We need to go. What are you talking about? You and I, we need to jump. Together. Are you kidding me? We get out of this plane. We'll go back to South Beach. Any beach, okay? I could buy you a drink. Just come with me now. Uh... I'm not jumping out of a plane. And I'm not leaving my friends. You should know that. Yeah, I do. The scrambler should be down by the cockpit. It'll be patched into the comms. Okay, just follow me. But don't say I didn't try. Miss Campbell. I was starting to worry we'd lost you. Nice job, Logan. You son of a bitch! Jamie... Ginger's got a mean right. [yells] Logan : Jamie, I tried to give you an out twice. I thought you would've learned your lesson in Caraquet. Why? Jamie, these days you have to look out for yourself. You okay? You were right, never should've trusted him. Hey. Money's in your account. [phone beeps] Yeah, that seems about right. You opened the door. I just walked through. [grunts] [yells] [both grunting] That's enough! Come here. Get them upstairs. This op's already taken longer than it should have. [quietly]: What did you do? The sloth can tear the plane apart. Just go with it. [grunts] [seat belts jangling] It's okay. [low shrieking] [rumbling] [rumbling] Ouch. Ow. Hey! Could you give me a little help here? It's supposed to be uncomfortable. Well, look at these bruises. They're all over. Oh, we'll have to confirm that. Don't you dare touch her. What are you gonna do about it, Beastie Boy? [low rumbling and shrieking resumes] [loud shriek] [loud shrieking] [men yelling] [shrieking] [men grunting] [shrieking continues] Jamie, look out! [grunts] [yells] [grunting] [men groaning] Jamie : Logan's getting away. [grunts] [both grunt] [hissing] Davies! [grunts] [Abraham yells] Son of a bitch! Go. Jamie, where are you going? To find Logan! The sloth! [groans] [loud shrieking] [shrieking stops] [grunting] Stay with me, Davies. You and I are going to have a little conversation about Robert Oz. [alarm blaring] Jamie : The whole time? You were working for Davies the whole time! Come on, Jamie. I saw the moment that you changed in Caraquet. When you held Gwen's arm and you wouldn't let her go. In that moment, you made the choice. You made the same choice that I made. That you're gonna survive in this new world. Whatever it takes. Was any of it real? I'm sorry. I really did want to have a drink with you. Logan, wait. You're right. Whatever it takes. [tranquilizer dart fires] Good luck opening your chute. [plane engine roars] 
 
 Trotter [over P.A.] : Got the power back up. Comms, too. [typing on keyboard, phone rings] [phone beeps] Jackson, what is going on over there? Did you send a rescue team to find my mother? No, I told you, we're just spread too thin right now. I'm sorry, but... No, this is not a request, Allison, this is a demand, okay? We have General Davies. What? General Davies and some hired men tried to storm our plane and kidnap me. But we stopped them. You stopped them? Jackson, do you have any idea what this could mean? Allison, If the IADG wants General Davies to live through the night, I expect a rescue team to have found my mother by the time we land in Mozambique. Just think about this for a second, okay? You're holding hostages. You're making demands. You sound like a terrorist. If the government finds out you've taken a four-star general hostage, you'll be lucky if all they do is lock you up in Guantanamo for the rest of your life. I guess we'll be sharing a cell. After the administration discovers that you've been secretly funding an operation in opposition of their very public embrace of the Noah Objective, well, I'm pretty sure that they'll consider that treason, don't you think, Allison? Just so we're clear, if you go down this path, you're putting everything that we do here at risk. Things will never be the same. Just find my mother and bring her back. [phone beeps] [phone clatters] [both grunt] Abe. You're really doing this. Yes, I am. Has he said anything about Robert Oz? No. And I won't. Even if Robert Oz was still alive, what use would I have for a lunatic who can't even get a job teaching high school biology? We have it on good authority that that lunatic is working for you. Once a reporter, always a reporter, huh? Well, there's no story here. No matter how much you make me bleed. Everyone talks, given time. [both grunting] I don't know how much time we have. [chuckling] Remember the venom dealer in Portugal? Are you serious? You said it yourself, we're short on time. We need answers. Get the venom. Venom dealer? Well, that sounds scary. So, it never occurred to you that blackmailing our only ally in Washington might not be in the best interest to the team? I made a decision. Deal with it. What are you gonna do if they say no? You gonna throw Davies off the plane? Are you actually crazy enough now to do that? You gonna kill him? How is this any different from the time that you offered to turn the Mother Cell over to Reiden to save Clementine? Well, I can think of one big difference. Oh, yeah? What's that? I didn't go through with it! That's not even true! Thinking about betraying the team and doing it, not the same thing. Jamie : Hey! What going on up there? Where's Davies? He's with Abe. What's the plan? Great, while you guys figure that out, I'm gonna go help Abe. Jackson... I'm done talking. Me, too. We got a bigger problem. Oh. The lizard could be anywhere. Which is not good because planes and ice don't really mix well. Oh, hey. Hey, hey. Is it alive? Barely. If this thing dies, the cure dies with it. This is the venom of the inland taipan. Deadliest snake in the world. [scoffs] You are going to tell us what we want to know, or I am going to inject you with it. Once it enters your bloodstream, it will feel like every nerve in your body is firing at once. This pain will only end with antivenom... or your death. If I were you, I'd start talking, General. Just do it already, so I don't have to listen to your endlessly inane clucking. Very well. [Davies grunts] [breathing heavily and groaning] Where is Robert Oz? Go to hell. We know about the TX gas. It's gonna kill 2.2 million people. [strained]: It's going to save seven billion. It's murder. Murder? The animals are slaughtering us. What do you call that? [yells] Abe, we got to give him the antivenom. No. What? No. What does Robert Oz have to do with any of this? [groaning] You are going to die if you don't you answer me. Where is Robert Oz? So... what if I die? The TX gas will be my... legacy. He'll-he'll make sure of that. Who? Who do you think? Robert Oz? He wanted this? Wa... wanted it? The gas, the Noah Objective. Repopulating the planet with animals using clean DNA. It was all... his idea. Why? Tell us why! [guttural groan] Davies? Davies! Abe, give him the antivenom now! [exhales] Abe! He's dead. [grunting] Jamie : Anything? No. I'll get the defibrillator. Hurry. Hurry! Mitch : Gonna have to open him up. See if there's any internal bleeding. Sure it's safe? Well, its body temperature is still within normal range. Yeah, for now, but happens when he wakes up and gets all Mr. Freeze on us? Unless you want to turn this plane around and go back... No, no, no, no, we have to get to my mother. Oh, no, no, no. Crap. [electricity buzzing] This lizard is our only shot. And with the new protocol...  [phone rings] His DNA is only good to us when he's still alive. It's Shaw, I have to take this. What.. hey... I can't do this surgery alone! Which is why I'll be quick. [Abe grunting] Where's the defibrillator? It's out of commission, so I got the next best thing. Ants? A defibrillator delivers an electric charge straight to the heart. So some electrically charged ants ought to do the trick. Do we have a choice? Tell me you have good news for me, Allison. A rescue team is en route. Thank you. Don't thank me. I had to falsify documents to a fake crisis and lie to a decorated colonel. If your team finds my mother, then you will get the general back when we land in Mozambique. You have my word. But right now, I don't have time for this, okay? We are about to lose an animal and our only shot at the cure... Whatever it is, I need to speak with Davies right now. I need to make sure that he's still breathing. Fine. Jackson? [electricity crackling] What the hell is going on here? Jackson. Is he dead? Just for a minute. Use the ants. [electricity buzzing] Jackson, what the hell is going on? Just hold on a second, Allison. Jackson : Okay, now what? I don't know, they don't have an on/off switch. We are gonna lose this lizard unless we... What the? Is that Mitch? Put him on the phone. What are you doing? You put him on the phone now. Someone wants to talk to you. Uh... I need to speak with Davies. [electricity buzzes] Okay, let me see if I can wake him up. What? What's plan B, 'cause it's not working! What's not working? Mitch : It's hard to explain. And harder to imagine. Phew. [grunts] Abraham : He's back! He's back. You used the antivenom. You coward. The information you hold is far more valuable than your life. Lucky for you. [wheezing exhale] Okay, Allison, you heard Davies. He's alive. Now find her. [phone beeps] Jackson? [dial tone, phone clatters] I don't know what happened here, and I don't want to, but we've got a lizard to save. So, you, you, come with me. You, stay here with him. Try not to kill him this time. I'll try. [groans] [monitor beeping] Grab that syringe. Here. Now, I need you to drain the bladder. What? I've only got two hands here. They're both wrist-deep in lizard guts. Come over here. See that thing right there, looks like a little chestnut? Yeah. Just stick the needle in there and pull back on the plunger. Slowly. All right. There you go. Beautiful. All right, that's enough. Well done, doctor. Hey. I grabbed the de-icer just in case our friend decides to wake up. Hopefully we won't need it. Okay, tying off the bleeder. [lizard snorts] Uh-oh. Mitch... Jamie : That's ice. Okay, that's enough. Back off. Just give me a second, okay? I got it. [ice crackling] Mitch, I'm not messing around. Back off. Jackson, you can't do that. Okay? You're gonna kill him. [rapid beeping] Guys, his body temperature's dropping. Mitch, get away from the ta... Not now, Jackson! Ah! Okay. Done. Grab the blanket. Go. Hurry up! All right. Here we go. All right. Jackson : I'll get the freezer. [all panting] Jamie : Oh. Anybody want a cold one? [blows] [both laughing] I'll wager that's the first time since this started that an animal actually saved someone's life. Keep your mouth shut. Seriously, how many people do the animals have to kill before you wake up? The animals are sick. When people are ill, you take them to the doctor. And when a dog has rabies, you put it down. You don't travel around the world looking for a magic wand. You may not like this, but the Noah Objective is the only way to protect the people and save the animals. Robert Oz said so himself. I'll believe that when I hear it come out of his own mouth. Tell me where he is. No. And if you ask me that question one more time, when your friend Jackson comes back, [scoffs] I'm gonna tell him your little secret. [chuckles] [sighs] What secret? That meeting Jackson in Uwei as a young man wasn't a coincidence. That you knew Robert Oz long before you met his son. Robert told you that? [laughs softly] Actually, you just did. [sighs] You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Did he say anything about Jackson's dad? He doesn't know anything. Abraham : You are going to leave this plane without what you came for. Sounds like something you should worry about, not me. If you want Jackson, you're going to have to go through me. I killed you once. And I will gladly do it again. [scoffs] There's going to come a day very soon when you'll come looking for me. Today is not that day, General. So get the hell off our plane. Get. Ah, Allison. You look beautiful as always. You look like the dog's dinner. Your team may have had something to do with that. I believe you're confused, General. That's understandable, given the stress of surviving a lion attack. A lion attack? You were taken hostage by a group of extremists when your convoy was overrun by lions. Is that so? It is indeed. And why would I agree to any of this nonsense? Because my staff is assembling a committee to investigate this little black-ops mission of yours. A congressional investigation would slow the Noah Objective to a crawl. [sighs] Don't you think? Oh, I think even all your red tape can't delay this, Allison. I have the international support I need to make the Noah Objective a reality. We'll see. [scoffs] Next round of voting is coming up. I trust you'll be there? I look forward to it. [laughs softly] Soldier : Sir. I trusted you. You undermined this mission, this team, and my authority. Just tell me where my mother is. The rescue team found her caravan. It was... Well, there was some sort of animal attack. An aid group is still looking for survivors. Take me there. Jamie : Oh, man. [sighing]: It's even worse with the lights on. Oh, don't worry about this. I don't know if you've noticed, but our messes seem to get magically cleaned up despite the lack of a crew on this plane. Drink? Yeah. Sure. [Mitch groans] [blows] Well, thanks for... helping me save the freeze-y lizard. Well, yeah, that's kind of what I do. Jamie Campbell. Helper of Saving Stuff. That what you were trying to do with Logan? Help save him? [sighs] Listen, I don't blame you for trusting that guy. Especially when you... you probably thought you had to. Stop. All I'm saying... Just stop. You don't have a fraction of a clue what I had to do to survive. That's true. Because you haven't really been sharing, have you? Well, what difference would that make, exactly? I mean, you've been cocooned in this flying Ritz-Carlton. You don't have a clue what's actually happening out there. True again. But is it so wrong for me to want to look out for you? You don't need to look out for me. If you want to protect someone, go be with your daughter. Wow. You're gonna make this about Clementine now, really? No, no. It's about you. And me. This, this... If I don't have a fraction of a clue about something, it's what this even is. Well, yeah, that makes two of us. [glass shatters] Don't worry, I'm sure somebody will clean it up. [bird caws] [men speaking Swahili] More bodies here. [man speaks indistinctly] Allison : Did you know these people? Abraham : Yes. They're from Elizabeth's village. Jackson, these bodies... they look like the people Kovacs killed in Patagonia. Hujambo. Hujambo. Are there any survivors? In the med tent over there. Is there no one else? I'm sorry. Jackson. Dede, have you seen my mother? Have you seen Elizabeth? What happened here? Dede, it's okay. We were sleeping, I heard screams of terror. Everyone was dead. Elizabeth ran into the woods. What did this? Your mother. She did. She killed all of them.
