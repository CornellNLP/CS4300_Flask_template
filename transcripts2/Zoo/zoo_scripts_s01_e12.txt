 (Episode 12 is preceded by episode 11.) 
 Abraham :  For centuries, mankind has been the dominant species. We've domesticated animals, locked them up, killed them for sport. But a series of recent events seem to suggest all across the globe animals have decided: "no more." And so we were hired, a team of people from different backgrounds, with different specialities: an expert in animal behavior, a journalist, safari guide, foreign intelligence agent, and a veterinary pathologist. Our task: to find out what is happening with the animals, why it's happening, and how to stop it. 
 Previously on (Cub squeals) (Lions roar) I think these lions are communicating with each other, long distance. Are you willing to join me and do something about it? The global pandemic your father believed was about to emerge, it has arrived. You work for Reiden Global. I know the FBI just issued a warrant for your arrest. Give me the Mother Cell, and I'll see what I can do about helping you out. The answer's no. I believe that if we introduce the Mother Cell into the DNA of a mutated animal, we could possibly synthesize a cure. But we need an animal who has mutated and has not been exposed to the Mother Cell. Mitch : Specifically leopards. There are some areas in Africa where there's no reported Reiden activity. Zambia, Africa. There is a way to get back to Africa. Oh, no, you're thinking about Ray, aren't you? Who's Ray? Raymond Joseph Endicott. We need to get out of the country. Off the books, under the radar. How soon do you need to leave? (Siren wailing) No! Chloe! This one's all mine. So... France, huh? Excuse me? You're French? Yes. Oui. Yeah, I never been. That's too bad. My wife... my late wife... she was always fussing about going. Paris, in particular. Women love Paris, don't they? What's so great about Paris? Your friend was lying to you. Shut your hole! Agent Shafer Don't use his name. was working for Reiden. He was lying to you. This is where you stop. This is where you stop or I drive and I find a deep, deep river someplace and I make you stop in an awful way. It-it tarnishes my badge, but I'll get over it, all right? Do you know what he was doing in Biloxi? Your friend was on Reiden's payroll. He was working for the company responsible for the spreading animal problem. The problem that my team is trying to solve. Yeah, I don't have many friends. I had one. Yeah, and he's dead. And not only are you scumbums responsible for his death, but now you-you want  to besmirch his good name. I'm gonna crush your team, You're crazy. That's what rage does to a man. (Engine revving nearby) (Chloe screams) (Tires screeching) (Grunting) Mitch : I'm a little envious of Chloe right now. Nice air-conditioned cell. My man here in Zambia's the real deal. He'll have the intel on leopard sightings, and he'll outfit the lot of us. This is rough bush. We need a lot more than a tranq gun. Thanks, Ray. You got it. Look, I'm with you now and I aim to help, all right? Because? Come on, say it for me, sport. Shut up. No, one more time. Honestly, I can't get enough of it. The sooner we find the leopards, the sooner we save the world. Whew, beautiful. Hello! Hello? (Indistinct chatter over TV) Uh, Jackson? Jamie : What is it? You might not want to... Oh, my God! Well, that explains why they didn't answer our radio call. Ray : Damn it. This is my guy. Man with the plan. Looks like he put up a good fight though. Jamie : Who would do this? Mitch : Not who... what. Those are claw marks. Leopards. This is a slaughter. I mean, they weren't even feeding. It's just... Mitch : Strange. Yeah, "strange" is good. "Strange" tells us we're on the right track. You guys. This is happening in every major continent, every major city. Man : This is not a coincidence. Man 2 : What would you have us do... shoot all the zoo animals? What about farm animals? Pets? My point is this is a virus and it's spreading fast. Man 2 : There is no evidence of a virus. At least they're starting to pay attention. Which means it's getting worse. All the more reason for us to get moving. The car outside... you might find some keys on those bodies over there. Are you serious? (Sighs) They used all our ammo in the fight. Now all we got is this tranq gun. All right, let's do what we came here to do. (Grunting) (Chloe shouts in French) (Chloe panting) (Door closes) (Girls singing) (Singing continues) I'll find out what's happening. (Speaking in Swahili) These leopards we're after... you think they started mutating before the other animals? According to our research, yeah. I buy that. Africa is the birthplace of civilization. Every great evolutionary leap started here. (Speaking Swahili) Chui. Chui! Ah,  chui. (Engine starts) (Singing continues) So, let me guess. Chui  means "leopards"? He said that we should turn back. He said that last night leopards came into their farm and dragged away 12 people. Where's their farm? Hand me that map. (Sighs) Up here. All right, so this is where he said their farm is. This is where the leopards attacked a few days ago. And this is where the airport is. Jamie : It's totally random. Yeah, you'd think they'd move in a clear direction. Yeah, unless... random is part of their plan. When an army wants to take an area, they attack in a haphazard fashion. Causes fear. Rumors of their next attack frightens people enough for them to leave even before the army arrives. Wait, what are you telling me, that leopards are using military strategy? Mitch : It's possible. They're working as a group. Means they're thinking as a group. Well, glad we don't have any real guns then. Uh, if the attacks are random, how are we gonna know where to look for them? I have a feeling the leopards are going to find us. (Door opens) (Chloe panting) (Whimpers softly) Bonjour, Miss Tousignant. (Whispers): Alves? Trust me, nobody knows where you are. No one is coming to rescue you. So how long you are here, that's entirely up to you. Oh, la, la. I told them "be gentle." (Clicks tongue) (Door opens) You were trained by the DGSE to withstand interrogation. But included in that training was the knowledge that, at a certain point, even the best agent will break. So why not save us both the trouble and tell me what I want to know? Where are the rest of your team? I'm not gonna tell you anything. As an intelligence analyst, I thought you would be a little more intelligent. Hmm? They're presently trying to clean up a mess you made. Perhaps you should let them be. They are the mess we made. They need cleaning up. (Latches clicking) You can try to hurt me as much as you wish. It'll do you no good. You are now displaying your naiveté as to how things work. I'm not going to hurt you. Mitch : What is that? Hanging in that tree? (Engine stops) The leopards. Judging from these prints... I'd say a group of about eight or so. I've never seen animals do anything like this to humans. (Flies buzzing) We have. Jackson : Hey, these prints can't be more than a few hours old. That means we're getting closer to the leopards. Their den may be around here. Closer? You want to get closer? That suddenly sounds like a really bad idea. We want to find the cure, right? Let's go find those leopards. You know, that scent's gonna scare away the very leopards you're trying to catch. There's lots of dangerous animals out here, not just leopards. Better to be safe. Didn't your father ever take you camping? I grew up on a farm. Why would I go camping? What's your excuse? Nobody ever took me camping. Would you want to be stuck in a tent with Moody Teenage Mitch? Fair enough. Hey, no offense, but, uh, I would've had this thing up about 20 minutes ago. It's all yours. Excuse me. That's annoying. Well, we all got different skills, don't we, Professor? Yours is imparting wisdom, advancing science. Mine is saving the animals. All right, there you go. Thank you. Maybe you can help me with something now. See, all this doesn't make sense to me. Assuming your plan works, assuming you actually catch a live leopard, you shake up a cocktail of their stem cells and... a chunk of the Mother Cell you got tucked away in your handy little man bag there. Then what, hmm? Poof... All the animals are cured? That's a little reductive, but, yeah, that is the hope. Once we administer the cure... See, that's my point. How do you suppose you're gonna administer the cure, huh? What, a-a garden hose? We are talking about every critter in the world, right? (Quiet growling) (Leaves rustling) Well, what we do here is we take things one step at a time. So first we need to find a cure. Then we'll worry about how to deliver it. Okay? (Insects trilling) Six tranq darts. I hope Ray is as good a shot as he says he is. He is. Much as it pains me to say it. (Bird calling in distance) I used to love the sound of nature. (Animals calling in distance) This is not how the bush should sound. Before, it was something beautiful. Now it's something entirely different. ♪ Bonse aba ♪ 
♪ Mu pokelela ♪ 
♪ Ba lipele maka ♪ 
♪ Akuba bana. ♪ That's what those farm kids were singing today. It's a very old song. I used to sing it with my brothers. I didn't know you had brothers. Not anymore. I used to sing Clem to sleep when she was a baby. (Hoarsely, off-key): ♪ Oh, my darlin' ♪ 
♪ Oh, my darlin' ♪ 
♪ Oh, my darlin' Clementine... ♪ If the ububa leaves don't keep the animals away, I'm sure your singing will. (Both laugh) (Brush crunching) Oh. Easy, cowboy. I'm just gonna go pee. Well, sneak up on us a little bit louder next time, okay? Give us some warning. Okay. Can I have the tranq gun? Okay, but be careful. There's only a few rounds left. Uh, here. Let me... go with you. To hold the gun, because you can't while you... Come on. (Animals calling in distance) Okay. That's far enough. Here. Stay here. (Soft growling) I don't want to rush you, but, um, you done yet? I can't go. What? Why not? I can't pee when there are people around. I'm ten feet away from you, in the dark, in a jungle. I can still see you. Move further away. Keep going. How's this? (Leaves rustling) (Soft growling) (Leaves rustling) (Quietly): Do you hear that? Pee faster. How do you do that even? (Soft growling) Where's Mitch? He's escorting Jamie to pee. (Howling in distance) It's not your watch for another hour. Couldn't sleep. I'm sure she's fine, Jackson. I'm sure she's fine, too. And when we return home with the cure, we'll set everything straight. We'll be heroes. I never cared to be a hero. I just wanted a... quiet, simple life. Which is what we had. Yes, we did. So how in the hell did we let all this happen to us? Anyway... I'm sure she's fine. Do you recognize this apartment? Don't do this. Good. She has nothing to do with any of this. Watch the screen, please. That is Tomas. He is dreadful. He prides himself on it. The feed is live, of course, and we are expecting your sister to come any moment. I know. It's terrible. And yet wildly effective, no? She should be on the Metro about now on her way home from work. Fine. As you know, my sister betrayed me. With my fiancé. Perhaps I will enjoy this a little. I suspected you would attempt that tact. But I can assure you, no one... not the lowest scum of the earth... deserves the pain Tomas is capable of serving up. Jackson : Hey, wake up. What is it? There's something out there. Just saw something zip by. Throw me that box of tranq darts, will you? If it is a leopard, I can handle it. Ray. You stay here. We're safer together. Right. I got this. (Leaves rustling) (Animal howling in distance) (Animal hooting in distance) Nothing there. Looks like we live to die another day. (Leopard roaring) Ray! Oh, my God. (Growling) (Roaring) Oh, my God. Hey, man, look out. (Roaring continues) Jamie... those glow sticks you have. What? Your glow sticks. Bring 'em here. Mitch, behind you. (Snarling) Hah! (Hisses) Oh, my God. Come on, let's go. Go? Go where? I tagged one of the leopards with a glow stick. We can track it. Where are the keys? Jackson, Ray had the tranq gun. We don't have any weapons. We need a plan! We have a plan, okay? This is it. We follow the leopards. That's our best chance. What else you guys want to do? You want to stay here and wait for them to come back? Come on. Hey, right up there. Up ahead, on the right. We're on the right track. Maybe somebody should say something about him. Ray. I mean... nobody should die without words being spoken, right? (Sighs) Ray was... obnoxious, loud and stubborn. But he was passionate. And he cared more about animals on this Earth than any man I've ever met. Looks like the trail's run out. We lost him. Mitch : Okay... team. What now? Jackson : Let's make camp for the night. We can pick up the trail when it gets light out. (Doorknob rattles) Ah. She's home early. (Nathalie screams) No! (Screaming) (Glass shatters) (Screaming continues) Please, no! (Shrieks) I will kill you. I know that you would. But right now, the only way to help poor Nathalie is if you tell me where the rest of your team is. (Line ringing) Put it to her ear. Say it. Say it. Nathalie : No! No, no. (Sobbing) Keep going. (Nathalie screams) (Birds squawking) Abraham : We lost the tranq gun, so we'll make our own. It's not quite ketamine, but it should do the trick. The locals have used the root for hundreds of years to get drunk, so hopefully it's enough to knock out a leopard. That's the most disgusting thing I ever smelled in my life. Mitch : Okay. Whoa, easy. You sure about that? It's for science. (Groans) Mm. Tingles. Hope it does more than that to the leopard. Jackson : Stop the truck. Right up there. You see those trees? With the rocks. The rocks along the base. Yes. Looks like their den. (Grunts) If we can isolate one leopard from the group, we may have a chance. What if we can't? You ready? After you. If they don't come back... Yeah, let's just... not think about that. These tracks are fresh. They're leading away from the den. Well, if they've gone out for a hunt, they won't be back till nightfall. We can watch from the car until they return. Or we can wait right here. All right? If the first one comes back alone, we'll surprise it. What? Ray didn't have to die. What's that supposed to mean? Ray didn't have to die. We should have had a better plan. No, actually, we should have had any plan at all. You think I've been reckless? I know, you've already said that. But no one's coming up with any better ideas. That's because you didn't let them. Man, that's... Look, I don't want any more of your excuses. And I'm not questioning your motives, but if there's no one left alive to help you... (Soft growling) That's a female. They must have left her alone. If that's the case, then maybe she has a cub inside the den. A cub would be a lot easier to deal with than an adult. Abraham : But if she does have a cub, she'll only be gone for a moment. (Twig snaps, leaves rustling) (Mewling nearby) (Mewling) (Leaves rustling) (Mewling) The cub. Let's go make the cure. (Chuckles) (Sighs) What happened to the bridge? The rope's been chewed. We're going to have to drive the long way around the river. If we drive the long way around the river, we have to drive through the Ndube Army's territory. Jamie : The Ndube Army? I'm guessing that's not a real army, right? Far from it. Think of a African Hells Angels. Except instead of motorcycles and leather jackets, they have rifles and machetes. There's no other way. Course there isn't. Mitch : Hey, we sure this is the best plan? I mean, maybe we should just drive fast, get the hell through here, and not worry about the engine noise. Abraham : No. We should stay quiet. (Phone ringing) What is that? It's Chloe's phone. Must've left it in my pack. (Ringing continues) Hello? Man : Who is this? This is Jackson Oz. I'm a friend of Chloe's. Who is this? My name is Pascal Cransac. I work with Chloe at the DGSE. If you know where she is, you need to tell me right away. She's been arrested. She's fine though. She's safe. She's... she's in FBI custody. No, she's not. What do you mean? How do you know that? Because it's my job. The FBI agent who was escorting her back to New York City was found dead on the side of the road, murdered. Now Chloe's missing. What's going on? So now she's wanted for the murder of a second Federal agent. She didn't kill that agent. I know that and you know that, but whoever did do the killing... Has Chloe. If you hear anything from her, please call me on this number. Yes, I-I will. Of course. You do the same. What is it? That Fed, Brannigan... he was killed. Reiden. It had to be Reiden. If that is the case, then what have they done with Chloe? (Nathalie sobbing over speakers) Nathalie : No! (Sobbing continues) Nathalie : No... ah... Oh, this is good. (Clears throat) You're going to enjoy this. (Electrical buzzing, Nathalie screaming) (Buzzing stops, Nathalie sobbing) (Electrical buzzing resumes, Nathalie screaming) Okay. Stop! I'll tell you, but just make him stop right now. You first. (Nathalie sobbing quietly) (Sniffles) They're in India. A small town in Rajasthan. Why India? Nathalie : No, no, no... They're looking for a specific group of leopards, unaffected by Reiden chemicals. You've poisoned the animals everywhere, but not there. Thank you. (Nathalie screams) Now tell him to get the hell away from my sister. If you're lying to me, your sister dies. They're in India. (Nathalie sobbing) (Soldiers shouting) (Soldiers speaking Swahili) (Speaking Swahili) (Abraham speaking Swahili) (Soldier speaks Swahili) (Whispers): What is he saying? I have no idea. (Speaking Swahili) (Shouts in Swahili) Jackson : No, no, no! Jamie : Jackson! No. Don't hurt him. All right? Take me. Take me. Don't hurt him. It's okay. They're not going to hurt me. They think we have money or... or that we are worth money. Who would want to pay for us? We know that, but they don't. What do we do? We have no guns, we have no money, we have nothing. We have him. What are we gonna do, sic a kitten on them? The needle on Abe's spear... hand it to me. (Mewling) (Soldiers shouting) Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? No! No! Jamie! Jamie : No! No! No! No! No! No! Hey! (Grunts) (Soldiers speaking Swahili) What do we do? I don't know yet. They're not taking Jamie for ransom. No. Jackson : If we get an opening, you take out the driver, we'll get Jamie. We just need a diversion. (Soldiers speaking Swahili) (Growling nearby) (Roaring) (Man screaming) (Gunfire, soldiers shouting) (Leopard roars) Jamie! Come on! Come on, come on! (Soldier screams) (Soldier screams) Go! Come on! It worked. (Gunfire continues) (Door opens, closes) (Sighs) You lied to me. I did not. I checked all the flights into India; your friends were not on any of them. They're fugitives; they cannot travel commercial. We paid for passage on a cargo plane. There were three undocumented planes that landed in Rajasthan in the last 24 hours... I checked them, too. Perhaps they changed their plan. No, they're sticking to their plan; it's just not the one you told me. And now your sister will die because of a useless lie. You will not kill her. Mm-hmm. You can't. (Chuckles) Because if you do, you will have no leverage with me, and I'm never gonna tell you what it is you need to know. You're right, of course. Take her left hand. Uh, use the dullest blade you have. I'll come back in ten minutes. Perhaps you will have changed your mind by then, before we move on to Nathalie's right hand. (Door closes) That was great what you did back there. What? What you did with the cub. What are you talking about? Mitch stuck the cub with a needle. His pain sent a distress call. It was just like the lions in L.A. They communicate over long distances. Oh, that was you! Yeah, I just put their newfound mutation to good use. This little guy saved our lives. (Mewls) We did it,  rafiki. Ah, man, you saved my life. I think... What... what happened? It's okay. What-what happened?! Jamie : Oh, my God! Jackson, you've been shot! Let me see, let me see. My God. All right, here. Keep that over the wound. Press down, press down. Oh, my... We got to get him to a hospital. Hold on,  rafiki. Hold on. You are going to make it,  rafiki. Hold on. (Crying): Oh, no, no, no, no, no. (Door opens) (Silenced gunshot) (Chloe panting) Listen to me carefully. We don't have much time. I'm on your side. Things were never supposed to happen like this. It got out of control. I want... I  need  to help fix this. Let me help you. Tell me where Jackson and the others are. Tell me, so we can help them. This is another trick to get me to talk. No, it's not. But I'm risking everything to be here. I need to know you'll trust me. 
 
 (Pounding on door) Gaspard : Open up! Chloe, look at me. Look in my eyes. You're good at this. Look at me and decide if I'm telling you the truth. Gaspard : Unlock this door now! (Gunshot) Delavane : What's it gonna be? Shoot that b*st*rd dead, then maybe we'll talk. (Silenced gunshot) We need to go. M-My... my sister, you have to help her. You have... I already have. (Man speaking French) Delavane : They'll take her to the hospital. We can call from the road. If you're lying to me, I will kill you. They're in Zambia. Let's go finish what we began. Looks like we're ten miles from the hospital. How's he doing? (Gasps, groans) Not so good. (Birds screeching) Oh! Oh! That's the third one in an hour! Mitch : Yeah, that's the same pattern we saw when we were in Boston. (Coughs, groans) We're close, my friend. (Groans weakly) The blood... the blood is coming through the shirt. Keep pressure on it... nice and even. Don't let him pass out. (Jackson coughs) Maybe we should pull over. Lot of things I can handle in a pinch. Kind of surgery he needs... not one of 'em. (Leopard cub growls) The cub is impatient, Rafiki. (Jackson gasps, coughs) You need to give him a name. Maybe a musical name, considering how much noise he makes. Perhaps Bono or Bowie? Jamie : What's going on? Where are they going? Everybody's leaving town. Could be a million reasons. (Jackson coughs) You're worried about your team. I need to talk to them. Reiden will be looking for us. They'll be monitoring cell conversations. If they find you, they can have an interception team wheels up in minutes. Look, I don't even know if Jackson found the leopard, or if they made the cure. Or if they're even alive. I understand. But if this goes well, we'll have the entire weight of the United States government behind us. Maybe you should do it yourself. No. You have one thing that I do not. What's that? You've looked it in the eye. This animal pandemic. You've even managed to get the better of it once or twice. There's one person here who can make them believe. And that's you, Chloe. (Indistinct shouting) (People screaming and shouting) (Leopard cub growling) Grab the electroporator. Oh, my God. That's why they're all leaving. (Hissing) (Growling) (Growling) We need to get inside now. (Growling) Here. (Yelling) Hey! Open the door! It's an emergency! My friend needs a doctor! The hospital is closed. (Alarm ringing) (Jackson grunts) (Screaming and shouting continue) Did you hear what I said? We are abandoning the hospital. You have to go elsewhere. We don't have time. This man's been shot. I can't help. I suggest you drive him to Nyanga. That's four hours at least! I have lost a dozen colleagues and more patients than I can count. I am sorry, but I cannot help you. You will help him! You understand me? You will help... (Growling) (People screaming) The last ambulance leaves in an hour. I will do the surgery, but beyond that, you are on your own. Thank you. Doctor :  Three units of O-negative  and find some morphine! It started at the edge of town. The lions came first, then the leopards. When did the attacks begin? Two days ago. They attacked the young and the elderly first, then the hospitals where they were taken for treatment. It's as if they were... Thinning the herd. People are terrified. They're abandoning the city. I've never seen anything like this. Man (over p.a.) : Evacuation busses will be... Away! No! (People screaming over P.A.) I'm sorry. You can't come with us. Wait... Be strong, Rafiki. You may want this. Thank you. (Lock buzzes) The hematology lab should have what we need to extract this little guy's stem cells, formulate a cure. Hurry, Mitch. I think he's getting scared. (Leopard cub growling) There. Third floor. We're heading to hematology. Come on. (Elevator bell dings) Stay behind me. (Metallic clattering) (Gasps) A single set of paw prints. Look... the teeth went straight through the bone. That means leopards. (Growling) Which way is hematology? (Growling) That way. (Growling) Come on, little guy. Let's go. (Growling, snarling) I would argue that the fearless and aggressive behavior witnessed in these animals is, without question, the direct result of an airborne virus... He's completely wrong. A single-stranded RNA virus, not that unlike canine distemper... You are their one chance to hear the truth. They're scientists. Mitch should be talking to them. You don't need Mitch. You've picked up enough over these last weeks. there is only one logical solution: Identifying and destroying these animals that are infected. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you, Dr. Brettschneider. Mr. Delavane. Jamie : If they're out there, I don't hear them. (Lock clicks) Okay, pal, I'm gonna need one of your teeth, so I can extract some stem cells. Uh... Hand me that rubber heart over there. Why? Because. No need to hurt him if we don't have to. So... I'll just take this... rub little flavor on it. Here you go. Ah, I see. You're going to let the cub remove its own tooth. Exactly. So, uh... assuming I can formulate a cure, we're gonna need an animal we can test it on. Abraham : Even if the cure works, wild animals still act wild. We're going to need a domesticated one. That way we have a clear behavioral baseline. I... Okay, so... don't open this door until I return. What?! No, you... Abe! I'm going to be okay. Jamie : Be careful. You too. My name is Chloe Tousignant. And up until four weeks ago, I was an analyst for the DGSE. My focus was on terrorism... human terrorism. But I have come to believe that the most serious threat to our survival now comes from the animal kingdom. (Murmuring, whispering) My team has discovered that there is a genetic mutation throughout the animal kingdom. How can you possibly account for a mutation, given the absence of antigenic drift? Chloe : I don't know what that means. (Audience murmuring) But I do know that a virus brings other symptoms. These animals are healthy and killing them is not the answer. What we're dealing with is a mutation. Interspecies? That's ridiculous. Most of the animals display something called the "defiant pupil." An environmental event of global proportions is happening. My team has risked their lives to prove it. The animals have developed a biological imperative to destroy us. (Murmuring) If they continue to attack our technology, which they have done. If they continue to develop interspecies communication, which they have done. If they no longer see us as apex predators, which they do not. If all of this continues, the balance of nature will collapse, and we will be facing a mass extinction event. (Murmuring becomes louder) A mass... extinction event? Yes. Okay, well, I've had enough of this. Please! My team is in Africa and they need your help. We need your help! Mitch :  So...  we carted this thing halfway around the world. About time we used it. This is insane. I mean, this thing has to work for any good to come out of all of this. I mean, my mom dying, and... Or maybe that was a really stupid thing to say, I'm sorry. What's it like being human? Oh, my God. Mitch... here's a tooth. You're kidding me. Already? Yeah. All right. Bet you never thought we'd be saving the world with a tooth and a rubber heart. (Grunts) I've been looking for you. How's Jackson? He'll sleep for another hour or two. Check on him then. He's on the second floor, in post-op. As soon as he wakes, start the antibiotic. The other is for pain. We are gathering the last of the patients. Stay away from the animals. There will be no one left to help you. Thank you, Doctor. (Monitor beeps steadily) (Growling) Hi. I got here as soon as I could. Oh. You didn't have to. Of course. I was worried. Yeah, well, I'm stubborn, right? Takes more than a bullet to stop me. A bullet, an army of animals, evil men trying to kill us... Yeah. We've been through a lot. Yeah, we have. When they were, um... wheeling me into the room, I was thinking about you. (Growling) (Screaming) (Crying, screaming) (Growling) (Screaming, shrieking) (Growling) (Bones cracking) God, forgive me. I have not been a religious man. But... if you get us out of this, I promise that will change. Just give me a sign. (Dog barking) (Tires screech) (Barking continues) (Barking stops) Oh! Hey! Easy... (Gasps) Easy... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey... Bacco's very sick. It is enough. No more. No, no, no! No! Stay back! My brother, please, please. Let me take Bacco. I think there is a way I can save him. I've tried. All of my neighbors have shot their animals. I'm the last. Then let me help him. It is a terrible world where a man has to shoot his own dog. Let me help him. If I cannot, I will do it myself. Come on, Bacco. Come on. You're coming with me. Hey. (Grunts) Undo the chain, quickly! (Screaming, crying) (Gasping anxiously) (Leopard growling) Shh. Shh. (Crying, gasping) (Crackling) (Leopard growls) It's okay, it's okay... it's okay, I got you. (Grunting) Shh. It's gonna be okay, all right? I'm gonna... I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? (Grunting) (Growls) Boy :  Bhudhi vangu! Bhudhi vangu! Bhudhi vangu! Bhudhi vangu! Bhudhi vangu! It's okay, it's okay. Bhudhi vangu! Huh? Bhudhi vangu! Sielewi. Bhudhi vangu! I d... Tell him I don't understand. - Bhudhi vangu! Bhudi vangu? Ah, wait, no, no, no, no! Girl :  Mukoma. Mukoma. Jackson :  Mukoma? Y-Your brother's out there? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Your brother's in there? (Groans) Good news is... we got some viable stem cells here. (Cub mewling) So... our little friend has done his part. He's crying so much. You don't think it's a call, do you? Mitch : Why don't you try closing the bag? Maybe he shares my aversion to hospitals. Is that why you dropped out of med school? No. I never liked hospitals. But I think it was the patients that finally did me in. Will you hand me one of those cuvettes over there? Uh, which one? The-the square tube with the lid on it. I didn't hate the patients. I just... hated their pain. Their tears. And their families' tears. You shut down your emotions for long enough, you don't want to spend all day with somebody else's. Does it bother you when I talk about my mother? It did. When we first met. But... I'm okay with it now. I've actually learned a lot from you, Jamie Campbell. How's that for a compliment? I'll take what I can get. Is this gonna work? In theory. (Whirring, beeping) So, there's something I got to say. And I better say it now, before this whole thing goes south. I want to thank you. For... dragging me into this insanity. You don't have to thank me. And I want to thank you for... giving me the courage to save my daughter. And for reminding me that... that it's okay to feel and... Look, I know you couldn't save your mother, but, truth is, you kind of saved me. (Beeping) (Whirring slows, stops) All right. Well, here we go. This is it. Hope to God we were right. I have to find Jackson. (Leopard roars) (Gasps) (Snarling) (Growling, hissing) (Growling) Mitch, wait, the Mother Cell. (Alarm wailing) Mitch : Forget it. Let's go. (Leopard growls) What's happened? The leopards. They came after the cub. I know it sounds crazy, but... maybe that's what those birds were doing. Abe, we lost the Mother Cell. And the cure? This is it. It's all we got. One shot, maybe two. Okay. I found a dog, and I put him in one of the patient rooms. If this doesn't work... There's only one way to find out. (Barking) First, the birds. Now the leopards. It's no coincidence. They're after the cub. All right, this is it. No room for mistakes. (Dog barking, snarling) Ready? One... (Barking, growling) two... three... (Whimpers, barking) How long does it take to work? (Barking) I don't know. (Barking, snarling) (Phone ringing) Hello? Who is this? Chloe : Hey. It's Chloe. How is everyone? Chloe, oh, my God. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'll explain everything later. (Barking) Uh, we're-we're fine. We-we found a cub. Great. What's that sound? Where are you? Uh, we're at a hospital in Harare. We're-we're actually testing the cure right now. Wait, where are you? Washington. Why are you testing it in a hospital? Listen, Chloe, um, something happened. Jackson got hurt. He's going to be fine, but-but... Where'd you get this? It's clean. I borrowed it. I told you not to do that, Chloe. It doesn't matter anymore. They didn't believe me. This was the one thing I can do to help. And I failed. I'm sorry. Man : Ms. Tousignant. Mr. Delavane. Would you come with us, please? (Panting) (Crying) Your br... your brother's out there? Mm-hmm. (Door creaking) (Curtain rattling) (Groaning softly) (Curtain rattling) (Door creaks open) (Curtain rattling) (Panting) (Soft whimpering) (Grunting in pain): Okay. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Okay. Okay. (Panting) (Growling) (Growls) (Grunting, groaning) (Hisses) (Grunting, groaning) (Growling) (Barking) If it was gonna work, we'd have seen some evidence by now. (Sighs) Sorry, guys. This is all my fault. It's no one's fault. Mitch : Yeah, I... I'm the one who told you all that the leopard cub was the-the answer. I'm the one who said the Mother Cell was the key to the cure. It was just a theory. Not even a theory. Half a theory. Now's not the time for self-pity. It didn't work. Tell me why. Okay. Should I start with the fact that I'm not a geneticist? Or should I start with the fact that somehow I got it into my brain that a completely discredited scientist by the name of Robert Oz was anything other than certifiably insane? Ancient history. Tell me why you failed today. Easy, Abe. He tried. Stop. Let him speak. Tell me why you failed. I don't know. Why don't you tell me, genius? Maybe the Mother Cell was contaminated. But it's-it's-it's hard, organic substance. So that's highly unlikely. Maybe the-the... cub's gene didn't mutate naturally like we thought it did, but there is no way that it traveled far enough to-to be exposed to Reiden, so that's a big fat no. If my hypothesis... is sound, a-and none of the elements were contaminated, then I don't know, maybe it's the-the... maybe it was the delivery system. The delivery system? Yeah. The... the injection. The-the... the needle, maybe the needle was contaminated. The... Or... Or what? (Sighs) Intramuscular injections usually disseminate quickly, but... but it's-it's possible that... it's possible it never even made it out of the dog's flank. And if it didn't make it out of its flank, then that means it didn't get to the brain... and maybe that's it, maybe... maybe we need to introduce it orally. (Dog barking) Maybe we need to do that before the cub's pack finds us. Do we have enough left? (Sighs) We're gonna find out. And, uh... don't think I don't recognize what you just did there. (Dog barking) (Barking) (Dog snarling, barking) Sorry, buddy. We need you one more time. (Snarling) Got him? Yeah. Yeah. (Snarling, barking) (Snarling) (Barking) (Snarling, barking continue) Mitch, I don't know. I don't think it's working. (Whines quietly, pants) (Whines, pants) (Dog whining) Good boy. Good boy. (Whines, whimpers) (Relieved sigh) (Laughs) You better find Jackson. We got to get this stuff home. (Electronic whirring, beeping) (Door unlocks) Sorry for the cloak-and-dagger. We haven't been properly introduced. My name is Amelia Sage. Those scientists didn't believe you, but I do. And so do the people who matter. (Quietly): Jackson? Jackson? Abe. (Panting): Abe. Ah. (Chuckles): How are you, man? I was so worried. I've said some things over the last few days... What you said... you were right. That little boy in there, the only thing that mattered to him was his brother. I've been a lousy brother. I made some dangerous choices. You tried to give your life for me. It was a dangerous choice, but a good brother. The cure? It worked. You were right. (Wry laugh) (Laughs softly) We got to get out of here. The lobby's this way. (Ferocious growling) (Quietly): Oh, my God. Don't move. (Growling) (Growling) Do we run? No. If we do, they'll take us down. (Leopard roars, growls) (Roaring, growling) (Glass shatters, gunshots) Soldier : Trank 'em! (Indistinct talking) Soldier 2 : Secure! Soldier 3 : Unit two secure! Extract! Soldier 4 : Lock it down. Secure the perimeter. How long have you know about the problem? Let's just say that two weeks ago this room... didn't exist. Amelia : Many of the things you said to the working group corroborate my team's discovery. The ocular change, for example. You call it the... Defiant Pupil. We call it the Delta Determinate. It's an anomaly of the Pax-6 gene, but a rose by any other name... We didn't know about the gene. We didn't have the resources. Well, you did just fine without them. My team's just started to research this problem. Your team is already close to a cure. Resources are the enemy of imagination. Einstein? Delavane. (Chuckles) Amelia : Well, Mr. Delavane, you'll be happy to hear that instead of facing criminal charges, your team is about to become heroes. Hopefully... the kind of heroes that can save the world. You're not alone. Not anymore. Mitch : Not that we're not incredibly grateful, but where the hell did you guys come from? Sergeant : We're the 74th Special Tactics Squadron. Our orders are to get you out of here. Okay, listen, there were two others with us. They're-they're still... Look! Jackson! You look like hell. (Chuckles) Thanks. Jackson : Hey, listen, up there with me, there were three... three kids. Already on their way to Nyanga. We'll track down their parents. How'd you know we were here? All I'm authorized to say is your location was provided by a French national. But we're gonna get you to Johannesburg, and from there on a flight to DC. I made a promise. Can you spare two men to take him back home? You serious? Yeah. Go on. Soldier : Let's move. Yeah. Let's go, let's go. Yeah. (Jet engines whirring) (Call system chiming) You know, I made a... great many promises to God in Zimbabwe. You gonna keep 'em? I think all but one. Did it involve women? (Chuckles): No, it involved hamburger. And it was made in haste on your behalf. I think you'll be making your own promises from now on. Oh... no, no, no, no. No. As soon as we land, hamburger, two cold beers... not negotiable. (Chuckles) Uh, please tell me that after everything we've been through, you guys aren't seriously gonna eat a hamburger. Oh, I'm eating the hamburger. (Chuckles) How's the cub? He ate half my dinner and fell asleep. Would you mind watching him for a sec? Hi. Hi. I was just pilfering some of these... adorable little bottles that haven't grown up yet. Would you like one? I would like nothing more. Well... Well, what? How many animals do you think have nearly eaten us? (Chuckles) Um... well, to be fair to them, they wouldn't have eaten us. They'd have just killed us. That's right. So... we did pretty good, right? Yeah. Well, considering we didn't have... (Thumping, rattling) Captain (over speakers) : Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We've been informed that due to some unusual migratory behavior, this airspace has been closed. We've been diverted to... What migratory behavior? (Passengers screaming)
