 Abraham :  For centuries, mankind has been the dominant species. We've domesticated animals, locked them up, killed them for sport. But a series of recent events seem to suggest all across the globe animals have decided: "no more." And so we were hired, a team of people from different backgrounds, with different specialities: an expert in animal behavior, a journalist, safari guide, foreign intelligence agent, and a veterinary pathologist. Our task: to find out what is happening with the animals, why it's happening, and how to stop it. 
 Previously on The plan on the table is to drop a version of Endrin on the bats. Endrin? You do realize you'd be risking the health of every single living thing in Rio. Over here. That's not Evan Lee Hartley. So where is he? The guy underlined every reference to animals in the Bible. I mean, every single one. I also found this. Chloe : That's Evan Lee Hartley. Jamie : Who's that standing next to him? That's my father. Think I almost got it. I can't even begin to understand what's happening right now. Do not. You're making a mistake. Leo :  The Mother Cell is in every single product Reiden makes. It's everywhere. It's all over the world,  and it can't be stopped. Listen to me. No, nobody is tricking you. Where is it? Chloe : Please, I can explain. An intelligence agent tries to bug my cell antenna, the explanation is obvious: Interpol. Chloe : We have no interest in your business. We needed your antenna to get rid of the bats. Mitch : She's telling you the truth. Says the American from the DEA. I'm a veterinary pathologist. You don't believe me? Well, I got the Presidential Award from the ACVP, a swell group of geniuses. You want to hear me talk about experimental mycoplasmosis in alligators? How about gallbladder adenocarcinoma in African lions? I'm not a DEA agent. Only thing I know about the drug war is that... drugs won. So, good for you. (indistinct chatter) I need to speak to Gabriela Machado. Now. Senhorita Machado. Mr. Kenyatta. We're about to drop the Endrin, the chemical to get rid of the bats. Now, I know Chloe wanted me to delay, but everything is falling apart... That's not why I'm here. Chloe and another colleague of mine have been taken by a man named Silva. Silva? Yes, do you know him? Gustavo Silva. He controls half the favelas. Drugs, weapons... I need your help. We have power outages in most of the city. Lootings, fires... Please. I have dealt with men like Silva before. I know this does not end well. Sargento. Gustavo Silva... he's taken a French DGSE agent, Chloe Tousignant. And an American. Dr. Mitchell Morgan. Where'd you last see them? At the Complexo do Alemao. Please, we need to find them. I'll send a squad. The bats must have hit our transformer. Excuse me. He's not even going to pass it on, is he? I'm sorry. I will do what I can, but... (plane buzzing past) They're dropping the Endrin. According to the scientists, it should work almost immediately. Is that what it's supposed to do? Mm. Mm-mm. Shafer : FBI. Give us a minute. Hey. You okay? No, I'm not okay. I lost it. You lost what? Leo and I were driving back. He had the Mother Cell out in the woods somewhere. It took forever, but... He was telling me about the boat he was gonna buy. And, uh... Something just rammed into us. The last thing I remember seeing is Evan Lee Hartley's face. Whoa... Are you sure it was him? He took it. He took the Mother Cell. Okay. We'll deal with it. It's gonna be all right. On what planet is it gonna be all right? I'm gonna call this in to the marshal's office. It's not your fault. All right? You're okay. That's the most important thing. No, it's not, Jackson. Evan Lee has the Mother Cell. And we have no idea what he's gonna do with it. ♪ ♪ ♪ If you are who you say you are, explain this to me. So, until yesterday, the mice would run when people came in through the door. Well... that, Mr. Silva, is a clear sign that things are working their way down the food chain. Is that the best that you can do, Mr. Veterinary Pathologist? The bats have developed some kind of biological imperative to attack technology. That's why they were going after the transformers. But they still have to eat, and what they eat is street mice. So these little guys... they probably think they're better off with us than with the bats. Mitch. The Endrin's not working. It's just getting worse. Please, we need to speak to the authorities. So you can help the rich people downtown? In Complexo do Alemao, I am the authority. I collect the garbage, provide the power, cell service. If there's a problem, I take care of it. Well, that's great. But we're trying to help you with this problem. Getting rid of the bats is what we were attempting to do before you kidnapped us. Oh. We may be able to draw them away if we can take your antenna. I lose cell service, it costs me 200,000 reais a day. Are you gonna make that up to me? Well, do you want us to do something or not? The antenna is not an acceptable option. (speaks Portuguese) (door locks) What did he say? If we don't find an answer, he'll kill us. (woman speaking French over phone message) (message ends) (screaming) It's Silva... he's coming. (screams) If we don't find a way to get rid of the bats, he's gonna kill us. Well, whose fault is that? Genius idea, trying to steal Don Corleone's antenna. We should have insulted his mother while we were at it. Well, you have a solution for me? Look, we can't do anything about the bats. Because we don't have any supplies. But if we did, we could build an electromagnetic pulse. What kind of supplies? an old PC, some copper wire, um, a speaker, and a steel rod or pole... about six, seven feet, maybe... and a couple of batteries. Big ones. Like out of a car. And... and a soldering iron. Do you want us to fix this or not? Flavio will get you your supplies. And then he will watch you. Good. Maybe he'll learn something. You should keep him on a tighter leash, your  veterinário. (lock clicks) What the hell were you thinking? We stay alive long enough for Abraham to find us. All I remember were his eyes. I couldn't stop staring at them because they were so strange. Come on, Jamie. Something. Which direction he went in, what he was wearing, something. I'm trying, okay? Yeah. (clears throat) (sighs) (clears throat) Uh, sweet teas. Three of 'em. Six bucks even. Great. Hey, do you have a recent photo of Evan Lee? Just on the fugitive notification. Yeah. Look at his eyes. They appear normal. And then here, his pupil is blown. Sometime after meeting my father, Evan Lee suffered the same mutation as those animals. You're telling me this is the reason he attacked those hunters? I don't know. Maybe. He was wearing a light-colored shirt. I remember because everything else was so dark. You didn't mention that before. You know, Jamie, there's a chance I can help you remember if, uh... if you're willing to try. (lock clicks) Oh. Welcome. (chuckles) Usually folks make an appointment, but... I think I can squeeze you in. Appreciate that. How can I help you? I want you to do something for me. (chuckles) I'm afraid I don't understand. You will. Shafer :  Now, I want you to relax. And breathe. (exhales) You've been in an accident. (tires screech) But you're okay. - Now, what do you see? I was hanging, because we were upside-down. And, um... and the steering wheel was kind of bent towards me. Then you hit your head on the passenger window. That, um... that must have hurt. Yeah. And my chest. Uh, uh, from the seat belt. It hurt to breathe. What else do you remember? Um... the... side mirror was broken. It was kind of just hanging. And then Evan Lee crouched down. Evan lee :  Where is it? He reached across me in the car, and he took the Mother Cell. And he walked around the front  of the car. And the windshield was cracked. And then I looked over and I saw Leo. When you looked over at Leo, could you see Evan Lee through the window? Yeah. He went and he got into his car. Car or truck? When you saw Evan Lee leave, did he... sit down into his car or... step up into it? (door shuts, engine starts) He stepped up. He stepped up. It was a truck. It was a big green truck. Good. And I was afraid he was gonna ram us again, but he didn't. He just... pulled in front of us and drove away. Which means you would have seen the license plate. I'm not sure. It's okay. Just... just try to remember. Those plates, Jamie, they would... start with letters. Three letters. K... KLL. KLL. Like "kill." You did great. (chuckles) All right, I'm gonna go run those plates. Hey. (door opens) (door shuts) We're gonna find him. Yeah. Swinney : You understand that if you want a sample from that part of the optic nerve, I have to go four inches into your skull. That's why I brought this. You're absolutely certain? The numbing drops, they... they have more of a su... Do it or I'll kill you. (growling) (grunting) (bear roars) (clattering) (snarls) (sniffing) (clattering) (roars) (panting) (snarling) (growling) (loud crashing) (bear growling) (indistinct chatter) Everything to the warehouse. Rápido. (grunting) What did you do with my friends? Nothing. Where are they? Where are they?! Silva has them. Then take me to Silva. Rápido. (dance music playing) Silva is not gonna wait much longer. I'm doing the best I can. But this music is driving me nuts. Hey, buddy, any chance we can get a little less Lambada, a lot more quiet? He doesn't speak English. Two weeks ago, my idea of danger was... rush hour on the 405. My sister does that... complains so no one sees how vulnerable she is. Maybe that's because I'm spending the last hours of my life building a $20 machine that's not gonna do a damn thing. That $20 machine is the reason why you're not dead already. We stay alive until Abraham can find us. That's a great idea, until Silva pushes the button on this contraption and expects bats to come. What? I've been looking at this backwards. Instead of a carrot, we need a stick. A stick? Instead of luring them away, we need to... we need to chase them out. Back in vet school, I had a... very hot professor who had a thing for bats. Details not important. Or appropriate. Anyway, I spent a very memorable night listening to her theories, one of which was high-pitched frequencies repel bats. If this thing has a joystick control board instead of an EMP, I can... I can... I can build an oscillator. It's a... it's a device that puts out a continual sound frequency. 
 
 Well... there it is. Flavio :  Uma hora. One hour, Mitch. Where is Silva? Where is your  chefe? You think I would take you to Silva? If you don't take me now, I swear on my life, I will pull this trigger. I see your eyes,  otário. I know Silva will kill me if I betray him. But you? (gun cocks) I don't think so. (phone rings) Answer. Dr. Swinney. Yes, Miss McClean, what can I do for you? The adjustable-focus reading glasses, uh... No, no, no. There's no need to come in right away. Have you tried, uh, turning the knob on the side of the frame? (sighs) Still not working. Then we'll have to set an appointment. Uh, but you have to believe me when I tell you, you can't come here now. Tomorrow at 9:00? Put it back in. Into what? Abraham : This doesn't have to happen. Please don't make me do this. Drop it. (gun fires) Take me to Silva. (beeps) Hey. Where you been? Finding Evan Lee. Or at least trying. The FBI can't, but you can. You know how many law enforcement officers there are in this country? About a million. You know how many dog lovers there are? I have no idea what you're talking about. 85 million. Look. I posted this to every social media site and local app I could find. "Looking for the man who killed my golden retriever and drove off in a green pickup. Louisiana plates start with KLL. Last seen: Mobile, Alabama." I'm not waiting for the FBI to find Evan Lee Hartley's truck. That son of a bitch nearly killed me. You are one clever cookie. You find anything in Leo's ledger? Yeah, the dates and locations where Reiden's Mother Cell product were used are consistent with pretty much all the infected animals we've seen. Louisiana, L.A., Slovenia... Brazil. What if there's nothing we can do about it? If there's nothing that we can do about it, then, uh, there's nothing that anyone can do about it... and my father was right, and the whole world goes to hell. (cell phone chimes) Oh, my God. Hmm? Someone spotted Evan Lee. Hey, there's Shafer. Hey. Hey. Why didn't you return my text? Oh, sorry, there's nothing to report yet. We haven't found Evan Lee. We did. That's it. That's his truck. All right, I want the two of you to go back to the hotel. (scoffs) No, the answer's no. Stay back. Both of you. Evan Lee has every cop in the country after him. What would he be doing here in the middle of town? He told his victim's widow that he was looking for a cure. But in Mobile? We know that his eye changed. We also know that he worked for my father who cut out the eyes of infected animals. Wait, you don't think he's gonna cut his eyes out, do you? I don't know, but I'm sure gonna find out. (strained grunting) Swinney : Hold still. Hold on. I'm almost done. (screams) Oh, my... oh, my... Shafer : Hey! Swinney : He made me do it. He made me do it! FBI. Back up. My name is Jackson Oz. Listen to me. You knew my father. Get away from me! Why'd you think this would cure you? Why'd you think this would cure you? Why'd you think this would cure you?! Did my father think it would cure the animals? Your father... did this to me. He's gone. Jamie : I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Jackson. But we got it. This could be the answer. I got to call this into the field office. Go. Go! I got this. Go! (bear grunts) (bear continues grunting) (bear growls) (screams) If your machine doesn't work, he's gonna kill us. Full disclosure: I'm not exactly hopeful that my awesome oscillator's gonna do anything but fizzle. Why do you do that? Because it's the truth. It's not the truth. It's what you choose to believe because it's easier than having hope. You hide behind logic. You think emotions are for the weak. But it's all a defense. Please don't pretend that it's not. You know, a long time ago, there was a point in time, I was... I was kind of a big deal. But ego is like having a hot girlfriend. Lot of maintenance. I published a study that wasn't fully cooked yet, and I got my ass kicked. So the truth is... I've been dead for three years. Today's just gonna make it official. You're not talking about your job. You're talking about your daughter. Her name is Clementine; she's ten years old. She was diagnosed three years ago. I read your file. I want to feel bad for you, but men who hide things... they become ugly. Well, you're good, aren't you? Wasn't that bad at first. She just... she got a little clumsy. But then... she started having seizures. A lot of kids with her syndrome, they... they lose their eyesight, and get... get different personalities, but not Clem. Clem's just dying. Why aren't you with her? 'Cause baby mama married a... decent guy when she was two, and I just decided to let them have their family. Until she got sick... and I started beating down the doors of every research hospital in the country. Then her mom put a stop to that. 'Cause it was, you know, too many doctors, too many tests. And all I was doing was-was robbing Clem of whatever life she was gonna have left. I'm pretty much out of the picture now. She's been through so much. Maybe she needs you. And maybe I've waited too long to reach out. Now that she's so sick, I don't... I don't want her to think that... I'm just doing it out of pity, you know? Out of pity. So... that's me. Secret dad. You know, there's an expression in French that says  "Rien ne pèse tant qu'un secret." "Nothing weighs more than a secret." I think you should talk to her. (phone ringing) Flavio :  Ola. Silva. Sim. Okay. Fechado. It must have worked. (snaps fingers) If the machines your friend had built would work, it wouldn't have come to this. If it had worked, you would have murdered them anyway. Our business is over. The man you are is not worth the man I would have to be to kill you. Don't come back to Rio. I tried to stop him,  chefe. (grunts) (coughs) (grunts) (high-pitched sound spooling higher) (sound oscillating) (dogs barking) We need to find Abraham. (dogs barking, howling) Why are the dogs howling? (barking, howling continue) They're reacting to the ultrasound frequency of the oscillator. (bats chirping) It worked. I mean, I want to think it worked, anyway. (barking continues) Oh. (laughs) Hey. (laughs) Hey. Where's Jackson? He's down in the coffee shop. Oh, what? No, uh, no celebrating? Well, there are mitigating factors. Now, come on. You have the evidence to take down Reiden, right? I guess it seems like it. So unless I'm missing something, it seems like your bad day turned out great. So, ask me... you should be doing something about that. You're just saying that because I'm wearing a towel. (laughs) I'm not gonna lie. You, uh, you are an excellent towel wearer. Oh. Among your other very fine qualities. Really? What would those be? Well, if I'm gonna list those, I should probably come in, 'cause it could take a while. Yeah. Uh... could you just give me a minute? Yeah. All right. (laughs) (laughs) I'll... I'll be here. (door closes) (hair dryer whirring) (Chloe speaking French over phone message) Chloe, it's me. We, found him, so as soon as you get this... News anchor : ...live at the crime scene. Police refuse to comment, but the possibility of murder-suicide has not been ruled out. ...call me. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Can you, uh, do me a favor and flip through the other local stations? Quickly, please? ...next week in Manila has canceled their trip? Because of the Mt. Hana volcano... Help yourself. Authorities have yet to identify the body of one man, but the second is confirmed to be Dr. Humbolt Swinney. Apparently, the bodies were discovered when a customer noticed broken glass outside of Dr. Swinney's door and called 911. (ringing) Ooh. As long as I'm buying, will you pour me a vodka? You bet. Uh, Jackson, hey. Now's not really a good time. Jackson : Jamie, listen to me. Ben killed the optometrist. Okay? He didn't call it into the field office. He killed him. What... I'm with Ben right now, actually. Maybe, uh... maybe we could all meet up later for dinner or... You are a terrible liar. Look... Jamie, I don't want to hurt you. Just give me the Mother Cell. Now. You son of a bitch. (grunts) (grunting) (grunting) Reiden paid you off, didn't they? Get off him, you son of a bitch. (laughs) Look, I... just want to hear her voice, okay? Justin : Mitch, you sure this is a good idea? Just for a minute. Justin, please. It's Mitch. Hi. Hey. I know I never do this, but, I'm just checking in. What's new? My dog Henry got hit by a car, but he's okay now. Well, I... maybe I should come see him sometime soon, huh? Sure. Maybe. Kind of... kind of like to see you, too. Okay. Uh... I gotta go. I have a doctor's thing. Okay. Listen, Clem... I gotta go. Okay. Bye. Bye. Cam I get a double vodka, please? Double vodka, coming right up. And put it on the blonde back there's tab. Drink now, 'cause who knows where we'll be tomorrow? Right? Your daughter? It's all good. So... what's next? I'm feeling kind of cocky after beating a bat plague with $20 worth of used hardware. Bring it. Rafiki. Who did this to you? It's, uh... it's a very long story, huh? I'll tell you later. Jamie : Chloe... What is it? They call it the Mother Cell. What the hell is a Mother Cell?
