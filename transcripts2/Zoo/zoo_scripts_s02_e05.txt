 Mitch :  A year ago, the animals started acting strangely, but no one noticed...  (growling)  until they began attacking, coordinating, evolving. The animals were mutating, and it was happening faster than anyone expected. 
 (screaming) 
 The government came up with a plan. 
 PSA narrator : Thanks to the Noah Objective, in six to ten years, the world's animal population will be thriving once again. 
 Killing the animals? Play God and repopulate the planet? 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Mitch :  But messing with Mother Nature could be catastrophic, so a group of us are trying to save the animals. 
 Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta, animal experts. 
 Chloe Tousignant, an intel operative. 
 Jamie Campbell, a reporter who's been following this story, found me, Mitch Morgan, a veterinary pathologist. 
 Together, we're going to find a cure for the animals. 
 Time is running out. 
 Previously on I compared your blood to our one-armed friend. You have the same mutilation. If I can save you, I can save the animals. I'm a dead man. And so are you if they find out  that we burned their money. Mason :  You have something that belongs to us. Where's my money? (Jamie whimpers) (slicing sound, Jamie grunts) (Mason groans) Chloe : This is how many animals they expect to eliminate with the Noah Objective. So General Davies knows his big animal solution will also kill millions of people. Jackson :  Best chance we have to stop him is inside the walls of Reiden Global. Our nations are facing a dark time. We must stop these animals. Chloe : That's the poison. There will be nothing to vote on if they can't do the demonstration. Dariela : Let's go! It's been hit. Run! (explosion, alarm blaring) (rumbling) (Chloe grunts) Jamie, she's in Caraquet. Chloe! Chloe! (alarm blaring) Damn it. Chloe! Female automated voice : Warning. Contamination detected. Air purification initiated. Chloe! Female automated voice : Warning. Contamination detected. Air purification initiated. (air whooshing) ♪ ♪ (air whooshing sound) Female automated voice : Air purification completed. Grab her. Come here. Come here, Chloe. Oh, my God. Straighten out her legs. Okay, Chloe? (grunts) Jackson : You're okay. You're okay. Okay? Shh. Chloe? Hey, hey. Here we go. (Mitch grunting) Come on. Come on. Breathe. Come on. Jackson : Come on, babe. Stay with me. (groans) Come on, come on, come on come on. (grunting) (gasping) Oh! Chloe! Oh, thank God. (door opens) Soldier : Come on. This way. Corridor B. Davies. We got to get her out of here. Okay. Let's go. Radio newscaster :  Antibiotics remain in short supply throughout the European Union as the animal uprising continues. I don't understand. Why aren't they saying anything about the leopard or the cure? Jamie... Just hold on. The ongoing border dispute... (radio turns off) Hey! Just let me get this out, okay? You don't have to... Jamie, I almost got you killed. I'm glad that Mason's dead. You did what you had to do, but... what happened back there, that's on me. Sorry that I got you mixed up in all of this. Doesn't matter, let's just get to Caraquet. Find a phone so I can call my friends. (engine sputters) Why are you slowing down? I'm not. Something's wrong. (engine sputters, turns off) Do you know what you're doing? Yeah, I rebuilt my first carburetor when I was ten. No! I know, it's hard to believe I'm actually good for something, but... No, look. This is not possible. Is that... Caraquet. You're fine. You got this, you're doing great. You're good. Trotter's preparing for takeoff. He said someone's been trying to contact us on the plane's secure channel. Don't answer. Secure or not, we can't risk letting Davies know where we are. (panting): Leave. What? Get her out of here, Abe. Rafiki... Get her out of here, Abe! Come on. Let's go help Trotter. Jackson : Yeah, come on, yeah. You're doing great. Come on, come on, you're all right. What is that? Adrenaline. (grunts) Yeah. She's okay. She's okay. You got it. What's going on? (weakly): Jamie... Did you find Jamie? Do you know... Do you know where she's at? Caraquet. Cara... Caraquet. Jamie's in Caraquet? (gasps) Cour... Courier... Courier? What's a "courier," baby? What do you mean "courier?" (heart monitor beeping) (heart monitor flatlines) No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Stay with me, No, you were doing good. You were doing good. You're right here, right? You're right here. Mitch, give her another shot. I can't. Her body can't take it. Then give her something else. (stammers) Give her something! There's nothing I can do! Come on. Come on, baby, you're doing great. Hey. But you... Hey! You had it. You had it. Hey. You're gonna be fine, sweetie. ♪ ♪ So the fuel gauge is busted. We've probably been running on fumes for the last 30 miles. (car door opens) What are you doing? I'm walking. Look, I'm as optimistic as the next guy, but you saw what I saw. There's nothing left. Caraquet's gone. Fine, stay here. (sighs) (chuckles) (sighs) (muttering) (sniffling) What? I just... (sighs) I just wanted to say how sorry I am. Tell me what happened. Tell me. One of Davies' men shot the gas canister. (voice breaking): It was leaking, so we ran. I thought Chloe was right behind me. But there wasn't enough time, and then the gas, it... it was spreading, so I... (sighs) I had to. You had to what? Jackson... Tell me. What'd you have to do? What did you have to do? I had to shut the door. I had to shut the door, there was no other choice. Couldn't have waited three seconds? I didn't have three seconds. You weren't there. I had to make a decision or all of us, everyone at the reception, we'd all be lined up beside her. So you say. Logan : How's your foot? Jamie : Foot's fine. We're almost there. Jamie, maybe we should go back. (roaring in distance) What is that? (roaring continues, leaves rustling) Run. What is that thing? I don't know. Let's not find out. (both panting) (chain fence rattling) (Logan groans) (Jamie grunts) Logan : Come on, I'll help you over. (grunts) (roaring intensifies) What the hell was that? (heavy breathing) This isn't happening. Jackson... No, uh, it-it's... none of it. It can't be. I'm... imagining it. I'm imagining all of it. I'm... She was trying to tell me something, Abe. What do you mean? Before she died, she was trying to tell me something about "The Courier." What is "The Courier"? I don't know, but it was important to her. (Abraham grunts) Oh... What the hell's that? Trotter. Trotter! (over intercom): It's not me. Someone else is flying the plane. What... what does that mean, somebody else is flying the plane? It must be Davies. Mitch : Well, how? He must have hacked our plane. (clunk, whirring) That's the landing gear coming down. Trotter : Everyone strap in. We're landing, whether we like it or not. (indistinct chatter) (Jamie coughs) (coughing) What were you doing out there? Trying to stay alive. What the hell's outside the fence? Where did you come from? About 40 kilometers south. Is anyone else with you? What's up with the interrogation? You want to take the bass out of your voice, son, or have me knock it out? Jamie : Whoa. What happened to Caraquet? The fires. Did the animals do that? No. We did. There's nobody out there. We're almost at the end of the runway. I don't see anything. No. (Dariela exhales) Stuff this in your ears and cover your eyes when they breach. Why? Flashbangs. Two through the door. Then they come in shooting. That's what I would do. Flank the door. Get behind cover now. (rifle clicks) Hit 'em as soon as they come through that door. Don't let 'em hit first. Hold your fire. Please don't shoot. That goes double for you. Who the hell are you? This could've all been much simpler if you'd just picked up on the secure channel. We installed an emergency override just in case I ever needed to take remote control of my plane. Your  plane? Yes. Mine. Hello, Mitch. Allison. You two know each other? She's my stepmom. I'm Gwen. You'll have to excuse Curtis. We don't get many visitors. Well, what happened here? Well, Caraquet was overrun five months ago. By the time the military arrived, we'd lost hundreds of people. They planned to evacuate us in three weeks. The first wave included the injured and infirm. But the soldiers never came back. Word is, they all went home to save their kin and head for the hills. We've been on our own ever since. What about the fires and the smoke? That's to keep the animals away. We burn around the clock. We ran into something out there. Something big. To be honest, most of us haven't been outside in months. Logan : How do you get food and supplies? The school was the town's emergency relief center. Lucky for us, it was stocked before the attacks. So do you have a sat phone? Or a radio? We don't. Sorry. We have a doctor. Urologist, but, uh, I'll have him come by and take a look at your foot. Oh, thank you. But first, get changed. You will feel better with some clean clothes and a shower. You have running water? And a temperamental water heater. But the good news is, you're safe. Welcome to Caraquet. Let's just start over, shall we? My name is Allison Shaw. I'm the Deputy Secretary of Defense and, yes, I was married to Mitch's father. Somebody else want to talk now? Jackson : I do. We've been flying around on your stepmother's plane and you didn't think to tell us? Keeping secrets like this... Mitch had no idea. I made sure of it. We haven't spoken in... 12 years. 12 years. So why now, Allison? What do you want with us? Why'd you bring us here? With Amelia gone and Eleanor gone, there's fewer of us left. We need to work together. We have to. My family owns the largest orchard on the West Coast, and our trees are all dying. I need your help to stop it. You just said that you work for the Pentagon, so why would you need our help? Because the government can't know anything about this. If Davies finds out that our food source is threatened, he'll use it to leverage additional resources to the Noah Objective. You're the only ones that I can trust. So... Chloe's dead. Jamie's in some Canadian... Wait, Chloe's... Chloe's dead? What happened? We disrupted General Davies' event in Vancouver and... I'm sorry. Jackson : Can you just back that up for a second? You knew Chloe? She and Eleanor were the only ones who knew that I was behind your team. I've been secretly working against Davies, trying to find an alternative to the Noah Objective. Well, then, let us go find that alternative, okay? Because that's what Chloe wanted. Allison : Please. I need you to come with me to my orchard. You know, we're not gonna go anywhere with you. You can keep your stupid plane. We'll find another way to get Jamie and find a cure. What he said. Did Chloe ever mention "The Courier"? Jackson : Yeah. Yeah, she did, right... What the hell do you know? You save my family's orchard, and this plane is yours, no strings. And I'll tell you everything. (indistinct chatter) Hey. Hey. How was the shower? Uh, freezing. And wonderful. (laughs) You're skinnier than I'd imagined. (chuckles) 'Cause of the parka. It's, like, three sizes too big for you. Not that I was imagining anything... I'm gonna stop talking. (laughs) 
 
 Man : Hey. Where did you get that? Excuse me? That sweatshirt. Why do you have it? Easy, man. It's not yours. Uh, well, Gwen gave it to me... Is there a problem here? Yeah, this guy's hassling Jamie about the sweatshirt that you gave her. Is that true, David? I-I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I... My bad. What's his problem? We've been here a long time. Some have adjusted better than others. Allison : This time of the season, these branches should be heavy with fruit, but everything's stunted. It's stopped growing. It's the same story all over the area. And it's spreading. Look at this stuff. What are you? It looks like glass to me, so that's what we've been calling it. It poisons the trees. Soaks in through the roots. It's in the soil throughout the entire property. Man : I've been working here half my life and I've never seen anything like it. At this rate, we won't produce a tenth of our normal yield. Damn. Allison : With no one eating meat anymore, fruit is more important than ever. If this continues to spread, hundreds of thousands of people will starve. And you think that an animal is behind this glass? Well, it's not plant-based. And given your work connecting mutated animals to environmental events... If there is a connection, we'll find it. (zips bag closed) Then we can get the hell out of here. (insects trilling) (slithering) (wet slithering) (coughs, grunting) Oh, Bill! Bill! Well, it's not glass. Thought that part was obvious. Right. But bet you wouldn't have guessed it's organic. Cellular structure's a lot like skin... with, uh, traces of toxic residue that are definitely animal-based. Well, what animal do you think it's from? I don't know yet. But if we're gonna make it to Caraquet, I better figure that out quick. Right? Oh. You're not here to talk about toxic glass, are you? All right, look. If you want to talk about Allison... Last night, when I was saying good-bye to Chloe, um... I started crying... Yeah. Well... black tears. They were thick, almost like oil. Anybody see this? No. You're displaying the same symptomology as Kovacs. Right before he escaped, I saw the same thing. It was black tears. So what does that mean, that I'm progressing? I'm one step closer to him? Okay, I get it. It's your plane. You've got to learn to knock. Not now, Mitch. Please, it's Bill. You have to help him. (gagging) Bill's wife : He's in here. What's wrong with him? (groans loudly) Help him! Bill, hey. Look at me. Can you speak? Try Dr. Miller again. Hurry. (Bill groaning) Can you speak? No. Jackson : Whoa! Allison : Bill? (gagging, groaning) Is that the stuff from the orchard? Bill? (groaning) (hissing) Allison : Mitch? Help him, for God's sake! We gotta pull it out. Hold him. We got to pull it out! Go, grab it! God! (groaning) (snake hissing) Bill? (wheezing) Bill? I keep seeing her face through the glass. When I turned back, Chloe wasn't behind me. Just a wall of gas. I didn't want to close that door. But I did. And then her face was there. I'm sorry. But when I look at you now, all I see is the fact that Chloe is no longer with us. And I have to live with that. You get the feeling like we're the new kids in school? Jamie : Yeah, except all the teachers are freaks and the students are weirdos. I'd stay away from the mashed potatoes. Uh, they look good to me. Looks can be deceiving. They-they make 'em with rutabaga. There's a lot of rutabaga up here. Um... Jamie : Ooh. Woman : Oh... crap, I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. Run. What? First chance you get, run. Curtis : Maddie. What happened here? Clumsy me. I, uh... I swear my hands are still numb from the cold. Can you get Jamie another plate? Sure thing, Curtis. Clean this up, will you? Sorry. At least now we know it's poisoning the trees. That stuff he threw up, the glass, same stuff we saw in the orchard. Snake shed it like molted skin. Given the amount of glass we saw in the orchard, there must be thousands of snakes. So where are all the snakes hiding? Snake came in through the toilet, right? It certainly looks like it. I think I got an idea. This is the aquifer that runs underneath your property. It supplies water to all the farms in the county. My thought is that the snakes are shedding their toxic glass directly into your farm's water supply. What about the drinking water? The county draws it from the river, so at least we don't have to worry about contamination. But we do. Your aquifer feeds into tons of other public water sources for hundreds of miles. Your farm is only the beginning. So these snakes, they're going to poison the entire Pacific Northwest. Jackson : Countless innocent people are gonna be drinking poison directly from their kitchen sinks unless we do something. So how do we stop it? Poison them. Before they poison us. Hey. You shouldn't be back here. Why did you tell us to run? 'Cause you're gonna end up outside the fence anyway. Might as well have a chance. What are you talking about? Tonight is another vote. Vote? Yeah. What are they voting on? The feeding. "The feeding?" What the hell is that? Gwen : You'll find out soon enough. I'm disappointed, Maddie. No! Hey, hey. No. Maddie : No! (men grunting) (grunting, clattering) (grunting continues) Glad to see you still have some fight in you. You're gonna need it. Both of you. Just tell me how it will work. I'd rather not. Mitch, you are using my lab to make a poison that you want to dump into the water supply, so just lose the misunderstood misanthrope act and tell me how it will work, or I will shut it down. I've never known anybody who threatens to take their ball away and go home more than you do. Mom. I would've thought by now you wouldn't let personal issues get in the way of, well, saving the world. Personal? You made it personal. We were finally on our way to go get Jamie. You come and yank us out of the air. Damn it, Mitch, I brought you here. I gave you this lab, this plane, because I believe in you. Eleanor sent me dozens of alternatives to the Noah Objective. I passed on all of them until I saw your name. All of this is because I know you better than anyone. You're the best at what you do, you just needed someone to back you up. So tell me, did I bet on the right horse? (clears throat) The vomeronasal organ. Also known as Jacobson's organ. (sighs) It's a sort of... primitive olfactory receptor. It sits in front of the brain. When a snake flicks its tongue, it's gathering particles to process through its Jacobson's organ. This formula, when ingested, will cause that organ to swell. Till it presses against the brain, shutting off all the snake's... bodily functions. How do we know that it won't hurt humans? (sighs) (smacks lips) We good? Yeah. 'Cause I got to make a whole bunch of this stuff. - Mm-hmm. (hissing, clattering) (hissing) Allison : Oh, my God. (hissing continues) (stammers) Uh... we got a problem in here. Are you okay? (hissing, rattling) Oh. Uh, for the moment. Where's the poison? Einstein over here drank it. You did what? I was making a point. I'll get the tranqs. I got this. Jackson... Easy. Easy. (loud hiss) You sure you want to do this? Easy. Abraham : Rafiki. My God. Rafiki, how did you... We should talk. Allison : Give me the formula for the poison. I'll have my guy start synthesizing it. And then we can leave for Caraquet? Yes we can. "We?" You can explain on the way. Tomorrow another feeding is upon us. So, tonight we vote. Why do we have to vote? Can't we just feed those two to the animals? We all agreed to abide by the vote. You don't have to do this. Help is coming. Gwen : I wish that were true. But we've all learned that we need to help ourselves. We guarantee the safety of the many with the sacrifice of a few. Do you really think that you've made some kind of deal with what's out there? We do. How else to explain that we're still here? Since we began the feedings, we've had no unexpected attacks. Which is why it must continue. Let's just vote, Gwen. Okay. Nominations. I nominate the girl. Jamie. Logan : Wait a minute. I'll go with Jamie. Any seconds? All : Aye. We need another. I nominate Maddie. Jamie : No. She's just a child. Who's subject to the vote like everyone else here. Any seconds? All : Aye. Logan : No! Just take me! No, that's okay. I'd rather be eaten by wild goats then spend another second with you monsters. Gwen : Jamie and Maddie. All in favor. All : Aye. Opposed. You people, you're crazy! Enough. It's been decided. Tomorrow morning... this month's feeding will commence. My mom used to teach here. Art. She was a total hippie. (chuckles, then sniffles) Always wanted to teach children the beauty in the world. What happened to her? Instead, it was the animals. I'm sorry. (choked up): Yeah. It's probably better she never saw any of this. There's nothing beautiful left in Caraquet. Well, Caraquet... the world... is not what it used to be. But you cannot give up. There's nothing we can do. The Feeding's in a few hours. I mean... Don't be so sure. Abraham :  Why did you not tell us this before? I wanted to. Chloe and I shut it down. But why? What if he goes berserk and starts attacking people, like Kovacs did? She's right. Is it even safe for Jackson to be here? Well, like it or not, I have to be, because without me, you have no cure. All right. There's something you all should see. This is the DNA molecule we all came to know and love in high school biology. Double helix. Two strands of genetic information, elegantly entwined together. This... is what Jackson's DNA looks like. The mutation has caused it to develop a third strand. A Triple-Helix? And this structure isn't unique to just Jackson. He shares it with the vultures, the ants, the sloth, the snakes. Abraham : So... tell us about the cure. Okay. Well, Jackson is the key. Because this Triple-Helix structure isn't the only thing his DNA shares with these animals. They also share genomic fossils. Extinct genes. Genetic instructions that were silenced millions of years ago, thought to be non-functional until now. If you think of the rungs on a ladder, each rung contains genomic fossils from a different animal. If I can identify each one, and its animal source, I should be able to come up with a cure and reverse the mutation. You already know four, right? And they all check out. So that leaves us three more animals to identify and capture. Once we've identified all seven genomic fossils, I should be able to eliminate that third strand. Dariela : Sounds like you got your work cut out for you. We could use your help. Be good to have you with us on the team. What do you say? Copy that. Nice pep rally in there. Wasn't a pep rally. It's, uh, it's the truth. I'm glad you're gonna stay with us. I know you are. But you don't want me on the team because of the way I make blueberry pancakes or to borrow my hip-hop mix tape. You want me here to put a bullet in your head if you end up like Kovacs. That's right. Mitch, Abe... they won't be able to. But I can. Because... Yeah. Because I shut the door on Chloe. Maybe you're right. Maybe I did have three seconds. Maybe not. I hesitated. Maybe if I hesitated more, Chloe would be alive. But you... you go sideways, like the monster that killed my friends? I won't hesitate. That's a promise. He's so cute. Man : Oh, yes. Can I touch him? Absolutely, madam. Man : You know, I think he wants you to have this. Chloe : Oh, does he? Man : Ah, yes, madam. This is the symbol Osram Ne Nsoroma. It means "the moon and the star." Love. Harmony. Harmony. I think we could all use a little bit more harmony, you know? How are you doing? (sighs) Thanks. Chloe never stopped believing that she could fix this. It's all she wanted. It's what she died for. And she's never gonna be able to see it. I remember when I was a little boy, at my grandmother's funeral. When all the mourners sang, I asked my papa "What's the point of singing these songs if Grandma cannot hear it?" What did he say? He said the songs are not sung for those we sing to, but for the singer. I want to see that world again, Abe. You will. To Chloe. To Chloe. Jamie! Hey. Hey, whoa! Jamie : Stop it! Can I at least say good-bye? Go ahead. Gwen! Please, please, please! This isn't fair, please... I will do anything! Please, I will do anything! Take this. Throw it in one of the barrels by the fence. Gwen, please! No! This isn't fair! This isn't... (sobs) Let's go. Please! Unlock it! Gwen : Open the gate! Maddie : No! Help! (Maddie screams) Stop! (Maddie screaming) No! (sobbing): No! Stop! Stop! (screams) (gate clangs shut) We're not done here. I think we are. Did it work? I hope so. (loud snarling) (people screaming) (screaming) Are you okay? Yeah. (screaming) The bus. (snarling) See if you can find the key. Let me in! Jamie, let me... Jamie, please, please! (snarling) No. Jamie! Let go! (roars) (screams) (Gwen screaming) (screaming stops) (growling) Take Maddie out the back. Where are you going? I'm gonna draw 'em the other way. What? Like hell you are. I brought you to Caraquet, and I'm gonna get you out. Go. (bears growling) Hey! How many people are in the school? Oh, my God. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
