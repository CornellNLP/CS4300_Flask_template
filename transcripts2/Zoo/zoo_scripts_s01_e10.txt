 Abraham :  For centuries, mankind has been the dominant species. We've domesticated animals, locked them up, killed them for sport. But a series of recent events seem to suggest all across the globe animals have decided: "no more." And so we were hired, a team of people from different backgrounds, with different specialties: an expert in animal behavior, a journalist, safari guide, foreign intelligence agent, and a veterinary pathologist. Our task: to find out what is happening with the animals, why it's happening, and how to stop it. 
 Previously on We got it. This could be the answer. They found the Mother Cell. And they think they can use it to make a cure. That's a shame, if they want to live to find out if they're right. (snarling) I think these lions are communicating with each other. Long distance. (roars) Dogstick : FBI! Ben Shafer was a friend of mine. She shot him in self-defense. He tried to kill us. Dogstick :  Why would he do that? He was dirty. Ah! (grunts) Run! Âª ♪ (lock buzzes, clanks) Load 'em up... Ray's right behind us with more. (growling, grunting) We gotta go. Wait, Jackson... there's more animals. Gotta go. Security's closing in on us. Chloe and I got what we came for. We got trouble! Head to the truck! Hey! Hey! Stay right there! Get down! Don't move! Ray, don't! (gunshot) Jackson : What about the guy who made Jamie's fake I.D.? Chloe :  No. With the authorities  looking for us, we can't risk it. I mean, if we were not in such a hurry, we could take a freighter. Yeah, I would give anything for a cruise to Africa right about now. Yeah. Thanks. You're welcome. Electro-what? Electroporator. We're gonna need one, once we find the leopard, to combine its stem cells with the Mother Cell. Jamie : Wait. Jackson, we saw one of these. Jamie : in Mobile the optometrist's office. Yeah. Evan Lee Hartley thought it would help cure him. Makes sense. Electroporators are used to introduce new coding DNA. So we're probably not gonna find one in the wilds of Africa. No. So we'll have to take one with us. And it's not like we can just swing by a convenience store and pick one up. It's a highly specialized piece of equipment. Where do we find one? Genetics labs. Certain hospitals. So we can add that to our list of impossible stuff to do. Well, no one said saving the world is gonna be easy. Host : ...think there's something we should be afraid of? Abraham : Hey, guys... Listen to this. CDC official : Afraid, no. Cautious, perhaps. The CDC is, however, looking into the matter. We've heard enough reports about aberrant animal behavior that we're considering the possibility of a virus. It's not a virus. Host : What can the people at home do? CDC official : If you notice any odd behavior in your pet, see your local veterinarian. Well, that was helpful. So... I got a question. If we keep driving south, straight through Florida, eventually we're gonna run out of Terra firma. That's it. Florida. Florida? Jackson : Let's go to Clearwater. Why? I mean, never in the course of human events has Clearwater, Florida ever been the solution to anything. Well, today it is. In Clearwater, there is a way to get back to Africa. What's in Clearwater? Oh, no. You're thinking about Ray, aren't you? Yes, I am. No. Not that. Not Ray. Who's Ray? (sighs) He's a nightmare. (grunts) Come on, Baggo. I think there's been a misunderstanding... Can you at least take off the high school ring, sport? I know how proud you are that you have made it as far as high school. (grunts, gasps) Oh! There they are! All the way from Africa to defend my honor! See you're still as popular as ever, Ray. Meet my pals, David and Goliath. Bet you didn't know they reconciled and now they wander the globe doing the good work. This gotta stop, Ray. Gotta stop now. Yeah, yeah. Abraham : What did he do? Released 200 pounds of caught shrimp from our holds. And that's the fourth time this month he's done it. Tell me something. You know what "bycatch" is, fellas? Sharks, sea turtles, seals and other "non-target" fish that end up in these bastards' nets, only to be tossed overboard because "they ain't shrimp." It's our living. And your friend here is trying to ruin it. He's not our friend. This ain't over, Ray. I'll see you soon. Gotta say, I was surprised to hear from you. Figured you were still sore about Nairobi. You almost got us killed in Nairobi. Hell, those poachers were bad men. And you were on the right side of right. Raymond Joseph Endicott. No past, no future. My name is Chloe Tousignant. It is very nice to meet you, Chloe. Tell me something. What are you doing here with my old friends, huh? Like I said, we're not your friends. You still making that Africa run, Ray? Yeah, now and again. We need to get out of the country. The five of us. Off the books, under the radar. How soon do you need to leave? As soon as possible. That'll cost you. How much? More much than you've got, if you're showing up on my doorstep. See, here's the thing, Chloe. I'm what you would call a, uh, well, a last resort for Boy Scouts like these two. So it will cost you much-much. Or maybe nothing at all. What's that mean? Ray : My associates and I are doing a little something-something tonight. We could use the manpower. Is what you do against the law? Not if you're a zebra in a cage. No. No way. (clicks tongue) Suit yourself. And if we do help you? Then it's simple. You wash my back, and I fly yours the hell out of the country one step ahead of whoever it is that's chasing you. What is it that you and your associates are doing? We're breaking into Clearwater Zoo. To liberate the animals. Of course you are. Jamie :  Okay, so who's this friend of yours? He is not our friend. He's an ex-Marine, an animal rights activist, and he spends a lot of time in Africa, interfering with poachers. That's how Abe and I met him. He's crazy. Jackson : He's not crazy. He's... he's just... not uncrazy. Chloe : His group calls themselves the Free Animal Rights Militia. F.A.R.M. That's... clever. I've dealt with these kind of people before. They're zealots. Don't know the first thing about animal welfare. Well, not to mention some of us are already wanted by the police. Maybe committing another crime doesn't help our case. Well, I agree, but we gotta get out of here, and we gotta get out of here fast. I admit, okay? Ray... Ray can be a bit of a loose cannon. Okay. Maybe more than a bit. But everything he has ever done has been for the animals. Look, I know desperate times require desperate measures... but this isn't desperate. This is... reckless. Chloe : I understand your reservations, Abraham, but I'm with Jackson. I don't really think we have a better option. Look, no offense, Chloe, but you don't know Ray Endicott. This is a terrible idea. Dogstick : ...the prime suspect in the murder of FBI Special Agent Ben Shafer... I gotta say, I'm with Abe... ...meaning I'm anti-doing this thing with these... losers. But... I'm just gonna put this out there: We could probably get an electroporator from that zoo. We could? Mie'tch : Clearwater Zoo has a pathology lab, which means they most likely have one. Even so... Abraham : Guys! Dogstick : Jackson Oz... Hey, guys, come in here! ...Chloe Tousignant, Abraham Kenyatta and Mitchell Morgan. These four people are all possible accomplices in Agent Shafer's murder. We're asking anyone who has seen them or who has any information concerning their whereabouts, to please step forward and contact us on our special hotline. Well, all of our names and faces are out there now. The chances of us getting recognized... getting caught... just quadrupled. I'll take some questions now. Chloe : Your friend is truly the only hope we've got. (reporters shouting questions on TV, cameras clicking) He is not our friend. Ray : All right, so we've hit up a couple of zoos before. We found what works best for us is a two-pronged assault, so four of us are gonna go in here, four of us in here. Toss in a couple of flash-bangs, and the rent-a-cops won't know what hit 'em. Flash-bangs? Seriously? Mitch : The etymology of the term "gung ho" comes from the Chinese meaning "work together," but I find it can also mean: "excitable morons groping for a cause." You kidding me, man? My friend, I wouldn't if I was you. Who are these guys again, Ray? These are some old chums of mine, who are presently of the mind that animals are uniting against us. Which we deserve, by the way. Good for them. I mean, we have been eating 'em and keeping 'em in cages since the dawn of time. All right, how about we just focus on what it is we're trying to do here. Okay, look, once we're in, one of your people can go fetch the, uh, velociraptor thing from the path-lab. Electroporator. Sure, that. Rest of us are gonna free the animals, load 'em into the truck. We're in and out in under 30 minutes. What if we try a different approach? Yeah, like the one where we don't break into the zoo to free the animals. What, you think this is funny? Oh, there's nothing funnier than adrenaline junkies trying to mask their thrill-seeking in altruism. Zoos are an idea whose time have come and gone. Tell that to the dozens of endangered species who have benefited from captive breeding programs. All right, relax, relax. Anissa did a couple of tours in Afghanistan, took some mortar fire. Unfortunately, doctors couldn't save her sense of humor. Chloe : Jackson? You were saying? I was thinking that maybe we try more of a stealthy approach. One where we get in and out without security even knowing we're there. And how do you propose that? We have a secret weapon. Oh, you do? Jackson : We do. Him. You gotta be kidding me. Well, as it turns out, Miss Jarhead, I know a thing or two about zoos. And Jamie knows a thing or two about getting information from people. I understand, Dr. Mills, but it's against our policy to grant access to our CCTV feed. Jamie : Don't tell me that you understand. If you understood, I wouldn't be wasting my time explaining to you why I need access to those feeds. Look, here's the deal: I am at a conference, but I'm also in the middle of a very important experiment at the zoo. Now, my assistant was supposed to oversee it, but he got appendicitis, so I have to be in two places at once. I need you to do this for me. I could just call your supervisor, uh... Hank Lowenthal. Hank? You know Hank? Oh, Hank... (chuckles) Hank and I are old friends. His wife and I are in a book club together. She just... she loves her John Grisham. Should I call him? No, no, it's okay. Um... I'm sending you the log-in information right now. Thank you, thank you. I really appreciate this. I will make sure that I tell Hank how helpful you've been. Oh, and, uh, just make sure that you send it to that e-mail address I gave you. Will do, Dr. Mills. Okay. I don't know about this. About what? What? This, the cameras, everything. But this part was your idea. I know, but... look, it should work, it should work... but what if it doesn't? Well, if it doesn't, I'm gonna be breaking into a zoo with a bunch of nut-job radicals, and nobody's gonna have my back. But I'm not worried about that, you know why? Why? 'Cause I have faith in you. Man : Got what you wanted. Jamie : Okay. So how's this supposed to work? Well, I have access to all the security camera feeds at the zoo. Right now, I'm logging in to the camera that looks at the zebra enclosure. Okay. So that goes here. I see what the security camera sees. And this one looks at the reptile house, so it goes there. So you're gonna be our eyes and ears when we're inside the zoo? Yeah, I'll know where y68ou are, and I'll give you a heads up if there's any security guards coming your way. Seems... complicated. Yeah, it is. No, it isn't. You got this. She's got this, right? You got this. You know, we usually just cut all the wires. Which will deactivate the security and the camera systems. We need the cameras active so Jamie can advise us as to any security guards. All right, look, I think it's red. Red's the alarm, blue's security cameras. (sighs) (phone line ringing) Hey, Jamie. How's that? Good job. All the cameras are still up. Okay, tell Mitch and Chloe that the alarms have been deactivated. Will do. That's a lucky guess. Be ready. Roger that. Here you go. Really? The lion? Oh. Yeah. Open it up, Abe. (lock buzzes, clanks) Cody, stay by the truck. I'm gonna stick with Anissa, while Mitch and Chloe get the electroporator. Guys, the corridor to the pathology lab is clear. Chloe (whispering) : Thanks, Jamie. Mitch : I got this. Worked at four zoos in my career. The first one just kept the factory default code. Of course, that was a petting zoo. Great. What did the second zoo use? Ah, yes. Good work. Good luck. We tried liberating a few zebras from a zoo in Tampa, a few years ago. Ornery sons of bitches wouldn't go. Guys, you just gotta know how to approach them. Zebras scare easy. Come at 'em straight... they don't think you're trying to sneak up on 'em. Hey. Yeah. It's okay. (indistinct radio chatter) Jackson? I've got a guard heading straight for you. Hide now. Jackson, the guard is 50 feet away. Jackson? Jackson : I gotta move slow, so I don't spook the zebra. Good, good. Âª ♪ Guard (over radio) : Sector four is clear. Mitch, Chloe, how you doing? Not terribly well. (keypad buzzes) Come on! Mitch : Hang on. _ The last zoo I worked at used the name of their star attraction. G-I-L-B-E-R... ...T. (keypad blips) Et voilà. Load 'em up... Ray's right behind us with more. Come on, he's got it. Let's go. (growling, grunting) You said it was about the size of a toaster, right? Yeah, with a digital display and a couple of knobs. Something like this? Exactly like that, yes. Grab that other piece. Come on, let's get out of here. (growling, grunting) Jackson, I got another guard heading to the lion enclos... Wait a second. What does that mean, "wait a second"? Jamie : Oh, no. That doesn't sound good. Jackson, I got two of the feeds crossed. You have to get out of there right now. I've gotta get the others. Where are they? They're at the aviary. Jackson : We gotta go. Anissa : Wait, Jackson, there's more animals. Gotta go; security's closing in on us. Mitch : Chloe and I got what we came for. Jackson : We got trouble! Head to the truck! Ray : What kind of trouble? Jackson : No time to explain. Now, go! Hey! Hey! Go back, go back, go back! Hey! Hey! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Guard : Hey, stay right there! Chloe : We're surrounded, Jackson. Take off the masks. Jackson : Put away your guns. We're unarmed. Guard : Take the masks off! Take 'em off! Don't move! Cody, don't! (groans) 
 
 Guard : Take cover! Anissa : Ray! (Ray groans in pain) Jamie : What happened? Ray got shot and Cody is dead because we didn't have backup we could count on. That's what happened. "Backup you could count on"? Nobody said anything about guns. Nobody said anything about guns! Everybody calm down, all right? We can point fingers later. (Ray murmuring) Okay, Jamie, help us. Why didn't you take him to the hospital? Because if he goes to the hospital, then he goes to prison! Besides, your friend says he can help him. You can? I hope so. Otherwise GI Jane here is gonna put me down. Anissa : Okay, okay, what do you need me to do? Just get me whatever first aid supplies you have around here, okay? Anissa : Got it! Sharpest knife you can find. Ok. (Ray grunting in pain) And a lighter to sterilize it. Grab some rope or electrical cord, whatever you got. The plane... Where is it? The plane? We had a bargain. Yeah, I know. And we still do, all right? But right now, I'm worried about my friend. Oh, God, is he... He's passed out. From the pain. Probably better that way. Okay, here, tie him to the table. Why? 'Cause this is gonna get rough. Ray's in good hands. His bedside manner notwithstanding, if Mitch says he can help him, he can. Look, I know where the plane is, but it's not gonna do you any good. Why not? Because Ray's your pilot. I just got a call that there was a break-in. Clearwater, Florida Zoo. They took a bunch of animals. What kind of animals? Uh, zebra, camels, water buffalo... How many bad guys? Seven that we know. That doesn't sound like our crew. The zoo's breeding lab was broken into as well. Anything taken? Just a piece of equipment... something called an electro... porator? Electroporator? Yep. Whatever the hell that is. Oh, I know what that is, Agent Singer. What? That is reason to book my travel to Clearwater, Florida. You sure you can handle this? I can fly a cargo plane. I've done it before. You can say it, you know. Say what? "I told you so." You don't need me to tell you that getting involved with Ray was a bad idea... you know that on your own. I do. And I also know that there's something else you want to say to me. All right, yes. I've seen you make foolish mistakes before. Like when you let Ray drag us into that mess in Nairobi. Or picking a fight with those two brothers in Mombasa. There are poor decisions, and then there is today. These are the same kind of ill-advised judgments you always said your father exhibited. (engine starts) Bullet's in a bad place. This isn't gonna be pretty. You ready? Okay. Hold him down. (grunting) (gasps) (grunting continues) No, you're okay, you're okay. (shouts) You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be okay. What the hell is wrong...! Okay... (grunts weakly) (grunting stops) So, what's the deal with you and Ray? What do you mean? It seems like y'all don't get along too good. Ray is trouble. Always has been, always will be. That's just not true. Look, when I met Ray, I was in the Corps, and at the time, he was pairing former bomb-sniffing dogs with disabled vets... giving them both... something to live for, you know? Yeah, that's lovely. I'm just... saying he's a good guy. Let me tell you how  I  met Ray Endicott. Go for it. Ray booked a spot on one of our safaris, like any other guest... only he wasn't any other guest. He was using our safari as a cover to scope out poachers in the area. What's wrong with that? I figure you'd be anti-poacher. Of course I am. But then, when Ray later sabotaged the poachers, they traced him back to us... and they put quite a beating on Jackson. If I hadn't arrived, they may have killed him. Then there was the time that Ray had a shipment of weapons delivered to our business. We were almost arrested for being arms traffickers. And then... there was my favorite Ray Endicott adventure: Nairobi. I see you've heard of this one. He may have mentioned it. You see, Ray had convinced Jackson to accompany him to Nairobi to put an end to a particularly proficient group of big-game hunters. Wait, just Jackson, not you? I wanted no part of it. But then, I learned they had walked into a trap. Ray had become such a thorn in the paw of these hunters, that they wanted to get rid of him, so... naturally, I had to go to Nairobi. You know, you should hear the way Ray tells that story. The way he tells it, you're the big hero. Came in, guns blazing, took him and Jackson to safety. "Guns blazing." Yes. They blazed. It was awful. My point is, Ray is a magnet for trouble. If trouble needs a place to stay for the night, it will usually find a room with Ray Endicott. You ever think that maybe it's not Ray? What do you mean? I'm just saying... you ever think maybe it's your boy Jackson? Ray's not the only person in those stories. You know, maybe it's Jackson that's the magnet for trouble. What are you doing? (sighs) For the animals. (screwing top onto container) You okay? Something's bothering you. Nothing. (laughs softly) Is it just me, or does it feel like... a hundred years ago when we first met in Africa? (laughs softly) A hundred and fifty. (distant banging, clattering) What is that? (banging continues; zebras barking) I don't know, but half the animals in that truck would eat the other half if they could. (banging continues; lions growling) Oh, whoa. No, no, no, no. Hey, listen... Hey, you don't want to go near that thing, buddy, okay? That-that thing'll eat you. (hisses) (warthog grunting quietly) (hisses) (camels grunting) What's wrong? You got to see this. All right, look. All right? The warthog should be terrified of that thing. That's a serval. That's a wild African cat. But instead... it's like they're... they're best friends. (camels growling) (growling continues) (animals grunting, yapping, caterwauling) (animals hissing, squealing, growling) Let's get out of here. Come on. (animals grunting, growling) So they were  all  growling at you? Yeah. Every single one of them. Like they'd all found a common enemy. Us. And at first it was just the serval, but then the rest of the animals joined in? Yes. But... not all at once. It was more like it was passing from one animal to the next. And... so... what is it? What's going on? I don't know. Maybe it's some kind of emotional contagion. What's that mean... "emotional contagion"? Mitch : It's a biological phenomenon. Nobody quite understands it, but it's real. Like yawns are contagious. You see somebody yawning, you can't help but yawn yourself. Same thing with laughter. And you think that's what's happening with the animals? I can't say for sure, but it's a theory. But if it's true, that would explain why the abnormal animal behaviors have been increasing so much these past few weeks. Because animals in proximity could be triggering each other. Like inside the truck. You're saying one of the animals starts displaying the behavior, then it spreads from one to the next. Like a spark. Something my father said, I didn't understand at the time, but... he called it "the spark." Okay? He said that once the spark was lit, it would spread all over the world from animal to animal, like wildfire. And that once this happened... ...it would be impossible to put out the flame. (airplane flying overhead) This team's had a few close calls before but nothing like this. We never lost anybody. Maybe it's a sign. There are ways to fight for animal rights that don't involve violence. Maybe you and Ray should refocus your efforts. You think it's just me and Ray? The F.A.R.M. is huge. How do you think we come by this plane? Or that truck? We're just the tip of the spear. Maybe you should join us. We could use someone with your skills. I share your basic beliefs. And I applaud your crusade against those who harm animals. But, no, I could never get on board with your methods. Well, that's a shame. I'm here. And so is the plane. (indistinct announcement over P.A. speaker) Agent Brannigan. I need to ask your guy a few questions. (medical monitors beeping and whirring quietly) Cody Gibson. Well, you're lucky to be alive. Are you a doctor? Nah. Who are you? I'm just a guy interested in this device. It's called an electroporator. I don't know what the hell the thing does, but, uh, it was stolen from the zoo you broke into last night. Oh. I don't know what you're talking about, dude. "Dude"? No, don't "dude" me. (screaming in pain) I hate being "dude-ed." Clearly... these bad folks are sweet on this electroporator thing. So why don't you tell me where it is I can find them. I just can't believe we let it get this far. One minute Jamie's wanted for killing an FBI agent. The next minute, we're in a gunfight. At a zoo. You think I wanted it this way? It was your idea to contact this Ray character. Doesn't take a fortune teller to figure out that... bad things might occur when he's around. Yeah, well, I didn't hear you come up with any ideas about how to get out of this country undetected. Right, but my no ideas beats the hell out of robbing a zoo to get out of here. Jackson : We had no other options, Mitch. None. People got shot, Jackson. By masked gunmen. We were among those masked gunmen. Well, at least you got your electroporator. Ray's still out, huh? Yep. And I say we leave him. We're not leaving the guy, okay? He's hurt. I'm a veterinarian. I didn't take the Hippocratic Oath. Are we really just gonna leave him here? Could put a bow on him. Leave him in front of a police station. We'll call an ambulance once we get to the airplane. Then we'll call the zoo, tell 'em where they can find their animals. And to use extreme caution when approaching them. Hold on, everybody. (cocks gun) Seriously, Ray? What is it with you guys and guns? Well, my charm only gets me so far, pal. Where's Anissa? She's with Abe. They went to the plane. Ray : Good. Let's go get 'em then. It is my plane, after all. Fine. Come on. Ray : No, no, no. No. The plan abides. We're taking the animals. We can't. Sure, we can. No, it's impossible. Something is wrong with them. And we can make it right by setting them free. So get in the truck, and let's go to Africa. Now! (Ray groans) So who's volunteering to ride in the back? Or do you want to draw straws? All five of us can't fit in the front. Look, you're not getting it. The animals, they're not right. It's not safe back there. I'll ride in the back. Jackson, no, you cannot do that. I'll come with you. Well, look at that. How sweet is that, huh? All this "saving the world" stuff is really working out great for you, Jackie Boy! Mitch, you drive. Appreciate you saving my life, sport. You say that now. But I might have left a nickel in your chest. Shouldn't hurt. But getting through airport security might be an adventure. You okay? Yeah. None of this is your fault. That's not exactly true. Hey, I study people for a living, remember? It's my job to analyze a situation and recommend the best course of action, and you are the best course of action. Every step of the way. We've made it this far because of you. This far, huh? Riding in the back of a speeding truck with homicidal animals, headed, by gunpoint, on our way to a rendezvous with a stolen plane? (sighs) We'll make it. We have to. Yeah, we will. Yeah. My instincts are to trust you. I was maybe wrong with Delavane and-and Alves, but... And we were all wrong with Delavane and Alves. Yes. That's true. Listen, I want you to know something. These past few months are obviously some of the worst ever. You know, what we've seen, what we've had to do... it's... But I want you to know that, in spite of all that... I'm so glad to have met you. (chuckles) (zebra yipping) (groaning) (animals clamoring) (hissing) What's happening? It's okay. Just stay-stay back. What is that? (tires screeching) I'm pulling over. Like hell you will. We're almost there. (animals clamoring) (tires screeching) (horn honking) (tires screeching) (animals clamoring) (tires screeching) (camels groaning, sirens approaching) We gotta get to the airport. Mitch, the electroporator. Yeah, I got it! (tires screech) (animals grunting) (airplane taking off in distance) (siren wailing) Jackson : Go! Go! (engines whining, rumbling) Go! Hey! Go! Hold on! (engines whirring at full power) (siren wailing) (siren stops) Let's get out of here! I got this. Chloe : No! Jackson : No! No! Jackson : Chloe! Anissa! Chloe! (sirens wailing) (sirens stop) She's all yours. Yes, sir. This one's all mine.
