 Previously on "Saving Hope"... 
 Maggie, this is Hannah. 
 Hi. 
 Dump her. Marry me. We'll be together 60 years. 
 If you think I am going to let you do whatever the hell you want, then you're crazy. 
 Then I quit. 
 Charlie : I'm upstairs. I'm in a coma. 
 Where we going, Jimmy? 
 Home. 
 Hey, Charlie, why don't you wanna wake up? 
 Daddy, please! Slow down! 
 Alex : Is everything okay? 
 Shahir : Something is happening to the signals in his mid-brain, something I've never seen before. 
 Charlie whispers : Alex. 
 Can you follow my finger? 
 I'd have to give that a 4. 
 Hmm. Definitely a 4. 
 All right, squeeze my hand. 
 Okay, that looks like a 6 to me, for a total G.C.S. of 15. 
 That is a perfect score. 
 Charlie, you're officially out of a coma. 
 Shahir, I've got this. 
 Actually, there are a few more neurological tests... 
 Shahir, she's got this. 
 You two wanna... 
 I should probably change out that bag. 
 ♪ It's the price I paid ♪ 
 Alex. 
 I don't want you to dehydrate. 
 ♪ 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 ♪ A love ♪ 
♪ a love ♪ 
 So what do you think? 
 I look, uh, tough, badass? Murder ball? 
 (Chuckles) I'd cross the street. 
 Listen, are you sure you don't want me to come with you? 
 Yeah. I'm just gonna be learning to walk again. 
 Only slightly emasculating. 
 Hey! 
 I'm... I'm sorry, man. I, um... 
 I'm just so amazed to see you around. some good work around here. 
 Yeah. Uh, trying to. 
 Uh, oh, sorry, man. I don't want to intrude or anything. 
 I'm sure that there's other people that you'd rather... see. 
 I just sort of wanted to wish you good luck with your recovery, and... I mean, you're a lucky guy. 
 Oh, yeah. I know that. 
 Well, uh, cool. I'll, uh, I'll see you around. 
 Yeah, absolutely. Could I talk to you for a second? 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. I'm good. 
 I'll, uh, I'll catch up on my celebrity gossip. 
 I'll be right back. Yeah. 
 (Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) 
 What's up? 
 I'm leaving the hospital. 
 Were you fired? 
 I quit. 
 That's too bad. 
 Yeah, you know, it's just time to move on. 
 I'm actually pretty excited about it. 
 I'm going to follow up with a few of my patients today, and that's it. I'm gone. 
 Well, everything I could have possibly said about this to you, I've already said. 
 So say good-bye. 
 Bye, Joel. 
 Bye, Alex. 
 Charlie, the physiotherapist will help with any muscle weakness, and the occupational therapy will deal with any cognitive deficits. 
 Brain damage. 
 Right. 
 (Clears throat) Shahir, do your patients usually, um... remember being in a coma? 
 Some do. 
 Yeah. See, I had very vivid hallucinations that I was, um... out of my body. 
 Were these hallucinations visual or auditory? 
 Both. I would say both. Definitely both. 
 In a coma, a person basically loses contact with their body sensory input, so they feel sensations as though they're external to their bodies, but they keep the illusion that they have a body. 
 It's very similar to the early stages of sleep. 
 So I was dreaming? 
 Yes, and because you didn't wake up, your dreams became a reality. (Elevator bell dings) 
 It's really quite common. 
 Ha! 
 Do you believe what you experienced was real? 
 No, of course not. 
 Charlie, you're perfectly normal, okay? 
 Okay. Don't sweat it. 
 I'm gonna find you a therapist. 
 Okay. I'll, uh, I'll just wait here. 
 I'm perfectly normal. 
 Still talking to myself... but now everyone can hear me. 
 Hi. 
 How you doing? 
 You put this in yourself? 
 No, a doctor did it for me. 
 Were you in another E.R. before you came here? 
 No, I paid a doctor $1,500 to put a nasogastric tube in for me. 
 We'd do it for free. 
 Just saying. 
 And why did you do this? 
 I'm trying to lose weight. 
 By eating through a tube? 
 Jackie, you're not overweight. 
 For a bride, I am. Ow! That really hurts. 
 I'm trying to lose weight for my wedding. 
 I get 800 calories a day pushed through this tube. 
 And how long have you had it in? 
 10 days. I've lost 12 pounds, so it's a success, but... ow! 
 You're not gonna take it out, are you? 
 Did you get her into an X-ray? 
 Yeah. 
 Check this out. 
 She has free air under her diaphragm. 
 Is that bad? 
 It's kind of an emergency, yeah. 
 He's right. Given the pain you're in and the tenderness in your belly, I think it's possible that the tube has perforated your stomach. 
 Ohh. My fiancé's not gonna believe this. 
 He's just gonna be happy you're alive, trust me. Olivia? 
 He thinks it's ridiculous, but it's important for a woman to look good on her wedding day, right? 
 It is, but... 
 All those pictures. 
 I just wanted him to see me and be proud, you know? 
 Well, it's important that you give him a call, okay? 
 We're gonna get you into surgery right away, and Olivia will prep you. 
 Okay. 
 We should find out who put that tube in. 
 It's unbelievable. 
 Hey. Charlie. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You are such a tiger. 
 Mmm. 
 You're like a dirty nerd. 
 If I'd known you were so dirty, I wouldn't have waited this long. 
 (Chuckles) Maggie. 
 We don't have to be so... full-on. 
 You don't want me to kiss you at work. 
 No, no. I... I want you to kiss me everywhere. 
 I... you don't have to try so hard with me. 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 Um... 
 Okay. 
 I've been on every diet... the watermelon diet, the grapefruit diet, the lemonade diet, seafood diet. 
 You see food, you eat it? 
 Yeah. I'm still on that one. 
 It's easier for men. 
 No, I'm just saying, it's your wedding. You don't want there to be too much... sausage in the casing. 
 (Monitors beep) I'm running the stomach on the greater curve from the pylorus right to the body. 
 Okay, I see the perforation. 
 There's some gastric content. 
 Damn it. There are nodules in the omentum. 
 Oh, no. 
 Okay, we're gonna need to get a quick biopsy and a quick section. Cautery, please. 
 Yeah. 
 To the left. 
 When I push on the antrum, it's rigid. 
 I shouldn't have made fun of her. 
 We don't know what it is. Let's try to stay positive. 
 As soon as I've finished this, let's take the scopes out. 
 We gotta open her up. 
 Damn it. 
 (Grunting) Okay. 
 Okay. Okay. Ow. 
 Cops brought him in. Heroin user. 
 O.D.'d under a bridge. 
 Medics gave him naloxone. 
 He got all jacked up and tried to punch someone in the face. 
 I was confused. 
 How much did you take? 
 (Chuckles) A lot, I guess, 'cause I'm here. 
 He's tachycardic, febrile, and temp's 103. 
 You went through his pockets. 
 Yep. Found a copy of "The Flowers of Evil." 
 Wallet, no cash, no drugs. Name's Wesley Taylor. 
 It's Wes. 
 And hello, you can't strap me down. I didn't do anything. 
 Well, we'd love to let you leave, Wes, but you're sick. 
 I feel okay, honestly. 
 This whole thing is just crossed wires. 
 I just want you to unstrap me. 
 Because you wanna go score, and we can't let you do that right now. 
 Look, I need to go because my friend owes me $50, okay? 
 And I can't call him because I lost my phone. 
 Sir, he's waiting for me. Okay, I can go, right? 
 No. 
 Come on. Let me go. 
 Wes. 
 I gotta go. Let me go. 
 Let me go! 
 Lay back down, Flowers of Evil. You're not going anywhere. 
 (Lowered voice) Hey. Lady doctor. 
 Please help me. 
 His track marks look infected. 
 Yeah. Looks like cellulitis. 
 All right, Olivia, let's get 2 grams of cefazolin. 
 I'm on it. 
 And do you have a skin marker? Great. 
 Okay. And, uh, let's do an aerobic and anaerobic swab and blood culture, make sure there's no strep in there. 
 Wes, we're gonna come back and check on you soon. 
 If you're not calm, these don't come off. 
 Hey. So I hear that Goran is leaving. 
 Uh-huh. 
 You know, I'm getting a divorce. 
 Technically, I'm basically single myself. 
 Yeah. I'm seeing somebody. 
 I... didn't mean it like that. 
 I was just throwing it out there just to see if, you know, anything came back to me. 
 Dude, you are very, very rusty. 
 Okay, the liver looks okay. 
 I see some bile-stained fluid in the peritoneal cavity. 
 I'm feeling the mass in the antrum. That's bad. 
 What the hell is a 38-year-old woman doing with gastric cancer? 
 Okay, the tube must have perforated just proximal to the tumor. Suction? 
 Oh, boy, she's got more nodules in the peritoneum. Metz. 
 (Suction gurgling) 
 (Phone buzzes) 
 I'm gonna take the tumor out. 
 Path results? 
 Yeah, that's why they call it a quick section. 
 Sighs : Hey, Dr. Reid here. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Jackie's cancer has metastasized. 
 What do you wanna do? 
 Well, there's not a lot we can do,  but we can take out the primary tumor. 
 We're gonna do a B2 reconstruction. 
 I will need a G.I.A. 60 with a green firing. 
 She may not have much longer, but... we can try and make her more comfortable. 
 Okay, just wait. 
 Let me get in here. 
 Okay. I got you. You got the bars? 
 Yep. 
 (Strained voice) Okay, let's go up. 
 That's it. Use your upper body strength to support your weight. 
 You steady? 
 Yep. 
 Okay, now I want you to take a small step forward. 
 (Grunts) That's it. 
 Good. Good. 
 Okay. Now let's do another one. 
 No, I got it. 
 I got it. You can let go. 
 No, I'm not gonna let go. Just take... 
 Gino! 
 Let go. 
 Okay. Okay, big guy. Go ahead. 
 Just take it easy, okay? 
 (Exhales deeply) 
 That's it. That's it. 
 (Grunts) 
 (Exhales sharply) 
 (Exhales sharply) 
 That was really good. It was. It was excellent. 
 Sighs : Thank you. 
 Okay, come on, cowboy. 
 Let's get back on the horse, huh? 
 Come on. 
 Just let... let me do it. 
 Okay. Fine. 
 (Grunting) 
 You sure you got this? 
 (Grunting) 
 That's good. You're almost there. 
 You're almost there. 
 (Grunting) 
 There. 
 Yeah, that was great. 
 (Panting) 
 Just... we'll keep doing this till I get it right. 
 Yeah, or we could just do it and leave it at that, okay? 
 Look, man, this is gonna be hard, okay? 
 And you're gonna get frustrated. 
 Sighs : I'm just used to being good at things. 
 Yeah, well, get un-used to that, all right? 
 Get used to being a guy that just woke up from a coma and let me help you, and maybe you can go back to being that other guy. 
 Charlie! 
 Charlie. Charlie. 
 Hey! There you are. 
 We having lunch today like regular people? 
 What? Why weren't you at physio? 
 Uh... I'm on a break. 
 They let us out to eat and drink. 
 What's wrong? 
 I just wish you would have texted me. 
 To tell you that I'm gonna have a bottle of water and read the paper? 
 To let me know where you were. 
 Why? 
 You just got out of a coma. 
 And so what, therefore... 
 So you can't go wandering around. 
 Baby, I'm in the hospital. 
 If I'm gonna wander around anywhere, this is the place to do it. 
 If anything were to happen to me... if something were to happen to you, I would need to be there... me, who was there for the last three months, who watched you code twice, who watched them take you off the ventilator, to watch Shahir put electrodes in your head, Charlie. That was me. 
 I was there, and I need to know where you are. 
 Come with me. 
 Sit. 
 I have been away. 
 Yep, and I've been here. 
 I know. Now what are you angry about? 
 What are you... what are you pissed about? 
 I'm not pissed. I'm... I'm worried. 
 I just want you to be safe. 
 I'm in a wheelchair. It doesn't get much safer than this. 
 How can I help? How can I... how can I reassure you? 
 I don't know. 
 Sighs : There's nothing you can do. 
 Look, I know this is a big adjustment for you. 
 Trust me, I promise you, it is a bigger adjustment for me. 
 You don't know what it was like. 
 Alex... 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 You don't know that. 
 Well, you're right. (Scoffs) 
 But I don't want to. 
 Alex... 
 I am sorry that I left you. 
 (Lowered voice) Come here. 
 I didn't... uh, are you okay? 
 I'm okay. 
 I don't wanna hurt you. 
 You won't hurt me. Come here. 
 I just want you closer. 
 (Sighs) 
 I didn't break. 
 You are such a commitment-phobe. 
 Well, people change jobs all the time. 
 Well, you're gonna be lost without us. 
 You know, it's interesting. 
 You seem genuinely concerned about me. 
 I am genuinely concerned about you as your friend. 
 What are you gonna do with yourself? 
 I don't know. I was thinking about Haiti. 
 Oh, you have no idea, do you? 
 Not really. 
 The infection's spreading, if you take a look at the margins here. 
 I need something for my pain. 
 Hi, Wes. I'm Dr. Goran. 
 (Grunts) Feel that? Take a listen. 
 (Inhales sharply) Ow! It hurts. Please, I'm not making this up. 
 It's a crackly, popping sound. 
 It's crepitus. 
 It's gas under the skin caused by bacteria. 
 Well, let's give him 10 milligrams of morphine. 
 Make it 30. 
 You do a swab? 
 Yeah, results aren't back yet. 
 I'm confident diagnosing him, though. 
 Yeah, I agree with you. 
 Ohh, what is going on? 
 Wes, I think you have necrotizing fasciitis. 
 It's extremely serious. We need to get you into an O.R. 
 And try and stop the infection from spreading. 
 Wait. That... that's flesh-eating disease, right? 
 We need to get him into the O.R. right now. 
 Olivia, 4.5 grams pip-tazo. Call ahead. 
 We got an "A" case here. I need Dr. Ray and a scrub nurse. 
 What are you gonna do to me? 
 He's gonna try to save your life. 
 All right, we're gonna cut the arm, see if the tissue's still good. 
 We're gonna irrigate the wound, try and flush the bacteria out. 
 Wait. You have to cut my arm? 
 If the infection's spreading like I think it has, Wes, you might be facing amputation. 
 The infection moves incredibly fast, Wes. 
 She's right. And once you're under anesthetic, we're not gonna be able to wake you up and ask you any questions. 
 I don't wanna lose my arm. 
 If it comes down to that, it could be your arm or your life. 
 Can we call your family or anything for you? 
 No. 
 Okay, can you prep this for me, Victor? 
 I can prep him, but I'm in another surgery. 
 Lindsay can assist. 
 Okay, get her in here now. 
 Victor : Okay. 
 He's strapped in. You ready for this? 
 Miss you already, Joel. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Happy to hear that Charlie's doing well. 
 Alex? 
 I said I'm happy to hear that Charlie's doing well. 
 Yeah. He's back to his old self. 
 Have you thought about doing therapy as part of his recovery? 
 You wanna shrink Charlie Harris? 
 A lot of patients that come back from a T.B.I. can experience frustration and anger, mood swings. 
 Not that I've seen. 
 He's really fine. Yeah. 
 It's the early days. 
 (Elevator bell dings, doors open) 
 So can I make him an appointment? 
 He's awake. You can ask him yourself. 
 I'm more intimidated by him than I am by you. 
 And you should be, so just why don't you dust off your couch when there's actually a problem? 
 (Knocks) 
 Hey, Dr. Reid. 
 Hi, Jackie. 
 This is my husband-to-be Mark. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Kids, say hi. 
 Jakey and Anna... well, technically Jake is Mark, and Anna's mine. 
 Why don't you tell the nice doctor what you wanna wear to the wedding? 
 A bunny costume. 
 A bunny costume. 
 I think we should just let her have a whole bunny-themed wedding. 
 I think that's an awesome idea. 
 We need some awesome ideas. I try to lose some weight, and I wind up under the knife. 
 Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything, honey, but you're looking kinda fatter. 
 I don't think I can go through with the wedding. 
 He wasn't even mad about the money. 
 What a guy. Did I get lucky or what? 
 How does it look? 
 Just fine. 
 What happened to non-invasive? 
 Is there a problem? 
 Actually, Jackie, we had to remove part of your stomach. 
 Why? 
 Because of the N.G. tube? 
 No. 
 We don't know what the exact cause is, but we're waiting for the test results to be sure. 
 Anyway, you're with your family. 
 I'll come back. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Sens, please. 
 Place your retractors in here. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I am going to zap the tissue and see if the muscle contracts. 
 We're looking for the four c's in here. 
 What are we looking for? 
 Contractility, capacity to bleed, consistency, and color. 
 I'll tell you right now that color is not good. 
 It's not contracting, either. 
 All right, local debridement around the abscess is not gonna work. 
 And what will? 
 We have to keep resecting muscle until we find ourselves a clean margin. Knife, please. 
 Want me to just keep retracting as you go? 
 Yes, please. 
 Sighs : A lot of that tissue looks necrotic. 
 "A lot" is an understatement. 
 Push that right in here. Can you feel that? 
 Oh, yeah. That muscle feels terrible. 
 It's thick. All right. 
 Change of plan. The forearm's not salvageable. 
 The dead muscle keeps feeding the infection. 
 His body's not fighting back. 
 Do you wanna amputate? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Let's go above the elbow. Uh, go get the amputation kit, please. 
 Pressure's dropping. 
 Gonna make a fishmouth incision here. 
 All right, let's move on this one, guys. 
 He's going into septic shock. 
 Thank you. 
 Right, there's the brachial artery right there. 
 Isolate the suture ligator. 
 Kelly? 
 I'll hold that. 
 O vicryl suture. 
 (Monitor beeping steadily) 
 Knife. 
 All right, Maggie, I'm gonna cut down through the muscle, okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Bone saw. All right. 
 Once we separate the arm from the body, we'll have the son of a bitch contained. 
 (Whirs) 
 (Buzzing) 
 Yo, hey, friendly face! 
 Guy who fell, hello. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. Um, I went to get a soda, and now I'm all turned around. 
 Uh, what are you looking for? 
 The rehab. 
 That's on the sixth floor. This is the fifth. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. (Chuckles) 
 So big, uh, lunch plans? 
 Uh, well, just, um, me and a piece of pie and a whole lot of sunshine. 
 You're welcome to join me if you want. 
 Nah, I'm more of a drinking in a hot tub at midnight kind of gal. 
 Oh, party girl, huh? 
 Not any more. 
 It's so perverse going through all of this and realizing that you'll never be the same. 
 Well, that's what the rehab's for. 
 Right. 
 (Clears throat) 
 Hey, uh, why'd the pie go to the dentist? 
 I don't know. Because he needed a filling. 
 Ah ha! 
 (Both laugh) 
 Sure your digestive system can handle that? 
 I just got out of a coma, Dawn. 
 Let me eat my pie. 
 Oh, I'm over the fact that you tried to kill me, in case that's what you're wondering. 
 Alex told you about that. 
 No, she didn't. 
 She's got class, Dawn. 
 Well, so then how'd you hear about the D.N.R.? 
 See, when I was in my coma... (Clears throat) 
 I walked around the hospital in a tuxedo. 
 I was invisible. 
 And I saw everything that happened here, including when you turned off my ventilator. 
 Oh. And I talked to dead people. 
 Charlie, you're just as funny as you were before. 
 I'm hilarious. 
 You know, I once had a patient who described an entire coronary artery bypass graft from above. 
 She said she drifted out of her body, and she didn't float back in until I stitched her up. 
 I talked to ghosts. 
 What's Alex say about it? 
 I believe you. 
 What? 
 I don't know why I believe you, but I do. 
 Who knows, right? 
 Oh. 
 By the way... 
 I'm working here again. 
 Oh, to bury the lead, Dawn. 
 Well, Kinney made me a very generous offer. 
 Can I wheel you somewhere? 
 All right, we've achieved hemostasis. 
 He's not bleeding any more. 
 Don't see any infection. 
 How much blood loss? 
 Very little. 
 You know, we got control of the vascular structures right from the get-go. Why do you ask? 
 He's had a lot of fluid, and I can't keep his pressure up. 
 Start him on vasopressin. 
 Could he still be in septic shock? 
 No, septic shook's in the bag here with the rest of his arm. 
 Oh, why isn't this kid perking up? 
 Are you giving him the stuff? 
 Yeah. His pressure should be up. 
 Damn it. Infection's shifted our margins. (Monitor beeping erratically) 
 Okay, we're gonna keep debriding, then. 
 His pressure's tanking. I need a central line. 
 Open up a central line kit, please. 
 (Erratic beeping continues) 
 All right, that's what's happening with your arm. 
 Knife, please. 
 (Monitor beeps rapidly) 
 Make an incision to expose the tricep here. 
 I need retractors in here, please. 
 Got him on 50 mics per K.G., and he's barely holding on. 
 'Cause the infection's in his blood now. 
 We got our source control. 
 Joel. 
 What is it? 
 Wire's not advancing. 
 You in the vein? 
 Yep. I drew dark blood. I'm in the vein... 
 Can't get it through. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 
 Woman : Hurry it up, Lin. 
 Shut up! 
 Okay, just take it easy a second. 
 Mag, back it up, okay? 
 Show it to me. 
 Now thumb and forefinger. Just bend it ever so slightly. 
 That's it. Swivel the guard wire. 
 Gentle pressure. 
 (Rapid beeps) 
 You good? 
 Okay. Wire's in. 
 Bacteria's doubling every eight minutes. 
 We don't have any time left. 
 This thing is like a forest fire. 
 Heart rate's up to 130. 
 If this infection spreads into his chest, we're not gonna have any tissue to make a margin. 
 And then what? 
 And then nothing. 
 Then he dies. 
 
 
 
 Hi, Alex. 
 Dawn. 
 Last time we were here was under less happy circumstances. 
 So... have you seen Charlie? 
 Yes, I just bumped into him on his lunch break. 
 What, do you got a tracking bracelet on his ankle or something? 
 (Chuckles) No. 
 I guess you heard the news. 
 I have. So why Hope Zion? 
 I mean, there's a thousand hospitals you could have gone to, you know. 
 Well, they needed a head of cardiac surgery, and this feels like home. 
 Alex, I would like to mentor you if you'll let me, as two female surgeons. 
 Charlie's my mentor. 
 Yeah. 
 He's making a phenomenal recovery. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How are you finding him? 
 I'm finding him walking and talking and really freaking alive, Dawn. 
 Medium, to the top, please. 
 My regular. 
 Medium top roast. 
 Don't take this the wrong way, Alex. 
 Charlie keeps secrets, and sometimes he doesn't even realize that he's doing it. 
 Can you do me a favor, Dawn, from one female surgeon to another? 
 Just stay out of my private life. 
 (Cash register beeps) 
 I only meant well. 
 I'm very happy for you both. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 And I'm buying your coffee. Okay. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Hey, Zach, do you have a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. (Sighs) I'm having a hardimime delivering some bad news, and I need your advice. 
 I tell people horrible things all the time. Hit me. 
 Jackie, the woman who came in with the feeding tube... she has a stage 4 adenocarcinoma. 
 That's horrible. 
 Yeah, and I went into the room. 
 I had my speech prepared, and I... I froze. 
 She's got two little kids. 
 I don't know what's wrong with me. 
 I give bad news to nice people all the time. 
 So what's different about her? 
 Sighs : She's so happy. 
 And so were you. I mean, Charlie went into a coma on your wedding day. 
 Her best day is about to become her worst, just like yours, and I could go on. 
 I should know how to separate myself from myself. 
 Well... you just lost your nerve. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, don't you normally talk to Charlie about this kind of stuff? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 We found something when we did your surgery... a gastric cancer. 
 We removed it, but it has metastasized. 
 Jackie, your cancer has metas... 
 No! I don't have cancer. 
 Jackie, Jackie, just... 
 I can't! Your diagnosis is wrong! 
 Go to hell! 
 I hope you get cancer! Shh. 
 (Gasps) I'm sorry. That was the wrong thing to say. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, that is okay. 
 I... I want a second opinion. 
 Absolutely. 
 And... a time. How long? 
 The 5-year survival rate is 2% if you do chemo. 
 We're supposed to go on our honeymoon next summer with the kids. 
 Yeah, we're driving to the desert... Death Valley. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Voice breaking) It's so beautiful there. 
 This is a conservative prognosis, and, Jackie, there are all kinds of variables that we can't know about. 
 I know you need to plan for the future. 
 Oh! God. My future had me in it. 
 (Sniffles) 
 We keep searching for a clean margin. There isn't one. 
 If it reaches the torso, it's over. Nothing you can do. 
 I know, Dana. We just have to keep amputating the bottom. 
 Maggie : Joel? 
 Yeah. 
 Look at this. 
 It's checking. 
 Oh, God. It's spreading to the shoulder. 
 Then you don't have a margin. 
 You know what? We'll make one. 
 What? 
 We'll do scapulo-thoracic disarticulation. 
 What, you wanna cut off his arm and carve out a chunk of his chest as well? 
 I know that it's radical. 
 It's for cancer, not necrotizing fasciitis. 
 Have you ever done one? 
 No. 
 Have you even seen one? 
 No, I haven't, but you know what? 
 By the time we're finished arguing about this, it's gonna be too late. I do not want to give up on a 22-year-old kid who could maybe live if we did this. 
 You know what? Why am I even arguing with you about this? 
 What are you gonna do? You gonna fire me? 
 Hell, no. I'm scrubbing in. 
 Wait. 
 Happy? 
 I do like getting my own way. 
 Let's get reycraft in here. We need those hands. 
 Sighs : Let's roll him. 
 Okay, I'm gonna make the incision longitudinally along the spine of the scapula. 
 Kinney : Soft tissue coverage is better with a "Y" incision. 
 Okay, I'll meet you there. 
 No, I need bigger retractors. 
 Go get her a Jackson. 
 Okay, uh, there's the jugular. Metz, please. 
 There's some bleeding. That's a good sign. 
 Liters are good. 
 Large hemoclip. 
 I'm gonna release pec major and minor. 
 Back into the insertion. 
 Hey, come on, Joel. Gotta give me some room here. 
 Go ahead. This is sensitive stuff. 
 Usually I try to make this pretty. 
 It's meatball surgery. 
 All right, I'm suctioning the brachial plexus. 15 blade. 
 All right. Almost. 
 Bennett retractors. 
 Okay, hold on, guys. 
 We have a perforator. Satinsky. 
 You ready, Kinney? 
 Yep. You do the honors. 
 Here we go. 
 All right, you can take that to pathology. 
 That's, um, that's a big hole. 
 Yeah. 
 You wanna wait 15 minutes, make sure we have a clear margin? 
 No. 
 Bandage him up. Get him off the table. 
 Get him into I.C.U. 
 And then what? 
 Give this guy every single antibiotic known to man. 
 Hope that someone's praying for him. 
 (Sighs) 
 Gino said I'd find you here. He seems good. 
 No, Gino's great. 
 So everything's going well. 
 Yeah. Kinney's got my job. Goran's seeing all my patients. 
 I'm practically Rip Van Orthopod. 
 It's very, very, very... strange. 
 Let's get married. 
 That's out of the blue. 
 Well, we didn't get to, and I still want to. 
 Do you? I mean, we never talked about it at all. 
 Baby, of course I do. I just... I don't... wanna... wheel down the aisle, you know? 
 I wanna be the man I was before for you. 
 Yeah, but I'm not talking about a wedding. 
 I don't care about some stupid party. 
 I don't want to get married. 
 I just want to be married to you,  and maybe it's crazy, but we didn't get to, and what if we don't, and I just... 
 I can't lose you again. 
 Well, what are you doing today? 
 Charlie, I didn't mean today. 
 No, I... I wanna get married, too, so what's your day like? 
 Why wait? 
 Really? 
 Yeah. I can get a justice of the peace for... 7: 00, and we can meet in the hospital garden. 
 Just one small detail. 
 What? 
 I'm not wearing a tux. 
 (Laughs) Deal. 
 Garden at 7: 00. 
 Married by 7: 15. 
 No, we are not inviting anyone, Mel. 
 Why can't you wait and have a real wedding? 
 We'll have a party... in a couple of months. 
 That's not the same. The deal with a wedding is that you publicly declare your love. 
 Plus I really want to be in the wedding party. 
 We already tried this. 
 We're just gonna have a small, private moment. 
 Fine. 
 What are you gonna wear? 
 I don't care. Y... you're killing me here. 
 (Monitor beeping steadily) 
 It's so weird. 
 I haven't seen him sleep in years. 
 I'm Wes' father... Peter. 
 I'm Joel Goran... his doctor. 
 So, uh, you, uh... you had to... to take out... 
 I know it doesn't exactly look like a win, but, you know, it was the only thing that we could do to save his life. 
 Your son is recovering very well. 
 He's not my son anymore, really. 
 Well, he's gonna need your help. 
 Oh, I'll give it to him. 
 But, um... my son was... good at math. 
 He, uh... he loved trains. 
 He had a stutter till he was 9. 
 We got a dog, and suddenly he could talk perfectly. 
 I never knew how that worked. 
 I don't know what happened to him. 
 How it all got so bad. 
 Well, you can talk to him about it when he wakes up. 
 (Sighs) 
 Maybe this is what he needs. 
 Rock bottom. 
 Maybe... he'll wake up and... turn it all around. 
 Maybe. 
 (Equipment clattering) 
 (Hums) 
 That looks like a fun game. 
 Shh! 
 You sorting by colors? 
 It's the ace, Charlie. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means you gotta switch and sort by suits now, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Ay... ta-da! 
 Beeps : 65 seconds. 
 Not too shabby. 
 I thought you came out of the coma. 
 Do it again. 
 Yeah. 
 Gino's such a hard-ass. 
 It's just his way of finding out whether I have hidden brain damage. 
 I'm Charlie, by the way. 
 Pamela. Do you? 
 What? 
 Have brain damage? 
 No. 
 'Cause I think I do. (Chuckles) 
 I have no idea what you're doing there. 
 I don't think I'm dealing that well. 
 What's wrong with your leg? 
 I don't know. What are you, a doctor? 
 As a matter of fact, I am. 
 Maybe you could take a look at it later. 
 Maybe I could. 
 (Slapping cards on table) 
 (Monitor beeping steadily) 
 It's good. 
 (Inhales and sighs) 
 I mean, is it all like this? 
 You never read Baudelaire? 
 (Clicks tongue) Um, no. 
 I was kind of busy doing other things. 
 Like what? 
 Like medicine. 
 "My soul is cracked." 
 Is that the way you feel? 
 If you're being simpleminded, sure. 
 He found beauty in ugliness. 
 He was fighting for his individuality. 
 He wanted to be a man on his own terms, against society or whatever. 
 I get bored. 
 So I try to make things interesting. 
 You might want to rethink that philosophy. 
 Yeah. 
 Hi. How's he doing? 
 He's doing okay. 
 (Pen clicks) 
 Dr. Reid, I don't want treatment. 
 You don't have to make that decision now. 
 (Scoffs) Here. Have a seat. (Pats bed) 
 Here's my plan. 
 I want to spend time with my family before... 
 I go. 
 Treatment doesn't preclude that. 
 Uhh. My cousin had chemo, and it didn't make her life any longer, but it sure did seem longer. 
 Still, it could give you more time. 
 Yeah, I don't want that kind of time. 
 I don't want to spend the last six months of my life barfing, with sores inside of my throat, barely able to stand up. 
 I'm so happy right now. 
 I just want to take advantage of every single moment that I have left. 
 I do. 
 How do you feel? 
 (Inhales) It's good. 
 Good. Good. A lot of guys get discouraged from the parallel bars or whatever, and then I get 'em out here and they're like astronauts walking on the moon. 
 Okay, now I want you to try to walk the length of the pool. 
 (Inhales) Yeah, I got this. 
 I've heard that before. I'll be here just in case. (Spits) 
 (Exhales) 
 Hey! 
 Look at you, working so hard. 
 Yeah. This pool must be great for your leg. 
 Water's not really my thing. 
 I'm just wandering, you know, between appointments. 
 (Chuckles and sighs) 
 Hey, I'm getting married. 
 Good for you. 
 Who's the lucky girl? 
 She's a... she's a doctor here at the hospital. 
 Come on in here! 
 Don't make me do this all by myself. 
 I can't swim. (Exhales) 
 Hey, Charlie? 
 What? 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Pamela. 
 Charlie, there's nobody here. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Hey, Joel, just the man I wanted to see. 
 Hey, Bryan. 
 Heard what you did for that kid with nec-fasc. 
 Yeah, it worked out. 
 Some last day. 
 You bet. 
 But it doesn't have to be. 
 What do you mean? 
 I have something that I think might change your mind. 
 Okay. You have five minutes? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 (Microwave beeps, door opens and closes) 
 You hurt my feelings earlier. 
 Okay. 
 I didn't mean to. 
 I am full on. That's who I am. 
 Maybe you think I'm some kind of slut or something, and that makes you uncomfortable. 
 No, I don't think that. And I'm not uncomfortable. 
 You dated that Hannah girl, and I wasn't threatened by that... much. 
 This feels real to me. 
 Feels real to me, too. 
 And that's scary. It's huge. 
 So... you wanna take it slow? 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 (Laughs) 
 I don't know. I... I... we either have a curse or a blessing. 
 I have never had such crazy surgeries with another doctor in my life. 
 That's true. So weird, isn't it? 
 It really is. I just... 
 Sighs : You know, I think there's, um... 
 I think there's some chemistry in there, too... professionally, you know. 
 Anyway, I'm gonna miss you, and I'm just wondering if you... 
 Hey, I should talk to, um... 
 Wanted to, you know, maybe go out for a drink or... two. 
 Not 500 like last time. 
 No, Dana, I, um... 
 No easy way to say this. 
 Uh, I just had a conversation with Bryan Travers, and, uh... 
 Yeah? 
 He offered me a job. 
 Oh. Uh... he offered me your job. 
 (Sighs) 
 Of course he did. 
 Yeah, but... 
 (City and Colour's "The Grand Optimist" playing) 
 (Sighs) 
 Jackie... will you promise to share your joy and sorrow with Mark? 
 To cherish and love him as long as you both shall live?

 Pamela... 
 Now it seems like a mistake. 
 I can't help you. 
 Maybe if you just keep talking to me. 
 No. 
 Then what happens now? 
 You disappear.
