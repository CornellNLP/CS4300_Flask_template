 (monitors beeping, air hoses hissing) 
 Okay, people. 
 Mmm. 
 TAVI is a minimally invasive way of replacing a diseased aortic valve. 
 In the old days, we would crack the chest, do open heart surgery. 
 But this takes way less time, and for some high-risk patients, it's the only option. 
 So today we are going to replace our diseased pig's valve with one made of bovine tissue. 
 Okay, we're gonna go in percutaneously through the femoral artery, up through the chest, insert and deploy the valve. 
 And voila, Wilbur has a new lease on life. 
 You've exposed the femoral artery? 
 Lin, what's next? 
 Cannulate the left and right femoral artery with sheaths. 
 How do you deal with a left suicide ventricle? Reid? 
 Suicide ventricle. Um... 
 It is a very rare condition that... 
 You're stalling. 
 Reycraft? 
 Bolus saline and beta blockers. 
 Excellent. In 2010, "the new England journal" published a multicenter trial on TAVI recipients. 
 How many patients were in that study, Reid? 
 I'm sorry, Dr. Bell. 
 Gonna have to get back to you. 
 The answer is 358. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the patients of Hope Zion are in good hands because although Dr. Reid doesn't know the answer, she will get back to us. 
 (laughs) 
 Okay, what do you say we save these pigs' lives, huh? 
 The contraindication of performing this procedure? 
 An A.C.L.-deficient knee. 
 Very good. Dr. Blake, what else? 
 Uh... 
 Dr. Blake, you're going to be in private practice in less than a year, god help us. What else? 
 A varus or valgus deficiency?

 358 patients? Really? 
 I mean, how were you supposed to know that? (machinery beeps) 
 Well, I'm sure Reycraft knew the answer. 
 Yeah, whatever. That guys is so tightly wound he probably reads flash cards in the shower. 
 Well, Dr. Bell is an amazing surgeon. 
 Yeah, but she blows as a person. 
 I just need to get better. 
 (machinery beeping) 
 Catheter in? 
 Catheter's in. 
 Any complications? 
 No. 
 B.P.'s steady. Heart rate normal. 
 Getting ready to deploy the valve. 
 (hissing) 
 (beep) 
 (hissing stops, click) 
 Valve deployed. 
 (rapid beeping) 
 Pig is tanking, Reid. What are you gonna do? 
 Uh, do an angio. 
 Uh, make sure I haven't blocked the coronaries. 
 (stammers) You've got tombstones on your E.K.G., so you might want to keep your pig alive while you do your sleuthing. (sighs) 
 (monitor flatlining) 
 Dr. Reid, your pig is in V-fib. 
 (clatters) 
 (Alex) Okay. 
 (panting) 
 (beeping) 
 (continues panting) 
 (buzzing) 
 (monitor flatlining) 
 I think I killed my pig. 
 You deployed your valve too high. 
 You gave your pig a heart attack. 
 (beeping stops) Now if this were a real patient, Dr. Reid would be spending the next three years in legal depositions. 
 Sloppy work, but thank you for giving us all a teachable moment. 
 (beep) 
 I have two pigs? 
 Woman : No. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (Alex sighs) 
 Charlie. 
 Dawn. 
 You got my message? 
 Yes. 
 How are you? Wow, you look great. 
 Uh, thank you. I-I feel good, Dawn. 
 How's, uh, Hope Zion treating you? 
 It's good. 
 I mean, they still haven't got my parking spot, but, um, it's familiar. 
 Feels like home. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How'd it, uh, go? 
 I killed my pig. 
 Ooh. Call the hambulance. (chuckles) 
 Dawn, what, uh, what did you page me about? 
 Well, um, you're gonna think this is ridiculous, because it is. 
 But I finally sold the condo, and one of the movers found this behind one of the cabinets. 
 Peggy's cove. 
 That was an amazing thing that you did that weekend. 
 This, uh, dog was drowning, and I rescued it. 
 Anybody would have done that, Dawn. 
 It's no big deal. 
 He's being humble. 
 I'm sure he is. 
 You should get him to tell you the story sometime. 
 I just thought maybe you would want to have it, for memory's sake. 
 Joel. 
 Hey. 
 Uh, how's that O.R. schedule coming? 
 Uh, the same. 
 Yeah, it's amazing we ever got on without him. 
 Nice lobster. 
 (inhales) 
 Awkward. 
 (velcro rips) 8 1/2. Ohio state. 
 Okay. 
 Oy. Uh, 48, uh... 
 Sam? 
 Uh... Over. Nickel. (whispers) Okay. 
 (normal voice) Done. Done. 
 (beep) Done. Don't look at me in that tone of voice. 
 Turn off the phone, Sam. 
 (click) What's the problem, Sam? 
 Uh, they were giving me this, you know... the thing. 
 The C.T. 
 I got a terrible pain. 
 (clicks pen) Show me where it hurts. 
 (inhales) I thought you'd never ask. 
 It's all yours. 
 Oh. (laughs) You rascal. 
 (groans) If I'd known I'd live this long... 
 (groans) I would have taken better care of myself. 
 You're only 55. 
 Are you kidding? 
 That's 112 in hustler years. 
 (cell phone ringtone plays "call to the post") 
 Oh, sorry. I thought I turned that off. 
 Dr. Lin. 
 I thought I turned it off. 
 Phone. 
 (groans) No... 
 Ahh! There goes my livelihood. 
 She's usually a lot nicer than this. 
 What happened, you kill someone this morning? 
 No way. 
 What are the odds? 
 (gloves snap) 
 He has some lower abdominal pain. 
 Let me guess. That's not good. 
 It's nothing conclusive. 
 Give you even money it's cancer. 
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to wager on a patient's pathology. 
 Dr. Reid? 
 Smart. 
 Save your money. My lifestyle. 
 The question isn't "why me?" but "why not me"? 
 (all laugh) 
 (monitor beeping rapidly) 
 (groaning and coughing) 
 Sam? 
 Lie back, Mr. Roth. 
 Jeez. I can't breathe! 
 I think he's having a heart attack. 
 (groans) 
 Emma Nolan. I treated her two months ago for a clavicle contusion suffered on a school trip, but it hasn't really resolved. 
 C.T.? 
 Uh, yeah. As you can see, it shows no fracture in the neck or spine, but there's some inflammation. 
 Yeah, there's a bright spot above the left clavicle. 
 Yeah, sarcoma? 
 Too early to tell. We need to get a sample. 
 That's what I was thinking, so I set up a biopsy tray. 
 Got it all ready for you. 
 Hi. Dr. Goran. 
 Emma. 
 Hi, doctor. 
 What's wrong with her? 
 And these are my parents. 
 Based on Emma's imaging, we're not exactly sure what it is yet. 
 (woman whispers) Oh, god. 
 Okay. 
 Emma, I'm gonna need to biopsy this growth. 
 Does that hurt? 
 It shouldn't be too bad. Why don't you like back and, uh, make yourself comfortable, okay? 
 Okay. Your mom can help you. 
 Uh, can I keep my socks on? 
 I'm freezing, plus I have the world's ugliest feet. 
 (chuckles) Of course you can. 
 (children speaking indistinctly in distance) 
 My friends are never going to believe... 
 (woman sighs) how cute you are. 
 Emma. 
 Too late. Already up on facebook. (laughs) 
 Sorry. 
 No, actually, that's, uh, that's really rather flattering. 
 Oh, god. 
 It's okay. It's okay, mom. 
 It's gonna be okay. (sniffles) 
 All right, Emma. 
 This is gonna pinch just a little bit. 
 Okay. 
 (gasping) 
 Charlie's freakin' angels. 
 (beep) Mr. Roth, please. 
 I'm trying to get a proper read here. 
 How come all the doctors I know are old, bald jewish guys? 
 Please stop talking. (beeping) 
 (whispers) Anyone up for a menage a quatre? 
 (laughs) Sam. 
 There's no question he has aortic stenosis. 
 Along with the mass on his colon. 
 The daily double. 
 Mr. Roth, I'm going to need to schedule you in for a transcatheter valve implantation. 
 Now I'm gonna let Dr. Reid fill you in, because she actually attempted her first TAVI procedure this morning. 
 Dr. Bell? 
 There still is the colon issue. 
 It'll wait. I'm not sure that it will. 
 He has marked S.T. elevation and frequent P.V.C. 
 It can wait. 
 That's not necessarily true, because I feel that if his tumor... 
 Could we take this outside? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Just a minute, Sam. 
 No, no. 
 No, no. Don't go. 
 Beautiful women arguing over my colon. 
 It'll never happen again. 
 Will you book Mr. Roth in for a TAVI, please? 
 Right away. 
 What's going on? 
 Don't challenge me in front of my patient, please. 
 He's my patient, too, Dawn. 
 Brush up on your anatomy, Alex. Heart trumps colon. 
 It's the reason I'm paid more money than you. 
 And if the tumor is malignant? 
 Then it will still be malignant six weeks from now, when we can safely remove it. 
 But I-I think... 
 You give me a sound medical argument in ten seconds or less to do the colon first, or we are done here. Go. 
 (scoffs) 
 Oh. We're actually doing this. 
 Uh, the colon. Okay, this tumor... if it's cancerous, and we haven't properly... 
 Time's up. (clears throat) Thank you. 
 What just happened? 
 (gasps) Dawn just got herself a new patient. 
 Oh. 
 These are your husband's scan results. 
 He has what's called a vertebral aneurysm. 
 Basically, an artery in your husband's neck that supplies his brain has a blockage. 
 And that's why he's not waking up? 
 Yes. 
 Well, can you operate? 
 I'm not afraid not. With the, um, location of this particular blockage, it would be too dangerous. 
 (monitor beeping) 
 Oh, my god. 
 In the meantime, I'd like to repair his cervical fracture. 
 (exhales) 
 What's the point? 
 It's an unstable fracture. 
 Uh, really, the halo is just a temporary measure. 
 God. 
 Last night we were fi... we were fighting again. 
 And then I said some awful things to him. 
 Mrs. Adams...

 I said that if he-he doesn't make it on Broadway by now, then odds are he never will.

 (shudders) It's not your fault. You shouldn't blame yourself.

 (exhales) 
 Um... his mother... (breathes sharply) was in palliative care. 
 A.L.S. 
 We had this conversation... a hundred times. 
 He told me that he wouldn't want to live like this. 
 Um... 
 You should try and get some rest. 
 Uh, I can come back and check on you in just a little bit. 
 Fine. 
 Thank you. 
 (clears throat) 
 Okay. You need to tell me what you want.

 Alex. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 (hums softly) 
 I need to ask you a question. Um... 
 Okay. 
 Did you ever doubt I'd come back? 
 Got anything smaller on your mind? 
 Well... just tell me. 
 Did you, um... did you doubt it? 
 I mean, I had my moments, for sure, but... 
 I always knew you'd come back. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. It sounds crazy. 
 Oh, I'm-I'm doing crazy now, so try me. (laughs) 
 I could still feel you here. 
 You know, it was like you were telling me to keep fighting. 
 Like I was telling you to keep fighting. 
 Ah, it's crazy, I know. (laughs) 
 Nope. 
 Dr. Murphy. 
 Um... 
 How do you deal with a patient that won't tell you the thing that you need to help them? 
 Well, uh, sounds like every one of my patients. 
 Well, what do you... what do you do? 
 Is this, like, an official consult? 
 No, it's more like an official question. 
 Okay, well, you want to continue to build a rapport with them, make sure that they trust you. 
 Then just don't give up. 
 Stay on 'em. 
 Never know when a breakthrough is gonna happen. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 I'm going to book an O.R. to fuse that wedding singer's fracture. 
 Okay. And you're telling me because? 
 Because I'd like you to stay close to his wife. 
 She's... blaming herself. 
 I actually just got off the phone with her. 
 She wants me to come back in to talk about her options. 
 Her options for what? 
 For end of life preparation. 
 W-we can't do that. We don't know what he wants yet. 
 They have had the conversation. 
 Uh... 
 People can change their minds, Gavin. 
 I know this must hit close to home for you. 
 This is not about me. 
 It's very common after suffering a trauma to associate people... 
 Don't shrink me, son, okay? That will not end well. 
 Okay? Any decisions get made, I want to be consulted first, okay? 
 All due respect, Dr. Harris, but you're an orthopedic surgeon. 
 All due respect, I have seen things that you cannot imagine. 
 (clears throat) Listen, I'm asking you as a colleague to, um, keep me in the loop. 
 Okay. 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 (alert signal beeps) 
 (man on P.A.) Code blue... (continues indistinctly) 
 What does that mean, the biopsy results are inconclusive? 
 The sample size is insufficient, so I need to do an open procedure to get myself a larger piece of that tumor. 
 More tests? 
 Yes. 
 I don't believe this. 
 Where is that done? 
 It's done in the operating room. 
 So, yes, your daughter will be under general anesthetic. 
 (voice breaks) Can, I, uh, can I be with her? 
 No, I'm afraid that's not possible. 
 You have to figure out what this is. 
 I'm trying, sir. I really am. 
 Mom... (exhales) 
 What is it? 
 Emma? 
 What is that? Your left arm. (sniffles) 
 Lift it up for me. 
 Lift it up higher for me, please. 
 (shudders) That's as high as it can go. 
 You're in pain. 
 It kills. 
 It started right after you did that needle thing. 
 Let me just look under here. 
 There's a second mass. 
 A-a-another one? 
 Yeah. Ohh. 
 It wasn't there when I did the biopsy before. 
 It's-it's new. 
 (sighs) Gross. 
 You mean I'm, like, sprouting lumps? 
 Could the biopsy have caused it? 
 I don't know. I mean, it... 
 Look, it does... present adjacent to the site. It's... 
 So what you're saying is you made it worse? 
 (woman speaking indistinctly on P.A.) 
 Sam, what are you doing? 
 It hurts too much. I can't just lie there. 
 It just feels much better when I move around. 
 Mm... 
 Well, you... you have to stay still. 
 I can't. (groans) 
 Okay, can you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10? 
 9, approaching, uh... (groans) 
 Samba! 
 Okay, well, Dr. Bell is your surgeon, and I'm gonna give her a call, okay? 
 Yeah, but she scares the hell out of me. 
 Yeah, tell me about it. 
 Dance with me, Reid. 
 Whoa! I-I don't dance. 
 Is that a religious or a rhythmic thing? (groans) 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop! (groans) 
 Your belly is more distended. 
 I need to take you back to imaging. 
 (groans) Yeah. 
 (groaning) Ooh... 
 Dr. Lin. 
 Ooh! 
 I'm taking Mr. Roth in for an emergency C.T. 
 Then we're going dancing. 
 (sighs) His pain is worsening, and I'm worried about it. 
 About an obstruction? 
 But shouldn't you check with Dr. Bell first? (sighs) 
 (groans) I should, yes, but given the day we've had... check that, the year we've had... 
 Maybe you should make the call. 
 Of course. 
 In, say, five minutes. 
 Sorry? 
 Just give me a bit of a head start. 
 Got it. 
 Thank you. 
 (groaning) 
 If we're not back in 20 minutes, call the cops. (laughs) 
 I'm his surgeon, and she doesn't feel the need to consult me? 
 That's not true. Dr. Lin called. 
 When the patient is halfway through the machine. 
 Yeah, I made a judgment call. 
 That's not your job. 
 My patient... 
 My patient. He's my patient. has a complete malignant large bowel obstruction. 
 Okay? The resection needs to be done now. 
 He's not gonna survive a major colonic resection. 
 His heart is too weak. 
 The preload alone will make him code on the table. 
 And when his cecum explodes, what happens to his preload then? 
 Do you ladies even need me for this? 
 Uh, well, yes, Joel, because you're the chief, and we need a medical opinion. 
 My medical opinion is... (clears throat) 
 I think you should tag team. 
 By that, I mean you should do both your surgeries at the same time. 
 I'm not sharing the O.R. with her. 
 Fine. You just asked me my opinion. 
 I gave it to you. If you'll excuse me, I have a budget to revise here, I have a breast cancer walk I need to stretch for... (phone rings) and my phone will not stop... 
 Ringing. Yeah. 
 Yes? 
 No, Irene, I'm not mad at you. I just... 
 Yes, I will be right down. (disconnects call) 
 My patient needs me in the O.R. 
 You're both... competent, so figure it out, okay? 
 Dawn, this is about what's best for the patient. 
 You think I don't know that? 
 Won't you consider that the colon might take precedent? 
 No. 
 Why? 
 Because if I were to concede that and allow you to operate on his belly, and something happened to his heart, I don't trust that you would know how to handle it. 
 I know you think I'm mean. I'm not. I'm frank. 
 So this is about me? 
 As a doctor? Yes. 
 It's not personal. 
 Well, it feels like it is. 
 Well, maybe you need to stop feeling so much and start acting like a surgeon. 
 (country music playing) 
 I can't stand country music. 
 (laughs) Talk to your surgeon. His O.R. his playlist. 
 What are you talking about? This is an amazing song. (clears throat) 
 Sure. If you're a depressive hillbilly. 
 (laughing) What? 
 I like this girl. 
 (exhales) Seriously. 
 In two minutes, this guy got drunk... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Cheating on his wife, quit his job. 
 He just keeps making things worse. 
 (chuckles) 
 George... 
 Wait. One-one second, Dr. Goran. 
 (beep) If anything happens to me, you've met my parents. 
 They can handle it. 
 The larger sample should give us the information we need. 
 (sighs) Come on. 
 (beep)

 Sam, we're gonna go ahead with the heart procedure first. 
 Mm, came up on the wrong end of the stick, huh? 
 Dr. Bell and I decided that this was the best course of action. 
 You almost said that with a straight face. 
 This isn't about me. 
 This is about you getting better. 
 (sighs) 
 What is that? 
 Oh, it's a little pastrami. I'm starving. 
 You can't eat before a surgery. (mutters) 
 Hand it over! 
 Unbelievable. 
 Dr. Bell is gonna be in here shortly. 
 She gets under your skin. 
 You get around her, you lose the ability to think clearly. 
 I had someone like that in my life once. 
 What'd you do about it? 
 I married her. 
 (laughs) 
 (laughs) 
 She died three years ago. 
 Ovarian cancer. 
 Is that when you stopped taking care of yourself? 
 (inhales sharply) 
 You know, I-I got this, uh, great widow with a... a place in Boca. 
 She keeps begging me to come down. 
 Maybe it's time. 
 If the opportunity presents. 
 You gotta jump on it. 
 "You gotta jump on it." (chuckles) 
 'Cause you never know how long you got before your ass is flapping in the blue gown. 
 (laughs) Carpe diem! Seize the widow! 
 (breathes sharply) 
 (deep voice) Seize the widow! (laughs) 
 (laughs) 
 Emma gasping : Jackson. 
 I got it. 
 Very poor air entry. 
 We were talking about her grad dress. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 She just started gasping. 
 What is happening to her? 
 (gasping) I feel like somebody's choking me. 
 I-I c... I can't breathe! 
 Okay, sweetheart. 
 She's got a hematoma at the incision site. 
 It's pressing on the airway, Jackson. 
 I'm gonna have to ask you to step outside, please. 
 Outside, please. 
 Mom! 
 Please! Mommy! 
 (shouting indistinctly) No, no, no, no. 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me. Look at me. Listen to me. 
 (gasping) I need you to lie back for me. Like back. That's it. 
 Crash cart, please. Jackson, move it. 
 All right. Can you clear her airway? 
 Grab the pillow for me. (gasping continues) 
 Got it. 
 Okay, I'm starting her on 13 milligrams of etomidate. 
 Uh, 64 milligrams of succinylcholine. 
 Laryngoscope. (beep) 
 Thank you. (clicks) 
 (velcro rips) 
 (beeping) 
 Uh, E.T. tube. 
 No, I still can't visualize. 
 All right, we've got one more shot. 
 Let's see. Give me the bougie. 
 (beeping) 
 I've got absolutely no idea what's wrong with this girl. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 So... Emma developed another complication. 
 Ohh! 
 It was swelling from the neck surgery. 
 This has to stop! 
 But she is stable now, so it's... 
 I want to see her. 
 No, as soon as she wakes up... 
 (sighs) you can. 
 I want another doctor. 
 Sir, I understand your frustration with me right now, but I'm doing everything I possibly can, okay? 
 To what? Kill her? 
 Philip. (sighs) 
 Philip, why don't you go and, uh, get us coffee? 
 No. No way. 
 No, really, please. 
 I could really use a coffee. 
 I'm not leaving. 
 (whispers) Please, baby. 
 (sniffles) 
 Okay? 
 (exhales) Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I should apologize. 
 No, there's no need. 
 He's not usually like this. 
 It's okay. 
 Um... 
 I, uh, miscarried... 
 Uh, fi-five times, and, uh, we tried for nine years and spent our whole life savings and, uh... 
 (voice breaks) then we had Emma. 
 She's everything to him. 
 So it could be heterotopic. Myositis. 
 I mean, you can't rule out sarcoma, but nothing's inclusive. 
 Does he rule anything out? 
 Uh, typhoid, apparently. 
 Uh, peppermint tea, please. 
 I'm off caffeine. Doctor's orders. 
 So what do you think? 
 (clears throat) I'm... I'm sorry, doctor. 
 Are-are you asking for my help? 
 Regretfully, yes, I am. 
 Look, this girl's condition's only getting worse. 
 Okay? 
 Come on. Walk with me. 
 (sighs and clears throat) 
 So what do you make of it? 
 The new pathologist likes to cover his ass. 
 Yeah. (sighs) 
 (chuckles) Yep. 
 You can frame that. That's useless. (sighs) 
 You know, I don't know about you, Joel, but I didn't get into the... the bone business for these medical mysteries. 
 I hear you. 
 We're supposed to use real cool tools and fix broken things. That's it. End of discussion. 
 So what's the next move? (sighs) 
 Take her to the tumor board. 
 No, there's not enough time for that. 
 I mean, I do think I'm dealing with some kind of aggressive sarcoma here, you know? 
 Well, then use those real cool tools and cut it out. 
 This thing's kicking my ass. 
 Oh, yeah, tell me about it. 
 I've got a wedding singer with an inoperable aneurysm. 
 Talking about pulling the plug on him. (clicks tongue) 
 Sounds like someone I know. 
 Except I had to come back. 
 Someone was chasing after my girl. 
 What did you just say? 
 I thought it was pretty clear. 
 Okay.

 Mrs. Adams. 
 (clears throat) I'd like to talk to you, if I could. 
 Dr. Murphy told me about you. 
 Oh, he did, did he? What, uh... 
 (wheels rolling) 
 What did he have to say? 
 (exhales) Uh, that you were in an accident. 
 In a coma, like Oliver, and... that you came out of it. 
 Well, every case is different. 
 Yeah, he said that, too. 
 Said he didn't want to give me any false hope. 
 Well, I don't want to give you any false hope, either, but I also don't want you to rush into any decisions. 
 See, my fiancee... she held out longer than anybody thought she could or... thought she should. 
 I guess what I'm trying to say is that... 
 No matter which way this goes, you have time. 
 You know... time to just be here for him, or... maybe watch over him for a bit. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. (exhales) 
 I just love him so much. 
 (crying) 
 I'd do anything to get him back. 
 I know. I know. 
 (exhales) 
 (man speaking indistinctly on P.A.) [/i] 
 Dr. Bell. 
 Alex. You lost? 
 Mr. Roth's valve replacement. 
 I'd like permission to assist. 
 A few minutes ago, you were trying to show me up in Joel's office. 
 I wasn't trying to show you up, Dawn. 
 Why the 180? 
 Because you're doing the exact same operation that I struggled with this morning. 
 Mm, I think that pig's family would call it a little more than struggling. 
 I want to learn. I want to watch it done right. 
 There are other cardiac surgeons. 
 None as good as you. 
 Dawn, you said that this wasn't personal. 
 It isn't. 
 Good. Then whatever you think of me... 
 Or you think of me. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 The only thing that matters is me learning to deploy an aortic valve at the proper height. 
 The only thing that matters is me getting better at my job. 
 Congratulations, Dr. Reid, on your first compelling argument of the day. 
 (presses button) Scrub up. 
 (exhales) 
 (exhales) 
 (exhales) 
 You changed your playlist. 
 Let's finish draping and get on this. 
 Such a sweet girl. She made me promise not to look at her feet. 
 She hates her toes.

 (monitor beeping steadily, suction gurgling) 
 (monitor beeping rapidly) Oh, no. 
 Damn it! I must've hit the vert. 
 Suction. Patties and gel foam. 
 Come on, guys. He could be stroking. 
 Foam. 
 Hang on. I think I got it. 
 B.P. rising. 
 Okay, we're back in business. Um... 
 Dr. Harris? 
 Crossbars, please. What? 
 The neuromonitor. Look. 
 That's new brain activity. 
 How is that happening? 
 I don't know. The, um... misplaced screw must have somehow released the aneurysm. 
 So blood flow's reaching his brain? 
 (machinery beeps) 
 I guess so. 
 So is there anything that you haven't told me about these bumps? 
 This isn't the first time you've experienced this kind of thing, is it? 
 Oh, no, you can't tell them. 
 They'll be so upset that I didn't tell them. 
 When was the first time? 
 (sighs) 
 I was 8. 
 Fell off my bike. 
 My parents saw the bruise... a big lump. 
 Then it went away. 
 But the pain didn't go away. 
 No, not for... not for a really long time. 
 Right, okay. Have you had any flare-ups since? 
 A few. 
 Usually happens after I fall or bumping into something. 
 Emma, I think I know what you have. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Dawn : Rapid pacing, please. 
 (click) 
 Valve successfully deployed. 
 No paravalvular leaks. Patient is stable. 
 Heart functioning normally. No wall motion abnormalities. 
 Dr. Reid, how do we know it's time to get out of here? 
 You check the positioning with an angiogram and the function with an echo. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Removing the sheath. 
 And... we're good. 
 And that is how you do a TAVI. 
 (monitor beeps) Put a stitch in it. 
 I might just make my dinner. 
 Dr. Bell? 
 Yep? 
 B.P.'s dropping. 
 What? 
 He's getting tachy. 
 What? That was seamless. 
 B.P.'s crashing. (monitor beeping rapidly) 
 The valve is fine. 
 It's his colon, Dawn. 
 It's ruptured. Let's get the prep. 
 Get that C-arm out of my way! I gotta get in now. 
 I'm gonna need your help with this. 
 Of course. 
 Retractor. 
 Knife. 
 Whoa. There it is. 
 Ohh, whoa! 
 Sponges. 
 Ugh! That reeks! 
 His cecum exploded. 
 His abdominal cavity is filled with fecal matter. 
 Suction. 
 We need to mobilize the bowel. 
 Cautery. 
 (suction gurgling) 
 (whirring) 
 Stapler. 
 You do it. 
 It's been a while since I've been below the belly button. 
 (stapler clicking) 
 So I guess we both were right, huh? 
 (click) 
 (click) 
 (exhales) 
 Can you clamp the mesentery? 
 Clamp. 
 (clicking) Clamped. 
 How we doing? 
 B.P.'s 80 and rising. C.V.P. is 10. 
 Normal sinus rhythm. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Nice work. 
 I'm insanely late for this department head meeting. 
 (clears throat) You'll check in on him? 
 Of course. 
 Listen, Alex, this morning, I was hard on you, 'cause this is a hard job. 
 And if you're gonna feel every... 
 I will, Dawn. 
 Okay? That's just who I am. 
 (man speaking indistinctly) 
 Right. And I'm the bitch. 
 I never said that. 
 You don't need to. I know what people think of me. 
 "Oh, Dr. Bell. She's such a hard-ass." 
 "I'm so afraid of Dr. Bell." 
 I'm not afraid of you, Dawn. 
 You pulled the plug on Charlie, And I'm having a bit of a difficult time dealing with that. 
 Okay? 
 And I'm having a bit of a hard time Getting over Charlie leaving me for you. 
 Okay. (clears throat) You know, we don't... we don't need to do this. 
 (chuckles) 
 Maybe I'm just incapable of being happy, right? 
 (laughs) 
 That's why I kept that stupid lobster. 
 That time at Peggy's cove, my time with Charlie... 
 I think that's the closest I've ever come. 
 Do you still love him? 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 There were some considerable complications during your surgery. 
 You were very lucky. 
 Funny. 
 I don't feel so lucky. 
 We were able to fix your heart valve. 
 But? 
 You have an advanced colon cancer, Sam. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 What are my odds? 
 Survival rates vary. 
 That bad, huh? 
 You should get some rest. 
 Yeah. 
 (whispers) Maybe I should take a trip to Boca. 
 (chuckles) 
 Now that sounds like a plan. 
 And then when you're strong enough, I'll talk about a treatment path. 
 Chemo? 
 (inhales deeply) 
 Mm. (sighs deeply) 
 You know, when Hannah lost all her hair, I went to this, uh, hasidic wig shop. bought her one of each kind. 
 So you could be with a different woman every night? 
 You got my number. (chuckles) 
 I do. 
 You know, uh, I've been thinking about you and Dr. Bell. 
 I'm sure you have. 
 Not like that. 
 Although... 
 (laughs) 
 You know, doc, no one can make you feel like a schmuck without your consent. 
 (pats hand) 
 It's called F.O.P. 
 Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. 
 It's extremely rare. Um... 
 I mean, worldwide, there are maybe... 800 cases. 
 800? 
 Yeah. The body reacts to trauma by ossifying. 
 Essentially, that means that it... grows a second skeleton. 
 That would be why, uh, Emma couldn't raise her arm after the biopsy. 
 You can operate, though? 
 No. I can't. 
 Actually, um, the thing with F.O.P. is that's the worst thing that you could do. 
 As I said before, the body reacts to the trauma by growing more bone. 
 So if I had gone ahead with the surgery, I literally would've taken years off her life. 
 (sighs) 
 This disease is usually discovered earlier in childhood, But, you see, Emma hasn't had that many attacks. And... 
 Well, we... she hasn't told us about any. 
 (sighs) 
 That is because she's been protecting you. 
 Look, it's-it's obvious to me how much you love your daughter. 
 And I-I'm not gonna stand here and tell you how to feel. 
 But children have an unbelievable capacity to just adapt. 
 And sometimes, diseases like this, they... are more difficult for the parents. 
 Okay? 
 She needs you now. 
 Okay. 
 (whispers) I wanna see her. 
 (normal voice) I wanna... I wanna see her. 
 Of course. 
 Come on.

 Well, don't get smug.
