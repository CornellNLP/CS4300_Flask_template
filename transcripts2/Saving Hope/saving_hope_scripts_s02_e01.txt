 Previously on "Saving Hope"... 
 This is already way better than my first wedding. 
 (tires screech) 
 Charlie? I'm not leaving him. 
 Charlie : I am having an out-of-body experience in a tuxedo. 
 You can see me? 
 What's going on? 
 We have to reduce the pressure on his brain, or he's gonna die. 
 Ow! 
 Somebody get me the crash cart! 
 Run that bolus. Get me EPI. 
 Kid, can you see me? 
 I used to be the chief of surgery. 
 Now I'm two guys. One is in a coma. 
 The other is invisible. (monitor beeping erratically) We're losing him. No pulse. You seem to be in a coma. Yeah? That's me. I'm also in a coma. Is that who I think it is? Charlie's ex-wife. Something is happening to the signals In his midbrain... Something I've never seen before. (monitor beeping steadily) I don't want to get married. I just want to  be  married  to  you. I can't lose you again. Well, what are you doing today? Garden at 7: 00. Married by 7: 15. I'm sorry. You're the only one who can see me. Because you're dead. (man speaks indistinctly over P.A.) Do you think we should tell them not to take a cab? Eh, let 'em make their own mistakes. (chuckles) Did I ever tell you, Dr. Harris, That someone once left  me at the altar? That is awful. Yeah? And I hope he spends the rest of his life making it up to you. Me, too. (man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) (gunshot) (woman gasps) (gunshot) (woman screams) (gunshot) (screaming) (gunfire) (gunfire and screaming continue) (gunfire and screaming continue) (gunshots) (screaming continues) (Alex speaking inaudibly) (screaming continues) (speaks inaudibly) (siren wailing) So I'm hearing we have to amortize budget cuts over five years. Do you want bedpans or a surgical robot? I want both. (cell phone buzzes) Let's look again at column "D" on page 47. Hold that thought. (siren wailing) Alex. We got a shooting. At least two other victims, all gunshot wounds. Hey, Zach, we got a 32-year-old male, gunshot wound to the abdomen. G.C.S. 15, heart rate 130. Man : Watch it. Easy. B.P. is 85 over 60. He fell down an escalator. Aah! Can you find my wife, please? C-spine negative, and his leg's a mess. Excuse me? Welcome back. Must've been some vacation. Where is my wife? Alex : Yeah. Get him to trauma! Wait! My wife! I need to know where my wife is! She-she's nine months pregnant. Sir, sir, she was talking to the police. I gotta know where she... She seems fine. Fine? Fine? What does that mean, she's fine? Where is she? You need to lay back, calm down, and let us treat you. I'm not gonna lay back. Nick! Nick! Lucy! Baby is kicking! I'm fine! Ha! Oh! Pork sandwich, baby! Pork sandwich! Pork sandwich! Pork sandwich! (laughs) That's what we say. We say "pork sandwich," you know, 'cause "I love you" is nauseating. For sure, Nick. Here we go, guys. On three. One, two, three. Aah! Yep. Let's get in here. Ow! Woman : Vitals are unstable. 88% on 5 liters. (Nick screaming) Tachy at 120. Get him a liter of saline. And get some O-neg. You're in good hands there, Nick. It's all good. (groaning) Let me at him. Go. He's all yours. Okay, Nick. Okay, Nick. Aah! All right. (groans) Gunshot wound to the left flank. Gonna do a F.A.S.T. Nick, can you wiggle your toes for me? Yeah. Good. You feel that? Yeah. Anything I can do, guys? Yeah, I need traction on this right now. You got it. How was Costa Rica? Nick : Uhh! Hot. Yeah? (ultrasound beeps) No blood around the heart. Chief of surgery? Yeah, man. It's a trip. Ow! It's my stomach! It's my stomach! I know. Nick, we're trying to figure it out here. Ow! (strained voice) Oh, god. Just take it easy, pal. Spleen... F.A.S.T. is positive. We need to get him to the O.R. (machinery beeping) Trauma panel. Cross and type for four units. You guys happy with that leg? Not yet. Get him exposed. Joel : I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it. Where's Lucy? Charlie : I got it. (beeps) Aah! Ow! Alex : Okay. Okay. Aah! Okay, his B.P.'s dropping. Ah, ah. Bad pelvic fracture here. Nick? It's open book. Nick! Belt was acting as a binder. He's tanking. Push warm fluids wide open. You gotta give him everything. Come on, you guys. We gotta get him to the O.R. Okay, give me a couple of minutes. Forget the leg. I'll help you with traction. Okay. (beep) I need the kellys from the chest tube tray now. There's an O.R. free. I'm gonna take him up. Little late to the party, Reycraft. I'm on call. It's my surgery. He's my patient. Okay, Reycraft's got this one, all right? Just do me a favor. Fill out the trauma form or something, please. Joel : Look out! Thank you. (sighs) You know what? You deal with it. I gotta talk to the wife. (indistinct conversations) Oh, my god. What happened?! What happened?! W-where-where-where did they take Nick? He's on his way up to the operating room. Okay. Is he okay? Wh... Your husband's sustained a severe pelvic injury. His femur is broken. He's got some internal bleeding. But we're doing everything that we can. Oh, my god. My water just broke. Yes, it did. Okay, let's, uh, let's sit you down. All right? Okay. Oh. Ex-excuse me, ma'am? Can we use your seat. Thank you. All right. Sit right there. I'll be right back. Okay. Hey, lady having a baby. Page labor and delivery. (labored breathing) Somebody will be here to take care of you, okay? Lucy : Okay. This is the shooter. Kids are out there wreaking havoc. Now I got a million cops in the E.R. I count five. Need a hand? No. He was shot in the head. His brain is pudding. So unless you acquired the hand of god while you were on vacation, I'll just push saline and keep him ventilated. Okay, then. All right. Oh. Did, uh, did you guys get married? Nope. (exhales) I got divorced. It's brutal, acrimonious. It's... I feel like a squeezed lemon, you know? (man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) Hey, welcome back. (chuckles) (continues speaking indistinctly) Dr. Reid? Can I get your help in here? Yeah. It's good to see you. Well, I'm back and I'm bad. What do you need, Maggie? Katie over here... she's groggy, she has stomach pain. But it's hard to tell where or why. She's not exactly communicative. Right. Katie, do you know where you are? Who brought her in? Someone must have dropped her off. Security found her lying outside the E.R. Mm. That's nice. Katie, do you know what day it is? (cries) No. Did you take anything? (inhales deeply) Drugs? Alcohol? I wanna die. You don't know what you're saying. Don't you get it? I wanna die. (sobs) Please, I wanna die. You just need to try to calm down. Please let me die! Please! Listen, you have no idea what you're talking about. Please let... I do. I wanna die! (sobs) Please. Please let me die.  Please. (sobbing) I wanna die! Please let me die! Stop it! (slaps) Alex! (gasps) (continues sobbing) (indistinct conversations) (voice breaks) I... am so sorry. (indistinct conversations continue) Send for a tox screen. And I should... go. (P.A. beeps) man : Dr. Stevens, line 1. Dr. Stevens, line 1. (beep) (woman speaks indistinctly) Hi, there. I'm Dr. Goran. And this must be, uh, Ryan. This is Ryan, and I am Sonja. And I'm his mother, and we were at the shooting. And there was bullets flying everywhere, and some jerk trampled on him. And I have already told two nurses and a police officer and that freakishly handsome tall guy. Okay. I mean, what are you... what are you doing? I am feeling for broken ribs. Ryan, do me a favor. Take a big deep breath. Hold it. Does that hurt? (grunts) Kind of. Okay. He's also... he's just, he's allergic to penicillin and to tomatoes. All right. Take another breath. Do you feel that? Okay. Well, I'm gonna need to get an X-ray to be sure, but I'm pretty certain that you don't have any broken ribs, man. Oh, my god, thank you. Okay. Your son's fine. Thank you, doctor. Dr. Goran, that is great news. Um... Let's get out of here. Okay, you're bleeding. What? You are bleeding. Wow. Let me take a look at that. Oh, my god. Uh, buddy, just hop... hop down a sec. Thank you. It's okay. Just take a seat up there. Yep. Just let me... Oh. Oh, my god. You've been shot. What? You've been shot. Ryan : Mom, are you okay? Yeah. Do... No, mom-mommy's fine. Hey, do you not feel any pain whatsoever here? I'm, uh, no. She's gonna be fine. There's no obvious exit wound here. We have to get you in X-ray right now. Okay, but now? I can't... who's gonna take care of Ryan? Because I can't... I-I can't just leave him here. Do you have someone you could call or... I could call my sister, but she's, like, an hour away... I don't want aunt Becca. She's annoying. I know. Danielle. Do me a favor. Go to the vending machine. Get, like, um, a bag of chips or something... I got it. It's okay. You got it? I don't... No. No, I got it. I'm so sorry. Sonja : I'm here, all right? All right. Spleen is out. (exhales) Bleeding should stop. You want to throw your pins in? Yeah, you need to give me a hand to stabilize the pelvis while I remove the sheet. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Yeah. His lactic acid is still 7. I've given him every O-negative unit we have. He must still be bleeding from somewhere. Maybe retroperitoneal? No bruising on the flank. No, I don't see anything, either. Okay, it's gotta be on your end. Let's get the pins in, and I'll do a pelvic packing. C-arm, please. Charlie? Yeah. You gonna screw in that pin or what? Yeah. (equipment beeps) C-arm out, please. Yeah. I'm checking his labs. Bleeding time's elevated. (whirs) He's not clotting? Could it be a drug reaction? We didn't get much history. What about natural remedies? Homeopathic, things like that? Arnica. I take arnica. Arnica. What about arnica? Arnica, really? That's a little obscure. There's no test for it. Try the tranexamic acid. (equipment beeps) Arm in, please. Sats are coming up. He's stable. Nice call. You still got it. (exhales deeply) Yeah, I still do. (whirs) (indistinct conversations) I heard it went well. (exhales) You don't look like it did. Uh, bit of the yips. First day back and all. (exhales) You okay? I slapped a patient today. And I-I don't know why I did it. You know, she was... she was saying she wanted to die. she was just... she's just a kid, Charlie. I don't... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Sh... You saw a lot of people get shot today, okay? Were you scared? Yeah. I just got my life back. I was... I was scared. Why does this stuff keep happening to us? I don't know. (siren wailing) (knocks on door frame) (wailing continues) I want another C.T., Shahir. Why? Your last one from rehab was clean. Yeah, I know. I'm just, uh... I, uh... want another one. Charlie, you're back at work, you know? I've scanned you up and down, from your medulla to your peduncle. Your brain's fine. Well, what if I told you that being back at Hope Zion was giving me coma flashbacks? Mm. Well, I would say that "coma flashbacks" isn't a neurological term. I'm feeling weird, Shahir. Feeling weird. Okay. What are your symptoms? Uh, I don't know. Just, um... brain-type perceptual things, vivid thoughts and, uh, sounds. I watch death. That's an acronym, right? It's a mnemonic for causes of hallucinations, which is what you just described. Infection, withdrawal, acute metabolic problems, etcetera, etcetera. I'm not hallucinating. Is that a scrip? You want me to see a psychiatrist? Charlie, you were in a coma for three months. Now your brain is fine, but you're acting weird, and... I don't do feelings. (siren wailing) (indistinct conversations) You paged me? Yeah, the patient you... I did the blood panel and the tox screen. And? Um, her I.N.R. is elevated, alt and A.S.T. are in the thousands, and her acetaminophen levels are 500 mics per liter. Painkiller overdose. Yeah, I gave her nac, bolused activated charcoal, and gave her an amp of naloxone. So what exactly do you need my help with? Her liver is swollen. Maggie... where's your patient? She was just here. We need to call a code yellow. Yeah. (P.A. beeps) Man :  Code yellow... He's unresponsive? B.P.'s low. 70 over 46. He lost a lot of blood, right? Yeah. Um, tons. Okay. Hemorrhagic shock. You got a bunch of fluid in the ambulance. 2 more liters in the trauma bay. (monitor beeping rhythmically) We got control of the bleeders and, um... fixed the pelvis in the O.R. Ah, he's so full of saline, he's gonna float away. Yeah? What do you think we should do? Give him ringers instead of saline. He should be waking up. Do it. Yeah? Okay. (chuckles) What? No, I... I just feel like we almost had a conversation. I mean, you asked my opinion. You used to just come in here and bark at me. (indistinct conversations) Hey, Ryan. How you doing? I need you to do a little job for me. Okay. I have to make a speech tonight for a fund-raiser. What's a fund-raiser? Um, a fund-raiser is basically like a boring party for adults. Anyways, it doesn't matter. Um, I need an opening joke for my speech. And I was wondering if you could come up with one for me. I don't know any jokes. Everybody knows jokes. You just gotta think a little. You reckon you can do that? Yeah. Cool. Oh, and, uh, Ryan. I like to work clean. So take it easy on the swearing, okay? (door opens) Joel : What do we got? (monitor beeping rhythmically) Wait. You've X-rayed the wrong leg. I X-rayed the right leg, meaning the left leg. No, you... There's an entrance wound on the left leg, and there's no exit wound... Uh, I'm sorry, what's going on? Sonja, the bullet in your leg appears to have vanished. What, you lost my bullet? Well... Uh... Yes, he lost your bullet. (motor whirring) Do you think you should go home? It's my first day back. It's not going very well. No kidding. Aah. Maybe I had a little, uh, I don't know, P.T.S.D. Or whatever, but I-I saw a bunch of people get shot this morning. It's not an excuse, I just... So... do you think you should go home? I'm fine. Is everything okay with you and Charlie? Maggie. I want to find our patient. I want to get her better. Okay? Okay. You can't have a "little" P.T.S.D. (elevator bells dings) Can we drop this? Found her curled up like a kitten. Thank you. Katie? You guys good? Yeah. We're good. Katie. We need to get you to the E.R., okay? (crying) I'm feeling a lot better. I need to go. I have somewhere I need to be. First we need to try to get you off this bed. Can you stand? (object clatters) I need to get to the park. No, honey. You're sick. You need to be in a hospital. You hate me. No, Katie, I don't hate you. What's at the park? I want to lie down in the grass. I don't want to wake up. I don't want to wake up. Okay. I think I'm gonna puke. Do you see her eyes? Yeah, she's jaundiced. Yeah. Change of plans. I think I'm gonna puke. Let's lay you back down. Katie, we're gonna take you straight to the I.C.U., all right? (continues crying) Mel. Hey, lady. This your O.D.? Uh-huh. I'll get a nurse to do her blood pH asap. Where's that sexy marine biologist you promised me? Couldn't fit him in my carry-on. Her liver's definitely congested, Mel. Katie, I'm gonna need you to scooch over, okay? (inhales sharply) I don't feel good. I know you don't. Katie, we gave you a drug called N-acetylcysteine to counteract your drug overdose. It didn't work. We're gonna do what we can to make you feel comfortable. What's happening to me? We need to consider the next steps from here. (monitor beeping rhythmically) "Next steps"? Uh, there are no next steps. She's in fulminant liver failure. Unless she gets a liver transplant In the next few hours, she'll get her wish. She'll die. Okay. (people speaking indistinctly) Is she a viable candidate for a new liver? Yeah. She's 17 in an I.C.U. in fulminant liver failure. One suicide attempt won't be prejudicial. She say why she did it? No, she didn't really say much. But there's a lot of shame. So if I had to guess, it'd be something situational. Okay. She's not clinically depressed, that's all I'm saying. I think that something happened to her. Thanks. Good luck. Maggie, did you find her parents? You have her phone. (phone buzzing and chirping) What? Sometimes you don't see the obvious. (buzzing and chirping continue) Her mom? I hope not. (people continue speaking indistinctly) Jeez. (indistinct conversations) (exhales and clears throat) (lowered voice) Okay. What is it? I  knew  it. So am I dead? 'Cause I'm-I'm feeling a little ghosty. (normal voice) No. You're in a coma and you're in the I.C.U. Okay, great. Great. So, look, I need your help. I can't... Yeah. Hey. Nick, is it? Yeah. I can't be talking to you right now. Uh-huh. Okay. So my wife is upstairs And she's about to give birth, and, uh... I convinced her to name our son Jedi. "Jedi," you say? Yeah, I know. I know. I thought it would be cool. Talk to her for me. Here's the thing, Nick, um... You're gonna wake up soon, and you can talk to her yourself, okay? All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Don't call here anymore, okay? Okay. "Slut." "Ugly." "Worthless." Texts telling her that she should die. Bully much? No kidding. Kids can be so mean. Yep. They used to call me "psycho Maggie." Really? Why? (Katie) What? Man : I'm just gonna sit down a sec. Whoa. Nelly. What? Come on. Just a little bit. A little bit of what? Take off your pants, just a little bit. (laughs) Just a little bit. Alex : Turn it off. That is so vile. And I hit her. I literally hit her when she was down. What do you wanna do? Put her in the system for a liver transplant and get some genius to wipe her s*x tape off the web. Is this the  milf? Her name is Sonja. What? I'm single. I'm just kind of working on the lingo. What do you got? Okay. Here was the X-ray that we took this morning, and there was an entrance wound right there on the thigh. So where's the bullet? And... In her abdomen? Mm-hmm. It moved? You ever seen anything like it? No. I mean, I've seen a lot of grody, messed-up trauma, but usually a bullet will kind of rattle around in there, and make some wreckage, you know? Exactly. Femoral vein. What? The patient got shot, and the bullet got sucked into the femoral vein. So it's migrating through the venous system? Tumbling through the veins like a pebble in a river. What? Just creating a visual. Well, at least you know where it's going. Joel : Straight to the heart. I owe you one, man. Not keeping score. (monitor beeping rhythmically) (blows whistle) (beeping continues) Dude, I'm not feeling that. Should-should I be feeling that? Hmm. Smelling salts. Sal volatile. It's not insane. Athletes use it. Mm. Is he a boozer? Um... No. No. It could be wernicke's encephalopathy. I mean, we could try vitamin B. I grew up in a small town. I know a lot of alcoholics. No, it's not booze, and it's not delirium. Question... can marijuana put you in a coma? There is some diffuse axonal injury. You know, in a broad sense, prolonged coma is an artificial state created by medical technology. Before life-support systems, a patient like this would not have survived. But he is here. Alive. That is strange. Yes, it is. 
 
 Jackson! Yeah? Push naloxone. Page me if anything changes. There's the old Charlie. That's... my heart. Yeah. Which is actually a pretty safe place for a bullet, if you can believe it. Really? 'cause I don't actually be-believe that. (huffs) You're asymptomatic, which is great. But the problem is, that right ventricle is opening and closing, pumping blood every second. And that bullet is gonna bounce on you, and when it does, it's gonna head right for your pulmonary artery. And then what? Then it'll obstruct the blood flow to your lungs. We have to get in there before that happens. Or what? Or you'll die. You need a sternotomy. Uh, a sternom... I-I mean, I don't... I don't know what that is. It's open-heart surgery. Uh... (exhales) Our, um, our father died from that. Just listen to what she's saying. Your father probably died from complications to open-heart surgery. Uh-huh. And how is that any different? Why are you arguing with the heart surgeon? I'm just trying to understand. She's like this. Makes drama. (scoffs) I have a bullet in my heart, Becca. You don't see me getting shot. Ju... (sighs) Okay. Um, give me a plan "B." Well, option "B" could be that we take a modified angiogram wire, we thread it up through your femoral vein, and then into your heart, and then we would lasso the bullet with the wire. I mean, would that work? Well, the bullet is slippery and moving, so there's no guarantee that we could catch it. So your rodeo fails, and I die? No. Then Dr. Bell would do her sternotomy. Of course. Those are your options. (laughs) Uh... (woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.) (P.A. beeps) Rodeo. Besides, I like you better. (monitor beeping rhythmically) No offense. Dawn : None taken. (people speaking indistinctly) We should cut. It's a sure thing. Dr. Bell, um, it's kind of my bullet in there. I think we should do the wire. It's ridiculous. Hey. Hey. I'm-I'm also chief, so... Hmm. You know? If it doesn't work, we-we crack her open, right? (monitor beeping erratically) Talk to me, Mel. Her creatinine level is 400. That means her kidneys are shutting down. I'll put her on dialysis. Her sats are dropping. There's a liver in Vancouver. That's five hours away. (coughs) Uh-oh. Dr. Reid. Yeah. She's got internal bleeding. We're gonna need to intubate. You know what? I need a... a blakemore tube. I have one. Seriously? Yeah, I've been dying to use it since med school. Uh, nurses' station, under the desk. (people continue speaking indistinctly) Come on. Where are you? Got it! We can buy her some time. After this, we're out of moves. There's always another move. We just haven't thought of it yet. Okay. I'm going in. I love a Hail Mary. Love it. Okay? Hey. I need a liver. Who's dead? Well, he's the closest, unless the cops shot him again. (indistinct conversations) You cuff him even though he's brain-dead? Can't be too careful. Anyway, we're waiting for his parents to come down and okay us to pull the plug on him. Is he an organ donor? No. He shot four people. He's a scumbag. Did you look in his wallet? Of course I did. You're skipping protocol. Protocol is gonna kill my patient, Zach. The nearest liver for her is in Vancouver. It's too far away. Cross type him for me, please? You'll need the family's permission. Well, then, page me when they come. Just don't get your hopes up. Thank you. (indistinct conversations continue) (monitor beeping rhythmically) (machine beeps) (clears throat) Doctor? I can't die. Sonja, I'm so sorry. I cannot hold your hand. Oh, right. Of course. Of course. That's stupid. I'll re-scrub. Thank you. You're in the right place here, you know that? We're doing everything we can. Oh, no, I know that. And it's not... it's not me that I'm worried about. It's just that, um... I mean, I'm all that he has in the world, right? And if I die... he's screwed, Dr. Goran. Oh, I'm sure he's not. No, he is. I mean, he's just... He's the sweetest kid, you know? Mm-hmm. And my sister, she'll take care of him, but... (voice breaking) she doesn't love him. And, um, his dad, I mean... He's not the right guy, right? So... (exhales) (laughs) (sniffles) I don't usually hold hands on the first date. (laughs) Yeah, me neither. Yeah, I usually just go right to the lying down part. But, uh, you're sober and you have job, so I know we're not involved. Okay. Well, I better go scrub. It's gonna be okay. You better make it okay. (indistinct conversations) (cash register beeps) Alex : Large dark. You paged me? Yes. Am I in trouble? I need your advice. Actually, not really your advice, but, uh... Okay. (indistinct conversations continue) I wasn't totally honest before. Yeah. Alex, I have no idea what you're talking about. I feel really sick about hitting that girl, Maggie. Okay. Okay... Everybody thinks that I'm this saint, you know, with what happened to Charlie. That I was, you know, sitting by his bed and... willing him out of the coma or whatever. But... (man) Code blue, six west. (speaking indistinctly) There's just a couple of moments... I get it. One small moment. And I was exhausted, and he kept getting worse, and I just thought maybe, you know, it would be better if he just... Went to the park and laid down in the grass? Yes. Anyway, so when the girl said, you know, "I want to die," I just kind of short-circuited and... Yeah. Look, I... I've never been through anything really massive like that, but maybe it takes a while for you to feel normal. Just give yourself a little time. Charlie : Alex. Hey. Hi. Mm. What was that for? Because I can. Um, there's something I should probably talk to you about. Okay. After work? Sounds good. See you. Hey. Hey, man, ho-hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Can you... wait a minute. You-you said I would get better. (exhales) We're doing our best. (chuckles) So, I'm... I'm, uh... I'm not coming out of this, am I? I'm not gonna make it. And I'm... I'm never gonna... I'm never gonna meet my son? (exhales) We don't know that, Nick. Comas are... mysterious. Yeah. Well, I got a... Pretty deep, bad feeling about this. Did you talk to my wife yet? Oh, come on, Nick. I don't even know if you're real. You could be a... a hallucination, or a-a figment of my subconscious. I'm here, okay? If-if you were making me up, I-I would have combed my hair. Look, just... just tell my wife "Jedi" is not the name, okay? That's-that's it. Right. So I should be willing to seem totally crazy because you regret your baby name? Yes! Yes! You know that obit test? You know, did I live my life the way I wanted to? Well, I didn't always, okay? And I don't want this  to be my legacy. It's a little weird, Nick. Just don't let her name my boy that stupid name. You're the only one that can help me. Please. Please. Please. I can't. Why not? You have a...  you have a gift. Because if I do this, if I... If I do this for you... That's my life from now on. I'm talking to... spirits. Ghosts. Whatever you are. And it's real. So what? What... what have  you got to lose? My sanity. My job. My fiancee. You know, stuff like that. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. You-you're a doctor, right? I thought doctors... they're  supposed to help people, Aren't they? People. Flesh-and-blood people. (door closes) (monitor beeping rhythmically) I am so sorry. (monitor beeping rhythmically, ventilator hissing) (people speaking indistinctly) The bullet caused a catastrophic collapse of your son's central nervous system. He meets our criteria for brain death. He looks like he's breathing. He's not. The ventilator is doing it. His heart is beating. There's hope. Hope for what? I-I don't mean that in a disrespectful way. What do you hope for? I c... Your son could help a lot of people. I just... What if he wakes up? He's not going to. How can you be certain? He could save a girl's life. That I know. That's certain. You need to... just give me some time. Unfortunately... there isn't any. He's still my son. That's never gonna change. You ready to lasso that bullet? Absolutely. You know it's only 'cause she wants you, right? Who? The  milf. You've been talking to Zach. You should ask her out. She is my patient. That's the beauty of being a surgeon... once the stitches are out... bam... you are in. You know what? Contrary to what you might have heard, Dawn, I'm not really a one-night-stand kind of guy. Oh, right. You hold the torch. Olympic longing. You know, it's funny, I don't really see you married To anyone who isn't Charlie Harris. (singsongy) Ride 'em, cowboy. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Joel : Show me the heart. Dawn : Watch the tricuspid valve, between the atrium and the ventricle. (machine beeps) (beep) Show me the right ventricle, please. I cannot see the wire. She's got arrhythmia. You gotta go faster through the heart. I have a few very difficult turns in here, Dawn. Then make them. I will if you stop backseat driving. Man up and I'll be a mouse. Okay. I'm just kissing it... Now. There we are. Okay, hang on a second, guys. Just gonna tighten the noose. Okay. Keep it smooth. Mm-hmm. Slowly. Mm-hmm. Slowly. (clicks, beeps) Goddamn it. I lost it. Okay, uh, I can get it back. It's in the pulmonary artery. Yes, I can see that, Dawn. Thank you very much. (monitor beeping erratically) Okay, we gotta crack her. Get it out. Victor : B.P. is dropping. Heart rate is up to 110. Sats are 85. Joel : Just... Her heart rate is all over the place. We gotta open her. I can get it out, Dawn. You're gonna kill her. I just need a second to go in and do this, all right? You can't do this. Shut up, Dawn! (machinery beeping) Step aside, please. Edna, bring that in. Okay. (beeping continues) (clicks) Yes. (clanks) (monitor beeping rhythmically) I'm sorry, Dawn. I should not have told you to shut up. That was really... that was very rude. Are you kidding me? (laughs) That was great. You ever want to have a good time with somebody you're not in love with, you call me. Charlie : You tubed him? Yeah. I've been increasing the fraction of oxygen on the ventilator. His sats keep dropping? Yeah. (monitor beeping rhythmically) It's respiratory distress syndrome. His lungs are filling with fluid. So I should do a chest X-ray? Yeah. And then? Then we wait. Some people get better. Some don't. Charlie : Things haven't been going the way we would have liked with your husband. His injuries are putting a huge strain on his system. Um, we're trying to keep him oxygenated. He's not in any pain. (inhales deeply) Okay. Uh, Lucy, this is... this is gonna sound kind of strange, but, um... Nick wanted me to talk to you about your baby's name. What? When? In the ambulance. Something about "Jedi"? (laughs) Yeah. (laughs) He loves that name. (laughing) Uh, uh, what about... Joseph. Joseph? No, I gotta go with, uh, with Nick's wishes. no, that's-that's-that's his wish. Um, Joseph... After her father. After your father. My father? Joseph Nick. That's a good name. Yeah. (chuckles) I'll call him "Jedi" for short. (laughs) (sniffles) (exhales) (indistinct conversations) Hey, I heard you found that girl a liver. Yeah. Her family's up north. They're coming down. Do I get a reprimand? Uh, for what, not filling out any forms or asking any permission whatsoever? The transplant team is taking out his liver as we speak. I'm just gonna stick around. Cool. Okay. So I was gone, Joel. Mm-hmm. And I don't know if it's that I'm slow or... Like you said... or that I'm different, or-or what, but I feel different. I don't know if I'm the same kind of doctor that I was before. Well, are you better, or are you worse? I have no idea. But Reycraft scooping my surgery from me this morning, there is no way I would have allowed that to happen a year ago. You just found a liver For a girl who would have died otherwise. Do me a favor. Get in there. Oh,  and...  you are talking about your feelings... by the way. (indistinct conversations continue) (huffs) (monitor beeping rhythmically) Knife. (woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.) (Ryan speaking indistinctly) Hi there. Hey. I have something for you. Um, he can take it for show and tell. (rattles) Wow. Thank you. No problem. Look at that. You're welcome. Hey, uh, Ryan thought of a joke for you. Okay. Yeah. That, um, that was sort of more of a ploy to make him sit through the operation. Listen, my 8-year-old son, he thought of a joke for you. You're gonna sit down and you're gonna listen to it And you're gonna laugh your ass off, 'cause it's really freakin' funny. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Okay. Okay. (exhales) Lay it on me. So a man walks into the emergency room and yells, "doctor! Doctor! I'm shrinking!" (knocks) (people speaking indistinctly) Hey. Hey. Uh, Shahir said I should come and talk to you. Oh. Uh, have a seat. No, thank you. I'll, uh, I'll stand. That's a... a nice fern. Thanks. Um... Okay, there's this thing that I need to talk about, but, um, I can't talk about it, so, uh... "I watch death." You know what that means? Yeah. That's the mnemonic for the organic causes of hallucinations. Right. Uh, what are the psychological causes that, uh, someone or a patient might be hallucinating? Uh, pathological bereavement, pathological depression, postpartum psychosis. (people continue speaking indistinctly) Okay. We're good. Okay. Uh, Dr. Harris, if you do want to... Oh. Sorry. Talk about... What was that? Uh... I have no idea. Hmm. There's a couch in your office. Yes. It's for healing the mind. I know. You know, if people knew what we did on this couch... Mm. They'd get better so fast. (indistinct conversations) Katie? Do you mind if I keep you company?
