 Well, it could be an acute OSA. 
 I don't have sleep apnea. 
 How do you know? 
 'Cause my airways aren't constricted, oxygen levels in my blood haven't dropped, and I don't snore... much. 
 [ clears throat ] 
 I just wish you were sleeping more. 
 Baby, I slept. 
 For like three months I slept. 
 [ chuckles ] 
 I'm good till like 2020. 
 [ siren wailing ] 
 Thank you. 
 What about a new bed? 
 New bed? 
 Yeah. We've had that thing forever. 
 Eh, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
 [ chuckles ] So, what do you say? 
 New bed, fresh start. 
 Mm... 
 Could be a good thing. 
 Woman : Pourquoi? je ne comprends pas. 
 I'm thinking pillow top... 
 Hello? Hello? 
 And queen, not king, because you're basically sleeping... 
 Mais regardez-moi! Pourquoi vous ne me regardez pas? 
 Je vous en prie. 
 Qu'est-ce qui se passe? 
 Hey, Charlie. 
 Am I bed-shopping alone here? 
 [ indistinct conversations ] 
 Um... 
 Where'd you go? 
 Pillow top. 
 We were talking about p-pillow top, right?

 Gentlemen. 
 Joel Goran. How are you? 
 Doug Wilkens. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 This is Mark Forsythe, Ricki's coach. 
 Hey, man. How are you? 
 Your daughter's a hell of a player, mate. 
 Yeah. 
 I've actually only ever seen her on television, but she's got amazing ground speed. 
 20 winners in yesterday's third-round match. 
 I saw that. Only two unforced errors, right? 
 Yeah, and all on a bum knee. 
 Listen, doctor. I hear that you're the best. 
 Well, my daughter deserves nothing but the best. 
 Well, I'm glad you called. 
 Ohh! 
 ♪ come on, man, giddyup ♪ 
 She tweaked it going for too much on a key second serve. 
 I should've taken something off the first, kicked it out wide. 
 But you didn't. 
 You pulled out the big gun, you got yourself into trouble, and then you tweaked the damn knee again. 
 So, these incision scars you have here... these are from previous scopes, right? 
 Doug : Yeah, she's been having cartilage scraped since the year she turned pro. 
 Yeah, I got to be honest with you... it feels like there's more damage. 
 [ chuckles ] So what? 
 Shot of cortizone... right as rain, right? 
 Uh, I won't know the extent of the damage unless I get more imaging. 
 Well, she's playing in the quarterfinals this afternoon. 
 Yeah, that's not a good idea. 
 We don't want to mess with her mechanics in the middle of the tour. 
 Yeah, there's significant swelling around her patella. 
 [ chuckles ] 
 This is the busiest part of the tour, doctor, you know, balancing everybody's schedules. 
 Do you have any idea what that's like? 
 I do, yeah, actually. 
 Look, um, you called me. 
 I just want to find out what's wrong with your daughter's knee. Why don't we do this? 
 Let's get her in for an MRI right away, take a couple of pictures, and just, you know, see if we can't rule out any serious damage. 
 Okay. 
 You get her in, you get her out, you take care of this, and we're forever in your debt. 
 Good. 
 Okay. 
 [ helicopter blades whirring ] 
 You, uh, covering call in the O.R. again? 
 Beats selling mattresses. 
 Can I give you some advice? 
 Can I stop you? 
 You need a niche, Reid, if you want to get ahead. 
 [ telephone rings ] 
 Case in point... 
 I'm about to perform a lap whipple. 
 Lap whipple. Impressive. 
 The most difficult surgery known to man, right? 
 My niche. 
 Good for you, Reycraft. 
 Think about it. 
 [ siren wailing ] 
 Your niche. 
 I'd hate to see you get passed over for a staff job. 
 I'd miss you. 
 Don't look at me. I'm just a lowly E.R. doc. 
 Performing lap whipples. 
 [ laughs ] 
 [ woman whimpering ] 
 Somebody, help me! 
 [ gasping ] I need a stretcher! 
 We'll take it from here, sir. 
 [ groans ] 
 Penetrating neck trauma... knife wound, zone two, clear platysmal violation. 
 Where's the trauma bay? 
 We'll take her in from here. 
 I have my finger on her carotid artery. 
 If I remove it, she'll bleed out. 
 [ crying ] 
 Zach : All right, here we go, guys, on three. 
 One, two, three. 
 Oxygen, 100%. 
 Get some leads on her! 
 Yeah, we got it. 
 Call X-ray. 
 She'll need two large-bore I.V.S I know. Start the crystalid. 
 Run it wide open. 
 Get me six units, cross-matched. 
 She's AB Negative. 
 I need to get control of the wound now, doctor...? 
 Nazir. 
 Gently. She's my wife. 
 Yep. 
 I'll just take a look at the... 
 Yup, that's the carotid. 
 Alima. 
 [ speaking arabic ] 
 Dr. Nazir, is that your wife's blood? 
 [ exhales sharply ] No, it's mine. 
 Okay, can I get some help over here? 
 This guy's been cut! 
 Hey, don't bother about me. 
 I-it's minor. Just take care of Alima. 
 Let's get her to O.R. 
 This guy's intense. 
 [ heart monitor beeping ] 
 What's up? 
 Come see. 
 [ exhales sharply ] 
 Oh. I waited, but no one came. 
 The wound's superficial, so I thought I'd do it myself. 
 Check out his stitch. 
 Hey, is that a mattress stitch? 
 Where did you learn how to do that? 
 This is all my fault. 
 Some kid grabbed Alima's purse. 
 I tried to step in and stop him. 
 He pulled a knife. 
 [ exhales sharply ] 
 What is Alima's status? 
 I repaired her carotid artery. She's stable. 
 Is her, uh, blood work and imaging back? 
 I was just going to check. 
 [ groans ] Good. Let's go. 
 [ indistinct conversations ] 
 [ telephone ringing ] 
 Hi, Jay. 
 Hi, Arwen. 
 Arwen : Haven't you heard? 
 Everybody's calling us "Jaywen" now. 
 Right, Jaywen? 
 That's right, Jaywen. 
 Hey, you two play your cards right, everyone will be calling you "Gaggie" soon. 
 Yikes. 
 Blarg. 
 You said it. 
 Ugh. Don't you dare. 
 Come on. 
 Look. It's beautiful. 
 You are beautiful. 
 You guys are sweet. 
 I actually came to listen to your chest, Jay. 
 So, Arwen, big day today. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you nervous? 
 Your lungs sound like they're improving. 
 I think you got this pneumonia beat. 
 Well, that's one down, osteosarcoma to go. 
 Dr. Murphy, Dr. Lin, Jaywen. 
 Arwen : Dr. Hamza. 
 Let me guess. 
 You've come to EEG my posterior cranial fossa. 
 Actually, yes, and to C.T. your neoplasm. 
 Jay and I have bets on my tumor. 
 I say it's shrinking. 
 And I say it's not. 
 Well, then, prepare to lose 50 bucks, Jaywen. 
 You mean, get better, go back to the soo, marry a steelworker? 
 I'd rather stay here with you. 
 Wait. I'm sorry. 
 Um, can you wait till I'm finished? 
 I'll walk you down. 
 I'll walk her down. Don't worry. 
 No, thanks. Dead woman walking. 
 Hey, Arwen. 
 How you feeling today? 
 What are you doing? 
 Asking you how you're feeling today. 
 No. What are you doing? 
 Asking you how... 
 You just lost me. 
 I hate you! 
 Oh... 
 I hate you! 
 I hate you! 
 Arwen. 
 Calm down. Are you okay? 
 Okay, so, this is the MRI of your knee. 
 That is your cartilage there. 
 It's fine. 
 However, your meniscus... it's pretty badly damaged. 
 What are you saying? 
 She needs a meniscus transplant. 
 What? No. 
 Hear me out, please. 
 What I would do is secure an allograft to the shinbone, replacing the meniscus completely. 
 That should alleviate the concentric stresses, give you back the shock absorption that you've lost from years of playing. 
 And look... I would recommend doing this now before developing arthritis. 
 Ricki's playing the french in less than three weeks. 
 Well, she wouldn't be able to. 
 Look... this recovery, including your physio... 
 You're looking at at least six months. 
 [ laughs ] 
 Come on. 
 Ricki, look, you're the one that has to deal with this pain in your knee. 
 Hey, if Ricki has a pain in her knee, we all have a pain in our knee. 
 Well... 
 It's up to you, champ. 
 I have to play in the open. 
 If you don't have this operation soon, you might not be able to walk in 10 years. 
 Hey, she's made her decision. 
 Okay, I wish I could tell you what you want to hear. 
 It's just... 
 That's okay. 
 Someone will. 
 [ sighs ] 
 Oh. 
 For your trouble. 
 "Me and ricki: One father's journey to tennis superstardom." 
 You should check out chapter five. 
 There's an orthopedic surgeon makes an appearance. 
 [ chuckles ] He's a total hack. 
 Afternoon. 
 Sorry if this hurts, Mr. Moodie. 
 Oh, that's okay. You're not gonna hurt me. 
 ♪ I feel good ♪ 
 Well, that means the sedative's working, and that's good. 
 By the way, call me Kevin. 
 Uh, yeah. Kevin, how did you dislocate your hip? 
 That's not an easy thing to do. 
 Walking our dogs. 
 We have 12 dogs. 
 They're rescues. 
 Shasta takes off. 
 She's still on leash, gets caught between my legs, flips me on my back... boom... I'm lying in excruciating pain. 
 Shasta's in obedience training. 
 It's not working out so well. 
 Okay, well, we're going to put you under and get that hip back in place. 
 Now, Julie, you can either wait outside or stay here. 
 I'll stay. 
 Okeydokey. 
 Push of propofol. 
 [ heart monitor beeping ] 
 [ indistinct speaking over P.A. ] 
 [ exhales sharply ] Is he out? 
 You got it? 
 Yep. 
 Nope. 
 Put some muscle into it. 
 [ bones crack ] 
 What was that? 
 Uh... 
 [ speaking arabic ] 
 [ speaking arabic ] 
 [ voice breaking ] I'm sorry. 
 [ speaking arabic ] 
 [ speaking arabic ] 
 [ clears throat ] 
 What's worrying me is that she doesn't seem to be clotting. 
 Her coags are off, her platelets are low, and her INR is-is 1.7. 
 Her wound is still oozing. 
 Could be her liver... portal hypertension? 
 No, she's suffered massive blood loss, spent all her clotting factors. 
 This happens with trauma patients. 
 She just needs time. 
 Dr. Nazir, there are a couple cops in the E.R. 
 They just want to talk to you about the stabbing, get a statement. 
 Brought you some clean clothes. 
 Thank you. 
 We'll give you a few minutes. 
 [ cellphone vibrating ] 
 That's a little unorthodox, you letting him treat his own wife, no matter how awesome he is. 
 I was given a lot of leeway when it came to Charlie's care. 
 I'm just paying it forward. 
 [ telephone rings ] 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 You paged? 
 Yeah. Have you looked into memory foam? 
 You paged me to talk beds? 
 No. I actually paged you to watch you walk through the door. 
 That never gets old. 
 [ monitors beeping ] 
 What's going on with you? 
 Listen, I'm sorry for, um... zoning out on you earlier. 
 That was not cool. 
 Truth? 
 Always. 
 [ inhales sharply ] 
 We're not getting married right now. 
 We decided that. No need, right? 
 Right. 
 But the bed thing... 
 I mean [chuckles] I know it seems ridiculous, but it's our place, Charlie. 
 It's important to me. 
 Okay. I got it. 
 Okay. 
 You mad at me? 
 No. Are you mad at me? 
 No. 
 Okay, then. 
 Okay. 
 Better get back. 
 I'm gonna watch you walk away. 
 I have Kevin Moodie's scans. 
 Okay. 
 What do they tell us? 
 The bone looks moth-eaten. 
 Okay. That's not enough. 
 What about the blood work? 
 Hemoglobin's 45, platelet count is 50... both super low... and his white blood cell count is a sky-high 200. 
 Okay, Dr. Lin. 
 What's our next move? 
 [ sighs ] We tell him. 
 I wish this was better news, Kevin, but, um, the blood work has confirmed that you have leukemia. 
 Which is why I broke your leg. 
 Your bones and joints are very fragile. 
 You're gonna need chemotherapy, followed by a bone-marrow transplant. 
 Now, that's assuming that we can find the right donor. 
 Do you have siblings? 
 Do you have kids? 
 Our dogs are our children. 
 Okay. 
 We'll put your name in the registry and see if we can find a suitable match. 
 Um, obviously, the key going forward will be to learn to stay positive. 
 [ voice breaking ] 
 Well, he's definitely got a lot of love. 
 All right. In the meantime, I'd like to get you into surgery and repair that leg. 
 Black? 
 Thank you. 
 The police have her attacker in custody. 
 That's good. 
 Mm. They showed me photos, and there he was. 
 Well, that's a relief, at least. 
 Hmm. 
 A fellowship in hepatopancreatobiliary surgery. 
 Say that five times fast. 
 [ chuckles ] 
 Is this for you? 
 I have to find my niche. 
 I don't understand this mania for specialization. 
 Why not generalize, help more people with more problems? 
 Don't you have a niche? 
 I'm a trauma surgeon. 
 It should be about the patients, not the doctor or, uh, the gadgets. 
 That's not the way it is. 
 It should be. 
 [ woman over P.A. ] 
 Code white, room 314, code white. She's ripping her lines out and freaking out. Alima, Alima! [ speaking arabic ] Alima! She needs sedation. Let us work. 2 milligrams haloperidol. Move! Move! Scratch the haloperidol. She's seizing. 2 milligrams of lorazepam. Please... let me take care of her! Just let him go. Let him go. Okay. Oxygen, wide open. Where's my lorazepam? Alima. Alima. [ Alima groaning ] Sharp out! Give me the syringe. Steady her shoulder. I've got this. I'll do it! Doctor, I've got this. Alima. Alima. [ breathing heavily ] Any evidence of electrolyte imbalance? Alex : None. No reason to believe she's having an adverse reaction to the medication we've been giving her. She's not epileptic. Right, and no sign of stroke or brain injury. C.T.s are normal? Yeah. And the tox screen was negative for benzos. Of course. Wait. Her alcohol levels were through the roof. Alcohol? Yeah. When they brought her in, your wife was drunk. Oh, that's impossible. And now the alcohol's leaving her system. Delirium tremens? Seizures, aggression. It fits with the D.T.s. My wife doesn't drink. This is absurd. If she has cirrhosis from alcoholism, that would explain why she's not clotting. [ coughs ] She's spitting up blood. We need to move forward fast. We have to find the source of the bleeding. Let's get her into endoscopy. I'll book a room for you. Okay, let's turn her. One, two, three. [ gasps ] Dr. Reid, I'd like to go with you. Of course. We're a team now. [ telephone rings ] Hey. Come on in, man. I'm hearing rumors that Ricki Wilkens is floating around. What can I do for you, Charlie? I reshuffled my O.R. block. I need you to sign off on it. "Ricki and me," huh? You doing her surgery? Nope. That's a badly damaged lateral meniscus. Would you do a transplant on that knee? Oh, hell, yeah. It's the only way. Recovery's a bitch, though. Yeah. It's not the news that superdad wanted to hear, so he is taking the famous knee elsewhere. That's too bad. It would have brought some profitable attention to the hospital. Well, she didn't want the surgery, so I had to let her walk. That happens. You would've done the same thing? No. I would have made her want what I want. The glioma didn't react to the chemotherapy as we'd hoped. The tumor remains 4 1/2 centimeters and is still impinging on the brain stem. So, it's inoperable. And she knows? I think she was expecting bad news. That explains why she was so angry earlier. She was probably terrified. Now, these types of tumors often precipitate radical swings in emotion. Either way. [ sighs ] So, can we begin our session with you telling me about hope and silver linings and glittery unicorns? I'm sorry that the chemo didn't shrink the tumor. Whatever. Six months, all my hair. But, hey, I won 50 bucks. Silver lining. Now I want to hear about the glittery unicorns. Okay. Well, what is a unicorn? Let's start there. A horse freak. Because of the horn? Yeah. Horses don't have horns. I know. I used to ride them. Do you feel like you're a freak? May as well be. [ voice breaking ] I'm 16 and I have this stupid tumor the size of a plum and it's gonna kill me, like, soon. And I broke up with my boyfriend. Yeah, maybe let's talk about that. Why did you break up with Jay? Okay, no infection. Looks good. Hey, Dr. Lin, have you heard anything about Arwen? I'm sorry I can't discuss a patient's care with someone who isn't family. Got to be family, huh? Why don't you ask her yourself? She's not gonna talk to me again. Why is that? [ sighs ] It was a deal-breaker. See, we have these things, these deal-breakers, and I knew that was hers. And we made this pact. I wasn't supposed to ask her how she was feeling. So, why did you, then? I don't know. Maybe you wanted her to break up with you? I don't know. What's your deal-breaker? Well, I've got doctors poking and, you know, pushing at me all day, so... [ chuckles ] I'm like their personal pincushion. No offense. So, I don't know. I don't... I don't like being touched. [ breathes deeply ] So, Arwen never touches you? No. That's my thing. Gail, no. No, I'm-I'm gonna be okay. Just stay put. No. Don't pack everyone up. Okay, sir... phone, please. Gail, I'm gonna be fine. Just please don't cry. Victor? Please don't cry. I'm sorry, sir. It's time to say goodbye. I got to go, honey. Bye. I love you. Children : Bye! We love you! [ sighs ] 
 
 I thought you didn't have kids? Oh, I-I-I don't. That's, uh... they're Julia's sister's. [ monitors beeping ] Okay, we've achieved good fixation. [ exhales sharply ] Bone-cement gun. We don't have a lot of time. The cement's starting to set. Yep. We'll fill in the defect, and then we'll close. [ gun clicking ] [ monitor beeping erratically ] What did you do? His sats are dropping. Cement must have pressurized the canal. Could be a fat embolism. I don't know, but he's going into V-fib. Call in the code. Get him closed up. We need to shock him. Get the pads on him. Stapler, please. [ woman over P.A. ] Code blue, O.R. 1. Code blue, O.R. 1.[/i] Code blue, O.R. 1.[/i][/i] What... Oh, crap. What the hell? That's not good. Dr. Harris, are we closing? Yeah. [ defibrillator humming ] Clear. [ monitor emits tone ] Using a six-shooter sucks the varices in, wraps an elastic around them, stops the bleeding. [ air hissing ] Hmm. Doesn't seem to be stopping. There's a lot of blood. Yeah. We may need to try something else. What are you thinking? Another, uh, gadget? A better gadget... called T.I.P.S. We don't have time for T.I.P.S. Her liver isn't working. We need to open her up, do a Warren shunt. A Warren shunt? That's one of the most invasive surgeries there is. And an incision that big? She's lost too much blood. She won't survive a big surgery. All due respect, before coming here, in Syria, I was performing surgery in a cave, under fire. You want a niche? Blood is my niche. So, trust me. Do the Warren shunt. You need to trust me here. If we don't do this, she's not going to survive. Okay. If we did a Warren shunt... [ knock on door ] Zach, what's up? Reid, can you just step outside here for a minute, please? [ indistinct speaking over P.A. ] What is it? There was an airport limo double-parked earlier, blocking the ambulance bay. Okay. So, they find blood on the seat. I guess he was driving with one hand, compressing her neck with the other. It's unbelievable. He's not a doctor. He's a limo driver. You lied to me. You're not a doctor. Of course I'm a doctor. Really? Airport limo says otherwise. Dr. Reid... You treated a patient. You put all of us... this hospital, me... in serious jeopardy. Just because this country doesn't accept my accreditation doesn't mean... You tried to talk me into doing a massive surgery! Do you even understand the liability? Liability?! She's my wife! And if she wasn't your wife, I would kick you out on your ass right now! Prep her for T.I.P.S. [ door opens ] Why won't you listen to me? I did listen. Oh, right, now that I'm just a chauffeur. This is my decision as her doctor. Please. I brought her here to save her life. Take Mrs. Nazir to O.R. 2. I'll be right there. You... you can watch from the gallery. [ heart monitor beeping ] Uh, how long till I wake up? Don't know, Kev, but a fat embolism is a lot less serious than a blood clot, so... Looks pretty serious. Well, that machine over there is breathing for you, but the embolism will pass. You will wake up. When? You see, it's really important that I wake up now. Oh, no. This isn't happening. What? Okay, here's what you're gonna do. Julia's home getting clothes. When she comes back, if you head her off, then she won't see Gail and the girls. Gail is... My wife. My other wife. You've got two wives? Yeah. [ chuckles nervously ] Those are my girls... Kelly and Sassy. So, your wife Julia doesn't know about the... No, none of it. Well, this is quite a situation, Kevin. I-I met Gail, and, well, we started a family. And I was really happy and then, uh... Well, I met Julia and I was really happy, too. I don't know. It just kind of happened. [ chuckles ] Okay, well, bigamy aside, um, you're sick. And you need a bone-marrow transplant if you're gonna have a real shot of surviving this. And the best shot you're gonna have of finding a match is gonna be with one of your daughters. So, I'm thinking... maybe time to come clean with all of this. So... a chauffeur posing as a surgeon. What is this, "the Bourne identity"? Am I in trouble? No, of course not. Come on. He snowed everyone. The thing is, is he kind of inspired me, you know? And it felt good. I guess I'm just disappointed. [ pager beeps, vibrates ] So, stay inspired. Looks good on you. Hey. My father talked to other orthopods. All of them said I'd be able to play without the surgery. Okay. I think they're wrong, but glad that you guys have found someone you think you can work with. Well, that's the thing. You're the only surgeon who looked me in the eye and talked to me... not my father, not my coach... me. Does your father know that you're here? [ chuckles ] Thinks I'm getting a bikini wax. Look, I know how much pain your knee must be in right now. "Suck it up." That's what I've been told my whole life. Look, he's not a monster. I'm not saying that he is, but, Ricki, you know, overbearing fathers are kind of a dime a dozen. [ sighs ] Tennis is all I know. Well, knees are kind of my thing, and I am telling you right now you need that surgery. Well, an average bikini wax lasts about 10 minutes. So... convince me. All set? All set. Dr. Reid, can you take a look at this? Yeah. [ monitor beeping ] [ sighs ] This is not good. Dr. Ray : Not good, no. She's hypotensive. And she's not making urine. Doesn't matter how much blood we give her. Victor : Let's move, then. Uh, guide wire? No. No guide wire. Get rid of the fluoroscope. Let's go. Change of plans. I'm going to be doing a Warren shunt. Get me a major vascular tray and a Thompson retractor. And page Reycraft. We're gonna need hands. This incision's gonna be big and wide. Get ready, folks. [ woman over P.A. ] Dr. Reycraft, O.R. 2, stat. Dr. Reycraft, O.R. 2, stat.[/i][/i] I've mobilized the retroperitoneum. I'll tie off the veins draining the stomach and pancreas. She's still bleeding a lot. Then let's motor. Pick-ups? Have you isolated the splenic and portal vein? Pretty sure. It's impossible to see with all this blood. I can't even see the left renal vein. Well, we need to anastomose the splenic to the left renal vein, so let's find it. Gemini. [ heart monitor beeping ] Gemini. Dr. Ray : Her heart rate's up. Pressure dropping. I'm trying to find it, but I just can't... I'm not gonna be able to handle the blood loss at this rate. Whatever you're doing, do it quick, before she crashes. Reycraft, can you see it? No. It's a bloodbath. Damn it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you out of your mind? Do you want her to die? Because I don't. Lady, you are steely, and I like it. Still nothing, huh? No, I can't see anything. You can't find the renal vein, can you? Nope, but you're gonna help us. Talk me through the Warren shunt. I'm with you. Thank you. [ indistinct conversations ] [ strings tuning ] What's going on today? Flash mob? It's a special day at Hope Zion. Okay. Where are you taking me, exactly? Seat, monsieur? [ chuckles ] Um, n-no, thank you. Oh, come on, Jay. Humor me. Come on. There you go. You did this? Yeah. Oh, sorry. Actually, I don't... okay. Dr. Murphy, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. I am serious. I am gonna tip this wheelchair over if you don't take me out. No. Bring me back to the room. Maggie : It's gonna be fine. Arwen, just give him one minute. One. You're fired, and I want a new shrink. So, this was your idea? No. No, no, no. No, this-this is... this is them. Enjoy. [ Carly Rae Jepsen's "call me maybe" plays ] Nice table. Nice string quartet. I think this is gonna go well. [ sighs ] Could go either way. Yeah. [ "call me maybe" continues ] [ monitors beeping ] Enjoy. Joel : Excuse me. What do you think you're doing here? I'm observing the surgery, of course. I don't think so, no. I filled out all the requisite forms, so, yes, I am. I don't perform to a crowd. I can't believe you went behind my back for all this. Hey. You can save your chat for later. Look, I just want to make sure that my little knee gets through this okay. Look, it's not really your little knee, is it, mate? [ chuckles ] It's Ricki's little knee. It's never just about Ricki. Actually, right now it is. What you don't understand is that she is an industry. What she is, is in pain, a lot more pain than she's been telling you about. I'm about to fix that. Okay. Okay. I'm just gonna stand right over here... Get the hell out of my O.R. If I knew it was that easy to tell off my dad... Actually, it wasn't that easy, but I'll tell you... strangely satisfying. [ sighs ] Hi, Kevin. [ groans ] Dr. Harris. What happened? Am I okay? Um, you suffered what's called a fat embolism during your surgery. You've been unconscious for a couple hours. What's the last thing you remember? [ sighs ] I was on the phone. And nothing after that? No. No. I woke up, and here we are. [ chuckles ] Okay. Well, um, it's time to talk to your wives, Kevin. One of your daughters could be a bone-marrow match, and we can start your treatments right away. Daughters? Sorry. I know your secret, Kevin. There are two women out there and two adorable little girls who call you daddy. They all want you to live. How did you... I just... I know, okay? Now, either you tell them, or I will. Your secrets are your business, Kevin, But keeping you alive is mine. [ monitors beeping ] I'm not ready. Well, you better get ready 'cause it's truth-telling time. [ monitors beeping ] Okay. Okay, finished dissecting. You're going to suture the shunt now. How's your suturing? Excellent when I can see what I'm doing. 7-0 double-armed prolene. Okay. Run the back wall of the anast first, toe to heel, outside in on the renal vein. You can leave no room for error. Got it. And you won't be able to open her back up after all the blood she's lost. I know. I need quiet. [ monitors beeping ] [ beeping continues ] Let's unclamp. Wait. Wait for what? There's no time to wait. You're rushing. Sometimes you need to go slow to go fast. But we need to unclamp to get the blood flow back. Slowly. You need to pinch the vein so the redirection of flow Does not overwhelm the anastomosis. Okay. Pinch the vein. Now what? You've created a delicate connection. You don't want to tear that connection apart. No. I really don't. Now let go carefully. Let's unclamp. [ monitors beeping ] Letting go. We've got flow back. Are you sure? I'm-I'm sure. Any leaks? No. No, it looks good. Dr. Ray : Her heart rate's coming down. Pressure improving. You did it. [ exhales deeply ] [ sighs ] [ indistinct speaking over P.A ] I bet there are only a handful of surgeons in this entire country who could have done what you just did. [ sighs ] Well, you're a great teacher... and a hell of doctor. [ chuckles ] "Was." [ sighs ] Our son died. I was working in a field hospital. Alima couldn't get to me. She had to live with that alone for days. When she finally did get to me... I just kept working. Then the government started killing doctors and their families, so we ran. [ sighs ] I should have seen the signs with Alima. I-I am a doctor. I-I should have helped her. Being a doctor has nothing to do with it. You're right. I need to stop being her doctor. Now she needs a husband. You don't need to do this to yourself. I'm okay. [ voice breaking ] No, really, really. I'm okay. Do you feel that? Yep. Okay. Nerves are reacting well. Pulse is very strong. It's good. I've never taken six months off in my life, not since I was 6. [ chuckles ] Well, that could be a blessing in disguise. You bet it is. Once I'm up and moving again, I'm gonna go on a huge trip. [ chuckles ] I've been to hundreds of countries, but I've only seen their tennis facilities. Is your father gonna come with you? He's not talking to me. But that's a good thing... for now. Okay. Hey, uh, Dr. Goran, can you pass my bag? Sure. Pick a number between 1 and 10. Pick a number for... Just any number between 1 and 10. 3. Okay. 3. [ indistinct speaking over P.A. ] For the hospital. I probably should have said a higher number. [ chuckles ] Slap my name on something. A wing. [ telephone ringing ] Jay? Oh, she didn't forgive you? [ chuckles ] Psych. It's hers. Wow, dude, she put a ring on it. So, you're back together? We're gonna get married. Well, when our parents sign the releases. We're gonna be family. I'm just really very pleased for you both. [ sighs ] Why waste time, right? Definitely. Joel. Alex. Hey. Hey. Trauma. What are you talking about? Well, that's gonna be my niche, if you can set it up. Okay. Trauma. No. There's better choices you can make if you want to get noticed. I-don't care about being noticed anymore, okay? I just... I want to do it all. So, trauma team leader position? Okay, well, I'll see what I can do. See what you can do? Mm-hmm. You're the chief. Yeah, I guess I am the chief, aren't I? Looks good on you. Charlie : But the good news is your daughter Sassy is a half-match and we can do a bone-marrow transplant. I couldn't say no. You are the father to my children. Thank you. Kevin has a good chance of getting through this, but, um, he's gonna need a lot of support. [ sighs ] I can be here on weekdays, I guess. Thank you. But I want a divorce. And I'm keeping the dogs because I hate you and so do they. [ monitors beeping ] [ sighs ] [ Andrew Austin's "sending out a message" plays ] Hey, Arwen?
