 Mail... mail... bills... 
 Ah. 
 "Dr. Charlie Harris." 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically, ventilator hissing) 
 Ooh. 
 "Here's wishing you a  Speedy Gonzales  recovery." 
 "Signed, your neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Bent." 
 Well, despite their sincere and well-meaning wishes, I'm gonna toss it. 
 Besides, they keep using our parking space. 
 (knocks on door) 
 Why is it I'm never prepared? 
 The signs are always there. I'm bitchy. I'm bloated. (sighs) 
 Do you have a tampon? 
 No. Sorry. 
 What? 
 Wait. I'm thinking in my head. 
 Are you late? 
 Yeah. 
 Charlie's accident was six weeks ago. 
 Are you usually late? 
 Don't try to doctor me, Mel. Uh, maybe it's stress. 
 Or... oh, my god... you're pregnant. 
 Alex : You... don't say that out loud! 
 A-and you can't tell anyone. Do you promise? 
 Okay. I promise. 
 It's probably not anything. 
 I'm gonna go... to my rounds. 
 Yeah. No. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Wait. 
 Pregnant? 
 (rips, rustling) 
 (exhales deeply) 
 (indistinct conversations, radio chatter) 
 35-year-old male driver in M.V.C. 
 Traveling approximately 50 kilometers an hour. 
 Air bags? 
 No. Accident happened around 30 minutes ago. 
 G.C.S. is 15. All vitals stable on scene. 
 Wow. That's amazing. Let me guess. 
 He hit the back of a truck carrying construction gack? 
 Uh-huh. 
 I love it when I'm right. 
 Uh, morphine? 
 None. 
 Why not? 
 We were worried about hypotension. 
 Then why isn't he screaming? 
 I don't know. 
 He should be in incredible, terrifying pain. 
 That is not normal. 
 How are you doing today? 
 I'm good. 
 Are you feeling any discomfort at all? 
 No. Not at all. 
 What's your name? 
 Uh... No idea. 
 Did he hit his head? 
 No. 
 All right. Well, we're gonna take good care of you. 
 Lin, let's make sure his airway's okay. 
 We'll reassess his vitals, open his I.V., slip in a catheter. 
 Get him to X-ray. 
 We'll do a chest and abdominal flat plate and a C.T. 
 Right away. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 (gurney wheels rattling) 
 Hey, Maggie. 
 Maggie : Hey, Joel. 
 Hey, I tried calling you last night. 
 You didn't answer. 
 I was at a movie or something, I guess. 
 Okay. Well, if you get a moment later on today, let's, uh, let's hang out. 
 Is that a "yes"? 
 Sure. For sure. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. 
 Okay. Well, uh, then I'll text ya. 
 Okay. With your fingers. Let's make a plan. 
 Is that rebar? 
 Yes, it is. 
 (water running) 
 "Mr. Happy"? 
 That's what we're calling him. 
 He has amnesia? 
 That's the working theory, and he doesn't feel any pain. 
 He has a piece of rebar sticking out his chest. 
 I know. 
 He should be in agony. 
 Yeah. Tell me about it. 
 I'm worried it might be tamponading an artery. 
 If we remove it, he could bleed out. 
 Rib fractures, front and back. 
 Do you want me to call Dr. Goran in? 
 I got it. 
 Mm. 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Reid. 
 Hi. 
 Ouch. How are you feeling, sir? 
 I'm feeling only good feelings. 
 Can you move your left leg for me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Good. Now your right leg. 
 You don't remember your name? 
 No. I was driving, and then, um, and then I hit a truck. 
 And you don't remember anything? Your address, a phone number? 
 No. 
 I'll see you in a few minutes. 
 Uh, you have kind eyes. 
 Thank you. 
 (curtain rings rattle) 
 Hi, Ms. Day. I am Dr. Lin. 
 It says here you fell down. 
 My mother pushed me down the stairs, and now I can't move my neck. 
 You can see it's crooked. 
 Can you bend your neck the other way? 
 No. 
 Did the paramedics give you any medication? 
 Mnh-mnh. Those medics weren't very sympathetic... or kinetic. 
 It's pathetic. 
 Yeah, they can be a little abrupt. 
 Okay, Heather, you just stay put, and we'll get your neck X-rayed as soon as we can, okay? 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 So it looks like the pole went through the third and fourth ribs, and he's got multiple fractures due to the force of the impact. 
 He's got a small lung contusion right there. 
 He has paradoxical motion of the chest wall and a hemopneumothorax. 
 Flail chest. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, well, due to the extent of the fractures, we're gonna have to stabilize the flail segment, but it is true... 
 He's in no pain? 
 Looks like it. 
 Any theories? 
 No. I'm guessing it has to do with the amnesia. 
 Drugs? 
 No. His tox screen is clear. 
 Go ahead. Talk to him yourself. Maybe you can figure it out. 
 You just don't have my amazing bedside manner. 
 Watch and learn. 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 Hi there. 
 Hi there. 
 I'm Dr. Goran. 
 So, listen, before I can operate, I need to know if you've taken any other medications which would explain why you are not feeling any pain. 
 No. I haven't taken a thing, you know, cross my heart. 
 Yeah. You got... that was a pretty... 
 Yeah. That was a strange thing to say. 
 All right. Mister... sir, uh, normally, before we operate, we wait till we get a bit of a medical history, but we really can't wait in this instance. 
 Dr. Reid will extract the rebar. 
 I will make an incision to make sure no blood vessels and organs have been damaged, okay? 
 And I will plate the ribs. 
 Oh. If this is your only issue, why wouldn't I just... 
 Hey, no, don't! 
 No! 
 (people gasping and murmuring) 
 (rebar clatters) 
 Propofol, 180. (monitor beeping rapidly) 
 Get him tubed! 
 I'm gonna do a crash thoracotomy. 
 (sighs) Oh, my god. How are we doing? 
 We're working on it. 
 Pressure's gone. Betadine? 
 Dump it on him. Do you have him tubed yet? 
 Now he is. 
 Great. 
 (ventilator hissing) Okay. Knife. 
 Yeah. 
 You gotta get in there. 
 Fifth interspace. (sighs) Here we go. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (sighs) Retractor. 
 Retraction coming in. 
 (panting) Going in. 
 Okay. You got the aorta? 
 Yeah. I think so. It's got a huge tear in it. 
 (sighs) 
 Suction. Right here. 
 (suction gurgling) Listen, you've gotta pump everything you've got into this guy... you know, blood, fluids, everything. 
 I'm gonna clamp the aorta proximal and distal to the tear. 
 Doctor. 
 And one more. 
 Okay, I think I have it controlled, but we don't have much time. 
 We need to fix the tear, remove the clamps, and restore blood flow to the spinal column. 
 His pressure's going back up. 
 (sighs) Holy hell. 
 (indistinct conversations, telephones ringing in distance) 
 (monitor beeps) 
 Heather? 
 It's best if you stay near your bed. 
 I'm waiting to see a doctor. 
 You don't need to see another doctor. 
 We're just waiting to get you into X-ray. 
 They keep changing all the rules. 
 Let's just get you back to bed for now. 
 Kapow. 
 You had a close call there, sir. 
 Well, yeah. 
 I guess pulling that thing out of my chest wasn't the best plan. 
 (chuckles) No, it really wasn't. 
 As I was trying to tell you, when you... 
 Yeah. 
 (sighs) Unimpaled myself. 
 A segment of your rib cage was detached. 
 Now I plated it back together, and Dr. Reid repaired the tear in your aorta. 
 (whispers) Wow. 
 You're lucky to be alive. 
 You guys are top-notch. 
 This hospital is top-notch. 
 What's the food like here? 
 Well, you're gonna be in rough shape for a bit. 
 I'm not sure that you're gonna want to eat quite yet. 
 Personal effects. 
 Let's take a look at this. 
 Is that my stuff? 
 We want to see if the medics missed anything. 
 Do you mind? 
 No. Please. Go ahead. 
 This is a morphine drip. 
 If the pain gets any worse, press that button. 
 Right. Remember, though, I'm not feeling any pain. 
 Still? 
 No. 
 (victor) Check this out. 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 Who is "The Great Randall"? 
 I have no idea. 
 He's a hypnotist. 
 A hypnotist? 
 Yeah. The great Randall. He does performances. 
 He's on all the talk shows. Do you guys never go out? 
 Are we thinking he's been hypnotized? 
 That is not what I was thinking, no. 
 Uh, what are we thinking? 
 I need to talk to Gavin. 
 In some people, hypnosis can have an extreme effect. 
 This extreme? 
 Hypnosis isn't entirely understood. 
 Some people's brains physiologically change under hypnosis. 
 Then there are the people who are especially suggestible, like those who were a victim of child abuse or spent time in cults. 
 We don't know this guy's story. 
 Why not just leave him hypnotized? 
 Because it's masking. 
 Morphine masks pain. I'm just sayin'. 
 I can't have a postoperative patient in a trance. 
 It's irresponsible. 
 I can't tell what's going on if he can't feel it. 
 I'm not a hypnotist. 
 Just try. Please? 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 I'm Gavin Murphy. I'm a psychiatrist here. 
 Uh... (sighs) I'd like you to take a deep breath... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And relax for me. 
 All right. (inhales and exhales deeply) 
 And follow my finger. (sighs) 
 Now I'm gonna count backwards from ten. 
 I want you to watch my finger until you get sleepy. 
 Ten... nine... 
 Have you done this before? 
 Yes. To great effect, I might add. 
 (singsongy) Mm-hmm. 
 (mouthing words) Eight... seven... six... 
 Watch the finger. 
 Are you, uh... Yeah, I'm watching. 
 (sighs) Actually, okay, I'm gonna get you to close your eyes. 
 Now? 
 Yes, please. 
 (clears throat) Close your eyes. 
 Yes. My eyes are now closed. 
 Now I want you to just let your mind wander. 
 Mm. 
 Let it wander wherever it wants to go. 
 Now tell me, what do you see? 
 My eyelids. 
 You'd better call the other guy. (sighs) 
 The great... 
 Randall. 
 (indistinct conversations, telephones ringing in distance) 
 Hey. You paged me? 
 Yeah, I have a patient with a neck injury who says her mom pushed her down the stairs. 
 Okay. That's not really a psych issue. 
 She's just acting really weird. Something's off. 
 In what way? 
 She's nonsensical. She's... rhyming randomly. 
 Rhyming? Out of the blue, no context to it? 
 None. 
 Sounds like it could be clang association. 
 Where is she? 
 Clang what? 
 It's, uh, it's a form of speech that includes rhyming. 
 It happens in patients that have m... 
 Heather : Hey! 
 I heard what you said. Hey! I heard it. 
 Don't pretend like you didn't. I am sick of you, too! 
 Hey, calm down. Calm down. 
 (voice breaking) Have shoes. Clues. Bruise. Blues. Clues. 
 Misuse. Bruise. 
 I need haloperidol and lorazepam. 
 What's her name? 
 Maggie : Heather. 
 "Why don't you just go kill yourself?!" 
 That's what they say to me all the time. (laughs) 
 "I'm not buying you any more presents!" 
 Okay. Hi, Heather. My name's Gavin. 
 You're too tall. You're too tall. (sniffles) 
 Can I just talk to you for a second? 
 You want to strap me down like an animal?! 
 Guys, guys, guys. Back off. Back off! Back off. 
 Back off. 
 I got it. 
 Heather. 
 Heather, I can tell that you're really upset. 
 Can we just talk about it for a little bit? 
 Gavin. Gavin. 
 (chuckles) Yeah, nothing rhymes with "Gavin," right? 
 You gave that picture a headache. 
 You're giving me a headache! 
 Gavin, we're gonna have to do this. she's a danger to the other patients. 
 Heather, we're gonna have to give you some medication, all right? 
 No. 
 It's gonna help you feel a little bit better, all right? 
 No. No. I don't w... I don't want it. 
 No, I don't want it! 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 I don't want it! (grunts) 
 There's just gonna be a pinch, all right? 
 Just a pinch. (strained voice) Okay. 
 Let go of me. You're ruining it. 
 All right? 
 You always ruin everything. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 (panting) 
 There you go. There you go. Grab her feet. Grab her feet. 
 (speaking indistinctly) There you go. It's okay. 
 Okay. 
 (strained voice) Okay. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. (sighs) 
 (TV playing indistinctly) 
 I couldn't take the test. 
 You mean you tried? 
 I went down to the pharmacy. 
 I-I bought a pee stick, but I didn't pee. 
 You should pee. It's better to know. 
 Is it? 
 Well, you can't avoid it forever. 
 Well, I would've avoided it a few months ago, too. 
 Juggling a kid while I'm still in my residency? 
 But now, even with everything... 
 I want it. 
 Then take the test. 
 (pager buzzes) 
 Ohh. (sighs) 
 (sighs) Gotta go. 
 (woman moans) 
 Charlie : Most people come into a hospital in some kind of pain. 
 (screaming) 
 The maternity ward, in particular, is filled with the agonized screams of women in labor. 
 (screaming continues) 
 It's the happiest place in the hospital. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Hi. 
 I'm here to see Dr. Reid. 
 What's the name? 
 Uh, Randall. 
 Mr.  Randall? 
 Uh, no. Just Randall. 
 She said to page her when I got here. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 (over P.A.) Dr. Reid, there's a Randall in reception for you. 
 Dr. Reid, Randall in reception. 
 Nice tux, buddy. 
 Randall? 
 That's me. 
 If you'll follow me. 
 Absolutely. 
 I want you to listen very carefully to the sound of my voice. 
 I want you to listen, but I don't want you to think. 
 I'm gonna count backwards from three, and on three, I'd like you to do three things. 
 I want you to close your eyes, I want you to take a deep breath, and I want you to relax your arms. 
 And on two, I want you to do two things... breathe out and imagine yourself in a quiet, quiet room. 
 And on one, I want you to do just one thing... look up. 
 And three... two... one. 
 Awake! 
 Did it work? 
 What's your name? 
 Chester Mills. 
 And what's your address, Chester? 
 202 westbridge drive. 
 Hey, no, no, no, no, no... Aah! 
 Oh, that... ohh! 
 Chester? 
 (strained voice) It hurts. My stomach hurts so bad! 
 Morphine's not working. 
 It will, Chester. 
 Ohh! 
 Push an extra 2 1/2. 
 Aah. 
 (groaning) 
 (monitor beeping erratically) 
 Did you say, "stomach"? 
 Yes! My stomach! 
 Why did you wake me up? 
 Why did you have to do that? Aah. 
 I was better off before. Aah! 
 Doctors call pain "the fifth vital sign," but unlike the other four, you want it to stop. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Careful of your sutures. 
 No, you know what? It is not the surgery. 
 That is really sore, But it's nothing compared to the pain... 
 That's why he came to me in the first place, right, this pain of his? 
 (strained voice) Ohh. 
 There's pain in his lower quadrant. 
 Is it possible that the catheter punctured his bladder? 
 We had a hard time getting it in. It's possible. 
 O-okay, s... Chester. (groans) 
 I am going to send you for a cystoscopy. 
 No. No, you're not. Listen, stop. 
 Please? Please stop. Please? 
 I've had this pain for  years,  all right? 
 How many years? 
 I don't know! 
 I don't know. Like, five, maybe. 
 I've seen a ton of doctors, a ton of doctors, and nobody ever helped me, nobody except for him today. 
 "I know but one freedom," 
 "and that is the freedom of the mind." 
 Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 
 Okay, Randall, you can't be in here. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 We are going to get to the bottom of this. 
 Nobody ever gets to the bottom of this. 
 Stop. Stop. Okay, can we just for a second just stop, take a... take a breath, just-just for a second, please, and listen? 
 Okay. 
 Yeah? I can't work, okay? 
 I have no money, and I can't get disability because everyone just thinks that this in my head, so don't... please just don't tell me that you're gonna fix me, because I don't believe you. 
 Listen, I'm gonna go over your medical records. 
 Just a fresh set of eyes. 
 I might be able to see something that the previous doctors have missed... 
 Ohh. And in the meantime, just to be safe, will you please take this one test? 
 What's the point? 
 You've just had surgery. You're in pain. 
 I want to make sure it's nothing we've done. 
 Uh... (sighs) 
 Fine. Yeah. Test me. 
 Thank you. 
 Will you please take Chester down to cysto? 
 And up his morphine. 
 (grunts) 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 What are you still doing here? 
 Oh. Who do I, uh, talk to about compensation? 
 For? 
 Well, for coming here and doing this. 
 Well, this is a hospital, not a stage show, so think of it as your good deed for the day. 
 You have a great sadness about you, Dr. Reid. 
 Right. 
 There you go, and thanks again. 
 (telephone rings in distance) 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 (button clicks) 
 So how come you can see me? 
 Do you mean no one else can? 
 No. 
 Because you're dead? 
 Not quite, but close. 
 (button clicks) Wait, wait, wait, wait! 
 No one else knows I'm here. Hey! 
 I need you to do something for me. 
 (lowered voice) No. 
 You do something for  me,  okay? 
 Leave me alone. 
 What? 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 That your rebar guy? 
 Yeah. Five years' worth of medical records. 
 He's been tested for lupus, crohn's, irritable bowel. 
 It's brutal. 
 Oh, well. 
 What do you mean, "oh, well"? 
 I mean, you got the thing out of his chest. 
 You saved his life. 
 You've done your part. Go with god. 
 Zach, this guy's seen a dozen internists. 
 Nobody's helped him. 
 You know, the key to not going crazy is that you help a patient, and when they're feeling better, you stop. 
 This guy feels worse again. 
 Yeah, but you only know about it because you didn't stop in time. 
 That's my point. 
 That's the emergency medicine way? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I get it. 
 You're numbing yourself with work. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Every doctor he's seen has failed Chester Mills. 
 I don't want to add my name to that list. 
 You didn't happen to keep the rebar, did you? 
 No. Why? 
 Just teaching purposes. It's fine. 
 Wait. 
 Ohh. 
 (lowered voice) Listen to me. 
 The last time they caught me talking to a dead guy, they put me in the mental, so buzz off! 
 I'm not dead, and the woman I love needs to know I'm trying to get back to her. 
 (sighs) Too bad. 
 I am not your savior. I am not your messenger. 
 Please! I am  begging  you! 
 (sighs) I think she's pregnant! 
 She needs to know that it's okay, that I-I want to be a father. 
 (sighs) 
 I didn't push her down the stairs. 
 She imagined it? 
 She believes it. 
 She has delusions. 
 Sometimes things happen. (sighs) 
 She fits them into a conspiracy. 
 Her neck does seem hurt. 
 We can X-ray it now that she's calmer. 
 Thank you. 
 Can you give us a minute? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 
 
 
 Does she go off her meds often? 
 (sighs) Sometimes. 
 I just noticed she's taking perphenazine. 
 I think there are more effective meds now. 
 We've tried everything. 
 And nothing's working? 
 Well, sure, things work for a while, but she's an adult. 
 I-I can't control her behavior, make her take her pills, behave appropriately. 
 You can support her, uh, which you are, and I think changing her medication might... 
 Dr. Murphy, I'm sorry, but you don't have a plan. 
 Unless you do. So what is it? 
 She's never getting better. 
 (voice breaking) I'm... I'm coming to terms with it, but people like you, who give me false hope, just make it worse. 
 She can improve. 
 And then? 
 There'll be another disaster. 
 I'm just happy that the police didn't have to bring her in this time. 
 (Heather inhales deeply) 
 Honey. Aah! (gasps) 
 (inhales deeply) 
 How are you feeling, huh? 
 Dr. Too tall. He stabbed me in the arm. 
 This whole thing is a bad situation. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 What is it? Was there a complication? 
 Not from the surgery. It's his face. 
 (Chester grunting) 
 Ohh. Ohh. Hey. 
 Get your test results back? (button clicks) 
 Okay, Chester, were you in the sun the entire time the medics were working on you? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yes, I was, and this is what happens, doc. 
 I don't, uh, I don't burn. I-I bubble up. 
 Either the ozone layer's completely disappeared, or you are a vampire. 
 (strained voice) Yeah, you got that right, pal. 
 Eternal life of agony. 
 Lupus. 
 Ohh. Come on, Dr. Reid. 
 Photosensitivity is a telltale symptom. 
 So is pain. Abdominal pain. 
 Yeah. I've been tested. 
 So let's test you again. 
 Ohh. (sighs) 
 Yeah. Fine. I want something in return. 
 What? 
 Find the great Randall. Bring him down here again. 
 Have him send me back to oblivion. 
 Chester, it... it's not a solution. 
 No? What is? 
 (curtain rings rattle) 
 (muffled voice) Aah. Ow! 
 Aah! Aah, aah, aah! 
 (normal voice) Ow. 
 (laughs) did you just bite me? 
 Yeah. I had an impulse. 
 Ohh. Okay. 
 Okay. Are you mad at me? Did I do something? 
 You brought Dr. Reid in on a surgery that you promised me, and you never call me unless you want to have s*x. 
 Well, I thought that was the deal... 
 Uh, for both us. 
 We're h... we're having fun, right? 
 But not more. 
 Are we having "the talk"? 
 No. No. 
 Because I've been completely honest with you here, Maggie, about this. 
 I... (sighs) I'm not up for a relationship right now. 
 I don't have it in me, and I don't want to lead you on. 
 (sighs) Okay. 
 Then I think our transaction is done, Dr. Goran. 
 I'm sorry. Our what? (chuckles) 
 I've had a great time, it's been super fun, you're a really smart guy and you're good company. 
 I'll-I'll see you around the hospital. 
 I am not shaking your hand. 
 Joel, it's been fun. Let's just shake and be friends. 
 (curtain rings rattle) 
 My whole life I've been haunted by spooks like you. 
 The only way I escape is getting high or drunk. 
 Okay, well, before you do that, could you please get a message to Alex for me? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 I don't understand. What do you have to lose? 
 Do you think having this curse is fun? 
 People think I'm nuts. 
 Or worse... they believe me and then they're hounding me, trying to get in touch with uncle Arthur or little Bobby or... 
 I have to be very, very careful who I, uh... 
 I'm not exactly in the most normal circumstances here myself. 
 You're half in, half out. 
 What? What'd you say? 
 You haven't fully accepted what you're going through. 
 I can tell. 
 Morning. Can I get a coffee? 
 There she is. 
 (cash register beeps) 
 Oh, Dr. Reid. Small world. 
 Would you please just... just-just talk to her? 
 For me? 
 (sighs) Why should I? 
 Because you're a decent man. 
 Dr. Reid. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Is there something with our coffee? 
 People don't normally hang out in the hospital. 
 Could I talk to you for a second? 
 Okay. 
 I, um... 
 How's Chester? 
 He's recovering. 
 Tell her you're talking to Charlie. She'll believe you. 
 (cash register beeps) 
 What's going on? 
 You're gonna find this a bit weird. 
 Um, I was on my way out. 
 You're gonna think I'm nuts, but I started picking up on a spirit. 
 Name's Charlie. 
 Who told you about Charlie? 
 He did, and he won't shut up. 
 Charlie's here right now? Okay. 
 Uh, where? Where? Where is he? 
 I'm right beside you. 
 Tell her I'm-I'm... I'm glad she's wearing the necklace I bought for her last birthday. 
 Is this some kind of a joke? 
 He's glad you're wearing the necklace he got you for your last birthday. 
 How did you know that? 
 He's here. He's listening. 
 (sighs) 
 You're lying. 
 Why would I lie? Huh? 
 I don't know. 
 So you could think I'm crazy? Uh... 
 If you don't believe me, go. 
 Go! 
 Fine. 
 What if I am telling the truth, though? 
 Huh? 
 Listen to me. He's right there. 
 Charlie. 
 (sighs) 
 Alex. 
 If you're there... 
 I need you to wake up. 
 Oh, god. I know, baby. 
 I know. I'm-I'm trying. I'm trying. 
 Tell her I'm... tell her I'm trying. 
 Tell her she needs to have faith. 
 Uh, tell her I'm here. Tell her I'm right here. 
 Tell her to believe in me. 
 Anything? 
 What are you waiting for? Tell her. 
 You get paid to do your job, eh, doc? 
 What are you doing? 
 You're not serious. 
 What? You-you called me here to wake up Chester. 
 Now you want me to talk to your boyfriend. 
 (scoffs) Wow. I'm an idiot. 
 She's gonna think you're hustling her. 
 What are you doing? No, all I'm saying is there's gotta be something in this for me. 
 You know what? I... 
 I believed you for-for just a minute. 
 No. No. No. What are you doing? 
 Oh. 
 Alex. 
 Alex! 
 Alex! 
 (pants) 
 Charlie... 
 What the hell were you thinking? 
 You were my one chance, my only chance. 
 It's gone now. 
 (grunts) 
 (clicking) 
 Just checking in. 
 Morphine's not working. 
 It'll only give you so much. 
 Why don't you get up and walk around a little? 
 Oh, like a little light jog or some. Uh, what... (grunts) cross-training? 
 Chester. 
 It might make you feel better, and after a surgery, you should. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Here we go. 
 Are you gonna walk with me? (sniffles) 
 Sure. 
 So is there anyone you should be calling? 
 Tell them you're here? You must have a girlfriend or something. 
 (chuckles) Ooh. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, she, uh, she left a while ago. 
 She couldn't take it. 
 She didn't think the pain was real. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 Yeah. I used to be, uh, a pretty happy-go-lucky guy. 
 You know what's hilarious? 
 Mm? 
 I used to be a salesman. 
 What did you sell? 
 Sold cars. (chuckles) Yeah. 
 But you really just sell yourself. That's what they say, and since my brand, you know, so to speak, kinda became, uh, became this, I, um... 
 I'm not really feeling that much better. 
 I think I'd like to go back and lie down. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 (sighs) 
 I just heard about your freaky patient. 
 Yeah. Abdominal pain, strange blood counts, blistering. 
 Blistering? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I told you, garlic and a holy water enema might do the trick. 
 He did have a stake going through his chest. 
 Just noticing a connection. 
 My patient is really suffering, Reycraft, and not just from photosensitivity. 
 The guy's a vampire. 
 Who's gonna tell him? 
 Joel : Guys. 
 Vampire. (elevator bell dings, doors open) 
 Jackson, I love you. 
 Joel, do you have five minutes to come to the lab and try something bizarre? 
 Okay. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 I shouldn't have come in. 
 Why not? The E.R.'s here for everybody. 
 You don't have to be bleeding out to ask for help. 
 Not that I know what I'm talking about because I'm crazy. 
 Heather, I told your mother I'd like to rejig your drug regimen, and I really think that you would benefit from talk therapy. 
 I talk all the time. It just makes me worse. 
 You have auditory hallucinations. 
 The hate voices? 
 "I'm sick of you. Why don't you die already?" 
 Do they ever abate? Are they ever quiet? 
 They-they can't be quiet. 
 They keep coming at me, and they just get smarter. 
 Talking to me can help give you perspective, but you have to stick to your meds. 
 I go off my meds because they make me feel closed in. 
 I know. 
 No, you don't. 
 My other world is scary, but I have friends there. 
 S-sometimes it's easier to live there than it is to live here. 
 Your neck. 
 That could be dystonia. 
 It's a reaction to the dopamine-blocking drugs that have built up in your system. 
 May I? 
 (chuckles) 
 How did you do that? 
 It's a sensory trick. It doesn't always work. 
 How did you do that? 
 (laughs) I don't know. 
 You have magic hands. 
 Just regular hands. 
 (chuckles) They're magic. 
 I can tell. 
 Why don't you stick around then? 
 Okay. (laughs) 
 Great. 
 Porphyria. 
 The vampire disease. 
 Yes. I've never seen it, but I did med school simulations. 
 And it's incredibly difficult to diagnose, because it mimics other diseases. 
 Was he tested for it? 
 Not that I can see, no. 
 Okay, we're good to go. Hit the lights. 
 Okay, so what exactly are we looking for here? 
 (switch clicks) If he has porphyria, his urine will turn neon pink under the black light. 
 If it doesn't, we're back to square one. 
 Disco pee. 
 Patient's porphyrin levels must be through the roof. 
 Chester has porphyria. I can't believe it. 
 Run a blood and urine test to confirm. 
 I have an answer for him. 
 In a nutshell, your body is overproducing something called a porphyrin. 
 Now these porphyrins are actually attacking your whole system... your nerves, your muscles, your skin. 
 And my gut. That's why I'm always in so much pain, yeah? 
 Yes. You say it comes and goes, right? 
 Yeah. Well, porphyria causes attacks, and some are worse than others. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 Without a doubt. I know what's wrong with you. 
 (sighs) 
 You have no idea how long I've waited to hear that. 
 We will set you up with a hematologist right away, and they're gonna go over everything that you need to do to prevent another attack. You need to stay out of the sun, cut out alcohol, avoid stress. 
 Okay. 
 It will be trial and error for a while. 
 Well, uh, what do you mean? 
 Just until you find the other things that trigger the attacks, and once you do, you'll be able to manage your disease. 
 But I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna manage it. 
 You're gonna... you're gonna cure it. 
 This is a lifelong condition. 
 There is no cure. 
 But... 
 Chester, this still is good news. 
 Yeah, a-a little... a little bit. 
 Thank you. 
 Chester... 
 No, mystery solved. 
 You did a really good job, Dr. Reid. 
 Thanks for trying... 
 Thanks for trying to help me. 
 Okay. 
 If you can name it, but you can't change it, is it really better to know? 
 I feel like I'm going crazy. 
 I'm going crazy. Take the damn test. 
 Don't! 
 Mel. 
 (sighs) 
 Alex, you know you wouldn't be alone, okay? 
 You'd have a lot of help. 
 I'm not worried about that. 
 This would be Charlie's baby. It would be a gift. 
 I'm not ambivalent about this at all. 
 Okay, so go pee. 
 What are you doing in there? 
 Alex? 
 Did you take the test? 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Dr. Reid, could I talk to you, please? 
 I'm busy doing my job. 
 Well, you can give me two minutes. 
 And why would I wanna do that? 
 'Cause I am offering to make amends here. 
 Amends. Really? How? 
 I'm offering to... to... to try again, you know? 
 To be the messenger. 
 Free of charge. 
 You're unbelievable. 
 He's walking around here. 
 He's pining for you. 
 Only a very lonely man would prey on the vulnerabilities of another person the way you do, so I am trying not to judge you too harshly. 
 Good-bye. 
 Ugh. 
 Heather has agreed to try a new medication... 
 Risperidone. 
 Risperidone. 
 Risperidone. 
 That's good. 
 And we're gonna meet weekly for talk therapy. 
 We're gonna work on coping with the content of your delusions. 
 Every week, mondays at 3: 00, right? 
 Right. 
 It's a good step. 
 It's a good step. 
 Can you stick with it, Heather? 
 You need to stick with it. 
 Yeah, I can do it. Even if I can't change what I'm thinking, I can at least get more perspective. 
 And then maybe I can get a job and... 
 Her long-term goal is to move out. 
 Yeah. 
 I can cook you dinner for once. 
 Thanks, Dr. Murphy. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 I'll see you Monday, right, Heather? 
 Monday. Monday. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I think we're out of coffee. 
 Are we? 
 Yeah. I can stop and get some if you want. 
 You're a bear without your coffee. 
 (chuckles) 
 (telephones ringing, indistinct conversations) 
 Let me ask you something. 
 What do women want? 
 I don't get the question. 
 I mean, what is it with you people? 
 I-I thought it was honesty, so I try and give her honesty. 
 And still, I'm coming off like a total jerk. 
 Well, honesty isn't everything. 
 I assume we're talking about Maggie. 
 Yes. 
 Well,  were  you a jerk? 
 No. Absolutely not. 
 All right, so maybe I was a bit of a jerk. 
 Joel. 
 I can't give her more than I'm giving her, you know? 
 I was trying to be honest about that. 
 I'm just... I'm running blind here. 
 Just a human male, you know? 
 You're the most human male I know. 
 All right, now you're just messing with me. 
 So how was your day? 
 Mm. Well, I'm so desperate to get Charlie back that I had a conversation with him through a psychic. 
 Ah. The great Randall. 
 Yeah. He told me that, uh, Charlie got me this necklace for my birthday, so... 
 He probably just saw you touch it and made a guess. 
 Anyway, I'm an idiot. That's my day. 
 You're not a jerk, Joel. 
 But if you wanna be really honest, you can give a lot more than you're admitting. 
 You're just a chicken. 
 I'll see you. 
 (monitor beeping steadily, ventilator whooshing) 
 I took the test. 
 Got the results. 
 I'm not pregnant. 
 (crying) 
 I'm just saying that you're... you're lucky 'cause you had brothers. 
 Oh. (laughs) 
 You wouldn't be saying that if you had seen the bruises I had as a kid. 
 Yeah, but you had stories, you know? 
 Like, what, that time Dougie pushed you off the roof, right? 
 I jumped off the roof on a dare. 
 See? 
 Why don't you talk about when you were a kid? 
 Oh, gee, I don't know. 'Cause it wasn't fun? 
 Well, I wanna know more about you than just the fun things or the admirable things. 
 Well, I say we go in the back room, and we roll the dice... and we make a kid. 
 Okay. Wait. I'm all for going in the other room, but... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We are not rolling any dice. 
 Why not? 
 We don't have time for a baby. 
 With the hours I keep? 
 Yeah, but you could take a year off and... 
 Uh... 
 Come back. 
 Like that ever happens. 
 My career is really important to me right now, Charlie. 
 Okay. 
 (whispers) Okay. 
 But I know you, and you're gonna change your mind someday. 
 Someday? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And when you do, you're gonna wanna have six kids. 
 Oh? 
 And you'll want to name them all after me. (laughs) 
 Like, um... Charlie Jr. 
 Chuck. Chas. 
 Charlene. 
 "Crazy"? 
 (sighs) 
 (telephone ringing in distance) 
 (woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.) 
 There you are. 
 Got you a coffee. 
 Why? 
 It's time for me to try and be more generous. 
 Well, then thank you. Oh, okay. 
 It's time for me to try and be more generous with  you. 
 Is that code for you wanna be exclusive? 
 I think we should give a shot? 
 Huh. And you're talking boyfriend/girlfriend, right? 
 Not-not coffee? 
 Not coffee. 
 Huh. I'm open to it. 
 But I wanna hear you say "boyfriend" before I believe you. 
 Boyfriend. 
 I would very much like to try and be your boyfriend. 
 Hmm. Cheesy. 
 (William Fitzsimmons' "beautiful girl" playing) 
 There's a difference between pain and suffering. 
 See, pain is in the body. 
 Suffering is in the mind, and it feels infinite. 
 So maybe the key is to feel your pain... 
 And learn from it. 
 And someday... Your suffering might disappear.
