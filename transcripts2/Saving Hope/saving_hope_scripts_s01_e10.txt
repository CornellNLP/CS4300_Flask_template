 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Charlie's initial M.R.I. showed signs of a diffuse axonal injury. 
 His latest M.R.I. shows... complete resolution, and all the swelling has resolved, as have all of the contusions. 
 His brain is now slack. 
 To tearing, no inflammation, no sign of D.A.I. 
 Why isn't he waking up? 
 That is the mystery, Alex. 
 There's something we're not seeing. 
 And the last time you checked, did you find anything else in his medical records? 
 Think. Come on. 
 Chicken pox when he was 9, and he dislocated his shoulder playing football in university. 
 I know. I know. I know any history of concussions? 
 (sighs) No. I mean, none that would have brought him to the hospital, anyway. 
 One step forward. Two steps back. 
 Come on, guys. What are we missing here? 
 Alex. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Huh? 
 The fact that Charlie's breathing on his own... that's monumental. 
 That's great news. 
 I know. I'm just... (laughs) I'm impatient, you know? 
 I... I'm happy he's come this far. 
 No, don't do that. Don't... don't do that, Alex. 
 Don't settle. Don't be happy with just this. 
 Hey, Charlie. 
 You're looking more like your old self, Charlie. 
 Every day is one step closer to bringing you back to me. 
 I've got rounds. 
 I love you, handsome. (kisses) 
 And I love you. 
 (knock on door) Yep. 
 Hope I'm not interrupting anything. 
 No, Bryan, come on in. 
 Please. 
 Sit down. 
 How's everything going? 
 Really well. I was just going over the quarterly reports, Well, that's what we like to hear. 
 I assume you heard about Charlie. 
 What, breathing on his own? Wonderful news. 
 Really, for him and for Dr. Reid. 
 Still, the chances of Charlie resuming his role of chief of surgery are slim, and the board has decided that Hope Zion doesn't need an interim chief of surgery. We need an actual replacement. 
 I see. Mm-hmm. 
 We're opening the position up across the country, and I'd like you to have your name in the mix. 
 In the mix. 
 Can I ask, is that just a formality? 
 Ah. It's just a process. 
 Anyway, posting's going up later today, and we look forward to receiving your application. 
 I'll let you get back to it. Dana, I know you're very busy. 
 Thank you. 
 (door opens) 
 Thank you. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Okay, hit me. What's next? 
 Uh, well, let's go in order of stupidity, okay? 
 We have a teenage girl who swallowed so much pool water, she's vomiting blood, A water skier who impaled himself on a tree branch, and last but not least, a 300-pound man with impacted stool due to overconsumption of watermelon seeds. 
 You made that last one up, right? 
 You're right. He's probably 350 pounds. 
 Hmm. 
 Zach : What do you got, Joe? 
 Kendra Watt, 35-year-old female. She's been seizing. 
 Laceration to her forehead, bleeding profusely. 
 She's hypotensive, about 90 over 60, tachycardic, and jaundiced. 
 Maggie : I think that's Dr. Kendra from that TV show. 
 How'd she cut herself? 
 Sir, I found her like this when I went to pick her up this morning. 
 I'm her assistant, Kate. 
 How long ago was that? 
 Uh, maybe half an hour. 
 Okay. 
 Whoa! 
 That wound is superficial it shouldn't still be bleeding. 
 Any idea what happened? 
 Um... well... 
 You're not gonna get in trouble. Just say it. 
 You've seen the show, right? 
 Yeah, once or twice. 
 Well, Kendra's a very spiritual person, and last night she said she wanted to expand her mind. 
 So she took mushrooms. 
 Could be Amanita poisoning. 
 What's that? 
 Amanita Phalloides is also known as the death cap. 
 Easily mistaken for magic mushrooms. 
 Your boss is showing all the symptoms for fulminant liver failure. 
 All right, let's add in acetylcysteine and F.F.P. for the bleeding and whole blood. 
 Did you go on this trip with her, Kate? 
 No. No, no. Mushrooms aren't my thing. 
 So you're not gonna tell anybody about this, right? 
 Because Kendra will be majorly pissed if this comes out. 
 Like, pissed at me. 
 Do you have any mushrooms left? 
 I brought some just in case. 
 Great. Thanks. Find a myocologist so we can identify them. In the meantime, let's do blood work, C.B.C., coags, L.F.T.S, and ammonia levels, and, um, oh, you know what? Call the hepatologist and get him to contact the liver transplant team. 
 What? What, y-you have to do a liver transplant? 
 It may be the only way to save her life. 
 How is he? 
 He's good. I need to figure out why he's still under, but, uh, he's-he's great. 
 Good. 
 Uh... Look, Alex, I-I know you're disappointed about losing chief resident. 
 Well, I am. I can't lie. 
 But... 
 I hope you don't feel like I'm punishing you. 
 I don't. 
 The truth is, I can't give you what you need right now. 
 You made the hard call, and I accept it. 
 Okay. Well... Thank you for being so professional. 
 You're welcome. 
 But when Charlie is out of the woods, I'm gonna wanna revisit this. 
 And so you should, and... 
 I am really happy about Charlie. 
 Thank you. 
 Nothing's working, Dr. Miller. Her vitals are down. 
 She's hypotensive. 
 No, no, no. 
 No, doctor, she cannot die. 
 Woman : She's seizing. 
 Hepatic encephalopathy. 
 (monitor beeping erratically) 
 I got no pulse. All right, start C.P.R. 
 Give me an amp of epi, stat. And bag her. 
 Get the intubation equipment ready. 
 Saline's running. I.V.'s wide open. 
 Pause for rhythm check. 
 No pulse. 
 Pulseless electrical activity. All right, resuming C.P.R. 
 Give me an amp of atropine. 
 No one can see me. 
 None of you... can... see me. 
 Oh, my god. 
 This is amazing. 
 Boo! 
 Oh! So... uh, you  can  see me. 
 Yeah. 
 But why? 
 Is... This is my trip, and... why are you here, and why are you wearing a tuxedo? 
 Your-your trip? 
 I'm expanding my mind. 
 Ohh. 
 Oh, I wish this  was  your trip. 
 Okay. 
 That is... actually quite profound. 
 What? 
 Okay, gonna make the first incision longitudinally over the F.C.U. in the distal half of the forearm. 
 Then I'm going to to transect the F.C.U. tendon from the pisiform and detach it as far distally as I can. 
 Knife. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 (beeps) 
 Joel? Everything okay? 
 Uh... 
 Oh. 
 I can't do this. 
 Uh, my hand's cramping. I actually... 
 Uh, you're gonna have to find yourself another orthopod. 
 This is your surgery. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 Victor, will you call Dr. Simons? 
 Have him come to the O.R. 
 I'm on it. 
 (breathing heavily) 
 So how'd it go in there? 
 Surgery was successful. 
 Function fully restored to the wrist and thumb. 
 You were missed. 
 Yeah, well, the last thing I wanted to do was to operate on a patient with a compromised hand. 
 You know, Dana, I know I said I should come back to work, but I really think that I need to take a leave of absence. 
 Joel, it's okay. You just need to clear your head, take a little break. 
 What's your schedule like for the day? 
 Um, I had scheduled a knee arthroscopy and a hip replacement. 
 Oh, Simons can cover those. You're coming with me. 
 I'm coming with you where? 
 You ever heard of a little town called Elsinore? 
 I've read "Hamlet." 
 Ha ha. Different Elsinore. I grew up there. 
 I'm doing a C.M.E. 
 I don't know... 
 I do. 
 You need to clear your head, and I can use your help. 
 You go get a toothbrush, grab an extra shirt from your locker. 
 You meet me at my car in 30 minutes, okay? 
 Little road trip. It'll be fun. 
 So you're in a coma. 
 Yep, three months now, but my neurosurgeon says my brain is healing nicely, and I could wake up any day now. 
 What happened? 
 Car accident. 
 Oh. Limo driver? 
 Surgeon. Publicist? 
 I have two. 
 Hmm? 
 I'm a therapist. Might have seen my show. 
 Dr. Kendra. 
 Dr. Phil. Dr. Oz. Dr. Kendra. 
 So when you say you're a doctor... 
 I'm a licensed psychiatrist. 
 You don't just play one on TV? 
 That's  hilarious. 
 (Charlie laughs) 
 Uh, so... what now? 
 Oh, well, now I guess your brain readjusts and you stop seeing me. 
 Oh, so you've done this before... interacted with people... 
 Coma patients, dead people. 
 A psychic once. He was an ass. 
 Dead people? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. Well... You don't think that I'm... 
 I don't know. Uh, what's the last thing you remember? 
 I was... in my condo. 
 I'd just taken mushrooms. 
 Things got a bit unpleasant, and then I wound up here. 
 Unpleasant how? 
 I threw up a couple of times. 
 Why am I here? 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (child coughing in distance) 
 Tom, I just... uh, I wanted to say congratulations on becoming chief surgical resident. 
 Thank you. 
 Now I know this must be awkward for you because it's incredibly awkward for me, but I... 
 Why would it be awkward for me? 
 174. That makes it... 
 (gasps) A full 120 pounds gone forever. Buh-bye! 
 Congratulations, Doug. And I probably shouldn't say this, but you look hot. 
 Oh, please, stop. 
 No, actually, don't stop. Keep going. Tell me more. 
 (laughs) Dr. Reid, you have created a monster. 
 Yeah, well, I spent the first 28 years of my life sitting on my ass eating fast food and watching TV. 
 You've given me a new lease on life, Dr. Reid, and I'm, uh, I'm running with it. (cell phone vibrating) 
 Dougie, turn it off, please. Half an hour. 
 It's okay if you need to talk. 
 Oh, talk. Is that what the boys are doing on your little app? Are they talking? 
 It's like facebook for gays. 
 (chuckles) Except for instead of friending people, you... 
 Oh, yeah, okay. I... 
 It's a harmless ego boost. That's all. 
 Because hello... mission accomplished. 
 That's the best way to fall in love... with your best friend. 
 After he loses half his body weight, of course. 
 So, Doug, let's go over the rest of your test results. 
 Everything looks good. B12 levels are fine. 
 Cholesterol's normal. 
 Iron's a bit low, so we should work on getting that back up. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But other than that, if there's anything else... 
 Mm. 
 Okay. 
 Doug. 
 (sighs) She's not my G.P. She's my surgeon. 
 That's okay. What's up? 
 I was at the gym a couple weeks ago, on the pec deck, when my hand slipped, and the bar fell on my chest. 
 It doesn't hurt anymore, but it feels a little swollen on the left side. 
 Well, it's probably just soft tissue damage. 
 But just hop up on the table there. 
 You can take your shirt off, and I'll, uh, have a look. 
 Here we go. 
 (chuckles) 
 It is a little swollen. 
 Tender? 
 Mm. 
 Yeah? (clears throat) 
 Hmm. 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm just gonna check something out, and I will be right back. Hang tight. 
 I was doing a chest exam on a patient just now. 
 Kinky. 
 Not really. 
 He dropped a barbell on it a couple week. 
 Kinkier. 
 When I got to his nipple and pressed, there was red discharge. 
 Steroids. 
 Steroids? 
 Yep. Roids lead to gynecomastia, which can lead to nipple discharge. 
 Your patient's probably juicing. Thanks. 
 Yeah, she didn't make it. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Where are you going? 
 Uh, field trip with Kinney. 
 Field trip? 
 Mm-hmm. It's like a continuing medical education thing. 
 I'll be back tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow. Lucky you. 
 What, is that a problem? 
 Have you seen the posting? 
 They're looking for a new chief of surgery. 
 Yeah, we already have a chief of surgery. 
 We have an interim chief of surgery, so is Kinney going on a field trip, or is she looking for a new job? 
 Well,  that  would be gossip. 
 Man : ♪ I feel so good all the time ♪ 
 ♪ I need you here by my side ♪ 
 How long have you been doing this? 
 What, the C.M.E.S? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know. About ten years? 
 You know, it just gives the surgeons in these small towns a chance to update their skill sets, and... 
 That's cool. 
 Yeah. 
 Tell me something. Why is the hospital looking for a new chief of surgery? 
 The posting's up already, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, they're not looking for a new chief, necessarily. 
 I mean, I'm in the mix. 
 You're in the mix. 
 (laughs) Come on. 
 And, yeah, well, it's a big job, Joel. 
 Right, which you've been doing incredibly well at. 
 Now there's a process when you hire the chief of surgery. 
 I understand that there's a process. 
 It's called find the best person for the job. 
 How is that not you? I just... 
 Well... 
 I mean, with your experience and track record and performance it just feels, uh, it just feels wrong. 
 Well, it was never a done deal, all right? 
 So I apply, and hopefully I get it. 
 See, I never figured you were so gallant, Joel. 
 (chuckles) I'm not. 
 (chuckles) 
 Trust me, I'm not. 
 ♪ I feel so cruel ♪ 
♪ I need you here by my side ♪ 
♪ oh, honey, you make me feel so good ♪ 
♪ the love you feel ♪ 
♪ so good now ♪ 
♪ oh, if you... ♪ 
 (dog barking in distance) 
 So this is where you grew up. (car door closes) 
 (bells tolling) This is where I grew up. 
 Remind me to stock up on my quilts, fudge, and maple sugar while I'm here. 
 (laughs) Dana? 
 Stephanie? 
 I'm in shock. 
 I did not expect to run into you today. 
 Oh, my gosh! 
 Wow. 
 I thought you and John were out west. 
 Well, we were, but we moved back two years ago with the girls. 
 Oh, my god. 
 This is home again. 
 And I'm just overnight working. If I'd known you were here, I would have e-mailed. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Can you drop by for dinner, see the new place? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 Listen, I'll tell you what. As soon as I'm finished here, I'll give a call. We'll make a plan. 
 Okay, but you don't have my number. 
 Are you listed? 
 Of course I'm listed. 
 Fantastic. 
 Dr. Kinney. 
 So wonderful to finally meet you. 
 Oh, wonderful to meet you, too. I'm not Dr. Kinney. 
 This is, uh, Dana Kinney right here. 
 Better let you go. 
 Okay, bye. Bye-bye. 
 (chuckles) Uh, I am so sorry. 
 I-I presumed that... 
 That's fine. 
 It's one of those names... can be either/or. 
 So you ready for us to talk your ears off? 
 Only if you teach us how to sign them back on. 
 (laughs) 
 (siren wailing) 
 I've done drugs. I'm not gonna lie, but I have never taken steroids. 
 And a year ago, you didn't look like Chris Evans, either. 
 That's because I've been working out. 
 Dr. Reid, I swear I'm clean. 
 Okay, you need to respect that a gastric bypass isn't just a cosmetic procedure. 
 Steroids can cause cancer. 
 They can cause cardiovascular problems. 
 And shrunken gonads. 
 Yes. 
 Okay, I got it. Why are you even asking me this? 
 Because nipple discharge is a sign, and when I pressed on your chest, that's what happened. 
 So, please, let me run some more tests. 
 I'll figure out what's going on. 
 Okay. Sure. 
 My diagnosis is that he's suffering injury to his C5 and C6, possibly a nerve root avulsion. 
 That's a classic brachial plexus injury. 
 So how do you fix it? 
 Normally, I'd send him down to you in the big city. 
 Actually, he does have an appointment with us later this month. 
 Well, right now Craig is your case study, so... 
 Okay, well, depending on the damage, I'd graft the nerves. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Why wouldn't you transfer? 
 It's been proven to be more effective at restoring the strength. 
 Transfers can lead to complications. 
 Not if you do them right. 
 Actually, both methods work. If you were going to... 
 What would you do, Dr. Kinney? 
 I would use the spinal accessory nerve to graft the C5 and C6 nerve roots, and then I'd perform a F.C.U. to the E.C.R.B. transfer to address the loss of wrist dorsiflexion. 
 As a matter of fact, I've just published a paper on this in the "journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery" if you'd like to read up on the procedure. 
 All right, Dr. Carson, so let's talk about how we do a nerve graft. 
 I'm dead. 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry. 
 You guys can take her down to the morgue. 
 I know I should be handling this better, but... I'm not. 
 Yeah, so we're gonna have to send out a press release. 
 Uh, "Dr. Kendra Watts, expert in her field," 
 "died at age..." 
 35. I'm 35. 
 (laughs) I know. She's not like a real doctor, but it's a press release, so she can't come off like a hack. 
 A hack? 
 A hack?! I am not a hack! 
 Whoa, calm down, calm down. 
 I have a degree. I have  two  degrees. 
 I-I know. I get that. 
 That ungrateful little... 
 I know. 
 She didn't even know how to use a fax machine. 
 She can't hear you. 
 So let it go. 
 She didn't know what a latte was. 
 Let it go. Let it go. 
 Let it  go. 
 Go. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Whoa. 
 When I wake up in, like, 12 hours from now, and I'm done this trip... 
 You're not gonna wake up, Kendra. 
 Sorry. 
 So... what now? 
 Uh, now you move on to whatever happens next, but if you're sticking around, and it kinda looks like you are, it's usually for a reason. 
 What kind of reason? 
 Well, you took mushrooms. 
 Oh, god. Shrooms. 
 Oh! My god. What an idiot I am. 
 Who am I? Some undergrad who just read William Burroughs for the first time? 
 God, I could die of embarrassment if I wasn't already dead. 
 Why'd you take them, Kendra? 
 Because we just shot the hundredth episode of my TV show, and you know what the topic was? 
 No. 
 Celebrity baby names. 
 Okay. 
 Celebrity baby names. I am a serious therapist. 
 I got into this business to help people, you know? 
 To help elicit real change, and then suddenly, I'm doing a show about celebrity baby names. 
 So I just thought, you know, I need to get out of myself and gain perspective and focus again on what's real and then suddenly, I'm dead. 
 And now I'm a bigger joke dead than I was alive. 
 (sighs) 
 So... why are you here? 
 Not sure I understand the question. 
 Well, you are stuck here and not in your body. Why? 
 Uh... traumatic brain injury. 
 But you said you were healing. 
 I am, but there's something the doctors are missing. 
 Perhaps there's something... unresolved? 
 You rotate the flap over and suture the z-plasty into place. 
 You wanna give that a try? 
 Okay. 
 Do you want a coffee? 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 Dr. Kinney, thank you for coming out today. 
 Oh, my pleasure. You've got a fine group of surgeons. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I ask you something, though? 
 Of course. 
 Why do you only have one woman on your staff? 
 I mean, women make up more than half the medical students in this country... 
 Look, Dana, I would love to hire more women if I could, but the fact is, do you have any idea how difficult it is for me to recruit to a rural hospital? 
 Why? 
 And women doctors eventually start families. 
 That's the reality, and then they don't come back to work. 
 I have two children. 
 Well, then you're the exception, aren't you? 
 Look, I'm not saying it's not fair... 
 It's more than unfair. It's discrimination. 
 Well, interpret it however you want. 
 Fact is, when I hire a surgeon, I wanna keep that surgeon. 
 You work in a very different world, Dr. Kinney. 
 Actually, no, I don't. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 (sighs) Dr. McBride here. 
 Oh, hey, Christy. What's up? 
 No, I'm not at the hospital. 
 What? 
 Okay, I'll be right there. Did you call 9-1-1? 
 Good. Okay. Bye-bye. 
 What's up? 
 Hey, is everything okay? 
 Uh, an accident downtown. A truck hit a pedestrian. 
 Do you want our help? 
 Uh, yeah, come on. 
 Oh, thank god, Ronnie. She's trapped under there. 
 (gasping) 
 (whispers) Stephanie. 
 (crying) 
 Stephanie. Stephanie, can you hear me? 
 Squeeze my hand if you can hear me. 
 Okay, good. Don't try and talk. 
 You're gonna lie still. It's okay. 
 We're gonna get you out of here. 
 Okay, multiple polytrauma to her face, her legs. 
 No external bleeding. 
 Truck must be acting as a tourniquet, Preventing her from bleeding out. 
 How much does this thing weigh? 
 10 tons, at least. Too heavy to lift hydraulically. 
 And we can't drag it off her, not with her underneath it. 
 We need a crane, something to lift it. 
 She's losing her airway. We have to crike her. 
 Ambulance is at least 15 minutes away over in Springmount. 
 15 minutes? We don't have 15 minutes. 
 Okay, I need a first aid kit and an oxygen tank. 
 I've got a first aid kit. 
 Her face is fractured. 
 She'll have teeth and debris in the back of her throat. 
 We're gonna have to go in below. 
 Needle crike? I've never done one. 
 Neither have I, not on a real patient. 
 Joel, I still need that first aid kit. 
 Do you have a first aid kit in there, please? 
 It's okay. It's gonna be okay. 
 Okay. 
 All right. How's that leg? 
 Well, I can't see all of it. 
 It's a partial traumatic amputation, open femur fracture. 
 She's degloved. 
 Here. 
 Okay, that's perfect. 
 We're gonna do this fast and dirty. 
 Cover and uncover. 
 (click) 
 Oxygen goes into her chest, comes out here. 
 Syringe. 
 Steph? It's gonna help you breathe, okay? 
 There. (whimpering) 
 Okay. Hold steady. 
 Attach the tubing to the needle. 
 (crying) 
 Open it to 15 liters per minute. 
 Okay, we just bought her 20 minutes. 
 Where is she? Mom! 
 It's okay. Come here. 
 No! 
 Mom! 
 You need to stay back. You need to stay back. 
 Okay. 
 Emma, it's okay. 
 Joel : It's okay. 
 
 
 
 Doug, your ultrasound results came back in from the imaging. 
 It looks like the pain and swelling in your chest may be a tumor... Breast cancer. 
 Breast cancer? I'm a guy. 
 Men can get breast cancer, too. 
 It's rare, but if you have a family history, or if you're overweight. 
 (sighs) So this is god's way of punishing me for being fat? 
 No, are-are you sure, Dr. Reid? This couldn't be something else? 
 The only way to know for sure is to do a biopsy. 
 It's simple. I stick a needle in, get a sample, then I take it to the lab and they test it for cancer cells. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 So, first things first. I'm gonna numb the area. 
 Ready? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Needle and ultrasound, please. 
 Got it. Great. 
 You might wanna look away. 
 Mm. You're gonna hear a little pop as the needle removes the sample. 
 (click, ultrasound whooshing) 
 There you go. All done. 
 Just put a rush on the sample, okay? 
 Why? 
 Breast cancer's found late in men because nobody's looking for it. 
 So the faster we deal with this, the better. 
 Okay. 
 It won't be long. 
 This is not some after school job at McDonald's. 
 You cannot show up late for your shift. Hey! 
 Not even five minutes. Understood? 
 Go. 
 (sighs) 
 Hey, Reycraft. 
 Listen, I know it's frustrating when doctors are late for work, but next time, just take him to task in private. 
 Alex. 
 Yeah. 
 You're no longer chief surgical resident. 
 I know that. 
 Good, then I hope you won't feel the need to tell me how to do my job. 
 (sighs) Wouldn't dream of it. 
 Kendra, I appreciate that you're trying to help, but the whole unresolved thing is usually reserved for the dead, not the living. 
 Oh, yeah, 'cause you seem really alive right now. 
 I'm guessing you haven't been in therapy before. 
 No, I'm a surgeon, and we tend to like to fix things and not talk about them. 
 Well, I'm a therapist, and we like to fix things  by  talking about them. 
 (singsongy) Don't be scared. 
 I'm not scared. 
 Okay. So all we're gonna do is talk and try to figure out if there's anything keeping you here other than your physical injuries. 
 Is that right? 
 Sure. Yeah. 
 Okay. Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 What is your biggest regret? 
 I don't believe in regrets. I have made mistakes. 
 Okay. So what's your biggest mistake? 
 I... married the wrong woman. 
 Mm. 
 But I fixed that. I found the right one. 
 And is she waiting for you? 
 Yes, she is. 
 So you have everything to live for in the physical plane. 
 Yes. 
 But you're stuck here. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Why? 
 Traumatic brain injury. 
 Charlie, you have gotta stop thinking like a surgeon. 
 Expand your mind. 
 Dig deeper. 
 I'm sorry. I just... I'm not used to thinking that way. 
 I just... Not easy. 
 We're gonna try something a little different. 
 Have you ever heard of bioenergetics? 
 No. 
 Well, lucky for you, I have. 
 It's a body-based therapy designed to help connect your mind to your body. 
 Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Why are you stuck here? 
 What are you doing? 
 Why are you stuck here? 
 Uh, because I'm not a neurologist. 
 It's not my area of expertise. 
 That is not an answer. If you don't wake up, what happens? 
 Uh, I guess I stay here until my body dies. 
 Okay. And how does that make you feel? 
 Uh, Kendra... 
 Come on, Charlie. 
 Come on. Say it. 
 Like, this isn't a life. Like I... like-like I... 
 Um, uh, I can't do anything. I can't even... I can't, uh, I can't even change these clothes. 
 Okay, then how does that make you feel? 
 Scared, okay?! Angry! 
 Terrified! 
 Like I've been cheated. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, like it's a big cosmic joke. 
 So why won't you wake up? 
 Because I have a traumatic brain injury. 
 That is not an answer! Why won't you wake up?! 
 Because. 
 Because why? 
 Because. 
 Tell me why. 
 Because... 
 Come on. Just say it. 
 You're on the verge of saying it. 
 Why won't you wake up? 
 Because I don't wanna wake up! 
 Makes no sense. 
 It's okay. It's a feeling. It doesn't have to make sense. 
 But, Charlie, some part of you is keeping you here, and we need to figure out why. 
 Is it easier to stay here? Charlie. 
 Charlie. 
 I don't know. 
 You do know. This is your feeling. 
 Charlie, come on. Stay with me. Look at me. 
 Charlie, look at me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This isn't getting me anywhere. 
 What about that new hockey arena they're building over in Paisley? 
 They're using a crane for that? 
 I've got a woman pinned under a damn tow truck. 
 Yes, it's important! 
 Mom? Hello? 
 It's okay. 
 Hello? 
 It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. 
 She's losing consciousness. (crying) 
 Shock? 
 Heart's racing. 
 She wasn't before. Give me the tubes. 
 (siren wails) 
 (crying) 
 80 palpitations. 
 Ohh. 
 She's bleeding out. 
 From where? Not her leg. 
 Lungs are clear. It's gotta be in the belly. 
 (crying) 
 I mean, an S.G.A. bleed? Broken pelvis. 
 I'm not gonna know anything till we get to the O.R. 
 (whispers) She's dying. 
 Ronnie, talk to me. 
 Great. Thanks. We've got a crane, but it's gonna take 45 minutes to an hour... 
 Forty... 
 That's too long. 
 I'm sorry. What can I tell you? It's the best we've got. 
 We need to cut her out. 
 You wanna amputate in the field? 
 I don't want to, but unless we get her out from under there, in the next 15 minutes, she's gonna die. 
 (siren wailing) 
 (sobbing) 
 You wanna amputate her leg with a scalpel, and you expect me to get behind that plan? No way. 
 What's your backup? What's your "B" plan? 
 I say we keep giving her ringers until we get the crane set up! 
 We can't, 'cause she's bleeding out too fast... We... why don't we try?! 
 For us to support her.  
 Cut off her leg? 
 Because, listen, Ron, it's basic medicine. 
 She bleeds out, and she dies. 
 Okay, she's not... she's not. 
 Okay, listen. 
 We save her leg! 
 What do you want her to do? What? 
 Listen to me. 
 Look, I'm not one to back away from a challenge. 
 But you know me. What you're proposing is potentially fatal. 
 It's okay. 
 (continues crying) 
 All right, then that's on me. 
 I am making this call. 
 We are doing this. 
 I've known Stephanie my entire life, and I am not gonna let her bleed out from the street. 
 (siren whoops) 
 We need to tourniquet that leg. 
 Get me some clean towels and disinfectant. 
 This is insane. 
 It's the plan. 
 It's gonna be a guillotine operation. 
 I'll dissect right down to the bone. 
 Joel, I need you to get control of all the bleeders. 
 Ronnie, you need to get them out of here. 
 No, I'm not leaving her. 
 Okay, shh, shh, shh. 
 She's out. Airway's secured. 
 It's running wide open. Betadine. 
 Tourniquet applied. 
 Scalpel. 
 Two fingers from the patella. Fishmouth incision. 
 Get those clips ready. They're gonna be a lot of blood. 
 Doug. 
 Where's Richard? 
 I don't know. 
 Do you wanna wait for him? 
 It's not going to be good news, is it? 
 (sighs) The biopsy results came back positive for ductal infiltrating carcinoma, which is the most common type of male breast cancer. 
 Lucky me. 
 You know, ductal means that the cancer originated in the ducts of the breast. 
 And your tumor is almost 5 centimeters, which is large. 
 There is also a chance That it has infiltrated the muscle wall, which means I'll have to remove some lymph nodes to see if the cancer is metastatic. 
 And if it is? 
 Chemo. 
 Radiation. But first, we need to perform a mastectomy. 
 And then I'll get a breast implant. 
 You gotta take me from an "A" cup to a "D"? 
 I realize that this is a lot to take in right now... 
 No, this is ridiculous! 
 Richard and I were friends for ten years before we hooked up. 
 It took 10 years and a 120 pounds. 
 Then he finally saw me in that way. 
 And now you want to mutilate me. 
 Doug, I really think that you... 
 He will leave me, Dr. Reid. 
 Maybe not right away, but he will. 
 Okay, we're down to the femur. 
 Joel, how do we get through that bone? 
 Saw's on its way from the hospital. 
 On its way? 
 Yeah. They say it's gonna be here in ten minutes. 
 I am not losing my patient because of a damn saw. 
 Joel, you're the orthopod. Find something else. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Knife. 
 Those are bolt cutters. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. Let's do this. 
 Okay, hit me with the betadine. 
 Now there's something you don't see every day. 
 (whispers) Okay. (clank) 
 Okay, I'm holding 'em back. 
 (sighs) 
 Joel. 
 Yeah. Whatever's going through your head right now, you just let it go. 
 All right, you breathe in. Breathe out. Make the cut. 
 (inhales deeply) 
 (clank) 
 (exhales deeply) 
 (crunch) 
 (exhales deeply) 
 (exhales deeply) 
 Get her to the ambulance. 
 Don't worry about the stump, Ron. 
 Find the source of bleeding and stop it, right? 
 Do you need us in the O.R.? 
 I've got it. Dr. Kinney? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, just go. 
 Will do. 
 That's great. Thank you, Ronnie. (darts thudding) 
 Okay, I'll call back later. Okay. 
 Good news? 
 Great news. She's gonna be okay. 
 Oh, that's amazing. 
 Yeah. Ohh. (laughs) 
 What? What are you laughing at? 
 You know, I was just thinking about how I brought you here... (dart thuds) to relax and clear your head. 
 Yes, head cleared. 
 No kidding. (thud) 
 (sighs) 
 We cut off a woman's leg with a scalpel and bolt cutters. 
 I need about nine more drinks. 
 It's the most insane thing I've ever done. 
 I don't believe that for a minute. 
 ♪ 
 (thud) 
 So today in the O.R. 
 What's going on there, huh? 
 (thud) Just went back to surgery too soon. 
 Come on. It wasn't about your hand. Your hand was fine. 
 You just couldn't make the cut. 
 (thud) And that's okay. 
 'Cause you just saw a guy shoot himself. 
 Sometimes it takes a while to recover from that. 
 (whispers) Yeah. 
 But when you needed to come through today, boy, did you ever. 
 Oh, I wasn't the only one. 
 Man, you were large and in charge out there. 
 I couldn't believe the way you castrated that poor Ronnie guy. 
 You know what? That, what you just said... 
 That's the whole problem. 
 What? 
 I didn't castrate anyone. Right? (thud) 
 I did my job. 
 Yes, you did. 
 As soon as a woman exerts a little power, she's a ball breaker. (thud) 
 What's that rumor around Hope Zee? 
 That I have a  pee  really? 
 I've never said... 
 Are you kidding? 
 I mean, so when men aren't ignoring us, they're demonizing us. 
 Okay, I think you're being a little... 
 I've known Stephanie since I was 7. 
 Right? 7. And she's lying there, bleeding to death on the street, and no one's willing to make a tough call except me. 
 And all I'm thinking about when I'm cutting off her leg is I said I'd call her today, but I probably wouldn't have. 
 I'm not a good friend... or a good mother. 
 I'm not even a good person half the time. 
 You saved her life. 
 I know. 
 I'm a good surgeon. 
 What I saw out there today... it wasn't surgery. 
 It was inspired. 
 You don't have to say this, Joel. 
 No. It was insane, it was dangerous, And it was monumentally sexy. 
 (chuckles) 
 Shut up. 
 I think you're kind of amazing, Dana. 
 You're amazing. 
 You should probably acknowledge it to yourself sometime. 
 ♪ 
 (panting) 
 (gasps) No. 
 (whispers) Give it to me. 
 (beeps) 
 Hey, I wanna thank... 
 Joel... 
 Sorry. 
 No, no. 
 No, you go first. 
 Go ahead. 
 No, I was just gonna, you know... 
 All right, all I... 
 I was just gonna say that, um... well, that last night was... was great, and... 
 It was great. 
 Yeah. 
 Just... 
 Yeah, really good. 
 And, uh... (inhales deeply) but, you know, it was last night. 
 It was last night, and... and today's... today. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Okay. So you're okay with that. 
 I'm totally okay. 
 Good. 
 I just didn't want you to feel... 
 I mean, embarrassed about it or... 
 What? No. No, not at all. Not at all. No. You know? 
 Well, that's... 
 And thank you for everything... this trip, everything. 
 No. Thank  you. 
 For what? 
 Good morning. 
 Dr. Reid. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Groggy. 
 It'll pass. 
 Time for me to check the incision, okay? 
 Just gonna move your arm out. 
 Mm. 
 Is that all right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 No. I don't want him to see it. 
 Okay. 
 Why? You think I'm gonna leave you? 
 I don't want you to pity me. 
 I don't. 
 I love you. 
 (sniffles) 
 Here we go. 
 The incision looks good. 
 No sign of infection. 
 I'll be back to check on you. Just rest. 
 (whispers) Thank you. 
 It's okay. 
 I love you. 
 Let me guess. Surgical lube? 
 In both my shoes. 
 Well, they hate me. 
 No, they just... 
 Do you want the truth? 
 Sure. 
 You're their boss. 
 And you're laying that on a little heavy. 
 Mm. 
 So I should be nicer. 
 Yes. 
 I mean, they're still gonna hate you sometimes, but... 
 That's why you're so relaxed, huh? 
 Partly. It's lonely at the top. 
 But if you wanna buy me a coffee, I might impart all of my chief resident wisdom to you. 
 Does that mean you don't want the job back? 
 I didn't say that. 
 (door closes) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How was your field trip? 
 I cut off a woman's leg with a pair of bolt cutters. 
 Huh. Liar. 
 See ya. 
 Ah, there she is. 
 So where's that application? Job posting's up. 
 I'm not applying. 
 Sorry? 
 (chuckles) I'm not submitting an application for a job I'm already doing... and doing extremely well. 
 Uh, Dana, there's a process. 
 Right. And this is mine. I've worked my ass off for the past 15 years at this hospital, the past three months as interim chief of surgery. 
 That's my application. 
 That's my process. 
 And if that doesn't work for you, good luck finding someone to replace me. 
 And  that's  that. 
 Yeah. I'm sorry, Kendra. 
 Wow. 
 This sucks. 
 I'm not even gonna try to be philosophical about it. 
 So you ready to move on, or... 
 Actually, no, I have some unresolved business I need to attend to. 
 (sighs) 
 Charlie. (groans) 
 Come  on. 
 Please? 
 Oh, god. You want me to jump up on the slab? 
 If that makes you more comfortable. 
 (sighs) 
 Charlie. 
 Hmm? 
 Why don't you wanna wake up? 
 (sighs) You know, that's the thing. 
 'Cause I want that more than anything. 
 So then what's stopping you? 
 What are you afraid of? 
 What's the source of all this pain? 
 I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. 
 You're not gonna lose me. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 You can't promise that. 
 Nobody can promise that. 
 Fine. 
 You're older than me. 
 You'll die before I do. 
 (laughs) 
 That make you feel better? 
 Yes, it does. Thank you. 
 I'll pine for you. 
 (laughs) 
 You know my parents died when I was 6, right? 
 It was a car accident. 
 They, um... they came into my room... and they put me to bed... and they kissed me good night. 
 And then my aunt came in the next morning and... she told me that they were gone. 
 But after that, I shut down. 
 I didn't say one word to anybody for a whole year. 
 Charlie, your heart is pounding. 
 I am not going anywhere. 
 Charlie, I am not a neurologist. 
 I don't know how comas work, but I do know how the human mind works. 
 This is your mind's home turf. 
 If it doesn't want you to wake up, then you need to fight it, and you need to figure out why, and once you get the answer to that question, you're gonna be one giant step closer to going home. 
 How do I do that? 
 You gotta... open up. 
 Be brave. 
 Look at the parts of you that you've hidden in order to protect yourself. 
 You're no hack, Kendra. 
 Really? 
 (sucks teeth) Yeah. 
 Yeah. You helped me.

 Thank you, Charlie. 
 You helped me, too.
