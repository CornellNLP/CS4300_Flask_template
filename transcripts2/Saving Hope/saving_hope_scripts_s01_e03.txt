 Alex : I know you're in there, Charlie. 
 I'm gonna get you back, and since patience has never been my strong suit... 
 (sighs) 
 Coma arousal therapy.

 I'm gonna stimulate your senses, baby. 
 Smell... 
 (spritzing) 
 Oh, no, not the perfume. 
 You're killing me.

 Touch. 
 Wow. Whoever invented this therapy is an evil  evil  genius. 
 (chuckles) 
 I feel ridiculous. 
 Don't stop. You feel amazing. 
 (doors slide open) 
 Dr. Reid? 
 Jackson! 
 Sorry. 
 No. Wait. 
 I... no, wait. I'm just, you know, I'm... 
 I'm doing this thing called coma arousal therapy. 
 His finger moved, so... 
 Yeah. I need to suction his phlegm. 
 Of course. Right. (clears throat) 
 (sighs) 
 Yeah, excuse me. 
 Charlie : You're not going to die. 
 You're going to get better. (telephone ringing in distance) (click) I tell my patients you have to believe that. At least you have to try. It's like one of those bets you make with yourself. If I can get all the way to the ground floor (whispers) Yes! Maggie : Wouldn't believe it, but this place has the best cappuccinos in town. Would this be considered a walk of shame? I think technically 'cause we're still together, we're pretty safe. (door creaks close) I'm guessing you're a bit of an expert. Maggie. Joel. I had a great time, really. Yeah. But... No "buts." It was fun. Gavin : Maggie! (under breath) Oh. Oh, crap. Act cool. (normal voice) Hey. (laughs) I didn't know you knew about this place. What? Are you kidding? The cappuccinos.  Hello. Wow. Psychiatry. Wish I had time for a sit-down breakfast. Did you guys come in together? Oh, we just ran into each other. We have a consult on a patient, and, um... Yeah, we're now gonna sit down and consult on this patient. She's gonna... help me. Yeah. Right. Cool. Hey, uh, flag me down when you're done. We'll all head in together? Oh, I have a car. Great. Thank you. Save me. Yesterday's bus ride, I sat in cheese. Wow. And I was wearing my cords. Don't wear cords. Enjoy your brecky. (indistinct conversations) (siren wailing in distance) Reycraft. Busy. Reycraft, listen. If I needed some time off, would you cover me? Mat leave? Who's your baby daddy? (chuckles) Seriously, would you? You mean be chief surgical resident while you were gone? (gasps) Not your call. I know. Kinney would have to okay it. So? What's the catch? There is no catch. Sure. I got your back. Hey. Just don't stick a scalpel in it. Look, you take as much time off as you need. I'll do your job. Just can't guarantee I'll give it back. "Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look." "He thinks too much: such men are dangerous." (telephone rings) Did you get laid last night? I'm sorry? You always rock the Shakespeare when you're feeling conquer-y. I do not. You do. So who's the lucky Juliet, Romeo? I don't kiss and tell. You barely even kiss. So I heard about Charlie. (pen clicks) Moving. Could be a host of things. Look, just 'cause he moves a finger, doesn't mean he's gonna wake up today. But it doesn't mean he won't. Maggie : Okay, let me hear it. (clears throat) Now is the knee too much? No, no, no, the knee totally makes it. All right. I can't imagine my life without you, so, Karen Ann Churley, will you marry me? Why, yes, I will. (laughter) Who's this guy? This is your consult. Where's the hardware? Uh, being sized. Tiffany's. So, Mr. Munk, what can I do for you today? Uh, sorry. Um, I'm flying to San Fran tomorrow to surprise my girlfriend. Still don't quite know how I'm gonna do it, though. Early in the evening from the heart, and if it's not from France, it's not champagne. Ah. I'm Dr. Reid. Hi. Wanna come over here and hop on the bed, Benjamin? Sure. You having problems in your abdomen? Relax your abdominal muscles. You have a lot of scarring on your belly. Sutures? Oh. Uh, yeah, pyloric stenosis when I was a week old. And then multiple operations, laparatomies for bowel obstructions. My dad's a surgeon. Where did he practice? Well, right now he's in Malawi fixing cleft palates. Hmm. Impressive. Yeah, he thinks so. Multiple traumas, one minute out. I actually think he knows a surgeon here. I can't remember his name, but supposedly he was this mad orthopedic genius. Joel Goran. Charlie Harris. Ah, Harris. That's him, yeah. He's my fiance. Oh, cool. (groans) Right there. (chuckles and grunts) Hey, how did he propose? Um, we should probably... Well, you can tell him that, uh, Dr. Munk from Winnipeg says hi. I will. I need a full blood panel. Mm-hmm. Coags, group and screen. And do a F.A.S.T. and, Mr. Munk? Yeah? Any other concerns, especially about how to propose? (clicks teeth) She's your gal. (chuckles) Okay? Thank you. Mm-hmm. (man speaks indistinctly) 2 males, early 20s. Roofing accident. Brothers. Alex : Talk to me. Tachycardic, hypotensive with a B.P. 80 over 60. They bolused 3 liters of saline, and he's only a transient responder. G.C.S. 6. Appears to have landed on something. Fluids in the abdomen? Where's Isaac? Where's my brother? Isaac! You all right, buddy? Aah! Aah! Superficial abrasions to the face. Severe open femur fracture. It's a de-gloving injury. It's okay, buddy. So let's get 50 more fentanyl. Alex : Scissors. Let's get him into traction here. (strained voice) Don't let my brother die, please. Man : Just relax, bud. Just relax. How far did your brother fall? From a roof. I don't know. 30 feet? (woman speaks indistinctly) (wheezing) Broken ribs. Flail chest. Tight abdomen. Okay. Possible pneumothorax. I'm really worried about this liver. Let's get this guy out of here. Let's move. (man screams) (woman speaks indistinctly) Let's go. Come on. Suction. I need a clean field of vision. (suction gurgling) Right lobe of the liver is lacerated. (beeps) What do you see? Fractured ribs, open book pelvis. Okay, we're gonna have to pack to get control and then pringle. You're gonna pringle? I know. I don't like it, but we're gonna need all the help we can get. Ladies first. (sighs) Screw that. Start packing. There's this cartoon I remember seeing once when I was a kid... a little guy hanging onto a palm tree, and the tree was swaying back and forth in this monsoon wind one side, and then all the way to the other. (beeps) B.P.'s falling. Son of a bitch. Will you look at that? Alex : Clamp. And this little guy was just hanging on for dear life. Oh, god. That's me. (exhales) That's me. Be calm. It's gonna be okay. It's just coming out everywhere now. No, one more right where that came from. Yeah. Why is that happening? What's wrong? Why is there so much blood? Your broken rib has skewered your liver. Your right lobe has exploded. Well, that doesn't sound too good. It's not. You're in rough shape. (monitor emitting continuous tone) He's arresting. Start C.P.R. Lindsay? Woman : Yes, sir? I can't see what I'm doing here. Code blue! Sponges. All right, give me 2 units of blood and push 1 milligram of epi. Can we get some help here, please? Victor : No pulse. I'm opening saline. (woman over P.A.) O.R. 1, code blue. O.R. 1. He's decompensating, guys. Any results? Are these fluids getting to him? Nothing yet. No pulse. Come on, Isaac. (beeps) No blood pressure. Victor? He's still asystolic. We're losing him. I need more sponges. Joel, are you getting tired? You want me to sub in? No, I'm okay. Give me one more on epi. (panting) I can't stop this bleeding. (Joel continues panting) No. He's bleeding out. Start him on platelets. I'm continuing C.P.R. (continues panting) Charlie : And I just knew, watching, that no matter how hard he held onto that tree... (panting) with the wind that strong... sometimes you just can't hold on. (all exhale) Call it. Time of death... 11: 42 A.M. Maggie : Well, Mr. Munk, your hemoglobin's 95. Uh, in english, please? It should be 130. You're anemic. Oh. It's good news. It explains your fatigue. I'm just gonna write you a script for oral iron. It'll make your stool as black as charcoal, but don't be alarmed. Uh, sorry. I'm anemic? That's all? Yeah. When you get back, we'll do some follow-up tests, but you're free to get on that plane. I'll just be a minute, okay? That is a hefty tome of paperwork. "The swallower" is in the house. She swallowed my phone. Not even kidding. Swallowed my phone. I don't even know how she got it down. She's like the Linda Lovelace of hospital patients. Yikes. Now she's like Captain Hook, ringing from the inside, 'cause my phone's in there, and I don't know who's calling me. That's a hell of a story, Gav. Um, are you sitting on the discharge papers? Uh, yes. Here you go. Thank you. Hey, uh, do you wanna maybe catch a drink later? Where is my patient? (sighs) (breathing heavily) Hey, Mr. Munk you wandered off. Benjamin? Yeah. Uh, sorry. I just felt a little dizzy. Are you okay? Um, I actually feel, uh, not so good. All right. I-I really gotta go, so... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Benjamin. I need help here. Um, uh... So when did you die? I didn't die. I'm in a coma. Coma. Lucky you. So... what happens next? Uh, your body's taken to the morgue. And the rest of me? No idea. It's the end of my limited experience. You either wake up, or you die. And when you die, you disappear. So... why am I still here? That's a very good question. (woman speaks indistinctly over P.A.) (man speaking indistinctly) Mr. Wolfe, I'm Dr. Goran. Are you one of the docs that operated on my brother? I am. And I'm sorry for your loss. So is there anyone we should contact? Parents? They're in Trinidad. A wife or a girlfriend? No. Okay, your scans show that you have significant trauma to the articular surface of the knee. I'm just gonna check, see if you have any sensation. Can you feel that? Yeah. So you and your brother have a roofing company? His big dream. Not yours? Isaac got 500 ball caps made. Advertising. He said that, uh, business cards were old school. He wore that cap everywhere. Mr. Wolfe, you are missing a part of your distal femur, and you have major soft tissue damage here. I have to operate on this immediately. You're gonna lose a part of your leg. (sighs) Mr. Wolfe? I heard you. So there's a couple of options for us to discuss here. One is called a Van Ness rotationplasty. I amputate your leg, I rotate it 180 degrees And then re-attach it. Essentially, your working ankle will become your knee. After that, you attach a small prosthetic to it. With that, you can run, you can jump. Keep working. Whatever. Do whatever you want. I don't care. He just collapsed. Benjamin, how are you feeling now? Uh, worse. You still feeling nauseous? What's, uh, what's happening? We're gonna do everything we can to figure that out. Any other new symptoms? Lower quadrant cramping. I think it's colorectal. I was about to discharge him. It's a good thing you didn't. Yeah, I told him to go off and get married. He will, after we get him better. Dr. Reid! (vomits and coughs) (strained voice) What's wrong with me? (coughing) Cancer? Yes, in your immediate family, not uncles or great aunts. I'm adopted. I-I told her. He did. No known medical history. Is there anything we should know? Mr. Munk? A few years ago, I hunted down my birth mother, but she had passed away from colon cancer. How old was she? 32. The hospital said it was, uh, Lynch something. Lynch syndrome. It's also called H.N.P.C.C. Oh. What? Lynch syndrome is hereditary. Dr. Lin, can you get the colon prep started? Yeah. You can lie back, Benjamin. (sets down clipboard) Your symptoms indicate that there's something wrong in your stomach, but your pain suggests that it's much lower down, like a bowel tumor. Oh, god. I hate hospitals. My dad used to drag me to work sometimes. No fun for a 5-year-old. Is this for my stenosis? I don't think so. Well, the other doctors said they couldn't operate laparoscopically because of all the scarring, so... So I have cancer? Let's not jump to conclusions. (velcro rips) Yeah. I-I just... I'm scared. Right. Right. You deal with this all the time. I mean, just another patient, right? (chuckles) My fiance's in a coma. What? He was in an accident. Oh, my. I'm sorry. I feel terrible. Yesterday he moved his hand, against the odds and the stats, against what everybody else is saying is gonna happen. But he's getting better. Anyway, my whole point is the human body is an amazing thing, Mr. Munk, and we will find out what's wrong with you and then we'll fix it, okay? Okay. (telephone rings) (monitor beeping steadily) Hey. Has Dr. Tolliver been in? You mean since the last time you checked half an hour ago? Yes. No, she has not. Okay, listen, I know you're busy, but I've been doing these exercises... I'm not doing the bra. Do all the nurses know about the bra? Everyone knows about the bra. Jackson. Okay. All right, I'll do it. I'll get him to smell some deodorant, tickle his feet. I am very secure in my masculinity. I know. Thank you. It's just this once. (siren wailing in distance) Nice office. Yeah, bigger than Charlie's. See? In a woman's world, size does matter. Mm. You wanted to see me? Yeah, uh, Johnny Wolfe... I'd like to schedule a Van Ness rotationplasty. Van Ness? Patient's, what, 24 years old? Van Ness is done on children. Not always. Children with tumors. I know, but, Dana, with all due respect, at Sloan, I performed several Van Ness rotations, quite successfully I might add. Why not just do a fusion? Because if I do a fusion, then he's a peg leg forever. This guy's active, 24 years old. He's a laborer. (sniffles) Besides, with the amount of bone loss, his leg'll be that much shorter, and he's gonna require a prosthetic anyway, so why not give him a leg he can do something with? Because the risk of infection is too great and if it fails, the patient's looking at an above-the-knee amputation or worse. No. Too risky. You worried about litigation? (singsongy) Always. Well, my concern's for my patient. (chuckles) Your concern is for your reputation. You want to showboat, go somewhere else. Dana, look, I get it. This is your hospital now. You want to win respect? You gotta start taking some risks. So bet on your winners. My triumph is your glory. Alex : Don't grip the stick too tight. I'm having trouble working the dial with one hand. It just takes practice. Shorten your grip about 20 centimeters, and then you can feed it in. (Benjamin chuckles) Like ice fishing. Never been ice fishing. It's just something that boys make up so they can drink in a shed. Ow! You're doing great, Mr. Munk. 
 
 Whoa, Nelly. So... Dr. Goran... you guys dated? A long time ago, Maggie. Was he a bad boyfriend? (Benjamin hums "bridal chorus from 'lohengrin'") He's just Joel. I, Benjamin... And why did it end between you two? Take thee, Karen Anne Churley... We're almost finished. Just try and keep still. Oh, I love Karen Anne Churley. Yes, Mr. Munk, you keep telling us that. Ooh. Ow. Should we give him a propofol? No. If we perforate, we'd never know. Wow. Will you look at that? What? What is it? Mr. Munk, you have a truly beautiful colon. I do? As flawless as the hope diamond. Congratulations. You mean I don't have cancer? I can marry Karen Anne Churley? Do you still hate hospitals? (cell phone buzzes) (buzz) (beep) I'll be right back. Mm-hmm. I thought I'd better show you right away. Your patient Mr. Munk... strongly positive for occult blood. But his scope was clean. Exactly. So what the hell is going on with this guy? It's a mystery. Yeah. Thanks, Fisher. Yeah. Hey. Do you know where Dr. Murphy is? I'm sorry? Gavin? I need a consult. You need a psych resident? I'm just asking you where he is. I don't mingle with the puppies. Not that one anyway. I'm having fun. What's fun for you isn't always fun for everyone else. Hey. Hey. Mm. Johnny Wolfe, your patient? His wife wants to chat. But he told me he didn't have a wife. Oh, dude, I don't know. He's got some kind of lady friend. Well, it's a hospital, right? So bad things happen. People go into comas. People die. (machine beeps) (man over P.A.) Code blue. B-306. Tom : Where's the crash team? Get in here! Move! Move! Here. Come on. I'll show you. We got a code blue. Let's go. See this guy just died? He's full code. Push 1 mil of epi. They keep trying, but they won't bring him back. (defibrillator whines) Charging 360. And we're gonna see him in a second. Clear. (paddles thunk) Oh, man. Nothing. Drop 300 mils of amiodarone and 20 bicarb. Push more epi. Let's go. Can I do something? Woman : Bag him. Yeah, if you want. Come on. Just, uh, relax and give him the facts. Help him through the fear. Okay. Clear. (paddles thunk) Aah! Aah! Go get him. Go. Go. Aah! Don't panic. It's okay. You're just... You're dead, bro. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! (screaming echoing) Where'd he go? He moved on. That's it? Ten seconds and poof, he's gone? Why won't that happen to me? I don't know. Maybe something's keeping you here. Like you? I'm in a coma. So why haven't you come to? I mean... (sighs) Is there something that you need to do here before you wake up? That's another excellent question. (telephone ringing, indistinct conversations) Mrs. Wolfe? Yes? I'm sorry. He told me that he wasn't married. Depends on what day you get him, I guess. We'd been fighting. Is Johnny gonna make it? This is a major surgery. You know, I'm gonna be removing some of his leg, I'm gonna be reattaching his ankle, and frankly, complications can arise in any procedure. I've been too scared to walk in there. But I need to make my peace with him, in case... (monitor beeping steadily) Get her out of here. Johnny, look at me. You can't just shut me out. Leave. No. We need to talk. You need to let me explain. Explain? What can you tell me that Isaac hasn't already told me? I don't want to hear it. Go. (inhales and exhales deeply) Mr. Wolfe, we're gonna send you down to the O.R. now. (curtain rings swoosh) Hey, Dr. Reid. Who's your friend? This is Dr. Murphy. He's a psychiatrist. Hi. Could I see the backs of your knees? The pain's in my abdomen. Mm. Your knees, please. Uh... Be my guest. You already saw my colon. No point in getting shy now. (chuckles) Needle tracks. All right. I've been taking steroids. Uh, Karen... There's no Karen. Unless you're marrying Karen Churley from the Hope-Zee cafeteria. She's employee of the month. There's posters everywhere. You bled yourself to present as anemic and then you drank the blood so that it would show up in your stool. (chuckles) All right. Look, I... I'm crazy. You made up the girlfriend, the proposal. Dr. Reid? I want you out of this hospital the minute you get out of that bed. Before you go, Dr. Reid, there's something I need to tell you. I swallowed a safety pin. An open one. What? I think I have a perforated bowel. I'm gonna need a C.T. You're lying. Uh, Dr. Reid? Um... I don't know that he is. He heard me talking earlier about our swallower. He's a con man. He's conning us. I can't diagnose him off a 5-minute interview, but even if he is, I... He's a frequent flier, and they often self-harm. I don't believe this. Hey. You startled me. Uh, where you coming from? Radiology. My patient claims to have swallowed a safety pin. Ouch. Yeah, if it's true. Anyways, I'm waiting on a C.T. Have you been in to see Charlie? My Parkinson's clinic went long. I'm way behind, Alex. This coma arousal stuff is working. There's no evidence to prove that. No evidence? Are you kidding me? He moved. Alex, you know as well as I do... Just do me a favor and stop in. And do what? Give him another Glasgow test. Yesterday I did that. Do another one. Alex... Shahir, do another one. It'll take you five minutes. Okay. End of day. That's the best you can do? I do have other patients. Yeah, none of which are the chief of surgery at this hospital. I'm immune to guilt. That wasn't guilt. It presented like guilt. He's progressing, Shahir. Just give me a chance to prove it. Give him another test, okay? (scoffs) Thank you. Turns out a safety pin isn't so safe. Perforated his duodenum. Van Ness rotation. Very exciting. Whole hospital's talking about it. You don't look excited. Well, I convinced Kinney to let me do it and now I have to do it. That's usually how it works, doctor. Yeah, this kid's 24 years old. He's got his whole life ahead of him. I can't screw it up. You won't. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Not used to performing to a full house. That's what you get for doing diva surgeries. Should charge admission. Stage fright? For amateurs. All right. Insert the tourniquet. Tourniquet's up. Good. Okay. Here we go. (drill whirring) Well, I think we know why you're still here. Er and Onan, man. Sorry. What? You don't read the bible, doc? Oh, no. No, no, no, no. That's a big... thick book. Well, so are those anatomy textbooks. Yes, but they have pictures, lots and lots of pictures. It's a story from the old testament. Book  genesis. Two brothers, Er and Onan... sons of Judah. God killed them for loving the same woman. So you told your brother you love his wife and you had a fight. 30 feet up. (voice breaking) My fault. All on me. (inhales deeply) Unfinished business. Unfinished business. That's... why you're still here. Fine. Fine. It's my fault. I know I messed up, okay? I know that. No. It's not gonna do it. (siren whoops) He has Munchausen syndrome. (scoffs) He snowed me. He's seeking medical attention. And I gave it to him. He set the trap and I walked right in. Hospitals make him feel safe. Hospitals aren't meant to make you feel anything. They're meant to get you better. It's not black and white like that. It is. You're either sick or you're not. Or it should be. He is sick, Alex. I should've seen it. He didn't even try to call his "fiancee." Not once. You weren't looking for it. Well, I should've been. He's a smart guy. I've only seen him for an hour, and there's probably other mental health issues, too. He got what he wanted. He'll be here for a while. Yeah. And then he's gonna go and then he's gonna readmit himself and he's gonna readmit himself again. How do you treat patients like that? With patience. That's why they give me the medium-size bucks. (chuckles) I'm gonna keep talking to him. Sure. Just not until after my post-op rounds, okay? All right. Thanks. (knocks on door) You paged me? Yeah, we should talk. Okay. Come on in. Sit down. So, uh, so Reycraft informs me you're looking to take some time of? He told you that? Oh, lots of people tell me all kinds of things. You're stripping in the I.C.U.? Dana... You were slow to catch this Munchausen thing. Nobody caught that. Sure. I just can't help but wonder if two weeks ago you might've been a little quicker off the mark. You're distracted. Doesn't seem to be any room for anything but Charlie. That's not fair. No. What happened to Charlie isn't fair. But you're still a doctor. I need you here, Alex. Okay. I need you here, head in the game. Head in the game. Okay. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Mr. Munk. Hey. (pen clicks) Hey. How are you doing? Oh, a bit rough. Any nausea or vomiting? No. Can you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10? Uh, about a 6, but, uh, I'm good. I'm-I'm okay. (chuckles) No, you're not. You're really not. You're a psychiatric patient now, Mr. Munk. You don't need to live in denial anymore. You think I'm in denial? Yes. You won't even admit that... Well, then I'm not the only one. What? Your fiance. He's defying the odds, defying the medicine. He's gonna defy them all and what, wake up? See... you keep believing the lie, too, Dr. Reid. He made it through. He did. Dr. Goran can be a knob, but he's a great surgeon. Johnny? (exhales deeply) I know you hate me and you want me to go. I don't hate you. We don't have to talk about this now. No. I'm on a morphine drip. So it's probably the perfect time. (crying) I didn't want to fall in love with him. But I couldn't deny how I was feeling, and I should've told you. You didn't think I could tell? If you knew, why didn't you say something? I didn't want to see it. You know, I, uh, thought if I told myself something... enough times, then... well, I should've either fought harder for you, Dalia, or I should've let you go, because... because Isaac died because I didn't... Don't. Because I couldn't... It's not true. It's my fault. It's all on me. Hey. Hey! (moans) Just stop it. (monitor beeping rhythmically, ventilator hissing) (pen scribbling) (loudly) Charlie? Charlie, can you open your eyes for me? Charlie? He's still a 6. He can't be. The numbers don't lie, Alex. There's been no improvement. But he moved. The finger movement... that was involuntary. That's a random firing of the neurons. It's a reflex. It means nothing. I'm sorry, Alex. (sighs deeply) Okay. (groans) Damn it. Hey, look, it's... it's gonna be okay, man. No. No, actually, it's not. (indistinct conversations) (sighs) (exhales deeply) (crying) Charlie? Mm. Oh. (giggles) Mm. (sighs) Screw it. Let's get married. Charlie. No, I'm serious. I'm serious. What are we waiting for? I don't know, maybe our second date? (laughs) Okay. We're just gonna get married anyway. Mm. Is that so? That's so. Just like that? Just like that. Blind faith. (clicks tongue) A feeling. It might just be gas. Oh. Ooh. No. No, it's not gas. You don't believe me? Charlie... this has been amazing. Best time of my life. But patience, my love. Pragmatist. Scientist. Well, I'd like you to meet... (inhales deeply) the optimist. Yin to your yang. I'll live with that. Okay. I'll live with anything if you stick around. Mm. (crying) (knock on door) Oh. (sniffles) Oh. You okay? Yeah. No. I... (sighs) I don't know. (sniffles) How could I get so emotional? Alex... I actually convinced myself that he was getting better. Yeah, you had reason to. He moved. An involuntary reflex. You don't know that. I do know that. I'm a doctor. I am objective. I form conclusions based on what is in front of me, what I can see and touch, not on what I wish for... Alex... And what I'm hoping is true. You believe in him. You believe he's gonna get better. You're not his doctor. You're his lifeline, and right now you are all he's got. Right. So back on the horse... (chuckles) As they say on the ranch. You've never even been on a ranch. Thank you.
