 (Siren wailing, cell phone vibrates) 
 Dr. Reid. 
 Man :  The  Dr. Reid? 
 The pretty one, prone to perfection and deep insecurities? 
 No, this is the one who told you not to call me when I'm working. 
 Listen, girlie, I needs my licorice, okay? 
 It's been too long. 
 So just bring me... two packs should fill the void, all right? 
 Just bring it along with you. 
 Nothing is gonna fill your void. 
 Now some people have to work. Bye. 
 Don't hang up! Don't hang up! I need you! 
 (Touch screen clicks) 
 Suspected pulmonary embolism. 
 A young woman was taken from a plane by island airport. 
 Emergency landing. EMTs got there, stabilized her, and then they radioed ahead, suggesting that we segregate her in an ER room. - Mm. 
 Is she contagious or something? 
 Female, age 21, AB-negative. That's all we got. 
 Okay. 
 Mm! - She didn't get transferred to five prisons in nine months 'cause she's Miss Congeniality. 
 How long was the flight? 
 Three hours from Edmonton. 
 Was she wearing handcuffs the whole time? (Grunts) 
 Why's that matter? 
 Restraints make DVT a greater risk, and then it's boom-- straight to the lungs. 
 Woman grunting : She was cuffed for two hours before the flight... 
 Woman : Let me go! 
 ...and then on the plane, we, uh... 
 Uhh! 
 ...taped her to her seat. 
 With duct tape? 
 It's got a million uses. 
 Better that than she start bleeding... 
 No one touch me! 
 ...from trying to wriggle out of her cuffs, right? 
 Yeah, well, we'll take over from here. 
 One, two, three. (Grunts) 
 Get her sedated before trying to to do any kind of examination. 
 She's no use to me when she's sedated. 
 Get away from me! 
 I need her answering me while I'm examining her. 
 Give her the once-over and let's get her mellow. 
 I don't want you risking your life here. 
 I need these cuffs off. 
 It's not a good idea. 
 (Machinery beeps) She may be your prisoner, but right now, she's my patient, (Woman groans) and I can't examine her in restraints. 
 Let me out! 
 Hey, Lilly. Lilly. 
 Mm. 
 How'd you break your ankle? 
 Mm. 
 Like I said, she's violent and out-of-control. 
 You know what? 
 We're gonna have to ask you to step outside, please. 
 Step back to the waiting room! Thank you! 
 (Machinery beeping) 
 (Radio chatter) 
 Zach? 
 What? 
 Me, too? 
 I just think she would be more comfortable if it was just me. 
 Right. Well, just, you know, remember what happened to Galton at the General? Prisoner beat him with a bedpan. 
 (Gasps) Zach, I can handle this. 
 Just, you know, guy's still eatin' through a straw. 
 (Lilly groans) 
 Okay, Lilly, it's just you and me, okay? 
 Try to relax. 
 (Strained voice) What did they inject me with? 
 Why does it hurt so much? 
 That's what I'm trying to figure out. - Mm! 
 Uhh! Is my cast making it worse? 'Cause my leg is killing me. 
 Just gonna have a look, okay? 
 Is this tender? 
 Uhh! 
 Okay. Okay. (Cries) 
 (Panting) 
 I look over, and Pretty Boy here is bawling his eyes out. 
 It was a 4-hanky film. 
 He had to borrow tissues from the old lady next to us. 
 I'm not afraid to show emotions, so I cried. 
 I think it's kind of sweet. 
 Besides, tears are cathartic. They are a purgative. 
 They allow you to drain off excess emotion. 
 Actually, that's wrong. 
 Yeah, Cornelius' work proved that tears serve a psychological function and act as a primal method of communicating. 
 Like a child crying for its mother? 
 Exactly. 
 Well, the only person who had a dry eye in that house was Maggie. 
 You know what? Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen you cry. 
 I... 
 Hey, Charlie. 
 Hey. 
 Where's the game? 
 Morgue. 
 Can I play? 
 Yep. 
 (Drill whirring) 
 (Whirring stops) 
 Blows air : Thanks to this generous donor, we've got first dibs on two prime femurs, two sweet tibias, and enough cartilage for a dozen transplants. 
 So we harvest the bones and replace them with hockey sticks? 
 Yes. 
 Because of him, a boy will play football, a dancer will pirouette, and a lover will go down on bended knee. 
 Hmm. You've thought this through. 
 Yeah, well, I'm usually alone in the morgue when I'm doing retrieval, so it helps to see the upside. 
 Of all the morgues in all the hospitals in the world, I had to end up here. 
 Excuse me? 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Get her out of here. 
 I can't let her see me like this. 
 She's my daughter. Uh... whoa. Dr. Lin? Yes? Yes. Blows air : Oh. Ho ho! Oh, ho ho. Oh, ho ho. Uh... I-I just remembered. Uh, I've got a consult five minutes ago. Um... rain check this. If it's just a matter of harvesting, I'm sure I could manage. Oh, no. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Uh, it's-- it's-- it's, like, um... it's like cutting down a Christmas tree. It has much more value if I do this myself. But, um... (Sticks clatter) why don't you come with me? We'll, um, we'll do the-- the consult, uh, together. You can help me consult in... So far, I don't see any evidence of a blockage. Uhh! Wait. What? An occlusive thrombus, which means your vein is clogged up. Uhh! (Choking) (Instruments clattering) (Alex grunts) Uhh! Ow! (Grunts) Ow! Ow! (Taser zapping) (Coughs) (Thud) Woman over PA : Code White, emergency. You're welcome. Holy hell. Woman : Dr. Reid, are you okay? (Gasps) All right, I'm gonna see her in two weeks. Okay. Let me take a look. Oh! You look beautiful. All right, we'll see you. See you later. Dana. How are ya? Joel. It's so nice. Nice? Mm-hmm. Really? That's your best line? Well... Mm, you are never gonna make it in the private sector. I mean, look around. We built this place on Botox, silicone, and fawning compliments. Come here. Do I sense a little regret? Regret? Not a bit. Yeah? Take a look. So can I get you something? Water? Espresso?  Champagne? (Chuckles) (Chuckles) Come on, Dana. What are you doing here? What? What are you doing here? You're not cut out for this high priced nonsense. Look, don't tell me you don't miss Hope Zion. What, miss that old boy's club where I was passed over as chief of surgery? No, I don't miss it a bit. And I'm not going back if that's what you're asking. One surgery. Something only you could do. And look, I know you're busy. I don't like to ask-- Then don't, because I'm booked into the next millennium. Okay. Okay. All right. So we better get going if we're gonna have lunch. I'm meeting my architect at 2: 00. Okay. Thank you. (Siren wailing) If this is an accurate account of events, you can just sign right there. What is it? It's an incident report. It's required when there's been an incident. Yeah, the hospital has me do one, too. Yeah, the taser delivers 50,000 volts, but the paperwork's worse. Thank you. Welcome. As requested. From my experience, most of these criminals are malingerers. Hospital is just a vacation to them. She's hardly faking it. Granted, her D-dimer's high, but we always get crazy fibrin levels if there's broken bones. Her Wells score is a 7. Look, Joel's on a warpath about unnecessary testing. It's a 7. We don't have a choice. Sighs : Okay. I'll run her up to CT angio for you. Thank you. (Cell phone vibrates) (Touch screen clicks) Don't they restrict your phone use? Man : You do understand I'm a very charming fellow, because others  do. They hear my story. They long to help. Don't call me during working hours. Don't bark at me. I'm sensitive. Now are you gonna pick me up from this hell or send a limo? What part of "no" didn't you understand? (Touch screen clicks) Problem? I can handle it. I mean, aside from being bitten by a prisoner. It was no biggie. No, come here. Coat off, please. Charlie... Alex. I'm okay. Mm. Look. The bite hardly pierced the skin. You were bitten by an inmate from a prison awash in hep-C. If her blood panel comes back positive, you're gonna be on Interferon for a year. Now... (Siren wailing) (Laughs) deep breath. (Inhales deeply) Okay. You're not getting sick on my watch. Thank you, Doctor. (Laughs) (Various machines beep) Zach. (Beep) That, uh, that bone donor down in the morgue-- what can you tell me about him? Uh, massive heart attack. Guy was dead when the paramedics brought him in. You know how those guys hate to pronounce. So you signed the death certificate? Uh, well, yeah, I gave him a full resus, and he was warm and dead when I finally declared. Gave him a celestial release. Did the paramedics happen to mention where they picked him up? Is this really necessary? He was at a rub and tug when the cruel hand of fate yanked his chain. Happy now? He died at a massage parlor? Which I imagine has gotta be like dying all alone, you know? It certainly lacks poetry, yeah. Mind you... I've seen worse. You never twigged that it was Maggie's dad? He's  that... - Yep. World-famous Dr. Lin? No. Yep. Really? Yep. Does she know? No. Mnh. Look, I, uh, I hope you don't mind. I took the liberty of ordering ahead. Thank you. Oh. Oh! Um, I wasn't sure on whether or not you preferred spicy or mild, so I got both. Mmm. Um, this is Alicha Wat. Mm-hmm. Uh, this is mild. After all we've been through, that's how you see me? No. I know you only pretend to be conventional. So let's, uh, try this one. This is, uh, Key Wat. It's got a little bit more kick to it. Here. (Laughs). Joel? What? You don't have to feed me. No. This is the custom. This is called, uh,  gursha. It's like, the bigger the  gursha,  the bigger the-- the bond between us. Oh, that's right. You were in Ethiopia, weren't you? Weren't you at one of the refugee camps? Yeah, in Sherkole and Bambassi, actually. But try it. Okay. That's it. Mm. Joel. I just-- I-I think we should kind of keep our  gurshas to ourselves, if that's okay. All right. (Sighs) Salud. Mm-hmm. ♪ Mmm! Mmm! (Chuckles) (Mouth full) Oh! That's not bad. What is that spice? Berbere. A sort of barbecue rub. It's a... oh. Hey, man. (Lowered voice) Told you she'd come. (Normal voice) So, um, this is Dembele. Uh, Dana. Uh, Dembele's actually a line cook here, but he prepared all of this today for us. Dembele? That's, um, that's a lovely name. And an old one in my country. Mm-hmm. I'm from Mali. Yeah, but don't let that fool you. He's  the  single greatest Ethiopian chef in town. How'd that happen? I walked to Ethiopia. From Mali? Yes. I got very hungry and I learned to cook. (Laughs) You... ♪ Well, this is delicious. Thank you. Thank you so much, man. Joel. Yeah? He has facial paralysis. Only on one side. It's not total, okay? And you brought me here just to see him. That's not true. To enjoy the delicious food and wonderful company. This is the guy you wanted me to operate on, right? I don't believe this. Dana, this is  one  surgery, all right? Oh! Oh! - It's a few hours away from that moneymaking machine that you call a practice, and he... Dana, you can help him. Joel, I'm sorry, but I am done with that hospital. Alex : Talk to me. Jackson : Her blood pressure's dropping through the floor. She's desatting. Lilly, I'm just gonna do a brief examination, okay? (Jackson) Look at the color of the blood. Yeah. And her cervix is patulous. Call Code Omega. Hang blood and initiate massive transfusion protocols. 4 units FFP, 2 milligrams of IV vitamin K, and then let's run coags, CBCs, thrombin time, and check fibrinogen again. (Sighs deeply) Hey. Lilly, there is no easy way to say this. You're having a miscarriage. You're in a prison. You're single, so there are no conjugal visits. You gotta help me out here, Lilly. How did you get pregnant? He's none of your business. I'm not asking for a name. 'Cause you won't get one. The only thing that I have left is my word, and I ain't breaking it. Did you know you were pregnant? Of course I didn't! Lilly, I can't help you if I don't have a full picture. Help  me? You almost killed me! I get why you're upset. I do. But I am gonna need you to give me access to your medical files. So you can help me, like all the others helped me? No way. (Door opens) Whoa, whoa. What-- what-- what is all this? Her afternoon pills. That's half the pharmacy. Lilly... can you tell me what these are for? Did they explain it to you? Go to hell. Charlie : So, uh, you finally retired? Well, slowed down. I was gonna take the McDaniels chair in Medical Ethics at the university. That little massage parlor incident might've put a damper on your moral authority. Like you never? (Beep) No, but I'm not judging. Yeah, just taking perverse pleasure in my misfortune. No. (Clears throat) Oh. That's, um... That's Maggie's boyfriend. Yeah? Okay. Really? - Thanks. He's a good guy. Yeah, so he's unlike me then. He's a shrink. Are you trying to hurt me? Hey, Gavin. Uh, you got a sec? Yeah. What's up? Uh, this morning, um, Maggie was helping me do a-a harvest on that bone donor. You know? Yeah. Uh, why? Did something happen? What? No, she's fine. Bit of a worrywart. Uh, well, it turns out that the donor was-- is...  is,  uh... Maggie's dad. Mr. Lin? Dr.  Lin? Yeah. The point is, Maggie doesn't actually know. Yeah. (Clears throat) Yeah, okay. Yeah, I guess... if someone's gonna tell her, I guess it should probably be me. I was kinda hoping you'd say that. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Good luck with that. (Sighs) Well, thanks for not mentioning the Blue Lagoon. Oh, no, doc, that secret dies with you-- you and your masseuse. I hoped you tipped her well. Tipped her... uh... (PA beeps) (Man speaking indistinctly over PA) (Papers shuffling) Hey. Hey. Is it just me, or is Charlie Harris getting nuttier? First he invites me to assist, and then we get to the morgue and he blows me off with some lame excuse. Um... Mags, it's about your father. He didn't call you, did he? I've never met him. He keeps texting me about dinner next week. I need to get back to him. Yeah, that's just the thing. Um... He died last night. Was it a heart attack? Yeah. He's the body in the morgue, isn't he? That's why Charlie wouldn't... I need to call my mother. Hey. Hey. Uh, how was, uh, breaking bread with Dana? She turned me down. Did you try plan "B," the introduce-her- to-the-patient approach? I did. She still said no. Kind of cold. Yeah, she's changed, man. No, no, she hasn't changed. She wants to change, but she can't. Do you want a plan "C"? Sure. Call her up, and let slip that you're gonna let Dr. Storms do the procedure. Mm, Storms has been suspended. No, just... She doesn't know that. Try it. Just try it. 'Kay. One, two, three Benzos. How much anxiety could a girl have? See, these pills are more to manage her behavior than to treat any illness. Right, but the question is, what's she got? And without her medical records, we're in the dark. Nothing in the DSM requires all these. Could the drugs themselves be making her crazy? Given to someone who doesn't need them, yeah. Absolutely. Okay, well, she's had 10 units of blood to help deal with the hemorrhaging. Most of these drugs should have washed out of her system. Most, yeah. But the Pams are metabolized through fat cells, so they take a little longer to clear. What if you add a lipid drip? Uh, that speeds things up. Okay. I want to withhold all drugs, see if we can get a glimpse of the real Lilly. Okay. Except for these ones. They require a slow taper. All right. Thank you. (Door closes) Dana : Miss Frank is gonna call in a month. Enjoy. Woman : Thank you. 
 
 ♪ Dembele. Um... (Clears throat) I understand that you want to see me, but I... I'm afraid I'm very busy. And so without an appointment, you're just gonna have to wait. I've been waiting 11 months and 17 days, Doctor. I can wait a little longer. (Machine beeps) (Respirator hissing) (Clicks) (Door closes) I'm sorry for what I said to you, and that I bit you. I know. And I'm-- I'm not just saying that to get out of these. You need to put me back on my meds. I get rages. This wildness comes over me, and I do things. Things you regret? Not everything. I don't regret Percy. He was the only person who ever had a kind word for me. We all need that. When did you meet Percy? I met him at Milton. He's a librarian there. He would save the women's mags for me so I could do the quizzes first. So is he your boyfriend? (Laughs) He tried to say no, but I had my mind set on him. I am a Leo after all. It would have been a nice baby. Smart. You know? Lilly, I want to help you. But without your medical files, my hands are tied. (Exhales) Okay. But I'm trusting you. I know. (Indistinct conversations, equipment beeping) Dr. Reid. Good news. Really? Thanks to you. Me? Corrections is all over my incident report. They're filing new charges against Lilly for the assault. Wait. There's no need to pursue that. I'm fine. That's not for you or me to decide. She's woken the beast now. The beast? The system. Instead of another stay in minimum, she's going to Millburn. The SHU-- Special Handling Unit. Maximum security. No. You can't do that. They will just drug her out again. I'm trying to detox her off those drugs so that we can find out what's really wrong with her. There's nothing wrong with her that maximum security won't fix. Box of chocolates. That's how she gets into the system. 15 years old, steals a box of chocolates to give to her mom for Valentine's Day. Is she still in prison? Well, she got probation for that and then... What? Assaulted her probation officer with a school lunch box. Got juvie for that, and then... yeah, more assaults. More assaults. Uh, "Staff were attempting to stop self-harming behaviors." Like cutting herself? Yeah. Attempts at hanging-- four. Slashed her wrist twice. Head banging. God, she was in restraints half the time she's been in custody. So she tries to kill herself six times, and she wasn't sectioned for mental health? What gives? (Mouths words) (Siren wailing in distance) (Pen scratching) (Scoffs) You really are a manipulative prick. And to what do I owe the pleasure of this abuse? Sending Dembele around to my office when I told you "No." Well, he was a patient with a condition that you could fix. That's all that really matters. Really, Joel? Is that true? Because you seem to be going to great lengths here, and I'm not sure why this guy is so important to you. Well, maybe because he was a slave, Dana. A what? He was an actual slave on a cocoa plantation. I mean, did you ever see the marks on his wrists? Those are from shackles. The scar on his face, the reason that his facial nerve was severed, that was from fighting off a guard while escaping. I mean, do you know what kept this guy going? What? Love kept this guy going. Dembele goes home, he returns to Mali, all right, only to find that the woman, his woman, has been married off by her family. This guy walked  across Africa just to reclaim her. Hmm. Well, that's a very romantic story. It's an incredibly romantic story. I mean, the guy's a hero. He deserves much better. (Pen cap clicks) I know. He told me the whole thing. I just wanted to hear you tell me that story, and it was good. So do you remember anything from your fellowship in microsurgery? Of course I do. Good, because I worked out a plan, and it's gonna require two teams working simultaneously. Hate what you've done with the place, by the way. Okay. So from the examination, it's clear they should be able to harvest the sural nerve from his leg. Mm-hmm? They then coapt it to this buccal branch, and the proximal end is then passed through to the contralateral lip. They should be fine. You're saying "They." By that you mean you and me, right? There's a complete decision tree here. I'm sure they're gonna be able to find it. There's-- - No. No. No. Dana, there is no "They" in this. If you don't do this now, his facial musculature will be irreversibly atrophic. You still have time to assemble a team. Good luck. Dana. It's been almost a year. What are you talk-- Look, you wrote a damn paper on this thing. Look, if we don't do this, the muscle dies and the paralysis is permanent. Need to do this now. Joel. I just... I can't come back here. I'm sorry. Okay. It's fine. We'll just let Dr. Storms take care of it. Storms? He seems like a competent plastics guy. Are you kidding me? After all poor Dembele has been through, you're gonna let that idiot Storms ruin the poor man's face? Well, it's not really my decision, is it, Dana? (Exhales) (Machine beeping) Look at you. Your color's back. Vitals are stable. These are all good signs. They're taking me to the SHU. You have to be crazy to survive in there. I need those meds. You have to give those meds back to me. I need... (Machines beeping rapidly) (Gasps, wheezing) Jackson, 2 milligrams of Lorazepam IV, and call Shahir. Okay, can I get some help here? - Need help in here! I'm gonna be turning you over, all right? Don't try to help me. Just relax. And... go. There we go. We're here. Everything is gonna be okay. We're gonna ride this out together. It's gonna be over soon. Okay? Breathe in. Breathe out. And we're here with you. How long has she been seizing? Just started. (Lilly grunting) (Gulps, breathing deeply) It's over. It's gonna be okay. Let's turn her over. Alex. You see this? What? Alex : Those rings? I didn't see those till now. They're called Kayser-Fleischer rings. I think your patient has Wilson's disease. So you're telling me all of her bizarre behaviors have an organic basis? If it's Wilson's, yes. (Indistinct conversations) Hey. (Exhales) My father was a man on a mission. Must have been intimidating living in his shadow. I would have loved that. But he was never around. Right. World Health Organization's in Geneva. Took the job without even asking mom. Was that why they divorced? Abandoned his family to help other people. Who does that? I've only ever seen the one case of Wilson's, back when I was doing my residency in New York. It's textbook rare, isn't it? Yeah, this girl was... What are you, 19? 21. No, she was much younger. Usually Kayser-Fleischer rings don't show up until the late teens. Guys. 'Sup? We'll be right back, okay? Okay. So what causes them? Copper deposits. Right. People with Wilson's can't process copper. That's right. It builds up in the body. They started as crescents, and then over time, they-- they become full circles. Look at these symptoms. Hmm? Prone to miscarriages, rages, sexually aggressive manor. Mm-hmm. That's the copper. It acts on the basal ganglia. And effects decision making, right? Yes. Definitely yes. So if she had been properly diagnosed and prescribed the right medications, she never would have gotten into trouble? Uh, probably not. It's a progressive disease, isn't it? She's only gonna get worse over time? All the more reason that she shouldn't spend her life behind bars. Are you certain that it's Wilson's? Her symptoms are indicative, not conclusive. The best way to find out is DNA testing. That'll take weeks. Well, then a liver biopsy. Can't risk it. She's lost too much blood. Surely there's some way that's less invasive? Um... well, there may be another method. Dana : All right, I'll take the tumescence now. (Dr. Baumann) 15 ccs of epinephrine, come on down. (Machine beeps) Number 15. I'll take protractors and my face-lift scissors. Are you really gonna do it that way? Well, it branches less from bottom to top than it does from top to bottom. Remind me never to take you to a knife fight. Nerve stripper. Dana : Looks like I'm gonna need about 12 centimeters up here. Forceps and loop. If I were any further up inside this guy, he'd be a sock puppet. All right. Hand me the nerve-stim. Woman : Here you go. Dana : You might want to pay attention here, because if this nerve is dead, we're gonna have to close him up and go home. Ready? Mm-hmm. (Scoffs) Don't worry about it. I think third time's the charm. Dana : I knew it. Joel : What? Underneath that cynical veneer, you're a romantic. (Laughs) Okay. Last chance. Here we go. (Machine beeping) Oh! Amazing. Yeah! Man, that's what I wanted to see. Okay. That one has pure function. Looks like we're in business here. This might actually work. How you doing down there? Joel : Severing the nerve right now. Dana : I'm gonna prep the other side. (Machine beeps) Joel : And behold. The white worm. Dana : Very nice. 4.0 to close, please. Charlie. Oh. I want to help. That's not gonna happen, Maggie. My father was a doctor. I'm a doctor. We're trained to be dispassionate, objective. Uh, not when it comes to family. That's why we don't treat 'em, prescribe to 'em, or operate on 'em. I get that. But... this is different. This is one thing that I could do for him that would really mean something. I'm not comfortable with this Maggie. I'm sorry. I can't cry for him. He's why I became a doctor. He'd want me to do this for him. I don't know. Come on, Charlie. He could've died in a dozen hospitals in this town, but he didn't. That has to mean something. Let me do this. (Exhales deeply) That's my girl. You okay? Yeah. I'm my father's daughter. You wanna use the 8-0. Yes, ma'am. And don't be a guy, all right? More is not better. Two stitches is all I want. Just tack it together. That is all you are gonna get. 'Cause it's kind of like gardening, right? You wanna keep it nice and loose and casual, and then the nerves sprout all sorts of pretty axons. God, I love it when you talk dirty to me. (Chuckles) Steady. (Taps keyboard) Shahir : This is an MRI of a brain with Wilson's, and here... (Taps keyboard) is the image I just took of Lilly's brain. It's the same. Mm-hmm. What's that structure there? Hmm. You'll note the symmetric bilateral areas of T2 hyperintensity involving subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, external capsules, thalami, midbrain, and pons. Note it, yes. Understand it? Not so much. Well, the disease progressively involves more and more of the midbrain. So this happens over many years? Yes. And these are the copper deposits right there? Definitely. You know, it took me a while to recall the paper that imaged a distinctive feature of Wilson's. They call it the Face of the Giant Panda. See the eyes? Gavin : Eyes,  and...  maybe a snout. These dots. Mm-hmm. They're formed in the central tagmental tract. Okay. So... Lilly has Wilson's, then? Mm-hmm. So you do know there was never any chance of Storms operating on that surgery today, don't you? No, I didn't, but I just heard he'd been suspended by the board. That was  low. - You impressed? It's something Charlie Harris would pull, so yes. We were good in there today, Dana. A good team. Mm-hmm. So, you know, with Storms gone, your old job's open again. It's yours if you want it, and I know you want it. Oh, do you? Mm-hmm. What I saw you do today with Dembele, I mean, that was... (Inhales deeply) You changed a man's life. I mean, it's gotta be a little bit more gratifying than vacuuming fat out of an ass, right? I don't-- You know the thing about my old job here? I've done it. I've moved on. Okay. What if you could do the kind of meaningful surgery that we did today, every day? Think about that. (Clicks tongue) Okay. You know, when you called me the other day for lunch, I thought... You thought what? (Siren wailing in distance) Nothing. So I'll start you on a drug called tetrathiomolybdate. It'll stop your body from absorbing any more copper. And then we'll work on a diet program from here on out. Officer Hazard. I was just going over Lilly's treatment. Her "treatment" is prison. Now that we know what she's suffering from, her condition can be managed. You're not gonna see the same behavioral problems because we're gonna-- Because she'll be locked in a box. That is not fair. You can't go ahead with this transfer. Is she stable enough to travel? Yes. But I don't think that it-- Get her ready. I'm ordering an ambulance. We'll leave as soon as it gets here. You say that prison isn't the place for me, that I'm sick. But I still have to go? How is that right? Lilly, I am not gonna let that happen to you. Please, don't get my hopes up. You can't win with these people. You just had to keep picking at me like some scab, like some mystery to be solved. That's what we do here. We find out what's wrong. But what's the point if you can't fix it? We can treat it and we can manage it, but none of that is gonna happen if you go to prison tonight. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! We're transferring her to the psych ward. You're not taking her anywhere. She's my prisoner. I'm afraid not. I've invoked my authority as her primary caregiver to section her under Form One of the Mental Health Act. This is BS. You can't do that. Yeah, actually, she can. Lilly's gonna be held for assessment on our closed psych ward for 72 hours. Longer if necessary. Why the hell are you doing this? She is a crazed felon. She belongs in prison. Are you kidding me. Prison made her crazy. So if you'll just sign this transfer of custody... This isn't over. You wanna hang around? Book a hotel room. Alex : I have called a lawyer I know, and he's gonna come in tomorrow, consult with you. He thinks that he can get the authorities to back down and let you serve out the rest of your sentence in minimum security. Why are you doing all this? First rule of medicine-- "Do no harm." ♪ And...

♪ (Child crying in distance) So now I hear you're advocating for this girl who bit you. I-I guess I'm just trying to make up for everyone who let her down, that's all. Mm-hmm. Do you want the good news or the bad news? I could use some good. Okay. Well, the good news is, um, your prisoner patient has neither hep-C not HIV. That's good. And the bad? Uh, the bad news is she could still be a teenage werewolf. (Sighs deeply) It's quite popular these days. And a tad overdone, do you think? (Chuckles) So is the vampire thing. I'm sick of that. Yeah. Uh, Charlie... There's this thing I gotta go do. Hmm. Something to do with that phone call you got? You don't miss much, do you, Doctor? Not much. Just you. Come home soon. I will. This is the last time. (Whispers) - Ohh. (Normal voice) I like your positivity. This is not funny, Luke. I was starting to think you were gonna bail on me, girlie. Hey, you know what? I haven't been "girlie" since dad died. Okay. Hey, look at this thing. Can I drive? Are you kidding me? After what you did to the front window of that pie shop? I don't think so. Come on. Licorice.

Here. ♪ Dig around for my wallet. You can take it. There's about 100 bucks. It's all yours. Alex, I can't. Yeah, you can. Well, I'd rather you take it from me than ask mom. I'm gonna pay you back. Yeah. Luke, I'd really like to believe you. But I'm not gonna hold my breath. You're gonna get it back, with interest. (Sighs) All right? You know I'm not talking about the money, right? Girlie, I make mistakes. It's who I am. Yeah, and you're good at it. What is that? What-- you see w-- That's what I'm talking about. You don't actually think that I can change. No. So now this is  my  fault? No, it's not your fault. But you can cut me some slack. I'm trying. Okay. I'm sure you're hungry. I could eat. All right. Well, keep your eyes peeled. It's on you. ♪ Actually, it's on  you. (Laughs)
