 "The defriender." 
 That's what people are calling me? 
 That's what the nurses are calling you. 
 Okay. You know what? 
 If it means what I think it means, I have not "defriended" a nurse... (chuckles) in, like, almost three months. 
 Are you seeing someone? 
 Yes, I am, actually. 
 That's... great. 
 That's amazing. 
 Yeah, I mean, it's early days, yeah. 
 She's a sweet girl, though. She has a kid, actually. 
 I'm happy for you. 
 Okay, we are on the wrong road. 
 And that little bouncy ball is totally gone. 
 We're gonna have to find somewhere to stop. 
 Don't worry about it. It's like a big resort. 
 There'll be signs for it everywhere... 
 Oh, I remember this well, Joel... 
 What? 
 Your instinctive sense of direction. 
 We will get somewhere, but it won't be the trauma conference. 
 It'll be a B&B where you make your own jam. 
 Ouch! Holy! 
 You know what? (chuckles) 
 One... my jam was delicious. 
 Two... you had an excellent... 
 Joel, that's not the point. 
 You had an excellent time on that trip. 
 And you know what? For the record, I cannot believe that Charlie... 
 You know, I can't believe that any man would give up a dirty weekend with you at a medical conference just to go and pick up his friend at the airport, I'm just saying. 
 It's Ford. It's his best friend. 
 (singsongy) Dirty weekend. 
 That's why you don't have any friends. 
 By the way, Charlie is coming. He's just running late. 
 (chuckles) Hey, there's a gas station. 
 Pull over. 
 You got it. 
 ♪ 
 (siren whoops, radio chatter) 
 Hey. 
 Zach, this, uh, fiend here is Thomas Ford... 
 My friend, former roommate, and general hell-raiser. (gurney clacks) 
 Welcome, Thomas Ford. What, uh, is the problem? 
 Um, Ford flew commercial from the central South African Republic with some apparent leg trouble. 
 Exactly. I traveled thousands of miles, And he's mad because I screwed up his plans with who? 
 Alex. 
 Alex. Alex? 
 I don't know. I stopped at Dawn, buddy. (chuckles) 
 You met Alex, Ford. 
 We had four bottles of wine, and you tried to kiss her. 
 Yeah, I don't remember names until I'm sure they'll stick, my friend. 
 So what do you do over there in the central South African Republic? 
 I take pictures. 
 You ever see that photo of the, uh, Woman in Karachi holding her child... the one with the, um... 
 With the eyes in front of the thing... 
 You took that? 
 Yeah. 
 I got it, I got it, I got the leg. (grunts) Thanks, Charles. 
 My hero. 
 (grunts) All right. 
 Start a dopamine drip and get him pip tazo. 
 So what happened? You, uh, get shot over there? 
 No. I got hit by a truck. 
 Got too close to the action. 
 They patched me up in a field hospital, but I had a sense I should get home to a real doctor. 
 Scissors. 
 He flew like this? 
 He greased the flight attendants. 
 Charles, my straight-laced chum. 
 Open up the present. You'll see why. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (gasps) 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 (chuckles) 
 (groans) 
 Charles... you can fix this, right? 
 Where are you going? 
 To change. 
 I'm late, and I don't really want to give my presentation in a pair of jeans. 
 Ooh, I remember this one. 
 What? 
 The inevitable breakdown that happens whenever you think you're gonna be late. 
 Okay, this isn't a breakdown. 
 I have to give a speech on the laparoscopic repair of diaphragmatic injuries in an hour and a half. 
 And the last time I checked, we were, oh, two hours away from the damn hotel. 
 We're closer than two hours. 
 No, no, no. 
 No, it's okay, love. 
 I've got it. 
 Okay. So, uh... do you want me to change the dinner reservation then? 
 Charlie : Uh, probably. 
 I'm sorry, honey. I know this was supposed to be our weekend... 
 Give me that. Give me that. 
 Alex Reid, you gorgeous woman, lover of Charles, healer of mankind. 
 Shouldn't you be in some war zone somewhere, Ford... sneaking into some beautiful woman's tent? 
 (chuckles) Alex, I love you. 
 I know Charles loves you. 
 But you're gonna have to stay... for the moment at least... separated, for I am in need of a physician. 
 And the physician I need is the same man that you love. 
 Charles is his name. 
 Are you stoned? 
 No. No. It's probably the pain meds. 
 This is very real, I assure you. 
 There, she totally forgives you. 
 Stop talking, please. 
 Up his dopamine, and give him 25 mikes of fentanyl. 
 And hit him over the head with a baseball bat. 
 (chuckles) Hey, um, I will get on the road as soon as I can. But, um... 
 Ford's... kind of in a bad way. 
 (sighs) In a bad way, like, hungover? 
 No. Bad like his leg is mangled and he's septic. 
 I'm sorry, honey. I gotta go. 
 (sighs) He's your friend. 
 Fix his leg. 
 (sighs) I love you. 
 Love you. 
 (cell phone beeps) 
 (gas tank lid clunks) 
 (birds chirping) 
 (cash register beeps) 
 (woman) You're gonna have to muzzle that dog. 
 (sighs) 
 (woman) I know. He's aggressive. 
 (man) ♪ bring me down ♪ 
♪ make me blue ♪ 
 You might want to get that checked out, man. 
 What? 
 The tattoo. 
 Whoever did that does not know how to autoclave. 
 It's... You might want to get checked out for hep-C as well, by the looks of things. 
 It's pretty bad. 
 What are you, a lawyer? 
 No, I'm a doctor, man. 
 Honestly, that looks pretty damn fierce. 
 You could... you don't want a deep infection, or... 
 Are you... are you feeling okay, man? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Are you feeling okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm really good. I just... 
 Hey, energy drink, You gonna pay or what? 
 (gun cocks) Empty the cash. 
 Whoa, dude! 
 Right now. On the counter! 
 Don't stand there! Do it! 
 Okay. 
 Gimme your wallet. Gimme me your keys, phone, everything, now! 
 Yeah. Y-you got it! 
 (slaps counter) On the counter! On the counter! 
 Move it! Move it! Move it! 
 Okay. 
 Hurry up! Hurry up! 
 (slaps cash register) Empty it! Let's go! 
 Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick! Motor! 
 Where's the safe?! 
 We don't have a safe. 
 You don't have a safe? 
 No. 
 Hurry up! Hurry up! 
 Look, okay. 
 These are my car keys, all right? 
 (keys jingle) 
 Okay, man, it's parked outside. 
 Take it. (keys jingle) 
 (gun clicks) 
 That's it?! That's all?! 
 Dude, the car's worth a lot of money. Just take it. 
 (door bells jingle) 
 Joel, did you fi... 
 Alex! 
 Lie down! 
 Lie down on the ground! 
 Okay! 
 Give me the purse. Throw it to me. 
 Okay, okay! 
 Okay, buddy, you got what you wanted. It's... 
 You, move! Go! Go! (grunts) 
 (objects clatter, bills rustle) 
 (whispers) Stay down. 
 (coins jingle) 
 Where's the money?! 
 Why don't you have any more money? 
 You have all our money! 
 Shut up! 
 (grunts and groans) 
 (objects clatter) 
 Joel! 
 (groaning) I got it. 
 Ugh! 
 How is she? 
 Let me see it. (tires peal, vehicle departs) 
 Ah, it hit her femoral vein. 
 She's bleeding out. 
 What's your name? 
 Diane. 
 Okay. Diane, we're doctors. 
 (grunts) We're gonna take care of you. 
 Okay? (breathing heavily) 
 We need to check for an exit wound. 
 Let's roll her. 
 Yeah. You ready, Diane? 
 (grunts) 
 (groans) 
 (strained voice) Ow. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah. There's an exit wound here at the gluteal fold. 
 Um, give me a second. 
 Okay. Got it. 
 All right. Let's lower her. (groaning) 
 I will keep pressure. 
 We've gotta call for medics. 
 You know, he's got my phone. 
 Mine was in my bag. 
 Does the wall phone work, Diane? 
 Yeah. Works great. 
 Okay, I got it. (phone receiver clatters) 
 I know you're scared, but I'm here with you the whole way, okay? 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Yes, I would like an ambulance, uh, at the gas station off rural route 3, please. 
 We're on concession road 4. 
 Concession road 4 is what I meant. 
 Stay with me. 
 Okay, well... yes. 
 You're doing a good job, Diane. 
 Uh, I'm a doctor. I'm telling you that we have a woman here with a serious G.S.W. in her upper thigh. (sighs) 
 Okay. Uh, yeah, okay. 
 (telephone dings) 
 What do we got? 
 45 minutes. 
 What? 
 I said 45 minutes, Alex. 
 Joel! 
 Diane : How long you guys been married? 
 (grunts) 
 All right, Thomas. 
 I'm going to tell you exactly what's happening, and I know you won't freak out. (chuckles) 
 Do I get more awesome drugs if I do freak out? 
 You have a compound tibial fracture, obviously. 
 It's broken in several places. 
 And that crazy-looking thing is keeping your leg from falling apart. 
 But the whole thing is badly infected. 
 I gon... am I gonna lose my leg? 
 The infection has spread to your lymph nodes. 
 So you might... you might lose your leg, yes. 
 (sniffs) Great. 
 A war photographer in a wheelchair. 
 You'll see all the women tearing up over that one, huh? 
 Charlie... (sighs) 
 Charles. Hombre.... 
 I can't work with one leg. 
 We'll do the best we can, okay? 
 No, don't give me that line, all right? Just... fix my leg. 
 You'll let me do my job? 
 (monitor beeps) 
 You're pissed off at me, huh? 
 For screwing up your weekend? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I am pissed off at you. (laughs) 
 But Alex is gonna understand. Because she knows I never get to spend any quality time with you. 
 Oh, that's sweet. 
 It is, isn't it? 
 She must be the one. 
 (laughs) We're gonna get you through this, buddy. 
 Hey, Charles. 
 See ya on the other side. 
 (whooshes) 
 (wrapper crinkles) 
 Okay, so obviously these are for cars, but they'll do for now. 
 I'm sorry I snapped at you before. 
 That's okay. 
 Diane, how are you feeling? 
 Cold as a well digger's ass. 
 (grunts) Can you grab that blanket for me? 
 You got it. 
 Okay. 
 Diane, you're in shock. 
 We're gonna get you warm, and we're gonna get you help. 
 Where's Jack? 
 Jack? 
 My husband. 
 Where's your husband, Diane? 
 He's outside. 
 Okay. Well, I'll go look for your husband as soon as we get this bleeding under control. 
 I had needles and sutures in my car. 
 Well, I hope he's enjoying his joyride. 
 Where's your car parked, Diane? 
 It's busted. 
 Jack's working on it. 
 That's good to know. 
 Pulse is thready. 
 Her wound won't stop oozing. 
 We need to tamponade the bleeding. 
 Okay, I need a tube, something narrow, dental floss, and a condom. 
 Are you gonna MacGyver a balloon tamponade? 
 Yeah, we are. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 This is bewildering. It is really bewildering. 
 Every doctor gets a complaint at some point. 
 I mean, if you want to come in and talk about it... 
 What? That would be absurd. 
 Hello. 
 What is that for? 
 I'm going into an 8-hour surgery. 
 I thought I'd get some sugar first. 
 Can I get your opinion on something first, Dr. Lin? 
 I have a patient with a brain tumor. 
 And he's lodged a complaint against me. 
 Why? 
 Apparently, I have bad bedside manner. 
 (scoffs) Really? 
 (chuckles) Well, you kinda do. 
 Now I have to tell him That his tumor was wrapped around his brain stem. 
 He's terminal. 
 See, don't say it like that. 
 Look, I don't see why he expects false empathy along with the facts. 
 It's not gonna change his outcome. 
 Well, not all empathy is false, right? 
 Mnh-mnh. Studies show that patients actually do better if they feel their doctor likes them. 
 Not mine. 
 You see, the brain... it has no nerves. 
 This whole thing is ridiculous. 
 Most of my patients can't even move. 
 You should be happy yours can still get mad. 
 I just don't know what he wants from me. 
 Look, those complaints can haunt you, Shahir. 
 Medicine is like fast food these days. 
 Customer's always right. 
 You should take this seriously. 
 I gotta go. 
 See ya. 
 She's right. 
 Especially if you want to be chief one day. 
 I do want to be chief. 
 Except for the dealing with the people part. 
 But I would just delegate that once I had the power. 
 Ay! Not that I would abuse the power. 
 No, no, no. I would be a benevolent dictator. 
 Something a little bit more nicer... benevolent. 
 That's the key word here. "Benevolent." 
 Dr. Hamza... 
 And if I was your... 
 Why don't you let me help you out? 
 How? 
 Come with me. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 God, that ex-fix is gnarly. 
 I know. I've seen better surgical equipment in the tower of London. 
 (nail clatters) 
 How did he get on a plane with that? 
 How? 'cause he's Thomas Ford, that's how. 
 He's... a maniac. 
 (clatters) So we're doing an above-the-knee amputation? 
 No. We are saving the leg. 
 His mess score is 8. 
 That usually indicates an amputation. 
 I've known this guy since college. 
 We're saving his leg. 
 Okay. Knife. (nail clatters) 
 We'll cut away the infected tissue, irrigate the wounds... (nail clatters) 
 And see what we've got. 
 It's gonna be a long day. 
 Well, my weekend's already shot. 
 (thud) 
 Um, Dr. Harris? 
 Hmm? 
 Maggots. 
 Are you sure you wanna save the leg? 
 (clacks) 
 (wrapper crinkles) 
 (blows air) All right, Diane. 
 This should put pressure on your femoral vein and stop the bleeding. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 And for the record... 
 You know, Alex and I were never married. 
 You seem miserable enough. 
 Well, I asked her once, actually. 
 You did not. 
 What do you mean, I did not? 
 After you passed your board exams, I made you that dinner. 
 You came home, off shift, late... 
 (sighs) threw some noodles on, and asked me if I wanted to get married. 
 No ring. 
 Okay, I was a first year resident. 
 Jack bought a ring from the vending machine. 
 See? Now that's romantic. (sighs) 
 Not... (imitating Joel) "Hey, Alex," 
 "do you want to try the whole marriage thing?" 
 That's not my voice. (laughs) 
 Okay, this is going to hurt, but it's gonna get you better. 
 Okay, you ready? 
 Not really. 
 Here we go. 
 (groaning) That's it. 
 Good job, Diane. 
 It's okay. 
 Hang in there. 
 (groaning continues) That's it, Diane. 
 Ohh! (grunts) 
 There we are. 
 Did it go through? 
 Yeah, you're looking good. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Nice. 
 Here we go. 
 Yeah. 
 (blows air) Very nice. 
 (panting and groaning) Looking good. 
 Another one. 
 Yeah. 
 (grunts) 
 The bleeding stopped, Diane. 
 (crying) Nice work. Look at that. 
 Where's Jack? 
 Okay. I don't know how long it'll hold. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna look for your husband now. 
 Okay, Diane? 
 Mm. 
 You should wait here. 
 Okay. 
 You did a good job. You were very brave. 
 (door bells jingle) 
 Jack?! 
 Jack! 
 Hey! Hey, buddy. Jack. 
 Jack? 
 Jack, can you hear me? 
 Hey... now. (fingers slapping) 
 Can you hear me? 
 (grunting) 
 That's it. That's it. Welcome back. 
 There you go. 
 Kid in an Audi tried to run me over. 
 Actually, it was a Lexus. 
 Whatever it was, he was trying to hit me. 
 Well, I'd say that he succeeded. 
 He didn't hurt Diane, did he? 
 That kid looked shifty. 
 Your wife's gonna be just fine. 
 Tell me something. 
 Does this hurt? 
 Aah! 
 I'll take that as a "yes." (grunts) 
 Can you wiggle your toes? 
 Uh-uh, yeah. 
 But my leg hurts like hell. 
 Is it broken? 
 Yeah, it is. Luckily, you're built like a russian mountain climber, though, so you're probably gonna be fine. 
 Do you have a creeper inside or something? 
 Uh-uh, yeah. 
 All right. 
 Just... I'll be right back, okay? Trust me. (grunts) 
 (weakly) Okay, all right. 
 Stay still. 
 Uh-huh. (groaning) 
 Alex! 
 Hey! 
 Alex : Joel? 
 I found Jack. 
 He's got a broken femur, a concussion, he might even have a spinal fracture. 
 Car threw him at least 10 feet. 
 Can you move him? 
 Well, I can't just leave him out there. 
 How's she doing in there? 
 Hanging in there, barely. 
 You know what we could use right now? 
 An ambulance. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. Let's do some role-playing. 
 Zach will be our patient. 
 Hey, Zach. Do you mind, uh, doing some role-playing with us? 
 Um, sure, yeah. Can I have an eye patch? 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 My patient doesn't have an eye patch. 
 Then no. All right... 
 Okay. Whoa-whoa. 
 What do I got? Like, a brain problem, I guess? 
 A glioma. 
 Yikes. No, I can do that. 
 Okay, what do I do for a living? 
 Oh, you play the piano. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 Am I more like, uh, like Liberace? 
 Or like Billy Joel? 
 Are you-are you asking about your sexuality? 
 No. I'm asking about my style of playing. 
 But wait, am I gay or am I straight? 
 Well, you should know by now. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 You should... 
 Okay, then just riddle me this... am I a thin guy or am I a fat guy? 
 It doesn't matter, De Niro. 
 You're thin, and that's not a riddle. 
 Let's just start. 
 Zach, you be the patient. 
 Okay. 
 Shahir, try to talk to him about his condition. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. (clears throat) 
 What are you doing, Dr. Miller? 
 What... I'm being a thin pianist. 
 (chuckles) 
 It sounds like you said "thin pen1s." 
 Just give him the news. 
  You do. 
 Huh? All right. 
 Give him the news. 
 Mr. Penn, you're gonna die. 
 What? 
 Why? I don't understand. I'm a good Christian. 
 Okay, so make eye contact, speak slowly, use active listening. 
 Don't be afraid to use physical contact. 
 
 
 
 (man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) 
 (clears throat) 
 (clears throat) 
 Well, your... tumor has enveloped your brain stem. 
 I've never seen anyone survive this, ever. 
 I should also mention... perhaps tangentially... that the efficacy of pray in these circumstances has been shown to be of limited benefit. 
 How's that? 
 All right, Jack. We do not have a neck immobilizer, but we do have this... 
 Fine pillow from your wonderful store... $9.95. 
 And I'm gonna duct tape your head to keep it stable. 
 I owe you 5 bucks for that, too, mate. 
 Oh, and the best part is when we take it off, you get a free haircut. 
 Diane likes my hair. 
 Yeah? What else does Diane like? 
 Ah... poker... wine... 
 Public radio. 
 How about you? 
 What kind of music do you like? 
 Uh, classic rock. 
 My dad liked that. 
 Do you like to crank it in the garage when you're working on your cars? 
 Yeah. Diane likes bluegrass. 
 Opposites attract. 
 Yeah. 
 That's how you know you're gonna be with someone, right? 
 'Cause they make you mad? 
 Okay, we're good to go. 
 (grunts) Okay. 
 (vehicle approaching) 
 (grunts) We're gonna be okay. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 You just gotta listen to my voice. 
 We're gonna get you guys out of this. 
 Okay. (exhales) 
 Anything? 
 Nothing. 
 (both exhale sharply) 
 (grunts) 
 Okay, let's get him inside. 
 This is gonna be a bumpy ride. 
 Okay. 
 Just hold tight, buddy. 
 Okay. 
 (wheels clacking) 
 (grunting) 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 I think I got 'em all. 
 And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I gave up composting. 
 And the presence of maggots in the wound means what, Dr. Lin? 
 That the patient delayed seeking treatment. 
 That the patient's leg is severely infected. (object clacks) 
 That the patient has a very high pain threshold. 
 Basically, your friend is a superhero. 
 I mean, this guy is insane, right? 
 There's a bunch of metal artifact from old wounds in here. 
 Shrapnel, probably. (clinks) 
 Is-is that a bullet? 
 Yeah. 
 (monitor beeps) 
 (tape ripples) 
 They fixed you up good, Jack. 
 (strained voice) Yeah. 
 Well, your husband's got a cardboard splint. 
 And I got blood all over your blanket. 
 So you might want to reserve judgment. 
 You hanging in okay, sweetness? 
 Yep. 
 I'm doing good. 
 Joel. 
 Yeah. 
 He didn't get the lockbox. 
 Jack : You know how much was in there? 
 No. 
 85 bucks. 
 Nearly got us killed for less than 100 bucks. 
 (chuckles) That's love. 
 Alex : Hi, this is Dr. Alex Reid. 
 My colleague called at least an hour ago. 
 We're at the gas station on concession road 4. 
 I've got a G.S.W. and a man who was run over by a car here. 
 We need help. Any kind of help would be great. 
 No. I-I'm not yelling. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's the ambulance? 
 On its way to town with our meth head in it. 
 He crashed your car. 
 Okay. So... are they sending another ambulance? 
 Yeah, from Cobourg. 
 That's two hours away. 
 Hey. 
 Diane? 
 Diane? 
 What's going on? 
 Her shock is getting worse. 
 And... abracadabra. 
 An antibiotic nail. 
 That's right. 
 Now it sounds like exactly what it is. 
 We hammer this into the tibial canal, it stabilizes the fracture and fights the infection at the same time. 
 Neat. 
 Now clean this up and expose the screw holes. 
 Got it. 
 Hey, is this your pal with the, uh, iron maiden on his leg? 
 Yeah, word travels fast, huh? 
 Oh, my god. 
 What the hell happened to him? 
 Bit of a long story, Dana. 
 Well, you want me to put a free flap on that? 
 That is the plan, Dana, yep. 
 Oh, wow. 
 I wished you'd called before I came down, 'cause there's no way. 
 Well, I can't just leave it exposed. 
 Yeah, but to put in a free flap, I have to borrow muscle from the other leg, leaving a big hole. 
 And then, say the flap doesn t take, gets infected. 
 Now the guy's got two bad legs. 
 Or it goes the other way. 
 And the healthy muscle helps mobilize the antibiotics, and helps fight the infection better. Mallet. 
 (clanking) 
 Jesus, Charlie. The leg's a goner. 
 Cut it off! 
 (clanking stops) 
 (sighs) Anybody else smell smoke? 
 (Dana) Charlie, you have to amputate. Face it. 
 (sighs) 
 Dana, I know the patient, and we have to try. 
 You want me to cut a piece off his good leg and sew it onto the bad leg. 
 And if it doesn't take, you're just prolonging his suffering. 
 Suffering, he can handle. 
 It's kind of his thing. 
 If you go down this road, there's no turning back. You're committed. 
 So no more bikini contests. He'll get over that. 
 Dana, every major decision I've made in my life, I've asked this guy's advice. 
 He's like a brother to me. 
 I owe him this. So... help me. 
 (monitors beeping) 
 (sighs) All right. 
 Thank you. 
 Put in the locking screws and dress the wound. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (glove snaps) 
 Her pulse is 130. 
 And she's unconscious. 
 She must still be bleeding out. 
 Check it. 
 (whispers) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 (normal voice) No. The tamponade is still holding, But she's lost a lot of blood. 
 There's at least 2 liters on the floor here. 
 Yeah, she needs fluids. 
 She needs blood. 
 Yeah, she does. 
 I'm O-negative. Universal donor. 
 And she can have my blood. 
 I-I can... just give us a second while we figure this out, Jack. 
 No, why don't you stop talking and do something? 
 Okay, we will do something about it, Jack. 
 Just... why don't you just hold your wife's hand for-for a second while I talk to Dr. Reid? 
 Come talk to me. 
 Alex, are you seriously talking about doing a live transfusion? 
 It could save her life. 
 Yeah, or not. 
 Either way, you are out of your mind. 
 Well, she's gonna die if she doesn't get some fluids in her. 
 And a root beer out of the fridge isn't gonna do it. 
 Okay, you're talking about cutting into your wrist, okay, the cephalic vein. Now you are a surgeon. 
 Okay, you're a magnificent surgeon. 
 Your hands are your life. 
 Aren't we supposed to help people, Joel? 
 Isn't that why we're surgeons? 
 But if you cut a tendon, or if you cut an artery, you might not be able to operate again. 
 Well, I won't, if I'm such a good surgeon. 
 Now I need something that I can use as a needle. 
 Alex, I'm telling you, this is a terrible idea. 
 I know it is. 
 So help me. 
 (groans) 
 Would you like me to turn this TV on? 
 (strained voice) No. 
 I can get a volunteer to come in and get you some juice, maybe a magazine... 
 Is it just me, or are you talking... really loud? 
 It's quite normal after brain surgery for things to seem very noisy and bright. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 (telephone ringing in distance) 
 How are you feeling? 
 Terrible. 
 I hear you saying, "you feel terrible." 
 I feel like somebody just... banged my head against the ground. 
 Mm-hmm. I hear you saying, "you feel like somebody" 
 "has banged your head against the..." 
 (sighs) Stop. 
 Dr. Hamza. I... 
 I complained about your bedside manner because you seemed completely unaware that I was a human being... with feelings. But this is... 
 This is worse. 
 I just-I just don't know how to be. 
 Just be yourself. 
 Well, I have very bad news. 
 The surgery didn't go as well as I'd hoped. 
 We weren't able to remove all of the tumor. 
 And I just find people so confusing sometimes. 
 I get it. (whispers) I get it. 
 Tell me about your humming. 
 I-I've heard you humming. 
 What? This? 
 (humming) 
 Hmm. 
 "Gymnopédie no. 1" by Erik Satie. 
 I've always preferred Mozart. More notes. 
 My life's work so far has been recording all of Satie's piano pieces, but... 
 I don't think I'm going to get around to this one. 
 You may. Hmm? 
 You have a month. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 I, um... 
 (voice breaking) I think I'm gonna close my eyes for a moment, if you don't mind. 
 (clicks) Hey, man... you can't smoke in here. 
 (clicks) Dude, I'm a ghost. 
 Well, I... heard your real lungs. 
 So... just do me a favor. Don't. 
 (sighs) 
 Lay it on me. 
 What? 
 The... advice. 
 Come on, man. You've been telling me what to do since we were, what, 19 years old? 
 So, what do I do about... this? 
 What, seeing ghosts? 
 Yeah. 
 You might have finally stumped me, Charles. 
 (chuckles) Kinda being serious this time. 
 I could use some help. 
 Okay, look. I don't, uh... 
 I don't know what's happening here. 
 But, uh... it is mind-blowingly cool, Charlie. 
 So my advice... my advice is to embrace it. 
 Use it. 
 How? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 If it was me... 
 Rwanda, Kosovo, Sierra Leone. 
 Kids and mothers being murdered coldheartedly. 
 Enter Charlie. 
 You talk to the spirits, you find out what happened. 
 You get names, ranks. 
 You see what I'm saying here, Charlie? 
 The wrongs that you could make right. 
 This-this-this is... huge, man. 
 I'll think about it. 
 No. Unh-unh. 
 That means no. 
 Say yes. 
 Thomas... 
 Boom! Yes! Me and you kickin' ass! 
 (pager buzzes) 
 Ah, I love this. You're gonna love this. 
 Oh, look. I have to get back to your surgery. 
 Mm. 
 Okay, so, I will do the saphenous cut-down on Diane's ankle. 
 And then I'll cut myself. We need to make sure she doesn't get an air embolism. 
 And I'll wait to cannulate until the tube's been primed. 
 Perfect. Once it has... drip, drip, drip. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, She could reject your blood. 
 We'll know within the first few minutes. 
 'Cause she'll die. 
 Or she'll bleed out and die 15 minutes from now. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's do it. 
 Yep. 
 (knife clatters) 
 Here we go. 
 (knife clatters) 
 You're both gonna go septic from this, you know that, right? 
 Sterility in trauma is a luxury. 
 Besides... that ambulance is just a few minutes away. 
 (gasps) 
 (knife thuds) 
 (exhales sharply and groans) Okay. 
 We've got some flow. 
 (objects clatter) Yes. 
 Okay. 
 And tube's primed. (object clatters) 
 (tape rips) 
 How about I count down two minutes? 
 If she makes it through this, we're gold. 
 (exhales) 
 Okay. She seems stable. 
 You know, this is more fun than giving my presentation on diaphragmatic repair. 
 Well, it's a little bit more interesting. 
 Just saying. 
 What, that I'm not a scintillating public speaker? 
 You kind of have this, uh... 
 It's like this adorable clumsiness whenever you get nervous. 
 And... time. 
 Alex : It's working. 
 Is she gonna be okay? 
 She's hanging in there, Jack. 
 (crying) 
 Okay? 
 (voice breaks) Yeah. 
 Okay. The minute that pulse hits 100, I'm gonna take that tube out of you. 
 Then, young lady, we're gonna find you a juice and a delicious cookie. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Hey. 
 Shouldn't you be at home? 
 I can't. 
 I feel... 
 (sighs) something. 
 What are you still doing here? 
 I'm waiting for Maggie to get out of surgery. 
 Right. 
 So, things go badly with your patient? 
 Yes. 
 Ever since Victor and I broke up, I haven't replaced him. 
 It's okay to be single. 
 No. I mean... 
 Look, I get a lot of sexual "sugar," like you say. 
 I just haven't found... 
 I haven't found love. 
 As stifling as love is. 
 But you're happy. Doesn't matter. 
 My point is, my patient today told me, you know, just to be myself. 
 So what if that means I can never be close to people? 
 Hmm? 
 Uh... eh... sit... further away. 
 (inhales, exhales) 
 Shahir, love and closeness are feelings, but they consist of gestures. 
 What we do matters the most. 
 So then why bother with your stupid exercises? 
 Hmm? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. How was the surgery? 
 Maggots. Bullets. Rotting flesh. 
 It was, uh, it was amazing. 
 Do you own anything camo? 
 I have some green socks. 
 Hmm. 
 I want you to put them on and tell me about how much you hate war. 
 I actually do hate war. 
 That's great. Um... but say it like you have a bullet in your leg. 
 Aah! I hate war! 
 Yeah. I can work with that. 
 Uh... so-so the socks are your gesture? 
 In this case, yeah. 
 Dana : Nice work, everyone. 
 Well, looks like you made the right call. 
 I think that flap's gonna take. 
 (fist thuds) 
 Thank you, Dana. 
 Sure. 
 (cell phone vibrates) 
 Mm. 
 Charlie Harris. 
 Okay. Well, I think you've made... 
 I think you've made a mistake, but... 
 Thank you. 
 Everything okay? 
 It appears that, uh, Thomas Ford is not insured. 
 Ooh. Too much time out of the country, huh? 
 Yeah, that, and he's unemployed. 
 I thought he got hurt on assignment. 
 Me, too. 
 Ah. 
 How you feeling? 
 Little woozy, to be honest. 
 Pulse is 95. I'm calling it, okay? 
 Mm. 
 Why don't you get some rest? I got this. 
 Sounds good. 
 (inhales, exhales) 
 Oh, pain bite. 
 (exhales) 
 Pain. 
 Morphine pump. Squeeze. 
 You big baby. 
 (telephone ringing in distance, monitor beeping steadily) 
 (beeps) 
 You know, you're welcome for saving your leg. 
 Thank you. 
 You know if you're in trouble, I can help you, right? 
 You know, huh? 
 Yep. 
 Yeah, I called the magazine, and they told me they... fired you. 
 What happened? 
 (exhales) It's nothing. 
 It was time to move on. 
 The whole thing was blown out of proportion. 
 Was it drugs? 
 Come on, man. 
 (laughs) 
 Then... what? 
 Two guys were about to set another guy on fire. 
 I told them to "stop, don't do this." 
 They laughed. 
 So I shot one of them. 
 Well... you got a shot at what? 
 No. 
 I shot a man. I killed him. 
 Jesus, Ford. 
 I've seen hundreds of people killed. 
 They always come up to me, you know, as they're dying. 
 "Help me." 
 And I take a step back, get the picture. 
 I'm half-in, I'm half-out. I... 
 I finally had to pick a side. 
 Anyway, I'm freelancing now. It's better. 
 You should come with me, Charles. 
 You ever seen Angola? Huh? 
 Next time, huh? 
 (chuckles) Yeah. Right. 
 Hey, uh, grab my camera in there, will ya? 
 Thanks. 
 (beeps) 
 Get over here. 
 No. 
 Come on. Get your ugly mug over here. 
 Say "cheese." 
 Cheese. 
 (beeps, shutter clicks) 
 (laughs) 
 Dude, you look like a ghost, man. 
 (beeps) 
 (humming) 
 You got some more bad news for me, doctor? 
 Actually, I'm going to do something for you. 
 For me? 
 More for me. Either way. 
 Now, let's get you out of this. 
 Wow, you are really hooked up here, aren't you? 
 Let's call a nurse. 
 Nurse! 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Okay, so I know you're probably used to Steinways, but this is the best I could do. 
 I don't really feel up for a concert. 
 No, I'm gonna play for you. 
 (clears throat) 
 You don't have to do this. 
 You know, my mother made me take lessons when I was a kid. 
 At first, I thought it was a curse, then in med school, It was kind of a respite from talking to patients. 
 Okay. So I have to warn you, I'm, uh, really... really rusty. Hmm. 
 (playing Satie's "Gymnopédies no. 1") 
 ♪ 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 ♪ 
♪ 
 Okay. So? 
 How was it? 
 Truth? Hmm? 
 It was, um... it was pretty bad. 
 But it was also, um... 
 (voice breaking) it was also pretty great. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm officially withdrawing my complaint. 
 (whispers) Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, I still think you should let the E.R. docs keep you overnight. 
 Hell, no. 
 That was the purest I've felt in a long time. 
 You know, just acting on instinct. 
 Not thinking, just doing. 
 Yep. 
 We made a good team. 
 This is me. 
 Yes. It is. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Yeah? 
 Uh, you should probably... you should probably change the, uh, bandages before you go to bed. 
 Just... I don't want the hand getting infected. 
 Right. Thanks. 
 (beep, lock clicks) 
 (switch clicks)
