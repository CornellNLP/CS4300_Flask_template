 It's a cat with a piece of bread around its head. 
 I know. It's called breading. 
 It's totally super cute and weird. 
 People put bread around their cats' heads and then take pictures. 
 Why? What? How? 
 Hey, Dr. Goran, you're cutting. 
 You talking to me? 
 (loudly) Yes, Dr. Joel Goran. 
 There are all these people waiting in line for coffee. 
 What-what makes you think you can cut ahead? 
 I didn't know there was a line. 
 Well, now you do. 
 Could you tell? 
 What? 
 I totally have a crush on that guy. 
 Was I acting all shy and giddy? 
 I get like that with guys I like. 
 You were acting rude. 
 Or I get the opposite. I don't know. 
 I don't know how I act. 
 Charlie : I used to be the chief of surgery. 
 Now I'm two guys. 
 One is in coma. 
 The other is invisible. He is so not that guy. I can get the nurses to find you a cot, you know. Chair's great. I'm becoming one of those square Japanese watermelons. (chuckles) Honestly, it's totally good, Mel. Alex, O.R. nurse called. They're looking for you down there. (sighs, whispers) Damn it. Of course they are. Alex, do me a favor. Let people be nice to you. Don't do that. Don't make me cry, because if I start, I won't be able to stop. And that's not a joke. Hey, Alex. Can't talk, Joel. Dr. Kinney's looking for you. I'm late for the O.R. Hey, is that coffee? Take it. It's not that fermented stuff you drink? Kombucha? No. It's not. It's coffee. Thank god. Hey, how's Charlie? No change. Oh, man, really? Good luck. Nice haircut. Thank you. Dr. Kinney. Congrats on being made chief of surgery. Interim chief. The minute Charlie opens those baby blues, I'm out. How's he doing? He's doing fine. Mm-hmm. Well, it's only been three days. Not catastrophic. If there's no changes in three weeks, then, you know, you're up a creek. The patient needs a tumor removed from her adrenal gland. We'll go in laparoscopically. Hey, Victor, you see the game? I saw linebackers. Why is Reycraft scrubbing into my O.R.? He's doing the surgery. Mrs. Sopinka's my patient. Yeah, but you're late. You may be chief surgical resident, but I'm not your boyfriend. No special treatment, Reid. Get to your rounds. She threw a clamp at me once. All the nurses think she's got a peen. (chuckles) I'm just saying, we all miss Dr. Harris. You can tell him that when he wakes up. (man speaking indistinctly) (monitor beeping steadily) (indistinct conversations) Zach. Hey. What do you got for me? Uh, Kym Spencer, 23 years old, fell off her bike, broke her leg. It's pretty bad. How bad? Open tib fib. Nice. See how excited you get? Oh, I'm excited. Oh, hey, she's, uh, refusing pain meds. Okay. Hey, Kym? Hi. I'm Dr. Goran. Uh, look, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Can you feel your leg? (voice breaking) Yeah. All right, can you feel it when I touch your foot like that... Can you not touch her, please? You know what? I'd really prefer a female doctor, actually. Well, I'm the doctor on call. And believe me, I'm your guy. Are we cool? Yeah. Okay, can you feel your foot, Kym? All right, you have a compound fracture, and we need to take some X-rays, and then we're gonna... (crying) What, is it your shoulder? Yeah. All right. (sobbing) (groans) All right, let's get her some I.V. antibiotics and give her a tetanus shot. Also, let's get a general surgeon to take a look at her. Okay, I'll take care of it. All right, I got this. Whoa. Is it bad? I mean, is it... is it bad? It's bad, isn't it? I'm just being thorough, okay? It's okay. Woman : I don't know how long he's gonna be here, so can you bring some, uh, underwear and some socks in case and, uh, also can you feed the fish? That would help. Cal, how many pinches of food? Two pinches. Two pinches of food. Right. And can you clean... This is Cal's third visit to Hope-Zee this month. He's got diarrhea, so we're hydrating him. Some abdominal pain. How's the ultrasound? I didn't see anything on it. Chest and abdo X-ray. C.B.C. and lytes, L.F.T.S and enzymes... nothing. Cal, the blood pressure cuff is just gonna hug your arm. Okay? Okay. Cal, you've been having a lot of stomachaches? Yeah. Yeah? Have you been eating anything weird? No. Is anything bugging you at school or... Mm, no. Give him an M.R. Cal, that's a picture that's gonna let us see what's really going on in that belly of yours. Your dad's on his way, okay, buddy? Okay. Cal, focus. Stop touching me! I just need you to... ow. Ow. Ow! Ow! Cal! Are you okay? He bit me! I am so sorry. He's not normally like this. Cal, you can't do that, buddy. He's really out of control right now. Shut up! This is not like him. It's okay. We're gonna make you better. That little zombie better not have hep-C. His diarrhea's not trending up. That was a joke. "Trending up"? (scoffs) Why can't you residents just talk like people? Here. You need to sign this. Can you give 2 acetaminophen to the guy in 237? Woman : Sure. I'll do a psych assessment for Cal if you'd like. His parents are getting a divorce, so he's  loco. That's my assessment. Now I'm going home. Ay-yi-yi. Why would someone so mean become a pediatrician? You're sane, and you're a shrink. Yeah, but I have my neuroses. I don't like thick drinks. You're afraid of milkshakes. Yeah, and spiders and heights and caves. Can't have my foods touch. Raccoons freak me out with the  hands. (chuckles) I think a lot about the end of the world, and I wish I was better with women, socially and... sexually. (scoffs) Uh... Dr. Reid? (button clicks) If you ever need to talk to anyone... I realize that sounds like I mean sexually 'cause of what I just said. Just asking. Drop this bad boy off for me. Thank you. Is that who I think it is? Yep. Charlie's ex-wife. This is what I love about you, Alex. You face things. You walk  towards  trouble. You look it right in the eye, and when you have to, you fight. Dawn, how are you? I'm devastated. How are you? Well, you know, it's... it's been weird, Dawn. (monitor beeping steadily) Oh. Just, I was in town for the day, and... so I thought that I, um... I'll just shut up. Oh, this is awkward. No, you're... you're here to see Charlie. That's great. I just need to change his I.V. and suction his phlegm. Nurses do that, usually. Makes me feel closer to him. Right. Uh, can I ask? Has Charlie been started on coma arousal therapy? We're doing everything we can for Charlie. Yeah, well, can I tell you about coma arousal therapy? You expose the patient to extreme physical stimuli... smells like rubbing alcohol, touch like deep massage, sexual stimulation. I've... heard about it. Well, wouldn't it be worth trying? Studies show it doesn't make any difference in patient awareness. Right. We're doing everything, Dawn. No, you're doing everything that you know how to do. That's not the same thing. You can reduce the sedation, give him zolpidem. There's coma arousal therapy, There's transcranial magnetic stimulation. There's acupuncture... Those are all unproven. Well, I would think that you would try anything. I know that I would. Well, there it is, then... your second opinion, whether you want it... or not. You. You're my consult. That's right. Okay. I am Maggie Lin. I'm a third year surgical resident. You might remember me from this morning when you cut in line for coffee. Although you have such a god complex, you probably don't remember me at all. (chuckles) No, I definitely remember who you are. Don't worry about that. Come with me. I... would... say... you have a... a ruptured spleen. But her shoulder hurts. It's a common symptom. It's called Kehr's sign. Right, but before we can deal with that, I'm gonna have to set this leg temporarily. Kym, its gonna hurt... a lot. We'll get you some morphine... No. No drugs. Well, hold her hand, then. Dr. Lin, I'm gonna need you for counter-pressure. You done this before? Once. That's enough. All right, place your hands above the knee. Please. And we pull back on the count of three. One... two... three. (bones crunching) Aah! (screaming loudly) (curtain rings swoosh) We're gonna get you into an ultrasound and get you into surgery ASAP. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Surgery? We need to remove her spleen. Does that involve a blood transfusion? Yes. She can't have it, then. What are you talking about? She's bleeding internally. She needs to be transfused. Our religion forbids blood transfusions, okay? I'm sorry. She can't. (crying) (siren wailing in distance) Hey, Cal. Hey. So you going home, then? Yeah, my dad's getting the car. You feeling better? Uh... I guess so. Hey, do you mind if I sit down? I mean, you're not gonna bite me, are you? Did your pediatrician diagnose you? I mean, did, uh, did she say you had something, like a tummy ache or the flu? Uh, no. She just said it was one of those things. Cal? What are you feeling, Cal? I don't know... (breathing heavily) Does your stomach hurt? No. Is it hard to breathe? Are you having a hard time breathing? Yeah. (panting) Okay, Cal. I feel dizzy. Cal. Cal! (people gasp) Cal, open your eyes. I need the code team! Code blue! Code blue! (P.A. beeps) woman : Code blue... (speaking indistinctly) Let's go! Let's go! He's V.S.A. Didn't we already admit this kid? Yeah, he got discharged. Start a wide bore I.V. and give him a liter. All right, expose his chest. Get the leads on him. When did he code? Under five. Hold C.P.R. He crashed in the atrium. Get me an oropharyngeal. (fabric rips) All right, get it started. E.C.G. showing some activity. P.E.A. resume, resume. (monitor beeping erratically) Keep bagging him. We gotta get his pressure back up. (monitor beeping rapidly) He's going V-fib. Prep the panels. Come on, Cal. 360 joules. How are we doing on that line? Working on it. Run that bolus. Get me epi. Woman : Withdrawing epi. Kid? Can you see me? (man's voice echoing indistinctly) (woman, faintly) Check pulse. (man's voice continues echoing indistinctly) (whispers) Hey, buddy, let's go. (defibrillator whines) Clear! (beeps) (woman speaks indistinctly) (paddles thunk) Still no pulse. Woman : All clear? Let's go again. Clear! (thunk, beeps) Nothing. (woman, faintly) All clear. (defibrillator whines) (thunk) (defibrillator whines) All clear. Clear. (paddles thunk) (monitor beeping steadily) Sinus rhythm. (sighs) Holy hell. Hey, Cal. How is it? I am gonna need to speak with my colleague. (scoffs) Well, she's gonna be okay, right? Kym, you really need this surgery. No blood. There are clotting agents she can have, right? Of proconvertin? Unfortunately, she's bleeding so much that none of that will help. Well... (sighs) well, what can you do? I really need to consult with a more senior doctor. Fine.

Now will you please stop touching him? ♪ (music stops) Well, somebody has to. What does that mean? I see you doing all this nursemaidy stuff for him, but what are you doing for him as his wife? I'm his fiancée. You know what I mean. 72 hours. Look at him, Alex. The Charlie that I know would rather die. (man speaks indistinctly) Woman : Do you have a clear view? To the left. (woman speaks indistinctly) Disagree. Dr. Lin, what's up? Dr. Goran, there's a lot of free fluid in Kym's abdomen. How bad's her spleen? Well, as far as I can tell, it's shattered. She has about an hour and a half before she bleeds out. Well, please keep her comfortable. That's it? Yeah, or page me if there's any problems with her leg. Well, there's gotta be something that we can do. We can't just let her die because she won't have a transfusion. Well, we don't have a choice. So you don't care? Of course I care, but if she doesn't consent, there's really very little we can do. We could talk to the hospital ethicist. Yeah, maybe he could bore her into having the surgery. You're such an ass. I've seen this kind of thing before, all right? I did a fellowship in Mexico city, and I've seen more than a few patients refuse blood on religious grounds. So you're just gonna let her slip away? Keep her hydrated. You went to med school in Mexico? Figures. I went to Harvard. Figures. Cal is very sick, but don't worry. I'll figure it all out. He has a heart problem? Not necessarily. I-I don't understand. I mean, he came in here with diarrhea, and then he stops breathing. We should have brought him in sooner. You were the one who wanted to wait. Kids can crash really quickly. Here's the thing. I need to operate on Cal. His belly is distended, and this is new. It could be a bowel obstruction. But I thought you said you didn't know what he had. I don't, exactly. Well, what about all those tests that you did? I mean... We didn't seen anything at the time. Things progress. I gonna have to do what's called an exploratory laparotomy. I actually have to go in to see what's causing his system to crash. Couldn't that make him worse? This is our next step. He practically died. Why are you questioning the doctor? Are you kidding me? I'm just asking a question. You always think that you know everything. This is not the time to question him. We need to get him better! Stop fighting! (monitor beeping erratically) Dr. Reid, B.P.'s falling. B.P.'s 80. He's tachycardic. Open the valve and push fluids into him. He's what? What-what does that mean? You need to move. Can you tell me what that means, please? Come on, Cal. Don't you dare code on me again. Cal? Cal, baby, can you hear me? You need to be out of here. Can you please get them out of here? Can you hear me, baby? Please tell us what's going on. I'm right here, baby. I-I understand. What is happening? You gotta let the doctor do her work, all right? Please. Somebody get me the crash cart!

When people... patients... die here at Hope Zion, they, um, they stick around for a while. So... you're a dead guy? No. No, I'm in a coma. Kind of a special case, I guess. Well, what's a coma? Uh, it's like being asleep. Sort of. Just a very, very deep sleep. So do you hang out with the dead people? (chuckles) Uh, not really. See, they, uh, they stick around, then they leave. Well, where did they go? I don't know. I haven't quite got to that part yet. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm not saying you will, pal. I wanna go back to my parents. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. I wanna see my mom, and I want my dad to see me. Okay. Okay, I understand. Hey, you came back from the dead once, right? Yeah, but... So no big deal. Wanna see a dead body? Okay. Cool! Let's go. (drawer slides) Where's that guy's ghost? (clank) Oh, he's around here somewhere. Don't worry. Most of the people I've met around here are actually pretty nice. Hey, let's, uh, let's talk about you. Why don't you tell me about your symptoms? Are you a doctor? Yep. You don't look like a doctor. Yeah, not all the time. Come on. Tell me what's been going on. Maybe we can, uh... figure this thing out together. I've been getting stomachaches and diarrhea. Yeah? What else? Come on. Anything. Your toe hurt? No. Okay, we'll overlook toe cancer, then. What about, uh, how you're feeling in here? You mad? You sad? Happy? I don't know. I've been getting mad. I bit my doctor. Dr. Rundle, the pediatrician? Good for you. She can be kinda mean. And my parents are getting a divorce. Yeah? And they're all like, "now you have two homes." But I liked it better when they were together, and they fight all the time 'cause of me. Buddy, they don't fight because of you. They do. They were happy till I started getting sick. Cal, I don't think you could make your parents unhappy. You hear me? And if your parents are getting a divorce, that's not your fault. Okay? Don't you ever think that. Cal, you're flushing. What? I know what's wrong with you. Come on. (breathing heavily) Come on. (beeping rapidly) We have a pulse. Cal? Cal? Buddy, you are a cat with nine lives. Look at his face. He's flushing. She's got it. It's the pathognomic symptom for a carcinoid syndrome. Check his 5-H.I.A.A. now. Cal? Good news. I know what's wrong with you. (monitor beeping steadily) I'll see you around, Cal. Her pressure's dropping. She's tachy at 140, and she's sweating buckets. You want me to talk to her? She's restless and anxious. How are her S.A.T.S.? Lousy. Okay. (breathing erratically) Hi, Kym. (curtain rings swoosh) I wanna get up and walk around. Does that mean she's getting better? No. It means she's in hypovolemic shock. Kym, I need you to lie flat. We're gonna give you some saline solution to increase your blood pressure. I'm getting up. Kym, I'm just gonna elevate your legs now. I don't... I can't feel my body. I'm dying. No, no. You need to rest. Pray with me. Please pray with me. (crying) Please pray with me. I wanna get... I wanna get up. No, no, no. I wanna get up. Just let me... I don't feel good. I can't feel my body. I'm dying. I'm dying. Pray-pray-pray with... pray with me! (hyperventilating) Would you do something for her?! It's up to you, man. Your wife's lost almost 40% of her blood volume. She's losing so much blood, that there's not enough to get back to her heart. (Kym breathing heavily) Is she dying? Sorry, Aaron. Yes, she is. (whispers indistinctly) Please. (crying) It's okay. (kisses) I love you. (kisses) Give her the surgery. Give me 2 units of O-neg, and get Aaron here to sign a consent form. Aaron, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to stay behind. Go scrub. O.R. three. Okay. You did the right thing. (doors squeak) Cal has cancer? I think he has a rare kind of tumor called a carcinoid. Well, what does that mean? It's a tumor that secretes hormones. And his system has been going crazy because the hormones dump into his bloodstream. That's why he's flushing, why he's moody and bit Dr. Rundle. Okay, so now that you know this, I mean, he's gonna be okay, right? We just need to remove the tumors. Can I, uh... can I ask, is this our fault somehow? Paul, please. No, it's-it's nobody's fault. It's... we're doing the best we can, okay? But we don't always see eye to eye, and-and, you know, you know what I mean. Just, he doesn't even have his own bedroom at my place. And I get really upset sometimes, and he sees it made him... I am not blaming this on you, okay, at all. You obviously love your son very much. You didn't make him sick. I know you're worried, but you're in the right place. We will take very good care of him. Now a nurse will take you down to an O.R. waiting room. I'll see you soon. Thank you. Okay. You didn't seem the least bit surprised when Aaron changed his mind. Ah, it's a man's prerogative. There were 2 units of O-neg  conveniently  waiting in the room, and you had an O.R. on standby. You knew the entire time that he wouldn't let his wife die, didn't you? (scrubbing hands) Why do you keep staring at me like that? 'Cause I can't decide whether you're insane or a genius. How did you know the husband would cave? I didn't, really. I thought he... might... probably. You could have told me. Well, then you wouldn't have learned anything, and this is a teaching hospital. I am sickened by you and also totally turned on. Maggie. (water running) I'm just kidding. You're gonna observe my surgery, right? Maggie, I feel like you have a crush on me, and it makes me uncomfortable. I do not have a crush on you. Good. But I'd do you. Goran, you're, uh, ortho. What gives? Yeah, I'm observing today. Ah. Dr. Lin's extremely persistent. Yeah, she's earned this surgery, so, uh, let her have this one, okay? Sure. I always wanted to give Lin a splenectomy. Dude, that doesn't even make sense. Think about it. (siren wailing in distance) Are we doing everything we can for Charlie? Yes. What about reducing his sedation and giving him zolpidem? I've tried that already. Coma arousal therapy? That's a flaky thing. (scribbling) (scoffs) Transcranial magnetic stimulation? That is ridiculous. Who's been talking to you about this? Charlie's ex-wife. Dawn bell? Alex, she's a cardiologist. She doesn't know a thing about comas. This... this is neuro. Why isn't Charlie waking up? (clears throat) Comas... are mysterious. And that's coming from someone who has an intricate knowledge of the brain. I need a mochaccino. You should be careful of Dawn. How so? Hmm. You're not married to Charlie. You really should be his legal decision maker in case things drag out. I've seen it before. (monitor beeping steadily, suction gurgling) (reycraft) Now, Maggie, I want you to reach in and cut the spleen with your hand. Now gently lift it towards the midline. Excellent. Clamping. Cut the hilum of the spleen. (snip) Now you can remove the spleen, and I'll tie off the splenic vessels. All right. I need suction. (under breath) That's what she said. (suction gurgling) (monitor beeping rhythmically) Okay. (monitor beeping erratically) You've got to be kidding me. He's crashing. He's having a carcinoid crisis. The tumor's dumping hormones. He needs octreotide, 100 micrograms. (monitor beeping rapidly) (monitor emitting continuous tone) He's asystolic. Come on, kid. Cal, I am not gonna let you freakin' die. Cal : Hey, Charlie. Charlie : Hey, Cal. Check it out. Listen, Cal, I don't think we have much time. I need you to do a big favor for me. Okay, sure. You see Dr. Reid? I need you to send a message to her from me. Can you do that? Yep. Just tell her you saw me. Just-just tell her that I love her. Can you do that, buddy? Yep. (monitor beeps) I got a pressure. He's back at normal sinus rhythm. He's back. God, kid, you are amazing. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Okay. (siren wailing in distance) (knocks on doorframe) Hi. Hi. How'd the kid go? Really well. Yeah? Good. Are we gonna have a problem, Dana? Well, I wasn't aware we had a problem now. I didn't get the job of chief surgical resident because of Charlie. I got it because I work hard and I'm good at what I do. Yeah, sure. I don't expect special treatment, but unless I screw up, I'm gonna need you to treat me with respect. Then don't screw up. (monitor beeping steadily) Hey, Cal, how are you feeling? (raspy voice) Better. Yeah? Well, it looks like you're gonna be okay. We took out all those tumors. Cool. What you drawing? I don't know, but it's just hard drawing with this. You know what? I think it looks pretty good. Can I see it? Yeah. Yeah. Who's that? That's me. It's pretty realistic. Thanks. What about the guy in the suit? Is that your dad? No. My dad would never wear a suit. Hmm. Is that a bow tie? Yeah. That... that's a bow tie. But it's undone. Hmm. Who's the guy in the bow tie? He has... I don't really remember. Everything okay, Dr. Reid? Yeah. Cal's doing really well. You've got a little fighter on your hands. Yes, I do. I will check on you later. Thank you. Yeah. (speaking indistinctly) (gasps) (mutters) Cal? Yeah? Do you think I could have this? I mean, would you mind? It would mean a lot to me. Sure. Here. Thank you. You're welcome. It's a really bad idea. It's a really good idea. It's a bad idea. Good. (grunts and laughs) It's a bad idea. But it feels good. Yes, it does. Is good. Okay, look. I'm not up for a relationship. Oh, please shut up. (thud) (sighs) Does the door lock? No. (thud) (monitor beeping steadily) Think fast. Mmm, ham and cheese. Straight from the vending machine, the way you like it. Thanks. Do you believe in ghosts? No. Why? This is gonna sound insane. Okay? But the kid I was operating on today... He... he drew a picture of a guy wearing a tux just like the one Charlie was wearing on our wedding day before the crash. So? So... Honey, lots of people wear a tux... James Bond, Mr. Peanut. Charlie's not a ghost, because he's not dead. Yeah, it's-it's stupid. I just... it felt like a nice idea that he... I just... I wanted a... I wanted to  feel that he might... Forget it. Forget it. Come out for a glass of wine. Do you good. No. No, I'm good. I'm fine. Okay. Favorite song. Who has a favorite song?
