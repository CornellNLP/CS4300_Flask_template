 Charlie? 
 (exhales) 
 You expecting someone else? 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 But, Charlie, just... lately I feel like there's this distance between us. 
 Charlie? 
 (gasps, exhales sharply) 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 (exhales deeply) 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (both speaking indistinctly) 
 Gettin' off? 
 What? No! Yes, sorry. 
 I fell asleep in the call room. 
 Weird dream. 
 Mm, weird. Now I want details. 
 Forget about it. 
 Hearing other people's dreams is like trying to listen to the daily special at a restaurant. 
 People just glaze over. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Hey... 
 How are you doing? 
 Good. Thank you. 
 Nice suit. 
 Thank you. Yeah, I'm, uh, supposed to do this photo shoot for the, uh, hospital newsletter. 
 Spotlight on the chief. 
 I just hate having my picture taken, you know? 
 Key to a good photo... 
 (cell phone buzzing) think of a secret. 
 I don't have any secrets. 
 (buzzing continues) Luke called. 
 What's he want? 
 He's speaking tomorrow at a sunrise meeting. 
 Invited us, so... 
 I wouldn't miss that. 
 I gotta take this. Sorry. 
 (speaks indistinctly) It's his testimonial. 
 He's gonna be telling a room full of strangers all about my crazy family. 
 I'll be right there beside you. 
 You do make good army candy. 
 Eh. 
 Is there anything in my teeth? 
 Why? You got a hot date? 
 No. I have my own camera to worry about. 
 Okay, you have one more cup of coffee, we're gonna have to get out the tripod. 
 Okay. Shut up. (slaps) 
 (chuckles) Start talking. 
 (clears throat) 
 Hello, gentle youtubers. 
 I am the artist currently known as "Riley." 
 And I've been documenting my transition from female to male ever since I was 16. 
 And today I get my bottom surgery done. 
 (chuckles) Which... Yeah, so... and I'm here with my mom. 
 And, oh, my righteous psychiatrist, Dr. Murphy. 
 Ah... (chuckles) 
 I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kind of guy. 
 Here. Is this a script? 
 (chuckles) You wish. It's the consent form. 
 I signed yours. Now you have to sign mine. 
 Or else, forever be covered in a blue dot. 
 Well, hello. 
 Hey. 
 So I hear you landed on the name "Riley." 
 I like it. It suits you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay, but does it... I mean, does it say... boy? 
 (whispers) Yes. 
 Yeah? 
 Okay, good. Because I... 
 I want to go stealth from now on, so... 
 (chuckles) 
 Okay, I know that this is a very exciting day for you. 
 Yeah, well, that's an understatement. 
 Okay. But we need to go over some important pre-op stuff first. 
 I'll see you after the surgery. 
 I'll be sure to come up with appropriately pithy sound bites. 
 (chuckles) Hey, no uterus jokes.  Period. 
 Huh? (chuckles) 
 Okay. So your hysterectomy/oophorectomy isn't as visible as your mastectomy. 
 But it is a radical procedure. 
 Okay. Well, radical is the way I roll. 
 Along with the obvious negation of fertility, the sudden change in hormone levels can carry severe side effects. 
 Wow. (chuckles) 
 I mean, you're killing my buzz here, doc. 
 Well... that's the way I roll. 
 Slowed metabolism, loss of bone density... you need to prepare for that. 
 (whispers) Okay. 
 (normal voice) I mean, I-I-I get it. 
 But, uh... (inhales deeply) in a few hours, I'm going to feel more like myself than I've ever felt. 
 And  nothing  can kill that buzz. (chuckles) 
 (chuckles) See, you're such a guy. (chuckles) 
 See you later. 
 Okay. 
 (inhales deeply, groans) 
 Jana Raymond... she was, uh, jumping on a trampoline when she fractured her left proximal tib/fib. 
 Ugh, not gonna let my kids anywhere near one of those death traps. 
 (chuckles) Well, she's actually 39. 
 A mature trampolinist. Awesome. 
 (curtain rings clack) 
 (woman) You seem to be doing really well. 
 Hello, Jana. I am Dr. Harris. 
 Um... wow! 
 So a trampoline injury. Were you, um... 
 Are you a gymnast? 
 (chuckles) Uh, no. 
 I like food too much for that. 
 You, uh, jumping with your kids? 
 No. Single, childless, and not a gymnast. 
 Should be my online dating profile, right? 
 (chuckles) 
 (chuckles) 
 Can you, um, feel that? 
 (voice breaks) Mm-hmm. 
 Does that hurt? 
 (strained voice) Like a son of a bitch. 
 Okay. 
 So what were you doing on the trampoline then? 
 Scaled my neighbor's fence this morning after he left for work. 
 That's funny. Most people just steal their neighbor's wi-fi. 
 I'm not most people. 
 Yeah, I'm getting that. 
 I'm gonna need to do a closed reduction. 
 So we better sedate you first. 
 Oh, no. I don't... no drugs. 
 I don't want any drugs, please. 
 Is that a religious thing? 
 No. No religion. No. 
 I have a lot of stuff I have to do in the next few hours. 
 So I don't really want to be stoned for any of it. 
 Well, you're gonna need something to manage the pain. 
 Okay, just give me as little as... (exhales) possible to get through it. 
 Okay. Let's do, um, 50 micrograms of fentanyl, Rambo. 
 Okay. 50 it is. That's... it. 
 There you go. 
 Uh, you're gonna need me for countertraction. 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 This stuff works really fast. 
 Well, this is still gonna hurt. 
 On three? 
 And... (strained voice) three! (cracks) 
 Aah! (laughs) 
 All right. 
 You let me know if she needs any more brown sugar. 
 Thank you, hip-hop. 
 I'm going to take you up for a post-reduction x-ray. 
 Really? Can't you just give me some crutches and let me go? I've got a lot of stuff to do. 
 I think that can probably wait. 
 No. It can't. Really. I-I've got until midnight. 
 Why, what happens at midnight? 
 You, uh, turn into a pumpkin like Cinderella? 
 It was her  carriage that turned into a pumpkin. 
 And you're avoiding the question. 
 You'll think I'm nuts. 
 Miss Raymond, what happens at midnight? 
 (sighs) I'm gonna die. 
 By midnight tonight I'll be dead. 
 ♪ 
 And during the surgery, don't go further than there. 
 And keep to my left. 
 'Cause that's my good side. (singsongy) Thank you. 
 (woman sighs) I'm shaking. 
 Coffee addict. 
 No, I'm just so excited for you. (chuckles) 
 Everything goes smoothly, he'll be home tom-tomorrow. 
 (knock on door, monitor beeps) 
 Alex : Excuse us for a second. 
 What do you have? 
 Riley's pre-op C.T. (sighs) 
 Mmm. 
 There's a mass density here in the retroperitoneal area. 
 Look like a sarcoma to you? 
 It's hard to tell. 
 Anything retroperitoneal I usually refer immediately. 
 Could it be Castleman's disease? 
 No. He has no history of H.I.V. or herpes. 
 What about Desmoid tumors? 
 Aren't Desmoids super rare? 
 Yeah. But if it is Desmoid tumors and we cut... 
 They'll multiply. 
 We can't risk it. 
 I don't know how I'm going to tell him. 
 Hey. 
 And there's the beautiful surgeon Ready to take out the baby-maker. 
 What's going on? 
 Why did you take that off? 
 (sighs) 
 Turn off the camera. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Is it cancer? 
 We don't know that yet. 
 Oh, my god. 
 I... (chuckles) I don't care. 
 Riley. 
 I know how disappointing this must be. 
 No, no, no, no. I'm serious. 
 If-if I have cancer, I want to have it as a man. 
 Riley, removing your uterus and ovaries is an elective surgery. 
 No. 
 For me it's not. 
 I thought you said we were gonna see this whole thing through together. 
 We will. 
 We just need to put the brakes on until I can biopsy the mass. 
 I don't believe this. 
 When will we know what it is? 
 Soon, hopefully. 
 In the meantime, you'll have to go off your meds. 
 No, no, no, no. Going off the "T," that's... that's not an option. No, no. 
 Riley. 
 Testosterone puts you at a higher risk for certain types of cancer. 
 So until we know exa... 
 Of course. 
 We'll stop. 
 Reycraft : Okay. Um... 
 Dr. Reid will bring you back up to the ward. 
 Screw that. I'm not leaving. 
 Riley, listen to me. 
 We will figure this out, okay? 
 I give you my word. 
 (whispers) We're in this together, right? 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Jana, this is Dr. Murphy. 
 Are you from physio? 
 No, actually, Jana, I'm a psychiatrist. 
 Hoping to talk to you about what you told Dr. Harris earlier. 
 I knew I should have kept my mouth shut. 
 It was the drugs that made me loose-lipped. 
 Jana, this is kind of important. 
 I need to know why you feel like you want to hurt yourself. 
 No. I don't  want  to die. 
 I'm just fairly certain that I'm going to... tonight. 
 Someone threaten you? 
 No. 
 Something you heard in the news? 
 (sighs) 
 Tomorrow is my birthday. 
 The big 4-0. 
 And it just so happens that no woman in my family has ever lived that long. 
 A genetic condition? 
 No. Mom died of ovarian cancer. 
 She was 39. Her last words to me were... 
 (whispers)  "vámonos." 
 (normal voice) It means "let's go." 
 That must have been hard. 
 Mm, it was weird. And then a few years ago, my only aunt died in a car crash just after her 39th birthday. 
 (inhales sharply) And last March, my sister drowned on a camping trip. 
 Do you want to guess how old she was? 
 Jana, um... 
 Three people dying doesn't mean that it's a pattern. 
 Actually, doctor, I'm fairly certain that that's the definition of a pattern. 
 I am surrounded by death. 
 Call me crazy. (chuckles) 
 She's not delusional. She has an overvalued idea. 
 If she was delusional, she would know more specifics Like, "I'm going to get hit with a bus" 
 "at the corner of first and main." 
 Okay. So you're saying she's not crazy then? 
 Not a term I love to use, but no. 
 If I had to guess, I'd say this has something to do with her mother's death. 
 So what do we do? Tell her it's all in her mind? 
 No, actually... the opposite. 
 I think she needs to feel that she's being heard. 
 Okay. I'll order a full-body C.T. scan. 
 (chuckles) Didn't think you'd jump on board so fast. 
 Well, premonitions of death may seem flakey, Gavin, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. 
 You just fixed her leg. 
 How are you going to justify a C.T.? 
 Well, she was alone when she fell off that trampoline, right? 
 Who's to say she also didn't hit her head? 
 So his name is Huell. 
 Huell. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 What kind of a name is that? 
 Uh, it's welsh, I think. 
 Look, i-it doesn't matter anyways, he's... he's been my client for six months. 
 And he's just been doing really, really good. 
 Yeah, of course he has. 
 He has a splendid social worker. (chuckles) 
 Well, not today. 
 I kind of have a really big problem. 
 What the  Huell  happened? 
 (chuckles) Joel. 
 I need your help. He-he... he spent 60 days at Braxton. 
 And we got him right into sober living. 
 And he's just, you know, I mean, he's... he's been doing aces. 
 I don't like where this is going. 
 Well, his brother died out west. And he didn't have the money to go to the funeral... 
 Here we go. 
 So he, um... um, he had a drink, which led to an 8 ball of coke, which he shot up with a dirty needle. 
 And he ended up with a soft tissue infection in his left arm. 
 A lymphangitic spread? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, his arm is it's a... it's a mess. 
 But I got him admitted last night. 
 And I have a bed waiting for him at Selby House. 
 Okay. It sounds like you have everything under control here. 
 So what is the problem? 
 (voice cracks) Well... 
 Okay. 
 Sonja? 
 Yeah. 
 Where is your client? 
 Um, just... (knocks on wall) 
 Huell? 
 Huell, it's-it's... it's okay. We're here. 
 Huell : Wait, who's we? 
 Um, just... just my friend Joel and I. 
 (mouths words) He's... um, he's... a doctor. 
 Can he give me some narcotics? (sighs) 
 (chuckles) 
 He's inside the wall? 
 Okay. So Joel, he just... he went through the panel in the ceiling to try to find a drug cabinet... to rob. 
 And then, um... (chuckles) uh, he got stuck. 
 (sighs) 
 This is the problem you needed my help with? 
 Yeah. (chuckles) It's... 
 Joel. Joel, please. 
 Huell, just... 
 Hang tight, okay? Joel! 
 I don't really have a choice. Sonja... 
 Joel, please just... 
 There is a junkie in my wall. 
 You know, I can't endanger this hospital just to accommodate your... granted very unfortunate... but still criminal client. 
 Look, he is on parole. If you call the cops... 
 The cops can't throw him in jail for being stupid, right? 
 No. They will put him back in jail, Joel. They will. 
 That's not really my concern now is it, Sonja? 
 I'm so sorry, but... Could you get the fire department on the phone, please? 
 Look... 
 I might be implicated in this as well. 
 Hold up one second. 
 What do you mean you could be implicated in this? 
 Just... (chuckles) 
 (chuckles) 
 Okay, look. So he called me last night from a bar, and he was out of his mind with grief and... and other things, and he's... in clear violation of his parole. 
 Now, I... 
 Okay, you were obliged to report him. 
 Which I didn't. 
 And I could lose my license. 
 (lowered voice) What do you want me to do? 
 (lowered voice) Joel, just please... please help me get him out without anybody else finding out. Please. 
 I... but, Sonja, I can't just start cutting into hospital walls. 
 I don't know his position in there for one thing. 
 I could do him some serious harm here. 
 I know. But, Joel, I have to... 
 I have to think about Ryan. I can't... 
 (whispers) I can't lose my job. Please. 
 Please, I'm sorry. 
 Slight change of plan here. 
 Could you have a... portable X-ray and a cast saw sent to ward 4, please? 
 Joel, did you get a chance to review the case I sent you? 
 Alex. 
 I have not had an opportunity. I'm sorry, I've been sno... 
 L-l... Alex. That's Al... crazy road trip Alex? 
 Wow! I was... 
 I-I was just picturing Alex Trebek. 
 Sorry to disappoint you. (chuckles) 
 Sonja chuckles : So, Alex, this is, uh, Sonja. 
 Oh, hi! Nice to meet you. 
 So what's up? 
 Riley's C.T. 
 Yeah. 
 I reviewed it with the head of radiology. 
 We both think that there is a separation between the uterus and the mass. 
 Plan "B." 
 She always has a plan "B." 
 I do the surgery laparoscopically. 
 Okay. What does Reycraft say about thiss? 
 He's not confident we can do it. 
 And you are looking for someone to say that you can. 
 It's a little bit of a minefield, I gotta say, Alex. 
 I know. (sighs) 
 But looking at the C.T. 
 If I could just get the scope in there, I think that I... 
 (sighs) Okay. 
 This thing turns out to be malignant. 
 One little scratch on that mass, he could be dead in six months. 
 I know. 
 It gets really distorted in there sometimes. I mean... if you promise me that you will bail at the first sign of trouble. 
 I'll be careful not to step on any mines. 
 (clicks tongue) No cameras. 
 Thank you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let's go cut down a wall. 
 (sighs and whispers) Oh, god. Thank you, Joel. 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
 9: 00 is the earliest? 
 Yeah, okay. No, great. I'll take it. 
 Thanks. 
 I booked you a C.T. 
 I just booked a table at Momofuku. 
 Wanna join me? 
 No. I have to work. (sighs) 
 Well, here's hoping I croak before the bill comes then. 
 You're not dying tonight, Jana. 
 Not on your watch. 
 Look, just get me some crutches and get me out of here. 
 I have ordered you a full-body C.T. scan. 
 (sighs) There isn't time. 
 Jana... 
 Look, do you... do you have any idea what it's like to be at death's door and stuck in a... hospital? 
 Um, actually, I do. 
 You have to listen to this feeling... that something isn't right. 
 Hey... I'm saying I believe you. 
 You said that with a straight face. 
 Well, I'm your doctor. 
 It's my job to get to the bottom of... whatever this is. 
 I am taking you seriously. 
 So take me seriously. 
 Alex : It feels like we're in tiger country. 
 We'll need to divide these adhesions to see if we're good. 
 Avoid touching that mass. 
 You know the stakes. 
 Thanks for that. 
 No pressure. 
 His pressure is fine. 
 I'm talking to Reid. 
 Get me closer, Reycraft. 
 I need to see this. 
 There? (monitor beeps) 
 Alex : Uh, damn. Is that urine in the field? 
 Did you nick the bladder? 
 The bladder shouldn't be that high up. 
 Let's check it with methylene blue. 
 (monitor beeping) 
 (beeps) 
 Blue is leaking into the cavity. 
 There's your nick. 
 (sighs) 
 (clacks) Needle driver and some 3-0 monocryl. 
 (objects clatter, monitor beeps) 
 (Alex speaks indistinctly) 
 Okay. (monitor beeps) 
 (beeps) 
 Is that a purse string suture? 
 Yep. I'm everting the edges to give better wound approximation. 
 Keep it simple, Reid. 
 Two stitches should do it. 
 As long as it doesn't leak. 
 Alex : Okay, what's the next move? 
 Tom : We're done. 
 No. No, no. I'm fixing it. Let's keep rolling. 
 You want to end up in another M&M together? 
 It's a minor complication. 
 Just because you're a little gun-shy... 
 Lucky it's the bladder and not the mass. 
 Otherwise, he'd be facing a death sentence. 
 What's happening? 
 Can someone deal with her, please? 
 I can do this. 
 No. 
 I can't believe I let you talk me into this in the first place. 
 Reycraft... 
 It's too risky. 
 Finish your suturing. We're done. 
 (beeps) 
 (machine beeping steadily) 
 What happened? 
 There was a complication. 
 Things became too risky, And we couldn't complete your hysterectomy. 
 This... this is a joke, right? 
 Mom, tell me... tell me you're punk'ng me. 
 I'm so sorry, baby. 
 Your small bowel is stuck to your bladder and uterus. 
 Things aren't in the right place. 
 Yeah, no kidding. 
 Okay, listen... I know that you really wanted this surgery. 
 But it's not safe for you. 
 (inhales, exhales) 
 You know what, doctor? If you're not gonna do this for me, I'm gonna find someone on the internet who will. 
 You need to lay back, okay? 
 No. No. No. Screw you! 
 Okay, Riley, I understand that you're angry with me... 
 You're friggin' right! (clatters) 
 Look, I trusted you! You stay the hell away from me! 
 Holly, I've never seen him like this. 
 Well, my uterus has made me act pretty crazy at times, too. 
 You? 
 80 milligrams of testosterone weekly shouldn't affect his behavior like this. 
 We did just find out that he might have cancer. 
 Have you been monitoring his hormones? 
 He hates needles. He gets me to inject them. 
 And you're sure he's not getting them from another source? 
 Maybe double-dipping, maybe? What? 
 What are you saying? 
 Could he be hiding it from you? 
 We don't have any secrets. 
 I'm not making accusations. 
 You kind of are. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Huell, how you doing? 
 Huell : I don't feel so good. 
 (beeping) 
 I know. Just-just hang in there, okay? 
 Joel's just setting up the X-ray machine. 
 I just need to get a picture to see how you're positioned in there, buddy. 
 Huell : Yeah. 
 Wouldn't wanna end up cutting you in half. 
 That-that'd be good. 
 Sorry I messed up, Sonja. 
 Look, relapse, it's just... it's... it's a normal part of recovery. 
 Huell : Sure is the fun part. 
 We're gonna get you out of there. 
 (blows air) Give me your earrings. 
 Sorry? 
 Your earrings. 
 Uh, give 'em to me. You'll get 'em back. 
 So listen, I mean, you and, uh... Trebek, you-you... you used to date? 
 We did. Yeah. 
 Did you cohabitate? 
 Momentarily. 
 And, um... she's, uh, she's single now? 
 No. 
 And we're just friends. Come on. 
 (jacket thuds) 
 Hit the lights. 
 Okay. 
 (light switch clicks, machine clicks) 
 (clicks) 
 (buzzes) 
 (beeps) 
 Oh... 
 Joel : Wow. 
 Wow, he's... really stuck in there. 
 Yeah. 
 Huell : Yeah, guys, my arm's really hurting now. 
 What are you doing? Guys? 
 Uh... 
 Okay, it's like, there are my earrings. 
 Yeah. Um... 
 Okay. Um, let's use that as a landmark. 
 And then we'll, um, we'll cut 2 inches above that one there. 
 Huell, can you move your arm? 
 No. Uh, n-no, I can't. 
 It's-it's pinned under me. It's starting to kill. 
 What? 
 Joel? 
 What-what's wrong? 
 If he loses circulation with a lymphangitic infection, he could go septic really, really fast. 
 We've gotta get him out of there. 
 Uh... 
 We're gonna need a bigger boat. 
 Well, if it isn't crocodile dundee. 
 He's australian, not a kiwi. 
 Give us a hug. 
 Come here. Come here. 
 Aah. 
 Good, man. You been demoted, or what? 
 You wanna restock my tongue depressors? 
 Yeah, it looks like it, doesn't it? 
 Hey, man, I hear congrats are in order. 
 You're, uh, you're speaking at a Sunrise Meeting tomorrow, Or something? 
 Yeah. A Sunrise Meeting. 
 Mm-hmm. In the old days, the only time I'd see a sunrise is from the back of a cruiser. 
 (cell phone vibrates) Ooh. 
 Yeah. I have... a photographer all set up in my office. 
 Cool. A photo shoot. 
 You know the key to doing a good photo, right? 
 Yeah, Alex has already briefed me on that. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 Does this look like it'll cut through a wall? 
 Aah. 
 Hey. 
 I haven't discharged you. What are you doing? 
 He found a doctor in Aruba who's willing to do his surgery. 
 I've tried to talk sense into him. 
 He just... he won't hear it. 
 So, Riley, this is what you want? 
 You want some internet hack to operate on you? 
 This is dangerous. 
 No. No. 
 No, I... 
 I wanted you to do it, but it... I mean, it doesn't look like that's gonna happen. 
 So I have to do what I have to do. 
 You just had surgery. You need to stay here in the hospital. 
 And you, you need to talk to him, and you need to... 
 Hey, no, no. Don't you dare! Don't you... 
 Oh. Riley... 
 This was not her decision. It was mine, okay? 
 She's my... She's my... 
 I understand that, but you need to try and relax. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 You don't question her, okay? 
 Riley, can you try to stay calm, please? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Riley! 
 Ms. Stiles, your daughter has suffered a heart arrhythmia. 
 He's my son. 
 I'm just going by the chart. 
 Uh, Riley, have you been taking anything other than your testosterone? 
 E.C.G. shows left ventricular hypertrophy. 
 A sign of steroid abuse. 
 Hold on. 
 Which also explains your behavior. 
 I don't have roid rage. 
 I mean, you weren't gonna do my surgery. 
 I might have cancer. I was upset. 
 You went through my stuff? 
 Hey, that's an invasion of privacy. 
 There are enough steroids in here to supply the Tour de France. 
 I mean, so... steroids are barely even illegal anymore. 
 Oh, no. They're very illegal. 
 I was trying to bulk up. 
 I mean, it's hard to gain muscle mass when you're a vegan. 
 Where did you get them from? 
 Off some guy at my gym. 
 Your C.T. scan results, Jana. 
 You're all clear. 
 So I'm not gonna die? 
 Mm, no, you're gonna die. In about, um... oh, 55 years. 
 (laughs) 
 I guess this is good-bye, then. 
 No. You're wrong again. 
 I gotta do a follow-up on that leg in about six weeks. 
 Sure. (elevator bell dings) 
 Vámonos,  Dr. Harris. 
 (telephone ringing in distance) 
 Good-bye, Jana. 
 (button clicks) 
 (radio chatter) 
 (clatters) 
 Charlie : Jana! 
 Jana. 
 Come inside. 
 Why? 
 (breathing heavily) 
 'Cause you don't want to do this. 
 I didn't come up here to jump. 
 It's the perseid meteor shower. 
 Happens every year in August, and it was on my bucket list. 
 Man : ♪ you've got light in the darkness ♪ 
 Oh. 
 Wow. 
 Look at that. 
 Did you see that? 
 Yeah. Ol' perseid puts on quite a show. 
 Nothing like a wonder to make you wonder. 
 About what?

 I'm asking you now. 
 You're not dying tonight, Jana. 
 (scoffs) 
 Just answer the question. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe there's something more. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 You knew about the steroids. 
 The hell are you talking about? 
 Couple of videos go viral, and now you're a stage mom? 
 You think I care about that? 
 I don't know what I think. 
 All I know is that when I asked him where I got the drugs from, he looked at you. 
 I know this must seem crazy to you. 
 It does. 
 I was just trying to be supportive. 
 I didn't want to mess up... again. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Riley was born... with both parts. 
 He had both female and male reproductive organs? 
 Well, there was nothing in his medical files about a variation of s*x development. 
 The doctor recommended that we wait to see which gender he grew up to identify with. 
 But I couldn't. 
 I thought if I chose, his life would be... easier. 
 Better. 
 And I wanted a girl, so... 
 Does Riley have any idea? 
 He was a baby. 
 We had the surgery, and I just buried it. 
 Never told him. 
 (whirring) 
 Are we the only business that still uses a fax machine? 
 Who's Elizabeth Stiles? 
 My F.T.M. patient Riley. 
 These are his 20-year-old medical records. 
 What are we looking for? 
 Riley was born with both male and female parts. 
 His mother's kept it a secret from him all these years. 
 That's heavy. 
 When he started to identify as male, she must have felt pretty guilty for making the wrong call. 
 At 3 months old, he has a feminizing genitoplasty and is raised as a girl. 
 He also had a pelvic surgery to remove abnormal ovarian tissue during feminization. 
 We need to confirm with immunohistochemistry, But that fibroblastic tissue is not a tumor at all. 
 It's 20-year-old scar tissue. 
 Are you gonna tell him? 
 Someone has to. 
 (tape ripples) 
 Lights. 
 Yeah. Great. 
 (click) 
 (click) 
 Cute. 
 Let's get this party started. 
 (saw whirs) 
 Okay, Huell! 
 Huell : Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee... 
 (saw whirring) 
 What time is it? 
 Um... actually, no. No. 
 Don't tell me. I don't... I don't wanna know. 
 My hand is sweaty. 
 Well... so's mine. 
 (cell phone button clicks) 
 Happy birthday. 
 12: 01. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Really? 
 Yep. 
 Feel good to be wrong? 
 Yeah. So good. 
 Oh. Oh. 
 What? 
 Oh, no. 
 What? 
 The last 24 hours just came flooding back to me. 
 I... I made an epic scene at work. 
 I maxed out all my credit cards. 
 I think I actually might be a fugitive. 
 Thank you. 
 For what? I didn't do anything but fix your bum leg. 
 Yeah. 
 You did. 
 Take care of yourself, Jana. 
 (whirring) 
 (whirring stops) 
 (exhales) 
 Let's move this stuff. 
 Right. Uh... 
 Here, and help me grab this mattress. 
 You got it. 
 All right. 
 All right, Huell. Almost there. 
 Huell : Good, 'cause I am starting to freak out in here. 
 Sonja, are you still there? 
 Yeah? It's okay? 
 I think so. 
 Um... 
 Okay. Give it a push, mate! 
 Just... but... be careful! 
 Yeah. 
 Uhh! 
 I-I get morphine for this, right? 
 Oh, god. 
 Huell. You okay? 
 I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 Oh, god. 
 (knocks) 
 Riley? 
 I have some news for you. 
 I've booked an O.R., and we're gonna go ahead with your hysterectomy... unless you'd rather go to Aruba. 
 (laughs) 
 You better not be messing with me, doc. 
 I'm not. We'll do the open procedure as originally planned. 
 Oh. I don't understand. What-what changed? 
 The mass we discovered in your pelvis... turns out it was scar tissue from a previous surgery. 
 But I... I've only ever had two surgeries... my-my wisdom teeth and my mastectomy. 
 He should hear it from you. 
 I can't. 
 Please. 
 Riley, the scar tissue was from a gender assignment surgery you had as a baby. 
 You had both female and male genitalia. 
 You were assigned female at birth. 
 What? 
 No. 
 No. No. You... you decided for me? 
 I was trying to protect you. 
 How... how could you? 
 I love you. 
 You lied to me. 
 What was I supposed to tell you? 
 (voice breaking) The truth. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Jana. 
 What are you still doing here? 
 Thought I kicked you out. 
 Well, I guess you're a hard guy to leave. 
 Well, I told you this isn't good-bye. 
 Need to see that... 
 Where's your cast? 
 Oh. I... I don't know. I was just... 
 (breathing heavily) 
 Okay. 
 Zach : Again. 
 Zach : Come on. 
 Huh. 
 (Zach breathing heavily) 
 "Natural causes." 
 What's natural about a healthy 39-year-old dropping dead? 
 You never know when it's gonna be your time. 
 Oh, I did. 
 Did she, uh, mention being under any physical or emotional stress? 
 She had premonitions of her own death. 
 Uh, she was working off a bucket list. 
 Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome affects the electrical functioning of the heart, but there are no structural abnormalities. 
 So it wouldn't have showed up on any scan? 
 No. 
 Looks like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me. 
 Damn it. 
 Don't, uh, have the body removed. 
 Charlie... 
 I'm-I'm her doctor. 
 I'll look after it, okay? 
 (machine beeping steadily) 
 Hi. 
 Your surgery was a success. 
 Thank you. 
 Welcome to the world, Mr. Riley Stiles. 
 (laughs) 
 I'm going off shift. 
 Is there anything you need for comfort? 
 Ginger ale? "GQ"? 
 Is she still here? 
 She's been pacing outside the whole time. 
 (whispers) Can you get her for me? 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 How you feeling? 
 Uh, crampy. 
 Last time. 
 (chuckles) 
 (chuckles) 
 I love you. You know that, right? 
 Well, duh. 
 (laughs) 
 (laughs) 
 It's just... I... I think it's just gonna take some time. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I mean, it's an exciting day. 
 And I want my mom here for it. 
 Oh. 
 This... this came for you. 
 It's my student card. 
 You look handsome... 
 Son. 
 (inhales, exhales) 
 I'm sorry, Jana. 
 For what? 
 For not saving your life. 
 You did the best you could. 
 I mean, you listened to me. 
 You believed in me. You're gonna be going away soon. Will you stay with me? I mean, just till I do? Girl shouldn't be alone on her birthday. Yeah, I'm still your doctor. I'm not going anywhere. Interesting feeling, this. Kind of like bouncing on a trampoline. Just suspended. I think I'm losing my mind. My mother learned to speak spanish from these old records that she bought at a flea market. She was fun, too. Anyway, the one that she used to sing to me,  was about this woman who runs off with an outlaw  to a place where they... where they won't be judged  for who they are. So is this who I am? Who else is there to be? Vámonos. (horns honking in distance) No sepsis. Hey. Soft tissue infection's clearing up nicely. Just a slight contusion from... (sighs) From-from when he fell out of a wall? Yes, but he should be good to move to Selby House in just a day or two, so yeah. Oh, Joel... thank you. It was just a wall. So, um, how was... how was the big glamour shoot? According to Alex, the key to a winning photo is to be thinking of a secret. So all I had to do was think of today's escapades, and it was... I had a secret. Anyway, I think we should celebrate. I'm starving. Uh, I'm thinking, like, late night/early morning waffles. (siren wailing in distance) I don't... you know what? I don't think that I should. Okay. What's going... This is not an "I don't feel like waffles" look. This is... Joel... (sighs) I've had so much fun with you. Right? And you are... I mean, you are an unbelievable guy. And I mean, you're... you're amazing with Ryan, and... But what? (stammers) I just... I guess I've been waiting for, you know, something to shift, you know? For... (sighs) for you to look at me different. And-and today, I realized why that can't happen. Why? Because it's... it's how you look at Trebek. Alex and I have a lot of history. And it doesn't... it doesn't matter how much I like you, Joel. I just... I don't... (sighs) I don't think that I'm up for that. I'm sorry. (whispers) Bye.

Today is the day I air it all out. My story. (lowered voice) What are you doing here? So here that goes. When I was 12, just starting to understand what it meant to be a man, my pop died. And my mother, god bless her soul, she went off the rails. She's a drunk... like her son. Then I became a medic, and things really got interesting. I took an... ambulance for a joyride... across the border. And I hit bottom a few months ago. My sister... she was there. She was there to pick me up, you know? Like always. She dragged me, kicking and screaming, to treatment with you lovely people. She's it. She's, uh... She's the reason I'm here. She's the only reason. (indistinct conversations) Thank you. I am so proud of him. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, well, uh... ooh. I would sort of reserve your gratitude. It's, um, it's worse than hospital coffee. Good stuff. See? So where's Charlie? I don't know. He said he was gonna be here, but... Well, that was uncomfortable, wasn't it? You were great. Thank you. I appreciate it. What are you doing here? Did you hear that? I did hear that, man. Oh, man. You were stellar. You're being sweet. You're being sweet. Well, I don't know. I think we should celebrate. Let's go somewhere with decent coffee, and... I want waffles. I like waffles. Waffles? I could eat. Okay. Where's Charlie? I don't know. Stuck in traffic, ya think? ( "vámonos"  playing) ♪  vámonos  ♪ ♪ donde nadie nos juzgue ♪
