 This can't be happening. This can't be happening. 
 This can't be happening. 
 This can't be happening. 
 I'm not gonna let this happen, not yet. 
 I know that feeling. 
 Mack? 
 That's right. 
 You're dead. 
 No, I mean, really,  really  dead. 
 I went to your service months ago. 
 And I appreciated you being there. 
 Meant a lot. 
 You're one of the finest surgeons I ever trained. 
 Whatcha doing here, Mack? 
 Oh, right. That new group of med students. 
 There's this one... 26, great rack, little horn-rimmed glasses. 
 She's up to her elbows in my bowels right now. 
 You're down there, too? 
 Uh, no. No, I'm upstairs. 
 Huh? I'm in a coma. 
 (inhales sharply) Oh. 
 Dawn pulled the plug this morning. 
 Took you off the ventilator? 
 I wouldn't have thought her the type. 
 Yep. She's full of surprises. 
 You're on your way out then? You agonal? 
 Not yet. 
 So, what, you've got an hour, two? 
 Don't worry. 
 I've done this before down in the morgue, and I have an impeccable bedside manner. 
 Done what? 
 Help people to cross over. 
 Charlie... 
 I'm here to help you die. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Mel? 
 Mel, Charlie's breathing still isn't agonal. 
 It seems fine. 
 He may breathe for some time. You know this, Alex. 
 Right. I was just... 
 Maybe I wasn't expecting it to keep sounding... okay. 
 (sighs) 
 It's good to see his face. 
 I've missed it. 
 Look at you. 
 You have a change of clothes? 
 What? 
 No. 
 I've got some stuff in my locker. 
 Thanks. (sighs) 
 You know, if he's still breathing, there's time to do something. 
 I could appeal. 
 Yeah, you could appeal to Dawn. 
 You know what I mean. A legal appeal. 
 I know families of my patients who have tried. 
 The odds are impossible, Alex. 
 Have any of the families ever won? 
 In all these years, just once. 
 Who's their lawyer? 
 Stupid, stupid, stupid. 
 I know. (sighs) 
 A bar fight? A broken hand? 
 On the upside, they're insured. 
 That's not the point. We pay you for those hands. 
 Dana, there's nothing you can say to me I haven't already said to myself. 
 Fifth metacarpal fracture? 
 That's right. 
 So what are we looking at? A couple weeks? 
 Just until the splint comes off. 
 After that, I will be back to work. 
 Yeah, you better be. 
 So I guess I see you in a couple of weeks. 
 No, I can still work. 
 You can't do surgery. 
 I can diagnose. I can still consult. 
 Joel, you just lost a patient. 
 It comes with the territory. 
 Suicide? 
 Dana, I am fine. 
 (sighs) 
 I've seen worse. 
 Alex : You have? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How long will an appeal take? 
 To write? Oh, couple hours. 
 I'll just set up shop right here in the hospital. 
 I gave up my office. 
 But hey, it's the age of the internet, right? 
 Nothing you can't do on the go. 
 Okay, so we'll know today? 
 We will know where we stand. 
 (clears throat) Alex... 
 These appeals are rarely granted. 
 Ah-ah-ah. "Rarely" ain't the same as "never," my friend. 
 All it takes is one legal mistake in your proceedings, and we are golden. 
 What do I have to do? 
 I charge $500 an hour. 
 I like to get that part out of the way. 
 Then you leave it to me, I roll up my sleeves, and I file an appeal with the court this afternoon. 
 (pager buzzes) 
 (buzz) 
 Sorry. I have a page. 
 Oh, before you head off, I need you to get me transcripts from your hearing, your lawyer's notes, and Charlie's full medical file. 
 (clears throat) I'll... I'll get that for you. 
 It's fine. It's fine. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 This is one of Charlie's patients? 
 She was Dr. Macilreath's patient. 
 After he died, Charlie did her last follow-up. 
 Oh. (sighs) This is Bea. 
 You know her? 
 Yeah. I-I did her surgery. 
 I can call someone else. 
 This is a special case. 
 I wanna take it. And thank you for letting me know. 
 (curtain rings rattle) 
 Bea? 
 I'm Dr. Reid. 
 (curtain rings rattle) 
 You came in with flu-like symptoms? 
 If you could just... (gasping) 
 Okay, you know what? Uh, don't bother answering. 
 Nurse? Nurse! 
 (continues gasping) My name is Victor. 
 She came in here with flu-like symptoms. Now she's got stridor. 
 What's her respiratory rate? 
 40. And her 02 sats are dropping fast. 
 (gagging) 
 You need to intubate. 
 Right. Ketamine. 
 I'm on it. 
 Bea, you are gonna be just fine. 
 What I want you to do is try to breathe with me if you can, okay? 
 Just try to relax. 
 And one... 
 Push ketamine, 12 milligrams. 
 Pushing ketamine. 
 Bea, try to focus on me if you can, okay? 
 Ketamine in. 
 Good girl. Good job. 
 Okay, let's lay her back. 
 All right, here we go. 
 Can I get some help in here, please?! 
 (grunts) She's out. 
 I need a flexible bronchoscope and an O.P.A. 
 Okay. 
 Great. 
 Get it in there? 
 Yep. 
 Okay. 
 (click) 
 Difficult airway. 
 Do a self-maneuver for me. 
 All right. 
 You need to get it in. 
 The airway's obstructed. 
 She's going into laryngeal spasm. 
 Have you done this before? 
 My first day of residency. 
 Dr. Harris! 
 Charlie : Yeah? 
 It's all right. You've got it. 
 You've got it. 
 (Bea groaning) Just relax your wrist. 
 Relax. 
 Okay. 
 Now watch the monitor. 
 More importantly, feel your way down the trachea. 
 You got it. 
 I'm in. 
 Sats are coming back up. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 You just need practice. 
 You must be our new resident. I'm Dr. Harris. 
 I googled you before I... 
 Put an N.G. tube in, decompress her stomach, and get a portable chest. 
 This is not the flu. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 He's always like that? 
 Yep, pretty much. 
 Bea. 
 Dr. Reid? Hi. (door closes) 
 So good to see you. 
 You, too. 
 I thought I was meeting with Dr. Harris. 
 No. He had an accident. 
 He's actually... in the hospital himself. 
 Is he okay? 
 He's just not meeting with patients. 
 So it's my lucky day. I get to see you. 
 How's school going? 
 (grunts) I'm taking a year off to travel... with my boyfriend. 
 Wow. 
 We're going to Antarctica and then south Asia. 
 We're gonna be on a boat for half a year. 
 Well, I'm glad you're here. 
 It's good to get one last appointment before you leave. 
 Yeah, that's what my family doctor said. 
 Okay, well, I will give you a physical, but I'm gonna send you for a chest C.T. 
 And some blood work first. 
 Mm, of course. I know the drill. 
 Then you can have a cup of coffee or something while you wait for the test results to come back. 
 Have they figured out how to brew a decent cup of coffee downstairs yet? 
 No. 
 I mean, you could try the latte. It's drinkable. 
 Barely. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 I'm still breathing. 
 Barely. 
 And look... 
 Alex is trying to save my life. 
 It might not be my time to go, Mack. 
 Come on, Charlie. 
 You're so arrogant, you think you get to choose? 
 (sighs deeply) 
 I'm not ready. 
 Nobody's ready. That's the point. 
 Charlie, you were never a renegade but I always thought you were smart. 
 I'm... 
 I'm just saying that sometimes it takes people a while to... pass on, you know. 
 You've done this for other people, right? 
 There's something you need to figure out... 
 Before I die. 
 Now we're getting somewhere. 
 (sighs deeply) 
 What is this? 
 Fuel. 
 You're studying for your boards. I think you need fuel. 
 Gav... 
 Hmm? 
 This is not on. 
 The kiss, it was... it was a mistake. 
 Not on my side. 
 It was, though. 
 I mean, look, how long have we been friends for? 
 Five years or so. 
 And I love you, and I know you love me. 
 But we're not  in love. 
 I think there's a couple of logical fallacies in that argument. 
 I'm seeing someone else. 
 Yeah. I... 
 And I, uh, I need to study. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Did you want that croissant or... 
 No, I... you... 
 Just k... you can... you can keep it. 
 Okay. 
 Great, thanks. I'm gonna have to get you to print that one off. 
 A signature for me? 
 And file this... 
 And get this guy out of here. 
 I got paged. 
 Joel. Good, yes. 
 Nadia bird. Paraplegic, fell out of her wheelchair. 
 Colles' fracture to her right wrist. 
 Chart, please? 
 What happened to your hand? 
 Nothing. It's fine. 
 You break it? 
 Okay, this looks pretty straightforward. 
 I'll take a look at it, but you are gonna have to do the reduction. 
 Really? Why? 'cause your hand? 
 (curtain rings rattle) 
 Mrs. Bird, I'm Dr. Goran. 
 Are-are you the surgeon? Am I gonna need surgery? 
 Well, hopefully not as long as we can properly reset the bone. 
 Uh, let's do a hematoma block. 
 Uh, 20 mikes of lidocaine. 
 Let's do 25, just to be safe. 
 (under breath) Whatever. 
 Okay, so just try and relax. 
 Okay. 
 There we go. (Nadia sighs) 
 I feel ridiculous. 
 In front of the whole church, and my choir's in the middle of "Amazing Grace." 
 What do I do? I get too close to the altar steps and I tumble right down, ass over teakettle. 
 Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! 
 Oh, that's okay. 
 Let me do that, please. 
 Thank you, Dr. Miller. 
 It's okay, Nadia. It's just a local anesthetic, yeah. 
 (whispers) Okay. 
 (exhales deeply) And how about that? 
 (inhales deeply) 
 You feel any pain yet? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Okay, I'm just gonna get you to relax. 
 This part is a little bit freaky, okay? 
 But you just keep breathing. 
 Just be careful. Here we go. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 Breathing. 
 Okay. Good. How's that? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Okay, go get an X-ray and make sure it's right. 
 Should be just fine. 
 Nadia, I'm just gonna take a quick look at your legs. 
 Okay. 
 Now because of your spinal injury, obviously you're not gonna feel any pain here, but... 
 Uh-huh. 
 I just need to do a quick check and make sure that nothing else was broken when you fell. 
 Yeah, can someone let my friends know I'm okay? 
 They've been in the waiting room a while. 
 Is that the choir? 
 Yeah. 
 Yep, um, we'll let 'em know that you are just fine. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 Oh! 
 You can feel that? 
 (gasps) 
 Uh... Oh, no. I-I can't have. 
 Ow! 
 Nadia, you're feeling pain in your foot. 
 Oh, that's impossible. (gasps) 
 It's a huge mediastinal mass. 
 Given her age, it could be lymphoma. 
 Then it's treatable. 
 She survives long enough to get radiation. 
 Tumor's the size of a grapefruit. 
 She's got massive pleural effusions. 
 There's pericardial effusion, too. 
 Well, if it's lymphoma, we can't cut it out. 
 Some fluid, and both her lungs are compromised. 
 And I thought you were taking me to lunch. 
 Mm. 
 Well, there's compression on the S.V.C. 
 And most of the mediastinum. 
 It's a tough call. 
 Why don't we just drain the fluid? 
 Who are you? 
 New resident. Thank you. We have this covered. 
 Alex Reid. 
 But... that's what's putting the pressure on her lungs, right? 
 I mean, the fluid is why she can't breathe. 
 One liter of fluid isn't gonna make any difference. 
 And she's still gonna have a giant tumor blocking her superior vena cava. 
 Right, but wouldn't it help? 
 She's right. 
 We can do a trach and needle biopsy at the same time. 
 Okay, then you don't need me. 
 Page me when you're done. I'll take her over to oncology and let you know when I have a diagnosis. 
 Great. 
 (sighs) 
 So you ready for surgery? 
 What do you mean? 
 Time to step up. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 I'm not sure that I'm ready to do this. 
 Hope Zion is a teaching hospital. 
 I know that, But it's... 
 But what? 
 Do you think just a pretty face is gonna cut it here? 
 Okay. 
 Stop. 
 What are you forgetting? 
 Uh... Oh. Uh, right. 
 The patient's name is Bea Pateira. 
 We are doing a tube thoracostomy on the left-hand side, and we will leave a chest tube in. 
 That's right. Always pause like that, even if it's an emergency. 
 You say it out loud to everyone in the room. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Continue. 
 (sighing deeply) 
 (monitor beeps) Okay. 
 Use your finger to dissect the fat. 
 I'm in the pleural cavity. 
 (squish) 
 Whoa! Oh! 
 All right, it's more fluid than we thought. 
 Don't lose your nerve. 
 (squish) 
 Kelly in chest tube. 
 Remove the kelly, advance the chest tube. 
 Okay. (sighs) 
 Feeding it in. 
 And we're good. 
 Sample. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Okay. 
 Good. 
 Attach the pleurovac, please. 
 (machine beeps) 
 (suction gurgling) 
 (machine beeps) 
 How's your suturing? 
 Good. 
 Then suture. 
 O-silk, please. 
 (gurgling continues) 
 (machine beeps) 
 Okay. 
 (monitor beeps) 
 B.P. is 90 over 60, satting at 92. 
 Heart rate's 80. 
 Fluid's completely drained. 
 There was more than two liters in there. 
 Wow. (monitor beeps) 
 Pressure? 
 B.P.'s over 100. 
 Vent pressure down. 
 She's stable. 
 (gloves snap) 
 Send the sample to cytology. 
 (sighs) 
 Woman : Nice job. 
 (whispers) Yes! (laughs) 
 Is there anything in your past that's preventing you from making your peace? 
 Ah, yes... the fact that I don't want to die. 
 Charlie, listen. You weren't always so open. 
 You could be really closed off, hard. 
 Were you like that in your marriage? 
 Is there something in that? 
 You think I need to make peace with Dawn? 
 She did pull the plug on ya, after all. 
 Mack, could you not do that? 
 You used to drive me crazy when you did that. 
 Okay, snap at me. Take the focus off yourself. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 If not resolving some "thing" in my life is what's keeping me alive, why would I wanna fix that? 
 Hard case. 
 Oh, save it. 
 Bea : Hi. Are those the sizes? 
 Um, can I get a large telephone, please? 
 That's Bea. 
 Uh, there's a pay phone outside. 
 I don't want a pay phone. I want a telephone. 
 With a shot of vanilla. 
 Oh, you want a latte? 
 Yeah. (scoffs) 
 She just said "telephone." 
 Maybe she just wants to make a call. 
 Mack, she's dysphasic. 
 That could mean... 
 That she has a brain tumor. 
 (radio chatter) 
 Okay, wait. Here it is. 
 M.R.I. of Nadia's spine. 
 There's no injury. 
 I thought she was paralyzed. 
 She is. Car accident two years ago. 
 Her husband was killed, and she was diagnosed with a burst T10, paralyzed from the waist down. 
 Yeah, but her T10's fine. 
 So she's either delusional or she's faking it. 
 Really, that's what you jump to? 
 The M.R.I. doesn't lie. 
 Well, neither do church ladies. 
 Well, she's feeling pain in her legs. 
 Then it's... 
 Don't talk to me about miracles, please. 
 A surprising turn of events. 
 That's what I was gonna say, Joel. 
 Okay.

 We kind of have business to do here. 
 They're just trying to cheer me up. 
 Loosen up for five minutes, Joel. 
 ♪ 
 We have to put a cast on this woman's arm. 
 ♪ 
 All right! 
 Thank you very much for the singing, but unfortunately, it's a little too disruptive, so I'm gonna have to ask you to please move out into the waiting room. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Woman : Okay, Nadia, honey, you know we're right here. 
 Okay. I'll see ya in a bit. 
 Woman : Mm. All right, sweetheart. 
 Thank you. 
 That better? 
 Woman :  Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 How could she have a brain tumor? 
 I mean, Hodgkin's lymphoma doesn't spread to the brain. 
 No, the odds are unbelievably low. 
 (breathes deeply) 
 Unless... 
 She doesn't have Hodgkin's. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 We misdiagnosed her. 
 If we did, her follow-up won't find it now. 
 They'll never do a head C.T. for lymphoma. 
 It's no coincidence you're here, is it, Mack? 
 That's what I've been saying. 
 He loved you so much. (monitor beeping steadily) 
 (chuckles) 
 It was so obvious. 
 Every time you two were in a room together, he just lit up. 
 I think I lit up. 
 He was my best friend. That's what I think about. 
 From the moment I met him... 
 He was the only person I wanted to hang out with. 
 That's rare. 
 It is. 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 (Charlie rasping) 
 Respiratory rate's down. Mel? 
 (rasping continues) 
 Cardiac monitors. Can't trust 'em. 
 He's breathing shallow and irregular. 
 (rasping and grunting) 
 (sighs deeply) He's really struggling. 
 That's how it goes, Alex. 
 It'll be up and down for a while. 
 Alex : And then? 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 I'm just... (stammers) 
 I mean just feeding my coffee addiction. 
 Cool. 
 (sighs) Yeah. 
 So I, uh, heard about Charlie. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Don't be. It's not over. 
 Yeah, I have my lawyer filing an appeal. 
 Well, that's good. 
 Yeah. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 What happened to you? 
 Uh... nothing. 
 Just an accident. 
 Enough said. 
 Yeah. (chuckles) 
 Okay. I'll see you around. 
 So I'll see you later, yeah. 
 Mm. 
 (curtain rings rattle) 
 So how the legs feeling? 
 Um... kind of tingly. 
 Like... pins and needles, and all the way down. 
 (inhales sharply) 
 It's like I just met Jesus at the pool of Bethesda. 
 Hey, your muscles have atrophied. 
 Yeah. I know I shouldn't complain, but it's actually kind of painful. 
 Nadia, I just had your chart sent over from St. Mike's. 
 Uh, this an image taken two years ago after the accident. 
 So you had a spinal epidural hematoma in the T10 vertebrae. 
 Yeah, well, I know I had something. 
 That sounds about right. 
 So the surgeons did a... spinal decompression, which, according to this image here, went extremely well. 
 You see the cord's continuous. No swelling, plenty of room, and yet you remained paralyzed. 
 Yeah. M-my doctors, they didn't have an explanation except to say it happens that way sometimes. 
 You didn't request a second opinion? 
 I put my faith in the lord. 
 Ooh! (laughs) 
 And now look. He's healing me. 
 Mrs. Bird, I have a responsibility to get your diagnosis right here. 
 And getting your legs back after two years, it isn't... possible. 
 And yet, it is. 
 Okay. 
 Well, then I will find you something for the pain. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 In the meantime, I'll review your files and... see if I can recommend a course of treatment. 
 Okay. 
 (velcro rips) 
 Your blood pressure's fine. 
 And I wanted you to see this. 
 Your chest X-ray came back. 
 You're free and clear. 
 That's four years in a row. 
 Congratulations. 
 (chuckles) 
 So any other symptoms? Swollen lymph glands? 
 Night sweats? Itching? 
 I've had some headaches. 
 Headaches, Alex, and dysphasia. Come on, Bea, keep talk. 
 Bad headaches? 
 No, it's just stress. 
 No, it's not. 
 And with the research trip coming up, I've been getting vaccinations. 
 Right. South Asia. So you've been getting... hep "A" and "B," typhoid, rabies, and japanese encephalitis? 
 Yep, that sounds right. 
 That's a mean cocktail. 
 Any one of these would give you a headache. 
 I know it's outside the realm of lymphoma, but send her for a brain scan, Alex. 
 So... with your boyfriend Keith? You sound happy. 
 (groans) Really happy. 
 Good. 
 Um, what kind of accident did Dr. Harris have? 
 He was in a car accident. 
 Is he gonna be okay? 
 He'll be fine. 
 And that is all. 
 (sighs) 
 You're done. 
 Thank you, Dr. Reid. 
 You're welcome. 
 Charlie would be so happy for you. 
 She's gonna die if you don't think of something. 
 I know. This is over my head. 
 This isn't liposarcoma with five different kinds of approach. 
 No, it isn't. 
 Bea, don't go. Don't walk out that door. 
 She's not hearing you. 
 Stop! 
 Turn around. 
 You feel me and you hear me. 
 I'm-I'm... I'm your gut instinct. 
 I am the voice in the back of your head, and I am telling you, those words you keep misusing and those... those headaches you keep having, they mean something. 
 Don't you go. 
 Turn around. 
 Did I just do that? 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 (knocks) 
 Hi. 
 I just wanted to check in, see how he was doing. 
 Of course. I'll give you a minute. 
 No. Stay. Stay. 
 No, really. Take a minute with him. 
 What happened? 
 I'm sorry. The court... 
 They won't even hear the appeal, the bastards. 
 What? I... 
 (sighs) 
 I don't understand. 
 There were no legal errors in your proceeding, but I was hoping to sell them on unreasonable result. 
 They didn't buy it. 
 But... (sighs) 
 He's  breathing. 
 Doesn't matter to the court. 
 So... that's it? 
 Look at it this way. 
 You've tried everything. 
 Now you can just... be there for him. 
 (whispers) I'm sorry. 
 Mm. 
 (sighing) 
 It's, um... 
 It's okay to be upset. 
 Is it? Really? 
 What can I do to help? 
 You can take the D.N.R., which Charlie never believed in, off his chart. 
 No? 
 (chuckles and scoffs) 
 (thud) 
 Then go to hell! 
 (sighs) 
 (beeps) 
 (closes microwave door) 
 Hey. 
 I am assuming that you've heard about my patient. (thuds) 
 De-paralysis. Yes. Indeed I have. 
 So... traumatic event two years ago. 
 (sighs) Car accident. Husband died. 
 I'm starting to believe that she has conversion disorder. 
 Yeah. Could be. 
 Uh, it's often misdiagnosed as malingering, a patient making up symptoms for attention. 
 She's not making it up. 
 No. No, to her, it's completely real. 
 Her mind is distracting from her emotional trauma by making it physical. 
 So then why are her legs working now? Popcorn? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Uh, it could be her latest accident. 
 She relived her trauma. 
 (crunches) So what do I do? 
 You celebrate. 
 A paralyzed woman may walk again. Hallelujah! 
 Are you 100% sure you have a medical degree? (crunching) 
 Look, all I'm saying is that it's good news, so why do you have to fix it? 
 Because she has emotional problems so bad she's convinced herself she couldn't walk. 
 I think that she needs an appropriate course of treatment, so that she can get the full use of her limbs again. 
 She definitely could use some long-term therapy. 
 Right. 
 I'm happy to talk to her, but we can't force her to deal with trauma if she's not ready. 
 So what is it that you do here again? 
 (door opens) 
 (mouth full) That guy has some serious issues. 
 Hate the word "issues." 
 (crunches) 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Dr. Reid? 
 Bea. 
 I, uh... 
 I couldn't leave without saying hi to him. 
 Of course. 
 Why didn't you tell me how bad it was? 
 I'm sorry. I couldn't. 
 Well, I'm glad I came back. 
 Um, I brought him some shoes. 
 You brought him what? 
 I don't know if he can have them in here, but... 
 Have what, Bea? 
 The shoes. 
 Those aren't shoes, hon. They're flowers. 
 That's what I meant. I just, um... 
 You know, my brain's so scattered with packing, and the vaccinations... they do a number on your system, right, so I... 
 Would you like to have a minute alone with Charlie? 
 (whispers) Okay. 
 (normal voice) I'll be right out there. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 (whispers) Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Is everything okay? 
 Yes. No. 
 Um... (sighs) um, I need to find Shahir. 
 Can you just keep her here? 
 Yeah. No problem. 
 Great. (smacks counter) 
 And that... (rustles) is how you do that. 
 Tough surgery. 
 I don't know what you saw from up in the gallery, but that gall bladder... it had several adhesions. 
 Oh. 
 It had fatty tissues. It had... 
 You did good work. 
 Uh-huh. Then why are you here? 
 To offer you the job of chief resident. 
 Uh, last time I checked, Reid had that job. 
 She needs some time. 
 Well, does she know? 
 Not yet. (sighs) 
 Uh, it's what I wanted, just not how I wanted to get it. 
 I know the feeling. 
 It's yours if you want it. 
 I do. 
 You're a terrific surgeon. 
 (pats arm) You'll do great. 
 She's dysphasic. She called flowers "shoes." 
 Dysphasia indicates a brain tumor. 
 But Hodgkin's lymphoma doesn't recur in the brain. 
 Well, then she doesn't have Hodgkin's. 
 But she does. 
 Dr. Macilreath diagnosed her with it. 
 Well, then there's an error in the pathology report on the biopsy. 
 What? 
 (papers rustling) 
 Alex, look at this. 
 This report shows features that are compatible with a-a high-grade malignant glioma. 
 So she was misdiagnosed? 
 Sample size is too small. I can't tell. 
 We need to get a brain C.T. right now. 
 (telephone keys click) 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Time for a break? 
 I was thinking we could try that hill down by the ravine, bet the grass gets really slick. 
 A little tray sledding? 
 Thought we made a mistake. 
 We did, but I want to be your friend. 
 Maggie... (sighs) I'm sorry. 
 I can't do this. 
 (files rustle) 
 (telephone rings in distance) 
 I'm not gonna lie to you. 
 This is harder than it looks. (chuckles) 
 Well, you haven't moved your legs in almost two years. 
 It's gonna be a process. 
 Yeah. I shouldn't push it. Is that what you're saying? 
 Uh-huh. Look, I can't help it. 
 God is working through me. (laughs) 
 Nadia, I would like to talk to you about what you're suffering... what you're actually suffering. 
 Have you heard of something called "conversion disorder"? 
 No. 
 Sometimes after a trauma, we'll do anything to protect ourselves, like if it it's something we really don't want to deal with, like the, uh, the loss of a loved one, we might make up a story, something to deflect our attention from what's really going on. 
 You lost your husband Alfred, right? 
 Yes. 
 I know the grief from that must have been enormous. 
 Did you ever talk to anybody about it? 
 I talked to god. 
 Every day. 
 Did you ever talk to anybody professional about it? 
 I... 
 I had too much stuff to deal with... 
 Uh, the loss of my legs, my wheelchair. 
 I-I didn't have time to think... 
 (panting) 
 (voice breaking) ab... about, uh... 
 Getting your legs back isn't gonna be easy physically or emotionally. 
 (crying) 
 Now listen to me. 
 We have a great counselor here at Hope Zion, a-and I'm gonna put you in touch with him. 
 You've got a glioma, Bea. 
 A mass in the left parietal lobe of your brain. 
 The cancer... it's in my brain? 
 Yes. 
 But I was g... 
 I was gonna go around the world. I was gonna see the Antarctic. 
 How could this happen? 
 We think, when you were diagnosed four years ago, the pathology was wrong. 
 You see, you were treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, when you should have been treated for T-cell lymphoma, but we get you the right treatment now, and-and you can beat this thing. 
 (sniffles) 
 I'm scared. (chuckles) 
 Of course you are, Bea, but it'll be okay. 
 (sniffles) 
 I'll be with you every step of the way, okay? 
 (sighs) 
 So I'll take you down to oncology. 
 I called your parents. 
 (sniffling, inhales deeply) 
 They'll meet us down there. 
 (sighs) Okay. 
 (whispers) Okay. 
 (sighs) 
 I was the girl's oncologist. 
 How did I miss it? 
 (sighs) We all miss a few, Mack. 
 But I was arrogant, wasn't I? 
 I was  so  sure she had Hodgkin's. 
 All the signs were pointing to it. 
 I might have signed that girl's death warrant if it weren't for you today. (switches clicking) 
 I guess it's time. 
 (sighs) I'm not ready, Mack. 
 Don't worry. It's not your time. 
 What? 
 You're still breathing up there. You're still alive. 
 Push past the familiar thinking. 
 Just because the ventilator's been turned off doesn't mean you have to die. 
 Then what was all this for? 
 You were here to help me. 
 And look. 
 (echoing voice) I wonder what happens now. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 I'm not going anywhere, Alex, believe me. 
 I'm staying right here. 
 (sighs) 
 Alex, I know you're upset with me. 
 I just... I don't want to argue. 
 Okay, listen, just put your hand on his chest. 
 (sighs) I heard how he's doing. 
 No, please. Just come over here and put your hand on his chest. Please. 
 (sighs) 
 Do you feel that? Do you feel how strong it is? 
 His respiratory rate's within normal parameters. 
 He's breathing normally, Dawn. It's almost been 24 hours, and he's breathing just like you and me. 
 (whispers) How is that possible? 
 Something's changed. 
 It has. 
 (sighs) 
 (blows air) Okay. 
 (blows air) 
 (sighs) 
 (whispers) Yes. (giggles) 
 Think you killed the patient. 
 You turned him into rubber. 
 I cut off his torso. 
 He wouldn't answer any of my questions. 
 How many times have you run through that? 
 Oh, I don't know. (chuckles) About 10,000. 
 You know, everyone has a tough intubation. 
 Hell, when I started, I had a tough couple dozen. (sighs) 
 Then one day, they just start to happen. 
 You know, it's like, you... you believe you can do it, and then one day, you just can. 
 So you're not angry? 
 No, I'm not angry. You did a great job today. 
 You know, I did tell you we had it covered, though. 
 I knew you didn't mean it. 
 Uh-huh. 
 (laughs) 
 So you ready for dinner? 
 Dawn. Yes. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 I will see you around, Dr. Reid. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 (sighs) 
 He shouldn't be D.N.R. 
 (chuckles) 
 Will you do whatever needs to be done legally? 
 Of course. 
 Not tomorrow, Dawn. Right now. 
 Yeah. 
 (Andy Brown's "lovesick lullaby" playing) 
 (voice breaks) Take care of him. 
 I promise. 
 The diagnosis... 
 Hey, mom? 
 Is just the beginning. 
 Yeah. (lowered voice) Hey, guess what? 
 You can take good news... 
 Guess who just got promoted to chief res? 
 And run with it... 
 (door closes) 
 Yeah. That's right. (chuckles) Hey, is dad there? 
 Yeah, yeah, put him on. 
 (chuckles) Don't tell him. Just put him on. 
 Or you can take bad news...

 Shahir, I was thinking, since we found out that Bea was misdiagnosed, maybe we did the same thing to Charlie. 
 He's still breathing. Maybe he was always breathing, we just didn't see it because he was ventilated. 
 What if there's something else going on in Charlie's brain?

 You mean, what if it's not just a diffuse axonal injury?
