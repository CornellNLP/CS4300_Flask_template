♪ mm ♪ Mel. Hey, you. Charlie's lungs are a little crackly. Since when? His latest scan would have been... Thursday, and it was clear. I'm not hearing things. Can we order another X-ray, Mel? I'm telling you, they're crackly. I'm working emerg tonight. Page me as soon as you know? You just finished a shift. You're starting another one? Yep. Pneumonia. Perfect. And so it begins. You smell amazing. You're making my palms sweat. Well, you should probably get that checked out. Uh, I'm expecting Mr. Travers to come out of traction anytime, so as soon as he does... I'll page you. Don't worry. Right. The full spinal reconstruction. It's all about the glory with you. Have a fun night, rock star. I'll try and get there later. Are those fancy jeans? (sighs) Shahir's birthday party. You're not coming along? I picked up a night shift. I think you're working too hard. I have to get somebody To cover some of Charlie's coma arousal therapy. It costs money. So where's the thing? Some place called "El Convento"... Rico? Really? Yeah. You're going to El Convento Rico? I am. Do you know it? You're gonna love it. You're a little underdressed, though. (chuckles) (baby crying in distance) Oh. Hi. You look like an actual doctor. Um, we've been waiting for two hours, and my husband needs an X-ray. You need to talk to the triage nurse. Oh. I did, and guess what? They told me to wait. I don't suppose you take bribes. (chuckles) We'll be with you as soon as we can. Okay. Hey. Hey. How's Charlie doing? I don't want to talk about it. I'm here to work. Then the E.R. is the place for you. Treat 'em and street 'em. Ha. Well, there's some stuff in the middle there, too. Looks like a nice, quiet Saturday night. Which you have just jinxed. I'm a capricorn. I don't believe in jinxes. Well, I am an E.R. doctor, and I don't believe in quiet nights. Dr. Miller? Major trauma. Two minutes out. Get it up on the board. Capricorn, huh? (siren wailing) (radio chatter) Patient's name's Eddie. Mid-20s. B.P. 60 on palp. Any meds on board? No. We bolused 2 liters of saline. He's lost a buttload of blood. Pressure's still dropping. Must've hit something major. What happened? Stabbing in a nightclub. B.P. 50 systolic. He's crashing. He's not gonna make it up to the O.R. So we do it here. Are you up for that? Hell, yeah. All right. Give him more fluids. 2 units O-neg. Cross and match 4 more. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Ready? Let's do it. (squish) God, I love watching you work. Okay. There's a lot of blood. I am not gonna be seeing the source unless I get control here. Suction. All right. Let's get some more fluids. I'm gonna need some more sponges. Man : I've got it. There it is. Inferior vena cava. (monitor beeping erratically) No wonder he's bleeding so much. B.P.'s tankin'. We're losing him. (monitor emits continuous tone) No pulse. Damn it. You got enough pressure on there? Yes. Uh, keep pouring fluids. All right. Start compressions. Push 1 of epi. Vascular loupes. And right on cue. (grunts) Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Little guy, slow down! (panting) Where the hell am I? You're in a hospital in surgery. You were knifed. Nothing. Still flat. Zach : Keep going. Keep going. No way. Seriously? That's me? Yeah, and you're about to die. I'm sorry. You probably don't want to watch this part. No. No, no, no. This isn't gonna happen, okay? They gotta do something. Alex : There's too much blood. Come on! Do something! They can't hear you, Eddie. Okay? It's over. You have to let go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go! I'll mess you up. Come on. Fight! Let's go!  Fight! (monitor beeping rhythmically) Got it. I've got a pulse. (sighs) Okay. We're back. How'd you do that? I'm gonna start looking for other injuries. More suction, please. (suction gurgles) Well, he's breathing, barely. Good. I just sent the cops up to I.C.U. Well, they're gonna have to wait. He's in a coma. That was fun, though. So what's next? Reid the machine. I love it. You're a hockey fan, right? Rabid. (lowered voice) 1: 00. Just like that one. (chuckles) Yeah. (lowered voice) Hey, is that Todd Fahey? (singsongy) In the flesh, and he's all yours. (chuckles) Or even that... Mr. Fahey. Hi. I'm Dr. Reid. I have to say, you look a lot smaller without the shoulder pads and the skates. I could still take you, doc. I don't know. Three older brothers. St. Catharines. No way! I'm Grimsby. I know. I'm Amanda. Hi. Could you scootch in a sec? Twitpic. Todd has, like, 82,000 followers. No, I cannot scootch. So what hurts? Uh, you know, everywhere. (men grunting, clatter) Hey. Hey. You guys, break it up. (grunts) Security! Did you hear the lady? Alex : Security! You like that, huh? You like that? (grunts) (grunts) (man groans) Man : All right. Get 'em out of here. It's... what I do. Get back in that bed. It's what I do. Hey, Sparky. Hey. So you're going to Dr. Hamza's thing tonight? I was thinking we could maybe share a cab if you weren't already, um, unless you were going with, um... Who? I think you might be seeing Dr. Goran. Joel. I'm sure you'd be on a first name basis. Mm. No, I'm not. Not on a first name basis? Not seeing him. Okay. Are you sure? Gavin... Because it's cool if you are. I... I'm not. Yes, I will be there, but not till later. You can buy me a drink. Okay? Okay. Great. (singsongy) We're gonna go dancing. (hums) Todd took me out to this Argentinean place on Harbord. Unbelievable steak. So good. Anyways, we're walking back to the car, and this yahoo starts jawing at me. Why do people think they can just because they see him on TV? I mean, you do as much fighting as I do for a living, everybody and their drunk uncle wants to take a run at you, right? And this guy did? Mm. It was ridiculous. And Todd is refusing to fight back. I kind of have, like, a policy, you know, no civilians. So we're walking away, and he sucker punches Todd, back of the head. Todd goes down... Kicks me in the ribs. The guy takes off. I wanted to kill this guy with my shoe. And she would have, too, if I'd let her. A little crazy. (groans) That hurts? Yeah, when you're poking at it, it does, and when I laugh and when she breathes. I think you have a cracked rib, maybe two. I'm gonna order a chest X-ray, make sure there are no punctures. Right on. What about your head? You said that he punched you. Yeah, my head's fine. You don't need to worry about my head. Todd, can you look at me for a second? Can you tell me what day of the week it is? It's Saturday. And I'm gonna tell you some numbers. I want you to repeat them to me backwards. Nine, four, seven, two. We don't need to do this, Dr. Reid. I'm worried that you have... Concussion. Yeah. See, that's a "c" word. I've been through this routine before, doc. I really think we should just leave that one alone. You need a C.T. scan. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Todd... Seriously, just-just drop it. Okay. I will. For now. But just so you know, this is my home ice. Yes, ma'am. (dance music playing) ♪ (woman) ♪ just put your hand in mine ♪ ♪ leaving self-control behind ♪ ♪ let's do it super slow ♪ 
♪ so, baby, don't let go ♪ Cool spot. Yeah. So how does it feel to be out? What do you mean, like feather-boa-tiara out? No, I'm not implying that. I just mean 'cause you work a lot. Hey, hey! Colleagues! Men of Hope Zion, life is good. Let us live it. You can take mine. Thanks. (glass clatters) Oh. I get one day off every two months. Let's make it count. Go for your life. (singsongy) Here he is... the man of the hour! Gavin and Tom : Hey! Whoa! Just don't ask him how old he is. I'm 32. Hey. ♪ why don't you set me free? ♪ Oh. Am I the only one drinking? I'm on call. I'm lame and inhibited. I'm in recovery, and he's muslim. Mazel tov! (man over P.A.) Let's hear it for our dancers! (cheering) Guys, I had no idea about this. I am so sorry. For what? What? Please welcome to the stage the voluptuous Dyna Thirst! (cheering) All right. Listen up, bitches, because tonight is my favorite night of the year... Rico's annual best ass... (singsongy) competition! Whoo! I have a nice bum. (snickers) We all got pretty athletic builds, right? We're a good-looking bunch. I'm gonna find out how we enter this competition. Ah. Go get 'em. Hey. Hey. Ever heard of a diagnostic blood test for a concussion? For the hockey player? He refuses to get a C.T. scan. Fights for a living. One more concussion, and his career's over. He knows this. I found a study in "pubmed"... a diagnostic blood test the military was working on in Afghanistan. It's worth a shot. I thought so. Hmm. (man coughs) (sighs) So check this. There seems to be two camps... friends of the stabbed guy and the guys that did the stabbing. Uh-oh. Yeah. You should boot 'em, all of 'em. I tried, but they've all got something wrong with them. It's a nice, quiet Saturday night. Not my fault. Yes, it is. (cell phone buzzing) Olivia, I'm gonna need you to get the cops down here. I got your page. You were right. Charlie has pneumonia. What's his temp? Just over 100. I have him sitting up. He needs I.V. antibiotics. I know. You need to carpet-bomb his lungs. Melanda, it could get worse. Alex, I've got it covered. This can't happen. He could die. That won't happen. I won't do that do you. Why didn't you catch this? What's wrong with you? It just developed. I'm sorry. I know it's not your fault. It's okay. I'm downstairs. Any changes... Eddie : Hey. Hey. Come on. Wake up. Get up. What the hell? Hey. Get up. You. You're back. Yeah. How do I look? Uh, truthfully... not so good. Ah. Um, you seem to be in a coma. Yeah? Yeah, you're not coming back from the anesthetic. My guess is you were hypotensive too long. So what's with the monkey suit? Are you, like, a funeral guy? A matter of speaking. See, that's me over there. I'm also in a coma... for the last three weeks... and I have pneumonia. Oh, no way. Yeah, take a turn for the worse and I could die, any moment. Eddie, let me ask you something. Um, before, in surgery, how did you pull that off? What? In the E.R., you were dead on the table. You were a goner. And then all of a sudden, you weren't. How-how did you do that? Hey, if you learn to fight in a club and, uh, you got punched in the face really hard, you'd go to the hospital, right? Sure. Like emergency, E.R. Where is that? Is that right through here? Eddie! (laughs) These are my boys right here. What's up, gentlemen? And over here... the punk who stabbed me. Friend of yours? I'm a businessman, right? Crystal meth, a little bit of oxy. This guy starts selling in my club. I tell him to back off, and he stabs me. Makes perfect sense. Yeah, not before I broke his fricking jaw, though. Now he can't hear or see me, right? Not a thing. I'm coming after you. As soon as I wake up, I'm gonna return the favor and I'm gonna chop you into little pieces. You're a real sweetheart, you know that, Eddie? Hey, I don't lose a fight, okay, not ever. And then I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna kill your family, all of your friends, and your stupid little dog! (curtain rings whoosh) Break it up. Uh, sorry, doc. (giggles) Okay, Todd, you have a cracked rib, no punctures, no bleed. You were lucky. Cool. And no treatment either, right? Just gonna give you some medication for the pain. Perfect. Dr. Reid, it's been a real pleasure, and I got two tickets at the red line with your name on it. Baby, let's make like a banana... And split. Mm-hmm. I just need your arm. I'm gonna run a blood panel, check for infection. Um, infection of what? Uh, I'm not bleeding. Ow. Just covering my tracks on the off chance that I missed something. Oxygen levels and so forth. No offense, doc. You're a real lousy card player. She's just trying to help you. Done. It's just gonna be another half-hour. (snorts) I don't think so. Baby, let's go. Todd, wait. I haven't discharged you. You could try and restrain me... But I don't like your chances. Todd. Thanks, doc. See you later. Tickets are in the mail. Come on, baby. Let's go. So it's good? Man : Yeah. Should be all right. Todd, listen to me. I understand that you don't want to deal with... (gunshots) (patients screaming) (grunts) Zach, get in here! (beep)  (woman) Code orange. Waiting room. (alarm blaring)  Code orange. Waiting room. Gunshot wound to the abdomen. Did anyone else get hit? Help! I need some help here! Go. Go. I got him. I got him. I got him. (baby crying) Easy. Easy. It's okay. Call the code! I need a trauma team now! (siren wails) (police radio chatter) Fentanyl, 100 mics. Spike a bag of saline. All right. What happened? You were shot. What's her name? Irene. Is she going to be okay? I can't move my legs. Try not to move anything, Irene. Just lie still. No chest or upper extremity wounds. Single G.S.W. to the midline. Heart rate... 110. Pressure 137 on 88. Seems to be a little stressed. Can you blame her? Let's check for exit wounds. Roll her on three. One, two, three. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Nothing in the back. And back. Ready? Bullet must be lodged in the pelvis or the spine. Anthony? I'm here, honey. I'm here, sweetie. You're gonna be just fine. They're gonna take good care of you. We good to go? Go. Let's go. There's no time to waste, guys. Order a C.T. and tell 'em we're on our way. Woman : Got it. And page Dr. Goran. Yep. I know. (cheering) ♪ Okay, well, can you speak a little louder? Tell me... what are the injuries? So she says I'm too scrawny. They're interested in  you, Dr. Goran. Okay, I'll get there as soon as I can. I'm sorry, mate. What? They want to see you in the lineup. There's been a shooting in the O.R. Is everybody okay? Who was shot? Two patients. Everything's under control, but, uh, I gotta bail. Were there any brain injuries... by chance? You're not going anytime soon, are you? Nah, I'm in it for the long haul. Shahir, come on. (scoffs) ♪ Shahir. Cheers. Tom : Happy birthday. (coughs) ♪ The bullet didn't exit. Visceral damage? Just the liver and minor. Missed the aorta. 1/8 of an inch to the right, she would've bled out. Bullet's lodged in the T11. Is the spinal cord transected? Can't tell from the C.T. there's too much artifact. You gotta know how to read these things. And I don't? She's got bony fragments. It's gotta be impinging on the spine. Any family? Her husband, outside. You don't think you're being a little hasty? Just put her in an I.C.U. Wait till she stabilizes, then operate. Is that what you'd do? She's lost a lot of blood. You don't even know if her cord is intact. But hey, you're the surgeon. Yes, I am. Thank you. I'll take it from here. Good. Come on, you b*st*rd. Die already. Sorry, bud. Your friend here is stable. Looks like he's gonna make it. He just got shot! Yeah, and the bullet went out of its way to avoid anything vital. He should be up and around in a couple of days or so. I need to wake up. How much longer till I wake up? Eddie, you're in a coma, okay? Get out of my way! What's that? (laughs) Which way to my body? I.C.U., right? Well, I could show you. 
 
 Hey, Eddie! Wr-wrong way. How much longer, detective? As long as it takes. We got a lot of patients to treat. I know you're used to flashing that badge around, but sick people... I need more time. You're still here. Yeah, we have to give statements. They're doing Amanda first. So you're hiding out? Yes. (chuckles) You know, doc, uh, if I were more paranoid, I would say that you staged that entire thing just to keep me around. (chuckles) Uh-oh. Here it comes. (sighs deeply) Todd, your blood work indicated raised protein levels in your bloodstream. You tested positive for U.C.H.L.1 and G.F.A.P. You have a concussion, a traumatic brain injury. No kidding. I'm guessing this isn't the first one. You need a C.T. scan. We need to know what's going on. All right. (sighs) Look... (inhales deeply) My first year at junior, all right, my coach... he takes me out for a beer after practice and he tells me, "Todd, there are two ways" "you get into the NHL. One is your talent." "The other is your fists." Then he looks me right in the eyes and says, "Todd..." "You don't have the talent." Well... I'm 35 years old, doc. Not a bone in my body that doesn't hurt. So stop. I can't. Even if it could kill you? (sighs deeply) I made it good, doc. All right? Where I come from, my family, that just doesn't happen. Ever since day one, I've been supporting, like, 12 different people. The way I figure it is I got one, maybe two seasons left, which is why I'm asking you, like, just-just please just leave it. You don't... you don't need to... You're up. Cops are so excited to meet you. (chuckles) Cool. It's okay. I can wait. How's it going? It's going. Anthony. I'm Dr. Goran. I'll be operating on your wife. Oh, uh, how-how is she? Good news is, the bullet didn't do any significant damage to her internal organs. Okay. But it has done damage to her spine. Now what I'd like to do is to operate immediately. We decompress the spinal cord, stabilize the spine. There are risks. Like what? She's unstable. It's a long and complicated surgery. If it doesn't go well, she could die. Now look, I've done this before, several times, and I have been successful. Are there other options? Yes. We could wait. We could take her to the I.C.U., let her get her strength back, and then go in. Now this is less risky, but in the meantime, any chance she has of recovering function in her legs will gradually disappear. She'll be paralyzed? She could very well be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, yes. W... We're not even from here. You know, I mean, we... come through once a month on the way to the casino... Like I said before, Anthony, I'm confident in success. I-I need to speak with my wife, okay? Can I... can I just talk to her, please? Yeah. Of course. You should talk it over with your wife. So we're on the road, right, this hotel in Florida. I'm on the elevator and I got my dog with me. His name is Probert. I love my dog. Husky/lab mix. Right. The doors open up. These two old ladies get on. They're looking all nervous, man. They see me standing there, this big, ugly, scary dude. I got my big, ugly, scary dog, right? (giggles) So I'm looking at Probert. I tell him, I'm like, "sit." He doesn't listen to me, so I'm like, "sit!" (laughs) These two old ladies, man, they sit down on the floor in the elevator. Oh, my. So anyways, I just... (laughs) bought them dinner, gave them tickets to the game, blah, blah, blah. But you should've seen these old birds, man. They just sat! (Amanda laughs) Guys, if you don't mind... Thank you. Oh, cops love Todd. He always speeds. Never gets a ticket. (laughing) Babe, it's not that funny. I ca... Todd? I can't talk. Todd! Todd! Man : Can we get some help over here? Babe. What's happening? Todd. Can you help him? (electronic music playing) You should've asked me if I wanted a party. It was a surprise. Shahir, if I had told you, it wouldn't have been one. We've been dating for a year and a half? Hmm? What part of you... tell me... thought that I would like a surprise theme party? It's not a theme party. No, it's a drag show. You know what your problem is? You're a self-hating narcissist... Oh, please. Who doesn't want your alpha surgeon buddies to know that you enjoy a-a nice drag show once in a while. It's not about gay, Victor. It's about people. Large groups of people... they... fill me with anxiety, and the fact that you don't get that after a year and a half... (cell phone rings) just... hospital. Of course it is. Dr. Hamza. (scoffs) ♪ Okay. I'm on my way. Happy birthday, Shahir. Okay. (indistinct conversations) (Irene speaks indistinctly) Okay, so how are we doing? We're having a disagreement. Can you imagine me in a wheelchair? She wants to have the surgery. I say let's do this. Screw it. Let's roll the dice. You can't win if you don't play. Sweetheart, we are talking about your life. Dr. Goran, you've done this procedure before? Yes. And it worked? Yes. And in your opinion, it will work again? I have no reason to think that it won't. This is what she does. You see, she browbeats. Dr. Goran, so what you're saying is if it was you, you'd have the surgery? Yes, I would. I need some more time. Can-can we please just take a little time... Anthony. It will be okay. Dr. Goran is the expert. Charlie : Eddie? Eddie? Where are you? You were right here. Charlie! Dude, I'm-I'm totally lost, and, uh, and that's not I.C.U. It's... No, it's not even close. So where is it? You're gonna leave a brother hanging? Well, it's down that w... Ha! Too slow! (laughs) Not fair! Not fair! Hmm. His brain is atrophied, a number of concussions. No fractures. There's a contusion there, but that's not the cause of the bleed. Aneurysm? There's actually three. He's a walking time bomb. Is that what caused the laughing? Pseudobulbar affect. His neural pathways are disrupted. He can't control his emotions. Hell of a way to spend your birthday. Couldn't imagine anything better. Hey, champ. You ready? I take it all back. I'm kind of freaking out here. So whatever you guys gotta do, just, I don't know, just do it. Don't worry. You're in the best hands. (exhales deeply) Here you go, doctor. Mm-hmm. Here we go. Placing the temporary clip now. There. Start the timer. (beeping) Thank you. (indistinct conversations) Amanda? He, uh, came in here with a few bruised ribs, and now he's having brain surgery. I keep begging him to quit hockey. Dr. Reid, what am I going to do if he doesn't wake up? I think... he will. He will. Okay. There's a benefit to letting the fever run its course. I know. It'll kill off bacteria, help his defenses. We should be stingy with antibiotics. We don't know what's coming. What are you looking at? It's almost midnight. After three weeks, only 4% of coma patients regain consciousness. As of this moment, Charlie's in week four. That's a fake deadline, and you know it. He's not in a coma anymore. He's officially P.V.S. No, he isn't. Persistent vegetative state. You know what? Don't even. Nothing has changed. Besides, I like to think of it as minimally conscious. (siren wailing in distance) (clears throat) (sighs) Who keeps drinking all my caffeine? Maggie, guaranteed. Right. Shouldn't you be in surgery? (sighs) The husband's refusing to sign off on this. It's just... it's ridiculous. I mean, he doesn't seem to get it's incredibly time-sensitive. You know, if we don't decompress that... maybe he doesn't care. He doesn't care if she can walk again? Yeah. I think the risks are entire manageable. Well, yeah, for you. Listen to yourself. You're just pissed off because you wanna show off, and they're not playing along. But guess what, Joel? This isn't about you. Hey. He just wants her to live. He doesn't care what shape she's in, and any risk is too much. He just wants her to live. A-Alex! (siren wailing) So... do you wanna watch it? (door opens) Sure. Yeah? (chuckles) (chuckles) It'll be good. Yeah? How are you feeling? Uh... good, I think? How'd that go for you guys? (chuckles) This is Dr. Hamza. He did your surgery. We've just been searching "brain surgery." Yeah. Yeah. It turns out that I could have, like, a pretty fast recovery, right? I mean, a couple weeks, I'll be right as rain. Did everything go okay? You had a brain aneurysm. In fact, you had three. One of them ruptured, which caused a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which led to your seizure. Okay. You were lucky. It was a small one. But the problem is, we couldn't get them all. There's one we couldn't touch, and it could burst at any time, so... You can't do anything? Well, he's gonna have to be careful. You're gonna have to be careful, Todd, for the rest of your life. One slight knock to the head might... well, it might kill you. (sighs) Well, I guess that's why they make helmets, right? Todd, I'm sorry. Your career is over. (indistinct conversations) (telephone ringing, monitor beeping steadily) Still rising. 105. It'll break. Charlie's a fighter. Yeah. Hey, baby. Fight! Yo! Let's go! Don't be a little punk! I'll mess you up! Come on! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! What? It worked before. Well, keep trying. Knock yourself out. Wake up! Hey, answer me this. Say this does work. What are you gonna do then? What do you think? I'm gonna find the bitch who stabbed me, and I'm gonna kill his ass. Right, at which point his friends are gonna find you and kill your ass. That's what I think. What do you even know about fighting? You've totally given up. No, I haven't. Really? That's, um... That's not you giving up? Okay, tough guy. Come on. Sit up. Wake up. Come on. Get up. Fight. (claps hands) I'll mess you up. Come on! (coughing and panting) (gagging, coughing continues) Are you kidding me? Is that my vena cava? He sounds like he's back with us. (continues coughing) Okay. Settle down there. Okay. It's all right. It's okay. I got him. All right. Eddie? Eddie, look at me. It's okay. You're okay, Eddie. (beeping) Eddie, you're all right. Jackson, we need to sedate him. Give me 5 milligrams of midazolam. Jackson : On it. Eddie, I'm gonna take this out. Tell margaret no bingo on Tuesday. Oh, and don't forget to change my hair appointment. The number's in the phone. Honey, we can talk about all that later on. No, we can't, because you'll forget, and I'll be as high as a kite. Okay, I'm sorry, but this is as far as you go. But I'll find you as soon as we're done. Hey. Come here. I love you like crazy. (kisses) (sniffles) Okay. (sighs) I love you. Dr. Goran. Don't let her die. We'll take the very best care of her. No, you don't understand. I can't-I can't lose her. Man : Richard, give me a hand, please. (telephone rings) So we're taking an anterior approach. It's a long incision with significant anticipated blood loss. Gonna remove the ninth rib, avoid the aorta, and get the bullet and bone fragments out of the canal. Knife, please. Dr. Goran? (sighs) Okay, change of plan. Too risky. So... posterior approach. We'll leave the bullet in. We'll stabilize the spine, then close. Okay. She needs time. Get your hands off me. Don't... I want to get out of here. You need to get back... Whoa, whoa, Todd. Seriously, don't, okay? You know what? Screw you. Screw you. I'm getting out of here. Todd, you just had surgery. I said get out of my face! Hey! This is not okay, doc. You understand? (clatter) I got nothing else in my life. Nothing! You need to get back in that bed now. He's rattled by the surgery. It's normal. Would you like me to order restraints, Todd? Because I will. You know what, Dr. Reid? I gotta go back to playing hockey next year, and I don't care what you think about it. What I think about it? Is you're an idiot. You're alive. You have a life for as long as it lasts and a woman who loves you. And anyone who is breathing and conscious who can see and touch the woman sitting next to him and turns his back on that, on  her...  is an idiot. (woman) ♪ ooh, la-la ♪ Not even kidding. Hey, Mags, your phone's ringing. What? Your phone. Who is it? "Joel." First name basis, huh? Must be a medical consult. Yeah. He wants to play doctor with you. (beep) Dr. Goran, hello. Last call isn't till 2: 00. Yeah, you should totally come by. Yeah, I'll be here. (beep) Medical consult, huh? What? Whoo! Cheers to you. ♪ ooh, la-la ♪ Ahh. (laughs)  ♪ sing ooh-la-la-la-la ♪ 
♪ Hey, you got something to eat? I'm starving. I'm thinking a double cheeseburger, supersize fries, maybe a chocolate shake. Really? I'm thinking jell-o, cottage cheese. (chuckles) Come on. Let's go. I'll mess you up. Fight. Come on. (grunts) Come on! Let's go! I'm gonna mess you up! Come on, Charlie. Come on. Fight. (monitor beeping steadily, ventilator whooshing) Fight. Melanda? Fever's broken. I was just about to call you. He got through it, Alex. (chuckles) It's the middle of the night. Go get some rest. Yeah. You, too. And, uh, thank you, Mel. (kisses) How'd it go? I backed off. Good. I figured that's what Charlie would have done, right? Yeah. It's a little thing called disseminated intravascular coagulation. This guy was bleeding out of his catheter. His nasogastric line, his endotracheal line, his, uh, his central line, and that was my very first day as a resident. Charlie. If we didn't work together, do you think we'd be... Yeah, I think so. I mean... it's what we have in common. We're doctors. It's our connection, right? You know you frown first thing in the morning before you open your eyes, out of protest? And the way your voice goes soft and shy when you're nervous, And you grab hold of my hand and you hold it real tight? 'Cause you hate being nervous. The way you can start a sentence without having any idea how it's gonna end. (laughs) (sighs) And the way you can just stop moving... and that power in your stillness. And the way you're looking at me right now. You want me to keep going, or... I want you to call a cab. Right now? Right now. Go! Don't-don't... Hurry. Hurry! Taxi! (laughs) Taxi! (voice echoes) Come on, Alex. Alex. (whispering) Charlie. Hi. (gasps) Are you okay? You look like you just saw a ghost. Charlie... he was.. Charlie? He was... he was what? Nothing. I, uh, nothing. Alex, maybe you should rest. Come on. Why don't you lie down and get some rest? Yeah. Yeah. Try and get some sleep. I'll come wake you in half an hour. Okay. Okay.
