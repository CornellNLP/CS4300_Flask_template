 (siren blares) 
 "Carlos Garcia, acute abdominal pain, right lower quadrant." 
 Just came in from the airport... emergency landing. 
 Dr. Miller. 
 Uh... 
 Go. I got this. 
 (whispers) Okay. (curtain rings rattle) 
 Mr. Garcia, I'm Dr. Reid. I'm a surgical resident. 
 Hey. 
 You're feeling some pain? 
 (gasps) A little bit, yeah. 
 Do you mind lifting up your shirt for me, please? 
 Now this might be a little tender, all right? 
 (gags) 
 Looks to me like a ruptured appendix. 
 And you are... 
 Mark Wilson. I'm a G.P. I was on the same flight. 
 You got off the plane with him? 
 Yeah, well, I wanted to see it through, do the hand-off. 
 Oh! (coughs) 
 We'll start him on a liter of ringers and 80 milligrams gentamicin. 
 You're having trouble breathing, Carlos? 
 Chest cold. Got it last week. 
 Just try to sit forward for me a little bit, please. Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And just one deep breath. 
 (inhales sharply) 
 (exhales sharply) Okay. 
 You're a little wheezy. 
 His temp is up to 103. 
 It's been steadily climbing. 
 Dr. Wilson is right. 
 You probably have a ruptured appendix. 
 There are signs of peritonitis, but I won't know for sure till I'm in there. 
 We're going to get you straight into surgery, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Great. (curtain rings rattle) 
 Listen, um, mind if I stick around? 
 My flight's not for another six hours. 
 I'd kind of like to see this through. 
 (child cries in distance) 
 (sighs) Imaging, and to the O.R. Fast, okay? Thanks. 
 Imagine that Charlie's a car that's been parked in the garage all winter. 
 Technically, everything's in working order, but for some unknown reason, he's refusing to start. 
 Just needs a boost. 
 Never fails... any time physical labor's involved, Shahir just disappears. 
 What is that? 
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation. 
 A little juice in the old caboose. 
 You're serious? 
 I am. 
 It delivers alternating and pulsing electromagnetic field to Charlie's prefrontal cortex. 
 Best-case scenario, he wakes up. 
 Worst-case scenario, he has a seizure. 
 Don't worry. We'll keep the frequency low to start. 
 And right on cue. 
 Thank you, Shahir, for all your excellent help. 
 Please disregard Victor's tone. We're having a disagreement. 
 He's seeing his mother tonight, and he didn't invite me. 
 Didn't even tell me she was in town. 
 Which is really not a big deal, Victor. 
 I have never met his mother... in almost two years, not once... but yeah, no, that's not a big deal. 
 I'm sorry. That was inappropriate. 
 Only slightly. 
 (cell phone vibrates) 
 Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Can you... 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 Thank you. 
 (beeps) 
 Okay. If I'm stuck... maybe this will unstick me. 
 So last Thursday, I was convinced I had a glioma. 
 This week, it's skin cancer. 
 I'm just paranoid. Tell me I'm just paranoid. 
 Medical student's disease... I had it in med school. 
 Thought I had periodontitis, athlete's foot, seasonal disaffective disorder. 
 Yeah, none of those can kill you, though. 
 All right. Let's see this suspicious freckle. 
 It's probably just sunburn, right? 
 I don't know. I want to get out the bucket list. 
 Shut up. You're in psych. What do you know? 
 Maggie. Hey. Have you, um... This is Hannah. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 So I'll see you later? 
 You will, unless I die of a malignant melanoma. Mm! 
 (giggles) 
 She seems fun. 
 Yeah. She is. She's-she's super fun. 
 I'm happy for you, Gav... seeing someone. 
 Seeing someone? No. Hannah and I... we're just friends. 
 Super. 
 No C.T.? 
 It was backed up... 
 And the ultrasound's murky. Look at that. 
 Oh. 
 No known allergies, no history of heart or lung disease... piece of cake. 
 Hey, so Charlie's doing better. 
 Touch wood. 
 Heard about the T.M.S. (sniffles) 
 There have been studies. It might work. 
 You're impressive, Reid. 
 You've never given up on Charlie. I admire that. 
 (exhales sharply) 
 Do you have a second? 
 I do not. 
 Hey. I want to be friends again. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm sorry I made it weird. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Yes. 
 Stop avoiding me? 
 (door opens) 
 Dr. Pratt needs help. 
 Spoke too soon? 
 I keep losing sight of the cords. Give me some burp. 
 I got it. 
 Sats are falling. You gotta bag him. 
 No, I don't, not yet. 
 That's it. Right there. Hold that. 
 Okay. 
 Tube. 
 (coughs) 
 Easy. 
 It's okay. It's just reflex. Little more. 
 (coughs) 
 Okay, use the stylet. 
 Quiet. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Nearly there. 
 That's it. 
 I got it. 
 That's nicely done. 
 Out. 
 Okay. See you later. 
 Victor : There we go. 
 Okay. Volumes are coming back up. We're good to go. 
 All right. I have to scrub in. 
 Get him prepped, and have suction and irrigation ready, 'cause if his appendix is already blown, he's gonna be full of pus. 
 Okay. 
 I'm far too young to get spinal stenosis. I looked it up. 
 Normally, people are in their 60s. 
 It's just bad luck, pure and simple. 
 There's no other explanation. 
 And if you had to rate your pain today, on a scale of one to ten, what would it be? 
 17. 
 I'm kidding. It's ten. 
 Okay. 
 On the other hand, today is an auspicious day. 
 It's my mother's birthday... may she rest in peace... and the numbers in the day add up to 25, which is the day my cat was born, so... 
 Mm. 
 June 25th. 
 Lucky. 
 It is. I'm encouraged. 
 Good morning, Carol. How are you doing? (sighs) 
 I'm a little anxious. 
 Of course you are. 
 That's perfectly normal. Dr. Lin. 
 This is Carol Malone. 
 She's in for a posterior lumbar decompression to treat her spinal stenosis. 
 She has multiple disc herniations impinging on her nerve roots, which is causing pain in her legs. 
 Ten out of ten. 
 And treatment? 
 Spinal decompression. 
 Uh, okay. 
 So, Carol, uh, we've already talked about what's gonna happen with your surgery. What I'd like to address is... 
 Excuse me, Dr. Goran. May I ask you... (sighs) 
 When you say the words, "surgery," or "pain," would you mind repeating them three times? 
 Carol's a little superstitious. 
 I know... it sounds crazy, but I've had so much bad luck, that, at this point, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. 
 Of course. Um... 
 So when I do your surgery surgery surgery... (mouths words) 
 I'd like to address the issue of your pain pain pain, by making more room for your spinal cord. 
 Thank you. 
 So I was thinking, this weekend, you and I... we get out of town, maybe take a little field trip of our own... 
 Some b&b, maybe a spa? 
 Can you make sure you check Carol's imaging and bloodwork, including the coagulation profile? 
 Yep. 
 She was really scared, and you made her feel comfortable. 
 You're a good guy, Joel. 
 So what do you say? 
 About... 
 About going away this weekend. 
 Okay, listen to me, Maggie. 
 What? What is it? 
 When we're doing rounds, I ask you to describe me a surgical treatment, I want you to give me more than a couple of words. 
 "Spinal decompression"... that doesn't cut it. 
 Okay. 
 I expect you to walk me through the procedure, step-by-step. 
 Anything else you'd like to share? 
 You're the one who's always asking me for feedback. Okay? 
 Oh. 
 Regarding the, uh, the-the weekend thing... 
 I'm sorry. I'm not gonna be able to get away. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Okay. Blunt nose grasper. 
 That is not what I expected. 
 I have a visual on the appendix, and it looks... totally fine. 
 It's not even inflamed, let alone ruptured. 
 Can you just look around a little bit more, please? 
 No diverticulitis, no purulent fluid... 
 So what's causing the symptoms? 
 That is an excellent question. 
 He's got a distended loop of bowel, maybe a site of infection. 
 (beep) 
 (pratt) I'm having trouble ventilating. 
 Sat's down to 82. 
 B.P.'s falling. Pulse erratic. 
 He's crashing. Are you losing blood? 
 No, nothing. What the hell is happening? 
 Did you check his creatinine levels? 
 Yeah, it was fine... 1: 10. His electrolytes were fine. 
 His gases were all fine at induction. Check his lines. 
 They're good. They're fine. 
 (monitor beeping erratically, emitting continuous tone) 
 Victor : He's coding. 
 Push amioderone. Start defib. Start the clock. 
 Let's lose the drape. 
 Charge to 300. 
 300. 
 All right. 
 (defibrillator whines) 
 Clear. 
 (paddles thunk) 
 No change. 
 I got it, I got it. 
 Sat's are bottoming out. 50 and dropping. 
 B.P. 60 over 40. 
 Oh, come on. Why is this happening? 
 No sinus rhythm. 
 Did you check to see if the tube is in? 
 Did you check the cords? 
 Yes. You must have hit an artery. 
 300. 
 (defibrillator whines) 
 (pants) Clear. 
 (paddles thunk, buzz, beeps) 
 No change. 
 (pants) 
 Are we ready yet? 
 300. 
 (pants) 
 (defibrillator whines) 
 Clear! 
 (paddles thunk) 
 Come on, Garcia. Push epi! 
 Still no change. 
 Come on! (panting) 
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 (monitor emitting continuous tone) 
 Time of death... 2: 04 P.M. 
 (beeps, monitor stops emitting continuous tone) 
 (glove snaps) 
 I went in laparoscopically. I saw no sign of rupture. 
 He had minor bowel distension. 
 Crashed on the table, huh? 
 We couldn't oxygenate him. I pushed amioderone, full defib. 
 B.P. was low when he came in. 
 Yeah, that's right, and his lungs were heavy. 
 My guess... an aggressive bacterial pneumonia. 
 It doesn't fit with his G.I. symptoms. 
 But like you said, an infection, maybe an underlying flu. 
 Mm-hmm. I agree with Dr. Miller. 
 Let's notify the family. 
 I'm gonna need the usual paperwork... full step-by-step from both of you. 
 (blows air) 
 I'm waiting to establish a baseline E.E.G., so we can chart any variation. 
 I'm ready. I'm pumped. Let's let the healing begin! 
 So this does what, exactly? 
 Neuronal depolarization. 
 Basically, it excites the brain. 
 Sounds like fun. 
 Sounds like a way out of this freakin' penguin suit. 
 Okay, that should be long enough. Here we go. 
 Wait, stop. 
 Shouldn't we wait for Alex? 
 I mean, what if he wakes up right now? 
 Oh. Then he wakes up right now. 
 Booyah. 
 (beeps, clicking) 
 Is it working? 
 Hmm. 
 I absolutely have no idea. 
 I don't feel anything. 
 Whoa. 
 Hello, world. I've missed you. 
 (car horns honk in distance) 
 Wait a minute. That's not right. 
 This can't be real. 
 There was an announcement about an hour after takeoff... 
 "is there a doctor on board?" It's my first time. 
 And you examined Mr. Garcia? 
 Yeah. He was short of breath. Abdominal cramps, fever... 
 Coughing? 
 He said he had a cold, but he just seemed to be getting worse, so I convinced them to land the plane. 
 Did he happen to mention where he'd been traveling at all? 
 We didn't talk much. He was in a lot of pain, so... 
 Okay. 
 (sighs) 
 Deep breath. 
 (inhales sharply) 
 (exhales sharply) Honestly, I... 
 I'm just a little tired. It's probably just jet lag. 
 And again. 
 (inhales sharply) 
 (coughs, wheezes, clears throat) 
 Dr. Wilson, you've got wheezes, shallow breathing, And your temp is pushing 102. 
 Really? 
 I'm gonna order an X-ray, okay? 
 I don't have pneumonia. 
 Let's just be sure. 
 (knock on door) 
 Just excuse me for a minute. 
 Sure. 
 (lowered voice) Hey. I found Garcia's boarding passes. 
 He flew out of Mumbai yesterday morning, transferring in Frankfurt. 
 We should check with promed. 
 I did. This was posted 40 minutes ago. 
 The W.H.O. identified a cluster of coronavirus in a village outside of Mumbai. 
 Coronavirus... like S.A.R.S. 
 Yeah. 
 So, uh, let's just get him into isolation till we're sure. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, man. That does not look like a good sign. 
 We think you may have been exposed to a virus, but it's just a precaution, okay? So don't worry. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 Or try not to. 
 (sighs) 
 Carol has disc herniations at L4, 5. 
 You can see them compressing at the L4 nerve root. 
 What is the next step? 
 Retract the nerve root. 
 Mm-hmm. And then? 
 Grasp the disc material and remove it. 
 So go ahead. Extract the root. 
 Retractor. 
 Yep. That's it. Steady. Steady. Okay. Pituitary. 
 Thank you. 
 So what are we worried about here? What are the dangers? 
 There are so many. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You could tear the dura and cause a C.S.F. leak. 
 You could nick an epidural vein. Ooh. Worst case? 
 You could avulse a nerve root and cause paralysis. 
 With Carol's luck, you'll probably do all three. 
 With Carol's luck, you'll probably do all three. 
 Tough crowd. 
 Okay. Irrigation. 
 I'm working three double shifts next week. 
 How does that even happen? 
 Victor. Hi. (clears throat) 
 We need to talk about our previous conversation. 
 What are you still doing here? I thought you went home. 
 Okay, so the reason why I don't invite you to come meet my mother... 
 Is because I have the wrong body parts. I know. 
 N-no, that's not true. 
 Really, Shahir? 
 Your mother wouldn't rather you were straight? 
 Oh, of course she would, but the point is... 
 Shahir, I'm either a part of your life, or I'm not. 
 If I am, you need to... 
 It's because you're a nurse. 
 My mother would rather me marry, you know, another doctor or an architect or a lawyer. 
 You're ashamed of me because I'm a nurse? 
 That's pathetic. You're pathetic. 
 Hey, can you see me? 
 Shahir. Shahir, listen, I don't think this... this whole stimulating thing was a good idea, okay? 
 (car horn honks in distance) 
 (tires screech, crash in distance) 
 This is an aggressive virus. 
 He clearly picked it up from Garcia. 
 There could be other people that are infected, and I think we should shut down the hospital. 
 Let's run some more tests on him. 
 We can't wait for more tests. We have to do this right now. 
 Then we do it now. 
 Great. 
 Hold on. It's two cases. 
 A lockdown could mean massive negative press. 
 Well, I know what it means, Bryan, but... 
 We'll be plague hospital. 
 You're worried about publicity? 
 Let's be sure. 
 And until we are, we close the doors. 
 Listen, the Denver flight is still in the air. 
 They could hold it on the tarmac. 
 The two paramedics who brought Garcia into the hospital are still both here. I checked. 
 Their risk is contained, and there's a chance we can keep it that way. 
 Let's put all surgeries on hold. 
 Divert ambulances, shut down the outpatient clinics, but for now, the doors stay open. 
 (scoffs) 
 (coughs) 
 My phone is dead. I need a charger or another phone. 
 I need to talk to my wife. I have a wife and a daughter. 
 Of course. I'll get you a phone. 
 Try not to worry. We don't know what this is yet. 
 That's the best you got? 
 Could just be a flu. 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) I shouldn't have gotten involved. 
 I should have kept my distance. 
 I don't think that's your style. 
 (chuckles) 
 (coughing and wheezing) 
 Bryan : We're tracking the W.H.O. alert. 
 Our patient flew out of Mumbai early yesterday morning. 
 Great office. Wow. 
 I'm Dr. Kinney. This is Dr. Reid. 
 She operated on Mr. Garcia. 
 Hello. 
 Dr. Peter Hibbs, expert in the field of infectious diseases. 
 I'm not gonna shake your hand or... touch elbows or anything else. 
 Of course. 
 Tell me all about your patient. 
 Mr. Garcia presented with... 
 Abdominal pain, high fever, respiratory distress followed by cardiac arrest. You saw a rapid deterioration? 
 Absolutely, yes. 
 Worst-case scenario? 
 Sure. 
 Keeping in mind that coronaviruses are highly mutable and adaptable, and supposing that this particular one not only spreads through airborne transmission, but that the index patient is what we call a super-spreader, up to 20% of the hospital is dead within the next 12 to 24 hours. 
 I'm not trying to scare you. 
 (sighs) God, no. 
 It all depends on how well the virus adapts. 
 If it hijacks the immune system, and a cytokine storm occurs? 
 Well, then all bets are off. 
 I'd keep that to yourself. 
 Um, we're mentioning nothing about a virus, as of yet. 
 That's unwise. 
 We're just being cautious. 
 Dr. Reid could take you up to the I.C.U. 
 Of course. Uh, follow me. 
 Sure. 
 (Alex speaks indistinctly) 
 Has anyone been in to see Charlie? 
 No one. 
 Not even Jackson? 
 Not even Jackson. 
 Okay, until we figure out what this thing is, nobody goes through this door. 
 Of course. 
 (sighs) I don't care if his brain gets zapped for a week. 
 The T.M.S. won't hurt him. A virus will. 
 Wait a second. 
 I know this car. 
 Yeah, it's my parents. 
 What is going on? What the hell kind of virus is this, anyway? 
 They don't know. 
 I am living in total chaos. This is just a gong show. 
 I have 17 canceled surgeries, all of whom are screaming bloody murder, a cholecystectomy with abdominal pain, a septoplasty with profound sinus inflammation, and an acute pheochromocytoma with a migraine. 
 Oh, and could you check on Carol for me, too, please? 
 Where are you going? 
 Broken femur. Needs a traction splint. 
 You have to help me. 
 Uh, this is what residents do, Lin. 
 "Lin"? What is it with you today? 
 Woman : Here's more. 
 Great. 
 
 
 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Carol. Your luck has officially changed. 
 Your surgery went extremely well. 
 Oh. That is good news. 
 Yep, your wound looks great, um, your vitals are stable, and, uh, how do your legs feel? 
 Good. 
 Can you wiggle your toes for me? 
 Excellent. 
 Tell you what else... an hour later, and the surgery wouldn't have happened. How lucky is that? 
 Why not? 
 Hmm? 
 Why wouldn't the surgery have happened an hour later? 
 There's just this virus. 
 But, uh... you... you weren't exposed, um, at least, not directly... 
 So, uh, so it's unlikely that... you're gonna be just fine here, okay? Nothing to worry about. 
 I'll see you in a bit. 
 (inhales sharply) 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 We don't know yet, but I'm not taking any chances. 
 (woman coughing) 
 Well, we're tracking everyone who came into contact with the index patient, cancelling surgeries... 
 Ooh. I had a kick-ass distal pancreatectomy that got turfed. 
 (coughs) 
 Huh? 
 (thud) 
 I gotta go, mom. 
 Whoa. Stay back, stay back. 
 Hey, you might want to keep your distance. 
 She could be contagious. Dr. Pratt. 
 I'm gonna get you on your side, all right? 
 (beep) 
 (reycraft) Okay. 
 (man over P.A.) code blue, main floor. 
 You'll be all right. 
 (sighs) What do you want? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, I paged to the O.R., So what do you need? I'm busy. 
 I was paged here, too. Everything's on hold. 
 What's going on? Did you page me? 
 Hibbs : I did. I paged all three of you. 
 Bryan : Dr. Pratt is showing symptoms. 
 High fever, respiratory distress, and a new wrinkle... seizures. 
 We've moved her to the I.C.U. 
 The intubation... it was a difficult airway. 
 Was the patient coughing? 
 Yes. 
 And we were the other three people in the room. 
 Hibbs : Correct. 
 You're all under quarantine. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (buttons click) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, if I can... 
 (click, beep) 
 (amplified voice) Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have your attention, please... we are going into a temporary lockdown situation. 
 There will be no entry or exit for now. 
 The reason is that we have identified a virus within the hospital. Uh, let me emphasize... there's no reason to be alarmed. We're just being cautious. This is standard procedure. Thank you very much. (receiver clicks, beep) Zach. Anyone who came into contact with Garcia goes into isolation. That means you. (sighs) Victor : "Shortness of breath," check. "Sore throat"... check. "Myalgia and other nonspecific symptoms," check and check. You have nonspecific symptoms? Normal. Do me. What if this is it? What if we're about to die? We're not. We could. Shut up. Nobody is going to die. Okay? Just 'cause we were in the same room doesn't mean we're actually gonna get the infection. Normal. See? Normal. No, I can't die right now. I've got way too many regrets. You don't want to know the last thing I said to Shahir. Yeah, you're probably right about that. Alex : You know, Victor, you need to stop. You don't even have any symptoms, okay? (beeps) Uh, actually... Alex and Victor : What? "Actually," what? Uh, "99.7." you have a fever. (indistinct conversations, siren wailing in distance) Sir, there's no entry. Oh, I work here. I'm Dr. Shahir Hamza. Okay? Sorry. Look, I need to get inside. I'm the chief of neurosurgery. My friend... my boyfriend is sick. I have to see him. There's no entry, sir. Step back, please. (whispers) 16, 120. 24, 750. Carol? You just had surgery. That's why you feel lousy. That's all it is, okay? This is a low-risk area, and you weren't exposed to the virus. (whispers) 82, 87, 2606... Carol? (panting) (whispers) One, one, one. (kisses) Two, two, two, two, two. (kisses) Three, three, three, three, three. (kisses) Four, four, four, four. (kisses) You know, when aunt Liz told me you died in the accident... I didn't picture it like this. I don't know what I imagined. You know, here's the thing. Usually, dead people talk to me. Okay? I mean, I can't even get 'em to shut up half the time. Why aren't you talking to me? Talk to me! What is this? Why don't you stretch out, kiddo? Try and sleep, okay? (whispers) Six, eight, ten... It's called the law of contagion. It's a form of magical thinking, typical of various anxiety disorders. She associates that necklace with a positive time or event in her life, and so, in her mind, that specialness clings to the necklace. Sorry. Dr. Lin, Mr. Poladian is in a foul mood. Says he's been waiting almost an hour for you to see him. I'm on it. I'm on it. (cell phone vibrating) Phone's ringing. Who is it? (sighs) It's the ward nurse. Okay. (mutters) Um... Maggie. I can handle this. No, you can't. You're run off your feet. You're exhausted. Are any of your patients critical? Most of them are canceled surgeries. So that means they're just cranky and frightened. All right? Best thing at this point? Honestly? Double dose of lorazepam. For me? For them. Let's just dose the whole ward. (beep) (Kinney over P.A.) Your attention, please. If I could have your attention... in accordance with public health regulations, Hope Zion is now under quarantine. I repeat, this hospital is now under quarantine. All patients and staff must remain where they are. All movement is fully restricted. Do not leave your room. Do not approach or touch another person. These measures are  purely precautionary. We have no reason to believe that anyone is at risk, and we are working to end the lockdown as quickly as possible. In the meantime, thank you for your patience (hangs up receiver) Hey. Let's get back in the room. It took that plane guy less than 24 hours to die. Don't do that. Victor. Look, you can't touch me. O-okay. Okay, fine. I know. Joel : Victor's showing symptoms. He's diaphoretic. Reycraft : What's his temp? Just over 100. (lowered voice) Look, I'm not worried about him yet. You know, he just... If he spikes over 103, we need to get him up to I.C.U. (filtered voice) Okay, what about you two? Any symptoms? No, nothing yet. We're good. Good. Keep it that way, all right? I need to talk to Shahir. I need to see him. We had a big fight. You will, or I can call him for you, okay? But you're gonna be fine. You're young and healthy. The plane guy was young. And he could have had 15 things wrong with him. Look, we don't know why he died. I'm going into the O.R. Stay here, please. Victor, this is ridiculous. Actually, you know what? It's not such a bad idea. (door opens) It's gonna be fine, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it is. (siren wailing in distance) Have you been taking your temperature? Victor : Yeah, about every two minutes. "101.3." It's going up. Yeah, it could just be a flu, and it's not necessarily lethal. We don't know that yet. That hasn't been determined, Victor. It could kill dozens of people in there... hundreds, even. You always know exactly what to say, huh? Charlie's defenses are down. If he catches this, just... (sighs) Don't. He's gonna be okay. What about Maggie? Where is she? I don't know. You don't know? I've... kind of been a little occupied. No... Sorry, that sounded really cruel. No, I have not, uh, called Maggie. What? What are you looking at me like that for? You've been cheating on her. Why would you assume that? Because I know you, Joel. That's why you haven't called her. You feel guilty, so you're avoiding her. Okay, wow, this is, like, blindsiding... You know what? You don't need to try to make it better for me. You are unbelievable. You did this all through med school, even before we dated. It's your pattern. You take something really beautiful, and you screw it up. Okay. It's none of your business. You're right. It is none of my business. It's Maggie's business, and I feel sorry for her. Truth is, I don't really even feel that bad. (monitor beeping steadily) What if I'm wrong? What if it isn't post-op? She could have the virus. She doesn't. You don't know that, though. We could all have it. Mm, hey. Can I tell you something? Mm-hmm. You remember that time that I kissed you? Yeah. I shouldn't have done that. I take it back. Okay? I'm sorry for the way I've been treating you. I've been sort of dick-ish. No, you haven't. No, I have. I have. I know I have. My behavior has just been... bad. Hey. It's 2: 00 A.M. Get some sleep. We could share it. All right. I never imagined my last supper would be wrapped in plastic. At this point, I'm just happy I can still chew. (alarm buzzing) Woman : Got a code. (sighs) Grab the cart. I'll start compressions. (beep) (man) Code blue, I.C.U. Code blue, I.C.U. (Melanda) He's unconscious in P.E.A. arrest. The antibiotics and antivirals aren't working. His O2 sats are under 80. End tidal CO2 is rising. We need to clear the airway. Push epi and atropine. (pants) (beep) Paddles. (beeps, monitor emitting continuous tone) What? That was way too fast. 200. Clear. (paddles thunk) (beeps) We're going to 300. Jackson : You got it. (defibrillator whines) Clear. (paddles thunk) (beeps) (alarm buzzing) (alarm stops buzzing) It's not like Maggie and I are married Or anything, or even in a... in a serious relationship. Are you kidding me? Excuses. Are you listening to yourself? You can't commit to anything or anyone. Including you. Yes, including me. We were living together, and that still wasn't enough for you to make an actual commitment. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You were the one that walked out on me. Because you cheated on me. You wanted out, and you didn't have the guts, so I walked. Great, so you dodged a bullet. No, I didn't, Joel. You broke my heart. Anytime that something gets serious with you, you run away. You live your life in fear. You think that you're this... this big, fearless cowboy, but the truth is... the truth is that you will never take a risk... ever. Hey! (grunts) (cell phone vibrates) (cell phone vibrates) Melanda. Melanda : Dr. Wilson just died. Respiratory failure. And Dr. Pratt is critical. What about Charlie? Charlie's fine. No fever. Is he still being zapped? Yeah, and I'm not going near him to turn it off. Are you and Joel okay? We're fine. What about Victor? (coughing) Alex. He's coughing. You need to send a team down now. I will. Don't go near him. Where are you going? It's Victor. (coughing and wheezing) All right. Get you on your side. Joel : Al. Get him some oxygen. I'm on my way. Victor, you're gonna... you're okay. Attaboy. Give me a sec. Hold his head. Okay. Just breathe. That's it, buddy. Take it easy. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. We're gonna be okay. That's it, bud. This can't be a memory. I wasn't here. There's no room. John, there's no room. Hold on. Slow down. You're not gonna make it! John! (car horn honks, tires screech, crash) (pants) (alarm buzzing) It's Pratt. Move it. Let's go. (monitor beeps, emitting continuous tone) She's coding. (beeps) (clicks) I have run two levels of molecular tests and consulted at some length with the W.H.O., re: the Mumbai cluster. And... The incubation period has been confirmed at 12 hours. Which means that... I've prepared a short report with a timeline... Just the bullet points, please. (sighs) The virus is not airborne. It's transmitted through large droplets only... no secondary transmission. Garcia, the index patient, infected Dr. Wilson, Dr. Pratt, and Victor Reis, and while a number of others were exposed, due to the unpredictable and capricious nature of any virus, they escaped infection. So we're in the clear? Yes. Dr. Kinney, you can open the doors. For a minute there, you sounded disappointed. No, of course not. I'm thrilled. Although, I did think this might have been the one. It had so much potential. God. Look at that. (scoffs) (woman speaks indistinctly) (beep) Okay. Remember, in the extremely unlikely event that you develop any symptoms, either a shortness of breath or fever, you must return to the hospital immediately for treatment. Thank you. Excuse me. You'll be fine. You're doing great, Carol. Everything's on track. Thanks to you. No, it's all part of your post-op recovery. I have a request. It might seem a little weird. I wonder if I might have something of yours... something personal. Hey. A lock of your hair, maybe. (sighs) I know that must sound strange. Tell you what... I'm gonna give you something better. This is Dr. Murphy. Keep him close, and you'll feel better, guaranteed. Hi, Carol. Dr. Murphy. I don't think we actually officially met. No. I was hoping, uh, to talk to you a little bit about your numbers. Dr. Lin had mentioned that you have a ritual with your counting. Yes, I do. The special numbers... I have to say them in the right order. Um, is there any specific significance that you have to these numbers? Are they somebody's birthday or an address or something? (monitor beeping steadily) (thermometer beeping) (thermometer stops beeping) (sighs) Okay, fever's coming down. You can thank your immune system. What I said before... I know. I didn't mean it. (sighs) I love you, Victor. (whispers) Well... (normal voice) it's about time. I'm gonna go first. Can I go first? Um, yeah, of c... you can. This is gonna sound mean, and I don't mean it to. Okay. I'm just gonna say it. You're a terrible boyfriend. It's true. Yeah. I mean, really, really terrible... incredibly bad... (laughs) And I can do so much better than you. You're absolutely right. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry, too. (Patrick Watson's "lighthouse" playing) God, this is so sad. Okay. ♪ leave ♪
