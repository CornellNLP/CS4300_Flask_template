 Ladies, open your hearts to your suitor, Darius Beck! 
 Quinn : Shh. Network president. 
 Gary : He's black. 
 He's football black. 
 What about this scandal? 
 He called that reporter a bitch. 
 Bitch, please. 
 Chet? But what the hell are you doing here? 
 I'm taking my kingdom back. 
 If I keep following you around like this, the crew's gonna have a really hard time believing I'm the showrunner. 
 I just got to steer us past this train wreck, and then I will hand the show back to you. 
 Who's in charge here? 
 I am. 
 I am. 
 My two bosses, they're making two different versions of the show. 
 I can't produce it with them on the set. 
 Rachel wanted me to let her run the show all by herself. 
 That's why Coleman's here. 
 Coleman : You don't need Quinn. 
 Between you and me, we can make shows that actually mean something. 
 So you're the one who's calling me "Hot Rachel." 
 Well, you do kind of look like her. 
 Tell me what the judge said about the custody. 
 Give me a little good news. 
 You look amazing. 
 Can we talk for a second? 
 Absolutely. 
 You lied about everything. 
 Goodbye, Brandi. We're done. 
 Darius, it's Rachel. 
 Darius : Yeah. Come in. 
 You okay? 
 Shut the door. 
 All right, has anybody seen my messenger? 
 Dan : Nothing yet, boss. 
 Great, can you please just let me know the second it arrives? 
 I need it, like, yesterday. 
 Copy that. 
 Rachel. 
 Yeah. 
 Did you see these things? 
 Chet ordered them when he was still in charge. 
 What are those things? 
 Hello? Powder-puff football date. 
 It's supposed to be the girls' uniforms, but it's definitely gonna look like a p0rn shoot, and there's a reporter from  Entertainment Weekly  on set today. 
 Okay. 
 What, seriously? 
 So, it's just me then? 
 Your feminist sensibilities aren't offended by these things? 
 No. Not today. 
 Who are you? 
 What would Hillary say, Rachel? 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 [Car door opens] 
 Can't believe you're still driving that thing. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Why not? 
 What, you want to take it for a spin? 
 I'm still waiting to open her up, see how fast she goes. 
 What, do you actually want to watch Quinn turn into Naomi Campbell, because she's seriously gonna beat the crap out of me. 
 Don't worry about Quinn. 
 You've outgrown her. 
 Note taken. 
 Entertainment Weekly's  here, by the way. 
 Nice. All right. 
 I'm gonna go pull some clips for them. 
 Meet me inside in five? 
 Three. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Hammer pounding] 
 Dan, can you please let me know when the messenger arrives? 
 Dan : Copy that, boss.

 [Knock on door] 
 Go away. 
 [Muffled] 
 I brought you Raisin Bran without any raisins in it and... 
 What? 
 I brought you Raisin Bran without the raisins and Lucky Charms without the charms. 
 Oh, I didn't ask for that. 
 Um, I-I just thought maybe you would need it or want it. Um... 
 I'm sorry, are you trying to say something? 
 Then just speak. 
 [Nervously] 
 Well, you weren't answering your phone, so they started calling the production office and said about y-your dad. 
 [Sighs] 
 Christ. I'll deal with him later. 
 He's dead. 
 Your dad. 
 [Somber music plays] 
 Just get out. 
 Get out! 
 [Door opens] 
 [Mid-tempo music plays] 
 [Music ends] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Why... Why is there a baby here? 
 It's bring your baby to work day. 
 I'm sorry, did you, like, kill Cynthia or something? 
 [Chuckling] 
 No, I didn't kill my ex-wife. 
 I didn't kill her. 
 She's at a Deepak Chopra retreat. 
 I gave the nanny the day off. 
 It was time for some skin-to-skin pheromonal bonding time. 
 I thought that there was this whole, like, legal custody... 
 [Chuckling] 
 No. 
 Battle thing, which you lost. 
 Legal schmegal. No, this is my DNA. 
 This is my legacy on Earth, okay? 
 I'd like to see some judge try and take that away from me. 
 It's not gonna happen. 
 You'd have to pull my teeth and melt my bones. 
 Okay, can you please just keep the baby away from the girls? 
 It's like lady catnip. 
 [Women chattering, baby crying] 
 Madison, what are you doing? 
 [Voice breaking] 
 Quinn's always gonna remember me as the girl who went down on her fiancé and told her that her dad was dead. 
 Quinn's dad died? 
 Yeah. 
 I think she was just starting to like me. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 She wasn't, Madison. 
 ♪♪ 
 Quinn. 
 Hey, just, um... 
 I just wanted to come by and say that I'm sorry that your... that your dad died. 
 Oh, that's what you're sorry about? 
 Not Gary? 
 Okay, so, now's not the time. 
 Oh, it's the perfect time. 
 I mean, actually, the perfect time would've been before you went to the network, but now will have to do. 
 [Door closes] 
 I had a conversation with Gary. 
 Go on. 
 It's just that you gave me the showrunner job and essentially took it away. 
 So you stabbed me in the back? 
 No, I went to talk to Gary, somebody who could be objective, somebody that could be reasonable and cool headed. 
 Stabbed me in the back. 
 Okay, no, I just... 
 No, I was just trying to do what's best for the show. 
 Now, that's bullshit. 
 It was a power grab. 
 At least have the balls to own it. 
 [Scoffs] 
 No, it wasn't. 
 I was just freaked out because our show was going down. 
 Okay, well, your little freakout is the reason why that pre-teen dirt bag is driving around a sports car with the name of my show on it. 
 They would've never sent him in if you didn't tattletale to the principal. 
 And now we're stuck with him. 
 So, just go away, okay? 
 You have a new boss. 
 Stop acting like you care about me. 
 [Truck beeping in distance] 
 I do care. 
 You have a funny way of showing it. 
 You know, I plucked you from nothing, made you a producer. 
 And now you think you can just do this all on your own. 
 Well, you can't. 
 'Cause the truth is, you need me behind you, guiding you, pushing you, propping you up so you don't crack. 
 But you'll always crack, Rachel. 
 You're unstable and ungrateful, and you cannot make this show without me. 
 Dan : Rachel, your delivery's here. 
 Watch me. 
 [Door closes] 
 I'll have you come right here. 
 [Groans] 
 Took you long enough. 
 You know what, can you just freeze right there? 
 All right, there you go. 
 You don't have much time, so... 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 Good to see you, doc. 
 Good to see you, too, buddy. 
 [Sighs] 
 What the hell is she doing here? 
 [Door closes] 
 She knows. It's cool. 
 It's not cool. 
 One word about his injury gets out to the press, and his career's over. 
 Okay. 
 What the hell were you thinking, D? 
 How else was the doc gonna get in without her? 
 ♪♪ 
 Today on "Everlasting," it is powder-puff football. 
 The ladies will hit the turf in their pinks versus blues, and Darius is suiting up to play quarterback on both sides, but the stakes are high because the winning team gets that winning date with our prince. 
 Cue the ladies. 
 [Giggles] 
 Go this way, ladies. 
 [Women giggling] 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Right? 
 I mean, where's our romantic helicopter ride around a volcano? 
 And besides, we're kind of in our underwear again. 
 Works out fine when you look like me. 
 Rachel, where the hell is Darius? 
 I've got a field full of horny straight girls here and Graham is the only dick in sight. 
 It is not a good situation. 
 No one is having fun, Rachel. Where is he? 
 Yeah, he'll be there as soon as he can. 
 It's bad. 
 You put this off, and it's gotten worse. 
 Well, can you just, like, give him something for the pain for right now? 
 He needs the pain to tell him when he's done damage to himself. 
 [Darius groans] 
 It's time, D. You need surgery. 
 No, we talked about this. 
 That surgery has an 18-month recovery time and no guarantee it'll actually work. 
 My career could be over, and you know it. 
 D, you don't get the surgery, and your career is definitely over. 
 You can't play like this, and we can't hide it anymore. 
 Were you guys hiding this from me the whole time? 
 Is that what just... 
 I mean, you knew about it. That's why you're here. 
 It has nothing to do with "Bitch, please," right? 
 Look, I could've played my way out of that nonsense if I wasn't injured, but as it is, I still need to clean up my image and... and lock down that sportscasting deal. 
 That is right, yes. 
 That is why you need to stay here. 
 One wrong hit... hell, one wrong tango step, and that disc could fissure and paralyze him. 
 Darius : All right, doc, that's not gonna happen, okay? 
 I'm not even playing, so that's not gonna happen. 
 There's no... 
 You're not you're not hearing me, D. 
 [Groans] 
 Easy, easy, easy. 
 If it was my call, I'd duct tape you to a gurney and haul you out of here in an ambulance right now. 
 [Door opens] 
 See? 
 This show has enough footage to make you look good. 
 We spin it so you tweaked your back saving some girl from drowning, that you have to leave to do some physical therapy. 
 He doesn't know what he's talking about, okay? 
 We don't even have close to enough footage. 
 You have gone on a couple of dates and kissed, like, two girls. 
 Rachel, he's leaving. This show is not worth... 
 Do you know that there's a reporter on set? 
 Do you? 
 And if this reporter even thinks that there is a problem... 
 She's got a point. 
 Stop. 
 Fine. 
 You've got the day, but we're out of here tonight. 
 ♪♪ 
 No, that's stupid. I'm not doing it. 
 I want Darius off the field... 
 Mnh-mnh... doing a play-by-play with Tiffany. 
 Why? What is the point of casting a pro football player if we're never gonna actually watch him play football, Rachel? 
 Tiffany is your wifey. You should be happy. 
 This is gonna give her an opportunity to shine. 
 How do you not see that? 
 That's so sweet of you. 
 I'm not an idiot. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Just do it. 
 Fine.

 Good. 
 Oh, this is some bullshit.

 At least they keep giving us drinks.

 Number four? Okay. 
 Yep. 
 This is gonna be fun. 
 Is it? 
 Yeah.

 Hey, so, we really want to get everyone out there. 
 You know, having a good time. 
 So, no one else has a problem with this? Just me?

 You need to loosen up a little.

 Well, that's good. 
 Well, no, the doctor's saying that he needs to have surgery, like, yesterday.

 Do you have anyone that we could call? 
 Just discretely bring in here for a second opinion. 
 I do.

 What the hell is that? 
 Hmm? Oh, that's my progeny. 
 This is the future of the Wilton line. 
 Want to hold him? 
 That caterwauling ball of flesh is the result of you cheating on me with your wife. 
 It came out of her v*g1n*. 
 So no, I don't want to hold it. 
 Really puts things in perspective. 
 You know, the whole circle of life thing.

 Yeah, it's true. 
 Yeah, you raise kids, teach them everything you know, and then they grow up to stab you in the back.

 Good talk. 
 You okay? 
 I'm developing, Chet, okay? 
 Can't you tell by all my colorful Post-it notes? 
 So, you're giving up. 
 You know, when I wanted the show back, you fought me tooth and nail, but now that it's a little weirdo and dick for brains, you're just gonna hand it over to them? 
 This show is our baby. 
 We got to fight for it. 
 Hey, Quinn, did you know that Rachel... 
 Oh, my God, ew, is that a real baby? 
 What do you need, Jay? 
 Rachel and Coleman are acting real shady. 
 They've got Darius standing on the sidelines wearing a full suit looking like a black Pee-Wee Herman. 
 How's he gonna play in a suit? 
 Oh, that's my point. 
 Rachel's got him commentating. 
 How am I supposed to turn that snore-a-thon into a TV show?

 That's... That's big news. 
 Could affect his career. 
 [Tape whirring] 
 We show that he's hurt, and that's our story. 
 We medevac him in a helicopter, girls crying, sirens blaring, catfighting over who gets to ride with him to the hospital. 
 Just your general ratings-spiking, promo-making television gold. 
 And if the show tanks, it did happen on Coleman's watch. 
 Exactly. Coleman's out. 
 They come back to me as the genius who's made the show for the last 14 seasons, and then we just pick a new suitor. 
 Yeah, square jaw, Midwestern type. 
 And we're back on the air. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What do we have to do to make this happen? 
 We get Darius on the field, and we take him down. 
 Change of plans, folks. 
 A quarterback of Darius' caliber needs to be able to switch up a play just like that at the very last second, and that is exactly what he has done here today. 
 See, Darius needs a wider view of his lineups, both in the booth calling today's football game alongside pro football princess Tiffany James. 
 Yeah, she's a pro all right. 
 Princess my foot. I actually have tiaras. 
 The girls are on their own. 
 First team to score, remember, gets the coveted dinner date with our prince. 
 Go get 'em, ladies. Good luck. 
 The other girls are gonna hate me. 
 These other girls? These other girls already hate you. 
 You're blonde and rich. Who cares about them? 
 This is about you and Darius sitting side by side. 
 You know what he's gonna know about you?
