 Rachel : Jeremy and I have really started talking about leaving the business and getting out. 
 Really? 
 Don't go running off with Jeremy because he's the only person who asked. 
 Run away with me. 
 I know, Rach, about Adam. 
 How many times are you gonna make me look like a fool in front of these people? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Don't do it. 
 That's, uh... That's Hot Rachel. 
 So, this is the party truck, huh? 
 You found it. 
 Why don't you give me a tour? 
 This season, our suitor is more well-known. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Ladies, are you ready? Darius Beck! 
 Jay : Oh, my God. You like him. 
 I went on a paleolithic lifestyle retreat. 
 And, uh, this show is my kingdom. 
 Quinn : "Everlasting" was my idea. 
 Who's in charge here? 
 I am. 
 I am. 
 My two bosses are at each other's throats. 
 Gary : Coleman Wasserman. 
 He is the one in charge now. 
 You gave me the showrunner job and essentially took it away. 
 So you stabbed me in the back. 
 Between you and me, we can make shows that actually mean something. 
 You're the love of my life. 
 I have a baby now. I'm responsible now. 
 Man : You're under arrest for kidnapping and child endangerment. 
 [Engine revs] 
 Okay, what part about, "Let me out before we get here" did you have a hard time understanding? 
 What? You don't want to drive to work with the boss in his new, totally unearned, utterly gauche, and offensive British sports car? 
 No, I didn't. 
 Hey, come on. 
 We run the mother ship of this network. 
 I'm saying you got to own it. 
 Stake your flag. 
 Don't do this again.

 Riding to work with the boss. 
 Only four episodes deep. 
 Oh, Rach, I think you got a little bit of Quinn on your shoe. 
 Okay, I was running the show for Quinn. 
 I'm running it for Coleman. 
 Goldberg, you're sleeping with the showrunner. 
 Own it. 
 [Laughing] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Babe, did you actually shoot this with a gun? 
 This is hilarious. 
 You're sleeping with a contestant. 
 And you could get kicked off for this, by the way, young lady. 
 Right. 
 After you slept with the suitor all last season? 
 You did what? 
 What's behind your back? 
 Should I come take a look at it? 
 I think I should. Let me see it. 
 Hand it to me right now. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Ah. 
 Yep, right through my eye. That's nice. 
 Okay. Go. Hair and makeup. 
 Skedaddle. 
 See you later, sweetie. Go ahead. 
 ♪♪ 
 Quinn : This is wrong, okay? 
 I'm not a 19-year-old Instagram bimbo. 
 I am a boss. This is not what it... 
 My God. 
 You are a vision. 
 And you're back. 
 Who bailed you out? 
 Oh. Jeremy. 
 Oh. Well, he clearly knows where his bread is buttered. 
 How was jail? 
 [Zipper unzips] 
 Uh, it was hard, really hard. 
 A lot of drunks, losers... a lot of puke. 
 Those are your people, Chet, so get used to it. 
 Um, I just wanted to say... 
 What? You want to apologize? 
 Beg for my forgiveness? 
 Commit hari-kari on my rug? Go for it. 
 I-I wanted to say that... 
 That everything I said before the cops came... 
 That was... that was the truth. 
 Well, other than the whole "I stole my baby" thing? 
 Yeah. Other than that. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Take it off. 
 I meant it, Quinn. 
 [Zipper unzips] 
 You're the love of my life. 
 Chet, stop. 
 You're embarrassing yourself, okay? 
 If you haven't noticed, I'm busy. 
 I have the Impact Awards tonight, okay? 
 I'm gonna corner John Booth, and I'm going to produce him into letting me run one of his networks. 
 Quinn TV. 
 Please. John Booth. 
 Why is it that everybody who makes a billion dollars in some other industry thinks they can run ours? 
 He's a douche. 
 Well, he could be. 
 On the plus side, he's not you, Chet. 
 And, uh, that's the best thing about him. 
 Ugh. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Sighs] 
 Take it off. 
 [Door slams] 
 Come on, America. It's sexy time. 
 It is your chance to be a part of the action here on "Everlasting." 
 Now, tonight, Darius is gonna take things to the next level with one lucky lady who you get to choose. 
 Of course, we'll be tabulating your votes as they come in throughout the show. 
 Call, text, tweet, Snapchat, if you will, your votes for the first overnight date of the season. 
 And remember... America, it's time for your voice to be heard. 
 Oh, that's garbage. 
 Jay, what is that crap? 
 I mean, come on. I wanted Perrier-Jouet or above. 
 This is... And that's a cut. 
 [Bell rings] 
 [Door opens] 
 Mm. 
 I didn't think you'd be in here. 
 I kind of like this bunking together. 
 If you want me to find somewhere else to work... 
 What is that? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 What is this? Not nothing. 
 Holy sh1t, Rachel. 
 Where did you find this? 
 I found that in the camera truck. 
 In the camera... Jeremy? 
 That's a fire-able offense right there. 
 You can't fire him because he's good, and he's very fast. 
 Did you guys have a thing toge... 
 I'm not judging you, but this is cr... I mean... 
 [Sighs] 
 On a happier note, you're gonna need a ball gown, and we're leaving work at 6:00 tonight. 
 The Impact Awards. That's Quinn's thing. 
 It's  our  thing. Tickets go to the showrunner. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 I can't. It feels weird. 
 More like great and overdue, right? 
 Do you know who else is gonna be there? 
 Who? 
 The rest of television, everyone we're ever gonna want to work with in our careers. 
 It's a great opportunity, Rach. 
 Let's take it. 
 ♪♪ 
 Welcome back to "Everlasting." 
 We're at the midway point of the season, only seven ladies left. 
 But we have narrowed it down to your two fan favorites. 
 Now, of course, Darius will share a drink with each and then choose one with whom he will spend the night. 
 We have tallied your millions of votes, America, and the winners are... 
 Yael and Dominique. 
 Oh! 
 [Laughing] 
 [Both laughing] 
 Dominique : This is so good! 
 [Laughs] 
 Yael : Thank you. 
 Oh, wow. Ah! 
 [Sighs] 
 Where are these people? 
 What do you want, Rachel? 
 You're trying to sell Yael and Dominique as the fan favorites? 
 Well, yeah, anything's possible since we don't actually tally those votes. 
 I mean, I don't even really know where that phone number goes. 
 Okay, but, like, why Dominique? 
 So Hot Rachel gets the overnight. 
 I mean, if I gave Darius an actual choice, then I wouldn't get what I want. 
 Okay, well, Darius wants Ruby, FYI. 
 Of course he does. Madison! 
 Why are we doing overnights before the final two? 
 Uh, because I felt that the show needed a little more spice... unless you and Coleman have a different idea. 
 Maybe you want to give me some notes? 
 [Door opens] 
 Where's my stylist? 
 I don't know. 
 And where are the Impact tickets? 
 I don't have them. 
 Well, go get them. 
 I can't. 
 Madison... 
 No, actually, she can't. 
 [Scoffs] 
 And why is that? 
 Because I have them. 
 See, they're for the showrunner, and Coleman's the showrunner, so... 
 ♪♪ 
 Get out. 
 Quinn Out! 
 [Door closes] 
 Yeah, that's perfect. That's good. 
 Hey, Jeremy, you got a second? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's up? 
 Guys, could you give us a minute? 
 Man : Yeah, you bet. 
 Um, so, I got some feedback from the network about our look this year, and they have some concerns. 
 Really? 
 Well, what did they say? 
 Well, they used words like "flat," "undynamic," "not evolving." 
 What does that even mean? 
 Did they mention specific episodes or scenes or anything? 
 No, nothing specific. More of a global discussion. 
 Anyway, I'm gonna bring on a visual consultant to kind of course-correct the department. 
 A visual consultant. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That sounds... That sounds a lot like a new D.P. 
 Am I getting fired? 
 Absolutely not. 
 In the meantime, though, for a little while at least, I'm gonna have you move to the insert unit. 
 The... 
 [Chuckles] 
 I started on the insert unit. 
 Rachel put you up to this? 
 My relationship with Rachel is none of your business. 
 Well, maybe I should quit. 
 Yeah, well, you always have that option, don't you? 
 ♪♪ 
 Hey. 
 You look great. 
 Hi. 
 Um, are you sure about this dress? 
 It's not too revealing? 
 I don't think so. 
 I mean, this is the first overnight. 
 It's a really big deal, and... your competition... 
 Uh, yeah, that's kind of what I'm talking about. 
 I don't want Darius to think I'm trying too hard. 
 Okay, well, you better try something. 
 What are you talking about? 
 They voted for me. 
 Right. 
 Yeah, well, tonight's about Darius, and, honestly, the guy hasn't noticed you. 
 What? I'm a basketball player. 
 I'm a foot taller than everyone. 
 For better or for worse, Yael made herself known, so if you really want to stick around... 
 What should I do? 
 ♪♪ 
 America has done the difficult work and narrowed the field down to Yael and Dominique. 
 So, what do you say, Darius? 
 Thank you, America. 
 Now, obviously, the final decision is yours, of course, but to help you, we have asked Yael and Dominique to come up with their very own specialty drink to give you a little insight on what an evening with each one of these beauties might have in store. 
 It should be Ruby, and you know it, after last's week's, like, beautiful, Nubian lovefest that I captured. 
 Jay... 
 No. 
 You brought her here for the wrong reasons. 
 Rach, you thought she'd be gone in two episodes, but guess what? 
 What's happening between them is real, and that in itself is a beautiful story worth telling. 
 Okay. So maybe it'll be her. 
 How? 
 Will you stop? 
 Seriously, shut up. 
 Have some faith. 
 A splash of lime juice, just a kiss of orange blossom, three ounces of Cuervo. 
 There it is... 
 with raspberries and mint. 
 I mean, she really is s*x on a stick, isn't she? 
 Darius :  Not bad. 
 [  Chuckles ] 
 I call it an Uncharted Depth... 
 Uncharted Depth. 
 A drink which reveals itself over time. 
 I'm that way, too. 
 People often get the wrong impression 'cause of the way I look, but I never spend the night with someone unless I'm truly serious about them. 
 "America, welcome to my boobs." 
 - Dominique. 
 I don't have a fancy cocktail for you because I'm all about honesty, integrity, and knowing what you're gonna get. Ugh! In other words, a snoozefest in bed. She looks like a magician. Simple glass of red wine... and the truth. If you're gonna be spending the night with one of us, it should probably be the one who's not sleeping with the crew. [Tape rewinding] What? What? Wait. What did she just say? Um... Excuse me? Are you saying she... Darius. You deserve someone who's here just for you, Darius. I am here for him. You got a funny way of showing it. Don't listen to this. She lied to your face. Are you kidding me? She's been lying to you. Quit this. How do you get the nerve... [Door opens, closes] Jeremy, what are you doing? What, are you drunk? [Burps] Getting there. This prick demoted me, so I'm filing a formal complaint. I'm not sure that's the protocol. I'm not going back to insert unit, Chet. I'm not starting over. It's been five years. I think I have a way to help us both. Really? Did you talk to the network or talk to him or... No, no. No more shortcuts. Follow me. ♪♪ Darius : I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed. Yael, I was really looking forward to getting a chance to know you a little better tonight. But considering what I've just learned... I'm pretty sure my heart wouldn't be in it. Can I just say, in my defense... I'm afraid Darius' decision is final, Yael. Dominique, I'm sorry, but it's not going to be you, either. While I value monogamy and trust, I'm a big fan of discretion and fair play, and you showed neither of those today. Who the hell is Hot Rachel sleeping with? That said, it would be a shame to let the dream suite go to waste. I hope America won't mind if I pick a wild card. I hate it when they go rogue. Okay. Okay, there you go. Yeah. Yeah. Stop there. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Don't pick her. Ruby... No. Unh-unh. Do you have plans this evening? No! No, no, no. Okay, this is not happening. Madison, go get Rachel. Bring her here right now. Go. No, Madison, don't worry about Rachel. Hey, uh, could you guys... Could you guys step outside for one sec? Everyone, Madison. [Scoffs] [  Theme music playing ] [Door opens] Thank you. Can you put these ladies to bed? Bitch, please. In my sleep. [Chuckles] I'm going to a gala. Have fun, Cinderella. A Darius/Ruby overnight? I mean, please tell me that you're the dumb-dumb who made that happen. That was all Rachel. [Scoffs] It was a good idea, too. Yeah, okay. Look, I get that you're upset. Why don't you go home? Just take a couple of days, like a week. You've suffered a loss. If you had met my father, you wouldn't call it a loss. I'm not talking about your father. She outgrew you. [Scoffs] It happens. You had to know it eventually would. You know what? You can just get out of my control room. You're pulling all of this crap just to mess with Rachel. Be bigger than that. Trust me. You're gonna get your show back at the end of the season. I don't plan on putting down roots here. So, you got big plans, do you, for you and your little Chia Pet? You know, tell me... If you want to get rid of me so bad, why don't you just call the network and have them remove me? Is it because you don't have enough juice or you don't have the balls to do that? You know, you're awfully obsessed with my balls. You should probably look into that. Featuring Ruby again after last week's ratings, which were crap... Right. Oh, unless you don't know how to read those e-mails, you know, the ones with all the numbers on them and stuff. 10 years from now, maybe 5, no one's even gonna know what a broadcast network is. They won't. We'll be watching everything online. So the only thing that matters is, can you make some noise? You've been doing the same thing you've done for 14 seasons. It's just... It's not noisy anymore. I'm sorry, Quinn. Have a good night. [Door opens] Madison! Find me Wagerstein. I want Ruby's files in my hands 10 seconds go. Go! [Chuckles] Oh... I can make some noise. Okay, that's perfect. So, this is as far as we're gonna go. So, I'll come get you in the morning. We'll do a champagne brunch and a quick little debrief. Sound good? Mm-hmm. All right, cool. So you want to give us a kiss before we shut the door? [Chuckles] Oh, my God, that is so beautiful! [Chuckles] Ruby. [Whispering] Win this bitch. You got this. Okay. Okay? ♪♪ [Chuckles] Okay, no pressure. Hey, just get me a quick shot of this, and then we're done, okay? We don't have to do anything. Mm-hmm. Okay? [Smooches] But I am going to open that. Yes, please. - Please do that. [  Chuckles ] Wait. Hang on. Just in case. Oh, you think you're so smart. But guess who's smarter? Boom! [Chuckles] Look, I want to make sure we're off the grid. [ Chuckles ] I'm sorry. Um... [Chuckles] Weird sh1t, right? Uh-huh. [Chuckles] Fine. Forget romance. If Ruby could do anything she wanted for once and nobody was watching, what would it be? Hmm. What? Whoo! [Laughs] Okay. Look, girl, they're gonna think we're having wild, crazy s*x in here. Oh! Do you really care? Come on. [Chuckles] Just come jump with me. Jump. Wait. Ah. Um... I would rather just watch you. [Singsong voice] Okay. Your loss. Whoo! Ooh! I know. I know. Wait. What the hell, Quinn? How do you even have audio in the suitor's room? Oh, I, uh... I put up four new cameras, and they seem to be working pretty damn well. Jay : Yeah, but this is the overnight. You're breaking the rules. Actually, those are my rules. I made them, so I can break them anytime I want. What are you trying to do? Capture this love story. Right? It's gold, Jay. You did some really nice work, so why waste it? 'Cause we can never use any of this. Well, I mean, our first black couple falling in love, making "Everlasting" history? I don't know, Quinn. You know, I... I mean, I promised Ruby. You know, she thinks no one's watching. You know, you didn't seem to have a problem last week. And now it seems like she might go all the way, and you're suddenly feeling skittish? No. That was different. Oh, okay. You know, fine. You can turn the cameras off if you want. But, you know, don't blame me when you're still wrangling anorexic bimbos because nobody got to see your best work. ♪♪

Well, I've got a question for you. Is Beth Ann going all the way? 'Cause I'd like nothing more than to see Little Miss Sweet Home Alabama bring home a black suitor. I'm "Everlasting's" biggest fan. This should really be a... a sweat lodge. That's the way we did it at my retreat. What are you trying to do here, Chet? Get to the truth. About what? [Sighs] Sit down.

It was my fault, and I got to... I got to take responsibility for what I did. [Sighs] Especially with Quinn. [Exhales sharply] God, that's intense. Okay. [Clears throat] Uh... I got demoted today.

Get them out of here. You go ahead. Tell your daughter what you want her to hear. ♪♪ You've worked so hard... MENSA at 16, Phi Beta Kappa for this? None of that's changed. It's all changed. Whenever someone Googles you now, the first thing that'll come up is this show. Daddy, I came on this show to have a wider platform for what we're trying to say. Then how did you end up here? I fell in love. Oh, my God. Love after four weeks on a reality show? What the hell's gotten into you? He's a pro football player, Ruby. I make $40 million a year. Dad, you don't even know him. I know all I need to know. Bitch, please. Dad, you're making a fool of yourself. No, he is! To be where he is, in his position, and not doing more for his people. Dr. Carter... Please, can we just talk? Once you leave here, sweetheart, you'll see how you were deluded, all right? Come on. I'm taking you home. No, you're not. I'm sorry, Dad, but I'm staying here. I'm so ashamed of you. [Crying] [Sniffles] [Sobbing] [  Sobbing ] [Sighs] Wow. Hell of a show. You don't mess around. Sometimes you just get lucky. Mm. I don't believe that for a second. I think you're just like me. We make our own luck. Now, I always thought this was scripted or made up. Oh, we don't make it up. We make it happen. Well, to the master of disaster. Ah. Hmm. [Chuckles] Uh, Jay, Madison, wake the girls up. We're having an elimination ceremony. Quinn, it's almost midnight. I don't care how late it is. And if I see one droopy eye or saggy tit, someone's getting fired. Why don't you go outside and meet the girls while I get this thing ready? Can I meet Beth Ann? Sure. She might even say the "N" word for you. [Chuckles] The set's right around the corner. Rachel : What the hell is wrong with you? You sent in her father? Yeah, and you sent in the camera after him. But can you just admit that this has nothing to do with the show? This is all about you being upset that you weren't invited to the party, and so you're taking it out on Ruby. Oh, don't kid yourself, Rachel. I am always invited to the party. The only reason why you went is because you're banging the boss. Well, I learned from the best. You think Coleman's your ticket out of here? Please. You could run circles around that snot-nosed little brat. You're just too scared to. [Chuckles] You know something? I am not scared. For the first time in my life, I actually have a partner. Wha... He's not your partner. He's your Chet, okay? He's gonna steal all of your ideas and take the credit. Nope. Coleman is not Chet. Yes, he is, but you're not me. You're not gonna survive it, okay? You're gonna be right back to sleeping in your car and snorting cold medicine for breakfast. Okay, let me paint you a very different picture. In three years, I will have my own show and a man that loves me. Okay, I am just trying to protect you, Rachel. From what, the beautiful life that you never had? No, thanks. He's a user. Just... be careful, okay? ♪♪ [Door slams] ♪ Darius : Hey. I am so sorry about my father. Hey, not the first time a girl's dad walked in on me. Well, first time since high school maybe. [Scoffs] [Chuckles] [Grunts] I know he's your dad, okay, but... He can be an ass. Mnh. Not quite the word I was gonna use, but... The things he said... He was just surprised and angry and... Yeah, but he wasn't wrong, not about all of it. This might sound crazy to you, but I know that I was put on this earth to make a difference, to be heard, and... And not to fall for a dumb-ass football player. But you're more than that. I don't know, Ruby. Yeah, but you said... Well, don't you want to be? You can do more. You could speak up. I could teach you. You can be everything my father says that you're not. You know that, right? Yeah. I know that. [Sighs] [Sighs] ♪♪ Ladies, obviously it's, uh... It's been a very long night. But for one of you, it is about to end. If your candle is extinguished, it is time to say goodbye. [Voice breaking] Darius, before you say anything... I need to apologize for the dirty, disgusting mistakes I've made. "Mistakes." You hear that? That's plural. I did something beneath me. Yael, stop. I'm not here to judge anybody. Um... actually, yes, you... You are here to judge us. We are all human. We all make mistakes. The best we can do is learn from them. You're safe tonight, Yael. [Exhales sharply] [Scoffs] Oh, my... Dominique. Seriously? Me? All I did was to tell you the truth. So that you could bring somebody else down. Come on! Is this a joke? You can't do this. You know, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I can and can't do. [Candle holder shatters] Rachel : Camera A, follow her. Wow. Tough night, huh? I'm not done. I got one more. He's going off book, ladies. Darius is calling an audible. Jay : No. No. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Ruby, but your dad was right. You've got a lot of important work ahead of you. Please don't do this. Look. Whoever it is you think I could be... you should go be with that guy. No. Darius, that's not what I meant. Okay. Maybe I could do more. I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying I don't feel like I'm enough for you or your dad. ♪♪ And I don't like how that feels. Darius, please. It's gonna be too much work disappointing you every day, Ruby. [Inhales sharply] I can't believe I trusted you. Jay, I did everything I could. Graham : Ladies, uh, that concludes our elimination ceremony this evening. Good night. [Crying] Well, did you, uh, see everything you needed to see? Not quite. Oh. ♪♪ [Chuckles] You, uh... You want to come home with me? Uh, which home? Don't you have three or four? Six. No, seven. You can choose. I would, but I have this thing tomorrow. Well, that sounds incredibly vague. [Sighs] My dad died. Funeral's tomorrow. I still need a coffin. Costco's open late. [Chuckles] Not many people know this, but Costco sells coffins. They have a full mortuary services department. And how would you know that? Well, that's a billionaire becomes a billionaire. Uh, then to Costco it is. [Chuckles] [Car door opens, closes] [Engine starts] [Vehicle departing] [Door closes] Do you want to talk about... About Ruby? What's to talk about? I mean, I feel like... Hmm. The footage is probably gonna be amazing. That's just how we make the show. You know, we're just, like, following the stories. Yeah. I guess I'm just a little surprised you let Quinn get between us. She's not. She's not between us. Good. Look, it's been a long night. I think I'm just gonna head home right now. Sounds great. I'm gonna... Yeah, I'm gonna return my dress. You looked really beautiful tonight. Thank you. Good night, Wasserman. See you, "Vassar." [Car door opens] [Engine starts] [Tires squeal] [Beer can pops] [Door opens] [Slurred] You're working overtime. No, I'm just, uh... I'm just changing my clothes. We got to talk, Rach. I really don't feel like talking right now. Why did you send your douche bag little lackey of a boyfriend to demote me? I, like, honestly don't even know what you're talking about. Bullshit. Dude, you're drunk, and you're being an ass right now. I'm being an ass? Well, I guess we're the perfect pair, then, because you're a selfish, manipulative little bitch. No. No. Jeremy, you... No. No. You want to demote me? You demote me to my face. You want to fire me, you fire me to my face. [Groans] Money, dick, power, right? Right? You know what you need? You don't need a boyfriend. You don't need a boyfriend, Rachel. What you need is a zoo keeper 'cause you're a wild animal who if is let go... I am a wild... [Dramatic music plays] That's not what a man does. Chet : I tried to help you. You're fired. [Exhales sharply] You okay? Yeah. I just have to change my clothes. Okay. ♪♪
