 CHET: She's the female Elon Musk. 
 Serena is our girl! 
 Do I or do I not look like a stripper mermaid? 
 I brought my own dress. 
 I'll wear that. 
 I'm Crystal. 
 I am a student of Chet's. 
 I'm so super impressed by what you do.

 RACHEL: Who's this guy? 
 QUINN: He is our new shrink. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Okay. 
 Stop. 
 Come on. 
 I just told you to kiss the guy. 
 This is the last watch of the night. 
 Billy. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 What the hell? 
 Now, how did that happen, Rachel? 
 So, how's she doing? 
 She got really drunk on the first night,  made out with a guy, and then cut him. 
 Not the Suitress... 
 Quinn. 
 I don't think she's got it anymore.

 How's our girl Serena this morning? 
 I've been getting war-texts from Gary since 5:30 AM. 
 Are you serious? 
 Why? 
 The ratings were good. 
 Not good enough. 
 Yeah, we're still squarely on the bubble. 
 I promised him tits-out sexy,  and we delivered our hottie Suitress  - in a nun's frock kissing Mini Me. 
 - Okay, fine. 
 Fine! 
 So the story wasn't exactly what we wanted, but still... 
 But if she hadn't cut Norman,  then maybe the people would've come back to see  if the jockey would ride her, but instead we have... 
 Hey, why are you ignoring me? 
 What is that face? 
 [WHISPERS] 
 The jockey did ride her. 
 What?! 
 That is fantastic! 
 No.

 - Serena? 
 Yeah? 
 Hi. 
 Just doing a deep dive on the guys. 
 Trying to keep all their BIOS straight before I go out there. 
 This is her in a good place? 
 You got pictures on all the guys? 
 Yeah, I used one of those cheat sheets the PAs have. 
 Found it in the garbage. 
 Oh, I-I'm sorry. 
 You picked through the garbage? 
 I know, it's very classy, but I had to have a system  so I can remember who everybody is. 
 And you have, uh, last names and professions on everyone. 
 That's impressive. 
 Yes, well, I ask a lot of questions. 
 Where did you get those Post-its? 
 The control room. 
 What? 
 No, no. 
 No, Serena, the control room is a no-fly zone. 
 Dorothy doesn't get to peek behind the curtain here. 
 Well, I did. 
 So buy a lock. 
 Or fire whoever was supposed to be guarding it. 
 I was up at 4:00, there was no one in there. 
 Oh, I saw your security cameras on the guys, by the way. 
 Saw the security cameras, Rachel. 
 Oh! 
 Cowboy snores big time. 
 Okay, so, Serena, we really just want you to relax into this  and let things happen naturally. 
 That leaves way too much up to chance. 
 I don't want to cut the wrong guy,  so I need to individuate the contenders. 
 Yeah, you wouldn't want to have the wrong guy slip through your crack. 
 It's how I buy companies,  so doing this any other way  - would be irresponsible. 
 - I get it. 
 - I just... 
 - Jasper, Jasper, Jasper, Jasper. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - Jasper is my guy. 
 HBS. 
 All right, listen, Serena, I know that things got,  you know, things got a little wild last night. 
 You're just trying to get everything under control... 
 This has nothing to do with control or last night. 
 And how about you never talk to me about that again. 
 Can I get some space, you guys, to prepare, please? 
 Okay? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Uh, um. 
 You know, we actually set up a poker game for you tonight. 
 Just go out there and just show the guys how impressive you are. 
 Well, I am gonna kill this. 
 Poker game? 
 Oh, that will be sexy. 
 Okay, she's on something, right? 
 Listen, she's just nervous, all right? 
 She's really, really nervous. 
 Well, then you need to get her hooked up to a tequila I.V., all right? 
 I need her lubed up and user friendly. 
 I want to be worried about a gang-bang at least 10 times today. 
 10 times, really? 
 Quinn, that feels like a lot. 
 Hey, Quinn, uh, I was wondering if... 
 It is not a lot, trust me. 
 I am having a conversation! 
 Ah, it's great to see you, too.

 In front of you is $500 worth of chips.

 SERENA: Here we go, boys. 
 I will warn you, I am very good at poker. 
 - Really? 
 - Really? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - I'm scared, I guess. 
 We'll do 200. 
 Oh-ho-ho, big spender? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - She's doing great. 
 I don't know, she looks kind of road worn in HD. 
 - What is she, like 32? 
 - Shut up, Madison! 
 32? 
 That's depressing. 
 Can't we say she's like 29? 
 No, we can't say that. 
 Well... 
 Because it's not true. 
 Well, say she's divorced. 
 At least at some point somebody wanted her. 
 I'm gonna ignore that you just said that. 
 We're just gonna tell the truth. 
 People are gonna relate to it, okay? 
 So, tell me Serena, how did you, uh, get so good at poker? 
 Well, I got so good at poker because Mark Zuckerberg has a game. 
 You and the Zuckerberg? 
 Do you think he really is the, uh... 
 the genius that they say he is? 
 Oh. 
 I'd say he was definitely the, uh,  the second smartest person in the room. 
 - Hm. 
 - Well, now she's just bragging. 
 She is what my friends and I call an "Old Sad."  And what what is that, exactly? 
 Somebody who made the biggest mistake ever  and chose her job over a boyfriend. 
 Right, and now she's a mogul. 
 Wah. 
 MADISON: Ha-ha, okay, fine. 
 But who says being a baller makes girls happy? 
 If all you do is put all of your life  and energy into your job and your career  and that's all you focus on,  - then you're just gonna end up like...

 - Whoo! 
 - Oh, my God. 
 Congratulations. 
 So... 
 you won? 
 Cut! 
 Well, that was a great idea for a date, Rachel. 
 She turned into a condescending dickhead! 
 What's wrong with her winning? 
 - It's cool. 
 - She can hang with the guys. 
 Yeah, except none of the guys want to hang with her.

 - Okay, well, that's ridiculous. 
 - What is? 
 - W... 
 Hi. 
 Listen, we think it's great  that you are super smart, you're successful,  you can do everything by yourself,  but what guy wants that? 
 - A lot of guys. 
 - Lots of guys. 
 - A lot of guys. 
 - Look, it's great that  you go to the office and you kick ass. 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 And girl power and all that. 
 Look who I hire. 
 Hire? 
 Wow. 
 But the woman you are at work  is not the girl that a man wants to date. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 - RACHEL: Okay. 
 So, I'm sorry,  and what do you want her to do? 
 You want her to just, like, go on a date  and magically turn into somebody else? 
 I mean, I-I go on a lot of dates all the time. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 First dates. 
 - Yeah. 
 - What about second dates? 
 Thought so. 
 Look, I might not be the brightest guy in the world,  but I did create one of the most successful shows on TV... 
 because I know what guys want and I'm not afraid to say it. 
 Now, would you like me to tell you  why you don't get those second dates? 
 Oh, this is gonna be good. 
 I'm willing to hear your theory. 
 Women make it so complicated. 
 All you have to do to keep a guy forever  is bake him cookies and give him blow jobs. 
 - Oh, my... 
 - That's a bunch of crap. 
 I'm speaking metaphorically, of course. 
 RACHEL: I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 You got to make space for the guy. 
 And you've got to make him feel important. 
 Maddy, come here. 
 Show her what I'm talking about. 
 - Oh, sure, she knows. 
 - Okay, look. 
 So, if you're going on a first date with a guy,  there are only three things you need to put on repeat. 
 - You are so right. 
 - Yeah. 
 This is a great idea. 
 Can you, um, can you help me? 
 - Stop talking. 
 - Yes. 
 - No, no, no, keep... 
 keep going. 
 - What? 
 You're not seriously listening to this. 
 I-I am just taking a pitch. 
 Okay. 
 Serena, yes, Chet can get you a guy, sure,  but he can't get you the guy that you want in the way that you want it. 
 Yeah, but can you? 
 If I go scuba diving, I hire a scuba diving instructor,  so maybe if I'm messing up with the guys,  I should talk to a guy. 
 - Serena... 
 - I'm not gonna drop to my knees   
 - or bake cookies any time soon. 
 - Come on! 
 Seri... 
 No, I'm... 
 I will  give your strategy a try,  and then I will objectively evaluate it.

 it is the Chet Wilton Center for Reality Television Studies. 
 - Mm. 
 Talk about higher learning. 
 - Yeah. 
 He's put me in charge of this fundraising dinner,  and I have never done anything like this before. 
 Chet told me you were amazing at handling his business  when you guys were together,  so I thought maybe you could make this,  like, really amazing, too. 
 That's a pretty big ask, Crystal. 
 I don't think I can jump that high. 
 I-It's just so important that Chet finally  gets the recognition he deserves. 
 I mean, after all, he is the visionary that changed,  like, the "grammar" of network television. 
 I mean, it was his idea for characters to talk directly to camera. 
 Hmm. 
 Is that... 
 Is that what he's teaching you? 
 But it's not just about his career,  it's about his whole personal story with his father. 
 I mean, it's incredible that he's had so much success  when he had such a tough start as a kid. 
 Chet's father left when he was 6. 
 So what? 
 There's a lot of kids  that have been raised by one parent. 
 But Chet's father didn't just leave. 
 I mean, he took his own life. 
 I mean, the way that Chet found him  in the garage with the car still running... 
 Most people don't get past something like that. 
 But Chet isn't most people.

 You know, I... 
 I, um... 
 I got to get back to work. 
 - Okay? 
 - Okay. 
 Uh, so will you help?

 I will, uh...

 I want a one-on-one with Billy. 
 He's really into me. 
 Yes, because you are acting like a bimbo. 
 Thanks, but I already have a bitter best friend.
