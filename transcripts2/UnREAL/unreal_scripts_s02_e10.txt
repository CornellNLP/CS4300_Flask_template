 I just wanted to... Making the final two. 
 Darius, if you really can't play anymore, then you have to marry Tiffany. 
 Well, you got Romeo shot. 
 If you even... 
 You put our suitor in the hospital. 
 The truth incriminates Rachel. 
 She's the one who called the cops. 
 I'm a reporter. That woman Mary, who jumped off the roof last year, that was a murder. 
 Who's your source? 
 Jeremy. 
 This piece will be unstoppable. 
 I need you to walk us through it. 
 We lied, we covered it up. 
 Police should've known when Darius... 
 'Cause we killed her. 
 Take the medicine, sweetheart. 
 I found a place. We'll work things out with a therapist who isn't your mother, then we are going to burn this place down. 
 I saw Coleman sneaking out of Yael's room this morning. 
 Hot version of you is stealing your little boyfriend. 
 You need something that you can build an episode on. 
 Who's your target? 
 Yael. 
 Go away! Oh, my God! 
 Why would you...? 
 Quinn, what is it? 
 You want kids, and I can't have them. 
 I won't be anybody's disappointment. 
 I have work to do. 
 Quinn? 
 Are you really going to let me walk away? 
 Yes. 
 Coleman knows about Mary. He's about to expose us. 
 I am so sorry, Quinn. 
 We really have to stop them. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Hey, babe, what's up? 
 Hey. 
 Um... 
 Hands off the keyboard, please. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? 
 My guys have been instructed to confiscate every piece of electronic equipment in this office and to ferret out any backups or cloud-based versions you might have already uploaded. 
 Rachel, why are you doing this? 
 Uh, I don't know. Maybe because I don't want to get carted off to some beautiful institution while you take down "Everlasting." 
 I know. I know that that's what you think is best for me, but I actually know what's best for me. 
 Which is this. 
 This is crazy, Rachel. 
 See, that's where you're wrong again, Coleman. 
 Um, I'm not crazy. 
 In fact, I'm smart enough to call your ex-girlfriend, who told me that she didn't break up with you because you moved to Hollywood. 
 No, she actually broke up with you when she found that you paid off some downtrodden Asian extras to impersonate the Cambodian s*x slaves in your award-winning documentary. 
 Shocking. 
 So it turns out that you're just as full of sh1t as we are. 
 Now what's going to happen is this... 
 You are going to keep your mouth shut about us, we will keep our mouths shut about you, and everyone will live happily ever after. 
 I win. 
 Again. 
 Move it.

 Tonight on "Everlasting," 
 Darius will make his final choice live on the air. 
 Okay, now step back, Graham. This isn't a fricking three-way. 
 Keep B cam on Tiffany. I want plenty of snarky eye rolls and that "I just smelled a fart" thing she does with her face. 
 That. Yes. Perfect. That's perfect. 
 You're back. 
 Indeed. What do you got, Jay? 
 Got flowers, we've got dresses, I've got blinding diamond rings. 
 Actually, I don't have a horse-drawn carriage because, apparently, the Clydesdales dinged the driveway last season, but... 
 Locations was mad. 
 Okay, whatever. 
 Everything else is a romance explosion. 
 Mmm, that's great. 
 But people want a shit-show, literally. 
 If last week's ratings were any indication, none of this love-dovey boondoggle. 
 Whatever happened to selling true love? 
 Yeah, that's over. 
 I want to see a bitch bleed. Thank you. Let's go. 
 Let's see what we have today, shall we, Rachel? 
 As you can see, I don't just envision our lives to just be the two of us. 
 Vision boards, wow. 
 I did that when I was in the third grade. 
 We can be a beacon of light for all those around us. 
 "A beacon of light"? Who talks like that? 
 Just light the flame. 
 Thank you, Chantal. That was beautiful. 
 And, uh, last but not least, Tiffany, you're up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Darius, I mean, sure we could hang out at my family's ranch and ride horses. 
 Oh, you can hang out at your ranch. You're so rich. 
 ...is filled with a bit more adventure than that. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hey, uh, C camera, could you do a close-up on Tiffany's ankle, please. 
 Passion, excitement, desire. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Graham : Exciting. 
 Thank you, Tiffany. That, uh... 
 I'll have to... Sounds exciting. What are you even talking about? 
 So, uh, what? 
 America... 
 You're screwing her now? 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 How did you know that? 
 The anklet. 
 It's your move. Your only move, Chet. 
 You give one to every person you become infatuated with. 
 Hell, you even gave one to me when I was still a PA. 
 You remembered. 
 Is Quinn a little jealous? 
 Mm. 
 [Laughs] You wish. 
 Mm. 
 It's a taste issue, Chet. 
 It was tacky then, and it's tacky now. 
 [Scoffs] 
 So I'm supposed to get engaged tonight to one of these girls? 
 No, not one of these girls. To Tiffany. 
 Remember, we talked about this. 
 It's true, D. 
 She's got the dad, the connections. 
 That's the only reason I'm back here, to make sure this really happens. 
 You need to get your head in the game, my brother. 
 Exactly. And pretty soon, we're going to have to come clean about this injury. 
 So unless you plan on moving out to the boonies to like, run a used car dealership for the rest of your life, we need a decision. 
 Which I thought we'd already made, but regardless, we have to prep for a winner. 
 I like how you guys got all the answers. 
 What now? 
 [Door closes] 
 It's Tiffany. 
 Oh! Congratulations! 
 Mazel Tov. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 You know, I think, uh, Tiffany is going to be perfect, actually. 
 Why would... Wh-what did you say it like that for? 
 What's...? 
 You know, why don't you just get back out there, okay? 
 Because my diamond guy's setting up. 
 Just make sure that Tiffany picks the emerald cut, 'cause like it or not, that's what she's getting. 
 And you, why don't you go do something? 
 How about you, Wags? 
 What? 
 You're just going to sit there? 
 Oh, no. Uh, no, you know I never listen. 
 Yeah. Why don't you just make yourself busy? 
 I will. [Clears throat] 
 Now let the real work begin. You ready to do this? 
 Born ready. What do you got? 
 Well, I need you to produce Yael to get her ass back on camera. 
 No. 
 I need her for the finale. 
 That girl hates me. 
 I made her sh1t her pants on national television. 
 [Laughs] I know. It was fantastic. 
 But she's part of a much larger plan, okay? 
 Trust me. It's going to be epic. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 They're only letting you keep the car 'cause nobody else wanted it. 
 I can't believe you could even show your face to me. 
 You have balls. 
 Oh, my God, you're such a dick, dude. 
 Hot Rachel? I mean, seriously? 
 You just couldn't control yourself. 
 Oh, you had just revealed some fairly alarming details about your mother, about Mary, about who you really are. 
 I'd say the instinct to run away from all that's pretty human. 
 Oh. So I'm just too damaged to bring to your Puritan, stick-in-the-ass family wedding in Chilmark? 
 That's just not what my family is about. 
 And your family knows, right? 
 That your whole career is based on lies? 
 Do they? 
 I'm not going to let you touch this place. 
 Because this "Everlasting" is all you have left now. 
 That's sad. 
 And Quinn and all the other vagabond... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ...orphan misfits that work here, they are the only people who will ever accept you for the broken, damaged, vile person that you are. 
 All right, guys, you can take him away now, thank you. 
 I promise you this is not over. 
 Let's go. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 "Ring shopping"... two words which inspire butterflies in the bellies of women all over the world. 
 [Sighs] 
 Now, if Darius decides to take that next step with either one of you tonight on live TV, then one of these beautiful baubles could be yours. 
 Tiffany : Oh, my God! 
 Chantal : Oh, my God! 
 Hmm. Distract them with sparkles. 
 These are gorgeous! Oh, my gosh. 
 Look at this one! That is amazing. 
 Hey. You wanted me? 
 Yes. Uh, go get Tiffany for me. 
 Yeah, but they're doing the diamond... 
 Right now. 
 Yep. Okay. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hi. 
 What? 
 All right, look, I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now. 
 You poisoned me. 
 You humiliated me on national television, and you and Quinn just, what, laughed about it? 
 No. And I'm sorry, okay? 
 It was all my idea, and I know that it was wrong. 
 Uh, Quinn just wants to speak to you right over there. 
 Oh. Is... Okay. 
 Thank you. Yeah. 
 Hi. Hey, Quinn. 
 Hi. Uh, okay, here's the deal. 
 Technically, I'm not supposed to be telling you this, but... it's you. 
 Darius is picking you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God. 
 Ahh! That's amazing. 
 It is, isn't it? 
 And yet, there's more. 
 Um, not only is Darius going to propose to you, but he wants to marry you tonight on live television. 
 Oh, my God. That's unbelievable. 
 It is unbelievable, isn't it? 
 So you're going to need to get your family here right away. 
 Okay, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I'll call my dad right now. 
 He's going to be so stoked. 
 Oh, I bet. [Laughs] 
 Thank you. I cannot say that enough. 
 Oh, you can, actually. 
 And there's... There's one more thing. 
 I'm going to need you to dump Chet. 
 What are you... talking about? I'm not... 
 Uh, Tiffany? 
 That really can't be happening if you're going to marry Darius now, can it? 
 Nope. You're absolutely right. 
 Consider it done. 
 Oh, I do. 
 Hey, can we just be honest for one second? 
 Probably just a lot of, like, internalized misogyny, you know, like I hate you but I really hate myself. 
 I mean, I'm a feminist, and this is what I do. 
 No, do not try to Sarah Lawrence me. 
 I'm not an idiot. You're dangerous. 
 And from what Coleman tells me, you're actually crazy, which makes you even more dangerous. 
 Okay, so, um, can I at least try to make it up to you? 
 'Cause I could help you change the narrative if you wanted. 
 Quinn needs somebody to go on camera tonight to confront Tiffany about some hidden secret. 
 You could be the truth teller. 
 So you want me to go on television and shame another girl just to get the focus off of myself? 
 This is what's wrong with America, women constantly hurting other women. 
 Got it, Hillary, no problem. 
 I was just trying to tell you that all of that cameras would be focused on you, every eye in America. 
 You would be the star. 
 Isn't that really why you came here in the first place? 
 Just saying there's a lot more you can get out of this show, besides a husband. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 Quinn, I don't understand. 
 You told both the girls that they're going to win. 
 Of course I did. 
 And that Darius wants to marry them. 
 Ugh. Listen to me. 
 Last season, when Anna was triumphantly walking up the staircase and wearing that poof of a dress, I realized I could never see a finale any other way. 
 And what is better than one bride? 
 Two brides? 
 See? 
 But does Darius even know? 
 Uh, listen, numbnuts. 
 You want a seat at the grownup table or not? 
 So badly. 
 Then pay attention, okay? 
 The suitor fake-proposing to one of these bimbos might've been interesting 14 seasons ago, but now we have an obligation to our viewers. 
 We have to escalate the tension, up the stakes, complicate the story. 
 Two brides. 
 Right. 
 Darius is backed into a corner, he has to pick Tiffany, leaving Chantal humiliated, and all in that beautiful Vera Wang dress, making it that much more depressing. 
 Wait, but... But Chantal's my girl. 
 Ugh. Trust me, you don't want Tiffany, either. 
 Why not? 
 Because once Tiffany is safely ensconced as Mrs. Darius Beck, we bring back the storm of poop [laughs] that is Yael, and she reveals that Tiffany has secretly been sleeping with the executive producer. 
 What? Quinn! 
 It is blood on the floor, an abattoir ratings bonanza. 
 You're incredible. 
 Yes. I am. 
 Chantal does have a dying grandma. 
 I could absolutely get her here. 
 Oh, see, now we're talking. 
 Good job, go, go, go. 
 Now we both lose, you little idiot. 
 Neither of our girls win. 
 Actually, Darius will be marrying Tiffany, so that is a win. 
 Oh, just relax. I'll give you the bonus. 
 You two can split it. 
 [Scoffs] 
 So that's it, huh? This is just what we do at the end of every season now, just humiliate the suitor? 
 Now, that is a show that I would watch. 
 Can't you see how unfair this is to Darius, Quinn? 
 After everything we put him through, he deserves an ending. 
 This is an ending... just not a happy one, but it's about as real as it gets. 
 [Door opens] 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, my God, Chet? 
 Chet, what are you doing here? 
 That's not sexy at all. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh. 
 I just wanted to drop by and tell you that, you know, I get it. 
 You get it? 
 Wow. Okay. [Laughs] 
 Okay, well, that... that makes things really easy. 
 Did Quinn talk to you? 
 No, she didn't have to. 
 I know you got to play the game. 
 Hell, I created the game. 
 [Chuckles] All right, well, uh, thanks for being so understanding. 
 Do all the talk shows and get the covers of all the magazines, couple of beaucoup endorsements, make a lot of money, and then you break off the engagement. 
 Happens every year. 
 Um... 
 Uh, Chet, you know what? 
 Uh, I have to tell you something. 
 Um... 
 You know, Darius doesn't just want to get engaged tonight, he wants to get married. 
 And I'm going to say yes. 
 Even better. Yeah, you'll get an annulment. 
 This thing, we can draw it out forever. 
 I mean, that's... that's brilliant. 
 No. 
 No, Chet, I'm going to marry Darius tonight for real. 
 Believe it or not, I love him. 
 I re... I really am sorry, but, I mean, when you really think about it, it's... 
 It's not like we ever really started anything. 
 It was ridiculous. 
 It was really comforting. 
 Comforting? 
 Yeah. 
 But we have to end it. 
 I'm sorry, I... I... I have to finish getting ready, okay? 
 Yael's in. 
 [Laughs] See? You really can do anything. 
 Oh, my God, it was so easy. It was textbook narcissist. 
 You know, I don't really understand what he sees in her. 
 Ugh. What are you talking about? 
 He sees me, only younger, hotter, less damaged. 
 Exactly. Not you. 
 Guy's an idiot. 
 Now I'm the idiot. 
 I blew it. 
 Just like my mom said I would. 
 What do you mean, like your mom said? 
 Come on. 
 Coleman hacked your phone and tried to put me in jail, so how did you mess that up? 
 I just told him all this... this stuff. 
 You know, like stuff that... 
 That happened to me when I was a kid. 
 I... 
 Okay, life lesson right there. 
 Yeah. 
 Screw Coleman. 
 And screw your mom.

 We're getting closer to Darius' final choice, tonight, live. 
 Obviously, he has a very big decision to make, and we have some big surprises in store. 
 Oh, you have no idea what kind of surprises, Graham. 
 You're going to be excited. You might even get a hard-on. 
 But first, let's take a look back at Tiffany and Chantal's journeys,  two journeys which each began with one simple step. 
 Oh, this is going to be so exciting. 
 Cue the packages. 
 Tiffany : When are you going to get out the box and start using your damn legs? 
 Ugh. The fact that I have to watch this stuff again nauseates me. 
 So we got Chantal's grandma. 
 She's in a car, she's on her way. 
 Great. 
 She has no idea what's coming, does she? 
 Do you ever feel bad about what we do to these girls? 
 Darius : Oh, my God! 
 Darius, I'm so sorry! No. No, we don't. Okay. Hey, hey, eyes up here. She's a moron. That's a cut. Graham : That sucked. I... I... No, it was good. No, I'm not in the moment here, just hold on. No, it was great. We're going to move on. I need another take, I'm not feeling it. We're not doing another take. I saw images of, like, other sh1t. Darius? Hey, how you doing? Good, no thanks to you. Okay, uh, well, today is the last day, so I just wanted to come over and say that, um... I was sorry, you know, about the cops and Romeo. Should've never listened to you. When I pulled up in that limo, day one, I should've seen that do-gooder, white girl, crazy-eyed look and run right then. I would've really loved to have run with you. Now I'm supposed to feel sorry for you? No, no, no, no. I just wish that... You know what I wish? That I could still be playing football. Yeah, that I was actually proposing to a woman that I love, that I could have played the game and won. But I get it. Yeah, I get it, I get it. Nothing's real. It's all a facade. So I'll play that.

Yeah, uh, Coleman thought that, uh, maybe I could use some media training, you and I get our stories straight. When they let you out of here, I'm taking you and Jeremy, and my buddy at CNN, we're going to blow the lid off this thing tonight. This story coming from you two, I think, is going to be big. Us two?

Okay, so, so, Romeo got shot, she lost her mind, she called her mom, her mom put her in the hospital and on these drugs. She was out of her mind. So when I finally got her out of here, she thought that was a good time to tell me about some crazy childhood rape. At the hands of one of her mother's patients. I mean, with a mother like that, what do you expect? Hey, you dodged a bullet on that one, am I right? Uh, yeah. Um... Yeah, I didn't know about that.
