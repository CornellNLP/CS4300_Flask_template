 Get, get, get. Want a go at me, bro? Come on. 
 Come on. Stop pissing around. You being a dickhead? 
 Oi, come on. 
 Thank you, bus driver. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Where to next? Criterion? 
 No, it'll be shut. 
 That's bullshit. 
 Ludo :  It can't be shut this early. 
 Nick :  New owners. 
 Taki :  Well, let's go to yours, then, Nick-o. 
 Check it out. 
 (whistles) 
 Watch and learn, boys. 
 Oh, here we go. 
 Good book? 
 I love reading. 
 Yeah, it's true. He can read. A bit. 
 (laughs) 
 (book beeps) 
 Hey! 
 Can I have my book back? 
 Not until you talk to me. 
 Please. 
 Oh, has got a nice firm grip, this one. 
 (man laughs) 
 Nick :  You're tough for a little chick. 
 Show us the muscles. 
 Let me just have one little read of your book, please. 
 Oh, you can handle the four of us. Come on. 
 Love a strong woman. 
 (men laugh) Taki :  She's a Hairy. You shouldn't be outside the Zone, you filthy rug. (gasps) Stop the bus! Call the Containment Authority. Woman :  There's a Hairy on the bus! You're not going anywhere. There's a Hairy on the bus! Get her off! (grunts) Taki, you all right? Call the CA, quick! Woman :  Stay away from her. She's a Hairy. Ludo :  You won't get away with this, you freak. ("Take Me Home" playing) (man singing in native dialect) ♪ Take the head and the body will follow ♪

♪ Take the head and the body will follow ♪ 
♪ Take the head and the... ♪ 
♪ Take me home ♪ 
♪ Take me home. ♪ Man :  The shocking injury suffered by the young man, Ludo Abbiati, last night only reaffirms this government's commitment to keep these dangerous subhumans within the area known as the Zone. Minister, have there been any other reported incidences  of attacks on humans living within the Zone? None that I've heard of, no. Humans who live in the Zone must carry valid IDs  and are free to come and go from the Zone area as they wish. But Hairies who try and exit the Zone will be detained in other ways. The international community has accused us of violating human rights in our approach to the Hairy peoples,  but our priority is protecting the rights of humans who are threatened by these dangerous and unpredictable creatures. Security at the checkpoint will be increased. The wall will be strengthened. And penalties for anyone who smuggles Hairies out of the Zone are becoming both harsher and more strictly enforced. The reward for reported sightings of subhumans will be doubled. We must all help to make this city a safer place in which to live. (sirens wailing) You reckon they saw us? No, we're all right. Keep going. We should have guns. Since when do you know how to use a gun? I know how to hold one. (footsteps) Hello. It's all right. We're not gonna hurt you. (speaks native dialect) Oi, I told you we should have guns. Mr. Koen? Not mister, just Koen. (speaking native dialect) It's a little kid. I thought you'd have shaved down. You didn't give us much time to prepare. Hey, little one. Koen :  Blair, get the bags. Why do I have to get the bags? Get the bags. We need to hurry. Hey, you want to push the button? Go on. (beeps) (elevator beeps) (exhales) In here. There's a spare bulb under the sink. Oh! Whoa, sorry. People can be animals, eh? So you've got hot and cold running water. Security cameras so you can monitor who's coming and going. You got high-speed Internet. You know, you can order anything you want and you don't even have to leave home. You said three bedrooms. I said I'd see how it'd go. So we get the one-bedroom price? I'm giving you the one-bedroom price. (Araluen speaking native dialect) Listen, Bundy. Boondee. Boondee. Boondee. You told me you wanted to get out of the Zone, yeah? Now, I know this place isn't everything,  but it's almost everything. Put a bit of work in and this place will feel like home. I guarantee. And when something better becomes available,  I'll let you know, I promise. Nice doing business with you. Thank you. Araluen :  Jyra. Blair. (door opens) (door closes) (music playing) Your share, my brother. You didn't say there'd be kids. Probably older than me and you put together. Oh, that's all right, then. All I was told was I had five shavers wanting to bail out of the Zone. Maybe this time we should just let them be. They get three square meals a day, a roof over their heads, a nice warm cell. It's good for them, better. Man on phone :  Containment Authority. How may we help you? Hello. Yes, I'd like to report a sighting. Subhuman sighting? Koen :  Subhuman for sure.  A whole family of five. What is the location? Koen :  Apartment 34, Alberto Street, Windale. Do they pose an immediate physical threat? No, no immediate threat. And what is your ID number? 1688145. I have you up. Was there anything else?  Nah, that's it. Thank you for your call. Your reward is being processed now. Prepare retrieval process. Screw the embargo. We got a family this time. I'll handle the minister. Get Belinda reporting. Tell her I want a human angle. Irony always comes included, you know that. Man on radio :  The problem, as I'm sure you're all aware, is the Zone. (phone ringing)  If you want to get rid of the Hairy buggers, get rid of the Zone and people like Waruu West harboring Hairies. They're talking about you.  Back on the switchboard lighting up. Ah, I must've said something right for once. Belinda Frosche. Woman :  Hi, we have a CA team on. Really? How many?  A family of them. A family? What about the embargo?  We're being told to cover it. Great. Now what's the address? Apartment 34, Alberto Street. Get a camera team ready. I want to be first on the scene. Man on radio :  ...have recorded a spike in arrests,  arrests of subhumans across the city. Hey. Waruu, please. (TV shuts off) Okay.

Yeah, you said that yesterday, Uncle Waruu. You boys want to get out of here, you go to school. Not like me. Get an education. Get a job that'll pay you half decent money. Yeah, whatever. Tell me tomorrow, hotshot. Hello. Howdy. Hey. About time. Running low on supplies. No triple antigen or tetanus. Everything else on the list I managed to find. Hey. Anything else? Uh, well, yes, there is. Waruu :  That's yours, isn't it?  Love the mag wheels. Yeah, they're not mine. Someone's showing appreciation for the doc's work. Don't get gifts like that working in a fancy private hospital. I can't drive home like that. You boys, switch the doc's wheels back. No way. No, that's silver alloy.  Do it now. My work here is done. (laughs) Thanks. (tires squeal) This is the place. Set up over there. Hurry, here they come. Move! Go! Go! On really hot days, the sisters would roll around in the cool mud of the billabong. And ate berries? And ate so many berries that they had juice running down their cheeks and their tummies were ready to burst. (laughs) Come here.  (pounding on door) Man :  Containment Authority. We have permission to search these premises. (pounding) Open up. We will not ask twice. (pounding) Containment Authority. (speaking native dialect) We're going in. Down on the ground. On the ground. On the ground. On the ground now. Get down on the ground. Drop the knife and get down on the ground. (zip ties zipping) Djukara, do as the man says. Drop the knife! Search the rest of the place. (zip tie zips) Jyra, quick. (screams) Let me go! Let me go! Oi, clear. Araluen :  No! Jyra :  Mom! Let me go! Officer :  Separate the men from the women,  adults from the children. Make sure you get some shots of the crowd. No, no, no, Djukara. Get your hands off me. (crackles) (groans) Djukara! Get up, rug. Get him up. (speaking native dialect) Oi, no language! Get him in the van. Separate the girl. No, no, no. Jyra! No! No! (crackles) (groans) Mom! (grunts) Djukara, help me! (bone cracks) Pull them off. Mom. Djukara! Djukara. (shouts) (men shouting) (crackles) (groans) Get off him! (gunshot) (panting) Jyra. (radio chatter) Jyra! Boondee :  No! Jyra! Jyra! (speaks native dialect) Wake up. (crying) (speaking native dialect) Tell me you're getting this. (speaking native dialect) (all gasping) Come on, up you get. (wailing) (speaks native dialect) Please! (crying echoes) (phone buzzes) Give me a minute. No, just shut up and listen to me. Now, you know you are prohibited from broadcasting anything. This operation was highly classified. 80,000 years the Hairy people have been on this planet. They predate our oldest culture. Spare me the sanctimonious bullshit. You're about to run a snuff movie. You know what embargo means? I understand the headache it's gonna cause you, but the story happened and it makes great TV. And I run a TV network. A bit hard to run a network without a broadcasting license. Your party got elected on the promise of open and transparent government. And you want to knock our license out? Go for it. I want the raid story leading every bulletin. (dog barking) (TV playing)  (kissing) Waruu :  Hello. Hey. I'm trying to concentrate here. Your doctor seems to be working out. Community is starting to accept her. I didn't think she'd last. I'll tell her you said that. And I'll tell her you've got the hots for her. Only one woman I'm hot for. Waruu, better come see this. (electricity crackles) Araluen :  Djukara! Belinda :  Shots were fired and Tasers deployed by Containment Authority officers  while attempting to detain a subhuman group of four earlier this afternoon. Two officers were severely injured in the clash while a subhuman minor has been killed. Not a child. Father's name was Boondee. They've got nowhere to live, 'course they want to leave. And this is gonna keep on happening until... Yeah, I know that, but I can't just kick families out on the street to move Hairies in. I'm already copping grief from my people. I thought we were all your people. Belinda :  A tip-off was made to the Containment Authority's retrieval hotline number. Retrieval officers were then dispatched to the apartment block behind me. Trouble began when CA officers tried to separate family members. Mom! No! No! Jyra! Jyra! Belinda :  As we were first on the scene, we have exclusive footage of what happened. And a warning to those at home, some viewers may find the following distressing. You gonna finish those invoices or what? (Djukara shouting) Araluen :  Djukara! Officer :  Get off him! (electricity crackling) Officer :  No guns! Get off him! (gunshot) (gasps) Jyra. 
 
 Hey, you catch the news? Kid was a subbie. Did anyone see you? It's cool. They shot the kid. No one knows it was us. Hey, they shot the kid! She is dead because of us. Come on, Koen, this is all wrong. Okay, you want to give the cash back? Is that what you want? Want to give it all back? Close this place down? Go back to stacking supermarket shelves? I grew up in the Zone  and I'm making a future for myself. If you two want to walk away, there's the door. Excuse me. Yeah, whatever you say, brah. (music playing) (people chatting) Do I still have a TV network? I want a prime-time spot from you. On the "O'Grady Show." You've got it. And I want Waruu West with me. How does Tuesday sound? Geoff. Charlotte. I hope my husband isn't harassing you about something. Wonderful to see you again. Do you like the work? I think you might like this one. "Coffee"? Yeah, it's a political statement about skin color. Oh. Thing about coffee, it's always coffee. Drink it black, it's coffee. Add a splash of milk, it's coffee. Add a lot of milk, it still tastes like coffee. I'm a flat white kind of guy myself. Yeah, he said it. You look ravishing. (music playing) Help you, brah? Are we related? I need to speak to Koen. Koen. Uncle Jimmy, what are you doing here? Phew. What do you got in the bag? Something dead in there? Take it. Go on. Your father would want you to have this. Hey, it's not a toy. Sure, Jimmy, whatever. Give it to my big brother. You're a man now, son. You need to start acting like one. Now you look after that. Okay. This is not a game. Time you decided which tribe you belong to. I'm not planning on joining any tribe, Jimmy. I'll be watching. Thought none of them talked to you anymore. He really your uncle? (sighs) Dad's brother. What's this thing he gave you? Don't worry about it. Officer :  Separate the girl! Araluen :  No, no, no! (Jyra screams) Jyra! Mom! (train clacking) (people shouting) Hey, Jimmy. You walking a straight line there, brother? Hey, Harry, you Hairy b*st*rd. Got to see Waruu.  Bar that way. Waruu this way. Waruu :  All right, fellas, bring it in. Bring it in. Bring it in. Once the fight's done, the dispute's over. Agreed? Agreed? (cheering) We agree? Agreed? Hey, woman. Hey, who you calling woman? Be me and you in the ring next. (scoffs) Let's fight. (crowd cheering) I need to talk to you, mate. Later, Jimmy. After the fight, eh? I've done something really bad. What? Look, we'll talk later, Jimmy, yeah? Koen's gonna need your help, all right? You look after Koen. Sure. (crowd booing) Get up! Get up, skin. You're not done. Fight's done. Fight's over. (crowd booing) You're done, brother. (laughs) (cheering, booing) Waruu :  Easy, everyone. We're all brothers here. You all know that these fights are how we resolve our issues. Maliyan, this fight is over. I'll say it again, it's the Containment Authority, the government, they love it when we're divided, Hairy against human. Why? Because it weakens our position. Makes us easy pickings. That's why we have to stay united. That's why we have to stay together. Live by our own rules, yeah? Crowd : Yeah! (cheering) Has the money been transferred to the account of Mr. James West? Man :  It has, sir. Thank you. It's all sorted, Jimmy. Paid up front just as you like it. And everything's ready at the lab. I'll give you the spirit, but then I'm finished. I've had enough. Find yourself another Cleverman. (siren wailing) (exhales) (foghorn blows) (speaking native dialect) (music blaring) Tequila Sunrise. $15.50. Thanks. Not interested in her? About to run out of beer. I'll go. That'd be a first. (fire crackling) (rumbling) (speaking native dialect)  (native dialect continues) (growling) (laughing)  (footsteps, growling) (creature shrieking) (crunching) (breathing heavily) (moaning) Stay with me. Stay with me. (gasps) Koen! You all right? (groaning) Blair :  Oi, what the hell is going on? We got a full bar out there. Koen fainted. He just... he just crashed out. Hey. You all right? Come on. Come on. Got a bit of blood in your eye. You gonna be all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right. (phone rings) Nerida :  Hello? Yeah. Yes, it is Nerida West. What? Oh, no. Yeah, I understand. Sure, we'll... we'll be down. It's Uncle Jimmy. Only one thing I know does that. Eh, Uncle? Namorrodor. It took his heart. It's just stories. This is no story. It only turns up when things are out of balance. Who would hurt Uncle Jimmy? That's for the police to find out. You said they couldn't find their own asses with both their hands. (chuckles) At the fight, what did Uncle Jimmy say to you? Um, he just told me a story. You know, the one about the sun and the moon. The grandfather has to decide which of his two sons to pass... His knowledge. Yeah. And he chooses the sun and that makes the moon angry and that's why the moon only comes out sometimes because he's jealous of the sun. Did I get it wrong? No, you got it right. No way I'm the moon. (voices chatting) (woman whispers in native dialect) (whispers in native dialect) Ash :  That'll do. That'll be good. Blair :  I thought you'd like it. What did you say? We didn't say anything. We're doing portraits. Are you all right, brah? All good. (people coughing) (sighs) You're the one that was fighting them, eh? What's your name? Djukara. I'm Kulya. This is Mungo. And you're famous. My parents? They separate everyone. Men one place, women another, boys another, girls another. We haven't seen our parents for months. (door opens) Move! No talking. Officer :  Get out. Come on. Get out! Come on, move. All right, boys. Get 'em out.  (dogs barking) No jungle talk. (helicopter blades whirring) Hurry it up, monkeys. Bring 'em in. Move it! Left foot, right foot. Hurry up. Bend over, rug. Bend over! (grunts) So we always know where to find you. (sizzling) (screaming) Suck it up, princess. Next! Come on, monkeys, hurry up. Bring him in. Shut up. Down. A kiss from me to you. (screams) (sizzles) Harry :  I'm sick of saying it, Waruu. The Hairy people here in the Zone are living in third-world conditions. Kids have got nowhere to go, no running water. Spending every night in a shitty old train station is no way to live. At least here in the Zone they're safer than on the outside. Up behind your fancy block of apartments, maybe. But down here, it's a refugee camp for Hairies. CA still raid this place when they feel like it. You want them to stop calling the smugglers, you've got to offer up something better. Yo. Yo. (people coughing) (baby crying) Waruu. Gotcha. (door opens) (footsteps) Hello? Who's there? Girl. Girl! (train clacking) (birds cawing) Little brother. Long time. (scoffs) Brought your girlfriend around, I see. Waruu :  Aren't you gonna offer us a drink? Sorry, no service. We're closed. That's all right. I can help myself. Good bar. You like trading in other people's misery. What do you want? Leave. Now. Get the... get out of my bar. You're not welcome. (coughs) You made the call. You little rat. You Judas leech-sucking vermin of a half brother. Why should I care what happens to some subbies? He's the reason you should care. (grunting) (cracks) (screaming) Next time, I won't be able to save you. (Koen crying) f*ck. Ah! Somebody! Help! Blair! Ah! Give me a look. Let me have a look. No. Let me have a look. Blair, get something. He's bleeding. A freaking Hairy ripped my freaking finger off. Okay, let me see. Koen. (crying) All right, it might not have gone through, but you're gonna need stitches, okay? It's all right. Koen, your eye. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oi, oi, what the hell? What the hell? (groans) Nerida : Hey, did you tell Aunty Sal she has to move out of her flat to make way for Hairies? That's not what I told her. Yeah, it's the way she's taking it. And I'm the one that's copping it. Look, all I said was that we needed to get together to sort through the accommodation crisis. She's got the other aunties worried, too. Just explain to them what I'm trying to do. I'm Jarrod Slade. I'm very sorry for your loss. Your uncle was a fine man. Sorry for your loss. Thank you. Thanks for coming, you mob. We all know Jimmy's been off the rails of late. But he was at heart a good man. Took me under his wing from a young age. Brought me up to know right from wrong. Jimmy always went out of his way for people. Hairy, human... didn't matter. For Jimmy, the Zone was his home and all of you were his family. A true... (speaks native dialect) Our Cleverman. He more than anyone understood the value of community. He would have died before he let anything happen to you mob. That's what his life's work was all about. And I hope as his next in line to do the same. (woman whispers in native dialect) (woman speaks native dialect)
