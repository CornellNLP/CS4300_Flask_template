 (shouts echoing) 
 Dickson :  How many are there, rug? What am I up against, huh? 
 (man groans) 
 (clattering) Hey, hey, wait. I know the code for the door. Waruu :  Leave it. Come on, brother. Let us out. Come on. (screeching, wings flapping) (thumping, screeching continues) Djukara :  2258#. 2258#. (beeping) (lock unbolts) We can't take them. Yes, we can. Nerida :  Come on, bub. Let me in, eh? Don't lock me out. Djukara :  Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad, are you in there? What's your friend's name? Djukara. Forget him. We have to leave now. Take these fellas and get out of here. (alarms blaring) (groans) How many are there, rug? What am I up against, huh? (panting) "Take Me Home" playing (man singing in native dialect) ♪ Take the head and the body will follow ♪ 
♪ Take the head and the... ♪ 
♪ Take the head and the body will follow ♪ 
♪ Take the head and the... ♪ 
♪ Take me home ♪ 
♪ Take me home. ♪ Keep everything secure and wait for further instruction. Man :  Yes, sir. Copy that. How many escaped? Three. I've cleared the area of personnel. Keep them waiting. (police radio chatter) McIntyre. Yeah. I'm not concerned. This is good for us. I got my hands full at the moment. I'll call you back in 10. (distant men shouting) (squelching) (breathing heavily) (computer beeping) Need to see some ID. I come through here every day. No ID, no entry. This is bull crap. (scanner beeping) He's all right, mate. (computer beeping) I got him, I got him, I got him. (groaning, gasping) (groaning) I got him. Need some help here! (Djukara gasping) Charlotte : Put him up on the bed. Okay, take your hands off. Take 'em off. (Charlotte groans) Oh, okay. I need some more compresses. He's lost a lot of blood. Yeah, he's going to need to go to a hospital. No, we have to fix him here. No, we can't. They're the same as us. They've got a totally different physiology. Now, I've only treated some for cuts. Waruu :  Well, that's more than most. Boys, keep quiet. Charlotte :  I'm a GP. He needs a surgeon. What do you want me to do? Call the emergency ward? We contact the authorities, he's as good as dead. Eve, put your hands here. How long has he been unconscious for? He's been in and out. He's been shot. (phone buzzing) Okay, he's going to need a blood transfusion. I need blood. He can have mine. Well, what if it's not the same type? Well, I'll guess we'll find out. Eve, I need you to run a tap. Yep. Hold this, Waruu. Hold it. Nice and tight. Get in! Damn you. Okay, your turn, big guy. Take off the coat. Prep him, Eve. Prep him. (men shouting) How'd they find this place? It's supposed to be a clandestine operation. Animals. (shouting continues) Get the media in. I want this image beamed across every screen in the country. Blair :  So, can we keep her? Ash :  Not funny, Blair. She can't stay here. Stop, okay? Enough! Why'd you call me? I did what you asked. I broke you out of that weird sh1t lab. You know, why can't I hear you now? Talk to me. I need to know what's going on. (sighs) Just tell me who you are! Whoa! sh1t. Koen! Koen! Blair :  What did you... what did you just do? You crazy bitch. What did you do to him? Blair : Hey, hey, hey, hey. Ash :  Koen. Hey. Hey. Koen? Hey. Stay there. Koen. Bruz? Hey, Bruz. Koen! Hey! Koen. Koen! I want those three escapees back in custody by the 6:00 news. (chattering) (police radio chatter) (radio chirps) Halt! You! Halt! Man : Suspect subhuman in quadrant six. Give us an image. Facial recognition. He's a free-ranger. Geoff :  A what? He's not one of your breakout boys. (people shouting) (panting) We lost him. Not good enough. Damn it. (snorts) (gasps) (boys laughing) Do you think that's funny? (Blair laughs) b*st*rd! Ash! (smoke alarm beeping) What? Nothing. Bruz? What just happened to you? You touched her and, boom, you're out cold, like you got hit by electricity or something. Did you see something when you touched her? Nah, nothing. Oi, Ash, don't. It's too freaking weird. (pop music playing in background) Morning. Welcome to our space. Have you got an appointment? Because we are... we're fully booked today. Perhaps you'd like to come back at another time? (grunts) Holy crap! Anton! Help me pick her up. Aw, jeez. Come on, go. Officer :  Need to see some ID. Thanks. Yep. (police radio chatter) Don't you ever go home, mate? Thank you. Thanks. Never. What's up, fellas? You boys hear about Dickson? Yeah. Yeah. They did the same to that Wells kid. Freaking subbies. Should just take them all out in the desert and shoot them. (laughs) That's right. Earning your paycheck, boys? ID. We're doing things the hard way today, are we? (scanner beeping) Why does he do it? Your husband... protecting those subbies. Why don't you ask him? You know, they killed a guard. When? Three of them broke out the containment center. Ripped the guard's heart right out his chest. Subbies are freaking animals. They used to say that about my people, too. (beeps) Waruu, call me. Don't make me worry. Oh, um, could somebody hold him? It's okay. You're going to be all right. Easy, Djukara. Nearly done. Just try and relax. Keep breathing deep. (door opens) What's going on, Waruu? We'll talk outside. It's all over the news. What are they saying? Dead guard, no heart. What? CA find this mob here, we're freaking gone. They're not going to find them. You crazy? You're trying to get us all killed. They didn't murder anyone. I was there. I don't know about any of that sh1t. They don't belong here. We're going to look after them. What do you want me to do, hand them over to the CA? Just get them to the gym. Harry can't. I need your help, Uncle. No, no, no. Get those pricks out of my sight. They're just kids! No different than Jake or Gub. We can't buy into any of this. It is bullshit. They want us to tear each other apart. Look. Let their own kind look after them. No, I want them away from Maliyan, under my care. (gasping) Please, please. Let me go. Please! Please, let me go. You're not going anywhere. What are you doing? I'm calling the hotline. Hey, let's think first before we call the CA. (panting) (gasps) We have a gold mine right here. People are paying a fortune for subbie hair. (panting) (pop music playing) Man :  Put some more weights on that rack. Here. Are you going to walk around in that? We have to get back to Djukara. There's some mattresses over there. Mungo :  How many Hairy brothers living in the Zone? Max :  Quite a mob. Well, shouldn't we hang out with them? Not a good idea. Lot of heat on you boys. Safer for you here. Cool. What else you got? You got any food? First bid: 500. Nice. 1,000. (gasps) Come on. 1,500. (woman gasps) Oh, my God, that's so much money. Anton :  Two grand. Two and a half. Come on. (scraping) Anton :  Nice one. At 35. (laughs) (helicopter approaching) (woman gasps) Keep looking. I want that Hairy found. (computer beeping) Man :  I found something. We can trace the IP. (door opens, closes) Hello, pet. I don't think we got the chance to introduce ourselves, did we? I'm Frankie. Not hungry? You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you, poor love? Perhaps you should have a bite to eat. (electricity crackles) (gasps) I need you to be healthy, so please eat. (door opens, closes) (electronic lock beeps) (phone ringing) McIntyre :  Yeah? Not busy, are you? Oh, we've got a young one on the loose in the city. It's a bloody headache, but we're closing in. That freaking idiot Matthews was in here earlier throwing his weight around. Careful, Steve. That's our elected representative you're talking about. (beeps) Any progress on the break and entry in the lab? Facial recognition threw up a Koen West. He runs a bar. West? Yeah. They're brothers. I checked with Births and Deaths. Well, they're half-brothers, to be precise. You want me to go into this bar, pick this guy up? Not yet. I need to think about that. I might head into the Zone. I'll need your checkpoint goons to not kick up a fuss. You want me in with you? Sir, it's pretty hairy in there at the moment. I'll be fine. 
 
 I need to talk to you. Those kids can't stay here. Just concentrate on the doctor stuff. Don't you patronize me. I just put my clinic on the line for you. It's under control. They murdered a man. They didn't. Well, that's not what the authorities are saying, and they're going to come after them. And who's going to look after all these people in the Zone if they shut it down? It's a setup by the CA. Even if it is, it still means that the clinic could get dragged into it. They have to go. (Djukara hyperventilating) Doc! You need to see this! Okay, um, hold him. Hold him, hold him. We need to flush his blood out. Alcohol. It's in the cupboard. Eve : Okay. Freaking shaver b*st*rd. Just go home, mate. Oi! (groans) Dude, what the... (groaning) Hey! That's enough! The frig are you? I said that's enough. Go on. Get out of here. (groaning) Hey. You all right? We need to get him to the clinic. You're all right. Just keep breathing, mate. (hyperventilating) Oh, guys, just hold him. Just hold him. Jarrod? Jeez. Just wait outside. We... Eve, help him out, will you? Anything I can do? No, it's a transfusion stuff-up. His whole system's melting down. We just... we don't know his blood type! What clan's he from? Think he's Billamanju. Who else in the Zone is Billamanju? Maliyan. I'll get him. Alinta! We'll leave. Charlotte :  Just wait. Wait. It should pass. Step away! Step away! On the ground! Okay. On the ground! Where's the subbie? Through there. Stay down. Suspect is still at large. We are dead. So, is the hair staying? There's so much of it. Frankie : Yes, that's the idea. That's what they're paying for. God, my man likes me waxed within an inch. That's because he's only got an inch. So has she got a name yet? Clients can call her what they like. My name is Araluen. We don't use our real names around here. Good. Introduction's over. We're all friends now, aren't we, pet? Scoot. That one. Thank you. Charlotte : Pulse is steady. Eve :  BP normal. So far, so good. You're a lifesaver. Thanks. I didn't do it for you. And thank you. I'm just going to check that kid outside. You okay? Yep. (sucks breath) Ooh, sorry. Nearly done. With any luck, you'll have a scar. (thunder rumbles) Girls love that. (rain pattering) You hear me. Not a word to anyone about what happened. Yeah? He's awake. We need to send a clear message that kind of behavior won't be tolerated. Will do. How you going in there? Illuminating. I've got to go. Impressive call you made about his clan. Where'd you get that? I'm just interested in a lot of different things... new, old, ancient, spiritual things. Things that aren't any of your business. It's lucky for that kid I'm a nosy b*st*rd, isn't it? You knew my uncle. I did, through the arts scene. I'm a collector. Jimmy had a good eye. Rubbish. Jimmy wouldn't know a dot painting from a Rembrandt. Why were you at his funeral? I was a friend. Never mentioned you. Maybe you weren't listening. Go to hell. Uncle Jimmy was the closest thing I had to a father. You people thought he was a drunken old fool, but I took care of him and he opened up to me, shared things with me. We learned together. Wasn't his place to do that. Jimmy thought it was. This is not yours to play with. It's not a game. You're a smart man. Be smart. You think what it might mean to combine ancient teachings with knowledge of the future. And then? Do what with it? What the hell did you and Jimmy do together? Things I would never have dreamed were possible. I know you think Jimmy was special, but I wouldn't trust everything he gave you. He chose the wrong Cleverman, didn't he? (music playing in background) Why'd your uncle give you that club? It's all connected, isn't it? It was meant to be my brother Waruu. There's been some cosmic stuff-up in the universe. I mean, he's been training to become the Cleverman ever since he was two. Cleverman? Is that why you can do stuff? I mean... you can heal. You can see things. You lied when you said you saw nothing the other day, didn't you? You saw something then. And you saw something again this morning. What did you see? You're seeing sh1t about me. What is it? (smoke alarm beeping) I hear a sound... some kind of alarm. I see the bar. I see you. I see blood. Maybe you're right. Maybe they did get the wrong guy. Frankie :  Chin up, pet. Yes. Oh, that's lovely. What do you think? Real? Frankie :  Every follicle. Now, look at me. (Geoff breathing heavily) (chuckles) (door opens, closes) (electronic lock beeps) (computer beeping) (chattering) Hey. Aw, you suck. Shut up. It hurts. Aw, man, harden up. Freaking Hairies. It's all their fault. Hey, stop it. You're better than that. Your friend's still in there. You want to see him? Hey, man! You look good, bruz. Man, we thought you were gone. What's with the clean skin? They made us do it. Who? The fellow who busted us out. He organized everything. That fellow's my dad. I'd say you've earned that. Thanks. Why did you come into the Zone today? I came to take you to lunch. Really? I'm glad you did, or we would have had two dead kids on our hands. I like watching you work. We make a good team. Yeah, we do. My line in the sand... I never stopped to consider what it meant for you. Are you sure you're okay with that decision? I mean, really okay? I'm okay. You don't need an heir? I hate a competitor. Jarrod : I have to duck back to the network. I know. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Can't be helped. (music playing in background) (chattering) It's called a lemon twist. Makes the drink look pretty. It means that we can charge more. Hey, hey, hey. Stay with me. Come on. We were getting somewhere. What do you want? I'm good for the moment. I wanted to say how sorry I am about your uncle. I was a friend of his. I'd like to offer my condolences. You sure you don't want a drink? You know, you look a lot like him. Must be the beard. It's a dead giveaway. It's the eyes. It's an unusual thing, heterochromia iridus. What do you want? Your uncle's eyes were caused by something else, though, weren't they? It's the same reason your eyes are different colors. Who the hell are you? Jimmy and I worked together. He shared his knowledge with me, and it was very lucrative for him. I'd like to offer you the same opportunity. I've got everything I need right here. Really? This bar? You have worlds at your feet and you don't even know it. I didn't catch your name. I'm Koen. Jarrod Slade. Maybe a drink another time. (distant dog barking) (vehicle approaching) (police radio chatter) Hey! Oh, it's all right. I know a back way. You want to come with me? Load them up. Ready, bruz? Yeah, bruz. Right, set... (groans) Struggling. (all laugh) I ain't struggling. Struggling. All right, you can sleep up there for tonight. Latani? You made it. You're safe. Mom? Dad? They killed Jyra. I know. Why did you attack them? Huh? Dad told you to keep your head down. What did you think would happen? You were outnumbered and they were armed. You blame me? If you had just listened... Jyra would still be alive today. So, what? We outlive them Dad's way? In case you haven't noticed, that hasn't been working. (sobs) You all right? (footsteps approach) Hey, Frankie's happy. You must have done well. Remember when they arrested you? I saw it on the TV. I'm sorry about what happened to your little girl. Do you have children? Yeah, I got two. I got a boy that's five and a little girl, Sophie, six. Mine was Jyra. That's a pretty name. I have other children, too. Just before you ask, I can't help you. Please. I need to be with my family. Just don't ask me again. (crying) What's going on in there? (whispers echoing) (whispers continue) (whispers continue) (whispers fade) (train clacking) Belinda on TV :  ...renewed pressure on the government's containment policies. Three subhumans broke out of protective custody early today, murdering a containment center guard in what appears to be emerging as their trademark attack... the victim left with his heart torn from his body. It brings to date three confirmed deaths. There appears to be no pattern in the attacks, the victims differing in age and circumstances. You old b*st*rd. What were you wrapped up in, eh? I got your feed here. Sorry it's late. You want to eat it now? Want a glass of water? How are you doing? I'm okay. What about you? Yeah, good. Pair of liars, aren't we? (groans) I wish you'd get a second opinion. Nah, it's meant to be. Can't muck with karma. I love you. You're always looking after me. I appreciate it. I'll see you soon. Mm-hmm. Have a feed. (distant voices echoing) Don't you have a hug for your mum? (lock unbolts) (sighs) I've been calling you all day. Is there anything I need to know? (sighs) Babe. Hey. Come on. (doorknob rattles) Will you please let me in? I just want to talk. (alarms blaring) Dickson : What am I up against, huh? (grunting) (alarms blaring) (grunting) (grunts) (bird screeching)
