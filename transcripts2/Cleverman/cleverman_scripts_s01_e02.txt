 Humans are free to come and go from the Zone area as they wish, but Hairies who try and exit the Zone will be detained. 
 It's alright, we're not gonna hurt you. 
 Nice doing business with you. You screw us and you'll pay. 
 I'd like to report a sighting - a family of five. 
 Prepare a retrieval process. 
 (Man groans) 
 Slade : 80,000 years, the Hairypeople have been on this planet. 
 I've had enough. Take it. You're a man now, son. 
 Jimmy's been off the rails of late, but he was, at heart, a good man. 
 And I hope, as his next in line, to do the same. 
 Kora : Ngaluunggirr. 
 How are you going, guys? Straight passes. Lilly, straight passes. 
 Cam, you've gotta focus on this. This is a weak area for you. 
 Just kick it straight. 
 Lilly : Come on! 
 Kick it straight. Come on, mate. That's not good enough. 
 On the game on Saturday, you let yourself down 'cause you weren't doing it, OK? 
 Straight as an arrow. Let's go. 
 Cam... 
 Lilly : Loser. 
 ...go and get it. 
 Go and get it. Go on. 
 (Scoffs) 
 Grab this one. 
 Good. 
 (Rustling) 
 (Cam screams) 
 (Growling and thudding) 
 Cam?

 See some ID? 
 Kora : Ngaluunggirr. 
 Mother... 
 He's alright. 
 Waruu : Dad loved me more than he loved you, Koen! 
 Your mum is a white whore. Say it! 
 Boys : Come on, say it! 
 Koen, say your mum is a white whore. 
 Say it, Koen! Say it! No! 
 Your mum is a white whore. 
 You coconut. 
 You! 
 What you doing out here, brother? 
 Don't suppose you take a direct deposit? 
 Oi! I don't want you boys fighting around here, you hear me? 
 I forgot what flat you were, Aunty Linda. 
 Who's that? 
 I need to talk, Aunty. 
 Koen? 
 Yeah. 
 OK. You better come up, then. 
 Piss off, you hairy buggers. He's family. 
 (♪ ROCK MUSIC ♪) 
 Hey, Aunty! (Knocks) Hey! 
 Koen, come in! 
 Look at you all grown up. 
 (Turns off music) 
 I'm hoping you can tell me why Uncle Jimmy picked me. 
 I gave up wondering why Jimmy did what he did. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Waruu's going to be mighty pissed off. 
 Ever since you two were little, Waruu's been dreaming of becoming the Cleverman. 
 He's been waiting for this day all his life, now his little brother... 
 Half-brother. 
 Steals his thunder. 
 It's a big responsibility, Koen. 
 Cleverman is more than just a title. 
 (Exhales) 
 Whatever reason Jimmy had, you got a chance to start over. 
 Here. 
 This belonged to your father. Kept his uni stuff in it. 
 Where'd you get that? 
 Found it, after the accident. 
 I put other stuff in photos, anything I could grab at the time, which wasn't much. 
 The past is the past. 
 Can't change it. 
 All you can do is try to do better. 
 Your father, he wasn't perfect. 
 He was a man, with all the faults of a man. 
 And he was your father. 
 Your gift, Koen. That's yours and yours alone now. 
 No-one can tell you what to do with it. 
 That's the good of it and the curse of it, mark my words. 
 I see things too. 
 What kind of things? 
 You in a clinic. 
 Cancer. 
 All through my lymph nodes. Doctors gave me six months. 
 They can't treat it? 
 Better medication at home. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can get you more gear if you need it. 
 You saw all that, eh? 
 What are you gonna do with it? 
 Oi. Stop it. 
 You don't need a title. 
 Cleverman's not just a title. 
 Alinta : Dad? Harry's here. 
 Harry : We need to take some action here. 
 Waruu : Yeah, yeah, I know. 
 Where's the rest of that family they captured, then? 
 Alinta, can you get my phone, please? 
 I've got something to show you. These were taken last week. 
 So what are they? 
 Trucks, 20 of them in one day. 
 (Line rings) 
 Hey, stranger. 
 You don't know what they're transporting in those trucks? 
 Could just be frozen chicken. 
 Frozen chickens don't need ventilation. 
 So what next? 
 I found a guy on the inside, Waruu. 
 Says he can get us into the main cells. 
 A guard? 
 Yeah. 
 He has a master key to the building. 
 Look, say we get in, then what? Bust every Hairy out of there? 
 What are you gonna do with them? Are you gonna bring them here? 
 Give the CA the excuse they've been waiting for? 
 We'll be ready for them when they do. 
 Choppers, assault vehicles, high-powered weapons. Nah, brother. I got family here. 
 We all got families! 
 This is a political situation, Harry. It needs a political fix. 
 Come on, man! If it was Alinta in there... 
 Political fix, Harry, why I'm going on this show, yeah? 
 We got to do this the right way. 
 (Bangs on door) 
 Oi! You shouldn't be doing that. 
 Hey, brother, they'll flog ya! 
 What do you think you're doing, rug? 
 Everyone eat cement! 
 I knew you were going to cause trouble for us, rug. 
 You think you're king of the rugs or something, do ya? 
 Come on, then! 
 Oi! Oi, get your hands off him! 
 (Footsteps approaching) 
 (Knock at door) 
 Virgil : Girl? 
 I know you're in there. 
 I know you must be hungry too. 
 (Clanking) 
 (Footsteps receding) 
 (Knock at door) 
 Leave the plate out, if you wouldn't mind. 
 Or I'm in B27, if you care to visit. 
 Alright, then. 
 (Footsteps receding) 
 Stop filming. Put your cameras away. Turn it off. 
 You people are not supposed to be here. 
 We were the first on the scene. There's no other news crews here. 
 There's not gonna be anyone else either. 
 It's our exclusive for the next hour, at least. 
 How? 
 We'll break the story in the middle of the show, cross to you. So be ready to go. 
 OK. We should let Waruu know about this development, give him a chance to prepare his response. 
 Let me think about it. 
 (Sighs) 
 Why didn't you say something? 
 I couldn't bear to see you put on that brave-little-boy face. 
 I see you've relegated America to the dustbin of history. 
 No, the US gets a placemat for outstanding achievement. 
 It's the whole of Western civilisation that's down the plughole. 
 Perhaps it's just as well, then, that I can't... 
 Baby, we can try again. 
 No, we... 
 We've been over this. 
 You know, Nixon had a speech already prepared for the death of the astronauts. 
 They were so desperate to beat the Ruskies, they went up ahead of schedule, more on a hope and a prayer. 
 Are you going to tell the story about Neil Armstrong restarting the landing module with just a paperclip and seconds to spare? 
 It was Buzz Aldrin... 
 ...and it was a biro. 
 The point is that, often, the only difference between triumph and failure... 
 My love... 
 ...I'm not giving up, I'm just... 
 I'm drawing a line in the sand. 
 It's all good, baby. 
 Sorry. 
 (Thinks) I am the Cleverman. 
 I am the Cleverman. 
 I am the Cleverman. 
 Through this way. 
 Stop! 
 What have you got for me? 
 One of these. 
 One? 
 Just f*ckin' pick one. 
 It's not that simple, darling. 
 They're all as hairy as each other. 
 One's as good as the next. 
 Haven't you ever been to the pound? 
 You don't just take any old Shih tzu. 
 When's my money going to come through, huh? 
 Do you understand me, pet? 
 That one's English isn't great. 
 Shame that. I do need English. 
 Take me. 
 (Chortles) 
 Aren't you a feisty one? 
 And what is it you think you're volunteering for, love? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Smile for me. 
 Teeth. 
 Hands. 
 Good, not too big. 
 Pelt's a gorgeous colour. You all natural? 
 Yes? 
 Good. Lucky girl. 
 You're older than I'd like. 
 I'll do what you want. 
 Oh, yes, you will. Won't you, pet? 
 Yes, I've found what I need. 
 Sorry, ladies. 
 (Footsteps approaching) 
 Hello again. 
 The disappearing girl. 
 Thanks for returning it. 
 It was just out of a jar, but it fills the hole. 
 My name's Virgil. 
 It's a strange name, but I've lived with it a long time. 
 Hi. 
 Will you join me for tea? 
 I know what you are, and I don't care. 
 Good evening, I'm Jane O'Grady. And tonight, the subhuman crisis. 
 We evaluate the Government's approach to its handling of the subhuman conundrum. 
 Take a seat, if you'd like. 
 Watch it with me. 
 Just move that stuff off. Sit. 
 Please. 
 Tonight, my guest in the studio is Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Geoff Matthews. 
 Good to be here, Jane. 
 Also with me is my guest, Mr Waruu West, Indigenous community leader and advocate for the Hairypeoples. 
 Mr West, welcome. 
 I'm here as community leader in the Zone. 
 Thanks for having me on the program. 
 He's a bit of a spunk! 
 Minister, I'll start with you and the announcement today that the Government is committing another 107 million to its new subhuman containment and resettlement efforts. 
 I'll jump in there, Jane, and question the terminology being used, in language that would make George Orwell proud. 
 What you're really talking about here is the forcible removal of innocent people from their homes, separating mothers from daughters, fathers from sons. 
 The truth is, this Government is tearing whole families, entire communities apart, and taking them God only knows where. 
 I can't discuss operational matters. 
 Suffice to say, it is not anything like Mr West is making out. 
 That's a relief, Minister, thank you. 
 They are well provided for in clean, safe accommodation. 
 Well, let's see them. 
 Linta! 
 Linta! 
 Alinta : What? 
 Hurry up. Your dad's on TV. 
 Better still, tell us where these containment centres are so we can see them for ourselves. 
 Why the secrecy? 
 Well, for the protection... 
 You only hide something if you have something to hide. 
 Mr West favours integration. 
 I'm sympathetic to that as a possible long-term solution, but this is a complex question... 
 Tighter, Camera 1. 
 ...this government is working hard to find a solution for. 
 These are very serious issues. 
 We have a large population of subhumans. 
 They're people, Geoff. 
 Can we just accept that they are not sub anything, but people? 
 Why don't you allow reporters into your containment centres? 
 Give us a guided tour, on camera. 
 It's a simple matter of security. 
 Rosie, who's that? 
 Ah, West's right-hand man. 
 Give me a close-up on his hands. 
 As long as the country keeps voting for us, that's what we'll do. 
 He's a shaved-down Hairy. Look at his little finger. 
 In addition to that, we have to protect the privacy of our containment clients. 
 So they don't have a right to a trial, but that doesn't matter because you're protecting their privacy? 
 Subhumans are an innately violent race. 
 Not true. Come on, day one, first contact, one tried to rip the throat out of a police sergeant. 
 People become violent for a reason. 
 Would you like to elaborate? 
 Hairypeople are concerned that their people are disappearing. 
 Trucks come in the middle of the night and take them... 
 Total fabrication. 
 Geoff, sorry, I'll have to ask you to hold on. 
 Mr West, could you clarify what you mean? 
 Does he have any proof of these allegations? 
 People have come to me... 
 Mr West cannot keep making these slanderous accusations. 
 Excuse me, Minister, the Zone was not your creation. 
 If it wasn't for Aboriginal people occupying the old railway station, there wouldn't be a Zone. 
 It has become a vibrant and diverse suburb in this city. 
 We welcome the Hairypeople to live with us. 
 Look at this big man. 
 You're the ones that put up a wall. 
 You're the ones that built a checkpoint. 
 You're the ones who issued ID cards, and now you won't take any responsibility. 
 Could you clarify what you mean by 'disappearing?' 
 People have come to me... 
 Hairypeople? 
 ...have complained to me that ever since Emergence Day, Hairy brothers and sisters began to disappear one by one. 
 Uh, I'm sorry, I'm just receiving a feed from the newsroom. 
 Alright. 
 And to people at home, I'm sorry, we're going to have to interrupt our regular program with a story that's just breaking. 
 Crossing live now. Cue Belinda. 
 Shocking news just at hand of the death of 12-year-old schoolboy, Cameron Wells, who was viciously attacked and murdered while at soccer training at a local park earlier this evening. 
 It is thought that his death might be linked to a similar attack only last week on one James West. 
 A warning to viewers at home, people may find the following images distressing. 
 There's a terrible sense of despair and growing fear at tonight's events, Jane, and not just because of Cameron's tender age, but the particularly brutal way in which he was killed in front of his clubmates. 
 Can you confirm the cause of death? 
 We have to wait for the Coroner's report. 
 The heart was removed from the boy's chest in much the same manner as James West's? 
 There's been no confirmation for the precise nature of the killing or species of the killer. 
 But if it is true that subhuman peoples have incredibly strong fingernails, it wouldn't be too far a stretch to say that this crime might be the work of a Hairyperson? 
 At this stage, the police aren't ruling anything out. 
 It's just yet another terrifying prospect for our already frightened communities to have to manage. 
 Distressing news, Belinda. 
 We'll be crossing back for updates as the story unfolds... 
 
 
 
 (Roars) 
 How dare you people use my uncle's death to manipulate public perception? 
 What happened to Cameron is a tragedy, but we must be very careful not to jump the gun here. 
 It's important that everybody remain calm in the face of this new... 
 They said things about my people from time to time, that we ate children, turned Christian children into matzo. 
 I think I know how this story ends. Shall we watch something else? 
 Our patience, as a nation, with the subhuman issue... 
 I'm sorry about your family. That young girl, was that...? 
 My sister. 
 Waruu, one final question for you, then. 
 In Aboriginal storytelling, sometimes referred to as Dreamtime, is it true that fathers would warn their children not to leave camp for fear of what the Hairypeople might do? 
 Firstly, it's the Dreaming, present tense. 
 Our stories are not static. 
 They're not locked in the past, just as Hairypeople are not bound by what is. 
 I'm not sure I'm understanding. 
 Look, I will say this, over the course of our history, Hairypeople have lived side by side, in peace, so peaceful, in fact, none of us knew they existed till six months ago. 
 What happened to Cameron Wells is truly regrettable, but we can't jump to conclusions. 
 We must let the judicial system handle this, not the media. 
 Wrapping-up time. 
 Gentlemen, thank you very much for coming on the program tonight. 
 Thank you, Jane. 
 See? That's how you get f*cked, Waruu. 
 You bastards set me up. 
 And what makes you a spokesperson for your people, hm? 
 You never finished high school, you don't have a job. 
 You live on government handouts and your wife's salary. 
 Unlike you, I did my homework. 
 Mr West, I just want to thank you. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Harry. 
 What am I thinking? 
 p0rn. 
 (Laughs) 
 Ah! 
 Alright. 
 What about now? 
 Bestiality p0rn. 
 You're a b*st*rd! 
 No, really, what did you see? 
 You're a dirty dog. 
 (Both laugh) 
 I'll drink to that. 
 With lemons! 
 Agh! What are you doing to me, brother? 
 Keep talking! Keep talking! How does it feel? 
 Ahhh! 
 It stings. 
 Hot, cold? 
 Cold. sh1t, look! 
 Look, look! 
 It still hurting? 
 Less. 
 See, that was, what, like, seven seconds... ish? 
 Ish. 
 Is it healed on the inside? 
 Oh no. 
 No, it's still tender. 
 That demonstrates a level of awesomeness that is truly bad-arse. 
 Go again, go again! 
 Don't you do that again! 
 His body heals itself! 
 Put it down! 
 I was just playing. 
 Kora : Ngaluunggirr. 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 Hey? I'm sorry, babe. 
 You still love me, though, eh? 
 (Phone line rings) 
 Belinda  (on phone): Well, hello. 
 I told you about what happened to my uncle in confidence. 
 Yeah, I understand, and I'm sorry, but this is my job. You know that. 
 Go to hell. 
 Kora : Ngaluunggirr. 
 That eye still weirds me out. 
 I'm just getting static. 
 (Cries out) 
 Koen, what's happening? 
 I'm OK, alright? Just... 
 It's just my head. 
 I'm fine, really. 
 I want to be left alone. 
 (Sighs) 
 Kora : (Whispers eerily) Ngaluunggirr. 
 Hey. 
 Come to bed. 
 (Machinery whirrs) 
 You're awake, are you? 
 How old are you? 
 How old are YOU? 
 I'm 71. 
 I'm 16. 
 Your people live a long time, don't they, hundreds of years? 
 And here you are, 16. 
 I'm 15. 
 (Laughs) Fif...! 
 (Laughs and coughs) 
 Oh, that's not fair! That's not fair, to make me laugh like that. 
 Oh, don't ever get old, love. 
 Everyone treats you like you're an idiot. 
 Fifteen! 
 Hey, you want to have some breakfast? I've got some cereal. 
 On the bench. Can you...? 
 What's your plan, girl? 
 My family are gonna come back for me. 
 Your family are not coming back, girl. 
 You can stay, with me, I mean, as long as you like... 
 ...but they'll eventually find you. 
 Hey, I can help you. 
 I make things. 
 But you have to decide who it is you want to be. 
 Djukara? 
 Djukara! 
 Dad. 
 Where's Mum? Where's Latani? 
 I don't know. 
 Boss. 
 I'm memorising every door code and key I see. 
 I'm figuring a way out. 
 The main thing is, we stay alive. 
 Yeah, and get out of here. 
 That's not what I'm saying, son. 
 Dad, they killed Jirra. There's no way this doesn't end in blood. 
 Dickson : Hey, rug! What's going on down there? 
 Nothing, boss. 
 Why don't you mind your own business? 
 What'd you just say to him? 
 Told him he was a young, foolish boy. 
 Oh, is that it? Sounded like more than that. 
 Told him he had to fit in. 
 In this society, we have to be social. 
 We can all live together. 
 (Laughs) 
 Yeah! Yeah, that's right. 
 Yeah. 
 Socialise. 
 Once you all learn that, everything's going to be just fine. 
 Yes, boss. 
 Yes, boss. 
 You know what, rug? You got your head screwed on right. 
 What's your name? 
 Boondee. 
 Yeah, I'm not going to use that jungle sh1t. 
 I'm going to call you... 
 ...Trevor. 
 Yes, boss. 
 You finish up here, Trevor. 
 But you would rather clean their floors. 
 So why don't you do your job? Make them sparkle, slave! 
 Just keep an eye on her, and if there's any sign of temperature, just bring her straight back in, OK? 
 See ya! 
 Wow! I like the flowers. 
 That's good, they're for you. 
 The delivery guy nearly shat himself, such a hurry to get out of the place. 
 Everything alright? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 (Phone line rings) 
 They're beautiful flowers, Jarrod. Thanks. 
 I was worried you wouldn't get them. 
 They were adamant they didn't deliver to the Zone. 
 Had to pay a huge loading fee. 
 Darling, it's just you and me. It's us. 
 How about we give it one more try, go back to the clinic? 
 If nothing happens... 
 I can't. I just... 
 Can you please not ask me again? 
 I'm building an ark for us. 
 Look, I probably should get back to work. Sorry, what did you say? 
 Nothing. 
 Hang in there, my love. 
 (Sighs) 
 Get up. 
 Get the f*ck up! 
 Get up, monkey! Come here! 
 These are for you. An ID card. Carry that with you day and night. 
 And the lenses, to cover your eyes. 
 Oh, no. I hate goodbyes. 
 You just do what you have to do to survive. 
 I don't know if I can. 
 Remember, you're much faster and stronger than they are. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm. 
 (Device buzzes) 
 Hey, monkey, you ever heard of a whipping boy? 
 (Cries out) 
 (Electrical zapping) 
 Back in England, they used to think that kings were appointed by God. 
 You see, that made it very hard to discipline a young prince. 
 You couldn't give him the back of your hand 'cause he was God's special boy. 
 You like to think that you're God's special little boy, don't you, monkey? 
 I'm going to kill you! 
 Ah. 
 There, you interrupted my story. 
 (Zapping) 
 (Screams) 
 So anyway, someone had a bright idea. 
 Instead of punishing the prince when he misbehaved, they'd punish his best friend, and the prince would feel bad 'cause his friend was being punished for something he had done. 
 But we've got someone better than your best friend. 
 Bring him in! 
 So from now on, when you're a bad little boy who won't behave... 
 (Cries out) 
 Leave my father alone, please! Beat me! 
 We already beat you, but you didn't learn what we were trying to teach! 
 I get it! 
 I don't think you do. 
 (Screams) 
 Please stop it! Stop it! 
 You had your chance. 
 Please! Don't hurt my father. 
 Huh? Rules will be followed, won't they? 
 Yes, they will. 
 Thank you! 
 (Thud!) 
 Get him up. 
 We're not finished yet. 
 Harry : Brother, I'm a Hairy, and you're telling me we go into a prison full of Hairies who are being tortured, and we just film. 
 What's the f*cking point of that? 
 To show Joe Public what Matthews is so desperate for them not to see. 
 This is all about sticking it up Matthews. 
 People need to know. People don't give a sh1t. 
 We're not like them, so they don't care. 
 You're wrong. They don't know any better because they're because manipulated by the Government. 
 You can say that 'cause you're not a Hairy. 
 I have to live it every day. 
 Don't tell me I don't get it, I'm a blackfella. 
 You heard what Matthews said to me in there - 
 I'm a pariah in my own country. 
 We go in with cameras or we don't go in at all. 
 Up! 
 Prisoner : Leave him alone, you dogs! 
 Prisoner : Come on! 
 (Shavers buzz) 
 (Djukara sobs) 
 Prisoner : Stay strong, bro. 
 Dickson : Happy, Trevor? 
 Free haircut. 
 Kora : (Whispers eerily) Ngaluunggirr. 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 Ngaluunggirr! 
 (Groans) 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 (Groans) 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 Ngaluunggirr! 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 (Cries out) 
 Blair : Oi, shut up! 
 (Grunts) 
 Are you having a wank? 
 Keep it down, mate. My girlfriend... 
 (Groans) 
 Hey, you know if you need a sick day, all you've got to do is ask. 
 This girl keeps calling me! 
 Bro, what's going on? You're starting to weird me out. 
 Don't you hear that? 
 Hear what, bruz? 
 The voice! 
 The voice? 
 I've got to find her. 
 Hey! Find who? 
 Come on! 
 Where are we going? 
 I don't know! 
 OK. I'm driving. 
 Go left. 
 Bloody speed bumps. 
 Left, left! Left! 
 Are you sure, bruz? 
 Yes, left! 
 Stop. 
 What, stop? 
 Stop! 
 (Tyres squeal) 
 Right. 
 Sure? 
 Right! 
 OK, I'm going right! 
 (Grunts) Right again, right again. 
 It's a car park, man. 
 Go down! 
 Go, go, go, go! 
 Going down, man. 
 Trust me, Blair, she is here. 
 Stop, stop. 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 Here? 
 This way. 
 Oi, bro, you alright? 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 She's in this building. 
 Did she happen to say which floor? 
 Top floor. 
 No.9, my lucky number! 
 Ngaluunggirr! 
 Oi! 
 Here. 
 Come on. There's nothing here! 
 It IS here! It has to be. 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 This way. 
 Ngaluunggirr! 
 Who let you in here? 
 Uh, hi. We're just here from cleaning services. 
 We're, um, here to look around, give you an obligation-free quote. 
 You need to leave now. 
 Excuse me? 
 You need to leave now. 
 It's three o'clock. We had a... 
 Jesus! Koen, what are you...?! 
 Where is she? 
 She in there? 
 Blair, get the door. 
 OK. 
 Please. 
 It's locked. 
 Ngaluunggirr. 
 No, please don't. 
 What are you...? 
 (Beeps) 
 What is this place? 
 Oi! What are you doing to her? 
 OK. Please. 
 (Alarm) 
 Bro, we got to get out of here! 
 Let's go. 
 You're coming with me. 
 (Siren wails) 
 You in? 
 I got her, I got her. 
 Go! 
 Hey, hey, wait, I know the code for the door. 
 Leave it!
