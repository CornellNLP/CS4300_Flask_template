 Previously on Gotham... 
 I'm sorry you had to get mixed up in this. 
 'Cause I'm sure you're a good, honest girl, really. 
 (choking) 
 I'm gonna disappear. You can't do that. 
 I wasn't asking. You can't disappear. 
 You have to come back home with me. 
 When Detective Gordon finds the man who killed my parents, you have to testify. 
 Falcone : I want these two alive for now. 
 You dare use my sainted mother against me? 
 You'll suffer for that. 
 Say your good-byes quickly. 
 Miss Mooney has places to go. 
 Hello, Fish. 
 (chuckling) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (chuckles softly) 
 Well, you must be the B team. 
 We just handle transpo. 
 Bob will be taking care of you. 
 Bob. 
 One of our top guys. 
 You're in good hands. 
 Good morning. 
 You're up early. 
 I haven't made it to bed yet. 
 Word is you got caught with Doc Thompkins in the locker room. 
 Strictly business. 
 Any word on Fish? 
 No. 
 Club's all shot up, blood everywhere, no sign of Fish. 
 It's her own damn fault. 
 She played the game, she knew the risks. 
 Sorry, Harv, I know you have a thing for her. 
 I don't got a thing for nobody. 
 My thing is for me. 
 If anyone can make it out of a scrape like that, it's Fish the woman's nails. 
 Come on, we got a case. 
 Yeah. What do we got? 
 Public service homicide. 
 Vic's a douche. 
 Flass. Gordon. 
 Gordon. Flass. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Bullock : Flass works Narcotics. 
 Hence the bling and the, uh, no doubt expensive yet somehow cheap-looking Italian suit. 
 Ah, Bullock, still dressing in the dark and smelling like a taphouse whore. 
 One of Flass's connections tipped him off on the body. 
 Why don't you tell Gordon about the kid. 
 Pinky Littlefield. 
 Dealer from a crew known as the Uptown Assassins. 
 He works this block. Well... least he did. 
 Any drugs on him? 
 Didn't find any. 
 My big wild guess: deal gone bad. 
 Kid like this, bound to happen sooner or later. 
 Like I said, public service homicide. 
 Well, boys, I've got another case I've got to attend to, so if you don't need any more hand-holding. 
 I'm gonna walk you out. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Bullock : Hey, unis think they may have found a witness. 
 Night janitor. 
 They're bringing him over. 
 Jim, Mr. Winkler. 
 Sir. 
 No need for the formalities. 
 Call me Leon. 
 Leon. 
 We really appreciate you stepping forward. 
 My wife Louisa always says, if you don't step forward, you step back. 
 She sounds like a smart lady. 
 Yes, she is. 
 So, uh, do I give a statement? 
 A description of the killer? 
 I'm not sure how this works. 
 Would you be willing to come down to the precinct, work with a sketch artist? 
 That really is the best way to catch the killer. 
 It'd be a huge help. 
 (sighs) Of course. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Yes, sweetheart, I'm still at the precinct. 
 I know. 
 Of course, yeah. 
 Well... okay. 
 They send in the sketch artist yet? 
 No, not yet. 
 Louisa, I have to go. 
 Bye-bye. 
 But you did see the killer, right? 
 Uh, yes, that's what I told the detectives earlier. 
 I'm sorry, who are you? 
 How the hell did this happen? 
 Security cameras inside and outside the room were turned off. 
 Ed, you got any thoughts on the weapon? 
 What's strong enough to smash ships but still fears the sun? 
 Can it with the riddles, Ed. 
 I don't have the patience today or any day. 
 Ice. Correct. 
 Gauging by the small circumference of the wounds, I believe the weapon is an ice pick. 
 Carbon steel, six inches long. 
 Driven in deep enough that it marked the surrounding tissue with an imprint of a distinctive hexagonal handle. 
 It's not your standard kitchen fare. 
 Fun fact, gentlemen: Mr. Winkler's wounds here are the exact same as the wounds on the victim from this morning. 
 The drug dealer? Littlefield? 
 Him. Same weapon. 
 Same killer, one would suppose. 
 Damn it. 
 Right in our house. 
 Okay. 
 What is your name? 
 You know who I am. 
 It's just a formality. 
 I... like to be sure. 
 Bob, hmm? 
 Is that short for Robert? 
 You have any family, Robert? 
 Two lovely daughters. 
 I'm putting you down as Maria Mercedes Mooney, aka Fish. 
 We'll be extracting a very sincere apology from you today. 
 Shouldn't take too long. 
 How old are your girls, Robert? 
 I bet you they're some ugly little creatures. 
 (chuckles softly) 
 Now, come on, Fish. 
 No call for rudeness. 
 Only my friends call me Fish, darling. 
 And you and I, we're not friends.. yet. 
 (cackling) 
 Gotham S01E13 
Original air date 26th January, 2015 
 (engine stops) 
 You go get him. 
 I got to find the keys to the incinerator. 
 (horn blaring) 
 Hey, Marco. 
 (horn continues blaring) 
 (grunting) 
 Where's... Fish... Mooney? 
 How is anyone gonna trust us to keep them safe? 
 We can't protect people in our own house. 
 Upside is the place is crawling with criminals, so we got beaucoup suspects to choose from. 
 That's an upside? 
 Security cameras were turned off. 
 Could've been a cop. 
 Probably was. 
 You do not even think something like that. 
 The second that those guys out there hear that you're looking at a cop, they are gonna turn on you. 
 Bullock's right; you start pointing fingers, you could jeopardize your reinstatement. 
 You need concrete evidence to even think of accusing another officer of murder. 
 I'll start with the guard duty logbook. 
 Jim... Winkler was my witness. 
 No way I'm letting this ride. 
 I asked him to come in here; I'm gonna find his killer. 
 No matter who it is. 
 Proceed with caution. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 No big moves without my say-so. 
 Alfred : I do believe this is the second time we've been around this block, Master Bruce. 
 Selina likes to hang out here. 
 It's worth doubling back. 
 Besides, you got what you wanted. 
 I went out of town like you asked. 
 For weeks. 
 Yeah, well... it wasn't safe here, was it? 
 The assassins weren't after me. 
 They were after her. 
 Alfred : Yeah, and we'll be back on that plane straight back to Master Bruce. Master Bruce, get back in the car now. Can we walk around the block just once? Then I'll get back in the car. Please, Alfred. Once around the block and then home. Thank you. Got the rest of your life like that to get whipped into a frenzy by the females. I don't know why you want to start now. It's not like that. Ivy : Out of my way. Ivy? Steady, Master Bruce. Looks like she's got the mange. Look who it is. Billionaire Bruce Wayne. Who are you, his bodyguard? If needs be, miss, yes. What's in the bag? It's for Selina. Have you seen her? Sure. I can give it to her if you want. Perhaps you could pass on a message for me. (thunder rumbling softly) Tell her I'm looking for her. 20 bucks. Alfred. (sighs) 20 bucks. There we are, miss. Delightful friends you have, Master Bruce. Home. (gasping) That's all you got? You are gonna bore me to death, fella. That's impressive. Different strokes, eh? (grunting) You know, me, I can't stand hot spicy food, but my wife, you know, she loves it. Hotter the better. Now where, oh, where are we gonna begin? (drill whirring) Now, taking off a hand, that's devastating. But I've found that taking out a knee... (grunting) You okay, Fish? A page is missing from this logbook. Now, that in and of itself is grounds for dismissal from the force. So my question to you is who was on guard duty outside of interrogation this morning? No idea, man. Gordon : Nobody's talking. They're protecting their own. Or they just don't like you. Face it, Harvey. Leon Winkler's killer is a cop. Not proven. Come on, you know these guys. You've known them since way back. Give me some leverage. Give me an angle. You really want to work with a murderer? Somebody gets whacked in the GCPD. Somebody's gonna get fired for this. (scoffs) Not me, pal. Grover. We got a reliable guy says it was you pulled the page from the guard duty logbook. No way. W Where did you get that? Who said that? Alvarez. If he said that, that son of a bitch is lying. Why would he lie? Look, six years ago, I had a thing with his wife, okay? Six years ago. He is a vindictive b*st*rd. Well, look, that's none of our business, huh? Look at it from our point of view. We got to find the culprit. Brass demands one. But it wasn't me. Then who was it? Delaware? Anybody seen Delaware? Saw him go to the garage. Hey. Delaware. Hey! (engine starts) Hey! (tires screeching) You're gonna regret that. You were guarding interrogation this morning, weren't you? Screw off. ♪ ♪ (grunts) Bullock : Jim. What the hell are you doing? You couldn't bring him in here quietly, put him in some back room? You making some kind of statement? Damn right I am. I warned you and you didn't listen. I have evidence: the same drugs I found in Littlefield's shoe at the crime scene yesterday morning. That evidence is part of an ongoing undercover narco investigation. You expect us to believe that? Jim, narco's been knee-deep in the Uptown drug trade for months. I've got a matrix of undercovers that have put their lives at stake for this investigation. Your little stunt gets out, you unravel the whole operation. Not to mention, the search was illegal. So we're ignoring Delaware's involvement in Winkler's death? Is that what we're doing, Cap? No. But this isn't the way, Jim. I'm turning over the case to Internal Affairs. I.A.? Two old drunks in the basement. You and Bullock are no longer investigating the Winkler murder. What about the Littlefield murder? Or, wait, is that also a part of an ongoing narco investigation? All you, buddy. Let me know if you need any help. I'm sorry about the confusion. (gasps) Can I help you with something? Did you know, Miss Kringle, that the earliest greeting cards dated back to Germany in the 1400s? I have a lot of work to do. This is for you. Doesn't say anything weird, does it? No, ma'am. (giggles) Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy. (sighs) Take it easy. I'm fine, Butch. Here, try this. (sighs) You okay? I'm starving. (laughs) (thunder rumbling softly) (sighs) You are one tough cookie. Thank you, Butch. Listen, we should hit the road. I figure we've got about an hour before Falcone... Oh, I'm not going anywhere until I find Penguin. He's the one that told Falcone about Liza. Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss, I don't know if you remember, but as of last night, we don't have any men. Falcone's gonna have the whole city looking for us. I'm not going anywhere until I cut Penguin's throat. One... two... three. (gasps) What do you think, Mother? Oh, it's beautiful. So classy. Like an opera house. (cork pops) (gasps) Oh. (laughs) (sighs) A chandelier. Like home. (chuckles) (gasps) Someone left a scarf. It's beautiful with my dress. (chuckles) Finders keepers. And now you are in charge of this club? (thunder rumbling softly) Spoiled my surprise. No. Oh, no, no, liebchen. No, don't be angry. No. Such good news. My boy has a club. Will have a club. There's still a few loose ends to tie up, but... soon it will be mine. (laughs) I am so proud of you... I could spit. (both laugh) Bullock : Listen, Jim, there's something I got to tell you. A few years ago, Flass and his people started busting drug dealers, taking over their stash houses, running them themselves. Now? You tell me this now? Look, I respond to crises as they arise. I'm not a forward planner like you. I didn't tell you then because I didn't want to get you all riled you up, but I'm telling you now because I want you to stop. Flass is protected. By who? Serious people. Really high up. Big money. For all I know, the commissioner gets a piece, too. You mess with Flass, you can forget going back to Arkham. These guys do not play. These stash houses- think you can get me a location on them? Did you not hear a word I just said? The stash houses could give us evidence linking Flass to Littlefield's murder. We nail him for Littlefield, we can nail him for Winkler. I can't let it be, Harvey. You should know that by now. Mick, it's Harv. You know that thing you and Donnie were working on? The Flass thing? I need your help. Prime spot for a stash house. Yeah. Gordon : Delaware, hand over the boxes. You don't learn, do you? Get out of my face. Hey. Hey! No need to rough each other up, gentlemen. I got a warrant. Giving us the legal right to search and seizure. Seems this warehouse was being used as a home base by the Uptown Assassins. You expect us to believe you got a signed warrant to clear your own stash house? On the commissioner's request. Signed by Judge Bam-Bam. Guess you don't have a leg to stand on... homicide. So what's our next step? Next step? We got nothing to tie Flass to the drugs or the murders. Murder. Just one. Internal Affairs just ruled Winkler's death as a suicide. They're releasing the body to his wife. Leon was so very happy. (crying): This just can't be right. Can't be... A suicide? He stabbed himself in the back with an ice pick? That's absurd! A ruling this quick means the commissioner was involved. Screw the commissioner. Going forward with this puts all of our jobs at risk. Look, I want to help you, Jim. There are people here in GCPD who want to help you. So why don't they? They have. I have. And we learned the hard way. With men like Flass, you need more than words. You need results. And that's not gonna happen this time around. So do us all a favor and move on to the next vic. Please. (sobbing softly) Where you going? Back in an hour. 
 
 Listen to this. This is classic. Stop it. Come on. Hey. Come on. "Dear Miss Kringle, your eyes are as green as a meadow. Your smile is as bright as the sun. Your skin is as white as a snowflake. It seems like your life is fun." (laughter) Really? Oh, hey! It's the writer himself. Whew. (laughter) It's a real piece of work you got there, perv. I wouldn't quit your day job if I were you. Roger, dodger. Roger, dodger? Stop it. (chuckles) What a creep. (laughter) One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One... (laughs) Now... now you are getting it. You are so graceful for such a big man. Isn't he graceful, Oswald? Yes, Mother. Jim. Welcome. Come in. Another handsome man at the party. I am so lucky. This is Jim Gordon, the detective friend I was telling you about. Oh. So nice to meet a friend of Oswald's. I am Gertrud Kapelput. Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Kapelput. Mmm. (chuckles) Mother, Jim and I have very important business. No. Oh, sad. Oh, how sad. (chuckles) A little soon to be celebrating, don't you think? Well, don't just stand there. Sit. This won't take long. I insist. Sit. (Gertrud laughing, gentle music playing) (chuckles) I'm so very glad you called, Jim Gordon. It's been far too long since we've seen each other. I was beginning to think you'd rgotten about me. I need a favor. Do you know anything about a narcotics detective by the name of Arnold Flass? I've heard the name. I'm investigating him and his crew for murder, but I've hit a wall. He's too well-connected. I figured since Maroni runs the drug trade, maybe you could find somebody with the goods on Flass? But... Shh. Say no more. Favor is done. I'll make some calls. And what do I owe you in return? Friends don't owe friends, silly. They just do favors because they want to. (chuckles): Because they're friends. Nobody gets hurt. Of course. No one gets hurt. Champagne. (chuckles) (laughing) (guttural gasping) Zsasz : Oh, dear me. What happened here? Call Falcone. No kidding. (laughs) Thank you. Thank you, boys. Lovely. (music stops) No. I-I am dancing still. Shh. You may go. Oh, why you make them go? Gabe, on your way to help my dear friend Jim, could you be a gentleman and take Mother home? Sure thing, boss. Come on, Mrs. K. A palace. My boy has a palace. Such a good boy. Don't worry. I will be back. (laughs) (laughs) ♪ ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, friends, celebrities from around the world, my name is Oswald Cobblepot. (chuckles) Here we are at last. It is with deep and sincere pleasure that I bid you welcome to the official grand opening of my newest night spot, the... (clapping) (microphone feedback squeals) Not bad. I do believe you need to project more. Just to create a bit more excitement for the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Fish Mooney's! Like that. What kind of weirdo plays chess with himself? Don't you have a butler to do that kind of stuff with you? He's making lunch. I got your message. I'm glad you're safe. Alfred made me go out of town. Switzerland. We have a house there. Chalet, I guess. A chalet? It's basically a house. Why did you want to see me? We're friends, aren't we? You've been driving around looking for me, sending messages. What's up? I got you a present. It looks like the town we stayed in. Whoa. Thank you. Also, I wanted to know if, um... if you wanted to stay here in my house. Why? I figure we can help each other out. You can help me find the man who killed my parents, and I can give you a better place to live. What's better about it? Listen kid... chill. I came here to tell you to stop hassling me. Hassling you? Yeah. You're beginning to bug me. I thought we were friends. Listen, I lied. I... didn't see who killed your parents. I didn't see his face. I don't understand. I lied so I wouldn't get locked up in juvie. So it's no use buying me presents or sending me messages or trying to hang out. There's no point because I can't help you. (window closes) Pinky Littlefield was light two weeks running. If you don't pay up, there's consequences. Flass killed him to send a message. But please, please! I swear that's all I know. You sure? I swear, man, I swear! I believe you. (gasping) But I think I'll need something a bit more tangible. No, no, no! Please, no! No! No! Please, no! I swear, man! I swear! (panting) How are you liking show business now? Please, Miss Mooney. You're making a mistake. (grunting) I I beg of you, let me speak. I know we've had our differences. Hmm. We could combine our forces. Think how'd we fool everyone. Me... work with you? I found you. I made you. When you walked in here, you were a sad little wannabe. Remember that, Butch? You were so afraid. Shook like a leaf in fall. You're a servant. An umbrella boy. You're... a nobody. This nobody still outfoxed you at every turn. I was working for Falcone the whole time! And you didn't have the sense to see it! (gunshot) Zsasz : Hello. Seems like Mooney's is the place to be today. (grunts) Gilzean : Come on, come on! No! Come on! (laughing) Go, go, go! Here. (grunts loudly) You got to go! I'll slow them down. No, no! Go! Hello again. (yells) (groans) Where is she? (laughs quietly) What do you think, girls? Should we kill him... or should we take him home to play with? (clears throat) Mr. Nygma? Miss Kringle. Am I interrupting? Yes. I'm surgically removing the onions from my takeout, so if you don't mind... Mr. Nygma, I owe you an apology. I didn't give Arnold the card. He found it in my desk. He has a strange sense of humor. I thought your card was... very... um... thoughtful. I guess. Anyway, I'm sorry. Miss Kringle, would you... No, no, no, no, no. Please, don't say anything else. Just, please. There's hope. What's this? Murder weapon and a tape of Delaware rolling on Flass. Smart cookie, that one. Flass gave him the ice pick to throw away. Delaware kept it in case he had to cover his own ass. Thank you. You're welcome. (quiet chatter, laughter) (sobbing softly) Master Bruce? She was lying. Oh... I see. Shall I get a broom, then? Or would you rather continue crying over the shattered fragments of your... young dreams? Yes, Alfred. A broom. Very good, Master Bruce. I'll find other leads. No doubt. I knew she was a wrong 'un. Arnold Flass. You're under arrest for the murder of Leon Winkler. Keep walking, mutt. You got nothing. (quiet chatter, laughter) (chatter stops) That's 20 years upstate right there. Delaware gave you up. Jimbo... you really think these guys are gonna let you arrest me? Hmm? These are my friends. This is my house. This is not your house. You're a drug dealer and a murderer. You don't belong here. You don't deserve the badge. (chuckles) You believe this crap? How long you been here? A few months? Why don't you come preach to me in five years? He murdered Leon Winkler, an innocent man who trusted us! Who trusted this. (officers murmuring) Enough to step forward and help us solve a case. A man who died so Detective Flass could protect himself. I.A. ruled it a suicide. I'm arresting this man. Get real, dumb-ass. I'm protected. Gordon : You can help me or you can try and stop me. Either way, I'm doing my duty. Hey, back off, all right?! I'm protected! Get out of here. Shut up, Flass. Arnold Flass, you're under arrest for murder. The hell do you think you're doing? Are you crazy? Read him his rights. (handcuffs clicking) You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you... You can't keep me in here! You know how many people I got? (Flass continues shouting) Thanks, Cap. (ship horn blowing in distance) Here. (shivers) So what's the plan? I'm gonna leave town, lay low for a while. Then I'm gonna come back and kill Penguin when the time is right. Listen, you know I have your best interests at heart. Don't come back. No. You will see me again. And in the meantime, do me a favor. Find Butch. And if he's alive, help him. I will. See you soon. Be good. Always. ♪ ♪ (bird caws) Good night. Night, Detective. Yo. That big guy visit you? Give you the package I sent? Yeah. Thanks. That was, uh... Yo, this... so this means we're even? I ratted out Flass like you wanted. So now you back off, right? Nothing more is gonna happen to my wife? She's safe? My family's safe? I don't understand what you're talking about. Okay, okay, no worries. Look, never mind I pressed. I won't say nothing to no one. I'll-I'll pretend this conversation never happened. Okay? Just... keep my wife and kids out of it. I'm-I'm begging you. (sniffles) Please. Please! Please!
