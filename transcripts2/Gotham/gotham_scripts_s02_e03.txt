 Previously on  Gotham... 
 Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor. 
 (man screaming) 
 Essen :  Six criminally insane inmates busted out of Arkham Asylum. 
 (cheerleaders screaming) 
 Gordon :  They want mass panic. 
 (cheerleaders screaming) 
 Barbara : Hello, Jim. 
 How do I look? 
 Gordon : Barbara! 
 Yo, Commish. 
 Yeah. 
 (laughs) 
 Gordon : Don't move! 
 (Aaron yells) 
 Barbara :  You should probably get back to work. 
 Who knows what went wrong while you were gone? (gasps) 
 (weakly): It's a new day, Jim. 
 (screaming) 
 (roans) 
 (coughs) 
 Jerome Valeska. 
 The attack on the GCPD. 
 Someone on the streets is talking. 
 Somebody knows something. 
 Valeska has red hair, crazy laugh. 
 Might be rolling with a blonde number. 
 I-I don't know anything. 
 Honest! 
 You believe him? 
 Nope. 
 Me neither. 
 It's the truth! But, hey, I-I can help you guys, you know, spread the word and stuff. 
 Valeska killed a friend of ours. 
 Anybody hides him, anybody protects him, they go down, too, you got it? 
 Now spread the word. 
 Barbara : Sneaking out? 
 Just like a guy. 
 There are loose ends that need tying. 
 Need this? 
 Bring back bagels. 
 Theo : No need for that. 
 I thought Ms. Kean and I could have a little chat. 
 Good morning. 
 Jerome is waiting outside. 
 Try and keep him focused. 
 (chuckles softly) 
 You be nice. 
 You two seem to be getting along. 
 I'm so glad. 
 She needs a friend. 
 My sister is a very special person. 
 She seems so strong, but yet she's quite fragile. 
 Sugar? 
 Sure. 
 You acquitted yourself very well at the adventure at the GCPD. 
 Jim Gordon escaped the carnage unscathed. 
 Top marks. 
 Thank you. 
 Did you know my family built this city? 
 We carved the bedrock upon which it stands, yet there is not a bridge, an alley, a ditch that carries our name. 
 My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased, and I am here to punish those who wronged us and reclaim what is ours. 
 Strawberry? 
 I didn't ask. 
 So you're gonna take over Gotham by unleashing a bunch of loonies. Awesome plan. 
 That's only part one. 
 So what's the second part? 
 Oh, you're gonna love it. 
 There's a starring role for you. 
 You'll be famous and powerful, and your fondest dream will come true. 
 You know my dreams, do you? 
 When Jim Gordon has outlived his usefulness, I'm gonna help you destroy him. 
 Not kill him. 
 Destroy him. 
 Body and soul. 
 (gunfire, people screaming) 
 Bang. 
 (cackling) 
 Shocking images. Gotham is on high alert today after... 
 Bullock : Look, I'm just saying, I'll chuck mopes out of windows until the cows come home, but at some point, we got to go see Penguin. 
 Why would he break Jerome out of Arkham or attack the GCPD. 
 He wouldn't, but that weasel's running things now. 
 If there's chatter, he'd know it. 
 I'll think about it. 
 Jim... 
 I'll think about it! 
 Alvarez, where are you with Jerome's circus contacts? 
 Circus is upstate. I'm just waiting... 
 Follow up. 
 His father's probably with him. He covered for him once before. 
 He might have some information. 
 Do it. Yo, Detective! 
 Which escapee are you tracking? 
 Helzinger. 
 No one's seen him. 
 He's six-seven, 275, with the mind of a five-year-old. 
 Somebody's seen him. 
 Hey! 
 What are you doing? 
 That stays up until we have her killer in custody. 
 You understand? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Sarah Essen and nine of your brothers were killed in this house. 
 In our house! 
 Their murderer stood right there, and he laughed at us. 
 Never forget that. 
 What?! 
 Thompkins : So how are you? 
 Gordon : I'm fine. 
 Really? 
 Look, I know Essen was your friend. 
 Lee, whatever you're about to say, I know it's coming from a good place, but I can't hear it right now. 
 So, the Gotham Children's Hospital gala is tonight, which I helped organize. 
 I can't. 
 You can't go? 
 No. 
 Even though a few hours away from all of this might actually help? 
 Lee. 
 Okay. I just have to tell you something, because if I don't and you find out, you're gonna be pissed. 
 There's gonna be a magician. 
 (chuckling) 
 Yeah. Right. 
 Stop beating yourself up. 
 I'm trying. 
 I know you are. 
 I should have been here. I wasn't. 
 Stop it. 
 Kiss me. 
 Kiss me. 
 (sighs) 
 Better? 
 (clears throat) 
 Not to interrupt your weirdly timed make-out session, but Alvarez got in touch with the circus manager. 
 The blind fortune teller, Jerome's dad, bailed on him, stayed in town. 
 Got an address. 
 I'll call you. 
 Okay. 
 Who's there? 
 I know someone's there. 
 (grunting softly) 
 Hi-ya, Pops. 
 Long time... no see. 
 (laughing) 
 Jerome : So, how you doing? 
 Ah, the silent treatment, eh? 
 Here, I'll tell you a story. 
 Hmm. Oh. 
 You remember Kansas City, Dad? 
 The circus went through town every spring right around my birthday. 
 There was this guy. 
 Him and my mom used to drink and fornicate and beat the crap out of me. 
 They'd make a whole night out of it. 
 And I remember one time... it was my ninth birthday... him and my mom had just finished round one of boozing, boning, beating up Jerome, and were deciding to take a little break. 
 Anyway... 
 Mm. 
 I was outside the trailer, and you were there. 
 And you said, "Why are you crying, Jerome?" 
 "It's my birthday. (sobs softly) And my mom and the snake guy are beating me." then you said, "This world doesn't care about you or anyone else, Jerome. 
 Better to realize that now." 
 And that was it. 
 You see, there's this guy, Dad. 
 He believes in me. 
 He thinks I'm gonna be a star. 
 And, tonight, all of Gotham will see that, too. 
 Except for you. 
 'Cause you'll be, you know, dead. 
 Jerome... 
 Is this the part where you say how sorry you are? Hmm? 
 How you should have believed in me, how it's not too late to start again? 
 News flash, Dad: it's too late. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 No. 
 I'm pretty sure I do. 
 I was a bad father, but I did love you. 
 To kill me for that... 
 (cackling) 
 That's not why I'm gonna kill you. 
 Plans to Arkham Asylum. 
 Look at these. 
 Ah. 
 Letters between you and your troubled son. 
 Innocent at first glance, but Detective Gordon... you remember him, right?... he'll feel little bumps. 
 A secret message written in Braille between you and your son, discussing my escape. 
 Finally, the knockout gas used to disable the orderlies. 
 'Cause, you see, Dad, this guy I was telling you about, he's the one who broke me out of Arkham. 
 He doesn't want anyone to know about that. 
 Obviously. So... the police will find these letters, mmm, and they'll think, "The blind old fool really loved his son. 
 What a wonderful father." Oh. 
 There won't be a dry eye in the house. 
 They'll never believe it. 
 Ah, sure, they will. Cops are dumb. 
 There's nothing to eat in this dump. 
 Finish up and let's go. 
 Jerome : Sorry you're gonna miss my big night, Dad. 
 But, hey, you're psychic. 
 So, tell me, do I kill? 
 You.. 
 Will be a curse upon Gotham. 
 Children will wake from sleeps screaming at the thought of you. 
 Your legacy will be death and madness. 
 Ha, ha, ha. 
 Well... say hi to Mom for me. 
 (knocking) 
 Gordon : GCPD! 
 GCPD! 
 Mr. Cicero, it's Detective Gordon. 
 We need to speak with you about your son. 
 Mr. Cicero? 
 (muffled scream) 
 Mr. Cicero?! 
 Harvey, window! 
 (gas hissing) 
 Harvey? 
 (coughing) 
 (ears ringing, heart beating) 
 (whistling a tune) 
 Jerome : Detective Gordon. 
 Old pal. 
 That gas sure packs a wallop, huh? 
 (grunts) 
 That's cute. 
 (choking) 
 I'm sensing anger. 
 You killed Sarah Essen. 
 Now I'm gonna kill you. 
 (chuckling) 
 Don't shoot him. 
 How about a little flesh wound? 
 No, no. 
 My dibs. 
 ("Dirty Boogie" by the Brian Setzer Orchestra playing) 
 (lively chatter) 
 This is a waste of time. 
 We had a deal, didn't we, Master Bruce. 
 Part of which was you resume your normal lifestyle. 
 Your parents were both patrons to the Children's Hospital. 
 Therefore, it makes you a patron. 
 Besides... there's gonna be a magician. 
 And you like magicians, don't you? 
 No, I don't. 
 I hate magicians. 
 You know what I said about being normal? 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm Lee Thompkins. 
 I work with James Gordon. 
 He's mentioned you, and I saw you and thought... 
 Of course. It's very nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. This is my guardian, Alfred Pennyworth. 
 It's an absolute pleasure. 
 Thank you. How is Detective Gordon doing since the attack on the precinct? 
 I was thinking I should call him. 
 He'd appreciate that. 
 ♪ Dirty boogie... ♪ 
 Can I get you something to drink? 
 Uh, just water. Thank you. 
 ♪ It's the dirty boogie for me... ♪ 
 So... 
 ♪  Dirty boogie...   ♪ 
 I hear there's gonna be a magician. 
 ♪ Hey, you all ♪ 
♪  Dirty boogie  ♪

 Hello, Selina. 
 Hey. 
 I-I didn't expect to see you here. 
 Well, you want to steal stuff, it helps to go where the rich people are. 
 You do know this is a benefit for Children's Hospital? 
 So? 
 So these people are here for a good cause. 
 Me eating is a good cause. 
 Besides, didn't I steal something for you, once? 
 Selina, that was different. 
 Right. 
 ♪ Scream and shout... ♪ 
 How'd that go? 
 You get into that guy's safe? 
 Yes. 
 Though things didn't turn out quite like I planned. 
 A lot's happened since then. 
 Alfred says there's gonna be a magician. 
 I'm working. 
 And I hate magicians. 
 See you around, Bruce. 
 So you want to share your plan? 
 Remember I told you I could divine the thing a person truly wants? 
 What Gotham wants is a hero. 
 And tonight. 
 I'm going to give them one. 
 Shall we? 
 Jerome and Tabby went on ahead. 
 Great cape. 
 Thank you for filling in on such short notice. 
 But how did you hear our magician dropped out, Mr... ? 
 Rodolfo. 
 Well, you know, magic. 
 (both chuckle) 
 Oh, I won't be needing that. 
 (muffled grunting) 
 Man : Come on. 
 I'm sorry, but really, there is no mystery. 
 Tabitha, have you met Deputy Mayor Kane? 
 Harrison, this is my Tabitha. 
 Ah, nice to meet you. 
 Uh, and could you please tell your brother that when a handsome billionaire appears out of nowhere, people get curious. 
 Where'd he come from? 
 How'd he make his money? 
 Who's he dating? 
 My wife would kill me if I don't get something... a-a tidbit. 
 He's a monster in the sack. 
 Do you have any news of Mayor James? 
 No. 
 No, it's a real mystery. 
 We don't know where he is. 
 How intriguing. 
 Harrison, would you mind? A little family business. 
 Of course. Miss Galavant. 
 Everything's ready. 
 See you at home. 
 So, uh, how do you go from being in the Royal Marines to a butler? 
 Well, it's a bit tedious, really, after a while. 
 You know, parachuting into one global hot spot another. 
 Warlords putting ridiculous bounties on your head. 
 Gets a bit boring, really. 
 You have amazing stories. 
 Yeah, well, you know, one or two. 
 You know, I don't really get nights off, but if ever you'd like to pop by Wayne Manor for dinner one evening, I... 
 Oh, that's very kind of you Mr. Pennyworth, but... 
 No. 
 Alfred. Please. Alfred. 
 Alfred. That's very kind of you, but... 
 Now, having said that, I don't see why I can't take a night off, and I... I happen to know the head chef at Chez Parnes. 
 Well, I-I'm afraid I... 
 Did you say Chez Parnes? 
 I've been trying to eat there for quite some time. 
 You have the most beautiful eyes. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Okay, well, thank you, but, uh... 
 Alfred, I'd like to leave. 
 Yeah, um... 
 What about Dr. Thompkins' water? 
 And, of course, you're gonna miss the magician. 
 Sorry, I must have forgotten your water. 
 Alfred, I still want to leave. 
 Are you not feeling well? 
 Oh, n-no, he's-he's absolutely fine. He's fine. 
 Why don't you just pop off to the bar, Master Bruce, and... 
 (quietly): Show's about to start. 
 Is it time? 
 I roped myself into MC duties for the night. 
 I hope you'll stay for the show. 
 I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
 What? 
 (music ends, applause) 
 Good evening. 
 I'm Dr. Lee Thompkins. 
 For the past five years, I've had the honor of being part of the Children's Hospital. 
 Thank you for your support. 
 And thank you so much for coming out tonight. 
 Over the years, we've had magicians come and entertain our children. 
 And so tonight, we have one of the magicians here for you. 
 Without further ado, please allow me to present to you the Great Rodolfo. 
 (music playing, applause) 
 (gasps) 
 (yawns) 
 (laughter) 
 Ha! 
 Greetings, ladies and germs! 
 I am indeed the Great Rodolfo. 
 Please ogle my lovely assistant. 
 Ooh! 
 (laughs) 
 (drumroll) 
 For my first act, I'll require a volunteer. 
 Let me see. 
 Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck... goose! 
 Go on, Master Bruce. 
 Be a sport. 
 Don't keep the lady waiting. 
 Fine. 
 (applause) 
 Hello, young man. 
 Does this handsome gentleman have a name? 
 Bruce. 
 Bruce! 
 Well, Bruce, this won't hurt a bit. 
 Is there a doctor in the house? 
 (laughter) 
 Just wait! Wait! 
 Wait one second! 
 Go home. 
 I'm fine. 
 You've been running this since last night, and you got a face full of that gas. Go home. 
 You going home? 
 (sighs) 
 I didn't think so. 
 (groans): Oh. 
 Maybe I will go get some sleep. 
 Yeah? Good idea. 
 But we got somewhere, right? 
 At least now we know who broke Jerome out of Arkham. 
 Yeah. Crazy old blind man that lived alone. 
 The  clever  crazy old blind man. 
 If his father broke him out, why'd Jerome kill him, huh? 
 He was probably playing this maniac shtick since you sent him away. 
 He was just a kid. 
 Every evil b*st*rd in the world was just a kid once. 
 Yeah. 
 But I don't think it was his father that broke him out. 
 (chuckles): Well, cool. 
 Back to square one. 
 All right, I will go and get some sleep. 
 For the record, I knew Essen a hell of a lot longer than you. 
 She saved my ass hundreds of times. 
 You really should go home. 
 First thing tomorrow, we'll go see Penguin. 
 You're right. 
 He's got his ears on the street. 
 Jim. 
 Never mind. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 
 
 
 (fanfare plays, laughter, applause) 
 Give 'em a wave. 
 (laughs) 
 (rim shot) 
 (applause) 
 Some people say Bruce has a split personality. 
 (laughter) 
 Very good, Master Bruce. 
 (blows kiss) 
 (microphone feedback hums) 
 For my next illusion, I'd like to call to the stage esteemed Deputy Mayor Harrison Kane. 
 Is there something familiar to you about those two? 
 Oh, my God. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Lee, I was just... 
 Jim, it's Barbara. 
 She's here. And-and I think maybe Rome... 
 (muffled groan) 
 By the way, nobody here... is getting out alive. 
 (laughter) 
 (crowd gasps) 
 (groans) 
 (crowd murmuring, screaming) 
 (Jerome cackling) 
 Right, Master Bruce, time to leave. 
 Ta-da! 
 (screaming continues) 
 (laughing) 
 (laughing) 
 Selina! 
 Bruce! 
 (Jerome cackling) 
 (panicked chatter, screaming) 
 (Jerome continues cackling) 
 (tires screeching) 
 (sirens wailing) 
 You! What's going on? 
 Hostage situation. 
 The magician just killed the Deputy Mayor. 
 It's Jerome Valeska, the man that killed Commissioner Essen. 
 Who's in charge here? 
 I guess you are. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Lee. 
 Thank God. I've been trying to... 
 Jerome : Sorry, Jimbo. It's just little old me. 
 Jerome. 
 Are you outside? 
 (gasps) You are, aren't you? 
 (laughs): Oh, goody! 
 I swear to God, if you've hurt her... 
 Breathe, James. 
 I haven't touched a hair on your girlfriend's pretty head. 
 See for yourself. 
 (over speakers): This is live television after all. 
 (Jerome laughs) 
 (Jerome laughing) 
 The feed just came back. 
 (Jerome imitates explosion, laughs) 
 You son of a bitch. 
 True, but not the point. 
 Hey, let's talk about what I want. 
 Excuse me. (clears throat) 
 $47 million, a helicopter, obviously, the dry cleaning I left at Mr. Chang's... be careful, the man is a crook... and, mm, I don't know, a pony. 
 (laughs) Uh... 
 You got ten minutes, or I start killing people. 
 Remember, this is being broadcast to every home in Gotham, so, you know, don't let people die. Bye. 
 (cackling) 
 (cackling continues) 
 I think that went well. 
 Theo : Enough! 
 You need to pack up your pathetic little sideshow and leave. 
 Is that right? 
 It may be presumptuous to speak for all the citizens of Gotham. 
 But we are sick of you! 
 You're a small, vicious man with a pathetic need for attention. 
 Enough, man. 
 For God's sakes, enough. 
 I'm curious what your leverage is here, Mr... ? 
 Theo Galavan. 
 Well, Mr. Theo Galavan, if you don't sit down, uh, I'm going to shoot you. 
 In the face. 
 I know there is some human decency left in you. 
 If you need to take a hostage, take me. 
 But let these people go home to their families, to their children. 
 (crowd gasps) 
 Barbara : Boring. 
 Jerome : Right? 
 Get your men. We're going in. 
 I used this to sneak into the party. 
 We're lucky those dummies didn't know about it. 
 Wait. 
 We're almost outside. 
 Wait. I have to go back. 
 Are you crazy? That guy was killing people! 
 Yes, and Alfred's back there. 
 I'm not going back. 
 I don't expect you to. 
 Selina... 
 I miss you. 
 I just wanted to say that. 
 (sirens wailing, helicopter whirring) 
 You're refusing a direct order? I could have your stripes. 
 That maniac killed the commissioner. 
 Not my men. We're not equipped for this. 
 Fine. I'll go it alone. 
 (sighs) 
 Oh. 
 Hold very still. 
 (breathes slowly) 
 Oh. 
 I can't look. 
 Someone tell me how it turns out. 
 (toy gun squeaks, crowd gasps) 
 (laughs) 
 Damn! 
 Turn around. 
 (crowd gasps, Barbara whoops) 
 Well, clap! 
 (applause) 
 (laughs) Ooh! 
 So, Lee, how's Jim doing? 
 I hope he's not blaming himself for this whole Essen being killed thing. 
 You are one crazy bitch. 
 So rude. 
 You know, I'm gonna... I'm gonna make a prediction. 
 (grunts): Ow! 
 Within a year, Jim and I will be back together. 
 (giggles) 
 Want to know why? 
 Because we're both the same. 
 We both have a dark side. 
 And one day, we will tell our grandchildren about how this man-eating harpy almost tore us apart! 
 But in the end, love conquered all. (giggles) 
 You... 
 I'm sorry. What's that? 
 (grunts) 
 Hasn't been ten minutes. I need to buy you a watch. 
 (crowd gasps) 
 Well... 
 I think it's time for tonight's first official victim, you all know and love, poor rich boy, parents murdered in an alley, and my favorite volunteer. 
 Where is... Bruce Wayne?! 
 You know I'm an orphan, too, Bruce I killed my parents though. 
 Where are you hiding? 
 Bruce! 
 Where are you, buddy? 
 Kill his butler. 
 Man : Come on, move it, butler. 
 (gun clicks) 
 Jerome : Alright. 
 Last chance, Bruce, but it's about to get very butler brain out here. 
 D-Detective Gordon. 
 He's going to kill Alfred. I have to help him. 
 (singsongy): Brucey! 
 No. It's you he wants. 
 Bruce, just wants you. 
 I will not let him hurt Alfred. 
 Jerome : I'm bored. 
 Shoot the butler. 
 Stop! 
 (crowd gasps) 
 (laughs) 
 What the bloody hell are you doing, Bruce? 
 There's a gun in my jacket. 
 Detective Gordon's behind the curtain. 
 (crowd gasps, gun clicks) 
 Let gets this started, huh? 
 You, check behind the curtain; make sure no one's playing silly buggers. (laughs) 
 (crowd screaming) 
 Drop the knife! 
 (cackling) 
 I don't have a clean shot! 
 Stay calm, Bruce. 
 (laughs) 
 Seems like we got ourselves a pickle. 
 What do you say, Brucey boy? 
 Want to boost our ratings, huh? 
 (laughing) 
 Smile. (laughing) 
 Theo : I said, enough! 
 (crowd screaming) 
 I know, I know. 
 (gasping weakly) 
 This is not what we rehearsed. 
 I'm so sorry, Jerome. 
 You have real talent. 
 But now, you see, the plot thickens. 
 Enter the hero. 
 (straining): You said... 
 I was gonna be... 
 (sighs) 
 Jim! 
 Stop her! 
 (crowd gasps) 
 A pony. (laughs) Uh... 
 See, someone like that has no interest in building things. 
 He's not part of a tradition. 
 Hmm? 
 Chaos sake. 
 (Jerome cackling over TV) 
 Perhaps I could use a new laugh. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Bullock (chuckles) : Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! 
 Huh? 
 Wow. 
 Dude! 
 Color me impressed. 
 You know, if I close my eyes, still see you holding Fish's umbrella. 
 "Yes, Ms. Mooney. No, Ms. Mooney. Whatever you say, Ms. Mooney. That wig looks great on you, Ms. Mooney." 
 Seriously, the worm has turned. 
 Detective Bullock. 
 I heard you rejoined the force. 
 I am so happy. 
 But aren't you missing all of the excitement? 
 Yeah, I got the word too late. 
 Besides, I want to talk to you. 
 Of course. 
 Always happy to help. 
 See, there's talk on the street that Jim Gordon did a favor for you, collected a debt and the guy ended up dead. 
 (laughs) 
 Rumors. 
 (scoffs) 
 (laughs): Rumors. 
 Huh. 
 Well, then again, where there's smoke... 
 Jim shouldn't worry about that. 
 He and I are fends. 
 Well, see, that's the problem, Oswald; I think he is worried. 
 Because something happened today, and you were the obvious person to come to. 
 And I sensed Jim was a little reluctant to come down here. 
 Like I said, he shouldn't worry. 
 As long as you two remain friends. 
 Exactly. 
 Yeah. 
 I got half a mind to take you outside and beat you senseless with a garbage can. 
 (guns clicking) 
 Maybe some other time. 
 Call yourself whatever you want, man! 
 The King of Gotham. 
 But, to me, you'll always that little umbrella boy. 
 And if you come after Jim Gordon, you got to come after me. 
 And I still owe you for Fish. 
 But, seriously, this place is amazing. 
 (kisses) 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Get me another drink! 
 You were very brave. 
 You helped save the lives of everyone in here. 
 Your parents, they would've been proud. 
 Alfred : That they would've been. 
 They also would've given me the sack if I let you do something so idiotic. 
 It was all of us. 
 We were a team. 
 Yeah. I guess we were. 
 Is he okay? 
 Fine. Though I'd still like him to get checked out at the hospital. 
 Barbara gave him quite a knock. 
 Any word on her? 
 No, she went through a trapdoor in the stage. 
 They must have always been planning to use that as their exit. 
 Don't worry. We'll find her. 
 Uh, Mr. Galavan, sir. 
 Alfred Pennyworth. 
 I'd just like to thank you for saving young Master Wayne's life. 
 Oh. 
 If there's anything I can ever do for you, sir... 
 Or I. 
 I really just did what any citizen of Gotham would have done. 
 I wish that were true. 
 Jim Gordon. 
 Theo. 
 Well, if you ever need anything, please, call. 
 We're all in this together, right? 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Right, well, I suppose I better be getting this young man home. 
 It's been much more of an exciting evening than originally planned. 
 I never did like magicians. 
 (chuckles) 
 Good night. 
 It was very nice meeting you, Dr. Thompkins. 
 And you, Bruce. 
 Good night's sleep, you'll be right as roses. 
 I do hope we get to see you again soon. 
 Thank you. 
 Alfred. 
 Sure you're okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Kiss me? 
 Jim... 
 Kiss me. 
 Oh, bugger. 
 Alfred. 
 You knew, didn't you?

 Reporter : Despite the presence of the GCPD, it was billionaire Theo Galavan... newly arrived in Gotham but already making his name... who stood up to the escaped lunatic.

 Your legacy will be death and madness.
