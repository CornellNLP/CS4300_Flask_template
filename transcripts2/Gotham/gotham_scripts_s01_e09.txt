 Previously on Gotham... 
 Killing Falcone would only create chaos. 
 I need to siphon his strength. So, when the time is right, taking over his organization would be like slipping on a glove. 
 I'm so angry all the time. Will that ever go away? 
 Alfred, can you teach me how to fight? 
 You've been through a lot. 
 I'm scared, Jim. 
 Everywhere I go,  I can feel that monster, Zsasz. 
 Alvarez : Gordon, some unis brought in a perp. Claims to know you. Hey, Detective. Miss me? Barbara? Whoa. Sweet crib. You must be one rich cop. It's my girlfriend's place. Where is she? I don't know. Barbara? So... what? I get to stay here alone? I'm hungry. Barbara : Dear Jim, I thought I could be strong and brave for you, but I can't. Every place I go, I see Falcone and Zsasz. I'm nervous and needy and screwed up, and I know that's not what you need or want, so I'm going away for a while, to get myself together. (cell phone ringing) This is Gordon. Uh... uh, right. Yeah. We're in the penthouse. Come on up. Sounds like your girlfriend's not coming back, huh? Why's she worried about Falcone? None of your business. So what happens now? You gonna get the charges against me dropped? I will, but you're my only witness to the Wayne murders. You gonna cuff me to a drainpipe again? No, I'm not gonna hold you against your will. GCPD, juvie... you'd just break out. So I do get to stay here. No, I have someplace else in mind. (knocking on door) That's the sketch artist. I need you to describe the man who shot the Waynes. Wait, where am I going to stay? Wayne Manor. Do not speak to the inmate. Do not touch the inmate unless in the service of your job. Do not accept anything from the inmate under any circumstances. Who is this guy, anyway? Name's Ian Hargrove, some genius bomb maker. Took out over a dozen buildings in and around Gotham. He's the one that blew up the commissary last month? Yeah, and he did it with match shavings and apple cider vinegar. So no mistakes today, got it? Put your hands up. (latch slides, clicks) She said this is the man who killed your parents. She said she saw his face. Do you recognize him, Bruce? No. What's her name? Selina Kyle. Do you believe her? Yes, I do. So, she saw... everything? And you want her to live here with us, do you? A common street criminal. She's hardly older than Bruce. She's just a kid who's seen too much. This is for her safety. GCPD is full of moles... Right, and how long would you have us put her up, then? I don't know. No. The answer is no. Her being here will put Master Bruce in great danger. Alfred. She is the witness to a murder, Master Bruce. You do understand that, don't you? She's also the best chance we have of finding who killed my parents. Isn't she? Yes, she is. Then she can stay. As long as it takes. I've made my decision. Yes, Master Bruce. Look, I know this is a lot. But I'm doing everything I can. Montoya and Allen and I are meeting with an ADA they trust this afternoon. Oh... a trustworthy lawyer. In Gotham. Look, if we find this guy, we'll need her. She'll have to testify. Go before a judge. It won't be easy. Witnesses back out all the time. The ones that stick it out do so because they care about the victims. We'll do our best to be nice to her, then, won't we? It's from the Chinese Ming dynasty. Five... 500 years old. You can get one just like it for five bucks, in Chinatown. I'm Bruce Wayne. Selina Kyle. People call me Cat. Nice to meet you, Cat. What are you doing? Nothing. What's in your hand? I said, what's in... What the hell...? (tires screeching, horn honking) Hargrove! Ian Hargrove, time to go. Man : Kid, you screwed up, big-time. But you're still young, you deserve a second chance. So I have a bet for you. You call heads or tails. You lose, you go to jail. You win, we let you go. Bet. Hold on. There's a catch. You have to make a promise to God right now. If you win, you're gonna take this as a sign from him telling you that you need to go back to school and get your life straight. Can you promise that? Do you promise that? Yes, sir. Okay then. Call. Heads. Walk away, kid. Somebody up there loves you. Hey, Harvey. Go. Remember your promise. Jim Gordon, GCPD. I hear good things about you, counselor. Harvey Dent, likewise about you, detective. That was some trick with the coin. What if the kid guesses wrong? You gonna send him to jail? Teenagers, they nearly always call heads. I don't know why. Two-headed coin. Whatever works, right? Dent : So who is he, Jim? Who really killed the Waynes? This is what we have. No I.D. But this is from an eyewitness? That you have in safe custody. It's not nearly enough to go to the law with. Even if we had I.D. on this guy, it's the people who hired him we really want. I agree. Your eyewitness is useless in a courtroom. But the idea of your witness could be immensely valuable. Ever hear the name Dick Lovecraft? Sure. Billionaire. Property, construction, chemicals. And as corrupt as they come. Falcone, Maroni, even Wayne Enterprises, Lovecraft has dealings with all of them. Since the Waynes' deaths, he's doubled his fortune. Including a huge piece of the Arkham deal. Dent : Lovecraft had a long feud with Thomas Wayne over deals and politics. They couldn't have had a more different vision for Gotham. I'm willing to bet my career... on his involvement in the Wayne murders. That's a big bet. I want to use your witness to go after Lovecraft. How? My witness can't connect Lovecraft to the perp. Lovecraft doesn't know that. I'll let it leak out that we have a secret eyewitness who's going to blow the case wide open and connect Lovecraft to the Wayne killings. Lovecraft will get very nervous. And the people around him will get nervous. And that's when people start talking; you know how that goes. Unless Lovecraft wasn't involved in the Wayne murders. If so, which I doubt, we still win. Whoever was involved in the Wayne killings will get their cage rattled like the dickens, won't they? I bet he makes a move. You like to bet a lot. Well, what do we got to lose? My witness becomes a target. No. That's the beauty of it. We never actually file papers. We never name names. It's just a powerful story. Your witness is perfectly safe. And you're on board with this? We've been on board, Jim. Harvey's one of us. I want what you want, Jim. I want to make this city a better place. No names. Not mine, not my witness, nothing... just a story. Just a story. All right. Let's try something. Hey, I thought I was gonna have to work this case without you. Where the hell have you been? You know what? On second thought, never mind, I don't want to know. What do we got? A biggie. Blackgate prisoner escaped while in transit to St. Mark's for psychiatric care. His name's Ian Hargrove, clinically insane, with a compulsion for blowing things up. He exploded a bunch of old buildings around Gotham. Last one, two janitors were killed. Says here he was busted out by four gunmen? Yeah, which is odd... Hargrove never used accomplices. All right, so who did Hargrove spend time with at Blackgate? Who did he communicate with on the outside? His entire stretch, he was isolated from gen pop. Never made or received phone calls. Only one visitor in those two years... his brother John. Got an address? We do. Unis are bringing him in right now for questioning. We're lucky you deigned to show up. Yeah, sorry. No problem. Girl trouble? Yeah. I told you. Those high society dames... get you all twisted. Keep your guard up. Knock lumps out of ya. Watch your feet. Right... jab, jab, right. (grunting) Lead with the... Hey! Jab, jab, right. Jab, jab, right. (grunting) Jab, jab, right. Keep that guard up... jab, jab, right. Lead... jab, jab, right. Jab, jab, right. Now keep that... (grunts fiercely) Yes. (laughing) Oi! Sorry, Alfred. Hello. Bruce. That hurt. Yeah, it's supposed to, isn't it? Taking a punch is just as important as throwing one, Master Bruce. What you doing? Alfred's teaching me to fight. Why? So I'll be prepared if something bad happens. Yeah, 'cause you live in a pretty rough neighborhood. Not here, in Gotham. In Gotham, people don't fight with gloves on. How's your room? Everything good? It'll do. I'm hungry, though. Right. Well, breakfast was served at 8:00, miss, which you slept through. Lunch shall be served at 12:00. There's plenty to eat in the kitchen. And Alfred will be happy to fix you something. No, he won't be, will he? Because it's not a bloody hotel. Relax, old man. I'll figure it out. Yeah, you can mind your manners as well, you cheeky little minx. Be nice to her, Alfred, she's our guest. Well, I'm terribly sorry, Master Bruce. Didn't realize you fancied her. What do you mean? N-No. Well, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's only natural, isn't it? But you watch her. She's a lairy one. Right... left, left, right. (grunts) Keep your guard up, son. You know about girls, do you, Alfred? Fair sight more than you. And she, mate, is trouble... watch. Oi! Oi, oi! Liza, Liza... what are you up to? (inhales deeply) (inhaling) (quiet laugh) Lilacs. I'm telling you, I don't know anything about his escape. I haven't talked to him. Your own baby brother busts out of prison, and doesn't call you, the only person he's talked to in two years? What happened? You two have a falling out? No, Ian and I are close. Always have been. Even after he bombed those janitors? That was an accident. Bullock : That's what they all say. John Hargrove : It's the truth. (timer dings) My brother's not a killer. He never was. He blew up 12 buildings in Gotham. Yes, munitions factories and their offices. Places that made guns and bullets and missiles. I know he was wrong, but Ian thought that what he was doing was good. He didn't hurt a soul until the last bombing. And he felt terrible about it. He practically handed himself in to the cops and pleaded guilty. Ian has had mental problems ever since he was a kid. My parents didn't have the money to get him the help he needed. And he sure as hell wasn't getting it at Blackgate. Look...  my brother's not a bad man. Then what is he? He's sick. There's a difference. Gordon : Okay... so who would want to bust him out? I don't know. But my brother needs help. You have to find him. (door opens) It's done. I have a delivery for you. I'll take that. Oh. Who sent this, anyway? Who cares? Hmm. (timer ticking) Wait a second. You hear that? Sounds like ticking. (timer dings) (explosion booming, men screaming) _ Good morning. Uh-huh. How'd you sleep? Your house makes noise. It's old. You didn't come here with much. If you want, Alfred can buy you some clothes. Pass. Detective Gordon told me you live on the streets. Yeah. So? What's it like? Not as nice as here. Do you live alone? Are you going to ask me questions all morning? Aren't you supposed to be in school or something? I'm developing my own curriculum. It lets me move at my own speed and focus on academic areas that interest me. Why? You're a billionaire, what's to learn? That's a strange attitude. So, where are your parents? They alive? Um... Sure. They're around. Where? What's that to you? Nothing, I just thought... Yeah, well, you thought wrong. I'm not an orphan. I got family all over. This was bad enough when it was just a prison escape. Now we've got five dead security guards, and the press is calling Hargrove an urban terrorist. Did you get anything from the bombing site? Bullock : Forensics is still looking into it, but the entire office was destroyed. Gordon : Including all security footage. Yeah. We do know that Hargrove and his guys made off with a compound called HMX. Gordon : It's military grade. Ten times more powerful than C-4. Nasty stuff. Using explosives to steal explosives. What's that about? Trading up? He must have another target in mind. Some place difficult to crack. You know what I'm gonna say. So, go, do it. (cell phone ringing) This is Gordon. Alfred : Yes, Detective. It's Alfred. Alfred, is everything all right? Is Selina okay? Well, she's safe. But? But I'm afraid, Detective, this isn't gonna work out. She's a... a tough nut, this one. Well, look, we need her help if we have any chance of catching the Waynes' killer. Just hold onto her for now, and I'll be out to check on her as soon as I can. We shall patiently await your arrival, Detective. Everything good? Right as rain. You sure you want to go through with this? Butch, don't you go getting scared on me now. Never, boss. (door opens) Oswald, you're back. (chuckling) I'm starting to think you enjoy being hurt. (chuckles) I was passing by. Thought I'd say hello. Well, you said it. Now why are you here? Honestly, I'm just trying to be friendly. (inhales deeply) (sighs with satisfaction) Lilacs. Mmm. You smell good. You don't. (laughing) Snappy as ever. Oh! (chuckles) Well, good-bye then. Sorry you're still grumpy with me. But, you know, reaching out in friendship is never wrong. Man, that dude's creepy. Forget him. He's nothing. 
 
 Hargrove's contacts and phone records from before he went to Blackgate. Uh-huh. Yeah. You all right? Yeah, yeah. Barbara left. Left left? Yeah. Where'd she go? I don't know. It's a ploy. She wants you to set a date. It's a standard move. She'll be back. Do you play video games? Ed, don't ever do that again. My apologies, Detective. Do either of you play video games? I do, I... (giggles) I love video games. I find that each one presents a new challenge, a puzzle. It's a lot like detective work in that way. Ed. Oh, sorry. Uh, I had a chance to analyze the shrapnel from the security office. And I found something. It's a nameplate. It was damaged in the bombing, but you can still read the information. It's from an abandoned metal factory here in Gotham. That's really good work, Ed. Thanks. Thank you, Detective. Let's go check this out. GCPD! Freeze! Don't shoot! You found the nameplate, thank God. Bullock : Is anyone else here? No, but they'll be back soon. Please, you got to help me. They broke me out of prison, they kidnapped me, they told me they'd kill my brother and his family if I didn't help them. Who's "they"? Russians. One of their names is-is Kasyanov. They're planning something against Falcone. Falcone? Yeah. It's a, it's a big job, a vault. That's why they needed me to build explosives. (men shouting) Behind you! Get down, get down! (man shouting) (men shouting) Help me! (men shouting) Bruce : If you want to go somewhere, we can call you a taxi. You move quiet. So do you. Are you leaving? Thinking about it. I'm sorry if talking about your family upset you. I wasn't upset. You seemed kind of upset. That's your mom, huh? She looks nice. She was. You saw her... the night she was killed? Uh-huh. And you saw me? What I did? What I didn't do? What are you talking about? What could you have done? I don't know... something. You're dreaming, kid. A gun's a gun. My mom's in show business. Oh? Yeah. She sings and dances and does magic tricks. Gets paid, like, millions. But that's just a cover. Really, she's a secret agent for the government. Wow. Yeah. She's on a secret mission. But when she's done, she's coming back to get me. That's good. Yeah. Did you ever kiss a girl? No. Do you want to? Why-why do you ask? Just curious. Time for your studies, Master Bruce. Thank you, Alfred. You're more than welcome to join, Miss Kyle. Right. I'll see you later. Do you have any idea how many angry phone calls we've been getting this week? Got a terrorist out there. And that's our fault? Jim! No, no, please. You tell me, Detective... how is this my fault? Well, for starters, you have the mentally ill housed at Blackgate, a prison with no facilities for them. So, you send them out for treatment, which was exactly where Hargrove was headed when he was broken out. I want him found. Yes, sir. Today. Yes, sir. What is wrong with you? By the way, Hargrove's brother John, I went ahead and put him and his family in protective custody. That'll help. Yeah, only problem is... Hargrove doesn't know that. All right, Dent. You dragged me down here, now what? I got the last piece of the puzzle in place. I'm bringing charges against you. Oh, that old song again? You will never prove fraud. You know that, and I know that. Fraud charges are only part of it. Oh, really? What, then? Jaywalking? Conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Murder? So, tell me, Dent... who did I kill? Thomas and Martha Wayne. (scoffs): Oh, God... I have an eyewitness who can tie you to the crime, you and all the others involved. That's absurd. Help yourself out here, Dick. Think about your options. This is gonna get ugly. (scoffing laugh) You're a fool. And you have no idea who or what you're even dealing with. Don't you ever threaten me! I will rip you open. It was good to see you, Dick. Bullock : Jim! Got it. Yeah? Meet Gregor Kasyanov. Long rap sheet. Worked for Nikolai before he died. Who does he work for now? Beats me. All right. Hargrove said it's a big job, right? A vault. Somebody's got to be bankrolling it. Yeah, someone with cash and pull and beef with Falcone. Problem is... in Gotham, anyone with cash and pull has beef with Falcone. Gordon : Hmm. So, who is it? (Mooney clicks tongue) You kept me waiting. Ran into a little trouble. Nothing to worry about. Good, I've got a lot riding on this job. You've said. Mooney : Your boss Nikolai is dead because of Falcone. You want to get back at him, you hit him where it hurts... his money. Ain't that right, Butch? Yep. The root of all evil. We'll take his money. No problem. As long as it's there, like you said. Oh, it's there. I'm positive. The truck you needed. And Gregor... break a leg. (water burbling) (heart beating) (heartbeat increases) (Selina scoffs) You're the weirdest kid I've ever met. Why are you doing that? Training. Oh... Like the boxing. So, if anyone mugs you with a diving board, you'll be ready, huh? Yes. I mean, no. I'm developing self-discipline and willpower. Why? So I can be strong. I get you, but it won't work. Not on the streets, not in Gotham. Why's that? Out there on the streets, it's not enough to be strong. You gotta be mean. Gotta be ruthless. Do you know what ruthless means? Of course I do. Yeah? Well, you ain't. You're a nice kid. Five minutes on the street, you'll be mincemeat. And holding your breath won't do a damn thing. Host : The subject of today's category is numbers. Here we go. How many bones in the human arm? Thirty-two. Woman : Thirty-two. (bell dings) Host : Correct. Next, how many elements in the periodic table? 118. Woman : Uh... 118. (bell dings) Host : Yes, again. Now for a tough one. How many eyes are there on cards in a deck? Forty-two. Woman : 21. (buzzer sounds) Host : No, I'm sorry. The number you were looking for is 42. You forgot to double it for two eyes. (lively music playing) (whoops, laughs) Host : Well, that concludes our show for today. We'd like to thank all the contestants that participated here in studio and those of you playing along at home. We'll be back right after this. Bullock : Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the explosives? It-it's a very specific type. It's highly volatile, and it's very difficult to manufacture. It's for one use, and one use only. To penetrate iron. Like a vault in a bank. Mm-mm, no, they're all steel. No one makes anything out of iron anymore. Not for... a hundred years, at least. The Gotham Armory. Yeah. Yeah, they have those iron vaults they used to keep the gunpowder in. A few years ago, a private investment group bought it. Ten to one, Falcone's behind it. Hmm...? Do you...? How much longer? It's ready. It didn't work. (laughter echoing) Hey, hey... promise me nobody else is gonna get hurt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem. Cross my heart. You're surrounded! (sirens approaching) There's no way out! (sirens whooping) Drop your weapons! Kasyanov : Don't do it! Get back! Hargrove! Ian Hargrove! Your brother and his family are safe. We have them in protective custody. Kasyanov : If he runs, shoot him! Don't shoot! Man : You shoot him, they shoot us! Drop your weapons! (cell phone ringtone playing) Get away from the truck! Everybody down! Why'd you do that? Bet you can't hit me. I could. But why would I want to? Try. What for? Hit me, and... Hmm... I'll let you kiss me. Ha! You didn't get me. Ah, no! Oh! (laughing) (Bruce shouting playfully) (cell phone ringing) Gordon : Morning, Alfred. Ah, Detective. I've been trying to get out there. I'm sorry, uh... Is everything okay? Is she behaving herself? Well, uh, not really, no. That's all right. It is? Yes, well, she's... a breath of fresh air, I might say. Glad to hear it. I'll be out there as-as soon as I can. Very good, sir. (surprised gasp) Oh... Forgive me for the intrusion, but it's urgent that I speak with you. (laughs) You know who I am. Yeah. And Falcone would kill you if he knew you were here. Perhaps. What would he do if I told him that you were spying on him for Fish Mooney? You don't have any proof. No. But suspicion, it's a funny thing. Hmm? Falcone might not choose to believe me at first, but every time he looked at you, he'd ask himself... is she? Could she? Would she? You're wrong. He cares about me. Let's call him and find out, shall we? (keypad beeping) Stop! Your secret is safe with me. I won't tell, because you... are gonna keep working for Fish. And you are not going to tell anyone. Or you'll die. Gordon : Messages for Gordon. Thanks. Jim. You have a minute? Uh, yeah. I met with Lovecraft. How'd it go? He was scared. He's involved, all right. Scared isn't proof. You didn't see him. Told the same story in a few other spots. All the big players will know by now, someone will start talking. If and when they do, neither of us makes a move without talking first. We move together on this. Absolutely. Hey, nice work on the Hargrove case. You saved the poor guy's life. You're a regular saint. Thanks. Uh, we'll be talking again soon, I hope. You bet. Thanks, Counselor. Finish up with Hargrove? Yeah. He's on his way to Arkham. Arkham? Mayor's directive. He's taking all the criminally insane inmates from Blackgate, sending them to Arkham, so they can get appropriate treatment. That's nuts. Appropriate tr... The building's 200 years old. Welcome to Gotham. Oh, and get this... Hargrove said that the bomb that blew up the money wasn't his. Whose was it? He didn't know. How did it go? Cops were everywhere. Our guys had no way out. I had to make the call. Is everybody dead? Gregor? All his men? Every last one. Good. I can't stand loose strings. You're not mad? That's a hell of a lot of money we just lost. Mad? I couldn't be happier. The point wasn't to steal that money, Butch. It was to hurt Falcone. Well, that you did, Fish. That you did. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for coming. As you well know, the people of Gotham  have been shaken by tragedy in recent days, tragedy no citizen should have to endure. What has happened these past few days is a direct result of Gotham's criminally insane not getting the appropriate treatment and help that we owe them. That is why I am moving forward with plans to turn the recently renovated Arkham Asylum into a remedial facility... All right, let's go, here, man; let's go. For the criminally insane. Gordon : Barbara...
