 You're facing your fears with The Exorcist. 
 -Unclean spirit! -In the name of God! 
 Catch all-new episodes Fridays. 
 And check out our other Fox programs-- 
 The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham. 
 I can make a difference, Alfred. I know I can. 
 Only on Fox. 
 Previously on The Exorcist... I thought it'd be nice if you'd come down to dinner tonight and join us. 
 You could wear your brave face. 
 What the hell are you doing? Asking God for help. 
 You had to come here? 
 Andy, whatever's going on on this island, this is where it's strongest. 
 ROSE: I don't think that you are able to see clearly. 
 Is it possible that maybe you are not the best judge spotting warning signs of depression and self-harm? 
 We believe there's something dangerous at work here, a demon... one that targets families and coerces parents into murdering their own children. 
 Why would she bring them here? 
 NICOLE: She wants them to tear us apart. 
 What should I do? Protect this family. 
 An old rock. 
 What's its significance? 
 Do you blame yourself for your wife's death? 
 Why do you keep asking me these questions? 
 I want you out of my house. 
 I'm not going with you. 
 Mom? 
 Get your damn hands off her! Get back! 
 TOMAS: Behold the cross of the Lord! 
 Flee bands of enemies!

 You will be, too, soon. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I tried. 
 I couldn't stop her. 
 Who, Andy? 
 Nikki... 
 Nikki. I tried to save her. 
 Listen to me, Andy. [GROWLING] 
 This thing is not a wife. 
 That woman that you loved is gone. 
 What you see now is a parasite, feeding off your pain and anger. 
 [ANDY GROANS] 
 It wants you to do terrible things, Andy. 
 But first of all, it needs your obedience. 
 [GASPING, GUTTURAL GRUNTING] 
 [STRAINED GRUNTING] 
 Tell me more about her, Andy. 
 The thing that looks like Nikki. 
 When did she come to you for the first time?

 Let's play hooky, drive over to Yakima, drink some local wine till we talk funny. 
 What is it? 
 [SIGHS] 
 So, there's this girl... 
 I haven't been able to place her. 
 She's been through some stuff, it'd make your hair turn white. 
 But, God, she's amazing. 
 She's smart... she's scary smart, and she's ballsy as hell. 
 She sounds familiar. 
 [EXHALES] 
 I want to bring her here. 
 Wow. 
 I think she needs us, Andy. 
 And I think I need her, too. 
 Well, this is, uh... it's a big step. 
 I know. 
 What do you think? 
 I think you're incredible. 
 Really? Yeah. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 Does this miracle kid have a name? 
 Verity. 
 SHELBY: "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord that they may rest from their labours." 
 Amen. 
 [TRUCK SNIFFLES] 
 I-I can do it. 
 VERITY: No, stop. 
 That's not how you do it. You're... you're... you're supposed to scatter them. 
 I-I did. 
 You just dumped the whole thing. 
 What did he do? 
 He put Mom in the garden. 
 Andy, I-I'm sorry. 
 There's no right way. 
 There's no right way. You guys did a great job. 
 Now, all of you, come here. 
 Come here. 
 Verity. Ver... Verity. 
 Come here. No. Come here. Get off. 
 Get off of me. It's all right, it's all right. 
 It's all right. [VERITY SOBBING] 
 I know. 
 Love you, Mom. 
 Saint Euphemia. TOMAS: Pray for us. 
 MARCUS: Saint Lucy. Pray for us. 
 Marcus. 
 Andy. Andy, listen to my voice. 
 Can you hear me? 
 Andy, there's something inside you. 
 You can feel it, can't you? 
 [GASPS] 
 It's cold. 
 Yes. 
 And it's got its filthy hands wrapped around your memories. 
 It lies, Andy. 
 It twists. 
 You don't have to do this alone. 
 Let us help. 
 I can't. 
 It's too strong. MARCUS: No, no, no. 
 It just wants you to feel like that, 'cause that's what miserable little pissant schoolyard bullies do. 
 They make you feel weak and small. 
 But you've fought monsters before, I know you have. 
 Every single day you're out there, fighting for those kids. 
 Keep fighting. 
 Tell us how it first came to you. 
 Please, keep looking. 
 We can unravel its work, but we have to know where to start. 
 TOMAS: Andy, stay with me. 
 Listen to my voice. 
 Andy, listen to my voice. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Truck's baseball uniform was getting seriously rank. 
 I figured you could use some fresh sheets while I was at it. 
 We're almost out of detergent, but I can make a run after class. 
 If you want. 
 Yeah. Thanks, V. 
 Thank you. 
 Did she say anything? 
 Before? 
 Not to me, no. 
 It's so stupid; she wasn't even sad. 
 It's not about being sad, kiddo. 
 Depression's a disease. 
 And when you don't ask for help... 
 Yeah? And what if she was asking this whole time, and no one was listening? 
 MARCUS: Andy. Andy. 
 The first time it came to you, what form did it take? 
 Remember. Remember. 
 Remember. 
 [SOBBING] 
 GRACE: It's okay, Andy. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Grace. 
 Hi, Grace. 
 I'm Andy. 
 I know, silly. 
 Why are you sad? 
 I lost my friend. 
 I could be your friend. 
 [LOW SNARLING] 
 What's that you got there? 
 My mask. 
 I get scared sometimes. 
 I don't like going outside. 
 Is that right? 
 Can you help me, Andy? 
 I can try. 
 Maybe I can help you, too. 
 I'd like that. 
 MARCUS: Fight it, Andy. 
 You have to fight it. 
 Wait, Grace. 
 Grace. Grace. 
 Grace? 
 Grace? 
 Grace? 
 Boo. 
 Nikki. 
 Hey, you. 
 My Andy-bear. 
 What have they done to you? 
 I don't know what's happening. 
 Nikki, I think I'm losing my mind. 
 They're trying to break us apart. 
 But we aren't going to let them... are we? 
 Andy. Andy, stay with us. [ANDY GASPING] 
 Andy, fight back. 
 For your children. 
 Fight back, Andy. 
 No, we're not. 
 [LOW SNARLING] TOMAS: Be patient, Rose. 
 You have to trust us to help him. 
 ROSE: There is a dead body in the next room. 
 How are we supposed to explain that? 
 Because I'm guessing "killed by a demon" isn't going to fly when the cops show up. 
 We finish the exorcism, then we deal with the consequences. 
 We stop now, Andy dies. 
 If we take him to hospital, other people die. 
 We're close, Rose. 
 Can he hear us? 
 Not likely. 
 The kids, how are they doing? 
 They watched their father murder someone. 
 How do you think they're doing? 
 I'll give you as much time as I can, but I can't keep them on the island forever. 
 These kids are monitored by the state. 
 They go missing for too long, someone's gonna come looking. 
 Then we have to work faster.

 Don't look at them. 
 Look at me. 
 Come back to me. 
 You look weird. 
 What? You're weird. [NICOLE LAUGHS] 
 How'd I get so lucky? 
 It's not luck when you get what you deserve. 
 [NICOLE SIGHS] 
 And you do deserve this. 
 You have worked so hard. 
 It's okay to be a little selfish. 
 Enjoy the win. 
 Where are the kids? 
 [SIGHS] I think I saw them in the garden. 
 I should check on them. 
 Or... we could do other things. 
 What kind of things? 
 Hmm. Terrible things. 
 [ANDY CHUCKLES] 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] Terrible... 
 [DEMONIC LAUGHTER] 
 [YELLING] 
 Andy. Stay with us. [ANDY GROANS] 
 You have to stay with us, Andy! 
 Stay with us, stay with us. 
 [TOMAS SPEAKING GIBBERISH] You have to fight this. 
 To fight it. That's it. 
 [YELLING] You have to stay with us, Andy! 
 Focus on my voice. 
 What you're seeing, it is a demon. 
 One that targets families, children. 
 It will try to turn you against them, make you harm them. 
 MARCUS: The demon will harvest your memories, it will corrupt them. Whatever it's showing you... it is not real. 
 What you're seeing, it is not your wife. [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 Uh-uh. No peeking. 
 Ready? Yes. 
 [ANDY LAUGHS] 
 What do you think? 
 [LAUGHING]: Oh, my God. 
 I can't believe you did all this. Ah! 
 Just like you always wanted. 
 Do you like it? 
 [SIGHS] It's perfect. 
 How did we afford all this? 
 NICOLE: Well, how do you think? 
 [NICOLE LAUGHS] 
 Where are the boys? 
 They're in the garden. 
 Oh, let me show you my studio. 
 Come, come. 
 Come on. 
 Ta-da! 
 Where's Verity? 
 It's everything we've ever wanted. 
 Do you like it? 
 Where's Verity's stuff? Where's Harper? 
 Andy. 
 Verity? Boys? 
 [NICOLE SIGHS] Where are they? 
 I told you. 
 In the garden. 
 Kids? 
 Kids?! 
 Kids? 
 No. No! 
 No! No! 
 [WHIMPERING] 
 No! No! No! No! 
 No! No! 
 [GROANS, PANTS] 
 [PANTING] You do understand, don't you? 
 It had to be this way. 
 They're the reason why I died. 
 What? 
 [PANTING] I needed you, Andy. 
 They took you from me. 
 They did this. 
 I know my wife. 
 She would never say something like that, not in a million years. 
 Never. 
 Well, you also never thought I'd kill myself. 
 Nikki was depressed. 
 Because of them. 
 No, that's not the way it works. 
 There's no... there's no blame. 
 It's a chemical imbalance in the brain. 
 The only imbalance was a house full of someone else's children, and a husband too busy being Father of the Year to notice what was happening right underneath his nose. 
 [GUTTURAL GASPING] 
 I can see pretty clearly right now. 
 You're not my wife. [GASPING]: Andy... 
 These aren't my memories. 
 Get out of my head! 
 You don't remember, Andy! 
 You don't remember what those children were like! 
 [ECHOING]: Let me show you. 
 Mmm. You taste like mac and cheese. 
 You like that? 
 Oh, it's so hot. 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 Mmm. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
 CALEB: No, I didn't. TRUCK: You looked at it! 
 [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
 Should we...? Absolutely not. 
 TRUCK: I worked so hard on that! 
 [WHISPERING]: I think we're safe. 
 Okay. 
 [FEET RUNNING, DOOR OPENS] 
 I can't believe you did that. Caleb stepped on my diorama set, and it's broke. It was in the middle of the room. 
 It was on my side of the room! 
 Hey, guys. I can have stuff there. 
 TRUCK: It was on my side of the room! 
 He threw a piece at my head! 
 Guys, this is part of sharing a room. 
 Go back to bed. Now. 
 I don't want to share a room with him. I-It... He's an idiot! 
 ANDY: Out, now. Hey! That's... hey! 
 You... Boys! 
 Go back to bed! 
 Ah, that is... Stop it. 
 Okay? Break it up. TRUCK: I'm not an idiot. 
 Go on. We'll talk about it in the morning. 
 [SIGHS] 
 
 
 
 Hey, you okay? 
 What if we're not cut out for this? 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 What if we made a mistake? 
 That's not how it happened. 
 That's now what she said. You sure about that? 
 They walked in on us, it was an accident. 
 It was an accident! 
 Well, everything's an accident when it's not your fault. 
 Or maybe you just don't want to see the truth. 
 VERITY: Please, don't act like you care. 
 NICOLE: Of course I care about you. You're my daughter. 
 VERITY: I'm not your daughter. 
 Why can't you get that through your head? 
 I already have one worthless mom. 
 I don't need another. 
 Verity. NICOLE: Listen, Verity, I understand you're very upset right now. 
 VERITY: Then send me back. 
 Get me off this lame-ass island. 
 O-Out of this lame-ass make-believe family. 
 I wish you never would have brought me here. 
 All we've ever done is love you. 
 All you've ever done is cash a paycheck. 
 Why don't you go pop some crazy pills and cry in the bathroom some more? 
 It's not like the rest of us haven't heard you already. 
 Enough. 
 Enough. 
 [QUIETLY]: Whatever. 
 Nikki, she didn't mean it. 
 She didn't mean it. 
 Baby, please. 
 Baby. 
 MARCUS: And it's got its filthy hands wrapped around your memories. 
 It lies, Andy. 
 It twists. 
 Is that all you got? 
 [RUMBLING] 
 'Cause you don't know my daughter. 
 You sure as hell don't know Nicole, because that is not how it ended. 
 [RUMBLING, RATTLING] 
 That's not how it ended! 
 ANDY [MUMBLING]: That's not how it ended.
