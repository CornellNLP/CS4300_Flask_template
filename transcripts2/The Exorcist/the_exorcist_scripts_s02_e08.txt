 You're facing your fears with The Exorcist. 
 -Unclean spirit! -In the name of God! 
 Catch all-new episodes Fridays. 
 And check out our other Fox programs-- 
 The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham. 
 I can make a difference, Alfred. I know I can. 
 Only on Fox. 
 Previously on The Exorcist... You let a demon into your head, Tomas. 
 Evil leaves a mark. It stains. 
 Now, every thought that you have, every decision that you make is compromised. 
 You were right. These visions, they're not a gift. 
 They're a curse. 
 My little church mouse. 
 Marcus? What is this? 
 Ask her what happened at the abbey 
 20 years ago. 
 Andy! 
 Nikki, I think I'm losing my mind. 
 They're trying to break us apart. 
 You have to fight this! 
 But we aren't going to let them. 
 No, we're not. 
 Hey, Grace. 
 Did you talk to him? How is he? 
 Where's Russ and Colleen? 
 Uh, upstairs. 
 Harper had another nightmare. 
 Did she say anything? 
 Not to the Holstroms, but I think they know something's up. 
 What about Andy? 
 Uh, Tomas and Marcus say these things take some time, but he is fighting back, so that's good news, and that we should keep praying. 
 Right, 'cause that's been so helpful. 
 He needs real help. 
 How do you know they're not just making things worse? 
 They're trying to help us, V. 
 And we're supposed to just trust them? 
 It's been three days. 
 You can't just keep us here forever. 
 I'm taking the four of you off the island. 
 First thing tomorrow morning. 
 What? 
 You can't do that. 
 Your safety takes precedence over everything else, even Andy. 
 What's gonna happen to us? 
 We'll find temporary housing, hopefully together, but I can't make any promises. 
 For how long? 
 Until we get everything sorted out. 
 That is such crap. 
 Andy killed someone, and we all saw it. 
 Will you please keep your voice down? 
 Do you think the cops are gonna care that he had a demon in him? 
 Give him a slap on the wrist, let him go back to being a foster parent. 
 We all move back home, no big deal. 
 Does that sound real likely to anyone else? 
 No. No, it doesn't. 
 We're never going back. 
 Did you hear that? 
 I didn't hear anything. 
 Your place is in solitude. 
 Begone. Your abode is in the nest of serpents. 
 Get down and crawl with them. 
 Looking a bit ragged there, Marcus. 
 The years weigh heavy on you. 
 Perhaps you'd like to take a break. 
 We'll be fine without you, won't we, Father? 
 The Lord, our ruler, comes quickly. 
 A kindling fire before Him. 
 After all, we have so much to discuss. 
 How long before he fails you? 
 Like the one that came before. 
 Oh. 
 You didn't tell him about your little church mouse. 
 What is he talking about? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Ah! 
 You might delude man, but you cannot mock God. 
 Come back to us, Andy. You have to fight this. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Andy's not here. 
 Then it's He who casts you out. 
 It is He who repels you. 
 It is He who expels you. 
 Who touches the living and the dead and the world by fire! 
 Hey. 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't know. It's just... 
 How long have we been here? 
 You're getting tired of me. 
 You know that's impossible. 
 But sooner or later, we are gonna have to leave this room. 
 We will. 
 When the time is right. 
 Just leave everything to me. 
 How long was I out? 
 A few hundred miles. 
 How is it? 
 I'm fine. 
 Your fever's getting worse. 
 Means the wound's most likely infected. 
 You need a bloody hospital. 
 We need to find Marcus and Tomas. 
 Warning them is all that matters. 
 Is that why you agreed to come with me? 
 Because of him? 
 What are you talking about? 
 The demon inside Maria Walters. 
 It spoke to you in Marcus's voice. 
 You know him. 
 And? 
 And you never thought this was worth mentioning. 
 We worked together. 
 For a time. 
 You were friends. 
 I don't have friends. 
 You know, you're gonna hurt my feelings. 
 Oh. If you were a real friend, you'd let me take you to the hospital. 
 Bennett? 
 Bennett? 
 Damn it. 
 _ 
 Sleeping on the job I see. 
 Not very professional. 
 Yeah, I never claimed to be a professional, did I? 
 Ready? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Ow. 
 It's not my fault you got hair like a sheepdog. 
 Should I be trusting you with scissors? 
 I know what's under those wimples. 
 There's still time to change your mind, you know. 
 Skip your initiation. 
 Run off, live a normal life. 
 I could say the same to you. 
 Yeah, except... this life chose me. 
 Not the other way around. 
 You're lucky. 
 How do you mean? 
 Because you don't have to wonder. 
 You're a vessel for the word of God. 
 His power flows through you. 
 The rest of us are just fumbling around in the dark, hoping it's all real. 
 How's our guest? 
 You want to see her again, don't you? 
 I'm not allowed. 
 So... easily scared. 
 It's... really, really charming. 
 I'd never let anything happen to my little church mouse. 
 I'd kill for a decent cup of coffee. 
 This is just pig swill. 
 And caffeine, so drink up. 
 One battle at a time, mate. 
 We're not going to be able to keep this hidden for much longer. 
 I know. 
 The demon said you had another partner. 
 A little church mouse. 
 She wasn't a partner. 
 She was just a friend. 
 A long time ago. 
 What happened to her? 
 Nothing... happened. 
 I moved on to another case, she took her vows. 
 She's probably a fat, happy little nun living in Brighton somewhere. 
 Then why bring it up? 
 It's a demon, Tomas. 
 It wants to get inside your head. 
 You know so much about me, but I hardly know anything about your life. 
 My life is a series of rooms, demons, and coffee that tastes like pond water. 
 Not much more than that, I promise you. 
 Come on, let's get back to work. 
 So, all you really need to do is just feed him in the morning and at nighttime, and he really likes it if you take him out to fly. 
 Oh, not a problem. 
 We'll get along just fine, won't we, Morty? Huh? 
 Ah, don't you guys worry too much. 
 I had a bout of pneumonia a couple years ago; knocked me on my ass, but I survived. 
 Andy will, too. 
 Yeah. Thanks, Russ. 
 You'll be home before you know it. 
 How's it going? 
 Super awesome. 
 Is this for school? 
 Andy gave me that, when I came to live with him. 
 Hmm. 
 He knew I was into, like... building stuff. 
 It's stupid. 
 Why is that stupid? 
 Because, what, like, I'm gonna go to college? 
 Become an engineer? 
 Why not? You're clever. 
 I'm not gonna have a roof over my head in six months. 
 Let alone money for college. 
 Andy won't let that happen. 
 Yeah, and what if Andy's dead? 
 Honey. 
 It's just pneumonia. 
 Right. 
 Pneumonia. 
 Your friend went into septic shock, so we had to intubate him. Can I ask what happened? 
 He broke a window. And instead of going to the hospital, he decided to duct tape his stomach shut? Mm. 
 He doesn't like doctors. 
 How soon before we can wake him? 
 He's stabilized, but we're not out of the woods yet. 
 We're gonna have to keep him sedated and under observation for the next few days. 
 We don't have time for that. 
 This isn't a discussion. 
 This is what's happening. 
 I should tell you that in cases that suggest assault, we're obligated to inform the police. 
 Hello, Miriam. 
 There she is. 
 Again. 
 But where's her chaperone? 
 And what would he say, if Father Marcus knew how often you come to visit? 
 Alone. 
 Sneaky, sneaky girl. 
 I adjure you, profligate dragon, in the name of the spotless Lamb, who has trodden down the asp and the basilisk, and overcome the lion and the dragon... 
 I am the dragon. 
 What are you? 
 Nothing. 
 Tremble and flee, as we call on the name of the Lord, Holy Lord, God of Sabaoth. 
 Nothing special. 
 Nothing at all. 
 But with so much to prove. 
 The Word made flesh commands you... 
 You'll never know what it means to be chosen. 
 To see what he sees. 
 The Virgin's Son commands you. 
 Jesus of Nazareth commands you... 
 12 years old, and he sees the face of the Almighty. 
 How is that fair? 
 I could show it to you, if you're strong enough to bear it. 
 That's why you're here, isn't it? 
 To feel what he feels. 
 I adjure you in His name... 
 Or perhaps he's right about you. 
 You're weak. 
 Harmless. 
 Nothing. 
 I adjure you in His name... 
 You want to fumble in the dark for the rest of your life, or do you want to see the true face of God? 
 I adjure you in His name... 
 I thought you said you could help. 
 A normal exorcism can take weeks. 
 Sometimes months. 
 We just... we don't have that kind of time. 
 What exactly are you asking? 
 We can't save Andy if we can't reach him. 
 Right now, he can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality. 
 We need him to remember who he's fighting for. 
 No. We're running out of options. 
 You think I'm gonna put the children in the same room as him after what they saw? 
 Not all of them, no. 
 Maybe just one of them. 
 You think that's what Andy would want? 
 Using one of his children as bait? 
 We are losing him, Rose. 
 I'll do it. 
 Verity... 
 I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life wondering if there was something I could've done to help him fight this thing. 
 I'm not asking for permission. 
 From either of you. 
 I'm doing this. 
 Hey. Morning. 
 Going to Andy's. 
 I heard he had, uh, pneumonia. 
 The kids are staying at the neighbors. 
 That's right, yeah. 
 Must be one hell of an infection to call in a couple of priests. 
 Ex-priest. 
 You want a ride? 
 Have no power over her. 
 Lord, send her aid from your holy place. 
 Lord, heed my prayer. 
 Marcus... 
 Hey. 
 Hey, there you are. 
 My little church mouse. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 Please. 
 Just... let me... 
 It's my fault, just let it take me. 
 Now you're being insulting. 
 I-I've never lost a single soul, I ain't about to start with you, am I? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 There's this, um... this knees-up little country pub near Warwick. 
 Ah, there's a podgy lad who plays the guitar. 
 I swear, it feels like he's strumming your rib cage. 
 Let's skive off for a couple of weeks. 
 Soak ourselves inside out with cider. 
 You thought you were getting away with something, didn't you? 
 Never broke your vows. 
 Not technically. 
 How were you gonna end it anyway, huh? 
 Were you gonna run away with her, Casanova? 
 We'll dance until they kick us out. 
 A-And when they kick us out, we'll-we'll dance in the alley till the sun comes up. 
 I owe you thanks, priest. 
 Made her ripe for the picking. 
 And when you get tired, Mouse, I'll put you on my back, and I'll dance us all the way home. 
 God is jealous. 
 And greedy. Mouse. 
 But I'm not. 
 Just let her love you, Father Marcus. 
 My gift to you. 
 Oh, what have I done? 
 Mouse... 
 Please forgive me. 
 So, um, what's really going on in there, Marcus? 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 Just trust me when I say that we're doing everything we can. 
 I do. Trust you. 
 But when this is all over, whatever it is you're doing, you and I are gonna open up a bottle of bourbon and have a long, long talk. 
 You think I'm sticking around after this, then? 
 You don't have to stick around. We could get in the truck, go for a drive, see where we land. 
 Sounds so... normal. 
 You say that like that's a bad thing. 
 What about my work? 
 Retire? 
 Thank you, Peter. 
 For everything. 
 You're not up for this. 
 I'm fine. 
 Remember, anything it says to you, it's the demon talking. 
 It's not your dad. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 The important thing is to keep your guard up. 
 The demon'll look into your heart, use whatever it can find against you. 
 Let the damn thing try. 
 Hello, Verity. Hi. 
 Don't get too close. 
 Hey, Andy. 
 They said I could see you. 
 Can you hear me? 
 No, I don't think you should. 
 I have some things that I need to tell you... if you're in there. 
 And I think you are. 
 You took me in... you and Nikki, when no one else would, because you believed in me. 
 "Believed in you..." 
 Poor Verity still doesn't understand. 
 We took you in for the paycheck. 
 That's not true. 
 
 
 
 When they find your body, frozen in some alley, needle marks in your arms, they'll say, "She never had a chance." 
 'Cause that's what happens to little girls that nobody wants. 
 Trash becomes trash. 
 Okay. 
 That's enough. Give her a chance. 
 I'm not going to stand here... I can do this. 
 Verity? 
 It's me, Nikki. 
 Mom. 
 Do you want to know what went through my head as I stepped into the water? 
 I thought, "At least I'll never have to see that gutter rat Verity again." 
 That is not your mother. 
 That is a demon. 
 Hold on to what is true, and reject the lies. 
 You... were such... a disappointment. 
 You must reject the demon. 
 You're right, Andy. 
 I was a disappointment. 
 I was snotty and rude and selfish. 
 I thought if I could just push you hard enough, you'd drop the whole stupid foster parent act and just admit that you hated me. 
 The same as everyone else. 
 But you didn't. 
 No matter what I did, you always loved me and believed in me and fought for me. 
 You were a really good dad. 
 And I don't want to say good-bye to you. 
 So, you got to fight, okay? 
 You need to come back to us. 
 Verity. 
 Dad? Listen to me. 
 I love you. 
 I love you so much, but you need to go... 
 Won't let you hurt her. 
 I won't let you hurt her. 
 Leave! 
 Go! Rose, get her out of here! 
 Get her out of here! 
 "Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the Devil's schemes." 
 Kyrie eleison, God, our Lord, King of ages... 
 All-powerful and All-mighty... 
 Where there is envy and malice... 
 Give us abundance... 
 Hey. 
 You were incredible. 
 Father, she's awake. 
 There's no sign of contamination. 
 Let her go. 
 Welcome back, my child. 
 Who... 
 My name is Father Robert. 
 Do you know where you are? 
 You understand what happened to your soul and your body? 
 All because of your curiosity. 
 Where's Marcus? 
 Father Marcus was unable to complete the exorcism. 
 He left three weeks ago. 
 No... 
 You're lucky I stepped in when I did... you were nearly lost. 
 No. He... he wouldn't leave me. 
 God willing, young Father Marcus will learn from this day, as will you. 
 And the next time you feel the urge to go poking around where you don't belong, remember your place. 
 You're God's bride, my child. 
 All right, I'm gonna go get the tickets. 
 You guys wait in the car. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 When was the last time you slept? 
 I don't know. 
 It's been a couple of days, hasn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you want me to take over? 
 What, and let you have all the fun? 
 Here you go. Thank you. 
 Looks like we just missed this one, so it's gonna be a bit of a wait. 
 You guys want any snacks? 
 Where's Verity? 
 We're not supposed to say. 
 Guys, where's Verity? 
 Sh-She forgot some book over at Russ and Colleen's. 
 I told her it was stupid, but, you know... 
 All right, Shelby. 
 You're in charge. 
 Tattletale. 
 Get in the car. 
 Leave me alone. 
 I'll get you another copy of that damn book. 
 Andy gave it to me. You can't replace it. 
 Then I'll send it to you. 
 No, you can't. I threw it in the trash. 
 Verity, I... we don't have time for this. 
 No. You don't get to say no to this. 
 I am walking away from everything, my whole life. 
 And that book is the one thing... it's the one thing that I have from him. 
 And I'm not leaving without it. 
 Get in the car. 
 I'll drive you. 
 "When the wicked, my enemies and my oppressors come near me to devour my flesh, they stumble and fall..." 
 Poor Peter. 
 Could have been so normal together. 
 "When the wicked, my enemies and my oppressors come near me to devour my flesh, they stumble and fall..." 
 It's not your enemies that devour your flesh. 
 It's the people you love and that's why you leave them. 
 "When the wicked..." 
 Marcus... 
 Don't. It's my fault. 
 Let it take me. 
 I heard your little mouse was delicious. 
 Marcus. Marcus. 
 Marcus. Marcus! 
 Marcus! I'm fine! I'm fine! 
 You're not fine. 
 You're not fine. 
 And that thing is using it against you. 
 You're going to make a mistake. 
 You need to rest. 
 Let's take it in turns. 
 We'll work in shifts. Fine. 
 As long as I go first. 
 Okay. 
 "not fear. 
 Though war break out against me, I will be confident. 
 We cast you out, every unclean spirit." 
 You look better. 
 I feel better. 
 How's our man doing? 
 The demon is losing its hold. 
 Andy's gonna beat it. 
 I wanted to thank you for before, making me stand down. 
 I'm so used to looking out for you, feels a bit funny the other way around. 
 You're not an apprentice anymore, Tomas. 
 You're an exorcist. 
 And I'm proud to stand beside you... brother. 
 I... 
 I didn't know how much I needed to hear that. 
 Shall we? 
 Holy Mary... 
 Pray for us. 
 Holy Mother of God... 
 Pray for us. 
 Holy Virgin of virgins... 
 Pray for us. Saint Michael... 
 Pray for us. Saint Gabriel... 
 Pray for us. Saint Raphael... 
 Is it my turn? 
 Uh... yeah, just... 
 What's happening? 
 What is it? 
 Shelby... 
 Shelby, I'm scared. It's just the lights. 
 What is it? It's just the lights. 
 Russ? 
 Colleen? 
 Hey, sorry, I forgot something. 
 Anybody home? 
 Hello? 
 Hello?

 Rose? 
 Hey, kiddo.
