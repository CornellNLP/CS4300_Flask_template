 Ana? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Waiting for you. 
 Wait, that's... that's not possible. 
 God, it's been 22 years. 
 You're not my sister. 
 Why did you leave Punia? 
 When the cardinal found me on the streets... it was my chance to escape this life. 
 Get an education, become something more. 
 I had to take it. 
 You said you would come back. 
 I did. 
 I tried. 
 I couldn't find you, I was... 
 I was too late. 
 (sighs) 
 I... I waited for you. 
 I'm so sorry, Ana. 
 I'm just glad you're back. 
 (exhales, sniffles) 
 I won't leave you. 
 Ever again. 
 PRIEST: And you're sure he's the best candidate? 
 The Office of Exorcism has been a stain on our faith for far too long. 
 I can think of no one more suited to do the convincing than Father Bennett. 
 Assuming he returns to us with the proper... temperament. 
 And how are we doing tonight? 
 VATICAN OFFICIAL: Fine, thank you. 
 You ask me, I think your friend is gonna wake up soon. 
 Is that right? 
 I was in here earlier and I'm pretty sure I heard him talking in his sleep. 
 Praise the Lord. 
 (hissing, demonic whispers) 
 (grunts) 
 (grunts) 
 (panting) 
 Took you long enough. 
 Hello, Marcus. 
 * 
 Are you gonna talk to her, or just keep brooding? 
 What's she even doing here? 
 She was at the house when I woke up. 
 I came with Bennett to find you. 
 I don't see him anywhere. 
 I left him in a hospital outside of Spokane. 
 He was injured by your friend, Maria Walters. 
 Is he all right? 
 You saw Maria? 
 Saw her die. 
 You're welcome, by the way. 
 Miserable creature. 
 Still doesn't answer my question. 
 Why are you here? 
 The Church has been compromised. 
 Every exorcist is being recalled from the field. 
 They're hunting down the ones that resist-- turning or killing them. 
 Not what I'm asking. 
 You, Mouse. 
 -Why are you here? -MOUSE: I don't need permission from you, or the Church. 
 You lost the right to tell me what to do 
 -when you walked out that door. -You were in good hands. 
 I should have been in your hands. 
 I was in Hell, Marcus. For six months. 
 And you just left me there. 
 I fought to save you. 
 Day and night. Everything I had, everything inside me, it wasn't enough. 
 I wasn't enough. 
 You needed help that I wasn't fit to give. 
 I needed you. 
 (whispers): I never wanted this life for you. 
 We have no time for this. 
 You sent the kids off the island to find help. 
 That means people will come looking for us. 
 We'll do what we can in the time we've got left. 
 What a lovely day for an exorcism. 
 (laughing) 
 (thunder rumbles) 
 Is there, like, some... stupid Bible verse I can say or something? 
 You mean, like a prayer? 
 Like whatever. 
 I just... 
 I need to do something. 
 You could start by asking God for help. 
 Does it matter if I don't... exactly, totally believe? 
 No. 
 No, it doesn't matter. 
 MARCUS: Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High 
 -will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. -(growls) 
 I will say of the Lord, "He is my refuge and my fortress, -my God, in whom I trust." -Surely He will save you... 
 -(snarls) -...from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you will find refuge. 
 -You will not fear the terror of the night... -(yowls) 
 ...nor the arrow that flies by day! 
 (panting) 
 (demonic panting) 
 Nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. 
 MARCUS/MOUSE: A thousand may fall at your side, 10,000 at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 
 -TOMAS: They will lift you up in their hands... -(groans) 
 ...so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 
 You will tread on the lion and the cobra. 
 -You will trample the great lion and the serpent. -(growls) 
 "Because he loves me," says the Lord. 
 -"I will rescue him. I will protect him, -(boards creaking) because he acknowledges my name." 
 -He will call on me and I will answer him. -(screams) 
 With long life, I will satisfy him, and show him my salvation! 
 (demonic screaming) 
 (laughs) 
 This one's strong. 
 We're running out of time. 
 (helicopter blades whirring) 
 How long until they find us? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 We keep working. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 What do you think's gonna happen when the police show up? 
 Get yourself arrested and the enemy wins. 
 (gun cocks) I can't allow that. 
 Well, this is new. 
 -What are you doing? -MOUSE: What you should have done a long time ago: kill the host, kill the demon. 
 You've lost him either way. 
 At least this way we save his soul. 
 Put the gun down. 
 Tell me I'm wrong. 
 We're exorcists... 
 ...not executioners. 
 ANDY: I know a priest in Chicago who would beg to differ. 
 Slit his throat from ear to ear. 
 What's he talking about? 
 It was an integrated demon; it left me no other choice. 
 There's always a choice. 
 Every kill I've made, every finger on the trigger, every hand closing around a little throat, it all came down to that one choice. 
 That's what makes it all so tasty. 
 Don't listen to it. 
 I'm not. 
 You act like Brother Simon was the first, but his is not the face you see when you close your eyes. 
 (as Marcus's father): Where are yeh, Marky-boy? 
 I know you're in here. 
 My dad was a mad dog. 
 I did what needed to be done. 
 You tell yourself that. 
 But your mum were long dead, and the door right there. 
 You could have run. 
 You could have gone for help. 
 You chose to take that gun off the wall. 
 That's why it haunts you. 
 Not because you regret it, but because you enjoyed it. 
 It makes you wonder if that violence in your heart was always there. 
 Or if it gets passed from one generation to the next. 
 (whispers): You know something? 
 You're the first one that ever got that right. 
 Lucky me. 
 MOUSE: My question is, why is it still here? 
 It failed to kill the family, it knows it can't beat all three of us, so why hasn't it left? 
 Because of Andy. 
 He's trapping it inside the body, holding it in place until we kill it. 
 So then we honor his last request. 
 Destroy the demon while we still have a chance. 
 But you're talking about murder. 
 We don't have time to finish the exorcism. 
 And Andy can't keep holding that thing back forever. 
 -It will escape. -There is another way. 
 We offer something it wants even more. 
 (whispers): Bait. 
 Absolutely not. 
 The demon let me in once before. 
 The only way it's going to release its hold on Andy is if a better host comes along. 
 You've said it yourself-- there's no higher prize than an exorcist. 
 You're talking about a suicide run. 
 I am talking about saving Andy. 
 Andy's still in there. 
 I saw him, I spoke with him. 
 Even if there's a chance we can save him... 
 You let that thing inside your head, you're not coming back out. 
 ...even the slightest chance, we have to take it. 
 You taught me that, Marcus. 
 We go to the ends of the earth. We bring them back. 
 Nothing else matters. 
 It'll take your soul, Tomas. 
 It'll destroy you. 
 It was my fault Andy escaped. 
 It was my fault I let the demons in. 
 I need to make things right. 
 What, by throwing your life away? 
 My life belongs to God. 
 It has always been in His hands. 
 I don't want to lose you. 
 Then bring me back. 
 No, this is madness. 
 Just let him do it. 
 Tomas, stop. He's not worth it. 
 Don't listen to her, priest. 
 It's just you... and me. 
 You can feel it, can't you? 
 Scratching at the back of your mind. 
 Like little claws, skritch, scratch. 
 Waiting to come in. 
 All you have to do is say the word. 
 You want me? 
 Come and get me. 
 (seething breaths) 
 (floor creaks softly) 
 * 
 (gasps) 
 (clattering upstairs) 
 * 
 (loud clattering) 
 (loud clattering) 
 (demonic whispers) 
 (overlapping voices) 
 (growling) 
 (panting) 
 Andy. 
 We have to hurry. 
 It won't be gone long; it never is. Come on. 
 To the bedroom. The bedroom. 
 (Tomas panting) 
 (panting) 
 Every time I kill it, it comes back a little stronger. 
 We're getting you out of here. 
 (whispers): No. 
 I can't leave. 
 People are dead, Father. 
 Russ and Colleen, Harper's mom. 
 Because I brought this thing into our lives. 
 I let it hurt Rose... 
 (whispers): and the children. 
 How am I supposed to live with myself? 
 How can they ever forgive me? 
 You might be surprised. 
 If I leave... the demon runs... 
 ...with some other family. 
 We have to kill it. 
 (rumbling) 
 Father. 
 -If this goes wrong... -No, no, no, it won't. 
 (whispers): But if it does... 
 ...I want you to take back a message for the kids. 
 (whispers): Say what you have to say. 
 MOUSE: You could have stopped him. 
 You don't know my partner. 
 I know you're wasting his talent. 
 God sent you an atom bomb, and you're trying to turn him into a surgeon's scalpel. 
 Thing about bombs, they explode, destroying themselves and everything around them. 
 Only if we're not there to protect him, show him the way. 
 What do you think I've been doing? 
 The old way doesn't work anymore, Marcus. 
 How long does it take to save a single soul? 
 Weeks. Months. 
 And in that time, the enemy takes a hundred more hosts. 
 -I'm aware. -Are you? 
 You asked me why I came. 
 I came because we're losing, and I don't know what else to do. 
 And if there's a chance that his gift can help turn the tide, we need to take it. 
 (loud clattering) 
 I don't see anything. 
 (clattering in distance) 
 (clattering) 
 (clattering) 
 (door creaking) 
 (floor creaking) 
 You ever have one of those dreams you feel like you can't wake up from? 
 That'd be nice, huh? 
 If this was all a dream? 
 Yeah. 
 -(yells) -Andy! 
 (screaming) 
 * 
 (gasps) 
 (demonic growling) 
 (gasps) 
 -(cracking) -(shouts) 
 (pounding) 
 ANDY: That won't work. 
 Andy. 
 (pounding) 
 I can't hold her back anymore. 
 -Andy. -(weakly): She's too strong. 
 You don't have to fight anymore. 
 It's my turn. 
 What do you mean? 
 If I offer myself to the demon, it will let you go. 
 No. 
 That wasn't part of the deal. 
 I'm changing the deal. 
 (pounding) 
 Go home, Andy. 
 Be with your kids. 
 It's my... mistake. 
 (groans) 
 It's my responsibility. 
 (pounding) 
 No. 
 We cast you out... every unclean spirit, -(pounding, clattering) -every satanic power... every onslaught of the infernal adversary. 
 (praying in Spanish) 
 (Tomas continues praying softly) 
 ...driven from this good man. 
 From his soul, made in the image and likeness of God, and redeemed by the precious blood of the divine lamb! 
 Any onslaught of the infernal adversary. 
 We cast you out! 
 ANDY: Father. 
 (demonic voice): Hello, Father. 
 Let him go. 
 Take me instead. 
 With pleasure. 
 No! 
 MOUSE: Something's wrong. 
 Tomas. Tomas. Tomas! 
 Bloody Tomas, I need you to wake up. 
 Wake up! 
 (Tomas gasping) 
 -(yells) -(growling) 
 MARCUS: Get out of there. 
 Tomas. Tomas, get out of there! 
 MOUSE: We're losing him. 
 Marcus! 
 If you can hear me, shoot her! 
 (demonic yelling) 
 Shoot her now! 
 Tomas! 
 (demonic growling) 
 Do it. 
 (demon growls) 
 (panting) 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 (sirens wailing) 
 Inside. Inside! 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (pounding) 
 (officers shouting outside) 
 Over here. 
 There's nothing out here. 
 ROSE: I want to make one thing clear. 
 Andrew Kim was an amazing father. 
 I've known him since college. 
 And whatever happened, whatever he did, it doesn't change the fact that for six years, he loved those kids with all his heart. 
 OFFICER: That isn't really the issue, Miss Cooper. 
 Four people are dead. 
 I've got a room full of foster kids, all beat to hell, claiming they were attacked by their own father. 
 And you said that it started with this, uh... 
 Lorraine Graeme. 
 That's right. 
 She broke into the house and she held a knife to her own daughter's throat. 
 What Andy did was self-defense. 
 OFFICER: He disemboweled her. 
 
 
 
 ROSE: He was protecting his family. 
 OFFICER: And the neighbors? 
 Russ and Colleen Holstrom. 
 Was that also self-defense? 
 ROSE: Something happened to Andy after he killed Lorraine. 
 OFFICER: And then when you tried to take them off the island, that's when he got violent against the children. 
 ROSE: Yes. 
 Against you. 
 Yes. 
 But you didn't report the assault... or the murder of Miss Graeme. 
 I was trapped on an island with no power, no cell service, chased by a disturbed individual, with four traumatized kids in need of medical attention. 
 I thought the paperwork could wait. 
 I have to say what you did... took a lot of guts. 
 Those kids are alive because of you. 
 When can I see them? 
 HARPER: What's gonna happen to us? 
 They're gonna put us in homes. 
 Together? 
 It doesn't matter where they send us. 
 We're still a family. 
 ROSE: Okay, guys, they said we can go. 
 Thank you for watching them. 
 TOMAS: Of course. 
 Come on. 
 Rose. Um... 
 Before he died, he gave me a message for the kids... 
 ...and for you. 
 What kind of message? 
 He said that every kiss was real. 
 From the party in college to the first night Harper came to stay. 
 He should have told you how he felt, what you meant to him, but he hopes you knew it anyway. 
 What did he say? 
 He said tell the kids that... 
 Nikki and I loved them. 
 (chuckles softly) 
 We loved them all so damn much. 
 Tell Truck, never forget that he is smarter and kinder than anyone gives him credit for. 
 And just because sometimes people don't see that doesn't mean it's not true. 
 Tell Harper, don't let anyone tell you that anything's wrong with you because you are perfect in every way. 
 And, um, even though you weren't in my house for long, you will always be my daughter. 
 Caleb... 
 ...I am in awe of your courage and the fact that you can still face the world with a smile on your face makes me love you... 
 (laughs) all the more. 
 Shelby... 
 I know... you did everything you could to protect our family. 
 You were strong when I was weak and you were brave when it mattered. 
 Ah, God, I'm so proud to call you my son. 
 And tell Verity... 
 ...tell Verity that she changed our lives when she came to stay. 
 She saved us. 
 Tell them that it doesn't matter where you came from. 
 Every one of you is gonna go to do amazing things and live amazing lives. 
 And even though he may not be there to see it happen, you will always... 
 ...always be a part of me. 
 Andy died to stop the demon from hurting anyone ever again. 
 I hope you know your father was a hero. 
 Yeah. We know. 
 (sniffles) 
 ROSE: Thank you. 
 Come on, guys. 
 (sniffles) 
 How is he? 
 You should talk to him. 
 (cupboard opens, closes) 
 We can leave whenever you're ready. 
 I'm not going. 
 What? 
 You can't do this job if you're compromised. 
 I learned that a long time ago. 
 I took a man's life. 
 I'm unworthy. 
 No. 
 Andy knew there was no coming back. 
 He wanted you to stop the demon no matter the cost. 
 It's still murder. 
 Still a mortal sin. 
 Every sin can be forgiven. 
 There are rules in place for a reason. 
 We maintain purity, we don't harm the innocent, we put duty before self. 
 How many lives... will be saved because of Andy's sacrifice? 
 Because of what you did? 
 I don't regret pulling the trigger. 
 But I can't pretend it never happened. 
 It's been a long time since... since I heard God's voice, or... felt His touch. 
 And now, I don't feel anything at all. 
 How can I be a vessel for His grace when, in that moment... 
 I rejected His love? 
 I was so close to saving him. 
 I could have done it. 
 But you'd have been lost. 
 It was a sacrifice I was willing to make. 
 I wasn't. 
 Marcus, Marcus. 
 I, I... 
 I don't know how to do this without you. 
 You'll learn. 
 You're an exorcist. 
 You put your trust in God. 
 No one else. 
 Until the next time. 
 Adios, hermano. 
 Not forever. 
 Just for now. 
 For now. 
 You've come a long way... little church mouse. 
 Keep an eye on him. 
 Don't let him drive. 
 He's rubbish at it. 
 (laughs softly) 
 I will. 
 Take care of yourself. 
 You, too. 
 Tomas. 
 (sighs) 
 It's-it's fine. Uh... 
 He does this sort of thing, yeah. 
 He'll come back. 
 I don't think so. 
 I cannot do this alone. 
 You don't have to. 
 If God brought you to Marcus to help start your journey, maybe he sent me to you to help you finish it. 
 I believe in you, Tomas. 
 And I believe there's more work to be done. 
 Will you help me? 
 You know, we're being hunted by the single largest, richest, and most powerful organization in the history of mankind. 
 I'm not afraid. 
 I had a good teacher. 
 (engine starts) 
 (ventilator pumping) 
 (demonic whispering) 
 (demonic whispering continues) 
 * 
 * 
 (indistinct announcement over P.A.) 
 (lock buzzes) 
 Am I allowed to hug her? 
 ROSE: Yes. 
 You're allowed. 
 TRUCK: I miss him. 
 Me, too. 
 How are you holding up? 
 I can't sleep. 
 They don't turn the lights off, and no one talks to me. 
 What if I told you, I might have found a home for you? 
 It's temporary. 
 But maybe one day, it will be permanent. 
 Really? 
 ROSE: You have to promise me something. 
 This is a brand-new foster parent. 
 Never done it before. 
 So you're gonna have to be really patient with her, okay? 
 Okay. 
 So what do you think? 
 It's nice. 
 This is your house? 
 Would that be okay? 
 (indistinct chatter nearby) 
 SHELBY: You know what I'm saying? 
 -Just don't hurt yourself, okay? -VERITY: I'm not. 
 SHELBY: Are you sure you don't need any help? 
 'Cause you're gonna fall. 
 VERITY: Dude, I got this. 
 Don't call me dude, bro. 
 Truck. 
 -CALEB: Truck! -Guys, I missed you. 
 Oh, oh, oh, no, ah, no. 
 -(all shouting, laughing) -Truck's just too big. 
 -TRUCK: Okay, whoa. -(shouting, laughing continues) 
 TRUCK: Oh, God! I'm-I'm down. 
 -I missed you guys. -CALEB: Missed you, too. 
 -TRUCK: Ah. -HARPER: You got bigger. 
 TRUCK: I love you. 
 MAN: Slip 14, you'll see it. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 MAN: You know, that's what I don't understand. 
 How you feeling, man? I'm ready to go home. 
 Hey, fellas. How's it going? 
 No catch for me... 
 (indistinct chatter continues) 
 (low rumbling) 
 (gasps) 
 (panting) 
 (high-pitched ringing) 
 (whispering): Yes. 
 I can hear you. 
 I'm listening. 
 Tomas. 
 Now that you're good and scared by The Exorcist, here are a few more shows to check out from Fox. 
 * Hey-ay-ay *
