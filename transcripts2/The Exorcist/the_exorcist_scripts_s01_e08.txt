 Previously on The Exorcist... 
 What do you want from me? 
 Quit pretending. 
 You know perfectly well what you must do. 
 Bring her to me. 
 (sizzling) 
 How's Jim? 
 I moved out. 
 There's a place where I'm not married and you're not a priest. Leave everything else outside. 
 You're so special. 
 Let me touch you. 
 Let me touch you... 
 Come on. 
 Maria : Your Eminence, and Father Bennet. 
 So happy to have you. 
 Bennett : Tattersal Landscaping. 
 Perhaps you'd like to explain to me how a defunct landscaping company funnels nearly $3 million into a papal planning committee. 
 (grunting) 
 (screams) 
 The Devil in my Daughter. 
 Talk show host : What happened to you in Georgetown? 
 Regan : I remember that I couldn't control my body sometimes. 
 There was just this voice. 
 That's all I remember. 
 What happened in that room... 
 I can't... remember. 
 (growling) 
 So that your child may be born again! 
 (rumbling) 
 Help me. (gasps) 
 (yelling): Mother Bernadette! 
 (growling) 
 Marcus : Four decades ago, it had Regan's body and it lost it. 
 That is a demon with a 40-year grudge. 
 You're asking me to lie. 
 God is in me. Yeah, lie.

 Casey... 
 Why didn't you tell me you found her? 
 That's my daughter. 
 Only part of her. 
 (grunts) 
 Angela : I'm her mother. 
 Casey? 
 (demonic voice): Rags. 
 Bloody rags. 
 Casey, I know you can hear me. 
 I know you're in there. 
 Baby, you have to stay strong. 
 (door opens) 
 Nun : I'm sorry, you can't go in there. 
 Henry : Get out of our way. 
 Katherine : Let us in. 
 Nun : I'm sorry, you're gonna have to hold back. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Casey... 
 You need to get this family out of here right now. 
 You need to get out of my face right now. 
 (demonic voice): Mother MacNeil. 
 Someone got old. 
 (normal voice): Kat? 
 I knew you'd come. 
 Are you here to take me home? 
 Yeah. Just as soon as you're better, we're gonna take you back. 
 (demonic voice): You're a terrible driver. 
 What? 
 Just walk away, Katherine. 
 Almost ran me over when you ogled that ginger whore's breasts. 
 Only one in your company with any talent, and you obliterated it for a little lesbo curiosity. 
 It's not her. 
 Casey (normal voice) : Kat, look at me. 
 Get away, Kat. 
 (demonic voice): Is that you speaking, Daddy Dimwit? 
 Casey, honey... 
 Duh, duh, duh, Dad. 
 Did you string those words, Dad, into a sentence all by yourself, Dad? 
 Head buried in blueprints while I unscrewed that screw, and sent the scaffolding down, down, down, duh, duh, duh, Dad? 
 (growls) 
 (grunts) 
 (Katherine shrieks) 
 (panting) 
 Mother Bernadette : "The glorious Mother of God, the Virgin Mary, "commands you to flee. We have come to crush your proud head..."

 Get the hell out of my child. 
 (demonic voice): Hell? 
 Do you know what Hell is, Regan? 
 It's where Casey is right now. 
 (door closes) 
 In a room with no windows, nailed to the floor, surrounded by nothing. 
 Alone forever. 
 Knowing it was her mother who put here there. 
 But don't worry. 
 There's room for you, too.

 Marcus and Tomas  (distant): God surrounds us. 
 The love of God enfolds us. 
 The power of God protects us. 
 Henry : We should be in there. 
 They're trying to save her. 
 We should be allowed to... 
 (thump) 
 What's the word? What's the damn word? 
 Watch. 
 Monitor! We should be allowed to monitor what is going on. 
 How can you be so calm about this? 
 How can you just sit there and be calm? 
 I'm a lot of things right now, but calm is not one of them. 
 This was the hardest part. 
 And Father Maren barred me from the room. 
 You're left on the outside and you have to listen to all those sounds. 
 Yeah? How'd that work out for Father Maren? 
 Honey. 
 What? 
 I need you to go home and start packing for us. 
 Oh, like hell. Like hell I am. 
 We're not leaving her here. 
 Angela : We're not. 
 I'm gonna be here. 
 I'm gonna get her back. 
 And when this is over, when... when this works, it's gonna be bad for Casey. 
 Just like it was for me. 
 (loud thump) 
 The police, the... the media, everything. 
 You don't want to put her through that, do you? 
 No. 
 (exhales) So, we need you to be able to... pick up and get the hell out of town. 
 All right? Can you do that for me? 
 Just... 
 ...don't... don't let them hurt her. 
 Never. 
 Call us, if anything changes.

 Female reporter : Mr. Rance!

 Chris : Get out of her face! 
 Get them to back off. 
 Chris : Leave her alone. 
 Mr. Rance, where is your daughter? Mr. Rance, please. 
 (car door opens, engine starts) 
 (tires screech) 
 Female reporter : Is Casey inside the building? 
 (excited chatter) 
 Reporters : Where is Casey? 
 You are trespassing on private property. 
 You are creating a hostile environment for the sisters who are cloistered here. 
 As head of this priory, I request that all of you leave. 
 Otherwise, I will be forced to call the police, and... 
 We're already here. 
 I would like these people to leave. 
 Uh, public sidewalks, so unless someone commits a specific crime, there isn't a whole lot we can do. 
 It's an unlawful gathering. 
 Look, why don't you let me come in, take a quick look around, we can tell all these nice people there's nothing to see here, everyone goes home. 
 Do you have a warrant? 
 I was hoping we didn't need one, Sister. 
 It's Mother. 
 Five minutes, we'll be out of your hair. 
 (bell tolls) 
 Ah. Would you look at that? 
 You don't want to do that... 
 (door opens) 
 (sirens wailing in distance) 
 (beeping) 
 (inhales sharply): Ugh. 
 Lester : Oh, quit squirming. It's barely been punctured. 
 (grunts) Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Have you ever been stabbed before? 
 Myrtle Beach, 1974. 
 Ate two tabs of brown clown in the parking lot after a supremely disappointing ELO quote unquote "concert." 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I'd like to report the discovery of human remains. 
 Um... probably like... (large vehicle rumbling past) a dozen? Yeah, a dozen. 
 Well, they wouldn't be remains if they weren't dead, would they? 
 Tattersal Landscaping at Overton and 11th. 
 Boiler room. 
 Check the boiler room. 
 Tattersal. T-A-T-T-E-R-S-A-L. 
 Sure. I'll hold. 
 (beeps) 
 Let me call. 
 I do a bang-up '40s gumshoe. 
 (cracks) 
 Marcus (distant) : Strike terror, Lord, into the beast now laying waste to your vineyard. 
 Fill your servants with courage to fight manfully against that reprobate dragon... 
 Marcus... 
 ...lest he despise those who put their trust in you... 
 It's not working. It wants Angela. 
 All the more reason to keep her away. 
 You saw how it woke when she was in here. 
 She could help us draw the demon out. Bait the whale. 
 Marcus : You never give a demon what it wants. 
 (squishing, squeaking) 
 Why not? Why not give it to her? 
 You disobeyed my direct order. 
 I don't take orders from you. 
 Well you should, 'cause you're gonna get her killed. 
 Well, I'm not the one with blood on my hands. 
 No, you're not, 'cause you're not an exorcist. 
 And you're not a priest.

 Ugh!

 Angela beat it once. 
 It's a risk. 
 ...blessed is the fruit of thy womb...

 Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, (footsteps) pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. 
 Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done... 
 I'm ready. 
 I can't emphasize enough the risk you're taking. 
 Don't think a 40-year absence will protect you. 
 I know this thing better than anyone. 
 If you feel it poking around at all, even the slightest twinge, you run. 
 Drop everything and run.

 Mother Bernadette : ...all wretched powers... all wicked legions... 
 (continues praying quietly) 
 (exhales) 
 (chains rattling) 
 All infernal invaders... 
 (demonic voice): Hello, Mommy. 
 (sizzling) 
 You're not my daughter. 
 (sizzling) 
 That's right. 
 Your daughter's dead. 
 Isn't that what you told Padre? 
 What kind of mother gives up hope that easily? 
 Tomas and Mother Bernadette : All Satanic powers... 
 (moaning) 
 All wicked legions... 
 I liked you better as a soloist. 
 Hiding behind a civilian, Marcus? 
 Marcus : Keep it talking. 
 About what? 
 The more mundane, the better. 
 Words don't matter. 
 Yes, Mother. 
 Distract me. 
 Do... do you remember when you broke your foot? 
 Riveting. 
 Ah. 
 (groaning) 
 Keep on with it. 
 You had a play date. You were at, uh, you were at Saylor's house. 
 And you were climbing a tree in the backyard, the oak. 
 And one of the branches snapped, and you fell. 
 Good. Keep talking. 
 You fell. Uh, your foot... 
 Casey, you broke your foot. 
 You thought about it, didn't you? 
 When she was born. 
 Couldn't wait to rip her from your teat like a sickly kitten. 
 Angela : And you didn't cry. 
 You didn't even call home. 
 Which is what you really should have done. 
 You just... you just started walking. 
 Suppose it's my fault... for stretching you out. 
 Leaving a hole that nothing could ever quite fill. 
 You walked home. 
 All three blocks. 
 And you didn't cry. 
 Not even once. 
 On a broken foot, you walked. 
 Not Henry. 
 Not your daughters. 
 Bet she didn't tell you... she scraped the first one out. 
 And that's when... that's, that's when... 
 Worried it would come out like her. 
 ...I knew. 
 Rotten. Filthy. 
 I knew! 
 Putrid. 
 I knew that no matter what life threw you, Casey, that you would be okay. 
 Devil of lies. 
 Angela : Because you are strong. 
 You are stronger... 
 ...monster. 
 ...than I could ever be. 
 Give way to Christ. 
 Casey! 
 Tomas : Give way, you monster. 
 I forgive you, fallen angel. 
 (sizzling) 
 (groaning) 
 None of your works. 
 Marcus : I forgive you, fallen angel. 
 I forgive you, fallen angel. 
 I forgive you, fallen angel. 
 I forgive you, fallen angel. 
 Mother Bernadette : Child of God, you are forgiven. 
 (growling) 
 Walk into the light.

 Marcus : ...you have no authority, but that which is given. 
 Following up on the gruesome discovery of an as-yet undisclosed number of corpses at a decommissioned warehouse in the Bronzeville neighborhood. 
 At a press conference... 
 News anchor : ...not to jump to any conclusions. 
 ...they are narrowing down a group of suspects and hope to have the perpetrator or perpetrators in custody in the very near future. 
 Just whatever you need for the next few weeks, okay? 
 What's the rush? It's not like we're gonna be able to move with the state that Casey's in. 
 I mean, you saw how sick she looks. 
 She's gonna need doctors, medication. 
 Do we even know where the hell we're moving to? 
 Guelph. 
 Guelph? 
 Yeah, it's outside Toronto. 
 Canada. 
 Who the hell lives in Canada? 
 I got in touch with an old friend. 
 So we run away and what, just hope everyone magically forgets that Casey killed two people? 
 That was the demon. That was not your sister! 
 I know. 
 Um, I've got a house in Palm Springs. 
 It's a little, four-bedroom place. 
 I bought it as a winter home. 
 I haven't lived there in years. 
 There's a renter. I can boot him out. 
 It's quiet and it's private. 
 No, they'll find us. 
 Even if we get her back, they're gonna arrest her. 
 They can find her in Canada, too. 
 Do you have a summer home in Venezuela? 
 I hear that's where criminals go. 
 She's not a criminal. 
 I know, but you just said she's gonna get arrested. 
 Not a lot of dance schools in Guelph, I'm guessing. 
 Henry, you've got to think of both daughters at this point. 
 We're not splitting up this family. 
 
 
 
 I'm not going back to school. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Honey, now, it's lousy timing but I'm putting it out there. 
 Don't. 
 I've made up my mind.

 ...one baptism, one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in all.

 (overlapping voices): One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all... who is over all and through all... 
 (groaning) 
 "Who was over all, and through all and in all." 
 Just as you were called... 
 (groaning) 
 (wheezing) 
 ...one baptism, one God and (growling) ...Father of all, who is over all... and through all and in all. There is one God and one...

 (demonic yelling) 
 (groaning) ...one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all... 
 Angela : One faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. 
 But grace was given to each... 
 ...one of us, according to the measure of Christ's gift. 
 (demonic voice): The things I could tell you about Christ's gift. 
 What are you doing? 
 Let's play a game, Mother. 
 Just you and me.

 Captain Howdy?

 Salesman : Mm, no. 
 Regan : Captain Howdy, that's not very nice. 
 You. 
 How am I gonna have a new dad if my mom never finds someone? 
 Still haven't found Daddy, have we? 
 Nice to see you all grown up, though. 
 It's been a minute. 
 You were the photographer, at the zoo. 
 And you were six. 
 You took my picture. 
 That was the first time I saw... 
 Watch the birdie. 
 (camera flashes)

 Why are you making me watch this? 
 I thought you didn't remember most of it. 
 Consider this a refresher, a stroll down memory lane.

 You down there? 
 (Regan's voice): Yeah, Mom. I'm fine. 
 Geez.

 You own mother called you Stinkpot. 
 I gave you memories. 
 Do you know what's my favorite memory of you? 
 Mm... 
 This... right here. 
 My sweet, my dear... 
 My Regan MacNeil. 
 The girl that got away. 
 Look what you've done to her, to me! 
 Do you remember how much pleasure you were feeling at this moment? 
 The gates I unlocked for you. 
 Past. 
 I ruined men for you. Say it. 
 That isn't true. 
 Oh, yes. Henry? Virility personified. 
 Why did you choose me? 
 "Why me"? 
 "Why me"? 
 Who are you? 
 You expect me to say you have some gift, some ability, something that sets you apart and makes you special? 
 You were chosen? 
 There are close to eight billion human beings crawling this earth... you're like vermin. "Why me?" 
 Because you were under my foot, you stupid bitch. 
 (chuckles) "Why me?" 
 I will say this. 
 It has good vintage, your whine. 
 Even your Christ on his cross screamed out, "Why me?" like it was poetry. 
 "Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?" 
 He was screaming in pain and shouting, "Damn you! 
 Why me?" 
 Leave my family alone! 
 No. 
 Forgot that, did you? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Because you don't get to walk away. 
 Not after what you did. 
 Besides... I miss your taste. 
 Ah! Oh... 
 Ahh. 
 Oh! 
 You're different now. 
 You taste like... death. 
 (door opens) 
 Chris : Rags? Rags? 
 Yoo-hoo. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 What you doing down here? 
 Oh, jeez. 
 Where'd you get that thing? 
 Listen, go up and say hi to Burke. 
 He'd love to see you. Yeah? 
 What's the matter? 
 (gasps): Oh, I didn't tell you. 
 (chuckles) 
 Guess what? Your momma is gonna be a great big movie director. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, maybe not big, but they sent over this script, and they want me to direct one-third of it. 
 It's like this triptych thing. 
 What do you think? Should I do it? 
 It's called "Hope." Come on up. 
 Come upstairs, and I'll let you have half a glass of wine.

 Marcus : You have no will but that which is given. 
 You have no authority but that which is given.

 Return to the shadow, viper! 
 You have no hold on this woman. 
 Child of God, you are forgiven. 
 You are loved. You are perfect and whole. 
 There is no place for you here. 
 Marcus! 
 (gasping, banging continue) 
 Yeah, worth a shot. 
 Oh, my God, I'm heartily sorry for having offended Thee. 
 And I detest all my sins. 
 (demonic voice): Last rites, priest? 
 Giving up on the piglet so soon? 
 The last rites aren't for Casey, they're for you. 
 Because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of Hell. 
 All : But most of all because they offend Thee, my God, who are all good and deserving of all my love. 
 Sorry, Mommy, show's over. 
 Time to give the people what they want.

 Marcus : Angela, get back! 
 Casey, stay with me! 
 Angela, please! 
 Stay with me! 
 Casey, no!

 Casey! 
 I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life! 
 Amen. 
 He has borne our weakness and endured our suffering. 
 He will reward you with eternal life. 
 I confess to Almighty God, and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned, in my thoughts and in my words. 
 In what I have done and what I have failed to do. 
 Through my fault! 
 Through my fault! 
 Through my most grievous fault.
