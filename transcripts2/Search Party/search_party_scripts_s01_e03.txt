 There's a beeping sound that if... if a car gets too close, you'll hear a beep. 
 Don't panic. It's just alerting you. 
 Okay. 
 So, Gail, thank you again so, so, so much. 
 Uh, I promise we'll take good care of it, okay? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 Of course! 
 I'm just glad it gets to see the world instead of sulking in this garage all weekend, like me. [Laughs nervously] 
 We'll have it back by tonight. 
 Gail gets it. 
 It's the "under-30 club" in this car tonight. 
 No! 
 No old people! 
 No. No, you're not old. 
 It's... It's, uh, it's actually not even that that, like, fun a trip. 
 We're going to a vigil, so... 
 Oh, I don't want to go. 
 Right. 
 I just don't have anything to do. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Dory : God, they're all dressed up, huh? 
 Hi! 
 Hey, guys! I have to sit in the front. 
 I'm so sorry. I just, you know, my equilibrium, I will... I'll throw up. 
 Yeah. Don't worry about it. 
 Thank you. Thank you. Hi! 
 Hey, Portia. 
 Hey, Drewski. 
 What's up? 
 You guys know this isn't, like, a fancy cocktail party, right? 
 Dory, look me in the eye and tell me you know what to wear to a vigil. 
 Exactly. 
 Oh, my God. This lumbar support... 
 It's so good for my back. 
 I got penetrated last night. 
 Nice. 
 [Giggles] 
 S01E03  The Night of One Hundred Candles 
 Dora : "Happy families are all alike. 
 "Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." 
 Aww! 
 Okay... 
 Chantal highlighted that. 
 Isn't that compelling? 
 Isn't that the first line of the book? 
 I mean, like, why would you have to highlight the first line? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe it just, like, spoke to her. 
 It's gonna be interesting to see who's there, you know, and who's not there, and who's upset, who's not upset. 
 Elliott : Mm-hmm. Dory, are you gonna give a speech about the one-and-only interaction you ever had with Chantal? 
 Uh, yeah, I was. 
 Do you want to come up with me and talk about how much you thought she sucked? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 You guys know that Elliott's only going to this because Leslie owes him $20, right? 
 And I'm gonna get it back. 
 How'd that happen? 
 Okay, so senior year, we went ice skating, and, um, somehow Leslie got a whiff of our plans. 
 And it was cash-only, everyone knew that. 
 And she was, like, "Can you pay for me?" 
 And she was like, "You know, I'll pay you back, I'll pay you back!" 
 I'm like, "Sure, honey." Anyway, the point is, smash cut to five years later, there's no money, and I'm gonna lift the curse tonight. 
 Wow. That's stealing. 
 Thank you. 
 Portia : [Exhales sharply] 
 Okay, remember, if we see Kimsey Gordon, tell her about "Surviving Essex." 
 Elliott : Oh, I'm ready. Trust me. [Giggles] 
 Portia : And make sure that she knows that I'm series recurring. 
 I don't think she's gonna care about the specifics of the contract, you know? 
 Yes, Elliott, but she still talks to Bella. 
 It's gonna destroy Bella. 
 You guys, be quiet. Shh. Shh. 
 Portia : Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Elliott : Jesus Christ, we know. 
 [Sarcastically] Thanks, Mom.

 [Violin plays somber song] 
 Candles for Chantal. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thank you. 
 God, it's so sad they didn't get, like, real candles for her. 
 I think it's touching, you know? 
 Yeah, me too. 
 I mean, we're, like, community. 
 It's hard to, like... 
 Hey, baby, who is that? 
 Oh! Hi. 
 It's Agnes Cho. 
 She was in our dorm freshman year. 
 Yeah, she's the one always hanging it over everyone's heads that she works with apes. 
 Agnes : Hi, guys! 
 Oh, my God. Hey, girl! 
 [Chuckles] It's so good to see you. 
 It's just so sad that it has to be under these circumstances. 
 I know. Thank you so much for coming. 
 Of course. 
 I'm surprised to see you guys, but I know Chantal would be so happy to know you were here for her. 
 Of course. 
 Yeah. 
 When was the last time that you... that you saw her? 
 That's the worst part. 
 I haven't seen her in weeks. 
 We kept trying to get it together to watch a IMAX, but I kept canceling because of work. 
 Mm. 
 Portia : Yikes. 
 I work with apes at the Bronx zoo. 
 Oh, cool. 
 Sometimes I love my job so much, it just gets in the way of everything else. 
 Me, too. I feel that same way about my job as well. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm sorry. Do you remember Drew and Portia? 
 Um, hello? How could I forget Drew? 
 [Laughs] Huh? 
 What? 
 Oh, please. 
 Don't act like you don't remember Chantal's big crush on you. 
 I thought you didn't know her. 
 I... 
 Yeah, I don't. 
 And do you remember me? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 [Violin music plays] 
 So, you really don't remember anything about Chantal having a crush on you, really? 
 I mean, for real, and I feel bad saying this, especially here, but, like, I don't remember her at all. 
 Drew, did you kill Chantal? 
 [Chuckles] 
 No. 
 Portia : [Snorts] 
 It's fine if you did. 
 Portia : I'm so sorry. 
 I'd be on your side. 
 No, I didn't kill Chantal. 
 We'd like to thank everyone so much for coming out tonight for Chantal. 
 Portia : Ohh. 
 The amount of love and compassion... 
 You guys, her mom looks so sad. 
 That you have shown us in this last week has... 
 It's been extraordinary. 
 I'm gonna tell the parents. 
 Oh, no. I don't think that's a very good idea. 
 No, it's just... how can I let them mourn like that when I know that she's still alive? 
 Don't worry about that. Okay. 
 I think you should tell them... 
 Father : Also, I've been asked to announce some hashtags for tonights vigil. 
 Uh... "Pound sign come home Chantal," and "Pound sign [Sniffs] "I am Chantal." 
 Uh... All right. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Kathryn Witherbottom, Chantal's sister. 
 She disappeared the day of my bridal shower. 
 I sent her out for cupcakes, and... 
 [Voice breaking] And it's my fault. 
 I should have just let her enjoy the day. 
 [Sobs] 
 Emotions running high tonight, understandably. 
 Uh, hello. 
 I'm Ted, Kathryn's fiancé. 
 Chantal was like a little sister to me. 
 Woman : Is. 
 [All murmur] 
 Right, of course, "Is." 
 And he's the one who killed Chantal. 
 Ted : Anyway, uh... 
 Elliott : I mean... 
 Now we have a... a very special performance from Chantal's college a cappella group the Choral Fixation. 
 Both : Five, six, seven, eight...

 [Light applause] 
 That was taken minutes before she jumped out of the bridge Uhm. 
 We were vacationing in Maine, and Chantal found this little brochure for bungee jumping. 
 Couldn't get it out of her head so I... took my little girl bungee jumping. 
 [Both small laughs] 
 Did she... 
 Did you like it? 
 I'm glad I had the experience. 
 Turned out to be a little bit to much for Chantal, she got whiplash, stayed in bed for the rest of the trip. 
 Blaming me for the whole thing. 
 Well it was nice meeting you. 
 Oh, uhm, I'm sorry. Can I... 
 Can I just you something? 
 Just... 
 Have you heard anything from... the Police? 
 No, unfortunately nothing yet. 
 No? 
 They haven't told you if anyone's come in and hum... shared a story, or...? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Bob? Excuse me. 
 I hate to bother but... there is a car blocking Susan's car. 
 It's a white volvo. 
 Do you know who's it is? 
 That's Jannet Sunberry Thank you for coming Come on. 
 Yeah. 
 No, um, it's more of a charity project, kind of a grassroots coalition type of thing. 
 After the cancer, I felt like I had to pay the world back, if that makes any sense? 
 I'm sorry. You know about my history with cancer, right, you know? 
 Yes, and you're so brave. 
 Oh, thank you so much, but you don't have to say that. 
 Anyway, we're making these designer water bottles, and for every one that we sell in the States, we're actually gonna give one to one of the African villages in need, so... 
 So... I'm sorry. 
 But obviously the problem in Africa is not that they don't have water  bottles. 
 It's, like, that they don't have  water. 
 Believe me, I know. 
 And we will also always set aside a percentage of our proceeds, and some of that we're gonna share with the villages, Leslie, so... 
 So, like, a percentage of the percentage? 
 Okay, see, I actually love this, because it's all about, like, starting a conversation, creating dialogue, like, beginning to talk. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Yeah. 
 How you holding up? 
 I'm very sad. 
 Yeah, it's sad. 
 So, I'm sorry. 
 What... What do you do? 
 Oh, I'm an actress. 
 I knew it! I knew it. 
 I was... I was gonna say actress or model. 
 Really? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I think you really stand out in this crowd. 
 [Giggles] Yeah, I know. 
 Drew : Wait, so what's the difference between apes and monkeys? 
 Agnes : Were you joking? 
 Yeah. 
 Excuse me for one sec. 
 For sure. Sorry about that. 
 No, it's just... 
 I understand. 
 [Both laugh] 
 
 
 
 Hey, Julian. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 It's a little hypocritical that you're here, don't you think? 
 Okay, okay. Before you start, I am only here because Gabe made me come. 
 And you remember him, he was actual friend of Chantal's? 
 Okay, you know, Gabe was friends with everybody. 
 Oh, really? 
 Yeah, you know that. 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 I got the Venmo for the dry cleaning. 
 Thanks. 
 Good. Good. 
 Good, good, good, good. 
 [Clears throat] 
 This house is crazy, huh? It's so nice. 
 This is awkward. 
 Oh, come on. No, we can all hang out. 
 It's fine. 
 No. 
 I mean, the fact that I'm at this vigil for a girl that I don't even know. 
 I feel like I'm intruding. 
 Yeah, it is weird. 
 It's almost like, um, "What are we doing here?" 
 Now you're making me feel bad. 
 I don't do anything to help people. 
 Oh... Oh, my God. Don't even worry about it. 
 I go to every town hall meeting that I can. 
 That's an incredible start, Leslie. 
 But you could also, um... 
 I mean, go with me here... 
 You could also donate $20 to, like, my charity. 
 I will think about it. 
 You have to. 
 I play a frisky rookie cop named Courtney Garcia with super sensitive hearing. 
 Wow! 
 I love... I love how on TV the... the cops are always hot. 
 Right. 
 Well, everyone on the show is very attractive. 
 [Humming] 
 So, let me ask you. 
 What's it like to, um, have to do a s*x scene? 
 I mean, do you ever... get turned on, or do you feel like it's just a day at the office, right? 
 Hi. Hey, babe. 
 Babe, we're just talking about what a nightmare this whole situation is. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm sorry this is... 
 Hi, I'm Portia. 
 Miranda, Chuck's wife. 
 Hi, it's nice to meet... 
 You have pretty hair. 
 Oh. 
 How do you guys know Chantal? 
 She was our nanny. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, my gosh. This sucks for you guys. 
 It's a tough night. 
 Yeah. 
 Speaking of, should we go check on the kids, babe? 
 I think so. 
 Yeah. 
 Do your thing. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. Take care. Okay. 
 Yes, goodbye. 
 Um, I-I'm right downtown if, you know, you're ever around. 
 Okay. 
 I've been trying to reach Jane Goodall recently, and she's really hard to find. 
 I can imagine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
 I e-mailed, like, this e-mail on her website, and I, like, messaged all the message boards, but no one's getting back to me. 
 I mean, like... 
 Agnes, I'm sorry. 
 Um, is that, uh, Chantal's boyfriend? 
 [Cellphone vibrates] 
 Hang on. 
 Gavin, right? 
 Oh, ex-boyfriend. 
 They broke up a couple months ago. 
 Oh. 
 Do you know what happened? 
 No, but it was sudden. 
 I thought they were gonna get married. 
 Hmm. 
 She didn't tell you anything else about, like, what happened between them, or... 
 You know, she didn't really talk about things like that. 
 I mean, I'm super open about talking about my feelings and s*x and stuff, but she wasn't like that. 
 I guess people are different. 
 So, I see you and Dory are still a thing. 
 Yeah, I didn't take your advice. 
 Hey, do... 
 Julian? Oh, my God. 
 You look [bleep] amazing! [Giggles] 
 Uh, random question... 
 Are you still writing for any of those media outlets? 
 Yeah, yeah. Sometimes. 
 Yeah. 
 Julian : Why, what's up? Hmm? 
 Oh, I was just... This is so gross. 
 Are you open to hearing a new pitch? 
 Do you want to talk, or... 
 No, but go ahead. 
 I don't want you e-mailing me. 
 Okay, um, you know when you're thirsty...

 ♪ 
♪ Ambiance music ♪ 
 Excuse me, Mrs. Witherbottom. 
 I'm sorry to bother you. 
 Um, my name's Dory. 
 I went to school with Chantal, and, um, I wanted to tell you that, um, I saw her. 
 I saw your daughter... 
 What? 
 At a Chinese restaurant. 
 You had dinner with her? When? 
 No, I-I wasn't with her, but I-I tried to talk to her, and she left this book at the restaurant. 
 Chantal hates Chinese food. 
 She wasn't eating, really. 
 She was just there, and... 
 I don't understand. 
 Was... Was this in college? 
 Is this a book from college? 
 No, no. 
 Um, I want to tell you that she's out there. 
 She's alive. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Where... Where is she? 
 Okay. 
 What are you saying? 
 That I... 
 Do you... Do you know where she is? 
 [Voice breaking] No, not exactly. 
 You don't know where she is? 
 No, but I saw her. 
 Where is she?! 
 She was in Flushing when I saw her. 
 Hey... Hey, this woman hasn't slept in days. 
 Give her some space. 
 I was just trying to tell her something. 
 And what is your name. 
 Dory. 
 But I-I-I saw something. 
 I'm just trying to tell her what I saw. 
 Then call the hotline or tell the cops. 
 It's not helpful for you to be harassing a grieving mother, okay? 
 I have information, and I'm just trying to help her. 
 Well, you want to help? 
 Yeah. 
 Why don't you go around and clean up some of the disposable plates that people have been leaving everywhere? 
 That would be very helpful. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 That was so messed up. 
 I mean, what an asshole, right? 
 And now he's, like, hovering around them, so I can't even, like, talk to the dad. 
 Dory, I think we should go. 
 I feel like people are looking at us. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 I mean, it's not like I came all the way out here for nothing. 
 Elliott : Dory... I'm so sorry. 
 Julian was asking to do, like, a profile piece on me and, like, the whole water bottle venture, and I'm just wondering if, like, is that weird? 
 That's not what at all what happened, but okay. 
 What, Elliott? Yeah, it doesn't matter. 
 Could you try and help me with this situation right now, please. 
 Okay, you want a suspect? That guy. 
 What? 
 Yeah, Chantal used to nanny for him and his wife, and now he wants to... [Pops mouth] with [clicks tongue] 
 What? 
 Okay, similar colors to Chantal? 
 Sorry, he killed her. 
 Stop saying "Killed," okay? She's alive. 
 Dory, seriously, I don't want to be here anymore. 
 Portia : I want to go, too. 
 It's disrespectful. 
 There's nothing suspicious going on. 
 This is just a sad, sad thing that happened to some gal. 
 So, can we go? 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah, fine. 
 I-I'll meet you guys outside. I'm just gonna get my coat. 
 Gavin : There we go. 
 Enjoying the three-ring circus, my man? 
 Um... I'm sorry? 
 Chantal doesn't deserve all this. 
 You know, she's not even dead. 
 Oh, is that so? 
 Girl disappears for a moment, everyone acts like she's a saint. 
 I never saw her walk on water. 
 I know you. 
 Yeah. I think we went to school together. 
 You used to swim laps? 
 Yeah. Um, I used to. 
 Yeah... Yeah, you had good form. 
 Ah, that's sweet of you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Julian : Hey, Dory! 
 We're heading out. 
 Dory : Oh, okay. 
 Hey, hang... Hang in there, Gabe. 
 Hey, I heard that you think you saw Chantal. 
 I did. I did see her. 
 You should talk to someone about that. 
 Yeah, trust me, I'm trying. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 I mean, you should talk to someone professional. 
 I have some names if you need a rec. 
 Do you mean like a shrink? 
 No, I'm... I'm fine, Julian. 
 I don't even have insurance, so it doesn't... 
 You should really get insurance. 
 Okay, goodnight. Bye. 
 All right. Good night. 
 Yeah.

 I thought somebody inside had said that you guys were dating. 
 Yeah, well, we were dating... till we weren't. 
 Well, relationships are hard, so... 
 This whole thing's been one nightmare after another. 
 The cops and the press ask me question after question. 
 I don't even have a moment to myself to rub one out. 
 Cool, well, hang in there, pal. 
 I should probably go find my girlfriend Dory, so I think I'm gonna...
