 Look, I don't know how they got there. 
 They just appeared on my desk. 
 Okay. 
 Do you think maybe it's, like, a...a joke? 
 Look, whoever you sent these knows what we did. 
 It's not a joke. 
 It's a threat. 
 Honestly, all I could think of is...that maybe it's Chantal. 
 You know, maybe she was awake that night, and this is just her, like, weird way of trying to mess with us. 
 Yeah. I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 Well, have you asked her? 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 No, Dory. 
 I haven't asked her. 
 I don't really talk to her anymore. Okay? 
 Okay. I -- That's good to know. 
 I was just wondering. 
 Okay. 
 Look, I have to go. 
 What -- Oh, well, no. 
 We have to figure this out. 
 -Please, Dory. 
 -Yes. We will. 
 -Please. 
 -I promise. Okay? 
 Okay, Dory. I'm really sorry, but where are you going? 
 I'm going to get a -- a cavity filled. Okay? 
 I booked the appointment a really long time ago, and now it's today, so... 
 But you're dressed so nice. 
 I am? I -- [Scoffs] 
 I just threw it on. 
 It's, like, a wrap dress. 
 But you're in all black. 
 I mean, you're going to get spit all over it. 
 Listen, we'll take care of this later. Okay? 
 Whatever you do, don't tell Elliot and Portia. 
 They'll just freak out. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 We must protect them. 
 We must protect the little ones.

 You just so happen to hush as soon as I got here like a bunch of high schoolers? 
 [ Sarcastically ] No, Julian. 
 We think you're really cool. 
 -Oh, do you? 
 -Yeah. We do. 
 We think it's really, really cool that in your spare time... 
 [ Normal voice ] you're writing articles about lying bitches. 
 Yeah, because when a woman has been abused, like, she must be completely getting it wrong, like, she can't be trusted to tell the difference between a good time and violence. 
 Okay. No. No. No. 
 That is not at all what I was trying to say. 
 You make me sick. Shut up. 
 Okay. Look, look. That is not at all what I was trying to say. 
 If you just give me a chance... 
 I can't. I can't. 
 I can't. I'm sorry. 
 I just... 
 I can't listen to this. 
 -No. Just let me explain. 
 -I need to switch desks. 
 Uh, would somebody switch desks with me? 
 I need to get away from this person! 
 There are a lot of empty desks. 
 You don't need to mansplain to me about the desk situation. 
 Okay. Okay. If you just give me a chance to explain... 
 Julian, we need to talk later. 
 Absolutely.

 Okay. I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I kind of like the way that you're looking at me right now, but I really... 
 I really don't know what you're talking about. 
 I received flowers at my work. 
 There's a note in them. 
 I don't know who they're from. 
 Were they from you? 
 [ Scoffs ] Um, no, but now I'm kind of pissed because you called me here just to tell me that somebody at work is crushing on you? 
 That's, like, "Wow. Big deal, Drew." Not! 
 I'm really fragile right now. 
 You hurt me. 
 Did you even read that article that Julian wrote about me? 
 Ugh. He's such a misogynist. 
 Mm. 
 I wonder, do you, um... 
 Do you think maybe you hoped it was me that sent the flowers because you feel like we made a mistake cutting off our relationship too soon? 
 What? God. No. 
 Chantal. 
 Okay. I just want to know who sent the flowers. 
 That's all. Okay? 
 Fine. 
 It was me. 
 I was the one who sent you the flowers. 
 Is that what you wanted to hear? 
 You asshole! 
 -Oh! 
 -Oh! 
 Oh. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 So, like, I guess I fear the medication. 
 What is it you fear about the medication? 
 Well, I consider my mania a gift. 
 I'm an artist, and to be an artist is to be split open, which is hard for a lot of people, but so what? 
 I have my dark times, my blue days, but I'm actually a really happy person. 
 Can I just say that I don't trust anyone who says that they're happy? 
 -Carla... 
 -You have to suffer to survive. 
 I'm telling you this. You -- 
 Happiness does not exist. 
 Elliott, I saw you react to what Paz said. 
 Would you like to share your response to that? 
 Oh. No. 
 Okay. Would you be willing to share your fears? 
 I mean, it's very important for me to share my spirit, and I can be very passionate, and a lot of people can't handle that, and I can't handle it when that's threatened or tamed. 
 I don't like that. 
 Carla, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
 I just think he's saying nothing. 
 Does anyone know what he's talking about? 
 I don't even know what he's talking about.

 -Okay. Fine! Fine!

 Ron doesn't trust himself. 
 His first instinct is always his best, but whenever anyone ever challenges him, he questions everything and goes with the safe bet, and it's not working. 
 No, you're totally right, like, as a director, you're right. 
 It's so weird you brought him up because, like, I know this has nothing to do with his talent, but today, he, like, insinuated that we're sleeping together, and I was like, "No.

 Well, I mean, I can always find a solution. 
 You know, not necessarily the right one, but, you know, I pretty much always have a point of view. 
 I don't... 
 I don't experience doubt. 
 Okay. Can you give me an example? 
 Well... 
 Um... 
 There was a situation recently with some friends. 
 It was very...intense. 
 Okay. 
 Umm...One of my friends was attacked... by a seal. 
 A seal? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't know seals attacked people. 
 Yeah. They can be very territorial. 
 So sorry, but, please, go on. 
 Yeah. So, she and the seal had this scuffle, and it was, like, being very aggressive with her, and so my other friend had to, like... kill the seal. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah. 
 So, she killed the seal... 
 [ Chuckles nervously ] 
 ...and the thing is there's, like, very harsh punishment for hurting the seals in, um, Seal Bay. 
 So it became this thing of, like, do we call the water police, or do we get rid of it? 
 And everyone was looking to me with their, like, big, dumb eyes, like, "Elliott, you know, you're our leader. 
 Tell us what to do." 
 And, so, I was like, "I think we should get rid of it. 
 I think we should break his legs and put him in a suitcase and bury it." 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 But it's, like, that was just something that I said in the moment. 
 Okay. 
 But the problem is the seal was tagged, apparently, and, um, people think something weird happened, clearly, and now they're looking into it. 
 It's all just a huge f*cking mess, and the seal has, like, a daughter -- a daughter seal, and she, like, just found out, and she's, like, devastated, and she's grieving. 
 The point is I don't like taking on the responsibility of solving all my friends' problems. 
 It's not as fun as it looks, so... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Of course not. 
 God. 
 And how old were you when you came out? 
 I am so sorry, but, Elliott, you've got a phone call. 
 We're in a session, Janelle. 
 He said it was an emergency, and it couldn't wait. 
 -Ugh. I can't believe this. 
 -He's called like eight times.

 I certainly didn't mean to imply that all women who are in abusive relationships should be questioned.

 Maybe someone else will hire you.

 Is it true?

 It's true. 
 I know. [ Giggles ] 
 And then last year, I tried again in my dad's garage, and I turned the car on, and I was waiting there, and I was like, "Wait a minute. 
 Why haven't I passed out already?" 
 And I realized it's because my dad's garage door has a hole for his stupid dog, and the exhaust got out, and I'm like, "Oh, my God. 
 I can't even kill myself correctly." 
 It sounds like a cry for help, because if you really wanted to die, you would have checked the door. 
 I did want to die, Carla, but there was a hole for the doggy.
