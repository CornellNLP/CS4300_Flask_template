 Oh. [scoff] 
 Can I help you? 
 Oh! [chuckle] 
 Don't mind me. 
 I'm using my day to take pictures of people who look truly happy and I couldn't help but feel that you are so at peace. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, would you mind leaning back against the railing again and just think 
 "New York!" 
 [chuckle] 
 No, I'm good. 
 I appreciate it, though. 
 -Oh, okay. 
 -Yeah. 
 No! 
 Um... 
 Aah! 
 Help! No! 
 Oh! 
 [ Sobbing ] 
 Bitch! 
 I love you!

 I know we know him. 
 -No, I'm telling you, it's the guy that chartered a jet just to watch you scrape your foot with a Ped Egg on it. 
 -No. 
 That guy was teeny-tiny. 
 It's not him. 
 Huh. 
 Hey, um... are you guys medicated? 
 -Of course. 
 -My whole life. 
 That's -- that's good to know. 
 [chuckling] Yeah. 
 Just 'cause... 
 I feel like I've been having a hard time, just like, readjusting to everything. 
 Dory, can we just not? 
 Just wanna have a normal day, talking sh1t about strangers. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I think it's okay, though, that -- that we check in with each other, right? 
 Yeah, I love that. 
 I love that. I just -- 
 I'm sort of the philosophy right now where I think it's best to not think about it and keep moving forward and... that's working great for me, 'cause I've never been better. 
 Which is exactly why I'm trying to really just bury myself in working on my book right now. 
 Speaking of which, my editor is introducing me to my entire publishing team today. 
 And... they're considering turning my life into a board game. 
 Oh, my God! 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ Clink ] 
 Great. 
 I just keep Google- searching, like, [quietly] 
 "Montreal body found". 
 I mean, aren't you guys... a little freaked out about getting caught, like, any second? 
 You know, I read online it takes years to get over killing someone. 
 So the best we can do is just... carry on. 
 Right, I just -- 
 I don't... have anything to get back to. 
 I don't have a partner. 
 I don't have a home. 
 I... literally have less than I had before I started looking for Chantal. 
 But... 
 To look on the bright side, you found her. 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you for that. 
 Yeah, I... 
 I guess I just miss when my problems were about nothing. 
 What about Drew? 
 Have you seen him recently? 
 No.

 -Yeah. 
 -You want that? 
 It's not that different from New York, actually. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 Everything's Chinese there. 
 [ Both urinating ] 
 Yeah, but I am Chinese.

 Gail. 
 This isn't the easiest thing for me to say because, you know, when I quit, I... really wanted to...quit. 
 But, um... 
 I guess I'm just wondering... if there's any way I could just... come back and be your assistant again. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Dory, you're so sweet. 
 But I... 
 I can't. 
 Mmm. 
 [quietly] I don't -- 
 I don't have the funds. 
 Sorry, what? 
 I'm out of funds, Dory. 
 [raises voice] 
 I have no money. 
 I mean, how? 
 I-I-- Sorry, I just don't understand. 
 Like, I mean, is everything okay with Sundeep? 
 Oh, no, no. 
 Ha! Uh... 
 Sundeep says that my lack of awareness is a "liability" and that I could stay here as long as I want, but he needs to cut off all ties with me. 
 Oh, Gail. 
 I-I'm, I'm so sorry. 
 It's terrible. 
 It's so -- it seems so sudden. 
 Yeah, it was a few days ago -- 
 When you took the car, actually. 
 And then, apparently, later that evening, I... walked uptown and fell asleep on the steps of the Met. 
 I feel so guilty about the car. 
 No, stop! No! 
 -Okay. 
 Don't feel -- Please! 
 This is not about the car! 
 -Yeah. 
 -This is about me. 
 -Really. 
 -Well. 
 Drew and I also split up. 
 Oh, my God! 
 No, Dory! 
 -Yeah. 
 -I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 -Thanks. 
 -Ohhh. 
 We are gonna get through this, okay? 
 Let's just promise each other, all right? 
 Okay. I promise. 
 [snort] 
 Oh, look at us. 
 Two single women in their late 40s. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Tsk. 
 And this one was listed online as a Humphrey Wentletrap, but it's actually a Brown-band Wentletrap. 
 -[Crunching] 
 -Oh, that is gorgeous. 
 -Oh. 
 -Portia, look at this. 
 Portia! 
 Pay attention to Bing! 
 Oh, my gosh! 
 Beautiful shell. 
 So, Portia, tell me, are you acting in anything that has room for an aging John Garfield type, such as myself? 
 Oh, Bing, if I was working on anything, you would be the first to know. 
 -Aww. 
 -I don't know how she does it. 
 She takes after her father. 
 [sigh] 
 He could clip his toenails for 10 minutes and call it a full day. 
 No, I'm... 
 I'm going on auditions and stuff, like a totally normal, motivated person. 
 I have a really big one this week, actually. 
 And? 
 And I'm probably not gonna get it, because it's Elijah Clyde, so they're probably just looking for a name. 
 Elijah Clyde?! 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 -He's a big deal! 
 -Yeah. 
 -Who? 
 I swear, there's too many names in this world. 
 Yeah, I don't really know that much about it, other than it's, like, supposed to be very dark and has a Spanish name, so I'm probably going in because I'm only seen for ethnic roles. 
 Ohhhhh! 
 It's the LaBianca play! 
 Oh, this is so exciting! 
 Do you know your mother met Charles Manson on an airplane? 
 -No, I think. 
 It's a Charles Manson thing? 
 The LaBianca murders were a night of barbaric killings that he convinced his followers to do. 
 I think you should act like you know that, if you're going in. 
 -Bless her heart. 
 That woman was gutted. 
 [ Piano playing ] 
 Hey. 
 Thank you. 
 -Of course. 
 -Sorry. I can't drink out of bottles because I got braces. Hunh. 
 Turns out I'm a tongue thruster. 
 Okay, cool. 
 Your hair looks -- looks lovely, blonde. 
 Thank you. [chuckle] 
 Um, what was it that you wanted to talk about? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I don't know what I saw... in Montreal... but I know that I... need to bring it up. 
 Okay. 
 Do you know what I'm talking about? 
 Um, look, Chantal, I think I -- 
 I think I do. 
 This is all a big misunderstanding. 
 I... uh, really hope not. 
 [chuckle] 
 What? 
 Drew... when I was in Montreal, I, um... 
 I saw you. 
 [laughing] Okay. 
 Why is that funny? 
 [scoff] 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's not funny. 
 It's not funny. 
 Oh, wow. 
 It's, um... 
 It's very serious. 
 Okay, well, it's true. 
 [chuckling] 
 I like you so much, it's like, tragic. 
 Look, I'm just not in a place at all right now to be -- 
 No, you know what? 
 I actually don't even -- 
 I don't want you to say anything. 
 I just want you to know that I... think you're extraordinary. 
 You know, I want you to just... receive that. 
 Okay? [chuckle] 
 Okay. 
 I receive it. 
 Thank you. 
 I think you know Flicky and Nyanne, but this is Rayche, Lupile, Georgette, Nixine.

 It's so nice to meet you.

 -Hi, Selena. 
 -Selena found Wild. 
 Okay, this is amazing. 
 I'm truly so inspired right now, I just wanna, like, hole up in my apartment and, like, write the whole thing tonight.

 -You're so funny. 
 Please, though.

 -Okay. 
 -And, speaking of which, when can we see some pages? 
 We would really love to mock up a calendar.
