 ♪♪ So, April 
 [chuckles] um, I just wanted to start by saying that it seems like somewhere down the road, there's been some sort of misunderstanding. 
 Yeah. It appears to us that it is your opinion that we did something that we just didn't do. 
 -Yeah. 
 -Yeah. Yeah. 
 And after putting together the implications of your threats to Drew, April, do you think we killed someone? 
 -Because -- 
 -Yeah. 
 It's like, "What?!" 
 [ All chuckle ] 
 Wait. Are you guys saying you didn't kill a man in cold blood? 
 -No! No. 
 -[ Laughing ] 
 -Mm, no. 
 -Why would we? 
 -That's so weird. 
 -Oh, my God. You guys, I'm so sorry. 
 This makes me look so crazy. 
 You should've just called and told me that. 
 I wouldn't have had us all meet here so early in the day. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 This is so fun, April! 
 I'm so glad we got to catch up with you, but I think we're done, so maybe we should just leave, you guys. 
 -Yeah. Totally. Yeah. 
 -But it was so good to see you. 
 -It was great to see you. 
 -Enjoy your breakfast. 
 Or did you guys have to meet me here because you killed a man named Keith Powell? 
 Okay. So that's, I think, where the misunderstanding lies, -because -- 
 -No. It's not a misunderstanding when you overhear your neighbors screaming, "We killed a man, -and now he's dead!" 
 -Oh. Shh. 
 -"He's dead! He's dead!" 
 -Hey! Whoa! 
 -Hey! Shh! 
 -No, she's -- 
 Oh, my God! 
 That was my play. 
 -Yeah. 
 -April, I wrote a play, and we were doing a reading of it. 
 Did you like it, April? 
 I hope you -- 
 Shut up, Portia. 
 I know this wasn't a play. 
 -I'm not stupid. 
 -You know what, even if what you thought you heard was true, I mean, you don't even have any proof, so... it doesn't matter. Like, this is a waste of our time. 
 -and we should go. 
 -Right. 
 -Yeah. 
 -We're gonna bounce out of here, -and good luck with your -- 
 -Thank you. 
 A Talkgirl. 
 I had a Talkgirl. 
 [ Button clicks ] 
 Dory: Well, it's not like I meant to kill him! 
 Drew: 
 But you did! We all did! 
 Okay. 
 Now do I have your attention? 
 What do you want? 
 I don't know. 
 Money, tons of it. 
 How much? 
 I mean, I figure between the four of you, you could probably scrape together $60,000. 
 -What?! 
 -Absolutely not. 
 I know we look expensive, but that is way out of our range. 
 -Yeah. 
 -So, we get you the money, we give you the money, and you just give us the tape? 
 Yeah. But don't try anything. 
 I'll just call the police. 
 And how do we know that there aren't digital copies 
 -of that tape? 
 -What? 
 -Digital what? 
 -Like, is it backed up? 
 You mean, like, does it rewind? 
 'Cause, yeah, it rewinds. 
 It fast-forwards. 
 I can play it in slow motion. 
 No. April, are there copies? 
 Are there copies of the tape? 
 No. But I'm going to figure out how to do that. 
 Well, that's good. That's good. 
 Yeah. You should -- 
 Whoa! Hey! Hey! No! No! No! 
 [ All shouting indistinctly ] 
 Hey! Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! 
 You have 48 hours to get me my money! 
 Why are you doing this to us? 
 Because I don't like how you guys carry yourselves. 
 And I don't think you should kill people.

 Aphrodite: 
 When I met Fat Franky, I was little and stupid and living on the streets, like, worst, worst life, and then he came along, and he was rich with big shoulders, and so I thought, "Okay. Here's my chance." 
 But then I start to see, like, little signs that he's, like, doing bad things. 
 I saw some body parts here and there. 
 Anyway, I'm so certain that he killed this man that you're talking about. 
 He kill everyone. 
 I think he's still working at his bus company. 
 It's called, um, International Bus Exchange. 
 ♪♪ I'm sorry. 
 I just realized I went to high school with that guard, and I just got very distracted. 
 Could you repeat that? 
 When I met Fat Franky, I was little and stupid and living on the streets, like, the worst, worst life. 
 [ Train wheels clanking loudly ] 
 Drew: We're so screwed, okay? 
 There's no way we're going to get $60,000 in two days. 
 If we could get $60,000 in two days, I would get $60,000 every two days! 
 -Same! 
 -Yes. Of course. I don't know. 
 But I don't know. 
 Let's just think about it for a second. 
 Maybe she would be into some kind of, like, payment plan or something. 
 -It's so loud, I can't hear! 
 -We're just complaining 
 -about needing money, Porsh. 
 -That's the point, Portia! 
 -What about your mom? 
 -What? 
 Your mom! 
 I don't have a mom anymore, remember? 
 -I have banished her! 
 -Okay, Elliott. I'm sorry, but what about you? 
 Didn't your grandma just die? 
 No! She won't die! 
 We keep waiting for her to die, and she won't die! 
 Guys, like, I really can't hear! 
 It's really loud! 
 God damn it, Dory. Huh? 
 Why didn't you just take the reward money from Chantal's family when you had the chance? 
 -You know I couldn't! 
 -Well, I hate this! 
 I hate this, okay? I just -- 
 I'm halfway to thinking 
 -we should just kill April! 
 -Look, she's insane, all right? 
 So no one's gonna believe her if she doesn't have that evidence, so all we got to do is, we got to get that tape, -and then we'll be done with it. 
 -What do you want to do, Dory? 
 What, do you want to break into her apartment, and then some of us follow her around and make sure she doesn't come back? 
 -Yeah. 
 -Okay. 
 Okay. Should we do that? 
 I feel like that's what we should do. 
 Okay. Fine. 
 We'll see how it goes. 
 -We'll see. 
 -Okay. Okay. 
 Portia and I will do the easier thing. Yeah. 
 All right. Do we all feel good about that? 
 -Yeah! Yeah! 
 -All right. 
 -That's what we're going to do! 
 -I feel fine! 
 Guys, focus, okay?! 
 We need to figure out what we're going to do about April! 
 Oh, my God. You guys. 
 [ Kittens meowing ] 
 Aw. This one is obsessed with me. 
 Oh. Dory, will you take a pic? 
 I want to send it to Elijah. 
 I think we should all be concentrating on the door, okay? 
 I don't want to miss her. 
 We've been here forever, okay? 
 I can't keep pretending like I'm interested in buying the entire litter. 
 She normally leaves in the afternoon, so it should be any minute. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Still deciding? 
 Uh, yeah. It's just a lot of responsibility, so... 
 I know. 
 I wish we could split them up, but that would be inhumane. 
 -Uh-huh. 
 -But I like to think of it like six cats is six times the responsibility, but, oh, the chorus of purrs. 
 -Oh, I love that! 
 -That's so true, Kennifer, but I think my wife and I need to keep consulting. 
 -Thank you. 
 -Yeah. I think we're gonna need
