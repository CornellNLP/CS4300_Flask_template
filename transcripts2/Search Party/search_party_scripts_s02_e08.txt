 ♪♪ Dory, could you not scrub so hard? 
 You're gonna take the paint off the door. 
 Yeah, that's the point. 
 No. 
 The point is to take the blood paint off the door. 
 Not the door paint off the door. 
 We should have gotten some sandpaper. 
 Okay, look, I'll go to the store. 
 I'll go get some sandpaper. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Don't go. No. 
 You can't leave me here with "murderer" on our door. 
 Dory, I don't think anyone's gonna wander up here, see "urder" on the door and think, "I actually think these people killed someone." 
 -Whoa! Oh! 
 -Aah! 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I scared myself. 
 [ Laughing ] Yeah. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Um, can we help you with something? 
 Yes. I'm sorry. 
 I, um -- I'm looking for Dory Sief in apartment 4. 
 I think you might be her. 
 Yeah. 
 That -- That's me, yeah. 
 I'm Detective Joy Hartman. 
 I'm... 
 I'd love to ask you a couple questions, if that's okay. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Cool. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Don't... 
 Don't mind all this. 
 This is, um... 
 We have some new religious tenants, and they've been slapping rituals on all the doors, and... 
 We're not offended. 
 That's good of you. 
 ♪ Obedear, the sky is low ♪ 
 ♪ Watch fluent seamen rig their rudders ♪ Oh, wow. 
 What a lovely home you guys have. 
 -Oh, thanks. 
 -Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 -Yeah. 
 So, uh, yeah. 
 W-What is this concerning? 
 Um, I understand you were acquainted with a man named Keith Powell. 
 Yes, I was. 
 Yeah. 
 Um, Drew, do you wanna get us some tea? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 Oh, maybe something with not too much caffeine? 
 -I'll see if I have that. 
 -Thank you. 
 Here. Have a seat. 
 Thank you. 
 So, um, I'm not sure if you're aware, but Keith Powell passed away, and we have reason to suspect he may have been murdered. 
 I do know that, actually. 
 Um, well, something you should know is that, um, he and I had a -- a very brief, um, sexual relationship. 
 And it caused Drew and I to, um, break up. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Yeah. 
 But I appreciate you sharing it with me. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. Hey. 
 Sorry. I just, um... 
 Do you know how long this is gonna take? 
 Our friend is in a play this afternoon, and we really don't want to miss it. 
 Oh, fun! 
 What's the play? 
 Um, "LaBianca," it's called. 
 Like the murders. 
 We just really, um, would like to be on time. 
 Okay. Well, I'll, um -- 
 I'll make this quick. 
 [ Knocking ] 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I can come back later. 
 Oh, no. It's fine. 
 I'm on mute. 
 I just have to stay on the line and say 
 "Great job, everybody" every five minutes. 
 No. 
 I'll turn them down. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Um... 
 So, you know that the work that you do really means a lot to me. 
 And I would be very disappointed if I wasn't treated, um, seriously. 
 Lovely. 
 I think that's a fantastic sentiment, and I'll always remember it. 
 Well, I-I just want you to know that I-I'm very passionate and dedicated. 
 The same goes for me. 
 Mary, I'm -- I'm sorry. 
 I really am getting the feeling that you're not hearing me. 
 Well, it sounds to me that you're saying that you want me to communicate with you in a way that makes you feel respected. 
 Right? 
 Yes. 
 I think we're both on the same page. 
 Okay. Um, yeah. 
 That's -- That's it. 
 Th-- Thank you. 
 Glad you got what you needed to hear. 
 Great job, everybody. 
 Good stuff. 
 I love it when the clouds do that. 
 Sorry, sir? 
 Oh, no. 
 I'm just leaving a recovery center, re-entering the world, and noticing the clouds in an altogether new way, so... 
 Congratulations. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Can I ask what brought you there? 
 Uh, you can, yes. 
 When I first arrived, I believed I was traumatized by a recent tragedy. 
 But now I see I was withholding a much deeper and more fascinating truth from myself. 
 How long were you there for? 
 A little under two days. 
 Thanks for the water. 
 I don't have any water in my car. 
 And that's when I discovered, um, that he had been lying about working with Chantal's family, so I got weirded out, and I started to distance myself from him. 
 So then why did he purchase airline tickets for the both of you to go to Miami? 
 Well...he was obsessed with the beach. 
 And I think he thought that's, uh, where Chantal was and wanted us to go together. 
 But, you know, at that time, I had already, um, a-ascertained that Chantal was hiding away in a motel in New Hampshire. 
 How did you know from just the poem that she was in that particular motel? 
 Well, it was pretty suggestive. 
 Could you give me an example? 
 Um... 
 "Somewhere between Massachusetts and Maine. 
 Where the apple orchards turn into highways, from heaven looking down, the roads look just like two hands clasped." 
 So we just, uh, kind of messed around on Google Maps for -- for a couple afternoons and, uh... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ...we found her, which was nuts. 
 So, let me ask you. 
 Um, what are your thoughts on Chantal? 
 She's great. 
 She's a bit needy. 
 Right. 
 Well... this Julian Marcus person, he seems to think that she's a liar. 
 Do you think she would lie about her abuse? 
 [ Whistles ] 
 Oh, man. 
 As a man, I don't think I have the right to answer that question, so... 
 Right. 
 And -- And, personally, um, I always choose to believe the victim. 
 To the best of your knowledge, was Keith involved in anything shady? 
 Was there anything or anyone that stood out to you? 
 No. I mean, he would -- 
 He would reference, you know, lots of things, but nothing really, like, stuck out to me, you know. 
 I mean, he was a P.I., right? 
 So... 
 Right, but, um, when I spoke with his ex-wife, Deb, she said that you mentioned a man named Fat Franky. 
 And she said that you thought Fat Franky might be a danger to Keith. 
 Fat Franky? 
 Yeah. Yes. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 I-I did say that to her. 
 Um... 
 It was a name that came up more than once, so it made me think that, you know, maybe something was going on. 
 Or, you know, maybe it wasn't. 
 But I-I did. 
 I did say that to her, yes. 
 Okay. 
 Well, um, what did Keith say about Fat Franky? 
 You know, I do remember him on the phone once, and -- and he said something like, you know, "Fat Franky's, you know, the real danger." 
 You know -- something like that. 
 It was a small moment, but I did -- I did clock it. 
 Right. Right. 
 You know, uh, Fat Franky, it sounds like, uh -- sounds like a made-up name, doesn't it? 
 I mean, um, you'd think these, uh -- these mob guys, they'd be a little bit more creative. 
 ♪♪ 
 [ Laughs ] Yeah. 
 [ Laughs ] Yeah. 
 Okay. Here you go. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, are you sure this is caffeine-free? 
 I think this might be green tea. 
 I can -- I can feel my neck rattling against my skull. 
 Oh. 
 You know, it might be green tea. I'm sorry. 
 I'll, uh, keep it over here. 
 Let me know if you want it or anything. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry. That was stupid. 
 So, Dory... 
 Mm? 
 ...um, did Keith ever give you the key to his apartment? 
 No. 
 How about the log-in to his e-mail? 
 No. 
 He wasn't the kind of guy who would, you know, give out information like that... especially not to me. 
 So, um, I had a question for you, Drew. 
 Um, when did you first become aware of Keith Powell? 
 Uh...recently, for sure. 
 When exactly? 
 It must have probably been on the New Hampshire trip. 
 Probably when we found Chantal was when I became aware of him. Yeah. 
 Okay. So that would have been on the 26th. Right? 
 Uh, yeah. I suppose so. 
 I suppose so, probably. 
 So the same day he was murdered. 
 Oh, uh, it could have been later. 
 Yeah. 
 As Dory knows, I'm just not at all good at dates or names or faces or actors or, God, movies. 
 Just, oh, I can't tell if what's the movie is the title or the title is the movie, or do you name the movie or what is... 
 Movies these days, in general -- 
 I don't even know what those are. 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 Oh, man. 
 I'm just not good at stuff. 
 I'm not good at, uh. remembering. 
 Mm. 
 ♪♪ 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 Wow. 
 You look rested. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Thank you. 
 I feel phenomenal. 
 That's so great. 
 That's all we want to hear. 
 Oh. I really feel like I owe you guys an apology. 
 I want you to feel that you can trust me, of course. 
 Thank you. 
 I mean, I think what's important to us is that we were able to provide you with the help that you needed. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And, you know, this book is so real. 
 And we were thinking, "What if you were able to incorporate your breakdown, for lack of a better word, into the narrative?" Right? 
 I think that would be such a giving storyline. 
 You know, I learned a lot at Hallways. 
 And I really realized I just want to be honest. 
 And I want to be honest about this book. 
 -Yeah. 
 -So here's the truth. 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 I don't want to work. 
 I don't like working. 
 Working sucks. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Sorry. What? 
 Yeah, no. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 At first, I thought it was writer's block, but then, later, I realized it's actually just the discomfort of hard work. 
 Okay. Uh, yeah. 
 I mean, you know, who likes to work? 
 You know? 
 Not me. 
 You know, no one likes to, but we have to. 
 It's just kind of what you got to do in life, is work. 
 Mnh-mnh. Mm. No, not for me. 
 Not for me at all. 
 I mean, I have a lot of stuff I want to say in my lifetime. 
 But I've realized that I want to find the easiest way to say it. 
 Okay. Well, we'll find a ghostwriter. 
 I think that's what we'll do. 
 -That's easy. 
 -Yeah, we can do -- 
 Nia, you're not listening to me. 
 Working feels bad, and I don't ever want to work one more day in my entire life. 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 Oh, my God. 
 It feels so good to say that. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Did Keith ever mention Montreal to you? 
 No. 
 No, he never mentioned anything about Canada to me. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Uh, yeah. Excuse me. 
 I'll, um... 
 Yeah, I'll get the door. 
 It's probably just the super or somethin'. 
 Or it could be a package 
 'cause we get FedEx here, so... 
 -Drew, just get the door. 
 -Totally. 
 Yeah, I'll get the door. 
 I-I just want to say. 
 I'm not normally trying to guess who's at the door, so you don't have to write that down or anything. 
 Just get it, Drew. Yeah. 
 Get the door, yeah. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I'll get the door. 
 Oh, no. 
 Okay? You got to get out of here. We have company. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I just wanted to borrow a small cup of sugar. 
 A small cup of sugar? 
 No. 
 April, you cannot borrow a small cup of... 
 -Um, hi. 
 -Hi. 
 -Uh, I love your badge. 
 -Oh, thank you. 
 Are you a cop? 
 I'm a detective. 
 Oh. 
 Fun. April, maybe you could go now. 
 Oh, you guys got my flowers. 
 Oh. 
 Was there a special occasion? 
 Kind of. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Do you like them? 
 Yeah, we love them. 
 They're beautiful. 
 Oh, you guys should probably clean your door. 
 Oh. Also, could you guys keep it down when you fight? 
 I can hear literally everything. 
 Okay. 
 Well, nice meeting you. 
 You too. 
 I'm sure I'll see you around here. 
 Oh, okay. 
 -Bye, cop. 
 -Bye. 
 It's so nice that you know your neighbors. 
 Yeah. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 It was so nice meeting you. 
 You too. 
 Yeah. Get home safe or wherever you're headed. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! [ Sighs ] 
 April sent the flowers. 
 April knows that I killed somebody, and that cop's gonna catch us. 
 And who's Fat Franky?! 
 It's just some stupid name I made up to Keith's ex-wife! 
 Wait. What if that cop's downstairs right now, talking to April? 
 ♪♪ 
 [ Knocking rhythmically ] 
 Um, April? 
 Hi. 
 It's, uh, Drew and Dory. 
 From upstairs. 
 Hello? 
 April! 
 Open up the goddamn door! 
 You hear me?! 
 Open up the f*cking door! 
 Stop f*cking with us! 
 [ Laughs ] 
 What? 
 Sorry, I -- 
 I just forgot how crazy you can get sometimes. 
 These hipster kids did it! 
 They are full of sh1t, and they're hiding something. 
 I mean, there's, like, too many coincidences. 
 Oh, and you know what else I noticed? 
 That both of them are scared of me, and that means something. 
 I don't think I've been here since that one-woman show about Sylvia Plath. 
 Did you see it? 
 Sarah Jessica Parker has the dog. 
 -Do you know who Sylvia was? 
 -Aaron Eckhart -- 
 -Elliott. Elliott. 
 -Hi. 
 -Hey. 
 -So, it's April. 
 
 
 
 April's the one who sent the flowers, and she's the one who wrote on the wall. It's April. 
 I think she overheard us fighting in the apartment that night. 
 Okay. So, um, hi. 
 This is Portia's godfather, Bing, and his twink, Jason. 
 So maybe let's save it for another time. 
 Okay. Hi. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 And lovely to meet you, too. 
 Excuse us for a sec. 
 We need to tell Portia. 
 -Okay, well, she's backstage, obviously, and, no, we don't. 
 It can wait. Okay? 
 Remember what happens when we push our friends too far? 
 They have full mental breakdowns. 
 Well, it's time for me to adjust my catheter and get a vodka tonic. 
 Let's go, Jason. 
 -See you guys inside. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I really think we should go and see if April's hanging around. 
 No. Okay? We are gonna watch our best friend on the first day of previews for her play. 
 I can't sit through a play right now. 
 Dory! 
 Be a human being. 
 Um, I'm sorry. 
 Can someone help me replace the water cooler? 
 I'm missing half the bones in my left wrist. 
 -Yeah. I can help you. 
 -No, not you. 
 I'm sorry. I know that's rude, but not you. 
 Rene, I can help you, if you want. 
 Yeah. 
 I get it. It's hard. 
 Oh, you're the best. 
 You know what we should do? 
 We should find Tom. 
 Tom usually helps me with this.

 Frank Medici does business in Canada, where Keith was killed. 
 He helps ferry people across the border, whatever it is.
