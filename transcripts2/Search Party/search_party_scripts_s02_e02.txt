 It's just a text. It doesn't necessarily mean the worst. 
 His daughter sent him a text that said, "Are you with Dory?" 
 Okay? That is not a good sign. 
 Yeah. Well, maybe we'll just kill and bury her, too, huh? 
 Shouldn't be a problem for us. 
 I mean, Jesus, Dory, I thought you said you weren't even close with him. 
 I wasn't. 
 I didn't know that h-he told anyone about me! 
 Yeah, well, his daughter knows your name. 
 So that actually seems very close to me. 
 Maybe she means a different Dory. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Exactly how much does the daughter know about you? 
 There's no way for me to know. 
 I didn't know that she knew anything about me. 
 [ Voice breaking ] 
 It's so gross and sad. 
 She's still texting him like he's still alive. 
 Oh, god, should we just text back, "I'm dead?" 
 Dory, Dory, think, is there any reason to suspect that his family might know that Keith is in Montreal or that you're with him? 
 Okay. 
 There is literally no way for me to know what he told people about me. 
 None of this would be an issue if he was still alive. 
 -Goddamn it, Dory. 
 -Okay. Guys, guys, guys! 
 I don't know what you want me to say. All right? 
 I barely knew the guy. 
 I only knew him for 2 weeks. 
 [ Whispering ] 
 Okay. Everybody shut up! 
 Let's not freak out about this. 
 We have no idea what his daughter knows. 
 And there's a crack in this. 
 -Goddamn it. 
 -Guys, let's not freak out. 
 If only there was a way to make it seem like he was still alive. 
 Obviously, Portia. 
 Maybe we can make it seem like Keith never died here. 
 Okay? Maybe he was, like, on a vacation. 
 And we take all of his stuff. 
 And we put it on a train or something. 
 And we put it far away. 
 Do you know what I mean? 
 ♪♪ Yeah. 
 That's actually not the worst idea. 
 Yeah, Dory, because sometimes I have good ideas, too. 
 ♪ Obedear, the sky is low ♪ 
 ♪ Watch fluent seamen rig their rudders ♪ Jesus, Dory, stop touching everything. 
 The less fingerprints, the better. 
 Okay. Yeah, I -- I -- 
 I just want to make sure that there's no, like, PI photos of me or anything. 
 I don't want to leave a trace. 
 Did you guys have s*x in here? 
 No. 
 No, okay. Well, you don't have to lie to me, Dory. 
 Because I know you did. 
 Okay? 
 We didn't have s*x in here. 
 I know you did! 
 I can feel it. 
 I can feel it. 
 Okay, we only did it once! 
 God, Jesus, Dory, I don't want to hear that.

 [ Snoring ] 
 What the hell is this?! 
 Matthieu, I trusted you! 
 And this is how you repay me?! 
 No. No, no, it's not what it looks like. 
 Do I look stupid to you?! 
 You wake up in bed with another woman and expect me to believe that nothing happened?! 
 You're a pig, just like all men! 
 -What did we do? 
 -Nothing. 
 Okay? Nothing happened. 
 She snored the entire night. 
 I was pushing her off me. 
 And I -- I was begging her. 
 I was begging her to stop. 
 Okay? 
 My mother warned me about guys like you. 
 All you crave is s*x, s*x, s*x! 
 That's not true! 
 I'm a romantic. 
 Matthieu, get out! 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 This seems like a fine place, right? 
 I bet people leave cars here for days. Nobody cares. 
 Yeah. So when we go in there, I think you should be the one to buy the ticket. 
 All right? 
 In case they I.D. because you're a man. 
 You guys are so hard to find. 
 This car really blends in with the environment. 
 Okay. Can you just park the car? 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Trying to have a little fun. 
 Can I please have two tickets? 
 Do you think I should, uh, pick an aisle seat or a window seat? 
 Truly could not matter less. 
 Just get on the train, tuck his phone away in a seat pocket and get off the train. 
 It's very simple. 
 Hi, how are you? 
 -Good, sir. 
 -Good, that's nice. 
 Um, what is the furthest Canadian destination that your trains could take me to? 
 [ Train whistle blows ] 
 [ Bell ringing, train clacking ] 
 [ Brakes hissing ] 
 Okay. 
 So I'll be right back. 
 Young woman, you forgot your telephone. 
 Oh, um, no, I didn't. 
 Thank you, though. 
 Yes, you did. 
 It's right there. 
 I can see it. 
 No, look, I -- 
 I have my cell phone. 
 So I'm fine. 
 But thank you, though. 
 Then you have two telephones. 
 No, I don't. 
 You walked to that seat and stuck your telephone in it. 
 And then you walked away. And I watched you do every bit of it. 
 Oh, look. 
 Oh, my gosh, you're right. 
 Okay. Thank you.

 I would never consciously betray you like that. 
 It's fine, Chantal. 
 I'm really not upset. 
 I promise. 
 Okay. I need you to understand that I respect you so much as my friend and as, like, a kickass woman. 
 Hey, hi, hi, hi. 
 Hi. We got to go. 
 We got to go right now. 
 -Why? Where's Dory? 
 Uh, well, she's at the Drummondville station. 
 Why? 
 We'll tell you in the car, babe. 
 Just go clean up your little hideout and let's go. 
 Okay. But I was going to make eggs in a basket. 
 Chop, chop, Chantal, chop, chop! 
 -It'll be -- 
 -It's going to be so fun. 
 Yeah, it'll be fun. 
 It's a road trip. 
 -Okay! So good. 
 -Yeah. It'll be fun, Chantal. 
 -It'll be fun. 
 -Whoo! Whoo! 
 [ Laughs, pants ] 
 Is she okay? Where's Dory? 
 Everything's fine. Dory's just trapped on the train. 
 So we just need to make this look like we were never here and get out as soon as possible. 
 Okay. Okay.

 -I need a little air. 
 -Okay.

 You don't have to tell people the truth. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, i-if you're feeling anxious, you know, about what people will think about you or, you know, Agnus' Aunt Noni, you don't even have to tell people that we found you in her house. 
 Oh, my god, Chantal, I'd be feeling so anxious about that, too. 
 Yeah, I mean, that's true. 
 Yeah. So don't say that. 
 Just don't say that. 
 I mean, Chantal, we are here for you. 
 We will literally say whatever you want us to say. 
 Yes. 
 Okay? Right, guys? 
 100%, Chantal. 
 -Yes, yeah. 
 -Okay. 
 Um, I mean, this is kind of weird. 
 But I... 
 I wrote this poem a few years ago, um, that I really thought was going to do the rounds online. 
 But everyone just decided to hate it. 
 Um, about, this motel in New Hampshire. 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
 Okay, that's a start. 
 And my first plan when I ran away was to hide out in a hotel in New Hampshire kind of as like a screw you to everybody. You know? 
 Still kind of regret that I didn't do that. 
 -Yeah. 
 -Oh, well... well, what if -- if we love that poem? 
 And -- and somehow, in reading it, we were able to -- to figure out where you were? 
 And, you know, none of us ever even had to be in Montreal. 
 -Yeah. 
 -Yeah. I mean, does that make sense? 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, I mean. 
 Yeah, I guess I'd be into that. 
 Yeah? 
 I honestly love how this is all coming together. 
 ♪♪ 
 All right, guys. Passports. 
 And nobody has anything weird on them like Canadian cocaine, do they? 
 -Nope. 
 -No. 
 -We finished it. 
 -I, uh, I just want to remind everyone that my passport is fake in case that makes anybody uncomfortable. 
 What? Sorry, Chantal, you say you don't have your real passport with you? 
 -No, I left everything behind. 
 -Oh, my God. 
 Chantal, that's a federal felony. Do you know that? 
 Why didn't you say this earlier, Chantal? 
 I did! I just did! 
 So if you're not comfortable, you should get out. 
 We're not going to get out of the car because we're right in front of border patrol! 
 -Okay? 
 -We could literally all be detained, Chantal! 
 -Aah! 
 -"Margaret Wartime." 
 Your name is Margaret Wartime?! 
 I don't know. 
 It's from Chinatown. 
 -Wha-- 
 -Why did you pick Margaret Wartime? 
 It sounds like a fake name! 
 Should we turn around? 
 Should we just turn around? 
 No. No. 
 Guys, stop it. 
 You're really freaking me out. 
 Well, you should be freaking out, Chantal! 
 Okay. I can't even tell if this is a good passport. 
 Guys, none of us know Margaret Wartime. 
 She's a hitchhiker. 
 We picked her up on our way because we're nice. 
 And we let her have the front seat?!

 I got five in the car. 
 We're just coming from Montreal. 
 So we had a nice, quaint little weekend there. 
 It was really sweet. 
 Yeah, we, um, stayed at the Radisson downtown. 
 And they had a pool and everything, which we weren't even expecting.

 Yeah, of course. 
 You can -- you can stay with us today. 
 -Thanks, booboo. 
 -Yeah, Dory, I think you should find somewhere else to stay tonight. 
 Maybe I could just come by to get some stuff and clothes, like, for the night, though? 
 I don't know. I mean, you don't live there anymore. 
 So I don't think you can just invite yourself over. 
 Can we just talk about this later? 
 No, we can't. Because there's nothing more to talk about. 
 Hi, I thought I should tell you that Chantal is okay. 
 She's just in the shower. 
 Poor thing looks like she's been run over by a freight truck. 
 I want to apologize for my conduct at Chantal's vigil. 
 I should've listened to you, and I didn't. 
 It's -- it's really okay. 
 I mean, it all worked out, right? 
 I have issues with women exercising authority over me. 
 So I'm trying to work through that.

 Katherine, I'm so sorry that I ruined your bridal shower. 
 [ Voice breaking ] 
 Chantal, no way. 
 You'll never understand how hard it was for me to watch you plan your perfect wedding, all the while, concealing that my life w-was in danger. 
 What kind of danger? 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 I thought I was going to die every single day. 
 How, honey? 
 Goddamn it, Linda, let her talk. 
 I was seeing someone, um, that thrived on keeping me in a state of paranoia and f-fear. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Did he do that to you? 
 What? [ Sniffles ] 
 Oh! 
 [ Sobbing ] 
 Oh, my God, baby. 
 [ Sniffling ] 
 Yeah, we, um, actually we found her at a motel. 
 Yeah. We found her camping out in a motel in, um, in New Hampshire. 
 And we were very big fans of her poem, her fantastic poem. 
 Do you guys remember 
 "Dirty Old Motel"? 
 Yeah. I -- I think so. 
 Um, "Sitting on the floor of a dirty old motel, counting down the minutes till my compass works again, somewhere between Massachusetts and Maine, dirty old motel." 
 Oh. 
 [ Clapping softly ] 
 If we hadn't known, uh, Chantal to be the... the dreamer that she is, you know, the kind of artist who really escapes into her own art, uh, I don't think we ever would've figured it out. 
 Life imitating art, incredible. 
 When we started to worry that we'd never see our baby girl again, I put out a large reward. 
 And I think it's only right for me to offer it to you. 
 -No, we can't. 
 -That'd be great. 
 Um... 
 I-it's $250,000. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Yes, it is. [ Chuckles ] 
 Um, thank you so much. 
 Uh, it's such a kind offer. 
 It really is. 
 But, um... we can't accept it. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, Chantal just, you know, she means the world to us. 
 So we're just happy that we found our friend, you know? 
 All right. 
 In any case, please, let us find some way to thank you, dinner, something. 
 Oh, my God, that would be amazing. 
 I don't think there is any greater horror in life than when a parent and child are separated. 
 That is absolutely right. 
 Well said, Robert. 
 I would go so far as to say that, when a man and his future sister-in-law are separated, that perhaps that is the second greatest horror in life, of course, after two sisters are separated. 
 So parent and sister, and then sister's husband, I'd say that's the order. 
 Okay, Ted. 
 You know, it's kind of a shame that I never want to go back to Montreal, like, every again. 
 I thought it was really cute. 
 Yeah, I think I'll go back, like, in a few years, probably.
