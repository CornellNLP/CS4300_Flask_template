 Dory, she's dead. They found a blouse in the woods soaked in her own blood. 
 No, I know that. 
 But I saw her after the blouse was found. 
 So she's alive! 
 Dory, maybe it's possible you just saw someone that really, really looked like her. 
 Yeah, like the time I thought that roller coaster operator was Matt Damon. 
 I know how you feel, 'cause I felt so stupid. 
 That's not what this is, okay? 
 I know I saw her. 
 Now, you guys, you just have to believe me on this one. I'm telling you the truth. 
 Okay, but don't you think it's kind of crazy that the moment you become obsessed with this girl, you just magically run into her? 
 I'm not obsessed. And I'm not crazy. 
 I didn't say you were crazy, Dory. 
 Well, it was implied. 
 Okay, yeah, why don't we just use our inside voices, babe? 
 Dory, no one thinks you're crazy. 
 I think what El is just really trying to say is... you saw her. 
 Okay, sure, sounds good. 
 You know what? 
 I mean, you don't have to believe me. 
 Fine. I mean, the only people who have to believe me are the police. 
 Dory, I just said I believe you. 
 I know what I saw. 
 I know what I saw. And you guys weren't there, so... 
 You know, you're absolutely right. I was not there. 
 I haven't been to Flushing since that guy on Craigslist paid me to throw candy at him. 
 Mm. Flushing. 
 I thought that you said you were in Chinatown. 
 No, I said I was at a Chinese restaurant. 
 Yeah, Chinese restaurant, cool. 
 In Flushing. 
 In Flushing. 
 In Flushing. 
 Thank you. Thank you, Elliott. 
 Ooh, in Flushing. Well, good to see everybody. 
 Drew, where are you going? 
 Mm, where am I going, yeah. 
 Actually, I think I'm gonna go to Flushing. 
 Yeah, I hear Flushing's awesome this time of year, so I'll probably be there. 
 Can you just wait? 
 No. 
 See you guys. 
 Elliott, Julian lives in Flushing. 
 Oh, no. 
 Did they not pay? 
 Drew? 
 What, Dory? 
 What? [Scoffs] Are you... 
 What? 
 Are you mad at me or something? 
 I don't know. You know what? 
 I don't know about anything anymore. 
 Yesterday, you scream at me in the middle of the street when I'm just trying to be nice, and then you go hang out with your ex-boyfriend? 
 Okay, yes, I saw Julian. 
 Cool. 
 Okay, but don't make a thing out of this. Nothing happened. 
 You know I would never.. 
 Then why lie? 
 Why would you lie? 
 I didn't lie. 
 I just didn't say it. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, I really feel like you're just trying to find a reason to be mad at me. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Yeah. 
 Would you have ever yelled at Julian the way you yelled at me? 
 Oh. 
 I am sorry I yelled at you. 
 Cool. Well, it's not about the yelling. 
 Okay? 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Scoffs] 
 I got to go to work. 
 So I thought it would be, you know, pretty valuable information to let you know that she's still alive. 
 Mm-hmm. Okay. 
 And when was the last time you saw her before last night? 
 Six years, which I know sounds like a long time, but, you know, it doesn't feel that way with social media now. 
 Okay. Well, thanks for coming in. 
 Okay. I mean, is that it? What happens now? 
 Oh, we wait and hope for the best. 
 Wait and hope? 
 We'll do the best we can. 
 But she's an adult, and if what you say is true, I'm sure she's aware people are looking for her and she'll come home. 
 But she needs help. 
 And if she calls me, I'll be happy to help her. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I guess, uh... 
 I'll just let you get back to shooting black teens, 'cause that's obviously all you do. 
 Whoa! What the hell did you just say to me?! 
 I'm sorry. Sorry, I realize that that was a very big thing to say, and I-I didn't mean it. 
 You obviously just work behind a desk. 
 You know what? Get the... out of my office. 
 Okay, sorry. Sorry. 
 [Water runs] 
 [Sighs, clears throat] 
 [Toilet flushes] 
 Damn it. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Sniffles] 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Police are useless. 
 I feel like I spent the last hour talking to a wall. 
 [Water runs] 
 I mean, it's like, how many people come in here and tell you they actually saw their missing friend? 
 They didn't even care. 
 Wait. I'm sorry... Who's your missing friend? 
 Um, Chantal Witherbottom. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I saw her, too. 
 [Gasps] 
 She was gone. 
 I mean, I looked in every direction, and I yelled for her, and nothing. 
 So if you saw her at 10:30, that must have been, like, right after I saw her. 
 Yeah. 
 How do you, uh, know Chantal? 
 Oh, through family matters. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, she was always there for me. 
 God... 
 I'm so happy that I bumped into you. 
 And, you know, 'cause... 
 I... I was starting to doubt myself there. 
 Dory... it's called fate. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 The fire had blocked all the exits on our floor, and the snack room was engulfed in flames. 
 Now, I had two options... 
 Wet my shirt with my chai latte, which I was enjoying, and used it as a damp mask to breath through, or run to the elevators and wait for it to arrive. 
 Well, considering that I'm standing here before you today, which one do you think I chose? 
 [Laughter] 
 Intern, put the phone away. 
 Okay, let's talk fire extinguishers.

 The blood spatter is typical, Lieutenant. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 But... the interesting thing here is... well, come see for yourself. 
 I'm assuming that's not paint. 
 [Chuckles] No, ma'am. 
 That red there, that is blood. 
 They say a great artist is willing to die for her work. 
 The question is, is she willing to die for someone else's? 
 And cut. 
 [Bell rings] 
 That was so good. 
 You're so good. Look, I'm just... 
 Good job, everyone. 
 Let's just do one more from the top. 
 [British accent] Oh, bloody hell. 
 Do we have to? I think we've got it. 
 There was a boom shadow, so, yeah, we got to do another one. 
 [Scoffs] Can't we just fix it in post like we do with Elana's arm fat? 
 Sorry, so should I... 
 Um, I'm sorry... 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 You're such a good writer. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Was that sort of what you were looking for when you wrote it? 
 Yeah. You make my job easy. 
 Really? 
 Okay. Thank you. [Chuckles]

 [Pop music playing softly, bell rings] 
 Hi. Excuse me, do you have these in a sma... 
 Oh, my God. Mark, this is insane. 
 I had no idea you were working today. 
 Why wouldn't I be? 
 [Laughs] 
 You're hilarious. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Um, here, walk with me while I try these one. 
 How was your weekend, by the way? 
 Oh, so lovely. 
 Luke took me to the Cloisters because his aunt is the horticulturist there. 
 So she wanted to show us the corn poppies. 
 His family are such flower nerds. 
 It's kind of adorable. 
 Hand me those. Okay. 
 It's actually insane that you say that, because I had most incredible orgasm last night. 
 Do you remember those guys Lilo and Kotto? 
 They used to be in charge of those, like, Wednesday night things. 
 Do you remember that? 
 Mm. 
 Anyway, one thing led to another, and I ended up having a threesome with them at the Transportation Museum, essentially by accident. 
 What do you think of these? 
 I think you should go a size up. 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 I'm sort of deciding between three things. 
 Mm-mm. I heard about a party that I'm throwing. 
 Oh, really? What is it? 
 It's at Ramona's, just a few friends. 
 Nothing elaborate. 
 Well, then, I guess I am now deciding between four things. 
 [Chuckles] 
 There was no way in hell that I was gonna show up to work with my forehead stained with pink dye like a lunatic. 
 [Both laugh] 
 I mean, could you imagine me bossing people around like that? 
 No. 
 So where do you boss people around? 
 Oh. I'm a head Realtor at T.W. Brownway. 
 I don't know how acquainted you are with the, uh, company, but it's pretty high-end. 
 I really love my job, I do. 
 It's my calling. 
 Yeah? 
 What do you do? 
 Oh, I, uh... 
 I work as an assistant, um, to a lady who's married. 
 Oh. 
 It's pretty meaningless. 
 I'm just tired of things that don't matter. 
 Yes. 
 There is literally a person out there right now who is begging for help but is too scared to ask for it. 
 You're right. 
 Chantal is in danger. 
 What? 
 Yes. 
 And... 
 We can't talk about this here. 
 Let's go to my place. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 Hey, buddy. Um, they got my name wrong at the thing, so they gave me an extra milkshake. 
 Uh, I want to be clear, I didn't get this for you or anything, but if you want do want it, you can take... 
 No, no, no, no, it's good. It's... I'm good. 
 But, actually, can we walk in this direction? 
 I need to head uptown. 
 Aye, aye, captain. [Chuckles] 
 Great. 
 Yeah, so it's a pretty nice neighborhood, uh, overall, minus the construction. 
 It's kind of grotesque to cover up this beautiful architecture with scaffolding, you know? 
 I mean, scaffolding, although it isn't dangerous, is so ugly. 
 I mean, there's got to be... 
 Dude, I'm sorry, but can we actually start talking about Dory? 
 I mean, that is why you wanted to meet up. 
 I just find all this small-talk pretty unnecessary. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Awesome. 
 No, we can switch gears to that if that's what you want. 
 [Sighs] So? 
 Yeah, so, um... 
 All right. 
 I guess I just wanted to, um, say that... 
 I'm not very comfortable with Dory hanging out at your place like that. 
 Okay. 
 Is that it? 
 Are you sure that's all you wanted to ask me? 
 Yeah. 
 You don't want to ask me if I slept with Dory? 
 No, go ahead. Go ahead, ask me. 
 [Sighs] Did you? 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, is that a yes or a no, Julian? 
 Come on, dude, look at yourself. 
 You are standing in the middle of the street with two milkshakes talking to your girlfriend's ex-lover. 
 That seems pretty pathetic. 
 I don't think it's pathetic. I actually think it's mature. 
 And also I'm holding this 'cause it's a mistake! 
 I didn't get two milkshakes on purpose. 
 I didn't... Dory. 
 Cool. 
 Thanks for not ...my girlfriend. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what? Actually, I think I'm the one who's being the adult about this. 
 Whoa, whoa! 
 Really?! 
 Okay. Sorry about that. Oh. 
 I'm sorry I'm making you walk so far in those cute shoes. 
 Where did you get them? 
 I'm always on the lookout for the best things. 
 Uh, uh, I don't know. 
 You know, Dory, um... we actually passed my building about 10 blocks ago. 
 I'm probably being paranoid, but I'd rather be paranoid than stupid. 
 Paranoid about what? 
 Are... are we being followed? 
 Don't be so obvious, okay? 
 Is it him? 
 Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
 We don't want people to know that we're suspicious. 
 Who? I-Is it the same people who are after Chantal? 
 You know they broke into my building? 
 Replaced half of my electronics. 
 They didn't steal them, they replaced them as if I wouldn't freakin' notice. 
 What? Why? 
 You know, Dory, they own the most prestigious buildings in Midtown. 
 Who? Is it your real-estate company? 
 I don't know if you want to go down that road, Dory. 
 I mean, you already know too much. 
 Okay, that guy's still walking this way. 
 sh1t. 
 Quick! Let's go into that bodega for a second. 
 [Middle Eastern music plays] 
 Just buy a couple of waters or something. 
 You, out! 
 What? 
 You, out, out, out, out, out! 
 Excuse me. 
 Not you. You can never come in here. 
 How dare you talk to me this way! 
 Your friend is crazy. Get her out of here, please! 
 What? No, I am not, Dory. 
 I've never even met this man. 
 This is the first time I've even stepped foot in this bodega. 
 You know me. 
 She comes in here every week and make a huge mess and yell at everyone. 
 What did you just say about me, you freaking rat?! 
 Get out. I am calling the police. Get out! 
 Hey! I am a paying customer. 
 You cannot call the freakin' police on me, you... rat! 
 I'm a rat, you're a damn pig! You get out! - A pig? 
 What is your name?! 
 You don't need to know my name. 
 What is your name?! 
 You don't need to know my name. 
 Who is your manager?! 
 I am the manager! 
 I know my rights! 
 See, I'm right here. 
 You're not the manager! 
 I am... right here, right now. 
 You don't even know how to speak English! 
 Okay, so I finally get aboard the yacht when it hits me. 
 I'm like, "Okay, this weekend is gonna be literally just me and, like, three very famous pro wrestlers." 
 Of course, I've never heard any of their names. 
 [Both laugh] 
 'Cause I'm Jewish. 
 I'm so sorry, you guys. 
 Hang tight while I attend to sabotage.

 How was your day? 
 Um... weird. It was weird. 
 Hey, hey, hey! Hi. 
 Oh, hi! 
 [Smooching] 
 Hey! 
 Hi. Oh, hey, Drew. 
 Oh, my gosh, how was your day? 
 It was okay. Mine was so good. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 It was the first day of my new show. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I can't believe I was struggling with my inferiority complex all day because I was there, and I was like, "I'm good at this." 
 Right. 
 I know, I always... I always tell you that. 
 The flight attendant will not look up 'cause she's, like, obsessed with getting something out of her shoe. 
 And the only thing I could think to do... 
 Silence, silence! 
 Just one second. 
 I'm just gonna... 
 Shh! 
 Wrap that up. 
 I'll finish it. 
 Wrap that up. 
 I'll tell you later. 
 Okay. 
 We've gonna ordered... 
 We've ordered a few nibbles, um, maybe some olives, a cheese plate if you guys are excited about that. 
 Um, but right now, I want to take this moment to thank all of you and say that I love everyone that I invited here tonight. 
 Uh, some of you, I've know for years... 
 Whoo! 
 Some of you, I've never met at all. 
 No, we've met. 
 We haven't met. 
 Uh, so not to get too intimate, um... but when I was in high school, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 lymphoma. 
 And it was frightening, and it was disturbing, and it was beautiful. 
 And I learned to take friendship very seriously, okay, because the greatest lesson I learned in that entire time... is that you can't fight a war alone. 
 [Voice breaking] You need an army. 
 [Chuckles] So I celebrate life tonight. 
 Even if that means throwing a party for no reason at all. 
 I love you guys. You are my chosen family. 
 Okay? Especially you, Mark. 
 My boyfriend. 
 Come here. 
 Can we just talk for one second? 
 Look, about the Julian stuff, I just want to apologize. 
 You really don't have to, I promise. 
 I... I don't know why I didn't tell you. 
 I-I really should have. 
 Now, just hear me out, all right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm sorry, and I want to let you know I trust you so much. 
 And I'm not gonna freak out again or get jealous... 
 Dory! 
 Eight and a half, right? 
 W-What are you doing here? 
 We got to get these on and get out of here as soon as possible. 
 Who are all these people? 
 You didn't tell them anything, did you? 
 No. 
 Hi, I'm Drew. 
 I'm Dory's boyfriend. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Hi, Drew. Very nice to meet you. 
 Hi. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Are you guys going together? 
 Yeah, we date. 
 Yeah? Did you have s*x yet? 
 Yeah. 
 Dory, who is this? 
 Why is this man looking at my breasts? 
 I'm not looking at your breasts. 
 You were totally looking at my breasts. 
 I'm absolutely not looking at your breasts. 
 Dory, this man is sick. He's the Prince of Darkness. 
 You can tell by those black eyes. 
 My eyes are as blue as the sea, so... 
 Here's cheese, you guys.

 Let go of her! 
 Get away! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Let's go! No, no, no. No, no, I'm not with her. 
 They're after me! Sir! 
 No, they're after you, too! 
 Oh, my God! 
 [Sobbing] 
 My God, I'm still shaking. I'm fully shaking, look. 
 Just breathe through it, babe. Just breathe. 
 Hey, who was she talking about when she said they're after you? 
 Who knows? I mean, she's psychotic. 
 You know, she said she knew stuff about Chantal. 
 Obviously, she didn't. She just made it all up. 
 But, I, like, I wanted to believe it, 'cause I, like, wanted it to be real or something. 
 I should go to the hospital, right? 
 I could be hurt, and I probably don't know it. You know what I mean? 
 Could be really... hurt. 
 No, she's just... She's probably dead. 
 She's probably just dead. 
 You said you saw her. 
 If you said you saw her, she's alive. 
 No, I think I'm crazy and she's dead. 
 Dory, don't say that. You're not crazy. 
 I promise you're not crazy. I believe you. 
 You know, I think that if... If you think that you saw her, then I think you definitely saw her. 
 Thanks. 
 I think I just need to let it... let it all go. 
 I mean, all things considered, it does sound like you had a really cool day. 
 Hey, is your wrist okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. 
 [Sighs] You gonna be up a little longer? 
 Yeah, just a little bit. 
 Okay. 
 Till like 4:00 A.M., or what? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Oh. Brush your teeth.
