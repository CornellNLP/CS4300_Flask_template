 He was a man...

 I was sent to a conversion therapist to turn me straight when I was five. 
 His name was "Dr. Keith." 
 Oh, my God. But your parents were so liberal. 
 I know. 
 It's so messed up. 
 I hate them for it and I don't even know if I can forgive them.

 Who -- Who are you? 
 Just tell us where he is. 
 I haven't heard from him in over a week. 
 I mean, we broke up, so we haven't been in contact. 
 Why'd you break up? 
 I ended it because... 
 I just -- I got the feeling that he was getting involved in, like, you know, some weird sh1t. 
 What kind of weird sh1t? 
 Like, PI stuff. 
 What PI stuff? 
 Jesus! 
 I don't know, but there was definitely, like, some people he was afraid of. 
 Be specific! 
 Um, there was one guy... one name that he kept repeating. 
 Fat Franky. 
 Fat Franky? 
 Crystal. 
 Your dad know anybody who knows someone who goes by Fat Franky?

 Who's Ruby Plume? 
 Um, I haven't thought about her in such a long time. 
 She -- I was in this Web series she made like five -- four or five years ago. 
 -Okay. 
 -[Clears throat] 
 [Phone thudding] 
 Um, what do you think about her? 
 -Of Ruby? 
 -Yeah. 
 She's totally sweet. 
 She's sweet. Okay. 
 What do you really think about her? 
 Well, she's kind of a tragic figure. 
 How? 
 I'm always really nice to her, but there's, like, a unaddressed kind of weirdness between us, to be honest -- if I'm being honest. 
 -Weirdness? 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 -Why? 
 -You know, she asked me to be in her Web series and it was terrible and offensive to handicapped people. 
 And I had, like, three terrible monologues in it and she completely cut me out of the whole show. 
 And I know it was only because she didn't want anyone to outshine her in her own work, but... still. 
 Yeah. 
 That's not fair. 
 And she's a lot older than you think. 
 She looks good for her age, but there's photos of her partying with Beck from like 2002. 
 And my friend Richard hooked up with her, said she has huge areolas, so, like, I feel really bad for her. 
 -Okay. 
 -But, that being said, she has a great heart. 
 Okay. 
 Um, here you go. 
 This is, like, unique. 
 Thank you. 
 Um, why don't you call her and tell her that? 
 [ Laughs ] 
 No! 
 [chuckling] Why not? 
 That would be very cruel. 
 She, uh, cut you out of her show, right? 
 She begrudges your worth. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 I mean, you could just read, word for word, what you said. 
 I wrote it down. 
 Why would I do -- 
 I'm confused of why I would do that. 
 Are you afraid of the truth, Portia? 
 Great actors tell the truth.

 Okay... 
 You're really sweet, but also a tragic figure whose Web series was embarrassing, and offensive to handicapped people.

 And I know that your areolas are huge.

 Wow! Elliott!

 Uh, you should've called. 
 I'm, like, doing emails and stuff. Did Patty let you in or...? 
 Listen, I know you're busy, but I have huge news. 
 What? 
 Okay, two things. 
 One, I finished a draft of the book. 
 The entire book? 
 Oh, my God. Because, last time we spoke, you, like, didn't even have a page. 
 I know. I can hardly believe it myself. 
 I mean, it just flows out of me. It's remarkable. 
 It's insane. 
 -Wow! God. Congratulations. 
 [laughing] Thank you. 
 Well, I don't wanna celebrate quite yet. 
 I mean, I know it's just one draft and, you know, I know there are tons of revisions ahead of me 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 -and I also was mugged. 
 Wait. Oh, my God. 
 You were mugged? 
 I'm 99% sure it was a hate crime. 
 Oh, my -- I -- Ohh. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It was awful. 
 They took everything. 
 I had to cancel my cards and they took the laptop.

 Hey, Max. 
 Hey. You ever seen one of these before? 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 Uh, I just wanna talk to you real quick. 
 I, um, I want to let you know that I'm also applying for the Shanghai position and I was hoping that you would be willing to write me a recommendation, you know, as my, um, supervisor. 
 Yeah. You're not gonna get that. 
 Okay, why not? 
 Because Alan Yang's gonna get it. 
 He's a shoo-in. 
 He speaks Chinese. 
 Okay, [sigh] I'm fully aware that Alan speaks Chinese, but I would really appreciate if I was in the mix for this. 
 I can't express to you how much I would love to go to Shanghai. 
 Then maybe you should play the lottery 'cause you've got a better chance of winning that than you do of getting the Shanghai position. 
 I'm just being honest with you. 
 Okay, Max, I -- 
 I really insist that I should be considered on this. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, you insist? 
 I respectfully demand that you 
 -Oh. please write me a letter of recommendation. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Well, um, how's this, then? 
 Um -- 
 "It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend Drew Gardener for the Shanghai position that he will never get as long as Alan Yang is alive and well 
 'cause Alan Yang speaks Chinese fluently, Drew. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So, you're hiding out in a motel room in New Hampshire? 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 And your abuser would come up with creative ways to hurt you every day. 
 Can you give me an example of what that means? 
 Okay, so, this one time, we were supposed to meet up. 
 We had plans to take me shopping. 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 -And he was four hours late because his kid, like, broke his leg or something. 
 And so I was waiting in the pouring, freezing rain for four hours.
