 Hey. 
 Um, I got to tell you something before we head off. 
 I f*cked up. 
 Guatemala. 
 The money, like, fees and... 
 We're short. 
 How much? 
 How much are we missing? 
 40,000. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ, Cobi. 
 And you didn't know about the 40,000 f*cking dollars in fees? 
 Yes, I knew about that, but I didn't know about this. 
 Lex : Hey, Gus. 
 End of the road. 
 I didn't... I didn't tell the guys. 
 Well, we can't tell them now. 
 Look, we can't go. 
 We have to. All right? We don't have a choice. 
 We can get back in the car and we can just go back. 
 To where? 
 That is the only way out. 
 You okay? 
 I just want to get this sh1t over with.

 Joel : We're already fall guys. 
 Gus : You think Aaron gives a sh1t about us? 
 Who better to blame than four dudes already accused of murdering a cop? 
 Lex : Blame us for what? 
 Gus : Anything. 
 Oh, look, wrapping's coming off. 
 Lex : Yeah, well, don't mess with it. 
 You're gonna make it worse. 
 Just peel it back a little bit, we could take a look what's inside. 
 What, are you crazy? 
 I'm not... I'm not gonna open it. 
 I'm just gonna go... look, it's already this far. 
 Okay, let's vote. 
 Who thinks we should look inside? 
 This is a really bad idea. 
 Wait. 
 What if... what if it's, like, a bio-hazard thing, like, a chemical weapon? 
 Jesus opens it up and... [hisses] he's dead, and we're dead with him. 
 My finger's already in it. 
 Well, you're dead. 
 Wait, wait. 
 It's wrapped in some kind of textile. 
 Textile? Who says textile? 
 What, are you John f*cking Adams? 
 You know what I mean.

 Man : Good afternoon, everyone. 
 This is a product that is intended to change and improve both your health and your looks, too. 
 It's called the Blender Source. 
 15 miles in under 30 minutes. 
 Heart rate never got above... go ahead and guess. 
 110 BPMs. 
 Sample? 
 Thank you, sir. 
 That's Kale... and tomato. 
 You should have some of this. 
 Tremendous confection for the prostate. 
 Worry about your own prostate. 
 No, my prostate's golden. 
 Your bosses won't be pleased when they hear that I've been treated disrespectfully. 
 I came up with many of them. 
 I'm even responsible for some of them being where they are. 
 Where they are? 
 What do you mean, like retirement homes? 
 Mm-hmm. What is that? 
 It's, like, dragon fruit and something. 
 This is a small country. 
 You wouldn't want us not to be friends. 
 Duly noted. 
 Are you gonna buy a blender or are we done here? 
 Instead of being the all-day smart-ass, why don't you listen to someone who actually knows what he's talking about? 
 'Cause you can have all the Internet skills and diplomas and triathlon f*cking medals you want, but at the end of the day, the only thing that actually matters in this business is contacts. 
 That means talking to people, getting to know them, gaining their trust. 
 It's pomegranate. 
 Dragon fruit and pomegranate. I should've... 
 I should've nailed that one. 
 I'm a who's who of Belize. 
 I'm a human f*cking phone book. 
 Now, see, that is exactly my point. 
 Nobody uses the phone book anymore. 
 I've been here for 20 years, you f*cking prick. 
 And nobody has a clue who I am. 
 You're already known locally as the w*nk*r on the bike who smells of fish. 
 Hardly f*cking covert. 
 How about you just... just worry about yourself? 
 I am, because you're drawing attention to me. 
 You listen to me, you ancient f*ck! 
 Nobody is paying attention to you.

 Hey, um, on my way up here, I saw a woman walking through the jungle with a long white dress, long hair. 
 You saw Xtabai. 
 See what? 
 Xtabai. 
 Sometimes you can find shrines to her in the woods. 
 She like a spirit. Men look for her. 
 They do? 
 Sure. She can be dangerous. 
 She beautiful, but, uh, if you can't please her, you die. 
 What do you mean? Like, s*x? 
 Why do you die? 
 Because she's Xtabai.

 Um... 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Do you have a security pass to be in here? 
 Um... 
 Oh. 
 I am trying to find your friend. 
 Rochelle? 
 She's really more of colleague than a friend. 
 Well, that's helpful. 
 I've already been to every hospital, morgue, hostel, hotel within a ten-mile radius. 
 You didn't find her? 
 I want you to make a list of the same places within a 20-mile radius and keep making that list until you reach the border.

 Can you do that for me, sweetie? 
 Sweetie? It's 2016.

 Okay?

 I will buy you a drink. My treat. 
 Thank you, but no thanks. 
 We're waiting for someone.

 We all have to drink, you know, a welcome to the town. 
 Uh, you will like. It's very good stuff. 
 All right. Cheers.

 Oh, no, he's not gonna have a drink. 
 It's not good for him, so... 
 Oh, it's not good for me; I still drink.

 He's all right. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 This is a nice town with nice people. 
 It's okay to drink with nice people, right? 
 Lovely people and no offense. 
 I just... I never drink alcohol. 
 You know, look, I'm gonna have his drink for him. 
 No, you already have your drink. 
 Now it's time to take his drink. 
 He doesn't need a drink. 
 No, it's not okay.

 Big deal, all right? What? 
 No, I... Oh! 
 I'm really sorry. 
 Sorry about that. 
 That was just a total accident. 
 What is this? 
 That belongs to Jesus.

 It's... it's not ours to open. 
 Is... is he here? 
 It's really meant for him. 
 Yeah, we-we were told to give it directly to Jesus. 
 Right, we-we delivered the package and-and the money, so I think we should probably go. 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 Open it. 
 Pablo. [Speaking Spanish] 
 f*ck me! Who wrapped this? 
 There's a lot of money in the bag. 
 Yeah, w-we came to return it, along with that. 
 How they get you to come here? 
 They take your wives? 
 Your kids? 
 Aaron. 
 Aaron sent us.

 Big conehead m*therf*cker with the f*cking biker tights.

 I know Aaron. 
 You know that fucker took a boat, Jesus's boat, in the middle of a f*cking drop, man, in the middle of the day. 
 That took some serious balls, man. 
 That's a giant motherfucking move! 
 Except it wasn't, 'cause you bozos stole the damn boat. 
 [speaking Spanish] 
 Yeah, but we did return the package and-and... and the money, right? 
 Yeah. 
 If-if this is about the boat, we can show you where it is. 
 And-and... it's not damaged or anything. 
 It's just... just muddy. 
 Jesus will probably want to kill you. 
 All I can say is that we are... very, very sorry. 
 You're Catholic. 
 Are you Catholic? Católico. 
 I... I was raised Catholic, yeah. 
 So what are you now? 
 I don't know. 
 Were you confirmed? 
 Yes. 
 Then you're Catholic! 
 What name did you take? 
 Your confirmation name. 
 Luke. 
 Because of Luke the Skywalker? 
 Yes.

 Guess... where you are. 
 I-I'm sorry. I don't know. 
 Guess. 
 Uh, I guess maybe some... there. 
 Touch. Touch where. 
 Ah. 
 [imitates buzzer, laughs] 
 We are where Mexico, Guatemala and Belize intersect. 
 We are nowhere. 
 [laughs] 
 There's a saying up here. 
 Keep your mother in Guatemala, your wife in Belize and your girlfriend in Mexico. 
 Isn't that right, Pablo? 
 ¿Que? 
 ¿Que? 
 They both know about the Mexican girl, Pablo. 
 [laughs] 
 Guatemalans will f*ck anything. 
 You know who else will f*ck anything? Bam! 
 [laughs] 
 We shouldn't have come. 
 sh1t, sh1t. 
 sh1t. 
 They're gonna kill Joel. 
 They're gonna kill us. 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, we-we brought back the money. 
 That was the deal. 
 We brought back the f*cking money. 
 The money, it's short. 
 We're 40 grand short. 
 I f*cked up in Guatemala. 
 You didn't tell us. 
 I told Joel. 
 I told him. He knows. 
 I said we shouldn't come here, and he said we don't have a choice. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I never liked Captain Moreno. 
 Jesus adored her. 
 I don't know why. 
 [speaks Spanish] 
 Sit. 
 [counting machine beeps, rattles] 
 You have a nice smile. 
 Do people tell you that? 
 Uh, no, no. 
 Women think it, though. 
 And you know they do, so you use it on them. 
 I can tell because you give it a little extra. 
 [laughs]: Hi. 
 You're aware of it. 
 If a person were perceptive, they'd be aware that you are aware of it. 
 Maybe that's all part of it. 
 A whole other conversation happening with your smile. 
 Do you want to f*ck? 
 I used to not say what I think. 
 Now I do. 
 Try it. 
 Say what you think. 
 I'm getting bored, Joel. 
 Say what you think. 
 Say. Say. 
 I think the "J" on the jacket isn't for Jesus. 
 I think it's for Jazmin. 
 I think you're Jesus. 
 Ooh. 
 [laughs] 
 Jesus is my father. 
 He's on vacation. 
 What? 
 Say. 
 I think... 
 I think he's probably not on vacation. 
 I think maybe he's... maybe something happened to him. 
 Correct. 
 He was strangled with a barbed wire. 
 Say what you think. 
 Now I think maybe you strangled your father with barbed wire. 
 My muscles make you not want to f*ck? 
 For some, they are kind of horny. 
 There's something you should know. 
 Want a bump? 
 Not right now. 
 Me neither. 
 [snorts] 
 Ah, I just do a little. 
 The money's short. 
 It's 40,000 or so short.

 Some girls, they... they can handle it. 
 Look at me. 
 I turned out okay. 
 So where is Mr. Big Bro, Big Guy? 
 He's inside. 
 With Jesus. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 Lex : But, listen, I want to apologize for spilling the drink; That was an accident. 
 No hard feelings, okay? 
 No hard feelings. Don't worry. 
 What... what if... what if I can help you? 
 Maybe, say, do things for you? 
 I'm a f*cking drug dealer, man. 
 What if I could? 
 Give Big Bro this from me, okay? 
 Yeah.

 Okay? No hard feelings. 
 Cool, man. 
 No hard feelings, all right?

 I located my dad. 
 How? 
 I got sentimental and found him online. 
 Linkedin. 
 He's been stocking groceries for the last ten years in the same place. 
 Why does he need a Linkedin account? 
 I don't know. 
 Why would anybody need a Linkedin account? 
 That's funny. 
 You keep cracking jokes, Lex. 
 Mm.

 Excuse me! We need help. 
 Our friend... our friend was stabbed. 
 Calm down, calm down. 
 Okay. 
 How long ago did this happen? 
 Um, I don't know, like, an hour. 
 Here, turn him around. Here, hey. 
 Don't rush him, don't rush him! 
 All right. Got him? 
 Yeah. 
 Easy, easy. 
 Okay. 
 Here, come on, let's go. 
 E.R. Hurry. 
 Pressure on it. 
 No, you guys, wait here, wait here. 
 We'll take care of your friend. 
 Okay. 
 Jesus... you get to meet him? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, what'd he say? 
 They know we were short? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Wait. Why... why did he let us just walk away? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe Jesus forgave us. 
 Where are you going? 
 Call Aaron.
