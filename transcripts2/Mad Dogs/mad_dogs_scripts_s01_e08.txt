 Good f*cking riddance. 
 What did I say? 
 I said if we come back here, they're gonna kill us. 
 We're alive for a reason. 
 Lawrence owned the villa. 
 Milo scammed him out of it and put it in our names. 
 What does that mean for us? 
 My guess is we'll be getting a visit from his estate lawyer in the morning. 
 Till then, we may as well just get some sleep. 
 [coughs] 
 Thanks. Thank you. 
 Thanks for coming back to get me. 
 I'm really sorry about this. I... 
 I don't know what else to say. 
 sh1t. Hold that. 
 That's a really nice watch. 
 Anniversary present. 
 Got one for Ava, got one for me. 
 Nice. 
 But like every other nice gesture I've tried, that one blew up in my face, too. 
 How come? 
 Ava's niece babysitting. 
 Lifted the damn thing. 
 Well, that's too bad. 
 Ever get it back? 
 [scoffs] Hell no. 
 Ava just accused me of pawning it and blaming it on her niece. 
 sh1t just kind of went downhill from there. 
 Really hasn't stopped since. 
 You're good. 
 Thank you, man. 
 Yeah. 
 You got it. 
 f*ck. 
 Aw, man. 
 How the hell is he doing that? 
 [door opens] 
 Early risers. My kind of guys. 
 Let's get you out of Belize, huh? 
 You're American. 
 Let me make sure I got this right. 
 You must be Gus. 
 Alexander... That's you? 
 No. 
 I go by Lex. 
 Okay. What happened? What happened there? 
 Oh, the guy, you know, the cat, the one that... 
 "The cat" he calls the guy. 
 Little b*st*rd ran out of lives, didn't he? 
 Anyway, that means you're Joel. 
 Can you get us home? 
 Yes, I can. 
 And Cobi? 
 Oh, no. I can't pound you. 
 You're lousy with berry bugs. 
 What? What is it? 
 Berry bugs. Harvest mites. Nasty little guys. 
 They cling to tight places, moist, sweaty places. 
 They're not... They're bad news. 
 Gus, Cobi, Lex, Joel. Got it. Perfect. 
 You guys are all from Illinois. I grew up just north of there. 
 Like Milwaukee? 
 This is exciting. 
 You guys, you're gonna ace this thing. 
 What thing? 
 Lawrence will drive you. 
 I'm Aaron, by the way. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 What thing? 
 Oh, it's a wire. 
 It's always a wire. 
 What'd you do? 
 How'd you beat me? Barrel Boom? 
 Lawrence : Honey Camp. 
 Aaron : I took Manatee Mountain. Goddamn it. 
 Well... [chuckles] 
 Welcome to Camp Chiquibil. 
 You guys are all perfectly safe here. 
 You're also free to leave whenever you please. 
 Well, thank you. 
 You should know, Gus, that there's very little chance of you ever returning to Chicago without my help. 
 Yeah? Why's that? 
 Well, one, there's DNA evidence tying one of you to your friend Milo's death. 
 Two, you guys are all wanted in connection to the death of a local convenience store owner named Algrove, who was found face first in the same swimming pool as, three, the murdered police captain. 
 And that one, I'm pretty sure you guys actually did. 
 Oh, and let us not forget our missing chargé d'affaires. 
 Just for the record, that one was a total accident. 
 Well, even if you did manage to escape, make it to the American border, you'd just be detained at Immigration. 
 What is that? 
 What charge would Homeland Security hold us on? 
 Yeah, w-we're Americans. 
 Aaron : Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 We drone-kill Americans in foreign lands. 
 Why don't you give them the good news? 
 The good news is I'm in a position to make all this go away. 
 Aaron has connections. 
 Aaron : Not to mention your passports. 
 Yeah? What do you want from us? 
 To deliver a package. 
 In exchange, I'll make all your problems disappear. 
 What package? 
 To who? 
 Those are great questions. I'll answer them as soon as I know you're on board. 
 Guys, guys? This is bullshit. 
 It's bullshit! Let's go! 
 Too good to be true, huh? 
 You know what? Maybe it is. Maybe it is. 
 You guys discuss it internally. 
 I'll give you a moment to huddle up. 
 All right? Go ahead. 
 Why are we still standing here? 
 He said we're free to go. 
 You believe that? 
 Welcome to Camp Mind f*ck. 
 Should we even be talking about this with her? 
 Coggah Rum? She's deaf as an adder. 
 All Aaron's workers are deaf. 
 But can I give you a steer? If there's any way you can get the rest of that money back, then do it now. 
 Because if he finds out it's short, things could very quickly take a turn for the worse. 
 And you care because...? 
 I think we've seen enough killing for one week. 
 If you tell me where it is, I'll fetch it. 
 And I'll also bring some paperwork. 
 You can sign the villa back over to me. 
 Put a line under the whole sorry business. 
 Th... 
 This woman has it... Erica... 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 She works at the pharmacy at the counter. 
 Faber's. 
 We went to her house. 
 She skipped town. It's too late. 
 What car she drive? 
 A sh1t blue Corolla, but with a busted rear bumper. 
 That's all I need. I'll be in touch. 
 You happy? 
 I got my ass kicked defending those people. 
 You just killed a f*cking family. 
 They had the money! 
 You just killed a family. 
 They stole it twice! 
 I want to go home. I don't want to die. 
 So I don't want to go home? That's what you're saying? 
 I don't want to go home? 
 Aaron : All right, good stuff. 
 Looks like we're all still here. 
 Are we all still here? 
 Great. 
 Let's take the tour. 
 Of the 103 small businesses that my parent company founded, only two of them have turned a profit. 
 This is one of them. 
 God, this thing stinks. 
 Are those women whacking off the fish? 
 Aaron : Yeah. 
 Now, this is the secret weapon. 
 This is the broodstock. 
 Breeders... Healthy, lipid-rich mothers. 
 They help us to attain the highest hatch rates and yields per acre of any hatchery in the region. 
 So it's something we're, uh... really proud of. 
 You guys can follow me this way. 
 This is really cool. 
 All right. Lex, Gus and Joel, I'm gonna have you guys sit tight. 
 Cobi, you're gonna come with me. 
 We're going to take care of that berry bug problem. 
 Oh, great. 
 What kind of sign language is that? 
 One of our own devising. 
 All my employees speak it. 
 Cobi : So, uh, that private... private sign language thing, it's, like... it's, like, for secrecy, right? 
 You ran your own business, correct? 
 Yeah. 
 You know, I'm sensing that you and I are on a similar wavelength, but from your friends I'm sensing dissonance. 
 Well, I know. You'd probably be the same if you had the vacation we just had. 
 I am not f*cking around right now. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I know you went to Guatemala. 
 I know you crossed the border last night. 
 How... how'd you know that? 
 I'm the guy that makes things work around here. 
 I'm the guy that decides who comes and who goes and who lives and who doesn't f*cking exist anymore. 
 Okay. Sure. 
 But, hey, you made it out. 
 That's saying something, right? I mean... 
 And when your friend needed you, what'd you do? 
 You came back. 
 That's the stuff that leaders are made of. 
 So, listen, I'm gonna need you to be like a... 
 I don't know, like a project manager. 
 Keep your friends focused. Keep 'em positive. 
 It will literally be the difference between life and death. 
 When we pull this off, I'll make it worth your while. 
 Really? 
 Like how? 
 Let's just say you won't be working in some office in a shitty strip mall, wearing department store suits anymore. 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah. I don't... 
 I don't work in a... like, a strip mall. 
 And if I were you, I wouldn't mention Guatemala to your friends. 
 But I came back, and you just said that that showed, like... 
 Right. What we're looking for is, like, an all-for-one, one-for-all kind of vibe, and I wouldn't want them jumping to the wrong conclusions. 
 Right. 
 You understand? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right. This is gonna sting. 
 What's gonna sting? 
 Ow! f*ck! Ow! 
 Why is she wearing that mask? 
 f*ck! Ow! Ow! 
 [yelling] 
 [birds squawking] 
 Cobi : Okay, guys. 
 This is the, uh... package that we need to deliver to Jesús... 
 Along with his money that you owe him. 
 That we owe him. 
 What's in it? 
 I don't know. 
 Then why are we delivering it? 
 Plausible deniability. 
 They already tried to get Milo to do it. 
 Aaron : Close. I outsourced to Lawrence. 
 I asked him to deliver a package to a boat, bring the boat to a certain set of coordinates, and then leave the boat there. 
 He handed the job off to Milo, and then it was, you know... 
 It was a miscommunication. 
 Miscommunication? A guy in a cat mask blew his f*cking head off. 
 Yeah, and this guy right here? 
 He's the one who finally took care of him. 
 So maybe we should hear him out. 
 Okay. Well, why don't you put an end to all of our problems and just FedEx the f*cking thing? 
 Jesús knows that you were on the boat. 
 He knows you collected the money. 
 Therefore, you have to be the ones to deliver the package to him. 
 He's kind of expecting you. 
 Hey, I didn't force you guys on that boat. 
 Whoa, Gus! What are you...?! 
 Hey, what are you doing?! 
 Peanuts! What is he, a f*cking elephant? 
 How do you know there wasn't anthrax in there? 
 Shut up! 
 Right? 
 You guys are missing the point. This is good. 
 It's good to know the weaknesses of your team up front. 
 That's why I conducted this test with a dummy package. 
 Now, Gus, you clearly have some trust issues. 
 Problems with authority, huh? 
 Cobi, you need to be way more assertive, my man. 
 Okay. 
 And, Lex, if I might, just a bit too trusting. 
 And, Joel... [sighs] 
 You got some anger in there. 
 Am I right? 
 All right, follow me. 
 You guys are gonna have to hike 15 miles across a rainforest. 
 No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. 
 Are there roads? Can we drive? 
 There is one road, but it's crawling with bandits. 
 Follow me, please, gentlemen. 
 This is my sundries closet. 
 You'll find all the knowledge and supplies that you'll need for your journey. 
 Pull this off and you're homeward bound. 
 Look, you said it was a day's hike. 
 Why would we need all this sh1t? 
 Maybe you won't. Your call. 
 Hey. Knowledge is power. 
 There are things out there. 
 Insects that can paralyze, deadly terrain, unexploded ordnance fields. 
 But I guess you guys got it all figured out, huh? 
 I'll leave you to it. 
 We need to be on the road by nightfall so you can be in position by dawn. 
 You know, I may be going out on a limb here, but given the alternatives, I just got to say, I'm impressed with this guy and his company. 
 This isn't his company. This is the company. 
 This is a CIA front. 
 You think he's CIA? 
 That's good, right? 
 [scoffs] 
 Lawrence has been CIA-sanctioned drug trafficking for decades. 
 He told you that? 
 He works with Aaron, right, wh-who's paranoid enough to hire only deaf workers, who creates his own f*cking sign language, right? 
 Who kills little people with f*cking crossbows and gets off on it. 
 Holy sh1t! 
 There's f*cking rockets in there! 
 Well, he's the only person that actually tried to help us since we got here. 
 Yeah. Guess Rochelle didn't count. 
 Okay, second person. 
 Look how we f*cked that up. 
 Okay, well, we'll try not to f*ck it up. 
 Okay, should we mention the missing money? 
 I mean... 
 No! 
 Jesus Christ, no. 
 [whispers]: This place might... might be bugged. 
 What? 
 [whispers]: Place might be bugged.

 I suppose he must also forgive 4G LTE as well. 
 There's a car left Belize City not so long ago. 
 It's traveling on one of the three highways. 
 Your people have farms along all of the highways, and each of the farmers has a wife with a phone stashed away. 
 We agreed to transport your parcels, nothing more. 
 We are not a mafia, and we do not want any part in violent and treacherous deeds. 
 I think you've just given me the title of my memoir. 
 [chuckles] 
 No, thanks. I carry my own. 
 The terms of our deal were clear. 
 I helped you protect your land against government acquisition in return for small favors. This is such a favor. 
 Gerda : If I bend any further, I won't bend back. 
 I have strayed too far from righteousness. 
 That must feel really good. 
 Question. 
 Should I shoot Mommy... or should I shoot boy-o? 
 Get out! 
 Much depends on me finding this car. 
 So what can you do for me? 
 
 
 
 [birds chirping] 
 Enough of this bullshit. 
 I'm out. I'm out. 
 Where are you going? 
 Belize City, because a certain family might be better off if I got to them before Lawrence did. 
 Should we go after him or should we stay here? 
 No, just let him go. He'll come back. 
 He just needs to blow off some steam. 
 He's not coming back.

 Um, there's been a... a slight hiccup. 
 One of the team left, took off. 
 It was Joel, right? 
 Gus. Why did you think it was Joel? 
 Cobi, I asked you to manage your team. 
 Yeah. Um, I know. 
 Well, you know, I didn't think he was gonna do it. 
 But then I was pretty sure that, you know, he was gonna come back. 
 So I'm-I'm not exactly sure if this, like, affects things m-moving forward. 
 Yes. Yes, it does. 
 There's an expectation that the four of you will arrive together. 
 Ooh.

 Excuse me. 
 I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir. 
 Sir, excuse me. 
 Excuse me. 
 Sir, excuse me. [Gasps] 
 Oh! 
 ¡Corre! ¡Corre! ¡Corre! 
 What was that? 
 That would be the ordnance field. 
 There's a quarry out there. 
 In the colonial days, the British Army used it for artillery practice. 
 When Gus left, did he go east?

 Efrain. 
 Gus. 
 Sorry about that. 
 You must walk carefully. 
 Follow my footsteps exactly.

 Do not take one step further. 
 It's a minefield. We've already had an explosion. 
 Please do not take another step. 
 What are you doing? 
 Lex! Stop! 
 What are you doing? 
 I got it! I got it. 
 This was in my materials. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm gonna use this as a demining needle. 
 Lex, you don't have to do this, Lex. 
 Hey, come on, man. 
 It's all of us or none of us. 
 I respect what you did. 
 It t-takes a lot of balls to cross a minefield to save a girl. 
 I didn't know it was a minefield when I started crossing it. 
 Lex! 
 You're gonna hit one of them with that stick, Lex. 
 No. I just need to be careful. 
 You know, a light touch does not trigger the explosive. 
 Gus, Ava's watch. 
 It was me. 
 What? 
 I stole it. 
 What do you mean? 
 I stole it, Gus. I stole it. 
 Why are you telling me this now? 
 If not now, when? 
 Look, it-it was a long time ago. It was a different life. 
 I owed money all over town, and-and it was an easy fix to a very... difficult problem. 
 I'm-I'm ashamed and embarrassed to admit it, okay? 
 But I can't... I mean, we can't move forward. 
 So you're just telling me some fucked-up sh1t while you're saving my ass, right? 
 Didn't I tell you I was done being manipulated? 
 I am sorry. 
 I just hope I can make it up to you, Gus. 
 That's all. 
 Almost. 
 Here you go. Right here. 
 Come on. 
 You step on it. 
 Come on, man. 
 Sorry. 
 Follow me, all right? 
 I mean, maybe all this studying stuff, maybe it's really paid off. 
 We're proving that we're an effective team. 
 Sounds like Aaron gave you some really good f*cking Kool-Aid. 
 No, I'm serious. This is great. 
 Something like that happens, all your resentment towards each other goes away. 
 You start letting go of secrets. 
 I mean, people pay a fortune to do this at, like, retreats. 
 You plan on telling us where you disappeared to after you got out of quarantine? 
 Did you go to Guatemala? 
 You know what? 
 Yep, that's what I did. 
 I went to Guatemala. 
 Then I came back to help out. 
 What did you do in Guatemala? 
 I went to the embassy. 
 I was trying to get your passports back. 
 What'd you do? 
 Went for a walk.

 500 Euro notes? 
 As far as we know. 
 It's light. 
 Well, um... um... 
 It's all the money we have. 
 So you don't... have all the money? 
 You don't have all the money? 
 Why did no one tell me this before? 
 Well, uh... 
 It was Lawrence. 
 Lawrence knew about this? 
 f*ck! f*ck! God! 
 Jesús needs all of that money! 
 By extension, you need all of that money! 
 Do you underst...

 Tell me right now. 
 Half. 
 We know who has it.

 We're running out of time, so this is what we're gonna do. 
 We're gonna get in this car, and we're gonna think about how we're gonna get that money back, and we are gonna think very f*cking clearly! 
 We'll split up if we have to, but we are going to get that money back. 
 Go! Go! 
 Yeah, go.

 My apologies. 
 But, please, there's a path through my farm, huh?

 Lawrence : Ashenfelter Farms on the Western Highway, and you'll find the money. 
 Why didn't you tell me half of it was missing?
