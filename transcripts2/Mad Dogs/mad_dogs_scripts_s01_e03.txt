 Maybe one of your friends would like to go home instead? 
 They're coming in, I just opened the gate. 
 You let the cops in! 
 What the f*ck! 
 I had no choice. Gus was about to give us up. 
 Go! Stop them! Stop! 
 Come on! 
 Hey, hey, look. 
 Maybe we should just talk out here. 
 Okay. What would you like to say? 
 Lex : Hey. 
 Hello. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 What's going on, Gus? 
 About to ask you the same question, Lex. 
 Um, is there a problem? 
 He won't fit. He won't fit. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Hey, we're gonna cut off his feet. 
 What? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Go get the biggest knife you can find. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Do it! 
 We have started an official investigation into the-the missing boat. 
 Yeah, we... but we told you, uh, that we didn't know anything about any boat. 
 Oh? Because your friend seemed to think you might be able to help. 
 Help... help answer any questions. 
 Didn't know exactly what and, again, we don't anything about a missing boat. 
 That's perfect. All right, you got him? 
 Okay. 
 Wait. 
 Wouldn't it be quicker to... 
 What? 
 No. 
 What? 
 No. 
 What?! 
 Cut off his head? 
 Yeah. Okay, yeah. 
 Great, okay. [exhales] Okay. 
 Ready? Here we go. 
 One... 
 Ugh. 
 Ah, I can't do it! 
 Maybe we can talk inside. 
 Uh, but I know you said, um, you wanted to speak to Milo, right? 
 But, uh, he's not back yet, and the other guys went to bed, so why don't we just, uh, talk out here? 
 [Saw running] 
 [Saw running] 
 [Saw running] 
 It seems the guys have gotten up. 
 [Saw running] 
 To make cocktails or something. 
 Great. 
 Let's have a drink. 
 [Saw running] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Insects trilling] 
 Sophia : You're not in bed. 
 And no cocktails. 
 Uh, she wanted to, uh, ask some more questions about the, um, uh, the missing boat. 
 Hey, didn't know we had company. 
 I will like, if you don't mind, to interview you one by one. 
 Which one of you will talk first? 
 [Insects trilling] 
 ♪ 
 Your name and address, please. 
 What do you do for work? 
 Uh, I-I-I teach. 
 [Water running] 
 I-I used to be a teacher. 
 Now, I mainly... I mainly teach teachers. 
 I... I teach teachers... teaching. 
 Do you enjoy it? 
 It's a job. 
 I-I need ice. 
 [Ice dispenser whirring] 
 I think your fridge is not working or maybe just empty. 
 Milo is in-in Guatemala, in which town? 
 He didn't say. 
 But you asked him. 
 I don't remember the name, but yeah, yeah, we asked him. 
 No, we did not ask because it's none of our business. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Milo's business is in real estate, right? 
 Yes, buying and selling property. 
 That is all he does. 
 No. 
 Milo has his fingers in a lot of pies. 
 Which pies? 
 Hmm, investments, stock speculations. 
 Uh, he and I both, uh, play the markets a little. 
 Stock market? No. No, just, uh, real estate. 
 Which of you would you say is... is closest to Milo? 
 I guess, I am. I mean, I've known him the longest. 
 Lex. 
 Lex. 
 Me. 
 And you, what do you do? 
 I deal in antiques. 
 And up until a few years ago, I practiced law and I'm pretty sure this right here, without a warrant, not exactly legal. 
 You know about law. 
 That's what I just said. 
 You rented a car. 
 From the airport. 
 Yes. 
 So where is it? I didn't see it outside. 
 Well, um, we drove into town last night and, uh, got a little drunk so, um, we left it in town, took a taxi back. 
 So where-where is the car? 
 [Sophia chuckles] 
 The craziest thing. 
 Uh, we can't really remember where it is because we got pretty drunk. 
 [laughing] 
 We had a good time. 
 Would you like us to find it? 
 No, no, that's fine. 
 We have an idea where, I think I know the street. 
 It's got... there's a gas station that's... 
 It's-it's very easy, very easy. 
 No, it's fine. We'll get it. Thank you. 
 Your name and address, please. 
 How about this? 
 How about you, uh, you write down your name and badge number and your superior's name? 
 Because where I'm from, this is not how it's done. 
 You know what, if you're going to question us, I think we should have a lawyer or somebody from the embassy present. 
 I thought your-your friend used to be a lawyer. 
 Gus, right. 
 I'm not sure I want to take legal advice from him. 
 Why you think you need to call a lawyer? 
 Have you done something wrong? 
 No. 
 We're four friends on vacation. 
 And you're very close. 
 Yep, super tight. 
 No. 
 Some of us are closer than others. 
 Close? Us? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay. We know you have plane reservations, leave on Monday night, the 6:00 PM flight via Houston. 
 You tell her that, too, Gus? 
 While we continue our investigation, I must ask you not to leave Belize before then. 
 What if we do? 
 You will be detained at the airport. 
 Why? Because of some missing boat we know nothing about? 
 How can I explain? 
 You're not in the United States. 
 The person the boat belongs to is very savage. 
 We are trying to solve a crime, but we are also trying to protect whoever stole the boat because clearly they do not understand what they did. 
 Must be worth a lot of money then. 
 Jesús is a man of principle. 
 Whether he's owed a lot or a little, he will seek atonement. 
 Doesn't matter if the person is here in Belize or even in the United States. 
 He has many associates. 
 When Milo returns, ask him to call me. 
 Ay, and don't worry, Lex, I'll find your car. 
 ♪ 
 What's she talking about, find our car? 
 She saw the rental car keys on the table. 
 She asked where it was. 
 What'd you say? 
 I said we lost it. 
 Why'd you say that? 
 I didn't know what to say so I said we didn't know where it was. Who are you calling? Who are you calling? 
 Operator, I would like to be connected to the American embassy, please. 
 By the way, who opened up the damn gate? 
 I did. 
 Oh, of course you did. Why doesn't that surprise me? 
 I'm sorry, what are you trying to say, Gus? 
 I'm saying that for as long as we've known you, you've always been the one to do retarded sh1t like that that we... 
 ...have to clean up. 
 We heard everything you were saying to her. 
 What-what... you-you-you-you think that I was... 
 English. 
 Option one. 
 They're closed. Want me to leave a message. 
 Then leave one. Leave one. 
 Okay, My-my name is... 
 Don't... 
 I'm an American citizen. 
 Uh, I-I came here with a friend-a friend... 
 Wait... 
 There was this-this cat. 
 How the hell am I going to explain this sh1t? 
 Wait a second, wait a second. 
 She's just gone to... to look for a car rented in our names. 
 My name. 
 With millions of euros of drug money sitting in the trunk. 
 Do you realize we have less than four hours to return the boat? 
 [Bell rings] 
 Hey, I-I don't-I don't know if you remember me... 
 You don't think I remember you? 
 Yeah, I-I rented a car from you earlier. 
 I misplaced the keys and I was wondering if you had an extra set. 
 $40 U.S. 
 I'll put it on your bill. 
 So, um, what was all this retarded sh1t you had to clean up? I'm-I'm curious. 
 Really? Right here. 
 Why not? 
 Totaling a friend's motorcycle and asking us to lie and say that it was stolen. 
 Asking us to cover for you because you're too damn hungover to make it to class. 
 Asking us to lend you our CDs and clothes and-and- and-and apartments knowing that it'd probably end up trashed or lost. 
 Vouching for you. 
 Vouching for me. Wow. 
 Interesting that you'd bring that up 'cause here's a vouch I can think of that didn't exactly pan out for me. 
 Don't you think we have more pressing things to deal with right now? 
 Like getting the boat back or dealing with this damn car that you just alerted the police to? 
 Thank you. 
 Southside Construction ring any bells? 
 What? 
 You don't remember? 
 I was in line for a management gig. 
 I aced the interviews, then I asked you for a letter of recommendation because you knew them. 
 Yes, they were clients. I gave them a letter. 
 Got it, guys, let's go. 
 Well, this doesn't look suspicious. 
 Exactly, so let's hurry it up. 
 Is it just me or does it bother anyone else that this money is short? 
 Does it bother anyone else that Jesús has associates in the U.S.? 
 Does it bother anybody else that the cops may show up at any moment? 
 How much did you give fender bender woman? 
 I didn't give fender bender woman anything. 
 She took it. 
 How much? 
 Uh, uh, a stack. At least a full stack. 
 I saw that. 
 That's ten grand. 
 We are not giving this money back ten grand short. 
 Follow me, please.

 Hey, do you think Milo knew what might happen when he invited us here? 
 I wouldn't put it past him to take us all down with him. 
 Lex : No, no. 
 I-I think it was a cry for help. 
 I think he knew he was in trouble, he was scared. 
 He wanted his homies around him. 
 Joel : Yeah, like I'm his homie. 
 Where's he going? 
 Why are we stopping? Where's he going? 
 Two minutes. 
 I'm not here to cause any distress or trouble, but I think it's important you hear what I have to say. 
 What the f*ck is he doing? 
 Oh, I think he's putting the squeeze on fender bender woman. 
 I know you're not stupid. 
 You know what that cash is about. 
 I'm not here to pretend that it's something else, but my concern is with that cash comes a whole lot of trouble. 
 This concern, it's for you or for me? 
 For both. Look, I'm not a criminal. 
 My buddies out there are not criminals. 
 You think I couldn't tell that? 
 Somehow we stumbled into this cosmic f*ck up and for whatever crazy ass reason, you've stumbled into it, too. 
 I'm sorry, but if you don't give back that cash, I promise you that we are both in danger. 
 That's all I got. 
 She's giving us back the money. 
 What? 
 What? 
 Wha... 
 All right, I'm going with him. 
 Wait, I don't think this is such a good idea. 
 You don't even know where you're going. 
 Okay, we'll wait here. 
 Gus : Coming to give me backup? 
 Lex : Yeah, just like you did when I needed that job. 
 That was four f*cking years ago. 
 I know exactly when it was. 
 I-I had a deposit on an apartment, which I lost. 
 Was gonna get a company car, had an opportunity to get my sh1t together after Kayla and all the other crap that went down, and all I needed from... Aah! Ick. 
 Mind the open sewer. 
 f*ck! 
 Okay. 
 You know what I think we should do? 
 Go sit outside the embassy and wait for it to open. 
 And just leave them here? What, what do you mean? 
 Well, obviously wait for them to come back. 
 Assuming they do come back. 
 [Music playing] 
 All I needed was a letter. 
 I gave them one. 
 Is that right? 
 I wrote the letter. 
 I should know, Lex. 
 And what did you say? 
 I'm-I'm very curious. 
 I said the typical sh1t that you would say in those kinds of letters. 
 [dog barking] 
 We're here. 
 Come in.

 Hey.

 Shaved ice, cool you down, man? 
 Uh, hey, we don't have any money so, uh, why don't you just leave? 
 Uh, seriously, we don't have any cash. 
 Here you go, a present from Belize. 
 Take care, man. 
 Thank you. 
 [Cup clatters] 
 Good.

 Do you have any idea what ten grand would mean to these people? 
 Do you have any idea how much my hands and feet mean to me? 
 [Women shouting] 
 My roof you're under! In my house! 
 [Dog barking] 
 Grans! 
 Did you get it? 
 Yeah. 
 No. 
 Most of it. 
 She gave us $6,500. 
 What do you mean? 
 Her grandmother spent the rest. 
 Oh, bullshit! 
 No, I don't-I don't buy it. 
 Did you-did you threaten her, huh? 
 What are you guys, men? 
 Yes, that's-that's what we are. 
 We're civilized men. 
 So wait, we're still short $3,500. 
 Yeah. 
 Can we grab it from an ATM? 
 Oh, yeah. How much can you grab out of an ATM, Lex? 
 I don't know. 
 How much can you grab from an ATM, Gus? 
 ATMs are traceable. 
 You can wire money anonymously. 
 Okay, so who can we ask to, uh, send us 3,500 bucks in the middle of the night? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Well, I know who Gus called the last time he needed cash in a hurry. 
 Oh, let's go and bring that up again. 
 Look, I'm making a point. 
 The people we all turn to are us and we're all here. 
 If I ask anybody I know to wire me money to Central America in the middle of the night, they're gonna think... 
 Nobody will, okay? So forget it. 
 What? 
 What? 
 Say it. 
 Say what? 
 I can get the money and you all know it. 
 All right.

 How could you not know your wife's cell number? 
 'Cause it was on my phone. 
 Who memorizes cell phone numbers? 
 What do I do? 
 Yeah, can you just hold on a second, please? 
 Just one second.

 Can you please look up a cell phone number for me? 
 Is that... can you do that? 
 Yeah, but it's in... I can't remember anybody's number to call and ask for her number.

 What... Milo? Yeah, he's fine. 
 He's great, mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, he was actually saying I should-I should, um, I should bring you down here, right? 
 And I will. Of course, I will. 
 I... b... I just said that I would, didn't I? 
 What? 
 We should bury him at sea. 
 Hmm? 
 Milo. 
 You know, when we take the money back, we'll... we'll take his body and on the way back to the marina, we... you know? 
 We can't leave him in the freezer. 
 Look, I-I-I need you to wire me some money. 
 Just because I do. 
 It's a business deal that, um, Milo's bringing me in on. 
 Bringing all of us in on. 
 Why are you bringing that up? 
 By definition, half of it is mine, too. 
 Helena, we... can you just do this for me, please? 
 Because I'm f*cking asking you to! 
 Are they ready? 
 Not yet. 
 Oh.

 I had her wire some extra so we'd all have a few bucks. 
 Thank you.

 Yeah, 20 minutes ago. 
 You know, I don't buy all that stuff that Milo told you. 
 And I realize I didn't have a chance to say it at the time, but I'm sorry- for your marriage and the last job, things not working out for you. 
 Thanks. 
 But I think he was right. 
 My life is a failure. 
 Well, you still got your kids. 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, I know you don't see them much, but that's just a phase. 
 They'll come around, you know? 
 Hmm, yeah, maybe. 
 You know, people say there is no greater experience than having a kid, but-but when you have one, it's like-it's like consigning your- your relationship that you had with your partner to- to history. 
 Like, when-when a-when a man has a child, he-he creates his biggest rival, you know. 
 A person who his wife loves more than him. 
 I don't know. 
 Well, everything happens for a reason, right? 
 I don't think it does.

 No, I wasn't. 
 Well, can we just start the boat, please? 
 I know what you put in that letter. 
 Still talking about the f*cking letter. 
 What letter? 
 Four years ago, my big break. 
 All Mr. Big Shot here had to do was write a simple letter of recommendation, you know. 
 Say a few nice words on my behalf. 
 I wrote your f*cking letter. 
 Oh, my God, I can't believe we're having this conversation now! 
 I know what was in the f*cking letter, Gus. 
 Applicant is unreliable. 
 He has a history of instability. 
 You want me to keep going 'cause I can quote that m*therf*cker line for line. 
 That letter was confidential for Mr. Mikey McFarlane's eyes only. 
 Yeah, well, guess what. 
 Mikey McFarlane was just in Grand Rapids and he told me how you f*cked me, college buddy. 
 You have any idea what happened to me after I missed out on that? 
 Huh? 
 Yeah. I do. 
 And it made me feel completely vindicated for what I wrote because you went back to drinking and drugging for God knows how many years, so I would say that unreliable is a pretty accurate description. 
 He was an important client who relied on me for good advice. 
 Great. 
 Can we-can we-can we just go, please? 
 No, no, no, look... 
 Guys, guys, come on. 
 Listen. 
 No, he thinks-he thinks that I wanted to write that letter. 
 You think that I enjoyed that. 
 Did you think that when you were homeless and crashing on our couches that I stopped for a second and thought to myself that I might be responsible? 
 I did what I had to do for me and my client. 
 And goddamn it, I still stand by it, Lex. 
 I am sorry. 
 I am really f*cking sorry. 
 Can I suggest for now you accept his apology and we can at least try to make this deadline that is now just-just- just one hour away from running out? 
 Cobi, check the front. 
 Make sure I'm not gonna hit anything. 
 Yeah.

 I don't think we're gonna make the deadline now. 
 Right. 
 Again, just my opinion, but I don't think we should hang out here very long. 
 He's right. 
 Maybe when-when we hand the money back... we can describe where the boat is, then Jesús will-will cut us some slack on account of not really being boat people. 
 Well, what about Milo? 
 I say we just, uh, put him back in the water. 
 Okay. Really consider this before you react. 
 We cut off Milo's hands and we leave him on the boat. 
 Look, Jesús cuts of hands and feet, right? 
 Milo's already lost his feet so we just leave him on the boat and then it'll look like a drug deal gone bad. 
 Then, if somebody finds him, they won't be looking for us and that might buy us some time. 
 That's... actually... a smart idea.

 No. 
 Do you know who uses 500 euro notes? 
 Drug dealers, people like Jesús. 
 Maybe this is his money. 
 Do you think it is wise to be spending his money? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You, or... somebody from your family, has been exchanging 500 euro notes in town. 
 You're not in trouble. 
 All I need to know is, did you get these notes from the Americans? 
 [Latin music plays] 
 No police boat. 
 Look, man, I'm not trying to be funny here, but do we really believe that guy is a cop? 
 Why? 
 Because he's four foot tall. 
 Don't they have some kind of height requirement? 
 He said, "We are the police." 
 Yeah, but just because he said he's a cop doesn't mean... 
 Are we sure it was a police boat? 
 It had blue lights. 
 Police decals? 
 Yeah, yeah, I think. 
 'Cause it-it-it's just she said she's a cop. 
 Yeah, but I never seen a cop behave the way that she does. 
 Look, I think he's a cop and she's a cop. 
 I'm telling you, that guy is not a cop, okay? 
 What kind of country has a munchkin-size police force? 
 So what are you saying? That neither of them is a cop? 
 No, they're both cops. 
 Hey, look, I think they're working together. 
 I don't think they're working together. 
 They both want the boat, right? 
 Yeah, they both want the boat, but for-but for different reasons, I think. 
 Whatever the reason, we can't afford to give this money to the wrong people. 
 Right. 
 All right. 
 Well, he's not here, all right, so... 
 [waves crashing] 
 [Waves crashing] 
 [Waves crashing] 
 [Gasping] 
 We got to be careful not to get dehydrated. 
 [Groaning] 
 [Grunting] 
 Thanks, man. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Grunting] 
 Yeah, 'cause we wouldn't want something bad to happen to us on this trip, right? 
 [Cobi grunting] 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 [Grunting] 
 [Gasping] 
 Touch it and I blow his face off! 
 Move away from the table. 
 [Groans] 
 He can't breathe! 
 You're choking him! 
 I told you to bring us the boat. 
 It's in the lagoon. 
 We will show where it is. 
 It got stuck. 
 Sir, we tried to bring it back! 
 Will you please let that man breathe! 
 [Grunts] 
 We have your money. Okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right here. 
 Here. Here. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Panting] 
 Go that way! 
 That way. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Hold up! 
 Hey! 
 In here! 
 Hey, hey! Hey, hey. Hey. 
 Wait. 
 We-we know you're in there. 
 So-so come out with your hands up. 
 The Cat : f*ck off. 
 Man, give me this. 
 Listen to me. 
 I'm giving you three seconds to come out of there or I am going to light this motherfucking closet up, you hear me? 
 Three, two... 
 One! 
 Do it, do it. 
 [Quietly] I can't. I can't. 
 Hey, buddy, look, we don't want to hurt you. 
 I do! 
 I'm going to f*ck you up! 
 Who do you work for? 
 Do you work for Jesús? 
 Who sent you? 
 The Cat : Suck my cock! 
 This isn't really working. 
 Screw this. 
 [Screaming] 
 No, get him off. Hold him! 
 Hold him! Get him off! 
 [Shouting] 
 Let me shoot him! Let me kill him. 
 I got him. 
 Nobody's killing anybody! 
 Let's deep fry this little m*therf*cker. 
 Hey, let's waterboard him! 
 What? 
 No, no! We need him! 
 Okay. Let's take him downstairs. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, pick him up. 
 Yeah! Fucker. 
 Let's drop him on his head. 
 No, we need him. 
 Ah! 
 We have him and we have the money. 
 Okay. 
 So we got leverage. 
 I still think we should we should torture him a bit. 
 Why do you keep saying that? 
 So he knows we mean business. 
 Grab a chair. 
 [Growling] 
 Simmer down! Hey! 
 Sit! Knock it off! 
 Give me his legs! 
 Get some rope or tape or something. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Aah, little fucker just bit me! 
 Bite him back! 
 [Screams] 
 I can't find anything! 
 Get-get twine! 
 Wait, how about this?

 All right! 
 Wait, wait, we gotta... we gotta lock him up someplace secure while we go to the embassy. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 The well! We put him in the well. 
 Good idea! 
 Yeah. 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up. 
 I don't think that might be the best place. 
 No, the well! 
 Well, well, well, well, well! 
 All right, bring it over here. 
 Close your mouth. 
 [Growling] 
 All right, get over here.
