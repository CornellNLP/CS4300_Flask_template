 Come on. This way, please. 
 Whoa. Right there. 
 Quickly. Right this way. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Take the family to Nurse Obar. 
 Watch this. 
 Okay. Thank you. Cuidado. 
 Okay. [Speaks Spanish] 
 [coughs] 
 Whoa! Who's taking my damn picture? 
 It's just procedure. 
 Procedure of what? 
 Okay, headache, back pains, stomach ache, rash... anyone? 
 Are you the doctor? 
 What is this place? 
 Quarantine. 
 You have entered a variola smallpox zone. 
 Smallpox? 
 We barely left the dock. 
 We couldn't have entered an infected zone. 
 Wait. Guatemala has smallpox? 
 We're trying to stop it from reaching Guatemala. 
 Our boats brought you back to Belize. 
 I thought smallpox was eradicated. 
 Yeah. Isn't it like extinct? 
 Tell that to the Chief of Staff. 
 So we must take your blood samples because you were in an infection zone. 
 You're very lucky. 
 How's that? 
 Because if you have it, there is still a chance that we can save your lives. 
 But more importantly, if you have it, by being here, you are saving the lives of others. 
 [speaks Spanish] 
 What's that for? 
 Why is mine a different color? 
 What kind of doctor are you? 
 I am a nurse. 
 So where are the doctors? 
 They're very busy. So are we. 
 Go. Go, go, go. 
 [whimpering, indistinct chattering] 
 Please follow the light. 
 If you have not been processed, please stay in line. 
 [coughing, indistinct chatter] 
 f*ck. 
 That little yellow vaccine book the doctor gave me is back at the villa. 
 You got vaccine shots? 
 Yeah. I think that smallpox was one of the shots I got. It must have been. 
 Joel, was smallpox one of the shots you got? 
 I don't remember. 
 Were we supposed to get shots? Did you get shots? 
 I can't do needles, man. I took herbal drops. 
 Milo never said I needed shots or drops. 
 Dude, you always get shots. 
 Haven't you ever been to a tropical island before? 
 It's not an island. 
 But when you're a kid, isn't smallpox one of the shots they give you? 
 That's right. The mark that you get. 
 That's like the all-purpose singing and dancing vaccination deal, right? 
 That one? Is that it? 
 What? Like that? 
 Where? 
 That mark? 
 Right here. Right here. 
 That's a mark. That's a mark. 
 I got that mark, too. 
 I'm like double protected then. 
 Dude, that's a mole. 
 What? 
 That's a mole. 
 You gotta get that checked, bro. 
 No, not that. That's a birthmark. 
 It doesn't matter. Smallpox has mutated, and there's no vaccine. 
 Come with me. 
 Cobi : Where are you from? 
 Like, around here? Belize, Belize City? 
 Originally, I am from Chile. Why? 
 Just curious. 
 Um, don't touch that. 
 That-that... that belongs to all of us, so I'll just put all our names on it. 
 We can only put one name per item. 
 Why? 
 Because if you have something of value in there and not all of you are released, then you cannot get it back. 
 So I will write your name on it. 
 Okay, well, forget it. Don't worry about it. 
 We have a pastor who comes in the mornings if you would like to speak to him. 
 A pastor? What? 
 No. f*ck, no. 
 Please fill these out. 
 I really do need to use the phone. 
 We have a pastor who visits every morning. 
 Oh, no, thanks. 
 I'm... I'm not religious. 
 No? 
 Why did you say it like that? 
 Because you look like a guy who has a lot on his mind. 
 Why do you have to do that? 
 Random sample. 
 And you picked me because... 
 Every 50th patient. 
 Where does that sample go? 
 Clinic. You know? Yeah? 
 Anonymous. No records, just data. 
 Andre, the father of the twins that came in with us... 
 Mm-hmm? 
 He sneezed on me. 
 Is he sick? 
 He sneezed on just you or also your friends? 
 Just me, I think. 
 I'll tell the doctor. 
 Well, can I tell the doctor? 
 I mean, when do I get to see an actual doctor? 
 If you have smallpox... 
 Uh-huh. 
 Then you see a doctor. 
 So you really don't want to see her. 
 Sir? 
 No. 
 I am cooperating with you. 
 Sir? 
 You are not cooperating... 
 I tried to explain to him. 
 Listen, I have two girls, and I need to use a phone. 
 We understand. You need to lower your volume to a calm level. 
 I need to use a phone. 
 You cannot call when in quarantine. 
 Why? 
 It can cause a panic. 
 Do you have kids? 
 Not anymore. 
 We have a pastor who visits in the mornings if you would like to speak to him. 
 Does that pastor have a roaming plan? 
 I must know where you have been and who you have met with. 
 Here in Belize, where do you stay? 
 Belize City. 
 Hotel name? 
 No, uh, with a friend. 
 Well, we will need to contact them. 
 Please write their number. 
 Uh, he... our friend's gone. 
 Where? 
 Well, he's just gone. 
 Uh, he went to Guatemala. 
 Do you have a contact number for him? 
 Sure. 
 How did you get to the boat we found you on? 
 We hitchhiked from Belize City. 
 Lex : Hitchhiked? No, that's not correct. 
 I don't care what happens. 
 I gotta tell you the truth. 
 We got a ride from a woman who worked at... 
 She was driving us to Guatemala. She died. 
 She's dead? 
 Yes. 
 She was sick? What were her symptoms? 
 She fell. She fell into a very deep chasm. 
 I'm pretty sure she's dead. 
 So you're not sure? 
 We didn't go down there to look. 
 I mean, we should have, but we couldn't because it was very deep. 
 But, no, she's-she's... she's not alive. 
 So this was close to where we pick you up? 
 Yes. 
 Did she complain of dizziness? 
 No. 
 Then how did she fall? 
 I don't know. Maybe she slipped. 
 There were all these goats that... 
 She's still down there. 
 Do you understand that? 
 Somebody's gotta go and get her body. 
 I have medical authority only, not police. 
 Okay. Call it a medical emergency. 
 Just get somebody to go down there. 
 I can only worry about smallpox for now. 
 We have a pastor who visits in the morning if you would like to talk to him. 
 Yeah, yeah, I would like that.

 Hey, Erica. 
 It's Gus. 
 You back in Chicago? 
 No. 
 Are you still in Belize? 
 I-I believe so. Um... 
 How are you? Are you okay? 
 Erica : It's not safe for you here. 
 Go home. 
 I know it's not safe, but, um... look, I don't have a passport, and, uh, my friend, Lex, he's with me, and neither one of us have passports and... we're lost. 
 Well, you're smart. You'll find a way. 
 No, we're really lost. 
 Like, I-I have no idea what to do. 
 Gus... 
 All right, look around you... what do you see? 
 Uh, ocean... um, P.G. Lionfish Pub. 
 That's Punta Gorda. You're still in Belize. 
 [seagulls screeching] 
 All right, give me the address, and I'll come get you. 
 Yeah, yeah, you would do that for me? 
 Of course.

 If anonymity is a priority, we have a minor issue. 
 Our system is governed by SWIFT. 
 Yeah, I know all about SWIFT. 
 You are an accountant? 
 A financial consultant, wealth management. 
 Wait, now this is a payment order from my corporation to my account, so why would there be an issue? 
 Well, you made a similar payment order three days ago in Belize for Angel Gibson. 
 [sighs] 
 Angel. 
 So our only option here is to put a hold on my deposit? 
 How long? 
 Not long. 
 I will call you personally when the time comes. 
 Okay. 
 Um... you can reach, let's see... [mumbling] 
 All right, you can reach me at this number. 
 Okay? 
 Oh, listen, uh, what's the best hotel in town?

 [woman] Hello? 
 Hello? 
 [sigh] Hi, Helena. 
 Where are you? 
 Still here. 
 I, um... 
 Helena, it's... 
 Cobi? 
 It's been a real nightmare, but, uh, I'm fine, you know, so... 
 Okay. 
 "Okay"? 
 When are you coming back? 
 I was supposed to be back a day and a half ago. 
 Yeah, you called a few days ago to wire money for a business opportunity. 
 I assumed you were staying longer, and you did. 
 Joel says hi. 
 How-how is he? 
 Have you spoken to him? 
 Helena : Not recently. 
 Cobi : Really? When? 
 I don't know when. 
 You don't remember... 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 You don't remember the, uh, the last time you spoke to him? 
 Helena : No. Why? 
 Oh, 'cause he said that you guys had... like, lunch. 
 [ringing continues] 
 Actually, lunches. 
 [ringing stops] 
 When he came into town, he called me for lunch. So what? 
 You f*cking him? 
 No. 
 Oh, you haven't f*cked him yet, but you want to, is that it? 
 Is Joel there? Put him on the phone. 
 Nah, he told me everything. 
 Well, if he told you we slept together, he's lying. 
 Are you unhappy, is that it? 
 You know what, I'll talk to you when you get home. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 Wait. 
 Like what... 
 [dial tone drones] 
 [phone beeps off] 
 f*ck. 
 [cell phone beeps, buzzes] 
 [phone beeps] 
 [recording]: Cobi, it-it's Joel. 
 I'm in Belize City, at least I think I am. 
 I've been, uh, uh, taken, um, captured. 
 Kidnapped, wh-whatever you call it. 
 I'm serious. 
 Uh, this guy wants the money, all of it. 
 He already has what I took, and he wants the rest, so... 
 Uh... call me-call me back at this number and... there will be further...
