 Margaret :  Previously on "Graves"... 
 Mr. President, I'm gonna have to ask you to go back to the house. 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Everybody back! 
 Jesus! 
 God damn it, I did not want this to happen. 
 I've become unshackled. 
 My new guiding principle is total spontaneity. 
 Car. Car! 
 (horn honks) 
 It's just this family. They are so dysfunctional. 
 To nipples. 
 All : To nipples. 
 Without 'em, tits wouldn't have a point. 
 (laughing) 
 Margaret :  Jeremy is coming home today. 
 I don't know what I'm doing, Dad. 
 I'm just happy you're home. 
 Help Ramona feed those needy people. 
 (moaning) 
 This is for you. 
 I will! 
 We need you to run against Nash. 
 Richard, they asked me to run for the Senate. 
 (opera playing) 
 (chanting) 
 Homophobia has got to go. 
 Hey, hey, ho, ho. Homophobia has got to go. 
 You have to go. You're going. 
 It's a wedding, darling. You love weddings. 
 They don't want me there, Maggie. 
 Lawrence has been writing your speeches for years. 
 He's family. You are going with me. 
 It's a homosexual wedding, for God's sake. 
 I'm the anti-gay anti-Christ to those people. 
 My God, every demographic that isn't a white male over 50 has protested you at some point. 
 You're doing this for me because it's important to your wife who you love and adore and support, dear. 
 If I don't want to walk in front of a gay liberated firing squad that's got an ax to grind, I shouldn't have to. 
 Oh, Lord. 
 Oh. 
 (theme music playing) 
 Summer :  Ma'am, we just got a call from "Good Day Santa Fe." 
 Another appearance request for Jeremy. 
 Oh. 
 It'd be a sit-down with him for their local Sunday show. 
 The First Family son back from the war kind of thing. 
 It's good to get the Graves family back out there in a positive way. 
 Counter what the tabloids are doing to Olivia and Richard's recent escapades. 
 Ah, enough said. 
 Hey! 
 God, would some underwear be too much to ask for? 
 We're not primates. 
 Yeah, we are, Mom. 
 Oh, sweetheart, before I go, I wanted to tell you that "Good Day Santa Fe" called. 
 They want to do an interview with you. 
 Pass. 
 You know what's so funny is that the media has always loved you. 
 Even as a boy. Do you remember sitting on Dan Rather's lap at Daddy's White House Christmas chat with the nation? 
 I was on that man's lap for way too long. 
 I don't want you to feel pressured if it's too much too soon. 
 Thank you. 
 But I know you're going to be great. 
 Wait, what? 
 The president and I are going to Palm Springs for Lawrence Mills' wedding. 
 Yes, ma'am. Ramona's packing his tux as we speak. 
 And Richard? 
 Watching her. 
 Muttering obscenities under his breath. 
 Something about they're gonna hang him from a disco ball. 
 Not sure. 
 All right, you're gonna stay here. 
 Jeremy's gonna appear on "Good Day Santa Fe." 
 I've confirmed all the questions with the show. 
 You need to help him prepare. 
 Rehearse him. He has focus issues. 
 Make sure he gets there early. 
 Of course. Whatever I can do to help. 
 (sighs)

 I'm in Albuquerque on my way to LA for business and, well, I stopped here on purpose because I need to see you. 
 So come here to Albuquerque. 
 I'm staying at the Hyatt, room 542. 
 Please. I love you, Liv. I really do.

Friends from Washington. Well, good networking for you, dear. Okay, if this foul mood of yours as of late is because I've been asked to run for the Senate, I'm just still exploring it, honey. I could do a lot of good. I could help people. Maggie, it could lead right back to 1600 Pennsylvania. The things I did in those rooms, that I allowed, the decisions I made... I don't know. Jesus, Maggie, I can't breathe. Honey, take it easy. Honey, look at me. It's just the Senate. And if I decide to run, it would mean a lot to know that you were on board. You know, I've seen so many of my dad's body men come and go, and I hate to break it to you, man, but there's just no way you're gonna last. No, I will. I believe in him. Come on, still? Yeah, more so. President Graves fought for American idealism. The power of the individual. Oh, you're one of those. Your father believed in people. That they had the strength of mind and character to be able to find their own life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And it worked until it didn't. Shut up. I'm getting f*cking Bell's palsy just listening to you. Yeah, I'm sorry. I tend to run away with myself on the subject. No sh1t. Okay, so going over these for the morning show... No, no, f*ck that. Let's talk about the party I'm throwing tonight. No, no, no, no, no. No party. Not tonight. No, we have to... Look, I haven't seen any of my friends in years, okay? I just... I need something to reconnect with. Besides, the invites have already gone out. And you're going to help. What? No, no. I really... I really shouldn't. Isaiah. Hi. Hey. Holy sh1t! How hot are you? I'm sorry, that was rude. That is so weird. Excuse me, Jeremy Graves. Yeah, I know who you are, Top Gun. I actually have to clock in 'cause I'm late again, but we should catch up later, Iz. Yeah, sure. Okay. Sorry. Iz? ♪ Stay up late, watch the... ♪ If you go find me a glass of champagne, I'll find Lawrence. Sure. If you're comfortable. Oh, I'm fine. All right. Look how beautiful. Excuse me. Mr. President. Good to meet you. Whiskey neat and a champagne. (exhales) Mr. President. Oh, how's it hanging, Barney? Or is it at constant attention at these type of things? Good to see you're still the piece of sh1t I know and hate. President Graves. Congressman. (music playing) ♪ Keep on keeping on ♪

♪ Oh, baby, please ♪ 
♪ Keep on keeping on ♪ 
♪ 'Cause I'm drowning for you today... ♪ (knocking) ♪ 'Cause I'm drowning for you today... ♪ You came. I am so happy for both of you. We couldn't be happier that you're here, Maggie. So where's the boss man? Probably somewhere trying to make sure he doesn't get any gay on him. Alan! He's fetching me a drink. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to mingle. All right, babe. So, tell me. Is the rumor true? You gonna make a run? Oh, my God, I need them to be true. That Nash m*therf*cker is climbing in the polls. We're still just considering it. But if I do decide to go forward, I would need you on my team, Lawrence. Press secretary, speechwriter. Help me land on a message. I can't even imagine doing this without you. Well, I'm flattered, Margaret, but... Mags, here you are. Oh, thank you, darling. Some hell of a night you're putting on here, pal. Well, I never thought it could happen. No, it's so much more than just a wedding. You know, it still feels like we're taking some kind of stand. Fighting the system. (snorts) Anyway, it means a lot that you're here, sir. And I'll see you inside in a bit, okay? Are you okay, honey? Oh, yeah. I'm... yeah. I just... I'm fine. I... I... I'm going this way. Itching. (moaning) (gasping) This is so strange, you know? But I like seeing you here in my bed. I like it here, too. There's a definite... smell. I don't know. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It smells... I don't know. Poor? Yes! Babe, you don't get it. I like the smell of poverty. It's different. It's the opposite. It's the 99%. I'm just so used to being controlled, you know? Worried about how I'm being perceived. Scared shitless that I'm not gonna live up to some fairy tale of my family. A fairy tale I didn't even f*cking write. This... this... I'm writing this. (door opens) (sighs) A girl's got to pee. (groans) If you do run, Maggie, and I hope that you do, I can't come along for the ride. I'm so sorry, but everything has been about career for so long. And Alan wants me in DC. He's in line for head of oncology at Inova. And I have an offer that I'm going to accept that's gonna keep me in town. We're talking about adopting. I mean, can you imagine me a dad? The best. Tell me you understand. I just feel a little alone with this decision and I wanted to know I would have a familiar face if I do go through with it, you know? Anyway, I'm so happy for you. 
 
 (music playing) (indistinct chatter) This is actually very nice. Nice? Yeah, everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. It's a very convivial atmosphere. Let me tell you something, okay? Every single one of these people showed up on time. None of them have even touched the keg that you nearly died getting into the back of my truck. I don't get it. That brunette over there who used to be a f*cking baller, by the way, she brought a bottle of Prosecco and called it "champs" and then asked if I could hook her up with a Chelsea Clinton interview for her f*cking blog. Chel... can you? That girl over there used to give a hand job that was indisputable proof that Jesus was a white man. She brought hummus and pita chips and can only do a stop-by because they're expecting their fourth any day now. Who the f*ck are these people? There's at least three guys here I'd consider catfishing. Oh, thank God she came. Sam? What is Sammy doing here? I invited her. What? When? Why? You know he's gonna bang your girlfriend, right? What? No, she's not my girlfriend. (phone rings) What are you talking about? This is Summer. Summer? Where the hell have you been? Bathroom. I don't want to talk about it. Oh, what's the matter? Are you all right? I just... I asked Lawrence if I did run if he would help me and he said he can't. Which is okay. Lawrence and I met through mutual friends and I have wanted to marry this man from the moment I laid eyes on him. It's taken some time to get here. We've overcome so much. So many obstacles have been put in our way. Men and laws trying to prevent this union. Mountains we've had to climb over. Okay, easy, fella. Anyway, I am not the speechwriting half of this power couple, so I thought I'd do it a different way. Maestro. (piano playing) Thank you. Yeah. Congratulations, fellas. ♪ There you are looking just the way you did ♪ 
♪ Last time I touched you... ♪ Okay. ♪ Here I am ♪ 
♪ Trying not to get all tangled back up inside of you ♪ 
♪ Looks like we made it... ♪ You're beautiful. ♪ Lift each other on the way ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're here and we're queer ♪ ♪ Ooh... ♪ (light laughter) ♪ Hello, sir ♪ 
♪ Wow, you sure do look handsome in person ♪ 
♪ Are you with her? ♪ 
♪ 'Cause it didn't seem that way last night for certain ♪ 
♪ Oh, does she love you ♪ 
♪ The way that you loved me? ♪ 
♪ And where the hell was she ♪ 
♪ When we were K-I-S-S-I-N-G? ♪ f*ck me. ♪ Looks like we made it. ♪ If I'm being honest with myself... that's one of my forever goals... it was never gonna work out with William. You know what I mean? I mean, sometimes I feel like I'm wearing a suicide vest of emotions. You know what I mean? Not like... not like I'm suicidal. I mean, okay, once in high school. That was like a pact. Everyone bailed. I just mean, like, an emotional vest itself, you know? It's just like on me all the time. And then, boom, insecurity is over here, resentment over here, mommy issues just like all over the f*cking place. You know? f*ck. My therapist says I process out loud too much. William used to say I could never shut up. Am I being so annoying? No. You're complicated. (chuckles) And you, Olivia, are  perfectamente complicada. Perfectly complicated. Mr. President. President Graves, I would love it if you would join us boys for a drink. He would be honored. (sighs) Just go to the bar. All right. (phone chimes) Hey, Summer. Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but I have Jonathan Dalton on the line. The Jonathan Dalton. Could you ask him if he could call back on my cell phone in about 30 minutes? Yes, ma'am. I think GI Jane's enjoying his bar mitzvah. My job depends on getting him to do something  he has flat out refused to do  and I have no idea how to change his mind. You know, in his biography President Graves says you have to be able to reach your peers, people your age, since they're your future constituency. Well, soldier boy seems about your age and I'd say he's peer adjacent, so find a way to reach him. You make that sound so easy. Well, shouldn't it be? You mind? The more the merrier. Everyone's leaving. Thank God. Rounds in the morning. I have to relieve the sitter. I'm gonna turn into a pumpkin. Blah, blah, blah. Bye, guys. Hey, drive safe, okay? You're staying, right? Please tell me you're staying. I could use some company. And by company I mean pity s*x. Oh, my God. Okay. So I know that you just got back from serving our country, so respect. Thank you. And maybe you're just not hearing yourself, but you kind of sound like a douchebag. That guy's got rounds? That means that someone is sick and he's going to make them feel better. That chick's got to relieve the sitter? That means there's kids at home missing their mom and dad and they put all that on hold to come here and say, "Welcome home. Real glad you didn't die out there." Now I get it. The struggle is real. But people grow up. It's what happens. Also, he's super smart and just trying to do his job,  so stop being a pain in the ass and just listen to him. By the way, I'm going to a really rad concert Friday night if you want to hang. Yeah, sure. I'd love to hang. Okay. Okay. Peace, y'all. Peace. Oh, and tell the president next time we're drinking, I pick the bar. Dad knows her? (chuckles) Dad knows her? (music playing) Hey, ho, hey, ho. Homophobia has got to go. (groans) Tell me the truth, Graves. Why do you give two sh1ts if two men get married? Easy, honey. Come on. At my age, any sh1t's a victory. You don't have any idea what your policies did, do you? Okay, you know what? I think we've reached... Relax. I'm fine. We're just two grown men having a conversation. Isn't that right, Mr. President? Lunatic. Alan, Jesus. You want to know what chaps my ass? Is giving a history lesson to a bunch of self-righteous gay men who don't know how good they've had it. I may be a dinosaur on this subject, but I believe what I believe. And it's in my DNA, good or bad. It just doesn't sit well with me. And no one knows my position better than you, Lawrence. You wrote half my speeches and sold it. That was work. This is my life. Oh, horseshit. I have s*x with men, Mr. President. Yeah. Penetrative, a**l s*x. Oh, Jesus, Lawrence. You can't even hear the words, can you? I hear it and then I see it in my head and it just f*cks me up. Well, guess what? The closet door has swung wide open and put a ding in the driver's side of your shiny legacy that I helped write. God knows, sir, it's given me hundreds of sleepless nights. Who cares what I think anymore, huh? You fellas had a free pass to two institutions that make most men wet the bed... marriage and the military. And you morons fought to get them both. So marry each other. I don't give a rat's ass. Welcome to the sh1t, boys. Hallelujah. (mumbles) Mr. President. Mr. President. (chimes) Jonathan. Margaret. How are you? I'm well. I'm good. And Richard? All good, I hope. Richard's Richard. So, look, I wanted to ask if you would give the keynote at my annual Red Cross fundraiser next week. And I heard through the grapevine that you've been approached to run. Reclaim the compassion in conservatism. Well, nothing's been decided yet. It's just talk. If you're serious about making a go at senator, I want in. That shouldn't be a surprise to you. Well, we'll see. It's a lot. Oh, come on now. Don't go soft on me, Mags. That's not the girl I know. (sighs) You are so beautiful. Good night, Jonathan. You had a panic attack. It felt like a heart attack. Well, it wasn't, but we can run you over to Desert Regional for an EKG if you want. No, no, no, no, no. It was very stressful for you being here. It gave me the hives. Symptomatic of stress. We were a little harsh on you. Pent up, you know? 8,000 years of repression give or take a century. Lawrence, the things you wrote for me and for other politicians like me, the compromises you made, I can imagine how that feels. I understand what you have to give of yourself in order to win, get ahead. I know that now. The regret. Maggie isn't like me. Not in this issue or any other. And in all those years at the White House, she never was. So if she decides to run, she needs the best to stand right beside her. And I don't know anyone better than you. You don't have to do that, man. It's not part of the job description. Oh, no, I don't mind. Why do you do that? I used to dream of escaping this place. But whatever happened, whatever I did, wherever I go, I just... I always end up... (clicks tongue) right back here. (chuckles) Just a different perspective here, you end up exactly where you're supposed to be. You are talking to someone who followed your rise through the Scouts religiously. No, my elementary school was littered with those posters. One thing I know is that people like you. You know, I'd watch the Graves White House Christmas specials every year. Oh, my God. No, and Dan Rather's little interview with you at the end was the best part of the whole thing. And not just because you were this cute, little, smiling kid, but because you always said something funny and weirdly insightful. You know, you have this interview tomorrow... (groans) ...and from what I've seen since you're been home, really, and maybe I'm way off base, but I get the feeling that you got plenty to say. So? By the way, I was never a Scout. (scoffs) They paid me like half a mil to wear that stupid uniform and pose for the poster. The photographer got me high and introduced me to p0rn. (sighs) Make it stop. Graves, you let the bad guys get guns with that NRA bullshit. You were just a reckless cowboy. You loved me, Barney. You know it. Oh, my goodness. One gay wedding and you're hitting on Barney Frank. We live to dance another day. All right. Man :  Hey, some people trying to sleep up here! Men nonsexually hot tubbing down here. (men laugh) Shut your goddamn mouth. (men laughing) I'll be back in an hour to cook you the  petit déjeuner  of your dreams. That means breakfast. So glad we found each other, Olivia. Mi pajarito. (sighs) (knocks) Bitch is nuts, ese. Okay, just don't get rattled no matter what they ask. We've gone through all the preapproved questions, right? But if you feel unsafe, just try to steer them in a different direction. And don't forget to breathe. I got this. Here. Yeah, no. I got this. Lawrence just called. And? And he said he had a sudden change of heart and that if I did decide to run, he's on board. Well, he's a good man. (music playing) It has been such fun, Jeremy, having you here in the studio. And I bet you missed the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta being in Afghanistan, am I right? One of the many reasons I'm glad to be home. Before we let you go, let's talk about your father. Yeah, what about him? He's been a little erratic lately, don't you think? Excuse me? People just want to know what's going on, Jeremy. What's the truth? Okay. Well, let's forget for a second that you're talking about my father. What's actually going on here is that you two fake mannequin people aren't smart enough to ask an honest question without gas-lighting your audience with a bunch of sensationalistic bullshit. An audience that has literally stopped being able to discern truth from fiction. So truth? You could ask me about cancer research. You could ask me about immigration. But you didn't, did you? Because then we'd be talking about the issue. But, hey, just keep whacking that old Graves piñata that you guys have been hanging for the last 30 years, okay? Just know if you ever do it again in front of me, I'm gonna come over there and beat the f*cking truth into you.
