  Something's in the air, Bonnie, and I don't like it.

  (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) 
  I f*cked up. 
  There's no other way to say it. 
  And I don't think that I'm gonna wrap it in a bow and make it better, but... 
  I'm desperate to fix it. 
  Have you considered why you strayed? 
  (MADELINE MACKENZIE SIGHS) 
  AMANDA REISMAN: How's your husband to trust it won't happen again? 
  - Because it won't. 
  - But how can he trust that? 
  Why should he? 
  ED MACKENZIE: Thank you. 
  REISMAN: We'll turn to your betrayal in a minute. 
  My betrayal? 
  REISMAN: Adultery is one form of infidelity. 
  Indifference is another. 
  You describe yourself as a go-along, get-along, don't-make-waves kinda guy. 
  That makes you either wonderfully accommodating, or profoundly disengaged. 
  Could it be Madeline was just trying to get your attention? 
  She has always had my attention. 
  Devotion on my end has not been a problem. 
  Why were you unfaithful? 
  - MADELINE: I don't know. 
  - If you were to guess? 
  Should I guess? 
  You don't believe in you. 
  How can you trust that relational equation when you have no faith in the sum part of you? 
  Math's not my strong suit, so... 
  REISMAN: Because you didn't go to college? 
  I'm sorry? 
  You spoke earlier of your daughter not wanting to go to college. 
  Does that have something to do with her perception... 
  MADELINE: I don't see where that is relevant. 
  Did you go to college? 
  Again, I don't see the connection between what's going on... 
  REISMAN: Abigail will be nothing without college perhaps because you are? 
  MADELINE: Have you been feeding her this? 
  REISMAN: Why did your first husband leave you? 
  Because he's an asshole. 
  Tell me about your parents. 
  What was their marriage like? 
  - MADELINE: Fine. 
  - Fine? 
  - Married for years. 
  - Forty years. 
  You talk to them much? 
  (WAVES CRASH) 
  YOUNG ELIZABETH: You have to be able to hold your breath, baby. 
  YOUNG BONNIE: But I don't like it. 
  YOUNG ELIZABETH: You know what? 
  I hate getting my head wet too, but we have to be able to hold our breath underwater so if something ever happens, we don't drown, baby. 
  (POOL WATER SPLASHING) 
  YOUNG BONNIE: I don't want to. 
  (WAVES CRASH LOUDLY) 
  MADELINE: Maybe when I was three, four, I walked into my parent's bedroom, and my dad was... 
  having s*x with a woman that wasn't my mom. 
  And they were making all kinds of noises, and then I scared. 
  CELESTE WRIGHT: And what happened? 
  - He pulled me out. 
  Um... 
  - (CELESTE GROANS) 
  And closed the door, and he said, "There are things your mother doesn't ever need to know."  
  CELESTE: And you've never talked about it? 
  (WHISPERS) 
  No. 
  I guess that... 
  maybe that's why I was so devastated when Nathan left me. 
  'Cause it confirmed my biggest fear about marriage. 
  It's not to be trusted. 
  Well, I wouldn't give up on Ed. 
  - All right? 
  - I really f*cked up. 
  He's not gonna leave you. 
  Not Ed. 
  (MADELINE SIGHS) 
  How are you doing? 
  Have you had any more early morning joyrides? 
  - CELESTE: (SIGHS) 
  Funny. 
  - MADELINE: No, I'm not... being funny. 
  It actually really scared me. 
  What did Madam Shrink have to say about that? 
  She thinks it's somehow tied to me...not being sufficiently over Perry. 
  Life just feels colorless now. 
  It just feels flat and dull. 
  (SIGHS) 
  As dead as he is, sometimes I think maybe I'm deader. 
  - I was a better mother. 
  - No. 
  Honey... 
  CELESTE: I was a better mother with him. 
  I was. 
  - No! 
  Don't say that. 
  - Yes. 
  I was. 
  I need to find joy for them. 
  And he helps me with that. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  MARY LOUISE WRIGHT: Jane. 
  - Yeah? 
  - I'm Mary Louise Wright. 
  We may have met. 
  - I'm Max and Josh's grandmother. 
  - Yeah, hi. 
  I'm sorry to trouble you here at work, but, um... 
  Celeste has shared with me some... interesting news. 
  How would you feel about submitting to a paternity test? 
  I mean, submitting Ziggy to a paternity test. 
  I... 
  Yeah, I don't need to take a paternity test. 
  I know exactly who my son's father is. 
  Hmm. 
  Even so... 
  I'm not asking you for anything. 
  MARY LOUISE: No, I... 
  I realize that. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I suppose I'm asking. 
  For what? 
  Well, I'm presented with the idea that my son was both an adulterer and a... 
  (HUSHED) 
  a rapist, and I am desperate to squash that idea. 
  Well, I can tell you that he's the only man I'd been with. 
  That you recall. 
  Excuse me? 
  MARY LOUISE: Well, things happen these days. 
  Men put drugs in pretty girls' drinks, and things happen. 
  People don't remember sometimes. 
  I remember. 
  Perfectly. 
  Far more vividly than I care to. 
  - Just a simple blood test. 
  - No. 
  (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) 
  MICHAEL PERKINS: "What a tangled web we weave... 
  when first, we practice to deceive." But Charlotte didn't say that. 
  She said, "Some Pig." She didn't say anything about a tangled web. 
  PERKINS: She certainly spun one. 
  I mean, she made Wilbur out to be an outlier when in truth, he was kinda ordinary. 
  So Ziggy... 
  does that make Charlotte a liar? 
  It makes her a grownup. 
  Lying to protect someone she loves, that's what grownups do. 
  I think she was probably just rebranding Wilbur. 
  Rebranding? 
  I see. 
  Well... 
  You all want to know what I think? 
  KIDS: Mm-hmm. 
  I think Charlotte didn't want Wilbur to get eaten. 
  I don't think she wanted any pigs to be eaten, and we all know why, don't we? 
  CLASS: Sustainability. 
  Exactly. 
  Exactly. 
  How many gallons of water does it take to make a single pound of sausage? 
  - CLASS: A thousand. 
  - A thousand gallons. 
  And how many showers does that add up to? 
  - Over . 
  - Over showers. 
  So imagine, would you have to take a shower every single day - for almost two months to... 
  - (DOOR THUDS) 
  (DOOR CREAKS) 
  (AMBULANCE STAFF CHATTERING) 
  EMT: Amabella, your mother's gonna meet you at the hospital, - okay, sweetie? 
  - PERKINS: I wanna go with her. 
  EMT: Yeah, yeah. 
  We've got you covered. 
  Let me get her backpack. 
  Sarah! 
  RENATA KLEIN: What the fu... 
  What happened? 
  - Um, Mrs. 
  Klein. 
  - What... 
  I'm Amabella's mom. 
  Renata Klein. 
  What... 
  What did she do? 
  What's... 
  I'm Dr. Feldman. 
  Your daughter was brought in with an anxiety attack. 
  Anxiety attack? 
  We've given her a mild sedative, she's resting comfortably, she's not in any danger. 
  - She was in a little bit of... 
  - Can I see her? 
  ... a shock when she first came in, but... 
  - What? 
  - She's fine. 
  She's resting comfortably. 
  - Okay. 
  - Yeah. 
  Right back... 
  Right this way. 
  RENATA: What did you do? 
  Did somebody hurt you or say something or... 
  - No. 
  I'm okay, Mom. 
  - Sweetheart. 
  You were discovered in a closet practically unconscious. 
  - Was she checked for bite marks? 
  - GORDON KLEIN: Honey, come on. 
  She was bitten last year, right? 
  So... 
  Maybe somebody's bullying you again or... 
  - AMABELLA KLEIN: No... 
  - Hey baby, you okay there, my girl? 
  Don't talk to her. 
  I got this, okay? 
  I think you've done enough, don't you? 
  You... 
  What the hell are you talking about? 
  Gordon, she's obviously under immense stress. 
  You think, Renata? 
  - Team. 
  Team. 
  - Yes, hello, Doctor, I would like my daughter transferred to Stanford, please. 
  - Because? 
  - Because it's Stanford! 
  I mean, please. 
  DR. 
  FELDMAN: Well, she's being released. 
  She's cleared for discharge. 
  - GORDON: Oh, look at that. 
  - RENATA: There we go. 
  Hey... 
  Counseling is certainly indicated. 
  RENATA: Uh-huh. 
  DR. 
  FELDMAN: Perhaps for the entire family. 
  You don't know anything about my family. 
  Okay? 
  I know your own stress... 
  not helping the situation. 
  (MOCKINGLY) 
  "Your own stress..." Please. 
  Honey, isn't that great? 
  We're gonna go home. 
  - You're going home! 
  - RENATA: Don't talk to her. 
  ♪ (SOFT MUSIC PLAYS) 
  ♪ (MADDIE SIGHS) 
  Will you ever forgive me? 
  MADELINE: Yes, of course, honey. 
  It's not your fault. 
  I blurted it out. 
  The blurting is not the problem. 
  My doing it is the problem. 
  Well, you're in therapy, so that's good. 
  Right? 
  MADELINE: Yeah... 
  I mean... 
  the doctor's pretty much a crock. 
  She... 
  She thinks I feel like an empty sack because I didn't graduate from college, and that's why I'm obsessed with your going. 
  - (ABIGAIL CARLSON CHUCKLES) 
  - But that is not entirely true. 
  ABIGAIL: Mom... 
  I mean, when we would watch The Wizard of Oz, you would turn into a puddle every time The Scarecrow got his diploma. 
  (ABIGAIL CHUCKLES) 
  Well, I'm glad you're back home. 
  Otherwise, I might be totally alone. 
  He's not gonna leave you. 
  - (WHIMSICALLY) 
  Hello! 
  - RENATA: Oh! 
  We had such wonderful fun together! 
  - RENATA: Did you, honey? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Can Dr. 
  Peep have a sleepover? 
  - Oh... 
  Oh, sweetheart, I would love that, but I need to get back to my sheep. 
  I'm afraid they'd miss me. 
  Could I talk to your parents for a second in private? 
  Maybe you want to go play outside? 
  - Look at the sunset! 
  - I promise to come see you again. 
  I'll bring tea and crumpets! 
  Cool! 
  RENATA: I'll be right out. 
  We arranged all her stuffies into a petting zoo. 
  It was wonderful! 
  (GORDON SIGHS) 
  (IN REGULAR VOICE) 
  Nobody's bullying her. 
  She's worried about the end of the planet. 
  - What? 
  - Her class is evidently talking about climate change, and she's gotten the message that we're doomed. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Oh, for f*ck's sake... 
  You gotta be kidding me. 
  She's also worried about you going to jail. 
  Well, hello... 
  DR. SHEA: And she's worried about you. 
  Me? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  She thinks something is going on with you and has been for a long time. 
  So there's you, you... 
  mostly the end of the world. 
  COREY BROCKFIELD: Do you know if it's wild or farmed? 
  I believed it's farmed. 
  - COREY: Land based or net-pen? 
  - YVONNE: Sorry? 
  Were they raised on land-based facilities or in net-pens in the ocean? 
  Well, um... it's a fish, so I'm guessing the ocean. 
  COREY: Could you check? 
  - Sure... 
  - Thanks. 
  - S... 
  Sorry. 
  - (JANE CHAPMAN CHUCKLES) 
  It's okay. 
  You have to be careful with some of the farm sh1t. 
  So you just eat wild? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, mostly. 
  But there's problems there, too. 
  Some wild fish have tested positive for microplastics. 
  Some wild salmon have tested positive for antidepressants. 
  People have to ask where the fish come from, what they ate, how they lived, even how they died. 
  If they're processed post-rigor, the bacteria can leech right into the flesh... 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  - Sorry. 
  No, you don't have to apologize. 
  I used to work at Santa Monica Seafood, so I was really into all this sh1t. 
  It's great. 
  And you're teaching me a lot. 
  I'm trying to come off intelligent. 
  It's working. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  (LAUGHS) 
  MARY LOUISE: I'm... 
  I'm so sorry. 
  I'm so sorry to be such a nuisance. 
  Look, I was just... 
  I was just wondering if there are any new developments in the case. 
  We told you we would call if there were. 
  Yes. 
  Hmm... 
  I have personally worked very hard to be mindful - of your unspeakable pain. 
  - I know you care. 
  I, perhaps, do seek out those who do. 
  I know you are not allowed to say anything about the...case, or what you believe, but... 
  A mother nee... 
  A mother needs to know. 
  You don't believe my son just slipped... 
  do you? 
  You don't think it's healthy to... 
  to... 
  To cling to the good memories? 
  REISMAN: It can be. 
  I don't think so here. 
  But there are so many positives. 
  So many. 
  The way he loved me, the way he loved the boys. 
  The boys loved him. 
  I... 
  I shouldn't erase all of that simply because you feel that... 
  REISMAN: He almost killed you. 
  He didn't almost kill me. 
  REISMAN: He nearly smothered you with a cushion. 
  If one of his kicks had landed on your head, you might very well be dead. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  REISMAN: I work with and treat quite a few veterans. 
  Many want to return to combat. 
  They can't handle the mundane. 
  Normal life is dull. 
  You miss the war, Celeste. 
  (SIGHS) 
  I miss what was good. 
  I don't miss what was bad. 
  And keeping him in my heart. 
  The good... 
  The good part of him, that works for me. 
  It works for the boys. 
  It works for my family. 
  That works. 
  How did you get that bruise on your arm? 
  I broke up a fight between the boys. 
  REISMAN: Mm-hmm. 
  Last week. 
  I probably got whacked or something. 
  Do you self-inflict your bruises? 
  - CELESTE: (AGHAST) 
  What? 
  - REISMAN: It's not uncommon. 
  Victims of abuse, sometimes, they feel some... 
  attachment to their wounds. 
  Perhaps they remind you of him. 
  I do not self-inflict any wounds. 
  And your other patients do not inform on me. 
  I'm not a statistic. 
  REISMAN: Are you addict, Celeste? 
  Is Perry your drug? 
  JANE: I think it's really neat how passionate you are about things. 
  COREY: Thank you. 
  Are you passionate about things? 
  Um... 
  yeah, of course, I am. 
  You know, I... 
  I used to paint a lot. 
  I was really into art. 
  Now, I'm mostly passionate about my son. 
  I have a kid. 
  I probably should've told you that earlier, but it's kind of a weird thing to bring up. 
  He's great. 
  His name is Ziggy. 
  He's in second grade. 
  I would love to meet him. 
  JANE: Yeah, maybe one day. 
  I'm sure you guys would get along great. 
  He knows a lot of random sh1t, too. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  You guys could talk about a lot of weird facts. 
  Um... 
  COREY: I'm sorry. 
  I'm sorry. 
  No, no, it's fine. 
  It's uh... 
  Not you. 
  I just gotta idle in neutral for a little bit. 
  That's... 
  kinda my M.O. 
  right now. 
  - Neutral. 
  Okay. 
  - Yeah. 
  I can do that.

  Yeah, let me see that one. 
  Did your mom make this for you? 
  JOSH WRIGHT: We all did. 
  MARY LOUISE: (LAUGHING) 
  He sounds like a bear. 
  JOSH: He liked to combine animals. 
  - MARY LOUISE: Yeah. 
  - Oh, here's the teacup one. 
  CELESTE: How we doing here? 
  MAX WRIGHT: We're showing Grandma the memory book. 
  - It's wonderful.

  - JOSH: That one's kinda boring. 
  No, no, no. 
  Let me...

  - We loved that book. 
  - Okay... 
  PERRY WRIGHT: "He was almost too sleepy to think anymore. 
  Then he looked beyond the thorn bushes, out into the big dark night. 
  Nothing could be further than the sky. 
  'I love you right up to the moon,' he said, and closed his eyes. 
  'Oh, that's far. 
  That is very, very far.' Big Nutbrown Hare settled Little Nutbrown Hare into his bed of leaves. 
  "He leaned over and kissed him goodnight." Right on the forehead.

  (FAINTLY) 
  Yeah. 
  I just needed a... some time to wrestle with that idea but... 
  Is he sweet? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yeah. 
  He's the best. 
  MARY LOUISE: My boys were so sweet. 
  I don't think there was a gentler or more tender little boy than Perry. 
  He was so sweet and gentle. 
  Um... 
  grew up to be neither. 
  This is perhaps an unfair question... 
  On the night of your... 
  rendez-vous with my son, who initiated the encounter? 
  (STAMMERING) 
  Does that make a difference? 
  I know how devoted he was to Celeste, and I... 
  I just... can't conceive how he... 
  Unless he was tempted. 
  As men can be in a moment of weakness. 
  Did you initiate, Jane? 
  No. 
  You trying to apologize on his behalf? 
  To just... 
  justify what he did? 
  Celeste has shared with me that she and Perry had a... a complicated s*x life... 
  - one that included violence. 
  - JANE: She shared that with you? 
  Yes. 
  And I'm... 
  It makes me wonder if, perhaps, he misinterpreted or misread a signal from you. 
  Your son raped me...and as he was doing so, I was screaming for him to get off. 
  I don't think that you "misread" that. 
  I don't mean to offend you, I just... 
  It's... 
  I just can't surrender to this notion that he was... 
  evil. 
  I can't...

  Well, for as long as I need or want, I guess.

  I can't even believe in myself anymore, and, like, look at my friendships and... 
  What about your friendships? 
  MADELINE: I had no clue, Celeste. 
  I didn't even have the slightest idea that you were living through that, and it makes me feel like you couldn't even tell me. 
  - I'm sorry for keeping... 
  - Don't say sorry. 
  ... this secret... 
  But I am. 
  It's... 
  If I was in your situation, I probably... 
  Probably what? 
  Would have done the same things as me? 
  Hmm? 
  - No, Madeline, you wouldn't. 
  - I don't know. 
  You would have been out of that marriage so fast. 
  I wish. 
  I wish I had told you. 
  I do. 
  You would have jumped into that pool, pulled me out. 
  RENATA: What possesses two idiots like yourselves to teach eight-year-olds that the planet is doomed? 
  The children are constantly bombarded with climate change. 
  It is all over the news. 
  It's our job to deconstruct it so that they can process it. 
  Good for you. 
  You deconstructed my little girl into a coma. 
  Renata, look. 
  We scheduled an assembly for this evening. 
  Okay? 
  You are not the only parent complaining. 
  Just, by far, the loudest. 
  You're pitiful. 
  Okay, this is gonna come as a shock to you. 
  This school is actually here to serve all the children, not just Amabella. 
  You think 'cause of this whole bankruptcy thing... 
  that the school thinks I don't matter? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Please. 
  I will be rich again. 
  I will rise up. 
  I will buy a f*cking polar bear for every kid in this school. 
  And then, I will squish you like the bug that you are. 
  Pretends like he's not a smoker. 
  Hasn't been laid in f*cking years. 
  Don't you talk to me like that! 
  And you, I can't be bothered to squish you. 
  WARREN NIPPAL: You're a model citizen, Renata. 
  - (DOOR SLAMS) 
  - I told you, these second-grade mothers, they are Shakespearean. 
  (DESK CLATTERS) 
  That woman, she's the f*cking Medusa of Monterey. 
  And yes, I smoke. 
  Do you want one of these? 
  - Yes, please. 
  - Yeah, I got a spot outside where the kids can't f*cking see us. 
  RENATA: f*ck them. 
  Oh, my God, I am so livid. 
  - Okay, let's... 
  - I am so livid. 
  Let's go get a coffee or something. 
  RENATA: Please. 
  The teacher was in on it. 
  He really said, "Go to hell?" - Yeah, he's a sh1t. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  They practically kill my daughter, and then he's just dismissing me like that? 
  What a pus-fuck. 
  - And then... 
  - Oh. 
  Mary Louise. 
  D-Did you find a place? 
  MARY LOUISE: Maybe. 
  Just saw one. 
  MADELINE: Good, good, good. 
  You know Renata Klein? 
  - We do... 
  - I don't believe I do. 
  We... 
  We did meet. 
  At the funeral. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  - I was a friend of Perry's. 
  - You were there. 
  When he fell. 
  I was. 
  That was, uh... 
  devastating. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  So sorry to interrupt. 
  - I... 
  - Come on. 
  Let's get out of here. 
  - What... 
  What... 
  What the f*ck is that? 
  - I don't know. 
  She's very strange. 
  JANE: Whoo! 
  - COREY: Whoo! 
  - BONNIE: Jane. 
  - Hey. 
  - JANE: Hi! 
  Oh, my God!

  - BONNIE: I'm good. 
  How are you? 
  - I'm good. 
  Oh, my gosh, that's so funny. 
  Ziggy's learning to surf. 
  Corey's teaching him. 
  BONNIE: This is getting kinda serious, huh? 
  JANE: No, no... 
  Told Ziggy about him and told him that he was teaching me to surf, so of course, he wanted to learn. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  He did try to kiss me the other night, though. 
  - And? 
  - It was... 
  extremely awkward. 
  I don't know. 
  My body just shut down. 
  BONNIE: Does he know about your history? 
  JANE: Mm-mm. 
  Not yet. 
  BONNIE: You should talk to him. 
  I don't know if I'm ready for that. 
  Look, any real relationship you're gonna have, if you wanna have one...he's gotta know who you are, right? 
  Yeah. 
  I guess that's true. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - What? 
  I'm such a hypocrite. 
  - Nathan has no idea who I am.

  NIPPAL: First off, thank you all for coming to a special evening assembly at our wonderful, wonderful Otter Bay, and a special thanks to those parents who took special time out of their busy lives to reach out to me directly about this important issue, - so thank you. 
  - RENATA: You're welcome. 
  Yeah. 
  Now, as we all know, anxiety is an epidemic - in our schools. 
  - (ANGRY CHATTER) 
  Really? 
  It wouldn't be if you weren't teaching them... 
  All right, let's take a breath, everybody, and let's try and keep this constructive, shall we? 
  Climate change and the toll that it takes on our students, it is a complicated matter, okay? 
  That is why we called this ad hoc Golden Bell Award-winning assembly: because not only will you hear from me, we would love to hear from you. 
  The parents. 
  - (PARENTS CLAMOR) 
  - Okay, hold up. 
  We've already told you how we feel about it. 
  This is not how I want this to go. 
  - Everybody, please sit down... 
  - (CLAMOR CONTINUES) 
  Shut up! 
  MADELINE: Really? 
  Are you seriously telling us to shut up? 
  Madeline Mackenzie. 
  Lovely. 
  Okay, since you've taken this opportunity to speak up, let us first hear from you. 
  Would you like to come up here please, Madeline? 
  Why... 
  Why me? 
  Because you're a beacon among us, Madeline. 
  - Now, please, come up here. 
  - Fine. 
  No, no, I'm fine. 
  - NIPPAL: Thank you. 
  - RENATA: And make sure they know - my daughter was in a coma. 
  - Okay. 
  Okay, yeah. 
  NIPPAL: Madeline Mackenzie, everyone. 
  Please. 
  (APPLAUSE) 
  Just share your thoughts. 
  I mean, where do we even begin? 
  Honestly? 
  About everything? 
  I mean, Principal Nippal, you have a very good point. 
  Climate change is important. 
  It's important. 
  But it's also a lot to load up on a lot of second graders. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - Yes. 
  MADELINE: That the whole world might go kapooey. 
  They need to know that? 
  You know, I think part of the problem is... 
  we lie to our kids. 
  We fill their heads full of Santa Claus and stories with happy endings, when most of us know most endings to most stories f*cking suck. 
  Right? 
  Let's just get real. 
  There aren't a lot of happy endings for a lot of people, you know. 
  Be it climate change, be it guns in schools. 
  And our kids are afraid. 
  They're afraid to go to school. 
  They're afraid they're gonna get shot. 
  We don't prepare them. 
  We fill their heads full of happy endings and happy stories and lies. 
  And... 
  And we tell them things like, "You're fine." You're gonna be fine," and we tell ourselves... 
  We tell ourselves we're gonna be fine. 
  But we're not. 
  You know that song that we used to sing when we were little, "The Rainbow Connection"? 
  There's a line in it, they talk about rainbows are illusions. 
  And then... 
  there's another line, and it goes on, and it says that, that... 
  "Who said every wish would be granted... would be... 
  if you wish on a morning star." Do you remember that? 
  But this is the part that I thought... 
  Is that "Somebody thought of that..."  
  (VOICE BREAKING) 
  Then someone believed them. 
  "And look what it's done..."  
  (SOBBING) 
  We have to tell the children that... 
  that... 
  Life is an illusion and things don't work out sometimes, and that... 
  and... 
  you can't tell them part of the truth. 
  You have to tell them the whole truth.

  (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) 
  CELESTE: She's not picking up. 
  (SIGHS) 
  RENATA: Um, is this a full blown breakdown or something? 
  I mean... 
  CELESTE: Too much to get up there and help her, Ed? 
  Hmm? 
  She's your f*cking wife. 
  ED: Well, thanks for the tip, Celeste. 
  Maybe we could get coffee, you and me, and you could fill me in on whatever else I've missed. 
  You don't think he knows about... 
  No.

  Can you get me some wine?

  - CELESTE: What are you doing? 
  - Oh, sweet Jesus! 
  You gave me such a fright. 
  Well... 
  Okay, I won't lie.

  You're snooping. 
  You have quite an impressive array. 
  I think it's probably best if you find another place. 
  Celeste, I am on your side. 
  CELESTE: (SIGHS) 
  So you keep saying. 
  Hmm. 
  Vicodin. 
  You have to be so careful of these opioids, dear. 
  Sometimes I needed it.
