 MADELEINE MACKENZIE: This is Jane Chapman. She's new here.

 An autopsy is still being conducted to ascertain the exact cause of death.    
 The injuries were many, and they were severe.    
 We're talking multiple broken bones.    
 There's clearly a lot of bad blood in this community.    
 Someone hurt Amabella.    
 This could get ugly.    
 Ticking bomb. I'll leave it at that.    
 You're dead in this town.

 No, I know that I'll never be over it.    
 Something had to be wrong.    
 We have this... dirty secret.

 It's human nature. They grow out of it.

 We have to earn our good-mom badges all over again.     
 "Has she gotten fatter over the summer?     
 Does she look older?" 
These questions get asked, Ed, and we all get judged all over again.     
 It's a complete double standard 'cause if a dad shows up, they're like, "Wow, there's a dad here.     
 He's involved." But with the moms...

 Really pushing the school spirit this year, aren't you?     
 Well, it's my otter blood, Madeline.     
 - Hi, Madeline Martha Mackenzie. 
- Lisa Coolidge.     
 Anyway, it was a beautiful service, Warren.     
 WARREN NIPPAL: (LAUGHS) Well, thank you, Madeline, I like to think of it more as an assembly.     
 A service is for when someone dies, you know, like a school fundraiser.     
 You're not seriously gonna go there, are you?     
 My hope is that you don't go there, Madeline.     
 Now, let's remember a lot of last year's mishigas were lovingly stirred up by you.     
 MELISSA: Anybody want a red velvet?     
 - Melissa! 
- Cupcake?     
 MADELINE: I'll take one for each thigh.

- I don't even like to chew.     
 I just shove 'em down.     
 Maybe you can give one to Warren so he can shove it too.     
 WARREN: (CHUCKLES) And we're off.     
 - MADELINE: Bonnie. 
- It's a classy crop of moms, these ones.     
 Those gluten-free?     
 MADELINE: Tahoe was good?     
 Uh, yeah, it was good. 
Nathan caught a lot of fish.     
 - Wow. 
- And I hear you're selling     
 houses like crazy. That's very cool.     
 Oh my gosh, in Monterey, it is like printing money.     
 I should have done this years ago.     
 - I'm gonna go find Skye. 
- Okay.     
 Okay. Are you two fighting?     
 Uh, no. Actually, I almost wish we were.     
 No, she's... she's been acting like that for a while now.     
 Acting like what?     
 Shut down. Like, withdrawn.     
 Oh, you mean you're not having s*x.     
 Okay, don't forget that Abigail has her college counselor     
 - meeting at  :   p.m. 
- Yeah, yeah, I got your...     
 I got your emails. 
Six of them this morning.     
 - Good. Thank you. 
- This is her future, Nathan.     
 Nice to be back.     
 I'm told that my daughter, Amabella, is going to be in your class. So exciting.     
 Yes, very nice to meet you.     
 Um, she has an IQ of    . Genius level, right.     
 That's a very high number. 
Life's about give and take.     
 I expect you to take care of my daughter.     
 Pay special attention. 
And, again, welcome.     
 Um, oh, oh, oh. (CHUCKLES) And... my Amabella was bullied last year.     
 I mean, in like, biting and choking.     
 So, we're gonna make sure that doesn't happen again.     
 - (BAND PLAYS) 
- RENATA KLEIN: Oh.     
 Oops. Sorry.     
 Sorry.     
 Here's my problem with the whole meditation thing.     
 It's like you shut out the world, but you also shut out your friends, which is a little bit weird.     
 And also, does she look funny? 
Something's not right.     
 - Are you talking about Bonnie? 
- Uh-huh.     
 Like, she's off. But she was off before she went to Tahoe.     
 Unplugged is one thing, but unhinged is a total other thing.     
 - (HORN BLARES) 
- Hey! Asshole! Hey!     
 - Oh, hon. 
- Why are you cutting me off?     
 - Honey. The horn. The horn. 
- Dick! I just think we...     
 Oh, yeah, sorry.     
 Once I lean in, you know how I am.     
 - CELESTE: Indeed. 
- I think we need to talk to her and see where her head is at.     
 - CELESTE: Do you? 
- Do you want to get a coffee?     
 By the way, did you see Renata getting up that new teacher's ass?     
 I thought she was gonna have to pull out her snorkel.     
 CELESTE: Easy. I'm gonna go to the ladies' room,     
 - can you get me an Americano? 
- MADELINE: Will do.     
 - Hey, Bruna. 
- BRUNA: Hey, Madeline.     
 MADELINE: Wow, do you sell weed? 
It smells like weed over here.     
 - Keep the change. 
- BRUNA: Thank you so much.     
 - Can I get an Americano 
- (DISTANT CHATTER) and a bran muffin?     
 - ... that's a thing? 
- MADELINE: Mary Louise?     
 - Hi. I'm Madeline. 
- MARY LOUISE: Hi.     
 - Madeline! So nice to 
- Yes.     
 - see you again. 
- I'm Celeste's friend. Yes.     
 How have you been?     
 Good, good. The kids are good.     
 - How are you? 
- I can't complain.     
 Actually, I can.     
 My son is dead.     
 But Celeste tells me that you continue to be so helpful with her and the boys and...     
 She should just get a proper housekeeper.     
 - You're very short. 
- (SCOFFS) Excuse me?     
 I don't mean it in a negative way.     
 MADELINE: Oh. (CHUCKLES)     
 Maybe I do.     
 I find little people to be untrustworthy.     
 (CHUCKLES) My apologies. 
It's just that I'm...     
 I pride myself on being a very good judge of character, but you have always presented such a difficult read.     
 You know, you seem like a nice person.     
 Loving. But also, you strike me as a wanter.     
 - A... A wanter? 
- Mm.     
 You know... there are people in... in life who content themselves with what they have, and then there are others who just... just want.     
 I'm not a wanter.     
 Oh, you don't have to take it personally.     
 Anyway, I'm a wanter myself.     
 You know what I want? I want Perry back.     
 I wanna know what happened that night.     
 And I... I'm very tempted to ask you, but I doubt I would get the, uh... the truth, would I?     
 Your son lost his balance and he fell.     
 Yes, that seems to be the company line.     
 Depending on whose company you keep.     
 Mary Louise.     
 Madeline and I were just... talking.     
 MADELINE: What the hell was that?     
 That was a very strong position.     
 And I didn't like it!     
 Welcome to my life.     
 - (CARTS CRASH) 
- Sorry.     
 Whoa. Hi!     
 Tori.     
 Sorry, I didn't recognize you at first.     
 Yeah, I had my breasts done.     
 Oh.     
 Yeah, it's fabulous.     
 I always felt a little self-conscious, you know.     
 About your breasts?     
 - My nose. 
- Oh.     
 Now, nobody notices it so much.     
 Everybody notices these though. 
And that pisses Joseph off.     
 So... uh...     
 Well, I'll see you around.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 (MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON LOUDSPEAKER)     
 DR. AMANDA REISMAN: How long does she plan to stay?     
 Well, she comes and goes.     
 It's a short hop from San Francisco.     
 She's been...     
 - a really big help. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 I mean, I'd be lost without her.     
 So what brings you?     
 It's been a while.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 (SIGHS)     
 I've had some nightmares starting up of late that, um...     
 I mean, may be triggered by the beginning of the school year.     
 I think I still...     
 - associate that place with... 
- How could you not?     
 Last night was...     
 It was a beauty.     
 Perry and I were in... the in-vitro facility, and... it was all so sweet, and... and suddenly, I...     
 I turned into a monster.     
 I was strangling him. I was lifting him up, and I...     
 I... (SIGHS)     
 It was... beyond disturbing, and I... I... a little exhilarating.     
 Hmm...     
 Is that... Do you see yourself as a monster?     
 I guess I still feel...     
 - responsible. 
- For...?     
 For the accident.     
 I mean, if I'd left him when I should have...     
 We should have never been together that night, and he might still be alive.     
 That I chose that night of all nights to leave him and to tell him and...     
 Even in death, his message lives on.     
 - What message? 
- That you're to blame.     
 You're always to blame.     
 You're not.     
 - Are you getting out? 
- (SCOFFS)     
 - Are you seeing anyone? 
- No.     
 That part of me is still dead, I suppose.     
 First thing's first: get the boys' lives back on track, that's the priority.     
 Seeing their mom happy could help there.     
 So, you're saying for my life to go on successfully,     
 - I need to be with a man? 
- No.     
 But the freedom to be with one, maybe.     
 You're still married, Celeste, and the husband is dead.

 NATHAN CARLSON: Where've you been?     
 I told you I was running.     
 That was like two hours ago, I've been calling you.     
 BONNIE: Sorry.     
 Honey.     
 I just thought it might be that you hated Tahoe, but since we've been back...     
 Come on.     
 BONNIE: I need some space, Nathan. I told you.     
 Just let it be.     
 JANE CHAPMAN: He's my favorite in the whole aquarium.     
 It's a red octopus, and watch.     
 The closer he gets to the kelp, he'll change his color so that he camouflages with his environment.     
 - CHILD: Cool. 
- Look. You see him right now?     
 - CHILD: Yeah. 
- He's changing color.     
 You guys want to know a fun fact about octopus?     
 - ALL: Yeah! 
- It's kinda weird.     
 - You can handle it? 
- Yeah.     
 Okay, females contain deadly venom, and sometimes, they'll kill and they'll eat the males     
 - after they mate with them. 
- CHILDREN: (GROAN) Ew!     
 JANE: (CHUCKLES) I know.     
 SARAH: Why is it the prettier something is, the more dangerous? Like with snakes and spiders.     
 That's a great question. 
I wish I knew the answer to that.     
 - COREY BROCKFIELD: One second, okay? 
- You're so observant.     
 Sometimes, pretty colors are to give a fair warning so other animals know they need to keep a safe distance.     
 GIRL: Oh.     
 There you go.     
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER)     
 NATHAN: How you doing?     
 Good. You?     
 Not really, no. Bonnie.     
 I mean, she's gone missing in mental action.     
 The whole summer, truth be told.     
 Hey, man, could I...     
 Could I ask you a big favor?     
 Could you maybe take her out to lunch?     
 - Um... 
- Listen, you've always been better to talking to women than I have and, you know, you certainly got Madeline in a way I never could.     
 I mean, I think you might be able to get her to open up.     
 You know, you have your little way.     
 All I'm getting is pushback at every turn.     
 I swear to God, if I signed up for this bullshit, I'd still be with Maddie.     
 - I mean... I don't mean... 
- Oh, no, no.     
 Um, look, Nathan...     
 I'm no expert on marriage or anything.     
 I mean, something tells me if you're seeking out the husband of your ex-wife to, like, lead the communication charge with your new one...     
 Why do you always have to be so snide?     
 - I don't mean to be snide. 
- No, you don't mean to be, it just comes natural. It's like you're a snide f*ck.     
 That's what you are. 
You're a snide f*ck.     
 You know, Nathan, maybe instead of just talking to Bonnie, you should embrace some of her interests.     
 - Her interests? 
- Yeah.     
 She won't even let me embrace her.     
 - Okay. 
- Yeah, you're snide.     
 - You're a snide f*ck. 
- What?     
 - Whatever. 
- Come on.

 I don't want to go to college.

 It feels so good to say that out loud. (SIGHS)     
 Okay, Abigail, honey. 
You're going to college.     
 The planet is dying, Mom, but God forbid I don't study Lysistrata?     
 It's bullshit.     
 Do you know what kids do at college?     
 They drink. They f*ck. 
They mull over a s*x change.     
 - I'm not going. 
- All right,     
 - you're going to college. 
- I'm not going.     
 - I'm not going to college. 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.     
 If you wanna go, you know, you should go.     
 - You should go to college. 
- Hey, no,     
 I know how to make any situation about me.     
 This is not that. This is about you     
 - and your future, Abigail. 
- NATHAN: Abby.     
 - ABIGAIL CARLSON: I'm not going. 
- I'm so sorry.     
 Where did she go?     
 I...     
 - Did you know about this? 
- No, I swear.     
 You were with her all summer in Tahoe,     
 - and you knew nothing about this? 
- Madeline,     
 - I didn't know. 
- And what about Bonnie?     
 Did she know about this "f*ck college" plan?     
 Bonnie's left the building.     
 Unbelievable.     
 You know if she doesn't go to college, she won't have a life.     
 She'll just be serving Big Macs and French fries, and that'll be her life.     
 - Is that what you want for her, Nathan? 
- Stop, stop. Stop yelling at me.     
 - Stop yelling at me. 
- What? You know you bear     
 - some responsibility here, right? 
- NATHAN: I do?     
 - You're her father. 
- Oh, okay.     
 This is her senior year, she's on the cusp of her life, and you let it go all to sh1t

 But honestly, Ed, if she doesn't go to college, what's she gonna do? Go into retail?     
 Oh, let me call you right back.     
 Mary Louise?     
 - Hey, Maddie. 
- Oh, Madeline. Hello.     
 What's going on?     
 Well, I thought I might look for a small flat here in town, so that I could help out with the boys but not quite be so underfoot.     
 (CLEARS THROAT)     
 
 
 
 - MADELINE: Oh, I see. 
- Do you work here?     
 - Yes. 
- Do you handle rentals?     
 I do, actually. Oren and I both do, yes.     
 I see you're wearing heels.     
 Yes.     
 Um, Oren, do you mind if I just have a minute with Mrs. Wright?     
 Of course not. 
You're in wonderful hands.     
 MADELINE: Thank you.     
 Mary Louise, I realize that you're still grieving, and that you've been through a tremendous amount of heartbreak, but I don't care for the way you spoke to me before.     
 It was rude, and I didn't deserve it.     
 No, you didn't. Um, I apologize.     
 Well, thank you.     
 MARY LOUISE: The truth is, it had nothing to do with you.     
 When I was in boarding school, I had... I had a best friend, or so I thought, who revealed herself to be quite treacherous, and, uh, caused me a lot of pain.     
 So... she was just an itty-bitty little thing with a big, bubbly personality that, um... was designed to hide... that she was utterly vapid inside.     
 You remind me so much of her that I suppose I punish you for that.     
 That's wrong of me, and I apologize.     
 - Oren. 
- OREN: Yes. Sorry.     
 I'm sure Oren will address all of your concerns.

 So why is not for you?     
 Well...     
 Starting with the cost. 
It's really expensive.     
 So, I'm assuming that if you're gonna abandon that plan to go to college, you have another plan...     
 I do.     
 What is it?     
 - It's to work for a startup. 
- Oh, my God.     
 Specifically, one that builds for-profit housing for the homeless.     
 - Excuse me?

 ABIGAIL: I'm not doing that!     
 Well, then, what are you doing?     
 There are four million homeless people in America, the average age being nine years old,     
 - and I... 
- I don't give a f*ck!     
 I don't care about f*cking homeless people.     
 What?     
 That is not what I meant.     
 I do care about homeless people.     
 I just think you can give money to some charity while you actually attend college.     
 - I'm not going to college. 
- Yes, you are.     
 - Give me one good reason what I should. 
- It's non-negotiable.     
 You are going to college because I said so, and because you're not thinking straight...     
 Because you said so?     
 - Yes, because I said so. 
- What do you know?     
 You didn't go to college.

 Exactly.
