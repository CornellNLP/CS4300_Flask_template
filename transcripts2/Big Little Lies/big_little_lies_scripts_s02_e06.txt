 People file for bankruptcy all the time. 
  You really don't get to settle anything anymore, Mr. 
  Klein. 
  That all falls on me. 
  We're not moving in a circle. 
  We're exploring the space. 
  You could trust me to love you. 
  If I f*ck up again, it will not be with infidelity. 
  I was protecting you Best way I could, by keeping the peace. 
  Kill me. 
  We need to do what's best for the boys. 
  There are so many possibilities should this go to court, Celeste, a lot of them bad. 
  I'm gonna have to testify, and that means that I'm fair game. 
  No! 
  I pushed him. 
  - No, wait! 
  Wait! 
  - I did it. 
  I did it. 
  You did not push him. 
  And you did not push him. 
  No one did this. 
  Nobody. 
  Call an ambulance! 
  What the f*ck! 
  You're a cop? 
  No, I'm not a cop. 
  Well, what the f*ck were you doing there? 
  - I I was - Bonnie saw you. 
  Do you want to come in? 
  I can explain. 
  Yeah, you better f*cking explain. 
  Okay, um I I was called in for questioning. 
  More like ordered. 
  By who? 
  - Um Detective Quinlan. 
  - What did she say? 
  She asked me about us and you and she asked whether you had talked to me about Perry Wright's death. 
  - What did you tell her? 
  - I told her the truth, that you didn't tell me anything. 
  But Jane, she knows your history with this guy. 
  She knows he raped you, she knows he's Ziggy's dad, and she clearly doesn't think he slipped. 
  She said with five witnesses, the odds are in her favor one of you will finally crack. 
  The first one who does gets a break. 
  The other four are f*cked. 
  He went to, uh to kick me again and and I think that's when he He must have taken a step back and and he fell. 
  I don't really remember because he stumbled back. 
  And that must have been when he fell. 
  Is there anything else that you would like to add? 
  I feel, um I just feel like I don't have a proper memory of everything, so that's why it's a little inconsistent. 
  But we're not gonna break. 
  Right? 
  - No. 
  Right. 
  - Yeah. 
  Okay, we're gonna keep our poise and we're gonna stay calm Jesus Christ, a meteor could hit and you would say, "Stay calm. 
  " Oh, f*ck off, Bonnie. 
  You know what? 
  I'm so tired of taking care of you - and your f*cking feelings. 
  - Oh my god I know your mom had a stroke, but let's not forget, you're the one who pushed him. 
  - What the f*ck you say to me? 
 ! 
  - Whoa, who, whoa! 
  - He slipped. 
  - Oh, my god. 
  - No one f*cking pushed anybody. 
  - All right, all right. 
  - He slipped. 
  - Come on. 
  Bonnie. 
  - He slipped, right? 
  Right? 
  - He slipped. 
  Right. 
  Right. 
  Yeah. 
  All right, - let's go, baby. 
  Come on. 
  - It's all right. 
  Jesus. 
  And so I started to run at him. 
  And the closer I got to him the more I knew what I had to do. 
  You're still here, huh? 
  Yeah, I, um, left and came back. 
  Doctor's gonna be here shortly with an update. 
  You ready? 
  'Cause I'm not. 
  She's too damn young, for God's sake. 
  You're gonna fight this. 
  You hear me, baby? 
  You're gonna fight this. 
  What did you say? 
  Something in the vein of "f*ck off. 
  " I know it was rude. 
  I feel bad. 
  I just Why were you all out there? 
  This secret last-minute meeting. 
  Were you helping Celeste prepare for her custody battle? 
  Um, no, we were just being there for her, you know. 
  - And at night? 
  - Solidarity. 
  Yeah. 
  And during all this solidarity, is that when "f*ck off" came up, or Mm-hmm. 
  You know, the other day, when you talked about hating yourself, there was honesty. 
  I mean It gave me hope. 
  First time in a long time, the air felt clear. 
  But right now, it seems like the window is fogging up, like you're hiding again. 
  I never knew the meaning of true love - Mom? 
  - Hey. 
  It's cold. 
  Come here. 
  - You couldn't sleep? 
  - No. 
  He knows that I am lying about something. 
  We made a pact. 
  He's my husband. 
  It's f*cking pact, Madeline. 
  You don't tell anybody that! 
  I mean, you're the one that says Ed's all about truth and honesty. 
  - He is. 
  - Oh, great. 
  So, suppose he leads with that? 
  Are you kidding me? 
  Then, we're f*cked, and Celeste is f*cked first. 
  She'll lose her kids. 
  You cannot tell him that. 
  Yeah Hey, Kristen. 
  Uh, we have a seafood watch question. 
  The mom with the penguin kid with the penguin hat. 
  You got it. 
  Yeah. 
  So, you're not gonna return my phone calls or my texts 'cause I talked to the police? 
  No, it has nothing to do with the police. 
  I just can't do this right now. 
  Hey, who wants to touch something, uh, prickly. 
  - Me! 
  - Okay. 
  She she's just to my left. 
  I'm just kidding. 
  No, I'm kidding. 
  We have slimy kelp here. 
  I just want you to know how sorry I am that it's come to this. 
  But at the end of the day, we are still family, you know? 
  We're not family, Mary Louise. 
  All rise. 
  - Be seated. 
  - Okay. 
  I have before me the psychiatric reports, together with the finding of the child psychologist. 
  I am not satisfied. 
  As I stated at the outset, the court takes these matters seriously. 
  As both a judge and a mother, I'm ill-inclined to remove these children from the only home they've ever known. 
  That said, I do have concerns. 
  Both parties will be provided copies of the reports today, which I would like to enter into evidence by joint stipulation. 
  Given the underlying neutrality of these recommendations, I anticipate no objection. 
  All right. 
  We will proceed with the evidentiary hearing tomorrow. 
  Mrs. 
  Wright? 
  I wish to first hear from you. 
  You will take the stand and entertain questions from me as well as the petitioner's counsel. 
  Your Honor, I'd like to conduct a direct first. 
  Not necessary. 
  You can redirect after, should you feel the need. 
  Okay? 
  See you all back here tomorrow. 
  Hey. 
  No, come on. 
  We expected this. 
  Come on. 
  Come on. 
  Are the boys gonna have to be here? 
  Not for tomorrow, no. 
  Celeste. 
  There is the risk she could get full custody. 
  I'm not settling. 
  - I am not settling. 
  - Okay. 
  And don't try to handle me here. 
  - All right? 
  Don't do that. 
  - Handle, no. 
  Advise, yes. 
  Farber's goal will be to make you look erratic. 
  I can protect you some, you just can't look like you need protection. 
  Do you understand what I'm telling you? 
  Yeah, of course. 
  I'm on my own. 
  - That's what you're saying. 
  - You are not on your own. 
  But we need to be careful. 
  Get some rest. 
  There's nothing more we can do. 
  I'm afraid we just have to watch and wait. 
  Do you have any questions? 
  - Can we kill her? 
  - Bonnie. 
  She doesn't want to exist like this. 
  We can't kill her. 
  I know it's done. 
  Pain management, we give her - morphine. 
  - That isn't the kind of pain we manage. 
  Morphine is not indicated here. 
  You'd do it for a dog. 
  - Bonnie. 
  - What? 
  Enough. 
  Oh, it's a total nightmare. 
  What, the hearing is open to the public? 
  No, Judge Marilyn Cipriani. 
  I wish I knew somebody who knew somebody who knew her. 
  I, uh, said goodbye to Amabella. 
  Oh, Juliette I kinda told her that I might be coming back, you know, to soften the goodbye. 
  That was such a good idea. 
  I know, it's Um, my my lawyer said I need to talk to you - about the severance again. 
  - Oh, honey, I know We know we owe it. 
  But now, it's It's in bankruptcy trustee's hands. 
  So, first things first, we need to find you a new job. 
  Right, you you got our letter of recommendation? 
  - Yeah, I did. 
  Thank you. 
  - Yep, sure. 
  Of course. 
  So, I guess this is goodbye. 
  Uh-huh. 
  Let's not. 
  No, it's not goodbye here. 
  Because we will rise up, and when we do, we will hire you back. 
  - Okay. 
  Okay. 
  - Okay? 
  Oh, I couldn't have done this without you, Juliette. 
  Whoo! 
  Yeah, baby! 
  Whoo! 
  Good job, buddy. 
  - Good job, high five. 
  Whoo! 
  - Oh, my god! 
  That was so cool. 
  I love that. 
  Hey! 
  What are you not doing in school? 
  You're not suspended again, I hope. 
  No, it's a parent-teacher conference. 
  Oh, cool. 
  Well, you I saw you catch that wave. 
  Looks like you got it down. 
  You don't need my help, huh? 
  No, I still need your help. 
  I'm not that good. 
  She's been teaching me! 
  Again. 
  - Both of you guys are so good at this. 
  - Hey, baby. 
  Uh, do you wanna just build a sandcastle for a minute? 
  - Give us a second to talk? 
  - Okay. 
  - Thank you. 
  - You guys wanna talk private. 
  Yeah, we do. 
  Will you take a board, too? 
  - All right. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Make sure you got a moat - Hey, over here. 
  - To keep the people out. 
  - Your toys are over here. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hey. 
  So, you're gonna freeze me out forever? 
  It's gonna take me a long time to let someone in again. 
  I'm not walking away. 
  Mom, check this out. 
  - Bonnie, I - Metal in the pocket. 
  Look, I I wanna apologize for the other day. 
  I was completely out of line. 
  It's fine. 
  We're going through a lot of stuff, you know. 
  No, everything your mom is going through, I had no right to speak to you like that. 
  And I want you to know if I can be helpful, which I I don't know how I could, but I want to be. 
  Thank you. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah, I'm good. 
  Like what you said, everyone's going through stuff, and I - I'm no exception. 
  - It's getting to you, isn't it? 
  What? 
  It's getting to you. 
  Every. 
  Time. 
  Every time. 
  I know how you feel. 
  It's like that put us on a list. 
  Please raise your right hand. 
  Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but truth, so help you God? 
  - I do. 
  - Please be seated. 
  - Mr. 
  Farber. 
  - Thank you, Your Honor. 
  The whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
  Do you have any questions concerning the oath you just took, Mrs. 
  Wright? 
  - None. 
  - Excellent. 
  And first off, my sympathies. 
  Your husband died. 
  And now this. 
  That can't be easy. 
  In fact, it's not been easy for a long time, has it, Mrs. 
  Wright? 
  You were in an abusive relationship with your husband. 
  - Yes. 
  - Physically abusive. 
  - Yes. 
  - Emotionally abusive. 
  - Yes. 
  - He hit you. 
  - Many times. 
  - Did you ever hit him? 
  I mean, sometimes, I would fight back. 
  Did you ever hit him first? 
  It happened, but I mean, more typically, he attacked me. 
  That must have been terrifying. 
  Was it ever thrilling? 
  Thrilling? 
  Did the physical violence ever lead to s*x? 
  - Objection. 
  - Uh, overruled. 
  Did the physical violence ever occasion you and your late husband to have s*x? 
  - Yes. 
  - Great s*x? 
  You were aroused by the violence. 
  I was not aroused by the violence. 
  You never said that? 
  That the incendiary exchanges with your husband, including the physical violence led to gratifying and passionate s*x, did you ever say that? 
  My relationship with my husband was very complicated. 
  Complicated. 
  Was it sick? 
  - It was not healthy. 
  - Are you over your sickness? 
  - Objection. 
  - Sustained. 
  Did you miss the violence? 
  No, I do not. 
  I I miss my husband but I don't miss getting beat up. 
  So So, he beat you up often? 
  He did. 
  Did you ever call the police? 
  - No. 
  - Never? 
  Did you ever tell anybody? 
  - No. 
  - You never told anybody that your husband was hurting you? 
  I told my therapist. 
  Are you healed now? 
  - Objection. 
  - Sustained. 
  Do you, uh, recognize this man? 
  - Yes. 
  - What's his name? 
  - I don't know. 
  - Oh, not even a first name? 
  Um Jeff. 
  Uh, Joe. 
  Joe. 
  It was Joe. 
  I I think. 
  Did you have sexual relationships with Joe? 
  Uh Um, I did I'd had a bit to drink. 
  So, approximately how long after you met Joe - did the two of you have s*x? 
  - Objection. 
  Well, not long enough to get his name. 
  - Objection. 
  - Counsel. 
  Did this also get violent? 
  It was physical. 
  And are you really over your sickness? 
  - Objection. 
  - Sustained. 
  Do you recognize this man? 
  Michael something. 
  Did you have s*x with Michael something? 
  My social life is not I mean, this is Did you have s*x with Michael something? 
  Yes. 
  And it also got physical? 
  Um If anything, I was the aggressor. 
  Oh, so where did this aggressive s*x take place? 
  In a bathroom. 
  - A bathroom stall? 
  - Yes. 
  - A public bathroom stall? 
  - Yes. 
  How long after you met Michael something did you have aggressive s*x in a public bathroom stall? 
  - Objection. 
  - Sustained. 
  In the interest of time, just And No, this Please. 
  Did you have sexual relations with all these men? 
  Listen, this this has nothing to do with my capacity to parent my children. 
  This Did you children ever meet any of these men, these sexual one-offs, your boys ever meet 'em? 
  - They They met Joe. 
  - No others? 
  Um, no. 
  Did you ever bring any of these men home when the boys were there? 
  No. 
  Um Well, once. 
  Once, I did, but, um He was gone. 
  He was gone before they woke up, so Oh, so if Josh were to tell his grandmother, "The other night, I tried to get into bed with Mommy, but there was a stranger there," he'd be lying? 
  If he said, "I tried to wake Mommy up, but I couldn't, and the stranger told me to go back to my room," that would just be his imagination? 
  Uh I mean sometimes I, um, have trouble sleeping, and so I take Ambien, and that Have you ever driven while on Ambien and run off the side of a road? 
  Um Your Honor, um - Your Honor. 
  - Answer to me, please. 
  - Answer to me. 
  - No, I would - I would like to address the court. 
  - Go ahead. 
  Um, I have I drove off the road once. 
  I've struggled. 
  I've had difficulty in the wake of my husband's death, and I've engaged in in In self-destructive behavior, including, um including sexual encounters and Celeste. 
  Please, let me, I'm I'm not gonna look you in the eye and say that I'm healed, but I will say this: I am in the process of healing, and And through it all, I've always been a good mother. 
  I've always put my children's interests first, and I've always, always kept them safe, even when Perry even when there was a monster in the house. 
  Have you ever been violent with your children, Mrs. 
  Wright? 
  I overreacted on two occasions. 
  You ever strike your mother-in-law? 
  I slapped her in the face. 
  Ever push your husband down a flight of stairs? 
  No! 
  And how dare you? 
  How dare you? 
  This is a computer simulation of your husband's fatal fall. 
  Objection. 
  Relevance, - No, Your Honor. 
  - not to mention - unfair surprise. 
  - Your Honor can take a De bene. 
  Okay, this is off-the-charts prejudicial. 
  This isn't a jury trial, counsel, I'll give you time to impeach if you want. 
  This is where your husband would have landed from a natural fall. 
  Now, this is where he did land. 
  Oh! 
  This is Hmm. 
  The physics say that for him to have landed there, he must have been pushed. 
  So, I dare to ask did you push him? 
  No. 
  I did not. 
  How did he fall? 
  He lost his balance and he slipped. 
  He lost his balance immediately after you found out he'd been unfaithful with another woman who bore his child? 
  - Your Honor, this is not relevant. 
  - Not relevant? 
  She might commit a homicide, but hey. 
  - Objection. 
  - We can All right, the objection on relevance is sustained. 
  Thank you, Your Honor. 
  I have no further questions. 
  Thank you. 
  - Okay. 
  - sh1t. 
  God, Katie, you couldn't have cut any of that off? 
  Jesus Christ. 
  Oh my god, she was having me followed. 
  She was having me followed. 
  - I know, I think so. 
  - Unbelievable. 
  She had PIs on me. 
  God. 
  This is just Okay, that was rougher than we thought. 
  You think? 
  Jesus Christ. 
  I'll need to put you back on the stand. 
  - No - We need to rehabilitate you. 
 
 
 
  Deconstruct a lot of what just happened. 
  I don't think I can get back in that chair again. 
  I can't. 
  I'm sorry, but I think you have to. 
  You can't leave it like that. 
  You can't. 
  And you've been through so much, honey, but you have to fight for those boys. 
  You can't leave it like that. 
  I dare to ask, did you ever push your husband down a flight of stairs? 
  I did. 
  You have to fight for them. 
  They need you. 
  Well, I must say I was surprised to hear from you. 
  I have no intention of doing anything, okay? 
  Okay. 
  All right, part of me does want to do something, but I've already done it just by entertaining the idea even for a few minutes, I've done it. 
  Look, let me tell you what my shrink told me. 
  It's not about inflicting payback on your cheating spouse. 
  It's about getting a sense that you didn't just take it. 
  You didn't just swallow your pride and resign yourself to being some wimpy ass victim. 
  But you are looking for payback. 
  True. 
  I'd like both Joseph and Madeline to pay. 
  But I'm also attracted to you. 
  I keep both a masturbation diary and a bucket list. 
  - Lower your - You made both. 
  It's not just about me getting even. 
  It's about me getting you. 
  I want you. 
  Don't overthink it. 
  We have s*x. 
  We'll probably love it. 
  If we don't, we move on. 
  Of course, if we do love it, we do it again. 
  And again. 
  Jesus. 
  Oh, the joy come over me When you came into my Sweet love that you bring me Cut through my darkness like a knife Ed, I'm at a loss. 
  I just hope I can convince you that I'm incapable of doing something that I already did. 
  I just I hope I can earn back your trust. 
  Madeleine, there's nothing I want more than to trust you. 
  And that said, I can't just wave a wand. 
  Neither can you. 
  What are you doing? 
  You know she's a good mother. 
  You need to call this off. 
  Oh, I know I thought about doing exactly that. 
  I really did. 
  But then, I I considered the boys and I She's not well. 
  Clearly, you can see that. 
  No, what I see is a woman who's struggling. 
  Who isn't? 
  Are you struggling, Jane? 
  With your conscience, perhaps? 
  Ziggy told me you purchased a gun. 
  Did you plan to use it on my son? 
  Did you move to Monterey to hunt him down? 
  Actually, I came to Monterey in search of a good man. 
  A good man who happened to have a bad night. 
  Do you know the difficulty that my son is gonna have to face being a product of rape because of your f*cking son? 
  He was not a good man! 
  Yeah, maybe I would have f*cking shot him. 
  I didn't get the f*cking chance! 
  - Good night. 
  - Good night, babies. 
  Sounds like somebody's having a party. 
  Uh, you guys go ahead and put your mom's food on the counter. 
  I'll tell her it's here. 
  Okay. 
  It's my own design It's my own remorse Help me to decide - Help me make - Oh, hey. 
  - The most of freedom - Hey. 
  - I I can explain. 
  - And of pleasure I was just cleaning out my closet, you know, and I found my wedding dress in the back. 
  Just kinda reminded me of a certain time when I was a different person and I was so sure that I was gonna be a great wife. 
  Anyway, this is where it gets stupid, - so brace yourself for this part. 
  - Okay. 
  I put on the veil and then tried to put on the dress, but it doesn't fit but we're not talking about that Uh just so I could reconnect to that person, and then I put on this song 'cause 'cause you picked this song for our wedding and it always makes me dance. 
  So, that's, uh, pretty much it. 
  Now you're up to speed. 
  And I'm also out of breath. 
  Well, like I said before, you can't just wave a wand. 
  But that was pretty f*cking close. 
  Go towards the light, baby. 
  Sing it right Once or twice Oh, lordy me - Didn't I shake sugaree? 
  - Any change? 
  Mm-mm. 
  None. 
  Everything I got is done and pawned Everything I got is done and pawned - Pawn my watch - This yours? 
  Yes. 
  - Pawn my chain - All right there, big girl, we gotta go. 
  - Pawn everything - Come here, sweetie. 
  - In my name - Hi. 
  Did I ever tell you you're the best daughter in the world? 
  Didn't I shake sugaree? 
  I love you. 
  I love you too. 
  - Bye. 
  - Bye, sweetie. 
  You okay? 
  Pawn my buggy Horse and cart Pawn everything that was on my lot Oh, lordy me didn't I shake sugaree Everything I got is done and pawned I want to go back to yesterday, when counsel asked you about the other men. 
  I have to admit, we were all a bit thrown by it. 
  - I was thrown. 
  - Mm. 
  I mean, I'm clearly still struggling. 
  Are you getting professional help? 
  Yes. 
  Yes, I am, and I've stopped taking the Ambien. 
  And the other? 
  Are we dealing with some kind of sexual addiction here? 
  No, there's no sexual addiction. 
  Mrs. 
  Wright, something seems to be going on here. 
  These encounters - Are you getting help for this? 
  - I will. 
  - You will? 
  - Yes. 
  Why haven't you? 
  I think I've been too ashamed. 
  To tell your therapist, even? 
  Especially my therapist. 
  Why is that? 
  Because she's worked so hard on me, and I think I just I desperately wanted to see myself through her eyes and see progress. 
  It seems like risky behavior. 
  How am I trust that this will stop? 
  Because it will stop. 
  It will. 
  It has stopped. 
  All right, I have to be honest here. 
  It gives me pause. 
  I need you to explain to me, as best you can, what you think is going on here. 
  I wanted to be touched. 
  I wanted it I wanted it to be uncomplicated, and I wanted to be in control, so And as it was said yesterday, um, the violence with Perry would sometimes lead to s*x, which would I mean, it's it's just It's confusing, so I think that's And it sickens me. 
  And so that's why I was engaging with the others, because I these other men, because I think I wanted to to be free of Perry, and I want to push him out. 
  - "Him" being your husband? 
  - Yes. 
  Yes. 
  Were you maybe looking to hurt yourself? 
  No, I really don't think I was doing that. 
  I think I just wanted to push him out. 
  Well, I am all too familiar that many women stay with their abusers. 
  Mm-hm. 
  Tell me why you stayed. 
  Um, because I loved him, and I thought And but I I just always thought he would get better. 
  - But he didn't. 
  - No, he didn't. 
  And when I was happy, I stayed because I was happy and when I was depressed, I stayed because I was depressed. 
  I mean, either way, I was afraid if I left him of what he might do. 
  I was afraid how he would react. 
  I was afraid of being alone. 
  I was So I stayed. 
  I stayed to survive. 
  I stayed for my boys. 
  Yeah. 
  I'm good. 
  Mr. 
  Farber. 
  Thank you. 
  I dare to ask I'm right here, Mama. 
  Can you see me? 
  How you doing? 
  Well, it looks like it's time. 
  I have to confess something that I'm not so proud of. 
  And as I was writing I realized I needed to confess to you first. 
  So, here it goes. 
  I resent you for the childhood I had. 
  I resent you for your impatience for being scared of doing my homework without being yelled at for all the kitchen cabinet doors you slammed for slapping me, for all the bruises. 
  I resent you for not feeling safe at home. 
  I resent you for being ashamed of me. 
  I resent you for all the s*x I started to have when I was 13 to prove to myself that I could be loved. 
  I resent you for my wanting to beat the sh1t out of everyone. 
  I resent you for making me feel so f*cking worthless that I settled for a man that I don't But mainly I resent you for killing a man. 
  I killed Celeste's husband, and he didn't slip. 
  I pushed him. 
  I snapped, and when I lunged at him, I I was pushing you. 
  And that push was a long time coming. 
  And I wanna forgive you. 
  There was an incident where a little girl was being bullied, bitten, choked. 
  The bully was your son. 
  My sons are good boys. 
  So, given your struggles, why not let them stay with their grandmother while you heal. 
  I am their mother. 
  And they belong with me. 
  - Robert Johannsson. 
  - Yeah. 
  And this was for a model train? 
  A Lionel Union Pacific Car. 
  It's, uh, vintage. 
  Stated value is 2,200 dollars. 
  It's probably worth closer to 3,000. 
  Duly noted. 
  Marshall Brickman. 
  No Marshall Brickman? 
  All right, Juliette Dubois. 
  I didn't know And you're seeking severance in the amount of 72,000 dollars? 
  Yes, sir. 
  I worked there for six years. 
  Okay. 
  And what is this "other" listed? 
  Hundred and sixty thousand dollars? 
  That's for other services rendered, for which I was promised to be taken care of. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  And what other services? 
  Uh, stress management. 
  Can you be more specific? 
  I just like to leave it at that if I could. 
  I still love you. 
  You know that, right? 
  Shut the f*ck up for the rest of your fucked-up f*cking life. 
  Do you hear me? 
  I don't wanna hear one f*cking word from your fucked-up little f*cking twerp mouth on why you f*cked up, no matter what fucked-up excuse you come up with. 
  You f*cking f*ck sh1t! 
  f*cking! 
  The f*cking nanny? 
 ! 
  All rise. 
  Be seated. 
  As I said, I find the psychiatric reports and the custody evals a bit of a wash, but I think I have a pretty good grasp of what we're dealing with here. 
  And I'm prepared to enter my finding at this time. 
  In the case Mrs. 
  Wright. 
  I would like to call a witness. 
  I don't think a character witness - would carry much weight - This is not a character witness. 
  You've been asked to decide where my boys would be better off. 
  That puts in question the petitioner's fitness as well. 
  I was examined. 
  She should be too. 
  There has been no suggestion that my client's parental capacity - is up for review. 
  - I'm making that suggestion now. 
  I was fair game. 
  So is she. 
  All right. 
  We will schedule the petitioner's testimony for Tuesday. 
  And with the court's permission, I would like to question her myself. 
  I don't think that's wise. 
  I'm an attorney. 
  I have a current bar license. 
  I'm entitled to participate in my own defense. 
  That may very well be true, but I don't think it's in your best interest. 
  It's my fight, Your Honor. 
  I ask that you let me wage it. 
  Very well. 
  Tuesday at one o'clock. 
  Until then, we're adjourned
