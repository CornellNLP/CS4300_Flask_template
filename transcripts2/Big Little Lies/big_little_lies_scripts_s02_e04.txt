 02x04 - She Knows Do you? 
  Have you considered why you strayed? 
  Why were you unfaithful? 
  What have you done this time? 
  I see you drowning right now in a way. 
  We're throwing Amabella a birthday party, and I'm sparing no cost; she's unhappy. 
  There's something going on - with you. 
  - Correct. 
  My husband put us in the poorhouse. 
  JANE CHAPMAN: Uh.. 
  I just gotta idle in neutral for a little bit. 
  That's kind of my MO right now. 
  MARY LOUISE WRIGHT: (CHUCKLING) 
  Yes. 
  JANE: Oh, my God. 
  He looks just like Ziggy. 
  I should like to be in Ziggy's life. 
  I... 
  I mean, I'm... 
  I'm his grandmother.

  He's right there. 
  - Ziggy's over there. 
  There he is. 
  That's an intriguing...

  I think we're all a little shocked.

  Hi. 
  Uh... 
  I don't believe I have. 
  I would certainly remember. 
  So beautiful.

  I got a unit in your building.

  - Because there are boundaries, Mary Louise. 
  MARY LOUISE: Well, where would you have me go? 
  Canada? 
  This is all beginning to feel a little perverse. 
  - I beg your pardon? 
  - You're moving in with your son's rape victim. 
  - For God's sake, it's not right. 
  - I'm not moving in with her. 
  We're in the same building complex. 
  - No. 
  This is... 
  - And by the way, I'm not as convinced as you are, perhaps, that she was a rape victim. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  I can't...

  Pumpkin carving project. 
  The school decided to celebrate Halloween this week. 
  God forbid they wait until the end of the month. 
  I swear everyone in this town is obsessed with first and better and most. 
  Speaking of which, it's Amabella's birthday disco party tomorrow. 
  It's not even her f*cking birthday. 
  I mean, is it too much to ask people to check people's calendars and then get back to them accordingly? 
  We all have calendar apps on our phone, for God's sake. 
  (SIGHS) 
  What? 
  Why are you staring at me? 
  Um... 
  You know, there's never any middle ground with you. 
  Like, when you're upset... 
  it's... 
  charge. 
  Full speed ahead. 
  If there's a problem, charge. 
  If there was a problem with us, where was the... 
  charge?

  And I apologized for that. 
  I've...

  It's meant to be shared, you know. 
  Grief. 
  It's... 
  insurmountable. 
  Too difficult a battle to be waged alone. 
  Which is what you had to do. 
  You were alone... 
  after the accident. 
  Your husband left. 
  Perry told me. 
  Yes, he... 
  blamed me. 
  And he left. 
  And I deserved the blame. 
  To be left. 
  You know, Ray... 
  made a new life. 
  He... 
  got a new family. 
  He became a devoted father, so I'm told. 
  It's... 
  It's good. 
  People can move on after tragedy, just not together sometimes.

  It's a workshop.

  Not words like "hot" and "cold." Uh-huh.

  So is this the party line around here? 
  That I'm unhinged?

  Pretty much. 
  Great.

  Because they can't. 
  All right? 
  He had to pluck a zillion strings to get this through on a Saturday with nobody else around.

  It's not like a scarlet letter. 
  People file for bankruptcy all the time. 
  Some even go on to become president. 
  Let's just keep this thing moving along. 
  I've got a party to throw. 
  Absolutely no mention of that whatsoever to the trustee. 
  All right? 
  Am I clear? 
  JOHN DAVIDSON: So this represents your assets - in their entirety? 
  - GORDON KLEIN: Yes, sir. 
  Condo in Aspen. 
  Four bedroom vacation home in Palm Beach, including a -foot Red Sea Yacht. 
  GORDON: The Amabella. 
  DAVIDSON: Any other recreational or vacation home? 
  GORDON: No, sir. 
  DAVIDSON: Estimated liability is million dollars? 
  Uh, yes, but most of that is pending civil lawsuits, and we expect to be able to settle well within that range. 
  You really don't get to settle anything anymore, Mr. 
  Klein. 
  That all falls on me. 
  Your residence has been listed for sale? 
  Uh, yes. 
  We expect to go for north of . 
  RENATA: At least. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  DAVIDSON: Again, my decision, not yours. 
  Any other legal actions pending? 
  Right to sue? 
  Any punitive judgments in your favor? 
  GORDON: No, sir. 
  Any expectation of inheritance in the next months? 
  GORDON: No, sir. 
  Parents in good health? 
  Are you serious? 
  GORDON: Uh, yes, they're in good health. 
  (PAPERS RUSTLING) 
  Do you stand to inherit? 
  I'm self-made. 
  I see a charge for dollars to Morris-Simmons Lab. 
  Can anybody tell me what that's for? 
  Medical. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Did you submit to insurance? 
  - RENATA: No. 
  - Why not? 
  RENATA: Because it's... 
  It wouldn't be declared as insurance. 
  Well, what is it? 
  It's medical. 
  Like I said the first time. 
  DAVIDSON: I don't think you follow here, Mrs. 
  Klein. 
  See this... 
  is a bankruptcy hearing. 
  And I can deny your petition. 
  GORDON: Renata... 
  From dealing with men like you all my life. 
  Okay? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Going forward, disallow. 
  I have here a listing of your jewelry, which doesn't include that Rolex watch you're wearing. 
  I'll take it. 
  - GORDON: You mean mine? 
  - RENATA: Are you kidding? 
  WALTER RUTTENBURG: John, come on. 
  It doesn't include that either.

  - Thank you! 
  - Good to see you. 
  - Even better than Frozen. 
  - Do you promise? 
  HARPER STIMSON: Oh, my gosh! 
  - You better not be lying to me. 
  - Just amazing. 
  HARPER: I'm not lying, and I also wanna borrow your dress. 
  - Is that weird? 
  - Uh, no. 
  You own it. 
  - Oh, my God! 
  - That was insane! 
  - Disco was genius. 
  - RENATA: Really? 
  It was, wasn't it. 
  - Oh, thank you so much. 
  Thank you. 
  - Yeah, it was great. 
  RENATA: We've got one for you. 
  BONNIE: I know someone had a great time. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  I had a ball! 
  - That... 
  Oh, no! 
  You... 
  on that dance floor. 
  It was amazing. 
  - ELIZABETH: It was a ball. 
  - (BOTH LAUGH) 
  All right. 
  Thank you. 
  RENATA: I'm so happy you were here. 
  BONNIE: Mama. 
  You okay? 
  - BONNIE: Mom? 
  - RENATA: Elizabeth? 
  - BONNIE: What's wrong with her? 
  - Elizabeth? 
  - Oh, my God! 
  Mom! 
  Oh, my God! 
  - Mom! 
  - BONNIE: Mom! 
  Mom! 
  - Watch her head. 
  Watch her head. 
  Oh my God! 
  Somebody call ! 
  What the f*ck is happening to her? 
  (SCREAMS FADE) 
  BONNIE: So what happened? 
  She had a stroke, which most likely caused the seizure. 
  We're gonna take her into surgery now and clean out a carotid artery in her neck. 
  It's good that you got her here so quickly. 
  As soon as we know more, I'll let you know. 
  She just dropped like a stone. 
  (SOBS) 
  I seriously thought she was gonna die. 
  It really makes you take stock of things. 
  You okay? 
  No. 
  I'm far from okay. 
  Look, if you're gonna leave me, can you just do it? 
  Can you just get it over with? 
  Wh... 
  I mean, I'm still here, aren't I? 
  MADELINE: Is that what you think, Ed? 
  You're far from here. 
  You're not even f*cking close. 
  ♪ ("JESUS IS WAITING" BY AL GREEN PLAYS) 
  ♪ I had a really weird thing happen earlier when I was dancing with Corey. 
  Um... 
  everything was going fine, it was great, and then, he moved his hand, and... 
  my mind froze, and my body recoiled and kinda had this spasm. 
  It's really frustrating because I'm doing so well, and then something like that happens. 
  - CELESTE: Hmm. 
  - And it's like, am I ever gonna be able to be sexual again? 
  Can you relate to that? 
  Did he ever... 
  Did Perry ever rape you? 
  JOE: How we doing? 
  Another round? 
  JANE: No, I'm good. 
  Thank you, actually. 
  It'll happen. 
  - JANE: So he didn't? 
  - No. 
  No, he didn't. 
  JANE: I'm gonna swing by the hospital on my way - and just check up on Bonnie. 
  - CELESTE: Mm-hmm. 
  Would you tell her that my boys are with Mary Louise tonight, so... if she... 
  if she wants anything, I'm here. 
  - Ugh... 
  okay. 
  - (CELESTE CHUCKLES) 
  Bye. 
  - Love you. 
  - Love you. 
  - (SIGHS) 
  - So what's it gonna be? 
  CELESTE: Oh, what the hell, I'll have another one. 
  Good choice. 
  (HEART MONITOR BEEPS) 
  MARTIN HOWARD: Looking for Elizabeth Howard. 
  - NURSE: She's right through... 
  - BONNIE: Dad. 
  - Hi. 
  - MARTIN: Hi. 
  She okay? 
  I think. 
  What'd the surgeon say? 
  Her brain scans showed some bleeding, but um... 
  it's minimal, so... 
  we won't know anything else till she wakes up. 
  MARTIN: Did you say something to her? 
  Before the incident, did you say something? 
  You mean, did I cause this? 
  - MARTIN: I didn't mean that. 
  - Yeah, you did. 
  It's just that you... 
  know how easily upset she gets. 
  I didn't cause her f*cking stroke. 
  (WHISPERING) 
  Calm down. 
  What if she can hear you? 
  Okay... 
  I'm gonna let you sit with her for a while. 
  Okay? 
  MARTIN: (FAINTLY) 
  I'm here, baby. 
  MARY LOUISE: It's the best pizza in the world! 
  That's what your dad used to say. 
  When he was your age. 
  You know that? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  - He said that with us too. 
  - MARY LOUISE: He did? 
  Did he teach you how to stretch the cheese? 
  - (CHUCKLING) 
  Yeah. 
  - Stretch the cheese. 
  BOYS: Mm-hmm. 
  MARY LOUISE: (LAUGHING) 
  Nothing better in the world. 
  MAX: If Dad was here, he would eat a whole pizza to himself. 
  He is. 
  He is here, in a way. 
  You know, people are never really gone. 
  'Cause they live on in the hearts of those they leave behind. 
  We just have to... 
  keep your dad here. 
  In our hearts. 
  Right? 
  Right? 
  It's the best pizza in the world!

  BONNIE: Seriously? 
  - Excuse me? 
  - What the f*ck? 
  JANE: Bonnie. 
  Hey. 
  Sorry. 
  - She chooses now? 
  - No, no, no, she's here some DUI fatality or something. 
  I ran into her downstairs. 
  It's something else. 
  CORTLAND: She's just a daughter of a patient. 
  I know who she is. 
  MARY LOUISE: I so wanted to bring the boys to church, but Max was adamantly opposed. 
  He thinks that God is a douchebag. 
  His language, not mine. 
  - Hi, Mommy. 
  - CELESTE: (WEAKLY) 
  Hi. 
  - You all right? 
  - CELESTE: Yeah, I'm fine. 
  - Just didn't sleep very well, you know? 
  - MARY LOUISE: Yeah. 
  JOSH: We had pulled pizza last night. 
  - CELESTE: Did you? 
  - BOYS: Yeah. 
  MAX: We stretched the cheese like Daddy used to do. 
  Well, that sounds really fun. 
  JOSH: And we saw Ziggy this morning. 
  He lives in Grandma's building. 
  - CELESTE: Hmm. 
  Great. 
  - What's the matter? 
  Celeste, what's wrong? 
  I just... 
  I don't know, I feel like I'm coming down with something. 
  - MARY LOUISE: Hmm? 
  Yeah. 
  - I just feel like... 
  Very zonked. 
  JOSH: You look funny. 
  Hmm... 
  No fever. 
  What a mess! 
  - Good lord... 
  - JOE: Hey... 
  How we all doin'? 
  I gotta... 
  Hey, buddy. 
  MARY LOUISE: And who do we have with us today? 
  JOE: I'm, uh... 
  I'm Joe. 
  - MARY LOUISE: Hi. 
  - JOE: Hi. 
  Sorry. 
  MARY LOUISE: So... 
  Shall we... 
  - Let's get clean, shall we? 
  - (DOOR SLAMS) 
  MADELINE: Wait, did you take Ambien again? 
  And you didn't even remember he was in the house? 
  I couldn't... 
  I didn't even realize where I was when they came running in, I just... 
  Look, you're entitled to have a private life. 
  She said she was taking the boys for a sleepover. 
  CELESTE: I know, and then she comes in at a... 
  I mean, it must have been like... 
  Yeah, she should have called you first or texted you. 
  You can't just, like, barge in on people like that. 
  I dropped the boys off at Jane's, if that's all right. 
  So that we could have a... 
  conversation. 
  MADELINE: Is that your hint for me to leave? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Okay. 
  - (SOFTLY) 
  It's all right. 
  - Okay, I'll call you later. 
  (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) 
  (DOOR CLOSES) 
  MARY LOUISE: (SIGHS) 
  Celeste... 
  I do think you need to take some... 
  some real time to heal, and that while you do that, I think Max and Josh should... 
 reside with me. 
  No. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  No. 
  That won't be necessary. 
  No, I... 
  I think it is nec... 
  It is necessary. 
  Look, last night was a misunderstanding... 
  No, no, this is not about last night. 
  It's about a whole totality of events. 
  (SIGHS) 
  You're a mess, Celeste. 
  And until you're better, we just have to think about... 
  protecting the wellbeing of our boys. 
  We should at least be able to agree on that. 
  Hmm? 
  My boys will not be going to live with you. 
  But they're at risk here. 
  They're at risk in your care. 
  And I'm their grandmother, and I will not forsake them, and I will not forsake what I know Perry would want me to... 
  To do for them. 
  I need you to get outta here. 
  - Right now. 
  - Well, we can calmly... 
  - CELESTE: No, no. 
  - Celeste... 
  (YELLING) 
  Get the f*ck out of here! 
  Okay, I'm going to give you this as a courtesy. 
  What? 
  - It's a... 
  - What is it? 
  - A petition... 
  - No! 
  ... for assignment of the guardian of the person. 
  - What? 
  - Persons. 
  - It's plural in this case. 
  - What? 
  It'll be filed in the Monterey County Superior Court tomorrow morning. 
  We need to do what's best for the boys. 
  (GASPS) 
  She could really lose her kids? 
  Maybe. 
  It's California law, and it's very tricky. 
  - You got her a good lawyer. 
  - RENATA: Good. 
  She's good. 
  But... 
  I would have had her hire Ira Farber, and now I hear Mary Louise got him and that's why he was unavailable. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - It's just... 
  everything feels like it's unraveling, and now... 
  I mean, Bonnie, I don't know how she's... 
  - keeping it together. 
  - I heard her mother is stable... 
  - ADRIENNE: Hey, Madeline. 
  - Oh. 
  MADELINE AND RENATA: Hello. 
  Renata. 
  It's nice to see you both. 
  You well? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Great. 
  - Yeah. 
  - You? 
  Hey, I heard you gave a great talk other night at Otter Bay Assembly. 
  Wish I'd seen that. 
  People pull out their iPhones all the time at these sorts of things. 
  I'm sure it's posted somewhere - on Instagram or something. 
  - (RENATA CHUCKLES) 
  I'll look for it. 
  Have a good day. 
  RENATA: What the f*ck was that? 
  - (KNOCKING) 
  - Hi, Jane. 
  - JANE: Hi. 
  - What a surpri... 
  Can we have a conversation, please? 
  Of course, come in. 
  Can I get you a cup of tea? 
  No, I'm fine. 
  I'm just a little bit curious as to what you're doing and if you plan to take my kid next. 
  What? 
  What would make you think that I would seek custody of Ziggy? 
  You're a wonderful, wonderful mother. 
  So is Celeste! 
  No. 
  No, no. 
  I have concerns about Celeste. 
  Her mental and emotional health... 
  I know you're her friend, Jane. 
  But truly, do you not also worry? 
  - No. 
  No, I don't. 
  - Well, put yourself in my shoes. 
  If you became convinced - that the boys were at risk... 
  - They're not at risk. 
  - Physically at risk. 
  - I've seen her as a mom! 
  She's a great parent. 
  You have seen the outward appearance, but I've seen the drawer, with... 
  uh, Ambien and... 
  And Vicodin and, uh, Xanax, something with a... 
  "Trama..." I don't know! 
  All these different medications, and she's driving on these roads. 
  Let me ask you, do you ever put Ziggy in the car with her? 
  Does he sit in the front next to her when the twins are strapped in the back? 
  Are you okay with that? 
  (ENGINE HUMS) 
  AMANDA REISMAN: I'm not gonna testify against you... 
  But they might be able to force you. 
  They might be able to, I don't know, get a court order. 
  Celeste, first of all, you can trust me. 
  I trusted her, so don't talk to me about trust right now. 
  I let her into my life. 
  I let her into my house. 
  I tried to help her. 
  Whatever you say to me is doctor-patient privileged. 
  You know that. 
  CELESTE: I just don't feel strong enough to handle this. 
  They're gonna wanna interview the kids, and they've been through enough. 
  We've all been through enough, for God's sake. 
  - (SNIFFS) 
  - Maybe you can settle? 
  Don't tell me to f*cking settle. 
  I'm not settling anything with that woman. 
  God. 
  These are my kids. 
  And she wants them. 
  She wants my boys. 
  DR. 
  REISMAN: If she's seeking custody on the grounds of parental unfitness... 
  or neglect... 
  CELESTE: Whose side are you on, for God's sake? 
  I've seen the way these things play out. 
  - Nobody wins. 
  - I will win. 
  I'll f*cking win. 
  (SIGHS) 
  God.
