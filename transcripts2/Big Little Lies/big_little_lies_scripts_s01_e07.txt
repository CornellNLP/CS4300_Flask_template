 Perry: Get up.    
 - (grunts) 
- Celeste, you're fine.    
 Oh...    
 - (taps) 
- Hey.    
 Uh... (gasps)    
 Hey.    
 Hey, you just got the wind knocked out of you.    
 Max: Mom, we got to go.    
 (crying)    
 Hey, hey, hey.    
 Hey, Mommy isn't feeling well today,    
 so I'm going to take you guys to school.    
 What's wrong with her?    
 Her tummy's a little upset.    
 She's... she's okay.    
 But that means that the monster will take you to school instead.    
 I'll be right down, guys.    
 (music continues)    
 (groaning)    
 (whimpers)    
 (twins giggling)    
 (crying)    
 (gasps)    
 I'm sorry, Sparkles.    
 - (Celeste sobbing) 
- (seagulls screeching)    
 The only mystery to me is why all the damn questions?    
 I mean, you know who did it, for God's sake.    
 Chloe, there's a zero-tolerance policy on tardiness, young lady.    
 - Let's go. 
- Chloe: Coming, woman.    
 Get your butt over here.    
 Ed: Well, she still has yet to launch it.    
 That's a good sign.    
 Abigail... there's no sign of a launch on her Facebook page.    
 So you're Facebook stalking her after you got up on your Clydesdale about it?    
 What exactly did you say to her, anyway?    
 Common sense... I said live right or go straight to hell.    
 Are you having your period?    
 Get in the car.    
 Ed: Are you?    
 Are you trying to be funny?    
 Trying to be serious. What is going on with you?    
 I have to get her to school.    
 (door slams)    
 (birds chirping)    
 - Joseph: You sure it was Tori? 
- (engine starts)    
 Does she drive a gray Saturn?    
 She was just driving slowly by your house?    
 Clearly she knows about us, Joseph.    
 First of all, she flat-out accuses me,    
 and now she's going all Glenn Close?    
 She suspects, she doesn't know.    
 I did a good job of denying it.    
 Not that my capacity for denial would be a fraction of yours.    
 Yeah, well, I'm busy.    
 (scoffs)    
 - The thing about you, Madeline, is that... 
- The thing about me?    
 Let me finish!    
 Central to your core is your grossly,    
 if not artificially inflated, sense of moral integrity.    
 For you to be f*cking me for three months    
 - like a mad hyena in heat... 
- How dare you speak to me like that?    
 ...could only mean that, yes, not only were you in love with me,    
 you had the best s*x of your life.    
 You've gone so far in the direction of wrong.    
 Oh, yeah? Then why are you here?    
 You could've called me.    
 What, you wanna f*ck me again? Let's do it.    
 There's no one in the building.    
 On the couch, come on. Me and you.    
 What, you think you own this town 'cause you have money,    
 you self-entitled rich bitch?    
 Just get the f*ck out of my office!    
 I'll see you at the party tonight.    
 (Celeste sighs)    
 - (groans) 
- Tsk, oh, God.    
 Don't touch me, please. Just...    
 (sighs, sniffles)     
 I got the apartment.     
 - Are you in it? 
- (exhales)     
 Is the refrigerator stocked?     
 You going to leave him?     
 (sighs)     
 He's going away in the morning, so...     
 Okay.     
 We just have to go to the school gala tonight and...     
 - Oh, Jesus. 
- (sighs)     
 It's one thing should he kill you,     
 but God forbid you miss a party.     
 You know, your husband is ill, Celeste, but so are you.     
 There are... children in the house.     
 I told you, he will not hurt the children.     
 He will never hurt the children.     
 God!     
 It's all right, I'm fine.     
 (sighs)     
 Jane: Yeah, I sent the invoice    days ago.     
 Great, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.     
 Bye.     
 (clears throat)     
 (thermometer beeping)     
 How's it looking?     
   . .     
 It doesn't get more normal than that.     
 All right, buddy, tell me what's going on.     
 (TV turns off)     
 You've had two bowls of cereal,     
 you're watching cartoons, you don't have a fever.     
 Do you actually feel sick     
 or do you just not want to go to school?     
 I feel sick.     
 You don't sound congested.     
 I have aches.     
 Is it possible your heart aches     
 'cause the other kids were told not to play with you?     
 'Cause I would certainly understand that.     
 Friends play with me.     
 Josh, Chloe, Skye, Amabella.     
 Amabella Klein plays with you?     
 Yeah, we're friends. 
She likes Star Wars, too.     
 It's not me who hurts her.     
 I know, baby.     
 Do you know who is hurting her?     
 Who is it?     
 I don't like to talk about it.     
 Well, you don't have a choice. 
You have to talk about it.     
 Tell me who it is.     
 I promised.     
 Look, sometimes it is important     
 to keep promises, but other times...     
 - No, I promised. 
- Who did you promise?     
 I promised Amabella.     
 You've known all of this time and you've just been taking the blame?     
 I only just found out.     
 Who is it?     
 She said if I told, she might get killed dead.     
 She...     
 Okay.     
 You promised her you wouldn't say anything, right?     
 But you can still point.     
 Right?     
 You point and show me who it is...     
 and I promise you Amabella will not get killed dead.     
 Who is it?     
 Ziggy, look at me.     
 Amabella has been a really good friend to you, right?     
 Yeah.     
 It's our turn to be a good friend to her.     
 It's not fair that she keeps getting hurt.     
 We have to protect her, right?     
 Ziggy, point to who it is.     
 - Really? 
- I don't know what to do.     
 Well, you have to tell Celeste.     
 She's going to want to hear it directly from you.     
 Honesty is always the best policy, that's what I...     
 I mean, I knew the boys roughhouse a lot,     
 but I didn't know they were bullies.     
 - Jane: It was only Max. 
- Hey.     
 Ziggy was very clear about that.     
 Are you so relieved about Ziggy?     
 - Jane: Yeah. 
- Hi, sorry... to interrupt.     
 Hi, Madeline.     
 Jane, Gordon Klein, Renata's husband.     
 - We met at the school that day. 
- Yeah, of course.     
 I'm wondering if we might have a private conversation     
 just for a second.     
 - Sure. 
- Yeah?     
 Well, I'm feeling a little excluded.     
 We're in the middle of a conversation.     
 Okay. Actually, no, that's good.     
 You need to hear this since the two of you seem to be making quite the little team.     
 (grunts)     
 Look, Jane, whether or not Ziggy is the one who's been hurting Amabella,     
 - you're the one who... 
- Jane: Actually, there's...     
 ...you're the one who attacked my wife.     
 Now, please understand that if you ever go near Renata again,     
 I'll be taking a restraining order...     
 Tom: All right, all right. Gordon, that's enough.     
 I'm going to have to ask you to leave.     
 Tom, Tom. We're just talking. Everything is fine.     
 No, no, everything's not fine. I can't have you in here harassing my customers.     
 - (laughing) 
- Now, I'm asking you politely, please.     
 - I don't think you have the right... 
- Please go.     
 I don't think you have the right to remove me from the premises.     
 I'm not interested in your legal advice.     
 - Just go, Gordon. 
- (laughs)     
 Just remember what I said, okay?     
 Mm-hmm.     
 - Okay? 
- Yes.     
 Madeline.     
 Look, I'm sure I'll see you some other time,     
 just not today, okay?     
 You just lost yourself a lot of customers, my friend.     
 (seagull screeching)     
 (exhales)     
 Unbelievable.     
 I'm so sorry.     
 That was really impressive.     
 - Are you okay? 
- Yeah.     
 You're a real prince, Tom. I would've told him to go f*ck himself.     
 - (Jane laughs) 
- But I don't talk like that.     
 All right, I'm off to transform myself into My Fair Lady.     
 - Call Celeste, okay? 
- I will.     
 - Bye, Tom. 
- Tom: Bye.     
 You know, uh, I've actually been     
 trying to figure out a way to impress you for a while now.     
 I just haven't had my chance.     
 You... you're straight?     
 What?     
 (school bell rings)     
 How was your day, baby-cakes?     
 - Well, TGIF. 
- (whistle trills)     
 Ugh, you're telling me.     
 I was either starting fights today or joining in.     
 Nathan: Hey, Maddie!     
 Hey.     
 Are you ready for Trivia Night tonight? You're coming, I presume.     
 Yeah, I'll be the one dressed as Audrey Hepburn.     
 (chuckles) That's funny.     
 Listen, um, Bonnie and I went to see a counselor today,     
 one that specializes in teenagers.     
 And I just wanted to share something with you.     
 Wait a second, you went to see a counselor?     
 Yeah.     
 He thinks that this is a kind of, um, scream for attention.     
 - Mm. 
- Divorce messes kids up pretty good.     
 Oh, so splitting up can negatively affect the kids?     
 Wish I had known that before I walked out.     
 Wait, did I?     
 Why do you gotta turn everything into a f*cking fight?     
 (sighs) You know what, Nathan?     
 I'm glad you're taking this parenting thing seriously.     
 I really am.     
 You know, despite all of our sh1t, I root for you.     
 I appreciate that.     
 Oh, uh, just so you know,     
 Bonnie is going to be singing tonight at the talent thingy.     
 Maddie, she's good.     
 She's, like, really good.     
 Chloe: Good to know.     
 Knowing what I know now,     
 I'm surprised there wasn't more carnage on Trivia Night.     
 One dead? We definitely got off light.     
 (seagulls screeching)     
 (sighs)     
 (exhales)     
 (no audible dialogue)     
 (sighs)     
 (sobbing)     
 (phone chiming)     
 Oh.     
 Hello?     
 - Hey. 
- Hi.     
 Thank you for meeting me.     
 What is it?     
 Ziggy...     
 Ziggy told me this morning that...     
 apparently, it was Max who choked Amabella at orientation.     
 And apparently, it's been him who's been bullying her all along.     
 What?     
 Yeah.     
 Amabella told Ziggy, but made him promise not to tell     
 because Max threatened to hurt her more if it got out,     
 so he's just been keeping the secret.     
 You're sure about this?     
 I mean, I definitely considered     
 that he could be lying just to protect himself.     
 And I have to face the fact that violence could be in his DNA,     
 given who his dad is.     
 I think he's telling the truth.     
 He said also that Max pushed Skye down the stairs,     
 um, and that he's been a little aggressive towards her as well.     
 (sighs)     
 I'm so sorry, Celeste, to tell you this.     
 They're kids, though, you know.     
 They bully. It's human nature.     
 They grow out of it.     
 Sometimes they don't.     
 (whimper echoes)     
 (Celeste grunts)     
 (faint singing)     
 Kelly, can I just have a moment, please?     
 Yeah, of course.     
 Max.     
 Come here.     
 What?     
 (Josh humming)     
 You need to tell me what you've been doing at school.     
 You're not gonna get in trouble,     
 but you gotta tell me the truth.     
 Do you understand?     
 (whispers) We all do bad things sometimes, all right?     
 I can help you with them, but you need to tell me. (sniffles)     
 It's all right, baby. It's all right.     
 (crying)     
 And then he said, "I'll see you tonight,"     
 which sounded like a threat.     
 I seriously doubt he's gonna blow up his life.     
 Why did you wanna blow up yours?     
 I wish I knew the answer to that.     
 I can't really make sense of it.     
 I think maybe...     
 sometimes I'm just holding on     
 to this idea of perfection so tight...     
 something has to give.     
 And I can't explain it.     
 And I won't excuse it.     
 I've been wanting to tell Ed for so long.     
 I just haven't found the courage.     
 Yet.     
 I decided not to go through with it.     
 - The project. 
- Oh, thank God.     
 (sighs)     
 It was pointed out to me, not by Bonnie,     
 that whatever attention I bring to the cause     
 will be buried under the controversy of my methodology,     
 so I'm gonna find another way.     
 Maybe I never really wanted to do it.     
 It was more of a publicity stunt,     
 you know, to raise awareness.     
 And to piss off your mom?     
 Don't start.     
 I really wish you hadn't confronted them like that.     
 I'm not just gonna stand around and do nothing.     
 Oh great, I'm the one that's getting vilified.     
 Why would you be the one to get vilified?     
 Because I'm a working mom, I've told you.     
 Worse, a CEO, which deems me a bitch.     
 You have no idea.     
 If I get shot in the head tonight,     
 half these moms are gonna say,     
 "She couldn't bother herself to duck?     
 What, what, she couldn't get the nanny to stop the bullet?"     
 Trust me, these women, especially Madeline, they're vicious.     
 Let's blow this off tonight.     
 I'm serious.     
 Let's... let's just... let's not go.     
 Then we're demonized for blowing off a fundraiser?     
 No!     
 "What, the rich people,     
 they spend their money, but they don't have the wherewithal     
 to even show up and invest their time?"     
 That's not gonna work. Sorry!     
 Sorry, no. I hate everybody right now,     
 except Jane, believe it or not.     
 How funny is that?     
 Go get ready, Elvis.     
 This feels very dangerous.     
 (chuckles)     
 We're already late for the party     
 and you have the temerity to stand in the shower like this?     
 Do we really have to be on time?     
 Sorry to say we do.     
 Well, I'm not gonna budge.     
 Not until you at least give me a kiss.     
 - Hey. 
- (gasps) You look really pretty!     
 - Thank you! 
- You really do.     
 Oh, thanks!     
 I don't know how I'm gonna survive in these heels all night.     
 Well, you look exactly like Audrey Hepburn.     
 - Aw, thank you. 
- (knocking on door)     
 - Ziggy: Ooh, your date! 
- Shh.     
 - Hey. 
- Wow!     
 You look incredible.     
 Thank you. You look great, too.     
 Oh, I... I don't really do costumes.     
 I don't normally either, but Madeline roped me into it.     
 Mm-hmm. I rode my bike here and got us an Uber.     
 - Can I leave this? 
- Of course.     
 - Hi! 
- Tom: Hi, Ziggy.     
 Jane: I'll be seeing you in a few hours, okay?     
 - Ziggy: Okay. 
- Thanks again.     
 Lydia: No problem. Good night.

 The dress was inappropriate.     
 And desperate, if you ask me.     
 (laughing) He always does.

 Now, folks, don't forget to visit our mixologists.     
 They made a signature cocktail for this evening called the Otter Bay.     
 - Thank you.

 You otter try one! (chuckles)     
 We're currently reviewing our alcohol procedures     
 in relation to school events.     
 So, did you plan on telling me?     
 Or was I just to discover you gone when I got back from Hawaii?     
 The latter.     
 I told you I would get help.     
 Did you make an appointment?     
 No, but I will.     
 - I promise you.

 It's all too late.     
 (chatter)     
 - (tires screech) 
- (engine revs)     
 Where are you going?     
 We have a family, Celeste.     
 You have to think about the boys.     
 Max is the one that was hurting Amabella Klein.     
 It wasn't Ziggy Chapman, it was Max.     
 - How do you know? 
- Because I asked him and he admitted it     
 and Josh said it was true.     
 Okay. Well, we'll... we'll talk to the teachers.     
 No, I will talk to the teachers.     
 - (locks click) 
- Jesus, open the f*cking door, Perry.     
 - Open the f*cking door! 
- We will talk to the teachers together.     
 - Open the door. 
- Mother and father, husband and wife.     
 And I will talk to Max tomorrow morning     
 before I leave for the airport.     
 And what are you gonna say to him?     
 It's not the way a man should treat a woman?     
 That men should never hit women?     
 (sighs) Come on, is it any wonder that it was him?     
 - The boys have never seen anything. 
- You don't know that.     
 And if they haven't seen it, they've heard it.     
 They know what their father does to their mother.     
 You can't leave. You... you...     
 We... can we, uh... can we talk about it?     
 You're never gonna change. You know that.     
 I am gonna change!     
 I am.     
 I know I have this... this madness,     
 these f*cking demons in here.     
 But I am... I'm... I'm fighting them.     
 - I'm fighting them.

 Honey, what's wrong? Look at me.

 What's happening?     
 I cheated on Ed.     
 What?     
 I cheated on Ed.     
 It was a long time ago, but I... (sobs)     
 I feel like a horrible person.     
 I'm a liar. I'm a f*cking fake.     
 - No, you're not. 
- He's the greatest man I've ever known.     
 I feel like a selfish f*ck.     
 No, you're an amazing person.     
 And you're not perfect. Welcome to the club.

 - Hi.

 Okay. Maddie just ran away.     
 It was so weird.

 Let's hear it for Ed, everybody.     
 That was just special, Ed. Just special. Um...     
 Nippal: Folks, we're gonna take a quick break from our singing Elvises     
 so we can knock off the raffle.     
 And our trivia portion of the evening     
 will be starting in one hour.     
 And I'll give you the first question.     
 Which celebrity kept a pet deer,     
 Elvis or Audrey?     
 Think about it and we'll be right back.

- Harper: Good.     
 I just found out today.     
 Honey, Amabella pointed right at Ziggy.     
 No, no, because she was frightened of him,     
 of Max.     
 Harper: Is this custom-made?

 Yeah, exactly.

 No, I think you did, Nathan.

 I don't think you're sorry, actually.

 You're not happy with your performance up there?     
 Yeah?     
 You're gonna get your ass kicked tonight, you know that?

 Will you relax?

 I personally saw Ed Mackenzie     
 throw his drink at Bonnie Carlson.     
 I'm afraid to tell him.     
 I mean, I want to tell him,     
 but I'm afraid I will hurt him so bad.
