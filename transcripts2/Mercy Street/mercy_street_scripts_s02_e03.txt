 The medical exam. Apparently you never took it. 
 Smallpox? It's a nigger disease. 
 Anne : You've seen these spots?I 've treated typhoid. 
 She needs to be isolated. 
 I am tending a patient! 
 You'll stay. I promise. 
 Tell Alice that I love her. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Breathing rapidly] 
 I'll help you sneak through. 
 You'd need a password, uniform. 
 Alice : I have a house guest who's most friendly. 
 The current password at the picket is "persimmon." 
 You're a spy. 
 No! 
 Ah! 
 An unfinished letter will be left for the federal authorities saying he contemplates desertion. 
 [Gunshot] 
 ♪♪ 
 [Train whistle blows, horse galloping] 
 Man : Get on. 
 [Clicks teeth] 
 Easy. Easy. 
 Whoa. 
 [Horse snorts] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Grunting] 
 Jane : He's a man. Don't be so dainty. 
 Your vowels are too adorned. Start again. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Father. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Grunts] 
 Keep going. It'll be light soon. 
 We'll put lumber over to cover it. 
 Later, I'll have men drag the oak desk and some crates over here. 
 Nobody will want to move all that. 
 When you were a boy, you used to run around this place like a monkey. 
 Climb up in those rafters. 
 I'd chase you for hours. 
 You're not a boy anymore. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Man wolf-whistles] 
 Belinda, is no one down for breakfast yet? 
 Tired folks this morning. 
 Oh. 
 You spent the night over there? 
 I have a friend who's sick. 
 Let's check your fever. 
 I had strange dreams. 
 Visions. 
 What sort of visions? 
 [Glass clinks, liquid pours] 
 [Gasps lightly] 
 As a child, when I got sick, my father would recite a poem. 
 Both : "One equal temper of heroic hearts made weak by... something something... strong in will..." 
 I knew it so well once. I... 
 Strong in will and soon in body. 
 Isn't that so, Miss Hastings? 
 We certainly hope so. 
 I know sick nurses are sometimes sent home, but I don't want that. I must stay. 
 Please? 
 Don't worry. 
 I have nothing to return to. 
 You will remain here under my care. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 When we argued... about smallpox, about that night, I... 
 Not now. 
 [Sighs] 
 Not now. 
 We'll talk about everything soon. 
 And had I no obligations, I would stay with you all day, tend you and you alone, but... 
 Yes. Go see your patients. 
 I shall rest. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Time's up. They want the room. 
 Ask me, you don't need to learn nothing. 
 You know everything there is to about a woman's body. 
 [Giggles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 All right, Dr. Hale. 
 See you next time. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Sorry you didn't get a chance to go north. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 But I ain't sorry we get to keep you. 
 You were here all night? 
 You have an objection to that? 
 I don't expect a man to work himself to death. 
 Don't worry yourself over me. 
 It pains you, what you had to do. 
 I know. I feel for you over it. 
 But we've given up things... or had them taken from us. 
 For some, it's what we were born to. 
 Where you taking me?! 
 Doctor says he's got the pox. 
 Take me back! 
 We can't keep him inside. 
 Get his legs. 
 Niggers! 
 Nothing but niggers! 
 Easy. 
 They got no right to be here! 
 Oh, quiet! 
 Okay. Easy. Easy. Easy, sir! 
 Get your damn, dirty hands off of me! 
 Easy! 
 You need to be here, sir. 
 In the black hell?! 
 I want to go back to the white people hospital! 
 Sir. My name's Charlotte Jenkins, and here's how this goes. 
 Those who do as we say try to get better. 
 They end up walking out that way, mostly. 
 Those kicking up a fuss get sicker. 
 End up being carried out back and put in the ground. 
 So lie there now, Mister, and figure out which way you want to go. 
 Or else I just may have to decide for you. 
 Nurse, do you have a moment? 
 Good morning, Sister. Good morning. 
 You look as if you spent the night doing ungodly things. 
 Denied my usual company, I sought camaraderie at the City Hotel. 
 My, my. I would have thought that den of inequity beneath you. 
 That den offers refuge. 
 By your breath, I'd say the refuge was found in a bottle of whiskey. 
 Liquor lubricates my unending lessons in human physiology. 
 I'm only trying to meet your expectations. 
 Dr. Hale, a Confederate boy was brought in along with some Union wounded. 
 Could I prevail upon you to examine him? 
 Certainly, Miss Green. 
 I'm likely to find more amiability with the enemy. 
 Excuse me, Miss. 
 I have a message from Miss Dix for a Major McBurney. 
 I will see that he gets it. 
 Miss, it's urgent business related to a nurse here. 
 I'm supposed to-- 
 Mcburney : Superb. We are in perfect accord. 
 She has agreed with your choice for a new head nurse? 
 Hmm? No, nothing like that. 
 Miss Dix has dispatched an escort to take her away. 
 To take who away, sir? 
 Miss Phinney. 
 Better she die at home than here, where she might cause so much more damage. 
 By spreading her disease, I mean. 
 Miss Phinney's on the mend, I believe, and of some value here. 
 The calipers do not lie, Miss Hastings. 
 Her brain is poorly shaped... asymmetrical with a bloated sense of amativeness. 
 Do you know what amativeness is? 
 It means her organ is overly attuned to love. 
 That...  [Calipers thud] is a weakness. 
 Which brings me to my next subject... that malcontent Foster. 
 [Knocks] 
 Sir? 
 Ah, Captain. So prompt. You continue to delight. 
 Yes, well, uh, there is something I wish to address with you. 
 And I with you. 
 Yes, well, shall I... go first? 
 You go first. Proceed. 
 [Clears throat] 
 My concern for a patient prompted certain words and actions for which I now feel the need to apologize. 
 No mere patient. Our own dear Miss Phinney. 
 Rest assured, it was all well within my understanding. 
 Good. 
 Then perhaps we can speak of Miss Phinney's care. 
 I've recently read the findings of Dr. William... Budd... on the... contagion of typhoid fever. 
 Precautions can be achieved with minimal disruption. 
 Precautions? Interesting. 
 Now, General Schnaetzle of General Pope's army, encamped nearby awaiting orders to move on the enemy, has fallen ill. 
 Duty precludes him coming to us. 
 I'd like you to go provide treatment. 
 Miss Hastings will accompany you. 
 I-I may be required by-- 
 Miss Hastings? 
 My most brilliant doctor and my finest nurse. 
 The general will feel well tended to. 
 And tomorrow, we will discuss Miss Phinney's care. 
 Now, as the Russians say, "bystro, bystro." 
 It means "quickly." 
 Miss Hastings. 
 Do not return before dark. 
 By then the deed will be done. 
 It's all for the best. 
 I'll be back before nightfall. 
 Tell her I'll come by then. 
 [Door creaks] 
 Hale : Peritonitis. He won't make it through the night. 
 Someone should inform him. 
 You mean... 
 I'm to tell him? 
 It would be more acceptable coming from someone in sympathy with his cause. 
 Are you sure he'll die? 
 Yes. 
 But I hope I'm wrong. 
 Oh. Drifted off. 
 What'd the doc say? 
 He, uh... 
 He said he has hope. 
 [Sighing] 
 Emma : At times like this, it is important that preparations be made. 
 No. No, that's terrible. 
 Corporal, your condition offers scant promise for recovery, so... 
 You were at prayer? 
 No. 
 I needed a moment of my own. 
 And I was hoping to find you. 
 I've been tasked with a duty that... 
 I am unsure how to accomplish. 
 What sort of duty? 
 Telling a boy he's about to die. 
 I steel myself. 
 I have words ready, but then... when I look at him... 
 I feel a dread as I have never known. 
 Let's see him together. 
 [Bell ringing] 
 Got your horse over here. All watered and fed. 
 So, you're staying on with us, I hear? 
 I would not pry as to the reasons. 
 Some things just have to be. 
 Prepared for our journey? 
 Yes. 
 Let's make haste. We must be back before dark. 
 Not too fast now.I  have a capricious stomach. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 Where'd you get the blue jacket? 
 One of our lodges. 
 He won't miss it? 
 I don't expect so. 
 I can't wait to get back out there. 
 I can do some good. 
 You feel all right, Alice? 
 Fitful sleep. 
 This is an act of valor. 
 Valor of a true hero. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Halt! 
 Captain. 
 Corporal. 
 Where you journey, sir? 
 My purpose? 
 It's required that I ask, Captain. 
 When an officer and a lady enjoy an afternoon ride, is it not impolite to inquire as to their purpose? 
 Indeed it is, Miss. Indeed it is. 
 I still need the password. 
 The password. 
 Persimmon. 
 [Horse snorts] 
 Anne : Would you slow down a tad? 
 The bounce of the horse, bumps in the road. 
 My stomach. 
 You are concerned for Miss Phinney? 
 Perhaps the hospital is not the best environment for her to recuperate. 
 It is sometimes beneficial to remove the typhoid patient to a more pristine environment. 
 Remove Miss Phinney, you mean? 
 For her own recovery. 
 No. [Clears throat] 
 No, Miss Phinney is best cared for by us, at our hospital. 
 Typhoid was one of the first calamities I faced. 
 In the Crimea. 
 I nursed a man all the way from the brink of death. 
 He was able to return to the battle, valiantly. 
 Two weeks later, he was dead. 
 "Made weak by... fear"? 
 What was it? 
 "Time and fate." 
 It's "Ulysses" by Alfred Lord Tennyson, the poem Miss Phinney's father recited. 
 Tennyson? Really? 
 "Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will." 
 "Ulysses." 
 [Laughs] Yes. 
 Yes, thank you, Miss Hastings. 
 Now, if you will, a tad slower? 
 [Sighs] 
 "'Tis not too late to seek a newer world." 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 "Though much is taken, much abides... 
 And though... we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are. 
 One equal temper of heroic hearts..." Are you here for Miss Dix? [French accent] Major McBurney? I'm Lisette Beaufort. I believe you received the letter from Dr. Maynard. Oh, yes. I apologize. I was expecting... You're the artist. [Chuckles] An illustrator. Many would argue that is  not  an artist. Your work serves an anatomical reference. Art serving science. I call that art of the highest order. You are too kind, Major. Are you a believer in  la phrenologie? Yes. Yes, I am. I did some sketches for Jean Pierre Flourens at the College de France. Do you know him? Well, he was-- How to say-- skeptical about the scientific basis of Gall's theories. But who knows? The brain,  c'est mysterieuse. Yes, well, Dr. Maynard wrote that you'd be in Alexandria for a number of weeks. Indeed. I would like to sketch some of your patients. I will try not to  déranger-- D isturb you. [Mary screams] Matron Brannon : You mustn't be here like this! You must return to your room! Stop. Stop! Miss Phinney, calm yourself. Nurse Mary. I saw him. He was walking down the hall. Miss Phinney. He was walking down the hall.I  could hear his voice. To your room! I saw him. He was walking down the hall. I could hear his voice! I saw-- Who did you see, Miss? My father. Tell me about him while we go back to your room. It's too cold out here to be dressed like that. Who are you? Lisette. I'm new to this place. Won't you acquaint me? Dennis, I'm Chaplain Hopkins. Uh-oh. I know what it means when they bring the holy man. Sorry. I tried to tell you earlier. Don't be. I saw you. Your eyes spoke softer than your words. I'd like to learn more about you, son. Your likes and interests. So you can speak for me when I'm gone? Can you praise the cause I'll have died for? Pray for God-sent victory over your own? I can praise the man who dies for what he believes. [Inhales sharply]D on't want it. Don't need it. You do me a disservice, son. Better my death go unsung than be eulogized by the enemy. Corporal, I will find a preacher to your likin'. I figured you for one of us. [Clears throat] [Thunder rumbles] Pinkerton : Mr. Green... Who the hell is this? Wait by the horses. And you would be? I work for General McClellan. Had the pleasure of meeting your daughters as part of an investigation. Investigation into what? The attempted murder of a steward at the hospital. We believe that the assailant may be involved in bigger plans. I cannot say I know him. Perhaps it's a poor likeness. No, it's quite good. I met the man. Oh. So you let him slip away? Saw him with your daughters. What are you implying, sir? That a father might know a man keeping company with his daughters. Are you trying to provoke offense? No, sir. Never that. What did you say your name was? I didn't, but it's Pinkerton. Yes, sir. That  Pinkerton. "Made weak by time and fate but strong in will." A wonderful poem. I read it in school. I prefer the "Charge of the Light Brigade." "When can their glory fade? O, the wild charge they made!" Well, here we are. [Laughter and indistinct conversations] Or a good sonnet. [Cheerful music plays] [Laughter] Foster : General Schnaetzle, Captain Foster from the Mansion House Hospital. [German accent]W hy is this lady present? Uh, Nurse Hastings will assist me. General, please feel no discomfort. I served with the British military in the Crimea. My condition is of a male derivation. I have only ever nursed men, sir. No need to worry. If you could speak of your symptoms, General. I [Sighs] I have pain upon passing water. Pain here? No, no. Further down. Do not touch. I will point. Ah. Can you lower your trousers? Have you noted any discharge? Discharge? The meatus is inflamed. Signs of discharge are evident. You have gonorrhea, sir. The boys call it "gleep" or "clap." It's these dirty whores that follow us around. No fault of my own. The treatment involves introduction of a small catheter. Are-- A-Are you certain this is safe? Absolutely. The catheter was in fact invented by Benjamin Franklin for use on his brother. Once inserted, the urethra is flooded with a silver nitrate solution to kill the infection. You might wish to advise your men not to be alarmed should you cry out. It can be quite painful. Captain, this is man's business.I  demand you do this on your own. Breathe. Ohh. Oh! Aah. Aaaaaah! [Gunshots, cannon fire in distance] Whoa. Place looks abandoned. We'll stay here until the gunfire subsides. We should keep going. Doesn't serve anybody's purpose if we get ourselves killed. [Door opens] Frank. Came off the road seeking shelter. There were gunshots in the woods. Began before dawn. My wife, Grace, and our boy, Joshua. I am Solomon. Alexander Kimbel. This is my sister-in-law, Miss Martha Banks. [Baby fusses] Thy horse and carriage are best hidden in the barn. Soldiers are given to theft. Most obliged. 
 
 [Horse neighs] [Gunshots in distance] Grace : Thou need not fear. They have already come, taken from our larder, and gone. The Yankees did? Our men? From both sides. [Door opens] Solomon asked me to bring this in. Over there, if you please. Thy sister's husband has not yet been called to serve? I'm not much for fighting, ma'am. But our fear of it drives our prayers for victory. Quakers see no victory in conflict. We pray only to end the killing. Slavery is an evil, but more evil is the taking of life. Someone loved like this child is loved, taken forever from those who have loved them. Do you believe God punishes them? Punishes who? Those who kill, cause life to be taken. Even the fallen are children of God. There is no child the Holy Father cannot forgive. [Chuckles] [Baby cries] "Whore" is such an unkind word. [Woman laughs] Wielded in the most injurious ways. To him, they are the whores. To me, women trying to survive. Off we go. Time we move on, Miss Hastings. Oh, no. Mustn't leave him like that. Please, we are due back. How old is this dressing? Can't rightly recall, Miss. You must keep it clean. Looks suppurated. Indeed. But localized still. Do you want to lose a limb, soldier? [Cork pops] Or even expire? You must maintain a sanitary field. If you have no one to dress it for you, you must do it yourself. Or have your friend here do it. I will be back again to check on you. You intend to come back here? No, but fear makes them vigilant. Well, well. Quite good, Miss Hastings. N-Now, may we? Another moment, please. Mary : My father gave me fortitude when I was sick as a child. He died soon after I married. I'm sorry if I alarmed you. Why do you do this, sketch me? It is my work. And my habit. [Chuckles] You take care of people. I draw them. You have a husband at war? No. I'm widowed. It's been... well, quite a while now. Or do you have an amour? [Chuckles] Forgive me. I am too inquisitive. Painters are very aware of color. For example, your cheeks just turned pink. It's complicated. It's not a doctor. Oh, no. Pauvre. I once knew a doctor who could say precisely what I felt by the pulse of a single vein. He sounds most observant. He came to Salpetriere to be a surgeon. Well, they all come for that. But more than the skill with his hands, his greatest gift was his mind. Diagnostique...  seeing subtle signs of malady. His treatment was very imaginative. Did you love him? Do you love yours? [Door opens] Miss Mary, I'm sorry. I've... been told to prepare you for travel. Travel? No, I-I'm to remain here. Major McBurney ordered it. What? No! You... You tell him I want to see him immediately. I'm not going anywhere. You tell him! [Breathes deeply] Oh, there's granddaddy right over there. Hi, Grandpa. Hi, little one. Have you brung me a treat? Topsy, any biscuits for me? Come on. Didn't your mammy teach you about being generous? Leave her be now! Leave her be. Give me some of those! Keep your hands off her! [Clatter] [Grunting] Hey! [Flesh rends] [Screaming] No, no, no! Sit down. Sit down. [Moaning loudly] Come on. Help hold him down. Woman : Get some help! [Yelling] Artery's intact. He must have poked through a vein. Go get a doctor out here. Grab that sheet. Tear it in strips. How do you know what to do? I just do. Aah! I don't want no nigger hands in me! Mother. What are you doing here? I received your message about needing a pastor. I didn't mean for you to come. I've summoned Reverend Burwell. Now, where is this sick boy? Corporal, this is my mother. I've brought you some nice cakes. I have no appetite, ma'am. The Reverend Maurice Burwell, a believer in our cause, is on his way. Perhaps some news of our victories will help invigorate you. Forrest has beaten them in Murfreesboro. We've got the Yankees on the run down in Tennessee. I'll die with a victory prayer... on my lips. We shall pray for it together. Three souls bound by the glory of this cause. [Man coughing] [Sighs] Nothing here to suture with. So we'll have to do it a different way. Here, hold this. Aah! Hold him firm. Don't let him flop around. No! No! No! No! Aah. [Crying] No! No. Wha-- No! No, no, no. This is gonna hurt, sir. No, no, no. No! No! No, no, no. No, no. No! Good. No! No! No, no, please. [Sizzling] Aah! Good Lord. [Screams] Samuel! Wha-- Femoral vein was punctured, sir. He was losing too much blood. You cauterized it? Yes. Charcoal on his burned flesh? [Crying] That nigger tried to kill me. A poultice would have been better, but there was no time. The charcoal stanches the blood, fights against infection. So, you knew this was a vein, then? Yes, sir. Femoral. Femoral, and not the, um-- Popliteal artery? Yeah, that... that one. How did you... How did you know that? An even flow. No pulse like there'd be with an artery. Charlotte : He was trying to save him, Doctor. You can't be angry at him. Clean him up. Come see me. [Baby fussing] Suppose  he  thinks of death? They tried. Baltimore, now there's rumors again in Alexandria. They give me that in town. Funny-looking fella. I see him as a lost soul. It's a bad thing he did, but even this man can be forgiven if he stands before God and repents. [Gunshots in distance] It's getting farther off, I think. But safest for thee is to remain with us a short while longer. Frank : That farmer knows who I am. He has the flier with my face on it, a picture of Abe on the wall,  and  I found a gun. You're just nervous, Frank. A Union Army issue Colt pistol. It's for protection or hunting. Their sympathies are  not  with ours. They pray only for peace. They favor neither side. What if you're wrong? What if they turn me in? Maybe they think that'd be an act of peace. They wouldn't. There's a reward, Alice. These people are poor as church mice. He doesn't know. Dinner's ready. No need. Thank you. We'd best prepare our departure. I-I'd suggest waiting until tomorrow. For thy safety. I'll go hitch up our wagon. [Door closes] Hon, they need that. Why'd you take it? If they tell that I was here, people will be looking for us. [Sniffs] We'd both end up hanged. You're right. Let's go. They don't need the gun. But... leaving them alive means that we get caught. Wait here. No, Frank. Frank... don't. They're peaceful people. They have a baby. Frank. Frank, please. [Suspenseful music plays] Oh, God. [Door closes] [Horse neighs] Oh, please, God. No, no. [Wind whistles] Not them, not like this. [Thunder rumbles, horse neighs] [Crying] [Baby cooing] [Sighs] [Sniffles] [Sighs] It wasn't right to take their gun. These folks were good to us. Foster : Your various delays have made us late already. It would be inhumane not to let the horse rest. I am still hopeful to return before nightfall. I promised. I saw this at the sutler's tent. I thought you might want it. Tennyson. Well... that's kind of you. Miss Phinney has, at times, expressed concern you felt enmity towards her. But I am sure she will be touched by the gift. I didn't last long, you know. With Miss Nightingale in Scutari. The boy I told you about who got better only to be killed, I loved him. I fell in love with him while sitting vigil. And when he died, I could not hide my sorrow. Miss Nightingale, she knew. She saw my secret. And she told me to go. I am sorry, Miss Hastings. And I am sorry if I've been impatie-- She's being sent home. You must ride hard. If not, she won't be there when you return. I was told... promised by Dr. Foster that I would be treated here. This is in your own best interest. No, it is not! And you must understand that typhoid threatens patients and staff. Is he aware of this? Even Miss Dix agrees. Does he know?! Miss Green, please inform Miss Dix's envoy that Miss Phinney is ready to go. No, I am  not  ready to go. Dr. Foster will be back soon. I'm not asking! Tell the lady we're ready. Major, please, don't... Miss Phinney. Don't send me away. Please. Please. Please. Please. You heard me, Miss Green. Now. [Mary crying] Foster : Hyah! Hyah! Does Dr. Foster know? Tell him I said goodbye. May God make you well, Nurse Mary. [Door opens, closes] What will you do? Mrs. Fairfax has a cottage nearby. I'll spend the night there. She said she'd fix it with Mother. [Indistinct conversation] Those are our boys over there. I meant to give you this... after Tom died. I couldn't do it then, but... you should know that he was thinking of you when he went. Those Quakers got me wondering-- What if none of this is what God wants? Why would he? It's harder and harder to see any good coming from it. And I'm tired... of all the killing. Be safe, little sister. ♪♪ [Dog barking in distance] [Knocks] Enter. [Cork pops] [Door closes] I know I shouldn't have laid hands on that man, but he was in peril. You have hidden abilities, it seems. You've studied. Are you familiar with these? Some. Yes, sir. [Liquid pours] I once read Latin. Caesar and Tacitus. I was never a great student, but whatever I acquired, it is now gone, forgotten, along with a good deal of anatomy. I... uh, I'm soon faced with an examination wherein that knowledge would be of great importance. You have the right books, sir. Yes, I've tried on my own to memorize, but, um... Well, I f--I  feel I would fare better if someone were to act as tutor. You're thinking I could tutor you? Shh. On the quiet. I could offer a tangible expression of my gratitude. [Chuckles] Here I thought you called me in for a wood shedding. [Laughs] [Sighs] Pinkerton : Yes, well, the Peninsula didn't go quite as planned. No, I imagine not. Jimmy! Remember Mr. Pinkerton? Twice in one day. What a surprise. The pleasure's mine, I'm sure. Apparently, Jimmy, Captain Van der Berg, who was staying in the guest room upstairs, well, he-- he failed to report for duty. Did he? I saw him just yesterday. Desertion is not uncommon among enlisted men, but an officer... Needless to say, there's some perplexity. [Taps cane] Strange coincidence, you having two separate matters to discuss with us on the very same day. Yes, it is, isn't it? At least, I  hope  it is. [Laughs] [Chuckles] Might I see his room? Our girl can take you up. I'd... prefer to review it on my own. That's quite a lump you've got. I was hit by some lumber. Furniture can be a dangerous business. Where's Mother? With Emma. Trouble over a rebel patient. Chaplain Hopkins, this is Reverend Burwell. How do you do, sir? I have comforted this brave young man forced to face his final hour among the enemy. I'm glad he had you to guide him. Shall we proceed with the eulogy? [Gas hissing] [Suspenseful music plays] The noble struggle in which Dennis Ray Bryant has fallen was sanctioned by God Almighty. "God shall enlarge Japeth and Canaan shall be his servant." Thus, in Genesis 9, God decrees the dark-skinned sons of Ham to bondage. Dennis Ray Bryant died defending the Bible's holy word against those who would defy it and sin against God. We  are the army of God. [Scattered agreement] God's warriors uphold His word, keeping the sons of Ham in bondage. I lost my leg serving God's law! Scripture proves your loss was not for His will! This can't go on. Your fight is both unworthy and unholy. Reverend, please. Our cause alone is validated by the word of God. You are wrong, sir. Matthew 7, the words of Jesus. "Whatsoever ye would that man should do to you, do ye even so to them. For this is the law." I was speaking for the fallen hero. As you would do to others, must be as is done to you. Would you have yourself made a slave, sir? You dare to challenge me? What right have you to interrupt this eulogy? To falsely sanctify the abomination of slavery with holy scripture! Mother, by what right are wounded shamed for what they believe in? It is wrong, sir! And what you believe as well? Have you fallen so far from this family, Emma? [Indistinct talking, whistle blows] Chaplain Hopkins, this is Mrs. Everett, Corporal Bryant's aunt. I've come too late. Chaplain Hopkins : My sympathies for your sadness, ma'am. This is Reverend Burwell. My deepest condolences. Oh, Denny. [Voice breaking]W hat did they do to you? [Crying] In her grief is found our purpose... to comfort, not to confront. [Crickets chirping] Charlotte : Doctor reprimand you? No. [Chuckles] He wants me to tutor him. Tutor him? For an exam. He'll even pay me. Figures. Now he won't have to reveal to an "equal" what he doesn't know. You're a hard case, Charlotte. Schooled by masters. 'Course, to me, they were "massa." [Water dripping] How long has it been since you escaped? October, 1853. I ran for days... weeks. I didn't know where I was going. Hiding, hurting, hoping. Till someone told me about a woman that wanted to help make people free. They called her "Moses." That's how I found Miss Tubman. Taught me what it meant to give. No husband for you? I never desired motherhood. A blessing, I'm sure it is, but I could never bear the thought of a child of mine being sold or put in chains. You almost done? I need the soap. [Water dripping] [Horse neighs] Foster : Easy. Whoa. Dr. Foster. Mary... Where is she? [Train whistle blowing, indistinct conversations] Mary? Mary! Sir-- Step aside. She's my patient. I'm here. I'm right here. She's feverish. Get a moist cloth. Her ship's leaving soon. I don't give a damn about the ship. Bring her something. I thought I might not see you. If I'd known, I never would have left. Look. Miss Hastings found the poem. It's called "Ulysses." The one your father recited. Woman : Sir, we must board now. "That which we are, we are." "One equal temper... of heroic hearts made weak by--" "Time and fate. But strong in will to strive, to seek, to find--" "And not to yield." Will he be there? My father, will he be waiting? Will he be waiting? I shall see you before long. ♪♪ [Bell dinging] Dr. Foster : This great, big war... So many hospitals and you show up at this one? I see you two have been previously acquainted. Samuel plans to become a doctor himself one day. You may yet save many lives. Yes, we may. Your work is at the bedside, Chaplain. Not in the battlefield. Emma Green : You're not going out there. They'll shoot you! These people are marked for retribuition. They shall get what they deserve. Your own brother is on this list!
