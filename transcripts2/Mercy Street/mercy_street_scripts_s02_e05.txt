 It's the medical exam. Apparently you never took it. 
 We shall attribute these findings to Dr. Samuel Diggs. 
 I see you've been acquainted. 
 She wanted you to have this. 
 Is this merely a ploy to obtain a medical deferment? 
 Do you know how proud I am that you're facing up to your duty? 
 My brother, he is of the mind that I did not need to amputate his leg. 
 Strange coincidence, you having two matters to discuss with us. 
 My father has a strongbox in his study. 
 I took the money. 
 Mr. Secretary, the British envoy will be in my home. 
 I seek permission to lobby him. 
 Sorry, Mr. Green. 
 You cannot stay. 
 ♪ 
 Man : Fire! 
 [Cannon fire, gunshots] 
 [Men shouting] 
 Man : You rebel b*st*rd! 
 [Ordnance whistling] 
 [Screaming] 
 Foster : Soldier, can you tell me where you are? 
 Hospital. 
 Very good. Can you tell me your name? 
 No, sir. 
 Your regiment? 
 Regiment? 
 Who are you fighting with? 
 Very well, son. Rest. 
 Lisette : He fights for every breath. 
 Whoever patched him up did a hasty job of it. 
 We'll need to reopen the wounds, find the obstruction before he suffocates. 
 It's bad enough he knows nothing of himself. 
 Must he also be the subject of such morbid interest? 
 You brought him in? 
 Found him at Ox Hill. 
 Half the company marched right over him before we caught his eyes moving. 
 Chantilly-- that was 10 days ago. 
 Doctors held him at the field hospital till he was strong enough to make the trip here. 
 The doctors removed his uniform? 
 No, sir. 
 Found him in his top shirt and drawers. 
 Rebs must have picked him clean. 
 Or Union men. 
 Is it not possible that this poor boy is a Confederate? 
 Father, I have urgent business to attend to. 
 Your business is our business, and presently, our business is here. 
 He's expecting to meet us all. 
 This is how you present yourself to an envoy of the British government? 
 I'm due at the hospital, Mother. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'll change if you like. 
 That is a two-hour proposition at best. 
 His lordship will be down any minute. 
 Does a duke require a curtsey? 
 Not a duke, darling. The son of a duke. 
 Then why must we call him lord? 
 It's very confusing. 
 The man came with more trunks than a herd of elephants. 
 How long is he staying? 
 Only a week. 
 We have to share rooms for a week? 
 With her snoring? 
 Well, at least my nose doesn't whistle. 
 C sharp minor all night long. 
 You could tune a piano by it. 
 And you could benefit from some watching over. 
 Indeed. 
 We'll discuss the money missing from my strongbox another time. 
 You think-- 
 I would never steal from my own family. 
 Good morning, Lord Edward. 
 [Clears throat] 
 On behalf of my wife and our children, I welcome you to our home. 
 Most kind. 
 And on behalf of the queen, I am grateful for your hospitality. 
 Breakfast awaits in the dining room. 
 About our talk last evening... 
 Uh, arranging a meeting with your minister at Washington City. 
 Ah, yes, yes, yes. 
 Well, perhaps we could discuss it after I've taken in some action. 
 Tell me, how far is the war from here? 
 I should like to see some of it. 
 I'm afraid there's currently no fighting to be observed. 
 Hm. 
 Well, apparently, I came to the wrong place, then, didn't I? 
 I'll take my tea with milk, please, girl. 
 Oh, Your Lordship, you must forgive our eldest daughter's appearance. 
 She volunteers with the wounded. 
 Perhaps you would like a tour of a proper Army Hospital? 
 Well, I suppose, if there's no war to be seen, then, uh... 
 Well, then a few casualties might be the next best thing, hmm? 
 Show me your wounded, huh? 
 [Chuckles] 
 It appears to be a telegram, sir, from a Colonel Ipson. 
 McBurney : Ah, dear old Ipso. An old friend. 
 What does he want? 
 It states that he will be arriving today. 
 An issue with his toe, sir. 
 He fails to mention which one but fears it must come off. 
 Aha! 
 What do you see, Miss Hastings? 
 It appears to be a flea, sir? 
 Indeed, it is. 
 But it is not the one that bit me. 
 Terribly sorry, sir. 
 [Sighs] 
 Colonel Ipson's toe, sir? 
 Yes. Right. 
 I would be most appreciative if you would personally oversee his care. 
 It would be my great, great honor, Major, to look after your dear friend. 
 And afterward, we will discuss the future of your term as head nurse. 
 Thank you, sir. I will be doubly sure to-- 
 Don't muck it up. 
 Yes, sir. 
 That is to say, no, sir. 
 Good day, sir. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Charlotte : Major McBurney closed the school. 
 He says I encourage rebellion. 
 For teaching runaways to tell time? 
 I might have made small mention of a certain slave uprising in Haiti. 
 You thought he wouldn't find out? 
 You say that like I was wrong. 
 Miss Charlotte, there is a way of doing things around here. 
 Two ways, in fact-- one for them and another for us. 
 Some of them are dying for us. 
 I know that is not how you see it. 
 What I see or don't see makes no difference. 
 Nothing's gonna change for us until the killing is done. 
 I did not come here to sit quiet. 
 I am behind on my work. 
 Yes, sir. 
 No, sir. 
 Yes, sir, no, sir, yes, sir, no, sir! 
 We have to make a change for ourselves, or when this killing is done, all we're gonna do is change hands. 
 I fear what dark sin I may have committed. 
 You wish to make a confession? 
 I know not what I've done, but surely it was vile. 
 Why else would God take me from myself? 
 Your memory is lost, but your soul is intact. 
 God is not vengeful. 
 Then why has he done it? 
 I... 
 I-I cannot explain it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Forgive me, Chaplain. 
 I overheard you speaking with that poor boy. 
 If there's something-- anything I can do, I-- 
 Pardon me. 
 The most luxurious hotel in all of Alexandria. 
 Prior to the war, of course. 
 Note the finest English wallpaper. 
 Oh, yes. 
 William Woollams and Company. 
 Out of London. 
 The patt-- 
 The pattern was a gift for our wedding. 
 And, uh, this is the grand ballroom, where every New Year's, we hosted the... most elegant-- 
 Pardon my asking, have you any amputations we might observe? 
 I hear you people have them down to two minutes a limb. 
 None today, sadly. 
 Sorry. 
 Please, as you look for your loved ones, keep your voices to a whisper and take care not to interfere with the staff. 
 Excuse me, Matron. This came for you by post. 
 Uh, all right, this way. Follow me. 
 Is he in a mood? 
 [Gulps] 
 God, how do you drink that? 
 That man is positively off his chump. 
 Nonetheless, my desired commission may finally be at hand. 
 I am most happy for you. And now my own fate is at hand. 
 The surgeon's exam? 
 Yes, I have been summoned. The results are in. 
 Then is it beyond your control. 
 Yes, indeed, but-- but listen, Anne. 
 If-- If you could give a word on my behalf, it would-- it would not hurt my cause. 
 You are a gift physician, Byron. Hold fast to that belief. 
 No matter what he says, always, always remember-- 
 I wonder what sort of amputation it is-- an arm or a leg? 
 That's him. 
 Oh! Oh! So sorry. Oh, Lord Edward. 
 I heard rumors of your visit, and now I've gone and smashed straight into you. 
 Dreadful humiliation and a unique honor. 
 The victory that your great-great-great-grandfather achieved against the French at Fort Frontenac is a miracle for which all we English are eternally grateful. 
 Well, thank you, Miss, uh... 
 Hastings. Anne Hastings. 
 Yes. Well, a pleasure to have met you and-- 
 If, Lord Edward, you are ever missing home, any evening, such as, say, this one, consider me on call to make you a proper cup of tea. 
 I-I'm sorry, Miss Hastings. 
 Lord Edward must attend a reception this evening at Rush House. 
 In Washington City? 
 Indeed, indeed. Therefore, I couldn't-- 
 I have made that trip many times, if you should desire fellow countrymen to point out the local sights. 
 We've already agreed to go as his guests. 
 It's a full carriage. 
 [Clears throat] Perhaps another time, then. 
 Yes. 
 There are indeed many sights to be seen. 
 My results, sir? 
 No. I expect them this afternoon. 
 This is from the Surgeon General's Office. 
 It seems Hammond has taken a keen interest in an autopsy you performed. 
 Good news, then. 
 That remains to be seen, Doctor. 
 Tell me... why does Samuel Diggs' name appear on this report? 
 And why is it listed as Dr. Samuel Diggs? 
 Sir? 
 Did you allow a negro to lay his hands on a deceased white hero? 
 Certainly not. 
 That-- That would be-- 
 Career-ending, I would think. 
 I-I asked you to clean the dead room and to deliver the autopsy report to the clerk. 
 But, uh, you were, uh, confused and misunderstood my directive, and-- and, without my knowledge, you signed your own name to the report, which you recently learned to write at that school for contrabands. 
 Sir, the major will never believe such a story. 
 He already might. 
 Pending your corroboration, of course. 
 You told him? 
 And you want me to lie, play the dumb negro. 
 No one's suggesting that. 
 I never asked for any of this. 
 And I never said "dumb." 
 I was only trying to help you. 
 And I was only trying to show my gratitude. 
 Gratitude? 
 I'll be brought up on charges, thanks to you! 
 Samuel... 
 I am very sorry, indeed. 
 You did me a great service in a time of need. 
 But there's no reason both of us should go over the cliff for this. 
 And better you than I. 
 If you were honest, you would admit that I have much further to fall. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 I's thought I's done what Dr. Hale's told me to be done, but I's wrong, sir. 
 Will that explanation be sufficient, Dr. Hale? 
 [Gunshots] 
 60 rounds in 30 seconds. 
 Now you let us do the talking. 
 Mr. Morton, we'd like to take some of these guns off your hands. 
 Yeah, and I'd like to sell them to you... except we already got 54 on order from the Union. 
 We can make you a better deal. 
 You three? 
 That's right. 
 Now, the Union shows up in 10 suits and a bottomless check. 
 And bottomless bureaucracy. 
 You sell to us, we give you cash, up front. 
 We ain't got no up-front money. 
 Hush now. You had your turn. 
 What am I supposed to tell the feds? 
 Production's hard. Engineering must be precise. 
 The best lies are 99% true. 
 Bullen : Chaplain. 
 Chaplain! 
 Forgive me for saying, but I noticed you're not your usual self. 
 Have you? 
 Us fellow travelers on the path of the Lord must look out for each other. 
 You seem to me a man in a bare-knuckle scrap with his calling. 
 Do I? 
 Perhaps I could offer some wisdom from above. 
 Faith is firmly-ness in what we hope for and surely-ness in what we cannot see. 
 Book of John, 'bout halfway in. 
 It's Hebrews, I believe. 
 Six of one. 
 Might I offer you some wisdom? 
 Lord made ears for hearing, sir. 
 Beware of practicing righteousness in order to be seen, for you will have no reward from your Father. 
 [Whistling] 
 Poor boy can hardly speak but always says please and thank you. 
 If that doesn't mark him as a Southern man, nothing will. 
 A tattoo. 
 Can you make it out? 
 Looks to be a whale. 
 Perhaps he's a fisherman. 
 Surely from a Northern port town. 
 I would think that settles it. 
 A man's vocation scarcely defines what side he might fight for. 
 How is he doing? 
 While he sleeps, a debate rages as to his loyalty. 
 What do you suspect? Reb or Yank? 
 Does it make a difference from such a man, stolen from his family? 
 A wife, children perhaps? 
 One loss he'll not have to suffer. 
 Can't miss a family you don't know you have. 
 It's their loss I was thinking of. 
 Miss Green, have the patient moved to the surgical room. 
 Ipson : Oh. Stomped upon by Delilah. 
 My horse. [Chuckles] 
 Mashed it like a potato, she did. 
 What a naughty steed. 
 Oh, it wasn't her fault. I was shoeing her myself. 
 The head flew off the hammer, struck a pot with a bang, she reared up. 
 If anything's to blame, it's this damn watch. 
 Came to me after my father fell through the ice. 
 Came to him after his father met with a lightning strike. 
 That's quite a curse. 
 Perhaps you ought to part with it. 
 How could I? 
 If my mother were to find out, she'd murder me. 
 Then we shall keep our curses in perspective, as well. 
 [Both grunting] 
 You got a gift for cajolery, Green. 
 That fella didn't stand a chance. 
 Well, he was looking for the right offer. 
 If he didn't want to sell, he wouldn't have met with us. 
 And we got a load of rifles collecting cobwebs in here. 
 It's time we put them and this hell-maker to good use. 
 I say we start movin' it all south. 
 Bad idea. 
 One of these guns ain't gonna turn the tide of the war. 
 One's damn sure enough to send a message to them blue devils. 
 And when those blue devils find out we got it, they'll close that factory, and one is all we'll get. 
 He's right. 
 We build an arsenal, hidden here, where it's safe. 
 When we got enough to make a real difference, we move it all at once. 
 Them niggers of yours saw what we got here-- 
 I took care of them. 
 How? 
 I said I handled it, didn't I? 
 [Clucking] 
 Lord don't like a greedy man. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 S-So we got the money to pay for these eggs. 
 I don't see no money. 
 You know what they do to thievin' niggers, don't you? 
 Oh, you thinking about chasing it, boys? 
 Go right ahead. 
 Let me see a 7! 
 Man : Come on, bones! 
 7. That's four straight. I tell you, he's a blackleg. 
 What's your bluff, Bullen? 
 Divine providence, gentlemen. 
 When the Lord is on your side, you cannot lose. 
 Good for twice that much? 
 [Smooches] 
 Roll again. 
 Gentlemen, the Lord thanks you in advance for your generous tithe. 
 The money you are about to lose will feed the hungry and heal the infirmed. 
 Throw the damn bones. 
 Man : Come on, here we go. 
 [Dice rattle] 
 [Laughter] 
 Plank up, Bullen. 
 I promise. I'm good for it. 
 Come on, now. 
 You'd better be. 
 Or the only thing you'll be good for is a pine box. 
 You have until this time tomorrow. 
 [Laughter] 
 Shell fragments entered from the left side, passed through at a downward angle. 
 Extensive damage to the upper maxilla, mandible. 
 It's a miracle he can speak at all. 
 Miss Green, please be more frequent with the dry lint. 
 Yes, Doctor. 
 Too much saliva will be injurious to our patient. 
 Yes, Doctor. 
 [Clears throat] Look at that. 
 A fragment from the ramus has broken off and reset akimbo, constricting... the esophagus. 
 [Pencil scratching] 
 Mademoiselle Beaufort, this is a surgical theater, not an atelier. 
 Am I interfering? 
 That we are having this conversation is, by nature, an interference. 
 Kindly take your canvas and absquatulate. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I asked you to depart. 
 You asked me to absquatulate. I don't know what that means. 
 It means to depart. 
 Very well. I'll only need one moment. 
 Are you jesting? Is she jesting? 
 I couldn't say, Doctor. 
 Seen and unheard, if only you could be an inspiration to the others. 
 No need to mock the girl. 
 That's enough. 
 I command all women to vacate this room at once! 
 He doesn't mean me. 
 You as well, Miss Hastings. Out! 
 [Door opens] 
 You'll be asleep any moment. 
 [Watch ticking] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Afternoon, sir. 
 I'm here to see Mr. Green. 
 They both out, sir. 
 What time do you expect them? 
 Couldn't say, sir. 
 Shame. 
 We have some unfinished business. 
 Well, i-if you leave your name, I'll be sure to tell 'em you come calling. 
 Or you and I could have a chat. 
 [Violin playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Mother, do you suppose it's possible to die of boredom? 
 We'd have left you in your room if we thought the lock could hold you. 
 I did not steal that money. 
 Perhaps it was Belinda. 
 Do not deflect suspicion on others, darling. 
 It is unladylike. 
 [Sighs] 
 It did not go well? 
 It did not go at all. 
 I cannot secure an introduction to the minister. 
 It seems his lordship is intent on seeing action of one sort or another, as is the minister. 
 In one hour, we will be on our way back home. 
 I fear any hope we have of an alliance with the British is drawing to a close. 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 To help father with the British. 
 Two years at the Young Ladies Institute, my wiles will not be outdone by some Yankee slommack. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I fear we have unleashed a monster, my dear. 
 You don't know the half of it. 
 
 
 
 [Watch ticking] 
 You are late, Doctor. 
 My apologies. 
 I had other patients to attend to. 
 If only I were able to luxuriate in my great-great-great- grandfather's wealth and renown. 
 No need to be trivial. 
 Thank you for making the time. 
 The patient is prepared for surgery. 
 Please keep in mind that my future depends on the outcome, so please make it swift and painless. 
 Swift and painless? 
 Yes, swift and painless. 
 [Clicks tongue] Tricky, the little ones. 
 But everything seems to be in order. 
 Naturally. 
 I have attended to every detail myself. 
 Indeed, you have. 
 There's just one minor complication. 
 Minor? Really, Byron? 
 Must you be so coy? 
 The chloroform was administered 15 minutes ago. 
 This patient is soon to wake. 
 No, this patient is deceased. 
 Hm. Mm. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 [Whistling] 
 That clock is an heirloom, sir. 
 Miss Green don't much like folks' fingers on it. 
 Please, pick a seat. 
 Uh, Miss Green don't like the help sittin' on the furniture. 
 Miss Green has a lot of rules. 
 How long have you been with her? 
 Since I was born, sir. 
 We go back to Miss Green's mother's side. 
 A slave. 
 I's paid now, sir. 
 Do you know who I am? 
 No, sir. 
 My name is Pinkerton. I work for Mr. Lincoln. 
 Yes, that Lincoln. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you think of our president? 
 I don't know the man, sir. 
 You know he's fighting this war to end slavery. 
 That's what they say. 
 Some people want to kill him for it. 
 If that should happen, the next president might decide to make peace, send back the runaways. 
 Would you like that? 
 Go back the way things were? 
 No. Nor would I. 
 It's my job to make sure that doesn't happen. 
 Tell me... do you know this man? 
 Uh, no, sir. 
 I found it in a dresser upstairs. 
 Miss Emma don't like people lookin' around in her dresser, sir. 
 I never said it was her dresser. 
 Servants see everything, don't they? 
 Carry all those secrets to the grave. 
 It's a devotion I respect. 
 I have no intention of bringing grief upon the Greens. 
 I merely want to find this man. 
 And do you know why? 
 So that things don't go back the way they were. 
 I love these children, sir, like they's my own. 
 And I couldn't bear bringing no trouble on this family. 
 I know that. 
 I only want Stringfellow. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Mr. Green, I do so admire your audacity-- to be here, conducting diplomacy, all the while surrounded by the enemy. 
 I do not see these men as my enemy, Mr. Stuart. 
 We are merely estranged brethren. 
 To borrow from Mr. Lincoln, I only hope to restore unity to a house divided. 
 Oh. A magnanimous position, indeed. 
 But what now of the issue of slaves? 
 You know where my government stands. 
 Make its eventual end a condition of your support. 
 By degrees, of course. 
 It's a matter of autonomy. 
 And pride. Pride, Mister Green. 
 America never could stand being told what to do. 
 The whole bloody country was predicated upon it. 
 But do you mean to tell me that you will take up this matter with your government? 
 Respiration is normal. 
 Be sure the dressings remain fresh and-- 
 Continue with the dry lint, Doctor? 
 Indeed. 
 He is not to speak more than is necessary. 
 The sutures could open. 
 Same goes for chewing. 
 Will he require his meals through a gum catheter? 
 Yes. 
 Milk punch? 
 Precisely. 
 Initiative, self-reliance. 
 You are very suddenly coming into these qualities. 
 Thank you, Dr. Foster. 
 [Sighs] 
 I apologize for snapping earlier. 
 Though it is customary here in America to not interrupt a surgeon during a procedure. 
 How quickly the apology is withdrawn. 
 Then I am doubly sorry. 
 I was merely suggesting-- 
 You single me out, yet there were other nurses there-- 
 Whom I do not smell. 
 That also came out wrong. 
 We have a history, you and I. 
 I am constantly writing the next chapter, attempting to predict my future course. 
 Your perfume draws my mind to the question when my focus is required elsewhere. 
 You mean to say that you are uncertain about us? 
 It is amazing how hard you must work not to say what you mean. 
 Is your subject amongst these men? 
 He is. 
 You mean to say that... that is him? 
 It is how he may have looked. 
 Drawn from your imagination. 
 Along with precise observations of facial muscle and bone structure, such as I collected during your surgery. 
 What you call "the interruption." 
 You wish to identify him? 
 That is the hope. 
 Anne : The chloroform may have been impure. 
 The patient must have had a negative physiological response. 
 Clearly. 
 I'm so sorry, sir. 
 This was an unforeseen circumstance. 
 What you call circumstance I call woeful negligence. 
 Sir, in my many years as a nurse-- 
 A man hobbles in on a bad toe and leaves in a pine box? 
 You are not a nurse. You are an undertaker. 
 Your career is finished. 
 I meant to use that money for good, I did. 
 What's the matter, huh? The Lord sees all. 
 The Lord gaveth and the Lord tooketh, and now I must repenteth. 
 [Watch ticking] 
 The Lord giveth again? 
 Samuel, this is simply incredible. 
 Hinges at the ankle, can take a shoe. 
 Better than crutches. 
 With some practice, your brother could achieve a more natural step. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Well, I can't take all the credit. 
 Borrowed the design from a man called Hanger. 
 Said to be the first amputee of the war. 
 A soldier inventor? 
 And a reb at that. 
 Rebel-inspired. 
 Ezra will be pleased to hear it. 
 You've been in the shadows too long. 
 We must make your presence felt here. 
 Actually, Dr. Foster, I'll likely be heading back home soon. 
 Home? But why? 
 Time to move on. 
 [Singing in Gaelic] 
 As you look for your loved ones, please try not to disturb the patients. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Pardon me, Sister. 
 I have thus far been delicate in my attempt to speak with you. 
 Now I'll be direct. 
 I have a right to know why you ignore me. 
 Yes, Miss Green, you do. 
 When I was young, I caused the death of a boy... out of rage, vengeance...weakness. 
 I swore that I would never harm another soul as long as I breathed. 
 What happened at the river, it wasn't your fault. 
 I made a vow to God, which I broke because of... because of my weakness for you. 
 Is that what I am to you? A weakness? 
 [Knock on door] 
 Yes? 
 A moment. 
 Well? 
 [Sighs] 
 These arches, they protrude too far. 
 Thusly, the skin might be drawn too high around the eyes. 
 Making the face too wide. 
 Yes. I shall refine it. 
 I was thinking about the night we met. 
 [Sketchbook closes] 
 Dinner at Les Ambassadeurs, walking the Seine... vowing to cross every bridge before sunrise. 
 And how familiar we felt. 
 Yet hours before, you were unknown to me. 
 It was... 
 Unique. 
 Yes. 
 I'm sorry I did not appreciate it then. 
 Is that an apology or a confession? 
 Which would you prefer? 
 [Knock on door] 
 Excuse me, Dr. Foster. 
 Yes. 
 Major McBurney would like to see you. 
 Gentlemen. 
 Dr. Foster, I hold you, as executive officer, personally responsible for this debacle. 
 Sir, I wrote my name on that report. 
 If there is blame to be had, it rests on me-- 
 The fault is mine, sir. 
 Samuel faithfully assisted me in the procedure and, I might add, made the observation that led to its singular finding. 
 I-I thought it fitting he should receive some credit. 
 So if anyone is to blame-- 
 It is I. 
 Major, Dr. Hale and Samuel are protecting me. 
 I'm the one who altered the report. 
 But why? 
 For my own benefit, sir. And yours. 
 I fail to see how this falsehood benefits me in any way whatsoever. 
 Shall I elaborate? 
 By all means. 
 [Clears throat] 
 The report was a ruse, meant to bolster Mr. Diggs' standing in his application to medical college... where he has not only been accepted but where his keen intellect makes him a singularly valuable commodity to influential abolitionists willing to write influential letters on our behalf. 
 For me, a clerkship for my slow-witted nephew Percy onto the high court. 
 For you... a ticket out of this flea trap and back into the fight, where your talents may be more fruitfully applied. 
 [Chuckles] 
 A bit Machiavellian, no? 
 Well, Samuel, I hope you will make a good impression and reflect the confidence we all have in you. 
 I most certainly will, sir. 
 If... you agree to reopen the contraband school. 
 [Stammers] 
 I fail to see how the two are connected. 
 They're both charitable endeavors, sir, united only by the patronage of a bold, courageous leader. 
 I believe he means you, sir. 
 Very well, soon-to-be-doctor Diggs. 
 [Stammers] 
 Make us proud and all that. 
 Thank you, sir. I'll do my best. 
 Apparently, we are going to Medical College. 
 We? 
 Since I must make a trip home to deliver your leg to my brother, I shall accompany you. 
 Now all I have to do is find a school that will accept you. 
 Sir, I was wondering if you have received my-- 
 Passed with flying colors. 
 Hm! 
 That is-- That is most excellent-- 
 But I do not care for you, Dr. Hale. 
 And so I have requested your immediate transfer to Drum Barracks, a remote, dusty outpost in Santa Monica, California. 
 Santa-- Where is that, sir? 
 Think Hell, only drier. 
 You're going to the edge of the Earth, Dr. Hale. 
 To the edge of the Earth! 
 Ow. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Matron. Are you all right? 
 A letter from my son's commanding officer. 
 That's never good. 
 I've been carrying it around all day because I didn't have the courage to open it. 
 Would you? 
 "Dear Madam, it is with great sympathy I must report the death of your beloved son Lieutenant Declan Brannan, who fell heroically after leading his men into battle. 
 Surely no words can assuage your grief, yet I pray some solace may be found in the thanks of his fellow soldiers and of the republic he died to save." 
 I know my son. 
 Please give me the truth. 
 "Lieutenant Declan Brannan suffered a mortal injury..." 
 Ah... 
 "...after falling from a wagon while attempting to evade capture by Union guards." 
 "...after absconding from a supply depot with a large quantity of medicinal alcohol, by which, it is presumed... he become thoroughly intoxicated." 
 [Crying] 
 I'm so sorry, Matron. 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 Please, give us your flask. 
 Oh, Miss Hastings... 
 I see everything that happens in this hospital. 
 Everything. 
 [Cries] 
 Jane : It will be nice to have the house to ourselves, if only for a day. 
 The whole Green clan. 
 Welcome home. 
 What are you doing in my home at this hour? 
 Well, discussing the disappearance of Captain Van Der Berg. 
 Yes, curious thing. 
 A man disappears into thin air and no one has a clue? 
 The only curious thing is the rug-- the recently missing rug from the recently missing captain's room. 
 We had to dispose of it. 
 For what purpose? 
 Fleas. 
 Funny. 
 Your servant said it was mold. 
 Yes, Belinda had plenty to say. 
 We had quite a lengthy visit. 
 Either she is lying or you are, Mrs. Green. 
 Anyone care to explain the discrepancy? 
 You should know that silence, in this case, is as good as an admission of guilt. 
 If you've got your admission, then arrest us, or else get out of my house. 
 Only enough space in the saddle for myself. 
 Next time, I'll bring a wagon for the whole family. 
 Good night, dear. Thank you for the tea. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 You killed that Yankee in this house, didn't you?! 
 The man was a savage. 
 He attempted to violate your sister. 
 And you kept it secret? From me? 
 To protect you. 
 [Chuckles] Father's being polite. 
 We don't trust you. 
 Speaking of trust, should we really be having this conversation in front of her? 
 Oh, Belinda, how could you? 
 Maybe she wanted to get rid of us after stealing that money. 
 Oh, don't be ridiculous! 
 Tell the truth, Belinda. Did you take it? 
 I took the money. 
 I needed it to hire teamsters to help carry the wounded back from the field. 
 The field? What field? 
 The battlefield? 
 You went out there alone with soldiers-- 
 She was not alone! 
 She was with a man of God. 
 Well, well, if I'm not the black sheep, I hardly know what I'll be. 
 She meant well, and she returned safely, James, and that is what matters. 
 You knew of this and lied to me. 
 I did not want to worry you. 
 What do I possibly have to worry about? 
 One girl is a conniving spy, the other is a Union-loving thief! 
 I am not a thief! 
 Helping the wounded is God's work. 
 The next time God needs $500, tell him to ask! 
 $500? 
 I only took $30. 
 Why let all that money sit there when it can be put to good use? 
 [Scoffs] You stole from my business? 
 Your  business? 
 Who do you think's been running things? 
 It's my name on the building! 
 Maybe, but now, when people come to see Mr. Green, they're coming to see me. 
 Belinda, get my laudanum from upstairs. 
 Get it yourself. 
 I only ever tried to keep you people out of trouble. 
 But you all too good at bringing it on yourselves. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Anne : Santa Monica? 
 Apparently even more dreadful than it sounds. 
 I will not go quietly. 
 Nor would I. 
 So it's agreed? 
 We must destroy that madman before he destroys us. 
 [Brannan singing in Gaelic] 
 Matron Brannan? 
 Just a littler ditty I used to sing to my boy. 
 What do you need? 
 I would like a room. 
 But you already have a room, Miss Green, in your very large, very comfortable house. 
 Here. 
 I'd like a room here. 
 This is where I belong. 
 Your ma will miss you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Please step softly, as many of our patients are sleeping. 
 Ah! 
 [Crying] 
 You know this man? 
 My husband. 
 Where have you traveled from? 
 Our home, near Ox Hill. 
 We heard wounded crying out. 
 He left to bring them water. 
 I begged him to stay... 
 Your husband is not a soldier? 
 We are Quaker people. 
 Matthew 5:9 says... 
 "blessed are the peacemakers." 
 Solomon? 
 Solomon, I'm here. 
 I'm here, Solomon. 
 Darling... 
 Darling, I'm here. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 How did this happen? 
 McBurney had a change of heart. 
 Just like that? 
 Dr. Foster has a way with words. 
 You have him to thank for it. 
 I'll be sure of it. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I'm only glad that you are happy. 
 You are peculiar, Mr. Diggs. 
 In the whole time I've been here, I have not known you to smile. 
 Suppose I haven't had much to smile about... until now. 
 I have a confession. 
 I chose Mansion House because I knew you were here. 
 You suspected it, yes? 
 I'm glad you came, nonetheless. 
 Well, that's kind of you to say. 
 Though I'm not so sure that is how you feel. 
 I feel many things. 
 I will be leaving in the morning. 
 Didn't think to tell me sooner? 
 I have just decided. 
 You have not chosen your future course, so I must choose mine. 
 Would you like to come in? 
 For old times' sake? 
 She doesn't need to know. 
 I think it best if I didn't. 
 No more bridges to cross? 
 What happened between us... if things would have been different then, who knows what may have been? 
 Do not make the same mistake with her. 
 I wish you a safe journey home.
