 No. 
 Someone didn't.

 He seems to be in collapse. 
 Who'd have done such a thing? 
 A number of people come to mind. 
 The wound is deep, but the kidney seems to have been spared. 
 He's a good Catholic, he is. 
 You must save our dear Mr. Bullen. 
 The intestine might be nicked. 
 I've seen it with a bullet wound. 
 Well, fix it, then. 
 Yes, Dr. Hale, fix it. 
 Uh... 
 Well, we'd have to pull the intestine out, I think. 
 Pull it-- Pull it out of his body? 
 Yes, to find the cut and repair it. 
 And then we-- we put it back in and close him up. 
 Have you done that before? 
 [Bullen groans] 
 Yes, once. 
 Very well. 
 But not here. We need instruments and more light. 
 I'll fetch men with a stretcher. 
 Can he be revived? 
 Dr. Hale has seen far worse and lived to tell the tale. 
 I'm sure Hale has.

 Be a much more humane procedure with chloroform. 
 True, but if ever a man was deserving of additional agony...

 Who are you, sir? 
 Pinkerton, Intelligence Service. 
 Yes,  that  Pinkerton.

 Yes, yes, of course! The famed detective. 
 You know the one, Dr. Foster-- he never sleeps. 
 Isn't that so, Detective? You never sleep.

 I'm sorry, Frank. 
 There was urgent business here. I had to remain.

 Frank would have been with you. 
 I stayed because I was trying to help Father. 
 I don't see what that has to do with some scoundrels beating Frank.

 On the contrary, he faces fleeting death.

 Aha.

 I'm Miss Phinney. 
 I'm Charlotte Jenkins of the New England Freedmen's Society. 
 Miss Jenkins! 
 They told me you were coming, but they didn't say when. 
 It's wonderful to meet you. 
 This is Dr. Foster, our acting chief. 
 As of an hour ago. 
 After receiving missives from Miss Phinney, the Society dispatched me here with funding and supplies in order to help acclimate those making the transition to freedom. 
 You sent a missive? 
 My friends up North are hungry for information. 
 I described for them what is happening here. 
 It became apparent that help was needed. 
 So here I am. 
 Uh, what, precisely, do you do? 
 Educate, support, fortify. It's all there in the letter. 
 We are most happy to have you. 
 Well, you are free to move about among them doing your business. 
 Something more pressing has come to my attention. 
 You have the makings of an epidemic here. 
 Smallpox. 
 If something isn't done-- 
 Smallpox? 
 I know it has been a problem in Washington among the Negroes. 
 Not only Washington, sir, and not only the Negroes. 
 I'd like to establish a quarantine tent outside this hospital. 
 Bring the smallpox closer? 
 We'll isolate it to prevent spread. 
 We have seen typhoid. No smallpox yet. 
 When the disease comes-- 
 It is already here, sir. 
 I've seen signs of it within your own staff. 
 We do not treat Negro patients. 
 It is not a Negro disease, sir. 
 The depleted state in which freed people are kept allows the disease to find its hold among them, but it quickly spreads... to soldiers-- white people. 
 At which point, those who would blame the Negroes are quick to say, "See what the slaves bring? 
 See what freedom has wrought?" 
 I can get it started, sir. 
 The space out back, near the stable. 
 What I'm proposing, sir, it's in the interest of everyone.

 Uh, Chief, you must join me at the bedside of our good steward. 
 Pardon me. 
 As you seem to have your own resources, I will not prevent you. 
 It is remarkable. 
 He woke up, just like that. 
 But he remembers nothing? 
 No. 
 All he seems concerned with is making right with God. 
 Mr. Bullen? Our steward? 
 Yes, a Herculean task.

 And committed depraved acts... against animals.

 Blundell. 
 Odd man. 
 Sleeps till noon, sees patients late into night. 
 My, how fascinating! 
 I need some tubing, some needles, and a glass cup. 
 How intriguing. What does it do? 
 Foster : Transfers blood from a healthy person in order to compensate for exsanguination. 
 Blundell calls it a transfusion. 
 Oh, my. 
 Why me, Foster? 
 You're healthy. Got good veins. 
 [Gasps] 
 It is most bizarre. 
 Pulse is returning to normal. 
 You might save him yet, Dr. Hale. 
 Oh, there, there, O valiant one. 
 All right, back to work, everyone. 
 Give him some air. 
 Any word on your father? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 This Bullen matter has become quite a scandal, hasn't it? 
 Someone seems to want him dead rather badly. 
 I hear it has to do with a plot against the President. 
 A plot? 
 Yes, they suspect radical Confederates were using the dentist's office to plant a bomb. 
 Bullen might have foiled the plan, making the steward a hero of sorts-- an irony even God might smile at.

 The bedrolls can move over there. 
 Miss Jenkins, is there anything I can be of help with? 
 I have money for ointments and dressings, but it would be a great help were you to procure them. 
 Certainly. 
 You've been vaccinated, I presume? 
 Most of us working here have. 
 What's all this ruckus? 
 A smallpox quarantine, sir. 
 Smallpox? It's a nigger disease. 
 It is until it isn't. 
 God's will, they say. 
 You emancipate them and what happens? 
 Darkies ain't meant to be free. 
 Sir, if your work here is done, ride away. 
 Come on. Let's get your mom settled in here. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't you worry. In you go. 
 She's a force to be reckoned with, Miss Jenkins. 
 I wonder why no one has noticed this outbreak until now. 
 Any of our doctors, say? 
 Maybe 'cause nobody was looking. 
 [Knock on door, door opens] 
 Mountains of forms. 
 The new chief cannot arrive soon enough. 
 Did you hear what we did with Hale's blood? 
 It's quite the feat. 
 I doubt it's ever been tried here. 
 Let me ask... 
 You are a perceptive doctor with a highly trained eye. 
 Why did you not see what she saw, the spread of smallpox? 
 I'm in here, not out among them. 
 Yes, just as I thought. 
 Because you weren't looking. 
 Because I wasn't-- 
 There are desperately ill people out there, even a woman with child. What will become of them? 
 What I expressed was a reasoned medical approach, informed by the limited resources of this hospital. 
 It's what I don't like about this position-- difficult, even unseemly choices must be made. 
 Does she believe you when you talk like that? 
 Your wife, when you say one thing but mean another. 
 We are seeking a divorce, Eliza and I, if you must know. 
 I mustn't. 
 I have found an attorney in Sacramento. 
 No, I'm not talking about that. 
 Then what? 
 You hide. 
 From yourself, from everyone. 
 If those people were not Negroes, would you sit there so forcefully arguing the same reluctance? 
 Blaming a lack of resources? 
 Unseemly, indeed. 
 You are angry about something other than the quarantine. 
 I'm angry about who you are, who you pretend to be. 
 That is not what I mean. 
 I know what you mean. 
 [Sighs] 
 It was a mistaken exchange after a long, trying day. 
 A moment of weakness. 
 You beguiled me for a second. 
 I will not be beguiled anymore. 
 How could I have been such a fool?! 
 I tried to explain it, Ems. 
 All those people-- people I work with, care for-- you would have killed them all. 
 But I didn't. 
 In the end, I thought better of it. 
 Why? Why did I do that? 
 I don't care. I don't want to know. 
 Because of you. 
 It was for you I called it off, gave up on the plan, put myself in jeopardy, risked everything. 
 And that makes it all right? 
 No, I... 
 Now, I have a chance to be better. 
 I'm in the clear. 
 All I ever wanted was to defend our side. 
 You think of yourself as a hero. 
 You're no hero. 
 My father's a hero, sitting in jail for what he believes in, not killing people. 
 This is my father's house. 
 And I want you out of it by morning. 
 Man : Whoa! Whoa! 
 Whoa, there. 
 Anne : Grander than I expected. 
 Foppish, I'd say. 
 I didn't imagine him so young. 
 How old is he? 
 He's handsome. 
 Handsome enough. 
 Enough for what, Sister? 
 [Door opens] 
 Shouldn't you greet him, Matron? 
 Brannan : Oh! [Chuckles] 
 His emissaries made clear Major McBurney prefers to be left alone. 
 He'll remain behind closed doors assessing and asks not to be interrupted until he summons. 
 Sounds like a jovial sort. 
 [Woman coughing] 
 Mary? 
 I've decided to take your advice. 
 Pardon me, Doctor. 
 What advice was that? 
 On remaining here-- as a nurse. 
 Would you be so kind as to petition Dr. Foster on my behalf? 
 I feel that coming from you, it-- 
 Yes, you may have to do that yourself. 
 I suspect it will be better received coming from you. 
 Have you taken ill? 
 Only a cold. 
 Hazard of the work.

 Oh! Captain van der Berg, forgive me. 
 How clumsy. 
 Oh, let me-- let me help you, Miss Alice. 
 Have you heard the news? 
 The man of the house has returned. 
 Yes. 
 You will like my father. You remind me of him-- tall, handsome, passionate in your commitment. 
 To opposite sides, unfortunately. 
 Oh, well. Passion is passion. 
 Ah. 
 Our prayers have been answered. 
 That place... 
 I started feeling like I'd never get clean again. 
 It's all over now. 
 You're home. 
 Wish I knew how it came to be. 
 They said nothing to you? 
 Not a word. 
 Just put me in a Union wagon and... brought me back here. 
 Well... at last, they realized the folly of their ways. 
 Perhaps. 
 Or being rebuffed in Richmond, they know they must start looking towards conciliation. 
 A truce? 
 General Lee has McClellan on the run.

 This can't go on forever.

 Your timing is bad, Dr. Foster. 
 The contraband with child--

 Too late. 
 The baby was stillborn. The mother died. 
 Pardon me.
