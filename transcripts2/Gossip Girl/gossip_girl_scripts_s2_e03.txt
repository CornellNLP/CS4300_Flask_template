 Everything okay? No, actually, it's not, but I'm so glad I called you. 
 I really missed you this summer.

 You can take care of this with my help. 
 -And what would I have to do for you? -Oh, my effing god! I'm so sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to make it back tonight.

 Three Limit all physical activity. 
 That is, within reason. 
 I thought you wanted my help with this party you're hosting.

 But someone could walk in. 
 Dorota or-- so? didn't you see "atonement"? That scene in the library when they're discovered? Mm.

 no, blair. 
 That's not you. 
 It's not? You're a delicate little flower, nothing like that tart, Keira Knightley.

 You came all the way to brooklyn to invite me to a party for a school that I don't even go to? It was for nate, dear.

 You're not over blair. 
 Wh--come on. 
 this is your body's way of telling you. 
 I don't have a romantic bone in my body least of all that one. 
 But you do raise an interesting idea. 
 Clearly there's some sort of blockage. 
 Perhaps No, chuck. 
 One more go-around, just to clear the pipes. 
 You are not using blair as sexual drano. 
 I have to make myself presentable. 
 I have a party to attend. 
 By the way Congrats on you and humphrey. 
 Water always finds its own level. 
 I just think if we hemmed it and then got Rid of all that stuff by the collar, right? Yeah.

 I just--i feel like the dress is trying too hard, And this part is so '90s. 
 Interesting observation. 
 and who are you? Uh, I'm I'm jenny humphrey, the parsons intern. 
 Uh, I thought you were going home. 
 Laurel went to go meet you. 
 And I decided to come here. 
 You can, um, leave those and bring the rest of the bags to the apartment. 
 So now interns have opinions. 
 I have been gone a while. 
 Mrs. 
 Waldorf, I hope that you don't think that I was trying-- that you were telling the model that has to wear my design all the many, many things that are wrong with it? It's hot and late. 
 We'll finish your fitting tomorrow. 
 I'm--i'm so sorry. 
 That was completely, completely unprofessional, And I promise it will never happen again from me. 
 I s--i swear. 
 I know you won't. 
 Not here at least. 
 I need people around here that I can trust. 
 Clean out your station. 
 What? no. 
 No, please. 
 You can't-- oh, yes, please, I can, And if you are still hoping for a letter of recommendation, you won't argue. 
 Why is it so hot in here? Nate! I thought that was you. 
 a little warm for a run, isn't it? Yeah, you know, I was just, um, had some things to think about. 
 Will I see you at blair's tonight? Yeah. 
 uh, you headed down there now or what? No, no. 
 I promised the duchess I'd pick her up. 
 oh, your mother's coming. 
 Oh, yes.

 I always find them whispering in a corner. 
 It's a bit troubling, come to think of it. 
 Anyway, uh, I'll see you tonight. 
 thanks, man. 
 This is vanessa. 
 leave a message after the beep. 
 Hey, vanessa. 
 it's nate.

 I just want to shake him, like, I can handle it, you know? hey. 
 sorry. 
 
 
 
 I'm, uh, I'm ready. 
 So how was public opinion on the dan and serena front? Oh, well, it turns out most people think I'm an ass. 
 But a passionate minority hold I'm just an idiot. 
 So are you ready? uh, nate's running late. 
 I'll just--i'll meet you there. 
 Okay. 
 you sure? yeah. 
 Uh, you still positive you don't want me tagging along? Yeah. 
 No offense, dad, but I think you, Me and serena-- things are awkward enough. 
 well, it's not like I'd have to be a third wheel. 
 I can bring a date. 
 What? No It's--it's not that you having a date is funny or -or completely outside of the realm of possibility, just within the gates. 
 One day I might surprise you. 
 go. 
 See you there. 
 You know, if you really like this guy, you should call him, Tell him how you feel. 
 The mature response. 
 tempting. 
 Or if you're looking for something immature, You could tell him you left the phone In the gallery and never got the message. 
 I've seen you be very forgetful. 
 duchess, here. 
 sorry to leave you on your own. 
 Oh, thank you, darling. 
 my pleasure.

 I know, but marcus keeps begging me to consider oxford. 
 What a pity. 
 so much wasted potential. 
 What are you talking about? The thing that always fascinated me about you. 
 The cool exterior, the fire below. 
 You are living proof a person can't buy class. 
 And you can't tell me bertie wooster is satisfying your needs. 
 Titles aside, a suit of armor makes for a cold bedfellow. 
 Not that it's any of your business, But marcus and I have an amazing s*x life. 
 Is that so? mm. 
 What names does he call you when you make love? Where does he put his hand? Does he Have s*x with me.

 Did you do anything this afternoon? No. 
 no. 
 you? No.

 Where's vanessa? Not walking into your trap or whatever it is. 
 Oh, please.

 I just hope it's worth it. 
 Nathaniel, you came. 
 I'm so happy. 
 Seems like forever since I've seen you or heard from you. 
 So you use my friends for some power play to prove you're the one in Control, huh? I don't like sharing my toys, especially if I've paid for them. 
 Where's your friend? I was looking forward to meeting her. 
 no, no. 
 Stop it. 
 look at me. 
 I don't know where I'm gonna get the money from, but you listen-- okay, No, nate, listen.

 Everyone, stay calm. 
 I'm sure the power will be back on in a second. 
 Vanessa.

 well, I am. 
 No, it's okay, marcus. 
 I got it.

 Just come with me, please. 
 I can't believe this. 
 Here I kept thinking, "Nate's so much different than Blair and all the others," But you're just as bad. 
 look, it's not that simple, okay? Are you sleeping with that woman? Yes. 
 Is that the reason you keep canceling on me? Yes, but-- no, Nate. 
 there are no "but"s. 
 You lied to me, and you're sleeping with some mrs. 
 robinson. 
 And while on the upper east side that might be totally normal I didn't sign up for some creepy love triangle with you and someone's mom. 
 She's giving me money. 
 Well, that's just the capper, isn't it? No, my mom and I needed help. 
 I just-- I had no other option. 
 Tell me everything. 
 Now if everyone will just get a drink and a candle, I'm sure the power will be back in a minute. 
 Blair, have you seen Nate? Um, no. 
 it's a blackout. 
 That girl showed up. 
 they went off somewhere together. 
 Honestly, Catherine, so what? If they want to be together, you can't stop them. 
 Just deal with it. 
 I wouldn't expect you to understand. 
 Hot young guy, Aging beauty enjoying her last hurrah before the surgeries start. 
 Tt's called a clich? Is marcus everything you could possibly hope for? Yes, absolutely. 
 Really? thers not one thing that's missing? That one thing you tell yourself you can live without? That you'd happily sacrifice for the rest? so tell you what. 
 You're gonna sacrifice it every day for the rest of your life. 
 Nate makes me feel alive. 
 I'm not gonna give that up. 
 Yeah, my name's Dan Humphrey. 
 Yeah.

 What? No. 
 no, I know when you're thinking of something. 
 Just tell me. 
 no, it's--it's nothing. 
 Serena. 
 well, you--you probably should have mentioned my name. 
 Are you kidding? just forget it. 
 No, seriously. 
 You think that there's, like, a box that says, "open in event of serena van der woodsen emergency"? I live in the building. 
 that's all. 
 No, it's a citywide blackout, So there--there must be hundreds of people stuck in elevators right now. 
 Okay, if you're not gonna call them, can we not talk about it? You're making it hotter. 
 No, Dan-- why not? Yeah, hey.

 You're absolutely right. 
 I am? Yeah. 
 don't let it go to your head. 
 But my mom still thinks chuck's lending us the money, So just sending it through me.

 is determined to have it all. 
 Question is, who with? Nate? Actually, I was looking for him myself. 
 Vanessa, is it? Oh, I see. 
 You're thinking, Look at this awful woman who's taking advantage of an innocent young boy. 
 Nate told me everything. 
 I think what you're doing is disgusting. 
 And yet you're here, waiting for him, willing to forgive and forget. 
 You must really care for him. 
 You wouldn't understand. 
 See, that's where you're wrong. 
 You have no idea how I feel about nate and what I would do to keep him. 
 You want me to tell you? Marcus, is that you? Blow out your candle. 
 I spent the last month going around and meeting with The--the stores and the boutiques that carry my clothes. 
 That must have been so exciting. 
 I felt like a fat cheerleader. 
 As a designer, your worst fear is becoming irrelevant. 
 Then I come back here and find out the Teenage intern tells me that exact thing. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 Maybe that is exactly what I needed to hear. 
 You know, the first real dress I ever bought was one of yours. 
 Just spare me the pity. 
 It's true. 
 I bought it from--well, from a consignment store ah. 
 'cause that was the only way I could afford it. 
 mm-hmm. 
 I was 12, and I just wore it around the apartment for months. 
 It was one of the first things that made me want to become a designer. 
 Jenny. 
 yeah? The light. 
 Oh. 
 sorry.

 If i get avoiding dealing with it last year. 
 Well this is fate that telling us we can. 
 what are you doing? I'm getting out of here. 
 No, someone's coming. 
 The man said so. 
 Right, because someone always come to say Serena Van Der Woodsen. 
 That' not fair. 
 I know it's not. 
 It's not the point. 
 Fine. 
 You know what, life is not fair. 
 Because it doesn't fit with the way you, Dan Humphrey think things should be. 
 But why are you always right? No, I never said that. 
 God hurts. 
 Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Are you sure? I'm sorry, Serena.

 Serena I still-- I know. 
 Me, too. 
 I love you. 
 This isn't going to work. 
 I thought you said you were better.

 You sure you're okay? Yeah. 
 Yeah, it was the right thing. 
 You know, i, uh I-i'm--i'm sorry. 
 I cannot believe that nate archibald is a gigolo. 
 You cannot tell anyone, remember? hey, who would I tell? Who would I tell except everyone I've ever met? I won't. 
 I won't. 
 But why'd you tell him to stay with that woman? I thought you, you know, I thought you liked him. 
 I do. 
 That's-- that's why I did it. 
 I don't understand. 
 She told me that if nate left her, she would go to the f. 
 b. 
 i. 
 And tell them where nate's dad is hiding out. 
 So I really didn't have a choice. 
 Love may fade with the season, but some friendships are year-round, Like you and me. 
 You know you love me.
