 And B's boyfriend Nate? Rumour has it he's always had a thing for Serena.  
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL]  
 Nate 
 But you're back now.  
 Serena 
 I didn't come back for you. Look, Blair is my best friend and you're her boyfriend and she loves you.  
 [INT OSTROFF CENTER - Serena is looking into her brother's room]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Why did she leave? Why did she return?  
 Eleanor 
 Must be a lot of rumours why you're back.  
 Serena 
 Yeah, but none of them mentioned you.  
 [INT OSTROFF CENTER - HALLWAY]  
 Serena 
 He tries to take his own life and you're worried it's gonna cost you 'Mom Of The Year'.  
 Lily 
 You have no idea what it's been like.  
 [FLASHBACK - INT BAR - Serena and Nate are having s*x, Chuck is watching from the balcony]  
 Chuck 
 Best friend and the boyfriend. That's pretty classy, S.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 And Nate's friend Chuck won't let Serena forget about her past.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - KITCHEN]  
 Serena 
 I'm trying to change.  
 Chuck 
 I liked you better before.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BAR - Serena crashes into Dan]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 And then there's Dan: Outsider, looks like his childhood crush has returned.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - FOYER]  
 Dan 
 She doesn't know me. Nobody knows me. It's cool.  
 Concierge 
 Serena! Do you know this young man?  
 Serena 
 Uhm, from last night.  
 Dan 
 You remember me?  
 [Dan walks off but then turns around]  
 Dan 
 You'd really go out with some guy you don't know?  
 Serena 
 Well, you can't be worse than the guys I do know. 
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - KITCHEN]  
 Rufus 
 Guess who's dad is cool!  
 Jenny 
 It's a trick question.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, 'cause it can't be ours.  
 [Dan looks at the front page of 'Rolling Stone']  
 Dan 
 'Top 10 Forgotten Bands Of The '90s'.  
 Rufus 
 Yeah, check out who's number nine.  
 Jenny 
 He's very proud.  
 Dan 
 Hey, hey way to be forgotten.  
 [INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY]  
 Lily 
 Why is my daughter going to one of your concerts?  
 Rufus 
 Well, our kids were about to meet. It's a small island.  
 Lily 
 You're sure it's not some ploy your using my daughter to get to me? Now that your wife left you?  
 [INT 'KISS ON THE LIPS' PARTY - Dan and Serena are walking through the crowd]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Serena and her mystery man made a surprise appearance at Blair's 'Kiss On The Lips' party.  
 Isabel and Katy  
 Serena's here?  
 Blair 
 What is she doing here? She wasn't invited.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 But Serena wasn't the only one who made an impression.  
 [INT 'KISS ON THE LIPS' PARTY - Chuck notices Jenny]  
 Chuck 
 Who's the newbie?  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Jenny made an impression on Chuck.  
 Chuck 
 Let's go and talk somewhere private.  
 [EXT ROOF TOP - Chuck tries violently to kiss Jenny]  
 Jenny 
 No, stop!  
 Dan 
 Hey! That is my little sister!  
 [EXT ROOF TOP - Dan punches Chuck in the face]  
 Serena 
 Don't you ever touch her again!  
 Chuck 
 Hey, you're life is over, slut!  
 [EXT 'KISS ON THE LIPS' PARTY - Blair and Chuck watch Dan, Jenny and Serena get into a cab]  
 Blair 
 She better not show her face again.  
 Chuck 
 I'm actually hoping she will.  
 Dan 
 So, think I've got a shot at a second date?  
 Serena 
 We talk about it in the cab.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 And now that S is back... will the Upper East Side ever be the same? We're all just dying to see what happens next.  
 END OF TEASER  
 [EXT NEW YORK]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 I bet you're wondering what Gossip Girl is doing up so early. Truth is: I never went to bed. Why waste precious time dreaming when waking life is so much better?  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - KITCHEN - Ice cubes are thrown into a bucket, lemons and cucumbers are being sliced, eggs scrambled]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Is there really anything better than a lazy sunday? Reading the paper in bed, sipping coffee, scrambling an egg or two. Yeah, right. We Upper East Siders don't do lazy: Breakfast is brunch and it comes with champagne, a dress code and a hundred of our closest friends... and enemies.  
 [Tables get decorated, flowers arranged, strawberries are being dipped in chocolate]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Chuck's dad Bart Bass is hosting the annual brunch for his foundation. Everyone is invited. Well, not everyone.  
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Dan opens a garage door which seperates his room from his sister's]  
 Dan 
 Oh, hey, you're up.  
 Jenny 
 And you're checking up on me. I'm ok, really, I'm ok. You know, I was ok when you asked me at the party and in the cab, when we got home, before and after I brushed my teeth. Well, I just feel really... stupid. I mean, how could I'Ve actually thought that Chuck Bass just wanted to talk to me?  
 Dan 
 Because you trust people which is normally a good thing.  
 Jenny 
 Yeah, except when it involes Chuck.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, pretty much.  
 Jenny 
 So, the real question is: How are you?  
 Dan 
 Me? Why wouldn't I be ok?  
 Jenny 
 You know, at the end of the night with Serena and the... the...  
 [Jenny makes a waving gesture]  
 Dan 
 Was it really that bad?  
 [FLASHBACK - LAST NIGHT - CAB - Jenny, Dan and Serena are sitting in the cab, Serena is getting out, then stops]  
 Serena 
 This is me. So, good night.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, uhm, yeah, good night.  
 [Serena gets out of the cab]  
 Jenny 
 Go! Walk her to the door! Something! Go!  
 [Dan nods and tries to get out of the cab but the doors slams into his head, the cab starts to drive off]  
 Jenny 
 Whoa, stop, stop, sir, stop, stop!  
 Dan 
 I think I have brain damage.  
 Jenny 
 You know, Dan, if you had brain damage you wouldn't even know you had brain damage.  
 Dan 
 No, let's go, please. Williamsburg.  
 Jenny 
 No!  
 [Serena looks inside through the side window}  
 Dan 
 hi.  
 [Dan waves at Serena, the cab drives off, Serena looks puzzled after the cab and waves slightly]  
 [INT OSTROFF CENTER - ERIK'S ROOM - Erik is sitting on his chair, looking at his hand]  
 Erik 
 So he waved? I wouldn't have taken him for a waver.  
 Serena 
 No, he was just trying to be funny.  
 Erik 
 Or maybe he is shy.  
 Serena 
 Or he hates me.  
 Erik 
 No guy in the history of the world has ever hated you.  
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - JENNY'S ROOM - Dan is pacing up and down, Jenny is lying on her bad looking through a magazine]  
 Dan 
 She probably thinks I hate her now. I waited my entire adolescent life for a date with this girl. You know, Serena van der Woodsen! And I decided to close the evening with a wave.  
 Jenny 
 It was a nice wave.  
 Dan 
 At the end of a date? Come on, there's no such thing. And you only get one shot with a girl like Serena. I got mine and I blew it.  
 Jenny 
 Which means you've got nothing to loose.  
 Dan 
 Nothing except my last shred of dignity.  
 Jenny 
 Oh no, I think that's gone.  
 Dan 
 You're right. You know, I'll just... I'll go talk to here. I'm gonna apologise for the wave, I gonna tell her how much I like her and I'm gonna ask for a second shot... and I'm gonna get a second shot.  
 Jenny 
 Yeah you are!  
 Dan 
 Yeah.  
 [Dan walks out of the room]  
 Jenny 
 Wait, wait, wait! I love the plan but uhm... you need a better outfit... and maybe a shower.  
 [Dan heads into his room and closes the garage door]  
 [INT ERIK'S ROOM - Serena is pacing up and down]  
 Serena 
 Whatever, it is probably for the best. The last thing I need in my life is another guy. He was just so smart, though, and funny...  
 Erik 
 It sounds like you like him.  
 Serena 
 ... and really nice. God, Blair was so plain to me last night. I don't even know why. Whatever, I'm sure if we talk about it we can work it out. Hey, maybe I should go over there.  
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - LIVING ROOM - A note is clipped to a dress: Went to Paris. Bruch at 2. Wear pearls! Eleanor Waldorf, New York]  
 Blair 
 Serena had better just stay away. Thank you, Dohertha!  
 Isabel 
 Thanks!  
 Katy 
 We were sleeping on flares last night.  
 Blair 
 I don't want to see Serena at school and she better not show up at brunch today.  
 Katy 
 You're really mad at Serena.  
 Isabel 
 I hope you never get that mad at us.  
 Blair 
 Well, you would never do what Serena did.  
 Katy 
 No, never.  
 Isabel 
 'Course not.  
 [Isabel looks puzzled at Katy who shrugs her shoulders]  
 Blair 
 I wonder if Nate remembered brunch. It would be so wrong of me to show up without my boyfriend whom I love... and who loves me.  
 [Blair calls Nate]  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM - Nate's cell phone is vibrating on a table covered with cards and poker chips, Nate wakes up on the couch and answers the phone]  
 Nate 
 Hello?  
 [INT THE WALDORF'S LIVING ROOM]  
 Blair 
 Hi sweety. Did I wake you?  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM]  
 Nate 
 No, I'm up.  
 [INT THE WALDORF'S LIVING ROOM]  
 Blair 
 Well, get some strong coffee and jump in the shower, sleepyhead. Chuck's dad's brunch for his foundation is today at The Palace.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM]  
 Nate 
 Ah, great, of course.  
 [Nate hangs up the phone and throws it onto the table, the noise wakes up Chuck who is lying in bed with two women]  
 Chuck 
 Nathaniel! Keep it down! Some of us are trying to regain our strenght.  
 Nate 
 You're dad's brunch is today.  
 Chuck 
 The alarm's set for nine.  
 Nate 
 It's ten.  
 [Chuck sighs, then raises and claps his hands, he has a black eye]  
 Chuck 
 Ladies, double time! Oh, unless... Nathaniel?  
 [Chuck points behind him at the two women]  
 Nate 
 I'm good. [The two women wear maid uniforms and Nate addresses them]  
 Nate 
 Actually, could you two bring some coffee when you get a chance? And some water, lots of water.  
 Maid 
 You want ice with that?  
 [She points at Chuck's black eye]  
 Maid 
 Looks like you could use some.  
 Chuck 
 That's enough, ladies. And I'll make sure to tell my father just how committed you are to the hospitality industry.  
 Nate 
 That kid popped you pretty good, huh? Never mess with a guy's sister.  
 Chuck 
 If I knew his name I'd hunt him down and kill him.  
 Nate 
 What, 'cause you kill people now? Are you gonna strangle him with your scarf?  
 [Nate throws Chuck's scarf into his face, Chuck is preparing a hangover remedy in a blender]  
 Chuck 
 Don't mock the scarf, Nathaniel. It's my signature.  
 Nate 
 Just saying, death by scarf: Not that intimidating.  
 Chuck 
 He sucker-punched me, I told you. Besides, better a broken nose than a broken heart.  
 Nate 
 What? I didn't even talk to Serena last night.  
 Chuck 
 Who said anything about Serena?  
 [INT JENNY'S ROOM - Dan opens the garage door, he has changed his clothes]  
 Dan 
 Do I look ok?  
 Jenny 
 Definitely second shot material.  
 Dan 
 Alright then, I'm gonna go. Oh, uhm, and about what happend, you know, with Chuck... if you want to talk to someone... not your brother, just let me know.  
 Jenny 
 Ok.  
 Yeah, alright.  
 Jenny 
 Hey, there wait! Actually, there is someone I want to talk to.  
 [Jenny grabs her purse and they prepare to leave, Rufus comes home]  
 Dan 
 Hey!  
 Rufus 
 Hey, where are you guys going? I was going to make waffles.  
 Dan 
 Uh, sorry dad.  
 Jenny 
 Yeah, can't.  
 Rufus 
 But I want to know everything about your date.  
 Dan 
 Later.  
 Rufus 
 And your party.  
 Rufus 
 When I get back?  
 You guys missed a really great show! And I make really good waffles!  
 [Dan and Jenny leave]  
 [THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM - Nate is on the phone]  
 Concierge 
 The Palace Hotel.  
 Nate 
 Hi, this is Nate Archibald, calling from the Bass suite. I know you don't normally give out this information but could you tell me what room the van der woodsens are in, please?  
 [EXT NEW YORK - Serena is walking down the street, she is leaving Blair a message on the phone]  
 Serena 
 Hey, Blair, it's me. Eh, I guess you're still sleeping but I'm gonna come over. I think we need to talk. Ok, ehm, see you soon. Bye.  
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Blair checks her missed calls: Serena, she deletes it]  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - All the tables are decorated]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Looks like the tables are all set. As soon as the guests arrive we can start dishing. Here's what's on the menue:  
 [FLASHFORWARD - Serena, Blair, Dan, Chuck, Jenny, Nate, Dan, Blair, Serena, Chuck walks towards Dan but Nate stops him, Blair takes off a blue dress, Jenny is wearing Blair's blue dress and looks at herself in a mirror, Chuck gives Blair a key, Blair and Nate are kissing in an elevator, Blair turns around rapidly]  
 [THE PALACE HOTEL - THE ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Serena is searching through boxes]  
 Serena 
 Mom, did you borrow my Michelle Parise? Uh, I can't find anything in here!  
 Lily 
 Well, it might help if you unpacked. Look, you're home now, it's your life, you should start living it.  
 Serena 
 This is not live, this is a hotel we're living in because you decided you didn't like the colour of the walls in our real home.  
 [Lily hands Serena the green pair of pumps she was looking for]  
 Serena 
 Mom, I said I'd go to this brunch. What else do you want from me?  
 Lily 
 Serena, why are you being like this? You love parties. This is just not like you.  
 Serena 
 Maybe it is like me. Maybe you don't know what I'm really like.  
 Lily 
 Oh, ok, tell me.  
 [Serena puts on her pumps and just stares at her mother]  
 Lily 
 So did you and Dan have fun at the concert last night?  
 Serena 
 We, uhm, never made it. We actually ended up at the 'Kiss On The Lips' party.  
 Lily 
 Ah, well that must have pleased Blair.  
 Serena 
 Blair? Actually no, not that pleased. Which is why I'm going to talk to her.  
 Lily 
 Just be back in time for brunch, ok?  
 Serena 
 Mom!  
 Lily 
 Look, honey, I know how hard it is for you to be back but the more you hide yourself away the more people are gonna think you have something to hide.  
 Serena 
 Coming from someone who's keeping my brother in an institution.  
 Lily 
 That's different.  
 [Serena leaves, Lily shouts after her]  
 Lily 
 I mean it: Don't be late!  
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Serena runs to get a cab]  
 Serena 
 Wait!  
 [Serena gets into the cab just as Dan walks up to The Palace Hotel, Dan enters and walks over to the reception]  
 Dan 
 Hey! How are you doing? I, ah, I was in yesterday with Serena.  
 Concierge 
 How could I forget.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, well, is... she in?  
 Concierge 
 Just missed her, actually, but you're welome to wait.  
 Dan 
 Ok, maybe I will. She probably won't be that long, right?  
 Concierge 
 Once she went out and didn't come back for six month but feel free to sit.  
 [Dan points behind him towards a lounge, the concierge points into the opposite direction]  
 Concierge 
 Over there.  
 Dan 
 Over there is where I'll be. 
 [Dan walks off, Nate walks towards the elevator, the door opens and Lily steps out]  
 Lily 
 Hi, Nate, it's great to see you.  
 Nate 
 Hi, Misses van der Woodsen. Good to see you.  
 Lily 
 Oh, I'm just heading out.  
 [Nate accompanies Lily through the foyer]  
 Nate 
 Oh, is Serena in?  
 Lily 
 Oh, you just missed her but I'll tell her you came by. I'm sure she will be happy to hear it.  
 Nate 
 I... I don't know about that.  
 Lily 
 Oh, what? I mean, Serena loves you and I think she's always a little crush on you. 'Course you and Blair are the perfect couple.  
 Nate 
 Mmh, is Serena going to be long? I could just wait.  
 [They arrive at the reception, Lily nods towards the concierge]  
 Lily 
 Uhm, well, Dexter here can take care of you. I'm just gonna step out for a while and Nate's gonna wait for Serena.  
 Nate 
 Great.  
 Concierge 
 He can get in line behind that guy.  
 [The concierge points towards Dan who's sitting in a chair behind them, Lily and Nate turn around]  
 Lily 
 I had a feeling you'd be back. Dan, is it?  
 [Dan gets up and shakes her hand]  
 Dan 
 Humphrey, yes. It's nice to see you again, Misses van der Woodsen. I hope you had a pleasant, eh, 21 hours since I last saw you. 
 Lily 
 Yes, it has been very pleasant... until now. Gentlemen...  
 [Lily turn around and walks off, Nate and Dan stare at each other]  
 Nate 
 Hey.  
 Dan 
 Hey.  
 [Nate and Dan sit down next to each other]  
 [HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Serena exits the elevator]  
 Serena 
 Blair? Hey.  
 Blair 
 Serena.  
 [Serena takes a copy of 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' out of a bag]  
 Serena 
 Hey., I got two baguettes and Audrey.  
 Blair 
 I must have totally blanked on the part where I invited you over.  
 Serena 
 I... I called you. Blair, it's Sunday morning: Coffee, croissants, 'Breakfast At Tiffany's'. It's our tradition.  
 Blair 
 I have new traditions now.  
 Serena 
 Well, they're not traditions if they're new.  
 [Blair sits down with the Sunday paper and ignores Serena]  
 Serena 
 Look, Blair, I'm really trying to make an effort here. I thought everything was good between us.  
 Blair 
 It was... before I found out you had s*x with my boyfriend.  
 [Serena is looking for words, Blair just stares at her]  
 Serena 
 How did you find out?  
 Blair 
 Nate told me. At least he felt he owed it to me to tell the truth.  
 Serena 
 I don't know what to say.  
 Blair 
 Don't bother saying anything. I wouldn't believe you anyway.  
 Serena 
 Blair, it was...  
 Blair 
 You know... I always knew you're a whore... I never took you for a liar too.  
 Serena 
 Blair, how can I fix this?  
 Blair 
 You don't, Serena. You just stay away from me, my boyfriend and my friends.  
 You're done here.  
 [Blair walks away and leaves Serena behind]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Serena's visit was short and apparently not very sweet but you know what is? Revenge. We hear it's best served cold. Who's hungry?  
 [Serena has already left, Jenny exits the elevator and enters the living room, Blair shouts from the other room]  
 Blair 
 Dohertha, I told you I didn't want to see anyone!  
 [Blair enters the living room and sees Jenny]  
 Blair 
 Hey, Jenny.  
 Jenny 
 Hi.  
 Blair 
 What do you want?  
 Jenny 
 Eh, I realised that I still have your calligraphy pens... from the party invitations and thought you might need them for something.  
 Blair 
 That's the lamest excuse I've ever heard. You wanna know what Chuck Bass is saying about you.  
 Jenny 
 No. Is he... saying things? Is anyone?  
 Blair 
 Mmh, no. Not yet anyway. Chuck likes to brag about his conquests not his victims. Come on, you can help me get ready for brunch.  
 Jenny 
 Ok, sure.  
 [Blair leads Jenny upstairs, Jenny notices an arrangement of flowers]  
 Jenny 
 Nice flowers.  
 Blair 
 They're hydrangeas.  
 [EXT NEW YORK - Lily gets out of a cab]  
 Lily 
 Just coffee. I'm not staying long... I want to get out of here before someone throws me down and tattoos me.  
 Rufus 
 This is Brooklyn, Lil, not the 'Warped Tour' and don't tell me you had all your tattoos removed. I mean, even that one the little heart-shaped one between your, uhm...  
 Lily 
 Don't try to be cute, ok. Those days are way behind you.  
 Rufus 
 And here I thought I was getting better looking every day. So, what's the big emergency?  
 Lily 
 Dan went out with Serena last night.  
 Rufus 
 And as Humphrey I sure am proud of him.  
 [They walk into a coffee shop]  
 Lily 
 Well, currently he is sitting in the lobby of the hotel where we're living.  
 Shop Assistent 
 Hi, how can I help you?  
 Rufus 
 Two americanos, one with an extra shot?  
 Lily 
 Mhm.  
 Rufus 
 You don't actually think that I'm gonna tell my kid you he can and cannot date. I mean is that really the reason you came down here?  
 Lily 
 Oh, I know what you're implying.  
 Rufus 
 That maybe you're falling for me again.  
 Lily 
 You're right, you're right. It's the low income tax bracket, the bad v-neck t-shirts, the awful jokes. I don't know why your wife left you.  
 Rufus 
 Well, she's got better taste than you.  
 [The shop assistant brings them their coffee, Rufus pays]  
 Shop Assistent 
 Here you are. Thanks.  
 Rufus 
 I mean, come on, why else have I seen you more in the last two days than in the last fifteen years?  
 Lily 
 An unfortunate twist of fate.  
 Rufus 
 But fate non the less, unless... you are... are you seeing someone?  
 Lily 
 No, not really.  
 Rufus 
 Aha, not serious... or he's married, that is your type.  
 Lily 
 That's enough, Rufus.  
 Rufus 
 What's his name? Have I read of him in 'Forbes' or 'Rolling Stone'? Well, whoever he is I'm sure he can't keep up with you.  
 Lily 
 Well, I'm gonna take that as a compliment. But I'm serious, I'm worried about Serena. I don't need some new boy influencing her, distracting her from her needs.  
 Rufus 
 Well, no offense, Lil, but I'm guessing a kid like Dan is exactly what Serena needs.  
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan walks away from the main entrance, he meets Nate at the front gate]  
 Dan 
 So, ah, what do you need to talk to Serena about?  
 Nate 
 Nothing, just in the neighborhood. You?  
 Dan 
 I... I'm nowhere near the neighborhood but I'm working on a better excuse.  
 Nate 
 You guys like...  
 Dan 
 Oh, ah, I... I don't know.  
 Nate 
 Yeah, well, that's Serena. With her you'll never know.  
 [Chuck walks towards them, he is wearing black sunglasses]  
 Chuck 
 Nathaniel! There you are. What are you doing?  
 Nate 
 Nothing... just waiting for you.  
 [Chuck notices Dan, he takes of his sunglasses and reveales his black eye]  
 Chuck 
 Him? What are you doing here?  
 Dan 
 Why? What is this... your hotel?  
 Nate 
 Actually, it is.  
 Chuck 
 Yes and unless you have a reason to be here I have to ask you to wait on the curb with the rest of the trash.  
 Dan 
 Trash? Look man, I live in Brooklyn, alright, not the Ozarks... no offense to the Ozarks. But don't you think we're taking this class warfare thing way too far?  
 [Chuck pushes Dan, Nate keeps him back]  
 Nate 
 Ok, man, let's just go.  
 Chuck 
 You told me stick it up for Serena's reputation... if anyone has a reason to kick his ass it's you.  
 Nate 
 It's no warfare. Not here.  
 [Nate leads Chuck away from Dan, Chuck turns to Dan]  
 Chuck 
 This isn't over.  
 Dan 
 Hey, any time, man. That one black eys looks a little lonely.  
 
 
 
 [BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair is trying on the blue dress her mother laid out for her to wear to the brunch, Jenny is with her]  
 Jenny 
 Wow, Blair, it's... it's beautiful. I mean... you look beautiful.  
 Blair 
 It's average. The collar is last season. And besides, Stella McCartney's a much better version of Bergdorf's.  
 [Blair takes the dress off]  
 Jenny 
 Right. I... I've been meaning to go by Bergdorf's.  
 [Jenny walks over to Blair's bed and picks up a doll]  
 Jenny 
 Wow, these dolls are great. Oh my god, you've got 'Cabbage Patch'. My brother used to have one of these. His name was Cedric.  
 Blair 
 You're brother's name is Cedric?  
 Jenny 
 No, that was his 'Cabbage Patch Kid'. My brother's name is Dan. Actually, you might know him. He, uhm, he went out with Serena last night.  
 Blair 
 That was your brother? So does that mean you're friends with Serena now?  
 Jenny 
 I mean, I don't have a problem with her but if someone did have a problem with her I wouldn't have a problem with that either.  
 Blair 
 You know if you like that dress... you can have it.  
 Jenny 
 What? No, no.  
 Blair 
 I'm sure you'll find some way to repay me.  
 Jenny 
 Wow, Blair, thank you, I mean, for the dress and... for the other thing... about that Chuck.  
 Blair 
 If you want to be part of this world, Jenny, people will talk... eventually. And you need to decide if all this... is worth it.  
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan is waiting for Serena, she walks up to him]  
 Serena 
 Dan, hey.  
 Dan 
 I, I... I was in the neighborhood... uhm, give or take seventy blocks. Uhm, I just wanted to tell you in person that, eh, the end of last night may not have been my finest hour. It was a, eh, a wave.  
 [Dan makes a waving gesture]  
 Serena 
 I, I... I saw that.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, yeah. Since then I've just been wondering... eh... are you hungry?  
 Serena 
 Yes. Actually, I had the worst morning.  
 Dan 
 Do you... do you wanna talk? And eat? Not necessarily in that order.  
 Serena 
 Yes, I would love to do both but food first because I'm starving.  
 [Lily walks up to them]  
 Lily 
 Great, just in time for brunch.  
 Serena 
 Mom.  
 Dan 
 Miss van der Woodsen.  
 Lily 
 Dan, you're still here.  
 Serena 
 Look, mom, I really don't think it's a good idea for me to go to that brunch.  
 Lily 
 You promised.  
 Serena 
 Yeah, but that was before... before I knew Dan was hungry too. I can't let the boy starve.  
 Dan 
 It would be inhumane.  
 Lily 
 He's not invited.  
 Serena 
 Yeah, that's why I'm going with him.  
 Dan 
 Because I can't go with her.  
 Serena 
 And we have plans to go to brunch together today.  
 Dan 
 We had those plans.  
 Lily 
 Serena, you're home: Living under my roof, my rules. What is it gonna take to get you dressed and through that door?  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Dan and Serena stand at the entrance, Dan looks a little overwhelmed, there are models painted white to pose as statues, Howie Archibald, Bart Brass and Lily are all there, Nate, Chuck, Blair, Katy and Isabel are sitting together laughing and drinking, Blair notices Serena and her mouth drops]  
 Serena 
 You know, maybe... maybe this was a... a bad idea.  
 [Back at the table]  
 Blair 
 You got to be kidding.  
 [Back at the entrance]  
 Dan 
 Yeah, this was... this was definitely a bad idea  
 [Back at the table, Chuck notices Dan]  
 Chuck 
 This should be fun.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Looks like Chuck and Blair showed up with quite some appetite... for destruction that is.  
 [Dan and Serena finally enter the ball room]  
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Rufus is playing the guitar, Jenny enters with her new blue dress in a transparent cloth bag]  
 Jenny 
 Hey, dad. How's the new song going?  
 Rufus 
 Ah, I think I need more coffee.  
 Jenny 
 Whatever works.  
 [Rufus notices the dress]  
 Rufus 
 Where did you get the dress?  
 Jenny 
 Oh, it was a thank you gift from Blair for doing the party invitations.  
 Rufus 
 Looks like a very expensive thank you gift.  
 Jenny 
 Dad, she's got a closed the size of this appartement just full of them. See, her mom designed it.  
 Rufus 
 And her mom is very talented... but the dress you made for yourself is much nicer.  
 Jenny 
 Which is why you don't wear dresses.  
 Rufus 
 One of a couple reasons.  
 Jenny 
 Hey, you think the Farmers' Market is still open?  
 Rufus 
 Yeah, why? You wanna go?  
 Jenny 
 Yeah.  
 Rufus 
 I thought you were getting too old to go places with your dad.  
 Jenny 
 Well, you used to be cool. And the '90s are having a comeback.  
 Rufus 
 You have no idea how much that hurts.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Dan and Serena are standing at the decadent buffet]  
 Dan 
 Well, can't say much for his child bearing skills but Bart Brass knows brunch.  
 [Serena notices Nate who nods towards her to signal he wants to talk to her outside] 
 Serena 
 Uhm, I... I need to use the ladies' room. You think you be ok for yourself for a while?  
 Dan 
 Yeah, come on, me and some Beluga caviar? Can't get enough of this stuff.  
 Serena 
 Ok.  
 [Serena leaves, Dan turns to one of the painted models]  
 Dan 
 Hey, how's it going?  
 [The model doesn't answer or move]  
 Dan 
 No? You don't... ok, just... go ahead do your thing.  
 [Dan turns around and finds Chuck, they stare at each other for a while until Chuck turns to his father]  
 Bart 
 Charles!  
 [Bart turns away from a guest]  
 Bart 
 Would you excuse me?  
 Guest 
 Of course.  
 Chuck 
 Father.  
 Bart 
 The, uh, the invitation said 'Black Tie' not 'Black Eye'. Are you ok? I mean if you're in some kind of trouble...  
 Chuck 
 Only of my own making.  
 Bart 
 Why do you think I do all this, hu? This party is for you. Ok, so you can meet people. You know, become a part of something, make some kind of change.  
 Chuck 
 Really? I thought it was another excuse for an open bar and, eh, re-hiring the milanese statues.  
 Bart 
 Do me a favour, will you? Lose the scotch... it's barely noon.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - OUTSIDE OF THE BALL ROOM - Nate is waiting, Serena arrives]  
 Nate 
 Serena, I really need to talk to you.  
 Serena 
 Actually, I need to talk to you which means you can listen. Nate, you told Blair! What were you thinking?  
 Nate 
 Look, I wanna explain...  
 [A party guest interrupts them because they're standing in her way]  
 Guest 
 Excuse me.  
 Nate 
 Sorry.  
 [They move a little apart and let her through]  
 Nate 
 We can't talk here.  
 Serena 
 What? Where Blair might see us?  
 Nate 
 Meet me in Chuck's suite.  
 [Nate talks a key out of his pocket]  
 Serena 
 I'm not sneaking around with you.  
 Nate 
 Please, just to talk.  
 [Serena takes the key]  
 Serena 
 Ten minutes.  
 Nate 
 I meet you up there.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Howie is talking to Blair]  
 Howie 
 You look beautiful as always. Where's you're lovely mother today?  
 Blair 
 Paris. Must be some drama at the atelier.  
 Howie 
 Nothing too dramatic, I hope. Her line is doing very well. I was just telling my firm what a great investment she'd make. She's really going places.  
 Blair 
 Hopefully places far far away. Just kidding.  
 [Nate walks over and takes Blair's empty glass]  
 Nate 
 Hey. I'll get you a refill. I'll be right back.  
 Howie 
 I'll go with you. Excuse us.  
 [Nate kisses Blair on the cheek and they walk away]  
 Howie 
 Blair seems happy. Looks like... you're taking care of business as we discussed. 
 Nate 
 Dad, not everything in life's a business deal.  
 Howie 
 Come talk to me in thirty years.  
 [They walk up to a guest]  
 Howie 
 I want to introduce you to Timothy Good. His firm has some really interessting summer interships.  
 [Nate and Mr. Good shake hands]  
 Nate 
 Hey.  
 Mr. Good 
 Nice to meet you.  
 [Chuck walks up to Blair]  
 Blair 
 I can't believe Serena came to this brunch. I told her to stay away.  
 Chuck 
 You worried about Nate? Just a shot in the dark. I think you know what you need to do to get his attention.  
 [Chuck offers her a key]  
 Blair 
 And what's that?  
 Chuck 
 A key to my suite, Nate's heart and your future happiness.  
 [Blair takes the key]  
 Chuck 
 I'm honored to be playing an even small role in your deflowering.  
 Blair 
 You're disgusting.  
 Chuck 
 Yes, I am. So why be shy? Just grab Nate and finish this. Report back with details. 
 [Blair walks off]  
 [Blair walks over to Nate who is just saying goodbye to Mr. Good and his father]  
 Nate 
 Nice to meet you. Dad.  
 Blair 
 What are you doing right now?  
 Nate 
 Ah, well, I was just gonna...  
 Blair 
 What about me?  
 Nate 
 Uhm...  
 Blair 
 Do you have a better offer or...  
 Nate 
 No, of course not.  
 Blair 
 Yeah?  
 Nate 
 Now?  
 Blair 
 Now. Now.  
 [Blair and Nate leave, Chuck looks after them]  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - The elevator doors open and reveal Nate and Blair kissing]  
 Nate 
 Where are we going?  
 Blair 
 I've got us the best room in the whole place.  
 [INT CHUCK'S ROOM - Blair pushes Nate through the door]  
 Nate 
 Wait, this is Chuck's room.  
 [Serena is already there]  
 Serena 
 Nate...  
 [Blair looks at Serena in disbelief]  
 Blair 
 Serena?  
 Serena 
 Blair.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Spotted: N and B, hot and heavy in the halls of The Palace Hotel, only to find S already waiting. Sparks were flying for sure... but will it be a three-way? Or D-day? 
 Blair 
 What is she doing here?  
 Serena 
 I was waiting for Nate.  
 Nate 
 Just to talk, I swear.  
 Blair 
 You said you'd never speak to her again!  
 Serena 
 You said that? Why would you say that?  
 Blair 
 Because you can't be trusted!  
 Nate 
 It's not Serena's fault.  
 Blair 
 Do not defend her!  
 Nate 
 I asked her to come.  
 Blair 
 Oh, oh, so you want to talk to her.  
 Nate 
 Yes. Yes, to explain... why I'm not talking to her.  
 Blair 
 Maybe I leave you two to finish that fascinating conversation.  
 Serena 
 Uh, no, no, I'll go. Let you guys get back to your quicky.  
 Blair 
 It wasn't a quicky. s*x is actually kind of a big deal to some of us.  
 Serena 
 Oh, yeah, I can see that. Chuck's bed? Very romantic. Classy too.  
 Blair 
 Oh, like you. I bet your new friend Dan would love to hear all about how classy you are.  
 Serena 
 Dan? What...  
 [Blair runs off]  
 Serena 
 God, do you really think she's gonna tell him?  
 Nate 
 It's Blair.  
 [They run after her]  
 Serena 
 I can't believe you told her.  
 Nate 
 You just expected me to keep it a secret?  
 Serena 
 Yes, Nate. There's nothing wrong with keeping a secret if the truth is gonna hurt someone!  
 Nate 
 That's a hell of a way to look at things.  
 Serena 
 Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise in all this you were the most honest guy on the planet.  
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan is stepping outside to look for Serena, he sees Bart and Lily talking to each other]  
 Bart 
 It just seems to me that you're the one doesn't want to be seen together in public.  
 Lily 
 No, I do want to be seen together. I just don't want to see you together with anyone else. Tell your harem of shopgirls and models that you're seeing someone.  
 Bart 
 I am... but those conversations take a little time.  
 Lily 
 Well, they got nothing but time, Bart, they're twenty-five.  
 [Lily notices Dan standing by the entrance looking at them]  
 Lily 
 Excuse me.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan walks back inside, Lily follows him]  
 Lily 
 Dan, wait! Look, I really don't appreciate your lurking in the shadows eavesdropping on my private conversation.  
 Dan 
 What? No, no, I wasn't. I was looking for Serena.  
 Lily 
 Well, I don't see her. Do you?  
 Dan 
 No, which is why I was looking.  
 Dan 
 I don't know what you're doing here or what you think you heard...  
 Dan 
 Nothing, I heard nothing.  
 But Serena doesn't know.  
 Dan 
 And neither do I, ok? So now if you excuse me, I'm gonna go back inside, not tell anyone a thing and mind my own business.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Blair walks up to Dan]  
 Blair 
 Dan? Hi, I'm Blair Waldorf, Serena's friend.  
 Dan 
 Oh, hey. Yeah, do you happen to know where she is?  
 Blair 
 As a matter of fact I do.  
 [Serena and Nate come running in]  
 Serena 
 Blair!  
 Dan 
 Serena, there you are.  
 Serena 
 Hi.  
 Where were you?  
 Blair 
 She was waiting in a hotel room... for my boyfriend.  
 Serena 
 To talk!  
 Nate 
 About why we weren't talking.  
 Blair 
 That doesn't sound any smarter the second time.  
 Dan 
 Why weren't you talking? Does this have anything to do with why you were waiting for Serena this morning?  
 Blair 
 You were what?  
 [Chuck joins them]  
 Chuck 
 And here I thought you were waiting for me.  
 Oh, exactly what the situation needs: Chuck. No what is going on here?  
 Blair 
 We were just getting to that.  
 Serena 
 Blair, please, don't do this.  
 Blair 
 Sorry, did you want to tell him?  
 Chuck 
 I'll tell him.  
 Nate and Blair 
 You know?  
 Chuck 
 I know everything.  
 Dan 
 And apparently I know nothing.  
 Serena 
 Look, Dan, it was a long time ago and I regret it...  
 Chuck 
 Look, Serena, stop trying to pretend you're a good girl. So you slept with best friend's boyfriend. I kind of admire you for it.  
 Dan 
 Is that true?  
 Blair 
 Well, than she ran away and lied about it. I just thought you should know before you fall head over heels for your perfect girl in her perfect world... and then get left all alone with no one but your 'Cabbage Patch Kid'.  
 Nate 
 'Cabbage Patch'?  
 Dan 
 Did you talk to my sister?  
 Chuck 
 Ah, yes, little Jenny. Do believe she and I have some unfinished business. 
 [Dan walks up close to Chuck]  
 Dan 
 You stay away from her.  
 Chuck 
 Poor devil, so little time so many sluts to fu...  
 [Dan pushes Chuck who crushes into a waiter causing him to fall down, all guests turn around to look at the scene, Katy is making photos with her cell phone while Isabel is texting]  
 Dan 
 It's fine! It's fine! Everyone can stop looking. He's a jerk. But it's my fault and... and I'm leaving.  
 Serena 
 I'll go with you.  
 Dan 
 Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't.  
 [Dan walks off]  
 Nate 
 Hope you're happy.  
 Blair 
 Not even close.  
 [Blair walks off, Nate follows her]  
 Chuck 
 Looks like it's just you and me. Apparently my room's available if...  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Some might call this a fustercluck... but on the Upper East Side we call it Sunday afternoon.  
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Serena is running after Dan]  
 Serena 
 Dan! Dan, wait! I'm so sorry.  
 Dan 
 There's... there's no need to be, really. I shouldn't have come here today. I made a mistake.  
 Serena 
 No, you didn't. Look, I'm sorry about Blair and Chuck...  
 Dan 
 It's not about Blair or Chuck... I mean, it is but it's not just them.  
 Serena 
 No, I know. Trust me, I know. This world... it's crazy.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, yeah it is... and you're part of it.  
 Serena 
 What... and you didn't know that?  
 Dan 
 I don't know... I thought you were different.  
 [Dan turns around and starts walking away]  
 Serena 
 Well, I'm sorry I'm not who you thought I was. But.. what's happened is in the past, you know.  
 [Dan stops]  
 Serena 
 And all that I can do is try to change. But if you can't accept that then... you know... you're not who I thought you were. Well, I guess we both made mistakes. 
 [Serena walks away from Dan, Dan looks after her, then starts walking, Serena turns around but Dan is leaving]  
 [HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - KITCHEN - Dan is sitting at the counter drinking tea, Jenny and Rufus come home, Jenny is holding a pot with flowers]  
 Jenny 
 Hi.  
 Rufus 
 Hey, Jen said you went looking for Serena. Did you find her?  
 Dan 
 Yeah, yeah, I found her and then I lost her.  
 Rufus 
 Oh, eh, that's... eh...  
 Dan 
 It's fine. It's fine, really. It's all for the best. Serena and her friends and her family... her whole world... turns out it wasn't for me.  
 Jenny 
 Wait, Dan. What happened?  
 Jenny 
 Did you tell Blair Waldorf about Cedric?  
 Jenny 
 I... it may have come up.  
 Dan 
 You can't trust these people, Jen. Don't tell them anything. Those are nice floweres.  
 Jenny 
 They're hydrangeas.  
 [HOME OF THE WALDROFS - BLAIR'S ROOM - Nate and Blair are lying in bed together, both are fully dressed, Blair has her back turned to Nate]

 [Nate puts his hand on her shoulders and he covers it with hers]  
 [EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Dan is stepping outside on the fire escape]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Well, Serena's mytery man is a mystery no longer. His name is... oh, who cares. Now that he and S are over... so are his fifteen minutes. 
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - JENNY'S ROOM - Jenny is wearing her new blue dress and looks at herself in the mirror]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 But his sister Jenny was spotted with a new dress... gifted from Blair herself. Everyone knows an Eleanor original is the uniform of B's private army. But will J be a loyal soldier? Or will she side with S's rebel forces?  
 [THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM - Chuck is lying on his bed looking at 'Gossip Girl' on his cell phone, a blonde is cooling his black eye with ice]  
 And as for S herself: We hear she left today's brunch with... no friends, no boy and nowhere left to run.
