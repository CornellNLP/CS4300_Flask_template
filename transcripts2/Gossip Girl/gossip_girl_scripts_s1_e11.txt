 How's your mom doing? 
 Blair 
 My dad left her for another man. 
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS] 
 Dan 
 Something about mom and her neighbor. 
 Rufus 
 Yeah, it's complicated. 
 [Jenny walks in] 
 Dan 
 Mom's having an affair. It's easy for me to say it. 
 [INT THE HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS] 
 Alison 
 It happened one time and it's over. 
 Rufus 
 And why did our daughter have to go to Hudson and drag you back here? 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Rufus kisses Lily, Bart sees them] 
 Rufus 
 I'm sorry I kissed you but I did it because I thought he should know how it feels to loose you. 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL] 
 Bart 
 So, when can we go public? 
 Lily 
 My kids have to know first. 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 Dan 
 My friend Vanessa, she moved away to Vermont last year... now she's back. 
 [INT BLAIR'S BIRTHDAY PARTY - Serena is talking to Vanessa]

 You guys just have everything in common and, uhm, I'm just getting to know him. 
 [INT LIMOUSINE - Blair kisses Chuck]

 [EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - Bazaar - Jenny sings in a choir] 
 Choir 
 Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue, I'll wait up for you dear... Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight... 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Hey, Upper East Siders. It's christmas in New York and along with the season comes the Constance Billard and St. Jude's Bazaar where the only thing bizarre are the donated items for sale. 
 [Dan and Serena are walking through the bazaar] 
 Dan 
 What about an antice butter churn? 
 Serena 
 Oh my gosh, that would go so well with my loom. 
 [Serena picks up a fur hat and puts it on Dan's head] 
 Serena 
 I know what I'm getting you for christmas now. 
 Dan 
 Oh, for when I move to Siberia? 
 Serena 
 No... 
 Dan 
 Come on, New York doesn't even get cold anymore and it never snows. You know my chest hurts more than open fire when it feels like Florida. 
 Serena 
 Ok, global-warming-grinch. 
 Dan 
 I'm just saying, christmas should be white and snowy... or even set off Manhattan's sludge. 
 [Vanessa walks towards them] 
 Vanessa 
 There you are! 
 Dan 
 Hey, Vanessa, what are you doing here? 
 Serena 
 Hey. 
 Vanessa 
 Merry christmas! 
 [Vanessa hands Dan a rolled up issue of 'The New Yorker'] 
 Dan 
 This is a copy of 'The New Yorker'. Thank you. But you know I already have a subsription. 
 Vanessa 
 There's something else in there... a letter. What does it say Serena? 
 [Vanessa takes the magazine back and lets Serena pull out a letter which she reads out loud] 
 Serena 
 Dear Mr. Humphrey, we are pleased to advise you we would like to publish you short-story in our 'Summer Fiction' issue featuring '20 under 20'! 
 Vanessa 
 It's a contest for young unknown writers and I might have submitted you. 
 [Dan takes the letter] 
 Dan 
 Oh my god, I'm gonna be published! I mean 'The New Yorker'... this can't be... this can't be real, is this... is this real? 
 Serena 
 This is so great! I haven't even read one of your stories. 
 Vanessa 
 Don't worry he doesn't show them to anyone. I swipped this one out of his drawer in the pretence of borrowing a stapler. 
 Dan 
 Click. You have to return that stapler by the way. 
 [Serena takes the letter back] 
 Serena 
 Let's see, your story is called '10-8-05'. What's that date? 
 Dan 
 Vanessa, thank you, I don't know how you did this but this is the best present ever. 
 Choir 
 ... So hurry down the chimney tonight... hurry... tonight, Santa baby. 
 [Rufus and Alison get out of a cab and enter the bazaar] 
 Rufus 
 I can't believe we just took a cab for $32. 
 Alison 
 Oh, I can't believe you were gonna wait an hour for another subway. 
 Rufus 
 They said another train was on its way. 
 [Alison makes her way through the crowed and passes Lily and Bart] 
 Alison 
 Excuse me... pardon me. 
 Lily 
 Rufus, Alison, hello. 
 Alison 
 Hey! 
 Oh, Rufus, uh, you remember... my friend Bartholomew Bass. 
 Bart 
 Hi, from, uh, Eleanor's. 
 [Rufus and Bart shake hands] 
 Yeah, hello. 
 Alison 
 Eleanor's? 
 Rufus 
 Oh, this is my wife Alison. 
 Alison 
 Hi. 
 [Alison and Bart shake hands] 
 Bart 
 How do you do. 
 Lily 
 Well, it's lovely to see you both. Excuse us, please. 
 [Lily and Bart walk away] 
 Alison 
 I guess Lily has targeted her next billionaire. 
 Rufus 
 Actually, I think she had him in her sights for a while. 
 [INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - HALLWAY] 
 Lily 
 Well, that was awkward. 
 Bart 
 It wouldn't be if you let people know what we are doing together. 
 Lily 
 I'm just starting to trust you again. 
 Bart 
 And the reason you didn't trust me last time was because of a misunderstanding. 
 Lily 
 Yes, and to avoid another one, please understand that if it doesn't work out between us again I'm gonna feel twice as humiliated. 
 Bart 
 Not telling people about us ensures that we don't work out. Look, when I committed myself to you I meant it. You know I am in love with you. What are you waiting for? 
 [Blair walks towards them, she is holding two big candy canes] 
 Lily 
 Blair! Oh, happy holidays! 
 Blair 
 Happy holidays, Miss van der woodsen. 
 [Lily and Blair kiss each other on the cheeks] 
 Blair 
 Mister Bass, I didn't think you were still in town... I figured you were... 
 Bart 
 ... with Charles. No, sadly I'm stuck here on business while he suns himself at my hotel in Monaco. I have my staff keeping an eye on him and I'll join him for New Year's. 
 Blair 
 Oh, right, I... I uhm... was wondering why he's been so quiet... and Monaco answers my question. Lovely to see you two. Bye. 
 [Blair walks off, she sends a text message to Chuck: 'Monaco huh? Anything I need to know'] 
 [Serena walks up behind her] 
 Serena 
 Blair! Tere you are. 
 Blair 
 I can't talk right now, Serena. I'm late and I have... 
 [Serena points at the candy canes] 
 Serena 
 ... a huge sweet tooth? 
 Blair 
 They're for my dad and me, we get them every year. And he landed from Paris 27 minutes ago. 
 [Serena walks towards the exit and drags Blair with her] 
 Serena 
 Oh, then vite, vite, I parle while you marche. Come on, I said vite! 
 [They exit the bazaar and Blair hails for a cab but it drives right by] 
 Blair 
 Hey! Nice holiday spirit, Scrooge 
 Serena 
 Oh gosh, it's gonna be a real Waldorf christmas? 
 Blair 
 A real Waldorf chistmas eve. Eleanor drew the line at christmas day. That's only for me, her and Doherta. 
 Serena 
 Well, you still have a couple of days with your dad. 
 Blair 
 No, it will be more than just a couple of days. I'm gonna convince him to stay in New York. 
 Serena 
 What about Paris and Roman? 
 Blair 
 Roman is a phase. My father belongs here with me. He only left New York to ride out the scandal. 
 Serena 
 Oh. 
 [Serena and Blair hail for a cab] 
 Blair 
 Time to come home, don't you think? Didn't you want to ask me something? 
 Serena 
 Yes, a gift idea for Dan... now that Vanessa got him the most thoughtful DaNate 
 like present ever. 
 Blair 
 Why don't you just buy him a new outfit for Cedric and call it a day? 
 Serena 
 Thank you for being totally not helpful at all? 
 [Blair shrugs and gets into the cab] 
 Serena 
 See you tomorrow night. 
 Blair 
 Bye. 
 [The cab drives off] 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Blair runs towards her father, Harold] 
 Harold 
 Blair-bear! 
 [They hug] 
 Harold 
 Oh, look at you. More beautiful than ever. Sweetheart, you remember Roman. 
 [Roman, Harold's boyfriend, enters] 
 Roman 
 Blair, you are still perfection. 
 [Roman hugs Blair who is less then enthusiastic about it] 
 Roman 
 Delicate, yet full with flavour... like a macaron. 
 [Roman hands her a box of macaron, Eleanor walks in] 
 Eleanor 
 Imagine my surprise when the elevator door opened and out popped both of them. 
 Harold 
 Well, I didn't think you'd mind. 
 [Harold points at Roman and Blair] 
 Harold 
 It's the perfect opportunity for you two to get to know each other better. 
 Blair 
 Absolutely. This is for you. 
 [Blair hands one of the candy canes to her father] 
 Harold 
 Sweetheart, you remembered. It's our tradition. 
 [Blair hands the other one to Roman] 
 Blair 
 This is for you. 
 Roman 
 Merci, Blair. 
 Blair 
 My pleasure. 
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Rufus is holding the letter from 'The New Yorker', Alison is decorating the christmas tree] 
 Rufus 
 My son, the writer. 
 Alison 
 Published writer. 
 Jenny 
 You got your dreamgirl and you're storming 'The New Yorker'... maybe you should just die now. 
 Dan 
 It's true... I may have peaked. 
 [Dan opens the mail] 
 Dan 
 This one's from the Smiths: Season's Greetings. It's their original. 
 Jenny 
 The name is Smith, you don't have to be original. 
 Dan 
 This one is from, uh, Alex. 
 Alison 
 What? 
 Dan 
 Alison, meet me on the 24th... 
 Alison 
 No, Dan... 
 Dan 
 And that's not a christmas card. 
 [Rufus stares at Alison and then takes Alex's letter from Dan, he walks back to Alison and they start whispering] 
 Rufus 
 Why is he writing to you? Sending cards to the house, asking you to see you? 
 Alison 
 I don't know. 
 Dan 
 You guys we're... we're still here. We can hear you. 
 Alison 
 Rufus, it's over with Alex. Ok? I'm home now with my family. 
 Rufus 
 Good. 
 [Rufus turns around and sighs loudly] 
 Rufus 
 Let's all rewind and just pretend this never happened. This is not gonna ruin our christmas. 
 [EXT CENTRAL PARK - Harold and Roman are walking a few steps behind Eleanor and Blair, Harold and Blair are carrying ice skates] 
 Blair 
 I can't believe you're ok with this. 
 Eleanor 
 Who said I am ok with this. What am I supposed to do? Make a scene and then behave like some pathetic scorned wife? No! 
 Blair 
 Roman doesn't even know how to ice-skate! Can't you escort him out of the park on your way to your meeting... and you drop him at a nail saloon? 
 Eleanor 
 I can not bother myself trying to wrestle Roman away from you. I have to mentally prepare. I am meeting with the CEO of Victoria Secret, after all! 
 Roman 
 Victoria Secret? 
 Eleanor 
 Yes. I'm... I'm designing a line of retro-chic sleepwear and lingerie... 
 Blair 
 I am looking forward to the samples. We're all very proud. In fact, mom, why don't you tell Roman all about it? I'm sure he will be fascinated. 
 [Eleanor and Roman walk off together, Blair stays behind with her father] 
 Blair 
 So good to have you here. 
 Harold 
 Well, it's good to be here. Now, where's the handsome Nate? Am I gonna see him tonight? 
 Blair 
 Well, he is in Connceticut with his mom. He said he will try to catch a train to make it to the party tonight. 
 Harold 
 Ah, well, an Eleanor Waldorf soirée: Another New York institution I miss. 
 Blair 
 You know, you don't have to miss any of it. 
 Harold 
 Well, I wish I could be in two places at once, my dear, but... impossible, sorry. You know that château near Lyonne that I told you about? 
 Blair 
 Mhm. 
 Harold 
 Well, Roman and I bought it. 
 Blair 
 You bought that place? 
 Harold 
 Yes. 
 Blair 
 And with Roman? 
 Harold 
 The house is flooded with light, the fireplaces are big enough you can walk into them, the gardens are incroyable. 
 [A man, Jack, and his niece walk up to Eleanor and Blair] 
 Jack 
 Uh, pardon me. I'm taking my niece skating and I can't seem to locate the rink. 
 Eleanor 
 But... it's right over there. 
 [Eleanor points behind him, Jack turns around] 
 Jack 
 'Course, the crownd of children inmitten should have tipped me off. Thank you. 
 Eleanor 
 You're welcome. 
 [Jack stares for a moment at Eleanor but then walks off with his niece] 
 Roman 
 The handsome man was just flirting with you. 
 Eleanor 
 That's absurd... he was not flirting with me. 
 [Roman grins and Eleanor hits him with her purse] 
 [EXT CENTRAL PARK - ICE RINK] 
 Eleanor 
 Roman, it is going to be so dull for you to sit and watch them skate. 
 Blair 
 Yes, why don't you to the petting zoo... feed the sheep? 
 Roman 
 Or why don't I join you at the rink? It looks fun. 
 Harold 
 Wonderful! 
 Harold 
 Yes, superb! 
 Harold 
 I get you skates. 
 [Harold and Roman walk off] 
 Harold 
 See you there. 
 Blair 
 Super! 
 [Eleanor walks off, Blair stares after her] 
 [INT COFFEE SHOP - Vanessa is waiting a table and then walks over to Dan who is looking through a bunch of old issues of 'The New Yorker'] 
 Vanessa 
 You're not autographing those and sell them on ebay, are you? 
 Dan 
 No, oh no, I'm just checking out some of the previous publishees... and I'm in great company here. It's 'The New Yorker', V! How can I top this? I can't, really. Unless I the raid Oscars for one of your documentaries. 
 Vanessa 
 You got in on your own merit. The only gift I gave you was a liquor stamp. And as for me, the annual Dan Humphrey christmas CD mix is more than enough. 
 Dan 
 Alright, yeah. 
 [Vanessa walks off, Serena walks into the coffee shop with a bag] 
 Dan 
 Hey! What's in the bag? 
 Perfection. Look, I know it's not christmas yet but open it, please. I can't wait, I'm too excited! 
 [Serena gets a box out of the bag and Dan starts to open it] 
 Dan 
 Oh my... 
 [The box contains an expensive watch with a black leather band] 
 Serena 
 I noticed the other day that you don't wear a watch and then it occurred to me it's because you don't have a watch and you're gonna need one to be punctual for all your meetings with editors and publishers... now that you're a fancy... 
 [Serena looks at the issues of 'The New Yorker'] 
 Serena 
 ... and appartently self-important writer. 
 [Dan looks at the watch and frowns] 
 Serena 
 You don't like it. You want the brown band. 
 Dan 
 No, no, no! I love the band, I love the whole thing... it's just... it'S the most amazing watch I've ever seen... but I can't accept this. 
 Serena 
 What? Oh yes you can! Look, it's more of a gift to me because I had so much fun picking it out for you. You have to. 
 Dan 
 Serena, I buy a book for my dad every christmas. I think the most elaborate gift I've ever given was a pair of rubber boots from L.L.Bean. 
 Serena 
 so then I overdid it? 
 Dan 
 I think even your underdoing it would be overdoing it. Look, uhm, let's... let's set some rules, maybe some helpful guidelines. 
 Serena 
 Fine. Deadline? 
 Dan 
 Ehm, tomorrow morning. Price limit? 
 Serena 
 50 bucks. 
 Dan 
 Alright. May the best gift win. 
 [Dan kisses Serena and she walks off, taking the watch with her, Vanessa stops her on her way out] 
 Vanessa 
 Hey, uhm... 
 Serena 
 Hey. 
 Vanessa 
 If it's any help I can tell you his favourite used bookshop. 
 Serena 
 That's ok. I think I got it. 
 [Serena leaves the coffee shop] 
 [INT BAR - Rufus walks in and goes up to a guy sitting at the counter] 
 Rufus 
 Are you Alex? 
 Alex 
 Who are you? 
 Rufus 
 Rufus Hummphrey. Unless you want to be carried out of here you're gonna stay the hell away from my wife. 
 Alex 
 Calm down, man. 
 Rufus 
 You send a letter to my wife... in my house where my children live? Whatever you had with her is over. 
 Alex 
 Why don't you sit down? 
 Rufus 
 She told you to leave her alone. 
 Alex 
 I'm sorry... that's not what she told me a couple of days ago. 
 Rufus 
 Excuse me, you... you spoke to her? 
 [EXT CENTRAL PARK - ICE RINK - Blair stands at the railing, she looks frustrated, Harold tries to help Roman who stumbles over the ice] 
 Harold 
 You can do it! 
 Roman 
 No! 
 Harold 
 You can do it! Look at all those children... they are skating around effortlessly. 
 Roman 
 Come on, they've got a much shorter way to fall! 
 Harold 
 Blair! Will you help us here? We need you! 
 Blair 
 Just a second! My laces came undone! 
 [Blair takes out her cell phone and looks at a new text message: From: Chuck, Only 1 question: How did you fake ur virginity for N?] 
 [Roman stumbles towards Blair] 
 Harold 
 Ready? Now got to Blair. You can do it! 
 Roman 
 Blair! Come give us a lesson! 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Spotted spinning at Wallman Rink: The Blair Capades. All the grace of Nancy Kerrigan but packing the punch of Tonya Harding. 
 [Blair opens her arms to catch Roman but when he reaches her she trips him up, Roman falls down and Harold hurries towards him] 
 Harold 
 Bravo, Roman. Ca va? 
 [Harold and Blair help him up, Roman looks at Blair who smiles at him innocently] 
 Harold 
 You're alright? 
 Roman 
 I'm so clumsy. My foot got caught behind her skate. 
 Blair 
 Oh, here let me help you. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - ELEVATOR] 
 Blair 
 I can not believe that daddy decided to stay Roman instead of having tea at the Carlow with me! The ER doctor said he would make a full recovery. Everything is ruined. 
 Eleanor 
 Why would you say that? You and I had a marvelous time. 
 Blair 
 Ah, I'm sorry, mother, it's just not the same. I don't understand how that French fox stole my father and your husband and always seems to come of like a... an innocent lamb. 
 Eleanor 
 Roman was not always so innocent, you know. 
 Blair 
 Really? What's his story? 
 Eleanor 
 Oh, when I first met him he was going out this model named Freddy. And Freddy was a horrible scoundrel. 
 Blair 
 Roman would actually be into somebody like that? 
 Eleanor 
 Into him? He was absolutely infatuated with him. Freddy had him under some kind of spell. I was the one who got him to break out of it and turn his life around. Don't mention Freddy to your father: It is a sore sentiment. 
 Blair 
 Ok. What was Freddy's last name? 
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - Rufus gets home, Alison is wrapping presents] 
 Alison 
 Hey, where were you? I tried to call you but your phone was off. 
 Rufus 
 I kept your date for you... with Alex. He is actually a pretty cool guy... other than the fact that he is in love with my wife. He told me about your phone call. 
 Alison 
 He felt that I owed him and explanation and he was right. 
 Rufus 
 And you didn't tell me that because... 
 Alison 
 ... because there was nothing to tell. I told Alex that I was back with my family and to stop calling. 
 Rufus 
 Would you have come back... if Jenny wouldn't have shown up to bring you? 
 Alison 
 If I hadn't... would Lily be here right now? 
 Rufus 
 I guess by turning our backs on these other people we thought we could fix ourselves. 
 Alison 
 Maybe other people aren't the problem. Maybe we changed. 
 Rufus 
 And at what point do we admit that no matter how much we want it or how hard we try... 
 Alison 
 ... it's just now working. 
 [INT COFFEE SHOP - Dan is sitting with Jenny who is at her laptop] 
 Dan 
 I know it's been maybe ten minutes since I last asked but you still sure you don't want to talk about it? 
 Jenny 
 Dad said he wouldn't want to ruin christmas. That's what I'm trying to do. 
 Dan 
 Hey, well, just in case you change your mind... 
 Jenny 
 ... you're here. I know. Ok, what about this? 
 [Jenny shows Dan a website: Gourmet Cheese of the Month $600] 
 Jenny 
 Seems like something Serena doesn't have. 
 Dan 
 A year of cheese for §600? Are these people kidding? I could buy a cow for that much money and make my own cheese. 
 Jenny 
 You just said 'Make my own cheese'. That's disgusting! 
 Dan 
 I'm never gonna find this gift for Serena. 
 Jenny 
 Yeah, and your gift must be especially good this year to make up for the rest of her christmas. 
 Dan 
 What do you mean? 
 Jenny 
 She is living in a hotel. You know, how homy can it be? It's not exactly festive. Erik told me they don't even allow trees. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair is sittin on her bed in front of her laptop, she tries to call Chuck but only gets his voicemail 
 Chuck 
 Leave a message and I may listen it. 
 Blair 
 Chuck, you are not answering my calls... to torture me, I am sure, but please for the love of god do not tell anybody about us. Ok, please? Please. 
 [Serena walks in, Blair hangs up quickly] 
 Serena 
 Hey, you told me to come right a way. Is everything alright? 
 Blair 
 Yeah. 
 Serena 
 Why aren't you with your dad? 
 Blair 
 Eh, I need your login for your agency's site from your modeling days. 
 Serena 
 My modeling days? I did one print-ad for GAP when I was twelve. What... are you holding an open call or something? 
 Blair 
 I have one specific look in mind. 
 Serena 
 Ah, ok, I don't know if I'm still in here but... 
 [Serena enters her login information] 
 Serena 
 Well, look at that. 
 Blair 
 Addresses and phone numbers... perfect. Now, I called you an hour ago, btw, you're late. 
 Serena 
 Uhm, you're lucky I'm even here now. It's christmas eve and I still haven't found a gift for Dan. Now all the stores are closing and I'm totally screwed. Do you have any idea what you can buy for under §50 these days? 
 Blair 
 I don't know, uhm, a single entré at a mid-priced restaurant? Three quarters of a DVD box set? Maybe a pair of Woolford stockings? 
 Serena 
 Ah, stockings! Yes, great idea for Dan! Blair, please, this is serious. 
 Blair 
 I don't know... why don't you buy him a gold Ligne 21 De Cartier, resides $4999. He won't now the difference. 
 [Blair makes a call] 
 Serena 
 What are you doing anyway? 
 Blair 
 I'm booking me a model. 
 [Blair looks at a website: look book model mangagement, Freddy Parens, 28, 6'1'', New York, Agent: Peltzer, Phone: 212.555.0101, Address: 303 East 88th St., New York NY 10128] 
 [INT COFFEE SHOP - Serena walks towards Vanessa] 
 Serena 
 Hey. I come to you head in hand, tail between my legs and off my high horse. I spend the entire day searching for the perfect gift for Dan. Now, all the stores are closing and christmas day is looming and, uhm, I need your help. 
 Vanessa 
 I could take this opportunity to gloat but I actually like you. So, let's get down to business. What do you have so far? 
 Serena 
 Uhm, I found a first edition J.R. Hall book, original Italian poster of 'The 400 Blows' and a Mont Blanc Fountain Pen. 
 Vanessa 
 All very thoughtful. 
 Serena 
 And all exceed §50. 
 Vanessa 
 Right. Well, Dan's not really that into things. 
 Serena 
 Which makes shopping for him kind of hopeless. The only thing he wants for christmas is snow. It's not like I could give him that. 
 Vanessa 
 You sure? 
 [Vanessa put on her jacket and they walk out] 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Eleanor's christmas party takes place, Models in pink outfits are walking through the crowd, giving away presents, Eleanor greets some guests] 
 Eleanor 
 Welcome! Welcome! Hey, I don't know... we've done everything a little untraditional this year. 
 [She leads them to the christmas tree] 
 Eleanor 
 I don't know if you've heard I'm designing a line of lingerie for Victoria Secret. I walked into the store and I fell in love with this tree. 
 [She points at an ornatment on the ree which is little boxes of lipstick] 
 Eleanor 
 Isn't the lipstick clever, mmh? Have some egg nog! 
 [Lily answers her cell phone] 
 Lily 
 Hello? 
 Rufus 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Lily 
 Hey. 
 [EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Rufus is sitting on the fire escape] 
 Rufus 
 So, uhm, running into each othe at the school fare... kinda awkard. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS] 
 Lily 
 I suppose so. Especially after our last phone call. Rufus, we really shouldn't be speaking. 
 [EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS] 
 Rufus 
 No, I know. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS] 
 Lily 
 But if there's something you wanna say you should go ahead and say it. 
 [EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS] 
 Rufus 
 Is there something you want me to say? 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS] 
 Lily 
 Rufus, why are you calling? 
 [EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS] 
 Rufus 
 Oh, I... just wanted to say: Merry christmas. Hope you have a good holiday. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS] 
 Lily 
 Yes, well, I'm... uhm, flying to Anguella with Bart tonight, so I'm expecting it to be... a great holiday... one for the ages, in fact. Good night, Rufus. Goodbye... 
 [Lily hangs up] 
 Lily 
 ... and good luck. What's the matter with me? 
 [Jack enters, carrying a present, Eleanor is talking to a party guest] 
 Eleanor 
 ... I don't think so. 
 [She sees Jack] 
 Eleanor 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 [She walks over to him] 
 Eleanor 
 What are you doing here? 
 Jack 
 I was hoping to see you again. I thought a great good furtune that Roman track me down at the skating rink and... extended an invitation. 
 [He hands her the present] 
 Eleanor 
 Oh, well... enjoy the party. 
 [She walks away and gives the present to the maid, she then confronts Roman who is walking on crutches] 
 Eleanor 
 How dare you inviting strange men into my home! 
 Roman 
 Jack came? 
 [Roman looks around and waves at Jack who raises his glass in response] 
 Roman 
 Go talk to him. Bring vodka. 
 Eleanor 
 Roman, you practically picked him up off the street. 
 Roman 
 And then I googled him: His name is Jack Roth, he owns a prominent hedge fund with offices in London and Barcelona... and he finds you very attractive. 
 Eleanor 
 Well, that's no... excuse. And... and I'm doing just fine without your romantic help. 
 Roman 
 Are you? 
 Eleanor 
 Mmh? 
 Roman 
 Eleanor, we've been friends for a long time... since before Marc Jacobs went into rehab. 
 Eleanor 
 Friends don't steal other friends' husbands. 
 [Eleanor walks away] 
 [Blair is talking on her cell phone] 
 Blair 
 Is Nate there?... Oh, a few hours ago?... A Chuck Bass didn't called for him, did he?... Ah, nevermind... Did Nate say where he was going?... No, no, don't disturb Misses Archibald, uhm, I'm sure he's on his way here now. Alright, thank you. 
 
 
 
 [BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Serena and Erik are sitting on Blair's bed, cutting silhouettes out of paper, Vanessa is sitting on the comforter with a laptop in her lap, Blair walks in] 
 Blair 
 Doherta is gonna kill you if you get glow on that comforter. 
 Serena 
 Sorry, we've turned your room into an art studio, B. But the clock is ticking. 
 Vanessa 
 I'm done. 
 [Vanessa shows them something on the laptop] 
 Erik 
 Wow. 
 Serena 
 Oh gosh. Wow, this... this is amazing. Thank you so much, Vanessa. This is gonna be incredible. 
 Vanessa 
 Good, I'm glad I could help. I think he'll really love it. 
 Blair 
 Vanessa, I think I'd like to help with this little project. Would you come and help me find another pair of scissors? 
 [Blair leads Vanessa into the bathroom, she closes the door behind her and picks up a pair of scissors] 
 Blair 
 It's so nice what you are doing for your friend Dan. Helping his girlfriend make his christmas present. Serena is so greatful because... she likes to see the best in people. I like to see the truth. 
 Vanessa 
 Yeah? And what's that? 
 Blair 
 I think you like Dan a little too much. Just thought I should let you know someone's watching. Merry christmas. 
 [Vanessa walks out of the bathroom] 
 Vanessa 
 I'm taking off. Call me when you're done. 
 Serena 
 Ok, where are you going? 
 [Vanessa walks out of the room withou answering, Blair comes back from the bathroom too] 
 Blair 
 I'm gonna go check on my daddy. 
 Erik 
 I thought you were gonna help? 
 Blair 
 I think my help is done here. 
 [Lily walks in] 
 Lily 
 Oh, hello! 
 Blair 
 Hi! 
 [Blair leaves] 
 Lily 
 Goodbye. 
 [Lily turns to Serena and Erik] 
 Lily 
 When you two are done hiding up here I'm taking you both out to dessert. 
 Serena 
 Mom, I'm busy. 
 Lily 
 But this is important for our family! It'll be just the three of us. 
 Serena 
 Mom, any time you say it'll be just the three of us it means you're dating someone new. Whoever it is, I don't care. I won't see him anyway. 
 Lily 
 Fine, fine. Then I'll just tell you who it is because you're gonna seeing him around from now on. It's Bart Bass. 
 Serena and Erik 
 Bart Bass? 
 Serena 
 Mom, you can not date Bart Bass! 
 Lily 
 You just said a moment ago you didn't care who it was! 
 Serena 
 That was before I knew who it was. 
 Erik 
 He only has one facial expression: He scares me. 
 Serena 
 And he raised Chuck: That scares me. 
 Lily 
 Oh, Serena, as usual you're being overly dramatic. I'm not marrying Bart. This is very casual. And regardless, I'm not asking your permission. 
 [Lily leaves, Serena and Erik look at each other] 
 [EXT NEW YORK - Dan and Jenny are carrying a christmas tree down the street] 
 Jenny 
 You know, when I suggested this plan I didn't know that it would entail robbery. 
 Dan 
 Hey, hey! I left a donation. So it was more of a rescue than a robbery. You know, those abandoned trees would just be kicking it after christmas. And this tree we have here will be loved and admired. 
 Jenny 
 Well, you have a real talent for spinning, my brother. Ok... 
 [Jenny puts her end of the tree on the side-walk, Dan does too] 
 Dan 
 I wish you had more talent for heavy lifting. 
 Jenny 
 Well, what you are doing for Serena is really romantic. I wonder what mom and dad are getting each other for christmas. 
 [Dan stares at Jenny] 
 Jenny 
 I thought that if I brought them under the same roof that things would go back the way they were. They haven't, have they? 
 Dan 
 I think there's a real possibility that they might split up. 
 Jenny 
 If I hadn't... brought her back though, we could've just kept pretending that she's just in Hudson doing her art. 
 [Dan hugs her] 
 Dan 
 You did the right thing, Jen. Really, you did. 'Cause what happens now... at least we're not living a fantasy, you know. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Blair is lying on the couch texting, Eleanor takes one of the presents the models hand out and helps herself to another glass of champagne] 
 Party Guest 
 Wonderful party, Eleanor. 
 [Eleanor walks over to Jack] 
 Eleanor 
 So, you ice skate. 
 Jack 
 Well, occasionally... with my niece. But she's much more talented than I am. 
 Eleanor 
 Here. 
 [She hands him the present] 
 Eleanor 
 I haven't skated since... ages... but I used to love it when I was a girl. 
 Jack 
 You must be very beautiful out there on the ice. 
 [The elevator doors open and Freddy, Roman's ex-boyfriend, enters, he gets a glass of champagne, he bumps into one of the guests] 
 Freddy 
 Excuse me. 
 [He greets some other guests in passing] 
 Freddy 
 Merry christmas. 
 [Eleanor spots him] 
 Eleanor 
 Excuse me. 
 [She walks over to him] 
 Eleanor 
 Freddy, what on earth are you doing here? 
 Freddy 
 Roman invited me. 
 Eleanor 
 What? [Harold notices Freddy too, Roman limps towards him too] 
 Roman 
 Freddy, what... what are you doing here? 
 Eleanor 
 He said that you invited him. 
 Roman 
 What? 
 [Blair watches the scene from the couch] 
 Harold 
 Freddy! Roman, explain this. 
 Roman 
 I can't. 
 Freddy 
 It's so true. How does one explain the undescribable pull to see an old lover, to feel that jolt of electricity. 
 Harold 
 You couldn't last two days in town without contacting him! 
 Roman 
 I can't believe you trust appearances and not me! 
 [Roman limps away] 
 Eleanor 
 Harold, dear, Roman did not invite Freddy. I think Blair did. 
 Harold 
 Blair? 
 [Harold and Eleanor both look at Blair] 
 Eleanor 
 Freddy, if you want to be the featured model in my spring catalogue you better tell us the truth. 
 Freddy 
 She might have offered to buy me a cruise... and renew my gym membership. 
 Eleanor 
 Well, you might as well take that cruise because you will be featured in my catalogue when hell freezes over. Now, please, get out. 
 Freddy 
 Thanks for the champagne. 
 Eleanor 
 Merry christmas. 
 [Freddy walks off, Harold and Eleanor turn back to Blair] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Looks like daddy's little girl isn't sugar and spice and everything nice after all. 
 [Eleanor leads Harold away from the other guests] 
 Eleanor 
 I'd wish you would just slow down for a second and let her be. 
 Harold 
 I just can't understand why Blair would do something so cruel! And to Roman... who was only completely kind to her. 
 Eleanor 
 It isn't Roman Blair is lashing out at... it's you. She was hoping for spending time with you all alone... and then you show up at her doorstep... with your lover. Without a word of warning! How did you expect her to react? 
 Harold 
 Well, I hoped that when we were together we would all... work out. I suppose that was pretty naive. 
 Eleanor 
 Blair learned scheming from her mother and unrealistic dreaming from her father. She tries really hard to act all grown up but don't you be fooled... she's still a little girl... who needs her daddy. 
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan and Jenny carry the christmas tree towards the hotel] 
 Jenny 
 Ok, stop, stop, stop! 
 [They put the tree down, both are breathing heavily, Dan stretches his back] 
 Jenny 
 Ok, what now? 
 Dan 
 Now you go in there, you distract Dexter, the humourless concierge... 
 Jenny 
 Right. 
 Dan 
 ... while I try to sneak this into an elevator. 
 Jenny 
 Alright. 
 [Dan tries to lift the tree by himself] 
 Jenny 
 who is gonna turn you into Hercules? You can't carry this thing by yourself. 
 Dan 
 I... I did not say the plan was foolproof. 
 Jenny 
 Yeah. 
 [Lily walks up to them] 
 Dan 
 Eh, Miss van der Woodsen... eh, Lily! Hi! 
 Lily 
 Dan, Jenny... 
 Jenny 
 Hi! 
 Lily 
 ... tree! 
 Dan 
 Yeah, ehm, they don't allow christmas trees inside... which is why we're out here... 
 Jenny 
 ... which is why Dan is about to ask you for a favour. 
 Lily 
 Ah, does it involve distracting Dexter and sneaking into the elevator? 
 Dan 
 Why, would that work? 
 Lily 
 No, never. He has the eyes of a hawk and he takes his job very seriously. 
 Dan 
 So I've noticed. 
 Lily 
 But Bobby at the service entrance... I think he can be bought. 
 [Dan and Jenny smile] 
 Lily 
 Come! 
 [INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY - Serena and Vanessa are standing between some big boxes, Serena is texting] 
 Serena 
 I just send him a text and Dan is on his way. Thank you so much. 
 Vanessa 
 It's really no problem... and since there are no problems I should go. 
 [Vanessa grabs her jacket and purse] 
 Serena 
 Oh, no, no, no, stay! Please! 
 Vanessa 
 You don't need me. We talked about how to turn everything on. 
 Serena 
 No, I know I can do it but I just want you to see Dan's face. 
 Vanessa 
 I really got to get going. 
 Serena 
 Ok, well, I'll tell him how much you did. 
 Vanessa 
 Please, don't. It's your present... just... enjoy your night. 
 [Vanessa walks out but turns around for a moment, she looks back and sees Serena all excited, she then walks off] 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair tries to call Nate but she only reaches his voicemail] 
 Nate 
 Hey, this is Nate. I can't come... 
 [Blair hangs up, her father knocks on the open door and enters] 
 Harold 
 May I come in? Our flight leaves in a few hours and I wanted to say goodbye. 
 [He walks over to her bed and sits down next to her] 
 Harold 
 Please forgive me, Blair. I should have told you I was bringing Roman. I know that having him here would be hard for you but I love you so much and I love Roman and I was hoping if we were all thrown together that... something... perfect would happen and that you would love him too. 
 Blair 
 I was gonna convince you to move back to New York but... you bought a vineyard... in France... with Roman. What's next? The commitment ceremony? 
 [Harold nods his head slightly] 
 Blair 
 Great! There is no room in your life for me anymore. 
 Harold 
 Sweetheart, there is always room for you. No matter where I am, no matter who I'm with. 
 [He kisses her on the forehead] 
 Harold 
 Now, here... 
 [He pulls out a wrapped CD from behind his back] 
 Harold 
 ... this is part of your christmas gift. 
 [Blair and Harold are looking at the photos on the CD on her laptop: a vineyard, a swimming pool, an old house] 
 Blair 
 Your house in France. It's very nice, daddy. I'm sure you and Roman will totally enjoy it. 
 Harold 
 And so will you... because this... is your room. 
 Blair 
 It's beautiful. 
 [There's a picture of a bedroom: the room is flooded with light, a big bed with white sheets, a wooden desk and a chair are standing at the end of the bed and there is a picture of Audrey Hepurn hanging over the bed] 
 Harold 
 We had it decorated just for you. 
 [There's a picture of Roman holding a cat] 
 Blair 
 A cat! 
 Harold 
 A cat... named Cat... like in your favourite movie. It was Roman's idea. So, merry christmas, sweetheart. I hope you're gonna spend the whole summer with us. 
 [Blair smiles] 
 [INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY - A video is projected onto the walls: a forest covered in snow, it is snowing, there are ventilators which blow artificial snow into the gallery, Dan enters and sees Serena sitting on a mattress in the middle of the room] 
 Serena 
 Merry christmas! Do you like it? Do you think it's cheesy? 
 Dan 
 No, no, no, it's incredible. How did you do this? 
 Serena 
 Well, I had help from my elves. 
 [Dan sits down next to Serena] 
 Dan 
 Your present is waiting for you at home but, ehm, I did bring a little pre-present for you. 
 [Dan hands her a folded pack of papers, she unfolds them: 10-8-05, I was accidentially invited to a birthday party. I met a girl there. She spoke two sentences to me. And I never forgot her. Her name was Serena and she was the most beautiful girl I ever met. Excited and keen about the whole thing she could have got started again if it hadn't been for her enthusiasm and hard work. He was an enourmous help to her. She was detailed by the Commitee to live on a farm. He showed me a card which stated he was a communicant by the church. I replied. I should make inquieries as to whether the tears freed him. Her house was situated in the middle of the plantations on the slope or a mill with paired paddocks at the side and there were good...] 
 Serena 
 Hey, this is your story. 
 Dan 
 It's the original. It is right out of the spiral notebook. 
 Serena 
 I'm kinda scared to read it. What happened on October 8th, 2005? 
 Dan 
 Ehm, well, I was accidentially invited to a birthday perty... where I met a girl. She only spoke two sentences to me but I've never forgotten her. 
 Serena 
 Wait, your story is about me? 
 [Dan nods slightly and then leans in to kiss her, Serena loosens one strap of her dress and then the other] 
 Dan 
 Are we really gonna do this? 
 Serena 
 Yeah. 
 [They kiss again and lie down, a look through the skylight shows the night sky, it is snowing outside] 
 [EXT NEW YORK - It's the next morning and it's still snowing] 
 [INT THE HUMPRHEY'S ART GALLERY - Dan and Serena are lying naked under the sheets] 
 Dan 
 Hey, your crafts were impressive but... how did you manage the real snow? 
 Serena 
 I'm well connected. 
 Dan 
 This is without question the best christmas ever. 
 Serena 
 Ever. Merry christmas. 
 Dan 
 I hate to break the spell but, eh, we better get home before our families wake up. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDROFS - LIVING ROOM - Eleanor and Jack are coming down the stairs, Eleanor is wearing a nightgown and a satin bathrobe, Jack kisses her] 
 jack- Eleanor, you're a marvel. 
 Eleanor 
 Oh god... 
 [He kisses her again] 
 Eleanor 
 If I knew there were men like you wandering around Central Park lost. 
 [Harold and Roman enter with their bags in hand] 
 Eleanor 
 Oh! 
 Harold 
 Eleanor, good morning. And Jack, nice to see you. 
 jack- Good morning. 
 Roman 
 Yes, wonderful. 
 Harold 
 The flights were all cancelled because of the weather. I wanted to tell Blair in person. Do not worry, we... we have a room at The Pierre. 
 Eleanor 
 No, it's nonsense. You'll... stay with us. 
 Harold 
 Thank you. 
 [Eleanor walks Jack to the elevator] 
 Eleanor 
 So, call me later? 
 jack- Oh, yes. 
 Eleanor 
 I'll be spending christmas with my family. 
 jack- Bye. 
 [Jack enters the elevator and leaves, Blair comes down the stairs] 
 Blair 
 What's going on? 
 Harold 
 We're back for christmas. 
 Blair 
 Well, Roman, you are in for a treat because a Waldorf christmas is like no other. 
 [Blair touches Roman's arm, Eleanor takes Harold's hand] 
 Eleanor 
 Come on, you. 
 [Harold kisses her hand] 
 Eleanor 
 Oh! 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Serena enters and finds a christmas tree in the suite, it is decorated with a chain of lights and a big red ribbon on top] 
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - Dan comes home, Rufus is making breakfast] 
 Dan 
 Merry christmas, dad! You're up early. 
 Rufus 
 And you are getting in awefully late. 
 Dan 
 Oh, yeah. Well, I left you a message. 
 Rufus 
 Saying the tree-shenanigans were taking all night... but I didn't think you meant literally all night. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, the tree... it was a big production. Luckily, Serena's mom was there to help with the plan. 
 Rufus 
 Lily was there? I thought you mentioned she was out of the country. 
 Dan 
 No, no, they're here. They're gonna see the Nutcracker tomorrow. 
 [Jenny and Alison enter] 
 Jenny 
 Do I smell chocolate chip waffles? 
 Rufus 
 With hot caramel sauce! 
 Alison 
 You're father's christmas specialty. 
 Jenny 
 Dan, pass the chocolate chips. 
 [Dan hands her the bowl] 
 Dan 
 Good morning. 
 Jenny 
 Good morning. 
 Rufus 
 After breakfast and presents I need to go to the gallery... take care of some stuff. 
 Jenny 
 On christmas morning? 
 Rufus 
 Well, yeah, you know... work never sleeps. 
 Alison 
 But, you know, the three of us can hang out together. It will be great: We will drink hot coco and watch a movie and then when your dad comes back we'll all go for a walk. 
 [EXT NEW YORK - It is still snowing] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Hear those silver bells? It is christmas time in the city. Some families actually do make the yule time gay... managing to leave their troubles far away. 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Harold, Roman, Eleanor, Blair and Doherta are all sitting together unwrapping gifts, Blair is trying on a new coat] 
 Blair 
 Oh, it's beautiful! Thank you, thank you! 
 Roman 
 You look like a brunette Catherine Deneuve. Elle est manifique. 
 Blair 
 It is so gorgeous! 
 [Harold takes a new sweater out of a parcel, Eleanor is drinking champagne and eating strawberries, Doherta is opening her parcel, it contains a blackberry] 
 Blair 
 Merry christmas, Doherta. So we can text. Do you like it? 
 Doherta 
 Thank you, Miss Blair. 
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - Dan, Jenny and Alison are unwrapping presents] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Other families have a merry little christmas even when their troubles aren't so far away. 
 Dan 
 So, what did dad have to do at the gallery exactly? 
 Alison 
 Eh, paper work, I think. 
 Jenny 
 You are going back to Hudson, aren't you? 
 Alison 
 Yeah. But hey, we are going to be ok. Come here. 
 [Alison hugs Jenny] 
 Dan 
 We know. It's alright.

 I know how you like Florida. 
 Erik 
 Yeah, wow, Eh, number one fan! You know, I'm sorry I didn't get anything for you, Mister Bass, but eh, I didn't know you would be coming for christmas. 
 Bart 
 Ah, no worries, Erik. Please, call me Bart. 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 But some gifts are for keeps. 
 [Serena gets up and gives Erik his present] 
 Serena 
 For you! 
 Erik 
 Thank you. 
 Bart 
 Erik, Serena, I just want you to know that I have deep feelings for your mother. 
 [Lily's cell phone starts ringing] 
 Serena 
 Mom, your phone. 
 Bart 
 Eh, Lily, you're not wanna interupt this moment. 
 [Lily rejects the call and Bart sits down next to her, he takes a small box out of his pocket] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Other presents come when you least expect them. 
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Rufus is standing in front of the hotel, he isn't wearing a jacket and he shivers, he leaves Lily a message] 
 Rufus 
 Hey, Lil. You know, everything is closed on christmas. Diners that claim to be open for 24/7... it's false advertising. 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Bart is getting down on one knee and opens the box, it contains a diamond ring] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 And everyone knows the biggest present comes in the smallest box. 
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Rufus is still on the phone] 
 Rufus 
 So, eh, Alison is leaving. She is spending time alone with the kids. And I seemed to have walked all the way from Brooklyn to your doorstep... without a jacket... in the snow. So, what the hell... I miss you... and I've been missing you for a while. 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Lily stares at the ring, Serena and Erik look at each other]

 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Then there are those boxes you wish you had never opened. 
 [Blair looks at the second new message: It's a photo of Chuck hugging Nate on a beach] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Have a holly jolly christmas. XOXO Gossip Girl.
