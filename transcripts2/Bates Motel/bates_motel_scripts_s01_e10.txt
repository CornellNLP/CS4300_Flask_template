 Previously on  Bates Motel... 
 So when can you sneak me into my dad's office? 
 I wanna get some of his stuff, if it's still there. 
 They're from a woman-- B. 
 "All my love, B." 
 Who's B? 
 You and I, we're together, right? 
 I shouldn't have done it with someone like you. 
 I don't think you're a nice girl. 
 Zack Shelby owed me $150,000. 
 Where is it? 
 Where is what? 
 [Gasps] 
 I need you to bring me that money tomorrow night at the Seacliff Pier at midnight. 
 Can you bring me my money? 
 Yes. 
 I need to speak to Sheriff Romero right away, please. 
 It's a matter of life and death. 
 What is your name, please? 
 Are you kidding me? You don't know my name? 
 Norma Louise Bates. 
 We need to talk. 
 He told me to show up with $150,000 at midnight at the docks. 
 Okay. And what did you say? 
 I said yes, I would bring him the money. 
 I mean, he had a gun to my neck. 
 I don't have the money. 
 I don't know anything about the money. 
 [Quietly] Okay. 
 All right. I'll take care of it. 
 So what, I'm just supposed to accept that you will "take care of it," whatever that means? 
 Yes, that's right. 
 You need to trust me. 
 Trust-- that is hard to do. I'm the one who was supposed to show up with money that I know nothing about, or he's gonna kill my sons and me. 
 I mean, pardon me for being a little concerned about what your plan is. 
 No harm is gonna come to you or your sons. 
 You have my word. 
 That's comforting. 
 Yep. 
 [Door shuts] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 You look kind of pathetic. 
 Really? 
 I was just thinking how glad I am I don't have to get all dressed up and go. 
 What a pain. 
 You should go. 
 No one invited me. 
 And I know that doesn't do anything for my pathetic quotient. 
 Do you want me to go with you? 
 No. 
 No, that's silly. 
 That's more than silly. 
 That's tragically lame. 
 Oh, I don't mind. 
 I'd like to. 
 Oh, please. You're just asking me because I'm friend and you feel sorry for me. 
 Well, yeah. 
 Okay, jerk-off, I'll go with you. 
 [Water running] 
 Here's some French toast left. 
 [Exhales] 
 I need a gun. 
 Can you get me a gun and teach me how to use it? 
 No. 
 What the hell do you need a gun for? 
 [Sighs] Man. 
 Abernathy thinks that I'm meeting him at the dock at midnight with 150 grand. 
 That's what this is about, the dead body and everything. 
 He thinks I have the money, but I don't. 
 So, you know, I tell Romero. 
 And you know what he says? 
 "I'll take care of it." 
 That's it, nothing else. 
 Nothing like how that's gonna happen. 
 Nothing to make me feel safe. 
 I think that he is bad, just like everyone else around here. 
 I don't trust him. I don't trust anyone. 
 Oh, come on, Norma. 
 Dylan, please. 
 Please, please, please. Get me a gun. 
 Teach me how to use it. 
 I just wanna feel like I can defend myself. 
 I'm sorry...okay? 
 You and a gun is a bad idea. 
 [Tense music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Ooh! Sorry. 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Screw off, shithead! 
 Good morning, Dr. Kurata. 
 Oh, hello. 
 It's our session time, right? 
 Um, you cancelled last week and never called to reschedule. 
 [Sighs] 
Oh, I'm-- there's just so much going on. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Um, can you do it now? 
 Um... 
[Exhales] okay. 
 Where's Norman? 
 He's already at school. 
 Ah. Hmm. 
 Well, please, come in. 
 Thank you. 
 I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to handle stress. 
 [Chuckles nervously] 
 Why are you feeling stress, Norma? 
 [Inhales] 
 Mm. 
 Just...stuff. 
 Like, normal life stuff. 
 How has everything been going with Norman? 
 It's fine. 
 Fine--you know, Norman's such a good boy. 
 He's not really why I'm here. 
 Not quite a boy though, is he? 
 Yeah, I-I guess he is getting bigger, yeah. 
 Is it gonna be hard for you when he leaves? 
 When he leaves to go where? 
 College? 
 Oh, right. Um... well, you know, he'll probably just go locally, given our money and all. 
 Hmm. 
 [Pen scratching] 
 Let me ask you this. 
 When you were a little girl, is this what you thought parenting would be like? 
 When I was a little girl? 
 When I was a little girl, um... yeah, I don't know. I don't remember. 
 Do you remember anything about being little? 
 Yeah. Well, yeah, sure, yeah. 
 But just, like, normal, usual stuff. 
 Well, what were your parents like? 
 [Deep breath] 
 My dad was very kind. 
 You know, just like the kind of guy who would smile at you all the time, no matter what, you know? 
 You'd--you would feel like he would just take care of everything. 
 Um, my mom... um, she worked in a bakery. 
 Um, she always smelled like cookies. 
 Your parents are gone now? 
 Yeah, they're both gone. 
 Do you have any siblings? 
 No. I am an only child. 
 [Moans softly] 
 [Whispers] 
Oh, I don't feel well. 
 Oh, it's my stomach. 
 I'm sorry. You know what? 
 I'm just gonna have to reschedule. 
 I'm sorry about that. 
 Norma, are you okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. 
 I just need to go home. 
 Why do you keep calling me? 
 I told you, I don't have anything else to say to you. 
 Just stop bothering me! 
 I said leave me alone. 
 You can't say that to me. Are you k-- 
 [voice shaking] 
Eric, don't call me again. 
 You hear me? Don't call me again! 
 And I mean it! 
[Sniffles] 
 [Panting] 
 Are you all right? 
 [Gasps] 
 Norman. 
 Norman, did you hear anything that I was saying? 
 No, not really. No. 
 Well, if you did, please-- please just forget it. 
 Uh, I was just coming to tell you I definitely don't wanna try and publish my story. 
 Wha--uh, because of your mother? 
 I just don't want to. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I-- 
 I understand. 
 Um, please don't tell anyone about today. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I guess this means that we have a secret now, huh? 
 You'll keep it for me, won't you? 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Sighs] 
 Alex. 
 I haven't seen you since my brother's service. 
 A bit weird-- nothing to bury but a hand. 
 Whatever. 
 What the hell brings you to my-- 
 What happened to your face? 
 I don't remember. 
 Okay. We're getting off on the wrong track here. 
 It's not a social visit, Maggie. 
 I know you did the bookkeeping for your brother and Shelby's little business-- importing girls from Asia and selling them. 
 In fact, I've got all your paperwork. 
 It's nice and neat. 
 Did Jake Abernathy do this to you? 
 I don't know who that is. 
 I'm referring to your brother and Shelby's third partner. 
 You mean Joe Fioretti. 
 He drives a black Cadillac. 
 About 50, blondish hair-- 
 Yeah, that'd be him. 
 A few days ago, he came looking for some money that Shelby ow him. 
 I don't have it. 
 He said he was gonna kill me. 
 And I guess he finally believed me. 
 And how'd you contact Fioretti? 
 He always contacted us when a shipment was coming in. 
 So you have no way to reach him? 
 No. 
 Anything else? 
 Any idea where he is right now? 
 He told me he was running the same type of thing in four different ports up and down the coast. 
 All right. 
 What happens now? 
 To me. 
 Um, nothing, if you keep your mouth shut, or I'll be back. 
 Okay. 
 Take care of yourself, Maggie. 
 Hello, it's Norma Bates. Yeah, I know I just called, but I just wanna make sure that Sheriff Romero is still having the house patrolled, because I haven't seen a car go by in a while. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Yeah, just making sure. 
 Thank you. 
 Hi. Sorry I'm late. 
 I saw the cutest dress at the vintage store for the dance tonight. 
 You're going to a dance? 
 Yeah. 
 Norman's taking me. 
 Oh, when did that happen? 
 Today. 
 I hope that's okay. 
 Yeah, no, I'm glad he is. 
 I just didn't hear anything about it. 
 Well, anyway, tell me if you like this dress. 
 [Giggles] 
 I love it. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Will you--will you hold it up to you? 
 I wanna see how it looks with heels. 
 Oh, it looks amazing. 
 Is this a spot, or is it just the nap in the fabric? 
 Um, it's just the nap of the fabric. 
 It's, uh-- it's nothing. That's just an accident from childhood. 
 I spilled some hot chocolate on my leg. 
 That must've hurt. 
 Yeah, I don't know. It was a long time ago. 
 It was, like, in Florida in the old house. 
 I was two years old. 
 I love the dress! 
 [Truck approaching] 
 Hey. 
 I got something for you. 
 I changed my mind. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't make me regret this. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Come on. I'll teach you how to shoot it. 
 So first of all, you need to learn how to hold it properly, okay? 
 Now face the target. 
 Your feet spread shoulder-width apart, all right? 
 You'll have a good, stable base. 
 No, shoulder-width apart. 
 All right. 
 Okay, now, hands like this. 
 Okay. 
 Now gun all the way out, right? 
 Your arms locked. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I want you to aim at that big bottle on the right. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 'Cause you're gonna line up this bar here at the end of the barrel, right there on that notch. 
 Uh-huh. 
 And I'm gonna pull back the hammer. 
 [Gunshot] 
 I didn't say shoot! 
 Did I say shoot? 
 Well, I had the bottle in the sights. 
 You don't shoot until I tell you to shoot. 
 Well, why'd I miss? 
 Because it takes a while. 
 Are you gonna wait until I tell you to pull the trigger this time? 
 Okay! 
 Okay, yes. 
 So what kind of a job do you have that you're carrying a gun? 
 I guard stuff. 
 What kind of stuff? 
 Weed. Pot fields. 
 I don't like that! 
 [Scoffs] 
 Norma, do you see? 
 Do you see this right now? 
 What? 
 No, this is exactly why I didn't tell you. 
 [Sighs] 
 I-I don't need you passing judgment on me or anything that I do. 
 Okay, I am 22 years old. I'm an adult. 
 Eh, barely. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Who's not the adult? 
 I'm trying to teach you how to use a firearm, and you're doing whatever the hell you want. 
 [Scoffs] 
 This is serious sh1t! 
 Okay, okay. 
 I will follow your instructions, I promise. 
 I--okay. 
 [Sighs] Okay, get-- get in the right stance. 
 And then once you have a good aim... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I want you to squeeze the trigger. 
 Okay, don't-- don't yank on it. 
 Okay. 
 Just gently squeeze it, okay, mom? 
 [Gunshot] 
 Aah! 
 [Cackles] 
 Look at that. 
 Did you see that? 
 Son of a bitch. 
 You called me mom. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 You haven't done that in, like, I don't know how long. 
 Yeah, well, you have a loaded gun in your hand, Norma. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Crying] I'm so scared. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I know. 
 But from everything I hear, Romero's the man in this town. 
 Okay? So you're gonna have to trust him to do what he says. 
 I know that might be hard for you, but that's what you're gonna have to do. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gun clicks] 
 You're empty. 
 Load it. 
 
 
 
 Are you Norma Bates? 
 [Gasps] 
 How can I help you? 
 Um, I'm Maggie Summers. 
 My family used to own this place. 
 Oh. 
 Um, I came here to tell you something. 
 Yes? 
 If--if you have that money, give it up. 
 Look, I know this guy, the one you're calling Abernathy. 
 Me and my brother Keith worked with him. 
 He will kill you. 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Hey, Norman. 
 Hey. 
 Is Dylan here? 
 Dylan. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'll get him. 
 Oh, come in. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 This is the stuff from his desk. 
 Thank you for doing this. 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, I'm gonna go finish my homework. 
 It was really nice of you to do this for me. 
 It's no big deal. 
 At least you have it now. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm glad. 
 Oh, um, I forgot. 
 I also found this. 
 Oh, my dad's watch. 
 Thank you. 
 Anytime. 
 Even though we did almost get shot. 
 Yeah, that was crazy. 
 Okay. 
 Well, this is it. 
 I won't bug you anymore. 
 No, you can-- you can bug me. 
 It's fine. 
[Laughs] 
 You can bug me anytime. 
 Oh. 
 Mother! 
 What? 
 I need some black socks. 
 Well, did you check in your drawer? 
 Oh, it never occurred to me to look in my drawer. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, what am I supposed to do? 
 I can't go to this stupid dance wearing white socks with a suit! 
 Well, I don't know where your stupid black socks are! 
 It's not my fault you decided to go last minute to a dance! 
 What am I supposed to do, darn some socks? 
 I've got some black socks he can use. 
 Hmph. 
 Listen, mom's a little stressed out, so take it easy on her, okay? 
 Thanks for the tip. 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 You know, I was only helping Bradley because some of her dad's stuff was at work. 
 Yeah, whatever. 
 It doesn't matter to me. I'm over her. 
 If you want to go out with her, go for it. 
 I'm not going out with her. 
 No, but you want to. Who wouldn't? 
 [Chuckles] 
 This is a stupid conversation. 
 Yeah, all conversations are stupid. 
 Just "Blah, blah, blah," like rats trying to find our way out through a maze, like it has some purpose or meaning, but it doesn't. 
 Okay, now you're creeping me out. 
 Just do what you want as far as Bradley's concerned. 
 She probably likes you. You should ask her out. 
 I should. 
 Yes, you should. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm completely, 100% over her. 
 What time is Emma picking you up? 
 Soon. The dance starts at 8:00. 
 When is it over? 
 Midnight. 
 [Ticking] 
 [Breathing rapidly] 
 What is it? 
 Norman, can I tell you something that I've never told anybody? 
 You were never old enough before, but I-I think you are now. 
 Yeah. What? 
 I grew up in Akron, Ohio. 
 That's not what-- 
 I know. 
 I-I know I've said a lot of things, but this is the truth. 
 And I want someone to know the truth about me in this world, and I'd like that to be you, if you're okay with that. 
 Yeah, of course I am. 
 My brother used to make me have s*x with him... when I was, like, 13. 
 And it went on until he moved out. 
 Oh, I know I shouldn't have told you. 
 I shouldn't have told you. 
 It's just you're the person that I'm closest to in this world. 
 [Crying] 
 I understand, mother. 
 When I realized just how messed up that was, I couldn't tell anyone. 
 We had so much trouble. There was no money. 
 My mom was already checked out of her body. 
 My dad was insane. 
 He was so violent. 
 I knew that if I told my dad, he would kill my brother, so I never told. 
 One day, when my dad was supposed to be at work, my brother was doing things to me, and I heard the front door open and it was my dad, home unexpectedly. 
 And I was so scared that I jumped up so fast. 
 And the hot iron fell off the ironing board, and it hit my leg. 
 [Sniffling] 
 I'm so sorry, mother. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Sighs] 
 Anyway, you know, it-- it doesn't really matter, right? 
 It was a long time ago. 
 [Crying] 
 It's just that I want to tell some-- 
 I wanted someone to know this about me in case-- in case, um... oh, I don't know why. 
 I don't know why. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 [Door opens] 
 Hi. Is Norman ready? 
 Emma, you look beautiful. 
 Come on in. 
 Look at Emma! 
 Norman? 
 [Tonelessly] 
Wow, you look great. 
 You, too. 
 You ready to go? 
 [Laughs] 
 Okay. You two have fun. 
 You look so handsome. 
 Okay. Bye-bye. 
 [Phone vibrating] 
 Hello? 
 I just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten about our appointment at midnight. 
 No, I haven't. 
 Great. See you then.

 What do I call you? 
 Abernathy? Fioretti? 
 I go by a lot of different names. 
 Why don't you call me Joe? 
 All right, Joe. 
 What happened to the cute-but-nutty lady who runs the motel? 
 She's no longer involved. 
 You kill her? 
 Let's just say it's handled. 
 Is that for me? 
 I thought we could talk first, you know, come to an understanding. 
 About what? 
 Well, Joe, if you're gonna run a business in my town, I should know about it. 
 Was  running a business-- past tense. 
 Well, maybe that doesn't have to be the case. 
 You had the wrong partners. 
 Well, it wasn't like I could put an ad on Craigslist. 
 How'd you get my money? 
 Now, that's part of what you need to understand. 
 This is my town, Joe. 
 You want to keep your business going here, then you got to go through me. 
 We make a new deal. 
50-50. 
 That's more than Keith and Shelby got combined. 
 That's because they were idiots. 
 Going forward, you're paying me for certainty, for professionalism. 
 And to that end, Joe, I make all the decisions about who else in this town is involved. 
 That's it? 
 I put a cell number for you on a card. 
 It's in the bag. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Not in my town, you piece of sh1t. 
 [Distant splash] 
 You can go home now, Norma. 
 I almost shot you! 
 When I say "Trust me," trust me. 
 I made you some tea. 
 That's very nice of you. 
 Of course. 
 Let me clean up that eye. 
 [Grunts] 
 Okay? 
 You probably shouldn't tell anyone that you came here. 
 Don't worry. 
 Doesn't look bad. 
 I got most of the dirt out of it, anyway. 
 All right. 
 [Exhales] 
 I'm going to go change quickly. 
 Okay. 
 I'll drive you home. 
 Thanks. 
 What kind of a grown woman invites a teenage boy into her house and changes her clothes where he can see her?

 Of course it is. 
 No. No, no, she's trying to help me. 
 She's trying to seduce you. 
 That's not true. 
 Then why doesn't she close the door? 
 Because-- 
 Because she knows you're watching her. 
 She does not! 
 Of course she does. 
 She wants you to see her body. 
 She wants you to want her. 
 Stop!
