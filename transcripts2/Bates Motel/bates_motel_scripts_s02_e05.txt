 Previously on Bates Motel... 
 Zane Morgan, I think you might have forgotten how things work around here. 
 I can be a real nice guy till I break you. 
 Sheriff! 
 Hold on a second. Yeah? 
 You got to get over to your house right away. 
 [Siren wails, horn blares] 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Excuse me. 
 I just haven't met anyone else against the bypass and also who seems to know how things work in this town. 
 Give me a call. 
 Hey, I'm looking for Norma Bates. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm her brother. 
 My brother Caleb was here. 
 What? 
 She's lying! Can't you see that? 
 Norman, stop it! 
 He can't help it! It's his dad! 
 Caleb is his dad. 
 You had s*x with my mother. Did you know I was your son? 
 You need to be strong. You need to put this behind you. 
 I can't put this behind me. It's me. 
 I came here to tell you that I remember what you did to me, you son of a bitch! 
 Don't lie again! 
 Norman, it's me, Cody. Can you hear me? 
 [Insects chirping] 
 Norman? 
 Norman? 
 [Whispering] Norman. 
 Hey. 
 You're back. 
 I didn't want to drop you off until I was sure you were okay. 
 What happened? 
 You were about a mile east of Eagle Creek. 
 You were just in a coffee shop down the road just zoning out. 
 The manager called me, so here we are. 
 Call... why... why would they... why would they call you? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Do you remember anything? 
 I've never seen anyone go into a hole like that. 
 I mean, you were, like, not there. 
 You take something? 
 No, I... no, I didn't. 
 Okay. 
 Has anything like this ever happened to you before? 
 Never. 
 Did anyone call my mother? 
 [Scoffs] No, they just called me. 
 They had no one else to call. 
 Well, please don't tell her. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, no, she'll just worry and, uh... 
 You never have to worry about me telling sh... to parents. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Seagulls crying] 
 [Boat horn blares in the distance] 
 [Gasps] What the hell? 
 What? 
 Why are you sleeping here? 
 What are you doing, man? 
 I'm trying to be unconscious. 
 Why are you pouring water on me? 
 See the 2,000 texts right here, all from me? 
 What's the crisis? 
 Someone set Romero's house on fire last night. 
 [Sighs] What? 
 Yeah, it's major. 
 Are you sure it wasn't an accident? 
 Word is, it was set. Hmm. 
 Now, who do you think would be crazy nuts enough to mess with Romero? 
 Huh? 
 Anyone particular come to mind? 
 [Sighs, sniffs] 
 What are we gonna do? 
 [Sighs] You tell me. 
 You're the boss. 
 Morning. 
 Hi, honey. Sit down. I'm making scrambled eggs. 
 Have you talked to Dylan yet? 
 Dylan moved out. 
 How do you mean? 
 He moved out. He's not gonna live here anymore. 
 What kind of toast do you want, sweetie? 
 Shouldn't we go after him? 
 Shouldn't we try and do something? 
 There's nothing we can do! 
 Okay, mother. 
 It's you and me, Norman. 
 It's always been you and me, and we have to move on. 
 [Crackling electricity] 
 [Keys clacking] 
 [Car engine turns off] 
 Why are you here? 
 Might want to rework your greeting for your guests. 
 Need a room. 
 Why do you need a room? 
 [Sighs] 
 Need a credit card, right? 
 What happened? 
 Can we just check me in? 
 I really don't want to talk about it. 
 Okay, fine. 
 How long will you be staying? 
 Uh, just... a while probably. 
 I don't know... a few months. 
 Somebody torched my house. 
 They burned it down to the ground. 
 Now can I check in? 
 They torched your house? 
 - Yeah. 
  Your house? Sheriff Romero, the big daddy of White Pine Bay? I mean, what kind of crazy lunatic would torch your house? Yeah, good question. I mean, if I had torched your house, I'd be getting the hell out of town, 'cause I'd figure you'd be coming for my ass. What are you gonna do about it? Can I just check in? Room 11. Maid service is usually around noon. Any special requests? Privacy. Nick Ford's office. Yes, hello. I'd like to speak with Nick Ford, please. Who's calling? [Clears throat] Um, I'm Norma Bates. I own the Bates Motel. I met Mr. Ford at a party. He gave me his card, and we're supposed to discuss something. Please hold. [Muzak plays] Hello, Norma Bates. Hi. Hello. Yes. Thank you for taking my call. Well, I've actually been waiting for you to call. I've been thinking about what we talked about at the valet stand, and I have some ideas. You do? Ideas... great. Um, when can we get together? Can I meet you somewhere? Well, how about you come down to my boat? Boat? Okay. It's at the Deep Cove Yacht Club. Just go down to the main gate on the docks at 2:30 and dial 4-8-1-6. Dial 4-8-1-6. Okay, got it. I'll see you then. See you. [King Harvest's Dancing in the Moonlight] ♪ We get it on most every night ♪ 
♪ When that moon... ♪ Hey. I didn't know you were working today. Oh, I'm not. I'm just passing the time before tech. Oh. Yeah. [Grunts, chuckles] Got to meet Cody in a little while. How's Dylan? Dylan moved out. What? ♪ They don't bark, and they don't bite ♪ My mom and him... they've never really gotten along. You know, they had a big fight. Anyway, it doesn't really matter what it's about, right? It's just something that can't be fixed, and we have to accept it. What could possibly happen that couldn't be fixed? [Door opens] Hey, you. Hello. Anything we can do for you today? No, I'm good. So what do you like to do after work? Um, usually I... Usually I-I just go home. Yeah, that's, uh... that's not gonna work. Let me put it this way... What are we doing after work tonight? ♪ Dancing in the moonlight ♪ We could take a walk down by the beach. Okay, that sounds good. What time you done? Around 5:00. Okay, cool. Well, you can pick me up at my place just down there. It's that door right there. [Laughs] Yeah, I-I remember. All right. He sells pot, you know. Yeah, I know. Okay, okay. I'm not marrying him. He's here for the summer, and he's nice. He sells pot. Nobody's perfect. [Hard rock music] And look, it's Cody Brennen. [Lighter clicks] Hey. Norman, did you remember the handsaw? No. I'll... I'll be right back, okay? Hold on. I'll be back. Who is that? Cody. We're doing tech together. She's just giving me a ride, okay? I'm getting a saw. I'll be right back. I'll be right back! Hello. I'm Norman's mother. How about that? Excuse me? I said, "how about that?" That you're Norman's mom. That's awesome. I'm super excited. And you are? Cody. Do you have a last name? [Scoffs] Brennen. Well, can you turn down your radio? This is my motel. I'd like it to be a peaceful experience for my guests. You got it. [Breathing heavily] Better go. Got a lot to do. Later, Mrs. Bates. [Engine turning over] So... You met my mom. [Laughs] Yeah. She's a piece of work. Holy crap! [Laughs] I'm sorry. I keep forgetting you like your mom. It's cool. I'm pretty sure you're gonna get an earful about me, though. Damn it. What? I forgot the money the producer gave me for lumber at my house. Can't we just swing on by and get it? Sure. Yeah, I guess we'll have to. I'm gonna be out for a few hours, Emma. Can you handle the desk? Sure. Norma, can I ask you something? Sure. What? It might seem a little weird. And I wouldn't ask you except I have no one else to ask. What? What's it like the first time you have s*x? Um... Why? Well, there's someone that I met, and every time I'm with him, that's pretty much all I'm thinking about, so it seems in the realm of possibility that it could happen and, I mean, because of my medical situation, I've never done it. And I don't have a mother to ask or a close girlfriend, and I can't exactly ask my dad. I-I tried googling it, but what I read just scared me. I hope you don't mind that I asked you. I mean, you don't have to answer if you don't want to. It might be inappropriate. I don't... If you have feelings for him and he's a good person, then... The first time you have s*x should be lovely. It should? Mm-hmm. It should. Okay. [Laughs] You're old enough that I don't have to lecture you about birth control and STDs and... Oh, my God, no, you don't. [Chuckles] [Giggles] Thank you. I'll be back in a few hours. I'm gonna stop the bypass from happening. [Rock music] ♪ Gonna get ya ♪ 
♪ Can take it, anyone ♪ 
♪ It's always someone else... ♪ No, wait in the car. [Chuckles awkwardly] Where the hell have you been? [Muffled yelling] [Muffled scream] [Muffled yelling continues] Don't you walk out on me when I'm talking to you! Get back here now! [Crying softly] I told you to wait in the car. [Engine turning over] You okay? Yeah, fine. My dad's a dick. Whatever. I got the money. How much is that? $600. Should be enough. Actually, screw the lumber. Maybe we should take this dough and get out of here... put this whole stupid place in our rearview. I'm not sure how well that would work for me, but... Why? Because you're scared? No, because my mom would probably put out an amber alert before we even hit Eagle Creek. [Chuckles] [Inhales deeply] We can do tech later. I want to show you something. Don't worry. It's around here. Okay. [Sighs] [Seal barking] [Keys clacking] May I help you? Yes, hello. I'm here to see Nick Ford. [Gate buzzes] Over here, Norma Bates. I see you found the place. Is that your boat? Yes, it is. Come on aboard. Just come up around the back. Thank you so much for seeing me. Your boat... uh, "boat"... your yacht is beautiful. "Boat" is fine. [Laughs] Would you like something to drink? No. I'm okay. Thank you. Let's have a little something. Okay. Andrea, a bottle of the Chevalier-Montrachet in the fridge. Of course, Mr. Ford. Let's go inside. All right. So let's talk bypass, shall we? Okay. I'm still in awe of you, by the way... Going off on Lee Berman, that arrogant ass. Well, I'm sure you could tell him whatever you wanted, and he'd actually listen. [Chuckles] You would think so, yes. Yes, you would, but it doesn't work that way. Why doesn't it? It just doesn't. But you, Norma Bates, you have nothing to lose by going against him. You have no position, no power. You're an innocent... a young... Single mother, a businesswoman fighting to save her motel. It's... it's quite touching. Hmm. Yes. I can't oppose him openly. I'm too mixed up in everything that goes on in this town. But you can. I can? You can oppose him for both of us. Well, if you ask me, the problem is Lee Berman. Before he got on the city council, the bypass was totally stalled. Yeah, that's true. But don't worry about Lee Berman. I'm gonna help you maneuver this, and I'll pull some strings when I'm able to. How does that sound? That sounds great. Good. This could be fun. [Laughs] To doing what's right. [Chuckles] Mmm. You like it? Yes, it's... it's very good. [Laughs] It's very good. Okay. The first thing I want you to do... Mm-hmm. Go see this guy. Okay. This will be our first shot across their bow. So who... who... 
 
 Excuse me. Mr. Ford, it's time for the conference call. They're holding. I really have to take this call. Just go see him. I'll be in touch. Oh, okay. Sorry. But thank you so much for doing this. I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am. You're a charming woman, Norma. It's gonna be a real pleasure working with you. Hi. Sorry. I didn't realize this door opened right into your office. I'm looking for Brian Fuller. Oh, that's me. I'm Norma Bates. Nick Ford gave me your card? Oh, great. Yeah, I have your report right here. Okay. Yeah, just finished it. You just finished it? Finished what? The report. It's all set. You can file it as is. File it? Nick didn't explain all the details to you, did he? No. Okay, so I'm a biologist, and I prepared this. It's an environmental impact report with a request for an immediate injunction. "Pistol river pocket gopher"? Yeah, they're on the endangered-species list, and they just happen to live on the land where they want to build the bypass. I see. [Laughs] Oh, okay, so... So just file that down at City Hall, and it should bring everything to a grinding halt... For a while, anyways. Do I owe you anything for this? No, it's all taken care of. Okay, then. [Sighs] This is so great. [Laughs] This is great. Thank you very much. [Rock music] Hey, boys. What's going on? We're just packaging up the 50 keys that we're shipping down to Palo Alto. Cool. Hey, you want to grab some lunch later? Sure. Yeah, I thought we'd go to that Mexican place that Remo's always talking about... You know, talk shop. Yeah, yeah. What time do you want us to meet you there? "Us"? Yeah, me and Remo. Oh, no. No, Remo can't go. Those duffels of cash got to make it up to Checco's. He's making a delivery for me. You got a problem? No, no, I just kind of... just a bit psyched for some Mexican. Well, maybe Dylan will bring you some leftovers. You said you, uh, come out here at night? Mm-hmm. Isn't it kind of scary? [Scoffs] Well, I mean, you know, a girl out here by herself. What, I'm gonna have an altercation with a ground squirrel? No, you're just, uh, so alone out here. You don't avoid things just because you're scared of them. [Chuckles] [Bottle opens] You heard my dad yelling? Uh-huh. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm almost 18. I can leave soon. You're lucky you have such a good relationship with your mom. Hey. You remember when I said I could be a really nice guy, Zane? You remember that? Till I break you? Get up. That's the warm-up, Zane. When you least expect it, I'm gonna show up, and I'm gonna bury you and your little business in the ground. And now you know I'm a man of my word, right, Zane? [Breathing heavily] Just between you and me, I've been thinking of hitchhiking down the pacific coast of Mexico. Wouldn't that be cool? [Chuckles] I've never met a girl like you. Like what? Uh, you're just so, um... [Chuckles] I don't know. I guess I feel safe with you. That's a weird thing for a guy to say, isn't it? No, it's nice, actually. Can I tell you something... Something I've never told anyone? Sure. When you found me in the coffee shop, that... that wasn't the first time. The blackout? How many times has that happened? I don't know... mm, a couple? You know, it's like I get upset or stressed or something, and then I don't remember. At least you can get lost in your own head. I've got to come all the way out here to do it. Come on, I want to show you something. Yo, wait up! Cody? Right here, dude! Aah! [Laughs] You're just plain mean. You didn't know that? Check it out. Now we go up. Just follow me. [Grunts] You can use that board as a step. Aah! You're all right. You're fine. Just hang on. Pull yourself up. Grab up higher on the rope. [Grunting] [Laughs] Oh, boy, that was, uh... [Both laugh] The rope is sketchy, but... Then again, I don't want anybody else ever coming up here. [Chuckles] Excuse me. I'm Norma Bates of the Bates Motel. I'd like to deliver this to all the members of the city council... Especially Mr. Lee Berman. Tell him Norma Bates said hello. It was really hard to find this address. I'm glad you did. Wow. You look beautiful. I was checking out the real-estate last time I was up here. You're moving here? I'd like to... Someday. I need a ton of money first, though. Well, if you want to make money, you're in the right business. Yeah. It'll take a while, though. I'd like to get my own little piece of property up in the hills, you know, grow my own crop. You mean weed, right? We're talking weed, not corn. Yes, weed. [Chuckles] So you want your own little weed farm to call your own? Something like that. That's nice. You can have that dream... your own little weed farm. This is America. Are you gonna kiss me now? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. What the hell happened to you? I had to kick the sh1t out of somebody. W-where are my clothes? Your clothes? You mean the ones you left in a heap all over your room? Yeah, yeah, those clothes. They're upstairs. I washed them. You're sticking your hand in an ice bucket? Have you cleaned that cut? Okay, I don't remember asking you to take care of my laundry. Sorry. Next time I'll leave them on the floor. Well, isn't that what happens at most motels? The motel owner doesn't come into your room and pick up your clothes and do your laundry for you. I know you. How does that matter? Of course it matters. Come upstairs. It's gonna get infected. No, I'm not... it's fine. It's not fine. It's dirty, and you need to clean it up. So why exactly did you need to beat up someone? Let's just say I had my reasons. Don't you ever get tired of being so stoic? Seriously, you never want to talk about anything. It's a little boring. So is being dead. You learn not to shoot your mouth off in this business. Okay, tough guy, whatever. I get it. Sometimes it just feels good to whale on someone. I whacked the sh1t out of the real-estate agent who sold me this house when I found out that I-I couldn't unload it. I did it with my purse. It felt great. Oh, my God. What? You smiled. I thought your face was paralyzed. Uh-huh. I'm pretty sure I didn't smile. God, you're contrary. Oh, and you're not? Well, I'm working on it. You know, I'm making friends, trying to be more social. I met this guy recently. I wonder if you know who he is... Nick Ford. Where'd you meet him? At a party at Christine and Peter Helden's house. Why? What's wrong? Nick Ford's in the drug business. You're not involved with him somehow, are you? No. No, I'm not involved in anything at all. I'm just wondering if you know who he is. You want my advice? Stay away from him at all costs. Okay. There's your laundry. Yeah, don't ever do it again. You're welcome. [Man speaking Spanish on radio] Hello there. It's Norman, and I will call you back. [Beep] [Door opens] [Grunts] What the hell happened to you? Romero. He did that to you? Hey... I hired a guy to torch the dude's house. So what do you expect? But it was worth every minute of it. [Glass clinks] I see you started without me. Hey! Can I get a damn beer? So we roll back to his place, right? Me, him, and three German girls. I mean, he's got this insane house overlooking all of Hollywood with a vodka tasting room. You know what that is? No. Hmm. It's an all-glass freezer room that he keeps at 28 degrees, and it's just stocked with bottles of every... [Tires squealing] Premium vodka around the world. And we go inside... [gunshots] [Engine roars] [Tires squealing] [Tires squealing] [Engine roars] Norman. Norman, I need to talk to you. I don't know where you've been, and I'm not gonna give you the third degree. I'm not gonna be that mother. I raised you to make good choices, and I'm gonna assume that you will, but I will tell you one thing. Okay. That girl is not a good choice. She's rude. She's disrespectful to adults. I mean, not to be prejudiced, but she smokes and has tattoos, which I could live with if she was decent, but she's not. She's really not like that, mother. She's a nice girl. I think she just gets uncomfortable around parents. Norman, women can be tricky. And you have such a good heart. There's girls like her, girls that have no future. They're just raised like a weed. They're just trapped in some unbearable circumstance that they can't get out of. I'm... I'm just saying, that's the kind of girl that can get you into trouble, hmm? You know, talk you into things, get pregnant. Next thing you know, your life is over. I-I didn't make the world the way it is. There are people who can help you and people who can hurt you, and you gotta pick the right people. That girl Cody is not the right people. I really don't want you seeing her anymore, Norman. I have to see her at tech. The play's in a few weeks. Then we'll be done. Okay, fine. Finish the play. You made a commitment. But I don't want you spending time with her outside of there, okay? Okay, mother. Okay. ♪ You're everything that I see ♪ 
♪ I want your hot love ♪ 
♪ And emotion endlessly ♪ 
♪ I can't get over you ♪ 
♪ You left your mark on me ♪ Is that gonna be okay? We're not going underwater, are we? [Both chuckle] Not that I can think of. ♪ 'Cause you're a good girl, and you know it ♪ 
♪ You act so different around me ♪ 
♪ 'Cause you're a good girl, and you know it ♪ 
♪ I know exactly who you could be ♪ 
♪ Just hold on, we're going home ♪ Second thought... maybe keep it close. - [Laughs] ♪ Just hold on... ♪ [Groans] [Sighs] What's the matter? You didn't hear the news? No, what news? Lee Berman, from the city council, was in a car accident tonight. His car crashed off Summit Vista road and then went all the way down into the Ravine. He's dead. You're awake. I heard you just saved my brother's life. We're gonna take care of all this... Expenses... Get you back on your feet. I don't want you worrying about any of it, okay? I just wanted to meet the famous Dylan Massett. Who are you? I'm your boss.
