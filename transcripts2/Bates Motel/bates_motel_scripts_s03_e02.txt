 Previously on Bates Motel... 
 Get out of the car. 
 It's me. 
 Dylan : How do you expect me to have a relationship with you under the circumstances? 
 Norma never has to know I'm here. 
 You're my son. 
 Are you okay? 
 My lung capacity has diminished, like, a lot. 
 I don't think you need to go to school. 
 You'd be okay with that? 
 I don't think school's been good for you. 
 Ah! 
 Emma : What's your name? 
 Annika Johnson. 
 I'm looking for a room for a couple of nights. 
 Do you have anything available? 
 Norman : So why are you visiting us? 
 Annika : Um, I work at parties. 
 You seem like a nice girl. 
 I am. 
 Why do you do this kind of work? 
 Once you start touching somebody's body, the rest of it just kind of melts away. 
 It's just s*x. 
 s*x is s*x. We all need it. 
 Turn down that road up ahead. 
 [knock on door] 
 Hello? It's Norma Bates. 
 I have some fresh towels here for you, and I want to check your bathroom window shade to make sure it's working. 
 Hello? 
 This is covering both nights. 
 I thought the Wi-Fi was free. 
 It is. 
 Well, why is it listed on the bill? 
 To show that you received it, but you see there's no charge. 
 Have you seen the girl in number four today? 
 She isn't in her room. 
 I saw her car here. 
 Maybe she got up early and went hiking. 
 She doesn't strike me as a hiker. 
 Ahem. 
 Just sign there if it's all okay. 
 Norma : Norman? 
 I'm here, mother. 
 What is that? 
 She's a baby goat. 
 I got her from the artisan cheese farm in the village. 
 Oh... 
 She's gonna be so beautiful when I'm done. 
 She was in their trash. 
 I cleaned her and froze her. 
 Please don't tell me you put that in our freezer. 
 Well, they have to be frozen to remove the skin properly. 
 Well, then I need a large freezer for down here. 
 Fine. 
 Did you see the girl in room four today? 
 No. 
 Why? 
 Um, it's just, um, her bed hasn't been slept in. 
 I went down there to make sure that her window shade was working, and clearly she hasn't slept in her bed. 
 Her car's still there, so I... Just seems odd. 
 Did you see her at all last night? 
 No. No, I didn't. 
 Okay. 
 Well, um... 
 Finish up with your goat, and, come on, get back down to your job. 
 And you have to stay on top of your school work. 
 Don't... Don't make me feel sorry that I let you home school. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Okay, mother. 
 I wouldn't worry about it. 
 About what? 
 The girl in room four. I'm sure she's fine. 
 Yeah. 
 [crackling electricity] 
 Caleb : We're gonna have to trench this whole perimeter and lay down rebar. 
 Hey, morning. 
 Good morning. 
 Hey, boy, hey. 
 Whose dog is this? 
 Oh, that's mine. He's Rex. 
 He's a great guard dog. 
 Hey, I was thinking, maybe we could rig up a pump to the lake, you know, for irrigation, you know, given we don't get caught. 
 What do you think? You ever hook up anything like that? 
 Yeah, I've hooked up every kind of sh1t. imaginable. 
 [laughs] 
 Damn, I'm glad he's here. 
 Might actually get this thing going now. 
 All right, I'll go get the equipment. 
 I'll start measuring this sh1t out. 
 Come on, buddy. 
 [dog barks] 
 Hey, thanks for letting me stay. 
 Has that girl come back yet? 
 I actually haven't seen her all day. 
 Why do you have groceries? 
 Oh, I was on my way up to the house. 
 I... I've just been so worried about her. 
 I don't even know why. 
 When is the last time you saw her? 
 Last night. 
 She was going somewhere in town. 
 Norman drove with her to show her where it was. 
 Norman went with her last night? 
 Well, yeah, he was just riding along. 
 He had to go pick up a new thermostat in town. 
 Maybe I shouldn't have said anything. 
 I really don't think it was a big deal that he went with her. 
 I think he was just trying to help. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 I just remembered I got to put these groceries away. 
 I-I bought ice cream. It's gonna melt. 
 Norman? 
 Norman! 
 What? 
 Why did you lie to me? 
 Hm? 
 Why didn't you tell me that you drove with that woman into town last night? 
 She asked me to drive her car back. 
 I know you don't like me driving without a license. 
 Norman, do not screw with me. 
 I'm not. 
 You were the last person seen with her, and now she's gone. 
 All I did was drive with her to this bar. 
 Okay, did she tell you why she was going to the bar, who she was meeting? 
 I need details, Norman. 
 It couldn't... Just try to remember anything. 
 She just said she was meeting a friend. 
 Yeah, she said she was going to be drinking, and maybe she shouldn't drive home. 
 You know, that her friend could bring her home, and then I just offered to drive her car back for her. 
 That's all. 
 Did she seem okay? Was she upset? 
 Was she worried about anything? 
 She was a little anxious maybe. I don't know. 
 She was very dressed up. 
 Okay. 
 Come on. 
 We're gonna get in the car, and you're gonna show me everything that happened, right now. 
 You shouldn't have gotten in the car with her, Norman. 
 Why? 
 Because you can't keep getting into cars with questionable women. 
 Questionable? 
 Slutty. 
 Oversexed. Crazy. 
 You're being ridiculous. 
 I'm not! 
 I mean, look what happened with Blaire Watson. 
 I mean, you got in the car with her that night, and it caused you a world of trouble. 
 I don't know why, but unhinged women seem drawn to you. 
 She's not unhinged, okay? 
 She's a very nice girl. 
 Maybe just a little troubled, but I was only trying to be helpful, and I needed to be in town anyway to pick up that new thermostat. 
 Troubled how? 
 I-I think she was a call girl of some kind, you know? 
 She told me she came into town to work at a party... 
 A party with rich men. 
 She told you that? 
 I'm not a little boy, mother. 
 No, I'm not saying that you are, I just... 
 I mean, why would she... 
 Why would she tell you that? 
 Come on, I'll show you where the bar is. 
 I'm gonna go see if they can tell me anything. 
 I'll come with you. 
 No, you stay here. 
 Okay. 
 Why did you say "was"? 
 "Was" what? 
 You said, "She was a nice woman,  and troubled." 
 Stop it, mother. 
 So? 
 They don't know anything. 
 They don't remember if she was there. 
 Let's just go home. 
 I don't know how long I can keep doing this, Norman. 
 Doing what? 
 Nothing. 
 Never mind. 
 Let's just go home. 
 I'm headed out. 
 I'll see y'all tomorrow. We'll go over the plans and figure out what lumber we need to buy. 
 What's your hurry, man? Grab a beer. 
 I got to head home. 
 I got a bunch of stuff I got to take care of. 
 [dog squeals] 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [dog growling] 
 Easy, boy. 
 Come here! 
 Hey! Come here, boy. 
 [dogs barking] 
 Hey! 
 Hey, Rex, come on! 
 [gunshot] 
 sh1t! 
 I'm gonna turn in. 
 Good night. 
 I have something I need to tell you, mother. 
 What is it? 
 I-I know you worry about me a lot, and I don't want you to. 
 You know, I really feel like everything's under control. 
 The school work, the motel, and I'm really okay... and I'm going to be dating Emma. 
 You are? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 When did this happen? 
 Just felt like the right time. 
 I'm 18 now, time to start laying some foundation. 
 So you're... You're okay with it? 
 Yeah. 
 I am. 
 Okay, mother. 
 Nighty-night. 
 Night, honey. 
 Emma : I read once that ramen is the worst kind of date food. 
 Probably due to all the slurping. 
 I think it's really nice that you and your mom are so worried about her. 
 You know, we can do the date another night if this is all too much. 
 No. 
 Mother's the one who's really worried. 
 She was upset I drove the car back. 
 I shouldn't have said you drove into town with her. 
 I wasn't thinking. 
 It's not your fault, Emma. 
 I want you to know that I don't tell your mom everything. 
 Like, the stuff that goes on between us... 
 It stays between us. 
 I better go. 
 I got to do something before. 
 I'll see you for our date tonight, okay? 
 I'll be here. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You need something? 
 I live, um, over the hill... 
 South face. 
 You know, we're neighbors. 
 [spits] 
 Oh. 
 I-I didn't know that we had any neighbors over the hill on the South face. 
 Well, you do. 
 So what's up? 
 [whistling] 
 I'm looking for my pet dog. 
 [whistles] 
 You know, he's a mutt. 
 I let him out last night, but he never came back. 
 Have you seen him? 
 No. 
 No? 
 Haven't seen him. 
 Haven't seen him. 
 Hm. 
 Well, you be sure to let me know if you do. 
 Yeah, if we see your dog, we'll stop everything and let you know. 
 I'm Caleb. This is my son, Dylan. 
 And you are? 
 Chick. 
 I'm Chick Hogan. 
 I live on the other side of the hill. 
 Yeah, well, thanks for stopping by, Chick. 
 Are you planting tomatoes? 
 Yeah. 
 And corn. 
 And green beans. 
 I like green beans. 
 I like green beans too. 
 Well, you know that last year the tomato crop was wiped out, yeah? 
 You knew that? 
 By the DEA. 
 So lots of opportunity. 
 [whistles] 
 She's still not here. 
 Should we call someone? Tell the sheriff about it? 
 No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to seem crazy. 
 She's... I mean, she's... she's just... probably with friends or something. 
 Let's just give it another day. 
 Have you thought about looking in her room? 
 For what? 
 Maybe something in there would give us an idea of where she's gone. 
 It's so funny how people leave their things. 
 There's such an energy in it, like the person's still present somehow in the animation. 
 Emma, please. 
 Sorry. 
 Oh. 
 What line of work is this woman in? 
 I think it's obvious. 
 What's the Arcanum Club? 
 It's a hunting club, I think. 
 Very exclusive. 
 High buy-in, old school. 
 My dad does some taxidermy for them. 
 It's around here? 
 I'm not sure. 
 My dad never talked about it. 
 I always got a feeling he didn't like something about it, but needed the job. 
 Why? 
 This is an invitation for tonight. 
 Emma, please don't say anything about this to Norman. 
 Okay. 
 Alex : Norma. 
 You're leaving? 
 Yeah, that new house is finally ready. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, uh, it's amazing how much stuff you can accumulate in a motel room over three months. 
 Oh, here. 
 And this is for all the time I spent here. 
 No, no. No, no. 
 No, no, no. 
 No. No, no, no, no. 
 Norma, you're gonna take the money. 
 No. No, you're a family friend. 
 I am not taking your money. 
 The bypass is half-paved, and they're starting cars on the finished part tomorrow. 
 You're gonna need it. I'm not taking no for an answer. 
 Thank you. 
 All right. Well, good-bye. 
 Thank you for everything. 
 Sure. Sure, sure, sure. 
 Yeah. 
 So, um... 
 I don't know, I guess I'll see you around. 
 Yeah. 
 Well. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Um, I just wanted to tell you... 
 I always felt safe when you were here. 
 Thank you, Norma. 
 I was just wondering when it was you realized you wanted to go out with me, and what was the moment that put it all in focus for you? 
 Everything's changing right now, you know? 
 A lot of things don't make sense, but we kind of do. 
 Okay. Cheers. 
 I just feel like I'm gonna see this whole other side to you. 
 What do you mean? 
 Like, how friends do different things than people who are dating. 
 Did you, uh... 
 Did you and Gunner ever have s*x? 
 Yeah. Is that... Is that weird for you? 
 Did you feel bad after? 
 I guess I felt kind of naughty, but I think you're supposed to. 
 That's part of the fun. 
 Why, do you feel bad after s*x? 
 Norman? 
 No. 
 Maybe just depends on the person. 
 You know, sometimes it's, um... 
 It just feels overwhelming like it's this other part of me. 
 Yeah, s*x is complicated, you know? 
 It's supposed to be. It's not cracking an egg. 
 It's something of importance. 
 It's the basis of procreation, you know? 
 It's kind of magical and heady. 
 It's not nothing. 
 No, no. 
 It's definitely big, I just... 
 You know, I'm not sure I'd refer to it using the term "magical." 
 I love your mom, but I think she loves you so much that she can't stand the thought of you growing up. 
 So maybe this gives you a feeling that being an adult, being sexual, is somehow wrong. 
 Well, she does the best she can. 
 We're just close. 
 Yeah, and you always will be, but that doesn't mean you can't grow up. 
 Unless you're Peter Pan. 
 Do you want to be Peter Pan? 
 Maybe. 
 If you'll be Wendy. 
 Peter and Wendy never got to have s*x. 
 Oh. 
 [muttering] 
 How can I help you? 
 I'm on the list for the party. 
 Your name? 
 Annika Johnson. 
 I need the password. 
 Uh... 
 The password. 
 I don't think I know the password. 
 You'll need to leave then. 
 Dylan : Why do we have to do this? 
 Caleb : The guy came and pissed on our grass. 
 We're gonna piss on his. 
 It's important. It sets a tone. 
 What if he was just looking for his dog? 
 That ass-clown doesn't have a dog. 
 He probably just saw the dead one and used that to throw you off balance. 
 Now it's time to change things up. 
 Let's go. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Look, we just came over because I think we accidentally shot your dog. 
 He got into a fight with our dog, and we didn't know. 
 I don't have a dog. 
 Look, you gonna invite us in? 
 (woman) Todo Bien? 
 Take Sinoh and go inside. 
 Hm? 
 Man, you got a lot of guns. 
 Define "a lot." 
 Well, it means more than a few. 
 That's right. 
 I have more than a few guns. 
 Speaking of guns, you shouldn't be shooting off guns around here. 
 It attracts too much attention. 
 He didn't fire a gun. I did. 
 Yeah, you did. 
 You know, it just... It steps on the peaceful environment that we have here. 
 It rattles Mother Nature. 
 You understand that, don't you, Dylan? 
 Yeah, sure. We do. 
 You know, there's rules, right? 
 We respect the rules. 
 That's how we respect each other, right? 
 If we all understand the rules, then we can coexist. 
 Isn't that right, Dylan? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I guess. 
 Good. 
 How many plants do you guys got? 
 Honestly, Chick, that's none of your God damn business. 
 We're cultivating 99 plants. 
 It's the medical marijuana limit. 
 You guys remind me of these two guys in a book. 
 You don't have any rabbits up there, do you? 
 To rabbits. 
 Let's go. 
 Oh, yeah, one more thing... 
 We are gonna do whatever the hell we want on our own God damn property. 
 That includes shooting guns. 
 All right? 
 When we all see each other, we're gonna be neighborly. 
 We're gonna nod or wave, but we are not gonna be showing up on each other's porches borrowing a cup of sugar. 
 Okay, there are boundaries, and we are gonna stay in them. 
 Let's go. 
 Norma? 
 Norma. 
 Oh, my... Oh, my God! 
 You need to get out of here right now. 
 Oh, my... What are you doing here? 
 What am I doing here? 
 I was pressing the flesh with some council members, and I see a figure sneaking along in the shadows, and I followed it, and here you are. 
 I don't know why, but you need to get out of here. 
 No. Do you... look what is going on inside there. 
 Do you know what kind of people these are? 
 Yeah, incredibly wealthy people doing whatever the hell they feel like. 
 What does any of this have to do with you, Norma? 
 There's a young woman, she's a guest in my motel. 
 She's been missing for two nights. 
 She hasn't been back. She hasn't slept in the bed. 
 But all her belongings are still there. 
 I... I don't get it. 
 Well, she had an invitation to this party. 
 She's a... I think she's, uh... working. 
 I'm really worried about her. 
 Could you please just go in and see if you can see her there? 
 She's about 5'8", blonde. 
 She's a really, lovely, lovely girl. 
 I'm just afraid that she might be dead. 
 When did you see her last? 
 Norman was the last person who saw her. 
 He drove into town with her, and um... 
 I haven't seen her since. 
 Okay, you need to go now. 
 This is not a good place for you to be. 
 Then... Then why are you here? 
 I'm not here for that. 
 Okay, there's a gate all the way in back. 
 Sneak right under it and get out right now before anyone sees you. 
 Okay. Okay, okay, but... 
 Just go. 
 It's dangerous for you. Get out. 
 All right, but her name is Annika Johnson. 
 If you could just go and... 
 Go! 
 Okay, okay. 
 [sighs] 
 [grunts] 
 Ow! 
 [screams] 
 I hate you! 
 I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! 
 You stupid piece of sh1t sign! 
 I hate you! 
 [panting] 
 Thank you for dinner. 
 It was fun. 
 [laughs] 
 Well, I better get going. 
 I've got to open up early tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 What? 
 I, uh... I just don't want to start something we can't finish, you know, in front of... 
 In front of my house, and all. 
 Yeah, fair enough. 
 See you tomorrow then. 
 Yeah, you will. 
 What happened? 
 I knocked over the Lee Berman Memorial Bypass sign with my car. 
 On purpose? 
 Of course on purpose. 
 What do you think, I bump into signs by accident? 
 What's going on, huh? 
 Why are you all dressed up? 
 Why are you dirty? 
 Because I went to a party, and then... and then I decided to leave. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 What party? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 [cries] 
 You've been through a lot, mother. 
 No, it was just a bad party. 
 No, I mean, in the last two years. 
 I'm a little worried about you. 
 You're worried about me? 
 You just... 
 You seem a little different lately. 
 Stop worrying. 
 It's all gonna be good, Mother. 
 You'll see.
