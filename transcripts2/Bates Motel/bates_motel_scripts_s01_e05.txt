 Previously on  Bates Motel... 
 You're new. What's your name? 
 Norman Bates. 
 Bradley Martin. 
 You have any questions at school, you call me. 
 So, the other night, why'd you leave the party so early? 
 [Engine revving] 
 That's my dad's car. 
 [Tires screech] 
 Dad! 
 [Gasps, cries] 
 Oh, my-- it's like somebody's with you your whole life, and then they're just gone. 
 Do you want to go to my room? 
 I just want to be happy. 
 I like being with you, Norman. 
 I love you, Norman. 
 You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
 I love you too, mom. 
 Norman? 
 I kept Keith's belt. 
 Why would you do that, Norman? 
 I was sexually assaulted, and I killed a man. 
 Why would you ever, ever in a million years-- why would you want to keep a memento of that? 
 Romero never saw the belt. 
 I found it. I took it. 
 So no one else knows. 
 So don't you worry, okay? 
 Everything is gonna be fine. 
 Norma Louise Bates, you're under arrest for the murder of Keith Summers. 
 [Hawk screeches] 
 [Chuckles] 
Uh, hey. 
 [Soft laugh] 
Hey. 
 Uh, mom asleep? 
 She's in jail. 
 How are you? 
 I've been better. 
 What can we do? How do we help? 
 I'm glad you want to help, Norman. 
 Really, it's big of you. 
[Chuckles] 
 Any mother would be broken in half by such devotion. 
 Your bail is set at $100,000. 
 You got that laying around? 
 No? 
 No, I didn't think so. 
 Look, we can use the motel as collateral. 
 You know what? Just--just leave me here. 
 And get the hell out of here, both of you, seriously. 
 I don't need your help. This is all a big mistake. 
 It's just gonna clear itself up. 
[Sniffles] 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Given everything that happened, you don't need any help? 
 Yeah. 
 Now get out of here. 
 You got no one else to help. 
 Get out of here! 
 Mom, I want to help you. 
 Please. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Ding] 
 Oh, Emma. Uh... you're better. 
 What? 
 I heard about your mom. That she was arrested and charged with the murder of Keith Summers. 
 How did you hear already? 
 Big news in a small town, Norman. 
 Anyway, I'm--I am sorry. I mean, um... 
 I'm just sorry because... 
 Damn, that's gotta suck. 
 Yep, it sucks. 
 You're welcome to come stay with us. 
 Well, thank you, um, but I've got my brother, you know, Dylan, and we should, um-- 
 Your brother, right, yeah. 
 I-I forgot about that. 
 Found it. 
 Found what? 
 The deed to the motel. 
 I can, uh, I can go get bail money for my mom now. 
 You want me to take you? 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Hey, so these-- these guys we work for... 
 Think they'd give me a-- an advance? 
 How much? 
 I don't know. Maybe $5,000? 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, buddy. 
 Never mind. 
 They just don't exactly have a credit union, you know? 
 And they barely know you. Besides... 
 I've seen what they do to people who owe them money. 
 Yeah, it's just... 
 I don't know, I-I think maybe I need to get my own place. 
 You know, someplace good for me and my brother to live. 
 For--forget it, I-- 
 I'll figure it out, man. It's cool. 
 [Door unlocking] 
 I'm not hungry. 
 You should really eat something. 
 I don't care about food right now. 
 Thank you for taking me, Emma. 
 You're a good friend. 
 Well, if you can't count on your friends to help bail your mother out of prison, then really... what good are they? 
 So, Jonn's not here. 
 I'll wait with you. 
 So, you... so you know the girl from the manga book, right? 
 Of course. 
 I found her. 
 What? 
 Yeah, now... this is gonna sound so weird, and I can't explain it all to you. 
 You're just gonna have to accept that, okay? 
 You can't start asking a whole bunch of questions. 
 Okay. 
 She was being held prisoner in this guy's basement. 
 Oh, my God. What guy? 
 He's a cop. 
 He's a cop? 
 Yeah, a cop. 
 Oh, my God. 
 The cops are in on it. 
 Don't start freaking out, Emma. 
 I'm not freaking out. This is a police conspiracy. 
 No, we don't know that it's a police conspiracy. 
 For all I know, it's just this one cop, deputy shelby. 
 We have to go to the authorities. 
 We're not going to the authorities. 
 My mom's in jail. 
 But Norman, we have to! 
 I can't bring more crap down on her. 
 How did you find her? 
 I can't answer that. 
 Of course you can. 
 Emma, I told you I couldn't. 
 All right. 
 We have to go get her. 
 She's gone. 
 How do you know? 
 Just stop asking questions! 
 You can't expect me to not ask questions, especially if you're not explaining the situation. 
 I should never have said anything. 
 You're freaking out. 
 I'm not freaking out. 
 You're freaking out all over Italy. 
 I'm sorry, Emma. 
 I just knew it was so important to you. 
 I want to do something about it, I just can't until I deal with my mom. 
 Please, Emma. 
 We will help the girl. 
 I just have to make sure my mom is safe. 
 Okay, Norman. I get it. 
 Hi. How are you? 
 You want me to go in with you? 
 No, I'd rather just, uh... but thanks for bringing me. 
 No problem. 
 Oh, and Norman? 
 Did she do it? 
 I wouldn't blame her. Keith Summers was a pig. 
 No, she didn't. 
 [Phone chirps] 
 [Distant thunder rumbles] 
 [Door opens] 
 I brought you flowers. 
 That's nice. 
 Got cab money. 
 You use it. I'm walking. 
 Mom, come on. 
 Don't you "Mom, come on" me. 
 I have nothing to say to you. 
 [Gulls squawking] 
 [Fog horn sounds] 
 Mother, when are you gonna look at me? 
 [Footsteps approach] 
 Mrs. Bates? 
 If you follow me, Ms. Craig will see you now. 
 Thank you. 
 So, Keith Summers. Everyone knew he was unhappy you bought the motel. 
 I suppose. 
 So it's not unreasonable to assume he was intent on harassing you. 
 Which would explain why his truck was parked near your property. 
 If you don't mind me asking, um... how old are you exactly? 
 I'm 33. 
 So, Keith Summers was probably trying to sabotage your efforts to reopen the motel, trying to inhibit your ability to turn his failure into a successful business. 
 Excuse me, what are you doing? 
 It's like this--thing right now, this thing that you're doing. 
 It sounds like you're trying to make up a story. 
 You are charged with murder. 
 I'm talking to you about your defense. 
 I don't need a defense. I didn't do it. 
 Norma... 
 Mm? 
 The prosecution is going to have a carpet fiber that matches the carpeting you were pulling up in your motel the night Keith Summers disappeared. 
 That same fiber was found under the band of Keith Summer's watch. 
 I mean, why does everyone find it so incriminating that there was carpet fiber under his watch? 
 The man owned the motel for 40 years. 
 Mom-- 
 I mean, why isn't anybody thinking about that? 
 Mom, just--mom-- 
 Stay out of this, Norman. You know, it's like everybody all of a sudden has just got together and decided that I am guilty. 
 It's hard to refute DNA evidence. 
 I don't care. According to whom? 
 Who's running these tests? I want to run my own tests. 
 Norma-- 
 Rebecca, I didn't do it. 
 Okay, I'm not going to walk into a court of law and say that I did it in self-defense just to make your job easier. 
 I didn't do it! 
 I'm done here. 
 I guess we're-- 
I guess we're leaving. 
 You're being unreasonable, mom. You're lying. 
 Don't start, Norman. 
 I have to say it. 
 You're not doing anything to help yourself. 
 They have evidence against you. 
 What difference does it make to you, anyway? 
 What are you talking about? 
 What difference does it make to me? 
 You do not care about me. 
 You went out and you got laid that night that I was crying in my room worried sick about all of this, about what could happen, about me being taken away from you and put in jail. 
 You went out, and you got laid! 
 Mom, I'm ju--I'm--I'm-- 
I'm sorry. 
 It just happened, you know? 
 She texted me, and Dylan said I should go. 
 Oh, there's a surprise. 
 Who was it? 
 Mother... 
 Fine, don't tell me. I don't want to know anyway. 
 This is all Dylan's fault. 
 Don't blame him, mom. He's just worried about me! 
 He's just trying to turn you against me! 
 No one could do that! 
 Really? 
 You told him our personal business. 
 You told him what happened. 
 How could you do that to me, Norman? 
 'Cause you do things that don't make sense, mom. 
 You scare me. I'm scared, okay? 
 I think you might need help. 
 I scare  you? 
 [Sighs] 
 There's something every mother dreams their children will tell them one day. 
 All I have ever done was try to give you a decent life. 
 Get out of my car! 
 I didn't mean it that way. Just listen-- 
 I don't care! Get out of my car! 
 It's like ten miles to our house. 
 If I'm so damn scary, get the hell out of my car! 
 Mom, no, it's--it's-- Mom, come on. Mom, what are you doing? 
 
 
 
 [Engine cuts off] 
 What are you doing out here? 
 Mom kicked me out of the car. 
 Way out here? 
 Welcome to the doghouse. 
 Hop on. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Ready? 
 Why'd you get out of the car? 
 She said, "Get out." 
 Yeah, well, that's her thing. 
 She makes a big fuss, so then you will be like, "Oh, don't worry, mother. It'll all be fine." 
 She's going through a lot. 
 Yeah, she's always going through a lot. 
 It's not gonna change. 
 She lives for the drama. 
 She's like an addict, Norman. And when you have an addict in your life, the best thing you can do for them, and for yourself, is walk away. 
 That might have worked for you, Dylan, but not for me. 
 You don't just walk away from your parents. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Of course you do. 
 We all do. I mean, isn't that the point? 
 You--you leave the nest. 
 I'm getting my own place. 
 Where? 
 Down by the beach. 
 It's an ocean view. 
 And if she goes to jail, you're moving in with me. 
 And if she doesn't-- well, I still think that you should move in with me. 
 You gotta cut the cord sometime, right? 
 She can't get through this. Not without me. 
 She's my mom, Dylan. 
 Yeah, well... given who she is, that's not really much of a reason to stay. 
 Hey, how much do you think places around here go for? 
 It depends. 
 I found a cool place for like 22 hunny a month. 
 Oh, I got some food at that bagel store by Bayview. 
 I thought you might be hungry. 
 Oh. 
 [Chuckles] 
Um... what did you do, rob the bagel place? 
 No, I just threw it in there. It's for you. 
 So you can get that place for you and your bro. 
 I-I thought the bosses didn't give advances. 
 Oh, they don't. 
 It's my money, but I know you're good for it. 
 How much is this? 
 5 grand. 
 It's fine, you'll pay me back. 
 Look, you're gonna do well in this business. 
 You'll make me look good for bringing you in. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Oh, this guy. Put that down. 
 Hey, Ethan. 
 You finally get your sh1t in order? 
 You know, he's been bugging me to come down and break your leg or something. 
 Yeah. Yeah, man. I-I got my sh1t in order. 
 Good. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Hey! 
 Hey, man, here. 
[Chokes, gurgles] 
 Here, hold--hold this on! 
 Hold this on, hold this on! 
 [Chokes, coughs] 
 [Coughs] 
 All right, hold on! 
 Keep some pressure on it, okay? 
[Engine starts] 
 [Engine revs, tires screech] 
 Come on, man, stay with me, stay with me! 
 I'm gonna get you to the hospital, okay? 
 Just hold on, hold on! 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Tires screech] 
 Come on. 
 Hang on, come on! 
 [Grunting] 
 Hang on! Help! 
 Somebody please, help! 
 I need help! He got shot! 
 Help, stat! 
 Please, help him! Help him. 
 Okay, what happened? 
 He got shot in the neck! 
 Okay. What's his name? 
 Ethan! 
 Ethan what? 
 What's his last name? Last name, last name? 
 I don't know his last name! 
 Okay, room two now. 
 Stay here, okay? Room two, guys. 
 Come on, go, go, go, go, go! 
 Yeah, I got it started. 
 I know they got a line in. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 [Car engine puttering] 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Sighs] 
 So here I am. 
 What is it? 
 Norma, I am sorry. 
 I'm so sorry that I had to be the one to come in and bring you to the station. 
 All in a day's work. 
 We have to not see each other for a while. 
 It's not safe if we get seen together. 
 That--that'll ruin your whole-- 
 Okay, just stop. 
 Stop. 
 Norma? Norma! 
 What are you doing? Norma? 
 I'm leaving. 
 That's what this is all about, isn't it? 
 I've become too much of a... 
 Come on! 
 ...liability for you to screw anymore! 
 Hey, for God's sakes, would you just shut up! 
 I love you, you idiot. 
 I can't tell you what I've gone through since you got arrested, knowing that you were in there, alone...terrified. 
 And I could do nothing about that. 
 That was hell, Norma. 
 Absolute hell. 
 [Moans] 
[Sniffles] 
 I'm gonna think of something. I don't know what. 
 Just don't do anything stupid, get yourself caught, or worse. 
 I'll figure it out. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Evening, Regina. 
 Evening. 
 Hey, is--is Romero here yet? 
 Uh, he's checking on a burglary. 
 Some vacation house up on Ridgecrest. 
 Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard that. 
 Eh, we're out of I.R. forms. 
 Where do we keep those? 
 In the back. 
 In the back, like the closet, or the cabinet? 
 I'll just go get them for you. 
 Appreciate that. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Here's your forms. 
 Great, thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Tires screech, engine roars] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Engine roars] 
 [Thud] 
Aah! 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Crowd chattering] 
 [Gulls squawking] 
 [Phone rings] 
 Bates Motel. 
 Mrs. Bates. 
 It's Rebecca Craig. 
 Hello, Rebecca. 
 It's over. 
 What's over? 
 Your case. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I filed a discovery motion for the carpet sample so we could run our own test, and they've denied the request. 
 Well, they can't do that, can they? 
 No. No, no. That's not what happened. 
 They can't deny it. It's our right. 
 What I'm hearing through the grapevine is that they've lost the fiber sample. 
 Without that evidence, they have no case. 
 [Line ringing] 
 Hey, it's Bradley. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Leave your name and number. 
 Oh, it's--yeah. 
 [Beep] 
Um--I, uh... 
 Well, I was just, you know, wondering how you were. 
 Um, I mean with all the, you know, all the stuff you're going through, and I-I just haven't heard-- not that I--not that I should. 
 I mean, if you wanted to call me that's totally fine but it's not, you know, like I'm expecting it or anything. 
 Um, so, uh, yeah. I, um... 
 I've had a-a really good time seeing you lately. 
 It's been--it's been fun, nice spending time with you. 
 Um, I know you're really busy and stuff and, uh... you know, me too. I-I get that. 
 It's--you've got a lot of stuff going on in your life. 
 I'm not an idiot. 
[Laughs] 
 But, uh, but yeah. 
 Um, call me, uh, you know, if you-- 
 I-I hope you're okay. 
 Bye. 
 [Door opens] 
 They lost the evidence. 
 They--they have no case against me. 
 They're gonna throw the whole thing out. 
 How could evidence just disappear? 
 I-- 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes! Yes, I'm sure! I'm sure, yes! 
 I'm sure. 
 It's like a miracle. 
 Well, I don't think it's a miracle. 
 I'm pretty sure it was Zack. 
 So "Mr. Wonderful" saves the day again. 
 What's he gonna make you do for this one? 
 What do you expect me to think, mom? 
 [Door opens, slams] 
 [Car approaches] 
 Norman! Norman, get in the car! 
 Come on, hurry up! 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 I have to tell you something. 
 Take me somewhere. I want to get out of here. 
 No, but I have to tell you. 
 I have an idea where the girl might be. 
 Just get me out of here. 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Gulls squawking] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 Well, here we are. I took you somewhere. 
 You okay? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm okay. 
 Do you want to talk about it? 
 Nope. 
 Oh. 
 II thought you wanted to tell me something about the girl. 
 It just seems rude to just launch into-- 
 Emma. The girl. 
 Okay. [Laughs] 
 So, I was trying to figure out where this cop might have hid the girl if she isn't in his basement anymore. 
 So I'm going like, "If I had an Asian s*x slave, where would I hide her?" 
 So I'm thinking, does this guy own a cabin somewhere? 
 A lake house? Any other family property? 
 But I googled that and came up with nothing. 
 So then I start wondering, if this cop had one of these girls, then he probably knew about the business that was being run out of the motel. 
 The one described in the journal, you know? 
 So then I start thinking, maybe this cop was in the business with Keith Summers and now Keith Summers is dead. 
 Are you okay? 
 Then why do you keep checking your phone? 
 Is something wrong? 
 Emma, I've got to tell you this. 
 I'm--I'm kind of with Bradley now. 
 How do you mean, "with"? 
 Well, like with. 
 Like--like, we're together. 
 We like each other. 
 What's this based on? 
 I slept with her. 
 Two nights ago. 
 It doesn't really mean anything, you know? 
 Well, it means something. 
 It means you hooked up. 
 You can make it sound like that, but-- 
 Because that's what it was. It--it was a hookup. 
 Yeah, well, or maybe it was more. 
 Did she change her relationship status? 
 Hookup. 
 So you were googling something? 
 Keith Summers and property or something? 
 If you were in an illegal business with someone and that person died, might you not use their property to hide something or someone? 
 Keith Summers owned a boat. 
 This is freaking insane, Emma. 
 Hey, the worst thing that will happen is we'll fail. 
 Or we'll get arrested for breaking and entering. 
 Slip 815. There it is. 
 The Seafarer. 
 Thanks. 
 [Grunts] 
 That'll work. 
 What now? 
 I don't know. 
 Look around. 
 [Screams] 
 Aah! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God, she's here. She's actually here. 
 Get me out! Get me out! 
 Hey. Hey! 
 [Pants wildly] 
 I kill you! Get me out! 
 [Muffled screams] 
It's okay. 
 What happens in your plan now? 
 Let's just get her out of here. 
 [Both struggling, grunting] 
 God, she's passed out again. Can you help me? 
 [Grunting] 
 [Grunts] 
[Moans] 
 Come on. Up here. 
 [Indistinct muttering] 
 Well, we should clean her up a little. 
 She's got vomit in her hair. 
 I'll go get a wet towel. 
 Oh, great. 
 Norman? 
[Water running] 
 [Water turns off] 
Norman, what is going on? 
 Why is this girl here? 
 Mom, maybe you should just sit down for a sec. 
 Does she know? 
 Do I know what? 
 Mom, please, just sit down. 
 No, I don't want to sit down. 
 I want to know what the three of you are doing in our motel room, 'cause right now it doesn't look too good. 
 This is the girl. 
 What girl? 
 The girl I told you about. 
 The girl from the basement. 
 Norman, stop it. You're making this up. 
 I told you, I went downstairs. 
 There was nobody in the basement. 
 There was nobody there. 
 Mom, open your eyes about that guy. 
 This is her. Ask her. 
 Tell her. 
 Tell her you were locked in that cop's basement. 
 He keep me-- he keep me in his house. 
 He make me have s*x. That's not true. 
 That's not true. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry, dear, I'm sorry. 
 I'm--I'm just saying that there's-- there must be some mistake. It can't be the same man. 
 It's not the same man. It's not Zack. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hold on, hold on. 
 This is not the man, right? 
 [Breathes heavily] 
 He is the man. 
 He is the man. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm--I'm sorry. 
 I told you.
