 Previously on Bates Motel... 
 Do you remember anything? 
 I've never seen anyone go into a hole like that. 
 I mean, you were, like, not there. 
 Your mom warned me not to talk about your blackouts. 
 You told her something happens to me when I black out. 
 You said I change, that I'm not myself. 
 Who am I, mother? Who am I and what do I do? 
 Here I am. Talk. 
 Zane Morgan. 
 What about him? 
 You can take him out. 
 Dylan, Nick Ford has Norman. 
 He kidnapped him. He won't tell me where he is. 
 You need to convince Dylan to do what I want him to do. 
 If you tell your friend Sheriff Romero or anyone else, Norman will be dead. 
 I couldn't get to him. 
 I'm really sorry to hear that. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Help me, please. 
 Help me. 
 Help me, please. Help me. 
 Help me, please. 
 Help me. 
 Help me, please. Help me. 
 Nick Ford's dead. I just killed him. 
 He's got Norman, but I don't know where. 
 Get in the car. 
 [Indistinct police radio chatter] 
 Stay out here. 
 We've gotta find Norman. 
 You're following instructions here. 
 You're doing what I tell you. 
 Is that clear? 
 Yeah, it's clear. 
 [Door slamming] 
 No respect for the dead, eh? 
 No, no. Stay down. 
 Hands up. Up. 
 You're Nick's security guy, aren't you? 
 What's your name? 
 Ben. 
 Ben. 
 You want to help yourself? 
 Tell me where Norman Bates is. 
 I don't know a Norman Bates. 
 [Groans] 
 Don't do that sh1t, Ben. Come on, man. It's over. 
 All of this is over. 
 You get that, right? 
 I know you do 'cause you're looting your boss's safe. 
 So don't piss me off and force me to shoot you. 
 Where's Norman Bates? 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 They must know Nick Ford got killed. 
 They've all cleared out. 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 Dylan! 
 Dylan! 
 Dylan! 
 Norman, where are you? 
 Dylan! 
 Dylan! 
 Back up, back up, back up. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Grunts] 
 We got you. 
 You're really here? 
 Yeah, it's really us. 
 You're really here? 
 Yes, of course. 
 It's us. 
 You're okay, son. 
 [Both panting] 
 You're all right. We got you out. 
 Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 Excuse me. 
 My son is in the E.R. Norman Bates? 
 Oh, he's through that door. 
 Thank you. 
 I think he's gonna be okay. 
 How'd they find him? 
 We did. I was with Romero. 
 You found him? 
 Yeah. 
 I love you, Dylan. I love you so much. 
 I'm gonna go find the doctor so he can talk to you. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Norman? 
 Norman? Sweetie? 
 Can you hear me? 
 [Whispers] Can you hear me? 
 I'm so sorry you had to go through this. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I have to... 
 I have to tell you something. 
 It was Ms. Watson's father who had me... 
 In the box, in the ground. 
 I had these dreams. 
 [Sniffles] No. 
 Norman, don't talk about it now. 
 Memories... 
 No. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Can't you tell me about the dreams later? 
 They're just dreams. 
 I want you to put it out of your head. 
 It's all over. 
 All over. 
 [Sniffles] 
 What happened? Is Norman okay? 
 He just had the stomach flu. 
 It got so bad we had to take him to the E.R. 
 But he'll be better now. 
 When did he get the stomach flu? 
 I thought yesterday you couldn't find him. 
 Well, I found him. 
 And then he got the stomach flu. 
 I'm gonna bring him to bed. 
 Okay. 
 Emma's quitting. 
 Why? 
 'Cause she said she felt left out all the time because we never tell her what's going on with our lives. 
 I mean, she's not wrong, but what could I say? 
 "Norman's been kidnapped but I can't really tell you because then they'll kill him"? 
 It's sad, but there's nothing I can do about it. 
 It sucks. I'm gonna miss her. 
 Come on, we're almost up these damn steps. 
 I'm gonna run to the market and get stuff for dinner. 
 I'll make you a pot roast. You need to get strong. 
 I'm not really hungry. 
 Yeah, well, you need to eat. 
 Can I get you something else? 
 Please rest and get better. 
 I don't know what I would've done if anything happened to you. 
 I honestly don't know. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Christine. 
 Christine? 
 Christine, I'm so sorry. 
 George just caught me at a bad time. 
 I shouldn't have have said all that stuff. 
 You know, I'm just curious. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 Am I one of those people who just "sleepwalks through life"? 
 It was out of context. I was upset. 
 You were upset? So what? 
 Does that mean you didn't say it? 
 When people are upset, they say things they don't mean. 
 Oh, I disagree. I am very upset. 
 And I do mean this. 
 How the hell dare you? 
 You were a total stranger to me and I took you into my life, my family... 
 I tried to help you. 
 I know. Christine, I know. I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I thought you had just gotten a bad rap and you needed some good friends. 
 But you are a train wreck. 
 Don't talk to me again. 
 Oh, and by the way, the mayor is coming to our house for dinner tomorrow so... 
 Let's see how that city council position works out for you. 
 [Oven door opens, squeaks closed] 
 [Exhales] 
 Dinner's ready, honey. Sit down. 
 What's wrong? 
 Christine's mad at me. 
 I yelled at George and said a bunch of stupid stuff I probably shouldn't have said. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't know how this is gonna shake out. 
 She can do a lot of damage in this town. 
 I don't know what people want from me. 
 I even went out with her brother. 
 Tried to sleep with him. 
 Anyway. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 We're together and that's all that ever matters. 
 Mmm. 
 There's something I need to tell you, mother. 
 What? 
 It's something that the Sheriff told me. 
 And something I began to realize when I was in that box. 
 Norman, he already talked to me about it, about Blaire Watson. And the... the semen sample. 
 It doesn't mean anything except that she was seducing young boys. 
 What did Romero say? 
 He... he... you know, he just insisted on you taking a polygraph test. 
 Don't worry about it. It'll be fine. 
 They ask you questions. And you answer them. 
 Yeah, but questions about what? 
 Norman, there's nothing to worry about. 
 Okay? You slept with her. You didn't kill her. 
 I think I did, mother. 
 Don't say that. 
 Why would you say that? 
 When I was in the box, I had these... these memories, of things I never remembered before. 
 Norman, you were trapped in a box in the ground. 
 You were out of your mind hallucinating. 
 No, you listen to me! 
 Okay, it wasn't a hallucination. 
 It was a memory! 
 I could feel it! It happened! 
 I can still feel it. 
 I remembered it the way you remember how gingerbread tasted at Christmas. 
 I saw myself having s*x with miss Watson. 
 And then I killed her. 
 It makes everything make sense. 
 I do things when I black out, don't I? 
 That's why you wouldn't tell me. 
 This is ridiculous, Norman. So ridiculous. 
 You're convincing yourself of something impossible. 
 You're traumatized. 
 Mother, have to face it. 
 Norman, stop it! Stop it right now! 
 Stop! 
 God. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Eat your pot roast, honey. 
 Come on, it's getting cold. 
 [Rocking chair squeaking] 
 [Tapping keys] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Approaching footsteps] 
 Hi, Alex. 
 How's... how's Norman doing? 
 He's much better. 
 Still not quite himself though. 
 Well, glad he's doing better. 
 I, uh... 
 I scheduled that polygraph test. 
 Here's the address, date, and the time. 
 This soon? He needs to rest. 
 He's been through so much. 
 No, Norma, it's got to happen. 
 I'm not happy about it, but we need to know. 
 There's enough circumstances here. 
 I can't look away. I'm sorry. 
 But I may have sent the wrong guy to prison for a crime he didn't do. 
 And I can't live with that. 
 And the only way I'm not gonna reopen this case is if he passes that test. 
 Okay. 
 [Door closes] 
 You'll be in room nine. 
 Let me know if you need anything. 
 Thank you. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Bates Motel. 
 Oh, it's me, Emma. 
 Would you mind bringing up my book? 
 I think I left it on the desk in the office. 
 Yeah. Yeah, it's right here. 
 I'll run it up to you. 
 Thanks. 
 Hi. 
 Oh. 
 Come on in. 
 How are you feeling? 
 I've been better. 
 What are you doing? 
 Just getting my things in order. 
 Shouldn't you be in bed? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Do you remember this? Thanks. 
 "Tiger, tiger, burning bright," 
 "in the forest of the night." 
 Seems like a long time ago. 
 Well, we were different people then. 
 Mom tells me you're quitting. 
 Why do you have to leave? 
 Because, Norman, it's hard being here. 
 You're such a close family. 
 And I care about you so much, but it just feels like I'm on the outside. 
 Like there's things going on that you won't tell me about. 
 We couldn't tell you that because it had something to do with Dylan. 
 Okay, it was something he wouldn't want anyone to know. 
 Except family. 
 Well, I'll tell you, Emma. 
 Just never let Dylan know because it'd kill him. 
 When my mother was a teenager, her brother raped her. 
 Dylan's their child. 
 That's why we couldn't tell you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I... your poor mother. 
 Poor Dylan. 
 I'm so sorry. I-I-I'll never... 
 I'll never tell anyone. 
 My mother loves you, Emma. 
 She loves having you here. 
 Will you please think about staying? 
 I'll think about it. 
 Good. 
 
 
 
 How do you know that? 
 Because Dylan Massett killed him. 
 [Gasps] How'd that happen? 
 How do you think it happened? 
 I worked him up into doing it. 
 And he went and he did it. 
 So now everything's changed. 
 We need to talk. 
 What about Dylan? 
 I don't care. 
 Whatever you want to do with him. 
 Cold. 
 Shut up. 
 Can you come over? 
 Yeah. 
 Can you come now? 
 Yeah. All right. 
 Okay. 
 I'll see you in a little bit. 
 [Sighs] 
 Was amazing pie, mom. 
 Thank you for making it. 
 Of course, honey. 
 I love to cook for you. 
 Alex scheduled that polygraph test. 
 Okay, then. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 I know it will. 
 I need to go upstairs. I want to wash my hair. 
 You can do that later. 
 Let's spend some time together. 
 Okay. What do you want to do?

 [dog barking in the distance] 
 All right, here we go. 
 [Dog continues barking] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 Okay, listen to me... wait right here. 
 No matter what happens, right here. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gasps] 
 You got any guns anywhere? 
 Oh, yeah, guest bedroom is where I keep all my guns. 
 [Sighs] No, but there's one downstairs, in a gun cabinet. 
 I'll go get it. 
 Jodi! 
 [Door opens] 
 [Dog barks] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Dog whimpers] 
 Yeah, I should have figured you'd do something like this. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 I helped you when no one else would, and now, you cause all this? 
 Put down the blade, Jodi. 
 I have a gun. You see that, right? 
 You don't think I'll shoot you? 
 [Floor creaks] 
 He's here with you? 
 Aah! 
 You bitch! 
 [Grunts] 
 [Thud] 
 [Footsteps approach] 
 [Shotgun racks] 
 You remember what I said? 
 About burning you down? 
 Well, I'm a man of my word. 
 [Thud] 
 What happens now? 
 All right, okay. Here's, um... 
 Here's... here's what the story's gonna be. 
 I got a tip by a confidential informant that Zane and his men, they just killed Nick Ford. 
 Then I came here to find out if Jodi had any information about where he was, and when I arrived, Zane was already here. 
 And I took out his men, but by the time I got inside the house, he had shot her before I could take him out. 
 What about me? 
 You were never here. 
 [Door opens] 
 Why are you giving me a free pass? 
 Not that I don't appreciate it. 
 Because I think you get it. 
 I think you're smart enough to understand how things work around here. What you can do, what you can't do. 
 [Sighs] 
 And right now... right now, there's a vacuum. 
 Somebody's gonna fill that vacuum. 
 That's as inevitable as the sun rising in the morning... 
 I'm not your guy. 
 I didn't sign on for any of this. 
 Well, somebody's going to, and I want to be sure that person who fills that vacuum, Dylan, understands the rules, because the rules are what make it possible for all of us to live here together in a peaceful manner. 
 Does that make sense to you? 
 Dylan? 
 Thanks for meeting me. 
 What's going on? 
 Norman had these... These memories when he was trapped in that box. 
 He thinks that he killed Blaire Watson. 
 I know, Dylan. I'm sorry to dump this on you, but you're the only one I can tell. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Romero wants him to take a polygraph test tomorrow. 
 He's gonna ask him if he killed Blaire Watson. 
 Norman's gonna go to prison. 
 He... that can't happen. 
 Can you imagine Norman in prison? 
 He'll just dissolve. 
 [Sighs] 
 It just... it's not his fault. 
 He doesn't even know he does these things. 
 I bought tickets to Montreal, to fly. 
 We can leave tonight. 
 You can't do that. That's insane. 
 I don't know what else to do. [Crying] 
 I got three tickets. I want you to come. 
 You bought me a ticket? 
 I'm sorry, Dylan. 
 I'm so sorry, for everything. 
 For how you were born, how I handled it. 
 How I shut you out... it was horrible of me, and I'm so sorry. 
 It's not your fault, Norma. You were just a kid. 
 I didn't know what I was doing, but as horrible as it was, I-I wouldn't trade it for anything, because you're here now, and you're beautiful, and you're a miracle, that someone like you could come out of all that. 
 And I wouldn't give you up for anything. 
 Listen to me. 
 You can't leave town. 
 He... he's innocent. He doesn't know. 
 Then he's mentally ill. 
 They'll send him to an institution... 
 I don't want him in an institution. 
 If he did this thing, then... 
 He needs to be somewhere he can be protected. 
 At least, someplace other people are protected. 
 You need to know the truth, Norma. 
 If you really love him, then... 
 If you really love him and you want to protect him, then he needs to take the test. 
 Norman, I'm home! 
 Norman? 
 Norman? 
 Norman? 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 Have you seen Norman? 
 I-I just saw him. 
 He said he was taking a walk in the woods. 
 He just headed across the street. 
 How long ago? 
 Right before your car pulled up. 
 [Car honking] 
 [Panting] 
 Norman! 
 [Panting] 
 [Panting] 
 Unh! [Grunts] 
 Norman! 
 [Grunting] 
 Where are you? 
 Norman! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Grunting, panting] 
 Norman, come back here! 
 [Grunting] 
 Stop! 
 Stop. 
 [Both grunting] 
 I'm sorry, mother. 
 I didn't mean to hurt you. 
 But I am gonna do this, and you're not gonna stop me. 
 Why? 
 'Cause I don't want to be who I am. 
 [Weakly] Why? 
 And I don't want to hurt you. 
 There's something wrong with me. I'm bad. 
 You're not bad! You're innocent. 
 You've never meant to hurt anybody in your life. 
 But I did. I know I did. 
 You don't know what's real and what's not, Norman. 
 You have these blackouts, and they confuse you. 
 I had a blackout the day my dad died. 
 What happened that day, mother? 
 Give me the gun and I'll tell you. 
 [Sighs] 
 He was hurting me, and you were trying to protect me. 
 You've always been there to protect me. 
 How can you ask me to live with this? 
 Because I will die if you leave. 
 I will, I'll die, Norman. 
 We're like the same person. 
 If you kill yourself, I'll be there one step after. 
 We have to be together. We're supposed to be together. 
 No matter what, I will be with you every step. 
 I will be right by your side, and we will face this together. 
 Please. [Whimpers] Please. 
 Please. 
 [Sniffles] [Softly] Please. 
 All right, mother. 
 You win. 
 [Windshield wipers thumping] 
 We're ready to go. 
 All right. 
 Uh, yeah, Norma, Dylan, why don't you wait right here? 
 Okay. 
 Go ahead, Norman. We'll be right here. 
 I love you. 
 [Sighs] It's gonna be okay. 
 All right. Let's go. 
 Is your name Norman Bates? 
 Yes. 
 Do you live in White Pine Bay? 
 Yes. 
 Do you intend to answer each question truthfully? 
 Yes. 
 Did you ever tell a lie to someone who trusted you? 
 Yes. 
 Have you ever stolen money? 
 Yes. 
 Did you know a woman named Blaire Watson? 
 Yes. 
 Have you ever had s*x with one of your teachers? 
 Yes. 
 Was this teacher Blaire Watson? 
 Yes. 
 Have you ever physically harmed another person? 
 Yes. 
 Have you ever withheld informations from others regarding a crime? 
 Yes. 
 Did you kill Blaire Watson? 
 Norman. 
 Norman. 
 Norman, you need to know something very important. 
 What, mother? 
 You didn't kill Blaire Watson. 
 I did. 
 You did? 
 Yes. 
 You have to keep this a secret. 
 Do you promise? 
 I promise. 
 I will always be there for you. 
 I will always protect you, no matter what. 
 Remember that. 
 Norman. 
 Norman. 
 Yes? 
 Did you hear my question? 
 No. 
 Did you kill Blaire Watson? 
 He passed. 
 What exactly does that mean? 
 In my opinion, Norman Bates did not kill Blaire Watson.
