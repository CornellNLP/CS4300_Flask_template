 Previously on Bates Motel...  
 Norman, can I tell you something that I've never told anybody? 
 Yeah. What? 
 My brother used to make me have s*x with him. 
 And it went on until he moved out. 
 I'm so sorry, mother. 
 I'm looking for a place called Bates Motel. 
 I'm looking for my sister. 
 Who's your sister? 
 Norma Bates. 
 [gunshot] 
 I need to know that what you're doing makes sense. 
 I killed the guy that killed my dad. 
 Dylan I need you to listen to me. 
 I lied to you. I do know what happened to Bradley. 
 She's hiding in our basement. 
 What? 
 She's ready to be driven to Cold Creek to get on a bus that leaves in two hours. 
 It'll take her to Boston where she's gonna start her life over. 
 She's on the bus. 
 Thank you. 
 This is for you. 
 Hi. 
 Want some cereal? 
 No. 
 Have you seen the paper today? 
 They, um... 
 They found some of Bradley's clothes and a suicide note near the rocks on Gilmer Beach. 
 I'm so sorry, Norman. This is awful. 
 Thanks. Um... 
 It's okay. 
 I'm okay. 
 Are you? 
 Because I don't think I am. 
 I mean, I felt bad before, But when I saw this, I... 
 I can't believe how bad I feel now. 
 Why? It's not like you guys were actually friends. 
 I know. 
 That's why I was so worried about you. 
 I mean, if I feel like this, I can't imagine how it must be for you. 
 Well, I better get down to the office. 
 But if you want to talk, then you know where I am. 
 So sorry, Norman. 
 Me too. 
 Don't... 
 Yeah, you can leave it. 
 Sure. Okay. 
 See you later. 
 Norma Bates. I was gonna call you. 
 I am so sorry. 
 About what? 
 That these jerk-offs wouldn't let me give you the lead, which you seriously should've gotten. 
 [sighs] Don't worry about it. 
 Not only am I worried about it, I quit. 
 They can direct their own stupid lame-ass community musical. 
 You don't need to quit. 
 Oh, no, I do, actually, because apparently casting is up to Jocelyn Kirby and Jocelyn wants her friend Libby Porter to have the part instead of you because she's an idiot. 
 So... anyway, so I quit. 
 I'm sorry that you had to quit. 
 Oh, don't be. 
 If it wasn't this, it'd be something else. 
 I have better things to do with my time, like stick red-hot needles in my eyes. 
 Well, I'm sorry about the part. 
 You deserved it. 
 Hey, can I at least buy you a drink? 
 That would be so nice, but it's... it's not even 11:00 in the morning. 
 Oh, good. That means the bars are open. 
 Okay. [chuckles] 
 So, Norma, how do you like it here so far? 
 Uh, well, parts of it have been really good. 
 Thank you. 
 The motel's going gangbusters right now. 
 Mm. 
 But there's... 
 It's been weird. 
 There was thing that happened shortly after we moved in. 
 Oh. That deputy who got shot up? 
 What a terrible thing to go through. 
 Yeah, it was. 
 And I just feel that... that some people here think that what Shelby did as a business, how he died, even though I had nothing to do with it, that somehow, it reflects on me. 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. Some of them think that. 
 But they're just idiots with nothing better to do, not anyone you'd want to spend any time with. 
 I think you went through something terrible, and you handled it with incredible bravery. 
 Just promise me one thing... 
 You won't give a rat's ass what some people think or say. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I'll try. 
 You're one of the most interesting people I've met in this town, and I cannot wait to introduce you around. 
 Hey. 
 Where do you want the viburnum? 
 She didn't say. 
 Just put it wherever it's not gonna die. 
 Hey, I'm looking for Norma Bates. 
 Okay. 
 Is she around? 
 No. 
 Is she coming back soon? 
 Why? 
 Well, I'll come back later. 
 Maybe she'll be here then. 
 Yeah, and I'll still be here too. 
 So why don't you just say what you want? 
 What's the deal here? You her son? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm her brother. 
 Norma doesn't have a brother. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 No. 
 She never talked about me to you. 
 Never even mentioned she had a brother. 
 [scoffs] Some things never change. 
 Norma, man, it's been so long. 
 I thought about this moment so many times, but now that I'm actually looking at you... 
 You cannot be here. 
 No, no, Norma, don't say that. 
 You have to leave. 
 What's going on? 
 Five minutes, just... just five minutes. 
 Look, please, Norma, I understand. 
 Don't make me go. Not yet, please? 
 [screams] Get out! 
 What was that? 
 Don't ever let him back in here. 
 Ever. 
 [vacuum hums] 
 Mother. 
 Mother, do we know what the deal is with that play yet? 
 This just isn't picking anything up at all. 
 I think it's broken. 
 What? 
 The play. 
 You know, like when rehearsals start or whatever. 
 We're not doing it. 
 We're not? 
 Did we not get parts? 
 I did not get one, no. 
 You did. You're in the chorus. 
 You want to be in the chorus? 
 No. 
 I didn't even want to do it in the first place, so... 
 No, you didn't. And you were right. 
 Theater's stupid, so we're not doing it. 
 [vacuum humming] 
 [shuts off vacuum] 
 Mother, what's wrong? 
 My brother Caleb was here. 
 What? 
 Just out of nowhere, he just showed up. 
 What did he want? 
 I don't care. I threw him out. 
 Well, how did he find us? 
 You can find anyone these days. 
 I don't know how. Everyone else seems to. 
 [sighs] 
 [vacuum hums] 
 I shouldn't have told you. 
 It's nothing. It's not important. 
 He's gone, so forget about it. 
 I'm fine. 
 Norman, I'm trying to vacuum! 
 Zane's crazy. 
 He's gonna be a disaster. We're all gonna wind up dead. 
 Will you shut up? 
 [crows caw] 
 [cawing] 
 [guns click] 
 [flies buzzing] 
 At least now we know what they're gonna do about Zane killing Johnny. 
 [overlapping chatter] 
 Hey. 
 How'd the hair dye turn out? 
 Fine. 
 How'd that work? Your mom's a blonde. 
 Well, yeah, I just accidentally got the wrong color. [chuckles] 
 So what about you? 
 Are you ready to sing your little heart out in the chorus or what? 
 I actually came here to tell someone I'm dropping out. 
 How come you're quitting, quitter? 
 I'm just not that into it. That's all. 
 Because your mom didn't get a part? 
 She totally should have. She was really good. 
 But you don't want to do it without her? 
 Is that it? 
 I... no, I didn't want to do it in the first place, so... 
 Yeah, you didn't. Musicals are ass. 
 Tech is fun as sh1t, though. It's all painting and lifting. 
 It's practical. You get ripped. 
 Plus everyone gets drunk backstage. 
 You should do tech. 
 Why? 
 I just said why. 
 But also, it's summer, and it's White Pine Bay. 
 So what else are you gonna do? [chuckles] 
 You're still here, huh? 
 Yeah, non-refundable ticket. Fly out Tuesday. 
 So I'll hang out here a few days, see the Oregon sights before I fly home. 
 I'm sorry to put you in the middle of all that. 
 No, it's cool. 
 No, I should've known that was gonna happen. 
 It's Norma... You know? 
 But I'm an optimist at heart. 
 Anyway, it was good meeting you. 
 Why is she so mad you anyways? 
 Ah, you know how families are. 
 Things that happen years and years ago, it's like they're yesterday. 
 You don't need to be loaded down with all that. 
 Yeah. 
 So what are you gonna do till Tuesday? 
 Thought maybe I'd go fishing. 
 There's great fly-fishing here in Oregon. 
 Your granddad talked about fishing the Williamson river and the Umpqua. 
 He used to tie his own flies. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I always kind of wondered how you do that. 
 Yeah, I never got the hang of it, but I still got a boxful of his. 
 I brought 'em with me. 
 We could maybe go find a river to stand in. 
 I'm... I'm kind of busy today. 
 Hey, no worries. 
 But maybe we could... 
 We could maybe grab some dinner tonight. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 If you want. 
 It's cool. 
 You got a phone? 
 Yeah. 
 Now you know where to find me. 
 Cool. 
 All right. 
 Take care, bud. 
 All right. 
 See you. 
 [tapping keys] 
 Mother, are you all right? 
 Yes, I'm all right. Stop asking if I'm all right. 
 Sorry. I just want to run something by you. 
 What? 
 I know you didn't get in the play, and you should have. 
 Oh, stop it. 
 Well, no, it was something we were supposed to do together. 
 But... 
 What, you want to go sing  in some chorus of South Pacific now? 
 No. 
 I... Went down to quit, and I spoke to some of the tech people, and they need help building sets. 
 Just, it's, you know, practical and... 
 Painting, lifting... you get in good shape and you learn a skill, things like that. 
 You never mentioned you like building things. 
 I like doing taxidermy. It's sort of "building" stuff, Just rebuilding something you take apart first. 
 Hmm. 
 No... okay. 
 I think it'd be very good for you. 
 What are those? 
 [sighs] 
 It's for Bradley, for a Memorial Day at the beach. 
 Just a very casual bonfire and flowers type of thing. 
 I thought maybe people could say things they remember about her if they wanted. 
 I mean, obviously, her family will do something major. 
 I just wanted to rally a group of people she went to school with, like her friends and... 
 It's a lovely idea, Emma. 
 I think it's a very nice thing to do. 
 It's very meaningful. 
 [phone chimes] 
 [murmurs] 
 Hello? 
 Norma, it's Christine Heldens. 
 Guess what you're doing this afternoon. 
 What? 
 Coming to my garden party. 
 It starts at 3:00, and you're coming because I'm gonna introduce you to some nice people. 
 There's just a lot of stuff going on here. 
 I... 
 You're coming. 
 I am? Okay. 
 [chuckles] Thank you. 
 I can't wait to introduce you to the real White Pine Bay. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 [rock music playing] 
 [music stops] 
 So Paco and Tony. Doing them as what... 
 Payback for us taking out Johnny? 
 Is that it? 
 Is that the message? 
 I think that's pretty likely. 
 Okay. 
 What would you do about it? 
 Just tell me. 
 I don't think I'd do anything. 
 I think I'd just stop. 
 It's a zero-sum game. you just win until you lose again. 
 It never ends. 
 I'd just concentrate on having the best product and moving it. 
 That's all. 
 I agree. That's very important. 
 I also think that if they thought that Johnny was worth two of our guys, then two of our guys is worth ten of their guys or maybe twelve. 
 Or however many I can get in one place at one time. 
 And that right there, that's very important too. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I don't know. 
 Don't worry. I'll figure it out. 
 [engine turns] 
 [rock music plays] 
 Zane took over for Gil, for what, a little less than a week now? 
 Here we are... burying Tony and Paco. 
 How do you like those odds? 
 I don't, Remo. 
 Why don't you tell me what I can do about it. 
 That's what I thought. 
 Come on. 
 [shovel clatters] 
 [mumbling under breath] 
 [mutters] 
 You're always saying things like I'm supposed to be alarmed and I should do something. 
 What the hell can we do, huh? 
 Nothing. 
 There's nothing we can do. 
 We're stuck, so quit saying that sh1t. 
 Fine. 
 [door closes] 
 [footsteps] 
 What happened to you? 
 Uh, I had to do some planting. 
 Take off those clothes. Leave them there by the door. 
 I'll wash them first thing tomorrow. 
 Thanks. 
 I wanted to say that I feel bad about yesterday, about bringing your brother here, and we haven't talked since. 
 Well, there's nothing to talk about. 
 Well, seems like there might be something. 
 Fine. 
 Okay, maybe I need to talk. 
 Or I want to. 
 I want to understand what was going on there. 
 Nothing's going on. 
 You were angry, and you were upset. 
 Maybe I can help. 
 Help with what? 
 With anything. With whatever was upsetting you or is upsetting you. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 No, right. 
 Sure. 
 You never do. 
 You never know what I'm talking about. you never tell me sh1t. 
 But something happened with you and your brother, Norma. 
 What was it, huh? 
 I have to get dressed. I'm gonna be late. 
 You want to worry about someone's brother so bad, worry about your own. He needs a ride to the beach. 
 [slams door] 
 
 
 
 [soft jazz music] 
 [distant chatter] 
 Good afternoon. 
 Hi. 
 [overlapping chatter] 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 Oh, my God, I'm so happy you're here! 
 Hi. 
 Okay, we're making specialty drinks. 
 I recommend the peach Martini. 
 I'm only gonna introduce you to people that I would really want to talk to. 
 You look very pretty. Let's do this thing. 
 Excuse me, everyone. Sorry, I'm barging in. 
 This is Joanna, this is Lori. 
 Hi. 
 This is Kenny and Cat, and this is George. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, George. 
 Everyone, this is Norma Bates. 
 She just moved here not too long ago, so make her feel at home. 
 Can I steal you for a moment? 
 Oh. 
 Yes, this is my husband, Peter, and apparently we are out of tonic water, and I will be right back. 
 [chuckles] 
 So you just moved here? From where? 
 Arizona. 
 Oh. 
 Are you originally from Arizona? 
 No, not originally. 
 We moved there before my son was born. 
 We went for my husband's work. 
 Oh. Is he here too? 
 Actually, he passed away this last year. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 Had he been sick? 
 No, it was unexpected. 
 He was in a car accident. 
 It's okay. Sorry. 
 It's fine. 
 I-I got to say, I love Arizona. 
 You've only been to the Grand Canyon. 
 You love the Grand Canyon. 
 Me too. I love it too. I love it. 
 I love the Grand Canyon. 
 Well, you didn't. 
 No, I did not. 
 I was constantly afraid that I was just gonna spontaneously fall in. 
 Oh, but you don't have to worry, really. 
 Statistically, most of the people who actually fall in the Grand Canyon do it because they do that thing where they're pretending to fall in the Grand Canyon, like, right before it happens. 
 You know, "honey, take a picture. 
 This is gonna be hilari... aah!" 
 [laughter] 
 [giggling continues] That's true.

 Who cares about Bradley? Just pound some more beers. 
 I'm sorry. You tried to do something nice. 
 Well, you shouldn't be. 
 I was only doing it to make myself feel better, and it didn't even work. 
 Maybe that's because God or the universe or whoever knows the truth. 
 Which is what? 
 That I'm a bad person. 
 Why? 
 Because she's dead, and I still don't like her.

 Hey. 
 You're here. 
 Oh, hey. Yeah. 
 Sorry, I-I didn't expect to see you. 
 So did... did you know Bradley? 
 No. 
 I just heard there was beer here. 
 Oh. 
 Damn. You actually knew her. 
 We were, uh... 
 Pretty close. 
 Cody. 
 Norman, this is Philip. Philip, this is Norman. 
 I didn't think you'd be here. Hey. 
 Let's go find the keg. 
 Come on, have a beer with us. 
 What was he on disability for? 
 Well, at the tire factory, they have these big molds, you know. 
 And after you cured the tires, you had to strip it out of the mold. 
 Anyway, he tore something or wrenched something. 
 Just never got right again. 
 So he couldn't work? 
 Some days he probably could've, but once he got used to sitting around at home drinking... 
 Did your mom work? 
 Nah. 
 We probably call it... Depression or bipolar something now, But Frannie wasn't what you call present too much. 
 Frannie. 
 Ray and Frannie. 
 Norma really never told you any of this? 
 She told me some things. Not a lot. 
 And the stuff she did tell me, well, I'm never sure what was true. 
 You know, the Norma Louise I remember would get close, and then she'd get closer, and then you'd be as close as two people could possibly be... 
 Then suddenly you'd be out. 
 So what have you been doing all this time? 
 Where do you live? 
 Costa Rica. 
 In Costa Rica? 
 [laughs] Yeah. 
 I have these friends, a married couple, and they own this funky hotel resort on this fantastic piece of property. 
 You been down there? 
 To Costa Rica? 
 Yeah. 
 No, but I hear it's amazing though. 
 But so my friends, they're getting a divorce... 
 Amicable, you know. 
 But they need to cash out to split up. 
 So they'll sell, which they really want to do, and if I get the money together, they'll sell it to me for about 60% of what it's actually worth. 
 That's a good opportunity. 
 Right? 
 Plus they want to sell it to someone they know, you know, Who can run it in the same spirit that they did. 
 That sounds awesome. 
 Yeah. 
 When they offered, I thought it was a gift from God out of nowhere, Something Norma could be a part of too... 
 You know, a reward I could bring her for what we went through. 
 You know, I thought enough time had gone by that she could finally hear me. 
 What do you mean? What did you go through? 
 I kept waiting to grow up, get bigger than him, but it just never happened. 
 You know, I mean, for all I knew, every family was like ours anyway. 
 But I'm a man now, so I get it, you know, how worthless he must've felt. 
 But I wasn't a man then, and Norma sure wasn't. 
 And he just took it out on us. 
 Oh... 
 Such a pretty little kid. 
 Such a trusting girl, and I couldn't protect her. 
 I mean, she wants to forget it happened, forget me, and I get that. She wants to blame me. 
 I mean, I blame me too. I always have. 
 Then I heard she was in the hotel business now. 
 I don't know. It just... 
 [pouring beer] It seemed like fate. 
 But a lot of things seem like fate, and they're not. 
 Maybe some things are. 
 [jazzy piano music] 
 [distant voices] 
 Hey. 
 Christine sent me out to check on you. 
 She's stuck talking to a couple of Peter's investors. 
 That's nice of both of you. Thanks, I'm fine. 
 I'm just getting some air. 
 Oh, also, they just put out the desserts, and I didn't want you to get screwed out of having any. 
 Those people in there are remorseless eating machines. 
 I personally recommend this raspberry thing or this nutty chocolate blob. 
 The raspberry thing... 
 [clears throat] 
 So have you known Christine long? 
 Yeah. Yeah, you could say that. 
 I'm her brother. 
 Oh, you don't say? 
 [chuckles] 
 I thought I should probably bring that up before it got a little weird. 
 Oh. 
 She didn't actually send me out here to check up on you. 
 Well, she did, but she also told me to be thoughtful and charming and to not talk about my divorce, so there's that. 
 I see. 
 Yeah. [chuckles] 
 I see. Does she try to set you up often? 
 Uh, no. Never, actually. 
 Which says something about you. 
 Or else it says something about me. 
 I don't... [laughs] 
 I'm gonna let myself think it's you. 
 That's very flattering. 
 But I hope you know that It's... it's flattering, but I just... 
 Haven't even been a widow a year. 
 I know. I told her. 
 Look, that's totally fine. 
 I don't... 
 No, I just... I don't even remember how to date, honestly, if I ever knew. 
 Look, I'll just tell her we had a really nice talk and that I think I should take things slow, and she'll be none the wiser. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Have another cookie? 
 [both laugh] 
 There you go. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. Cupcake boy. 
 Remember me? I remember you. 
 Yeah, from the Motel. What's up? 
 You're selling weed. 
 Well, it's not a beach party without some sticky. 
 Am I right? 
 It's not a beach party. 
 It's a memorial for somebody who died. 
 And people are sad, and they want to feel happy again. 
 Oh, okay. Whatever. Who cares? 
 I don't care about that or this or whatever. 
 Yeah, come here. 
 Come on. 
 We're not dead, okay? 
 We're alive, so we should live, but we're gonna die, you know. 
 Okay, yeah. Like right now? 
 Yeah. Let's do something cra... 
 Let's just... let's just go completely crazy. 
 [laughs] 
 All right. What'd you have in mind? 
 Bad choices. 
 Make bad choices with me. 
 [Eagles of Death Metal's I Only Want You] 
 You know... there's nothing like a memorial where there's drunk guys peeing in the bonfire. 
 I hope I get a send-off like that. 
 Idiots. 
 You have the best hair. 
 Is that right? 
 Do you know that? 
 It's like bushy and smooth. 
 Tell me about it. 
 I don't feel too good. 
 How many of those drinks did I... 
 You know how many of those drinks that I had? 
 I have no idea. 
 Well, I don't drink, so I didn't keep count. 
 Come on. I'll get you home. 
 That sounds like a good idea.

 Evening, ma'am. 
 Evening. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Norma Bates, right? 
 Yes. 
 You're the one who let everybody have it at the last city council meeting about the bypass. 
 Were you there? 
 No. I heard about it. 
 Congratulations. 
 Not many people would have the guts to do that. 
 [chuckles] 
 Are you in favor of the bypass? 
 No. 
 Well, then why weren't you at the council meeting? 
 I could've used your help. 
 I can't. 
 Small-town politics. 
 You have to get along with everybody on the playground, you know? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 [motor hums] 
 Well, good evening. 
 Good evening. 
 Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
 Oh! Excuse me, I'm sorry. 
 I just haven't met anyone else against the bypass and also who seems to know how things work in this town. 
 Could I possibly buy you a coffee sometime, pick your brain a little? 
 Sure. 
 Give me a call. 
 I will. Thank you. 
 [laid-back rock music] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What, are you kidding me? Is this 10k? 
 It's 11 1/2. 
 You giving me all this? You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not known for my brilliant decisions, but yeah. Yeah. 
 And I can probably make it 15 in the next couple months. 
 Where'd you come from, kid? Damn, you're too much. 
 You know, I was thinking too. 
 I'm gonna talk to my mom and get her to at least let you tell her why you came here. 
 I think it'd be good for her and it'd be good for everybody else. 
 Hey, well, if you want to talk to her, I want to let you. 
 Right now, you just need to tell me when you can make it to Costa Rica. 
 Tell you what, I'm ready to go there right now, man. 
 [both chuckle] 
 I-I, uh, I think I need to tell you something. 
 What? 
 What? Say it. 
 I think your boyfriend might be gay. 
 [mockingly gasps] 
 You knew? 
 [laughs] Please! 
 What... 
 You can see it from space. 
 And he's not my boyfriend. 
 Well, you were making out with him, so... 
 Gosh, Norman, like you've never been to a party before? 
 Besides, aren't you? 
 Aren't I what? 
 Gay? No. [laughs] 
 No. No, I'm not gay. 
 Well, I just thought you were. 
 And then we just saw you there, and Philip thought you were cute, so... 
 Well, I'm sorry, well, for him. 
 But, uh, no. 
 No, I'm... I'm not gay. 
 Okay, fine. Poor Philip. 
 And honestly, maybe you should get out more then 'cause your whole thing is really confusing. 
 You make out with gay guys for no reason. 
 That's pretty confusing too. 
 There's always a reason to make out, Norman. 
 You don't have to take everything so seriously. 
 I don't have to. I want to. 
 Is this where you live? 
 Yeah. 
 Your parents home? 
 My dad is. 
 It's just him. 
 I left my window open. I can get in that way. 
 Oh, were you not supposed to go out? 
 No, I can go out. 
 I'll see you tomorrow at tech, right? 
 Uh-huh. 
 I heard we have to paint 60 happy little trees. 
 [laughs] 
 [clattering] 
 Mom... 
 He's a nice guy. 
 Who is? 
 Your brother. 
 He's still in town. He's over at King's. 
 He told me what happened, what you went through, what your dad did to you guys. 
 He said he didn't do anything to try and stop it, to protect you. 
 He says you're right to blame him, but... 
 He'd do anything to make things better. 
 Would he? Would he really? 
 I don't know how you survived it. 
 I knew you were strong, but it must've been so hard. 
 You must've been so angry. 
 You must be so angry. 
 But he's your brother. He's your family. 
 I kn exactly who he is and what he is. 
 He raped me, Dylan. 
 He raped me over and over every day for years. 
 You're unbelievable Norma, you know that? 
 I never met this man before yesterday, never even knew that I had an Uncle. 
 But already he's been nicer to me than you've ever been, told me more than you ever have. 
 He raped me, Dylan! 
 I don't believe you! 
 Get out of my house! 
 You'd say anything to get your own way. 
 My own way? 
 I have never gotten my own way, ever, and that includes being your damn mother! 
 You don't like him, and you don't want me to! 
 He didn't rape you! 
 You weren't there! You don't know! 
 I don't need to be. I've lived with you. 
 I know what you're made of, what you do to get your way! 
 He raped me, and I had no one to protect me! 
 You're a liar! 
 Get away from her! 
 Norman, it's not his fault! He can't help it! 
 It is his fault! I'm not gonna let him hurt you! 
 She's lying! Can't you see? 
 Norman, stop it! Stop it! 
 He can't help it! It's his dad! 
 [sniffles] 
 Caleb is his dad. 
 [crying] 
 I'm sorry.
