 Previously on  Bates Motel... 
 [Dog barking] 
 I mean, we can't take on a dog right now. 
 I always wanted a dog. I mean, all families have a dog. 
 Could you tell me what happened to the Seafarer Motel? 
 It's the Bates Motel now. 
 You know where I can find Keith Summers? 
 He's actually dead. 
 There's nothing more to tell you. 
 That's the entire truth. 
 Everything that happened with Keith Summers, with Deputy Shelby... you know it all. 
 Someone in the motel? 
 This man, he had a standing reservation at the Seafarer every two months for a week. 
 I'd love to have the same business arrangement that I had with Keith, if that's possible. 
 There's not anything illegal, right? 
 No. 
 Come here, girl. 
 [Dog whimpering] 
 [Car approaching] 
 Stay! Stay! 
 The art of it is to recreate the beauty of motion in something still. 
 To create life, if you will. 
 Here is where we'll make incisions. 
 Then what do you do? 
 Well, then you have to take everything out. 
 I'm sorry. There's no pretty way to put it. 
 Oh, no, that's okay. I figured as much. 
 Now... 
[Clears throat] here are some of the various stages of how it works. 
 I'm sorry you lost your friend here. 
 It just seems sad to let her go. 
 You know, dishonorable, sort of, just to put her in the ground. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I think she was lonely. 
 I understand. 
 Well, I think what you do to these animals is... amazing. 
 Come and help me. 
 I can teach you how it works. You might enjoy it. 
 Once you get past the blood and the guts of it all, it's really quite beautiful work, if you're at all artistic, which I have a feeling you might be. 
 Thank you, Mr. Decody. 
 [Coughing] 
 [Sprays inhaler, gasps] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Girls giggling] 
 I feel so bad for him. 
 He's always just staring at her like a lost puppy. 
 Yeah, it's a little pathetic. 
 He's a little pathetic. 
 Yeah, Norman's nice, but he's really weird. 
 The way he just stares into space like that. 
 He's the definition of socially challenged. 
 I mean, he can't actually think he has a shot with her, right? 
 He's not that out of reality. 
 Bradley's so nice. 
 She just felt sorry for him. 
 I think she thinks of him as more of pet than a guy. 
 Like, really, like she would ever have s*x with someone like that. 
 No way. He can't be that stupid. 
 Well, maybe you better talk to her... because she did. 
 I don't think you know what we're talking about. 
 Actually, I don't think you know what you're talking about. 
 Bradley had s*x with Norman. 
 s*x, as in carnal-back-and-forth. 
 Maybe she has s*x with all her pets. 
 I don't know. 
 But you should really get your facts straight before you shoot your mouth off with your demeaning opinions. 
 And you've got toilet paper on your shoe. 
 Hmm. 
 Sheriff Romero's office. 
 Hello. 
 Can I speak with Sheriff Romero, please? 
 Who may I say is calling? 
 Norma Bates. 
 Hold, please. 
[Hold music playing] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I'm sorry. I don't have him right now. 
 Well, can you please leave a message that I called? 
 He knows me. 
 Of course. 
 Can you spell your last name for me, please? 
 Bates. B-a-t-e-s. 
 Bates. 
 [Cell phone buzzing] 
 Hey, it's Dylan. 
 Yeah, we just brought in the harvest from the Red Creek field. 
 I need you and Remo to go down to California and pick up the trimmers. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 It's all set up. 
 They'll be waiting for you tomorrow. 
 3:00 P.M., Twin Eagles Motel in Fortuna. 
 Yeah, um, what exactly are trimmers? 
 [Chuckles] Yeah, get Remo to explain it to you. 
 He's made the run about 20 times. 
 It was Gil. 
 He wants us to go down to Fortuna and pick up the trimmers. 
 What exactly are trimmers? Really? 
 You don't know what a trimmer is? 
 Why don't you explain it to me? 
 [Sighs] How about I don't? 
 Here comes Ronny and Don. 
 I'll get the van. You can pack up. 
 Wait, wait. Pack what? 
 It's an overnight trip, Nimrod. 
 Pack a change of clothes, or not. 
 You want me to come over and tell you what to wear? 
 Okay, let's-- let's just go. 
 Hey, yo! Let's go! 
 [Students chattering] 
 Why did you tell everyone? 
 Tell everyone what? 
 About you and I-- what happened that night. 
 I didn't tell anyone. 
 You told Emma Decody, because she told everyone in the girls' bathroom. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I-I don't know why she would do that. 
 Listen, it's just not cool, Norman. 
 Okay, but why isn't it? 
 I mean, it happened, right? 
 Yeah, but it shouldn't have. 
 We need to forget about it. 
 I have a boyfriend, okay? 
 I don't want people to know. 
 Just forget it happened. 
 Norman? 
 Excuse me, Norman. 
 What is going on? 
 I have to leave. 
 Why? 
 I just have to. 
 Well, do you have a note? 
 You have to have a note. 
 Norman, you cannot just walk away from school and leave. 
 You'll get cited. You'll get suspended. 
 I don't care! 
 Norman. 
 Just come back inside, and we can-- 
 [whistling] 
 [Sighs] Housekeeping. 
 Morning. I wasn't sure what time you wanted me to come and clean the room. Will you be leaving soon? 
 You can come in and clean it now--that's fine. 
 Oh, no, that's okay. 
 I'll come back later when you're gone. 
 Actually... I'd like my room made up now. 
 I was in town last night. I... heard there was an unpleasant incident here recently. 
 A dog got hit out front. 
 No. 
 I heard Zack Shelby got shot here. 
 Right up there on those steps. 
 Yeah, he did. 
 It's funny. You never know someone. 
 I knew Keith Summers all these years. 
 Not well, but I knew him. 
 And here he was-- he's in the motel for this... s*x trade. 
 You just never know, do you? 
 Yeah, I guess you don't. 
 [Gasps] Oh! 
 [Shattering sound] 
 Sorry about that. 
 I'll grab a bulb from another room. 
 It's no worries. 
 Did you know Zack Shelby? 
 Did I know him? 
 A little. 
 I guess like how you knew Keith Summers. 
 So not so much? 
 No, not so much. 
 I'm sorry. I have to, um-- 
 I just remembered. 
 I have to give my son a ride somewhere. 
 He's not here. Yeah. 
 Yeah, I saw him leave. 
 School, wasn't it? 
 I got to go. 
 I'm gonna come back, and I'll finish up later, okay? 
 [Muttering] 
I just--just... 
 We're good for now. 
 If I need anything else, I'll come by the office. 
 Sure. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Sheriff Romero can see you now. 
 So what can I help you with, Mrs. Bates? 
 Oh, please, call me Norma, after everything we've been through... 
 You know that I called your office this morning. 
 You know, I was coming in town anyway. 
 I thought, oh, I'll just pop in and see him. 
 So anyway, um... you know, I bought the motel a few months ago, and no one told me at the time that the city's planning on building a new bypass that would basically take my motel off the map. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So I'm just trying to figure out a way that, um, I can fight this from the inside. 
 Well, I, um, I see that there's a seat open on the city planning committee, and I wanted you to put me forward for it. 
 Maybe I can influence their decision. 
 Why would I do that? 
 Be...cause I thought you would. 
 Why? 
 Because... because of what we've been through. 
 Because... we know things about each other. 
 We don't owe each other anything. 
 We're not friends. 
 You don't know me in any social sense, other than as your sheriff. 
 Don't assume differently just 'cause I was kind enough to save your ass once. 
 Excuse me, but weren't you saving your own ass at the time? 
 I mean, the fact is that your deputy was doing all of this right under your nose, and you knew nothing about it. 
 I mean, that's not how you rewrote the story. 
 Are you trying to say that you have something on me? 
 Is that it? 
 'Cause if you did, that really wouldn't be good for you, okay? 
 I mean, I might have to... burn you down to the ground, you know? 
 Don't ever try to intimidate me. 
 Don't walk into my office and ask me for political favors based on nothing. 
 You and I have no connection. 
 We're not on the same playing field. 
 Don't ever assume that we are. 
 You don't know what you're doing. 
 Go home, Mrs. Bates. 
 [Cell phone buzzing] 
 Hello? 
 Mrs. Bates? 
 Yes. 
 This is Tom Hudgins. 
 I'm the principal of White Pine Bay High School. 
 I'd like you to come in this afternoon. 
 We need to discuss your son's behavior at school. 
 Can you go on the Internet, find out what a trimmer is? 
 Yeah. 
 Trimmers are the guys who cut and process the weed, and they turn the raw plants into final product. 
 The man's a scholar. 
 No rust on you, Bubba. Come on, get in. 
 Hey. 
 I didn't see you at school today. 
 Oh, I wasn't feeling good. I went home early. 
 Are you okay? 
 Why did you tell all the girls I slept with Bradley? 
 It just came up. 
 Sort of. 
 Just like it came up with my mom? 
 Did your mom tell you that? 
 No, she didn't have to. 
 I just don't understand. 
 Wh-what're you trying to do? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Bradley was really upset. 
 Don't ever tell anyone something I tell you in confidence again, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Leaving school without permission is a serious offense. 
 He's gonna be suspended for three days. 
 Well, he came home. 
 He just wasn't feeling that well. 
 He didn't seem sick when I saw him. 
 He seemed upset. 
 No, he wasn't upset. 
 Well, I tried to tell him that he couldn't leave campus, and he was practically shaking. 
 I took his arm to lead him back in, and he pulled it away pretty violently. 
 Are you supposed to be putting your hands on the students? 
 Um, I think we should stick with the issue here. 
 Ms. Bates, what we've observed and what we're concerned about is your son's emotional instability. 
 Instability? 
 He is emotionally unusual for a boy his age. 
 He doesn't interact much with others. 
 He keeps to himself a lot. 
 And based on the behavior that I have seen, Principal Hudgins and I would like him to speak with one of the school psychologists. 
 I don't know if I want him to be doing that. 
 And why is that? 
 Because I would rather that he... you know, I think that he should see a private psychologist. 
 You know, I would like to choose the therapist. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I think that therapy would be very beneficial for him. 
 Mm. Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 And, um, perhaps I could get the name of that therapist so that I could maybe explain to him what I've seen in school? 
 Okay, of course, absolutely. 
 I will keep in touch. Okay.

 23 years experience, and now here I am working for you. 
 You ever wonder why that might be?

 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 In fact, I don't think there's enough liquor in this entire bar to make you forget what a pathetic, self-destructive loser you are. 
 ♪ Yeah, who do you love? ♪ 
 Want me to kick your ass right now? 
 Oh, you're gonna kick my ass? 
 Really? That's the funniest joke you've ever had. 
 Uhh! 
 [Glass shatters] 
 You better watch out for me, golden boy. 
 I'll try to destroy you. 
 I used to be like you. 
 The boss loved me. 
 Gave me a chance to step up. Yeah. 
 What happened? 
 I don't have leadership potential. 
 What'd you do? 
 I'm not what you would call consistently reliable. 
 Now nobody respects me. Nobody. 
 You say you've been working for Gil for 23 years? 
 Yep. No, not Gil. 
 The big boss. 
 Who's that? 
 You'll know when you need to know. 
 Why do you stay? 
 What? 
 I mean, if you don't like it, then why do you stay? 
 If no one respects you, why don't you quit? 
 [Chuckles] Quit? 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. There's no quitting in this job. 
 No, you can't quit. No. 
 You could get fired, though. 
 You don't want that to happen to you, believe me. 
 Anyway, good night. 
 Mother... 
 I'm sorry...you know, about what happened at school. 
 [Inhales] What did happen? 
 Well, I-I got upset. 
 About what? 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 You know, I promise it won't happen again. 
 It can't happen because now they want you to go see a therapist. 
 I mean, this is all gonna go on your record, and you have to be more careful. 
 You have to try to fit in, Norman. 
 You can't go around being so emotional all the time. 
 I know, mother, and I'm sorry. 
 But I do think I fit in, for the most part. 
 Oh, can you give me a ride to Emma's shop? 
 Yeah, why? 
 I'm working with her dad. 
 He's teaching me how to do taxidermy. 
 Will, this is my mom. 
 I'm Norma Bates. 
 You can call me will. 
 Will, I'm wondering if we can have a word in private. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Norman, would you give us a minute, please? 
 Mm. 
 Please. 
 Thank you. 
 I don't know if this is such a good thing for Norman to be doing. 
 No? 
 Uh-uh. 
 He's already sort of... um, sort of an unusual boy. 
 You know, he has a hard time fitting in. 
 He gets upset very easily. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 He's always very calm when he's here working. 
 But hobbies can be good that way. 
 Oh, of course, and... 
 I just don't want him getting labeled as a freak or anything. 
 I don't think that learning taxidermy necessarily makes one a freak. 
 No! No, no. 
 I'm not saying that you're a freak. 
 No, that's not what I'm saying at all. 
 Not at all. 
 No? 
 I'm... [laughs] 
I'm not saying that. 
 Oh, no. 
 Um... 
 I'm--I'm just saying that not a lot of people do it. 
 Not many people write poetry, but we still have to have poets, right? 
 He's good at it, and he's good company. 
 We're not hurting anyone. The animals are already dead. 
 So what's the harm in letting a young person follow their passion? 
 What can go wrong with that? 
 [Strumming guitar] 
 Ugh. There he is. 
 Let's go. 
 You guys heading out to White Pine Bay? 
 What does it look like, douchebag? 
 You're an hour late, by the way. 
 Hey... 
 That guy right there, I remember him from last year. 
 He's a complete pain in the ass. 
 We should leave him behind. 
 Gil said we should bring all of them. 
 I think we should do that. 
 Whatever. 
 [Laughs] 
You're so good at this. 
 Have you done it your whole life? 
 Pretty much, yeah. 
 I stopped for about ten years, though, when I was married. 
 Yeah, Emma's mom didn't like it much. 
 She didn't like me very much either. 
 But I rediscovered myself after she left. 
 I'm sorry, Will. 
 It's okay. 
 I left that life behind in England. 
 And I got Emma. 
 And that's all that matters. 
 [Car engine starts]

 [Door creaks open]

 [Tires screech] 
 [Shrieks] 
 [Panting] 
 What are you doing here, Norma? 
 I could ask you the same thing. 
 I think you're following me. 
 I think you want to know what I'm up to. 
 And I think you know what I'm looking for. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Really? 
 Nothing at all? 
 Where is it? 
 Where is what? 
 Where'd you hide it? 
 Hide what? I don't have anything. 
 Really? 
 Then you weren't... screwing Zack Shelby either? 
 Excuse me. I have to go. 
 Do you think I'm just gonna walk away from this? 
 I'm not some moron like Keith Summers. 
 He was the bottom rung. I'm on the top. 
 You understand? 
 No, I don't. 
 I don't understand. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Well, my guess is, once you think about it, you'll remember. 
 When you do, come by my hotel room. 
 Mm. We'll talk about it. 
 Okay? 
 Tell me a little bit about losing your father, Norman. 
 He died in an accident in our garage. 
 Six months ago. It was devastating, of course. 
 But...we moved. 
 And we're doing our best to start over and reinvent our lives. 
 Yes. 
 Can you talk to me about how it felt to move from the home where you lived with your dad to a whole new town? 
 Yeah. 
 [Clears throat] 
Yeah, I guess it, uh, it felt... 
 I guess I felt a lot of things. 
 Like what, Norman? 
 It was sad. 
 He was sad. We were both sad. 
 Mm, sad.

 And it's past lunch. 
 It's time for you to pull over and buy us a meal. 
 We'll stop in a while. 
 Management here seems to think he can tell us when we're gonna eat. 
 We want to stop, man! 
 We want to stop. 
 Remo, pull over. 
 Get out. 
 Get out and what? You want me to watch you piss? 
 No, I want you to get out of the van right now. 
 You, your guitar, and anyone else who thinks this is a democracy, you can get out too! 
 We can stop for lunch whenever, man. 
 It's all good. 
 I said get out! 
 Let's go! 
 Walk over here. 
 Go on. 
 Thank you. 
 So same time next week, Norman? 
 Well, I'm gonna call and schedule something, but have a lot going on with the motel opening. 
 May I talk to you privately for a moment? 
 Mm, yeah. Yeah, I'll be right out, Norman. 
 Um... 
 I think it might be helpful if I saw Norman on his own next time. 
 No offense, but I don't feel comfortable with that. 
 I mean, I don't know you. 
 Have you ever been in therapy, Mrs. Bates? 
 No. 
 Would you consider coming for some sessions of your own? 
 Why? 
 Well, I've noticed you have a strong influence on Norman, maybe a need to control things. 
 I'm his mother. 
 Of course. 
 But as our children grow older, we need to let go a little. 
 Hmm? 
 The thing is, um... people who feel the need to control everything often, in actuality, feel out of control on the inside. 
 Do you ever feel that way? 
 No, I don't. 
 [Stammers] 
 I feel completely in control of everything in my life. 
 How dare you make these stupid assumptions about me. 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 I work hard. I take care of my son. 
 I know what's right and what's wrong for him. 
 No one pushes me around. I control my own life. 
 I'm in total control of my own life. 
 I have a lot going on. 
 I have a lot to deal with, but I do not feel powerless. 
 Ever! 
 [Sighs] We're going, Norman. 
 What happened, mother? 
 Did I say something wrong? 
 No, you were perfect. 
 Let's go. 
 Norman, go up to the house. I'll be right there. 
 Okay, mom. 
 Come on in. 
 I'd offer you a drink, but I can't seem to find a mini bar. 
 Here's your money back. 
 I want you out of my motel! 
 You didn't just do that, did you? 
 Look, I don't know who you are, and I don't care, but I don't want to have anything more to do with you. 
 Okay? 
 We are not having future business together. 
 You are not booking rooms here ever again. 
 You need to dial it down right now, Norma, before I get truly annoyed. 
 You want me to call the cops and tell them what you've been saying to me? Hmm? 
 How you wanted to rent rooms and have "privacy"? 
 How you knew Keith Summers and Zack Shelby? 
 I know all about you and Zack Shelby. 
 What? There's nothing to know. 
 I'm not afraid of you. 
 You have no power over me. 
 You were gonna try and convince me that you and Shelby were casual acquaintances, that you knew nothing about what was going on? 
 If you are not out of this room in five minutes, I am calling the police. 
 Okay, you want to play? 
 We'll play. 
 Five minutes! 
 [Door closes] 
 [Car drives off] 
 [Tires screech] 
 Hey. 
 Can we talk? 
 Mm, yeah. 
 The reason I told those girls about you and Bradley is because I heard them talking about you, saying things like it was embarrassing how you just stared at Bradley all the time and how someone like her would never have anything to do with someone like you. 
 Oh. 
 And it just made me so angry, because I think you are so special and so much better than any of them. 
 I just couldn't keep my mouth shut. 
 Anyway, I'm sorry. 
 I just didn't want you to think I had any other motive. 
 I know you think I like you. 
 And, okay, I guess I do, but... it's not about that. 
 I don't care if you're not gonna be my boyfriend. 
 I'm pretty used to things not turning out the way I expect and making the best of it. 
 It's just... you are really special to me. 
 And I feel safe with you. 
 You are my friend, and I don't want to mess that up or lose you. 
 I don't have many real friends. 
 It's okay, Emma. 
 I'm sorry I was mad. 
 I'm sorry. 
 If there was a door, I would have knocked. 
 It's fine, dad. 
[Chuckles] 
 [Car approaching] 
 How many rooms we got available? 
 All of them. 
12 rooms, 12 vacancies. 
 What happened to number nine? 
 You were right about that guy. So I got rid of him. 
 I handled it. 
 Cool. 
 Um... look, I got seven people here who need rooms. 
 They're gonna be doing some work for my boss, and we need somewhere to put 'em for the next two weeks. 
 Really? 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah. Well, I'll go open the office. 
 Thank you, Dylan. 
 Yeah, sure, Norma. 
 You know, Norman is staying for dinner at Emma's tonight. 
 Do you want to go get a bite in the village? 
 It would just be the two of us. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, sure. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I'm just gonna get out of these clothes. 
 I'll run upstairs, and then I'll come back down to meet you and settle everybody in. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 [Chuckles] Okay. 
 Oh! 
[Screams] 
 Oh, God! Norman! 
 Norman! 
 [Screams] 
 Norman! Norman!
