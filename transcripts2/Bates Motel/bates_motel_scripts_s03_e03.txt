 man : Previously on  Bates Motel...  
 How do you expect me to have a relationship with you under the circumstances. 
 Norman never has to know I'm here. 
 You're my son. 
 This is Annika. Room four. 
 woman : When is the last time you saw her? 
 Emma : Last night. She was going somewhere in town. 
 Norman drove with her to show her where it was. 
 Norma : Why did you lie to me? 
 You shouldn't have gotten in the car with her, Norman. 
 Why? 
 Because you can't keep getting into cars with questionable women. 
 You're being ridiculous. 
 I'm not! 
 I mean, look what happened with Blaire Watson. 
 Emma : Have you thought about looking in her room? 
 Maybe something in there would give us an idea of where she's gone. 
 Norma : What's The Arcanum Club? 
 Emma : It's a hunting club. Very exclusive. 
 What does any of this have to do with you, Norma? 
 There's a young woman. 
 She's a guest at my motel. 
 She's been missing for two nights. 
 When did you see her last? 
 Norman was the last person who saw her. 
 He drove into town with her... 
 [dog barks] 
 And I haven't seen her since. 
 [footsteps echoing] 
 [man speaking indistinctly] 
 Thanks for... for getting down here so fast. 
 Of course. 
 I'm sorry I have to ask you to do this. 
 They... uh... they found her floating in the tidal flats. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, I think it's her. 
 I recognize the toenail polish. 
 God, I think it's her. 
 It's not her. 
 You're sure? 
 I'm sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
 [pacing footsteps] 
 [vehicle approaches] 
 [engine turns off] 
 What happened? 
 I threw up on myself in the car. 
 Ever smell the inside of a morgue? 
 It's nauseating. 
 It wasn't her. 
 It wasn't? 
 Nope. 
 Did the girl look like her? 
 Sort of. Kind of hard to tell... 
 Are you sure it wasn't her? 
 For the love of God, yeah, I'm sure it wasn't her. 
 Well, did the sheriff say anything about where Annika is? 
 Why would he, Norman? 
 He doesn't know where the girl is. 
 He's been busy with the other dead girl. 
 You don't have to be so snippy, Mother. 
 Annika's still missing. It's not like it's nothing... 
 I don't want to talk about it, Norman, I'm sick and exhausted of thinking about it, and I have to start school today. 
 I haven't been in school for 20 years! 
 I'm probably going to look like everyone's mother! 
 So just please lay off of it. 
 I'm sorry. I jus... I just want to feel normal right now. 
 So it's not our problem. 
 Okay, it's sad and it's messed up but it's not our problem, so stay out of it. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 [electricity crackling] 
 Credits Excuse me. 
 I'm looking for Business Marketing 101. 
 It's in the main building. 
 Mai... 
 All business classes are in the main building. 
 Thank you. 
 [car alarm chirps] 
 [door opens, closes] 
 I... I'm sorry, that's actually where I usually sit. 
 Okay. Well, there's a stack of chairs right there. 
 You could just pull one into the circle. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. Could you, um... 
 Could you just move over a little bit? 
 [low chair screech] 
 All right, guys. 
 Welcome to Psych 101, History of Psychology. 
 I am sure that, like myself, none of you were drawn to learn about psychology because your own lives were anything less than perfect. 
 But in the meantime, I've got you and you've got me. 
 So let's try to make the best of it... 
 Are you leaving already? 
 I haven't even talked about Mesmer yet. 
 A hypnotherapist. He's mesmerizing. 
 I'm in the wrong class. 
 I'm supposed to be in marketing. 
 Are you sure you don't think psychology might be a good idea?

 [blows raspberry] 
 [whirring] 
 [heeled footsteps] 
 Still no word? 
 You look good, Emma. 
 Do I? 
 I just get bored wearing my usual clothes sometimes. 
 [vehicle approaches] 
 [car door shuts] 
 [car door opens] 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 [men speaking indistinctly] 
 Alex. This must be business because you rarely come here just to drink with me. 
 Like, I'm pretty sure never... 
 Wasn't our meeting a half an hour ago? 
 Was it? 
 I'm sorry. It's probably my office's fault. 
 [exhales] 
 [glasses clinking onto table] 
 If you're on a clock... 
 A dead girl was found floating in the tidal flats early this morning. 
 You need a better opening line. 
 And a better tie but I wasn't going to go there. 
 So about this girl? 
 Was she a girl-girl? Like a kid? 
 No. She was a woman-girl. 
 Early 20s. 
 Blonde. Lovely. 
 I was wondering if you were missing anyone from your little party. 
 Oh. I really wouldn't know. 
 There was a lotta "woman-girls" there. 
 You have fun? 
 I had a couple of drinks and talked to the people I needed to talk to. 
 No extracurriculars? 
 A little public for me. 
 I feel the heavy weight of your judgment, Alex. 
 Nah, Bob, I'm... I'm not here to pass judgment on your s*x parties. 
 I've got a great idea. 
 Let's play a little game of "What's Worse?" 
 s*x parties or letting the town erupt into a drug war, which leads to the DEA showing up and burning down the town's source of commerce? 
 I don't think you'd want to have a vote on that one. 
 Oh wait... We are having a vote. 
 The election for the next sheriff. 
 You're so far from being morally superior to me it's ridiculous. 
 If, ah... if you think I'm going to walk away from this crime because of what went down in this town these last few months... 
 That you're somehow entitled to a free pass... you're wrong. 
 Enjoy your drink. 
 It's on the house. 
 Two more days and we're gonna be able to frame the roof. 
 The truck's coming tomorrow. What are you using? 
 White pine. 
 Aw, that's sh1t wood. The rain up here? 
 You need something tougher. 
 Like... like cedar. 
 Gunner : Could use redwood. Be pricey though. 
 Yeah, Redwood's way more pricey, still not as good as cedar. 
 How much more pricey? 
 I'd say like an extra grand. Maybe 1,500. 
 I don't have that kind of money right now. 
 Call the lumber yard. Change the order. 
 Okay? I'll take care of it. 
 I can't let you do that. 
 Dude, he's practically offering you the money. 
 Stay out of it. 
 Hey, it's no big deal. 
 I still got cash from the sale of my mother's house, and I didn't do anything with it yet, so, look, let me spend it on this. 
 I don't want your money. 
 Look, I got the money. Take the money. 
 I don't want it. 
 Okay. No problem. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 [door opens] 
 Alex. I'm making dinner. 
 Come on in. 
 It's a... 
 [clears throat] 
 It's not really a... a social call. 
 What? 
 I need to talk to Norman about the girl in the morgue. 
 Why? He didn't know her. 
 In case there's any connection between her and Annika Johnson, Norman might know. 
 Now why would there be a connection? 
 What could Norman possibly know? 
 It's not like he and this Annika girl were friends. 
 You and I... We didn't just meet, Norma. 
 You said yourself, at that party, that Norman was the last person who saw Annika before she went missing... 
 I said that he drove her into town and then he drove back to the motel. 
 That was it. 
 What's the problem, Mother? 
 Sheriff. 
 There is a girl whose, ah... body we found in the marsh this morning. 
 Not Annika. 
 But she was around the same age, and I was just wondering if... if she might have some kind of connection to her. 
 Can I just ask you just a few questions, Norman? 
 Of course. 
 Come on in. 
 He really barely even spoke to Annika. 
 I thought you were making dinner? 
 This seems more important. 
 Oh, I can answer any questions the sheriff has. 
 Go make dinner. 
 Okay. 
 But if you need me, I'll be right here. 
 Yeah, I know where the kitchen is. 
 So, what do you wanna know? 
 Alex : Well, tell me about... uh, about Annika. 
 How much do you know? 
 [conversation continues indistinctly] 
 So when you spoke to her, did... uh... did Annika tell you that she was a prostitute? 
 Not explicitly. 
 No. But I... I got the impression she was. 
 I mean, she said she was working at a party. 
 I didn't think she was a magician. 
 But, yeah, I... I think she was trying to let me know that she was a prostitute. 
 Wh... wh... why do you think she, uh, she would have wanted you to know that? 
 I really don't know. 
 We... we were just talking. I.. 
 Well, I told her about how hard things had been for my mother. 
 Maybe because I opened up to her, she... she felt like opening up to me. 
 Maybe she's lonely. 
 God, yeah, I... I imagine that's a pretty lonely life. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, no, I... I imagine it is. 
 Women... women seem to trust you. 
 They do? 
 Well, I'm thinking of Blaire Watson. 
 Now she trusted you... 
 I like women. 
 Maybe from spending so many years so close to my mother... 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 So did, uh, did Annika seem anxious? 
 No more than most women, you know? 
 Have you met my mother? 
 Did she say she had any troubles? 
 No, uh... 
 No, she just said she was going to meet a friend. 
 She didn't say who. 
 And I drove with her to show her where the bar was. 
 And then she asked me to drive her car back 'cause she was planning on indulging on alcohol. 
 When you dropped her off, did you see the person she was meeting? 
 No. 
 I... I want to show you a picture and you tell me if you saw anyone outside the bar or arriving that looked like this at the time you dropped Annika off. 
 No, I've never seen that woman. 
 Have you interrogated all the weirdoes in this town? 
 Because I'm sure any one of them can tell you much more than what we know. 
 There's no "we" in this, Mother. 
 He's asking me questions. 
 No, I'm... I'm almost done. 
 Did Annika ever mention a place called The Arcanum Club, or a guy named Bob Paris? 
 No. 
 No. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 I wish, uh... I wish I... I wish we could've been of more help. 
 All right, well, if you remember anything else, if anything comes to mind about your interaction with Annika Johnson, you call me right away. 
 Of course, Sheriff. 
 We will. 
 Have a nice dinner. 
 How can you treat me like that way in front of someone? 
 I'm just looking out for you. 
 I know exactly what you're doing. 
 Stop it. 
 Oh really, Mister Smartypants? 
 What am I doing that you know so much about? 
 Why did you tell Sheriff Romero that I was the last person to see Annika before she went missing? 
 I didn't. 
 No, I heard you! 
 I don't know, Norman. It just came out. 
 But at a party? 
 It just hardly seems like party talk. 
 And why were you at a party? 
 Hmm? Maybe that would help us understand all this. 
 Was that possibly the night you were all dressed up and decided to go knock down the bypass sign? 
 Yes. 
 So why did you go to the party that night? 
 Maybe because I told you that Annika was here to work at a party and you wanted to look for her. 
 And that, for some reason, Romero was there and you got all agitated and felt like you had to tell him what you were worried about. 
 That's really the point of everything, isn't it? 
 What you're worried about... 
 Norman stop it. 
 No, no, maybe you should stop telling lies about me. 
 I wasn't the last person to see her. 
 I dropped her at that bar. She met a friend. 
 Okay, Norman. 
 I think one of us has a problem. 
 And I'm tired of the assumption being that it's me. 
 Hey. 
 Hello. 
 Is Dylan here? 
 No. He's not. Do you want to leave a message? 
 I've got his delivery. 
 I can sign for it. 
 It's not that kind of delivery. 
 Wow. That's a lot of... 
 Real magic hemp. Prime seedlings. 
 Ready for transplant. 
 Um, if I give you directions can you bring them up to Dylan's farm? 
 No can do. 
 The less I know the grow spots, the better. 
 You take the delivery or I take 'em back. 
 Either way is cool.

 [Dylan clears his throat] 
 Hi, Emma. Uh... 
 Hey. 
 Uh... What are you doing here? 
 Some burnout delivered your plants to the motel. 
 I didn't think Norma would want to find them on her motel porch. 
 Uh... no. 
 No, probably not. 
 [laughs] 
 Gunner : Hey! Emma! 
 Gunner? 
 You look great. 
 Thanks. Heh. 
 What's he doing here? 
 Uh, he needed a job. 
 You know him? 
 He stayed at the motel for a bit last summer. 
 Huh. 
 Well, it's a nice little piece of land you got here, Dylan. 
 Yeah. Yeah. Uh... It's pretty, isn't it? 
 It's very pretty. 
 And it's all yours. 
 Heh. 
 
 
 
 Caleb : Hey, Dylan! 
 Hi, I'm Emma. 
 Hey. How are you? 
 This is, uh... this is my uncle Caleb. 
 Norma's brother? 
 Yeah, that's me. 
 He's just, uh, he's in town for a few days, so he's... he's helping me build the barn. 
 Emma, uh, Emma works at the motel. 
 All right. 
 Uh, motor's shot. 
 So we're gonna need a new circular saw. 
 Okay, yeah, cool. I'll, uh... 
 I'll make a note of that. 
 Okay. I'm gonna work on the joists. 
 Dylan : Yeah. 
 Your uncle's staying here? 
 Yeah. 
 What's he like? 
 I don't know. I never really knew him before. 
 But, uh... He seems okay... 
 How long is he staying for? 
 I'm... I'm not sure. 
 Does your mom know? 
 No. 
 I just heard they don't get along. 
 Would you mind not mentioning to anyone that you saw him here? 
 Of course. I won't say anything to anybody. 
 Norma or Norman. 
 I promise. 
 Thanks, Emma. 
 Will you excuse me? Excuse me. 
 Pardon me. 
 Hi. I'm glad I saw you. 
 Don't tell me. I parked in your parking space. 
 Oh, I'm non-tenured. 
 I don't actually rate an assigned parking spot. 
 Okay, so what can I do for you? 
 Look, I just wanted to apologize. 
 For what? 
 For being a dick yesterday. 
 Look, I should've just told you I was the teacher. 
 I got pissed off because you wouldn't get out of my seat, and so I resorted to passive aggression, which was inappropriate, and I apologize. 
 I guess we're all dicks sometimes. 
 It's the first day. 
 My emotions got the best of me. 
 My ex-wife always used to say, "first days are the worst days." 
 Look, I... I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. 
 You didn't deserve that. 
 That's kind of you. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I am. [chuckles] 
 It's no big deal, but thank you for apologizing. 
 That's actually very nice of you. 
 UH, look, if you've been under a lot of stress, maybe I could help. 
 [laughter] 
 Uh... I'd... 
 I don't think you could help me. 
 Now that is what everybody says before they've tried therapy. 
 You're kind of pushy. 
 Guilty. 
 So, I... I... I've got this theory called "The Secret Club of the Damaged." 
 It's, um, people who have had crappy upbringings who can sense it in other people. 
 It's like an aura around them that we can sense immediately. 
 I... I... I don't know you from Adam, but I see a kindness and a sensitivity in your face, and also hurt. 
 I don't know if you've never tried therapy before, or if you've had a ton of it, but if it's the former, and if you've ever thought about just sitting down and talking to somebody about all the stuff you've been carrying around with you your whole life, maybe you'd want to give me a call. 
 [engine starts] 
 [car door opens]

 I've got a real name. Lindsey Davis, 22 
 Born in Omaha. Living in L.A. 
 She flew into Portland four days ago. 
 Travel records show she's been commuting into White Pine Bay one weekend a month for the past 11 months. 
 We found her profile on a high-end escort service. 
 How high-end? 
 Ten thousand a weekend. 
 Well, that cuts down the list. 
 Sheriff Romero? 
 Yeah? 
 I just flashed my credentials and your gal up front let me in. 
 You might want to tighten up on security. 
 I'm Marcus Young. 
 Running for Sheriff. 
 That's right. 
 I thought it'd be nice for us to meet. 
 Why would that be nice? 
 So we could talk. 
 Give us a minute. 
 I love this town. 
 Yeah? you moved here from where? 
 I was a lawman for 11 years in Stokely, Missouri... 
 Southern part of the state... Last four years as sheriff. 
 But I'm not new to White Pine Bay. 
 I've been up here fishing a bunch of times over the years. 
 My daddy's got lot of friends here. 
 So your daddy's friends thought it might be a good idea for you to come up here and run for election. 
 Yeah. I understand this isn't fun for you. 
 Being a sheriff? 
 It's like being a football coach. 
 You play out your string for as long as you can. 
 But eventually you're gonna have some losing seasons, and then it's time to move on. 
 Well, there's only one problem here, Marcus. 
 I'm not moving on. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 And you're not going to be the next sheriff. 
 Heh. 
 Well, I hope you catch some fish, and I hope you haven't sold your house in Missouri. 
 Condo. 
 Pardon me? 
 It's a condo. 
 I rented it out to my cousin, Carl. 
 Well, I... uh... I've got some work to do now, Marcus. 
 Um... I'm glad you could see the office, but... uh... this is the last time you're ever gonna be in here. 
 Why don't you show yourself out. 
 Fair enough. 
 Thanks for letting me swing by. 
 It was, ah, good to meet you. 
 The homicides... They're always tough. 
 If I can be of any assistance, just holler.

 What the hell is this? 
 Huh? 
 I told you I didn't want you buying me any lumber. 
 I didn't buy any lumber. 
 Then where did that come from? 
 I got no idea, man. 
 I just went down to the river to catch some fish, and when I got back... Presto change-o... 
 It was there. 
 Don't give me that sh1t. 
 Maybe Gunner bought it! 
 Gunner doesn't have a pot to piss in. 
 Yeah. 
 He's a good kid, but he smokes too much weed. 
 We probably shouldn't let him use the power tools. 
 Look, this is my farm. 
 I would've figured out some way to get the money for the lumber. 
 I know you would have. That has nothing to do with it. 
 I just wanted to give you something. 
 Just let it be. 
 Please. 
 Have a seat, bud. 
 Want a beer? 
 Mmm. 
 [playing guitar] 
 Okay, do you want to talk about it? 
 Talk about what? 
 I've known you for a while. I can tell when you're upset. 
 But if you don't want to talk about it, then I understand. 
 I don't think my mother trusts me. 
 Why do you feel that? 
 She's just always second guessing me. 
 You know, she made me manager, but she wants to micro-manage everything. 
 I ordered some new comforters for the rooms and she told me I was being extravagant. 
 What happened? Did you have a fight? 
 No, it's... No, it's not just that. 
 I can't put my finger on it. 
 It's just different lately. That's all. 
 I just feel outside of her, like she's annoyed at me all the time, like I can't do anything right. 
 Your mother can be a controlling person. 
 Sometimes she's a little demanding. 
 I mean, not to me, but I've... I've seen her treat you like that. 
 You have? 
 Sometimes, yeah. 
 She thinks there's something wrong with me. 
 That I'm bad. 
 I don't think she thinks you're bad. 
 I know you're not bad. 
 And you know you're not bad. So you're not bad, right? 
 I don't know, Emma. 
 If someone's always looking at you like you've done something wrong, talking to you like you've done something wrong, treating you like you've done something wrong, I mean, you start to believe that you've done something wrong! 
 Norman, you need to calm down. 
 That's easy for you to say, okay. 
 No one has been silently accusing you of something 24 hours a day! 
 It's enough to drive anyone out of their mind! 
 Enough to make you think that... that you did it! 
 Did what? 
 I can't explain it, Emma! 
 It's useless! I'm done talking! 
 [door opens] 
 Stop walking away from me! 
 Norman, stop. You need to calm down! 
 I can't stop it! 
 It's her! 
 Why are you glaring at me like that? 
 This isn't okay, okay? 
 You don't get to treat me like this. 
 What the hell have I done to you? 
 You want to know, Mother? 
 I was completely willing to take full responsibility for Miss Watson. 
 I tried to. 
 I wanted to. You wouldn't let me. 
 What does this have to do with anything? 
 Because I stayed in this world for you, Mother. 
 And now you're talking to other people about me behind my back! 
 You're treating me like I killed this girl! 
 Just make up your mind. 
 Norman, I don't think you killed anyone. 
 Don't lie to me! 
 [breathing raggedly] 
 Norman... 
 What game are we playing today, Mother? 
 [grunts, shouts] 
 I didn't kill Annika! 
 I drove her into town! 
 I know, Norman. I know. 
 I know. I know too, Mother. 
 I know too, because I remember everything about that night. 
 I've gone over and over it a thousand times in my head. 
 I didn't black out. I didn't do anything wrong. 
 I know. 
 I did not. 
 I know. 
 No. 
 Don't touch me! 
 Go away. Please get out of here! 
 [water running] 
 Did you kill her? 
 Mother, stop it. 
 I'm just trying to help you, kiddo. 
 I can't remember if I did. 
 It's all starting to blur in my head. 
 Remember when you were trapped in that box and you couldn't get out, and you thought you were going to die all alone buried in the ground? 
 You remembered everything in there, didn't you? 
 But you told me you killed Miss Watson. 
 I did. 
 I think you should get in the bath, honey. 
 I think you should get in the water and put your head under. 
 Hold your breath. 
 Recreate the feeling of being trapped in that box. 
 Maybe then you'll remember how you killed Annika. 
 [suspenseful music]

 Norman, breathe! 
 [coughs] 
 Breathe, honey! 
 Oh, please. Breathe, honey. 
 Sooo, you're all set to book a flight using rewards miles Breathe. from your airline credit card. 
 I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [coughs] 
 I'm sorry, Mother. 
 Just rest, honey. 
 I just need to run down and close the office. 
 I'll be back and I'll get you a cup of tea, okay? 
 What if I did kill her, Mother? 
 I'm going to be right back.

 Oh! Oh, God! Oh. 
 What... Oh, God! 
 You have to use this. 
 Oh, God. 
 Use it! 
 Do something with it. It's important. 
 Use it for you and your son. 
 What... 
 Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! 
 Oh. Annika? 
 Annika! 
 Okay. 
 [line dialing] 
 woman : 911. What is your emergency? 
 Someone's been shot. 
 I... I'm at the Bates Motel. Highway 88. 
 Please send someone. 
 I think she's dead.
