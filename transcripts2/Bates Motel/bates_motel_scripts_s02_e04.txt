 Previously on Bates Motel... 
 You're one of the most interesting people I've met in this town, and I cannot wait to introduce you around. 
 Does she try to set you up often? 
 Uh, no. 
 Never, actually, which says something about you. 
 Hey, I'm looking for Norma Bates. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm her brother. 
 My brother Caleb was here. 
 Just out of nowhere... he just showed up. 
 What did he want? 
 I've thought about this moment so many times, but now that I'm actually looking at you... 
 You have to leave. 
 Why is she so mad at you anyways? 
 Ah, you know how families are. 
 Things that happened years and years ago, it's like they're yesterday. 
 I never met this man before yesterday, never even knew that I had an uncle. 
 But already he's been nicer to me then you've ever been, told me more than you ever have. 
 He raped me, Dylan! 
 He didn't rape you! 
 You weren't there. You don't know. 
 You're a liar! 
 Get away from her. 
 Stop it. He can't help it. 
 It's his dad. 
 Caleb is his dad. 
 [Gasps] 
 No. 
 [Coughing] 
 Excuse me? 
 It's fine. This happens all the time. 
 It's fine. Don't worry about it. 
 Is there a manager around? 
 A man's passed out in that truck right over there, where anyone can see him. 
 Okay. Don't do that. 
 [Groans] 
 Dylan. 
 Dylan! 
 Um... 
 [Grunts] Oh, no. Okay. 
 Back in. 
 Norman. Norman. 
 Norman, wake up. 
 Emma. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's Dylan. He's in bad shape. 
 He slept in his truck and didn't wake up. 
 I think he was seriously drunk. 
 Do you want me to go get your mom? 
 No. No. No, she, uh... 
 She had a tough night. 
 I can help him. 
 Just let me get dressed. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Oh, no! No, no, no. 
 Sorry. 
 Get his boots off. I'll get some water. 
 He should drink water. 
 Do you think it's alcohol poisoning? 
 [Faucet running] I don't know. 
 I've never seen him like this. 
 Did something happen to him? 
 Did someone break up with him? Did he get fired? 
 Did he have a fight with some... 
 I don't know! 
 What happened? 
 Emma found him passed out in his truck. 
 I guess he's been drinking. 
 A lot. 
 You guys go back out and watch the office, please. 
 Maybe someone should probably stay with him. 
 Why are you here? 
 I work here. 
 But it's 7:00 in the morning. 
 Weekends have been so busy, and I just wanted to come in, you know, to help out. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 But is everything okay? 
 Yeah. Everything's fine. 
 Mother. 
 What? 
 Should we do something? 
 Like what, Norman? 
 I don't know. 
 There is one thing I can do. 
 What? Wait. Wait a minute. 
 Wait. Where are you going? 
 I'll come with you. 
 Norman, just stay here. Stay with your brother. 
 I mean it. This is mine to do, not yours. 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Sobs] 
 [Crackling electricity] 
 I'm asking for an extra half hour... 
 Checkout is at 11:00, Mr. Woodbury, and we do have someone coming in today, so... 
 I get that, I just don't understand what the big deal is. 
 [Door opens] 
 I'd even pay you a little bit extra if I have to. 
 You know what? Whenever's fine. 
 Just check out whenever. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 [Car engine turns over, car pulls away] 
 [Knock at door] 
 I thought you might be hungry. 
 And here's a clean shirt if you want it. 
 How long have you known? 
 Known what? 
 About all of this. 
 I didn't know until last night. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Really? 
 I find that hard to believe. 
 Why? 
 Because now I understand why I've always been on the outside of this family. 
 [Urinating] 
 It shakes a lot of things into place. 
 It must have been pretty funny to you two. 
 Dylan, I didn't know. 
 We never talked about it. 
 It was probably too painful for mother. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it was real hard for her. 
 [Water running] 
 Well, it's nothing, you know... 
 Just a piece of information. 
 You know, it doesn't change anything. 
 We're all still the same people we were yesterday. 
 What total bullshit. 
 What if you were given a piece of information about yourself... 
 Something that... something that totally changed the way you perceive yourself for the rest of your life? 
 I can't imagine anything like that, I guess. 
 Well, maybe you should... maybe you should talk to mother about that. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means what it means. 
 Maybe we don't all know who we are. 
 Maybe someone's been lying to you about an important event that happened in your life that you have no consciousness of. 
 Never mind. Go away. I don't want talk to you. 
 Dylan. 
 Go away. 
 Norman, what's going on? 
 I can't tell you, Emma. 
 I've been through a lot of stuff with you guys. 
 I've spent most of my days here for the last six months. 
 I've been through that whole stuff with your mom and the deputy and that poor girl. 
 I've been through stuff with you. 
 It's not like I'm an outsider. 
 It's a family matter, Emma. I can't tell you. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Hey, Dylan! 
 Hey, dude, I saw you up the street. 
 I was thinking about renting a boat today, going out to see if I can catch some salmon. 
 You want to come? 
 What's the matter? 
 We can't talk anymore. 
 Why? What happened? 
 You had s*x with my mother. 
 When you were both teenagers, you made her have s*x with you. 
 She told you that? 
 Yeah. 
 It wasn't like that, okay? 
 It was a long time ago. 
 It wasn't exactly like that. 
 You saying my mom's a liar? 
 No. 
 No, I'm not saying that. 
 Did you know I was your son? 
 Is that why you came here... 
 To work me, to try and get me to give you money? 
 She married a guy in high school, okay? 
 She got knocked up. That's your dad. 
 Dylan. Dylan. 
 This is yours, all right? Take it. 
 I don't know what's going on, but I never should have come here. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 I don't want to speak to anyone. 
 Uh-huh. Yeah, one moment. 
 It's for you. It's Christine. 
 Christine? Hey. 
 You were the hit of the party. 
 My brother couldn't stop talking about you. 
 He tried to do your Grand Canyon imitation and almost fell into the pool. 
 Tell me you're free, because Peter called in a favor and got us a table at the Greene Tavern. 
 It's probably the best restaurant in Oregon... multiple courses, wine pairings, the whole thing. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm sorry, Christine. 
 I... I would love to, but I just can't today. 
 I'm... I'm not feeling very good. 
 But another time, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 You know you could have told me, right? 
 I mean, I get why you didn't tell Dylan, but you could have told me. 
 You can always tell me anything. 
 Is there anything else you haven't told me? 
 No. You know everything now. 
 I went over to that motel to make him leave, to tell him I remember what he did to me, to face him and tell him that I'm not scared of him anymore. 
 But I couldn't, Norman. I couldn't. 
 You don't need to. 
 You don't need to, okay? 
 You don't ever have to see him again. 
 I wanted to. I wanted to so much, and I couldn't. 
 And he's still here in our town, in this place where we live. 
 And I might see him at the market or the gas station or God knows where. 
 I'm just so scared. 
 [Murmurs] 
 Just don't worry, okay? 
 Please try not to worry. 
 He just came here to take our money from me. 
 He took Dylan's. 
 Then he'll leave, okay? 
 He has no reason to stay. He'll leave. 
 Please try not to worry, okay? 
 I'll take good care of you. I promise. 
 [Knock at door] 
 I know you said you couldn't come earlier, but I know something about you, Norma Bates. 
 I know you're afraid to put yourself out there. 
 I am? 
 Yeah. 
 But I'm not gonna take no for an answer. 
 Come on, let's go look in your closet and find something amazing for you to wear. 
 You will look stunning in this. 
 I mean, you're gorgeous anyway, and I think I have shoes that will look fantastic with it. 
 Ooh, never mind. These are perfect. Perfect. 
 Christine, I really don't feel well. 
 I... 
 Norma Bates, stop resisting. 
 You are a beautiful, young woman living alone with your teenage son. 
 But he's not gonna be here forever, you know. 
 People aren't meant to live alone. 
 So you need to get back out there. 
 [Groans softly] I don't know how to. 
 So many bad things have happened. 
 There's only one way... one step at a time. 
 So George is gonna pick you up at 7:00, and I'm gonna meet you at the restaurant, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Oh, yo, Massett. 
 I need you to drive down to Essex, see this guy named Charlie. 
 He's got a load of guns and ammo ready for us to pick up. 
 Hurry up. Go. Move your ass.

 Are you going out? 
 Christine invited me. I couldn't get out of it... some get-together with her and her brother. 
 I'd rather shoot myself. 
 No, it'll be good for you to get out, forget about all this for a few hours, huh? 
 [Door closes] 
 Dylan, we should talk. 
 [Sighs] 
 About what, Norma? 
 [Sighs] Don't make this harder on me than it already is. 
 [Scoffs] Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. 
 I'm such a dick for making this hard on you. 
 Dylan. 
 What do you both want from me? 
 You think that I just have a magic wand that will make this go away? 
 There are things in life that have consequences, Norma. 
 You're looking at one. I'm a consequence. 
 No, you're not. You're not a consequence. 
 You need to be strong. You need to put this behind you. 
 I can't put this behind me. 
 It's me. How can I put me behind me? 
 He's... he's just a... he's a bad person. 
 He... he just came here to try to get money from you. 
 Is that right? 
 I ran into him today. 
 I told him what you told me about him being my dad. 
 And then he handed me this back... all the money that I gave him. 
 So I guess he wasn't just here to get money from me. 
 You saw him? What else did he say? 
 You know what? Just forget that I mentioned it. 
 Dylan. D... 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Stay here, okay? I'll get it. 
 Hi. 
 You must be Norman. I'm George. 
 Oh, yeah. Hello, there. 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. 
 Is your mom ready? 
 George, hi. 
 Wow. Hi. 
 You look fantastic. 
 I was just meeting Norman. 
 Shall we? 
 Okay. Bye, honey. I'll see you later. 
 What time do you think you'll be back? 
 I'm not sure really. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'll make sure she doesn't get into trouble. 
 Bye, Norman. 
 [Footsteps departing] 
 
 
 
 [Banging] 
 Dude. Go easy. 
 Sorry. Yeah. 
 I guess it's done. 
 Are you still bumming about that Bradley chick, or is this 'cause we thought you were gay? 
 No, it's actually... it's about my mom. 
 Yeah, well, parents suck, and if you only have one, they find a way to suck enough for two. 
 No, my mother's not like that. 
 She's not like anyone else. 
 Why? What makes her such a special case? 
 'Cause she'd do anything for me. 
 Have you ever had anyone that would do anything for you? 
 Anyway, you know, she... she just tries so hard, and this... this thing happened, and... 
 And I'm just worried about her. 
 What happened? 
 Tell me. 
 She's got this, uh... this brother who showed up out of nowhere. 
 And she doesn't want him here, and he won't leave. 
 It's just a big deal 'cause... 
'cause he's a bad guy. 
 Bad like how? 
 Uh, bad like, um... 
 Bad. 
 He was abusive when they were kids. 
 I just don't like him being here, being near her. 
 Damn. You actually love your mom, don't you? 
 Why don't you just beat this guy and get rid of him? 
 I can't. 
 I never... I could never do anything like that. 
 Sure you can. 
 I can totally walk you through it. 
 We'll scare the crap out of him, and then he won't bother your mom anymore. 
 Cupcake girl. 
 Yes. 
 Sorry to bother you. 
 You're not bothering me. 
 Well, good. Okay. 
 I just wanted to ask you something. 
 It's a simple "yes or no" question. 
 Okay. Go for it. 
 Did I... did we... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Last night. Um... 
 No. No, you just got wasted. 
 I didn't really know where to bring you. 
 Not that I didn't want to sleep with you. 
 It's just I prefer it when the girl's conscious, you know. 
 Besides, if we, uh... if we did sleep together, you'd remember. 
 I'm just so relieved that we didn't. 
 You have... you have no idea how... how relieved I am. 
 Relieved? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I better get back to the desk and... and let you get back to whatever you were doing. 
 I'm guessing you've checked in here. 
 You don't remember? 
 You actually checked me in last night before you said you were going to vomit. 
 It was kind of funny till you actually did. 
 Okay. I'm sorry about that. 
 I'll be around for a couple weeks, though. 
 I'm selling pot for the summer. 
 Okay. 
 Have fun with that. 
 Thank you for... for looking after me. 
 No worries. 
 So she says, "I absolutely did not buy a single thing." 
 Meanwhile, the customs guy is staring at the tag hanging off the back of her jacket. 
 [Chuckles] Speaking of shop I can't wait for that new Costco to open. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Peter's obsessed with Costco. 
 It appeals to his hunter/gatherer instincts. 
 They're putting in a Costco? 
 Yeah. Out by the new bypass road. 
 Well, I wish that wasn't happening. 
 It's gonna wreck my little business. 
 It's just gonna totally cut us off. 
 Oh, I'm sure tourists are still gonna want to come into town the old way. 
 Oh, come on, now. Don't lie to her. 
 You remember route 66, right, babe? 
 Shut up, Peter. Don't be a jerk. 
 I'm sure she doesn't want to hear about route 66 right now. 
 It's okay. It's not like I don't know they're building it. 
 Well, exactly, and hiding your head in the sand isn't gonna make it go away, right? 
 The new bypass road is coming, and so are the big-box stores. 
 Shut up, Peter. You're an idiot. 
 Oh, you can't blame a man for being excited about buying in bulk. 
 There you go. 
 Excuse me for a moment. I'll be right back. 
 Hey. 
 Oh. 
 Sorry about Peter. He seriously needs a filter. 
 Oh, I'm fine. 
 Are you sure? 
 'Cause if my motel was being threatened by a bypass and stupid people were making jokes about it, I don't think I'd feel too good. 
 Thank you. 
 Let's get through that crème brulee, and I'll drive you home. 
 Okay. 
 I've got a lot of experience in my family with crap like this. 
 You got to show someone you're serious. 
 My aunt's lame-ass ex was a real prick. 
 Wouldn't pay alimony. 
 My grandma hit him with a baseball bat. 
 Guess what. He paid up. 
 So what exactly are we gonna do? 
 Where is this damn thing? 
 [Tires screech, horn honks] 
 You're supposed to keep two hands on the wheel at all times. 
 Got it. 
 What's this? 
 It's your superpower... a tire iron. 
 Norman, can I tell you something that I've never told anyone? 
 My brother used to make me have s*x with him. 
 I was, like, 13. 
 And it went on until he moved out. 
 I couldn't tell anyone. 
 [Whimpers and shouts] 
 Room 16. 
 Let's do this. 
 You okay? 
 I don't think I can do this. 
 Yes, you can do it. We're just gonna scare him. 
 No, no, I can't go in there. I need to leave. 
 Norman, come on. 
 No, I have to leave. 
 Take me away from here. 
 Okay, Norman, calm down. We can go, okay? 
 Hey. 
 Oh, my God. Hi. 
 Sorry. Can I ask you something? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 When you said you were relieved that we didn't hook up, what did you mean by that? 
 I mean, maybe that's to say you're not interested, but I don't get that from you. 
 Maybe I'm talking stupid, but I thought I'd ask. 
 It seemed like the easiest way to do it. 
 I do want to have s*x with you. 
 Okay. What are you doing tonight? 
 [Laughs] Oh, my God. 
 I'm kidding. That was just a joke. 
 I was just relieved because it would have been my first time. 
 Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I, um... I didn't realize. 
 You didn't? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, just think how much pressure people put on their first time, knowing that they're going to have, like, a million more. 
 Mine could be my only time, so I just... 
 I just wanted to make it count... 
 Or at least be something I can actually remember. 
 [Chuckles] You're right. 
 You deserve that. 
 See you tomorrow? 
 I'll be here. 
 Me too. 
 At least the food was good. 
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone. 
 I wasn't up for it. 
 Christine just really wanted me to go. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, that's Christine for you. 
 Mm. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 You should have tried growing up with her. 
 Mm. 
 She was a force of nature. 
 I know. She got me to go. 
 She's been nothing but nice to me. 
 She's kind of taken with you. 
 Thank you so much for dinner. 
 Of course. 
 I'd really like to take you out again sometime. 
 I promise we'll leave Peter at home. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Thank you. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Zane Morgan, right? 
 Yeah. So what do you want? 
 I thought it was time for us to meet. 
 I'm Alex Romero. 
 Oh, yeah. You're that guy with the God complex. 
 [Laughter] 
 Come here. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Slurps] 
 You... you've been away a long time, Zane, and I think you might have forgotten how things work around here. 
 Well, things didn't work out so well for Gil, so I figured maybe there were better ways of doing things. 
 No. No, there are not. 
 What the hell are you looking at? 
 Well, a guy like you, Zane, I could just see making some big mistakes, just taking things a little personally and feeling like he had to prove himself, you know, by yelling the loudest and doing the most damage, taking the most scalps... 
 Make sure people took him seriously 'cause nobody does. 
 Hey, you want a beer? 
 Okay. All right. 
 I'm gonna take that as confirmation that you actually heard me, all right, Zane? 
 'Cause, make no mistake... it's a warning. 
 I can be a real nice guy till I break you. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm moving, Norma. 
 Why? 
 [Faucet running] 
 Only you would ask that. 
 Why do you have to move? I don't get it. 
 What is that gonna prove, hmm? 
 You made this mess. 
 Live with it. I'm not going to. 
 I made this mess? That's funny. 
 I thought I got raped. 
 Yeah, well, that's not what he said. 
 What the hell did he say? 
 He said that it wasn't like that, whatever that means. 
 He said that he wasn't my father, that you got pregnant in. 
 It's because he doesn't know. 
 I never told him. I never told anyone. 
 Why did you have me, Norma? 
 Why? 
 Yeah. That's what I thought. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 Yes, I'm fine. 
 I just changed my mind about wanting to do that. 
 That's all. 
 Okay. 
 What does that mean? 
 Leave me alone, Norma. 
 Stop it. Move! 
 What does that mean? 
 You used me to get out of your house. 
 You got knocked up by your brother, and rather than having an abortion, you used me to get your boyfriend to marry you. 
 You made him... you made him think that I was his. 
 You brought me into this world, using me... knowing what I was, not caring, just thinking about yourself. 
 Dylan, it wasn't like that. 
 You have to believe me. 
 I was so scared. You have no idea. 
 I had no one to protect me. 
 I was a little girl. I was a kid. 
 My father scared the crap out of me. 
 My mother was sedated all the time. 
 My brother would not leave me alone. 
 I had to get away. 
 I had no voice to tell him not to do it. 
 I had no power to stop him. 
 I wanted to stop him. God knows I wanted to stop him. 
 I wanted to tell him to leave me alone. 
 [Crying] I wanted to tell him. 
 I wanted to tell him to leave me alone. 
 None of this is your fault. 
 It's not your fault, but it's not my fault either. 
 I was a child. I was way younger than your brother is now. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Move away from the door. 
 No. No. 
 Move away from the damn door! 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Car engine turns over] 
 [Knock at door] 
 What do you want? 
 We need to talk. 
 About what? Who are you? 
 I'm Norman Bates. 
 Jeez, look, I got nothing to say to any of you. 
 Leave me alone. 
 Listen, you need to leave now, or you're not gonna like what happens. 
 No, I said we're gonna talk! I've been silenced long enough! 
 Look, I don't know what you're talking about, man. 
 I came here to tell you that I remember what you did to me and to face you and tell you I'm not scared of you anymore. 
 And all those nights you came in my room, I was too young to know the difference. 
 I was too young. 
 I just needed someone to care about me, and all you did was use me, you son of a bitch. 
 I never did anything to you, all right? 
 Don't lie again. 
 Listen, you're crazy, all right? 
 Stay the hell away from me. 
 You raped me... 
 Over and over. 
 I was your little sister. I loved you. 
 You should have protected me because I had no one to protect me. 
 It's all right. Just calm down, all right? 
 What... what exactly happened? When did it start? 
 Roger that. Sheriff, sheriff! 
 Hold on a second. Yeah? 
 You got to get out to your house right away. 
 What is it? 
 Just... just go. 
 I'll take care of this. 
 Okay, okay. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 [Door opens, bells jingle] 
 I'm Cody Brennen. Someone called. 
 He's been sitting like that for the last half hour... 
 No I.D., no phone. 
 Good thing he had your number on his arm. 
 You call the cops? 
 Not yet. 
 Norman. 
 Can you hear me? 
 I need you to get up. You got to come with me. 
 That's it... one foot in front of the other. 
 We're going to the car. 
 What happened to you, Norman? 
 Everything will be okay.
