 My name is Daniel Garcia.   
 My life used to be pretty normal.   
 I worked at my family's bakery in Little Havana with my mom, my dad,   
 my crazy brother, and my little sister.   
 I had a girlfriend. Life was good.   
 Until she decided to propose.   
 Will you marry me?   
 And I decided to say...   
 No.    
 That's when everything changed.   
 I met Noa Hamilton,   
 as in international superstar, fashion icon,   
 one of the most famous women in the world...   
 that Noa Hamilton!   
 What do you wanna do?    
 More than anything in the whole world?    
 - Change my shirt. 
[LAUGHS]    
 - Okay. 
That was your first wish.   
 The rest of the night was crazy.   
 It was fun, sexy, romantic.   
 At least until her manager told me   
 she picked up people like me all the time.   
 It's my hope that you leave now before you get humiliated.    
 So I left.   
 I went back to my normal life   
 figuring I'd never see her again.   
 You can imagine how surprised I was the very next morning   
 when she showed up.   
 I still owe you a wish.    
 No, I was just surprised.    
 I mean, you tracked me down, showed up unannounced.    
 Tracked you down?    
 You make me sound like a stalker.    
 It is kind of a red flag.    
 [LAUGHS]    
 Well, maybe I just wanted some more pastelitos.    
 Did you ever consider that?    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 So why are you here with me?    
 I mean, I talked to Lewis last night.    
 - He told me it was... 
- That's why I'm here.    
 I wanna apologize for Lewis.    
 [SOFT MUSIC]   
 What he said is true.    
 Sometimes I like to go out and meet people and bring them along, but it's never planned and...    
 Look... you took a horrible night and turned it into something I'll never forget, so it's all good.    
 ♪   
 But it's not all good because I didn't want last night to end the way it did.    
 I wanted you to stay.    
 ♪   
 Was that really a typical night for you?    
 Rappelling down a building?    
 Well, the baking was a little extreme.    
 I could tell, because you were not that good.    
 [GASPS]    
 You said I was above average.    
 You had a handful of flour at the time.    
 And pretty soon, I might have a handful of sand, so...    
 Oh, so then I should really go then, right?    
 - [LAUGHING] 
Maybe.    
 [SQUEALS]    
 - Whoa! 
Whoa!    
 Hey, are you Noa Hamilton?    
 Yeah.    
 Yeah, I am, but my friends call me Noa.    
 That's so sick!    
 Hey, Mom! Noa Hamilton's on the beach!    
 Does that happen a lot?    
 Yeah, but he was so cute.    
 So it's my birthday this Saturday, and Lewis always throws me this big party, and I never know anyone there.    
 It would be nice to have a friendly face if you wanna come.

 Yeah.

 First of all, she's not a movie star, okay?    
 She's a member of the billion dollar babe club.    
 Yeah, but she's not really like that.    
 I think there's a connection, but I don't know, maybe she has that effect on everybody.

 If I had known that any of that would happen, I...     
 - What? 
You would've said yes?

 But you kissed her.     
 I didn't do anything.     
 Look, she was at the restaurant and saw what happened.
