 Previously on  "The Baker and the Beauty"...   
 Ay, Abuela and I, we had such a fun time planning my quinces.   
 Turned out to be one of the best days of my life.   
 - But you're nothing special. 
Your work is derivative.   
 - It's over. 
- Put these back on.   
 [UPBEAT MUSIC]   
 Lewis!   
 Because as of now, you're gonna let me take care of you.   
 The surgery went well.   
 I'm confident we got the entire tumor.    
 You were sick and I didn't even notice.    
 Since we've been together,    
 your family's fighting,   
 the bakery's in trouble...   
 - Asbestos? 
- It has to be removed.    
 You got arrested, I almost lost my company.   
 I think we need to stop seeing each other, Daniel.    
 [DOWNBEAT NOTES]   
 Every culture has its own way   
 of making the transition from childhood to adulthood.   
 Confirmation, bat mitzvah, sweet   ,   
 and in our case, a quinceañera,   
 a girl who's   .   
 It's a rite of passage.   
 Aside from your wedding,   
 it's supposed to be the biggest day of your life,   
 and mine has been my mom's obsession   
 since the day I was born.   
 [DRAMATIC LATIN MUSIC]   
 [CROWD CHEERING]   
 A quince is all about spectacle.   
 The perfect dress, perfect hair.   
 It's a night for everyone to celebrate,   
 to cut loose, to forget their troubles.   
 ♪   
 But my quince has to do more than that.    
 My qince has to fix my family.    
 [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC]   
 My parents are on the edge   
 because the bakery's still closed.   
 Mateo's life has been complicated   
 since he kissed Vanessa.   
 And he hasn't smiled since he stopped making music.   
 ♪   
 And Daniel's making cookie pizzas at Duffigan's   
 to help make ends meet,   
 and to try to take his mind off Noa.   
 But how is he supposed to forget a woman   
 who is everywhere?   
 [SPOON WHACKS LOUDLY]    
 So your parents, Mateo's music, Daniel's love life,    
 how is one party supposed to fix all of that?    
 I don't know,    
 but my quinceañera is the only weapon I have.    
 I've gotta try.    
 Okay, so the million-dollar question is    
 pink and turquoise or purple and gold?    
 We need you to break the tie    
 and I promise we won't try to influence you either way.    
 - Okay, okay. 
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm?    
 [INHALES DEEPLY]    
 - I gotta say, I love the pink. 
- Yes!    
 - Pink? 
- I'm sorry!    
 - Oh, I knew I loved this girl. 
- [CHUCKLES]    
 [LAUGHS] Okay, so now we have to talk about music.    
 I was thinking we'd take a run at Mateo.    
 Ooh, mamita. I don't know if that's a good idea.    
 He's pretty serious about being done.    
 I've known him for    years.    
 I've got tons of dirt and I'm not above blackmail.    
 [LAUGHTER]    
 Mari.    
 Yeah.    
 Hi.    
 How'd it go with the inspector?    
 The good news is,    
 we got the all clear to reopen    
 as soon as the renovation's done, so two weeks?    
 But there's bad news?    
 The price of the renovation has doubled    
 - because of the extra work. 
- [SCOFFS]    
 What are we gonna do?    
 [SIGHS] I'm sorry, Natalie.    
 Your quinceañera's gonna have to wait.    
 What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.    
 This is practically a dieciséisañera.    
 Mari, do I look happy to you?    
 - We have no money. 
- We can put it on a credit card.    
 They're all maxed out.    
 Por favor, there has to be another way.    
 I'm sorry.    
 I've made the decision because it's the only decision to make.

- Mari.    
 Mari.

 We can't let this happen.    
 We need this quinceañera now more than ever.     
 My family needs it.     
 Maybe we could start a GoFundMe page.     
 We'd need a lot more than that... ooh.     
 Wh-what?

 Of course.     
 I told you, everything I brought you, I made myself.     
 Mm-huh.     
 Well, judging by my taste buds,     
 I would say that you've got every great chef in Miami     
 on standby.     
 Well, I love you and you deserve the best.     
 But Noa, really, giving me your bedroom?     
 What?     
 This is the best mattress in the house.     
 I appreciate the Florence Nightingale treatment,

 Lewis, you know I don't have time for that.     
 Oh, come on. You're not a robot.     
 I thought you didn't like him.     
 Well, you do.     
 Look what was happening to his life and to mine.     
 It was like the universe was giving us signs.

 Great, we can show up early     
 and scrape off the dried chewing gum.     
 Bro, we have to think positive.     
 We cannot let Natalie go without a quinceañera.     
 We have the venue,     
 let's call our cousins, tell them it's a potluck, and BYOB.     
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that sounds janky.     
 Maybe we could hang up some Christmas lights, like,     
 have a really nice vibe.     
 Yes, that sounds jankier.     
 - Mateo. 
- What?     
 But it's a plan, okay?     
 It might sound janky, but at least it's a plan.     
 Uh, I think I've got a better one.

 Hi, Daniel.     
 I can't believe you did this.     
 It's wrong on so many levels.     
 Daniel, who else do we know     
 who can snap her fingers and...     
 Voila, a kickass party?     
 Me and Mateo were already planning a party.     
 That would kick no ass.     
 I appreciate you coming, but we can't take your charity.     
 - It's not charity. 
It's me helping a friend.     
 Like you helped me in Puerto Rico.     
 We were together then. We're not now.     
 You broke it off, remember?     
 Come on, Natalie's had a really hard year.     
 New school, being outed by a dinner guest

 Mateo...     
 is that a good idea, like?     
 Why wouldn't it be?     
 MC Cubano is coming out of retirement for one night only     
 as a gift to Natalie.     
 So wouldn't it make sense for his former manager to be there?

 Vanessa, I've missed you     
 and you know my live sets are better than any other set.     
 Wait a minute, you're right.     
 Live MC Cubano is better than studio MC Cubano,

 I don't know, Vanessa.     
 Johnny Cash at San Quentin,     
 Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock,     
 Queen at Live Aid.

 Well, we don't know      
 because we decided not to entertain any offers      
 until we spoke to all of you first.      
 You'd really consider selling?      
 We're not sure,      
 but with you kids growing up and moving on with your lives,      
 this is an opportunity for your mother and me to ask ourselves,      
 is there something else we wanna do with our life?      
 We know it's a lot to take in.      
 Well, speaking of new opportunities,      
 Thomas Gold offered me a job      
 making videothe "Miami Journal.      
 - Wow! 
- What?      
 - Oh, my goodness 
- Good for you!      
 - That's amazing. 
- Congratulations, papi.      
 Wow!      
 And their website gets hundreds of thousands of hits      
 and I get to do what I've already been doing,      
 but with a real crew and a real paycheck.      
 So even though the idea of selling the bakery is crazy,      
 I...      
 With me taking this new job,      
 I feel like it's not my decision to make.      
 Okay. Mateo, what about you?      
 They better pay extra      
 for that state-of-the-art recording studio you made me.      
 How much did those egg crates cost you, you know?      
 Listen, you guys do not have to decide right now.      
 Well, I will.      
 The answer is no.      
 Absolutely not, okay?      
 - You're not selling. 
- Sweetie...      
 Newsflash, this isn't just a business.      
 This is our home. Where would we live?      
 - Wait a minute. 
We're just talking, okay?      
 - Yeah. 
- Are you sure?      
 Because it sounds like you're halfway to doing.      
 And by doing, I mean making the biggest mistake      
 of all of our lives.      
 ...was the same as what we're spending here.      
 - Mm-hmm. 
- We can't...      
 Unbelievable.      
 Oh, no.      
 We tell her to not repeat her patterns,      
 and she does this.      
 It's like she's literally throwing it in our faces.      
 Mr. Davis, of course.      
 Noa is expecting you. This way.      
 Hey.      
 Hi.      
 You look great.      
 Thank you.      
 Congratulations on the movie.      
 You made the introduction.      
 You look uncomfortable.      
 I didn't expect you to call after Puerto Rico...      
 Let's... Let's not revisit that.      
 Actually, can we?      
 I think it might be my last chance to apologize.      
 You'd asked me not to go,      
 and I went and I acted like an idiot,

 Is that Mateo's necklace?      
 What? No.      
 I mean, yeah. [LAUGHS]      
 He... he left it here.      
 You know, when he was doinghis whole MC Cubano thing.      
 But here, give it back to him.      
 Do you know the real estate developer Rick Jameson?      
 I tried Googling him      
 and all I could find was some random stuff      
 and then a weird Linkedln page.      
 There's a reason for that.      
 He likes to keep a low profile, right?      
 He wants to make you believe he's small-time      
 to hide the fact that he's very well connected      
 and has very deep pockets.      
 [SUSPICIOUS MUSIC]   
 Why?      
 He works for a billion-dollar real estate trust      
 called Cooper and Sons.      
 They pay guys like Jameson to act as intermediaries      
 to see if he can get them a better price.      
 Trying to make a good deal doesn't make them bad people.      
 No, but what they do      
 once they get your property does.      
 They go into neighborhoods, remove the local businesses,      
 and bring in national chains.      
 So not only would we be giving up our business,      
 our home,      
 our bakery would be replaced      
 by some soulless hipster coffee bar      
 that you could find in any mini-mall      
 in the country.      
 So Piper and Lewis tell me that I like to put walls up      
 when people get too close.      
 So it's true then.      
 I mean, Noa, when we first broke up,      
 I wasn't even sure that you noticed.      
 I just assumed that you weren't that into me.      
 And then we got back together, I...      
 I sorta realized that it's part of the price we pay      
 for being who we are.      
 I was just really hoping      
 that this time would be different.
