 My name is Daniel Garcia. 
   My life is pretty normal. 
   I worked at my family's bakery in Little Havana 
   with my mom, my dad, 
   my crazy brother, and my little sister. 
   I had a girlfriend. Life was good. 
   Until she decided to propose. 
    Will you marry me? 
   And I decided to say... 
     No. 
   That's when everything changed. 
     [CROWD GASPS] 
   I met Noa Hamilton. 
   As in international superstar, fashion icon, 
   one of the most famous women in the world... 
   that Noa Hamilton. 
   The last few weeks have been a whirlwind. 
     She's a celebrity. 
   She makes people fall in love with her for a living. 
   My sister may have found true love. 
     - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
  - [YELPS] 
     He doesn't look like much, but he's the real deal. 
   My ex became my brother's manager. 
     I get   % of every gig you book from now on    and don't you even try to negotiate with me. 
   And Noa's manager laid down the law 
     No touching, no kissing,     no anything that the press can interpret as romance.

   Maybe I should've listened to him.
