 Battle for Ringo Vinda. 
 Republic forces are locked in heated combat with the droid armada on a massive space station that encircles an entire planet. 
 Anakin Skywalker valiantly leads his men against the onslaught, which has lasted several rotations with neither side gaining any ground. 
 Aided by the twin sister Jedi Masters Tiplee and Tiplar, the Republic now mounts a desperate offensive to break the deadlock. 
 Push forward! 
 Stay to my left. 
 Fives! Watch out! 
 Thanks, brother. I owe you one. 
 You owe me a lot more than one. 
 Tighten our flank! 
 Shields up! 
 Yes, sir! 
 Don't get too comfortable. This battle hasn't been won yet. 
 Master Skywalker, we must get to the command post. 
 Admiral Trench has sent for reinforcements. 
 We must take this post before they arrive. 
 It's time for phase two. We're at this position. 
 Tiplar, you'll take your men down this passageway. 
 Tiplee, you'll move along here. 
 They'll have to divide their forces to counter us. 
 And when they do, Rex and I will press through the middle. 
 If we time it right, we'll all converge on this spot at the same time, and the droids won't know what hit them. 
 If we're making a run, we'll need backup. 
 My men are severely depleted. 
 Fives, you and Tup take ten of your best men and support Master Tiplar. We're on it, sir. 
 Hey, you all right? Yeah. 
 I... I just... Come on. This is a textbook battle. 
 We've run through this a million times before in training. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I just... I don't feel like myself. 
 What do you mean? 
 Follow me. Jedi. 
 Tup, what's the matter with you? 
 Uh, nothing. I'm fine. 
 Come on, brother. Don't want to be left behind. 
 Increase our defenses. We must hold them here. 
 Don't fall back! Push forward! 
 Tup, hey, this is not the time to freeze up. Pull it together. 
 We're almost to the finish line. Come on! 
 Jedi. 
 Good soldiers follow orders. 
 Hey, Tup! On your right! 
 Tup, no! 
 Sister! 
 Hold your position! 
 Destroyers! 
 We've lost our momentum. Fall back! 
 Fives, I don't know what's going on, but you are responsible for Tup now. 
 Get him back to base. I want answers. 
 The Jedi have withdrawn their forces. 
 Contact Count Dooku immediately. 
 I have something he'll be very interested in. 
 Count Dooku, the Republic forces are in full retreat. 
 But this is not why you have contacted me, is it? 
 No, Count. In truth, the Republic had pushed my droids to the breaking point when they suddenly turned and fell back. 
 It seemed that at the height of the conflict, a clone turned on his Jedi General and... executed her. 
 Intentionally? 
 I saw it with my own eyes. 
 I have studied clones and fought against them in many battles. 
 This action is unlike anything I have witnessed in their behavior as soldiers. 
 So there is a traitor in their midst. 
 It's rare, but such things have been reported in the past. 
 Not a traitor. This was different, it seemed. 
 Yes, Admiral? 
 It seemed as if the clone could not help himself, as if he was entranced. 
 Thank you, Admiral. I will take this under advisement. 
 Why? Why would he do this? 
 I'm about to find out. 
 How's he doing, Rex? 
 I'm not sure, General. It seems like he just snapped. 
 Tup, can you hear me? Yes, Captain. 
 What happened? What do you mean? 
 Do you have any idea what you've done? 
 Good soldiers follow orders. 
 Good soldiers follow orders.

 Good soldiers follow orders. 
 Good soldiers follow orders.

 What is he talking about? I have no idea.

 Good soldiers follow orders. 
 Kill the Jedi. 
 Ah! 
 We have to get him back to the medical bay before he hurts anyone else. 
 My lord, I have received a report that leads me to conclude we may have encountered a grave complication with one of our assets. 
 Assets? 
 Yes, sir. 
 A clone trooper has executed one of the Jedi generals. 
 And you believe this is indicative of our programming? 
 I do, my lord. But I cannot be certain. 
 It is pertinent we ascertain if this is an isolated event, a failure in this particular clone's programming. 
 Otherwise, my plans may be ruined. 
 Seize the clone immediately. 
 Yes, my master. 
 Fives, what's happening to me? 
 You don't remember? No. 
 You murdered General Tiplar. What? No. 
 That's not possible. 
 I would never... I could never... 
 Tup, you did. I don't... 
 I don't understand. How could this happen? 
 What's happening to me, Fives? 
 Ah! Ah! No! 
 No! 
 What do you think happened? 
 Did you check all of his scans? Well, all of his scans are clear. 
 As far as I can tell, this is a combat-related stress. 
 It seems he's had some sort of breakdown. 
 Kix, you should know better. 
 We were designed to withstand any stress. 
 I agree. We've been through a lot together. 
 He doesn't seem to remember what happened. 
 It's like he's sick or drugged. 
 Well, it could be a virus, a toxin. I can't be certain. 
 Let's talk outside. 
 You mean the enemy could've made him do this? 
 It's a possibility. There have been rumors that Separatists have been trying to develop an anti-clone virus... biological warfare. 
 Listen, we aren't equipped for this type of situation. 
 He'll have to be taken back to Kamino. 
 Only then will you have your answer. 
 Wait, wait! 
 Tup, it's gonna be fine, I promise. They'll fix you up real good. 
 We'll be having a drink together in no time, eh? 
 Good soldiers follow orders. 
 
 
 
 Good... soldiers... 
 You are a good soldier, Tup. It's time to go now. 
 Be careful. Yes, General. 
 We are tracking clean. 
 Calculating hyperspace jump in five, four... 
 Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. 
 Scanners indicate incoming craft. Abort jump! 
 Mayday! Mayday! The enemy has cut us off. 
 They must've circled around behind us. 
 We're being overwhelmed. 
 Can't let 'em in here. Hold that line. 
 Here they come! 
 Blast 'em! 
 General Skywalker, you're nearing the coordinates where we lost contact with the shuttle. 
 We can see it now. It doesn't look good. 
 Look like some buzz droids got on the hull and opened it right up. 
 Hmm. 
 Strategically, this attack doesn't make any sense. 
 Unless they were after something specific. 
 Tup! I'm going over there. 
 We're coming with you. 
 Over here. This is Tup's gurney. 
 The restraints have been cut. 
 The clankers took Tup? Why? 
 They must be responsible for whatever's happening to him. 
 It's possible. All I know is, they went to great lengths to capture him, and that means something. 
 We have got to get him back. 
 Don't worry. We'll find a way. 
 We have captured the clone, Count. 
 Good work, Admiral. Send him to me immediately. 
 And under all circumstances, keep him alive. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Get him on the next shuttle out of here. 
 But the Republic blockade... See to it personally, Commander. 
 It will be just three of us going in. 
 The shuttle will drop us off just short of the main hangar. 
 Then we space-walk from there. 
 Are you picking anything up on Tup's locator? 
 I've got a faint signal, but it's hard to track. 
 It's moving. Then we'd better hurry. 
 I've got a better signal. Tup is heading this way. 
 They're moving him to the hangar. 
 Are your scopes Jedi-issue, sir? Stay focused, Fives. 
 - There he is, sir. We'll have to work fast. 
 There must be a hundred droids in that hangar, not to mention the starfighters. This is stretching it even for you, sir. 
 Rex, you're beginning to sound like Obi-Wan. 
 You got a better idea? 
 Look, I don't doubt you could pull it off, but I'm just not sure Fives and I would be around to see it happen. 
 I've got an idea. Well, let's hear it. Quickly! 
 Grappling gun. Good thinking. 
 Get ready to hold on. That's why he's the ARC trooper. 
 Is there a problem? We were experiencing some drag, but the sensors are stabilized now. 
 You were experiencing drag in the vacuum of space? 
 Yeah, strange. But it is gone now. 
 Scrap 'em! 
 Hey, now we're experiencing turbul... 
 What's going on? What do you know about this clone? 
 I am programmed to resist intimidation. 
 Fine. 
 How's he doing? Not well. 
 Not well at all. I think he's dying, sir. 
 We have to get him to Kamino. 
 I'll want a full report from Kamino. 
 If Tup is the victim of some Separatist plot, we have no idea of how widespread it already is. 
 Permission to come with you, sir. He's my best friend. 
 You may need help. But everything must be done by the book. 
 Understood, sir. 
 You're to stay by his side at all times. 
 I don't want any more slipups. Yes, sir. 
 Good. Let's go. 
 Medical frigate 517, you are cleared for departure. 
 Good luck, boys.
