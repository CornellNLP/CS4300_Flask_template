 LUCAS: (v.o) Previously on One Tree Hill.  
 (Lucas is lying on the ground of the Rivercourt.)  
 FADE TO:  
 [INT. THE HALL – EVENING]  
 (Lucas stands at the large fake ID with his mother.)  
 LUCAS: Were you thinking about college?  
 KAREN: It can wait.  
 LUCAS: For what?!  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. TREE HILL HIGH SCHOOL – PARKING LOT – DAY]  
 (Brooke, Peyton, Tim, Haley, Nathan and Lucas are all in the school parking lot, talking.)  
 PEYTON: He’s in shock, now that you’re officially off the market.  
 BROOKE: It’s true ‘Dim’, Haley’s preggers.  
 HALEY: (Shocked) Brooke!  
 DISSOLVE TO:  
 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL – DAN’S ROOM – DAY]  
 (Dan is sitting up in his bed.)  
 DOCTOR: (o.s) The Phoenix Effect isn’t uncommon in cardiac patients. They grow…remorseful…introspective, sometimes even joyous.  
 (Dan smiles at Deb; she smiles back.)  
 DISSOLVE TO:  
 [INT. THE HALL – EVENING]  
 (Keith talking to Karen.)  
 KEITH: I’ve decided to run the dealership for Dan.  
 KAREN: You’ve given up a lot for Dan. He doesn’t deserve a brother like you.  
 KEITH: Actually, he deserves better.  
 (Karen looks politely confused.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. SCOTT RESIDENCE – LIVING ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Deb and Keith are lying under a blanket on the floor. Dan sees them.)  
 DEB: (v.o) We were two, lonely, people-  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. SCOTT RESIDENCE – KITCHEN – DAY]  
 (Keith and Deb are standing in the kitchen, discussing what happened between them.)  
 DEB: No one else needs to know.  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. ROE RESIDENCE – KITCHEN – DAY]  
 KAREN: (To Keith.) Hey, don’t be a stranger OK?  
 DISSOLVE TO:  
 [INT. THE HALL – EVENING]  
 (Haley and Nathan walk up into the hall amidst cheers and clapping.)  
 LUCAS: (v.o) You and Haley still married?  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. THE RIVERCOURT – DAY]  
 (Nathan kneeling in front of Lucas who is sitting on the ground.)  
 NATHAN: Yeah, she hasn’t thrown me out yet.  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. THE HALL – DAY]  
 (Brooke holds a Polaroid camera as she addresses Peyton and Lucas.)  
 BROOKE: I was thinking we could take the cameras, put them out, people can…(Shot of Karen standing and watching as Lucas pins up a picture of Peyton on the wedding wall.)…take pictures, put them on the wedding wall.  
 DISSOLVE TO:  
 [EXT. SCOTT RESIDENCE – DOORSTEP – DAY]  
 (Haley stands, holding a potted plant and looking at Deb who is verbally berating her.)  
 DEB: I will not give you my blessing for destroying my son’s life, or, and you can trust me on this; your own.  
 DISSOLVE TO:  
 [INT. THE HALL – EVENING]  
 (Lucas and Skills are standing to the side, conversing.)  
 SKILLS: I remember the person that you used to be. Why not just be him again?  
 (Camera pauses on Lucas’ face.)  
 DAN: (v.o) Could you ask Lucas to drop by?  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL – DAN’S ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Dan is sitting up in bed. Nathan is getting ready to leave.)  
 DAN: I’d really like to see your brother.  
 (Nathan nods reluctantly. He knows that he is now the outsider.)  
 FADE TO BLACK:  
 OPENING CREDITS ROLL:  
 FADE IN:  
 [INT. NATHAN AND HALEY’S APARTMENT - THE WEDDING WALL - DAY]  
 (We see the pictures that we saw at the end of the last episode. Ones of Peyton with a goofy face and Lucas and Karen together. Cut to a picture of Nathan’s head on cupid. Peyton is standing at one end of the wall while Haley stands at the other; Brooke is looking at it critically, directing where it should go.)  
 PEYTON: I think it needs to come down on the left some.  
 BROOKE: No, it’s gotta come down on the right.  
 HALEY: Our left is your right.  
 BROOKE: Oh…then why are we arguing?  
 (Camera pans and we see Tim sitting at the counter looking through the yellow pages.)  
 TIM: Hey Nathan! What do you think?  
 (Haley and Peyton straighten the Wedding Wall and place it up against a wall.)  
 TIM: Thai, Mexican, Chinese is always good.  
 BROOKE: (Nodding at the position of the Wedding Wall.) Yeah.  
 HALEY: Tim, you just ate! How is it possible that you’re still hungry?  
 TIM: I’m not ordering food, I’m ordering strippers.  
 BROOKE: (She, Peyton and Haley look at him.) Ooo.  
 TIM: What?! (Haley and Peyton lower the Wall onto the floor.) You guys got married so fast, I got screwed outta being the best man and I am not getting screwed outta the bachelor party. (Nathan appears with only a towel wrapped around his waist.)  
 HALEY: (o.s) Tim.  
 TIM: (To Nathan.) I-I was gonna be the best man right?  
 NATHAN: (To Haley.) He’s like a dog with a bone Hales.  
 HALEY: (Half serious.) Great, lets get him neutered.  
 TIM: Come on Haley! It’s just a stripper! It’s harmless fun.  
 BROOKE: (Pleased) You know, Tim’s right. See…(She yanks Nathan’s towel off, he dashes off to the bedroom, embarrassed.)…fun! (The girls laugh, Tim looks away.)  
 PEYTON: Yes, but so much more fun when you haven’t seen it before.  
 BROOKE: Nice! (Slaps hands with Peyton.)  
 PEYTON: (Realising his wife’s there.) Sorry.  
 HALEY: Yeah.  
 BROOKE: (Awkward for only a moment.) Haley, let the boys have their fun. (Dismisses Tim with a wiggle of her fingers.) Besides, what’s good for the goose is even better for you. They can have their little testosterone fest - autos and dial-a-date - but you get to have a bridal shower and rake in tonnes of loot from all the guests. This is so a fair trade.  
 HALEY: (Sarcastically) Wow, I so don’t need loot.  
 BROOKE: (Displays Haley’s hand towel.) OK, Sunny Hill Lodge?  
 HALEY: It’s Kichey.  
 (Brooke shrugs.)  
 PEYTON: So’s this thing. (Holds up a dusty pink, silk top.)  
 BROOKE: (o.s) Oh no. No, no, that is bridal shower code red. I’m on it.  
 (Haley snatches it away as Peyton laughs.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL – DAN’S ROOM – DAY]  
 (Lucas walks into Dan’s room. Dan is reading a newspaper and looks up as Lucas pushes the door open.)  
 DAN: I’m glad you came son.  
 LUCAS: You wanted to see me?  
 DAN: (o.s) Yes I did. I wanna do something I should’ve done a long time ago. (Lucas just looks.) I wanna apologise to you and to your mother. (pause) I’m sorry Lucas; for everything.  
 (Lucas stares some more; both confused and disbelieving.)  
 KAREN: (v.o) Hey, you OK?  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. ROE RESIDENCE – KITCHEN – DAY]  
 (Lucas is leaning on the back of his chair.)  
 LUCAS: Went to go see Dan. (Karen sighs wearily.) I’m not gonna hide from him you know.  
 KAREN: Yeah, I know. (pause) How’d it go?  
 LUCAS: He freaked me out.  
 KAREN: What did he say this time?  
 LUCAS: That he was sorry. (Karen is torn.) You know the scary part is that…it seemed like he meant it.  
 KAREN: Do you want me to go talk to him, maybe go see him with you?  
 LUCAS: No. No I’m OK. I’m just not gonna run from him anymore. Sometimes you just gotta let it go.  
 (Karen nods.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. NATHAN AND HALEY’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – DAY]  
 (Nathan is throwing balls into a wastepaper bin while Tim pressures him.)  
 NATHAN: (sighs) Man you coulda told me about the strippers instead of just ambushing Haley with it.  
 TIM: You knew about it.  
 NATHAN: I knew you were talking about it. I didn’t know you were gonna…order them in front of my wife.  
 TIM: Jeez! Did you get married or castrated? (Nathan shoots another ball.) Fine; you want me to cancel the stripper? Tell the boys it’s off?  
 NATHAN: (relenting) No.  
 TIM: See? You’re just as excited as I am. I know you man.  
 NATHAN: Whatever.  
 TIM: Whatever? (He intones.) You’re telling me this girl shows up all hot and willing; you wouldn’t go there?  
 NATHAN: Tim, I’m married.  
 TIM: (laughing) Right. You keep telling yourself that. But that ring, doesn’t erase your past Nate. Some of us still remember who you used to be.  
 (Nathan is uncertain as he dunks another ball.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. DAN SCOTT MOTORS – CAR PARK – DAY]  
 (Shot of new cars with two balloons each tied to the windshield.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. DAN SCOTT MOTORS – DAN’S OFFICE – DAY]  
 (Shot of Dan’s name on the desk. The camera pans up to show a smartly dressed Keith working around the desk; feeling out of place. He sees a life-size, cardboard, cut-out of Dan pointing up and mimics it with a silly face. Lucas appears in the doorway.)  
 LUCAS: Ha, looking sharp.  
 KEITH: Ah! Hey.  
 LUCAS: You settling in OK?  
 KEITH: Uh(!) Typical Dan, he um…did everything himself. Never let anyone help him with the big stuff.  
 LUCAS: Anything I can do to help?  
 KEITH: Yeah. You can come back and work for me like old times. What do you say?  
 LUCAS: Well I would say thank you but I don’t know. I…you know, it might be a little strange; getting a cheque with Dan’s name on it.  
 KEITH: No. Actually it feels pretty good. (Lucas laughs.) Well, the job’s yours if you want it.  
 LUCAS: Thanks Keith. You know, I’ll let you get back to work.  
 KEITH: Yeah, that’s exactly what I’ve been avoiding. I, uh, have to get Dan’s signature on these (picks up two white pages of paper.) and…despite me best efforts, I’m all out of excuses not to.  
 LUCAS: Are you guys still having problems?  
 KEITH: Um…actually no. I don’ know what drugs they’re pumping him full of but he’s kind of uh…(Can’t get his head around it.)…polite.  
 LUCAS: (o.s) Yeah, I know what you mean.  
 KEITH: (Laughing) I didn’t think that we’d ever be able to put aside our differences, like you and Nathan have, but um…well, who knows? (The phone rings.) Maybe they’ll keep him medicated. (Lucas laughs a little. Keith answers the phone.) This is Keith. Yeah. OooK, I’ll be right there. (He hangs up.) I um…gotta run.  
 LUCAS: (Pointing to the papers that need signing.) You know, if you want, ah, I can take those papers to the hospital.  
 KEITH: Are you sure?  
 LUCAS: (pause) Yeah. (Pats Keith and walk to the desk.) No problem.  
 KEITH: Alright. I’ll see you.  
 LUCAS: OK.  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. NATHAN AND HALEY’S APARTMENT – KITCHEN – DAY]  
 (Haley is attacking the counter tops with a bottle of spray and a rag; trying to get everything clean for the party, she is clearly nervous about Nathan straying after only a few days of marriage. Nathan walks in.)  
 NATHAN: Need some help?  
 HALEY: Nope. Just…straightening up for your…party.  
 NATHAN: Haley you don’t need to, it’s just the guys. They’ve seen it like this. In fact, they made it like this.  
 HALEY: (Laughs, a little bit too breezy.) Oh I don’t mind. Besides, if we’re going to have a skanky ho in the place at least it should look nice. (Nathan makes a slight noise.) I’m kidding…sort of…maybe.  
 NATHAN: Haley, this bachelor party I more for Tim than it is for me OK? He’s threatened by the fact that Lucas threw a suerception so this is just his way of proving that he’s still my best friend.  
 HALEY: Yeah, what’s next? Lap dances for world peace?  
 NATHAN: Look, I’m not getting all tweaked about your shower.  
 HALEY: It’s a bridal shower Nathan. It’s gonna be like the most boring thing ever!  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. KAREN’S CAFÉ – DAY]  
 BROOKE: your shower is gonna totally kill.  
 HALEY: Normally, killing’s not good.  
 BROOKE: No, no, but this time, it is. (Takes a picture of Haley with her digital camera.) Eyes forward.  
 HALEY: What’s that for?  
 BROOKE: Don’t worry about it. Just leave the shower to me OK? I’m gonna teach Haley James…Scott…whoever you are right now, how to have some serious fun. Tomorrow night, I’m tutor girl. (Walks off. Haley smiles sceptically.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. STREETS – DAY]  
 (Karen is walking down the sidewalk when she comes upon Keith getting out of his car.)  
 KAREN: (to Keith.) Hey.  
 KEITH: Oh, Hi Karen. (He is still uncomfortable around her.)  
 KAREN: You look fantastic. It’s a whole new you.  
 KEITH: Yep. Thanks.  
 KAREN: So uh, how are things going at the dealership?  
 KEITH: Go-good yeah, yeah. I think it, you know, it’s gonna be OK.  
 KAREN: Oh good. (Pause) (She looks at the coffee cup Keith is holding and sees that it isn’t from her café.)  
 KEITH: Oh you know what; I’d better be getting back. (Karen nods, hurt.) See you around, huh?  
 KAREN: OK.  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL – DAN’S ROOM – DAY]  
 (Lucas knocks on the door.)  
 DAN: Hey, good to see you Lucas.  
 LUCAS: (Walks in with a folder and pen.) Um…Keith needs some signatures from you. (He dumps them on his table and turns away.)  
 DAN: (Opens the folder and the pen.) You know, I was thinking. My doctor’s put me through some cardiovascular rehab; I thought you might like to join me.  
 LUCAS: (Smiles deridingly. Not looking at Dan.) So you wanna be workout buddies?  
 DAN: Give us a chance to spend some time together. Get to know you.  
 LUCAS: You had my whole life to do that.  
 DAN: Well life’s given me a second chance. Maybe you will too.  
 LUCAS: Do you think we’d even be having this conversation if you weren’t on the odds with Nathan?  
 DAN: That’s not it. But I understand your trepidation (pause) I know I haven’t exactly given you a lot of reasons to trust me in the past. (Lucas looks down.) Look, would you do me a favour and put a copy of this in the lockbox in my bottom desk drawer. There’s a key taped underneath the drawer.  
 LUCAS: (Standing and inhaling deeply.) Yeah. (Takes the folder and pen.)  
 DAN: Lucas? (Lucas turns back.) (pause) You might not trust me…but I trust you. (Lucas is really unsure of what to make of Dan’s new personality.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. DAN SCOTT MOTORS – DAN’S OFFICE – DAY]  
 (Lucas put the folder on the desk and takes the lockbox out. He opens it and puts the contents of the folder into it. A little pryingly, he goes through the lockbox and comes across the, now common, picture of Nathan as a child.)  
 (Smiling, he goes through a little more and comes across an envelope we saw at the end of last season. He pulls out the contents and finds newspaper clippings and pictures of himself as a baby and little boy. Karen must have sent them to him in the hopes that he would accept a little responsibility for the child he fathered. Lucas flips through them; feeling more confused than ever.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. ROE RESIDENCE – BEDROOM – DAY]  
 (Mouth is taped to a chair and wrapped in insulation tape while Fergie and Skills draw small targets all over him in red marker.)  
 MOUTH: (Sniffing) My nose is starting to itch.  
 (Haley walks into the room. Fergie uses a ball to rub Mouth’s nose.)  
 LUCAS: Alright.  
 HALEY: (Suppressing a laugh.) Ah h-hi, am I interrupting something?  
 MOUTH: Hi Haley.  
 HALEY: Hi. This is some…weird guy thing I’m never gonna understand right?  
 LUCAS: Pretty much.  
 HALEY: Great, well at least I came to the right place. Can I talk to you for a second?  
 LUCAS: Yeah.  
 SKILLS: (Stands up suddenly.) Yeah, we gotta go get eggs anyway. Let’s roll.  
 HALEY: Eggs?  
 (Skills and Fergie close the door behind them, leaving a prone Mouth in the middle of Haley and Lucas’ private conversation.)  
 LUCAS: So what’s up?  
 HALEY: Um ah (Looks at Mouth who tries to leave, or at least move, but he can’t.)  
 LUCAS: Oh. Um uh, yo Fergie!  
 (Fergie opens the door. Lucas points to Mouth.)  
 MOUTH: Sorry. Hey, how bout you guys roll me down the street and see if you can hit me on the fly. (Lucas aims his ball at Mouth and gets him in the stomach.) Ow.  
 HALEY: So you know bout this whole Bachelor party thing right?  
 LUCAS: Oh Haley(!) Look, it’s just goofy guy stuff OK?  
 HALEY: I know. I just wish he’d done his goofy guy stuff before we got married.  
 LUCAS: Well he would’ve, if you’da gotten married ten years from now. (Haley gives him a ‘don’t start’ look.) Joking! Sorry! (Holds his hands up.)  
 HALEY: (Having a hard time setting a spy on her husband.) Would you just (pause) look after him?  
 LUCAS: I’ll tell you what; I will sacrifice myself and go to the bachelor party to take care of Nathan.  
 HALEY: Oh, you’re so heroic. (Walks up to him and they slap hands.) Thank you.  
 SKILLS: Hey yo, check it out, we got these trash can set up like bowling pins right. So I figured we just gonna roll Mouth’s squirrelly little ass right on into em.  
 (Cue sound of crashing and Mouth laughing.)  
 HALEY: (Laughing) Oh-ho, I so got next.  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL – DAN’S ROOM – DAY]  
 DOCTOR: Medication will treat the symptoms but…the best treatment for you now is a radical lifestyle change. (Deb is standing next to Dan’s bed.) So we’re gonna put you on a physical therapy regiment and you can start that as soon as you’re released; the day after tomorrow.  
 DAN: So what are we talking about doc? Weights? Treadmill?  
 DOCTOR: More like, some stretching, short walks, you have to understand Dan, you’re looking at a long road back and the road is called the rest of your life. (leaves)  
 DEB: Uh, the hospital gave me the name of their best physical therapist and there’s also a nurse who can move in with you at the beach house-  
 DAN: I wanna come home Deb.  
 (Deb looks at him but it doesn’t look like she’s protesting this time.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. NATHAN AND HALEY’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – DAY]  
 (Tim sits on the couch, next to Nathan, holding two bottles.)  
 TIM: Dude, smell me.  
 NATHAN: Dude, kiss my ass.  
 TIM: No seriously. I wanna smell nice for the…talent that’s coming over later.  
 NATHAN: Tim, just say the stripper.  
 TIM: Fine, the stripper. Alright, which one makes me smell available? I’ve got ‘Flesh’ on this side and uh (Looks at his right hand.) this ‘Frink’ stuff on this side. (Shows his neck.)  
 NATHAN: (Points to the ‘Frink’ perfume.) That’s not mine.  
 TIM: Well it was in your bathroom.  
 HALEY: (Comes into the shot.) Oh Tim. What’re you doing with my perfume. (Takes it and walks away. Tim rubs at his neck with his shirt as Nathan laughs.)  
 HALEY: (Sprays the perfume of her wrist.) Alright. I’m off. All the important numbers are by the phone…police, fire, pimps.  
 NATHAN: Thanks for worrying about us.  
 HALEY: (Puts her arms around Nathan from behind the sofa.) I’m not worried about you. Have your fun, just remember (Kisses him.) You’re married now.  
 (Knock on the door.)  
 TIM: She’s here! (Jumps over the couch to get the door before Haley can.) (sings) Stripper time. (Opens the door to Lucas.) Oh it’s just you.  
 LUCAS: Not the thrill it used to be huh? (Smacks his shoulder and enters. Tim looks out to see if she’s coming.)  
 LUCAS: Hi  
 HALEY: Hi (They hug.) (To Nathan) OK, uh, I left some ones on the counter, in case you don’t have any change don’t spend it all in one (quietly) place.  
 LUCAS: (He and Nathan are on the sofa. Lucas looks over at a thoroughly depressed Tim picking at the money.) (To Nathan.) What’s wrong with ‘Dim’?  
 NATHAN: Oh don’t take it personally. (Also looks at Tim.) He thought you were the stripper.  
 LUCAS: Hey, we’d prefer to be called exotic dancers.  
 NATHAN: (nodding) Nice. (They laugh.)  
 (There’s a knock at the door and Tim rushes to get it. It’s Gary, the guy Nathan works with in ‘Hot and Twisted’.)  
 TIM: Who the hell are you?  
 GARY: (looking around) Where’s the stripper?  
 (Tim shuts the door annoyed.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. ROAD – EVENING]  
 (A large van like limo drives along on the road.)  
 HALEY: Haha! I can not believe you rented this for my shower;  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. LIMO – EVENING]  
 (Haley and Peyton are sitting on one side of the limo as Brooke leans on the drinks box.)  
 HALEY: Brooke this is crazy.  
 BROOKE: Hmm (Shrugs.)  
 PEYTON: And by crazy, she means thank you.  
 HALEY: Oh yeah god, Brooke, thank you. I’m I-I’m blown away by all this.  
 BROOKE: You’re welcome. (Opens the drink box lid.)  
 PEYTON: I think someone feels a little guilty about the whole pregnancy rumour.  
 HALEY: Oh. (Peyton nods.) Well, water under the bridge.  
 BROOKE: (Handing Peyton and Haley champagne glasses.) Forget the water, lets have champagne.  
 PEYTON: Yes.  
 HALEY: Champagne? How much is that gonna cost?  
 BROOKE: Who cares? It’s on my dad’s credit card.  
 HALEY: I dunno you guys. Last time I drank, I…threw up in Dan’s lap. (Bringing up the memory somewhat fondly. Peyton looks at her.)  
 BROOKE: Uh-huh.  
 (Haley pauses and then mumbles as she holds out her glass.)  
 PEYTON: That’s my girl.  
 HALEY: Alright, a toast to…a nice normal bridal shower.  
 PEYTON: To nice. (Holds up her glass.)  
 BROOKE: And normal. (Her tone suggesting anything but. All three clink glasses and drink.)  
 PEYTON: (Passes her glass over to Brooke after one sip and holds out a long, black piece of cloth.) Uh-hum.  
 HALEY: What’s that?  
 PEYTON: It’s just a, ah, nice and normal blindfold.  
 HALEY: For what?  
 BROOKE: For the nice, normal, guest of honour.  
 (Peyton and Brooke laugh as Peyton blindfolds Haley.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. NATHAN AND HALEY’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Gary and Tim are sitting on the couch, Nathan and Lucas are on the floor, playing a video game. No one is saying anything and they all look immensely bored.)  
 TIM: (To Nathan about Gary.) Sure you know this guy?  
 NATHAN: He works with me in ‘Hot and Twisted’.  
 GARY: (Sees Tim looking at him.) Great. Even losers don’t know me.  
 TIM: Just read the damn quiz.  
 GARY: (Reads from the magazine.) When your boyfriend kisses you (Lucas looks a mixture of confused, disgusted and amused.) he; A.  
 LUCAS: What the hell are you reading?  
 TIM: Cosmo Girl.  
 (Lucas still looks puzzled as Nathan shakes his head.)  
 GARY: When your boyfriend kisses you he; A, Looks deeply into your eyes. (Tim mimics what Gary is asking.) B, Closes his eyes. (Tim closes his eyes.) C, Cradles your head softly. (Even Nathan looks.) D, Unhooks your bra.  
 TIM: (Eyes still closed.) It’s D. It’s definitely D, you go for the bra.  
 NATHAN: Now Tim, you realise you’re supposed to be answering as a girl.  
 TIM: I know, and I’d want a boyfriend who isn’t afraid to go up my shirt.  
 LUCAS: And hopefully, someday, you’ll find him.  
 GARY: OK, this sucks. What kind of bachelor party is this? Hmm? No booze, no strippers. (Lucas points to Gary from behind.) I thought you guys throw, like, the best parties. This is…lame.  
 TIM: Dude, my brother’s settin up the stripper so we aint gonna be disappointed.  
 LUCAS: I just hope the stripper’s not a guy, I remember the last time you were on stripper duty.  
 TIM: Alright. I wasn’t gonna crack this out till later but what the hell. (Reaches over and picks up a tape.) Let’s set the mood with a little something from my dad’s porno stash. (Jumps off the sofa and walks over to the TV.) I was up late one night (Inserts the tape.) and I heard my dad watching this. (Sits back on the sofa.) The chick in it goes absolutely nuts.  
 GARY: Sweet!  
 (Brooding as Tim presses play. We hear a lot of moaning. Tim looks on open mouthed.)  
 NATHAN: Tim, is that your mom?  
 TIM: Step mom. (Moaning gets louder. Lucas’ gets more grossed out. Nathan looks away.)  
 GARY: (o.s) Dude, your mom’s a slut!  
 TIM: Hehe, step mom! (Holds up his hand for Gary to slap but he doesn’t. Moaning continues.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. LINGERIE SHOP – EVENING]  
 (Brooke, Peyton and a blindfolded Haley walk into a dark lingerie shop.)  
 PEYTON: Can you see?  
 HALEY: What is going on? (Brooke and Peyton laugh.)  
 (The light is turned on and Brooke takes the blindfold off. Haley just stares.)  
 HALEY: What is this?  
 BROOKE: This is a lingerie fashion show girlie. (Haley gasps.) We figured that since you’re married now, you need to wear something a little less conservative for Nathan. Something a little more…(Looks to Peyton for help.)  
 PEYTON: Slutty. (Haley cringes.)  
 BROOKE: That’s it. (Walks up to four changing cubicles.) Hit it girls!  
 (Out come four girls dressed in skimpier and skimpier lingerie.)  
 BROOKE: (o.s) Woah, sugar, spice. Look, that’s cute.  
 (Haley laughs off-screen.)  
 PEYTON: (o.s) Oh my. Go baby, go baby.  
 (The girls spin and show off the lingerie as Haley, Peyton and Brooke make various exclamations off-screen. Teresa comes out last in red lingerie with silk robe.)  
 BROOKE: Yeah, Teresa! I call that red hot! (Laughs.)  
 (The girls line up on either side of Peyton and Brooke while Haley continues to cringe.)  
 BROOKE: (Stands next to Haley.) OK.  
 HALEY: (Shocked) How’d you. (Gestures at the place.)  
 BROOKE: After all the money that I spend in this place, they owed me a few favours. (Peyton and Brooke take Haley by the arms and walk her off-screen.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. KARENS CAFÉ (EST SHOT) – EVENING]  
 (Keith walks into the café.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. KAREN’S CAFÉ – EVENING]  
 (Karen is at the coffee machine as the bell rings. She turns and sees Keith enter.)  
 KAREN: Hey.  
 KEITH: Hey.  
 KAREN: (Taking her apron off.) Want some coffee? It’s not the fancy competition but-  
 KEITH: I love your coffee Karen. You know that.  
 KAREN: So, it’s not the coffee you’re avoiding.  
 KEITH: I’m just (pause) having a hard time being around you right now.  
 KAREN: But, before the proposal we were friends Keith I mean can’t we at least try to go back to the way we were then?  
 KEITH: (Knows that it’s too hard for him.) I don’t think so. (Karen can’t understand why.) You know, sometimes it’s just…better to move on. You know, kinda like you did with Peyton’s dad.  
 KAREN: I haven’t seen Larry in ages. There’s nothing there. But even if there was, I mean, your idea of moving on; does it mean cutting me out of your life completely?  
 KEITH: I don’t want to, but I have to. (He exits the shop. Karen is upset.)  
 FADE OUT:  
 COMMERCIAL SET:  
 [INT. LINGERIE SHOP – EVENING]  
 (Peyton and Brooke put their heads close to the changing cubicle curtain.)  
 BROOKE: Haley. Are you coming out kitten?  
 HALEY: I am not coming out. (Peyton and Brooke have changed into some lingerie also.)  
 PEYTON: See, if you don’t come out, then we’re coming in.  
 (Brooke and Peyton pull back the curtain. Haley is standing there in lingerie and her hair up in two high pigtails. The girls cheer and laugh.)  
 ONE OF THE GIRLS: Sexy schoolgirl look.  
 HALEY: I don’t know.  
 PEYTON: Nathan Scott, is going to blow a fuse when he sees you in this.  
 HALEY: Guys, there is no way I can pull this off! (Turns away.)  
 BROOKE: (Grabbing hold of Haley.) No, actually, I’d leave that up to Nathan. (Girls laugh.) Specially after our next stop. (Haley looks at her. There is clearly more.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. OUTSIDE NATHAN’S APARTMENT – EVENING]  
 (Skills, Fergie and Mouth are walking with some other guys. Skills and Fergie are holding a beer keg between themselves as they walk.)  
 SKILLS: (to Mouth.) I still can’t believe you pulled off this keg dawg.  
 MOUTH: Well you can thank Brooke and the fake ID she made.  
 FERGIE: Tell the truth, you get with that or what?  
 MOUTH: A gentleman never tells.  
 SKILLS: Man, that’s just ‘Mouth’ for NO! (They walk up to Nathan’s apartment.)  
 (Cut to a police car with two female cops sitting there watching the take the keg up.)  
 OFFICIAL GRASSO: Are you seeing what I’m seeing? (I.e. the boy taking up the keg.)  
 OFFICIAL BERNSTEIN: What is wrong with youth of America today?  
 OFFICIAL GRASSO: Hm, time to protect and serve. (The get out of the car.)

 [INT. THE LIMO – EVENING]  
 (The girls are all in normal clothes now and dancing in the back of the limo.)  
 BROOKE: OK! Ok, ok, ok everybody. This is a very important moment in our little Haley’s life. (Haley stands.) The moment when she becomes a woman. (Pulls out a fake ID.) At least, according to the State of North Dakota! (o.s) It’s your very first fake ID.  
 HALEY: (Takes it and looks at the name.) Trudy Gill. Oh I get it, Trudy Gi- Tutor Girl.  
 (The limo suddenly pulls to a halt.)  
 BROOKE: Woah! Hey, why are we stopping?  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE – EVENING]  
 BROOKE: (Leaning on the limo.) What do you mean it’s gonna take at least an hour to send somebody out? Let me explain to you the law of supply and demand; if I supply the credit card, I get to demand that you get somebody out here to fix the car!  
 HALEY: Brooke. I really-I could just call Lucas.  
 BROOKE: (o.s) No!  
 PEYTON: I already tried, his phone’s off.  
 (Horn beeps. A mechanics truck pulls up. The mechanic gets out with his toolbox.)  
 HALEY: (relieved) Oh good! (Brooke smiles happily.)  
 MECHANIC: What seems to be the trouble?  
 HALEY: Um…it’s probably the engine.  
 MECHANIC: Oh, I see exactly what the trouble is.  
 HALEY: (slightly confused.) Great, can you fix it?  
 MECHANIC: Sure, I gotta tool that can fix anything. (Leans down and turns on a stereo. Brooke tries to hold back a laugh. He rips his pants off. Haley yells and Brooke and Peyton laugh. Haley covers her eyes. He begins to strip.)  
 HALEY: (Accusingly to Brooke.) I am gonna kill you.  
 BROOKE: Nice performance Cameron Diaz.  
 PEYTON: Hm, you too Gwyneth. (Haley closes her eyes.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – EVENING]  
 (There’s a knock on the door and Tim, once again, rushes to answer it. Mouth opens the door to the cops. Skills puts a towel over the keg and he and Lucas try to look innocent.)  
 TIM: (o.s) Oh sweet, they’re in costume. Did my brother deliver or what!  
 OFFICIAL BERNSTEIN: We witnessed a keg being brought up to this apartment. Are you boys of age?  
 OFFICIAL GRASSO: Let’s see some ID.  
 TIM: Let’s see some hot girl on girl! (Smacks Official Bernstein’s ass. The cops grab his arms and push him up against a window.) Damn these strippers a strong! (Official Grasso looks at Lucas who hold his hands up.) I can feel your breasts against my back!  
 OFFICIAL BERNSTEIN: Better yet! Forget the keg! Arrest the perv. (She handcuffs him.)  
 TIM: Ow! You’re hurting me! Does that cost extra?  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. THE LIMO – EVENING]  
 (The girls dance with the stripper. Haley, Peyton and Brooke are sitting down. Haley is still embarrassed.)  
 PEYTON: Hey. (She points up at the sunroof.) A moonroof.  
 (Haley sticks her body out of the roof. She laughs appearing to be on her way to ‘very drunk’. Two other girls also stick themselves out of the sunroof.)  
 HALEY: WooHoo!  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – DOORSTEP – EVENING]  
 (Official Bernstein writes something on her notepad.)  
 NATHAN: (Trying to console the situation.) Officer, there’s been a misunderstanding.  
 LUCAS: He thought you were a stripper.  
 TIM: (Sticking his head out of the window.) I can see your thong strap foxy brown! (Makes an animal like noise. Official Bernstein turns back to Nathan; all the guys are laughing.)  
 LUCAS: Never mind.  
 NATHAN: Yeah, take him.  
 (Official Bernstein pulls her baton out and twirls it, walking away. Lucas looks at Nathan who shakes his head.)  
 TIM: (out of the back car window.) I’ve never been so horny! (They drive away. The guys continue to laugh. Lucas holds his hand up as they depart.)  
 (The limo drives past with Haley still out of the sunroof. Only this time, the stripper is also there.)  
 MOUTH: Hey, its girls gone wild!  
 NATHAN: (squinting) Haley? (Haley mimes the song paying…badly.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. KAREN’S CAFÉ – EVENING]  
 (Deb enters while Karen is carrying a tray.)  
 KAREN: (not seeing her.) Sorry, we’re clo-. (Stops as she sees her. Deb smiles.) Oh. (Puts the tray down.) Hey. Is everything alright? Is Dan OK?  
 DEB: (Sits) Oh, the doctors are ready to release him.  
 KAREN: Well that’s good news.  
 DEB: Yeah.  
 KAREN: Let me grab some coffee.  
 DEB: Dan says he wants to come home.  
 KAREN: (Reconsiders and lets go of the coffee jug handle.) Let me grab some liquor. (Takes out a bottle of alcohol. Deb smiles.) I’m confused. I thought the divorce went through.  
 DEB: Well technically no. Dan had the heart attack before signing the paper. While signing the papers actually.  
 KAREN: You know Dan has a team of doctors who are taking care of him. Who’s taking care of you?  
 DEB: Right now, whoever’s name is on that bottle. (Drinks from the mug.) You know, maybe the heart attack is a sign.  
 KAREN: It is a sign. It’s a sign that…you’ve gotta stop doing what’s best for Dan and start…doing what’s best for you. (Deb looks down.) Maybe it’s moving on. Maybe it’s trying to put the pieces back together but either way, do it because it’s right for you. (They hold their mugs up.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. PINK PEARL – EVENING]  
 (The limo pulls up outside the ‘Pink Pearl’ strip club. All the girls get out. Brooke and Peyton hold up a drunk Haley.)  
 HALEY: Oh, if I wanted a lap dance, I would have stayed at home.  
 BROOKE: No, tonight’s gonna be a little different. I rented out the back room and hired an instructor.  
 HALEY: An instructor for what? (They take her through the VIP entrance.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. PINK PEARL – BACK ROOM – EVENING]  
 (The instructor moves around on the stage as she talks, holding onto the pole.)  
 INSTRUCTOR: Stripping is not just about taking your clothes off, it’s about getting in touch with your own body. (Haley has her head in her hand, staring at the instructor wide eyed.) Once you do that, (grab the pole again and swings around it.) You’re gonna find an inner confidence that you never…had…before. (Peyton and Brooke stare open mouthed.) I think you’ll be amazed at just how…empowering it is.  
 (Brooke doesn’t look convinced.)  
 PEYTON: Clearly(!)  
 INSTRUCTOR: So. Where’s Haley?  
 (All the girls point to her.)  
 PEYTON: She’s not gonna go for this.  
 INSTRUCTOR: Haley, just take it nice and easy.  
 HALEY: (Jumps up completely drunk and runs for the pole.) Show me the pole! (She misses the pole, goes straight across onto a chair and falls headfirst onto the floor.) Woah!  
 PEYTON: (Brooke and Peyton half stand with their hands out.) HALEY!  
 BROOKE: (Peyton gapes, horrified.) That’s (beginning to laugh.) gonna leave a mark.  
 PEYTON: (Begins to laugh.) Oh my god. (Covers her face with her hand.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – EVENING]  
 LUCAS: So look, I know ah…we haven’t really taken the training wheels off this whole brother thing, (Nathan smiles.) but I wanna ask you something. I went down to the dealership today and…found some pictures.  
 NATHAN: (Nods. He obviously already knows about them.) The ones of you in his desk.  
 LUCAS: Y-you know about those?  
 NATHAN: Its part of the reason I hated you all those years.  
 LUCAS: (sighs) Well, he said he wants me to help him with his rehab.  
 NATHAN: And what’d you say?  
 LUCAS: Said I wouldn’t be a stand-in Nathan.  
 (Nathan nods.)  
 FERGIE: Night man.  
 SKILLS: Take it easy.  
 NATHAN: (Waving) Alright guys.  
 MOUTH: Yeah, we should probably go bail Tim out.  
 NATHAN: (Standing) Well, it looks like we got ‘Tim’d again.  
 LUCAS: Yeah.  
 NATHAN: You might as well head out too man.  
 LUCAS: You sure?  
 NATHAN: Yeah, don’t worry about it.  
 LUCAS: You know what? (Picks up his backpack.) Actually, I have something for ya. (Hands his backpack over.) (Nathan smiles and opens it. He pulls out one of the jumpsuit like things that Dan’s employees probably wear. It says ‘DSM Dan Scott Motors’ on the back.) It’s for your new job. Look, Keith needs some help down at the dealership, he’s a good boss so I figured…probably pays better than what you’re making now right? (They laugh.)  
 NATHAN: Thank you man.  
 LUCAS: (They slap hands.) Later.  
 NATHAN: Alright. (Stops Lucas as he’s about to leave the apartment.) Hey Lucas? (Lucas turns.) Look uh, I understand if you have to…find out about Dan yourself; whatever you decide to do, it’s not gonna affect you and me. (pause) He’s come between us before…let’s just not let it happen again.  
 LUCAS: Thanks man. (leaves)  
 (Nathan sighs and looks back down at the uniform.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. PINK PEARL – BACK ROOM – EVENING]  
 (A woman holds onto the pole and walks around the multicoloured platform. We hear Brooke laugh. Cut to a table where Brooke and Peyton are sitting. Haley is between them, holding a glass of ice to her head. Someone who looks like the boss walks up to Brooke.)  
 BOSS: Excuse me, Miss Davis. Your credit card’s been declined.  
 (Peyton and Haley stare. Brooke rolls her eyes, opens her wallet and pulls out another card.)  
 BOSS: Thank you. (He swipes it through the machine and it comes up as ‘rejected’.) Well then…looks like we have a problem.  
 BROOKE: (Slightly scared.) Um…so what’s your policy on IOU’s? (She looks nervously at the dancing girls.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Nathan is going through a red bag when there is a knock at the door. He opens the door to the stripper.)  
 STRIPPER/SIMONE: You must be Nathan. I’m Simone. Sorry I’m late. (Unties her pink coat.)  
 NATHAN: Oh no, it’s OK but uh…the party’s actually over. (Trying to get rid of her before he does something stupid.)  
 SIMONE: Oh I don’t think so. Party’s just getting started. (Nathan is clearly uncomfortable.)  
 FADE OUT:  
 
 
 
 COMMERCIAL SET:  
 [INT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Simone puts her coat over the back of the couch and approaches Nathan in a black dress.)  
 SIMONE: Wild night?  
 NATHAN: (sitting on a stool.) More like a long night.  
 SIMONE: Hope it’s not too late to give you a show.  
 NATHAN: Oh thanks but uh, it’s OK.  
 SIMONE: (Coming on to him.) You sure? I’m already paid for.  
 NATHAN: No um…I think I’m (looks at her touching his shoulder) good.  
 SIMONE: Or at least you’re trying to be. (Nathan laughs.) It’s fine. I can call a cab to pick me up.  
 NATHAN: (nods) OK.  
 SIMONE: (Draping her arms over his shoulders.) In the meantime, I have an idea about what we can do while we wait. (Nathan looks at her nervously.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. PINK PEARL – BACK ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Brooke is looking at the credit card bills.)  
 BROOKE: I can not believe my stupid parents didn’t pay the credit card bill. (Even she knows that something’s wrong.)  
 PEYTON: We’ve got a hundred and forty in cash, at most. (Puts some notes on the table. Brooke sighs.) So what’re we gonna do?  
 BROOKE: I’m gonna take care of it.  
 PEYTON: How?  
 BROOKE: Little negotiation.  
 PEYTON: Brooke, you can not talk your way out of a thousand dollar bill.  
 BROOKE: Don’t be silly. A girl can do anything she puts miles to. (Walks to the boss. Peyton stares unconvinced.) (Flirts obviously.)Hi. I was wondering if there might be an…alternate way to settle this ball.  
 BOSS: (Laughs cruelly) It’s a strip club honey.  
 BROOKE: …Um-hm.  
 BOSS: How dirty you willing to get?  
 (Brooke laughs nervously.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. PINK PEARL – KITCHEN – EVENING]  
 (Shot of dirty dishes on the worktop. Pan to show Brooke standing over a sink, in an apron.)  
 BROOKE: How dirty are you willing to get?  
 PEYTON: (Enters in an apron also, holding a cup of water.) Well I hope this is dirty enough for you. Hey! (Whistles and jostles Haley who is sitting on top of the counter – not wearing an apron – with her head down.) Here, drink this. (Haley takes the cup and drinks.) It’ll help you with your hangover tomorrow. (Haley chokes on the liquid as she tastes it.)  
 HALEY: What’s in it?  
 PEYTON: You don’t wanna know. Drink up!  
 HALEY: You sure you guys don’t want me to help you wash the dishes? I totally can.  
 BROOKE: Absolutely not(!) The guest of honour is not doing the dishes.  
 PEYTON: Look, we’re probably gonna be here for a while so you should just take that limo home. (Haley nods and yawns.) I think Mrs Scott’s had a long night.  
 HALEY: Hm (Smiles.) Mrs Scott. (Peyton and Brooke laugh.) You guys probably think I’m crazy for getting married.  
 PEYTON: No! (reconsiders.) Alright um, maybe a little.  
 BROOKE: You guys totally have the whole Nick and Jessica thing going on just…without…stockaratsi and chickeny-tuna. (Peyton laughs.)  
 HALEY: (Smiling) Yeah well, I guess I can’t really help it if I found the guy I wanna be with my first time out. (Peyton’s face falls but she still has a smile.) Isn’t that what it’s all about? Maybe if we’re not out there looking for the one we wanna be with forever then what are we doing?  
 BROOKE: (She and Peyton are not smiling now. Haley hit a cord.) (Trying not to sound sad.) Having fun?  
 HALEY: Oh, love is fun! This kind of love is anyway. Actually, I’d really like to go home to my husband if you don’t mind.  
 BROOKE: (Holding up green gloved hands.) Class dismissed.  
 HALEY: Thank you. (They help her off the counter.)  
 PEYTON: Woah!  
 HALEY: Thank you so much for tonight. (Hugs Brooke.) Thank you guys.  
 PEYTON: You won’t be thanking us tomorrow. (Smiles.)  
 HALEY: Yeah. (Brooke laughs)  
 PEYTON: Bye!  
 HALEY: (Turns and leaves.) Bye.  
 BROOKE: (Giving Peyton a pair of gloves.) Come on goldilocks. Grime is money.  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Nathan and Simone are playing NBA Live. Nathan isn’t as hot on the console as he is in the Field House.)  
 SIMONE: I thought you’d actually be good at this game.  
 NATHAN: I was going easy on you before, I’m about to take the safety’s off now though.  
 SIMIONE: Oo, I’m shaking. (Looks at his ring.) Funny, people usually call me before the wedding. So what’s it like? Being married.  
 NATHAN: I love it. And Haley, she’s great and well she’s the one for me.  
 SIMONE: Even if one’s all you get? (She slam-dunks.) Yeah(!) Game over for you baby. (Her double meaning is obvious.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. THE LIMO – EVENING]  
 (Haley lies back in the limo.)  
 HALEY: Driver! Take me home to my guy.  
 (Shot of the limo pulling out of the drive of the ‘Pink Pearl’.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. DAN SCOTT MOTORS – EVENING]  
 (Lucas walks into the shop looking for Keith. He finds him in the office.)  
 LUCAS: Hey!  
 KEITH: Hey Luke. What’re you doing here so late?  
 LUCAS: You know, I could ask you that very same thing.  
 KEITH: (they laugh.) I’m just trying to catch up. Even though it’s ‘Dan Scott Motors’, I still wanna do well. You know?  
 LUCAS: Yeah.  
 KEITH: So what’s up?  
 LUCAS: Well um…I wanted to thank you for the job offer…and tell you that I can’t accept it.  
 KEITH: (is disappointed.) Oh…OK.  
 LUCAS: But I offered the job to Nathan. (Keith smiles.) I hope…that’s OK with you.  
 KEITH: Yeah well, I know he could use the cash.  
 LUCAS: And the guidance too. Look Keith, you’ve always helped me out…well now its Nathan’s turn. (That makes Keith happy.) Alright, well I’ll get outta your way.  
 KEITH: Oh no, you’re fine. I’m just trying to find those inventory printouts. (He puts the lockbox on the table. Lucas looks at it.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – EVENING]  
 (Nathan is looking out of his living room window.)  
 NATHAN: How long ago did you call that cab? I (He looks at his watch.) think it shoulda been here by now.  
 SIMONE: (Stands up.) Um…I have a confession to make. I didn’t call a cab. (Pulls the straps of her dress down. Nathan is beyond scared.) My car is outside. You’re really cute Nathan. You’re young. (Walks to him.) You’re athletic. You suck at video games. I was paid a lot of money to show you a good time tonight and if your idea of a good time is getting your butt kicked by a girl on Playstation, I’m fine with that but there’s also a lot of other things I’d be fine with. (Circle him like a bird does its prey.) There’s a lot of things I’m good at Nathan; keeping a secret is only one of them. I’ll be in the bedroom. You decide what you want. (Walks into Nathan and Haley’s bedroom in only her underwear.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – EVENING]  
 (The limo door opens and Haley steps out. She’s relieved to be home again. She skips up to the apartment.)  
 FADE OUT:  
 COMMERCIAL SET:  
 [INT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – BEDROOM – EVENING]  
 (Nathan walks into his and Haley’s bedroom. The lights are off and he’s looking a little nervous. He takes his shirt off and walks up to the bed.)  
 NATHAN: I want you.  
 (Camera switches to show that he’s talking to Haley.)  
 HALEY: (Shaking her head in awe.) God I love you.  
 (Nathan shakes his head slightly, pushes her back on the bed and kisses her.)  
 HALEY: How was the stripper?  
 NATHAN: Pretty good; at NBA Live. (Haley laughs.) Other than that, I had no interest in her. I actually had to ask her to leave. (Haley laughs again.) How was the shower?  
 HALEY: Um…it was educational.  
 NATHAN: Oh yeah? What’d you learn?  
 HALEY: What I already knew. You are the one that I want.  
 NATHAN: Yeah, me too. (She kisses him and gets off the bed.) Hey, where you going?  
 HALEY: Well, you know how I said tonight was educational? (Picks up the bag.) Honey, you’re gonna love the homework. (Slinks off into the bathroom and closes the door. Nathan’s lost.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. THE LIMO – EVENING]  
 (Peyton is staring out of the window.)  
 BROOKE: (o.s) I was thinking about what Haley said. (Shrugs) You know how it’s all supposed to be for love.  
 PEYTON: Kinda scary huh?  
 BROOKE: Yeah. (pause) Do you think she’s right?  
 PEYTON: I know she is. (o.s) But…that’s not the part that scares me.  
 BROOKE: So what does?  
 PEYTON: People are gonna disappoint you; I get that, I kinda expect that but…I dunno, what if you wake up one day and realise that you’re the disappointment?  
 (Brooke turns away thinking and it is pretty much obvious that there was more to last seasons ‘pregnancy’ than she ever told Lucas.)  
 PEYTON: What’s on your mind Brooke?  
 BROOKE: I was just thinking about…how we’re gonna pay for this limo. (They laugh)  
 FADE TO:  
 [EXT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL – EST SHOT – DAY]  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL – DANS ROOM – DAY]  
 (Deb is messing around with flowers on Dan’s bedside table.)  
 DEB: I spoke to the lawyer about the situation with Nathan and Haley. He says it’s gonna be a lot tougher than he thought. (She sits down.) It doesn’t look like there’s any way to invalidate their marriage.  
 DAN: There’s nothing we can do.  
 DEB: Legally. (Dan smirks.) What, you look surprised. Why, because it’s something you would say?  
 DAN: No. No, I was just thinking that…maybe we don’t have to take such drastic measures.  
 DEB: (Frustrated) Oh, snap out of it Dan! Phoenix Effect or not, I need some help.  
 DAN: They’re teenagers Deb. Once the newly wed s*x wears off, they’ll realise the only thing keeping this marriage afloat is a minimum wage job pushing pretzels with no benefits. Then money problems will kick in…and they’ll start to wonder why they rushed into the whole thing. Their marriage will probably self-destruct and we won’t even have to lift a finger.  
 DEB: (Sceptically) And what if it doesn’t?  
 DAN: (Already scheming) I had a heart attack Deb, not a lobotomy. (Oh dear, they are now two of a kind.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. ROE RESIDENCE – KITCHEN – DAY]  
 (Karen walks into the kitchen where Lucas is at the counter.)  
 KAREN: Thought you had to be at work.  
 LUCAS: Oh um…not gonna take the job at the dealership. I offered it to Nathan, he needs it more and besides, (hinting) I’m gonna have my hands full at the café.  
 KAREN: The café?  
 LUCAS: Well, seeing as you’re gonna be so busy with college and classes. (Karen smiles.) Somebody’s gotta take care of things at the café. Right?  
 KAREN: Maybe so. (Lucas smiles and tosses an apple.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. HALEY AND NATHAN’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – DAY]  
 (Nathan, wearing the uniform and looking mighty spiffy, kisses Haley. Haley is on the laptop.)  
 HALEY: Bye. Hey um, do me a favour; don’t change when you come home from work. (smirking suggestively) I’m kinda into the whole mechanic thing.  
 NATHAN: No problem ma’am.  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. STREETS – ATM MACHINE – DAY]  
 (Brooke puts her card into the ATM machine and types in her PIN. Peyton stands next to her, bored. The screen flashes ‘INSUFFICIENT FUNDS. PLEASE SEE BANK PERSONNEL TO RECLAIM YOUR CARD’.)  
 BROOKE: (Bangs the machine.) What’s going on(!) (Peyton looks.) Come on! (Bangs it again. It seems that Brooke doesn’t have money anymore.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. DAN SCOTT MOTORS – DAY]  
 (Nathan enters the shop for his first day of work. Keith looks up and they smile at each other.)  
 CUT TO:  
 [EXT. TREE HILL COLLEGE – DAY]  
 (Karen is walking up to the college, laden with books. She is a cross between nervous and happy. She walks past a fountain and into college grounds.)  
 FADE TO:  
 [EXT. SCOTT RESIDENCE – DOORSTEP – DAY]  
 (Apparently Deb has allowed Dan to move back in as she is helping him up the drive. Lucas drives up in the car and gets out. Deb sees him. Lucas nods and holds up a hand. Dan turns to look.)  
 DEB: I’ll be inside. (She walks into the house.)  
 LUCAS: (Walks up to Dan) Those pictures in the lockbox…don’t change anything. Don’t even thing for a second that they do.  
 DAN: I know I can’t change our past Lucas…but I’m hoping I can change our future. (He turns to walk but still finds it a little difficult. Realising, Lucas steps up to help him and we just have to hope that Dan doesn’t use Lucas to break Nathan and Haley up. Dan puts an arm around Lucas, smiling to himself, and they walk into the house).
