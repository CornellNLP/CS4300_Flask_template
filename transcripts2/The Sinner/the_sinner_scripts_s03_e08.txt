 Here we go round the prickly pear, prickly pear, prickly pear. 
 Here we go round the prickly pear, prickly pear, prickly pear. 
 5:00 in the morning. 
 Ambrose. 
 I can hold forensics off. 
 If you want a bit more time, just say the word. 
 Nah, send them through. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Barnhill. 
 When was the last time we had a location on Burns? 
 Uh, last night he was sitting at the Haven Residence Inn. 
 Haven't had him since. 
 Let's put out a BOLO right now. 
 State troopers, county enforcement... let's get 'em informed and then mobilize 'em. 
 Hey, I'm not doubting it's Jamie Burns. 
 I just don't understand. Why the captain? 
 I don't know. 
 He's planning something. 
 Staties are on the line now. 
 They wanna coordinate traffic stops. 
 You're in charge now. It's what the captain wanted. 
 Is that BOLO out? Yeah. 
 Okay, then start interviewing potential eyewitnesses at the clubhouse and Route Nine, okay? 
 All right. Vic Soto. 
 We need to cover anywhere that Burns has been: this house, Haven Inn, train station, wherever. 
 Yes, sir. Thanks. 
 Lieutenant Ambrose, just found this in the captain's jacket. 
 Thought you should see it. 
 Yeah. 
 That was so good. 
 Catch. 
 So... hey, Eli! See you next week. 
 Yeah. 
 How does he usually get home? 
 He walks home with one of our neighbors down the street. 
 The studio thinks they left together, but they're not sure. 
 Where is the studio? 
 In Clinton Hill... about a 20-minute walk from home. 
 Okay, so he might still be with his friend then. 
 Maybe, but he should have texted me back by now. 
 He knows to do that. 
 Dad, what's going on? 
 Look, there might be somebody who's trying to hurt you and him. 
 What? What do you mean? 
 I can't talk about it right now, I just... Okay, stay there and don't go home, all right? 
 'Cause your apartment isn't secure. 
 Somebody's coming in. 
 Look, I'll have to call you back. 
 Wait... It's gonna be okay. 
 Stay where you are. 
 The warrant rush came through. 
 His phone is turned off, but the last ping was Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. 
 What, what? What's going on? 
 That's where Eli is. I was just talking to Mel. 
 She hasn't heard from him. 
 Okay, well, we don't know anything yet. 
 He could be fine. 
 W-where are you going? 
 I'm going where that phone was. 
 Call me with any tracking updates. 
 Okay, I'll get Detective Jones at NYPD on board too. 
 Hi. 
 Hey, uh, look, I hate to call you like this and ask you to do something, but you gotta leave your house right now. 
 What? It's Jamie Burns. 
 There's been another murder. 
 Who? 
 He was from the precinct. Look, you gotta get out, okay? 
 'Cause right now you're a potential target. 
 Wait... wait, you mean like last time when he went into the city? No, no. 
 This is... he's trying to get to me. 
 He's targeting people... people that he knows are important to me. 
 Where are you? Are you... are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm all right. 
 Oh, okay, I... I'll leave. 
 Let me know where and when you're settled. 
 O-okay, thank you. 
 Don't worry. 
 You're gonna be here until when? 
 Detective Jones already ordered round the clock surveillance, so, uh, if it's not me, it's gonna be someone else rotating through. 
 Okay, let me know when you swap out. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I have to get back to Dorchester. 
 The officer is gonna be staying with you. 
 I heard. 
 We'll find Eli. 
 Why is that man doing this? 
 He's baiting me. 
 Why? 
 What did you do to him? 
 Uh, it's hard to say. 
 Dad, you gotta start talking to me now, or I'm gonna go crazy. 
 I'm gonna do everything I can. 
 Nobody's gonna get hurt. 
 We'll find him. 
 You left the back door open. 
 Harry must have warned you. 
 He did. 
 But you decided to stay anyway. 
 How's the portrait coming? 
 I-I don't know if I can do it. 
 Why? 
 Everything feels trivial, fake. 
 You've led me into a bit of a crisis. 
 Actually, I've been doubting my work, how I paint, all of it. 
 Maybe that's a good thing. 
 Maybe you're on the brink of something new. 
 And you? 
 You have been through a lot recently. 
 You know I came here to kill you. 
 I thought that might be the case. 
 But you decided to take your chances. 
 I don't think you really wanna do it. 
 Why not? 
 Because... I've seen you. 
 I see the struggle in you. 
 I've killed three people... 
 And every time, I keep waiting for someone or something, some voice... 
 God maybe... to come in and stop me, but nothing ever does. 
 And I realize that expectation is just my conscience. 
 There's no one actually watching. 
 There's no meaning. 
 There's just the before and the after. 
 It all just is. 
 And once you realize that, everything becomes so clear. 
 It's like staring straight into eternity. 
 That's an awfully lonely place to be. 
 We're all in that place from the day we're born. 
 Everyone's just too scared to admit it. 
 That's such a hard way to live a life, isn't it? 
 It's honest. 
 But what about other people? 
 You still need them, don't you? You can't just shut them away. 
 You don't want that. 
 Jamie, you could have hurt me by now, but you haven't. 
 You waited because you wanted to talk. 
 That's something. 
 You can stop. 
 You just... you choose. 
 You choose to return to the world. 
 Return to who, hmm? 
 To a family that doesn't want me anymore? 
 To Harry Ambrose the f*cking hypocrite? 
 Maybe we're all hypocrites. 
 Maybe that's the only way through a life. 
 You shouldn't have stayed here. 
 You should've left. 
 Jamie. 
 I... they're on their way. I signaled them minutes ago. 
 Well... 
 Now we're finally being honest. 
 No, please don't do this. 
 No! Oh, no! 
 No, no, no, no! 
 No, no! 
 No... ugh! 
 No, no! 
 Police! 
 How you doing? You okay? 
 Out the back! I'm on it! 
 Got eyes on him? 
 You holding up all right? 
 I need to ask you, and I'm sorry to do this now, but we don't have much time. 
 Did he mention anything about my grandson, Eli? 
 No. 
 Anything about what he was gonna do or where he was gonna go? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why didn't you leave your house when I told you to? 
 I... I knew it was dangerous... 
 But I... I just couldn't stop myself. 
 You wanted to see him again. 
 I thought that maybe I... I could reach him. 
 It was like a-a test. 
 I wanted it. 
 I wanted to survive it. 
 Harry, when you find him, please don't face him yourself. 
 Send someone else. 
 He's rattling around in your head, and you'll make a mistake like I did. 
 He's a drowning man. He'll pull you under. 
 Okay. 
 He's not heading north. 
 Yeah, but we don't know that for sure. 
 He's not doing that. 
 No, but look over here by the overpass. 
 If we miss him there, then he can slip into neighboring counties and get even further. 
 Yeah, and if he's already cleared the bridge, then he could also be moving southwest towards Milford, and we haven't even secured Route 43. 
 He's not trying to escape. 
 He's in Dorchester. 
 He could still be on Sonya Barzel's property. 
 He might have Eli somewhere in the woods... maybe near the gravesite. 
 He's got some kind of plan. 
 It's like a story. 
 He's... making a point. 
 So what do you think that point is? 
 Eh. 
 It would help... for the psychological profile. 
 He wants to torture me... 
 Bring me to the edge... where he is. 
 Captain Brian Morris was murdered this morning at the Twin Oaks Golf Course. 
 We've put out an Amber Alert for the person of interest and started a statewide search with the assistance of state and local police. 
 As this is an ongoing investigation, we're unable to release any more information at this time, but we will keep the public updated as the case progresses. Thank you all for coming. 
 Hello? 
 You're getting low on milk, Harry. 
 Might wanna pick some up. 
 Where's Eli? 
 If you wanna see him, come alone. 
 Ah! 
 Get inside. 
 Jamie... Now. 
 Put him in that chair facing the wall. 
 Don't do this. It's about us not him. 
 We need Eli right now. 
 Put him in the chair. 
 We're gonna do what he says. 
 Come on. 
 The headphones right there on the bookcase... put them on him. 
 Please, let's go outside... 
 Don't talk. Do it now. 
 It's just for a little while. 
 Sit over there by the stairs. 
 Let's go! 
 Sit. 
 I made that one just for you... for tonight. 
 Pick it up. 
 Pick it up. 
 There are only four answers there. 
 Three of them say Eli lives. One says Eli dies. 
 We play just once. 
 One in four chance. 
 Fair enough, don't you think? 
 I'm not playing this game with you. 
 Pick a number. 
 He's a kid. He has nothing to do with this. 
 You brought this on him. I never wanted to hurt him. 
 Let's you and I sort this out... without him, without guns. 
 You're the one who brought the gun, Harry. 
 Okay. 
 Just put the gun down because I know... 
 I know what you're going through, and it's my fault. 
 I understand how you feel. f*ck you. 
 If you understood me, you wouldn't have recorded me for your f*cking case. 
 Do you know what the problem is with you? 
 Look at me, Harry. You're a coward. 
 All you want is to leave this shitty little life behind... to break free, but you don't have the guts to do it on your own, so you find people like me to bring you there... to trust you. 
 And there you are saying all the right things. 
 "Oh, I'm right here with you, Jamie. 
 "Tell me about Nick. I understand. 
 I understand." 
 But when the time comes to jump, you're down your escape hatch back to your little life, and I am on the f*cking edge! 
 Out here because of you! 
 So what do you want? 
 I want you to play the game. 
 I want you to look death right in the face, right where I am... no escape route. 
 Jamie... there's no way out of this that's ever gonna satisfy you. 
 Wait, wait, wait, please! Please, please, please. 
 He's ten years old. 
 Remember when you were ten years old? 
 It was before Nick, and you were just innocent like him. Shut up. 
 You keep on trying to prove yourself... going to the edge over and over. 
 Shut up! 
 You play the game right now, or he's dead. 
 Jamie. No more bullshit. 
 I'm gonna pull this trigger. 
 You wouldn't do something like this to Kai, would you? 
 Pick a number right now. 
 No, I'm not gonna play this game. 
 Then I'm doing it right now! Go ahead! 
 Do it! 
 Go ahead! Kill him! 
 And then what? And then you're gonna have to kill me, and then you'll be alone! 
 You'll be alone, and no one will ever understand you ever! 
 Do you hear me? Ever! 
 Go ahead! Do it! Do it! 
 Do it! 
 What are you waiting for? I... 
 What are you wait... f*ck you! 
 
 
 
 Aah! 
 Run! Down the driveway. 
 Find a house! 
 You awake yet? 
 Eventually, it all catches up with you, Harry. 
 Oh, God. 
 You there yet, Harry? 
 Are you there yet? 
 Move away from the gun. 
 Go ahead. Call for backup. 
 They can arrest me, and I'll go to jail. 
 But... 
 I don't think you'll be satisfied either. 
 Will you? 
 Nick would always say... it's a quote by someone, Jung maybe. 
 "Until you bring what's unconscious 
 "into consciousness, it will control your life... 
 And you'll call it fate." 
 The more you deny what's inside of you, the stronger it'll come after you from inside. 
 It also comes from outside... like the people who come into your life just at the right time. 
 Like Nick. 
 He was my fate. 
 And now I'm yours. 
 It's like the only reason I'm here anymore is for you... to force you to admit it. 
 Admit what? 
 That we're the same. 
 We are, Harry. 
 Take it from me, you can't outrun this. 
 If it's not me, it'll be someone else coming back at you over and over and o... 
 Hey, where'd you go? 
 He's here at my house. 
 We need an ambulance. 
 Aah! 
 I called for an ambulance. They're on their way. 
 Harry. 
 Harry. 
 Please. 
 It won't stop. 
 I'm gonna have to lift up your shirt. 
 Let's see here. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 We gotta get some pressure on this. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Hold on. Hold on. Oh, my God. 
 Keep this tight. 
 Yeah. Take this. 
 Put some pressure. 
 Stay... stay calm, all right? 
 Or you'll make it worse. Okay. 
 Just keep breathing. 
 When is the ambulance coming? 
 They're coming as fast as they can. 
 You didn't have to shoot me. 
 All you had to do was call for them. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why do you hate me? 
 You always hated me. 
 I don't hate you. 
 Okay, just breathe. 
 I can't... I can't move my leg. Just breathe. 
 It's all right. I can't... I can't move. 
 Why... why can't I move? 
 Hey, hey, hey, Jamie, stay still. 
 Stay... Jamie. 
 Easy, easy. 
 Where are they? Breathe. 
 Where are they? All right, it's okay. 
 Hey, everything okay? 
 Where are they? 
 What? I can't hear you. 
 No, how long? 
 I don't know, like... minutes? 
 Isn't anybody closer? What? 
 Closer? You're brea... Can't hear... 
 They're on their way. When? 
 When are they... Soon. 
 But you have to stay calm. 
 Stay calm, and you're gonna buy some time. 
 All right. 
 I'm gonna take a look. Hang on. 
 Is i-it bad? 
 We just gotta put a little more pressure on it. 
 It just needs a little more pressure. 
 It's okay. Just breathe. 
 It's okay. Stay calm. 
 They're not gonna make it here in time, are they? 
 Oh, God. 
 Stay calm. We'll buy some time. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Harry, Harry! 
 Hey, look at me. 
 That's all you have to do. 
 Just look at me, okay? Just look at me. 
 That's all you need to do. I don't wanna die. 
 I don't wanna die. I know. 
 I know. I don't wanna go. 
 I know. I know. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 We all have to. 
 Every one of us, sooner or later. 
 You're not alone. 
 You hear me? 
 You're not alone. 
 That's it. 
 Okay. It's okay. 
 I'm not... It's okay. 
 I'm not a bad person. 
 I'm not a bad person. I know. 
 I know. 
 Just keep looking at me, all right? 
 That's it. Yeah, that's it. 
 That's it. Look at me. 
 Look at me. That's it. 
 Just look at me. Harry... will you... could you hold my hand? 
 Will you hold my hand? 
 Yes... that's it. 
 It's okay. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Where's Eli? 
 He's at the station. He's shaken, but he's fine. 
 And Melanie? She's with him. 
 Don't worry. They're gonna meet you at the hospital. 
 Come on, let's get you back over here. 
 Yeah. Man, I don't know how, but you did it again. No. 
 I made a mistake. 
 I'm gonna have to report to FID when they get here. 
 Ah, I don't... I don't think you have to worry about that. 
 Harry, it's over. 
 I'm gonna go tie things up inside. 
 I'll be right back. 
 I got about six more weeks with the cast, and then, uh, some PT. 
 God! 
 Well, it's not too bad though. 
 I can still work, and... 
 I noticed, though, the cold makes it a little sore. 
 I pulled out all my winter clothes last week. 
 I couldn't hold out any longer. 
 You look good despite the beating you had. 
 I saw Leela Burns in town yesterday. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 She's hanging in there. 
 You know, the store was busy. 
 She wants to design a logo for the business. 
 I said I'd help her out. 
 That's good. 
 I bet she holds up. 
 Yeah, I think you're right. 
 I keep thinking about him. 
 I know. 
 Can I ask you something about that last night with Jamie? 
 You don't have to. I'm sorry. 
 No, it's okay. 
 What was he like... at the end? 
 Scared. 
 He... 
 He was...
