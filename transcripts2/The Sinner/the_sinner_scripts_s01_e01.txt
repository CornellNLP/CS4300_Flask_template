 And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. 
 Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners  now and at the hour of our death. 
 Amen. 
 Are you coming? 
 Cora? 
 Come here, Cora. 
 Cora? 
 Well, once I put the order in, it usually takes about a week. 
 No, that's for the order to come in. 
 We just need a day for the installation. 
 No, I won't be there myself, but I promise you he'll do a great job, and you'll be nice and cool  for the rest of the summer. 
 How does that sound? 
 I'm... 
 I'm sorry, what... 
 yeah, yes, that's right. 
 See you later, man. 
 I'm staying in tonight. 
 All right, great, well, I will be in contact with you  next week to confirm. 
 Okay, thanks, Ms. 
 Rosas. 
 Yep, all right. 
 Okay, bye. 
 I'm still waiting on that quote from Anna,  so I wasn't able to finish the O'Neil list. 
 Come here, babe. 
 Come on, stop. 
 You did the Jacksons? 
 Yeah, it's in there. 
 That's all we need. 
 Dad, I'm gonna go home and wash up. 
 I'll meet you there, all right? 
 I know, I'm leaving too. 
 I got to say, these look good. 
 Pretty soon, I won't even need to come into work. 
 I don't think you have the guts. 
 Oh, no fun. 
 Well, then, do it. 
 Do it... prove me wrong. 
 Well, maybe I will. 
 Mason, we're with your dad all day long,  and then it's dinner with the two of them every night. 
 Yeah. 
 And I... 
 I just don't think  it's the end of the world if we ask for a night off. 
 All right, all right. 
 Or two, even. 
 You're right, you're right. 
 I just... 
 Oh, my God. 
 No, listen, no, come on, I just think it's weird  to come home and just take Lane from Mom  after she's watched him all day, cooked us dinner. 
 Having dinner with us is her reward, you know? 
 Just feels mean to do that. 
 You're such a mama's boy. 
 Oh, come on, stop saying that. 
 You are. 
 I hate... 
 I hate that term. 
 Oh, finally. 
 There's my sweet pea. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Hi, baby. 
 Hi, pokey. 
 Smells great. 
 Hi, let me get you out of there. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 He hasn't finished his dinner. 
 I told him he could get down as soon as he finishes his food  because those are the rules, sweetheart, right? 
 What did you do with Grandma today? 
 What's the spread? 
 41/2. 
 41/2? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 With who, Manny? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, God. 
 What an idiot. 
 I know, but if you want in,  you should call him right now. 
 All right, see you later, Mom. 
 Bye. 
 Good night, Lane. 
 Hey, I'll feed him tomorrow if you two want to sleep in. 
 Mom, I love you. 
 Bye, Mom. 
 It's Friday night. 
 Hmm, hmm. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 What? 
 I thought you said you were feeling better. 
 I... 
 I... 
 I am. 
 I'm just... 
 Okay. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, just give me a minute. 
 Yeah? 
 I just... 
 I just need a minute. 
 I just need a minute. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 See what you do to me? 
 Mm. 
 I'll be right in. 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, like that? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Hey. 
 Hmm? 
 It's gonna be crowded. 
 I want to get a good spot. 
 All right. 
 Mm. 
 Oh, by the way, I told Mom that we'd come over  for dinner tonight after we go swimming. 
 What do you mean? 
 Why'd you do that? 
 Just 'cause I love her so much, and I just can't... 
 just can't stay away. 
 Mason, you didn't really. 
 No. 
 She asked, and I said no. 
 'Cause I'm awesome. 
 Come on, please, please, I don't want to be late. 
 Come on. 
 Okay. 
 Don't let him get too much sun, okay? 
 It's all right. 
 You have sunscreen, yes? 
 No, we don't. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Seatbelts. 
 Bye, Lane. 
 Say "bye."  Say "bye." Bye-bye. 
 Say "bye," say "bye." Stop it. 
 Whoo-ooh! 
 Bye! 
 No time, Mom. 
 Hey, Cora, over here. 
 Hey. 
 Oh-ho. 
 You're... 
 you're already here. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Mason. 
 Heather. 
 How are you? 
 Do you guys want to join us? 
 We have room. 
 No, no, we're gonna go sit up on the beach. 
 We'll come back and visit. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I need some more water. 
 Okay, I have some right here, actually. 
 Got some right here. 
 There you go. 
 Got some. 
 You got some. 
 I got some. 
 Can I do it right here? 
 Right here? 
 That one's Grandma. 
 Then there's Mommy, my Daddy. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, I'm gonna go for a swim. 
 Can you watch him? 
 Oh, whoa. 
 Whoa, avalanche! 
 What's going on? 
 Oh, uh, important business. 
 Where's Cora? 
 I don't know... 
 said she went for a swim. 
 Okay. 
 I don't see her, though. 
 Well, when you find her, why don't you guys come on over? 
 Yeah, all right, we'll do that. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go look for Mama. 
 Bring your shovel. 
 Mommy! 
 Well, we're looking for her. 
 Mommy! 
 Cora! 
 Cora! 
 Cora! 
 Mommy! 
 Hey, what... 
 what's going on? 
 What? 
 Are you okay? 
 Mommy! 
 What's the matter, baby? 
 What's the matter? 
 You okay? 
 You hungry? 
 Mommy. 
 Yeah. 
 What were you doing out that far? 
 We couldn't see you. 
 I just kept swimming. 
 I wanted some quiet. 
 What? 
 He's fine at his swimming lessons. 
 The teacher brings him right out into the water. 
 He doesn't cry at all. 
 He's too attached. 
 Here, honey. 
 He's got to toughen up. 
 Right, buddy? 
 Good? 
 Careful... 
 Oh, I almost forgot. 
 I have a surprise for you guys. 
 Are you gonna finally put your tongue back in your mouth? 
 Ha. 
 No, it's... 
 a band I heard about. 
 They're, like, amazing. 
 I'm serious. 
 Okay. 
 Wait, where did you find this? 
 I have my ways. 
 Come on, no. 
 Babe, just turn it off, please. 
 This is Frankie's band  when he was in med school. 
 That is Frankie on the drums. 
 Really? 
 This is the biggest hook... 
 come on, turn it off. 
 No, no, it's so good! 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 Want some lotion? 
 Oil you up? 
 They're just having fun. 
 Wait, okay, okay, okay. 
 Honey... 
 oh, wait. 
 Let me play this one last song, and then I'll stop. 
 I promise. 
 This one's my favorite. 
 Guys, this one's my favorite. 
 You're torturing me. 
 You know that, right? 
 Come here. 
 Ooh. 
 Giving me love, all of you killers  Oh! 
 All of the covers  Ow! 
 Off the mattress  Stop it! 
 Get off her! 
 Get off! 
 Stop! 
 Stop it! 
 No! 
 No! 
 Hey! 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 Stop it! 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 Huh? 
 What are you doing? 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Press, press! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hold it. 
 Hold his shoulder here. 
 Press here. 
 Press here. 
 Do not let go. 
 No, get the... 
 get away! 
 Get away! 
 Hey. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Listen to me. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hold his shoulder. 
 Call an ambulance. 
 I need an ambulance. 
 There's been... 
 Someone's been... 
 Oh, my God. 
 Mommy! 
 Mommy! 
 Where's my husband? 
 I don't know. 
 Let's take you to the station. 
 I need to speak to him. 
 You can call him when you get to the station. 
 My son needs to eat. 
 His rhythm gets thrown off. 
 He won't sleep. 
 My husband forgets. 
 Ma'am, you can make a phone call the minute  we get to the station. 
 Just please get in the car. 
 Mason! 
 Mason! 
 Mason! 
 Mason! 
 Mason, please! 
 Mason! 
 So how's it going? 
 It's going. 
 Where's the suspect? 
 We're moving her to the station. 
 She already confessed. 
 Post Miranda? 
 Yeah, got all that. 
 It's crazy, man. 
 She just seems so normal. 
 Just a mom with her kid. 
 Yeah. 
 Where were you? 
 Oh, uh, I just had to pick up a couple things at the house. 
 Right. 
 Yeah. 
 Name's Frankie Belmont, 29. 
 Doctor at Cornell in the city. 
 Detective Ambrose? 
 Nathan Belewski. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 You haven't been out here in a while. 
 I can't remember the last time you guys even had a homicide. 
 It's two years, yeah. 
 Guy in Gardner killed his wife. 
 Well, I got to say, this one... 
 never seen anything quite like this. 
 Pinus strobus. 
 Hmm? 
 See those white pine across there? 
 They got a blight. 
 An ecosystem out of balance. 
 Other side. 
 Okay, please face forward again. 
 I need to see your hands. 
 Put them out there. 
 Can you please lift your head? 
 Let me see the neck. 
 Take off your shirt and hand it to the officer. 
 And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. 
 Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners  now and at the hour of our death. 
 God bless Mama. 
 Amen. 
 And your little sister? 
 Oh, yes, and God bless Phoebe. 
 Amen. 
 She's gonna be back home before you know it. 
 I don't want Mama to come back. 
 Oh, you don't mean that. 
 You do too. 
 You do too. 
 Good night, Cora. 
 Mrs. 
 Tannetti? 
 I should go to the station. 
 You need to eat something. 
 Hey, this is Mason. 
 Leave a message. 
 Hi, Mrs. 
 Tannetti. 
 I'm Detective Dan Leroy. 
 This is Lieutenant Detective Harry Ambrose. 
 I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 Thank you. 
 You are a resident of Dorchester. 
 Is that right? 
 And how long have you been married? 
 Uh, three years. 
 Any other family in the area? 
 Parents? 
 No, they're both dead. 
 Can you please tell me what's gonna happen to me? 
 Well, when we're done here, we'll be moving you  to county jail in Kingston for booking. 
 You'll be held there until your arraignment,  which is when you and your lawyer will be able  to make your plea to the judge. 
 I don't want a lawyer. 
 The... 
 the state will provide a public defender,  free of charge. 
 I know. 
 A lawyer could reduce your sentence  even if you decide to plea guilty... 
 I don't want a lawyer. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I already confessed. 
 I... 
 Just go ahead. 
 Well, Mrs. Tannetti, we have  a pretty clear-cut situation here. 
 I mean, we have signed statements  from multiple eyewitnesses at the crime scene. 
 Can you confirm that you stabbed Frankie Belmont  today at Mottowa State Park? 
 Can you say yes or no for the record? 
 Yes. 
 Can you describe how you killed him? 
 I don't understand why we have to keep going over this. 
 I told somebody at the beach,  and I just told a woman here before you. 
 I realize that. 
 We just need to confirm the details. 
 I stabbed him with the knife I was using to peel fruit  for my son. 
 Where did you stab him? 
 Mrs. Tannetti? 
 I'm sorry, um... 
 I sta... 
 in his neck... 
 and in his throat. 
 And maybe his face. 
 What's your relationship with Frankie Belmont? 
 I don't know him. 
 You had no interaction with him before today. 
 No, I've never met him before in my life. 
 Did you expect to see him there at the beach? 
 No, I don't know him. 
 I'm telling you, I've never met him before. 
 Then why kill him? 
 'Cause they were playing that music,  and they kept turning it up. 
 Mrs. Tannetti,  I realize it isn't easy being here. 
 It's normal in this circumstance to be scared. 
 I'm guessing that this isn't where you thought you'd be  when you woke up this morning, is it? 
 Think you would agree that people don't usually stab  other people because they're playing their music too loud? 
 I realize that. 
 And you can tell us anything. 
 Whatever you can. 
 I don't know. 
 I just... 
 I just did it. 
 And I don't know why. 
 You want to know what's crazy? 
 I just got a call from my daughter. 
 She knows Cora Tannetti. 
 Says she doesn't seem like the type... 
 a friendly mom, volunteers at the Y. 
 So what the hell we got going here? 
 She off her meds? 
 What? 
 No history of mental illness. 
 She takes sleeping pills sometimes, but that's it. 
 Drug test is clear. 
 So we got everything except for why. 
 Do we need it? 
 I mean, we have a confession  and, like, 20 eyewitnesses. 
 Oh, Dan, come on. 
 I'm telling you, you know, when women kill,  it's people that they're... 
 Intimately involved with. 
 I know, I get it. 
 That's the profile,  but look at her. 
 She's not the profile. 
 So you think she's lying? 
 You think she knows the guy? 
 That's not what I'm saying. 
 I'm saying the whole thing, right? 
 She attacks him in public,  and there are knife wounds all over the place. 
 That's an impulse killing. 
 It's emotional. 
 That's why this doesn't make any sense. 
 Well, maybe she just lost it. 
 I mean, people keep things bottled up,  and then something sets them off, and some poor sh1t  takes the brunt of it. 
 
 
 
 Look, Harry, I get what you're saying. 
 I do. 
 But how does this play out any other way? 
 Well, the DA's got more than they need. 
 I mean, you know? 
 And I'm already getting  too many calls on this, so you call them. 
 Get it filed. 
 All right. 
 What about my husband? 
 I've been here for hours, and no one has told me anything. 
 I'm sorry, it's too late. 
 We have to take you to county now. 
 No, what do you mean? 
 You said that you'd tell me when he came. 
 You promised. 
 He never did. 
 He didn't call. 
 Sorry. 
 Giving me love, all of you killers  Yeah? 
 Please, help me. 
 I can't sleep,  and I don't have my pills. 
 I need something. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't do that. 
 You don't understand. 
 I need it. 
 Please! 
 I won't tell anyone. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Are you coming? 
 Stop it! 
 Ahh! 
 Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. 
 Blessed art thou amongst women... 
 Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. 
 Amen. 
 Well, if it isn't Dorchester's finest sneaking around  the back door. 
 I couldn't sleep. 
 How long's it been? 
 A month? 
 So did it work? 
 Did your wife take you back? 
 How about you let me in? 
 You're lucky I don't have company,  showing up here like this. 
 You were made for me  Thank you. 
 Did you miss me? 
 Hmm? 
 So you've been having some company, huh? 
 Maybe. 
 I got this new guy. 
 He likes to bring his buddy. 
 Two of 'em, huh? 
 How does that work? 
 At the same time? 
 My tips don't exactly buy me new brake pads. 
 Don't tell me you're jealous. 
 Mary... 
 Ah! 
 Get down. 
 Hands. 
 Stars above, I know, I know  You were made for me You were made for me  You were made for me  I keep thinking about you. 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 I cannot... 
 You were made for me  We'll have our quarrels  And you'll upset me, but what can I do? 
 Baby, what can I do? 
 Mm, mm, you've been mine  Ever since I met you  And I'll never, never, never,  Never, never, never leave you  As sure as there's... 
 Detective! 
 Detective! 
 Did she know the man? 
 Did she know him? 
 Did she know the victim? 
 Detective! 
 Detective, wait! 
 Well, everything's kept in good order. 
 Yeah. 
 That's the way Cora likes it, so... 
 You haven't gone to see her yet. 
 I... 
 I mean, I'm going... 
 I was going. 
 I am. 
 I will. 
 Have you two been having trouble? 
 Nope. 
 Something's keeping you. 
 I mean, I don't really know what to say to her,  to be honest. 
 The look on her face, and the, uh, the things  that she said, I, um... 
 I mean, it was like she was someone else. 
 What'd she say? 
 You didn't mention  anything about that in your statement. 
 No... 
 'cause it didn't really make any sense. 
 After she, um... 
 after she attacked the guy... 
 she started going towards the girlfriend,  the one that turned on the music. 
 The girl, Leah, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 She said something like, "You're okay" and "You're safe"  and "He's gone now."  Like she was saving her. 
 I mean, yeah. 
 That's what it looked like. 
 Here, why don't you let me hold her? 
 No, no, I've got it. 
 Here, let me just... 
 I've got it. 
 Just let me do it! 
 Let me do it, let me do it. 
 William, William, please. 
 Cora? 
 Cora? 
 Come see Mommy. 
 Would you like to meet your sister? 
 Come here. 
 When you were a baby inside of me,  you took up all my strength. 
 Enough for three children. 
 So when Phoebe came,  there wasn't any left for her. 
 That's why she's so sick. 
 But I prayed. 
 In that hospital, I prayed like I've never prayed before. 
 And it worked. 
 You see? 
 He was testing me. 
 It's all a test. 
 Every single thing he expects of us... 
 listen to me. 
 Every single thing he expects of us,  we have to do. 
 Do you understand? 
 Do you? 
 Yes. 
 It's the only way she'll live. 
 You can sit here. 
 No touching. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 How's Lane? 
 Is he... 
 is he okay? 
 Is he... 
 Yeah, he's fine. 
 He's just, uh... 
 He's confused. 
 I'm sorry I... 
 I didn't come yesterday. 
 I mean, I... 
 I'm going over everything in my head, and... 
 it doesn't make any sense. 
 And I'm just trying to figure out why, you know? 
 I think there's something wrong with me. 
 No, I just... 
 maybe it was just, like... 
 just like a moment, you know? 
 Something that happened, and that's it. 
 Something. 
 So what's gonna happen now? 
 I give my statement. 
 Yeah. 
 And they're gonna take me to my hearing in a few hours. 
 Okay, and then what? 
 Then I'm gonna plead guilty. 
 And that's it? 
 Can't... 
 Can't you do something? 
 What about a lawyer? 
 A lawyer can't do anything. 
 I did what I did. 
 Mason... 
 Whatever you have to do now,  because of what happened,  I won't blame you. 
 Because you're gonna have to move on. 
 And this is not your fault. 
 You were such a good husband to me. 
 I never thought that I would have a normal life, and I did. 
 Cora... 
 I really did. 
 And it's because of you. 
 Mason. 
 I got to go, okay? 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, man, where you been? 
 Did you ever make it home last night? 
 I slept in the office. 
 Look, I've just been talking  to the DA's office about Cora Tannetti,  and now I'm on my way to see Leah Belmont. 
 Harry, what's going on, man? 
 I thought we were done with all this. 
 Look, if I can get Leah Belmont to confirm  that Cora Tannetti was in some kind of delusional state,  then I'm gonna bring that to Judge Baird. 
 She'll never accept that guilty plea. 
 You know you only have two hours, right? 
 The arraignment's at 4:00. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, no, I know, I know. 
 Excuse me. 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah, I'm Detective Lieutenant Harry Ambrose. 
 Patrick. 
 Right. 
 So how's she doing? 
 The nurses said she was too unstable this morning,  so they put her back on sedation. 
 I would really prefer not to do this again. 
 I already gave my statement. 
 So did you hear her say anything? 
 Either during or after? 
 How about with Leah Belmont? 
 Did Mrs. Tannetti have any kind of interaction with her? 
 I told you, I was... 
 I was sitting on my towel  the whole time, and then Frankie was bleeding,  and I was trying to stop it, and that's... 
 that's all I remember. 
 And I'm running late, so... 
 It's a Hevea brasiliensis. 
 It's a rubber plant. 
 It needs more light than it's getting. 
 So is that it? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you work out? 
 What? 
 It looks like you're in great shape. 
 Thanks. 
 Uh, yeah, sometimes. 
 I'm just saying, you know, it makes me wonder  why you didn't try to stop her. 
 Mason Tannetti, he got up from where he was sitting,  and he ran... 
 from my measurement,  it was about 15 feet... 
 and then he tackled her,  and you were, what, 4 feet away,  and you never got up off your towel. 
 So what was that? 
 Just slow reflexes? 
 I thought he had it under control. 
 What part of getting stabbed seven times is under control? 
 Look... 
 I don't know if anyone else saw this,  but from where I was sitting, I saw Frankie grab her. 
 At what point? 
 Right after she stabbed him the first time. 
 Right in the neck. 
 Frankie grabbed her arm like that. 
 And the thing is, Frankie's a strong guy. 
 He could have forced her off of him. 
 So why didn't he? 
 I don't know. 
 You know... 
 You know how the mind plays tricks. 
 You know, you get all of that adrenaline going, and, you know,  you see things that aren't there. 
 Go ahead. 
 What are you remembering? 
 Tell me. 
 It looked like he recognized her. 
 When he saw who it was, he let her go. 
 You think he knew her? 
 And then he let her kill him? 
 Mrs. Tannetti, you're charged in the complaint  with a felony violation of section 125.27  of the New York State Penal Code,  in which it's alleged that you committed a second degree murder  in the death of Frankie Belmont. 
 Having in mind the rights which were just read to you,  will you be entering a plea? 
 Yes. 
 And what is that plea?
