 You want to tell me why you dug a grave on Sonya Barzel's property? 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 I know that you met up with Nick. 
 Dinner for two, Sabbiato's. 
 What the hell? 
 Is he coaxing him to jump? 
 Here we go round the prickly pear. 
 The prickly pear, the prickly pear. 
 I think you let Nick die because he had a hold on you. 
 What would you do about it if you were me? 
 I'd accept the help I'm offered. 
 I assume you're aware of your rights and that I can't hold you here. Hold me? 
 You mean involuntarily? 
 What the hell was that? 
 You trying to get me locked up? 
 Let's go someplace and talk. 
 Jamie! 
 Couldn't hold him. 
 He's out there. He's gonna do something. 
 We have to find him. 
 Look, just say the word, and I'll go back to my room right now. 
 You can go home. 
 Why are you pushing me on this? 
 Because you need it. 
 I'm not gonna let you ghost on me again. 
 Why do you even care what I need at this point? 
 Because I believe in you. 
 I always have. 
 You feel the things other people miss. 
 And trust me... there aren't many people out there to believe in. 
 You can't just come into my life and expect me to screw everything up. 
 I have to think about Leela, too. 
 And your baby. 
 Were you ever gonna tell me about that? 
 Jamie... you want to feel the truth like we did in school. 
 That's why you called me. 
 Nothing else matters. 
 Nothing else can matter until you do that. 
 Can we get another one over here? 
 You got it. 
 Here you go, gentlemen. 
 Thank you. 
 You can leave the bottle. 
 You get away with whatever you want, don't you? 
 I got everything we need in the car. 
 Are you serious? 
 It's all right here. 
 I really f*cking hate you sometimes. 
 Pick a number. 
 He's moving directly south through Yonkers. 
 He's got to be on the train. 
 Okay. He's headed to the city. 
 Which means he's out of our jurisdiction. 
 I'm gonna call my contact at NYPD. 
 Give them the heads-up. 
 Stay on his coordinates. 
 We got to get that emergency warrant to track his cell phone. 
 On what basis? Exigent circumstances. 
 Even with a warrant, it'll be after the fact. 
 Let's just make it happen. 
 I don't see how this situation falls under our responsibility. 'Cause it's on me. 
 If he does something tonight, it's all on me. 
 Damn it, Bridget, we're late. I told you! 
 Hey, hey, hey, stop dragging your kid. 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 He just took a left down 21st Street, heading west. 
 Okay, that's just... whoa, whoa! 
 Hey. Me? 
 Ambrose. No, I'm here. 
 I'm gonna park this car. 
 It's a zoo here. 
 Mr. B? 
 Sophie Greenfield from Briarton. 
 Class of '14. 
 You don't remember me, do you? 
 You look exactly the same. 
 Oh, Sophie. Yeah, sorry. 
 My... your hair's different. 
 Yeah, just a bit. 
 This is so crazy! What are you doing here? 
 Uh, you know... looking at art. 
 Just walked in. 
 Oh, yeah, you have good taste. 
 This is one of my favorites. 
 This is an outsider artist based out of Savannah, and he literally stares at the sun and paints the retinal burns he sees in his eyelids. 
 It's insane. 
 So you... you work here? Yeah, I'm assisting. 
 I mean, I, like, have no desire to work in the art world, and the planet's basically ending, so, like, you know, I'm just figuring it out and... enjoying the city. 
 I'm sorry, I need a photo. 
 Like, I have to. Oh, I... 
 Alexis... do you remember Alexis Porter? 
 She's gonna be so jealous I ran into the Mr. B. 
 "The Mr. B"? 
 Yeah, come on. 
 You know every girl at Briarton had a crush on you. 
 What's your number? 
 Here, just send it to you. 
 So crazy. 
 It seems like you're doing well. 
 I mean... 
 Okay, I have to get back at it, but it's so cool seeing you, Mr. B. You too. 
 I had him in one location for a little while, but then he started heading north. 
 Looks like he's slowing down. 
 He's on the corner of 28th and Broadway, and he's not moving. 
 I think I might have him. Stay with me. 
 Welcome. Hi. 
 I don't see him. 
 Well, that's where he is. He hasn't moved. 
 I know where he is. 
 Jamie. 
 You won't stop, will you? 
 I'm trying to keep you safe. 
 Did you track my phone? 
 Why don't you come down from there? 
 Isn't it strange how when we stand at the edge like this, we all feel like we might lose control and jump? 
 That impulse to jump into the void, to step in front of a car... what's that about? 
 Those are just feelings. They're not reality. 
 That's what Nick would always say. 
 But if feelings aren't the truth, then what is? 
 Jamie... what are you doing? 
 Letting it decide for me. 
 And then what? 
 I go where it tells me. 
 Pick a color. 
 I'm not gonna pick a color. 
 Red. 
 Jamie, you don't have to do this. 
 Just step back. Come on. 
 Jamie. 
 I can't do anything. 
 You don't have to. 
 Let's head back to Dorchester. 
 Stop. Stop pretending you're on my side. 
 It's a f*cking joke. 
 I'm not letting you wander around this city all night. 
 As far as I'm concerned, I'm a free man. 
 You got nothing on me. 
 I'm sticking with you. 
 All night. I don't care. 
 Good idea. Drink it off. 
 Get it out of your system, huh? 
 Don't you have anything better to do? 
 Yeah, my yard could use some weeding. 
 This is harassment. 
 I'm out of my jurisdiction. 
 Why don't you find a cop and file a complaint? 
 _ 
 Does your wife know where you are tonight? 
 Hi. Can I get you guys anything? 
 Whiskey. Rye, whatever you got. 
 He's not staying. Uh-huh. 
 So that paper thing... some kind of game between you and Nick? 
 Were you playing that game the night that you targeted Sonya Barzel? 
 I thought you were off duty. 
 Why her? 
 How's she connected? 
 You're such a detective. 
 Why does there always have to be a connection? 
 You need an explanation for everything? 
 In my experience, there usually is. 
 This is random. 
 It's a game of chance. 
 That's why Nick liked it. 
 Everyone wants to believe there's some kind of order to all this or divine will. 
 This is God. 
 Chaos. Chance. 
 And Sonya? Sonya means nothing. 
 Nick used this to lead us to her. 
 She's just the unlucky person the arrows pointed to. 
 Fate. 
 There's your connection, dear detective. 
 So it could have been anybody that you were planning to put in that grave? 
 I don't understand why you listened to him. 
 Nick was the most honest person I have ever known. 
 He was also a sociopath. 
 You sure about that? 
 Look around. 
 It's a world full of sociopaths. 
 Addicts hooked on booze or money or cell phones, self-help, things. 
 Anything not to think about what's really there, which, let's face it, is death. 
 Let me tell you something. 
 You try to get honest with anyone about that, I mean, really honest, and they'll turn on you. 
 They don't want to hear it. 
 So it's you against the world. 
 Hey, hey. What are you doing? 
 Proving it to you. 
 Hey, what's up, man? How you guys doing? 
 You having a good night? 
 Yeah, it's all right. 
 You guys look ready to launch. 
 We're just hanging out. 
 Yeah, yeah, I got to say, it feels good to be out. 
 My wife and I just had a baby one week ago. 
 Congrats. Ah, sh1t is rough. 
 Seriously, I'm in town just for the night, and I'm feeling this itch, like I got to blow off some steam, like I want to f*cking regret this night in the morning, you know what I mean? Cheers. 
 Looks like you're getting some traction over there. 
 Mm. You gonna make a move? 
 Getting there. Yeah? 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I have him. 
 How is he? He's on a bender. 
 Just gonna stick with him. Maybe I'll wear him down. 
 What does that entail? A long night probably. 
 He's kind of loose... maybe he'll slip up and confess. 
 He's halfway there already. 
 Keep me in the loop. Yeah. 
 Third trimester. 
 Yeah. Hey. 
 There he is! 
 Harry. Hey, hey, hey. 
 These are my buddies, Rahm and Eyan, and our new friends, Deanna... sh1t, shi... Deanna and Kelsey. 
 These lovely ladies are just visiting from the Outback. 
 Well, I've got my work visa. She's the world traveler. 
 And this is my Uncle Harry. 
 Your uncle? That's so cute! 
 Oh, my God, it's true. You guys look alike. 
 You think? Let's go. 
 Oh, no. He's gonna try to pull me away. 
 No. He's a bit of a by-the-book type, okay? 
 He's not used to taking chances. 
 But I don't know... maybe tonight could be different, huh? 
 Come on, Harry. Have a drink with us, Uncle Harry. 
 One drink, come on. Come on, Harry. 
 Come on, man, come on. Come on. 
 You look sharp, man. Where'd you get that suit? 
 Come on, man, it's bespoke. 
 I keep trying to get Uncle Harry here to up his game. 
 Oh, come on. He looks nice. 
 This guy, this guy's got great taste. 
 Yeah, he looks like a baller. 
 She's a few ahead of us. 
 Shut up! 
 What do you do? Currency trading. 
 Oh, wow, yeah. So he is a baller. 
 Now he's gonna buy everyone here a round of drinks just to show us you can do it, aren't you, Rahm? Hey. 
 Can you believe this guy? If you keep buying, we'll keep drinking. 
 What are you trying to prove? 
 The service here sucks, man. Jamie, hey. 
 Yeah, let's take this party somewhere else. 
 Hey, you know what? I know a place. Yeah? 
 Let's go. Hell, yes, hell, yes! 
 Yes. Hey. 
 Uncle Harry for the blowout! 
 Aw, come on, Uncle Harry, come on. 
 Need a break? 
 I think we're good now. Yeah, we are. 
 Nice job. 
 Your hand... 
 I think I need a minute before we start. 
 We're gonna do things differently this time. 
 What do you mean? I checked on my phone. 
 There's a house at the end of this road. 
 We need to stop there first. 
 Why? Get in the car. 
 Nick, what's going on? 
 The house belongs to a woman. 
 We're gonna bring her down here... for good. 
 No way. This is the next step. 
 You and me, this is how we break through. 
 No, this is crazy, Nick. 
 No. The resistance you have right now, the feeling that it's wrong, it's... it's a learned response. It's not real. 
 I'm not about to kill some random woman. 
 You're talking about someone's life. 
 Jamie, you know this already. Morality is an invention. 
 You learn it. It has no basis in anything. 
 Animals kill every day. God doesn't strike them down. 
 That's a line in Nietzsche. 
 That's not exactly our reality here. 
 You have no idea what kind of freedom there is on the other side. 
 You've done this before? 
 How many times have you done this before? 
 You have to look it square in the face. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, my God. Every aspect of your nature. 
 Oh, my God, this is f*cking crazy. Jamie, you are smarter than this. 
 No, you're taking me home right now. Just stop for a sec. 
 Just listen to me. I'm not doing this. 
 Have I ever lied to you? 
 Answer the question. 
 Have I ever lied to you? 
 I was there when you were at the edge. 
 I was there with you, and I didn't let you down, remember? 
 Yeah. It's you and me. 
 You and me. 
 So forget everything else and have the f*cking courage to step out of the box you've been living in and wake up. 
 Life eats life. 
 You've been eating life since the day you were born, so don't f*cking lie, don't pretend you haven't, b-because that's what we are. 
 You have to look death in the face, and once you do, once you pass through this, trust me, Jamie... you'll be free. 
 And I'll be right there with you. 
 This is the way out. 
 There she goes. 
 When in Rome. 
 Hey, let's get some of that for Uncle Harry. 
 Uncle Harry. 
 I'm a designated driver. No, thank you very much. 
 Driver? It's New York, who's driving? 
 Come on, Harry. Loosen up. 
 This is your one life. 
 I know what this is. Has anyone ever told you you hold your tension in your back? 
 What? 
 I can see these things. I do craniosacral work. 
 You have back pain, don't you? 
 Don't want this. Cervical or lumbar? 
 Just relax a sec, relax. 
 Breathe. And this one over here, this one's a triquetra. Ah. 
 Which is the symbol for unity, 'cause, like, we're all one. 
 And then over here, that one's a bear. Yeah. 
 I love bears. 
 How you guy's feeling? Yeah, good, real good. 
 I like this view... just the two of you... 
 Making a connection. 
 You're so funny. 
 Well, it's crazy, isn't it? 
 All of us here in this hotel room, everyone trying so hard. 
 Wait, what? 
 I mean, there's this effort, isn't there? 
 Underneath it all? It's a bit desperate. 
 Like we're all trying to escape something. 
 What is that? 
 I just like the champers. Uh-huh. 
 I think it's fear. We're scared. 
 There's this big yawning void we're stuck in the middle of, and we're all just grabbing on to anything we can, right? 
 Don't look down. Oh, you know, why don't you do a line and give it a rest, huh? 
 I don't want to do a line. 
 I want to be right here with you. 
 What's wrong? 
 Talk me down off the ledge, man. 
 Come on, help me out. I'm scared. 
 You're scared, too, right? 
 Dude, that's enough. You want to do well, you want to make money, you want to screw somebody, buy stuff, be someone, for what? 
 Because it makes you feel safe. 
 But deep down, you're in freefall. 
 All of us are. 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 Look at me. We're the same, aren't we? 
 Aren't we? 
 Dude, get off! What the f*ck? 
 All right, Jamie. 
 All right, I think it's time for you and your faggot friend to leave. 
 Oh, is that what this is now? 
 This feels too gay for you? 
 Huh? 
 You need to swing your dick around, pretend you're not about to die? 
 What? Okay, come on. 
 I think it's time to go. 
 We can go. 
 Stop! 
 Jamie! 
 Jamie! Hey! 
 Dude... would you get out? 
 You hear me? 
 Come on. 
 Yeah, come on. 
 Seriously. 
 That's quite a limp you got, Uncle Harry. 
 Not a good look for a cop. 
 You should get something for that. 
 I don't take pills. 
 Oh. 
 You prefer the pain. 
 I knew there was something about you. 
 
 
 
 Oh, come on. 
 I'm stronger than you. 
 I can take you down anytime I want. 
 What's with you anyway? 
 You think you're the only person who's angry at the world? 
 No. 
 That's the problem. I'm not. 
 Well, then stop indulging yourself. 
 Oh, f*ck you. 
 Look, we all have dark thoughts. 
 We learn how to live with them, all right? 
 We contain them. 
 And how's that working out for you? 
 This isn't about me. 
 No, 'cause you seem so fulfilled. 
 How are things going? 
 You happily divorced? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I found out about you. 
 How are things going in your sunset bachelor days? 
 You feeling filled with purpose and meaning? 
 The car's over here. 
 Lonely detective goes out of his way to counsel disturbed citizens on essential life skills. 
 All right, just do something! 
 You're gonna act out, you're not gonna act out. 
 Quit talking. 
 Do it. 
 Fine. 
 Let's go. 
 Taxi! 
 You and me. 
 Drive. 
 Jamie! 
 I'm here. 234 Morgan. 
 I hear music. 
 I'm going in. 
 You guys have done a great job with it. 
 Thank you. Yeah. 
 Yeah, I... Excuse me for a second. 
 You made it. 
 Left this on for you. Okay, let's go home. 
 Is that legal? 
 Tracking my phone? 
 You want me to call your wife? 
 Hey, Sophie. 
 This is my friend Harry. 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. 
 Sophie's a former student of mine, and, uh, Harry here, he's a detective. 
 Really? Yeah, yeah. 
 He's kind of obsessed with me. 
 He's concerned about my safety, or so he says. 
 Okay. He thinks I'm dangerous. 
 What makes you dangerous? 
 Well, let's be honest. 
 Everyone's dangerous, aren't they? 
 We're all mingling, we're all behaving, but really, stability makes us resentful. 
 The animal inside is caged up and just gets angrier and angrier. 
 Because you're hurt. 
 And people who are hurt, they get angry. 
 Come on, let's go. Let's go. 
 Wasn't there something you wanted to show me? 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, upstairs. 
 Upstairs? Okay. 
 Somewhere bright. 
 An island maybe. 
 And the heat. Yeah, I feel heat. 
 She was from Barbados. Right. 
 And there's guilt, a lot of guilt. 
 Like they never wanted to leave. 
 Your grandfather never stopped feeling guilty about leaving. 
 You feel guilty, too. 
 You left home? 
 Last year. 
 That was the right thing. 
 The guilt you feel... that's not yours. 
 They don't want you to carry that. 
 Dan, can you get me some water? 
 How did you do that? 
 What's your name? Jamie. 
 It's my guidance. 
 It's like a voice I hear. 
 Everyone is part of the same field, alive or dead. 
 I just listen. 
 Can I ask a question? It's a-about a career thing. 
 Yeah. 
 Um, I quit my job two months ago, and I... 
 Wait, hold on a second. 
 There's someone near you. 
 A-a friend, an old friend. 
 He's trying to reach you. 
 What do you mean? 
 Yeah, he's... he's so close to you, it's like he's attached to you. 
 He's a... pear. 
 Prickly pear, prickly pear... 
 No, not now. 
 Are you sure you don't mind? 
 The party dies when you run out of booze. 
 We can't let that happen. Yeah. 
 Yeah, admit it, though, you want to just ditch your friend and hang out with me, right? 
 Guilty as charged. 
 How about I drive? Oh, no, I'm not drunk. 
 I've had, like 1 1/2 drinks. I'm fine. 
 You could use a break. I'll take over. 
 It's a beater. Be careful. Okay. 
 And so now, after all of that, J.J.'s gonna move in with Kyle on the top floor. 
 It's like, I don't know. 
 The communal-living thing is fine, but sometimes it drives me crazy. 
 Is something wrong? 
 No. No, why? 
 I don't know, you just seem quiet all of a sudden. 
 Sorry. 
 I was thinking about a friend who died recently. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. It's been weird. 
 I miss him. 
 How did he die? 
 We don't really know each other that well, do we? 
 No, I guess not. 
 I mean, I was a teacher, always in a position of power... not exactly an even playing field. 
 Oh, you just passed the bodega. 
 I want to play a game with you first. 
 It's kind of a bonding thing. 
 Okay. 
 What is it? 
 He's headed up Finley Avenue. 
 Yeah, I see him. He's going west. 
 Damn, he's going fast. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 You need to slow down. 
 So this friend and I... we used to play this game back in college called Taconic Roulette. 
 We'd get on a road crossing the highway and drive as fast as we could and not stop just to see if we were lucky enough to make it. 
 Are you serious? That's insane. 
 The point is you can't stop. 
 People always stop themselves right when they're on the precipice. 
 Yeah, because who wants to die? 
 I don't want to die. 
 That's not what this is about at all. 
 What is it about? 
 Facing death. 
 There's a difference. 
 Uh, is that cop car following us? 
 Uh, he just took a right on Stillwater. 
 I just made a right turn. I'm one block behind him. 
 I'm driving up Kenmore. Still got him? 
 I got him. He's heading towards Monitor. 
 Um, Mr. B, can you stop the car? 
 Can't. That's the game. 
 Mr. B, please don't... no, Mr. B, please! No... oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Okay, he's going east now. 
 He's heading straight at you. You can head him off. 
 Jamie, stop the car! Stop the car, Jamie! 
 Do you hear me? Stop the car! 
 Stop the car! 
 Oh, my Go... 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
 ♪ Come to me now ♪ 
 ♪ Like you did then ♪ 
 ♪ Pretty and slow ♪ 
 ♪ Pretty and thin ♪ Those trees. 
 They're so beautiful. 
 ♪ In a world so big ♪ Hear the crickets. 
 I can't. 
 I can't do this. 
 No, it's good. 
 It's good. 
 Okay. Ah, I'm calling 9-1-1. 
 No. Don't. 
 Jamie, don't. 
 ♪ And she loves me, too ♪ Don't. 
 You're almost there. 
 Just wait. 
 This is crazy. 
 No. It's okay. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 I can't... I don't want you to die. 
 I don't want you to die. 
 I shouldn't have pushed you so hard. 
 But you're good. 
 So good. 
 Promise me... you're gonna keep going. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Shh. 
 It's in my back pocket. 
 It's in my pocket. 
 What? 
 What, Nick? What'd you say? 
 It's in my pocket. 
 Just come out back. 
 Nick. 
 It's in my pocket. 
 This has got to stop. 
 You have to tell your wife... what is happening to you. 
 I'm gonna wait out here till you do. 
 Will you be honest with me for a second? 
 Just tell me the truth. 
 Do you ever feel lonely? 
 Yeah, I do sometimes. 
 I mean really lonely? 
 No matter what you do or who you're with, you... you still feel it. 
 Like you're walking around, and you can feel the whole universe out there, this huge thing just... going and going and going, and everyone around you is just... knocking into everything and bruising everyone and themselves. 
 And you just feel so lonely, you could scream. 
 Tell me I'm not crazy. 
 Tell me you know what I mean. 
 I do. 
 Hey, Harry, it's Devan from the NYPD. 
 So I kept an eye out for any homicides in the Brooklyn area. 
 It's probably nothing to do with your suspect, but I thought I'd let you know we had one early this morning on Morgan Avenue in Greenpoint.
