 Hit me, m*therf*cker! 
 Stop, stop, stop! 
 We're done, we're done! Sit down, it's ok. 
 That's it, fight's over. 
 We're done. 
 You're a great athlete, Nate. I don't know if you're a great fighter. 
 I saw everything! 
 I know about all your little boyfriends, all the texts. 
 And the random hookups. You're a f*cking homo. 
 You can't tell anyone. 
 Alicia, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Show me you can throw a one two three. 
 Nice! 
 I want you to get the sh1t outta this chick, you understand me? 
 Big checks and great s*x. 
 I got the test back this morning. Ryan popped. 
 For what? 
 Cocaine. 
 Forget his career. This could put him back in prison. 
 Ryan Wheeler. Jay Kulina. 
 Friends, rivals. I'd buy a ticket for that. 
 Mom! Mom! She f*cking OD'ed. 
 Can you get her to breathe? 
 * 
 You're not gonna change her. 
 I'm not trying to change her. I'm trying to help her. 
 I made an investment with a friend of mine. 
 30 thousand dollars to Chapas? 
 If you f*ck me on this, I'm gonna kill you. 
 You're gonna have to find me first, m*therf*cker. 
 Now he's disappeared with my money. 
 What did you do with my money, m*therf*cker? 
 You're not gonna shoot me, man. 
 Don't do that. Aaah! 
 Chapas is dead. 
 What? 
 I'm gonna move to San Francisco. Have the baby there. 
 This baby is a gift. Don't leave me. 
 He's not necessary, you know? You'll always be taken care of. 
 Everything is about you! 
 It's about us! 
 It's about how me and this baby can save you. 
 Well, you know what? I don't want that job anymore. 
 Woman: Construction seems to be everywhere. 
 [Horns honking and jackhammering] 
 So, if you're in the Santa Monica area, traffic is being transitioned from Wilshire...  
 Alvey : Come on, let them f*cking go! 
 A tipster just reported in there's an accident on the...  
 [Thumping and horn honks] 
 Come on! f*cking hell! 
 [Woman on radio continues indistinctly] 
 Jesus f*cking Christ! 
 [Horn honks] 
 Come on! Let somebody through! 
 f*cking get in the car! 
 [Horn honks] 
 Get in the car! 
 Get back in your car before I knock you out, you stupid. 
 Get in your car! 
 [Horn honking] 
 Get the f*ck in the car, you motherfuck! 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 f*ck! 
 Pull up! 
 Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? 
 Take your seats. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
 Well, this is a fantastic day for King Beast Promotions. 
 Jesus m*therf*cker! 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Hey, Ron. How's it going? 
 Man: As well as a lot of congestion on the 5. 
 When? 
 How? 
 What the f*ck happened? 
 Is she okay? 
 [Sighs] 
 Put her on the phone. Ron. Is she okay? 
 Let me talk to her, Ron. Let me talk to her. 
 No, let me... Just let me f*cking talk to her! 
 Let me talk to her! Ron! 
 All right, listen, listen, Ron, Ron, Ron. 
 Tell her I love her. 
 Please. 
 All right. Yeah. 
 [Screaming] 
 f*ck! 
 f*ck! 
 [Screams] 
 [Jackhammering and honking intensifies] 
 [Jackhammering and honking stops] 
 Garo : Alvey. Alvey? 
 You have a question. 
 Oh, I missed the question. What was it? 
 I was saying your two top fighters, one of whom is your son, are squaring off against each other. 
 How do you manage a situation like that? 
 We try to keep it as routine as possible. 
 I work with both fighters individually, like I would any other fight. 
 My son Nate will be in Jay's corner, and Joe Daddy will be cornering Ryan. 
 Someone's got to lose this fight. 
 What do you say to the guy who doesn't get his hand raised? 
 I tell him what the Greeks say. 
 "The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must." 
 This question is for Ryan and Jay. 
 Ryan, you first. 
 What weaknesses do you see in Jay, and how do you plan on exploiting it? 
 Um... [Clears throat] 
 Jay does some things really, really well. 
 He's... He's awesome in the scramble. 
 He's a really great striker. 
 Um... 
 But as far as... as far as weaknesses, I mean, he's, um... 
 I mean, he's decent on the ground, so I'll have to look out for some submissions, but... 
 You know, he's nothing special, and, uh, I'm just gonna treat him like anyone else. 
 I'm gonna... I'm gonna hold him down, I'm gonna smother him, then I'm gonna beat him up until he... he asks me to stop. Right, Jay? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Jay, same question. 
 That's a hard question for me to answer because Ryan Wheeler has no weakness. 
 Look at him. [Inhales deeply] 
 That's God's work. 
 That's 155 pounds of get-down with a smile to take your breath away, ladies. 
 I'm serious. This man is put together beautifully. 
 Stronger, faster, more elegant than any man has a right to be. 
 So, my humble goal, sir, my humble goal is simply to stay in that cage with this angel of God and to bask in his splendor, yes, sir. 
 Now, as for a game plan, Lord, if I know. 
 I probably am just gonna lay and pray till he's tired of whipping my ass. 
 And when this thing is done and over, and my hide is properly tanned, I hope to have a picture with this champion and then to return to the simple life to which I have become accustomed, because that, ladies and gentlemen, that would be the very best result that I could hope for. 
 Holy Lord! 
 Garo : Jay Kulina, ladies and gentlemen. 
 It's gonna be the most exciting fight in MMA history. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Look at this. 
 Alvey. 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 May I ask why you were late? 
 No. 
 What happened to your hand? You beat someone to death? 
 Not yet, Garo, but keep asking me f*cking questions. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So handsome, but always so angry. 
 Smile. 
 [Grunts] All the time. It's exhausting. 
 All right, all right, take your hand off the mat. 
 There you go. 
 Nice. Nice. 
 Now, listen... It's not enough to just learn these techniques, okay? 
 You have to obsess over them to be effective. 
 Make it a part of who we are, feel it in our bones. 
 That way, when we're caught in a situation, we're under pressure, that move comes to us without us even thinking about it. 
 Fluid motion, fluid motion. 
 Like water. Come on. 
 It saves us. It helps us win. 
 And we like to win. Am I right? Let's go! 
 All right, hold up. Everybody watch this. 
 Gives up no control, beautiful positioning. 
 Very good. Very good. 
 [Sighs exhaustedly] 
 It's okay to love what you do. 
 All right, everybody, bring it in. 
 Bring it in. Good work. 
 Hands in. Let's go. 
 One, two, three. 
 Navy St.! 
 Same time tomorrow. Good work today. 
 How's Alicia? 
 She's fine. 
 How's her weight? 
 She's about five pounds over. She's with Ryan. 
 All right, stay on her. 
 I'm not gonna make the weigh-in. Can you handle it? 
 Yeah. 
 What the f*ck happened in here? 
 What happened to your hand? 
 I got some bad news. 
 Lost my temper. Just focus on Alicia, okay? 
 You call me if there any problems. 
 What kind of bad news? 
 Can you handle it or not? 
 Yo. Ryan. 
 Ryan : Yo. 
 You know Mario Goldsmith from Split Lip, huh? 
 Mario's embedding himself with me today. 
 We are peeling back some of my layers. 
 We have a fighter cutting weight, so... 
 Oh. 
 ... if you could stay out of the way, I'd really appreciate it. 
 Not a problem. 
 Hear ya. 
 [Whispering] Don't worry about it. 
 He gets a little cranky. Come on. 
 Don't take it personally. 
 Thanks. My pleasure. 
 Who's out there? 
 Just some dickhead reporter that's following Jay around. 
 Why isn't he following you around? 
 They already know my story. 
 Dude. 
 You know this sh1t expired a year ago, right? 
 Oh, my God. Please just shut up. 
 [Laughs] That is some ghetto-ass sh1t. 
 Oh, God. f*ck you. I'm serious. 
 Oh. I am not in the mood. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you. 
 I'm not embarrassed. 
 What the f*ck was that look for? 
 No look. I just... 
 You're looking at me f*cking sideways like I should be embarrassed. 
 Alicia, relax. 
 I am f*cking relaxed. 
 Okay, okay, well, lower the volume just a notch. 
 Lower the volume? 
 Seriously? 
 You f*cking lower your volume, girl. 
 [Laughs] 
 I'm sitting here, and you're up my ass about a stupid f*cking driver's license. 
 I'm dying, dude, seriously. 
 Okay, hey. Let's just drop it. 
 I don't f*cking care. It's your license. 
 It's a good picture, though. 
 How old were you? 
 I don't know, like 20. 
 Well, you were really pretty back then. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Laughs] Just shut up. 
 Yeah, but I took your mind off the heat, right? 
 Come on. Let's move around. 
 Let's move around. Got to stay sweating. 
 Let's go. There we go! Come on. 
 Mario, let me introduce you to Jacob. 
 Jacob... is a truly evil machine, but for my money, it's the best way to simulate a hard fight. 
 I do sets of seven. 
 30 seconds, all-out. 
 Sprint, rest, sprint. 
 Lactic acid builds up to the point where your legs won't do what you want them to do. 
 Now, at that point, two things are happening. 
 The machine is trying to break me. 
 But he's also training my mind and my body not to be broken. 
 Of course, that's what a fight is all about, right? 
 Can we get a demonstration? 
 Good? 
 Yep. 
 My apologies, Mario. 
 This is the real behind-the-scenes sort of footage. 
 It looks like the machine is not working right now. 
 I'll be back. 
 We'll do a reshoot? 
 Yeah. 
 Great. Sorry. All right. 
 Cut right there. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Jacob's Ladder is broken. 
 I know. 
 [Russian accent] What are we going to do about it? 
 Gonna call somebody. 
 Well, come on, man. I got the press here. 
 This is more than embarrassing. 
 I promise, there are more embarrassing things about you than the Jacob's Ladder not working. 
 Ha! 
 You know, I got to be honest, Nathaniel. 
 I didn't want to say anything, but I just have to let you know. 
 I've noticed some slippage in the gym as of late. 
 Filthy mats, people not racking their weights. 
 Don't bitch at me, Jay. 
 I don't want to f*cking hear it, okay? 
 Oh. 
 Well, welcome to upper management, young man. 
 It's your job at some points to be fielding complaints from paying custom... 
 It's been three months. 
 Okay, three months. Why doesn't he hire somebody? 
 I'm f*cking drowning here. 
 I'm drowning in bills and f*cking vendors, and nobody ever pays on time. Not one person pays on time. 
 When I try to call them, they don't f*cking pick up the phone, so... 
 That is a terrible job. 
 It's a terrible job. 
 Here. 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 I am not cut out for white-collar work. 
 I have neither the intellect nor the understanding of basic mathematics and bookkeeping. 
 You... Yeah, you... are the best bad choice that we have. 
 But I'll tell you what. 
 I will call the repairman for Jacob's Ladder, so why don't you write down the phone number for me? 
 Thank you. 
 Your faithful older brother coming to the rescue yet again. 
 Have you seen Dad's office? 
 No. 
 Man : Jay! 
 Marito, you rolling all right? 
 Shut the door. I don't want the camera crew to see this. 
 f*ck. 
 How was he at the press conference? 
 His hand was f*cked up. 
 I think he was hungover. 
 Yeah, he said he got some news. 
 About what? 
 He didn't tell me. 
 He seemed depressed. 
 Like, f*cking low. 
 Ryan, you got a sec? 
 Love to ask you a couple questions. 
 Sure, man. Yeah, yeah, anything you want. 
 No camera, though. 
 Really? 
 Okay. 
 You sure? 
 What's your question? 
 Uh, you're a couple weeks out. How you feeling? 
 Hey, did you know that Jay can ride a unicycle? 
 Ask him. He'll show you. 
 And, uh, and also he's done some modeling, so... that's interesting. 
 Anything else? 
 Uh, we're all good. 
 Good to see you. 
 There you go. Drop. 
 There we go. There we go. 
 There we go. Hit the body. There. 
 Right hand. Dig deep. 
 One... two... 
 Put some on that sh1t. 
 There we go. One-two. 
 Boom. Boom. 
 Yep. 
 Three... four... five. 
 This side. Hey. 
 Burn it out, burn it out. 
 Everything you got! Everything you got! 
 Everything you got! 
 And you're done. Aah! 
 f*ck yeah! There we go. 
 [Grunting] 
 All right, here we go. 
 I'm gonna vomit. 
 Don't do that. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Hey, what'd you eat today? 
 An apple, a hard-boiled egg. 
 All right, that's not enough. You need calories. 
 Ugh. 
 Take care of me. 
 Please, please, please, please. 
 Ohh. Eat this. 
 Oh, I'm pathetic. 
 Ah, you'll get there. 
 You're paid to say that. 
 Oh. 
 How long you been fighting? 
 My whole life. 
 Serious? 
 I'd love to see you fight. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Yeah? 
 Ah! He's back! 
 My man! 
 Look at that fine Italian leather, huh? 
 Yeah, you know it. 
 You don't call, you don't write. You didn't tell me you were coming. 
 I see your name signed in the registry. 
 Last minute. It was last minute. 
 Get over here. 
 Ah, it's good to see you. 
 Good to see you. 
 You, too. 
 All right? What happened there? 
 Oh, work-related. 
 Isn't it always, brother? 
 What the f*ck is this? 
 Tore my Achilles. What? 
 How'd you do that? 
 Walking up a flight of stairs. 
 [Laughs] 
 Come on. 
 That's it. That's it. 
 The fucker's zipped up like a window shade. 
 You know what that means, man. You're getting old. 
 Ah, yes. f*ck you. 
 Demoralize the living sh1t out of me, you know? 
 Mortality is coming down the tracks, and I can't outrun it. 
 No, you cannot. 
 For me? Yeah. 
 Mahalo. De nada. 
 Ahh. Last minute, huh? 
 Last minute. 
 What the f*ck's going on with you? 
 All right. 
 Here you go. 
 Drink this. 
 That's 10 grand for the month. 
 I'm putting you on retainer, okay? 
 You got other clients, I want you to fire them right now. 
 I got a f*cked up, busy schedule. 
 I need you to be available to me, all right? 
 Mornings, evenings, whenever I can fit you in. 
 Be flexible. 
 I'm getting old. 
 I got to turn this sh1t around. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is that enough? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Let me know what you need. 
 You got it. 
 My assistant will send you an e-mail with some times. 
 We'll figure it out, okay? 
 You kicked my ass today. 
 Don't stop doing that. Don't stop doing that. 
 All right? If I tell you to stop, don't stop. 
 Kick my ass. Kick my ass. Might need a safe word. 
 All right. All right. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Indistinct shouting and hard rock playing] 
 [Music stops] 
 I have no problem fighting Ryan. 
 At all. He feels the same. 
 You know, we both knew this day was coming. 
 [Music resumes] 
 [Music stops] 
 He's working hard. He's doing everything he can. 
 I'm just grateful that he's stepping into the cage with me. 
 [Music resumes] 
 Ryan is a part of our family. 
 [Music stops] 
 He's like a brother to me. 
 And Alvey sees him as a son. 
 [Music resumes] 
 Go, go, go! 
 We push each other. 
 Everyone wants to be the alpha. 
 f*ck the beta. 
 f*ck the other wolves. 
 They bring the kill home to me. 
 Most people are happy in the middle. 
 Got safety in numbers. 
 But the alpha can't tolerate that. 
 It f*cks with his control elements. 
 When you have two of us in any given space, it has to be settled. 
 It's natural law. 
 Wired up? 
 Camera's ready. Should we do this? 
 I'd like to finish my chicken, if you don't mind. 
 Oh, hey, I got it. I got it. 
 I can't get it off. I got it. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Get it off. 
 One foot at a time. Here we go. 
 Here we go. There we go. 
 This f*cking sucks. 
 It sucks every time. We all go through it. 
 You got this, okay? 
 Here we go. 
 Here we go. 
 No. I can't see. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You ready? 
 [Sighs] 
 What? 
 Uh... f*ck. 
 What? What?! 
 f*ck! 
 [Laughing] One f*cking 17. 
 f*ck you, man. 
 114! 
 114. [Laughs] 
 You f*cking made it. That's a f*cking warrior. 
 That's a warrior. There you go. 
 Now it's f*cking fun time, right? 
 Now it's fun time. 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 Mario : All right, I'm here with Jay Kulina. 
 Jay, thanks for sitting down. 
 I'm happy to be here, Mario. 
 Now, you're really well-known in Southern California, but for the rest of the country, for those who don't you know you, how would you describe yourself? 
 Dark hair, pale skin, medium height, athletic build, and prone to violence. 
 Others would say talented but reckless, undisciplined. 
 The perception is that you take a lot of unnecessary risks and leave yourself open to punishment. 
 Is that fair? 
 I'm not a point-sparrer. 
 I finish fights. You have to be aggressive, and if that leaves me open, well... such is life. 
 Do you enjoy fighting? 
 Immensely. 
 Not all fighters do. 
 Well, I admire those gentlemen. 
 I can't get myself to do a goddamned thing I don't love. 
 You just dropped an entire weight class. 
 Couldn't have loved that. 
 It was transformative. 
 It was horrific. I felt crazy. 
 All my nerves were so gashed open, I thought if I didn't cauterize myself, I might die. 
 But I didn't. 
 You know, I pushed past that breaking point, and I just... soared. 
 And that's the sort of knowledge that you can only get from a weight cut like that. 
 Is that a prerequisite for fighters? 
 What's that? 
 Pain, suffering. 
 A massive cut like that, that's basically a form of self-punishment. 
 Yeah, well, you know, it's also a form of weight loss. 
 Right, Mario? 
 Why do you fight, Jay? 
 I fight because it comes natural to me, and I'm good at it. 
 You're being glib. 
 Look... people have their thing, but you're right. 
 There's not a fighter I don't know who doesn't have some sort of deep, personal trauma. 
 And in your case, um, I assume you're talking about your mother. 
 I'm not talking about anything specifically. 
 I understand she left the family. 
 She's a heroin addict. 
 We're not talking about that right now. 
 There's these rumors that she was a s*x worker. 
 We're not gonna get into that. 
 All right, well... How has it shaped your life? 
 What's your relationship with her now? 
 I want you to cut that question. 
 Why? 
 Just skip it. 
 It's a valid question. 
 Skip the question or cut the camera. 
 Jay, it's a valid question. 
 Cut the f*cking camera. 
 It's a valid question. 
 f*cking valid question? 
 Jay, it's a valid question. 
 Valid question? How long have you had that question in your f*cking chamber, huh? 
 Have you just been sitting on that one all day? 
 Yeah, I have. We haven't gotten to that part of the interview. 
 Can you turn the f*cking camera off? 
 All right, Jay. 
 Turn the f*cking camera off. 
 You don't have to be a dick about it, all right? 
 I'm not being a dick about it. 
 You turn this f*cking camera off, and I think this interview is over. 
 Why don't you get the f*ck out of my house? 
 This is what you agreed to. 
 Don't touch the equipment. 
 I agreed to a f*cking interview about my fight, not about my family. 
 Can you not touch the equipment? 
 Interview's over. Thank you. 
 Get the f*ck out of my house. 
 Thanks. Right out here, let's go. 
 Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Her father called me this morning, man. 
 Minute I heard his voice, I knew it was f*cking bad. 
 I thought something happened to her. 
 Oh, man, I'm... I'm sorry. 
 That's terrible. Yeah. 
 He tell you what happened? 
 She wasn't feeling good, so they... 
 Bad enough that they took her to the hospital. 
 And, uh... 
 No heartbeat, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 You talk to her? 
 No. You haven't talked to her. 
 No, her father said she doesn't want to hear from me. 
 You know, I... 
 I'm not gonna press it. 
 No, man. You know what they say, right? 
 Time heals all. 
 She probably needs some time to get herself together. 
 Just give her a few days. 
 It was never f*cking right, though. 
 Ah. 
 Kid was f*cked from conception. 
 Come on, man. Come on. 
 This sh1t happens. 
 Okay? 
 It happened with me and my ex after the first kid. 
 And I tried to tell her, "Look, there's no reason." 
 There's nothing that either one of you did. 
 It just... It's just hard. It's hard. 
 She went it alone, man. 
 I wasn't there. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 To my son, whoever he may have been. 
 To us, whoever we may be. 
 Amen. 
 Hey, are you hungry? Nah. 
 Yo, man, I can have them send some steaks over. 
 No, man. I'm f*cking beat. 
 I'm probably just gonna pass out. 
 Okay. 
 I'll let you get to it, all right? 
 [Grunts] 
 You're gonna be good, all right? 
 Thanks, man. 
 Hey, you know what? I'm gonna send some steaks over. 
 No, no. I'm gonna send some steaks. 
 You got to eat. 
 [Door opens, shuts] 
 [Cellphone dings, video game stops] 
 [Video game resumes] 
 [Cellphone dings, video game stops] 
 [Video game resumes] 
 [Door opens] 
 How was the run? 
 It was excellent. 
 Do you want some food? 
 No. No, I ate. Thank you. 
 You sure? Yeah. 
 Did you hear from Alvey? 
 No. Tried Lisa, too. I just got her voice-mail. 
 Ahh. Me, too. 
 [Video game stops] 
 Hey. 
 Check this out. 
 The f*ck? 
 Bob, the guy I'm training, put me on retainer for the month. 
 10 grand? 
 Man, 10 grand for the f*cking month? 
 Yeah, well, I'm a really good trainer. 
 He's rich, dude. 
 He just wants me to be available whenever he needs me. 
 It's so f*cking easy. 
 So, you're officially a personal trainer now? 
 It's 10 grand. 
 Okay, Dad's not paying me sh1t. 
 This will cover me until I get another fight, all right? 
 Hey, I can help with Mom's rehab. 
 Mom's taken care of, Nate. 
 She's taken care of. 
 All right, well, what if something else happens? 
 Then you know what? You should start a f*cking 401(k), a pension plan, you know? 
 Save the money for yourself. 
 Years, they go by, you know? sh1t comes fast. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Groans] 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Hey, Coach. 
 Alvey : Did you, uh... Did you eat something? 
 Actually eating right now. 
 Okay. Got it. 
 Where you at? 
 Uh, something came up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Listen, Alicia, I'm not gonna be able to be in your corner tonight, okay? 
 Why not? 
 Well, it's... it's very personal. 
 I don't want to get into it right now. I'm sorry. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, fine, fine, fine. 
 Ryan's gonna be in your corner, and, uh, and Jay and Nate will be there, too. 
 They know what to do, okay? 
 Understand? I want you to go in there, I want you to take care of business, and you call me as soon as you're done so I know everything's okay, you hear me? 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm gonna focus on what I can control. 
 And? 
 And I'm gonna beat this chick's ass. 
 That's it, girl, exactly. 
 All right. Go do your thing. 
 All right. Thanks. 
 I'll call you right after. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 [Cellphone closes] 
 Punch. 
 Grab on. 
 Yeah? Good. 
 Remember the game plan. Remember to breathe. 
 Jay : Juan, looking good. 
 Joe, will you warm her up real quick? 
 I'll be right back. 
 Alicia. 
 The Kulina boys. 
 What's up, player? 
 Whoa, look at this snazzy suit. 
 Where's your paparazzi? 
 Take a joke, man. I'm just f*cking with you. 
 You look good. Thank you. 
 I feel good. 
 Okay. 
 Ryan : What the f*ck? 
 You're being a dick. 
 He's f*cking with me, I'm f*cking with him, dude. 
 It's fine. 
 Did you talk to my dad? 
 No, man. He just leaves me a message. 
 He's like, "Corner her." I try to call him back. Nothing. 
 What's going on? 
 What the f*ck? 
 [Cellphone buzzing] 
 Ryan : How you feeling? She warm? 
 You know what? I've been thinking, man. 
 Hawaii's done. 
 It's done. 
 Okay, I might just rip this place down to the studs and just start fresh. 
 Go with more of a... a mission-style or maybe mid-century modern. 
 But none of that Philippe Starck crap. 
 Feel like you're living in a Target. 
 No. Mission-style feels right. 
 It feels like California, you know? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Then I got to rename the place and got to rebrand and all that deal and website and everything. 
 You know what? f*ck it. [Laughs] 
 f*ck it. I'm stuck with the Aloha spirit.

 No. No, no, no. 
 I mean... I mean about the kid. 
 What you talking about? 
 I just... I don't feel anything about him. 
 Oh, man. 
 You know. 
 No. Listen. Listen. 
 I put my f*cking fist through a glass cabinet, right? 
 I f*cking destroyed my office. 
 I destroyed it. 
 I wasn't really that mad. 
 You know what I mean? 
 I mean, I just figured that's something I should do. 
 Mm. 
 But as far as the pain is concerned, I just... 
 I never f*cking felt any pain. 
 Listen. Listen to me, man. 
 sh1t like this is going to come out 10 different ways before you're out the other end. 
 Okay? There's no right way to feel. All right? 
 You just give yourself room, and you let it happen. 
 That's it. 
 Yeah, but what the f*ck is wrong with me that I can't feel this? I can't f*cking feel it. 
 Well, currently, my brother, it's because your brain is filled with codeine. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Drank. 
 Listen, man, you're gonna feel this. 
 Real talk, man. You're gonna feel it. 
 One way or the other, it's gonna come out. 
 You just got to let it happen, man.

 Sometimes I forget where you're from. 
 What the f*ck's that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing. You're just a Miami street rat. 
 It's not your fault. Nobody taught you any f*cking manners. 
 You know what? You should finish that f*cking bottle.
