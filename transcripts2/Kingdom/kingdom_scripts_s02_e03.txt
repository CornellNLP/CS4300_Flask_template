 Do I have to get the mediator back in here? 
 No. 
 I'm gonna sign it. 
 [Laughs] 
 I didn't think it would be hard. 
 I can't believe you're having a baby. 
 Really? We're gonna get into this now? 
 You're almost 50. 
 And? 
 How do you think the boys feel? 
 Who gives a sh1t, Christina? They're grown men. 
 Well, they're still our children. 
 And why do you get to start over? 
 You do too. 
 [Scoffs] 
 That's what this is about. 
 What are you doing? What is this? 
 Do I need to get a real lawyer to handle this? 
 Could you just not be an asshole today? 
 I mean, I made this so goddamn easy for you. 
 You agreed to everything. 
 If there's something else that you want... 
 I don't want anything else. 
 Are you gonna sign it or not? 
 Yes. 
 Then do it.

 Hey, Ryan. 
 Jesus, f*ck, Keith! 
 [Liquid splashing] 
 What are you doing? 
 It's me, Keith. 
 Yeah. I see. 
 Just going to the bathroom. 
 [Zipper zips] 
 When did you get out? 
 This morning. 
 You should have called me, man. I would have come to get you. 
 Oh, I didn't wash my hands... 
 But, yeah, no, it was just really early this morning. 
 I didn't want to bother you. 
 [Exhales, chuckles] 
 Hey, Ryan. 
 What? 
 Is that your red sports car? 
 It looks like a bad ass car, Ryan. 
 Yeah, well, it's Joe Daddy's. 
 It's, uh, you know, he's letting me borrow it. 
 [Scoffs] Man, that's cool. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're pretty sweaty. We should put on new shirts. 
 Yeah, let's get inside. 
 Did you walk all the way here? 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh. Where's the couch? 
 [Key clanks] 
 It's... 
 It's in the garage. 
 Well... 
 This is all leather. 
 Yeah, I thought maybe we could use an upgrade, huh? 
 Is it Corinthian? 
 I don't know. 
 It feels like it. 
 It must have cost you a fortune. 
 Well, it's 90 days interest-free. 
 Payment plan, Ryan? 
 Those things are a trap. They ruin people's lives. 
 Hey. It's under control, man. 
 I promise. 
 Yeah, well, that's exactly what my dad said. 
 Except he didn't call my mom "man," and his voice was a lot louder, but... 
 And no, that was  not the hammer fight. 
 But... 
 I mean, what do you think? It's better, right? 
 I don't like it, Ryan. 
 I love it. 
 f*ck yeah, dude. 
 [Laughs] f*ck yeah. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I can't believe it's ours. 
 I mean, we're gonna hang out in here 24 hours a day. 
 We can eat dinner in here, and we can watch everything. 
 The TV is, like, the size of a movie screen. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Beats the sh1t out of prison, right? 
 Beats the everything out of prison. 
 So, you want to watch a movie? 
 You go ahead, man. Enjoy. 
 Where are you going? 
 I got to train, and then I'm gonna go see my dad. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yeah. 
 We'll hang out when I get home. 
 Okay. 
 All right? 
 Hey. 
 I'm glad you're back, huh? 
 I'm glad I'm back. 
 Hell yeah. 
 Here. Fire it up. 
 Relax. 
 Whoa, what are you... 
 Legs up, legs up! 
 [Laughs] 
 Welcome home, big guy. 
 I'll see you later. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door closes] 
 Laura : You know what I want to do? 
 What is that? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I want to stay here with you all day. 
 Mm. 
 And then when it gets dark and we're starving, we can walk and get some Sushi, get a little drunk, and come right home. 
 f*ck... off. 
 [Laughs] Oh, that's right. I forgot. 
 Yeah. 
 You have to go. 
 Yeah. 
 I get to stay here all alone. 
 You're an evil, evil girl, you are. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Yes, ma'am, you are. 
 Stop, stop, stop. I got to go. 
 [Laughing] No, you don't. 
 Yes, I got to go to work. You know. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yes. 
 Hugs don't pay rent. Daddy's got to go to work. 
 Well, let me at least get this makeup off. 
 I want you to come to my brother's fight tonight. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Why... why are you looking at me like that? 
 I just... Fighting's not my thing. 
 Have you been to a fight? 
 No. 
 So then how do you know fighting isn't your thing? 
 Because I don't like violence. 
 Really? You seem to like it in your pictures. 
 Don't be annoying. 
 I want you to see what I do. 
 I want you to meet my brother. 
 Can we go together? 
 I'll pick you up at 6:00. 
 You're corrupting me. 
 Yeah. 
 [Chatter] 
 Hey, Shelb, baby. 
 Aah! 
 Alvey is looking for you. 
 Where is he? 
 Office. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, you looking for me? 
 Yeah. Come in and shut the door. 
 I need you to fill that up. 
 You want me to piss in a cup? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Is that gonna be a problem? 
 I just don't think it's necessary, coach. 
 I do. 
 I put my ass on the line for you, son. 
 I tried to trust you... It didn't work out. 
 Now you got to earn it. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 I'm not going down this road with you again, Ryan. 
 You got too much at stake. It's too f*cking important. 
 So just... Just piss in the cup. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 You want to ride with us to Nate's fight? 
 I can't. I got to go see my dad. 
 Everything okay? 
 [Sniffs] I don't know. 
 Mom called and asked me to go out there, so... 
 You want this today? 
 Before you leave. 
 Easy. 
 Easy. 
 Okay. 
 Good. Shut the door. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm in love. 
 I'm in love, Nathaniel. I f*cking [Smooches] am. 
 You definitely f*cking smell like it. 
 Ah, that's passion. 
 My world is unfolding in beautiful ways. 
 I hear birds I haven't heard. 
 I find beauty in the common crow. 
 Flowers... [Sniffs] 
 Nectar, you know? And oatmeal. 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 f*ck, it just tastes oatier. 
 And she's smart. 
 She knows about art and photography. 
 And she can't get enough of me. 
 Yeah. 
 The s*x, you ask? 
 Oh, it's... Holy f*ck. 
 I mean, I'm seeing angles I haven't seen before. 
 And I'm not just talking position. 
 I'm seeing whole new f*cking doors opening up right now. 
 Pheromones and vibrations... 
 I'm tapping into something f*cking deeper here, you understand? 
 Jay, Jay... I got to keep some of this down. 
 Okay? 
 She's coming to the fight tonight. 
 Very excited about you guys meeting. 
 Yeah. Listen to me. 
 I know you don't like to talk about it, but I want you to know that I love you, and that you're gonna murder this m*therf*cker tonight. 
 [Sniffs] 
 So, what do you need from me right now? 
 And how can I help you? 
 I'm all set. 
 Okay. 
 Lisa and I are gonna go meet Garo, and then I'm gonna meet you at the f*cking gym. 
 Did he get you a fight? 
 He f*cking better. 
 Hey, Jay? 
 Yeah? 
 Mom's inside. 
 She's been crying. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I didn't think you'd be home. 
 Yeah, I-i got to get right back out. 
 But Nate said that you were upset. 
 Your dad and I signed the divorce papers today. 
 Did something happen? 
 Yeah, Jay. We got a divorce. 
 [Sighs] 
 I want to go to Nate's fight tonight. 
 I thought that you had work. 
 [Chuckles] I'll call in sick. 
 I want to be with you guys. 
 Unless you don't want me to? 
 I didn't say that. 
 Well, what's wrong? 
 There's nothing wrong. 
 I didn't say anything was wrong. 
 I just... [Breathes deeply] 
 You know, I was picking up Laura tonight. 
 [Singsong voice] Oh. 
 Well, I'll take a cab. 
 You're not gonna take a cab. We will ride together. 
 How are we all gonna fit? 
 We're gonna squeeze in. 
 Okay? 
 Be ready by 6:00. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Jay? 
 Yeah. 
 How much does she know about me? 
 She knows that you are a very important person in my life, and that I love you very much. 
 You hear me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. 
 6:00. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hi, it's Laura. Leave a message and I'll call you back. 
 Uh, hey, it's me. Give me a call. 
 There's been a slight change of plans about tonight, so, call me. 
 Alvey : Nice and easy. Double, double. 
 Yeah. 
 Just break a sweat, all right? 
 Just breaking a sweat. Come on. 
 Come on. Oh! 
 I'm gonna hit you back. 
 I ain't that old, Sonny boy. 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, look at the tiger. 
 Lay down, lay down. 
 Okay. How's this hamstring? 
 That's good. 
 Aw, you look good, man. 
 You look better than I've ever seen you look. 
 No sh1tting. You worked hard. 
 You're fast. You're explosive. 
 Your f*cking head's in the right place. 
 It's gonna feel like you're shot out of a Cannon. 
 Trust me. I got you. 
 You got to control that. 
 I'm gonna fight my fight. 
 You're gonna fight your fight. 
 You're gonna breathe. Your pace. 
 The whole thing... You know it. 
 I'm just worried about that food after the fight. 
 I'm f*cking starving. 
 Yeah. 
 We doing Italian still? 
 No. 
 Shelby f*cked the reservation up, so Lisa bought a bunch of steaks. 
 We'll have it at my house. 
 All right. 
 Invite your little girlfriend. 
 [Scoffs, sighs] 
 What's the matter? 
 Yeah, I don't know. She's... 
 What happened? 
 Well, she's pissed off about something. 
 What did you do? 
 I didn't do sh1t. 
 What did you do? 
 Training, you know. She doesn't f*cking get it. 
 Ah, they never make it through training camp. 
 None of them. Not one of them. 
 [Groans] 
 Don't bother with girls. They're no good for you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Anyway, what's your mind on? 
 Taking the guy out in front of me. 
 You know where it's at? Your mind's on winning, son! 
 Get up. Turn around. 
 Loose. Keep these loose, loose, loose, loose. 
 I can't believe you didn't give me Nate's first fight back. 
 You didn't have a spot for him. 
 I was working on it. 
 Really? 
 'Cause it kind of seemed like you were slow-playing us to see if he was healthy. 
 Is that what you think? 
 Yeah. I do. 
 Also, I heard about the Ryan deal. 
 Six fights at a frozen rate. That is f*cking extortion. 
 Now, hold on. 
 We all got a little dirty on that one. 
 [Scoffs] It's for the best. 
 [Chuckling] Right. Okay. 
 Whatever you say. 
 Hey, let's not fight. 
 How are you? How is the baby? 
 [Door opens] 
 [Jay sighs] 
 There he is. 
 Man of the hour. 
 Hey, Garo. How are you? 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 [Sighing] 
 Who wants to start? 
 Before we begin, I would like to reiterate my sincere and most humble apologies for any role that I might have played in the skirmish the other night. 
 Well, it was more than just a skirmish. 
 It was embarrassing. 
 You make us look like barbarians. 
 Let's move on. 
 Obviously, we have a problem here. 
 Jay's fights keep falling apart. 
 It's costing us money. I know it's costing you money. 
 I agree. It's not good. It's not good at all. 
 But  I may have a solution. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Excuse me. I have to take this. 
 Jay. 
 You guys continue doing what you do. 
 I'm the talent, you know? 
 I probably shouldn't be hearing this sh1t anyways. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hello? 
 Laura : You are so f*cking hot. 
 What? 
 I'm looking at pictures from the shoot this morning. 
 Oh, yeah? I look good? 
 Well, I haven't gotten dressed yet, if that tells you anything. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes, it does. What are you doing? 
 I'm calling you back. 
 Um, yeah. Flag on the play. 
 Is it possible to meet there? 
 I thought you were picking me up. 
 Yeah, I was planning to, but my mom wants to come, and she doesn't have a car, so unless you want to squeeze three in a cab, you know... 
 I don't mind. 
 I-I want to meet her. 
 You're sure? 
 Yeah, positive. 
 Yeah, no problem. I will pick you up. 
 Hey. 
 I want you here  right  now. 
 I know. Me too. 
 Well, where are you? 
 I'm talking to some promoter, so I should probably get back. 
 Once again, I have to take care of myself. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Forgive me. 
 Well... 
 What did I miss? 
 You missed me having an amazing idea. 
 May I? 
 Go right ahead. 
 What do you value the most in this world, Jay? 
 Money, respect, women, glory? 
 All that sh1t. 
 Garo : Yeah. 
 These things I just named, my friend, these are the spoils of a champion. 
 He wants you to fight Ryan. 
 Think about it. 
 Ryan Wheeler... 
 Jay Kulina. 
 One has blond hair, the other has brown hair. 
 Friends, rivals... 
 Enemies? 
 Perhaps? 
 Either way, I'd buy a ticket for that. 
 Okay, we'll talk about it. 
 I am intrigued. 
 Is that a yes? 
 Lisa handles all my logistics, but I am  very,  very taken by this idea. 
 You... you, sir... 
 You're an impresario. 
 Lisa : We'll get back to you, Garo. 
 I like that. I like your f*cking style. 
 Okay, but don't f*ck me around. 
 I have to move on something, you know... 
 At least something for Wheeler after that sh1t show he pulled last time. 
 Jay : What do you think? 
 It's interesting. It's definitely good for Garo. 
 I don't know if it's good for you. 
 It's a title fight, Lisa. How is it not good? 
 You're just building momentum. What if you lose? 
 Yeah, what if I win? 
 That's the real problem, though, isn't it, huh? 
 'Cause it f*cks with your and Alvey's plan with Ryan. 
 I don't have a plan for Ryan. 
 Lisa... 
 Are you managing me... 
 [Sighing] Oh, god. 
 Or are you managing Alvey's business? 
 You. 
 But it's complicated, and don't act like you can't understand that. 
 I appreciate the complications. 
 I do. 
 But I want this fight. 
 However you have to work that out with Alvey, that's what I want. 
 Yes, ma'am! 
 I want this fight! 
 Jamal, Jamal, there's no way. 
 My son is gonna take me to the emergency room. 
 That's how bad I feel right now. 
 Yes. 
 Well, yeah. 
 I called Madison. She didn't pick up. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Bye. 
 
 
 
 Yo. 
 [Headphone music plays] 
 Yo! 
 Yo. 
 Yo. 
 Yo. 
 How you feeling? 
 The next person that asks me that, I'm gonna rip their f*cking head off. 
 Copy that. 
 What did Garo say? 
 Um... 
 Well, things... 
 Are afoot, Nathaniel. 
 Indeed they are. 
 What does that mean? 
 Well, things... are afoot. 
 I can't say much more than that. 
 Nate... 
 [Liquid pours] 
 I'm gonna leave you here. [Sniffs] 
 But, um, hey... 
 Mom wants to come tonight. 
 Isn't she working? 
 I guess not. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh! Wheeler! 
 Wheeler, Wheeler! 
 Look at you prancing like an elk. 
 [Sighs] 
 What? 
 What is that? Piss? 
 Yeah. It's still warm. You want a sip? 
 Is Alvey making you do that? 
 Yeah, I guess I can't be trusted. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 The f*ck are  you  looking at? 
 Nothing. 
 Avert your eyes, young man. 
 What the f*ck? 
 You f*cking didn't. 
 Let me put my piss down. 
 f*cking whore. 
 Garo's a promoter. That's his job. 
 I mean, it is a good fight. 
 Aw, come on. 
 I can't have my guys fight each other. 
 It's a goddamn soap opera. 
 Wait, you think Jay can win? 
 [Sighs] Maybe. 
 Or Ryan just f*cking annihilates him. 
 Either way, we lose one of our top fighters. 
 We can't afford that right now. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 You got to get Jay to back off of this thing. 
 Oh, yeah. Or what? 
 Or he's gonna trade to someone else. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Don't even put me in that position. 
 Yeah. What am I gonna do? 
 I mean, is he stuck on doing this? 
 Jay wants the fight. 
 It's f*cking Garo. 
 That's what that is. [Sighs] 
 What do  you  think? 
 I think it's everything that you said, but I see Jay's point. This is a title fight. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where do you want this? [Sighs] 
 On my desk. 
 You done for the day? 
 No, I'm still putting some work in. 
 I'm fighting the war on drugs. 
 Jay thinks you don't care about his career. 
 That's how he's gonna take this. 
 All right, let me... Let me... 
 Let me get through this thing with Nate tonight and then I'll talk to Jay, all right? 
 No, I know. Yeah. 
 [Slurps] 
 [Exhales sharply, sniffs, sighs] 
 [Door closes] 
 Mom, we got to go! 
 Mom, it's 6:15. We're gonna be late. 
 We got to go. 
 I'm hurrying. 
 I told you 6:00. You've had all day. 
 If you keep rushing me, it's just gonna take longer. 
 Mom, please. Don't put on all that much. 
 Thank you, Jay. I know how to do my own face. 
 [Chuckling] Geez. This girl's got you on edge. 
 [Sighs] 
 How do I look? 
 You look perfect. Let's go. 
 Please. 
 You're in a bad mood. Maybe you need a drink. 
 I already had one. 
 Maybe I need a drink. 
 I will buy you three when we get there. 
 Mom, you look beautiful. Come on. Let's go. 
 [Mellow rock music plays on car stereo] 
 [Engine and music shut off] 
 [Dog barks in distance, doorbell rings] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Man :  Little long-term damage to mature trees. 
 However, these fires either kill or suppress tree seeds. Hey, dad. Mr. Wheeler : Mute that. Remote's on the table over here to my right. Which will prevent further grass growing. Prior to European settlement, aboriginal land-use practices, including fire, influenced... [TV shuts off] [Sets remote down lightly] You spoke to your mother? Yes. What does she say? She's moving in with aunt Robin. Don't beat her up about this. You hear me? Yes, sir. I'd like to come down here and see you more. I have a-a car now. Sit down. Turn that back up. Or alteration of traditional burning regimes, many savannahs are being replaced by a forest or shrub thickets with little... air. Shelby! Shelby!! [Headphone music plays] Were you yelling for me? What the f*ck you doing? Working out. You're on the clock. Nobody's here. Jesus Christ. Forget it. I just want you to take that piss to the lab on Robertson. Is there, like, a bag or something I could put it in? If you find a bag, then by all means bag it up. Just take it. Whose is it? Just take it before the place closes. Is the Van here? Yeah, Nate and Joey are loading up now. Thanks for telling me. Laura : Hi! Hi. I'm Laura. Christina. Hi, nice to meet you. Oh. [Chuckles] Jay, your mom's gorgeous. Yeah, she sure is. Tight squeeze. [Chuckles] Oh, did you want me to switch? I can sit in the middle. Oh, no, I'm fine. Let's go. Is there a... a middle one? Uh... no, there's not. But I'm gonna drive very safely, okay? Sorry. Oh, sorry. [Laughs] It's okay. [Engine turns over] This reminds me of high school. [Rock music plays on car stereo] [Chatter] See if we can find somewhere better than this. [Bass thumping on headphones] Man : Next when he comes in, sprawl back. So, Jay tells me you're an artist. Oh... No, not really. I studied it for a while. What's your medium? Um, well, it's just little sketches. Pencil, mostly. Ink. Have you ever used charcoal? I'm not really serious about it or anything. [Chuckles lightly] Well, if you ever need supplies, let me know. My friend runs a store in Beverly, and he gives me great deals all the time. Oh. Ladies. Hey. One for you. Thank you. Yeah. Mom. To a, uh... To a great night... And a great fight. And to meeting your mom. Cheers. Cheers. Should be good, huh? Mm. I'm gonna check on Nate, make sure that he's okay. Do you need anything? No. Okay. Mom? Nope. Nope. During the fight, I'm gonna be in my brother's corner. Are you gonna be all right here? Yeah, don't worry about me. [Jay exhales sharply] [Sighs] I'm so nervous. I've never even seen someone get punched in the face. [Chuckles] It's an experience, that's for sure. Well, I'm sure you're used to it by now. Not really. But that's what  this  is for. [Both chuckle] Hey. Man : There you go. There you go. Feels like a prison shithouse back there. Joe's finding us someplace else. You talk to Lisa? I did. I want this fight. I know. I know. I want it. Can we talk later? I found a space down the hall. Do you want me to get him warmed up? No, just take the bags. I'll grab him. Man : That's it. Nice. Let's go 1-2. Man #2 :  Were home to the most advanced civilizations of south America. The Inca empire was the last of many to... Ryan. In Peru. Ryan, wake up. What? What's... what's wrong? I sh1t myself. Oh. I'm gonna need you to wash me up and clean my bag. Okay. You got to get me in the harness first. I don't see... The harness. Yeah. Does she... Does the... [Laughing] I'm... I'm kidding. [Laughs] Oh, sh1t, your face! [Laughing] [Sighs] If you ever start to resent your mother, remember that moment. [Chuckles] Mom said you wanted me to come to see you. I did. [TV chatter] Turn that off, will you? [TV shuts off] The last time we talked, I wasn't fair to you. I was angry, and I took the opportunity to punish you. For that, I'm sorry. I understand if this is too much to come here. I mean, I don't expect it. I'd like to, if that's okay. Well... Be warned, I don't do much but sit here. And I sure as hell don't need to be entertained or have my goddamn spirits lifted. Good to know. I won't try. [Dog barks in distance] Just come by when you can. Hell, I ain't going anywhere. I'd appreciate if you'd call ahead. Yeah. Before you go... Can you put my drops in my eyes? They're on the table here. Sure. You'll need to get a tissue, because it always runs down my goddamn face. Okay. How many? Four in each eye. Okay. Ready? [Chatter, rock music plays] Hi. Hi. Hi. You must be Laura. Lisa? Hi. How are you? Yeah. Nice to meet you. Hey. Hi. [Rap music playing] So, Laura, is this your first fight? Yeah. But Christina's been talking me through it. Oh, don't listen to me. I already feel like I'm gonna throw up. [Chuckles] Where's Jay? He went back to be with Nate. How do you two know each other? Through Alvey. He put babies in both of us. [Christina laughs] Ring announcer : And now, ladies and gentlemen... Do it. Come on. Nate Kulina! [Rock music blares, cheers and applause] [Cheers and applause] [Music continues] [Cheers and applause] [Music continues] [Cheers and applause] Nice and relaxed. Your own pace. Find your pace. Your own pace. Come on, Nate! You ready? Fight! [Bell dings] You set the pace, Nate! Don't stand in front... Side to side! Side to side! Side to side! [Cheering] Jay : Watch his toe! Head position! Head position! [Cheers and applause] Yes! Yeah, that's it! [Indistinct shouting] Man : Yeah, baby! [Indistinct shouting] Whoo! Hips, hips! [Shouting continues] Loose, loose! [Cheers and applause] Keep fighting! Stop this f*cking fight! Keep fighting. He's in position. Finish it! Finish it! What are you doing?! Finish him! f*cking bombs! Drop 'em! God damn it! [Bell dings] Referee : Time! What the f*ck are you doing?! Call this fight! Jay : There ain't no call, bro. There ain't f*cking no call, ref. What are you doing? Sit down. Relax. You never f*cking stop fighting. You never f*cking stop fighting until that ref pulls you up. You hear me? f*cking answers to you. I just want you to do the same thing. Great jabs. Move in, take him down. Finish him, okay? Don't worry about the ref. All right? Let's go. Let's do it. Breathe, relax, have fun. Fight! [Bell dings] Come on, Nate! [Cheers and applause] [Muffled] f*ck yeah! [No audio] [Muffled, indistinct shouting] [Muffled] Watch out. You okay? Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Appreciate it. You got a concussion. We got to watch it. I should have finished him. You got caught. It happens. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on, you come back to my house. I think I'd rather go back to mine if that's cool. Yeah. Okay, I'll have Jay keep an eye on you. Hey, come here. Let me see this. Oh, yeah. That's a beauty, huh? I know it feels like sh1t, son. I do. But it's just one loss. One. We learn from it. We move on. That's it. Right? Yeah. Look at me. I'm proud of you. Always. It's okay. I love you. You too. [Claps Nate's back] Sorry. [Thud] He was doing so good, and the other guy just got one lucky shot. Yeah, I know, sometimes that's all it takes. Is he all right? He will be, yeah. I got to take him home, though, so... Yeah, I'll call an Uber. I'm sorry about that. Do not apologize. I mean, how do you even handle that? What do you... What do you say to him? You say "I love you" and you move on. There's nothing else to do. He's just got to get over it, you know? Well... Thanks for bringing me. Thank you for coming. I really appreciate you. Um, let me walk you out. Lisa : We're never gonna eat all this food. I'll take it to the gym. The animals will eat it. [Laughs] What a f*cking night, huh? [Sighs] He did everything right. Everything. He just couldn't finish. That's what I'm worried about with this kid... He's a f*cking fighter that doesn't like to hurt people. Let me make you some food. No, I'm... I'm... Thank you. We signed the papers today, me and Christina. Only took about six months, but it's done. That's  why she came tonight. She say anything? No. But she was kind of actually nice. She was worried about Nate, though. Yeah. [Sighs] Well, what do you think? About what? Should we get married? [Laughs] Okay. On that note, I'm gonna go to bed. Come here. [Sets glass down] Don't stay up too late, okay? [Sighs]
