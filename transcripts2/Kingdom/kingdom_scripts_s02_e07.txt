 Chapas, you piece of sh1t. Are you out? 
 f*ck. Call me, man. Call me. 
 [Sighs] 
 f*ck. 
 Mom, what are you doing? 
 I'm making myself breakfast. 
 You cannot make me smell bacon. 
 [Sighs] Give me a break. 
 You give me a break. 
 I'm f*cking starving, and that's the number-one f*cking smell. 
 Yeah, well, I can eat what I want, Jay. 
 Not all of us are anorexic. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 I'm good. I'm good. 
 Yeah, I don't even like bacon. 
 f*ck bacon. 
 I like water. 
 I'm gonna go to the gym. I'll be back later. 
 I'll be home late. 
 You doing a double? 
 As usual. 
 If you want me to talk to Jamal about your schedule, let me know. 
 I can handle it. 
 Thank you. 
 Do me a favor. Keep this between us, okay? 
 I don't want the guys knowing. 
 Why, are you embarrassed? 
 Yes. 
 Good. Me, too. 
 Believe it or not, Chapas was a lot more f*cked up than I was. 
 Oh. 
 That makes sense. 
 What were you guys even doing, anyway? 
 His friends had a card game. 
 How'd you do? 
 I broke even. 
 Guess that's better than losing, huh? 
 How many times do we drive drunk? 
 Every time we go out? 
 Could've happened one of a million times. 
 Could've happened to you. 
 No, it couldn't. 
 Okay. 
 Bad guy. 
 See you in a couple. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Excuse me? 
 Excuse me. 
 Are you trying to leave without saying goodbye to your big brother and mentor? 
 You slept late. 
 I did, indeed. It's what keeps me young. 
 I'm sorry I'm not gonna be there. 
 But you know I got to keep clean. 
 And a three-hour car ride with Alvey, man... 
 Will drive a man to f*cking eat. 
 It's all good. 
 You look like a ferret. 
 I feel like a whupped dog. 
 Listen, I'm sorry about Laura. 
 Easy come, easy go. 
 Next one up. 
 Kill it. 
 Call me the moment his head hits the canvas. 
 I've got all your stuff. 
 Great. You have I.V. bags? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, kill this guy. 
 Oh, Fresno in the house. 
 There you go. 
 Show this man he should not be f*cking with a professional, right? 
 All right. 
 What am I doing today? 
 Joe Daddy's got the game plan. 
 All you got to do is work hard. 
 All right, let's go, Keith. 
 Keith : Good luck, brother. 
 Keith. 
 Go see Ryan. 
 You know he murdered someone. 
 Yeah. 
 No, I don't understand. 
 I have an appointment with Dr. Bennett day after tomorrow. 
 sh1t. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Okay, w... what about today? 
 I don't even know him. 
 Okay, so tomorrow at 4:00 with some guy I've never met. 
 Sounds great. 
 Hey. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Juan said you needed me? 
 How are things with your dad? 
 He's all set. 
 The nurse is bringing him up tomorrow. 
 Good. 
 I'm gonna get you a list of questions. 
 I don't want that. 
 Well, it'll be easier. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 No, I want this to be honest. 
 Just not... no bullshit. 
 Okay, well, you know what this interview's about, right? 
 Yeah. 
 It's got to seem like you and your dad are getting along, that he's forgiven you. 
 That's what the sponsors want to see. 
 You think my dad's gonna do scripted answers? 
 Well, do you know what he's gonna say? 
 No, no, I don't, but, you know, things have been better with us. 
 I was gonna tell you that I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, but now I'm concerned. 
 Where are you gonna be? 
 A doctor's appointment. 
 Maybe we should push the interview. 
 No, it's a one-shot deal with my dad. 
 Let's, um... 
 Let's just do it. 
 It's... gonna be fine, honestly. 
 It's... don't even worry about it.

 Shelby? 
 Shelby. 
 Shelby : What? 
 Um, why do we have these f*cking scales from the '70s, huh? 
 I... I don't know. 
 It's f*cking inaccurate. 
 What the f*ck? 
 No, it's not. I weighed myself yesterday. 
 It needs to be recalibrated, okay? 
 No, it doesn't. 
 Can you call somebody, please, Shelby, and just have them f*cking recalibrate it? 
 I don't know why you're fighting me on this right now. 
 Because it doesn't need to be recalibrated. 
 10-pound weight weighs exactly 10 pounds. 
 Just weigh more than you thought you did?

 Hi. 
 Hi. Checking in? 
 Yeah, it should be under Kulina. 
 "K." 
 There it is. I have you in a standard room. 
 Two queen-sized beds for one night. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Just need a picture I.D. 
 Okay. I have this. 
 Picture I.D. 
 Sweetheart, you think I'm trying to con my way into this... lovely establishment? 
 Does he have an I.D.? 
 Son, do you have an I.D.? 
 Yeah. 
 What happened to your license? 
 I lost it. 
 How many keys would you like? 
 Two, please. 
 Look at you. 
 Feeding like an animal. 
 Stuffing your gullet and blowing it out your ass. 
 How many sh1ts a day do you take, Mac? 
 Well, Jay, that depends on the day. 
 It is astonishing how much time you waste on food, figuring what you want to eat, where you're going to get it, going to get it, finding a place to eat it, cramming it down, then laying around like a fattened hog, too lethargic to be any kind of productive citizen. 
 Want a bite? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Do you have any idea how much extra time I have by not worrying about food? 
 I mean, I could learn a second language. 
 I would love to speak Spanish. 
 Nobody would f*cking see it coming. 
 Juan and all those f*cking guys talking sh1t about me, I'd be like, "Spanish, Spanish, Spanish." 
 They'd be like, "oh, f*ck." Be like a f*cking superpower. 
 Take that burrito outside right now. 
 No. 
 Hey! Get out of here! 
 Take it out. 
 Never. 
 You're eating your life away. 
 It's hard to watch. 
 I'm glad you got out of that f*cking burger joint. 
 You're better than that. 
 It didn't suit me. 
 So, how have you been, Terry? 
 Good. Busy. 
 I've been doing these webcams. 
 Hey, hold on. Don't look. 
 Hey, girl, your f*cking dog, it's sh1tting everywhere. 
 Clean it up, or I'll put that mutt to sleep. 
 Oh, Jesus, I'm only joking. 
 For Christ's sake... I'm jo... it's a joke. 
 Just, like, pick up after it, okay? 
 Go on. 
 Jesus. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Can't take a joke.

 I get these new girls in every week. 
 It's legal, too, if you want in. 
 I'm not a kid anymore. Nobody wants to look at me. 
 Ah, people like everything. 
 You could be, like, the filthy stepmom. 
 [Both laugh] 
 I don't know, something like that. 
 I don't know. Jesus Christ. I'm telling you, there is no end to the f*cking appetite out there. 
 So... 
 What do you need? 
 A couple grams. 
 It's not a favor. 
 I have cash.

 What's happening, Fresno? How you doing today? 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Yeah, all right! 
 We have an incredible main-event card tomorrow night starting at 1:55. 
 Let's get to the weigh-in. 
 Give it up for our first guy... Nate Kulina. 
 [Crowd jeering] 
 All right. 
 Looking like... 
 154.5. 
 [Scattered applause] 
 Now give it up for Tony Vargas! 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 They love you, Tony, at 161! 
 161? 
 Bro, what the f*ck is that? 
 Get the f*ck out of here. What the f*ck is that? 
 Don't put your f*cking hands on me again. 
 It's a little over. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 It'll be all right. 
 You set my f*cking guy up, m*therf*cker? 
 You set my guy up? 
 It's fine! 
 You want to f*cking play dirty? 
 I'm gonna show you how to f*cking play dirty. 
 It's fine. 
 I'm gonna f*cking show you...

 f*ck yeah! 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Ohh.

 [Door opens] 
 I don't feel right about this. 
 Hey, I'm serious. 
 Don't be coming around here every day. 
 You were doing so well. 
 I won't. 
 Be careful out there. 
 [Smooches] 
 Lisa : How bad is it? 
 Well, as an investment, it's actually pretty smart. 
 I mean, the numbers are looking good, and there's a demographic inevitability at play here. 
 We're all getting old. We got to live somewhere. 
 I mean, maybe he gets 6% return, which is not bad. 
 But the issue is he did not consult you. 
 Yeah, well, it's his money. 
 Well, you are having his child, Lisa. 
 Yeah. 
 I hate seeing you like this. You're not happy. 
 You should be enjoying yourself. You're having a baby. 
 I'm trying. 
 I feel like sh1t, I look like sh1t, and I'm completely detached from this. 
 Lisa. 
 No, I know. I'm sorry. 
 I want to want this, and I don't. 
 I feel like a selfish bitch because I'm not wrapped up in this miracle, but I'm not. 
 Well, you will be. 
 I don't think so. 
 No, you're being dramatic. 
 Look, the feelings you're having are completely natural. 
 I mean, your whole identity's gotten flipped around on you. 
 I mean, it's hard to be selfless when you spend your whole life worrying about yourself, and then suddenly, you're responsible for a little human life that's totally at your mercy. 
 I mean, that's scary sh1t, especially when you're doing it alone. 
 And where is he tonight? 
 He's in Fresno with Nate. 
 Oh. 
 He's not necessary, you know. 
 You'll always be taken care of. 
 I don't want to be taken care of. 
 Come up to San Francisco. 
 Oh, my God, Dad. 
 We'll put you in the Point Reyes house. 
 It's quiet. 
 You got the... the ocean and the seals. 
 You can have your baby there. 
 Be with your family. 
 Your brothers miss you. We all do. 
 I hate thinking of you down here. 
 It's toxic and violent. 
 Why do you keep this up? 
 Why is it so hard for you to ask me for help? 
 I don't want to owe you anything. 
 Look, I'm not trying to buy a seat at the table. 
 It's your life. 
 But it doesn't have to be so hard, honey. 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't know what I'm doing. 
 You'll find your way. 
 You know, I've given up trying to turn you into whoever the hell I thought you're supposed to be. 
 I admire the woman you are. 
 You took a hard road, and you didn't blink. 
 You and I are the most alike out of all of us. 
 Your brothers are soft. They fall apart. 
 But you... you don't break. 
 But you will if you don't start taking care of yourself. 
 You want to go downstairs and get some real food? 
 Nate : I'm fine. 
 I don't even know why you bothered cutting weight for this sh1t. 
 The fight's 155. I'm gonna weigh 155. 
 Well, that's because you're a professional. 
 These other people aren't. 
 Okay, can we not do this right now? 
 I'm just saying. 
 I'm gonna go get something to eat. 
 Go ahead. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 Mmm. 
 How was work? 
 It was fine. 
 What are you doing? 
 Having dinner.

 I cut your hair crooked. 
 Do you want me to fix it? 
 Oh, we'll do it before the fight.

 He's way over. 
 That was unprofessional. I was pissed off, too, man. 
 Guys like you... 
 It's f*cking guys like you that set this sport back with these f*cking ghetto bullshit cock-fights, man.

 You f*cking turn 'em out like a pimp. 
 That's not fair, man. I pay on time. 
 A f*cking jackal. That's what you are, a jackal. 
 Why am I a jackal? 
 Why? Because you know how these kids live. 
 They'll jump over a f*cking dollar to get to a dime because they can't see down the f*cking road. 
 They're desperate. 
 You feed on them, you f*cking parasite. 
 Alvey, I have so much respect for you. 
 You think I give a f*ck if you respect me? 
 If you got to know me, you would understand that I'm one of the good guys. 
 All my best friends are fighters, all right?

 Growing up, all through high school, he'd just outwork everybody. 
 ♪ Pull the trigger with your tongue ♪ 
 He'd wear those boys out, move up an age group, wear them out, too. 
 I'd say it was his freshman year in high school it started to become clear that this was a path for Ryan. 
 You know, scholarships, so forth. 
 Wrestling. 
 We didn't know about MMA at the time. 
 ♪ You can never break the silence ♪ 
 He was a very polite boy. Quiet. 
 The aggression would always take people by surprise. 
 And I preached that. 
 "Don't talk. Just do it. 
 And don't grandstand." 
 But I understand this is entertainment. 
 There's a certain amount of showmanship goes with that. 
 That's not who he is... 
 No, I don't think Ryan's changed. 
 No, I think he's still the same boy, the same man. 
 I've always looked up to my dad, the way he carries himself, the way... the way other people responded to him... 
 The respect. 
 He... he definitely held me accountable. 
 Getting by is not an option if you can be exceptional. 
 Nothing unusual for me to yank his ass out of a tournament if he wasn't wrestling up to his potential.

 Does it haunt you? 
 What do you mean? 
 You know, do you, like... does it keep you up at night? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Because Michael was a dickhead. 
 But on the other hand, I was used to him. 
 You know what that's like when you lose a shirt or some shoes and... 
 Even if you hated them, even if you never really wore them, it's still kind of sad because they're part of you. 
 If I could do it all over again, I would still stab Michael to death.

 No, man. With your hair. 
 What are we doing? How do we want it to look? 
 I like your hair. 
 Yeah? Well, I'm sorry, killer. 
 This is my look. You need your own look. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It wouldn't have looked good on my face, anyway. 
 What do you think? 
 I think it looks fine the way he is. 
 Are you okay? 
 I didn't sleep well last night. 
 I got an idea. 
 But before I do it, are you attached to anything? 
 What do you mean? 
 You know, in your appearance. 
 Oh, looks-wise, I am your canvas. 
 Carte blanche.

 Dad, thanks for today. 
 I hope it helps. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I can show it to you when they... when they put it all together. 
 It's for you, not for me. 
 Well... 
 If the sponsors do come through, I'll have some more money and... 
 So if there's anything that you've been wanting that could make you more comfortable or... 
 There's nothing. 
 Ryan, I want you to understand something. 
 I meant every word I said today. 
 And I didn't do this for the sponsors. 
 I did it because I can't stand to see you in pain anymore. 
 You understand? 
 You've suffered enough... too much. 
 I love you, son. 
 And I'm proud of you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, um... 
 I'll be down there soon, okay? 
 I hope you will. I'm gonna need your help. 
 Right now give me a push, will you? 
 I'm exhausted. 
 Yes, sir. 
 All right, gentlemen, we've gone over the rules. 
 I want a good, clean, fair fight.

 Cheating m*therf*cker!

 Lisa : How'd it go? 
 Uh, he lost. 
 I had to stop the fight. It was bad. 
 What happened? 
 He didn't fight his fight, you know? 
 He got dragged in. He got the sh1t beat out of him. 
 He's in the hospital now. 
 They're gonna keep him overnight. 
 Jesus Christ. Is he okay? 
 I mean, he's talking. He knows where he is. 
 He's f*cking pissed at me. 
 Well, he can't fight for a while, so maybe this'll be his wake-up call. 
 You know, I'm thinking he... he maybe shouldn't fight at all. 
 That's two... two losses two bad losses in a row. 
 I don't know what I'm gonna tell this kid. 
 Tell him the truth... he's gonna get hurt. 
 Yeah. 
 Anyway... 
 I'm sorry about this D.U.I. thing. 
 It was so stupid. 
 I'll see you in the morning, okay? 
 I won't be here. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm going to my dad's condo. 
 I'm gonna stay there for a while. 
 Okay, Lisa. I'll talk to you later. 
 Chapas : Hi, you've reached Sean Chapas at Rancho Vista Group. 
 f*ck. c**t.
