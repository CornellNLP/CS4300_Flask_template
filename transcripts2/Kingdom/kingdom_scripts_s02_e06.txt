 [Footsteps] 
 [Rattling, footsteps continue] 
 [Dog barking] 
 f*ck. 
 I have a knife! 
 Get back! I have a f*cking knife! 
 I'll f*ck you up! 
 Get the f*ck away from the car! 
 Get the f*ck away from me! 
 I have a f*cking knife! 
 Aah! [Gasping] 
 [Grunting] 
 Aah! 
 [Both grunting] 
 Get the f*ck away! 
 Let's go! Let's go! 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 f*ck. 
 f*ck. 
 [Blade scrapes] 
 f*ck. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Birds chirping]

 [Ringing] 
 Laura : You're up early. 
 I'm, uh... I'm going to training. 
 You're so good. 
 Um, what are you up to? 
 I'm in bed, being lazy. 
 What time is it? 
 6:45. 
 How was your night? 
 Sorry I didn't call you. 
 I-I passed out at like 10:00, dead to the world. 
 Well, I'm glad you got some rest. You know, you're cute when you sleep. 
 [Chuckles] Thanks. 
 I actually think I'm gonna go back to sleep now. 
 I'll call you when I wake up? 
 Yes, ma'am. Sleep well. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 [Tires screech, metal bangs] 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 sh1t. 
 [Gearshift clicks] 
 [Door dinging] 
 Hey, man, that was all me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Did I do any damage? 
 No. We're all right. 
 You want to exchange information? 
 Nah, it's no harm, no foul. 
 I'm Jay. 
 Paul. 
 Is there a problem, Jay? 
 Oh, I don't have a problem... 
 Unless you do. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Are you on something? 
 No, sir. 
 I am clear as a bell... 
 Clear as a bell. 
 Watch where you're going. 
 Maybe we should exchange information and make this official. 
 Have a nice day. 
 Excuse me. 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Indistinct singing] 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 [Bang on hood] 
 [Door dinging] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Oil sizzling] 
 Yes, sir. 
 You're on the grill today. 
 Oh, no, no. You said I was working the register today. 
 Your drawer was short. 
 By how much? 
 $4. 
 [Laughs] 
 You're gonna give me sh1t about a measly $4? 
 I... I'll give it to you myself. 
 You're on the grill, and you need to empty the grease trap. 
 Whoever closes is supposed to do that. 
 Well, they didn't, so change the grease. 
 Hurry up. We got to open. 
 f*ck. 
 Man :  The little male has his head in the carcass... 
 Ryan : All right. I'm out, dude. 
 See you. 
 The cubs have different characters... 
 What are you gonna do today? 
 This. 
 Their game is always delightful. 
 [Sighs] 
 You been watching a lot of TV, pal. 
 Yeah. That's 'cause [Clears throat] There's a lot of shows that I...  mostly the adult females who do the hunting. As you can see... 
 [remote thuds] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 You can't just sit here all day, man. 
 You're getting depressed. You know, that's not good. 
 I know, but there's nothing to do. 
 I mean, we don't have a pool. There's no puzzles. 
 I'm not even good at the Internet... 
 Why don't you get a job? 
 I'm not the guy that gets jobs, Ryan. 
 I'm usually weeded out during the hiring process. 
 Well... Maybe you can, uh... Maybe you can help me out. 
 How could I do that? 
 Just take care of the stuff I don't have time to do. 
 Oh. 
 Clean this sh1t up. I don't know. 
 So, are you... but are you asking me to be your assistant? 
 Well, let's not... I... Let's not put a title on it. 
 Let's just... 
 Okay, Ryan, I'm not trying to play hardball here. 
 That's not what this is about. 
 But I want to ins... 
 I can't... I'm not gonna pay you, Keith. 
 I know, but I just need to insist on having the title. 
 That way, I will be able to define... 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 The... the parameters of our relationship. 
 Okay. Okay. You're my assistant. 
 [Dog barking] 
 For... Yeah. 
 I accept. [Sighs] 
 All right. Welcome aboard. 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 That was intense. Did you feel that? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 How about Habib? 
 It's a bad matchup. 
 Who else? 
 Dominique Wilder? 
 No. He's on f*cking steroids. Who else? 
 [Sighs] 
 Wilson Aguilar. 
 He won't make weight in a million years. 
 Well, f*ck, man, why don't you have Ryan fight himself? 
 Why you being so f*cking difficult? 
 'Cause you gave me a good f*cking, Garo, and now I'm in your life, so deal with it. 
 Who else? 
 Trevor Derricks. He's a striker. 
 Trevor Derricks. I don't know him. 
 He works out of, uh, South beach now. 
 Knockout power? 
 Eh. 
 [Mockingly] "Eh. Eh." 
 I'll talk to Ryan. 
 And now Jay... how do I make him happy? 
 Give him a title fight? 
 [Chuckles] He's in a new division. He has to work his way up. 
 He wants a title fight. 
 Well, I want to suck my own dick, but, you know, some things in life are just out of reach. 
 You asked, "how do I make him happy?" 
 I'm saying give him a title fight. 
 If I do that, the 10 guys in front of him will go ape-shit. 
 Oh, will you remind me to call Mario Goldsmith at Splitlip? 
 There's a promoter who buried his best fighter's drug test and then extorted a shitty deal from him. 
 Hey, he's ass deep in that, too. 
 Yeah, but he's a coach who's just doing his best to protect his fighter, and you're the shady m*therf*cker who tried to extort him. 
 I mean, you're the bad guy, Garo. 
 "Gar-oh." 
 "Gar-oh." Arr-o, not "gare-oh." 
 How long have I known you f*cking people? 
 Okay, fine. 
 I'll give you your f*cking fight. 
 You two deserve each other. 
 [Indistinct singing] 
 [Brake squeal, tires screech] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 What? 
 You're gonna be cool in there, right? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Couple things... 
 Okay. 
 Do not talk to anybody... Unless they talk to you first. 
 That's fine, but it's like prison rules. 
 Got it? 
 I've been to prison. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Second... don't touch any of the equipment. 
 Do not mess with anybody's sh1t. Don't sit on the bags. 
 And do not, under any circumstances, walk on the mats with your shoes on. 
 Sounds like Japan. 
 You with me, Keith? 
 Yeah, I'm [Sighs] 
 Ryan, yes. 
 [Door closes] 
 Ryan : What's up? 
 Hey. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Hey, you know it wasn't me, right? 
 What? 
 You dropping weight. 
 I didn't even hear about it till afterwards, and Alvey never even asked me if I wanted the f*cking fight. 
 Then... 
 What? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 All right. 
 We're cool. 
 I'm not ducking you. 
 Nobody thinks you are. 
 All right. Stay strong. 
 I would never take money out of your pocket. 
 No sh1t, man. 
 I would bite your f*cking hand off. 
 I don't know. 
 It doesn't make me look too slutty? 
 You look hot, and we are marketing towards men, so I guess you kind of have to lean into it. 
 Yeah, it is a tits-and-ass kind of world. 
 All right, which one do you think should I get? 
 Well, we'll get a couple, and then you can decide. 
 Yeah. You know I can't pay for all this. 
 Yeah. I got it. 
 You sure? 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 I have a feeling you're gonna make the money back. 
 All right. I mean, I'll I'll try some more on. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Keith. 
 I work for Ryan Wheeler now. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Shelby. I work for Alvey. 
 Mm. 
 Okay. 
 These are Ryan Wheeler's clothes, and they need to be washed. 
 Then I guess you better wash them. 
 [Engine rumbling] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 Yo. 
 Hey. 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 How many f*cking cars you got? 
 I'm just fixing this one up, man. She's my baby. 
 You're a douchebag. 
 The douchiest. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Oh, I was looking at this thing in, uh, mar vista... 
 Charter school. 
 How's our thing? 
 Oh. Fully funded, breaking ground. 
 That's good. 
 [Chuckles] Better than good. 
 I've seen it take a hell of a lot longer. Hey, you free tonight? 
 Let me call you. 
 All right. Let me know by 6:00. 
 Answer your phone. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 You look like a dick. 
 Nice helmet. [Laughs] 
 [Grunts] 
 Alicia. 
 Come talk to me. 
 Hi. 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 Keith. Ryan's Keith. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 How are you? 
 Busy. 
 I'm... I'm working for Ryan now. 
 I was hoping I could talk to you about Shelby. 
 Hey, coach. 
 Hey. Come and talk to me. 
 Are you living in your car? 
 Hmm? 
 You're here every day really early. You got a pillow and a blanket in there. 
 I've done it. It ain't safe. 
 Look, I'm just in between places right now. 
 I mean, it's only been a few nights. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 We got a couple of beds here. I'm gonna give you a key... 
 Just until you get on your feet. 
 Okay? 
 Thank you. 
 Stay out of the car. 
 Go to work. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 They asked for no pickles. 
 It wasn't on the ticket. 
 Yes, it was. 
 No. 
 Christina, I checked. It was on the ticket. 
 You missed it. 
 [Liquid pouring] 
 I messed up. I'm sorry. 
 But this keeps happening. 
 You don't pay attention to what you're doing. 
 What do you want me do, slit my wrists? 
 It was an accident. Just chill the f*ck out. 
 Don't talk to me like that. 
 Go away. 
 Guess what. Now you're closing. 
 Oh, no, I'm not. 
 You are if you want this job. 
 [Laughs] I don't want this job. 
 What's that? 
 I don't want this job. 
 This job sucks. 
 And you are a little tyrant who's obsessed with sucking off corporate dick. 
 You're done. Leave. 
 Oh, I am so done. 
 I quit. I quit. 
 Hey, everybody, I quit! 
 Madison, I quit. 
 Now your schedule sucks. Sorry, not sorry. 
 Jamal, this is not the whole world. 
 There is so much else to do, so much. 
 You can't imagine what I can do. 
 I'm eating these, so f*ck you very much. 
 I'll be back for my check. 
 There he is. 
 Mm. 
 How you doing? 
 Good. You? 
 Good. Good. Garo's got a fight for you. 
 Guy named Trevor Derricks he's a kickboxer. 
 What do you think? 
 He's a striker, good power. 
 I think it's a good matchup for you. 
 Yeah. If you think so, I'm cool. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Keep your sh1t together? 
 Yeah. 
 How's things going with your father? 
 [Exhales sharply] Good, actually. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah, it's hard to believe. 
 Like, we're getting along. 
 And, uh, Lisa wants to shoot this, like, video piece with the two of us together to, you know, show people we're getting along, like, help with sponsors. 
 Yeah. That's a good idea. I think it's a really good idea. 
 Um, I'm gonna be with Nate most of the day, unfortunately. 
 I got to train him for this bullshit thing in Fresno, so you're on your own. 
 I'll hit it with Joe. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. Good. This is good. 
 All right. Thanks, coach. 
 Yep. 
 You stay at Laura's house last night? 
 I did. 
 You look like sh1t. 
 [Sighs] Thank you. 
 Alvey : You ready? 
 What are we working on? 
 Well, I got no tape on the guy, but we got to go to the ground, so we'll work takedowns and finishing from the top. 
 You can't take any shots to the head. 
 Can you go talk to him? 
 About what? 
 About this f*cking fight. It's a terrible idea. 
 Fighters fight. 
 Fighters fight? 
 That's your brother, Jay. It's your brother. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Anyway, I told Ryan I can't work with him today 'cause I'm gonna work with Nate. 
 I'm gonna tell you the same thing, okay? We'll hit it tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 Lisa got you a big fight, huh? 
 Yeah. I heard. 
 You happy? 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, a lot of work to be done before I'm happy. 
 Lot of work. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Men whooping] 
 Man : Don't walk away! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 So, what do you think? 
 Eh, it'll do. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Snorts] 
 Hey, maybe you want to go the other way with that, have some Valium or something or get some rest. 
 Do you have some? 
 Side pocket. 
 Little one. 
 Bingo. 
 Nice, Macky Mac. 
 [Sniffs] How much do I owe you? 
 Uh... About $35,000. 
 [Imitates buzzer] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Unh. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Man, I'm bored. Let's call some girls. 
 Not today. 
 Why not? 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm not in the mood, Mac. 
 Pbht. 
 I got a question for you. 
 Shoot. 
 What time... what time do lawyers get off? 
 Uh... that's a pretty general question. 
 Roughly. 
 Roughly? 
 5:00 or 6:00? I don't know. 
 Hey. 
 What are you boys doing? 
 We're just taking a little bit of sun. 
 Aren't you supposed to be at work right now? 
 It was slow. They let me go early. 
 Hi, Mac. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, I don't know if Jay told you, but I'm a big fan of Patty palace. 
 Thanks. 
 No. Thank you. You guys do great work. 
 You wearing sunscreen? You're gonna burst into flames. 
 I'm all covered up. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I lay out with you boys? 
 Absolutely. 
 We're actually... 
 We're just about to go to the gym in a minute, so, uh... 
 Okay. [Sniffs] 
 I'll see you later. 
 Bye, Mac. 
 See you later. 
 ♪ All the way back home ♪ 
♪ I can't see... ♪ 
 Yeah, I mean, look, in my neighborhood, you had to defend yourself, so I grew up fighting. 
 It's just what you did. 
 And I just happened to be good at it. 
 I mean, we all have to be good at something, right? 
 So, how long you been training? 
 A year, year and a half. 
 f*ck. You're new. 
 It's fine. 
 It's  great. 
 Yeah. 
 It's totally fine. 
 We're always looking for fresh fighters. 
 Alvey and I are really excited about her. 
 It doesn't take long to spot talent. 
 So, you got a boyfriend, husband? 
 No. 
 Girlfriend? 
 [Chuckles] No. 
 But you are straight, right? 
 Really? 
 It doesn't matter to me personally, but, yes, it matters. 
 I like men. 
 I just don't have one right now. 
 Good. 
 [Laughs] 
 Good. Stay single. 
 It's better if the meatheads think you're available. 
 Adds to the myth, builds the myth, you know? 
 And whatever you do, don't get pregnant. 
 [Chuckles] Right? 
 Not you. Her. 
 She... you're beautiful, all right? 
 Thank you. 
 Y-you know that you can have everything. 
 Right. 
 Me... I have a kid. 
 I've got nothing against kids. 
 I'm just trying to sell a drink here that appeals to a certain demographic. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. No. We get it. Thank you. 
 Alicia, do you mind giving us a second to talk? 
 Yeah. I'll be at the bar. 
 Okay. 
 It was nice to meet you. 
 It's very nice meeting you. You are a beautiful woman. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Keith, what are you doing, man? Go away. 
 Keith, go, bro. 
 f*ck! 
 Just get up. 
 f*ck! Keith! 
 What the f*ck are you doing, man? 
 Watching your flank. 
 Well, move around, dude. Don't just f*cking stand there. 
 Do something. Circulate. Jesus. 
 Never again. 
 Never again. 
 Alvey : Nice roll. 
 [Sighs] 
 Nice and smooth, man, nice and smooth, no strength, no strength. 
 It's not their move. Nice. 
 Nice. 
 Use your foot. Use your foot. 
 Break the clasp with your foot. 
 Right. Hips, hips, hips, hips, hips! 
 Stop. Stop it. Stop! Stop! Hey! 
 Aah! [Bones crack] 
 He f*cking tapped! 
 Aah! 
 You felt that! Jesus Christ! 
 What the f*ck is that, man? You f*cking felt that. 
 You all right? 
 [Groaning] 
 Get the f*ck out of my cage. Get out. Get out. 
 Get out. Get out! Get out! 
 Breathe. Get some ice! 
 Keep talking to him. 
 Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Get some ice. 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. 
 Where is the ice?! 
 
 
 
 [Locker door closes] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 You broke his f*cking arm. 
 You broke his f*cking arm! You hear me? 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you, dude? 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? Can you hear me? 
 Yes. 
 You know what you did? 
 Can you f*cking hear me? You know what you did? 
 Yes. 
 You know what he does? 
 He works f*cking construction! 
 He picks sh1t up and he puts it down for a f*cking living and that's how he makes his money. 
 That's how he earns. 
 Now he can't f*cking do that 'cause of you. 
 Now he can't pick up his f*cking kids, okay? 
 What's wrong, dude? What the f*ck? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing? Nothing? 
 Are you trying to prove something to me? 
 No? You're not? Well, what the f*ck? 
 I couldn't feel him tap. 
 You didn't feel him tap? 
 He f*cking tapped 20 times! 
 I watched him f*cking tap! 
 You are out of f*cking control! 
 What is going on? 
 f*cking hit me. 
 Hit you? 
 Just f*cking hit me! 
 Hit you?! I'll f*cking kill you! 
 Get out. Get out! 
 Leave it. [Bag thuds] 
 Leave it. Get out of my gym. 
 Take your sorry ass the f*ck out of the gym. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 You f*cking nailed it. 
 He loved you. 
 Good. 
 Yeah. 
 Can I get another one, please, and the check? 
 Bartender : Sure. Here you go. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not gonna have to f*ck him, am I? 
 No. You don't have to f*ck him. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 So... Now what? 
 He wants to see you fight. 
 But I thought he loved me. 
 He does. 
 But he still needs to see you fight. 
 All right, well, you just tell me when then. 
 Mmm. And I don't have any money. 
 I got it. 
 Thanks. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Horn honks] 
 Hey, man. 
 [Horn honks, car door closes] 
 Paul. Hi, man. I'm Jay. 
 From this morning, the accident. 
 What is this? What are you doing here? 
 Dude, I'm Jay. 
 Well, so f*cking what? I'm Paul. That's John. That's Steve. 
 No, no, no, no. I'm Laura's Jay. I'm the one she's been hanging out with. 
 Oh. Jay. 
 Jay. Okay. You're the new guy. 
 Yeah, I'm I'm sorry. She's always got someone. 
 I was hoping you and I could have a conversation. 
 Okay. About what? 
 Number one, this isn't personal between me and you. 
 Laura's a beautiful girl, and I expect that there are gonna be other men, so this isn't about me and you. 
 Hey, listen, man, I get it. 
 Long as you don't piss in my pool, Jay, we're fine. 
 Right. 
 You need to back off her, give her a little space, let her move on. 
 Okay. Move on with who? 
 You? 
 I'm not saying you can't talk to her, Paul. 
 You can talk to her, but events, parties, galas... 
 [chuckles] 
 Those have got to stop, man. 
 You got to take somebody else. 
 Okay, well, should I kick her out of my house? 
 That's between you. 
 What was your name again? 
 J... J... Jay. 
 You know that. 
 Jay. 
 Don't try and diminish me. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 Do you think Laura wants a relationship with you? 
 Yes, I do. 
 You do? 
 Oh, right. You think she's the one, huh? 
 You know, it's early on, but yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Jay, what do you do for a living? 
 I'm a fighter. 
 Ah. Does that pay well? 
 It fluctuates. 
 Okay. I-i only ask this because that woman has an abject fear of poverty, all right? 
 She's got zero relationship with her family, too. 
 I mean, I know this because I just spent two weeks in Montana trying to find them. 
 We found them. Her mom... Her mom lives in the f*cking woods. 
 Her old man nice guy. 
 He's a drunk, but he's a nice guy. 
 Want to know what we did last night? 
 Went to a clipper game. 
 We had a late dinner, and then we came home to my house where she spent four hours bawling her f*cking eyes out on my bed because I didn't want to get married. 
 Man, I barely slept. 
 So there you go. 
 We've had our little conversation. 
 And now if you come near me again, I'm gonna have you arrested. 
 And then I am gonna take your f*cking life apart because, well, that's what I do for a living. 
 Okay? 
 You have a good one, Jay. 
 Keith! 
 I'm in here. 
 Ryan : Keith? 
 I said I'm in here. 
 Of course you're in here. 
 Where's my bag? 
 What a day, Ryan. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 How do you think it went? 
 Typical first day. 
 I mean, there was some good, some bad. 
 Listen, pal, I've, uh... 
 Geez. 
 I've gotten a few complaints about you. 
 Complaints about me? From who? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It's Shelby, right? The girl at the counter... Shelby? 
 Is that from who? 
 It doesn't matter from who. 
 It's Shelby because her and I had a little tussy over your... 
 You can't come in here making enemies. 
 Dial it back, okay? 
 Well, I have a job to do, Ryan. 
 If that's gonna ruffle some feathers... 
 Keith, there's a way that sh1t works here. 
 You can't f*ck it up, and if you do, you're out, man. 
 That's it. 
 I don't want to see that happen to you. 
 I don't, either. 
 I've seen greater men than me get fired on the first day. 
 Okay. 
 Finish up your sandwich, and we got to get out of here. 
 Okay. 
 Those two are for you. 
 Really? 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Crying] 
 You okay? 
 It's just so f*cking stupid. 
 I f*cking hate this sh1t. 
 What? What is it? 
 [Scoffs, sniffles] 
 I mean, this guy's talking about not getting pregnant. 
 And I have a... A 4-year-old son. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 [Sniffs] 
 Where is he? 
 [Sniffles] In Florida. 
 [Sniffles] 
 With his dad's parents. 
 [Sighs] 
 I haven't seen him in two years. 
 [Sniffling] 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 This is so stupid. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know what? Just... 
 Don't tell anybody, okay? 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Footsteps departing] 
 Keith : Like, it's the movie which everybody makes fun of him for, but it's actually really good. 
 It sounds watch it. 
 Off the mats with the shoes on, please. 
 Hey. 
 What's up, Keith? 
 Hi. 
 Oh. Hey, Lisa, you should go talk to Alvey. 
 Why? What's up? 
 sh1t with Nate. 
 So, uh... How'd it go? 
 Good. 
 Yeah, good, I think. 
 Good. Hey, uh, would you load up? 
 And I'll be out in a second. 
 Am I driving? 
 Mm, f*ck no, you're not driving. 
 It's not that far. 
 Please and thank you. 
 [Chuckles] Bye, Keith. 
 Bye. 
 You do look, uh... you do look good in that dress. 
 I know. That's why I wore it. 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 So now you're talking to me. 
 When was I not? 
 Why don't you come by later? 
 Well, Alvey gave me a set of keys, so I'm gonna work out. 
 Insurance will pay for the arm, but what the f*ck is going on with Nate? 
 Oh, I don't know. [Sighs] 
 I don't know. 
 This Fresno thing's a f*cking disaster, I'll tell you that. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 By the way, your fighter's living out of her car. 
 I gave her a key. 
 How was the meeting? 
 They want her. 
 They want to see her fight. 
 I worry about her record. 
 I got an idea. We could do something here. 
 Invite a couple teams down. 
 We call it an in-house sparring session. 
 She gets the pressure of a fight. 
 The sponsors see how she is. 
 If she loses, it's not on her record. 
 That's a good idea. 
 Huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Every once in a while, I bust one out. 
 Every now and then. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Are we doing anything later? 
 No. Why? 
 'Cause Chapas came by. He wants to have dinner. 
 You gave him money. 
 Yeah. Not from here, but yeah. 
 Did you even look at the prospect... 
 No. I looked at the guy who gave you the prospectus. 
 Just say you don't want me to go. 
 Go. 
 I'm tired. I'll see you when you get home. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Pills rattling] 
 [Crunching] 
 What are you taking? 
 Valium. 
 Why? 
 Because I'm hungry. 
 Then eat. 
 I can't. 
 [Sighs] 
 Your brother has been in his room with the door closed for hours. 
 He probably wants to be left alone. 
 Maybe you should knock on his door. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 If he wanted to talk, he wouldn't have the door closed. 
 Could you smoke outside? 
 [Exhales heavily] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 [ Both grunting ] 
 I'm out. 
 Should I change? 
 No, no, you stay here. 
 I can change. 
 Nope. I'll be back later. 
 Oh, gosh. 
 Man. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 You should have got the steak. That's what they're known for. 
 Always get the specialty. 
 That red meat is gonna kill you. 
 Mm. 
 I drink my dinner. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Lisa give you sh1t about coming out? 
 Lisa's pregnant, dude. She gives me sh1t all the time. 
 [Laughs] 
 Love and marriage. 
 Yeah. 
 Lately I make her skin crawl. 
 I'm sorry, buddy. That's rough. 
 I'm used to it. 
 Then why you so f*cking moody? 
 Who's moody? I'm not f*cking moody. 
 Can't a guy have a f*cking drink, shake his day off? 
 Are  you  my wife now? 
 You'd be lucky to have a man like me. 
 I'm amazing. 
 [Chuckling] Yeah. 
 What is that? 
 Jesus. 
 You want half? 
 It's in your mouth. I don't want anything. 
 No? Okay. 
 No. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Soft piano music playing] 
 So, seriously, you okay? 
 Yes. 
 Nate broke some kid's arm today when he was sparring. 
 Guy tapped like 25 times. He kept f*cking going. 
 Well, he's got a fight coming up. Maybe he's jumpy, you know? 
 I-I dislocated a guy's elbow once. 
 I mean, that sh1t happens. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 I don't know. 
 What? 
 All right. 
 I'm gonna do something to cheer you up. 
 [Up-tempo blues music playing] 
 [Pounding on door] 
 Who is it? 
 Ryan : Uh, there was a noise-disturbance call. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Damn. Look at you putting in the extra work. 
 Am I interrupting you? 
 I can take a break. 
 Good. 
 Let's have a drink. 
 [Cellphone dialing] 
 Hey, dad. It's me. 
 Can you call me when you can? 
 I want to ask you a question about something. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 [Rock music playing] 
 Hey. Come on. 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 Let's go. 
 What the f*ck is this? 
 Enough with the questions. You'll see. 
 What did you take me to? 
 Hey. It's Chapas. 
 He's my guest. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Soft music playing] 
 Hey. 
 Sweetheart, how you doing? 
 Two whiskies, neat. 
 What is this place? 
 It's a club. 
 [Laughing] It's a club? 
 Private club. Thank you. 
 [Grunts] Oh, man, what did you get me into? 
 Sit back. Relax. 
 Oh. 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 Excuse me. 
 Okay. You... And you. 
 Alvey, huh? 
 I'm good. 
 Are you sure? 
 Hey. Come on. No, no. Take care of my friend. 
 Take him to the back. 
 I'm good. 
 Hey, you're gonna hurt her feelings. Go ahead. It's on me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Pounding on door] 
 [Sniffs, exhales sharply] 
 [Indistinct speaking] 
 [Dogs barking] 
 [Pounding intensifies] 
 Jay, Jay, someone's banging on the door. 
 Mom, stop. 
 f*ck. 
 Hold on! Hold on a f*cking second! 
 Huh? 
 [Pounding on door] 
 Who is it? 
 Hey. 
 You are such a f*cking asshole! 
 What's going on? 
 Hey, mom, mom, give me a... 
 Give me a f*cking break, please, mom. 
 Please! 
 You hit his f*cking car?! 
 Are you f*cking crazy?! 
 It... it was an accident. 
 No, it wasn't! You went to his work! 
 Because... 
 [Sighs] 
 Because you're lying to me. 
 You're lying. 
 Y-you want to f*cking marry him, he's telling me? 
 What the f*ck are you doing with me? 
 You are ruining my f*cking life, Jay! 
 You are f*cking my life up! 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know, I'm trying to be patient with you. 
 I'm trying to understand all of this. 
 He's kicking me out of the house, Jay. 
 Great. 
 He won't even talk to me. 
 Get the f*ck away from him. Stay here. 
 Stay here. 
 I know how important he is in your life... 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 But you don't have to f*cking owe him sh1t. 
 You don't... 
 I have to take this. 
 It's okay to let yourself be happy. 
 Hi. 
 Not great. 
 [Lighter clatters] 
 [Sighs] 
 Is he up there? 
 What... what did he say? 
 [Sniffling] 
 He was so... 
 Yeah, but... 
 It wasn't my fault. 
 [Exhales sharply, sniffs] 
 Yeah. Me too. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Should I still come up there? 
 Yeah, I do, too. 
 Okay. I love you. You're... 
 You're the best. 
 Okay. I'll see you in a bit. 
 Who was that? 
 That was Paul's sister. 
 Mm. 
 I have to go. 
 Where? Hey. Where? Where you going? 
 Hold on a second. Stop. Where you going? 
 Montecito. 
 Paul's up there with her, and I promised her I-i would go up there. 
 f*ck it. 
 You're staying here. 
 Jay. 
 You're staying here. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Jay, you are an amazing guy, and I love spending time with you... 
 Yeah, but you're scared 'cause this is real, and it scares you. 
 It scares you because you're so used to feeling f*cking dead with him, and dead is easy 'cause nobody asks you to do anything when you're dead. 
 I... 
 hey, hold on a sec. 
 I have been lied to all over the place by f*cking everyone. 
 I know when people are full of sh1t, so look at me. 
 Look at me, and you tell me that this isn't real. 
 Tell me. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 [Voice breaking] It was. 
 It was real. 
 But then it changed. 
 That's what happens. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 I don't think we should talk anymore, okay? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Bye, Jay. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Hard rock music plays] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Both moaning] 
 Whew. 
 Mmm. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop. Stop. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Grunts lightly] 
 [Laughs] 
 You're beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 No phones. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Chapas laughing] 
 [Smooches] 
 Wow. Look at you. 
 [Keys jangling] 
 Here. You drive. I'm toast. 
 I'm not driving. I'm not driving. 
 Oh, you're driving. 
 Huh? I'm... I'm f*cked up, too, man.
