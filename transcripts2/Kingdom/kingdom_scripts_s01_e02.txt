 Alvey : Fighting's a mind-fuck. 
 Fighting hurts. 
 It softens your dick. 
 Unless you're a psychopath, and [Inhales deeply] 
 I got no time for guys like that. [Exhales deeply] Most guys run from fights. 'Cause they don't want the answer to the inevitable question that they whisper to themselves... "Am I one of the weak? Am I one of the strong? Where do I line up in the pecking order of it all?" Fighters... Fighters need that. You know, it lifts them up. It feeds them. It's the truth that they got to have. [Ticking continues] I think that's what's f*cking me up. I think that's, uh... You know, I don't have that anymore in my life. I don't know... I don't even know what questions to ask. I'm starting to feel like I'm a big f*cking joke... Like, uh, I'm just a... I'm a revival act, that everything I've done that's worth a sh1t, it's already happened. Couple weeks ago, Lisa was handing out fliers... promo fliers for the gym. My picture's on it. I look at it. And I say to myself, "f*ck, you should just go limp off into the woods and die already, guy. I mean, party's over, amigo." Dr. Kramer : You talk to Lisa about this kind of thing? She sees it before I do. [Laughs] And what does she say? She likes you. She thinks this is a good idea. You know, she tell... she tells me that... that I should ease up on myself, which I do. I do. I really do. I... but then I get tired. And, uh, I start to feel like sh1t. Is it the sleeping pills aren't working? I'm not taking 'em. Why is that? Because I need another pill like I need a hole in the head, doc. How about the other medications? Are they... they working for you? Uh, yeah. I-I... yeah, I guess so, yeah. Yeah, they're... yeah. You know, I got to cut this short. Are you... are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But, uh... This is good. I-I... you know, you do good work. Thank you. We've been getting somewhere here. [Chuckling] That's some progress, huh? You can do this. I believe in you, Mac. You can do this. Mac : This isn't happening. It is happening. Why, Mac? Come on. Because those things are filthy. Well, then, I'm gonna sterilize it. Look at this. Mac, look. Listen to me... in the civil war, doctors amputated people with f*cking rusty machetes, okay? And then they would seal up the wound with bull semen, and out you go... it saved lives. That absolutely did not happen, buddy. It did not happen, but I'm talking about literally a few centimeters of metal, man. Look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm shutting it down. It's been a lovely evening. Hey, I'm gonna pay you $200. Ha, m*therf*cker, if you had 200 bucks, then you should have paid for your drinks. There you go. Mac... I don't have 200 bucks. I am just asking. I am asking you, please, let me dart you like a rhino. Let me dart you like the white rhino, the majestic white rhino that you are. Please, I need this. I need this. Guys, let's go. Come on. Throw the dart. On three. One... don't count it. I got a neck cramp cramp. Oh, throw the dart, Jay! Throw the dart! Throw the da... I got a neck cramp, Mac! Easy! [Sighs] [Grunts] Okay. Oh, yeah, Mac, well done. Can we leave the bar now? Mac. Goodbye, gentlemen. It's a walk-off, man. [Door closes] Good f*cking morning. Who's picking up Nate today? My dad wants to. You guys are f*cking hilarious. It's not me, man. I'm peace and love. What do the cops say? Oh. All kinds of sh1t. They're getting into it... way into it. They just put together a new task force, so it's a really big f*cking deal for them. It's this and O.J. It's been two weeks. They got nothing? Can't even get these bitches on the phone. But you know what? That's okay. I'll figure it out. Jay. Hey, please. Let the police handle it. Please? Hey. Please? So, I wonder how this steering wheel got bent, Mac. I woke up, and it was like that. [Chortles] All right. Get out of there. [Grunts] Get some sleep. I'll see you at the hospital. [Engine turns over, rock music plays] ♪ Whoa ♪ 
♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ [Dog barks in distance] [P.A. beeps] [Indistinct talking over P.A.] [Indistinct shouting, thudding] Keith. Hey, Keith! Keith! Keith, what the f*ck?! f*cking sh1t! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey! Sto... hey. Oh, man! [Screams, sobs] You see this?! It's my place! Shh. Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my place! This is my stuff. Keith. Keith. My stuff, too. It's my stuff, too. People steal stuff here! You can't even have anything here. Okay, okay. What did they steal? What did they steal? I'll help you find it. Oka... hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey. Hey, what did they steal, man, huh? My... I'll help you find it. What? [Whimpers] My... [Sighs] My... my bear. Bear? Like a toy? [Sobbing] Hey. It's a key chain. I had it in here. It's a bear key chain. Ryan : Okay. And... I know it's funny to you guys, but... Hey, Keith, look at me, man. I'm not laughing. Hey. W-where's the last time you had him? Huh? [Sobbing, breathing heavily] It... it was in here... Like it always is. Great. Okay, so we'll search in here... [Sniffles] Without f*cking everything up. And then we'll expand the perimeter and then... Hey, if somebody stole him, I'm gonna get him back for you. Don't worry. He'll turn up. [Sighs] Okay. All right. Thanks, Ryan. Yeah. Can you help... [Rock music plays] Good. Let me see. You guys are lazy. You're pissing me off. Three and three. Three and three. Come on. [Claps] Let's go. One. Two, move. We move. We keep moving. We don't move, we rot. We die. Always moving. Always moving. No mistakes. The only mistake is to stop moving. You're thinking. You're thinking. Something doesn't work, don't get stuck. Don't stay there. I see you guys get frustrated a little bit because you want the triangle or you want the f*cking armbar. It doesn't matter. You keep moving. 30 seconds. 30 seconds. Come on. Every move has a twin. For every move, there's a countermove. We get stuffed on one move, we go to the twin. Come on, come on, come on! Five seconds! Move it, move it! We get stuffed on that move, we go back to another twin. Like water. Always transition. Good. Good, good, good. Any questions? Smile. I want everybody to smile. This is fun. We're having fun. [Laughs] All right. See you tomorrow. [Applause] [Door opens] Hey. Lisa : Hey. Hatchet list? Yep. It's not that hard to stay off it. Just pay the money per the contract that every single person signed. No Taylor? Taylor... he spends a lot of money on his manicure and pedicures. He spends a lot of money on his tattoos. I'm not asking for a lot of money. I'm just asking for what he owes us. Christophe? This hoodrich m*therf*cker? He just told me he was in Vegas. Nobody wants to pay daddy. f*ck 'em, f*ck 'em, f*ck 'em. Get 'em out of here. Fine. I will. But then you can't go behind my back and tell him he can train. I don't do that. You do that, baby. [Laughs] Babe, I don't do that. You do it. I don't... I would... II don't even like this guy. He smells like a fat rat's ass. All right, listen. Every penny counts. You understand? This is not a joke. [Sighs] Everyone's got to pay to train here. We keep going like this, we're gonna be closed in three, maybe four months. Come on. f*ck. ♪ Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ♪ 
♪ Ah-ah, ah-ah ♪ 
♪ Ah, ah ♪ I need Ryan. That's your business plan? He... he's a diva. You can't hitch a gym to a diva. They suck out all the air. And then they leave you, and you know that. Yeah, well, I don't need harmony. I need a f*cking killer. I need a killer. And I don't see one out there, do you? Look. No. I'm gonna take a shower before we get Nate. Is Jay coming? I don't know, but I'm not waiting for him. Hey, Mac. What's up, bud? Did you ever find that cat? What cat? The one that took a sh1t in your mouth. Sorry. [Siren wailing] Hey! Look at you! My beautiful son held together with duct tape - still handsome. Thanks, brother. Aww. You look great. Thanks for coming, guys. Let's get away from the hospital before we get staph infection. Hey, Lisa. Hey, keep an eye on his, uh, concussion symptoms. If he's in the light... No, I-I spoke to the doctor. Okay. Yeah, hey, listen, uh, come by the gym later and bring the goodie bag. Whatever you need. My man! Alvey : Doc says week, week and a half, you could start physical therapy. That goes as it should, then you could start training inside of six months. That's good. Good? That's... that's f*cking great. I'm getting a lot of calls on you right now. You got a lot of heat. I just got to get you healthy. [Pats leg] Lisa : Nate, you really should come and stay with us. Oh, why don't you do that? We'll cook you good meals. You'll get some rest. I can... I can watch out for you. Do that. Do that. Come... come with us. No, I'm good at my place. But, um, if it's cool, I'll take you up on the meals. No. That's not cool. [Laughter] You are getting better. [Laughs] All right. Let's go. [Dog barking] [Grunts] Careful. Aw, he's fine. [Sighs] [Grunts] [Car door closes] Thanks. [Sighs] You come by the gym later. Everybody wants to see you. Yeah, I-I think I'm gonna do that tomorrow. Just kind of want to chill today. Yeah, you rest up. [Rock music plays in distance] [Grunts] You good? Yeah. Can't keep my boy down. I'll call you in a little while. You get some rest. All right. Thanks. And let me know if you need anything, all right? I will. [Toilet flushes] [Music continues] Hey, Nate. Hey. [Laughs] [Sighs] [Pills rattle] [Gulps] [Rock music plays] [Thudding] Taylor. Taylor, I know you can hear me. Can I see you in my office, please? Taylor : I talked to Alvey. He said it was cool. Yeah, I'm sure he did. Close the door. Have a seat. Look, I can get you back when I can, which, I swear to God, will be soon. Are you working? [Sighs] Look, Taylor, we love you, we love having you here, but this is a business. And if you don't pay, why should anyone else? I mean, if you had a fight coming up, that would be a different story. That's the thing... I can't get cleared because of my eye. It doesn't even bother me. Okay, then you shouldn't be fighting, anyway. You could get hit and lose your sight. [Sighs] Can I finish my workout today? Please? Taylor. Please? Yeah, okay. Fine. But I only want you fighting inanimate objects. And then that's it until you honor your contract. [Telephone ringing] Mark : Mitch wants paper clips now. Last week, it was f*cking staples. Just make up his mind. I hate that f*cking prick. [Sighs] Your urine came back clean. Congratulations. How you getting along at the house? It's fine. Yeah? Hmm. You like your roommate? Yeah, he's not bad. He's...Nice. Good. What about employment? I have chores at the house. Any luck with a real job? Not yet. All right, I'm gonna give you a name. You call this number, tell him I sent you. He could set you up with some work. I've sent a lot of guys down there. You know anything about pest control? Nope. Find the pest. Kill the pest. Now you know pest control. [Laughs] Easy-peasy. Well, keep it up. I'll be dropping by at some point to check up on you. Hey. Can I ask you a question? Sure. When you were training for a fight, you ever wear one of those, uh, sauna suits? Yeah, sometimes for cutting weight. You generate a lot of perspiration in those? Y-you... you sweat a lot? That's the point. Huh. I can imagine. [Sighs] There she is. Hey, buddy. Are you training today? Hopefully. I got a fight in Pomona. Oh. Nice. What's going on with you? How's school? Boring as sh1t, but I'm doing it. Perhaps the lady would like a study buddy? Oh. Thank you, kind sir. Alvey here? He's in the cage with Joe Daddy. What about Lisa? Lunch. But she'll be back soon, so I'd hurry. Thanks, babe. Put your head down. [Rock music plays] ♪ Five, six, seven ♪ Mac : What do you think? What's his record? 8-5. I don't know who he's fought, though. He's a big guy. He moves slow. Yeah, he's got some bad habits. His boxing's terrible. Basically, all you got to do is fake him out a few times. Blast him with a straight right hand. All right. His guard's good. [Chuckles] His guard's okay, man. He doesn't protect his left side, so every time he re-guards, you just move to the left, right? And then you mount him. You ground and pound. He's easy to beat. You better beat this guy, or don't come back to my gym. Thanks, coach. You're welcome. How's your energy? Ah, it's good. It's not great. Maybe we double-dip this sh1t. Let's just stick where we are for now. Too much HGH, you're gonna start looking like a mutant. Oh, I'm gonna look like a mutant, you red-headed f*ck? You're almost extinct. [Chuckles] Hey, uh, would it be all right if I camped here? How long? Just a few weeks. How much you making? Three-hundy. Ooh. I'm gonna get rich. Yeah, man, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it with Lisa. And close that up, bro. That's why she hates you. [Door opens] [Sniffs] Smells of homoerotic relations in here, gentlemen. Whenever you're ready with your boner shots, I'm ready to train. [Knock on door] [Doorknob rattles] Just a second. Lisa : We have a very clear vision for the gym. Our long-term goal is to split the gym in two... one for top-flight, professional athletes trained by Alvey and his coaches, the other open to the public, focused on fitness and membership. We'll brand and franchise all over the country. Paul : [Clears throat] We're not interested in health clubs. Then, I don't know what kind of return you're looking for. Pro-only gyms run a slim margin. My father is very passionate about fighting. He wants to be involved. I have a question. There's a gym on every corner. Why did you approach us? [Sighs] Well, Alvey's an attraction. He's a legend. He's in the canon, as my dad would say, but, uh, we do have reservations, and we are exploring other gyms. I guess our big concern is the current talent level. We have a lot of up-and-comers. Hmm. What about Ryan Wheeler? Ryan is, um, dealing with some personal issues right now. I don't think you should have any expectations of him ever fighting again. I don't want to lie to you or mislead you in any way. It's $20,000. We just... we just want you to know we're serious. [Dogs barking in distance] [Dishes clink] [Sizzling] Hey. You're alive. Welcome home, man. How you doing? Real good. Good. Come sit down. You all right? Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Cool. Yeah, yeah. You want me to put your, uh, leg up here? No, I'm good. Okay. Okay. [Sirens wail in distance] Enjoy that. That is Whole Foods turkey bacon. Um, about the hospital today, I'm sorry. Uh, Alvey and Lisa had it. So... No, don't worry about it, man. It's all good. Okay. [Sniffs] Why don't you grab those utensils... And eat up? Geez. [Sighs] That is some scar, huh? [Sighs, sniffs] Mm. You're a real monster, huh? Boy, look at this thing. Stop. Don't. I'm sorry about that. [Sighs] [Sniffs] So, you want to talk about the guys who jumped you now? Meaning what? You know... what did they look like? What were they saying? Were they talking sh1t? I don't remember. Well, they didn't steal anything, so they must have had a reason to f*ck you up. Jay. I left the gym. I woke up in the hospital. Can't tell you something I don't know. So it'd be really nice if you didn't pelt me with f*cking questions. You're right. I'm sorry. All right. So you want to, um... Maybe have some people over to the house? There's been some girls asking about you, Nate. Want to spend some time with the champ. [Bottle opens] Kind of just want to chill. We can do that. We can chill today. But tomorrow, you're gonna come watch me kick the sh1t out of the old man. 
 
 You guys training again? Yep. Of course, he's being an asshole. He's not getting any f*cking fights, but... You haven't fought in a while, Jay. Yeah, but f*ck that. Release the beast. Let him get paid. Right? Yeah. And then, they just, like, put 20 grand on the table. No, they did not. [Chuckling] They did. Jesus Christ. You got to run. I know. I know. Run. It felt really good to have 20 grand in my hands, though. Yeah. This investor thing's not for us, you know, even if their money's legit. Well... And they get control, and they're in our lives, and we don't need that sh1t. That's not for us. Fine, but we need something. I'm telling you we should give this Ryan thing a go. [Exhales sharply] He's not gonna fight. [Scoffs] You keep saying that. How do you know? I went to see him. He was texting me and... He was saying something about the 12 steps and making amends and apologizing, and there was a whole bunch of other people there... all of these families... and he apologized. Honestly, Alvey, I felt...Awful for him. He doesn't have any family. He doesn't have anybody. [Sighs] He's got us. Alvey, no. I mean, you think I like him texting you? That's... that's gonna stop. But I kind of understand it, you know? I do. I empathize with him. I mean, he's a desperate guy. I-I've been there. Okay, fine. Whatever it is, I don't want him in our life, and I don't want him in our gym. I know, but that's two separate things. No, they're not, Alvey. Yes, it is. Oh, my God. Come on. Look. At least keep an open mind, right? We cut out all the fuck-ups in our lives, there'd be nobody left. Mm. Come on, Jay! Do something! Jay : I'm standing up, pops. Come on, come on, come on, come on! Aah! Come on. Put me down, bitch. Come on. Come on, hips, hips, m*therf*cker! Come on! Hips, man. Hips, hips. Come on. Jesus Christ, you're f*cking weak! Where did you go? Oh! That's all you got? [Both grunting] [Spectators murmuring] [Groans] You f*cking kicked me, man. You kicked me. That's what you do? Get a f*cking cheap shot? [Punches gloves] Come on. Come on. Come on. Throw kicks. Throw kicks. Aah! Ohh! Again? Again? You gonna f*cking kick me? You got no f*cking length. You got no snap in your f*cking punches. Man : Jay, fight back. Get the f*ck... [Grunts] m*therf*cker, you want to kick? You kick me? Only fighters in here, only fighters. [Sighs] There you go. You got blood on my gloves. I want some fights. What did you say? [Sighs] I want some fights. Who's getting you fights? I don't know. Isn't that what you do around here? Yeah, that's what I do. I ain't picking up the phone for you again, man. You're here 'cause your brother wants you here. You know that. Okay. Thanks for looking out, pops. Looking out? I got promoters that still won't call me back because of you. You either don't show up or you don't make weight, or you show up and you're drunk. Yeah, and I win the fight. And it's the fight of the night, and it's a f*cking show. You're a dickhead, and that's dickhead behavior, and you're un-fucking-reliable. That makes me unreliable, and I can't get these guys f*cking fights. They leave my gym. Just stop f*cking thinking about yourself all the time. Why do you want to fight? [Sighs] 'Cause I have the heart of a lion. You need money. I need a fight. Show me some f*cking consistency. Show me some f*cking heart. Do that for me. Okay? Yeah? I'm not done. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tone things down, okay? It's toned down. I want you to tone things down because I want your brother to rest, okay? Yeah. Okay. You talk to the police? No, not lately. 'Cause, you know, they're not answering my phone calls. I'm up their ass. Don't call them. Don't call them. Think they'd do their f*cking job. Don't call them, Jay. All right. All right? They'll call me when they know something. Throw that away. What is this? Your house? Throw it away! Jay, I'm not kidding. You gonna give me a fight? Get out. Get out. Get out. [Engine revving] Ryan Wheeler. [P.A. Beeps] Woman : Ryan Wheeler, please come to reception. Ryan Wheeler, to reception. Ryan : I mean, there was basketball. But then there was a fight, so they hid the ball on us. And then, uh, there's ping-pong, but somebody broke one of the paddles, so... You only had two paddles? Yo, that's it. N-no doubles. [Chuckles] Unless you're on the same team. That's f*cking depressing. No, it's actually not that bad. It's not that good. It's not that good, no. Oh, I wanted to show you... f*ck! [Both laugh] [Dogs barking in distance] How come you haven't come down to the gym, man? It's been a couple weeks. Busy. [Scoffs] It's not you, Ryan. This place is not for you. See... Every day we, uh... [Clears throat] We have these group sessions. We go in the big room. We sit in a big circle. Guys talk about their lives, how they f*cked 'em up... [Laughs] Things you wouldn't believe, like some of the most depressing sh1t I have ever heard. And I'm, like, looking around at the circle, going, like, "what a bunch of f*cking degenerates." And then I'm right there in the middle of it. Ah. Like, I'm in that circle. Like, that's me. That's not you. Yeah. It's not, man. I appreciate what you're saying. You're not like the rest of these f*cking mutts, though. But...I'm here. You know, let's... let's forget about the recovery bullshit for a second. [Chuckling] Okay. Maybe it's not fair, but sometimes God gives some men just a little bit more. It's okay to be exceptional. It is. You hide from that, that's the f*cking sin. You got a talent that nobody else has. Why the f*ck you want to be like everybody else? Eh... I just want to be normal. Normal? He wants to be normal! You're not f*cking normal. I got a plan for you. We bring you along nice and slow. We don't... we don't even... we don't even talk about a fight until you are rock solid on every level. No. No. Nope. I can't get back to where I was. I'm not that animal. Yes, you can. You are that animal. Of course you're that animal. We throw a steak in front of the cave, you come right back. Look, Alvey, I'm really sorry to disappoint you, but... It's not in me anymore. I don't feel it. I can't fight. Bullshit. I understand you got some work to do. But who knows that more than me? Huh? These M*therf*ckers don't know who you are. Be a killer, don't be a f*cking killer. They don't f*cking know that. You're not still hung up about Lisa, right? Well...We don't have to have that conversation? No, I'm... I'm... we don't need to talk about that. I'm just... I certainly don't hold anything against you, if that's... Hold it against me? Why the f*ck would you hold anything against me? You and Lisa were you and Lisa. That was... That was a long time ago. Yeah. No, I'm... I'm, uh... I'm glad you were there, truly. You know, she deserves someone good after...Me. Anyway, I said my piece. I want you to think about it, all right? Mm-hmm. You know where to find me? Yep. Yep. [Clears throat] [A.A.

Alvey : Three and three. Come on. Move it. Taylor. Hey. Hey! What are you f*cking doing here? Alvey said it was cool. We're f*cking allergic to money. Alvey : No, I didn't... he's... All right, end of the week. I'll sell a kidney. Hi, Lisa. Hi, Lisa. Hello. That was chilly. Woman : One, two, three. Ohh! Hey! The prince is back! My son, my son has returned. [Applause] Champ has returned! He's not a pretty boy anymore. Now he looks like a fighter. [Cheers and applause] Yeah! My boy's back! He's back! My boy. [Indistinct conversations] Man : There you go. You got to fix that. Dude, she hates me. Sit, stay, roll over, show her your belly. In here, man, you got to please your master. [Sighs] This sucks. [Imitates barking] Go get her! Hey, hey, Lisa, can I talk to you for a sec? Look, I know you don't want me here. I got it. TRT exemptions are gone, Mac, so what are you selling these guys, huh? Oxy, what? No. Look, I'm just giving Alvey what he medically needs, okay? I'm not pushing. Yeah, except, the last time you were here, a couple of our guys got suspended. Yeah, but, hey, I know the rules now, okay? Look, that was a mistake. I-I'm just here to train. No, no, no, you're here because you helped out Nate, and that means something. Leave your little plastic baggies at home, and we'll see where this goes. But if I even think that you're juicing these guys, you're f*cking gone. Great. That's fair. Okay, I'm gonna need you to fill out the front, the back. Take it up to the second floor. Go to the third window. Thank you. Hello. I'm here to see Detective Gaines. He's unavailable. Um, how do you know that? I'm an oracle. Well, I'm gonna wait to see him, then. He's not gonna see you. Okay, well, I'm a very patient boy with no gainful employment. I have plenty of time. I'll be right here, Officer. [Smooching] [Music plays in distance] Keith. Hey. Look who's back, man. Who's what? Look. Keith. [Sighs] "Look who's back." "Look who's..." Oh, yes! Ohh! Oh, God. [Chuckling] Yes! Oh, yes. [Sniffs] Oh, where did you find him? Ryan : He fell behind your bed. Pfft! No way! I looked there a thousand times. I saw his feet sticking out, and there he was. Well, he's here. Sure. Thanks, man. Hey, no problem, brother. Hey. Hey, man. Thanks. No problem, brother. Hey. No problem. Thanks, Ryan. Just... hey. Keep an eye on him, right? [Chuckling] Right. Right? Don't let him out of your sight. No. Not for one second. Hey, where are you going? A-aren't you working on the kitchen today? No, I've got a new thing now. But I'll be back for curfew. Hey, is it that girl? What? 'Cause she is... [Chuckles] She's really beautiful. Uh...I'll be back before curfew. Attractive. [Door closes] You got her. I got Geoffrey back. [Telephone ringing, police radio chatter] [Sucking teeth] [Can rattles] [Tab pops] Mm. Mmm. Hey, will you get this for me? Yep. [Buzzer] Thank you. Detective Gaines. Hey, look, I'm sorry, kid. I got nothing for you. I need an update, man. Listen, when I know something, we'll let you know something. Well, are you doing anything? Hey. Are you doing anything? What do you want us to do? Oh, I don't know. Huh? I mean, you want me to interview some witnesses? Yeah. Yeah, well, there aren't any. [Chuckles] Except for your brother. And he can't talk, or he won't talk. So we can't do sh1t. We know what you know. Actually, we know less than you know. As a matter of fact, what the f*ck do you know? I know if I could find these fuckers, I'm not gonna sit around in your lobby all afternoon drinking f*cking soda. You know what? Now that I'm starting to look at you, this is getting real interesting to me. I mean, why would somebody jump your brother? He seems to be a good kid. Got no enemies. But you, on the other hand, you're a bit of a shit-head. Maybe you got the enemies, huh? You want to talk to me about that? Yeah. That's what I thought. Until your brother starts talking, we're at a standstill. [Door opens] Hey, I pay taxes. Do your f*cking job. [Scoffs] sh1t, son. You ain't posted a W-2 since you were born. f*ck you! f*ck! Get on the ground! Hey, hey! Get on the ground! It was just a f*cking reflex, dude. I said get on the ground! Don't move! Do not move! Detective, that was a reflex. Down on the ground! I'm sorry. Come on, guys. Jesus. Get down. Can you just f... Are you out of your mind? You just made it worse for yourself, son. [Handcuffs click] Get this piece of sh1t out of here. f*ck! Nice and slow! [Grunting] Hey. Hey. It's getting a little crowded in here, huh? Yeah, that's a good thing. Yeah, except my pros can't get on the bag because Lawyer McBrentwood wants to do his cardio after he works out. Okay, well, uh, Lawyer McBrentwood paid for that heavy bag so... you know, I don't like them hovering around him. They're scaring the money. Oh, come on. They're just f*cking with him. [Laughs] Come here. Come here. Come here! Where you going? What? Sit down. [Chuckling] No. Come on, I want to talk with you. [Laughing] No. Sit down. No, you're gross and sweaty! Love me. Love me. I need love. I just took a shower. I need love! I need love! Okay, all right. Okay. That's it? Yeah. I just showered. That's it? No, I just showered. Alvey, I just... This is my gym. [Laughs] My gym, too. This is my gym. Let's fight for it. Let's fight for it. Seriously?! I just... [Laughs] Oh, ew! Alvey, no! Come on! Ew! I'm so sweaty. Oh, now I smell like you! Oh, it's beautiful. Come on. It's disgusting. Alvey. Alvey. Oh, give me love. Give me love. All right, I love you. I love you. Leave me alone now. Hey. Hey. You here for real? Let's see what happens.
