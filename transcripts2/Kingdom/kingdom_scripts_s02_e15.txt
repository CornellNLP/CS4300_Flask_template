 I'm sorry, you might as well get something out of it. 
 Please, leave a message after the beep. 
 You can call me if you want. 
 Really you are coming into a fight. 
 Jay won the fight, and that's all I'm gonna say about that. 
 But you want another shot. 
 f*ck yeah. he tried to rape her. 
 What's his name? 
 You will make this way harder on me I've never been sued before. 
 He's got a case. 
 If you choose to engage me as your attorney, um... 
 Engaged. you got a guy? You seeing somebody? 
 I'm working here right now, as a professional attorney. 
 Let me buy you a drink. 
 I think we can go further. 
 Want you want I do. 
 Take the top off. if I'm naked, how am I modeling your clothes? 
 Is that a problem? 
 I'm uncomfortable. 
 I'm at a photo shoot, I'm gonna come get you. 
 Where is she? 
 You got to be more careful. 
 You all right to drive? 
 I just don't... want to go back to the gym. 
 Can I stay at your place? 
 It'll just be for tonight.

 Yo?

 [Beep] 
 Hey. It's me. I'm at the gym. 
 Where you at? 
 You go out? 
 You're, uh... You're probably somewhere. 
 Uh... 
 Call me. 
 I'll wait for a little bit. 
 [Woman moaning, man grunting] 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 Oh! 
 Come on. Come on! 
 [Grunts] 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Ah. Jesus. 
 Ah. 
 [Laughs] 
 Was that good? 
 [Laughs] 
 What? What do you think? 
 I don't know. I think it was good. 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, no. 
 I'm good. I'm really, really good. 
 Okay. 
 Your turn now. You can do whatever you want. 
 Anything I want? 
 Yeah. 
 I like some fucked-up weird sh1t. 
 Maybe you should be f*cked and punished. 
 Ah. I guess I'll get what I deserve. 
 Yeah? You're not gonna sue me, are you? 
 [Laughs] Huh? 
 ♪ 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Woman : Are you currently experiencing any thoughts of homicide or suicide? 
 No. 
 What led you to seek counseling? 
 My dad died, and I'm having... 
 And I'm having a hard time, uh... just controlling myself. 
 I'm, uh... 
 I'm angry. 
 When did your symptoms start, and for how long have you had them? 
 The anger? 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 I guess I've always had it, but recently, it's, uh... been worse. 
 Have you had any previous psychological or psychiatric treatment? 
 Um... 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Any family history of emotional illness? 
 Not that I know of. 
 Do you drink alcohol or take any illegal drugs? 
 Yes, sometimes. 
 To which? 
 Both, but only... only sometimes. 
 What's your relationship like with your family? 
 None. We don't talk. 
 Describe your friends, your social life. 
 Who do you turn to for emotional support? 
 My teammates and my coach. 
 I have a roommate. 
 I mostly keep my own counsel. 
 What's the highest level of education that you've completed? 
 College. 
 And your current profession? 
 I'm a professional fighter. 
 Have you ever been convicted of any crimes? 
 Yes. 
 I, uh... assaulted my father and served time in prison for it. 
 How many traffic violations have you had in the last five years? 
 Zero. I'm an excellent driver. 
 What do you hope to achieve through counseling? 
 [Clears throat] 
 I don't want to go back to the way I was. 
 [Bluesy rock music plays] 
 [Sighs] 
 Good morning, Ava. 
 Good morning. Have you seen my sunglasses? 
 They're on your head. 
 [Chuckles] Geez. 
 Would you like some breakfast? 
 No, thanks. 
 You sure? 
 Yep. 
 You've been here four days. 
 I haven't seen you eat a bite of food. 
 Jay, neither. 
 We eat. I-I'm just not hungry. 
 Good morning. 
 Good morning. 
 So what are you two doing today? 
 We're just gonna be here, relaxing by the pool. 
 Again? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought you'd be back in the gym by now. 
 Well... 
 My body's a temple. I'm taking some time off. 
 All right. Well... 
 I'm gonna be volunteering at the needle exchange all day, so I won't be in your way. 
 Ava : You're not in the way. 
 That's very nice of you to say, Ava. 
 Thank you. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You guys need anything while I'm out? 
 Um, we're... we're good. Thanks, Mom. 
 And I'm gonna clean up the kitchen later, so don't worry about it. 
 Have a good day. 
 All right, be careful. 
 I will. 
 You know, a lot of fucked-up people go to that needle exchange. 
 I know, Jay. I was one of them. 
 They need help. 
 I'll be fine. 
 She's a lot of work. 
 Alvey : f*cking kill me. 
 Okay. 
 You want an open casket, or can I have some fun with it? 
 No, go crazy. I want to be unrecognizable. 
 They'll need dental records. 
 Oh, well, that won't help, because they won't be able to find your teeth. 
 What's in here? 
 [Laughing] Stop! 
 Come on. 
 You know what? 
 I can't because I have court, and I'm really late. 
 Oh. 
 I'll see you later? 
 Really? 
 What? 
 Four nights in a row? 
 I mean, we can take a... we can take a night off. 
 Well, how about we do dinner and no sleep-over? 
 So I spend all my money and I don't get any... 
 Well, I'm fine to eat alone, too, so either way. 
 [Laughing] Wow! 
 All right. Fine. I'll take what I can get. 
 All right, good. 
 You have to get out of here, 'cause I'm late. 
 I was going anyway, all right? Because... 
 I'm a business owner. I have things to do myself. 
 See you later. 
 See you later.

 [Siren wails in distance] 
 Oh. Uh... 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 Hi. Um... 
 I'm... I'm looking for, uh, Christina? 
 Is she... Jay? 
 Yeah? 
 Somebody's here to see your mom. 
 You're here to see my mother? 
 No. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. 
 No, he said he's here to see Christina. 
 Are you the guy? 
 No. 
 No, no, no, are you the guy who put your hand on my f*cking mother? 
 I don't know, I... 
 [Grunts] 
 Holy sh1t. 
 I'm gonna need you to spend the day with your sister. 
 [Rock music playing] 
 I admire your beard. 
 Oh. I had to trim it up a little bit. 
 Yeah, looks good. 
 Just be careful. 
 About my beard? 
 Yeah, you come to rely on it, you know? 
 Pretty soon, you won't look good without it. 
 Maybe you guys should f*ck each other. 
 I keep asking, but, you know... 
 Where's Jay, man? How long do we have to wait? 
 I don't know. He's not answering his phone. 
 Probably pissed about Mario's article. 
 Gonna sh1t all over his win. 
 He twisted my words. I didn't say it like that. 
 That's not how I said it. 
 All right, all right, you know what? 
 Let's... Let's... Let's sort Ryan out, and then we'll deal with Jay later. 
 Guys... 
 I want a rematch. 
 I'm in. I want it. 
 Hold on. Hold on. 
 How much? 
 What do you mean, how much? 
 I mean how much are you gonna pay him? 
 [Scoffs] The same as last time. 
 I want you to do better. 
 Alvey, we had a deal. 
 Six fights, he has four left. 
 A deal? 
 Of course. 
 You sell f*cking rugs with that deal. 
 First of all, that's racist, okay? We don't sell rugs. 
 That's not what my people are known for. 
 Guys, with love in my heart, Ryan lost the fight. 
 I'm not gonna give him a raise. 
 If you win the fight, if you knock him out, then I'll give you a nice bonus. 
 I promise. 
 That's fine. I just want the fight. 
 Fantastic. You? 
 Okay. Let's do it. 
 Ha ha! Makes me very happy. 
 Always a pleasure, my friend. 
 Tell me about Jay, I'll set it up. 
 In the meantime, my friend, take care of your knee. 
 Careful. 
 You have a girl named Alicia? 
 Alicia Mendez, I do. 
 I keep hearing her name. 
 Can I take a look? 
 [Rock music continues] 
 [Grunting] 
 f*ck me. 
 Yeah, well, she doesn't know what the f*ck she's doing yet, but everything's there. 
 She in shape? 
 Yeah, she's in f*cking shape. 
 What did you have in mind? 
 I have a show in Pasadena. 
 I thought that's full. 
 It is, but I don't like one of the fighters. 
 Her manager cheated on my cousin's daughter, so... 
 I'll bump her. I'll put Alicia in, no problem. 
 All right. I'll talk to her. 
 [Grunting] 
 Cheers. 
 Sure you don't want anything? 
 I'm good. 
 You on the wagon or something? 
 I have a fight coming up. 
 Oh, yeah? Whereabouts? 
 Downtown. 
 Nate, relax. 
 Just two guys having lunch, no big deal. 
 You're safe. 
 I'm glad you called. 
 To be honest, I didn't think you would. 
 Me neither. 
 So why did you? 
 I had some questions. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Go on, then. 
 Why did he put in my drink? 
 Probably Rohypnol. 
 But I wasn't there, so I can't be sure. 
 Bob's life is in compartments... like a terrorist cell. 
 Is this sh1t funny to you? 
 No. No, not at all, mate. 
 I think it's f*cking horrifying. 
 I'm just always amazed at what money and shame can buy you in this town. 
 Excuse me. One more, please. Thanks. 
 Here's the thing with Bob. 
 If you go back at him, he's just gonna give you more money, and you'll take it. 
 And then... then he'll own you. 
 How the f*ck do you think I got here?

 Jason Ferris, head treatment counselor. 
 Yeah. 
 I paid you a lot of money for services that included group therapy, meditation, acupuncture, and... and it goes on. 
 But... 
 [Sighs] 
 No. 
 I don't see anything here that includes rape therapy. 
 How about you tell me about that? 
 Look, I-I understand that you... you may have heard some things... 
 Yeah, I have, but not enough. 
 Now, f*cking you up, that was a reflex. 
 And if I've got all this wrong, I apologize in advance. 
 But I'm in a... [Inhales deeply] 
 I'm in a fog of war right now... so how about you telling me exactly what happened with you and my mom? 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm? 
 I'm gonna tell you everything, okay? 
 [Slurps] 
 Um... 
 I pretty quickly developed... inappropriate feelings for Christina. 
 My mother. Christina's my mother. 
 That's why I'm asking you about all this. 
 Yes, your mother. Y-Your mother. 
 Um, uh... 
 [Sighs] 
 It... It started off as just an emotional connection. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Um, but rehab is... It's... 
 Um... 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 There... There's an... 
 There's an outpouring of feelings when the drugs are gone, and it can lead to a... 
 [Sighs] 
 Uh, an accelerated... intimacy. 
 "Accelerated intimacy." 
 Hmm. 
 Were you f*cking my mother? 
 It's okay. Answer the question. 
 You can answer the question. 
 I wouldn't put it that way, but, um... 
 Yes, we were physical, and it was consensual. 
 But it was a... 
 It was a horrible lapse in judgment for me. 
 It was more a betrayal. 
 When did it start? 
 Since, like, about a week into her stay. 
 "A week into her stay." 
 I don't know why it happened that night. 
 Week into her... 
 I was... 
 I mean, I was drunk, and she was... deceptive. 
 How was she deceptive? 
 How was she deceptive? 
 I-I-I realized that she had no feelings for me at all. 
 That she was just... 
 She was manipulating me. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And it overwhelmed me. 
 It was overwhelming. 
 Yeah? 
 Um... why exactly did you come here? 
 I came to apologize. 
 I swear. 
 What are you gonna do to me? 
 I don't know, Jason. I don't know. 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 It's just lot of sh1t for me to process, all this information, so I don't have an answer for you. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Punk music playing] 
 Hey, stranger. 
 Haven't seen you in a couple nights. 
 Just been trying to stay healthy, you know? 
 I get f*cked up, sleep... 
 Ah. 
 [Laughs] That's funny. 
 That's really funny. 
 Why is that funny? 
 Because, um... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Because I came by late last night, and you weren't here. 
 Yeah, I was staying at Alvey's. 
 Come on, dude, it's not like that. 
 Look, he hasn't even been there the last few nights. 
 That's fine, yeah. 
 Well, if you needed a place to stay, why don't you stay with me? 
 'Cause I don't want to. 
 Look, I feel comfortable there. 
 All right. That's it. 
 It's your business. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 These are for you. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. They're pretty. 
 You can put them in the lounge. 
 Here. Thank you. 
 Be safe. 
 
 
 
 Hi, sweetie. What do you need? 
 Needles and some condoms, please. 
 How's your day going? 
 Fine. 
 I'm sorry. Is your name Chelsea? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm Christina. 
 Well, we never met, but I came into Casa Rosa the last week you were there. 
 I got to go. 
 Hey, Chelsea? 
 Where are you staying? 
 With friends. 
 Okay, if that falls through or if you need anything... call me. 
 That's my cell. 
 Be safe. 
 [Rock music playing] 
 [Grunting] 
 Hey, Coach. Hey. 
 You got a sec? 
 Why? What? 
 I've been at this a while. 
 Somebody asks me if I got a second, usually means we're gonna have a shitty conversation. 
 It doesn't have to be. 
 What's on your mind? 
 Well, have you given any more thought about what I said? 
 About what? 
 Coaching me, not splitting your time between me and Jay. 
 Oh, yeah, I have. Mm-hmm. 
 Well, what do you think? 
 What I think is that you should give me five f*cking minutes to figure it out, man. 
 I haven't even seen Jay since the fight. 
 Okay, 'cause I just need to know if I need to find a new place to train. 
 Okay, you'll be the first to know. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, and, Alvey? 
 Yeah? 
 You really think it's a good idea to have Alicia staying at your house? 
 Are you f*cking kidding me, dude? 
 What? 
 You know nothing's going on with me and Alicia. 
 Don't f*ck with me. 
 I know. 
 I'm just saying it doesn't look good. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Okay. 
 Ahh. 
 I'm gonna get another one. 
 As my father used to say, you get one buzz a day, you best keep it going. 
 Hey, I don't get many days off, all right? 
 Go for it. 
 You don't have to stay. 
 I'm good. 
 So, tell me, what's the day in the life of a pro MMA fighter? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I wake up, train, teach a class maybe, and... deal with whatever's going on at the gym. 
 And do it all over again... every day. 
 Have I f*cked up your routine? 
 No, I'll train tonight, so... 
 I like it better when the gym's empty anyway. 
 I used to do a bit of Muay Thai, actually, back in Manchester. 
 You know, just to keep fit. 
 I liked it. 
 Love to see you fight sometime. 
 f*ck's sake, man. 
 What? 
 It's like talking to a brick wall. 
 No, I'm serious. Do you ever speak? 
 Yeah, when I have something to say. 
 And does that ever happen? 
 Right now, I'm just listening. 
 I like it. 
 It's good to sit with a man who can handle silence. 
 These days, everyone wants to fill the space. 
 It's like, "Shut up for two f*cking seconds, please." 
 For example? 
 Oh, that... that was a joke, was it? 
 Look, Jay's a good guy. 
 And? 
 And don't f*ck with him. 
 f*ck you. I'm not. 
 Where you guys been, anyways? 
 His house. 
 Doing what? 
 Nothing. He's taking some time off. 
 Why is everyone freaking out? 
 Because Jay's done a lot of work to get to where he's at, Ava, and he could lose it fast. 
 I... I really like him. 
 We fit together. 
 Hey... 
 I don't want to fight. 
 Please? Can we stop? 
 Yeah, I don't want to fight, either. 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you mad at me? 
 No, I just... I thought you came here to see me. 
 I did. 
 Yeah, well, I haven't seen you. 
 Because you're always here, and you don't ever want to go out, and I'm just trying to stay out of your way. 
 I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. 
 Hey... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know. 
 I just wish I would be able to hang out with you while you're here, you know? 
 Hey. You seen Jay? 
 He's at his house. 
 Can you tell him to pick up his phone, please? 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Yeah. 
 All right.

 Now, on your f*cking knees. 
 Okay. 
 And... And... And do it properly, hmm? 
 Say you're sorry. 
 Oh. 
 I... 
 I can't imagine the ways in which, um... you've been mistreated. 
 Yes, you can. 
 I told you all about it when I was under your care. 
 I know. 
 I meant that... 
 [Sobs] 
 I'm not like these other men that took advantage of you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I fell in love with you. 
 [Crying] You have... such a pure heart. 
 And there's such a wound. 
 And I wanted to heal you. 
 I wanted to show you how incredible you are. 
 God, you are so pretty. 
 And smart. 
 And there is no excuse for what I did. 
 But... my feelings for you just... exploded. 
 And I acted out. 
 And that was so bad. 
 I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 You're right, Jason. 
 You're not like all those other men. 
 You're worse. 
 Um, you want me to hit him? Or do you want to hit him? 
 You want to hit him, Mom? 
 No. 
 Get him out of our house.

 Hi. Sorry. 
 Hey, no worries. 
 Oh. 
 All right? 
 Yeah. 
 I got you a martini. Yes, please. 
 Rough day? 
 Oh. You know, I just wish sometimes people would shut the f*ck up and do what they're supposed to do. 
 People f*cking up is your bread and butter. 
 That's how you found me. 
 True. 
 Speaking of... 
 Any news on my case? 
 Actually, yeah, there is. 
 So they want to settle. 
 I'm not settling. I'm not settling. 
 I'm never settling. It's my word against his. 
 No, it's not. 
 There was a witness. 
 Apparently, there was a guy across the street watering his lawn, and he saw the whole thing. 
 So, yeah, you're gonna have to pay. 
 What do they want? 
 Well, they want a half million. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I went back at a hundred, and they came back at 150. 
 $150,000? 
 Yeah. 
 I have to advise you to take it because, honestly, that's the best we're gonna do. 
 I don't have $150,000. 
 I-I didn't even touch this f*cking guy. 
 People suck. 
 I'm allergic to money. That's what it is. 
 No. You're not. 
 You just have to be a little bit more careful. 
 You know, next time, you just have to... look both ways. 
 Oh, that's... 
 That is just stellar advice, counselor, really. 
 You gonna bill me for that? 
 No. That's for free. 
 Now, what are we gonna do? 
 Are we just gonna, like, sit around here and cry about it? 
 Or do you want to try and salvage the evening? 
 What'd you have in mind? 
 I think we should get a little drunk and mess around. 
 As long as you pay for the drinks, 'cause I don't have any money now. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Footsteps] 
 This has to stop. 
 He... He tried to rape you. 
 No, I'm talking about you. 
 Yeah, Mom... 
 I cannot be around you if you're gonna get high. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm not strong enough. 
 And I don't like Ava. 
 I don't think she's good for you. 
 I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel. 
 It's fine, Mom. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Sweetie, I don't know what to do. 
 Maybe I need to leave. 
 And live alone? 
 I've done it before. 
 What would have happened if he found you? 
 [Sniffles] 
 Hmm? No. 
 You should stay here with Nate, and I'll go. 
 No, I don't want you to go. 
 I don't want you to leave. 
 It's okay. 
 I want you to stop getting f*cked up! 
 I'll be fine. 
 I will, just not right now. 
 It's okay. You know, it's fine. 
 Jay! 
 I just need a break, Mom. That's what I need. 
 And then I'll be back. 
 So... 
 You just tell Nate that... 
 I'll be home soon, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [Sniffling] 
 Oh. 
 [Keys jingling] 
 This means that you're... you're over that taking the night off bullshit, yeah? 
 No. 
 What if I don't want to? 
 Well, then, that's a sad story. 
 Because we're not gonna do it tonight. 
 Why? Why? 
 Why? 
 Because I... 
 I just don't know you well enough. 
 I don't know you well enough to sleep with you four nights in a row. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 What do you want to f*cking know? 
 I'll tell you anything. Ask. 
 Why did you get divorced? 
 She was f*cking crazy, and I was f*cking nuts. 
 We were too young. Why'd you get divorced? 
 Because I didn't love him. 
 Why'd you marry him? 
 Because I was 30 and stupid and scared. 
 Hmm. 
 You still in touch with her? 
 Not unless I have to be. 
 You still hung up on her? 
 Christina? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 f*ck no. 
 No? 
 No. 
 'Cause her name is on your chest. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 In case you forgot. 
 It's 'cause I'm f*cking lazy. 
 I'm gonna get it... I'm gonna get rid of it. 
 I just haven't figured out what to get on top of it, that's all. 
 Okay. 
 No, we've been over a long time. 
 She's not in my life. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 One of your fighters? 
 Yeah. No f*cking boundaries. 
 Well, you can answer it if you want. 
 I'm off the clock. You want another drink? 
 Yeah, I have room for one more. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Hey, Coach, it's me. Um... 
 I, uh... I was just calling to see if you had a chance to break down the tape yet and, uh... also... 
 I had some ideas, too. So, uh... 
 If... Just call me back if you get this. 
 And, uh... 
 I'll be up for a while, okay? 
 All right, thanks, Coach.
