 Previously on "Recovery Road"... 
 I have a fiancé. 
 I know you do. 
 You're incredible. 
 I can't seem to get her to make the right choices. 
 Do you know what Al-Anon is? 
 Newcomer? I'm Alan. 
 I'm Charlotte. 
 It's my first meeting. 
 What is that? 
 A Xanax. 
 If you need this to pull yourself together, I won't say a word. 
 I was just in the bathroom with Trish. 
 You know that tattoo of her daughter's name? 
 She showed it to me, and there's no tattoo. 
 Is it the same gun? I'll deal with it. 
 It Diesel's idea. He told Asa to plant the gun on you. 
 Diesel's crazy. There's nothing that your brother could have done. 
 There's a whole lot he could have done, like not frame his brother. 
 It's called Suboxone. It's used to treat addiction. 
 They were really helping me stay sober. 
 We always supported all our children in all their endeavors. 
 Except when it came to your other daughter Rebecca, who you turned your back on. 
 Maddie : Every person in Rebecca's life turned their back on her, even me. 
 You don't deserve Rebecca. 
 A more clinical environment might work for some individuals, but... 
 Maddie : Taking the first step, giving up control... (chattering) that leap into the unknown is filled with such trepidation. 
 Until... (chattering continues) you see the opportunity. 
 It sounds wonderful. 
 You always have liked spas. 
 Woman : I really don't want you to get the wrong impression. 
 We take our group care very seriously. 
 (chattering) 
 Woman : how rigorous in structure our days are, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
 What does the intake process entail? 
 Standard. Rebecca would meet with a medical doctor, we'd search her belongings in person. 
 She'd get settled in her room and then we'd have her meet with her primary therapist. 
 That all sounds fine. 
 What do you think, dear? 
 I think this place seems perfect. 
 She sent you, like, six different date looks. 
 And now it's eight. 
 This one's kind of fun, though. 
 Yeah, I'd wear that. 
 You want to borrow clothes from my mom? 
 I don't think we can be friends anymore. 
 You're such a bitch. 
 I never really saw your mom as the neurotic type. 
 She's not. 
 I blame Alan Al-Anon. 
 I take it they met at Al-Anon? 
 When did you get so clever? 
 Ha ha. Shut up. 
 Wes, are you going to help out with Trish's party? 
 Can't. Sorry. 
 Okay, is it just me or is he acting super weird? 
 Yep, for days. 
 So, I think I know why. 
 It's because of me. 
 It's because of us... Wes and me. 
 Our relationship, it's confusing, and I thought we were going to talk about things, but we haven't. 
 I thought everything was okay. It's not. 
 Or it could have something to do with Harper. 
 Harper? 
 Yeah. 
 Jasper said that she stopped by the house and she and Wes disappeared for four hours last week. 
 Oh, wow. Okay. 
 Do you think we should tell Craig? 
 We should probably tell... 
 No, I think... 
 Come on, people, we need more decorations. 
 And not sad Dollar Store decorations. 
 Nice decorations. And where's that turntable? 
 Why is this banner crooked? 
 Okay, okay, okay, and on to balloons. 
 We need more of them. Lots more. 
 But not too many, because then they'll get cruise ship tacky. 
 So more than 20, but less than 100. 
 And no, I repeat, no green! 
 Trish hates green. I think. Whatever. 
 Just can't risk it. 
 So, question... 
 No, you cannot be relieved of your party duties, and, yes, I'll probably need you to go to the store. 
 Okay, cool. I just wanted to ask you about Wes. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yep. 
 So we shouldn't be worried? 
 Wes can be moody. 
 A lot's been going on lately, but he'll be okay. 
 So, you'd let us know if anything's wrong? 
 Come on, guys, you know I can't... sponsor-sponsee privilege, you know? 
 It's just that we know Harper was here. 
 Wait, what? 
 He's in the basement. 
 Thanks. 
 Really? 
 A gun? 
 You buried a gun? A gun that killed someone? 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 I don't know. Harper said we should and I didn't know what else to do. 
 Go to the police and turn it in, that's what you do. 
 I can't do that to my brother, I just can't. 
 There's loyalty and there's stupidity. 
 He's trying to frame you. 
 You have to go to the police! 
 You don't do that to family. It's not right. 
 I need to talk to him before I do anything. 
 That is the last thing that you need to do. 
 It's what I'm doing. I need to hear it from him. 
 Are you doubting Harper's telling you the truth? 
 No, she only lies when she's using and right now she's clean. 
 Harper's got my back. 
 I just need to talk to Asa. 
 I'm going with you. 
 No, you're not. 
 Who knows what you'll be walking into? 
 Look, it'll be worse if you come. 
 It'll freak him out, and this is something I need to do alone. 
 Wes. 
 We have to go after him. 
 What? No way. 
 We have to, he's probably going to go see Harper, and bad things always happen when she's involved. 
 Just trust me, we have to go. 
 What are we going to tell Vern? 
 He already said he might need me to go to the store. 
 It'll be fine. 
 Look, I'm worried, too, but following Wes is crazy. 
 Whatever. 
 I'm going with or without you. 
 If you're not, that's cool... 
 All right, all right. I'll drive. 
 (music playing) 
 Oh, Vern. How's the party stuff? 
 Fine. Great. Not why I'm here. 
 Okay. 
 I just got some information, and I think someone has been in the house who shouldn't have been. 
 Asa. Was it Asa? 
 I told Wes in no uncertain terms... 
 It's someone else. 
 Who? 
 It doesn't matter. I just need you to do a house search today. 
 Why? 
 Just do it. 
 Please? 
 You really can't elaborate? 
 I told you all the info you need. 
 Right. Got it. Okay. 
 Well, I'm off to get Trish in a few, but I can call Donna Marie to come in and do the search. 
 Great. Thanks. 
 Joan Didion. Great writer. 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, just started. 
 I'm liking it so far. 
 Yeah, she's good. 
 Cynthia got me into her work. She loves her. 
 Really? Oh. 
 That's, uh... I... 
 I had absolutely no idea. 
 If it were up to me, there's no way jerked chicken lasagna, matzo ball soup, and a green bean casserole would make it onto the same table. 
 But, God, have I missed that girl. 
 I'll make anything she wants for dinner tonight. 
 But only tonight. 
 From what I heard, she missed you, too. 
 Oh, really? Who told you that? 
 Craig told me. 
 Craig? 
 Would have been nice if he'd told me that. 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Oh. Can I help you? 
 I hope so. I'm looking for my fiancée. 
 She's, uh... there she is. 
 Paul. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Wow, what a surprise. 
 Hey, man. How are you? 
 Hey, good to see you. 
 Yeah, see you. 
 See you, too. 
 Let me introduce you to... 
 Craig. I'm Craig. Lovely to meet you. Really. Pleasure. 
 Hi. 
 Wow, you're here. 
 Yeah. 
 Great. Why are you... 
 You left your phone on the kitchen counter this morning. 
 I just thought I'd swing by and drop it off for you. 
 Oh, awesome. Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 I guess I'll see you later? 
 Do you need any help with the party? 
 I thought you were hanging out with Mike today. 
 Not for a couple hours. 
 I figured it might be fun to come by, help out, get to know everybody a little bit better since you're spending so much time here lately. 
 I blame this guy for that. 
 Ah, my bad. 
 Not cool. Shouldn't have monopolized your fiancée's time like that. 
 Speaking of time, look at the time. 
 I'm sorry I can't stay and chat, but I should get going. 
 It's a long drive to pick up Trish. 
 So, very nice meeting you and perhaps I'll see you when I get back. 
 You going to put me to work, boss? 
 Yeah. (chuckles) 
 It's so weird. 
 What? No, no. 
 Following your friend isn't weird at all, it's normal. 
 It's super, super normal. 
 I really thought he was going to Harper's. 
 It's Diesel. 
 We have to get over there. 
 No, Maddie. No, no. 
 We can't. Maddie, we can't. 
 What is Wes going to do if we just bust in there? 
 You're right, you're right. 
 Okay, okay. You're right, you're right. 
 It's just that that guy, he knows Asa and he's a drug dealer and I think Wes might be here because he's a customer. 
 No, thanks. I'm sober. 
 Oh, yeah? Prove it. 
 Satisfied? 
 So, what's up? 
 Asa hasn't been returning my calls. 
 You know where he is? 
 Am I your brother's keeper? 
 You know what? Cut the crap. 
 I know. 
 About? 
 The pharmacy. 
 I don't think he's here to buy drugs. 
 Right, yeah, because usually when people go to a drug dealer's house they're coming for a couple of laughs, stimulating conversation. 
 He's not using. 
 You know that for a fact? 
 No, but I'm pretty sure. 
 I'm almost positive. 
 He's in a really good place with his sobriety right now. 
 Really? 
 That's good to hear. 
 Yeah. 
 We check in with each other a lot. 
 He really gets what I've been through. 
 We both had so many false starts, you know? 
 Do you have anything to say for yourself? 
 I hope you get a refund? 
 Sorry, Dad, sorry. That's a joke. 
 I couldn't look anyone in the eye in there. 
 I don't know what's happened to you. 
 When did you become so... so... 
 I am utterly at a loss. This is her third time. 
 This is your third time getting kicked out of rehab for smuggling drugs in. 
 Do you have any idea what it costs to go to one of these places? 
 Less than Penelope's med school. 
 I'll spend every last penny I have on Penelope because Penelope has a bright future. 
 What do you have? 
 What is the best that I can expect from you, Rebecca? 
 That you'll stay clean for longer than a month? 
 That you won't call me at all hours of the night asking for money? 
 That you won't disgrace our family more than you already have? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I found a place for you. 
 It's a sober living facility. 
 After detox, they'll admit you. 
 And sorry doesn't cut it anymore. 
 This is the last time I'm doing this. 
 Diesel : What about the pharmacy? 
 I know you took a guy out. 
 That night Asa went to the pharmacy with me? 
 Yeah. 
 That didn't happen. 
 So, this is how you're going to play it. Cool. 
 Nothing happened at the pharmacy. 
 I got a guy that I work with there sometimes. 
 Hooks me up with pills, I give him a quarter of the profit. 
 Asa went with me that night. 
 Picked up the scrips, exchanged a few pleasantries. 
 I slipped my man his cut and that was it. 
 Really? That's it? 
 Yep. 
 I guess it's my word against your brother's. 
 Kind of a toss-up, huh? 
 Not really, man. 
 I get it. He's your brother. 
 You trust him. 
 But me? I don't trust a damn word that comes out of his mouth. 
 The kid just says whatever the hell he has to to save his own ass. 
 That's not true. 
 Come on. 
 West Covina? 
 He was tweaking. 
 You ever rat him out when you were high? 
 No. 
 Me, neither. 
 We're both better to him than he's ever been to us. 
 So, that night at the pharmacy it was just you and Asa? 
 Harper was there, too. 
 She stayed in the car. I asked her not to come in. 
 Your brother and her, they annoy me. 
 They're always all over each other. It's gross. 
 They're together? 
 Yeah, they have been for a while now. 
 I'm sorry. I thought you knew. 
 I knew you didn't. I knew Asa wouldn't tell you. 
 I just wanted to see the look on your face when you found out. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Whatever. 
 Don't ask questions if you don't want answers. 
 Harper's your brother's little slut now. 
 That bitch is so... 
 Shut up! 
 Or what? You're going to punch me? 
 Come on. Do it. 
 I dare you. 
 You know what? If you hear from Asa, have him call me. 
 Is that you don't believe in global warming. 
 No, it's not that I don't believe it, I just think you guys are blowing it way out of proportion as usual. 
 I come bearing cupcakes. 
 Salted caramel. 
 They might have entirely too much salt. 
 I don't know. First time I've ever tried making them. 
 Why are you doing this to me? 
 What? What am I doing? What did I do? 
 Relax, I'm joking. You're just... you're tempting me to cheat on my diet. 
 Oh, right. You're still paleo. 
 Good one. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. I just always get a little stressed before a party. 
 Oh, man. That is so worth the cheat. 
 I'm so glad. 
 Me, too, because when it comes to cheating, it's not always worth it. 
 Throwing everything away, you know? 
 Dude, it's one cupcake. 
 Slippery slope. 
 One cupcake leads to another cupcake. 
 The next thing you know, you're wolfing down entire pizzas and hiding it from your friends and your family, cheating right under their noses. 
 You know they won't approve, but you just can't stop because that all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet is just too hard to resist. 
 And then someone puts it all together and they see how you stare at that moo shu chicken. 
 Then what do you do? 
 How do you explain yourself? 
 Sorry. 
 I have a very complicated relationship with food. 
 I'm bummed I can't stay, but Mike's only in town for the night. 
 No, that's fine. I totally get it. 
 Call me if you want to meet us later, okay? 
 Okay, will do. 
 Okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 
 
 
 Come on. 
 Craig? The other guy you were telling me about was Craig? 
 How could you do this? This is not okay! 
 You didn't seem so opposed to it before you knew it was him. 
 Some random guy that you kissed one time is not the same as you having an affair with my counselor, my friend! 
 There's so many other people involved. 
 Do you have any idea what this means for him, or for me or Maddie... the other people in this house? 
 It's not like I intended for this to happen, to make things weird and complicated. 
 I didn't... 
 Craig does not deserve to be treated like this. 
 I'm really not toying with him. 
 I'm confused! 
 Don't care. 
 I really don't care. 
 I'm just so disappointed. 
 I have so much on my plate right now, and I just really wish that I didn't have... 
 How could you do this? 
 You of all people should know. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 You're going to pretend like you've never hooked up with guys who were in relationships? 
 Please, it's not even the same thing. 
 You had a full-blown affair with your brother's best friend who was married. 
 How is that not the same thing? 
 I made a lot of mistakes when I was coked up. 
 I did a lot of things that I am not proud of. 
 But you? You are in your right mind. 
 You have no excuse. 
 And then, uh... then it started getting worse. 
 She was coming home later and later, She would always call, always had some excuse, but it was harder and harder to buy into it. 
 I couldn't talk to her about it. 
 Well, I didn't know how to. 
 And then... then this one night, she didn't come home at all. 
 She didn't call, snuck in right before her alarm went off, and... 
 I have never been so scared. 
 And I couldn't not do something, so... 
 I had them do a locker search at her school. 
 She thinks it was random. She doesn't know it was me. 
 I almost told her the other day, but... we're doing so well right now. 
 She's doing so well. 
 And, um... 
 Well, I... 
 I don't want to mess that up. 
 Not when... not when I'm starting to feel like I have my daughter back. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 How things go with your brother? 
 You guys talk things through? 
 Yeah. Yeah, we did. 
 So, you got answers. Everything's fine. 
 Yeah, it really is. Thanks, man. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Wes, I'm really proud of you, confronting that difficult situation head-on and really resolving it. 
 Uh-huh. Thanks. 
 What took you guys so long? 
 We forgot the ice. 
 Yeah, and we hit really heavy traffic. 
 We had to go back to the store to get Trish her Gummi Worms, because you know how much she loves them. 
 Oh, my God, yes. That totally makes up for your long, long absence. 
 You want to tell me why you followed me? 
 We were worried. We have been. 
 We saw you rush out and we thought... 
 Thought it would be a good idea to follow me. 
 That is so screwed up. 
 Okay, whatever. 
 What other choice did we have? 
 It's not like you've been talking to us or letting us in on what's going on with you or talking to us. 
 We had to find out from Jasper that Harper was here. 
 What the hell was she doing here? 
 Places, everyone! 
 They're here! Okay, lot of energy, lot of enthusiasm. 
 Big, big smiles! 
 I'll tell you later. I just can't tell you now, okay? 
 Why not? 
 Because it's complicated and I can't even begin to... 
 Forget it. 
 It's fine. It's totally fine. 
 I guess I thought we were close and we told each other stuff. 
 But obviously I was mistaken and it's fine. 
 Okay, fine. Fine. 
 Fine. 
 Surprise! 
 Does Donna Marie get excited about anything? 
 Never even seen her smile. 
 Will you please let me explain my side before judging me and condemning me? 
 No, because nothing you say is going to change my mind. 
 What you're doing, what you did... wrong. 
 Oh, come on. Get off your high horse. 
 It's not that simple, and as my best friend... 
 Surprise! 
 Surprise! 
 Wonderful surprise, everyone. 
 Really. Well done. 
 Okay, unfortunately for us, Trish has decided to leave the house. 
 So, this is definite? 
 Yep. Seems to be. 
 Couldn't talk her out of it in the car. 
 She said her priorities have changed and she needs to move forward with her life. 
 So, she knows she doesn't have a child. 
 On an intellectual level, yes, but she has to keep reminding herself on an emotional level. 
 How does she do that? 
 Trish has learned some strategies in therapy to help manage the illusion. 
 She'll snap a rubber band on her wrist, among other things. 
 The anti-psychotic medication has also been quite effective. 
 Her long term prognosis could be good. 
 And short term? 
 That's hard to say. 
 Methamphetamine psychosis, which is what she's currently suffering from, can last up to a year or more in some cases. 
 There may also be an underlying mental health condition that's a contributing factor, but at this point that's impossible to determine. 
 The thought of her leaving... I can't... 
 We really think she's going to take her meds and go to therapy? 
 No way! The minute she walks out that door she's going to go and get high. 
 This sucks. 
 Trish assured me the she has no plans to use. 
 She just can't be here. 
 But she needs us. 
 She can't leave, not now. 
 She has to be here. You've got to stop her. 
 Wish I could. Really, I do. 
 It just doesn't work that way. 
 Trish is here voluntarily. 
 I'm going to go talk to her. 
 Lovely to meet you both. 
 Now, why don't we head to my office so we can have a chat and go over... 
 I can't stay. 
 Oh, well, not a problem. 
 I'm sure we'll see you back her soon enough. 
 Family day is next week, after all. 
 If you could contact my wife regarding that, I'd appreciate it. 
 She'll be our family point person from now on. 
 Thank you. 
 Good-bye, Rebecca. 
 Bye, Dad. 
 Right, let's, uh, get your things. 
 Now that we are done with the paperwork, just a couple of house rules to go over. 
 Can't wait to here 'em. 
 Right. 
 You can only leave for scheduled group activities for the first week. 
 And after that, curfew is strictly enforced. 
 You'll be on kitchen clean-up for the rest of this month, and on Sunday... 
 You realize how futile this is, right? 
 Pardon? 
 The Twelve Steps? They don't work. 
 Almost everyone relapses. I'm sure you've seen the statistics. 
 What you do? Total waste of time. 
 Yeah. 
 Wow, yeah. You might be right. 
 But how I choose to potentially waste or not waste my time is completely up to me. 
 Correct? 
 I guess. 
 Good. Glad we're in agreement. 
 You're also aware of the fact that you have choices, yes? 
 Yeah. 
 Great. 
 Perfect. So, here's the deal. 
 You can choose to give up. 
 You can think of yourself as a statistic. 
 You can plan your relapse now before we even get started, if you like. 
 Or you can choose to see all of this as an opportunity. 
 You can think of yourself as somebody who'll never play by the rules of statistics again. 
 You can plan your great future, not your sad relapse. 
 It is entirely up to you. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I have faith in you. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 It's just I feel kind of guilty. 
 I'm drinking wine and my daughter's living in a sober house. 
 Don't feel guilty. It was really brave of you to open up today. 
 How do you feel? 
 Less empowered than I hoped I would. 
 You know, I really get what you're going through. 
 I really get what's it's like having a teen in recovery. 
 My son's a little older than Maddie, but he's been struggling with addiction since he was 15. 
 Sorry. It must be hard. 
 It's no harder than what other people are going through. 
 Took me awhile to even realize he had a problem. 
 He was using, dealing. 
 It was a lot. 
 How's he doing now? 
 He's using again, rejecting help. His classic pattern. 
 I blamed myself for all of it for way too long. 
 Now the only stuff that I take responsibility for is my part. 
 What I've done. You know what I mean? 
 I, uh... definitely. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 So... 
 I missed you. 
 It's really good to see you. 
 I'd offer to help you with packing... but I don't want you to leave. 
 No one does. 
 It's honestly so boring without you. 
 I've been beating everyone at Ping Pong without a worthy opponent. 
 And there isn't anyone else in here who understands how great reality shows are. 
 When I watch them with Vern, it's just... 
 You don't get it. 
 I'm leaving because of you. 
 This is all your fault. 
 I hate you. 
 Okay. I'm not sure what... 
 How could you do that to me? 
 I honestly don't know what I... 
 The pill, Maddie. The pill. 
 There were only two things I had in this world, two things... my little girl and my sobriety. 
 And one of them... 
 Well, I never really had the one thing. 
 But I did have my sobriety. 
 I was really proud of that. 
 Then you gave me that pill. 
 I really just wanted to help. 
 It wasn't even a real Xanax. 
 It was an antacid. It was a placebo effect just for you to calm down. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. 
 Craig already told me. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I took the pill, Maddie. 
 I thought it was real. 
 My sponsor says that it doesn't count. 
 Craig says that it doesn't count. 
 But me? I say that it does count. 
 And now... 
 I'm back to day one. 
 You ruined everything. 
 Please. 
 Just go away. 
 Can I please have a moment with Craig in private? 
 Nope. Not going to happen. 
 You told him. 
 No. No, of course not. 
 It wasn't really hard to put two and two together. 
 Please, just give us a second. 
 Seriously, not going to happen. 
 I am never leaving you two alone ever again. 
 Five minutes tops. 
 So, I'm sorry about the Paul thing. 
 And the Vern thing. Everything just got out of hand. 
 It was out of hand well before today and we both know it. 
 Yeah, that's true, but can't we just talk about it? 
 Let's just figure this out. 
 Cynthia, I met your fiancé today. 
 I looked him in the eye, shook his hand. 
 He's not an abstraction to me anymore. He's real. 
 He is the man you're marrying. 
 I care about you, Craig. 
 Yeah. 
 We have to stop. 
 We can't continue seeing each other. It isn't right. 
 Hey. 
 It's high time I took some accountability for my role in all this. 
 Yeah, okay, fine. 
 Funny cat videos do make things a little better. 
 See? I told you. 
 You ever feel like your head's going to explode because life is this huge jigsaw puzzle and none of the pieces are fitting together, nothing makes sense. 
 You don't know what to do or who to believe and you just want to take a really long-ass nap. 
 You ever feel that way? 
 Well, I'm partial to naps, so, yes. 
 Okay. 
 (laughing) 
 Yeah, hey. Could you give us a minute? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Thanks. 
 Rebecca : Hey. 
 So, Trish hates me. 
 I just tried to get her to stay and she told me that I'm the reason she's leaving. 
 Hey, don't take that to heart. 
 She's hurting so much right now. 
 She was just lashing out. 
 This is really bad. 
 It's awful for Trish. 
 It is, but it has absolutely nothing to do with you. 
 She's really mad and she's just projecting. 
 People do it all the time. 
 I sure have. 
 To say this feels great is... there aren't even really any words to describe it. 
 There was a point not too long ago... 
 30 days ago to be precise, when this didn't seem possible. 
 I'd given up. 
 I really had. 
 But someone had faith in me, and I'm so grateful that he did. 
 And I'm doing so much better, but I still want to rip my hair out some days. 
 And I'm still really angry... angry at the people who did this to me, like my ex-best friend. 
 I just really hate her with every ounce of my being. 
 Hey. Well done. Well done, Rebecca. 
 Really, you're making tremendous strides, and we're all very, very proud of you. 
 And I think you're about ready to start working on letting some of that anger go. 
 That anger was only hurting me. 
 I was so mad, and I blamed you for so many things that had absolutely nothing to do with you. 
 And that wasn't okay. It really wasn't. 
 And I'm so glad you forgave me. 
 Do you know how amazing it is to have my best friend back? 
 Oh, you know, I don't know. 
 It's only just... it's okay for me. 
 Hey, come here. 
 So, I've been doing a lot of thinking about this and I realized that I've been Craig. 
 And I've been Paul. 
 I've been the other man and the boyfriend who got cheated on, and the thing is, somebody always gets hurt. 
 Do you think I don't know that? 
 I think you're paralyzed by it. 
 Do you remember what you told John when you found out he was cheating on me? 
 No, that was so long ago. 
 Well, lucky or unlucky for you, I do. 
 You told him he just needed to rip that Band-Aid off and make a decision. 
 The irony. 
 My own words coming back to bite me in the ass. 
 It was good advice then. 
 It is now. 
 The other thing that you said to him was... 
 That I wouldn't respect him until he did it, ripped it off. 
 Yep. 
 Paul, hi. 
 I just wanted to let you know that I am on the way home. 
 Oh, okay. Do you mind waiting up for me? 
 There's something I need to talk to you about. 
 Margarita : Trish! 
 Where's my towel? 
 Hmm? 
 I know you took it, and if you're leaving, I want it back. 
 I don't have your damn towel. 
 Yeah, well, I don't believe you. 
 Wait, that's not cool. 
 I'm trying to be organized with... 
 Wait, you know I don't have your towel. 
 You're just using this as a lame excuse to come in here and try to convince me to stay. 
 But guess what. It's not going to happen. 
 Doesn't matter to me if you stay or if you go. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 Oh. 
 But I think you're being stupid. 
 Why? 
 You... you have such... a wonderful opportunity to do everything right before you have a child. 
 You don't have to apologize to the one you neglected. 
 You get to be the best version of you before you bring life into this world. 
 And you're not seeing that? 
 That's what makes you stupid. 
 I just... 
 I miss my little girl. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 I really, really miss her. 
 And I've missed you. 
 So you're not going anywhere, you hear? 
 You stay sober for me. 
 Thanks again for dinner. 
 It was nice. 
 We should do it again soon. 
 I'd love that. 
 I'm going to tell Maddie. 
 I have to. 
 That's good. 
 It's good you're going to be honest with her. 
 Yeah, she might hate me and not talk to me for awhile, but... 
 I need to take responsibility for my part, right? 
 Right. 
 Hey, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie. 
 Wait up. Wait up. 
 Look... 
 I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Harper. 
 It's cool. It's really cool. 
 I should never... 
 I'm sorry for following you. 
 Being worried is no excuse. 
 Really, it was not my finest moment. 
 It's all good, okay? 
 Really. 
 Hey, you're still here. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, no, not exactly. But it will be. 
 Good night, guys. 
 Good night. 
 So, that thing you said earlier about us not being as close as you thought? 
 It's not true... for me, anyway. 
 Cool. 
 It's not for me, either. 
 Good. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 What? 
 What? What is it? 
 What? 
 I thought someone had my back who doesn't and I've got to go do something. 
 So, will you cover for me with Craig? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Thanks. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, Donna Marie, hi. 
 It entirely slipped my mind that I had called you. 
 My apologies for having you come over here today and for being a bit of an alarmist. 
 It's late, you should get... 
 You weren't being an alarmist. 
 Look at what I found.
