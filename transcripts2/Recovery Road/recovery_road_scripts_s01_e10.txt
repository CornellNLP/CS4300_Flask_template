 Previously on Recovery Road... 
 Hi. I'm Maddie. 
 You're supposed to say you're an alcoholic. 
 I'm... Maddie. 
 Fool House, the reality show. 
 I've seen every season of this show, so I know exactly what they want. 
 This isn't water. 
 No, it's not. It's vodka. 
 Maddie : She knows she doesn't have a child? 
 Trish has learned some strategies in therapy to help manage the delusion. 
 She'll snap a rubber band on her wrist, among other things. 
 Maddie : It's Diesel. He's a drug dealer. 
 I know you guys took someone out. 
 That didn't happen. 
 You buried a gun, a gun that killed someone? 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 I don't know. Harper said we should, and I didn't know what else to do. 
 Wrereeaeally gonna missouou You guys think you're so frickin' great! 
 Just 'cause you're all clean and stuff! 
 (stammering) I have a fiancé. 
 I know you do. 
 Rebecca made some very bad decisions. 
 Maddie Graham is at Springtime Meadows with Rebecca Granger? 
 Did you know about this? 
 Donna Marie : You weren't being an alarmist. Look at what I found. 
 This is Charlotte Graham, Maddie's mom. I need your help. 
 I had them do a locker search. 
 I'm going to tell Maddie. 
 I... blacked out a couple weeks ago. 
 I have no idea what I did or where I was. 
 Maddie : Life can easily be broken down into moments... most mundane, forgettable, but occasionally, you have the ones that define you. 
 The great challenge is to know which are which. 
 EMT : Oh! What the hell are you two doing in here? 
 We're about to have s*x. What does it look like? 
 EMT : Get the hell out of here, now! 
 What? It was an emergency. 
 (giggles) 
 What'd you say your name was again? 
 Cynthia. 
 Maddie : The times you got hurt... or the times you hurt others. 
 ♪ I think I know what this is for ♪ 
 Maddie : The moments you wish like hell you could take back... 
 ♪ The light is breaking ♪ 
 I don't do that. 
 Maddie : and the ones you know that you can't. 
 I'm leaving. 
 ♪ Save me now ♪ 
♪ Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh... ♪ 
 Maddie : People use the term "defining moments" to celebrate their lives and their choices. 
 ♪ Come save me now ♪ 
 Maddie : But I've found, they are the ones that are the most terrifying. 
 ♪ Breaking ♪ 
 (theme music playing) 
 All right. Wes, congratulations on six months of sobriety. 
 Well done, Wes. 
 Good job, Wes. 
 Good. Good job. 
 Would you, uh... Would you like to say something? 
 No. I'm good. 
 Craig : Okay. 
 Uh, Maddie, congratulations on 30 days of sobriety. 
 Yeah. 
 Yes! 
 Well done, you. 
 Would, uh... Would you like to say something? 
 Yes. I would. 
 Where's Rebecca? 
 We've been over this, Maddie. 
 Rebecca left the house voluntarily, and I'm not at liberty... 
 You're lying. 
 She wouldn't do that. 
 Maddie, you need to lower your voice. 
 Oh, shut up! 
 So you're my dad now? 
 You know what? Screw this. 
 (emphatically) Sit down now! 
 (scoffs) 
 No one is more upset about Rebecca's departure than I am. 
 Okay? But being here is a choice... for most of you. 
 And we can choose to get upset and put everything at risk or we can move on. 
 We all screw up. 
 It's what we do next that really matters. 
 Hey, Cynthia, did you hear what happened? 
 Uh... 
 Rebecca left. I... 
 You... you look like ass. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 (stammering) And we'll talk about Rebecca, but I just... I need... 
 Hey. Do you think that you and I could talk for a minute? 
 Uh... I don't... really... uh... yeah. Sure. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, I need your help. 
 Uh, now's not the time, Maddie. 
 Please! 
 We have to go find Rebecca. She needs to be here. 
 I need her here. 
 If she doesn't want to be... 
 You don't understand. Just yesterday, she was telling me how happy she is, here, sober. 
 This doesn't make any sense. All right? I'm really worried. 
 You have school. 
 And a surprisingly a very, very good attendance record for someone who was caught on campus with vodka, so I will skip. 
 Please. 
 (sighs) 
 Okay. We'll take the van. Let me go grab my phone. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, and, Maddie, congrats on that 30-day sobriety. 
 It's a bigger deal than you realize. 
 Yeah, I know. I promise I do. 
 I think that maybe it's best if, um... well, at least for the next days... 
 I called off the wedding. 
 What? 
 (sighs) 
 (stammers) Please tell me you didn't... 
 Craig, I think we owe it to ourselves to find out what's going on between us. 
 (stammering) I can't. 
 There is something here, and it's... it's more than just... some bizarre sexual thing. 
 No, no. Wait. Cynthia, I can't. 
 I mean, I can't begin a relationship ending somebody else's. 
 But Paul and I obviously weren't meant to be together, otherwise, I would not feel the way that I do about you. 
 I just can't be that person, okay? 
 I... sor... sorry. I can't. 
 Craig. 
 Plea... please. 
 ♪ Or will it just remind you ♪ 
♪ We're living in a great divide? ♪ 
♪ Are you looking for the truth? ♪ 
♪ Are you looking for a sign? ♪ 
 Are you going to leave your wife? 
 I told you, I was going to. Okay? 
 I... I believe you. 
 Am I being naive? 
 Baby, it's gonna happen. 
 (whispers) Oh, my God. 
 God. (sobbing) 
 (stammering) I have to fix this. 
 I have to fix this. 
 Cynthia... 
 No. No, no. 
 Don't. 
 Hey, Vern needs to borrow the van. 
 Um, okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Craig's voice : Rebecca Granger has discharged herself from Springtime Meadows. 
 An attempt was made to convince her to stay. 
 The prohibitive articles found in her possession were a small bag of Suboxone and a box containing instruments for self-mutilation. 
 This is very serious. 
 These are two major infractions. 
 I know. I know, but please, Craig, just hear me out. 
 Why would you intentionally hurt yourself, Becks? 
 I mean, what's going on? 
 It's complicated. 
 I could try to explain it to you, but I don't think you would understand. 
 And I'll stop. I promise. Just... just hear me out. 
 And the Suboxone? 
 It helps me... 
 Well, it's not allowed, and you know it. 
 I know. I just... 
 Where did you get it? You don't have a prescription. 
 I can't say. 
 Rebecca, we need to know. 
 I got 'em from Doug. 
 Doug? 
 What? Who came in here and practically assaulted you, that Doug? 
 That night, he had accidentally taken one too many. 
 I don't do that. I'm very careful about my dosage, and so is he. 
 It was an accident, Craig. 
 Look, in order to remain a resident here, you're going to need to complete a detox. 
 No. I can't do another detox. I can't. 
 And the Suboxone helps me. 
 Just please... 
 It's against the rules, Rebecca. 
 All right. Does she need to be here? 
 Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. 
 Hey. You're tough, Rebecca. 
 Okay? 
 It's ten days. 
 We'll put you in the best possible... 
 No. 
 Hey, please. 
 Just consider. 
 No. 
 I'm leaving. 
 (phone camera clicks) 
 Craig's voice : Maddie remains in denial. 
 Maddie's voice : It appears that Maddie may have had a breakthrough today. 
 Craig's voice : Wes has been informed that a relationship with Maddie... 
 Maddie's voice : is not only ill-advised, but against the rules of the house. 
 Craig's voice : Per my initial conversation with Charlotte Graham... 
 Maddie's voice : Maddie's mother... 
 Just... hug me. 
 That's so sweet. 
 Come on, girl. 
 All right. Now we'll... 
 (door closes) 
 I'm assuming Cynthia told you that... 
 That you were the one who alerted her to Maddie's problem, asked her to search her locker? Yes, she did. 
 Charlotte : I'm guessing you think I'm a terrible mother. 
 But you have to understand I didn't have a choice. 
 (door opens) 
 Thank you. 
 (door opening) 
 Okay. Hi. 
 Maddie. 
 (sighs) Look. I know you're upset about Rebecca... 
 Oh, no. I came in here to apologize for being so emotional. 
 You were just trying to do your job. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, it's all good. 
 You sure? 
 It's all good. I'm fine. 
 (whimpers, shudders) 
 I know that I did a really dumb thing by burying the gun... 
 Yes, you did. 
 You know that's a violation of your probation, correct? 
 Which is why I'm coming clean. 
 I'm hoping that by cooperating fully, you'll understand where I'm coming from. 
 And where is your brother and your ex-girlfriend? 
 I don't know. Diesel said they ran off together. 
 When did you see Diesel? 
 I didn't... I didn't see Diesel. 
 I talked to Diesel on the telephone. 
 (sighs) 
 Take us to the site where you buried the gun. 
 It wasn't there last night, I swear. 
 Maybe you were looking in the wrong spot. 
 No. No, I wasn't. That's the spot. 
 Look. You did the right thing by coming to us. Okay? 
 You realize my fingerprints are gonna be all over that gun. 
 I understand, and as far as your probation goes, we'll alert your probation officer to your assistance in this matter. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, God. I'm so glad you're here. 
 (sighs) Listen... it was a mistake, and I'm sorry. 
 I just... 
 It's classic addicts' pattern. 
 Please, just... just give me another chance. 
 It was a bump in the road, and we can go to counseling. 
 Please. I love you so much. 
 I love you, and I know you still love me. 
 Okay? 
 (clears throat, sniffs) 
 Miss Molina, I'm afraid your failure to report Madeline Graham's substance abuse problem to myself is a serious infraction. 
 No. 
 (stammers) Don't do that. Uh-uh. 
 I'm afraid I'm going to need your resignation by the end of the day. 
 I brought some boxes for your belongings. 
 (scoffs) Are you kidding me? 
 No, I'm afraid I'm not. 
 Oh! 
 God! You son of a bitch! 
 And you are a whore. 
 (whimpers) 
 I strongly advise you don't repeat my last comment. 
 I'll just deny it. 
 (sobs softly) 
 I can lie too, Cynthia. 
 (door closes) 
 (panting) 
 (sobs) 
 (sobs) No. 
 I still feel really bad about what happened last time I saw you guys. 
 But, uh, I can assure you that I'm fine now. 
 Really. 
 That's good, buddy. 
 (chuckles) 
 Where's Rebecca? 
 I know that it was you giving her the Suboxone. 
 Where is she? 
 (sighs) 
 She came by here last night. 
 She told me what happened, and she didn't have anywhere else to go. 
 You have to understand, Rebecca is... 
 I know who Rebecca is. 
 I know her better than anyone in the whole world. 
 Now please just tell me, where did she go? 
 She said she wanted to start over. 
 She went to the East Coast. 
 She wasn't sure where. She just wanted to get far away from here. 
 Mm. 
 So I gave her some money for a bus ticket. 
 I just felt bad about... 
 Thank you. 
 She said she'd call me when she got settled. 
 I can have her call you or give her your number. 
 She has it. 
 (sighs) 
 Thank you. 
 So, I'll pick you up after school. 
 Just text me. Oh! My phone is dead. 
 That's fine. I'll figure something out. 
 I'll get a ride. It's okay. 
 Okay. 
 Well... 
 Hey, look at me. 
 Yeah. 
 Chin up. All right? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know what's going to happen next. 
 I mean, what if I don't stay sober? 
 Are you contemplating using? 
 I'm not contemplating anything right now, except where I'm going to be sleeping tonight. 
 Oh, you can stay here. Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, there's this place, it's where I've been going. 
 It's really different from AA, but it's helped me a lot. 
 If you want to come with me to a meeting... 
 Yeah, sure. 
 They have... some rules like, uh, about how you dress and how you share. 
 If you're cool with that. 
 I'm cool with that. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hi, Maddie. I'm glad to see you. 
 We're glad you're here. 
 Um... tell her. 
 Oh, we've already talked about the whole Zack thing. 
 I mean... 
 It's not that. It's something else. 
 Okay. 
 Remember the Thursday night you lost your car and I told you I didn't know where it was? 
 I lied. 
 What? What are you talking about, Nyla? What do you mean? 
 I felt bad that I let you drive drunk, so I pretended not to know. 
 Maddie, I'm so sorry. Okay? 
 Maddie. Maddie. 
 I thought it was better that you didn't... 
 No, you don't! 
 Stop. 
 You knew this whole time and you didn't even tell me! 
 Okay? Nyla, how could you? 
 No. Don't. 
 What happened that night, it's way worse than you think. 
 You called me afterwards, and you were so messed up, and I'm so sorry. I was trying to protect you. 
 Please, please... 
 Don't ever speak to me again! 
 Maddie. 
 Hey. 
 Wanna talk? 
 Or not talk? 
 Talk about how we don't want to talk about all the things we don't want to talk about? 
 Not talk. 
 (sighs) 
 (doorbell) 
 (doorbell continues) 
 I guess I'll get the door! 
 (doorbell continues) 
 Hi! I'm looking for Trish Tomlinson. 
 Uh... Trish? 
 Yeah? 
 Monica : There you are! 
 Trish, I'm Monica Gerstenblatt,  executive producer of Fool House,  and girlfriend, I have a very important question to ask you. 
 How would you like to come and live with us at the Fool House? 
 Wait, you're joking, right? 
 No, I'm not. It's exciting, isn't it? 
 Yeah, um... 
 Good! Yes! 
 So, I want to see that excitement. 
 All right? I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna come back in, and we're gonna do this all over again, but I want to see big energy. Big energy, okay? 
 All right! 
 Okay. 
 All right, come on, guys! Come on! 
 Move it! Move it! Can't waste time. 
 I want to see big energy all right? Come on. 
 Trish, I really don't think... 
 Vern. 
 Back that ass up. 
 Matter of fact, go over there. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Does this mean what I think? 
 Oh, my God, am I gonna be a fool? 
 Like, on Fool House? 
 (screams) 
 (giggles) 
 You and my mom both need to... 
 Cynthia? 
 (groans) 
 Are you okay? 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Okay, okay. 
 (groans) 
 (groans) 
 You're my sponsor. 
 Why are you doing this to me? 
 I suck, Maddie. 
 I really suck. 
 Shh. 
 I've hurt so many people... 
 Paul and Craig... 
 Ethan! 
 Okay, I'm gonna call Craig. 
 No! Don't call Craig! 
 He hates me! 
 He'll know what to do. 
 Maddie, Maddie, don't call Craig. 
 I don't want him to see me like this. 
 Okay, well, then who can I call? 
 I promise I'll do better. All right? Okay? 
 Who can I call? 
 I don't know. 
 Cynthia? Cynthia? Who can I call? 
 Who's your sponsor? 
 I don't have a sponsor. 
 You don't have a sponsor. 
 No. 
 You don't have a sponsor. 
 And I suck. 
 Okay. Um... 
 Call Gina. 
 Yeah. 
 Gina. 
 (groans) 
 She's not in there! 
 Where are you going? 
 Sorry. No. She's not in there. 
 Okay? 
 Sorry. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 (phone ringing) 
 Come on, come on. 
 Please, please pick up. 
 Please. 
 (receiver clicks) 
 Gina: Cynthia? 
 No, this is Maddie. Is this... is this Gina? 
 This is Gina. Is Cynthia okay? 
 No. Uh, she's drunk. 
 Okay. 
 She's drunk for the first time in 12 years, all right? 
 She needs help. 
 Wow, 12 years. 
 I never thought she'd be able to... 
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't say that. 
 I'm... I'm her sponsee. 
 I'm only 30 days sober. 
 Uh... 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I'm at Parsons-Bell Academy, where she works. 
 Can you please come here? 
 Where is that? 
 It's in Valencia. 
 California? 
 Yes, California. 
 Sweetheart, I'm in Miami. 
 I was Cynthia's sponsor, but I haven't seen her in a very long time. 
 Do you know who her current sponsor is? 
 No, she doesn't have one. 
 Ever classic Cynthia. 
 Okay, here's what you need to do. 
 Call someone you trust. 
 Yeah, well, I don't... I don't trust anybody right now. 
 Okay? 
 And I don't know what to do. 
 Okay. Maddie, calm down. 
 I'm gonna get you the name of som... 
 No, never mind. You know what? 
 I'll figure this out myself. 
 I'll figure it out myself. 
 Okay. 
 Vern's voice-mail : Aloha, friends and family. 
 This is Vern. 
 Come on, come on, Wes. 
 (ringing) 
 Please. 
 Operator : You have reached the voice-mail of... 
 Wes : Wesley Stewart. 
 (sighs) 
 (receiver clicks) 
 Uh... hey, Mom. 
 It's me. 
 I need your help. 
 Okay, Trish, you won't listen to us, so maybe you'll listen to your sponsor. 
 Go ahead. Tell her. 
 I think this is a bad... 
 This is a terrible idea! 
 Yes. 
 Okay? 
 This reality show loads people up with alcohol and gets them to do and say horrible things! 
 Embarrassing things! 
 Tell her! 
 I... I... 
 And you... of course they're gonna use you! 
 They're gonna have you relapse on national television to get ratings! To humiliate you! 
 Vern's right. 
 See? I'm right! 
 Tell her I'm right! And you know what else? 
 You're gonna go right back to where you started. 
 You guys, this is my dream! 
 I have a chance to win $300,000! 
 I'll come back. 
 I promise. 
 But you don't understand, sweetie. 
 You're in a very fragile state. 
 You need to be surrounded by people who love you, not people trying to tear you down to win some silly prize. 
 Can't you guys just be happy for me? 
 Will you do me a favor? 
 If they ask you to do something you're uncomfortable with, you say no and you come back here. 
 Okay? 
 You're too good for that. 
 You leave the show and you come back to us and we will embrace you with open arms. 
 And while you're gone, we'll miss you. 
 A lot. Like... like a lot, lot. 
 But we'll watch, and we'll cheer you on, and we'll pray for you every day, okay? 
 Because we love you. 
 We got some incredible B-roll of the house, girlfriend. 
 Are you as excited about this as we are? 
 Yep! (laughs) 
 $300,000 here I come. 
 Exactly! 
 Now, we're gonna have a car sent for you in the morning, and I'll make sure that everything is taken care of. 
 Actually, I think it might be best if I can leave with you now. 
 Is it okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Um... I'm gonna get some of my things from the bathroom and I'll be back. 
 Listen, listen, I want to talk to you. 
 She's not gonna make it. 
 I... I mean, she's... 
 Shut up, Maureen. 
 (sighs) 
 Cynthia. 
 (groans) 
 It's me, Charlotte. 
 We're gonna get you... (grunts) out of here. 
 (groans) 
 Okay? I pulled the car up as close as I could get it, all right? 
 But we're gonna have to do some walking. 
 Do you think you could do that? 
 No, I just wanna sleep. 
 And... and you'll be able to do that in just a few minutes. 
 Would you like to spend the night with me? 
 Huh? 
 I'll make you dinner and we can... stay up... and talk. 
 No! 
 It'll be like a slumber party. 
 It just... Paul and... we... Craig and... 
 Okay, we're gonna talk all about it... 
 I can't. 
 But first, we're gonna get you in the car. 
 Okay? 
 Craig hates me. 
 You probably hate me. 
 You do hate me. 
 Don't be stupid, Cynthia. 
 I don't hate you. Now pull it together, bitch. 
 No, I'm just gonna take a nap. 
 (groans) 
 (sighs) How's your upper body strength? 
 Why is she so... 
 She's having a heat stroke. 
 We're taking her to the hospital. 
 All right. 
 Ma, it's not even hot out. 
 Okay... 
 (groans) 
 Oh! 
 (groans) 
 Turn around. 
 Her elbow hit me! 
 (grunts) 
 Jeez, Mom! 
 Whoa! 
 (sighs) 
 Okay. 
 Okay, here we go. 
 Careful of her head. 
 And mine. 
 Gosh, Cynthia. 
 Hey, that was pretty impressive. 
 (sighs) 
 Thank you. 
 (chuckles) 
 Maddie, I need to... 
 We call that being of service. 
 In the program. 
 Sometimes you just, you know, have to help someone who needs it... even with brute strength. 
 Sometimes we even drag them kicking and screaming. 
 And sometimes we even use deceit. 
 But sometimes... we just have to get the person in the car. 
 Okay. 
 Oh! 
 Oh... What are you... what are you doing? 
 No, no, no, no, no! You... Okay. 
 That's gross. 
 All right, so go have a slumber party with my sponsor, because that's not weird. 
 All right... Oops. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna take her keys. 
 Correction. I'm gonna take her car. 
 She can have it back when she's completed 90 days of sobriety. 
 Can I just... 
 How are you feeling? 
 (groans) 
 Oh, thanks. 
 (groans) 
 12 years. 
 I had 12 years. 
 And you'll have many, many more to go. 
 Yeah. 
 God. 
 I've hurt so many people. 
 I... I... I can't be here. 
 I... one relapse after another. 
 There's just too many memories. 
 I... 
 Cynthia! 
 Take a breath. 
 Falling down is part of recovery. 
 It's part of life. 
 I... I... I can't do this here. 
 I... I need a fresh start. 
 I'm moving to California. 
 Oh, a geographic. 
 Honey, you know this don't work. 
 Look what happened to Miranda. 
 Or Kevin. 
 Our problem follows us. 
 Wherever you go... there you are. 
 I have to. 
 I need a fresh start. 
 Alone. 
 What do you mean "alone"? 
 What about Ethan? 
 Cynthia! 
 What about Ethan? 
 I can't. 
 All hail the conquering hero. 
 You won? That's great, baby. 
 Oh! Ick. You're sweaty. 
 Yes. Why, yes I am, Mom. 
 Maybe a little bloody too. 
 Icky-ky. 
 Why are you looking at airfare? 
 I have to go to California. 
 It's your mother. 
 She's not... is she... 
 Oh! No, baby. 
 She's okay. 
 Can I come? 
 If you'd like to. 
 I need to apologize. 
 I think I've been a little tough on you. 
 You don't need to make any apologies. 
 I was your daughter's sponsor, and she found me drunk. 
 But yeah, by the way, I've been sponsoring Maddie. 
 Secretly. 
 I know. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 You encouraged her. 
 You empowered her. 
 You gave her the support I didn't know how to, so I will always be grateful for that. 
 You're a good mom. 
 I'm gonna be. I'm learning. 
 You said to me a couple of weeks ago that I didn't know what it was like to be a mother. 
 You're right, I don't. 
 But I have a son. 
 And I was a terrible mother, so I... 
 I... I think that's another story for a... another time. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 (sighs) 
 What do you mean she left? 
 And you let her? 
 Mrs. Granger, Rebecca is an adult. 
 She doesn't need permission to discharge herself. 
 The contract I signed said that we were to be notified immediately. 
 Yes, but it all happened rather abruptly I'm afraid. 
 (emphatically) Where is my daughter? 
 (emphatically) Regrettably, I don't know. 
 Then you need to find her. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 With all due respect now, this is the first time you've ever even been here, so excuse me if I seem a little befuddled by the sudden interest in your daughter's whereabouts, or for that matter, well being. 
 Let me explain something to you. 
 There seems to be this misconception that my husband is this powerful man in our community and that I am this dutiful wife who cowers in his shadow with a smile on my face. 
 Well, let me be clear. 
 Everything my husband has is because of me. 
 Everything my family has is because of me. 
 Dr. Marcus Granger is not to be feared. 
 I am. 
 Now, unless you find my daughter in the next 48 hours, I will systematically erase this dump from existence, brick by brick. 
 And then I will make sure that you never work again. 
 (scoffs) 
 Wow. 
 I need you to please leave. 
 You have 48 hours. 
 Get the hell out of my house right now. 
 You've made a horrible mistake. 
 (door opens)

 Maddie the morbid mortician meditates in... 
 I'm really sorry. I... 
 No, it's... it's okay. 
 Dad, this is Wes. Wes, this is my dad. 
 I realized something today. 
 We were here a couple of weeks ago and I didn't even... come to my father's grave. 
 Who even does that? 
 Maddie, it was a weird day. 
 We were both in a different headspace. 
 Don't read too much into it. 
 And I have been so self-centered and self-absorbed. 
 No, you haven't. 
 Quite the opposite. 
 Trish, Rebecca, me. 
 Yeah, well Trish hates me, Rebecca's gonna, and you... 
 I'm here. 
 Yes, you are here. 
 I don't know if I'm a virgin. 
 I mean... 
 I may have had s*x during a blackout, but I don't know, and I found out today that my friend, who said she didn't know, actually probably does know if I did or didn't. 
 I went to go talk to my sponsor, but she was wasted... and I couldn't find Rebecca. 
 I think she's gone. 
 I wonder if I'll ever see her again and I... 
 God, I like you, Wes. 
 Like, I... I really like you. 
 I'm on probation. 
 Minor drug offense. 
 But today I lied to the police. 
 I told them I hadn't seen Diesel 'cause it would have been a violation of my probation because he's a known felon, and I'm not allowed to consort with felons. 
 And I really, really like you too, Maddie. 
 Like, I really like you.

 We're not supposed to be together. 
 I know. 
 We can't tell anybody. 
 No, I... I know. 
 I know. 
 We lost two people today. 
 Sucks. 
 Bad choices. 
 Oh, is that some kind of dig at me? 
 Dude, you need to relax. 
 I'm not even talking about you. 
 We are still here. 
 Okay? 
 All of us. 
 Committed to our... 
 Yes. 
 We're still here. 
 (door opens) 
 Hey... everyone. 
 I have something I want to tell you. 
 Yeah, Maddie, now is really... 
 Wes : No, dude. 
 Really. Let... let her talk. Really. 
 Today's been a pretty awful day... and I have dealt with things that I didn't want to deal with. 
 And guess what? 
 I wanted to drink. 
 And smoke a joint. 
 And pop some pills. 
 And do a line. 
 I wanted to take anything... because I wanted to make it all go away. 
 But I didn't. 
 Yeah, so it was a really bad day, (sighs) but... it was also a really good day because I didn't use. 
 And I... I realized something... and I wanted to share it with you all. 
 Um... okay. 
 Hi. 
 My name is Maddie... and I am an alcoholic. 
 All : Oh. Maddie, wow. 
 Oh, my... 
 Way to go, Maddie.

 (overlapping chatter) 
 Wesley Stuart. 
 Uh, yeah. Wes? Wes? 
 We're looking for Wesley Stuart. 
 Yeah, that's me. 
 Wesley Stuart, you are under arrest for the murder of Keith Wallace. 
 I already told the police everything I know. 
 You just keep quiet. What... what's going on? 
 What... what's going on? 
 I can vouch for his innocence. He's my sponsee. 
 I knew this was gonna happen. 
 All right, will somebody please tell me what's going on here? 
 They told me there was no dead pharmacist. 
 Wes. 
 What's going on here? 
 If you can't afford one, one will be appointed to you. 
 I don't even know who Keith Wallace is, okay? 
 Maybe you know him by his street name? Goes by Diesel. 
 No, it's okay! 
 Diesel's dead? 
 Everything's gonna be okay, all right? 
 Everything's gonna be fine! 
 Just find Harper and find Asa, okay? 
 Everything's gonna be fine!
