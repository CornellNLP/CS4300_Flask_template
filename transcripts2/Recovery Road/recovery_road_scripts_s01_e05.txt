 Previously on "Recovery Road"... 
 Hey, bae! Why did you come to school with the guidance counselor? 
 We are both on Maddie's side, right? 
 I miss you. 
 I miss you, too. 
 I just feel so cut off from everyone. 
 I don't think I would pull my child away from the help she needs and take her home with me just because I was a little lonely. 
 How's Maddie doing? 
 She's not taking it seriously. 
 I do have a group of friends who have sustained me through some pretty tough times. 
 Just dinner with Zach. We won't drink. 
 A small party in a hotel suite. 
 And you're going to stay sober? 
 I find your complete lack of confidence in me highly disruptive to my sobriety. 
 Was she his girlfriend? 
 Harper : They made me call him. 
 He owed them money. 
 Who was he? 
 Nobody. 
 I woke up in lockup. 
 They told me I stabbed my cheating husband four times. 
 I just want my little girl back. 
 You can start waiting tables at Margarita's. 
 Maddie's voice : I don't know when it was that we began to lose control. 
 Was there a specific moment when it all started to turn? 
 Or did it unravel little by little until there was nothing left and the Earth tilted off its axis and we were hurled out into the darkness of the unknown world? 
 The vacuous space, the intolerable nothing, yet we still try to carry on. 
 Gael : What the hell are you doing? 
 You think I'm stupid, don't you? 
 You think I don't know what you did, but I know, and I know everything. 
 You're not making any sense. 
 There's meth in the floor, and it's in the walls. Look. 
 Look. Look what I found in the wall. 
 You're hiding it everywhere. 
 That's the insulation. 
 Okay? That's fiberglass. 
 No. Stop lying! You're always... 
 God damn it! You always cheating me! 
 Hey! Shh, shh. Baby, come on. 
 We smoked the last of it already. 
 I'm going to hook up with Twitch in an hour to get us another teener. 
 No. You hid it from me. 
 You've been up for three days, okay? 
 You need to sleep a little. 
 I love you, baby. 
 Maddie. It's time to wake up. 
 Come on, Sleeping Beauty. 
 Bite me. 
 How can you stay in bed on a day like today? 
 Today is my first day at work. 
 I'm going to be able to pay my lawyer and get my little boo back. 
 I cannot wait for you to meet her. 
 She is the cutest thing in the world. 
 Maddie! Are you even listening to me? 
 Come on, you got to get up. 
 Do you like my slap bracelet? 
 Is it too old-school or cool old-school? 
 I can never tell. 
 Trish! 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm getting ready for work. Don't I look nice? 
 Come now. We got group before we go. 
 I can't wake up Maddie. 
 (groans) 
 That's how you wake up a teenager. 
 Good morning! 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Animal Farm. 
 I'm going to invite you all to go into the basket and pick out a different animal to represent each member of your immediate family. 
 (groaning) 
 Now, now, come on, guys. 
 (squeaks) 
 So, I'm the cat, because I like to sleep all day and sit on the couch and watch TV. 
 Did you know that cats actually do watch TV? 
 It's a thing. 
 Huh! 
 So, I'm the squirrel and my mom is the cat, because I don't care. 
 (growling) 
 (sighing) 
 And that's my husband. 
 It is interesting how you put them in order like that. 
 It's kind of militaristic. 
 They all work at my restaurant. 
 And that's your husband? 
 Why is he the teeny tiny turtle? 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 Hey. There are no phones in group, you know that. 
 Sorry. 
 Wes, go ahead and pick out your family. 
 There is no way in hell I'm doing that. 
 Excuse me? 
 I said I'm not doing it. 
 (theme music playing) 
 ♪ This time is my time, so step aside ♪ 
 Glover. 
 This is Trish, our new waitress. 
 Trish, this is my son Glover. 
 Hey. 
 Okay, you'll be training her. 
 Okay, get going. 
 And make sure you put the silverware on top of the napkins this time. 
 No one wants to eat with a fork that's been sitting on the table. 
 Mom's got a system for everything. 
 But... you learn to get used to it. 
 I'm going to be really good at this job. 
 I can just feel it. 
 Have you waited tables before? 
 No. 
 Oh. 
 Well, where have you worked? 
 I went to college for a little bit, but then I became a crystal meth addict, so you know how that goes. 
 Anyway, then I lost custody of my daughter, so that's why I really need this job. 
 Well, good. 
 But just a piece of advice, you might want to keep that to yourself when my dad comes in. 
 Wait, your dad is alive? 
 I thought your mom killed him. 
 Wait, what? 
 No, she just stabbed him a few times. 
 Oh. 
 So what is she always worrying about? 
 You know, all my friends are going to the beach today. 
 I mean all of them, and I'm stuck here with you on a Sunday alone with the cleaning crew. 
 You've been to enough AA meetings at this point. 
 What's the thing they say at the end? 
 The Serenity Prayer? 
 No, after that. 
 "Keep coming back." 
 And then after that? 
 "It works if you work it"? 
 Yes! 
 Ding, ding, ding! That's right! 
 It works if you work it, and only if you work it. 
 So you need to start working it. 
 I am. 
 What do you think I'm doing? 
 All right. 
 So, what step are you on? 
 Step? 
 Yes. 
 You are aware that Alcoholics Anonymous is based on something called "the 12 Steps." 
 I don't like sarcasm on you. That's my thing. 
 Maddie, part of the deal we made was that you were going to do the work and take it seriously. 
 You really need to start working the steps, and you really need to choose a sponsor. 
 Sponsor? I... 
 I talked it over with Craig, and we both agree you need to choose a sponsor by the end of the week so you can start working the steps. 
 Fine. 
 Then why don't you do it? 
 Me? You want me to be your sponsor? 
 Sure. 
 Wow. 
 Maddie, I am really touched. 
 Great. 
 Yes. 
 So, start with step one. 
 Go ahead and write out a list of all the ways that you feel your life has become unmanageable. 
 Oh, my God, there's sober homework. 
 Of course. And here is a copy of the Big Book, the Twelve and Twelve, As Bill Sees It, daily meditations. 
 Oh, this is a great list of sober bloggers. 
 The one about the sober dog? Awesome. 
 Okay, and then just roll? 
 Yeah, roll it. Make it tight. 
 Okay. 
 It's all right. 
 Hey, son. 
 Hey, Pops. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 And who are you? 
 Oh, you must be the turtle. 
 The what? 
 Hi, I'm Trish. 
 I'm the new waitress. 
 Margarita used to be my roommate at Springtime Meadows... only until she asked Craig to move her because I snore. 
 But I like my new roommate, too, though. 
 She's really nice, good hygiene, and she's never even tried crystal. 
 Uh-huh. 
 What the hell are you doing bringing some crazy girl from your rehab down here to work in our restaurant? 
 My restaurant. 
 She here because I want her here. 
 End of discussion. 
 I can't. 
 You took away my ability to feel anything but anger and contempt. 
 Don't speak that way, my love. 
 This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. 
 Yeah, this is the one where Sebastiano tells Constance that he has terminal cancer, and she tells him that his ex-wife was a serial killer. 
 Constance : My father! 
 Weird. 
 Constance : He was the only family I had left. 
 Well, he's lying about the cancer. 
 (TV turns off) 
 Someone who lived here before must have really liked this show because they taped, like, seriously, every episode. 
 And there are thousands. 
 Ugh. 
 Tell me this isn't as good as it gets in sobriety. 
 You're not having a good time? 
 No. I mean, I like hanging out with you, but it's Sunday, and instead of doing something fun, we're sitting here in a basement watching Storms of the Heart, and you've already seen this episode. 
 How was the party? 
 It sucked. All my friends were wasted and I wasn't. 
 And after going all Jonestown massacre on my own ass, I don't know if I'll ever be able to hang out with them again. 
 Jonestown massacre? 
 It's something my friends and I like to say when we're jonesing. 
 You know what? 
 I get how hard it is to let go of those friendships. 
 But the thing that I've found is that, honestly, those people who I thought were my friends, when I was sober, I really didn't like them that much. 
 Is that a terrible thing to say? 
 No. Not at all. 
 How long did you make it through the last time? 
 I had a pretty great six months once. 
 Six months? You weren't totally miserable for the whole time? 
 No. 
 How'd you do it? 
 I didn't drink or use for six months. 
 Oh. 
 No, but... but how? 
 I mean it. I really want to know, because right now drinking anti-freeze seems like a more viable life option. 
 Maybe mix it in with a little orange juice, some ground-up light bulbs. 
 Really put a lot of thought into this, haven't you? 
 Well, there was one thing that I used to do. 
 I used to fly these model planes. 
 We could build one if you want. 
 All right. Let's do it. Why not? 
 (rock music playing)

♪ Break up, we go away then we make up ♪ 
 Look at that.

 Well done. Your first plane. 
 This was fun. 
 My fist ever plane. 
 I feel like in this gold, right? 
 (cell phone rings) 
 I should take this. 
 Hey, Cynthia. 
 Charlotte, I'm glad I caught you. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. I just... 
 I wanted to let you know that Maddie asked me to be her sponsor this morning, and I wanted to make sure that that's fine with you. 
 Her sponsor? 
 Yeah. 
 Basically, it means I'll be taking her through the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
 Oh, yes, of course. Well, you know all about that, and you'll be a big help to her. 
 I just wanted to make sure. 
 Okay. Uh-huh. Thanks for calling. Bye. 
 I like this one. 
 You got to watch out...

 For what? 
 The trees. 
 You got to really crank the throttle coming in for landing. 
 Everything you just said sounds like a euphemism.

 Nothing.

 This is nice and all, but it isn't exactly the cathartic experience I've been looking for. 
 All right, well, you can try flying it if you want. 
 These things here. Up. 
 You move... 
 I should look up, right? 
 You got to look... 
 Here, you're going to... it's going to crash. 
 Aah! Sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 This can't have been the only thing that kept you sober for six months. 
 I mean, that's an eternity. 
 No. It wasn't the only thing. 
 Here. 
 I realize you're doing the whole mysterious, dark, brooding, whatever, loner thing, but would it kill you to be just a little bit verbose? 
 I don't know. Is that the right word? 
 Verbose works, yeah. 
 I guess I just don't like talking about it, because I messed it up so badly. 
 Messed up what? 
 The job I had those last sixth months I was sober. 
 You didn't work at the movie theater? 
 No, it was, like, a real job job. 
 I worked for a contractor building houses and furniture and all this cool stuff. 
 It was great. 
 Wow. 
 That is cool. 
 Yeah, but... 
 I would never be able to get a job like that again. 
 Not with my history. 
 Oh. 
 But I got my plane. 
 Maddie : Mom, this is Wes. 
 Wes, this is my mom. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, it's nice to meet you. 
 I mean, officially this time. 
 Yeah. 
 Please tell me we're not actually going to the beach today. 
 I can't move. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 (British accent) Let us lie here languidly like lettuce leaves. 
 Are you still drunk? 
 Mm-hmm. I think I am. 
 Do you remember the party we had last night? 
 Nope. All I know is that I feel like ass. 
 Oh, what I do recall, is I totally made out with Astrid Holloway. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh, no. 
 Devin puked on Candace's top. 
 Candace chugged a half a bottle of cough syrup. 
 Who even does that? 
 Yeah, she's an idiot. 
 She's two bad decisions away from vodka-soaked tampons. 
 Did Maddie leave with an uncle that we've never heard of and that actress who was on Misfits of Mayhem? 
 Olivia O'Brien. 
 Yeah. 
 She did do that. 
 No way. This is one of those Jim Leeno construction benches. 
 He was my old boss, the one I was telling you about. 
 You worked for Jim Leeno? 
 Yeah, he was really like a mentor to me. 
 He taught me so much. 
 That's a good mentor to have. 
 Wes is really great at building stuff. 
 So what's new at Springtime Meadows? 
 Oh, nothing much, I suppose. 
 I asked Cynthia to be my sponsor. 
 Did you? Hmm. 
 And what does that mean, exactly? 
 I don't know. 
 I guess she helps me and she gives me sober homework. 
 Sponsors take you through the steps. 
 They're the person you can talk to about anything, someone you can turn to for help or advice. 
 You can tell them everything, you know, all about the resentments you have, the people you've wronged. 
 They help you through the amends process. 
 It's pretty cool, actually. 
 So, you're going to be sharing all of that with Cynthia? 
 I mean, she's your guidance counselor. 
 She's supposed to be helping you get into college. 
 Your sponsor is your school guidance counselor? 
 That is weird. 
 Hey. 
 I got it. 
 Okay. Whew! 
 Man, this waitressing thing is a bitch. 
 Most of the time, I just snorted it. 
 I mean, I smoked it, too, but just not as much. 
 I thought you said you wanted curry rice? 
 No? Okay. 
 How about some jerked chicken? 
 Yeah, let's do this. 
 Now we got to get him his ice cream on the house, because I... you messed me up. 
 Wait, why am I telling you this? 
 Don't do drugs. 
 Why don't you just eat what you have? 
 Not what they ordered. You're wrong! 
 Okay, here you go. 
 Really, girl, I did you a favor. 
 I mean, mom jeans? Come on! 
 Don't give up on yourself. You got a few good years left. 
 Trish! 
 It's not just that she's falling behind. 
 She's deliberately disruptive. 
 She's taking time away from the other children and the work they need to be doing. 
 They're 9-year-olds. What work could possibly be so important? 
 I know how upsetting this must be. 
 But we've received several complaints from parents already. 
 Who's complaining? 
 That's not important. 
 All we want is for her to be evaluated by a district psychologist. 
 And if medication is the answer, which I strongly believe it is, then you need to be open to that if you want Trish to remain here. 
 So some psychiatrist who can't get a job anywhere else, except, of course, this highly prestigious, ranked 47th in the nation or whatever it is, California public school system, wants to spend an hour with my daughter and tell me I need to medicate her? 
 There isn't anything wrong with Trish. 
 You're the ones who are crazy. 
 You don't need to look at this as a negative. 
 Mom : I guess there is one positive thing. 
 I get a chance to tell you that you are an arrogant, self-righteous, stuck-up piece of... 
 You are the stupidest girl I ever met in my whole life. 
 What is your problem? 
 Hey, babe. Calm down. 
 Come on. 
 Can't you do anything right? 
 No wonder you can't find a job and I'm the only fool who would hire you. 
 Your daughter is lucky she don't live with you. 
 Just get out of here. 
 Now! Get out now! Go! 
 
 
 
 Thanks for introducing me to your mom. 
 She seems great. 
 She's all right, I guess. 
 The way she supports you, it's really cool. 
 I guess it is. 
 The only person I have like that is my grandma, but she's in a nursing home now. 
 I try to visit her as much as I can. 
 Is she the one who raised you? 
 I wish. She's super cool. 
 She was this draft advisor in the Vietnam war, and a civil rights activist, and this bad-ass feminist. 
 And you know the Give Peace a Chance video, with John and Yoko and Tim Leary and stuff? 
 You can actually see her on stage. 
 She's playing the tambourine. 
 No way! That's so awesome. 
 I lived with her those past six months that I was sober. 
 It's kind of the thing that made it so great, I guess. 
 Where's the nursing home now? 
 It's over on the east side. 
 Well, let's go. 
 Go where? 
 To see your grandma. 
 Right now? 
 Yeah. 
 Right now? 
 Right now! 
 You met my mom. I'll met her. 
 Come on. 
 All right. 
 This is absurd! 
 I'm not in a prison here, am I? 
 Is this Attica? 
 You going to call in Governor Rockefeller? 
 I don't even know what that means. 
 I just lost one of my best friends. 
 She's being buried this afternoon. 
 I cannot miss the funeral, and you can't keep me from going. 
 Uh, yes, ma'am, I can. 
 All right, I'm done talking to you. 
 I'd like to speak to Janine. 
 Ma'am... 
 Right now! 
 Ma'am... 
 Attica! Attica! 
 Grandma! Grandma, Grandma, Grandma. 
 Wes! 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, well... 
 Grandma, this is Maddie. 
 Maddie, this is my Grandma Jane. 
 Hi. It's nice to meet you. 
 You are so beautiful. 
 Aw, thank you. 
 So are you. 
 And look! She doesn't have track marks. 
 So glad to see your tastes are improving. 
 Thanks, Grandma. 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. She's just being weird. 
 Yeah, I know. She is. 
 Yeah. 
 But she did this in tenth grade, too. 
 Remember when she was all into Rebecca and reggae and was telling everyone she was thinking of becoming Wiccan? 
 Hmm. She didn't disappear for two whole weeks. 
 I don't know. 
 She just seems different. 
 Body snatchers. 
 Okay, you're going to think this is stupid, but when she left last night, I decided to finish her drink because... 
 Both : No booze left behind. 
 And it was water. 
 Okay. 
 Nyla, she puts vodka in her water bottle, not the other way around. 
 You are so Nancy Drew right now. 
 I'm being serious about this. 
 Remember at the movie theater, how she was? 
 What was that? 
 Oh, my God, Elle. 
 You're right! She changed! 
 Body snatchers. 
 You're a bitch. 
 I'm sure Maddie's fine, okay? 
 If anything was going on, she would have told me. 
 I'm her best friend. 
 As long as she's not going Wiccan on us, I think we can deal. 
 Hey, you didn't have to yell at that girl like that. 
 The hell I didn't. She spilled everything, got all the orders wrong, insulted the customers. 
 She embarrassed me. 
 I have to fight with you to bring her on, and this is how she repays me. 
 Did you try telling her what she was doing wrong before you started screaming at her? 
 No, she should have known. 
 Maybe you gave her to much responsibility on her first day. 
 Did you think of that? 
 I gave her a chance, but she blew it. 
 Okay, you know what? Whatever, Mom. 
 You didn't need to treat Trish like that. 
 She's really trying. 
 We don't try. We do. 
 But everybody deserves a second chance. 
 Didn't we give that to you? 
 Thank you. 
 I'm already sponsoring four other girls, and between all of them they have a total of 26 years of sobriety. 
 I know Maddie. 
 I watched her grow up. 
 I don't want to see her make the same mistakes that I did. 
 But you're engaged to the head of the school. 
 Isn't that a conflict of interest? 
 I haven't had a problem keeping the two things separate so far. 
 What makes you think this would be any different? 
 I want her to be able to come to me with any issues that she might have. 
 I don't want her talking to you about her private life. 
 It's our business. 
 Maddie's recovery depends on her being able to be open and honest. 
 Of course, and I want her to have that kind of relationship with her mother, not with her guidance counselor. 
 It's weird. 
 I'm a sober woman she looks up to. It's perfectly normal. 
 This was a huge... no, no, a monumental step for her. 
 You should be proud of the progress she's making. 
 I am proud of her, but she's still a 17-year-old girl. 
 She doesn't always know what's best for her. 
 I do. I'm her mother. 
 I can appreciate that, but you still don't know how the program works. 
 I do. We discussed this. 
 Sponsoring Maddie was never part of the deal. 
 There comes a point where you have to start letting go. 
 Have you ever thought about checking out an Al-Anon meeting? 
 Addiction is a family disease. 
 This is not my problem. I'm not the one with a problem. 
 You're exhibiting classic co-dependent behavior. 
 Cynthia, I was working when you called, and so I did not give your question the full attention that it deserved. 
 But I am now, and I am telling you that for a multitude of reasons I am absolutely not comfortable with this. 
 After she finally made a decision that might help save her life? 
 For heaven's sakes, get over yourself. 
 Fine, then I'll tell her that you said no. 
 Good. Tell her. 
 I will. 
 Good. 
 It's not like I'm asking them to let me go base-jumping off Everest. 
 It's a funeral at Bolan Cemetery. 
 Grandma, it's probably not safe for you. 
 I mean, your health. 
 So what? I'm going to live forever? 
 What's the point? 
 Some are buried, some are born. 
 One linked to the other, the great circle of life. 
 May I ask whose funeral is it? 
 And old friend from way back. 
 She died of lung cancer of all things, although she was a big pothead, so I guess it makes sense. 
 But I should really be there. This is ridiculous. 
 The prisons are overflowing, the schools are filled with students. 
 The world loves to keep things locked up. 
 It loves to throw away the key. 
 Why don't we take her? 
 Vern has my car. 
 Oh, Wes. 
 Someone in this place must have a car we can borrow. 
 Well... 
 Joe Ashby in the room next door has a car. 
 Grandpa, I missed you! 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Your granddaughter. 
 My granddaughter's 35 years old. 
 She lives in Cleveland. 
 Oh, grandpa. I'm going to borrow your car, okay? 
 My car? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thanks, Grandpa. 
 There better not be a scratch on it. 
 You get it? 
 You are a girl after my own heart. 
 Thanks. 
 Here we go. 
 We're out of here. 
 Right. 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 Oh, gosh. 
 Hi. 
 What's the story with you two? 
 We're just friends, Grandma. 
 Oh, that's a shame. 
 You need a smart girl like her. 
 And what's the matter with you? 
 You don't think my grandson's cute? 
 No, I do. 
 Grandma. 
 I just... 
 Don't cheat yourself out of too much life. 
 Everything passes away, and too soon. 
 Don't be afraid to try... to get hurt, to be human. 
 And to drive a little faster, Wes. 
 Thank you. 
 (sobbing) 
 (knock on door) 
 Just please leave, okay? 
 I get it. I can't do anything right. 
 All right, all right. Knock it off. 
 I can't. 
 What am I going to do? 
 I'm sorry! 
 I was too hard on you. 
 And if you'll come back I'll find something else for you to do, something better suited for your unique personality. 
 Thank you! 
 Thank you. 
 That He may bless and deliver all souls of the faithful departed from the pains of hell and the bottomless pit. 
 Deliver them from the lion's den, O Lord. 
 Let us pray. 
 She's really incredible. 
 Yeah. She is. 
 So what happened? Did she get sick or something? 
 No. It was my fault. 
 I was doing really great, going to meetings, working a great job, doing everything I was supposed to do. 
 The one day I opened the refrigerator and saw a bottle of her pain meds. 
 And I thought, "I've been sober six months now. 
 "You know, I've proved I can do it. 
 Taking one Percocet's not going to hurt." 
 And that was it. 
 It was like the drugs were talking to me again, telling me I'd never been happy without using, never would be. 
 So... I started shooting dope again. 
 And my grandma had a pretty bad fall, had to go into assisted living... and I went into another detox. 
 God, sorry. It's too much information. 
 You're not going back to that, are you? 
 I hope not. 
 I'm coming up on sixth months sober again. 
 Can't mess it up this time, can't pull on that loose thread. 
 I wish I could make things better for you. 
 You do. 
 You really, really do. 
 I mean, today has been great. 
 Okay, we will see you at seven. All right, thanks. 
 Thank you so much for coming in. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry about my mom. 
 Her bark is worse than her bite. 
 I... guess that's not true. 
 Still, she's making progress. 
 She's even going to anger management classes. 
 They're court-mandated, but she's taking it seriously. 
 Yeah, well, maybe she should take them a little more seriously. 
 And I also wanted to tell you that you should be really proud of yourself. 
 I know you've overcome a lot, and I've seen how hard it's been for my mom. 
 Thank you. 
 (ringing) 
 You can't tell me what to do because I'm not a child. 
 You are in no position... 
 Doesn't really matter. to care for a baby. 
 How do you know that? 
 Look at this place. 
 I am not a child. 
 Girl, come here. Come here! 
 What, are you upset because for once everything isn't about you? 
 Trish... 
 You don't know. 
 You're mad? 
 There's something wrong with you. 
 No, no. 
 We're going to get you out. 
 No one cares! 
 A psychiatrist. 
 I can't hear you. 
 We'll get you on medication. 
 Mom, you don't know everything! 
 You don't know! I'm going to have this baby on my own! 
 You'll see! I don't need you! 
 I don't need anybody. 
 Maddie : Can I tell you something stupid? 
 When I was little, I used to think that I was an alien, that I'd been dropped off on this planet by mistake, and... the reason I never felt the same as other people was because I was actually from outer space. 
 You know what? Maybe we're both from the same planet. 
 Seriously. Maybe we are, but maybe it wasn't a mistake. 
 Maybe we're supposed to find other aliens like us. 
 Seriously. 
 Maybe we are. 
 Aww. That's so sweet. 
 Look at the way she's comforting that poor man who lost his wife. 
 Oh. 
 She is, uh, really comforting him. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 This all sounds great. 
 Really. You've made your sponsor very proud. 
 Yeah, at first Margarita was really mean, but then she apologized, so I was like, "Okay, fine. 
 I'll come back to work." And then I did. 
 And she's like, "Wow! You're doing so much better at this." 
 And I'm like, "I totally am!" 
 This is so good, Trish. 
 You've started this job, you've been sober six months, you spent the afternoon with your daughter last week. 
 I'm just so happy with the progress that you're making. 
 Have you told your mom about the job yet? 
 No, but... oh, my God. 
 Do you think this means I can get more visitation rights? 
 Like, unsupervised? 
 Well, no. Probably not just yet. 
 But it's a good start. 
 You should definitely call your lawyer and let him know... 
 This is perfect. I'm going to talk to my mom about it after my shift. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Wes : Here you go, Grandma. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't you want to go live with that man you're in love with now that you can finally be together? 
 Who says I'm in love with him? 
 But you don't want to go back to this place, do you? 
 You said it's like a prison. 
 It can be, sure. 
 There's something to knowing where you belong, and this is where I belong right now. 
 Besides which, it's poker night, and that bitch Betty took me for 500 bucks last week. 
 I'm on to her now. 
 Come on, Grandma. 
 She cheats! I got her. 
 Come on. 
 What's this? 
 Ackee and saltfish. 
 Your favorite. 
 You made this for me? 
 I made this, yes. 
 Why? 
 Because you were right. 
 You gave me a second chance, and I'm grateful. 
 And... I'm sorry. 
 Hey, Maddie. 
 Sorry to come by so late, it's just... 
 Do you have a second? 
 Sure. Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 And I've got something for you. 
 Wow. 
 I am impressed. 
 I had a good day today, you know? 
 It was only one day, but still. 
 That's what sobriety is all about. 
 You can't change the past and you can't predict the future. 
 So all you've got is today. 
 It's putting those days together one day at a time that makes up a whole life. 
 I'm willing to give it a try. 
 I mean, at least for now. 
 I really proud of you, but... 
 I talked to your mom and she's not comfortable with me sponsoring you. 
 What? 
 I... I'm sorry. 
 What? Why? 
 I think maybe she feels threatened or... 
 I don't know. It's complicated. 
 But it's not up to my mom. 
 It's up to me, right? This is about me. 
 Yeah, you're right. You are totally right. 
 This is messed up. 
 Okay, how about... what if I agreed to be your temporary sponsor... until you can find someone? 
 What do you mean? For how long? 
 As long as it takes. Indefinitely. 
 We'll say that you're my interim sponsor. 
 What do you think? How does that sound? 
 Okay, I guess. 
 Good. 
 Great! Perfect! 
 Only maybe just don't tell your mom right now. 
 Fine. 
 (doorbell rings) 
 How'd you get past the gate? 
 Where's Wes? 
 Hey, do you know this guy? Is everything okay? 
 He's a dealer. 
 I'm looking for Wes. 
 Where is Craig? 
 I know he's here, all right? 
 Sorry, dude, you've got to go. 
 It's okay. Let him in. Let him in. 
 You want me to call the police? 
 No, it's okay. This is Asa. 
 He's my brother. 
 So you going to talk to me now or keep on hiding like a little bitch? 
 I'm right here. 
 Mom's back. She wants to see you. 
 Well, I don't want to see her. 
 She wants to know who has Grandma's power of attorney. 
 What for? 
 Do you know where she is? 
 No. 
 Come on, man. 
 I know you visit her. 
 You were always her favorite. 
 I don't know where she is. 
 Stop lying to me. 
 (door opens) 
 My daughter is missing! 
 She's missing! She's missing! 
 My little girl is missing! 
 Help me.
