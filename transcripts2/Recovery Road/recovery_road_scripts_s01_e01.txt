 Damn. 
 So we realize Nyla left her history book in Kevin's car, then we had to drive all the way over to the west side, but he already left Monica's house by the time we got there. 
 Long story short, it was quicker for her to drop me off at the house, so she did. 
 And that, O Mother, is the epically long, yet tediously dull account of why my car isn't in the driveway. 
 Ugh, well, just make sure and pick it up after school. 
 Because I have back to back meetings. I can't drive you. 
 (school bell ringing) 
 A few questions, and feel free to answer them in any order: How are you? And where's my car? 
 Pretty good, and I have no idea. 
 Oh. 
 You lost your car? 
 I didn't lose it. It's just currently occupying a space I'm presently unaware of. 
 Well, let's see: You left the party, you said you had to run a quick errand, and that you'd be right back. 
 And you never came right back. 
 I know. 
 Maybe your car went to go find that hoodie you borrowed from me last month that also went missing. 
 Wow, mystery solved. 
 Maddie, do you know what this is? 
 Um, it's a bottle of water. 
 Do the questions get harder... 
 This... isn't water. 
 No, it's not. It's vodka. 
 We found this in Maddie's locker this morning. 
 And can you do that, just search my locker? 
 Indeed, we can. 
 One of my friends must have put it in there as a joke. 
 Alcohol on school premises is a very serious offense, Maddie. 
 It's cause for expulsion. 
 Well, like I said, it's not mine. 
 Good. 
 Then this will just help clear it up. 
 I just need you to blow on that tip. 
 I don't have to do this. I know my rights. 
 "Students who are suspected of consuming illegal substances on school grounds will immediately be tested by appointed school officials and will face possible expulsion. 
 Any student refusing to submit to testing, will also face possible expulsion." 
 Hm. 
 (clears throat) 
 (machine calibrates) 
 Go ahead. 
 (beeping) 
 Thank you. 
 Maddie, how could you? 
 Mom. 
 This is so unfair. 
 You better take this seriously. 
 Unfortunately, I'm going to have to report this to the Head Master, and it's his decision whether or not Maddie can remain a student here. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 Is there any other option? 
 24 hours of detox and 90 days at a sober-living facility, effective immediately. 
 The closest teen treatment center is 40 miles away, but... with parental consent, I can arrange for you to live in an adult facility that's closer. 
 You can go to school by day and spend your evenings getting sober, but, Maddie, I will be watching you... 
 I'm not going to rehab. 
 It's not rehab. 
 It's a residential, outpatient treatment facility. 
 And you're out of your damn mind. 
 (scoffs) I'm sorry to hear that. 
 She'll do it. 
 What? 
 These are prohibited in detox. 
 You can have it back after 24 hours. 
 Now, please head down to room 248 for the strip search.

 This is ridiculous. 
 I'm not an addict. 
 If I was, wouldn't I have been Lohan-ing in detox? 
 Getting my drivers license was more taxing. 
 Why? Why are you doing this to me? 
 This is so unfair! 
 This is your fault. I hate you! 
 Tell you what... why don't I just stay home every night? 
 You can monitor me, smell my breath, make me pee in a cup. 
 I hate everything.

 ♪ This time is my time so step aside ♪ 
 I have good news. 
 You're not dead. 
 All right. Okay. 
 We have a couple more of these, and then we are officially done with the paperwork. 
 That one is a statement that Maddie has finished detox and is currently 24 hours drug and alcohol free. 
 So, Craig, how long have you been a counselor here? 
 Two years, yeah. 
 And how long have you been sober? 
 Hm? 
 Me? Oh, no, no, no. 
 I'm not in recovery. I'm just a counselor. 
 You really got screwed at the job fair, huh? 
 Maddie. 
 What? He's like 12 years old. 
 25. 
 And highly certified. 
 Would you like to see my credentials, Maddie? 
 That won't be necessary. 
 Please excuse my daughter's rude behavior. 
 Yes, I'm much more affable when I'm not being institutionalized against my will. 
 Right, now, this one says that if you go before the 90 days are up, I've still got to charge your mom for all of it. 
 So I can leave? 
 No. No, you cannot. 
 Now, all the information is in here. 
 But... 
 Thank you. But... 
 Quick lowdown: group sessions, every day, one-on-ones with me, daily. 
 You're on bathroom clean up in the women's wing. 
 Curfew is strictly enforced. 
 And you will need to earn the right to use your cell phone. 
 You're joking. 
 You do realize the withdrawal I'm going to go through from not having my phone is far greater than what you're expecting from my so-called "addiction." 
 Thank you. Also, for the first week, you can only leave for school and scheduled group activities. 
 But I get to go home on weekends, right? 
 Recovery isn't a 9-5, Maddie. Okay? 
 All right, okay. Look, here's... 
 Here's the deal. 
 You're going to find temptation everywhere you go, which is why you're going to need what I would call the four "S's." 
 Now, that's sobriety... 
 Cray-Cray, you need to get your ass in the game room, like, right now. 
 Oh right, yes. So everyone has their own little nicknames for me. 
 W... what's going on? 
 Oh, Vern took the remote and said he's not giving it back until he finds out who stole his Cheesy Chomps and they apologize. 
 Okay, I will take care of that. 
 Would you mind giving Maddie a quick tour? 
 Not at all. Hi! 
 (mouths) 
 Well, I'll let you girls go ahead. 
 I'm going to let myself out. 
 You can call me if you need me to bring you anything. 
 Okay? 
 How? 
 He took my friggin' phone. 
 There's a house phone. 
 (sighs) Hug me. 
 You're so sweet. Come on, girl. 
 Welcome to Springtime Meadows. 
 You're gonna love it here. We have so much fun. 
 Sober people decorated the house. 
 It's cool, right? 
 All right, I'll give you a hint. You're still very, very cold. 
 Girl : All right, everybody, this is Maddie. 
 Hi, Maddie. I'm Vern. 
 Did anybody look in the piano? 
 Maddie, you understand the difference between right and wrong, right? 
 If I did, would I be here? 
 That's a good answer. 
 Take this. 
 Guard it with your life. 
 Okay. 
 You're weird. 
 You say that like it's a bad thing. 
 All right, now, the kitchen is straight ahead. 
 The game room is to the left, in the basement. 
 That's where we play ping pong. 
 I always win. I used to be really good at all kinds of sports until I got into... Guess what I go into. You'll never guess. 
 For the sake of friends and family, I hope it was downers. 
 Meth. It was meth, girl. 
 But you can't tell from my teeth, huh? 
 I know, right? (Giggles) 
 Girl : So yeah, it was really bad. I lost custody of my daughter, but I'm gonna get her back. She's the reason I gotta to get clean, you know. 
 She's so sweet and so cute. 
 Like, she-could-totally-be in-pageants cute. 
 I have her tattooed on my thigh. Not her face, but her name. You want to see? 
 Maybe later. 
 Well, you will see later, honey. 
 Because guess what? We are... roomies! 
 (shrieks) 
 Oh, you don't know how excited I am. 
 I've been waiting so long to have a roommate that's not going through menopause. 
 You know, you're crushing my will to live. 
 Oh, sorry. Okay. 
 So, you have to journal, because it's a part of the program, but I love it because it's so much fun because I love to gossip. 
 So, what are you in for? 
 Um... a few sips of vodka. 
 That's all? Girl, this is going to be easy for you. 
 What? You want some of Vern's Cheesy Chomps? 
 I'm good. 
 Okay. 
 Trish? Trish, did you take my... 
 Maddie Graham. 
 Rebecca Granger. 
 Well, I suppose it was only a matter of time. 
 Wait. 
 So you two know each other? 
 Yeah, we're old friends. 
 Oh. 
 Oh my god. 
 That's so nice. 
 Last thing I remember is drinking a lot of tequila. 
 I woke up in lock up, them tell me me stabbed my cheating husband four times. 
 That guilt stays with me. 
 Don't get me wrong, I hate him. 
 But I hate me more. 
 One time, the CIA dosed an entire village with LSD just to see what would happen. 
 (laughing) 
 Girl : They did. 
 I guess what I've been struggling with the most is... how my ugly past keeps coming back to haunt me. 
 So, I had another dream last night. 
 A relapse dream. 
 And it's that guilt you wake up with. 
 It's hard to shake. 
 Even when you wake up and you realize you were just dreaming, you didn't do anything wrong... and I... 
 I just... 
 I don't really want to talk about this right now. 
 We'll deal with this at your one-on-one tomorrow, okay? 
 Okay, thank you. 
 All right. 
 (sighs) Okay, well, my friends, today is a day of hellos and goodbyes. 
 Maddie, would you like to introduce yourself? 
 Hi, I'm Maddie. 
 Oh right, yes. So in group, we introduce ourselves by saying, "Hi, I'm whomever, and I'm an alcoholic." 
 Hi, I'm whomever, and I'm an alcoholic. 
 Very good, very good. I haven't heard that one before. 
 I'm sorry, guys. I just don't belong here. 
 You know? 
 I really don't. 
 I appreciate your sobriety journey, but I'm just here because I have to be. 
 Craig, I just remembered something. 
 I don't belong here either. 
 Me either. 
 (all laughing) 
 Did anyone else feel like they didn't belong here their first day? 
 (overlapping agreement) 
 Yeah, I thought so. 
 Maddie, no one thinks they belong here... at first, but... 
 I think that where it took some of these guys weeks to come around, I've got a feeling that it's going to take you two days. 
 Two days of hating me, hating them, hating this place. 
 But I do have faith in you. 
 He said the same thing to all of us. 
 (laughing) 
 I absolutely did not. 
 Sorry, brother. 
 All right, okay. 
 Maddie, hello. 
 (overlapping greetings) 
 Hello, kid. 
 (under breath) Hi, Maddie. 
 And we are bidding a very fond farewell to our very dear Douglas, AKA Mr. "I'm going to rip your head off." 
 We're really going to miss you, buddy. 
 As is Springtime Meadows' ritual, we have a parting gift for you, and, Doug, you will leave behind something for the house. 
 Great. 
 Okay, so, we all chipped in and we got you this. 
 Oh, you replaced the one I lost. 
 (laughing) 
 Man : Put it on. Put it on. 
 Man : Yes. 
 (cheering) 
 Handsome! 
 Trish : Don't lose this one. 
 Wow. (Clears throat) 
 Um... 
 I'm just really grateful for you all... and for this house, and for my sobriety. 
 My life is so different now, and I'm just so excited to go out there and live it. 
 So I made something for the house. 
 It's kind of stupid, but... 
 That's beautiful. You made this? 
 Yeah. 
 Aw, thank you. 
 All right, come on, everyone. 
 Bring it in. 
 Watch my vase. 
 Craig : Yeah, watch the vase. 
 Hey, you take care of these guys, okay? 
 And let them take care of you. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 (chattering) 
 Welcome to the fun house. 
 Ooh, this is pretty. 
 My dad gave that to me. He's dead. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 It plays the theme from Ice Castles. 
 I don't know what that is. 
 So when did your dad... 
 Three years ago, this Memorial Day. 
 And how old were you? 
 14. 
 Well, that sucks. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 So how did he die? 
 He was killed by a drunk driver. 
 The irony is not lost on me. 
 Huh? 
 Never mind. 
 Dad? 
 Hi, princess. 
 You know I hate it when you call me that. 
 I know. 
 I miss you. 
 Like, a lot. 
 Shh. 
 I'm sure I'm going to be seeing you very, very soon. 
 (horn blaring) 
 (gasps) 
 (breathing heavily) 
 Tell me again why I'm not allowed to drive myself to school? 
 I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, Maddie, but you're going to be under constant supervision. 
 Well, good. You'll get to see that my life is actually pretty boring, and I'm not an addict. 
 Have you ever stopped to consider the reason I was drinking in school is because it's insufferably boring? 
 I make decent grades. How do you think that's possible? 
 Maybe we should just open up a bar on campus Maybe you should. 
 I'll get right on that. 
 Are you taking drugs? 
 Yes, I do crack. 
 Lots and lots of crack. In fact, I'm on crack right now. 
 I'm serious, Maddie. 
 Do you do drugs? 
 (dance music playing) 
 No, I do not do drugs. 
 But even if I did, what business is it of yours? 
 Aren't you supposed to be getting kids into college and handing out condoms? 
 I'm just not exactly sure why you've taken such an interest in me. 
 I'm a good student. Hell, I'm a frickin' virgin, by choice. 
 Ask anyone. 
 So whatever you think you know... 
 Maddie, a lot of aggression comes out in the early stages of recovery. 
 While it makes sense that you would take it out on me, the deal I made with you was more than fair. 
 So I'm here, when you're ready to have a real conversation. 
 But until then, I hope you like Christian pop. 
 (Christian pop playing) 
 ♪ Jesus is my savior ♪ 
♪ Savior ♪ 
 I love that song. 
 Oh, that was the longest car ride of my life. 
 Let me know if you need anything. 
 I don't. 
 
 
 
 Hey, babe. 
 Why did you come to school with the guidance counselor? 
 Uh, my car is in the shop. 
 And Ms. Molina lives close to us, and her and my mom are friends, and I hate her. 
 I would have given you a ride. 
 Oh, my phone's broken. 
 And as much as I love you, (clears throat) I'm a terrible girlfriend because I don't have your number memorized. 
 My life is falling apart. Hold me. 
 Come here, babe. 
 Okay. 
 (giggles) 
 I mean, here's the thing. 
 I've always been the kind of person that's like, "Sure, whatever." 
 I kind of just go with the flow, because life is so short, right? 
 Wait, what was I talking about? (Laughs) 
 Have you ever told a little white lie... and had to pile on many other little white lies to hide that little white lie? 
 I have never told a lie in my entire life. 
 Seriously? 
 See how good I am at it? 
 Mm. 
 (laughs) 
 If Zack asks, my car is in the shop. 
 Oh, little white lie? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Where is your car? 
 Duh, it's where I left it. 
 Where'd you leave it? 
 Beats the hell out of me. 
 Is your backpack in your car? 
 Yeah, why? 
 Is your computer in your backpack? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (at same time) Find my device. 
 Oh, I am dazzled by your insanely clever problem-solving skills. 
 Yeah, they're nothing compared to my breasts. 
 (clears throat) 
 Yeah, they're so spectacular. 
 (laughs) 
 (music playing over radio) 
 (Wes humming) 
 I'm sorry. 
 Maddie : No, it's cool. I'm almost done. 
 "There is a wisdom that is woe, but there is a woe that is madness." 
 Huh? 
 The book. 
 Look, I have to get out of here. 
 I need to get some nail polish. Do you want to come? 
 Um, it's after curfew. 
 So... 
 Hm. 
 Do I look like a girl who obeys curfews? 
 Well, I guess you wouldn't be in here if you did, huh? 
 Mm-mm. 
 (clears throat) Look, I'm climbing the walls here, so I don't care where we go, I just need to go. 
 Anywhere. 
 I'm a little all over the place, so you can come or not. Just don't tell, okay? 
 There's a hole in the back fence. We'd have to crawl through it. 
 You really want to do this? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're gonna be trouble. 
 So what's the deal with you and Rebecca? 
 Ugh, we used to be best friends. 
 It's all very "teen girl drama-rama." Too angsty to get into. 
 Fair enough. We should probably get back. 
 You've obviously never been shopping with a girl before. 
 Obviously not. 
 So, how did you end up at good old Sunshine Valley, or Springtime Mausoleum. Whatever it's called. 
 Which time? 
 Oh, it's too angsty to go into. 
 TouchÃƒÂ©. 
 We should stick to the basics. What's your favorite color? 
 What's your lucky number? 
 What do you want to be when you grow up? 
 (laughs) Blood red, 24, mortician. 
 Seriously? 
 True story. 
 The first funeral I ever went to was my dad's. 
 Wes : I'm sorry. 
 The funeral directors were really nice and caring. 
 They made something so unbearable, not exactly bearable, but less bad. 
 That's what I want to do too, make things a little less bad for people. 
 I'm sorry, I've never told anyone that before, and that is creepy and morbid. 
 It's not. 
 It's really not. 
 What do you think? 
 Come on, eh? 
 Smile, you're on camera. 
 Oh yeah. 
 (cans opening) 
 (choral music) 
 Come on. It's kind of funny. 
 Right? 
 Yeah, I'll see you outside. 
 Whoa, hold up there, hoss. 
 Look what I got us. 
 Ta-da. 
 Courtesy of Jocelyn Berman's slightly older sister, Eloise, who kind of looks like me but... 
 You're kidding me, right? 
 What? 
 I'm committed to my recovery this time. 
 Why the hell do you think I'm here? 
 Okay. 
 Never mind. 
 It's a joke. 
 Look. Look, I'm getting rid of it. 
 All right? Look. 
 I'm sorry. I'm a jerk. 
 Thank you for saving me from the evil forces of the drug store. 
 No worries. 
 (tires screech) 
 Okay. 
 Well, this is bad. 
 I think you've just set a record, breaking rules on your second night here, Maddie. 
 Just don't kick him out. It was my idea. 
 He was just protecting me. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, Maddie, why don't you go upstairs, pack your bags, and I'll call your mom to come pick you up. 
 Ms. Molina can make arrangements for your expulsion from Parsons-Bell. 
 You can't do... 
 Neither of us is leaving. 
 Right, Craig? 
 I need you to pee in this cup. 
 Okay, Maddie? 
 And this is going to be your only warning. 
 Do you hear me? 
 Yeah. 
 Go on, go. 
 Go. 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Not good, Maddie. 
 Wes is my sponsee. I can't have him participating in reckless... 
 I know, I messed up. 
 He... 
 You'll get the hang of this, okay? 
 It's like riding a bike. 
 I don't know how to ride a bike. 
 What? 
 I fell off the first time I tried, and it just seemed easier to walk. 
 And your parents didn't make you get back on? 
 Workaholics. 
 Okay, well, I'm going to teach you. 
 I didn't always look like this, you know. I used to be a dancer. 
 Hmm. 
 Wow. 
 Dude, you were hot. 
 I'm still hot. 
 You don't even know me. 
 Why do you care? 
 One day, you're going to have a moment like this with someone else, sharing your experience. 
 That's how it works. 
 And it does work. 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah. 
 Wes, you bailed me out once. 
 Now, I've returned that favor. 
 Are you sure you want to use that get-out-of-jail-free card on this girl? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm worried. 
 Don't be. 
 I can tell you like her, Wes. 
 And that means you are potentially putting your sobriety at risk, as well as Maddie's. 
 I think you're overreacting. 
 No. 
 You told me that you were going to follow every part of the program this time. 
 And that means no dating the first year. 
 I'm not dating her man. 
 It's the only way that your recovery is going to take top priority. 
 So you and Maddie can't happen. 
 We clear? 
 Yeah. 
 We're clear. 
 (door closes) 
 Hey, sorry about last night. 
 Oh, don't worry about it. 
 How did you even manage... 
 I can't really talk right now. 
 I have to go. I'm sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Found it. 
 I'm gonna give you a free pass on explaining why your car was parked on the west side of town or how you got home. 
 Thanks. 
 How's the... 
 How are you? 
 Um... (clears throat) 
 "Damp and drizzly." 
 You're gonna get through this. 
 We're gonna get through this. 
 I... found this on the front seat of your car. 
 I'm glad that you and Zack are being safe. 
 Yeah. Right. 
 You know, Maddie, you can talk to me... 
 I have to go. 
 Um... 
 I have things to do inside. 
 So, I'll see you later. 
 Trish : Come on, Maddie. We're going to be late for the AA meeting. 
 (Maddie crying) 
 Trish : Maddie? 
 No, I'm fine. 
 Please, no. 
 No, what happened? 
 (crying) I don't know. 
 This... this was in my car. 
 I don't... I don't remember. 
 I don't remember what happened on Thursday night. 
 And I've never... 
 (crying) I've never had s*x before. 
 And if I did, it wasn't with my boyfriend, because he was babysitting his brother on Thursday. 
 (sobbing) 
 What if I cheated on Zack with some stranger? 
 Maddie, if you were too drunk to remember, then it wasn't consensual. 
 But that's the thing. 
 What if I initiated it? 
 (sobbing) 
 What if I was... 
 (voice breaking) What if I was raped? 
 I don't know! 
 I can't remember. 
 What if this wasn't the first time? 
 (crying continues) 
 I don't know. I can't remember. 
 Maddie. It's okay, it's okay. 
 (crying heavily) 
 It's okay. 
 (sobbing heavily) 
 (people chatting) 
 Just mingle, ya hear, Maddie? 
 Mmm, yeah. 
 Hey, how you doing? 
 Hi! 
 Maddie, there's somebody that I really want you to meet. 
 Okay, I think you're going to love her. 
 Her and I have been best friends forever, and she has really been through it. 
 But she's so sweet, and I really think that maybe you could open up to her more than you could with Wiener Dog. 
 That's my nickname for Craig. 
 (laughs) 
 I'm Cynthia. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I can't believe you. 
 Maddie, I understand you're upset. 
 Don't you think it's a little hypocritical of you to call me out when you're an addict too? 
 Did you hear what you just did? 
 Called you out. 
 Nope. 
 You just admitted you were an addict, albeit accidentally, but it still counts. 
 Whatever. 
 I'm 12 years sober, Maddie... 
 And this is something you could have brought up many times. 
 The program works because of its anonymity. 
 Fine, but if one person finds out about my situation, Cynthia, believe you me, the entire school will find out about yours. 
 (sighs) 
 Hey, it's me. Are you home? 
 How is she? 
 She's fine. 
 Pissed at me. 
 But I expected she would be. 
 She's going to be okay though. 
 Voilà. 
 Oh wow. 
 I cleaned her room today. This is what I found. 
 I didn't realize it had gotten this bad. 
 How could I not have known? 
 Jamie would have known. 
 He always knew what was going on with her. 
 It's like he had this sixth sense. 
 (sighs) 
 First time she had a crush on a boy, he called it. 
 The first time she smoked pot, he was the one who busted her. 
 They got each other. 
 She told him things. 
 And I try, but we just don't. 
 Maddie can't ever find out that I was the one who told you to search her locker. 
 Of course not. 
 Trish : It's true. My dream in life is to be on a reality show. 
 Trish, that's actually worse than being an addict. 
 I'm gonna remind you you said that when I am rich and famous, and all of America loves me. 
 (giggling) 
 Doug? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I just came back to say hi to my junkie friends. 
 Hi. 
 Craig! 
 I just came to say hi. 
 Come here. 
 Hi. I remember you. 
 Do you remember me? 
 Doug, how did you get in? 
 There's a hole in the back fence. 
 Craig : Let go of her. 
 I just came to say hi. 
 Let Rebecca go. 
 Douglas, let go. 
 Hey, get back! 
 You guys think you're so frickin' great. 
 Just 'cause you're all clean and stuff! 
 Don't you? 
 (Rebecca screaming) 
 Douglas, listen to me. 
 No! 
 What? 
 We do not have that in here. 
 Yes we do! 
 Craig : You need to calm down. 
 You want to come party with me? All these people think we're losers, but we're different. 
 Okay, okay, Douglas. You have it your way. 
 Rebecca, I'd like you to go with Doug. Go on, go with him. 
 Go on, go. Take her. Take Rebecca. 
 Yeah? Yeah? 
 Go on. 
 Okay. 
 All right, let's get out of here. 
 (shouting) 
 Trish, call 911 please. 
 Hey. Hey. Hey. 
 (Douglas screaming) 
 Are you okay? 
 I think so. 
 (shouting continues) 
 Craig : All right. 
 (police radio chatter) 
 I really thought he was going to make it. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 What's going to happen to him? 
 He's had a lot of chances. 
 I don't think he's going to get off so easy this time. 
 He's not a bad guy. 
 Really, he's not. 
 This sucks. 
 You know, that could have been me. 
 Yeah. 
 Margarita : That could have been any one of us. 
 (radio chatter) 
 Oh my god. Oh my god, are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 All right, pack your bags. We're leaving. 
 We're going to find you a teen treatment center. 
 No, I... 
 I think I should stay here.

 But I can do this. 
 It's only 86 more days, and then I get my life back.

 Maddie's voice : I can do this. 
 I made a mistake. 
 A series of them. 
 Some I don't even remember. 
 But don't we all? 
 But if being a big old mess of a teenager has taught me anything, it's that there's nothing you can do that can't be undone. 
 Right? 
 Even the things you know you need to fix that you constantly say you'll get around to. 
 Who am I kidding? 
 Sometimes we do screw up. 
 Irreparably.

 Maddie's voice : A wise man once said, "There's wisdom that is woe, but there is a woe that is madness." 
 I don't know about the wisdom part, but the madness is definitely setting in.
