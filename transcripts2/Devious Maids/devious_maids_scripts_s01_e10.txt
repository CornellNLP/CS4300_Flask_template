 Previously on "Devious Maids"... 
 The man that raped her is not the father of her baby. 
 And there is some kind of connection between them. 
 So which one killed her? 
 I just wanna talk to you about your granddaughter. 
 Flora? 
 I have cancer. 
 But you don't have to worry about getting things done. 
 I can do both jobs. 
 Remi is using drugs. 
 Cocaine? 
 You're going back to rehab. 
 (Remi) Valentina told you, didn't she? 
 Olivia wasn't able to give him a baby. 
 And he left her. 
 He left Olivia because she's a loon and a half. 
 Doesn't Michael love me? No. 
 I am sorry. 
 (voice breaking) not enough to say, "I'm sorry," 
 When you've ruined someone's life. 
 I do love him, Rosie. 
 So I'm gonna change for him. 
 Be the best wife ever. 
 Mrs. Peri wants to make you happy. 
 Well, she had her chance. 
 You gotta give her another one. 
 I have something important to say. 
 Oh, God. 
 Your heart attack was very traumatic for me. 
 I'm sorry that you didn't have The rip-roaring good time that I had. 
 (inhales sharply) 
 I'm serious. 
 Seeing you in the hospital made me realize What a lousy wife I've been. 
 And I wanna make this marriage work. 
 So to do that... 
 I think we need therapy. 
 Therapy? 
 Obviously, I have anger issues. 
 I think it goes back to my father. 
 You know, he started drinking right after I was born. 
 Probably just a coincidence. 
 Are you  trying to antagonize me? 
 Look, I don't want to hear you blame someone else For the way you act. 
 Okay. 
 That's fair. (inhales sharply) 
 So... Will you go with me? 
 (scoffs) 
 (mouths words) 
 Fine. 
 I will go to therapy. 
 (chuckles) good. 
 This way, you can also work on some of  your  issues. 
 I don't have any issues. 
 (gags) 
 So I have a major flaw. 
 Great. Come on. Let's hear it. 
 You're terrified of conflict. 
 How could I be terrified of conflict? 
 I'm married to  you. 
 If a waiter spills on you, you apologize. 
 If someone takes a parking spot you've been waiting for, You say, "oh, well." 
 You are  so  determined to be a nice guy, You refuse to stand up for yourself... 
 Not to your boss, not to your agents, And especially not to me! 
 Wait. I'm sorry. 
 The flaw in our marriage Is we don't fight enough? 
 Oh, for God sake, Spence! 
 If I can admit I'm a raging bitch, Surely you can admit you're a wuss! 
 So... 
 Who wants cake? Huh? 
 ♪ 
 Phillipe just called. 
 The limo is pulling onto sunset. 
 Are you done with the balloons? 
 Almost. 
 Valentina, why don't you sound excited? 
 Remi's gonna be here any second. 
 She's afraid to see him. 
 She thinks he's angry with her. 
 Angry? 
 I promised not to tell anyone about his drugs. 
 He had to go to rehab because of me. 
 That's just silly. 
 Remi knows he needed help. 
 Then why hasn't he called me? 
 I haven't heard from him in a month. 
 People in rehab are busy. 
 There are therapy sessions, yoga classes, meditation. 
 It's a lot like a spa... 
 Except for all the people crying and shaking. 
 (vehicle approaches) 
 Ah! They're here. 
 Quick, put that away. 
 (keys jingle) 
 (door opens) 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe Remi  is  angry with you. 
 I know he is. 
 Well, if he walks in that door and gives you attitude, What will you do? I'll die! 
 (car doors shutting) no. You will hold your head up high Because you did the right thing. 
 And if he can't see that, well... 
 He's too stupid to love. 
 Please don't say that. 
 (sighs) 
 Hey, everybody! 
 Look who I found in the driveway! 
 Welcome back, Remi. 
 It is good to have you home. 
 Doesn't he look wonderful? 
 (door closes) 
 Isn't he just movie star handsome? 
 Oh, for Pete's sake, Genevieve, You're embarrassing the boy. 
 I just want him to know how proud we are. 
 Well, I think he gets it. 
 Remi, there's someone else waiting to see you. 
 You saved my life. 
 Thank you. 
 (buzzer in distance, cell door slams) 
 So... I hear you talked to Flora's grandmother. 
 We had a nice, long talk. 
 Did she tell you anything useful? 
 As a matter of fact... 
 She told me that Flora was seeing one of your friends. 
 What? 
 It was  his  child that she was expecting. 
 (buzzer in distance, cell door slams) 
 (sighs) no way. 
 We know this is hard. 
 It's impossible. 
 Flora never met any of my friends. 
 Are you sure? 
 I never introduced Flora to anyone. 
 We didn't even go out that much. 
 The only party we were at together was the... (hand thuds) 
 (sighs) Eddie, what is it? 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 I can't tell you. 
 (sighs) I think we're past the point Where you're allowed to be embarrassed. 
 I'll tell  her. 
 Not you. 
 Eddie, come on! Mom! 
 I'm not talking to you about this, okay? 
 It's okay. 
 (door closes) 
 Well, don't just sit there. 
 Tell me what you've done. 
 (sighs) 
 Yes, excellent. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Yes, bye. (beep) 
 Hey, good news! 
 Odessa's test results came back. 
 She's doing much better. 
 Fantastic! 
 When is she coming home? 
 They're keeping her at the hospital For two more weeks, just to be sure. 
 Oh. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. I was just hoping she'd be back sooner than that. 
 If there's something you need, I can do it. 
 Thanks. 
 There are certain things Odessa does for me That I don't trust anyone else to do. 
 Oh. 
 Well, like what? 
 You know... 
 Intimate stuff. 
 Intimate? 
 What does that mean? 
 Odessa... 
 Shaves me. 
 Huh? 
 Well, I can get... Pretty hairy. 
 I hate waxing. 
 So... Odessa shaves me. 
 Hell, I can do that. Really? 
 You wouldn't mind? No, no, no! 
 I might even enjoy it. 
 This is great. Okay. 
 'Cause I got a date tomorrow night, And I'm in need of some serious grooming. 
 Oh, that's just a little stubble. 
 I'll take care of it in the morning. 
 Uh, Carmen? 
 I shave my own chest. 
 I need you to do my back. 
 (laughter) (rosie) oh, no. 
 So he asked you to shave his back? 
 That's right. 
 Just how much hair are we talking? 
 If you cross a werewolf with a Kardashian. 
 Oh, my God. 
 So are you gonna do it? 
 I don't want to, but do I have a choice? 
 Is there a polite way To tell your boss he's deformed? 
 I once worked for this 80-year-old lesbian. 
 She asked me to give her a bikini wax. 
 I will give you $10 to stop this story right now. (chuckles) 
 (chuckles) I was so nervous. 
 I dripped the wax onto her... 
 (gasps) 
 Did she fire you? 
 Hmm? She offered me a raise. 
 That's weird, right? 
 (laughter) hey... 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 Wanted to come say hi. 
 This is Remi Delatour, the boy I've been telling you about. 
 Hola. (Remi) nice to meet you guys. 
 I'm sorry to interrupt. I just need to speak with Zoila for a moment. (Rosie)  oh. Okay. Excuse us. (whispers) he's so cute. (gasps) Rosie's story gave me an idea on how to handle Alejandro. You think I should pour wax on his... You know? No. Tell him you'd be happy to shave his back. But say you need a little bump in your salary first. And then ask for a raise that's so big... It'll make the hair on his back stand on end. (chuckles) perfect! (laughs) So? What's on your mind? I would very much like to start dating your daughter. Oh. But I know you might have some reservations Because I was... Doing drugs? Yeah. I-I just thought that, You know, I should get your permission first. Well, if you really want permission, You should talk to her father. Okay. Um, does he know that I was... Doing drugs? Yeah. I may have mentioned it. He'll wanna meet you. Can you come to the house for dinner? I'd... I'd love to. Good. Oh, and this whole asking permission thing Is really... Classy? Smart. (indistinct conversations) Mmm. Hello, Rosie. What are you doing here? Are you shopping? In a manner of speaking. Oh. I wanted to invite you to a party. (car alarm chirps) A party? You sound surprised. Oh, rich people don't invite me to parties. Well, they would if they knew you like I do. You don't know me so much. I know enough to be... Fascinated. (bag rustles) I don't have nothing to wear to a party. Then I'll give you some money. What? So you could buy a gown. And I'll make sure there's a... Little left over. You make me uncomfortable. (chuckles) That's because you're sensing my hidden agenda. I don't know what that is, but don't take it out. A friend of mine is coming to this party, And he's been a little down lately. And I thought you could meet him and... Entertain him. Entertain him? Oh, Rosie, you're so delightfully naive. (whispers) but we both know you're not stupid. (gasps) (gasps) (tires peal) (gears shift, tires peal) Hi, Ida. It's marisol... Again. I need you to call me and tell me what Eddie said. Surely it can't be that bad. And if it is... Just call me, okay? (cell phone beeps) Michael! Michael! Is something wrong? No, no. Everything is right... absolutely, wonderfully right. Michael, get out here! What's going on? Mm. I'm pregnant. (gasps) oh! (muffled voice) oh! Oh! (laughs) When did you find out? I took an E.P.T. Test yesterday. But I wasn't sure. So I made an appointment with Dr. Kagan. And we ran some tests. We're gonna have a baby! And we're gonna have a baby! (both) mwah! Congratulations, you two. (both laugh) I am so happy for you. So who are we gonna call first? Your mother or my sister? Well, uh, I don't think we should tell anyone just yet. He's right. It's better to wait a few weeks just in case. But I have to tell somebody. I know. I'll call Kate ebley. Uh, Taylor. I was the first person she called When she found Peter in bed with that jockey. I owe her one. (chuckles) I really wouldn't worry about it too much. Taylor is healthy. She's got the best doctors in the world. I'm not worried about that. Kate ebley has a big mouth. You're worried Olivia might hear. Yeah. She's gonna find out eventually. I know. But I should be the one to tell her. You're divorced. You don't owe her anything. We were married 21 years. I owe her some dignity. Adrian Powell propositioned you? In the supermarket parking lot. What exactly did he say? He invited me to a party, And then he offered to buy me a dress. Well, that's awful. So... When did he tell you he wanted to have s*x? Well, he never actually said that. But his eyes did. And so did his finger. His finger? Mm-hmm. He went like this. And I know what that finger was saying. Sweetheart, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. The guy's obviously a creep. (whispers) yeah. The good news is it's over. You never have to talk to him again. (grunts) That's it? Huh? You're not going to his house? Why would I do that? So you could punch him or kick him Or hit him with a stick. Well, you're serious. He insulted me. Yes. He made an indecent proposal. (sighs) (scoffs) This town is full of those. It's nothing to freak out over. Mrs. Peri's right. About what? You're a wuss. Excuse me? Yeah. You're afraid to fight. It's okay. Not every man can do that. Hey. Hey, I am not afraid to fight. Mm. But I don't need to pounce some perv Just to prove how macho I am. Ernesto would have hit him. But that's because I belonged to him. It was his job to protect me. I forget. (voice breaks) I do not belong to you. (telephone ringing in distance) (indistinct conversations) So why haven't you called me back? (sighs) This is not the kind of news you deliver over the phone. So Eddie said you could tell me? It's okay? Yeah. He just didn't want to be there when you found out. That doesn't sound good. Flora never met any friends of Eddie's. But he remembers that she met some of his clients. Clients? Eddie had a small business. He never mentioned that to me. No, he wouldn't have. What kind of business are we talking about exactly? Your son has supported himself for the last two years By selling drugs. He had a partner... somebody named Brad... Who was a coworker at Beverly cuisine catering. They sold to the guests At the swanky parties they worked. (sighs) Anyway, Eddie says Flora met some of his buys. He thinks Brad can tell us more. Did Eddie murder Flora? You know he didn't. A minute ago, I knew my son would never be a drug dealer, But I was wrong. What else am I wrong about? I know you're disappointed and upset. But you can't give up on Eddie. (sighs) Not now. Not when we're so close to finding out the truth. So... What do we do now? I got a hold of the people at the catering company. They gave me Brad's cell, but he won't return my calls. (sighs) Don't worry. I will find this punk. (door opens) hey. I'll be talking to Eddie tonight. Any message for him? Tell him I love him. But I won't be able to see him for a while. (sighs) (engine turns off) (grunts) Hi. Hi. (door closes) So before we go in, I wanted to warn you about something. What's that? My dad has a weird sense of humor. Everybody's dad has a weird sense of humor. No. Most people's fathers say stuff that's dumb or silly. My dad's jokes are sort of... Offensive. I'm sure he'll be fine. There you are! Hey,  papi. I want you to meet Remi. Remi, this is my dad. It's an honor to meet you, sir. I brought you a little something. Oh. Zoila! The drug addict brought me scotch! (chuckles) oh! Come on! You thought that was funny, right? You know what? If you can laugh at the stupid mistakes I've made in my life, well, then... I guess I can, too. I like this kid. You got a little, uh, powder right there. (sniffs) (laughs) Mami! Okay. Okay. Let's not bring her into this. I'll behave. 
 
 It's an honor to welcome you to our home, Remi Delatour. And I'm honored to be here, mister... Oh, my God. This is so awkward. I just realized, I don't even know your last name. It's Diaz. Right. I'm so sorry, Mr. Diaz. (chuckles) I get it. My wife and daughter work for you. You call them by their first names. Exactly. God, I really hope I didn't offend you. (chuckles) no! Relax. We're all friends here. Nobody's offended. Hey, Carmen. Got a sec? Sure. (dishes thud) You need something? I believe we had an appointment? Right. You know... Shaving isn't really in my job description. So if want me to do this, I feel I... Deserve a raise. Like what? $50 a week? $250. But if you'd rather go to a salon, I will totally... you got it. What? You got your raise. Let's go. (sighs) (clears throat) (whistles) You know what? I'm gonna need some alcohol first. (bottle top unscrews) Disinfecting the razor? Yeah. Sure. (exhales) (bottle thuds) okay. Let's do this. (sighs) here you go. (lid pops) (sighs) (spritzes) mm. Careful. You don't want to put too much. Not possible. (inhales deeply) (whispers) okay. (Alejandro) ow! I'm sorry! You cut me. I know. And I feel so bad. Why would you do that? I sort of had my eyes closed. Why? For me... And this is just my opinion... Back hair is nasty. Oh. Again, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... Have dinner with me. (chuckles) now why would I want to do that? Well, I can promise you good food, Good conversation. I'll make you laugh. I might even tell you I'm sorry for the way I cheated on you during our marriage. If you tell me that, I  will  laugh. It's true, though. Phillipe Delatour, what are you up to? Uh, these last few days, uh... Have just got me thinking. I wish I had been a better father to Remi, A better husband to you. Oh. So what do you say? I'll take you out for a steak And a ridiculously expensive bottle of wine. (chuckles) you're gonna get me drunk And make a pass at me? Well, not if it would insult you. It would insult me if you didn't. So you'll go? I adore you, Phillipe. But I'm not some toy you can play with Anytime you feel lonely. And just because I've forgiven you for the past, Doesn't mean I've forgotten. So we'll go out and just talk about the past... Like old friends. All right. But just so we're clear, If you stare at a pretty waitress While I'm speaking, I will stab you in your neck with my fork. (chuckles) Well, I promise. I will only have eyes for you. Michael? Sorry for just dropping in. It's fine. Sit. Sit. Oh. Well, this is nice. It's a silk rope tieback for some drapes I'm doing. I was gonna redo our drapes with something like that. But then you left. Yeah. Well... So... It's so good to see you. (chuckles) I hope Taylor's doing well... She said, insincerely. (chuckles) (chuckles) well, Taylor is fine. No. She's more than fine, actually. Oh? Taylor and I are going to have a baby. I thought you should hear it from me. I know this must be upsetting. Only because I couldn't give you children. I know that's all you ever wanted. Not  . So... Are you happy? Yes. Well, good. Because that's all  I  ever wanted. That's a nice thing to say. I mean that. You must know I still love you. I do. And I think it's time you stopped. I wish I knew how. Are you... Going to be okay? Oh... My sweet Michael. You shouldn't worry about me. I am no longer your problem. (door opens) (door closes) So... This is delicious. What do you call it? Stuffed peppers. Valentina made them. Really? You know how to stuff peppers? It's Mexican food. I'm Mexican, or did you not know that either? (clears throat) so, Remi... Did you ever try heroin? Pablo! I'm trying to break the tension. By talking about heroin? Fine. You do the small talk. So it is really nice to finally have you over, Remi. It's my pleasure. It's a wonderful house. It's cozy, but we like it. So is it just the three of you here? (fork clinks) Who else would be here? Well, I wasn't sure if maybe you had... brothers and sisters? You think I have brothers and sisters? I'm guessing... You don't? Why do you have to guess? You should  know. Valentina. I know everything about him. I know what his favorite movies are, What he likes for breakfast, What kind of shaving cream he uses. How can you not know my last name is Diaz? How is that possible? (door closes) (sighs) I bet you wish you had some heroin right now, huh? (automated female voice) we're sorry. The mailbox of the subscriber you're trying to reach is full. (beep) (cell phone beeps) Where have you been? My friend Celia took me shopping for baby clothes. You told Celia? Taylor! I was the first person she told about her lap-band surgery. I totally owed her. Well, can you just not tell anyone else, please... At least for a few weeks? Fine. So how cute are these? Adorable. (chuckles) Did you get everything in blue? It's gonna be a boy. How do you know that? I just do. (chuckles) okay. I also know he's going to be smart and talented And funny and full of mischief. And I will love him more than anyone in the world. What's wrong? I was just thinking about a woman I know Who has a son. And she thought that she knew exactly how he would turn out. But... She was wrong. (sighs) Well, I don't really care what my son is like, As long as he shows up. (chuckles) Now I'm gonna show you the blanket I bought. It is beyond precious. (shopping bag rustling) Okay... (whispers)  oh. (chuckles) (normal voice) you know... Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to tell people you were pregnant. You think? Just a few. And you could tell 'em at the same time. Do something fun, like have a dinner party. That'd be wonderful. And you'd make something special? No, this is your first baby. You gotta do it right. Meaning? Hire a catering company. (spool clacks) Did Remi leave? What choice did he have? Your father kept asking him If he wanted to watch "trainspotting." I'm sorry I freaked out and ruined the dinner. Just because Remi doesn't know you're "Valentina Diaz" Doesn't mean he isn't crazy about you. I know. It's just, I worry he never bothered to learn my last name... (object clatters) Because... He still thinks of me as the help. Come on. Well, why wouldn't he? Most of the time when he sees me, I'm making his bed, washing his socks, Pouring milk on his cereal. Are you ready for an obvious solution to this problem? I guess. Quit. Quit? He won't think of you as the help If you don't hang around his house Helping him all the time. (chuckles) Are you... Sure? You're starting school in the fall anyway. I think it's great. Thank you,  mami. (giggles) (chuckles) What's so funny? I was just thinking, If you and Remi end up getting married, You'd spend the rest of your life Fixing his room, washing his socks, Pouring milk on his cereal. But then I'll be his wife, And he won't think of me as the help. You know nothing about marriage. (pats leg) For the last time, Dalton. Jenny's with me now. She's a drunk. She doesn't know what she wants. I think you'd better leave. You don't wanna be with me, Jenny? No problem. You pathetic tramp. You wanna meet someone? Meet... My... Fist. (mouths words) (smack) (dramatic music swells) (remote control chirps) (sighs) (doors open) Hello, Mr. Powell. I don't know if you remember me. Well, of course I do, Spence. We met last year at that, uh, charity dinner. Yeah. It was for burn victims. Right. They, uh, served barbecue. No one got the irony but me. Mr. Powell, I'm here to talk to you about Rosie falta. Ah, such a lovely woman. I'm a little angry at her. Angry? Well, she left this house without notice. You know how hard it is to find attractive help? Look what I'm reduced to. This hulking mass is Olga. She won a bronze medal for Bulgaria in the shot put. She now works here And eats me out of house and home. (speaks Bulgarian) What'd she say? Must be time for her feeding. (loudly) you keep cleaning. I'll get you some meat. Look, about Rosie... What about her? She says you insulted her. That doesn't sound like me. Do you deny propositioning her? I discussed some business, yes. Business? Did you or did you not offer her money for s*x? You know what I hate? Hypocrites. What? You're having s*x with her, right? That's beside the point. No, it's not. I admit I wanna take a bite off the same apple You're nibbling on. What's so wrong about offering to pay top dollar for it? There's someone I want you to meet, Adrian. Who's that? My fist. (squeak) uhh. (groaning) (dog barking in distance) (footsteps approach) Could I talk to you? My date's gonna be here any minute. This will take just two seconds. I obviously hurt your feelings yesterday, And I didn't mean to. You said that I could trust you. So I exposed a part of myself... Something I'm embarrassed by... And you insulted me. And I am so sorry. Am I such a scary boss That you feel like you can't even say "no" to me? No. No, no. You're terrific. And I wanted to help you, but I-I... I couldn't, because I'm immature And silly and... (sighs) I'm sorry. Apology accepted. (exhales) I'm glad you think I'm terrific. Oh, I do. (chuckles) And now that I've gotten to know you, I-I think you're amazing, and I like you so very much. Ah. So you didn't like me at first? Huh? I couldn't tell. You don't really let... People in. That's true. Why is that? I've trusted a lot of people over the years, And, um... So many of them have betrayed me. So I keep the walls up just to be safe. I get not wanting to show people your back. But you shouldn't be afraid to show people your soul. You're right. I shouldn't. Well, just know... You can trust me. You can be open with me and tell me what's going on, And I will never,  ever betray you, okay? (vehicle approaches) My date is here. Well... Have a nice time. Carmen... I do trust you, And it would be nice to have someone in my life, Aware of what's going on with me. So I wanna introduce you to someone... Someone I'm very serious about. Alejandro, I had no idea. No one does. What do you mean? Is she in the business? (door opens) Carmen, I want you to meet Scott... My boyfriend. (gasps) hi. Welcome. (gasps) Genevieve. (laughs) I heard Phillipe was your plus one. And we also brought our son Remi And his new girlfriend Valentina. Hi. How you doing? (clears throat) Just to make it a family affair. You don't mind, do you? Why would I mind you bringing two extra people... To a dinner party? (laughs) you know what they say. The more, the merrier. (under breath) whoever says that, I want them to stop. I'll get some more chairs. I'll do it. Watch the door. (whispers) okay. Hey, sorry I'm late. Traffic was awful. You must be Brad? Yeah. We've been expecting you. (indistinct conversations) (groans) You fought with Adrian Powell? Yeah, well, I tried to. Why? He insulted Rosie. He offered her money for s*x. Are you kidding me? That is so gross. Is she here? She's at the store. Well, I went over to Adrian's house To set him straight, but... Before I could punch his lights out, I slipped and gave myself a concussion. And... You did this for Rosie? Yeah, and I-I don't know why. I... Guess I was... Avenging her. If you wanna laugh at me, go ahead. Now why would I laugh? 'Cause I made a fool out of myself. You defended a woman who was sexually harassed. That's not funny. It's gallant as hell. Wow. It's been a while. Since what? Since you've been nice to me. Thanks. You surprised me today. My brave boy. If you can keep doing that, I think we're gonna be okay. (laughter, indistinct conversations) Okay. (clears throat) Okay. (conversations stop) Taylor and I... Have a little announcement to make, And we're not telling everyone just yet For reasons that will soon become obvious In a little less than nine months. It seems I'm going to become a father. Oh! (laughter and cheers) (man) congratulations! Fantastic. (man) that's great. (applause continues) (man) cheers, cheers. (women) cheers. (glasses clinking) (indistinct conversations) Can you come with me? I need to talk to you for a second. I'm cleaning as fast as I can. This isn't about this party. I'm Eddie's mother. (indistinct conversations) (sighs) I am  not  screwing around. I will go to the police, And I will tell them about your little endeavor Unless I start getting some answers. Look, I didn't know Flora was pregnant, I swear. But you were aware she was cheating on Eddie. We... we were working a party for Flora's boss. Eddie was doing some business with some trust fund brats. Anyway, there was this one kid. The second Eddie's back was turned, Flora was all over him. Couple weeks later, I saw them out together. I need a name. I don't ask customers for names. He's over there. You can ask him yourself. Over where? He's at this party? Right there. (indistinct conversations) Remi Delatour? If you say so.
