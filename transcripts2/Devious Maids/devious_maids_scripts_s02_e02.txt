 Previously on Devious Maids... 
 [Shots] 
 If you leave now, we won't call the police. 
 [Grunts] I think they want our jewelry. 
 [Gasps] 
 That... I can't take. 
 Too hot to handle. 
 This is for you, ma'am. 
 Wear it well. 
 Adrian is having a normal emotional reaction to a devastating experience. 
 You should consider hiring a bodyguard. 
 I'm Tony Bishara, and I look forward to protecting you and your husband. 
 I'm not coming back home. 
 Where do you plan on staying? 
 Hi, there. 
 I understand you're looking for a maid? 
 Hey. You must be Zoila's daughter. 
 You the new pool boy? 
 I'm Ethan. 
 We will produce your album. 
 If I pretend to be your wife. 
 I'm going to propose tonight. 
 Will she still love you when she finds out what you did? 
 She better not. 
 Hey, there. 
 Hello, my darling. 
 Dahlia died 15 years ago. 
 I think Nicholas is ready to move on. 
 Did he mention that she committed suicide? 
 Ms. Falta, you are released in good faith. 
 Hello, Mrs. Peri. 
 I really thought you were deported. 
 Is Mr. Spence here? 
 I'd like to see him, too. 
 Well, you're in a good mood. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I have great news and amazing news. 
 Okay. I'm all ears. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 [Laughs] 
 I don't understand. 
 Spence and I have been having s*x every day. 
 I should be knocked up by now. 
 Well, I can start you on fertility drugs if you like, but what's the rush? 
 Let's just say it's better for my marriage if I'm pregnant. 
 Now... 
 Shoot me up with everything you got. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey! 
 Just had my first visit with the O.B. 
 Doc says I won't be showing for a while. 
 Lucky me. 
 What's wrong? 
 [Sighs] 
 I had an affair with Rosie. 
 It's not just a one-time thing. 
 I'm in love with her. 
 And I need to be with her. 
 I want a divorce. 
 We're having a baby, Spence. 
 [Sighs] Yeah, I know. 
 I know the timing is rotten, but the truth is, our marriage has been over for a long time, and we both deserve to be happy. 
 I just want to thank you. 
 You're doing me a huge favor. 
 You're helping me stay in America. 
 I should thank you. 
 [Car door closes] 
 And I will take wonderful care of your family. 
 Oh, well, mostly, you'll be taking care of my Uncle Ken. 
 He recently had a stroke, but I'm sure that his wife and daughter will need some help, as well. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Good luck to you. 
 Aren't you going inside? 
 [Chuckling] Oh, no. 
 I'm not going in there. 
 Why not? 
 You'll see. 
 So, your husband doesn't talk? 
 Not since the stroke, and... 
 I'm his daughter. 
 I'm his wife. 
 Oh. 
 I married Kenny two years ago. 
 Should I call you Mrs. Miller? 
 [Chuckles] I'm just Didi. 
 But you can call her miss Miller. 
 She's never been married, and she's 40. 
 Call me Lucinda. 
 And you can also call her Ambrosia. 
 That was your name at the strip club, wasn't it... 
 Ambrosia? 
 So, Rosie, this is your little boy. 
 Does he speak English? 
 Almost. 
 He's learning new words every day. 
 Do you have kids? 
 Maybe once Ken gets better, but there's no rush. 
 I've got time. 
 I hope you do have a baby. 
 They'll never let her adopt with that arrest for drug possession. 
 What did the cops catch you with... ecstasy? 
 ¿Mama, qué es ecstasy? 
 No, no, no. 
 You don't need to learn that word. 
 Could you show us to our room now? 
 Sure. 
 Follow me. 
 Hey, papito. 
 You know, Rosie, Lucinda and I are not always like this. 
 [Chuckles] Okay. 
 Sometimes, we get nasty. 
 H-hey! 
 That's my breakfast. 
 No, that is a heart attack wrapped in a flour tortilla. 
 What did the doctor say about your cholesterol? 
 [Sighs] 
 You know I can't hear you when I'm looking at cheese. 
 [Groans] 
 Can you hear me now? 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Hey, mija! 
 Is that Valentina? 
 Let me talk to her. 
 Hey, your mom's here. 
 You want to say hi? 
 Whatever. 
 Just find out where she is. 
 [Chuckling] Really? 
 You're working as a maid? 
 What?! 
 Give me the phone. 
 So, you're a live-in? 
 That's good. 
 No! That is not good! 
 She's supposed to be in design school! 
 What's that? 
 She says you know the people she's working for. 
 I do? 
 Evelyn and Adrian Powell? 
 No, no, no. That's good. 
 That's good, mija. 
 What is going on? 
 Marisol asked me to help her clean out the closet. 
 Yeah, the rest of my stuff is being delivered tomorrow, so I'm gonna need more room. 
 But those are Dahlia's letters, her private things. 
 Look, I am being careful. 
 I am just moving this stuff into the garage. 
 That is not your decision to make. 
 If you want to rearrange things around here, you need permission. 
 From you? 
 From Nicholas. 
 It's his house, remember? 
 We're getting married. 
 I thought I had a say in where things go. 
 Well, you're not married yet. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 You should have seen it. 
 It was like... 
 Cut him in two. 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, hey, Carmen. 
 I want you to meet Dario. 
 Dario, this is Carmen. 
 His fiancée. 
 Really? 
 It's a long story. 
 I'd love to hear it. 
 Since I'm beautiful, I can't help but notice that neither of you is looking at me. 
 [Sighs] I'm sorry. 
 Um, Dario is an old friend. 
 We haven't seen each other in years. 
 And we were just catching up. 
 No. What you're doing is flirting, and everyone at this party's starting to notice. 
 Maybe it's time to go. 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Here's, uh, the keys to my car. 
 Don't wait up. 
 Hmm. 
 Anything else, Mrs. Powell? 
 No. Tanya and I will call once we've finished shopping. 
 Well, kudos on the new bodyguard. 
 He is positively scrumptious. 
 Is he? 
 I hadn't noticed. 
 And my breasts are real, and I love my stepchildren. [Chuckles] 
 Are we done lying to each other now? 
 I admit Tony's handsome, but it's not like anything's going to happen. 
 Not all of us like to seduce the help. 
 Oh, pbht! 
 I shower with my plumber one time... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Evelyn, what's wrong? 
 Ow. 
 Where did you get that? 
 It was a gift. 
 Let me see it. 
 No! 
 That's my blood Ruby pendant. 
 No, it's mine! No! 
 Evelyn, what are you doing? 
 Leave me alone! 
 She stole my necklace. 
 [Screaming] 
 What's going on? 
 They're just having a... minor disagreement. 
 Give it back, you bitch! 
 Hey. 
 You're hurting me! 
 Hey, hey. Hey. 
 [Gasps] 
 She's getting away! 
 For the love of God, someone shoot her! 
 Alejandro. 
 It's 6:00 in the morning! 
 Can we discuss this later, please? 
 I am exhausted. 
 Well, I'm your fiancée. 
 You should have called. 
 You know, from now on, if you want to have s*x with hot guys, you do it here, home, okay, so I don't worry. 
 Dario and I didn't have s*x. 
 Don't tell that to the other gays. 
 They'll kick you out of the union. 
 We hadn't seen each other in 10 years. 
 We had some serious catching up to do. 
 So... is he an ex? 
 He was the one that got away. 
 When he moved to Europe, he begged me to come with him, but I couldn't because of my career. 
 Of course, because your career is very important. 
 But seeing him last night made me rethink a lot of my choices. 
 He said he still loves me, and he asked me to move to Spain with him. 
 And this time, I'm considering it. 
 Uh, but... but wh... 
 What about us? 
 We have the engagement party Friday. 
 Yeah. I'm thinking we should wait on that. 
 Wait? 
 We're getting married in six weeks. 
 Maybe not. 
 I don't know. 
 Look, I need to get some rest 'cause I'm seeing Dario again tonight, and this time, we won't be talking. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 [Mixer whirring] 
 Hey. 
 Are you baking a cake? 
 [Chuckles] I'm trying to. 
 It's daddy's birthday tomorrow. 
 Mm. 
 You're such a good daughter. 
 Well, I like to think so. 
 Have you always lived with your father? 
 Oh, lord, no. 
 After I got my master's, I lived in New York. 
 I was a sculptor. 
 Really? 
 I was starting to make a name for myself, but then mama died. 
 And daddy was so devastated, I had to come back and take care of him. 
 It was really nice. 
 Then, one night, he goes out drinking, and he comes back with that cheap piece of Hollywood trash. 
 You mean Mrs. Didi? 
 He let that slut crawl into my mama's bed. 
 I will never forgive him for that. 
 [Spatula clatters] 
 Are you okay? 
 I really shouldn't talk about this. 
 It makes me want to spit. 
 Maybe I should finish the cake. 
 Good idea. 
 Miss Lucinda? 
 I'm sure Mrs. Didi loves your father. 
 Rosie, do me a favor. 
 Don't ever say anything nice about that woman. 
 Okay, but, uh, I just don't want to take sides. 
 Taking sides is part of this job, and I'm just happy to know you'll be on mine. 
 Hey, pool boy! 
 What are you doing? 
 If you must know, I'm looking for a bathroom. 
 But you're tracking in mud. 
 Well, that's something to remember me by. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 [Mop clatters] 
 I don't want to talk to you. 
 Good. 
 I don't want to talk to you, either. 
 Where's your room? 
 Upstairs. Why? 
 Mom! 
 What are you doing? 
 Mom. 
 That's a closet. 
 [Door closes] 
 I'm here to pack up all your stuff and take you home. 
 I don't want you working for the Powells. Why not? 
 Because you're only 19, and they're dangerous. 
 That's the gift-wrapping room. 
 Damn, this house is big. 
 Look, I don't care what you think of the Powells. 
 They have been nothing but nice to me. 
 Yeah, well, the Powells are not the only reason I want you out of here. 
 You should be in school making something of your life. 
 I can't afford school right now. 
 Your father and I will take care of it. 
 I can do it on my own. 
 I just need a little time. 
 Girls like you think you have all the time in the world, but the years fly by and then one day, you wake up and you realize it's too late to make your dreams come true. 
 And then, you spend the rest of your life cleaning somebody else's oven. 
 You're doing it again. 
 You're trying to control me. 
 Can't you get a different job... 
 Something in a mall? 
 No! 
 I work for the Powells, and that's all there is to it. 
 Now, please, go back to your life, and let me have mine. 
 Okay, guys, I'm gonna want everything in the master bedroom. 
 Everything? 
 I mean, there's over 50 boxes in the truck. 
 Oh, I know. 
 What's all this? 
 The rest of my boxes arrived today. 
 Y-yeah, I... I can see that. 
 I was gonna store some of this stuff in the hallway closet. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Well, why didn't you? 
 [Sighs] 
 Because it's already filled... 
 With Dahlia's things. 
 Oh. 
 So, this little display, it's your way of asking me to move them? 
 I guess it was a little passive-aggressive. 
 Tell me, what part of this is passive? [Chuckles] 
 All right, first thing tomorrow, I'll have Ethan move Dahlia's things to the garage. 
 [Sighs] Thank you. 
 I didn't think you'd mind, but Opal said that I needed your permission. 
 You know, on second thought, I don't want Dahlia's things in the garage. 
 Call goodwill tomorrow. 
 Have them take everything away. 
 Are you sure? 
 Dahlia's gone. 
 But you are here to stay. 
 [Sighs] Oh, Nick. 
 Mm. 
 [Door closes] 
 Hello, there. 
 Rosie. 
 You scared me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What are you doing up? 
 I wanted to fix Mr. Ken's robe before he got up in the morning. 
 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 Well... 
 That's a pretty dress. 
 I know how it looks, me hitting the clubs while Kenny's stuck in that chair, but every once in a while, I need to have a good time. 
 It must be hard on you, having a sick husband. 
 It is. 
 When I first met Kenny, I didn't think he was that old. 
 I just thought he was adorable. 
 And funny. 
 And he dressed better than any man I'd ever met... 
 Custom-made shirts, Italian shoes. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We had two wonderful years. 
 Then, one day, I found him lying on the floor. 
 So, what has Lucinda told you about me? 
 Did she call me a gold digger and a slut and a moron? 
 She never said moron. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, don't you believe a word she says. 
 I love Kenny. 
 She's just jealous 'cause that big old ass of hers has been on the market for years and no one's buying. 
 Mrs. Didi. 
 How could you live with someone you hate? 
 I just try to remind myself when Kenny dies, all this belongs to me. 
 And you should keep that in mind, too. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Mrs. Powell, I really have to advise against this. 
 The man at the soup kitchen said he's seen that homeless woman around here. 
 If any of the other bums recognize her, I could have my necklace back by tonight. 
 Well, at least let's stick together while we hand these sketches out. 
 Oh, that'll take hours. 
 Relax. 
 Adrian and I will be fine. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Car door closes] 
 Now... 
 You try that alley, and, uh, we'll search over there. 
 [Sighs] 
 Adrian? 
 Darling, what's wrong? 
 We shouldn't have come here. 
 But you agreed to this. 
 At home, in the living room. 
 Now that we're here, it's so dark. 
 This adolescent cowardice of yours is really getting on my nerves. 
 Get out of the car. 
 No! 
 
 
 
 Adrian! 
 Hey, little mama. 
 Oh! 
 [Chuckling] Hello, there. 
 You startled me. 
 Oh, well, that's all right. 
 Perhaps you can help me. 
 I'm looking for a woman. 
 So am I. 
 I don't mean to s-sound rude, but... you are terrifying. 
 Could you stay there? 
 I'm warning you, my husband is in this car, and he will defend me to the death. 
 Isn't that right, dear? 
 Adrian! 
 Adrian, open this door! 
 Don't just sit there. 
 Do something! 
 Leave her alone! 
 Oh, my... 
 Not one more step! 
 You got pretty hair. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Panting] 
 Are you hurt? 
 No. 
 I'm just angry. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, can I talk to you about something? 
 Oh, God. 
 Are you going to ask me out? 
 [Chuckling] No, but thank you for the enthusiasm. 
 What, then? 
 You know those egg thingies upstairs? 
 Your mom sort of took one. 
 What? 
 Yeah, I was coming out of the bathroom, and I saw her put it in her purse. 
 [Scoffs] That's ridiculous. 
 My mother doesn't steal. 
 Well, does she borrow? 
 No. 
 Why would mother want an egg thingy? 
 I don't know why anyone would want half of the crap in this house, but if Mrs. Powell finds that it's missing, she might think that... 
 You stole it. 
 And then she'd fire me. 
 And just so you know, I'm gonna ask you out next week, so try to act [Chuckling] surprised. 
 What are you doing with that? 
 Good morning to you, too, Opal. 
 That belongs to Dahlia. 
 I told you not to touch her things. 
 No, you said I needed permission to move her things, so I spoke to Nicholas last night. 
 And what did he say? 
 It's a bit of a surprise, actually. 
 I just wanted to put Dahlia's things in the garage, but he said to get rid of them entirely. 
 What? 
 The folks at goodwill sent a truck. 
 I guess this got left behind. 
 [Gasps] 
 No! 
 [Gasps] 
 [Sobs] 
 Look, Opal... 
 You had no right! 
 Oh, for God's sake... 
 Those were not your things, and this is not your house! 
 And then she screams, "this isn't your house!" 
 She didn't! 
 Yeah. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I am seriously thinking about asking Nick to fire her. 
 Eh. 
 What? 
 How long has she been working for Nicholas? 
 About 20 years. 
 And how long have you been living there? 
 I see where you're going with this, but I'm not some houseguest. 
 I'm the future Mrs. Deering, and if I politely ask a maid to clean out a closet, I think she should do it. 
 Eh. 
 God, that is annoying. 
 Look, when you work in a house for 20 years, you start to think of it as your own. 
 Like this place... 
 My name may not be on the deed, but... 
 It's my home. 
 I get that. 
 But Opal freaked out on me, and now I have to walk on eggshells in my own home? 
 In that case, you should fire her. 
 Thank you. 
 If she's leaving eggshells on the floor... 
 A maid can be bitchy, but she's still got to clean up. 
 Anyway, I think you should go back to Opal and apologize. 
 Seriously?! 
 It's a chance to clear the air, and if she doesn't start to behave, then talk to Nicholas. 
 I hope you're right. 
 I don't want to be one of these Beverly Hills divas that's always complaining about her maid. 
 It's already happened, hasn't it? 
 Mm... mm... 
 [Papers thud] You never read the contract? 
 It's my first phony marriage! 
 Now, give me a break. 
 Just tell me, my album, my tour... 
 I still get all that, right, even if we're just engaged? 
 Hold on. 
 I'm reading. 
 How could Alejandro do this to me? 
 You know, promises were made, hearts were crossed. 
 I thought we really meant something to each other. 
 Why? It's a fake relationship. 
 And we were gonna live a long fake life together, okay? 
 Mm. 
 Oh! Here it is. 
 "The terms of this contract will not be binding "until such time as the undersigned and the artist are legally joined." 
 So, what does that mean? 
 It means if you don't get married, you get bubkes. 
 No, no, no! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why can't he just marry me and have gay s*x on the weekends like every other husband in Hollywood? 
 Look, I know you got a lot riding on this, but it's time to start facing reality. 
 No. 
 I am Carmen luna, and I never face reality. 
 I just talked to my lawyer. 
 I told him I don't want alimony or the house, so there's no reason this thing has to get ugly. 
 [Tucker babbling] 
 And I'm sorry I hurt you. 
 I didn't mean to fall in love with Rosie. 
 [Toy clacking] 
 I'm a star. 
 Men don't leave stars for maids. 
 Well, this one's going to, but I won't tell anyone why. 
 We'll just let people believe we're another Hollywood casualty. 
 If you continue seeing Rosie, trust me... 
 You'll be the casualty. 
 What exactly do you think that you can do to me? 
 I'm America's sweetheart, remember? 
 My tear-stained face will be on the cover of every tabloid. 
 I'll tell anyone who will listen my husband seduced the maid while our baby was asleep in the next room. 
 Once I'm done, you'll be the most hated man in show business. 
 Your career as daytime TV's nicest doctor will be over. 
 I don't care about that. 
 Do you care about our son? 
 Because I also plan on moving to Europe and taking Tucker with me. 
 I will not allow that. 
 I will fight you in court. 
 And you'll lose. 
 You're the scum shacking up with the maid, remember? 
 A judge won't let you go to Europe, not when you're about to give birth to our brand-new baby. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Joke's on you. 
 I'm not pregnant. 
 That was just a maneuver designed to save our marriage. 
 Oh, well. 
 [Tucker babbles] 
 You're a monster. 
 And yet I seem so nice in my films. 
 [Grunts] 
 To recap, if you see Rosie again, even one more time, I will destroy you. 
 Got it... 
 [As Rosie] Mr. Spence? 
 Opal, I was hoping we could talk. 
 Did you know I'm writing a book? 
 It's about what I went through to get my son out of jail. 
 I had to work as a maid for six months, so you'd think I would remember to respect the people who do this job. 
 You've taken such beautiful care of Dahlia's things for all these years I should have spoken to you before I gave them away. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I was 19 when I met Dahlia. 
 I was single, pregnant... 
 And terrified. 
 She offered to take me in and give me a job. 
 She was more than an employer. 
 She was my friend. 
 It's been 15 years since she died, and I... 
 I still grieve for her. 
 I am so sorry. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Voice breaking] No. 
 I should apologize to you. 
 The way I've been behaving, it's... unacceptable. 
 So... maybe we can start over. 
 I would like that. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, well, well. 
 You are a difficult woman to find. 
 Do I know you? 
 No. 
 But I know you. 
 You're a thief. 
 Somebody gave this to me. 
 Well, now you're going to give it to me... 
 Whether you like it or not. 
 Mr. Kenneth, I fixed your robe. 
 Now we can get you ready for your birthday dinner. 
 I love birthdays. 
 My favorite part is the presents. 
 I wish I knew you better so I could give you something you'd like. 
 You know what, Mr. Kenneth? 
 I think I know what you'd like for your birthday. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Of getting to the bottom of this... 
 What in the world? 
 Uncle Ken? 
 [Chuckles] Look at you! 
 Rosie, did you do this? 
 I thought Mr. Kenneth would like to dress up for a change. 
 That was very thoughtful. 
 Yeah! 
 [Voice breaking] 
 I can't remember the last time Kenny looked this nice. 
 Are you done performing? 
 Excuse me?! 
 Reggie is the executor of daddy's estate. 
 Every time he stops by, Didi turns on the waterworks to impress him. 
 You are such a liar. 
 You could put daddy in a suit any time you want! 
 And when was the last time you did something nice for him? 
 I gave up my whole life for him. 
 Now who's performing? 
 Okay, ladies, please... 
 Rosie, go ahead and serve dinner. 
 No. 
 I want to do presents first. 
 Rosie, do as I say. 
 Rosie, this is my house. 
 She's just an elderly guest. 
 No one asked you, Ambrosia. 
 You work for me, remember? 
 No, she works for me. 
 You know, I'm sick of this. 
 Just go to hell! 
 Back off, bitch! 
 [Panting] 
 [Sighs] 
 I think that means I work for him. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Hey, mija, what's up? 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Ho... ho... hold on. 
 Slow down! 
 Your mother did what? 
 What the hell were you thinking?! 
 I wanted her out of that house. 
 That's your excuse for stealing? 
 Do you want your daughter to be a maid, to watch while she throws her life away? 
 It's her life to throw! 
 I know what I'm talking about. 
 I had a chance to go to college. 
 I thought that scholarship would always be there... 
 Yeah, I know... your life didn't turn out the way you wanted. 
 How does that justify trying to get your own daughter fired?! 
 All right! 
 I'm sorry! 
 It just happened! 
 I don't know what I was thinking. 
 I do. 
 You were thinking you could control everything under the sun... 
 The world according to Zoila... 
 Pablo. 
 Always making us jump through your hoops. 
 Valentina and I have been doing it for years, and we're sick of it! 
 I mean, we love you, but, God, you make us so unhappy! 
 You're unhappy? 
 Since when? 
 Since as long as I can remember. 
 Oh. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm taking this back to Valentina. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Mrs. Powell? 
 I believe this belongs to you. 
 Tony! 
 [Gasps] 
 How in the world...? 
 [Gasps] I have my ways. 
 Oh [Chuckles] 
 Here. Allow me. 
 [Sighs] 
 When those men broke into our home, they stole so much more than this necklace. 
 They took our dignity, our sense of security... 
 Now I feel like I've gotten some of those things back. 
 I'm glad. 
 Oh, how can I ever repay you? 
 Seeing you smile is payment enough. 
 "ET" has just learned that longtime couple Spence and Peri Westmore are calling it quits. 
 Although the couple issued a statement saying the divorce will be amicable, rumors are swirling that the hunky soap star may have cheated on America's sweetheart. 
 And, of course, we'll always keep you updated for the latest on this story. [Doorbell rings] Rosie, what are you doing here? I saw the TV. They were talking about you and Mrs. Peri. Look, I can't talk right now. I just wanted to see if you were okay. Not really. Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow, tell me what happened? No, I don't. As a matter of fact, uh, I can't see you again. Why? My family is breaking up because of you. I'm very upset. You have to stay away. I'm sorry. You know, my meetings are only during the days. You sure you don't want to come with me? San Francisco sounds fun, but I have a lot of writing to do. Okay. I guess I'm just worried about you being all alone in the house with Opal. Well, I told you, we're good now. By the time you get back, we're gonna be besties. Oh, now I'm definitely worried. [Both chuckle] See you in a week. Okay. [Sighs] [Speaking indistinctly] Alejandro! Where's your tie? Well, isn't this a casual thing? No! No. [Chuckles] This is our engagement party. We have to look nice. Ah, geez. [Sighs] I should have called the whole thing off. What... you know, the more I think about Dario... You seem tense... The more that I'm... While you get a tie... I'm thinking black... I'll get you a beverage. Okay. So, that's Alejandro, huh? Keep his glass full, make every drink a double, and if he orders water, put vodka in it. Why do you need him drunk? You're paid to pour, not to ask questions. When I give the cue, this is what I need you to say. Here. I'll give you an extra $50 if you stop judging me. Oh! You got the white flowers. Perfect. Carmen. Why did you give the bartender money? What are you up to? Nothing. Why do you always think I'm up to something? [Door opens] Father Tomas! I'm so glad you could come. [Door opens] [Door closes] What's with the suitcase? You might want to sit down. I need some space. I found a little apartment. Not too expensive. So, you're leaving me? I'm taking a break. A break? Zoila, if I stay in this house, the way I'm feeling about you, we're not gonna make it. Oh. So, I just need to [Sighs] take a few months. Trust me. It's gonna be good for both of us. I'll give you a call when I get settled, okay? [Voice breaking] And I promise to eat healthy. [Door closes] [Upbeat music playing, indistinct conversations] Hey. How are you feeling? Pretty hammered. What the hell's in these drinks? Who cares? It's time to make our toast. Mm. Okay. [Music stops] Hello, everyone! Hey! Hi! Hi! Hi! [Exhales sharply] Alejandro and I are so happy to have you with us on this special night. I wish you could all feel the passion we have for each other. Aww! I don't feel so good. Neither do I. [Chuckles] Waiting and waiting for the big day. Are you as excited about the wedding as we are? [Cheers and applause] But I guess we have to wait a few more weeks. Aw! Aw! Aw! Aw! What else can we do? Why don't you get married now? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Get married now? [Chuckling] That's crazy! I mean, we don't have anyone here to marry us, right? I could do it. Oh, my God! Father Tomas? Who invited you? [Chuckles] Oh, dear God. Wedding! Wedding! [Chanting] Wedding! Wedding! Wedding! Wedding! Aah! [Cheers and applause] What the hell's going on? [Crowd murmuring] We're giving the people what they want. [Crowd cheers] Carmen, we need to talk about this. Yeah, we'll talk on the honeymoon. We need to talk now. Take five, padre. Nobody leave! [Chuckles] Let's do this. Listen. Listen. We have to get married! Why? Because if we don't... I get nothing. What are you talking about? Read the contract, Alejandro! You know, my album, my tour... If you run off with Dario, it... it all goes away. [Sighing] Oh... Baby, I won't let that happen. You won't? I should have been clearer. I will personally see to it that my label honors our deal... Oh, my God. Not just because you're an amazing friend, but because I believe in your talent. You're a star waiting to happen, Ms. Carmen Luna. [Inhales sharply] You are the best husband I never married. [Chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. [Guests screaming] [Indistinct shouting] Shut up! Get down on the ground! Get down! [Shouting continues] I'm not screwing around, people! [Grunts] [Screams] What did you do?! Let's go. Let's go. Get out of here now! [Panting] Oh. [Voice breaking] Somebody call 911, please! Oh, my God. You shot him! It was an accident. I didn't see him! Well, do you think we should go back to see if he's okay? Are you crazy? The cops are gonna be here any minute. [Engine turns over] The ambulance is on its way. [Sobbing] He's not saying anything, and there's so much blood. [Sobs] Why? [Sobbing loudly]
