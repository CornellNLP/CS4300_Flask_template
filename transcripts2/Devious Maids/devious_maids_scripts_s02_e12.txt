 Previously on "Devious Maids"... 
 She took my kid. 
 Drinking won't get him back. 
 You're my maid, Carmen. 
 Not my mom. 
 Go to rehab. 
 When you get back... 
 I will be here waiting for you. 
 What's wrong? 
 There's a problem with my kidneys. 
 Seems the little buggers are starting to shut down. 
 My father kicked me out of this house because of you. 
 I don't want her to leave. 
 It's Didi. 
 What's going on? 
 Uncle Ken asked me and his business managers to inform Didi that he wants a divorce. 
 We have to get you out of here before Reggie sends you away. 
 This man isn't supposed to have visitors. 
 Mr. Kenneth was getting stronger. 
 He wanted to take back control of his business, so you made him fall. 
 There's an immigration hearing next week. 
 It could go well for you and your son... 
 Or not so well. 
 I want us to hit another house. 
 Are you high? 
 Last time we went out, Carter killed somebody. 
 [Screams] [Crowd screaming] 
 We've got to get out of here! 
 Did you tell someone? 
 Valentina. 
 If she tells someone... 
 I don't think she will. 
 But I'm getting out just in case. 
 You might want to do the same. 
 We call the police now. 
 I can't turn Ethan in! 
 I spent 14 months in jail. 
 Please don't make the same mistake I did. 
 I've decided to tell the police about Ethan. 
 You're doing the right thing. 
 Good morning, Javier. 
 So, Javier's a good guy? 
 He's great. 
 But today, I was thanking God for you. 
 Who did you kill, Nick? 
 I'm not a murderer. 
 Opal, no! 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Siren wails] 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Just... I had no idea she was that crazy. 
 We're so sorry. 
 Mrs. Deering, your husband's here. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Opal is dead. 
 What? 
 She shot herself last night. 
 Here? Wh... 
 Oh, my God. 
 And now we need to talk. 
 To witness something like that... 
 I can't imagine. 
 It was awful. 
 Oh. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 I-I-I thought under the circumstances... 
 I learned something last night. 
 What's that? 
 It was Opal who pushed Dahlia off the bridge. 
 At first, I was relieved, but then it occurred to me, "why would you keep her secret all these years unless you had a secret of your own?" 
 And it would have to be pretty terrible for you to let your wife's death to go unpunished. 
 So... 
 Maybe you did kill someone. 
 Okay, the house is full of strangers. 
 Can we discuss it later? 
 I won't be here later. 
 Where was Opal staying? 
 Some apartment. 
 Why? 
 I-I-I gave her a watch once that belonged to my grandmother. 
 I'd like to get it back. 
 Y-you don't know the address? 
 She banks at Beverly pacific. 
 I'm sure they'll know where she was staying. 
 So... 
 You're not gonna tell me what you did? 
 It's not what you think. 
 So, how did it go? 
 All he would talk about is Opal's apartment. 
 Why? 
 She was blackmailing him, maybe she had some physical proof of what he did. 
 You need to get to that apartment before Nick does. 
 Do you know where she was staying? 
 As a matter of fact, I do. 
 [sighs] 
 Morning. 
 Oh, crap. 
 Did we have s*x last night? 
 No. 
 Oh, thank you, lord. 
 We made love. 
 Oh. 
 [Sighs] Thanks for nothing. 
 [Sighs] 
 Mami! 
 [Gasps] Oh! 
 Mija, what are you doing here? 
 I have to meet with the police at 9:00 to talk to them about Ethan. 
 Is it okay that I crashed here last night? 
 Of course. 
 I just wish you'd called me first. 
 Two cups of coffee, huh? 
 Yeah, the doctor thinks I need more caffeine in my diet. 
 [Chuckles] Come on. 
 I know you had company. 
 You do? 
 Well, I can explain. 
 It's okay. 
 I really like Javier. 
 Who? 
 Oh, right. Javier. 
 [Chuckles] 
 He's so sweet. I don't think you could have picked a nicer guy. 
 Yeah, I'd be a fool to mess that up. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 And papi left you. 
 I think that means you can sleep with whoever you want. 
 Morning. 
 Mami? 
 Hold that thought, sweetness. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What are you doing here? 
 I picked up some pastelitos. 
 I thought we could have breakfast together. 
 Fantastic! 
 But we should eat them in the park. 
 Why? 
 Food tastes better outside. 
 You're a chef. 
 You should know that! 
 If anyone should ask where I've gone, anyone at all, 
 I'll be back soon. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, mija! 
 Dad?! 
 Got exciting news... 
 Looks like your mom and I are back together. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 I must say I was surprised to get your call. 
 It's been ages. 
 And I feel awful about that. 
 I do enjoy you and Evelyn so much. 
 Are you sure there's not another reason for this visit? 
 I detected a hint of desperation in your voice when you called. 
 It's true. 
 I'm here because I need something. 
 Then you came to the right place. 
 I never could say no to a pretty face. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What is it you need? 
 A kidney. 
 Beg pardon? 
 I have renal failure, so I'm asking people to get tested in the hopes someone will be a match and give me their kidney. 
 Well? 
 Uh, it would be one thing if you were going to ask to use my jet or my yacht, but this is a major organ we're talking about, one I've grown quite fond of. 
 I know it's a big favor. 
 That's why I'm only asking my closest friends. 
 Now might be a good time to point out, we're not that close. 
 But don't you remember the Bermans' Christmas party? 
 We talked in the corner the whole night. 
 You said we had an amazing connection. 
 Honestly, I was hitting on you. 
 No. Oh, yes. I'm very skeevy. 
 Well, it was a long time ago. 
 I'm willing to forgive you. 
 That seems misguided. 
 I have no choice. 
 My condition's getting worse. 
 Please help me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But if there was anything else I could do for you... 
 Well [Sighs] I would like to get away for the weekend. 
 [Sighs] 
 Could you loan me your yacht? 
 [Chuckles] Oh, sweetheart. 
 No. 
 [Grunting] 
 Miguel. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 In, papito. 
 Now, this is very serious. 
 Mr. Kenneth is in trouble. 
 Someone is stealing from him. 
 His treasure? 
 Yes. Someone is stealing his treasure... 
 A bad man... 
 And I need to stop him. 
 The problem is, this bad man will be angry. 
 He may try to send us back to Mexico. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Sometimes in life, we have to choose between what is good for us and what is the right thing to do. 
 Do you understand? 
 [Voice breaking] And I know how much you want to stay in this country. 
 [Sniffles] 
 So I am asking for your permission. 
 Will you let me fight this very bad man? 
 You will need a sword. 
 [Sniffles] 
 What's going on? 
 Oh, the cops are breaking into Ethan's locker. 
 They've got a warrant and everything. 
 A warrant? 
 Yeah, people are saying he was a part of that home-invasion ring. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Wow. 
 That's messed up. 
 Yeah, they're talking to kids now, trying to figure out who else was part of it. 
 You guys knew Ethan, right? 
 Not really. 
 We should bounce. 
 We're gonna be late for chemistry. 
 This is bad. 
 What if Carmen finds out? 
 Who the hell is Carmen? 
 That girl I told you about. 
 Don't worry about her. 
 Worry about going to jail. 
 I know. I know. 
 God, we just... 
 We got to come up with a plan. 
 Well, until we do, stay cool, okay? 
 Hey, Spence. 
 How are you? 
 How's rehab going? 
 Aww, that's great. 
 Me? 
 I'm so busy. [Chuckles] 
 You know, sweeping and mopping and... polishing. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 There's the door. 
 I should go. 
 Listen, keep up the good work, okay? 
 Bye! 
 Hi. 
 This is Spence Westmore's house, right? 
 Who are you, and what is that? 
 I'm Gavin... Peri Westmore's personal assistant. 
 And this is her son. 
 Do you know where Spence is? 
 He's at re... 
 Rehearsal for a show. 
 I thought the baby was with Peri in Rome. 
 Well, he was, but Peri's nanny got arrested for shoplifting. 
 Really? If you knew what Peri paid us, you wouldn't be that shocked. 
 Uh, long story short, the movie wraps in a week, and until then, Peri needs Spence to take care of the baby. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 Spence isn't here, and I hate kids. 
 Oh, you don't have to love him. 
 Just keep him alive. 
 I can't promise that. 
 Lady, please. 
 Peri's got some nerve. 
 Didn't she just sue for custody of Tucker? 
 Well, she says if Spence does this for her, she's willing to reconsider the entire custody ruling. 
 Oh. 
 Well... I guess I could watch him until Spence gets back. 
 I'm sure you'll do a wonderful job. 
 Hey. 
 Where's his cage? 
 Cage? 
 You know, the thing you keep children in so they can't get away. 
 You mean his playpen? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 I'll need one of those. 
 I'll have one delivered. 
 Good lucky. 
 Thanks. 
 I was talking to the baby. 
 ♪ 
 We have to get rid of everything. 
 What? Do you mean, like, the guns? 
 The guns, the masks, the van... 
 Anything that ties us to the robberies. 
 Look, let's not just panic. 
 Okay, the cops haven't arrested Ethan. 
 [Door opens] Damn it! Why isn't he texting me back? [Door closes] 
 You can forget about that. 
 Ethan took off. 
 Took off? Why? 
 Valentina knows about the robberies. 
 He told his girlfriend? 
 She figured it out. 
 Did she go to the police? 
 Who knows? 
 If Ethan told her about us, we're dead. 
 I'm starting to think it's time we all get the hell out of dodge. 
 If Valentina doesn't know that we're involved and if Ethan is in the wind... 
 There are a lot of "ifs" in that sentence. 
 Guys, let me just talk to Valentina. 
 Then we'll know for sure what we have to do. 
 [Gasps] Rosie! 
 Thank God you're here! 
 I came as soon as I could. 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't think I can do this anymore. 
 You have to get him out of here. 
 Who are you talking about? 
 Him! 
 Is that Tucker Westmore? 
 You call him Tucker. 
 I call him El diablo! Why? [Chuckles] He's been here two hours, and he's already broken a lamp, spit on my shoe, and what he did to that diaper was pure evil! Eh, don't pretend to be cute just because she's here. Carmen, why did you call me? I need you to take him. What?! Kids drive me crazy... All the drooling and the crying. And this one has been trying to talk, but who can understand him? His diction is worse than mine. I would love to babysit Tucker, but I can't. I have an important meeting. Seriously? I'm not doing so well. I'll take him as soon as I can. I promise. I'll call you. Thank you. I'm sorry that I'm acting like this, but ever since Tucker got here, I've been moody and tired and crabby. [Chuckles] Why are you smiling? 'Cause now you know what it's like to be a mother. [Chuckles] Hey! Did you come by for a little visit? I came to congratulate you. Dad says you two are getting back together. [Chuckles] Obviously, your father's confused. Mm. Well, maybe that's because you slept with him! Okay! Calm down. Your father and I are still married, so from the church's perspective... Don't go all catholic on me because I will call the pope and tell him about Javier. Is this what they taught you in catechism... blackmail? Look, if you don't want papi back,  you have to tell him. - That's the problem. I'm not sure! Ay, mami! Last night opened up a lot of old feelings, and it's gonna take me a while to sort through them. Well, while you're sorting, you need to tell Javier what you did and beg his forgiveness. He won't have to forgive me if he never finds out, and my logic is pretty sound on that. Did it hurt when you found out dad was seeing Helen before he broke up with you? Yeah. Then guess what... You're doing the same thing to Javier, which means you're no better than dad. This is, like, the worst visit ever. Please tell Javier what's going on. It's the right thing to do. Why did I raise you so well? [Chuckles] [Indistinct conversations] Miss Lucinda, you came. I don't know why after the way you stabbed me in the back. What is it you want? It wasn't me who got you kicked out of the house. Who, then? I'll explain everything as soon as we're all seated. What do you mean "all"? Rosie, who else is coming? Hello, chubbs. Hey, syphilis. Hold on, you two. Shouldn't you be at the nursing home looking for a new husband? Shouldn't you be cutting the line at an all-you-can-eat buffet?! Stop it! You two can't be fighting now. Mr. Kenneth is in trouble, and he needs you. What's happened? He's in the hospital, and Reggie put him there. What do you mean? I'll tell you, but only if you both promise to behave, all right? [Sighs] What are you doing in here? Oh, you scared me! Good. I'm Dolores. I'm the landlady, and this is not your apartment. I'm Marisol, a friend of Opal's. I don't know if you heard... Yeah, I heard. Cops said she shot herself. In my home. Oh, honey. Well, I'm glad she didn't blow her brains out here. Try renting that apartment. What an... Interesting point. So, how did you get in here? Opal's keys, uh, were in her purse. Oh, you better return those. Copies are expensive. Don't let these clothes fool you. I'm not made of money. Sure. As soon as I'm done. You're not here to take her stuff, are you? 'Cause it's a bit early to be picking the bones clean. No, I'm not interested in Opal's things. Not even that vase? It looks expensive. No. Just so you know, I collect vases. It was lovely to meet you, Dolores. And I will get you those keys just as soon as I am done. Yeah, but I... Take care. [Sighs] So, what is this important thing you wanted to talk about? I wanted to talk about... Us. My favorite subject. I think that one of the reasons we work so well together is because we're always honest, we don't keep secrets. Oh, no. Yeah. So... Damn it. [Chuckles] She told you, didn't she? Hmm? I knew Genevieve couldn't keep her mouth shut, but I needed to make sure you could get the time off. I didn't want to buy two tickets to Paris and then find out you couldn't go. Oh, my God. We're going to Paris? Isn't that the secret you wanted to talk about? Yes. Yes, it is. Then why do you sound so surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm excited! Oh, my God. We're going to Paris! [Chuckles] You said you've never been and that you always wanted to see it. When did I say that? Our third date... At that little bistro in Santa Monica. You remember that? Hey. You okay? [Voice breaking] Sure. I'm... I'm just very happy. Happier than I deserve to be. So, you're not mad at me for trying to surprise you? No. There are some things that should be kept secret. ♪ 
 
 [Door opens] [Door closes] Marisol. Nick. Hi. I was just, um, looking for something. Judging by the condition of the room, I guess you didn't find it. I wasn't sure what I was looking for. How's that? I'm searching for evidence. You know, that thing that proves you did whatever it was you did. And you didn't find it? No. And thanks for not denying its existence. For the sake of argument, uh, let's say I did something... a long time ago, something that was wrong. Yeah, let's say that. And if it was an accident, something I've shed tears over, would that change your opinion of me? What am I supposed to say? Say you'll forgive me. You don't get absolution before the confession. It'd be easier to confess to someone who still loved me. I don't know how I feel about you anymore because... I don't know who you are. Well... At least you're honest. [Door opens] Whatever Opal had on you... I'm going to find it. [Sighs] You'll wish you hadn't. [Door closes] Yeah. Hi. This is Carmen Luna. I got your message about the audition. Is it possible that I go in tomorrow instead? I have some... Child-care issues. [Sighs] Okay, no, no, no. I don't want to cancel. I'll be there in an hour, then. [Sighs] Okay, thanks. [Sighs] Hey, diablo. How am I supposed to take you to an audition? [Tucker coos] Stay. Hey. Did you just audition for the salsa commercial? Yeah. I think I nailed it. [Chuckles] Good for you. Listen, could you do me a favor and watch my kid for five minutes? Are you auditioning, too? I am. Then no. Are you Carmen Luna? Yeah. You're late. Let's go. Thank you for this opportunity. I am very excited. Great. Why don't you slate first, and then we'll take it from the top. Whenever you're ready. Hi. I'm Carmen Luna, and I am auditioning for the Rosada salsa jingle. [Latin music plays] ♪ On a chip, on some eggs ♪ 
♪ Add some zip, give it legs ♪ 
♪ Rosada ♪ 
♪ Salsa ♪ [Trucker crying] ♪ Baked potato, piece of fish ♪ 
♪ Take your pick, it's delish ♪ 
♪ Rosada ♪ [Music stops] ♪ Salsa ♪ Hold on. Hold... hold on! ♪ Salsa ♪ Stop! [Crying continues] Is that a baby crying? Oh, it's okay. [Chuckles] He's fine. That's your kid? Mm-hmm. Who's watching him? Well, he's very independent. [Door opens] [Whimpers] What kind of monster are you? A talented one? ♪ How's he doing? Wonderful, but he's getting sleepy. Oh, now you're getting sleepy? You couldn't you take a nap yesterday, you audition killer? [Tucker coos] I still can't believe you tied him up. What? I-I was desperate, all right? That's why I needed your help, Rosie. I can't deal with kids. You'll get the hang of it once you have kids of your own. [Chuckles] Please. I'm never having kids. How can you say that? 'Cause I don't want them. I have a career to worry about. Well, I don't get that, but... okay. You're like every other woman that has kids, you know? They find out that I don't have the "mom gene," and they look down on me. I don't mean to insult you. It's just... I love having a child. Miguel makes me very happy. You know what I love having? A dream. And the day my dream comes true, I'm gonna be as happy as you are. What if it doesn't come true? What? Well, lots of people have dreams that don't work out, or they get their dream and then it goes wrong. That's not gonna happen to me. But what if it does? Won't you need something else in your life, something that'll give you joy? My dream is gonna come true. How can you be so sure? It just has to. [Woman sobbing] Zoila! Did you talk to Javier? Did he have anything interesting to say? Yeah, he told me about the trip. Have you been crying? Just a little. Oh, Zoila, you're gonna love Paris. Forget Paris. What's wrong? I haven't had any luck finding a donor, and the doctor says I'm gonna need a kidney very soon. Oh, honey. And it hit me... One of these days, I could actually die. That never occurred to you? I guess I didn't think it through. Oh, I don't want to die just yet, not while I still look so good. I've got an idea. Why not let me get tested? Zoila, no. You asked every other friend you have. But you work for me. I wouldn't want you to feel I'm forcing you. After all these years, do you still not get it? I'd do that for you. [Exhales deeply] [Sniffles] Hi. [Chuckles] I left earlier without returning your keys. I'm so sorry. Oh, don't worry about it. Come on in. So, did you find what you were looking for? No. Do you have any extra storage here at the building? I wish. People would pay through the nose for that. Well, thanks anyway. Hey, this silver key isn't mine. It's not? No. It's got, uh, "Beverly Pacific" stamped on it. Opal's bank. Of course. Hey! Don't think you can go snooping around someone's safe-deposit box. That's illegal. Isn't that Opal's vase? Lovely to meet you. Who are you? Her name is Esperanza. She's your new maid. My new maid? Hola. ¿Como esta? I called the agency, they sent her over. I didn't realize you'd be leaving so soon. You won't miss me. She's very good at her job. I trust you'll keep quiet about what you've seen in this house. When I came here, I saw how broken this family was. I thought I could help put it back together. But Mrs. Didi and miss Lucinda don't care about Mr. Kenneth, and he seems ready to die. So, take all his money. There is nothing I can do to stop you. You make me sound so evil. I don't know the English word for what you are. All I ask is that you don't mess with my immigration. I want my son to grow up in this country. And you'll keep quiet about my... creative accounting? I will. Oh, and, uh... I don't want this. Keep it... As a reminder of what your life could have been like. Well? He's so dumb. [Chuckles] [Chuckles] Let's do this. [Chuckles] [Engine turns over] Okay, uh, give me 10 minutes. I'll be right over. Was that the hospital? Some of the people that promised mom they'd get tested didn't show up. I have to go see what's going on. Do what you need to. [Sighs] You know, it really helps a lot knowing you're here. I'm glad. [Chuckles] Call me later. Yeah. Oh! I am really sorry! That's okay. Let me buy you another cup. Miss, when you have a second? You don't have to do that. It's no big deal. Hey! Aren't you Valentina... Ethan's girlfriend? Do I know you? I go to school with him. He's always talking about you. He even has a picture of you in his locker. [Chuckles] Oh. You know... Everybody at school is saying the cops are looking for him. Was he really part of that robbery ring? I don't want to talk about it. Oh, come on. He must have said something. You can trust me. I won't tell anyone. Forget about the coffee. I have to be somewhere. Geez, I'm just worried about him. That's all. I hope you're not gonna say anything to the cops. E-excuse me? He could go to jail, along with those other guys. You'd ruin a lot of people's lives. Since you asked, I already told the police everything I know. You did? I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Forget it. Sorry to bother you. ♪ Hey! I told you you're not allowed up here. You said only family could visit. Well, this is Mr. Kenneth's family. I'm Lucinda, his daughter, and this is my father's wife, Didi. We're taking him home. Not without authorization, you're not. I'm calling Reggie. Just tell me one thing. How much is he paying you? It's okay. We're prepared to negotiate. Rosie's told us everything. We've come back to help you. I c-can't believe it. After the way I've treated you both? That's the first thing you learn in a family... How to forgive. [Sobbing] [Sniffles] Thank you. Thank you for your help. Oh, no. Thank you. [Door opens] Sorry I'm late. It's fine. I let myself in. I was at the hospital getting tested. I don't know if you heard about Genevieve. I have. So, you'd really give her one of your kidneys? Sure, if I'm a match, which is doubtful, but you know how I feel about her. What are those for? [Chuckles] The other night. Yeah, about that... Come on, you can't tell me you didn't have a great time, 'cause I was there. I heard you. Yeah, well... [Chuckling] Hell, the neighbors heard you. Okay! We had some fun. Please don't read too much into it. You don't want to take me back? I don't think so. But I just broke up with Helen. I'm sorry. Zoila, I messed up. I admit that. But if I had any doubts about us, the other night took them away. We can still be great together. You know what my problem is? I don't forget so easy. Then focus on the good times. There were a lot of them. Believe me. I don't want to throw out 20 years' worth of memories. But when I think about what you did to me, how can I trust you? So, you'd rather be with Javier? Maybe. I don't know. Look, look. Look, look, look! I'll do whatever you want. I'll get on my knees. I'll make some grand, romantic gesture. Just please, Zoila, don't shut the door. I think I'll be out of town next week. Let's talk about it after. [Sighs] What... what do you mean, you lost him?! H-he's a 65-year-old stroke victim. He couldn't just walk out! Someone must have taken him. I need to call you back. You have five seconds to tell me where my uncle is. I mean it, Rosie! If you don't tell me, I will call the cops. Good... Since we were gonna call them anyway. Uncle Ken, I've... I've been so worried. You can relax now. We've been taking good care of him. You shouldn't have taken him out of the hospital. I'm his legal guardian. Not anymore, you're not. Mr. Kenneth has taken back his power of attorney. And that's allowed us to investigate. We know what you've been up to, Reggie. I was shocked, and I used to be a stripper. N-none of you are making any sense. We have proof, Reggie, which we got off the files on your computer. My computer hasn't left this house. And that gave me a lot of time to go through it, so thank you. Esperanza is actually a [Clicks tongue] What is the English word? Forensic accountant. And she's been going over the mess you've made of Kenny's estate. So, we know you've been stealing from daddy hand over fist. That's a lie. Mr. Miller, I have statements from all your accounts, even the ones in the Cayman Islands. I told you she was good at her job. This is all a big misunderstanding. I did move some money around, but I was investing it... For you... For the family. You shouldn't use that word, since you don't know what it means. We'll understand if you want to get the hell out of here. Don't worry. We'll be seeing you in court. You might want to pack your bags... 'Cause I am gonna see to it you are thrown out of this country. ♪ [Cellphone rings] Hello? Oh. Hi, Dr. Kimball. Um, she's actually resting right now. Can I ask what this is about? Mom! Mom! Wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up. What is it? I-is something wrong? No! Dr. Kimball's on the phone, and he has amazing news. You've got to talk to him right now. [Clears throat] Hello, doctor. Mrs. Delatour, sorry to bother you, but I wanted to tell you right away... We found a donor. [Chuckling] Are you serious? Absolutely. We confirmed the tests. It's a perfect match. [Gasps] Someone is willing to give me a kidney? Who is this angel? Actually, I think you know him. He's married to your maid. Valentina talked to the cops? What did she tell them? I couldn't ask her that. She was starting to get suspicious. Of him? Oh, this is great. There's no reason to panic, okay? My dad's a lawyer. I know this stuff. Even if we went to trial, what would they use as evidence? Are you joking? They know about Ethan. But Ethan's gone, okay? Unless the cops can tie us to the robberies with physical evidence... Which they can't get because we got rid of everything. So the only thing they've got is Valentina's testimony of something her boyfriend told her. And that wouldn't be enough to convict us... Would it? There's only one way to be sure. What's that? We have to get rid of Valentina. This is it, Carmen. I can feel it. Shh! Not so loud. I just got the baby down. Whatever Opal had on Nick is in that box. Then what are you waiting for? Go get it. I can't. I'm not Opal. But you have the key? That's not the way safe-deposit boxes work. The bank manager has a key, too. It takes both to open the box. Oh. Then what are you gonna do? [Sighs] How good are you at makeup? Clearly, I'm fantastic. Why? Can you make me look... Like this? [Clears throat] [Clears throat] Good afternoon. I want to get into my safe-deposit box, please. Okay. I'll just need an I.D. Would you mind removing your sunglasses, please? You know, you're much prettier in person. Thank God you feel that way. Thank you. My pleasure. Just ring the bell when you're done. [Gasps] [Gasps] Oh, my God.
