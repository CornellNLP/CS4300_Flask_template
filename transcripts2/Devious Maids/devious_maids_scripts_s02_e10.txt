 Previously on "Devious Maids"... 
 This place has more doors than a whorehouse. 
 Hello, mother. 
 Everyone called her the butterball express. 
 Not everyone, mother. 
 Just you. 
 I'm going to the Four Seasons for a few weeks. 
 Who's gonna take care of your mother? 
 Zoila! 
 I hope in time, you'll find a way to forgive me. 
 I also plan on moving to Europe and taking Tucker with me. 
 I will not allow that. 
 I will fight you in court. 
 And you'll lose. 
 You're the scum shacking up with the maid, remember? 
 Before I go into surgery tomorrow, I need you to do something. 
 Anything you want. 
 Marry me. 
 You may kiss the bride. 
 You got some sort of letter. 
 Uncle Ken wants a divorce. 
 Because of that letter? 
 Now that he knows she was unfaithful, it's over. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [Crying] 
 I date men. 
 All I see when I look at you is a confused little boy. 
 How does us robbing your Uncle get you this girl? 
 I'm gonna save her life. 
 [Gun shot] Everyone on your knees! 
 [People gasping, screaming] 
 Listen up, morons! 
 If anyone tries anything, we will shoot her! 
 [Screams] 
 [People scream] 
 We've got to get out of here! 
 Stay down! 
 Ethan? 
 What happened to you?! 
 Ethan! 
 All right. 
 Hey. Ethan. Hey. 
 [Groans] We have to go. 
 Ethan, I am begging. 
 Please let me take you to the hospital. 
 No way. 
 But there's so much blood! 
 I'll be fine. 
 Where are we? 
 My mom's house. 
 Don't worry. 
 She's at the Delatours'. 
 So, you've got to tell me, how did this happen? 
 I... 
 I was in a fight. 
 What? 
 We were at the bar drinking, and some guy got in my face. 
 And he stabbed you? 
 And then I cracked a bottle over his head. 
 The cops won't care who started it, so... 
 Just try and stop the bleeding. 
 [Car door closes] 
 What was that? 
 You passed out on our way over here, so I called someone. 
 You did what? 
 He'll be able help you. 
 B-but, Valentina, I... 
 I'm not gonna let you die. 
 And he promised he wouldn't tell anyone. 
 Wait, so who exactly did you call? 
 [Door closes] 
 Would it surprise you to know that that painting cost $200,000? 
 Yes. 
 My Uncle never helped my mom. 
 Not when she lost her job, not when she struggled to put me through school. 
 He was too busy buying fine art. 
 I'm going to sell it. 
 Are you allowed to do that? 
 Sure. 
 I have my Uncle Ken's power of attorney. 
 I'm supposed to make decisions about this house and everything in it. 
 I have to get Mr. Kenneth ready for bed. 
 When you're done, why don't you come to my room? 
 I can't. 
 Why not? We have the house to ourselves now. 
 But... 
 My son might see us. 
 We can lock the door. 
 It wouldn't feel right. 
 Some other time. 
 When Miguel isn't here. 
 Miguel is always here. 
 That is true. 
 What do you think? 
 It should stop the bleeding. 
 For now. 
 Does it hurt? 
 Not that bad. 
 Ow! 
 Oops. 
 Geez, you miss the class on stitches? 
 Oh, I think what you meant to say was, "thank you for saving my life." 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Thanks for helping out. 
 And just so we're clear, I didn't do it for you. 
 Ethan, you should go lay down. 
 My room's at the end of the hall. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Scoffs] 
 Relax. 
 I won't make a move on her while I'm covered with your blood. 
 You've got to check his temperature every 20 minutes, all right? 
 If he starts to get a fever, you've got to get him to the hospital. Understand? 
 I do. 
 All right. 
 Remi. 
 Thank you for tonight. 
 I will never forget it. 
 That story Ethan told you about a knife fight? 
 I think he's lying. 
 I know. 
 [Bell ringing] 
 Velma, enough with the bell. 
 I'm not a dog. 
 I know. 
 A dog would've come quicker. 
 Ugh! 
 Oh, God! 
 You're topless. 
 I'm sunning myself. 
 Haven't you ever seen boobs before? 
 Not down there. 
 Any chance you could cover up while we're talking? 
 Oh, fine. 
 I need a bloody Mary. 
 How about "please"? 
 How about "I'm the boss, so hurry up"? 
 You're not my boss. 
 I work for Genevieve, and when she gets back from her business trip, I will tell her how you've been treating me. 
 My daughter's not on any business trip, and you know it. 
 She's hiding out in some fancy spa where the crappers are made of gold. 
 Okay, she's at a spa resting. 
 You know, because of her... 
 Health problems. 
 No. 
 She thinks if she avoids me long enough, I'll leave. 
 Well, you can tell her I'm not going anywhere. 
 Now get me a bloody Mary. 
 Get it yourself. 
 Oh, God, that's just not fair. 
 This would have been the third home invasion in recent months, but this time, the robbers were thwarted by the heroic actions of quick-thinking housekeeper Carmen Luna. 
 Tell us how you handled that gang of thieves. 
 I stabbed one with a cake knife. 
 That's a bold move on your part. 
 Yeah. I would have stabbed them all, but they ran away like scared little bunnies. 
 Amazing story, gang. 
 Back to you in the studio. You see how my hair is messed up? I could've fixed it, but they wouldn't let me do another take. It's the news, Carmen. They're more focused on the crime than your hair. My hair is the crime. You know, let's watch the interview from Channel 9. Those people knew how to light me. [Cellphone rings] Oh, God. Who is it? That's my divorce lawyer. We're waiting for the judge to make a ruling on custody. This could be it. [Ringing continues] Oh, it just has to be good news. If Peri takes Tucker to Europe, I won't see him for months. You will never know unless you answer the phone. [Cellphone beeps] Hey, Jeff. What'd the judge say? Uh-huh. Uh... Yeah, well, thanks for letting me know. [Cellphone beeps] [Glass shatters] It's okay. Don't worry. I'll clean it. I got it. Would you just leave me alone for a bit? Nick. What? That is the third pain pill you've taken in the last hour. So? So, you have to be careful with those things. The doctors told me to stay ahead of the pain. You are already ahead of the pain. You are about to lap the pain. I'd argue with you, but I'm too happy. [Laughs] Okay, well, before you drift off to sleep, I have some good news. Opal left. She did? Yep. So when you get home, it'll just be the two of us. We can finally start our lives as Mr. and Mrs. Deering. Which one am I? Okay. No more pills for you. [Chuckles] I'll be right back. Uh, Mrs. Deering? Yes. I'm detective Figueroa. I think you ow detective Wolf. We wanted to talk to your husband about the car that ran him down. Hi. It's very nice to meet you, but I'm afraid now's not a good time. Well, we could come back, but so you know, time is of the essence with hit-and-runs. [Sighs] Let me see if he's up for it. Excuse me. Honey? Honey, the police are here. Do you think you could talk to them for a few minutes? [Sighs] They just have a few questions about the accident. They know about that? It's not exactly a secret. You have to believe me. I... I never meant for it to happen. It's okay. Nobody blames you. He was right in front of me. He? I didn't mean to kill him. What? I'm so sorry. Nick. Nick. [Marisol sighs] Like I said, he's just not up for it. Thank you. Yeah, we'll, uh, come back tomorrow. Thanks. Come on. There you go. [Grunts] Very good, Mr. Kenneth. See? I knew you could do it. Therapy is p-p-painful, but it's working. It sure is. Soon, you will be so strong, you can run your business again. There's n-n-no rush. Reggie has things under control. Yes. Mr. Reggie's taking wonderful care of the house. He's even talking about redecorating. Redecorating? He says he wants to sell that painting of yours. The big one in the living room. That's an original. He can't sell that. He can do whatever he wants. With your house, with your bank accounts... You gave him power of attorney. Of course, now that you're getting stronger, you can always take it back. [Sighs] Hey. How are you doing? Honestly? I'm not so good. But I am finding a way to ease the pain. I still can't believe Peri got custody of your son. Oh, I knew I was screwed when the judge asked for her autograph. Would you like something to eat? I'll take an olive, floating in a glass of vodka. Spence, you can't just sit here by yourself and drink all night. Then join me for some Martinis. What? You are right. Drinking alone is pathetic. You know, it's late. I have to do the dishes before going to bed. I'll tell you what. [Claps] I'll make a deal with you. You have a quick drink with me, you don't have to do those dishes. You know, dishes are easy. I just stick them in the machine. Well, what would you say to no vacuuming in the morning? I'd say you getting warmer. How about if I gave you the whole day off tomorrow? I'll get the olives. You pour. Party is on! [Sighs] [Gasps] Hello. Zoila! You scared me. I thought you were Sven. Sven? Does he work here? He's a lecherous masseur who touches me inappropriately. I'm gonna file a complaint. Someday. So, how's my mother? You're coming home... Now. She got to you, didn't she? That woman is... Toxic? Rude? Drunk? Yes, yes, and yes. I'm sorry she's such a nightmare. But I can't leave the spa. I need to stay here for my kidneys. You can't cure kidney disease with facials. Are you sure? Have there been studies? I tried the same lie with your mother. But she knows what you're up to, and she won't leave that house until you come home. No. No! I can't stand to be in the same room with her. You've been running away from your mother since you were 16. It's time you come home and deal with her. I want to stand up to her. I do. But every time I try to tell her how I feel, she attacks me, and I'm 5 years old again and helpless. Well, she won't attack you this time, because I'll be there to protect you. Really? Now, please... Come home. Okay. Give me five minutes to get ready. Hello, Genevieve. Oh [Chuckles] Sven. Make that 30 minutes. Look at me. I'm in a chair. Took me a half hour to get here, but I did it. Good. Hey, you don't sound impressed. Nick... When you were woozy on your meds, do you remember the conversation we had? No, why? You said something kind of... troubling. [Chuckling] Oh, boy, what'd I say? You told me that you killed someone, and then you said you were very sorry. [Chuckles] Ooh. Those are some kind of pills. Are they? Obviously. I mean, if they're getting me to make stuff up. It's just, when you said it, you sounded like you were... Confessing. You... you cannot possibly hold me accountable for what I say when I'm ripped on pain killers. Okay. Come on. Do you honestly think I would kill another human being? I said okay. You look cold. Let me get you a blanket. Hey, Uncle Ken. Got your message. What's up? I need you to sign this. What is it? My p-power of attorney. I want it back. Your financial affairs are very complex. Okay. You're not well enough to handle them. Maybe not, but you will sign it anyway. You seem angry. Okay, why is that? I've been looking at my accounts online. There's money missing. Look, of course there is. Okay, I-I've had to shift things around to pay for your medical bills, your utilities... Bull! I know what you're doing, and it's gonna stop. Do you know how paranoid you sound right now? I'd rather be p-p-paranoid than stupid. Look, if... if... If you will just give me a chance to explain... Give me my cane. I said, give me my cane. [Cellphone ringing] Hello? Hey, it's me. Marisol, why are you calling at this hour? It's 1:00 in the afternoon. Oh, s... Sorry, I'm a little hungover. On a Tuesday? Why are you being so loud? Can we meet for breakfast tomorrow? This thing happened with Nick, and I need someone to talk to about it. Sure. Yeah, we can meet. But I probably won't be eating ever again. I'll pick you up at 8:00. Bye. Spence! It's 1:00 in the afternoon. We have to get up and start our day. [Groans] Okay. Ugh. 
 
 Mr. Kenneth, I'm home. I got those pork chops you like. Hmm. Mr. Kenneth? Mr. Kenneth, I found your cane. Mr. Kenneth? Hey. Where is your Uncle? Afraid I have some bad news. Um... Uncle Ken had a fall. What? I think he was trying to walk up the stairs. But he's not strong enough for that. I know. So where is he now? Doheny Medical Center. Oh, my God. I got to go see him. Oh... oh, sorry. He... He's in real bad shape. Only family can see him. I am very close to Mr. Kenneth. But you're not family. Hello, mother. I'm back. Well, if it ain't the queen of the may. What happened? Did your spa run out of caviar? I have something I need to say to you, mother. Hopefully, once you hear this, we can finally establish some sort of relationship. [Scoffs] Oh, we have a relationship. I'm the mother who takes a bus across the country to come here, and you're the ungrateful daughter who doesn't give a moose fart. See? I've been here one minute, and she's already assaulting me with profanity. Just be strong. Mother... [Can pops] I was 7 years old when I found out that most mothers don't belittle their own children. For a long time, I thought there was something wrong with me, that I deserved your cruelty. But the truth is, you're just an unhappy woman, so filled with anger and bile, you lash out at anyone who gets too close. Oh, don't look so wounded. You know it's true. No, Genevieve, I... Let her finish this. Go ahead. I can forgive the past, mother. But only if I know our future is filled with kindness and mutual respect. If you can't be bothered to even pretend to love me, well, you can just go to hell. [Sighs] I can't believe it. I finally stood up to her. I am so proud of you. Thank you for standing by me. I couldn't have talked to my mother like that without you. You did good. [Thuds] Thank God you're back. How's your mother doing? [Sobs] Oh, my God. Is she dead? [Crying] No! What? [Sniffles] It was coronary angina. Some minor problem with her heart. I tried to tell the doctors she doesn't have one, but they wouldn't listen. Honey, I don't think you should joke about this. I know. [Sniffles] It's awful. But I can't help it. I was ready for her to die. Genevieve! I wish you could have heard her attack me in E.R., the horrible things she said. And then it hit me... She's never gonna be nice to me. Well, probably not. If she had died, maybe I could have held on to the last shred of love I feel for her. But she will keep on torturing me, and I will end up as angry and hate-filled as she is. Even so, you can't give up on her. She's your mother. Not really. You're more of a mother to me than she is. You do realize you're older than me, right? What is a mother, anyway? It's someone who cares about you and teaches you how to behave and makes you feel safe. All right. If you really think of me as your mother... And I'm not sure how I feel about that. But if you mean that... I do. Then you'll obey me when I tell you to do something, right? Uh... You are going to stick by your mother. And when she's difficult and insults you, you're gonna let those comments slide right off. You make it sound so easy. It won't be. But you're gonna take the high road, and you're gonna give that woman the respect and dignity she refuses to give you. Why would I do that? Because... and I'm getting more comfortable with this... That's how I raised you. Eres un ladron! ¿Me oyes? Deberias estar en la carcel! Ah! What's wrong? This guy wants $2,000 to fix the transmission on my car, and he refused to negotiate. I'm sorry you're having a bad day, but I got something to cheer you up. Thanks, but I don't think so. Uh, come on! Uh... you won't have to do laundry for the rest of the week. No. I'm done drinking for a while. Carmen? Uh... Please. I just need someone to talk to. We can talk without drinking. Yeah, but drinking's what makes it fun. Spence. I'll pay for your transmission. Seriously? Yeah, we're friends. Friends help each other out. Well... Maybe just one drink. Great. Now, when I squeeze your shoulder, that's when you say the magic word, okay? Okay. It's over here. Can I help you? We're looking for Kenneth Miller. Miller, let's see. Oh, I'm sorry, it says here that only family is permitted to see him. That's okay. We are family. Really? I'm his daughter-in-law, Rosie, and this is his grandson, Miguel. Uh... You are not on the list. Well, that's weird. Well, I just wanted to bring him this drawing from his grandson. But if you're not on the list... Please? Oh... So, what did you draw? Unicorns? Please? He worked so hard on this. Well, I suppose I can let you in for a second, but your son's going to have to stay here. That's okay. I trust you. Down the hall to your right. Room 210. Santo Dios. Excuse me... Why does he have all those tubes? He just fell. He was pretty agitated when he came in, poor guy. What do you mean? He was arguing with the man who brought him in. I think it was his nephew. We had to sedate him just to calm him down. Whose idea was that? His nephew's? As a matter of fact, yeah. I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Kenneth. And I don't know how, but I'm going to get you out of here. [Sniffles] Look, it's right there in the second paragraph. "A witness says one of the robbers was stabbed with a knife before he got away." Oh, my God. The police think it's the same gang who killed Alejandro Rubio. That's why I ran two red lights getting over here. Where is Ethan? He's sleeping. Well, wake him up! Wait! It's not possible. Ethan couldn't kill someone. You sure about that? 'Cause if he was involved and the police find out, well, he's not the only one who will be arrested here. What do you mean? I mean you drove him here, I stitched him up. That makes us accomplices after the fact. But we're not sure he did this. That's why you need to wake up your boyfriend and get him to tell you the truth. What if he won't? Well, then, you'll know he doesn't really love you, and then you can stop protecting him. This is gonna end badly for Ethan, huh? That's why you've got to be smart and do the right thing... So it doesn't end badly for you. [Knock on door] Carmen? Carmen? We were supposed to have breakfast today. Did you forget? [Carmen groans] Oh, my God. Are you okay? You know what happens to people that break into my house? I stab them. Like this! This! Oh, yes, you're very dangerous. Okay, time to get up. Oh, there we go. Ooh. Ay, why do you make me stand up? Now I can feel the hangover. And I can smell your breath, so we're even. Ugh... Sort of. Carmen! Have you seen my pants? Oh, lord. They're in the dryer. Remember? You threw up on them. Oh, yeah. Hey! You're Rosie's friend. And you're half naked. Well, would you look at that? What exactly happened here last night? Relax, okay? We didn't sleep together. Are you sure? Just because I had a few drinks doesn't mean that I'm gonna stop acting like a lady. Carmen. [Whines] You need to understand what this looks like... A live-in maid getting drunk with her employer? Spence is having a rough time. He needed somebody to talk to. So we had a few, and we discussed our lives, and that's it. Well, I believe you. But what would Rosie think if she knew about this? Oh, that's a good point. Okay. I won't drink with Spence anymore. But we had the most amazing conversation. How amazing could it have been when you're both three sheets to the wind? You'd be surprised. One the liquor is poured, the walls come down and the secrets come out. Carmen, do you think the same thing happens with pain pills? Sure. We all want to tell the truth. Some of us just need a crutch. Hello?! Anybody?! [Bell rings] What are you doing? I'm not a potted plant. You can't just stick me in the corner and forget about me. We didn't forget about you. Zoila was just helping me pack for our trip back to Oklahoma. Crap in heaven, what are you wearing? Dolce and Gabbana. I'm just trying to look stylish for my mother. Oh, you're just trying to show off. Been like that since she was 3. Wasn't cute then, either. If you want me to change, I will. Why are you being so nice? She's being a good daughter. And you should get going. You don't want to miss your plane. Well, don't just stand there looking ethnic. Push me. I'll let Genevieve push you. It'll be safer for you. Hey, you want your bell back? Keep it. As a souvenir. Oh, my bags are packed. I don't know where I'd put it. I have an idea. Here we go. Careful. Yes, mother. You never did know how to drive. I remember when you were 16, you dented the Fender of my Pontiac. $46 I'll never see again. I told you not to take the car out. Well? It's a long story. You might want to take a seat. We were just four stupid teenagers bitching about life and how unfair it is, and then we had this idea to steal from the rich and give to the poor. It sounded so simple. No one was supposed to get hurt. How could you be that stupid? I don't know. Val, I am so sorry. I can forgive you... If you take responsibility. What do you mean? You want me to turn myself in? If you did, they might go easy on you. No. Alejandro is dead. If the police find out I was involved, my life is over. They're gonna catch you. It's only a matter of time. Then let's run away. Huh? To Tahiti or... or... Or South America. We can build a whole new life. I like my life just as it is. I feel awful about what I did. I do. But... I can't go to prison. If you love me, you'll find a way to do the right thing. Valentina, w-what are you doing? I'm going. But I won't tell the police what you've done. Valentina, come on. I don't have a choice here. You've always had choices. You just keep making the wrong ones. [Door closes] [Sobs] [Tires squeal] [Siren wailing] Oh, for God's sake. [Wailing stops] License and registration. Okay. Miss, do you know why I pulled you over? Your vehicle was swerving. Sorry about that. I was crying, so I reached for a tissue. Rough night, huh? Yeah. What's that on your back seat? Oh, uh... [Sighs] Nothing. Is that blood? Mm. You're back from the grocery store. Did you get us some Tequila? [Sighs] No. I thought we were doing shots tonight. Thanks, but I'm on the wagon. So, we're not gonna have a little party? I think the party's over. For both of us. I had a bad week. I'm allowed to dull the pain. Every night, Spence? Till you pass out? She took my kid. Drinking won't get him back. I will stay up late, I will talk to you, I will hold your hand. But I won't help you become a drunk. Okay. Don't buy any more liquor. Really? I'll get my act together. I promise. Okay. [Sighs] Hey. Where were you this afternoon? Um... Miguel had a playdate. Oh. Well, I have been anxious for you to get back. I have a little gift for you. What is it? Open it and find out. Oh, my God. Do you like it? This looks expensive. It was. But where would you get the money for something like this? It's a gift, Rosie. You really should just say thank you. It's too much. I can't take it. Of course you can. You're my girl. You got to let me spoil you a little bit. It would not be right. Rosie, just try it on. All right. Beautiful. How was your walk? Slow. I got it from here. Just be careful. I'll be back in a little while with his lunch. Thank you. Still in pain? Oh, yeah. Why don't you take a pill? Huh? It's been a while since you had one. Thought you didn't want me to get addicted? Well, I don't want you to suffer, either. No, I'm... I'm good. Okay. Have it your way. I'm gonna get a cup of coffee. I'll be right back. Hey. Thought you might like some juice. Thanks. You didn't put a little something in here, did you? What are you talking about? You know, I-I-I, uh... I'm not really thirsty. Fine. That's absolutely fine. Careful. See? You're in pain. Have a pill. No. Well, then have some juice. Stop trying to drug me! Afraid you might make another confession? That's ridiculous. I always wondered, "why did you let Opal stay in your house?" Now I get it. She was blackmailing you. You know, ii-I-I'm not feeling well. Who did you kill, Nick? Whatever you've done, I will try to understand. But you have got to tell me the truth. I'm not a murderer. When you get home, I won't be there. No, no. No, don't do that. Marisol... Please! Marisol please... Marisol!
