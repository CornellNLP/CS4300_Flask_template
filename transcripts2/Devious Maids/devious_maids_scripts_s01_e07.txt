 Previously, on 
 Devious Maids... 
 Mr. Spence?! 
 What in God's name happened? 
 Mr. Spence had a heart attack. 
 About your trust fund... 
 It's gone, too? 
 You always could party with the best of them. 
 I haven't done that in a while. 
 You owe me. 
 Valentina : You're taking this really well. 
 (Sniffs) No, no, I'm good. 
 I'm... I'm great, actually. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Julie. 
 I work next door for the Higgins. 
 Are you jealous? 
 I am jealous. 
 Evelyn : Marisol had a nasty little shock today. 
 I believe she happened upon one of your nauseating DVDs. 
 This could be devastating if any of these got out. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Michael! 
 (Smack) 
 (Clinks and shatters) 
 You listen to me, you pervert. 
 I am not leaving here without those DVDs! 
 I'm going to give them what they came for... and then we're gonna put this nasty little mess behind us. 
 Oh, and, Marisol... 
 You're fired. 
 You lied to our faces. 
 Pretending to be a maid. 
 Pretending to be our friend! 
 You were close to Flora. 
 And I needed to know the truth about her. 
 So you admit you were just using us? 
 I am trying to get my son out jail! 
 Well, you can stop pretending, 'cause I am telling everyone who you really are! 
 I don't think so. 
 You just watch me. 
 Well, then I guess I'm gonna have to tell Peri Westmore that you're sleeping with her husband. 
 (Voice trembles) What? 
 Yeah. 
 I know about Spence. 
 So here is the deal. 
 You don't tell my secret, and I won't tell yours. 
 I... hate you! 
 (Door opens and closes) 
 I can live with that. 
 Zoila : Guys? 
 What the hell is going on? 
 1x07 
Taking a Message 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 I've come to apologize. 
 Really? 
 I feel so badly... about what happened the other night. 
 I had no idea Mr. Stappord would attack your husband. 
 Is that all? 
 I also... wanted to tell you that I've grown fond of you and Mr. Powell. 
 And if you could find it in your heart to forgive me, I would love to come back and work for you. 
 Good help does more than fold shirts and wash dishes. 
 The people who work for us must also keep our secrets. 
 And since  you  are incapable of doing that, I'm sure you will understand why we will never allow you in this house again. 
 (Exhales deeply) 
 (Woman speaking Spanish indistinctly) 
 Rosie : Shh! Shh! 
 Marisol! Come here. Sit. 
 Take off your load. 
 She meant to say... 
 (Chuckles) I got it. 
 Thank you. 
 So how are you guys? 
 We're good. How are you? 
 I'm fine. Why? 
 We heard the Powells fired you. 
 News travels fast. 
 Especially on the L.P.L. 
 (Mouths words) 
 The Latina Pipeline. 
 Oh. 
 (Laughs) 
 We also heard Michael Stappord got into a fistfight with Mr. Powell. 
 You don't have to gossip if you don't feel like it. 
 But when you do... we are so here for you. 
 There was some drama, yes. 
 And you're okay? 
 Oh, I'm fine. 
 Mm, good. 
 (Envelope rustling) 
 What is this? 
 It's from all of us. 
 I don't understand. 
 It was obvious you took that job with the Powells because you needed the extra money. 
 (Envelope rustles) So... until you find another job... 
 Which won't be long because we hear about every job that opens up. 
 God bless the L.P.L. 
 (Sighs deeply) 
 I can't believe you guys did this. 
 Well, what's the big surprise? 
 You're our friend. 
 And that means we've got your back. 
 Did I say that right? 
 You did. 
 Absolutely. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Chuckles) 
 Remi? 
 Hey, you. 
 What are you doing up so early? 
 It's, uh, 9:00 in the morning. 
 Is it? Wow. Must have lost track of time. 
 You spilled something on your jacket. 
 Oh. I'm not surprised. 
 Me and some buddies went to this club last night. 
 It was insane! 
 I wish you could have gone. 
 I wish you would have asked me to go. 
 All right. Well, let me make it up to you. 
 What are you doing? 
 May I have this dance? 
 (Scoffs) How much did you have to drink? 
 Not one drop. Come on. 
 Dance with me. 
 Remi, this is silly. 
 Why? 
 For starters, there's no music. 
 Then I'll sing. 
 (Humming) 
 You know what's crazy? 
 All the people that never dance. 
 I mean, the world is full of music, and they can't hear it... which is sad because life is short. 
 And we have to dance while we can. 
 What's wrong with your eyes? 
 What? 
 Your pupils are tiny. 
 Oh. Uh... it's... it's... it's nothing. 
 I'm just tired. 
 I'm actually gonna go to bed. 
 You want me to clean your jacket? 
 Uh, just get it later. 
 I'm gonna go conk out. 
 Thanks for the dance. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 (Cell phone alert chimes) 
 (Buttons clicking) 
 (Cell phone alert chimes) 
 I felt awful, Ida. 
 These women don't make that much. 
 What did they have to sacrifice to scrape that money together? 
 Well, once we get Eddie out of jail, you can come back and write them all a check. 
 It's not just that. 
 They really... care about me. 
 And I'm starting to feel like I'm using them. 
 You can't think about that right now. 
 Eyes on the prize. 
 I mean, we're getting so close. 
 (Sighs) That's what I keep telling myself. 
 I'm about to meet Rosie. 
 We'll talk later? 
 Sure. 
 Okay. Bye. (Cell phone beeps) 
 (Cell phone alert chimes) 
 (Buttons clicking) 
 Hey, you! 
 (Gasps) 
 Sorry. I'll get that for you. 
 No, no! 
 I'll get it. 
 I needed one of these anyway. 
 You need an African horned melon? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm making, um... flan. 
 So... after we're done shopping, you want to have lunch? 
 My treat. 
 I can afford my own lunch, Rosie. 
 But sure. That'd be... 
 That'd be nice. 
 Professor Suarez? 
 I should stop by the deli counter. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 I knew that was you. 
 Do I know you? 
 Professor Suarez, it's me... 
 Melissa Morgan. 
 I had you for English lit. 
 Professor? 
 "We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars." 
 Oscar Wilde. You were the reason I fell in love with him. 
 I read your book twice. 
 I'm sorry, but I'm not who you think I am. 
 Wow. Okay. 
 You just really look like her. 
 Excuse me. 
 Well... that was weird. 
 Yeah. 
 I guess I just have one of those faces. 
 Hey, let's hurry up so we can to go lunch. 
 I'm starving! 
 (Inhales deeply and sighs) 
 (Moans) Whatcha doing? 
 Watching you sleep. 
 That's sort of creepy. 
 (Chuckles) Can't help myself, 'cause most women are not this beautiful in the morning. 
 Mm. 
 Morning? 
 I spent the night? 
 (Chuckles) Hey, it's no big deal. 
 It is a very big deal. 
 We had an amazing time. 
 Why are you freaking out? 
 We're friends with benefits. 
 Staying overnight is against the rules. 
 It leads to... emotions and... and other bad stuff. 
 Wait. You don't think last night was emotional? 
 After we made love, I seem to recall someone shedding a few tears. 
 Yeah. You gotta stop that. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Look, make all the jokes you want. 
 This is more than friends with benefits. 
 (Zips dress) No. It's not. 
 It is for me, Carmen. 
 Look, I can really see myself falling in love with you. 
 Aw. 
 Ow! 
 Words like "love" and "forever" make me crazy. 
 I'm not ready to go there yet. 
 And if you keep it up, I swear to God, I'm going to run for the exit. 
 All right, look. 
 You want to take it slow? 
 I get it. 
 But I gotta feel like I'm more than just a buddy, especially after last night. 
 Okay. 
 You can be my boyfriend. 
 Yes! 
 Don't get excited. It's annoying. 
 Uh, sorry. 
 But I'm very pleased with this turn of events. 
 (Chuckles) And just know we're gonna be so good together. 
 (Gasps) I can't wait for you to meet my mama. 
 She's gonna lo... (Grunts) 
 (Slaps) 
 (Sighs) Yeah, I deserved that one. 
 (Wheels clacking) 
 Evelyn : Here she is. 
 The tray looks absolutely lovely. 
 Thank you, Dong Mei. 
 This is your new maid? 
 Isn't she precious? 
 Like a vase from the Ming dynasty. 
 The years have cracked the surface, but the fragile beauty still remains. 
 (Clattering) Oh, watch the tray, darling. 
 Don't want to spill. 
 (Speaks Chinese dialect) (Tray clatters) 
 Her English is limited. 
 I've had to learn Cantonese to bridge the gap. 
 Cantonese? 
 (Saucers clattering) Just a few useful phrases. 
 Like, "Get the mop," 
 "Wipe that up," 
 "Put your teeth in." 
 Things like that. 
 (Clattering) 
 Isn't she a bit old? 
 See, now I think that's wonderful. 
 How many people can say they have a maid who was there when they invented the won ton? 
 That is impressive. 
 But surely the agency had more suitable choices. 
 They won't send me anyone... because of what happened to Flora. 
 (Clattering) 
 (Rattling) 
 Careful, sweetness. 
 Here, look at... 
 Look at the cup. 
 Look... Okay, just give... 
 Just give me the pot. 
 (Speaks Cantonese) Dong Mei. 
 Why don't you get us some of your delicious almond cookies? All right? 
 Why not ask Marisol to come back? 
 (Pot clatters, liquid pours) Marisol betrayed us. 
 She's the reason Adrian is having reconstructive surgery as we speak. 
 She had no way of knowing Michael would react so violently. 
 (Liquid pouring, plates clacking) 
 And if Adrian hadn't made those videos... 
 I told you that in strictest confidence. 
 I'm not judging. 
 I'm trying to help. 
 When I think of the hands life keeps dealing you... the loss of your son, Adrian's deviancy, and then to have your maid murdered in this very room... 
 (Dishes crash) Your maid murdered? 
 Well... 
 (Chuckles) 
 That happened a long time ago. 
 Wait, why are you taking off your apron? 
 I no work in murder house! 
 No, let's talk about this. 
 No need to be childish! (Cup clatters) 
 (Shouting in Cantonese) 
 Yes, I had a maid who was murdered, but that means the odds of you being killed are practically nil. 
 Even after she said, "You've mistaken me for someone else," this girl was sure that Marisol was Professor Suarez. 
 Don't you think that's strange? 
 Not really. 
 People stop me all the time and ask if I'm Penelope Cruz. 
 That happened once over two years ago. 
 Let it go. 
 This man was so convinced, he made me sign an autograph. 
 But he became suspicious when she misspelled "Penelope." 
 Zoila. 
 Guys... 
 I'm asking a serious question here. 
 What if Marisol isn't who she says she is? 
 Come on. Why would a Professor pretend to be a maid? 
 Maybe she's hiding something. 
 Maybe you're paranoid. 
 Hey. 
 You're the one who said Marisol was asking too many questions about Flora, remember? 
 That's when she first came here. 
 But now that I know her, I trust her. 
 Yeah. 
 But she never talks about her life or what she did before she came here. 
 Don't you think that's weird? 
 I don't tell you guys everything about my life. 
 And I've had some crazy stuff happen to me. (Chuckles) 
 Did someone once mistake you for Jennifer Lopez? 
 You resent my beauty. 
 Just admit it. 
 (Sugar packet rustles) 
 (Chuckles) 
 I don't know. 
 I think Marisol has some kind of secret. 
 So what if she does? 
 Marisol is our friend. 
 When she is ready to tell us what her secret is, we will be there for her. 
 Okay? 
 Can I have some sugar, Beyoncé? 
 I never liked you. 
 I hope you know that. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Laughs) 
 (Knock on door) 
 (Buckle clacks) 
 (Footsteps approach) 
 I'm off to the dry cleaners. 
 Anything else? 
 Yes. Here's Remi's jacket. 
 God, what did he do last night? 
 This smells awful. 
 You should smell the clothes in his duffel bag. 
 Have those not been washed since he came home from college? 
 I don't think they've been washed since he was in junior high. 
 (Washing machine door closes) I don't get it. 
 The boy's smart enough to get into medical school, but he can't figure out how to operate a washing machine? 
 He left some detergent in here, so at least he was planning on doing some laundry. 
 Zoila : What a prince. 
 (Sighs) 
 Hey! Have you seen my duffel bag? 
 I-it's over there. 
 This... this is empty. 
 W-why is this empty? 
 I took out the dirty clothes to wash them. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. Nothing. Um... 
 I-I-I'm just curious. 
 When you took out the clothes, did you happen to see a little plastic baggie in here? 
 You mean the one with the detergent? 
 Huh? 
 The detergent. 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
 That's... that's... that's what I mean. 
 What did you do with the, uh, detergent? 
 I used it. 
 What? 
 I used it to wash your dirty clothes. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no. 
 (Whirring) No! 
 Remi, what is going on? 
 The stuff in that bag cost me $6,000. (Sighs) 
 Have you considered using tide? 
 It's a lot cheaper. 
 It wasn't detergent, Valentina. 
 It was cocaine. 
 Cocaine? 
 I've been a little stressed out lately, all right? 
 With my mom's financial problems and school... 
 What's going on at school? 
 I'm failing all my classes. 
 Oh. 
 Look... (Sniffs) 
 I just needed a little bit to help me get through the day. That's all. 
 Are you doing anything else? 
 Like what? 
 I don't know. 
 Am I gonna find ecstasy in your bedroom? 
 Well, if you did, you'd probably use it as fabric softener. 
 Remi, it's not funny. 
 (Sighs) 
 I've just been doing coke, that's all. 
 Okay. 
 Listen to me. 
 You cannot tell anyone about this, all right? 
 My mom will freak, and she's already been through so much. 
 You're putting me in a horrible position. 
 I'm broke. (Chuckles) I'm broke. 
 I can't even afford to do anything else. 
 All right? Now come on. 
 If you care about me at all, you'll promise. 
 Okay. I promise. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 (Sniffs) 
 (Chuckles) 
 Girlfriend? 
 Yes, boyfriend? 
 Why do you buy steaks here? 
 The butcher is a fan of mine, so she gives me a discount. 
 Hmm. I've never heard of a lady butcher. 
 Well, Bertha isn't like other people. 
 She's a little... odd. 
 Odd? 
 How is she... odd? 
 (Doors open) 
 Hey, superstar! 
 Give me a hug! 
 I'd love to, Bertha. 
 But... (Voice screeches) 
 Oh, sorry. Sometimes I forget how disgusting I am. 
 (Sam and Carmen laugh) Uhh! 
 Oh! How you doing? 
 (Moans) Mm, good. 
 Did you get some nice steaks for me today? 
 Ooh, you know I do. 
 Henry! Grab those steaks that I put inside for Miss Carmen. 
 And get my pill case. 
 Forgot to take my meds today. (Chuckles) 
 Bertha... I want you to meet someone. 
 This isn't the boyfriend, is it? 
 It sure is. 
 Oh, it's an absolute pleasure. 
 Miss Carmen talks about you all the time. 
 And her eyes just light up. 
 Do they really? 
 Remember, she forgot to take her meds. 
 Okay. 
 (Chuckles) 
 So, uh, how did you two meet? 
 Well, uh, Carmen is a maid for Alejandro Rubio, and I'm sort of his butler. 
 Oh, I bet you are. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Okay. Calm down, Bertha. 
 Now I know that Miss Carmen is going to be a famous singer. 
 How about you? What are you going to be when you grow up? 
 Actually, I'm happy doing what I do. 
 Good for you, Sam. 
 So many people hate their jobs. 
 Not me. 
 Good hours, nice place to live. 
 I wouldn't mind being a butler for the rest of my life. 
 I like you, Sam. 
 Would you like free meat? 
 I've got a t-bone over here I've been saving for someone special. 
 Come on. 
 All right. (Chuckles) 
 (Sniffling) 
 (Door closes, footsteps approach) 
 (Gasps) Olivia! 
 Thank God you're here. 
 What on earth is wrong? 
 I couldn't understand your voicemail. 
 You were so hysterical. 
 I'm at my wit's end. I really am. 
 Just calm down. 
 Tell me what's happened. 
 (Breathing heavily) Oh, Olivia. 
 (Exhales sharply) It's my vacuum cleaner. 
 Your vacuum cleaner? 
 (Sniffles) 
 It doesn't work. 
 And it should, because it's brand-new. 
 You called me over here to fix your vacuum? 
 For God sake, Evelyn! 
 I thought someone had attacked you. 
 Please don't yell at me. 
 I left a meeting with my therapist for you. 
 And I appreciate it. 
 Well, I don't. 
 Next time, call someone else. 
 Who should I call? 
 My friends don't really care about me. 
 (Sobbing) My husband wants nothing to do with me. 
 (Sobbing continues) 
 I don't have a child. 
 (Sniffling) 
 (Sighs) 
 You know what my problem is? 
 I'm all alone in this big house, and I've got too much time to think about my life. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Well, I know what that's like. 
 (Sighs) 
 Here's what we're gonna do. 
 What? 
 (Sniffling) 
 We will find you a maid. 
 (Chuckles) Someone who will take wonderful care of you and make your life better. 
 It's ironic. 
 What is? 
 My life sucks... but my vacuum doesn't. 
 (Both chuckle) 
 (Sniffles) 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Since when do you cry over nothing? 
 (Sighs) I've just been worried about, um, a friend who has gotten himself into some trouble. 
 And you can't help him? 
 (Voice breaking) I want to, but I don't know how. 
 I bet I'd know. 
 He made me promise not to tell. 
 Now why would Remi make you promise that? 
 How did you know it's Remi? 
 You're in his room. 
 You're looking at his picture. 
 Behold, my psychic power. 
 Mami, I can't talk about this. 
 He'd be so angry with me. 
 Don't you care about him? 
 Of course! I love him. 
 Then do what's best for him and not what's comfortable for you. 
 Remi is using drugs. 
 Cocaine? 
 How did you know? 
 It's not the first time. 
 Really? 
 Remember when he was in high school? 
 He went to London to study for the summer? 
 He was actually in rehab. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 You were 12. 
 I wasn't gonna discuss addiction with somebody who was still playing with dolls. 
 So Mrs. Delatour knew? 
 Yeah. 
 She fell apart. 
 She didn't know how to help him. 
 (Crying) 
 I don't know how to help him either. 
 It's okay, baby... because I do. 
 Come here. 
 (Keys clacking) 
 (Cell phone alert chimes) 
 (Beep) 
 (Buttons clicking) 
 (Cell phone whooshes, clatters) 
 (Cell phone alert chimes) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Buttons clicking) 
 (Cell phone whooshes) 
 (Typing) 
 (Typing continues) 
 (Keys clack) 
 Hey, Rosie. 
 What's going on? 
 I need to show you something. 
 That woman at the store was right. 
 You are an English Professor. 
 I can explain. 
 Can you? 
 Most maids learn English. 
 They don't teach it. 
 The university made budget cuts. 
 I lost my job, and I needed money. 
 So you thought, "Why not clean houses for a living?" 
 It's Beverly Hills. 
 (Papers rustle) 
 The pay is surprisingly good. 
 So why did you never say anything? 
 I was embarrassed. 
 See... 
 I think you're lying. 
 That is not a nice thing to say. 
 I don't like saying it. 
 We are friends, Marisol. 
 If you're in trouble, I'll help you. 
 But I need to know the truth. 
 (Sighs) Okay. 
 You're right. 
 I did have a secret reason for taking this job. 
 What was it? 
 I'm trying to find out who killed Flora Hernandez. 
 Why? 
 They already arrested that boy. 
 Do you not think he did it? 
 No! No! You see, he loved her. 
 He would never have hurt her. 
 You know that boy? 
 He's my son. 
 Dios Santo. 
 Since I've been here, I've been collecting evidence. 
 And I've learned things about Flora. 
 Yeah, things we told you! 
 She was not who she seemed to be! 
 Well, that's funny... Coming from you. 
 Please understand. 
 I am trying to save my son's life! 
 Let go of me. 
 Rosie, we're friends. 
 You said you would help me. 
 I don't want to help a murderer. 
 And we are not friends. 
 Not anymore. 
 (Door opens and closes) 
 (Line rings) 
 (Ring, click) 
 Woman : You've reached the office of Ida Hayes, attorney-at-law. 
 Please leave a message. (Beep) 
 Ida, it's Marisol. 
 Rosie knows about Eddie. 
 I think she's gonna tell the girls... 
 (Cell phone alert chimes) 
 Um... I don't know what to do. 
 Can you call me as soon as you can? 
 Thanks. 
 (Cell phone alert chimes) 
 (Chimes) 
 (Beep) 
 (Sam grunts) Do you need help? 
 (Strained voice) Nope. Nope. 
 Chivalry is not dead, just a little out of shape. 
 Sam, can I ask you something? 
 (Grunts) 
 When we were at the store talking to Bertha, were you joking? 
 (Normal voice) About what? 
 Being a butler. 
 I mean, you really think this is the perfect job for you? 
 Sure. 
 But you're so smart and talented. 
 You could be anything you want to be. 
 As it turns out, I want to be a butler. 
 (Chuckles) 
 I don't understand that. 
 Why not? 
 I don't know. 
 I just thought you were... ambitious... like me. 
 (Chuckles) Here's a news flash, Carmen. 
 Not everyone is like you. 
 Well, they should be. 
 Really? 
 Everyone should want to be a star? 
 Everyone should want to accomplish as much as they can in life before it's too late. 
 You know what I want to accomplish? 
 Happiness. 
 Okay. So you're happy fixing someone else's drain? 
 You're happy waxing someone else's Bentley? 
 As a matter of fact, I am. 
 Really? 
 How about when you're 80... living in a rat-infested apartment? 
 Is that gonna make you happy? 
 Hmm? When you can't even afford to pay the rent? 
 I feel if I save my money and invest wisely, I'll always be able to afford a rat-infested apartment. 
 You know what, I don't want to fight anymore. 
 Just put away the groceries. 
 Carmen! 
 It's menial labor. 
 I'm sure it's gonna make you orgasm with happiness. 
 Since when are you such a snob about money? 
 This isn't about money. 
 It's about ambition. 
 You should want to do something amazing with your life. 
 Why are you being this way? 
 Look, I've been a butler since you met me. 
 What's changed? 
 You're my... boyfriend now. 
 So? 
 So I'm starting to... to feel... things for you. 
 Deep things. 
 But that's great. 
 I mean, why does that make you sad? 
 Because... we can't have a future together if you're happy treading water. 
 Why does it matter what I do for a living? 
 Sam... I know me. 
 And I'm never gonna marry a butler. 
 (Door handle clacks) 
 Can I come in? 
 There's some things I need to tell you. 
 Why bother? 
 I won't believe a word you say. 
 Two minutes. 
 That's all I ask. 
 (Door closes) 
 What is that? 
 It's the money you and the girls gave me. 
 I guess a college Professor doesn't need a loan. 
 Some might. 
 But I don't. 
 Did it make you laugh? 
 Watching us trying to help you? 
 Not at all. 
 I was incredibly touched. 
 You lied to our faces. 
 Pretending to be a maid. 
 Pretending to be our friend. 
 You were close to Flora, and I needed to know the truth about her. 
 So you admit you were just using us? 
 I am trying to get my son out of jail! 
 What the heck is going on? 
 I got this weird phone call from Rosie. 
 It's something about Marisol. 
 She said she needed us here immediately. 
 She sounded hysterical. 
 Well, you can stop pretending 'cause I am telling everyone who you really are! 
 I don't think so. 
 You just watch me. 
 Well, then I guess I'm gonna have to tell Peri Westmore that you're sleeping with her husband. 
 (Voice breaking) What? 
 Yeah. I know about Spence. 
 How? 
 So here's the deal. 
 You don't tell my secret. 
 I won't tell yours. 
 I... hate you! 
 (Door closes) I can live with that. 
 Zoila : Guys? 
 What the hell is going on? 
 We're just having a little... disagreement. 
 About what? 
 Marisol doesn't want our money. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Yeah. She said she doesn't need it. 
 And Rosie was somewhat insulted. 
 Well... 
 That's nothing to fight over. 
 If she doesn't need it, she doesn't need it. 
 I hope you weren't offended. 
 No. Not at all. 
 It made me realize how important your friendship is to me. 
 I gotta get back to work. 
 Well, maybe we can all meet up for lunch tomorrow? 
 Sounds great. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm busy tomorrow. 
 Maybe some other time. 
 She'll be fine. Let's go. 
 (Sighs) 
 Zoila, have you seen my car keys? 
 Are you going somewhere? 
 A friend's having a party. 
 I thought I'd stop by. 
 Okay. 
 So... car keys? 
 They're in the kitchen. 
 Before you go... 
 Can I talk to you for a second? 
 I guess. 
 What's on your mind? 
 Do you remember the day you learned how to ride a bike? 
 No. 
 I do. 
 (Chuckles) Your mother tried to teach you, but you kept falling. 
 And your mother became so frustrated, she started to cry. 
 (Chuckles) 
 You finally told her not to worry. 
 She could go inside, and you could learn to ride the bike all by yourself. 
 (Chuckles) You were so cute. 
 How old was I? 
 You were 6. 
 It's the story of your life... 
 You taking care of your mother when she should have been taking care of you. 
 Well, she does the best she can. 
 But it's not right. 
 When children fall, they need to know someone will be there to pick them up. 
 Why are we talking about this? 
 I've watched you your whole life. 
 Trying so hard to be the perfect son because you know how much your mother depends upon you. 
 But who do you depend upon? 
 Who do you turn to when you're stressed out about school or money... or relationships? 
 Valentina told you, didn't she? 
 And I'm telling you that it's okay for you to fall because those of us who love you will be there to pick you up again. 
 (Sighs) 
 Where are my car keys? 
 You're not going to that party. 
 My personal life is none of your business. 
 (Vehicle approaches) 
 You're the housekeeper. 
 You can't tell me what to do. 
 (Vehicle door closes) It's true. 
 I can't make you do anything. 
 That's why I've been waiting for the one person who can. 
 (Door opens) 
 (Door closes) 
 Dad? 
 Where's his suitcase? 
 It's right there. 
 What's going on? 
 You're going back to rehab. 
 What?! No! Dad, come on! 
 Sorry, son. 
 I have finals coming up. 
 College will still be here when you get back. 
 I am not out of control this time. 
 I swear. 
 You have to believe me. 
 Please. 
 Don't do this to me. 
 We're not doing this to you. 
 We're doing it for you. 
 Let's go, son. 
 (Door closes) 
 (Switch clicks) 
 I need to tell you about my dad. 
 (Sighs) Sam, it's 1:00 in the morning. 
 He worked at this insurance firm for 30 years, and he hated it, but he did it to support his family. 
 And then he had a heart attack. 
 And he died. 
 I don't think he ever really enjoyed his life. 
 Uh, why are you telling me this? 
 Because I think I've been using it as an excuse not to push myself. 
 I'm capable of more, but it has to be something that makes me happy. 
 That's great. 
 Okay, c-can we maybe talk about this in the morning? 
 I won't be here in the morning. 
 I just quit. 
 I'm leaving tonight. 
 What? 
 I-I've given this a lot of thought. 
 And I'm going to be somebody you want to spend your life with. 
 You can't just quit. 
 Th-that's crazy. 
 It's not. 
 You were right... about all of it. 
 I can be more. 
 I can do more. 
 You're only wrong about one thing. 
 (Chuckles) I as am ambitious as any man who's ever lived. 
 But my real ambition... is you. 
 (Voice breaking) Sam, please. Don't do this. 
 It's okay. I'll be back. 
 (Knock on door) 
 Buen día, Raul. 
 (Speaking Spanish) 
 (Envelope rustles) 
 Can I show you something? 
 Uh... sure. 
 My son sent me this. 
 Oh, really? 
 (Chuckles) 
 Miguel drew this? 
 This is what he thinks he will look like when he comes to America. 
 (Chuckles) 
 That's him getting off the plane, and that is me waiting for him. (Chuckles) 
 It's so sweet. 
 When I saw this, it made me think about my son. 
 He's so kind and sweet. 
 If someone said he had done something wrong, I would not believe them. 
 And I would do everything I could to protect him. 
 Just like you are doing for your son. 
 Oh, Rosie. I am... 
 I am so sorry. 
 You don't have to apologize. 
 I understand why you're here. 
 It's torn me up inside not to be honest with all of you, really. 
 But no more. 
 I'm going to tell Carmen and Zoila today. 
 No. You keep your secret. 
 It's safer. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 But it's good I know the truth, because now I can help you. 
 You would do that for me? 
 Of course. 
 You're my friend. 
 Now tell me, what can I do? Hmm? 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Hello. 
 I heard you were looking for a new maid?
