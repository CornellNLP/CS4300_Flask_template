 Are you gonna pick me up after work? 
 Yeah, if I can. 
 Bye. 
 [Police Siren Bleeping] 
 [People Chattering] 
 My permits are up-to-date. Actors all have their H.I.V. Card. 
 What's my sh1t got to do with A.T. F? 
 Well, why should vice get all the fun, huh? 
 Ah. Viagra, poppers, blow. 
 Tools of the trade? 
 This is bullshit! 
 No, actually, it's possession. Maybe even intent to distribute. 
 Shut it down. 
 That's a wrap for Cecil B. DeMilf. 
 When's Donna getting back? 
 This morning. 
 You haven't said much to me since Oakland. 
 [Grunts] 
 I don't got much to say, I guess. 
 You were right. I wasn't ready. 
 It's done, bro. 
 You doing all right with all that? 
 I'm just a bit out of practice dealing with that sh1t, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 You know, it's about something bigger, man. 
 Club, family. 
 That got you past it? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey! I'm trying to run a department here! 
 Mind telling me how I'm gonna do that without an office? 
 You knew about this? 
 No one knew. I love a good surprise. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 I'm borrowing your house for a couple weeks. Gonna be a little tight. 
 And what's your business here? 
 What do you think, Chief? Huh? 
 I bet you've already made a call to Clay Morrow. 
 Your personal and professional relationship... with the Sons of Anarchy has been well documented. 
 Is that so? 
 Yeah. 
 Escort Chief Unser out. He poses a security risk to my investigation. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 You scrawny, uptight bitch. 
 You don't know sh1t about me or this town. 
 Why don't you take a little down time, Wayne? 
 Play golf, go fishing, get a round of chemo. 
 You know, relax. 
 Let's go. 
 You didn't have to humiliate the guy. 
 You're the one who got this ball rolling, sparky. 
 You want to play in my backyard or the cow pastures? 
 I want to stop Sam Crow. 
 Good. 
 Then let's catch up. 
 We know that the Sons are getting their guns in oil barrels from Dungloe, Ireland. 
 That's I.R.A. Territory. 
 True I.R.A. Territory. 
 These guys did not buy into the peace accord. 
 The guns are how they keep their pro-Irish agenda on fire. 
 Michael McKeevy. Big Irish player. 
 He was found beaten to death two weeks ago. 
 Pier 56, Oakland Shipyard. 
 You think this was Clay? 
 No, I don't. 
 I think it was this guy. Brenan Hefner, Oakland Port Commissioner. 
 Very dirty. I think that a deal went south and Hefner killed McKeevy. 
 Who killed Hefner? 
 Sam Crow. 
 McKeevy was a friend. Hefner was an obstacle. 
 He was found gunned down in the projects. 
 Oakland D.A.'s gonna keep me informed. 
 This intel, the murders we had here last week, this all points to the Sons. 
 Yes. And I've got sh1t to convict. 
 It's all circumstantial evidence. 
 That is why I am going to use RICO. 
 We need to prove that the Sons of Anarchy... 
 is an ongoing criminal enterprise. 
 And how does Luann Delaney play into this? 
 We have to show that there's been illegal activity over the past 10 years. 
 So we use Luann's incarceration as a bargaining chip... 
 with her husband Otto Delaney. 
 We dig up the dirt in the past. And then we go after the present. 
 These guys will never rat. 
 You're really missing the theme here, honey. 
 Outlaw clubs... do not keep their women in the dark. 
 They're smart. They use them. 
 We go after the ones who have the most to lose. 
 Job... family, freedom. 
 She's not one of'em. Tara's not one of them. 
 Well, we've had surveillance on the club for the last four days. 
 And, uh, Tara has spent every night there. 
 Kohn was right. He pushed her straight into Teller's arms. 
 What's the matter, Deputy? 
 You got a little stiffy for Miss Tara? 
 Tara, she- 
 No, she's just an old friend. 
 [Door Opens] 
 Where should I put these? 
 Put those in my office. 
 [June] Thanks, Bill. 
 [Door Closes] 
 I really don't get it.

 Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee- 
 [Door Opens] 
 Excuse me. 
 Sorry. 
 Missed a few Sundays. Trying to catch up with that. 
 [Scoffs] Yeah. 
 You a Catholic? 
 I'm whatever I need to be. 
 [Cell Phone Rings] 
 Hey. 
 How's the Irishman? 
 [Sighs] 
 Blessed art thou among women- 
 Divine. 
 He hasn't left the cabin yet, has he? 
 Oh, no. Today's the first day he's been on his feet. 
 Make sure he stays put. Unser just called. 
 That A.T.F. Bitch is back in Charming. 
 Oh, sh1t. What's going on? 
 Oh, I'm not sure yet. But, uh... if Cameron's anything like McKeevy, he's probably on a dozen federal watch lists. 
 Gonna have Happy come down, smuggle him out up north. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ, Clay. 
 I know. 
 We'll get through it, baby. We always do. 
 Be careful. 
 What's going on? 
 Feds are back. 
 Gotta keep you up here till we can get you out. 
 Do you believe in God, Gemma? 
 [Sighs] 
 I believe in family. 
 Think that's enough? 
 Who you kiddin'? 
 Sitting here ticking off Hail Mary's. 
 Think that gives you some kind of heavenly pass? 
 God's gonna open the pearly gates... when those next two bullets catch you in the head? 
 It's all a little absurd, I guess. 
 Mmm. 
 Truth is I know I'm going to hell. 
 Praying just makes my time here a little less miserable. 
 A few acts of contrition can make you feel good too, love. 
 There's only one way these beads could make me feel good... 
 Iove. 
 And it involves a whole different act. 
 It must be hard with two kids, a full-time job... behind on the mortgage. 
 What is it? 
 $32,000 in credit debt? 
 We get by. 
 Or you get out. 
 And those moving boxes suggest the latter. 
 You're smart, Donna. 
 You get your kids and you get as far away as you possibly can... before Sam Crow rips your family apart. 
 It's only a matter of time before Opie's back inside again. We both know that. 
 I don't need a cop to tell me what's wrong with my family. 
 I don't know sh1t about Opie's club business. 
 And even if I did, I'd never rat on him. 
 Get out of my house, bitch. 
 Hey, Clay. I know we got cash tied up in the rebuild... but I was hoping to get my payout for Hefner. 
 I'm two mortgage payments behind. 
 You should've said something, man. Waiting for the cash wasn't mandatory. 
 I know. I was just trying to help the club. 
 That's all right. I'll pull it out of the treasury funds. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Hey, Ope. 
 You doing okay? 
 Yeah. Just- 
 sh1t at home. I got it handled. 
 What's going on with him? 
 His heart's in it. His head's someplace else. 
 Too much of that sh1t going around lately. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [Baby Crying] 
 Can I help you? 
 Dr. Knowles? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm Agent Stahl, A.T.F. 
 May I, uh- May I ask you some questions? 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm trying to wrap my brain around your history with Sam Crow. 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, your mom died when you were nine. 
 You left Charming and your drunk daddy 11 years ago. 
 Moved in with an aunt in San Diego. 
 My father's cousin. 
 Right, right. 
 You graduated U.C.S.D. With honors. You were top of the class at Loyola Med. 
 And you did your internship at Chicago Presbyterian. 
 Really very impressive. 
 Yeah. I know. I was there. 
 Yes. And now you're here... at St. Redneck's... getting dirty with the bad boys again. 
 How does that happen? Hmm? 
 My personal life is really none of your business. What do you want? 
 Fair enough. 
 Do you know of any illegal activity thatJax Teller or the Sons of Anarchy are involved in? 
 No, I don't. 
 Well, that was easy. 
 Well, listen, um, if you do think of something... or you see something that just doesn't feel right... would you please give me a call? 
 Mmm. 
 Thank you for your time, Doctor. 
 What exactly is it you're hoping to find? 
 Just wondering what digging up dirt on old girlfriends gets you? 
 Is that what Kohn liked? 
 Your inquisitive nature? 
 You know, I understand that he never got off the plane in Chicago. 
 He's M.I.A. 
 Threw away his career for love. 
 I just hope you're not doing the same, Doctor. 
 She knew all about me. She knows about us. 
 It's all smoke. Look, they got nothing on Sam Crow. 
 So now they're harassing people close to us. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You didn't say anything? 
 No. Of course not. 
 She mentioned Kohn. Said he was M.I.A. 
 Kohn was a wanted man. 
 He didn't show up in Chicago 
 'cause he didn't want to go to jail. 
 Probably halfway around the world by now. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Yeah, halfway. 
 This will never blow back on you. That's a promise. 
 I wouldn't let you get hurt. 
 Okay? 
 This should cover the mortgage, put a dent in some of the bills. 
 Where are the kids? 
 Next door. Nina's watching 'em. 
 So I don't get a say in any of this? 
 I didn't get a say in this decision, did I? 
 Right. 
 There was an A.T.F. Agent here this morning. 
 She's a real nasty bitch. 
 Grilled me about you, the club. 
 Said Sam Crow was gonna tear apart my family. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm moving in with my mom. 
 I'm gonna find a place near her where me and the kids- 
 Donna, just- 
 Why did you stay? 
 What do you mean? 
 When I was inside. Why the hell didn't you get out five years ago? 
 Our kids were babies. 
 Don't put this on the kids. 
 You knew that I was gonna go back to Sam Crow. What the hell else was I gonna do? 
 I'm not your brother. I'm not your dad. 
 Can't be a good ol' boy chucking wood from 6:00 to 6:00. 
 I earn with the club. That's what I know. 
 That's how I support this family. I'm doing this because of you! 
 Because I love you and the kids. 
 If you can't get behind that... keep packing. 
 I'm gonna see my kids. 
 [Door Opens] 
 [Door Closes] 
 [Sobs] 
 Gemma. Hey, Gemma. I gotta talk to you. 
 I didn't want to go by your place because I'm afraid the feds might be watching. 
 How do you know about that? 
 They just came to the nail salon looking for me. I called Half-Sack. 
 And the feds are going after all the women. 
 It's just a scare tactic. Tell them you open beers and suck dick. That's it. 
 They got nothing. 
 I haven't been completely honest with Half-Sack. 
 I don't like where this is going. 
 Yeah. I'm sorta married. 
 "Sorta"? 
 Well, he was a sadistic asshole. 
 He wouldn't divorce me, so I left. Took everything. 
 Took the car, I took the money, I took the dog. 
 You're wanted for grand theft. 
 And arson. I burned down our condo. 
 [Sighs] 
 Nice touch. 
 He was such a dick, Gemma. 
 Jesus Christ, Cherry. 
 It's actually Rita. 
 Cherry was our dog's name. And she died. 
 And I always liked it better than mine. 
 Well, that's sweet. 
 [Sighs] 
 What am I gonna do? I love Half-Sack. 
 It's going so good, Gemma. What the hell am I gonna do? 
 You gotta get outta here, Rita. 
 But I don't want to leave him. 
 They're gonna threaten you with jail time. 
 Yeah. But I'm not a rat. 
 You ever been inside? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [Grunts] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast. 
 sh1t. 
 [Handcuffs Locking] 
 [Groans] 
 Very impressive, Vicky. 
 Hard to find good help these days, huh? 
 Know what you mean. 
 That little tart doesn't know anything. 
 What about the p0rn star? We've got her in custody too. 
 She can probably teach you how to give a great hummer. 
 But I'm guessing you've got that covered. 
 I get by. 
 Picking off the ones that have the most to lose. 
 Smart. That's how I'd do it. 
 Yeah. I've seen you in action. 
 You almost killed that one with a skateboard, didn't you? 
 We've mended fences. 
 I guess so. What was she doing? 
 Asking for the queen's advice? What lies to tell? 
 I'll bet that there's... enough secrets in that pretty head of yours to bury an empire. 
 I'm just a wife and mother, darlin'. 
 You know, you might want to unscrew that pen1s sometimes. 
 It's fun being a girl. 
 And if you want me... you know where I live. 
 
 
 
 You're lucky, Rita. Nobody died in the fire. 
 Eh, I gave it my best shot. 
 Apparently he was more upset about losing his dog than you. 
 It was my dog. 
 Mmm. 
 What can you tell me about Indian Hills, Nevada, hmm? 
 Sons of Anarchy patching over the Devil's Tribe? 
 Nothing. 
 Well, I doubt that. 
 You got balls, sweetheart. I'll give you that. 
 The club must have found you very resourceful. 
 Nothing. All right, we'll go with nothing then, huh? 
 I'll go start your extradition paperwork. 
 Extradition? 
 Yeah. Nevada, they, uh- they want you back. 
 Probably throw attempted murder at you-25 years. 
 You'll get out just in time for menopause, hmm? 
 You think about that for awhile. And we'll talk before you leave, okay? 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Got Luann on drug charges. Cherry on theft and arson. 
 That don't make sense. 
 Stahl's trying to use RICO. 
 If she can prove her case, she can take you all down. 
 And if we go down? 
 Why do you think I'm sitting at the goddamn table, Scotty? 
 We got anything to be worried about with the doc? 
 She's seen a lot of sh1t over the last couple of weeks. 
 Nah. 
 Little Miss Tara's the one who got A.T.F. Here in the first place. 
 We got nothing to worry about with Tara. I trust her. 
 [Door Opens] 
 Rosen can't get through to Otto in Stockton. He's on federal watch. 
 [Clay] Aye, yi, yi. 
 No calls, in or out. 
 [Clay] sh1t! 
 Stahl's pressing him for history, huh? 
 Using Luann as leverage. 
 Otto will never rat. 
 You know, if it was me, and they had Gemma... 
 I'd just give 'em something useless- some old sh1t wouldn't hurt the club. 
 With RICO, no info is useless. 
 The way Otto pines for Luann, he'll do anything he can to protect her. 
 Little Cherry pie knows all about Indian Hills. 
 Cherry would never say nothing. 
 Oh, yeah? You willing to bet your top rocker on that, prospect? 
 We all have our past and present indiscretions, boys. 
 Goddamn A. T.F. Bitch. That goddamn bitch! 
 Hey, they keep the girls in your cell overnight? 
 Yeah. 
 You still got your keys? 
 What are you thinking here? 
 Get a message to Luann. 
 She talks to Otto. She can warn him about Stahl using RICO. 
 What about Cherry? 
 We'll see where she's at. You think you can get me inside? 
 I doubt the feds are working round the clock. 
 But I got four guys, and dispatch on 11:00 to 7:00. 
 Well, maybe we come up with something. Keep them busy. 
 Well, you clear 'em out, I'll get you in. 
 What about, like, security cameras? 
 It's a police station. I got cops. I don't need cameras. 
 Maybe I should go with you, talk to Cherry. 
 No, retard, you shouldn't. 
 Me and Ope. 
 Everybody in favor? 
 Hear. Hear. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm good. 
 Put your goddamn hand down. 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Gavel Raps] 
 Otto, um, Agent Stahl, A.T.F. 
 Luann sends her best. 
 Too bad you don't have a sister prison. 
 You guys could, uh, visit each other, go to the dance together. 
 We raided your wife's studio. 
 Found enough narcotics to put her away for a dime, maybe more. 
 Jesus Christ, Luann. 
 Yeah, it's very sad. 
 All those teenage boys with nothing tojerk off to. 
 What do you want? 
 You give me something on Sam Crow, and I cut your wife loose. 
 You went after her to get to me? 
 [Laughs] It's a waste of time. 
 Turn the camera off. 
 [Beeps] 
 All right, look. 
 I'm gonna be straight with you, okay? 
 I got this bullshit case dumped on me. 
 Last thing I want to be doing is running around humping outlaw bikers. 
 I just need something to take back to my bosses. 
 If the intel leads nowhere, I really don't give a sh1t. 
 I know you have a parole up in three months. 
 If you help me with this... 
 I can make it happen this time. 
 And you'd throw me a recommendation? 
 Yeah, I would. 
 Luann walks, you get out of here. 
 And I get to move on to a real case. This is a win-win-win situation. 
 sh1t I know is all dead. I'm not plugged into Sam Crow anymore. 
 My boss doesn't know that, does he? 
 Just give me any old dead sh1t. I really don't care. 
 I want it all in writing. All of it. 
 And a conjugal. I want to see Luann. 
 I'll try and make that happen. 
 Okay. 
 [Door Buzzer Sounding] - [Door Opens] 
 I can stay. 
 No. Mm-mmm. 
 I gotta just be okay here, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna go. 
 Hey, what would have happened... if you'd left with me 11 years ago? 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't know, Tara. 
 What would have happened if you stayed? 
 Maybe I wouldn't have killed someone. 
 You didn't. 
 You're gonna get past this. 
 You won't feel like this forever. 
 Honestly, Tara. 
 Your mom says that I have to end this. 
 That whatever we're doing here can't work. 
 You believe her? 
 What is this? Is- 
 I mean, is it just about the Kohn thing? 
 What do you want? 
 I want you to stop listening to my crazy mom and get some sleep. 
 Well, we can't keep looking the other way. We need to think about this. 
 What the hell are we doing? 
 Do you love me? 
 It's a simple question, babe. 
 It's not a simple answer. 
 I know. 
 All right. 
 I'm gonna go. Okay? 
 [Door Opens, Closes] 
 ## [Country ] 
 You ever get high off of this? 
 It's just oxygen. 
 No, I know. I know. 
 But can't you turn it way up and get, like... you know, the Blue Velvet kind of thing going on? 
 [Sucking Sounds] 
 What the hell is wrong with him? 
 The list is too long, my friend. 
 Bobby, we should do this. 
 Yeah. 
 Listen, Bob. I'll do it. 
 What? 
 Don't worry. I'll do it. 
 All right. No, hey. 
 How's it going? How's it going? Huh? 
 Look, guys, uh... last thing I want to do is start any trouble. 
 My girl, she's Mexican too. These assholes over here at this table... the sh1t they're saying about her. 
 I don't want to bother you fellas... but I got a daughter at home just about her age. 
 And them rednecks over there are saying things about your girl that are more than rude. 
 They are downright disgusting. 
 Who said it? 
 It's that black-haired prick right behind me. 
 [Shouting] 
 ## [Continues] 
 Well done. 
 I do what I can. 
 Dispatch is in a separate office. She won't hear us. 
 Get to the cells through the back door. 
 Ope? 
 You here, man? 
 Yeah. 
 [Door Opens] - That's our cue. 
 [Sirens Wailing] 
 Stay here. Call if anyone shows up. 
 I thought you wanted me- 
 Just keep your eyes open, dude. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Car Door Closes] 
 [Cherry ] 
 Holy sh1t. 
 What are you doing here? 
 We think the feds are pressing Otto. 
 Something's going on. They're letting me see him tomorrow. 
 You gotta get a message to him. They're trying to use the RICO act against the club. 
 You gotta tell Otto he can't give them any info, all right? 
 Nothing. No matter how small or old. 
 sh1t. 
 Okay. 
 All right? 
 I'll tell him. 
 All right. 
 What are they asking you? 
 Jax, you gotta-you gotta take me with you, man. Please. 
 I can't. 
 That bitch wants to send me back to Nevada. 
 I'm gonna do hard time, like a hundred goddamn years. I can't do that. 
 Your mom's right. I'll rat if I stay in here. I'll rat! 
 Come on! Please. Please take me with you. 
 All right, shut up. 
 Come on. Come on. You okay? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the hell you going with her? 
 We gotta take this one with us. 
 You're breaking her out? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, aren't you the police chief? 
 I got no idea what I am anymore. 
 He's a friend. 
 Put her in the van. I'm gonna check your office, see what I can find. 
 Oh. Come on, little girl, before something else bites me in the ass. Over there. 
 [Woman Groaning] 
 Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. 
 [Moaning] 
 [Panting] 
 Now it's my turn. 
 [Zipper Unzipping] 
 I cannot believe we let them sneak her out under our noses while you and I are- 
 Ease up, sweetheart. Don't slit your wrists just yet. 
 Cherry was half your case. 
 Oakland D.A.'s office just faxed me these. 
 Turned up an eyewitness to Hefner's murder. I.D. 'd two guys. 
 Holy sh1t. Bobby Elvis. And this looks like Opie. 
 I sent their mug shots up this morning. We should have a positive I.D. By this afternoon. 
 Screw the tart. This gives us our present-day crime. 
 Now I am gonna go get me some yesterday. 
 Mmm! 
 Luann's immunity and your get-out-of-jail-free card. 
 You're, uh, missing a couple signatures. 
 Well, I sign off on them after you hold up your end. 
 I'm reaching in my pocket. Just a napkin. 
 Big hijack nine years ago. 
 Sam Crow, two other charters. 
 You type it up, I'll sign it... after you sign off on these. 
 Luann's freedom now, yours after you sign. 
 Fair enough. 
 Fair enough. 
 [Signing Document] 
 The warden would only give you 10 minutes with her. You do what you want with the time. 
 But, uh, the cameras will be on. 
 Sorry about that. 
 [Door Buzzer Sounds] - [Door Opens] 
 [Door Closes] 
 Our cargo's doubled. We got two heading out. 
 Chief Unser here has been kind enough to supply us with a truck. 
 Shipping manifests for two pallets of electronics. 
 180 pounds and 98 pounds. 
 That oughta get you and the cargo across the Canadian border without a stop. 
 Perfect. 
 This is my gift to you. You know my mom's real sick. 
 She's in a home in Bakersfield. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm thinking about going nomad. I can spend some more time with her. 
 You know there's always a seat at that table for you, my brother. 
 Thank you. 
 Absolutely. 
 Thanks, Bobby. 
 You let us know if your mom needs anything, killer. 
 Thanks, Tig. 
 [Chibs] Hap. 
 Let's move out. 
 See you, brother. 
 He seems like a nice fella. 
 Jax said A.T.F. Is using RICO against the club. 
 Are the feds pressing you to turn... because of me? 
 Oh, no, no, baby. No. I took care of it. 
 I got you clear. 
 Jesus, Otto. 
 Did you rat? 
 [Whispering] 
 If Clay sees I got out... he'll know you made some kind of deal. 
 You know what they'll do to you. 
 Don't worry. Baby, don't worry. 
 I'll get a message to the M.C. 
 Okay? 
 [Shudders] 
 I'm more worried about you. 
 You gotta be smart, Luann. 
 They'll do whatever they can to hurt us. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Crying] 
 Poor Otto. 
 Not even a hand job. 
 [Door Buzzer Sounds] 
 Is there anything else? 
 No, that's everything. 
 Sure? 
 Swear. I swear. 
 Well, I don't think I could ever get used to calling you Rita. 
 I don't want you to. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's all right. 
 [Knocking] 
 Wrap it up, kids. It's time to go. 
 I have something I want you to have. 
 [Both Laugh] 
 Cherry. 
 Cherry. 
 Don't forget me. 
 I just talked to Smith. 
 Eyewitness could only I.D. Bobby Munson. Couldn't get a positive on Opie. 
 Hmm. After this, they all go down. 
 [Groans] 
 You're healing nicely. 
 Thanks, Doc. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 His dressings need to be changed every day. 
 As long as he doesn't move around too much, he should be fine. 
 Thanks. 
 Did you sleep okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Irishman good to go? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks, Doc. 
 Ready for the road trip, kids? 
 Just in case. 
 Be safe. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go, Cammy. 
 Thank you. 
 No more burning down sh1t. 
 Right.
