 ANNOUNCER: Last season on Sons of Anarchy... 
 JAX: Found a box in the storage unit. 
 It's, like, pictures and journals and things I never knew about him. 
 When you and dad hooked up, did he ever talk to you about his vision? 
 About what he wanted from the club? 
 GEMMA: This was in one of his boxes. 
 He wrote it all down. 
 John is speaking to him from the Goddamn grave. 
 OFFICER: Robert Munson, you're under arrest for the murder of Brenda Hefner. 
 CLAY: ATF says they've got an eyewitness. 
 JUICE: We checked Opie's finances. 
 Somebody paid off a huge chunk of his debt. 
 Federal wire transfer. 
 STAHL: I figured, the least I could do was pay off some of those big bills of yours. 
 OPIE: I know how this looks. 
 She set me up to look like a rat. 
 It's all a lie. 
 Am I good with you, Clay? 
 CLAY: Yeah. 
 TIG: Opie has turned on us. 
 This has got to happen, Clay. 
 His death never lands at our feet. 
 DONNA: Love you. 
 OPIE: Love you back. 
 TIG: What, a drive-by? 
 CLAY: Make it ghetto. 
 Make it gangsta. 
 (horn blaring) 
 TIG: sh1t. 
 OPIE: Donna! Oh... 
 (sobbing) ...God. 
 Oh, baby. 
 HALE: I knew Stahl was setting Opie up as a rat. 
 I think Clay tried to have him killed. 
 PINEY: Someone last night, in a gangsta SUV gunned down my daughter. 
 LAROY: It wasn't us. 
 Niners didn't kill your daughter. 
 GEMMA: Jax knows something about Donna. 
 He knows everything. 
 JAX: Did you try to kill Opie? 
 CLAY: I love Opie. 
 Love Donna. 
 I'd never do nothing to her. 
 JOHN: To my oldest, wisest friend. 
 What we started was a good thing. 
 This book is for all the things we wanted and all the things we still can be. 
 PINEY: Time for a change. 
 JAX: Yeah.

 TIG: Sack, new targets. 
 Put them up. 
 Put them up. 
 CAMERON: What do you think, gentlemen? 
 CLAY: All right, let's talk. 
 HALF-SACK: Okay! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! 
 That was my... 
 (shouting) 
 Yeah, way to go... 
 You're going to blow off my one last nut. 
 Great sponsor. 
 CAMERON: The Russian pipeline's dried up. 
 We've hooked up with a source out of Jebalia. 
 Run them through Dungloe. 
 CLAY: How do these break down to ship? 
 CAMERON: They don't. 
 Come assembled. 
 TIG: That's not our business. 
 CAMERON: I know. 
 CLAY: Where you going with this, Cam? 
 CAMERON: True IRA is picking up momentum. 
 North country's getting hot and we need to step up our cash flow, keep the anger focused. 
 JAX: You want the Sons to run them? 
 EDMOND: Northern Cali, Oregon, Washington. 
 CLAY: I don't know if you heard, but we got out of the errand business sometime back. 
 We buy wholesale, we assemble, we sell retail. 
 End of story. 
 TIG: Yeah. 
 CAMERON: Come on, Clay. 
 We both know you still got an ATF target on your back. 
 You really think it's safe filling this new space with illegal gun parts? 
 JAX: What's your deal? 
 CAMERON: We sell, ship, store. 
 You load your saddlebags, deliver. 
 Charter to charter. 
 Give you 20%. 
 We get 60%, we assemble our own. 
 EDMOND: You carry all the risk and overhead. 
 CAMERON: My son will be your point guy in Cali. 
 This is a win-win, Clay. 
 (Clay sighs) 
 We'll let you talk it through. 
 Come on, Eddie. 
 CHIBS: It's bullshit. 
 They've still got access to the Russian surplus. 
 They're just trying to stonewall us till we play along. 
 They're Mick pricks. 
 JUICE: He's right about the Feds. 
 Doesn't matter what dummy corp we use or how far off the grid we are. 
 If ATF puts a tail on any one of us, we're going to lead them right back here. 
 CLAY: What do you think, VP? 
 JAX: Go get the Irish. 
 JUICE: Yeah. 
 You get us the Russian guns we need to keep our Oakland business intact. 
 We use your facility to store and assemble. 
 Then we'll run your hardware up the coast. 
 But MC Pony Express is going to cost you 30%. 
 EDMOND: 25. 
 JAX: 28. 
 And the Russian stock. 
 CAMERON: Okay. 
 JAX: It's a temporary fix, boys. 
 Keeps us in the gun business till the heat wears off, and we're running out of road here. 
 Call a vote, Pres. 
 CLAY: All in favor? 
 Deal. 
 STAHL: Release papers. 
 Your lawyer has already been through them. 
 Read them, initial the boxes, sign them, and we'll have you home by the end of the day. 
 BOBBY: Rosen told me my case was thrown out three weeks ago. 
 You mind telling me why I'm just getting cut loose now? 
 The witness went missing. 
 State Attorney dismissed the case, but we can detain for up to 30 days, in the hopes that the case gets reinstated. 
 It didn't. 
 BOBBY: That's it, huh? 
 Your pretty face gets smashed in, you spend months, how many thousands of dollars trying to crush us? 
 What for, bitch? 
 What do you get? 
 STAHL: Peace of mind. 
 (door opening) 
 CHIBS: Now that we're keeping the Oakland business, who the hell we gonna sell guns to? 
 Niners? 
 Mayans? 
 Who? 
 CLAY: Opie back yet? 
 JAX: Today. 
 CLAY: All right, let's sit down, figure out the move. 
 JAX: Yeah. 
 We should do that. 
 TIG: Cap. 
 Opie's going to want payback for Donna's death, right? 
 Jax and Piney both know it wasn't the Niners. 
 Any ideas where the hell we're going to land with this? 
 CLAY: Give Trammel a call. 
 WeWe're gonna need some police intel. 
 TIG: I can do that. 
 ZOBELLE: Must be very frustrating, Mr. Hale. 
 JACOB: Every surrounding town from Stockton to Lodi has grown nearly 70% in the last two decades. 
 ZOBELLE: Except Charming. 
 JACOB: SAMCRO has sabotaged every major development effort that's come through Charming. 
 Coercion and violence. 
 WESTON: Easy to do with the local cops in your pocket. 
 JACOB: Kid brother will be chief in two months. 
 Things are gonna change. 
 My family built this town. 
 My great great grandfather, his brothers. 
 Before my old man dies, the Hales are going to give it back to the folks who live here. 
 ZOBELLE: And that salvation nets you a tidy real estate profit. 
 JACOB: Progress has rewards. 
 ZOBELLE: I'm sure we can find a way to help each other. 
 JACOB: David, glad you could join us. 
 I'd like you to meet Ethan Zobelle, AJ Weston. 
 HANNA: Can I get you anything, David? 
 HALE: Just some coffee, Hanna. 
 HANNA: You got it. 
 HALE: So, what's this about, Jake? 
 ZOBELLE: I reached out to your family, asked for an introduction. 
 JACOB: Ethan owns cigar shops. 
 Stockton, Alameda, Millbrae. 
 HALE: Planning on opening a shop here in Charming? 
 ZOBELLE: I had my eye on a storefront. 
 WESTON: We'll need to know we've got the right support before we commit to Charming. 
 HALE: Support? 
 WESTON: To protect our investment. 
 ZOBELLE: We're aware of your outlaw problem. 
 Your brother's brought me up to speed on your struggle. 
 HALE: I'm guessing this isn't about cigars. 
 JACOB: Ethan shares a common interest. 
 ZOBELLE: The Sons of Anarchy have been supplying weapons to gang members for over a decade. 
 It's time it stopped. 
 HALE: League of American Nationalists. 
 ZOBELLE: The League represents an influential group of businessmen who are tired of criminals undermining local enterprise. 
 HALE: Right. 
 And how many black and Latino businessmen in your influential group? 
 ZOBELLE: None. 
 HALE: None. 
 I know who you are. 
 White hate. 
 ZOBELLE: Quite the opposite, Deputy Chief. 
 We are separatists, not supremacists. 
 We are God-fearing patriots, and in a time when black radicals are in power in this country, we are desperately trying to remind our citizens of their founding beliefs. 
 HALE: That all white men are created equal. 
 The hell do you want from me? 
 WESTON: Call us what you want. 
 We have the same goal. 
 Stop scumbags from arming scumbags. 
 ZOBELLE: We just want you to know we are at your disposal if you need us. 
 JACOB: Come on. 
 David. 
 I'm sorry. His, uh... self-righteousness gets the best of him. 
 ZOBELLE: Ah, I admire his frankness. 
 JACOB: Davey! 
 HALE: Do you know what those guys do? 
 Since when do you smoke up with neo-Nazis? 
 JACOB: I know who they are. 
 I'm not an idiot. 
 Charming is our town, Davey. 
 Dad tried for years to get it back from SAMCRO. 
 He couldn't, but you and me, we can. 
 HALE: I'm not going to swap one outlaw for another one. 
 JACOB: The League's got no interest in Charming. 
 For them, it's all about race. 
 HALE: And that makes it okay? 
 JACOB: Grow up, little brother!

 OPIE: It's good to see you, brother. 
 JAX: Yeah. 
 How was the walkabout? 
 OPIE: I'm doing okay. 
 JAX: What's this? 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Panhead EG. 
 '63? 
 OPIE: '65. 
 JAX: Where'd you find it? 
 OPIE: CHP pulled me over outside of Ukiah. 
 Started bullshitting with me. 
 They turned me on to this used parts guy. 
 Electra Glide was just rotting behind some garage. 
 It's all there-- stock. 
 JAX: That'll keep you busy. 
 OPIE: That's the plan. 
 JAX: I missed you, bro. 
 OPIE: How's everybody doing? 
 JAX: You know, gettin' it done. 
 We made a new deal with the Irish. 
 Gonna run handguns up the coast till the ATF heat dies down. 
 OPIE: What does that do to business? 
 JAX: We keep supplying Oakland. 
 We need to figure out who that supply goes to. 
 OPIE: Retaliation. 
 JAX: Yeah. 
 We're sitting down to figure it out. 
 Waited until you got back. 
 MARY: Hey, Jax. 
 JAX: Hey, Mary. 
 MARY: He's too skinny, right? 
 JAX: We'll beef him up. 
 MARY: Kids will be so glad to see you. 
 OPIE: I got some things to take care of. 
 You mind picking them up from school, Ma? 
 JAX: We can wait, man. 
 OPIE: No. 
 I'll see the kids later, Ma. 
 See you at the clubhouse. 
 JAX: Ope loves his kids. 
 We all just got to give him a minute. 
 MARY: Take care of him, Jax. 
 JAX: Yeah. 
 TARA: He's perfect. 
 GEMMA: The echoes? 
 TARA: Clean. 
 CBC, CMP's were all normal. 
 His weight needs to come up a little bit, but other than that... 
 GEMMA: But he's still real fussy with the feedings. 
 TARA: Could be the lactose. 
 We can try soy base. 
 GEMMA: I don't want to turn him into a little vegan pussy. 
 TARA: He can drink it in his wife-beater onesie. 
 GEMMA: Oh, Dr. Funny. 
 How's his sleep apnea? 
 You're there pretty much every night. 
 TARA: Times I'm there, he's sleeping fine. 
 GEMMA: Good. 
 HALE: Heard Ope's back. 
 JAX: Yeah. 
 HALE: You seen him? 
 JAX: He's doing okay. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Look, this guy's been through enough. 
 HALE: Yeah. 
 JAX: So whoever is responsible for killing Donna-- you and me can't prove it. 
 The suspicions we have don't help Ope. 
 HALE: Well, if he asks me, I'm not going to lie to him, just because I can't prove it was Clay. 
 JAX: Run it through, man. 
 What does it get anybody? 
 Turns Opie inside out. 
 He loses the only family he's got left. 
 Puts Clay on the attack. 
 He sh1ts in Unser's ear, it's gonna blow back on you. 
 HALE: All right, I'll protect Ope. 
 I'll keep my suspicions to myself, but you've got to do something for me. 
 Unser is in bad shape. 
 This guy should not be on the job. 
 He's got another two months on his extension. 
 After that, you got to let him step down. 
 JAX: I'll do what I can to make that happen. 
 GEMMA: Wade? 
 UNSER: Gemma. 
 The little guy doing okay? 
 GEMMA: Yeah. 
 Got to beef him up a little. 
 UNSER: (chuckles) 
 GEMMA: How about you? 
 UNSER: Right as rain. 
 This is just a follow-up. 
 GEMMA: Where are you at with it? 
 UNSER: The BCG's are keeping it contained to my bladder. 
 GEMMA: Guess that's good. 
 UNSER: Yeah. 
 GEMMA: You waiting on Della? 
 UNSER: She ain't a fan of hospitals. 
 Hale's picking me up. 
 GEMMA: We'll wait with ya. 
 (baby crying) 
 UNSER: I'm glad he's doing good. 
 I think Jax is going to make a real good daddy. 
 GEMMA: I'll make sure of that. 
 UNSER: No doubt. 
 GEMMA: It's for my heart condition. 
 UNSER: Miracle drug. 
 (whistles) 
 Hey, Jefe. 
 DARBY: Talked over your offer with my guys. 
 WESTON: Talked over? 
 It's a no-brainer. 
 DARBY: I'm a little fuzzy about your end in this. 
 What exactly goes into the League's pocket? 
 WESTON: You think this is about money for us? 
 You got kids, Darby? 
 DARBY: No. 
 WESTON: I just pulled my six-year-old out of tee ball 
 'cause I found out they're giving trophies to every boy on every team for simply playing the game. 
 Trophies should be earned. 
 Teaching children that everyone's equal is a dangerous philosophy. 
 But maybe you've lost sight of that. 
 DARBY: Business is down 30%. 
 I can't afford the white guys. 
 WESTON: Never put money before race. 
 This is $5,000. 
 It should get you operational inside Charming. 
 DARBY: When Clay finds out that I'm dealing crank and pussy in his backyard... 
 WESTON: There's a phone number inside the envelope. 
 Call it and tell our Aryan brothers how much manpower you need. 
 And if I were you, I'd button your shirt. 
 DARBY: I got nothing to hide. 
 WESTON: It's not about hiding-- you haven't earned it. 
 JAX: I talked to Hale. 
 He understands. 
 PINEY: Right. 
 JAX: Hey... keeping this between us is the best thing for now. 
 You hear what I'm saying, Piney? 
 PINEY: Clay tried to kill my son. 
 He slaughtered his wife by mistake. 
 I'm depending on you to make that right, kid. 
 JAX: Look, you got to trust me, Piney. 
 Me fixing things doesn't happen quick or easy. 
 Right now it's about protecting Ope. 
 PINEY: Yeah, we'll see. 
 CLAY: I haven't been able to say this yet on a club level. 
 We're all broken up about what happened to Donna. 
 She was a great girl. 
 I know how much you loved her. 
 She sure loved you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 OPIE: Thanks. 
 CLAY: Now we got to deal with the underbelly of this. 
 Those bullets that killed her-- they were meant for you. 
 We gotta settle that. 
 OPIE: Had to be the Niners. 
 Unser said it was a gangsta SUV. 
 Black guy driving. 
 TIG: No one saw who was driving, Ope, no one. 
 We're pretty sure the guy was not black. 
 CLAY: He was brown. 
 OPIE: Mayans? 
 How do you know? 
 CHIBS: Jax and Piney talked with Laroy. 
 So we know it wasn't the Niners. 
 PINEY: That's right. 
 As far as Laroy is concerned, the Niners and the SOA are good. 
 OPIE: And you believed him? 
 JAX: Yeah, we did. 
 I know the truth when I hear it. 
 TIG: It's got to be Alvarez. 
 He thinks we set him up. 
 We took his money, then we left him behind to get shredded by the Niners. 
 CLAY: I had Trammel look into it. 
 Black Range Rover got jacked outside a bar in Alameda that same night. 
 It turns up two days later, a few miles down the road from the Mayan clubhouse in Heyward. 
 Mac-10 casings on the floor-- same kind of gun killed Donna. 
 TIG: There was prints on the dash. 
 Before the end of the day, we're gonna know who was driving. 
 CLAY: I convinced Trammel to let us handle the arrest. 
 OPIE: I'm the one who kills him. 
 CLAY: Agreed. 
 You, Tig and Chibs. 
 JAX:  And me. 
 OPIE: I want Jax. 
 CLAY: All right. 
 JAX: Looks like Trammel earned his pay. 
 CLAY: You got something you need to say? 
 JAX: We both know this is bullshit. 
 The only reason I don't set fire to it is 'cause I love Ope. 
 And the truth would kill him. 
 CLAY: WE all love Ope. 
 He needs this. 
 And we're gonna give it to him. 
 JAX: Whoever you put this murder on, just make sure they deserve to die. 
 'Cause the guy that killed Donna is out there sharing a beer with her husband. 
 CLAY: You'd better be real careful how you navigate around this one. 
 JAX: Or what, you gonna put a bullet in the back of my head, too? 
 OPIE: That's him. 
 Restocking his dealers. 
 JAX: Elian Perez. 
 Out of Corcoran three months ago, manslaughter. 
 Chinese menu of drug and assault charges. 
 TIG: How do we want to do this? 
 JAX: Too many eyes here. 
 OPIE: He's on the move. 
 (rock music playing) 
 (tires screeching) 
 
 
 
 OPIE: This block's dead. 
 JAX: Yeah. 
 Take the wheel. 
 TIG: Here we go. 
 JAX: Yo, pull up on his left.

 Get up, get in the van. 
 Get in the van! 
 PEREZ: I know, man. 
 JAX: Come here. 
 TIG: Move it, move it! 
 (baby cooing) 
 GEMMA: Planning a trip? 
 CLAY: I'm just seeing what charters we're gonna need to make this thing work with the Irish. 
 GEMMA: If it involves you and a map, we're screwed. 
 CLAY: Saying I got no sense of direction? 
 GEMMA: I'm saying you need a GPS to get from the driveway to the front door. 
 CLAY: You know, I'd be lost without you, baby. 
 GEMMA: Got that right. 
 How'd it go with Opie? 
 CLAY: All good. 
 We determined it was a Mayan problem. 
 We're taking care of it. 
 GEMMA: Jax? 
 CLAY: He's on board, just like I told you. 
 GEMMA: Is that what you told me? 
 CLAY: Mm-hmm. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (baby crying) 
 GEMMA: I hired Neeta to help with him. 
 CLAY: Neeta? 
 Oh, jeez, there goes my underage nanny fantasy. 
 GEMMA: Actually... it's time for your 2:00 feeding. 
 CLAY: Ooh. 
 Oh... 
 (grunting) 
 OPIE: Tell me you did it. 
 PEREZ: What? 
 OPIE: Tell me you killed my wife. 
 PEREZ: I don't know what the hell you're talking about, man! 
 OPIE: Tell me you pulled up behind her and unloaded an entire clip into the back of her head. 
 PEREZ: No! 
 I didn't kill your wife, man. 
 You got the wrong guy, holmes! 
 JAX: Ope! 
 TIG: Go with them. 
 Go on. 
 PEREZ: This wasn't the Mayans, man. 
 Not our sh1t, I swear. 
 I've got no beef with SAMCRO. 
 JAX: The hell you doing, man? 
 OPIE: I'm not leaving here with any doubt. 
 JAX: The longer this takes, the greater the risk. 
 Ope, just do the guy. 
 Let's get the hell out of here. 
 OPIE: You guys can go. 
 I gotta do this my way. 
 JAX: Listen to me... 
 OPIE: If it was Tara who had her head blown off, you'd be ripping off that guy's fingers one by one. 
 I gotta know, Jax. 
 JAX: Okay. 
 (gun cocking) 
 PEREZ: What the hell are you doing, man?! 
 Let me go! 
 (yells) 
 What's going on, man? 
 I won't say anything, I won't! 
 No! No! 
 (gunshot, screaming) 
 CHIBS: Tigger! 
 TIG: Guy broke loose, reached for my gun, had to blow him up, man. 
 Sorry, O. 
 (groaning) 
 JAX: No doubt, bro. 
 This guy killed Donna. 
 (gurgling) 
 (gunshot) 
 (stabbing body) 
 (carving on flesh) 
 JAX: Jesus Christ. 
 OPIE: That's so Alvarez knows who and why. 
 JAX: Get rid of those guns. 
 You guys take the van, head back. 
 I'll dump the body. 
 CHIBS: You're dropping him on Mayan turf. 
 You can't do it on your own, Jackie boy. 
 JAX: You guys need to be there when the Feds drop off Bobby. 
 I got this. 
 Ope. 
 It's done. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Hey. 
 TARA: Hey, baby. 
 JAX: How's the kid? 
 TARA: That is one tough little man. 
 Labwork is all good. 
 Heart and tummy looking strong. 
 JAX: That's great. 
 TARA: You okay? 
 JAX: Yeah, I'm just in the middle of it. 
 TARA: Uh, am I gonna see you later? 
 JAX: I don't know. 
 I gotta drop something in Hayward, and then we got Bobby's party. 
 Gemma said she'd stay with the kid. 
 TARA: I'll come by, relieve her. 
 JAX: Okay, that'll be good. 
 TARA: Love you. 
 JAX: I love you, too. 
 (sighs) 
 (Half-Sack humming tune) 
 HALF-SACK: Oh, balls! 
 sh1t! 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I, uh... 
 I was just putting this here. 
 GEMMA: Either join in or get out, Sparky! 
 HALF-SACK: Okay. 
 You didn't really mean that you want me... 
 CLAY: Get out! 
 (door slamming) 
 (baby crying) 
 GEMMA: Oh, sh1t! 
 (laughing) 
 CLAY: Kids, huh? 
 I'm sorry, my love. 
 (baby crying) 
 I meant what I said, you know. 
 I would be lost without you. 
 GEMMA: I'm right here, baby. 
 That's my good boy. 
 (gunshots) 
 (shell casings clanging) 
 (distant crows cawing) 
 CLAY: We good? 
 TIG: Yeah. 
 Things got a little complicated. 
 CLAY: I want to know? 
 TIG: No worries. 
 Jax cleaned it up. 
 CLAY: Think this moves him past it? 
 TIG: Opie? 
 I don't know, man. 
 He's working some sh1t out. 
 PINEY: You should go home. 
 See your kids. 
 You know, I don't give a sh1t how bad you feel. 
 You need to pull your sad little head out of your ass and go be a father. 
 I'm tired of carrying your damn water, boy. 
 It ain't your fault, and it sure as hell ain't theirs. 
 OPIE: Love you, too, Pop. 
 CLAY: What the hell is this? 
 Garage is closed. 
 ZOBELLE: We're not here for, uh, car repairs. 
 I understand you're a Camacho fan. 
 CLAY: Who are you? 
 WESTON: Just dropping by to give you a little friendly advice. 
 CLAY: And what advice would that be? 
 ZOBELLE: We feel it would be best for all concerned if you stop dealing arms to the One Niners and the Mayans. 
 (others snorting and laughing) 
 CLAY: I don't even know what you're talking about. 
 We're just mechanics and Harley lovers. 
 TIG: That's one of Darby's guys back there. 
 ZOBELLE: Mr. Darby is one of our supporters. 
 CLAY: Mm. Expensive car. 
 Hell of a suit. 
 All your teeth. 
 Must be the top of the Aryan food chain, huh? 
 ZOBELLE: What you do for a living is between you and your maker. 
 I'm not here to adjust your moral compass. 
 This is just a reality check. 
 You're a criminal and you're done selling guns to color. 
 (gun cocking) 
 Are you gonna shoot me, Mr. 
 Trager? 
 With all these witnesses? 
 CLAY: Look, uh, I don't know what Darby told you and, uh, I don't know what your angle is, but let me be real clear. 
 Nobody threatens SAMCRO. 
 And nobody tells us what we can and can't do. 
 Black, brown or white. 
 So, why don't you just climb back into your little German clown car and drive back to Nazi town? 
 'Cause the next time you piss all over my shoes, he will kill you. 
 I don't give a sh1t how many witnesses there are. 
 ZOBELLE: My shop opens in a few weeks. 
 Until then... enjoy. 
 Sorry, ma'am. 
 CLAY: I want to know everything. 
 JUICE: You got it. 
 CHIBS: Good work. 
 GEMMA: Who the hell's that? 
 CLAY: Ah, friend of Darby's. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 (loud rock playing) 
 (laughter and chatter) 
 BOBBY: Yo! 
 (all cheering) 
 CHIBS: Slam the bugger! 
 MAN: Put it on! Whoo! 
 BOBBY: Yeah! 
 (Clay laughs) 
 CLAY: Thanks for giving him a lift. 
 What do I owe you? 
 STAHL: No charge. 
 Enjoy the party. 
 CLAY: Hey, you want to stick around for a while? 
 I figure you can do some major damage to a stripper pole. 
 STAHL: You have no idea. 
 (crowd laughing and cheering) 
 CLAY: Bobby! 
 Welcome back. 
 (whistles and cheers) 
 (door opens, then shuts, footfalls) 
 GEMMA: Jax? 
 TARA: It's me. 
 I told Jax I'd come by. 
 GEMMA: You didn't need to do that. 
 TARA: I wanted to. 
 GEMMA: Come on. 
 There we go. 
 That's a good boy. 
 There we go. 
 You on the pill? 
 Just wondering. 
 You got that look. 
 TARA: The aching, empty-womb look? 
 GEMMA: Something like that. 
 TARA: You think I'm using Jax to get knocked up? 
 GEMMA: No. Jesus, I hope not. 
 You gonna trap someone, make sure they've got money. 
 TARA: Where are you on this, Gemma? Me and Jax. 
 GEMMA: What do you care what I think? 
 TARA: Jax cares. 
 GEMMA: You really want my advice? 
 Total disclosure. 
 TARA: What do you mean? 
 GEMMA: It's the only way it works with you and him. 
 You're too smart. 
 Too... too neurotic to live in the vague. 
 He needs to tell you everything. 
 No truth, no pussy. 
 You draw the line. 
 TARA: I'm not sure I want to know. 
 GEMMA: Then this will never last. 
 Did John Teller tell you everything? 
 GEMMA: You love the man... 
 you learn to love the club. 
 You can do that, there's no truth you can't handle. 
 Good night.
