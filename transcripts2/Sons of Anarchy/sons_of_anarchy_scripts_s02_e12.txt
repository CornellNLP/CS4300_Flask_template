 Previously on Sons of Anarchy: 
 I've had your privileges suspended. 
 The ruse you played with Filip Telford... faking symptoms to extend his critical status? 
 It was unethical and a breach of insurance law. 
 Thanks, Doc. 
 Hello? 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Where's you dad, shithead? 
 I ain't telling you sh1t, race traitor! 
 Call Child Services. Have this little psychopath committed. 
 Ethan Zobelle is stealing your gun source. 
 What do you want? 
 Jimmy O'Phelan. 
 I know that you two have history. 
 He stole your wife, raised your daughter. 
 You will be registered as a confidential informant. 
 I've given you Edmond, and now you're dicking me around? 
 I was trying to tell Jimmy. 
 Jimmy will kill both Fiona and Kerrianne to hurt me. 
 We're not gonna let anything happen to your family. 
 The night of Bobby's party, I was attacked. 
 Girl jumps out in a panic. 
 He's choking! Please help me! 
 There were three of 'em. They raped me. 
 When he spoke, I knew his voice. 
 Sorry, ma'am. 
 Zobelle's right hand... Weston. 
 How do you want to handle it? 
 We kill 'em all. 
 Come on, little man. 
 Here you go. 
 Don't worry, baby. 
 Strap in, sweetie. 
 Take care of yourself. 
 Everyone's in. 
 Okay, good. 
 Lock it down. 
 Come on. Let's go! 
 Hey, lock it down! 
 Everybody! 
 Listen up! 
 Ok. 
 I want to welcome you-all to the Club Reaper. 
 I'm glad you made your reservations early 'cause, as you can see, we are booked to capacity. 
 You're here because you're family. 
 And because SAMCRO takes care of its own. 
 Next couple of days, this club's got some business to handle that could put our members and the people connected to us in... unfriendly situations. 
 Now, chances are, nothing's going to happen, but... people have already been hurt on my watch. 
 And that ain't ever going to happen again. 
 Nobody gets in. Nobody leaves without an escort. 
 You got a safety concern, you talk to Piney. 
 You got a comfort concern, you talk to my queen. 
 Under this roof, you'll all be safe. 
 Want you to make yourself at home. 
 I love all of you. 
 All right! 
 All right. 
 Got all the ammo. We just need the AKs. 
 We got two cases at the safe house. 
 The problem is, ATF will be sitting on it, waiting for Cameron to show. 
 And when he does, Stahl's going to get to Jimmy O and tag me the rat. 
 We're going to protect your family, Chibs. Already put a call in to McGee in Belfast. 
 Club's going to watch over Kerrianne. 
 And you should reach out to Fiona. Bring her in. We'll keep her safe. 
 I know. Okay, appreciate it, boys. 
 It's all just a precaution, bro. 
 We think we got a way to get our guns and convince Jimmy who the real rat is. 
 Right. 
 Lifted these from ATF before they left. 
 We show Jimmy that Cameron and Edmond have been under the ATF's thumb, should be enough to convince the IRA the betrayal's in-house. 
 Good. 
 And how do we get our guns from the safe house? 
 The old bait-and-switch. 
 We'll move on the Irish. 
 You, Ope, and Juice start spreading the racial harmony gossip, all right? 
 You got it. 
 Hey, Sack. 
 What happened? 
 My body rejected the implan I know. 
 Stupid idea. 
 Where is he at? 
 His year's up in about, uh, a month. 
 How is everybody feeling about him patching in? 
 Yeah. 
 Half a sack... shitload of balls. 
 Yep. 
 Hey, you let me know what Tacoma can do. 
 It's good you're here, man. We're going to need the muscle. 
 You okay with this, Tiggy? 
 Yeah, it's really great. 
 You want to kiss? 
 I'm not okay with this. 
 I couldn't tell. 
 You need to get out of my sight, or I'm going to do you serious harm for the upset you caused my kids. 
 Little Junior's a  psychopath. 
 Not here to  Here to educate. 
 Seems your great white hope only gives a sh1t about one color: green. 
 Zobelle is dealing heroin with the Mayans. 
 Those AKs that you took from us... gave them to brown to control the street. 
 You're talking out of your ass. 
 Yesterday, I followed Zobelle and one of your guys. 
 They met with Alvarez and left with a duffel of heroin. 
 Guess they've been keeping you out of the loop. 
 Lots of private meetings, AJ? 
 You being the true believer and all. 
 You need to leave. 
 Say hi to your kids for me. 
 We don't have much time. 
 For what? What's going on? 
 The feds may be closing in on Jimmy. 
 There's a chance it could blow back. 
 Did you rat him, Filip? 
 No. 
 But the ATF are threatening to tell that lie. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 If he thinks... 
 Clay's already tasked Belfast. They're going to watch over Kerrianne. 
 Oh, Filip. 
 What have you done? 
 Fi, you have to come with me. 
 We're in lockdown, and we can keep you safe if this thing goes bad. 
 Come with you? 
 Who do you think I am? One of your old ladies? 
 Jimmy'd kill me if he knew I was here. 
 I love my daughter. 
 And I love you, Fi. 
 I just want to take care of my family. 
 My sweet boy. 
 You never change. 
 Yeah. 
 We got a problem, Jimmy. 
 ATF's got a probe up your ass. 
 Jesus. 
 Where'd you get these? 
 Got Charming PD on the payroll. 
 ATF tried to use those to piss us off, hoping we'd turn on you. 
 We didn't. 
 Guess who did. 
 The boy. 
 Our guy in PD saw Stahl meet with him at the safe house. 
 Registered CI. nd the feds are still watching the house. 
 We can't get our AKs. 
 You coming with a solution? 
 Jesus, what are you doing here, Pol? 
 I told you. 
 Things are crazy for us. 
 So that's why you had to cut off my father's gun supply? 
 You're here on business? 
 Oh, sh1t. I've missed you. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 You want some coffee, doll? 
 I can get it. 
 I got it. Cream and sugar? 
 Uh, sure. 
 Black, two sugars. 
 They need to do that. 
 Show respect. 
 Oh, please. 
 Don't just toss that off. 
 You've earned that, sweetheart. 
 You're not just some crow-eater. 
 You're Jax Teller's old lady. 
 And that means something. 
 In this clubhouse, and in this town. 
 People need to show you respect. 
 And you don't take sh1t from anyone. 
 Past few months have been brutal. 
 For all of us... 
 Niners, Asians. Losing more than half of your H-territory to brown. 
 Sons struggling to reboot weapons. 
 p0rn business burned to the ground. 
 The Gaza connect is back on-line; our gun supply's being restocked. 
 So what? You can defend the little piece you got left? 
 What about what you lost? 
 You're gonna need help. 
 Not looking for partners. 
 Neither are we. 
 We ain't talking about a partnership. 
 Talking about an understanding. 
 We all have a common enemy. 
 Alvarez is running proxy for a bigger player, backed by the AB. 
 Ethan Zobelle... 
 League of American Nationalists. 
 sh1t. 
 Those crazy peckerwoods? 
 They all talking about God's plan for a free world without plan for a free world without color. 
 Without SAMCRO. 
 He's pushing us out of our own town. inanced by your hard-earned drug money. 
 Zobelle's the one arming the Mayans, helping 'em take over heroin. 
 We stop Zobelle, Mayans lose their guns and they lose their power. 
 Then we help you take back what's yours. 
 For a little extra. 
 All the Mayan territory. 
 Wipe 'em out. Split it up. 
 Henry, you get everything south of Ghosttown. 
 Niners, you take everything north. 
 Friendly borders means we could focus on business, instead of staying alive. 
 Agreed. 
 All right. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Don't. 
 Look, this is sanctioned. 
 Zobelle knows all about this. I swear. 
 Where are the guns? 
 The Mexicans. Don't be... 
 You need to put ointment on these burns every few hours. 
 Otherwise you run a pretty high risk of infection. 
 Man, you must've really pissed somebody off. 
 My personality is such that there's no middle ground. 
 People either love me or loathe me. 
 Jesus Christ, you just won't die. 
 He showed up at the gate. He has some eyewitness intel on the Caracara. 
 C'mon, Doc. 
 Let's go run those errands. 
 You take somebody. 
 Yeah, baby. 
 Don't worry. I'll put someone on her. 
 Thanks, old man. 
 What'd you see? 
 Three or four of 'em. 
 Looked like they all had Aryan ink. 
 They called one of 'em "Westing." 
 Weston? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 That son of a bitch. 
 They splashed gasoline everywhere. They set the place on fire. 
 Could you identify Weston? 
 Got a pretty good look. 
 Arson claims are keeping us from collecting on a fire insurance. 
 Chucky should share the information before he goes MIA again. 
 Prove to them that we didn't start the fire. 
 And collect a very big check. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Do that. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Chucky, why don't you go wait by the chief's car. 
 Play with the siren. 
 Really? 
 Sure. 
 So, we planted the seed with Weston. 
 He knows about Zobelle being in bed with the Mayans. 
 Zobelle'll be unprotected, and Weston will be making all his own decisions. 
 Hopefully irrational ones. 
 We might need help inciting him. 
 See you later. 
 Girl's on the move. 
 Where's your father, hmm? 
 He's the one that you're supposed to be bringing around, not Zobelle's little bimbo. 
 I know you listened in on Jimmy's call. 
 Now you don't need my dad. 
 Jimmy'll be picking up the guns himself and delivering them to Clay. 
 You'll get him and the Sons in one move. 
 Well, you're not really in any position to tell me... 
 I can tip off Jimmy with a look. 
 He'll walk out of here with nothing.  
 He'll be out of the country in a heartbeat. 
 Hmm. That Catholic guilt kicking in, Eddy, hmm? 
 You feeling bad about giving up your dad? 
 Yeah. 
 You must be feeling real stupid about him shaking your ATF tail. 
 You know you had better play thi the right way. 
 If I do... me and my dad walk? 
 Yeah. 
 When I arrest Jimmy and Clay. 
 But if you screw me, little boy, I'll bury you. 
 Buon giorno. 
 Where have you been? 
 Just running some errands. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You smell of him. 
 The Irishman. 
 You are sleeping with him, yes? 
 Or is someone else's odor staining your fingertips. 
 I just went to find out about our guns. 
 And somehow that led you to his bed? 
 You have feelings for him. 
 You gave our guns to the wetbacks! 
 What are you talking about? 
 Where is Ule? 
 Dead. 
 So is the slave labor. 
 What the hell have you done? 
 Me? 
 You lied. 
 You race-traiting son of a bitch! 
 You lied to all of us. 
 AJ, AJ, AJ... you know who I am... 
 A scumbag running dope with wetbacks! 
 It's my job to think about the big picture. The sad truth is, once you control the drugs, you control the city. 
 I need... we needed the Mayans to do the dirty work. 
 I did not lie to you. 
 Back off. 
 Polly... 
 Now. 
 Goddamn it. 
 Get out! 
 Stay calm, everybody. No need for this. 
 Please, please. 
 It wasn't about taking over cities. 
 It was about stopping color from getting stronger. 
 And now, you piss in the face of our cause: white America. 
 A future for my boys. 
 You make me sick. 
 Yeah? 
 
 
 
 Cliffy? 
 What does this mean? 
 Call Deputy Chief Hale. 
 Tell him somebody threatened your life. 
 He will send somebody to keep you safe. 
 Where are you going? 
 To secure new protection. 
 Let's get in the van. 
 Cliffy! Duke! 
 What the hell is this? I'm their father. 
 Your two sons were left alone in your house with access to loaded firearms. 
 They know how to use them. They're not ghetto kids. 
 They're smart. 
 They're ten and six. It's unconscionable. 
 It's okay, boys. I'm gonna get you out. 
 That won't happen without a hearing. 
 They'll be placed in our group facility until then. 
 Was this you? 
 Just protecting the children. 
 See your kids are taking that little trip I arranged. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 I'll kill you for this. 
 At least I didn't gang-rape them. 
 You want to kill me? 
 Time and place. 
 Timberland, 8:00. 
 Your ten best against mine. 
 Access Road L-4, off the main lumber drive. No weapons. 
 No witnesses. 
 Either you or me goes home in a bag. 
 I'll be there. 
 Somebody called Zobelle's daughter and threatened her life. 
 I got Ryan and Craft baby-sitting. This has to be Clay. 
 That don't make sense. 
 No? Does this make sense? 
 Sanwa County has a triple homicide. 
 Two Mexican women and one of Zobelle's lieutenants. 
 Murder wasn't Sam Crow. They're too smart to kill innocents. 
 Rage I just saw, I'm sure they could justify a little collateral damage. 
 We cannot turn a blind eye to bloodshed. 
 Ain't gonna be no bloodshed in Charming. 
 Just because they bury the bodies someplace else... 
 Our jurisdiction begins at the Lodi border and ends at the Wahewa land. 
 I can't be that kind of cop. 
 You told me to do my job. 
 I know. 
 And I got to do mine. 
 What is this? 
 Uh, he's got some info on an insurance beef. 
 I'm finished. 
 Howdy. 
 Grab Clemens and take an unmarked Sedan, head over to the Sons' clubhouse. 
 If Jax or Clay leave, you put a loose tail on them, and you let me know, okay? 
 Sure. 
 You want this? 
 Eyewitness testimony on the Caracara fires. 
 What? 
 Let's go. 
 Was your dad a Catholic? 
 No. 
 Superstitious. 
 You seem better. 
 Little more at peace? 
 You believe in God? 
 Not that god. 
 Something. I believe there's something connecting all of us. 
 You? 
 I believe we all got a job to do. 
 Fate. 
 Service. 
 Our lot. 
 For you, it's medicine. 
 You're a healer. 
 Nothing should ever stop you from doing that. 
 For you, it's family. 
 Yeah. 
 I get it now. 
 God wants me to be a fierce mother. 
 That's my path. 
 Plates match. It's O'Phelan's SUV. 
 Hello, Jimmy. 
 Esperate aqui. 
 Jimmy. 
 Guns are in the garage. 
 Good. 
 They'll load 'em. 
 Where'd you get the wetback? 
 Home Depot. 
 Short on manpower. 
 Where's your da? 
 Not sure. 
  Tell him we need to talk, yeah? 
 Yeah. Okay, Jimmy. 
 Okay. 
 We got confirmation. It's Jimmy O. 
 All right, we'll stay on the SUV; you grab Edmond. 
 Oh, what is this? 
 No! No! 
 Idiot. Jesus Christ! 
 Target's on the move. 
 Edmond confirmed. Jimmy and two others in the SUV. Guns on board. 
 It's all clear. 
 Gentlemen, your hardware. 
 Back, back. Keep coming. 
 Get it in, boys. 
 Ok. Good. 
 Glad we could move past our history, Filip. 
 Yeah. 
 Appreciate your reaching out to Fiona. 
 Nothing happens with Fiona that I don't know about. 
 How many times do I have to teach you that lesson? 
 You touch her or Kerrianne, and I will cut you into a million pieces. 
 We okay? 
 Yeah. Just, uh, swapping old Irish folktales. 
 We're done. 
 We got bikers. 
 SAMCRO is in the building Let's go. 
 ATF! Everybody down! 
 Easy. Okay. 
 Hands where I can see them now. 
 All right. 
 Where is he? 
 Jose here is the only one that got out of the SUV. 
 Get that Irish prick in here. 
 Let 'em up. 
 All right, fellas... where is Jimmy O? 
 Jimmy who? 
 sh1t. 
 Whoever Jimmy is, she doesn't like him very much. 
 We're just trying to buy some camping gear. 
 Open it. 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Can we go now? 
 Maybe we should wait for Galt P.D.,  
  file some assault charges. 
 Yeah. 
 You hit like a girl. 
 What the hell happened? 
 Jimmy happened. 
 And now because of you, me and my da are dead men. 
 You need to go find your daddy and bring him to me because right now, I am the only one who can pull your asses out of this Irish stew. 
 Bring him. 
 Hey, Irish, let's go. 
 I'm just completing my charts. 
 That should have been done already. 
 Yes, I know. 
 Well, you may not have to worry about paperwork after next week. 
 I pity you. 
 You walk around here with your little administrative degree, pretending like you know medicine. 
 You're just a cheap suit. 
 Too stupid and lazy to get into med school. 
 So now you compensate by making the healers jump through hoops. 
 Well... someone's true colors have finally bled through. 
 I guess you and that biker whore you travel with... 
 How dare you? 
 You don't know her. You don't know any of them. 
 Oh, my God. You hit me. 
 You are finished. I'm calling security. This is assault. 
 No. 
 That's assault. 
 I know where you live, where your kids go to school. 
 SAMCRO has the cops on payroll, this town in its pocket. 
 You say a word about this to anyone, it'll be the biggest mistake of your little red life. 
 Do you understand what I'm saying? 
 And I suggest you drop this bogus claim against me. 
 There are a lot of people who need my help. 
 I love you, baby. 
 Be careful. 
 I love you. 
 Come here. Come here. 
 It's gonna be okay. It'll be all right. Let's get 'em inside. 
 Come on, kids. 
 Hey, Stumpy, come with us. 
 Hey, here they come. 
 Whatever happened to ten on ten, no weapons? 
 Guess you couldn't handle a fair fight, huh? 
 Fair is for losers. I'd rather win. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Put your weapons down. 
 Put them down. 
 Let's just stick to the plan. 
 Come on! 
 sh1t! 
 Let's go! 
 Come on. 
 Collect everyone. 
 Get out of here! 
 We ain't done yet. 
 I'm not going anywhere! 
 Black Ford truck headed southbound. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 This doesn't concern you. 
 You're inside Charming! 
 Who the hell else does it concern? 
 Go home, Deputy. 
 There's no crime here. 
 AJ Weston, you're under arrest for arson. 
 Burning down Caracara. 
 Read him his rights. Clean him up. 
 AJ Weston, you have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law... 
 Call Unser. 
 Tell him to move on the cigar stuff. 
 Closing time. 
 Yeah, I guess it is. 
 What happened to the other cops? 
 Uh, they're, uh, off doing  something that matters. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Unser cut us loose. 
 sh1t. 
 Follow me. 
 Where's your father? 
 I don't know. 
 Now you get Daddy on the phone. 
 And you bring him here or I kill his little girl. 
 I don't know where he is. 
 Whoa, Clay, Clay! Hey! 
 She's as guilty as the rest of them. 
 Polly! 
 Polly! 
 Don't you move. 
 Welcome back. 
 What do you want? 
 Talk. 
 Outside Charming. 
 You're just gonna let this happen? 
 Walk out the door. 
 Walk out the door. 
 You want to kill me, do it here on Main Street. 
 Fine. 
 I was just trying to accommodate our friend with the badge. 
 Deputy Chief! 
 Deputy Chief, they struck my daughter. They threatened my life. Arrest them. 
 I've got this, Deputy. 
 What are you doing? 
 My shield still outranks yours. 
 And I'm telling my men, there's been no crime here, and there won't be one here. 
 Now all of you, just turn around and go back to the station house. 
 Go ahead. 
 Officers, my... my daughter and I are in possession of illegal narcotics. 
 There's a load of them under that cash register in the center drawer. 
 You can find them there. 
 It's here. 
 There, arrest us. 
 Do it! 
 Cuff them. Take them to the station. 
 We're gonna kill you.
