 Previously... 
 Feds raided Luann's studio. Asset seizure. Wiped her out. 
 She needs time and money to get up and running in a new space. 
 Your new studio. 
 Sam Crow as a partner? 
 50/50. 
 I'd like you to meet Ethan Zobelle. 
 AJ Weston. 
 I know who you are. 
 White hate. The hell do you want from me? 
 We just want you to know that we are at your disposal if you need us. 
 This is $5,000. 
 Should get you operational inside Charming. 
 Who are you? 
 Just dropping by to give you a {\little }friendly advice. 
 We feel it would be best for all concerned if you stopped dealing arms to the One-Niners and the Mayans. 
 You're done selling guns to color. 
 Nobody threatens Sam Crow. 
 Who the hell's that? 
 Friend of Darby's. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 My baby swallowed something. He's choking. Please help me. 
 I need you to pass on a message to your old man. 
 Tell him to stop selling guns to niggers and wetbacks or we find you and we do this again. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Get me out of here. 
 Promise me you won't tell anyone. 
 We got to tell Clay. 
 Not Clay, not Jax. 
 No one. 
 You're a bad boss, Mr. Draper. 
 Just like that. 
 Yeah, mommy. 
 Harder. Harder! 
 All right. 
 Big finish, Lyla. 
 Oh God. 
 Cut! 
 Check it! 
 Bravo. 
 Encore. 
 Riding through this world All alone God takes your soul You're on your own The crow flies straight A perfect line On the devil's bed Until you die Gotta look this life In the eye. 
 Episode 203 
 FIX Come to bed last night? 
 I can't get comfortable. 
 I didn't want to keep you up. 
 I'd rather you tossed next to me than on the couch. 
 This is... 
 starting to become a habit. 
 It's been, like, three weeks since... 
 I still got a lot of pain. 
 Then you should go see the doc. 
 I don't need meds. 
 Just need some time. 
 How much time? 
 I got to get to the office. 
 I just sat down. 
 I'm late. 
 List of repos came in from the dealer last night. 
 I'm trying to talk to you here. 
 Since when do you want to talk? 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. 
 I had to get some air in my tires. I figured I'd check in. 
 I'm fine. 
 Your face is healing. 
 Pretty as ever. 
 Thank you, Chief. 
 Something else? 
 I've been going to these meetings. 
 St. Luke's in Lodi. 
 Cancer survivors. 
 Support group? 
 I got to say, it's making a difference. 
 You going somewhere with this? 
 I saw on the board, church got a group for victims of sexual assault crimes. 
 It's out of Charming. 
 Anonymous. 
 How long you known me? 
 You really think that I'm the type of gal that joins some holy, poor-me circle-jerk? 
 Just a thought. 
 You take care. 
 Morning, beaut... 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Here's the repo list. 
 Why don't you get half-sack and Opie started on it? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Sad Elvis. 
 Blow me. 
 Goddamn Bar Mitzvahs are killing me. 
 Why you doing it, then? 
 Tahoe gigs will come back around. 
 I'm buried. 
 Inside for two months, child support, alimony. 
 My oldest needs oral surgery. 
 They got to cut his frenum. What the hell is a frenum? 
 Sounds Jewish. 
 Sounds expensive. 
 You're no use to us in the garage with that shoulder. 
 Why don't you take point up at Caracara? 
 p0rn. 
 I need a set of eyes up there I can trust. 
 I don't want it to turn into a goddamn Bukaki fest. 
 Run the books, keep everybody zipped up. 
 Take a salary. 
 Whose end? 
 Not ours. 
 Luann is going to sh1t. 
 Better things coming out of her ass then getting jammed back in it, huh? 
 All right. 
 Homework? 
 The Jungle? 
 You know it? 
 Almost turned me vegan. 
 This is... really twisted, but I'm actually craving a big steak. 
 I got a porterhouse right here for you, baby. 
 You're a class act, Teller. 
 Give me a kiss. 
 Here? 
 Just us carnivores. 
 It's you. 
 sh1t. 
 p0rn hotline. 
 How are you Jacky boy? 
 You better get over here, brother. 
 Why? 
 Bobby turned up, told Luann he's handling her books and sh1t. 
 He did what? 
 Who told him to do that? 
 Clay, I guess. 
 And Luann is freaking out. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 All right. 
 Chlamydia outbreak? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'll drop you at home. 
 Take me. 
 Yeah? 
 Maybe we can still salvage the day. 
 More repos. 
 Where the hell's Gemma going? 
 Caracara. I guess Luann's having some kind of a meltdown. 
 Stupid bitch. 
 I hate it when mommy and daddy fight. 
 Get to work, shithead. 
 Pretty sure he was talking to you. 
 Where are you going? 
 To protect Clay. 
 Clay Morrow and your boss with Laroy Wayne, runs the One-Niners, controls the largest heroine trade in three counties. 
 That's nothing I don't already know. 
 It's something to act on, Deputy. 
 Chief of police associating with drug kingpins? 
 Unser's done in six weeks. 
 And you'll be no better off than you are now. 
 Sam Crow will continue to vex. 
 That's my problem. 
 It's a difficult one. 
 Charming treats the Sons like heroes. 
 Some do. 
 You know, I can help you. 
 And how are you gonna do that? 
 Clay vows to keep Charming safe and drug-free. 
 That's why folks embrace the MC. 
 What happens to public opinion if he can't do that? 
 If drugs land in Charming, that's on me. 
 It's on Unser and Sam Crow is knocked off their iconic pedestal. 
 Then when you take over, the drugs go away. 
 Are you talking about deliberately bringing drugs into my town? 
 I'm talking about creating a temporary problem that allows you to flush out the permanent one. 
 ... head on over there, okay! 
 Sorry, I didn't know you had a visitor. 
 Deputy Chief, thank you for your time. 
 Ain't anybody gonna introduce? 
 Ethan Zobelle, Impeccable Smokes. 
 Cigar king. 
 That's right. 
 Gentlemen. 
 I'll wait. 
 Five minutes. 
 This is bullshit! 
 All right. 
 A manager? I'm getting shut out of my own business. 
 I'm just here to do the bookkeeping, darling. 
 Did you sign off on this? 
 It was a club decision. 
 Like I need this hassle. 
 I gotta finish this shoot, post an a**l rain dance and prep a sorority swing. 
 Look at it this way, Bobby handling the admin frees you up to do all the important sh1t. 
 What's an a**l rain dance? 
 Shouldn't you be polishing that bike, sweetie? 
 Jax likes it nice and shiny. 
 Where the hell you been, Ima? This is your movie. 
 I've been shooting around your sh1t all morning. 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I had to detour, okay. I think Georgie's following me. 
 Some goon almost ran me off the road. 
 Nah, relax, darling. We took care of that. 
 Georgie ain't that stupid. 
 Georgie's psycho. 
 What he did to Lyla, he could do to me. 
 I want Jax protecting me. 
 You know how easily I dry out under stress. 
 Look, she's got a thing for you. 
 So, just play along, calm her down. 
 She's our biggest draw right now. 
 You got no reason to be scared, darling. 
 We're here to keep you safe. 
 I don't know why I'm so freaked out, I just... 
 I was terrified. 
 What the hell you doing here? 
 Luann called. She's freaking out. 
 That's club business. You got no reason to intervene. 
 What... intervene? 
 She's my friend. She needs to talk. 
 So when she wants to talk, you what, drop everything? 
 Jesus Christ, what are you, three? 
 Get back to the garage. 
 Excuse me? 
 The last thing I need is for you running diva over a goddamn cum factory. 
 Asshole. 
 You stupid piece of sh1t! 
 Give me a call when you get finished. I'll make sure you get home safe. 
 He's occupied, honey. You should wait outside like you were told. 
 Okay, I'm sorry. 
 She's a little out of her mind. 
 She's not the only one. 
 Just what those arthritic mitts need, a good pounding. 
 You want to see a good pounding? 
 Come on, bad ass, lay hands on me. 
 I'll slit your goddamn throat! 
 You are pathetic! 
 Don't you touch... 
 Don't! 
 I hate doing this. 
 Recession's bad on payments, good on repo. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What? 
 That shithead's dealing. 
 Looks like one of Darby's guys. 
 You {\fellas }got a need? 
 {\A need for you }To take your sh1t somewhere else. 
 No one deals in Charming. 
 I ain't no one. 
 Aryans. 
 sh1t. 
 I'm pretty good with a crowbar but I can't deflect bullets. 
 Let's get some backup. 
 What do you got? 
 Zobelle's a goddamn saint. 
 He owns five cigar shops, deacon at his church, widower, one kid. 
 But look at this. 
 Last place the League of American Nationalists put down roots was San Bernardino. 
 Six months later, war boys MC crumbled. 
 Entire crew went away for aggravated assault, attacked Zobelle's cigar shop. 
 War boys run guns. 
 They did. 
 Why would Zobelle care about guns? 
 'cause these dickheads are prepping for the great race war. 
 Zobelle came at us hard. 
 Cocky threat. No fear. 
 He wanted to incite you. 
 So, what? 
 We own the law in Charming. 
 Unser, not Hale. 
 Maybe you got Hale. 
 If Hale could be bought, we'd have him. 
 Maybe we never offered him the right pay off. 
 Let's stick with the devil we know. 
 Darby's Lodi cook shops are all shuttered up. Maybe he's gone mobile. 
 Let's find those meth labs, okay? And now! 
 
 
 
 Ima called. 
 Miss double penetration is ready for you. 
 I'll be right back. Just gotta give her a safe ride. 
 A producer's work is never done, huh? 
 Should've given me a heads up about Bobby taking over Luann's books. 
 I brought this to the club. It's my action. 
 Bobby needs it. 
 He did two months inside for us. 
 Maybe it's time you start thinking about something other than yourself. 
 Hey, bro. 
 How's it going? 
 I thought this was gonna be a cush gig but Luann's accounts are a mess. 
 Missing receivables. Vendor files. 
 Guess her expertise lies in other areas. 
 You okay with this? 
 I know Clay made the call without you. 
 It's good. 
 It's good you're here{\, man}. 
 I know I can be of some help. 
 I don't know what kind of system she had. 
 Let me know if you need anything. 
 You and Clay. 
 The guys are worried. 
 Got nothing to worry about. 
 Convince me. 
 You talk to Clay? 
 Just father-son sh1t, you know. 
 We'll work it out. 
 It's all good. 
 I'm ready. 
 She's ready. 
 I got that. 
 You got a need, brother? 
 You got a 40 bag? 
 Relax, relax. 
 My foreman sees me, I'm screwed, man. 
 Over here, over here. 
 {\this ain't that, }This ain't that Mexican sh1t, right? 
 I'm all about "Made in America." 
 Where's Darby cooking the crank? 
 Let's see what his balls are made out of, glass or steel? 
 Charming. 
 Water Road, out by the streams. Shitty red house. 
 Thirsty? 
 HIV test. 
 You're due. 
 I haven't had s*x since it happened. 
 Make sense. 
 You're still healing. 
 Pussy's not the problem. 
 It's my head. 
 You need time. 
 I need something. 
 Where's Clay with all this? 
 Did you miss the car show earlier? 
 He hates me. 
 That's not true. 
 I don't know. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Thanks again, Jax. 
 I know I'm probably just overreacting, but you know. 
 It's all good, darling. 
 I'll see you tonight, okay? Wrap party. 
 You good with that rubbing on Jax? 
 I trust him. 
 It's not him you worry about. 
 It's them. 
 They think he's a free dick. 
 You gotta educate. 
 Set the bitch straight. 
 The others see it, everyone knows. 
 What, like, hit her? 
 Kick, scratch, whatever. 
 I'm not 18 years old anymore{, Gemma}. My catfighting days are behind me. 
 We'll see. 
 My pee. 
 Thanks. 
 Dealer said Darby's cooking down by the streams. 
 I know that part of Water Road. Only a few houses. 
 We find the right one, clear it out, burn it down. 
 You talking about blowing something up in our backyard. 
 That's exposure, Clay. 
 Don't see another way, brother. 
 Why don't we just tell Unser? 
 Let the cops actually do their job for once. 
 Doesn't send a message. 
 Zobelle's not a gangster. We don't know what kind of message to send. 
 All right. 
 We let the cops handle it. 
 Only we don't tell Unser. 
 We tell Hale. 
 If he buries the intel, we know he's on Zobelle's payroll. 
 I'm telling you, man, Hale's not working for white power. 
 So he shuts down the cook shop.{\, don't he?} 
 And if he doesn't, we do. 
 All in favor? 
 Sure. 
 You waiting for me? 
 Nords are dealing in town. 
 Found out where Darby's cooker is. Water Road, out by the streams. 
 In Charming? 
 Red house. Shouldn't be hard to find. 
 So now you're doing my job, too? 
 I'm telling you, we don't nip this now, Nords are gonna flood that mill with crank. 
 I'm not jerking you around, man. 
 I convinced Clay to let you guys handle it. 
 Do it by the book for a change. 
 Okay. Well, I'll take a ride out there. 
 What's so urgent, pres? 
 Darby's dealing in Charming. 
 You're kidding me. Is he smoking his own sh1t? 
 The Nords are running proxy for a bigger player. 
 I'm listening. 
 You been approached by anybody? 
 What about Hale? 
 He met with somebody earlier. 
 A friend of his brother. 
 Ethan Zobelle? 
 That's right. 
 Cigar guy. 
 He's the player? 
 He's part of a separatist group. 
 The suit and tie is just cover for white power. 
 You think Hale's cheek dancing with this scumbag? 
 A little out of character. 
 What's Hale want more than anything? 
 Hurt Sam Crow. 
 How does he do that, if not with the law? 
 We fed him some intel on where Darby's cooker is. 
 If he's in Zobelle's pocket, he'll bury it. 
 Keep an eye on him. 
 Help you, officer? 
 What the hell you doing out here{\, Darby}? 
 It's my little retreat. 
 Hunting, fishing. 
 You need industrial filters to cook fish? 
 You got a warrant? 
 Not yet. 
 From Ethan Zobelle. 
 Grand opening coupon. 
 See you there. 
 You already had Darby cooking meth. 
 I'm not responsible for Mr. Darby. 
 That your temporary problem, flooding the mill with crank? 
 Did you arrest him? 
 I didn't have a warrant. 
 So get one. 
 Maybe I'll pick up one for you, too. 
 I understand your anger. 
 And I know you think I'm some kind of devil. 
 For years, I sat back and watched everything I love about this country slowly unravel: faith... 
 Values... Morals... 
 Decency. 
 It culminated two years ago when my wife was killed in a drive-by. 
 Her blood got me off the sidelines and into the game. 
 Now if that makes me a vigilante, a machiavellian fool, so be it. 
 I despise drugs. 
 It's the last thing I would ever wish for Charming. 
 But we both know your methods for extracting the Sons of Anarchy have failed. 
 Because they operate outside the law. 
 If you're going to damage them, you have to dip into their cesspool. 
 It's ugly, it'll feel bad, but the result will be the salvation of Charming. 
 I'm on your side, David. 
 On your side. 
 That info on the lab, that's bogus. 
 There's nothing out there. 
 Get the boom. 
 You pulling me off the set doesn't... 
 Did you know that my old man was a bookkeeper for the mob in Reno? 
 Jesus Christ. 
 I'm in the middle... 
 Italians paid him a lot of money. 
 Do you know why? 
 Handled two sets of books. 
 Twice the work, twice the risk. 
 You've been running a skim since the very beginning. 
 By my calculations, you've been cutting us light for six years. 
 Otto gavemethis business. 
 Club's the reason he's in jail. 
 You can justify it however you want. 
 But you stole from us. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 It's a club decision now. 
 Please. 
 I'll pay back every dime. 
 Just take it out of my cut. 
 Club gets paid back, we don't break Otto's heart. 
 I don't think I can do that. 
 You ever see any of my movies? 
 You know what my specialty was? 
 Look, you're Otto's old lady. 
 But there's a prison clause. 
 That's got to be it. 
 Go. 
 Hold it! 
 Cameras. 
 We're set. 
 We'll clear the house, then blow it. 
 Clear. 
 Clear. 
 Clear. 
 Let's go, go. 
 Who's got the remote? 
 Ope's not using one. 
 Talk to her, man. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Me, too. 
 How are the hands? 
 They're both sore. 
 Yeah, I bet. 
 What's going on with us? 
 It's me. 
 My accident... it just shook me up somehow. I don't know, I... 
 Just having trouble. 
 How do I help? 
 I'm so sorry it's bleeding all over you. 
 I'm just a little lost, baby. 
 I got to get this software over to Bobby. 
 I'll run it up there. 
 I don't want you hanging around that place. 
 Okay. 
 There's a wrap party tonight. 
 The guys are going to be there. 
 I'm thinking of going. 
 Unless... 
 You want to maybe grab some supper or something. 
 I got to relieve Neeta. 
 You should go. 
 Okay. 
 What do we know? 
 It's a meth lab. 
 Somebody got sloppy with the cooking. 
 Everybody got out. There's no bodies. 
 I guessing this has got to be Darby's crew, right? 
 You got wind of anything? 
 No, nothing. 
 Nothing makes sense anymore. 
 You okay there, young fella? 
 I'm just a little sore. 
 Guess I'm not used to sitting behind a desk. 
 Thanks. 
 Crazy, huh? 
 Heard you went a little cowboy at that Mayan thing a few weeks ago. 
 The thing today with the explosives... 
 I don't have a death wish, man. 
 You got something going on. 
 I've got the club. 
 Just throwing myself into it. 
 You got kids, Ope. 
 Don't throw yourself too far. 
 This is a closed party. 
 I'm looking for Jax. 
 Honey, he's got all he can handle tonight, don't worry. 
 Yeah, I'm sure he does. 
 I said, get out, bitch. 
 That's right. You heard her. 
 What part of that is so complicated? 
 Get out of my face. 
 sh1t. 
 That's right, you'd better run, you little skank. 
 I'll be out in a minute. 
 Don't let 'em get to you. 
 Do they get to you? 
 We talked about this. 
 It's business. They're just...
