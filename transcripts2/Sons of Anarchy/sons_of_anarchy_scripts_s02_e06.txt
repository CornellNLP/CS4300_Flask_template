 Previously... 
 Keeping this between us is the best thing for Opie. 
 Clay tried to kill my son. 
 Slaughtered his wife by mistake. I'm depending on you to make that right. 
 Right now it's about protecting Ope. 
 We feel that it would be best for you to stop dealing arms to the One-Niners and the Mayans. 
 Nobody threatens Sam Crow. 
 My baby swallowed something! He's choking! Please help me! 
 About a month ago, I found Gemma Teller in the utility house off 18, beaten and raped. It was Zobelle's aryan crew. 
 Stockton called. Inside's a go. 
 Beating was from the league! 
 We underestimated Zobelle, the league's reach. 
 Now he hurts a brother. 
 Retaliation must be harsh and immediate. 
 I love Otto. I want to give him his eye, but not at the expense of my club. 
 Immediate retaliation. 
 Absolutely. 
 It's a no. 
 Four-four, no majority. We wait on retaliation. 
 sh1t! 
 I'll be right back. 
 Boy's got a strong constitution. 
 Anybody could take a blast, it's him. 
 I ran the registration and vin on the minivan. 
 Both bogus. 
 I need to know what happened. 
 Lot of volatile liquid here at the garage. 
 Forensics finds anything else, feds will be all over this place. 
 Bombs are Homeland Security sh1t. 
 You let 'em make the evidence point to what it was: an accident. 
 I know what you gotta do here, Clay, but we both know Zobelle has caused enough damage in this town. 
 What happened to Chibs cannot blow back in Charming. 
 Then you get me a home address on him and Weston. 
 They both live out of town. 
 Otherwise, I do it here. 
 And then you'll be watching main street on the 10:00 news. 
 Jesus Christ! 
 This was Zobelle. 
 Otto, now Chibs. 
 This guy's trying to break us. 
 All of us. 
 There's gotta be something we can find on this guy. 
 He doesn't make mistakes. 
 I pushed us off retaliation for Otto, but after this, Clay will go at Zobelle full bore. 
 I got a bad feeling we'll be walking right into a trap. 
 Then don't play it out. 
 Not the way this works. 
 Someone hurts us like this, we retaliate. 
 Have to. 
 That's it? You're gonna run blind off the cliff? 
 Maybe not. 
 If I can get to Zobelle first, I can protect the club. 
 What happens when you find him? 
 You tell me. 
 You asking me to help Sam Crow? 
 We both know this guy's got some kind of leverage on you. 
 Think of it as a self-serving favor. 
 I go off the grid and I help you find this guy, you've got to promise that you will hand him over to me alive. 
 What do you do? You can't arrest him. 
 Bring him in as a person of interest, question him up to 24 hours. 
 At least it gives Clay a chance to calm down, maybe you get your crew thinking straight. 
 All right. 
 I get to him first, I give him to you. 
 Do it by the book. 
 I'll dig into the cigar shop records, see if I can find a home address. 
 Pull Weston's info, too. 
 If they're a dead end, we can always rattle Darby. 
 Need some help. 
 What's the matter? 
 Don't know what to do. 
 This thing with Chibs... Gonna push Ope farther away. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Don't come home much anymore. 
 If he does, he barely speaks to his kids. 
 They have no idea what's happening. 
 I didn't sign up for this. 
 Kids need a mother, a father. 
 Tried talking to Ope. 
 I didn't raise him. 
 We got no history. 
 Talk to Piney about it? 
 He's on his way to the cabin. 
 This will be a four-day bender at least. 
 I don't know how to help Ope. 
 Talk to him. 
 Please. 
 All right. 
 I'm gonna head over to St. Thomas. 
 I'll call you as soon as I hear anything. 
 They're waiting for you inside. 
 What? 
 Someone blew up your friend with a car bomb. 
 We don't know what happened. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 We watched it happen. 
 Who the hell would do that? Why would anyone do that? 
 Look, I'm not sure who did it and that's the truth. 
 Probably the same guys who had Otto jumped. 
 Are you in danger? 
 Am I? 
 God. 
 Look, I'm sure nothing's gonna happen. 
 Just gotta be smart, a little more cautious, all right? 
 It's gonna be okay, babe. 
 No, it's not. 
 I have to go deal with this. 
 This explosion... 
 Those the same people who attacked you? 
 And if it was? 
 Maybe if you told somebody about what happened... 
 This isn't on me. 
 Unser's getting us home addresses. 
 You really think Zobelle is sitting in his barcalounge waiting for us to swing by? 
 Why should he hide? 
 The asshole thinks he's protected on every level. 
 He is. 
 Probably riding four-deep. Weston, skinhead crew. 
 Then we ride five-deep. 
 And what's the plan? 
 Roll up on him in broad daylight, cut off his head? 
 You know, I don't give a sh1t what the plan is! 
 I am tired of sittin' here playing "What happens if?" 
 Zobelle tried to kill two of us in the last 12 hours! 
 This charter doesn't wait any longer! We kill him! 
 Do I need to take a vote? 
 You living here now? 
 Crashing once in a while. 
 I talked to your mom. 
 She's worried about her grandkids. 
 Said they never see their dad anymore. 
 It's not your worry. 
 Problem of my brother's is a problem of mine, right? 
 I don't have a problem. 
 My kids are fine. 
 Okay, look, man, I think it's all good you getting deeper in the club, but you're obviously still dealing with some sh1t. 
 Donna's death has got to be a nightmare... 
 How do you know what I'm dealing with? 
 You got to figure out your own sh1t, brother. 
 I know what I'm doing. 
 You got things you want to change. 
 I get it. 
 But this beef with Clay, it's not about what's best for Sam Crow, it's about you... 
 Pushing to be king. 
 It's not your time yet, man. 
 This is Clay's club. 
 You got to back down, get in line. 
 Before somebody gets hurt. 
 Riding through this world All alone God takes your soul You're on your own The crow flies straight A perfect line On the devil's bed Until you die Gotta look this life In the eye. 
 Episode 206: Falx Cerebri This is a crime scene. 
 sh1t. 
  What's this mick b*st*rd doing here? 
 The Irish love a good car bomb. 
 You being here in broad daylight. 
 It's not the smartest move. 
 My dad thought it'd be wise to come find out 
  what all the noise was last night. 
 Accident. 
 Chibs rubbed some wrong wires together. 
 I grew up in South Armagh, boys. 
 Sodium nitrate was a fragrance of my youth. Know it anywhere. 
 We're dealing with the problem. 
 The problem is the feds. 
 This blast will bring them around. 
 It ain't gonna get that far. 
 You tell your old man we got it contained. 
 Sure. 
 I'll let the folks know there's nothing to worry about. 
 Locations of our two white friends. 
 Thanks. 
 How long before Lodi forensics gets out here? 
 It's flagged as a priority. 
 I'm surprised they're not here yet. 
 You may want to send your boys out for donuts. Let us tidy up a little bit. 
 They do look famished. 
 Zobelle rents a house in morada. 
 Had their PD pay a visit. No one's home. 
 Still getting weston's info. 
 Meet me at Darby's. 
 I want you to power scrub the sh1t out of this place. 
 I want it clueless for CSU. 
 Sparkle and shine. 
 Let's go find Zobelle. 
 You need me with you? 
 I'm thinking one of us should be there for Chibs. 
 Yeah, you should go. 
 I'll keep you plugged in. 
 Think he's on board? 
 I don't give a sh1t. 
 He's not. 
 He knows better than to try to stop the retaliation after this, but he's working something else. 
 Just keep an eye on him. 
 Give me a call if you hear anything else. 
 Sure, sir. 
 His truck's not here. 
 His workers saw him last night. 
 Darby told them to be here at 7:00. 
 He's crawled into a hole. 
 I'll put out an ATL. 
 If Darby's in Charming, we'll find him. 
 DC to dispatch. Issue an attempt to locate on ernest Darby... 
 Thought you were at St. Thomas. 
 No news on Chibs yet. 
 Figured maybe Darby could point us to Zobelle. 
 Guess Hale had the same idea? 
 Guess so. 
 Thought you were running down the home addresses. 
 Clay wanted fewer guys. Lower profile. 
 His club. He knows best. 
 Anything here? 
 Dead end. 
 I'll wait for you. 
 We can ride back together. 
 Sure thing. 
 What was that about? 
 It's about sh1t being upside down. 
 Call me with Weston's address. 
 Where you going? 
 Lose my best friend. 
 sh1t. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 This is a crime scene. 
 I'm sorry. I have OCD, and the mess was, like, freaking me out. I... 
 Where's Charming PD? 
 What the hell's going on here?! 
 sh1t, I thought you guys left. 
 Get the hell out of here! It's a goddamn crime scene! 
 Idiot! 
 This your watch? 
 I was taking a piss. 
 I'm sorry. 
 We'll take it from here. 
 sh1t. 
 What are we going to do here? 
 What's this? 
 Cancer drugs. 
 Turns my waste radioactive. 
 I'm holding a cup of your piss? 
 Spill this on the kit. 
 Turns their results into a bad chemistry experiment. 
 Just need to figure a way it don't get me arrested for evidence tampering. 
 Go chat 'em up. 
 And then take my lead. You and your piss. 
 Get you boys anything? 
 A beverage of some sort? 
 We're fine, thanks. 
 What do you think caused this blast anyway? 
 You need to clear out of here. We're still collecting... 
 Look out! 
 Holy sh1t! 
 I am so sorry. Are you guys all right? 
 I thought that they changed out the brake drums. 
 Damn, I'm sorry. 
 You stupid shithead. 
 What the hell is that? 
 Diet cola. 
 Tastes like piss, don't it? 
 Apparently some of our friends in Charming have been looking for me. 
 When we finish here, head to the shop. I suspect they will be coming to you. 
 They're here. 
 This is my daughter, Polly. 
 Cammy Hayes. My boy, Edmond. 
 Glad we finally get to meet in person. 
 Someplace private we can talk? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Why don't you keep me company. 
 You part of all this? 
 That so hard to believe? 
 You just don't look like... 
 I don't know. 
 You don't like the way I look? 
 No... I mean... 
 You look fine, darlin'. 
 Think you already know that. 
 Grab us a couple of beers? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 I followed Jax to Darby's. 
 It was a dead end. But he knew I was tailing him. 
 He lost me at the Corcoran pass. 
 sh1t. 
 There's no one at Zobelle's house. 
 Phones off. Lose the cut. 
 Weston's? 
 Up here around the corner. 
 AJ Weston? Charming Police. 
 Window. 
 I saw it. 
 Stay here. 
 
 
 
 Get out of the way. 
 Go! 
 Jesus Christ. 
 I'm not going to hurt you. 
 I'm just looking for your dad. I'm a friend of his. 
 Let me see the ink! 
 What? 
 Your tats. Prove it! 
 Let's just put the guns down, okay? 
 I got all kinds of ink. 
 It's a kid! 
 Hold your fire! 
 Liar. 
 Where's your dad, shithead? 
 I ain't telling you sh1t, race traitor! 
 Call child services. Have this little psychopath committed. 
 Come on. I ain't afraid of no cop! 
 Shut up. 
 Found his computer. 
 Password protected. Can't get in. 
 Bring it to juice. 
 I guess you're running with hale now. 
 Just working things from my end. Same goal. 
 What's that? 
 Keep the boss happy. 
 Couldn't stop the forensic team. 
 Now what? 
 Guess they ain't open yet. 
 Chibs is stable, but critical. 
 He landed on the back of his head, caused a subdural hematoma. 
 A large blood clot. 
 A brain bleed is severe, but if it subsides, it's not life threatening. 
 All we can do now is monitor it. 
 If it gets worse? 
 They'll have to go in and relieve the pressure. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Cut open his head? 
 Hopefully, it won't come to that. 
 I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't mean... 
 It's okay. 
 It's a shitty day for all of us. 
 You mind if I head home with you? 
 Sure. 
 I'll just finish up a few things. 
 I'll wait for you downstairs. 
 Thanks. 
 How's Chibs? 
 Critical. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You got a minute? 
 For what? 
 I've... 
 Kind of hit a wall trying to find who did this. 
 I was hoping you could help. 
 Me? 
 I don't know anything more than the guys do. 
 Unser told me some things. 
 About you. 
 And what happened. At least what he knows. 
 Piece of sh1t. 
 He had to. 
 Shut up! 
 We both know this thing with Chibs was Zobelle. 
 Give me something, Any detail, anything you can remember. 
 It never goes on record. 
 The secret keeps. Just... point me somewhere. 
 Why are you suddenly so interested in helping us? 
 I became a cop, doesn't mean I don't give a sh1t about folks I grew up with. 
 You want to hurt this guy. 
 I do. 
 Girl in her 20s, cute, blonde... 
 Good rack. 
 She's the only one I saw. 
 Thank you. 
 And I am sorry... 
 You or your cancerous boss tell anyone else what happened to me, and I will cut both of your big, soft hearts out. 
 Copy that. 
 He's pissed. 
 What the hell is this? 
 Where you headed? 
 What do you care? 
 {\And w}What {\the hell'}is he doing with you? 
 You on their payroll now, too? 
 Just answer the question. 
 I'm going to see my mom. She's sick. 
 Your mother died last month. 
 My other mother. 
 All right, where's Zobelle? 
 How do I know? What, is this about the blast last night? 
 What do you think? If Zobelle did have something to do with it, Nords knew nothing about it. 
 Unlike Sam Crow, we don't blow up sh1t in our own town. 
 Don't show up for work this morning. Now you're heading out of town. 
 You running from something? 
 I got a heads up that sh1t might go down. 
 No other details. 
 I'm on my way to Vegas. 
 That's it. 
 That's the truth. 
 You know anything about a blond,  
 20s, good tits? 
 Sounds like Zobelle's daughter. 
 I've seen her hang with Weston. 
 Can I go? 
 Thanks. 
 Dicks. 
 Where did you get the intel on the girl? 
 Description turned up when we canvassed the street minivan was towed from. 
 You still have the one I gave you? 
 I got rid of it after Kohn left. 
 Wait here. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Do you and clay really need this many guns? 
 These are just mine. 
 Here. 
 See how this feels. 
 It's okay. It's not too heavy. 
 .38. 
 That'll blow a good hole. 
 What's this for? 
 Let's go. 
 Where? 
 Squeeze slowly. 
 It'll have some kick. 
 You're gripping too hard. 
 You want to hold it firm, but let it breathe. 
 All right. 
 Now, put the sight on what you want dead, then take a breath. 
 And... 
 Good. 
 Is it always like this? 
 You came back to him at a bad time. 
 It settles down. 
 It gets downright boring, I promise. 
 That was fun. 
 You're gonna love this. 
 Some mess. 
 I've already filed a report. 
 I know. 
 We'll look into that. 
 I'm sure you will. 
 You must be Ethan Zobelle's daughter. 
 Polly. 
 I'm the deputy chief. 
 I know. 
 I'm looking for your dad. 
 Haven't seen him. 
 Why don't you give him a call. 
 It's important I connect with him. 
 I'm not his keeper. 
 He's wanted for questioning. 
 And if you're lying to me, that means you're interfering with a criminal investigation. 
 What do I look like, one of your inbred natives? 
 Come on, charge me or get out. 
 I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. 
 I slice open my arm, I charge you with aggravated assault on a peace officer. 
 My old man was a judge. You'll do a three-year pop at the Sanwa dyke lodge, no questions asked. 
 There's a big rally at the Christian Center in Morada. 
 The league? 
 Weston's rowdy crowd. 
 Prison muscle. 
 Daddy's giving his reformer speech. Tends to work 'em up. 
 I need you to come with me. 
 Why? I told you the truth. 
 That truth needs to stay between us. 
 Going to keep that from your daddy for awhile. 
 Station house. 
 Zobelle is at the Christian center in Morada. 
 Big aryan membership rally tonight. 
 Can Morada PD pick him up? 
 It's Weston's prison crew. It could get ugly. Better off sending the sheriffs. 
 How's Chibs doing? 
 The bleeding stopped. He's still critical, but if it holds, he'll be out of the woods. 
 That's great. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry about all this. 
 I'm telling you as much as I know. 
 It's okay. 
 It'll ease up. 
 It will. 
 I got a call from Luann. 
 Apparently there was some kind of firearm incident out at Caracara. 
 No kidding? 
 I love you. 
 You should. 
 Checked his house and the cigar shop again. 
 Still off the map. Zobelle knows we're looking for him. 
 Asshole has to surface. 
 And we won't be able to do sh1t. 
 The feds are on their way. 
 We're gonna be ass deep in some bad suits by morning. 
 sh1t. 
 I think we got something. 
 There's an appointment in Weston's calendar for tonight. 
 He tagged it "EZ, MCC." 
 Morada Christian Center. 
 Off Alhambra. 
 What's going on? 
 They think they know where Zobelle is. 
 Christian Center, Morada. 
 sh1t. 
 I understand you had a new partner today. 
 Just trying to contain this. 
 So much for that plan. 
 There's something I need to tell you. 
 You girls swapping diaries again? Huh? 
 I needed some information. 
 sh1t. 
 You have no idea. 
 Come on. 
 I'd prefer the feds didn't see the beating I'm about to take. 
 When are the sheriffs coming? 
 I called them. I'm not sure. Why? 
 I had to tell Hale. 
 He was getting seduced by Zobelle's 
 "I'm good for Charming" bullshit. 
 I'm sorry. 
 The thing that happened to Chibs, it was definitely Zobelle? 
 Can't prove sh1t, but I know it in my gut. 
 We all do. 
 Nothing I know could have stopped that blast. 
 Clay taking on what happened to me would have... Would have made it worse. 
 That's right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This ain't on you, sweetheart. 
 I'm start... 
 I'm starting to think that... 
 It's all on me. 
 I know. 
 Couple buses out front, a few cars in the lot, Zobelle's Mercedes. 
 Two ab guys out front. 
 There's a side door. 
 It'll be easy. 
 Good. 
 What, we kick in the doors, grab Zobelle? 
 We do it in front of an audience? 
 Come on, it's Weston's crew. 
 It's a handful of ex-cons and scumbags. 
 Not really reliable witnesses. 
 We'll let them make the first move. 
 It's more than a handful. 
 It's a membership rally. It's going to be packed with ab. 
 How the hell do you know that? 
 Hale grilled Zobelle's daughter. 
 He's sending sheriffs to pick him up for questioning. 
 We got cops on the way? 
 Then, we better hurry. 
 Anything else you want to tell us? 
 We do this, we all go to jail. 
 AKs and shotguns. Let's go. 
 Keep your mouth shut. 
 Give me that. 
 Ready? 
 We're set. 
 Five count. 
 One, two... 
 What the hell, man? 
 Got him. 
 We got to get the hell out of here. Out now! 
 Now! 
 sh1t. 
 Call it in. 
 Drop the guns, now! 
 Drop 'em, now! 
 Holy sh1t.
