 That look straight to you? 
 Kinda. 
 Well, you can test-drive it after school today if your dad says it's okay. 
 Hey, Dad? Can I help Topper after school? 
 Dad : I'm with a customer. Give me a second, I'll be right in. 
 Hey, um... 
 Can you do me a favor? 
 Just drop this in a mailbox for me somewhere, okay? 
 'Kay. 
 Uncle Top? 
 Do you think I'll ever get to meet her? 
 I hope so. 
 She'd really like you.

 Yeah.

 Okay. Have a great day, buddy. 
 All right. 
 You got two PB and J's in there.

 Okay. Bye, Dad. 
 You know, you could ride with him to school someday. It's just a couple blocks. 
 I would if I could. 
 Someday soon, I hope. 
 See you later, little brother.

 Well, um, the mailbox that you've got, um, it hasn't been in use since 1997. 
 And then that pin that Oliver is wearing, it was discontinued in 2014. 
 And in 1848, the postal service...

 I'm Norman Dorman. 
 I'm a student of U.S. postal history. 
 Well, that's very impressive, Norman, but we're on a deadline, and that ship has sailed. 
 W... during the Mongol empire, Kublai Khan used more than 6,000 ships to deliver mail. 
 Most of it said things like, "we're coming to kill you." 
 You know... 
 We got an opening for a guy like you in DC. 
 Public relations is looking for a communications liaison in the office of postal heritage. 
 Are you interested? 
 Well, um... 
 Why don't you think about it and give me a call?

 I think he just offered me a job. 
 Oh! 
 Here we go! 
 Okay. 
 Ready, Mr. O'Toole? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Director : Okay. Ready, and... 
 Action! 
 I'm Oliver O'Toole, and I've worked for the United States postal service for 17 years. 
 And I'm Joseph O'Toole, and I worked for the post office for 22 years, and my father worked for the post office for 50 years, just like my grandfather. 
 There's been an O'Toole proudly delivering mail since 1789. 
 Joe : Through rain and sleet and snow and dark of night, no matter how far, no matter how tough, if you want it there, we know how to get it there. 
 The U.S. postal service... 
 A grand tradition. 
 Director : And...

 That's a wrap, folks! 
 Nice job. 
 Thank you.

 That was fun. 
 Hmm. 
 We should do more stuff together. 
 Preferably without, uh, make-up.

 You know, I've been doing a lot of backpacking recently. 
 I thought maybe I'd hit the El Dorado Canyon this weekend. You interested? 
 Oh, uh, this weekend? 
 Yeah, I know you're not a big nature guy, but, hey, every couple of decades, we should do a little bonding time, huh? 
 Oh, I did recently read an article about father-son bonding benefits, but this weekend I have a date.

 Wow!

 Good for you. 
 Well, some other time, then. 
 Absolutely.

 Um, a bunch of us are going to Mailbox Grille for lunch. 
 Would you like to come? 
 Sure. 
 Meet you there. 
 Mister? 
 Excuse me? 
 Hey! 
 Is it true? 
 Is what true? 
 The post office can deliver anything? 
 Well, if they can't, nobody can. 
 Even if you get peanut butter and jelly all over it and you drop it in the street and a car runs over it, and it gets ripped up in your bike chain?

 Rita : I just can't believe it. 
 It was so sudden. 
 Well, Eleanor was always surprising us. 
 Yeah. Remember last year's Halloween party, when she went as Charles Lindbergh delivering the mail to Paris? 
 And she was a loyal government servant. 
 Postal to the end. 
 Director : Norman! You got a second? 
 I'm gonna go get us a table. 
 Okay. 
 Bobby found this in that prop mailbox we were using this morning. 
 It's definitely not one of ours. 
 I figured you would know what to do with it. 
 Somebody must've thought it was a real mailbox. 
 Uh, Las Vegas... 
 N-e... v? Rita? 
 Oh, well, there are only two Nevada zip codes that end in 01, and only one in the Las Vegas area. 
 You want something memorized, she's your girl. 
 Actually, she's my girl. 
 Oh! 
 Anyways, um, this envelope's been reused, so maybe we can pull up a latent address, or trace the manufacturer of whatever's inside... 
 Looks like it's an American-made t-shirt. 
 I gotta say, Norm. 
 You're being wasted out here in Denver. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 Yes, you do. 
 You're good and you know it. 
 You're just too humble. You still got my card? 
 Yes, but... 
 Call me. 
 Think big! 
 Be bold! 
 Wait. Does that mean that I'm not bold? 
 I think I'm bold. Am I bold? 
 Oh. Bold? 
 Uh, well... 
 Oh, look! Shrimp! 
 Just imagining Denver branch without Eleanor... 
 We just never know, do we? 
 When your mother left us, I never imagined that I wouldn't... 
 That we wouldn't all see her again someday. 
 But she got sick, and then she was gone. 
 When I got the news that she'd died, I went up in the mountains to watch a sunset... 
 And then I just sat there in the dark for hours until I could find a reason to believe that the sunrise was worth waiting for. 
 What did you find? 
 I decided that... 
 If I could just wake up every morning... 
 You'd be there. 
 [Footsteps] 
 Ahem. Do you mind if I join you? 
 Please! 
 We're just having one of those meaning-of-life conversations. 
 Seems like the right day for it. 
 Mm. 
 Did Oliver ever tell you his "divine delivery theory"? 
 Hmm! 
 I didn't know I had one. 
 Well, you know, the "we don't find the dead letters, they find us... Just in time to be delivered." 
 I call it "Oliver's divine delivery theory." 
 You guys believe every letter that "finds you" is on some supernatural schedule? 
 Yes. 
 Well, some of us believe, and... 
 Some of us are open to it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Huh! Well, let's... 
 Let's test your theory. 
 You prove to me that the next dead letter you come across actually makes some kind of miraculous difference in the world, and if you can't, then you have to let me take you camping before summer's over. 
 And if you can prove some providential postal theory... 
 Then I'll pick up your dinner tab at Montaldo's. 
 Deal? 
 I'm not really comfortable wagering the ability of the almighty to... 
 If the almighty is everything that you say that he is, then I think he can handle it. 
 [Sighs tentatively] 
 Deal! 
 Gotta run. 
 And I'm sorry about your friend. 
 Camping?You? 
 He invited me to bond with him this weekend. 
 I told him I had other plans. 
 Yes, you do. 
 And you told him we're going back to Montaldo's? 
 Well, our first attempt at dinner was a rather challenging evening, so returning might allow us to... 
 To... 
 Get back up on the horse. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oliver, for someone who believes in miracles, sometimes you can be so... 
 Practical. 
 [Proudly]: Ah! 
 [Laughs] 
 Oliver : All right, Norman. 
 Would you walk us through this, please? 
 Ah. Well... 
 Envelope damaged by tire-tread trauma, peanut butter, and some sort of grease. 
 Hmm... [sniffs] 
 Bicycle chain, I believe. 
 The zip code suggests it's from the northeast corner of Las Vegas. 
 And a men's stinky t-shirt and a two-page letter which we haven't read, in compliance, of course, with postal privacy code 10-01P. 
 "Assume nothing." Hmm! That's good advice. 
 What are we assuming? 
 I don't know about you guys, but... 
 This day's been hard enough without trying to start an impossible project too. 
 Well... 
 Nothing's impossible. 
 That's a bold statement, Norman. 
 Um... yes, and allow me to be a little bolder. 
 Something like this dropping in our laps on a day like today might seem like bad timing, but... 
 We can't assume anything. 
 It's a... Sort of a... 
 Divine delivery, perhaps. 
 Okay. 
 But if we're gonna do this, I say we forget protocol, forget privacy code 10-01P, and we read the letter and let the miracles begin. 
 Well, unless... 
 You would rather go camping instead. 
 Camping? 
 Oliver doesn't like to live outside. 
 Not on purpose, anyway! [Laughs] 
 Hmm. 
 All right. 
 "Watching the sunset, sitting in front of the fire, listening to guitar music..." 
 Oh, dear. 
 It's a bucket list. 
 Wonder if Eleanor had a bucket list. 
 Do you? 
 No. Of course, I do have a list of buckets. 
 Well... 
 Except for the part about eating Mexican food, Mmm! 
 It's not very creative. 
 There's nothing about mount Everest or about riding in a balloon over Stockholm. 
 [Inhales abruptly] 
 [Self-conscious chuckle] 
 People make bucket lists all the time. 
 Uh, yes. Not for other people. 
 Unless... 
 "Hi. It's me again, and I know you're probably getting tired of hearing from me, but I promise this time I'm not asking for anything for myself. 
 I just want to help Sandy. 
 I'd do anything to be with her now. 
 I truly believe if we could be together, I could help her, maybe even save her life... 
 But I guess that's not going to happen." 
 Topper : "So I'm just hoping that you'll do everything you can to save her. And if it's too late, then I hope you'll do everything you can to make her comfortable. If I could hold her one more time and tell her that I love her, I would, but I'm still not 100% myself, so I'm enclosing kind of a bucket list for Sandy. A few ideas maybe you could do that might remind her of me. And I sent her my favorite t-shirt. She was always stealing it. Funny how the little things are what we remember. 
 I know you have to do what you have to do, and I don't blame you. 
 Just... please just promise me that if she isn't going to make it, don't let her be alone when she..." 
 The, uh... 
 The last part is missing. 
 It's a letter like this on a day like today that makes our work seem... 
 Like a calling. 
 Say what you will about magic letters, Ms. McInerney... 
 Whoever wrote this... 
 Is trying to say goodbye before it's too late, and... 
 We are their only chance to make that happen. 
 Of course. 
 Of course we are. 
 We'll get this delivered as soon as possible. 
 But we don't have an address or even a return address. 
 All we have is the corner that it was mailed from... 
 Well, sort of mailed from. 
 Maybe we could canvass the area. 
 Oh, that could take days. 
 Well, there are 734 small businesses in the University Hills area that it could've been mailed from and Norman and I could cover it if we did, oh... 
 185 each for two days. 
 Good. 
 Uh, Ms. McInerney... 
 I can hack into the t-shirt manufacturer for points of purchase. 
 If I can lift a partial print from this, maybe your friend at the state division of investigations could run it for us. 
 Yes. Dale might do us a favor. 
 Do you want me to find her number for you? 
 No, thank you. I actually know it. 
 [Starts dialing] 
 I am going to continue to analyze the letter for a connection to Las Vegas. 
 We should all pray that, uh... 
 Well, I'm going to pray for Sandy, whoever she is, that she can hang on until we reach her. 
 Hi, this is...

 You said you didn't spend much time outside. 
 I don't. 
 I used to when I was little, though, didn't I? 
 Yeah! 
 Anyway, you bought me a record album once. 
 "Bird songs of the rocky mountains." 
 I remember. 
 You still have that? 
 I do.

 Oh, no way! 
 No, this is all part of the experience.

 All right. 
 Norman : People think New Mexico is just a big desert, but 25% of it is covered by forest. 
 Oh! I didn't know that, Norman. 
 I did. I know a lot of stuff. 
 I just don't know what to do with it. 
 Have you been thinking about taking that job in Washington? 
 I've been thinking about what that director said about thinking big. It's easy to be bold about the little stuff. 
 The biggest thing you ever did was when you didn't think at all, Norman. 
 It was the first time you kissed me. 
 Man : Enjoy your stay at the Prairie Dog Motel. 
 There's a rock collector's convention going on. 
 I got the last room. 
 Well, rooms. 
 Opposite ends of the Prairie Dog.

 Shane tells me you've got a letter that isn't looking very, uh, what is it? 
 Uh... 
 "Providential." 
 [Laughs] 
 Does this mean you're admitting defeat? 
 Absolutely not. Something tells me that letter is on its own timetable. 
 Believe it or not, they found it in that prop mailbox we were using for the commercial the other day. 
 Ripped and mangled envelope, covered in peanut butter, bicycle grease... 
 Been run over by a car? 
 Yes? 
 It was a kid! 
 He asked me if we could deliver anything, even if it was totally wrecked. 
 It had to be him! 
 Well, the little kid wouldn't realize it wasn't a real mailbox. 
 He rode a bike. 
 He had on a cap. 
 It was one of those team baseball caps. 
 It said... 
 "Kennedy... 
 Celtics." 
 Well, we could track him down through the team. 
 I need to call Shane. 
 You could use my cell phone, but I busted it in the fall.

 I just... 
 Want to get you to the doctor before it gets any worse. 
 Well, the trailhead should be right over...

 I just need to sit a second. 
 Oh, yeah. Sure. 
 It's a good thing we're almost there. 
 Oh, man. 
 So I need to, uh, make a confession. 
 Okay. 
 Yesterday you asked me if you'd ever been in these woods before. 
 And you have. 
 When? 
 You were about seven or eight, and you kept begging your mom and me to take you hiking in the mountains. 
 So we did, and you loved it. 
 You-you loved the freedom and the-the birds... 
 Kept running out ahead of us to protect us from the bears. 
 Huh! 
 And then you ran out so far ahead that we lost you. 
 And we started calling out, and things got scary and we panicked, and she blamed me and I blamed her, and, well... 
 We got in a fight. 
 Not our first one. 
 But something about being alone out in the forest made it seem so much more raw and bitter than it had ever been before, like there was nothing civilized there to make us hold back, and we said some awful stuff. 
 And then we looked around, and... 
 And there you were, standing there, watching us, absolutely broken-hearted. 
 I could never get you to come back to the mountains after that. 
 You were so afraid that your mom and I would start fighting again. 
 You were always trying to protect us from the bears. 
 You even asked me if there was a way for you to go to the forest without actually going to the forest, so, I, well... 
 [Chuckles] 
 That's why you got me "bird songs of the rocky mountains?" 
 It was that or an evergreen air freshener. 
 [Both chuckling] 
 [Groaning] 
 Your mother left us a few weeks later. 
 It wasn't my fault, and it definitely wasn't yours. 
 But I think... 
 All these years that little boy deep down inside of you has believed it was... 
 And you've lost a lot of time and you've missed a lot of love. 
 And look how long it took you to come back to the forest. 
 Don't wait for the pain to go away, Ollie. 
 Just... 
 Just leave it here on the mountain.

 And here we go. 
 And here we go. 
 Norman? 
 I was just thinking. 
 If I call that man who gave me his card and-and if he offers me that dream job in D.C. 
 And if I say yes... 
 Well, this could be the last dead letter that I ever deliver. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well... 
 Then you should be very proud, because that letter is going to make a real difference for someone.

 Norman : This letter made it seem like... 
 She didn't have much time. 
 Well, she was in trouble there for a while. 
 Topper was right to worry. 
 I'm confused. Who does she belong to? 
 Sandy's a contract working dog. 
 She does the same job as a combat dog, only she's owned by a company that contracts with the military to send K9 units into war zones. 
 The handlers we train are usually former army or marines, like Topper. 
 This is his t-shirt. 
 So Topper wrote the letter? 
 He's written a few. 
 So were they partners? 
 The best K9 team we ever trained. 
 They attached to 16 different support operations, and they did incredibly dangerous work, searching for explosives and people who make them. 
 I read once that if you had two million apples, a dog could smell out one rotten one. 
 Well, let's just say she found a lot of rotten apples in Afghanistan. 
 [Chuckling] 
 Until... 
 Something happened? 
 Sandy was getting close to uncovering something, and somebody tossed a grenade in the embassy. 
 They both survived, but they both came back with PTSD. 
 Why aren't they together now? 
 It sounds harsh, but Sandy wasn't Topper's pet. 
 I've never saw a dog and a man that loved each other so much, but Topper was an employee of that company, and Sandy is, well... 
 Considered equipment. 
 Ohh. They should be together. 
 You never forget your partner, and, well, look... 
 Sandy's never forgotten her best friend, but from that letter, it sounds like Topper wasn't getting better. 
 Sandy would be able to make him better. 
 Probably. 
 But... 
 Well, the only way he could have her would be to buy her from the company. 
 And Topper wanted to, but he just doesn't have that kind of money.
