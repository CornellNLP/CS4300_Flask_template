 Hey! Hold on! 
 Whoa. Just in time, huh? 
 Just in time. 
 Wait! 
 I'm sorry, I'm just... 
 You know that feeling when you're about to drop a letter in the box, and then you freeze, and then that weird voice in your head yells "wait!" 
 But what am I waiting for? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, I'm not a kid anymore, right? 
 And I can't wait forever. 
 Neither can I. 
 Sorry. 
 I just don't write a lot of letters. 
 See, it's like ripping off a bandage, you just gotta do it fast and scream, right? 
 Don't scream. 
 [Light chuckle] 
 Okay. 
 What good is a letter if you don't mail it? 
 Okay. 
 Here goes! 
 Okay. Bye.

 Happy Monday, Oliver. 
 Oliver : Anything pressing? 
 Uh, no. Just the usual. 
 Except for this. 
 Oh... 
 [Sniffing] 
 Hmm. 
 Pine tar... 
 And evergreen. 
 The Florida Yew, I believe? 
 Oh! The Florida Yew only grows in northern Florida, on the eastern side of the Apalachicola River. 
 Sadly, we will never know that story. 
 Norman, will you dispatch to the Miami branch? 
 You got it. 
 Oh! I might stop by passports. 
 Eleanor got a new blender and she's making smoothies. 
 Does anybody want one? 
 Ooh. Yes, please.

 O.P.S, what's all about? 
 We shall see. 
 So, what happened with your date Saturday night? 
 Did you wear the pink dress? 
 Yes. 
 And?  What happened at the end? Did he kiss you? 
 Well... 
 Well, something happened, 'cause he is drinking smoothies, and he almost called you Shane. 
 No, he didn't. 
 Yes, he did. He said, ahem... 
 (As Oliver): "Good morning, uh, sh... 
 Ms. Mcinerney." 
 There was no "sh..." 
 I didn't hear a "sh." 
 Announcement :  Shane Mcinerney to the front desk. Shane Mcinerney. 
 What is going on today? 
 Shane! 
 Do I...? 
 It's Nikki. Your server from Saturday night. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Uh-huh. 
 That's right. A duck. 
 And a can of beans! 
 Beans. 
 Never seen anything like it. 
 Uh-huh. Yeah. 
 Yeah. He just arrived. 
 Got it. 
 [Hangs up] 
 O'Toole. 
 Mr.  Kimsicle. 
 Glad to have you aboard. 
 We need a man who knows the ropes... 
 The sails, the lay of the land, the whole enchilada, from stem to stern. 
 Could you... Elaborate? 
 Now, that is what I mean. 
 We need a smart guy around here who knows about elaborating. 
 Oh. 
 Four days ago, an unidentified perpetrator removed the mail from this mailbox and replaced it with a duck. 
 Uh, I believe that may be a goose. 
 You're thinking already. 
 I like that. 
 [Sniffs] Three days ago, the mail was taken from here and replaced with two tiny people in a tent. 
 So, a wedding cake topper, a goose, and may I assume a third mailbox yielded a can of kidney beans? 
 Ah, yes, you may. 
 And you may also assume that you and that weird little task force of yours are going to find this guy. 
 I'm not quite sure this falls under the aegis of the dead letter office. 
 Perhaps the police or F.B.I... 
 O'Toole! 
 If word gets out before we know what we're dealing with, we could have rampant hysteria running all over the place. 
 We need to keep this in-house as long as we can. 
 Has anyone dusted the beans for fingerprints? 
 That little guy in your office, with the suitcase, doesn't he usually do that? 
 Yes, but... 
 And the other two, the skinny one and that "Shane" gal. 
 Ms. Mcinerney. 
 Oh, she is a live-wire. 
 Nothin' gets past her, huh? 
 Not that I'm aware of. 
 So there are no other leads? 
 Oh, just one. 
 Yeah, this was found Saturday in box 458. 
 It's some kind of fancy language, like Greek or Peruvian. 
 It's Latin. 
 Or Latin. 
 I'm guessing that is a clue of massive proportions. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, it's definitely a clue. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I love this guy! 
 One more day. 
 If I had just waited one more day and thought it through, but no, I had to send it. 
 I had to say it... 
 "Let's get married." 
 Then I give it to the mailman and, for a few hours, I actually feel, you know... hope. 
 Until... 
 Oh, god, if he gets it now, I'll be utterly humiliated, or worse... Mortified. 
 Or... 
 What's worse... Mortified or pitied? 
 Nikki, getting a letter back once it's mailed is almost impossible. 
 Then that's it. 
 Listen. 
 Fill this out, then have them come get me. 
 I'll walk this onto the floor and I'll look for it myself. 
 Hey! Everything okay? 
 Yeah. Strange, though. 
 It was our waitress from Montaldo's. 
 She needed a form 10-67e. 
 So tell me about that dinner! 
 Well, let's see. 
 Start from the beginning. 
 He was really nervous at first. 
 And then we started dancing and things got better, until... 
 Until...? 
 Until we stopped dancing.

 Oliver : "The water is wide, I cannot cross o'er, and neither have I the wings to fly..." 
 "Give us a boat that can carry two and both shall row to yonder side." 
 I've never heard "to yonder side." 
 Isn't it "and both shall row, my love and I"? 
 It's, uh, an archaic tune. 
 Traditional lyrics often evolve over time. 
 I just chose an alternate translation. 
 Huh. 
 [Diners applauding as song ends] 
 Shall we? 
 Thank you. 
 I see you're enjoying the champagne? 
 Oh, yes, it's amazing. 
 The service here is excellent. 
 You haven't seen anything yet. Just wait for the show. 
 By the way, do either of you have any food sensitivities? 
 No, we don't. 
 Good. 
 We have an  Amuse Bouche  for you this evening... 
 A shrimp-and-sashimi crouton, compliments of the chef. 
 "Amuse Bouche." 
 A millennial phenomenon. 
 [Chuckling] 
 A what? 
 Oh, he just means that people weren't having their... 
 "Bouches" amused back in the 20th century. 
 [Both chuckling] 
 I knew it. 
 I'm sorry? 
 My boyfriend works here, too, and he was sure you guys were on your first date, but I said no way. 
 I mean, with the champagne, the way you dance, and talk about each other, the way you even know each other's allergies, it's got to be your anniversary, right? 
 No, actually, we're just friends. 
 Uh, of course, "just" is a rather imprecise qualifier. 
 Perhaps a more accurate... 
 Did you say something about a show? 
 Ah, right! What's Montaldo's without the singing waiters? 
 Any requests? 
 Yes, uh... How soon can you start singing? 
 Oh, what do know? That's our cue! 
 [Crunching loudly] 
 He really said that? "Just friends"? 
 Yep! Rolled right off his tongue, like he was asking for more butter. 
 Ouch. 
 Oh, it gets worse. 
 You know, uh, ahem, I actually do have an allergy... 
 A slight sensitivity to Rosehip tea, but I don't expect you to know that. 
 I'll keep that in mind. 
 No Rosehips. 
 It's always good to learn something new about a friend. 
 Speaking of roses, did you ever plant that cutting from your mother's rosebush? 
 Oh, you mean the one that you so thoughtfully gave me when we all went back east? 
 Yes. 
 It never really took. 
 I think it died. 
 Oh, that's a shame. 
 I know. I know. I... 
 I tried everything to keep it alive. 
 I watered it, I fed it, I talked to it. 
 Sharply : I fertilized it. 
 Oh. 
 You know they say the best fertilizer... 
 What? 
 Uh, some botanists have noted that roses tend to thrive when located near the final resting place of a family pet... [Trails off] 
 You think I should plant a dead animal under my rosebush? 
 Well, only if you had one. 
 [Astonished chuckle] 
 A pet sounds pretty good right now.

 We have been charged with the grim task of investigating the systematic and, frankly, bizarre plundering of the United States mail from official receptacles in south Denver. 
 Wow.

 It does happen, I'm afraid. 
 Not like this. 
 This time it's personal.

 They are words of encouragement to a shipwrecked army. 
 What does being shipwrecked have to do with the post office? 
 Ah. Courage and perseverance, Norman. 
 Hallmarks of every postal worker who's performed his or her duty in the face of great odds and received one of these.

 Beans, wedding cakes, and a... duck?

 Well, all we need is a partial print, and that might be enough to run through a database. 
 Too bad we don't have one. 
 Ms. Mcinerney? 
 Well, it's not impossible to break into the FBI fingerprint system, but it could take some time... 
 Like 30 years to life. 
 Are you sure we can't just call the police? 
 Well, Lester was adamant. 
 He isn't easy to say no to. 
 Nothing. 
 This has been wiped clean. 
 This guy knows what he's doing. 
 We need someone from law enforcement who can give us a psychological profile of the sort of person we're dealing with here. 
 We need, uh, well, we need...

 Yes. 
 Oh, who's he? 
 Dale is a she. 
 Dale sings in a choir at Oliver's church. 
 Dale is lovely. 
 Wait. You went to Oliver's church? 
 Mm-hmm. Just to drop something off. 
 He introduced me. 
 She's a soprano. 
 And a police officer. 
 Well, to be accurate, she was a police officer. 
 She's now a special agent for the state division of investigations.

 Yes, she does.

 Probably. He seemed sort of... sad. 
 What's this about? 
 Well, the good news is, the mail you're trying to retrieve has not yet been delivered, because it's not yet entered the system. 
 The unfortunate news is we believe that mail has been involved in a series of unauthorized transfers. 
 What? 
 Somebody stole a bunch of mail. 
 Well, you've gotta get mine back!

 But what if the mail guy does? 
 [Nikki sighs] 
 I should never have mailed that letter. 
 And I wouldn't have, if it weren't for him! 
 What do you mean? 
 Oh, he said something about "what good is a letter if you never mail it?"

 Look, you were in love and you took a risk to say so. 
 You put yourself out there. 
 But now the letter is out there... 
 I have to get it back. 
 I have to! 
 Well, seeing as you've completed form 67E, as soon as the mail is recovered, we will be certain to return it to you. 
 In the meantime, I'd like you to go with Norman to assist in creating a sketch of our suspect.

 Dale : Well, he's educated. 
 You don't get a lot of ransom notes in Latin. 
 But you don't want to make a formal report? 
 Well, for now, I was hoping we might have a rhetorical conversation about the sort of person who might do this. 
 Okay, well, from what I can tell, this rhetorical person probably works for the post office. 
 Oliver figured that out right away, and we have a description from someone who handed our suspect the letter on Saturday night. 
 Male, gray hair, probably over 60 years old, and he said something to our witness like, uh, "what good is a letter if you don't mail it?" 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, that sounds like a philosopher who's tired of dreaming. 
 He wants something, he knows you want the mail back, so he's keeping it hostage. 
 You think he might be dangerous? 
 It's possible. 
 Oh, dear. 
 So we're looking for postal carriers that are over 60 and depressed? 
 [Chuckles] Well, that should narrow it down. 
 You've got a little more to go on than that. 
 You have a cake-topper, some beans, and... 
 What is this? A goose? 
 Yes. 
 Hmm. Remember, this isn't about the mail. 
 He's playing a game. 
 He's not just sending this to anybody at the post office. 
 He wants somebody in particular to figure this out, and he wants to prove that he's just as smart as they are. 
 So, he knows them? 
 Oh, yes. And he hates them. 
 So, if we don't figure out the game, he's just gonna keep stealing mail and leaving weird stuff behind? 
 I don't think so. 
 You see, the Latin quotation is different from the other clues. 
 This literally says "remember  this,"  but... 
 But... 
 There's an alternate translation. 
 Yes! 
 "Perhaps someday it will be good to remember these things." 
 These things! 
 Right. 
 Does the post office keep a record of the people that have won the dark of night award? 
 I ran a search of the list on the way over here, and I filtered for ducks, geese, cake decorations, kidney beans, beans, you name it, and all I got was a hundred years of recipients and dates. 
 Oh, and a very nice article about us here, Oliver, when we got ours. 
 Oh. 
 You never mentioned that. 
 Oh, well, it was a bit of a miracle, frankly. 
 [Oliver and Dale chuckle] 
 Oliver... 
 What did your grandfather receive his dark of night award for? 
 He gave up Christmas Eve with his family to stay in the terminal annex to help a damaged shipment of... 
 Of  goose eggs  hatch overnight! 
 And the kidney beans? 
 Why kidney beans, why not pinto or Lima? 
 Because you and I and Norman and Rita helped a girl who needed...

 But, um, I suppose you know that, being so familiar with the place. 
 Oliver, Lester is an idiot. 
 And Steve... 
 I have been over him for a very long time. 
 You owe me no explanations, Ms. Mcinerney. 
 Because you and I are just... friends? 
 That was an unfortunate turn of phrase, I'm afraid. 
 So... [sighs] 
 So what was tonight? 
 Was it a date? 
 Or was it just our "long-promised dinner"? 
 I don't know. 
 It was supposed to be a quiet dinner with good company and good conversation, and I did want it to be someplace special... 
 And I wanted to dance. 
 Oliver, I never danced with any of the others here. 
 I only... 
 I only dance with you. 
 We could use more practice. 
 I-I know. 
 If we we're gonna get any good at it. 
 I imagine we could be very good. 
 I imagine we would be. 
 If we practiced every week. 
 Every week? 
 Oh, I only meant if you were serious... 
 I-I mean... 
 Right. 
 [Piano begins to play] 
 Right. 
 Host :  And now, returning to the stage with a very special goodnight from Montaldo's... Please welcome Michael and Sophia.

 Oliver, are we dancing? 
 No, Ms. Mcinerney. We are not. 
 Okay. 
 Oliver : I need to ask you something. 
 I liked that dessert. 
 It was very good. 
 I'm glad to hear it. 
 It's hard to find a good curd these days. 
 Yes. Times have changed. 
 And I'm very old-fashioned, you know. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 And when life becomes complicated, one finds oneself falling back upon the traditional and familiar. 
 One takes one's time to avoid the risk of precipitousness. 
 Does one get to the question? 
 And yet... 
 What good is a letter if one never mails it? 
 Is that the question? 
 No. Why did you order lemon cake for the party today? 
 Um... 
 I thought you should have a second chance to try it. 
 And you couldn't wait until the next time we went to Montaldo's? 
 Or did you assume there would be no "next time"? 
 Well, I... 
 Well... 
 It may surprise you, but I believe in second chances, too. 
 Okay. 
 Shall I should put it on the calendar, then, for sometime this year? 
 Yes. How does next Saturday sound? 
 Great. 
 It's a date. 
 I mean, it's a... 
 It is a date. 
 Speaking of second chances... 
 Mm-hmm? 
 How do you like my hair? 
 What? 
 Do you like my hair? 
 It's fine. Uh, it's, uh, very... 
 I like the flower. 
 Good. 
 Ahem. 
 It's the first rose of summer. 
 No! 
 It took after all. 
 And no animals were harmed in the blooming of this rose. 
 [Laughing] 
 And... and you'd given up. 
 I know. 
 Oh, me of little Faith. 
 All it takes is a little. 
 Come on!
