 Man : Ah. Okay. Come closer, come closer. Right there. That looks great. Perfect. 
 And happiness. 
 Can Rodrigo's eyes come out to play? 
 No. No, they'll stay in. 
 Ah. Okay, the glasses stay on. 
 Uh, Hendrik, get the maestro a baton. 
 Thank you. 
 Happiness. That... That uh... That looks great. 
 You ever held one of those before? 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
 And, maestro, conduct! 
 With passion. 
 You have ten shots. 
 Happiness. 
 That was eight. 
 You only have two left. 
 W-What? 
 You have two left. 
 We just started. 
 You want passion? 
 [shutter clicks] 
 This is the best photograph I've ever taken. 
 ...is they permeate your essence. 
 I am so sorry. 
 The maestro's not usually like that. 
 He's just, um... 
 He's under a bit of stress lately. 
 No, no, no. It's all happiness, brah. 
 He was fantastic. 
 There we are. Now give a look to the clock. 
 Turn back time with your eyes. 
 Yes. There we are. You're not going to be deterred, are you? 
 So let me ask you, how does your personal life inform your work? 
 Uh... 
 Maestro. 
 Hmm? Oh, thank you. 
 Sure. 
 I've never thought about that. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't think about those things. 
 I actually find them quite idiotic. 
 Maestros. 
 Can't live with them, can't run a major orchestra without them. 
 Thank you for being part of the photo shoot. 
 Listen Cynthia, you're an asset to this orchestra in so many ways, even more so now that you're chairwoman of the Players' Committee. 
 Orchestra admires you so, as do I. 
 That's great to hear because I would love your support in the upcoming negotiations. 
 We have a lot in common, you and I. 
 We're both fans of genius, conductors specifically. 
 You were a fan of Karzoff in Moscow and then of dear Thomas from '95 to '98 when he was at the London Phil, and then Carlotta Di Gozzi... 
 It's so hard to find great female conductors... and then of Thomas again. 
 And they were fans of mine, not that it's any of your business. 
 [Rodrigo shouting in Spanish] 
 He's quite a handful. 
 Do you see this trench in my forehead? 
 This... This is new. 
 These strong genius big shots, they're just... they're just really overgrown babies, aren't they? 
 Throwing tantrums. "I want this. 
 Give me that. You don't understand me." 
 Even if you do understand them, they don't believe that you do. 
 But not with you, Cynthia. 
 They know you understand them, therefore they trust you. 
 This dynamic could be very helpful to us. 
 What do you want? 
 Stay close to him. 
 In return, my door will always be open. 
 These are challenging times. 
 We both want this institution to survive. 
 The difference is you look at the orchestra and you see an institution. 
 I see musicians, and I think the audience... 
 Audience sees one thing: our new maest... 
 I am not going to talk about her, okay? 
 No! Okay? 
 Is there a problem over here, maestro? 
 No. We found the solution. 
 Oh, great. 
 The interview's over. 
 Ciao. 
 Hailey, put that sign up now. 
 Hah. Huh? 
 I didn't sleep with Rodrigo. 
 Anything else? 
 I really want to take lessons from you. 
 What are you, some kind of masochist? 
 Maybe. I don't know. 
 Don't you kind of have to be to play the oboe? 
 Look, you're the best there is in New York City, and you're the only shot I have at coming any closer to this. 
 You're right, I am the best, and some of that rubs off on my students, but I'm no miracle worker. 
 I'm good. I'm better than I showed, and I'm willing to make sacrifices. 
 What do you want, a medal? I'm expensive. 
 I don't care. 
 $400 an hour. 
 Holy sh1t. What? 
 No. Uh, I can make that work. 
 When do we start? 
 I didn't say yes. 
 If I feel like it, I'll let you know. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 My commute takes 45 minutes. 
 What?- This is bullshit. 
 "Rehearsal today is cancelled"? 
 "Bring a sweater"? 
 Okay, you're going to want to pull the corners of your mouth in so that you're fully supporting the reed. 
 Good. That's really good. 
 [cell phone jangles] 
 Uh... 
 And then you're going to want to inhale and then create a steady stream of air. 
 Hailey, Tim's finally going to get circumcised. 
 He's going in tomorrow. Should we bring him soup? 
 Lizzie, meet Duncan. He's 12. Put pants on. 
 Oh, for f*ck's sake. 
 Sorry about that. 
 [Cell phone jangles] 
 Not a problem. 
 You going to get that? 
 No. 
 [jangling] 
 Is it Alex? 
 Yeah. 
 Zip it and crow. 
 What, you're ignoring him now? 
 You're 12? No offense. 
 None taken. 
 Do you want me to do something about this? 
 No. Absolutely not. 
 I will deal with it later when I'm not teaching a lesson. 
 There are two things that are bugging you. 
 1, she was grinding her crotch in his face, and 2, they slept together, like, months ago, and they may still be boning. 
 [bad note] 
 Sorry. 
 Duncan, I think that's actually all the time that we have for today. 
 Well, here's the thing. 
 My mom won't pay for lessons with you anymore, so I was hoping I could pay with this. 
 A stamp? 
 It's a brown embossed SG 57 from Great Britain, circa 1847. 
 I predict it to be worth five lessons. 
 Duncan, I don't even know what to do with this. 
 You eBay it. That sh1t's worth $500. 
 Jesus. Deal. 
 Oh. 
 The course of conflict isn't determined by the person who initiates but by the person who responds. 
 My parents do marriage counseling, even though they're not together anymore. 
 Thank you, Duncan. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 Bye. 
 Don't talk to any strangers on the subway. 
 I won't. 
 Betty : I shared an apartment with two Hell's Angels down here in '79. Good times. 
 Hi, Betty. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Oh. Let me... 
 You will tell me next time he decides to pull something like this, yes? 
 I'll do my best, yes. 
 Bienvenue! 
 Welcome to the session. 
 Hailey. 
 Help me out. 
 Everyone. 
 Does this open? 
 No, that's why I... 
 Oh. Okay. All right. 
 This is so goddamn wrong on so many goddamn levels, I can't even tell you. 
 Welcome to the session, Bob. 
 Oh. Cynthia, you're wearing the bracelet, eh? 
 Of course. 
 Ah, and swift like a gazelle. 
 I have metal kneecaps, so I might as well use them, right? 
 Nice one, D.D. 
 Mikael. Warren Boyd. 
 Yeah. 
 You're-you're... You're in. 
 Svetlana, ah, watch it. 
 Hello, Rennie. 
 Hello. Hey, take care. 
 You okay? Watch it, watch it because I can... Yeah. I can help. 
 Now it's your turn. Go ahead. 
 Watch it, watch it, watch it. 
 Hailey. 
 Sorry. 
 No, it's okay, it's okay. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. You're free. 
 Oh. Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 Good. 
 Hello, Edward. I didn't know you were a boxer. 
 No, I'm not, but I train as one. 
 I got a sparring partner and everything. 
 Knocked him out by accident. 
 He's fine now. He's a trouper. 
 Mr. Beiben, your usual. 
 No celery, extra carrots, and raw Brussel sprouts. 
 May I get you anything else? 
 Uh, just bring my water, please. 
 Thank you, Joel. 
 Also, we're not going to eat this bread. 
 Yes, sir. 
 So, Gloria, I have got a 2:00 parent-teacher conference, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut right to the chase. 
 You look lovely, as always, by the way. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 I was being interviewed yesterday for the Times business section, and the reporter mentioned that our boy Rodrigo walked out on a Sunday magazine profile. 
 Yeah, it's being rescheduled. 
 I don't care. It was embarrassing. To me. 
 I mean, Thomas Pembridge may have lost his new car smell, but at least he was easy to drive. 
 Edward, bringing Rodrigo here was a risk we knowingly took because the risk itself was something we could market. 
 Sexy and dangerous. 
 You wanted a star. We got a comet. 
 And don't worry. I have him under control. 
 It doesn't look like it from here. 
 Nothing sexy about a train going off the rails. 
 I don't want to f*ck that. 
 Look, he'd better prove that he can lead this damn orchestra. 
 If not, I will advocate that Thomas be brought back next season. 
 Thomas? 
 You wanted me for my business insight, Gloria. 
 It's time you started running this place like one. 
 Classical music has been losing money for people for 500 years. 
 It's not a business. 
 Everything's a business. 
 So listen, at some point, I think you and I need to schedule a meeting to sit down and talk face-to-face about, you know, Rodrigo and the orchestra. 
 I'm confused. Aren't we having that exact meeting right now? 
 No. It's parent-teacher conference time. 
 Uh. Gloria Windsor, this is Ms. Alicia. 
 Gloria runs the symphony for us, and Ms. Alicia's in charge of my son's homeroom. 
 Hey, why don't we schedule a school trip to the symphony? 
 Let them watch rehearsal. 
 Yeah. That would be great. 
 Yeah. The musicians love field trips. 
 This humidity is f*cked up. 
 It's going to warp my wood. 
 Christ, Bob. It's an instrument. 
 It wants to be played. 
 I think I'm going to take my shoes off. 
 What are we doing here? 
 I know many of you must have questions. 
 We've got some earth here, some city around us, people in their homes. 
 Sometimes, when we lose our way, we must return to the basics. 
 That's where the beauty lies. 
 La bellesa de la vida. 
 We're going to play a piece that you all know very well. 
 It's the La Obertura 1812. 
 Tchaikovsky. Okay? 
 What the hell's going on down there? Who are you? 
 We're the New York Symphony Orchestra. 
 Ready? 
 ♪♪ 
 [screaming] 
 Are you okay? 
 No. No! No. 
 I am not okay. I... I need help. 
 I just can't keep being jerked around like this! 
 No. Mrs. Windsor, I see and hear a great deal of things around here. 
 The musicians, they smile when they come to work. 
 Not all, but more than before. 
 He cares about us. 
 He cares about himself. 
 But that's good to hear. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm... I... I'm sorry. 
 I'm so embarrassed. 
 I seem to have forgotten your name. 
 [chuckle] I'm Paviel. 
 But they call me Pavel. 
 Pavel. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's a nice name. 
 [chuckle] 
 Thank you, Pavel. 
 No. Thank you for bringing us the maestro. 
 
 
 
 ♪♪ ["1812 Overture"] 
 Ahh! 
 [applause] 
 Yeah! 
 [cheering] 
 Maestro! 
 That was fun. 
 Any questions? 
 Uh, yeah. Where's the bathroom? 
 Uh, I have a question. 
 Yes. 
 What's this one? 
 It's an oboe. Want to hold it? 
 Sure. 
 Don't be shy. Grab it like you mean it. 
 [laughing] 
 You do realize this was not a rehearsal. 
 This was a performance. 
 Yeah, and a really good one. 
 No. It's... 
 It's unsanctioned. 
 Yeah. It's unsanctioned. It was unhinged. 
 It was untethered, unclassified. 
 It's earthy, it's happening, and I have never seen these rosy cheeks of yours. Look at that. Look at that. 
 Thank you, maestro. 
 I've never seen you like... 
 [honking] 
 Pizzas. Pizzas. 
 Okay. Yes, for everybody, Bob. 
 Yes. Everyone... 
 Pizza break. 
 ...whoever wants a slice, just go. Hailey. 
 Here. 
 Hailey, Hailey, can you keep one for us? 
 Yeah. Meat lover's? 
 Meat lover? Meat lover? 
 Meat lover's. 
 Well, oh, okay, okay, fine. 
 Good job. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 You, too. You, too. 
 Just go. Go get it. 
 Go get it. Go ahead.Go get some pizza. 
 Go get some pizza, yes, everybody. 
 ♪♪ [Latin beat] 
 Everyone is loving it, no? 
 Yeah. This is amazing. 
 I'm talking about the pizza. 
 [laughs] 
 Vete, Hailey. 
 Yeah?- Come. 
 My God. Okay. 
 [sucking in] You know, guys, I used to live right around the corner in the '70s. 
 The decade. It was happening. 
 ♪♪ 
 [sirens] 
 Man : Damn it! The cops! 
 The police? 
 Yeah. 
 The police? Okay. Wait there. 
 Who's in charge here? 
 Wait there. 
 Who's in charge? 
 I'm in charge. 
 Ah, great. 
 Who are you? 
 My name is Rodrigo. 
 Man : He's the maestro. 
 Ah, good. 
 Mr. Maestro, right? 
 Yeah, you can call me like that. 
 Can you tell me what you're doing here? 
 Well, um, I took the orchestra for a field trip, you know, and because we play in the August Memorial Symphony Hall and it's getting a little bit stuffy. 
 I don't know if you've been there recently. 
 Guys, guys, step back, please, all right? 
 Step back, step back. 
 So you just decided to take everybody out on a little field trip to to have a block party. 
 No, it's actually for everybody. 
 It's all races. Everyone's welcome. 
 It's the New York Symphony, pig. 
 Hey, cool it. 
 Steve. 
 [crowd chatter] 
 Are these your wire cutters? 
 No. No, I borrowed them from Pavel. 
 I don't care who you are. 
 You're all trespassing.This is private property. 
 Can you please stop pissing on the wall back there, sir? 
 Who did this? Fold up this chair. Let's go. 
 Move it on out. Come on. Move it out. 
 Let's go, let's go. 
 Hang on, guys. Okay. 
 We're going to keep this under control, okay? 
 Drummer boy, pack it up.- Seriously? 
 What was that, sir? 
 I said "seriously"? 
 You have nothing else better to do with your time? 
 I need you to pack it up. Let's go. Guys, pick this up. 
 With everything ugly out there, you have to break up something so f*cking beautiful? 
 Is everything okay? 
 D.D. 
 What? 
 Take it easy. 
 I got a right to speak my mind, unless you want to take that away also. 
 Technically, he does have the right of free speech. 
 Right, my friend? 
 Hey, don't touch that! 
 [shouting] 
 Officer, officer, he's very delicate with his instruments. 
 Please be careful, okay? 
 You need to stay out of this. 
 My God! He's bending my arm! 
 [shouting] 
 Step back! Come on, now! 
 Hey, hey! Come on, step back. 
 Step back. Come on. 
 I'm definitely not gonna go in that car. 
 Fascists! 
 All right, let's go. Right this way. 
 All right. 
 I've got one ready for processing. 
 Open three. 
 Excuse me. 
 Have you given any thought to our oboe lessons? 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 No, I'm not. I'm a masochist, remember? 
 [chuckles] 
 I may have a slot available 6:30 a.m. Saturday mornings. 
 Great. 
 My student just got a seat with the Kansas City Light Opera. 
 I'll be there. Can't wait. 
 Officer, I'll be sure to have him back in time for the hearing. 
 [shutter clicks] 
 Thank you so much. Thank you for coming. 
 Oh, and since we got some tickets, I think it's only fair that you get some tickets to our upcoming season. 
 Contact my office, and you and your guest will be well cared for. 
 Thank you. 
 Aw. 
 Good manners, good manners, good manners. 
 Uh, it's just up here on the right, please. 
 You got it. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, um, here you go. Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Did you get my texts? 
 I don't really want to seem like some sort of stalker. 
 No, I was just, like, super, super busy, so that's why I didn't call you back. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, no. It's okay. 
 You're a really good choreographer. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 I mean, do you only take calls from... from bad choreographers? 
 Because, you know, if that is the case... 
 No. 
 ...I will try to suck more. 
 I saw you sleeping in Addison's bed. 
 It's stupid. I just... 
 I was watching TV in her room waiting up for you, and I fell asleep. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I know. Sorry. That... 
 Well, I don't know if this is the best timing, but, uh, I, uh... 
 I was going to actually invite you to come with me to Florida. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 Well, so I guess he was a modeling agent or something, came to my showcase and needed a dancer for a body spray ad, and yeah, he, uh, scouted me for the gig. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. Um... uh... 
 Florida. 
 Um... 
 I can't. 
 I have, um... an oboe lesson at 6:30 in the morning. 
 I know that sounds really ridiculous, but the lady who's giving them to me is really amazing, and she just, like, f*cking hates my guts, so it's the only time that she agreed... 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 ...to teach me, so... 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 6:30 in the morning. 
 Yeah. I know. It's horrible. 
 It sucks. 
 But it's really a big deal, and I just... I got to focus right now. 
 Yeah, I'd love to hang out when I get back. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. Have fun with your lessons. 
 Gloria, can I tell you something? 
 You should have seen them out there. 
 It was incredible. It was beautiful. 
 They were... Oh, my God. 
 I've retained legal counsel from Leonard Bernstein... not that one... who reminds me your O1 visa could be affected by your little adventure. 
 You could be deported, Rodrigo. 
 Oh, and I thought you'd like to see this from our friend Union Bob. 
 An invoice for $80,000 overtime, including a performance bonus. 
 Ah, it's okay. I'll pay it. I'll pay it personally. 
 Okay, but that's not the point. 
 It's a small price to pay for something so valuable. 
 Really, it was the first time that I felt that we were getting at something, you know? 
 That we were reaching some place. 
 Rodrigo, I am a true believer in your art, your attitude, your excitement, you. 
 I'm going to be straight with you. 
 Our orchestra is in serious financial trouble, deep financial trouble. 
 You understand what I'm saying? 
 Yeah. 
 Yes, Gloria.
