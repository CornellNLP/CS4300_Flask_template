 It's easier with the lips slightly wet. [Inhales deeply] In through the nose... [Exhales deeply] Out through the mouth. Remember, each breath is a bridge to another breath. [Cell phone vibrates] Each breath is a bridge. 
 All right, Duncan, I think that's enough for today. [Cell phone vibrates] Duncan, listen to me. 
 Yes, Miss Rutledge. 
 Tomorrow's a really important day, okay? For both of us. Everyone's coming. Your grandmother is coming. So can you do me a really big favor, please? Try and practice before bed... just a little. 
 I will, certainly. 
 Um, did your mom leave a check? 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 Ew.

 [applause] 
 I hope I wasn't too fast for you. 
 Oh, no, I thought you were rather sluggish tonight. 
 After you, maestro. 
 Beautiful, as always. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck. [Chuckles] 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Joshua Bell. 
 Safe trip to Beijing tonight. 
 Well... 
 As most of you know, tonight's concert marks the final performance that I shall give as the conductor of this very fine orchestra. 
 [Applause] 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, just because you won't see me here, it doesn't mean to say that I won't be here. 
 In fact, it's just the opposite. 
 I have gratefully accepted the newly minted role of executive musical director emeritus... 
 Whatever the hell that means. 
 [Laughter] 
 Before I do go, I would just like to say a heartfelt thanks to some very special people here tonight. 
 They are my colleagues, my friends... my family. 
 They are the men and women of your symphony. 
 Please. 
 [Applause] 
 And now will you please warmly welcome the woman behind the curtain, the board chairperson herself, Mrs. Gloria Windsor? 
 Thank you. 
 [Applause] 
 Good evening. Good evening. 
 Thank you, Thomas, for everything. 
 And so... as one movement ends, another must begin. 
 [Epic classical music plays] 
 It is my honor to introduce to you someone special. 
 At 12 years old, he was the youngest person to ever win the Mahler Award for young conductors. 
 At 23, he conducted at La Scala. 
 At 25, he lifted the Oslo symphony out of bankruptcy and placed them amongst the finest on the world stage. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 He has been courted by Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Munich, and we got him. 
 Please join me in welcoming a man who need only be introduced by his first name, your new conductor and musical director... 
 Ah! 
 Rodrigo!

 I think he's amazing. 
 That was a great performance tonight, maestro. 
 Look, Gloria, I love you, but don't ever underestimate me. 
 [Chuckles] Darling, I think you go to the same hairdresser. 
 [Chuckling] 
 So I'm playing this rich-bitch gig in Sag Harbor, and the hostess is working my shaft, my balls, my shaft, my balls, and I'm totally f*cking hammered off of six glasses of Riesling, and then I pass out. 
 And then...  
 Good night, boys. 
 Good night. 
 Good night, Cynthia. 
 And then chomp... 
 Hey, sexy, you going downtown? 
 Oh, I'm sorry, Cynthia. I'm going uptown.

 Cynthia, you're killing me. 
 If it wasn't for this pretty young lady, tonight would've been a disaster. 
 I owe you. 
 May I offer you a ride home? 
 Easy, Bernard. 
 What's your name? 
 I'm Hailey. 
 Hailey, you're coming with me. 
 Okay. 
 Deborah...  
 You're welcome. 
 For what? 
 Keeping Bernard out of your pants. 
 I thought I knew every oboist in town. 
 I'm Cynthia. 
 Cynthia Taylor, I know. 
 You're second cello in the New York symphony. 
 It's a real honor. 
 You drink, I hope. 
 [Cork pops] 
 To Rodrigo! 
 All : Rodrigo! 
 I just love these ideas. 
 They're so fresh, so innovative. 
 I can see. 
 Thomas, I'm so glad you came. 
 Can we get a glass of champagne? 
 It won't be necessary. 
 I won't be staying that long. [Snaps fingers] 
 [Paper rustles] 
 Is this a joke? 
 [Snaps fingers] 
 "Under the guidance of our new conductor, Rodrigo Desousa, our coming season will feature some surprising highlights, such as turning off the house lights and playing selected pieces in complete darkness. " 
 We hired Rodrigo to bring new ideas, a youthful point of view. 
 You were in on the decision. 
 You continue to be in on every decision that we make here. 
 What next? 
 "Bring a pet to the symphony" day? 
 Our subscribers, they're not gonna stand for... 
 Oh, put that champagne down, Sergeant Pepper. 
 Champagne is for celebrating, and I don't consider the erosion of a magnificent institution like this... 
 Stop being so dramatic. 
 I'm gonna go. 
 Thank you, Gloria. Thank you. 
 It's been lovely. Maestro, court, grazie. 
 Grazie. 
 Haven't you got anything to say for yourself? 
 In English, preferably. 
 Emily Wu, the first violin, she played sharp 17 times in the first movement alone. 
 And then the horns came a bar late, which completely threw off the clarinet, and we weren't able to perceive Tchaikovsky's desired dynamic shift from bars 27 to 34. 
 And Bruno, Bruno Cassel, the bass player... 
 He's old. 
 He can barely hold his bow. 
 I don't know who you were torturing more... me or him. 
 You prick. 
 Changes will be made. 
 And, maestro, I hope I don't disappoint you or the values of this great institution. 
 Hailey Rutledge, oboist. 
 Yeah, that's my parents' idea of a Christmas present, so... 
 [Laughs] I like the drawing. 
 So I have on the rocks for you. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 And a neat for you. 
 And actually, um, this round's gonna be on me. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Yeah, of course. My pleasure. 
 Thanks. 
 Cute ass, right? 
 [Chuckles] Totally. 
 [Chuckles] I bet he's a dancer. 
 They're the best. 
 The best? 
 Anecdotal evidence and my personal scientific research suggest there's a direct correlation between what a man does fora living and the way he f*cks. 
 Mm. 
 Violinists, for example... 
 Yeah, come on. 
 They tend to come quickly. It's all those arpeggios. 
 [Moans] 
 Percussionists pound you like you're in a porno. 
 [Loud slapping] 
 Kind of fun for about ten minutes. 
 Good cardio, though. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What about them? 
 Pianists... tricky. 
 Typically they fall into two general groups: jazz and classical. 
 I go for jazz. 
 Why? 
 Improvisation: they play off you. 
 Also, they're into ensembles. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 What about, um, conductors? 
 Too complicated. 
 Hailey, oboists area rare commodity these days. 
 Strings, on the other hand, we're like hyenas fighting over the same dead animal. 
 You're really good. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, so can I get you anything else, ladies? 
 Your name. 
 Excuse me? 
 Your name, skinny jeans. 
 [Chuckles] I'm Alex. 
 You look like a dancer, Alex. Am I right? 
 Yeah, I... I am, actually... ballet. 
 I'm training at Juilliard. 
 Alex, Hailey. Hailey, Alex. 
 Hailey is an oboist from North Carolina. 
 Alex is a ballet dancer here in New York. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Yeah, yeah, you too, Hailey. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 Uh, listen, I better be going. 
 Why don't you, uh, sit down and the two of you chat awhile? 
 Oh, well, actually, we could probably share a cab, so... 
 I'm not taking a cab, but I'll call you. 
 Let's stay in touch. 
 Change or, uh... ? 
 Have a fantastic time. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 It's all good. 
 Your friend's awesome. What is it, like, an $40 tip? 
 Yeah. [Chuckles] 
 You don't actually have to stay here and talk to me. 
 Well, hey, you know, I'm actually about to get off. 
 Uh, a bunch of us are probably gonna go out later. 
 Want to come with? 
 Oh, I'd love that. I just, um... I have to get up so early. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles] 
 All right, well, um... 
 That's cool. Enjoy your drink and... 
 Drinks. 
 Drinks, plural. 
 Yeah. My loss. 
 
 
 
 This is a $350,000 cello, you asshole. 
 Get in. 
 Don't treat me like a hooker. 
 I shouldn't have taught you how to text. 
 Pop it. 
 Ah, my whole world is falling apart. 
 He's good, isn't he? 
 Oh, well, don't tell me you wouldn't f*ck him. 
 Oh, please. Is this the kind of night it's gonna be? 
 Let me out. 
 Forget that. Keep going. 
 If you have to ask the question, you already know the answer. 
 Yes, he's good. 
 He's a monster. 
 He's making cuts... 
 Woodwinds and Brass for now. 
 The union will have something to say about that. 
 You can't just come in and install your friends. 
 Oh, I doubt he has any friends. 
 I was him once. 
 You still are.

 Yeah, I'm Lizzie. This is my place.

 Thanks. 
 North Carolina, right? I'm from Nashville. 
 That's kinda close, I guess. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Kind of. 
 It's a pretty overwhelming place, huh? 
 Totally. 
 I feel like all I spend my time doing is, like, figuring out how to make money and then figuring out how to be a good roommate and a good daughter, and, like, none of it is about the art. 
 So when I'm successful...  
 You think it'll be easier? 
 It better be. [Chuckles] 
 You know... 
 I've always wondered something. 
 Do your lips hurt after you play like that? 
 Um, I mean, they used to.  But now I guess they're, like, kind of used to being used, so... 
 That sh1t was f*cking disgusting. 
 And Hank had an accident on your bed too. 
 Oh, sh1t. Okay, thanks for your scarf. 
 Sorry.

 Rodrigo is holding auditions. 
 They're seeing Woodwinds until 11:00. 
 You didn't hear it from me. 
 I can't f*cking believe this is happening. 
 Okay, where were we? 
 Hailey, go. 
 You can sneak out through the service elevator. 
 What about your mom? 
 I'm not afraid of her. 
 And anyway, if you get that job, she'll brag to everybody that her son takes lessons from an oboist at the New York Symphony. 
 Get out of here.
