 What do you mean, I'm being tentative? 
 Like, uh... you're being like a little puppy dog, instead of being a pantera. 
 Oh. Maybe because your tempo is a little bit disco.

 No, it's not disco, Maestro.

 Dee Dee, you are gonna take that diaper off before we go in, I hope. 
 It's called Fundoshi. 
 I wear it when I teach my Taiko lessons. 
 All right, huh? 
 Hey, guys. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Just dropped off another happy customer. 
 Cynthia : Can't believe you're driver for Uber. 
 Yeah, actually, you know, you meet some really interesting people. 
 Where's Betty? 
 Uh, she can't make it. 
 Didn't she tell you? 
 Tell me what? 
 She's subbing with the Honolulu Symphony. 
 Oh, Jesus, guys, we gotta stop the bleeding before they take all of our people. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Maybe we should look at their offer again. 
 No. We looked at the offer, it's not good enough. 
 Yeah. 
 I tell you what we're gonna do. 
 We're gonna stay strong and dignified, and Dee Dee, your left testicle is falling out. 
 Aw, man. 
 Look, I'll figure out what we're gonna do. 
 Okay? I just need to think.

 Before you leave, remember, you're all invited to our show, "The Dirty Filthy Stains." 
 Good work. 
 Hey, thanks. 
 Okay. 
 Come, yeah. 
 Cynthia : Thanks for having us, Lars. The kids are great. 
 Yeah. It'd be a lot cooler if we had real instruments to work with, but, uh, yeah, they're trying. 
 Yeah, well, it felt really good to be playing something. 
 We needed this. 
 Well, hey, you know, if you need an escape, we're playing a few gigs on the road after the New York show. 
 You should come. It'll be fun. - Yeah? 
 I mean, Lindsay and the kids are comin'. 
 It's gonna be great. 
 God. You have kids already. 
 That's what they call life, Cyn. 
 It take it there's still no Mr. or Ms. Taylor. 
 Nope.  (sighs) 
 My last relationship sort of f*cked everything up, so... 
 I'm, uh, giving it a break for a while. 
 Hey. At least come to this gig. 
 Come on.

 (phone rings) 
 Where the f*ck are you? 
 Hailey : Oh, you know, in Venice. 
 Walsh fired me. 
 He fired you? That prick. 
 Yeah, I know. I know. 
 Don't you know anyone who needs, like, an oboing nanny, or... 
 It'll be fine. Welcome to the life of a working musician. 
 Oh, sh1t, I have to go. 
 Gotta go rehearse. 
 Yeah, I'm coming. 
 Is Rodrigo there? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 I need to speak with him. 
 It's really important. 
 Cynthia. 
 No. 
 Cynthia? 
 Maestro, I can hear you. 
 She needs you, it's really important. 
 You can't ignore me forever. 
 Hello. 
 Rodrigo, I've been trying to get hold of you for weeks. 
 Hey! Cynthia. I thought you were dead. 
 The Mayor has called us to a meeting. 
 The Mayor? I don't know nothing about the Mayor. 
 Everybody's talking about the Mayor, but I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Yeah, we need you here. 
 What? What... What are you talking... 
 Because he's trying to resolve the lock out. 
 You know, I just heard the word lock out, and that's it. 
 Okay? I'm not... I'm not interested. 
 No, this affects all of us. 
 I can't talk about the lock out. Okay, ciao. Ciao. 
 Rodrigo. Rodrigo. 
 Scuze. Attensione. 
 Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, No! No! 
 What? 
 Stop it. 
 My f*cking cell phone. 
 But it's to liberate you. 
 This is my cell phone. You can't just take people's things. 
 Guys. Guys. 
 Cynthia, I'm really sorry about that. 
 (sighs) 
 He was gonna throw you into the canal. 
 Come on, let's... let's go rehearse. 
 No, I'm having a really good time. 
 ♪♪ (accordion) 
 Ahh. They found me. 
 (yelling in Italian) 
 (speaking Italian) 
 Maestro, it's an honor and a privilege. 
 Antonio Parlotti, a friend of La Fiamma. 
 Oh, ah. 
 A viper. 
 Ah.  (laughs) 
 Oh, oh, no. 
 No, she means it in a nice way. 
 (speaking Italian) 
 (speaking Italian) 
 What about this tour? We've heard rumors often. 
 Will you be joining her? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Perhaps you know she'll never make it that far. Huh? 
 (scoffs) 
 And what's her current tranquilizer dose? 
 Tranquilizer dose? 
 Yeah. 
 Tranquilizer? You want a tranquilizer? 
 (breathing heavily) 
 Hey. Alessandra. 
 Hey. Don't pay attention to that idiot. Okay? 
 He only invents lies. That's it. 
 (panting) 
 He's an idiot, but he told the truth. 
 Maestro, amazing! 
 That picture will run in every paper in Europe. 
 I could kiss you, but I don't.  (chuckles) 
 (speaking Italian) 
 (speaking Italian) 
 Man : Where's the Maestro? 
 I specifically asked that he be here. 
 He's in Italy. 
 Hmm. 
 He left when Gloria's Bubbles moved in. 
 We'll have him back as soon as... 
 I don't care about your Bubbles, or your excuses. 
 What I do care about is Tuesday night. 
 Jeanine and I have been long time subscribers. 
 So, we're solving this thing today. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. 
 Go where? 
 Now! Right now! We're going. 
 
 
 
 "To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow." 
 Do you know who said that? 
 Audrey Hepburn. 
 Oh. 
 So there's your seeds, your fertilizer, and some tasteful German shrubs to frame the blooms, and no talking about the lock out. 
 Dig your hands in, and make something that grows together. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Wait, wait. Don't just drop them in there. 
 Oh. No? 
 Pour them in your hand. 
 Go ahead. 
 Yeah. Now... feel their energy? 
 Yeah. 
 Feel the seeds.  (laughs) 
 I've stopped a lot of fighting in this garden.  (laughs) 
 That bush, the teacher's strike. 
 The cedar, the firemen. 
 Those daisies...  (laughs) 
 The garbage men. 
 Cynthia : I think we should start in the middle right here. 
 We need to dig these holes further apart, so... make sure the flowers have room to grow. 
 Here we go. 
 Oh. Oh. I hope I didn't get mud on your Pradas. 
 Uh, these are the diffusion line. 
 I got them on sale, and aren't those Stella McCartneys? 
 Fair point. 
 You know, this has been hard for everyone, and I'm really sorry. 
 You know, Warren over there has had to sell his Bergonzi. 
 Bob's driving for Uber, Tanya's moved in with her mother. 
 Betty's in Honolulu, which, you know, now I say it out loud it doesn't sound so bad, but you get my point. 
 I'm worried when we do resolve this that we won't have a symphony to come back to. 
 Do you know how many donors we're losing? 
 Yeah, that's how this works. 
 A mutually assured destruction. 
 It's the only way we seem to get you back to the table. 
 But every day we lose money, we have less to give you. 
 Cynthia, please. 
 As a friend. 
 No, not the "F" word. 
 Not after you locked us out. 
 But if you hadn't let that lawyer of yours... 
 You know what? There was a deal right in front of your face on the table, and you were too proud to take it. 
 Oh, please, you don't know what I was doing. 
 You think I don't know what's going on here? 
 Huh? You keep us waiting, losing our minds, and then suddenly he called and you want to talk? 
 You know what we want, Gloria, so why don't you call me when you're ready to give it to us. 
 I'm gonna-I'm gonna take a 10 minute break if that's okay with you. 
 You better figure this sh1t out, Gloria. 
 We got a budget meeting in a week and a half, and this city's not gonna keep pouring money into an orchestra that doesn't play! 
 And before that, apologize to these damn plants. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 Every single one of them!

 Look out there at my city. 
 You can hear them laughing. 
 (seagulls squawking) 
 Strange, I can only hear the seagulls. 
 Because the people... they won't be laughing at you. 
 Your plane will take off even if I... I'm in ashes. 
 Everybody knows that you walked off stage once. 
 Nobody knows why. 
 Do you know? 
 I started to lose my high notes. 
 I heard it in my head again and again. 
 Whenever anyone talked to me, I couldn't hear anything else. 
 Just my voice becoming... old. 
 I understand, Alessandra. 
 They want me to fail, and when they're eyes are on me, I... 
 I also want to fail. 
 Then sing to me, then. 
 I'm your audience. 
 You're my audience. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Then I hate you. 
 Maestro, can I speak to you in here for a moment? 
 It's about some programming. 
 Oh, very... Well, yes, uh, absolutely delighted. 
 Oh, come on. Oh, wow! We are frisky.  (chuckles) 
 Oh, my morning. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, it must have been a heck of a good meeting. 
 Oh! It was a disaster. 
 I just need... I need to think about something else.

 Oh! 
 I am coming to Venice with you. 
 You are? That's great news. 
 You were right. 
 I know a little place, it's so romantic. 
 Okay, good.

 So, I guess you heard about the tour, right? 
 What tour? 
 Oh. Oh, God. 
 Um, well, here.

 I have to know.

 At singing? Hai Lai, I'm terrible at singing. 
 Conducting.

 Okay. Look at them. Connect with them. 
 Lift your hands, remember... 
 What piece are we doing? 
 Oh, you have to know what piece you're doing. 
 Don't ask me. 
 Which piece are we doing?

 Hm. North Carolina enters the big leagues.

 Okay.

 Bah. They're so... bah, da, da, da, da.

 She's like the salt in the dessert.

 Erik : So what's she like, you know? 
 The great Alessandra. 
 It's like a little scary. 
 Really? 
 She's like the Stevie Nicks of opera. 
 What's goin' on? Are you all right? 
 Yeah. No, no. I'm... 
 Just wondering what's going on with the strike. 
 You know I'm not supposed to really talk about it. 
 I know, I know, I just, like... 
 It can't go on that much longer, right? 
 What's Rodrigo said about it? 
 Nothing, really. 
 Maybe that's part of the problem. 
 He just has a bad relationship with red tape. 
 Core responsibility. 
 He didn't cause this. 
 The board are the ones that locked us out. 
 I mean, maybe we should just change the subject. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know it's not your fault, I know you're on our side. 
 I need to tell you something. 
 What? 
 I voted against the orchestra's counter offer. 
 Hailey. 
 Goodbye. 
 Hailey, sit down. Come on. 
 Look, Hailey, it... Come on, it's complicated. 
 It was to contain Biben, protect Rodrigo. 
 Yeah, but I've been complaining to you about how screwed up all of my friends' lives are because of the strike, and the whole time you're the one who f*cking caused it. 
 So go f*ck yourself, Erik.
