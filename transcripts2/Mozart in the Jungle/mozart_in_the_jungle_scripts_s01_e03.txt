 [thunder] 
 All I ever knew was darkness. 
 Then it came like a bright blade, without a single moon, a slow and blinding black. 
 I, Oedipus, saw everything. 
 I saw... 
 You. You. I see you. 
 What are you, filming me with your phone? 
 You know who I am? 
 Who do you think you are? There are copyright laws! 
 You little f*cking bitch. 
 [audience members gasping] 
 ♪♪ 
 Hey, Lazlo, fortissimo, Lazlo. 
 [music stops] 
 Uh, we... we need a double espresso, eh? 
 Not a... not a single one. 
 I mean, I know that this is a rehearsal, and, I mean, you guys are not used to give it everything you have before the performance, but I can assure you that this is the only way that this music is going to get into our bones. 
 There's no you. 
 No you. 
 No me. 
 We are different harmonic strains of the same vocal chord. 
 Together, together, if we connect, together can can communicate with them, with the people over there. 
 [whispering] Does he want it faster or slower? 
 Indulge me a little bit. 
 Indulge me and put your instruments down. 
 Put them down. 
 Just put them down. 
 The music... is not in the notes but in the silence between them. 
 Maestro? 
 Yes. 
 Time for a ten-minute break. 
 Okay. 
 Take ten. 
 So what are you doing this weekend? 
 Hmm. Rich-bitch wedding gig out in Sag Harbor. 
 At least they pay us, right? 
 Open bar. 
 Man : What's the score? 
 Does anybody happen to know the WiFi password? 
 Pizzicato Freak... capital P, capital F. 
 I'm just saying, don't empty your spit valve on me. 
 You're doing it on purpose. 
 A quarter ounce and a couple of Z-bars. 
 Just ask and ye shall receive. 
 You have to excuse me. 
 I always prefer the girls' bathroom. It's... it's just cleaner. 
 Are you satisfied with us? 
 No. No. 
 No, but that's my responsibility. It's okay. 
 I like your bracelet. 
 I noticed it when you were conducting. 
 I like your tattoo. 
 My bass clef? 
 I saw it when you were playing. 
 I couldn't help it. 
 You mean this one? 
 It's a souvenir. 
 Ah, a souvenir. 
 [humming] 
 Another souvenir. 
 When I leave, count to 10, and then go out, okay? 
 Okay. Bye. 
 There area few things in life that a woman should never see, and a view up Oedipus' toga is definitely at the top of that list. 
 Yeah. So the show, it's done? 
 It's, like, closed for good? 
 Yep. Hailey Rutledge, good luck charm. 
 It's hard to believe that I spent so many years learning how to blow air through a tube. 
 I think you're probably better off without it. 
 Your job being over, I mean, you know, it could really open you up to some new... new energies. 
 Yeah, well, I hope that these new energies come with some kind of salary because the only money I have coming in right now is from my one student and then a tiny check from the New York Symphony for dropping a f*cking oboe. 
 Oh, cue the violins. 
 All I'm saying is it's beautiful out. 
 You're day drinking with a sexy man. 
 Oh, wow. 
 And, you know, hey, if... if money's so goddamn important to you, I... I can get us a paying job right now. 
 It sounds, like, really, really suspicious. 
 [knock on door] 
 Uh, hang on a minute. 
 Yes? May I help you? 
 Yes, uh, I'm Bradford Sharpe. I'm here for the profile piece. 
 Oh. Yes, of course. Come on in. 
 Come in, come in, come in. How are you? 
 Nice to see you. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Wonderful. 
 Yes, yes. 
 Good, good, good. 
 So here, this is what I thought. 
 We could put the cameras here because I get such a... 
 By the way, did you see the BBC piece that I did for Panorama? 
 Of course. It was a beautiful piece. 
 Yes, thank you. It was excellent. 
 Anyway, put the camera here. 
 Get a nice, soft light from this big window here because it tends to feature my good side. 
 So where are the cameras? Are they parking? 
 There are no cameras. This is a podcast. 
 I'm a one-man mobile interviewing machine. 
 I got everything I need in my backpack. 
 Really? Well, that's, uh, that's thrilling. 
 Do come in. Let's maybe sit over here, then. 
 Great. Fantastic.

 She's pretty good, right? 
 [no audible dialogue] 
 Auntie Mary had a canary up the leg of her drawers. 
 Is that about the level you'll... 
 ♪ Freude ♪ 
 [singing "Ode to Joy" in German] 
 Thank you. That's... 
 This is... This is a treat. 
 I'm looking behind you at this photo of you conducting Mahler's Fifth in Vienna. 
 To me, historic. 
 In fact, I don't think it's ever been topped. 
 Thank you. I appreciate that, I really do, because I feel that that was probably the greatest performance that I've ever given, and, of course, the critics tended to agree. 
 Hold on. Let's... Let's start. Let's... Should we begin? 
 Oh, I thought we were. 
 No. 
 I mean, good God. 
 Say that again. 
 [chuckle] Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, let's see here. 
 Okay. 
 Welcome "Bach." 
 That was Xenokis with "Analogique AB. " 
 You're listening to another edition of "B Sharpe, " a musical podcast where classical music is our forte. 
 I'm your host Bradford Sharpe, and speaking of sharp, I'm sitting across from the sharpest of the sharp: Thomas Pembridge, international conductor, scholar, and famed interpreter of the music of Chopin. 
 In his new role as musical director emeritus, he's a very, very busy man. 
 Maestro, thank you for making the time. 
 It is beyond an honor. 
 First question, and... is classical music dead? 
 That is sheer and utter nonsense. 
 Classical music is as vibrant now as it's ever been. 
 Rodrigo has been described as a shaman with a baton, a genius with a 20-inch waist. 
 Well, he's definitely, um, I think a little more than a 20-inch waist. 
 You know what? It's a 28. 
 It's just the top part was really little. 
 Let me just say one thing. 
 And this may not be common knowledge, but, you know... 
 I actually judged a youth conducting competition that he won when he was 12 years old. 
 Now, listen, I'm not taking total credit for what happened, but all I'll say is that, um, it was my decision to bring him here. 
 Congratulations. Well, that said, what does it feel like, um, you know, to hear that he said, and I quote, 
 "The New York Symphony is a dead, irrelevant corpse"? 
 [chuckle] The press, God bless them, are always taking things out of context. 
 But, you see, that was the context. 
 It was a single-sentence statement. 
 There is no context. 
 Oh, I don't think so. Next. 
 Ahem. 
 Okay. That's my Chopin list. 
 Um, is it difficult to work with someone known for his controversial political associations, his public endorsement of hallucinogens and their benefits, not to mention his wildly tempestuous relationship with the performance artist musician Ana Maria? 
 Is this just going to be all about Rodrigo? 
 Maestro, with all due respect, no, but, you know, we must admit that he has become the focal point of the narrative. 
 Oh. Listen. Excuse me. 
 Would you just hang on for one second? 
 I just have to make one quick call. Thank you. 
 Absolutely. Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 Pardon. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me! 
 Prick. 
 Hey, you. You. 
 Are you an assistant of some kind? 
 Maestro? 
 All right, listen. 
 Listen, do me a favor. 
 Knock on my door in ten minutes and tell me my next appointment can't wait any longer. 
 Understand? 
 Ten minutes. Got it. 
 Good. What's your name? 
 Uh, Sidney Bickarose, Jr. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, uh, five minutes. 
 Five minutes, okay. 
 Please turn on. 
 Rodrigo : And now we begin our silent symphony. 
 [humming] 
 ♪♪ 
 Brass. Hit. 
 Fortissimo! 
 [speaking Spanish] 
 [groans] 
 
 
 
 Hey, Lazlo? 
 A man of superior talent will go to pieces if he remains forever in the same place. 
 Look it up. 
 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. 
 Oh. 
 I've got a quote for you. 
 "The heartbeat of New York City's artistic culture relies on the new experiences which immigrants bring." 
 Please, I told you. 
 I'm sick and tired of these banal Rodrigoisms. 
 No, no, maestro. 
 I'm quoting you from an interview you gave in 1988. 
 [knock on door] 
 Um, yes? 
 Pardon me, maestro. 
 Uh, yes, Junior? 
 Something urgent has come up. 
 Mm, don't you mean my next appointment can't wait any longer? 
 No, maestro, this is an emergency. 
 Oh, uh, all right. Make The New York Times a pot of tea. 
 This will have to be our last question. 
 I'll be right there. 
 Maestro, there's been an accident. 
 Come on. You'll be back in no time. 
 The "Hungarian March" would kill a 20-year-old trombonist. 
 We started out on this together. 
 It's only fitting that we play our diminuendo side-by-side. 
 You're not going anywhere. 
 Neither am I. 
 Oh, no. 
 I'm tired of wearing this frayed old tuxedo. 
 Sweetheart, mind if I ask you a question? 
 Anything. 
 Would you take my place as chair of the orchestra committee? 
 I'd be terrible negotiating with management. 
 My dear, are you aware that this raspberry Jell-O is not even on our current health plan? 
 I'm serious. 
 Meals are excluded. 
 We really need your help. 
 Well, then I'm honored. 
 Well... speedy recovery, old friend. 
 Hmm. 
 Forgive me for my passion. 
 Maestro, have you ever wanted something so badly that you just lose perspective of it? 
 There may be casualties along the way. 
 Stay the course. 
 No life without death, maestro. 
 I am honored to say that you are my mentor, and hopefully one day I can say that you are my friend if I may be so deserving. 
 Thank you. 
 I was surprised by what you said in there. 
 For a moment, I almost believed you were sincere. 
 I meant it when I said it. 
 Thomas. 
 Are you wearing eyeliner? 
 Ohh... 
 I have missed you. 
 I've missed seeing you... 
 Thomas. 
 ... in rehearsal. 
 Not here. 
 Where, then? 
 Your place. 
 Oh, sure. 
 Claire would just love that, wouldn't she? 
 What do you want me to do, tickle your ass with a feather? 
 You're acting like a child. 
 No, I'm not! 
 God. Please. 
 Hmm. What's this? 
 It's a bracelet. 
 Hmm. Nice. Where did you get it?

 [plinks counterpointing monitor beeps] 
 Get well, guapo. 
 Oh, I'm dreading this. 
 No, no, no. You'll be great. You'll be great. 
 You just got to go in there and say "I'm here for my money, and I don't give a sh1t what anyone else thinks about it. " 
 Yeah, but the thing is I kind of do. 
 Well, all right. Therein lies the rub. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Listen, you'll be great. 
 Oh, hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait. 
 Wait, wait. 
 Okay. 
 Here. Your cut. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 He's married. That's what's going on. 
 [knocking] 
 Ok, you know what? There's someone at my door. 
 I'm gonna call you back on this issue. 
 You wanted to see me, Kathy? 
 Yes. Come in. 
 Please sit down. 
 D. D. , I want to be frank. 
 Okay, but only if I get to be Sally. 
 That's funny, but this is serious. 
 I've been hearing some rumors, and I need to ask you point blank. 
 Are you dealing drugs to members of the orchestra? 
 Mm-mm. Not true. 
 D. D. 
 Okay, look, my... my brother's a doctor, and sometimes at the hospital he gets me... 
 I need some Percocet. 
 Yes. 
 How many would you like? 
 I don't see you coming up in our system. 
 How long was your employment? 
 Uh, three or four hours. 
 Oh. 
 Wow. 
 Let me try this. 
 Ah. Here you are, coded under Rodrigo's discretionary account. 
 I can't access that. 
 I'll need to bring this up with his assistant. 
 I'll be right back. 
 [murmuring] 
 [laughing] 
 Hailey, Rutledge, here you go. 
 $89. 35. 
 Just sign here. 
 And you still need to sign the back of the check to get the money. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. Can I get Rodrigo's check advance? 
 Hey. 
 I saw you laughing at me. 
 Ha ha ha. 
 I'm already embarrassed enough as it is. 
 You don't need to rub it in my face. 
 You know, I've... I've worked really hard to even have half a percent chance of playing on that stage, and I did it, even if it was just for one second. 
 And I wish... I wish I could take this check and I could frame it and I could hang it on my wall, but I can't because I need that $89. 
 Do you know how many hours I've spent practicing the oboe? 
 I'm 26. I have practiced five hours a day seven days a week since I can remember. 
 Why don't you tap that into your computer and figure that sh1t out? 
 Making reeds, having no social life. 
 I didn't know how to swim or ride a bike until well into middle school. 
 How long have you been sitting at that desk practicing how to be a bitch and being f*cking rude to people? 
 Maybe you're just a natural at it. 
 Can you hear the hair? 
 Because I can't hear sh1t. 
 All I can hear is an egomaniac with a f*cking parrot. 
 Oh, God. 
 Maestro, will you ever forgive me? 
 Do not do something so bold and then back away from it. 
 Okay? Never ever ever. 
 You know, all that crazy anger that you just expressed, it should have come to me. 
 As a man that people feel obligated to flatter, it's always nice when people, like, say the truth, you know? 
 So thank you for that. Thank you. I appreciate it. 
 But talking about the truth... 
 Come. 
 I saw you. 
 You have talent. 
 You play with blood. 
 I put you on that stage, and you are not ready. 
 You know that, right? 
 You have talent. 
 You have it. 
 And who knows, you know? 
 Maybe in the future, something. 
 But in the meantime, if you remain as truthful as you are with me right now... 
 I think I can offer you a job. 
 It's a very small salary. 
 You can be close to the orchestra. 
 You know, you can learn whatever there is to learn from me. 
 You can practice your music. 
 You can help me annotate the scores, you know, and the mate, for example, you can help me make it. 
 I mean, it's quite easy. It's... 
 You first pour it in... in a 45 angle. 
 I mean, it's very... I'll explain to you later, okay? 
 It's like, uh, it's very easy. 
 What do you say? 
 Yes, maestro. 
 Truth? 
 Yes, maestro. 
 Yes. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 One more thing, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Grab it. 
 Okay. 
 Cut the hair. 
 With passion, Hailey.
