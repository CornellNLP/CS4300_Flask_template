 After our last raid, The Widow will shift her supply route west. 
 We could hit her here at Broken Rock. 
 Or we could work on building our ranks and leave The Widow alone. 
 Iron Rabbit. 
 What? 
 A carrier pigeon just arrived. 
 Tell everyone to grab their gear. 
 Tilda? You're the Iron Rabbit? 
 Get the truck. 
 Kill the bitch! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Not bad... 
 For fighting children. 
 Should'a run while you had the chance, little Rabbit. 
 Maybe you're not worth a tattoo, but I did promise The Widow your head. 
 Get her out of here. 
 Where are they taking the Iron Rabbit? 
 Bugger this thing! Huh? 
 I feel like a penguin in this getup. 
 Just keep it on. 
 We gotta look the part if we're gonna make it past their lines. 
 Fine. But we look like bloody idiots if you ask me. 
 Remember, stay in character. Try not to kill anyone, or everyone. 
 Big smiles. 
 You made it! 
 Yeah, we heard the Iron Rabbit got you. 
 This child is important to The Widow. 
 Don't ask us why, but we have to get him to a healer across the lines. 
 Hmm. Well, good luck with that. 
 There's only one way and it's impenetrable. 
 What do you mean? 
 Come on. You can see for yourselves. 
 Hold him down. Let me assess this. 
 Supply truck made it through. 
 Any Morphine? 
 No. Typical. 
 Who's in charge here? 
 Well, that would be baby face here. 
 You're in charge? 
 Well, since the major got killed, then her lieutenant, then half the company. 
 What happened? 
 Look, these buildings funnel to a choke point that's controlled by Chau's archers. 
 They never miss. 
 They miss sometimes, but when they do, it's worse. 
 Not for the dead. 
 This baby needs rest. 
 He's very sick. Somewhere quiet. 
 Then you're gonna show us what we're up against. 
 Let me take him. 
 It's this way. 
 I'm glad you decided to join our cause, Viceroy. 
 I think that together we could do a lot of good. 
 I took the liberty of preparing your son's old house for you. 
 My driver will take you now. 
 You really do think of everything, don't you? 
 I just hope this isn't a decision I come to regret. 
 We call it "sniper alley." 
 One way in, one way out. 
 Salo was the first to die. 
 They don't always shoot to kill. 
 Their arrows are dipped in poison. 
 It can take a long time to die. 
 We tried leapfrogging from car to car while our archers put up cover. 
 Didn't matter. They picked us off one by one. 
 Why not go through the buildings? 
 We tried. They booby-trapped the hell out of them. 
 Lost six more that way. 
 How many shooters? 
 At least three. 
 Watch. 
 Whoa. Hey. Try mine. 
 Do it. 
 You see, no one likes the hats. 
 We attack again in a few hours. 
 I can't risk more lives just to get a kid through. 
 I wasn't asking your opinion. Those are my orders. 
 Your orders? 
 I'm your new Regent. 
 I know Tilda's the Iron Rabbit. It's a cute name, by the way. 
 Next time she shows her face, she's mine. 
 You'll never catch her, and she'll just keep on taking down your convoys. 
 Why just mine? Why not Chau's? 
 Isn't it obvious? 
 Tilda's just trying to get at her mother, like any girl her age. 
 You think this is just a phase? 
 I think she wants something more than my supplies. 
 My recognition that she is a threat. 
 And now that she knows that she has it, she'll be back, because I am her mother, whereas you, you're just an inconsequential fling. 
 Who is the spy who warned you we were coming? 
 It could be anybody, because no one is buying your bullshit anymore. 
 Feel free to get creative. 
 But keep her pretty, just for now. 
 I don't want to break my daughter's heart when she comes home. 
 I want a name. 
 It's good to have you back where you belong, Baroness. 
 Thank you, Maryanne. But I'm a Viceroy, not a Baron. 
 The Widow can call you what she likes. 
 You'll always be a Baroness to us. 
 As you can see, we're still getting the house back in order. 
 Oh, trust me, I'm used to worse. 
 How are the poppy fields? 
 We've lost a lot of workers to the frontlines. 
 But with some luck, we can still bring in the harvest. 
 Oh, and I almost forgot. 
 The Widow sent some designs for you to review. 
 Designs? For your new insignia. 
 This one isn't bad. 
 What? You don't like it? 
 When I think of horses, I think of them pulling a plow. 
 Useful servants, in other words. 
 But people forget horses once ran wild in the Badlands. 
 Before the Barons, they had no masters. 
 So, you're saying... Maryanne, we may both serve at The Widow's pleasure, but that doesn't make us servants. 
 Sure it's tight enough? 
 Boy is supposed to be dangerous. 
 Can't take any chances. 
 Guess not. 
 Any change? 
 He's in and out. Mostly out. 
 Wait outside. 
 Untie me. 
 So that you can try to kill yourself again? 
 What were you thinking? 
 You said you were my only way out. 
 When you overdosed, did you experience something? 
 You were muttering in your sleep. 
 Just the usual. 
 Tunnel of light. 
 Gods calling my name. 
 You, lying in a pool of your own blood. 
 What a waste. 
 You could've made a real difference, M.K. 
 Madam Viceroy? The Widow's Regent is here. 
 Nathaniel. 
 Sorry for the intrusion. Oh, you're not disturbing me. 
 Let me get you a drink. Bourbon, two fingers, no ice? 
 You know, it's funny the little things you remember, after all these years. 
 Little things like your handwriting. 
 You're not even gonna try to deny it? 
 Well, would you believe me if I did? 
 Playing both sides. 
 That's a dangerous game, Lydia. 
 Only if The Widow finds out. 
 And you're not gonna tell her. 
 You're that sure of me? 
 I'm sure of the man I knew... 
 Who turned his back on the Badlands. 
 And yet here you are again. 
 Why? 
 To kill the man that dishonored me. 
 Quinn's former Regent. Sunny? 
 How did he dishonor you? 
 By refusing to finish the fight that he won. 
 And letting his friend Bajie take my sword, as well as my hand. 
 So you want to kill him because he didn't kill you? 
 At least some things haven't changed, you're still as pig-headed as ever. 
 So what about you? Why are you here? 
 Oh, people keep asking me that. 
 And what do you tell them? 
 That I can do more good here than I could in a refugee camp. 
 I want to give people a reason not to become refugees anymore. 
 You don't believe me? 
 I know you, Lydia. 
 Altruism isn't your only motivation. 
 You're right. 
 People like The Widow and Quinn aren't built to last. 
 They dazzle like fireworks, then burn out quickly. 
 Leaving others to rekindle their ashes. 
 And you're gonna be that person. 
 Well, if there's one thing I've learned, it's how to survive. 
 What if there was something better? 
 I mean... 
 ...I may have come back here for one reason, but I could think of another reason to stay. 
 What are you saying? 
 How many years have passed? 
 But when I saw you at that camp, I realized one thing hasn't changed. 
 My feelings for you. 
 Those feelings will get you killed. 
 Mercy isn't an asset in a Regent. 
 Nor is love. 
 Just ask Sunny, if you manage to track him down. 
 Maybe I will, before I kill him. 
 Hey, hey. Have you ever heard the old saying, "A plan is just an excuse to do something stupid"? 
 No. No, you wouldn't 
 'cause I've just made it up. 
 This is something stupid. 
 You know what I'm saying, right? 
 When I say go, we'll work our way up opposite sides of the street Arthur, you're with me. Bajie, take the girl. 
 The name's Wren, in case you need to scream for my help. 
 You cheeky minx. 
 You know that's your new Regent, right? 
 Sorry, I just wanna get on with it. 
 She wants to get on with it. 
 Another minute, Wren. 
 Go. 
 Heads down. Heads down. Heads down. 
 You go first. 
 Keep moving! 
 Heads down. Eyes up. Let's go. 
 Cover them. 
 They're using her as bait. There's no "they." 
 There's only one shooter. How do you know? 
 Arrow trajectories. 
 Help. 
 Arthur! Grab her! 
 Stay close. 
 That's it. Come on. 
 Let's go. Let's go. 
 Is this part of your plan? 
 Let's go. Go! 
 Come on. Get her inside. Get her inside. 
 Ouch. Easy. 
 It's just a splinter. 
 I swear, you're more of a baby than that baby. 
 I just don't like needles. 
 Goes back to a childhood thing. 
 You should heal up fine. 
 I wish I could say the same for Wren. 
 Is there anything you can do for her? 
 The new Regent's already sent their truck to the Sanctuary for more morphine and supplies, but I doubt it they'll be back anytime soon, so... 
 How'd you do that? 
 It's a long story. 
 That leg is already infected. 
 She probably won't see morning. 
 Idiot. 
 You sold us out. 
 I assume no one saw you come in. 
 And no one will see me go out. 
 Six of my people dead including Odessa and you're gonna follow them into the dirt. 
 Odessa is not dead. What? 
 They took her prisoner. 
 One look and The Widow knew you were the Iron Rabbit. 
 You told her where to find us. 
 And I also warned you they were coming. 
 I'm assuming that's why you're still alive. 
 Who are you? 
 One day you're protecting the refugees of The Widow's war and the next you're signing on to be her what? 
 Viceroy. 
 If I wasn't gonna be a true Baron, I didn't want the title. 
 So, in other words, you're a puppet. 
 I guess you're just right back to where you started, in the big house with the fancy clothes and the house Cogs at your beck and call. 
 At least here I can try to do some good. 
 Which would you have chosen? 
 If the price was giving up my friends, I'd have let her kill me. 
 You're very young and very naive like I once was. 
 If you wanna change the world, you have to find a way to live in it first. 
 One like this, like you? 
 No, you'll find your own way. 
 But it won't be playing outlaw in the woods to get back at Mommy. 
 I see in you what I'd hope for in my son, Ryder. 
 Someone who could be a better leader than any of us. 
 But only if you learn to play the game, and that means compromise right up to the line but not over it. 
 You're not... You're not gonna use that old thing? 
 Crossbows only get one shot before they have to be cocked and reloaded. 
 Yeah, but it's still easier to aim. 
 Not for me. 
 I trained with one of these, and the best weapon's always the one you started with. 
 So who trained you? My Regent. 
 Total b*st*rd, but he could cut the wings off a fly with one of these. 
 Open up, it's your Regent. 
 What are you doing approaching the wall at night? 
 It's against regulation. 
 We need urgent supplies in Sector 17. 
 Regent's orders. 
 Regent? I'm your Regent. 
 Naw, he's, uh... 
 I mean, I saw him. 
 Describe him. 
 About six feet, short black hair, with a long black sword with silver rings along the blade and an animal skull below the hilt. 
 Rubbing alcohol? 
 Are you really gonna drink that? 
 Yes, I am. 
 Go on. 
 Chilly out here. 
 All right, that's it. 
 
 
 
 Where does it hurt? 
 All right, okay. 
 Just hold still. Hold still, all right? 
 All right? 
 It's just a little trick I picked up from my journey. 
 Must have been an interesting journey. 
 Oh, well, I mean, it's been colorful. 
 What about you? 
 I was spider Cog in one of Baron Hassan's mills, spinning fabrics. 
 When The Widow clipped him, I threw in with her. 
 Right. And now you're here, fighting her war. 
 Frying pan into the fire, no? Hmm. 
 I found out I was good at it. 
 Anyway, war beats weaving. 
 Yeah, all right, that's fair enough. 
 Tell me something, am I dying? 
 At least you're honest. 
 I think I'm gonna go back to sleep now. 
 It was nice talking to you. 
 Whatever your name is. 
 My name is Bajie. 
 It was nice talking to you, Bajie. 
 Hey, hey. 
 There must be something that you can do. 
 There isn't, and I can't waste the time or resources trying. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. You misunderstand me. 
 There must be something that you can do. 
 Could try cutting off that leg, but without morphine, the shock alone would kill her. 
 Yeah. Do it now, all right? 
 I'll get her through the night. 
 Yeah? Go on. Go. 
 Okay. 
 Fire! 
 Nice and tight? 
 Yeah. Yeah? 
 You ready? Do it now. 
 Yeah. 
 Get it done. 
 This is not my war. 
 I'm just trying to get a sick kid through the lines. 
 Not gonna happen, huh? 
 I told you, this isn't my war. 
 Are there any other survivors from your unit? 
 But you stayed. 
 Our orders were to hold the pass. 
 I did what I did because it was my duty. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
 I know all about duty. 
 So that's him. 
 He's a prisoner of war now. 
 Make sure no harm comes to him. 
 Understood. 
 Hey, hey. 
 It's okay, it's okay. 
 Hold my hand, hold my hand, hold my hand. 
 Look at me. Look at me. 
 Look at me. 
 It's okay. 
 You're good. 
 I gave you an order. 
 He got what he deserved. 
 Okay, that's good. All right? 
 There you go. Yeah. 
 Rough night, you know. 
 I'm guessing not as rough as yours though. 
 Man, you should've seen... 
 He was unbelievable. What? 
 ...crossbows. We're literally... We're chasing him. 
 He's on top... He's on top of the building and he's shooting at us. 
 They're just kids, on both sides of the lines. 
 Fighting their Barons' wars, never asking why. 
 So I bring my knife out... 
 I bring my knife out, put it to his throat and I just... 
 He was dead in seconds. 
 Proud killers... 
 Just like I was. 
 I'm gonna remember this one. 
 Hey, I just wanted to say thank you. 
 For what? 
 Looks like she'll make it. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey! You look absolutely... 
 You asshole. 
 I'm done. I can't fight. 
 Can't even pick poppy. 
 So what am I supposed to do now? 
 Sell myself to anyone who wants a one-legged doll? 
 I mean, yeah, you got a crappy deal, but it beats the alternative, doesn't it? 
 Does it? Does it really? 
 It... It won't always be like this. 
 Yeah, you think we're gonna wake up one day and this shitty world will be transformed? 
 That someone like me will finally get the chance to live a half-decent life? 
 Well... 
 Tell me you really believe that. 
 Yeah, I didn't think so. 
 Change will come. Right? I mean, it... It has to. 
 Well, if it does, it'll arrive too late for me. 
 Just go. 
 Go! 
 I'm sorry. I'm... 
 I'm here to see The Widow! 
 The Iron Rabbit, I presume. 
 I'd pretend to be surprised, but we both know that this reunion, it's overdue. 
 Cut the bullshit. You wanted me, I'm here. 
 I'll make you a deal. 
 You give me Odessa, I'll stop raiding your convoys. 
 I could stop you right now. 
 You may have sicced your new dog on me but you won't kill me yourself. 
 Even if you could. 
 You think you'd be any more of a challenge this time? 
 You'll be surprised. 
 I have a better idea. 
 You'll be pleased to know she didn't tell me anything. 
 Even what I already knew. So I'm happy to let her go. 
 But not raiding my convoys, it isn't enough. 
 What are you proposing? 
 Come back. 
 Fight with me in any capacity you choose. 
 I'll provide sanctuary for the refugees and I'll help you supply them until the end of the war. 
 I can do that on my own. 
 No, you can't. 
 And I can't do this on my own either. 
 That much I admit. 
 You've got a new Regent. I need my old one too. 
 I'm open to it. 
 But now I need more proof of your good faith. 
 Like what? 
 M.K. Let him go and I'll make the deal. 
 Rise and shine. 
 Dinnertime. 
 Remember what I said I'd do when get my Gift back? 
 Guess what. 
 M.K., don't! 
 Not this way. 
 I'm leaving. You coming? 
 Let's go.
