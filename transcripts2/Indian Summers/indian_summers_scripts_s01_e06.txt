 My life is not your life. My life is my own! 
 The man you married is alive... and you just simply took yourself off. 
 Adam, you must trust us to look after you. 
 Kindly inform Mr Sood that under no circumstances will you work under a native. 
 If you work for me... 
 I will raise you from your ignorance. 
 I said if she is fit to work, you start working today. 
 I was dreaming of your father. 
 Let's meet the child. 
 Why give them hope when there's no hope? 
 (Thunder rolls) 
 (Crickets chirp) 
 (Floor creaks) 
 (Door slams) 
 (Crickets chirp) I didn't know it was going to be so exotic. (Snake hisses) What? No, no, no fuss. (Hissing continues) The key here is to remain perfectly... Yes. .. calm. GUNSHOT Argh! Argh! Did you... did you see it? I got him all right, did I? Did you see it? It's all right, Madeleine! You're quite safe! Is anyone hurt? Do forgive us, charging in. Just caught me by surprise, that's all. Chin up. Little sips. Thank you. Damn fine shot. Lucky I was passing. Madeleine : What a perfect fool. What's this? Erotic carvings. It's a ruined temple. Apparently. Mr Keane was leading us on a cultural excursion. If you ever wonder what lies behind all those dull vacant stares, there's your answer. The important ones are all round the back. Yes. Aren't they always? Now, I propose we escort you back as far as the tar road. It's going to bucket down any minute. Yes, I think I'd like to get back. Right, then... that's settled. Your name? Captain Farquhar, sir. Royal Irish First Battalion. (Men chatter in hindi) (Madeleine groans) Farquhar : That's it. (Horse snorts) Good girl, good girl. You all right to walk a bit? Of course I can walk a bit. Then grab hold of the lead rope, here. I'll escort the other lady. Mr... Keane. Royal Irish. You're a long way from home. We're going to climb a mountain. Just as soon as we get the permissions through. What an interesting day. Thank Dr Kamble for his visit. We look forward to the Prime Minister's recommendations. And as to his particular request, sir? Spectemur agendo. Sir? Let us be judged by what we do. (Children play in background) (Music swells) Ah. Excuse me. It's been ten years. You sure it was her? Ralph? If she were to be taken away, put somewhere? She'd only come back. I will speak to her. No. No. You're going nowhere. Till we decide what to do. What did you have in mind? I don't know, Ralph. I'll talk to Kaiser. He tends to know somebody. She had the child with her. The child? (Birdsong) (Crickets chirp, lapping water) I thought we were going to school. Not today, we're not. Come on, I'll race you. Oh, oh, oh-ho-ho! Oh, he's fast. He's a fast lad, go! Never disregard the monsoon crop. The taste is bitter, but the Kashmiris will drink almost anything. Naturally, your uncle left the leaf to rot. He was doomed to fail. Even without his wasteful, good-for-nothing life. Well, God help the living, sir, if that's how you speak of the dead. I am a businessman, not a hypocrite. Good for you, sir. You know, once I was a cheery young fool like you. And what are you now, sir? Not so cheery and not so young. In hindi : (Man speaks in hindi) (Thunder rolls, rain pours) (Men mutter in hindi) (Typing, chattering) Good snack? Miss Whelan. Mr Dalal. I'm afraid Mr Whelan is engaged in a business matter. How busy and important of him. Yes. Mukherjee, correspondence for redrafting. At once, please. It is for the evening post, it will require the Viceroy's counter-signature. Right, sir. Mukherjee. You are... well? If memsahib would be more comfortable in the lounge, I can arrange for tea to be served? No. I'll wait right here. (She clears her throat) Alice. You're late. Come on. (Locals chatter) (Rain pours, loud footsteps) (Chair smashes) (Ramu speaks in hindi) (He shouts in hindi) Bhai-sahib. Bhai-sahib. I think we know who is the thief. The Tamil woman. There was a beggar woman. You gave her work in my field, yes? YES?! I told him she was no good, but on the spot, against my advice, he employs her. Rubbish. What woman? This morning, she was here. Now, gone. Nobody has seen. What does that prove? Nothing. Last evening she was glimpsed, outside on the path. Get out. Get out of my house! May I at least know what was stolen, so I can replace it? Because nothing can be replaced, so get out. GET OUT! Find this woman. Prakash, find this Tamil woman! (Thunder rolls, rain pours, drips into bucket) 'Dear Leena, I regret that other commitments have kept me from your side.' What is that? Blasted tiles again? Well, the winter we've had. I've got a few spares somewhere. I'll have a go later. Your hair's all wet. Is it? (Rain drips) 'Look what I found. I know Adam had been hunting for it. I hope it cheers him up.' (Thunder rolls) (Birdsong) (Locals chatter) Ma? Is the dasturji coming for dinner or...? Aafrin! What is this? You remember Sooni's old class mate? Sita? Correct. My son has always had a sound head for names, even when he was a child. No. Go and sit there. With your sister. (Tableware clatters, dog barks outside) You can eat with your hands, if you are uncomfortable. No, there's no need. Thank you. Please, start. Now, Sita, did I tell you my brother will be taking ICS examinations this coming winter? Really? I think you might have said. Look at him... so pink and fat. Who knows? Maybe one day he will be Viceroy himself... Sooni... .. and there will be heavenly dances, and when the lights are low people will say, "Is he Indian at all? I simply cannot tell!" Sooni! My sister amuses no-one but herself. You know, even as we dine here, the Viceroy is drawing up plans for a new elected Indian Assembly. Well, Gandhiji must be turning cartwheels in his prison cell. I'd like to see him try. Ssh. Aafrin, your brother... believes it is necessary... Come this precious revolution of yours, we cannot have chaos. We need experienced hands to govern this country and Indian civilians will be well placed to ensure a smooth handover. And you call this revolution? British leave and the Indians go on salaaming to their shadow like nothing has changed. Try the rice. All these speeches are whetting my appetite. Of course. Baapi is a true Indian. Only this morning, I caught him praying for swift recovery of the Prince of Wales from a summer cold! Poor fellow, he's under the weather. I pray for him as I would for anyone. Oh, Ahura Mazda. Spare a handkerchief, oh, wise and blessed creator. Mock me if you wish... Stop it! ..but remember who it is but the British that gave you the education to sit there scorning your own father. (Clanging) (Chair scrapes across floor) Shamshad... (Tableware clatters) Forgive us. Please. We only wanted to thank you, Madeleine and I, for taking care of that boy that appeared at the engagement party. Oh, it's the least I could do. Adam is one of ours now. So I hear. (Birdsong, bird calls) Anyway, I got to thinking, you are rather cut off over at Lady Camarthen's old place? Oh, yes. But we seem to manage. Good. Well, that's good. But now with the rains... Why don't you make me a list? I'm sorry? An inventory, if you like. Any repair work around the school. I'll put in a word with the Board of Revenue. For the children. Thank you. That would be a godsend. Good. I'll get onto it right away. I wonder what she wanted? Hard to tell. The boy didn't say? Well, according to him, she was hoping to meet someone. "Someone"? Well, she's living rough on a lake up near Huttoo Peak. I wouldn't read too much into it. No. As you say. Don't forget that list. Forgive me, my eyes are not what they were. Sometimes I see what I want to see. Who is it, please? Jaya? Wait. Please, look away, I am not ready... I'm sorry, I had a job finding you. What are you doing here? "A kiss within a cup..." What? ".. and I'll not ask for wine." Don't you remember? Of course, I remember. Not two minutes ago, it popped into my head... and I knew. I knew it was a sign, you see. If I had known that you were in such... difficulty. Difficulty? Yes, you could call it that. But didn't I always say? See, I am not alone. I am only waiting. In the end, he will come. Oh, such wicked things he used to say about you. Who? Rakshas. Rakshas. Demon. Snake. Now he is dead. Your father? He meant no harm. He tried to shoot me. Not him. No, no, no. It was put in his mind. His mind? By the boy. Your son? Ours. Our child. (Market sellers call out, handbell rings) Fresh? It seems your father is not well. It's too much of your rich food. Aafrin... Huh... .. Newton's Third Law... Yeah, uh... For every action there is opposite and equal... Aafarin & Shamshad : .. reaction Yes, I knew that. I knew that. Bye. Jaanu, just a little soup, please. Only if you don't mind. (Locals chatter, chickens cluck in background) Oh. (Goat bleats in background) (Plate clatters) There. Soup. You will need to be strict with him. He is a good, kind boy, but he has the evil eye. What? I have seen. Ever since the minute he was born. Cows give no milk, earth dries up. I do my duty. Sh-sh-sh. I try to bleed it out, but... (Man calls out in hindi) Who is that goonda? I don't know. Look... .. we must find you somewhere to stay, hm? Where you can be provided for. And the boy. Now, I have heard of a fine place by the sea, down near Puri, do you know it? The things they have done to me. Over and over again. Who? Men. Men? What were their names? Too many names. And there was a woman. English. What woman? She was the worst. Do I know her? You can't stay here, you must see that? Look at you. So cold. Sit. Huh? Forgive me. See? I kept it. So have you climbed the Himalayas before? No, this is my first time East of the Suez. And? How do you find us? Horribly quaint? People generally do. Well, I rather fancy it. Jolly old house, pandering servants, Empire at your feet. Perfect. Now you'll have to forgive us. You just got here. Astronomer's waiting. Didn't I say? I promised the chaprassi we'd get our horoscopes done. Absolute hell if we don't choose an auspicious day, you see. For the wedding? Astronomer? (Door slams) (Groaning) Wait, wait, wait. Wait. (She breathes heavily) (Groaning) (Groaning intensifies) So, what's your story? I mean... what are you actually doing here? Me? Oh. I'm running away. Can't you tell? I say. What from? Disappointment. You on the lookout? For a husband? You must be. God, no. Oh. Spoken for. No-one speaks for me, Captain Farquhar. What? This is jolly good. Oh. Some clerk did it. What, a local chap? "Local"? I see. Yes. Could've almost been done by one of our lot. Almost? Yes, but not quite. Something smells off. I blame the subject. Look, I have to get back. That was quick. We'll just have to muddle through without him. Yes, I expect we can manage. See you at the club. Splendid. Now tell me, where's yours? Your what? Portrait. There wasn't time in the end. Well, I'm in digs here another week. Your man can do me a miniature, so I can take you with me, up the mountain. You can keep me warm at nights. What do you say to that? No chance. She's a fidget. She won't sit still. No, why not? I'm extremely flattered. Good. See? Mind of her own, after all. What's his name, this sable Leonardo? 
 
 (Locals chatter, dog barks) Did I ever tell you about a fellow from the old days... named Captain Hart. Hart? From the War? He was my commander. In the celebrated Mule Corps. Was he a good man? He shot my mules. It was the order. Better kill them than gift to the enemy. 41 brute beasts, as loyal as any soldier. (Market seller calls out in background) There was no time to bury them, so we burned them. And I wondered... .. why did they not run? Why stand there, waiting to be shot? Why? Because of me. No. I was there, you see. Standing beside him. Poor creatures. All I ask... .. is that our son should live the life that is for him. And when the world says to him, "Stop! We know what's best!" I want to shout, "Run! "Run for your life!" That's not fair. I know. I didn't raise him to marry that girl. I keep thinking... "What'll our family say?" "What'll all my cousins in Rustom Baug say?" Oh, I dare say we will be cast out of the fire temple, for a month or two. Are you sure he's fond of that girl? Quite sure. She's not even especially pretty. Oh? Such a long nose and thin lips. Well, we'll... just have to look at her feet. (He giggles, she joins in) Miss Whelan is expecting me. (Knock on door) Yes? Mr Dalal is here to see you. Yes. Tell him I'll be down in a minute. You remember my sister? Shamshad! How nice. Can I play your piano? Yes, of course. Do you like music? They force me to have lessons. With a Mrs Gool. She hits me with a stick. Look... Ow! Perhaps it's time you found a new teacher. I know, but Ma says I must have Mrs Gool because... Because Mrs Gool is a friend of the family. Shall we begin? (Shamshad begins to play a tune) Where shall I sit? As you wish. Very well. I'll sit here. No. Not there. There's too much light. I won't be able to see. And Captain Farquhar will have wasted a shilling. Ah! Thank you. Just put it down. Do you have a photograph, Miss Whelan? What? A photograph. I can draw just as well from that and there is no need for you to be sitting indoors. No. I'm afraid I've no photograph. I thought you'd be pleased. I thought you'd be pleased to see me. But I am not here for me. I am here for your friend, Captain Farquhar. Well, if you'd rather be somewhere else... My father is sick. I would rather be with him. Shall we start? Wait. I didn't know he was unwell. Why would anyone bother you if my father was ill? It's nothing. No! It's not nothing. Please, pack up your things. I'll arrange for... Really, there's no need. (Baby starts to wail) Percy. My son. And... his father? You mean, my husband? Your husband. Where is he now? Home. Home. He'll just be waking up. Slept through his alarm clock. Running late for his train. I realised... I didn't love him. I tried accepting it. I tried being unhappy. Other people seem to manage, don't they? So... I took my child... .. and got on a boat. And did you find what you were looking for? Yes. For a moment. Miss Whelan... Oh. I have heard of British men who take Indian wives or... .. mistresses. But never the other way round. I have a family. As you know. My father was invalided during the war. He's not strong enough to work. They depend on me. Without my salary... It's all right. You don't have to explain. I must be out of my mind. No! It can be our secret. Another one. Would you like to meet him? My son? Yes. I'll fetch him now. Come, let's go. Memsahib, baby is ready. Memsahib? Please, call me Alice. All : Pull! Pull! Pull! Go on! Go on! Go on! Come on, boys and girls! You can't let him win! Come on! Oh! (Cheering) Where's the golden boy? On his way from work. Well, that's what he told us. Who let that man through the gate? Mr Ian was invited to perform in the tug-of-war. The only thing he'll be invited to perform in is a hasty exit! Mr Mcleod! Afternoon... Out! Get him out! And tell him he's not welcome! Not welcome. Understand, Mr McLeod? Please, let me have a word with her. No. Thank you, Alice. But this is my fight. Not yours. Good day. (He knocks gently) (She protests) (She protests) (She cries out) What are you doing? What is he doing up there? It's a two-man job, this. He's helping. Aren't you? Is it safe? Crowbar... Erm... Where's the crowbar? Well, I'm not bringing it up. (She shouts in own language) Are you all right, love? Mummy... Isn't it silly? I used to be able to climb anything. Here... What's that? Nimbu pani. Lemonade. Anyway, I'm not thirsty. I'm stuck! Memsahib... Yes, what is it, Ayah? Rickshaw is waiting, for the club. We're missing it. We're missing the tug-of-war! Just have a sip. Ayah... Shall I cancel rickshaw, memsahib? Er, tell them... Wait! That's it. Oh...! Better? Yes! Yes! Off first thing? Yes. We got the all-clear from the Viceroy's office a week early. Anyone would think someone wanted to get rid of me. I'm sorry about the portrait. There was no time. You don't remember, do you? What? I came to your wedding. Left rather early. Under a bit of a cloud, I'm afraid. Anyway... Charlie, my old pal... .. your husband, who is very much alive, despite rumours to the contrary, heard I was coming out this way. He asked me to look in on you. How is he? Is he all right? He wants to know when you're coming home. Though, that's bound to change, I suppose, once I tell him the sort of life you're leading out here. What do you want? I see. Shh... Keep still. Anyway... .. you were all over me yesterday. So, why not grab me while you had the chance? Where's the fun when it's freely given, hm? Charlie spoke to a solicitor. The child belongs to his daddy, legally speaking. So, what you've done is, well, it's... .. it's sort of kidnap, apparently. I'm not afraid of you. Drink up, Farquhar. We're a man short for the tug-of-war. This way... You don't mind my joshing your little sister? Who, Alice? Who else? Not at all. (Cheering) Ralph, you're the captain! There's a chap taken ill on the back stairs! Oh, my God! Best we get him to hospital, memsahib. Yeah. No, no! Get hold of the horse chappie. He's had a few, but I dare say he can stitch. Any word from himself? I don't know where he is, memsahib. No. Well, he doesn't think he can be helped, that's the trouble. Go, go, go! Oh, there you are! I'm trying to... I need to track down your brother. The Prime Minister published his recommendation for the Indian constitution. Within the hour, 148 reserved seats for the Untouchables. Bloody nose for Congress, you wait! I'm sorry. I can't help. Excuse me. Who could be unhappy in such a place, huh? You can't stay. You can't. No. I know. Good. But tonight, I want you to finally meet your son. Yes. About time. Ralph? Hello, darling! What are you doing out there? I... What have you got there? Creme de menthe. Want one? Why not? Hard at work? Ma says I have to tell you sorry. Hm! A very humble apology. What are you...? For God's sake, Sooni! Sorry! I just don't know why it's you always get what you want. You think I have what I want? What, Head Clerk? Obviously! And if by some miracle I manage to stay on a horse for long enough to pass the examination, please spare a thought while you are off studying the law, following your dream at my expense! I didn't mean... I feel as though I am dead, Sooni! Or gathering dust in one of their damn files, marked green for non-immediate dispatch. And one day, I will wake up and say, "What about me?" "When is it my turn to choose?" And they will say, "No, it's too late for you. Do your duty." I was talking about Sita. So was I. Aafrin...? 'We are to be offered funds. 'I need you to make a thorough list of all the work, 'all that's needed to make the school safe for the rains.' (Cheering and shouting) Damp in the roof. Write it down. Now... The whole lot needs fixing. Water down the front. And the back. Fresh paint for the walls. Can you write that down? And the floors. The floors can be done as well. Adam, no! What do you want? Why will you not leave him in peace? He is my son! What? You don't have to go with her. You understand? Urgh! No! Go home... Mr McLeod, I owe you an explanation. You see, the... .. the thief took an article that was very dear to me. It was Kavitha's. My late wife's. It was... .. her wedding sari. Your wife? When did she pass away? Shall we eat? I want you to know that woman will never threaten you again. Do you understand? Leaving already? Yes. Under a cloud. Another one. Give my regards to your brother. With pleasure. Goodbye. Oh... Did you write to Charlie? Not yet. What are you going to say to him? You tell me. Say I'm not ready. Not yet. I have some things that I have to work out. Please. Poor b*st*rd. For you... I've no use for it. What is it? Leonardo. I'd have shaken him by the hand, but they wouldn't let him through the gate. Thank you. Oh, easy... (They exchange farewells) Good night. Mr McLeod, wait. Let me fetch someone to walk you home. Aye, there's no need! I am eminently capable! See? Good night. Be safe. You came! (She screams) (Scream) Hello?! The past always catches up with you. That's what people say isn't it? Are you suggesting Sita betrayed me? I trust Sita with my life. Whereas, I am not to be trusted? No, you are not. A handbag?! Gandhi goes on hunger strike, while we drink and dine and laugh. I will hear no more about it. Sir. Your father, what is his name? You don't have any idea what you've just done. Ralph, you have to get a handle on this. And quick!
