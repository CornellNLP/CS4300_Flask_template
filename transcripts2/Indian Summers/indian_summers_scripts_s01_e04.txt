 Argh! You dirty pish! 
 It says you owe him money. 
 Bloody Indian damn near killed him. 
 Madeleine is not the problem. He's losing interest. 
 Pleasure to meet you, in such different circumstances. 
 Her name is Alice Whelan. 
 Wouldn't it be fun to find out what she's hiding? 
 Who is that boy? 
 Adam. 
 Found in the lining of his bag. 
 Certificate of membership of the Congress of India. 
 That man with the gun had nothing to do with the party. 
 This is British propaganda. 
 You are British propaganda! 
 Oh...! 
 Whelan! 
 Where is he? 
 So much the better. We'll surprise him. 
 Mr Ralph, sahib... 
 The Viceroy? Why's he coming here? Why would he do that? 
 Lat sahib wishes to see you after so many weeks. 
 Yes, well, better inform the syce, in case he wants to ride. 
 The horse-keeper is up and waiting. 
 Yes. And coffee. 
 That bitter Nilgiris stuff he likes to drink and complain about. 
 Did they ask where I was, on the telephone? 
 I said you are in church, sahib. 
 In church? 
 Christ! He'll enjoy that. 
 Ralph! 
 Gene... 
 I wrote you a note. 
 You want to read it? 
 Look. Why don't you just tell me what's in it? 
 All right. 
 My dear Ralph, words cannot convey. 
 Health, as you see, back in the pink. 
 We're going home now. 
 You look done in. Why don't you get some rest and we can talk about it over supper? 
 Too late. 
 Train departs today at four o'clock. 
 And Madeleine? Does she have a say in any of this? 
 Don't be so coy, my dear fellow. You've had your fun. 
 Jesus Christ, I have to knock twice before I walk through every goddamn door in the house! 
 What are your intentions, because Madeleine is a high prize. 
 Gene... 
 Honey, say farewell to our host. 
 What? 
 Madeleine, would you talk some sense into your brother? 
 Whelan! 
 Mr Ralph, sahib... 
 Pack your things. We leave for Chicago. 
 Today. Unless you have something to say to her? 
 Stop it. Stop it! He's being ridiculous. 
 Do you have something to say to my sister? 
 Don't answer that. 
 Jesus! 
 What has gotten into you? 
 Whelan! Where are you hiding? 
 I wish you a safe passage. 
 What? 
 Couldn't get the car up the bloody road! 
 Your Excellency. 
 My boy. 
 We've wasted enough time here already. 
 How was London? The meeting? 
 Plenty of time for all that. 
 Now, you can get your chap, if he'd like to get up, to bring me some of that dreadful South Indian coffee you enjoy so much. 
 You've met Captain Percy, haven't you? 
 Help! 
 What on earth is going on? 
 Some men just delivered. Here. 
 For the little rajah in his undershirt. 
 What is it? Maybe you shouldn't touch it. 
 Oh...! 
 Old books! 
 Hints On Riding. 
 A History Of Common Law. 
 Baapi, let me see that. 
 Oh, Aafrin. It's revision for your ICS exam in the winter. 
 Oh, here's a letter. 
 Let me see! 
 No! 
 It's for your brother. 
 Ma, why don't you open it for me? 
 Oh, well, if you insist. 
 "From Mr Ralph Whelan." 
 "Praemonitus praemunitus." 
 Praemonitus praemunitus. 
 Forewarned is forearmed. 
 It's a proverb. 
 "With best wishes for your swift recovery. 
 "Ralph." 
 Oh, God... 
 Shh! 
 "Please present yourself at Viceregal Lodge for some... 
 ".. sport..." 
 What sport? 
 ".. later this afternoon." 
 Ah. 
 Sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry to drag you away, sir. 
 The report into our death in custody, from the coroner's office, sir. 
 Chandru Mohan? 
 Yes. 
 "We cannot know for certain the precise motives for the assault on Mr Whelan's life. Mohan appears to have acted alone. His motives are unclear. Nor can we ascertain his mental state at the time of the shooting." 
 So, lone gunman, possibly insane. 
 If we hadn't lost the blasted evidence, the proof, there in black and white, to tie the terrorist to Congress. 
 Lost? Or taken? 
 Well, there's the rub, sir. 
 Have you drawn up the list of the people who were there that day? 
 When would be convenient for us to conduct the search, sir? 
 I have an idea. 
 What's this one? 
 [i](Replies in hindi) 
 I'm going to ask Miss Alice over tomorrow. Nothing fancy, just a light tea, if you could be in. 
 Of course. 
 Happy to. 
 Good. 
 What's this one? 
 Ah, here he is. 
 Oh, my boy... 
 Uncle. 
 He refused to go anywhere until you arrived. 
 You need to get me home to Fife. 
 You understand? 
 Not here... 
 Come on, come on, it's all right. 
 When I think, 
 40 years in this goddamn stinking pit. 
 My whole stinking life. 
 Now, don't make a fuss. 
 Come on. It's all arranged. 
 Sister Margaret here has very kindly volunteered to take you all the way to Southampton. 
 And she won't stand for any of your nonsense, you dirty dog. 
 Come on... 
 That's it. 
 I mean it. You get back. I'm not one for fare-thee-wells. 
 Cheerie-bye. 
 Goodbye, Uncle. 
 Say hello to Scotland for me. 
 You'll look after my gardens for me, won't you? 
 Keep them safe, till I come back, eh? 
 Yes. Yes, I will. 
 You promise? 
 Aye, I promise. 
 Very well. 
 Nice and loose. 
 That's it. 
 Sir. 
 And let go. 
 Your shoulder. How unforgivably stupid of me. 
 It's perfectly fine, really. 
 I didn't see it. 
 Where did it go? 
 Not awfully far. 
 We've all got to start somewhere. 
 Mr Keane, sir, I think you are an expert golfer? 
 Oh, far from it. Far from it. 
 Fine shot, Mr Keane! 
 Dammit! 
 Screwed it again. 
 Ah, here he is. 
 What is this? 
 The Viceroy of India. Deep breath. 
 Your Excellency, might I present Mr Aafrin Dalal? 
 Any man who stands before a bullet, I think can look me in the eye, don't you? 
 He has the look of a teacher. 
 Mr Whelan's very own munshi. 
 So much the better, Mr Dalal. 
 We need all the education we can get. 
 Shot, sir! 
 Well hit! 
 There's no great science. Just hit it! 
 I promised I'd ask... 
 You see, my spies tell me there's a young lady on the scene. 
 Well, they're clearly better informed than I am. 
 Yes. 
 How old are you now? 
 30, sir. 
 Already? 
 My God! 
 You came to my birthday tea, if you remember? 
 So I did. 
 Still, 30 years... 
 A serious age. 
 Perhaps you'd like to meet her? 
 There is no time for this. 
 We have a train to catch. 
 Here, let me help. 
 No. 
 I'm not going to be bullied into rushing. 
 Get your hands off! 
 Listen to me! 
 Don't you see? 
 He's sampled the wares, he's not buying. 
 Aren't you smart, Eugene? 
 He's using you and the minute he gets tired or bored... 
 Well, maybe I don't f*cking care. 
 You know? 
 Maybe I like it. 
 Perfect. 
 'I'm getting together a supper party tomorrow night, just a few friends.' 
 The Viceroy among them. 
 I was hoping you might be persuaded to stay on one more night, as a sort of hostess. 
 I don't think this is such a good idea. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This morning, your brother, he caught me on the hop. 
 But, you see, the Viceroy did ask especially to meet you. 
 You told him about me? 
 Yes. Oh, should I not have? 
 Oh, no, I... 
 I'm glad. 
 Don't go. 
 I couldn't stand it. 
 [i](Train whistle) 
 You know, I think that might be your train. 
 Yeah. 
 There's no great science to it. 
 No moving, Sahib. 
 Nice loose grip, and swing. 
 Definitely, it's high time this fellow got a new suit. 
 It's just a small supper party, very informal. 
 Then wear daddy's pyjamas. They're informal. 
 So he spoke to you directly? The Viceroy himself? 
 At some length he spoke to me. 
 What did he say? 
 Naturally, he asked all about you, Ma. 
 Oh, really? 
 Of course! What subject more fitting than his own mother? 
 Hands off! And what did you say? 
 He simply said... 
 TOGETHER: "I only wish to do my duty." 
 Ssh! 
 Can I get down now? 
 You hardly ate. 
 Oh, go on. 
 Nice to see you, Miss Alice. 
 You too, Matthew. 
 You know what he came out with today? 
 Why can't I go to daddy's school? 
 Really? 
 I see you're not rushing in to condemn it. 
 No, I mean, it would be an adjustment, certainly... 
 An... Is that what you call it? 
 No, no. He's real English. 
 He needs to be back home, at an English school with English children, not a lot of blackie-whites you picked up from... God knows where, some of them. 
 Miss Whelan, tell me. 
 What was your experience? 
 Well, I was sent home, yes, I'd have been eight. 
 And? You didn't feel displaced? 
 She had her brother with her. 
 In the holidays. 
 There, see? She was quite secure. 
 Well, surely, your mother? Father? 
 You missed them and they missed you, but you were home - and that's the point. 
 Home, yes, that's what we all called it, though I can't say, to be honest, it ever felt that way. 
 Everyone said I would love it, of course. 
 "Like a warm bath," my mother used to say. 
 The reality was more of a cold shower. 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 Any child of mine has the right to know there's more than... this. 
 Did you ask your son? What does he want? 
 Oh, that's a rich question, coming from you. 
 Sarah. 
 Forgive me. 
 I should... 
 Why don't I walk you home? 
 Thank you very much. 
 They gave you a fair hearing? 
 Oh, yes. 
 The Prime Minister made himself briefly available. 
 [i](Laughter) 
 So, this summer, we have to show the world we're committed to reform. 
 The Provincial Assemblies? They're back on the table? 
 Indeed. Whitehall are drawing up a framework for democracy. 
 I told the India Office, they need a man at this end. 
 You have someone in mind? 
 Oh, Whelan, no coyness, for crying out loud, man. 
 Now look, we're going to want reserved quotas, for the minorities, so that all the nations of India might be represented, not just the damned Hindu nationalists, but the Muslims and the Sikhs and so on. 
 So everyone has a voice. 
 The Untouchables? The Depressed Classes? 
 They still want their own political representation? 
 Yes, but... Gandhi's dead against. He wants all Hindus marching under one flag. 
 His own? 
 That's all he cares about. Strength in numbers. 
 It did cross my mind. 
 The Untouchables' leader, Dr Ambedkar, he caused quite a stir at the conference last year. 
 He has no love of Gandhi. 
 Invite them up. 
 There's no harm in making overtures. 
 The Prophet of Peace presumes to speak for all India. 
 Let's see if we can't break things up a bit, hmm? 
 Good thinking, sir. 
 Now, what about this heiress of yours? 
 Alice. 
 What would you do if you had a friend, and you discovered that friend was telling an untruth. Do you let the lie stand and carry on as if you know nothing? Become part of the lie, if you like. 
 Sorry, I'm not making myself clear at all. Say this friend shows up, child in tow, tells anyone who cares to ask that she's a widow, when in reality... 
 Wait, I'm sorry... 
 What have you heard? 
 The man you married is alive, and fit. And you just simply took yourself off. With the child. And your husband came home to an empty house. 
 What will you do? 
 If word somehow got out... You know, a covenanted civilian like your brother the heaven-born. 
 We do expect higher things over here. 
 What do you want? 
 To help, silly. 
 
 
 
 Look at him. 
 He's laughing at us. 
 Not a bruise on him. 
 While your poor uncle... 
 I honestly don't know what's happening to this world. 
 But there's such a thing as laws in this country and they're not just for Indians. 
 We're going to fight this. 
 We're going to get your land back. 
 Aye, too right. 
 B. 
 B. 
 C. 
 [i](Animal noises) 
 C. 
 [i](Something smashes) 
 It's OK, it's just monkeys. 
 [i](Dog barks) 
 [i](Branch snaps) 
 Who was that? 
 [i](Period background music) 
 Where is she? 
 Just charm him, like you charmed me. 
 Perhaps rein it in just a fraction. 
 For instance, don't grab him in the library. 
 Shall we? 
 Your Excellency. 
 Now - which is which? 
 Allow me to present my sister Alice. 
 Enchanted. Yes. 
 And Miss Madeleine Mathers. 
 Your Excellency. 
 Up, up, up! 
 Of course we've heard all about the pair of you. 
 Well, I can't think why. 
 One tends to keep an eye on young Whelan. 
 My wife Marie calls him her special case, you see. 
 Well, he's er... certainly that. 
 Ooh! 
 Sir - a drink. 
 We have Mr Ronnie Keane right here. 
 [i](Tropical birdsong) 
 Oh, no... 
 Dalal. 
 Ah! Munshi! 
 Christ! Did somebody die? 
 [i](He laughs) 
 [i](He laughs) 
 Very glad you made it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 What will you have? 
 Ahem! 
 Your uncle - on his way home, I hear. 
 I had no wish to see him hurt. 
 Don't you fear. 
 I'll be off your land by morning. 
 As agreed. 
 If that is what you wish. 
 What I wish doesnae come into it. 
 Sir. 
 You trapped my uncle in a debt and... here's your reward. 
 I came to make you an offer, but... if you do not wish to hear it. 
 What could YOU possibly offer me? 
 So your family's in industry? 
 Steel. 
 Oh, Mathers, yes - of course. 
 So your father got out all right, before the crash? 
 So I believe. 
 He was lucky enough to see it coming. 
 Ooh. Clever chap. 
 How's the fowl? 
 Yes. Very tender. Thank you. 
 Don't eat that. 
 Bhupi. Another bird for our guest. 
 Sahib. 
 Ralph, I think your man has taken against Mr Dalal. 
 No, no. 
 I'm sure that's not the case. 
 Mr Dalal saved his master's life. 
 How could anyone ever compete with such perfect loyalty? 
 But it wasn't my intention. 
 I acted entirely without thinking. 
 [i](They laugh) 
 [i](She clears throat) 
 Mr Dalal, your family is from the Punjab? 
 From Bombay. 
 Well, originally, we are from Persia. 
 But we fled to India many centuries ago. 
 Parsis. Sound business sense. 
 Excuse me a moment. 
 Something I'd like a word about. 
 Of course. 
 Later. 
 How many houses on the list? 
 Do you think this is the famous raid? 
 Raid? Of what? 
 Some evidence conveniently disappeared just before the inquest into our blundering assassin. 
 Evidence of what? 
 Who knows? 
 He's got it into his head someone is plotting against him. 
 So he asks a friend of mine to make a list. 
 Anyone who was in the Coroner's Office the day the evidence went missing. 
 Quite a number of us are here tonight. 
 This is coincidence? 
 While we feast like kings, the Superintendent will be popping round our houses, looking under the mattress. 
 Plundering the landlady's skirts. 
 They are searching for this... 
 Yes... evidence. 
 Apologies. 
 I say, that looks well-travelled. 
 That's our great-great uncle Charlie. 
 Murdered in Cawnpore, in the Mutiny. 
 My God, am I the only Englishman left in India who doesn't have an ancestor martyred in '57? 
 [i](They laugh) 
 One moment, please. 
 Ah - I'm so sorry. 
 Mr Dalal. Are you lost? 
 Forgive me, Miss Whelan. 
 What's the matter? 
 Do you remember, the night I was shot? 
 Yes, of course. How could I forget? 
 I lost hope. 
 And do you remember, you took my hand? 
 Yes. 
 Again I am in your hands. 
 What have you done? 
 I have a message. 
 It is imperative it reaches my sister Sooni - at once - tonight. 
 Please! Don't read it. 
 I hardly dare ask. 
 All right. 
 I have an acquaintance. 
 If you give it to her - do you know St Leonard's church? 
 The cemetery, above Portmore. 
 Yes. 
 Memsahib? 
 Ah, Bhupi. Mr Dalal felt unwell. 
 He's better now. Aren't you? 
 Very good. 
 Dalal! Thank God! Do you sing, man? 
 No better than I swing the club. 
 Jessie's Dream. I expect you've heard it. 
 It's The Relief Of Lucknow, with a bit more thigh. 
 You can be the murderous sepoys - you don't do much - and it saves me having to black up for once. Hey! 
 Wait, wait, Mr Dalal sent me. 
 Aafrin? 
 Yes. 
 Sorry, I ran all the way. 
 He's not hurt? 
 No, not this time. 
 What do you want? 
 Take this. Get it to his sister, as quick as you can. 
 I can't go to his house. 
 They hate me, he knows this. 
 It's important. 
 Captain Codrington. 
 What's your name? 
 Sita.

 [i](Laughter)

 I think we all deserve another drink. 
 Marvellous. 
 Thank you very much, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Come and sit down. 
 You first. 
 So, I saw Ramu Sood. 
 I rode straight over. 
 He made me an offer. 
 Stay on, as manager of my uncle's estate, making Armitage tea, just as before. 
 But the land is still his? 
 Aye, but I'll be running it, that's the point. 
 As that man's subordinate. 
 That is the point. 
 Look, I know you're still something of a griffin in these parts but this is not how we do things. 
 Is that clear, Mr McLeod? 
 So... 
 What's your news? 
 There was a telegram. 
 Your uncle. 
 On the train? 
 I'm so very sorry. 
 Come here. 
 Kaiser, get some brandy. 
 So, you see? Your Mr Sood is now a murderer. 
 Gerard? 
 Vehicle's ready when you are, sir. 
 Glad to be back. 
 London's too much for me nowadays. 
 There's a beggar on every street corner. 
 And they don't seem to care for us any more. 
 Our own people. 
 There's no fight, no optimism. 
 There you go. 
 They want us out of here. 
 I told 'em, too bloody bad. 
 Good night, sir. 
 Yes, good night. 
 You're a good man, Whelan. 
 Just like your father. 
 Sir? Who is Gerard? 
 Hmm? 
 He called you Gerard. 
 Did he? 
 Yes, Gerard, his eldest son. 
 I'm afraid he died in the war. 
 Sir, what was it you wished to ask me? 
 Sahib. 
 Wait there. 
 [i](Whispering) 
 Shall we go in? 
 After you. 
 Sit, please. 
 So, the question I meant to ask... 
 Sir, I... 
 No, me first, Aafrin. 
 May I call you Aafrin? 
 Of course, sir. 
 Good. 
 I find I'm in need of a second opinion. 
 Are you ill, sir? 
 Er, no. 
 You see, I was looking at your damn picture. 
 You've caught a likeness. Everyone says so. 
 And it got me to thinking. 
 What did you see? 
 In her? 
 Sir? 
 Well... 
 Miss Mathers is a very fine woman. 
 I am hardly experienced. 
 It's not experience I'm after. 
 It's instinct. I want your instinct. 
 And for God's sake, don't ask me what I think, or feel because the simple truth is, I don't know. 
 But I... 
 What? 
 Well, I assumed there was some problem, sir, with Mr Rowntree. 
 Well, there was. 
 He was after something that was lost and regrettably, he drew a blank. 
 I'm very sorry to hear that, sir. 
 Don't avoid the question. 
 It's a straightforward proposition. 
 Do I send her home or do I marry her? 
 But why do you ask me? 
 You saved my life. 
 Cold? 
 Who cares? 
 What...? 
 What is it you wanted to ask? 
 [i](He gasps) 
 Prepare to eat cake! 
 You're getting married! 
 You are fond of the girl? Ralph? 
 Your Mr Whelan, I can trust him? As a Britisher? 
 You're very welcome. 
 Hindus play by their own rules, we keep our noses out of it. 
 King Emperor! 
 You'll always be here for me, won't you? 
 You were tricking me into acting against my own brother? 
 My life is not your life! 
 Do you have any idea the pressure I am now under?
