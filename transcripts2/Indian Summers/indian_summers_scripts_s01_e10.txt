 Look at him. He's laughing at us. 
 Mr Sood, on the charge of murder, I find you guilty. 
 If the British will not give up swaraj, we will have to take it by force. 
 Will you help us? 
 No, that is impossible. 
 Nothing is impossible. 
 Is this what he'll remember? 
 My little boy, when he's a grown-up? 
 His daddy, and a sea of little black faces... and that creature. 
 There are one or two bursaries at my old school in Hertfordshire. 
 And if I were to put in a word... 
 It's a big step. 
 It's whatever's best for Matthew. 
 Jaya said the worst person was a woman. 
 You knew she was pregnant, and you wrote to the old men in the village and you told them! 
 Can't you see that I'm here to stop you falling down and hurting yourself? 
 Get off, get off! 
 No! 
 Good luck paying for the wedding. 
 Your fiancee you're so fond of - they're all flat broke! 
 The colour bar at the British Club. 
 "No Dogs or Indians." The Nawab was most offended, sir. 
 Because of the Club? 
 Yes. Because of the Club. 
 Memsahib. 
 I love you. I know I don't say it enough. 
 You never said it at all! 
 I'm saying it now. 
 It's all right, Ralph will help us. 
 No, no-one can help us. 
 Aafrin's got himself a little English missy! 
 Be quiet. 
 Bhupi! 
 Here, sahib. 
 I remember you. 
 You used to pull my hair. 
 Sir, what can I do? 
 This one might be out of your league, old friend. 
 A gift from my husband, sahib. 
 Where did you get it, Bhupi? 
 The bazaar. 
 Where did you get the bracelet, Bhupinder? 
 There was a dozen of them. 
 Terrorists from the gutters of East Bengal. 
 Overpowered the sentry. 
 Set about burning down the European Club with everyone in it. 
 We returned fire, but one of the wives was killed. 
 Shot through the chest. 
 What if the army hadn't got there in time? 
 Try not to think about it. 
 No - you have to think about it. You have a duty - we all do... 
 We think we know these people. We live among them, we have them in our houses. 
 It gives me no pleasure to say it, but... 
 But why the Club? 
 Sorry, old girl? 
 In Chittagong. Why did these terrorists attack the Club? 
 Oh. They took umbrage at the colour bar, you see. 
 And the sign: "No Indians and dogs" et cetera. 
 But couldn't we just take down the sign at the gate? 
 Wouldn't that be enough? 
 My first thought. 
 However, the Viceroy wrote to me in person and he's of the opinion what's needed... 
 How did he put it? 
 .. is a "slightly stronger message". 
 But it's not fair. 
 It's where we come for a drink and to get away from it all. 
 Rowntree. 
 Are we all ready? 
 Everyone got your chits? Share pencils if need be. 
 I hope they hang him. 
 They do what, darling? 
 That nigger in the prison. It's barbaric, slaughtering some poor, innocent woman just because she took a dress. 
 The date is 4th of October, 1932. 
 One question on the agenda: a simple aye or nay. 
 In sorrow, not in anger, do the members here present consent to lift the colour bar at the Royal Simla Club? 
 Come. 
 Let them get on with their business. 
 We were all managing quite nicely, until... 
 How long is she intending to stay? 
 Do we know? 
 Who, Memsahib? 
 The sister. Miss Alice. 
 Late night? 
 Excuse me. 
 (Man clears his throat, the room goes quiet) 
 Come on. Who wants a taste of the firing squad? 
 Dalal? 
 Not me, sir. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Man outside room : And it's... Tate coming in from the Vauxhall end. Ooh! 
 Oh! Almost caught behind. 
 Right, that's it, back to packing. 
 How are we getting on? 
 Sir. These letters. I don't quite follow... 
 Oh, I think they're pretty clear. 
 In this one, here we are, "In the case of the convicted "murderer Mr Ramu Sood of Kangra District, the Viceroy recommends the sentence be commuted from death by hanging to life imprisonment." 
 And this one? 
 Let him hang. 
 So... So which do we send? 
 Officially, the Viceroy was in such a hurry to get back to New Delhi last Tuesday that this small bit of business slipped through the net. 
 And unofficially? 
 Unofficially, his lady wife, Marie, favours mercy. 
 But Willingdon prefers the old iron fist. 
 Let the punishment stand. 
 Show the buggers we're not to be trifled with. 
 So, all in all, much better to hand the whole headache over to yours truly. 
 What will you do? 
 I don't know. I haven't decided yet. 
 What would you do? 
 I... Sir, I don't know if I could take a life. 
 Other people do that. I just have to post a letter. 
 Where's that Chuprassey? 
 Just outside, sir. 
 Let me know if he runs off, would you? 
 Get Bhupinder to give you a hand, if you like. 
 Do you grow much chikoo fruit in Fife, Mr Ian? 
 This I will really miss. 
 You won't miss them, cos you're not going anywhere. I told you, they're reviewing the sentence. 
 No, my date is fixed - those people are against me. 
 You've a few friends yet, Mr Ramu. 
 Would you like one? 
 Stomach's all shot. I cannae keep anything down nowadays. 
 Try rind of pomegranate, mixed with buttermilk. 
 Really? Who did you hear that off? 
 My saas. Mother to my late wife, Kavitha. 
 I should have stuck to growing fruit, as she wisely advised. 
 Tea never brought me anything but grief. 
 You were too good at it that's your trouble. 
 Then that's how you should remember me. 
 It's a wee bit early for deathbed speeches. 
 "Ramu Sood!" you will cry, as you scatter my ashes. 
 I'll toss 'em straight in the rubbish if you keep this up. 
 And I would cheer you on, Mr Ian, but Kavitha wouldn't stand for it, she was a superstitious soul. 
 Are you going to shut your mouth or am I shutting it for you? 
 Ramu Sood! Ramu Sood! 
 Ramu Sood! 
 RIGHT you b*st*rd! 
 Ramu Sood! 
 Hanged by the District Court! 
 Not if I kill you first! 
 No, no, no, no! We were joking! 
 Mr Ian! 
 I'm going to get you out of here! 
 Thank you. 
 See? All your favourite things. 
 (She cries) 
 That's enough waterworks. If you can't control yourself, please go indoors. 
 Tuck in, love. 
 Anyway, it's all booked. 
 Did I tell you the Mclellands and the Rowses are travelling with us right up to Tilbury? 
 Yes, you did. 
 And Shirley says she'll try and sneak us up to the upper-deck. 
 We might meet the Captain. You'd like that, wouldn't you? 
 And Auntie Ellen says we can stay with her for a couple of days, that'll be nice. 
 She's got it all planned. We'll do Big Ben. 
 We'll do the Tower of London. 
 Son... 
 Here, give me that. Grown man, can't butter his own scone. 
 No, it's all right. 
 I'll have to get used to doing things by myself now, won't I? 
 Oh. I expect you'll get help. 
 Come on. Shall we go? They'll be needing Daddy back at the mission. 
 Up you come! 
 No. Let him finish his cake, at least. 
 Sit down. 
 Goodbye, young man. 
 Goodbye, Daddy. 
 Write to me. 
 Well - all aboard! 
 Say goodbye, at least. 
 I just wanted to say... no matter what happens, you're still my wife. 
 Always will be. 
 I know. And I promise you I won't forget it. 
 Mummy, we're going to miss it. 
 Coming! 
 Is that it? 
 Speech over. 
 I wish I could have given you what you needed... 
 You did. Once or twice. 
 You just never knew it. 
 You'll come back, both of you? 
 Next summer? 
 I don't know. We'll have to see. 
 Say "Goodbye, Daddy". Driver! 
 Goodbye, Daddy! 
 Goodbye. 
 (Melancholy piano music plays) 
 Ah, Kaiser. 
 Parliament has spoken. 
 Memsahib? 
 The members' votes are in. 
 They are. 
 Heard from Ralph? 
 No. Not today. 
 They're all getting invites to the grand wedding, did you hear? 
 No. 
 Where would you hear that? 
 (Piano music stops) 
 Come on, play something. Cheer us all up. 
 (Jaunty piano music plays) 
 I never hurt anyone. 
 We just try to do what we think is best, don't we? 
 Just wish he was here... so I could tell him. 
 (She slurps) 
 England. 
 Children : England. 
 Scotland. 
 Children : Scotland. 
 Wales. 
 Children : Wales. 
 (Axe chops wood) 
 Children : Scotland. 
 S-C-O-T... 
 L-A-N-D! 
 (Axe chops wood) 
 Mr Raworth. 
 Mr Whelan. 
 I thought you were back in Delhi. 
 We set off the day after tomorrow. 
 Wedding next month, perhaps you heard? 
 Sarah... she kept her ear to the ground. 
 Look. 
 Something wrong? 
 Nothing wrong. No. 
 You're here to see the boy, I suppose. 
 The boy? 
 Adam. 
 Why would I do that? 
 I don't believe it. 
 You can't even say it, can you? 
 Say what, old chap? 
 Rakshas. He's yours, isn't he? 
 Yes. My son. Yes, I suppose he is. 
 Well, don't tell me. Tell him! 
 He already knows. 
 Still, he might like to hear you say it. 
 Thank you for your advice. 
 Well, what is it you want? Why are you actually here? 
 I, erm... 
 For too long, I've let myself be led by other people - that old woman at the Club, she was a friend of the family, you see - but I'm done with her now. 
 Done with her. 
 I want things to be different - 
 I want to know, erm... is he all right? 
 Adam? Is he... settled? 
 Well, the nightmares roll on, but we're used to that. 
 He hurts himself, stabs himself with a pin, actually, or anything else he can lay his hands on. 
 His mother made him do it. 
 But he's putting that behind him now. So, yes, settled, I would say so. 
 You're not going to make this very easy for me, are you? 
 Perhaps I'm not in the mood. 
 I've only just got off saying goodbye to my own son. 
 Big day. 
 Yes. 
 But it's what Mrs Raworth wants? 
 Well, who knows what she wants? 
 It was all a big misunderstanding, you see. 
 My heart's in this place. 
 She was never interested. 
 I should have been clearer with her. 
 But who does that? 
 You try and be the man you think they want. 
 Whatever that is. 
 They'll be wondering when you're coming in. 
 (Axe chops wood) 
 We're in for a cold snap, clearly. 
 Your assistant, what's her name? 
 Leena. 
 Does she know your wife's off home? 
 She does. 
 Well, if all parties are happy, where's the harm? 
 (Train chugs) 
 And once more, over the page. 
 How are we doing? 
 Almost finished, Miss Mathers. 
 Look on the bright side - we've made more decisions in the past hour than we have done with the whole rest of the summer combined. 
 This is the famous honeymoon dress? 
 Do we like? 
 Do we have a choice? 
 Do we wish to live? 
 What is it - silk? 
 What else? 
 To be honest, I just want to grab a hold of it and rip... 
 Oh, thank Christ for that - since he's paying for it. 
 (He coughs) 
 Excuse me, I will come back in the morning... 
 Don't move. 
 Are you all right? 
 Sure. 
 I won't be long. I promise. 
 Don't be. 
 Hmm... do you remember, sir? 
 The "Memorandum on the Mas Dam Project." How could I forget? 
 I don't believe it. 
 Six months up and down the country and the outcome is still pending? 
 Look at this. 
 Every scribe from Sind to Simla must have had a crack at this poor, benighted file. 
 Khazagi Raj in action, sir. 
 An ocean of ink. 
 Shall we sign it, sir? Get this blasted project underway at last. 
 HE CHUCKLES So we shall. 
 This calls for a toast. Where's my, erm...? 
 Ah, on the veranda, sir. 
 Bhupi! 
 Where's the damn fellow? 
 There's no need for fuss. I will fetch it. 
 Don't be silly! 
 Sir, I insist. 
 (Baby gurgles) 
 Amma! 
 Amma! 
 (She yells in Hindi) 
 (He speaks Hindi) 
 (Man chokes) Bhupinder! (He chokes) Help! Help! HELP! In here, sir! Arri! Arri! Get a knife! Don't come in! Ah... (Ralph grunts) What about the doctor? He's all right now. We'll send someone over in the morning. Come... But why would he? W-Why did he? Who knows? Let me see if I can find out. All right? It's all right. Go ahead. (Ralph laughs gently) You see, Bhupi and I are old friends. His father was in our service. Grandfather before that. We were born, oh, weeks apart. He joined in all our games. Escaping from the compound... chai in the bazaar in those little clay cups they had. And then one day, our fathers took us each to one side and said, "No more." But we knew better than that, didn't we? Oh, yes, old friends. The most loyal fellow in the world. (Bhupi sobs quietly) (Speaks in native language) You...? No questions. Who? Who did? What happened here? I want you to know that I never asked him to. It never even entered my mind he would do such a thing. But why would he...? He was... Well, who knows? He was... acquainted with her? No. Then... You? Jaya... I don't know where to begin. Can I trust you? As a friend? Yes. I was very young at the time. It was all over such a long time ago. I suppose it was his way of... From what she could do? You'll sleep in the house tonight. You too. What is it? (He speaks own language) Yes, but we have to forget it now. We have to forget it and go on. (Very quietly.) Or it will be hard for me. Do you understand? Good. (Ralph speaks native language) Sir, what can we do? Oh, he'll bounce back quicker than you think. I mean with regard to Mr Ramu Sood. Oh, I see. Why, what do you suggest? Well, is there not some way to offer him clemency now? Yes, and what then? And then, in a year or two, perhaps, he may be granted early release. On some technicality, it's not beyond the wit of man. If the right people were involved. Yes, good thinking. Thank you, sir. Shall we send it now? Send...? The letter, sir. Yes, most certainly, send the letter. I'll run it over myself what do you say? An excellent plan, sir. Well, that's settled. Munshi. You'll teach me to do better. How can I? Too late, you already have. Not a word about any of this to my sister. Swear to me. I swear. You'll take the spare room. (Door opens) (Creaking) What will I do, in Delhi? What we can. When we can. But I was thinking. If there was somewhere we could go... here... England? I can't go back. Not yet. My husband is already threatening to take my son away. Then, here, in India. But... We could tell your brother. Ralph? Why not? You've changed your tune. That's not what you were saying before. I... see another side to him. Perhaps you're right. You see, there's this boy at the mission school. For a while now, I've... What? Nothing. Go on. (No. Doesn't matter. Forget it.) Hello? Bhupinder. Sahib? (Aafrin speaks own language) Sahib left for district court, some three hours ago. (His breathing grows) (Quicker and louder) No! (Papers echo on impact) (Cell door slams) No! No, Ramu! Ramu! Be strong. Be strong! Be strong! There must be something we can do, there must be something we can do... They can't do this! I told 'em you di... I told 'em he didn't do it! (Swallows twitter) Bystanders : ♪ Vande mataram ♪ 
♪ Vande mataram ♪ 
♪ Sujalam suphulam ♪ 
♪ Malayaja shitalam... ♪ I don't know the words. I'm sorry, I don't know the words! ♪..mataram. ♪ (Trap door clunks) (Silence) 
 
 (Camera shutter clicks) (He whimpers) (She sobs) Wow! (Genteel applause) (Faint chatter) Not like that. Like this. Two hands. Swish, swish. Let me show you. Swish, swish. Swish. Good lad. Are we decent? Is that Ralph? Hm. Only me, I'm afraid. What's that you're feeding her? Rice congee, sahib. Cures all ills, apparently. Want some? No, thank you. I have a horror of any sort of broth. Swallows out in force. Well... they'll be off on their travels. Just like home. You'll be on your way, won't you? Yes. First thing tomorrow. We're all hoping for the usual send-off. Oh, yeah. We'll be ready, won't we, Kaiser? As always, memsahib. Then I'll just keep the bar open at weekends. At least till the snows set in. Hm. I expect you've got something for me, haven't you? A-hem! Just a lot of unpronounceable names. They're all local men. Natives. Natives, yes. Each of good, sober character and keen to adopt our own social customs. Well, they sound very dull to me. So much the better. We won't even notice them. I'll notice them, all right. I'm sorry, no. They're not coming in. Cynthia. As Club Secretary, it galls me more than anyone, but the membership voted unanimously, on the advice of His Excellency, the Viceroy. S-Sorry! Is he sitting down, or standing up? I can hardly tell. I beg your pardon?! If you think that old Willingdon did this, you're even more feeble-minded than I gave you credit for. Of course it was Lord Willingdon. He had a word with me himself. Oh, jolly good, Mr Parrot. And who had a word with him? Never mind. (She sighs) (Why do I waste my breath?) I went to the hanging today. I thought it might do me good. Did it? It's funny, I've forgotten. It's a strangely colourless business. A bit like your broth. And then you get home and you... you think about all the people you've ever known. The big and the small, the good and the bad. Black and the white. And just for one moment, it's like... they're all the same. Well, I'm not sorry I missed it. One. One native. That's the condition. One local member as a token of our goodwill going forward? Call it what you like. Any preference as to who? No? Right. Jolly good. One last favour. Another one? This wedding, back in Delhi. Old Whelan and Clara Bow. Yes? Dear old Ralph, head like a sieve, he's gone and forgotten to stick my name on the ruddy guest list. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. I was wondering, I'd be eternally grateful if you'd give him a nudge. He won't be able to say no, will he, if it comes from you? Leave it with me. Eternally grateful. I knew I could count on you. (Hubbub) Wash them all. Put them all in the water. Aafrin? Aafrin! (Shh-shh-shh-shh! He's revising, poor thing.) I hate you in your stupid suit! You should have seen it! You should have seen it. It was like watching an animal! You could have stopped it! I don't know who you are. You're a coward! Worse than nothing! You are not my brother! You are not my brother! (He sobs) Sooni, please! (He sobs) Why did you not save him?! I tried! I thought I had. So, what happened?! Aafrin! What is going on? Oh, God, this house! Letter for the fat prince. HE SIGHS Have you been blubbering? Shut up, you brat! You have! Ma, Sooni is crying over a man and this is his letter. Oh, Shamshad, please! Sooni, what are you crying about? Huh? (I don't believe it.) What? Read. What does it say? Nothing. It says nothing. Read it out, Sooni. They want him to join their stupid club. What? What? Here. Where is he now? Eh?! Where'd you put him?! The Indian's remains have been incinerated and will be disposed of as His Majesty sees fit. Oh His Majesty's on his way over now, is he? Look, that fellow lost the right to a decent send-off as soon as he murdered that poor woman. That's it? What? No. Mr McLeod. Put that down. No chance. That box is the property of the Government of India. Let's go! Sergeant, stop that man! Don't touch me! Give me the box! Er... no. Stop this lunacy! I've no wish to charge you, Mr McLeod. No. This is not what he wanted. Give me the box, Mr McLeod. (He sighs) Get away from me! Go after him! (Hubbub) Excuse me! So sorry! Look at him run. When did you last see a man run like that, Mr Dalal? I will work for you. For your people. Naturally. What choice do you have? I have a choice. But this is the right thing to do. Mr Singh! Sahib! You will give me proof. I give you and Miss Ayer my word. What can I possibly give? Something from Mr Whelan. What?! How can I...? Where is he now? Heading up towards Scandal Point. Christ! What's he going there for? May I ask, sahib, what was in the box? Oh just bone ash for my poor roses. But the point is, he thinks it's his friend Ramu Sood! So as far as the world goes, it might as well be Ramu sodding Sood. Shall I run and detain him, sir? No, not yet. I don't want some god-awful scene. Not if we can avoid it. Not on the last night of the summer! (Shh!) Here. Let me. She's my wife. And I made her a promise. But we have work to do. And these children need us. And we will work and do what we can, the two of us. And we'll raise these children to lead such lives... I hope God can forgive us for what we've done in the past. It's all I ever wanted. Well, then. (Music plays) (Low chatter) Excuse me. Sir? Mr Dalal. Not more files? No, not today. Aafrin doesn't need a reason to call. Mr Dalal. In fact, perfect timing. Everyone, here, charge your glasses. Bhupi, one more for our friend. What are we celebrating? Our last night in the hills? Of course. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. You, too, Bhupi. Just a sip. No, thank you, sahib. Excuse me, I'll just get my shawl. It's all right, Bhupi, I think I can manage. Is everything all right? She's tired. Excuse me. Of course. Wait! Darling? (Talk to him.) (Now.) Sorry about that. I'm fine! Look, er... Well, as a matter of fact, Aafrin, we have something we want to tell my brother... don't we? Sounds very solemn. Don't tell me, you've been painting the Vicereine in her bloomers? No. Not quite. Sir, I'm a little embarrassed. You see, I left something in the house this morning. Oh, really? Yes, an old pen belonging to my father. And now he's a little upset... Bhupi? Anyone see a pen this morning? No pen, sahib. What colour was it? Please, don't go to any trouble. I know where I left it. Very good. Excuse me. What a fuss. Yes. Shall we give him a hand? You go. (Rakshas!) Aafrin? I have it! I left a box of papers here this morning. Look, Aafrin, um... Sir. This business with, er... Sood. You see, Willingdon was quite determined, and... No, you deserve better than that. Sood was becoming a lightning rod for all sorts of other discontents, which, although he played no part in them personally... You wish to close the book. To end it, yes. I understand, sir. You do? Perfectly. Well, thank God! Yes, thank God for that. My dear friend. All set for the ICS exams? I revise when I can, sir. When do they start? Nine weeks today. Nine weeks. No time to waste. Not a minute, sir. I tell you... it breaks my heart to leave this house. It will still be here, waiting for you in the spring. Yes, so it will. I'm coming, slow down! Slow down. (She speaks in Hindi) Mr McLeod! Ah! Miss Whelan! Off to the club as usual? Well, last night of the season and all that. And I'm off to say bye to a dear friend of mine. Do I know him? Know him? Aye, perhaps you do. He's right here... He got his neck broke this morning. That's Ramu Sood? Aye. Right, let's go. But where are you going? I don't know myself! Come with us if you like. Wait! Mr McLeod! Do you know, I don't think he's coming. Relief all round. Still. Bloody cheek. He's not obliged to come. Probably got a better offer. Never! Erm, would somebody please inform my piano wallah that, if he would care to finish his dinner, we might even have a little sing-along. (Applause) Shall we? Come this way, sahib, follow me. You're late. What are they doing? They're here for you. What did I do? You're more famous than you know. Hello. Hello. Hello. Dalal! The letter, sir. Ralph Whelan. Rakshas! Well? What do you think? Are we up to snuff? You look very distinguished. Good. If you're quite sure I'm eligible? As club member, I am entitled to one guest. I'll sign you in. Good. Sign, please. Show me. A token. Baapi? I say, Cynthia? Cynth! What is it, darling? He's here. The Parsi. (She snorts) Cheek of the thing. They're not used to us, that's all. Come. What'll it be? Scotch and soda? Very good. Excuse me, bearer, Scotch and soda, er, twice, please. What's he doing now? Excuse me, my friend - two whiskeys with a little soda, if you'd be so kind. Don't you know anything? Only members may buy drinks. Martini? Oh, I see. Aafrin? Yes. Your old man seems to have blundered. Would you mind ordering the drinks? Two whisky and sodas, please. Excuse me? Allow me. How very kind. Whisky sodas. Scotch or Irish? Scotch, naturally. Scotch? You'll have half my family turning in their graves. Mr Keane, may I present my father? Darius Dalal, sir. You've been in the wars. Yes, sir. He fought at Gallipoli. In which case, allow me to introduce Captain Turner. You'll have to speak up, he's a little deaf. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. I don't know what to say. Yes, you do. Final warning, Mr McLeod! Give me back that box! For the love of God, hasn't that man done you enough damage? Almost! But not quite! All right, pal. Here lies Ramu Sood. I was proud to work for you as your employee I was proud to call you my friend. Ian McLeod, I'm arresting you for the theft of government property. Hanged by the District Court for a murder he never committed, because he was too damn good! Crowd : Ramu Sood! Ramu Sood! Sergeant! What's got into them? Why aren't they doing as they're told? The men are afraid, sahib. Afraid? I'll teach 'em afraid - what's the matter with them? They do not wish to offend the dead, sir. They're offending me and I'm a-bloody-live! Just give them the order, dammit! Crowd : Ramu Sood! Ramu Sood! No, no - don't do that. Please, get up... She's praising you. Why? Who is she? His late wife's mother. What, Kavitha? Kavitha? Kavitha. Kavitha. Crowd : Ramu Sood! Ramu Sood! Ramu Sood! Ramu Sood! Good shot! I said, "good shot". Aafrin. Alice? I thought you weren't coming. You didn't tell him. Your brother? No, I didn't tell him. I thought we could trust him... but I was wrong. I know that now. I am certain of it. He is a dangerous man... Miss Whelan! We will find a way. I love you. I love you, too. We thought you were in purdah, Miss Whelan! Haven't you heard? Our lady's done a bunk! No-one's seen her anywhere. Oh, and which lady is that? Cynthia! Look who I found, Daphne! (Distant singing) It's my house. I really want to eat that. So many dishes, auntie! Not so many. Ow, ow, ow! (Children laugh) I've made a bit of a hash of it. Shall we? Heavenly father... we thank you for this joyous feast laid at our table. You'll be seeing a bit more of me from now on. ♪ 'Tis the tramp of soldiers true ♪ 
♪ In their uniforms so blue ♪ 
♪ I must say goodbye to you, Dolly Gray ♪ 
♪ Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you... ♪ My friends bet me 124 rupees I wouldn't dance with you. Well, I hope you are willing to share the winnings. No chance. Anyway, aren't I your reward? ♪ See the boys in blue are marching... ♪ Not like your brother to miss the last night. No, I know, he's been so busy with the wedding. As long as that's all it is. Why? What's your theory? No theory. Just so long as he's not got his nose out of joint over our new member. He's not that old-fashioned. Well, quite. Besides, Dalal's his head babu, isn't he? His munshi. Yes. May I just say, I'm so glad you've decided to stay on? You know, in the end, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. ♪ Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you. ♪ Oh! They can't do that. (She sobs) They can't do that. Can't. What are you doing out here? Oh, hello, sweetheart. So you made it after all. They're singing my song. It's MY song... and they're singing it. Come on, up you get. No, no. I am perfectly fine. I hear it's all change at the Club. Oh, you'd know all about that, because you tipped off old Willingdon, didn't you? Please don't lie to me. Yes. Oh... I was angry. (She sighs) Well, I expect I deserved it. Yes. So, you're going through with the wedding, then? Yes. Yes, we are. I am truly happy for you. Would you like to come? To the wedding? You sure you want me there, spoiling everything? You're all I've got. Yes, I am. Good point. Good thinking. Shall we? Oh, hang on a minute. Look all right, do I? My Ralph. Still here. Come on. But it's nearly over. I expect they can manage an encore.
