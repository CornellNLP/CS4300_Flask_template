 Summer's upon us, whether we like it or not. 
 I couldn't just leave him there. 
 What matters is what the world sees. 
 And that young woman will do very nicely. 
 (She moans) 
 Tell me to stop. 
 He is watching. 
 Rakshas! 
 (Gunshot) 
 Help! I'll take them in. 
 (Thank you.) 
 He was calling you "devil". 
Why would he do that? 
 What is it, Bhupi? 
 A gift from your brother! 
 Whoever for? 
 For you, Memsahib! 
 He went out... first thing. 
 Give him a couple more days. 
 I won't beg. 
 "To the Secretary of State for India, Westminster. My dear Samuel. As you may have heard, this year's summer administration got off to a bumpy start." 
 One way of putting it. 
 "The guilty man has been detained, and I am happy to report local morale here in Simla is as undaunted as ever. Our present duty is three-fold. To root out any and all accomplices. Second, constant vigilance against any further acts of terrorism. A sunset curfew on all natives, exempting those in private service. Redouble the guard in and around the British quarter." 
 Left, right, left... 
 Well, I don't feel very safe, do you? 
 Mmm. 
 Should we offer them some nimboo pani before they blow something up? 
 "Finally, renew our vigour in stifling the nationalist mob wherever it presents itself." 
 No? 
 Bit more clout? 
 Right. 
 As in...? 
 No more compromise. 
 Meet fire with fire, until Mr Gandhi and the rest of congress are subdued. 
 Too strong? 
 Because I rely on you to rein me in, if I'm being too tiresome. 
 Not at all. Fire with fire. 
Just what they need. 
 Well, if you're happy, have it wired over to the Viceroy, would you? 
 Very good, old love. 
 Who is that man? 
 And remember, not a word to Daddy about all this. 
 You swear to me? 
 I swear, Ma. "His poor nerves." 
 You already told me a thousand times. 
 Anything about Aafrin in it? 
 No, it's fine. 
 Thank God. All right, good, let's go. Let's go. 
 Here you go, Daddy. 
 Oh, at long last. 
 And where is your mami? 
 She went out. 
 And Aafrin? Aafrin! 
 I told you. 
 He had to go out of station for a few days. 
 But how can he do that? 
His slippers are here. 
 Would he not be more comfortable at the Ripon, with his own people? 
 (He cries out) 
 The Parsi, Mr Dalal, is he all right? 
 Oh, I haven't heard. Why do you ask? 
 I wrote to the surgeon to enquire. 
 Obviously, I'm just wasting everyone's time... 
 (She plays random chords and notes) 
 Do you really play? 
 God, no. I never had the time. 
 You? 
 No! No, these things are strictly ornament. 
 What's the point of it? 
 No point. It's just your brother being absurdly extravagant. 
 Let's go out. 
 We kind of promised that we wouldn't... 
 Oh, rubbish. There are no more terrorists hiding in hedges. 
 Sarah : Of course we know the way. 
 Oh, no. 
 Coo-ee! 
 I hope we're not intruding! 
You got my visiting card? 
 Of course, what fun! 
 It's even better than you said in your letters. 
 Well, I'm not one to brag. 
 And this land is all yours? 
 No, no... Another fellow owns this stretch. 
 Was he at the club? 
 Good God, I should hope not, no. 
 He's a local chap, but... 
 Local? 
 Native. 
 Really? They can do that? 
 Oh, they do as they please, nowadays. 
 We put him up here, where we can keep an eye on him. 
 I don't think he's likely to run off with your spoons. 
 Shh! But I thought he was improving. 
 Yes, but I'm afraid there are signs of bacterial infection, probably from scraps of his undershirt. 
 His sudreh? 
 It's made of sacred thread. 
 Indeed? Well, it's embedded in the wound. 
 Of course, if his clothes hadn't been so filthy... 
 Filthy? 
 Please. 
 How is he? 
 Tell her I don't know her. 
 (She speaks hindi) 
 Of course it's of the greatest interest to our readers at the Delhi Herald. 
 A shooting, in broad daylight, under the Viceroy's nose... 
 It was evening. And the Viceroy is not here at present. 
 He has been detained in London. 
 Really? May one ask why? 
 Look, I'm overdue at the Council of State, I'm afraid. 
 Shall we say three o'clock? 
 The man who tried to shoot you. Did you know him? 
 No. 
 Do they know his name? 
 Not yet. 
 I gather he's refusing to speak. 
 Really? Might I have a word with the district superintendent? 
 You hardly need my permission. 
 Still. I wish to make the most of my visit, Mr Ralph, sir. 
 I meant to ask, how did you hear about this whole business? 
 Oh, I had a note, from one of your own people. 
 A Mr Ronnie Keane? 
 Who put you up to this? 
 Nobody put me up to this. 
 Need I remind you who fished you out of that godforsaken syphilitic hole in the mofussil? 
 I can just as well shove you back if you work against me. 
 I'm not! I'm not working against - Christ, Ralph, some chap from the Delhi Tribune... 
 The Herald. 
 Herald - quite right - he sent me a telegram asking was it true, such and such a date, a man was charged with the attempted shooting of a member of the Indian Civil Service. 
 So you asked him up? 
 Course I did. 
 I thought to myself, we need to look lively, or they'll turn this terrorist into another Bhagat bloody Singh. 
 They'll be writing bloody songs about him next. 
 Sahib. 
 Ek minute, Bhupi. 
 Besides... An interview with the Herald. 
 It's your chance to shine, ain't it? 
 Don't be charming. 
 Ah, that's better. 
 You know, old love, for a moment there, I wasn't quite sure who I was talking to. 
 Forgive me. 
 Anyway, we've nothing to fear from Mr Khan. 
 His uncle's master of hounds with the Delhi Royal Hunt. 
 Well, that is reassuring. 
 Oh. 
 What's this? 
 Hospital fees for your stricken Parsi. 
 Well, can't we farm it out to the Board of Revenue? 
 I'll have a word. 
 Lucky for you - him bumping into that bullet. 
 Yes. Not so lucky for him. 
 (He chuckles) 
 As I said, the man won't speak. 
 But if he won't speak, how do you know the shot at Mr Whelan was politically motivated? 
 Ah, well, when we apprehended him, he was wearing this. 
 A cap... 
 A Gandhi cap. Prohibited under the emergency laws. Of course... 
 Mr Rowntree, sir, these caps have been worn for centuries for no other purpose than to keep the sun off our heads. 
 Like your topi. 
 Only... less practical. 
 Forgive me. 
 What is it? 
 Inside the stitching. 
 So there is... What is it? 
 Identity card. Full marks, Mr Singh. 
 His name? 
 Chandru Mohan. 
 (Children laugh and chant) 
 Adam? 
 Where is Adam? 
 Not again. 
 Come on, children, come! 
 Where are we going, auntie? 
 To find him, of course. Come. 
 Well, if that won't break them, I suppose nothing will. 
 (Voice chuckles) 
 I'm afraid I helped myself. 
 Oh, Mr Mathers! You feeling brighter? 
 Oh, much. But obviously I'm in... 
 (He groans) 
 .. no state to travel. 
 I should hope not. Plenty of rest. That's the ticket. 
 How's that sister of yours? Active? 
 Madeleine is not the problem. 
 He's losing interest. 
 Oh. 
 I feared as much. 
 'News, as promised. A party of officers from Fort St George is setting out to discover what we can of the prisoner's background. He's from a village in the Madras Presidency. We believe his name is Chandru Mohan.' 
 And? 
 From Miss Cynthia, at the Club. 
 Sir? What can I do? 
 This one might be out of your league, old friend. 
 (In Hindi): Let him wait. 
 Well, what do you think? 
 Oh... 
 Splendid. 
 It's a sight for sore eyes, eh? 
 The... other workers. 
 Where are they? 
 Oh. Tiffin, I expect. 
 Aye. 
 Of course, we'll be able to keep more of an eye on them, now I've got reinforcements. 
 You like that, don't you, eh? 
 They like a bit of discipline, oh, yes. 
 Sir, who's that man? 
 What does he want now? 
 Sir? 
 Our neighbour. 
 The native? That's him? 
 Aye. 
 You tell him from me, next time I catch him wandering on my land, I'll have him skinned. 
 Hello. 
 Look here, this is not a public highway. 
 I insist that you make an appointment. 
 Ramu Sood. Pleased to make your acquaintance. 
 Yes. I... 
 I know who you are. 
 Hand this letter over to your uncle, please. 
 Good day, sir. 
 (Piano keys sound) 
 My old man tuned pianos, organs, in every church and hall in the whole of... 
 West Riding, yes. I'm sure they don't want to hear. 
 Again, please. 
 You really don't need to help. 
 Will you be taking over the accounts? 
 What I tend to do, I buy in bulk, so you're not caught short, if a visitor happens to pop in. 
 I expect Miss Whelan will have her own ideas. 
 Of course, he thinks every meal is put on his plate by order of a higher power. 
 Why don't you let Alice play us something? 
 As I say, I really don't play. 
 Course you don't. 
 And who is this? 
 Family portrait. 
 So that must be... 
 Ralphie.  (they laugh)  So it is! No pictures of your late husband? 
 I expect she left them at home. 
 Much healthier, don't you think, to leave it all behind? 
 Well, honestly, I'm no expert. 
 Who's this? 
 Shepherdess. It's a Staffordshire. Please, take it. 
 Oh, no, I couldn't. 
 Here. I'll wrap it up for you. 
 No, no, I couldn't. Douglas. 
 There. It's done. It's a gift. 
 Message, sahib. 
 Well... 
 I don't know what to say. 
 There's been a small emergency at the school. 
 One of the children has gone missing. I'm so sorry. 
 Stay. You will stay. 
 A day or two with your family won't kill you. 
 Excuse me. I need some air. 
 Sorry, ma'am. Mahl Road is not possible - sahib say no ladies are allowed to leave the house. 
 I just want to go for half an hour. 
 If memsahib wishes, you can go up and down the lane? 
 Memsahib does not wish to go up and down the lane. 
 (She speaks hindi) 
 Please - we go? Now. 
 Yes, please, this way. 
 Adam! 
 (Children call in distance) 
 Adam! 
 Adam! 
 Adam! 
 Adam! 
 Leena-auntie! Leena-auntie! 
 Dougie? You saw him? 
 No, auntie. 
 He cannot come. Doesn't matter. 
 Children, come! 
 Ruth. You will please take them home. 
 We can't have you all wandering off during curfew. 
 What is wrong with their faces? 
 Cherries, auntie. 
 Cherries. Go on. Go home. 
 Adam! 
 Heaven! What are these? 
 What do they call 'em? Roller skates? 
 And people actually go about like this? 
 Who knows? 
 (She sighs) 
 Piccadilly Circus. 
 Auntie May promised to take me, before the crossing. 
 We spent so long in the ticket office there was no time at the end. 
 What are you writing? 
 Sermon. 
 Oh. 
 What's it on this time? 
 Duty. 
 To God, I suppose. 
 Or do wives get a look in? 
 It's one and the same thing. 
 Oh. 
 He's willing to share you, is he? 
 Yes. 
 And what if I can't? 
 What if I want you to myself? 
 Half past three. 
 We could go over, if you like. 
 30 minutes I have been waiting 
 
 
 
 (in Hindi) : 
 (Dogs bark) 
 (Voices shout birds call) 
 (Baby cries) Sorry. I am sick and tired of living in this filthy place. We are good, clean people. Yeah. Good, clean people who happen to live in a cowshed. I know. It's not easy for any one of us, this shifting quarters. Ah, Santosh! Chess! I... I'm so sorry, I wasn't sure of your address, I came empty-handed. So much the better. Our hands are empty, but our hearts are full, isn't that so? Yes. I don't know. I... Tea? Sooni... No, absolutely not, I was just... Oh, stuff and nonsense we just prepared. Shamshad - cup, saucer. It's really not necessary. And get the doily for the tray. The what? It's in the drawer in the guest room. We don't have a guest room. Please, sit. Sit. So sorry for the chaos, but we are having a spring clean. This is my wife, Roshana. 
My daughter, Sooni, and... Yes, we met, so briefly. Yes. I only wanted to know if there's anything I can do. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Come. Come. (He wails and sobs) He didn't know. No. Daddy has a weak heart. (Sobbing continues) How stupid of me. Please. We're in a bit of a hole. What on earth are we going to do? I ever tell you, Reggie had a fancy to grow an orchard? Oh, he was quite a farmer. He had the seeds sent over from a cousin in Derby. He planted six Allington apple trees, all in a line. He used to stand admiring them from the road to Mashobra. They choked up one harvest, then they all died and I thought, apple brandy, which I keep, all bottled up and on the shelf. Bit like my Ralph. Cheers. Mmm. It tastes of England. Mmm. That's right. England. Drowned in sugar... (Cynthia laughs) Ah... I hear he's not talking... No. They have his name. Ah... I wish you'd come to me sooner. Hm. You could've saved yourself a lot of fuss and unpleasantness. Let's put a stop to this. I'll get Kaiser onto it. (Indistinct) Play something. I don't play. I'm sorry. (Ralph sings gently) ♪ Drink to me only with thine eyes ♪ ♪ And I will... ♪ .. something, something. You played and I sang. And Father, he sat in that chair, he gave us watered down wine, not that we wanted it. I'm sorry, I can't play. I've no use for it. Get lessons, if you like. I don't want lessons. Why didn't you just ask me first? Why do you have to know everything? Force of habit. (Alice plays the piano softly) I gather you had the missionary's wife to tea. Well, she invited herself. And you gave her? A lemonade? A figurine. Yes. You do know we get constant begging letters from the husband? His school is chronically underfunded. We were going to advance them something, but now, we can't possibly give him a penny. Why not? Because the minute we do, everyone will say it's because you and the wife are friends. We're not. Hmm! I saw you, by the way. In the bazaar. (Alice plays the piano) What? Nothing. Forget it. (Alice hits the piano keys) Where are you going? Adam! (Sound of crickets) (She breathes heavily) (Adam grunts repeatedly) Stop. Stop it! Stop it. Give me that! Oh, my boy. (Cheering and applause) They look like kings. (Gentle applause) Kings of what? Absolutely splendid. I'm proud of you. (Horses neigh) Hard luck. Yes, bad luck. Congratulations. Alice, how lovely! We all got quite a fright, when you were taken ill this morning. Who's ill? Nobody. I feel much better now. Hello, Ralph. Madeleine. And Mrs, er... Raworth! Of course. Very well rode. Weren't you dizzy? Was it that obvious? (She laughs nervously) Shall we go inside? Come on. Drink for the victor. Oh, thank you very much. Jolly bad luck. You deserved to win. Didn't he? Oh, that's very kind of you to say so. How have you been? Didn't he? Let's get you home. Oh, yes. Bundle her home again. Lock her up. You might have said something. You can't go out, it's too late. The curfew, Daddy. Let them stop me. You're falling sick again, aren't you? I knew it, I knew it. I told you. Woman! It is my right to suffer with my son... whether you like it or not. (Roshana sobs) Shamshad! Daddy? Remove your mother, she is overcome. The whole afternoon I have wasted! I'm so sorry. The Private Secretary was called away. Mr Khan! Perhaps he wasn't a terrorist. In the absence of political motive, we must look for other motive. Perhaps the prisoner and Mr Whelan were acquainted? Rot. The prisoner hails from Madras Presidency where your Private Secretary served as Assistant Magistrate in the summer of 1923. I found it, in an old civil list... Mr Khan, do I have to remind you that under section four of the Emergency Press Act, the Government of India may punish... Any written incitement to violence, or indeed any other offence against government. Oh, we are all familiar with your section four, Mr Keane. But this time I will write the truth. What truth?! Where's he going now? To speak to the one man who knows. (He sighs) Music : Ragtime by Irving Berlin I believe it's called The Grizzly Bear. Really? They still do that? They do in this antique land. Well, they're doing it all wrong. Hey. What? No self-pity. Cardinal sin, remember? I remember. On your feet, sailor! Excuse me, I'm in the middle of a game. (Music drowns speech) Step. Hop, step, hop, step, back, and here we go. Grrr! This is all for your benefit. 
You do see that, don't you? What's this? Madeleine was unwell, on the way over and the ship's doctor happens to be an old friend. You stole Madeleine's doctor's notes? Not stole. Never steal. Acquired. Well, the brother's no derby winner, is he? So I thought it prudent to take a look at her plumbing and what not. And it's all just as it should be. If you think I'm reading this... Oh... Well, if you're going to be like that, I'm not going to tell you the best bit. Hey, all right, hey. OK... What? She lied. About her date of birth. (Cynthia whispers)  Other side. (Armitage grunts) Oh, yes. Oh, yes! (Madeleine laughs) Yes! Well... Oh! ..I say, good for her. Come on! (Ralph laughs) Hey! Ah! Sahib! I wish to meet the prisoner. He may speak to me if he wishes, he has THAT right at least. (Khan speaks in hindi) Chandru Mohan! Chandru Mohan! (Khan speaks in hindi) (Armitage shouts) (Khan speaks in hindi) Two, three... (Cynthia laughs) (Low pitched moaning and laughter) (Madeleine and armitage laugh) One, two... One, two, three, four... Hey... Whay! (Armitage laughs and applause) (Piano music resumes) (Chandru gurgles) (Chandru speaks indistinctly) (Distant sound of crickets) It's a filthy business, sir. I'm afraid he was a coward to the last. And he never spoke? Sergeant? Yes, sahib. He said it was... (He speaks in hindi) A matter of honour. Parsi. Sir? Mr Khan. Where is he? Has he set off already? Yes, sir. Might I have a moment? Absolutely, sir. My desk is entirely at your disposal. Thank you. Come on. Chop chop, Sergeant! 
Leave the man in peace. Aafrin. My boy. Problem? How did we miss this? (Men speak in urdu) Hands off! That man is our guest. Mr Whelan. They say I need a copy of my leave to enter, but I told the man I never had any such copy. Ridiculous. Mr Khan is trying to get out, not in. There's no reason to hold him a minute longer. Thank you. I'm so sorry. They've been a bit on edge, since the, er, incident. Well, thank you for your help. Now look, I meant to say, if you're still after a scoop... Thank you. I have my story. I'm sure you write like a dream, Mr Khan. But really, a dead man in a cell. The world's full of them. Only India. Still, some terrorist who'd rather take his own life than speak up for the cause. Hardly heroic, Mr Khan. We cannot say what he was. Or why he tried to kill you, Mr Whelan. As to that, perhaps I CAN help you. You wish for an interview? You've been avoiding me all day. Good God. I'm the last thing anyone needs over their tea and toast. Don't you think? No, I have something, someone, much more interesting in mind. Please. This man saved my life. We always look after our own, Mr Khan. Are you up to a few questions? Of course. (He clears his throat) You were shot? You took a bullet that was bound for this Englishman? This GRATEFUL Englishman. Who? Ah, what was his name? Chandru Mohan, from down in Madras. A terrorist. A member of congress, inevitably? (Knock at the door) Ah, cometh the hour. Here he is. Do you have it? I do, sahib. Found in the lining of his bag. A certificate of membership of the Congress Movement. For all their fine talk of peace, time and again, these campaigns of civil disobedience always turn to violence in the end, hmm? Didn't Gandhi himself talk about the "sacrifice of a million lives?" Tell me... what is it you remember? (Flashback of shouting) Rakshas!  (gunshot)  Rakshas! I only want to... to do my duty. Well said. Well said. (Distant gramophone music) Uncle? That letter... from the native... I wonder if I might read it? (Distant laughter) He says you owe him money. It's a final notice here. One week to repay. Seven lakhs of rupees. What is a, what is a lakh? (Armitage snores) 100,000 rupees, sir. This is business. And tonight, we are closed for business. Sahib. I had no idea you were a dancer. No. Well... you never asked. Forgive me, I... I had this, er... idea that we were, er... What? Something. We are... something. I got caught up in a work matter. But it's, it's all right now. Well... enjoy your bath. Come here. Please. Such pretty manners. 'My dearest Ellen, it's been ages since I last wrote. The new summer season is upon us. As ever, the whole family is pillar to post. Do you remember that bit of sleuthing you performed for me last May? Well, I have made a new acquaintance. Her name is Alice Whelan. She's so secretive on the subject of her late husband. Wouldn't it be fun to find out what she's hiding?' (Chanting and cheering) Come with me! You are not allowed! Sooni! You look queer. You're acting queer. Good day, Mr Armitage! Argh! Welcome to the Sipi fair! Pleasure to meet you in such different circumstances. Wake up, Aafrin! This is British propaganda. YOU are British propaganda.
