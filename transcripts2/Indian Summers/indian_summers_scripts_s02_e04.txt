 I heard a shot. 
 ( Gunshot ) 
 Another woman dead. And nobody cares to ask why. 
 It's about the house boy. 
 Adam? Is he my son? 
 Yes. Isn't it obvious? 
 Butter up the wife. 
 Promise nothing. 
 Miss Prasad? My lucky mascot! 
 I wrote to my wife about you, I said, "I've met the most delightful young woman." 
 Have you any idea what that man is doing to her? 
 Any fault here lies at your own door. 
 Leave her be. 
 ( Shouting and chanting ) 
 Aafrin, please! 
 Go! 
 Aafrin, look at me. 
 ( They shout and jeer ) 
 Aafrin. 
 I have to go. 
 Who is she? 
 Aafrin? 
 Aafrin! 
 What are you doing here? 
 What happened to Kaira Das? 
 You know what happened. 
 Shot by dacoits. 
 She was shot dead here, in Simla. 
 Two men led her into the woods. 
 And one of those men was you. 
 Have you lost your mind? 
 Here. See? 
 I found this in the spot where she was shot dead. 
 A heel from a shoe? 
 My God, Sooni, two years in law college and this is the best you can do? 
 So you deny it? 
 Deny what? 
 Under Secretary in the Home Department. 
 You're in the pocket of the police. 
 And Kaira Das, a firebrand, enemy of the administration, she was on some list. 
 Correct? 
 You think I killed her? 
 No, not you. 
 Aafrin-bhai would never soil his hands with actual blood. 
 I imagine you stood by. 
 You stood by and watched. 
 You are sick. You know what this is? 
 What? 
 You're jealous. 
 Oh, of course. Yes. 
 Stupid Sahib in his stupid office, with his stupid, stupid servants! 
 Tell me that I am wrong. 
 We'll soon find out. 
 ..the crown. I said, "That's all I've got." 
 Muddle! Woo-oo? Alice? 
 Yes? 
 Mr Hawthorne is speaking to you! 
 Oh! 
 She's been like this all day. 
 I'm sorry. World of my own. 
 Bit of a fuzzy head, I expect. 
 I was just saying, you'll miss her, no doubt. 
 And I feel guilty, stealing her away from under your nose, but you must blame providence. 
 You see, Anna, my daughter, well, her little governess has rather selfishly gone and got herself engaged, and I mentioned Miss Prasad when I wrote to my wife. Of course, she was very taken with the idea. 
 It's a bit exotic, isn't it? 
 A talking point for the other wives and so forth. 
 So it's decided? Leena has agreed? 
 Yes, she's very excited. 
 Well, why wouldn't she be? 
 Quite an opportunity for her. 
 As long as she's looked after properly. 
 House in London, country estate. 
 Oh, she'll have a high old time. 
 When do you leave? 
 Well, one or two things to tie up, but soon. 
 I see. 
 Though I shall be sorry to say goodbye. It's been glorious. 
 Ah! Ah! 
 Your Lordship. Here he is! 
 What a pleasant surprise. 
 I was on my way up to the club. 
 I'll walk you up. 
 Ah, well, I'll take my leave. 
 Bloody fashion parade. 
 This is her idea. 
 The American. 
 You think it will work, Memsahib? 
 Oh, Christ, no, it's ridiculous. 
 It's the very definition of a desperate measure. 
 Christ Almighty, you could spit through that. That's indecent. 
 And he's footing the bill for all this, Ralph is. 
 There's no talking to him. 
 Please tell me this is the last of it. 
 Give me strength. 
 Ralph, I'd back you at the risk of my own reputation. 
 I believe you're the right man to lead this country. 
 I believe your experience here could be an invaluable asset. 
 But I'm going back to London to convince a lot of old men, to whom you will seem absurdly young. 
 All I'm saying is, I'd sleep sounder in my bed if I had a few guarantees, you must understand that? 
 Of course. 
 Ah, Cynthia. 
 Greetings, gentlemen, ignore the mess. 
 What can I get you? Well... is it too early for whisky? Never! 
 Once the Maharajah tells me he's on board, I can go back to London with the news, with the hope and the expectation that the other stately princes will follow his lead. 
 What better start to your campaign at home, eh? 
 Splendid. 
 You'll find me on the veranda. 
 You've gone mad, you do realise that, don't you? 
 It's under control. 
 What happens when he finds out the Maharajah has rejected your invitation to come back, and is now, quite blatantly, ignoring you? 
 He'll be here. 
 Oh, you really think he's going to come back to watch old Phyllis in a bloody stupid fashion parade of all thing...? 
 Ooh, that's actually quite nice. 
 Her name's Sirene. 
 If you say so. 
 And she has the Maharajah wrapped around her little finger. 
 According to Madeleine, he'll do whatever she asks of him. 
 Well, let's hope Madeleine's right. 
 Too much? 
 Absolutely. Perfect. 
 You know, I am so glad you decided to stay on. 
 I'm so glad you convinced me. 
 Oh...I like this one. 
 I am pretty sure your husband will too. 
 He'll certainly like taking it off! 
 You wrote to him? 
 Oh, yes. 
 But, while I appreciate you including me in all this, Mads, I'm not sure it's something he should bother with. 
 It's a bit silly, isn't it? 
 Him coming back all this way just to see me prance around in a frock? 
 I did stress that in my letter. 
 I see. 
 But did he take a blind bit of notice? 
 Oh, so he's coming? 
 Yes, just got word. There's no stopping him, it seems. 
 He is obviously very devoted. 
 You're a lucky woman. 
 Oh, he's the lucky one, believe me, sweetheart. 
 You'll be glad to see him. 
 Not as glad as your husband will be. 
 I can't wait to see the look on their faces. 
 Cheers, gorgeous. 
 So the typeset has to be perfectly aligned so that you... 
 Mr Khan. Miss Dalal. 
 How may I help? 
 I have a story for your newspaper. 
 ( He sings gibberish ) 
 Oh, Sumitra! 
 I think it's time we had one of our little chats, don't you? 
 Yes, Sahib. 
 Well? 
 Her prince is coming. 
 Thank you, my dearest partner in greatness. 
 Hmm, stop that! 
 He says I'm his very own Lady Macbeth. 
 Oh, well, lost her marbles and topped herself in the end, didn't she? 
 So, have you chosen some dresses? 
 What? Me, model? 
 I don't think so, dear. 
 Don't be such a spoilsport, all the other girls are taking part. 
 It's a long time since I was a girl, Ralph. 
 Besides, I've too much to be getting on with. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me. 
 Come on, Percy. You're tired. 
 I don't want to. 
 I'm sorry, Mem... 
 What's wrong? 
 What's that? 
 My reward, he says. 
 Who says? I don't understand. 
 The Sahib, Mr Charlie. 
 Only, I can't keep it. 
 I do not want it. 
 Take it from me, please. 
 Your reward for what? 
 "Tell me where my wife goes... 
 "..who she speaks to," he says... 
 What have you told him? 
 Nothing, Mem. 
 I confess... I have lied to him. 
 Thank you. 
 You won't have to lie again. 
 You keep this money... you've earned it. 
 I thought we could walk the rest of the way. 
 As you wish. Shukriya. 
 They have made a start on the sketches already? 
 Aye, they've been at it a while. 
 You'll stay for a cup of tea, eh? 
 If it's not too much trouble. 
 Oh, tea is never in short supply around here! 
 Yes, you have plenty of tea and plenty of cow dung. 
 Well, it keeps the midges at bay. 
 I think I would rather be bitten. 
 Ajalaa, this is Sooni. 
 Sooni, Ajalaa. Lakshmi, you know. 
 ( They converse in own language ) 
 You mind if I have a wee look? 
 ( They speak own language ) 
 That's him. Naresh. 
 The man who was staying here. 
 Come. They'll be more comfortable if we're not hovering over them. 
 Where is Mr Khan? 
 Oh, stuck in his office. 
 But he assures me both pictures will appear in his newspaper so Naresh, and whoever murdered that woman, they'll have nowhere to hide. 
 That is good news. 
 Will you excuse me? 
 Sooni? 
 Here. 
 Shukriya, for your trouble. 
 They may return to their duties. 
 Good day! Wait! 
 Please tell Mr Khan I will call at his office today afternoon! 
 I really could do without this ridiculous fashion show today. 
 But no, no, no. 
 We must do our duty, I suppose. 
 Can't go upsetting our precious little sister-in-law. 
 I do find her irritating at times, don't you? 
 Perhaps it's the accent. 
 It does tend to grate. 
 What do you say? 
 She's irritating, isn't she? 
 She's just a tiny bit much at times. 
 She's very confident, that's all. 
 What, she's... 
 She's sure of herself, is that what you're saying? 
 Yes, I suppose so. 
 Well, why shouldn't she be? 
 She's an absolute peach. 
 She's a very elegant, charming woman. 
 Yes, of course. 
 Dear, oh, dear, is Muddle jealous? 
 Are you jealous? Bit jealous? 
 That's not very nice, now, is it? 
 You'll give yourself wrinkles with that frown. 
 Such a silly girl. 
 A witness saw two men coming through this wood. 
 I have to be at Gorton Castle... 
 This is what she saw. 
 Speak. Or so help me I... 
 You're working with the police? 
 Yes or no? 
 Say it for Ma's sake. 
 Or I swear to God you will see that face staring back at you in tomorrow's newspaper. 
 As you wish. 
 Sooni, wait! 
 Leave hold! 
 Don't you see? 
 Kaira Das was not my enemy. She was my friend. She was my comrade. 
 Comrade? 
 What are you talking about? 
 She was shot through the head, there, there on that spot. 
 And I was, I was... 
 Who killed her? 
 A man named Naresh Banerjee. 
 And what sort of a man is he? 
 A nationalist. 
 Not with Gandhi? 
 No. 
 Then what? A terrorist? 
 Not at first. But then, over time, he lost his way, he became... 
 But how do you... how do you...? 
 You were with him? 
 Weren't you? 
 Go on! Say something! 
 Yes. 
 Aafrin? 
 Day and night I am working to drive the British out... You? 
 How did this happen? 
 In Bengal. 
 No. Here, in Simla... you remember? The lies. 
 And when I saw you thrown into... 
 No! Don't you drag me into this. 
 How could you not tell me? 
 You don't think I didn't want to? 
 Sooni, don't you see? 
 All these years we were on the same side. No. Never. Never the same. 
 I spoke out. I spoke as I felt. 
 I didn't hurt anyone. 
 Nor did I! You hurt me. 
 You lied, and you lied, and you lied! 
 To you. Yes. 
 I only did what I felt was right! 
 No! 
 Don't say anything. 
 Nothing you could say could ever make any sense to me. 
 Brother. 
 ( Music plays ) 
 ( Knocking ) 
 Yes, come in. 
 Yes, I've had my arm twisted. 
 Someone had to add a bit of class to the proceedings. 
 What you got? A telegram? 
 Yes. For Madam Sirene. 
 Oh, give it here, then. 
 And her name is Phyllis. 
 Phyllis? 
 Yes. 
 Do try and remember. 
 Can't hear myself think. 
 Don't mind me! 
 I only live here! 
 Oh, is that for the Maharajah? 
 Nice. 
 ( Knocking ) 
 In I come! I'm not interested. 
 Cover yourself up! 
 What's this? 
 My apologies, opened in error. 
 Such a shame. 
 My husband's a very important man, Mrs Coffin. These things happen. 
 Yeah, but still, all this trouble, all this fuss, only for him not to show up. 
 Poor old Madeleine, you see, she believed you when you told her you had some influence. 
 I mean, now she knows you don't, so I think you'll find your new friend has considerably less time for you. 
 You're quite the bitch, aren't you, Cynthia? 
 Well, bitch or no, I'm myself. 
 I'm not living in a lie. 
 I'm not going around pretending to be someone else. 
 Aren't you? 
 The all-singing all-dancing, wisecracking, Queen of the club. 
 Do you wanna know what I think? 
 I think underneath it all you're just a bitter, lonely, little woman. 
 I pity you. 
 Tell me, what do you plan to do when he finally tosses you aside... and all this comes to an end? 
 Which it will. 
 Oh, it will. 
 I don't think I'm the one to be pitied here. 
 Very impressive, Mr Khan. 
 
 
 
 Hello? 
 Ah, here she is. I see you two are the best of friends. 
 Well, naturally... 
 I wouldn't go that far. 
 You have it? The portrait? 
 No. There will be no need for any of that. 
 But this was your idea! 
 I'm planning to run the story. See? 
 Page four. I have a great empty hole on the upper half. 
 That's your epitaph right there, Mr Khan. No. 
 There will be no story. 
 And who are you to counsel me on the content of my paper? 
 I spoke to my brother. Really? 
 What has your brother to do with any of this? 
 The matter is currently being investigated by the IPI. 
 Our involvement will only confound things. 
 If you print these allegations, the tea-picker, Lakshmi, will be detained and the newspaper shut down under the... 
 Yes...um...? 
 What is it? 
 The Emergency Powers Press Act. 
 I am simply trying to protect your business. 
 Good day, Mr Khan. 
 Good day to you, Sooni. 
 But... 
 What is it? 
 I was doing this all for you. 
 There was no need. 
 Well, I must confess, I am surprised. Whatever for? 
 I had you down as a fighter. 
 So I am. 
 But not today. 
 Sooni! 
 I saw the picture. 
 It was your brother, was it not? 
 Did you know? I suspected. 
 Tell me he didn't shoot that woman. 
 No. She was killed by Naresh Banerjee. They were all comrades. 
 And Aafrin? Who's he working for? 
 Who's side is he on? 
 His own side. As he always was. 
 Come on, Sooni. 
 He claims he is fighting the British but in a way that is senseless. 
 Repeat this to no-one. 
 As you wish. 
 And I am not in your debt for this, I hope that is understood. 
 Of course. 
 Good. 
 Sooni! 
 Banerjee must be caught for what he did to that woman. 
 We cannot let the crime pass. 
 You tell him. 
 Yes. I will. 
 Have you been smoking? Yes. 
 I'll tell Ma. 
 Be my guest. Ma! 
 Ah, Bhupi! 
 Quite the delegation! 
 Where are you going? 
 Memsahib, she says we are to bring these articles up to the Club. 
 Good! Adam, could you give us a moment? 
 Yes, Sahib. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 I am well. 
 You're drinking again. 
 I thought you'd packed all that in. 
 I swear, I have not touched a single drop of liquor these three days past. 
 Then what is it? 
 Come on. Spit it out! 
 I see her. 
 See who? 
 The woman. 
 What woman? 
 The woman in the river. 
 The woman I killed... Ssssh! 
 For God's sake, man! 
 Since that boy is coming to this house. 
 All the time, she is everywhere... 
 That's enough. 
 Do you see her too? 
 Now, look, you give me this, you go and get some rest, and we'll say no more about it. 
 But, Sahib, I wish to come. 
 No, no, no. Adam will fill in. 
 All right? 
 Bhupi had to excuse himself... 
 I've just given her the telegram. 
 He's not coming. 
 I mean, seriously, to put your trust into a woman that's, well, let's face it, little more than a prostitute, well, I'm not quite sure what your wife was thinking of... 
 This pleases you, doesn't it? 
 Of course not, it's a disaster. 
 Let me help you fix this. 
 I'll deal with it myself. 
 Has the Maharajah arrived? 
 No. And he's not planning to. 
 Between you and I, Aafrin, whole thing's a bloody mess. 
 We don't appear to be very high on his lists of priorities. 
 This hold-up in Amritpur, I understand it was most unexpected. 
 He sends his apologies. 
 That's not good enough. 
 Now, thank you all for coming to this, the Royal Simla Club's first fashion parade. 
 And the last! 
 Very possibly. 
 I can't wait forever, Ralph. 
 I appreciate that, sir... 
 So if the Maharajah won't come to us, we shall have to go to him. 
 I assume you can at least arrange that? 
 Of course. 
 Good. 
 You can give me the details tomorrow. 
 Tonight we are going to treat you ladies to a feast of gorgeous frocks, frills and flounces. 
 But don't worry, gentlemen, there'll be plenty for you to look at too... if you get my meaning. 
 Whelan, off to put your dress on?! 
 What the hell happened? 
 What do you mean? 
 You said it was in hand. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 What good is that? 
 I look like a fool, that's what Hawthorne will report back to London, that I am a fool, a joke, not to be trusted, not to be taken seriously. 
 Trouble in paradise. Oh, dear. 
 Well, first up, would you please give a warm welcome to the delightful Mrs Whelan! 
 I'm sorry. I know I let you down. 
 Mrs Whelan? 
 Your audience awaits. 
 Come on, the suspense is killing us. 
 Golly! Worth the wait. 
 What a start. So elegant. 
 Beautiful. 
 We're going to need a stiff drink. 
 Or a lie down. 
 We've only just started! 
 Yes, a warm round of applause for Mrs Whelan. 
 Next up, you can see various straps and some support. 
 Ah, Miss Leena Prasad. 
 What a dusky beauty she is. 
 As you can see, it does all sorts of things somewhere north of the knee... 
 Next up, Miss Daphne Meridan. 
 And as you can see we have... What is this? 
 "New season resort wear". 
 In some exotic print. 
 Blimey! 
 Probably for the best His Highness, the Maharajah whats-his-chops didn't make it. I can't see him approving of all this. 
 It's all just a little bit tasteless. 
 Now, ladies, dressed in a fanciful floral get-up, Mrs Stella Knox-Barr. 
 I mean, I'd eat my lunch if you were involved in this tosh. 
 Evening wear, captivating, day or night. 
 That's it. 
 Deep breaths. 
 You too, Captain Turner(!) 
 Excuse me. Alice? 
 I won't be long. 
 Al? What are you doing? 
 One of my fuzzy heads, I expect. 
 Uh-oh. Here comes trouble. 
 No introduction needed, I think. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, here she is at last. 
 Be still, my beating heart! 
 Yes, as demure as any debutante. 
 Our own Queen of the Hills, ladies and gentlemen, Queen of the Hills! 
 Marry me, Cynthia! 
 Do I owe you money or something? 
 I have no words, ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes. 
 Now, in a late but very welcome addition to our show, Mrs Havistock. 
 Delicious. Lovely. 
 Downright gorgeous. 
 Am I dreaming, ladies and gentlemen, is this Simla, or the Silver Screen? 
 All looks thoroughly impractical. 
 Could jolly well blow off in a strong breeze! 
 Fear not, Mr Havistock, don't be offended, that was just my little joke... 
 Gosh, I deserve a drink! A short interval, ladies and gentlemen. 
 We were sorry to miss your husband. 
 Oh, he'll have got himself distracted by some pretty young thing. 
 He's probably f*cking her right now. 
 If that's true, he's a very foolish man. 
 Something amuses you? 
 You throw me a few compliments, thinking... what? 
 That I'll betray my prince? 
 Divulge his darkest secrets? 
 Does he have any of those? 
 Oh, he's got a bunch. 
 Only one of which would be much use. 
 Then again, you only need one. 
 But you're never going to tell me. 
 Oh, but I might. 
 If you put your back into it. 
 You naughty boy. 
 Yes? Who is there, please? 
 Lord Hawthorne. 
 Leena Prasad. 
 Come, sit. 
 Leena, Leena. 
 Do you know, I was, er... I was just passing and I thought we could have a drink together. 
 Have you got any whisky? 
 No, but I have water. 
 ( He giggles ) 
 You really are an exquisite creature. 
 Sir, please. 
 Haven't we talked about this before? 
 Yes, yes, we have. 
 But I can't help myself. 
 Perhaps you should be leaving. 
 Every man in the room was looking at you. 
 Sir, please, that's enough. 
 No, it's not. 
 Sir, that's enough. Please leave! 
 No. 
 No, I don't want to leave. 
 Sir, stop. Please leave. 
 Sir, stop! 
 Whisky, please, no ice. 
 You seemed to be enjoying yourself up there. 
 Yes, I actually was. 
 Believe it or not. 
 Alice. 
 I'm giving you one last chance, do you understand? 
 I mean, I don't know if we can even trust that woman. 
 I don't know what she wants. 
 But I'm not about to risk everything in my life for a man who thinks it's somehow braver to suffer in silence. 
 You're better than that. 
 Or used to be. 
 Do you mind if I talk to my wife? 
 Right, we're leaving. Are we? 
 I believe we are. 
 ( Piercing scream from outside ) 
 ( Screaming ) 
 ( Screaming in pain ) 
 Put him out! Put him out! 
 Can you tell us what happened, Miss Prasad? 
 I heard a knock at the door. 
 I turned around and there he was. 
 Lord Hawthorne? 
 Yes. 
 And then what? 
 He came in. 
 You invited him in? 
 Yes. You did? 
 No. 
 I don't really remember. 
 Doesn't recall... 
 He took my hand... grabbed my hand... kissed it. 
 Are we absolutely sure about that? 
 He pulled me towards him. 
 He kissed me. 
 Well, that may be your recollection... 
 I just wanted him to stop. 
 If he'd listened to me. 
 If he'd left when I told him, then none of it might have happened. 
 I'm sorry, I was... 
 Please, there's no need. 
 Shall we? Yes. 
 So, while we were experiencing the nightmare that was yesterday evening, a riot broke out in Karachi. 
 A Muslim mob was about to let rip into the Hindu neighbourhoods in the city. I see. 
 It was all bloody vengeance over some insult to the Prophet Muhammad. 
 If our troops hadn't acted when they did, we would've had a massacre on our hands. 
 Any casualties? 
 47 killed last count. 
 So many? I'm advised the numbers would've been a lot worse if we'd sat on our hands. 
 But amongst the dead... 
 Naresh Banerjee. 
 Are you sure? 
 Shot dead. 
 His death certificate's on its way. 
 Thank God for that. 
 Just a shame we didn't get to speak to him first. 
 Sir? 
 ( Telephone rings ) 
 Ah! His Lordship's awake. 
 A gift? 
 Yes. It's from a friend. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Yes. 
 Those years we were apart... for a long time, I was so lost. 
 I met someone... a light in the darkness. 
 Kaira. 
 Do you love her? 
 Yes. 
 So why are you here then? 
 She died. 
 But, you know, you were always... 
 Please, you don't have to say anything you don't mean. 
 I always loved you. 
 I never stopped. 
 All the time we were apart, every day, your face was right before my eyes. 
 I know. 
 Every day, it was as if I could see you. 
 You can see me now. 
 I can't lose you again. 
 You won't. 
 Not this time. 
 Whelan. 
 How are you feeling, sir? 
 I don't want to be here. 
 I hate this place. 
 We'll get you home, as soon as you're strong enough. 
 Will you show me? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 You ready, Sir? 
 Yes. 
 ( He whimpers ) 
 Don't upset yourself. 
 How could anyone do this? 
 Well, Sir, she claims that she was trying to fend off your advances. 
 What? 
 She was trying to fight you off, that's what she claims. 
 Miss Prasad does? 
 Yes. What? 
 What, she's saying I attacked her? 
 I'm afraid so. 
 I attacked her, and she did this? 
 Why would she say that? 
 But...that's not what happened. 
 I don't understand. 
 I don't understand. 
 Why would she lie? 
 I imagine she wants people to believe that she had good reason. 
 For doing what she did, I mean. 
 She didn't do anything. 
 I'm... 
 I don't follow. 
 Well, we were talking... having a drink. 
 You know, just talking together. 
 You know? 
 When the door opened and in he came, half animal, half demon. 
 I've never seen anything like it. 
 In who came? 
 Uncle! 
 Adam? 
 Uncle! 
 Adam? 
 There was a boy. 
 A servant boy there. 
 Do you remember? 
 Uncle! 
 'He left me like this.' 
 So I want the little b*st*rd found. 
 I want the b*st*rd found, and I want him punished.
