 Again... I am in your hands. 
 Take this. Get it to his sister as quick as you can. 
 'For a while now I've been behaving in a manner that can't be described as Christian.' 
 'I know exactly what's been going on, exactly.' 
 And I also know that whatever has been is no longer. 
 My spies tell me there's a young lady on the scene. 
 What is it you wanted to ask? 
 'Who is that boy?' 
 'Adam. He's new.' 
 'We're going to want reserved quotas.' 
 So everyone has a voice. 
 The untouchables' leader he has no love of Gandhi. 
 Let's see if we can't break things up a bit. 
 'I saw Ramu Sood. He made me an offer.' 
 Stay on as manager of my uncle's estate. 
 This is not how we do things. 
 'The man you married is alive and you just simply took yourself off.' 
 If word somehow got out... 
 What do you want? 
 (Dance music) 
 (Camera clicks) 
 (Camera continues clicking) "The Master of the Viceregal Household is commanded by their Excellencies the Viceroy and Vicereine to invite you to a reception... at Viceregal Lodge to mark the occasion of the engagement of Mr Ralph Whelan... and Miss Madeleine Mathers. Prepare to eat cake." You have my measurements. Why we go through this every time... I'm still the same poor waif I was when I was 21. Better safe than sorry, memsahib. You're missing the floor show. (She sighs) (Children chatter) Who is invited? Oh, everyone and no-one. You know my brother - never off duty. "Prepare to eat cake." Yes. I don't know what it means, either. It's all a very closely guarded secret. Have you anything you can wear? There's a silver tea gown? A tea gown? Sounds impetuous. It was gifted to me by Lady Carmarthen. What? Our Lady Carmarthen? Whose divine gift of this building gave our school wings. The dress needed some adjustment. Well, I honestly can't imagine why(!) (Dance music) How's Madeleine getting on? Badminton. Flirting with half the 19th Lancers. Oh. Making up a four with assorted elderlies. Ralph... I saw you with that jumped-up fellow from the National Bank. Mackenzie? Oh. A small loan. Another one? Just to tide me over for the summer. This damn party. Ask her. You're getting married. It's perfectly proper for the wife's family to do their bit. Not your province. "Not your province." Listen to him. Old-fashioned to his crenellated backbone! (He laughs) I'm very happy for you, did I say? Incessantly. You are fond of the girl? Ralph! Oh, we're comfortable here. They bring us hot-water bottles made out of some kind of spaniel. I'm sorry you couldn't stay on at my brother's. Don't be. He gets his old life back. Besides, it was the proper thing to do. My sister's reputation needs all the help it can get. What? Boy. Boy! Over here! Joking. I was joking. Play. Please. "Prepare to eat cake." Very mysterious. Sarah. Don't tell me what it means. I love surprises. Now, have you got a minute? You see, I wanted to ask you a very special favour - as a friend. Oh, yes? It's about your brother's party. We're so happy to be asked but, you see... it's a little bit delicate. Those folk there, what are they doing? They are here for you, Mr Ian! Me? Why? Name of Mr Ian is known up and down the Kangra Valley! You are the very famous Englishman with the Indian sahib. Excuse me? My cousin Ramu Sood. He is the burrah sahib and you are his English chai-wallah. Scottish. Ah, English-Scottish... But you are still serving the tea, no? Hey! (He speaks own language) This blasted creature. I told her there is no work for her. We want no Tamil dogs here. We'll take her. What? I said, if she's fit to work. You start working today as soon as you're ready. Thank you, sir. I see now you are a kind man. 'Consider, gentlemen,' a democratic assembly in each and every province in India. But the question is, how best to represent all the peoples of India, not just, with the greatest respect, the Hindu majority. To which end, we are drawing up separate quotas - guaranteed seats for the Muslims' own political groups and the other smaller minorities. Untouchables number some 60 million - nearly one and a half times the population of your country. We are no small minority. No. But we in Congress maintain that your interests are best served by one voice. The voice of Mr Gandhi? Indeed. For 20 years now, Gandhiji is devoted to banishing the stain of untouchability. Let him be your champion. What do you say to that, Dr Kamble? 'I don't believe a word they're saying. Congress just want power.' Not justice. We are offering you a guaranteed seat at parliament for the first time in your history. They will never do that. Mr Whelan, tell me. How many years since your family first set foot in India? We arrived in... yes, 1824. '24. More than 100 years. So many words and promises and committees and commissions... I understand, I do, but this time... Do you know what it is to be born untouchable? Raised on carrion? Eyes, ears? Yes. Voice? No. Social justice? No. Rights of man? No. Hindu? Naturally. But God himself does not want me in his temple, sir. So I am obliged to ask, why after all these years, do you wish to help? Look... Congress just wants us gone, and once they achieve that, and that day is coming, do you honestly think those millions of poor out in the villages, who've never so much as laid eyes on an Englishman, will see their lives change one iota once these high-caste Brahmins start running their affairs? We're trying to give you a chance - a voice of your own. For God's sake, work with us, while there's still time. Fight these people. Do you think he should be carrying me up and down hills? Better I walk. Thank you, Mr Whelan. Dr Kamble! Please, don't go. Might I speak with you on a more personal matter? Dalal? Sir? Would you show this gentleman to the library? Certainly. This way, please. I'm inviting him to my party. I want him with me. I understand, sir. For God's sake, don't put him in a rickshaw. He doesn't like it. What are you doing with that filthy fellow? How should I know? Come. This way. Hm. I was thinking the pink or the blue? What do you think? Pink or blue? For what? Our engagement party, Ralph. Sister. Brother. I'll leave you to it. Mr Dalal. Miss Whelan. I trust you're well? Your family? All in perfect health. Thank you. Good. I wanted to thank you for your kindness in my latest hour of need. You misled me. I... No. I would never knowingly... Oh, I think you knew precisely what you were doing. You asked me to help you, and I was happy to help, when in reality what you were doing was tricking me into acting against my own brother. How could you possibly...? The note for your sister. You read it? Of course I read it. Thank God I did. The evidence, connecting that terrorist with Congress... You stole it, didn't you? (He stutters) Dalal! What will you do? I don't know. Ah. There you are. Don't keep a chap waiting. Excuse me. (Hubbub from the street) What if we're seen? Then we are two acquaintances that happened to meet. One day, when you are a fine District Officer, you and I will walk up and down like this every night. And nobody will dare to raise a finger. You won't miss Captain Codrington? That dirty graveyard! Are you joking? Sita, you promise me you gave that letter to my sister? Yes. I already told you. Why are you making this great tamasha about some silly letter? But I asked Sooni repeatedly. She denies ever receiving it. Typical Sooni. She's having fun with you. Clearly, she has hidden whatever this thing... Certificate. Clearly, she has hidden this certificate thing and, as usual, you are falling for her tricks. Aafrin... Hello? Are you even listening to me? Of course I am listening to you. I listen to every precious word! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... No, there's no need. I talk too much. Little Miss Chatterbox. My father always said it would be my undoing. No. You are fine. I had a horrible day, I can't tell you... You can tell me. My poor baby. I knew something was wrong. Come... Once more up and down? Please, do not make your mother punish you. Oh...! You think this small thing is pain? You want to know what is suffering? All this, I paid for you, because you are my son and I will never let you go. Amma! Adam...? The child was showing me the way to Summer Hill. Are you all right? Yes, thank you, Uncle. Adam? His good name? Yes. So he was christened. Very fine name. What did that woman want? She wants that I meet... someone. Who? I don't know. Adam, you must trust us to look after you. Do you understand? We're your guardians now. The young prince found a slipper while he was out hunting. Months he spent looking for the owner of this tiny slipper. Cinderella, is it? Sodewa Bai. It's the Indian version. Go and sit down. We were celebrating Ruth's name day. Well, happy birthday. Go and fetch me some of that cake, you. Show Baapi the card. Very thoughtful. This is your father, is it? Yes, Baapi. Daddy never forgets. Isn't that nice of him? Absolutely. Come on, put it away. You'll make the others quite jealous. Go... Go and play. Not you! He was doing no harm. Your mum's been worried sick. I'm sorry, I haven't been about much to help. Ruth has been my little helper. Anything to report? Nothing. Some tea? I wish I could. I'll look in again, when I can. I thought we agreed you wouldn't keep doing this. I like it here. I know. I'm sorry. It's just not for you. That's all there is to it. (Polite chatter) I'm going to buy you a drink cos you need one. I'm buying a round of drinks. Do you need a drink? Do you need a drink? Right. Steady on... Oh, for Christ's sake, I'm just saying, who here's thirsty? Cos I'm buying! Hey? Anyone? Bit early. Still, I'll have a drink, if it's going. No, you don't. Your money's not required, thank you, Mr McLeod. You saying I'm stupid? If only it were so simple. Kaiser! Why don't we all sit down? No. Kaiser! No, I'm not sitting down. I've come in here for a drink. So, where were you... Where were you when my uncle was flat broke and needed that loan? Sahib... No! No! No! And another thing... I'll help you. No-one's helping me! Take it outside! Come on... Get off me! Oh, dear... Get off! They'll be all right with him, won't they? Why don't I get you that drink? Don't you dare lie to your own mother! He was seen walking shamelessly down in the bazaar by Mrs Gool. And, as for this one, you will have no further contact. None at all! Unless you want your Hindu Chudail thrown on the street by her own people! Ma... Ma, sit... And don't think you'll be untouched yourself. Drink! ICS or no ICS, if even one word of this gets to Bombay... Shh-shh-shh, your poor father... Nobody is shouting but you, Ma. We'll just have to get you a poor widow, some schoolteacher. Shamshad, you'll have to resume your piano lessons. I'm not taking lessons from that fat witch! Well, you will, because you must! God knows where we're going to find the money. Sooni, you will have to cancel your classes. What? No! How can I think of studying law if I cannot read the documents? Well, just think of something else! My life is not your life! My life is my own! Do you have any idea the pressure I am now under? Huh? My life? Who cares about your life? Ah! The very man. So, you've been kitted out with your costume? Thank you, sir. Such a kind gift. Jolly good. Nothing to do with me. All my wife's idea. Now, look here... That, erm... unusual-looking fellow hanging around the gates yesterday... Dr Kamble? Yes. The untouchable. My ADC tells me you took it upon yourself to invite him to your engagement party. Well, naturally, I told him he was misinformed. Sir, I thought a show of hospitality would give him that extra push. Sorry, not with you... To persuade their people we can be trusted. So, you asked him along? Yes. To a party, here, at the Viceregal Lodge, kindly hosted as a particular favour to you by my wife. Have I blundered? Oh... The Maharajah of Kolhapur is here as my guest and we value his loyalty as we do that of all the other princely states. What's he going to say, do you imagine, breaking bread with an untouchable? To say nothing of all our other Hindu guests... The untouchables are Hindus themselves. Insufferable piety! My God, Whelan, you give the station chaplain a run for his money! Sir. The Hindus play by their own rules. And we jolly well keep our noses out of it. But if we can win over the untouchables, as discussed, we smash any future deal between them and Congress. Not on the night of your own engagement. Well... I am disappointed. I will not have any unpleasantness, hm? Not here. I'm asking you to trust me, sir. Where is he now? I'm loaning him my best man. Dalal! Your Excellency. Ah, yes... Your little munshi. Well, let's hope he can teach him how to hold a knife and fork. 
 
 (Street hubbub) We are Mahar people. My father was a very proud man. He decided one fine morning that he was sick and tired of walking. He wished to draw water locally, from the village tank. They said he was polluting the well. And they hanged him by his neck. Burned our home. After that, I was sent to a Muslim family in the city for an education. It was my father's last wish. And that is my story. I remember, sometimes we used to go for fish pathia at one of your Irani stalls. Where? On Chowpatti Beach? Of course. I, too. The juice would run down my chin. My ma used to scold me. (He imitates his mother) Your Mr Whelan... He has never shown me less than great personal kindness. I can trust him, as a Britisher? Yes. I think so. Good. Come... You wish to go in? How can I, when I am not welcome? You know, I have the highest esteem for Mr Ralph, sahib. He'll be relieved to hear it. But he cannot add on to insult by inviting all these untouchables together with the higher castes. It is... It is like pollution for us to eat together with these backward types. Miss Whelan! Poor old Brahmins are in a fix. If they attend the engagement along with these untouchables, mountains will shake, their high-bred souls will be cast into the pit. If they boycott, they miss out on the jolliest do of the summer. Tea? Tiffin? Oh, it's bara brith! Yes, why not? Now, Ronnie... Miss Whelan. Alice, for heaven's sake. Alice. I gather you're in charge of the table plan. Oh, a very modest cog... I had a favour to ask. You remember Mrs Sarah Raworth? Well, she wonders if, as a one-off, she might sit a bit further up. Up? Up what? The table. Golly. Yes, you see, it's a dream of hers to dine beside the Viceroy. Something for the grandchildren. Well, that's impossible. These things are determined by the order of precedence. To each according to their place. See? And, as a missionary's wife, Mrs Raworth appears alongside her husband. In between Sister Donoghue, and Mr Kumar, Sub-Divisional Officer for Drains and Sewage. Surely you can make an exception? Absolutely nothing to be done. Here. Borrow mine, if you like. Sugar? No, thank you. Do excuse me. Mm! Let's move, Princess! I'm growing old out here! I'm a queen! Not a princess. (Singing and chanting) Hear that? They're singing for rain. Hey, now, Bhupi? (He speaks in local language) Well, a bit of rain would be something. Not that one believes in such superstitious guff. Don't laugh at me. Come on... You have an engagement party to attend. Say you were on the other side of the world... I thought I already was. Total stranger says, "What's she like? Describe her to me." What would you say? Madeleine? I don't know. She was always very kind to me. You don't like her. Of course I like her. You like her, but you don't warm to her. I see you. Always scampering off. I'm leaving you to it. Oh... I see. You're jealous. Don't flatter yourself. Anyway, if you want the honest truth, I have a horrible feeling that she wants to save you. Save me? Now, that would be novel. It means she will do everything she can think of to make you happy. If you let her. Ralphie... It's enough. I don't know if I'm in love or just following orders. You'll always be here for me, won't you? Let them eat cake! I'm sorry? Eat cake. She's Marie Antoinette. He's King Louis of France. Wasn't I just saying it had to be something French? Yes, you certainly were. Bearer! More simkin! How he can afford it on 1,500 a year... Clearly, we should all marry Americans. I thought you could help. I'm sorry. I did try. Pity, I thought we were friends. We are friends. Put her in her place, down with the rubbish. I wonder where they'd sit you... Hm? If they knew... about your poor husband. What would they all say, do you imagine? Wait... Hello. Oh, I didn't recognise you in a suit. Yes. I would like to apologise, if I overdid things, the other night. We take such things in our stride. So, no hard feelings? Judge a man when he's sober or not at all, Mr Mcleod. Yes. Kindly inform Mr Sood that, under no circumstances, will you work under a native, least of all the man you hold responsible for your uncle's death. He's over there. Right. (Chatter and hubbub dies down) You're very welcome. Both of you. (Chatter resumes) What's going on? It's a local matter. Well, far above my head, I expect. Miss Whelan? I'm here for my brother, on his big day. As am I, Miss Whelan. As are we all. I would never do anything to hurt you. Excuse me. And they tried to send him all the way back to England, but... Sir. Excuse me. My employment as your estate manager... People are talking. They say you only took me on to butter up the British, to keep them from pressing charges, after you conspired to steal my uncle's land off him... after he died, sir, by your hand. Why did I offer you employment? Well, let me tell you. I am a businessman. It isn't you I want. It is your name. Your name, sir. Armitage. I mean to explore the export market and your name has value. Cheers. My name is McLeod. McLeod, Armitage... It's all British. But... if you work for me, I will raise you from your ignorance. I will teach you how to make this land pay. It is what you came for? Partly, I grant you, but... Anyway... it is your choice. Sorry, what were you saying? Your Royal Highness, if you please... Sarah? We thought we'd swap. You don't mind, do you? How could I mind? Oh? (Tapping on wine glass) Pray, be upstanding for the loyal toast. To the King Emperor! All : The King Emperor! Thank you. Thank you. Where is the...? (Speaks in indian) Pity the Maharajah. What grave insult, dining with the untouchable! Bearer! (Chatter dies) No need for fuss. Our guests would quite like to be fed. Thank you. Miss Whelan? Allow me to present our guest, Dr Kamble. Whelan? Yes. She is sister to the Private Secretary. Mr Dalal tells me he is a most trustworthy man. How kind of Mr Dalal. (Laughter) Which one's she? The one with the green sari. To be honest, I imagined a larger girl. Daddy...! Come, let's follow them. Come! Come on! Come on! Come on...! She will turn and see! I first met this fellow in Madras. I was Governor. And Whelan was a very green assistant magistrate, riding off in his father's boots. And I went with him on one of his blasted assizes. And we sat down under a banyan tree, weighing up some legal dispute or other. I forget what. Oh, yes! It was the Forestry Commission versus some dark, little Indian tenant farmer. What was it we called him? Bob Cratchit... Bob Cratchit! On account of the tiny child on his lap. And do you know? Cratchit won the day. His half-acre was returned to him. Riding home, every village headman turned out to greet us. Maa baap, they called him. Maa baap. Mother-father. 21 years old. (Applause) Earth, swallow me up! Sita...? They will have started the dancing. (Applause) (Gentle waltz music) All these people... What about them? Do you even know them? Did we do this? No. They did it themselves. We just gave them a little push, that's all. You see people at these things you never see anywhere else. Things? Our thing. Will your, er... your father be coming to the wedding? Oh, I doubt it. Too occupied with his work, I expect. Yes. And no. You see, right now, I'm afraid he'd have trouble raising the funds. I doubt that. I was under the impression he was thriving. Oh, absolutely. He was. I'm afraid I never had any head for business, but... Well, the crash... Yes, go on. The market went up in smoke. As far I understand it, we were relying on government contracts. And when those dried up... the only way Dad could stay solvent was by buying back his own company. As I say, I've no head for business. Not at all. Can I refresh your glass? You sound like a waiter! Clever Mr Mathers! Does she know? No. I promise. Amma! Amma! Amma...! You came. I was dreaming of your father. I'll take you to him. (Gentle jazz music) Which one is your husband? Oh, I expect he's gone home. Yes! So glad to hear that. Look... We want to help, but Congress are spoiling for a fight over these elections. You hold your ground, insist on your right to the quota and we will stand with you. What do you say? This isn't more divide and rule? Drive the Indians apart, so much the better for the British? Not this time. Do you swear it? Do you swear the Viceroy will publicly support us, even if Mr Gandhi moves against us? I swear it. We are your allies. Haven't we proven as much tonight? I will stand with you. You go to her. What? Leena! I'm so glad you came! See how tired he looks? Come on, let's find you a drink. I've made him so unhappy. I didn't mean to. Any unhappiness was there long before he met you. No. I gave it to him. This was a stupid mistake. I never should have come. If that man is unhappy now, tonight, it's because he knows what he wants and some god's put it in his head he can't have it. Alice... He's in love. And so are you. And that's all there is. At least let's meet the child. No! Why give them hope when there is no hope? 1,000 years, our community stands alone through marriage. Aafrin doesn't have 1,000 years. He's got one little life. Everything is falling apart. Nothing's falling apart. Don't go. Miss Whelan. Forgive me. It was never my intention to force a lie between yourself and your brother, for whom I have the highest... Stop... making stupid speeches you don't even mean. Why do you say that? You don't know me. Why do you imagine you know what's in my head? The evidence, or whatever it was, showing that man was political... you stole it. Why? Because Ralphie asked us to lie, about the shooting, about what we heard? Yes. No. I... I'm sick and tired of being other people's puppet. You do know I have to tell him? No. I will tell him myself. (Rolling thunder) Damn. What? Isn't it wonderful? No. Wait... Are you happy? Can't you tell? I've never been happier in all my life. What is it? Come on, we'll catch our death. I'll see you inside. Oh...! Captain Farquhar, sir. Royal Irish First Battalion. So, what's your story? I thought you'd be pleased to see me. Alice. I have heard of British men who take Indian mistresses. Forgive me. Never the other way round. Get out! You're not welcome! Understand, Mr McLeod? For God's sake, Sooni! One day, I will wake up and say, what about me? When is it my turn to choose?
