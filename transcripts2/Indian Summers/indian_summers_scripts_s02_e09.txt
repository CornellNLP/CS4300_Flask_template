 Jaya! 
 What do you know of that woman? 
 For who do you work, Bhupinder? 
 In this one, the Viceroy recommends the sentence be commuted from death by hanging to life imprisonment. 
 And this one? 
 Let him hang. 
 Yes, I will marry you. 
 The princes have condemned the India Bill, they'll play no part in any federation. 
 Madeleine. 
 And what about the job? 
 The new Viceroy? Is that it? Is it over? 
 Not at all. 
 Come with me if you like. 
 What will we do for money? 
 I know an agent in Bombay. 
 I'm going away with Alice Havistock. 
 We're going overseas. Australia. 
 We're going to go on a big adventure. 
 Where is my wife? 
 Agh! 
 Not late am I? 
 Come on, Percy. Off we go. Come on. 
 Alice? 
 Oh... 
 Ohh! 
 It's cocktail time! 
 Who's got a head for heights? 
 Oh, here he is! My champion jockey! 
 Come on! Tell us what you think. 
 Come on, Whelan. First of the night! Down it goes! 
 Well? 
 Jesus. 
 It was all Kaiser's idea. 
 Oh, no, no, it's Memsahib's inspiration. 
 Yes, but what's it called? 
 Running Scared by the look of him! 
 No! What about First Past The Post? 
 Or... Winner Takes All? 
 Fortune Favours The Bold? 
 Oh, yes, that's a good one. 
 What's going on? 
 Well, there was a meeting in Whitehall this morning. 
 It's their morning, so it's all right, chances are they're still in session. 
 And? 
 Well, and it's to decide on a particular appointment. 
 The new Viceroy. 
 Yeah. 
 Christ! I haven't heard a peep out of anyone. 
 Don't panic. 
 Willingdon is going to be the first to hear, isn't he? 
 Which means you'll be second. 
 No, I imagine the first to hear would be the appointee himself. 
 Stop that. Cut it out. 
 We've no reason not to feel very bright. 
 No more talking to Mr McLeod or any of his people, do you hear? 
 I'm sorry. 
 They act like they're your friends, but in fact... 
 What's going on? 
 Are you all right, Percy? 
 Nosebleed! Gets them all the time, don't you, old fellow? 
 Well, he's never had one before. 
 What are you doing? 
 Me? 
 Unpacking. 
 See? All her pretty things. 
 Where is she? 
 Ralph! 
 Ralph! 
 Alice! 
 Ralph! 
 Not all this again. 
 Ralph! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Al? 
 Ralph! 
 Sahib! Don't be afraid -- we'll have you out of there in no time. 
 Where's the damn key? I had a fellow change the locks. 
 Open this door. 
 No. My wife needs time to rest and recover. 
 What have you done to her? 
 Easy-squeasy. Breast pocket, left-hand side. 
 Go on, take a look. 
 Three tickets for the Cathay, tourist class. 
 Two adults, one sprat, bound for Sydney, Australia. 
 The boat sails from Bombay first thing on Tuesday. 
 Where are the names? 
 There in black and white. 
 My wife... my little boy... and your little Parsi. 
 My what? 
 Dalal. 
 He's a pretty fellow. Beggars belief we were all so blind to it. 
 One has to ask why. 
 Agh! 
 Hold your horses. 
 Ralphie... 
 You're all making fun of me. 
 Where's the Parsi now? 
 There's a room, behind some sort of Tibetan shop. 
 Antiquities and so on. 
 Cynthia. 
 Now, listen -- who will give me 100 rupees for Mr Ronnie Keane? 
 He's a little bit scuffed, some foxing on the outer cover, but he's alive and kicking! 
 Ladies? 
 Come on! Don't hold back! 
 Oh, look! There's someone! 
 Well, beggars can't be choosers! 
 But is she good for it? 
 No. 
 Open this door! 
 Let me out! 
 Mrs Sparrow, you made good time. 
 Ralph... I can explain. 
 Oh, yes? 
 This man, this man is not fit to be left alone with anyone, least of all a woman and child. 
 You don't have the foggiest notion what this man is. 
 Now, let me tell you... about the creature to whom you farmed out my sister. 
 That's enough. 
 Dalal is a liar! 
 No. No, he's worse than that. 
 He's a terrorist. 
 He's a traitor. 
 What are you talking about? 
 "Be bold in mischief! Dare some mighty crime!" 
 You think that bomb strike on the Viceroy was the work of one man on his own? Christ, not a chance! 
 I've never heard so much rubbish in all my life. 
 Believe me! 
 He and his brother-in-mischief, Naresh Banerjee, were set to blow us all to hell! 
 It's true! I swear to God! 
 She knows! Don't you?! 
 It's all right. 
 Bhupinder. Run and fetch the policeman. 
 Atta boy. 
 Down the hatch, down the hatch, that's it. 
 That's it, there we go. 
 Nearly there. 
 It's all right. 
 I can run things from here. 
 Sooni! 
 Wait, me first! 
 No, listen to me. I have heard the most terrible reports about your brother. 
 Yes, he went away last night. 
 No, he's here, in Simla. He's been detained by the police. 
 What? 
 On what charge? 
 We wish to speak to Dalal. 
 He is not here at present. 
 What a silly error on my part. 
 Aafrin! 
 Sergeant, I do beg your pardon. 
 Aafrin! 
 Aafrin! 
 Brother. Let us go. 
 Come on. 
 Get up. 
 Sooni, go home. 
 Say nothing. 
 Not a word to anyone. Do you understand? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Mr Khan, please take her now. 
 Come. 
 There is nothing to be done here. 
 I'm sure there's a perfectly sound explanation, sir. 
 I hope so. 
 I don't understand. 
 If he's been arrested, then what he is doing up there? 
 I believe they are being discreet, on account of his position in the service. 
 But what is he believed to have actually done? 
 Don't lose heart. 
 As yet, there is no charge against him. 
 Tell me. 
 I hear there were certain... political activities. 
 Can I see Mummy now? 
 See? 
 What did I tell you? It's nothing to be scared of. 
 Hello. I missed you! 
 I missed you too. 
 That's right, you hold her tight. 
 Now I want you to remember this. 
 Form a sort of... picture of it in your head, if you like. 
 Cos Muddle's going away on a little trip, aren't you, Muddle? 
 What trip? 
 Can't we go, Daddy? 
 Say bye-bye now. Come on, say bye-bye now. 
 Say bye-bye. Say bye-bye. Off we go. 
 Percy! 
 Bye-bye, Mummy. 
 Where's Aafrin? 
 Oh, it's out of our hands now. 
 Aafrin. 
 Used to do just the same when Percy had trouble sleeping! 
 Is, er, someone going to answer that? 
 Bhupi! 
 Mr Dalal is our friend. 
 The man is a traitor. 
 We do what we can to salvage some... scrap of honour from this mess. 
 Oh, wake up, Ralph. 
 You let that piece of sh1t take over your house. 
 You sit there hiding in that shirt. 
 Please! Please! 
 Do you hear that? 
 You know what that is? 
 That is the sound of your sister losing hope. 
 Help! Please! 
 What is it, Bhupi? 
 Sahib, His Excellency is asking you to come to Viceregal Lodge most urgently. 
 Ugh, what now? 
 I believe Whitehall have finally decided who will be the next Viceroy of India. 
 Oh, my God. Who is it? 
 I don't know. 
 Is it you? 
 I-I don't know! 
 Ralph! 
 You stay here with Alice. 
 I have to go. 
 Bhupi, where's the damn rickshaw? 
 No, wait, tell the syce. 
 Better I ride over. More of a statement, yes? 
 Yes! Now, go! 
 Five minutes and everything will be done. 
 Two minutes. I'll be up top. 
 Good luck, Sahib. 
 One moment. 
 Not one word. 
 Sooni? 
 Sooni, have you seen your brother anywhere? 
 Yes, I was just with him. 
 Oh, thank God, thank God. 
 Didn't I tell you there must just be some silly mix-up? 
 But... where? 
 At work. 
 There, you see? 
 Typical! Nose to the grindstone! 
 But what about the letter, Daddy? 
 Oh, that old thing... 
 Do you know what I think happened? 
 I bet this is what he wrote last year before he went off on tour. 
 And I happened to discover it only this morning -- and we all leap -- don't we -- to... 
 Yes! Yes, that's it, Daddy. 
 Of course that must be it. 
 You've been summoned. Come on. 
 Hello, sir! 
 Hello, hello. 
 I don't believe we've had the pleasure. 
 My name is Havistock. 
 Ah, Havistock. 
 McLeod. 
 Ah, just the man. 
 There was a revolutionary by the name of Naresh Banerjee, I understand you took him in for a night or two? 
 Aye, it's common knowledge. 
 He stole my horse. 
 Oh, what a rascal! 
 Now, this fellow. 
 You know him? 
 Only by sight. 
 I wonder -- did you ever... see him out here with Banerjee? 
 No. 
 No? 
 Well... inquisition over. 
 Good day, sir. 
 Hello, hello. 
 Now, I have a matching pair of these for anyone who saw this fine fellow. 
 Now if you would be so kind as to pass it around. 
 Send these people home. 
 I can't do that, what do I tell them? 
 Tell them you're closed for repairs. 
 Thank you, Rowntree. 
 This shouldn't take long. 
 You two, how long? 
 What difference does it make? 
 Let me tell you exactly how long. 
 One night, I was very cold. I had a bullet, you see, in here -- and all I wanted to do was fall asleep. 
 But there was this woman. 
 And she took my hand. 
 Three years. 
 Three years you've been living this lie! 
 It wasn't a lie. 
 You were deceiving everyone around you -- we call that a lie. 
 Love, please stop jiggling about. 
 You're making us all feel rather seasick. 
 You pushed them down this road, you gave them a room. 
 You're nothing but an old pimp! 
 I did it for your sake, Ralph -- for your reputation. 
 It was obvious they couldn't keep their hands off each other, I just gave them somewhere private to... do their business. 
 And sending them off to Australia, was that your idea as well? 
 It was mine. 
 I had to get Alice out of India, away from that man. 
 You know nothing about this man. 
 How can you even begin to say that? 
 Oh, all right? Let's see shall we? 
 Kaira Das? You know about her I suppose? 
 Yes. 
 Aafrin? You and this agitator were lovers, correct? 
 Yes. 
 I know, he told me. 
 For two years in Bengal, this man -- your constant star -- he had her with him every night, yes? 
 I know. 
 And then you stood by stood by -- while another man put a revolver to her head and shot her... 
 It wasn't like that! 
 I believe you. 
 You sit down. Sit down! 
 We're just getting started. 
 Then Aafrin and this murderer now plot to blow up half of Simla! 
 Ralphie... 
 I told you. I warned you. 
 Oh, yes. At the eleventh hour. 
 I did everything I could to stop it! 
 Oh, well try telling that to Douglas Raworth's widow -- his two sons -- how are they going to feel, growing up without a father? 
 Whenever they're suffering, or in trouble, or even if they just do well at something, they're going to feel him, feel the lack of him, the lack of a father. 
 You think I don't know that? 
 This man, he lies and he lies and... 
 Stop it! 
 I understand. You loved him. You trusted him. 
 So did I. 
 Don't... Don't! Don't cry. 
 I'm not crying for me. 
 For you. 
 Don't say that. 
 You know what my husband is like. 
 You've seen him. 
 Tell me, what exactly did you do to stop him? 
 At least Aafrin did something. 
 Whereas you -- you know, sometimes I almost think it suits you to have me stuck here, trapped in Chotipool. Your little flower. 
 While you come and go like some sort of kindly jailer. 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 Maybe I have the right to say no, this is not good enough. 
 I choose something better. 
 Love, you know, sometimes you have to adjust. 
 I mean, look at me, I've got his lot in my club, day in day out. 
 Do I like it? No. 
 Do I jolly well get on with it? Yes. 
 Because you've got to. Haven't you? 
 What, Bhupinder? 
 Sir, they are looking for you high and low. 
 His Excellency is waiting. 
 Right. 
 Yes? What else? 
 Memsahib, Mr Charlie wants... 
 Miss Alice to come home now. 
 Ralph, don't you see? 
 He woke me up. 
 And I thought, this is him. 
 This is the one. 
 Don't tell me you never had that feeling. 
 Not for a long time. 
 I... 
 We... are begging for your help. 
 Please don't let them hurt him. 
 It's out of my hands, I'm sorry. 
 Then what's the point of you? 
 Wait, Alice. 
 Goodbye, brother. 
 Al! 
 Wait. Wait! 
 You win. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Ah, Rowntree. 
 Dalal, sir? 
 He's up at the clubhouse. 
 In you go, Singh. 
 Do you know, I think I may have led you up the garden path with regards to an innocent man? 
 Too late for that, sir. 
 What do you mean? 
 We've had some new information. 
 What new information? 
 I'm afraid I'm not free to say at this point, sir. 
 Wait! 
 Stop it. Mr Dalal! 
 What are you doing? 
 That's right, sergeant. 
 Get that babu out of here. 
 You're to call him sir. He's one of us. 
 I'm starting to wonder if he ever was. 
 Now, look here -- no charges are to be made against that man without my say-so! 
 Is that understood? 
 What was that? 
 Are we about to invade? 
 I imagine it's for the new viceroy. 
 Aha, Whelan! 
 We've all been hunting high and low! 
 Have they made an announcement? 
 Our new leader? Yes, they most certainly have. 
 So who is it? Who are we going with? 
 You actually don't...? 
 I beg your pardon, one naturally assumed you'd be the very first person to... 
 Tell me. 
 Younger chap. 
 Yes? 
 The Marquis of Linlithgow. 
 At least I think he's younger! 
 Godson to Victoria. Damn fine choice, by all accounts. 
 Very. 
 Had any dealings with him yourself? 
 Never. 
 No? 
 Still, it's what we all need. A new face. 
 Shake things up a bit. 
 And he's done fine work in the field of nutrition. Ah, Cummings! 
 These two men, you saw them together? 
 Is she quite certain? 
 A man's life is in the balance here. 
 Tell her. 
 Haa. 
 This two mens. Yes. 
 Why didn't you come forward with all this months ago? 
 Ugh! Tell her! 
 Scared witless, I imagine, poor thing. 
 Now, will it stand? 
 The statement? 
 If she stands by it, yes. 
 Good. 
 Then we have enough to press charges? 
 Well, there are questions to be answered. 
 Lakshmi! 
 Oh, hello again. 
 What are you doing with her? 
 Well, I'm trying to interest her in a cream puff. 
 Come on, Lakshmi. Let's get you home, eh? 
 Yes, she has been very kind. Tell her, yes. 
 And the District Superintendent knows where to find you, should the need arise. 
 Come on. 
 Lakshmi, what did you say to that man? 
 Nothing, Mr Ian. 
 Nothing. Are you sure? 
 Haa. 
 Oh, he's back for more. 
 Having trouble finding your way out? 
 Mr Rowntree, Lakshmi's a good worker, I grant you, but she's not been well... 
 I think we're all aware that she is a local woman. 
 An ordinary woman. 
 But they do say justice is blind, sir. 
 Of course. 
 Her opinion has equal weight to anyone else, be they white, brown or mustard. 
 Just leave this with us, McLeod. 
 Sir, I am the one who stopped your terrorist. 
 I'm the one who gave him up to you. 
 Whatever you may think of me, I expect to be heard when I say that woman's judgment is not safe. 
 Well. 
 Off you pop. 
 Hey, wee man. Can you show me the way out? 
 This way, Sahib. 
 Your name -- Adam, is it not? 
 Yes, Adam. 
 Your mother worked for me. Did you know that? 
 No. Jaya-mummy or Leena-mummy? 
 Jaya-mummy. 
 And Leena-mummy? Where is she? 
 In prison. Jailed for nine years. 
 You didn't know? 
 Nobody told me. 
 And your father? 
 Where is he now? 
 Dead. 
 Douglas Raworth? 
 Yes. 
 No, I meant your real father. 
 I never knew him. 
 Thank you. 
 I know the way from here. 
 What is the charge? 
 What am I being charged with here? 
 Sergeant! 
 Ek minute. 
 Charges are still pending. 
 With a case like this, they have to be certain. 
 Help me. 
 Please. 
 Very well. 
 I can help you. 
 As I helped Mr Banerjee. 
 What's this? 
 Your death. 
 You've seen one of these before? 
 Yes, I have. 
 They say there is little pain. 
 Naseem. 
 What news? 
 Still no charge. 
 Oh. 
 So when can he come home? 
 Soon. 
 Good. 
 Sooni, meri jaan... 
 My uncle has come up. 
 Delhi uncle or Rawalpindi? 
 Rawalpindi. 
 He is keen to meet, and... 
 Oh, not today, Naseem. 
 Of course. 
 Forgive my mentioning it. 
 You can meet him just as easily the next time, or at the wedding itself. 
 Yes. That will be nice. 
 Oh, I must... 
 Go. 
 And if there's anything I can do, think it, and I'll come running. 
 I know. 
 Thank you. 
 Was that Aafrin? 
 No, it was just some box-wallah, selling... 
 I don't know what. 
 Tell them we don't have money to spare for rubbish. 
 What is that, Daddy? 
 Erm... 
 A letter. 
 From the dasturji. 
 He feels there is a really auspicious date very soon for your wedding with Boman. 
 Oh, what was the date he mentioned, Daddy? 
 I forget, I... 
 Here it is. Behram Roj? 
 But do you think we'd be ready so soon? 
 Well, I mean, it will require some careful consideration... 
 One day is as good as any other. 
 Look, I know you're upset. 
 No, I... I gather His Lordship has done some fine work in nutrition. 
 Don't be an idiot. 
 The truth is, you had it on merit. 
 But first we took a dreadful hiding with this India Bill. 
 Yes. 
 And then there was the matter of my family. 
 Yes. 
 Sir? Was there something else? 
 Well, it was said -- and I don't know how it came about, or who it came from -- that you were in over your head with certain debts at the bank. 
 I told them, it's not for a gentleman to go raking over another chap's private affairs, but I can't pretend it didn't damage your case. 
 Yes. 
 I have an idea how that rumour might have come about. 
 The truth is... 
 No, no, no. It doesn't matter. 
 I know what you're made of. 
 My boy. 
 Thank you. 
 Ralph. 
 Excuse me. 
 Get off me! 
 Is it true? 
 Yes. 
 After all that sacrifice, we get nothing? 
 Oh, it's worse than that. 
 How do you mean? 
 You see, the new Viceroy's going to have his own ideas about who he wants around him. 
 It's an honour to meet you, your Excellency. 
 I have a gift for you. 
 It's a wee box of my very own Armitage tea, so that when you're at home in your armchair and you're thinking of us, you can taste these hills again. 
 That's very decent of you, Mr...? 
 McLeod. Now tell me, Your Excellency, you ever heard of a man called Ramu Sood? 
 No, I don't believe I have. 
 Oh, Christ. 
 I'm sorry to hear that, sir. 
 You should always make a note of the men you hang. 
 Your Excellency, you're running late. 
 Not only was he innocent of the murder of Jaya Mohan, but your man here knew it. 
 He knew it and still he let him die! 
 Remove him. 
 Didn't you? 
 Didn't you? 
 Didn't you?! 
 Enjoy your tea. 
 This way. 
 What a business. 
 Now there's the dinner in your honour, if you can stand it. 
 Should go and change, sir. 
 Welcome to India, Thompson. 
 Safe journey up? 
 Very safe, very safe. 
 Who is, erm...? 
 Sir Cecil Thompson. 
 Hmm, of course. 
 Just flew in. I gather he's advising the new Viceroy. 
 Sir, it's time for the band. 
 Ah, the band. 
 Ladies and gentlemen... 
 Very bracing. 
 .. please make your way forward to the garden. 
 That fellow at the gates... what was he barking about? 
 Oh, some local crime. 
 Yes, I thought as much. 
 Was there something you wish to ask, sir? 
 No. 
 Don't you want to know if there's any truth in it? 
 The fact is... it's all true. 
 Every word. 
 What rot. 
 Her name was Jaya Mohan, and she bore my child... 
 Look, stop this. 
 There's more. 
 I've lied. And I've lied. 
 And I've lied again. 
 About who I was... 
 There you are. 
 That's why your son's not home. 
 He's out there doing his duty along with the others. 
 Listening to the band? Hardly a duty! 
 But, if he's up there...? 
 Yes? 
 Why didn't he come home to get into his suit? 
 Ah. 
 He will have borrowed a suit. 
 There you are. 
 No, that can't be. That can't be -- he always comes home. 
 All right, I propose I simply go up and see him, yes? 
 No! 
 Erm... I'll walk with you. 
 Oh, just a minute. 
 Just let me catch my breath. 
 It's all right. 
 Baapi? 
 What? 
 I'm afraid... 
 We're not going to find Aafrin up here. 
 Why? 
 He's in some sort of trouble. 
 This trouble, is it in any way to do with the English woman? 
 Yes? 
 It's possible. 
 I should have been more strict. 
 Baapi, it's not your fault. 
 You people! 
 You make a shrine of your own passions. 
 You don't care a jot for what's right. 
 And now do you see? 
 How all are made to suffer because of a few selfish actions? 
 How is it to end? 
 Never better. 
 Alice. 
 Where's Percy? 
 Out with Ayah, enjoying the sights. 
 Come here. 
 What do you want? 
 It's an odd feeling, knowing the worst. 
 I feel almost light-headed. 
 Have you ever had that? 
 I don't know. 
 It's the sheer relief. 
 Yes, I suppose that's what it is, knowing what you're up against, and what needs to be done. 
 That sounds clear. 
 Yes. 
 The policeman is expecting my statement in 30 minutes. 
 And? 
 What will you tell him? 
 The truth. 
 Dalal's alliance with the traitor Banerjee -- we have one eyewitness to that effect, I will add what I can. 
 You know nothing. 
 Well... 
 I know that Dalal, evidently fearing arrest, was planning to escape to Australia with my wife and son. 
 Hand. 
 Now, the next few months will be sticky. 
 Dr Kingsley is on his way over. 
 He will make a judgment as to your state of mind. 
 Tongue lolling and eyes in the back of your skull is your best bet at this point. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Unsound mind. 
 That's your best defence. 
 You'll go on a trip to some place with... short fingernails and... fresh air and armies of nuns... but you'll survive. 
 And Aafrin? 
 Oh, he'll hang. 
 Percy? 
 Oh... 
 Home, with me, of course. 
 Yes, but... people will know. 
 They'll find out, they'll talk about it. 
 You won't like that. 
 Oh... don't kid yourself. 
 I will relish our disgrace. 
 Are you sure? 
 Everywhere you go, "Look," they'll say, "there's that pitiful man from the bank." 
 Pity is all right. 
 Hell for women, of course, but men seem to do all right on it. 
 Tell me... what can I do? 
 What do you want? 
 I want my wife. 
 You see? 
 I can give you that. 
 I can give you what you want. 
 And what is that? 
 Affection. 
 Obedience. 
 I want a wife, not a puppy. 
 Oh, one's much like another. 
 You can do what you like, they don't mind, they still come bouncing back. 
 But if I broke it... if I broke this creature, would it mind? 
 No. 
 Can't have it running off again, you see. 
 No, it wouldn't mind. 
 You could do anything. 
 Anything at all. 
 And it would love you, just as much as it could. 
 Are you sure? 
 I promise... just let me have my son... and you, of course. 
 Yes. 
 We could leave in the morning, couldn't we? 
 If you like. 
 Get the earliest boat home and travel in style -- first class, why not? Percy would like that, wouldn't he? 
 Oh, he'd love it. 
 Yes, he would, rather. 
 And... as a favour, you'd drop all that nonsense about Mr Dalal, wouldn't you? 
 Wait... 
 No... 
 Wait, wait... 
 You can trust me. 
 Wait, wait, no, no... 
 I can prove it. 
 Wait, no, no... 
 No, no, no, no -- you know I don't... you know I don't like all that. 
 No, I'll need better proof than that. 
 Anything. 
 Well? 
 Sir, I gather we owe you an apology. 
 Alice? 
 You're out. 
 Yes! 
 No charge, after all. 
 I am a free man. 
 I tell you, these past few hours... 
 Your family will be so relieved. 
 It's not too late. 
 Too late for what? 
 Come away with me. 
 It's been such a long day... but it's given me time to think. 
 I've decided, for everyone's sake... we need to stop this. 
 What? 
 Stop this. 
 Dead in its tracks, before anyone gets hurt. 
 What rubbish. 
 You love me. 
 Not in the way you mean. 
 Who put you up to this? 
 No-one. I promise. 
 You just have to face the facts. 
 I mean, say we go along with this plan of yours... who's to say, one day very soon, I... I won't look at you, and I won't say to myself... "I gave up everything and everyone I hold dear for some silly flirtation. Am I happy? No. Is it enough? No. Do I love him? No. No." 
 What has he done to you? 
 Goodbye. 
 Give Mummy a wave.
