 Now, just swing and miss, do you hear? 
 He'd have been much better off letting me win. 
 You always do. 
 This is Boman. 
 Oh, what a very fine boy you are, too! 
 Aghh! 
 Sooni! 
 It was all thanks to Mr Ian in the end. 
 Mr Khan, when will you rise to the occasion? 
 Who told you there was a bomb? I need a name. 
 Aafrin Dalal. 
 What is my mother doing with that man? 
 Oh, love, he's your daddy. 
 Agh! 
 SHUT UP! SHUT UP! 
 Ralphie... 
 Oh... 
 Ralphie! 
 Oh, love. 
 I knew it would only be a matter of time. 
 Come on, apple brandy, no excuses. 
 Here we go. Now, then. 
 There. That's it, good as new. 
 Now, listen, I've been in touch with my old friend. 
 No need for names. He's the bridge partner of one of the new crowd at the India Office now Sir Samuel's on his way out. Anyway, according to him, old Hawthorne has been as good as his word. 
 Yeah! He's singing your praises, he is! 
 So you see, you're still very much in the, well... 
 I think I might have seen them. 
 Oh... Oh. 
 S-Seen who, dear? 
 My mother and... your husband. 
 I don't know if I remember it, or I dreamed it, or I'm making it up... 
 When was this? 
 I don't know. It was in the house. 
 It was in my house. 
 Well, yeah... 
 I'd have to say that, yeah, it's possible. 
 So how long did all this last? 
 I thought it was just a summer or two. 
 No. 
 No, it... it was a bit longer than that. 
 Oh, Ralphie, don't blame me. 
 It really isn't fair. 
 You could have stopped them! 
 How? 
 You stood by and you let it happen! 
 Mr Ian! 
 Sooni! 
 MISS Sooni! 
 Miss Dalal! 
 Yes? Which of us do you want to see? 
 Ha-ha! Very good! I am going to make us a lovely omelette. 
 Yes, I don't have all day, Mr Ian. 
 Now, how many people are there currently working here on the estate? 
 Stitches come out? 
 Er... all gone, yes. 
 And how are you feeling? Better? 
 Very much. 
 Now, first of all I will need a list of names, with... 
 Sooni. 
 Sooni, I must confess, I didnae just ask you here to discuss employment contracts. 
 Oh. 
 I had something I wanted to say to you. 
 Um... 
 You know... actually... I think I should be going. 
 No, it won't be long. 
 I know it's not much, not yet, but we're building something here. 
 A world of our own, you might say. 
 But lately, since our paths crossed... 
 I thought, you know, I cannae carry it all on my own. 
 Sooni... 
 Please. 
 You're the most courageous woman I ever met. 
 I... 
 I admire you... 
 I fear you... 
 I fear disappointing you. 
 Would you ever consider joining me? 
 Sharing the work I do? 
 What are you saying? 
 Er... I want a... a friend... a wife. 
 Me? 
 Here? 
 Aye, if you like. 
 Mr Ian... 
 Yes. 
 I have to go. 
 Right you are. 
 But... 
 Will you...? 
 Think about it. Yes. 
 Aye. You do that. You think about it. 
 The Viceroy was sorry not to join us. 
 Oh, His Excellency is yesterday's news. 
 But you're the coming man, are you not? 
 I think that depends on Your Highness. 
 Really? 
 I am still hoping you can help me turn the other princes. 
 We're not back on this government bill of yours? 
 I'm afraid we are. 
 And why should I agree to any of it? 
 Like it or not, Your Highness, India wants her freedom. 
 But you see my trouble, don't you, Whelan? 
 I'm free already! 
 Miss Dalal! 
 Oh, you're busy. 
 No. 
 Yes, well, we are going to press in... Oh, God. 
 I should go. 
 No, wait, wait, wait. 
 I have all the time in the world! 
 I'm sorry, I am a little confused, because... well, two hours ago, Mr Ian, he made a... Well, he... 
 He... What did he do to you? 
 He made a proposal of marriage. 
 I see. 
 Yes. 
 And may I ask what answer did you give? 
 I told him I would think about it. 
 Yes, caution is no bad thing. 
 But now I find I have been promised away to some other boy. 
 My God. What boy? 
 He is from my own people, he has the most enormous eyebrows. 
 How unnecessary. 
 And I only come to you because, well, my brother is away and... I suppose you are the next best thing. 
 The next best thing! I say, what an honoured position you put me in(!) 
 Forgive me, I thought you were my friend. 
 For God's sake, tell me, what can I do? 
 If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't have bothered coming! 
 We must think. We must wait and we must think. 
 There is no time, you stupid man. 
 Why not? 
 Because he is here already. 
 Who is? 
 The eyebrow man! 
 Here we are. 
 Tell me, have you ever heard the one about the Prince of Aghar? 
 Ferocious hunter, you can well imagine. 
 One afternoon, bored of his usual practise, he calls out to his shikari, "Untie the goat." 
 And untie it they do. 
 And in its place... 
 Yes, I remember the story. 
 And in its place, they tie a baby to a pole. 
 A baby! 
 Not yet weaned. 
 To bait a tiger. 
 Just for the hell of it. 
 Imagine! 
 And the Prince looks at the father of the child. 
 "Fear not," says the Prince. 
 "I am a damn fine shot!" 
 And that, my friend, is freedom. 
 From interference, you understand? 
 I say, shall we try it out? 
 What? 
 Untie the goat! 
 Its services are no longer required. 
 Tie the fellow up. 
 Boy! 
 Your Highness, we should head up. 
 This is all very amusing, but... 
 It's nothing of the sort. 
 You look me in the eye, give me your word as a gentleman, nothing will touch my freedom. 
 Yes. But there are... 
 You see? That's exactly my point. 
 It has to be one thing or the other. 
 Either I am free to do as I please, or majesty is subject to the will of others. 
 Outside forces. 
 Sahib? 
 Don't do this. Just to prove a point. 
 But I want to. 
 All right. 
 Good! 
 Use the other one. 
 What? 
 The other boy. Use him if you must. 
 Very well. 
 We'll take the LITTLE boy! 
 Sahib? 
 That's right. Come on! 
 Come on, get a move on. 
 Sahib, what are we doing? 
 It's all right. 
 Sugar. For pluck. 
 Go on, go. Go! 
 The child has nothing to fear. 
 We will defend him as if he was our own son. 
 Tell me, Whelan, will your sister be joining us for supper tonight? 
 She's busy, I'm afraid, Your Highness. 
 Kindly tell her to change her plans. 
 No. That won't be possible. 
 Shall we? 
 Beggars belief that you would use a poor child like that as bait. 
 You insisted on it. 
 Practical joke, old man. 
 Just wanted to see how far you'd go. 
 And, by George, you bally well did. 
 How's your aim? 
 More of a cricketer. 
 Just as I feared. 
 'Fire!' 
 Bhupi. 
 I don't know why you're making such a fuss. 
 That son of yours was never in any danger. 
 What was that? Bhupi! 
 If there's no danger, why not tie Adam to the post? 
 That's enough. 
 Al! 
 Thanks for doing this. 
 I thought you wanted me here. 
 Change of plan. 
 The Prince is an unpredictable force. 
 It's just for one night. 
 Hands off! You're wet. 
 Sorry. 
 Ah. 
 Pity your Mr Dalal's not here to help. 
 He's always very good at these sorts of dinners. 
 Yes. 
 What? 
 I want you to avoid him. 
 Dalal. I mean, when he gets back from Quetta. 
 May I know why? 
 In confidence? 
 Sure. 
 I'm serious. Not a word to a soul. 
 All right. 
 When he was in Bengal, Dalal got mixed up with some traitors. 
 Agitators. 
 By all rights, he should be behind bars by now, standing trial. 
 What will you do? 
 I've given him an ultimatum -- till he gets back from Quetta, he's either with us, with the administration, heart and soul... or he leaves town, starts a new life. 
 You think I'm being too lenient? 
 No. He's our friend. 
 I say, Muddle! 
 Here he comes, the Pied Piper! 
 Shall we go? 
 A night at the club. 
 I can't wait. 
 Here they are! 
 Ah! 
 Speak of the devil. 
 Only joking! 
 Afternoon, Mrs S. 
 How's that brother of yours getting on with his royal guest? 
 Oh, what guest is that, then? 
 The Maharajah of Amritpur. 
 Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. 
 Dear old Ralph, still hoping for a miracle. 
 They've been off hunting. 
 Oh. Must have cost a pretty penny. 
 Yes. Yes, it did, as a matter of fact. 
 Now, Mr H, might I borrow your wife? 
 If you must. 
 Come on. There's someone to see you. 
 Sarah! 
 Shh. He just went off. 
 What's his name? 
 Ernest. 
 He looks just like his daddy. 
 Does he? Well, I happen to think he looks like himself. 
 Sarah, I'm so sorry about your husband. 
 When I heard what happened, well, I mean... 
 I couldn't make head or tail of any of it. 
 Of course. 
 Did you...? 
 Was I there? No. 
 No, but everyone says it was a tragic accident. 
 Yes, what does that actually mean? 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 'Ello, Ernie, love! 
 Shh! 
 It's Ernest. 
 Yeah. That's just what I said. 
 So, yes, I heard poor Mrs Raworth here was staying down at the Cecil Hotel. 
 I mean, the place is crawling with tourists of every possible complexion Stay at ours. 
 Thank you. I'm not a charity case, Mrs Havistock. 
 Oh, no, no, no, quite right she'll stay up here. 
 Now, I had Kaiser dig this out of retirement. 
 It's an old one of mine, but it's a very fine silk. 
 No, no, I'm sorry, I'm not going about like some creature at a zoo. 
 Anyway, it's far too big for little, old me. 
 Oh, right. Well, whatever you say, dear. 
 Um, I should get ready. 
 Oh, yeah, Mrs Raworth's elder son's on his way up, isn't that right? 
 Matthew? He's back in India? 
 Yes. Not long now. 
 Oh, what wonderful news. 
 It's silly, isn't it? What if I don't recognise him? 
 I won't know what to say, will I? 
 So I'm going to need some help. 
 Can we fetch my old ayah back? 
 Well, yeah, I expect something can be arranged, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, Sooni, I'm going to say this only once. 
 Ma, when did you ever say anything once? 
 Today, there is going to be no talk of Gandhiji, no talk of Pandit Nehru, no talk about the rights of man or woman. 
 Everybody knows a clever wife brings no peace to the house. 
 So? 
 Yes, it's a thumping tune. 
 What do I always say, Boman? 
 Practise, practise, Auntie. 
 Practise, practise! 
 So, what about all your little hobbies, Sooni? 
 Er, well, my sister used to play piano. 
 And what about you, honey? 
 Sooni's a very fine artist. 
 What? 
 In fact, I just happen to have, by chance, one or two things... here. 
 Have a look. 
 And how did you learn to draw like this, Sooni? 
 I didn't. 
 It's a gift. She's gifted. 
 Well, perhaps one day very soon, you will get to draw Boman. 
 No, Auntie, I'd be a waste of a good pencil. 
 Most particularly, the eyebrows. 
 I tell you, we're so lucky to at least be here in one piece. 
 And why is that? 
 Gandhi! 
 They didn't allow him to visit up in Quetta, thank God, so now the sly fellow is planning some kind of vigil down in Ambala, so our train got delayed, and all this for what? 
 Well... 
 My son is in Quetta. 
 My God! Whatever is he doing up there? 
 What is it, jaanu? 
 He's co-ordinating the relief effort. 
 When the supplies are running low, he will tell them. 
 Well... that sounds like... useful work... and, er, not at all dangerous. 
 
 
 
 Your Highness! 
 Whelan. 
 Welcome to our home. 
 Didn't I tell you, Manu? 
 Charming little house. 
 Thank you. 
 Ralph. 
 Sirene. 
 Madeleine! 
 Sirene. 
 I'd be happy to give you a tour of the grounds, Your Highness. 
 Hm. 
 I let the driver go. Given him the night off. 
 This is beautiful. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 I have to be honest. 
 I cannot draw to save my life. 
 You are very modest. 
 No, those pictures are my brother's work. He is the artist. 
 Well, if I can be honest, too, I am a hopeless musician. 
 The instrument was my father's, and that song is the whole length and breadth of my repertoire. 
 Well, I'm glad we can be honest. 
 I, too. 
 Now, tell me... 
 Yes? 
 .. what is it you want from a wife? 
 Children... friendship... happiness at home. 
 All good things. What else? 
 A woman who is not afraid to challenge her husband. 
 Oh! Then may I challenge you now? 
 Wait, shouldn't we be getting back? 
 You see, when I think about you and your lovely home in Delhi, I have to wonder, will it ever be enough... for me? 
 Sooni, I would bring home all my case files. 
 We could work on them together, if you like, after the children are put to bed. 
 The children... 
 And you would be a lawyer, active and fulfilled, in all but name. 
 Thank you. 
 Forgive me, are you Miss Dalal? 
 What? 
 Er... 
 Yes, I am Miss Dalal?! 
 Well, in that case, your father has asked me to convey you home directly. Shall we go? 
 My father? 
 I am stark raving mad, Miss Dalal. I have no idea what I am saying. 
 Don't stand there, please. What are you waiting for? 
 "When, when, when will you rise to the occasion, Mr Khan?" 
 Do you remember saying those words to me? 
 Not particularly. 
 Well, it's a question that haunts me, and do you know, after your visit today, when you came to me in such distress, I realised if I am ever to be of merit, if I'm ever to rise above picnics or flower shows... it requires a little daring. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I am talking about you. Your happiness. Your good feeling. 
 What?! 
 "How did the rose ever open its heart?" 
 Come. I have arranged a vehicle. 
 Where are we going? 
 Trust me. 
 You seem off your game, old boy. 
 I admit I'm puzzled. 
 If you're so dead against the terms of the bill, why honour us with the visit? 
 As a courtesy to my old friend the Viceroy. 
 He said to me, "Talk to the boy, the young man. Hear what he has to say." 
 Thank you. 
 Now, as you're aware, the Chamber of Princes meet in a few weeks. 
 I might be able to persuade them to believe in this brave new world of yours. 
 In order to do that, I need something in return. 
 Yes? What's that? 
 Lend me your wife. 
 What? 
 Not forever. Just for an evening. 
 Oh, I see. It's another one of your practical jokes. 
 Not this time. 
 What point are you trying to make this time? 
 No point at all, Whelan. 
 I like the look of her. 
 I thought it might be fun. 
 There he is! Matthew! At last! 
 Oh, my dear! 
 Hello, Mother. 
 Oh, my darling! 
 Look how you've... I promised I wouldn't say it! 
 He's like a young man! He IS a young man! 
 Ayah? Is that you? 
 Sahib. 
 Matthew, for God's sake. 
 Look at that. Cat's got her tongue. 
 Sahib? 
 She doesn't know what to call you! 
 Don't laugh at her. 
 So come on, let's go. 
 Ayah... 
 What is it? What's the matter? 
 It's just the white sari. 
 What about it? 
 Well, I thought... 
 I thought it meant... 
 Is she in mourning for someone? 
 Oh, I shouldn't think so. 
 Was it someone from your village? 
 Memsahib? 
 All these questions. Golly! 
 Where's Father? 
 Honestly, love, can't I just see you for one minute without him spoiling everything? 
 Well, how do you mean? 
 Excuse me, I just have to... 
 Where are you going? 
 Sahib. 
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 Matthew, I'm so sorry, love. 
 I tried writing. 
 What's going on? What happened? 
 I don't know, do I? 
 Everyone says it was an accident. 
 Come on, put your hat on. 
 Yes, please. 
 Put it on, put it on! 
 So what you're saying is... 
 The Viceroy was here, enjoying his jubilee. 
 Guests scattered about. 
 I was going to eat that! 
 That's about the sum of it. 
 And the bomb? 
 Here? 
 Here? 
 It's a pity you weren't there to see it first hand. 
 Anyway, it wasn't a bomb. 
 Not as such. 
 Oh, I beg your pardon. 
 What was it, then? 
 Well... 
 There was a boy. 
 He discovered these explosives, He thought it was a game. 
 Well, that makes perfect sense. 
 Yeah, when you put it like that. 
 It was a dreadful accident. 
 Oh, perfect. 
 An accident. 
 Boy! 
 Try telling that to the poor fellow who kicked the bucket. 
 Oh, God, look what he's done now. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's fine. 
 Come with me. 
 Bhupi, do you see what you're doing? 
 Sabotaging my evening the one time I need everyone at their best. 
 I cannot serve that man. 
 Fine. Go on. Get lost. 
 Clear off. Go and sulk in your room. 
 What is wrong with everyone? 
 Everyone's fine, it's just that clumsy oaf. 
 You're right. It's not Bhupi's fault, it's mine. 
 It's just, the Prince, well, he... he said something, erm... inexcusable. 
 What? 
 Tell me. 
 I can't. 
 Say it. 
 He more or less said, knowing how much I need his support, he'd only give us his backing for the Bill if you agreed, volunteered... to spend a few hours in his company. 
 Doing what? 
 Jesus. 
 How deliciously modern! 
 I know, it's funny. It OUGHT to be funny... 
 So what did you say? 
 Naturally I told him to get out of the house immediately. 
 What a cheek. 
 Obviously, we just carry on like nothing's happened. 
 We try and get through it. 
 I just find it galling, the idea that everyone would know except you. 
 And the job? 
 It doesn't matter about the job. Who cares about the job? 
 Nothing matters except you. 
 Come on. 
 Oh! 
 See how he spoils me! 
 I stole it from my wife. 
 I... I thought Sirene was your wife. 
 Oh, no. 
 She's a temporary wife. 
 This is her pension. 
 She can pawn it for dollars when she gets back to her one-horse town. 
 Come on. That's not funny. 
 Don't move. 
 Now, this... 
 This... belonged to my mother. 
 I... can't accept it. I'm sorry. 
 How does Mrs Whelan look, Phyllis? 
 Divine. 
 And what does Mr Whelan say? 
 We'll treasure it, won't we, darling? 
 You know, I... I have the most wretched headache coming on. 
 Oh, have a drink. It'll pass. 
 Not this kind. 
 You all go on without me. 
 Oh, no, Mads, we wouldn't dream of it. 
 Come on, we should push off. 
 Mm. 
 Mm, we'll need to borrow your driver, of course. 
 Ralph... 
 You sure you don't want a nightcap? 
 What would be the point? 
 We'll talk again in the morning. 
 I have an early start. 
 Ralph. 
 Thank you for a pleasant evening. 
 You're welcome. 
 Where's this damn driver? 
 Bhupi! 
 Lazy fool. 
 I'll go chase him up. 
 You're going nowhere in those heels. 
 It's not a problem. 
 Whelan. 
 Be a gentleman and go and fetch the damn chap. 
 Yes. Go. 
 All right. 
 So... 
 We hope to see you down in Delhi? 
 Bhupi. 
 I think my husband's offended. 
 As is mine. 
 Oh, come on, Madeline, don't be so wet. 
 I mean, we're women of the world. 
 I'm not in your world. 
 (That's put you in your place.) 
 Well, I didn't think she was so old-fashioned, did you? 
 I'm not. 
 'We thought you were a free-thinker. 
 'Liberated.' 
 I am. 
 In the end, he won't forgive you. 
 You think he will. 
 But he won't. 
 Damn it. 
 Oh, come on, let's go. 
 There he is. 
 It's all right. 
 We don't need him just yet. 
 Madeleine? 
 It's fine. 
 I'm fine. 
 You see? 
 All is well. 
 So... 
 Your Highness... 
 Where do you want to do this? 
 What is he saying? I can't hear anything. 
 He says, "Be hopeful." 
 He says, "We are one whole nation. 
 "One people, without taint of division, under God." 
 You see, everything is possible. 
 Yes. 
 Sooni. 
 I love you. 
 I want to see this world as you do. 
 I want you to be and do everything you can and will and must. 
 No, I want it left open. 
 My child is down the hall. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, come on. Where's your self-respect, you f*cking worm? 
 Is this what you like? 
 Is this what you want? 
 You tell me. Why's he doing it? 
 Why's he doing it? 
 I don't think he likes you very much. 
 I wouldn't do that if I were you. 
 She's made her sacrifice. 
 Who knows? She might even enjoy it. 
 Old Manu, he's like a bear with a honeypot. 
 You know, it was your sister he really wanted. 
 So I gather. 
 You see, this is how I like them, like this. 
 What, when they're asleep? 
 No, no, I meant when they're peaceful! 
 You never wanted children of your own? 
 Yeah, I wanted them. 
 What wife doesn't? 
 But in... In... Well, I couldn't, that's all. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 So your husband's a proper so-and-so, isn't he? 
 Cor. 
 Why we put up with them all... 
 They weren't so different, your Reggie and my Mr H. 
 No, they weren't. 
 And is that why you've been helping me with Aafrin? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 You see, I was just stuck indoors all the time and he was out there, up on his fine horse, in a world full of temptation. 
 Some nights he'd come home and he'd give me a little present, you see. 
 That's what he actually called it. 
 A little present. 
 Well, it wasn't a very nice present. 
 No. 
 Should've got himself checked out first. 
 That would have been the gentlemanly thing. 
 Checked out? 
 Yes, dear, by a doctor. 
 And you know what was was worse? 
 He used to shrug them all off. 
 All his little conditions. 
 Oh, yeah, he was very proud of his health. 
 But I couldn't. 
 Not me. 
 Too weak. 
 I tried. I honestly did try. 
 One, two, three little babies. 
 They come out, poor little mites. 
 Not one blessed breath between them. 
 In the end he just laughed. 
 The last time. 
 Laughed in the face of a dead child. 
 Anyway, where was I? 
 I'll go find the ayah. 
 Here we are. Oh... 
 Oh, now, here's Mummy. 
 Come on, you'll want to see him. Oh. 
 Don't drop him. 
 Oh, I wouldn't do that. Look at them. Come on. Come on. 
 Yeah. I think we can manage from here. Thank you. 
 Come on. Come on, darling. 
 Oh, aaah! Here you go, darling. 
 Look at that. 
 Two brothers. 
 Come here, darling. 
 Come to Mamma. Yes, my sweet boy. 
 Good boy. 
 Ralph, will you do something for me? 
 Anything. 
 Will you tell me why is it you even want this job? 
 It was my father's dying wish. 
 Is that it? 
 Is that all you've got? 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What about what you want or think or feel? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I've worked for it... so long. 
 It's too late to change. 
 Well, it is now. 
 Where are you going? 
 To take a bath. 
 I hope you get what you want. 
 Son. 
 Wake up. 
 Get up. 
 What are we aiming to hit? 
 Shoot and you'll soon find out. 
 See what I mean?
