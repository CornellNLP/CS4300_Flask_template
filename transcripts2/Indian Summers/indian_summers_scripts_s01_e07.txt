 The Hindus play by their own rules - we keep our noses out of it. 
 'It's been ten years.' 
 'You can't stay here - you must see that?' 
 'But tonight, I want you to finally meet your son.' 
 Why don't you make me a list? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Any repair work around the school, I'll put in a word with the board of revenue. 
 Will your father be coming to the wedding? 
 See, right now, I'm afraid he'd have trouble raising the funds. 
 Take this - it's important. 
 Sita, you promised me you'll give that letter to my sister? 
 Yes. 
 You stole the evidence connecting that terrorist with Congress. 
 What will you do? 
 I don't know. 
 Out! Get him out! 
 'Under no circumstances will you work under a native.' 
 'The thief took an article that was very dear to me. 
 'It was my late wife's wedding sari.' 
 You came!  (She screams) 
 If she were to be taken away... 
 She'd only come back. 
 (Children chatter) 
 Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers - neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will separate us from the word of God. 
 Indeed. 
 I know her... I mean, I've seen her before. 
 Where? 
 A few weeks ago. 
 She was on the road to Huttoo Peak and more recently at the Viceregal Lodge. 
 Did anyone else see her there? 
 Ralph Whelan himself. 
 (Crowd chatters) 
 Ah. Are you ready, sir? 
 Yes, although I'm afraid I must apologise in advance, I'm not sure I'll be much help. 
 Oh! 
 It was very dark, you see. And... well, I'm guessing Mr Raworth drank considerably less than I did that night. 
 (Footsteps approach) 
 (Door opens) 
 (Door closes) 
 I'm afraid I just can't be certain. I'm sorry. 
 Right, I'm sorry for wasting your time, sir. 
 She's been through the wars, see? 
 I thought these killed her, but the Medical Officer says they're old injuries. 
 Years old. Would you like to... 
 No, I wouldn't. 
 Never seen anything like it. Probably an untouchable. 
 Hm. 
 (Knock at door) 
 Sir... 
 Excuse me. I'll be back in a moment. 
 (Door closes) 
 (He sobs) 
 No! No! 
 No, no! 
 You're a sight for sore eyes. 
 Absolutely gorgeous. 
 Funny. Where have you been? I haven't seen you for days. 
 That witch has banned me from the club, you know. 
 I heard. You don't believe in making things easy for yourself. 
 Oh, she has it in for me. 
 Christ, this place. 
 You know... I should go home. 
 Because you're less likely to drink yourself to death in Scotland? 
 (He chuckles) 
 Pff... 
 We certainly have a better quality of poison. 
 Oh, did you hear? They found a body in the river this morning. 
 Who was it? 
 I'm not sure. Some local. 
 You suffocate, you know. 
 If you drown, I mean. That's how you actually die. 
 (He groans) 
 How many eggs do you want? 
 I don't have much of an appetite. 
 Nonsense. 
 But the real question is, what was she doing down by the river, alone, on her wedding night? 
 Her wedding night? 
 People are saying she was wearing a wedding dress, well... sari. 
 Jesus. 
 Dalal? 
 I'm sorry to disturb you, sir. This arrived from Yeravda jail. 
 I thought you'd want to see it immediately. 
 Why didn't you show it to Mr Keane? 
 Mr Keane is rehearsing, sir. 
 Rehearsing? Oh. Of course. 
 Wonderful. 
 Where did this charitable gentleman, charitable gentleman, who had this first-class ticket to this seaside resort, find you? 
 In a handbag? 
 A handbag? 
 Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a handbag. 
 A somewhat large, black, leather handbag, with handles to it - an ordinary handbag in fact. 
 Your Excellency, we're almost finished with this scene and then we'll move straight to yours... 
 I'm ready now, Mr Keane. 
 Of course. Yes, of course. My apologies, sir. 
 Get up! 
 So, moving on. 
 Could we turn to act three, where we left off yesterday? 
 Cecily is the dearest, sweetest... 
 On the left. No, my left. 
 Stage right. 
 Kaiser! 
 Sahib. 
 Could we please make sure... 
 Style is often determined by the wearing of the chin... 
 Never mind. 
 And it is worn very high... 
 Yes, Aunt Augusta! 
 No, I haven't finished. I... 
 Cecily is the dearest, prettiest... 
 We've skipped a bit. 
 .. sweetest girl in the whole world. 
 Skipped one of my bits. 
 And I don't care twopence for social possibilities. 
 Never speak disrespectfully of the Royal Simla Club, Algernon. 
 Only people who can't get in do that. 
 (They laugh) 
 Sorry, Cynthia. "Society." 
 The line is, "Never speak disrespectfully of society." 
 You accidentally said... 
 No, I didn't accidentally say anything. 
 I've added a few little bits and pieces... 
 Come again? 
 A few of my own jokes. 
 I think Mr Wilde has given us quite enough jokes to be getting on with. 
 Well, I disagree. 
 It's really starting to come together, isn't it? 
 No! My left! How many times?! 
 I suppose. 
 Shall we have some tea? 
 I should really learn my lines. 
 My goodness but you've really taken to this. 
 I practically had to drag her to the auditions... 
 Is that so? 
 Now look, she can't tear herself away. 
 Maybe I could do with a little break. 
 Oh, good! 
 She brought you to the auditions? 
 Alice, why can't you say no to that woman? 
 (Well, come on, then.) 
 Let's just have some tea. 
 You can't just change the script without telling anyone. 
 Well, I'm telling you now. Anyway, don't you worry about me. 
 Concentrate on yourself. 
 Dressing room! That should be in the dressing room. 
 Oh. Let's take a break. 
 What on earth do you plan to do? 
 About what? 
 About Wooden Features. 
 Stop this. Eugene's fine. 
 Ronnie, he's awful. He's worse than awful. 
 Why do you have it in for him? 
 I do not "have it in" for anyone. 
 I am simply concerned about the production. You'll have to recast. 
 No chance. The first performance is days away. 
 I'm not replacing anybody. 
 Oh, Ronnie, you will be replacing someone. 
 Him or me. 
 Your choice. 
 DOOR SLAMS Excuse me. 
 I need to speak to Mr Rowntree. 
 I think you mean Superintendent Rowntree? 
 They're the same person, no? 
 Or is this place coming down with Rowntrees? 
 Can you not see the wood for the Rowntrees? 
 You are unwell, sir? 
 Look, this is important. 
 It's about the body you found in the river this morning. 
 So can you take me to him, please? 
 Who was she? 
 Nobody. 
 Nobody knows. Nobody knows who she was. 
 She worked on the tea estate... 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm positive. It's definitely her. 
 Do you know her name? 
 I don't... I'm afraid I don't remember. 
 I suppose there's no reason why you should. 
 You weren't to know she'd turn up dead, were you? 
 That's true. 
 It's unbelievable. I was told she'd drowned. 
 I assumed it was an accident. 
 The shutters are stuck, sir. 
 Oh, just leave it. 
 Had she been on the tea estate long? 
 Not long at all. A few weeks at most, then she left. 
 Well, we thought she left. 
 So she left suddenly? 
 Aye, but nobody thought that was odd. 
 You see, she'd broken into Ramu's premises and stolen from him. 
 His wife's wedding dress, of all things. 
 So we weren't expecting her to come back. She couldn't. 
 Ramu Sood? The man you work for? 
 Work WITH. The man I work with. 
 I didn't realise he was married. 
 Neither did I. She passed away... the wife. 
 So, this woman stole his dead wife's wedding gown? 
 He must have been very angry. 
 Well, he found it upsetting. 
 I'm sure he did. And Mr Sood, did he confront her? 
 He didn't get a chance to. She'd gone. 
 Did he look for her? 
 Yes, but he didn't find her. Like I said, she'd gone. 
 Not far. She didn't go far, Mr McLeod. 
 Did you help him in his search? 
 No. 
 So when he said he didn't find her, we only have his word for it? 
 Well, why would he lie? 
 Exactly, yes. I'm sure he would have had no reason to. 
 Well, thank you, Mr McLeod. You've been very helpful. 
 Ralph. 
 Oh, perfect timing. We're just having a little break. 
 Sorry, Madeleine, I can't. Not now. 
 [So ideally, sir, You'd wait until the person before you had...] 
 [.. completely finished speaking and then....] 
 Ralph!... fancy a sneak preview, did you? 
 Not exactly. 
 His Excellency has just been rehearsing. 
 And very good he was too. 
 Such an honour. 
 Good afternoon, sir. 
 I've had a letter from our friend in Yervada jail. 
 The hunger strike? 
 Which as of Sunday, will no longer be just a threat. 
 "One voice for all Hindus." The man is simply trying to keep the untouchables in their place. Those who think otherwise are fools. 
 Well, those fools are numerous. 
 Your play... it opens on Sunday? 
 You know it does. 
 Would you be willing to postpone? 
 Why? 
 You don't think it could appear disrespectful? 
 Disrespectful? To who? Gandhi? Oh, my God, Ralph. 
 It's not a British matter. 
 It concerns the Indians of the higher castes and the untouchables. 
 We promised the untouchables representation, we promised them a voice. 
 Or have you forgotten that? Because they won't have. 
 Gandhi goes on hunger strike, and that very night all of British Simla dons its finery and heads to the theatre? 
 He starves himself while we drink and dine and laugh. 
 We will not involve ourselves. 
 Avoiding ill feeling is vital at the moment, surely you can see that. 
 You postpone this play and you will cause ill feeling Ralph... amongst your own people. 
 It's a play. 
 It's tradition. 
 I'm not saying cancel... 
 It's not a British matter, and changing our plans might suggest otherwise. 
 They'll tear themselves apart over this, and we will be the stronger for it. 
 We keep our heads down and we carry on. 
 Or rather, close our eyes and turn our backs. 
 Because that's how the untouchables will see it. 
 I will hear no more about it. 
 This discussion is over. 
 Is that understood? 
 Sir? 
 Why don't you follow the Viceroy and punch him squarely in the face? 
 I mean, you seem so determined to end your career, there's absolutely no point in dragging it out. 
 Jaya's dead. 
 What? 
 Dead? 
 The police just showed me her body. 
 I said I didn't know who she was. 
 In many ways I didn't, really. 
 What happened? 
 She was stabbed. Somebody killed her. 
 What else did you say? To the police, I mean? 
 Nothing. 
 Ian McLeod was there. 
 What, why? 
 I don't know. Perhaps he saw something. 
 Right. 
 The past always catches up with you. 
 That's what people say, isn't it? 
 Ralph, you've got to stop that, now. 
 You have to get a handle on this. And quick. 
 Do you understand? 
 Everything is going to be fine. 
 I promise. 
 When you're not here, I often catch him sitting there. 
 Perhaps he is pretending to be you. 
 What a very dull game that must be. 
 Poor child. 
 He is better off without her. 
 Forgive me. I shouldn't have said that. 
 The police don't know she was his mother. 
 I kept it from them. 
 I thought he could do without their insensitive prodding. 
 Was that very wrong of me? 
 No. I would have done the same. 
 I mean, you've been doing so much lately. 
 You know, you're carrying this place on your shoulders, Leena. 
 That isn't true. 
 What is it? 
 It's from the board of revenue. 
 They have been more generous than I expected. Much more. 
 Yes. And it seems we have Ralph Whelan to thank for it. 
 This is a godsend. 
 This is food, and clothing, medicine and books, new books, Dougie. 
 Yes. 
 We certainly can't afford to turn it down. 
 Why would we? 
 I don't... no... I don't know... 
 I'm sorry I'm late. The stupid play. 
 It's ridiculous. 
 Am I interrupting? 
 No. Come in. 
 Your brother has thrown us the lifeline we so desperately needed, Miss Whelan. 
 Ralph sent this? 
 Yes. 
 He's taken quite an interest in the school of late. 
 I see. 
 (Man speaks own language) 
 You are no good... 
 Pleasure as always, Prakash. 
 You dare to show your face, then? 
 Or perhaps you weren't expecting me. Perhaps you thought they'd already dragged me away? 
 What's happening? 
 You should know better than I do. It's your story after all? 
 You went to the police. You told them I killed that woman. 
 I didn't! Of course I didn't. 
 Who said that? 
 They did. 
 They've been here? 
 Oh, they've been here all right. They've been in here with me, they've been in the fields with my workers. 
 "Does Mr Sood have a temper? Do you fear Mr Sood?" 
 They work quickly when they want to. 
 You know I could hang for this? 
 No, Ramu, listen, I told them she worked here, and they asked why she left. 
 That's it. That's all. 
 I was trying to help. 
 You are either very stupid Mr McLeod or very, very clever... 
 What? 
 Things would be a lot easier for you here if I were to disappear, no? 
 Have you actually gone mad? 
 Ramu, this is what happened, the police spoke to you... then they left. 
 You're overreacting. They didn't arrest you. 
 They will. 
 They have no evidence. 
 They'll find it. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You had nothing to do with that woman's death. 
 I'm glad you think so McLeod. 
 I will always remember that... and take that with me. 
 The worst thing an innocent man can do is run. 
 This makes no sense to me. 
 Of course it doesn't. How could it? 
 How could you possibly understand? 
 Well, they're searching for Ramu Sood as we speak, apparently. 
 According to Stella, Mr McLeod suspected Sood of being involved, and he came forward. 
 Thank God. I always said he was a decent sort. 
 I've asked Rowntree to release Jaya's body for cremation... 
 Good idea. The sooner that happens the better. 
 The last thing we need is someone else recognising her, and asking more questions. 
 I did it because it was proper. 
 Because it was fitting. 
 I loved her once. 
 Ralph, you have to forget about that now. 
 You have to forget about her. 
 I know you only ever wanted to protect me. 
 Yes, and I always will. 
 And I know what you thought of Jaya. 
 But that's all in the past. 
 When she turned up again, do you know what scared me the most? 
 I realised how stupid I'd been back then. 
 I could have lost everything because of her. 
 I think, at one stage, I was prepared to. 
 You hated her for that, didn't you? 
 SHE LAUGHS What is it? 
 You think I killed her, don't you? 
 No, I... 
 Why are you laughing? 
 Because I'm glad. I'm glad you think that. 
 You're glad? 
 Oh, God, Ralph. 
 I have been so worried. 
 I feared the worst. 
 But if you think I killed Jaya, it means you didn't. 
 You didn't. 
 I know why you're doing this. 
 It's pathetic, Cynthia. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Since I told you about my family's financial situation, you've had very little time for me, Cynthia. 
 Is that why you don't want me in the play? 
 Because I'm broke? 
 I don't want you in the play because you can't act, Eugene. 
 Do you see? You're bad. You are very, very bad. 
 You know what, Cynthia? You're not so great yourself! 
 For you. 
 From whom? 
 Mr Whelan. 
 
 
 
 Sergeant Singh... I'm afraid Mr Whelan's out at the moment. I can take a message for him, though, if you'd like. 
 I don't wish to speak to Mr Whelan. 
 Oh... Well, who do you wish to speak to? 
 You, Mr Dalal. 
 And how can I help you? 
 Choose a hand. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Choose a hand. 
 Er... 
 Bad luck. 
 Had you had chosen this one... you would have won the prize. 
 I don't... 
 What is that? 
 You don't know? Strange. 
 It was hidden in a little box at your father's house. 
 If you didn't put it there, who did, I wonder? 
 Your father, perhaps? That must be quite a worry for you. 
 Stealing evidence. Punishment for such a crime is severe. 
 And I understand he is not very well. 
 You leave my father alone! 
 Please, Mr Dalal. It was not my intention to distress you. 
 I shall leave. 
 But we will speak again. 
 Come in. Come in. Sit down. 
 I must admit your invitation was the last thing I was expecting. 
 Look... I'm not often wrong. 
 But when I am wrong... 
 Well, I never, ever say I'm wrong. 
 I see. 
 And what have you not been wrong about? 
 You. 
 The truth is, the woman they found in the river... 
 Oh, I haven't been able to stop thinking about the unfortunate soul. 
 It's very, very difficult to make sense of something like this when it happens. 
 So, when the police caught that man, if you can call him a man, so quickly... well, it gave me some small comfort. 
 Cynthia... 
 And I believe they had no idea who they should be looking for, until they spoke to you, Mr McLeod. 
 I really don't deserve any praise for that. 
 Why not? 
 Because it wasn't my intention. 
 This story's taken on a life of its own. 
 I didn't arrive at the police station and loudly proclaim Ramu's guilt. 
 I just answered their questions. 
 I didn't, for a second, think that Ramu was connected to that girl's death. 
 I'm still having trouble believing it. 
 But why did he run? 
 Why did he confess? 
 He confessed? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Which is something, I suppose. 
 I guess he thought he'd got away with it once. 
 He wasn't going to get away with it again. 
 Like your poor uncle. 
 I mean, he'd still be alive if it wasn't for that animal. 
 I don't want you to forget that. 
 He confessed? 
 Whatever your intention... you did the right thing. 
 And I would like it if we could start over. 
 Does that mean I'd be welcome back here? 
 Of course! 
 And can I drink too much and shout abuse at people? 
 I fully insist upon it! 
 Well, then, that's this afternoon sorted, eh? 
 Unless I could make you a better offer... 
 If you're game, that is. 
 It is very painful for me to speak the truth. 
 It's the first time in my life I have been reduced to such a painful position. 
 I have no brother, Ernest. 
 I have no brother at all. 
 I have never had a brother in my life. 
 I have never had a brother in my life and I certainly have not the smallest intention of having one in the future. 
 Great. Let's stop there for a moment. 
 That was wonderful, Sarah. Just wonderful. 
 Very funny stuff. 
 Well done, you. 
 No need to go overboard. 
 Cynthia, could you please stop eating the props. 
 Sorry. 
 You really think you'll be able to learn all this on time? 
 Of course he can. 
 The whole thing's already in better shape because of you. 
 Oh, come now. 
 No, I mean it. I don't know what we would have done without you. 
 You must come to the club for your dinner. 
 There's no need. 
 No! No, I insist. 
 And I'll invite the others, as well. Welcome you back properly. 
 Where the hell is Alice? 
 (Baby cries) 
 I'm so late. 
 Sssh... It's all right. 
 Please, ma'am... 
 All right. 
 This stupid play. 
 He's tired, ma'am, that's all. You go. 
 I'll be back soon, sweetheart. 
 (Baby continues to cry) 
 My God! You made me jump! 
 What are you doing here? 
 How could I have been such a fool? 
 You told the police about the note, about what I did. You told them. 
 What? 
 Aafrin, stop this. Let me go. 
 Have you any idea what you've done? 
 I haven't done anything. 
 You told them. Don't lie to me. 
 I haven't said anything, to anybody. 
 How else would they know? 
 I wasn't the only person who helped you that night, as far as I remember. 
 You're suggesting Sita betrayed me? 
 The woman I love? 
 The woman I intend to marry? 
 I trust Sita with my life. 
 Whereas, I am not to be trusted? 
 No, you are not. 
 How dare you. 
 You're just like the rest of them. 
 Of course, in those days, I wasn't directing. I was acting. 
 Oh, I hadn't realised you'd tread the boards, Mr Keane. 
 Many times. I can't even remember all the roles I've played. 
 Oberon, A Midsummer Night's Dream. 
 I was Benedick in Much Ado. That was good. 
 Oh! 
 That was a good one. 
 Petruchio, Taming Of The Shrew... 
 The police have closed off the land around Ramu's house, apparently. 
 Is that so? 
 It's true. I tried to come that way tonight. 
 Well, that's where he did it, then, isn't it? 
 He killed the poor girl in his own back yard, then dumped her body in the river. 
 It's all so grim... 
 You seem to have a morbid fascination with the details, Cynthia. 
 He did it. We need know nothing beyond that. 
 Where it happened isn't important. 
 I don't have a morbid fascination. 
 I'm not so sure... 
 I think where it happened could be very important. 
 Why do you say that? 
 The night this here girl was murdered, I'd been at Ramu's bungalow. 
 And when I walked home that way, I heard a noise... a scream. 
 I didn't know what it was at the time, but now... I think I do. 
 You think you heard the murder? 
 And the thing is... I looked back at the bungalow and he, Ramu, was on his porch. 
 I saw him. I waved at him. 
 Had you been drinking that night, Mr McLeod? 
 I'm not judging you. 
 I enjoy a drink myself. 
 And when I've over-indulged... I hear things sometimes. 
 Christ, I even see things sometimes. 
 Mr McLeod, if you weigh up your drunken, retrospective insights against the very real evidence gathered by the police, you'll find they have little substance. 
 Don't waste anyone's time on this. 
 Look at this face. The concentration. 
 It's only a card game, love. 
 Hm! 
 Cynthia, what came after King Lear? 
 We do not speak of Lear. 
 Have you ever performed in a play, Ralph? 
 Do you know me at all, Madeleine? 
 He'd make a good Romeo, don't you think? 
 I mean, he'd certainly fill out a pair of tights. 
 So dull. 
 I'll eat at home. 
 Excuse me. 
 It starts at half past seven, the play. 
 You will remember, won't you? 
 Of course. 
 You've written it down? 
 I've written it down. 
 It's just, I don't want you to miss it. 
 Well, I don't want Matthew to miss it. 
 It might be fun for him, seeing me up there. 
 I'm sure he'll love it. 
 Ronnie says I'm a natural. 
 Well, I'd better turn in. I've got that funeral at dawn. 
 Whose funeral? 
 Sorry, cremation. 
 The woman that the children from the school discovered. 
 Oh, you mean the Indian... 
 Ah! There it is. 
 Yes. 
 Good night, Sarah. 
 Night. 
 (Chants in native language) 
 Thank you for coming. 
 You don't need to thank me. 
 I'm glad you decided to bring them. 
 It's important they know she is at peace. 
 I just hope it helps. 
 They've all been having trouble sleeping, especially Ruth. 
 I didn't realise little Adam had been with them. 
 He wasn't. 
 Then, why is he here? 
 You don't know? Douglas hasn't told you? 
 Told me what? 
 She was Adam's mother. 
 Stop! 
 (It's all right.) 
 I cannot believe you are even considering going. 
 Child, he can't just ignore an invitation from the Private Secretary. 
 Oh, of course. He must stay on side. 
 Nothing must affect Aafrin's precious position. 
 That's quite enough, Sooni. 
 Can't you see you are being used? 
 He parades a few of his little Indian pets and says, "Look, we are including you. Aren't we nice? Aren't you lucky?" 
 I am nobody's pet. 
 If we let them divide us, then they win. 
 It is how they have always won. 
 Gandhi wants us to be united, as one. 
 And you will sit among them while he starves for that cause? 
 It is not that simple! 
 Now, stop it, both of you. 
 Can't you see how it's upsetting your father? 
 Huh? 
 Sooni... 
 Please, I don't want to argue with you. 
 It's too late for that. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Do you remember, some time ago, I asked you about a note? 
 A note you received from Sita. 
 Are you going to that play tonight? 
 Sooni, this is important. 
 So is this. Are you going? 
 I must. 
 Then I have nothing to say to you. 
 Sooni...! 
 Radio : His fast, which aims to highlight the treatment of the Untouchables, began today. 
 Speaking from his prison cell at... 
 Are you excited? 
 I could barely sleep last night. 
 I hope I don't forget my lines, or fall over, or both! 
 Really, how depressing. 
 Let's see if we can find some music... 
 (She changes the radio channel) 
 I'm sorry to leave so abruptly, but if I don't collect Matthew now we'll be late for the play... 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 I assumed you would have told Miss Whelan who Adam's mother was. 
 It didn't occur to me. 
 And you didn't tell the police. 
 I was worried that they'd question him, upset him. 
 I have explained this to you. 
 Why don't you want people to know? 
 You're scared for him, aren't you? 
 But not because of his mother. 
 This has nothing to do with who his mother was. 
 This is about his father. 
 Leena, please... 
 This is about who his father is. 
 That night you saw them at Viceregal Lodge, she was taking him to see Ralph Whelan, wasn't she? 
 You shouldn't say such things. 
 It's what you believe. I know it is. 
 What happened? 
 This is what a confession looks like, Mr McLeod. 
 Well? 
 He's still not here. 
 Oh...! 
 He wouldn't, would he? 
 He might. 
 I'll kill him! 
 What are we going to do? 
 Beg Eugene to come back? 
 I'll kill myself! 
 Let's give it five more minutes. 
 Oh...! 
 He's still not here! 
 Do you think I did it? 
 Do you think I killed her? 
 No. 
 But it felt like you were trying to convince me otherwise. 
 You ran, Ramu. 
 You told me they'd find evidence. 
 When they arrest a man like you, they look for evidence. 
 If they can't find it, you walk free. 
 When they arrest a man like me... if they can't find it... they simply invent it. 
 (Gentle jazz music) 
 Aafrin...! People can see. 
 Nobody knows us here. 
 Anyway, they probably all think we're married. 
 So, tonight, we are man and wife? 
 It will be good practice, hm? 
 What do you think? 
 You are aware the character is meant to be 29 years old? 
 What, has he had a hard life in our version? 
 Willingdon's older than me. 
 Yes, but he's the Viceroy of India! 
 I'm the only one who knows the lines, Cynthia, so I'll have to do. 
 I hate Ian McLeod with a bloody vengeance! 
 Oh, come on, crack a smile. 
 It'll be just like old times. 
 Come on, then... 
 Let's get on and do this. 
 That's more like it! 
 And then, let's track down Ian McLeod and break both his legs! 
 Did you hear what I was playing, Lane? 
 I think I'm beginning to understand. 
 I refused to lie down. 
 I dared to stand up to them as their equal. 
 And that... that, Mr McLeod, was my real crime. 
 And I knew that, one day... one day... I would be punished for it. 
 This place is despicable. 
 We are all given a part that we must play. 
 We all have levels that... we cannot move beyond. 
 It's really very simple. 
 Keep your head down. 
 Don't question anything, don't challenge anything. 
 Play your part, Ian. 
 It's the only way to survive. 
 Are your parents living? 
 I have lost both my parents. 
 To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune. 
 To lose both looks like carelessness! 
 Yes? 
 Ah, Mr McLeod. So, you've seen him, then? 
 I did. 
 Good. You can content yourself now, I hope. 
 He looks like he's wearing his face inside out. 
 Oh, yes. Yes. Incident with another prisoner, I believe. 
 Unfortunate. 
 Really? 
 Mr McLeod, I'm in a hurry. Could we... 
 He didn't do it. 
 I understand that this is difficult for you to accept... 
 No, it's fact. He didn't do it. 
 He couldn't have done it. 
 He has an alibi. 
 Don't interfere in this matter, Mr McLeod. 
 You won't be thanked for it. Trust me. 
 I know I won't. 
 But I can't just keep my head down and carry on. I won't. 
 He has an alibi. 
 And I'm it. 
 I hope it did not end happily? 
 I don't like novels that end happily. 
 They depress me so much. 
 The good ended happily and the bad unhappily. 
 That is what fiction means. 
 (Approaching footsteps) 
 I've got some news for you. 
 Ramu Sood, I'm charging you with murder. 
 Bravo! 
 (Cheering) 
 I need to ask you a very important question. 
 Did your mother ever talk to you about your father? 
 Many times. 
 Did she tell you who he is? 
 Yes. 
 What is his name? 
 (Rakshas.) 
 You don't have to send for me, Mr Whelan. 
 I've saved you the trouble. 
 Leave us. 
 It's disappointing, Ian. I can't lie to you. 
 Telling the truth? 
 Giving an innocent man an alibi is disappointing? 
 Because he is innocent, Ralph. 
 Ramu didn't kill that woman. 
 I feel sorry for you. Really, I do. 
 You don't have any idea what you've just done. 
 He didn't do it. 
 I know he didn't. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 How could it possibly not matter? 
 Innocent or not, people won't understand you defending a man like that. 
 It's not done. 
 You're alone now. 
 Adrift. 
 I always was. 
 I've never been one of you, Ralph. 
 Well, you'll find you're certainly not one of them, either. 
 Those doors will open in a moment. 
 I wouldn't let anyone see you here. 
 I'm afraid they won't make you welcome. 
 Not any more. 
 Vinod Mukesh, advocate. 
 I can defend myself. 
 Against a top-notch Britisher? 
 You'll be eaten alive. 
 The prosecution will tear you apart. 
 Is that what you want to be? A failure? 
 An embarrassment to your family? 
 Go home and stay home. 
 Whatever you do, avoid the mission. 
 She brought Adam to Simla to meet his father. 
 Doesn't someone need to know that before this trial is over? 
 Our job is to take care of him. 
 Do you know who the father is? 
 Enough! 
 They were actually starting to like me. 
 Please, don't... 
 Forgive me. 
 Better that I keep quiet, sit back and watch, while an innocent man goes down? 
 Are you lying, Mr McLeod? 
 Do you think Sood did it? 
 Oh, Ralph, don't look so worried. I'm not going anywhere. 
 Maybe that's my fear.
