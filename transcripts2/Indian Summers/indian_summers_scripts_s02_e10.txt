 What have you done to her? 
 Three tickets for The Cathay, tourist class. 
 My wife... and your little Parsi. 
 You know nothing about this man. 
 You know what my husband is like. 
 What exactly did you do to stop him? 
 Have they made an announcement? 
 Our new leader. Yes! 
 Tell me. 
 The Marquis of Linlithgow. 
 These two men, you saw them together? 
 Yes. 
 What am I being charged with here? 
 Oh, he'll hang. 
 What can I do? 
 I want my wife. 
 I can give you what you want. 
 I'll need better proof than that. 
 Come away with me. 
 We need to stop this. 
 You love me. 
 Not in the way you mean. 
 Well, I'll be damned. 
 Nobody get out. 
 Lock the door after me. 
 Are you lost, old fellow? 
 Alice? Alice! 
 Look, we have a long day ahead of us, and I'm not having you frightening my son any more than you already have. 
 So why don't you just pop along? 
 All right, all right, easy does it. 
 Alice! 
 Alice, look at me. 
 Alice? 
 This chap, he wants a word. 
 Alice? 
 No? 
 Nothing? 
 Now do you see? 
 Hmm? 
 You see? 
 Oof! 
 Alice! 
 Alice! 
 Alice! 
 Alice! 
 Sooni... my darling... meri jaan... 
 Yes, what do you want? 
 I have a certain favour to ask, actually. 
 What favour? 
 It is everything or it is nothing, that depends on you. 
 But you do this one thing for me, I will never ask for any such a thing of you again, I swear. 
 That sounds very grave. 
 Shall we go in? 
 Suno! Suno! Sab! Suno! 
 Suno! Suno! Sab! Suno! 
 House on Summer Hill for auction! 
 House on Summer Hill for auction! 
 Suno! Suno! Sab! Suno! 
 House on Summer Hill for auction! 
 Nasty little man. 
 Don't worry. I won't tell. 
 Mr McLeod! 
 Ian... I was told you'd gone mad. 
 I got my heart broke. 
 Does that count? 
 You know there's only one cure for that. 
 Please take your seats, ladies and gentlemen! 
 Please take your seats! 
 Mr Wilson-Hutchinson? Are you in charge? 
 Getting there, Mr Keane, getting there. 
 Good chaps. 
 Mmm! Look at her, all smiles. 
 Wretched woman. 
 You're the one who asked her to stay. 
 For a night or two... in my weakness! 
 I had no idea she was planning to move in! 
 It's end of the season, I've not had a penny out of her! 
 My sherry is miraculously disappearing, and you know what's the worst of it? 
 I don't know, Cynthia. What is the worst of it? 
 She knows damn well I can't chuck her out, especially now she's installed herself in that dress! 
 Also mine! 
 She's in mourning. 
 Oh, rot! 
 I tell you, Ronnie, someone needs to have a word. 
 Because I think the kindest thing would be to send her home... or hand her over to Kaiser, he can give her some washing-up. 
 Well, don't look at me. 
 You are Club Secretary, Ronnie. 
 Oh! 
 Whelan? 
 So sorry about your house. 
 I'm not dead yet, comrade. 
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the sale. 
 There is only one lot... the house and all its contents. 
 So who here would care to open the bidding? 
 Half a crown! I have it here somewhere! 
 Very funny, Mr Keane. 
 Do I hear 10,000 rupees? Anywhere? 
 10,000. 10,000 rupees. Thank you very much the gentleman in the grey. 
 Bloody marvellous! We'll be in touch! 
 Thank you, sir. 
 OK, thank you. 
 The elusive Mr Whelan! 
 20,000 rupees, Mr Abanandu. 
 25! 
 25,000, Mr Keane. 
 30. 
 30,000 rupees, Mr Abanandu, any raise on 30,000 rupees? 
 Now, as you know, I'm having a natter with everyone on behalf of the incoming Viceroy, I expect you know why... 
 Well, if you're anything like me, you'll be sorting the chaff from the grain, in Biblical fashion. 
 And what do you propose I do with you? 
 Fifty! 
 50,000 from Mrs Coffin in the middle. 
 With immediate effect. 
 I'm not in the business of driving good men into the ground. 
 On the contrary, you'd be setting me free. 
 Mr Whelan... Mr Whelan! 
 Any raise on 50,000 rupees? 
 Sixty thousand. 
 What? 
 60,000 rupees. 
 We have a new bidder. 
 It's Ramu Sood's family... the one that got hanged. 
 They're all rich as sin. 
 Seventy. 
 Cynthia... 
 70,000 rupees! 
 Thank you very much, Mrs Coffin. 
 One lakh. 
 One lakh. 
 100,000 rupees. Thank you, Mr Sood. 
 Madam? 
 150. 
 Cynthia! It's hardly worth 50! 
 Don't tell me what to do... 
 150,000 rupees, thank you, Mrs Coffin. 
 Two hundred! 
 200,000 rupees, thank you, sir. 
 Mrs Coffin? 
 I command... I command you to stop... 
 Two... three hundred thousand. 
 300,000 rupees to Mrs Coffin. 
 Four hundred. 
 400,000, that's four lakhs of rupees, from Mr Sood. 
 Do I hear any advance on 400,000? 
 400,000 rupees. 
 Madam? 
 Mrs Coffin, I'm going to have to sell... 
 Going once, going twice... sold to Mr Sood. 
 Sooni, now, I gather there is a young man that wishes to marry you. 
 Yes, correct. 
 We have been discussing it carefully. 
 Really? 
 Thank you, Ma, Daddy. 
 Yes, now, your mother has written to the priest at the Parsi temple... 
 Excuse me, Daddy, but Naseem was hoping to be wed tomorrow, here in Simla. 
 With your kind permission, sir. 
 Please, just one... 
 Naseem? 
 The man I will marry. 
 No, darling, the man you're going to marry is Boman Contractor. 
 Everything is underway. 
 So we will have no more tricks. 
 Daddy? 
 There's no point waving the begging-bowl in your father's direction, he is 100% for this wedding, isn't that right, Daddy? 
 Yes, naturally, yeah. 
 Baapi. 
 Look up, please. 
 Is there somewhere we can go? 
 Yes, yes, let's go and talk, come on. 
 Naseem, come. 
 No, this young man will stay put. 
 Come, come, come. 
 Come. 
 Now, listen to your father. 
 Tradition is a gift... not a burden! 
 And Boman is a fine, patient young fellow! 
 But I wish to work! 
 Oh, is that what all this is about? 
 I am not simply giving up hope! 
 There are women all over India, Ma. Look at Kamala-auntie's two girls! 
 Please, can we go and discuss this at home? 
 I don't care about Kamala-auntie, I care about you! 
 And what about the children when they come, hmm! What will they be? 
 They will be cared for by myself and Naseem, and you too if you are willing! 
 This child has no understanding of the world... 
 Listen to me, what your mother means is what will they be? 
 Because I cannot see how they can possibly be Parsi! 
 Yes! 
 What does it matter what they will be? 
 It matters to us, your family! 
 Naturally, they will be Muslim. 
 Ah! 
 And you? 
 Sooni? 
 I, too. 
 Ah? 
 How and when will this miracle conversion take place? 
 It has. 
 What? 
 What did she say? 
 Sometimes I can't understand what she's saying... 
 I said it already has. 
 I made a simple declaration, in front of the imam, not one hour ago. 
 It was just a few words. 
 It doesn't mean anything. 
 There they are! 
 Ma. 
 Aafrin! 
 Aafrin, what happened? 
 I had a fall. Now, what's all this I'm hearing? 
 Sooni? 
 Don't call her that. 
 That's not her name. 
 What? 
 Your sister is a Muslim now, it seems! 
 Tell me, tell me, what should we call you now? 
 Sooni! 
 You call me Sooni! 
 And you will all please come to my wedding tomorrow. 
 She's joking with us! 
 Oh, Jaanu, please... 
 That is not her name for sure. 
 What is your name, child? 
 Sooni. 
 Your name. 
 Laila! 
 It is Laila! 
 It is just for the ceremony and nothing else! 
 Laila. 
 Laila? 
 No, I don't think I know any such person, do you, Daddy? 
 No, I'm afraid I don't. 
 Aafrin? 
 This is his fault! 
 See? 
 He does what he likes, he takes and takes and every time there is less for me! 
 You leave your poor brother be! 
 Ask him! 
 Ask him about the English woman! 
 She is married! 
 Stop it, Sooni. 
 Oh, please stop it. 
 She is married with a child and everybody knows except you, Ma! 
 I didn't know. 
 Shut up, miss goody-two-shoes! 
 Please, come on now, we can discuss all this calmly in the house... 
 I'm sorry, but I'm sick of it! 
 I'm sick of people lying and pretending to cover your eyes! 
 No-one is covering my eyes. 
 No-one. 
 He is a good boy. 
 He is a good, good, hard-working boy, and that is all there is, that is all there is... Aafrin? 
 It's of no importance. 
 The woman is gone. 
 And I am very late for an appointment! 
 Aafrin? 
 Dalal? 
 Now, the old Viceroy has done fine work out here, but there's work to be done, a new man at the helm, raft of bold reforms thanks to our Government's India Bill, elections to come. 
 To move forward hand in hand with India towards the ultimate goal of self-government, though not before she's ready and I feel, what we all do, that there's every reason to be optimistic. 
 Do sit down. 
 Have you heard of Tathguni, sir? 
 No. I can't say I have... 
 Oh, it's a place of no importance. 
 A village in the plains, on the road down from Kalka. 
 Earlier this morning, in Tathguni, a Hindu boy died. 
 He discovered some explosives, buried in the ground, and unwittingly he caused them to blow up in his face, and since these explosives were buried on land belonging to a Muslim fellow, now there is trouble between both sides. 
 But the truth is nobody knows who buried the explosives, or for what purpose. 
 Well, we'll get on to it right away. 
 Thank you, sir, and may I say you seem like a sound fellow? 
 Thank you. 
 But I have met your type before... 
 I have heard your speeches... your speech, since it is always the same, and I have to say, I do not share your optimism, because the truth is... the truth is nobody here wants your rotten Bill, sir. 
 We don't want it, and we don't trust it! 
 It is a machine composed entirely of brakes, sir, and though all sides, even the native Princes, are agreed that they hate this Bill, sir, the truth is all it will do, sir, all it will ever do, is drive us deeper apart, Hindu against Muslim, until every city, every field is sewn with bombs and knives, and only the word of Gandhi stands between us, and you, sir. 
 Not rulers, but policemen, since that is all you are, keeping the peace with your lathis raised until the whistle is blown and you run your last damn furlong into the sea. 
 Mujhe jane dijiye. 
 The wheel says a prayer for us, inside, even if we don't say a word. 
 Quick! Before she gets away! 
 What do I say? 
 Remind her of our rates. It's all written down there. 
 Good boy. 
 Now, gentlemen... If you'd like to follow me. 
 
 
 
 Oh... I say, Mrs Raworth! 
 Oh, no. 
 What does he want? 
 Are you sure you want to stay on here in India? 
 You know I do. 
 Right. Leave it to me. 
 Mr Keane! 
 I know one shouldn't mention it, but black rather suits your mother. 
 If you say so. 
 Thank you! 
 Go on. Hop it, you. 
 Now, look, Cynthia asked me to inquire, what are your plans, going forward? 
 Now, the truth is, Mr Keane... 
 Ronnie, crumbs! 
 Ronnie, the truth is I have a sister in Broadstairs, she does have a room spare up in the loft, now that her eldest has got a place of his own, it would be a bit of a squeeze, but... 
 I mean, I could take in some needlework, couldn't I? 
 I'm not afraid of hard work, Ronnie, it would just be an adjustment, that's all. 
 I'm sure it won't come to that. 
 Why ever not? 
 But you have so many other qualities. 
 I don't feel as though I have any. 
 Nonsense. 
 You're a fine woman. 
 A fine-looking woman. 
 What have you got there? 
 Work. 
 Work! 
 It's just a form I forgot to sign. 
 Poor Ronnie, never off-duty. 
 Hmm... 
 I say, shall we ring for some more tea? 
 Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. 
 Don't move. 
 There we are, there we are. There we are! 
 Eyes closed, eyes closed, there we go. 
 There we are, there we are. 
 Everyone! 
 I just want to introduce our newest members to the fray... 
 So please, be sure to welcome the Sood family. 
 Yeah, er, hang on... just one more thing, if you'll indulge me! 
 Next spring, as ever, I will be here to welcome you home of course... 
 No change there! 
 No, that's right! 
 But from now on these gentlemen will be undertaking the ownership charge of the Club itself. 
 Cynth? What are you talking about? 
 Well, I will be keeping my place on the board, so you'll hardly notice any difference! 
 All right? 
 Oh, God! 
 Give a man a simple job! 
 Percy's sound asleep. 
 Good. 
 I wonder... say by Christmas time, what will India be, in his head, do you think? 
 Dear old Ayah, yes. And that jolly wooden horse. 
 And then, Christmas after that? It'll just be a bed-time story. 
 Then one day, he'll wake up and say to himself, "Were we ever really here at all? 
 "Or are they just pulling my leg?" 
 Wake up. 
 Aafrin? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Do you remember Tathguni? 
 What? 
 The village in the plains, Tathguni. 
 Yes, what about it? 
 Yesterday a Hindu boy was killed there, last night his Muslim landlord's house was reportedly burned to the ground, the entire family died in the fire, and now... look at this. 
 The two sides are tearing each other apart. 
 This morning when I telephoned the police headquarters, the line was cut. 
 Why are you getting involved in all this? 
 Think! 
 You pass right through it on the road to Delhi! 
 Alice? 
 She must be halfway to Bombay by now... 
 Sahib? 
 The driver was instructed to stop in the dak bungalow above Kalka for one night, before heading to the plains. 
 Are you sure? 
 There is no doubt, sahib. 
 Adam! 
 Get up! Get up! 
 Where are you going, sahib? 
 To borrow the state governor's car. 
 How long is Lord Willingdon planning to stay in India? 
 Handover's not till the spring. 
 There will be no end of fawning dinners of course, but I shan't be bothering with them. 
 Why not? 
 We had a parting of the ways. 
 His Excellency discovered the truth about Ramu Sood. 
 He gave me one or two home truths. 
 It's better, actually. You see things more clearly when you've less to hide. 
 Though I was... I was sorry to lose the house. 
 Come on, old girl! 
 Now, we have to get a move on, so Driver can deposit us in Delhi to be back in time for his grand-daughter's birthday, isn't that right, old boot? 
 You know, I never planned to fall in love with your sister. 
 Yes, I know that. 
 Look at the suffering I've caused to so many people, my family, Alice. 
 You. 
 Sounds wretched. 
 Yes. 
 I am a poor wretch! 
 A poor, sad fool! 
 And why? 
 There is so much joy in this world... and it is only a little out of reach. 
 Are you sure you're feeling all right? 
 Better, my friend. 
 Much better, thank you. 
 Horse feathers! 
 What is it, Daddy? 
 Nothing for you to worry about back there. 
 Can't we just hoof it off the path? 
 He says we have to wait for some people from the village. 
 Village? 
 Tathguni, sir. 
 No, no. Drive on. 
 Go on, man, drive around it! You can do it. 
 There! See? 
 No harm done! 
 Clumsy! Whatever is it now? 
 Ek minit, sahib. 
 Where's he going, Daddy? 
 Now, he just has to talk to some chaps in the village, and before you know it, we'll have a pair of brand-spanking new tyres. 
 What's that? 
 What's what? 
 Look. 
 Hang on. 
 Shall we get out? 
 No, no, no. You wait in here. 
 Windows closed, I think. 
 My trusty sword and shield! 
 How about this? 
 Just close this window as well. 
 Where's Daddy going? 
 Daddy! 
 He won't be long. 
 Wait. Wait! 
 You wait when I tell you to! 
 Yes. Yes! That's more like it! That is better. 
 Just sit there for a minute, will you? 
 You do as you're told, yes! 
 Very good. 
 It's all right. 
 It's all right! 
 Mummy? 
 Lie down! 
 Mummy! 
 Alice! 
 Mummy, I'm scared, Mummy! 
 Alice! 
 Alice! Open the door! Open the door! 
 Open the damn door! 
 Open the damn door! Alice! 
 Stay here. 
 If they see an Englishman here, they will rip you apart! 
 Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross To see a fine lady upon a white horse... 
 Wait! 
 You kill me first! 
 You kill me first! 
 Aafrin? 
 Aafrin! 
 It's all right, I'm here. 
 An Kah'tu nafsaka a'lal... 
 Mah'ril... 
 Mah'ril ma'loom. 
 Qabiltun Nikaha. 
 Jaanu? 
 You remember my old coat? 
 Those were the days, when we were happy and poor. 
 Oh! 
 Look what I found in the pocket! See? 
 What is it? 
 Some rice and old rose petals. 
 See? 
 Feel it. 
 It must be confetti from your uncle Homi's wedding? 
 No. That was before. 
 The suit came much later. 
 Oh. 
 Then your cousin Mehroo? 
 Yes, must be that. 
 Who knows? 
 Jaanu... 
 Hmm? 
 It's almost two o'clock. 
 Then it's done. 
 But... we might look in at the festivities...? 
 Huh? 
 Jaanu? 
 You wish to go? 
 You wish to go and see this? 
 Huh? 
 Well... I can't lose her. 
 What do you say? 
 Shall we think again? 
 I don't know who she is, Daddy. 
 No. 
 She is someone else's child now. 
 But I still have one daughter. 
 I did it. 
 Sssh. 
 I did it. 
 I killed him. 
 No. 
 Death took him, but you he gave back to me. 
 Come. 
 Where are we going? 
 You too, Percy. 
 Oh, look! 
 So? 
 Are we welcome? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, you are very welcome. 
 You too, Mrs... 
 Alice. 
 Alice, yes. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't thank me! 
 I'm hardly going to miss my own sister's wedding. 
 No! 
 But you are all very late and the food is getting cold. 
 Please, come, please, eat. 
 Ashem vohu vahishtem asti ushta asti ushta ahmai hyat ashai vahishtai ashem... 
 So I worked it out, you're owed almost three months' leave, did you know that? 
 Three months! 
 I thought we could go on a trip. 
 Oh, yes? 
 I could take you to Chicago. 
 We could start over, if you like? 
 I can't just leave. 
 This is my home. 
 You lost it, remember? 
 It belongs to someone else now. 
 Oh! There you are! 
 I rather fancied I'd find you surrounded by trunks and God knows what! 
 But then I suppose that's the beauty of selling the house furnished, isn't it? 
 Cuts down on all the packing. 
 It sure does that. 
 Would you excuse me a minute? 
 Yes, Bhupinder, would you get that thing off the wall? 
 It's Great-uncle Toby, memsahib. 
 Yes, the very same. 
 Jolly good. Now bring him out here, would you? 
 As you wish. 
 Ooh, I do wish! 
 Ardently, as it happens. 
 Now, put him down there, would you, poor chap. 
 There we are. 
 Aargh! 
 Cynthia! 
 That's better! 
 Is he dead yet? 
 Who's next? Young man? 
 Cynthia! 
 There you go. 
 In it goes! 
 Thrust and parry! 
 What the hell are you playing at? 
 You know it's not often you get to bask in a look of genuine astonishment on your husband's face, is it? 
 Now, who else? Ayah? 
 No, thank you, memsahib. 
 Oh, what a pity! 
 You see, I thought since I now do in fact own this sorry little house, I might be permitted to make one or two very small adjustments. 
 Where are those old trinkets of your great-great-aunt Nervosa, is it...? 
 Jocelyn, her name was Jocelyn! 
 What's she...? Cynthia! 
 Listen to him, the man in charge! 
 Now, Bhupinder, I'm going to need a hand with all this. 
 Yes, memsahib. 
 Three bags full, memsahib. 
 I'm sorry, but I refuse to live in some Whelan family mausoleum! 
 We will cast these devils out! 
 Those date back to George II. 
 Not any more they don't, they've had a good innings. 
 Hang on, "live", she said "live". 
 Well, it's quite simple really... Ayah, that is an order! 
 Oh, give me strength! 
 Boy! Show her! 
 That's it! 
 Yes, I came to an arrangement with the tribe of Sood. 
 They take the Club, I get Chotipool. 
 You can't possibly do that. 
 Oh, it's quite straightforward. We just swapped the deeds around. 
 But it's your Club... 
 Oh, yeah, well, I'll still be running it. 
 They wouldn't last two ticks, would they, without my guiding hand! 
 I think the penny's finally dropped in that regard... 
 How could you go ahead without consulting me? 
 Well, I'm sorry, your Honour. 
 You need a house. I need a home. 
 You're moving in? 
 Well, yes! 
 You will hardly know I'm here. 
 Oh, Ralphie, you don't mind, do you? 
 Because there is nothing in the world more important to me than your happiness. 
 And I am afraid you are stuck with me now! 
 Here. 
 Give it to me. 
 That's the ticket! 
 Now, when we're finished with this lot, we're going to move on to the glassware! Bhupinder! 
 Have you got such a thing as a wheelbarrow? 
 What's wrong with us, do you think? 
 Why are we doing this to ourselves? 
 Who knows? 
 Too obstinate, in your case. 
 In my case, I'm simply too honest. 
 Yes, honest to a fault. 
 Anyway, others will simply have to adapt, won't they? 
 We are the pioneers. 
 Wherever we lead, the world will follow! 
 I hope so. 
 Come on... let's dance. 
 Naseem? 
 I'm sorry, chacha, but it's our wedding, and my bride wishes to dance! 
 Look. 
 What is it? 
 Winter.
