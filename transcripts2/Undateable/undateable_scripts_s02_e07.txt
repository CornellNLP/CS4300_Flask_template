 Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 Thank you very much, ah, it's an absolute pleasure to be here... um, I've got... I've got a couple more songs. 
 This next song is about a... 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm sorry. I'm sorry there, my red-headed friend... um... 
 See this open mic is a one-song max so... 
 I was told... 
 No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. 
 James... I'm just gonna unplug your tiny guitar. 
 There you go, just watch your step. It's okay. 
 Hey, listen, you have potential. You have. 
 Okay, all right. I just wouldn't quit your day job yet. 
 Out of curiosity what is your day job? 
 I sing. 
 Really? 
 'Cause see I'm a cool college professor all the students invite to their party, ah... 
 Ah, we both said our dreams out loud. 
 Does he have a sister? 
 That'll teach you how to butter your crumpet. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 Why did you kick out Ed Sheeran? 
 That was him? 
 Yeah! Of course it was Ed Sheeran! Why do you think Candace is in shock? 
 This is Ed Sheeran's napkin. 
 Oh, even his napkin is soulful and comforting. 
 And like him, very, very, white. 
 Guys, he's probably in town for the Spirit of Detroit Music Festival Yep and he's just tweeted this to his 13 million followers. 
 "If you see this raw rude bar owner, give him a smack from me" 
 Sorry. 
 I'm an Ed-head. I do what I'm told. 
 Hey. Is this mic still open? 
 Well, yeah, man. Just play something to cheer me up, make me feel like a winner. 
 A winner? He's a guitarist, not a wizard. 
 Yeah. I'm Waz. I write music for TV shows. 
 I just something for "CSI Cyber." 
 Oh yeah, that's right, ah... 
 CSI: Cyber, that's that new CSI show that's all about technology. 
 This computer didn't die. This computer was murdered. 
 The last one to see him alive was this cell phone Talk! Talk! 
 You'd better talk or I'll put you in the toilet! 
 Hey, Waz. You know what? 
 I got an idea. Ah, why don't you riff a TV show theme song and then we'll all do cheesy opening credit faces. 
 You guys in? 
 ♪ 
 Oh, man. Justin's still upset about his ex getting married. It's so boring. 
 Oh, give him a break. Nikki was the first girl he ever loved and she's marrying a guy this weekend who's way more successful than him. 
 Sorry. 
 I'm fine. I know she's your friend. 
 You can all go to the wedding. 
 Oh, I'm not going. 
 Until Saturday. 
 Anyway uh, to make him, to make him feel better, we all stayed at home last night and watched "Scandal." 
 Oh, are you a huge fan of that show? 
 A fan? Let's say I'm a fan of oxygen I need "Scandal" 
 Unfortunately, the whole time Justin was trying to convince me that Scott Foley was better looking than me. 
 How did that come up? 
 Well, the episode ended, and then I said I'm so much better looking than Scott Foley, let's discuss this." 
 Actually, coincidentally, Scott Foley visited my dreams last night. 
 Oh, spicy! Think he'll be back tonight? 
 No, no. He's exhausted. 
 Face it, Danny. Scott Foley's a genetic masterpiece I never seen eyes dazzle like his. 
 And that's from a guy with blue eyes that can touch the sky. 
 Yeah, my eyes could touch the sky. 
 Wow... 
 Probably wouldn't know anything about eyes like that, not with those brown mud buckets. 
 Like I told you the day you moved in, these are tootsie rolls. 
 End of conversation. 
 No! Ugh! 
 You know, I have like an hour to kill and that was the most insane eavesdropping ever. 
 Well, I guess we could continue arguing near the pretty lady. 
 You know what, I'm just, I'm sick of getting judged by my appearance from some guy who looks like Greg Kinnear in middle school. 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Yeah, well you look like Hugh Jackman's tired, older brother. 
 Oh, yeah? Well, you put on a lot of weight since we started shooting. 
 Thanks for saying that. 
 I want in. Who do I look like? 
 Hey, when did Jeff Goldblum and David Schwimmer have a baby? 
 Good burn, new girl. 
 Hey, ah, I have to make a quick phone call but will you two be here when I get back? 
 Yeah, yeah, I own this bar, Yep, I'll be around. 
 So I'm always here. 
 I'm just gonna hang out. 
 Yep, cool. 
 Cool. 
 (Both:) Ha-ha-ha. I saw her first! 
 No, you didn't! 
 Yes, I did! 
 (Both:) Get out of my head! I'm not in your head! You're in my head! 
 No I'm not. Yes, I am. How are we doing this? 
 It's easy, we practice at home! I'm gonna trick you by stopping in the middle of a sentence. Panda! 
 Panda! Panda! What?

 I brought my keyboard in. 
 Yeah, but what did we do to you? 
 A dollar. 
 People in Detroit are terrible tippers. 
 Mmm... sweetie, it might not be Detroit. 
 You can be a little bit snarky. 
 Oh, he doesn't know that word. 
 Snarky is American for smart-mouth bitch. 
 He was a bitch to us, too, Shell. 
 Why you hating on my friends, man? 
 These guys just work with me at the retirement home. 
 They just trying to destress. 
 Destress from what? 
 What kind of trouble can kindly old grandparents get into? 
 Everyone is banging everyone. When you walk in on two old people having s*x in the rec room, it-it's like when you make eye contact with a dog that's pooping They just kind of stare at you while they finish their business. 
 Sometimes they ask us to join in. 
 Urgh, that's disgusting. 
 Do you ever do it? 
 No! 
 What? That is so gross. 
 How dare you! How dare... 
 There have been seven times. 
 I get lonely. 
 Well, we brought some of them out. 
 Yeah. 
 See Mrs. Bosma? Yeah, she'll get freaky with anybody. 
 Male, female. She don't care. 
 Mrs. Bosma, what's that thing you always say? 
 Ass is ass. 
 That's true, it's a good saying. 
 See Brett, you know you'd get more tips if you were nicer. 
 Oh, shut up. Like you can do any better. 
 Want me to get behind that bar and we'll see? And whoever gets the most tips at the end of the night is the winner. 
 Hm, I dunno Shel. What was the name of the greatest cheerleader movie ever made? 
 Oh, yeah, that's it... Bring It On! 
 No matter how this ends, we're watching that movie later. 
 Okay. Kiss his ass, Shel. Okay? 
 Hey! That's for Ed. 
 That tattooed ginger has got me through some tough times. 
 So, ah, you from here? 
 No. I'm just in town for the music festival.

 I can do this alone. 
 Yeah, you never know. Could turn into a threesome. 
 Oh, they don't mean you, Miss Bosma. 
 Sit your ass back. 
 Bae, you don't have a full-length mirror in here? 
 No. 
 Then where do you flex? 
 Candace, you up? 
 Wait. My friends can't know that you slept here. They hate you. 
 Yeah, what's up with that? I'm Trent, end of story. 
 You know what, Trent? Maybe it is because we dated, you treated me badly and you took advantage of me until I had no self-esteem left. 
 Oh, right, right. 
 We cool? 
 Dog: Woof The mo says no. 
 Oh, Trent. Candace what is this jackass doing here? 
 Here's your shirt back, bae. 
 Okay, I get it. 
 Yeah. Everyone. 
 Everyone gets it. 
 It got late, he just came over late and needed a place to cash. Nothing happened. 
 I tried, but my game was just too weak! 
 Hey, Candace, I thought I taught you how to deal with tough situations like this. Leslie, I'm too small to drink three bottles of wine and then go to sleep. 
 It's okay, I can be strong for you. 
 Trent, get the hell out of here. Slower. 
 Wait! Okay, I'm done. 
 What's up with that guy?

 So, can I get you two lovely ladies a drink? 
 No, piss off, we want the black Winnie the Pooh. 
 Oohh! Hello, ladies. 
 Hello. 
 Let's make a bet. If you can guess my name, we have to take you home and have sexy time with you all night long And what if I cannot guess your name? 
 It's Allie. 
 Then I'm gonna guess Allie. 
 Now look, I'm going to tip you, but I want to tuck it in your knickers. 
 And I am okay with that. 
 There we are. Yep. 
 I wrote, I wrote our number on there. 
 Don't smudge it. 
 Hee hee! 
 For Ed. 
 That's for England! 
 I have to head out for rehearsal. 
 I'll come back tonight and hang. 
 You know I've had a rough couple of days, so I just want to let you know it's nice to meet someone who could put a smile on my face. 
 Oh, thanks. Nice meeting you guys. 
 Hey, the pleasure was all mine, okay? 
 Well not all his. I was pleasured, too. 
 ♪ 
 I mean I'm not proud that I've been hanging out with Trent. 
 I know he's not going any places. 
 And yes, sure, he can't technically read. 
 But, it's all just so embarrassing. 
 Oh, sweetie, you're just backsliding. We've all done it with an ex. 
 Hell, before I met my ex I was still looking up with my ex-husband. 
 Yeah. And I mean before I met Leslie, I was still hooking up with this... 
 Nobody cares. 
 I guess right now, it's just really tempting to back slide with Trent. 
 Does that go away? 
 Yes. 
 The minute you meet someone that makes you forget him. 
 Well, I back slid with Amy. She was my first love, and the one that got away. I mean literally. 
 She robbed a bank and they could not catch her. 
 So uh, I was thinking about it. 
 Uh, you know what, I think you should ask Amanda out I'm going to, I'm going to bow out. 
 But you like her, too. I mean, I can tell, your eyebrow goes up every time I mention her name. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 Amanda. 
 That eyebrow is about something else. 
 Amanda. 
 Amanda. 
 Amanda. Amanda. 
 Amanda. Amanda. 
 Amanda. Amanda. 
 Amanda. 
 Okay, look. 
 Just let me bow out so that you have a better chance with her. Okay? 
 Wait. Are, are you saying that there's a world that both of us go for her that I don't even stand a chance? 
 Yeah, I do think that there's a world like that. It's, it's this world. 
 It's... it's the world. 
 Amanda and I have everything in common. We're both singers. 
 We're both sensitive souls. Both have a hard time with dairy It's like we were created for each other. 
 Careful, Justin. 
 You always idealize women that you just met. 
 I can't idealize someone who's perfect in every single way. 
 Look, let me just bow out for you okay? 
 Why don't you take yes for an answer? 
 I didn't get to be a 20-year-old virgin by taking yes for an answer. 
 You don't stand a chance with Amanda. 
 For God's sake, she's 22 and you're 130. 
 Face it, you're just scared because even if you try as hard as you can, she'll still pick me. 
 Oh yeah? 
 You want to bet, nerd? 
 You're on. What are the stakes? 
 Loser has to shave his head? 
 No, well, that would punish everyone Why would we want to subject everyone to see your Voldemort skull? 
 I want your dignity. I want your chest hair. 
 Fine. If she goes with me you have to shave your chest. 
 And if she goes with anybody else, I'll shave mine. 
 Nah mm-mm, not shave. Uh-uh, I want to wax it. 
 Right here in this bar. Live. In front of everyone. 
 It's on then. It is on. 
 In fact, I'm going to live tweet that it's on.

 Fine. 
 Wow. 
 I got bored in the middle of a one-word answer. 
 Watch this. Shelly, how's your day going? 
 Oh, the day was like any other. 
 Woke up, smoked some weed. Fed the cat. 
 Freaked out because I didn't own a cat.

 When two silverback gorillas compete for the same female, one will get right in the other's face to show dominance. (gorilla noises) 
 How long does that last? 
 Well, dominant gorilla stays until he realizes that the other gorilla is unimpressive and weak Hey, I'm not weak, Danny. 
 I just don't have any good pick-up lines. 
 You don't need pick-up lines. They're cheesy. Just, talk to me, tell me what you really like it to do. 
 I don't know. I guess, you know, we could open a bottle of wine? 
 Uh, watch a movie? 
 Cook dinner together. I bet you'd look really cute in my apron. Heh. 
 And yes, I own an apron. 
 I love that you own an apron. 
 Uh, what are we making for dessert? 
 You guessed right. That's good conversation. 
 Ohhhh! Yummmm! 
 I just, I just want someone to be myself with. 
 You know? And if I had to choose between going to some big crazy party or staying home and watching movies and eating pizza with you, I'd choose you every time. 
 I've been waiting for somebody to say that to me. 
 I've been waiting for someone to hear it. 
 Thanks for pretending, Candace.
