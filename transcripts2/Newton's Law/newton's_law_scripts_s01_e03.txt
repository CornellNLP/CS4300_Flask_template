 Eyewitness alleges defendant pushed the witness from a rooftop located at... 
 This rooftop? 
 You must find Craig Allen not guilty. 
 (CORK POPS) 
 Oh! 
 Great job today. 
 You haven't seen anything yet. 
 Did Mr Whitley tell you? 
 We'll be sharing chambers when I get back from Noosa. 
 My name is Skye Stewart. 
 I'm with United Trustees Insurance. 
 197,000? 
 Oh, that's bullshit. 
 Looks like more than a few dents. 
 Just doing my job. 
 My company told me you would cooperate fully. 
 If that isn't the case, let me know now and I can make some phone calls. 
 I have a great deal of photographic information. 
 Let's say I raised this information with my boss and was asked to ignore it... 
 I like that girl. She has a lot of integrity. 
 (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) 
 Do you want control of your body? 
 Your health? 
 Your general well-being? 
 Then Total Control Fitness is the place for you. 
 Before I came to Total Control, I was out of control. 
 But with an individually tailored fitness program... nutritional advice... and endless encouragement, I'm now 42 kilos lighter and 100% happier. 
 (ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND ON TV) 
 So, if you want to change your life, join Total Control Fitness... 
 All : And take control today!

 Lewis : Mrs Devries? 
 I don't want to talk about that day again. 
 We understand that suddenly changing counsel can't be easy for you, Lana, but your trial starts soon and it's vital that we clarify a few final points. 
 We just want to get the best result for you possible, but we can't do that without your help. 
 So, please, don't give up now, okay? 
 So, going back to the afternoon before the death took place, you said that you went to the gym to talk to Dylan Norris about breaking your contract as the Total Control Success Story. 
 Fitness studio. 
 Pardon? 
 Madison always called it a fitness studio. 
 Said it sounded much better. 
 And it does. 
 Right. 
 But the thing is, you said that you wanted to break your contract with Dylan because he was exploiting you. 
 How? 
 He just wanted to own me, and I didn't want to be owned. 
 I wanted to do what I wanted to do. 
 What was that? 
 Whatever I wanted. 
 So, when Dylan Norris said that you couldn't get out of the contract, it was binding, you had a full-on meltdown that resulted in you ramming your vehicle into the back of his vehicle several times in the fitness studio car park. 
 Poor Andy. 
 By the time I got home, I was so freaked out. 
 He couldn't calm me down. I couldn't eat. 
 I didn't know what to do, so I just went upstairs to run a bath. 
 But then I crashed out on the bed. 
 Still fully clothed? 
 And from that moment until the next morning when you woke up, you can't remember a thing? 
 The jury's never going to believe she can't remember. 
 Not when the murder weapon's from her personal set of weights. 
 And covered in her prints. 
 We've still got the husband's statement that she never left the house. 
 Let's just hope he's credible. 
 You know, all this case has done is confirm what I've always suspected. 
 Hey. 
 That gyms are dangerous places. 
 All that loud music and clanging metal and sweaty bodies on the verge of heart attacks. 
 I don't think of gyms like that. 
 That's 'cause you never go to one. 
 You never do any exercise at all. 
 You drink like a fish and you party until dawn and you're disgustingly healthy. 
 Very annoying. 
 You're wrong. 
 You took me to a gym once... after drinking like a fish and partying till dawn. 
 It's over 10 years ago, but I remember. 
 National Mooting Comp, Canberra. 
 Mm. Yeah, I was right the first time. Gyms are dangerous places. 
 Oh, morning! 
 Craig. 
 First day? 
 Need a help moving your things? 
 No, thanks. This is it. 
 The gallery's dropping the desk later. 
 Don't worry, I'm a tight unit. Minimalist. 
 You'll hardly notice me. 
 Excuse me. 
 Heard you inherited that gym case. 
 If you find yourself stretched... 
 Oh, we'll let you know, Craig. 
 Here we are. 
 Morning. 
 Hang on. 
 Ah, they're right here somewhere. 
 While we're sharing chambers, maybe I should get another key. 
 That's one option. 
 Getting warmer. 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 Yep. 
 Just tell me when your desk comes and I'll rearrange things. 
 Ah, you've tidied up. 
 Cool chair. 
 Oh, thanks. It's Lewis's. 
 We'll leave you to settle in. 
 Mm. 
 Have you checked them for ladders? 
 You don't think we should throw the puppy a bone? 
 He was accused of murder! 
 But you got him off. 
 He can dig up his own bones. 
 Your room? 
 Definitely. 
 We've got our interview with Lana's husband. 
 Lewis Hughes. 
 Thanks for coming in at such short notice, Mr Devries. 
 We really appreciate it. 
 Oh, just tell me how I can help her. 
 Right this way. 
 The dynamic duo. 
 Why are you still wearing them? 
 What? 
 I told you last week, they needed resoling. 
 Oh, give them to me. I'll get them done. 
 I didn't mean now! 
 Why not? I don't have court. 
 You can't roam around here in your socks. It's undignified. 
 Well, I'll... I'll wear those slippers I bought in Istanbul. 
 Been collecting dust for years. 
 For a very good reason. 
 Craig! 
 (CLEARS THROAT) Sorry. 
 How was your call from our favourite clerk? 
 Mm, good, good. 
 Nothing in concrete yet, but he's working on it. 
 Got a few calls to make. 
 Poor lad. 
 No one in their right minds would give him a brief. 
 Well, let him junior on one of yours. He is your godson. 
 But not by choice. 
 She was a complete mess. 
 She didn't want to eat or watch TV, so she went upstairs for a bath. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Lame duck hotline. 
 Oh. I'm so sorry. 
 So you stayed downstairs. What then? 
 Not much. 
 Um, I ate dinner, had a glass of wine, watched TV. 
 Then when I finally went to bed, she was lying on top of the covers. 
 And in your statement, you said this was around 11 o'clock. 
 Is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'd been watching Lateline. I went to bed when it finished. 
 The thing is, Mr Devries, is the prosecution is going to argue that it's entirely possible that while you were downstairs your wife left the house, killed Mr Norris and then returned without you knowing. 
 That's crazy. 
 Is it, though? 
 The TV was on, you'd had a few wines, probably nodded off. 
 Well, maybe I... 
 Yeah, maybe I fell asleep for a minute. 
 Okay. 
 But it wouldn't have been long, and I would've heard the car driving out. 
 I just wish I could've seen this coming. 
 I don't mean that. Lana wouldn't hurt anyone. 
 I should've got her to a doctor and made sure she got help long before things got that bad. 
 What do we know about Lana's mental health? 
 Issues with depression a few years ago. 
 Was she on anti-depressants? 
 Yes, and she's on them again. 
 But that's par for the course in remand. 
 Oh, I hope she survives the trial all right. 
 I'm more worried about the husband. 
 Once he's in the box, the prosecution will accuse him of saying anything to protect the wife. 
 Mm. What about the widow? 
 Madison Norris. 
 Mm, I mean I know she found the body and she called the police, but where was she before that? 
 At home with the kids. 
 Who were three and five at the time, so when the murder took place, the only people who can vouch for her whereabouts are two sleeping children. 
 The police grilled her. She doesn't have a motive. 
 Business was booming. Happy marriage. 
 Still, the second witness up, I wouldn't mind meeting her. 
 You don't have to come. 
 No, no. I love a little excursion, especially if we're going to the gym. 
 Why is this happening? 
 I thought you put in a new thingy. 
 Oh, it's cheaper to refill the old one. 
 You said to cut costs. 
 Yeah, this looks like a censored document from ASIO. 
 You know, if you took on more cases, serious ones where you get paid properly to go to court, this wouldn't be an issue. 
 There is nothing wrong with wills and conveyancing. 
 Selling a house and dying are very stressful events, and if I can make that easier for anyone... 
 We need more money. 
 There's no more old clients. We've sorted them all out. 
 Well, there's the insurance payout from the fire. 
 That should come through any day now. 
 You know what those scumbags are like. 
 It'll take another Molotov cocktail before they shell out. 
 There's the damages case between the landlord and Josephine's sister. 
 Yeah, where was she last spotted? Sunning herself on a beach in Bali? 
 Why do you have to be so difficult? 
 I thought we were going to get a counter lunch at the pub. 
 Get out of the car or I'll take you to a sushi place. 
 Ms Stewart! 
 How lovely to see you again. 
 My dad needs a lawyer. 
 No, I don't! 
 He has to go to court. 
 Great! 
 For us. 
 (BEEPS HORN) 
 Lunch! 
 Mr Stewart, if you are in desperate need of sustenance, I have some leftover lamb I'd be happy to share. 
 Curry doesn't agree with me. 
 The dish is barbecued. 
 It's from last week's Mediterranean Culinary Adventure. 
 Oh, yeah, I know the show. The w*nk*r with the ponytail. 
 But a magician with lamb. 
 All he did was plant a rose bush, but there are rules. 
 They have a landscape gardener in his retirement villa, so Dad gets all these warnings from the manager, does nothing. 
 So, the manager turns up, tries to dig it out himself. 
 Now he reckons that I assaulted him. 
 I didn't touch the slimebag, I just merely disarmed him. 
 He yanked the spade off the manager and he falls backwards and breaks his arm. 
 Oh, no! 
 For heaven's sake, throw it out and go and buy a new one. 
 And while you're there, get this copied in triplicate. 
 Do you know what that office shop charges? 
 I don't care! 
 Make sure you lock this one down. 
 Just go! 
 Put it down! 
 I am so sorry about that. 
 You were saying. 
 The main problem is, if Dad gets convicted of assault, he'll have a record, and if he has a record, the rules say he can be evicted. 
 Though, personally, I don't know why he wanted to live all alone in the first place. 
 I like it there! It's peaceful. 
 There's no way I'm going back to live with that mob of ratbags. 
 I married your mother, not her family. 
 Unless you want me to come live with you. 
 He really needs to win. 
 Mr Stewart, did anyone witness the incident? 
 Oh, the old Russian bird from across the street. 
 She reckons she saw the whole thing. 
 And has she made a statement? 
 No, but she promised me she would. 
 In that case, we could easily resolve this without even stepping foot inside a court room, which is always my preference. 
 No. 
 I know you may still end up with a small fine, but you would definitely save in legal fees. 
 No way. There's a right and there's a wrong. 
 I'm right and he's wrong. 
 There are ways to make our point, and if you feel that this is a matter of prejudice... 
 I don't feel it, I know it. 
 He's got it in for me because... 
 I'm an ex-cop. 
 Oh! 
 Dad once arrested the manager for careless driving. 
 Yeah. Nearly hit a kid on the crossing. 
 And this namby-pamby negotiation stuff is the reason why he got off. 
 Mmm... 
 (SIGHS) 
 If I'm going to hire you, we're going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. 
 Thrash it out in a court of law. 
 Yes! 
 (BEEPING) 
 Yes! 
 Who... who are you? 
 Uh, Jonathan Allbright. I'm attached to Josephine Newton. 
 Oh. 
 Well, if Miss Newton had an intern, I should've been informed. 
 Oh, you know what these lawyers are like. 
 No time for the details. 
 Sorry, this lot's in triplicate, but I'm, uh, happy to run that through for you if you leave it. 
 Unless it's highly confidential. 
 Oh, no. 
 Annual report on environmental law, no. 
 How many copies? 
 One. Both sides. 
 Saving paper. Saving the planet. 
 You should be reported. 
 Well, don't staple it. 
 Use a paper clip. 
 They're in here. 
 Of course. 
 (DANCE MUSIC BLARES) 
 If memory serves me well, you and I managed to get our heart rate up on something that looked a little this bench press. 
 I can hardly remember. The whole night was a blur. 
 For you, maybe. 
 Uh, Madison Norris? 
 Oh, my three o'clock? 
 Oh, you know our couple's deal is still good for this month. 
 Josephine Newton. 
 Lewis Hughes. 
 Uh... 
 Sorry, I told you when you rang you're wasting your time. 
 I've got nothing else to add. 
 In fact, I don't know if I'm even allowed to talk to you. 
 There's no rule against it. 
 You were a friend of Lana's. 
 Yeah, once. 
 I mean, look, losing Dylan has been a total nightmare, but there's a part of me that feels for Lana. 
 I mean, what a mess. 
 Sure. 
 Man : Hey, Madison! 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I don't have time to talk and I've got nothing else to add. 
 I'll see you in court, okay? 
 Hey, Jase! How's it going? 
 Yep, yep. 
 (LAUGHS) Oh, sweetheart. 
 Widowhood suits her. 
 Grief affects everyone differently. 
 Four years ago, Madison Norris filed for divorce, but it was never heard. 
 Huh. Was it a joint application? 
 Uh-uh. 
 We should have a chat to the family solicitor and find out what prompted it. 
 Yeah, I wonder why she had it withdrawn. 
 What would make you go back to a former partner? 
 Well, if I was Madison... 
 Mm. 
 Uh, maybe for the kids. 
 Or maybe the business? 
 It's certainly a flourishing enterprise. 
 Not because you loved him? 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 More cries for help from downstairs? 
 What? No, I told you, we operate completely independently. 
 Why haven't you answered any of my calls? 
 (LAUGHS) Yeah, well, look, I know I said I'd never do pro bono, but it's a man's prerogative to change his mind. 
 He used to be a police officer. 
 An old-school police officer charged with... 
 I've got to go. 
 Assault and refusing to negotiate. 
 Sorry, we'll be five minutes, tops. 
 I was just leaving. Got a late meeting. 
 Okay. 
 The magistrate will show no mercy. 
 Look, so what if this guy used to be a cop? 
 You said he has a witness. It's like a breeze. 
 It's open and shut. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 He needs more than a lowly solicitor who should stick with wills and conveyancing. 
 He needs someone with a gift for oratory... 
 Oh! 
 An extensive vocabulary. 
 And you're the only barrister I know who'll do it for free. 
 Oh, thanks, but I've got a murder trial on. 
 You know that. 
 I will do everything. You only have to walk into court. 
 Oh, and there we have it. 
 Walk into court. 
 Oh! 
 Helena, don't start that. 
 (HYPERVENTILATES) 
 Don't start that. 
 You know how to breathe. 
 Hey, Helena, you are a damn good solicitor. 
 All you have to do is get over your nerves. 
 This is a nice, simple case for you to cut your teeth on. 
 Now get back downstairs and get on with your prep. 
 I know I have neglected you, but please save me from the courts! 
 I couldn't help overhearing that you're looking for a barrister, someone who'll do pro bono. 
 Not that I'm touting or anything. 
 I just thought you should know that I exist. 
 Lana : I don't understand. How could Madison have done this? 
 We're not saying that she did. 
 We just need to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors that someone other than you could have perpetrated the crime. 
 And from what we've uncovered, Madison's relationship with Dylan wasn't as happy as she liked to make out. 
 Were you aware of that? 
 I don't feel very well. 
 I'm sure I'm allergic to the rubbish they're feeding me. 
 Lana, you know if you're convicted you'll get at least 20 years in a maximum security prison, so if there's anything that you do know or could tell us... 
 You don't know what Maddy meant to me. 
 She saved my life, all right? 
 I mean, you've seen the commercial. 
 I was fat and depressed. 
 I mean, Madison got me off my meds for the first time in years, and it was so great. 
 But then Dylan took over. 
 He was waiting to get me. 
 I'm sorry, I don't quite follow. 
 Are you saying he sexually assaulted you? 
 No! 
 Maybe. 
 No, I don't know. 
 All I know is that I stopped him. 
 But Madison thought there was more to it. 
 She called me a slut. 
 And when did she do that? 
 Uh, when she called, on the day that Dylan died. 
 Madison : (ON RECORDING) Yeah, me again. 
 Just wanted to say, don't worry about Dylan. 
 I'll take care of him. 
 You left this voice-mail message for Lana Devries at 8:36pm on the night in question, is that correct? 
 Well, I wouldn't have remembered the exact time, but, yes. 
 When you said, "Don't worry about Dylan, I'll deal with him," what did you mean? 
 Well, they'd just had a massive fight over her contract, and I wanted to let her know I was going to sort it out. 
 And you also said, "Me again." 
 Does that mean that you'd made a previous call? 
 Yes. 
 After watching Lana drive off like a maniac, I was really worried about her. 
 I wanted to make sure she got home all right. 
 I mean, it's hard to imagine now, but back then we were really close. 
 So, you called her, she answered, and you tried to get to the bottom of the altercation that she'd had with your husband, Dylan. 
 Yes. 
 In the course of that conversation, did you or did you not accuse her of having an affair with your husband? 
 Man : Your Honour, there is nothing in the accused's record of interview, nor the witness's statement, to indicate that such a thing was ever discussed. 
 Your Honour, I'm acting on instructions from my client, and evidence will be given to this effect. 
 Judge : Please answer the question. 
 Yes. 
 What did Lana Devries say when you accused her? 
 She denied it. 
 Said she only went to see Dylan to break her contract. 
 But did she also tell you that, in an effort to change her mind, your husband had showered her with flattery and attempted to kiss her, and that's why she became angry and rammed his car? 
 Yes. 
 So, you get off the phone from Lana Devries. 
 Did you immediately call your husband to confront him with these claims? 
 No. 
 By that time, I was home with my children getting them ready for bed. 
 So, all that time, while you fed and bathed the kids, you were stewing away, thinking about how to deal with him, and that's when you decide to call Lana back. 
 Could we please hear the audio again? 
 (ON RECORDING) Yeah, me again. Just wanted to say, don't worry about Dylan. I'll take care of him. 
 "I'll take care of him," in light of what we've heard, takes on a whole new meaning, doesn't it? 
 
 
 
 I love it when it flows like that. 
 Mm. 
 Reminds me of Canberra again. 
 How? 
 The moot. 
 I nailed the key witness on the cross, but you brought it all home in the final address. 
 Yeah, I remember that part. 
 And when we went out and celebrated our victory and it was your idea to break into the hotel gym. 
 Yeah, I was drunk. 
 Not too drunk to put the brakes on. 
 Hm. I was going out with Cal. 
 Callum was off patrolling the Mururoa Atoll and he wouldn't even tell you if he was coming back. 
 Yeah, but he did, and he made a commitment. 
 Some men can't manage that for a weekend. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Lewis Hughes. 
 We'll be right there. 
 As I said, it's called a FormTrack, Your Honour. 
 It monitors and records ever aspect of fitness, and this particular FormTrack belongs to the accused. 
 And why is this only coming to light now? 
 Because when the accused was arrested, the case detective mistakenly believed it was a... piece of plastic jewellery. 
 For some time, it's been held in the evidence room. 
 At Homicide, a junior detective finally made the link and we'll be calling Dr Ryan Watkins of Forensic Services who retrieved the data. 
 And what relevance does the data have to the case? 
 Ooh, yes. 
 Well, one of the many wonders of this latest model FormTrack, Your Honour, is that it has a built-in GPS, and on the night in question, the data indicates that there was movement between the home of the accused and the Total Control Fitness studio at the precise time of Dylan Norris's death. 
 Mr Hughes... do you have anything to say about this? 
 Your Honour, like your good self... 
 (WAILING) the defence finds this sudden revelation deeply unsatisfactory. 
 Therefore, we'd like to request an adjournment... 
 (WAILS) 
 Mrs Devries, please try and control yourself. 
 But this means it had to be me! (CRIES) 
 They've even got her heart rate here. 
 That's mainly what fitness data is, Lewis. 
 You really are totally uninterested in exercise, aren't you? 
 43 beats per minute. Is that good? 
 That's asleep. 
 Oh. 
 195? That's way up there. 
 That's either a heart attack or... a murder. 
 That must be when the dumbbell came down. 
 We could try insane automatism as a defence. 
 Yeah, I was just going to say that. Insane automatism? Are you mad? 
 Well, she said she was suffering from depression and having suicidal thoughts. 
 Suicidal thoughts are not homicidal thoughts. 
 And her husband said that she was heading for a breakdown. 
 And she described that weird fugue state. 
 Mm. 
 I mean, how can she be held responsible for her actions? 
 Who's going to tell the judge we're doing a U-turn? 
 He might not be that surprised. 
 He did see her having a breakdown in the dock. 
 I think she would take a closer look at Lana's medical history and get a current psych report. 
 So, not guilty by virtue of mental impairment. 
 Ah, see? When you say it right, it just sounds totally reasonable. 
 And I can't see how else to save her from a long jail sentence. 
 Got the wrong sized toner! (GRUMBLES) 
 I hate to tell you this, but the old Russian bird's pulled the pin. 
 Why? She was our only witness. 
 Well, it's obvious. The b*st*rd's gotten to her. 
 Come off it, Dad. 
 He's a retirement village manager, not a drug lord. 
 How about I go and talk to her? 
 No, he knows you're my kid. 
 Plus, he'd be all over the Russian like a hawk. 
 Well, why don't I go instead? 
 That sounds good. 
 Dad, he's the office boy, when he's not running a car wash. 
 I think Johnny could be spared. 
 Fine. 
 But I'm the professional investigator. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 As long as I drive. 
 She's so much like Eleanor it scares me. 
 Your wife? 
 Yeah. 
 She was always calling the shots and whipping me into line. 
 How long ago did she pass? 
 Bit over a year now. That's why I moved into the villa. 
 New chapter. Plus it's easier for Skye as well. 
 She's always over there at the house fussing about something. 
 I don't really understand why she's taken so much time off work. 
 I mean, she's on a good wicket there at the insurance company. 
 Yeah, good luck making her listen. 
 Afternoon! 
 Is the manager in? 
 That'd be me. 
 Johnny Allbright. I'm interested in taking a tour of the place. 
 Sure. 
 Yeah, me, uh... Me Nan's getting on a bit. 
 She's a bit, uh, worse for wear, you know. 
 Right. 
 So, she's had to start wearing those orthopaedic stretchable shoes, 'cause she has diabetes. 
 Right. 
 And her house is full of stairs, so I was looking for somewhere a bit more... have some paperwork you'd like to show me? 
 (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
 I know you're at home, Mrs Lazarenko. 
 I saw you at the window! 
 Tomorrow? I don't know. That might be her hydrotherapy day Sorry I'm late with my Wi-Fi fee. (LAUGHS) 
 My daughter's moved to New Zealand so we do that Skype-y. 
 That's nice. 
 I'll have to charge you interest next time, Beverly. 
 Oh! I saw that lass before. 
 Mm-hm. 
 You know, the daughter of the old copper who broke your arm? 
 Eh? 
 And I don't think she signed in. 
 Uh, hey. 
 Did she sign in? 
 No, she didn't. 
 Actually, I know you get huffy when people forget! 
 I think Nan does hydrotherapy on a Thursday so a tour tomorrow should be fine. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm not going to leave until you talk to me! 
 I mean it! 
 If I'm going to have to stand here all day and keep on knocking, then that's what I'll do. 
 Oh! 
 In! In! Away from the window! 
 Sure, no worries. I'm Skye. 
 I know who you are. And I know why you are here. 
 Great, because I would really like to know why you suddenly changed your mind about being my dad's witness. 
 (TABLET CHIMES) 
 Ohh! 
 'Glug' is a word? No. 
 Yeah. 
 No! 
 Mm. 
 If you put 'gulag' in the same spot, you could get a double word score. 
 Yeah. 
 (MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY) 
 Oh, 14 points, not great. 
 But no shame. 
 I have opponents all over the world. 
 That must keep you busy. 
 But about my Dad... 
 Oh, I saw nothing. 
 But why did you say you did? 
 I'm an old woman. I get confused. 
 You're playing an international word game, in English, which is not your first language. 
 You're not confused. 
 (KNOCKING AT DOOR) 
 Mrs Lazarenko! 
 Are you there? 
 It's him! 
 We need to talk. 
 Oh, hello! Come in, come in! 
 What word...? 
 What word is that... that... a word that uses four Os? 
 Oi! 
 Come on! 
 Stop! Oi! 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go! 
 You had one job! One job! 
 Distract the manager, and you couldn't even do that! 
 Well, if you'd kept a low profile like we planned! 
 Did you get anywhere? 
 There wasn't time. 
 Oh, so much for the trained professional. 
 Wait a minute! Wait! Oi! 
 Look, I'm sure you'd rather I wasn't there in court distracting you. 
 What? No. 
 I need you at the table if I'm going to come in late on this. 
 But it's very straightforward, as long as we have our eyewitness. 
 (PHONE CHIMES) 
 The witness is definitely out. 
 But what we do have... is a dead rose... by the name of Eleanor, the same name as Mr Stewart's wife. 
 That means the rosebush is more than just a rosebush. 
 It was a memorial. 
 And that helps us how? 
 Well, we can argue self-defence. 
 By snatching the spade off the manager, Mr Stewart was defending a most precious piece of property. 
 It is a highly emotional and deeply moving argument. 
 If you want that kind of tear-jerker angle, you've chosen the wrong man. 
 Mm. 
 Ah, if you'd excuse me for a moment. 
 I can cope with the fact that you blatantly ignored my advice to handle this case on your own, but do you know who that is in there? 
 Of course. It's Whitley's godson. 
 And my client, from not very long ago, accused of a very serious charge. 
 Really? Was he found guilty? 
 No, 'cause I'm a brilliant barrister. 
 And that's not the point. 
 Look, Mr Allen was more than happy to take this case pro bono. 
 Yeah, I bet he was. 
 In case you've forgotten, it's not so long ago that I myself was unjustly accused of a crime, and I can tell you, that is a lonely place. 
 Yeah, no, you're right. 
 It's great that you're giving Craig a break. 
 Thank you. 
 So, tell me, what crime was he accused of? 
 Oh, no, it's not important. 
 Like you said, he was found not guilty. 
 So, we're talking criminal. 
 Mm, technically, yes. 
 Indictable? 
 Look, it was just a misunderstanding, I'm sure, between Craig and a senior colleague. 
 Oh, that can happen. 
 Mm. 
 So, the charge... 
 Is everything under control in here? 
 Yep. Be right there. 
 Murder. 
 Mr Allen... about this memorial rose. 
 Have you heard the expression 'beggars cannot be choosers'? 
 She told you, didn't she? 
 We are both beggars, Mr Allen. 
 I am a desperate woman, but Mr Stewart is an ex-policeman and if he were to find out that his barrister had once been suspected of murder... 
 Okay. Let's show some emotion. 
 See young Craig's back on his horse? What a relief. 
 I'll be relieved when those slippers go back in the cupboard. 
 This time, lock it and throw away the key. 
 No way! These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. 
 Make me feel like a... like a sultan. 
 Which makes you... my precious sultana. 
 What am I supposed to do with these? 
 Well, we just have a few more questions about your medical history. 
 For starters, in the five years when you were taking the heavy anti-depressants, we noticed you changed doctors eight times. 
 Why was that? 
 Well, I... 
 They were all quacks. 
 Never gave her the attention she needed. 
 They could never get her medication right. 
 Except for Dr Tran. 
 He was the one who suggested she get a personal trainer, start to exercise. 
 And that's when you met Madison? 
 Well, from the time you started going to the gym, you didn't fill out another prescription until about a month before the death of Mr Norris. 
 What made you start taking them again? 
 I was really worried about her. 
 I mean, this whole fitness thing. Yeah, it's great in theory. 
 But then she became obsessed with exercise, losing weight. 
 At the time of Mr Norris's death, you were on this medication? 
 Some of the days. 
 Well, a lot of the days, actually, I'd just skip them because they were making me feel all foggy again. 
 But maybe if I'd done the right thing and taken them like you said... 
 Oh, Andy, I'm so sorry! (SOBS) 
 I loved you the way you were. 
 I just wanted to be better for you! 
 I don't get it. He loves her whatever shape she's in. 
 That's the official policy line, isn't it? 
 Ah, he didn't say that. 
 He said he loved her the way she was, past tense. 
 And did you notice that whenever we asked Lana a question, she looked to him to answer it? 
 She's clearly not well. 
 And very dependent on him. 
 I'm just happy they agreed to change strategy. 
 The mental impairment argument is strong, if we ignore the year she was training and medication-free. 
 And just because she went off her meds doesn't mean her mental health was stable. 
 What about the online community, the FormTrack forum? 
 Oh, "Share your fitness journey"? 
 Yeah, we could look at her posts. 
 Get a clearer picture of her head space. 
 I can work late, if you can. 
 Yeah. I'll call Lydia, let her know.

 Here. "Just signed a contract to help Dylan promo his studio. #TotalControlFitness #Lovinglife." 
 394 likes and way too many flexed bicep emojis and smiley faces. 
 Ah, look at this. 
 "Hey Lana, props to you for your awesome weight loss. I just hope Dylan from Total Control doesn't totally exploit you like he did to me. PM me for details. JenJen83." 
 'Exploit' is the word that Lana used. 
 Mm. 
 We have to find out who JenJen is. 
 First thing tomorrow. 
 Mm. 
 What'd you mean when you said "Some men can't commit"? 
 Sorry? 
 At lunch. You were aiming at me. 
 Oh, we don't need to rake over old coals. 
 Yeah, we do, because I committed. 
 I proved I was serious, like you said, and you're the one who never showed up the next day. 
 What are you talking about? I sat in that cafe for an hour. 
 Why didn't I see you then? 
 Well, why didn't I see you? 
 I don't know. It's a pretty small place. 
 No, it wasn't. It had two levels. 
 I kept going up and down to see where you were. 
 The cafe at the train station? 
 No. 
 No, we said the bus stop. 
 (HOOVER WHIRRING APPROACHES) 
 So sorry. 
 Don't be, Zareb. 
 We're almost done. 
 What happened, Ms Newton? 
 I can see the carpet. 
 (LAUGHS) Wasn't me! 
 Maybe you should keep this man. 
 Good morning, Madison. 
 Only my clients are welcome in my fitness studio. 
 I'd like you to leave. 
 I'm just trying to find out about... 
 I don't believe you! 
 After you people humiliated me in court. 
 Yeah, I can understand how you feel, but I'm just trying to find out about JenJen83. 
 So, I gather you know who I'm talking about? 
 Yeah, of course I do. 
 She slagged off our gym online, and then none of it was true and we didn't even know who it was. 
 Well, I have a hunch that she's the person who convinced Lana to break her contract with you. 
 Well, that wouldn't surprise me. 
 Lana was always swayed by the strongest voice. 
 But whatever happens to her now, I really don't care. 
 I'll let you show yourself out. 
 Thanks. 
 43 beats per minute. 43. 
 Thank you! 
 Oh, really, Jonathan, if you're going to work here, you need to smarten yourself up. 
 You're not at university any longer. 
 Yeah, you're right. Sorry. 
 Oh. Look, I'm sorry. I just... 
 I could've sworn that I had spare toner in here, and now the supplier's just told me he can't deliver another one until after lunch and so all of this morning's copying has to go out, and it's a big waste of my time. 
 And money. 
 Hey, if it helps you out, I've got a mate who's a courier. 
 He can pick up and deliver anything you want within half an hour. 
 Seriously? 
 Yeah, just write down the model number and I'll make it happen. 
 Zareb! Zareb, no! 
 Can you take that cartridge back downstairs for me? 
 Recycling. That is good. 
 Just don't let anyone see. 
 A drive in the Charger? 
 Deal. 
 So, what would explain that kind of heart rate? 
 Same profile, healthy adult female, same age? 
 That's really helpful. Thanks, Sharon. 
 Five years? I thought it was a bit overdue. 
 (WHISPERS) Special courier delivery. 
 Um, okay, yeah, I promise. I'll make an appointment. 
 Oh, thank you! 
 You're welcome, Jackie. 
 What size shoe do you take? 
 10. 
 I thought so. 
 Definitely. Definitely. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Do you have a bossy GP? 
 Oh, no, that's right. You never get sick. 
 Well, my doctor said the resting heart rate in a woman like Lana is 54 beats per minute, so 43, even if she's asleep, is way below. 
 So, what are we saying, Lana was in a trance? 
 To have a resting heart rate that low, you'd have to be drugged. 
 Sleeping-pills, anti-depressants... 
 Well, yeah, but they take time to work. 
 And then it goes through the roof, the heart rate, around Dylan's death. 
 Well, that makes sense. 
 Well, then it drops a lot. 
 Well, look, she's practically unconscious. 
 That can't happen in one person. 
 That means someone else was wearing Lana's FormTrack. 
 Craig : In conclusion, the prosecution has failed to prove my client guilty of common assault because Mr Stewart was rightfully defending his property from damage by the manager of Seaview Retirement Villas. 
 And I would ask the question, Your Honour, what would make a man who enforced the law his entire working life become a flagrant rule breaker in his twilight years? 
 I'll tell you what. 
 Love. 
 Frank Stewart was blissfully married to his high school sweetheart, Eleanor, for almost 50 years until, after a long and painful battle with cancer, she finally succumbed. 
 Bereft, Frank sold the family home and moved to Seaview Retirement Villas, where he decided to plant a rose, an Eleanor rose... as a fitting memorial to his late wife, one year after her passing. 
 So, can you imagine how he felt on that awful morning, when he saw the manager hacking away at his precious rose, wrenching it from the earth and desecrating his shrine to his dearly beloved... Eleanor? 
 So, of course he wrestled the spade from the manager's hands to defend his precious property from attack. 
 Therefore, Your Honour, I seek that my client, this sad and lonely grief-stricken widower, be acquitted of all wrongdoing and be left to mourn in peace. 
 I have to say, I never would've thought that any descendant of Justice Percy Allen would be capable of employing such an emotional, heartfelt horticultural simile. 
 However, there is still a man who, in the course of carrying out his workplace duties, has been seriously injured, and to argue self-defence of property, irrespective of its sentimentality, draws an exceptionally long bow, so I'll expect you to improve on that argument when we resume after lunch. 
 What the hell was going on back in there, about my wife? 
 That's private. 
 You agreed I could argue defence of property. 
 Yeah, well, I thought you'd make me out as some roughty-toughty sort of a bloke. 
 Instead, you make me look like I'm a loser. 
 Why didn't you tell me you planted that rose bush for Mum? 
 I didn't tell 'em. They must've worked it out. 
 Why didn't you tell me you got the sack? 
 I rang them and they said that you got the arse because you tipped off some lawyers about some big insurance case. 
 (GASPS) Oh, Ms Stewart, I'm so sorry to hear that. 
 I'm sorry too, but do you mind telling me how we can win this case? 
 Let me have a little think. 
 Bottom line, that eyewitness has to talk. 
 But I told you, she's Russian and the manager's like the KGB. 
 Then discredit him. 
 Find a way to undermine his influence. 
 What's he like? 
 He ripped off this woman who was late paying her Wi-Fi fees. 
 What were you doing back up there? 
 Photocopying. 
 Nice shoes! 
 Ooh! 
 Please, our time is limited. 
 What Wi-Fi fee? Why is she paying him anything? 
 The guidebook said that all Seaview residents have free internet. 
 Now, there's a little thread to pull! 
 When you're ready. 
 Mrs Lazarenko? 
 Can you let us in? It's really important that we talk to you. 
 Go away! 
 Mrs Lazarenko, I know you're scared, but we're here to tell you that you don't have to be afraid anymore. 
 You see, my colleague and I, we've been talking to the other residents and it turns out the manager has been ripping you off. 
 He's been overcharging you for the internet. 
 He'll probably go to jail, or at the very least, lose his job. 
 So, what we're saying is, if you want to speak out against him for what he's done to my Dad, you can, and it'll be okay. 
 We'll make sure of it. 
 We can't wait any longer. We'll have to go in without them. 
 Don't mind me. Just an interested observer. 
 Wait! We've got your witness. 
 And an angry resident for good measure. 
 Too bloody right! 
 The amount of money I've paid that man, I could have flown to Auckland half a dozen times. 
 Mm, and you can get him on threatening a witness. 
 He said he'd cut off Zora's internet if she talked. 
 I am sorry. I was afraid. 
 (SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN) 
 It's all right, love. You're here now. 
 Let's go and crush the b*st*rd, shall we? 
 Yeah! (LAUGHS) 
 Just so you know, I won't be charging your father for my services. 
 Johnny : Oi, hang on! 
 Ms Stewart lost her job because she helped us with that insurance case. 
 But if there's anything I can do. 
 I hear you have some insurance problems of your own. 
 A stalled payout after a fire at your last premises? 
 You're on. But we're not settling for anything less than full value. 
 So, Mr Watkins, if the FormTrack was swapped from one person's wrist to another, it would simply keep recording data? 
 Yes. 
 So, going back to the FormTrack forum, can you confirm that a FormTrack member, known as JenJen83, posted 24 private messages to Lana Devries over a two-week period? 
 Yes. 
 And that the messages included, "Break the contract before that creep owns you. 
 "Escape while you still can"? 
 That's correct. 
 Lastly, Mr Watkins, could you please tell us who owns the IP address for JenJen83? 
 Yes, it belongs to Mr Andrew Devries, husband of the accused. 
 Lana : Andy was trying to save me. 
 He drugged you. Framed you for murder. 
 You were getting happier and healthier and he didn't want to lose you. 
 No, he'd rather you were locked away for 20 years. 
 Andy : Lana? Lana! 
 Wait for me? 
 Man : You have to come with us, sir. 
 Wait for me! 
 Lana! Promise me! 
 You'll be okay. 
 Come on, come here. 
 (SOBS) 
 Did you really wait at the train station that day?

 Yes, but I wasn't in possession of all the facts.
