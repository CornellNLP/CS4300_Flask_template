 STEPHEN: My name is Stephen Jameson. 
 I'm one of the Tomorrow People. 
 They call our powers the three T's. 
 Telepathy... 
 CARA: Stephen? 
 STEPHEN: Telekinesis... 
 And teleportation. 
 There is a shadow war going on between us and Ultra... 
 No!... the secret organization that hunts us. 
 The only way to keep my species from going extinct is to find my father. 
 And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy. 
 JEDIKIAH: Previously on The Tomorrow People... Wait, are you telling me my dad was like you? I guess you could call him our leader. I can't believe my brother put you up to this. You don't have to do this, John. (GUNSHOT) (GROANS) All these years, I've been leading the Tomorrow People on a search for a dead man. You've promised us a future, a way to find the Refuge... You lied to them. It's about my dad. He's alive. I saw him. And we're gonna figure out how to find him. Limbo exists in the time between life and death. What exactly are you saying? You have to try to kill me. Heart rate? TIM: I've ceased to detect it. Come on, Stephen. Come on. Come back to us. I'm not letting you die. Dad? Stephen. Look at you. Dad, I'm here to bring you back. How did you find this place? Same way you did. You can stop time. Like me. Yeah. Tell me quick. Your mom... Yeah, she's safe. And Luca? Dad, they're both safe. They need you. We all do. John is doing everything he can to protect our kind. But Ultra's grown too strong. The Founder, he's... The Founder? Does he know about your powers? Yeah, why? If he uses you the way he tried to use me then it's not just our species in peril. Listen to me. You have to find Simon Plame. What are you talking about? Why don't you come back with me? I can't. Not until you find my body. You have to go. Now. Why... Find Simon Plame. He'll explain everything. No, Dad... Find Simon Plame! Dad, no. Dad! (GASPING) What happened? I saw him. We have to find my dad's body. (BREATHING HEAVILY) It's being guarded by someone named Simon Plame, I think. Hey, take it easy. Find his body, like dig him up? I don't know. You guys pulled me out before I could get the whole story. Stephen, you were technically dead. How can you be sure of what you saw? Okay, check my memory. (PULSATING) Sorry, Stephen, I can't see anything. This wasn't some figment of my imagination, okay? Where would the name Simon Plame have come from? Maybe you heard it somewhere. Yeah, just now, from my dad. Cara, we have to be open to the possibility that the experiment worked. Tim, pull up everything you have on Simon Plame. TIM: Simon Plame. Born April 6, 1964. One of the original breakouts. I only have access to his declassified dossier. There's no further record of him since, well... the time of your father's disappearance. Stephen. We all wish your father was still alive. He is still alive. Hey, relax. We believe you. Good. 'Cause I'm bringing him home. With or without your help. STEPHEN: Hey, sorry I'm late. Oh, you made it. Thank you. Mmm-hmm. You look like death. Like patient zero in the zombie apocalypse. Luca. Yeah, I just need a little sleep, okay? You, on the other hand, look awesome. New hair style or... (CHUCKLING) I was just playing around a little bit, but thank you for noticing. New boyfriend. C'mon, I've gone on two dates. LUCA: With number three on the books. Boyfriend. Cool. Something to drink? Uh, water, please. Hello? Could you be less psyched for Mom? I'm psyched for her. Oh, my bad, must be misreading the full-on scowl you're rocking. MARLA: Ice or no ice, honey? No ice. I'm just thinking about Dad. What if he comes home? Really? We don't know, he could walk through that door any day. Bro, Dad's been gone for a decade. MORGAN: And... voilà. Less rebel, more rebel leader. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Good look. Thanks, Morgan. You got it. Look, I understand Stephen is desperate to believe his father is still alive, but you, of all people, should not be giving him false hope. Stephen is going to do what he wants to do. Regardless of what we think. If Roger was still out there, I would have seen it when I read Stephen's mind. Roger was the only one who could have turned the tide in this war. If there is any possibility that he is out there... And you killed him. And then you lied about it to all of us. And now, worst of all? You're taking advantage of Stephen's vulnerability to make yourself feel better. I believe that Stephen saw his father. Even if Stephen has forgiven you, it doesn't mean that your sins have been erased. You're right. You're absolutely right. I've been lying for way too long. I'm going to convene a council. Tell everyone the truth. No, John! Cara, they deserve to know who I really am. I deserve to know and look what happened to us. What do you think the others will do when they find out that you've been lying all this time? That's a risk I'm willing to take. ____ (TAPPING) ORDERLY: Come on, Errol, you know the drill. Put 'em where we can see 'em. Wouldn't want you using your powers out here, now, would we? Yeah, you too. Come on, let's go, Miggs. Come on, man. How many times have we done this? Hands. The boys in the lab got a big night planned for you clowns. Hope you're excited. Both of 'em, man. Now. (CACKLING) (GRUNTING) (BEEPING) Thanks for the hand, Miggs. ORDERLY: We got a breach! This one's for you. Errol? Don't move, Errol. (CACKLING) (BANGING ON DOOR) Errol? I'm guessing you're the AI interface? ALICE: Hello, Stephen. You may call me Alice. You're a girl. I'm a computer. Computers don't have genders. My name stands for Artificial Linguistic Intelligence Computer Entity. I think I'll call you Alice. That's what I told you to call me. Now, how can I help you? I need to access the file of a former employee. Simon Plame. And I assume that you've been authorized to access that file? Yeah, of course. I don't like being lied to. Who said I was lying? You did. I analyzed your voice patterns. Constricted larynx, accelerated breathing. All consistent markers for lying. You know what? Just forget it. (DOOR LOCKING) What are you doing? Unlock the door. Your uncle was very specific with his instructions. If anyone tried to access that file, I was to notify him immediately. Okay, you don't have to do that. Already done. Simon Plame. Well, who on Earth could have given you that name? (COMPUTER PROCESSING) My dad. I found a box of his old research notebooks. Stephen, you should know that towards the end your father was... delusional. He was obsessed with reaching parallel dimensions, he saw enemies where there were friends. He was a threat to himself and your family. If that was true, then maybe Simon Plame can confirm it. Well, I'm afraid that's impossible. ALICE: Routing information to your tablet, sir. (ALARM BLARING) What is that? Thank you, Alice. Looks like we have a breakout. What's with the air raid siren, we have new breakouts all the time. This isn't your garden variety breakout, Stephen, the inmates we house at our sister facility are quite... Inmates? Ultra has a prison? More like a research facility. There he is. Hello, Errol. I'm going to ask you one more time. Who called the police? You call my wife and you tell her to come home. Now. I don't know where to call. She hasn't lived here in years. I live here now. (GASPING) Why are you lying to me? Please, let me go. (DOOR OPENING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) STEPHEN: Hey, Errol. We'll take you to see your wife. WOMAN: Who would marry this lunatic? I'm not a lunatic. They did this to me. I didn't say anything. ULTRA AGENT: Just let her go. You don't want to hurt the nice lady, do you? Why shouldn't I hurt her? You people took everything from me. Hey, okay, all right. Errol, I'm unarmed. Just let her go. (THINKING) Errol, can't you see I'm like you? ERROL: (THINKING) Stay out of my head. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) (OBJECTS SHATTERING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) You lied to us. I know I let you all down. But most of all, I let Roger down. Stephen believes that his father is stuck in limbo. So do I. So from here on out, I promise to do everything in my power to find him. You're just an Ultra freak who can kill. Why should we even let you stay in the lair? That is not up for debate. It's not like John volunteered for Ultra. He was captured, lied to, experimented on. All so Jedikiah could turn him into a weapon. I don't need you to defend me, Cara. 'Cause you're doing such a good job defending yourself? John made a mistake. Now he's asking for your forgiveness. Nothing's changed. Except now we know where Roger is. Stuck in some freaky spirit world. Yeah, says John. The guy that shot him. What's going on? Don't ask. MIKE: Come on, guys. Why should we even trust this guy anymore? Where have you been? Don't ask. I am telling you all this, so that we can start over with a clean slate. Until we find Roger, you're stuck with me. My leadership... MIKE: Are you sure about that? Anyone can lead if they get more votes than you. Are you going to challenge me, Mike? No. I didn't think so. I nominate Cara. What? No! MIKE: Yes, yes, yes. All in favor of a vote. MIKE: I vote for Cara. (THINKING) My vote's for Cara. Do I vote? You don't live among us. Good. I'm sorry, but this sucks. John's kept us alive this long. My vote's for him. MIKE: Well, well, well. Looks like we have a new leader. (ALL CHEERING) John, I swear, I didn't want this to happen. But you got it. Good luck. Jedikiah said that Errol was some kind of research subject  at an off-site Ultra facility. What? It's called the Citadel. I thought that... I thought that place was made up. Like some Tomorrow Person boogie man. Where do you think the Annex Project originated? Mutilations, deprivation, all in the name of testing the limits on our powers. In some cases, expanding our powers. When I was inside Errol's mind, he... he did this thing, he... Forced me out of his head. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) He pushed you. Only the most powerful telepaths can do it. Must be why Jedikiah used him as a guinea pig. That guy is lucky. No one's ever escaped the Citadel. Or broken in. First, we find Errol. Then, we get him to lead us to Jedikiah's house of horrors. Errol is right here, right now, and he can lead us to a facility full of people just like us who are being experimented on. That's more than we can save in a whole year of tracking individual breakouts. JOHN: She's right, Stephen. This is the first real lead we've ever had on finding the Citadel. Okay, but it's easier said than done. Ultra's going to be all over this guy. And you are going to be all over Ultra. The minute they get a bead on him, I want to hear from you. We're turning up the heat on Jedikiah. Starting now. MARLA: Okay, so I'll be home around 10. Just remember when you take the lasagna out, to turn off the oven. Mom, we know how to get the lasagna out without burning the house down. I know. Okay, how do I look? (HORN HONKING) Is that him? Classy. (MARLA SCOFFING) Sweet ride. If he has vanity license plates, I am ending this. I told him to honk because I wasn't sure if I was ready for the streams to cross just yet. Are you kidding me? Is that a Ghostbusters reference? You are way too cool for this guy. (LUCA WHISTLING) What are you doing? Inviting him in. No. Yes, see how he holds up under a little heat. (SIGHING) Look, you guys, I know this is weird to see your mom go on a date. But I want you to know, whatever happens, you two always come first. Okay? Hey, uh... Peter. And you must be Luca. The one and only. All right. Uh, this is my brother... Stephen, of course. Sorry about the honking. Your mom's idea. I guess she didn't want us three to cross streams. Uh... Ghostbusters? The second one. Yeah, they got it. (LAUGHING) What time are the reservations? Uh, soon, actually. Okay, away we go. Have fun. See you later. Yeah, nice meeting you. Yeah, you too, Pete. When Ultra captures Errol, they'll bring him back to the mothership in one of these. Once they're on the move, Stephen will let us know timing and route. And then what? We'll take it from there. Until then, rest up. MIKE: Yes! All right, let's go. WOMAN: Oh, man. We'll take it from there? Wanna be a little more specific? Your uncle can't suspect an ambush. The best way for you to act surprised is to be surprised. That's the plan. I thought the plan was to find my dad. Right, I'm sorry. You don't believe I can bring him back. Honestly, I don't know what I believe. But I think you're so invested in the idea of bringing him back that you've lost sight of our other priorities. Look, I get it. He's your dad, but... I have to do what I think is best for all of us. Right now, that's finding Errol. Now, can I count on you or not? Yes, of course you can. I'll stick to the plan. 
 
 ULTRA AGENT: Poor b*st*rd. Local PD found this one wandering outside his wife's old office like a lost dog. Almost feel bad for the guy. (ERROL SHIVERING) Please. Don't make me go back. Please. My wife is looking for me, please. (THINKING) We just picked him up. Cara, can you hear me? What's the location? You don't know what they did to me. (THINKING) Warehouse at Hillside and Parsons. Please, just kill me. (THINKING) Just look for the tank. Please kill me! Kill me, please! You don't know what they did to me, please! You're gonna be okay. (ENGINE STARTING) (TIRES SCREECHING) What the hell is that? (WHOOSHING) Woah, woah, woah. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm going to check it out. No. You stay here. (GRUNTING) (BEEPING) You're safe now, Errol. So what's the plan? Punch me in the jaw again? Something like that. (GUN COCKING) ERROL: What are you doing? It's okay. No, really. What the hell are you doing? Jedikiah needs to believe this was a legit ambush. The only way he won't question what happened... Is if you take a bullet. Hold still, will you? You're enjoying this, aren't you? I'll try not to hit anything too important. (GROANING) Dispatch the TAC team, and put any breakout sweeps on hold. I want all resources focused on Errol Chasen, is that clear? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Very good. Are you smiling? Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm... Quite incensed about this brazen attack, but, uh... I have to say, I'm a little bit relieved. That I'm not dead? No. That you took a bullet for Ultra. Literally. That should put to bed questions any doubting Thomases have about your loyalty. (GRUNTING) Really, we're not passed that? Where'd you find this guy? Butcher shop? So I'm assuming your friends were behind this ambush? Friends don't shoot each other. Hmm. (GROANING) What kind of prison is this? Dude, relax. Can I get you something? Are you hungry? (THINKING) How about I fix you a hot pocket? (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) Ahh! Ah. He doesn't like hot pockets. He's powerful and unstable. We should cuff him. He isn't a prisoner. Errol? (THINKING) Errol, it's okay, you're safe here. Where is Ultra hiding my wife? No one is hiding her. She lives in Phoenix now. She teaches high school. She remarried three years ago. (VOICE BREAKING) Three years? She thought you were dead. No. No, it was so much worse than that. They took me apart. Piece by piece. Until there was nothing left of me. We can't give you your old life back. But we can help you see to it that no one has to endure what you went through at the Citadel ever again. We never knew where we were being housed. What about when you escaped? I teleported to the first place I could think of. The Trinity Church in the East Village. Tim, pull up a radius of possible teleports. TIM: Given Errol's powers,  the Citadel must be located within this zone. What else do you remember? I've blocked most of it out. Here. Let me remember for you. (SCREAMING) I see a doctor. What else? In his coat, there's a folded newspaper. Does the newspaper have a name? All I'm getting is N-E-W. TIM: There are 19 New York and Connecticut dailies starting with the prefix "new." JOHN: Come on, Errol, we're getting closer. (YELLING AND SCREAMING) I don't want to go to the... (LAUGHING) Please, don't make me go! Stay with me, Errol. What else is inside that cell? What's outside that window? (MUMBLING) No more. It's okay. You did great. I saw an apple orchard. TIM: New Kane is the only town that matches those parameters. Russell. Tell the team to suit up. On it. JOHN: You already scored big. I mean, I wish I'd have thought to hijack an Ultra transport. But Jedikiah's antennae are way up. Maybe we should just take a beat. The longer we wait, the more time Jedikiah has to put reinforcements in. You didn't see what I saw inside Errol's head, John. People are being tortured as we speak. It's aggressive. It is a calculated risk. I'm not going to back away from what I think is right. And the people out there, they need this to happen. And so do the people down here. I need you to have my back. I do. But you're talking about breaking in to the Citadel. Which is why I want you to stay here. You and Tim will be my eyes and ears. While you risk your life. No way. How many times did you run point while I manned the screens? Besides, I need somebody to guard Morgan. This plan goes sideways, she's our "get out of jail free" card. You mean hostage? Collateral. She's Jedikiah's weak spot and I will use her if I have to. The Annex Project? What that man did to you? I am not letting another one of us suffer that fate. JEDIKIAH: No sign of Chasen or his kidnappers? It's quiet out there, wouldn't worry about it. Errol's practically a vegetable. What good is a paranormal like that going to do for the Tomorrow People? (EKG BEEPING) Everything okay? Yeah. Why do you ask? Uh, you just look even more tense than usual. Hmm. No, I'm just thinking about John and Cara. How they wanted me to see the brave and courageous rescue. What do you see? Subterfuge. You see, Errol's kind of a loose cannon. Worthless to their cause. If anything, he's a liability. Yeah, good point. Unless, of course, they're not interested in Errol, but in the Citadel. How's your pain level? It's fine. I can handle it. Yeah, I hate to see you suffering. Double the hydrocodone drip. No, really, that's not necessary. I have to get home and study. School can wait. Your comfort and happiness come first. Even if your powers are out of commission for a little while. (THINKING) Cara. JEDIKIAH: Opiates seem to have funny side-effects. (THINKING) John? John, it's about Cara. (THINKING) Stephen, talk to me. Jedikiah knows. Wait, wait, wait. Errol? I'm Cara. What's your name? Charlotte. It's okay, Charlotte, we're gonna get you out of here. How do you open the cells? The controls are over here. It's disengaged. I've seen the orderlies do this a thousand times. Somebody must be overriding the system. MAN: (ON RADIO) Come in, alpha squad. Are the targets in position? Do you copy? That's a negatory. Targets are not in position. Over. Who is this? Sorry... (MIMICKING STATIC) you're breaking... Cara, they're here. Ultra. We need to get the hell out now. Don't leave me! I need you to buy me more time. ULTRA AGENT: Don't move! You heard the lady. FEMALE ULTRA AGENT: Hands up! Step back. What are you doing? I'm getting her out of here. Your powers won't work on the glass. The cell is resistant. Yeah, we'll see about that. Stay clear. Cara! Cara! We can't save these people. Fine. You take Errol, you get the others, you get out of here. That is an order! MAN: Get up, we're trapped! Get out of here! (WHISPERING) Come on. Where's Errol? Come on. (GUN COCKING) Put the gun down. I am taking her with me. I don't think that's gonna pan out, dear. It is. Unless you want me to walk Morgan through Ultra's front door. Not here to negotiate. If you want your girlfriend to stay alive, you don't have a choice. Well, we've said our goodbyes. What about you and Stephen? I'll be sure to pass yours along. I'm not gonna let you hurt them. (SCREAMING) You know what your problem is? You think your adversaries have the same weaknesses as you. We don't. You are sick. Send the inmate to me. No. Send the girl to me now. I said, "no." (GUN COCKING) Little late to the party, aren't you, John? Are you okay? We're fine. Oh, so this wasn't your plan. That explains the profound recklessness. Get her out of here. Well, you were always better at taking orders than giving them. You know, one day, Cara's going to order me to kill you. And I won't say no. It's okay, Charlotte. This is going to be your new home now. Here. Take a seat here. Thank you. Let's go. What? You and I are paying your boyfriend a little visit. No, no, no, no, please. Please, you know what they'll do to me. That's not my problem. Cara. What are you doing? Showing Jedikiah I'm willing to go as far as he is. Not like this. He shot Errol because he thinks I'm weak. So it's eye for an eye now? You are better than Jedikiah. What does that matter? We have to start playing by his rules if we want to survive. Look at her, Cara. If you can't see that she's one of us, then you are lost as a leader. And we are lost as a people. Ah! He lives. Why didn't you wake me up? My mom must be freaking out. I already took care of it. I called her, told her you fell asleep at your desk doing a research project. 'Course you might have to lose that sling. And she bought that? Stephen, you don't become the head of a covert law enforcement agency without honing some powers of persuasion. And intuition. What's that supposed to mean? Just that Cara used Errol as a pawn in a greater plan. Thank God we nipped that in the bud. Yeah. Good. You know, I'm glad you said that, because I was starting to get the idea that you might have been in on that plan. (SCOFFING) Yeah, obviously. Yeah, interesting... John managed to hit only soft tissue. Now imagine the odds of that, especially when the shooter was a former pupil of mine who could always be counted upon for accuracy. Okay, I am sick and tired of being under your magnifying glass. I work my ass off here and all I get back is suspicion and smoke and mirrors. I have earned the right to be trusted. Noted. Not good enough. You want me to be a good soldier? I need something from you. And what do you think that might be? The truth. Who's Simon Plame? Simon Plame was another student of Professor Crick's. I think he suffered from an overzealous loyalty to your father. Overzealous how? On the day your father was killed, which was a very tragic day, Simon broke into this very building and tried to steal your father's corpse. Can't imagine why. I killed Simon Plame for trying to take your father away from me. I cremated Roger's body myself. Your father's dead. That's the truth. Accept it. Maybe it wasn't Plame. How? I saw the picture. It was him. Okay. So he's dead. That's a setback. Jedikiah cremated my father. No body, no bringing him back from limbo. I don't buy it. Jedikiah's lies tell lies. Do you honestly think that he'd incinerate his own brother? I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't know. Hey. Look, you were right, okay? My dad being out there. It's a pipe dream. But it's my pipe dream. It doesn't matter what I think. I'm not gonna stand in your way. Besides, what the hell do I know? First day on the job, I shoot you, I lead us straight into an ambush. You broke into the Citadel. You saved Charlotte's life. I got Errol killed. No, Errol sacrificed himself so that you could save her. That girl has a future now, thanks to both of you. Appreciate the spin. It's not spin. Look, I took an actual bullet because I believe in you. I believe in both of us. Either I'm going to find the Refuge, or you're going to build one. Right here. Or both. Yeah, okay, or both. Look, I know we're feeling like long shots today, but together? I don't hate our odds. Hey, I'm home. Mmm. All-nighter at the office? Right. Hey, who's the girl? (SIGHING) Wouldn't you like to know? Since when do we have donuts in the house? Oh. Since ol' loverboy started giving Mom the full-court press. Hmm. (CHUCKLING) Hey, there you are. Hi. Rough night? Yeah. Sorry. Want some breakfast? Donuts. No thanks. You remember Peter. Hey. Hey, pal. I just walked in, I promise. I know this looks like the morning after, but... Never crossed my mind, Pete. (LAUGHING) So your mom was just telling me about your internship at the Genetics Institute. Fascinating stuff. Yeah. I'm gonna... Okay. (MURMURING) We can go if you'd like. (PULSATING) (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) Hey, Stephen? You okay, pal? Yeah. Fine.
