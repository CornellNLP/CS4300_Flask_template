 STEPHEN: My name is Stephen Jameson. 
 I'm one of the Tomorrow People, the next step in human evolution. 
 They call our powers the three T's. 
 Telepathy... 
 CARA: Stephen? 
 STEPHEN: Telekinesis... 
 And teleportation. There is a shadow war going on between us and Ultra... No! ... the secret organization that hunts us. The only way to keep my species from going extinct  is to find my father. And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy. Previously on The Tomorrow People... Our kind can't even kill. Yet. But you are one mutation away from acquiring that ability. Jedikiah used brutal drug therapies to fry out the part of the brain that blocks us from killing. It's an invitation to Molly Batchelder's 21st birthday. We get in, we have a few drinks, we get out. JOHN: D Chips. It's an ambush. CARA: Irene! I got her. What are you doing? (PANTING) Breaking protocol. (PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) Thank you. ___ ___ ___ ___ Russell. My name is Russell. ___ ___ ___ ___ Dad, something's happening to me. Sometimes when I'm playing... ___ ___ ___ I did it! (LAUGHS) (CLEARING THROAT) Does that mean I win? Uh, double or nothing? Ok. I'm pretty sure that guy was on to you. Oh, relax. Here, for your brother's steroid fund. Football camp. Same difference. You said you needed dough. This is how we do. Yeah, I just want to help out my mom, but if she knew I was hustling pool, she would kill me. Hey, you guys wanna play a round? I'm looking to break in my new rod. Uh, we were just leaving. It's called a cue, actually. A Vinotchka, to be precise. That is a $10,000 rod. Piper. Charmed, Piper. Russell, Stephen. My dad's. He's got, like, a dozen of 'em. Rich girls. Love 'em. Excuse us for just a second. Hey, how 'bout we quit while we're ahead? (SCOFFING) Sexy pants can afford to lose some. This one's for me. Okay. What do you say we play for a little cheddar? Money? It'll make you a sharper player. It's cheaper than lessons. Go easy on me? Hmm. Yes! (THINKING) Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Russell, she's one of us. (THINKING) Which means she can hear everything we're saying, genius. Isn't that right, Piper? What'd you say? Russell! (PANTING) Nobody hustles Russell. Ugh. Now get the hell away from me. Okay, okay. Easy, Piper. Me and the guy you just cracked in the chest, we're like you. (THINKING) You can read my mind, can't you? I can read yours, too. Oh, yeah? What am I thinking? Oh! That girl's a gamer. (GROANING) What were you two doing in a pool hall? Last time we went topside, three of our own didn't come back. We were tracking new breakouts and stuff. Did you explain to her who we were? We tried. Didn't have time to make our case. She was quick. Like a she-ninja. TIM: I'm sorry to interrupt,  but I have some information for Russell. Lay it on me, Tim. In scanning the newsfeeds, I flagged an item from the Portland Herald. Last night, a local resident suffered a heart attack. His name was listed in the obituary as Chan-Woo Kwon. He passed away this morning. That's my dad. My God, Russell. No, uh... no, we... weren't that close. Excuse me. Think he's all right? He says he is, but... I think he just wants to be alone. Oh, man, of all the days for me to roll him into going up top. Is there a good day to find out your father passed away? Besides, if you two hadn't gone topside, we never would have found out about the new breakout. Yes, thank you for reminding me. I should have brought her in. I should have gotten a read on her. Look, we've all been a bit off lately. It's hard not to be when you watch your friends get gunned down right in front of you. Irene. Oh, I went by the hospital to see my mom. Irene is out of the ICU, but they're keeping her sedated until the swelling reduces. That's great. If they ID her, and they put her in the system... I will make sure she's not on Ultra's radar. JOHN: Cara. Cara! Are we ever gonna talk about this? About what? Ever since you saw me take out that agent, you can barely look me in the eye. You think I'm upset because you can kill? You saved my life. That's not what's come between us, John, I think you know that. Then what? What else have you been protecting me from all this time? I can feel you blocking me out. What are you so afraid of? If everyone finds out that I can kill, that Jedikiah warped me, you think they'd still look up to me? Or would this whole place fall apart? That's what I'm afraid of, Cara. I don't believe you. There's more. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt. Going somewhere? Dad's funeral. Thought you said you weren't close. It just felt like I should be there. Closure and all. Russell, you know the rules. No contact with our human lives. I gotta go home. If it means that I'm not allowed back... It's okay. You can go. Yeah? Yeah. But I'm going with you. You think I'm letting you go cross-country solo? It takes multiple, long-range jumps. I've mapped out a network of zones over the years where you can land safely, lay low, and rest up. Memorial's Saturday afternoon. We better get moving. You know, you can't run away from this conversation, John. We'll talk when I get back. No one in or out of the lair until then. DARCY: Jameson. Hallway. Now. Who's this? I know she's a friend of yours. Astrid Finch? (STAMMERING) Yeah. I've seen her around. She was at our last kill-squad op. She followed you, Stephen. If your uncle decides that she's a liability... Okay, what do you want from me? Nothing. I'm gonna turn a blind eye this one time. But let's be perfectly clear. You cannot mix your old life with your new life. Do you understand? Yeah. Completely. Thank you for giving me a heads up. So, what's on tap for the night shift? It's pretty dead. We have a possible breakout in Hell's Kitchen. African American female. Late teens. CARA: Stephen. Something happen with Irene? No. She's safe for now, but our pool hustler got herself on Ultra's radar. We gotta get a jump. No. No, Stephen, now is not the time. After everything that happened the last time we went above ground, we have to choose our battles. Wow. That is amazing. John's halfway to Oregon. Like he never left. I will hurt you. Bring it. You wanna stick around minding the store for your boyfriend?  That's cool. Guess I'll have to find Piper myself. I am not "minding the store." Look, Cara, I know you want to help this girl. Okay? And John is one guy and one opinion. You're a leader here, too. Why don't you do what you think is right? (CLATTERING) (SHUSHING) Where the hell are we? An abandoned industrial park outside of Akron, Ohio. I was more talking about the metal box we're inside. I hid out here once when I was chasing a breakout. We'll be safe for tonight. So, when was the last time you saw your dad? Couple years ago, maybe? Like I said, we weren't close. When I was a kid, five, I sat down at a piano and I could just play. And my dad got it into his head that I was destined to be a famous pianist. Are you any good?- Hells yeah. It's hard not to be with what he put me through. Six hours a day of practice. Eight on weekends. Sounds intense. That's my old man. Was. If your dad was such a tyrant, why are we doing this? Sorry. Uh-uh, pal. Boss don't like you. (STAMMERING) What did I do? You walked out with 30 grand last week. That's what you did. MAN 1: (THINKING) Pair of sevens. Garbage. MAN 2: (THINKING) No way I'm bluffing. MAN 3: (THINKING) Luckiest kid I've ever seen. Call. Again? No, no. It's my lucky day. No way. I should go. There's nothing lucky about cheating. Where's the rest of it? The 30 grand you walked out with last time. Where is it? (STAMMERING) At home. I'll get it. I swear! I want an address. Now! You don't understand. My dad, if he finds out, he'll kill me. What do you think I'm gonna do to you? What the hell? Honestly, I don't see her coming back to the same pool hall. It's a big city. You wanna bet? It is a big city. It's intimidating. When I first got to town, I hardly left the corner of 63rd and Lex. For three months I ate the same pizza, drank the same cup of coffee. (LAUGHING) What? Nothing. Just tough to imagine you being scared of anything. Buy me a beer? Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Uh, two, um, drafts, please. Got ID, kid? Uh... how 'bout two drafts for me? I'm guessing you didn't have too hard a time fending for yourself. To the kindness of strangers. Is that our girl? I'm glad we didn't bet. Hi! I'm Cara, I just wanna talk. Who the hell are you? I just wanna help. What makes you think I need your help? Because there are others like you. Like us. From all over. Listen to me, Piper, you're in danger unless you trust us. Damn it, it's too late. They're here. Ultra. Piper, you need to do exactly as we... (WHOOSHING) Twice? Seriously? Come on, we gotta jump. No. No, we can't. Too crowded. Just keep walking. That was, um... Smart. We should go. Yeah. Smart. (CELL PHONE RINGING) What is it? Today's paranormal tag in Hell's Kitchen, we've got a 20 on her. No ID, but late teens female. Permission to engage? Granted. Use whatever force necessary. JOHN: Damn it, Russell. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Yeah! Okay, okay, it ain't magic until you do it twice. Ready? Set. Throw! (ALL CHEERING) Yeah! Let's hear it for Trixie, folks! Whoo! Hey, hey, hey. Keep your hands off her. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea, Russell. Johnny, what's up? I want you to meet my new friend. Trix is lookin' to get the hell out of this here crap old town. What the hell, Trix? I didn't say that. Oh, didn't have to, darlin'. Okay, time to go. Let's go. You comin' or what, Trix? Hmm? Try to spend the rest of your life poppin' out rugrats and pretending that you're satisfied by Kyle and his chronic stankbreath? What did you say? Her thoughts, not mine. Though I cannot say that I disagree. (CHUCKLING) (RUSSELL MOANING) Congratulations. You just assaulted a peace officer. Just so you know, I'm not gonna make a habit of, uh, kissing you every time Ultra shows up. That's good to know. So, you getting any hits on your radar? No. Piper's not underground, we gotta hit the streets. That could take all night. You got something else to do? Wait, so, I'm sorry, I'm losing track, which one was Crystal? The one with the big hands? No, no, that was Cheyenne. Seventh grade and actually a total babe. Until she tried to steal my guinea pig and I had to dump her. Crystal was ninth grade band camp. First time I tried to kiss her, she was, uh, soaking a reed in her mouth and I almost choked on it. So, what you're saying is that you only date girls with stripper names and who start with "C?" Well, then I guess you're in luck. Cara. Cara's not a stripper name. Okay. Is it? No. No. It's pretty... stripper-y. You've only been with one guy, really? Just John? What did you expect? I don't know, I mean, at least one or two other conquests. I was 17 and I just wanted to lose it when I left home. And he just swooped in and scooped you up... Okay. All right, Romeo. What about you? More than one. But no Tomorrow People. So? So, you're a televirgin? Um... (CHUCKLING) okay, what does that mean? Is there, like, a separate category? Think about it. Being able to read someone's mind, feel what they're feeling? Emotionally. Physically. It leads to a deeper... I don't know how else to put it... intimacy. I'm getting something. It's Piper, she's around the corner, come on. 
 
 Yeah, thanks Piper. (THINKING) Piper? (THINKING) How... where are you? CARA: I'd be more worried about the Ultra agents about to grab you. CARA: They know you're here. PIPER: I don't believe you. CARA: Look straight in front of you. See those guys coming towards you? CARA: There are more. What do I do now? CARA: Stay calm. Follow my lead. I got her. Where? Wait until you've got the shot. CARA: Ready? Get up and go up the steps. MAN: Oh, my God! What happened? Are you okay? DARCY: Did you get her? No, she's gone. CARA: To your left. CARA: Head for that sign. Lose yourself in that crowd. CARA: See that coffee truck? They're gonna see me. Not if you hurry. Go. What now? Ready to trust us? Good, let's go. Every kid in my part of Bethesda was completely uber-normal. You were either a cheerleader or in the school play, or in the debate club. Except me. I was always in that zero percentile of success. We know what it's like to feel alone, Piper. Treated like freaks. What brought you to New York? I don't know, it's weird. It was like I was just drawn here. It's not weird at all. There's something about our powers that forces us to congregate in one place. But why here? That's what we're trying to figure out. In the meantime, you'll be safe here. Tim says there's something that can't wait. Who's Tim? Is he your leader? He thinks he is. I just feel bad for my parents. I'm sure they miss you. It's not just me. My sister. Bolted when she was 17. Part of what brought me here was... I felt she was here too. That if I just wandered around, I'd bump into her. Gotta admit... it does sound kinda crazy. No. CARA: Stephen. Can I borrow you for a moment? Yeah. We have a problem. Do you have any idea who Piper is? JOHN: Excuse me. Sir. A little help? Can we just teleport our asses out of here, already? You know we can't just disappear in front of these cops. They have alien abductions around these parts all the time. Sir, please. Just keep your mouth shut. What? I know we made some bad choices last night, but my buddy here, his dad just passed away. We're not troublemakers. We're just two guys trying to get to a funeral. Who conveniently don't have a single piece of ID. His name was Chan-Woo Kwon, of Portland, Oregon. That was a beautiful story. You can forget about the funeral. Screw you, man. What is your problem? You. Did I wanna risk crossing the damn country when Ultra's been all over us? Last time I checked, I don't even have a family to go home to. I'm here for you, man. You wanna know what I think? I'm too hungover to mind-read. I think we're stuck in here 'cause you want to be in here. You're stalling. Sneaking off in the night, getting into a bar fight, because you're scared to go home. ___ ___ ___ ___ You never understood, it was your choice to give up Mom's big house, your good job. Your sacrifice was never for me. It was for your own secondhand glory, some payday you think you deserve. And I'm supposed to thank you? For what? For spending my life in this house, practicing, praying you'll finally tell me I'm good enough. You know what you sacrificed, Dad? Me. I... I thought you loved the piano. No, you ruined that too. (BANGING ON DOOR) MAN: Open up, punk. I know you're in there. Son, what have you done? (BANGING CONTINUES) ___ ___ (DOOR OPENING) Where is he? Your Houdini son, where is he? He's out. Check upstairs. You have what you came for. This ain't about money. Your son's a thief. A thief's gotta pay. No, he's an innocent boy. You really don't know your son. Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to ask you one more time, old man, and you listen carefully. Where is he? If someone has to pay, I will. Where's your son? I don't know. (SCREAMS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) Where is he? I don't know. (SCREAMS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GROANS) (BONES CRUNCHING) (SCREAMS ECHOING) You gotta be kidding. Tim doesn't kid. They're sisters. This is a mistake. We never should have brought Piper in. She needs to be protected. Being Darcy's sister doesn't change that. We don't know a thing about this girl. For all we know, she's working for Darcy. No, you would have picked up on it. Okay, Piper is just a scared runaway. What do you recommend? Oh, no. No. You've lost your mind. They deserve a chance to be reunited. Okay? Just at least think it through. I just did. And I came up with about 100 reasons why it's a terrible idea. Darcy may be Ultra, but she also left family behind. If it were my brother, or your sister, wouldn't you want to see her? Wait... she's here? My sister? Do you know where to find her? Piper, your sister works for a secret government program. The people that were after you. STEPHEN: She was captured and put into service along with countless others like us. Why? Because her boss is a demented eugenicist who's goal is to wipe us off the face of the Earth. Understand the risks, Piper. This could end very badly. I need to see her. I hope you know Darcy as well as you think you do. DARCY: Where is she? She's safe. Does she want to see me? Yes. And you can. Under one condition. Our employer cannot know about it. I am a senior field agent. Think about what you are asking me to do. She is all alone. And I know you remember what that was like. I could report you right now. For not turning in a breakout through the proper channels. But you're not going to, are you, Darcy? When can I see her? Next time you two want to raise hell, bring driver's licenses. Story checked out. You're free to go. Sorry for your loss. So, keep going... or go home? You were right. I am scared. I'm scared so... Your dad's gone. Your debt's paid. Nothing to be scared of anymore. I'm scared to see my Mom. I was a coward, I left in shame. How am I going to look her in the eye? Let her see the man you've become. What if she doesn't show? She'll show. Probably doesn't even remember me. How could I forget my baby sister? Ah, look at you. You look beautiful. So, what, you're like a secret agent lady now? And you're a pool hustler? Hey. It pays the bills. How are Mom and Dad? Alive. But they never got over you. Piper, I am so sorry. I never stopped thinking about you. (THINKING) Stephen, it's me. (THINKING) What's going on? I'm with Piper and Darcy. CARA: Yeah, so is Ultra. What? What have you done? It's the right thing. How could you do this to her? It's okay, Piper, I'm gonna to be with you every step of the way. For what? What are you talking about? She's going to take your powers. It's the only way to keep you safe. It's not the only way. Are you trying to get yourself killed? Get out through the alley. You know what taking away someone's powers does to them. You have seen it in their eyes. They are shells of who they were. She is your family, your species. Don't do this, Darcy. CARA: Ten seconds, move. We gotta go. I'm not leaving. Darcy. He's right. Let's get out of here. All clear inside? Where's the breakout? I lost her. Probably wouldn't have if you had gotten here in time. One of our telepaths detected a signature here not one minute ago. A few signatures actually. Are you calling me a liar? It doesn't matter what I think. You know protocol. They'll scan your brain back at HQ, find out everything you know. (CLANGING) What was that? We gotta go. Piper, run! Tell your men to stand down. Or what? Your kind can't kill. I don't need to kill in order to stop you. Put down the gun. I said put down the damn gun. Take her out. (GUNFIRE) We have to go. Now. Piper, I am so sorry. She was all I had left. I can't go home again. I have no one. You have us. Before you know it, this place will feel like home. Irene! Oh. (GROANS) I'm going to give you a legit one of these, when I'm healed. Thank you. All I did was take you to the hospital. We don't go to hospitals. You took a chance and saved my life. Anyways, gonna go pass out. You ready for this? Not really. What am I even supposed to say? Maybe just being here is enough. C'mon. ___ ___ ___ (PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) (PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES) (APPLAUSE) Someone has been a very, very bad girl. I just ran out to the bakery. Don't lie, it's unbecoming. You used your powers again. Okay, so I teleported. The bakery I like is three train steps away. I thought we had an arrangement? So this little thing of ours can work. You know, I could strip you of your powers, Morgan. Throw you into a windowless cell. I'd put a bullet through you and no one would blink an eye. Well, what's stopping you. Keep flouting the rules and you'll see how serious I am. Maybe I like to flout the rules. Morgan. Maybe you like it too. (BUTTONS CLATTERING) There you are. Yep, just been hiding. Sorry, I wasn't ready to go home. I know. I know you can hear my thoughts. You can't blame yourself. Who else is there to blame? In the end, you were right about Darcy. I misjudged her. Doesn't matter. She's still gone. I never should have forced you to go after Piper in the first place. You told me to think for myself. I did and I'm glad. You tried to reunite two lost, lonely siblings. And you risked getting caught to stay with Piper. It reminded of what I've known all along. You're the best person I've ever met. I don't know if I belong here, Cara. Why would you say that? It's like John always says, we're at war. And in war there's no room for... for whatever, sentimentality. You mean humanity? John keeps people alive. You kept Irene alive. Before we brought you in, we'd lost sight of what it is to be alive. At least I know I had. You've given us a gift. So are we going to talk about... about last night? What about it? We, um... (CLEARS THROAT) made out. Right, I'm sorry. I forgot. No, you didn't. Well I'm glad it was memorable. I worried I didn't stack up against Crystal and Cheyenne. Well, you were... um... you were pretty amazing. I think about you, Cara. I think about you too. I'm sorry. I just thought we should go someplace more private.
