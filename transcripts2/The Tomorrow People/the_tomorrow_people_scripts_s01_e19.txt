 STEPHEN:  My name is Stephen Jameson. 
 And I am one of the Tomorrow People. 
 They call our powers the three T's. 
 Telepathy... Stephen? STEPHEN:  Telekinesis... And teleportation. There is a shadow war going on between us and Ultra... No! 
 The secret organization that hunts us. The only way to keep my species from going extinct is to find my father. And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy. Previously on The Founder invented some kind of machine to amplify your father's powers. Machine for what? I don't know. But whatever it is, your father risked death to stop it. It's time to move forward. How? Oh, you know very well. Stephen? No, he's not ready. The machine. Finding The Refuge is in the best interest of both species. What do you want me to do? You are the only one who can take us there. Hey! Hey, where's your badge? It's supposed to be on display at all times. (GRUNTING) (BEEPING) 
(DOOR UNLOCKING) (BUZZING) Oh, come on, come on. (ALARM BLARING) 
(GRUNTING) FOUNDER: Last night, Dr. Jedikiah Price tried to sabotage the very organization he labored all these years to build. He assaulted two of our employees, one human, and one of our kind. No one here is safe from his deranged reprisals. I had hoped that we would all be able to forget your old superior and his brutal regime. That we could recommit to the study and protection of our kind. But he has left us with no choice. I want Dr. Price brought to me, and brought to justice! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Stephen, come into my office. (THINKING)  John, The Founder just called open season on my uncle. He could lead them straight to my dad's body. I'm on it. Listen, I just wanted to say that I realize Jedikiah's arrest might be difficult for you. Yeah, not as much as you might think. Well, nevertheless, first losing your father, and now... I'd like another chance in that machine of yours. (CHUCKLING) Well, I admire your zeal, but, if you're to do so, there's one skill that you must master, that only you can master. Stopping time. Now, as I understand, you've only stopped time at moments of emotional duress, never by will? What does that have to do with the machine? See, the machine opens a portal to a world in which only our kind can live. Stopping time allows you to pass through the threshold. If I get there, is it possible to come back? Well, why would anyone want to come back from paradise? When do we begin? You must hone all of your powers, since they're all connected. Meaning, when you strengthen one ability... You strengthen all of them. (THINKING)  I thought you said this was going to be difficult. Oh, two powers at once. That's very good. Now, try teleporting. (WHOOSHING) (GROANING) You're supposed to be training Stephen, not coddling him. Yes, sir. Keep it up. Why are you killing yourself? What is so important? Firing up this machine. You just have to trust me, okay? It's something I have to do. You don't have to burn yourself out on the first day. (CHUCKLING) Is your mom working tonight? Yeah. Where's your brother? Soccer tournament. Oh. Well, I was thinking that maybe I could come over and we could approach training from a different angle. What kind of angle? Oh, see, I was thinking that maybe we could... (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (CLEARING THROAT) Boss told me to swap you out, Agent Cole. I'm gonna kick your ass. Doesn't take much. Good luck. Hey, hey! (BREATHING NERVOUSLY) It's me. (EXHALING) 
Okay. Sorry. Heard about your break-in at Ultra. Desperate times, John. Desperate times. -Time to go. (RACKING SHOTGUN) No, no! Sorry, not leaving him. The Founder's put a bounty on your head. You want to protect your brother? You need to get as far away from him as possible. We swore that whatever happens to us, we go through it together, sorry. If Roger ever returns, you'll be the first person he thanks. Well, that's fantastic. But I just spent six years in hell. So it's gonna take a little more than an apology. All the more reason to stay here, John. You can help me guard him, I'm not leaving him. Listen to me. It is not safe. If what Stephen said is true, we need to leave now! Stephen is very confused, and he has no idea what he's saying right now, I'm not leaving. Help me. Please. Okay, chocolates. Too many candles, way too many candles. CARA: -  Stephen? Jedikiah won't leave your father's side. Ultra is hunting Jedikiah. Well, John's got a soft spot for your uncle. My uncle is manipulating him. At least now, Roger's safe. Now he's got two bodyguards. (DOORBELL RINGING) Cara, I gotta go. Uh, come on in, it's open. (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) 
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) You're early. Ah, you shouldn't have. I was just about to burn my house down. What's going on? Nice work today, Stephen. Thank you, but, uh, something tells me you're not here to pat me on the back. The, uh, Tomorrow People. John and Cara. I assume you're still in contact. The only reason I ask is I want to formalize our ceasefire. The shadow war between Ultra and all paranormals is over. Okay, uh... I'll let them know. I'd prefer to meet with them myself. Convince them of my intentions. Yeah, that would be nice, but the last time John was in Ultra, you tortured him. And John murdered your father. War is a nasty business, Stephen, and the quicker we put an end to it, the better. I'd like their answer as soon as possible. Okay. Oh, you mean now? Yes, now. And, Stephen... If I were to discover that anyone is aiding Jedikiah, helping your uncle elude capture... What? I would be supremely disappointed. The Tomorrow People US - S01E19 
Modus Vivendi The Founder can't be that interested in a peace summit if he's already making threats. He wants Jedikiah's head on a spike, who can blame him? So you're betting on the Founder? Better the devil we know. Look, as far as I'm concerned, both the Founder and Jedikiah... TIM:  Can suck it. I've been teaching him slang. (CHUCKLING) I don't trust either of them, but the Founder is the only one who can teach me how to master the machine. So he says. I think I figured out how to bring my father back. How? If I can use the machine to get into limbo... I can bring him home. Are you high? Let's just think about this for a minute. Your father was shot, we take him out of cryostasis, he still has a bullet in him. I know, I am working on that, but until we figure it out I say we play nice with the Founder. His offer still sounds too good to be true. Sorry to interrupt, but your partner has been texting you. I'm not familiar with that slang. I'm putting her messages on the screen now. No, no, no, no! No, thank you! See you guys. Uh, "can't wait to" what? Hi. I thought we had a date. Hey. Um, yeah, I'm sorry, I... It's fine if you want me to leave, I can leave. No, no, I, uh... I'm definitely... (CHUCKLING) 
I definitely don't want you to go. That would be the worst. (CELL PHONE RINGING) You gonna get that? No. (RINGING CONTINUES) You sure you don't want to get that? (LAUGHING) I'm turning my phone off. (BEEPING) Okay, it's Astrid. Uh, just one second. Uh... hey, hey! ASTRID:  Hey, where are you? I ordered double moo sho... Uh, yeah, I'm kind of, uh... busy. "Kind of busy?" Awesome. Who's that? Astrid, uh... Next time, I promise. Okay, bye. 
(PHONE BEEPING) Please, don't go. I literally got all dressed up, and... You... look... incredible. What... What is this to you? Um, what, uh, this to you? I really don't want to get messed up over something that you are just... No, it's not that. And until I figure out how to stop time, I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it. Hey, I got your message. Is everything okay? Yeah, I just, uh, over-ordered and didn't want it to go to waste. And then I ate it all, so... (SIGHING) 
I was just expecting Stephen to show. He stood you up. It's not like we had a date, but, you know, we have this standing late-night dumpling thing. Mmm, but now that he's busy with Hillary... (STAMMERING) 
Hillary? It's just, of all people to be hooking up with... (CHUCKLING) 
What? Stephen's having s*x with the Ultra agent who tried to kill me? Oh. (SCOFFING) 
How can he trust her? That's what I've been saying. What if she's trying to use him? She's certainly distracting him. Why don't you read her mind to find out what's going on? It's not that easy. I'd have to get her alone, I'd have to get her away from Ultra. Well. You know, you do have an underground hideout. Astrid, you are brilliant. Let's say I do agree to the summit with your new boss. I thought you were against it? It is the best way to test if the Founder's truce is real, right? All righty, then. Which lamb should we send to the slaughter? You. How now? Aren't you always begging to go topside? Shouldn't we send someone more expendable? I want to let the Founder know I'm willing to meet him halfway. But I am not sending my top lieutenant in without getting some collateral first. Top lieutenant? What kind of collateral? An agent he values. Okay, I'll let him know. I want Hillary. Your partner? That's not a problem, is it? Nope. I was just thinking about the last time the three of us were together. I should've known better to play paintball with you two. (LAUGHING) I'm not here to swap memories. Listen, John, there's something you need to understand. We can't let Roger get put in that machine. Why is that? Because it's a weapon, he was supposed to be its engine, that's why he left. Okay. Listen to me, John, this is very, very important, if it looks like Ultra is going to take us... We have to destroy Roger ourselves. You really have gone crazy, haven't you? First, you want me to protect him. Now, you want me to kill him all over again. Okay, it is imperative that the Founder... Would you just please be quiet. He won't get ahold of Roger, and no one's gonna die. Okay, everyone down there's pretty cool and, um, just don't be nervous. I'm not nervous. Are you nervous? No. No. You're gonna be fine. This isn't my first time behind enemy lines, you know that, right? Yeah. So how did you find a bunch of paranormal rebels anyway? I didn't, they found me. Like a lost puppy? Yeah. Cara found me, we, uh, had this connection, like, psychically. I see. 
(CLEARING THROAT) And how deep did that connection go? When I thought I was losing my mind, she showed me I wasn't. So you slept with her? Uh, what, how did... Once. That was it. Hillary, I'm sorry to do this, but, um... Really? Cara's orders. This is gonna be fun. 
(CHUCKLING) (DEVICE LOCKING) Cara. Hillary. Ready, baby? Yeah. Let's do it. Wait. Hurry back. Can I get you something to drink? Why don't you just take a look at what you really want to see? I don't know what you're talking about. Go for it. (PULSATING) Yeah. Oh. that's not what you were looking for? But my favorite part is coming up. How about that drink? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
Mr. Bathory. Ah. Where's John and Cara? Actually, um... RUSSELL: You got Kwon! Russell Kwon. Try to contain your excitement. Ah, you must be here as their emissary. I don't know what that means. Before we begin, would you like a bite of something? I hate working on an empty stomach. Beluga caviar? Yum. What's the beverage sitch? (CHUCKLING) Dr. Price wanted to neuter paranormals because he was jealous of our powers. WOMAN: (THINKING) -  Good evening, sir. 
RUSSELL: -  Hello, nurse. As you can see, I run an entirely different organization. It's Dr. Price who prevented peace between our camps. But now, with him gone, we can move forward. As we are now. Shoulder to shoulder. Refill? You read my mind, bro. To putting the past behind us. 
(GLASSES CLINKING) We will happily forget all previous indiscretions. (CHUCKLING) 
What indiscretions? Mmm. Uh, for instance, the time that you teleported into the Capital Bank. (SIGHING) 
Ancient history. Look, Founder guy, this truce sounds dope, but... (CHUCKLING) It wouldn't be the first time Ultra pulled a fast one. Of course, but I'm sure that Mr. Bathory can offer you some kind of assurances, right? I can give you my word. It's the best I can offer. Is that a rose 2014 edition? Good eye. And, as a token of my good will... Go on, it's yours. (SCOFFING) (SIGHING) Now, uh, this, uh, tracer that I've heard so much about. Oh, you mean the ticket to the Refuge? The one you've been drinking for the last hour. (SNICKERING) 
I'm only kidding. You don't really believe that I would ruin a '62 Bordeaux with electromagnetic compounds, do you? (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) I don't know, would you? (LAUGHING CONTINUES) (BOTH LAUGHING) Russell, what took you so long? Uh, give me a sec, balance is off. You're bleeding! This? Oh, no, it's red wine. (LAUGHING) Listen up, people. The Founder... is totally cool. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) And the truce offer? Legit. 
 
 The war is over. (ALL CHEERING) Okay. Okay. Okay! I understand that everyone is excited, but we are not making any decisions until John gets back. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) 
I'm guessing time didn't just stop. (FOUNDER SIGHING) (GRUNTING) You're far too green. (SIGHING) 
I'll get there. (SCOFFING) 
Perhaps. It took your father four years to even come close to mastering his abilities. I don't have four years, put me back in the machine. Stephen, the machine takes an incredible toll on your system. You try to use it fully before you're ready? It'll be the last thing you ever do. Now, again. (SIGHING) You didn't, by any chance, drop Hillary on the train tracks, did you? Jealousy is an ugly thing. Mmm-hmm. Well, I'm not going to let my guard down just because you got wined and dined by the Founder. Also got a really dope watch. I'm joking, Cara. Look, whatever the Founder is playing at, a peace offering is more than Jedikiah ever gave us. I know that you want to believe that. Do you know what I would do if this war was over? I would go home. See my mom. Hook up with Talia, fight the good fight. And maybe take down a couple of casinos along the way. But, I just... I want to make something of my life. Don't you? I don't know what to say. Say... That we can take this truce on a test drive. Tonight, Tomorrow People and Ultra, a little  soiree,  see if former adversaries can rub elbows. The last time we all went topside, Ultra agents killed three of our own. I know. I am not gonna let that happen this time. I promise. Keep it small. (RUSSELL WHOOPING) John know he's missing this? Yeah, and I wish I could join him. Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, Stephen... This is a celebration. You're dancing with me, I'll embarrass you, I don't even care. I know you will. Is this what you do at home in front of the mirror? (LAUGHING) CARA: (LAUGHING) 
Don't do that. Hey. Did you have to invite her? Everything will be fine, okay? I promise. Did you find anything out from reading her mind? Nothing I want to remember. You think this is gonna work? We found a way to make it work. So can they. Come on, buy me a drink. VERRAS: Sir. That list of properties belonging to Dr. Price's holding company. Seems like he had a thing for rundown real estate. Hmm. It seems he purchased this one six years ago. That supposed to mean something? Check it out. And, Agent Verras... Take a tactical team, will you? Okay, I gotta call it a night. I'll see you tomorrow. Why? Astrid? She's been glaring at me all night. Well, you did try and have her killed. I said I was sorry. I know, just be nice to her, okay? Okay. And I gotta be up early for training. Oh, what? Are you saying that all of this is less interesting than the Founder's machine? No, I am definitely, definitely not saying that. Mmm-hmm? All right? But it's not just some machine. It's, um... No, it's okay. Whatever it does, I know that it's really important to you. Just go. Because I'm gonna put you through the ringer tomorrow. Promise? Mmm-hmm. TAC TEAM MEMBER: On your knees! On your knees! (GRUNTING) I can't let you do that. (GRUNTING) (BOTH STRUGGLING) What is this place? (GUN COCKING) Get off him. Kill him, John. Kill him now. (YELLING) 
Are you out of your mind? (YELLING) 
What is wrong with you? JEDIKIAH: Oh, my god. All right, wait a minute. Wait, let me think. Okay, reinforcements are gonna be here any second. You gotta call Stephen and your friends, now! And destroy any chance we have of a truce? Do you have any idea what we've sacrificed... What you sacrificed? What do you think I sacrificed? I had a life! I made a promise to protect my brother! (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) All right, that's the tactical team. Call Stephen now. No. Call him now, or I swear to God, I end Roger. Jed! (BREATHING HEAVILY) (THINKING)  John, it's just me. I've brought some provisions. John? Jedikiah? No. No, no, no. No. No. Jedikiah! John! CARA: (THINKING) 
 Stephen, what's wrong? STEPHEN: 
 There's blood everywhere. My dad's body... Where's John? He's gone. He's gone, they're all gone. Well, look who the cat dragged in. What happened? An unfortunate turn of events. Seems your old chum, John, has been aiding your uncle. No wonder we haven't been able to find him. Strange bedfellows after all that's transpired between them. Where are they? Did we capture them? Well, no, that would have been fortunate, they escaped. Apparently, with a parcel. Of what? Well, Agent Verras here claims that he saw a frozen corpse. Your uncle is a desperate man, who knows what crazy schemes he's concocted, but I cannot believe that John would jeopardize the end of a brutal war for the sake of Jedikiah. Okay, I can fix this. Well, I hope so, Stephen. I really do, because otherwise, the truce is over, and I will be forced to go after John and all of his allies in a way that will make the old Ultra seem meek. Stephen. I'm sorry, we were ambushed. What happened? My dad's body, what did you do with him? John, where is he? He's here. He's here. Is he, uh... Still viable? Just barely. You son of a bitch! Get away from him! What did I just say, Stephen? We have a limited amount of time to resuscitate him and bring him back, and for that, you're gonna need me, kid. How much time do we have? Enough time to stop arguing and start working together, get me more ice, please. If you want the war to end, you gotta bring him back and kill the Founder. Don't do it for me, do it for him. What do you need? A capable nurse. Why can't you tell me what's going on, John? You need to see for yourself. Most people requiring surgical supplies also require a hospital. It's not Stephen, is it? No. John, talk to me. Look, whatever it is, it's going to be okay. You don't know that. You're right, I don't. (CHUCKLING) I guess it's just something mothers say. You ready? Dumb question. Hey. Hey, honey. What is it? Mom, I'm sorry to bring you down here like this. I don't understand. We need your help. (WHISPERING) 
Oh, my god. RUSSELL: (SLURRING) 
Come on, ladies. A little Russell glue will bond us all together. Russell, what are you doing? Hillary can't be down here. (SCOFFING) The war is over, we're all  hakuna matata  with Ultra. (CHUCKLING) 
I think you mean kumbaya. Wrong movie. Stephen. We have a situation. What the hell is... Wait, is that... Yeah. John, I need more light. Yes, ma'am. What can I do? I need everything on this list. Astrid? Marla? Oh, great, Jedikiah's back, that makes sense. Let me know when you're done prepping so I can start, okay? You can start? Well, I'm a PhD in Genetics. I've studied with the best doctors in the world, How many surgeries have you performed? 'Cause I've assisted on hundreds, so if we're done comparing CVs, I need you to put this on because we need to get this bullet out before his body temperature normalizes. Copy that. But your dad... I thought that you... I know. It's complicated, okay? I didn't mean to drag you into this, you shouldn't even be here. Stephen? We are not doing that! What's wrong? - Nothing, Marla hasn't started the surgery yet. But I think your father's been under too long. Even if your mother and I can resuscitate his body, I think you may have to guide him back. It is too dangerous. He wants to kill you again so you can get your dad. I'm sorry, kill who? Okay, there's another way. I need to get into the machine at Ultra. Look, if you power that up, everything your father worked to stop could come to pass. Stephen. I'm begging you. I can do this. Jameson! I want to help. No. No, I can't put you in danger. I can't risk losing you. Hillary, this isn't your fight. Yes, it is. (BUZZING) (STEPHEN GRUNTING) 
(CIRCUITS FRYING) Okay. Are you sure you know what you're doing? No. But if anyone comes through that door, you get the hell out of here, okay? Okay. (EXHALING) (MACHINE POWERING UP) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GROANING) Dad? Stephen. Stay back, something's wrong. Dad, what is this place? Don't you recognize our home? I said stay back. (GROANING) No, I need to bring you back now. We had to pull you out... Stop. (GROANING) 
Out of cryostasis. You only have a few minutes. Wait... Okay, I'm cutting. (GROANS) (ALARM BLARING) What's happening? A door shorted out. I just called maintenance. No, I'll handle this. Meet me there. Dad, come on. You gotta come with me. I know this feels like home... (STRAINING) 
But it's not, okay? Come with me. You need to let me go. No. Come on. Get up. (SCREAMING) 
What? What? (GASPING) 
I don't know. Did you nick a blood vessel? No. His core temperature is changing too quickly. Well, there's a lot of blood there, Marla. Dad. 
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY) Stephen. Come on. Come on. (GRUNTING) Epi and atropine. (GROANING) 
No! No! (EKG FLATLINING) No, Dad! 
(GROANING) (RUMBLING) Get up. Come on! 
(LABORED BREATHING) Dad! My body's not ready, I can't. Dad! What about Mom? What about Luca? What about me? Okay? Now, get up! Come on. I'm bringing you home. Are you okay? We gotta move. What happened? Did it work? I don't know. Mom. Bullet's out. Bleeding's under control. What happened to you? I'm fine. His body's ready for him. Come on, Dad. Come on. (EKG BEEPING) Is that... (BEEPING CONTINUES) 
It's a heartbeat. It's faint, but it's a heartbeat! (CHUCKLING) You okay? (SCOFFING) I should be asking you the same question after everything you've been through. I'm good. Just, um... Hoping, you know? Thank you. Had to be done. You're risking your life, going against the Founder. You know that, right? So is everybody else here. They believe in you. And your dad. So do I. (BEEPING CONTINUES) JEDIKIAH: You can breathe again. Yeah, it looks like he's out of the woods. It's only a matter of time before he opens his eyes. I just can't get my head around it. Hmm. Well, get your head around this, Roger's alive. You're absolved, kid. How does that make you feel? I don't know. I mean... If he opens his eyes and walks out of here... You might forgive me? We'll see. How is he? (CHUCKLING) Well, for a guy who's spent the last six years in a block of ice with a bullet in his chest... I'd say he's doing pretty well. I just never dreamed this day would come. I know. 
(BREATHING DEEPLY) I told you he was coming back. You were right, his father's alive. Right on time. And you're sure Stephen has no idea he's got a bit in his mouth? That he's been led exactly where we want him? None. Well done. I'll let you know when it's time for our next move.
