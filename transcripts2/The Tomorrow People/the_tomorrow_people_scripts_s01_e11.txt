 My name is Stephen Jameson. 
 I'm one of the Tomorrow People. 
 They call our powers the three T's. 
 Telepathy... 
 CARA: Stephen? 
 STEPHEN: Telekinesis...  
 And teleportation. There is a shadow war going on between us and Ultra... No! 
-... the secret organization that hunts us. The only way to keep my species from going extinct  is to find my father. And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy. STEPHEN: Previously on The Tomorrow People...  I don't know what to tell you. How about the truth? That I'm a killer? I'm going to convene a council. Tell everyone the truth. You're just an Ultra freak who can kill. Until we find Roger, you're stuck with me. My leadership... MIKE: Well, well, well. Looks like we have a new leader. CARA: First day on the job, I lead us straight into an ambush. STEPHEN: You broke into the Citadel. You saved Charlotte's life. That girl has a future now, thanks to you. Nifty trick. You could show it to me back at headquarters. Are you the police? Something like that. She's on the move. She's on the move. (GASPS) Who? What's going on? WOMAN: Take it easy. We're your friends. You just don't know it yet. My name is Nelly. I told you. She's one of us. My name's Julian. Wanna learn some magic? (CELL PHONE CHIMES) Oh. Looks like Mom is working an extra shift. We're on our own for food. I thought she had plans with Peter? Nah. No, the silver fox is out of town. Peter? Wha... You didn't tell her about Mom's new man? Your Mom is dating? She's not dating... We don't know how serious it is yet. All we know is that Stephen seriously hates him. (GRUNTS) You finished? Good. Get out. Leave the board. Ugh. Whatever. I'm ordering hoagies. Hey, it can't be easy seeing your mom mingle. It's not just that. There was something weird. I was trying to read his mind and he did this thing where he pushed me out of his head. So, he's like you. Yeah and if he was able to do that, he's pretty powerful. Maybe it's a good thing. Give you something to bond over. (CHUCKLES) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Study time's over Stephen. How'd you know I was... Just get into the office ASAP. (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Astrid. I gotta go. What about our test? I will give you a shout as soon as I'm done. And we're running low on food. I need you to organize an afterhours grocery run because Russell only brings back junk food. Are you calling me fat? I'm calling you lazy. You're supposed to be running TK drills with the newbies, we talked about this. What do you think I've been doing all day? You don't want to fry their tender young brains, do you? That is exactly what Ultra will do when they get caught, because you didn't train them properly. All right gang. TK taskmaster has spoken. Off your asses. (SIGHS) Let's beat each other up some more. TIM: Pawn to E4. Your move. Pawn to C5. TIM: A rather banal opening gambit. Do you mind shutting him off? My pleasure. TIM: But I'm only 47 moves away from (SLOWING DOWN) victory...  What's up? Ever since our botched mission to the Citadel, they've lost confidence in me. It's like I'm talking and no one is listening. You saved Charlotte from being Ultra's guinea pig. That's a win you should feel good about. As long as you don't doubt yourself, everyone else will eventually fall in line. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) (FAINT SCREAMING) CARA: What's wrong with her? I don't know, she won't answer. She's having a nightmare. Same thing happened to me when I was breaking out. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING GETS LOUDER) Charlotte, come on. Let's just hope that Ultra can't pick up on telepathic panic attacks, too. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING FADES OUT)- (GASPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. I got you. It's okay, I got you. I got you. Every time I close my eyes, it feels like I'm back at that place. You're safe now. Okay. You're safe. Is there anything we can do for her? Uh, kids aren't really my specialty. I can't imagine what she went through. We don't have to imagine it. C'mon kiddo. Let's get you something to eat. (SIGHS) Talk about a rough childhood. Being experimented on by Ultra. STEPHEN: We're doing this to our own agents now? What do you think she did? Must have really stepped in it to get the needle. Your young colleague didn't make the cut. She didn't have the right stuff to continue along our agent track, so... let's just let this rather unpleasant situation be an object lesson, shall we? Your powers are a privilege, not a right. And if we didn't need your kind for certain functions, I would gladly de-power all of you. Now that said, you three did make the cut. So congratulations on that. But the winnowing process continues. We haven't finished separating the wheat from the chaff. So how many of us get to keep our powers and become Ultra agents? And how many get chemically castrated? And how exactly are we being evaluated? By not screwing up. By not losing breakouts. By holding your hand over the candle until it burns you to the bone, if that's what I ask. For example, Julian Masters. Anybody know that name? Breakout. From five years ago. He was never caught. Presumed to have left the country. Sir. Well done. Well, he's back. Get on it. What can you tell us about him? What's his M.O.? Other than looking to recruit young and impressionable paranormals to his criminal gang? You want us to be the bait? I want you to do whatever it takes. Prove to me that you belong here. Hi. Hello. Do I know you? JULIAN: No. But we know you, Andrew. We know you're one of society's elite, who likes to flaunt his money but thinks very little of everybody else. How did you... Magic. What is this? This a reckoning, my friend. Now give me your wallet. Take everything. Just let me go. Please. Oh, we're going to take everything. And then some. (GASPING) (CHOKING) (GASPING IN PANIC) (GRUNTING) (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) Oh! Sweet music! We'll just let ourselves in, if you don't mind. Ultra's on alert because this guy Julian doesn't even try to hide his powers. Victim stories are consistent. He tortures them until he himself basically collapses. Sounds like this guy is riding the edge of the prime barrier. Even though our kind can't kill. Julian pushes the envelope as far as he can. Like he gets off on it or something. Damn, what a sicko. Yeah, well, local cops are starting to get suspicious. Sounds like Ultra's got it covered. Look, Cara, besides it being the right thing to do, if I bring this guy in, it solidifies my spot in the trainee program. Didn't realize Ultra had its own Triwizard Tournament. Hmm. Funny. But if you don't make the cut, they strip you of your powers. You're his nephew, Stephen. You'll have to find some other way to prove yourself. Julian is a nihilist. An anarchist. He doesn't care about exposure. We do. And you know this guy? Our paths crossed when I first got to town. He and his girlfriend. He wasn't exactly my style. RUSSELL: Well maybe it's worth chatting with your old pal? At least see what he's doing back in town. We didn't part on the best terms. So we have inside info on this guy and we are doing nothing. We're not doing nothing. We're monitoring. Through you. Right, because that strategy worked so well with Killian McCrane. We're not the paranormal police, Stephen. What do you think, John? Is that your call too? It's not my call. It's Cara's. But if Julian could be convinced to crawl back to where he came from, it could save us a lot of trouble. Fine. Don't say I didn't warn you. These pants are really tight. (CHUCKLES) They're supposed to be tight. You look insanely great. Good, you shrugged off the wet street rat look. That's step one. I didn't know it was a process. Step two. The men in suits who were chasing you, that's Ultra. They hunt people like us. Don't scare her, Julian. You convinced me to bring in your little pet. If she's gonna do what we do, she needs to know these things. And that she can't just be a pretty face. What is it you do? I don't understand. We're a superior species but we're hunted like rats. We should be batting them around like play toys. What do you mean? We'll show you. But first... you need to practice using your powers. Build up your strength and skill. We start by toughening you up. Helping you find the killer inside you. Julian. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) The world is divided into predators and prey. (CHOKING) Which one are you, Cara? Julian. Stop. Stop. (GASPING) Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Good. Your turn. Don't know if it's in you? Walk into Ultra right now and surrender your powers. Best case scenario. That's all you'll lose. Worst case. They'll kill you, or cook your brain. You stick with us, we'll teach you how to survive. And then... we'll teach you to live. How do you know Julian's going to show? I sent up a psychic signal flare. If he's anywhere on the island, he heard it. JULIAN: Cara Coburn. What a pleasure. Julian. I see you're still affecting Nelly's style. And her attitude. Pale imitation. You're still the same old Cara. We're here to warn you. You're on Ultra's radar and local police, I suggest you disappear. Now. Thanks, but I just got back. Ultra is more powerful than when you left Julian. As am I. Ooh. So it's leave or you give me the boot? Who's going to make me? You and your formidable new gang? I've heard about your sorry existence. Lives spent stuck underground. You all look vitamin-deficient. Have some fun. Soak up the sun. Who is this guy? Acting like he owns the town. I do own it. Say the word, Cara, and I will drop this punk like a bag of dirt. What'll it be, Julian? Like you have the right to speak to me. Let alone look me in the eye. Let's just try and keep it civil. We are not at war with the SAPs. We are trying to coexist. Humans took everything from me. You remember? You were there. We do not torture people. It doesn't serve anyone's interest. They actually follow you? These two puppies? Do they realize what a jelly-spined, ineffectual skank they've thrown in with? (CHUCKLES) Amazing that you're still alive. As weak and pathetic as you were back in the day... That's it. Ass-kicking time. He's not worth it. That's right. I'm not going anywhere. New York is mine, bitch. Remember, the name of the game is Pin Your Opponent. On the count of three, you will use your grappling and fighting skills to make that happen. Understood? Hope you had a hearty breakfast. You are my breakfast, dickhead. Ooh, such big words from such a tiny girl. One, two, three. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait! What? Are you okay? (GRUNTS) (GROANS) This round belongs to Hillary. Yeah, thanks. That guy's posse'd up, huh? Where'd Julian find all those breakouts? Those guys look prison hard. I'm sure Julian scoured the planet for sadistic scum just like him. So what's the plan, boss? Don't call me boss. We lay low. Now that we know that Julian has a psycho army, we just have to wait. Wait until when? Thanks to his recklessness, Ultra will catch up with him. We don't have the numbers to take him on. We should keep tabs on him. Just in case he decides to come after us first. Who do you want to tail him? I will. Uh, maybe you should stay with the troops. I'll go. I'll be like a piece of gum on the wall. Any developments you report back. And don't engage him. And Russell... be careful. I'll be right back, ladies. Just gonna find the safe. Okay. Come on. Are you sure this is okay? Yeah Julian says people like this are always insured, over-insured. (DOOR OPENING) So when we take their stuff, they're actually making money. Hello? I'll handle this. Let's just go. We're not done. MAN: Someone here? No talking. I know there's someone in the house. Hey. I'm calling the police. Drop the phone. (GRUNTING) Nelly! Tie him up. Help me. Cara, help me. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) (CHARLOTTE SCREAMING) Charlotte. Charlotte! It's me! Open your eyes, it's only a dream. Wherever you are, it's not real just come back to me. Follow my voice. It's not real. You're safe here, no one can hurt you. What happened? JOHN: It's okay. (DEEP BREATHING) You're okay. Charlotte. Her attacks are starting to attack everyone around her. It's only getting worse. With all they've been through recently, people are starting to talk. About what? About kicking her out of the lair. I didn't say I was for it. Because that's what they do here now? Kick the weak from the herd. Look maybe the group is just starting to feel a little unsettled. You know, being under new leadership and all. Hey, look, we all feel sorry for the kid. So what, we just put her back on the street? Let Ultra snatch her up again? Is that what you guys want? Chloe's first month, she screamed in her sleep. And before we trained him, Dunbar's telekinesis was like a firehose. If we kicked out everyone who showed up with bruises, this place would be empty. Charlotte stays. Then who's going to babysit her? I will. May I present to you, the residences of Central Park West. Seventy-three of the city's premiere luxury apartments, and home to four hedge fund managers, seven CEOs, 14 independently wealthy families. In other words, "human garbage." Just like the b*st*rd who used to live here. But he got his and they will too. So... Who'd like to go on a shopping trip with me? ALL: Yeah. The little piggies are picking up the tab. (ALL CHEERING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) Okay, this is good. That's not good, this isn't going to work, I'm going to be thrown out, I'm going to have to live on the street. You are not going to be thrown out, okay? I'm trying to do what you said. I'm concentrating on my breathing. No, you're learning to concentrate on your breathing. Once you master it, you'll be able to... you'll be able to take all that anger, frustration, confusion, and turn it into something good. How do you know all of this? Well, I was taken by Ultra when I was your age. Maybe even younger. It seems like you turned out okay. Well... only after I was able to take my fear of them, what I thought was my greatest weakness, and turn it into something powerful. How? By taking all the darkness that's trapped inside you, and using it as a weapon. Close your eyes, Charlotte. Close your eyes. All those horrible memories are like clouds passing through your mind. And the cloud that's about Ultra is black. And it blocks out the sun. But now imagine that you reach out with one hand. You take that black cloud and... (GRUNTS) Destroy it. Destroy it. 
 
 This is the place Julian was targeting his next attack. Which apartment? All of them. He's calling it a shopping trip. Sounds like B&E. It's not the loot they're after. Julian will terrify and torture anyone he can get his hands on. What's this guy got against humans? He thinks they're weak. That our kind is superior. Julian can't kill so he figures beat them half to death and then scare them the rest of the way. If we can get a suppression cup on him, I'm betting the rest of his mutts will scatter. And if they don't? I don't want any of our people compromised. I'm not talking about everyone, I'm talking about me. Russell, it was a recon mission. I'm passing this off to Stephen, let Ultra deal with them. You got it... Chief. What? Didn't call you "boss". Stephen, I got a head's up on Julian's next move. Don't take any chances with him. You need to take him out and deliver him to Ultra before the rest of his crew realizes. No way he's more dangerous than my sparring partner. (GRUNTING) AGENT: Stephen. Coming. You don't know Julian like I do. (GROANS) Make sure she doesn't move an inch. We'll be right back. Check in here. Please. You have to let me go. I have a heart condition. I feel weak. Please. Untie... Be quiet! If you let me go, I swear to God, I'll go. I'll never look back. I said be quiet. He's gonna kill me. You know that. Please. Just go now. (PANTING) Thank you. Where did he go? I don't know. It happened so fast, he just slipped out of the bindings and he took off. Listen, don't tell Julian what happened. Nelly! (SHOTGUN COCKING) No! (SCREAMING) (THUDDING) Nelly? Nelly! WOMAN ON RADIO: Make sure you do a full sweep  of the remaining floors of the west corridor. And radio in once you've completed. SECURITY GUARD: Roger that... Electrical hub for the entire building is this way. Let's shut out the lights and get this party started. (EXHALES) What are you doing? I followed you here. You need to get better at checking your tails. (METAL CLANGING) Walk away. Now. What the hell was that? I saw my chance with Julian, so I took it. No, we're supposed to be a team here, right, Hillary? So why can't we help each other succeed? You actually buy that crap? I don't want to see anyone else strapped to a table. It must be really easy for you to be sympathetic. You're the only one who doesn't have to worry. (THINKING) Cara. What happened? We blew it. Julian got away. CARA: Russell, get out of there. (THINKING) On my way. I thought I smelled a rat. Did Cara send you to spy on me? No, I was looking for the Sparkles Jones Club and... Clearly, this ain't it. So... Before I send you back to your whole in the ground, I have a message I'd like you to pass on for me. Huh. (GRUNTS) You shouldn't have done that. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) Okay. (GROANING) (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) I'm almost... Why? (SCREECHING STOPS) (MOANS) (LAUGHING) I've never felt so alive. (PANTING) Who wants to go next? (RUSSELL GRUNTING) What... what happened? Julian found him, worked him over pretty good. Left him on a subway train for us to find. Don't just stand there, help us. (RUSSELL GROANING) CARA: Russell, can you hear me? We're going to take care of you, okay? I never should have let him go by himself to spy on Julian. You did what you had to do. I may not be able to kill but, I swear to God, I'm going to make that b*st*rd wish he were dead. Nelly? Nelly! Nelly! (NELLY MOANING) (WHIMPERING) What happened? I'm sorry, I didn't... Hold on. Hold on. What did you do? No, no, no, no! (SOBBING) You were weak. Now she's dead because of you. (YELPING) (GASPING) (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) If only I could kill you! (GROANS) (SCREECHING STOPS) (GASPING) Ultra will find you in a week. Lock you up. Strip you of your powers. You will die human, Cara. That's what you deserve. How is he? As far as I can tell, he's stable. He was mumbling something about boxcars and snake eyes. (CHUCKLING) Unconscious and he's still throwin' dice. Always a good sign. CARA: Julian did this to send me a message. Thinks he can scare me, but it's time to end this. Hey, Cara, you said from the start he was too dangerous. Doesn't this just prove that you were right? I'm not gonna risk any more of my team. Why not risk mine? A bunch of Ultra trainees? Well, this one girl, Hillary, is actually pretty damn cutthroat. She kind of reminds me of you. I appreciate the offer, but I need to handle this on my own. Wait. Cara. Think about it. The whole reason he sent you this message is because he wants you to come at him head-on. You're playing right into Julian's strength. CARA: You're right. And he's gonna play right into mine. Which is what? The fact that Julian doesn't think I have one. (KNOCKING) Julian! JULIAN: Quite an entrance. I take it you received my message. And I brought my response. (JULIAN CHUCKLING) These losers? I see you had to bring your B-Team. Unless, of course, I'm missing some sort of secret weapon? Look at you. Playing the warrior queen. Although, instead of fighting, you could always join me. Think about it. My strength, and your... whatever. We could rule this city. Never. I can't say I'm surprised at your response. I know who you really are. You're the same pathetic little girl who dined on stolen junk food. I'm not that person anymore. I'm not scared of you. You should be. I'm not the same person either. Thanks to you. You gave me my first taste of a secret drug. I've shared it with all my friends. Isn't that right? (ALL AGREEING) But you... you can't appreciate it. You don't know what you're missing. I've never felt such a rush, or so alive, as when I was pounding your friend's face in. Same old Cara. (CARA YELLING) Let's make some music. No! (LAUGHING) They're scared! (CARA GRUNTING) Leave her! She's mine. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Looks like you're right back where you started. Alone. I'm not alone. (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) What the hell? STEPHEN: Ray, call it in. We're gonna need a wagon. Cuff 'em. If they try and run, tranq 'em. But I want Julian. It's locked down. I can't jump. (GRUNTING) Whatever that girl did, it must have disrupted our powers. We need more time. There is no time. Stephen! I got 'em! (WHOOSHING) Julian! It's over. WOMAN: No! I'm sorry, darling. (PULSATING) No! Julian! (STEPHEN GRUNTING) Damn it. (GRUNTING) Get up. (ALL CLAPPING) Charlotte, I totally underestimated you. Does this mean I get to stay? Of course you can stay, honey. Come on. All right, Charlotte. Good job, Char. So, your plan was kind of genius? Where they saw weakness, I saw her strength. Thank you for helping with her. I'm here whenever you need me. I heard from Stephen. Julian got away. Doubt he'll forgive and forget. You stood up to him and won. That's what he won't forget. He'll come back for me. We'll always have to live with a guard up. How's that different from how we live now? That's leadership during wartime. There is no end. This fun just goes on and on. You gave these guys the confidence to stand up to someone like Julian. You gave them something that I took away. Hope. How did you figure it all out? Trial and error. Mostly error. Hey. What the hell? (WEAKLY) You guys are getting the party on without me? Hey, hey. All right. Take it easy. No, it's okay. I'm gonna take a victory... lap, 'cause I beat the plums off that Julian. Okay. All right. (GROANING) Did he beat the plums off of me? I'm on a leash... JEDIKIAH: Very impressive, Stephen. Very impressive. It'd be more so if you'd got Julian, but... I'll take this for today. Well done. STEPHEN: Actually, it was a team effort. Really? Well, just for the sake of argument, why don't you rate the participation of your team? You know... I couldn't if I tried. We all shared equally. (CLAPPING) An improbable, three-way tie. I guess you're all winners. Well done. But understand, only the best of the best are gonna move forward. Don't you think it's better to weed out the weak now, before more lives are lost? I am so conditioned to root out an exploitable weakness. That's not you. You're just... decent. We can survive this. All of us. But only as a team. Well, if that's the case, thank you for letting me be a part of it. Got a reprieve from my uncle. So, go team. And we made it through the day. I guess I should be happy. Cara, it's over, okay? Whatever hold Julian had on you... It's gone. It was his girlfriend. Nelly. Only person he ever cared about. She was my first friend that was like us. She got shot. Julian said it was because I was weak. No. Julian exploited you. Okay? He tried to control you through fear and hate. Yeah, that's what I tell myself. Somehow, it doesn't quite sink in. Cara, think about what happens if Julian finds someone like Charlotte. Okay? But you... (CARA LAUGHING) Are you gonna try and give me another pep talk? You bet. Well, John already beat you to it, so... It's sweet, though. I guess we both care about you. I am going to go check on Russell. If I am such a great leader, why can't I get them figured out? TIM: Perhaps you enjoy the thrill of being pursued simultaneously by two equally desirable mates. It was rhetorical, Tim. Right. Sorry. I'll be quiet. Hey! Where've you been? Tried calling you last night. I know. I was out. I'm sorry. I take it that, wherever you were, you were not studying for Calculus. No. But it's cool. You think summer school is cool? Well, you're not failing Calculus, which means I'm not failing Calculus either. Don't even think about it. You don't get to cheat off my mind. No, Astrid. I would never. I am not okay with this. And we're late. I hate you. Really? 'Cause I thought you loved me. Okay, okay... I'm just... (LAUGHING) Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. I'm just like you. My name's Julian. Hey, you wanna learn some magic? Come on.
