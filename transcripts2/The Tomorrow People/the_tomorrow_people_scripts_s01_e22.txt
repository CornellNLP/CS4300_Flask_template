 CARA: Previously on The Tomorrow People...  
 It's only a matter of time before the Founder finds out I'm back. 
 You're gonna run? 
 If he forces me into that machine, those people inside are all in danger. 
 The Founder wants to use the Machine to kill every man, woman and child on the planet. 
 Every human. 
 We can't let the Founder turn us into killers. 
 We're killers either way, Roger. 
 Don't do this. 
 I'm sorry, Roger. 
 We brought your guy. 
 Hello Roger. Seems like your sewer rats weren't as loyal as you'd hoped. 
 Russell, Natalie, and a few of the others. 
 They took your father into Ultra. 
 ASTRID: Why aren't you helping Stephen? 
 He's gonna get himself killed. Breaking into Ultra alone. 
 He's not alone. 
 What do you mean? 
 Why else would Jedikiah take Irene's powers? 
 To use them against the Founder. 
 According to Irene, the human body will eventually reject our powers. 
 The only question is when? 
 ULTRA GUARD 1: Hold it right there! 
 (GRUNTING) 
 ULTRA GUARD 2: Put 'em up! 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 Roger! 
 No! Stay back. 
 No, no, I have to get you out of here. 
 Stop! 
 Come any closer and you're gonna be the first to die. 
 You're human. 
 I know. 
 I finally had powers of my own but they failed me. 
 I'm sorry I failed you. 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) Don't worry, you can still stop it. 
 No. I'm not going to kill you, Roger. 
 Run the numbers. It's me or every human that you love. 
 What about your... your child? 
 How do you know your unborn isn't a human? 
 Think of the life you and Morgan can have, do it for them. 
 Come on. 
 (YELLING) Do it, Jedikiah! 
 Do it for me. 
 Please. 
 Do it for me. 
 (ROGER GASPING) 
 Argh! 
 Dad. 
 (ROGER WHIMPERING) 
 (GASPING) 
 It's wrong, no... 
 (GROANING) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 It's ok. 
 (WHEEZING) 
 (WEAKLY) It's ok. Everything's going to be ok. 
 (MILD SOBBING) 
 The Machine. 
 Why is it still charging? 
 It's already got what it needs from you, Roger. 
 Your powers. 
 This will be your legacy, Roger. 
 Long after you've gone, your powers will live on. 
 Growing, expanding. 
 Transforming the planet. 
 (GASPING) 
 And there's nothing you can do to stop it, Stephen. 
 Don't listen to him. It's over for me. 
 But you can do this. 
 You can save them, you can save humankind. 
 (VOICE BREAKING) No, I'm not leaving you. 
 Look at me. 
 There's strength in you, son. 
 Strength you can't imagine. 
 Son, I believe in you. 
 You have to go. 
 (SNIFFLING AND BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Roger. 
 No such escape for you, Jedikiah. 
 Finish them. 
 (WHISPERING) Hold on tight. 
 Why didn't you teleport us to a hospital, Roger? 
 I could have saved you. 
 (MEEKLY) I'm sorry. It's all my fault. 
 No. 
 I knew our species couldn't exist together. 
 And it's my fault. 
 (GASPING IN PAIN) Unless, Stephen can... 
 Unite us. 
 I like imagining that. 
 (CONTINUES GASPING) 
 (SOFTLY) Roger. 
 (GASPING STOPS) 
 Roger. 
 Roger. (SOFT SOBBING) 
 Stephen. 
 Hey, what happened? 
 You ok? 
 Where's Jedikiah? 
 My father's dead, Jedikiah killed him. 
 My God. 
 (SNIFFLING) 
 Stephen, I am so sorry. 
 I couldn't save him. 
 (VOICE BREAKING) I... I can stop time but I couldn't save him. 
 I was too late. 
 My uncle shot him. He, uh... thought maybe it would stop the Machine. 
 He was too... too late, too. 
 What are you doing? You know paranormals can't kill. 
 He can. 
 I'm not even one of you anymore. 
 You were Annex, John. Why can't I be? 
 A killer? 
 You think... you think that's what your dad would've wanted? 
 None of this is what he wanted! 
 John? Where's the facility? 
 Where were you weaponized? 
 (CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY) 
 We're not letting you do this. 
 You already did. 
 Hey. 
 I'm sorry, Astrid. 
 Stephen. 
 Killing the Founder won't stop the Machine. 
 It won't save them. 
 I know. 
 Then why are you doing this? 
 Revenge. 
 The Machine is akin to a nuclear reactor. 
 Only its fuel is paranormal energy, Roger's. 
 Any idea of the affected radius once the Machine goes nuclear? 
 TIM: Theoretically. 
 If I were human which, thank God, I'm not, I'd get as far away from the Machine as humanly possible. 
 Thanks, Tim. 
 You heard him, John. 
 You want me to run? 
 I don't want you to die. 
 And that is exactly what will happen if you stay here. 
 You have to get as far from the city as you can. 
 How? It's not like I can teleport. 
 No passport, no car. 
 What am I supposed to do? Hitchhike? 
 It's like the whole world got turned upside down. 
 Now humans are the endangered species. 
 And I'm one of them. 
 What happened to us, Cara? 
 What happened? 
 I used to, I... 
 I used to be able to hear your thoughts. 
 Now, it's just... it's just silence. 
 Feels empty. 
 We are going to survive this. 
 Together. 
 I will find a way to stop the Founder and then I will find you. 
 I promise. 
 And if you can't? 
 If you won't save yourself... will you at least try and save Astrid? 
 (SNIFFLING) 
 Look, if this is about the Ducati, no one saw me teleport it, bro. 
 Oh, and, uh, that thing that happened in the VIP room. 
 Who's gonna believe a bunch of coked-out strippers. Right? 
 You think this is about the humans? 
 This is about the Tomorrow People. Bro. 
 Ah, Russell. Thanks for coming. 
 What are you doing here? 
 They dragged me in here, same as you. 
 Welcome, Russell, welcome. This will only take a moment. 
 Cara Coburn. 
 Yeah, what about her? 
 Well, I would like the two of you to retrieve her from the Lair. 
 That is what you call your secret, little hovel, isn't it? 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Look, uh, we already brought you Stephen's dad. 
 That was the deal. 
 There are two million people on this island, Russell. 
 And tomorrow... it will all be ours. 
 And if you want to be a part of that world. 
 Then you will bring me your former leader. 
 And those loyal to her. 
 You mean Stephen? 
 What are you going to do to them? 
 "Do to them?" 
 Your friends will inherit this brand new world right alongside us. 
 But, of course. 
 If they interfere with us, at this late hour Why, then, Roger's sacrifice will have been for nothing. 
 JEDIKIAH: (IN FILM) Hello, John. What are you doing here? 
 YOUNG JOHN: Just practicing my telekinesis, sir. 
 JEDIKIAH: (IN FILM) Ok, what did I tell you? It's Jed. 
 Why don't you just call it a day, kiddo? 
 YOUNG JOHN: What's up with the camera? 
 JEDIKIAH: (IN FILM) Happy Birthday. 
 ALL: (IN FILM) Happy Birthday! 
 YOUNG JOHN: Thank you, guys. You remember that day? You remember the present I got you? Of course I remember. Well, what you don't know is that, that knife belonged to my granddad. And my granddad gave it to my father and my father gave it to me. And, um... It would sound silly but I wanted to keep it in the family. YOUNG JOHN: It's cool. Thank you. This one. You kept it. Yeah. Well, you know, superstitions says it's bad luck to give a knife as a present. Severs relationships. Well, here then. I'm giving it back. Maybe it'll take back some of the bad luck. I wish I could take back what I did to you, John. It was for nothing. Now, my brother's gone and the world's gone to hell. And here you are, watching old movies. Yes, indeed. You're, uh... you're all I have left. You're... Human. I'm just a man, now, Jed. (SOFTLY) You're "just a man"? John. That is all a father could want for his son. I'm sorry, all visitors are supposed to che... Ugh! Delephonium-6, the drug you used to Annex people, where is it? This was manufactured this month. Why? The Annex Project was shut down years ago. (STAMMERING) I just make the stuff. I don't know why he needed it. Who? I never caught his real name. (SIGHING) He called himself... The Founder. Alright, we're almost there. Get ready to pull the cord. RUSSELL: (THINKING) You really think we can trust these goons? I said, stop the train! Humans gotta hoof it down to the Lair. Who you calling "human"? (THINKING) And who are you calling a "goon"? A paranormal kill squad? What the hell did the Founder do? NATALIE: Cara? It's me. Russell and I made a huge mistake. How dare you come back here. Roger's blood is on your hands. So? RUSSELL: No! What are you doing?  Murder was not part of the deal. Cara, wait... You're on your own now, Russell. You're my world. You're my reason for being and I'm humbled... To be back in this home. Let's all raise our glasses. Here's to family. (SNIFFLING) Don't try to stop me, Cara. I won't. What happened to you? Natalie lead a team of agents down to the Lair. Only they've been mutated with the same recombinant gene therapy you're about to take. His agents can kill. I have to do this, Cara. The Founder took my family, my father, Hillary, he took everything from me! I'm still here. If we don't stop him, John, Astrid, Luca, they're all dead. I believe in you, Stephen. I have from the very start. The first time I heard your voice. I knew. Knew what? That you'd be the one to save all of us. How? It's not like this. Not by giving up your humanity. Come on. It's not safe here. Hey. Swung by the café. Saw that it was closed. My parents are on a cruise. It's their 25th, so they're probably sipping champagne and watching the sun set. Yeah. Maybe it's best, they don't know. That the world's gonna end? Well, our world at least. Yeah. Who would've thought it would happen on a Tuesday? But I'm glad you called. I didn't want to be alone when it happened. Me neither. But this isn't where we belong. Come on. I didn't know if there was some kind of secret knock or something. Didn't think you'd come. And let you steal all the glory? Of course, we came, dorkus. Not my fault. She didn't want to run. Look, we don't have much time. According to Jedikiah, the Machine goes nuclear in two hours. Sorry, what does that mean? For them, nothing. For us... Time stops for each and every human. It doesn't start again. Great. Then we better get moving. Anyone got a plan? STEPHEN: You son of a bitch! (RUSSELL GRUNTING) I didn't know your father would end up... I thought we were all going to die. We screwed up. I'm sorry. CARA: Stephen, Russell saved my life. He helped me escape when the Founder sent in his Annex agents. This doesn't make us even. RUSSELL: I know. I'll never make it right. But I can help stop the Machine. How? Roger had a plan. Before we sold him out. A way of taking the Founder down. Then again, it was designed for a dozen of us, not three. Three? Yeah, you know, there are five of us here. I just thought... You just thought what? 'Cause we don't have powers, we can't fight? We're the ones fighting for our lives. Russell, we're listening. Founder's going to put every goon he's got on the Machine. Yeah. No surprise, we're coming. But he's expecting us to teleport in. Stealth mode, right? Right, so if we're not sneaking in... We're storming the castle. Head on. Full frontal assault. We draw the Founder's agents outside Ultra. Distracting them. While someone sneaks in the Machine room. And destroys it. You? You had your shot. My turn now. Ok. Practical question. If we're going to attack and office building in broad daylight, don't you think someone's going to see us? Like cops? Same cops will be dead in two hours. Yeah. Along with me, and John, and every human that's caught in the blast. I'm not going to let that happen. Neither am I. Ok, who's up for saving the world? It looks like Ultra's cordoned off the block to keep out any unwanted guests. Man, our ass is going to be hanging out in the breeze. Not having second thoughts, are you? (CHUCKLING) Nah, I got a great ass. No matter what happens... I stay put until you guys draw their fire. Right. You know what, I'm going to go do some pre-fight calisthenics. Don't really know what to say. Good luck. 
 
 Where are they? Fire! (GRUNTING) Ahh! I don't think so. (YELPING) There's another one. (YELPING) NATALIE: I'll take care of them. No. They're coming to us. Hey, hey, hey. You want to make a scene? The operations room's that way. Alright. I got it. Uh, are you sure? Yeah. Split up, maximum chaos. That's the title of my memoir. Ah, Cara. I'd knew you'd find your way here eventually. The Founder has offered us the world and you want to just hand it back to the humans? Look. (EXHALING) I've made some major mistakes in my life, but mass extinction? That's where I draw the line. Well, you can't stop it, Russell. I won't let you. I do hope you've said your goodbyes to John. Made your final peace. (GRUNTING) Is that what you told Cassie? Made your peace with her before you turned her into a lab rat? Don't mention my daughter. (STRAINING IN PAIN) You sacrificed your child for some lunatic genocide. It was worth it. Her life in exchange for the planet, as it should be. Uncluttered by the millions of human lives that will end... Right about now. CARA: (THINKING) Now, Stephen! ULTRA GUARD 3: Hold it right there! See? Told you you're too late. You brought Stephen. Clever girl. ASTRID: It's coming. Don't look at it, look at me. (WHIMPERING) We're gonna die. We're all gonna die. Just stay right here, ok? Right here. Ok. I'm here. I'm here. You know what the best part about being a human was? You. (STRAINING) FOUNDER: Enough of this nonsense. (GROANING) It cannot be stopped any more than evolution can be stopped. Don't you understand, Stephen, that human extinction is inevitable. But rather than thousands of years of slow decay and obsolescence this will all be over in the blink of an eye. Now what can be more humane than that? You killed him. He was never alive. I'm offering you you're rightful place as the planet's apex species. You killed my father! (YELPING) (GRUNTING) It was your uncle, a human, that killed your father. (FOUNDER GRUNTING) (STEPHEN GROANING) You're no match for me. And you're certainly no match for your father. What? Don't you get it yet, Stephen? Your father's powers are the Machine! A home without humanity. A refuge. That is your father's legacy. No. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) This is the future! And we are already living in it. How can a boy, even one as special as you, hope to turn the clock backwards? No, don't, Stephen, no! I guess time didn't stop. Are you sure? What about Stephen? You should go. I'll be right back. I'll be waiting. He did it. (FOUNDER YELPING) (STEPHEN GRUNTING) I am my father's legacy. (STEPHEN SCREAMING) Cara. Cara! (SCREAMING) Ahh! Cara! It's not who we are. You saved my life. You saved everyone! John. We did it. Yeah. I, uh... I guess we did. Hey. Not bad. Wait, I thought we're, like, here. No. And we're here. And we're going to switch to the 6 train. Hmm. Unless, you want to end up in Queens. I don't know, I've never been to Queens. Trust me. You haven't spent enough time topside to have explored the outer boroughs. Oh really, is that so? Mm-hmm. Wow, listen to the tough girl, huh? (CHUCKLING) Hi, John. How... how did you... Turns out it's a lot easier tracking a human than a paranormal, and... This is our stop. Jed, I'm kinda busy, so... Trust me, John, you're gonna want to see this. (SIGHING) I will make it up to you. I promise. I trust you remember this. Hunh. Stephen saved the planet and you're still trying to get powers. Well, John, these powers are for you. Your body will accept them. You were a paranormal once, you can go back to that. Don't you want your old life back again? Don't you want Cara back again? (EXHALING) You stole Irene's powers and now you want to give them to me. Oh, I don't think you understand something. It's not... Irene's DNA that I'm offering you, son. It's Roger's. No. No. Tell me you didn't. Roger was dead, his body was dead. But I've made him immortal. Why are you doing this? John, I'm offering you my blood. I'm offering you my brother, the most precious part of him so that he can live on in you. I thought all any father wanted was for his son to be a man. But what if you can be something more? She doesn't know? He doesn't know? She doesn't know? Well, ok. (BOTH LAUGHING) I mean do you... do you have any idea how laid you could get? You saved all of their lives. Even her? Yeah? You figure I got a shot? No. No. I don't think anyone would think a dork like you could save the world. Oh, thanks for that. Way to tame my ego. (LAUGHING) Yeah, that's why I'm here. Let's get some food. Some dumplings, a little Shu Mai? Mm-hmm. CARA: Stephen? You better get down here. Oh. You're doing your weird telepathy face. It's Cara. Ok? I gotta go. Ok. Hey, if you see John... I will tell him you're looking. For Love. Aw, aw! (EXHALING) Who are they? Breakouts. Who found all of them? They found us. Whatever you did at Ultra, sent up some sort of telepathic homing beacon. ♪ They're from all over, Stephen. And they keep coming. STEPHEN: That's great. Why are they all staring at me? Because you're their leader. They're here for you. No. They're here for us. For us. For us. It's good to have you back, Russell. Really? Really. We're gonna need a bigger Lair. CARA: This is insane, Stephen. It's temporary. Until we find a new Lair. Get some, bitch! STEPHEN: It's perfect. The place that hunted them is now a haven. And what about the people who used to work here? Well. The Founder's gone. Natalie and her gang are AWOL. Our future is only as small as our imagination. I like that. Thanks. I got it from a fortune cookie. You the lamest Chosen One ever. "Ever"? What about Jedikiah? Still haven't heard from him? You know you want to try it. (EXHALING) No. "No"? Well, if you'd like to, please. How is it? It's pretty damn good, actually. (CHUCKLING) Ok, get up. My turn. No. Ok. Get up. (BOTH GIGGLING) Oh! (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah, yeah. I could get used to this. What is it? Ever since that day, nothing's felt the same. I haven't felt the same. I can still feel it. Stephen, what did you do? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. (SCREAMING) Cara! What's wrong? I felt John. I felt like he was breaking out. That's impossible. Dr. Price. How did you get in here? I teleported. (SCOFFING) I'm calling security. Oh, no. Uh, don't do that. Please, sit, Senator. If this is about Ultra... Oh, no, I'm not here rattling the can for grant money. No, I want to start a new organization. Partnership. With whom? What branch of defense or intelligence wouldn't want a paranormal super-soldier? That's right, last time we talked about this, you had me thrown in a rubber room. Which is why I brought one with me. Senator Kelsey, meet John Young. My first prototype. Nice to meet you, Senator. JEDIKIAH: So, let's get down to brass tacks, shall we? Who are your contacts at the Pentagon? Well, that went well. What's this? Our next mission. You recognize her? Am I supposed to? What do you want with her? Well, if this little endeavor of ours is supposed to work, we, uh... We need recruits with your skillset. She's our first recruit. First of many.
