 Mr. Raqib. Detective Brown.

 We have the situation under control.

 Hey, Cal. 
 Damn it, Kane. 
 It's Alex. Hi, Alex. 
 Mr. Kane, what are you doing here? 
 Brown : Apparently, your government also decided to hire Vegas' biggest pain-in-the-ass security consultant to test your preparations. 
 Congratulations. You failed. 
 They're sealing off the balcony? 
 It's an easy point of entry. 
 22 floors up? That's ridiculous. 
 Farid : Mr. Raqib has better protection than the president of the United States. 
 Well, that would be a comfort, except they shot six presidents. 
 There's also an unsecured catering entrance in the kitchen. 
 Lock that down, too. 
 No, with all due respect, I will not be lectured. 
 Feel all that respect? 
 Oh, yeah. I'll handle it.

 How do you do that? 
 How do you figure out what bad guys are gonna do?

 How bad were the threats? 
 The trade deal he's negotiating ticked off the old guard back in his country, but it's worth $1 billion, so... 
 Excuse me. 
 What? 
 That guy doesn't work here. Right jacket. Wrong pants. 
 Shoot. 
 He's got the elevator key card and the communication set.

 You even sign the divorce papers yet?

 Hey, buddy. I'm real sorry. 
 I need to ask you some questions. 
 Yeah. 
 Mr. Kane, when Dr. Virginia Lee was found murdered in her home last night, you claimed someone else was present. 
 We ran down the strip. 
 A hundred people got the guy on their phones. 
 Well, lots of people filmed you running down the middle of the strip in your underwear. 
 No one confirms the other man when you were fleeing... 
 The woman who hit me with the car... she saw him. 
 We can't locate her. 
 The plates you gave don't match any existing plates. 
 [Recorder beeps] 
 We're friends. 
 We are. 
 And real soon, they're gonna pull me off this case because you're my friend and put on some guy who cares more about his clearance rate than the truth. 
 You were found with the damn murder weapon in your hand. 
 Come on. You were FBI. 
 What's the number-one rule when a woman gets killed? 
 Together : The husband always did it. 
 Alex, give me something, because right now, every cop we want out there looking for Ginny's killer is out making a case against you. 
 Cal, we were getting back together. 
 Last night, we decided. 
 I saw the guy who murdered Ginny. 
 I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna end him. 
 Don't touch...  don't touch me. 
 Hey, wait. Hey. Alex! 
 Out of my way.

 I'm Cassandra. 
 You are Alexander Kane. 
 Top in your class at Quantico. 
 Specialized in systems analysis. 
 Feds loaned you out to joint security operations. 
 You spent two years hunting terrorists all over Europe and Asia. 
 Yeah, you could have pulled that off my résumé. 
 Against direct orders from the United States government, you shot Ibrahim Chechik in the face. 
 When you broke bad, you didn't screw around, boy scout. 
 Are you MI6? 
 Bigger. 
 NSA? 
 Bigger. 
 There's no such thing. 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Wailing continues] 
 Okay, they just called in my plates. 
 So here's something cool. 
 [Wailing stops] 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 That's impossible. 
 "Impossible." Good. Stay with that. 
 I need you to wrap your head around impossible, Alex. 
 People will die if you do not belive in the impossible in the next... Eight minutes and six seconds. 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Console dinging] 
 Well, this is highly irregular. 
 But within the rules. 
 Mr. Kane, my name is Mr. Johnson. 
 The next thing I'm about to say to you you're not going to believe. 
 Most people don't. 
 I won't take it personally. 
 Johnson : A considerable time ago, a group of extremely wealthy individuals developed a system to predict crime. 
 That's it? That's your story? 
 You're crazy. Predicting crime is... 
 Impossible? Yes, Alex. Come on. 
 6 minutes and 55 seconds. You need to catch up. 
 You can't predict crime. There's too many variables. 
 One would think. 
 But there is one constant... Human nature... 
 Our willingness to commit sin to get what we desire. 
 You understand human nature, and then the rest is just data analysis. 
 We tracked weapon purchases, criminals on flights to Vegas. 
 Raqib's personal e-mail hacked. 
 Profile fits a kidnapping. 
 And the data-analysis part. 
 Man :  When you take the girl, kill the mother. 
 Kill the mother, and Raqib will do whatever we ask to save the girl. Kidnap Shada, kill Mrs. Raqib? We calculate five-to-one during the snatch, they accidentally kill Shada, and three-to-two, some innocent bystanders are murdered in the crossfire. That guy yesterday. He wasn't a kidnapper. No, he was a decoy sent to test Raqib's security for obstacles. And they found one... you. And then they sent a man to kill you. Ginny's dead because... Because you were with her. Our group would like you to stop this kidnapping. Do what you wish with the man who killed your wife. This can't be true. Well, there's a simple way to find out... do nothing. I mean, if you think we're insane or lying, you can stand there for the next... 5 minutes and 13 seconds. And nothing will happen. But if you are wrong and we can predict crime, that mother will die, and her daughter will be abducted by the man who murdered Ginny. Mr. Kane, do I look like I'm insane? [Car door closes, engine turns over] [Tires squeal] The game has begun. Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. [Engine revs] [Horn blares] Dial 911. [Ringing] Dispatcher : 911. What is your emergency? I need to report a kidnapp... What, a kidnapping? [Grunts] This is your first and last warning, Mr. Kane. You can tell no one the truth about our organization. You need to use your own resources to stop this crime. [Horn honks] We'll see if he lives. [Car door closes, engine turns over] [Tires squealing] [Horn honks] Take the phone. You forgot to ask me a question. Do you count as my resource? There you go. Ask me anything...  Within reason. I shall provide. Prove it. I need the access code for a four-star fire-system control panel. Model Foxtrot, Juliet, Niner, Niner, 4 - Romeo - 2. That's 1003702. [Alarm blaring] Fire alarm. Please clear the casino floor. And how does triggering the fire alarm help find the kidnappers? They're the only ones not looking for an exit. Get down! Get down! [Gunshots, people screaming] Move, move, move! Mom! Get Medina out of here! Alex! Man : Go! Go! ♪♪ That way. [Gunshots] Ohh! Ohh! Shada : Alex! Officer : LVPD! Drop your weapons! Over there! ♪♪ Anything? Officer : Got nothing. Put out an APB on Alex Kane. He is armed and dangerous. 
 
 ♪♪ Ginny :  Do good. You are good. [Door opens, closes] [Computer beeping] [Indistinct conversations] [Elevator bell dings] [Elevator bell dings] [Elevator bell dings] You led him here. Huh. Unacceptable. I left him a clue. That's all. A chance to understand. He earned it. Mr. Kane. What a surprise. Please. Come in. This is the house, Mr. Kane, where the probabilities of criminal activity are determined. There are always two members of the house. Cassandra is the dealer, and I am the pit boss. You said you can predict crime. How? We've been inside the world's information infrastructure since the days of telegraph wire. When phones arrived, we tapped them. When security cameras were born, we installed facial-recognition software. Backdoors into law-enforcement mainframes, spyware in financial and e-mail servers. Ada, bring up our files on Alex Kane. As you can see, we've been following you for a little while. The world is already watching itself, Mr. Kane. We just happen to be paying attention. You see, the men who developed a system to predict crime didn't do so out of a sense of altruism. They're gamblers. The very rich love to gamble, even more than the rest of us. But when you have so much money you could never lose enough to make a difference, ordinary games become stale. So you begin to look for other games... Games with higher stakes. Crime, Mr. Kane. We gamble on crime. You gamble with people's lives. No, here in the house, we  predict  crime. We never influence it. Did you predict the kidnapping? Did you predict Ginny's death? You could have saved Ginny. Do not... fold, Mr. Kane. You don't have a strong enough hand. [Exhales sharply] Why show me this? Why tell me this? What's the point of a bet unless you have two sides? Tomas Edribali, professional kidnapper out of Istanbul. When he targeted the Raqibs, his plan entered the game. He was one side. And you were the other. You unwittingly made this a wager worth playing. The gamblers would like you to finish this bet. We intercepted this earlier. Father, Mother, please pay them what they want. [Crying]  I love you both. I love you both so much. [  Sobs ] Shada and Ginny are people, not bets. I've seen your file, Alex. I know how Ginny saved you. You go back to being that man, it's like she never existed. Johnson : Well, you have a better chance of saving Shada... With us. You can make a difference right here, right now. Or... You can walk away. Time's running out, Alex. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for Shada and Ginny. When I'm done, I'm gonna come back here and throw you through that window. [Chuckling] Bravo. [Elevator bell dings] I'll take that bet. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Beeping accelerates] [Breathing heavily] What did you put in me? I used to be married to a doctor. I picked up a few tricks. Hamid, somebody sent you after Raqib. Who was it? Cannot stop us. Yeah, you were a decoy. They used you. [Chuckles] Focus. Door... you came in through the catering door. Who told you it was open? [Laughs] Even his own people hate him. [Laughs] I am telling you, Alex Kane was not one of the kidnappers! He saved me! Medina, you're confused. Farid is head of security. Yeah, I wouldn't really go by that. Stay where you are, Mr. Raqib... At least until Farid here tells us where your daughter is. How did you get in here? Kitchen catering entrance. It's still open. Tell me you weren't a part of this. The kidnapper's name is Tomas Edribali. Edribali stayed in constant touch with his crew. If he has an inside man, that inside man has a burner phone on him. He's the one pointing the gun at you. He's the one... Ohh! Show us this phone, or I will cut it from you piece by piece! Aah! Aah. In the pocket. In the pocket. Ohh. You have a call to make. [Ringing] [Cellphone ringing, vibrating] [Cellphone beeps] Why are you calling? I need to know everything's going all right. Is she still alive? Don't worry, Farid. We need her to talk. And when we don't need her to talk, we'll be done. What good did that do? That call's gonna be analyzed by some of the best equipment on earth. I do need your help. [Camera whirring] Cassandra : And if I hadn't been listening in? When does that happen? Never, actually. Call was too short to trace, but I pulled a little trick with the signal agency. They're still inside the Vegas cell tower array. They're here in the city. Traffic cameras tagged a black van as the getaway vehicle. Big crew, black van, plus holding for the girl. They're gonna need a base of operations. I'm gonna chat with a friend. You have access to the greatest intelligence database in world history, and you have a friend? Low-tech's the best tech. ♪♪ [Indistinct conversations] I'm counting on you, Victor. Remember, it's a black van. Yeah? Here. [Ring tone playing] [Cellphone beeps] Hello? Alex Kane? You have the wrong number. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hey! What was that rule about secrecy? Your cell battery's dead, you idiot. I need to show you this. Across the street. Yeah, I'm officially terrified of what you can do. They say wire the money by 4:00 P.M. [  Sniffles ] They say all you need is this number. [  Sniffles, whimpers ] They're gonna keep Shada alive in case of a last-minute proof of life. And then they're gonna kill her as soon as the funds clear. [Sighs] What do I do? Come on, Ginny. Help me out here. What do I do? You do good. Video is enough data to narrow it down, but not exact. Northeast corner of the city in the Route 95 pocket. Why are you at a homeless shelter? There's only so many places in this city that kidnappers can use as a base. Still too many to search. 10,000 homeless in Vegas. [Horn blares] If there's an abandoned building in this city, somebody's sleeping in it. And if that building was suddenly filled by men with guns, they'd warn each other. Look at you, low-tech. Alex! Got a place. Empty mall out by the highway. Diego got cleared out last week by some guys with some guns. Said they were security, but with no uniforms. And there was a black van. North of the 95?

This is not due process. You'd be surprised. It's a small step to go from shooting back to shooting first. Well, it's wrong. Absolutely wrong. And I liked it. I tell myself I'm saving lives, but three or four guys in, I can't even pretend anymore I'm doing it for the right reasons. But I'm good at hunting them.

Well, that worked out great last time. Take him with us. Yes, sir. Johnson : Here, you can see the gunman stop, turn, and fire at Mr. Kane. And here, you can see the car hit Mr. Kane. Ooh. Ouch. And here, you can see where the gunman escapes in the black van. I believe that's tied to your kidnapping case. Where did you get this footage? Well, the FBI's investigating an interstate car-theft ring, and we just got this off of the security cameras of the Augustine Casino parking lot. Would have been nice to see this yesterday. Well, we had no idea that this was on the tape until we reviewed it in the morning. Look, I assure you both the Las Vegas Police Department and Mr. Kane have the Bureau’s full apology. I believe that this video evidence actually exonerates him. This is a start. We still have a full investigation. And Mr. Kane is now way... Maybe I was unclear. You see, the, uh, state and the district attorney have already reviewed all of the evidence in this case and, uh, have agreed that Mr. Kane is to face no charges. He's free to go. [Chuckles] Well, I still need him to answer questions about the kidnapping. The Bureau's gonna take that off your plate. Being that it is our jurisdiction and all. You can send over all of the evidence and recordings as soon as possible. [Chuckles] Son, you done had one hell of a day. I feel awful about this. Let me offer you a ride home. I'm fine. I insist. I'm gonna take you exactly where you need to go. [Clears throat] [Sighs] [Handcuffs click] Alex : For what it's worth, you're the best cop I've ever known. What the hell are you into, Alex?

Because there aren't any security cameras in the parking lot of that casino. ♪♪ [Car doors close] This where you shoot me? Shoot you? Alex, you're a hit. We're offering you a job. I'm afraid I misled you earlier, Mr. Kane, when I said that there were always two members of the house. There are always three. See, the gamblers... They need someone to bet on. So we created the player. One man... one man and his resources and ingenuity set against the worst humanity has to offer. So they would bet on me? Mm, some would bet  against  you. Don't take it personally. So, Mr. Kane, will you be our player? [Laughs] All you have... You could stop so much pain, but instead, you gamble with people's lives for your amusement. [Chuckles] What do you see out there, Mr. Kane? A city. I see a safety valve. People need an outlet for their base desires or else they will act out. The gamblers are no different, except that when they act out, they destroy nations, rewrite maps. Kill presidents. No. No? What, that's it? You just go find some other guy? There's always a game, Mr. Kane. There is always the house. There is always the pit boss and the dealer. And there is always... Always, no matter what... Another player. But another player who'd never risk his life to save a kidnapped girl. You're the first player who cared about what happened to the innocents caught in the game, a player who actually wanted to help people. Imagine what good you could do. What happened to the last player? [Scoffs lightly] [Car door opens, closes] [Engine turns over] Man : Alex, you know I shouldn't be doing this. This is hers, not mine.

If I call, you come. It means a bet is in play. We didn't think we'd see you again. Yeah, I don't do well on my own. Idle hands. Besides, you have the best data in the world.
