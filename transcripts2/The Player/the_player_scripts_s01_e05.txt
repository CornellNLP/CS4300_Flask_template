 Previously on "The Player"... 
 Mr. Johnson : We gamble on crime. This is the House. Cassandra is the Dealer, and I am the Pit Boss. Mr. Johnson : Do you want to find your wife? I would do anything. Then let me help you. You have plans? Cassandra : Should we both share what we've been doing off-hours, when we think no one is watching? Because I'm up for it if you are. This is the life we've chosen. But I didn't entirely choose this life, did I? Power when used properly  can  do good. Then use that power to find my wife. I  know  she's out there. ♪ Hit me, baby. You know what you supposed to do. Another dice, sir? Yeah. Oh, okay. [laughs] Very good. Winner! [laughs] This the one right here. I know that for sure. You gonna come be working for me. Oh, damn! ♪ Man! This is crazy. I think it's time for you to close out for the night, sir. No, no, no, look, I'm just getting started. You owe $30,000. Yeah, I got that. What you talking about, man? $35,000. I got you. I got... Hey. Oh! [chuckles] Wait, no, wait. Hey, I think I may have left my wallet at home. Hey, man. Hey, get your hands off of me. Hey, hey! [crowd murmurs] [grunts] [speaks native language] No! Let him go! He's not who you think he is! I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, Mr. Johnson. My men didn't know who you were. Your debts here are forgiven. Well, thank you for that, Han. But it's  your  debt that interests me. I'm just here because you're a man that likes a story. Heard any good ones? There is s-something. Huh. Speak up. My ears are not as good as yours. Some Shui Kao friends of yours are in the States. Zeng brought them. Why? My government ordered a hit. On whom? I don't know. Please... Zeng will kill me if I tell you. Well, what do you think I will do to you if you don't? Okay. They're after a boy. I don't know his name. He was involved with some kind of computer virus. That's all I know. Okay. Thank you for that, Han. Keep me posted if you hear any more good stories. [speaks Han's native language] Ginny : [on recorded video]  Uh, you look so peaceful. Watch this: singsong voice Alex, time to wake up. Ooh! [ laughs ] I lost my wedding ring. You what? Got it! Nice job! To everyone at home... Hi! ...we miss you. [groans] Our honeymoon is terrible. We're having an awful, awful time. Alex : These dates aren't right. ♪ [printer whirring] ♪ So, you gonna work all night, or are you gonna come to the party? Mm. You know, there... there will be girls there, Solomon. You know, those strange creatures that you're afraid to talk to? [Indian accent] I'm not afraid. All right, dude. Just trying to help you. If you really want to spend all your time, well, like this... I'll take "this" over your crappy grades. What are you doing? The party will be next to pike place if you change your mind. Oh, no. Oh, no. [keys clacking furiously] ♪ [alarm beeps] No, no, no, no, no, no! [electricity zapping] Oh, my God. ♪ [drill whirring] ♪ If I had any new information about your wife, don't you think I would've told you by now? You know, I'm not sure  what to think about you, Johnson. You updating him on our new bet? I was just asking for some painkillers. I forgot how much it hurts to get shot. Well, it's been six days. A band-aid and an aspirin should do the trick. You were saying something about a new bet? Yes. A group of Shui Kao triads are on U.S. soil. Their target, a teenaged boy. Solomon Desai, computer-engineering prodigy and scholarship student at Parker Preparatory in Seattle. He's an Indian national. His family still lives in Punjab. How do we know this is the right kid? Eight Shui Kao flew from Hong Kong to Seattle two days ago. Young Solomon's focus lies in antivirus and security software. That's when he's not setting up networks on the Dark Web for drug dealers and weapons traffickers. I thought the government shut down Silk Road. Cut off the head of a hydra, another one grows back in its place. Solomon was 13 when Interpol caught him. He made a plea deal... locate the Russian distributors and the charges disappear. Now it seems he's hacked a very sensitive network. So, boy genius hacks the wrong person. Why do the gamblers care? Not the wrong person, the wrong government. The Pentagon's network is air-gapped to make it impregnable. The fact that he got inside this system is very impressive. I was gonna say "stupid," but sure, we can go with "impressive." We believe he uploaded a virus at the behest of the Chinese government, and now they've sent the triads after the boy to cover their tracks. The bet... can Alex Kane find Solomon before the triads do and get him to safety? You have 36 hours. This kid hacked the Pentagon. That's how NOC lists get leaked. That's how people get killed. You want me to keep him safe? That's the bet. So, what is safe when you have a team of armed men chasing you? The Indian consulate. No one can touch him without it becoming an international incident. Where is he? Ada can't seem to locate him. Huh. Solomon understands how to avoid surveillance, so, why don't  you  go with that low-tech research you like so much? Human intelligence, I think it's called. Easy. I used to be a teenage boy once. I know how they think. That's a terrifying thought. ♪ Cassandra : Cameras are online. Oh, you would  love this place. Everyone's face is plastered in a computer screen or a cellphone. I've always preferred computers to people. Yeah? Why is that? Because computers don't lie unless you tell them to. ♪ [chuckles] Hey. I'm looking for Sol... What happened to you? [both grunting] Alex, you should hurry up with that one. There are four more gentlemen heading your way. Yeah, that's not helpful, Cassandra. [both grunting] Whoop. Hey! [speaks native language] [pounding on door] The window. It's your best bet. Come on. It's only a two-story drop. That's a long way down. Alex? Yeah, I'm thinking! You don't have time to think. [yells] [groans] Cassandra : That's the spirit. Looks like low-tech went brilliantly. [groans] Did you know that a person's gait is almost as unique as their fingerprints? Kinetic parameters, spacial/temporal parameters, correlation between the two. Okay, I get it, I get it. You're a genius. Where's the kid? That's strange. Solomon's still on campus. He just went into a garage on the south side of the main building. Maybe the kid's not as smart as you thought. ♪ [door creaks] Don't mess with me! I-I'll kill you! I swear I will! I don't want to be here any more than you do, Solomon. How do you know my name? I know a lot of things. [crowbar clangs] Like whatever virus you put on the Pentagon's network could affect national security. It wasn't me. I... Guys like you, you never think about your actions. You just hide behind your monitors, playing games with people's lives. Look, first of all, the virus was already there when I hacked in, okay? And second, you've got to be aware of the Orwellian nightmare this country is living in right now. Between the NSA and the PATRIOT Act, it's borderline East Germany. [helicopter blades whirring] Hey, Cass? We've got trouble. Who's Cass? I'm in a bit of a bind myself. The school's surveillance feeds just went offline. I've got at least one bird overhead, and I don't think the triads would call that kind of attention to themselves. Nor would they have the capacity to wipe out surveillance capabilities at this magnitude. What's going on? It's not just the Chinese who are after you. [tires screeching] ♪ All right, listen up. Our priority is the boy. We'll attempt first contact with the kidnapper, find out what he wants. If that fails, we go in. Get your sniper in position. As soon as he gets a clear shot, take it. Alex : Now they're setting up a perimeter. Come here. I could give him back to the feds. They wouldn't kill him, hopefully. Dude, I can hear you. The gamblers wouldn't consider leaving Solomon in a black site for the rest of his life "safe." Works for me. Try again, Alex. We need to move. So you can feed me to the feds? I'll pass. Look, kid, the triads want you dead, and the feds want to put you in prison for the rest of your life. So if you want to see what's behind door number three, I suggest you do what I say. We should go in. What if he shoots the boy? You want to explain that to the President? He's probably working with those thugs that showed up at his dorm room. Intel thinks they're triads, by the way. Which means that virus is Chinese born and bred. How long till we breach? Two minutes! Come on. Let's take a ride. In that? It's kind of a work in progress. Something a professor and I are working on. You know, for extra credit. I never took you for a gearhead. I don't know what that means. So what's in there? Uh, electric motor, uh, a battery pack that can go about 100 miles before recharge, and a photovoltaic roof. Our boy's going to be rich if he doesn't end up in prison. How fast can it go? We've never driven it. Well, let's see how much extra credit you're gonna get. [machinery whirs] Ready? [tires squeal] [tires screeching] Man : Go! Go! Go! Straight up! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! You're a long way from Vegas. Good to see you, Zeng. What can I get you to drink? Tsingtao? Something stronger? Well, unfortunately this is a business visit. All work and no play. Well, it's difficult to play when the Shui Kao is doing wet work on American soil. Now, the only person I know who could make that order is the one I'm looking at. And his uncle. Well, the party called, we answered. Mm. You broke with House rules when you bet on a game that you hold a personal stake in. Are you threatening to cancel my bet? Oh, that's already done. I have $3 million on this game. Hmm. Well, consider yourself fortunate. Or do I need to remind you of what usually happens to gamblers who break rank? You'd rather lose millions than allow an old friend one misstep? No exceptions. Well, you've come so far since Hong Kong. Such a lost young  boy when we first met. Out of his element. A gambler who doesn't play by the rules doesn't get to play. You have my forfeit. This is your only warning, Zeng. You know what happens if there needs to be another... in my House. The House may not always belong to you... Mr. Johnson. Hmm. You know, I train here at night. You should spar with me tonight. You know, remember the  friends we once were. [chuckles] Some other time. Cassandra, what's our status? Our Player isn't faring too well with the gamblers. I'm not worried. We have a more pressing issue. Do a forensic analysis on Liu Zeng's movements over the last five years... bank accounts, bets, the whole nine. What did this unfortunate Mr. Zeng do? He attracted my attention. [engine turns over] It was a clever move calling in that bomb threat. It bought us some breathing room. My pleasure. The mariners were going to lose that game, anyway. Yeah. We need to find more transportation. The feds are gonna catch us soon. It'll be harder than you think. The car doesn't have a license plate, no GPS. Nobody likes a know-it-all, kid. What did I even do to you, anyway? You helped some very dangerous people run guns on the Dark Web. And instead of learning your lesson, you upped the ante with this virus. I told you, I didn't... Yeah, you didn't do it, you didn't do it. Hey, Cass? Do you have a way out of here yet? Give me a sec. Okay, there's an S.U.V. right in front of your location just waiting to be stolen, but I'd like to speak to Solomon first. [cellphone beeps] [ringing] Wh-Wh-Who is it? It's a... it's a business colleague. Hello, Solomon. I'm Cassandra. Tell me about the virus you uploaded. Like I already told Captain America here, I didn't install it. I was just being a tourist, looking for anomalies. The virus was already there. And why would we believe that? [sighs] What do you guys know about zero-day vulnerabilities? I know how to exploit them. In fact, I just used one to install tracking software on a phone that was hiding its GPS data. Hello? Hey, hang on, Cass. I think the kid just fell in love with you. Uh... wh-wh-whoever's running point on the Pentagon's antivirus team is behind on their security patches. What does the virus do? Corrupts the new missile-guidance system. Reroutes rockets. Self-detonates over populated areas. I was trying to destroy it when I was in their system, but they hacked me back. Fried my laptop. That's when I ran. Cass, this is bigger than what we do. I'm gonna hand him over. No! Please. When I first came to Seattle, I-it was hard to make friends. So I found some online. Yeah, but your buddies were Russian arms dealers who don't bother with background checks. I didn't know. [sighs] Not at first. They were nice to me, and... told me I was cool. Nobody ever thinks I'm cool. But I'm a white hat now... White hats don't hack the Pentagon. In order to safeguard against vulnerabilities, you have to find them first. Solomon, did you save any of the code? No. But I-I remember some of it. A lot of it, actually. How's that gonna help us outrun two teams of armed men? The NSA agents have changed their agenda. I decrypted several messages from the agents following you. Their new orders are to bring him in unharmed. They why are they shooting at me? Not at you, darling. Just at Alex. [helicopter blades whirring] Looks like the consulate's our best bet. It's now or never. Hey, you want to learn how to hot-wire a car? Yeah, come on. How did you guys know I was in trouble? We have our resources. Okay, well, which server did you breach to find me? And how did you get those NSA guys' text messages? Solomon. Obviously you got into Parker Prep. My mom could hack that place. But you had an inside track... so maybe you got into the NSA's network, which would make you my hero since it's impossible to do that unless your name is Snowden. I'm afraid I can't share that information with you, Solomon. But I appreciate the enthusiasm. Can you at least tell me if you liked "The Matrix"? What does she look like? Tell me. Come on. She's about 5'8". Blond. Blue eyes. She's hot, isn't she? She's, uh... she's attractive, yeah. So she's super-hot. Alex, turn left on Pas... Yeah, on Passmore Avenue. I know. [gunshots] [tires screech] Look out! Alex, what's going on? Oh, my God. Come on. [gunshots] Keep moving! Solomon : Why are they shooting at us?! Move. Get down. Get down. You okay? Head down. Run. Come on! Come on! [grunts] [gunfire] [gunfire stops] 
 
 ♪ Did you get shot? No, not today. Alex, the Seattle P.D. are closing in your location. Finding you new transportation now. Hey, don't worry. I know where to go. [grunts] Come here. This'll take us to olive. The consulate's three blocks from there. You think we'll make it? We'll make it. Man :  The express line for Main Street is now boarding. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Damn it. [Alex breathing heavily] All right. If you give me a gun, it would double our chances of reaching the consulate alive. Absolutely not. Why? Because firing a weapon at another human being is a choice you should never have to make. Here. How'd you wind up by yourself in Seattle? Some billionaire white dude built a school in my village. I'm pretty good at math. Got a scholarship. When I graduate, I'm going to make the best antivirus software anyone's ever seen. Then I can fly my family out here to be with me. I bet you will. Hey, I'd normally ask my friend Donovan about this, but maybe you can help me instead. I found some old pictures on a SIM card. See the ones that are highlighted? The dates are off by three days. It doesn't make any sense. Could be bad code in the program. Yeah, but the only pictures that are wrong are ones that I'd notice. They're fixed dates, like the 4th of July, or my birthday. I think there's a pattern there. I can't see it, but maybe you can. [gunshots] ♪ [woman screaming] Lewis! Oh, no! Alex, there's an express train passing through in 30 seconds. Yeah, and what good is that gonna do me? It'll provide a distraction. Get out of the way! Move! Move! There's a service entrance 20 yards down the tunnel. The kid and I will never make it. Not before the triads catch up or the feds arrest us both. [gunfire] ♪ [yells] Go! [grunts] I'm taking the train. [grunts] I know you're trying to protect the boy, but you're only gonna get him killed! Send him to me! No, please! Hey, Cassandra? I just had a suit offer to put himself between a bullet and the boy to protect him. If you lose Solomon, you lose the bet. Yeah, well, Johnson can take that up with me if I'm not in a body bag. How long before that train's here? 10 seconds. 9, 8, 7... Put your hand around me. I need you to cover for me! Are you crazy?! 5... Move! ...4, 3, 2, 1. Now! Stay with him. He'll protect you. Go, go, go! Man : Don't move! Don't move! [train horn beeps] Alex, are you...? Alex : Cass. I'm alive, but I lost the kid. [console chiming] [sighs] You really made us work for our paychecks today. Solomon, you don't have to be afraid any more. We're NSA. We are the good guys. You have heard of prism, haven't you? [chuckles] We need your help, Solomon. Our engineers realized you were trying to debug a program, not infect it. Did you find the virus? W-Was it still in the directory? No, by the time we realized you weren't the one that uploaded it, the real hackers had moved its location. Which is why we need you... to help us root it out. You're the only one on our side who's seen the virus code. Why would I help you? I mean, you're just gonna put me in jail. There are 20,000 missiles grounded because their guidance systems are infected. Three highly unstable countries under our watch are currently unprotected. If the wrong people find out about this, wars could break out. We won't arrest you, Solomon. Not if you help us. Hey, you're headed the wrong way. Where are you going? [speaking Mandarin] [gunshot] [gasps] I promised my friends we'd stop by. They got some questions for you. You can't kill me. I told my friend what I saw. Shut your ass up or I  will  knock you out. She's smart. Way smarter than me. Uh, s-she's probably listening to us right now. [GPS chirps] Cassandra : I'm listening, Solomon. Thank you for your text. It's wonderful what one can do with only the make and model and general location of a car. Disengage the GPS assist. Don't worry, Solomon. We're on our... [beep] [cellphone beeping] [cellphone rings] Did you deliver the package? Rehnquist : Not yet, sir. We have a problem. [phone beeps] Cassandra : Mr. Johnson, it seems our bet has taken a turn. One of the NSA agents is working with the triads. He's taking the boy to them now. Mr. Johnson : Ah, Mr. Kane. Always giving the gamblers a twist. [dialing] Alex : What? It appears you've lost our quarry. [panting] Why are you not pursuing? Yeah, the bet's over. I lost. I'm gonna take the rest of the day off. Maybe go to the spa. [panting] You still have 64 minutes. Yeah, well, Solomon's with the NSA. He might have to do some jail time, but at least he's alive. Alive, yes, but not safe. The Shui Kao had a man on the inside. Lots of fresh cash rolling in on this bet. The gamblers would like to see if you can get the boy back. Yeah. I would too. [grunts] The clock is ticking, Mr. Kane. Cassandra has a lock on the triad vehicle. Yeah, I'm heading there now. [tires screech] Strategy is your friend. Never forget that. The plan never survives contact with the enemy. [grunts] Excuse me. I'll give it back later! Hey, man! ♪ I've got eyes on. ♪ Cass, they're going to a high rise. What floor? The roof. There's a helicopter waiting. The pilot just radioed in. They're taking off in... five minutes. [engine revs] [tires screech] Alex! Help! Move! ♪ [helicopter blades whirring] Thank you for your help, Agent Rehnquist. You may go now. Aren't you forgetting something? You still owe me 50 grand. Oh, of course. I have it right here. [gunshots] Ohh! [speaks Mandarin] You think you can take us out on your own? Yeah, I hadn't really thought about it. I've been told I'm not very strategic. Go! ♪ [gunshots] Move! Looks like we're out of bullets. You fight unbalanced. Angry. You okay? That was  the  most badass thing I have ever seen. See what happens when you get out more often? Come on. My name is Louis Scrivner. Do you know who I am? Y-You're the Chief Technology Officer of the NSA. Woman : We were told you had a deal proposal? If Solomon is to help you, we must have assurances that no charges will be filed. This is an offer from the President of the United States. Solomon, the President is asking you personally to help us locate and destroy the virus that you saw on the Pentagon's database. In return, we won't press charges. One of our FBI contacts, Special Agent Forrester, has made all the arrangements. I can give you the number if you'd like. [American accent] You can sign the papers, Solomon. I know Special Agent Forrester, and he's a man you can trust. Once you help us destroy the virus, you can enroll at M.I.T. like you planned. All charges against you will be dropped. But only if you agree to our terms in full. Okay. But you guys owe me a new laptop. Thank you for your help, Ms. Davis. [normal voice] You did well, Solomon. Cassandra? People like us are good at the game of secrets. Secrets keep us alive. Let's keep this one between us. Of course. I hope I'm as good as you someday. You're halfway there. You just have to learn how not to get caught. You have a gift. You need to be careful with it. Oh, I almost forgot. I love "The Matrix." Mr. Kane. I still don't understand why you guys helped me, but thank you. Just do me a favor. Stop breaking into government servers. Unless the NSA ask, of course. Promise. Oh, you know, I was thinking about those dates you showed me. Uh, when exactly did you have time for that? I'm good at multitasking. And numbers keep me calm. So, I wrote a string algorithm. The dates in your photos are off by plus three... July 4th to July 7th... Yeah, I follow you. Assuming the incorrect dates in your files are the only numbers that mattered, I ran the permutations. There are 3.5 million possibilities in total. Okay. So, I went with Occam's razor... simplest answer is often the right one. 10 digits usually means... a phone number! So, I removed any permutations that wouldn't work with that theory. You know, area codes never start with number 1 or have the same three numbers in a row, right? Right. Out of the remaining combinations, there was one active phone number. How did you find out that last part? Consul General left his laptop open when you two were in the hall, so I hacked a few cellphone carriers. 702 is a Vegas number. I think someone wants you to call. Thank you. I thought we had no more business together. We don't. I was heading in and thought... well, I hoped that I could take you up on that offer to spar. You know, your... first days in Hong Kong, the others would barely look at you. They didn't like the idea of a foreigner in their circle. But uncle and I saw who you really were. Your uncle was a good leader. And you were his favorite student. But I follow orders. And you were never very good at that. [chuckles] [yelling] [both chuckle] Ahh, you haven't changed a bit. I did everything your family asked me to do. And  they  taught me about honor. Seems you no longer practice what they preach. [laughs] Oh. [groans] But I didn't know you were a cheat. Setting side bets with the gamblers... breaking the rules of the House... mm. Now, where is the honor in that? Why do you care? You work for the gamblers. I work for the House. And although it's obligated to keep the gamblers happy, it's also meant to keep them in line. Oh! [panting] The first time you won a match against me, uncle told you a story. While on a hunt, a king goes down by the river to fill his cup with water. This hawk swoops in and spills it on the ground. The king warns this hawk not to do it again, but it doesn't heed his warning. So the king chops its head off with a sword. The cup drops into the river. When the king retrieves it, he finds a poisonous snake lying in wait. The hawk was trying to protect its master. I've warned you about snakes in the water. [both grunting] [groaning] You're a fool! You have enemies everywhere... ones you don't even see! Aah! I see everything. I know what's coming for me. [yelling] Aah! [grunts] [breathing heavily] [yells] [groans] [panting] [yells] [panting] So are you the hawk, or are you the king? [shouts] I'm the sword. [straining] [computer beeping] If I had any new information  about your wife, don't you think I would tell you? [console chiming] [chiming continues] ♪ 
♪ Oh, my God. Ginny. [dialing] [ringing] [cellphone rings] I knew you'd find me. Ginny. I miss your voice. What's going on? Where are you? I-I don't know. They blindfold me every time we move. Have you seen their faces? No. Can you tell me what you see? About where they're keeping you? The clothes they're wearing, an accent, anything? Alex, I can't. Baby... have they hurt you? No. I'm okay. What do they want? They won't tell me. You tell them I'll do whatever it takes. Anything to get you back. Alex, I have to go. Don't try and find me. Please. They'll kill you if you do. Ginny... No. [dialing] [ringing] I have done  everything that you have asked. When does it end? When can I go home? I want to go home. [ringing, error tone] Woman :  We're sorry. You have reached a number that is no longer in service. If you feel that you have reached this recording in error, please check the number and try your call again. ♪
