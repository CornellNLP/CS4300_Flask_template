 Yeah, some would say that the person who tempts fate has never been in real danger.

 Huh. 
 See, I thought we left all this gang nonsense behind in Chicago. 
 Vice in Vegas is a growth industry. 
 The gang that controls it gets a new batch of customers every weekend.

 Carlos Salvado is the longest reigning gang leader in Vegas. 
 He's been on top of the Bravos for over a decade. 
 Johnson : A lifetime in gang years. 
 It's a family business. 
 Second-in-command is his eldest son, Hector, a frequent guest at some of Nevada's finest correctional facilities. 
 And there's Listo, Carlos' youngest son. 
 Hector's the brute. 
 Listo's the brains. 
 Where's his rap sheet? 
 Doesn't have one. 
 His job's keeping everyone else out of jail. 
 They make sure he never pulls a trigger.

 I managed to get her out, but I couldn't save her old man. 
 When it was all over, I found out that her dad was Big Joker. 
 A shot caller for the Pharaohs, right? 
 Hmm. 
 The Pharaohs took control of Vegas through a wave of violence and has held on to it ruthlessly ever since. 
 They don't just murder their enemies. 
 They make examples of them.

 Hector spends a fortune customizing his cars, and when you spend that kind of money, you talk to Samson.
