 Previously on "The Player"... 
 Ginny : Alex! No. Ginny. Maybe I can find the person responsible for Ginny. They'll be sorry. Kill this man... Tomas Edribali. Edribali was found dead in Pakistan less than four hours ago. I needed to talk to him. Do you want to find your wife? I would do anything. Then let me help you. Donovan : An S.D. card? I need all the information off of it. It was Ginny's. That's just between you and me. Now I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do for me. Hey, that stuff you took, what are you keeping from him? Ginny? ♪ Come on, let's go. [groans] Can't be late for these guys. I don't even know why you need me there. I need you to be beautiful, charming, so be charming. Oh, I forgot my sunglasses. I could fall over in shock. Cool the car down for me. Whatever you say, Your Highness. [engine turns over] [ big band music plays ] ♪  We can go anywhere  ♪ Where the hell... Babe, where'd you put my phone? Why would I move your phone? I can't find it. Okay, I'll grab it. Just hold on. I'll get it. Ohh! [grunts] [groans] ♪ Are you gonna help? Or are you just gonna stand there and watch? Ginny : I'm preserving the moment. It's our first place together. Oh, babe, it's a little bit streaky right there. Oh, look, you missed another spot. Let me preserve the moment, and you can paint. I was supervising. Oh! [chuckles] It's supposed to go on the table. But it looks so much better on you. [laughs] Oh, I think we should have gone with a lighter shade. I think you should marry me. Whoa. [beep] [cellphone rings] Kane. I'll be right there. [police radio chatter] [siren chirps] Hey, Kane! A moment please. Seems I am in need of a security consultation. Yeah, it seems so. How you doing? You guys okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You're not fine. Hey. Ray. Just give us a minute. That was too close. If it wasn't for those armored plates you made me put on my car, I'd be a stain on this driveway right now. Yeah, you have any idea who's behind it? Oh, you let me handle that. That's my business. You do your business. I want more of those fancy cameras in this house, every inch of this house, the best you got. Make sure you keep a couple guys outside your hospital room and your house around the clock. We really have to go, sir. All right, just no more needles. I don't like needles. Mm. Hey. Hey. Has someone taken a look at this? Oh, I'm okay. I just fell a little in the explosion. It looks like you fell more than a little. [exhales deeply] I should go with Ray. Oh, hey. I was really sorry to hear about Ginny. I've been lighting a candle for her. Thank you. That's really nice of you. It's the least I could do after all her help. [helicopter blades whirring] [radio chatter continues] [computer beeping] _ Interesting. April, where do you keep your spices? You're gonna make someone a fine wife someday. Shut up. Hey, listen, I was thinking that we would go on a ride today... mountain bike Red Canyon. Very ambitious. [chuckles] Well, we never have all day. You said you love to ride. It'll be like a normal date thing. Or we could go back to bed. ♪ I know she said ♪ [chuckles] ♪ That I don't need her ♪ 
♪ 'Cause every time I fall, she's sitting sweeter ♪ [cellphone buzzing] Ignore it. ♪ To get near her ♪ 
♪ But I'm feeling cold, and I must leave her ♪ I can't. Give me a sec. ♪ And I just seem to find ♪ [cellphone beeps] I have plans today. I cleared this. The gamblers are demanding a new game. I'm sure Nick will understand. My friends are none of your concern. Well, he's not the one I'm concerned about. You don't need to worry about me. That's not your job. You need to take care of yourself, Cassandra. I'll be in soon. [cellphone beeps, thuds] You'll be taking breakfast to go, then? A client got arrested. It's a pain in the ass. Mm. When are you leaving? First thing tomorrow. Tonight, then. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Sir, this is an active crime scene. Are you new? I'm Alex Kane. The, uh, PD and I, we have an understanding. We understand you get to annoy the crap out of us. [chuckles] In exchange, we let you do whatever the hell you want. Seems to be working so far. I take it you're not here out of concern for Ray's safety. Brown : Officially, the Department will do everything it can to bring Mr. Capello's attempted killer to justice. And unofficially? Well, I figure out who wants Ray dead, I get one step closer to putting that Mafia thug behind bars. [camera shutter clicks] Uh, sorry. Didn't know they're friends of yours. Well, clients. You and Monica go back. That gonna be a problem? [cellphone rings] Make sure to have a look at that orange wire on the inside of the door there. I told you this was working out. [cellphone beeps] You beckoned? There's been a development. You find something about Ginny? No. There's a game. You said no game today. Well, things change. Well, there's starting to be a pattern with you. Like when you said you'd help me find... Gentlemen. Good. We're all here. Great. Local Mafia boss was almost killed in an explosion. Good bet whoever wanted him dead will try again. Apparently 2 to 1 in the next 12 hours. To win the game, you have to stop Capello's killer. [scoffs] No way. My clients are off limits. Well, look at it this way... now you have all the resources of the House to help you save your friends. All right. I have to track down the hit man. Predictably enough, I'm a step ahead of you. Several, in fact. Try to keep up. [computer beeping] Using the security cameras you installed... quite good work, actually... I was able to get a look at the bomber. Yeah, that guy was pretty good. Mask, gloves, hard to I.D., didn't leave much behind. Right. Except for the bomb. I was able to determine that the trigger mechanism was connected to the car door. Alex : The car door. I found some melted wires in the panel. A similar mechanism has been used three times in the Southwest in the last 18 months. We can track the mechanism to the manufacturer. Looks like there are five on the black market. Cross reference sales with dates, times of explosions. Now we simply follow the wire transfer, and it leads us to our hit man. Devin Long, contract killer, specializes in explosives. Our friend Devin set up a shell corp a few years back, used it to buy a place in south shores, subdivision hit hard by the financial crisis. One man's foreclosure is another man's safe house. Have you found him? Yeah. Looks like somebody beat me to it. What do you mean? He's dead, and recently. I think he's still getting used to the idea. [groans] Whoever did it was a brutal son of... [door opens] Well, that's just great. What is it? He's still here. There's a camera. Can you get in? I'm in. I just don't see him. Kitchen! Get down now! [gunshots] Cassandra, how many?! Looks like he's alone. Okay, the shooter is Jacob Dagan, former Mossad. And it seems like he's decided to join the private sector. He's out front, getting in his car. [engine revs, tires squeal] Ah! You've got a problem. I can get him! According to Ada, your problem is there's more of him. Our killer's got friends, and they're all coming to town. Johnson : Well, if it makes you feel any better, I think the odds against you should be much higher. You know what would make me feel better? Finding the man who shot at you? Bingo. Now there's a game for civilized people. Your shooter went from Mossad agent to ruthless bounty hunter. Bit of a murderer's makeover. [chuckles] So whoever wants Ray dead did more than take out a hit. No, they put a price tag on his head. I did a bit of poking around on the Dark Web, and I found this advert. [whistles] I'm guessing that kind of money gets a lot of attention. Exactly what I thought. So I traced the traffic to the site, and it led me to these gentlemen. Cassandra : All bounty hunters. All caught on traffic cams within 30 miles of Vegas in the last two hours. Assault rifles, explosives, hand-to-hand. Remember the Argentinean ambassador found in a suitcase? That was this guy. And all five of them are competing for Ray's head. And a quarter of a million dollars. Your job just got four times harder. It's too risky to go after them one at a time. I got stop the hit at its source. I need to know who hired them. The bounty included the price and a satellite phone number, which has been taken out of service. I tried to forensically trace the line, but it just kept bouncing me all over the world. Like I said, the odds against you should be much higher. I'm not interested in the odds. I'm only interested in my client not getting killed. Well, I'm only interested in the odds. And in this case, our interests happen to be aligned. And I might have a contact that will be able to help us both. Is that allowed? The resources of the House are at the Player's disposal. Simple enough. [tablet beeps] [tablet whooshes] [elevator bell dings] The window's closing. I've worked with law enforcement enough to know that people... I'm working on it. What are you doing specifically? I'm specifically doing everything that can be done. [chuckles] I get it. The mysterious, stoic bit. I bet the ladies love that. Me personally, I'm not a fan. Not when it comes to finding my wife. Trust, Mr. Kane. We need to have trust. [ elevator bell dings ] It's the key to any long-term relationship. [tablet whooshes] There's been a development. You find something about Ginny? No. There's a game. You said no game today. Well, things change. There's starting to be a pattern with you. Like when you said you'd help me find... Good. We're all here. [console beeping] Alex Kane, colleague, private security. Alex, meet Pauly Agostino. Of course. [chuckles] I'm friends with your daughter, Monica. I wasn't aware you two knew each other. No? What, you didn't tell him I saved your life? Twice if I was the type to keep track. Yeah, well, you know him. He's not much of a sharer. I've known him since he was a buck 25 soaking wet. He and I were playing with the big boys in Chicago. The kid couldn't lose until, you know, he could. We need to talk about your daughter. What about her? We believe she's in danger. Somebody took out a bounty. And you think I'd know something about that? Well, there was a time when nothing happened in this town without you knowing about it, Pauly. Things change, but not that much. So if you have any idea who Ray pissed off lately... My son-in-law and I don't exactly chat over cigars and cannoli. Pauly, I will find out who did this, and I'm gonna take care of it. Fine. You want to know? It was me. I took out the hit. Ray turned my own people against me. And I gave him everything. I'm not going to my grave [breathes deeply] knowing that piece of crap's in charge. You nearly killed your own daughter, you know that? I warned her not to marry him. She was dead to me the minute she walked down that aisle, pal. Call it off... the bounty. Can't. Running out of time. Only regret is not killing him myself with my own two hands. I guess that old saying's true, isn't it? Daughters really do marry their fathers. You need to show some respect. [wheezes, coughs] So, you're from Chicago. Let's talk about it over a cold one sometime. Why'd your friend lie to us? You don't think he put out the hit? Do you? Yeah, I didn't think so. He's protecting someone, and I think I know who. What the hell is he doing here? Probably the same thing we are. Get rid of him. No authorities. [men shouting indistinctly] You understand? Alex : You following me? All right. Guess Pauly's got a lot of visitors today. He have anything to say about the hit? You can ask him yourself as long as you're here. He won't talk to cops. You being a friend of his daughter, though... He, uh, he says he doesn't know anything. Really? You were in there a while. How long does it take to say, "I don't know anything"? Well, you know the type. He likes to tell stories. Yeah, I know the type. Come on, Cal. I wish I had more. Just think real hard about who you're protecting, Alex. You make sure they're worth it. [car door opens] Yeah. [car door closes] [knock on door] Hey. You alone? Yeah. What's going on? Your dad get that for you? You come over to talk jewelry? I know it was you, Monica. I know you ordered the hit on Ray. Your dad said he took out the hit. What are you doing? Just ensuring that we can speak freely. Ugh. He also said you were dead to him. But he's still wearing the other half of this necklace, and I'm guessing it's not because he really likes sparkly things. He's covering for you, Monica. Tell me I'm wrong. Get your hands off me. You didn't get that in the explosion, did you? I'm so sorry I didn't see this before. That night I found you all beat up, you said it was an enemy of the family. You said you couldn't go to the hospital for fear of retaliation. So I called Ginny, and the black eyes and the broken bones she patched up, Ray did that to you, didn't he? [sighs] Monica, I can't protect you if you're not honest with me. Look, I don't have a problem with you killing Ray. The guy's been beating on you. I get the chance, I might take him out myself. No! Stay out of this. I'm taking care of it. But you're not. That bounty you took out brought a company of very bad men to town. What bounty? I hired one guy. Devin... an old friend of my father. Four fingernails. We got to go. Go where? I'll explain later. Come on. We got to go. Hey, Alex! In case it isn't obvious, my days of being pushed around by men are over. You want me to jump at your command, you need to tell me what the hell is going on. Your guy was killed. He was tortured. Someone pulled off four of his fingernails. Now, you don't stop at four unless you get what you want. You think he gave me up. I  know  he gave you up. Ray knows you took out the hit. We need to go... now. 
 
 Look, for a quarter-million, I don't want excuses. And the price drops five Gs every hour she's alive, all right? I need this to get done. Now. [cellphone beeps] ♪ Monica, let's go. Looks like I got here just in time. You going somewhere? Cal, what're you doing? My job, Alex. I'm doing my job. So I'm gonna need you to come down to the station with me. On what grounds? On the grounds we found the body of a dead hit man. We got his name, followed the money trail, and it led to an account linked to a RICO investigation. That account belongs to you, Monica. So you choose... be questioned as a suspect in an attempted murder case or become a federal witness, testify against your husband. He'll kill me. We can protect you. Get you in WITSEC. [scoffs] It's your best option. Either way, you're coming with me. Cal. You have no idea what's going on. Oh, then tell me, Alex. Tell me what's really going on. Right. Let's go. It's okay. Cal, don't do this. [cellphone rings] [scoffs] [cellphone beeps] What? You handed Monica over to the authorities. That's grounds for a mis-deal. I didn't hand her over. If you call the game off now, you are signing Monica's death warrant. Ray's got half the LVPD on his payroll. She won't last a night in lock-up. And what would your friend Pauly think about that, huh? [sighs] Okay, the game stays in play. But the gamblers are gonna demand consequences. Fine. Whatever. Get her back from the authorities... immediately. [cellphone beeps] Won't be a very long game if you don't get moving. One of the hunters just found Monica. He's closing in now. ♪ [cellphone beeps] Call Cal brown. [ringing] [cellphone beeps] Johnson : What did I tell you about contacting the authorities? They're gonna kill her! Yes. That's the game. And your job is to stop that from happening. [tires squeal] The hunter's advancing at .0125 miles per second. To catch him, you need to increase your speed to 199 miles per hour in the next 10 seconds. So I'm going to need a plan-B then. Turn right now. He's only the first. More hunters are closing fast. Get down. [screams] [tires screech] [tires screech] Cal, get down! Cal, on your six! I got him. Alex! [sirens wailing] Monica, come with me. Come with me! Come on. Come on. Come on. [tires squeal] Hey! Alex! Alex! Are you okay? Yeah. Where are we going? I'm about to find out. Well, that was exciting. I need a safe house. You bet. Radius? 10 miles, maybe less. As long as we're on the move, we're exposed. I do security for a contractor, he's got at least six projects on the outside of town. Start there and call me back. Got it. [cellphone beeps] Who was that? A colleague. [cellphone rings] Well, that was fast. Brown : Are you out of your damn mind?! You are on the run with a federal witness, Alex! You need to bring her in right now. I can't do that, Cal. I bring her in, and she's dead. You're obstructing justice! No, I'm protecting my client. She's not under arrest. She's not even an official witness until you have a case, which you don't. Arrest Ray for something, and I'll bring your witness back. Alex! [console chiming] You'll do. What do you got for me? The Tamerlane. It's an old hotel. Yeah, I know it. Been closed for years. Seems like it's under renovation. I suggest the top floor. Looks like it hasn't been renovated yet. Monica : You kidding me with this? [scoffs] You couldn't have picked a safe house with working elevators? Oh. It's a Saturday, construction crew is gone, so you'll have the place all to yourself. Come on. The room at the end of the corridor's being used as an office. It's secure. Allow me. [lock disengages] Thank you. Come on. Welcome. I trust your accommodations are satisfactory. Stay here. You okay? Yeah. Okay, come on. [light switch clicks] Oh, we've got lights. That's good. [cellphone buzzes] Damn it. What's wrong with you, Ray? Haven't you heard... happy wife, happy life? LVPD's giving out marriage advice now? Aren't our tax dollars better wasted busting jaywalkers or scratching out parking tickets? No advice. Just a heads-up. [clears throat] Your wife is flipping on you, Ray. Giving up where all the bodies are buried. I think you're wrong about that. My wife, she's not a stupid woman. Mm, we know she took out the hit on you. We got her on that. So she's making a deal. It's the smart thing to do. And, like you said, she's not stupid. I appreciate the heads-up. Very kind of you. But, if you don't mind, I need to get some rest. You bet. You've had a long day. I'll leave you to think. Thanks. And, uh, if you're smart like your wife, pretty soon you're gonna realize you've got one move left... Come clean, take a plea. 'Cause in just a few hours, you've got no more leverage, Ray. And believe me, you don't want this to go to trial. I know how much you hate needles. [groans] [dialing] [groans] Listen, new orders. Don't touch her. Bring her to me. I got to find out what she's been saying. [sighs] And then I'm gonna kill her myself. [tires screech] You think your friend is gonna bring Ray in? I don't know. He's a good cop. And if he does, then what? Are you gonna make me testify? I figured you'd want to stick around, make sure the scumbag gets what he deserves. It's complicated. Yeah, well, so is disappearing. You know, if you go, you can't come back. Is that really the life you want? It's not just my life I have to think about anymore. Wait. Are you... Some women buy a crib. Some paint the nursery. Me? [chuckles] I take out a hit on my husband. I take it Ray doesn't know. Not this time. [sighs] Wait. There was a last time? What happened? What did he do? If you're the kind of guy who beats his wife, you're the kind of guy who beats his pregnant wife. I should have left him then. Promised Ginny I would. [scoffs] She really never told you? No, she didn't. The night you found me, after Ginny patched me up, she gave me her number and told me to call her if an enemy of the family ever came after me again. One night, Ray threw me down the stairs. There was so much... There was nothing she could do. But she sat with me all night, and I begged her not to report it. I told her Ray would kill me, and I swore I'd leave. I promised her. [scoffs] And here I am... two years later. [sighs] Yeah, well, you're leaving now. I am not a murderer. And I do not want to live life on the run. But if that's what it takes... Hey. Hey. Come here. What the heck was that? What's wrong? The lights just flickered. Yeah. [console beeping] Come on. Okay, they found you. Get out of there now. How'd they find us? I don't know. There's no way. Looks like they're about to... ...cut the power. I'm blind. Secure Monica, hold your position. Okay, here. You have two shots. Anyone comes through that door, you pull the trigger. Do not hesitate. You understand? What are you gonna do without a gun? [breathing heavily] Whatever it takes. Cassandra : Alex, the cameras are out. I don't know where they are, but they were spread out, all coming from different directions. They have night-vision goggles. Be careful. Sounds like a coordinated attack. I think our bounty hunters have teamed up. Man : Let's split up. Man #2 : I'll take this floor. [camera shutter clicking] Aah! [grunting] [cellphone beeps] All right, where's the gun? Where's the gun? [door opens] [door closes] [door closes] [door closes] [gas hissing] [screams] Alex, is that you? [glass shatters] Alex! Hey! Hey! Here, take these. Run. Do not stop! Stop! Ginny : What's your name, soldier? What's your name? It's Alex. Alex. Stay with me, Alex. Don't give up on me, Alex. [groans] Where am I? You're in Sudan. [groans] You're gonna be all right, all right? I've got you. Stay with me. It's okay. [monitor beeping] Here, drink this. It'll help with the pain. Ohh. Didn't say it would taste good. Doctor Virginia Lee... Yes, Alex Kane. Has anyone ever called you Ginny? You look like a Ginny to me. I suppose I could get used to it. Don't go. I have to. Wait. Ginny. Ah! [exhales sharply] [groans] [laughter] You should have turned yourself in when you had the chance, Ray. Wow. Come on, Detective. We both know you got nothing. Monica didn't talk. No, you're right. She didn't. That was just a little bluff to get you to do something stupid. And for the first time, Ray, you have exceeded my expectations. Ray :  I need to find out what she's been saying, and then I'm gonna kill her myself. Tell all those yahoos to stop shooting at each other and team up and just bring her to me. I don't care what it costs. [exhales deeply] What? That's all you got? Unless you got a warrant for that wire, which I know you don't, you got nothing. All right? It'll never stick. Oh, it'll stick. I didn't need a warrant, 'cause I'm not the one who recorded it. Sent to me anonymously. Seems you got a lot of enemies, Ray. It's shocking for a good fella like yourself. I've waited a long time to say this, Ray. You are under arrest for attempted murder. All right. It's a shame you tried to kill her, Ray. She's gonna have your baby. Jury's gonna love that. [console beeping] [door opens] I didn't know you were still here. The next game can wait. You should go home. I was just leaving. You have plans? Maybe. Should I tell you about them? Should we both share what we've been doing off-hours, when we think no one is watching? Because I'm up for it if you are. I understand what you want... life in here, with all its power and control and a life out there, simple, normal. Been there, tried that, and it doesn't work. You'll end up being hurt, and I don't want to see that happen. This is the life we've chosen. But I didn't entirely choose this life, did I? [laughs] You decided not to run. Yeah, well, I had to return your car. [laughs] Ohh. Oh, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I wanted to say goodbye. You're disappearing. No. I'm testifying. [exhales sharply] You sure you want to do this? Mm. I've got a hunch Ray won't be coming after you anytime soon. It's not about him. Hmm. [sighs] I wish Ginny would have told me. I would have helped. I made her promise not to. Who knew my wife was so good at keeping secrets, huh? What? Nothing. No. What? I have to go. Hey, don't make me use this card, but I did just take a bullet for you. Do you know something about Ginny? Alex, it doesn't matter... No, it does matter. It matters to me. I saw something of myself in her. Spent a lot of years looking over my shoulder, been around a lot of scared people. And after a while, you learn to recognize that look. You saying Ginny was scared? Of what? I don't know. All I can tell you is... I know what fear looks like. And Ginny was afraid. Oh, man. [sighs] Good. You're still here. Hey. Delay your flight. Come on, let's go on that bike ride you were so excited about. I can't. I got to get back for work. Well, let's quit. Let's go to an island where no one can find us. I'm in. I'm sure there's a flight leaving for Tahiti any minute. They'd find us in Tahiti. Oh, all right. When are you coming back? I don't know, April. [sighs] Everything's always so complicated with you. I know. I'm sure it must feel like that. It won't always, I promise you. [door closes] ♪ You did this, didn't you? There's no way the hunters just happened to find the safe house. Cassandra's too good for that. Someone had to give them the location. It's nice to see you're not denying it. I warned you that there would be consequences. I believe your exact words were, "Fine, whatever." We could have been killed! Yeah. As I said, it's all a part of... The game, yeah. Yeah, I get it. I'm your pawn. I signed up for this. But Monica did not. Ginny did not. If you want to mess with me, that's fine. But if you want to mess with the people I care about... You were saying? What the hell is this? Take him out. Johnson : Ray Capello's been arrested. Yeah, I can see that. Shouldn't he be in holding? Isn't sticking him straight in a federal prison skipping a little due process? [sighs] Over-crowding. You arranged this. Why? I owe Pauly my life. He trusted me. Saving an innocent woman, wife-beater gets what he deserves, not a bad day. You said you wanted to do good. Well, power, Mr. Kane, power when used properly  can  do good. Then use that power to find my wife. I know she's out there.
