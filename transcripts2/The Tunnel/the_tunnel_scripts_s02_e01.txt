 There you go, sir. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Large chips, please. 
 (Dog barks) 
 (Indistinct) 
 Mm. 
 Go get the ball. 
 Get it, Tinks. 
 Good boy, Tinker. Come on, baby. Tinker? 
 Tink! 
 (Whistles) Come on. Good boy. What have you got? 
 Good boy. 
 Where did that come from? 
 That's a passport. 
 Where did he find this? There's more. 
 There's loads of them. 
 There's another one here. 
 Nick! 
 Guys, look what I've found. 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 I don't know. 
 Some sort of cross or... 
 I dunno. Come on. 
 Wait! Stop! Look. 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 Careful. Careful. 
 Careful. 
 Read it, Rob. 
 I don't understand. Oh, never mind, come on, let's go. 
 Bet you can't catch us! (Laughs)

 (In French) 
 (Rapid beeping) 
 (Rapid beeping) 
 (Chloé screams) 
 (Rapid beeping) 
 (Car horns) 
 Yeah, we've got a vehicle from the French side seemingly abandoned. 
 No sign of its occupants and blocking vehicle egress. 
 VW Tiguan registration BQ703FX . 
 Thanks, Charlie. I'll notify security. 
 VW, BQ703FX. That's the Fournier family. 
 Should be three passengers, two adults, one child. 
 Can you get a tow truck down here? 
 The other passengers are starting to kick off. Yeah. 
 (Car horns) 
 (She murmurs) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 Karl Roebuck, Public Protection Unit. 
 Hello, Karl Roebuck, Public Protection Unit, this is a real police officer speaking. 
 Ah, very good, BB. What's up? 
 I'm outside your gaff. 
 Just dropped off the little girl from the tunnel. 
 She's in a bad way . 
 Who's looking after her? 
 Er, dark curly hair. Not bad. You might. 
 That sounds like Yolanda, from the hair. She's good. 
 Chief Inspector said to give you a call to make sure you were part of the loop. 
 Oh. Did he now? 
 (Northern accent) "Get the girl over to the PPU and make sure Roebuck's part of the f*cking loop." 
 All right, what's the girl's name? 
 Chloé Fournier . 
 She's in a really bad way. She won't say a word and she's holding onto her toy dog for dear life. 
 All right. I'll get over there. Cheers. 
 See you later. 
 (He exhales deeply) 
 (Laughs) 
 I now pronounce you man and wife. 
 You may kiss the bride. 
 (Lens clicks) 
 (Lens continues clicking) 
 (Car door opens) 
 Great. Thanks. 
 Congratulations. 
 You may now kiss the European Union. 
 (Whistles) 
 (Door lock clicks) 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Where's my passport? 
 Where's the money you promised? 
 (Man speaks indistinctly through earphones) 
 That problem's dealt with. He's on the flight. 
 I took care of all the arrangements myself. 
 Mm-mm. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 The groom is satisfied. Time for the wedding video. 
 You got a honeymoon destination? 
 Maldives. 
 You sure? 
 It's what the client wants. 
 Don't know how anybody could get a kick out of this, that's all. 
 Who cares as long as we get paid for it? 
 You just worry about more brides. 
 Ticket for the flight to Paris. 
 (Buckles jangle) 
 Hey. 
 You. On the bed. 
 (Door closes) 
 Please. 
 Don't hurt me. 
 (Screams) 
 (Clippety-clop noises) 
 (Makes clippety-clop noises) 
 Oh, I know. This would be a very good opportunity for me to practise my French. 
 C'est un chat. 
 Woof, woof, woof! 
 Woof, woof! 
 Ah! Oh! 
 Ce n'est pas un éléphant. 
 Brrring, brrring, brrring. 
 Hello? 
 Je m'appelle Karl. 
 Je travaille dans le Winnie the Pooh suite. 
 Would you say Winnie the Pooh in French? 
 On dit Winnie the Pooh en français? 
 Excuse-moi. 
 Karl Roebuck Louise Renard. 
 And you are? 
 Has she spoken yet? 
 No. 
 Bonjour. 
 Maybe don't crowd her. 
 She's in deep shock. 
 Well, he's not called Winnie the Pooh in French. 
 No, I thought perhaps he wasn't. 
 I'm guessing it's not Winnie Le Merde either. 
 No, Winnie L'Ourson. 
 Winnie the Bear. 
 Piglet? 
 Er, Porcinet. 
 Sounds like one of the Musketeers. 
 So this is your department now? 
 Yeah. Yeah, we deal mainly with immigration issues, domestic abuse, sexual violence. 
 Winnie the Ours, er... 
 L'Ourson. 
 ...Ourson suite for kids. 
 This is certainly an unusual one. 
 But you're not investigating it? 
 No. 
 I'm just dealing with the child's welfare. 
 I'll take you through to CID as soon as Louise fails to establish communication. 
 Chloé? 
 Only act. 
 No! No! No! 
 Always remember that. 
 Hurry up, we have a lot of work to do. 
 Jesus Christ! Call the police! 
 Bonjour. 
 "Ladies and gentlemen, campaigning for justice and human rights has brought me... many beautiful friends." 
 And a few bodyguards. 
 Mm. 
 (Horn blasts) 
 (Cries of gulls) 
 Let the psychologist do her evaluation and try again later, Louise. 
 You said you were going to leave the police. 
 Yeah, well, not so easy with six kids. 
 I thought you didn't want Olivier's job. 
 I didn't. 
 But the other guy who could have replaced him hates me. 
 Poor judgment. 
 Yeah, I think so too. 
 It has quite a ring to it: Commander Wasserman. 
 So what are you doing here then, Commander? Afraid to delegate? 
 (Distant sirens) 
 Ah, BB. 
 Elise Wasserman and Louise Renard from the Calais police. 
 Enchanté. 
 DC Boleslaw Borowski, more commonly known as BB. Hello. 
 Or Jammy. 
 Why? 
 Jam Roll equals Pole. Which I am. 
 Originally. 
 Er, it's rhyming slang. 
 Dog and bone equals phone. 
 Boat, that's your face. 
 Boat doesn't rhyme with face. 
 Boat race. 
 You just say the first word that doesn't rhyme. 
 Would you like some coffee? 
 Oh, thanks, Karl. 
 White no sugar for me. 
 Black, right? 
 And? 
 Right. 
 This is for you. 
 Thank you. 
 It's like they vanished into thin air. 
 Call Roebuck for me. 
 A little bird tells me you might be coming back to CID, Karl. 
 You'll be the last to know, BB. 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 Yes, Nat. What's happening? 
 Bb : Why are you telling me? 
 OK. 
 Yeah. OK. 
 Now. 
 Check with Eurotunnel, see if it's one of the vehicles still unaccounted for. 
 Right, well, I'll leave you with BB. 
 We've got a burned-out van just off the Grayling Road. 
 Signs of a shooting. Come on, we'll go in my car. 
 You know where we are. Come and see us. 
 So, six months off work compassionate. 
 I imagine that was no picnic. 
 Not really. 
 Six months handing out hankies in the PPU. 
 Yeah, well... it's a bit more than that. 
 I'm not gonna denigrate the department... 
 Yes, yes, very commendable, three cheers for them. 
 So, have you thought any more about? 
 I've thought about it. 
 You're an investigator, Karl, always have been, always will be. 
 I'd like you to take on this Fournier case. 
 It is right up your boulevard. 
 You on the happy pills? 
 No, I think their effect is more placebo. 
 You're a clever c**t, Roebuck. 
 Thank you. 
 It's what you're known as. Not always in a good way. 
 Well, can't please everybody, I guess. 
 Luckily for you, I do like a clever c**t. Always have done. 
 You're halfway there yourself, sir. 
 Come back to CID, Karl. 
 It's where you belong. 
 (Sirens wail) 
 Bb : The van was on the same train as the Fourniers. 
 Two bullet casings. 
 Suggests either a professional execution or... 
 Two victims. 
 We'll have the blood analysed, then we'll get it crosschecked to DNA from the vehicle. 
 What type of gun was it? 
 Still not sure. 
 But the ballistics guys say it's unusual. 
 Possibly a Norinco 77. 
 Chinese. 
 You know your weaponry. 
 I'm not saying that cos you're a woman or anything. 
 I didn't think you were. 
 I'll keep you updated. 
 
 
 
 (Door opens) 
 (Whimpers) 
 Ne! Ne! 
 (Screams) Ne! 
 Ssh. Ssh. Ssh. 
 (Muffled shout) 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Here. 
 Leave tonight when they're sleeping, yes? 
 Leave, because they're going to kill you. 
 Wait. Please take this. 
 God bless you. 
 I'm missing a training course. 
 Oh. 
 Developing managerial and leadership excellence. 
 Tomorrow we were supposed to be tested for our personality types. 
 ENFJ I'd say. A giver. 
 Fun-loving, popular and sensitive. 
 Outstanding people skills. 
 OK, you're teasing me now. 
 Yes, I suppose I am. 
 I'd pay good money to see that test, though. 
 So we have roast chicken. Hope that's OK. 
 I thought you always cooked vegetarian. 
 Adam was the vegetarian. 
 We just tended to cook that way. 
 Yes. I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 Do you want to go and see the twins before dinner? 
 Only if you want me to. 
 I don't find looking at babies particularly interesting. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Indistinct) 
 (TV on) 
 on TV :  Hey, man, you're not gonna kill me, are you? 
 (Breathes nervously) 
 (Rattles door handle) 
 (Door unlocks) 
 (Baby cries) 
 (Karl hums) 
 Elise : Karl seems to be settled in his new job. 
 Laura : It was OK for the first month after Adam's death, but he's getting restless now. Missing the investigating. 
 I'll wash up. 
 This is how we do things when I eat with my boyfriend. 
 Hm. 
 Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. 
 I just didn't think you were the boyfriend type. 
 I'm trying it out. 
 And? 
 Sometimes he talks when I don't want him to. 
 Yeah. Yeah, they do that. 
 You're tired. 
 Well, you know, kids, twin babies, housework... 
 The twins must be taking a bit of time to settle. 
 I'll do the washing up. You take Karl's drink up to him. 
 Go on, give them a wave at least. 
 Karl? 
 Karl : Elise? 
 I was looking for you. I brought you your drink. 
 Thanks. 
 So you sleep in Adam's room. 
 I was gonna do all that stuff, remember? 
 Expose Peloton. 
 I just, er... 
 You went back to work instead. 
 Yeah. I went back to work. 
 Chloé's mother, Madeleine... she works for the French government. 
 She mainly deals with cyber crime from the Far East. 
 It's why Olivier sent me here. 
 Ah. 
 He now runs the anti-terror bureau in Paris. 
 BB doesn't know this. 
 No, I'm only telling you for now. 
 So you think Madeline Fournier could have been abducted. 
 What about the husband? 
 There were two bullet casings at the scene. 
 Apparently from a Chinese gun. 
 If it was a hit, why spare the child? 
 They're not sentimental at that level. 
 That's true. 
 What does the husband do? 
 He's a businessman in computer software. 
 What sort? 
 Advanced GPS devices for large transport fleets. 
 Both techies, then. 
 They weren't just any couple. 
 Hm. 
 Laura misses Adam also. 
 She appears to be tired and unhappy. 
 Well, say it like it is, Elise. 
 (Applause) 
 Man :  Thank you. We are here to honour Judge Paul Gresson, a man who's made it his life's work to campaign for justice on the international stage . 
 He has tackled tyrants, criminals, rogue states, drug barons, and I'm very proud on behalf of our university to award him this doctorate in recognition of his human rights work. 
 (Applause) 
 Bresson :  Thank you. This is an honour . 
 Campaigning for justice and human rights brings many beautiful friends . 
 And a few bodyguards, of course . 
 (Laughter) 
 (Flight announcement on Tannoy) 
 Thank you. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Thank you. 
 Any luggage to check in, sir? 
 No. 
 You, madam? 
 No. Just... 
 And your passport? 
 It's with his. 
 There's only one passport. 
 I'm sorry, there's not much time left for check-in. 
 You really must decide now. 
 Hello. That's lovely, thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Did you see Gavin bought the white Evoque in the end? 
 Don't mind the Evoque. 
 Yeah, but white, though. 
 Jason, can we get two coffees up here when you've got a minute? 
 Of course, Captain. 
 Thank you. 
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain Paul Spencer speaking. 
 Welcome aboard this City Dart flight to Paris. 
 Flying the aircraft today will be my colleague Stuart Donaldson. We're just a little bit behind schedule, waiting for a couple of stragglers. As soon as they're on board, we'll push back from the stand. Don't give them angry looks for making us late, they are, in fact, honeymooners. Love is in the air. At least it will be shortly. Thank you very much. Let's do it. (Passengers clap) So sorry. Man : Congratulations. Congratulations. OK? Enjoy. Thank you. Cheers. I can't believe we made it. Five-minute flight delay but they're in the air. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again. Very sorry for the delay but not to worry, the wind is right behind us, so we should have you in Paris on time. Say what you like about Farage, though he has a point. They're building on green-field sites next to Saskia's school because we've run out of houses. We're a small island, we're full up. I've lost speed. What? I... don't have a speed reading any more. What's that vibration? That's the auto-pilot. What's it doing? You'd better pass me control. (Beeping) (Passengers gasp) (Engines roar) We're climbing, Captain. I know we're bloody well climbing. Put her in a dive. We need to regain... I know the f*cking stall procedure, Stuart. It won't... Keep pushing forward! Disengage autopilot and auto-throttle. Autopilot, auto-throttle disengaged. Symmetric Thrust. Verify. Both engines looking good, throttles are together too. (Beeps from instrument panel) OK. (Exhales) OK, we're back in control of the plane. What the hell just happened? Why is it still vibrating? I don't know. Shall we divert? Er, yes. We should divert to, er, Le Touquet or back to Ashford? Ashford's probably nearer. Well done, Paul. That has never happened before. This is CDT718. We urgently need permission to divert to Ashford. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain. You may have noticed things are a bit bumpy at the moment. Apologies for that. We're experiencing some minor technical difficulties. Air traffic control :  CD T718, we have a block for you at Ashford. Anybody else up there got a visual on CD T718? Man :  Yeah, Control, this is MKZ79. We see him. That was some crazy stuff he went into there. It looks like he's back in control. Control :  OK, CD T718, you need to maintain height now. Captain :  Solely as a precaution, I have requested... Oh, no. No, come on. What the f*ck is going on? We're climbing. Put out a mayday. We're losing speed. Do something! (She yelps) Keep pushing forwards with me. Can you reach the manual trim? I can't control it! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday. CDT718. We've lost control of our instruments. It's like somebody else is flying the plane. No, no, no, this can't be. We're gonna reach coffin corner. Oh, no! (Groans) Hold on, hold on. (Screaming) (Yelps) We've stopped climbing. Are we going up or are we going down? We're going down. Captain :  Stuart, don't let it roll! (Shout drowned out by engines) For God's sake! Dad, something just fell out of the sky into the sea. Maybe it was a shooting star. Control :  What's happening, MKZ79? Do you still have a visual on CD T718? Man :  Control, this is MKZ79 . He's hit the water, hard . They're gone . Call Coastguard Emergency Rescue and Recovery. Plane down. Bearing Rescue 512, Roger. Request weather conditions on scene. Roger. Weather is... wind, 220 at 15 knots. Visibility eight miles Request you commence search of immediate area for survivors. We will update Search and Rescue. UK Coastguard Rescue 512, located debris in the water. Rescue 512, Roger. Does it look like aircraft? UK Coast can confirm looks like aircraft. Rescue 512, Roger Rescue 120, proceed to scene to investigate. Woman :  The tide's dispersing the debris fast along the coast. The weather's worsening too, so get a shift on here. (Exhales) (Helicopters whir) Terrorism? We don't know yet. The pilots requested a divert which would suggest it's not. What's he up to? Oi. Argh! Get off me! (Groans) That hurts. What were you doing? Eh? Were you making a little film? Let him go. f*ck off. (Groans) What are you, some kind of paparazzi, are you? Gonna put it on Lucky Leaks? Karl! Let him go! Give everyone a good laugh, eh? Do you want to see what it's like to be a body in the water? I'll show you what it's f*cking like to be a body in the f*cking water! Karl, stop it! f*ck off, you piece of sh1t! Karl, you need to stop it! You f*cking piece of sh1t! You'll lose your job! f*ck off. (Exhales) That beautiful boy. It's such a waste. (Phone clatters) We don't need the south European girls any longer, they're too expensive. It's cheaper to use the Calais supply route and provide the passports ourselves. I'll call you later. (End-of-call beep) So... it is done. Yes, we saw. Everything you need is in there. Send my greetings to Koba. Tell him, er... we're just getting started. (Gasps) (Toy dog yaps) (Continues yapping) (Click of button and yapping stops)
