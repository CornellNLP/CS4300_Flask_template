 Adam? 
 Adam!

 Armed police! 
 Clear! 
 Guys? 
 Chuks? 
 GPS coordinates. He's giving us a location! 
 Okay... Vicarage Lane... about 10 miles from here. 
 That's Adam's, I think. Some kind of... negative ions thing. 
 Maybe he's put it there to show us where he was. 
 Yeah. Trouble is, Kieran wants us to know where he is. 
 Argh, what are you doing with my son! 
 Think of what he wants you to do and do exactly the opposite. 
 Why hasn't he left us a message? 
 That's part of the torture. 
 Karl... you can't lose focus. 
 I used to work with him. 
 Okay. 
 And why is he...? 
 He's a man who lost everything. 
 All his 'truths' stem from that. 
 His real name is Kieran Ashton. 
 Why is he doing this to us, Karl? 
 I slept with his wife. 
 When they were living in France, she came to me to talk about his... decline. 
 We only... 
 Anyway, he knows. So now he feels betrayed. 
 By... society, by the police... 
 And by his friend. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay... he's toast. 
 Not French toast, sadly, but you can't have everything. 
 This is his last hurrah. 
 Well, that's a very poor way of putting it when he has your son as a hostage, Karl. 
 Yeah. 
 We will be doing everything we can. 
 I can't stay on the case. 
 Obviously, I'm too close to it now, so... 
 I have to put my trust in you guys. 
 Yeah. 
 I think that's probably the right thing to do, Karl. 
 Yeah. Absolutely. 
 We will keep you informed of any developments. 
 Yep, yep. 
 I don't understand. 
 Well, she going to take me off the case anyway. 
 How do you know? 
 Never mind. 
 Sorry, I just want to say one more thing. 
 I think everyone should know this. 
 Sorry, Andrea, it's just... ah, it's not random that he's picking on me and my family. 
 A few years ago he was... I was looking after him on an undercover operation, investigating human trafficking. 
 And he was pulled off that case for political reasons that were... questionable, to say the least. 
 Karl. 
 Anyway... I slept with his wife... 
 Ah... er, when they were still married, and living in France under a new identity. 
 And, er, I recently discovered that he found out about it. 
 Er, I haven't said anything up to now, out of, um... er... er... embarrassment, so... 
 What's embarrassment now, then? 
 Okay, um... Europol and Interpol have been informed... 
 This is a straightforward manhunt. 
 Has TT been in touch with you? 
 I'd tell you if he had. 
 Yes, but now that you're not on the case anymore you might not want to tell me everything. 
 Ah, no, I just told Andrea that to get her off my back. 
 Why wouldn't I tell you everything? We're together in this, aren't we? 
 Right. 
 What are you gonna do? Report our conversations? Tell 'em what I'm doing? 
 That's not what I said. 
 For me, the most important thing is to find Adam. What is it for you, Elise? 
 Gold stars for diligence beyond the call of duty, or... or... winning your bloody game with TT that you keep going on about? 
 Are you just trying to pick a fight? 
 I don't know, Elise. 
 You gonna give me a fight? 
 I don't want to. 
 Why don't you tell me how you think this bloody game of yours is gonna end? 
 You want my honest belief? 
 No, no. Sugar the f*cking pill, as usual. 
 I won't change for you, either. 
 Good, I'm glad to hear you have a choice in the matter. 
 Do you just want to insult me, or do you want an answer to your f*cking question? 
 I don't know. 
 I think TT aims to kill Adam eventually. 
 But he may not if we get to him on time. 
 And I'm sorry because I can feel the pain it's causing you. 
 I just want to find my son. 
 Why are you doing this to me? 
 Has everything you've ever known turned out to be wrong? 
 People that you expect to help you let you down? 
 Authorities that are supposed to protect you, don't. 
 Friends, that you trust with your life... betray you. 
 Boo f*cking hoo. 
 Why don't you take it up with the ombudsman for self-pity? 
 You have you dad's mouth. 
 Wonder if you have his morals as well? 
 So all this is just about some beef that you have with Karl? 
 Some 'Truth Terrorist'. 
 No, you're wrong. No 'truth' was more or less important than any of the others. 
 You called him Karl? 
 Yeah, sometimes. So what? 
 I had a son once. I don't think I'd have liked him to call me by my first name. 
 Well, what happened to him? 
 He was in a car accident. 
 I was talking to his mother at the time. 
 The phone remained on in the car. 
 I heard it all. 
 That's terrible. 
 I can't imagine. 
 I don't need to imagine. 
 Hi, Dad. 
 Well, well... This is a rare treat. 
 Skimmed milk, I'm afraid. 
 How's the blood pressure? 
 Not bad. 
 I have to avoid booze, salt... watching Gideon Osborne on the telly. 
 Doing some volunteer work for the bird observatory on Sandwich Bay. 
 That's good. 
 Lots of migrants arriving now... whitethroats, swifts. 
 You should bring the kids down. 
 Hmm. 
 Been following your case, of course. 
 Saw you on the telly once. 
 Bloody madman. Terrorism's not the answer. 
 I'm sure he'd have built the Vanguard Party of the Proletariat if he'd only had the time. 
 Can I take a look at granddad's pistol? 
 The Spanish Civil War one. 
 You said it was for me after you die. 
 I did. And Adam after you. 
 I'd like to borrow it now - show it to someone. 
 Who? 
 A firearms expert - special interest in military history. 
 February, 1937... 
 Battle of Jarama. 
 Half the Fifteenth Brigade died that day. 
 A Comradeship of Heroes. 
 Who'd die for a cause these days? 
 There are plenty of people, just not your cause. 
 It was yours once, too. 
 Don't really have the temperament for causes, do I? 
 You can tell me. 
 I know we've had our differences... but you can talk to me. 
 He's taken him. 
 He's taken Adam. 
 He's taken him from me, Dad. 
 And we're running out of time. 
 Excuse me? 
 Ah, excuse me?! 
 What the hell do you think you're doing? 
 'Ground Zero'. 
 Get out of here! 
 I'm not interested in how he ordered his material, and I'm not interested in your useless category of English and French. 
 Well, no offence love, but I'm not interested in whether you can build the Sistine Chapel out of f*cking matchsticks! 
 I warned you. 
 Understand? 
 I'll know what I'm looking for when I find it. 
 You better know what you're doing. 
 Whoa! 
 Careful there, Sir. 
 Firearms will be here any moment. 
 I'd make myself scarce, if I were you. 
 You were tapping my phone... and my computer. 
 Only following orders. 
 Sir. 
 "The News of Today..." 
 "Stephen Beaumont..." 
 "What good are old people?" 
 "A world gone mad..." 
 "Inequality before the law." 
 Bon. 
 No, you don't need to do this! 
 Yes I do. 
 Don't worry, it's just going to put you to sleep... for a few moments. 
 I don't want to go to sleep! 
 Ssh... 
 No, no, no, no, no! No! 
 Ssh. 
 When you were Becky... you wanted me to get on with my dad again so it would make it worse for him, right? 
 You didn't make me love my dad again... 
 I always loved him. 
 His ki.... 
 His... kindness... 
 Throw away your usual mobile. 
 Where's my son? 
 Throw away your mobile. I don't want the police to be able to track you. 
 I'll do anything you want to save him. 
 I'll kill myself if that's what you want, Kieran. 
 Ha! Get rid of your mobile, or you will never hear from me again. 
 He will search for you... endlessly. 
 But you will be gone. 
 Just a ghost... in the clouds. 
 What time is it? 
 Morning. 
 Why were you sleeping in your car? 
 Um... to be ready. 
 We have leads on places he might use. 
 My house... My house is near Bordeaux. 
 There are fig trees in the garden and, um... hirondelle. Long tails... came back each spring, to make their nest. 
 Swallows. 
 I stand outside the house and look at it. I push the front door open. I walk up the stairs... into every room. Setting down things I want to remember. Until I get right to the top, to the attic... where we used to sleep as children. 
 Is she there? 
 Your sister? 
 She's with me. She... She shows me where things are. We're nearly ready to go back to where we began. It's all set. 
 I'll send you text messages to guide you along. 
 I've gotta go. 
 Karl! 
 I've gotta go alone. 
 Please don't go! 
 Let me go! 
 Where are you meeting him? 
 I can't tell you. 
 
 
 
 Karl! Where are you... 
 Stop! 
 That way! 
 Get the dogs in here! 
 Has he burned it? 
 I can't see any corpse. 
 We've got something. 
 There's something in the main house. 
 Downstairs! I think the dogs have got something. 
 The corner! 
 It's here. 
 Where's my son? 
 You f*cking lunatic! 
 Tell me, or I'll blow your f*cking head off. 
 The first time we fought, I was a bit disappointed in you, Karl. 
 I thought I'd give you an advantage. 
 Quite a stage we got here. 
 CCTV everywhere! 
 I imagine we'll have company pretty soon. 
 What happened to you, Kieran? 
 You happened to me. 
 You should never have taken me off the case. 
 Let my son go. 
 I trusted you with my life - you should have protected me. 
 I did protect you! 
 You'd have ended up dead. 
 You knew I was onto something big. 
 Too big. That was the problem. 
 Do you know... what it was all about? 
 I didn't then - I do now. 
 I worked for Peloton in the end. 
 After taking my identity, they recruited me in France. 
 How ironic is that? 
 More sad than ironic. 
 Well, their logic was sound. 
 Somebody was gonna enslave other humans, why not choose? 
 Control... tax that somebody. 
 'Cause it's not what we do. 
 No... 
 You just destroy other people's families. 
 I didn't destroy your family, Kieran. 
 They were f*cking terrified of you. 
 That's why they were driving to England. 
 I heard her screaming for me from the car. 
 How are you gonna make up for that? 
 Well, kill me then. 
 Take the gun. 
 Take it. Kill me. 
 Let my son go. 
 Here! 
 Kill me! 
 Spare my son! 
 Please. 
 Here they come! 
 You don't have long, Karl. 
 If they arrest me, I promise you will never find out what happened to your son. 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 Good. 
 This is where it ends, Karl. 
 Well, we're hoping to get someone down there, yeah... 
 There is no risk to the ventilation shaft itself, they understand their instructions. 
 Just a moment. 
 He's got Karl down there. 
 Yeah. The only problem is that it's Karl, who not only is the one holding a gun, but now he's pointing it at us! 
 Karl's a possible target as well, now. 
 And Ashton tipped off the press. He's stage-managing the whole thing so everybody can see his 'grand finale'. 
 I have to talk to Karl. TT knows it's over. 
 He's going to goad Karl into killing him. That'll be his final victory. 
 Well, that cannot happen. I cannot allow that to happen. 
 That will be tantamount to an execution. 
 Then, let's at least deny him the publicity and shut down the CCTV. 
 We're ready to move. Over. 
 The press'll scream cover-up. He's got his own feed, anyway. 
 Can I go talk to him? 
 The final declaration from the man known as the 'Truth Terrorist'  in which he announces that his campaign is at an end. 
 "My final truth is about the betrayal and lies that keeps us in a pit of corruption." 
 Oh, look... here comes your little friend. 
 You can drop the gun now, Karl. 
 She hasn't abandoned her colleague and run away, has she? 
 Where's Adam? 
 You can drop the gun. We found Adam. 
 She's lying. 
 He was in an old Peloton property. 
 Fabien Vincent told me where it was. 
 Is he alright? 
 Yes. 
 He's gone, Karl. You've lost him forever. 
 We found him. 
 And he's alright? 
 Yes. 
 Where is he, then? 
 He's in the hospital, but he's going to be okay. 
 Tell her to call him. 
 I don't need to. 
 Is he alright? 
 Yes. 
 Is he alright? 
 There was enough morphine in his body to collapse his respiratory system, several times over. 
 He survived that. 
 Are you saying that because it's true, or because it's what I want to hear? 
 Is my son alive, Elise? 
 Yes. 
 Is my son alive, Elise? 
 Yes. 
 Is my son alive, Elise? 
 Is my son alive, Elise?! 
 Karl, Karl, give me the gun. Don't shoot him. 
 Step away! 
 They'll shoot you. 
 On your f*cking knees! 
 Why should he live? 
 Do you believe in the sanctity of life, Karl? 
 Shut up! 
 Because if you don't, it makes no sense to keep alive the man who took your son away. 
 Karl. Karl! 
 This is the same thing he's always done. 
 It's the same tricks he's always using. 
 That's no truth, it's just cheap logic. 
 Right, now you really do have to choose, don't you Karl? 
 No running away with your tail between your legs... close your eyes, say it's none of your responsibility. 
 That's not how it was. 
 Karl! 
 Still a f*cking coward. 
 Karl... 
 He wants you to kill him. Don't give him what he wants. 
 Your order, Ma'am? 
 Andrea... don't do it. 
 Be smarter than him... 
 Don't give him what he wants. 
 Don't give him what he wants! 
 Karl! 
 Argh! Argh! 
 No! 
 Argh! Gaa! 
 Argh! 
 Where's Adam? 
 He's in the hospital. 
 Argh! 
 He won't have suffered at all. 
 "For she remarked to Tom now that never before this summer had she dreamed of the garden so often." 
 "And never before this summer had she been able to remember so vividly what it had felt like to be the little Hatty." 
 "To be longing for someone to play with and for somewhere to play." 
 Elise is here. 
 Okay. 
 The swallows are back. 
 Think it's true he couldn't burn him? 
 Yes. 
 But I'm also sure he won't speak about it. 
 Mute and blind. 
 He will only ever see shadows. 
 Think how far they've come. 
 All the way from Africa. 200 miles a day, apparently. 
 A hazardous journey... for such delicate creatures. 
 I'm gonna leave the police. 
 After the trial, I'm gonna find some... decent journalists and tell them about... the case Kieran couldn't investigate. 
 About how he lost his identity, how he lost his... sanity. 
 About Peloton. Everything. 
 I just don't want the press to turn this into some kind of... sexual jealousy story. 
 It was never that. 
 No. I'm gonna tell the truth. 
 Elise, are you staying to eat? 
 We've got tons of tabasco. 
 No, thank you. I just came to see if Karl was okay. 
 As you see... 
 Bye, then. 
 Au revoir.
