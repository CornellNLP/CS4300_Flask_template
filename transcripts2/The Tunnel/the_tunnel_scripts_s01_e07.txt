 TT just posted, his fourth truth is about to begin. 
 Distorted voice :  The news was meant to be front page... but you didn't listen. We admire people who act. 
 He made those bastards cough up millions. 
 Charlotte Joubert paid the money. 
 Take me to bed. 
 Why did she do that? 
 Don't ask me. 
 (He screams) 
 Adam stayed here last night. 
 Did you have s*x with my son? 
 Did you sleep with her? 
 Get out. 
 Kids, can you hear me? 
 Kids : Yeah. 
 Okay. Have you all got your PE kit? 
 Kids : Yeah. 
 Because if you haven't, Mrs. Brooks says that she's going to bake me in a pie. 
 Is that a Mr. Rashid pie? 
 A Mr. Rashid pie. Yeah, very good. 
 What other pies are there? 
 Cucumber pie! 
 Cucumber pie? That's terrible. 
 Pie pie. 
 A pie pie, what's that? A pie in a pie? 
 Wow. That sounds lovely. 
 That sounds really nice. 
 (Children chatter) 
 Where's he going? 
 (He groans)

 (Phone rings) 
 Bonjour. Good. You are in France already. Can you come to the station? I'm with the car that he was seen escaping in after he shot Delgado. It's a police car. I'll be ten minutes. Hi, it's Laura. I can't take your call, please leave a message. Hi. It's me again. Um, just... I know you're angry, um... I'd just really like to come home tonight. Give me a call. The car was hot-wired,  but the witness said the gunman wore a service uniform. Everything now points to TT being one of us. The hacked UK Police server, the uniform, the car, his gun training. Who said the car was hot-wired? The Gendarmes' helicopter made routine contact as he drove it from the scene. I spoke to the pilot this morning. He said the driver used police code perfectly. It explains a lot if he's police. They found a surveillance camera in the barbershop where Delgado was held. It's the same kind used by the DCRI, French MI5. We need a shortlist of all our men who fit the profile. If he's one of us, he shot three colleagues. He's French then. Because he spoke French to the pilot and none of you learn languages? I was thinking more because we watch each other's backs in England. (Phone rings) Girls, breakfast! At a café. Yay! McDonalds! (Music plays) (Phone rings) (Muffled speech) Mr. Rashid? Sir? Mr. Rashid, please... Guys, are you all right? I want my mummy. This is where it happened. Does the driver have a phone? They found it in a ditch a few yards further on. Witness in a passing car saw a man in a balaclava, no description. They're searching the area and looking for CCTV to try to track the journey, but it's rural, so... French ex-police who fit TT's profile. We're no use across the Channel until they have a lead. We should go and see Delgado's widow. We think TT's police and he was too, so they might have known each other. (Siren wails) Olivier said you got thrown out. I cheated on Laura. She needs time. Does she know you don't believe in monogamy? I do believe in it. You cheated. Have you ever been in a relationship? It depends on the definition. It's not sleepovers with 18-year-olds. No, you mean children and a house with one woman and s*x with another. I don't expect you to understand. I understand. (Engine drones) You want to have your cake, eat it and f*ck the baker too. So you told her that you cheated? She knew cos of you. You told her that I went there on my own. Where? Charlotte Joubert? That's who you had s*x with?! Leave it. What was it like? That's not really the point, is it? The point is that Laura knows. So you're saying, the problem isn't that you cheated, it's that you got caught? The problem is I don't want to lose Laura. Look, you... Do you know them? I need to go to the toilet. Okay, guys. Don't cry, listen. Come in. Okay. It's just a different kind of lesson. It's like a PE challenge. Yeah? And when you free yourself... you win a prize. Yeah? Whatever it is, Jonno, I don't care. In my office, Hillier. Er...maybe you haven't noticed, but I seem to be packing up. He burnt a girl to death in front of me. I...I am done. What's the matter? You worried for your own skin? You're a c**t, Jonno. There, see? There's the Dan-Dan that I know and love. Office! Well, I don't know what you are going to do, Jonno, because I think I just told you I quit! Advance from the newspaper group for a book on TT. And a nice fat cut to us here. You've hit the big time, sunshine. What, you're telling me you've had an epiphany? Take the f*cking contract. Here he is. Distorted voice :  Millions of children are used every day by companies who make the luxury goods you buy. But do you ever question what the real cost is? How many children are exploited? You don't care because they're not your children. But now they are! If you do nothing, they will die. But you can save them. Show your rage towards the companies that sell these trainers. If I can hear you and see it loudly enough, these two girls go free. Yes, he said the blue tiles. Well, tell the client he can call me and then... Okay. Yeah. No, fine! I'm coming now. You are joking. Does anyone drive an old green Saab? Do you actually own a driver's licence? Move your car! Oh, seriously? You want to waste some more of my f*cking time. Today's already sh1t and I'm late. All right, there is no need for that kind of language. Can you just move your car? I am sorry. I parked really badly. I am late for a job interview. And when I went inside they'd already given it to someone else. What do you care? You've got yourself to worry about! (Engine drones) Oh, God. Reporter :  Police are under increasing pressure in the hunt for the so-called Truth Terrorist, following the abduction this morning of five Kent primary school children and their bus driver. There are still no clear leads, in this, the latest act in his escalating campaign of violence. Right. UK police who fit the profile. There's seven of them. He's got MS. He's in a wheelchair. (Phone rings) Hello. He's dead, so... Unless he's very bloody clever. Okay. So we haven't got a clue which way he went. We have helicopters up but he probably hid the bus before we even knew about it. This is the final truth, this is our final chance to catch him, and we have nothing! I am so sorry, really. I thought you had room to get out. I'm sorry, too. What kind of job was it? Oh, you know, Prime Minister. No, it was my own fault I was late. I was caught up watching the news this morning about those kids. What kids?! You didn't see? The Truth Terrorist captured a bunch of school kids on a school bus. Which school? Weston Grange Junior, I think. When did the world become such a shitty place? Well, I'm sorry, again. And for ruining your day. 
 
 (Explosion) Where's that? Paris. Kids. Pull your hands. Quickly! (Applause) You think this is good? You applaud him? Children being saved from death seems pretty good to me. You don't think killing kids is the worst thing he could do? No. Children are just smaller human beings. But they work on people's emotions. Like kittens. English one's gone up. Good. Distorted voice :  I hear and see you. So now two children are free. Here's one more. And another target. Show me your rage and the boy will live. Where the hell is that? Some kind of warehouse? Where? Eight miles from here. Find out who owns it and the connection to children. It's okay, there's nothing... There's nothing to worry about. Try the door. That's it. Pull it as hard as you can. Pull the door as hard as you can! Pull it! (Sirens wail) (People shout) Police are trying to maintain order, but tension is rising. As yet, it is not established why this particular... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The building's owned by a conglomerate of companies but they can't find any links to sweatshops. So now he doesn't even tell the truth?! It doesn't matter, does it? Because they bought into child exploitation for the first one, so now they just believe it without question. Stay back! (Shouting) Stay back! (Siren wails) What if the kids are in there? Move it! Police, police, police. Has anyone checked inside? We were told to protect the building. Stay back! You go up. Back here. Shocking scenes of aggression. There's no-one in here. Wait. Look. Nothing. Hey, it's not safe. All right. Okay. You need to get out! (Shouting) (Mechanical whirring) Pull your hands. Pull your hands! Come on. Yeah, good, Theo. There's a laptop. Careful, Jay! It's us. Is the kid free? Well, from his restraints anyway. Maybe he was trying to torch the bus for evidence. Maybe he was trying to prove how he could get the Great British public to burn alive five children. He's changed. He misled us. We need to work out why. To make us look like w*nk*rs, I expect! Stop! Police! (Phone rings) Saw you with the mob. Have you turned vigilante or are you back on the payroll? It was scary. They were unhinged. Welcome to our readership. So you've decided to take the money, then. Okay. Cecile was assaulted at ZP Holdings by some heavy and his friend. They got away. Great. We're getting nowhere then. Any idea what his point is? He's just shown us a weakness. He isn't hidden by his politics any more, he's shown us that he's angry. He wants to make us feel and act out his anger for him. (Static sounds) Distorted voice :  The last two children... Bring me the computer over here. Bring it here! Just as you make choices every day which effect children all over the world, now chose who you want to save. One child will live. The other will be executed. You choose. He doesn't seriously think anyone would vote on that?! No-one will vote! He hasn't shown them how anyway! What's the news on those searches? Come on! We're going round in f*cking circles here. (Bell rings) Hi, Laura. Hiya. Hello, sweetie. How are you, darling? Come on. (Text alert sounds) Right, let's get Billy. And how was school? I'll sign the contract. I'll call you back. I'll write the book, then I am out. f*ck it. Hey, Laura. Hi. So I guess my dad's an arsehole, huh? You threw him out? For now...at least, yeah. I guess he's just having a hard time with everything right now. Yeah. (Kids play in background) Yep, got it. Three more farms are clear. The internet's going mad about those kids. It's trending off the scale. "What about the African kids?" "He should be strung up and get the death penalty." Why do people feel the need to comment on every single online article? Same reason TT's doing this. They want to be heard. I thought you said he was angry. No. Look at this. "Boy's mum is on benefits. Save the girl. RIP, little boy." They're voting?! Mr. Rashid... what's happening? (Mechanical whirring) What have we ever done to you? Please? Come on, move. Get out of here! Go! Mr. Rashid, help me. Stay behind me. No! No! No! No, he can't. He can't! Oh, f*ck. What the f*ck is that meant to prove? Are we meant to think he's kind or something? Cal, hurry up! Quickly! (He pants) No! (He gasps) God. f*ck! Distorted voice :  These children are ruined now. Their innocence is gone. But this is what you do to children every single day. When will you see them? When will it stop? Riley Farm. It's further out than we thought it was. Can't tell us anything. Anwar! Why can't I see my son? (She cries) So that's it then, folks. The final truth and he's still free. And now he'll disappear! (Phone rings) Yes? We have Adam Roebuck down here for you. Okay. What do you want? I just came to get some clothes. See the kids. They're asleep. And Adam's out. See the news today? See what happened? I love you. Hey. I, er... How are you? I'm working. What are you doing here, Adam? Well, I figured you'd be in England, cos of what happened today. Wondered if you fancied having a drink. I could come to yours? Your father was not happy that I let you stay last time. So? Who cares what he thinks? I do. Night, Adam. How long are we going on like this for then? (Text alert sounds) Who's that? School mum. Bye, then. (Door closes) Is this where Adam slept then, yeah? He came to see me at the station today, asked if he could stay again. I said no. Well, thank you. Look, I'm sorry I blamed you about Laura. Hug? Embrosse moi? No. It's all right. You just asked me to brush you down. Ah. (Phone rings) Distorted voice :  It's over, Danny. Five truths. I'll give you an exclusive interview before I give myself up. What?! But you have to meet me now. How do I know that I can trust you? I could've killed you in your car, Danny. I didn't. (Dial tone sounds) Dinner. Bon appétit. It's actually very nice. (Knock at door) This is Gael. Sometimes we have s*x. Hi. Hi. I should leave you two to... No, we have work to do. Okay, I'm on the coast road. Where to now? Distorted voice :  Do you see the look-out point? I need to find my earplugs. I can't sleep when someone else is breathing. (Computer alert sounds) Danny : Okay. So what happens now? Karl? It's from Cecile. She found this. Gym membership? Of ZP Holdings' director Marco Brun. Fabien Vincent, French police suspect. It's the same guy. It's the same guy. What?! No! No! Please! Please come back! Please! Wait! f*ck! f*ck!
