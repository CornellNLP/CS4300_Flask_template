 Distorted voice :  There is no equality before the law. That is my first truth. 
 Stay away from my sister. 
 It's only cos of her you're not face-down in the harbour. 
 Why all the hostility? 
 The man you were with outside... You must not talk to him. 
 I don't like it here. 
 You don't have an alternative. 
 You're in danger from that man. 
 Distorted voice :  I have chosen you. 
 I want people to know why I'm doing this. It's him, it's started. What good are old people? They do not produce, so we leave them to die alone. (Sirens blare) The confirmed death toll is 14, but police are warning that this may rise. I'm now joined by Assistant Chief Constable Gerry Bryant from the Unified Crime Directorate. Assistant Chief Constable, if this  is  the work of the killer who left two victims in the Eurotunnel, then we are looking at a serious escalation. Yes, although as yet, we have no confirmation to that effect. But I can assure the public that we've drafted in... All the victims have the same morphine-based painkillers. What about the driver? No, usual blurb. He's clean. So, if the drugs were contaminated, it was done elsewhere and they were placed on the van. I've come to see my sister. I've told you already, just one visitor at a time. Here he is. Voucher Man. Sorry, pal. You missed the mouth-to-mouth and chest massages. Will you have this man removed from this room? He probably caused this. Yeah, course I did. Who did she phone? Who did what was needed? I saved her. You couldn't do that. You can't  do  anything. You'll be surprised what I can do. Security, room 306. Stephen, just... Just go. Just...go and come back when... Stephen... Stephen... Stephen! Number four. There we go. Harriet Stone. Same drugs, no symptoms. How did she remain immune if it was a poison batch? Woman :  She's not deaf. Why don't you come in and talk to her? So, is it a good book...Harriet? Hmm, a little sad. Is it? Yes, but that's all right, I like sad. Yeah, sad's all right, isn't it? Yeah. In books anyway. And tunes. Hmm, yes. So, what else? What else can you tell us about Susanna? She's not happy. No? Why not? I don't know why, I just know. She gives you your medication? For all the good it does. Yes. Are you French? Yes. Oh! I'd love to go to France again. (Phone rings) But I never will. No, the journey would probably be too difficult for you now. Yep. Susanna Beaumont's in hospital. Oh, poor Suze. She has a lovely reading voice, you know? I don't understand your point. She said herself it was unlikely she would see France again. And you agreed? Yes. But maybe she didn't want... I'm sorry, do you think she will see France again? No, but that's not the point. Why didn't you just say, "You'll be in the graveyard soon, Grandma." Because it's not what I was thinking. Sometimes you just need to say the right thing. Police. Never say never, that kind of thing. That would have been a really dumb thing to say. Okay. Susanna Beaumont. She's sedated, still in a lot of pain. And there was a bit of a scene this morning with her brother. What kind of scene? An ugly one which left her very disturbed. He struck a nurse before leaving. What's his name? Eh, it was Stephen Beaumont, he's the official next of kin. Did he bring her in? No, she was on her own in the ambulance. Where is she now? Er, in a side room. So, she ate the same poison as the old people? Yeah, but she's younger and fitter, so her body's better able to deal with it. It doesn't explain how it got there, does it? She's through there. Don't try and talk to her. Do you think she did it? Poisoned 14 old people and then tried to kill herself the same way? No. Given the fact that it was an opiate-based pain relief, I think she was stealing Harriet Stone's medication. Safely back in the arms of Sister Morphine. "Dear Stephen, how is..." Dear Stephen. "How is school? Mummy says you hate it and cried when she left you. Remember, I love you more than anybody. Your sister, Suze." She never sent it? No. Okay, let's take a look at her flat. Chuks, run a check on Mr Stephen Beaumont, would you? ♪ Venez dans mes bras ♪ 
♪ Closer to me, dear ♪ 
♪ Donnez-vous à moi ♪ 
♪ Set aside all fear ♪ 
♪ Restons enlaces pour l'éternité ♪ 
♪ Yes, you shall be mine ♪ 
♪ Till the end of time ♪ I don't know what Stephen's going to do with us? He brought us to this dirty cottage and... You have to help me, please. I want to leave, I want to go to London. I need money...quickly. Where are you? What part? I don't know. Phone box, it's red. There is a field with two horses. And what colour are the horses? Um, there is one brown... and the other one is black with white spots. I'm joking, babe. What street are you on? I-I can't see any signs, there's nothing. Where the streets have no name... near a horse. That's why I don't normally travel the countryside. I see, there is a pub. We passed on the road. Um, the Fox and something. Hounds? Firkin? Hare? Hounds, and the house is on the same side of the road, just a little bit further. Okay. I'll search through the middle of nowhere on my GPS. An afternoon of playing Fox and Hounds gets you a train ticket to London. Some extra pocket money to visit Buckingham Palace. I don't know why... I've never done this before, I don't know how... You'll be fine. Just go with the flow. I'll do the introductions. You make sure the kid's not around now, yeah? Don't even let him see me. Last number called from her mobile was to Anthony Walsh. As in...? Gemma Kirwan's pimp. And not the only string to his bow. He's stated slinging a lot of meth recently, I hear. Yeah, not to Susanna though. We think she was stealing drugs, not buying them. Anything on the brother? Stephen Beaumont, no fixed abode. Works for some charity helping asylum seekers and the like. "And the like?" Don't start, boss, I haven't even had breakfast yet. Anyway, he's out of the country. Where? Don't know, just heard the funny ringtone on his mobile. Probably in Romania, rounding up a few more he can bring over to help. Phone the charity, find out when he's due back in the UK. Get him to give us a shout. Cool. I put things in rooms. Fine. It's just a simple memory device. How does that work? I have this imaginary house in my head. With many rooms. I put things I want to remember into parts of the house so I know where to look for them. Oh. Sometimes when I can't sleep, I walk through it, look into each room. What does it look like, your house? You have to make your own house, otherwise it doesn't work. Is it based on a real house? So what were the cops like? There was a French detective, she was a bit weird, but you would. And then the English one and he... He really didn't like me. No... Oh! Little bit more respect for your golden goose, please, Johnno. I mean, TT did choose me to communicate with. TT? Yeah, "Truth Terrorist". Came up with it last night. Good, hey? Yeah, we should perhaps be a little careful about glamorising the mad b*st*rd. Oh, yeah, that's a strategy that's going to boost our online hit-rate. Look, we've got an in with one of the biggest news phenomenons in years. Yeah. (Phone rings) Yeah? Distorted voice :  Danny. My second truth has only just begun. Nobody cares about people who made sacrifices, worked hard, or served their country. Once society no longer needs them, they're abandoned... to slow and lonely death. What, so you're doing them a favour? I mean, no offence, mate, but how do you know they weren't happy sitting in their own piss and watching Bargain Hunt? I mean, who appointed  you  judge of what their lives meant? Look, you said that your second truth has begun? Good. You listen as well. This is not just a problem in Britain. Okay, so? Soon we will see how much old heroes are cared for in France. (Phone beeps) (Taser fires) (Man groans) I know you paid for a bit of rough and tumble but...don't take it too far, yeah? Couple of slaps. Bit of verbal, no air locking. And go easy on Tina, yeah? It's got a kick to it. Come on. Woman : No. No! (Woman sobs) Mr. Beaumont, this is DC Chuks Akinade of Northbourne Police. Could you give me a call when you're back in the country? The policy of the department store is always to press charges. However, in the light of her age and the fact that this is the first time... It was a mistake. Try, "I did it because my friends bullied me into it." She hasn't got any friends. The top was the wrong colour anyway, sweetheart. You need something to draw attention to those lovely big eyes. I get them from my dad. All right. Well, just don't let me see them round here any more. So tell me what my punishment is? Apart from having to live with you and not Dad. (Door opens) Don't be scared. He's a nice horse. That's it. Oh, he'll like that. There you go. There's a good boy. Eat up. Where you come from? Where's your mummy, sweetheart? (Sobbing) (Crying) Is everything okay? It's just... I just thought he shouldn't be in the field on his own like that. (Door closes) Hello, Karl. Jean-Claude Delplanque. 76 years old, retired soldier. Appeared online two hours ago. 76, in good shape. Better than the English victims. Who identified him? Catherine Leclerc. A coordinator from one of the soup kitchens that works with immigrants in the port. What does he do there? Drinks soup, talks to the immigrants. Why him? He'll have a reason. It looks like he's in an old industry unit. We've got helicopters with thermal-imaging equipment searching abandoned buildings in the industrial zones. Where does he live? Forensics are there already. Have a look around and talk to the neighbours. Even the internet. He will soon have the audience he needs. Mm?  Pardon? Tough guy style. No bed. 
 
 Catherine Leclerc. You're the woman that identified... Où est le chien? (Phone rings) Someone may have seen the abduction. Communist Party of France. I put my house on it. Because he works in a soup kitchen. Yeah, well, not just that. Spot them a mile off. We used to go L'Humanité festivals when we were kids. (He sings in french) Okay. Finder's keepers. (Dog barks) Here's our only witness. Anyone speak his language? Parlez-vous anglais? He was still on his leash when Jean-Claude got tasered. Yeah. Probably within a 5-meter range. Do either of you have a comb? No. That's a long shot. No. It's an AFID tag. The dog must have run off before he had a chance to get him. That's good. (Dog groans) That's very good. He's made a mistake. That's very good. (Helicopter engine drones) (Door creaks) TV :  While inevitably people have drawn comparisons with the Unabomber, whose letter bombs killed three people in the United States. I'm joined now by psychologist and academic Miriam English. A very simple question... Why is he doing this? Yeah, go on, Miriam. Give us the lowdown. Payday for the experts, eh? Why aren't the girls in their bed? I sold them on eBay. Good move. They're in our bed. You can thank your eldest son. Why, what's he'd done now? He showed them that web bite with the kidnapped man, so obviously now they're too scared to sleep in their room. (Knock at door) What's up with you? What's up with me? What are you playing at? Showing Hannah and Maya all that scary stuff? Everyone's watching it, everybody's talking about it. It's reality. Everybody isn't under ten years old. I didn't show it to them. They just came in here bothering me as usual and then they saw it. Well, you should be more careful. It might take me a while to learn your parenting skills. (He sighs) That journalist you mentioned, Danny Hillier. Everyone's reading his stuff. Great. Calls him TT. The "Truth Terrorist." People are talking about what TT's doing. The thing about justice, the old people. You can say what you like, but it's better than chatting about all that celebrity sh1t. Well, right now I'd rather that Hannah and Maya's reality was a little more anthropomorphic fare. What? (Phone rings) Peppa Pig. Keep them away from your computer. Is that Elise Wassermann? Can I say  bonjour ? Chuks. When? Right. I'll come now. (Phone rings) You were stealing Harriett Stone's painkillers. Is she all right? Yeah. Thanks to you leaving her in agony while you fed your habit. My life was such a mess. I used to be somebody, you know? I used to do PR for film stars. Most of them are right c**ts. Some of them are all right. I didn't care, just... parties, drugs and clubs. I remember the smell of it. People used to call me Sexy Suze. I f*cked film stars in toilets. But like all good things... Don't laugh at me. I'm not laughing at you. So how'd you end up? Things just started to go wrong. Is my brother here yet? No. Are you close to Stephen? Does he know where you were? Why? Just curious. He wants to save the world. Does he? Uh-huh. Stephen told me about his eyes. Whose eyes? Do you know where Stephen might be now? I was sick. Sick-sick because of the blood on the fish. They were hitting their heads on the bottom of the boat. That's enough. ON PHONE:  His wife was away. He ended up with some guys in a flat whose address he can't remember. And when he woke up... I see where it's going. So, no idea? He honestly can't remember a thing about it: the alcohol, drugs, s*x... And it all happened a year ago. You checking the bar's CCTV? Yeah. High hopes? No. Susanna Beaumont was awake. I managed to speak to her. Anything interesting? I don't know. Okay. I'll speak to you in the morning. What are you doing? Making dinner. Hospitals at night, eh? What? Strange places. I like hospitals at night. They're...completely their own thing. Does that make any sense? Yeah. Enjoy your dinner. Ah, morning. Any chance of a coffee? Put that euro you found in there. Anything off the bar CCTV? No. I tried that house of memories thingy. Didn't work. No? No. Got lost in the laundry room. This might come as a bit of a shock to you, but I suspect our inner landscapes differ quite significantly. Well, I hope so. Will you tell me about your house one day? No. Thought not. (Policeman speaks french) (Door creaks open) What's that? He's in there again. There's two of them. Look into the camera. Look into the camera. Show us your face. Show us your face. Or get out of there. You know who else must be watching. Two kids? Maybe that will take the shine off the Truth Terrorist. Excuse me. (Mobile phone rings) Disguised voice on phone :  Good, you received a new phone. You don't want the cops listening. These conversations are just for you and me. I suppose I'm flattered. So? What do you want me to tell the world? Ask me a question. All right. What happened when the feed went dead? Who were the other people and why did you go offline? Next question. Is the man still alive? Yes. Why five truths? What, are you just going to stop after that? We are a long way from that point still. What do you want? What is all this getting you? Closer to the truth. We're all getting closer to the truth. So...what's next? The old man I'm holding can be saved. Use your newspaper to tell people that. He can be saved. How? How? (Beeping) Oh, hey, Sophie. How's it going? Fine. Good. Is my dad here? He had to go to sea, he's, erm, got a new ship that he had to... Come sit with me a minute. You can't keep turning up like this every time you have a row with your mother. There's a custody order. Because Grace doesn't want to see me. You have to understand her too. She feels I prefer you to the little ones. I'd love to have that feeling. Um...Tom's only four. Jamie's only nine months. Compared to them you're a big girl. Almost a grown-up. I can stay the night though, that's not against the custody order. The thing is, it's Tom's birthday party this evening and Grace's family are all staying the night. We don't have room. Come on, I know you can sort things out with your mother. You want me to drive you back? Call me if you need anything, eh? And there was a little boy in the field. Ever so sweet, he was. Didn't have a word of English. And you said the mum...? She was really strange. And it looked as though someone had just hit her. And later, when I walked past, the door was open but there was nobody there. I don't want to get them into trouble. "Live and let live" is my motto. Mine too. Well, unless they're Tottenham. I'm really worried about them. It's just not right, what goes on in there. (Revellers laugh and cajole) Sorry, love, I'm closed. Why are you standing there? What's it to you? You look cold and wet. That's because it's freezing and raining. You can't stand there. Is that rain on your face or are you crying? I was just about to have a cup of tea. There's enough for two if you want one. Van owner : Sorry, love. Ah-hah! Given up, eh? How's it going? Good. It's only been eight years but I'm confident this time. Five in my case. Well done. Yes. We all follow rules. The dog and the kids he hadn't planned on. It threw him. I know how he feels. Yeah. It'd drive a man back to cigarettes. Your French is getting better. Merci. You're leaving? Yep. I'll come down with you. I'll get my stuff. Bonne nuit. Mm-hm. I've been asked to go to Paris, permanently. Well, who could possibly choose Paris over Calais? You like Elise? In what sense? In any sense. She's a good cop. Best I ever worked with. Not everybody gets her, of course. Night. Night. Nice car. Congratulations on the Paris job. I haven't spoke to Elise about it yet. Keep it to yourself for now. I've only got green tea. That's great. Why were you crying? Family stuff. That happens. (Thunder rumbles outside) I can't go home. Stay here if you want. Here? You can sleep on the bed in there. There's only one bedroom. I sleep on my yoga mat. Really, take the bed. It hasn't been used recently so the sheets are clean. Maybe my mum will lose a bit of sleep now. (Thunder rumbles outside) Philippe! Philippe! He's back online. What happens to old people in winter? (E-mail notification bings)
