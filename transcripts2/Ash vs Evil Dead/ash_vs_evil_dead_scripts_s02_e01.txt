 Present the book to me and we'll finally end this.

 You have no idea what you're doing. 
 Of course I know what I'm doing. 
 I wrote this book. 
 Your stupid mortal toys mean nothing to me. 
 Take the deal then go back to Jacksonville. 
 I am offering you the undo button you wanted.

 Told you Ruby couldn't be trusted. 
 We've got to put our little thinking caps on and do something... 
 Yes! You know I'm in. 
 I have been waiting to kick her ass. 
 Yeah, amen to that. 
 But how, Ruby could be anywhere? 
 I know where she is... 
 Ruby is in Elk Grove, Michigan. 
 That's my hometown. 
 Okay, that's a very specific guess. 
 The Deadite gave it away with that song. 
 That damn song... 
 Alright. 
 We're gonna go to Elk Grove. 
 We're gonna find Ruby and I'm going to bury that Kandarian Dagger deep into her strangely beautiful neck and kill her where she stands. 
 We'll be back in Jacksonville by Friday.

 Alright. We need a sketch of her to show the people in town. 
 Pablo? 
 I'm on it. 
 So, uh, why so long since you've been home? 
 Oh, who drank all the beer?

 No, this is my house.

 Yeah, I get the idea. 
 How you been, pop?

 Nothing. 
 Can't a guy come and see his own father?

 Bullshit. Looks like some piece of crap made in China. 
 Kelly : What was that gun shot?! 
 Alright, put down the guns! 
 What is going on? 
 You got a green card kid? 
 Kelly, Pablo, meet my father. 
 Whoa. Filthy and fine. 
 Brock Williams. 
 But you can call me Cock. 
 He's your father alright. 
 Um, I thought you said your Dad was dead. 
 Dead? He's the one that died. Not me. 
 Uh, we were sort of dead to each other. 
 What have you done now? 
 Nothing. We're just looking for someone. 
 Pablo... 
 I drew most of it while the car was moving, but... 
 What? You're looking for Bigfoot? 
 It was a bumpy ride! 
 Okay, you know what? Forget it. 
 You don't want to help, that's fine. 
 Some things never change. 
 Oh, still the victim with you, huh. 
 Always somebody else's fault. 
 Somebody else made you go to that cabin. 
 Somebody else chopped your hand off... 
 Ah, no, I did that. 
 Somebody else killed your girl. 
 No, I did that too. 
 Come on, Dad, you know exactly what happened. 
 Why didn't you set those people straight? 
 Because you should have. 
 Instead you let 'em beat you down and you ran away with your tail between your legs. 
 Thank God your mother wasn't here to see that. 
 I did what I had to do. 
 Ashley, it's taken me a long time to get my life back together. 
 I think it's best that you and the "illegal" here just leave. 
 Kelly, would you like to have dinner with me?

 Right, honey? 
 No. 
 Can you give us a second? 
 Sure. 
 Mm, mm, mm... 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 You've got some huge balls showing your face in this town. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Notice I never wear gym shorts. 
 I'm here on business, looking for a woman. 
 She's bad news. 
 If I don't find her, you might actually have something to do around here. 
 Well then, let's find her for you. 
 Everyone, this is Ash. 
 Some of you may know him as Ashy Slashy, because he went crazy and chopped up his friends. 
 Okay, that's not true. 
 I did not go crazy. 
 I knew exactly what I was doing when I chopped up my friends. 
 And now, Ashy Slashy is back in town looking for a new woman. 
 So, what do people think? 
 Should we help Ash find another victim? 
 Or should we kick him back to whatever rock he was hiding under? 
 f*ck this sicko! He's got to go! 
 Yeah! Get him out!
