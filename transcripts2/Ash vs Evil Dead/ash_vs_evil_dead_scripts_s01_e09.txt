 [Pablo grunting] 
 [growling] 
 There must be some spell I can say to undo all this. 
 Eli : You have to bury it deep below the place where your journey began. 
 [Deadite grunting] 
 Ah. 
 [screaming] 
 [Fisher choking] 
 [Deadite Lionel grunting] 
 [speaking softly] Just keep on breathing, okay? 
 I've been wanting to umm... get closer to you? 
 [in Australian accent] Well, hey there! 
 [in Australian accent] Hello. 
 So are you two together or...? 
 Nah, he's got a girlfriend though. 
 [both yelling] 
 [grunts] 
 Amanda, what the hell happened? 
 Your hand,  grew another you. 
 [Other Ash yelling] 
 [Ash grunts] 
 Lookin' for me? 
 Time... to... 
 Time... to... die! die! 
 [eerie music playing] 
 What the f*ck? 
 [whispering] Is goin' on? 
 [wind howling] 
 [Kelly gasping] 
 [grunting, banging] 
 [both yelling] 
 Son of a bitch! 
 [grunting continues] 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Two Ashes? 
 Easy kids. 
 No need to jump the gun here. 
 Yeah, yeah, don't shoot the wrong guy, dummies. 
 Oh, you buyin' this shiny turd? 
 This is the guy who killed Fisher. 
 Come on, take him out! 
 I did not! 
 That guy killed Fisher. Take him down! 
 Well of course he's gonna say that, he's a murderer. 
 Pablo, amigo,  just kill the guy and I'll get you  a piñata or whatever. 
 [speaking softly] Subtle racism? 
 [speaking softly] But not that subtle. 
 Hey, hey, I'm a racist, too. 
 Asian babies creep me out, but, unlike Mister Imposter here, I know stuff about your past. 
 Stuff that only you told me. 
 Pablo, till you were nine, your best friend was a kitty cat. 
 Notorious C.A.T. 
 Anybody can figure that crap out! 
 Kelly, when you were in junior high school, you told me you busted a stained glass window of a church. 
 By accident. 
 Then you punched a nun in the face. 
 Ha-ha. 
 [grunts] 
 She was being so dramatic about that stained glass, and she hit me first. 
 Okay, look. Just shoot us both. 
 What? 
 Yeah, it's the only way. 
 That way this ass-wipe is dead, and I don't have to deal with this horse sh1t anymore. 
 Ho, ho, ho. 
 [laughing] Come on. 
 All right. 
 [guns cocking] 
 Oh, oh, no, no, no! 
 [grunting] 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 [creaking] 
 [wind howling] 
 Okay, how'd you know it was really me? 
 Well, first off, you're racist, but not against Asians. 
 Well, why would I be? 
 They give such incredible massages, with those teeny hands. 
 Also, you tried to take the easy way out. 
 Total Ash move. 
 What? Come on. 
 The only person you're willing to lay down and die for is you. 
 Well, that's because I'm very important to me. 
 Yeah, we definitely shot the right one. 
 I'm reconsidering. 
 Still, I might've given my life for her. 
 God, we would've made such a handsome couple. 
 So, how did that happen? 
 My asshole hand. 
 It came back, grew another me. Same sh1t, different day. Things were goin' fine with Amanda too, but that went south. All because of that goddamn book. No disrespect. You were the one who read from it. No disrespect Kelly. If you live in the past, you hurt the future. Now this Book has some freaky weird power. The sooner it's six feet under, the better. First we gotta deal with these bodies. We can't have Hot and Sexy comin' back to ruin our day. And I say that with all due respect to her. Well, brains before beauty. [Ash grunts] Brad : Hello! [suspenseful music playing] [wind howling] Aw, sh1t. We got company. Happy campers comin' at ya. Hello? Ah, hey. Ah, what are you guys doin' here? Brad got us lost. [laughs] It wasn't my fault. Uh, the-the trees, they, uh, you know it's like the trail map just stopped making sense. Uh, uh, can we crash here maybe? [Ash laughing] In this tiny cabin? No, no, no, the three of us here, we, we kind of fill it up to capacity. Plus there's a few dead bodies in there. Dead animal bodies. [stammering] Right, because maybe, we're veterinarians, ah, really bad ones. We specialize in a very radical form of surgery. Or we're just hunters. I think the point is, there's no room at the inn. So you guys might just have to beat it, sorry. But, ah, but-but maybe we could, ah, just camp in the front yard? [chuckles] Can you give us a second? That could work. Okay, look, there is no way in hell they're gonna stay here, 'cause they're gonna get possessed, then they're gonna be on the night train to Kill-adelphia. With stops in Choke-lahoma City, and Die-ami. Nice. I thought you'd like that. Oh, hey, sorry to break up your moment,  but we can't just send them back into the woods. Who knows what else is out there? It's a hell of a lot safer out there than here. And you're just worried about the little sister. [whispering] Guns, and a chainsaw... Yeah, I am. Her name's Heather, and she's super cute. [scoffs] I don't know much else about her. That's all you have to know. Okay, look. You two are gonna take 'em the back way to Elk Rapids. Man, what back way? There's a trail right up behind the cabin, [Pablo sighs] goes to civilization, then get your asses back here 'cause I need ya. In the meantime, some of us have to slice and dice. [mumbles] Good luck. So... change of plans. [animals howling] It's cool of you guys to show us the way out of here. Oh yeah, well, anything to get out of a house of dead animals, right? [Heather chuckles] Listen, I know you're not hunters, or veterinarians, not normal ones anyway. What are you guys up to? What? Uh, we're gettin' you and your family to Elk Rapids. Okay, fine, it's a secret. You know what? If you didn't have a girlfriend, I'd find a way to get it out of you. Whoa. What do you mean "girlfriend?" Well, I heard you were seeing someone. [chuckling] From who? From, from her. Is it serious? I'm not sure. [snarling] [leaves rustling] [suspenseful music playing] [Heather gasps] You okay? Yeah. [rustling] [Kelly sighs] Chopping up my evil clone. Maybe someday that'll feel weird. [chainsaw revving] - ♪ Just the two of us ♪ [Ash grunting] ♪ We can make it if we try ♪ 
♪ Just the two of us ♪

♪ You and I ♪♪ [chainsaw buzzing] [eerie music playing] [growling] [blood splattering] Maybe I should mount this on the wall. [growling continues] Book : [in deep voice] Ash... Ash! f*ck me. To bury me is a mistake. No. No, we are not having this conversation! You should use me. No, I already did that dance, made my life a living hell! Only because you're trying to fight me. Stop fighting. Admit it, you're not all good either. Be smart, for once. Use me. No. You're takin' a dirt nap. Ash, if you bury me, you stop being a Superman,  and go back to being a stock boy. No! Yes! No, not this guy. I've got possibilities. To do what? Have a family? Become president? Get rich? None of that's ever going to happen! I'm what makes you special. Blah, blah, blah. Play's over, Shakespeare. [sighs] Amanda, I'm sorry for, what I must do to you. Promise I'll be a gentleman and respect your modesty, while I cut you into small pieces. Well, maybe just one last little peek at those... [suspenseful music playing] sh1t! Amanda?! [crickets chirping] You know what? I like the forest in the fog. It kind of glows. Yeah, day or night, there's always something beautiful out here. Even if it's hard for some people to see it. Hey, I voted for Lake Havasu, okay? So, Heather just told me that I got a girlfriend? That's weird. Yeah. She said you told her that. I did. Why? I don't think she's good enough for you. [indistinct chatter] What's wrong with her? Come on, you know how crazy  girls can be. Yeah, I'm learning. Look, Pablo, I'm sorry, okay? But it's not a good idea to get involved with someone right now. What, why? Because life expectancy is real short out here. And I don't wanna have to deal with that aftermath, and neither should you. That's not how I wanna live. [growling] [Heather gasping] [suspenseful music playing] [leaves rustling] Watch out! Stay back! What is it? What is it? [screeching] [Pablo grunting] [screeching continues] [Heather gasping] [Kelly panting] It was just a... raccoon. - Ew! Brad : Guys, guys. What the hell? You know, it-it makes for real good eatin'. I've never heard that before. Oh, yeah. Makes a real robust and savory stew. Ah, we should keep movin'. Come on. [leaves rustling] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on! Hang on! Let's look before we leap this time, huh? Get outta the way, Brad. Excuse me, but my husband works in forestry, and I think you should listen to him. He needs to stand clear of the trees, all right? Why, so you can shoot another innocent animal? [Melissa gasps] [all screaming] 
 
 [suspenseful music playing] [in deep voice] Hello, pussies! Ash was supposed to chop you up! Guess he can't do anything right. No, no, no! [Deadite Fisher laughing] No, no! [Kelly yelling] [guns clicking] No! Oh, sh1t, sh1t! Oh! [Deadite Fisher grunting] [screaming continues] Kelly : Oh, God! Oh, God. [Brad grunting] [screaming] Oh, my God! Kelly : Put him down! Drop 'em! Why, is that what Ash would want you to do? [gasping] Oh, God. "Hello, I'm Pablo.  I do whatever Ash wants me to do!" "Ooh, ooh, ooh, hi, I'm Kelly! I do whatever Ash  wants me to do, too." "Hello Kelly,  do you love me? 'Cause I love you!" [Deadite Fisher laughing] "I love you, I love you, I love you!  I love you, I love you!" [laughing continues] Shut up! Shut up! [Pablo and Kelly yelling] [Deadite Fisher laughing] Get off! [screaming continues] No! Ah! [hissing] You're next, hot stuff! [Heather screaming] Pablo : Leave her alone! [Kelly and Pablo gasping] [Deadite Fisher snarls] [suspenseful music playing] [Heather panting] [wailing] [gasping continues] [panting continues] [twigs snapping] [Heather screaming] [Deadite Fisher growling] [Heather screaming] [Heather screaming] [screaming] [screaming] Before you die, I want you to know, there is no heaven. [Deadite Fisher grunting] [Heather yelling] I'm gonna peel the skin off your pretty little face! Get away from her! [shrieking, grunting] [bones cracking] [snarling] [panting] Oh! It's time your loyalty to Ash got rewarded. [Deadite Fisher grunting] [Pablo grunting] [whistling] [woman grunting] [Deadite Fisher growling] You! [Pablo gasping] [whispering] Amanda. Ruby. Ash did this to me. Don't trust her! She's lying! The truth. [Deadite Fisher shuddering] The truth is... we could still be together, if you want. [speaking softly] Well I'd like that. [heart beating loudly] But our time has not yet come. [Fisher whimpering] [Heather screaming] Ow! [gasping] Did you really have to do that? Amateurs. Who the hell is that? Uh, my, my leg, I... [suspenseful music playing] [snarling] I'm almost done. [Heather panting] This isn't real. It can't be happening. I wish you were right. Better tell Goldilocks to shut her baby blues. This fairy tale's about to get real bloody. [crying] Oh jeez, just stop it! What are you doing? It's okay. Listen, we gotta chop 'em up... [flesh ripping] [Ruby whistling] or else they could come back as somethin' much worse. Nothing is worse than this. [whispering] Trust me, everything is worse than this. [Ruby grunting] So who the hell are you, and what do you want with Ash? I'm the one who's gonna stop him turning more people into monsters. What the hell are you talking about? Ash doesn't turn anyone into monsters. He fights them. [Ruby laughs] Yeah, he's the only one standing in their way. [speaking softly] And me too. I stand in their way all the time. Oh, yeah. He fights them, all right. He's still got that book, hasn't he? Necronomicon? 'Cause you know that, Uh listen... [panting] Amanda was my friend too. It doesn't matter what Ash's intentions are. [flesh ripping] As long as he's got that Book... [Pablo gasping] a trail of dead bodies is gonna follow. So take me to him. [door creaking] [wind howling] [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music playing] Whoa! Why the hell are you on this property, and where's the book you stole from my family? Easy, Nancy Drew. What hell are you guys doin', sellin' tickets? She's a Knowby,  and she saved us from Fisher. Well, mm, not all of us. Okay. All right. Well, number one, it's my book, has been for 30 years. Number two, I'm on your damn property, 'cause I'm here to save a little somethin' I call "Earth." You know what I've been doing these past 30 years? Cleaning up your messes so they don't destroy  a giant thing that everyone calls "the Earth." And what have you accomplished in all these years? You put a chainsaw on your stump? Congratulations. You know, it's a lot harder than it looks. Name one other person you know that has a functioning chainsaw arm. This has to stop. You've got The Necronomicon, So where is it? None of your beeswax. I will tell you this though, pretty soon it's gonna be six feet under. Oh, you're gonna bury it? Bet your bippy. I found that out  during a drug fuelled trip. So, your entire plan to save the world comes courtesy of a bong hit? No, I didn't smoke the drug, lady. I drank the drug, I'm gonna bury it in the basement, then I can finally say to evil, "Hey, evil, why don't you eat my butt?" Wonderful imagery, but it won't work if you just bury the book. That's what my vision says. Then your vision is stupid. Yeah, you're right. It is kinda stupid. Almost as stupid as your stupid face. [Ash yells] [Pablo gasps] Just say one more dumb thing. I'm gonna say a lot of dumb things. [both grunting] That didn't work. Okay, okay, kids! Break it up, all right? Just everyone take a deep breath, okay? Look. If The Book is just buried like before, then some other fool, like you, can come along and use it. For The Necronomicon to be laid to rest,  it has to be dismantled. Destroyed. Impossible, tried it. With what, your peashooter, and your-your power saw? [chuckles] Don't talk bad about Mo and Larry here. They've served me very well over the years. Sure, they can kill the body that evil inhabits, but that spirit just keeps comin' back, doesn't it? Maybe. Yeah, you see The Book,  and the evil that surrounds it,  really aren't affected by such things. No, you gotta use this. [suspenseful music playing] Kandarian Dagger. I know what that is. Yeah, so why don't you show me the book, and we'll finally end this. I gotta talk to my peeps. [speaking softly] All right, guys. What do you think? Okay, well, she did save our lives, and I think she smells kinda nice. Although I haven't showered in a really long time, so I'm probably not the best judge. I don't know, I mean,  if I've learned anything from you, Ash, it's that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, and also she doesn't smell that nice. Man, making decisions is so hard. Let's look on the bright side, we're balls deep in this sh1t. There's nowhere to go but up. Yeah, up sh1t's creek. Without a paddle. [growling] [eerie music playing] Okay, you have to use the Kandarian Dagger to deface The Book. Literally, rip the face off the binding, and once you start, you cannot stop, no matter how difficult it gets. Don't stop till the facelift is done. Got it. Okay, Book. It's gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me. [groaning] Ash. [thunder rumbling] Yeah, I forgot to mention this thing has become quite the Chatty Cathy. Not for long. Ash! [dramatic music playing] No! Please! [groaning, gagging] [thunder rumbling continues] [sighs] Oh, Jesus. [Ash sighs] Okay, now what? Now present The Book to me. Then the power of ownership will be mine, and the ritual will be complete. Sounds simple enough. What's wrong? Ah, nothin'. Then why'd you stop? Well, I don't know, it just, should I say goodbye to it or what? With The Book defaced, time is of the essence. Yeah, yeah, I got that, but after all we've been through? Ash, you have carried this burden for 30 years. Isn't it time you let someone else take the load? Just let her take your load, Jefe. Just finish it. [suspenseful music playing] Okay, fine. Sure. Yeah, take it. Chorzem, kumaarizma, uwarizim aratta. [groaning] [thundering] Fa raga shi ta, lucera gai suckra. Ishtar dumuzi, Akah Mannah! [light buzzing] [wind howling] [Ruby continues chanting in foreign language] I don't think I like this. Vara ashitar,  bara anasa iktanar. Whede sighonor. Haratar! [boards creaking] [shrieking] [whispering] What's happening? [Ruby continues chanting in foreign language] [growling] There's somethin' fishy with that book. [Ruby continues chanting in foreign language] [growling continues] Sherbo livarnar! [gasping, screaming] Pablo! Pablo! [gasping, screaming continues] Pablo! [Book growling] [Heather screaming] Help me! Oh, my God! Help me! Oh, my God! Get it off him! - Kan draw, ecru-em, finitum! Ruby, gimme that book! You have no idea what you're doin'!
