 Oh, no. My jam. 
 Man, this is more embarrassing than the time I caught you watching "The Notebook." 
 He wrote her a letter every day. 
 I challenge you not to cry at that. 
 Why are you here? I thought you were supposed to be in the city tonight with your friends, like, all day. 
 Like... until 11:30? 
 Man, I tried. They're boring. 
 Always the same conversation. 
 "Buck, where's my money?" "Buck, give me my money." "Buck, don't run. I know where you live." 
 Say what? 
 Anyway... I see you got a party coming down the pipeline. 
 Uh, it's not a party. 
 Just more like a boring work thing. 
 I'm trying to get in with this group from the office. 
 They get all the best projects. They're kind of the A-team. 
 And you want to be the Mr. T, 'cause you're the only black guy. 
 I got you, 'cause this party's gonna be off the chain! 
 [Laughs] Yeah, yeah, or it could be  on  the chain. 
 Or, better yet, no chains. 
 How you gonna be Mr. T without no chains? 
 You smart about some things, and you dumb about others.

 Buck absolutely cannot be here tonight. 
 You did tell him it was a work thing, right? 
 I said the word "work" twice. 
 I really don't think he knows what it means. 
 [Sighs] That's the one four-letter word he  won't  use. 
 This is bad. Buck and my job just don't mix. 
 If I can get on this team, it'll really help me make my mark. 
 But if Buck's around, he's gonna burn my chances with a blowtorch and a bottle of Crown Royal. 
 Both of which he has in his room. 
 Mom, I'll go to your banal sorority mixer this afternoon, even though I am morally opposed to exclusionary organizations. 
 I'll tell you what she's not opposed to... a thesaurus. 
 Clearly. 
 And can you please tell Maizy to stay out of my makeup? 
 Don't hate. 
 Alexis, I thought you didn't like that sorority. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 This alumni chapter is filled with successful women that could help with my foundation. 
 I thought I'd pop over and then come back for the party. 
 I'm ready. 
 Uh, does no pants mean you don't want to go? 
 You only said dress shirt. 
 You did not say anything about pants. 
 I can't read minds, you know. 
 I think you can. What am I thinking now? 
 I'm gonna go get some pants on. 
 Tia, go help Maizy with her face. 
 Honey... 
 Did you see the makeup? 
 I saw the makeup. 
 Check it! For the party, I got Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor on vinyl. 
 That will slap the nasty right into that crowd! 
 You hear me? 
 No slapping, nasty or otherwise. 
 Oh, my gosh! 
 Buck, I totally forgot I have tickets for Ipix tonight. 
 Ipix? Is that the place where you can eat coconut shrimp and watch the movie at the same time? 
 Exactly. What do you think about taking the kids during the party? 
 White people serving me coconut shrimp while I watch a movie? 
 Hell yeah. 
 That's what Dr. King fought for. 
 Huh. 
 Aw, there you go, Buck. 
 You are a genius. 
 [Chuckles] Yes, I am. 
 I'm gonna go get those tickets. 
 I'll go get Buck Maizy's coloring book on Dr. King. 
 [Laughs] 
 So, what chapter are you from? 
 Oh, um, Epsilon. 
 We just moved to Chicago, and I just wanted to reconnect. 
 Oh, well, you know... Once a soror, always a soror. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Smoo! 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! 
 [Both laugh] 
 Girl! 
 Okay, I'll be in the car. 
 Tia, don't be rude. 
 Theta Sigma Nu promotes tolerance, charity, and sisterhood. 
 Is that Alexis Smith? 
 Oh, God, not  that  bitch. 
 Holly! 
 Together : Hi! 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Wow. 
 [Chuckling] Wow. 
 Mommy, why are you using the "sistah girl" voice? 
 Hush, boy. 
 I didn't know you were in Chicago. 
 Yeah. God, I haven't seen you since college. 
 I'm so glad your face finally cleared up. 
 So, these must be your adorable children. 
 Oh, yeah. This is Maizy and Miles and my oldest... Tia. 
 Well, these are my children... Jason and Jen. 
 Hi. Well, you know, kids, your mom and I went to college together. 
 She was our chapter president at Spelman. 
 And I'm the chapter president here, too. 
 Oh, well, look at you go! 
 Oh, let's look at me. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Oh, kids, your mom was so cute back then. 
 And sturdy. 
 I think we even had a little nickname for you. 
 There was no nickname. 
 Oh, there was. We called her "Mascot." 
 And you used to do the silly little dance. 
 Do you remember? 
 No. There was no dance. 
 Oh, do the dance, Mascot. Do the dance! Do the dance! 
 Do the dance! 
 Mascot, you have to do the dance. 
 I would do the dance if there was a dance, but there was no dance. 
 Wait till we get home. 
 So, what brings you out of the woodwork? 
 I run a nonprofit for at-risk teens, and I just thought maybe the Thetas would want to get involved and help a sistah out. 
 That sounds interesting. 
 Though we really prefer a sister to show a little commitment before adding to the agenda. 
 Well, what can I do to show that I'm committed? 
 Family lip-sync battle? 
 Why? Just, why? 
 It's their big fundraiser. All we have to do is show our faces, pretend to sing, and get on the agenda. 
 It's not like we have to win or anything. 
 Good, 'cause someone said Holly's family has won three years in a row. 
 Holly said that a  lot. 
 Let's just try to enjoy this, guys. 
 The flier says it's funky-fresh family fun. 
 What you just said makes me want to funky-fresh walk into traffic. 
 Honey, the party seems to be going well. 
 Mm. 
 Ooh, Peter's really packing down those crab cakes. 
 Uh, he's in for about a pound of the jumbo lump. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I've got him just where I want him. 
 Watch me work. 
 Work it, baby. 
 Another seasonal microbrew, Peter? 
 Well, I shouldn't, but I absolutely will. 
 Come on, now. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, be real with me. How do I get on the team? 
 Well, you are one of the three candidates being considered. 
 But, you know, if you really want to seal the deal... 
 [Door opens] 
 ...all you have to do... 
 Guess who's back?! 
 No. No! 
 Ah, ha ha! 
 What happened to the movies? 
 There was an incident. 
 Yeah, I had a, uh, coconut-shrimp-eating contest with Maizy... 
 And I threw up a little. 
 And I won... a lot. [Laughs] 
 Okay, kids, I think it's bedtime. Let's go. 
 Yeah, y'all go. Come on, come on. Go and get in bed. 
 So, B-Buck, uh, you want to help Alexis with the kids? 
 Oh, no. Y'all need my help here. 
 Give me a bottle of tequila so we can turn up! 
 [Laughs] 
 Pete, this is my brother Buck. 
 Buck, this is Peter. 
 You like to get liquored up? 
 Sure, yeah. 
 [Hip-hop music playing, crowd chanting "Buck!"] 
 If I get it in the cup, somebody got to take their top off! 
 [Crowd "Oohs"] 
 [Cheers] 
 I'm lookin' at you, Sheryl. 
 Oh! 
 Hang on. You don't have to do that. 
 Uh, can somebody get Sheryl some coffee? 
 You okay, Peter? You look a little squirrelly. 
 To be honest, I chased all that baked Brie with the Crown Royal your brother gave me. 
 It's not ideal. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Buck can be a little over-enthusiastic. 
 No, he's awesome. 
 Hey, this is the most fun I've had since my divorce. 
 Yeah, I'm just gonna redirect you here, Peter. 
 You were mentioning some tips about getting on the team? 
 Uh, right. Yeah, just talk to Diane. 
 She's the decision-maker. 
 Diane. I've only seen her in the hallways. 
 Is she approachable? 
 Well, she didn't come to your party. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, tomorrow night, we're going to the Bulls game. 
 Yeah, uh, company's got a box. Diane will be there. 
 You can ride with Buck. 
 Buck? 
 You've already invited Buck? 
 Hey, look! 
 Who wants to see me jump off the balcony in the pool?! 
 [Cheers] 
 Oh, I would very much like to see that. 
 [Music continues] 
 You crazy, Big Pete. 
 I got to clock back in, Big Pete. 
 All right, Pete. 
 That was Pete. 
 I gathered. 
 Hey, um, you sure you want to go to the game tonight? 
 I mean, you'll be kind of out of your element. 
 What?! Basketball, free booze, them little, tiny hot dogs? 
 Seems like my element to me. 
 These are my colleagues, Buck. Not some dudes from the bar. 
 Are you saying I'm not good enough to hang with your work friends? 
 No, I'm saying it's a professional situation, not the rebirth of Freaknik. 
 Hey, I brought it last night. 
 What you brought was chaos. 
 I found a bra in the microwave, and Eric peed off the roof! 
 Hey, you should be thankful. 'Cause if it wasn't for me, we wouldn't even be going to no basketball game. 
 Do me a favor. 
 What? 
 Just stay home. 
 I don't work for you. 
 Technically, you  do.

 Wow. Looks like you guys are having a good time. 
 I kind of am. 
 But do not post this on Facebook. 
 Too late. 
 And some of the comments have not been kind to you. 
 But they love my moves, though. 
 Really? 
 You looked like you were just flapping your arms to me. 
 Maizy, are you trying to say that Miles ain't good enough to be in a contest with you? 
 I bet that really hurts your brother's feelings. 
 Miles : I don't care about her opinion. 
 I've seen her eat a dog biscuit. 
 I think what Maizy's saying is, Miles is invading everybody's space and should stop flapping his arms and stay in his own lane. 
 I'm being misquoted. 
 Miles, do your thing. 
 If she don't like it, she don't have to go to the Bulls game. 
 Okay, guys. [Claps] Let's take a five, okay? 
 You two, over here. Please. 
 Now, I don't know what's going on with you two, but you're stepping all over my funky-fresh family fun. 
 Talk to him. 
 No, talk to  him. 
 No! Neutral corners. 
 Hey, Mom, that Holly lady from your sorority tagged us in a video. 
 Where? 
 Crowd : [ Chanting ]  Go, Mascot! 
 [Laughter] 
 Go, Mascot! Go, Mascot! Go, Mascot! Go, Mascot! Go, Mascot! 
 You lied. There was You look like a broken puppet. I was just having fun with my friends. Oh? Where are they? Behind the people pointing and laughing? You don't know fun when you see it. Go, Mascot! 
 
 Okay... Wow. I was awkward, pudgy, and wore Hammer pants way past Hammer Time. But it was a flattering cut on me! I was mad when you sold your Hammer pants at that garage sale. Baby, she made college miserable. She wrecked my self-esteem. But I am not "Mascot" anymore. I am a strong, confident woman, and she  cannot  bring me down! That's right, baby. Rise above. We're gonna win that lip-sync contest, and then I'm gonna beat her ass with that trophy. And I'm ready for tonight. Let Buck bring his little circus to the game. I'm gonna blow Diane away and get a spot on that team. 'Cause, baby, you know what? I got a few moves ain't nobody seen. Ooh, please, Hammer, don't hurt him. Wait... Is this happening? Oh, yes, it's happening. Uh! Oh! Uh! Oh! Honey, oh! It's Hammer Time. Yes! [Air horns blaring, crowd cheers, organ playing] Whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop! When I say "Chicago," you say "Bulls." Chicago! Bulls! Chicago! Bulls! Who is that energetic gentleman? Oh, Diane, that's, uh, Will's brother Buck. He seems fun. Oh. Yeah, good old, fun Buck. But, uh, speaking of fun... Booyah! I got Bulls fever, baby! No, I think you have an  actual  fever. It's a pretty severe rash. What? No. This is "B" for Bulls. Huh? But I sweat a lot. That's an overshare. Uh, anyway, we were all supposed to do it. Did you get the e-mail I sent you, Peter? Oh, I have a very aggressive spam filter. Okay, this was a fail. But, Diane, you see I'm not afraid to be bold. "B" for bold. God, I wish I had that "B." Uh, anyway, I know if I was on your team, I'd bring a lot to the table. Hey! Look! I'm over here  on  the table. [Laughter] Unh! E-Excuse me. What are you doing? Not showing off my runny chest rash. Now give me some space. Downtown! [Cheers] I know what you're doing, Buck. You're showboating. But guess what. What? I got a bigger boat.

If this is what you guys do after 8:00 p.m., I'm sticking to my bedtime. I thought we didn't care about winning. I thought we were just having funky-fresh family fun.

You hit Sheryl in the head with a bottle. We  bot  made mistakes. But I think we can put them behind us. And if there's any other mistakes made, we can put them behind us, too.

Don't get pissy at me 'cause your high-class friends like your low-class brother. No, it's not about class, Buck. It's about Diane taking me out of the running for the team. She thinks you guys dating is a conflict of interest. It always comes back to that thing you do. What'd she tell you? Those were our private moments.

And sorry that I tied a knot in your Stretch Armstrong. He was a proud athlete, and you made him... do things to himself. Look, Will. Man, uh... ever since we was kids, you've been doing smart stuff and never included me. So I included myself. Oh, Buck. I never knew that. Yeah. Why didn't you ever say anything? 'Cause feelings make me feel feelings. And I don't like that. I never meant to make you feel "less than." I love you, bro. More feelings. [Groans] Oh, back at you. [Chuckles] And don't worry about Diane, 'cause I'm gonna dump her ass immediately. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? You cannot do that. Well, I'll never call her back. Won't nobody get hurt. No, Buck.
