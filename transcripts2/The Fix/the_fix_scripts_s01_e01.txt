 FEMALE REPORTER: 
 It's been eight long months,   
 and the trial that's divided the country   
 - is nearly over. 
- They're back.   
 Mega movie star Severen "Sevvy" Johnson   
 stands accused of stabbing his ex-wife, Cassandra Johnson,   
 and her friend Nancy Weeks to death nearly a year ago.   
 The London-born actor took Hollywood by storm   
 and became a fixture in American cinema   
 until the brutal murders that shook Los Angeles.   
 Although famed attorney Ezra Wolf   
 tried to sway the jury with an aggressive defense   
 that painted Johnson as a victim   
 of racism and police misconduct,   
 fiery prosecutor Maya Travis fought back   
 with powerful evidence of Johnson's guilt.
