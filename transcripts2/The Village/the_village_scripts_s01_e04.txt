 I'm pregnant.    
 You told his mother?    
 I was standing up for you, Katie.    
 That's what a mother does.    
 Where do you think I'd be if you'd given me up for adoption?    
 I think you'd be loved somewhere.    
 You're Cooper's wife.    
 - Yeah, he's dead.

 [THUDDING]    
 Looks like they set a court date for about a month from now.    
 I think, and again, I'm not really a lawyer yet, but seems like your best case... our best case might be to argue that Sami, who is an American citizen, would suffer undue hardship if you were deported.    
 That's not the case, that's the truth.    
 I know that, but if there's family willing to take him, I'm thinking it's harder to make that argument.    
 That's it, I'm coming up there.    
 Sami's father has a drinking problem.    
 He has no custody, just supervised visits once a month.    
 And your former in-laws?    
 If they are willing to financially provide, that hurts my case?    
 I don't really know how much the court digs in, but, I mean, yeah.    
 Okay, I will talk to them.

 Yes, well, I don't believe that, but I like this...

 We brought you some rooibos leaf.

- Tones the uterus.     
 Thank you.     
 It was our hope that our "gift mother" might be willing to pump.     
 - What? 
- Milk.     
 We'd pay for all the supplies, supplements, placenta pills.     
 I'm sorry, what was that last one?     
 Placenta?     
 It increases milk production, regulates hormones.     
 - If you... 
- Eat it.     
 Okay, um, this was great, but I have to go to school, so, thank you.     
 Katie.

 It means you can't go to art school.

 I was thinking that if maybe you could sign some statement that... is indicating that you are unable or unwilling to be Sami's sole provider...     
 We are his grandparents.     
 And you always will be, but this is just a piece of paper.

 I loved your son and I believe he's a good man.

 You blame me and shame me and still,     
 I bring your grandson to you.     
 I tell him you are a good person.     
 Don't make me a liar.     
 Save your grandson the pain of losing his mother.     
 Your paperwork was full of lies.     
 And you expect us to do the same?     
 I will be the example for my grandson that you have failed to be...     
 With honesty and by obeying the law.     
 And if you're sent away, we will provide for Sami.
