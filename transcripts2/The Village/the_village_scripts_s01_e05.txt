 I love you,  but if you ever do that again, it's over.   
 Please tell me you're not trying to pawn off your brown person case?   
 I'm just asking you to help me.   
 Get yourself right, my love,  because I have a bad feeling about this.   
 I've been looking for a job.   
 - Nursing home's hiring. 
- I'll keep you posted.    
 I don't know if I have PTSD,   
 but that makes me unfit to be Katie's father and...   
 - Nobody said you were unfit. 
- Why aren't you telling her?

 Are you in the market for a wife?     
 
 
 
 - She's got a boyfriend. 
- You didn't tell me that.     
 I already looked into it.     
 Getting married after an arrest doesn't stop her

- Maybe not, but     
 - it could help get her back. 
- How?     
 If they can prove that their union is legitimate while she's outside the country.     
 Like a mail order bride.     
 Ugh, just when I started liking you.     
 You did? [CHUCKLES]     
 Don't get excited, it was fleeting.     
 Look, this is not a silver bullet, and obviously getting deported doesn't help, but...     
 How long would it take to get her back in the country?     
 Months, years, but it's better than nothing.     
 Absolutely.
