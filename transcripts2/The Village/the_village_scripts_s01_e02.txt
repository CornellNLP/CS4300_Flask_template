 Previously on "The Village"...   
 Staff Sergeant Porter.   
 The whole building is very excited to have you, son.   
 This is the first day of the rest of your life.   
 Katie, what's been going on with you lately?   
 I'm pregnant.   
 I don't want to live there, Gabie   
 Well, what's the alternative?   
 It's a one bedroom. I got a girlfriend.    
 - There's a warrant. 
- She's legal.    
 - I know her, she's my neighbor. 
- Mom?    
 Patricia, I can't practice law yet, I'm in law school.   
 She's out neighbor, Gabe. We help.    
 So... good news?    
    years, a man can feel when something is wrong.    
 - Patricia, what is it? 
- It's just a hard day.    
 - Nick, when you meet Katie... 
- Actually, I already did.   
 I like your shirt.    
 Yeah, I have a lot of issues with war.    
 - Me too. 
- Did you tell her?    
 There wasn't really a great segue into, "I'm your dad."

 Quietly.     
 I have to represent myself?     
 Please tell me that was the bad news.     
 The bad news is that the judge's son is a New York City cop who was knifed by an illegal immigrant.     
 - Wonderful. 
- Maybe it's an opportunity.     
 He's a father, you're a mother.

 Mr. Napolitano, this is your last warning.     
 With all due respect, you're trying to ascertain the likelihood that Miss Behzadi might do something illegal.     
 A cop is an expert. Your son is a cop.
