 Previously on Being Mary Jane... 
 Uh, I'm ready for you to actually make that call for me. 
 I need a job. Something steady so I can be there for Daysha. 
 I'd say she looks pretty good considering. 
 All I see is Scar. 
 Mary Jane : What'd he say? 
 He thought you looked good. 
 Any sign of Kara? 
 Man : She said she's five seconds away. 
 Mary Jane : Kara, what the hell? 
 I told you I had that thing at school this morning. 
 It can't always be about you, mama. I'm sorry. 
 Greg sidelined me for another week. 
 I need to get back to work. 
 Just give me some time with Greg, and let me see what I can get done. 
 Sit tight. 
 Mary Jane : What? 
 Greg : We are not pulling her off the air! 
 Mary Jane : Oh, my God, I am so tired of this. 
 I am ready to come back. I want my seat back, Greg. 
 You'll get your seat back, just not now. 
 Marisol is the right face for immigration. 
 Oh, please, I can talk circles around her on all of those issues. 
 And I can do it in Español. 
 Greg : You may know Spanish, but she is Spanish. 
 I like the wordplay there, Greg, but she's actually Mexican. 
 Greg : Whatever she is, she's in that chair. 
 I've never known her to go this long. 
 Ten bucks says she gets her way. 
 I'll take that bet. 
 We'll know she lost if she walks by without making eye contact. 
 But if she does, there's gonna be some major changes in Primetime. 
 You're on. 
 Mary Jane : Greg, you' wrong. 
 You're wrong. 
 It's my show. 
 It's my audience. 
 No, it's SNC's show. 
 And it's SNC's audience. 
 All right. 
 You make my move, I'll make mine. 
 What? 
 Are you threatening now? 
 What?

 Woman : Rainbow Push Coalition. 
 Yes, can I speak to Jesse Jackson, please? 
 Man : There is simply no legitimate reason to keep Ms. Paul off the air. 
 And the longer this plays out, we have to start asking ourselves why. 
 This isn't a race issue. 
 We'd like to believe you. 
 Which is why we're here to hear you out. 
 SNC is one of a very few news outlets to make a concerted effort in presenting different points of view. 
 Yes, but your first black Primetime anchor remains off the air, and that's a problem. 
 [sighs] 
 Isn't your organization for the advancement of all people? 
 I mean, wasn't Georgia one of the few states to have its first Hispanic Push chapter president? 
 Your understanding of our organization is correct. 
 But what we also have to monitor is that corporations aren't throwing so few crumbs that people of color are not only be discriminated against but made to fight instead of align over issues of employment. 
 Well, you know, those issues are coming up in this next election. 
 SNC would love to hear your unique perspective, provide a counter for the same old election rhetoric. 
 Look, we would love more television time when the opportunity presents itself. 
 But as it stands right now, our only focus is getting Ms. Paul back on air. 
 We don't have an exact date yet. 
 Man : That's not good enough. 
 We need to lock in a timeframe, or we'll be forced to take this issue public. 
 Okay, that won't be necessary. 
 What do you have in mind? 
 We want her back on the air within three to six weeks. 
 [clears throat] 
 Let me think it over. 
 We hope your cogitation is productive. 
 Mary Jane : Look, I thought we were in agreement that I needed to be back on air as soon as possible. 
 Man : That's right. 
 Okay, well it didn't really feel like you were pushing for me. 
 And I gave you $5,000 to the cause. 
 Ms. Paul, this matter was assigned to me based on the merits of the cause, not your contribution. 
 Well, you still could have pressed harder. 
 And we will, but this takes time. 
 There is a sequential process which includes research, education, negotiation, confrontation, and reconciliation. 
 If that doesn't move the needle further, then we're up... 
 Okay, then what do we do? 
 We all just join hands and sing We Shall Overcome and hope they give us a seat on the front of the bus? 
 Who has time for that? 
 This is a process, Ms. Paul. 
 You just have to be patient. 
 Patient. 
 I've been nothing but patient.

 Female Reporter : Why was Rainbow Coalition here today? 
 Male Reporter : Are you ready for "Primetime," Mary Jane? 
 Yeah, I am ready for Primetime. 
 And I am happy to announce that you won't have to wait much longer. 
 I'll be back on the air on Monday.

 Mary Jane : Uh, yes, I'd like to reverse a charge. 
 Woman : Okay, and what was the amount? 
 Mary Jane : For $5,000. 
 Woman : Can you please hold? 
 Mary Jane : Oh, yes, I'll hold. 
 Woman : Thanks. 
 Mary Jane, you cannot tak back your donation. 
 That's gauche. 
 No, it's business. 
 Their negotiating tactics were completely ineffective. 
 Get me back on the air three to six weeks is an epic fail. 
 I could have done that myself. 
 Mark : Rainbow Push Coalition cannot be effective if most of their money is coming from institutions and big corporations. 
 Until black folk start funding our own organizations, their power will always be limited. 
 Now get off the phone. 
 I'm still taking my money back. 
 Woman : Okay, you're all set. 
 The charges were reversed? 
 Woman : Yes, they were. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Woman : You have a wonderful day. 
 Oh no, you have a wonderful day. 
 Woman : Thank you. 
 Thanks. Bye-bye. 
 You know what, girl? You are something else, I swear. 
 You know what? There's a good chance that you'll be back on the air in the few weeks. 
 I can't wait that long, that's why I went to the press. 
 Don't give me... they pushed me into a corner. 
 Has SNC given you a statement to back you up? 
 No. And this is bad for being on air. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not on air, remember? 
 Damn it, I went too far, did I? 
 Hello. 
 This is the time where you're supposed to reassure me or... lie. 
 [coughing] 
 Niecy : Grandma. I told you I would do the dishes. 
 Ooh, I'm tired of seeing these dirty dishes on my sink all day and waiting around for you to do 'em. 
 Sit down. 
 And stop acting like I'm dying all the time. 
 I just had a moment, that's all. 
 [coughing] Okay, but are you okay? 
 [coughing] 
 [deep breath] 
 Grandma? 
 Don't you say anything, you hear? 
 Okay. 
 And stop staring. 
 Okay, listen, I'll be right I'm gonna go give Treyvon this, okay? 
 I'll be right back. 
 Are you okay? 
 [deep breaths] 
 Patrick : Hey, mom. 
 Oh, Patrick. 
 I didn't know you were coming today. 
 Well, it's my lunch break, so I wanted to stop by. 
 Well, you can heat up some leftovers. 
 No, no, I can't stay long. 
 I just wanted to drop off these samples for you to try. 
 All the drinks are really good. 
 Mm. 
 The perks of being a distribution salesman. 
 That's right. I have to try the products so I can sell 'em. 
 Yeah, I think you and Dad are really gonna like this green tea fusion. 
 It's packed with antioxidants. 
 Oh. 
 I'm so proud of you. 
 Oh, don't get all mushy on me now. 
 [laughs] 
 Your father, he's always running off doing errands at the wrong time. 
 He misses the good stuff. 
 Uh, maybe you could come back in an hour. 
 You know just kinda drop in on him so he can see you do your stuff. 
 Well, I can't do all that and keep the job. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, how's my car working for you? 
 Oh, it's great, I really appreciate it. 
 The El Camino wouldn't have made it with all the sales stops I have to make. 
 Well, it was just sitting there. 
 I'm glad to see you putting it to good use. 
 Thanks, Mom. 
 Niecy, I bought these for you. 
 Raspberry fusion. 
 No, I'm good, thank you. 
 Come on, just... just try it. 
 I don't even like raspberry. 
 I can't even... 
 What? 
 Excuse me. 
 Niecy. Niecy! 
 Niecy, don't you ever walk away from me. 
 Niecy : I'm busy, I got things to do. 
 Hey! 
 I've had about enough of your disrespect. 
 I don't care how old you get, I'm still your father! 
 Well, you gotta earn respect to get respect. 
 Why can't you see I'm out here trying to get back on my feet to help all of us, huh? 
 I don't need your help. I have a job. 
 Yeah, you got a job, but you're still running my parents ragged with your kids. 
 Not just my kids. 
 What'd you just say? 
 Don't go thinking you're grown after one week of work, little girl. 
 I don't care how mad you get, you need to hear the truth. 
 And the truth is you're rude and ungrateful. 
 And you better check yourself. 
 [phone ringing] 
 Jackie : Hey, baby. 
 Niecy : Oh my God, Mom, please tell me you're here. 
 Jackie : No, baby, I missed my damn flight. 
 But I'm on the next one though. 
 I'm coming. 
 I promised you, I'm coming. 
 Patrick, you're late. 
 [groans] 
 Now, look, you have got to stay on schedule, log inventory properly. 
 You're already an hour behind today, which means... 
 No, I'm getting better. 
 I don't need better. 
 I need excellent. 
 Now I don't care who your father is. 
 If you wanna work at KO Cola, you have to perform. 
 Yeah. 
 Man : Okay. 
 And then she put her hand on her hips, rolled her eyes, and stomped out the room. 
 Mary Jane : No, she didn't. 
 Hand to God. 
 Niecy better stop all that. 
 And then she had the nerve to ask for a ride to work. 
 Niecy : Well, the key takeaway is that she's working. 
 But enough on her. Niecy says that she saw you on the gossip shows, says you're going back to work. 
 It wasn't an interview, Mom. It was just the paparazzi hounding me. 
 Mom : But you're gonna be back on air, right? 
 Yep. 
 Mom : Oh, well, now that's good. 
 Now, you sound ungrateful. 
 [phone beeping] 
 Oh, Mom, look, I gotta let you go, it's work. 
 I guess I'll talk to you... 
 [dial tone sounds] 
 Any updates? 
 Kara : Hey, MJ, uh, Greg's looking for you. 
 I don't wanna talk to his fat ass. 
 Uh, MJ, you're on speakerphone with me and Greg right now, baby doll. 
 And my fat ass wants you in my office now. 
 [dial tone sounds] 
 I am ready for "Primetime." And I'm... happy to announce you won't have to wait much longer. 
 I'll be back on the air on Monday. 
 So you had to go and make a statement? 
 How many times has SNC delayed my return? 
 I had no choice. 
 You walk around here with a chip on your shoulder, unable to see that I am your biggest ally. 
 Me. 
 And despite your general ungrateful disposition, I am the one constantly advocating for you. 
 So I get it. 
 All right, I'm not good at race. 
 I'm white. 
 I'm not going to be good at race. 
 But I am not a racist. 
 And every decision I make around here, Mary Jane, is not about you being black. 
 Now I allowed your complaints of race and discrimination muzzle me. 
 But it didn't stop me from taking notes. 
 Mary Jane Paul, Monday, late. Tuesday, late. 
 Wednesday, didn't do what we ask her. 
 Thursday, sassy. 
 Friday, sassy and late. 
 Oh, and on any given Monday through Friday, never comes in early to prepare. 
 Always strolls in right before air. 
 I'm always prepared. 
 No. 
 What you are is a pain in my ass. 
 [sighs] 
 You're back on Monday. 
 And you better be ready. 
 And if you'd excuse me, my fat ass wants you out of my office. 
 Larry : Hey, what's up, MJ? 
 Mary Jane : Hey, Larry, I need you to come over and work your magic. 
 I'm back on air on Monday, and I need something fly. 
 Larry : Okay. 
 I was thinking about like a... 
 I don't know, I think maybe it's time to go shorter. 
 Anything to help the ratings. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Mom! 
 [yelling] 
 [laughing] 
 Oh my God, I miss you, too. 
 Wow, you got them to sleep fast. 
 Yeah, well, you know, I got it down now. 
 You're really good with them. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, close your eyes. 
 Close my eyes? 
 Yes. 
 Ta-da! 
 Oh my gosh, are you kidding me? 
 [laughs] I couldn't decide, so I got 'em both. 
 Oh, so you just got 'em both. 
 Okay. 
 These are beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you so much, Mom. 
 You're welcome. 
 I wish you were here more, Ma. 
 Child, why? So I can buy you some more stuff? 
 [laughing] 
 No. 
 I just want the kids to, you know, really know you. 
 My work schedule's so crazy right now. I... but I tell you, I'm just a phone call away. 
 And you can always Skype me. 
 Well, when I call you, you know, I can't really reach you. 
 Well you never leave a message. 
 And you never call back. 
 That's not true, I... 
 You know what? 
 I'll just work on it. 
 Okay. 
 You know that little one's still up. 
 Oh, well, I'll go. Let me... 
 Oh, no, no, no, I didn't say it for you to go up there and start spoiling her. 
 I just wanted to give you a general alert. 
 Here, Niecy. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 You're... you're looking good, Mrs. Patterson. 
 Niecy was just catching me on what everybody's doing and her new job. 
 Yeah. 
 And she tells me that you do hair for a stripper. 
 Nicki Minaj, Grandma. 
 She does hair for Nicki Minaj. 
 Who? 
 Niecy : Nicki Minaj. 
 The multimillionaire rapper, singer. 
 Oh, well, whatever pays the bills. 
 We all have bills, you know? 
 Now, Niecy, I hope you're not gonna leave this mess. 
 I don't wanna come in here having to pick up after you. 
 I run a clean house. 
 Good to see you again, Jackie. 
 Uh, thanks. 
 [laughs] What? 
 Unreal. 
 When did she get so nice? 
 Nice? Really? 
 Yes. I mean... 
 She... she spoke to me. 
 That's progress. 
 I can't believe she tried to pretend like she doesn't know who Nicki Minaj is. 
 Everybody knows who she is and that you do her hair. 
 Well, you can do hair, too, you know? 
 Yeah, but you know, hair was always like a side hustle. 
 I don't have a portfolio or anything like that. 
 I've been asking you to get one. 
 Mm-hmm, but can't you just hook me up? 
 You know my skills? 
 Yeah, but the people that I have to sell you to, they don't know that. 
 You have to help me help you, honey. 
 Yeah, well, I already have a job now, so... 
 Yeah, but I'm not talking about a job. 
 I am talking about a viable, lucrative career, okay? 
 Where you can be your own boss. 
 You can... and travel the world. 
 You can have an income that supports you and those beautiful babies. 
 Before you know it, honey, you'll be buying new purses and jewels. 
 [laughs] 
 I won a Ferrari. 
 What? 
 Yeah. [laughs] 
 Who from? 
 In my dreams, honey. 
 I love you, Mom. I'm glad you're here.

 Yeah, I had to get out before the big moment. 
 I'm back on air. 
 That's right, congrats, mama. 
 Yes.

 Okay, so you're telling me that if he wanted to have s*x with you, you would say no? 
 I, uh... 
 I don't know, I'm off from dating. 
 A little so...

 Do you know that football player I told you about? 
 Yeah. 
 He's really been there for me lately. 
 And no. 
 I didn't even get the rest out. 
 You don't have to, I already hear it in your voice. 
 You're trying to make him your man. 
 He is nice to me. 
 And maybe I should stop looking for... the right one and consider a nice one. 
 You know you had it right the first time. 
 Okay, let him be a little scratch for the itch. 
 But, see, don't confuse that... 
 Well, I'm... I'm discovering. 
 Well, maybe you're settling. 
 Look, okay, let's be honest. 
 We both know that if you were trying to make him your man, you would already screw that relationship up. 
 Shut up. 
 You know you would have. 
 Look, Mary Jane... 
 You like him for the s*x, okay? 
 So just spend the rest of the time on you. 
 Read, travel, but please let the one find you.

 Let me ask you a question. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Can you... see a guy that you desire and then have s*x with him that same day? 
 Um... usually I'm more of a three date minimum before the goodies kind of gal. 
 Okay, why? 
 Because it's... 
 Oh my God, Mary Jane, you kill me. 
 Come on, you're always pretending to be this oh miss goody-goody and you're patiently waiting for Mr. Right. 
 Come on, girl, you just know you want a man to blow your back out. 
 Boh! And dinner. 
 Yes. 
 I also want love, but not necessarily in that order. 
 Well, I'll tell you what. Since you're full of it, I see someone I want to go be a naughty boy with. 
 Oh. 
 So that's how you do it, huh? 
 You just walk up and say, Please blow my back out? 
 Mark : Basically, yeah. 
 We don't confuse s*x with relationships. 
 There are several hot-button issues swaying the conversation in this upcoming election from immigration to minimum wage to abortion. 
 But tonight, we'll take an in-depth look at voter suppression. 
 Kara : Keep talking, MJ, the teleprompter broke, but we're working on it. Okay? 
 As we march closer to the election, voter ID laws remain a constant issue of contention. 
 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a critical piece of legislation in this country that was highly effective in eliminating discriminatory practices in elections. 
 In June of 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that section four of the civil rights law was unconstitutional. 
 Section four required certain areas to clear their voting laws with the federal government. 
 See, now that this provision is gone, several states like Wisconsin, Texas, Virginia, and Georgia have begun to pass strict photo ID laws, which have a direct effect on voters, making it much more difficult for people of color, the youth, the disabled, and the elderly to vote. 
 Without restoring this portion of the Voting Rights Act, can we really say that every American has fair and equal access to vote? 
 Kara : All right. 
 You can throw to commercial. 
 After the break, we'll address this question and examine both sides of the argument. 
 Man : And we're out. 
 Jackie : It was so good to spend time with you. 
 Well, thank you for dinner. 
 Oh, baby, you are so welcome. 
 When that boy... Wasn't he cute? 
 [laughs] When he spilled the soup all over his... oh, hey, Patrick. 
 Good to see you, Jackie. 
 Been awhile. 
 Yeah. 
 What happened to you? 
 I thought you were coming back by 9. 
 Niecy : Well, I mean, it wasn't like I was out partying. 
 I was having dinner with mom. 
 Patrick : And I want you to spend time with your mom, but your grandparents can't stay up this late with the kids. 
 And I got an early morning. 
 I tried calling you. 
 Okay, and I tried calling you back. 
 But I had no bars, so like... 
 Niecy, why didn't you tell you needed to be home by 9? 
 I mean, we coulda taken the kids with us. 
 Don't trip. It's... it's not that late, guys. 
 Jackie : I think you're missing the point here. 
 You should never be late. 
 Especially when someone's trying to help you. 
 [sighs] 
 Young lady, you're not a child anymore. 
 And this isn't cute. 
 You understand? 
 [laughs] I'm gonna go to bed. 
 Oh, so you want me to do hair now? 
 Niecy : Nope, not anymore. Thank you. 
 All right. 
 Wow. 
 I'll go talk to her. 
 No, no, no, just... just... just let her feel it. 
 How you been? 
 You know, I've been good. 
 Yeah, you know, we don't really talk much anymore. 
 But, uh, I'll be in town for another day. 
 Maybe we can grab some dinner and catch up. 
 Dinner sounds good. 
 Good. 
 Patrick : Yeah. 
 Good. 
 That one's something else, you know? 
 Patrick : Yeah. I don't know where she gets it from. 
 Tell me again. 
 Flawless, darling. 
 Yes, yes, I was, wasn't I? 
 Yes, you were. 
 I didn't trip, I didn't stumble. 
 No. 
 You can't teach that. 
 No, you cannot. 
 Hmm-mm. 
 You are very cool under pressure. 
 You couldn't see the scar? 
 Kara : No, I couldn't see it. 
 It looks amazing. 
 Okay, okay. 
 You think Greg set me up with the whole teleprompter thing? 
 Seriously? 
 Well, if he did, he failed. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 But you know those things happen. You know it wasn't Greg. 
 Oh goodness. 
 Well, since we worked hard, are you ready to play? 
 Wanna go get some drinks? 
 I wish, I wish, I wish. 
 But you know now that I've moved back in with John and the kids, I have some stuff to do. I gotta unpack. 
 Wanna come over? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Of course not. I knew you were gonna say that.

 All right, well, I'm make it up to you. 
 Uh-huh, sure.

 Kara : Now text me and let me know where you want me to meet you. 
 Okay.

 It's a... this is a cute place. 
 Uh. Heat should be on soon. 
 It takes a minute to warm up, but you know? 
 Uh. 
 Not much, you know? 
 Well, I think it's fine. 
 I just think you need a few little, you know, decorative touches. 
 Like maybe some throw pillows or... a shag rug or, you know, some art on the wall. 
 Yeah, and then you'd be doing something. 
 You gonna take notes. 
 [laughs] 
 Patrick : You still trying t take over, huh? 
 No, you know I like to decorate. 
 Patrick : Mm, you like to spend money. 
 Well, I'm just trying to help you out. 
 I think people should like where they live. 
 Mm. 
 Wait a minute. 
 [laughs] Wait... 
 What? 
 Is this the ticket stub from when we went to see Prince? 
 Patrick : Uh, greatest concert ever. 
 [laughs] I still think about Sheila E, mm. 
 On percussion. 
 Yeah, right, right, right. 
 I almost got smacked that night, too. 
 See, look at that. 
 This is nice. 
 Look at our girls. 
 Yeah, we did that. Yes, we did. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Did you get my email? 
 Already got a promotion her first month at the pharmacy. 
 That's our girl. 
 Yep. 
 When she puts her mind to something... 
 Look, I wanted to say something to you, and I don't want you to take it wrong. 
 Okay. 
 I know that you love her... but you gotta stop letting Niecy walk over you, okay? 
 She doesn't. You just caught her at a bad moment. 
 See, there you go making excuses for her. 
 You and I, we made grownup decisions because we did grownup things. 
 But you keep babying her. 
 You're gonna stunt her growth. 
 Mm. 
 Well, since we're being honest here. 
 Okay. 
 You need to come around more. 
 A lot more. 
 I work. 
 Yeah, so? 
 Well, the reality is, she's... she's mad at both of us. 
 And she takes it out on you. 
 Sorry. 
 Well, she's right though. 
 I don't know about that, but I do know that if she doesn't get out of this pity party, she's gonna end up pregnant again or strung out. 
 You know, um... 
 When things got tough... 
 I should... 
 Did exactly what you did. 
 Snatch the girls up and run off to California? 
 Yeah. 
 Cause look at ya. 
 You doing Nicki Minaj's hair on her world tour. 
 [chuckles] 
 Yeah, I'm on the tour. 
 But I don't do Nicki's hair. 
 I do the dancers' hair. 
 Well, you do Nicki Minaj's dancers' hair. 
 Not just any old dancers' hair. 
 I do love what I do. 
 All the amazing destinations. 
 But, honestly, Pat, I spend most of my time on airplanes and uncomfortable chairs in airports. 
 And not to mention, I'm always on call and... 
 [sighs] 
 I don't even know the last time I slept in my own bed. 
 And I think I messed the girls up. 
 Did I mess 'em up? 
 Brothers are always thinking. 
 Just because... 
 They hit it once, they can hit it again. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sorry for what?
