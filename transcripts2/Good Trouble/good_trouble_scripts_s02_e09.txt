 Previously on "Good Trouble" I just can't imagine us not all sitting around this table together. 
  We are here today to witness the vows that Brandon and Eliza will share with each other. 
  I took the job in L. A. 
  What about our house? 
  Our home? 
  It's a new chapter for us, too. 
  Hey, guys. 
  It's Mariana. 
  We just made it to L. A. 
  The Coterie at the Palace is an intentional community. 
  This is our communal bathroom. 
  - Please, I can explain. 
  - I'm sure you can. 
  You're the best con artist I know. 
  If Jazmin is no longer your child because she's trans, then I guess you have no children at all, because I'm bisexual. 
  I don't have a family like yours. 
  I can't be whatever I want to be. 
  Hey. 
  Hey, whoa. 
  I'm so messed up. 
  They took us away because she was strung out, and unfit to take care of us. 
  I am not sorry! 
  You remember her dragging us to church every Sunday no matter what shape she was in? 
  I had a son. 
  We lost him when he was six. 
  Drove out to this cliff by the beach, I was gonna drive off. 
  Davia, I appreciate everything you are trying to do, but you are suffocating me! 
  - What are you talking about? 
  - You're my sister, Mariana. 
  You're supposed to have my back. 
  "Mariana I decided to move in with Jamie. 
  I'll cover my part of the rent for the rest of the lease. 
  Or until you find a new roommate. 
  I'll get the rest of my stuff this weekend". 
  Um, so my Christmas wish is for Peace on Earth. 
  of course. 
  An end to hate and violence. 
  A system where justice really is for all. 
  That I can make a difference. 
  That Raj calls me. 
  "The secret of happiness is not found in seeking more. 
  But in developing the capacity to enjoy less". 
  Socrates. 
  To unite my family. 
  Find joy. 
  - Fight for what's - Right. 
  - That we stop putting children - In cages. 
  To not be such an asshole. 
  - Try not to lose hope. 
  - Hope. 
  - Hope. 
  - Hope. 
  That I win the lottery. 
  That I'll be a good father. 
  That Lena will understand. 
  That I can forgive my mother. 
  - That we save our country. 
  - Save our planet. 
  Save our planet. 
  Save Venice. 
  That I can save Christmas. 
  So, uh, who's this Christmas festival for? 
  It's for the homeless. 
  And for families that have been impacted by mass incarceration. 
  Did you know that over two million people are incarcerated in this country? 
  Yeah. 
  We imprison more people than any other nation in the world. 
  "You can judge a society by how well it treats its prisoners". 
  Dostoevsky. 
  So the, the Coterie's doing, like, a crafts and Cookie decorating booth, as part of our community service project. 
  And I volunteered to be in charge of it. 
  And I got Speckulate to sponsor us. 
  And they're gonna get us a Santa Claus, and toys, and a bunch of other stuff. 
  Wow, I'm I'm impressed. 
  You sound surprised. 
  You know, contrary to what some people might think, I'm not a manipulative con artist who only thinks of herself. 
  Who said you're a con artist? 
  Raj broke up with Mariana, because he thinks that she went on a date with her boss behind his back. 
  - Did you? 
  - No! 
  Okay, well, I went out with him, but it wasn't a date. 
  And Raj did not break up with me. 
  He just left for India without speaking to me. 
  Well, as Anonymous said, "Be a good person. 
  Don't waste your time proving it". 
  I'm not trying to prove anything. 
  Here. 
  Take a picture of me for my Insta story. 
  There. 
  Has Raj liked any of your posts yet? 
  No. 
  - Jesus is in Nepal? 
  - I thought he was in Tibet. 
  Well, he should be here. 
  It's Christmas. 
  - I have to use the bathroom. 
  - What, no quote for that? 
  Ha, ha, ha. 
  - Ugh, seriously? 
  - People keep bailing on their shifts. 
  I'm gonna need you all day tomorrow. 
  - Do you think Moms'll mind helping? 
  - Oh, I'm sure they won't. 
  If they ever get their asses up here. 
  Okay, you need to chill. 
  They said they'd be here early, and I need time to tell them I quit my clerkship before we have to leave for Jamie's. 
  I don't know why you haven't told them already. 
  - It's not like they can ground you. 
  - You didn't tell them, did you? 
  No. 
  No, I did not tell them. 
  I just, I wanted to explain my reasons for quitting in person. 
  'Cause I don't think I was being impulsive. 
  Okay, well, I'm sure we can be a little late to Jamie's. 
  No. 
  We cannot. 
  So my mom wants to start the party at 4:00, so she and my dad can make their early Christmas Eve service in Newport. 
  Mm. 
  Can't wait. 
  - It'll be fine. 
  - Mm. 
  As long as we don't talk politics or religion. 
  Please don't tell my moms you're a Republican. 
  - Okay. 
  Please don't be late. 
  - I'm never late. 
  Your family tends to be a little more flexible about arrival times. 
  And since this is the first time my parents are meeting you - They've met me. 
  - As my girlfriend. 
  I just don't wanna start the night off on the wrong foot. 
  Okay. 
  We will not be late. 
  This is why I wanted to use Waze. 
  I know, I know. 
  Takes you on all these crazy detours, and makes you make left turns onto busy streets with no light. 
  - We passed it. 
  - To avoid traffic. 
  So you're not sitting on the freeway not moving for five hours. 
  Fine. 
  I'll just tell everyone it's my fault. 
  It's not your fault. 
  Oof. 
  - Excuse me - Oh, stoner moms. 
  Right on. 
  Merry Christmas. 
  Merry Christmas. 
  Okay. 
  We are here. 
  Let's just relax and enjoy the holidays. 
  You're late. 
  We have to leave for Jamie's in 10 minutes. 
  Just dump your stuff, and, uh, you're just gonna have to wear what you have on. 
  Well, Merry Christmas to you, too. 
  Can I at least use the restroom? 
  - Really? 
  - Okay, but hurry. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi! 
  - Is that a, a, a nose ring? 
  - Yeah, you like it? 
  I think Diane's gonna hate it. 
  Okay, how do you think Diane's gonna feel about your mom showing up to her party in jeans? 
  Okay, you can change. 
  But you have 9 minutes and 9 seconds. 
  Have you told anybody about what's going on? 
  No. 
  I don't want to ruin Christmas for everyone. 
  I'll tell 'em after New Year's. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey, Joey. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  Do you have any cotton balls? 
  Yes. 
  I do. 
  Aah. 
  Eureka! 
  Cotton balls. 
  Thank you. 
  Ooh. 
  I love you so much. 
  I love you, too. 
  What's going on? 
  Nothing, nothing, you know. 
  I just 'Tis the season. 
  Merry Christmas. 
  Merry Christmas. 
  No rush. 
  Take your time with those cotton balls. 
  Can you all walk faster? 
  - We're only - Twenty minutes late. 
  So sorry we're late. 
  Oh, are you late? 
  We hadn't noticed. 
  There was so much traffic coming up from San Diego. 
  - Hi. 
  - Oh, you know what? 
  You should use Waze. 
  I've heard that. 
  We haven't seen you all since the wedding. 
  And what a lovely wedding it was. 
  - Mm. 
  - Uh, this is for you. 
  - Oh. 
  How sweet. 
  Thank you. 
  - Wow. 
  Um, could you put this in one of the bedrooms? 
  Wow, look at this view. 
  I usually host a big Christmas Eve party at our home in Newport, but now that all of your kids are involved with ours, except Carter Hands off. 
  So, before another moment passes, I believe congratulations are in order to state assembly woman-elect Lena Adams Foster. 
  Hear, hear. 
  Cheers. 
  Thank you so much. 
  So what is first up on the agenda? 
  Uh, free college and health care? 
  Open borders? 
  Um, abolish ICE? 
  Can I make a cocktail for anyone? 
  I love a martini. 
  Martinis, coming up. 
  Yeah, uh, seriously, though, are you, are you a fan of this AOC, and her squad? 
  Let's not talk politics, Jim. 
  Well, I mean, - it was just a little bit of - Brandon and I have big news. 
  I've been offered first chair. 
  With the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. 
  - Oh, my gosh. 
  - What? 
  That's one the best orchestras in the world. 
  Some say it is the best. 
  Congratulations, sweetheart. 
  Oh, you have worked so hard for this. 
  So, so, so when do you kids leave? 
  Uh, well, actually, I'm, I'm not going with her. 
  Let not your heart be troubled Ye believe in God Hi. 
  Damn. 
  You giving Jesus all of that? 
  Hello. 
  Hi. 
  So, are we going to church, or Yes. 
  We're going to church. 
  I just got wrapped up in my mom's Bible. 
  I'm gonna bring this for Dom. 
  Oh. 
  Yeah. 
  But How you feeling about your mom? 
  It's your first Christmas without her. 
  I feel fine. 
  It's gonna be harder for Dom. 
  He's still grieving. 
  Uh, and you're not? 
  I grieved my mom long before she died. 
  Dom should have this. 
  He's the one who still goes to our old church, so Well, why you stop going? 
  I mean, I'm a believer, but I don't need to go to church to worship God. 
  And I don't need to be judged by a bunch of church ladies. 
  Or condemned by some old pastor screaming about our unworthy asses. 
  Yeah, I feel you. 
  - But ain't nothing unworthy about your ass. 
  - Oh. 
  I appreciate that. 
  - Uh - Still got a little time. 
  All this church talk turning you on? 
  Yeah. 
  We'll repent later. 
  The oven isn't working. 
  Did you try turning the dial to 350? 
  Yes, Dennis. 
  Where are you going? 
  Away for a few days, while the holiday fervor dies down. 
  No. 
  You can't. 
  If I don't show up with 200 sugar cookies to decorate for our festival booth tomorrow, Mariana is going to murder me. 
  Hmm. 
  Not to mention the disappointed children. 
  I'm a teacher. 
  I deal with disappointed children all day. 
  The wrath of Mariana, however, is It's terrifying. 
  Does he look happy to you? 
  Happiness is not a state of being. 
  It's a state of mind. 
  Hey, how's that ethics class going, Jude? 
  Oh, great. 
  So, Jude, are you seeing anyone? 
  Nope. 
  Hey, is that all you're eating? 
  I've been nauseous all day. 
  I feel you. 
  You must miss Jesus. 
  Is this the first Christmas he's spent away from home? 
  - Yes, and we're not very happy about it. 
  - Hmm. 
  I understand the need to travel and find one's self. 
  So, is Have you always had that nose earring? 
  Mm. 
  No, it's new. 
  Mm. 
  It's It's lovely. 
  I think we should take a sip of champagne every time one of our parents says something's lovely. 
  Uh, hey, where's your restroom? 
  Uh, down the hall. 
  First door on your left. 
  Thanks. 
  How you doing? 
  Well, I would be doing better if I'd been able to tell my moms about my clerkship, but somebody had me in a panic about running late. 
  Well, it's a good thing. 
  If you hadn't been in a panic, who knows what time you would have gotten here. 
  - Huh. 
  - Huh. 
  We're I, I'm in here. 
  Oh, all right. 
  Sorry. 
  Knock, knock. 
  I made it. 
  Hey. 
  I think you're supposed to come down the chimney, not from behind the oven. 
  Well, it wasn't working. 
  But luckily for us, - I fixed it, so Feliz Nochebuena. 
  - Feliz Nochebuena. 
  I'm so happy to be here. 
  I'm so glad you're here. 
  So I got the tamales and soy milk for the coquitos in case anyone's dairy free. 
  - Well, I brought the lechon and ceviche. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  So now all we gotta do is make the flan. 
  I thought we'd do buÃ±uelos this year. 
  What do you mean? 
  We have to have flan. 
  It's our tradition. 
  We don't have to follow every family tradition. 
  Look. 
  I know how difficult it is being estranged from your family. 
  Especially around the holidays. 
  My first Nochebuena alone, I cried all night. 
  But you, you're not alone. 
  Okay? 
  You have me. 
  And we can do our own Nochebuena. 
  Especially when we're not welcome at theirs. 
  Jazmin. 
  - Hey. 
  - Happy Nochebuena. 
  - Hi. 
  - Happy Nochebuena. 
  - Thank you so much for inviting us. 
  - Hey, of course. 
  - Thanks for coming. 
  - Of course. 
  - Uh, what can we do to help? 
  - Um, maybe set the table. 
  - Sure. 
  - Yeah. 
  The table. 
  So many great meals we shared at this table. 
  All the memories we made. 
  All the food we shared. 
  Thank you. 
  You're welcome. 
  We'll make some more great memories tonight. 
  Gael, go change before everyone gets here. 
  - And we're gonna make coquitos. 
  - Coquitos! 
  - Coquitos. 
  - Ooh, what's in coquitos? 
  - Okay, so we're gonna need some coconut. 
  Yep. 
  - Okay. 
  - Cinnamon, and some clove. 
  - Mm. 
  Are you sure this is okay? 
  Until escrow closes, the house is still mine. 
  And so is the oven. 
  I mean, is this okay for you, being here? 
  With everything gone, it's just an empty house. 
  - Oh. 
  Yeah. 
  No worries. 
  - Sorry. 
  Mami called. 
  So you're talking to them. 
  They're talking to me. 
  Mom wanted me to come for Nochebuena. 
  Of course. 
  You can do no wrong. 
  I still haven't heard from Dad since I told them I was bi. 
  Yeah, but they don't care. 
  They still wanna see you. 
  I'm not going, Jaz. 
  I'm here with you. 
  Yeah, but you wanna be with the family, so just go. 
  - I'm not leaving you alone on Nochebuena. 
  - Why not? 
  You left me alone for the past three years. 
  And the only reason you planned to be with me tonight is 'cause you thought you weren't welcome at home. 
  Yeah, you're right. 
  I never should have let you spend even one Nochebuena alone. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Call her. 
  No. 
  Abuelo is in the hospital. 
  What? 
  Okay, I'll see you soon. 
  They think he had a stroke, and doctors think it might be serious. 
  - We need to go now. 
  - We? 
  They called you, not me. 
  Jazmin. 
  I'm not welcome in this family. 
  Abuelo would want you there. 
  He knows why I can't be. 
  Jazmin, do you think it was easy for him to come to your quince? 
  To stand up to Mom and Dad? 
  But he did it anyway. 
  You may never be invited, Jazmin. 
  But it doesn't mean you can't show up. 
  So, I could have worn pants. 
  I told you, this is the new church. 
  They aren't new. 
  Those are the church ladies I was telling you about. 
  Oh. 
  Probably wondering what the hell I'm doing here. 
  I'm sure they are happy to see you. 
  They've been very supportive since Mom died. 
  Oh, um I want you to have this. 
  - Sis, no - You want it. 
  See, you all lit up. 
  You should have it. 
  - For real? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Don't make me change my mind. 
  - Okay. 
  All right. 
  Joy to the world The Lord is come Let Earth receive her King Let every heart Prepare, prepare Him room And heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing And heaven, and heaven and nature sing Joy to the world Joy to the world Joy to the world He brought joy to the world What are you doing in here? 
  Oh, thank God it's you. 
  Isn't this amazing? 
  I would die for a closet like this. 
  Yeah, you could never have a closet like this. 
  You're a total slob. 
  Uh, just because I don't have a place to put everything. 
  I bet you his sock drawer is perfectly organized. 
  - Okay. 
  Mariana. 
  - What? 
  That's his underwear drawer. 
  And perfectly folded. 
  As suspected. 
  Briefs. 
  Hmm. 
  Surprising, but classic. 
  Can you stop snooping? 
  I'm not snooping. 
  I'm admiring. 
  Okay, well, I'm outta here. 
  Peace. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Every kiss under the mistletoe Ugh. 
  Those look so good. 
  - Right? 
  - You've definitely done this before. 
  How do you get yours so perfect? 
  You gotta wiggle the cookie cutter just a little bit, like that. 
  Dee dee dee dee dee It's a lot easier. 
  Well, do you have to go dee dee dee dee dee for it to work? 
  - It's a requisite. 
  Of course. 
  - Mm. 
  Okay. 
  Don't be shy. 
  So is this beautiful kitchen where you honed your craft? 
  I never had time to cook back then. 
  I was too busy working. 
  Barely ever made it home for dinner. 
  What was Christmas like? 
  It was big. 
  Huge tree. 
  - Tons of presents. 
  - Hmm. 
  Christmas was always a happy time in this house. 
  All right, if you put some flour down, then the dough does not stick to the - Oh. 
  Excuse me. 
  - Counter. 
  Excuse you. 
  Counting down every minute Really? 
  Till the clock strikes five You wanna do this? 
  Oh! 
  Aah! 
  Okay, just, just, just You win. 
  You win. 
  You win. 
  But if we were back in Fitchburg Okay! 
  I would totally crush you in a snowball fight. 
  Really. 
  Says the woman covered head to toe in flour. 
  Says the man who has never even seen snow. 
  All right. 
  Where's your bathroom? 
  Around the corner to the right. 
  - Okay! 
  - Sorry. 
  There's no toilet paper! 
  Oh, try upstairs. 
  Found some. 
  - Sorry. 
  - It's okay. 
  Come play with us! 
  Mijo. 
  I'm glad you came. 
  I didn't come alone. 
  I'll leave if I'm not welcome. 
  Of course you're welcome. 
  I want Abuelo to know that I was here. 
  Si. 
  It's Jazmin. 
  I'm here, Abuelo. 
  Our story with Christ is a love story. 
  And it began all the way back in Bethlehem, when Jesus Christ was born. 
  When our great pursuer through his great blood, that we have life. 
  more abundant. 
  But as I look around, it becomes apparent that that blood no longer flows through every member. 
  It shows in your worship! 
  Why'd she even come? 
  Why'd she even come like that? 
  Those poor kids. 
  That's what the drugs'll do to you. 
  She need to ask the Lord to help her or somebody gonna take those kids away from her. 
  What can make it whole again? 
  Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
  Hallelujah. 
  That blood is our lifeline to intimacy with Christ. 
  He loved us so much that He shed His own blood to be in right relationship with us. 
  See, that's what Christmas is all about, y'all. 
  See, it's the ultimate gift of Christ himself. 
  And his love, that lives inside of each and every one of us. 
  If we just say yes. 
  - Can I get a amen? 
  - Amen. 
  - Can I get a praise God? 
  - Praise God! 
  - Can I get a amen? 
  - Amen. 
  Y'all better come on up in here and preach with me. 
  - Can I get a praise God? 
  - Praise God. 
  There it is. 
  There it is. 
  Praise him. 
  Maybe next year, we'll all meet in Amsterdam for the holidays. 
  - Wow. 
  Hmm. 
  - That would be lovely. 
  So lovely. 
  So, a year. 
  That's a long time for a newlywed couple to be apart. 
  Yes. 
  Uh, but, you know, I plan to - visit, as much as work will allow. 
  - Hmm. 
 
 
 
  And, uh, this new job of yours, are you composing music? 
  Uh, no. 
  I am, I am just the assistant to the composer. 
  But, uh You know, I mean, it's I think it's It's a foot in the door. 
  I mean, that's why it's so hard to get these assistant jobs. 
  It's very competitive. 
  Okay. 
  Uh, what films has this composer worked on? 
  Yes, anything we might have seen? 
  - Uh, he does mostly TV. 
  - Oh. 
  What shows? 
  Uh, have you seen, um, "The Bachelor"? 
  You know, I'm obsessed with "The Bachelor". 
  And the music is excellent. 
  It's very filmic. 
  Well, we're very proud of you. 
  Oh, of, of course. 
  We all are. 
  Really? 
  - Well, we'll have to, um, check it out. 
  - Yes. 
  Yes. 
  And speaking of long-distance relationships, Lena, uh, how much time will you be spending in Sacramento? 
  Quite a bit, when we're in session. 
  It's gonna be a huge learning curve. 
  - And a whole new life. 
  - Hmm. 
  But Stef is gonna take some time off from work, and, uh, come with me as I go back and forth. 
  Well, that's nice, Stef. 
  To sacrifice to support your wife. 
  You don't have to sacrifice your career to do that. 
  All I'm saying is that Lena is starting an exciting new chapter in her life, and it's nice that Stef wants to be there for her. 
  A new chapter for both of us. 
  But if Stef didn't want to come to Sacramento with me, I would certainly understand. 
  Of course. 
  Shall we have dessert? 
  - That would be lovely. 
  - Hmm. 
  That must have taken some time. 
  Just three consecutive weekends. 
  See? 
  You weren't always working. 
  Jacob loved the Big Dipper. 
  I used to tell him it was full of ice cream and candy. 
  Mm. 
  Sometimes I think I don't want it to get any easier because I'm afraid I'll forget his face. 
  The more time passes, the further away he gets. 
  Do you ever dream about him? 
  No. 
  So - Mm. 
  - I'm gonna move out of the Coterie. 
  Why? 
  I'm gonna get some money from the sale of the house and I figured I'd do a little traveling. 
  Dennis, you've barely left your loft in the past two months. 
  Are you sure you're not just gonna get an apartment, and hole up, and avoid everyone? 
  Ah. 
  I wouldn't mind a little bit of privacy. 
  Isolation isn't safe for you right now. 
  You're depressed, and grieving. 
  And I'm scared you're just gonna disappear. 
  Please. 
  I'll be okay. 
  All right? 
  Who's that? 
  I think we get some Barcaloungers in here with cup holders and a 70-inch TV on the wall. 
  - Over my dead body. 
  - Who are they? 
  - The new owners. 
  - I thought you said escrow hasn't closed yet. 
  Well, I could be wrong about that. 
  Maybe we should just explain why we're here. 
  Still smells like fresh-baked cookies in here. 
  Does that really get people to buy houses? 
  Worked on us. 
  Let's go see the bedrooms. 
  Ugh. 
  They left all these decals up. 
  Well, guess we need to repaint, anyway. 
  I like robots. 
  And what if we have a boy? 
  Do you feel like, uh Do you feel like making a baby? 
  - We do need to christen the house. 
  - Yeah. 
  Are you all right? 
  Uh Yeah, I'm just sick to my stomach. 
  Do you think you have, like, the flu or something? 
  No. 
  I think I'm pregnant. 
  Guess who I ran into at Fashion Island the other day? 
  - Hmm? 
  - Heather. 
  - Oh. 
  - Yeah, Heather is Jamie's ex-girlfriend. 
  - They were together five years? 
  - Not exactly. 
  Well, no, you met in undergrad at SC.

  What kind of complications? 
  Well, there can be paralysis, or loss of movement, speech. 
  Again, we won't know until he wakes up.

  Well, maybe you'll surprise yourself and say yes.
