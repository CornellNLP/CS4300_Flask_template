 This is Mariana Adams Foster.   
 - For real? You're an engineer? 
- Yes.   
 We'll get you started on some data entry.   
 MARIANA:  I was hired to develop software.   
 I'm team leader. I assign the work and the time that it takes.   
 I've been trying not to say "I'm sorry" as a feminist.   
 - Is it someone's birthday? 
- My best friend, Sumi.   
 - MARIANA:  I thought that was your girlfriend. 
- We're engaged!    
 I want you to be my maid-of-honor.    
 I just happen to be still in love with her.    
 This is Rebecca, this is Ben. Fellow clerks.    
 CALLIE:  You're angry that the judge gave me   
  the Jamal Thompson case.   
 I don't allow empathy to distort my judgment,    
 and I have no use for clerks who do.    
 You told your friends I'm clerking the Jamal case?    
 MALIKA:  Was I not supposed to?   
 CALLIE:  No one's supposed to know what cases I'm working on.   
 I could get fired!

 So, on a scale of one to ten,    
 how deep is the sh1t we're in?    
 A shit-ten. Get it? Like shit-ton?    
 You sure you can handle another?    
 I can drink any Harvard grad under the table.    
 (BEN SCOFFS) We'll see about that.    
 We knew how to party at Yale.    
 Harvardians are notoriously boring.    
 You'll always be ranked number two to our number one.    
 Have you ever seen the judge that angry before?    
 - No. 
- Nope.    
 Could you imagine being his kid?    
 Probably a reason they're both studying abroad.    
 His son's not.    
 How do you know?    
 The judge said he's doing a semester at sea.    
 Well, he's not. I met him.    
 - What? 
- When?    
 ♪    
 That was... awkward.    
 You think?    
 - You didn't have to rub it in. 
- Me?    
 Wait a minute. I forgot my phone.    
 You need to get a grip on that thing.    
 You don't want to miss another important call.    
 We'll wait for you out here.    
 Maybe down the street.    
 Yeah! Yeah, that's true...

 What about Justice John Marshall Harlan?    
 The "Great Dissenter?"    
 You realize he argued against segregation for blacks,    
 but agreed that Chinese were so different from whites    
 that they couldn't become U.S. citizens.    
 So, not so great.    
 Guess they didn't teach you that at Yale.    
 What about a case like  Gideon v. Wainwright  ?    
 Too easy.    
 Harlan's not easy?    
 BEN: How about Lieutenant Watada?    
 He refused to deploy to Iraq in     ,    
 'cause he thought the war was illegal.    
 Interesting how someone with no political convictions,    
 chooses Watada, who stood up for his.    
 BEN: My political conviction is to get Wilson    
 to feed me to an appellate judge and then the Supreme Court.    
 So you can change the world?    
 (SCOFFS) So I can write my ticket    
 to any law firm in the country and get rich.    
 - Of course. 
- Some of us weren't born with a trust fund.    
 How do you know I have a trust fund?    
 You don't?    
 What about Jamal Thompson?    
 You don't have to keep reminding us    
 you got the case we all wanted.    
 I wasn't. Sometimes the last thing you think of     
 is the thing that's right in front of you.     
 All right, I will see you all tomorrow at my house.     
 I'm gonna barbecue.     
 Oh, and, uh, just so you know,     
 I've never been stumped, but don't let that stop you from trying.     
 Remember, case or legal figure.     
 We're at holiday, and we have to spend it     
 at his house playing twenty questions.     
 BEN: Speaking of questions, I have one for Callie.     
 Remember that girl who entered the courtroom late?     
 The one Jamal's mother waved over to sit next to her?     
  Do you know her?   
 ♪     
 Why would you think I know her?     
 It's just the way you were looking at her.     
 I saw her...     
 on the courthouse steps...     
  protesting.   
 So, yeah, I recognized her.     
 But you don't know her.     
 Asked and answered.     
 All right.     
 ♪     
 DAVIA: All of my friends from home are married,     
 and a few are even the good kind of pregnant.     
 On purpose.     
 I just don't know what I'm doing here.     
 I never even wanted to be a teacher.     
 Then why are you?     
 Because Teach for America helps pay your student loans,     
 and I thought it would give me time to figure out     
 what the hell I want to do. I still have no clue.     
 Maybe I should have stayed in Fitchburg,     
 maybe I'd be married and have a house and a yard.     
 Oh, so Jeff's in town.     
 - Who's Jeff? 
- A friend from high school.     
 - BRYAN: A friend with benefits. 
- Okay.     
 And she only talks about moving home     
 when he's visiting, so...     
 Yes, he's in town.     
 In fact, I have to run. We're getting drinks.     
 Well, have him join us. I want to meet this guy.     
 Yeah, me too.     
 He's very... corn-fed.     
 I love corn!     
 Don't worry. We'll be nice.     
 Okay...     
 Oh, I ordered us Veuve, on me.     
 Okay, Champagne  Mami  , I see you!     
 - BOTTLE SERVICE: Thank you. 
- While I may hate working at Speckulate,     
 I do love those fat paychecks.     
 - Cheers. 
- Cheers!     
 Uh, Mariana, could you respond to the group chat     
 about the Digital Planet account?     
 Oh, yeah, sorry. Doing that now.     
 (LAUGHTER)     
 - Jeez! 
- Very funny, Alex!     
 Wow, Mariana, I don't think I have to tell you     
 this is very inappropriate workplace behavior.     
 You know, I could take this to H.R.     
 Oh, so could I. This could be considered sexual harassment.     
 Raj, do you feel harassed?     
 (LAUGHS) Yeah, a little.     
 I'm just curious: why my boy, Raj?     
 (INDIAN ACCENT) Hmm?     
 Because he's the most eligible bachelor     
 - from Pakistan? 
- Dude, I'm Indian.     
 (INDIAN ACCENT) Would you like to charm his snake?     
 - (ALEX LAUGHS) 
- You think you're being funny?     
 Talk about harassment.     
 Come on, Raj knows I'm kidding, right, Raj?     
 It's fine.     
 (INDIAN ACCENT) This snake can't be tamed!     
 (LAUGHING) There it is.     
 See, not everybody's so sensitive.     
 If you wanna be part of the team,     
 you gotta learn to take a joke, Mariana.     
 So we can add racist on top of sexist     
 and overall douchiness.     
 - Ugh. 
- At least you're making bank, girl.     
 I'm hardly getting by.     
 So where's your sister tonight?     
 Don't you mean, where's Gael tonight?     
 No, and I know where he is.     
 - Mmm. 
- He went to see his parents.     
 Okay, well, don't put her in the middle.     
 Don't worry. I'm Sweden.     
 Yeah, I think you mean Switzerland.     
 Well, she's working as always.     
 Not always...     
 JEFF: Hey there, beautiful.     
 DAVIA: Hi!     
 MEERA:  So my brother's gonna be my "best man,"   
 and then we're gonna share bridesmaids.     
 I want a big traditional wedding.     
 Anything Baby wants...     
 Aww...     
 Oh, Alice, what are those flowers you always get me?     
 - he ones I love so much? 
- Peonies.     
 I want those. Oh, and there's this wedding planning site     
 called ITheeWed. biz, which is supposed to be really helpful.     
 Okay, yeah, I'll check it out.     
 There's a registration fee.     
 I'll Venmo you.     
 Don't worry. I got it.     
 So we are trying to figure out where to get married.     
 - What do you think? 
- How about you get married     
 up your stupid little ass, you bitch?     
 - What do you think? 
- Maybe a beach wedding might be nice.     
 Or we could get married here on the roof.     
 I mean, it's beautiful at sunset.     
 And we could have, like, gardenias floating in the pool.     
 - Hey, babe, we gotta go. 
- Oh, great, okay.     
 - Love you! 
- Love you, too.     
 - Don't even say it. 
- Why are you doing this?     
 It's like exposure therapy, okay?     
 If I help her plan this wedding,     
 then I'll be numb to the fact that she's not marrying me.     
 And if she's a total bridezilla,     
 maybe I'll even end up hating her.     
 Hey, Alice, the WI-FI's still real spotty in my loft.     
 I just had this guy install this extender last week.     
 Yeah, well, the signal still sucks.     
 So, look, I think it's only fair     
 that I don't pay my part of the internet bill anymore.     
 Okay.     
 Yeah, that, um, sounds reasonable, I guess.     
 Perf.     
 Oh, um, we're out of toilet paper, too.     
 I'll take care of it.     
 Okay, so I drew a pen1s and balls     
 with sharpie on the white board.     
 And then with a dry-erase pen,     
 I drew a tail and floppy ears,     
 eyes, whiskers so it looked like a dog.     
 And when Mrs. Hillebrand went to wipe it off...     
 Only the pen1s was left.     
 The look on her face was priceless.     
 You can't complain about being a teacher ever again.     
 - (PHONE BUZZING) 
- Yeah, karma's a bitch.     
 - Oh, that's weird. 
- What?     
 My house alarm just went off.     
 Probably nothing, it's probably just the dog.     
 I'll be right back.     
 - Okay. 
- Okay.     
 So, he's fantastic.     
 And so into you.     
 Are you sure this is just friends with benefits?     
 Ohhh, maybe more.     
 Okay, well, I have to pee.     
 - Order another round on me. 
- Absolutely!     
 Yeah, if it was the motion sensor in the living room,     
 it was probably the dog.     
 No, I'm actually out of town right now.     
 Did you try my wife?     
 Okay, you should have her cell phone on record.     
 Okay, thanks.

 Wait, uh, interviews for what?     
 Just how great the culture is.     
 You know, that kind of thing.     
 MARIANA:  The culture sucks!   
 So does this so-called "diversity."     
 Most of our engineering staff are white guys,     
 but who do they cherry-pick to put on the jobs page?     
 The handful of women and people of color.     
 So what else is new?     
 Every company, every school tries to advertise as "diverse."     
 Doesn't it bother you?

 eighty percent of tech execs are white

 So how do you feel about the NFL fining players     
 who kneel during the anthem?     
 I think a private employer has the right     
 to set standards of conduct and enact reprisals if need be.     
 I don't find it appropriate that they disrespect the anthem     
 when there are other methods to getting their point across.     
 I think the NFL is right in punishing them.     
 Sounds like the senator from Texas speaking.     
 Do you ever break ranks with your grandfather?     
 Not if I want to stay in the will.     
 (JUDGE WILSON LAUGHS)     
 Fair enough... Callie?     
 I think it's a clear violation of the First Amendment.     
 I'm so tired of liberals misinterpreting the First Amendment.     
 As opposed to conservatives using it to allow corporations     
 to buy off political candidates     
 and discriminate against gay people?     
 Technically, freedom of speech only protects citizens     
 from government censorship.     
 When the President of the United States is pressuring     
 a private employer to adopt a punitive workplace rule,     
 that is government censorship.     
 Not to mention the NFL changed their terms of employment     
 without consulting the players' union,     
 which is a violation of good-faith bargaining,     
 and against the law.     
 - That's a stretch. 
- Yeah, agreed.     
 - I disagree.

 I don't like the kneeling during our national anthem,
