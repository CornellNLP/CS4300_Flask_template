 Previously on Good Trouble  
 She is guilting you into taking care of her! 
  - Dom? 
  - Don't go in. 
  You need to brand yourself. 
  Use social media to promote your art, and that beautiful face. 
  - I'm kind of behind on rent. 
  - How much do you need? 
  JAZMIN: 1,800 dollars. 
  I'm over Sumi. 
  I hope that you can see that. 
  - She's not over you. 
  - I want to build tiny houses. 
  Jesus, I like your idea. 
  Let me think on it a beat and I'll get back to you. 
  I ran into Jennifer a couple of months back. 
  We've been seeing each other. 
  She says the divorce is almost final. 
  Half our assets are legally yours. 
  How could you not tell me Jeff was in town? 
  What did you say to make him go away? 
  JUDGE WILSON: I've reached my decision. 
  Officer Griffin's personnel records will remain sealed. 
  It's the Jamal Thompson police shooting case. 
  They're alleging that he never received prompt medical care after he was shot. 
  Yeah, they let him lie there bleeding for 15 minutes before they let the EMTs in. 
  You're off the Jamal Thompson case. 
  Kate will be replacing you. 
  Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm I have some good news. 
  I found you a lawyer. 
  And she spoke to the catering company, and they're willing to give you $10,000 to settle. 
  You can have the money in your account by the end of the week. 
  Or you can take it to trial. 
  - And? 
  - That could be a long, drawn-out ordeal. 
  You might end up with nothing, in the end. 
  It's not about the money for me. 
  I want employers to stop discriminating against trans people. 
  We need the publicity of a trial. 
  What do you think? 
  I think you need to follow your heart. 
  Head full of ghosts Can't close your eyes One of these days I'll let 'em die Congratulations. 
  You won. 
  I hear you crying to sleep at night Mmm-mmm Pa-pa-pa pa-pa-pa, pa, pa Pa-pa-pa pa-pa-pa, pa, pa And then we'll find our peace of mind You and me, bel ami Pa-pa-pa, pa, pa Hey Na nana na, nana na, Hey Na nana na, nana na, Hey Na nana na, na  
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  You're welcome for the adoring fans. 
  I told you gay Instagram would come through. 
  Honestly, I feel like I deserve a 10 percent commission for any sales tonight. 
  Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
  Your art is amazing. 
  Don't worry. 
  It'll sell. 
  Might have had a bidding war, if you took some photos with your shirt off. 
  But for the fun police, let's get some G-rated shots next to your work. 
  - Come on. 
  - All right. 
  Oh, babe. 
  Hide your hands. 
  They're stained. 
  God forbid we see evidence he actually made the art. 
  So good, so good, yeah, you're looking so good Hey. 
  Thanks for coming up. 
  I, um I need to ask you something. 
  - (PHONE CAMERA CLICKS) 
  - Got it. 
  Summer sun Hey. 
  Wash away your troubles  
  - Hi. 
  - How was it today? 
  - It was fine. 
  - Hmm. 
  Hmm. 
  Kate feels awful that I got her the job and she got my case. 
  And Ben's just pissed Wilson didn't give it to him. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - It's okay. 
  Did you talk to your investigator? 
  I did. 
  - Anything good? 
  - I will tell you on the way to the bar. 
  He confirmed that the felony assault charges against Judge Wilson's son were dropped, and all he got was probation for the misdemeanor DUI, but there's nothing unusual about that. 
  Nothing unusual about the police dropping charges when someone tried to assault a police officer. 
  No, not that he's hearing. 
  But there is apparently something else he came across that he didn't want to talk about over the phone. 
  Okay, we are not just here for the free booze. 
  Girl, speak for yourself. 
  For real. 
  I do not want to find a stack of these on the bar at the end of the night. 
  Sis, I got you. 
  When was the last time you got some sleep? 
  Who's got time for sleep? 
  (UPBEAT R&B MUSIC PLAYING) 
  Ah, we got the permit for the protest! 
  - We are good to go day one of the trial! 
  - Yes, yes! 
  Okay, well, I'm gonna put the invite out on Facebook. 
  I got Twitter and Instagram. 
  Okay, well, we need to hit the streets. 
  You know, pass out fliers. 
  We can't just rely on our social media circles. 
  - Malika, did we get Patrisse Cullors? 
  - Still trying. 
  Who's Patrisse Cullors? 
  She's one of the three women who co-founded Black Lives Matter. 
  - Cool. 
  - Yeah. 
  I had no idea how much goes into planning a legit protest. 
  Hey, Malika. 
  Where's Isaac? 
  I don't know. 
  Should I? 
  Girl, what is wrong with you? 
  Nothing, I just don't have time for dating right now, you know? 
  Maybe after the protest and the trial and my finals. 
  - And graduation. 
  We gotta have a party. 
  - Ooh, hell, yes. 
  It's no big deal. 
  Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh There is a time that Girl, you need to rest, or you gon' go postal. 
  That is the time when I let you go - What? 
  - Nothing. 
  I thought I saw Dom. 
  You heard from him? 
  MALIKA: No, he has made it perfectly clear that he wants nothing to do with me, and I'm done reaching out to him, so Where you going? 
  We ain't gon' see Marie Antoinette? 
  Hey. 
  Fancy seeing you here. 
  I literally texted you the address. 
  We just stopped by for a drink, and then, uh, we're headed to dinner. 
  So, the big day is in a week, huh? 
  - (BOTH): Yeah. 
  - You must be excited. 
  We are really excited to get married. 
  So. 
  How are things with Joey? 
  Great. 
  Yeah. 
  It's always great in the beginning, right? 
  - I guess. 
  I mean, it - The chemistry. 
  The s*x. 
  The mystery. 
  When that's gone, what's left? 
  - Ice cream and "Dateline"? 
  - (SUMI LAUGHS) 
  See, like, does she make you laugh? 
  Are you best friends? 
  Or have you made a big mistake because someone else was your soul mate this whole time, and you were just too clueless to see it. 
  They'll be talking 'bout you long after you die Long after you die  
  (BOTH CHUCKLING) 
  (UPBEAT POP SONG PLAYING) 
  Thank you so much for coming. 
  I'm a complete idiot when it comes to art. 
  There were only so many non-engineering electives that I could take at MIT. 
  Oh, at my college we didn't even have electives. 
  They just shoved the engineers into one history of humanities class called "Great Ideas. 
  " Are you serious? 
  What constitutes a great idea? 
  Well, fire, obviously. 
  The wheel. 
  Postmates. 
  Um (CHUCKLES) 
  - Oh, God. 
  - What? 
  Angela's here. 
  Did you read Angela's email yet? 
  No. 
  What did it say? 
  That she's heard about a rumored spreadsheet. 
  She knows about the spreadsheet. 
  Uh, rumored spreadsheet. 
  She'd need a password to access it, and if she did have it, I would be fired. 
  - How so? 
  - Well, there's only two Latina engineers, and since I'm the only one of us that input that in the race column, she would have looked into our salaries and figured out it was me. 
  The whole thing is pointless, anyway, if we don't have the men's salaries. 
  We're computer geniuses. 
  Why don't we hack into HR and get them? 
  Because we don't want to be felons? 
  A few threatened to take their names off the list, but I managed to talk them off the ledge by telling them that if we went down, I would take the fall. 
  By the way, I completely get it if you want to take your ethnicity off of it. 
  If you go down, I'm going down with you. 
  - So. 
  Jeff's back. 
  - Yeah. 
  I, uh actually have you to thank for that. 
  I think when you decked him, you knocked some sense into him. 
  So, apparently violence is the answer. 
  So he left his wife? 
  I got us reservations at Cicada. 
  You have time if you want to get dolled up. 
  Uh, Jeff, this is Viv. 
  She's one of my students. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Can I use the bathroom? 
  - Of course. 
  You saw where it was when we came in, right? 
  She's just gonna hang out until her dad can pick her up. 
  You can't just take a kid home, can you? 
  Well, I couldn't leave her at school alone. 
  It was getting dark. 
  Well, is there someone else that you can call? 
  I was hoping we could celebrate tonight. 
  Did you finally tell Lily that you're leaving her? 
  Not yet. 
  But I did talk to a divorce attorney, and he says it's just important for me to get my ducks in a row first. 
  What ducks? 
  You know, like, bank accounts, and credit cards. 
  Just stuff like that. 
  Look, I'm sorry I had to ruin tonight, but there'll be plenty of nights out when I'm back in Fitchburg. 
  Um-hmm. 
  - Nope, nope. 
  There's a kid here. 
  - All right. 
  We'll stop. 
  Should I be ready to duck and weave? 
  No. 
  Just be good to her. 
  Good to yourself. 
  I'm gonna go get a drink. 
  - Nice turnout. 
  - Yeah, everything looks great. 
  What do you think of his new piece? 
  I like it. 
  Where we goin' Look, no matter our issues, you're always honest with me. 
  I shouldn't show this tomorrow night, right? 
  I know you're lonely too Hey, looking good. 
  Hey. 
  This is my sister, Jazmin. 
  And Bryan. 
  This is Kamar. 
  He's the owner of the gallery. 
  - I'd love any feedback. 
  - Hmm. 
  I'm sorry to see you're working in wood. 
  I was hoping I'd see some more cast pieces from you. 
  But overall, solid work. 
  Thanks. 
  We don't have to tell nobody Waitin' alone here for you to come home Maybe you should have cast that phallic piece you destroyed. 
  I didn't have the money to. 
  Well, cast or not, you should just own it. 
  Okay? 
  Lots of mediocre art sells for huge bucks. 
  - Thanks a lot, Bryan. 
  - No, that's not what I'm saying. 
  What I mean is, if you stand by it, get a couple critics to agree, everyone will think it's brilliant. 
  Well, I don't need a critic to tell me what I think. 
  I like it. 
  Truly. 
  Tell me It's not your best work. 
  Problem is, is the show is called "8. 
  " Eight pieces of art from 8 L. A. 
  artists. 
  Without this, I only have 7. 
  What if you show one of these? 
  They're not good enough. 
  Can you make something new in the next 24 hours? 
  Yeah. 
  But I'd need help. 
  Come on to me Um-hmm, um (TOILET FLUSHES) 
  Vivian showed up at school today. 
  Everything's fine, I guess. 
  Uh! 
  This is adorbs. 
  - Thanks. 
  - Yeah. 
  You didn't have to fold my clothes. 
  I don't mind. 
  So, Vivian, how do you like your English teacher? 
  - I hear she's a real piece of work. 
  - Watch it. 
  She's making us read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. 
  SPOILER: boring! 
  And racist and it's about a boy so who cares? 
  Okay, first of all, the school board is making you read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, so It's so basic. 
  Yeah, that's the problem with these common core reading lists. 
  I graduated before I read authors who really spoke to me. 
  You know, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, Roxane Gay Angie Thomas? 
  You haven't read The Hate U Give? 
  - Instant classic. 
  - Your dad must be pretty proud of you. 
  Tween badass and all. 
  He is. 
  And he's usually on time. 
  It's not like he forgot or something. 
  He's just been really busy at his work. 
  Hey, Davia, I have those, um, T-shirts I wanted to show you. 
  For the protest. 
  - Oh! 
  - MALIKA: Um-hmm. 
  DAVIA: Right, um the protest in your room. 
  I'll be right back. 
  Slow down. 
  - What's going on? 
  - I think Viv is homeless. 
  She is shoveling food in her mouth and she's carrying around dirty clothes in her backpack. 
  Okay, well, a lot of girls bring extra clothes to school. 
  - She's just taking them home to wash - No. 
  I was homeless, okay. 
  Trust me. 
  Something's going on, here. 
  You need to call child services. 
  You don't know what the story is with her dad, if there even is one. 
  She could be in trouble. 
  Or, he could be at work like she said, and calling someone could really mess things up for them. 
  See, this is the problem with recruiting white college grads to teach at diverse, urban schools. 
  Y'all can't relate to your students, and you have no clue what their real home lives are like. 
  So now you want to educate me. 
  So what is it, Malika? 
  Should I go get a book and figure it out for myself, or should I wait patiently for your next lecture? 
  Why you gotta get defensive? 
  Because you're attacking me when I am just honestly trying to understand. 
  I'm on your side. 
  But it feels like there's nothing I can do to convince you of that. 
  If the truth feels like an attack, you need to check your privilege. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  I didn't know it was a privilege to have a conversation with my friend without feeling patronized or judged. 
  (DOOR SLAMS) 
  Hey, did you see the kid that was here? 
  Uh, yeah. 
  She said her dad was here to get her, and to say thanks. 
  Huh. 
  You know, showing up at school today like every other day doesn't mean she's not homeless. 
  I was in college and living in my car. 
  I never missed a class. 
  I just don't want to call anyone until I know for sure. 
  I know you called CPS on your mom, but that doesn't mean it's the right choice for every kid. 
  Was the system any better for you? 
  'Cause it sure as hell wasn't for me. 
  Hey. 
  What's wrong? 
  Nothing. 
  Just another conversation where someone accuses me of not getting it. 
  Like this sculpture. 
  What is that? 
  I think it's good that you're leaving. 
  It'll be nice for you to be back home. 
  You fit in better. 
  - What's that supposed to mean? 
  - Nothing, I I just Just to be clear, I'm not going back until you leave your wife. 
  I'm not moving to Wisconsin to be your mistress. 
  Every time I hear 'em say my name I don't see no one there Got to say, Gael, your new piece might be my favorite. 
  Where you been hidin' it? 
  - He did it last night. 
  - KAMAR: You did that last night? 
  Yeah. 
  Ah. 
  Never know when the muse will strike, right? 
  Shouldn't take much longer to dry. 
  - Thanks for helping me. 
  - What else would I be doing right now? 
  Besides being fast asleep in my comfy bed? 
  It's gonna be really cool. 
  You're good at this. 
  I haven't been. 
  Honestly, I haven't felt inspired about my art in months. 
  Just feels like another thing on my to-do list. 
  You have a lot on your plate. 
  GAEL: Maybe this whole time, all I needed is you. 
  So, what, I'm like, your muse? 
  If you're up for it. 
  When I see trouble turned around and I walk out (TIMER DINGS) 
  - (CALLIE CLEARS THROAT) 
  - Concrete's ready. 
  Hey. 
  So did you get a chance to meet that lawyer? 
  I did. 
  Um, I'm gonna take the settlement. 
  Why did you change your mind? 
  Honestly, I need the money. 
  It could really put me back on my feet. 
  - And I can pay your back. 
  - That was a gift. 
  Not a loan. 
  Look, if you want to take the settlement, fine, but I'm not taking your money. 
  - Gael - I'm serious. 
  - We need a refill. 
  - JAZMIN: Yeah. 
  (RHYTHMIC SONG BEGINS) 
  RAJ: Doesn't seem like a practical place to keep your valuables. 
  No. 
  Sticky, too. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Oh, Evan came. 
  Sweet of him. 
  - How are you feeling about your pitch? 
  - Well Which is now "New Zip" takes the guesswork out of your next big move. 
  Uh, Speckulate developed something similar a couple of years ago. 
  Evan ultimately pulled the plug. 
  sh1t. 
  Evan killed it. 
  Two years ago. 
  I have another idea, but It's called "Activism. 
  " So you have all these people who want to get involved, but don't know how. 
  And then there's people like you. 
  The activists who have all of these really important causes, but need more people to support them. 
  What if there were an app that connected you to them, and helped you organize? 
  Like a one-stop spot for permits, planning, legal resources, counseling, even crowd-funding. 
  Like, basically organizing the organizers. 
  That would be amazing. 
  But would your boss really get behind something like that? 
  No way. 
  It's interesting and noble, but Speckulate isn't exactly a a civic-minded workplace. 
  I can't imagine Evan green-lighting an app like that. 
  Or Josh even letting him. 
  Well, screw that. 
  It's a great idea. 
  Well, how great of a great idea? 
  I mean, in your expert opinion. 
  Somewhere between the Gutenberg printing press, and sliced bread. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Excuse me, I'll be right back. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Have you talked to your friend about Jesus's tiny houses? 
  Um, yeah. 
  So you're just backing out? 
  - I thought you were managing the project. 
  - I never said that. 
  You think I would give hundreds of thousands of dollars to a kid with no experience. 
  He's got a good business plan. 
  And the permits. 
  For you this is a low-risk investment. 
  Look, I was doing this as a favor. 
  To you. 
  To help you out financially. 
  But, you know, now that you don't need the money Oh, so this is about Jenn. 
  You're punishing this kid because she's pissed at me? 
  I don't want to get between the two of you. 
  Well, you should have thought about that before you started screwing her. 
  Come on, man. 
  Really? 
  What the hell? 
  I just think you owe her an explanation. 
  Your brother doesn't need to worry. 
  I got a plan. 
  Well, thank you so much for all that you're doing for him. 
  - He really appreciates it. 
  - He's a good kid. 
  Tell him he doesn't need to feel guilty. 
  Guilty? 
  About what? 
  You know. 
  Getting a handout. 
  When you get an opportunity, you take it. 
  (UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING) 
  Hey. 
  Surprised to see you here. 
  You said you hated going to parties. 
  Hmm. 
  I'm trying to get out more. 
  Get more involved. 
  I have, um social anxiety. 
  Had it my whole life. 
  First day of kindergarten, I stood by the door the whole day, ready to bolt just in case someone tried to talk to me. 
  One time I threw myself down a garbage chute to avoid a girl that I had a crush on. 
  - Garbage chute? 
  - Yes. 
  I ended up in a dumpster outside. 
  I have a thing with germs, so that was a bad idea. 
  (MARIANA LAUGHS) 
  Sorry. 
  No, it's okay. 
  It's, um it's funny. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  You need to find a way to keep this pitch of Mariana's from happening. 
  Uh, yeah. 
  I made that mistake once. 
  So if you want to stop it, that's your problem. 
  Sure. 
  Until we end up with another Amanda situation on our hands. 
  Look it's pretty obvious that Evan's interest in Mariana isn't just professional. 
  And I don't think the head of HR would want to see Speckulate featured in the next "Me Too" expose. 
  That's rich, coming from you. 
  What's that supposed to mean? 
  Gee, I don't know, Josh. 
  What do you think it means? 
  Just find a way to keep this pitch from happening, or find a reason to fire her if you have to. 
  Okay? 
  By the way, I'm really looking forward to your pitch. 
  Uh, that might have to be postponed. 
  Apparently, my old pitch was an idea you've already heard before. 
  - So, there's a new pitch? 
  - Well, yeah, but Pretty sure it's not something you're gonna be into. 
  Well, there is only one way to find out. 
  Tell me about it. 
  Now? 
  You got me pickin' up my dreams, baby Please baby, this doesn't feel like a dream, baby Am I crazy? 
  This is going really well, right? 
  It is. 
  It's impressive. 
  Especially pulling off a brand new piece overnight. 
  Without any help. 
  I'm gonna grab another drink. 
  You guys, uh Hmm. 
  He, uh always drink this much? 
  - What's your problem with Bryan? 
  - I don't have a problem. 
  But you do. 
  Always picking guys you can't actually get serious about. 
  - Jaz, you barely know him. 
  And we are serious. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  You're not in love with him. 
  And not in danger of falling. 
  It's what you do. 
  I didn't do that with Elijah. 
  Yeah, but you found a way to break it off. 
 
 
 
  - It's complicated. 
  - When isn't it? 
  I mean, have you let yourself feel like that about anyone else since? 
  That's what I thought. 
  You didn't fight for Elijah. 
  Don't let that happen with this one. 
  So, I just pitched "Activism" to Evan. 
  - What? 
  - He asked to hear it. 
  And, anyway Basically, organizing the organizers. 
  I love it. 
  Seriously? 
  I want to get into it tomorrow. 
  Discuss specs for a build. 
  I think it's great, Mariana. 
  Wow. 
  I think you meant, "Wow. 
  That's amazing, Mariana. 
  Congratulations!" Yeah, uh, yeah, definitely. 
  All that. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Don't be so effusive. 
  I'm sorry, I'm, it's, it's very exciting. 
  I just, uh - Raj, what? 
  - I worry about Evan's intentions. 
  Intentions? 
  So he only likes my app because he likes me? 
  No Evan's different around you. 
  He looks right through everyone else. 
  He has social anxiety, for your information. 
  He's here supporting Gael, so, what? 
  He has a crush on him, too? 
  Look, I'm wrong, okay? 
  Probably. 
  I'm sorry, I'm just Projecting? 
  Yeah, 'cause you're the only one who's proven to have intentions. 
  Just sold, man. 
  Really? 
  Who bought it? 
  Said they wanted to remain anonymous. 
  Congratulations. 
  Thanks. 
  You didn't just buy that to pay me back, did you? 
  No Jamal Thompson was shot and killed by police. 
  So if you believe that black lives matter, please come to the protest. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Um, I'd give you one of these, but I'm not the clerk on the case anymore. 
  What happened? 
  Just tried a little too hard to have an influence. 
  - You okay? 
  - Maybe it's better this way. 
  So, can you come to the protest? 
  No, I'm still a clerk in his office. 
  What do you think our chances are? 
  Be honest. 
  I don't think they're good. 
  I don't know. 
  - Do you find it a bit - Threatening? 
  I was gonna say didactic, but - Sure. 
  - I'm not good with big words. 
  - Hey, do you want another - Do you want another - I can get - I can  
  (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
  - It's like our first date all over again. 
  - Oh, I hope not. 
  I'll get the drinks. 
  Hey. 
  Sorry. 
  Didn't mean to scare you. 
  I'm sure you didn't. 
  I just have resting scared face. 
  Plus, I thought you'd left. 
  Uh, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for being an ass the other night. 
  You know, I just love Sumi so much, and I get protective, and I don't know, maybe a little jealous. 
  (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) 
  Why jealous? 
  'Cause you and Sumi are best friends. 
  You know, it could be tough. 
  She's, I don't know. 
  She's my soul mate, and I just can't imagine my life without her. 
  So what if I told you I didn't want to marry Meera. 
  Um. 
  Why not? 
  Because I think I'm still in love with you. 
  It's all good. 
  I don't think you're an ass. 
  In the donkey way, or the butt way, for that matter.

  Caught triple handed. 
  I asked her opinion, okay? 
  It just happened. 
  - Why didn't you ask my opinion? 
  - I did, Bryan. 
  Your answer was, "Take your shirt off. " Did you hook up with her? 
  I'm not gonna talk to you about my relationship with Callie. 
  BRYAN: You told me to trust you. 
  And I want to. 
  But you give me reasons to doubt, Gael. 
  I never should have committed to being exclusive. 
  I'm sorry.

  Look, if this is about my app This is about your spreadsheet. 
  - How did you? 
  - This place is full of computer geniuses. 
  Did you really think a password would keep me out?

  - Yeah. 
  - Is everything okay? 
  - No. 
  CARL: If some deal was made to get the charges against Tate Wilson dropped, no one's saying so. 
  - You don't think it's odd? 
  - I do. 
  It's not the first time some privileged kid gets out of serious charges because his parents are connected. 
  JAMIE: You had something to tell us? 
  Something I did hear from a reliable source that could affect your case. 
  He says that Chief Kelley, the former chief of police when Jamal was shot, didn't suddenly decide to retire. 
  He was forced to. 
  Forced out. 
  Why? 
  There was an I. A. 
  investigation going on about some comments he allegedly made to officers, one of which was, that it's easier and cheaper for the department to let victims of police shootings die. 
  (ELEVATOR DINGS)

  - You said you wanted me to have half. 
  You convinced me that you owed it to me. 
  For cheating on me. 
  And not being there when I needed you the most. 
  Or maybe this is about me moving on with Nathan. 
  That's not what this is about. 
  - Then what is it about? 
  - Me.

  Trying to stop throwing my life away. 
  You spent our entire marriage taking care of yourself. 
  Putting me and Jacob last.
