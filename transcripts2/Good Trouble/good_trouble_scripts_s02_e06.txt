 I am a registered Republican. 
  I'm gonna get a great job, and I will pay you back every penny. 
  - Now that's a power suit. 
  - I haven't gotten the job yet. 
  I really don't want anybody to know about Jacob or that I was in the hospital. 
  You do need someone to talk to. 
  I have you. 
  DAVIA: You remember my mother? 
  Will you stay and have one last drink with me? 
  - Sure. 
  Why not? 
  - Morning. 
  CALLIE: Wake up. 
  Up. 
  ANGELA: But what about this photo of you and Mariana? 
  Can I have everyone's attention? 
  I am not seeing Evan. 
  I'm seeing Raj. 
  I'm so excited for this cruise, Patty. 
  Me, too, Debbie. 
  I can't wait for the all-you-can-eat buffets. 
  Right? 
  Here, Patty. 
  Let me help you unpack your bags. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (GASPS) 
  Is this a new outfit? 
  Yes. 
  For dinner at the captain's table. 
  - ALICE: Fancy. 
  - Well, should you be shopping when money is tight? 
  Yes, and Yes, and I got it on sale. 
  - Oh. 
  On sale? 
  For $1,595. 
  - Well, Debbie, I bought it when I thought I was gonna get a new job. 
  Yes, and maybe if you studied a little harder and spent a little less time on the roof, you would have passed the bar tending exam, and I wouldn't be here paying for our vacation. 
  Yes, and it's great that you don't resent it at all. 
  You don't have to pay me back. 
  We're family. 
  Since, you know, we're family. 
  Well, it's the least I could do after you up and quit your job. 
  Speaking of jobs, have you had any more s*x dreams about your boss? 
  (LAUGHING) 
  Good Trouble 2x06 Twenty-Fine Pa-pa-pa pa-pa-pa, pa, pa Pa-pa-pa pa-pa-pa, pa, pa And then we'll find our peace of mind You and me, bel ami Pa-pa-pa, pa, pa MALIKA: Dear friend, you are invited to a low-key party at The Coterie to celebrate my 25th year of life on this planet. 
  We've all been so busy with our lives, - following our own story lines. 
  - We haven't had our usual family dinners or salons. 
  So as your present to me, I'd love you to share your talents with all of us. 
  Please turn this card over and take this inspiration to prepare some sort of creative expression. 
  - We're just human after all -  
  - Yeah, you can ignite it now  
  - Awaken love  
  - All you have to do is fall  
  - Sister Act? 
  We could dress up as nuns and sing. 
  MALIKA: The idea is to express yourself, because that is what sets us free. 
  Ugh. 
  I thought my birthday parties were obnoxious. 
  So you admit that? 
  "Breathe"? 
  What is that supposed to mean? 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe chill? 
  I'm chill. 
  Well, apparently, I'm not surprising. 
  You know, I once bought oat milk on a whim. 
  Remember that? 
  You know, I don't even know how milk comes from an oak, but I thought, eh, maybe I'll surprise everyone! 
  No offense, but you couldn't even surprise your parents - when you came out. 
  - Fair. 
  Oh, Mariana, what's the most surprising thing you've ever done? 
  Um, I guess my threesome. 
  Okay, swinger. 
  Maybe I'll ask someone normal. 
  Oh, I've done a lot of surprising things. 
  Seriously? 
  'Cause you seem pretty consistent. 
  Oh, you don't know the old Callie. 
  - She once got in a car with a pimp. 
  - Mariana! 
  Who are you people? 
  - DAVIA: So what's your card say? 
  - Sister Act. 
  Hmm. 
  I can see that. 
  I mean, you two have been sort of out of sync, lately. 
  BOTH: No, we haven't. 
  See? 
  Perfectly in sync. 
  (GASPS) 
  'N Sync! 
  We could sing "Bye Bye Bye". 
  You know, it is kind of a lot of pressure to put on us to prepare some sort of performance. 
  - Even if it is your birthday. 
  - Hey! 
  Hey. 
  What's going on? 
  Just talking about how excited we are for your birthday party! 
  Yes. 
  Can't wait. 
  Yeah, I think it's gonna be really fun. 
  Which is what we were all saying. 
  - Wow. 
  Look at the time. 
  - Yeah, I have laundry. 
  - MARIANA: I gotta get to work. 
  Love you. 
  - (ALL CHATTERING) 
  Hey, thanks for not inviting me to your birthday. 
  Sorry. 
  Just trying to keep it small. 
  Oh, I'm not being sarcastic. 
  I'm seriously glad that you didn't invite me. 
  Thank you. 
  Actually, we need someone to run lights and music. 
  What's in it for me? 
  But it's your 25! 
  You know, so we gots to celebrate. 
  Yeah, I'm just not feeling everybody getting turnt. 
  I just want to kick back where we can reconnect. 
  Malika, is that your brother? 
  Yeah. 
  I got him a job here. 
  Girl, what the hell? 
  He tryin' to be Sisqo? 
  - What's going on with - He is finding himself. 
  - Okay. 
  - How is it with you two? 
  - You know. 
  Ebbs and flows. 
  - Is he coming to your party? 
  I don't know. 
  Hey, Dom. 
  You coming to my birthday? 
  Depends. 
  Any surprise guests I need to worry about? 
  Oh, just you. 
  If you show. 
  - All right. 
  I guess I'll be there. 
  - All right. 
  Hey, ladies. 
  - How you doing? 
  - How are you? 
  I'm all right. 
  I better get back to it before this one starts clapping orders at me. 
  And we're flowing. 
  (STRUMMING SOFTLY) 
  Did you tell Malika about Jacob? 
  Or that I was in the hospital? 
  No. 
  I would never tell anyone. 
  Why? 
  Well, maybe it's because you've been hiding in your loft for weeks, and people want to know what's going on with you. 
  - So are you coming? 
  - No. 
  You should. 
  You know, people miss you. 
  You've gotta get back into the world, you know. 
  You're not going to your group therapy and you're not working on your music. 
  All you're doing is whatever that is. 
  All right. 
  Next verse. 
  Okay. 
  "Hey, Malika, don't you seethe, when someone swipes your cold brew, you just gotta breathe. 
  " Come on. 
  I need a catchy hook. 
  How about this? 
  (STRUMMING SOFTLY) 
  I don't know you But I want you - All - All the more for that Words fall through me Okay, we're not singing that, dude. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  "Dude"? 
  Okay, Dennis. 
  Next verse. 
  Um "Hey, Alice, you've gotta just breathe. 
  When we run out of paper, we can wipe with leaves. 
  " Ah? 
  Um (CLEARS THROAT) 
  I need I need to tell you something. 
  Yeah, my song sucks. 
  I know. 
  It's kind of the point. 
  I had s*x with your mom. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - What? 
  Um Why do you hide behind this mop? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  - That's better. 
  - You just want to be on top. 
  I just want to see you. 
  Maybe it's time for a new look. 
  (TUSSLING, CHUCKLING) 
  (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) 
  Um, hey. 
  So, uh I'm wearing a binder. 
  You are? 
  - Can I see it? 
  - Yeah. 
  Does it hurt? 
  Only if I wear it too long. 
  So what does this mean? 
  It means I'm not comfortable with my chest, and this helps me feel more confident. 
  Oh. 
  Did it make you feel uncomfortable  
  - when I touched them before? 
  - No, it's okay. 
  You didn't know. 
  - So, do you want to keep it on? 
  - Yeah. 
  If that's okay? 
  Sure. 
  It actually makes me feel really sexy. 
  (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) 
  - What makes you feel sexy? 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  Probably not saying the word "sexy" so much. 
  Seriously. 
  - I've never really felt sexy. 
  - I think you are. 
  I think you're hot. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  How hot is this? 
  Huh? 
  Do you like that? 
  Do you like that? 
  Hmm? 
  Huh? 
  Oh! 
  (SCOFFS) 
  My neck. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  - Sexy hurts. 
  - (CLEARS THROAT) 
  - What? 
  What's wrong? 
  - I feel like you're making fun of me. 
  I'm making fun of myself. 
  Look, I'm sorry that I'm not comfortable being sexy, and that I'm so unsurprising. 
  - Where are you going? 
  - To get some water. 
  So, this is the first piece of a series I'm gonna do based on the piece that I sold in the group show. 
  Looks like that review got you inspired again. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  - Did you post it to Instagram? 
  - No, I don't like bragging. 
  Hey, bragging's how you build you brand. 
  Get people to follow you. 
  Besides, if you don't want to be at the mercy of critics to make or break you I'm not gonna post naked pictures of myself just to get attention. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  That's not what I'm saying. 
  You just need to let people know who you are. 
  Show 'em your personality. 
  And none of this brooding artist sh1t. 
  You need to create moments, and stories. 
  Oh, now I gotta be entertaining. 
  Yeah. 
  You gotta get people interested in you, so that they can get interested in your art. 
  You need to  
  - Lighten up? 
  - Doesn't hurt. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Well, it's not me. 
  Sorry I'm a brooding artist, but I can't be someone I'm not. 
  So you were just helping Evan with his dating profile. 
  Yes. 
  That's why he asked me to have drinks with him. 
  He said that I'm socially well-adjusted for an engineer. 
  He's got a point. 
  He asked me not to tell anyone, but I should have told you. 
  Well, I understand why you didn't. 
  Everybody's suspicious of his interest in you. 
  I'm really sorry. 
  Me, too. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  - (DOOR OPENS) 
  - Oop. 
  Sorry. 
  Hey. 
  Thought you you were over at Jamie's tonight. 
  - No. 
  I have to study for the bar. 
  - Um, it's okay. 
  My roommates are having poker night, and I should probably be there to make sure no one pees in the plants. 
  - That's a thing? 
  - Unfortunately. 
  - Maybe tomorrow? 
  - Okay. 
  All forgiven? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Good. 
  So, you haven't spent any nights at Jamie's this week. 
  Everything okay? 
  Not here to distract you. 
  Just brought you some dinner. 
  That's sweet. 
  So, what are you doing down here? 
  Um, it's the only semi-quiet place to study. 
  You know where it's really quiet? 
  My place. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Well, it might be quiet, but you are a major distraction. 
  Seems like you've pulled away since I told you I'm a Republican. 
  Are we okay? 
  Yeah. 
  I just like being in my own space. 
  Well, me, too, but you know, if Raj lived alone in a penthouse apartment, I'd be happy to go to his place so you could spend time with your boyfriend. 
  Well, I'm happy to step out. 
  Let you guys have some time alone. 
  Like you did just now. 
  Like I've done many times before. 
  Okay, well, I feel bad kicking you out of our loft so I can have s*x with my boyfriend, so I think maybe we could make a deal that, I don't know, you stay at Jamie's, like, three nights a week. 
  You know, especially 'cause I am paying most of the rent. 
  - I told you I'd pay you back. 
  - I know. 
  It's fine. 
  It's fine. 
  We're family. 
  I don't mind. 
  So, can you spend tomorrow night with Jamie? 
  Sure. 
  Would you mind not leaving your shoes in the middle of the floor? 
  Sure. 
  May be you could fold and put away your laundry instead of dumping it on the couch? 
  I think I can do that. 
  Do you think maybe you can come up with something for us to do for Malika's party since you keep shooting down all of my suggestions? 
  Maybe we could do a scene from "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 
 " - What's that? 
  - It's an old movie. 
  A former child star torments her paraplegic sister in their decaying Hollywood mansion. 
  You can play Jane. 
  Very funny. 
  Okay, well, I'm just waiting for Stacey Abrams to get in the race. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  What about our girl Kamala? 
  So, have you lived here a while? 
  Yeah, um, I work in the theater downstairs. 
  You like this whole communal living? 
  Not really, but I'm not really into that Jonestown sh1t, you know? 
  What does that mean? 
  You know. 
  Jim Jones? 
  Killed all of his cult members when they drank the poisonous punch? 
  - Do you want more wine? 
  - Nah. 
  I'm good. 
  CALLIE: Well, Elizabeth Warren's got the most progressive platform. 
  Um, Bernie. 
  But, do you think the country's ready for socialism? 
  What I don't understand is how you could have so many progressive points of view but still call yourself Republican. 
  Don't say you're a fiscal conservative, because deficits have grown the most under Republican presidents. 
  Let's remember, the Republican party was formed to abolish slavery. 
  Okay, look, there's no question under this President, the Party is not what it was meant to be. 
  - Which is? 
  - About individual freedom and accountability, to protect local power, not a big centralized government telling people how to live. 
  The reliance on private spending, which is more efficient than public spending. 
  And to extend democracy, at home and abroad. 
  Sounds like you had that rehearsed. 
  Well, I thought the subject might come up. 
  Do you think the Party's only changed under the current President? 
  Even it is has, it is ethical to stay in a Party for what it was meant to be, rather than the hateful party it's become? 
  So guilty by association. 
  You think I'm unethical. 
  Well, none of the Democratic candidates are proposing that the government take control of industry and capital. 
  Which is the definition of socialism. 
  It's just Republican party propaganda. 
  I mean, what they want is to reduce economic inequality. 
  I think that the country is ready for living wage, free college, and healthcare for all. 
  - TOLU: I feel that. 
  - (ALL CHATTERING) 
  I'm I'm sorry. 
  Is this a political debate or a birthday party? 
  - TOLU: Hear, hear. 
  - Welcome to The Coterie. 
  (ALL CHATTERING, LAUGHING) 
  TOLU: See, it's your first time. 
  Where's Dennis? 
  I'm sure Dennis wanted to be here. 
  He's just been really busy, you know, with his music. 
  (FUNK MUSIC PLAYING) 
  - (GLASS CLINKING) 
  - Okay, so before we all get too lit - Hey! 
  - (LAUGHTER) 
  I wanted to say a few words. 
  (SIGHS) 
  I wanted to use my birthday to thank you all. 
  When Alice brought me into The Coterie, she literally carved out a piece of her loft to give me a roof over my head. 
  (EXHALES) 
  But she and all of you gave me so much more than that. 
  You gave me my first real home. 
  My chosen family. 
  (EXHALES) 
  Without you all, I wouldn't be graduating from college soon. 
  - Go, sis! 
  - All right, all right. 
  Malika's smart. 
  - She's smart. 
  - (CLAPPING, CHEERING) 
  And I never would have met this wonderful beautiful man. 
  Hey, now! 
  Hey, now! 
  - (ALL LAUGHING) 
  - Or have been able to share my handsome, sweet, dope-ass brother Dom  
  - with all of you. 
  - (GUESTS EXCLAIM) 
  I'm blessed, and I'm so grateful. 
  Thank you all for being here. 
  And, I can't wait to see what y'all cooked up for us. 
  - Well, as long as expectations are low. 
  - Really low. 
  - Whoa. 
  What are you doing now, baby? 
  - YARI: Woo! 
  She ready! 
  Work it! 
  Okay, so just so no one has to feel the pressure of going first,  
  - me and my girls got you. 
  - ISAAC: Oh, yeah! 
  (APPLAUSE) 
  Growing up as a kid, I hated my dark skin. 
  And if I could be transparent, even now as a grown woman, I have to constantly reprogram my thinking. 
  Years of being told I was not the standard for beauty, but, see, that was a lie. 
  Which is why I chose to rewrite my own narrative. 
  - "Dear Black Girl,  
  - (STOMPING) 
  we are warriors whose spirits can't be crushed. 
  We speak up when told we're too much. 
  We forgive when our black men dismiss degrade and can't see that we are not the ugly ducklings, but the swan princess the Nubian goddess, the reflection of our ancestors the made in His image. 
  When society tries to pin light versus dark skin we remind them that every shade of chocolate is divinely crafted. 
  " - Black Girl Magic is more than a hashtag. 
  - (ALL SNAPPING) 
  - DAVIA: Yes! 
  - (ALL CLAPPING) 
  "It is a movement. 
  A statement like Maxine Waters claiming our power. 
  Moving through this world unapologetically. 
  Degree holding with our heads held high. 
  Melanin moisturize, big hips, thick thighs, hair free and natural or wrapped in a protective style. 
  Dear Black Girl, you better recognize We are the trailblazers. 
  Everybody" - ELIJAH: Yes! 
  - " wants to be us. 
  " - (ALL CHEERING, CLAPPING) 
  - ISAAC: Come on, preach! 
  Come on! 
  (CLAPPING CONTINUES) 
  Whoo! 
  "So to all my sistas as we continue this process of loving our skin start with this. 
  Look at yourself in the mirror. 
  This is me. 
  The chocolate beauty deserving and saying, I am Queen. 
  Dear Black Girl know that you - You are everything. 
  " - (ALL SNAPPING) 
  (ALL CHEERING, CLAPPING) 
  - I'm sorry I'm late. 
  - You're here. 
  That's what matters. 
  What's this? 
  Just sick of looking at the drywall. 
  I miss you. 
  I don't want to pry into whatever's going on, but it would mean a lot if you came to my party tonight. 
  We saved you a seat. 
  Right there. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Well, I think I speak for everyone when I say, Dennis,  
  - it's damned good to see you, man. 
  - Woo! 
  ALL: Yes! 
  - Cheers. 
  - Cheers. 
  Hey, I'm gonna go get a sweater. 
  I'm cold. 
  - Is that new? 
  - Yeah. 
  I went shopping. 
  You can afford to buy clothes when you're having to pay more of the rent? 
  Yes, Callie. 
  We all know how responsible you are with your money, but. 
  . 
  I've been working hard, and this is how I treat myself. 
  Yeah, it's also how you got yourself into debt. 
  - That's not true. 
  That is not true. 
  - It does. 
  Well - Especially in the country. 
  - Wow. 
  JAMIE: Yes. 
  So why'd you all choose communal living? 
  - Oh, I - Well, Mariana chose for us. 
  Because Callie left it all up to me and she couldn't afford much. 
  And 'cause she had a massive crush on Gael and was planning on making him her new boyfriend. 
  Until you beat me to it. 
  Well, uh, somebody's gotta go second, right? 
  - Oh, yes. 
  - (CLAPPING) 
  Not an easy act to follow, but I will do my best. 
  - MAN: Very true. 
  - WOMAN: Yes! 
  - It's a very tough act to follow. 
  - Um So, my inspiration was "Lighten Up". 
  - Huh. 
  - Uh, so I wrote a little something about the important role that light plays in art. 
  Oh, no, Well, first - Ooh, yeah! 
  - Yes! 
  Now it's a party! 
  Okay, we wrote this for a purpose To motivate you at this time With this hypnotizing bass line Please feel free to lose your mind And get high, get money, get s*x, get real All intertwined Oh, yeah, this is stadium music Fifty-thousand at a time Let's get right, let's get right Let's get right, okay, okay Let's get right, let's get right Let's get right, okay, okay All the girls want, Hot-n-fun All they looking for is, hot-n-fun All they ask for is, hot-n-fun They keep wanting that, hot-n-fun Look at you, look at me Look at you, look at me Hot-n-fun, hot-n-fun (CHATTERING, LIGHT CLAPPING) 
  So, our inspiration was "Sister Act", and we are going to be doing improv, which was Callie's idea, because she shot down all of mine. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Malika's party is tomorrow night, and we still have nothing prepared, because you keep shooting down all of my ideas. 
  That's 'cause your ideas are either silly or too much work. 
  Silly how? 
  "Mr. 
  Sister"? 
  No one wants to see us as drag kings. 
  Okay, well, you come up with something that takes absolutely no preparation, then. 
  How about improv? 
  So, can we get any suggestions from the audience? 
  Ooh! 
  Sisters on a cruise. 
  Ha! 
  Yeah, that's good. 
  Okay. 
  Fine. 
  But remember that in improv, it's "Yes, and" which might be hard for the queen of no. 
  Also, Raj is spending the night tomorrow night, so you are going to Jamie's. 
  - Are you listening? 
  - Yes, and goodnight. 
  Yes, and maybe if you studied a little harder, and spent a little less time on the roof, you would have passed the bar tending exam, and I wouldn't be here paying for our vacation. 
  - This is real, right? 
  - Oh, yeah, it definitely is. 
  CALLIE: You know, we're family. 
  Speaking of jobs, have you had any more s*x dreams about your boss? 
  And, scene. 
  - (LIGHT APPLAUSE) 
  - (SOFT LAUGHTER) 
  WOMAN: Got good at the end, there. 
  So (CLEARS THROAT) 
  That was, uh, s That is interesting. 
  Th That was all made up. 
  Yeah. 
  Seemed made up. 
  Should we just get this over with? 
  You had s*x with my mom? 
  All right, I was wasted. 
  - When did this happen? 
  - The The first night that she was here. 
  I woke up in the morning, and she was in my bed. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - (GROANS SOFTLY) 
  (LAUGHING CONTINUES) 
  Oops, I'm sorry. 
  It's not funny. 
  No, I-I-I'm I'm sorry. 
  Listen, Dennis. 
  You did not have s*x with my mother. 
  Okay? 
  Malika brought her home, and I spent all night holding her head over the toilet while she barfed out her Botox. 
  - Then why was she in my bed? 
  - I know my mother. 
  She was trying to make you think that you had s*x so that you'd go back for seconds. 
  God, I had no idea she was that desperate to get laid. 
  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
  Are you okay? 
  No, no, no, no. 
  I'm I'm not I'm not okay. 
  I just hated myself thinking that I had done that to you. 
  Thinking that I had ruined any chance of Any chance of what? 
  Of you ever trusting me. 
  Don't worry. 
  I trust you. 
  You're my best friend. 
  So, my card said "Breathe", - and I don't know why. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  But I wrote this song, and spoiler alert, it's pretty lame. 
  (STRUMMING SOFTLY) 
  I don't know you But I want you All the more for that BOTH: Falling slowly Eyes that know me And I can't go back Moods that take me And erase me And I'm painted black Well you have suffered enough And warred with yourself It's time that you won  
  BOTH: Take this sinking boat And point it home We've still got time Raise your hopeful voice You have a choice You've made it now Falling slowly Sing your melody I'll sing it loud  
  (APPLAUSE, CHEERING) 
 
 
 
  And that is called acting. 
  Are we okay? 
  What? 
  Yeah. 
  sh1t. 
  That means I'm last. 
  Better go get ready. 
  Wait, get ready for what? 
  By the way, you might want to check your phone. 
  You got a text from Evan. 
  - (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) 
  - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  - What are you doing? 
  - Come on. 
  I, uh brought you something. 
  Um, I'm I'm not a poet, by any means. 
  At all. 
  Like I cannot do what you do. 
  - I'll let him use you, baby. 
  - (LAUGHTER) 
  But, um - Hey, here it goes. 
  - Hold on, hold on. 
  I got you. 
  - (LIGHTS CLICK ON) 
  - Ooh. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) 
  "With essential potential, a new cause worth a fight, unanimous need, unexpected indeed, all at first sight. 
  Entangled limbs and sudden whims, no need to be polite. 
  Ebony whispers and lip quivers, gently into the night. 
  A new dawn we rise and compromise, and prove the world that we're right. 
  My heart is yours, provocateur. 
  Bringing darkness into light. 
  " - ALL: Aw! 
  - DAVIA: Snap it, y'all, snap it. 
  - (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) 
  - DAVIA: Poetry. 
  Poetry. 
  Snap it! 
  Bang bang boom  
  - (GUESTS SCREAMING JOYFULLY) 
  - WOMAN: Oh my God! 
  I won't be your waiting hand  
  - I won't be your stepping stone

  - Nothing's gonna stop me

  - Bang bang boom  
  - (CHEERING)

  (ALL CHEERING, CLAPPING) 
  Woo! 
  Yes! 
  Yes! 
  Now that was surprising. 
  Girl. 
  Oh, my God! 
  (LAUGHING) 
  (CLAPPING CONTINUES) 
  Thanks so much. 
  See ya. 
  So - (KEYS CLATTER) 
  - What'd you think? 
  I think It was hot. 
  Really? 
  Yeah. 
  So Is this what you want? 
  For me to be more femme? 
  'Cause that was really hard to learn, and I honestly don't think that I could ever  
  - do that again without blowing out a knee. 
  - Hey, hey, hey. 
  What makes you think I want you to be more femme? 
  'Cause you're, like presenting more masc, and  
  - You just said that was hot. 
  - Yeah. 
  Alice, what was hot was your confidence. 
  You weren't making fun of yourself or your sexuality. 
  Dude, you were like Beyonce. 
  You took your space and you owned it. 
  And you were vulnerable. 
  That's all I really want. 
  When you make jokes when we're in bed, it just pushes me away. 
  Okay. 
  I can work on that. 
  I can work on it, too. 
  I know that I push you away. 
  Intimacy is scary as hell. 
  But it can also be super sexy. 
  He wasn't asking me if I was DTF. 
  He wanted to know what it meant. 
  Did you really just move in here because you wanted to sleep with Gael? 
  No. 
  We needed to find a place that we could afford. 
  And I never hooked up with him. 
  I haven't slept with anyone since I've been in LA. 
  Except you. 
  Oh, well There was this What? 
  - Threesome with a really nice couple. 
  - Uh Okay. 
  We'll circle back to that later, but I have a question. 
  Did you know Evan wanted to talk to you about his dating profile when he asked you to have drinks? 
  - No. 
  - You went anyway? 
  Okay, well, if Evan asked you to have a drink, what would you say? 
  - That's different. 
  - Why? 
  Because you're a man? 
  - Yes. 
  - Okay. 
  Wow. 
  That is incredibly sexist. 
  You really buy this dating profile excuse? 
  He's so obviously into you, Mariana. 
  Well, if he's into me, I'm not into him. 
  And I announced to everyone at Speckulate that you're my boyfriend. 
  Yeah, well, it's pretty obvious I'm not your type. 
  - What? 
  - I'm not a rich CEO, or a hot, brooding sculptor artist,  
  - or a couple  
  - You know what? 
  If you can't believe that I wanna be with you, nothing I can say will ever convince you. 
  And I'm done trying. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  (DOOR SLAMS) 
  - You leaving? 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm sorry I didn't do my thing tonight. 
  I will tell you my secret. 
  Soon. 
  - Okay. 
  - Happy birthday. 
  Thank you. 
  Mm, love you. 
  Yeah. 
  Love you, too. 
  Appreciate you coming. 
  Did you have fun? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it's nice to see all the people you have, who love you. 
  I can why you didn't need me and Mom. 
  You got a family. 
  You are my family. 
  After losing Mom, I realized I've had a lot of regrets. 
  And now it's too late. 
  I thought that by reaching out to our father, maybe we could have some type of family. 
  Ah, look, we got each other. 
  And that's enough for me. 
  And that is the best present I could ask for at this birthday. 
  Truly. 
  I love you. 
  And I'm still taller. 
  Aw, man, yo! 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yo. 
  I gotta  
  - No, you didn't. 
  - I sure did. 
  - Are you serious? 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  But check out all the likes and comments you're getting. 
  Check out this one, asking when your next show is. 
  See? 
  This is what I'm talking about. 
  This is you. 
  Just more of you than you're usually willing to put out there. 
  - Seriously? 
  - Let's do it. 
  - Yeah. 
  Let's do it. 
  - All right. 
  Step into my barber shop. 
  All right. 
  All right, y'all. 
  So I've had my hair long since college. 
  And it's time for a new look. 
  - You ready for this? 
  - Yeah, let's do it. 
  - (SNIPPING) 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Getting weaker. 
  Let me see. 
  - (LAUGHING) 
  Too late. 
  - What's that? 
  - This is my voter registration stub. 
  I've had this in my wallet since I was 18 and registered as a Republican. 
  What are you doing? 
  You are right. 
  You know, if I don't believe in what the Party stands for in this moment, I shouldn't be a part of it. 
  However  
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  that doesn't mean I'm turning into a liberal. 
  But seriously, I'm I'm open to listening. 
  If you are. 
  Well, I think Raj and I just broke up, thanks to you. 
  - Let's not do this here. 
  - Why not? 
  - Everyone here knows our business. 
  - Thanks to you. 
  Because you told everyone I moved us in here so I could smash Gael. 
  And that I had a s*x dream about my boss. 
  Yeah, and you told everyone that I didn't pass the bar. 
  - (ARGUING CONTINUES) 
  - I got ten bucks on the little one. 
  I don't know. 
  Callie look like she got hands. 
  I'm sorry, okay? 
  I screwed up. 
  I'm not perfect. 
  Oh. 
  Did you hear that? 
  Miss Judgmental just admitted that she's not perfect. 
  Yeah, and Miss "I don't mind, we're family" wants to kick me out of our loft. 
  That's not true. 
  I just asked if you would spend the night with Jamie. 
  - Yeah, maybe I'll move in with Jamie. 
  - Well, go right ahead. 
  - Okay. 
  - Where are you going? 
  - I'm not doing this, Mariana. 
  - Stop  
  - (MARIANA YELPS) 
  - (SPLASHING) 
  Yes! 
  Now that's some good theater!

  Cray.

  - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  What's going on? 
  Uh, we fell in. 
  Listen, um I'm sorry. 
  You're right. 
  This is my issue. 
  From now on, Hot Raj is gonna be Hot Confident Raj. 
  That is hot. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  - Now, here. 
  Help me out.

  It looks good. 
  You want some of mine? 
  Well, don't just stand there! 
  Get in!

  Do it! 
  So why don't you?
