 JACK: It's okay. 
  Take the field. 
  Let's go, now. 
  - Come on, now. 
  Okay. 
  - One ball, one strike, one out, one run Jack, he had the bat and here's what he done - (excited chatter, applause) 
  - JACK: Here we go, Mac. 
  BOZER: Okay, okay. 
  Let's go, Mac. 
  All on you now, brother. 
  It's going, it's going Let's go, baby. 
  BOZER: All right. 
  Okay, okay, okay! 
  (cheering) 
  Run, run, run, run! 
  Let's go! 
  Take two! 
  Take two! 
  Take two! 
  All the way, Riley, all the way! 
  - Get down! 
  - UMPIRE: Out! 
  Get down! 
  Get down, Riley! 
  UMPIRE: You're out! 
  JACK: No! 
  (grunts) 
  Okay. 
  That's-that's all right. 
  Let's go. 
  We're all right. 
  (clapping) 
  Hey, all right, come on. 
  Get in here. 
  Huddle up for a second now. 
  Now, listen. 
  Last time we played the NSA Listening Post #27 Panthers, we were pretty pathetic. 
  MATTY: We're 14 runs behind, Jack. 
  I think "pathetic" applies here, too. 
  Wah-wah. 
  Nobody likes a Debbie Downer. 
  Okay? 
  I'll handle this. 
  What I'm saying is: we still have a chance to win here. 
  MacGYVER: Oh, man, I don't know. 
  Look at the score, the inning. 
  The base-out situation, I'd say current win expectancy is See there? 
  See there? 
  Mac's got the right idea. 
  His expectancy is for us to win. 
  - See that? 
  - You didn't hear what I said. 
  Well, we're not gonna do that if everybody's out there playing their own game. 
  As you know, softball is a team sport, obviously. 
  But if you take the word "team" apart, you still have "me. 
  " A-And a "T" and an "A. 
  " Jack, are you trying to say there's no "I" in "team"? 
  I don't know. 
  What I'm trying to say is that "team" also spells "meat. 
  " As in, dead meat, as in, the you know, Panthers are-are dead meat. 
  It's-it's a motivational speech. 
  Help me out here. 
  This is a terrible motivational speech. 
  This is supposed to be a motivational speech? 
  - UMPIRE: Take the field! 
  Come on. 
  - MATTY: Wrap it up, Lombardi. 
  Any longer and we forfeit for delay of game. 
  Lombardi was a football coach, thank you very much. 
  Matty, yes. 
  - "Never give up" on three. 
  - (phone chimes) 
  Everybody in here. 
  One - Everybody in here. 
  - MATTY: This is Webber. 
  That means you, young lady, thank you. 
  And ALL: One, two We have to forfeit. 
  No, Matty, come on. 
  I'm the skipper here. 
  Okay, well, I'm the skipper of our other ship, and something's come up. 
  Something big. 
  MATTY: Phoenix just intercepted intel that a terrorist group known as "Omnus" is gearing up for a major attack. 
  Omnus? 
  - Are they new? 
  - Very. 
  They've been on our radar for about four months, and they've been pretty active ever since. 
  JACK: Uh, hold on. 
  Let's go back to the "major attack" part. 
  Any chance you can give us the what, where, when, how? 
  Well, our best bet at getting that info is tracking down the man that they want killed. 
  In the same intercept that alerted us of this attack, we learned that Omnus has offered $10 million for the assassination of someone who they code-named "the Architect. 
  " While the identity of the Architect remains a mystery, the identity of the assassin hired to kill him is not. 
  - Murdoc. 
  - Of course it's Murdoc. 
  RILEY: Who smiles in a mug shot? 
  BOZER: But why would someone try to hire Murdoc when he's behind bars? 
  'Cause while we may know Captain Banana Boat's all locked up, nobody else does. 
  As far as the rest of the criminal underworld is concerned, Murdoc's still lurking from the shadows. 
  So, if we can I. D. 
  this Architect that Murdoc was hired to kill, maybe we can use the information to get ahead of whatever Omnus is planning. 
  Agreed. 
  But I. D. 
  'ing the Architect isn't gonna be easy. 
  Yeah, because the only people that know who he is are Omnus. 
  And it's not like they're willingly gonna give that information up to anyone but Murdoc. 
  Right. 
  Actually, I I think I know how we're gonna do this. 
  How? 
  What's the one thing everyone knows about Murdoc? 
  He's not a good-looking guy. 
  BOZER: Uh, nothing? 
  I mean, we're not even sure if his real name is Murdoc. 
  (snaps fingers) 
  Exactly. 
  He's obsessively secretive. 
  So, if no one but us knows that he's captured, and no one but us knows what he looks like, I was thinking: if they want Murdoc let's give 'em Murdoc. 
  (door buzzes) 
  Listen, Highlights, whatever snarky comment you're about to make, I've heard it a million times before. 
  And I don't have time for it now. 
  I'm Director Webber, head of the Phoenix Foundation. 
  Ah, yes. 
  You're Patricia's replacement. 
  But just so we're clear, Director Webber, I have nothing disparaging to say to you. 
  It's quite the contrary. 
  See, I know what it's like to be different. 
  But because what makes me different is all up here, I have learned to hide it from the world. 
  Mostly. 
  You haven't been afforded that same luxury. 
  I can't imagine the strength that takes. 
  You have my admiration. 
  That's sweet. 
  I don't believe a word of it. 
  Flattery, like insults, will get you nowhere with me. 
  Ooh, I like her, MacGyver. 
  I like her a lot. 
  So, to what do I owe the pleasure? 
  I know that you didn't drag me away from The Bold and The Beautiful just to introduce me to the new boss. 
  A terrorist organization has hired you to kill someone. 
  - Ooh. 
  - Phoenix intercepted the offer. 
  And we need to capture, not kill, the intended mark. 
  So, you're going to (chuckles) 
  let me out on a little field trip? 
  Oh, no, not on your life. 
  I'm going in your place, and you are gonna teach me how to be you. 
  (chuckles) 
  (laughing) 
  You want you think that (laughing): Oh, MacGyver. 
  You are so delightful. 
  As hilarious as that idea is, for me, that's gonna be a hard pass. 
  Come on. 
  Don't you want to see if I can pull this off? 
  (groans softly) 
  Well, I do love watching a bloody car wreck as much as the next guy. 
  Okay, more than the next guy. 
  But even if you could pose as me long enough to convince Omnus to tell you the secret identity of the Architect such a cute nom de guerre, by the way I have absolutely no reason to help you. 
  It's simply a matter of motivation. 
  I don't have any. 
  MacGyver, leave the room. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  - It's not a request. 
  Leave now. 
  I'd like to talk to him alone. 
  She told you. 
  (door buzzes) 
  So, what's the play here, boss lady? 
  You gonna force me to sit in silence till I get so bored that I agree to help you? 
  No, I was just making a point. 
  That you'd get uncomfortable and talk before I would. 
  Oh. 
  (laughs) 
  How very 48 Laws of Power of you. 
  Just proving that you are more human than you'd like to admit. 
  Speaking of proof that you're a human Who might that be? 
  You know exactly who that is. 
  He's your son. 
  And you think that means what to me, exactly? 
  Pay attention, Matilda. 
  In case you hadn't noticed, I am rocking a rather serious case of antisocial personality disorder. 
  So what makes you think that I care whether some child lives or dies? 
  (scoffs) 
  You want people to think you're not human, Murdoc, but you are. 
  If you weren't, you wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to hide your son in one of the most expensive private schools in Switzerland. 
  You pay for his room, his board, his education. 
  (gasps) 
  He even gets gifts on Christmas. 
  Makes sense that you want to keep your son safe. 
  He's an innocent in a world of dangerous predators, who wouldn't think twice about going after him if they knew that he belonged to you. 
  If they knew that he existed. 
  Are you threatening a child? 
  (bangs on table) 
  No. 
  I'm threatening you. 
  We can't leave the boy vulnerable. 
  Phoenix is taking him into protective custody as we speak. 
  But what happens next is up to you. 
  Help us and little Murdoc Jr. 
  never has to know what Daddy really does. 
  But refuse, and, well, I think your son deserves to know the truth, don't you? 
  I'll give you 60 seconds to consider. 
  And then I want a decision. 
  (door buzzes) 
  What'd he say? 
  MURDOC (singsongy): Oh, MacGyver. 
  Let's get to work. 
  (door buzzes) 
  MURDOC: So, first things first, we need to lose that ridiculous jacket. 
  First, you're gonna answer some of my questions. 
  How do you contact your clients? 
  Hmm. 
  - How do you accept a job? 
  - Usually by saying yes. 
  How do you target a mark? 
  (imitates gunshot) 
  See, my methods are easy to explain. 
  What's hard is teaching a Boy Scout like you how to go convince a client that you're a cold-blooded killer. 
  Okay, then. 
  Tell me how. 
  Well, I can't tailor the suit until I see how it fits. 
  So, we're gonna do a little trial run first. 
  Something completely unrelated to your issues with Omnus. 
  And seriously lose the ridiculous jacket. 
  (over earpiece): Now, the people that you're looking for should be at a table near the back. 
  Try to remember, MacGyver, you're not here to get a cat out of a tree, you're here to get a name to turn into worm food, mm-kay? 
  Those two want to hire a hit man? 
  They look so normal. 
  What should I call you? 
  I've collected many names, but I've always been partial to Murdoc. 
  MURDOC: Good boy. 
  Now get them to tell you a story. 
  Why are we here? 
  Our daughter, Rachel was murdered last year. 
  That's that's her and Brett. 
  Her husband. 
  We know he did it. 
  So do the police. 
  But they couldn't find the murder weapon or enough evidence to charge him. 
  He beat her. 
  The detective that came to the house cried when he told us. 
  They wouldn't even let us see her face. 
  MURDOC: Lock up your feelings, MacGyver. 
  They came for a killer, not some hero. 
  I can handle this for you. 
  We just need to settle on my fee. 
  I'm sorry, we're I thought you were No, there must be some kind of mistake. 
  (door buzzes) 
  You kill people for free?! 
  Sometimes. 
  Oh, no. 
  Poor MacGyver didn't have all the information? 
  Get used to it. 
  You almost never have all the information, okay? 
  Clients lie, jobs go sideways, things change. 
  You have to improvise. 
  Come on, isn't that supposed to be, like, your thing? 
  Besides, it was so much fun watching you figure it out for yourself. 
  Teach a man to fish and all that. 
  The truth is you know this you lost that job long before you asked about a fee. 
  See, Mr. 
  and Mrs. 
  Morris, they came in that restaurant looking for a dangerous predator. 
  We all have millions of years of evolution telling us how to spot one. 
  If you don't make something deep within them crawl the moment you open your mouth, they're gonna know you're not the real deal. 
  You're not just starring in some middle school play, MacGyver. 
  It's not enough to pretend to be me, you have to become me. 
  Otherwise, Omnus is gonna sniff you out for the fake that you are, and introduce you to the afterlife. 
  That's my job. 
  Remember? 
  So, sit back, and let me teach you what you need to know. 
  First, you have to learn to become a shadow in the bright sunlight. 
  That means you have to take great pains not to leave behind a trail of any kind. 
  Nothing financial, biological or digital. 
  MacGYVER: I'm a trained operative. 
  - I know how to cover my tracks. 
  - Sure. 
  But simply knowing how to be invisible isn't enough. 
  If you're gonna walk a mile in my skin, you have to believe that what you're doing isn't just fun and lucrative, it's also right. 
  Murder for hire as a moral imperative? 
  I don't buy it. 
  When I was three, I ate my first and last peanut. 
  Oh, this should be riveting. 
  Patience. 
  I was at a baseball game. 
  My father loved peanuts. 
  I loved watching him crack open the shells. 
  I remember putting it in my mouth, the feel of the salt against my tongue, the way that it snapped when I first bit down. 
  But, see, my parents, they didn't know that I was deathly allergic. 
  The reaction was almost instantaneous. 
  And it was violent, and I nearly died. 
  (chuckles) 
  So the first time we met, I could have stopped you with a Snickers? 
  (chuckles) 
  Perhaps. 
  Don't miss my point, Boy Scout. 
  I didn't die, even though I should have, even though I don't have the enzymes necessary to break down the allergens. 
  Somehow, my immune system saved my life. 
  See that's what we are, MacGyver. 
  We're two sides of the world's immune system. 
  We target people that make society sick, and we stop them. 
  I stop them by putting them in a cage. 
  You stop them by putting them in the ground. 
  Whose method's more efficient? 
  Sure, you can say that killing is wrong and life is precious and death is this tragedy. 
  But you feel that way because you're not looking at it from the right perspective. 
  It's a lot to take in, I know, but believe me, MacGyver, you and I basically have the same job. 
  See, the difference is that when you cage one of your cancer cells, they call you a hero. 
  When I kill one, they call me a psychopath. 
  You are a psychopath. 
  By your definition, maybe, but I'm not the one who threatened a child to get you to do what I want. 
  - Yeah, that - Oh, see? 
  That is a dangerous two-way street, MacGyver. 
  See, I know that your sweet mother has passed, and you have my condolences. 
  But dear old daddy's still alive and well. 
  I wonder what he's doing today. 
  Oh, I think it's his fishing day. 
  (choking) 
  That's my boy. 
  (straining) 
  - Yes. 
  See, MacGyver? 
  - (panting) 
  You are a killer, just like me. 
  And the sooner you accept that my way is the right way it is the only way the sooner you're gonna be ready. 
  (phone chimes) 
  Message from the boss? 
  Yeah. 
  (sighs) 
  Omnus has moved up the meeting. 
  Well, fingers crossed that you've learned enough, MacGyver, because it's showtime. 
  (tires screeching) 
  You still got five minutes to change your mind about this, Mac; you sure you want to do this? 
  The Architect is the key to stopping Omnus's attack. 
  The only person he'd give his real name out to is Murdoc. 
  We don't even know who you're meeting. 
  How can we be sure you're not walking into another trap? 
  We can't. 
  That's why you're gonna be there with ten Phoenix agents. 
  Last time I checked, Phoenix agents ain't given acting lessons, all right? 
  They're not gonna be able to help you pull off a convincing performance. 
  You sure you can fool his contact? 
  Only one way to find out. 
  All right. 
  Well, like you said, you only have to be this lunatic for, like, ten minutes. 
  But after you get the intel on the Architect, we're crashing the party you hear me? 
  Hey, you hear me? 
  All of us. 
  Yeah, I hear you. 
  JACK (over earpiece): Team One in position. 
  Excuse me. 
  No one's allowed back here without an I MacGYVER: I'm sorry. 
  Sounded like you were about to say "I. 
  D. 
  badge"? 
  But, you see, I've got one. 
  Now, you're gonna take a long walk and forget all about me. 
  Or does this end another way? 
  Good. 
  (whistling) 
  JACK: Do you have any idea how unsettling that is? 
  Sorry, getting into character. 
  Well, it sounds to me like you're already very much in character. 
  MacGYVER: Approaching the elevator. 
  (elevator bell dings) 
  Jack, Teams Two and Three are reporting no movement. 
  - You got anything? 
  - JACK: Nah. 
  Team One, we got squat. 
  Which is starting to make my spidey senses tingle like crazy. 
  (elevator bell dings) 
  Any activity on the 24th floor? 
  No, nothing. 
  (elevator chiming) 
  (phone ringing) 
  - Whose cell phone is that? 
  - JACK: Mine's on silent. 
  Mac didn't even bring his. 
  I think it's coming from the elevator. 
  (phone continues ringing) 
  There's a burner in the elevator. 
  I thought this was supposed to be a face-to-face meeting. 
  Yeah, so did I. 
  Mac, leave it. 
  There's no telling what answering that phone would trigger. 
  Don't answer the phone, man. 
  (phone continues ringing) 
  Hello. 
  THE CLIENT (over phone): Murdoc. 
  It's been a while. 
  We haven't spoken since the El Salvador job. 
  When was Murdoc last in El Salvador? 
  Now, why would you want to play games before we exchange pleasantries? 
  There was no El Salvador job. 
  We've never spoken before. 
  THE CLIENT: You'll have to excuse my paranoia. 
  You can't be too careful. 
  You'll find only one number in the contact list on the phone you're holding. 
  Use it to send proof of death. 
  And the target? 
  The dossier is also on the phone. 
  The clock on the contract is 12 hours. 
  Payment will be made in full once we receive Proof of death. 
  You want me to fill out a W-9, too? 
  - You've picked up a tail. 
  - Who? 
  Unidentified operators in your area. 
  Are you kidding me? 
  We just got made. 
  THE CLIENT: This does not inspire confidence, Murdoc. 
  We chose you for this job because discretion is mission critical. 
  You chose me because I'm the best. 
  I'll lose the tail and contact you when the job is done. 
  JACK: How'd they do that, keyhole satellite? 
  Who the hell are we dealing with here, man? 
  (device beeps) 
  (elevator bell rings) 
  - (high-pitched electrical whine) 
  - (groans) 
  Mac? 
  Mac? 
  Excuse me. 
  (elevator bell dings) 
  (car alarm chirps) 
  Mac? 
  Mac! 
  (engine starts) 
  (tires screeching) 
  (parking gate snaps) 
  (car horns blaring) 
  Okay. 
  Okay, Matty. 
  He just ditched his comms and stole a car. 
  I think he's trying to sell the idea he's losing a tail. 
  We need to get air assets up right now. 
  MATTY: Jack, I know you're not gonna want to hear this, but we sent MacGyver in to be Murdoc, and that's exactly what he's doing. 
  So have a little faith in our boy and come back to the ranch. 
  Okay. 
  I hope you know what you're doing, pal. 
  Goodness. 
  Man brutally murders his wife, gets away with it, and now he's out here golfing with some other woman. 
  Couldn't hate this guy more. 
  He hasn't gotten away with it yet. 
  Matty's giving us a chance to prove he did it. 
  Hey, what's this? 
  Something Mac made me. 
  Boosts Bluetooth signals over 100 meters, makes hacking way easier, so, we can sit back while Brett's on his call and snoop through his phone. 
  Okay. 
  I got text messages. 
  I got e-mails. 
  I got an affair with his sidepiece dating way back before Rachel was killed. 
  (computer beeps) 
  Whoa. 
  Whoa. 
  I got a whole nother sidepiece that neither Sidepiece One nor wife Rachel knew anything about. 
  Dude had two mistresses? 
  Yeah. 
  Well, what do you know? 
  I could hate this guy more. 
  I can't wait to bust this jackass. 
  RILEY: Yeah. 
  If these are the kind of guys Murdoc kills for free, I kind of get it. 
  (sighs) 
  (choking) 
  This is a constrictor knot. 
  The more you struggle, the more you choke. 
  Now if you love your wife and your kid - (groans) 
  - MacGYVER: Shh. 
  You're gonna come with me. 
  Okay? 
  (panting) 
  Very good boy. 
  - Shh-shh-shh-shh, shh-shh-shh. 
  - (grunting) 
  (tires screech) 
  (choking) 
  What Omnus? 
  I don't even know what you're talking about. 
  Joshua, we talked about this. 
  - I don't like liars. 
  - I'm not lying. 
  - I don't know any Omnus. 
  - They know you, because they've hired someone to kill you! 
  You got to believe me, man. 
  I don't know anything. 
  If you don't know them, why do they call you the Architect? 
  What? 
  I have no idea. 
  I swear. 
  I work in I. T. , at a cellular company, okay? 
  Look, I don't know anything about an Omnus or any attack. 
  (choking) 
  Please. 
  My wife and I we got another baby coming. 
  Got another one coming. 
  Please! 
  You got to believe me. 
  You got to. 
  I do believe you. 
  And I'm not gonna hurt you. 
  (sighs) 
  But if you really don't know anything about Omnus, why are they paying $10 million to have you killed? 
  JACK: What do you mean he doesn't know anything? 
  He is the Architect, isn't he? 
  I mean, you didn't grab the wrong guy, did you? 
  No. 
  I didn't grab the wrong guy. 
  Joshua Abdal Khan. 
  Name, Social, address they all match the intel that they gave me. 
  This is the guy that they want dead. 
  Hey, you, Specs. 
  I need a full profile on this guy now. 
  Uh, doesn't Ms. 
  Davis normally handle that? 
  Do you want to find that profile, or you want to find a new job? 
  Uh, yes, ma'am. 
  MATTY: Come on, chop, chop. 
  Time is money. 
  Okay, born in San Jose. 
  Degrees from Stanford and Columbia. 
  Works in I. T. at TeleVast Communications. 
  Yeah, if it's a cover identity, it's a good one. 
  Oh, I don't think it's a cover. 
  I went full Murdoc on this guy, and No, no, you didn't go full Murdoc. 
  If you'd have done that, he'd be laying in a pool of his own blood right now. 
  I went as Murdoc as I'm willing to go. 
  Okay, Jack? 
  And it was far enough to scare me and far enough to break any civilian, so Trust me, I just he doesn't know anything about Omnus. 
  He has no idea why they call him the Architect. 
  Then why the hell do they want him dead? 
  Well, that's the $10 million question, now, isn't it? 
  (phone ringing) 
  Guys, stay on the line. 
  I'm getting a call. 
  THE CLIENT: You tampered with our phone, Murdoc. 
  We can't pinpoint your location. 
  What can I say? 
  I'm a big fan of the right to privacy. 
  THE CLIENT: And I'm a big fan of results. 
  Why didn't you neutralize the target at his home? 
  If you want someone gunned down in their front yard, you call the Mafia. 
  I'm an artist. 
  THE CLIENT: Then I sincerely hope you're standing over a Jackson Pollock of splattered blood on plastic sheet. 
 
 
 
  Come on, Mac. 
  Stall. 
  Oscar time, baby. 
  Let's go. 
  Actually, I've decided that the price of this particular masterpiece has just gone up. 
  THE CLIENT: You're trying to renegotiate? 
  You made a deal with the devil. 
  Did you really think it was gonna be fair? 
  Thought not. 
  If you're willing to pay $10 million, I'd wager you're willing to pay more. 
  Say, 15? 
  Fine. 
  $15 million. 
  If the job is completed in the next 30 minutes. 
  We'll wire the funds as soon as you send proof of death. 
  - (phone beeps) 
  - (exhales) 
  I don't understand. 
  You said you weren't gonna kill me, and then you renegotiated the price? 
  MacGYVER: I'm not gonna kill you. 
  I was just trying to buy time. 
  Look, they want proof of death. 
  Don't worry, I'm gonna fake it, while you try and figure out what you did - to piss these guys off so bad. 
  - I What-what do you do at work, exactly? 
  Um, for the last four months, I've been working on a way to filter static out of cellular lines. 
  Yeah, I don't see the connection. 
  You're just gonna have to tell me everything about it. 
  And when I say "everything," I mean everything. 
  Having two mistresses gives Brett motive up the wazoo. 
  But it's not the hard evidence we need to tie him to Rachel's murder. 
  Think she had any idea who she was really married to? 
  Maybe. 
  Maybe not. 
  People believe what they want to believe. 
  You say that like you know it from experience. 
  Not mine. 
  My mom's. 
  When I was 16, she dated this guy for a while Uh, just to be clear, this story isn't about Jack, right? 
  Because that's gonna make things real awkward. 
  No, this was right after Jack. 
  She was heartbroken, and she met this guy who said all the right things, but what he did was the exact opposite. 
  Guy was a con man. 
  Scumbag. 
  Took my mom for everything she had. 
  Damn, Riley. 
  - That sucks. 
  - Yeah, no big. 
  I got the money back. 
  Oh, snap. 
  So what, you, like, hacked his bank account? 
  No, I, uh I got a biker gang to have a talk with him. 
  And when you say "talk," you mean They broke his legs. 
  So he gave everything back, and then he ghosted. 
  And how does a 16-year-old get a biker gang to I may have hacked the LAPD and made a few dozen open warrants disappear. 
  And they hospitalized a guy as a way to say thanks. 
  Well, they're a biker gang. 
  It's not like they're gonna send a fruit basket. 
  (computer beeps) 
  Whoa. 
  Mistress number two works at a place that sells GPS locator tags. 
  Would be a huge break if this was the case of her missing keys. 
  (computer beeps) 
  Looks like she sold some to Brett. 
  Probably how they met. 
  And he let his subscription run out a month after Rachel's murder. 
  They make them for golf clubs. 
  14 clubs in a set. 
  How many did Brett buy? 
  (typing) 
  Fourteen. 
  Cause of death was blunt force trauma. 
  And police never found a murder weapon. 
  I'll see if I can reactivate his old account. 
  13 clubs at Brett's house. 
  And one in the middle of nowhere. 
  (dog barking in distance) 
  BOZER: Ugh. 
  Feel like I'm getting tetanus just breathing in here. 
  That's not how tetanus works. 
  (phone beeping steadily) 
  No. 
  (phone beeps) 
  It's in here. 
  Does that look like dried blood to you? 
  All right, Josh, what were you saying? 
  Then about four months ago, we started getting calls from customers complaining about static on the line, a lot of calls. 
  A-And for months, I was going nuts trying to figure out what was causing the interference. 
  Wait. 
  Wait, what is this for? 
  Oh, have you ever seen a corpse that wasn't pale? 
  Me, neither. 
  Keep talking. 
  Uh, so, anyway, I finally realized I couldn't locate the source of the interference because it wasn't interference. 
  It was data. 
  Some kind of high-frequency tone buried in the cell traffic. 
  You guys getting this? 
  JACK: Yeah. 
  Yeah, loud and clear, Mac. 
  But am I the only one who doesn't get how bad cell phone service leads to a death warrant? 
  No, you know what? 
  When I say it aloud, makes perfect sense. 
  No, it's not just bad cell service, Jack. 
  Somebody was hiding messages in the static. 
  LIL: Okay, I got us into Joshua's work files. 
  What are we looking for? 
  A file called "HFstatic. 
  exe," a diagnostic program I wrote two days ago. 
  I hadn't deployed it on our whole network yet, but it should pinpoint the origin of the signals. 
  Wait, two days ago? 
  That's when Omnus put out the kill order on you. 
  JACK: And now we know why. 
  Josh's program was about to blow the lid off Omnus and their secret communication system. 
  I'm beginning to think Omnus isn't as new as we thought they were. 
  The yellow dots are Joshua's hidden signals, and the red dots mark the location of every operative we suspect is working for The Organization. 
  MacGYVER: The Organization? 
  As in The Organization that hired Murdoc to kill us and turned Thornton? 
  JACK: Now, now, wait a minute. 
  That-that would make sense. 
  Josh did say that four months ago, customers started complaining about static on the line, right? 
  - Right. 
  - We nailed Thornton four months ago. 
  That's when The Organization found out their communication system was compromised. 
  So they came up with this instead. 
  MacGYVER: And it worked. 
  Until a network systems architect tried to fix it. 
  Hence the code name. 
  So Omnus is The Organization. 
  Y-You mean to tell me my boy's been out there cosplaying as Murdoc with The Organization? 
  Whoa, whoa. 
  The Organization is back? 
  Like, The Organization organization? 
  And Jack knows what cosplay is? 
  Yeah, it looks that way, Boze. 
  Once I send proof of Josh's death, he'll be safe, and we can make a plan to take The Organization down. 
  Hey, hold still. 
  And look dead. 
  (camera clicks) 
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mac, don't send that photo. 
  - (phone chimes) 
  - And if I already did? 
  Murdoc's scrambler blocks them from seeing your GPS signal. 
  But every photo you take stores your GPS coordinates as metadata. 
  You just sent The Organization your exact location. 
  - Maybe they won't look. 
  - Um, I'm pretty sure they looked. 
  Mac, I've got 12 signals converging on your location. 
  JACK: And something tells me they know you're not Murdoc. 
  MacGYVER: That's why they agreed to my price so fast. 
  They made me and got me to tell them where we were. 
  Yeah, well, now an Organization kill squad's coming to clean your room, homie. 
  You better get out of there right away. 
  JACK: On my way, pal, but you're gonna have to hold them off for a bit. 
  - Can you do that? 
  - I don't have a choice. 
  - See you when you get here. 
  - You better. 
  So, how many bullets you got for that thing? 
  Oh, that? 
  None. 
  I, uh it's just for show. 
  I'm not a big fan of guns. 
  But the people coming to kill us, they have guns, right? 
  Oh, yeah, tons. 
  That's why I'm not a big fan. 
  - I've been shot at a lot. 
  - So, what are we gonna do? 
  MacGYVER: Buy us some time until Jack and his team get here. 
  A cleaning cart. 
  Seriously? 
  Trust me. 
  (vehicles approaching) 
  (tires screeching) 
  They're here. 
  Get inside. 
  (guns clicking) 
  You built a fog machine? 
  That's a hell of a distraction. 
  Only if we live. 
  Come on. 
  Move in. 
  Let's go, go! 
  THE CLIENT: They're using the fog as cover. 
  Go to thermal, go to thermal. 
  OPERATIVE: Targets acquired. 
  Behind the umbrella. 
  - (automatic gunfire) 
  - JOSHUA: That didn't buy us much time. 
  No, but this will. 
  MacGYVER: Here, this way! 
  This way! 
  Go, go, go! 
  Keep running! 
  Don't stop! 
  - (automatic gunfire) 
  - OPERATIVE: Move in, move in! 
  - This way. 
  - Hurry up! 
  Move in! 
  OPERATIVE: We got them. 
  Target acquired. 
  JOSHUA: Oh, my God, we're surrounded. 
  OPERATIVE: Go! 
  (gunfire continues) 
  Hey, man. 
  Good to see you're still upright. 
  Unlike you. 
  Or you. 
  (gunshots) 
  Team Leader, where are you? 
  - What's your status? 
  - Bleeding. 
  (groans) 
  (agents chattering) 
  (sighs) 
  Yeah, there he is. 
  - Doing all right, brother? 
  - Yeah. 
  You sure? 
  Yeah, not a scratch. 
  No, no, I mean up here, in la cabeza. 
  Murdoc did a real number on that magic melon of yours, brought out a side of you I've never seen before. 
  Yeah. 
  I was just playing a part. 
  Seriously. 
  It's as easy to shed as this jacket. 
  I don't know, me? 
  I'm method. 
  When I go undercover, I become that person, whether it's Chad Palomino, Bryce Villanova or Hortense Ledbetter. 
  We've got to work on your names. 
  Well, Hortense is a cat person, likes daytime soap operas. 
  - But Bryce? 
  - (laughs) 
  Oh, man, Bryce loves the spotlight, man. 
  He loves the spotlight. 
  Well, you're just missing the point. 
  You're supposed to conceal your identity. 
  Sometimes. 
  Ed, Cindy. 
  - We're - Not who we were expecting. 
  Don't say a word. 
  We're leaving. 
  W-Wait, please. 
  I know you don't know us, but we're not killers and we're not the police. 
  The only person getting arrested today is the man who killed your daughter. 
  What are you talking about? 
  CINDY: Is, uh is this real? 
  Happening as we speak. 
  Police finally found the murder weapon. 
  - How? 
  - How doesn't matter. 
  All that matters is justice will finally be served. 
  (gasping) 
  Well, the Boy Scout's still alive. 
  I can only assume that means that you've now earned your contract killer merit badge. 
  Actually, I was able to complete the mission without any body bags, which I'm sure disappoints you. 
  Quite the contrary. 
  See, I'm for any outcome that keeps you alive long enough for me to get to kill you. 
  So, what is today's lesson, Mr. 
  MacGyver? 
  You want me to teach you how to pass yourself off as, uh, Charlie Manson? 
  No, I'm here to thank you, because without your advice, an innocent man and I would both be dead. 
  Yeah. 
  Nope. 
  I don't care. 
  I'm still a sociopath and your thanks mean nothing to me. 
  Yeah, but just saying it means something to me. 
  I guess that's the difference between you and I. 
  So you think you know me now? 
  Better than I'd care to admit. 
  (quiet crunching) 
  Mmm. 
  You know, being locked up works up a powerful appetite, but thankfully, Matilda gave me a few small perks in exchange for helping you. 
  You said you were deathly allergic to those. 
  Did I? 
  Hmm. 
  You know, MacGyver, people just believe what they want to believe. 
  Like right now, for instance. 
  You want to believe that this is over. 
  (door buzzes) 
  Your name is Daniel Horn. 
  You were born August 5, 1975, in Chandler, Arizona. 
  You attended Torrance Elementary and then Thomas Edison Middle School and high school. 
  You grew up with a dog named Piper, a little Pomeranian. 
  Both your parents passed. 
  You have a sister and a brother, but you haven't seen them in decades. 
  You have a B. A. in poli-sci and then you joined the Army after graduation. 
  Rose to cyber command sergeant before a dishonorable discharge in 2009 for selling DARPA computer codes to North Korea's Bureau 121 hacker unit. 
  After that, you fell off the grid, but we've matched your signature to a dozen cyber attacks all around the world; most recently, a water treatment plant in Chile on behalf of The Organization. 
  You see, I know everything there is to know about you, Daniel. 
  Hell, I even know the name you still murmur in your sleep. 
  But what you don't know, Matilda Webber, is that I wanted to be caught.
