 (heavy breathing) 
 MacGyver : I'll be honest with you, man. 
 Things don't look too good for you. 
 I mean, I'm a nice guy, but I just got this new boss, Matilda Webber... and she's merciless with terrorists like you. 
 You're nervous... and you should be... because in a few minutes you're gonna be alone in a room with her, and there's nothing I can do to help. 
 (shouts) 
 From where I'm standing, doesn't look like I need any help... 
 (shouting) 
 Okay. 
 You were saying? 
 Uh, I was just, uh... 
 Maybe you could teach me this move, too? 
 You work in the lab, Boze. 
 I don't think Director Webber's gonna be too concerned with your field skills. 
 Yeah, but you don't not know that she's not gonna not care. 
 Was that a quadruple negative? 
 I don't know. I lost count. 
 Look, I just want to be ready for anything. 
 Did I at least beat Riley's time? 
 It's not a competition. 
 We're going again. 
 Bozer. 
 Going again. Going again. 
 ♪ ♪

 So... are we cool? 
 We just stared each other down for three minutes straight, Jack. 
 What do you think? 
 I take it you're not gonna apologize, then? 
 Are you going to apologize? 
 It wasn't my plan. 
 Oh, you had a plan? 
 (laughs) 
 Of course. 
 Well, I guess there's a first for everything. 
 Oh, come on, is this the way it's gonna be between us? 
 Just cheap shots and staring contests? 
 No, Jack, because as much as I love a good staring contest, which I won, by the way... 
 No. 
 ... we're not nine and I signed on as director of Phoenix to get things done. 
 So, you and I are gonna sit here, like two rational adults, and work this out. 
 (mumbling): Being an adult... 
 Did you just do that... little kid mumble-under- your-breath thing? 
 No. 
 So... Jack's evaluation seems to be going well. 
 I can't believe we all have to do one of those. 
 Can't she just fire me based on my résumé? 
 Relax. 
 These two have some sort of... history. 
 He claims she's the reason he left the CIA. 
 Riley : Any idea what happened between them? 
 No, he won't tell me. 
 Which means whatever it is... it's got to be his fault. 
 MacGyver : It also means that unless Matty was your station chief for 18 months in South America, these evaluations are nothing to worry about. 
 Riley : Oh, really? 
 Is that why yours keeps getting postponed? 
 Postponed? 
 Riley : Oh, yeah. Twice. 
 First, a coffee machine mysteriously catches fire. 
 Then, a well-placed gum wrapper puts Phoenix's entire security system on lockdown. 
 I know, it's weird. I wonder how that got wedged in there. 
 Bozer : So maybe Riley and I aren't the only ones feeling a little nervous about these evaluations. 
 (sighs) 
 (phone chimes) 
 Can't stall forever, Mac. 
 Just got a text. 
 (phones chiming) 
 From Matty Webber. 
 MacGyver : "Get your asses in here." 
 Everything okay in here? 
 Yeah, super. 
 We were just reminiscing about old times, weren't we? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Riley, can you tell us about a program that you coded called "FR-1507"? 
 Uh, yeah, yeah. 
 It's a new facial-recognition program I'm working on. (clears throat) 
 Still in beta testing right now, but we're comparing random faces in YouTube videos to the FBI's Most Wanted list to train it to eliminate false positives. 
 Well, you may have been looking for false positives, but you found a real criminal. 
 Take a look at what just came in. 
 Jack : Bummer it had to interrupt our little chitchat. 
 Shut up, Jack. 
 Oh, snap, I saw this already. It's amazing. 
 Hey, watch right here when the bottle breaks over the dude's head. 
 And... bam! 
 (both laughing) 
 Wait, this ding dong stealing Ding Dong's on the FBI's Most Wanted? 
 Not him. 
 Him. 
 Oh. 
 This guy is a 17-point match for a fugitive named Douglas Bishop, number six on FBI's Most Wanted. 
 Bishop was a top lieutenant in the Philly mob until Special Agent Eva Santos was tasked with busting him. 
 MacGyver : According to this, Bishop gunned her down and escaped before he could stand trial. 
 Yeah, the FBI's gonna want this collar. 
 He killed one of their own. 
 Shouldn't we be sharing this intel with them? 
 I'd love to if we can trust them. 
 We can't trust the feds? 
 Not on when it comes to Bishop. 
 He's been on their radar for years, targeted in multiple investigations, and then somehow has slipped through the cracks every single time. 
 You think he's got an agent in his pocket, helping him escape? 
 I think that there's reason to suspect it, and until we know the truth, we can't trust anyone at the FBI. 
 We want Bishop to answer for killing a federal agent, we're just gonna have to catch him ourselves. 
 Mac, Jack, you'll find Bishop. 
 Riley, you'll run surveillance from Phoenix. 
 And Bozer... what exactly is it that you do here again? 
 I... work in the lab? 
 I know. I was messing with you. 
 (both chuckle) 
 I want you and Riley here so that we can do your evaluations. 
 Okay, people, this is our first op together as a team. 
 Time to show me what you've got. 
 (bell chimes) 
 Ilene Preskin? 
 All right, look, I'll tell you two guys what I told the other guys. 
 I am not looking for representation. 
 I do not want to do any television appearances, and I am not looking to sell my life rights. 
 MacGyver : Ma'am... who is it you think we are? 
 Come on, you Hollywood types been coming here, bugging me ever since my nephew posted that damn video. 
 You think we're, uh... 
 We are Hollywood types. She got us pegged. 
 You got a great eye. Yeah, especially this guy. 
 Totally. We are from Hollywood, and we're here about your video, but we're actually looking for this man. 
 We think he has that certain "it factor" that we need for our next project. 
 Do you know him? 
 Charlie? 
 Yeah, I know him. He comes in here all the time. 
 And does Charlie have a last name? 
 A stage name, perhaps? 
 Well, I don't know, I never asked, but it's not like you need an ID to buy Gooey-Pies. 
 He comes in here once a day. 
 He gets a box of them Gooey-Pies, and we just... chat. 
 Do you know where he lives? 
 No... but I should for as long as he's been flirting with me. 
 I mean, he's never asked me out, but, I mean, you don't not like a girl if you've made that many sketches for her. 
 Oh. May I? 
 Knock yourself out... but I'll tell you what, you use Charlie's name, and I will sue you. 
 Well, thanks, Ilene, you've been extremely helpful. 
 She has? 
 You have. 
 I think I'm gonna have my people call your people. Do lunch. 
 (door opens) 
 Ciao, mama. 
 (bell chimes) 
 Okay, all right. 
 I know I'm probably missing something again, but didn't she just say she didn't know Douglas' last name or where he lived? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Don't tell me you just turned a photo of a sketch of a bird into a fugitive finder? 
 Okay, I won't tell you, then. 
 Okay, smarty-pants. 
 Now you have to tell me, I insist. 
 See this sketch? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, it's a view out of a window, and I'm thinking it's Bishop's window. 
 Since we can identify two large buildings, we're just a little trigonometry away from finding out exactly where he lives. 
 Yeah, that's a little far-fetched. 
 Hey, I don't really look like a Hollywood type to you, do I? 
 Just from the eyes up, really. 
 Look at you.

 Oh! 
 I didn't know you were... 
 How long have you been standing there? 
 18 and a half minutes. 
 Okay. 
 Do you need to change your undies? 
 No, I'm good. 
 I think. 
 I wanted to remind you that your evaluation is tomorrow. 
 I didn't forget. 
 I'm sure you didn't. 
 Well, thanks for coming by. 
 It's always good to see you? 
 Oh, I'm not leaving. I came to watch you work. 
 Great. 
 Yeah, definitely Bishop's apartment. 
 Buddy, you could've at least waited to block our only exit until I made sure the guy who... likes to kill federal agents isn't home? 
 I'm just glad we broke into the right apartment. 
 Trig's a little rusty. 
 You're sure this is this guy's place? 
 Yeah, kettle's still warm. 
 He was just here. 
 Okay, so... what, did he hear us coming and take off, or what? 
 Yeah, or he's coming back. 
 I say we hole up across the street and wait for him. 
 (doorknob rattles) 
 Maybe he forgot something. 
 FBI, FBI! 
 Drop-drop it! 
 FBI, hands in the air! 
 You drop it! 
 Hands in the air! 
 Hands in the air! 
 (handcuffs tighten) 
 One's got a gun, the other has a Swiss Army knife. 
 No identification of any kind. 
 All right, fellas, who are you and what are youse doing here? 
 Okay, we are door-to-door Bible salesmen. 
 Do yourself a favor and don't get smart. 
 Okay, fella? 
 Okay. 
 Now tell us your names. 
 What are we being charged with? 
 You were caught in the apartment of a wanted felon. 
 Right, but what are we being charged with? 
 If we're being formally charged, we have a right to know. 
 Well, uh, what? All right. 
 Let's get in the car. 
 Asked you a question. 
 Just get in the car. 
 Okay. All right, I'm in. 
 (car door closes) 
 Well, so much for finding Bishop before the feds do. 
 I don't think these guys had to find him. 
 Did you hear their accents? 
 They're not from around here, that's a Philly accent. 
 Yeah. Bishop's old stomping grounds. 
 If either one of these guys are on Bishop's payroll, I don't think this trip ends at the FBI field office. 
 Nope. 
 We got to get out of here. 
 Think of something. 
 (sighs) 
 Oh, I got something. 
 And even I don't like it. 
 Jack : Do it. 
 (grunts) 
 (grunts) 
 (chuckling): Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Hey! Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? 
 (grunts) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, points for originality, but this only counts as an escape if we don't die. 
 MacGyver : Yeah, this is the "even I don't like it" part. 
 (lock clicks) 
 (chuckles) 
 Jack : Let's go, man. 
 Come on, man. 
 (horn honking) 
 (tires screeching) 
 (laughs) 
 We got ignition. 
 (engine starts) 
 (tires screeching) 
 (groans) 
 (horns blaring) 
 (groans) 
 Yeah! 
 (whoops) 
 (laughing): Yeah! That was awesome! 
 Now, let's never do it again. 
 Just a reminder. 
 Don't tell the Hun about our little run-in with the feds, all right? 
 Yep. I was thinking the same thing. 
 (laughs) 
 And you thought you didn't need to tell me about stealing a car from two FBI agents because you were hoping I wouldn't find out? 
 Jack : Sorry, Matty, but I have no idea what you're talking about right now. 
 We're up on all FBI communications, Jack. 
 And I'm looking at a field report from two agents whose Sedan was just boosted by two male suspects found in Bishop's apartment. 
 Well, that could be anybody. 
 Really? 
 Okay, yes, we should have told you. 
 But it's not the headline here. 
 We were in Bishop's apartment two minutes before the feds showed up, and they were from Philly. 
 We're already looking at every fed in the Philly office. 
 This now moves your new pals, Brooks and Cho, to the top of the suspect list. 
 But I needed you two to find Bishop before the feds. 
 And from what Riley tells me, you may have missed your chance. 
 The FBI's watching all mass transit. 
 They just found a car registered under Bishop's alias. 
 Parked in front of a train station. 
 Great, now we definitely know he's not on a train. 
 And we know that how? 
 Because Bishop's been on the run for eight years. 
 He's too smart to make a rookie mistake like that. 
 Okay, baby Einstein. 
 You know where he's not. 
 Got anything to tell us where he is? 
 Yeah, actually, I might. 
 Riley, check all Atlanta bus schedules. 
 See if there's a Bus 23. 
 Parked at 5:00 p.m. 
 Yep. Bus 23 departs from Forsyth Station at 5:00 p.m. today. 
 How'd you know that? 
 I read the paper. 
 Yeah, okay, Matty, we'd love to stay and chitchat, but it looks like we have a bus to catch. 
 Bye-bye. 
 (phone beeps) 
 Ma'am, you have an incoming call from Martin Dryer on the secure line. 
 Should I know a Martin Dryer? 
 Regional director of the FBI. 
 Oh, fancy. 
 I'll take it in here, thanks. (intercom chimes) 
 Director Dryer, Matilda Webber, what can I do for you? 
 Ms. Webber, please forgive the bluntness of my question, but I am on a clock. 
 Do you have any agents in the field in Atlanta? 
 Well, I'm not sure what agency you think I work for, but I'm... 
 Actually, Ms. Webber, I have no idea where you landed. 
 What I do know is that you transferred out of a high-level position with Homeland Security and you didn't show up anywhere else. 
 And since the CIA, the NSA and the DEA won't claim the two operatives that just stole an FBI vehicle in Atlanta, I figured maybe they were working for you. 
 I can neither confirm nor deny. 
 Don't want to share any intel with me, that's fine, I get it. 
 But I'm gonna share some with you. 
 Did you get the InterAgency Memo about one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted showing up in a viral video? 
 Douglas Bishop? 
 It might have crossed my desk. 
 Well, I believe that Bishop has eluded capture for so long because he has one of our agents on his payroll. 
 Huh. Interesting theory. 
 I wish it were just a theory. 
 It's just come to my attention that two of the agents from our Philly office are down in Atlanta looking for Bishop. 
 Without authorization, a thousand miles outside their jurisdiction. 
 And you think one or both of them might be dirty? 
 I do, but without knowing all the players in the game, I can't be completely sure, so I'm gonna ask you again. 
 Come on, Martin. 
 Don't make me do the "confirm or deny" thing twice in one phone call. 
 Okay, look, cards on the table. 
 I don't know who I can trust at the Bureau right now, but I do know your reputation, so if there's anything you can do to help... 
 I would do it in a heartbeat. 
 And if and when that opportunity should arise, you will be the first to know. 
 In the meantime, good luck with your missing car. 
 (call ends) 
 The moment we have Bishop, call me. 
 (indistinct announcement over P.A.) 
 So how long you think you can keep not telling me? 
 Not telling you what? 
 MacGyver : You know what I'm talking about. 
 What happened between you and Matty? 
 I don't know, how long's forever? 
 (chuckles) Come on, man. 
 You come on, man. 
 Hey, look, we're not just partners, we're family, so any problem you have is a problem of mine. 
 Okay. 
 Besides, if it were me who had the dark history between our new boss, you'd be like, (imitating Jack): "Hey, listen, man. You got to..." 
 Yeah, yeah, do that Yosemite Sam, I'm-a punch you right in the mouth. Go on. 
 Look, all I'm saying is you're gonna tell me eventually, you might as well spill it now. 
 No. 
 Is she really the reason you left the CIA? 
 Jack : Oh. 
 Right when I was about to tell you. 
 There's our boy. 
 Yeah, but this isn't over yet. 
 Hey, stop! Stop! 
 Hey, move! 
 Move! 
 Hey. 
 (screams) 
 Move, move, move! Stop! 
 Move! 
 Stop! 
 Stop, man, stop! 
 (grunts) 
 Bishop? Bishop? 
 Hey, hey, hey! Relax. 
 No more running. You understand me? 
 Huh? 
 Who are you? 
 I can tell you who we're not: we're not your buddies at the FBI. 
 No, don't turn me over to the FBI. 
 Please. 
 You can drop the act, we know you have an FBI agent on your payroll. 
 What? 
 No! 
 I never had a fed in my pocket. 
 It was the other way around. 
 You better explain that statement. 
 For years, an FBI agent has been forcing me to do his dirty work for him. 
 If he finds me, he'll kill me. 
 So, a dirty FBI agent is trying to kill you? 
 Who is it? 
 Give us a name. 
 If I knew his name, you think I'd still be running? 
 I never met the guy. 
 For years, it's just been a voice on the phone, threatening to kill me if I didn't do what he said. 
 Do what he said, huh? Like what? 
 Bishop : Whatever he told me to do. 
 Ratting people out, planting evidence. 
 Murdering a federal agent? 
 Eva? I didn't kill her! 
 I was trying to confess to her. 
 I was gonna turn myself in. 
 I-I couldn't take working for this guy anymore. 
 And I needed a fed who I knew I could trust. 
 Eva had a spotless record a-and... there's no way that she could be the guy on the other end of the phone, right? 
 So, I-I told her that I wanted out, I wanted to testify, I-I wanted to help take down this b*st*rd been runnin' me. 
 She offered protective custody. 
 But the night we met up for her to take me in, someone shot her. 
 That's not what the evidence says. 
 Who's collecting this evidence? 
 The FBI. 
 This dirty agent killed Santos to cover his tracks. 
 They tried to pin it on me. 
 And if he was willing to kill her, I knew I'd be next. So I ran. 
 Riley, did you catch all that? 
 Yep. 
 But, uh, hey, remember those two feds you guys ran into? 
 Brooks and Cho? How could I forget? 
 They ever find their car? 
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure they did, because after you all became besties, I took the liberty of illegally tracking their phones. 
 Looks like they just pulled up at the depot. 
 Oh. I don't know if I'm ready to believe his story, but I'm sure as hell not ready to hand him over to these guys. 
 Agreed, let's get anywhere that ain't here, so we can hole up, figure this out. 
 
 
 
 Uh, Director Webber, I didn't hear you come in. 
 Because I didn't want you to. 
 And please call me Matty. 
 Director Webber was my father. 
 That was a joke. 
 So, I shouldn't call you Matty? 
 Call me Matty. 
 My father sold shoes for a living. 
 Which was the joke. 
 (softly): Oh. 
 Never mind. 
 Have a seat. It's time for your evaluation. 
 Well, MacGyver and Jack just caught Bishop and they said that... 
 He was framed by a dirty fed for murder. 
 Yeah. I'm on comms, too. 
 Then is now the best time for an evaluation? 
 Sit. 
 So you were in federal prison, two years into a five-year sentence, and then a traitor pulls some strings and you get early release. 
 Well, actually, it was Jack's idea to get me out, so... 
 Is that supposed to make me feel better? 
 Um... yes? 
 So you hacked the NSA not once, but twice. 
 Your latest time while working here at Phoenix. 
 What's not in your file, is that a year before your first NSA hack, you hacked the Pentagon. 
 I don't, I don't know what you're... 
 Yes, yes, you do, Riley. 
 Or should I call you Artemis37? 
 You used a different handle and you went to some extreme lengths to anonymize yourself. 
 But I know it was you. 
 I also know that you snooped around a little bit and you didn't steal any files. 
 But what I don't know is why. 
 Look... 
 I'll admit I've made some really bad decisions. 
 But since I joined Phoenix, for the first time, I've had the opportunity to do the right thing, to be one of the good guys. 
 This job is a second chance for me. 
 Please don't take that away. 
 A nice speech. 
 And I believe sincere. 
 But that still doesn't answer my question: why? 
 May I hazard a guess, Riley? 
 I think you hacked the Pentagon just to see if you could. 
 See, that mind of yours is like a loaded gun. 
 And a gun just wants to fire. 
 It doesn't particularly care who or what it shoots at. 
 Which is where I come in. 
 You've fallen into my hands, and it's on me to aim you at the right targets. 
 So I'm keeping you on the team... on a provisional basis. 
 Now, if that sounds good to you, how about you help me figure out if Bishop is lying to us? 
 (quietly): Yeah. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (electrical zap, fan rattling) 
 Hey. 
 Anything from Phoenix? 
 Not a peep. 
 They're still combing through old FBI case files, trying to make sure his story checks out. 
 Yeah, okay, good. 
 So I parked the rental car about ten blocks to the south, searched the perimeter. 
 The good news is, our pals Brooks and Cho have no earthly idea where we are. 
 What's the bad news? 
 Oh, the diner across the street's closed. 
 So dinner's coming out of the hotel vending machine. 
 There you go, bon appétit. 
 Where do Gooey-Pies and diet soda fall on the food pyramid? 
 Oh, I don't know, I just tried to represent every food group. 
 Here you go, America's Most Wanted, have a Gooey-Pie. 
 No, thanks. I hate these things. 
 MacGyver : What? 
 Then why'd you buy them every day? 
 Jack : 'Cause he didn't go there for the Gooey-Pies, he went there for Ilene, didn't you? 
 When I first got into town, I'd been on the run for about three months. 
 I happened to walk in this little convenience store and there she was. 
 Ilene. 
 She smiled at me. 
 That was it. 
 First time anyone showed me any kindness in I don't know how long. 
 I just stood there smiling back at her like a dumbass. 
 She asked me what I wanted. 
 I-I couldn't speak, I couldn't even think. 
 And I just pointed at the Gooey-Pies. 
 Well, that explains the first box. 
 Well, next time I went in, she smiled at me again and I pointed at the Gooey-Pies. 
 Guess I was afraid that if I explained to her that I didn't actually like Gooey-Pies, I might end up telling her my whole life story. 
 Sounds crazy, right? 
 Being on the run can do weird things to your mind. 
 So you guys, uh, are really not FBI? 
 Come on, baby, do we look like FBI? 
 (soft chuckle) 
 Just know that with us you're safe. 
 So I might actually get the chance to testify and go to prison? 
 You want to go to prison? 
 I know being locked up is no picnic, but what I've been through the past eight years is no kind of life. 
 You can't get close to anyone. 
 You can't even trust anyone. I mean, I... 
 I met the love of my life six years ago, and I can't even risk asking her out to dinner. 
 Believe it or not, we can relate. 
 A few minutes with the right one is better than a lifetime with the wrong one. 
 What's her name? 
 Mm. Sarah. 
 (soft chuckle) 
 Well, here's to Sarah. 
 And Ilene. 
 And to a few minutes with the right one. 
 There you go. All right. 
 (phone rings) 
 (quietly): Oh. 
 Yes, ma'am? 
 So this is interesting. 
 We're going through the FBI's evidence in the Eva Santos murder case. 
 "Interesting" as in he's been telling the truth or "interesting" as in he's been lying through his teeth? 
 Well, that's the interesting part. 
 The FBI's key evidence is a security video of the murder. 
 I'm sending it to you now. 
 (phone chimes) 
 Jack : Well, this doesn't look good for Bishop. 
 Riley : Well, that's what we thought, too, at first. 
 This video was recorded using a 15-year-old CCD surveillance camera onto magnetic tape. 
 Hence all the static. 
 Riley : Hence almost all the static. 
 I ran statistical analysis on the video. 
 Most of the static is just random noise, actual degradation. 
 But the burst that happens when Santos was shot contains repeating pattern. 
 Meaning it was computer-generated? 
 Matty : Meaning that this video has been tampered with. 
 Someone added the static in the moment Santos was shot. 
 So, if Bishop was telling the truth, the person who tampered with the video and the person who shot her are the same. 
 Our dirty fed? 
 Jack : We-We need to see what really happened. 
 Riley, can you twist the vertical knob thingy... 
 Okay, one, no one knows what you're talking about. 
 Two, if you mean clean it up, the answer is yes. 
 I used the static's repeating pattern to back-engineer the algorithm that rendered it... 
 Hey, yeah, nobody knows what you're talking about, just do it. 
 Whatever. 
 This is what the video looks like with the fake static removed. 
 Well, have yourself another Gooey-Pie, Bishop. 
 Your story checks out. 
 He didn't shoot Santos. 
 And someone at the FBI made it look like he did. 
 Our dirty fed is real. 
 (fan rattling) 
 Riley : Uh, guys? 
 We just intercepted an FBI bulletin that went to the Atlanta PD 15 minutes ago. 
 It gives your exact location and warns that all three of you are armed and dangerous. 
 Which would explain why the SWAT team's outside loaded for bear. 
 Go, go. 
 (fan rattling on and off) 
 Jack : Well, whoever this dirty fed is, he isn't stupid. 
 Sending the locals to grab us so he can stay anonymous? That's a smart move. 
 Can we marvel at his intelligence after we escape? 
 Bishop : Sounds like we're all on the same page. 
 How do we get out of here? 
 (fan rattles) 
 Swat Officer : All clear! Move out! 
 Jack, give me your room key. 
 Is there a Bible in there? 
 (fan rattling) 
 Yeah. 
 Swat Officer : All right, next, next door! 
 Jack : What are you doing? 
 I'm making a bump key to get into the adjoining room. 
 If I can file it down enough, I can jam it in the key hole and bump the lock open. 
 Swat Officer : Go, go, move, move! 
 (fan continues rattling) 
 (whispering): Let's go, let's go. 
 (shower running, man whistling) 
 (shower stops, officer shouts) 
 (whistling continues) 
 Move. 
 Bathroom's clear. 
 Room's clear. 
 I've got nothing. 
 Let's move, let's go! 
 Where are you now? 
 Jack : We are on 75 South. 
 We couldn't make it back to our rental car, so we, uh... we kind of stole another one. 
 You stole another vehicle? 
 Jack : Yeah. 
 At least this one doesn't belong to the federal government. 
 Yeah, it should be noted here, Matty, that we're telling you the truth this time. 
 The truth. I'm honored. What do you want, a cookie? 
 Jack : Cookies are good, man, I like 'em. 
 Not the way I'm gonna feed 'em to you, you won't. 
 Well, while you two have been busy racking up felonies, I think we identified our dirty fed. 
 Riley traced the FBI bulletin that sent the SWAT team after you guys. 
 Whoever issued the order tried to anonymize themselves, but I was able to match the device that sent the order to the IMEI number of a cell phone we're already monitoring. 
 MacGyver : Agent Brooks. Why am I not surprised? 
 Matty : Our agents took him into custody ten minutes ago, but we're still checking to see if his partner, Cho, or any other feds are involved. 
 So it's safe to bring in Bishop now? 
 I'm making arrangements now for you to hand him off to an FBI agent I trust. 
 We'll send you location details as soon as we have them. 
 This isn't the lab. I thought this was the lab... 
 What are you doing here? 
 I work here? 
 Remember? 
 Yes, Bozer. 
 I mean what are you doing here in the war room, again? 
 Your evaluation isn't until this afternoon. 
 I know, and I know it's probably gonna go badly, and I probably won't have a job here afterwards, but I had to come talk to you. 
 'Cause this thing happened at my old job where an assistant manager, he was forging time cards. 
 But the dude still got a promotion because he covered his tracks so well, everybody... 
 Okay, Bozer, I would love for this story to contain 100% less burger-related info and some hint of a point. 
 I was looking through Agent Brooks' file... the guy you say is guilty... and, well, you got it wrong. 
 I got it wrong? 
 Respectfully... yes. 
 According to his FBI file, Brooks is in his 40s, with 20 years of experience at the Bureau. 
 Okay, you're not telling me anything that I don't already know. 
 My point is, Brooks is still running around on street detail. 
 If he had been dirty all this time, using Bishop to plant evidence and frame people, don't you think he'd be higher up the ladder by now? 
 Look, I know I don't have much experience when it comes to this kind of work... 
 You have no experience when it comes to this kind of work. 
 Yeah. But I've had tons of bosses. 
 And Brooks? 
 He's no boss. 
 (tires screeching) 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah? 
 Matty : Did you make the handoff yet? 
 No, we're doing it right now. 
 Is the agent you're with a six-foot-one black guy? 
 No. Why? 
 Then whoever you're meeting with isn't who I sent to bring in Bishop. 
 Take good care of him. 
 Will do. 
 That voice... 
 Jack, get Bishop away from him, now! 
 Don't let him get Bishop! 
 If I were you, cowboy, I'd back away slowly, or someone's gonna get hurt. 
 You! I want every Phoenix agent in MacGyver's vicinity headed for his location now. 
 You, get the deputy director of the FBI on the phone. 
 You, contact the Atlanta chief of police. 
 Right. I want every black and white backing up our people. 
 Ma'am, I have the deputy director of the... 
 Lou, it's Matty. You know that fugitive you guys are looking for, Douglas Bishop? 
 Yeah, well, we found him, and one of your agents is about to murder him. 
 Dryer, put the gun down and let's talk. 
 I don't see you walking away from this. 
 Sure I will. 
 Like you said, I'm the one with the gun. 
 I was trying to keep this all nice and neat. 
 I was hoping to end all this by taking Bishop for a little walk in the woods and then quietly retiring, no one the wiser... 
 Yeah, yeah, life's full of disappointments. 
 Drop the gun. 
 You can't shoot us all, I can promise you that. 
 I don't have to shoot everybody, just Bishop. 
 Because I don't care if he dies, but you do. 
 So you're gonna stay where you are... 
 No, I'm not. 
 Uh, uh... And we're gonna back up, get in my car, and drive away. 
 MacGyver : Then what? 
 Killing him won't end this. 
 We know you're dirty. Our boss has proof. 
 What, you don't think I have an exit strategy? 
 Dryer : I've been socking away cash for years. 
 And I've become an expert at making people disappear. 
 So when I'm gone, you'll never find me. 
 Jack : Think this through. 
 Being on the run sucks. Just ask Bishop. 
 He's been looking over his shoulder ever since he left Philly. 
 Now, pretty please, don't move, or I'll kill you. 
 Yeah, sorry, it was all I could think of. 
 As long as he's in handcuffs, I'm good. 
 Jack : Hey. 
 Cho : Hey. 
 Sorry we stole your car, man. 
 No worries. We found it. 
 Oh, good. 
 And sorry we got you busted. 
 You know, it was an accident. 
 It was an honest mistake. And besides, we're even now. 
 This jackass has been torpedoing my career for over a decade. 
 I'm gonna get a big promotion out of this bust. 
 Ooh, sounds like a win-win for everybody. 
 Except for you. You're a loser. 
 Let's take a little walk. 
 Okay. Bye-bye. 
 Thanks for the phone call. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, I don't like to eavesdrop, but I could tell that wasn't a lawyer. 
 I called the convenience store. 
 I told Ilene everything. 
 We got a date next week. 
 You do know that you're going to prison, right? 
 I mean, after everything you've done... 
 No, I, I know. 
 She's gonna come and visit me in lockup on Thursday. 
 She's gonna bring me cookies. 
 Okay... I get that my view is gonna include bars for quite a while, but honestly... for the first time in years, I feel free. 
 And that's all thanks to you, MacGyver. 
 Hey, have you seen Bozer?I  texted him on my way in. 
 Wishing him luck with his evaluation, but he didn't get back to me. 
 He's in there already, isn't he? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 If it goes anything like mine did, he's gonna come out seriously rattled. 
 (both laughing) 
 But, really, you had the guts to question me when most people wouldn't have. 
 When you knew you were right and I was wrong. 
 And because of that, a dirty fed is behind bars, and the witness that can keep him there is still alive. 
 Oh, you guys did all the hard stuff. 
 You might not know a lot about tradecraft, but that I can teach. 
 What I can't teach is speaking truth to power. 
 And that is the most valuable skill that an agent can have. 
 You're making me blush. 
 Later, Boze. 
 Bozer. 
 She likes Bozer? 
 Aw, come on. 
 Everybody likes Bozer. 
 Yes, that includes me. 
 Maybe she's not as hard to get along with as you say she is, Jack. 
 Yeah, what happened between you two? 
 She strand you on a mission somewhere? 
 No. 
 Disavow you to a foreign government? 
 Force you to cut your hair to conform to military code? 
 No, the... this wasn't about a stupid haircut, okay. 
 What happened between me and the Hun is personal. 
 We were, actually, really close friends up until this undercover op in Chechnya. 
 Mm, Chechnya. 
 Okay, and then what? 
 Don't stop now, I need to know this. 
 All right, well, everything was cool when we got there... 
 MacGyver, you're up. 
 Yeah, yes, ma'am. 
 Looks like story time's over, Grasshopper. 
 Good luck. 
 We'll get back to this. 
 Yeah. Godspeed. 
 First off, I want you to know that I respect you, your reputation, and your performance history. 
 Thank you. 
 I respect you and your... 
 That said, I want you to know that while your constant improvising is... impressive, I am not a big fan of "make it up as you go along" 
 Say what you will about Jack Dalton... and I've said a lot... but the man is a hell of an agent. 
 I know how he thinks, so I know how to use him. 
 You, on the other hand, I'm not so sure about. 
 Did you want me to respond? 
 Thornton ran a loose ship, maybe because she liked you and she wanted to watch your back. 
 Or maybe because she was a double agent and she didn't really care if you died. 
 Either way, from now on, things will be different. 
 I hope you don't think that I'm confused as to who runs the Phoenix, ma'am. 
 "Matty" 
 Why is it so hard to get you people to call me Matty? 
 Did Thornton have some weird thing about her first name? 
 Uh, rhetorical question. 
 Look, they say that it's better to be lucky than it is to be good. 
 But in my experience, anyone who has ever said that has wound up dead. 
 So far, I think you've been really lucky. 
 I don't want to be watching on a monitor the day your luck runs out. 
 Respectfully, ma'am... Matty, it's... not luck. 
 Then prove it. 
 You disagree with me? Good. 
 I can respect that. 
 This isn't a business where you can doubt yourself, not even for an instant. 
 But I need you to either play by my rules, or prove me wrong. 
 Show me that your way works and won't get you killed, I'll back off. 
 But mess up even one time, and the word "improvise" falls out of your vocabulary. 
 So what do you say? 
 You up for the challenge? 
 Matty... 
 I look forward to it.
