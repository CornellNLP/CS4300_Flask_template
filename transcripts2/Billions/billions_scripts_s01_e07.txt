 Previously on "Billions"... 
 Bobby : Donnie Caan. We're gonna triple up his stack. Get started with 200,000 shares of Rubinex. Dean, seventh President. Hint? Two after Monroe. Jackson. Andrew Jackson. Gordie, where was he from? Border areas near the Carolinas. All I have to do is drop the hammer, and you will look like absolute sh1t. I need you to find Martina Slovis. Dropped out of Brooklyn Law. Only for me. Raul Gomez. New York City Police Pension Fund. I wanna thank you for meeting with me in person. I knew that if I gave you my money, you would do whatever you had to and wouldn't care what it looked like. Bobby : This company came under attack. We're gonna put him in a cell. We will mobilize the war machine! f*ck, yeah! [cheering] I have never seen him like this. You think I'm overreacting? Tell me more about what he's doing. He's looking for a win. Orrin : The defendant agrees to an aggregate financial penalty of 1.9 billion dollars. Didn't he say that he would  never  settle? Bryan : That's what he's been saying. How did it happen? Wags : We can make that $1.9 back in, what, eight months? Six. You'll never trade securities again, not even for yourself. [check rips, rustles] I can't live in the middle. You won't. I've decided, for the good of our marriage, I've recused myself. You can count on me to finish what you started. I'm all in. I'm still gonna need you to keep me informed. Then you're not really recused. I am. Officially. [The Replacements' "The Ledge" playing] ♪ All eyes look up to me ♪

I saw them with Bruce Layner,  and it seemed like he was drinking. He  was  drinking. But I couldn't get to them in time. [whooshing sound] Thank you, Lilly. No, I definitely needed that info. And I appreciate that you called. [touchscreen clicks] Hey, guys, before you get in, I need to ask you something. Was Mr. Layner acting weird? A little. He kept saying things about money. He tried to make us feel bad. And what else? Did he, like... Was he drinking in the car? Answer your mother. He had a beer can in the car. I could smell it from the backseat. Why didn't you say something? Why did you let him drive you? He's an adult. Are you sure he was drinking alcohol while he was driving you? Lilly said it was more than one. Yeah, Dad. He was. Bobby!

[clears throat] [door opens] Just so you know, I don't go for the price of an espresso... [door closes] or even a few espressi or for any price. You blew up the settlement conference. You recused yourself. So we have to come to a new understanding about my role. And it's gotta be a bigger one. A lead role. My stink is gonna be all over this now. As you point out, uh, I, myself, am recused from the case. On the outside. So how could I possibly be bound by... Oh, come on. We both know your recusal is for show. Don't make me dig out the old CB radio and call in a convoy of reporters and investigators to examine it. Oh, maybe we interview your wife or... Okay. You win. Again. Uh, we did make a deal. And even though I was under duress at the time, I will stick to it. So you'll come in one afternoon this week when we're open for business. I will make sure that Connerty has his entire team assembled, and they will run you through all of it. Work hand in hand with you and the SEC. No. Not hand in hand. I'm gonna run point on this, and I need to hear you say that you're comfortable with that. I wanna be the f*cking commandant. ♪ tense music ♪ [scoffs] I'll pass word to my people.

Dale : Not that they should. It's just human nature. Look, Axelrod, you know, sweeps his phones, hires security to defend himself. So believe me, on some level, this is what he expects, what he knows he deserves. [taps table] Not from me. Dale : So feel a little bad then, but don't change what you're doing, like me with double cheeseburgers. No, but, Dale,  you  need to stop. He needs to keep going. We need him to do a deal with you directly. And when he does, we need you to confirm the source of the information, that it's insider. Well, that's gonna be hard to get him to do. That's why you're getting such a cherry f*cking deal for making it happen. Huh? Terri : Okay, let's get him wired up. [wind blowing] [dog barking in distance] Donnie : Sorry to bother, but I wanted to check in on the Kemlot trade. And you canceled the Sunday night call, so... It turned into a bit of a weekend. Okay. Uh, I want to know if you think I should be ready to pull the trigger at the open tomorrow. Wait. But you said... I'm not certain. [crickets chirping in distance] Okay, then. Thanks. Uh, is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah, like I said, it was a bit of a weekend. Why don't you come in for a drink? [laughs] It... [laughs] It's more than understandable. Given the circumstance, it was inevitable. The son of a bitch deserved it. But I earned my living by staving off the inevitable. Let the other dogs drool when the bell rings. I wait for the actual food to turn up. That way I get fed while the rest howl in the wind. We don't get to choose how and when we react. That's what the experiment proves. You've actually read Pavlov's study, haven't you? Yeah. I was a psych/philosophy major. Minor in economic theory, which, at Yale, is like another philosophy class. Broadness of thinking. That's the sh1t that sets you apart, Donnie. It's this sh1t that used to distract me while the other guys were racking up cartel-sized bonuses. No more. Look, no matter how civilized we get, at base, we are animals. Oh, yeah. I know. I know. I just wish I had... I... [sniffs] You, Donnie, you'd have shown restraint. For the sake of your kids. Me? My kids are gonna grow up thinking that's the way you're supposed to act. They didn't see it! They'll hear about it. They'll be embarrassed. Or worse, proud. Bullshit. They should damn well be proud. Their father stood tall for them. It did feel pretty good. [chuckles] If I could be that for my kids... You are... and you will continue to be. ♪ pensive music ♪ [indistinct conversations, telephone ringing] Bryan, muffled voice : All right, okay. So let's go over what we've got so far. The CI is close to Axelrod. He has been leveraged and he's highly motivated to save his own ass. Get Connerty in here this afternoon. Tell him to bring the team working the Construction Bid Rigging RICO cases. I need an update. Orrin : If word of this gets out, and it will, it's a major key problem. Your business faces an existential threat if it's handled the wrong way. The professional damage, if you are convicted of even simple misdemeanor assault... The prick drove our kids drunk. He's the one who should be prosecuted. He can't really press charges 'cause Bobby popped him. He will. He has to. It'll make his civil case that much stronger. So we gotta control the narrative. I'm already getting texts from gossip writers who've heard rumors. It's only a matter of time before Layner's team p... And no doubt, he has a team in place by now. Before they pick where they wanna dump the story for maximum impact. So we get our version out first. You need your friend Lilly to speak up. Say that she saw Layner drinking, tried to stop him from taking the kids in the car. She won't. Lara : She will. I'll get to her today. I asked Chief Mueller to join us so can break down how things will go at his former command... Southampton PD. Mr. Axelrod, I received some Intel just as I was arriving here today. The police out East may have come into possession of a video of the incident taking on someone's phone, which purports to show you striking Mr. Layner. That should cut our way. I'm not so sure. How bad is it? Well, I haven't seen it yet, but I've been told it's damning enough that they're planning on arresting you as early as tomorrow. But when Mr. Bach reached out to me, I reached out. And fortunately, even though I left the department seven years ago, that I'm still remembered fondly back there. That's good for all of us. It would be a big help if you could get confirmation of Layner's drinking. With that, the air goes out of the balloon on prosecuting you. Without it, you'll likely be indicted and tried. I'm arranging a back door arrival at the station house for the two of us and Mr. Bach. Chase : Well, most people would kill to have your career. Depending on what you want, I can get on the phone and bring you a dozen offers by 5 p.m. Can we... [inhales deeply] Let's slow this down. I need to be discreet. Understood. This is just a reconnaissance mission. I'm not committing here. Right. You're not sure what you want, which is a new feeling for someone like you. That won't work on me. I know all the tricks. I'm sure you do. Plus, you're brilliant. Billie always told me that you were the smartest of all of her friends. She said nice things about you, too, Chase. [laughs] I'm not sure I want the specifics behind that look. Good. That's all you're getting. [laughs] All right, well, then let's talk about you. What can I do for you to help you figure this out? No hedge funds. Nothing in finance. I can't work for a competitor. That would feel wrong. Well, that limits us. What's more important to you, the comp or the work itself? Do I have to choose? I have both now. It's rare. Both is hard. How hard? If you want to leave the hedgie world, nearly impossible. I don't know if I want to. It's what's best for my family. Well, corporate HR jobs with huge comp won't be hands-on with clients. And the rewarding work, like the stuff you're doing now, digging deep with folks who need to change quickly, that really only happens in the nonprofit sector. You'll be living on love instead of money. So you've got nothing for me. Nothing without a compromise. I wanna shoot straight with you from the beginning, which is not usually how I work. Did you just say that out loud? [chuckles] For some reason, I don't wanna bullshit you into giving me a retainer. I wonder why that is. You all have 'em. So-called friends at other funds who tell you that we're dinosaurs, oblivious to our own extinction. Are you gonna tell us they're not our  real  friends, Mom? [laughter] I'm gonna tell you that they're assholes... and wrong. Donnie : While it's true we have less outside money, the trade-off is freedom. woman and man : Yes. This is our time. Those of you in this room will be telling the story years from now about how we got up off the canvas and knocked the rest of 'em out. women : Yeah! [applause] Donnie : In fact, we won't even have to tell them, because they will all be in here begging for jobs. all : Yeah! Mafee : To that end, you know... man : You know it. ...knocking folks out, a couple of us got you something, Axe. I mean, you earned it. We just picked it up. [laughs] [applause] man : Whoo! woman : All right. Mafee : There it is. [cheers and applause] We heard you knocked that fucker on his ass.

[indistinct conversations] [purse thuds] [lock turns] Well, you're certainly winning friends and influencing people these days. Oh, what do you want me to say? I shouldn't have thrown that punch. You've done a lot of rash things you shouldn't have done lately. Oh. Oh, you're talking about that little sit-down with your husband? I am. [touchscreen clicking] You know, there's a psychological profile for people who self-sabotage, and... you're starting to fit it. [exhales] The term, when it comes to that settlement meeting, is self-defense, not self-sabotage. I might've been wrong at the barbecue, but sometimes I gotta hit back. The way I heard it... Don't worry about it. You just did what you thought was right, and I appreciate that. But just think about who had what to lose. I know that I went into that room ready to make a deal. ♪ tense music ♪ [footsteps depart] Lara : It just bugs me, you know? That Bobby clocked the guy? No, that the kids didn't pick up that Layner was drunk, that they didn't call me. They had a phone? Yeah. They always do. They call me to tell me that their Instagram isn't loading. They're just not street smart. How are they gonna be street smart? They've never been in the streets. Yeah. Exactly. If our situation ever changed, how would the boys deal with it? [huffs] woman : The last piece is, the contractor from the New Jersey firm kept records on three different devices. They're all in our possession. Trial is in six weeks. Great work. Thank you, guys. Take it easy this weekend, T., yeah? Yeah, I'll try. Take your kid to the batting cages. Mm. Uh, Bryan, hang in for a second. Let's go over some of the details. [sniffs] Right. [clears throat] [doors close] You have an informant in Axe Capital. Boss, we should stick to the rules of recusal, the old Chinese Wall, shouldn't we? Okay. [clears throat] So we've been profiling all the players and scanning the activity at Axe Cap, and we see this Donnie Caan. Bryan : Usually a mid-level guy, but suddenly, he loads up on Rubinex, a biochem company. Loads  up. I mean, way above his usual range. Chuck : Mm-hmm. The company, miraculously, gets an FDA seal of approval on a product. Even more miraculously... [laughs] Caan is already there, and he sells at a monster profit. [cheering] So I put the agents on, and then they start bloodhounding him. He couldn't provide the research on the trade. He had no sign-offs from compliance. He didn't have dick. And our tech guys were able to pull meta-data that established he'd been in contact with insiders. [man speaks indistinctly] We had him boxed up. He broke like a Mexican condom. [chuckles] [laughs] He agreed to cooperate right away. Lilly : I wanna help you, Lara. And Bobby. Oh. Great. And I would if I were sure, you know? Sure? You're the one who told me. I did. And I feel bad that I started a whole thing, but... Keith told me that we can't have any press right now, that it would f*ck his business badly to be near any of this. His business? He's my husband. Not much else I can say. I have to go. Maid's leaving at 3:00 today. Some bullshit about taking her kids to the doctor. Mm. Bye.

[sighs deeply] We need to get more of the original video, if it exists. It'll tell a totally different story about what happened. Who had this? It's from Mike Dimonda. Says it landed in his in-box this morning. An exclusive. Well, he's doing us a solid. Not so solid. He knows that charges are being filed. He's requesting comment, wants to run something right away. Who filmed that? [sighs] Dimonda won't say. ♪ tense music ♪ Okay. Bobby : There were 11 people in the backyard. There were two on the other side of the pool. They didn't have a good view. The video was from my left side. There were only... six people on my left. One of them was Layner's wife. She was holding a platter. She didn't have an iPhone. Layner's kids were there... ♪ ♪ ♪ ...and his son from his first marriage. It wasn't him either. He was still wet and had his bathing suit on. ♪ ♪ ♪ [Bobby snaps fingers] That kid's girlfriend. There was another girl  standing next to her, about the same age... 17. Neither of them had been in the pool. Each of them had a phone out. Holy sh1t! [laughs] I f*cking love when you do that. Your love is touching, but what I need right now is to find that original video. Find it, pay what we need, get it. ♪ ♪ ♪ [door opens] [door closes] I have to go to the Hamptons. ♪ ♪ ♪ [inhales deeply, exhales slowly] [door clicks] [sighs] [door creaks] Ah. Tommy. How you doing, Chief? I tell you, I've been better. [chuckles] Summers out here enough to make you long for martial law. [laughter] You remember what it's like. Ah, sorry to hear it. Ah, don't be. It'd be better if, in addition to the college kids and regular dirtbags, I didn't have my billionaires punching out my multimillionaires. It's bad for business. Well, that's why we're here, to make your life easier. We wanna quash this thing. No need for news stories. No need for undue chatter. Sure. Of course. I lift the rug, and you guys sweep? Or were you thinking vice versa, and I make with the broom? Come on, Tommy, we both know this is probably gonna end up in a payment situation. Why don't we work together and get there sooner? Uh-huh. Not so easy. I've seen the video. When it goes public, there's gonna be a lot of pressure. So we'll take a statement of Mr. Axelrod's version of events. If Mr. Layner refuses to relent, if he insists on pressing charges, if the DA doesn't like what he hears and chooses to proceed, well, courtesy or not, Chief, it'll be out of my hands. [front door closes] Hey, sweetheart. Hey, baby. What's the latest? [briefcase thuds] Oh, you know. Kevin had a friend over from school. Told Eva she could hang, too, and then pretty much ignored her. How'd that play out? She cried, and then he was nicer. Oh. So a normal weekday afternoon negotiation, huh? Speaking of... Mm-hmm? Mmm. How did the, uh, breakdown of the settlement play out? 'Cause the way you described it didn't sound... Yeah. Well... Well, I'll tell you, uh... Things were all pre-negotiated, laid out. But, you know, these conferences are... unpredictable. Tensions are high. Certain realities set in. [inhales deeply] And, uh, big game fish often has one final thrash in him as he gets close to the boat. [chuckles] [utensil stirring] Anyway, as I said, then... [mouth full] he tore up the check. [bowl thuds] [bottles clink] We have the Gilberts tomorrow night. [refrigerator door closes] They could only get a table at 7:30, so... make sure you can get there in time. No chance of a reschedule? This is the reschedule... [bottle thuds] of  a reschedule. [sighs] What? I don't know. It's just I'm... I'm just a little bit creeped out by how close those two are. They're married. Shouldn't they be close? [sighs heavily] Not  that  close. [liquid pours] Oh, thank you. Mmm. That's great, Ryan. My breakfast kind of sucks. What did you just say? I'm sick of cheese omelettes. The cheese is kind of sticky. No sweat, big guy. What can I make you? Nothing. The omelettes are great, and both of you are finishing them. But these are lame, and we have them, like, almost every day. And dad never makes us finish our plates. First, apologize to Chef Ryan. Gordie and Dean : Sorry. And now let's go. Where? Get in the car. Now. 
 
 [waves crashing, seabirds calling] Gordie : Why is the water brown? It just is. Now get in. [seabirds continue calling] It's cold! I wanna leave. Stop whining, or I'll throw you in. [waves crashing] What are we doing? You're clamming. When I was a kid, me and Aunt Lu and all your uncles, we had to come out here with Grandma and collect 50 clams for Sunday dinner or we didn't eat. And that taught us something about work, about earning our own living. What do we do? You feel with your feet on the bottom for littlenecks. Like this. You shimmy. So how many do you want us to get? Well, you eat what you catch, so you get as many as you can before the tide goes out. When's that? About four hours from now. [waves continue crashing] Raul : You know I didn't drive all the way up here to Westport to give out "attaboys." Had to bring the kick-ass. With love. Rumblings got to me. I hate motherfucking rumblings because truth is always underneath 'em. You hit some guy and knocked him out. Down. Not out. A fine distinction. Thanks, Wags. I hung in after Dollar Bill got arrested, because if anyone knows you can't let one miscreant tattoo a whole place, it's an ex-cop. But if people think you're feeling the pressure, acting out, hitting folks, for f*ck's sake, they will run for the exits. Banks'll even look at you as a shaky investment. Credit'll start drying up. I won't let that happen. The time to not let that happen was before you threw the punch. Last thing I want to do is pull my money, but I will. If you take a conviction, even for a misdemeanor, we are gone. Settle your trouble. Get a non-disclosure form signed. I know. Thanks for coming in person. [sliding door opens, closes] Dimonda said he vetted the story and it's ready to run, with or without comment. Get me a meeting with him before he posts it.

Nancy : No. Yeah? 17 years later, we can't imagine it any other way. We weren't always like this. For the first few years in our marriage, we each had our own lives. Chuck : Mm-hmm. Siloed.

But then, you don't have anything concrete yet. Early days. Mm-hmm. You know, one thing I used to do to informants when I had your job, every few weeks, I'd rough 'em up a little bit. Really made sure they knew the spot I had 'em in. Little motivational session. Yes. I have to meet with him soon, anyway, to give him the script to get Axe to really incriminate himself. Mm-hmm. Mm. You know, Axe knows people everywhere, so make sure you use a secure location. There's a place I've used. Very secure. No chance that Axe is hooked in there.
