 Previously on  Billions ... 
 Bobby : Metallica's playing one North American gig this year. Tonight. Québec. Suspect trading pattern on Pepsum Pharmaceuticals. Ari : Peter Decker, Quaker Ridge Financial. Chuck : At what exact moment did Axelrod instruct you to buy Pepsum Pharmaceuticals? He never instructed me. But you believe it was insider trading? If I had to guess, it was probably "Dollar" Bill. I need to see your trades for the past 90 days. Unless you got a Wells notice with my name on it, you're not gonna see jack sh1t. [lowered voice] Get the FBI on him now. I want this m*therf*cker's genome mapped. Constantine, my old friend. You showed. Of course. I have been at Mundia-Tel my entire career. What people thought was bedrock was really bullshit. Now everyone is going to finally see the truth. Why aren't  you  prosecuting the investment banks and hedge funds for insider trading? [amplified voice] Go ask the 81 convicted felons of financial crimes currently serving time. Don't go all Charles Foster Kane on me. You know I've never seen it. You have to immediately, projected on a big screen on film. The Statue of Liberty attempted bombing case needs to come off your plate. I'm sorry? Eastern needs that case. I've been doing this for two years around the clock. Bobby : So I came up here to unplug and I, you know, can't. How do you do it, man? Hmm. I play, man. Sell everything. Everything? Take it slow, control the bleeding. Then we'll dump sector by sector starting with telecom. People will think... That I'm out. ♪♪♪ [birds chirping] [bicycle spokes whirring] [panting] [metal clanks in distance] [metal tool clanks] Hey, Tito. Morning. [tailgate thuds] [chickens clucking] No blemishes. Air cell one-tenth of an inch. Perfect color. It's beautiful. Double yolker. Give me the odds. About one in a thousand. But I got six in a row once. That's quintillion to one. Franchise that f*cking hen. [chickens continue clucking] Thanks, Tito. Of course. Hey, you wanna trade? Sure. [gravel crackling] [bicycle spokes continue whirring] [cellphone vibrates] [beep] Jesus, Wags. When a guy says sell everything, he gets a chance to take it back. Fair enough. Not gonna. You gotta say it. I already said it. Do it smart, do it so we don't get hurt, but do it. Once we're out of telecom, we get out of tech. Look, if the investors hear about this, they are gonna wonder what the f*ck is going on. No, they're not, 'cause you're gonna call 'em and tell 'em. Tell 'em what? Tell 'em that we're shutting down. Give them the heads up. They can start looking elsewhere. And next week? If you change your mind? Well, let's just get through today. Bye. Please tell me that this fine specimen is our line to Bobby Axelrod. He is. We just need to link him to Pepsum. Then we'll flip him against Axelrod. Mm. How is his, uh, personal life? Dude, it's too perfect. "Dollar" Bill Stearn... devoted family man. Sunday school teacher. Volunteer fireman. Wow, I'm gettin' all weepy-eyed. Guess we gotta let him go. [file thuds] It hasn't even been a week. A week we got nothing. We do have a theory. Finally! Thank you. It's not fully worked out yet. But what Dale is referring to is, uh, Bill Stearn bribed the Pepsum researcher for proprietary information on a drug called Vaccarizine. It's an enzyme they've been testing out in Iowa. Genetically modifies corn so that cows can actually digest without antibiotics and... It makes them sh1t better. I'm sorry, but does this, uh, farm report wind up anywhere near an arrest warrant? Well, we think that there is a nexus between Stearn and the guys who ran the test. We have to just place Stearn in Iowa at the right time... So no. [sighs] Don't tell him part of the story until you know the whole story. Got it. [sighs deeply] All right. Let's go through these bank records. [grunts] Mm. Um... Yeah, what's up? [lowered voice] You still keep emergency deodorant in your office? Yeah, you need some? No. [clears throat] Grandma's recipe. Signature dish at the Empire Diner. I thought Grandma was a waitress. She knew her way around a griddle, too. Bobby : Gotta use enough cinnamon. [utensils clinking] Am I out of a job? Don't worry, Ryan. Breakfast is about all I can handle. Yeah, trust me. We need you back. Wow! [chuckles] Ryan, take the morning off. Be back for lunch? You got it. Thanks. [utensil clinks] [lips smack] Family announcement. New boat's coming early. The big one? Wow. Bobby : Delivery on Friday afternoon. Great. Thinking Europe, end of summer? Mediterranean Milk Run? Nah. Can we go to the Galápagos to meet Lonesome George? Lonesome George is dead. Really? Oh, sh1t. Hey. Language. Galápagos? Galápagos. Nice. How much sooner? [mug clatters] How 'bout next week? [utensil clinks] Yeah, we can. [dishware clinking] If that's the thing to do right now. Well, you know, I was just thinking, boys will be out of school. Perfect time in their lives. Well, maybe it's not the perfect time in my life. Summer at the restaurant, it's gonna be insane. All right, I get that. So we'll set something up so you can stay in touch. Videos. You can take trips home. "We." Did I miss us having a conversation about this somehow? We bought the boat together. We designed it together. Yeah, but we skipped the part when we talk about when and how we're using it. You hate this idea? No, I don't, 'cause I see how much you love it. And I get why it would be a once-in-a-lifetime for them. I'm just... [picks up plate] [sighs deeply] ...trying it on for a sec. Good. Okay, do that. Then let's go. It hit me. Why work so hard if not to do what we want, when we want? ♪ pensive music ♪ Terri : I might've misheard earlier, Sorry? Back there. I think you might've said something like, "Dude, it's perfect," to the US Attorney. I don't think I said "dude." I don't even remember saying "it's perfect." Just repeating what I heard. I'm not doubting you. I just mean, I don't think... I mean... no. Yeah, I'm being a friend here. Wow, did I actually say "dude"? Yeah. Mm-hmm. I did. I said it. The vibe at the law firm I was at before joining the Bureau was serious but relaxed. Okay, well, this is serious but serious. Remove it from your vocabulary. I will. Stat. No, I see. Who... who keeps a year's rent in the bank? I've never missed a payment, never been late at... No, I don't. I don't have a guarantor. Then w-why show me the apartment at all? Just hold the place one more day, please. Thank you. I could do it. Be your guarantor. Don't listen to my calls. Don't leave your door open. How is... Look, thanks, but I wouldn't take your parents' money even if it wasn't against the rules here. You're not taking anything if you don't default. You gonna default? No. You could think about it. We could ask for a waiver or something. And, uh, it's my money. They gave it to me when I turned 25. [whispers] So... [exhales slowly] [gasping, moaning loudly] [continues moaning, gasping] [moans, gasps] [exhales sharply] [moans] I was up till 4 a.m. this morning. I was watching videos of BASE jumpers. There was this guy... he just sails from mountain to mountain in Yosemite. It's incredible. He just... He just takes flight. Soars over the valleys. He's weightless, utterly free. I wanna feel what that's like just once in my life, like I'm saying "f*ck you" to gravity. Didn't that guy die? Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, but, I mean, he wanted to. [chuckles] [chuckles] I gotta go. Come on. Play hooky with me. I can't. I'm handling lunch. And I gotta make arrangements for the restaurant. I can't just disappear. You sure you're ready to do this? I didn't mean to surprise you. Yeah, you did, or you wouldn't have. You don't get carried away. But I know you wanted it to be a good surprise. And it is, once I started getting used to it. [whispers] But I do still have to go set up for it. Okay. Go. I'll amuse myself. [chuckles] Just don't go jumping off any cliffs. I won't. Maybe I'll watch a movie. Inglourious Basterds  again? [laughs] No. I've never seen  Citizen Kane,  projected, the way you're supposed to. Perfect. I'll make a call. Bryan : So what do we got on the, uh, researcher? Clayton Grunwald. Farmer, agricultural scientist for Pepsum for 20 years. One-income household, about 70K, no travel records, no trace of Stearn in Iowa, but I don't buy a relationship like this blooming via phone. Maybe a conference somewhere? Neutral territory? Nothing. Bryan : Then Iowa. Stearn covered his tracks. Didn't fly, paid only cash. Maybe we pay the farmer a visit. What, with nothing? No, no. We... we gotta come heavy. Otherwise, the guy says jack sh1t or he... he just lawyers up. All right. What do cheap guys do? Don't look at me. I treat my queen very well. They go dutch. Every f*ckin' time. Just to be clear... we're frozen? We're not buying, for now. Not Carthill. Don't f*ck me like that. It's a Hondo Havlicek. Can't miss. It is bad timing, I know. But keep on liquidating. We were up north of the timberline. Why are we bailing? We're not bailing. We're pruning, slowly, so we don't scare the market. And keep this on the f*cking DL. We need to be deliberate and delicate about this. Bonsai artists. Since when do we do delicate? Since now. Do we know how long? As long as he wants, Carly. I gotta say, I'm not feeling this strategy. Well, then it's a good thing your feelings aren't a f*cking priority. Thank you for your time. [telephone ringing] Chuck : Dale. [lowered voice] I need you to do something for me. Yes, sir. Somewhere between "sir" and "dude," okay? Yeah. [sighs] I need you to find a woman named Martina Slovis. S-L-O-V-I-S. [under breath] Martina Slovis. She used to live in Cobble Hill. [pouring coffee] Dropped out of Brooklyn Law. And this is only for me. Got it? You know I do. [coffeepot clatters] [clears throat] [bottles clink] [indistinct chatter] Hey. Hmm? We got it. We ran down everything this guy ever signed or signed up for, and on April 25, William Stearn's Silver Elite card was logged into the Downtown Marriott in Des Moines, Iowa. Now he paid cash for the hotel room, but he couldn't turn down the reward points. [laughs] Every man is a junkie for something. Find it, find him, and you did. Yeah. Excellent. Here's our researcher. Clayton Grunwald. We're heading to Iowa to jump him. Aiming to have an affidavit in your hands by Friday. Yeah. Hmm. Christ. Hello, Chuck. I'm sorry. We had a sit-down scheduled. Can we talk? It's okay. You want him here? What have I got to hide? Is it true you've launched a full-scale investigation of Axe Capital? I'm not gonna answer that, and you know it. You have heard the rumors that Axe Capital is shuttering? The word is they're pulling their positions. Hey, Dimonda, my office just charged 17 people in a massive heroin conspiracy in Rockland County, sent a corrupt mayor to prison, and indicted a serial killer. Incredible stories I bet the American people are dying to read about. ♪ tense music ♪ [whispers] What the f*ck? Hey, p-pulling positions? You... you knew about this? [lowered voice] No. Get Sacker to call her hedgie friends. Find out if he's really closing down. You got it. ♪♪♪ [touchscreen clicking] [keys click, computer beeps] [cellphone vibrates] [clicks tongue] [touchscreen clicks] Hey, babe. Uh, hey. Um... which one of us has, uh, softball duty tonight? Mm, it's your turn, I thought. Right, right. Sorry. So much bullshit I'm dealing with here, I lost track. How 'bout you? How are things? At work? Yeah, wherever. Everything's great. Great. I'm about to start a session. I'll call you back, okay? Okay. Love ya. [touchscreen clicks] [cellphone thuds] [sighs] He's still not back. This is  not  good. Well... we've been here before. No, we actually haven't. He wants me to tell our top investors we're winding down. Okay. Wags : I don't know what the f*ck is going on, but this isn't burnout. This isn't, "I gotta go play the Scottish courses" or run away for a week to basketball fantasy camp. This is some kind of bullshit midlife meltdown. Whatever it is, it's not bullshit. For most of human history, we all would've been dead by now. We get to this age and we think, "What the f*ck am I still doing here?" It's disorienting. See, that's what he needs... some of that black magic. Go talk to him. No, it's only been a few days. He's still processing it himself. What do the PMs know? That I need them to close down the positions, not stampede the f*ck out of the corral. But they're instinctive creatures, and without knowing exactly why, they feel antsy, which leads them to feeling restless, which leads to motherfucking anarchy if we don't rein it in. What do I do about the investors? Have Axe talk to them... himself. Make it real for him. [chuckles] Fund is frozen, Axe AWOL. And a couple of junior traders just had a 3-hour lunch at LeFarm. [scoffs] Quick work. Just a couple texts. People are talking. Yeah, because you know how to get 'em talking. Don't poor mouth yourself. [chuckles] We should, uh, get surveillance up on Axelrod. Uh-huh. Sacker : I already told the FBI to be standing by in anticipation of your order. I'll confirm. What the hell is his strategy? He knows we're not gonna give up the hunt just because he closes. Maybe he wants to quit while he's ahead. No one quits while they're ahead. This isn't France. It's America. We think  noblesse oblige  is a new entrée at Olive Garden. [groans] You know, there's a book that could help you with that. Sarno? It didn't. [bones crack] You have to actually read it for it to help. Mm-hmm. I'm not supposed to just shove it up my ass? [chuckles] How solid is your Iowa linkage? Solid. But he has to talk for it to pay off. I'm on it. Chuck : I'm tagging along. [sighs] What? Lot of firepower for one farmer. Research scientist. So... [papers rustling] Why do you have to go? Excuse me? I don't wanna be out of line, but at some point, you might want to consider recusing yourself from this case. The conflict of interest is... eventually, it's... it's gonna be an issue. So... Well... as long as you don't want to be out of line. ♪ tense music ♪ Make sure it's an aisle seat. Barry : How many times you seen it? This'll be my first. Oh, my God. You're in for such a treat. [canister rattles] [imitates Orson Welles as Kane] "You know, Mr. Bernstein, if I hadn't been very rich, I might've been a really great man." Wags, man. What are you doing here? [normal voice] Apologies for violating the restraining order and entering Xanadu, but I got a pile of documents for you to sign. [briefcase thuds] [sighs heavily] [radio clicks and beeps] Barry, clear the booth. Go swimming or something. [radio clicks] Barry :  Sure. [radio thuds] [briefcase thuds, latches clack] You either appoint an independent custodian to handle the final audit or... You give those to the accountants or the lawyers. You handle the investors. I will. [latches click] But you and I both know there are certain ones who deserve a sit-down with you. [scoffs] This is why you're here? Alex Collins. First person to put $10 mil into the fund. Jesus, when did you become such a hoarder? Frances Kingsley. Buchanan University. I get the point. And finally... Raul Gomez. New York City Police Pension Fund. sh1t. Gomez was a game-changer. He was the first real player who saw what we knew we had. What a great day that was. If there is a reason for all of this... a professional one... you know I am the one guy you can tell.

You mind inviting us up to the house? Uh... Special Agent Terri McCue, FBI. Aw, hell. Yeah. Met Bill at a conference a few years ago. Liked him right away. His father was a farmer, so we had a lot in common. He knows what it's like to wake with the sun, tend the animals, live off what you raise. His father was a shoe salesman... in Philadelphia. [wind whistling] ♪ tense music ♪ W-well, he talked like a farmer, knew his stuff. ♪♪♪ We became friends and, uh... And he helped you out. Yep, he did. He helped us out. He showed real kindness to our family. We just closed out Christina's college fund to pay her medical bills. He offered to take care of the surgeries. The best doctors, private air ambulance. Even found us a CF support group. We figured God had decided to send us a miracle. So you gave him the information. Yeah. Yes. It just kinda slipped out. I was talking to a friend. Didn't seem like such a big deal. [mouths word] I mean, I-I realized I had a duty to the company, but I figured, how much difference could it make? About $89 million worth, Clayton. [sighs] sh1t. I'm sorry. Should he have a lawyer for this part? [sets down glass] Well, if you would like a lawyer, Kelly, then, uh, yes. You can call one. Okay. And then, uh, we can arrest your husband and finish this as an interrogation. I-I don't, uh... See, right now, this seems like sort of a friendly conversation, but it's not, really, because we all know that it could turn hard in a different direction. And, uh, there's days that I would push it there. But... I like it out here, and the two of you.

Uh, contact a lawyer before you come or one will be appointed for you. Wait, you said that if we cooperated, that Clayton wouldn't go to jail. I said that I would do everything I could to help. You will be entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. I-I would've called our lawyer if you'd made that clear. [voice breaks] Christina needs us. She needs both of us here.

Who said anything about temporary? We all know he's not insane. We gotta just... enjoy the break. This can be useful, remind us why we love what we do. Uh, I love what I make... or used to. Sure. Money's a big part of it. You remember the first year you pulled down seven figures? Yeah, of course. Wendy : What'd you do with it? Spend it on yourself? Buy something for your families? I bought my mom a washing machine. What the f*ck? [laughter] She was doing laundry by hand. It's hard on the joints. Yeah, so you buy her a house with a maid, not an appliance from Sears, you cheap f*ck. [Carly laughs] What about you, Pouch? I put it all into retirement. [chuckles] Oh, you pussy. And I staked a couple of fighters, which was a mistake. Yeah, well, I got a quick 5K you can make if you got the stomach for it. Ah, behold, the Hand of the King descends to walk among the rabble. Hey, Wags, two of my kids just got hired at Morgan Capital. Hmm. Funny you're complaining to me, considering they're  your  kids. Jones : I'm ready. Bill : Aw, yeah! It's time!

Axelrod has round-the-clock security. Rumor is they do random bug sweeps. Since Dale's been on him, we've never seen the house empty once. What's your point, Bryan? I know this is a touchy subject, but for your own sake, this brings us back to the subject of recusal. I think you should reconsider. [knish thuds] And I think that  you  should stop f*cking the help. [inhales sharply, scoffs] Still nothing. No movement. She's still in there. ♪♪♪ So when are you leaving? Next week. New yacht's arriving this afternoon. Most beautiful boat you have ever seen. Designed every inch of it ourselves. Last year, we went to visit it at the shipyard in Estonia. We're gonna sail it down to the Galápagos, Buenos Aires. Who knows where else? Everywhere. When I was at Metallica, I just had this feeling... it was so brief... that there was some other kind of life I could be living. In each of us, there is another self we do not know.

Don't make Wags do it. You owe them that respect. [knock on door] Uh, little problem. How little? Well, uh, an FJ article is about to drop by Michael Dimonda. It's not flattering. All right, what does it say? [glasses clack] Well, um... [chuckles] Oh, for Christ's sake, rip the Band-Aid off. Come on. It says that you're investigating Axe Capital. And how is that a problem? Of course that was gonna leak. Well, it also says that you're hesitating on pulling the trigger because of a family conflict. Uh-huh. Like preferential treatment, because your wife works... Yes, I got it. Thank you. How is it sourced? Someone inside the office, senior official, highly placed. How do you know it's a senior official? Because it quotes a senior official familiar with the matter. Okay. I see. Very good. Thank you. [door closes] [sighs] [clears throat] You've reached Wendy Rhoades. Please leave a message. [cellphone thuds] [papers rustle] Can't say that I'm happy right now, but I do want to thank you for meeting with me in person. Bobby : Of course. Taking on the Police Fund as a client was one of the proudest moments of my life. You know, Lara comes from three generations of cops. Her grandpa walked a beat on... Bushwick. Of course I know. I deeply appreciate you taking a flyer on us back then, when no one else would. You were a cocky prick with terrible table manners, but I knew there was something. I didn't keep my money at Axe Cap because I like you. [rock music playing over speakers] If you pull up stakes, you're handing me a $1.5 billion problem. Time comes, I'll find you another fund. Like who? Rangewater? Yeah, for example. Solid returns. Smart guys. Overleveraged, though. Then PKZ. No way. They have no idea how to manage risk. None. No f*cking clue how to short. Bear market, you're paying 2% to underperform Vanguard. So you're starting to see the problem. Picking a fund's not that different from picking a stock. I'll find you a winner. man : Here you go, guys. [bottles thud] ♪♪♪ First Solar. Late July 2007. No. No, you're not making me do this again. As long as I'm an investor in this company, I'll... Okay. Okay. 2007, mid-July. Broke out in good volume. Went up to around 120. We were out of the sector till August. We left millions on the table. That was on me. Google. Mid-June 2004. That's a trick question. Didn't go public till August. IPO'd $19.6 mil shares at 84. Closed at $100.34. It was a good day for both of us. [chuckles] Cyberonics. August 2004. Started mid-20s, went to 40s. Then the FDA dinged its nerve stimulator, and the stock tanked at 13. We saw it coming. Everyone else was trying to catch a falling knife. We made $7.4 mil that day. [laughs] How'd I do? How the hell would I know? I remember I gave you a quiz like that the first time we met. And it wasn't the fact that you knew so much. It was how you lit up. These companies are living organisms to you. And I knew that if I gave you my money, that you wouldn't sleep until you put it in all the right places.
