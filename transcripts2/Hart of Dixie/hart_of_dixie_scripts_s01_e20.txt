 Lavon and I had an affair. 
 I cannot tell you how sorry I am. 
 Well, you don't have to, 'cause it's over. 
 Magnolia told me George broke off the wedding-- what's going on? 
 I cheated on George. Did you really think that  about me, that I'm snobbish and shallow? 
 Yeah, I do. Turns out that 
 Lemon wasn't my destiny, so now it's my job  to go find out who that destiny is. 
 What is that look on your face? 
 Hope. 
 'Cause now I know that George and I would be... that we could be great together.

 (knocking) 
 Uh... 
 Zoe? 
 Um... 
 George? One sec.

 (panting) 
 (sniffs, clears throat) 
 Come in! 
 (exhales) 
 (low groan) 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Um, I'm... sorry it's a little early. 
 I was just, uh... 
 I was kind of up all night wanting to talk to you. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 That's okay. 
 I-I'm glad you're here. 
 How did it go last night with Lemon? 
 It was hard. Um... 
 I yelled a lot, she cried... a lot, and, uh... told her the wedding was off. 
 You did? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Uh, I'm sorry, um, are you okay? 
 I will be. 
 Definitely. 
 Possibly. I mean, I-I hope so. 
 (laughs): I'm sorry, I'm flustered. 
 That's okay. 
 So am I. 
 Look, uh... 
 I can't stop thinking about last night. 
 It was possibly the best night of my life. 
 Me, too. 
 But, um... we kind of got a little swept away. 
 You know? 
 I know. We did. 
 We so did. Yeah. 
 I'm just coming out of a 15-year relationship, so, you know, I was thinking that maybe jumping right into another one might not be fair for anyone... 
 Right. 
 And, um... you know what they say: you know, it's better to be fair than not fair. 
 I think they say that. 
 Yeah, and this is gonna sound real clichéd, but... 
 I was just, um... 
 (sighs) 
 Maybe ife t's okay with you, uh, for now, we could just stay friends? 
 Just... 
 Friends. Yeah. 
 Absolutely. 
 You know, uh, that is... that is so the right thing, and I was going to suggest it, even. 
 George : Great. Okay. 
 Oh. Hey, Tucker. 
 Didn't expect to see you here so early. 
 I hope I'm not interrupting. 
 Lavon, he-he injured his ankle pretty badly, so... 
 Yeah. 
 'Kay, I'll be right there. 
 I guess I'll see you around... pal. 
 Thanks for... 
 Yeah. 
 How on earth did you fall out of a tree? 
 We were training for the BlueBell Battle. 
 Yeah, and there's $5,000 at stake. 
 And we got to be able to do anything. 
 Bull riding, building plantations out of macaroni, eating bugs. 
 So what's the verdict, he gonna be okay? 
 Wha... What, you still ignoring me? 
 Ask her if you're gonna be okay for the race. 
 Look, this is ridiculous. 
 Zoe, can I be in the race? 
 Nope. 
 Please? 
 No. You have a bad sprain. 
 You have to keep it stable until the swelling goes down. 
 This is great. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, everything bad happens to me! 
 (sighs) 
 I have an idea. 
 How about to distract you from your pain we talk about what happened to me this morning. 
 George came over. 
 Uh-huh. 
 He and Lemon are calling off the wedding. 
 But he says that we just have to stay friends for now. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I was upset at first, because I know he felt what I felt in New Orleans. 
 But then I realized he said "for now," meaning in the future, after a respectable grieving period, George and I will finally be together. 
 Isn't that great? 
 Look, whenever I say anything about you and George Tucker, you either don't listen to me or you get angry. 
 So from now on, all I'm gonna say is... 
 "No comment." 
 Okay. That's fair. 
 But... how long of a grieving period do you think people need after 15 years? 
 Couple weeks? 
 Oh, mm-mm. 
 A month? 
 Not-not two months. 
 Right? Lavon? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Well, hello, George, Lemon. 
 What brings you two lovebirds here today? 
 Well, uh, Reverend Mayfair, um... 
 Lemon and I have decided to call off our wedding. 
 (laughs) 
 That's funny. 
 (stops laughing) 
 Oh, you're not... you're not kidding. 
 Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't understand. Uh... what happened? 
 Well, it's a long story, and... neither of us are looking to point fingers right now. 
 We'd just, well... (sighs) like your advice on how best to deal with this. 
 Well, I will help in any way I can. 
 But let me ask you, now, is this something that the both of you are certain you want? 
 Lemon : No. 
 It's not what I want, Reverend, it's not. 
 Lemon... 
 See, George is... angry. 
 He is furious, and... who can blame him? 
 He just found out that I was having an affair. 
 Uh, what, now? 
 It was a year ago, and it was a... horrible mistake. 
 And I know that the wedding is coming up in two weeks and that may not be enough time for George to forgive me, but I will do anything for another chance. 
 Well... thank you for that, Lemon. 
 I know that wasn't easy. 
 George, what Lemon did was an enormous transgression, one that I can't expect you to take lightly, but clearly, she still loves you. 
 Now, is there any hope that, in time, you will be able to forgive her? 
 This isn't about forgiveness, Reverend, this is about our relationship, and the foundation of our relationship is broken. 
 And... 
 (clears throat) 
 I don't know if I love her anymore. 
 Now, now, you "don't know." 
 Now, that's a key phrase. 
 George, you're in pain. 
 Pain, sometimes it can cloud the truth, which is why I cannot, in good conscience, let you end this without at least trying counseling. 
 Now, just to find some clarity, please, just a few sessions. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Wade : Look, Tom,  I wouldn't be asking if I weren't desperate. 
 But, uh... what are your plans for the BlueBell Battle? 
 Well, I was gonna be one of those guys who hands out orange slices. 
 I'm no good under pressure. 
 I choke. 
 (Tom gulps, chokes) 
 (coughs) 
 Hi, Wanda. 
 Hi. Hello. 
 I like your sweater, Tom. 
 The puppies really bring out your eyes. 
 That's why my mom got it for me. 
 I was wondering... would you be my partner for the BlueBell Battle? 
 (coughs) 
 Yes. Yes. Yes. 
 Wanda : Great. 
 I'll see you then. 
 Tansy : Bye. 
 (quietly): Did you hear that? 
 That's our first date! 
 Yeah, I heard. 
 I am never washing this sweater again! 
 (laughs) 
 I know how much you want that prize money. 
 I wish I could do the race with you. 
 Me, too. 
 That stupid rule that says you got to live in BlueBell. 
 Well, we'll just have to find you the perfect partner. 
 Which, let's face it, wasn't Tom Long, anyway. 
 What are you looking for in a teammate? 
 Well... (clears throat) my assets are, uh... 
 A) Know this town like the back of my hand; Mm-hmm. 
 B) Mechanical; C) Wily; Wily. 
 D) I can hold my breath for three minutes, you know that? 
 Oh. 
 But... 
 I'm not traditionally book-smart, especially when those books have something to do with math. 
 And ideally, I'd find a partner who, uh, has good, fine motor skills, 'cause I can barely thread a needle. 
 You need Zoe Hart. 
 (laughs) 
 She's a surgeon; she can fit in small spaces. 
 You just have to make her take off those heels. 
 Zoe Hart would never be my partner. 
 Why? 
 Y-You're not still hung up on her, are you? 
 No, no, no, it's not that. 
 Uh... she overheard me say some... unkind-- but true-- things about her recently, and, uh, well, she's pissed at me. 
 Well, I can think of 5,000 reasons this is a good time to apologize. 
 (quiet chuckle) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Rose : Zoe! 
 Hi. 
 I have huge news. 
 Mm, what? 
 Okay, well, as you know, ever since Magnolia broke up with Frederick Dean, I've been dropping hints, hoping, and yesterday he finally asked me out. 
 Oh, whoo-hoo! 
 See? It was only a matter of time before these men pick the right girl. 
 I know. But there's just one problem: my mom won't let me date till I'm 15. 
 Oh, no. I'm so sorry. 
 No, no, please, you have to talk to her. 
 Tell her that there is no sound reason that I have to wait for my arbitrary birthday to live my life. 
 You're a doctor-- just tell her that this can cause developmental issues. 
 Rose, no, I cannot interfere with her parental decisions. 
 Please? My stomach is in knots about this. 
 I can't even eat. 
 You of all people know how I feel about Frederick Dean. 
 I... do know. 
 Yes, I know that... you have waited patiently for him to finally break up with his girlfriend, and you've dutifully been his friend while he got over it. 
 And I know that now it is... your time to be happy. 
 So... yes, I will talk to your mother. 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
 Hey, George. 
 Buddy. 
 How'd it go with the minister? 
 Well, not exactly as planned. 
 He, um... convinced us to do counseling. 
 Hey. Well, that's cool. 
 I think it's ridiculous myself, but I don't know, I guess there might be some merit to it. 
 That... yeah. 
 I think that, uh, therapy is a great idea. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Well, thank you for understanding all this. 
 I'm real lucky to have you in my life, Zoe. 
 Oh. (chuckles) 
 (sighs) 
 (groaning) 
 Counseling never works, right? 
 It's a well known fact. 
 Tony Soprano was in counseling for, like, the entire series. 
 Did he stop killing people? No. 
 And she was a really good therapist. 
 No comment. 
 Zoe : Whoa! 
 You can't just barge in here. 
 I'm with a patient. 
 It's Lavon. 
 But... you're right. 
 I apologize. 
 What do you want? 
 Look, I know you're angry at me, so, I'm sorry or whatever, but I'm hoping we can put that behind us so you'll be my partner in the race tomorrow. I... think we could be a really good team. 
 (laughs) 
 That's funny. 
 That was a good one. 
 Oh, you're not joking? 
 (door closes, Zoe sighs) 
 What is with that guy? 
 Mayfair : I'm so glad that you've both agreed to be here. 
 It's a huge step. 
 And, uh, with the wedding right around the corner, we have to try to do a lot in a small amount of time. 
 Now, uh, you ready? 
 Yes. 
 Great. 
 Let's begin. 
 George... 
 I appreciate what a kind heart you have. 
 I appreciate how selflessly you give yourself to anyone who's in need. 
 I appreciate your sweet green eyes. 
 Mayfair : That's wonderful, Lemon. 
 George, your turn. 
 Lemon... 
 ...I appreciate that you feel that way. 
 So, use the paddles to express your emotions right now. 
 Go ahead. 
 Yeah, you know what, Reverend? 
 Think there's got... 
 I... I think that this is not possibly the-the best way to... 
 Let it out, George. 
 Let it out. 
 I think there's got to be... there's got to be... 
 Go ahead. 
 ...got to be a better way. 
 There's just got to be a better way. 
 Let it go. 
 Just-Just... 
 Just stop it! 
 (gasps) 
 Would you just, just stop?! 
 (whimpering) 
 (sighs) 
 (gasps) 
 Apparently, very mad at that thing. 
 Well, no one said this was going to be easy, but I'd like you to try one last thing before we give up. 
 Anything, anything. 
 No. Come on. 
 Anything. 
 Now, I know you two are still signed up for the BlueBell Battle. 
 I'd love for you to go through with it. 
 Oh, yes. 
 Why on earth would we do that? 
 It's a day of working together, communicating, seeing what you can accomplish as a team. 
 And, well, as metaphors go, it's, uh, pretty darn solid. 
 You know what? No. 
 I think it's a great idea. 
 No, no and no. 
 It's a... 
 Yes, oh, yes. 
 Yes. 
 I-I... 
 Now, George, now, I don't want to have to play the big G card on you here, but I am your minister, and I know that he would want you to take one last shot before you throw away 15 years of... of history. 
 (laughs) 
 Yeah, Irma, just out of curiosity, as one who loves facts and figures, what is the final day that I can cancel the catering for the wedding and, uh, still get my money back? 
 Oh, yeah, as in two days from now. I see, uh... 
 (door opens) 
 Oh, yeah, uh, just keep taking those aspirin every four hours, yeah. 
 Good-bye. 
 Lemonade! 
 Hi, Daddy. 
 You are looking so much brighter. 
 Therapy is working! 
 He forgave you? 
 Well, not yet, but he agreed to do the BlueBell Battle with me! 
 Oh. Well, that is great, but the wedding...? 
 Well, I mean, technically it's still off, but all tomorrow, we will be working in close quarters, under extreme conditions, and we will connect again. 
 And when we win, there's no way that George will be able to deny that we still belong together. 
 Brick : That is just great... 
 Does the wall have a murmur? 
 I was just listening to a crazy termite hatching a crazy plan that absolutely will not work. 
 Okay. Well, do you need to listen anymore? 
 Because we were supposed to go talk to my mom. 
 Right. I'm coming. 
 Stupid Zoe Hart. 
 It's her loss, because you're gonna win that prize money, I'm sure. 
 You always got my back, Tans. 
 You know how I'm gonna thank you? 
 I'm gonna take 30 bucks out of that five K tomorrow, and I'm gonna take you for dinner after the race. 
 Why don't I cook dinner for you? 
 Just in case. 
 Well, all right, then. 
 My place it is. 
 (laughs) 
 Woman : Hi, baby. 
 Hi. 
 Zoe, it's nice to see you. 
 You, too. 
 Are you gonna be joining us for dinner? 
 Oh, no, thanks. 
 I actually just want to talk to you about Rose. 
 Oh, no! She doesn't have one of those teenage scary things  that I've seen on The View? 
 Um, texting thumb, or-or tanorexia? 
 No, no. I'm-I'm fine. 
 She's fine. 
 It's just that this lovely young man named Frederick Dean has asked young Rose out on a date. 
 I know technically she isn't allowed till her birthday, but I thought maybe you would consider reconsidering. 
 He seems like a nice boy. 
 But a rule is a rule. 
 Zoe : But you know, what if Frederick and Rose did the race tomorrow? 
 It's not a date, and it is a fitness activity, and it's completely in public. 
 Well, a race sounds pretty harmless. 
 Fine. You win. 
 Thanks, Mom. 
 All right, well, I'm gonna get us some menus. 
 You know, I love this place, but the service is never really more than a six. 
 A race? Really? 
 That's not what I had in mind for my first date. 
 This is gonna be better! 
 You know, I used to do this kind of stuff. 
 My mom would send me to sleepaway camp, you know. 
 The stakes were high, it was fun, but so intense. 
 You couldn't help but deeply connect with your partner. 
 That's how a lot of camp love affairs started. 
 I guess you're right. 
 I need to go take care of something. 
 (clears throat) 
 Hi. 
 What? 
 Do you still need a partner for that race thing tomorrow? 
 'Cause I was thinking it actually might be a good way for me to drum up some patients. 
 I don't know. 
 I'll let you keep all the money. 
 Done. 
 Great. 
 Believe me, Wade Kinsella, we are going to win everything we want. 
 (crowd chatter) 
 George, thank you again for doing this for me. 
 Lavon : Zoe, what are you doing here? 
 I'm limbering up. 
 Don't want to pull a hammy. 
 Why are you in this race? 
 Because I can't let Lemon just weasel her way back into George's heart. 
 I need to show George that I am in this race, too. 
 So, that's why I am joining the race. 
 It's a huge gesture, Lavon! 
 There's no way George could miss it. 
 No comment. 
 BRICK (over microphone): Attention! 
 Attention, ladies and gentlemen. 
 It's a great pleasure for me to welcome everyone to our own BlueBell Battle! 
 (applause, cheering and whooping) 
 A series of challenges that will test y'all like you've never been tested before. 
 And to the last team standing goes the coveted Golden Bell and $5,000. 
 (applause and cheering) 
 (Wade trills) 
 Is everyone ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Teams, on your mark. 
 (crowd chatter) 
 And... 
 Whoo! 
 Go, go, go, go, go! 
 (overlapping, excited chatter) 
 (cheering) 
 Go, go, go! 
 So we have to assemble the wheelbarrow, and then, the next clue will be revealed. 
 Manual labor isn't really my thing. 
 Dang instructions! 
 How do you even unfold...? 
 Oh, this might be the... Yup. 
 There it is. 
 I unfolded 'em! 
 Oh. 
 It's just a standard model. 
 Five and a half cubic feet load capacity. 
 Let's go with the three-quarter-inch hex bolt and lock nut. 
 You're like the girl of my dreams, and the girl I made on my computer all rolled into one. 
 Lemon : See, this isn't so bad. 
 It's such a beautiful day! 
 It is just so nice when two people can work together in quiet without all those pesky words. 
 What are you doing?! 
 The instructions say to do that part later. 
 See? In Diagram 8H. 
 I don't do instructions, all right, Doc? 
 Wade! 
 Just give me a sec, okay? 
 Oh... Shoot! 
 I cannot believe you! 
 I was doing fine until... until you come in here with all your buzzing and your bossing in my ear, and suddenly, suddenly, I'm distracted. 
 (whooping and applause) 
 We have to stop fighting, okay? 
 It's not getting us anywhere. 
 Neither is this wheelbarrow. 
 Lavon : Hey, Tansy. 
 Uh, come on in. 
 Come on in. 
 I'm sorry to bother you. 
 I was gonna make Wade dinner tonight, but his spice rack is basicaly just some take-out ketchup packets and what hopefully were old raisins. 
 I was wondering if I could borrow your kitchen for a bit? 
 Oh, no problem. 
 Okay. 
 Happy for the company. 
 Laid up here on injured reserve, so... 
 So, uh, you and, uh, Wade and dinner? 
 Does that mean...? 
 He does really seem to want to change. 
 Let's just hope wanting is the same as doing. 
 I hear that. 
 So, what you making? 
 Chicken and mashed potatoes. 
 Hmm. 
 But I want to make a real fancy dessert, like a parfait or a soufflé, crÃ¨me brÃ»lée? 
 I don't know. Something "A." 
 I really want to make it special. 
 Tansy, please don't take this the wrong way, but, uh... have you ever cooked before? 
 I'm kind of a take-out, ketchup kind of girl myself. 
 Ah. (laughs) 
 Would you care for some help? 
 Only on the dessert. 
 Okay. 
 And the entree. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, Zoe and Wade, welcome to Challenge Number Four. 
 This is a multi-step event, and you better get cracking, 'cause you're in eighth place! 
 All right, let's go! 
 Doc, what are you doing? 
 Hurry up. 
 Oh, Rose, Frederick, I hate to tell you this, but you're the last to arrive. 
 That means you're out. 
 After only three events? 
 Darn it! 
 Yeah, shoot. 
 Hey, want to go to The Dixie Stop and get a milkshake? 
 Okay! 
 Zoe : So why is this prize money so important to you anyway? 
 You're gonna think it's stupid. 
 No, I won't. 
 I want to open my own bar. 
 I was gonna use the 5K to start it up. 
 And, uh, you know... with a little luck, maybe turn it into something. 
 Go ahead. Laugh. 
 Why would I laugh at that? 
 I think that's a really good idea, Wade. 
 Good for you. 
 See, look at us. 
 The minister was right. 
 We have what it takes; we're winning. 
 That just proves that we can do anything if we try. 
 Look, all it proves is that I'm motivated to have this race end as quickly as possible. 
 But George, I mean, you can't deny that we're still... we're us. 
 Lemon, the us that you knew doesn't exist anymore. 
 I know that, but... 
 And the fact that we make a good Bluebell Battle team doesn't change the fact that you had an affair... 
 I know that... or that I kissed Zoe Hart in New Orleans. 
 I'm gonna get some more corn. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Wade... do, um, Southern men understand gestures? 
 Oh, depends on the gesture, I guess. 
 Some of them, we get real well. 
 Like this big Bluebell race. 
 I mean, it's not really my thing, yet I did it. 
 That's a big deal, right? 
 So, you didn't do this to get patients? 
 (laughs): No. 
 Look, uh... 
 I-I think it's still a little confusing. 
 Men don't do subtle, Doc. 
 I think you'd really better... spell it out clearly for us. 
 You're right. 
 Thanks, Wade. 
 You're welcome. 
 Lavon : Slice and bake cookies are genius. 
 You slice, you bake, bam! 
 I can handle that. 
 And we got a lot of wine. 
 'Cause a lot of wine will make any meal taste better. 
 Tansy : Wade! 
 How's it going? 
 Hey, w-we're coming on strong. 
 Uh, Tans, I got to cancel the dinner plans tonight. 
 I'm sorry, but, uh, you know, there's like this after party thing for all the contestants at the Rammer Jammer. 
 So, you know, I should be there, as the winner. 
 (laughs) 
 Uh, rain check? 
 No biggie. Good luck. 
 All right. Thanks. 
 I'll see you guys later. Bye. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 Wade : Thank you, miss. 
 Chop sticks, extra napkins. 
 Hey. 
 Why'd cancel on Tansy like that? 
 Lavon, something is happening with Zoe. 
 I don't know exactly how to explain it. 
 But it's like finally we're clicking. 
 You and Zoe? 
 I-I know. I know it sounds crazy, but trust me, all right? 
 All right, wish me luck. 
 All right. 
 All right, I'll see you later. Bye. 
 Wish me luck! 
 Wade : Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
 Good luck. 
 Whoa, Doc. You sewed that fast. 
 Fastest whip stitch in three counties. 
 Don't slow down now. 
 I got to get more hay. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Okay. 
 Zoe, Hey. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 I-I know you're trying to make some... big gesture to George by competing in this race... 
 I know what you're gonna say, and I totally agree. 
 That was a crazy plan. 
 Yes, it was. 
 I'm, uh, glad you see that 'cause... 
 'Cause a gesture isn't gonna be enough. 
 George won't know how I feel unless I spell it out for him, so the first moment he's alone, I'm gonna lay it all on the line. 
 Look, Zoe, I know how you feel about George, but you're in this contest with Wade. 
 I don't want to see him get hurt. 
 Why would he get hurt? 
 We are working so well together today. 
 We might even win the money for his bar. 
 Zoe... 
 I-I really don't get how you still don't know this. 
 But Wade... 
 likes you. 
 What?! 
 No. Okay, maybe, maybe he did before, but not anymore-- definitely not. 
 Just be careful 'cause he's a good guy. 
 And he really has no clue that you're only working with him to get to someone else. 
 Wade : Hey, Doc! Doc! 
 You'll never believe it. 
 Ben and Babs Foster, donezo. 
 You and me, third place. 
 And it's all thanks to your, you know, quick surgeon sewing. 
 See y'all later. 
 Wade : All right. 
 (loud slurping) 
 Hey, did you know that astronauts can't belch? 
 Well, in space. 
 On land, they can. 
 You gonna drink that shake? 
 Okay. 
 It's a really nice night, isn't it? 
 Look how clear that sky is. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Do you know what this is a perfect night for? 
 Taking a moonlight walk and gazing at the stars? 
 Night fishing. 
 We should go to Old Babcock Pond. 
 It'll be great. 
 Night fishing? 
 Sure. Yeah, let's go catch some fish. 
 (loud slurping) 
 All right. 
 We have our rod. 
 All we have to do now is use this to get the magnetic fish off the church, and we win this whole thing, Tom. 
 Five thousand dollars. 
 You did it! 
 You did it all! 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I feel like I've hogged all the activities. 
 It's one downside to being the only girl in a family of five boys. 
 So this one... you should do. 
 Me? 
 Yeah. 
 Me. 
 I forgive you for kissing Zoe Hart. 
 You what? 
 You were lashing out because you were... hurt and you were angry. 
 And it's... it's understandable. 
 You got to be kidding me. 
 What? 
 George, please just talk to me... 
 I don't know, it's just, you know, ever since Zoe gets to town, you have been worried that something's gonna happen between us. 
 And then I tell you that I kissed her... and you don't care. 
 What?! No. 
 I didn't say I didn't care, George. 
 Lemon, are you so obsessed we're having this wedding that you can't see that we have real problems here? 
 I am obsessed with the wedding because I want to marry you, George. 
 All right? I love you. 
 Yeah, all right. Guess what? 
 Love... it ain't gonna fix anything anymore. 
 Because our relationship should be just... it's... 
 (snap) 
 It's broken. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 I don't want it to go to your head or anything, but... 
 I really appreciate you being out here. 
 I couldn't have made it this far without you. 
 Boy, you're complimenting me? 
 What, are you sick or dying or something? 
 Zoe, I think I need to spell something out for you pretty clearly. 
 Uh, well, I tried to take you to the airport once to tell you there. 
 I tried to tell you a few different times, but... 
 I guess I'm just gonna come right out and say it. 
 Rose : Zoe! 
 I need you. 
 Rose, you're a little pale. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Rose : No. Everything is not okay. 
 The date is going terribly. 
 Fredrick Dean wants to go to Old Babcock Pond to catch fish. 
 Rose : I'm wearing a new dress. 
 Do I look like I want to dig for worms? 
 Ew. No. 
 I know! 
 Um, hello. 
 Ladies, seriously? 
 Old Babcock Pond is, like, a legendary make out spot. 
 Fredrick Dean asked you to go there so he could, you know, get all up in your tonsils. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Wait, are you serious? 
 Zoe, I've never kissed anyone before. 
 No. I'm so nervous, I feel sick. 
 My stomach hurts so bad. 
 I can't do this. 
 Rose, those are just butterflies. 
 The question is, do you want to kiss Fredrick Dean or not? 
 Of course I do. 
 Then go make it happen. 
 Okay. 
 All right. Okay. 
 Okay! 
 Whoa. Whoa. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Wade : Hey, Tom Long is totally choking over there. 
 What if you... 
 I know. 
 We have a chance to actually win this thing. 
 I need to go get a Phillips Head screwdriver. 
 I'll be, I'll be right back. Okay? 
 Hold on. 
 I'll be right back! 
 George, where are you going? 
 Tell the judges we're out. 
 Our rod's broken. 
 We can't win now. 
 Hey, don't you quit on me, George Tucker. 
 You may not love me right now, but I have enough love for the both of us. 
 Enough love to get us through this until you can learn to forgive me and love me again, all right? All right, I'm not finished with you, George. 
 And I'm willing to do anything that it takes to win you back. 
 (whispers): Now. 
 Tell him now. 
 Crap. 
 Zoe : George! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Zoe : Look, here's the thing. 
 I lied before. 
 I don't want to be just friends. 
 I joined this race to fight for you. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 Zoe... 
 I know. 
 I know it's such bad timing... but I want you to know that I'll wait for you. 
 I'll wait, no matter how long it takes. 
 Just please don't get back with Lemon. 
 'Cause George... 
 (nervous laugh) 
 Brick : Lemon! 
 Brick : Honey, what are you doing up there? Come on down. 
 Brick : Lemon, Come on, get down from there. 
 You're gonna break your neck. 
 No! I'm not giving up on us, George. 
 I'm gonna get that fish and we're gonna win this race! 
 Zoe : Wade! 
 50 screws and bolts all over the grass-- we're never gonna win now. 
 Let me help you. 
 No, just stop, okay? 
 Just stop! 
 Forget about it. 
 There's no point, okay? 
 There's no point! 
 It's over. 
 And thank you for costing me $5,000. 
 Thank you for that. 
 Wade, I-I'm so sorry. 
 I cannot believe... that I didn't see this from the beginning. 
 You never wanted to help me. 
 The only thing you wanted was what you always do. 
 Him. 
 And you are... you are so obsessed with getting what you want, you don't care who you hurt along the way. 
 Well, let me tell you something, Zoe Hart, George Tucker and Lemon Breeland are getting married. 
 That is how this story ends. 
 Why does everyone in this town see that but you? 
 George : Lemon, come on, get down from there. 
 You're starting to give people a scare. 
 (Lemon gasps) 
 George : Lemon! Lemon! 
 (gasps, laughs) 
 Lemon : George... I'm gonna fall. 
 No, Lemon, listen to me, you're not gonna fall. 
 I think I'm gonna fall. 
 Just-just slide back towards the roof, okay? 
 Just-just one step at a time; you can do this. 
 Lemon : I can't move, George! 
 I can't move. 
 Okay... okay, Lemon, you stay right there, you hang on. 
 I'm-I'm coming. 
 I'm coming. 
 Lemon : Hurry, George! George, hurry, please! 
 (grunts) 
 Hurry! 
 You know, most people don't know it, but you actually catch better fish at night. 
 Particularly spotted bass. And... spotted bass like to eat worms... 
 Oh, my gosh. Frederick, I thought we were on a date. 
 We are. Right? 
 Then why are we talking about fish and worms? 
 I-I thought you liked science, and... 
 I wanted you to know I respect you, as a woman. 
 I didn't want you to think I just wanted to take you out here to kiss you or something. 
 But we're on a date, and I've been sitting here all night with a stomachache waiting for you to kiss me. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 (sobbing) 
 Okay, Lemon, I'm here. 
 I'm here. Okay. 
 George... 
 All right, Lemon, I'm right here. 
 You feel my hand? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 One step at a time. Just... slide this way. 
 Oh, God... (trembling) 
 (sighs) 
 Right in here. 
 All right. 
 Oh, God... 
 George : Come on. 
 Come on.
