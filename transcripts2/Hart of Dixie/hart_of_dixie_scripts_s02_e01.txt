 George Tucker and Lemon Breeland are getting married. 
 That is how this story ends. 
 I thought you knew I decided to stay. He still has feelings for me. He chose Lemon. Now, you show up at that wedding, he's gonna chose her again. George : Lemon, I cannot marry you,  not when a part of me is in love with someone else. Doc, I'm not saying I want to marry you. All I'm saying is there's something here. Zoe, I thought that if you went to New York, I might be able to put you out of my mind  and maybe I could have, but now I know that I can't. And I don't want to. Tom : It's devastating. Before today, I never really knew what "torn asunder" meant. I think we know who's to blame. You're right, the Lord's hand is in all things. I'm seeing someone else's hand in this one. (Phone ringing) (Door opens, closes) Annabeth : Move back. You don't want to be the first thing she sees when she wakes up. She may swallow you whole before you can blink. It is heartbreaking. Shh! Shh! Lemon was supposed to move into George's place today. And I was gonna move into her room! Magnolia, this is not about you. Lemon has been planning her future with George Tucker for years. What is she gonna do now?! Annabeth : It is no worse than Jake leaving me. I survived and Lemon will, too. Lemon is not like you. She cares what people think. I care what people think. Then, sweetheart, reconsider that dress. How is she gonna walk through this town again? The humiliation. Personally, I would up and die if it happened to me. Up and die. I said move back. Lavon, Lavon, Lavon, Lavon. Lavon! Mmm. Hi. Well, I can't say I'm surprised to see you. I know. I heard. Oh, God. Oh, no. I can explain. What is there to explain? George cancelled his wedding, presumably, for you. Oh, George. Yeah, George. He did. So why don't you look happier? Okay, I'm just going to tell you because I have to tell someone. Don't judge. Okay. Last night, while George was calling off his wedding, I was kinda having s*x with Wade. Wade? Mm-hmm. (Laughing) Hey! And how'd that work out for you? Let's just say I finally understand what R. Kelly's been singing about all these years. But it was more than amazing s*x. Wade and I... connected. Maybe there's more to him than I thought. You know, if George hadn't showed up last night, Wade and I might... Wow. But George did show up. Exactly. And George is George. You know how I feel about him. Zoe Hart, you went from no boyfriends to two in one night. Turns out that I have way more game than I thought. Question is, which one are you gonna keep? Exactly. Which one, Lavon? That question was for you. Yeah, but I don't know. And you're my best friend. So, you need to advise me. Look inside your soul. Picture me with both guys. Who I look happier with? You really need to get a girlfriend. I know, but you're all I have. Oh... (Sigh) Look, all I know is that Wade just slept with the girl that he's been pining for for months, George just called off his wedding for the girl he's been pining for for months. One of them is going to get hurt. But if it was me, I would be honest with both of them before it blows up in your face. That's your best idea? I really do need a girlfriend. Or you could cash in your honeymoon tickets and take a cruise. Stay away till the dust settles. I could come with you. Two single ladies on the high seas. Hello, sailor. I am not going on a singles cruise, AnnaBeth. I've been single for one day. Just that some of 'em do Broadway shows. I could finally see Hairspray. Or you can move to another town. Change your name. Something like Lennon Breeland. Or Linden Breeland. I'm not leaving town just because I got dumped. I'm going to show this town that my happiness does not depend on George Tucker marrying me. I am a survivor. Me, too. Maybe we could survive  in one of those nice beach hotels in Bon Secour for a couple days. I'm gonna make my fresh start right here in BlueBell. First thing, I'm gonna get my own place. What? When? Brick : You're what? Lemon : Today. What? I'm already packed. I'll move into your bedroom. Lemon, no. Living on your own is like saying you've given up. It's one step away from letting your hair go gray and caring about animals. Lemon, you need your family around you right now. Let us take care of you. Daddy, you are missing the point. I don't need anyone to take care of me. I am Lemon Breeland, strong Southern Belle, and I will rise again. Without help. On my own. AnnaBeth. Yeah, oh, yeah. (Door opens) (Coughs) George. What are you doing here? Well, I was coming by to thank Lavon for all his help last night, but it's good to see you this fine morning, Miss Hart. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe thanking Lavon can wait just a second. I know I'm still just processing it all. What is there to process? I called off my wedding for you. That is what they call a grand romantic gesture. It was just all so sudden. That's what makes it grand. But, George, you have to admit, I mean, it's a little crazy. You just broke up with Lemon yesterday. All I know is that I chose you. And I want you. And I know you feel the same way. (Whistling) Well, fancy meeting you two here. Tucker, I thought you'd be on your, uh, honeymoon by now. See, if you wouldn't have flaked last night, you would've known that I called off the wedding. Right, sorry I missed that. I, uh, had my hands full. Mini muffin? Wade, mini muffin? George, mini muffin? Don't mind if I do. Yeah. And, uh, thanks again for last night, Doc. That, uh, house call totally cured my affliction. Good muffin. (Door opens) No. No, you got to be kidding me. I thought you were getting married. I know, but Wade? You and Wade? Wade and you? Stop saying that. Wade and Zoe. Zoe and Wade. It just happened. You got feelings for him? Okay, honest. Um, I'm not sure. Wow. I-I see. Okay. No, but, George, you know how I feel about you. None of this is what I expected to happen. I just, I need some time t-to think. Yeah, how long do you think that's gonna take? (Laughs) Just ballpark it for me. A week or a month or... You know, I just turned my life upside down for you, so if you're gonna run off with someone else, then I'd like to know as soon as possible. I know... Okay. All right. Wh... Lavon. Did I, uh, miss anything? Just be honest with them? You are the worst girlfriend in the whole world. Well, well, well. Alabama certainly has changed you. Yes, Lord. You are a walking country song, Dr. Hart. I should have told you about George calling off the wedding earlier. That was him at the door last night. Yeah. Is that's why you were so tired when you came back to bed? Well, why aren't you smiling? Figure you'd be happier than a dead pig in the sunshine now that Mr. Wonderful is single. Wade, stop. You're putting up walls. I get how you work by now. But you don't have to. Last night, you and I connected. I'm not just going to forget that. I told George that I needed time to think. Think about what? Oh. (Laughs) Ah, uh. Yup. You know, this happens sometimes. A woman will mistake finally having good s*x for a connection. Last night, something happened between us. Yeah, well, you had A-plus s*x for your first time. What do you mean I had A-plus s*x? You had it, too. Right? Yeah, for me it was more... B? B-minus. What? Sorry. B-minus? Good luck with Goldenboy. (Frustrated grunt) Babs : Well, it's a mite small,  but the location can't be beat. So, what do you think? I'll take it. Lemon, this place isn't for you? Oh, honey, don't you think you'd be better off resting at home, where you can be looked after? Babs, just give her the application please. Well, I suppose the choice is yours. Just have your father co-sign and we're all set. Oh, I don't need my father to co-sign. See, I'm an adult. I know that, honey, but you don't have any income. Or any prospects of getting any. Or even a credit score. Babs Foster, you have known me since I was in my mother's womb. You know that I am good for the rent. Yes, well, I know Brick is. You can bring the application by my office later. Hmm? Okay, well, now what? I'm going to get myself a job. Oh... Oh. Delma : And that's all I have to say about that. Oh, come on, Delma. No, you come on, Shula, face facts. George Tucker's had his eye on Zoe Hart since the day she came to this town. George Tucker is an upstanding man. He's gonna represent my cat in court. Lindsey Taub's... Uh, l-ladies? Ladies! Can you gossip while you clean? See-see, we got a bunch of debris over by the church, and in times like these, we need a clear path to the Lord. Amen, amen. All right. Listen, I've had enough of you. (Continues indistinctly) Ladies. (Chuckles) Now you see, it's people skills like that that make you such a good mayor. What's going on, Dash? Mayor Hayes, your reelection is coming up. And, uh, well, I would love to be your campaign manager. Yeah, I'd-I'd be honored, but, uh, since Lavon Hayes is running unopposed... Mayor Hayes, if you think you can just get by on your 98.7% popularity and football legacy, I'm here to tell you, this little scandal might just bring you down. Scandal? One word: Zoegate. Many of the voters believe that your little bestie is somehow behind the breakup. Oh. Oh, no, no. I'm sure BlueBellians are smarter than that, Dash. Come on, now. We shall see. I will not be treated by a home wrecker. With all that wax in there, I'm surprised you could hear the gossip. Don't look in my ears, home wrecker! Grandpa! Will you let the doctor do her job? Listen, it's-it's not personal, okay? He called Ms. Ulvestadt down at the bank a Norwegian spy. Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh, look at your adorable boots. I will not look at her boobs. I said "boots," Gramps. Oh. When you remove the wax, can you remove his tongue, too? Yeah, no problem. All right, she can look in my ears, but that's it. Only Dr. Breeland can deal with my lower half. Lucky him. I'm Ruby. Hey, I'm Dr. Zoe Hart. Yes, I've heard a lot about you today. None of it good, which makes me like you already. That makes me like you already. Why haven't we met before? I live in Atlanta. Uh, moved away the day I graduated. And for obvious reasons, I've never wanted to come back. Well, how have you angered the universe, that it would send you back now? Ow. I recently sold my cosmetics line and until I figure out my next step, I've been guilted into visiting family for a few days. Which basically consists of carting Gramps around and having people wonder what kind of mischief I got into in the big city. I have no idea what that's like. Of course. (Laughs) Sergeant, you are all set. Well, it's about time. Whoa. Yeah. Hey, I can hear. Well, Doctor. Good luck with all the home wrecking. Thank you. Guess Gramps and I are gonna get us some of that sludge that you call coffee at Agnes' bakery. You know, if you want to stay, I just got a new espresso maker. Well, yeah, fancy. No, no, no! If you want the home wrecker's brew, that's your problem. Can you please make mine a double, right now? Thanks. (Knock on door) Oh. Emily. Hello. Oh, what a nice surprise. Oh, come in. I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am about your daughter's wedding. Well, I know I'm family of the groom but, uh, I hope there's no hard feelings. Oh, no, of course not! No, it's-it's wonderful to see you. H-How much longer you gonna be staying around? Actually, I'm leaving town tomorrow. Oh. But... I was wondering if you might like to grab some dinner later. If you don't mind consorting with the enemy. Not that we'd be consorting. Whatever consorting actually even means. Well, dinner or consorting... Magnolia : Dad! Lemon already opened this stupid cake knife and I don't even know what to do. Magnolia, uh, this is, uh... There are like 800 gifts left to return before Lemon gets back and if they are still here, the steam might make her head pop off. I know, I know. I'll be right there, I promise. Okay. Emily, I'm so sorry. The timing is just terrible. Um, I'm going to have to pass on dinner. Of course. Good luck to you, Brick. It was so nice to meet you. My pleasure. Zoe : I know that my jerk neighbor does have feelings for me. But he shows it by calling me a B-minus in bed. Ew. I know, it's like not exactly mature. Right? And this other guy? Mmm. He left someone at the altar for me. But I don't even know how it would work between us. The town already blames me for the breakup, and this guy, he is this town, so, he would never ever leave. It's kind of an impossible situation. So what should I do? I think you need to look deep inside your soul and imagine yourself with both guys. Which one would make you happier? Finally. You know, someone who understands. Yeah. Who do you see? George Tucker. George, really? George Tucker. Hey. Sorry, didn't realize you'd be with somebody. I'll just wait, if that's all right. Hey, Ruby. Hey, G.T. How you doing? You know what? I actually better get going, too. I'm sure I'm way behind on apologizing for Gramps. No, wait, you can't go. I need you, okay? Could you maybe come over for dinner tonight? I live over at the mayor's. The mayor's? Mm-hmm. Well, I'd love to. Thank you. Good. Hi. Hey. Zoe, I just want to say that I'm sorry about this morning. I was jealous. And if you choose Wade, then so be it. It's my fault for waiting to tell you how I really felt about you, but I want you to know something. Lemon and I are over. For good. For... forever. You are? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. So choose me. Look, I'm not saying that it's gonna be easy, I'm not even saying that I know what's gonna happens next, but I do know this... Yesterday, when you told me you were staying in BlueBell... I suddenly felt the girl of my dreams right there within my reach and I had to reach. And I did. And I hurt Lemon and I did things yesterday that I... I never imagined that I would. But it was either that or risk spending the rest of my life wondering if I let the woman that I know I am meant to be with slip right through my fingers. (Knock on door) Dr. Hart? Brick. Hi. I should have known that somehow you would be involved in all this. Hold on, Brick, she didn't have anything to... And I don't want to hear another word out of you right now, Tucker. You have a patient. Look, Zoe. We can deal with all this, I promise you that. Choose me. Lemon Breeland? No. Is that you? Oh, dear God, no. Ruby Jeffries. I didn't know that you were in town. How are you? I'm so fine, fantastic, never been better. I heard about the breakup. I am so, so sorry. Let me tell you something. After my divorce, I realized that my marriage had been distracting me from all of my goals. And now, I can actually focus on what I really want. Now, Lemon, I mean, there had to have been something that you've wanted more in life other than just being a wife. Well... Lemon, you do have a plan B? Of course. But, see, I don't stop at B, I have so many plans they just run through the whole alphabet and start over... AA, BB, like the rows in a movie theater. So, no plan B, huh? I am currently looking for a job. It's all very exciting actually. My plan B is to be a career woman. (Laughing) What? I'm sorry. You did it. Bless your heart. I've been cursed with blinding ambition since the day I was born. Worked so hard I thought it might kill me. Of course, now I could basically retire to my own private island. And yet here you are in BlueBell. Lucky us. But, you... Have you ever even had a job, Lemon? I have been a Belle and the head of every Junior League committee for the past ten years. I've had tons of jobs. It's not a job if they don't pay you, dear. Well, I'm working hard at not slapping you silly right now. Does that count? Oh, Lemon, don't be so serious. I only teased you in high school because you were three grades younger and you were too big for your britches and you were named after a fruit. Oh, but just look at you. After all these years, you haven't changed a bit. Here. It's from my cosmetics line. New makeup makes everybody feel better. Go on. Ta-ta. 
 
 Wade : Here are your fries. You know, you should probably cut back on this stuff, Doc. You don't want to be weighed down when the George scandal breaks and the town's chasing after you with pitchforks. Wade, stop. Stop what? All of it. The glibness, the sarcasm, anything Wade-like, just stop. I put myself out there. I told you how I felt about last night. I know how George feels. So, for heaven's sake, why don't you just tell me how do you feel? I feel like we should keep on doing what we did last night. You know, you could use the practice, and it wasn't so bad for me. But like I told you before, I have no interest in going all John Wayne with George Tucker to be your boyfriend. Enjoy your fries. Oh, Lemonade, I was getting worried about you. Now I hate to bother you with this, but we cannot find the box for this cake knife that Shula Whitaker brought over. Are you okay? Of course I'm not okay. And it's your fault. Not George's? I mean, somehow I figured maybe it was just George's fault. It's your fault that I don't have a Plan B. I mean, why didn't you ever encourage me to be something other than a wife? I mean, why didn't you encourage me to be... I don't know, a doctor like yourself? Oh, you want to be a doctor? You are afraid of bodily fluids. I am 30 years old. And I've never even lived on my own. I went from this house to my sorority house, then back to this house. And, now, thanks to you, I don't have a job, which means I can't afford my own apartment, which means I'm going to live here until the day that I die? Which for the both of us, I hope comes soon! Lemon, calm down. Look, let me get you some sweet tea. I don't want your sweet tea! You know what, Daddy? I don't want one more second of you coddling me! You know what, I'll return that to Shula. Seems like a mindless, domestic errand. Right up my alley. (Exhales) (Phone line ringing) Emily, hey. It's Brick. (Chuckles) You know, upon reflection, I do believe my daughter is gonna need some space after all, and-and, you know, I was just wondering maybe, uh, are you still free tonight? Lavon : What's all this? Takeout from Fancy's. Could you get me some wine glasses? (Chuckles) What's the occasion? Wait, don't tell me you made your choice already? Oh, no. But I finally made a girlfriend, thank God. And she's coming over, so she will know what I should do. A girlfriend? Mm-hmm. Ha ha, good for you. And me. Mostly me. You can skedaddle. I don't need your advice anymore now that I have Ruby. She's only in town for a few days, so I need to milk her for all the girl talk I can. Did you say... Hey, Lavon. Ruby? (Screaming) Oh. Um... Ha. I take it you two know each other. Yeah, Lavon and I dated in high school. Yeah, hey. Hi, Ruby. No way. I'm gonna go change this, and then you two are going to tell me all about it. But super quick because then we're talking all about me. Would you like some wine? What's up, Tucker? Peace offering? This is, uh, obviously an awkward situation, but you and I have been buds for a long time, so I just want to say that no matter who Zoe chooses... You and I will be solid. Good. Good. I also just wanted to say that, um, actually, I have real strong feelings for her. So, I-I'm all in. All right. So, it's not exactly gonna be the easiest of competitions for you there. Hey, George. Think you want to come out here. Oh, good, you're home. Hi-ya! (Groans) What on earth are you doing? Defending myself. Aren't you here to kill me? No. You idiot. I'm here because, um, I can't breathe, and, um, okay, my chest hurts. And I'm having a heart attack. Okay, come sit down. Here, I'll get my medical bag. Do you want me to call your dad? No, I do not want you to call my father. I cannot stand one more minute of that man's coddling. Which is why I'm gonna spend my last moments on this earth with you, my sworn enemy, the woman about to run off with my fiance. (Gasps) (Panting) George : Okay, and you're sure  that you saw Lemon go into the carriage house? Yeah, that's a pretty unmistakable silhouette. (Chuckles) I'm sure she just wanted to chat with Zoe about something. They got a lot to talk about. Got to say, it's pretty interesting. (Phone rings) Yeah? George, it's Bill. Listen, Eugenia Todd tells me she saw Lemon walking through town, holding a knife. A knife? So, you might want to be on the lookout, just in case she's not going to slice a cake and you're her target. Right, um, Sheriff, you know what? You might just want to come on down to the mayor's plantation because Lemon and her knife are at Zoe Hart's place. Thanks. Whoo. Man. Things are getting more interesting by the minute. Ooh. You look wonderful. Success suits you. Likewise. Done really nice for yourself, too. I mean, who would have thought Lavon Hayes would move back to town, much less become the mayor. Life can take some unexpected turns. I mean, in high school, we both just wanted to get up out of here. And here we are. To unexpected turns. (Chuckles) Come on. Unexpected turns. We had a pretty great run there for a while, didn't we? We sure did. Yeah. All that entire summer before you left for 'Bama. Was magical. It was. (Laughs) I remember the last day we spent together like it was yesterday. So do I. We, uh, we drove to Gulf Shores, watched the sun come up. And you kissed me and told me we'd be together forever and that you'd call me as soon as you got settled into your dorm. Must have been so hard for you, being away from home for the very first time with absolutely no telephone access. Um... I'm sorry. Yeah, I got busy, you know, with football. Yeah, I waited for you for months. No one would even date me in my senior class 'cause everybody knew I was Lavon Hayes' girl. But I wasn't, was I? You had moved on. You just couldn't handle a difficult conversation. (Groans) Where is Zoe? How long does it take to change a shirt? You know, I should go check on her. Yeah. I'll be back in a bit. Seriously? (Sighs) Just tell Zoe I'll call her later. Okay. I'm not waiting any longer. I'm going in. Oh, there's a plan. Yeah, I'm sure the girl with the knife would love to talk with the guy who pushed her over the edge. Hey, you guys seen Zoe? She said she was gonna change her shirt. She never came back. She's entertaining. Lemon... who has a knife. A what now? I'm going over there. You are not. You are the last person Lemon needs to be seeing right now. What does Lavon have to do with all this? Interestinger and interestinger. It's not a heart attack. Take the Valium. No. I'm not having a panic attack. It-it is my heart. All right, it must be a latent condition. You are a terrible doctor. I'm telling you, Lemon, your vitals are stable. You are a healthy, 30-year-old woman with no history of heart disease. Given everything that's been going on, a panic attack isn't exactly a surprise. You ruined my life, so don't you dare feel sorry for me. I don't. Because you are just having a run-of-the-mill panic attack. Take the Valium. No. If I'm having a panic attack, that just means I'm the fragile mess that everybody thinks that I am, and I'm not a mess. (Sighs) Lemon, take the pill. I promise, it will make you feel better. No one will ever know. (Sirens wailing) Oh, thank goodness. Sheriff Bill, all right. Don't worry, guys. You're in good hands. Now, the most important thing is that we keep the situation contained. No one panic. (Radio chirps) Web search: kidnapping with a lethal weapon. Mechanical Voice : Searching the Web for... kidnapping with a lethal weapon. I'm glad you could come out tonight. It is good to get out. It's been a while for me. But delightful dinner companions don't come along all that often. Tom : Dr. Breeland? I spent a lot... Dr. Breeland? You know, Tom Long, this better be serious like the sudden onset of a flesh-eating virus or something. The sheriff's looking for you. Lemon took Zoe hostage. This'll just take one minute, maybe two. Uh, be right back. Did y'all hear that? It's BlueBell's first ever hostage crisis. Dash : Attention, Blawkerites, the whole town is gathered outside Zoe Hart's house in what has become BlueBell's first hostage crisis. I just called Lemon to ask for her list of demands. She's not answering. No worries. I got this. Sometimes you just got to ask yourself, "What would John McClane do?" Where is that air vent? Wade : Hey, hey, where you going? In. I'm worried. Look, I told you, you're only gonna make it worse, all right? I'll go in. No. You're not gonna go in there. This is my problem. See, it's your fault, not your problem. I'm going. Hey, Wade, hey, don't you dare. George, we don't have 15 years for you to make your move, all right, it's not what they need. Yeah, and I'm sure you know exactly what the two of them need right now. Trust me, brother, I know exactly what they need, or at least, that's one of them told me the other night right after round three, so... (Crowd yelling) Well, your pulse is back to normal. The panic attack is over. Great. I can go on living my stupid, miserable life. Come on, Lemon. You may be a snobby New Yorker with horrible fashion sense, but... I mean, at least you have a career. I've been with George Tucker for 15 years of my life, and I don't even know who I am without him. Never been single. Never been on my own. I'm as much a mess as they think I am. Lemon, I may have a career, but believe me, my life is just as much a mess as yours. The whole town thinks I'm a home wrecker. I only have one friend, and did I mention that I had s*x with Wade last night? No. (Screams) Did you just bite me? We're both going through major life changes right now. You maybe a little more than me. And that panic attack was your body telling you that today might not be the best day for big changes. We need to take our time. Baby steps. Sometimes, it's about baby steps. Baby steps. I'll walk you out. (Crowd yelling) This is so confusing. Why are these two fighting? Okay, I have a new theory. Lemon slept with Wade, and George, seeking revenge, slept with... Brick : Come on. Knock it off. Knock it off. This is not helping matters. Well, he started it! No, I finished it. Hey, hey, hey. There they are! (Crowd exclaiming) Oh, my God, they know! Everybody knows. We don't know what they know. Lemon Breeland, you are under arrest for kidnapping Dr. Hart with a deadly weapon. Okay. So they know that. Come out with your hands up! Sheriff Bill, this has been a big misunderstanding. Lemon didn't kidnap me. We were just hanging out. It's a kind of new thing, we're pals. But Le... But Lemon's got a knife. A wedding present I was all set to return to Shula Whitaker. And here she is, weirdly. Sheriff Bill : Oh, man. I was finally going to solve a real crime. All right. Go on back home, everybody. Go on back home. But now, now, now, Sheriff, we need some answers. Now, if Lemon did not try to kill Zoe because she had an affair with George Tucker, then why, why did George and Lemon break up? Was it Wade? No. It was actually all my... It was no one's... It was no one's fault. There was no one person responsible for the breakup. At the end of the day, it just... wasn't meant to be. All right, you two, shake and make up. Come on, now. Sheriff Bill : Good. Thank you. For saving my life. I mean, I still hate you, and I'll hate you until your dying day, but... listen, if you want to date George Tucker, then you don't have to hide it from me. I mean, don't consider this a blessing, it's just that... I have been through the worst public humiliation twice in two days. There is nothing that you, or George, or anyone can do that will break me. Are you okay? It has been a doozy of a night. But I'm okay. I'm relieved, actually. Because I finally know what I'm going to do. Hey. Thanks for meeting me here. Well, then, I take it you made your choice. George, I'm sorry. Wow... Wow. You are picking Wade. No. No, Wade... just helped me get through your wedding day. Apparently, that's it. I'm choosing no one. Why? Because, George, as much as I would love to ride off into the sunset with you, right now it's a recipe for disaster. Look, Zoe... I told you, I will never hurt you again. Maybe not intentionally. But you just got out of a 15-year relationship. That's half your life. You don't know who you are without Lemon. But I know how I feel about you, and I know that we can make this work. I've never been in a real relationship. You've never even dated. I'm thinking that you... you probably should. George, I can't be your rebound. All right, so... so you're asking me to... date other people? As crazy as that sounds, yeah. One day soon, the stars will align, and you will be single, and healed, and so will I. But what if it doesn't work like that? We have to hope that it will. (Sighs) ♪ ♪ Brick : Morning, sugar. (Sighs) You didn't come home last night. I stayed at AnnaBeth's. She doesn't coddle me. (Laughs) Well, unless I tell her to. I see. How are you? Determined. To get a job, to get out of your house, to move on with my life. Well, I would love to help. In any way I can. Thank you. But you've done enough. Lemon... You don't... Daddy... I love you. And I have to get out from under your wings, otherwise I'm just gonna suffocate in there. So, please... Let me. You know, Lemon... there's a job opening here, you want it. Lemon Breeland is not waitress material. No. No, she is not. But I reckon we'd be willing to give you a shot anyway. Lemon, it's a job. All right? It's dirty, you got to take crap from people all day long, but it's honest work. And what better way to show the town of BlueBell that you are willing to do whatever it takes to start over? Besides... it would give me such pleasure to boss you around for once. (Clears throat) May I take your request? "Order." Yeah. Well, we'll see about that. That's my girl. Lavon : Hey, Ruby. There you are. Hey. Uh... you mind? Sure. Look, Ruby, um... You know, in high school, you had me wrapped around your little finger. I mean, I was powerless around you. So I thought if I ever tried to break up with you, well, somehow you'd just talk me out of it. It was easier to avoid the subject. And avoid you. But yeah, that was an immature, cowardly move and I apologize. Apology accepted. (Laughs) Thank you. (Laughs) Oh... Well, then, uh... Can I buy you one drink, before you disappear for another decade or two? Well, Lavon, you'll actually have plenty of opportunities to buy me drinks. I've decided to stick around for a while. You... you staying? Yeah. Ah... Why? 'Cause I have a lot of time on my hands, and nothing would give me more pleasure than to mess with your mind. (Laughing) Kidding. (Forced laugh) My grandmama wants me to stay and help her out for a while. That's all. Bye. ♪ ♪ Hey. Thought you would've ridden off into the sunset by now. It's not going to work out with George. For now. I get it. Why settle for the four-cylinder when you've just ridden a V8? Right? I just hope I haven't ruined you for all men. I chose nobody, you ass. My hat wasn't even in the ring. Although... I suppose my pants could be. You've got to be kidding. No way. Look, I just figure, you know, you're single. You could take me up on that tutorial. Maybe get your grade up from the B-minus. I don't need a tutorial. Sure. I know what you're doing. But I am a strong and confident woman, Wade. And I know that, from the fact that I have had s*x with no less than four other men... none of whom complained... that I am great in bed. Great! Just like I am at everything else I do! I don't have anything to prove to you. You got that? This doesn't mean anything. You get that? I don't like you. Yeah, see, uh... I don't really care. Just admit that I'm not a B-minus. No... But I do know how you could make up a little extra credit. Stop talking.
