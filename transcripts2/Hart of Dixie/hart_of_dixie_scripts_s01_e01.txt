 See the New Yorker in the Chanel jacket that doesn't quite fit in? That's me, Doctor Zoe Hart. Yesterday, I took a cab to my job at one of Manhattan's best hospitals.  Today, I'm on a bus in the middle of nowhere.  But I guess my journey really began four years ago when I gave the commencement address at my medical school graduation. 
 The first time I held a scalpel, I was nine.  My publicist mother complained that I didn't thank her enough in my speech.  My dad and I snuck off and dissected...  But there was somebody in the crowd who liked it. 
 Dr. Hart? It was quite a speech. 
 Thank you. 
 My name is Dr. Harley Wilkes. I'm from BlueBell, Alabama. I have a small private practice there. It's great town with great people, and a great place for a young doctor to hone her craft. I'd like to offer you a job. 
 Thanks. That's really flattering. But I have a plan. After I finish my surgical residency, I'll do fellowship in thoracics. Then I'll go on to become a cardio-thoracic surgeon like my dad. Our last name's Hart, so it's predestined. Your offer is really sweet. Thanks, though. 
 Bye. 
 My mother never wanted me to be a surgeon. 
 Congratulations! 
 She thought the fluorescent lights would give me wrinkles. 
 I know you'll be happy following in your father's footsteps. Can't help but notice he didn't make it. I know that must be disappointing for you, but that's your father. Always thinking about himself. 
 He wanted to be here, but he couldn't get out of Germany. Some diplomat needed a pacemaker put in. 
 Is that Katie Couric? 
 Katie! 
 Despite Mom's support, I had it all. The most amazing boyfriend who got what it was like to be a surgeon, too. Best part was, we both were going to do our residencies in the hospital where my dad did his in the best city in the world... New York. My plan was on track. Well, it's four years later, and you know I wouldn't be sitting next to a guy who smells like fake cheese and chum if it had turned out like I hoped. 
 First, the man I loved dumped me. Because I liked talking about surgery more than I liked talking about his day. But my dad taught me that to be a great surgeon, you can't let feelings get in the way. So, I kept my pain inside. I could because I was a shoe-in for... What do you mean, I didn't get the cardio-thoracic fellowship? No one wanted this more than me. I already did a solo coronary bypass. Zoe, you've got the best hands I've seen in 30 years, but if you want to be a heart surgeon, then you got to work on your own. By I do cardio five days a week. You know what I'm taking about. Last week, you ignored Mr. Zucker when she asked you to read to her. But I'm surgeon, not a librarian. And Nicholas Sparks? Come on. This morning, when that guy came in with Horner's syndrome, I'm the only one who suspected aortic dissection. I saved his life. Yeah, but do you know his name? I need to be a cardio-thoracic surgeon. What do I need to I do to get next year's CT spot? You need to learn to see patients as people to help, not puzzles to solve, so if you want my recommendation next year, spend the next 12 months as a general practitioner. First of all, diarrhea and diaper rash? Ew. Second of all, I will never work in private practice without a specialty. There isn't a single GP job in this whole city. That may be true, Dr. Hart, but there are other places to practice medicine besides New York. ♪ ♪ (scoffs) Zoe :  Dad? No, I didn't get the fellowship. I know. Mom thinks it's, like, a sign that I should be a hand model or something. You still believe in me, though, right? I know, I just have to figure a few things out first, but then, look out. You're going to have a partner. Oh, I know it's not that easy. I... Okay. You go. I love you, Dad. (phone clicks, dial tone hums) Dad. ♪ ♪ I was lost. Every fellowship was taken. I had put all my eggs in the wrong basket. But then I saw it. Another postcard from that Southern guy, Harley. He'd been sending me them the last four years, ever since graduation. My speech really must have inspired him. "Tark Twins keep wrestling in poison oak. "Real busy. Could use an extra, extra-talented hand." (voicemail beeps) Dr. Wilkes, this is Zoe Hart leaving a message. You win. I'm on my way. DRIVER (over P.A.): BlueBell, Alabama. Last stop on the Gulf Coast. It wasn't New York. It really, wasn't New York. But I was going to figure out a way to make this work. First, I needed a cab. Can I offer you a ride, ma'am? Thank you, but I have a strong policy against strangers chopping me up into a million pieces. If it helps, I'm-I'm an attorney, not an axe murderer. (sighs) All right, just... just leave that there. I'll get it for you. Okay. Um, thank... thank you. No problem. So, let me guess. New Yorker? I lived in, uh, Tribeca for a while, when I worked at Cravath. As in Cravath, Swaine and Moore? Yup. What are you doing here? Take it you're not in town for the crawdads, huh? (laughs) Um, I've been exiled from Manhattan. This is my purgatory. Well, if, uh, you consider purgatory to be a place where neighbors take care of each other, and, uh, every third Tuesday demands a parade. And you can call it what you want, but I call it home. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) Thank you. No problem. I'm, uh, George Tucker. Zoe. Dr. Zoe Hart. Well, uh... Well, good luck, Dr. Zoe Hart. I hope you find what you're looking for. ♪ ♪ Hi. Hello? Is Dr. Wilkes around? What rock you been living under the last four months? Harley passed away. What? He just sent me a postcard. Are you Zoe Hart? Yeah. He told me if I kept sending you his postcards, eventually you'd show up. Guess he was right. Why would he want me to show up? 'Cause Harley left you his practice. (laughs quietly) Okay. It's beyond weird. Why me? Harley never really explained. Well, clearly, the man was one avocado short of a Cobb salad. But oddly, it works in my favor. This is the catch of the day? What were you expecting? Sous-vide grouper with a yuzu-mint gelée? It's a gulf. We got catfish. It's fried. Ugh. You... Hmm. Look, Chief says I have to spend a year as a GP, and I don't want to waste a day, so notify the town crier or whatever, and let him know I'm open for business. Oh, no, no. The thing is... See, technically, Harley only left you half the practice. And he shares it with Dr. Breeland. And Brick... he's been waiting a long time to get BlueBell all to himself. Okay, well, let's just find him. Tell him I'm here for only a year, and then he can be the big fish in the world's smallest pond. (laughs) No. Brick's hunting. And that ain't the sort of news you tell an Alabama man when he's got his hog rifle locked and loaded. Zoe : Whoa. ♪ ♪ Okay, someone needs to tell the people of this town that's it's 2011. ♪ ♪ Dancing in celebration of the Confederacy? Really? No. Dr. Hart, the Belles are elite young ladies chosen to keep our history alive. You mock all you want, but, actually, I wouldn't do it out loud, because, uh, they're meaner than they look. Zoe : The Belles? Mm-hmm. Emmeline, come on. Oh, you can call me Mrs. Hattenbarger. And my husband put the satellite in last year. We watched every episode of  The Sopranos,  and believe me, that family has got nothing on these girls. When I heard there was a new lady doctor in town, I painted myself quite a different picture, but you are just so pretty! Zoe, this is Lemon Breeland. Oh, okay. You're Brick's daughter? All right. Um, yeah, it's really nice to meet you. I'm dying to talk to your dad. I know he's hunting or whatever, but you must have a way to contact him? Oh. (laughs) Honey, there's no need for that. He knows that you're here. And if I were you, I'd be gone by the time that he returns, because Daddy can be quite... imposing. (laughs) Well, you tell  Daddy  that if my medical career hasn't been killed by my mother or the Chief of Surgery at New York Hospital, it most certainly won't be by some Southern xenophobe dressed up like a stick of butter. Well, you have a good day. (giggles) I'm gonna see some patients. Could you get me a venti soy latte so I don't fatigue? The nearest high-falutin' coffee place is 11 miles away. Thanks. That is so nice of you. (exhales) (phone ringing) Mom. Hi. Sorry I haven't been answering. No, actually, there's something I need to tell you. I moved to Alabama. Mom? Are you there? Is Dr. Breeland around? He's hunting. (phone rings) Uh... my mom. (nervous chuckle) Freaking out. I told her I moved here. What's up? You sick? Oh, I feel as good as anyone my age would. But there's been a little mix-up down at the DMV. Don't suppose you could sign this for me? Let me give you an eye test first. (phone ringing) (soft groan) Mom. Uh... E, F, P, T, O, Z... (continues reading chart) No, you know what happened with the fellowship. It's a GP position. ...P, E, C, F... Alabama, Mom. The state? E... No, I'm not having a nervous breakdown, okay? I... D, F, C, No, it's the TV. Good-bye. Z, P. All right. (sighs) Eh... Thank you very much. (clicks tongue) (chuckling) (door opens) Oh, my latte. Oh, yeah. Got thirsty on the way and drank it. You got a patient. Oh. I'm using subcuticular sutures. So there will barely be a scar. Well, it's not like I'm gonna catch a fella now. Hey, maybe you could give some dating tips to my daughter here. You know that thing about the potato chips, how you can't eat just one? Big Mabel feels that way about lunch, don't ya, honey? She's always been chubby, but she's put on a good half ton since that boyfriend of hers dumped her. You'Yo all set. Use the antibiotic cream twice a day. Mabel, those dark patches on your face, how long have you had those? Woman : I told her to use sunblock. Come on. No offense, but we'll be seeing Dr. Breeland from now on. You understand. Clearly, I needed someplace to live. Mrs. H. arranged for me to stay at the mayor's plantation. I was like, I'm not sleeping at some old confederate guy's house. But she said it was either that or the sidewalk. (doorbell ringing) So... No way! You're the mayor? Lavon Hayes, the linebacker? Two Super Bowls, five Pro Bowls. Four actually. Well, I rounded up. You got robbed in '06. Oh, Lavon Hayes likes your math. You must be Zoe. Yeah. Let me show you to your quarters. All right. I got it. Are you sure? Lavon Hayes will get your bags. Thank you. You know, you being the mayor here is the first thing about BlueBell that I actually like. Thank you. How'd that happen? Well, after ten years in the NFL, I was a little lost. So, Lavon Hayes moved back home. Having played for the Crimson Tide, I was quite popular around here. I ran, I won. (both laughing) Here it is. Let me get the door for you. Watch your step. Thanks. Well, sorry about the look of the place. I think you could put your bags in the back room there. Huh, it's not my loft in Soho, but I'll order some stuff from Barney's online. Make the place more homey. You share a generator with the guy in the gatehouse. Looks after the place... Wade Kinsella. If you've got your curling iron going while he's got his AC. on, could be trouble. Oh, if you do decided to wander, um, keep your eyes peeled for Burt Reynolds. All right. What? ♪ ♪ (loud music playing inside gatehouse) (woman laughing) Man : That sounds good. I'm crushing the solo, ain't I? Whoo! I'm killing it. You overheated the generator. Nice nightgown. I'm Wade. Well, that smile might make all the girls at the church social swoon, but it's not going to work on me. Well, if you're not going to be polite, I'm not going to show you where the fuse box is. Good night. All right, Wade. Wade : Keep going, ladies, come on. I'm just getting warmed up now. (gasps) (hissing) (screaming) (growling) Shh, shh, shh. George? Hey, hey, hey, hey, what? Alligator. What? An alligator! I'm sorry, I must have got some mud in my ear. An alligator. And alligator? Why didn't you say so? That is an emergency. Just stay, stay back. Beat it, Burt. (grumbling) That's Burt Reynolds, the mayor's pet alligator. His favorite movie's  Smokey and the Bandit,  so... That's funny. Yeah. All right. Oh, come on. Hey, hey. I know you're a New Yorker and everything, but down here in Alabama, when somebody interrupts their nightly jog to climb into the mud to save our well-toned ass, we, you know, we say thank you. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh. Well, thank you. I guess I'll be seeing you around. Yeah. See? Hey, small towns have their perks, huh? BlueBell isn't so horrible, Dad. The people here aren't so bad. Maybe I can make a difference. (call waiting tone) I have another call. Call me. Are you getting my messages? Bye. Hello. Did you sign Old Man Jackson's eye exam for the DMV today? Yeah. Why? 'Cause he just ran someone over. (sighs) Can't you tell a legally blind man when he's right in front of your face? All you had to do was open his file! Everybody knows Old Man Jackson memorized the eye chart. Oh, my God, I feel so bad. I was distracted. Well, you should be. He nearly killed George Tucker. If you wanted to see me again, you could have just asked. It's my shoulder. Just... All right. Ready? (groans) It's dislocated. It's no big deal. I just have to put it back into place. What the hell?! That's just the morphine. It's the easy part... baby. Eventually, you're going to find out this whole getting-run-over-by-a-car thing was kind of my fault. (loud snap) Ow! You did it again! Okay, have you never heard of bedside manner? Why is everyone so obsessed with that? Because it's nice! George? Good. Morphine's working. OMG, it's true. Rosie, honey, come on, it's time for bed. Aunt Emmeline, this is breaking news. Rose Hattenbarger, BlueBell beat blogger for the otherwise torpid official town Web site. So, how does it feel to be responsible for maiming George Tucker, town golden boy? He is not maimed. Off the record-- why would anyone ever leave New York? New York is everything, and I know. Read the  Daily Intel,  own all the  SATC  DVDs. I bet you're a Carrie. I'm a Charlotte, but I wish I was a Carrie. You guys really like your classic HBO, huh? But I am a Miranda who also wishes she was a Carrie. I knew you and I were going to be friends. Well, I guess I could use a friend. Damn straight. Brick's here. Hello, Pickle. Hi, Brick. Um, I'll see you later. We haven't met. I'm Dr. Zoe Hart. As far as I'm concerned, you're just the girl who almost killed two people and spoiled my hunting trip. How dare you see my patients. Well, technically, Harley left his half of the practice to me. Miss Hart, I'm not going to share this office... not for one minute. I see you have met my lawyer. When he's conscious, he doesn't lose. I'm going to be contesting the will. Harley wasn't in his right mind. You haven't even given me a chance. I believe I can do some good here. Well, bless your heart. But thingsave been working just fine here in BlueBell. We survived Katrina, we survived BP, by boarding up the windows and piling up the sandbags to keep the rot outside from fouling our community. And believe you me, Zoe Hart, we are going to chase you away from our waters. Zoe :  Well, my night had quickly gone downhill. But in times like this, I find one thing really helps me through. Wine! Tell me you have a nice dry chardonnay. Yup. Come on. You're Mabel, right? Bad day? You have no idea. Ugh. Oh, yes, I do. You met my mama? Oh, yeah. Yeah, my mom isn't exactly supportive, either. Mabel, I know it's none of my business, but the dark patches on your forehead and face... you have melasma. You know you're pregnant, right? I don't know that. I haven't taken a test. Well, I'm sure you can get one here over by the Slim Jims and duck calls. Long day. I didn't think... We only had s*x once. He told me he wouldn't do it if he had to wear a condom. I didn't want to lose him, but he left anyway. So, my mother's right. I'm stupid. Look, you need a doctor. Here. Take this. Can I have this? I'm gonna give you my number, and you can call me, and I won't tell anybody, okay? Okay, I'll take that. Hmm. Thank you. Owe you some money. Do you realize that my engagement party is tomorrow?! Huh? I mean, what am I supposed to do? The photographs! The press! The whole thing's just gonna be ruined! Seriously, Lemon, what are you blabbering about? Well, thanks to you, my fiancé was in a car accident. You're engaged to Old Man Jackson? No, you twit. I'm engaged to George Tucker. (sighs) Zoe :  Clearly, BlueBell wasn't the answer. I'd messed up as a doctor and gotten the guy I kind of liked run over. Oh, and it turns out he was engaged. 
 
 ♪ ♪ I had sunk to my lowest point. Well, maybe not my lowest. Nice first day. Everyone knows Old Man J memorized the eye chart. Don't you have some cows to tip, Wade? Oh. Look at you, girl. You're drunk as a boiled owl. I'd offer to give you a ride, but I don't want you getting any ideas. Zoe :  I was making out with the electricity-stealing buffoon from next door. But it gets worse. (grunts) (car horn plays "Dixie") (both panting) There it is. Rock bottom. Oh, my God. I just played "Dixie" with my butt. This never happened. You hear me? My lips are sealed, Doc. (sighs, muttering) Get me out. (door squeaks) Oh! Oh! Ow! (Zoe panting) (car doors closes) (car engine starts) ♪ ♪ Mom! What the hell are you thinking? I get that you feel you had no choice. What I don't understand is why this Harley would try so hard to get you down here. I mean, no offense. Your speech was great, but really, why? I'm not sure. It's possible he was nutballs. I don't care what the chief said. Nothing is worth you spending a year here. And your father agrees with me. Wait. You talked to Dad? Well, he called me after he heard your message that you left last night. How do you think I found you? Well, he called you instead of me? Um, you know him. He can't deal with complications. But, honey... do you belong here? Let's go home. Zoe :  She was right. I didn't belong in BlueBell. We made arrangements to leave at 5:00. I called George. That was awkward. He asked to meet me on the pier. Guess he wasn't dying to be seen with me in public. Can't say I blamed him. Glad to see you're feeling better. (sighs) Uh, I know you have your party to get to, but this is time-sensitive. I'm going back to New York this afternoon. Really? I'll take it that, uh, exile was lifted? Can I have the papers, uh, for, you know, signing over half the practice to Brick? Yeah, of course. I, uh... I heard about your run-in with Lemon last night, and I... I-I should have told you. What? That you're engaged? I mean, between the alligator and getting hit by a car, you kind of had a lot going on last night. Look, you should've known Lemon when we were younger. I mean, she's funny, she's irreverent. And I just was honored that she... that she chose me. But, uh, you know, after law school, I just... I needed, uh... change. You know, so I decided to move to New York, and I loved it in the city. But I woke up dreaming about the sunset, and, uh, having sand beneath my feet, and I realized that BlueBell, and, uh, Lemon... they're who I am. You know, can't really be my best self without them. Wow. You're a lucky guy. A girl you feel the same way about as a town. The papers? (sighs) Thanks. Uh, I'll mail them when I get back to New York. Okay. Good-bye, George Tucker. ♪ ♪ (phone ringing) Hello? (whispering): Dr. Hart? It's Mabel. I don't feel... well. But I'm-I'm working at the Breelands'. I can't leave. Can you come here, please? Mabel, I have a plane. If you're at the Breelands', why don't you just talk to Brick? Brick the dick? No way! You said you'd be my doctor if I needed you. Didn't you take an oath or something? (sighs) Zoe : I know I'm not invited, but I'm a doctor. This is a medical emergency. Silly, this is Brick Breeland's house. He is  the  doctor. Actually, she's here with me. Lavon Hayes. Mayor. Yeah. (chuckles) I do believe that entitles me to a plus one. Mm-hmm. ♪ ♪ Lavon : How you doing, ladies? Good to see you. Thank you. I gotta go find Mabel. Oh? Well, not a problem. This party could use a little shaking up. (chuckles) I do believe Lavon Hayes needs himself a cocktail. Look, I am sorry about the photographs. I know how hard you planned today and... Oh, honey, I don't care about the pictures. That much. (both chuckle) I don't know what's become of me. All the stress from the wedding has just turned me into a real... 'Bama beeotch. But... I love you. I really do. And nearly losing you last night just reminded me of how much. And I promise that I'm gonna try real hard to be the same old Lemon that you fell in love with, okay? Zoe : Oh! (clears throat) Uh, Zoe? Is everything okay? What are you doing here?! I came with the mayor. Lavon? Okay, well, uh, welcome. And the bar is over... that way. Thought you said she was leaving town. I thought she was. (groaning) Mabel? Thank you so much for coming. I'm having these bad pains. Oh, my God, there's another one. Okay. (groans) Oh, they're getting worse. Mabel, how long has it been exactly since your last period? Not sure. (groans) Another one? They're 15 seconds apart. Okay, Mabel, stay calm. Look, we're not gonna make it to the hospital. You're having a baby, and you're having it now. Come on. What is going on here? Brick, she's ten centimeters, ready to push. Contractions are on top of each other. We need to deliver this baby. No, I need to deliver this baby. Have Emmeline get me my medical bag, my drug box. Get me some towels. No, no, no, no, no, don't you come near me! Dr. Hart and I, we're in this together. She's  my doctor. Guess I'll be needing the towels. Okay, Mabel, Mabel, are you ready? I'm gonna need you to start pushing, okay? I'm gonna come check on you later. Make sure you're all right. All right. So, Mr. Mayor, is it true? You're here on a date with that, uh... Dr. Hart? (dry chuckle) How is that any of your business? I mean, if I do recall, we are at your engagement party. Lavon... come on. You know how difficult this is for me. Difficult never stopped me. You're doing great, okay? I see the head. Another contraction. I need you to push again on the count of three. One, two, three. Go, go. Push! Oh, no! (groaning) (panting) Brick, the shoulder. It's lodged in the pelvis. (groaning) Push her head back in, I mean... The ambulance is on the way. They'll have to do a C-section in Mobile. Isn't that 20 miles away? (moaning) All right. Mrs. H, I need you to hand me my scalpel. What are you doing? A symphysiotomy. No, I can't let you slice open her pelvis like that. It is way too dangerous. We have no choice, okay? This baby comes out now, or we lose both of them. (Mabel breathes hard, moans) Okay, Mabel? I'm going to give you a local to dull the pain, but I can't have you numb r when you need to push. You're going to feel a little pinch. Ready? Ahh! (whimpering) Now, I need you two to hold her steady until it's all over, no matter what. And after she delivers, I'm going to close her up as soon as possible. Brick, that means the baby's all you. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Zoe : Okay. Ready? Hang on, hang on. Come on. (screaming): I... ow, ow, no, please, please, it hurts too much! Losing way too much blood. (moans) Come on, Mabel. (crying weakly) Mabel, don't you pass out on me. Mabel, come on. I need you to push. Brick : Hey. Zoe : I know you're tired, and I know you're in pain, but I need you to be strong. Stronger than you've ever been in your entire life. You can do this. Now give me one big push. Here you go. Okay? (screaming, crying) ♪ ♪ (baby crying) Oh... Is she okay? Yeah. She got ten fingers and ten toes, and those lungs that would make Carrie Underwood jealous. Brick : You got yourself a healthy baby girl. (baby coos) (Mabel laughs quietly) Brick : Nice job. You know, it's too bad you're not going to be staying. George told me you were going to sign the practice back over. Well, I'll go tell the paramedics we're fine. Mabel, what you did for your daughter... you were amazing. Don't ever forget how much strength you have. A baby?! You have got to be kidding. I have a patient recovering here. Dr. Hart, it's okay. Look, Mama... I made a beautiful, perfect person. How she grows up, (sniffs) how she looks at herself, that's on me now. And I'm not gonna expose my baby to you. So, please... get out. Yeah... (door slams shut) (Mabel giggles) You ju... You just can't leave now. Thank you, Mrs. H. That means a lot, coming from you. I was happy I could help. It was nice. Great, actually. But I mean, come on. BlueBell? I don't fit in here. Everybody hates me. Plus the humidity is really ruining my hair. I'm not a family doctor. I'm gonna be a cardio-thoracic surgeon. I've known since I was nine. I just have to figure out another way. You asked me before why Harley left you his practice. I didn't tell you the whole truth. I didn't think it was my place. But... I've been carrying this around since, uh... since you got here. Didn't know if I should give it to you, but... Here. That's my mom. And... Harley? Yeah, Zoe. Harley Wilkes was your father. Wha...? You're here! Great! There's a superb Sancerre chilling in the car. We need to talk. Oh, my... Oh my God. Zoe, I can explain. What's there to explain? That my entire life has been a lie? This is the answer to everything, isn't it? Why Harley left me the practice, why Dad stopped loving me? Because I wasn't his to love. He knew, didn't he? When you were ten, you fell off the swings, they thought you would need a transfusion. But when he donated blood... He tried to stay in your life, but I guess it was too hard. That's why he left? And what about Harley? Why not tell me about him? Was he a psycho? A pedophile? What? He was a mistake. I met him on a cruise. It was Greece. He was handsome, older, a gentleman. It was a fantasy. But I was engaged. To someone real. Did you love him? It doesn't matter. I did not belong with him, just as my child does not belong in a place like this. I gave you a father who was from our world. I protected you. That should've been my choice. I am sorry, Zoe, okay? I am truly, deeply sorry. But, please, can we just go home and discuss this in therapy like normal people? You go. I'm staying here. (sighs) Zoe :  Growing up, I was told that to be a surgeon, I couldn't let myself feel. But then, I came to BlueBell. All the food here is fried. The whole town smells like mold. And clearly, the s*x education system is lacking. They could use a good doctor. One who cares about her patients. Maybe, even though you're gone, there are still some things you can teach me. (sighs) No one ever believed in me like you did. You kept sending me those postcards... knowing one day I'd be lost. (voice cracking): And maybe following in your... (sighs) my real father... your footsteps for a while, um, I might find my way. (sniffs) Thanks. ♪ ♪ (cell phone ringing) Hi. Zoe, where are you? I got the Tark Twins here again. Zoe : Let me guess. They were wrestling in poison oak? You got it. I'll be right there. See you soon, Dr. Hart.
