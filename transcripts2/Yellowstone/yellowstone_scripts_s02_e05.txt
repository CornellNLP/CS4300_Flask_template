 How'd you get out? 
 Don't catch that one. 
 Why not? 
 Don't want him caught. 
 That's the horse that killed my mother. 
 Why not put him down? 
 Or sell him? 
 You're applying logic to a situation where it isn't wanted. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 So, you're Daddy's new pet. 
 I ain't no one's pet. 
 Yeah, you are. 
 Been thinking about getting a pet of my own. 
 Yeah? 
 Have fun with it... 
 It's okay to watch me walk away, you know. 
 That's why we do it. 
 You're startin' to get some swish in them hips, young lady. 
 Eat sh1t, you f*cking redneck. 
 Little orphan boy fell in love today. 
 With the farmer's daughter. 
 Little. 
 Orphan. 
 Boy... 
 Little. 
 Orphan. 
 Boy. 
 Lovestruck little orphan boy... 
 Ahh! 
 Ahh! 
 Get him off me! 
 I'll cut you up, boy! 
 You had it coming. 
 Touch that boy again  and I'll gut you in your f*cking sleep. 
 Rip. 
 Go to the barn. 
 Go to bed. 
 Ah. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Why are you crying? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Asked you first. 
 I ain't playing games with you. 
 Why are you crying? 
 Just... 
 I get so mad sometimes... 
 And this is how it comes out. 
 Yeah, I do that, too. 
 Why are you mad? 
 I killed my family. 
 How? 
 By not being bigger. 
 I killed my mother. 
 How? 
 By being scared. 
 I don't do scared anymore. 
 You'll be plenty big some day, I'm sure. 
 Kiss me. 
 What for? 
 It'll make us feel better. 
 I don't know how. 
 Me neither. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Just watching. 
 - Why the scowl? 
 - No scowl. 
 I do things sometimes... 
 How do I explain it... 
 I see things in people,  and I feel like if I can touch it... 
 even if the rest of the person is rotten,  I can take that good thing and I can make it part of me. 
 Do you understand? 
 There's plenty of good in you, Beth. 
 And none in that son of a bitch. 
 Trust me. 
 I'm sorry, Rip. 
 I'm sorry I did that to you. 
 You didn't do it to me. 
 But woman, you sure can. 
 Anytime you want. 
 And "I'm sorry" is two words you never have to say to me. 
 Now I'm gonna ride off into the sunset. 
 That's the sunrise. 
 sh1t. 
 You know what I mean. 
 Even your walk is angry, sweetheart. 
 With good reason. 
 I'm gonna check the airfield in Deer Lodge. 
 But I'm starting to think that plane's from another state. 
 Yeah if I can get a warrant,  I can check flight logs out of air traffic control in Bozeman. 
 It'll be a a lot of data to sift through, but... 
 I thought we're not supposed to talk about work  at the dinner table. 
 In the morning, it's the breakfast table, Beth. 
 We can talk business at the breakfast table. 
 This is not a breakfast table. 
 This is a dining room table. 
 How do I know it's a dining room table? 
 Because it's in the f*cking dining room. 
 Breakfast tables are in the kitchen. 
 We don't even have one there... 
 we have a bar in the kitchen. 
 So, I guess the point is, Dad,  that you can discuss whatever you want at the dinner table,  it's just us who have to navigate the algorithm  of ways in which you control what's discussed. 
 Honey, I don't even know what the f*ck that means. 
 This is what it means, Dad. 
 Stop wasting your time, son. 
 Just go to the source, all right? 
 I want him to know what we know. 
 You think that's a good idea? 
 If I didn't think it was a good idea,  I wouldn't have suggested it. 
 Wear your badge today, Kayce. 
 Take Ryan with you. 
 Keep it official. 
 _  You. 
 You've lost the right to question me for a while. 
 Breakfast bar. 
 Why don't you say: "Dad,  I need to talk to you about something."  Why do you have to take a giant wrecking ball  to every meal before we have the conversation  you wanted to have in the first place? 
 It's important that you understand my passion for the subject  before the subject is introduced. 
 I think I understand it, honey. 
 So what is it you want me to say, hm? 
 Floor is yours. 
 What'd I do this time? 
 Why is Rip living in the bunkhouse  and cleaning out horse stalls? 
 He's a grown man. 
 They're all grown men, honey. 
 He's living in the bunkhouse  because the ranch foreman doesn't. 
 Kayce's ranch foreman. 
 He gets the foreman's house. 
 So why isn't he sleeping in the bedroom in this f*cking house? 
 He doesn't want to stay here. 
 Rip living in the bunkhouse is an obstacle you can overcome. 
 If that's what you choose to do, Beth. 
 Don't you dare make this about me. 
 He looks at you like a father. 
 But I'm not his father, honey. 
 I'm Kayce's father. 
 And Rip's not being punished. 
 All right? 
 I'm making a shift. 
 He's making a sacrifice. 
 How that works out. 
 How I reward that is... 
 is how I see it settled. 
 I hope that's enough for you. 
 It's always enough for me. 
 Okay, honey. 
 Go ruin someone else's day. 
 That's the plan, Daddy. 
 Becoming a man requires bravery. 
 Witnessed by others. 
 Not just words. 
 Actions. 
 Five achievements, or coups, to prove your worth. 
 Touching your enemy,  taking your enemy's weapons,  taking your enemy's horse,  leading a successful war party. 
 And jumping from one horse to another... 
 This is what the Indian Relay pays homage to... 
 Our actions speaking louder than words... 
 That exchange is everything. 
 It signifies getting knocked off your horse in battle,  but continuing on and never giving up. 
 To be a great leader, comes from atop a horse. 
 The horse reveals who you are. 
 What's this have to do with Christopher Columbus? 
 Absolutely nothing. 
 But look at all you learned. 
 Any other questions? 
 We pulled the stops out for ya. 
 Made it look like the real deal. 
 But practice is just a taste. 
 Gotta come to Sheridan in a few weeks  if you really want to feel it. 
 I doubt the university  is gonna let me take the class to Wyoming. 
 I didn't invite the class. 
 Ho. 
 Woo. 
 Whoa. 
 Yeah. 
 Goddamn, that horse can slide like a m*therf*cker. 
 I tell ya, if the world was flat,  he'd slide right off it. 
 If he can stop like that when Travis comes,  you'll be in the money. 
 Don't worry about that, I'll be in the money. 
 Hey, can I ask you something? 
 Is there any extra work I could do around here? 
 Just gotta make some money. 
 You can do all the extra work you want around here, Jimmy,  but you ain't gonna get paid for it. 
 You're on salary. 
 So there's nothing I can do? 
 When a cowboy needs extra money, he wins it. 
 Wins it how? 
 Bronc riding, roping,  bulldogging, cutting. 
 All the sh1t we do every day. 
 But you can barely do it as it is,  that ain't gonna win no money at it. 
 Yeah, so both of them came from the barn. 
 Did the sheriff's deputies confirm  the boy's weapon was loaded? 
 Yes, weapon was loaded. 
 And the weapon was pointed at Kayce  or the other agent? 
 No, Kayce first, then the officer. 
 - Isn't that right? 
 - Hmm? 
 Care to join the meeting? 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry I'm... yes. 
 Sorry, so the boy was... 
 he pointed the shotgun at Kayce,  and then the livestock agent. 
 What does it say in the report? 
 Sheriff doesn't specify in the report. 
 Dirty son of a bitch. 
 Just answer it, son. 
 - Sorry, yes. 
 Apologies. 
 - Jesus. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Finally. 
 Jamie, avoiding me  won't prevent the article from coming out. 
 You know, I'm not avoiding you... 
 I'm just... 
 Things are different now. 
 Nothing's different, Jamie. 
 I need to verify some of your statement  before I talk to your father. 
 My father. 
 Yeah, I have to give him an opportunity to respond. 
 Sarah, I'm begging you. 
 I pulled out of the race. 
 I... 
 I'm rescinding my permission to be quoted. 
 Yeah, doesn't work like that. 
 It does now. 
 I need you to confirm a few things... 
 I'm not confirming anything. 
 If you quote me once or refer to me in any way,  I will f*cking sue you into oblivion. 
 Yeah? 
 Fine, Jamie. 
 I'll have Legal call  and walk you through your lack of options. 
 It looks to me like the sheriff's report  is intentionally vague,  to give a sense your agents didn't follow procedure. 
 The real issue is their failure to respond. 
 Once it's official and I'm sworn in,  this will be the first thing I dig into. 
 No, the general election is all Haskell's thinking about. 
 This will go away long before then. 
 Thank you, Cassidy. 
 Anything else? 
 What? 
 I'm just having a moment of sorts. 
 Should I be worried about what happens next? 
 No, this one's... 
 It's more philosophical in nature. 
 You ever wonder what this place looked like  before any of us were here? 
 All the time, honey. 
 All the time. 
 When you fire a pistol, you aren't aiming. 
 - You point. 
 - Okay. 
 It's sense memory. 
 Repetition. 
 Yeah. 
 Hold your hands up, like a boxer. 
 Get your feet in a fighting stance. 
 Like this? 
 I need you to trust me. 
 Okay. 
 Put your feet together. 
 Now let yourself fall toward me. 
 - What? 
 - Fall towards me. 
 - You're gonna catch me? 
 - I won't have to, but yes. 
 Make fists. 
 Now throw a punch in the air, but don't bring it back. 
 Open your hand. 
 Extend your other hand. 
 - Keep both eyes open. 
 - Yep. 
 Focus on the front sight. 
 Cover your target with it. 
 Now fire. 
 Again. 
 I feel like a god. 
 Whoever holds the gun is god. 
 Until they pull the trigger. 
 Then you're the devil. 
 Can I help you? 
 Mr. 
 Jenkins. 
 Hello. 
 Gun, gun! 
 Put it down! 
 Put it down! 
 Listen to me! 
 Listen to me. 
 I will shoot you in the f*cking face  if you don't drop the weapon! 
 I'm a god. 
 Pull the trigger and you're the devil. 
 I'm already the devil. 
 Jesus. 
 What the f*ck are we doing? 
 We're not doing anything. 
 Stay here. 
 I saw lots of pictures of family... 
 but no family. 
 I sent them away. 
 Why'd you do that? 
 So you wouldn't kill them. 
 How you doing? 
 Can I help you? 
 You Mr. 
 Jenkins? 
 I'm with Big Sky Roofing. 
 Got a leak, huh? 
 Yeah, just, umm... 
 give me a minute. 
 Hey! 
 No, no, no... 
 Toss the pistol over. 
 Do it. 
 Now the radio. 
 Got cuffs? 
 You know the drill. 
 I'm a f*cking law enforcement agent. 
 You're not the only one. 
 Doing a little moonlighting, are we? 
 Alimony's a bitch. 
 Get up. 
 - Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 - Get in. 
 Asshole! 
 f*ck you. 
 Nobody wants to f*cking kill you. 
 We just want to live our lives the way we've been living  for the last hundred years. 
 And you keep coming here and trying to take that away from us,  and we just want you to f*cking stop. 
 Thought I made that clear. 
 Guess I was wrong. 
 You made it clear. 
 You hung me from a f*cking rope. 
 And now you sit on my porch  and you f*cking threaten me? 
 Again?! 
 What the f*ck do you want?! 
 What do you want? 
 What warrants you being in my f*cking house! 
 You killed our cattle. 
 I did what? 
 I don't know how to kill cattle. 
 You stupid f*cking redneck. 
 I'll tell you what I do know how to do. 
 I know how to crush empires. 
 And I will crush your father's. 
 Thank you for showing me the rules that you play by. 
 I look forward to the challenge. 
 What a f*cked situation this is. 
 Forgot to ask me for my keys. 
 I guess I'll be the only grown-up in the room. 
 Kayce! 
 You're going to tell me the truth  right f*cking now, you prick. 
 Now! 
 I don't know how to kill cows. 
 I wish I did. 
 When I see the pain it's caused you and your family. 
 I wish it had been me. 
 My guess is you're from a California office. 
 I'd go back to it if I were you. 
 Make me. 
 Rules are different around here. 
 I know these rules. 
 Yeah. 
 We'll see. 
 Wasn't Jenkins. 
 It had to be. 
 No, I looked him in the eye. 
 It wasn't him. 
 - What happened? 
 - It's fine. 
 No, I mean you, you don't look fine. 
 Didn't say I was fine. 
 I was just saying it went fine. 
 You know, sometimes I look at you, and I... 
 I don't recognize the man looking back at me. 
 What happened to you over there, son? 
 I don't like to talk about it. 
 I notice you don't, either. 
 I never talked about it 'cuz I never saw the point. 
 We might be more alike than you wanna admit. 
 You wanna hear a war story? 
 Yeah. 
 If it helps explain the man looking at me,  then yes, I do, son. 
 We were in Pakistan. 
 Weren't supposed to be there, but that's where we were. 
 We're hitting a high value target. 
 We blew the door off his house,  making our way down the hallway,  and this piece of sh1t moves out of his bedroom,  using his wife as a shield... 
 and he's got 8-year-old daughter on a leash, in front of him. 
 And he's holding an AK-47 over their heads,  and starts sending rounds at us. 
 And everybody froze because his family... 
 until it got my weapons sergeant and my medic killed. 
 So, I had a decision to make... 
 and in a tenth-of-a-second I made it. 
 I killed him and his wife and that little girl. 
 Soldiers don't tell war stories anymore, Dad. 
 'Cause wars these days... 
 it's just about trying to live through 'em. 
 First down, three wide receivers... 
 Left side, Roberts, back... 
 Plenty of time to get downfield... 
 and wide open... 
 Ahh... 
 _  _  County Sheriff's Department failed...  to provide back up to the livestock agents involved,  increasing the likelihood of a violent response  from the suspect. 
 Though our investigation is preliminary,  the shooting was justifiable  and the only action  available to the livestock agent,  whose life was clearly in danger. 
 Now currently we are conducting  an exhaustive internal investigation  into the procedures of our dispatchers  and the reaction time of our deputies  and I would like to express our sincerest apologies  to the Montana Livestock Agent involved  as well as the agency as a whole  for our failure to respond,  aggravating the dangers that those agents faced. 
 Go ahead. 
 Jesus, how'd you get him to say that? 
 I didn't. 
 I think you just run down and say 'whoa.'  I'm afraid there might be a little more to it than that. 
 Wait, you know how to do it? 
 Well, I ain't gonna win no money at it, but... 
 I don't think you are either. 
 I'm a little thin on options. 
 Look, just run down the arena,  point your belt buckle to the sky. 
 Keep your eyes on the top of the barn. 
 Open up your feet and say 'whoa.'  How fast do I need need to go? 
 Faster you go, the farther you gonna stop. 
 - Okay. 
 - You got it. 
 It's easy. 
 Easy. 
 - Easy... 
 - Mm-hm. 
 Whoa. 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 Ow!! 
 - Jesus! 
 - You all right? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Whew! 
 Belt buckle to the sky. 
 Belt buckle to the sky... 
 Whoa! 
 There you go! 
 Woo! 
 Ha! 
 I think I can do this. 
 - Did you see that? 
 - Oh, yeah, Jimmy. 
 We saw you out there looking just like Andrea Fappani. 
 Who? 
 - There you go. 
 - Whoa. 
 Woo! 
 Hey, Colby, how long is that? 
 Twenty-five. 
 - Twenty-five, huh? 
 - Yeah. 
 Goddamn, you bring the sharks when you come here, gramps. 
 What are you talking about? 
 That's just a God-fearing family  from north Texas, man. 
 - All right, well f*ck it. 
 - Want me to hold your beer? 
 Nope, beer's going with you. 
 All right. 
 
 
 
 Whoa. 
 Yeah? 
 Even with a beer in my hand, too. 
 See? 
 - Ah, that's not gonna get it done. 
 - I need you to scotch. 
 Not gonna happen, buddy. 
 Whoa. 
 Whew. 
 Money, money, money, money, money. 
 - Go on, man. 
 - All right. 
 Looking like a long 30, Colby. 
 - Yeah, thirty one. 
 - Thirty one... 
 Thirty one, huh? 
 - Twelve. 
 - Oh, sh1t. 
 I'd say that's the winner right there. 
 Jimmy, come here. 
 Listen, I've been watching these guys. 
 I don't know if you can choose who you run against... 
 but don't go against him. 
 And whatever you do, don't go against him. 
 You saw him slide this morning. 
 I feel kinda lucky. 
 You didn't see what I saw. 
 Oh, the kid's f*cked, dude. 
 Like a tied goat. 
 Hey, who's this kid on the f*ckin' aardvark. 
 It's a big mistake looking for a place to happen. 
 I don't wanna take money off a wrangler. 
 Listen, if he's dumb enough to play in this game,  you should take every cent from him. 
 You sure? 
 Travis, teach the son of a bitch a lesson, will ya please? 
 Alright... 
 Hey. 
 You. 
 What's your name? 
 Jim. 
 Jim? 
 Alright, Jimmy. 
 Come over here and let me explain the rules. 
 Wish me luck. 
 You're gonna need more than luck. 
 - You know what a pay-up is? 
 - Remind me? 
 So it kinda works like this,  if you come in last, you have to pay everybody ahead of you. 
 Come in second-to-last,  you're gonna pay everybody but the bottom. 
 Come in fourth, you pay the top three. 
 Come in third you pay the top two. 
 Like that. 
 All right? 
 You're new guy, you get the first horse. 
 You go first. 
 Run back there, slide back this way. 
 - Other way. 
 - Other way. 
 That other... 
 other way. 
 He's in trouble. 
 There you go. 
 You guys running a special needs program at your ranch now? 
 Is that what this is? 
 Is this your janitor? 
 - Who is this f*cking kid? 
 - That's good, Jimmy. 
 Send him! 
 - Here comes the go. 
 - I'd take the horse, not the rider. 
 Here he comes. 
 Oh, God. 
 - Uh-oh. 
 - Oh, God. 
 - Hit the brakes. 
 - Whoa. 
 - Talking about three feet? 
 - About three, four feet. 
 I don't think you'll have to measure that one, Colby. 
 That's... 
 I don't know if that's gonna get it, Jimmy. 
 I don't know. 
 Tom, go, go, come on. 
 Whoa. 
 Ah, I think you'll have to pay him, Jimmy. 
 That's one. 
 Hey, Mac, you wanna go? 
 This kid's a f*ckin' rookie. 
 You want me to take it easy on him? 
 No, I want you to smoke his ass. 
 He wants to play, let's play. 
 - If you can smoke him, smoke him. 
 - All right. 
 - All right, hold my beer. 
 - I got you. 
 Whoa. 
 Pretty big stop. 
 Looks like you're paying two. 
 Hey, Cade, wanna have a go? 
 That's three. 
 How old is that kid? 
 - How old's Cade now, is he 18, Mandy? 
 - Yup. 
 Good job. 
 Rip? 
 Can the mom ride? 
 Travis, can you please answer that for me? 
 Uh, let's find out. 
 Hey, Mandy, you wanna go? 
 - Sure. 
 - How much money has she won? 
 How much money has she won, um... 
 Oh, Mom is worth about two million dollars. 
 - Think she can ride. 
 - Two million and twenty. 
 After this. 
 Uh-oh, he's looking angry. 
 - Woo. 
 - Ha ha. 
 Ah, yeah. 
 I guess Mom can ride. 
 Well, Jimmy, congratulations. 
 You just got smoked by the whole family. 
 Don't worry, Jimmy,  it'll all be over soon. 
 I promise. 
 Where are these f*cking people from? 
 They're form North Texas, Jimmy. 
 Whoa. 
 Attaboy. 
 sh1t. 
 There you go. 
 That's all right. 
 I can't play this game. 
 I don't have enough horse. 
 Well, let's trade horses. 
 You take mine. 
 I got my stirrups set a certain way. 
 Oh, I won't change your stirrups. 
 He's gonna go broke. 
 Ah, that's smooth gait. 
 - Looks good, buddy. 
 - Aw, man. 
 Oughta be showing this f*cking thing  at Mule Days at Bishop. 
 This horse doesn't like me. 
 Yup. 
 Wait, Jimmy, I'm gonna make it fair, all right? 
 No, he's not really doing it. 
 Hey, someone better make sure the gate's closed. 
 Whoa. 
 Ain't the horse, kid. 
 All right. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Jimmy, get off the horse  before you hurt yourself, the horse, or both. 
 Look, I don't have a f*cking choice here. 
 Yeah, you got a choice. 
 Get off the horse. 
 Do what Lloyd said, get off the horse. 
 Go on. 
 Don't worry, I ain't gonna take your money. 
 Naw, you'll pay him. 
 Come here, Jimmy. 
 I hope you learned a lesson today. 
 - I don't see a lesson. 
 - Well... 
 There's sharks and minnows in this world, Jimmy. 
 If you don't know which one you are,  then you ain't a f*cking shark. 
 Now, go pay Travis. 
 My wallet's in my bag. 
 Go get it. 
 I don't want that kid's money, man. 
 He's gonna pay you. 
 All right? 
 Race you to the beer, loser pays twenty. 
 - I'll take your money. 
 - Come on, you son of a bitch. 
 Whoa. 
 I can hear you breathing. 
 Um... 
 I have a really big problem. 
 And I could use some advice. 
 Oh, my God, you're pregnant. 
 - This is f*cking serious. 
 - Yeah. 
 I'm in... 
 I'm in... 
 I'm... 
 I've painted myself in a corner,  and I can't... 
 I can't get out. 
 I can't get us out of it. 
 What did you do? 
 He kicked me out of the house. 
 He abandoned my campaign... 
 I was angry. 
 And I was in a corner. 
 What corner? 
 A reporter, this journalist... 
 she pretended to be... 
 And then she was on my campaign staff... 
 What the f*ck did you do, Jamie? 
 I gave an interview. 
 About what? 
 Not what... 
 Who. 
 You selfish piece of sh1t. 
 No, wait. 
 Wait. 
 Beth. 
 Wait. 
 I said wait. 
 I said wait! 
 You tell him. 
 Tell him, you motherfuck, you tell him! 
 You tell him! 
 I think I can take it from here, Beth. 
 What do you have to tell me? 
 What did you do this time... 
 Tell him, you motherfucking mutt! 
 Beth! 
 I can take it from here. 
 Go wait outside. 
 Don't you let him "Jamie" his way out of this. 
 Okay, Dad,  once he tells you, you come find me  so I can make sure he told you the truth. 
 For a woman who has mastered the art of mad,  I can't say I've ever seen her that angry. 
 So tell me, Jamie... 
 what did you do to scare the only person  I know who doesn't get scared? 
 What the f*ck did you do to me?
