 [chatter over PA] 
 - Funny. 
 I don't remember authorizing your release. 
 - That's because I didn't ask. 
 - You know, just because you feel like ready to leave  doesn't mean you are. 
 - That's exactly what it means. 
 - You know, I can have you restrained. 
 Just let me look at the sutures. 
 Come on. 
 - [sighs] 
 - Have a seat. 
 You can put that on the bed. 
 - No, I can't  I did my best to straighten the incision... 
 Looks like your vet used a bread knife. 
 Well, it's healing... 
 Those should come out in a few days  and then you'll be free  to terrify small children at the rec center's pool. 
 - Yeah. 
 [laughs] 
 - Not a joke. 
 I want you swimming twice a week. 
 With an instructor... 
 - I know how to swim. 
 - You don't know how to swim to rehab this. 
 My office will put you in touch with a physical therapist. 
 You're in this situation because you ignored your doctor. 
 He saw a mass on your CT scan,  he said schedule an appointment, and you didn't. 
 And so now you've had major surgery  for what a pill could've fixed. 
 When's the last time you saw a dermatologist... 
 - Oh, for f*ck's sake, Keith. 
 Thank you. 
 [groans] 
 - You alright? 
 - Yeah. 
 Just hurts to sit. 
 - Sorry. 
 Didn't see that one. 
 - Jesus, son. 
 Are you aiming for them?? 
 - If you know a smoother way back,  you let me know and I'll take it! 
 - Just, pull over right here. 
 - Maybe it's a little soon to come home. 
 - Yeah, well, I could say the same to you. 
 - What's that mean? 
 - It means, you don't fight, Kayce. 
 Understand me? 
 If wranglers get worked over, then wranglers handle it. 
 - How am I supposed to sleep in the same room  with men I won't defend? 
 - You aren't. 
 I'm gonna fix that problem, too. 
 - What, you walking home now? 
 I don't even know whose field this is. 
 - Me neither. 
 Ten years ago I did. 
 I think I finally understand you, son. 
 - Yeah, well if you wanna to explain me to me,  I'm all ears. 
 - You know, there's being scared to die, son,  and knowing it's coming. 
 When you know it's coming,  Tomorrow stops factoring into your decisions,  because you know you're never gonna see it. 
 Then you... 
 Then you live. 
 And you realize you ain't dead, and you're not gonna die. 
 And now you gotta face all of them decisions you made. 
 And out of all that, you gotta figure out  how to let yourself living again. 
 - I don't know how to do that. 
 - Yeah. 
 sh1t, I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 But we'll figure it out. 
 [theme music] 
 - This is how many acres? 
 - 324. 
 Listing price is 4.9. 
 - How motivated are the sellers? 
 - Well, they tried to spend the winter here. 
 - All right. 
 Offer 3.5. 
 No escrow. 
 Cash. 
 Seven day close. 
 Don't you want to see it first? 
 I'm seeing it now. 
 - Okay... 
 I'll head to the office and write up the offer... 
 Actually, let me show you one more. 
 - Now, this one isn't on the market-  But I know the property well, and I think... 
 - Then why are you showing it to me? 
 - You said every large property in the county... 
 - For sale. 
 - It's called the Pelican Ranch  - Why is it called the Pelican Ranch? 
 - Maybe they saw a goose and thought it was a pelican,  who the f*ck knows. 
 It's 1,100 acres-  - What's with the wit? 
 Doing some fast math on your commission  make you a little cocky? 
 Feeling good? 
 Showing us properties that aren't for sale? 
 Boy, you're on a tear. 
 You might even go home and lay some pipe to the old lady. 
 Look at you, with your your capped teeth and spray tan. 
 Get out of my office. 
 - I don't... 
 What... 
 - Get the f*ck out of my office. 
 Go write up the offer. 
 When it's done, email it,  so I don't have to look at you again. 
 And when you get your commission,  I want you to shove it up your waxed ass,  you cheesy m*therf*cker. 
 f*ck, I hate real estate agents. 
 Got your checkbook handy, Bobby? 
 Let's take this party on the road. 
 - You the teacher's aide? 
 - No, I'm the teacher. 
 - I saw this video on Pornhub  and this is exactly how it starts. 
 [laughter] 
 - Misogyny. 
 How refreshing. 
 If you can work in a Pocahontas joke  you'll hit the trifecta. 
 - Now that you mention it... 
 - What's your name? 
 - Trent. 
 - Can you tell me the definition of power, Trent? 
 Hmm? 
 It's the ability to direct or influence  another's behavior or a course of events. 
 That's what I have... 
 I can remove you from this class and fail you. 
 I can send you before the dean for violating  the student code of conduct. 
 These are all things that can alter the course of your life. 
 That's power. 
 And you don't have any. 
 [class chuckles] 
 When Christopher Columbus first came in contact  with Native Americans,  it was the Arawak people in the Bahamas. 
 I'll read to you from Columbus's journal:  "They willingly traded us everything they owned..."  They do not bear arms, and do not know them,  for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge  and cut themselves out of ignorance. 
 They will make fine slaves... 
 With fifty men we could subjugate them all  "and make them do whatever we want."  You ever feel like that, Trent? 
 Ever feel like making someone do you want,  whether they want to or not? 
 It's a very European mentality,  stemming from the oppressive political  and religious structures of the Renaissance. 
 Kings and priests with absolute power  ruling masses who have none. 
 That was the mentality of the men who discovered America. 
 And it is the mentality our society struggles with today... 
 What you know of history is a dominant culture's  justification for its actions. 
 And I don't teach that. 
 I'll teach you what happened. 
 To my people. 
 And to yours. 
 Because we are all the descendants of the subjugated. 
 Every one of us. 
 You did well. 
 Were you nervous? 
 - Terrified. 
 - [laughs] 
 So, um, that's new? 
 What happened? 
 - I fell down. 
 - Excuse me, Miss, um... 
 - Long. 
 - Miss Long. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I wasn't... 
 I didn't mean to... 
 I was just... 
 - I know what you were doing. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Insult me or anyone else in my class  and you're out. 
 Apology accepted. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Day one and you're already winning hearts and minds. 
 - That mind is far from won. 
 - But it's not lost either. 
 This opportunity is what you make of it, Monica. 
 Now, in the classroom  I have every faith you're gonna make it count. 
 But there are plenty of other resources  that are available to you, as well. 
 Physical therapy, if that's something you need. 
 - It is. 
 - It's covered under your insurance policy. 
 Just call and make the appointment. 
 And you should look into faculty housing. 
 - There's housing? 
 - You need to read over your welcome packet. 
 See, a university is like its own little world. 
 And this whole world is open to you now. 
 So, go enjoy it. 
 - Can I help you? 
 - Why do you call it the Pelican Ranch? 
 - We moved from San Francisco. 
 Always worried we'd miss the ocean. 
 When our agent brought us here,  there was a pelican sitting in the pond. 
 Like the ocean followed us here. 
 Our agent said he'd never seen a pelican here before. 
 - Sandy hair, great tan, white teeth? 
 - You know Mike? 
 - It wasn't a pelican. 
 - Sure looked like one. 
 - Did it fly away when you drove up? 
 - No, it sat in the center of the pond  the whole time we were here. 
 - Haven't seen it since, though. 
 That's because it was a decoy. 
 A big strange bird in the middle of the pond  scares away other birds. 
 Birds that like to eat the trout in the pond. 
 Got any trout in the pond? 
 - Not like we used to. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 I'd like to buy your ranch. 
 - Oh, it's not for sale. 
 - Everything's for sale, buddy. 
 How much? 
 - I mean... 
 - Name your price. 
 - Nine million? 
 - Now, get out of my house. 
 ["Breakdown in G Major" by Eliot Bronson plays] 
 - Whoa, whoa. 
 - This is what you call low-man work. 
 Jimmy. 
 - What do you think you are? 
 - Why isn't Cowboy out here? 
 - He's a day-worker, Jimmy. 
 His ass stays in the saddle. 
 - I've worked years on ranches  where my ass never left the saddle neither. 
 - Maybe you should've stayed there, Walker. 
 - Don't I know it. 
 - What's that? 
 I didn't hear you. 
 Won't fight. 
 Won't work. 
 But you'll sure eat our food won't ya? 
 And sit in our field,  and sing like a f*cking tourist. 
 - Oh, it's your field, is it, Rip? 
 - These are set. 
 - Jimmy, get on the quad. 
 It's grinding, square it off. 
 Keep it tight boys. 
 Bulls will walk through a loose wire like it ain't even there. 
 Hey. 
 The f*ck you doing standing there  Start wrapping wire. 
 - Hell I'm leaving tonight. 
 You can spend my week's wages at the bar  for all I give a sh1t. 
 - All these great ranches you worked at, Walker,  why not go back to one of them? 
 How'd you get in my truck? 
 - Because I can't leave the state. 
 - There's plenty of ranches in Montana. 
 No, you're here because they wouldn't have you. 
 Why is that, Walker? 
 When I start making phone calls,  what am I gonna find out about you? 
 - Well I reckon I got a fondness for the farmer's daughter. 
 I guess we got that in common, don't we? 
 - Come on. 
 - I'm gonna take your f*cking heart out  through your throat, Walker. 
 And shove that little f*ckin' knife up your ass. 
 - If this goes down, we gotta pick sides. 
 - I'm on whatever side you're on. 
 - You won't die today, Walker. 
 But you've taken your last step. 
 Let's see what kinda cowboy you are in a wheelchair. 
 - Here you go. 
 - I'm done with this place. 
 Want to shoot me in the back, old fart? 
 Go for it. 
 - Wherever you go, Walker,  I'll find you. 
 - The whole bunkhouse is watching. 
 - Why do you think I did it, Lloyd. 
 We got two miles of fence to build. 
 Let's go to work. 
 - Fence work don't suit you? 
 - Nothing about this place suits me. 
 - Where you headed? 
 - You know the deal... 
 gonna wander around 'til the next job finds me. 
 - Walker,  You run into trouble, walk the other way. 
 - Nice seeing you, cowboy. 
 - Where you headed? 
 - I quit. 
 - How come? 
 - I'm a cowboy. 
 And that's all. 
 - You know what I mean? 
 - No. 
 - You know, that's all we need from you. 
 - That's not all you needed the other night. 
 - The other night won't happen again. 
 - You say that. 
 Then someone else says something different. 
 Can't figure out who runs this deal. 
 - I run it. 
 And he runs it. 
 You don't listen to nobody else. 
 Head on back to the bunkhouse. 
 Head on back. 
 Take me to the house. 
 We're making some changes. 
 - All right, just, ah... 
 just sign these two at the bottom,  I'll have Beth fill them out. 
 Here. 
 That was Lee's. 
 - When do I start training? 
 - Soon. 
 But let's... 
 Let's get this bunkhouse figured out first. 
 You haven't mentioned her, Kayce. 
 Not once. 
 Or Tate. 
 Or why you're not with them. 
 - What's talking about it gonna do? 
 - It'd help you form a plan to get them back. 
 - Plans are not change the way someone feels. 
 - When Lee ran this place, he... 
 he was honest  and he was fair. 
 With everyone. 
 That's what I need from you. 
 But you can't be that way with others, son,  until you're that way with yourself. 
 - I miss them. 
 - What happened? 
 - You happened, Dad. 
 Then everything happened. 
 - Kayce. 
 Send Rip up to the house. 
 - You enjoying your f*ckin' self? 
 - Beautiful day. 
 Until now. 
 - He in there? 
 - He who? 
 - Hey Rip. 
 - Come here. 
 - My father wants to see you. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Now. 
 - You wanted to see me, sir? 
 - Yeah, have a... 
 Have a seat. 
 In a lot of ways,  you're the only person I can trust, Rip. 
 Because you're the only person  that doesn't benefit when I'm gone. 
 You do it for me. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 And I always will. 
 - I hope so. 
 'Cause what I'm asking next... 
 it'll be the hardest. 
 Kayce needs to learn how to run this place. 
 Needs to learn how to lead these men. 
 And he can't do that while he's living with them. 
 You understand what I'm asking? 
 - There's beer in the fridge. 
 - I don't drink. 
 - Figures. 
 - That's not a penalty! 
 - It is a penalty 'cuz he sucks. 
 - You still want the bet? 
 - Yeah, I'll take 3 and 1. 
 - Why do they both these teams have the same f*ckin' mascot? 
 - Jimmy, you've literally lived here for your entire life. 
 - Be quiet. 
 Be quiet. 
 - And don't know the difference? 
 - So those are the Wildcats, and those are the bobcats. 
 - What's the f*ckin' difference? 
 - Just stop, he doesn't know what he's talking about. 
 A bobcat is a specific breed. 
 A wildcat is just a cat that went wild. 
 That's a run! 
 - So they named their team after a cat that just like,  got out of the house? 
 - It's not rocket science. 
 It's football. 
 - Kid's got a point. 
 - Y'all are ruining this for me,  shut the f*ck up. 
 [guitar playing] 
 - Bobcats look good. 
 - I got my money on 'em. 
 - Okay, so just to clarify,  Colby's mom, that's a cougar? 
 [laughter] 
 - That'll be the last time  you ever refer to my mom as a cougar. 
 - She prefers wildcat? 
 [laughter] 
 - Rawr. 
 - And you thought you got out of prison. 
 - Nope. 
 Hell, I just stumbled into another one. 
 [guitar playing continues] 
 - Should we mount up? 
 - Not up to me, Jimmy. 
 - What's going on? 
 - No clue. 
 - The sooner you push it to a head,  the sooner it's behind you. 
 - You know he's not gonna follow me. 
 
 
 
 Just you. 
 - Ain't about his respect, son. 
 It's about everyone else's. 
 - We'll push 'em up the valley  then over the saddle to East River Road. 
 We'll take that up the canyon. 
 Ryan, you and Colby got point. 
 Walker, Cowboy... 
 you're on swing. 
 Avery and Jimmy you got flank. 
 Rip. 
 You and Lloyd are riding drag. 
 Let's go. 
 - Hope you boys got your wild rag. 
 It's gonna be a bit dusty. 
 - What the hell's going on? 
 - Just a little reminder, Lloyd. 
 They may let us stay here and get old and rusted. 
 But we're just tools. 
 And that's all we'll ever be... 
 ["Bread and Water" by Ryan Bingham plays] 
 ♪ I've lived without bread and I've lived without water ♪  ♪ Stuck outside the middle of the desert wishin' I was home ♪  ♪ Long way from nowhere, wishin' I was somewhere ♪  ♪ Sangre de Cristo to the Devil's Backbone ♪  - Goddam it, Jimmy! 
 - It's too big a gap! 
 - Hold your spot or the whole herd goes. 
 - Here I'll give him a hand. 
 - I got him, goddammit. 
 - I'll flip that horse right on you, you son of a bitch. 
 [groaning] 
 - Are you dead? 
 You're about to be. 
 - Hey! 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 - You needed an excuse. 
 Now you've got one. 
 Not here. 
 I'll do it in front of everybody Kayce. 
 And I ain't gonna it easy for you either. 
 - You all right? 
 - Funny how you can do something you love your whole life... 
 and it just takes one man to ruin the whole f*ckin' thing. 
 - Ahhh! 
 [grunting] 
 [yelling] 
 - You want us to get in there? 
 - No... 
 This needs to happen. 
 - Ahhh! 
 - Go on. 
 Go on Kayce. 
 Take it. 
 Come on. 
 - There ain't no fighting on this ranch. 
 If you want to fight... 
 You come fight me. 
 - We made him earn it. 
 Thank you. 
 Now I need you two to get along. 
 He needs to be able to depend on you, Rip. 
 - Well. 
 I hope you can depend on him. 
 'Cuz I've never seen a shred of proof that you can... 
 But I guess you see something I don't. 
 - He's my son. 
 That's what I see. 
 - Jamie's your son, too, sir. 
 What did you see in him? 
 - Sorry I'm late. 
 - Hey. 
 - Rough day at the office? 
 - It was hard. 
 But good. 
 - What happened? 
 - Let's not talk about work at the dinner table. 
 - Did you meet with the governor yet? 
 - What did I just say? 
 What would you like to talk about, Daddy? 
 What should we share? 
 He's been up since 4 A.M. working. 
 You go to bed night thinking about work  and wake up doing the same. 
 We don't talk about work,  we have nothing to talk about. 
 Are you suggesting we eat in silence? 
 I mean, Is that what you want... 
 Are you 'shushing' me, Daddy? 
 I'm a 35-year-old woman. 
 When I sit at a table,  I will talk about whatever the f*ck I want. 
 - I see nothing's changed. 
 - I don't think she's made it through a whole meal  since she was eleven. 
 - [chuckles] 
 - Oh, uh... 
 [clears throat] 
 You got physical therapy tomorrow. 
 - I know. 
 - You ain't missing it either. 
 - I won't. 
 - Things are becoming a little clearer to me. 
 Quite the sacrifice. 
 - Yeah, well, it's what your father want. 
 - I remember the first time I saw you. 
 So wild. 
 So angry... 
 God, you were beautiful. 
 I remember the way you looked at him. 
 Such devotion. 
 Made me so jealous. 
 And the way he looked at you. 
 I always worried that he'd love you more someday. 
 But he doesn't. 
 - That was never in doubt. 
 - Don't leave. 
 - This is my family. 
 Whether any of you all think of me that way or not. 
 - Where are you going? 
 - Home. 
 - What's that? 
 - It's for this. 
 - We're moving?! 
 - You like it? 
 - Where are you moving? 
 - Run to bed, buddy. 
 I'll come tuck you in in a bit. 
 The university offers housing for faculty. 
 - What about Kayce? 
 - This is closer to Kayce. 
 - That's not what I mean. 
 You gotta really think about the decisions you make, honey. 
 - I have thought about it. 
 Feels right. 
 For Tate. 
 And for me. 
 - Remember this. 
 You two were married in ceremony. 
 Not in some courthouse. 
 Ceremony. 
 That means you're married to him in the afterlife  no matter what you do in this life. 
 You two are stuck together. 
 Want to decide something? 
 Decide how you two are gonna work it out. 
 Or you'll be miserable... 
 forever. 
 - So, you're the big man now, huh? 
 - Uh... 
 Couldn't run the bunkhouse while I was living in it. 
 - So, go live in the main house. 
 - Grown men don't live with their fathers. 
 - Yeah they also don't kick other men  out of the only home they've ever had. 
 - Well he could use some little humility. 
 He ain't nothing but a bully. 
 And that's all he's ever been. 
 - No. 
 He's not a bully, Kayce. 
 He's exactly what our father turned him into. 
 What do you think he's turning you into? 
 Boy, it sure was easy for you to walk away  from a life that you worked so hard to build. 
 - Well, she doesn't want that life anymore. 
 - Let me guess. 
 She left you because... 
 she was afraid that you would turn into him. 
 Instead of proving her wrong, you come here,  and you take the crash course in how to do it. 
 - This place is all I have to give them. 
 I'm just trying to protect it. 
 - I'm protecting it. 
 I'm protecting it. 
 You're really going to sit on boards  and run for office and navigate  the filthy fights a place like this requires?! 
 No you're not. 
 Kayce, you're gonna lose your temper  and put somebody in the hospital  or worse and go to prison  and get sued and lose this place... 
 Just go home, Kayce. 
 Go work on this... 
 And you stay far away from him. 
 When he dies,  you can have this f*cking place. 
 I will give it to you. 
 - All right. 
 Meet me out front in half an hour. 
 - I'll meet you inside. 
 - Out front in half an hour. 
 - Oh, no. 
 I wouldn't miss this for the world. 
 - Great. 
 [chatter and water splashing] 
 - Oh my God. 
 - Kick to me. 
 - No. 
 - Come on. 
 Kick to me. 
 Kick to me. 
 - Why can't I just swim to you?! 
 Not a word. 
 Not a goddamm word. 
 - We need to isolate the muscles without overstressing them. 
 - Fine. 
 Stop moving back. 
 - You're doing great. 
 - Stop moving. 
 You're moving back. 
 - Okay, let's go back the other way. 
 - I don't need the kickboard. 
 - Need to use the kickboard. 
 Come on. 
 One more time... 
 Let's go. 
 - Just kick your leg up and back slowly. 
 - Okay. 
 - Now that the leg is straight,  I want you to wiggle your toes, okay? 
 There you go. 
 - Did they move? 
 - Mm-hm. 
 So weird, I can't feel it. 
 - It not your nerves... 
 it's your brain's ability to process the information  your nerves are transmitting... 
 - Sorry 'bout that. 
 - You need to swim your laps two lanes over. 
 - Daddy! 
 Daddy! 
 Daddy.
