 [MUSIC]   
 I overslept.   
 Yeah, well... you...   
 You slept. That's what matters.   
 Is it too late to go fishing now?   
 [CHUCKLES]   
 Trout are like... they're like bankers.   
 They don't do a damn thing in the morning.   
 Can I try some?    
 Nah. It'll stunt your growth.    
 What does that mean?    
 Means it'll make you short.    
 I'm already short.    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 Yeah, well, not as short as you'll be if you drink coffee.    
 Why don't you bring the net if you're planning on a big one.    
 Why can't we live right here?    
 Like this. All the time.    
 You know, I ask myself the same thing, grandson, every day.    
 Every day.    
 [MUSIC]    
 [FOOD FRYING]    
 [GRUNTS]    
 [UTENSILS BANGING]    
 You ever had fry bread?    
 Mm-mm.    
 My mother used to make it for me when I was young.    
 Coffee?    
 Thanks.    
 So, what you want to do is you... take this bacon, put it down first.    
 Take the eggs, put them over the top.    
 Like that.    
 You hungry?    
 Yeah.    
 Come sit.    
 [GROANS]    
 You're not eating?    
 Beth, I ate hours ago.    
 I think I'll just watch you.    
 Good.    
 Mm-hmm.    
 Hey.    
 [LAUGHS]    
 [MUSIC]    
 [SNIFFS]    
 [MUSIC CONTINUES]    
 [SIGHS]    
 [HORSE WHINNY]    
 Hey, are you going up to the summer camp?    
 Yeah, as soon as I get these panniers full.    
 Cool if I ride with you? I want to see my kid.    
 Monica, if you fall off, they're gonna have my ass.    
 I won't fall off.    
 - But if you do... 
- We ready?    
 She wants to ride up there with us.    
 All right, well, go grab her a horse.    
 All the good ones are up at camp.    
 The only thing left here is a bunch of freight trains and monsters.    
 Well, what the f*ck is wrong with your horse, Jake?    
 Well, that's my horse.    
 Okay. Monica, get on Jake's horse.    
 - Come on. 
- But...    
 We don't have time for this sh1t.    
 Just go get a horse. Let's go.    
 [NEIGHING]    
 His horse seems a bit angry.    
 Yeah, a little bit.    
 You got it, Jake.    
 [LAUGHS]    
 - Why did he pick that one? 
- You know what, Monica?    
 He ain't the sharpest tool in the shed, let me tell you.    
 Want my goddamn good horse back!    
 Oh, now that looks fun.    
 Monica, I don't think he's having too much fun.    
 - [CLICKS TONGUE] 
- Hey. Hey, Monica, goddamn it.    
 [MUSIC]    
 [COWS LOWING]    
 [MUSIC]    
 Well, it doesn't matter, then, does it?    
 Just get it done, okay?    
 Whoa.    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 That's exactly how you do it. Look at you.    
 Don't even need a chuck wagon.    
 We need lemon.    
 There's a big bag of them on the wagon.    
 I'll get it.    
 [PHONE RINGS]    
 Aye. Goddamn it.    
 Yeah?    
 No. Not what I said. Mm-mm.    
 Can you hear me?    
 Hello?    
 Grandpa.    
 One slice or two?    
 - I'd go two. 
- Okay.     
 - [PHONE RINGS] 
- Goddamn it.     
 Yeah.     
 Work follows you wherever you go, Grandpa.     
 Truer words were never spoken.     
 Yeah?     
 No, the BLM transfers with the sale.     
 They have to reapply. That's right.     
 Hello?     
 Goddamn it.     
 Hey.     
 Everything moves up here.     
 I want everything up here.     
 The tents. The fire.     
 The whole goddamn everything.     
 [MUSIC]     
 Is this a better camp?     
 Let's see.     
 Yep, this camp is much better.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Livestock Commission, how can I help you?     
 Just one moment, let me check.     
 - Morning, Jamie. 
- Good morning, Helen.     
 Sweet Grass County attorney on line one. Put him through?     
 Sure.     
 I'll put you right through.     
 [PHONE RINGS]     
 All right.     
 Hey, Randy.     
 You hear about these barrel racers got their rigs stolen?     
 No.     
 These two girls loaded up their horses, were making one last check in the stalls, and got jumped by a couple of guys.     
 Worked 'em pretty good, locked 'em in a horse stall, drove off in their rigs.     
 Took their trucks, trailers, horses, saddles, everything.     
 Jesus.     
 Since horses were stolen, sort of falls into your court, too.     
 I'm short-handed on deputies.     
 Can you spare an agent?     
 Yeah, I'll send you one.     
 You can make a lot of friends if we handle this the right way.     
 Umm... What's the right way?     
 The right way sends a message.     
 You know what I mean?     
 I know what you mean.     
 Helen, could you have Agent Hendon come by the office, please?     
 [MUSIC]     
 Look. Mama!     
 Oh, look at you, baby.     
 - You having fun? 
- Yeah.     
 All we do is fish and eat and fish and eat.     
 That's just what the doctor ordered, huh?     
 Yeah. No better medicine.     
 Where's your dad?     
 Looking for wolves.     
 Well, that sounds ominous. Which way?     
 Bet he's that way.     
 [HORSE GRUNTING]     
 Didn't think that one was broke, Jake.     
 By God, after a day like today he is.     
 Yeah, I see that.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 That's how we used to do it.     
 Yeah, well, never should have stopped.     
 Mm.     
 Well, sir, I wanted to... thank you.     
 You know, I just haven't had, uh... been the right time.     
 No need. You deserve that house, Rip.     
 No, sir, I'm, uh... I'm talking about the letter.     
 Nobody's ever given me anything like that before.     
 Anyways, if we're gonna staked out this summer, we ought to get some more wranglers, you know?     
 We're gonna run out of hands pretty quick around here.     
 What happened to that girl you hired?     
 She's a drifter. Drifters drift. 
You know how it is.     
 - Yeah. Probably for the best. 
- Yeah.     
 Girl in the bunkhouse was a disaster waiting to happen.     
 She actually, uh, she kept the bunkhouse pretty honest.     
 - That a fact? 
- Yes, sir.     
 I'll leave it to you. 
You run the bunkhouse.     
 Sir, does Kayce know that?     
 It was Kayce's idea.     
 I'll let you know what I find. 
[CLEARS THROAT]     
 You do that.     
 Hey, if you, uh... you hire another girl, she needs to be mean or ugly. One of the two.     
 Last thing I need is some love-struck cowboy climbing in the wrong bunk, know what I mean?     
 Mean or ugly. Yes, sir.     
 [MUSIC]     
 [BRANCHES BREAKING]     
 Everything all right?     
 Well... there's no one at the house.     
 No one at the barn.     
 Just feeling kinda lonely.     
 Lonely, huh?     
 Yeah.     
 Well, we can't have that.     
 - Can't do that. 
- No.     
 [GASPS]     
 What do we do?     
 You are one lucky son of a bitch, you show up now.     
 Baby, what do we do?     
 If he wants to watch, we just let him watch.     
 [WHISPERING] Look at him. He's sleeping.     
 Yeah, I know.     
 Oh, I never thought he'd sleep again.     
 I thought the same thing.     
 I wish our lives were like this every day.     
 Just like this.     
 It can be.     
 No, it can't.     
 Used to be.     
 But now the way we used to live for a million years is... it's just an event.     
 Something we do on weekends or holidays.     
 I could do this every day of my life just like this.     
 If that's what you want, just say it.     
 That's what I want.     
 Okay.     
 Then I promise I'll find a way to give it to you.     
 I'll find the patience to wait.     
 It won't be easy, you know?     
 You'll have to give up a lot.     
 Baby, nothing's easy with you.     
 And I've given up everything I got.     
 I knew the stars would help him.     
 [COWS LOWING]     
 [RUSTLING]     
 [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]     
 [FOOTSTEPS]     
 Lost your pack, huh?     
 Don't know where to go.     
 You're looking for friends.     
 Look at me... and know that I am not your friend.     
 I'm your enemy.     
 Whether I like it or not, I am.     
 There's nothing for you here, okay?     
 I'll give you the forest, but the valley is mine.     
 The cattle are mine.     
 If you try to take them, I'll kill you.     
 My father could do that...     
 ... talk to animals and they'd listen.     
 I'm not sure if he was listening.     
 He was listening, son.     
 Sorry to wake you.     
 You didn't wake me.     
 You hear that river?     
 There's seven billion people on the planet, not one of them know I'm here.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Not one.     
 Not a goddamn soul.     
 Good night, Dad.     
 I love you.     
 Shouldn't surprise you they bought it.     
 Wish we'd bought it.     
 It doesn't surprise me they bought it.     
 Surprises me they knew about it.     
 I mean, if a company this big wants to develop in this valley, we are the first call, right?     
 But we weren't.     
 And now I have New York attorneys swaggering through our f*cking fields.     
 Who is Market Equities main competition?     
 MGM. Marriott.     
 What does Marriott own that they don't?     
 Ski resort?     
 But we're an hour and a half from an airport, Bob.     
 It's too remote for...     
 Okay, they're not taking over a resort.     
 They're building an airport.     
 But there's no reason to build an airport because there is no ski resort.     
 [MUSIC]     
 Who do you know at the Department of the Interior?     
 I know the Secretary of the Interior.     
 Call him. Find out if they gave them a lease.     
 They are building an airport and a ski resort...     
 And then they're gonna build a city around it.     
 Buy everything you can around them, Beth.     
 - Everything. 
- How the f*ck did they know about this place?     
 Huh?     
 I mean, does Chase manage their funds?     
 - Goldman, I think. 
- All right.     
 Who's the big, swinging dick in hedge funds over there?     
 Who runs the hot hedge funds at Goldman?     
 There's Micah Greenberg's fund, and Roarke Morris.     
 His fund's on fire.     
 All right, who's heavy in real estate?     
 Roarke. He bridges lines of credit on resort properties then sells them to his fund.     
 f*cking shell game.     
 All right, what's his first name?     
 Roarke.     
 That's his first name?     
 Not a f*cking first name.     
 [MUSIC]     
 You've got to be f*cking kidding me.     
 You know him?     
 Um, it's like Lucille Ball and Fabio had a kid and I have to go make a f*cking deal with him.     
 Goddamn it.     
 Uh, Susan, would you, uh...     
 Get me the address for Cross Creek Ranch, please.     
 Coming your way.     
 Let me go talk to dip-fuck first, see what their plans are.     
 Call you later.     
 Market Equities.     
 Schwartz and Meyer.     
 You're Bob Schwartz's girl.     
 I'm nobody's girl.     
 You're somebody's girl.     
 Okay, let's stop speaking in Billy Joel songs for starters, okay?     
 The Sporting Club.     
 - Jackson Browne. 
- What?     
 "Somebody's Girl" is Jackson Browne.     
 Okay, my mistake, you f*cking cheese dick.     
 - The Sporting Club. 
- Yeah?     
 Good place for an airport.     
 It is.     
 What kind of airport?     
 Is it the kind of airport for you and your buddies' Gulfstreams?     
 Thinking a little bigger than that.     
 How much bigger?     
 Two terminals. Fifty-two gates.     
 Why here?     
 Wind. For one. There isn't much.     
 Could build northeast of Livingston, but... too much wind.     
 And let's be honest, people don't want to fly, then drive another hour to ski.     
 It's why Big Sky never took off.     
 It's the largest mountain in America.     
 The best snow in this hemisphere and the slopes are empty because of the drive.     
 People are just that goddamn lazy.     
 Did you secure a forest service lease?     
 I didn't secure anything.     
 I manage a fund that invests their capital.     
 I sit on the board so I know what's happening, but I don't control what's happening.     
 Hm.     
 You, on the other hand...     
 Militias and casino owners killing their competition.     
 It's f*cking fascinating.     
 The Old West. Still wild.     
 Not anymore.     
 Not when we get here.     
 All that sh1t stops.     
 Think so, do you?     
 Pretend your family doesn't live here.     
 Pretend you don't know anything about this place.     
 What would your end game be?     
 I'd turn it into Park City.     
 Now you're talking. Dan Jenkins was a smart guy.     
 But his dreams just weren't big enough.     
 Why dream about building golf courses when you can build cities?     
 And you, your family's the largest landowner in the valley, you've made Schwartz and Meyer the second largest.     
 Don't play babe in the woods with me.     
 You've been head-hunting since Salt Lake.     
 I feel ridiculous asking this, but I'm just so curious about how your pickled mind works: have you given any thought at all to the ranchers who live here?     
 And what'll happen to them?     
 What'll happen to them?     
 They won't have to be ranchers anymore because they're all so f*cking rich.     
 Good answer.     
 My dad told me once: there will come a day when the only noble job left is fishing because no one's figured out a way to own the ocean.     
 - Yet. 
- That's right.     
 I'm working on it.     
 I bet you are.     
 Mind the flowers when you leave.     
 Will do.     
 - Mmm. 
- [ENGINE STARTS]     
 [HONKS]     
 I like this girl.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 [MUSIC]     
 [COWS LOWING]     
 Head's up! You tying cow lover?     
 No? Go get my rope! Country muh-fucker!     
 That Spanish?     
 I don't know.     
 I'll tell you one thing, though:     
 - she's a hand. 
- WOMAN: You hear me, m*therf*cker!     
 - WOMAN: f*ck you bad later. 
- Ride the hair off a horse, that's for damn sure.     
 But we need someone who can speak English.     
 Hey! Yo!     
 Where'd you learn to cowboy?     
 I been f*ckin' pullin' and draggin' since I kud bounce piss off a rock.     
 That's ain't Spanish. That's Texan.     
 That's ain't Texan. That's gibberish.     
 No, I'm telling you, it's Texan.     
 I can smell 'em a mile away. 
What's your name?     
 Teeter.     
 What's that?     
 Tee-ter.     
 - Did you hear that? 
- I think she's saying "Peter".     
 Your name Peter?     
 
 
 
 Do I look like my f*cking name is Peter, you skunk-hard m*therf*cker?     
 She just called me a m*therf*cker.     
 You understood, that, didn't you, you bow-legged b*st*rd.     
 Hey, you look like you all got bent over on one of them nurse things, f*cked up the ass 'til your knees buckled.     
 This is the kind of girl that got drove to high school wearing a damn hockey helmet.     
 She's gonna go through the bunkhouse like wildfire.     
 She's perfect. Trust me. Hire her.     
 What is this?     
 A little job fair.     
 Hiring cowgirls now?     
 We're equal opportunity here at Yellowstone.     
 Plus, women work twice as hard and eat half as much.     
 Wow. You're a real renaissance man, you know that?     
 - Don't tell anybody, now. 
- [GATE RELEASES]     
 Seen my father?     
 Yeah, he's up at summer camp.     
 With everyone else.     
 He's not answering his phone.     
 Well, that's by design.     
 Something wrong?     
 I can get a message to him if you want.     
 Nothing's wrong.     
 It's just life.     
 Always changing.     
 The one thing he doesn't want it to do.     
 See you soon.     
 Maybe.     
 We're well past playing "hard to get", don't you think, Beth?     
 You and me, we're never past playing "hard to get", baby.

 What in the f*ck are you doing now?     
 In    years, I've have never been alone on this ranch.     
 And we're all alone, Rip.     
 We can do whatever we want.     
 Baby, you've been doing whatever you want your whole damn life.     
 But no one can see us.     
 We could take off all our clothes and we could go running naked through the field, and no one will know about it.     
 I'll tell you what, why don't you run butt-ass naked through that field, and I'll sit here in my jeans and I'll watch you do it, what do you say?     
 Is there anything you ever wanted to do, but you didn't do because everybody would watch you and question you and now doing it is in spite of them and it's about something else  and the moment you imagined is not the moment that you were living?     
 Does that make sense to you?     
 Honestly, I don't even know what you just said.     
 You know, there is something I want to do.

 Any more biscuits?     
 Yeah, well, I think there's plenty.     
 There you go.     
 I'm gonna need more than that.     
 All right.     
 Another one.     
 You're just... You're just like your father.     
 Here.     
 You know my wife... she used to make two Dutch ovens full of biscuits: one for your father and one for the rest of us.     
 He'd stand right by the fire and ask his mother, "How long?"     
 And she'd say, "Five more minutes."     
 Which just meant "soon" to my wife.     
 It didn't mean five minutes.     
 Didn't mean thirty minutes sometimes...     
 He'd stomp off and pout and walk away and come back and ask again and that sh1t would go on for an hour...     
 And when they were finally ready, he'd take a plate of biscuits, nothing else, and he'd just go sit at the edge of the firelight with his back to us and he'd just go at it with both his hands.     
 - They were really good. 
- [MEN LAUGHING]     
 Why is that funny? 
They were really good.     
 Like a wild dog.     
 After an hour of standing over that Dutch oven, she'd sit beside me, her hair a mess, smelling like smoke, madder than hell because she hated cooking those damn biscuits.     
 And I looked at her and said,     
 "Sweetheart, he'll eat anything you put in front of him.     
 Just make him something else that doesn't take all night."     
 Your mom looked at me and she said: "I know.     
 But if I don't make 'em, I can't watch him eat them."     
 Then she went to the tent, laid down and fell asleep.     
 We were branding so I was up before her.     
 That was the last thing she ever said to me.     
 Branding cattle on her goddamn birthday.     
 [SOMBER MUSIC]     
 Makes you wonder the point of it all.     
 Find someone you love so much just to lose them.     
 I'd like to believe there's a plan to it all, but I...     
 I don't see a plan.     
 That's just 'cause we're inside it, Dad.     
 We see the plan.     
 We're standing on it.     
 Yeah. Guess we are.
