 - She's not here, Dad. 
 - ♪ Daddy doesn't pray anymore ♪   
 - Thank you for doing this. 
 You're a good boy, son. 
 - ♪ Guess he's finished talking to the Lord ♪  
 ♪ He used to fold his hands  ♪ And bow his head down to the floor ♪  
 ♪ But Daddy doesn't pray anymore ♪  
 ♪ I remember even when the times were bad ♪ 
 ♪ He'd thank Jesus for everything he had ♪  
 ♪ For a good wife and three children ♪  
 ♪ And the food upon our plates ♪  
 ♪ Everything was right and he said grace ♪

 Not a goddamn inch. 
 ♪ He used to fold his hands ♪  
 ♪ And bow his head down to the floor ♪  
 ♪ Daddy doesn't pray anymore ♪   
 - I'm gonna miss you. 
 - No, you won't. 
 You'll miss who I was a long time ago. 
 Odds are, I was never who you thought I was anyway. 
 [laughs] 
 And when you get my age... 
 Only thing you miss is being young. 
 A chance to do it all over. 
 See that look of wonder in your grandchildren's eyes. 
 The look in your eyes when you was a kid. 
 - ♪ He used to fold his hands ♪   
 - I'm gonna miss all this. 
 - ♪ And bow his head down to the floor ♪  
 ♪ But Daddy doesn't pray anymore ♪   
 - I miss... 
 I miss your mother. 
 And your brother, goddammit. 
 Guess I miss more than I thought. 
 I'm tired of talkin', son. 
 - Only took 90 years. 
 - [groans] 
 - Hey. 
 Come on. 
 It's alright. 
 It's just the whiskey. 
 - ♪ Listen to the preacher read God's word ♪   
 - Just the whiskey. 
 - ♪ We sang his favorite hymn and Daddy didn't make a sound ♪  
 - You thought nobody ever knew. 
 - Knew what, Dad? 
 - Sneak in every night... 
 steal a cookie. 
 And you thought nobody ever knew. 
 I knew.

 - [laughs] 
 ♪ I guess he's finally walking with the Lord ♪  
 ♪ He used to fold his hands ♪ 
 ♪ And bow his head down to the floor ♪

 - My whole life is just a long... 
 series of losing things I love. 
 But I'm not gonna lose this one, Rip. 
 Not this one. 
 [music] 
 - It's 5:47. 
 All quiet out here. 
 You should get some sleep. 
 - I'm not paying you  for your f*cking opinion on my sleep habits. 
 [sighs] 
 [music] 
 [door closes] 
 [exhales] 
 [music continues] 
 [grunts] 
 [groans] 
 [shouts] 
 [groans] 
 - Ah! 
 [groans] 
 [music continues] 
 - Wait. 
 [gasps] 
 - I have every right to be here. 
 I have every right. 
 I have a right. 
 This is--  This is America. 
 [coughs] 
 [panting] 
 - Okay. 
 - What do we do? 
 - First I... 
 I need you clean of this, Beth. 
 - No one's clean of this. 
 - You can't know what we do, honey,  and Tate's gotta come home to something. 
 Give me this, please. 
 - What he's doing is irrational. 
 He's not considering consequences. 
 Maybe it's from arrogance or--  - "Why" doesn't matter. 
 [somber music] 
 This is going to be the end of us. 
 But we're going to do it anyway. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 [police radio chatter] 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [police radio chatter] 
 - Believe me now? 
 - Now what? 
 - Now you choose sides. 
 - They've got me over a f*cking barrel, John. 
 - I understand, Donnie, but they have my grandson. 
 - f*ck. 
 I can't clean this up. 
 How do we hide this? 
 - You trust me every step of the way. 
 - They are never gonna tell you where--  - Yes, they will. 
 Choose, Donnie. 
 - There's no hiding this. 
 - This isn't what you'll have to hide. 
 How long can you keep it quiet? 
 - A day, tops. 
 Tops. 
 - What kind of security do the Becks have? 
 - They use off-duty officers. 
 Rent them through the department. 
 - Are those officers your friends? 
 - They're my cousins. 
 - You tell them to stand down. 
 - John, I gotta... 
 - Donnie, I--  I don't have time to play this game with you, Donnie. 
 Have 'em stand down. 
 - All right. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 If you're going to do this, John,  you gotta do it right:  you gotta make it about cattle. 
 You gotta get a warrant. 
 It's the only way for you to control the narrative here. 
 - Fair enough. 
 John: No, I can see it coming through now, Mitch. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 Kayce. 
 - Don't worry, dad. 
 This is about the only thing I'm good at. 
 [music] 
 I'm going to get him back. 
 - I will not face this world without him. 
 You understand me? 
 - I'm gonna get him back. 
 - After you do, I want you to promise me something. 
 - Okay. 
 - Promise me you'll kill them. 
 - I'm gonna kill them both. 
 I promise. 
 - My brother's still there. 
 [music] 
 [siren blaring] 
 - Sir? 
 - Yeah, pull over. 
 See what they want. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 - Morning. 
 - Is my tail light out? 
 - No, tail lights are good. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 You know this isn't your kind of game, Donnie. 
 Too many skeletons in your closet. 
 - Pop the trunk for me, please. 
 - Do you really think I'm that f*cking stupid, Donnie? 
 - This thing needs to come to a peaceful resolution, Malcolm. 
 And soon, it's the only... 
 This thing is just going to bring it down for everybody. 
 - You just called me by my first name. 
 Who the f*ck do you think you are? 
 You wanna know what I wish for, Donnie? 
 I wish to God that you had children. 
 Now go f*ck off. 
 Let's go. 
 - You have a good day. 
 - Motherf... 
 f*ck. 
 sh1t. 
 - You've reached Teal. 
 Leave a message. 
 - Get out of the house. 
 Go to Great Falls. 
 The Sheriff isn't our friend anymore. 
 - The boy's not with Malcolm, John. 
 And you better keep your word to me here,  or I'm a f*cking dead man. 
 [music] 
 [phone rings] 
 - Yes? 
 Female: John Dutton is on line one. 
 - Things aren't going well, I hear. 
 - No. 
 - I heard from Monica's grandfather... 
 It's always the innocent who pay most dearly  for the things we men do. 
 - I recommend staying on the reservation until this is done. 
 He got Dan. 
 He'll try to get you too. 
 You more than anyone... 
 - I'm ready for that. 
 I'm sending you someone. 
 If you're doing what I think you're doing,  you'll need him. 
 And that lets you know where I stand. 
 On this, I stand with you. 
 - Thank you. 
 - I hope you find him, John. 
 And I hope he's safe. 
 - Yeah, so do I. 
 - Do it. 
 - How many in the house? 
 - Just him. 
 As far as we know. 
 I need to see the warrant. 
 All right. 
 [paper rustling] 
 [humming] 
 [gunshots] 
 [groans] 
 - Where's my son? 
 Where is he? 
 - I don't know. 
 Agh! 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 - There's a lot of stuff I can shoot before you die. 
 - The Montana Free Militia. 
 They're who we used. 
 They got him. 
 - Where do they camp? 
 - Base of the Crazies. 
 The Crazy... 
 Crazy Mountains. 
 - You ever been up there? 
 - Yeah. 
 Up 284. 
 Just before Diamond City. 
 There's a... 
 There's a little beat up house... 
 ...behind a bunch of junkers. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Oh, oh... 
 Oh, man. 
 I'm shot to sh1t. 
 - Don't you know about my family? 
 You didn't think we'd fight back? 
 - No. 
 Nobody ever fights back. 
 - Until now. 
 - Oh, please. 
 Please. 
 Not on the toilet. 
 I don't want to die on a f*cking toilet. 
 - I promised my wife I'd kill you. 
 All a man has is his word. 
 - Okay, good. 
 - You're okay, though, right? 
 Thank God. 
 Come home. 
 - What did he say? 
 - You need to make an amendment to the trust, Beth. 
 Read this. 
 Then do what it asks. 
 I know who loves me. 
 I know who's loyal. 
 I always have. 
 - What does it say? 
 - None of your f*cking business. 
 [whistles] 
 - Come on, boy. 
 All right, it's your turn now. 
 Come on, boy, come on. 
 Feel kind of silly, feeding animals today. 
 I should be helping. 
 - No matter what we're going through, they still gotta eat. 
 - What's going on, Beth? 
 - Walk with me. 
 - You know we have horses, right, Beth? 
 - All right, just... 
 - What are we doing? 
 - I'm going to read to you. 
 - Okay. 
 "My great grandfather had a dream. 
 "All of his sons on the same road. 
 "The same ranch. 
 "Working toward the same goal. 
 "That dream survived a hundred years. 
 "Until me. 
 With me it died. 
 "I didn't have enough sons. 
 "They just kept dying or quitting. 
 "Then one day, not too long ago,  I realized that I have enough sons after all."  - I don't understand, Beth. 
 - He's saying it's yours. 
 - Mine. 
 - Yours. 
 [sniffles] 
 - Well, there's no accounting for taste. 
 But I guess it's the thought that counts. 
 [exhales deeply] 
 [grunts] 
 - Will you read the, um... 
 the end of his letter again? 
 - "They just kept dying or quitting. 
 "Then, one day, not too long ago,  I realized I have enough sons after all."  - He called me his son. 
 - Yeah, baby. 
 He sure did. 
 
 
 
 [music] 
 - I was sent here to help. 
 - Go get Rip. 
 I can't risk you, son. 
 - What do you know, Kayce? 
 - He's with a militia. 
 In the Crazies. 
 We don't have any time. 
 - How can I help? 
 - It's a big ask:  can't attack a fortified position  without knowing the strength of our enemy. 
 In Afghanistan, we'd send an armored vehicle into ambushes. 
 Draw fire to know how many we're fighting. 
 We don't have any armored vehicles.. 
 I'd do it myself, but.. 
 - I know. 
 I'll draw your fire. 
 [music] 
 - You don't want a rifle? 
 - I'm best with my pistol. 
 - Pistol won't pierce armor. 
 - I won't be aiming at their chest. 
 Got any more of that? 
 So he sees danger. 
 So he is sure-footed. 
 So the bullets bounce off. 
 So he moves fast. 
 - You sure you don't wanna draw on me some? 
 - Won't work on you. 
 - Yeah, I figured. 
 - You know, of all the days to ask this of you... 
 I'm sorry it's today. 
 - I can't think of a better day for it, sir. 
 - I'll be covering you on your right. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Let's get in place. 
 - You think they got night vision? 
 - Yeah, and thermal. 
 You can bet on it. 
 [exhales] 
 - I love you. 
 [gunfire] 
 - Livestock Police! 
 Drop your weapons! 
 [gunfire] 
 - Come on! 
 Whoa. 
 - Livestock Police! 
 Drop your weapon! 
 - Down! 
 On the ground, now! 
 - Get the f*ck down! 
 - Livestock Police! 
 Down on the ground! 
 - All the way! 
 All the way down! 
 - Where's my son? 
 Do you know where my son is? 
 - I sure do. 
 - No! 
 f*ck. 
 - Hey! 
 Stop! 
 - Ah! 
 Ah! 
 [grunts and groans] 
 - You deserve a lot worse than this. 
 - God! 
 f*cking cocksucker! 
 - There you go. 
 Get it all out, you son of a bitch. 
 Tell me where my grandson is,  and I'll get you to the hospital. 
 You have my word. 
 Go on, scream. 
 Scream 'till whatever makes you want to hurt a child  to hurt me leaves you. 
 If there's a heaven,  and I sure hope so... 
 - [grunts] 
 - This is your last chance to do something  that just might get you in it. 
 You know, I think a lot about the ten-or-so years  I've got left before there's not much left  for me to do but sit around and reminisce. 
 You, on the other hand, have to cram a lifetime  of reminiscing into the next thirty minutes or so. 
 Or you can lay there and... 
 not telling me  where he is will be your last thought. 
 Not whoever you may have loved  or your brother's ninth birthday. 
 None of that sh1t. 
 Your entire lifetime's gonna be reduced to my grandson's face. 
 It's up to you, Malcolm. 
 - What's he doing? 
 - That's Jupiter, up there. 
 The bright one. 
 Did you know that? 
 - Carter Meads. 
 That's his name. 
 Whitefish, Montana... 
 Whitefish, Montana. 
 - I'll call for a chopper. 
 Get you to the hospital. 
 - I ain't gonna make it to a hospital. 
 - I gave you my word. 
 - I won't hold you to it. 
 - You want company or do you want to be alone? 
 - Alone. 
 I w... 
 I wish we'd never met. 
 - Yeah, I bet you do. 
 [ Heavy Metal Music Playing ] 
 [gunfire] 
 - Tate! 
 - Kayce, I need you to step back. 
 Give my guys a minute. 
 You don't want to see him like this, okay? 
 - See him like what? 
 - No, no, no, no! 
 - No! 
 - We got a trauma specialist on the way. 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me buddy, it's daddy. 
 - No! 
 - It's daddy! 
 [shrieking] 
 - It's daddy, hey. 
 Hey, hey, Tate. 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me, buddy. 
 Look at me. 
 It's daddy. 
 It's daddy. 
 It's daddy. 
 Are you okay buddy? 
 I know you are. 
 I know. 
 [guitar music] 
 [sighs] 
 [sighs] 
 - You're never far away, are you? 
 - Nope. 
 Never far. 
 - We're going to lose this place, you know. 
 - Maybe so. 
 - I can't f*cking wait. 
 What will you do? 
 - sh1t, I don't know. 
 Probably the same thing I'm doing here, just ... 
 Somewhere else. 
 What about you, Beth? 
 What are you gonna do? 
 - Sleep. 
 For a year. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Well, if you want some company. 
 You never know. 
 - I will.
