 [crickets chirping] 
 - How do I arm it? 
 - Once you drop it down. 
 [beeping] 
 - This used to make me sad when I was a kid. 
 Preparing for winter. 
 - Still makes me sad. 
 How'd it go? 
 - You'd better not make up with them. 
 There's no stopping it now. 
 - There's no making up. 
 - I remember you talking about what a fight it is... 
 this place. 
 Always like that? 
 For your dad? 
 And his? 
 - And his before, son. 
 It's the one constant in life--  If you build something worth having,  someone's gonna try and take it. 
 [theme music] 
 - Honey, don't run, you're gonna--  - I'm fine. 
 - See you after school, Lucky. 
 - It's a pretty big bruise. 
 - It's old. 
 Week or so. 
 - So, not related? 
 - Possibly. 
 Could be a stroke initiated by the trauma. 
 Could be on blood-thinners. 
 An internal bleed will show up on a CT scan. 
 - Alright. 
 We treat it like a crime scene 'till you say different. 
 - We're trying to locate a next of kin. 
 - I've arrested the next of kin 15 times. 
 - Hey if you're not gonna help,  could you at least get out of the way. 
 Explain this day-working thing to me. 
 Because it seems to me like you live here now,  but you only work when we move cows,  and we already shipped out all the f*cking cows,  so...what now you get paid to just do nothing. 
 - That about sums it up. 
 - Hey Jamie, tell your dad I'm a day worker now. 
 - I think my father just forgot that he's still here. 
 - So now you're gonna run remind him. 
 - Not my place. 
 - You know Jamie,  of all the dipshits in this outfit,  you just might be alright. 
 - Commander. 
 He's up at the house. 
 - Not here to see John. 
 Looking for Jimmy Hurdstram. 
 - Um, what's he being charged with? 
 - Not being charged with anything. 
 Jimmy? 
 It's bad news. 
 We found your grandfather this morning... 
 - Found him? 
 What do you mean? 
 - It seems he'd been assaulted recently,  and it appears a blood vessel  in his brain ruptured as a result,  and he had a stroke and... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Were you aware of this assault? 
 Know anyone who would want to hurt him? 
 He have a disagreement with anyone? 
 You think of something, you let me know. 
 We need you to go the coroner's office  and sign some paperwork. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 - What happened? 
 - They killed him. 
 I paid and they still killed him. 
 - What? 
 - I f*cking paid. 
 And they still f*cking killed him. 
 [Jimmy shouting] 
 - What the hell is he doing? 
 - [shouting] 
 - C'mon. 
 - Ahhh! 
 Rip: What are you doing? 
 - I need a truck. 
 - Hey, tell me what happened. 
 Hey, hey Jimmy. 
 Hey, hey. 
 What just happened? 
 - They killed him. 
 They killed him and it's my fault. 
 - Who did, Jimmy? 
 Talk to me. 
 Lloyd, Lloyd. 
 Go on. 
 - C'mere, C'mere. 
 Hey. 
 Go on and tell me what happened. 
 What happened? 
 - I owed money. 
 - So they beat your old man to make you pay. 
 Yeah. 
 Why'd you owe money. 
 Why'd you owe them money, Jimmy. 
 - My past life. 
 - You owe anyone else from the past? 
 Okay. 
 Give me the rifle. 
 - I'm gonna to finish this. 
 - Hey. 
 You look at me. 
 You finish it like this,  you end up in f*ckin' prison for the rest of your life. 
 I'm going to show you how to get rid of problems  so they don't become new problems. 
 You hear me? 
 Now hand me the rifle. 
 Hey, c'mere. 
 Go inside. 
 Let me talk to Kayce. 
 We need to take care of this tonight. 
 - We got a lot going on right now. 
 May have to wait. 
 - I'm fine with waiting. 
 But he ain't. 
 Then we're gonna have to clean up that fuckin mess too. 
 - Yeah. 
 We do it tonight. 
 [phone buzzes] 
 - Hello. 
 Christina: We need to talk. 
 - About what? 
 - Not what you think. 
 - Okay. 
 - Meet me at the coffee shop. 
 - When? 
 - Soon as you can get here. 
 - I'll head that way. 
 - Should we go somewhere more private? 
 - Absolutely not. 
 Have a seat. 
 There's convenience, Jamie. 
 And then there's this. 
 Look me in the eye and tell me this was an accident. 
 - I don't know what it was. 
 - So what becomes of me? 
 I know what she knew--  - Nothing. 
 Nothing is gonna happen to you. 
 - Don't lie to me, Jamie. 
 And stop lying to yourself. 
 Do you think you're a good man, Jamie? 
 - I don't know. 
 I'm trying. 
 - Well, try harder. 
 If you want to be a part of our child's life. 
 - Our. 
 What can I do to help? 
 - I'm going to face this on my own. 
 I need you to respect that. 
 - I will. 
 - You have nine months to figure out  what kind of man you are. 
 And how to be a father worth having. 
 - Christina. 
 Christina... 
 Wait! 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Don't go. 
 - I wouldn't tell anyone the child is mine just yet,  just let me--  I don't know how my father's gonna react. 
 - Meaning what? 
 - Meaning...I don't know. 
 - You're going to have a choice, Jamie. 
 Serve your father's family  or serve your own. 
 Like it or not, that choice is coming. 
 - Jeez. 
 - These f*cking students. 
 Can I help you? 
 - Oh, just looking for something  that's more appropriate for school. 
 - As if you factor in appropriate. 
 Excuse me. 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 - You have got to be kidding me. 
 - I need to look in your purse. 
 - Then get a warrant. 
 - Call the police. 
 This isn't my first rodeo with you people. 
 - And what exactly are my people? 
 - Police are on their way. 
 - In for it now, you little bitch. 
 - I've never seen this glass break. 
 Did you throw something through it? 
 - Yes. 
 My face. 
 [phone buzzes] 
 - Hi. 
 - I need help. 
 - Why are you calling me? 
 Why aren't you calling your husband? 
 - Because if my husband came in here,  he'd kill somebody. 
 - Where are you? 
 - On Main Street. 
 Some boutique. 
 Sorry, what's the name of this shithole? 
 - You didn't even bother to look at our sign,  you little thief? 
 - On Main Street. 
 Just look for the police cars out front. 
 - I'm on my way. 
 - Feel free to keep those, if you like. 
 - You're a student at the teacher's college? 
 - I'm a teacher at the teacher's college. 
 - Yeah, right. 
 What are you, twenty? 
 - Twenty-six. 
 Pretty young to be a professor. 
 - What can I say, I'm an overachiever. 
 - I don't see anything in her purse. 
 - I saw her. 
 She either stuffed it down her pants,  Or up her shirt. 
 - Can we see the footage from these cameras? 
 - They don't work. 
 - We can go to the station and search you there  or if you agree we can search you right here on the premises. 
 - May we use one of your dressing rooms? 
 - Be my guest. 
 - Step into the dressing room, please. 
 - If I say no? 
 - You'll be arrested for shoplifting. 
 - What happened to "innocent until proven guilty"? 
 - If you were innocent, you'd be offering ways to prove it. 
 - Remove your shoes, please. 
 Place your hands against the wall and spread your legs. 
 - She doesn't have anything. 
 - I saw her. 
 Look. 
 - Did you take a ring? 
 - f*ck you. 
 - Turn around and face me. 
 Will you remove your shirt, please? 
 Remove your pants, please. 
 Turn around, face the wall,  and remove your underwear. 
 - Beth, we're closed at the moment. 
 - Where is she? 
 - Who? 
 - My sister-in-law. 
 I'm no lawyer, but I believe it's the 4th Amendment  that deals with unlawful search and seizure. 
 - This search is voluntary. 
 - Sure doesn't look voluntary to me. 
 [camera clicks] 
 Leave her alone. 
 Get dressed. 
 I went to high school with you. 
 And you, you babysat her husband. 
 - On her driver's license, her last name is Long. 
 - I doubt that's gonna save you, buddy. 
 - Let's go. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Wait. 
 Don't go. 
 You'll miss all the fun. 
 Well, I'm here. 
 Might as well shop. 
 Oh, that's nice. 
 Nah. 
 Not for me. 
 And you. 
 You f*cking c**t,  I remember when you gave out hand jobs  for lunch money, Veronica. 
 That was before the boob job  and the dermabrasion  and the doctor dumb enough to marry you. 
 That's lovely. 
 Model it for me, would you? 
 Oh, I think we're well past dressing rooms, don't you? 
 Try it on here. 
 You know, it's not a "have to," Veronica. 
 I can just keep smashing sh1t. 
 Try it on. 
 Ooh. 
 Spanx. 
 What a shocker. 
 You know you had an ass like a 12-year-old boy in high school,  What happened? 
 Now we're getting somewhere. 
 Well, you're not a real blonde. 
 What a surprise. 
 - Stop. 
 Doing it to her doesn't undo what she did to me. 
 I didn't steal from you. 
 And you know it. 
 You judged my skin. 
 Just say it. 
 - I judged your skin. 
 I'm sorry. 
 - You're lucky she has a conscience. 
 I was gonna get you to f*ck that mannequin. 
 [chuckles] 
 I could've done this all f*ckin' night. 
 Oh, well. 
 Guess there's always tomorrow. 
 Why don't we go somewhere. 
 Get a drink, wind down for a bit. 
 - I don't drink. 
 - Then you can watch me. 
 C'mon. 
 - They're all staring. 
 - Let 'em. 
 - Doesn't bother you-- what they're thinking? 
 - They're probably thinking some asshole  worked off his twelve pack on my face. 
 And they're not wrong. 
 You know, I certainly understand  why he fought so hard for you. 
 You have a kind soul. 
 The whole world can see it. 
 Some of the world's gonna hate you for it. 
 Today was probably more about that than anything. 
 She looked at you, and she... 
 Younger, prettier... 
 Better. 
 And she f*ckin' hated you for it. 
 Willing to hurt you for it. 
 Well, she's the one hurting now. 
 And you--you'll forget about her in a few weeks,  but she'll never forget you forgiving her. 
 That's gonna haunt that bitch for the rest of her days. 
 - Haunting her wasn't my goal. 
 - That's why it will. 
 You know, Kayce isn't like you. 
 His center isn't set,  you know what I mean. 
 He has the potential to be just like my father. 
 And you owe it to Kayce and your son  to do everything in your power  to prevent that from happening. 
 
 
 
 My mother was the... 
 My mother was the spine of this family. 
 She was the center. 
 Without her, he's... 
 Well, the best of him died with her. 
 And the same thing will happen to Kayce when you leave him again--  and you will leave him again. 
 You're too good for this place. 
 You're too good for this family. 
 But the next time you leave,  you take Kayce with you. 
 Okay? 
 'Cuz he's too good for it, as well. 
 - Mr. 
 Dutton? 
 - Yep, over there. 
 - Why do that? 
 Why ride them in circles? 
 - Just keeping 'em fit. 
 Last little bit of training  before they're turned out for winter. 
 - My daughters want horses. 
 - There's an old saying out here:  "If your daughter's riding a horse,  no one's riding her."”  - [laughs] 
 - So beautiful. 
 Every direction. 
 It's just like a painting. 
 All I wanted was  give people an opportunity to see it, you know. 
 In New York, pick the direction  no matter where you look,  you can't find the horizon. 
 At night, the sky is purple. 
 No stars. 
 The noise is constant. 
 Nobody's from Montana, John. 
 We're all immigrants. 
 I have just as much right to be here as you. 
 As Rainwater. 
 As anybody else. 
 - No one has a right. 
 You have to take the right. 
 Or stop it from being taken from you. 
 - Buy me out, John. 
 Buy the club,  turn it into a landfill. 
 Whatever you want. 
 - I don't have the money. 
 I'm not a rich man, Dan. 
 Contrary to popular belief. 
 I would if I could. 
 For both of us. 
 But I can't. 
 And I can't let you sell it either. 
 Then it's someone else building something else. 
 At this point, you're the devil I know. 
 And I'm stuck with you. 
 - You can't stop me from selling, John. 
 - Dan, you haven't learned a goddamn thing, have you? 
 - So... 
 enemies by Monday again, huh? 
 - We're enemies now. 
 - I suppose we are. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 - Tate in bed? 
 - I think he's being grandfathered. 
 - I swear he gets more affection in one day  than we got in our entire childhood. 
 - That's not funny, Kayce. 
 That's something you should examine. 
 Closely. 
 Where you headed? 
 - I got some more work to do. 
 - You know, I grew up on a ranch, too. 
 I don't remember so much of the work being done after dark. 
 - Baby. 
 I can't do this right now. 
 - Does it make you happy, this work you're going to do? 
 - No. 
 - But you have to. 
 To protect the ranch. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Know what you need, baby? 
 You need a different ranch. 
 - Can't afford a different ranch. 
 - I don't think you can afford to stay on this one. 
 In here. 
 - Can we talk about this tomorrow? 
 - If we'll really talk about it. 
 - We will, okay? 
 We'll talk about it. 
 I promise. 
 [ "Fast Stack" by William Wild playing ] 
 - Rip, can I have a word? 
 - Now's not the time. 
 - I want to go with you. 
 - No, you don't. 
 - I'm already in this place so deep. 
 - He wants you clean. 
 You carry a badge. 
 - The badge hasn't kept me clean. 
 - If you want in,  it's all the way in. 
 - I know. 
 - All right, go get your coat. 
 Come on Jimmy. 
 - Ryan. 
 Ryan. 
 What are you doing? 
 - He doesn't wear the brand. 
 - He will. 
 - Where are you going? 
 - You know the trick  to living a long time in this deal  is knowing when to quit an outfit. 
 And if you had a lick of sense, you'd quit it, too. 
 - Now can I have ice cream? 
 - Nah, one more bite. 
 - [sighs] 
 - There you go. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Did you feed your horse? 
 You think it's fair that you have your dessert  before he has his supper? 
 - I'll be right back. 
 - You hurry up then okay? 
 You don't want that ice cream to melt, do ya? 
 - Uh-uh. 
 - Go on. 
 - Lucky. 
 Goodnight buddy. 
 Enjoy your supper. 
 [rock music playing inside] 
 [gas hisses] 
 [loud music continues] 
 - Jimmy, what are you doing? 
 - Hey, get the f*ck off the balcony. 
 Jimmy. 
 - Jimmy just went f*cking inside. 
 - Jimmy? 
 [choking] 
 - You don't get to sleep through this. 
 - Jimmy! 
 Let's go! 
 - Get the f*ck off the balcony, it's gonna blow. 
 Back the f*ck up. 
 - Jimmy! 
 Son of a bitch. 
 - Jesus, Jimmy, are you okay? 
 - Jimmy. 
 Hey. 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
 - It's mine, I won it. 
 - You gotta be f*cking kidding me. 
 You risked your life for a f*cking belt buckle? 
 Lloyd get him in the truck. 
 - Monica. 
 Monica. 
 Sorry to bother you. 
 Just checking to see that Tate's in there with you. 
 - Tate? 
 No, he's in his room. 
 Tate? 
 - Something happened. 
 - Jake? 
 The f*ck is going on? 
 - Can't find the boy. 
 - My little boy? 
 - Kayce, we can't find him. 
 - Jimmy. 
 Get flashlights out the back. 
 - Tate? 
 - Tate! 
 - Tate. 
 - What's going on? 
 - Baby, he's gone. 
 - What do you mean gone? 
 - He came down here to feed his horse. 
 I thought-- I thought he came back. 
 - Alone? 
 You let him come down here alone?! 
 - No one's alone on this ranch. 
 There's a dozen wranglers down here. 
 Or there's supposed to be. 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 - Oh please. 
 Argue about it later. 
 Let's just find him. 
 - Tate? 
 - Tate! 
 - Tate. 
 - Tate? 
 - Tate! 
 - Tate? 
 - What is this? 
 Did any of you drive back here?! 
 - No sir. 
 - What? 
 What is it? 
 - [screams]
