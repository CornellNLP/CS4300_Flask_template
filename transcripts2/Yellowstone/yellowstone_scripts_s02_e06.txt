 [music] 
 - All these cows are heifers. 
 - Jamie. 
 - Ever think about what you want to be when you grow older? 
 - You. 
 - [laughs] 
 I mean as a job. 
 - I always figured one day I'd do your job. 
 - Take a look at that. 
 - Harvard? 
 - Congratulations, son. 
 - I didn't apply to Harvard. 
 - I applied for you. 
 It's a great honor. 
 And you earned it. 
 You busted your ass in school and this is your reward. 
 - Where's Harvard, Connecticut? 
 - Boston. 
 - That's...that's really far. 
 - You wanna be me someday? 
 Then become something that can help me protect this place. 
 - What do you want me to become? 
 - A lawyer. 
 - You always say that you don't respect lawyers. 
 - Well, then become one that I can. 
 - Why a lawyer? 
 - Lawyers are the swords of this century. 
 Words are weapons now. 
 I need you to learn how to use 'em. 
 - You don't deserve this... 
 - I suppose I'm to blame for you being so angry  you'd want to hurt me ... 
 But it's not me you hurt. 
 It's your brother and your sister. 
 Sit down. 
 You understand it's as much their future  you've risked as it is your own. 
 - Yeah. 
 If I could just... 
 - If you could just what? 
 Explain? 
 What do you want to explain, Jamie? 
 - Well, I um... 
 I didn't tell her everything. 
 - You don't get it. 
 You gave her a thread. 
 And she can weave it into whatever she wants. 
 - Now, you'd better get with her and find out  exactly what it is she wants, you understand? 
 And if what she wants is ruining this ranch  with some story about me,  then you act like my f*cking lawyer  and sue her and her f*cking magazine  right back to New York, you understand? 
 [theme music] 
 - So this is what an Ivy League education can get you? 
 - No, this you have to take. 
 - It's a lot nicer than I expected. 
 - Yeah. 
 And he did all this with no money. 
 - Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 How can I help you? 
 - The sound of a casino making money  is not cards flipping. 
 It's slots ringing ... 
 Little soothing chimes and bells  with no particular rhythm but certainly a harmony. 
 And all of them-- each one--  in the universally pleasing key of 'C.'  - I know how a casino works. 
 And the cards flipping make a difference. 
 My best croupier. 
 Even with nine and a half fingers. 
 He makes more than a row of gas station slots in a week. 
 So, let's skip to the part where you talk to me  about my casino in Paradise Valley. 
 - Hm. 
 Dan Jenkins. 
 What value does he provide you at this point? 
 You already took his land. 
 - Whatever it is you think you're get from Jenkins,  you'll get better from us. 
 - I'm not looking for partners. 
 - And yet, you have one. 
 - Jenkins is worthless to you. 
 We, however, can offer you something of real value. 
 - I'm breathless with anticipation. 
 - Slots. 
 - Only available through our leasing company. 
 - Extorting a public official in his office. 
 With three witnesses... 
 How convenient for me. 
 - We're not obligated to lease out equipment to anyone,  Chairman, we're simply offering you our expertise. 
 - The contractors, the communities,  the Dan Jenkinses. 
 John Dutton. 
 Whatever it is, we know how to negotiate it. 
 Make it stay far away. 
 You're 18 months from needing slot machines. 
 You have plenty of problems to face before that one. 
 - The last thing we want to see is a casino  the size of the f*cking Wynn  on the north gate of the Yellowstone National Park. 
 - And we will f*ck you at every turn, Thomas. 
 Unless we have a reason to support it. 
 And right now, we don't. 
 I suggest you give us one. 
 - I feel an 'or else' coming. 
 - You bet your ass it's coming. 
 - Ladies. 
 - Stirring hornets' nests all over. 
 - They're all so scared, Mo. 
 They got good reason to be. 
 - Watch how he does it. 
 This is the next thing you need to learn. 
 - What I need to do is make some extra money. 
 - What the hell kind of trouble you in, kid? 
 - The kind it takes money to fix. 
 - There's a buckin' horse fraternity at the fairground. 
 You stay on for eight, you'll pull a check. 
 Sitting on a buckin' horse  is the only thing I've seen you do well, Jimmy. 
 - Yeah, I was f*ckin' taped to it. 
 - [laughs] 
 - Think tape can keep you in the saddle? 
 You fall off 'em when they're running straight,  you stick to 'em when they break in two. 
 Maybe that's your talent, Jimmy. 
 - How much does it cost to enter? 
 - Couple hundred. 
 But you can win a few grand. 
 - I don't have a couple hundred to spare. 
 - I'll spot you. 
 - Why would you do that? 
 - Why do you think? 
 - This one's done. 
 - Lloyd. 
 Ready for another. 
 - Go get us another horse. 
 - The balls on this son of a bitch. 
 Quite the about-face on the news. 
 You accepting responsibility for something. 
 Not like you these days. 
 - You in business with the Beck brothers now? 
 - Yeah, I'm putting... 
 I'm putting slot machines in my barn. 
 - Look, it's not a f*ckin' joke. 
 Once they get screws in you, John,  they never take them out. 
 Now, we can have our differences,  but we want them nowhere near this valley. 
 - How'd they get screws in you? 
 - I got in pretty deep at one of their casinos, John. 
 - And? 
 - I couldn't cover the debt. 
 - And? 
 - Then they came up with ways that I could. 
 - And now they own you. 
 - I'm giving the man who used to be my friend some advice. 
 Now, you're on their radar. 
 For the love of God, find a way off it, John. 
 - I never stopped being your friend, Donnie. 
 You stopped being mine. 
 I suggest you start being my friend again,  big fella, because as you can see,  the walls are closing in on all sides. 
 - When you do this in the rodeo, ain't no saddle. 
 Just you, your rigging, and the horse. 
 But for now... 
 let's just see if you can stay in the saddle. 
 - Hell yeah! 
 Jimmy, there you go. 
 One, two, three, keep riding! 
 Four, five, six, seven, honk! 
 [laughs] 
 Jump off. 
 You're a winner. 
 - Rip, you see that? 
 Eight seconds. 
 - Yeah, Jimmy. 
 I saw. 
 Why is he on that rank b*st*rd? 
 - Needs to make some extra money. 
 Gonna have his go at the rodeo. 
 - He can barely sit on the broke ones, Lloyd. 
 You're gonna get the f*cking kid killed. 
 - He sit him pretty good. 
 - Hey Jimmy. 
 You know why you never met an old rodeo cowboys? 
 'Cause there aren't any. 
 - I'm old. 
 - You just look old. 
 - Yeah, I won't die, I promise. 
 - I'll hold you to that. 
 Hey. 
 Make sure he don't get hurt now. 
 - What's next? 
 - We get you in a bucking chute. 
 - Thank you. 
 Hi - Hi. 
 - Dan Jenkins' office. 
 - Uh, do you have an appointment? 
 - Not what I asked... 
 - Stop right ther-- Ahh! 
 - f*ck! 
 - Do you know what a f*cking mess  you've made in this valley? 
 - I didn't kill your f*cking cattle. 
 - I know. 
 The Beck brothers did it so I'd turn on you. 
 They did it because you're building  the biggest casino outside of Vegas  right against my goddamn fence. 
 And if that's what they're gonna do to me,  God knows what they're going to do to you. 
 So you and I find ourselves in an interesting situation. 
 - It's not my casino anymore. 
 Rainwater is pushing me out. 
 The Beck Brothers are pushing their way in. 
 A little late. 
 Wait outside. 
 - I think you, Mister Rainwater, and I  should all sit down and clear the air. 
 - I can arrange that. 
 - Thank you. 
 - That was a nice move. 
 - Wasn't a move. 
 I'm just meaner than you. 
 - So this thing'll buck, Jake? 
 - Curtis been hauling him all year long,  nobody ride him for eight seconds yet. 
 - Just stay on this one for eight seconds  and we'll get you to a rodeo. 
 - I just...climb on? 
 - We'll set the rigging, then you climb on. 
 Now this horse is bred to get you off his back. 
 - Is there like a mechanical bull  or something I can try out first? 
 Just--  - Mechanical bulls are for drunk girls at the county fair. 
 If you gonna rodeo,  you need to find out if you got the stomach for it. 
 Now, get on him. 
 Keep your heels mashed on his neck, Jimmy. 
 I'm gonna fix your hand in that rigging  where you have to take it out. 
 All right? 
 I'd rather you get hung up and dragged around the arena,  than get blown out the backdoor and get your head kicked in. 
 Ethan, you ready? 
 Okay. 
 Stick your chest out and tuck your chin. 
 Jake. 
 Pull it ... 
 - Jeez! 
 Ahhh! 
 Ahhh! 
 - Mash your heels in! 
 - Kid's a natural. 
 That's eight. 
 - Get him, Ethan! 
 - Let go, we got you. 
 - sh1t, f--  That was incredible! 
 - Yeehaw! 
 We finally found something you can do well. 
 You'll be up to your neck in buckle bunnies in no time. 
 - Wait, what's a buckle bunny? 
 - You'll be finding out soon enough,  - Jesus Christ. 
 Where the f*ck are we? 
 This chicken sh1t. 
 Now, there's paranoid, and then there's this. 
 Being seen with me in a diner  won't damn you with the community, Jamie. 
 - I'm already damned. 
 - Okay look,  you're not the first source to have second thoughts. 
 But we're way past that point. 
 - Sarah, I'm an attorney. 
 I am rescinding my permission to be quoted---  I'm sure they covered the First Amendment in law school. 
 I don't need your permission. 
 - Listen... 
 I was angry. 
 The things I said weren't true. 
 Some things I said violate attorney-client privilege. 
 I could be disbarred... 
 I could be disowned... 
 This doesn't just hurt me-- this hurts my family,  this hurts my sister  - Oh yeah, what a lovely woman---  - My brother-- - The killer? 
 You mean that brother? 
 - My family could be ruined. 
 - Your father's ranch isn't a kingdom, Jamie. 
 And he isn't a king. 
 And you... 
 Running for an office that allows you  to rewrite the rules to your father's liking? 
 Your family deserves to lose everything. 
 I can't tell you the pleasure it gives me  to be the one taking it. 
 No man should have this much land. 
 It should be a park or a game preserve. 
 And when I'm done, maybe it will. 
 - Oh, f*ck... 
 Oh, what the f*ck, Jamie? 
 f*ck! 
 f*ck f*ck f*ck! 
 f*ck! 
 - [groans] 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry! 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry... 
 No... 
 Ahhhh! 
 - What happened? 
 Jamie, what happened? 
 - I don't know what happened It just... 
 All went wrong. 
 What do we do? 
 - Let me talk to your father. 
 - No. 
 Rip, no. 
 - I don't work for you. 
 - Yeah... 
 - I don't work for you. 
 - I know, okay. 
 - If you tell him, then he's an accessory to murder. 
 Right now, the only person accountable is me. 
 We need to keep it that way. 
 - Jamie, I'm just a wrangler now. 
 Kayce has my job. 
 - Rip, please... 
 As a friend. 
 I've always treated you like an equal. 
 Like a friend. 
 - Yeah... 
 You have. 
 - It didn't even feel like my hands. 
 It was like... 
 like I was above, watching it. 
 And I don't know what to do. 
 - Okay. 
 Stay here. 
 Don't move. 
 - Working hard as usual, I see. 
 - Give me something to do, Rip, I'll do it. 
 - I got something for you. 
 - I meant ranch work. 
 - All I need you to do is drive a car, Walker. 
 Can you drive a car for me? 
 - Yeah, I can drive a f*cking car for you, Rip. 
 - Thank you. 
 You know Jamie, at some point,  the only way to get rid of the mess  is to get rid of you. 
 Don't put me in that position. 
 - Go jump in that car. 
 Follow me. 
 - Can you help? 
 - I ain't f*cking touching that thing. 
 Go on. 
 - Jamie? 
 Where's her phone? 
 Give it to me. 
 - All right. 
 Let's go. 
 - Say, whose car is this? 
 - It's nobody's. 
 Get in. 
 - You just made me an accessory to murder, didn't you, Rip? 
 - What do you mean "accessory"? 
 Our prints aren't in that rental car. 
 I didn't load a kayak  and a bunch of other sh1t in the back of a pickup. 
 You did. 
 - m*therf*cker... 
 - That's to keep your whining mouth shut. 
 You want off this ranch? 
 You got it. 
 When we get back I'll drive your ass  to the train station myself. 
 - You ain't f*ckin' drivin' me anywhere. 
 I'll walk from the ranch. 
 - No, I want to watch you leave this state. 
 Look at me m*therf*cker. 
 I want to see it. 
 - All right, stop. 
 Stop, stop, stop. 
 - What's the matter? 
 - I'm sorry. 
 I can't do this. 
 Could you, um... 
 Could you leave, please? 
 - I don't understand. 
 If I did something wrong. 
 - It's not you. 
 I just needed closure. 
 - Doesn't look like you want closure. 
 He a bad man? 
 - No. 
 He's a good man. 
 He's just done some bad things. 
 - Who hasn't? 
 - He's going to break my heart. 
 And my son's. 
 I know it. 
 - I think your heart is broken already. 
 And you're the one breaking it. 
 It's not my place to say, but... 
 If a thing is gonna die, it's gonna die. 
 But to kill it so you don't have to go through the pain  of watching it die? 
 Well, now it's dead and you're the killer. 
 You suffer twice. 
 You're the one breaking hearts, Monica.

 - You're a late entry, so you go last. 
 - That's a good number. 
 - Good luck. 
 - That's a buckle bunny. 
 [crowd cheering] 
 [horn blows] 
 - You got three before you. 
 Look at me. 
 If you get put on your ass out there. 
 if you're able, get up and get the hell out of the arena. 
 These people didn't pay to watch you lay in the dirt. 
 Understand? 
 - I'm kinda feelin' nervous. 
 - I bet. 
 [crowd murmurs] 
 
 
 
 - Jesus Christ. 
 - It's just a part of rodeo. 
 - Look at his f*ckin' face! 
 - [groans] 
 - Chute three. 
 - Come on, Jimmy. 
 Come on. 
 - That thing's f*ckin' huge. 
 - This is the real deal, Jimmy. 
 Come on. 
 Get on here. 
 - Jesus... 
 - Hand in there like we showed you. 
 - Hey, tuck your chin. 
 - Stick my chest out. 
 Mash my legs. 
 - Pray like hell and hold on. 
 [crowd cheers]

 - 111, you ready? 
 - Come on, you ready, Jimmy? 
 - I need a minute. 
 - Ain't got a minute. 
 Look at that cowboy pulling the chute gate there,  give him a nod.

 - What just happened? 
 Announcer: A 83 for Jimmy Hurdstram... 
 - You just won, cowboy. 
 - What do I do now? 
 - Wave to the crowd and throw that hat. 
 - Hell of a ride. 
 Let's get you paid. 
 - What's wrong? 
 - Not a thing. 
 - You got shampoo? 
 - Is there a razor in there? 
 - Razor? 
 - Yeah. 
 Come on. 
 - What are you shaving with it? 
 - f*ck you care? 
 - It's my razor. 
 You've got a f*cking beard. 
 I'd like to know where it's been. 
 - You have a f*cking beard, too. 
 What the f*ck are you shaving with it, goddamnit?? 
 - Ugh. 
 Keep it. 
 - You boys better clear out. 
 I ate way too much chili at the rodeo. 
 - Jake, I swear to God, you better wait  'til I get the f*ck out of here. 
 - You got five seconds. 
 Maybe three. 
 - Gotta shower at three in the f*cking morning  to get any peace around here. 
 f*ckin' hurry. 
 Don't you do it Jake! 
 - It's turtling! 
 It's a boy. 
 - Jesus, that was close ... 
 - Hey. 
 You're alive. 
 No sh1t. 
 - Ain't that the truth. 
 - Where's Avery? 
 I just wanna show her. 
 - She left. 
 - Left where? 
 - Didn't say. 
 Just grabbed her sh1t and left. 
 - Wouldn't go in there for 10 or 15 minutes  if I was you boys. 
 - You're even walking different. 
 - I felt different. 
 - You lost ten pounds. 
 - I like it. 
 I just need a beer. 
 - No, you need a f*ckin' bath. 
 - I don't smell that bad. 
 - Nasty ass. 
 - Adios, assholes. 
 - Jesus boys, it looks like leaving this place  is getting contagious, huh? 
 - Where's he going? 
 I'll get my coat. 
 - What's going on? 
 - He's done. 
 - Says who? 
 - Says me. 
 - Where you takin' him? 
 - I don't know. 
 Said he's gonna take me to the train station. 
 Recon I'll figure it out from there. 
 - I'll take you. 
 Go on. 
 - You don't know where it is, Kayce. 
 - I know exactly where it is. 
 Come on. 
 - What'd you do? 
 - I told you. 
 It's what I won't do. 
 - What did he ask you to do? 
 - That's between us. 
 People like to think we ain't animals. 
 Like we've evolved into something different. 
 Prison teaches you real quick, we haven't. 
 you can forget bears and wolves, snakes--  all that sh1t. 
 We're the meanest f*cking thing on this planet. 
 Of all the animals in the kingdom,  we're the f*ckin' worst. 
 - Yeah. 
 I know. 
 - I'm just trying to do things a lil different, that's all. 
 - Yeah, me too. 
 - This ain't different. 
 - You want different? 
 What's your word worth? 
 - Worth my life. 
 - You give me your word  that everything you saw and heard on this ranch  stays with you. 
 And I'll give you my word the next time you come through,  I'll be running it. 
 And I'll run it different. 
 And you'll be welcomed back anytime. 
 - Yeah. 
 I reckon I oughta stay away from here for a while. 
 - I'd recommend it. 
 - I won't forget this. 
 I owe you one. 
 - Yeah. 
 Knowing this world,  I'm sure you'll get a chance to return the favor. 
 - Wear your long johns tomorrow. 
 It's gonna be cold in the morning. 
 - The body has been identified  as Sarah Nguyen from New York,  and her death serves as a stark reminder of the dangers... 
 - Why don't you run up stairs. 
 Try and get some sleep. 
 - I'm too excited to sleep. 
 - Yeah, me too, now go on. 
 Go. 
 - Okay. 
 - Miss Nguyen is the park's third drowning victim  this year, and seventh death overall,  earning 2019 a grim spot in the record book. 
 - Thank you for that. 
 We will of course keep you apprised of the situation. 
 As new information--  - Look at me. 
 Look at me, son. 
 How do we move on from this? 
 I don't know how to do that. 
 - I had no choice. 
 - There's always a choice. 
 You could've jumped in the river. 
 But hurting yourself never entered your mind,  did it? 
 - The body has been identified as Sarah Nguyen from New York,  and her death serves as a stark reminder  of the dangers of this section of river. 
 Miss Nguyen is the park's third drowning victim this year,  and seventh death overall,  earning 2019 a grim spot... 
 - All right, let's go wake him up. 
 Let's go to work. 
 Come on. 
 Get up. 
 Time to go. 
 Get up.

 Whatever you point it at. 
 You know that, right? 
 So if you know that, you also know  you don't have the power to bring it back, do you? 
 Even if we wanted to. 
 Even if it was a mistake. 
 It's not a trick question, Tate. 
 You just gotta be sure before you pull that trigger,  because killing is the one thing you can't undo. 
 - Let's go, Dad. 
 - You see him through there? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Okay, I want you to put those crosshairs  right on his shoulder. 
 Let me know when you've got em in there.

 - Hey. 
 It's all right. 
 It's a big deal taking a life. 
 But everything on this earth has to do it to survive. 
 The trees they're going to kill  all the smaller stuff beneath it. 
 - Killing is the one thing everything on this planet  does to survive, Tate. 
 It's the one thing we all share. 
 Now you share it, too. 
 - Will something kill us too, Grandpa? 
 - Yeah, something will kill us, too. 
 Might be bacteria so small you need a microscope to see it. 
 Might be a big ol' bear. 
 There's no such thing as dying of old age. 
 Something kills us all.
