 [breathing heavily] 
 [eerie atmospheric music] 
 [screams echo] 
 - What happened to you? 
 Ahhhh! 
 - They're in here. 
 - You seen 'em? 
 - Smell 'em. 
 - We'll get these horses gored in that thick sh1t. 
 - Well I'm not leaving $100,000 worth of bulls in that thicket. 
 - Send in the dogs. 
 - [whistles] 
 - Hey Travis, why don't you come on over, bring a horse,  We'll go for a ride, maybe chase some cows. 
 - You've horse traded me enough, Travis. 
 Time I horse traded you. 
 - [chuckles] 
 - Oh, you think that's funny? 
 [bulls grunt] 
 - Boy, if this don't pucker your red eye,  I guess nothing will, huh? 
 - Here we go. 
 - All right. 
 Nobody be a hero. 
 Turn together. 
 - Let's go. 
 - All right, let's split up. 
 - Yah! 
 - Hey hey! 
 - Take that angle! 
 - Ho ho! 
 [men shouting] 
 [bulls grunting] 
 sh1t! 
 They're moving this way. 
 Watch out! 
 Everybody stay back! 
 - I'm coming around! 
 - Goddamn they're angry. 
 - Get the f*ck out of here! 
 - Push 'em out this way. 
 Hurry up! 
 - Here they come! 
 - Go go go go! 
 [dogs barking] 
 [dog whimpers] 
 [leaves rustling, bulls moo] 
 - Kayce! 
 - Yah! 
 Get out of there. 
 - Goddamn boss, that was awful reckless. 
 - It's only reckless if you can't see it through. 
 Hell of a morning, huh? 
 [theme music] 
 [soft music plays] 
 ["What Comes Naturally" by Blackberry Smoke plays] 
 - Get yourself, Kayce, go on. 
 ♪ Hey pretty baby come and spend a little time with me ♪  ♪ Hey pretty baby come and spend a little time with me ♪  ♪ Hey pretty baby come and spend a little time ♪  ♪ I ain't got but one thing in mind... 
 ♪  - What's the count? 
 - 800 so far. 
 Probably another 200 in the mix. 
 - sh1t. 
 - Hey! 
 Keep those bulls away from the cows! 
 - Move, move! 
 Hey bulls! 
 - Jimmy, get up here! 
 Get ready to close that f*cking gate. 
 - Get in there, Jimmy. 
 - Get in there. 
 Go get that gate. 
 - They're f*cking angry! 
 - No sh1t they're angry. 
 Their job is to f*ck, Jimmy. 
 And they ain't f*cked in six months. 
 Better grow eyes in the back of your head  with these bastards. 
 - These go over by the squeeze shoot. 
 And this is the Lane Pulsator IV  Electronic Bull Ejaculator for Artificial Insemination. 
 - What are you gonna do with it? 
 - I'm not doing anything with it. 
 One of you are. 
 - Yeah. 
 That's a low-man's work. 
 - Who's low-man? 
 Bullshit. 
 - Yeah, you'll be covered in that, too. 
 - I ain't no f*cking wrangler. 
 I'm the groomer. 
 Make Gilligan do it. 
 - Oh, I plan to. 
 But you're doing it with him. 
 - Excuse me. 
 Who runs this outfit? 
 Looking for some day-work, if you have any. 
 Trying to make my way to Arizona. 
 References available upon request. 
 - Well you can make your case to that fella right over there. 
 - Howdy. 
 - Hi. 
 - They call me Cowboy. 
 Gentleman tells me you might have some day work for me. 
 Nice spread you got here... 
 [soft music plays] 
 - You have a fundraiser dinner tonight. 
 Another one tomorrow in Helena,  then Thursday at the Stock Farm in Hamilton. 
 My parents are gonna be in Missoula this weekend. 
 They'd love to meet you. 
 No pressure. 
 - I'm gonna grab some coffee. 
 You want some? 
 - What? 
 - Coffee. 
 - Oh, I'm out. 
 Do you wanna grab us some? 
 - Great idea. 
 - Could I have two coffees please. 
 - Mm-hm. 
 Choose a selection from the board. 
 - You know what. 
 You choose one. 
 You know they have machines for this. 
 - Yeah, but this is like, a way fresher brew. 
 Better than a regular drip. 
 - Well I see why the long line. 
 - Oh yeah, people wait all day for this stuff. 
 - Hey, I would let that rest for like... 
 - Hey. 
 - Thank God. 
 Caffeine. 
 A 'pour-over,' God bless you. 
 The best measure of progress in a town is decent coffee. 
 - And obviously,  there's a rent reduction for a multiyear lease. 
 - If I'm in Bozeman this time next year,  Jason here has instructions to poison me. 
 Let's start with six months. 
 - Six-month leases do require payment in advance. 
 - That's fine. 
 Get me account information  and I'll have the money wired tomorrow. 
 Furnish it. 
 - Schwartz and Meyer in Bozeman. 
 I guess we're a real city now. 
 And I didn't think Bozeman could grow any more  after the co-op moved in. 
 - What's the Co-op? 
 - It's kinda like a Whole Foods. 
 - There's a Whole Foods here?? 
 Thank you  - How's the space? 
 - It'll do. 
 I found one. 
 - Yeah? 
 Who? 
 - State Prosecutor in Custer County. 
 She clerked for Stewart in 2014. 
 Former rodeo queen. 
 Pretty girl. 
 - Pretty doesn't matter. 
 - Yeah, it does. 
 - Jesus, she... 
 She looks like you. 
 - Jamie's gonna f*cking hate her. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Here's my issue, Chairman. 
 I've got plenty, but my first one,  is we already have a casino. 
 It would seem to me improving it makes much more sense  than building one 90 miles off the reservation. 
 - Our reservation is not a destination--  it's a gas stop on the way to destinations. 
 Truckers and buses filled with senior citizens  putting nickels in slot machines  will not improve our schools--  - So you want to spend $200 million  building another one?? 
 Off-site casinos come with regulations,  they come with partners we don't control--  - It won't be off-site. 
 We will own the land. 
 And once we do, we annex it into the reservation. 
 - Can we do that? 
 - The precedent's already set. 
 The Chumash did it in Santa Ynez. 
 We can build businesses-- hotels, restaurant. 
 With no state oversight. 
 Because it's part of the reservation. 
 All I need is council approval for the loan. 
 - Ambitious. 
 - It's what I was elected to be. 
 - You were elected to bring change to the reservation. 
 This isn't change. 
 This is the same thing  white man's been doing to us for centuries. 
 And now you're doing it. 
 - Yes. 
 At last. 
 Someone is doing it to them. 
 This is where change begins. 
 - I don't see anything in this proposal  that shows how the money from this development  is gonna help the community. 
 Just your promise it will. 
 And promises are how we got on the reservation  in the first place. 
 - Trusting them is what put us on reservations. 
 And I don't trust them. 
 - You don't get my vote. 
 - Do I need it? 
 I don't need it. 
 - Well you will, Tom. 
 - Well, it's good to see you. 
 So how can I help? 
 - I've reconsidered. 
 The job you offered. 
 I've reconsidered. 
 - Uh... 
 The money we earmarked for that Native American Studies program  was re-allocated until next semester  when we can find a professor. 
 I thought you didn't want to leave the school  on the reservation with one less teacher. 
 You were pretty firm on that, if I recall. 
 - I'm not leaving. 
 What I mean is: I want both. 
 I can teach mornings at the high school,  and afternoons or evenings here at the university. 
 - That's a full plate, and a long drive. 
 - I'm aware of that. 
 - I have a class-- American History. 
 It needs a professor. 
 That gets you in the door until we can get your classes  on the fall schedule. 
 - What era of American History. 
 - Columbus's arrival to the Declaration of Independence. 
 - Columbus. 
 - Are you comfortable with that? 
 - Depends. 
 Which version of Columbus's history am I teaching? 
 - Yours, Mrs. 
 Dutton. 
 - Long. 
 My last name is Long. 
 It used to be "Long Spear,"  until my grandfather was taken from his parents  and sent to a Catholic school  funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  where they changed his name  and tried to teach him how not to be Indian. 
 I look forward to teaching young minds all about the man  who introduced genocide to the Western Hemisphere. 
 - My God. 
 You Beth? 
 - You Cassidy? 
 - Whew. 
 My part of Montana you can stand on a can of tuna  and see the entire state from there. 
 - Not here. 
 - I'm very curious to learn what I can do for you. 
 - Oh I think it's what we can do for you. 
 Come inside. 
 Here. 
 - We're looking at three candidates to support. 
 And wanted to gauge your interest. 
 - I'm flattered by the offer. 
 I have to ask: why aren't you supporting your son? 
 - Clearly you haven't met him. 
 - We want what's best for Montana. 
 And right now, that... 
 that feels like you. 
 - Can you walk my father through  the wounded veterans charity you started. 
 - We save horses from slaughterhouses in Canada  and use them for equine therapy  with war veterans suffering from PTSD. 
 - Well then... 
 Be hard for either side to argue against. 
 - I'm late. 
 I gotta go, Daddy. 
 Love you. 
 - Don't change the hair. 
 - I'm a little worried I won't get the voter turnout. 
 I'm from eastern Montana, towns with 600 people,  not a lot of voters there. 
 - You let me worry about votes. 
 You just worry about being you. 
 - Okay. 
 [playing guitar] 
 - What's your name? 
 - Cowboy. 
 - Your name's Cowboy. 
 sh1t. 
 We're all cowboys. 
 - Ha. 
 The hell you are. 
 And you... 
 you ride a horse like a teenager fucks--  bouncing up and down with your eyes wide,  stunned you're doing it at all. 
 - Only cowboy thing I seen you do is clean your plate. 
 Stand up and tell me I can't cowboy. 
 - I didn't say you can't. 
 I said he can't. 
 And he sure as hell can't. 
 And you don't want me standing up, boy. 
 I'll beat you like a rented mule. 
 - There's one rule on this ranch, Cowboy. 
 If you wanna fight somebody,  you fight me. 
 I guess you forgot that rule, right? 
 Go sit down. 
 [singing and playing guitar in distance] 
 Lloyd,  Go tell Elvis supper's ready. 
 - I'll tell him for you. 
 ♪ ...something you'll never know ♪  ♪ Your only home ♪  - I see your voice didn't get any happier. 
 - Well I guess neither did I. 
 Hell I ain't seen you since-- - The Haythorne. 
 Nebraska. 
 Heard you did a stint. 
 - Seven years. 
 - Yeah well, it's behind you now. 
 Keep it there, son. 
 - I'm trying. 
 How'd this place find you? 
 - I found it. 
 - This ranch... 
 it's ain't like no place you ever worked. 
 You might wanna think about making a U-turn. 
 - Work's the same. 
 Just the ranch name that changes. 
 - No. 
 This one's different. 
 Reminds me of that place down on the border. 
 f*ckin' drug-runners, militia, and all that sh1t. 
 - There ain't no border here, son. 
 - Oh yes there is. 
 We just can't see it. 
 - Don't seem like you've made a friend in the foreman. 
 - Keep an eye on him. 
 Keep an eye on all of 'em. 
 How long gonna stay? 
 - Maybe I'll just push 'em out to pasture  and then head south. 
 - That's a good idea. 
 When you leave I'm going with you. 
 - You don't need permission to leave, Walker. 
 - Here you do. 
 [guitar plays] 
 - How you doin'? 
 - How are you doing? 
 - I'm... 
 Doing, you know? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Can you give us a minute? 
 - Good to see you Kayce. 
 - You too. 
 I was hoping I made it before he fell asleep. 
 - You didn't. 
 - Tell me how this works, Monica. 
 I'm his father. 
 You can't keep me from him. 
 - I'm not trying to keep you from him,  I just have to shield him from what you've done. 
 I can't let him see it catch up to you. 
 - Ain't catching up with me tonight. 
 - You wake him up, you put him back to sleep. 
 - Maybe I'll... 
 I'll just watch him for a bit. 
 Is that okay? 
 - Take all the time you want. 
 [crying] 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 - Let me order you a drink. 
 - No, I'm fine. 
 It's a brand new me. 
 Money's my new drug. 
 - It's my favorite. 
 You found offices? 
 - Right on Main Street. 
 For all the world to see. 
 - So, what's your first move? 
 - You've got these land developers like Jenkins. 
 They find pristine recreational property,  build McMansions, and sell the dream. 
 Some, like Jenkins, they take it further,  build hotels, subdivisions. 
 But they all leave with their tails tucked  because they don't have the cash flow  to make a real business out of land. 
 - You do that in town. 
 - Or you do this-- we set up a fund. 
 That fund buys land,  puts the land in a conservation easement  which cuts the property tax by two-thirds,  then we go to the Department of Agriculture,  and we enroll the land in a CRP. 
 - What the hell is CRP? 
 - It's the federal government paying us not to farm it. 
 - Why would they do that? 
 - To control the supply, Bob. 
 That way they don't have to worry  about local farmers diluting the market. 
 It's pretty f*cking shitty. 
 But it's great for us. 
 The government pay per acre, per year. 
 - How much? 
 - Depends on the land. 
 Around here? 
 Could be 3-400 dollars an acre. 
 The government paid off the land for us in 7 years. 
 We become landlords who get paid not to rent. 
 - Sounds like a pyramid scheme. 
 - With the government at the bottom. 
 We start with a 100 million dollar investment in land. 
 We funnel the CRP funds into more land purchases. 
 We can buy roughly 50 thousand acres per year  without spending a dime. 
 We are profitable by the end of year two  with a net revenue of 46 million per year. 
 The more land we buy, the more that number grows. 
 - Why hasn't anyone done this before? 
 - Because they can't afford the two years. 
 They don't have the investment infrastructure. 
 The Dan Jenkins' of the world  don't have this much junk in their shorts. 
 Know what I mean? 
 How are you fixed for junk, Bob? 
 I understand what's in this for me. 
 Beyond your fee, what's in it for you, Beth? 
 Because something's buried under the skin with you. 
 - I'm making you money, Bob. 
 And I am digging a 200 square mile moat  around my father's ranch. 
 - We put the land into the hedge fund. 
 Use the brokers to buy up the land. 
 Don't haggle on price. 
 Just start gobbling. 
 That's how I'm fixed for junk. 
 - I always knew you tucked it in your sock, Bob. 
 - I need another one of these from...anyone. 
 [chuckles] 
 - Got a whole handful boys. 
 - Easy to say when you're not here. 
 [chatter] 
 - Aw. 
 Sorry buddy. 
 I can't. 
 [chatter] 
 - No, that's not as good as he was. 
 - All right. 
 Hit it. 
 - Ha. 
 - That's game. 
 - You son of a bitch. 
 - It's Saturday night. 
 This all we're gonna do? 
 Jesus! 
 Is it just the one set of testicles y'all share? 
 [Cowboy laughs] 
 - You know, except for the pair I'm wearing,  she's got the only set of balls in this bunkhouse. 
 When I was your age,  we was out in the arena playin' real poker. 
 Cowboy poker. 
 - There's a thought. 
 - Get your ass out in the arena. 
 - Sorry, what's cowboy poker? 
 - We're not gonna do it so don't worry about it. 
 - [imitates chicken] 
 [bulls grunt] 
 - Y'all sure about this?! 
 - Does someone want to explain the rules? 
 - Last one at the table keeps the pot. 
 You want some courage? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Drink up, dipshits. 
 - Y'all are getting horse traded by this ol' b*st*rd. 
 Jimmy, stay seated, no matter what. 
 Bull always goes for the table first. 
 - This is f*cking nuts. 
 - Yeah, there's not a lot smart about it. 
 - Here we go ladies! 
 - Okay. 
 Let it rip. 
 [bull bellows] 
 - Oh geez. 
 - f*ck that! 
 - [laughs] 
 - That's the stupidest thing I've ever done. 
 - Ha ha ha! 
 - Move. 
 - Woo! 
 [laughing] 
 - Well, I'll be damned. 
 God, did you see that. 
 Balls of steel. 
 - You okay? 
 - Hey, you're gonna need this. 
 - Swore, there was plenty to take my money. 
 - Give me my money. 
 - That's some cowboy sh1t, girl. 
 - She lost her hat, she owes us a six pack. 
 - The f*ck I do. 
 - What are you dipshits doing?! 
 - It's a Saturday. 
 - I know what f*ckin' day it is, Jimmy. 
 Don't be messing with that bull. 
 If you guys want to get drunk,  you go down to the f*cking bar. 
 Get out of here. 
 Go on get out of here. 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 Get out of here. 
 Go on. 
 - [groans] 
 - Get the f*ck out of here. 
 - Who won? 
 - Your trooper. 
 She never moved. 
 - Is that right then? 
 - Yup.

 - Hey, man. 
 Hey. 
 - Hey man, can I--  Hey man. 
 - Hey. 
 - [ laughs ] 
 It's like I'm a f*cking ghost. 
 So, uh, where'd you learn to cowboy? 
 - My family ran relay races. 
 Indian relay races. 
 You ever seen people running relays at the Olympics? 
 It's like that, but on horses. 
 My dad had me break all the colts  'cause he said that women have quiet souls,  makes the horses quiet. 
 
 
 
 - Where's your family now? 
 - Dead or in prison. 
 - We got a lot in common. 
 - [laughs] 
 You look like the roadie for a white rapper. 
 You couldn't ride a horse if you were strapped to it--  - Actually, if you strap me to it, I do pretty good. 
 No, I was talking about our families. 
 - Told you. 
 I don't have one. 
 - That's what we have in common. 
 - Excuse me. 
 You wanna dance? 
 - Sorry man, we're having a conversation. 
 - I didn't ask you to dance. 
 I asked her. 
 - I'm good, buddy. 
 Thanks. 
 - So that's a no? 
 - Yeah, that's a no. 
 - Jimmy. 
 Answer's no, buddy. 
 We're having a serious conversation. 
 - So, uh... 
 f*ck off. 
 - What the f*ck did you just say to me, huh? 
 - Sorry. 
 f*ck off. 
 - All right. 
 m*therf*cker. 
 Let's f*ck off over here. 
 I'll be right over here, m*therf*cker. 
 - You need to learn the art of de-escalation. 
 - We're with the Yellowstone. 
 No one's gonna mess with us---  - Ryan! 
 m*therf*cker! 
 - Yo! 
 What the f*ck, you son of a bitch. 
 Take that, m*therf*cker! 
 Get his old f*cking ass! 
 [music continues] 
 [grunting] 
 - That's why you don't go to the bar without me. 
 - Shouldn't go to bars at all. 
 Not a good thing happens there. 
 Not a one. 
 - This feels broken. 
 - What you get for trying to be a hero. 
 - What the f*ck happened? 
 - What's goin' on? 
 - Bunch of the wranglers got worked over. 
 - What do you mean "worked over"? 
 - Had the hell beat out of them. 
 - I'll take care of this. 
 I said I'll take care of it. 
 - You don't get to tell me what to do anymore. 
 [music playing] 
 - Whoah! 
 - Holy sh1t! 
 - Jimmy, you f*ckin' come out here. 
 Call 'em out, Jimmy. 
 - Him. 
 - No, yes...right there! 
 [shouting] 
 - Run, get his ass. 
 Get his ass. 
 - Right there, right there. 
 - Get that son of a bitch. 
 Come here. 
 - Right there, right there! 
 Green shirt, green shirt! 
 - Right there. 
 - Get him, Walker! 
 Get his fucking-- - Hey, stop! 
 - Bitch, let's go. 
 - Ahh! 
 - You're going to live up to the brand  or I'm gonna f*ckin' take it back, do you hear me? 
 Motherfu--  - Rip, first things first. 
 - Open the f*cking door. 
 - f*cking Christ. 
 - Ho, ho, ho. 
 - Come on. 
 [whistling] 
 - Hey, hey, hey! 
 All right, okay. 
 - What the f*ck, Rip? 
 - Maybe next time someone puts their hands  on someone from the Yellowstone,  you'll think to give me a f*cking call. 
 Or have your bouncers break it up. 
 Or both. 
 - Or maybe next time I'll burn it down. 
 - Carla, how are you today? 
 - This is about as good as sober gets, Commissioner. 
 - [laughs] 
 Okay. 
 Good morning. 
 - Good morning. 
 - Here you go. 
 - [sighs] 
 Morning, Dan. 
 Impressed you're eating solid foods so soon. 
 - That cowboy wit. 
 Never gets old. 
 - Yeah, I bet you're gonna miss it. 
 Your last meal before you hit the road? 
 - On the contrary, John, why would I leave? 
 I've come to love Montana. 
 Everyone is so welcoming. 
 - Yeah, well, your head wasn't screwed on straight. 
 We straightened it. 
 You're welcome. 
 - There goes that wit again. 
 Oh, I went to the sheriff. 
 - John, your breakfast's ready. 
 - Thank you, sweetheart. 
 - But on the way, I turned around. 
 I don't want to see you taken away in handcuffs. 
 Where's the fun in that? 
 Where's the fun in having you read about me  taking over the Yellowstone in some jail cell? 
 I want you on the Yellowstone when I take it. 
 I want to watch you dragged from your front porch. 
 - Every man needs a dream, Dan. 
 But dreams take courage. 
 - I haven't seen you since your son died. 
 My condolences. 
 You know, they say there's no greater failure  than a parent outliving a child. 
 Because it's the one failure you just can't ever overcome. 
 Ever. 
 - You should've gone to the sheriff, Dan. 
 You ain't getting cut down next time. 
 Because next time, I'm doing it myself. 
 - f*ck. 
 - You finally got to third base, Jimmy. 
 [chuckles] 
 - I think you make him nervous. 
 - How's he doing? 
 - We finally found his calling. 
 - I mean, really? 
 - He's willing to get after it all day. 
 I guess that's worth something. 
 - Hey Jimmy. 
 - Huh? 
 - Don't worry, there's only about 60 left. 
 - Sixty? 
 [gags] 
 - It's like watching a monkey try to f*ck a football. 
 - [coughing] 
 - Dad... 
 Dad! 
 Dad. 
 - Call 9-1-1! 
 - We can't wait on them. 
 - Get his vest off him. 
 Get his vest off him! 
 - All right. 
 Move him into my trailer. 
 - Put him up on the table. 
 - ALl right. 
 - Easy. 
 - Turn his head to the side so he doesn't choke on his blood. 
 There's a bucket at your feet,  you can use that for his vomit. 
 I need the x-ray machine wheeled right up here. 
 And grab the paddle on the back of it. 
 - That's good. 
 Thank you. 
 Hand me that paddle, slide that paddle under his back. 
 - Don't sweat, dad. 
 - That's great, stop. 
 John, I have to take an x-ray  and see if I can figure out what's going on. 
 - It's the cancer. 
 Colon cancer. 
 - If it was colon cancer, you'd be sh1tting blood,  not spitting it up. 
 Stay still. 
 Just a second. 
 - What is it? 
 - It's not colon cancer, John. 
 You have an ulcer and it's ruptured. 
 - Let's get him to the hospital. 
 - He'll bleed out in 20 minutes. 
 We've got to cauterize it. 
 - You got anesthesia... 
 - My anesthesia's for cattle. 
 It'll kill him and I don't know the algebra  to reduce the dose. 
 He gets a local and that's it. 
 - Just do it. 
 - I need one of you to hold him, I need two to assist. 
 Does anybody have any medical experience? 
 - I do. 
 I'm Navy. 
 I have medic training. 
 - That'll work. 
 What about you? 
 - No training but I've stitched up  about anything that can be stitched. 
 - Unbutton his shirt. 
 I need his shirt open. 
 Iodine, just pour it on. 
 Go, go, go. 
 Directly on his skin. 
 Come on, ready. 
 You all right, John? 
 - I'm not f*cking all right. 
 - Take that, that goes across him.
