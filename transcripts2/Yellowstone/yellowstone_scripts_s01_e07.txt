 The f*ck? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Get back. 
 Get back. 
 All right? 
 Get back before that thing eats somebody. 
 It seems friendly. 
 Well, it's not. 
 Now get back. 
 We won't get any closer. 
 You see that fence? 
 That's mine. 
 That f*cking fence down there, that's mine too. 
 Everything this side of that mountain, all the way over to here, mine too. 
 You're trespassing. 
 Trespassing. 
 - They don't believe you. 
 - What? 
 What's he saying? 
 Says that it's wrong for one man to own all this. 
 He says you should share it with all the people. 
 Yeah. 
 This is America. 
 We don't share land here. 
 - She's ready to go. 
 - Okay, let's prep this. 
 Scalpel. 
 Record first incision, 21:54. 
 21:54 recorded. 
 Drill. 
 Drilling. 
 Let's irrigate this. 
 Saw. 
 Sawing. 
 Sawing. 
 She suffered an epidural hematoma. 
 - Is she alive? 
 - She's alive. 
 She's in recovery. 
 Uh, we had to perform  what's called a craniotomy,  where we remove a piece of her skull,  and we use the suction to remove the hematoma. 
 We got her on a ventilator to help her breathe,  and then, uh, we just continue to relieve the pressure. 
 Is she gonna be okay? 
 With brain injuries, it's impossible  to form an accurate prognosis so soon after the trauma. 
 But, uh, she survived the surgery, many don't. 
 And she's young, she's strong. 
 You have reason to hope. 
 Can we see her? 
 - I don't recommend it. 
 - How about just me then? 
 You were right. 
 I shouldn't have seen her. 
 I wanna see my mom. 
 It's pretty cool, huh? 
 I wanna see my mom. 
 Can you take me to her? 
 Your dad wants you to stay here. 
 - Hey, you need to stay here. 
 - Move your arm. 
 Hey, you need to calm down. 
 Code White. 
 Code White, Code White. 
 - Let me go. 
 - Code White. 
 Let me go. 
 Dad! 
 - Hey. 
 - Oh, calm down. 
 Get off. 
 - Calm down. 
 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Stop. 
 Stop! 
 What did you do? 
 I didn't do anything. 
 He was Code White. 
 Okay, you need to take a little break from this place. 
 I'm staying with my wife. 
 That is not an option until you can find someone  who can supervise him. 
 He's a kid. 
 He didn't do anything wrong. 
 They were holding him on the ground  like a f*cking animal. 
 Right or wrong is not my job. 
 Keeping people safe is,  and this is not safe. 
 So you can come back  when you find someone he'll listen to,  because he clearly will not listen to the nurse. 
 His grandfather's on the way. 
 Well, he is not here now. 
 So you take a break. 
 You need it. 
 Come on, buddy. 
 f*cking cowboys. 
 Since 1886,  every Dutton who died is  buried 300 yards from my back porch. 
 From my great-great-grandfather,  to my wife,  and my oldest son. 
 When a tree grows on my ranch,  I know exactly what fed it,  and that's the best we can hope for, because nothing we do is for today. 
 Ranching is the only business where the goal is to break even. 
 Survive another season. 
 Last long enough for your children to continue the cycle,  and maybe, just maybe,  the land is still theirs when a tree sprouts from you. 
 Lord God,  Lord God, give us rain  and a little luck, and we'll do the rest. 
 - Amen. 
 - Amen. 
 This is my favorite part of the campaign. 
 Before the room is packed with people shouting,  the terror of the polling numbers. 
 No sleep and cold pizza. 
 Not a very good sales pitch of the process. 
 It's hell. 
 In every sense of the word. 
 You know, but it's also exhilarating. 
 The sense that we can make a difference. 
 Shaping ideas into policy. 
 You know, I gotta be honest with you,  I'm not an idealist. 
 I don't want you to think my goal is changing the world. 
 Well, what is your goal? 
 Power. 
 You... 
 You already have power. 
 I want more. 
 Mm, what will you do with it if you get it? 
 Protect my family, and the families like it. 
 Stop the hemorrhaging of Montana's resources  to people in other states. 
 My goal is the opposite of change. 
 That's the most idealistic thing I've ever heard a politician say. 
 Oh. 
 I don't know what it is about break rooms. 
 It's not the break room. 
 It's you. 
 Mmm. 
 Dad? 
 Dad, you awake? 
 You know what a fool I looked like  when no member of my family is beside me at the dinner my office sponsors? 
 Well, my campaign office opens tomorrow. 
 While I was in the room  with the votes you should be campaigning for. 
 We already have those votes. 
 Well, don't bet on it. 
 What happened? 
 Don't know. 
 I feel a shift. 
 What did the governor say? 
 She didn't talk to me. 
 I'll go see her tomorrow. 
 That would be wise. 
 Where's your sister? 
 Pick the bar, Dad. 
 Come they told me  Pa rum pum pum pum  A new born king to see  Pa rum pum pum pum  Our finest gifts to bring  Pa rum pum pum pum  To lay before the king  Thank you. 
 Lee. 
 Here's a present for you. 
 Thanks, bud. 
 Jamie, I got a present for you too. 
 Thanks. 
 Pa rum pum pum pum  Why can't we just start without her? 
 Because you can't, son. 
 Beth. 
 Oh, she's the only child on the planet that would show up late for Christmas. 
 Beth. 
 Beth. 
 I'm in the bathroom. 
 Mom, close the door. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Honey, you don't have anything to be sorry for. 
 Why don't you take a warm bath? 
 It'll help with the cramps. 
 Evelyn? 
 Don't come in here. 
 Ah, just give us a few minutes. 
 Let the boys open a present. 
 Is she okay? 
 She's fine. 
 I'm gonna tell you something my mother told me,  and you're not gonna like it. 
 Everything's different now. 
 All those boys you used to outrun and outwrestle,  that's all done. 
 And they're gonna look at you different. 
 See you different. 
 And then they're gonna look at you like you're less. 
 Like you're somehow weaker today than you were yesterday. 
 You're not, though. 
 You're stronger than all of them. 
 Because if men were responsible for giving birth,  the human race wouldn't have lasted two generations. 
 But after being treated like you're weaker long enough,  you'll start to believe it, too. 
 It's why I'm gonna have to be hard on you, honey. 
 I have to turn you into the man most men will never be. 
 And I'm sorry in advance for doing it. 
 Because you're gonna hate it, sweetheart. 
 I know I did. 
 But I look back and I know my mother was right. 
 It was the best gift she ever gave me. 
 Now I have to give it to you. 
 Whoa. 
 Damn, you got buckaroo'd right onto your peanut. 
 Repeat that in English. 
 I don't speak dipshit. 
 You wanna run, m*therf*cker? 
 Huh? 
 Run. 
 Oh, damn. 
 You don't speak f*cking horse neither, do you? 
 How do you do that? 
 Turn around and I can show you. 
 How's that feel? 
 Like you're three seconds away from being pepper sprayed. 
 Yeah, well, that's what that horse is thinking  when you get on him. 
 Come on, tell me how that feels. 
 It don't feel bad. 
 How about that? 
 Feels like you're scared. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And how about that? 
 Feels like you wanna hurt me. 
 Yeah. 
 Think about this. 
 That horse can feel a fly land on its back. 
 Imagine all it's feeling from you. 
 Every emotion, every thought. 
 If you're thinking it, you bet he's feeling it. 
 Just get on him again and make your body tell him  that everything's gonna be okay. 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 Leave those down on his neck. 
 Don't use the reins? 
 You're asking him to trust you. 
 You ain't gonna trust him? 
 Ride him out. 
 First good thing I've seen in weeks. 
 New hand's a real horse whisperer, huh? 
 Yeah, he is something. 
 I saw a Grizzly in the north pasture. 
 I know, I saw him down there by the river. 
 Let's bring all the fall calves down. 
 Get everything to the barn. 
 Oh, Great Spirit,  may she walk with the Creator  back into my life. 
 Code red. 
 Code red... 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 - Get security. 
 - Just sage. 
 And that's pure oxygen. 
 You're gonna blow the place up. 
 Let go of me. 
 Stop it. 
 Okay, you, out. 
 I need a doctor. 
 The property's essentially worthless without a water source. 
 Worthless? 
 A 90-acre hobby farm sold for $6 million down the street. 
 With a water source. 
 The water table on our property is 25 feet. 
 I could dig a f*cking well by hand. 
 I'd love to see that. 
 Your client already accepted our offer. 
 All you're supposed to do is red line the fine print. 
 The fine print sucks. 
 You get our land for free  and then write off construction costs for years before we see a dime. 
 f*cking Indian tribe's trying to steal your land. 
 The only reason you're not choking on irony is the size of your mouth. 
 Can I remind everyone that our goal here is to make a deal? 
 We agreed to a percentage as payoff. 
 I can't afford your asking price and build a casino. 
 I know how this works. 
 You won't spend a dime on construction. 
 You'll go to Key Bank or TFA Capital and take a loan for the build. 
 You'll outsource management,  except for cushy jobs you hold for friends and family members. 
 You'll negotiate a nice, fat consulting fee for yourself. 
 Then give speeches about how much money it'll make  for the school system. 
 Look, I oversaw the California Lottery. 
 I wrote the book on this bullshit. 
 And I'm fine with all of this. 
 But my piece of the pie will be as big as yours. 
 Period. 
 I have no family to give cushy jobs to. 
 And every penny of profit will go exactly where I say it goes. 
 We want the same thing, Dan. 
 Just for different reasons. 
 I look at this contract, and I can't tell what you want. 
 I want everything that John Dutton has. 
 I want the Yellowstone. 
 Do this with me, and I'll split it with you. 
 There may be ten men on this planet that can afford the Yellowstone,  and you and I ain't one of them. 
 I have a plan for that, too. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, what is it? 
 I only tell my partners that plan. 
 And you are not my partner yet. 
 Call me when you are. 
 Oh, that went well. 
 I'm not trying to sabotage the deal here,  but, uh, if you cede ownership of the land,  he will push you out, you will get nothing. 
 That's his plan. 
 Is there a way that the percentage of the profit  could become a percentage of ownership in the casino? 
 Tribal Gaming Commission will never license you. 
 What about the hotel? 
 We'll make the casino a separate structure. 
 I own the hotel, he owns the casino. 
 That might work. 
 Okay. 
 Find a way to present it. 
 - I'll draft a proposal. 
 - Okay. 
 Speaking of that, what are we doing? 
 I have attorneys for Clean Water Resource  filing a lawsuit against him for altering the flow of the waterway. 
 Once we file, we can present it to the EPA. 
 Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout spawns in that stream,  which is a food source of the Grizzly Bear. 
 That's a violation of the Endangered Species Act. 
 And that is a felony. 
 Ah, well, as John Dutton would say,  he f*cked the wrong bull. 
 Or f*cked with it. 
 I don't know, I can't keep these redneck sayings straight. 
 But good job, Melanie. 
 Good job. 
 Very good. 
 Very good. 
 - Stay still, Mr. Dutton. 
 - Yeah, I will. 
 I'm just... 
 I'm just worried I'm flashing the nurse. 
 - She's seen it all before. 
 - Yeah. 
 The blood work looks good, but I saw something on the scan  I wanna look into. 
 Let's schedule an endoscopy  - in the next month. 
 - Can't wait. 
 Just wish I could've gotten a more dignified cancer. 
 What're you doing here, Tate? 
 - Can I help you? 
 - You're John Dutton? 
 He's not here. 
 - What do you got there? 
 - Mm? 
 Behind your back. 
 You know when John Dutton... 
 When he'll be home? 
 Let me see your hands. 
 Let me see your hand. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no gun. 
 Ah, wait. 
 - Show me your hands. 
 - Wait. 
 - Show me your hands. 
 - Wait, don't... 
 - Show me your hands. 
 - Don't! 
 I'm not here to hurt him. 
 I got something I can only give to him. 
 I'm his son, and his attorney. 
 Give it to me. 
 - His attorney? 
 - Yeah. 
 You're right. 
 I can give it to you. 
 Eh. 
 - Easy. 
 - I can give it to you. 
 Easy. 
 Slow. 
 He's been served. 
 So you wanna walk me through what the f*ck we're doing here? 
 Looking for a bear. 
 What're we supposed to do when we find it? 
 Shoot, shovel, and shut the f*ck up. 
 Jimmy, hand me the rifle. 
 Give me the f*cking rifle. 
 I thought you said you were gonna grab the rifle. 
 You got a gun on you? 
 I can't have no gun. 
 I'm a goddamn felon. 
 - So what do we do? 
 - Story of my f*cking life. 
 Okay, we're gonna haze it out of here. 
 - We're gonna run right at it. 
 - That sounds like a really bad idea. 
 - Ready? 
 - f*ck it. 
 Come on. 
 Hyah! 
 Oh, this is f*cking insane. 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God, help me. 
 Help me. 
 Oh, my God, help me. 
 Ryan. 
 Help me! 
 Oh, my God, help me. 
 Ryan. 
 Oh, God, new guy, help me. 
 Help me. 
 Ryan. 
 Ryan! 
 How good a friend is this sumbitch? 
 How good do you rope? 
 A bit early to get this western, ain't it? 
 
 
 
 - You guys, help. 
 - Am I heading or heeling? 
 Whichever you can catch. 
 You gotta help me. 
 Help me. 
 Oh God, help me! 
 Oh, my God, help me. 
 There you go. 
 There you go. 
 Help! 
 What's your name? 
 Jimmy. 
 Jimmy, you owe me a rope. 
 - Hey, where's my horse? 
 - Halfway to Kentucky. 
 One of these days we'll find one you don't fall off of. 
 Hey, can you guys walk a little slower? 
 f*ck you, Jimmy. 
 Yeah, f*ck you, Jimmy. 
 Okay. 
 Can you feel that? 
 Okay, let me see you wiggle your toes. 
 - Wiggle your toes. 
 - I'm doing it. 
 Okay. 
 Other foot. 
 Very good. 
 Wiggle your toes for me. 
 Very good. 
 Very good. 
 Okay, now, we're gonna take you up to radiology,  when you get back, I'd like to see you eat something. 
 Can you do that? 
 - I'm not hungry. 
 - I'd like to see you try. 
 How serious is this? 
 Well, she's through the worse. 
 Which is surprising. 
 I wasn't optimistic at all. 
 But I'm encouraged by the fact that she has speech. 
 She seems to be aware of her surroundings,  and she's got some feeling in her extremities,  but I am concerned about the lack of motor skills. 
 Those will come back, hopefully, when there is sensation present. 
 We'll watch for bleeds. 
 That's the most severe risk at the moment. 
 But a shower from the fire sprinklers is not gonna help. 
 No more sage, okay? 
 Worked, though, didn't it? 
 Why don't I take Tate back to the ranch? 
 But I wanna stay with Mom. 
 - This is no place for a boy. 
 - You gotta take him. 
 We're gonna send your mom to a CT scan, okay? 
 Let's go. 
 Tate, you should come with me. 
 Love you, baby. 
 Help, please. 
 Help us. 
 You gotta be f*cking kidding me. 
 - Help us, please. 
 - No, I'll help you. 
 Just give me a minute. 
 You're in a real pickle, I ain't gonna lie to you. 
 How'd you get here? 
 Uh, we went for hike and we got lost and then a bear chased us  - and we jumped down here. 
 - Uh, I'm not looking for an answer. 
 It don't much matter now. 
 Is that your boyfriend? 
 - Does he speak English? 
 - No. 
 - What's your name? 
 - Kim. 
 All right, Kim, well, here's the deal. 
 I'm gonna drop this rope down to you. 
 Put it under your arms and I'll pull you up. 
 You catch it, you hear? 
 - We put it around us both. 
 - What? 
 No. 
 That's too heavy. 
 I can't pull up both of you. 
 Listen to me. 
 Explain it to him that I can't f*cking lift both of you! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, grab it with both hands. 
 Listen to me. 
 Grab it with both hands. 
 It's tricky, Tom. 
 At a minimum, it's assault. 
 And if Monica... 
 If Monica dies, it's involuntary manslaughter. 
 Now we're waiting to hear from Tribal General Council  and the federal prosecutor to decide how they wanna charge. 
 Feds don't have jurisdiction on this. 
 - Need to tell them that. 
 - I will. 
 He showing any remorse? 
 Remorse is all he's showing. 
 For her or himself? 
 A little bit of both. 
 He's not a bad kid. 
 He's just had a rough life. 
 Who hasn't? 
 Can I talk to him? 
 On the record or off? 
 There won't be any record of this. 
 - How's she doing? 
 - Hard to say. 
 Am I going to jail? 
 I don't know. 
 I didn't mean to do it. 
 That's the inmate's motto. 
 How about you scream something else? 
 You can't let killing her be your contribution to this life. 
 Say that. 
 I won't let it. 
 If she dies, we gotta charge you. 
 There's no way around it. 
 But if she lives, you get one chance. 
 And it's your last chance. 
 There's only two roads in this life. 
 One's wide as a highway, full of choices. 
 The other one's pencil thin with only two directions. 
 You're on the skinny road right now. 
 Be very careful where you put your feet. 
 What do you wanna do with him? 
 Let him go. 
 For now. 
 This isn't what I expected, Mo. 
 What did you expect? 
 Well, I had big ideas about how to elevate... 
 I thought it'd be easier. 
 That's what the last Chairman said. 
 Sometimes I wonder if I'll make any difference at all. 
 He said that too. 
 Are you okay, Grandpa? 
 Yeah. 
 When's the last time you ate? 
 I don't know. 
 What, what do you mean you don't know? 
 Well, let's fix that. 
 Stay. 
 Stay here, grandson. 
 I need a complete portfolio on Paradise Valley Development Holdings. 
 Everything. 
 Then bring my computer and meet me at my father's ranch. 
 Yes, in Montana. 
 Yes, it will be cold. 
 I don't know how cold. 
 Pack like you're going skiing, Jason. 
 You'll be just fine. 
 - Where's your brother? 
 - Don't know. 
 Not here. 
 What're you doing? 
 Being part of the solution, Daddy. 
 Just like you asked. 
 I, uh... 
 I need you to watch Tate. 
 He's... 
 He's in the other room. 
 Babysitting is where I draw the line. 
 God damn it, Beth, I'm not... 
 I'm not asking. 
 Are you okay? 
 He's in the kitchen. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm your aunt. 
 Hungry? 
 - Kind of. 
 - What do you want? 
 - What can you make? 
 - Cheese plate. 
 Ugh. 
 All right, I got an idea. 
 You wanna go see what the cowboys are having for supper? 
 Sure. 
 - Where's Tate? 
 - He's at the ranch. 
 Where's my grandfather? 
 Right here, darling. 
 Oh. 
 There you are. 
 Yes, ma'am, here I am. 
 Here, let's try to eat some more, okay? 
 Yay, more pudding. 
 It's okay. 
 Here. 
 Here you go. 
 I don't understand why they feed you things in the hospital  we won't let our son eat. 
 Next thing you know, they'll be bringing me bacon. 
 Speaking of our son, where is he? 
 He's at the ranch, babe. 
 It's very exciting to have you all here. 
 It's humbling that you would donate your time,  your passion, to the causes I believe in. 
 That must mean that you believe in them, too. 
 I promise you this,  no matter how hard you work, I'll work harder. 
 But the campaign is just the beginning. 
 The real work starts after we've won, and I'm your new Attorney General. 
 Hey, Jamie. 
 I need you. 
 Give me a call when you get this, will you? 
 I'm sorry to bother you again, sir, but, uh,  we need the sheriff out here. 
 So when you get this, give me a call, will you? 
 Ah, it hurts. 
 You gotta help me here. 
 I'm... 
 I'm not ready for this. 
 God damn it, I got too much to do. 
 I'm gonna get some coffee. 
 - You want some? 
 - I'm all right. 
 Okay. 
 Yesterdayjust came and went  And the day dealt me another hand  Of heartache that I'll play  What we said and what we meant  Two different things, just some words and rings  And time keeps raising the stakes  Let me tell her. 
 You let me tell her. 
 There was nothing to gain, I found  By running the other way  Had to stand my ground  Keep the wolves at bay  Well, I knew somehow  There'd be better days  I stood my ground  Looks like you brought the music festival to me. 
 Wrong side of town  Darkened alleyways  Wolves have gathered around  Yellow wires and blades  There was no one coming around  To save me from the frey  Had to stand my ground  Keep the wolves at bay  Well, I knew somehow  There'd be better days
