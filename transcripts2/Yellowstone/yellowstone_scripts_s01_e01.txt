 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 The state of Montana has never gauged its progress 
 by the size of its cities. 
 We measure our progress 
 by how those cities impact the people 
 and the land surrounding them, 
 the land that feeds them, 
 provides their water, nourishes their souls. 
 This doesn't sound like a legal argument, Mr. 
 Dutton. It sounds like a lecture.  Well, it's a summation of our state constitution, which clearly states that land preservation and property rights take precedence over public expansion. The constitution clearly denotes the state's right to eminent domain and grants the authority to condemn property for the public good. For essential public services like hospitals, schools, highways...not housing developments. Housing is essential. Bozeman has doubled in size in a decade. We're    miles away, and our population is less than it was    years ago. - Why? - Because their fence guarantees we don't grow. Stagnation is death for a town, and the Duttons are the ones killing it. Well, poetic if it were true, since a Dutton founded the town. As it stands, the defendant is correct. Our land use laws are quite clear. For this commission to grant eminent domain, you must show public need, not desire. I think that's enough posturing. - Let's put it to a vote. - The plaintiff hasn't shown any legal imperative for a vote, so this case is dismissed. [GAVEL THUDS] It's   ,    acres, Jamie. That isn't a fraction of the ranch. Okay, look, you can harvest the timber first, no environmental review, nothing. You can cut every tree to the root. You want to suggest to my father that he clear-cut his land, be my guest. You're a braver man than me. Just mention it, Jamie. The town grows, or it dies. Well, maybe it should grow... up. Condos, Alan, like they have in San Francisco. Condos? Who wants to live in a condo in Montana? I don't know how you're gonna get 'em out by yourself. Don't have to get 'em all out. Just that stallion. Once he's gone, the rest will leave on their own. Best of luck. That b*st*rd kicked my truck door so hard, we had to use a crowbar to get it open. That damn mustang's done more in one week to stop drilling than every environmental group in the state. Maybe I should just leave him where he is then. Where'd you find this guy? Yellow pages. Ad says he works with problem horses. Oh, this'll be interesting. Kid's f*cking crazy. [HORSE WHINNIES]  Yeah, uh...sure is building something.  [KNOCK ON DOOR]  - [SOFTLY] Beth. - Of course he didn't. He couldn't find his ass with both hands.  - Bob... Bob needs you. - Give me a minute. I don't think he has a minute. God damn it, Bob, I didn't come here to do business with these people.  I came here to do business with you.  I can hear you screaming halfway down the hall, Craig.  I thought we were gonna try and work this out, Bob.  We've been trying to work this out for three hours, Craig.  This is the alternative.  We don't want to merge.  No one wants to merge with you.  You have a three-to-one debt ratio.  It'd be easier to sell VCRs.  I'm not gonna be bullied by your hatchet man, Bob.  We will pull our funds, and we will take our business down the street to Chase.  We're just asking you to suspend the dividend.  And kill the stock!  What do you think's gonna happen when I dump our   % share tomorrow morning?  I'll tell you what.  The stock will drop below   ,     SEC will suspend trading, and every creditor you have will file on you.  Your company will be chapter    by Friday, and since we're your largest creditors,     I can promise you there'll be no negotiating then.  I will be CEO of IL Energy by Monday.  I will fire every f*cking employee.  Then I will sell your leases and equipment to Chevron for   ¢ on the dollar, and you, buddy, you will have the unique distinction of being the only drilling company to go bankrupt in the largest oil boom of the last century.  Won't that look good on a résumé?  I started this company in my garage.  That's where it's gonna end up if you don't suspend the dividend and allow us to assume management.  Don't look at him.  You're dealing with me now.  So what's it gonna be?  Are we restructuring your company tomorrow or killing it?  Good.  You made the right choice, Craig.  We'll get you through this.

When I turned   , my adoption records were unsealed, and imagine my surprise.  I confronted my adopted parents, who said they lied to protect me.  They said as a Mexican,     I would face discrimination, sure,     but as an Indian, I would know a hatred     that had to be endured to be fully understood.  They thought they were giving me a better chance at life.  That's this nation's policy toward us,     always has been.  If we want a better life, all we have to do     is stop being Indian.

Now, we'll construct our own mill     that will also allow us to harvest wood     directly from the forest,     cutting our lumber cost by   %.  Damming the river here will generate enough power     to light every home in the subdivision.  Now, this is a self-sustaining community        miles from the most pristine wilderness in North America.  Now, if you don't see the potential in that,     we need another bank.
