 ♪ Well I moved into this room ♪  
 ♪ If you could call it that a week ago ♪  
 ♪ I never do what I'm supposed to do ♪  
 ♪ I hardly even know my name anymore ♪  
 ♪ When no one calls it out it kinda vanishes away ♪  
 ♪ I can't get to sleep at night ♪  
 ♪ The parking lot's so loud and bright ♪  
 ♪ The A.C. hasn't worked in twenty years ♪  ♪ Probably never made a single person cold... 
 ♪  - Yeah. 
 - Come with me. 
 - Two flakes a horse. 
 Then you muck out the paddocks. 
 But use a different wheelbarrow. 
 Green ones are for hay. 
 Black for manure... 
 It wasn't my idea to make you low man. 
 So don't read too much into it. 
 - I read it for what it is. 
 It's fine. 
 I deserve it. 
 - Might need it, but you don't deserve it. 
 Just lose yourself in the work, Jamie. 
 Try to forgive yourself and move on. 
 That's all you can do. 
 - Do you forgive me? 
 - I'm your brother, Jamie. 
 - Didn't answer my question. 
 - Yeah, I did. 
 - Hey, we should wait for everyone else. 
 - Grandpa never makes me wait. 
 - You're waiting. 
 - If you wait for everyone to sit at this table,  you'll never eat. 
 - Told ya. 
 - How you feelin', honey? 
 - Like I just left the f*cking spa, Dad. 
 - Hey Gator... 
 - Yeah? 
 - Would you mind making me a smoothie please? 
 - Sure. 
 - What kind of smoothie? 
 - Two scoops of ice cream, three shots of vodka... 
 - Two scoops, three shots. 
 - Got it. 
 - And would you mind bringing it to me on the porch? 
 - Of course. 
 - Please. 
 You should see the other guy. 
 - Excuse me. 
 - Lecturing me on how I behave  in front of the school teacher would be a mistake daddy. 
 What are we gonna tell Jason's parents? 
 - Jason's family is not my concern, sweetheart. 
 You are. 
 - Our grandfathers camped right here. 
 Slept on the ground. 
 Hunted this valley. 
 For ten thousand years. 
 Then John Dutton's grandfather built a house on it. 
 Called it theirs. 
 - Maybe we'll sleep here again someday. 
 What are they doing? 
 - I think they call that "coveting" in the Bible. 
 - What are you up to? 
 - I'm gonna finish what they started with you, honey. 
 - Your smoothie, Miss Beth. 
 - Bless you. 
 - The Becks do that to you? 
 - My face was just the appetizer. 
 - Oh... 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - What doesn't kill us, Dan... 
 - I don't believe that. 
 I don't believe it makes us stronger. 
 Harder, perhaps. 
 - Hard is the goal. 
 - I don't think you can get much harder. 
 - I'm shooting for Teflon. 
 - I understand your father better now,  being here on this ranch. 
 You, too, I think. 
 - That's interesting. 
 When I'm here, I understand me less. 
 - Thank you for coming. 
 Now you know what they did to me. 
 - They did something similar to me. 
 - Mm? 
 What did they do to you? 
 - They pulled my liquor license. 
 They're putting me out of business. 
 I don't see the logic in it. 
 Attacking all three of us. 
 - They want you to leave. 
 They want him to quit building, and they want me to make him. 
 At this point, I say we all have played fairly dirty. 
 But no one's attacked my family on behalf of your business. 
 And No one's attacked yours on behalf of mine. 
 - Nothing any of us say here is gonna change our goals. 
 Our paths will always collide. 
 We fight. 
 One of us will win. 
 But you've been a good enemy, John. 
 A fair enemy. 
 - I don't know if I agree with fair,  but you kept your fight with me. 
 I respect that. 
 - But now we face a new enemy. 
 And they don't play fair. 
 They'll find the thing you care about most  and they'll kill it. 
 - So what do you recommend we do? 
 - I'm open to suggestions. 
 - If you're going to be honest,  be honest, John. 
 You've already decided what you're gonna do. 
 You want us to be part of it  so we don't use it against you. 
 Just say it. 
 So we can figure out how to do it. 
 Say it. 
 - What do you want me to say? 
 - I want you to say that we should kill them. 
 - Is that what you want? 
 Just what you want me to say. 
 - You didn't tell me what you wanted me here for. 
 This is for my protection. 
 All right? 
 I'll say it. 
 We should kill them. 
 We should kill them. 
 - Hand it to me. 
 This is like a blood oath,  except we make the cut later. 
 I'm not like you. 
 If Montana's Livestock Commissioner breaks the law,  it doesn't change the way an entire nation  thinks about livestock commissioners. 
 If I break the law,  every Chairman of every National Tribe... 
 suffers. 
 My people suffer. 
 And no one life is worth that. 
 But I will say this,  when things get lost on the reservation,  they don't get found. 
 Because most of the time, there's no one to look. 
 There will be no one to look. 
 Your turn. 
 - You didn't say it, John. 
 - I don't have to say it. 
 No one here's doing it. 
 - I know some people in LA... 
 No. 
 Nobody from anywhere. 
 If I need your help... 
 Either one of you,  I'll expect you to give it. 
 No questions asked. 
 - May I sit? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 We don't know each other very well. 
 - We don't know each other at all. 
 Don't worry, Monica. 
 It wasn't my father and it wasn't my boyfriend. 
 This was business. 
 - What kind of business does that? 
 - The family business. 
 With that face, I recommend you stick with teaching... 
 Don't judge us  for the way we protect the thing we're giving you. 
 - I'm not judging. 
 I just... 
 I don't understand this place. 
 - I wouldn't try doing that, either. 
 - Tell you what, I'll call you back later. 
 Ahhhhh! 
 - You know, this gets any bigger, people gonna... 
 Gonna start to notice. 
 So how far do you want to take this thing now? 
 - He's not leaving us much choice. 
 We take this all the way. 
 - Well this thing doesn't just stop with John Dutton. 
 He runs this thing with his children. 
 I said... 
 all the way. 
 - Alright. 
 So who do you wanna start with? 
 - The one he loves the most. 
 - I wanna do it. 
 - We'll get you a chance, buddy. 
 This takes a lot of practice. 
 Moment of truth. 
 Whoah. 
 That it? 
 That all you got? 
 You've got a good mind, don't you? 
 - I picked a good one. 
 - You sure did, buddy. 
 - Everyone just disappeared. 
 House is so big you can't tell when someone leaves it. 
 - You get used to that. 
 Hey. 
 Don't do that. 
 Don't have doubts. 
 - I don't have doubts. 
 I have worries. 
 - Don't have those either. 
 - How can I not? 
 - By believing me. 
 That I'm doing what's best for us. 
 I'm just asking you to trust me. 
 - I have class. 
 - We didn't have school today. 
 - It's a holiday. 
 - It's a holiday on the reservation. 
 And we are very far from the reservation. 
 It's a field trip. 
 I'll be home late. 
 - How late? 
 - Real late. 
 - What do you have? 
 - I got nothing, sir. 
 I've been to every damn airport. 
 No one rented a plane to transport hay. 
 I can't even find a feed store that sells clover. 
 Hell, I even ran Dan Jenkins' name through the FAA database  to see if he owned a plane... 
 nothing. 
 This did just come through  from the packing house in Butte. 
 - Been right under my goddamn nose. 
 Look up Malcolm Beck on the FAA's site. 
 - Yes sir. 
 - Out of Billings or Butte. 
 - He's the authorized signer for a Montana Gaming LLC,  which has a Cheyenne 403 Cessna caravan cargo plane... 
 - Three what? 
 - Three Cessna caravan cargo planes, sir. 
 People use them for skydiving. 
 He's got 'em hangared here at the airfield in Billings. 
 - He used his own plane... 
 - Sir? 
 - Nothing. 
 I'll take it from here. 
 - Yes sir. 
 - You guys are gonna love this. 
 Running through the rez like a brand new colt. 
 That's how we do it out on broken rock. 
 This is real freestyle baby It's hip hop. 
 Yes, homeboy, this is my nine to five... 
 - Hey, I've got all these guys. 
 Yeah you know it's my plan. 
 From here to there It's indigenous land. 
 Yeah homie This is my presentation. 
 To get my nation off the reservation. 
 - Let's go. 
 - Hi, how are you folks tonight? 
 - Thank you, enjoy your concert. 
 - Thanks so much. 
 - Thank you for coming. 
 - What the f*ck are you looking at? 
 - Are we safe here? 
 - You'll be fine. 
 - Enjoy your concert. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Thanks for coming.

 Ha! 
 When it all go down who's gonna ride with me... 
 - Put your fists up like this. 
 Make some noise if you're proud to be who you are today, fam. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 - God I wish... 
 they would come back to life  so I could kill 'em again. 
 - That would be what you wish. 
 - Monica... 
 This won't do. 
 - What won't do? 
 - You not speaking to me. 
 It's like we're right back where we started. 
 - What happened to your sister? 
 - My father used to tell me stories  about people trying to take this place. 
 About all the wars he had to fight to keep it. 
 I never believed him. 
 I believe him now. 
 There's people who... 
 All they care about is more. 
 How to get more. 
 Take more. 
 And they'll stop at nothing. 
 As long as it leads to more. 
 - This place isn't a home, Kayce. 
 It's a giant Alamo. 
 You're a prisoner here. 
 So is your sister. 
 So is your father. 
 Now we're prisoners, too. 
 This isn't us, Kayce. 
 My relatives live in smaller houses than this room. 
 - If you want to live in town, we can live in town. 
 Okay? 
 I can drive to work just like everyone else. 
 I don't care where I live so long as we live together. 
 - What about your father? 
 - Of all the problems he has right now,  this is the smallest. 
 - Thank you. 
 - We're gonna need to get a bigger apartment  if we keep doing this every night. 
 - You better start looking... 
 - Does it hurt? 
 - Like hell. 
 But I was built to go through hell, Beth. 
 Yeah, you were. 
 Where are you going? 
 - Back to the bunkhouse. 
 Before I get too used to this. 
 - Well the doctor said stay in bed. 
 - Theres's beds in the bunkhouse. 
 - Can I borrow a truck? 
 - What for? 
 - Check should've cleared by now. 
 - That money's just burning a hole in yer pocket ain't it? 
 - It's for my grandpa. 
 - Wait, Jimmy can you drive? 
 - Lloyd, you are a gambling man. 
 - Feel like you'd be better off taking a bicycle. 
 - We can throw some training wheels on it  for ya there, Jimmy. 
 - Hardy har har. 
 - What the f*ck does that mean? 
 - What the f*ck does that mean? 
 - It's like a sarcastic laugh. 
 - You alright? 
 - No. 
 - Would you like an envelope for that? 
 - No. 
 - Thank you. 
 Is Ray here? 
 
 
 
 - Got any cigarettes? 
 - No. 
 No cigarettes. 
 - Is Ray here? 
 Well, well, well. 
 What have we here? 
 - Can we send him for cigarettes? 
 - Up for a store run, Jimmy? 
 - Where's Ray? 
 Smells like your new cook  doesn't know what the f*ck he's doing. 
 - I'm the new cook. 
 And I know exactly what I'm doing, quitter. 
 Well? 
 Where is it? 
 Jesus, Jimmy. 
 I didn't know goat-fucking paid so well. 
 - We're done. 
 Leave my grandfather alone. 
 - Look whose balls finally dropped. 
 We're square on the money, Jimmy,  but your bitch still owes me  for that little bear spray stunt. 
 - How much is that gonna cost? 
 It's hard to put a price on it. 
 Maybe you bring her over. 
 We'll figure something out. 
 Uh-oh, Jimmy's mad. 
 Maybe you want to repay her debt? 
 How good do you suck? 
 I'm just f*cking with you, Jimmy. 
 Another grand and she's off the hook. 
 - I just gave you all the money I have. 
 - That looks like it's worth something. 
 - Are you gonna ride him today? 
 - Probably not today, buddy. 
 - Tomorrow? 
 - Can't be in a hurry with horses, buddy. 
 - The day after tomorrow? 
 - Spend most of my days wondering why I bother,  then see something like that. 
 And it all comes back to me. 
 Don't like it here, do you? 
 - I love this. 
 But like you said... 
 how often is it this? 
 If every day is a fight... 
 Literally a fight... 
 I don't want my family to be a part of it. 
 These things don't happen in the city. 
 - Of course they do, Monica. 
 Every day. 
 The scale may be smaller. 
 It may only be your purse or your car  someone tries to take. 
 But they try with the same force. 
 You going to tell me those things don't happen in Bozeman  or the reservation? 
 - No, I can't tell you that. 
 - Give us a chance. 
 That's all I ask. 
 Can you do that? 
 - I can do that. 
 - You're supposed to be in bed. 
 - sh1t, I've slept more in the last two days  than I did all last year. 
 - Yeah, well, just take it easy. 
 - I will. 
 - We're starting to have a few too many things in common, big fella. 
 - You got any more of them pain pills left over? 
 If I take any more banamine, I'm gonna f*cking whinnie. 
 - Thank you. 
 I mean it. 
 - I know you do, sir. 
 - I know. 
 - You close to being done there? 
 Need a word. 
 - Well we were just getting started. 
 - You know what, I'll take care of him sir, all right? 
 - I said easy. 
 - Yeah well, Tate will look out for me, won't you tate? 
 Go on run over there. 
 - The Becks have their own plane. 
 Is that useful information to a soldier? 
 - Where is it? 
 - Private airfield in Billings. 
 - Yeah. 
 - It's useful. 
 - Then use it. 
 - How much do you want to know about it? 
 - For this? 
 - Everything. 
 - Set a meeting. 
 Somewhere too far for a man with a plane to drive. 
 - It needs to happen where we can control it. 
 The ranch or the rez. 
 - Set the meeting in Jackson Hole. 
 They'll fly right over us. 
 - Alright. 
 - Dan Jenkins has an SF guy working for him. 
 - Yeah. 
 I met him. 
 - I'm going to need his help on this. 
 - I don't know, Kayce. 
 - I don't know. 
 - Him involved, Dan can't use it against us. 
 I just want this whole thing to be over. 
 - I don't know if this game's ever over, son. 
 - Is it scared? 
 - That why he runs? 
 - No. 
 It's instinct more than anything, you know. 
 With these wild horses, you know they... 
 they're trying to figure out who the boss is,  who they can trust. 
 I mean a tourist will look at, you know,  a mustang that's running around let's just say. 
 And think that they're playing. 
 But they're not playing, Tate. 
 They're seeing where they stand in the world  and who's their friend. 
 Here. 
 Let me zip you up. 
 It's getting cold out here. 
 Better? 
 He sure is good looking isn't he? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Wanna ride him today? 
 Think your dad would get pissed off? 
 - Turns out he's just a big teddy bear. 
 Who knew. 
 - Tell ya what. 
 I'm gonna work with you on this horse. 
 We're gonna sort it out. 
 Make him the best horse we got around here. 
 - Look how well shoveling sh1t suits you. 
 Shocker. 
 You know one day, Jamie,  as much as it f*ckin' astonishes me... 
 someone will love you. 
 And you'll love somebody. 
 And I can't wait to take that from you. 
 Even if I have to kill it with my bare hands,  I will take it from you. 
 - Excuse me. 
 I'm all turned around. 
 This road lead to the park? 
 - No, should've stayed on 89... 
 - I think that's the first time  I've ever seen you be outfoxed. 
 - I'm not outfoxed. 
 He asked me to give it a chance,  Tate's playing with his... 
 new f*cking horse. 
 - Outfoxed. 
 - I just don't like being in the bedroom. 
 The bathroom's a whole different story,  I mean a girl can get used to this. 
 - Well let's just move into the bathroom then. 
 Lord knows there's enough room in here. 
 - This house makes me want to put a baby in every room. 
 Kids running everywhere. 
 It needs chaos to make it a home. 
 - Yeah, I agree. 
 - But then they grow up and... 
 it's quiet again. 
 This place becomes a tomb. 
 - Then we give it away like he did  and Tate and his wife move in here  and then they do the same thing. 
 - You've got a lot of work to do, buddy. 
 - Oh yeah? 
 - Mm-hm. 
 - Better get to it. 
 Kayce. 
 - sh1t. 
 - Well then there's the downside  of having three generations on the same ranch. 
 - Kayce. 
 Get dressed. 
 - Get dressed. 
 - Where am I going? 
 - I don't know. 
 - Get in the back. 
 - What is this? 
 - You're a lawyer tonight. 
 Where'd you think I was taking you? 
 - It's obviously a tribal matter. 
 A tribal employee on tribal land. 
 - He was shot on a country road. 
 It's a f*cking county issue. 
 - We'll see what the chairman thinks. 
 - You do that. 
 - I'll be damned if this doesn't look like you. 
 - This wasn't me and you know it. 
 - I'm not saying it was you. 
 I'm saying it looks like you. 
 You've been real clear about how you feel about this casino. 
 - Now we know who did it. 
 - Witnesses? 
 - No. 
 No evidence other than the bullet hole in his head. 
 - So, now an investigation. 
 - Yep. 
 - That halts construction. 
 - Look. 
 I know them. 
 And they are not gonna wait around for a reaction. 
 They're already planning what's next. 
 So I highly recommend you make a public statement  saying you're halting it on your own. 
 Even that's not gonna stop him,  but it'll slow him down. 
 And give you time to figure out a move. 
 Because right now, you don't have one. 
 And he's gonna take a swing at you next. 
 - He already took one. 
 - John, you need to watch out here 'cuz another one's coming. 
 If he sees deputies outside your place. 
 It'll be me he's after next. 
 I can get State Police... 
 - Nothing would please me more  than them coming on my ranch. 
 I'll leave the gate open. 
 We're taking care of this right now. 
 - Yeah. 
 John. 
 What a surprise. 
 Jackson Hole? 
 During the day. 
 In the square. 
 For all the world to see. 
 Looking forward to it. 
 Who he loves the most.
