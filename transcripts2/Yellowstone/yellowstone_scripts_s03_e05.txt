 [SOBBING] 
 [MUSIC] 
 [SIGHS] 
 I need a favor. 
 I'm not spending my last day here watching you shop on Main Street. 
 I need your help. 
 Jamie. 
 I'm in trouble. 
 [MUSIC] 
 - Who's the father? 
 - That's none of your business. 
 - It is absolutely my business... 
 - No, it's my business! 
 [EXHALES] 
 What difference does it make? 
 [MUSIC] 
 Let me go figure this out. 
 Hi. 
 - Are you Ellen? 
 - I am. 
 We spoke on the phone. 
 You're white. 
 There's a Planned Parenthood in Billings. 
 - Take her there. 
 - I can't. 
 Everyone will know. 
 It's anonymous. 
 Nobody will know. 
 Everyone will know. 
 Listen. 
 You don't want to do this here. 
 A requirement of patients receiving an abortion at this clinic is sterilization. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Understood. 
 Is it okay? 
 Yeah. 
 It's okay. 
 [MUSIC] 
 [MUSIC] 
 [KNOCKING] 
 Where've you been? 
 Went to town. 
 Did you get the test? 
 Yeah. 
 It was negative. 
 Why do you look so sad? 
 We shouldn't do this anymore. 
 [PANTING] 
 [MUSIC] 
 You okay? 
 Bad dream. 
 Bad memory. 
 Hm. 
 Those are worse. 
 Yeah. 
 You wanna talk? 
 No. 
 Not this one. 
 Hey. 
 Tell me anyway. 
 I've made two decisions in my life based on fear. 
 And they cost me everything. 
 Hey. 
 Not everything. 
 [CRYING SOFTLY] 
 Repeat after me: I do solemnly swear that I will support, protect, and uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Montana. 
 I do solemnly swear that I will support, protect, and uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Montana. 
 And that I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity, so help me God. 
 And that I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity, so help me God. 
 Say that last part again. 
 Um... 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 And that I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity. 
 So help you God. 
 So help me God. 
 - Congratulations. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Congratulations, Jamie. 
 - Thank you. 
 He's all yours, now. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We took the long way to get here, but here we are. 
 Here we are. 
 Thank God. 
 I'll help you with your transition then I'm playing golf for a year. 
 Well, thank you, Governor. 
 Thank your father. 
 I know why I'm here. 
 And it wasn't him. 
 Come on. 
 I'll show you your office. 
 [MUSIC] 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 [WHINNYING] 
 [MUSIC] 
 [INTERCOM BEEPS] 
 Sheriff Haskell, line one. 
 Yeah? 
  You know Boyd Nelson, out toward Emigrant? 
  - I know of him. 
 - Committed suicide. 
  Meet me at his ranch. 
  What's that got to do with my office? 
  You'll see. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [MUSIC] 
  [WHINNYING] 
  He leave a note? 
  Sort of. 
 - Son of a bitch. 
  He's got kids, don't he? 
  He's got two of them. 
  Bank take those, too? 
  Well, soon as the Medical Examiner releases a death certificate, Kayce, bank takes everything. 
  Can't take them if they're not here. 
  What if we round them up, and take them down to Billings and put them in a sale? 
  Give those kids some sort of chance at life. 
  Is that legal? 
  Hell, no, it ain't legal. 
  And I'm not so sure that violating probate law should be your first act as livestock commissioner, either. 
  Yeah. 
  What if it was, though, where would you stand on it? 
  He was my cousin, Kayce. 
 That's where I stand. 
  If you wanna do it, I'll look away, but if the bank finds out, you are up to your neck in trouble. 
  [MUSIC] 
  I need to talk to my father. 
  All right. 
  [MUSIC] 
  Do we have to go? 
  Yeah, your dad's gotta work in the city. 
  The city sucks ass. 
  Sucks what? 
  Hey, where are you learning this stuff? 
  Jesus, look at the size of that f*cking spider. 
  That is a big-ass toad. 
  sh1t, you could saddle that sumbitch, and ride his f*cking ass back to the barn. 
  Well, I think I know. 
  Hey, Rip, can you leave our tent up? 
  I want to get Tate out here as much as I can this summer. 
  Yes, ma'am, I can do that. 
  - Thanks. 
 - Um-hum. 
  These are the last ones. 
  Jake, Ethan, drag them pack horses back. 
  Lloyd, find something gentle for them two. 
  Tater, let's saddle that yellow horse - and the white horse. 
 - Ryan, Colby? 
  We're running the fence. 
  [MUSIC] 
  [KISS] 
  You've become a very difficult man to get a hold of. 
  Yeah, well, I have this new rule:     I only carry my phone in places with no service. 
  Otherwise that son of a bitch stays on the kitchen counter. 
  Well, I envy you that luxury. 
  I thought it was time we discuss our new problem. 
  Yeah. 
  Doesn't seem to be going away on its own, does it? 
  Not this one. 
  The FAA has approved a portion of your land as the airport location, as I'm sure you're aware. 
  The state will make an offer and after you refuse... 
  The attorney general handles eminent domain cases for the state, and I'm not concerned with that office anymore. 
  It's the Governor's decision. 
  I'm not worried about that office either. 
  It's four thousand jobs, John. 
  In a state where that makes a difference. 
  Not supporting this will cost her the office. 
  Well, I'm surprised you're against it, Tom. 
  An airport right down the street from your casino, I'm no hotel manager, but that sounds like a good thing to me. 
  I have some ownership issues with the casino property. 
  Well, I'm not going to help you with the problem     that prevents you from building a casino. 
  I don't want a casino any more than I want an airport. 
  I don't really want another casino either. 
  It's an insulting... and wickedly ironic... 
  revenue stream for an Indian Nation. 
  It is a means to an end and that end is this valley looking like it did before a white man stepped foot on it. 
  We want the same thing for very different reasons. 
  And we can have our fight later, but we'll have nothing to fight over if they build a city here. 
  Well, I agree with you on that. 
  You know my business background. 
  It's never one fight that determines if a project moves forward. 
  It's an accumulation of fights. 
  Corporations hate "complicated". 
  And they need to see a return. 
  They have the money. 
 They have the manpower. 
  They have the influence and the reach, but the one thing corporations never have is time. 
  It's their only enemy. 
  And that's how we beat them. 
  We give them a dozen things that take time. 
  Now, I have someone with a reputation of finding those things. 
  And she is merciless when she's found them. 
  Well... 
 I have one of those, too. 
  I'm aware. 
  That's why I'm here. 
 I think they should meet. 
  Put their heads together. 
  Then who knows what mischief they'll come up with together. 
  [MUSIC] 
  I'm just warning you: this genie does not go back in the bottle. 
  Neither does mine. 
  [MUSIC] 
  Get in front of the trader. 
  Right. 
 Wait. 
  I'm watching. 
  Now. 
 Three hundred-thousand at one thirty-five. 
  Tell me when he takes. 
  Short my f*cking stock... 
  Bought? 
 Yes! 
  Take that you little red-headed sh1t. 
  - [PHONE RINGS] 
 - Ahh... 
  Yeah. 
  What? 
  Another point? 
  [GRUNTS] 
  I'm trying to go f*cking fishing! 
  God! 
  God! 
  Why can't we ride with them? 
  'Cause that's a pretty rough haul. 
  Old Blue Jeans, he ain't got any more mountains in him. 
  Who's Blue Jeans? 
  Blue Jeans is the horse you're gonna be ridin'. 
  He's almost as old as your daddy. 
  In fact, I can remember when your daddy used to run all over hell and gone on that son of a... 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Son of a gun. 
  The pirate mouth on that kid needs no help from you, wranglers. 
  - If y'all could just... 
 - Sorry. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It's not your responsibility what my kid says. 
  We'll try and really watch what we say around him. 
  - I'd appreciate it. 
 - Knock, knock. 
  Who's there? 
  Europe. 
  Oh. 
  Europe, who? 
  No, you're a poo! 
  Nope. 
 It's just in him. 
  He's laughing, though, ain't he? 
  Yeah, he is. 
  You can't teach that. 
  Teach what? 
  Toughness. 
  You're either born a willow or you're born an oak. 
  That's all there is to it. 
  [MUSIC] 
  You two ready? 
  Ready ready. 
  [CLICKS TONGUE] 
  RYAN: What in the... 
  You think they wandered in from the park? 
  RIP: Nah, there's too many fences. 
  Who are these son of a bitches here? 
  Come on. 
 Let's go. 
  [MUSIC] 
  Hey! 
  Sporting Club running buffalo now? 
  Sporting Club ain't running sh1t no more. 
  Yell, well, whose are those, then? 
  Don't matter, as long as they're not yours. 
  You got permission to run them things here? 
  No, I just decided today I'd run some buffalo across a field for no reason. 
  Yeah, well, I don't want my cattle getting brucellosis - from them f*cking things. 
 - Keep your cattle on your side of the fence. 
  You oughta tell your boy to watch the bass in his voice when he speaks to me. 
  Boy? 
  - [GUN COCKS] 
 - Hey! 
  I'll blow your shit-for-brains all over this field. 
  Then f*cking do it. 
  Reserve agent, Livestock Association. 
  I will shoot you where you stand. 
  Put that f*cking pistol down. 
  Reserve agent? 
  Duttons are still running that scam? 
  We don't know you. 
  You wouldn't. 
 But your boss does. 
  Tell him Wade Morrow said hello. 
  We'll see each other again, I'm sure. 
  You better hope I never see you again. 
  Next time, fight me fair. 
  sh1t, I'll fight you fair. 
  Get off your horse. 
  We'll save that for a rainy day. 
  I need proof those are brucellosis free. 
  If you're man enough, come and get it. 
  Come on. 
  Why would they leave buffalo out here? 
  They're gonna tear this fence to pieces. 
  That's why. 
  [WOMAN ON RADIO] 
  [MUSIC] 
  [SIGHS] 
  You know, it's   o'clock. 
  Shouldn't you be in a river somewhere? 
  - Bulleit. 
 Rocks. 
 - Yes, sir. 
  There's nothing I love more than to be on the river, but instead, I'm here trying to figure out - why you are poking a grizzly. 
 - Mm. 
  You don't keep them when you catch them. 
  No. 
  You throw them back. 
  Yes. 
  I could respect you if you ate them. 
  That makes sense to me. 
  But of all the sh1t a trout has to go through in a day... 
  eagles trying to eat them, raccoons trying to eat them, otters, ospreys, bigger fish, hawks. 
  It also has to wonder if every floating dead insect has a f*cking hook in it because you think it fighting you for its life... 
  Is fun. 
  It doesn't hurt the fish. 
  They don't process pain the way other animals do... 
  [LAUGHS] 
  What f*cking pescetarian told you that, huh? 
  It is fascinating that the one vertebrate on this planet that doesn't rely on pain as a survival device is the one that you like to hook in the f*cking mouth. 
  To be honest, I could give a sh1t if it hurts the fish. 
  I don't like the way it tastes. 
 That's why I throw them back. 
  Well, why didn't you say that in the first place, huh? 
  That I understand. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Schwartz and Meyer shorting our stock is like a terrorist bombing a subway. 
  It doesn't stop the subways and it doesn't destroy the city the subway serves. 
  It just hurts some people, and not the people you want to hurt. 
  But it does make the people you want to hurt want to hurt you back. 
  You going to try and hurt me back, is that what you're trying to say? 
  Hmm? 
  Because I have been down this road many, many times before, buddy. 
  And no one who tried it is alive to tell you how poorly that worked out for them. 
  What, are you saying you're going to hire a f*cking hitman to come after me if I come after you? 
  We could buy Schwartz and Meyer fifteen times over. 
  That land is not your family's legacy. 
  It is a relic that will continue to appreciate until your family can no longer afford it and then you will lose it. 
  Wealth is the only legacy left, and you know it. 
  Fight us and you'll lose all your money and you lose the land. 
  Or be the smart business woman you are and make us a deal that creates a real legacy for your family. 
  Five, six hundred-million dollars. 
  Generational wealth. 
  I agree on all fronts, Roarke. 
  I do. 
  And I wish to God that he would do that, but he won't. 
  So, we fight. 
  You're sealing yourself into the Alamo, Beth. 
  And these guys won't take prisoners either. 
  I look forward to it. 
  Stop shorting my f*cking stock, please. 
  Well, stop making it so f*cking easy. 
  Could you at least do it in after hours trading so I can f*cking fish? 
  Well, that I can do. 
  I will short your stock in after-hours trading so you can torture trout. 
  - Thank you. 
 - You're welcome. 
  You think you're up for this fight, Beth. 
  You have no idea how wrong you are. 
  Well, right back at you. 
  You are the trailer park. 
  I am the tornado. 
  [SIGH] 
  [MUSIC] 
  - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
  How was your first day? 
  [SIGH] 
  Boyd Nelson died. 
  The horse breeder? 
  I didn't really know him. 
  He was a dreamer. 
  When those dreams didn't come true he became... 
  He was an angry, angry guy. 
  The lien-holder's foreclosing on his ranch. 
  Only thing he has worth anything is about brood mares, some babies. 
  I was thinking maybe I could round them up, take them down to Billings, put them in a sale. 
  Try to help his family out. 
  That is, if it's a family worth doing it for. 
  His wife's a good woman. 
  Better than Boyd deserved, that's for sure. 
 
 
 
  I'm sorry for her. 
  There's a bit of a risk, if the bank were to find out. 
  Bank's not your problem. 
  Your problem is the people. 
  Do what's best for them. 
  That's the job. 
  You saying I should do it? 
  Not saying anything. 
  Not my decision to make. 
  Well, if do, I'm gonna need your help. 
  Once you make the decision, I'll do whatever you want. 
  [MUSIC] 
  Fellas, thanks for helping out. 
  How do you plan on doing this? 
  Rip, have you figured out how to do this without all of us getting trampled? 
  Best we came up with, sir, is like, "f*ck it", you know? 
  Let's get up there fast as we can and just chase those sons of bitches down the mountain. 
  f*ck it. 
  That's your plan, too? 
 f*ck it? 
  It's gonna be a sh1t show no matter what we do. 
  May as well do it fast. 
  Less time for things to go wrong. 
  Your logic is so flawed, son, it... 
  Hell, it almost makes sense. 
  - Great. 
 - [LAUGHTER] 
  All right. 
  f*ck it. 
  [MUSIC] 
  [RUMBLING] 
  [MEN SHOUTING] 
  Come on! 
  Yahoo! 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  I thought for sure someone was going to the hospital. 
  I thought someone was dying. 
  You know, I've got half a mind to run up that hill and do it again. 
  [MUSIC] 
  - [BEEP] 
 - Attorney General on line three. 
  Attorney General? 
  Line three. 
  Is this AG Stewart or AG elect Reid? 
  It's newly appointed AG Dutton. 
  Jamie? 
  I just thought you should hear from me directly, as the highest ranking law enforcement officer in the state, that my office is available for anything that you might need. 
  If there are any unresolved issues that need resolving. 
  Can you think of anything, Randy? 
  No. 
  No, there's no unresolved issues. 
  I'm glad to hear it. 
  Who'll be the new livestock commissioner? 
  Kayce. 
  [SIGHS, CHUCKLES] 
  How in the hell did you manage all of this, Jamie? 
  You know, I ask myself that same question. 
  To be honest with you, Randy, I think I just willed it to happen. 
  Let me know if there's something I can will for you. 
  Will do. 
  You're welcome. 
  Thank you. 
  Any time. 
  [MUSIC] 
  You weren't kidding. 
  What are they? 
  Mamas and babies. 
  Think you can move them all? 
  Will you sell them as a package? 
  I prefer it. 
  Hell, I can sell three hundred in a package with a phone call. 
  How y'all doing? 
  Our dad died. 
 How do you think we're doing? 
  I'm sorry. 
  Everybody's sorry. 
 And it don't make no difference. 
  Mrs. 
 Nelson? 
  - She's inside. 
 - Thank you. 
  Oh, my word, this is hot. 
  It's burning right through these oven mitts. 
  Carolyn, this is Kayce Dutton. 
  - Mrs. Nelson... 
 - Thank you. 
  How much did you get for them? 
  A little over sixteen thousand. 
  Was hoping to get more, but... 
  Should help with the funeral. 
  This is the funeral. 
  I ain't spending a dime burying him. 
  That coward can rot where he lays. 
  [MUSIC] 
  Cowboys and dreamers. 
  Why I only love cowboys and dreamers I will never understand. 
  They've put me through hell from the first kiss. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  And knowing me, I'll probably marry another one. 
  Hey, let's get those potatoes back in the oven. 
  You a cowboy? 
  Yeah, I am. 
  My daddy was a cowboy. 
  I'm gonna be a cowboy, too. 
  [MUSIC] 
  It's not bad. 
 You all right? 
  Which bunk is yours, Jimmy? 
  In the back in the right up top. 
  I don't think the top one's happening. 
  Anyone in the bottom bunk? 
  At the moment, actually, no. 
  How many wranglers does the Yellowstone have? 
  Ten or eleven. 
  Usually a couple floating in and out. 
  Yeah, one of the wranglers is a girl. 
 Woman. 
  Lady. 
 Kind of. 
  Laramie. 
  Hey! 
  They guys are gonna be back in a minute. 
  If they catch you drinking their beer, they're gonna... 
  They're gonna what? 
 What are they gonna do?
