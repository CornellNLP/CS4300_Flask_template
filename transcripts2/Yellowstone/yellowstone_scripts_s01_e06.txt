 It's okay. 
 You remember me? 
 Yeah. 
 It's all right. 
 It's all right. 
 That's it. 
 That's it. 
 Good boy. 
 Good boy. 
 Let's get you a drink. 
 Whoa. 
 Hey. 
 Easy. 
 Easy, bear. 
 Easy, bear... 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa. 
 Hey! 
 Whoa! 
 Hey, bear! 
 Get out of here! 
 Hey! 
 Get out of here! 
 Sorry, son. 
 You could get in trouble in a church. 
 You stood your ground, though, for once. 
 I ain't used to seeing you off my dad's leash. 
 - What's that? 
 - I didn't stutter. 
 Go ahead. 
 Come on. 
 Go ahead. 
 You still can't take a punch, though. 
 Where the f*ck you going? 
 Ah, there's work to be done. 
 You know what work is, don't you? 
 Course you don't. 
 You got your wife for that. 
 By the way, welcome home. 
 Only this wasn't a dream, it was the biggest fish I ever caught. 
 You're up early. 
 Tate has school. 
 So do I. 
 Go on and brush your teeth. 
 We gotta go. 
 You drink coffee? 
 I'm a teacher. 
 We live on it. 
 There's breakfast up at the house if you've got time. 
 We don't. 
 Well, I... 
 I brought this for Kayce. 
 Oh, he left early. 
 He's working on your horse. 
 Yeah, needs a lot of work. 
 Can someone give him a ride back? 
 I can't be late. 
 We'll get him figured out. 
 Thanks for staying last night. 
 Good to have you here. 
 Why do they do it? 
 The brand. 
 Why do the cowboys do that? 
 Well, they... 
 They don't all do it. 
 Just the ones that got a second chance. 
 I guess that's the way they prove they're to be trusted. 
 Is that why you did it to Kayce? 
 Couldn't trust him? 
 Hey. 
 Why don't you, uh... 
 Why don't you run to the house and grab a big, fat donut  so your growling stomach don't drive your mom nuts on the way home? 
 Can I get the biggest donut? 
 Biggest one in there, buddy. 
 Go. 
 I'm afraid that's a longer conversation. 
 Well, if I'm gonna be a part of this family,  I need to understand it. 
 I need to understand why he hates you so much. 
 He disobeyed me one too many times. 
 Disobeyed you how? 
 He told me he got some girl he barely knew pregnant,  and he was gonna marry her. 
 So it was because of me. 
 I told him to take you to the clinic  and not let you leave until you had an abortion,  and he wouldn't do it. 
 So you had those cowboys brand him? 
 No, Monica, that I... 
 That I did myself. 
 Okay. 
 I understand now. 
 Thank you for your honesty. 
 Pick one yet? 
 Hard to tell which one's the biggest. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 They're all pretty fat. 
 How about we line them up in a row,  and then the biggest will be easier to spot then. 
 You can do that? 
 Yeah. 
 Grandson, you can... 
 You can do whatever you want. 
 Came here to escape work, babe. 
 Oh, not working. 
 This is fascinating. 
 Did you know the livestock association has its own police force? 
 Oh. 
 Hey, remember that thing on CNN  about the, the shootout over cattle on an Indian reservation? 
 Look at this. 
 This is the guy. 
 That's great, babe. 
 I feel like I'm reading about crooked cops in f*cking Queens. 
 - This is the same thing. 
 - Now you're working. 
 Yeah, damn right I am. 
 There's a beautiful property just south of the Yellowstone. 
 Two hundred and thirty acres, Live Water. 
 Does it border the Yellowstone? 
 It's about a mile down the road. 
 Oh, it's gotta border the Yellowstone. 
 - Do you see all these lots for sale? 
 - Yep. 
 What is "Paradise Valley Development"? 
 That's Dan Jenkins' planned living community. 
 It's not what you're looking for. 
 Twenty, thirty-acre lots,  but there's no power on that side of the valley. 
 And its zoned commercial, so there's no telling what... 
 Could you print me out a plat map? 
 Thank you. 
 This is what I need. 
 All of those lots will be bank-owned within a year. 
 Dan Jenkins lost the water source he was using to generate power. 
 How do you lose water? 
 John Dutton rerouted the river. 
 - He rerouted the river? 
 - Yeah. 
 It will cost between 15 to 25 million to get power down there. 
 You don't want one of those lots. 
 Trust me. 
 They're worthless. 
 I don't want one of them. 
 I want all of them. 
 If you come on my leather seats, you're walking home. 
 We're already late. 
 The meeting can't start without us, Jamie. 
 I need to go to the bathroom. 
 After you. 
 We've been waiting a long time for this, Jamie. 
 And you, what a surprise. 
 I had no idea you were interested in politics. 
 I'm not. 
 But what daddy wants, daddy gets, right? 
 Our plan is this. 
 Mike announces his decision not to run. 
 At the same time, he endorses you as his choice to succeed him. 
 Christina interned for Chris Messina in 2012. 
 Obama's campaign manager. 
 - I know who he is. 
 - Of course you do. 
 She's been staffed with us for three years  and was instrumental in our gain of five seats  in the Assembly in 2016. 
 We think she'd be a great asset to your campaign. 
 I'm really excited to get started. 
 Well, I'm happy to have you on the team. 
 Can my whore be a 6-foot fireman who loves Jesus? 
 Please? 
 The Dutton name gives you the red votes. 
 Mike's endorsement gives you the blue votes. 
 So you want me to run as an independent? 
 That opens me up to opposition from both parties. 
 And it limits the possibilities for an office beyond this one. 
 Let's just worry about winning this office for now. 
 There's a value to the independent party that didn't exist ten years ago. 
 The partisan lines are drawn so deep. 
 The only way to get anything accomplished is with a swing vote. 
 Party members don't get those. 
 It's the new trend because it benefits both parties. 
 If you run independent, run unopposed. 
 Both party chairs have pledged that. 
 So, if he's running unopposed, why does he need this little firecracker? 
 Or do these kind of perks come with the office? 
 Can I have a word with Beth alone? 
 Don't you f*ck this up for me. 
 I'm f*cking it up just for me. 
 I get the sense there's something that you would like to discuss. 
 What insight. 
 No wonder you're governor. 
 When my husband died, our son was 15. 
 He's had countless issues since. 
 Drug abuse, alcohol abuse, pretty significant gambling addiction. 
 He can't hold down a job. 
 Although, I hear that you're a highly-functioning alcoholic,  so kudos for that. 
 What I learned, painfully,  is that when a child suffers a tragedy, they stop maturing. 
 They're emotionally frozen at the age they experienced the loss,  until they accept it, which, clearly, you haven't. 
 I look at you, and I see a 14-year-old girl  who wants to bully the world. 
 But you can't bully me, Beth. 
 Bullies need to be big, and I'm bigger than you. 
 Got it? 
 Boy, do I. 
 I can't endorse you for office until you get some help. 
 You're endorsing my brother,  which shows your shrewd judge of character. 
 I don't want your endorsement. 
 That's not why I'm here. 
 Okay, Beth. 
 Fire away. 
 Men don't think like us. 
 Too simple to weigh the significance of every act. 
 My father, he just wants to forget. 
 But not you. 
 You wanna piss in every corner and make those corners yours. 
 Affairs happen in hotels, not homes. 
 You need to look closer when you look at me, Lynelle. 
 I ruin careers for a living. 
 You sleep in my mother's bed again, and I will ruin yours. 
 Ruin it. 
 Got it? 
 And tell your son to grow up. 
 He sounds like a real pussy. 
 - I love Old Man Lee's. 
 - No way. 
 - No, re... 
 - Ready. 
 - Hey, we're not going anywhere. 
 - I know. 
 I understand. 
 - We're just getting started. 
 - I can give you a ride. 
 Ah, I'll figure it out. 
 Well, the ranch is far. 
 I work for you now. 
 I'll take you anywhere you want. 
 Jamie. 
 I gotta go. 
 I gotta go. 
 Just Jamie. 
 I'll be in my office, then court. 
 I'll be right outside the door if you need me. 
 Looks like that's gonna work out. 
 Yeah, she seems great. 
 Well, I'm hoping it really works out, Jamie. 
 A 36-year-old bachelor running for office raises a lot of questions. 
 You want us to pretend to be a couple? 
 No. 
 It looks like it's happening organically. 
 That's a good thing. 
 Let's talk about something else. 
 Some members of the Livestock Association  have raised some health concerns regarding your father. 
 Health concerns? 
 Like-like what? 
 Like cancer. 
 That's... 
 That's, uh... 
 I think I would know. 
 Would you? 
 I wouldn't listen to the rumor mill at the Cattleman's Association. 
 Well, I don't pay much attention to that,  except when one of the association member's sons is a oncologist. 
 Now, I would like to think... 
 Wait, do you need a ride? 
 - Um, no, thanks. 
 - Sorry. 
 Wanna go again? 
 - Let's go. 
 - No, no, no. 
 I think we got it out of our system. 
 For now. 
 My job is to protect this family, and you are the worst thing for it. 
 You made your choice, Kayce. 
 Now you stand by it. 
 Don't come back now. 
 You wanna do something for your father,  you do that. 
 'Cause I'll be honest with you,  I'm getting tired of burying your secrets. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I'm thinking she can't be controlled. 
 I could've told you that. 
 Second thoughts on Jamie, too? 
 Well, Jamie's a politician and a realist. 
 That's not the office I'm thinking about. 
 John's making bad decisions. 
 The way he handled the BLM issue was reckless. 
 The way he covered it up was more reckless. 
 Asking me to consider his daughter for any public office? 
 He's just not adapting. 
 If anything, he's regressing. 
 He's acting like it's 1985, and no one's looking over our shoulder. 
 Supporting another candidate for Livestock Commissioner  is the nuclear option, Lynelle. 
 You obviously lose the crossover votes he provides. 
 You make an enemy out of your new AG. 
 No, you'd have to stick around. 
 Don't put me in that position. 
 All right, let's just not jump to any conclusions. 
 But if we backed someone else, who would that someone be? 
 Let's think about that. 
 Why can't we just live with grandpa? 
 Because our home is here. 
 I like his home better. 
 Our home sucks balls. 
 Tate, where do you learn that kind of language? 
 School. 
 Probably better I shouldn't go there from all the bad things I learn. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Wonder what cuss word I'm gonna learn today. 
 Nice try, kid. 
 Yeah, come on! 
 Fight! 
 Fight! 
 Fight! 
 Fight! 
 This way, out back. 
 Come here. 
 Hold my hand. 
 Let's go. 
 They're fighting. 
 Hey, look at me. 
 Stay right here, okay? 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Stop it! 
 Stop it... 
 Go, go, go, go! 
 Move! 
 Move! 
 Mama! 
 Mama! 
 Mama! 
 Hello? 
 This is him. 
 Wha... 
 Where is she? 
 No, I'll be... 
 I'll be right there. 
 Wanna talk about the bruise? 
 - Fell off the horse. 
 - Yeah. 
 That a fact? 
 - Son, there's... 
 - I don't wanna hear it. 
 - I'm not trying... 
 - I don't wanna hear it. 
 Well, God damn it, maybe you need to hear it, son,  because every day, it's something new with you. 
 It could've happened at any school, anywhere. 
 But it didn't, did it? 
 It happened at hers. 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 Anywhere's fine. 
 Just let me out here. 
 Well, there's a spot... 
 Stop the f*cking truck! 
 Are you okay? 
 Well, I got a pretty good headache going. 
 Any dizziness, nausea, saying things that don't make sense,  - straight to the hospital. 
 - Yes, ma'am. 
 Can I have one day without a crisis, God? 
 Please, just one f*cking day. 
 How bad? 
 You tell me. 
 - What's up, bud? 
 - How busy are you, Carl? 
 Well, compared to what? 
 Hold on. 
 Can I just have one f*cking minute to myself here? 
 Please? 
 I need a break. 
 I'll be off by 5:00. 
 All right, I'll meet you then. 
 What? 
 No, not yet. 
 You and I are gonna have a conversation. 
 What? 
 Talk to me about cancer. 
 Okay. 
 What would you like to know? 
 For a start, how long have you had it? 
 Well, I don't have a cancer. 
 I had a tumor in my colon. 
 It was removed. 
 Nice, uh... 
 Nice to see you two exhibit some real emotion. 
 This isn't funny. 
 These aren't the kind of secrets that you can keep. 
 Yeah, well, it doesn't seem like much of a secret. 
 That could be its own problem. 
 Well, lucky I have you to take care of it. 
 You come with me. 
 You embarrassed me, Beth. 
 She's not who you think she is. 
 She's exactly who I think she is. 
 She's just not who you think she is. 
 She's my friend. 
 Your friend, too, if you bothered to notice. 
 It's not casual to her. 
 Well, I don't know what to tell you, Beth. 
 If the governor's not good enough for you, please explain your standards. 
 My standard is my mother. 
 Now, you're the only child I have tough enough to take this advice. 
 Now, you need to man up, you understand? 
 You need to man up, be a part of the solution,  or go back to f*cking Utah! 
 And don't you ever mention your mother to me again. 
 You forfeited that right a long time ago. 
 I gotta say, Dan, you did real good here. 
 Never thought it would turn out like this. 
 A community by the park would've been better. 
 You see, people don't need to drive to work anymore. 
 Work is where you open your laptop. 
 
 
 
 That means people get to live where they want. 
 It's the first time in history that option's become available  to anyone but the world's elite. 
 I'm not the bank, Dan. 
 You don't have to sell me. 
 Let's talk about this problem. 
 Getting a little pushback from the good old boys, huh? 
 No, no, no. 
 He's more than that. 
 He has influence over almost every public office in the state. 
 Now, nothing happens in this county without his approval. 
 Tell me who he doesn't have influence over. 
 - A freshman senator... 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 A county attorney from Livingston, and half the democrats in Bozeman. 
 That's a start. 
 What about this Livestock Association? 
 Any young, ambitious rancher looking to move up? 
 Not around here, no. 
 Well, we don't look here. 
 We go to Missoula. 
 We go to Miles City or Great Falls,  somewhere that doesn't know Bozeman and doesn't care. 
 I'll start to look. 
 You don't beat this guy in a stand-up fight. 
 You gotta kill him with a thousand little cuts. 
 I'll reach out to environmental organizations. 
 This close to the park,  there's bound to be threatened species on his property. 
 Was that river he moved  a spawning ground for the Yellowstone cutthroat? 
 Can we sue to place trail cameras on his property  to monitor migrating wolverines, pine martens... 
 Both endangered in this area. 
 - What? 
 - I forgot how good you are. 
 Baby, when you pay the Armageddon rate, God sends you an angel. 
 What we need to find is the face of this fight. 
 - Can't be you. 
 - Well, who else could it be? 
 I'm not bringing in any partners. 
 Not partners,  but understand you could find the cure for Alzheimer's,  these people would still hate you. 
 You're a billionaire from California. 
 Half of Bozeman is billionaires from California. 
 They're all wishing they weren't. 
 Deep down, y'all wish you were cowboys. 
 It's the white version of a brother from Beverly Hills  pretending he's hard. 
 No. 
 We need to find a face. 
 It isn't yours. 
 Use my face. 
 I, for the past month,  have been doing what you're doing right now,  and I came to the same conclusion:  I can't beat them alone. 
 Tom Rainwater,  Chairman of the Confederated Tribe at Broken Rock. 
 Aren't you gonna introduce yourself to me? 
 What for? 
 You aren't the one calling the shots. 
 I like the way you think. 
 She calls the shots, I approve them, 'cause I write the checks. 
 Not anymore. 
 I'll do that, too. 
 - Walk me through your ideas. 
 - No, no, no, Melody. 
 This doesn't sound like strategy. 
 This sounds like business, business he walks me through. 
 You have a subdivision that you can't build  because you have no power source. 
 I can give that to you. 
 That's a $60 million build. 
 I'll get a loan. 
 You'll get a loan to help build a subdivision? 
 The loan is not for a subdivision. 
 It's for a casino. 
 I'll lease you the land for a dollar. 
 Won't give me the loan for a lease. 
 We have to own the land. 
 - How much land do you need? 
 - Dan. 
 Forty acres for the casino. 
 I'd like 75 for a hotel and parking. 
 Dan. 
 You can choose a location. 
 You can have design approval. 
 I do have minimum square foot requirements for the casino and parking,  and I have minimum room requirements for the hotel. 
 But I finance all construction. 
 I will build your roads, in and out. 
 Water, power, sewage,  I finance all infrastructure,  and then lease your subdivision access  to the infrastructure for one percent of the casino revenue. 
 Why would I agree to that? 
 Because I'm giving you 15% revenue as payment for the land. 
 Well, how big is the casino? 
 Two hundred and seventy-five thousand square feet on the casino floor,  400 rooms in the hotel. 
 That's a $200 million build, huh? 
 - Three hundred. 
 - Dan. 
 A word? 
 Excuse me. 
 Don't agree to anything. 
 I need to do some digging. 
 Well, dig away, but that's the deal of the century. 
 It's too good to be true. 
 Well, he's too desperate to lie. 
 When you dig him up, you'll understand. 
 That's the enemy of my enemy,  and John Dutton has no greater enemy than that man right there. 
 Tom. 
 Great. 
 Well, would your friend care to join us? 
 Well, he's a little occupied right now. 
 I wanna put it in. 
 I'll let you put it in. 
 - Then why are you holding it? 
 - There you go. 
 - Take these. 
 - I'm giving it to you. 
 Then give it to me. 
 Do I have your permission to teach this boy some manners? 
 Yes. 
 - You lied! 
 - Come with me. 
 Your mother will not punish you, because she is your mother. 
 Your father's whole childhood was punishment. 
 Because of that, he does not trust himself to do it in a good way,  so he doesn't do it at all. 
 That brings us to you. 
 You need to be a good kid because you want to be a good kid. 
 Because your parents do not have the heart to make you into a good kid. 
 I did not have the heart with my grandson. 
 And now he's gone. 
 Does that make sense? 
 Didn't figure it would. 
 It was worth a shot, though. 
 Do you think the pasta's ready? 
 A few more minutes. 
 Let's go back inside. 
 Look, a spaceship. 
 You feeling any better? 
 Well, the kid can throw a punch. 
 I'll say that. 
 How many fingers am I holding up? 
 Seventeen. 
 Hey, do you think we're doing the right thing? 
 Tate has the opportunity to live like 99% of the country will never understand. 
 I understand it. 
 Look how I turned out. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Hey, don't fall asleep. 
 Okay. 
 What the hell is that thing doing? 
 No clue. 
 Get inside. 
 Is it from space? 
 - It's a drone, son. 
 - What's a drone? 
 Know a guy on the Flathead said treasure hunters fly them all over,  looking for a place to dig. 
 It ain't gonna find no treasure around here. 
 My dinosaur! 
 Tate, stop. 
 Tate! 
 Tate, stop. 
 Stay behind me. 
 White people just f*cking take, take, take. 
 - I don't mean you. 
 - I know what you mean. 
 Cut him off! 
 Leave the shotgun here. 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Stop the car. 
 Stop the car! 
 I just wanna talk! 
 Stop... 
 I had him! 
 I was aiming for the tire. 
 Yeah? 
 And then what? 
 This has been one of those days, Carl,  when I question my children's commitment to pay for the nursing home. 
 No nursing home for me. 
 When I get too old or too sick,  I'm headed to the top of a mountain, with a really good bottle of whiskey. 
 Could never do it, Carl. 
 I'll die 95 in a nursing home, do it with a smile. 
 Just in case my kids wanna see me one more time. 
 But they won't, John. 
 That's the deal. 
 You're dead to them the day they put you in there. 
 Ah, shoot. 
 What's the matter? 
 I'm out of flies. 
 Yeah, well,  I lost my fly 20 minutes ago, Carl. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Got a boat coming. 
 She sure had a thing for you. 
 I gotta hide him before he comes back! 
 Tate, be careful. 
 Supper's ready! 
 Doing okay, baby? 
 Monica! 
 Check her pulse. 
 Park it right here. 
 Please, God. 
 Don't take them both. 
 Can you find me something I haven't lost? 
 Come on, baby. 
 Stay with us. 
 Come on. 
 Don't leave us. 
 Don't look if you don't wanna see  If it makes you sick to watch him bleed  Forgiveness don't grow on trees  Don't look if you don't wanna see  Don't look if you don't wanna see  If it makes you sick to watch him bleed  Forgiveness don't grow on trees  Don't look if you don't wanna see
