 I got you another. 
 - Mornin'. 
 - Eh. 
 What does the day bring us? 
 No tellin', Rip, but I know... 
 I know this is the best it'll be. 
 Well, I guess it's all kind of downhill  from here, huh? 
 - Let's go to work. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Whoa, whoa! 
 - Hey, let's go! 
 Jimmy, get your sh1t together. 
 Start to move now. 
 Come on. 
 Yep. 
 I'll keep you posted, but now... 
 Yeah, I don't know. 
 Seal this whole area off. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 How big of an area are you talking about here? 
 Look, I gotta get a drill in the ground today. 
 I don't think you're gonna be drilling today. 
 Look, for all we know,  these bones are goddamn relics. 
 You said the hole was new. 
 Doesn't mean the bones are. 
 If you thought these bones were old, you'd have never called. 
 You'd have sold 'em on eBay and kept on digging. 
 Hey, you know what? 
 I'm calling our attorney. 
 - This is bullshit. 
 - Yeah, knock yourself out. 
 You know what? 
 f*ck that. 
 All right, this is a violation of our lease agreement. 
 For all you know, these are the bones  of some Mormon that got lost and somebody scalped! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey. 
 Looks pretty f*ckin' fresh to me. 
 How big an area you want sealed? 
 To the f*cking horizon. 
 Rip, you got stragglers in the timber. 
 We're coming at you. 
 We got stragglers in the trees. 
 I want you to come with me. 
 - Uh... 
 - I ain't asking  your f*cking permission, Jimmy, I'm telling you. 
 Now let's go. 
 - Keep up, let's go. 
 - I thought you said  running the horses makes the cattle nervous? 
 What do you think that chopper's doing? 
 Now let's go, keep up. 
 Come on. 
 We got a pretty good group down there, let's... 
 Let's swing 'em out wide. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 Don't cut your horse. 
 Get up! 
 Somebody get Jimmy's horse. 
 Lloyd! 
 Help shit-for-brains with his horse. 
 Start drivin' em this way, God damn it! 
 Hey... 
 Hey, hey. 
 Hey... 
 Get a hold of the rein before you take the rope off. 
 Okay. 
 At least you're starting to walk like a cowboy. 
 I don't think I'm cut out for this. 
 Nobody is, Jimmy. 
 It's gotta be cut into you. 
 Where's your hat? 
 Well, find it. 
 Don't come back without it. 
 They'll never let you live it down. 
 Oh... 
 Where are the kids? 
 Watchin' a show. 
 You want me to finish all this? 
 Looks like a suicide. 
 It's not what it is. 
 No job, three kids, no food. 
 And my dad certainly can't take care of 'em. 
 We can't. 
 Samantha's parents, they do pretty good. 
 They got a nice house in Seattle. 
 Only problem is, they won't speak to her. 
 Knew if she asked, they'd say no. 
 Now they can't say no. 
 It wasn't a suicide. 
 It was a sacrifice. 
 Whoa... 
 Whoa. 
 Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Right. 
 When are they coming? 
 Noon, I think. 
 It's a long drive. 
 It'll be better for them. 
 Get far away from here. 
 But for here, it won't be long before there's no one left. 
 'Course, that's been the plan since the beginning. 
 If we're gonna remain a family, we should probably leave too. 
 They win again. 
 Hey, can you do me a favor? 
 Take Tate out of here? 
 I just don't want him to watch his cousins leave. 
 He'll ask questions I don't know how to answer. 
 Where you want me to take him? 
 Just away. 
 Tate, come see your dad. 
 Hey. 
 Am I in trouble? 
 No, buddy. 
 Far from it. 
 You wanna go see your grandpa? 
 - Which one? 
 - Mine. 
 Watch her! 
 Close it up! 
 There's three more coming up, now. 
 Mr. 
 Dutton. 
 Mr. 
 Dutton! 
 Let's get that bald-faced b*st*rd. 
 Hey, Lloyd. 
 Lloyd! 
 Let's start moving these red-tag heifers  - into the trailers! 
 - Okay. 
 Uh-oh. 
 That ain't good. 
 If a horse moved beneath me like that today,  my prostate would fall on the ground  right in front of me. 
 My son's gonna have his hide for ridin' at all. 
 He's got colon cancer. 
 My boy's his doctor, and he just cut two feet  out of his colon last week. 
 Damn. 
 She's asking for Mr. Jenkins. 
 Did you tell her there was no smoking? 
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Then why  is she still smoking? 
 It's, um... 
 I... 
 I don't... 
 She made a rather compelling argument, sir. 
 - Pardon me, ma'am. 
 - Ma'am? 
 Miss. 
 "Miss" should really only be applied  to a woman younger or just reaching marrying age,  which, in the era this bullshit became common vernacular,  was around 13. 
 And since I am clearly beyond that milestone  and I'm clearly not married,  the proper term for me would be "maiden."  But if you call me "maiden," Alfred,  I'm gonna stab you in the eye with this f*ckin' fork. 
 We have a no smoking policy. 
 Really? 
 Well, looks to me like the whole place is smoking, Alfred. 
 Unless the policy's just against me smoking,  which I find hard to believe because I've never been here before. 
 - What do you want? 
 - To make a scene. 
 You ready to watch that happen? 
 I'll get Mr. 
 Jenkins for you. 
 I'd appreciate it. 
 Hey, tattle-tale. 
 Bring me another. 
 And she wondered why I wanted her to move away. 
 She's not wondering anymore. 
 Anything I can do, just please let me know. 
 Hey, John. 
 What'd we say, Emmett? 
 That stallion was giving you a hell of a time,  but you didn't give an inch. 
 I never do. 
 How you feelin', John? 
 Hungry and tired. 
 I mean long term. 
 'Cause we need a Commissioner that got clear eyes. 
 It's... 
 It's a big fight ahead of us, John. 
 Who told you? 
 Mickey said you got cancer. 
 Had, Emmett. 
 They cut it out. 
 We're not young men, John. 
 Maybe a younger man should step in. 
 Well, name the man. 
 You know him, Emmett? 
 No, I don't either. 
 So you're stuck with me. 
 - So you're saying he got it all? 
 - Yeah, he got it all. 
 Then we don't have to talk about this again. 
 To anyone. 
 You understand? 
 You make sure Mickey understands it too. 
 How you doin'? 
 Don't know, yet. 
 This day keeps punching. 
 You? 
 Wife wanted me out of the house. 
 I've run out of ideas of how to entertain this one. 
 Thought you might have a few. 
 I might. 
 How's the stallion treating you? 
 It's a gift that keeps on giving. 
 Looks like you're mine. 
 What do you want to do? 
 I wanna go to the river. 
 Come on. 
 Oh. 
 Death weren't everywhere these days,  I'd say it likes you. 
 Or your husband, at least. 
 Is he here? 
 Went into town, I think. 
 Hmm. 
 You know, the newspapers write about all these random acts of violence. 
 But they're not random. 
 Not one. 
 They're all connected. 
 Like that. 
 To look at it, there's no pattern. 
 No beginning, no end. 
 It's easy to think a random thing like that  just became. 
 All on its own. 
 But you and I know different. 
 We know a spider's behind it all. 
 Have Kayce come see me when he gets home. 
 - There you go, make sure they touch. 
 - How's that? 
 All right, well... 
 Wood, right? 
 Can't have a fire without wood. 
 Little twigs first. 
 Nah, little bigger than that. 
 There you go. 
 Now just put all that in the middle. 
 We're gonna need a little bit more, though. 
 There you go. 
 Look who's getting the hang of it. 
 Now we need bigger pieces. 
 I think you should carry the big ones. 
 Well, I'm supervising. 
 You gotta do it. 
 It's your fire. 
 Tate. 
 Tate! 
 Tate! 
 Tate! 
 Tate! 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 This is the best fire starter in the world. 
 No, Tate... 
 Tate! 
 Sit up for me. 
 Okay. 
 - Ah! 
 - I know, buddy. 
 I know. 
 Gotta get you warm. 
 Good thing we built a fire pit. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, here we go. 
 We got Walsh Ranch, yellow ear tags. 
 And Bar-3 ranch, we got blue tags and brandin'. 
 Then the Parker ranch, we got... 
 Let's go. 
 Well, look who decided to show up. 
 You have a nice ride, Jimmy? 
 Open the gate, Fred. 
 ...Bar-3 ranch. 
 Wonder which one's his mama? 
 Gee, I f*cking wonder, Jimmy. 
 Put it in the pen. 
 Red, get on your horse. 
 That's as cowboy as it gets, right there, Jimmy. 
 Hup, hup. 
 You're a f*cking dipshit, Fred. 
 You feeling saucy, boy? 
 Stay the f*ck down. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Ah! 
 Don't do this, man. 
 I'm gonna make it sting this time. 
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 - Okay, all right. 
 - We're done here. 
 - You got him. 
 - No, no, no, come on. 
 - No, Jimmy! 
 It's on you, Fred. 
 Think you proved your point, Fred. 
 Yeah, I think he's got it. 
 I told him to f*ckin' stay down. 
 Fred! 
 f*ck! 
 What's the rule about fighting, Fred? 
 You wanna fight somebody, you come fight me! 
 I'll fight you all goddamn day! 
 I'm the one that started it! 
 It wasn't him, it was me! 
 You see this? 
 You know what this means? 
 This means "don't f*cking touch," Fred! 
 Don't f*cking touch. 
 Now you guys can go get the supper that you didn't earn. 
 Get out of here. 
 Get out of here. 
 I didn't start it, he said it. 
 Ah... 
 If you ever hit a branded man again, I'll kill you, Fred. 
 I'll kill you, Fred. 
 These guys, they just work here, Jimmy. 
 You'll see a thousand of them come and go. 
 But not us. 
 We die here. 
 This is your family. 
 We're your family. 
 All right. 
 Jimmy's no longer cleaning the stalls, Fred. 
 That's your job. 
 No. 
 No, I ain't cleaning no goddamn stall. 
 Lloyd? 
 Give this man his week's wages, and get this piece of sh1t off the ranch. 
 Get to the f*ckin' bunkhouse. 
 They come and go, Jimmy. 
 But not us. 
 - I gotta wash up. 
 - Mmm-mmm. 
 No, no. 
 You go have your supper, and you make them look at you. 
 Now go on. 
 - What do you want? 
 - I need a horse. 
 They ain't back yet. 
 Oh, God. 
 What happened? 
 Oh. 
 Well, I... 
 I got in a sword fight. 
 
 
 
 Yeah, I was riding... 
 Riding through the forest, and this goblin jumped out  with a dadgum sword and he stuck me right in the belly. 
 What did you do? 
 Well,  on this particular day, I happened to have a sword of my own. 
 So I jumped off my horse and pulled out that sword  and stuck him right in the belly. 
 Boy, am I gonna miss you. 
 Where are you going? 
 Nowhere, but... 
 You're gonna grow up and I'm gonna grow old, and... 
 I'll just be this old, shriveled raisin in the corner  telling you stories you don't want to hear. 
 But that's life. 
 That's the way of it. 
 We'll always have today. 
 Yeah. 
 Bastards can't take that away from us. 
 Nope. 
 What's a b*st*rd? 
 What are you doing? 
 You came up to me, remember? 
 - My family lives here. 
 - Mmm. 
 Well, I guess we should go somewhere else. 
 Look, I, uh... 
 I know I caught you off-guard, so if you wanna slip around a corner  and pop a Viagra, I know a great bar we can go  to wait for it to kick in. 
 Meet me out front. 
 Mr. 
 Jenkins is taking care of your drinks. 
 I wouldn't let that cocksucker pay for my funeral. 
 Your dad is gonna be real mad at me. 
 And he's got every right to be, so I don't want you  sticking up for me, no matter what he says. 
 - You understand? 
 - Mmm-hmm. 
 - But you saved me. 
 - I saved you  from the situation I put you in. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 And you won't till your father gets here. 
 Cleaned it best I could, but he needs stitches. 
 What happened? 
 I fell in the river, and Grandpa saved me. 
 Why was he near a river? 
 Come on, buddy. 
 I had to get rid of a wrangler today. 
 Yeah? 
 - Which one? 
 - Fred. 
 - What'd he do? 
 - Ah, he worked over Jimmy. 
 Well, good riddance. 
 I always took him for a bully. 
 Yeah, that and a loudmouth too. 
 You know, I could drop him at the bus station,  but he's been here a while. 
 He's seen a lot. 
 Train station's where I'd leave him. 
 Well, you run the bunkhouse, Rip. 
 Do what's best for the ranch. 
 Replace him with someone who wears a brand. 
 You got a cowboy in mind? 
 Do it like my daddy did it, get somebody from the prison. 
 All right. 
 Just, uh... 
 Uh, anyone? 
 Brand isn't something you earn, it's something  you live up to. 
 Think you deserved it when I gave it to you? 
 Look at you now. 
 Boy okay? 
 Boy's fine. 
 You okay? 
 I almost lost him. 
 Mmm. 
 Well, it's hard to measure "almost," because "almost" doesn't matter. 
 Yeah, well, isn't that wise. 
 Who told you that? 
 You did, sir. 
 I'll have your, uh, supper waiting. 
 Came from the country  After the bare-knuckle fighter  Yeah, I'm an American  UDT seal diver  Your mind can't conceive  All the places I've been  To the ends of the earth  Hell and back again, yeah  Never been the one to run away  'Round the world with a gun in my hand  You're damn right, I'm a bad m*therf*cker  Baby, I'm a frogman  Small arms fire  - Beer? 
 - Yeah. 
 You ever been to a place like this? 
 - No. 
 - It's a real tightrope for men. 
 You act too meek, the whole place will eat you alive. 
 You act too strong, whole place will test you. 
 My grandmother used to wear pants like that to church. 
 Thanks for the beer. 
 You look like you're worth a ride around the arena. 
 Yeah? 
 Think you could stay on? 
 Fistful of that hair, I guarantee it. 
 Okay, okay, you can't talk to her like... 
 Get your f*ckin' hands off me. 
 Actually, he's right. 
 You can't talk to me like that. 
 Well... 
 Better have a big pistol in that purse. 
 I do. 
 It's called my name. 
 Beth Dutton. 
 What's yours? 
 We should leave. 
 Quittin' already? 
 We're gonna get killed in here. 
 No, just you. 
 Watch this. 
 This guy here, he says he don't like the way  you're looking at me. 
 The f*ck you say, boy? 
 I didn't say anything. 
 You got something to say, God damn say it. 
 I have nothing to say. 
 How does a pussy like you end up with someone like her? 
 He ain't got me yet. 
 Who you calling a pussy, huh? 
 Y'all gonna get me  - thrown in jail. 
 - Yeah. 
 Not sure this is your crowd. 
 This is why you brought me here? 
 I just wanted  to eliminate any illusion you might have about the West being won. 
 We're leaving. 
 Oh, I'll get my own ride, thanks. 
 Come, this... 
 This place'll tear you apart. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Look at you. 
 Look how broken you are, and we haven't even kissed yet. 
 I thought you'd be tougher. 
 Stay. 
 Stay with your people. 
 Best of luck. 
 Baby, I'm a frogman  Hey, hey, hey  - Hey, Mama. 
 - Hi, baby. 
 I fell in the river. 
 - I heard. 
 - It doesn't even hurt, Mama. 
 They gave me a shot right in my face. 
 You're such a big boy. 
 Don't be too hard on yourselves. 
 Kids fall, they get up. 
 God made 'em like rubber for a reason. 
 You could have lost him. 
 Stupid... 
 Boy by a river... 
 You lost him. 
 f*ck this ranch. 
 f*ck John Dutton and f*ck you. 
 Where we goin'? 
 Train station. 
 The f*ck are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 This ain't no goddamn train station! 
 Sure it is. 
 - A long, black train. 
 - No... 
 Well, I was barely 13  When the company man  Tried to dig my daddy's grave  Cold and the grip of death stinging pain  He fought like hell to keep the wolves away  Open the glove box. 
 In front of our son? 
 Let's face it, baby. 
 We're out of places to hide. 
 For the next few years, Dad was sick as a dog  But he made a recovery just to spite the odds  Settlement came and we moved out of town  Get out of the vehicle  with your hands up. 
 Where the sky isn't heavy with refinery clouds  Yeah, he's still alive, he's doing good  He's in his 50s, but the money's running out  He's pinching for pennies  Turn around until I tell you to stop. 
 Stop. 
 Walk backwards towards the sound of my voice. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 - It's okay. 
 - Stop. 
 Go ahead and get down on both knees. 
 - Where's Daddy? 
 - Put your hands  on the concrete in front of you. 
 Walk your body out so it's flat. 
 Cuffing. 
 Well, the night is my companion  And the highway is my home  You're in my seat. 
 Get out of here. 
 - Sorry. 
 - Yeah. 
 Got me seeking for one last beacon  Kinda sh1t you get into tonight? 
 When you go to war with someone, Rip, you want 'em emotional. 
 You want 'em angry. 
 The more they feel, the less they think. 
 But I guess you know that already, don't ya? 
 I wish I had a little more him in me  This is almost like a music festival. 
 Make it easier going on living  - You want a beer? 
 - Sure. 
 Sweet, sweet heart of mine  I'm gonna break again a million times  Oh, is this true or gone  You look good in neon. 
 Who doesn't? 
 Well, I guess I got my bottle  I still hold it all the time  But it keeps me smiling and singing  Helps me fall asleep a little better at night  They say life is like a dagger  Backstage is full of parasites  They love you and drain you of everything you own  Just to feel better about their life  Sweet, sweet heart of mine  I'm gonna break again a million times  Oh, is this true or gone? 
 Oh, have you turned to stone?
