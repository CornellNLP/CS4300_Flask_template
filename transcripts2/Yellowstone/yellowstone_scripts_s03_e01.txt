 [ birdsong ] 
 [ music ] 
 - Ride those east pastures, Kayce. 
 With all this rain, see if any of that clover came up. 
 - Yeah. It'll be easy to spot. 
 You gonna be back by tonight? 
 - Doesn't... Doesn't take long to quit something, son. 
 I'll be back by noon. 
 Let's go. 
 Here. You'll dress in the car. 
 [ engine starts ] 
 [ Tate screaming ] 
 - Hey. Hey. Tate. Tate. 
 Look at me. 
 Tate, Tate, stop. 
It's okay, it's okay. 
 Stop. 
 - Don't say it. 
 - I don't have to. 
 I can't say it any better than that. 
 - It's okay. 
 Just... Just go back to sleep, son, okay? 
 [ music ] 
 - Exactly as I told you to say it, understood? 
 - Understood. 
Trust me. 
 - Trust me? 
 [ scoffs ] 
 - He's gonna walk in here-- 
- [ knocking ] 
 - Okay, no. 
[ door opens ] 
 - Hello, John. 
 - Lynelle. 
 - I, uh... I don't know where to start. 
 - I know where to start. 
 - We had evidence that the Becks used aircraft 
 to poison cattle along the highway 89 corridor 
 south of Emigrant. 
 Upon serving a warrant based on that information, 
 we discovered additional evidence of a kidnapping-- 
 - We know all this, Jamie. 
 - Livestock agents are bound by law 
 to intervene in any active crime. 
 That duty supersedes jurisdictional boundaries. 
 - You gonna fight this, John? 
 - Are we wrong? 
 - You're not wrong. 
But it doesn't alter the lens. 
 It doesn't change the way it looks and how it looks-- 
 - Is all that matters anymore, John. 
 Six people died. 
 The door is closed, John. 
 Let's just be honest. 
 When the blanket gets pulled back on this thing, 
 and the nation knows that the family member 
 that was kidnapped was yours... 
 This stops looking like law enforcement 
 and starts looking like... 
- It looks like a feud. 
 It looks like a gross misuse of power. 
 Lynelle: We have been sitting here banging our heads 
 against a wall, and we don't have a solution. 
 - I have a solution, Lynelle. 
 You leave the blanket right where it is. 
 I'll resign as Livestock Commissioner 
 and accept full responsibility for my agents' overreach. 
 And you, you stop looking. 
 You let it go. 
 You talk about militias and human smuggling 
 and you take the credit. 
 And you leave me and my family out of it. 
 - That cleans things up on my end. 
 - This is a state issue and that's where I want it to stay. 
 - And this keeps it a state issue? 
 - It gives me what I need, yes. 
 - Great. 
 Have you thought about your replacement? 
 - Give me till next week. 
 - Thank you, John. 
 I won't forget this. 
 - I won't let you. 
 - I'm sure you won't. 
 - There was a closed door meeting with the Governor, 
 the Attorney General, Federal Officials, 
 and Livestock Commissioner John Dutton. 
 Now, Dutton's office is under intense scrutiny 
 for its use of force in multiple gun battles 
 that led to the death of both Beck brothers... 
 - How do you think this is gonna work out for him? 
 - Depends, on whether he's as smart as I think he is. 
 - I watched him. 
 In a field. 
 He had honor when most wouldn't. 
 - What are you saying? 
 - I'm saying, maybe he's not the enemy we think he is. 
 - When there's one thing that two men want, 
 they can either share it or be enemies. 
 Are you suggesting we share it? 
 - Suggesting things isn't my job, Chairman. 
 That's yours. 
 - This side looks good. 
 - This side too. 
 - You feel good turning cattle back out? 
 - It should have clovered up this last rain. 
 I think we ought to wait until July. 
 - We're running out of hay. 
 Feeding cattle all summer is no way to make a living. 
 - sh1t, we'll just do it like the old days: 
 grab a chuck wagon, bring it out here 
 and we'll babysit 'em all summer long. 
 - It's not the worst idea. 
 The f*ck? 
 - Who the f*ck are they? 
 - Y'all lost? 
 - Uh, it's a possibility. 
 Uh, is this part of the Paradise Valley Sporting Club? 
 - Wrong side of that fence. 
 - Ah. I told you. 
[ chuckles ] 
 - You all staying at the Sporting Club? 
 - Uh, they own it. 
 - Who are they? 
 - Providence Hospitality management. 
 I'm Ellis Steele. 
 my firm is representing Market Equities. 
 - We don't know what that is. 
 - They manage resort properties. 
 We watch out for their interests. 
 This your land? 
 Incredible. 
 I didn't catch your name? 
 - That's cause I didn't offer it. 
 - Fair enough. 
 We'll get out of your way. 
 You know, I can understand you being wary, 
 bunch of city folks wandering in your field. 
 I apologize. 
 Why don't you come by the resortand have dinner, on us? 
 After all, you're going to be neighbors, 
 it's best if we all get along. 
 [ chuckles ] 
 We're going this way, folks. 
 - The properties highlighted in red 
 are the ones we've purchased. 
 - How much acreage total? 
 - A little over 17,000. 
 - [ chuckles ] 
Ooh, damn. 
 Good job, Beth. 
 - It's what you pay me to do. 
 - Any of it commercially zoned? 
 - Most of the highway frontage is multi-use. 
 But the corner properties, they're commercial. 
 Why, what you thinking? 
 - I want you to hold off on the conservation easements. 
 - That income offsets our tax liability. 
 - I know, but there could be bigger income on the horizon. 
 Market Equities bought Jenkins' place. 
 Hired a hotel management group to oversee it. 
 - That was fast. 
 - The estate didn't have a choice. 
 He was losing six figures a month. 
 Bank was going to call the note. 
 - So, who is running the property now? 
 - Providence. 
 - That's a big company. 
 - It's the one you bring in when your goal is expansion. 
 And your expansion is bigger than casinos and golf courses. 
 - You heard any rumors about their plans? 
 - Probably the same as their plans in Austin and Scottsdale. 
 Beth, keep buying. 
 But every f*cking thing you can get your hands on. 
 - Will do. 
 [ country music plays ] 
 [ construction sounds ] 
 - What's wrong with the old barn? 
 - It's seven miles from this half of the ranch. 
 - Hey, Lloyd, what, uh... 
 What was that old joke about the two fat chicks 
 and the wheelbarrows? 
[ laughs ] 
 - That wasn't a joke, Jake. 
 That was you at the Cooper branding. 
 - You guys wanna hear a joke? 
 [All] 
- No. 
 - All right, check it out. 
 There's this big Texas oil guy, right? 
 Goes into this bar down at the border, 
 sits next to this vaquero and says, 
 "Hey, man, you a rancher?" 
 Vaquero says, "Yeah, I got fifty acres down by the river." 
 Big Texas oil guy says, "Oh? Oh, on my ranch, 
 "I can get in my truck in the morning, 
 and I still don't reach the front gate by sunset." 
 Vaquero sits for a second, nods, and says, 
 "Yeah, man. Yeah, I used to have a truck like that too." 
 I... 
 He was bragging about the size of his ranch, 
 and the vaquero... 
- That was almost funny. 
 - All right, I got one. 
 Y'all hear about the guy that goes to see a doctor, 
 and the doctor says, "Sorry to be the one to tell you this, 
 "but you got cancer head to toe. 
 Only have one week to live." 
 Man says, "A week?! 
Well, that's not enough time! 
 "Doc, you gotta do something. 
 I need more than a week!" 
 And the Doc thinks, he sits down and he says, 
 "I'll tell you what to do: 
 "you go find yourself a barrel racer girl 
 with two little dogs, and you marry her." 
 And the man says, "That's gonna make me live longer?" 
 And the Doc says, "No. 
 But it'll make that week feel like a f*cking eternity." 
 [ laughing ] 
 - I don't know. 
I think mine was better. 
 - Jimmy, when you're all growed up, 
 and you've actually dated a woman, 
 you'll think it's hilarious. 
 - That's it. Let's go up to the big barn. 
 You're done. 
Let's go. 
 Lloyd, let's get them mules out of the field. 
 Let's clean up that chuck wagon. 
 We're running a spike camp this summer, understand? 
 - Ethan, come on. 
 - Wait, what's a spike camp? 
 [ music playing ] 
 - It's 38 even. 
 Care to donate to the jar fund? 
 - Sure. 
 Oh, I'm good. 
 You know, you should start a "GoFundMe" page. 
 - What's that? 
 - It's, um... 
 It's a pickle jar the whole world can reach. 
 Your boy? 
 Dealing with this 
 and he still does that to you? 
 - Someone's doing it to you, too. 
 - Not anymore they're not. 
 - How... 
 How did you make him stop? 
 - My boyfriend put his head through a wall, 
 then I smashed his skull with an eight pound ashtray. 
 New boyfriend. 
 Big-ass ashtray. 
 It's just a thought... 
 [ phone rings ] 
 - Hey. 
 Kayce: What's Providence Hospitality? 
 - It's a problem. 
 - How big? 
 - They don't get any bigger. 
 Listen, don't tell Dad. 
Okay? 
 I gotta go, some asshole's standing in our river. 
 - Hey. 
 Hey! 
 - How ya doing? 
 - You're trespassing! 
 - Huh? 
 - Trespassing! 
 - What? 
 - Get out of our 
f*cking river. 
 - I can't 
That would be trespassing. 
 - This f*cking guy... 
 - I see the women in this valley 
 have gotten a lot more fashionable. 
 - Yeah? 
 I see Chippendale's changed their policy on capped teeth. 
 - What's that? 
 - It's an insult. 
 Never mind. 
 - Only an insult if I understand it. 
 - Yeah, that's not true. 
 But that's a conversation for another time. 
 That we'll never have. 
 Both sides of the river are private property. 
 - I know. 
That's why I can't get out. 
 - Well, how did you get in? 
 - My family owns a place upriver. 
 Cross Creek Ranch. 
You know it? 
 - Yeah, that's five miles upstream. 
 - I was blessed with stamina. 
 - I highly doubt it. 
 - When I played golf, I'd do 36 holes in a day. 
 I like this much better. 
 It's just like golf, but with fish. 
 You have any interest in dinner? 
 - No. 
 - I meant in general. 
 - No. 
I dine on my joy for life. 
 - Ah. 
 - Just stay off our f*cking land, okay? 
 - Yes, ma'am. 
 I'll stay off your f*cking land. 
 I promise. 
 Thanks for the talk! 
 You're the most interesting thing 
 that's happened to me today. 
 - You should analyze that. 
 - [ chuckles ] 
 - How'd it go? 
 - Like I expected. 
 It's a good trade for them. 
 They were happy to make it. 
 - How bout you? 
You happy? 
 - I never wanted that office, Beth. 
 I just... wanted the control. 
 I still have that. 
 - This might be a tougher sell. 
 - Well, lucky I got you to sell it for me. 
 - How are the fields? 
 - They're green. 
 - No clover? 
 - None that I could see. Grass is tall, though. 
 I was thinking we should run a camp up there 
 and keep an eye on 'em. 
 Oh, and there's something going down at Paradise Valley. 
 There's a bunch of suits wandering around up there when we got up there. 
 - Suits? 
 - Yeah, I was gonna get to that. 
 - Well, one problem at a time. 
 I need to name my replacement as Commissioner. 
 I'm naming you. 
 - You mean you're just gonna tell me this now? 
 After you already quit? 
 - If I told you before, you'd say no. 
 Then I couldn't quit. 
- Well, I'm still saying no. 
 - Kayce-- 
 - I ain't no politician! 
 You want a politician? 
 You've got one standing right there. 
 You got another one in the bunkhouse 
 living like a f*cking orphan. 
- Kayce-- 
 - I told you I would help you run this place, 
 and I'm doing that the only way I know how. 
 I won't do it. 
 - Can I make a suggestion? 
 - Yeah, as long as it's you. 
 - Can't be me. 
 - I need family in that office, Beth. 
 - You can have family in that office. 
 - I can't trust him. 
 All he does is prove it. 
 - You can trust him to be exactly what he is. 
 Jamie will always do what is best for himself, Dad. 
 And he will use the office to become popular with his constituents. 
 His constituents are ranchers. 
 What's good for their ranches 
 is good for ours. 
 [ music playing ] 
[ grunting ] 
 - Go, go! 
 Run, run, run, run! 
 - Go, go, go! 
 - Oh! 
- Oh, sh1t. 
 - Oh, sh1t. 
- Goddamn. 
 - Woo! 
- First time you ever got me. 
 - Jimmy. 
 - Okay, okay, okay, okay, come on. 
 - You get bucked off sh1t for a living now. 
 This'll be a piece of cake for you. 
 - Take into consideration that 
 you got to have a brain in order to get it concussed, 
 so, you'll be all right. 
 - Hey, bro, just try not to rope my dick. 
 or your mom's gonna be really pissed. 
 [ belches ] 
 - Gimme the f*cking rope. 
- That's funny. 
 - Okay, here we go. 
 - Okay. 
- On the clock. 
 - One, two... 
 - It's not personal, it's not personal. 
- Three! 
 - Jump! 
 - Ooh! 
 - That's what we call karma, bitch. 
 Karma. 
 - Your mom's gonna be really pissed. 
 - Hey, pretty boy, you're up. 
 - Uh, no, I'm good. 
 - You're good? 
 - Yeah. 
- What? 
 - He don't gotta if he don't want to. 
 - No, no, Jamie, you gotta pay your dues, bro. 
 - Yep. 
 - Hey! 
 - Rally, let's rally, let's rally. 
 - Here we go. 
- So how does it work? 
 - Spin on the Y. 
- Yep, on the Y. 
 - Okay. 
 - Here? 
 Okay. 
 No, this. 
 - There he is. 
- Bro, damn. 
 - There he is. 
 - Tell us how you feel! Show us how you feel! 
 [ chattering ] 
 [ grunts ] 
- Woo! 
 - That's how he feels. 
 - Okay, okay, I don't really understand the purpose of this, 
 but let's do it. 
 - Oh! 
 [ laughing ] 
 - Let's do it! 
On three, right? 
 [ laughing, chattering ] 
 - One, two... 
 three! 
- Take off coming! 
 [ shouting ] 
 - Ooh! 
- Oh! 
 - sh1t! 
 - What are you doing? 
 - I tried to lay it on his waist so he wouldn't go down hard. 
 - Yeah, well, you sure f*cked that up. 
 - His head? 
- Is he all right? 
 - Are you good? 
- Damn. 
 
 
 
 - When is it my turn with the rope? 
 [ laughing ] 
 - What the f*ck are you doing? 
 And why are you still awake? 
 - What, is it late? 
 - Jimmy, it's 3:30 in the morning. 
 Get a f*cking watch, will you? 
 You okay? 
- Yeah. 
 - Be careful with these idiots. 
 Ain't a brain cell between the bunch of them. 
 In one f*cking hour you have to saddle the whole barn. 
 We're pushing pairs in the morning. 
 And that means I want wall tents set up 
 and I want that chuck wagon up f*cking wind 
 or you'll be sleeping with the goddamn grizzlies. 
 And you... 
 You're supposed to keep a cap on these morons. 
 Act your f*cking age, would you, Lloyd? 
 [ groans ] 
 [ music ] 
 - Monica? 
 Is everything all right? 
 - Yeah. 
- Tate okay? 
 - Kayce's with him. 
 Doctor gave us some pills to help him sleep, but I just... 
 Don't trust pills, you know? 
 - Yeah. Me either. 
 - Anyway, I'm just... 
 I'm trying to find my way upstairs. 
 - Yeah, I know... 
 You make a left turn out of that kitchen 
 and you're in a damn maze. 
 - Ain't that the truth. 
 - You know, Monica, I never got to say I'm sorry. 
 I just sent him down there to feed his horse. 
 Trying to give him some responsibility, 
 not that it's my place, but I should've asked. 
 - It's not your fault that they took him. 
 And I can't thank you enough for bringing him back. 
 - Well, we all got him back. 
 - Kayce used to tell me what a war it was for you, 
 keeping this place. 
 When this land belonged to my people 
 a hundred and fifty years ago, 
 children were stolen and men were killed. 
 Families herded away like cattle. 
 And nothing's changed. 
 Except you're the Indian now. 
 - Maybe so. 
 - Um, Kayce said that 
 you're building a camp near the cattle. 
 - Yeah. Don't have much choice. 
 Or someone will try to kill or steal them, too. 
 - Will you do me a favor? 
 - Anything. 
 - Would you take Tate with you? 
 I can't think of a better medicine 
 than stars for a ceiling. 
 Would you do that for me? 
 - Of course. 
 - Good night. 
- Good night. 
 - Monica? 
 Stairs are back there. 
 - Thanks. 
 [ music ] 
 - All right, coming shotgun there, huh? 
 - Stick that horse back in the barn. 
 Move your gear out of the bunkhouse. 
 - Move it where? 
 - The lodge. 
 - Why? 
 - 'Cause I can't have the Livestock Commissioner 
 living in the bunkhouse. 
 I'll make the appointment official tomorrow. 
 And if you betray me again, 
 you are dead to me, son. You understand? 
 - Yes, sir. 
Thank you. 
 Dad. 
 I won't betray you. 
 You have my word. 
 - Well, we're about to find out what that's worth. 
 Kayce, you and Rip take the wranglers, 
 start pushing the herd. 
 We'll be right behind. 
 - All right, let's go. 
 - Keep an eye on him. 
 - You know I will. 
 - I'm, uh... 
 I'm sorry about the Commission. 
 It's just not me. 
 - You're my son. 
 I know exactly who you are. 
 And don't you ever be sorry for it. 
 - We're ready here, boss. 
 [ cows lowing ] 
 - Nothing prettier on this earth. 
 - It's as free as a man can be. 
 - Makes you wonder... 
 Who's gonna feed this world when there's none of us left. 
 - Nobody, Lloyd. 
 This world's just gonna go hungry. 
 - Zorro, Pedro... 
 [ music ] 
 - I'll head back to the ranch. 
 You guys good? 
 - Yeah. 
- Enjoy. 
 - This how they used to do it, Grandpa? 
 - Just like this. 
 Why don't you run up there, 
 see if you can steal some of the last kindling? 
 - They have a cease and desist order. 
 - State court has no authority here. 
 Get them out of here. 
- State court didn't issue it. 
 Circuit court out of Helena. 
 - Are you council for Chairman Rainwater? 
 - I am Chairman Rainwater. 
 - Huh. 
 Ellis Steele, my firm is representing Market Equities. 
 It would be best if you spoke through legal council. 
 - I'll speak for myself. 
 - Without council present or advising, 
 you could claim lack of capacity 
 and the court could nullify any agreement suggested or implied. 
 - Are you saying 
I'm incapable 
 of understanding you when you speak? 
 - Unclear at the moment. 
 - But I can assure you this: 
 When I'm done, 
 my client's position will be perfectly clear. 
 - Look at you guys. 
 I thought moving the class outside for a day 
 would get you off your phones, 
 but you're still staring at your tiny screens. 
 liking photos of people you've never met 
 and commenting on their lives while they comment on yours. 
 Do you have any idea what is happening 
 in the world you live in? 
 Do you think that the photo on your screen 
 has anything to do with that world? 
 The world you live in is slowly shrinking. 
 There is a tiny a group of men who are buying it 
 and stripping it naked and selling you what they extract. 
 They are raping your world and selling you what they take. 
 I mean, they sell you the water you drink, the air you breathe 
 and you line up for it like sheep. 
 They will kill your brother and steal your child 
 and pollute everything you love. 
 And you'll never notice because you're so hypnotized 
 by a world that doesn't exist. 
 [ sighs ] 
Well... 
 What a waste of my f*cking time. 
 - You know, houses are like boats: 
 they need to be Christened. 
 - Well, the thought's crossed my mind. 
 - To your new house. 
 Mmm. 
 Thank you. 
 [ music ] 
 Just kidding. 
 Oops. 
 Let me pour you another. 
 - No, no, no, you don't. 
I'll take that one. 
Come here, honey. 
 [ music continues ] 
 [ wolves howling ] 
 - Don't worry about that wolf, mamas. 
 I won't let him get to you. 
 [ cows lowing ] 
 - Dad's not back yet. 
 - Not coming back. 
 He's with the herd tonight. 
 He got the easy job. 
 [ wolf howls ] 
 [ horse whinnies ] 
 - Hey. Where are you going? 
[ chuckles ] 
 You're all right. Hm? 
 You're all right. 
 So, that wolf, he's out there 
 walking around by himself, 
 calling out to his friends 
 so they always know where he is. 
 - Cause he's scared? 
 - No. Wolves don't get scared. 
It's not in their genes. 
 They get weary. 
 They get smart. 
 - Like people. 
 - Yeah. 
Like some people. 
 - I have nightmares. 
 [ music ] 
 - Wanna talk about 'em? 
 - Well... 
 I'm in that room. 
 The floor just disappears... 
 And I fall. 
 Keep falling. 
 I scream. 
 No sound comes out. 
 No one hears me, so no one comes to help me. 
 - Know what dreams are? 
 It's your memories and your imagination 
 all mixed together in... into this soup 
 of what's real and what's made up. 
 But the thing about this soup is: 
 you can change the ingredients, Tate. 
 You can put in whatever you want to. 
 Any memory, any fantasy. 
 You can... You can be a baseball star 
 who opens Christmas presents all day long. 
 So, when you close your eyes later... 
 decide what you're gonna dream. 
 And that'll be the dream. 
 - Have you ever had a nightmare? 
 - I have this one... 
 Where I'm driving down the road 
 and there's these people pulled over. 
 I pull over to help, but... 
 They don't want help. 
 They want something else. 
 - What do they want? 
 - Doesn't matter. 
 - 'Cause you changed the ingredients. 
 - That's right, I changed the ingredients.
