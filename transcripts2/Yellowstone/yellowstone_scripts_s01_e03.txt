 Kayce, stop it. 
 He's doing what you should be doing. 
 Enjoying himself. 
 You'd think I asked you to paint a goddamn fence. 
 Well, the damn thing's scared of everything. 
 No, horse is only scared of what you're scared of. 
 You're scared of everything. 
 Now he is, too. 
 Beth, I swear to God. 
 Whole world's just waiting on you, Beth. 
 Like always. 
 What do we do? 
 Beth. 
 Get your father. 
 Let me. 
 I ride faster. 
 She did this. 
 Let her undo it. 
 You couldn't have remembered how to ride a horse. 
 If this is the last thing I see,  so be it. 
 Get your knee on his neck, Jamie. 
 Got one for you, Lee! 
 Tie me. 
 Come on. 
 Now you take over. 
 Come on. 
 Hiyah! 
 Yah! 
 Get it, get it, get it. 
 Got her? 
 Where are they? 
 Come on. 
 Come on! 
 There she is! 
 Where are they, Beth? 
 Where are they? 
 Hey, hey. 
 Are you hurt bad? 
 Are you hurt? 
 Where's your mom, Beth? 
 Where is she? 
 Where is she? 
 Where are they? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 Lee, get her back to the house. 
 Come on. 
 Come on! 
 Let's go! 
 There's no Republican running. 
 It's the right time, John. 
 Even if I let him run, it wouldn't be as a Republican. 
 He would run as an independent  and then, that way, he has something to offer both sides. 
 Take that off. 
 What? 
 That was my wife's. 
 You have to... 
 You have to take that off. 
 Sorry. 
 Wasn't gonna wear it long. 
 Stay here, son. 
 What's wrong, buddy? 
 I wanna go home. 
 Here, you want some of this? 
 Can I have some of those? 
 You don't want that garbage. 
 If it's such garbage, why do you have it? 
 I'm bigger. 
 It's not as bad for me as it is for you. 
 I've had my share of gummy bears, Dad. 
 Don't remember nothing bad happening. 
 All right. 
 Fine. 
 Don't start running around the kitchen like a ferret later,  or your mom will have both our hides. 
 Are you going back in the Army? 
 That's what you were doing. 
 Practicing for the Army, right? 
 Bills don't pay themselves, son. 
 My Lord, son, here. 
 Wipe your nose. 
 It's gonna be all right. 
 Hey. 
 It's all right, buddy. 
 I don't want you to go. 
 I don't wanna go. 
 Then don't. 
 How bad is it, Mike? 
 Place burned to the foundation, Jamie. 
 - Wow. 
 - When we said make this go away,  this isn't what we f*cking meant. 
 - We didn't do it. 
 - It stinks, Jamie,  and it smells like your father. 
 Exactly what we wanted to avoid. 
 Hey, you hired a medical examiner  - who was fired because... 
 - He quit. 
 No, he was fired. 
 Do your research, Mike,  because he had a healthy addiction to embalming fluid. 
 There's a lot of places you need to look before you look at us. 
 Everybody's hunting parachutes over here. 
 I am the last person you want talking about  improprieties to the press. 
 If you're circling wagons, you better put us in the middle of 'em. 
 From where I sit, this guy got high and blew himself up. 
 - Is that a possibility, Mike? 
 - This is why I'm not running again. 
 No, you're not running again  because I got you a partnership at the largest f*cking law firm in Helena. 
 Is it a possibility, Mike? 
 Answer my f*cking question! 
 Mike? 
 Yeah, it's possible. 
 Sounds like a simple case to me. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Mike, I gotta go. 
 What the hell? 
 Uh-uh. 
 What are you doing? 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Hey, hey! 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 You better turn around, Jamie. 
 I'm in no mood to explain why we don't have the same pee-pee. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Oh. 
 I know it's a lot for you to process, Jamie. 
 Only yesterday you were dreaming of a pen1s. 
 Yeah, the only thing on my mind is how am I gonna clean that trough. 
 Every now and then, you say something that makes me think you're smart. 
 And then I look at you and that thought fades. 
 All right, I know what this is. 
 It's a cry for help, but nobody cares to offer any, Beth. 
 Nobody. 
 Look me in the eye and tell what today is. 
 It's Thursday. 
 - You are so wrong. 
 - No, I'm not. 
 I'm the only sober person in this conversation  and the only one with a calendar on his watch. 
 - So, yeah, it's f*cking Thursday. 
 - It's the day our mother died. 
 I bet he remembers. 
 - I'll call you later. 
 - All right. 
 Take the f*cking reins. 
 Eyes down. 
 The f*ck do you want? 
 You need to go in the house. 
 The last thing I need is you telling me what I need. 
 Beth, it weren't a question. 
 Hey. 
 I'm the one thing you can't out-wrestle here. 
 Don't bet on that. 
 All right. 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 Everyone suffers today. 
 Including you. 
 Knock, knock. 
 Who's there? 
 Poop, that's who. 
 That's not how you tell 'em, son. 
 What? 
 There's laws on the reservation  that don't apply to people who don't live here,  and sometimes people come and try to take advantage. 
 Does that make sense? 
 Well, it's the truth,  and I just need to make sure this isn't one of those people. 
 What if it is? 
 Everything's gonna be all right, buddy. 
 If it's gonna be all right, why are you taking a gun? 
 Just like your mother. 
 Stay here. 
 Daddy! 
 Get back in the truck. 
 Now. 
 You all right? 
 No! 
 Come here. 
 I need you to be a big boy right now and do exactly what I say. 
 Get in there. 
 You stay in there until I get back. 
 You hear me? 
 These are bad men and I gotta go get 'em. 
 - Don't forget me. 
 - You stay in there,  no matter what. 
 Oh. 
 Help! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Can you hear me? 
 Are you hurt? 
 Can I come in there and take that tape off you? 
 You okay? 
 You kill them? 
 Good. 
 Tate. 
 Tate. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 That thing bite you? 
 I beat him to it. 
 Good. 
 Come on. 
 Piece of sh1t! 
 Can you give me a ride home? 
 - We should go to the police. 
 - What for? 
 You already punished them. 
 We can't just... 
 If you call the police, they'll want to know what happened,  and I'm not telling. 
 Ever. 
 Hand me that snake. 
 Hello... 
 Yes, he knows that you're here. 
 Okay, this is our livelihood. 
 - No, I understand. 
 - Is he in there? 
 I understand that, Your Honor. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 It is still theft. 
 - Yes, ma'am. 
 - Give me. 
 Give me the phone. 
 If you're saying no, say it to me, Margaret. 
 Then I'll tell you what "no" costs. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Write it up, she'll... 
 She'll sign it. 
 It's written. 
 It's taking threats to do what favors used to do. 
 You know, Mike is not running for re-election. 
 I think it's time. 
 I'd like to run for attorney general. 
 What do you think? 
 I think more control is not a bad thing. 
 Let me think about it. 
 You know, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna have to get... 
 I said, let me think about it. 
 Right. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What happened, baby? 
 Tell me what happened, baby. 
 Danny! 
 What happened? 
 I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure it was bad. 
 I wanted to take her to the police, but she wanted to come home. 
 Do you know who did it? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Let's go get them. 
 I already got them. 
 I just don't know what to do next. 
 Come inside. 
 Let's figure this out. 
 Stay in the truck, buddy. 
 It's a pleasure to be here... 
 It's a pleasure... 
 It's an honor to be here... 
 Honor... 
 to be here. 
 You're gonna be late. 
 Coyote. 
 It's a bad sign. 
 Yeah. 
 Put the vehicle in park and put your hands on the steering wheel. 
 Put your hands on the steering wheel. 
 Don't move. 
 - What do you want me to do? 
 - Step out of the car! 
 Call the tribal attorney. 
 Step out of the car. 
 Step out of the car. 
 Put your hands up. 
 Put your hands up. 
 Turn around until I tell you to stop. 
 Stop. 
 Interlock your fingers behind your head. 
 Go down to your knees. 
 - Cuffing. 
 - Copy. 
 Don't move this arm. 
 - Fine. 
 - How many times... 
 She doesn't want anyone to know. 
 I don't know how we're gonna keep this a secret. 
 They were white men, right? 
 Nobody notices when we die. 
 But when they die, everyone notices. 
 One thing about the Rez,  that's where things go to disappear. 
 I just have to take my son home first. 
 Meet me back here. 
 All right, come on. 
 Go to your mom. 
 What happened? 
 Are you okay? 
 I killed a snake. 
 Did you get bit? 
 Did you check him for bites? 
 He's fine. 
 He just needs a bath. 
 Go. 
 I gotta take care of something. 
 I'll be back late. 
 That's all I get? 
 What did I do to make you think you can't trust me? 
 I do trust you, babe. 
 I just don't have time right now. 
 And don't ask Tate what happened. 
 Let me tell it to you. 
 It feels appropriate to say "be careful."  It is. 
 Sir, please step this way. 
 Watch your step as you get out. 
 Face that, man. 
 Against the wall, spread your feet. 
 Wider. 
 Can you widen your stance for me? 
 - He was combative during the arrest. 
 - You lying piece of sh1t. 
 Do not move. 
 Do you understand? 
 - What's your last name? 
 - Rainwater. 
 - First name? 
 - Thomas. 
 - Did you meet with an accident? 
 - No. 
 - Assaulted? 
 - No. 
 Do you have anything that's gonna poke me, stick me or hurt me in anyway? 
 Just my heritage. 
 Hey, pop H3. 
 Hey. 
 Let's go. 
 Thank you for such a visceral reminder of what it's like to be oppressed. 
 Ah, cut the sh1t, Tom. 
 You're a Harvard MBA who interned for the PR firm  that represented the American Petroleum Institute. 
 You never missed a meal in your fat life. 
 But you're gonna miss one tonight. 
 And breakfast in the morning. 
 You're such a small man, John. 
 With such little ideas. 
 Yeah, "simple" is the word I think you're looking for. 
 You wanna steal cattle? 
 Now you get the bull, and that's all you get  till you give 'em back. 
 Say it just like that when Channel 9 gets here. 
 You think I care how many reporters they got out front? 
 This is your home, big fella. 
 This is where you're gonna crap till those cows are loaded  on the trucks and delivered to me. 
 Every one of them or I'll put you in prison. 
 You might like prison, Tom. 
 Lot of politics there. 
 This was never about cattle, John. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It was about you. 
 It's about you  and everyone like you. 
 You know, after I interned at Emerson,  I worked for Merrill Lynch in mergers and acquisitions. 
 I figured it'll take about 14 billion to buy it all. 
 All what? 
 The valley. 
 And I'm gonna buy your ranch first. 
 Right after you die,  and your children can't afford the inheritance tax. 
 And then, I'm gonna pull down every fence  and any evidence that your family ever existed  will be removed from the property. 
 It'll look like it used to,  when it was ours. 
 I will erase you from the future. 
 And then I'll do it to the next ranch  and the next,  and there's nothing that you can do to stop it. 
 See, I'm the opposite of progress, John. 
 I am the past catching up with you. 
 No. 
 
 
 
 You're a thief. 
 And you're going to prison, where the past catches up to everyone. 
 Hey. 
 I thought it over. 
 Can you send over your campaign manager  and head of the Republican party to the ranch this evening? 
 I want to start carving things out. 
 They know where the f*cking money should be, boys. 
 - Let's go down. 
 - Let's go. 
 Go! 
 Your ass is about to go down right now. 
 Whoo! 
 Whoo! 
 - Get it! 
 - There we go. 
 One more for fun. 
 Hit that. 
 Whoo! 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 You just got beat by some women. 
 You rope like sh1t. 
 - You're the one that missed. 
 - Y'all rope like sh1t. 
 I'm gonna take those women with me today. 
 And y'all can just go f*cking pack it in. 
 Can we talk for a minute? 
 Sure. 
 Ladies, you think you can go two for two? 
 - Get your ass in there, let's go. 
 - I need to ask you something. 
 I need to ask you something first. 
 Of all the days to have her here, why today? 
 Because of all the days, today's the one I want to forget the most. 
 What did you wanna ask me? 
 - I need you to stay, Beth. 
 - I already said yes. 
 I'm here as long as you need me. 
 I know. 
 I need you to stay longer, honey. 
 There's two open seats in the assembly. 
 We'll pick the weakest. 
 Jamie is the politician. 
 - I have no interest. 
 - I know. 
 That's why it's gotta be you. 
 I will never tell you no, Daddy, but, uh, gotta be honest,  I'm not sure I'll withstand the vetting. 
 They quit vetting politicians a long time ago, sweetheart. 
 Let's go figure out the how. 
 Gentlemen. 
 Beth Dutton. 
 Pleasure. 
 Sir. 
 Welcome. 
 Howdy. 
 You're becoming a lone ranger around here. 
 All you need is a Tonto. 
 But I guess you live here long enough to know  there's no such thing as one of those. 
 They didn't rape her. 
 If they had,  we'd be hanging their families from the rafters. 
 Yeah, this is deep enough. 
 If we're gonna burn them, why'd we dig a hole? 
 The hole is to hide the bodies. 
 That's for you. 
 You burn a body, you trap its soul. 
 Can't cross over. 
 Stuck here forever. 
 That's for me. 
 You killed them, you get the honor. 
 - I don't want it. 
 - Hey,  want's got nothing to do with it. 
 You killed the bodies,  now you kill the souls. 
 I was thinking about  cancer. 
 What it is, essentially. 
 It's the body cell so deformed, they turn on the body itself. 
 Start feeding. 
 Cancer doesn't have much foresight,  so it kills its hosts, which kills it. 
 Cancer is suicide from the inside out. 
 That's what you are, Beth. 
 Wow, that's really deep, Jamie. 
 You must be watching TED Talks on YouTube. 
 Come with me. 
 We're gonna finish this tonight. 
 This feels like something I'll be discussing with a therapist. 
 In the barn with my brother. 
 This feels like a Greek tragedy. 
 If you bring out a goat, I'm f*cking leaving. 
 Oh, my God, you are such a f*cking child. 
 Well, I'm the child running for an office no one thinks you can win. 
 All I do, every day, is fight for this family. 
 - What have you ever done? 
 - Oh, you're a fighter, Jamie. 
 - You just don't win 'em. 
 - The hell I don't! 
 If you were winning, I wouldn't be here. 
 He only calls me when you lose. 
 What did I ever lose? 
 This is the largest ranch in Montana. 
 It's 200,000 acres larger than it was when I became chief counsel. 
 Argue with him, Jamie. 
 'Cause I just don't care. 
 I don't give a sh1t about this place. 
 If Dad died tomorrow, I would sell my share to the Four Seasons  and I would swim laps in the pool they built  without an ounce of remorse. 
 Everything I do is for him and everything you do is for you. 
 The only reason I'm here is 'cause he can't trust you. 
 You are so toxic. 
 I can barely remember what you were like before you killed her. 
 - How's that taste, you pussy? 
 - God damn it. 
 - Huh? 
 - All right, stop. 
 All right, drive your polluted soul back to the city where it belongs. 
 Come on, big man. 
 Huh? 
 Just like old times. 
 I wanna see you be a man, Jamie. 
 - Stop it. 
 - Huh? 
 - Be a man. 
 - Stop. 
 - Be a man! 
 - Stop. 
 - Be a f*cking man! 
 - Stop. 
 Oh! 
 How's that for a man? 
 A man would have walked away. 
 Jesus. 
 You gotta quit grabbing tigers by the tail. 
 She's gonna tear this family apart. 
 I don't need your permission to run for office. 
 You're right, you don't. 
 I'm running for attorney general. 
 We can't take the risk of someone holding that office  that we don't control. 
 It's the best thing for the ranch. 
 And I expect your support. 
 I need it. 
 And you have it. 
 Hit your sister again,  I'll put your head through the f*cking wall. 
 Good night, son. 
 He moved a f*cking river, Allen. 
 - That has got to be a violation... 
 - He moved a tributary on his land. 
 Now I don't have any recourse. 
 And even if I did,  there's not a jury in this county that will convict John Dutton of anything. 
 There's always recourse. 
 Now who's that? 
 Oh, God, that's his daughter. 
 Really? 
 Don't even think about it, Dan. 
 She's an assassin. 
 And what am I, Allen? 
 What am I? 
 What? 
 Something tells me that you deserved that. 
 Earned it. 
 Be more accurate. 
 Dan. 
 I know who you are. 
 So how you gonna get back at my father? 
 Hmm? 
 You gonna try and f*ck his daughter  after he f*cked you out of a $100 million subdivision? 
 - Seem like a fair trade to you? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Hmm. 
 - Yeah, it does right now. 
 Yeah. 
 Aren't you married, Dan? 
 Three kids. 
 You don't strike me as the kind of woman that bothers. 
 I'd prefer it. 
 Where's the fun in wrecking a single man? 
 When I break you,  I want to know that I'm breaking generations. 
 Oh, there better be beams of light between your legs. 
 It's like touching the sunrise. 
 Oh. 
 Sorry, Mr. 
 Dutton, should I, um... 
 You never knew your grandmother, did you? 
 No, she, uh... 
 She died when my mother was young. 
 I remember. 
 Where's your mother now? 
 All my family's dead or in prison. 
 Just me and my grandfather left. 
 He used to say,  when his wife died, it... 
 It killed the whole family. 
 That sort of says something, sir. 
 That you kept yours together. 
 Oh, it killed mine, too. 
 Just taking it longer to die. 
 Good night, Jim. 
 Got all these cattle from the reservation. 
 - Where do you want them? 
 - Keep heading up this route. 
 We'll kick them out in the pasture. 
 There's a bunch. 
 Gonna scatter from here to hell and gone. 
 Yeah, well, that's what cowboys are for. 
 - Who's this one belong to? 
 - Forest service. 
 - How they pay? 
 - Like sh1t. 
 - Nice horse? 
 - Eh, not really. 
 You know, sometimes I think there's not a good horse left on earth. 
 All the good ones, long gone. 
 Don't go in the house! 
 Ah... 
 Nature, nurture, heaven, and home  Sum of all, and by them, driven  To conquer every mountain shown  But I've never crossed the river  Braved the forests, braved the stone  Braved the icy winds and fire  Braved and beat them on my own  Yet I'm helpless by the river  Angel, angel, what have I done? 
 I've faced the quakes, the wind, the fire  I've conquered country, crown, and throne  Why can't I cross this river?
