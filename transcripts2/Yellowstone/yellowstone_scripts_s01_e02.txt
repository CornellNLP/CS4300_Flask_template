 - (HORSE NEIGHING) 
 - JOHN: Easy. 
 (SHUSHES) 
 Easy. 
 Easy now. 
 That's right. 
 Just like that. 
 Take this real slow. 
 (HORSE NEIGHS IN ANGER) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 God... 
 That is some gift. 
 JOHN: God damn that boy. 
 Easy, easy. 
 There you go. 
 (HORSE NEIGHING) 
 (FENCE THUMPS AND RATTLES) 
 (HORSE NEIGHS) 
 I think I got him settled now. 
 (HORSE NEIGHS) 
 Whoa, he's going over. 
 (HORSE SQUEALS) 
 JOHN: God. 
 RIP: That's one rank son of a bitch right there. 
 You ought to take him chest high in the river  and see how much buck he's got then. 
 No, no, this one, uh... 
 This one may surprise you. 
 Look at this, now he's my... 
 Now he's my best God damned friend. 
 Well, you want me to give him a go? 
 No, hell no. 
 This is a job for a young man with rubber bones. 
 RIP: That horse will make a hand out of someone. 
 That's a good idea. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Hey, Jimmy, go ahead and put that down. 
 (DUCT TAPE SCREECHING) 
 JIMMY: Look, I don't know nothing about horses. 
 Well, you're getting a crash course, Jimmy. 
 - (HORSE SNORTS) 
 - Should I pet him? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I don't think it's gonna make much difference. 
 - You got it on your side? 
 - RIP: Yeah, I'm good. 
 You pull this, so you don't flip back, you understand? 
 All right? 
 He's gonna hate it for sh1t, but whatever you do, Jimmy,  don't you let go. 
 Look, can we just... 
 Can we talk about this for a second? 
 - Good luck, Jimmy. 
 - MAN 1: $20 on the horse. 
 MAN 2: I got $40 on the wall. 
 I'd expect some resistance. 
 - Define resistance. 
 - JOHN: You be quiet. 
 Resistance the kind of thing that defines itself, Jimmy. 
 Let's go. 
 RIP: Kick him. 
 (HORSE NEIGHS) 
 MAN 1: Pull in those reins, Jimmy. 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa! 
 (HORSE NEIGHING) 
 Whoo! 
 Whoa! 
 - MAN 1: Pull your reins in, Jimmy! 
 - Whoo-hoo! 
 God damn, that thing's a freight train. 
 (HORSE SNORTING) 
 Whoo-whee, I don't miss being low man. 
 Low man's what turns you into cowboys. 
 It'll make him one too. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (ENGINE REVVING) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 f*ck, God damn it. 
 Piece of sh1t. 
 Son of a... 
 (GRUNTS) 
 What happened to the tractor? 
 I flipped it. 
 Why'd you do that? 
 What's that for? 
 Get in the house. 
 (METAL CLANKS) 
 I think the tractor's already dead. 
 - Get in the God damned house. 
 - (SIGHS) 
 Porch ain't inside. 
 I don't care! 
 Suit yourself. 
 Hey, I want you to do exactly as I say, okay? 
 Cover your ears. 
 Open your mouth real wide, like you're at the dentist. 
 Stay just like that, you hear me? 
 (SCREAMS) 
 You can close your mouth now. 
 Why didn't you do that in the first place? 
 Was that you? 
 Are you out of your f*cking mind? 
 That's why. 
 Sorry, babe, there was a thing with the tractor. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Mama owes me a dollar. 
 Yeah, have fun trying to collect that. 
 You're gonna be in a big time out. 
 I'm already in a time out, son. 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) 
 You found a dinosaur. 
 Oh. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 WOMAN: Mr. Dutton. 
 Mr. Dutton. 
 Mr. Dutton. 
 The Governor wants to see you. 
 Sure thing. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGING) 
 RECEPTIONIST: Governor Perry's office. 
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 JAMIE: Morning. 
 There's things we'd like to talk to you about. 
 Things like your future. 
 - I'd like that. 
 - GOVERNOR PERRY: So would we. 
 But first, there's something else we have to talk about. 
 Have a seat. 
 What's this? 
 Nothing, because you never saw it. 
 Okay. 
 The bullet wound inflicted on your brother severed his spinal column at C7,  which would leave him paralyzed from the chest down,  including his arms from his elbow to his fingers. 
 Would've been impossible for him to fire a pistol,  which means there was a third shooter. 
 Well, what does that matter? 
 Um... 
 Self-defense is self-defense, even if someone else pulled the trigger. 
 - Isn't that simple, Jamie. 
 - No matter who pulled the trigger,  it wasn't self-defense. 
 It was an execution. 
 The medical examiner hasn't released his findings yet. 
 But when he does, it'll go to BIA, FBI, state police,  each of whom will want their own forensic pathologist  to have a look at the body. 
 Then this starts screaming "cover-up." And it's screaming it at your father. 
 The real concern is who it screams at next. 
 Two BLM agents stated seeing another rider on the horse  with Lee when he arrived at the Yellowstone. 
 What did they, um... 
 Did they identify him? 
 They're friends. 
 Friends forget things. 
 But some of this starts adding up real quick, Jamie. 
 This is already national news. 
 Add a racially-motivated killing by an officer of your father's agency... 
 I'll have to start chopping heads, or it's mine on the block. 
 What are you saying? 
 He's saying, "Don't put us in that position."  Okay, um, I just... 
 I could use some time here. 
 How long can you hold this report? 
 A week, maybe. 
 I'll get into it. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Do it fast. 
 This is the kind of ship that sinks everyone. 
 That's the only kind of ship I ever find myself on. 
 (FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 - Yeah. 
 - Are you sick? 
 - Do I look sick? 
 You're in bed at noon, a dozen pill bottles beside you. 
 Yeah, I'd say you look sick. 
 - I'm on vacation. 
 - Oh, is that what you're calling it now? 
 What do you want? 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 This feels very serious. 
 (SIGHS) 
 - I could use some advice. 
 - Yes, I know you're gay. 
 No, Daddy will not still love you when you tell him. 
 I'm wasting my f*cking time asking you for help. 
 (BETH EXHALES) 
 You know, if being here is so terrible for you, Beth,  - you can go back to Salt Lake. 
 - You asked for advice. 
 I gave it. 
 Well, you know, I'm not gay. 
 I'm celibate. 
 Because I am terrified to get somebody pregnant,  pass on the gene that made you. 
 Good one. 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 Well, you're almost a winner. 
 Day ain't over yet. 
 JAMIE: We have a problem. 
 You don't have a solution? 
 It requires a few. 
 And you're not gonna like any of them. 
 Did they identify Kayce? 
 Not yet. 
 Who are the agents we're talking about? 
 It's, uh, Tom Reynolds and Aaron McReary. 
 Reynolds I can deal with. 
 I don't know this McReary. 
 Yeah, he lives in the south end of the valley. 
 Word is he likes his religion. 
 As in "won't tell a lie" likes it? 
 Yeah, that would be my guess. 
 Find out where he goes to church. 
 Anything else? 
 Anything else? 
 You said there were a few. 
 (SIGHS) 
 The medical examiner's report. 
 You're not gonna like it. 
 Who else has seen the report? 
 The only ones who have seen it want it to change. 
 - Then it'll change. 
 - It means they're doctors. 
 Which means they took an oath, and it wasn't to you. 
 No matter what we do, the photographs won't change. 
 The body won't change. 
 It'll tell the same story  - to anybody who looks. 
 - The body's buried, Jamie. 
 Relax. 
 Yeah, but when they see the report... 
 When they see the report, what? 
 When they see... 
 You think I'm just gonna let them dig up my son? 
 When they see the report, they won't ask. 
 They're just gonna do it, Dad. 
 - I think we should... 
 - No, don't say it. 
 I think we should beat them to it. 
 All right, don't say it. 
 Don't even think it. 
 Kayce shot him in the forehead while he laid on his back. 
 - We don't know it was Kayce. 
 - He was executed. 
 Five bullets in a circle, like this. 
 Name the livestock officer who could do that. 
 I need to hear him say it first. 
 You know, there was a time  when most of Montana was under the ocean. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, and I'm betting that... 
 I'm betting that right here... 
 I'm betting that right here was the beach. 
 'Cause you see this? 
 I'm thinking these washed up on the shore, and your buddy here, the dinosaur,  he's probably out walking, looking for dinner right here. 
 - Then what happened? 
 - I don't know. 
 Hard to say. 
 Maybe something... 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Something made a dinner out of him. 
 - Like what? 
 - Mmm. 
 Maybe a sea shark. 
 How big are those? 
 From here to the round corral. 
 - That's a big fish. 
 - That's a big fish. 
 I don't wanna catch that fish. 
 No, me neither. 
 Don't ever wanna see a fish like that. 
 Do you think some day an explorer will find our bones  and wonder what happened to us? 
 I think after us, Tate,  the exploring's all done. 
 You, uh, keep it up. 
 I'm gonna... 
 I'm gonna talk to your daddy a bit. 
 Jesus Christ, what... 
 What happened here? 
 - Long story. 
 - I need to ask you something. 
 I already told you. 
 - I need the truth this time. 
 - I told you the truth. 
 Yes, you're such a boy. 
 This ain't checkers, son. 
 This is chess, and you're about to play it with masters. 
 Now, these people, they're gonna twist you into so many knots,  you won't know where the truth begins and your future ends. 
 Now, brothers get their secrets, all right? 
 But he was my son. 
 I deserve to know. 
 What happened that night stays where it is. 
 No, sir. 
 No, sir, not a thing on this planet stays where it is. 
 Not one. 
 At least tell me this. 
 Did... 
 Did he get to see it coming? 
 He saw it coming. 
 (SIGHS) 
 What'd he say? 
 We need that medical examiner to take a new oath. 
 (SIGHS) 
 What? 
 Um, asking the medical examiner to sit on the report  didn't go over so well. 
 He shared Long's autopsy with the tribal police. 
 God. 
 God damn it. 
 (SIGHS) 
 All right. 
 What do we know about this son of a bitch? 
 He used to be the medical examiner in Chicago. 
 He was asked to resign. 
 Got caught smoking embalming fluid. 
 Smoking what? 
 Smoking embalming fluid. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Now, if he was fired, and the cause came out,  every finding he's ever issued will be ruled inadmissible. 
 I think I can push this. 
 You want me to? 
 Let me think about it. 
 No... 
 Send Rip. 
 I won't negotiate with a drug addict. 
 Well, it's an even bet who quits first. 
 Yeah? 
 That boy quit hours ago. 
 If he wasn't strapped to the saddle, he'd be laying in the dirt. 
 Yeah, he'll be a cowboy before sundown. 
 It's just a favor, Rip. 
 And I'm afraid that's all he'll ever be. 
 THOMAS: It's a pretty good shot. 
 Yeah, that is a pretty good shot. 
 Hard to call that self-defense. 
 If Lee Dutton was alive, I'd press charges. 
 Are we sure Lee Dutton is the one who did it? 
 BEN: As we can be. 
 I mean, I'm not sure what difference it makes at this point. 
 I'll tell you what difference it makes. 
 Right now, we have a tragedy. 
 If there is a third shooter,  we have something entirely different. 
 We have the end of John Dutton right here. 
 And there's no witnesses, right? 
 The only person near the scene was Kayce. 
 He may be on our side with cattle, but this is different. 
 - Kayce Dutton. 
 - Yeah, the hero. 
 The soldier. 
 (MENACING MUSIC PLAYING) 
 RIP: Whoa, easy. 
 JOHN: Pull him down. 
 RIP: Easy. 
 Easy. 
 There you go. 
 Come on. 
 (JIMMY GRUNTS) 
 (SNIFFLES AND SPITS) 
 Over there. 
 (SMACKS LIPS) 
 Come on, come on. 
 Whoa, whoa, be easy. 
 Easy. 
 Easy. 
 Jimmy. 
 You go bathe him, tie him up, and no hay until he cools off. 
 Go on. 
 Well, the son of a bitch is broke now. 
 Oh. 
 (RETCHES) 
 - Here we go. 
 - Yeah. 
 There may be a little cowboy in him after all. 
 I don't have the energy for you today. 
 Never thought of energy as something you lacked. 
 Take me anywhere but a music festival. 
 Beth, I thought you liked music. 
 That's why I suggested it. 
 Still like music. 
 The festival part that bothers me. 
 Pick something more suited to my personality. 
 You wanna go get drunk,  and watch some wolves kill an elk in a park? 
 I'll drive. 
 ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for coming out... 
 (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
 We got some top cowboys in the bull riding event. 
 And our first cowboy out will be Toby Reynolds. 
 Come on now, Toby, let's go. 
 All right, Toby's got a cheering section. 
 Here we go! 
 Toby Reynolds. 
 Shaves a year off my life every time I see him ride. 
 Shaved a year off mine. 
 He's your kid. 
 How you kept your boys out of rodeo, I'll never know. 
 I taught 'em young, Carl. 
 Only reason to ride a bull, meet a nurse. 
 Wouldn't be surprised if nurses were behind  the whole God damned thing. 
 Lord knows it ain't the pay. 
 Yeah. 
 You know exactly what it is. 
 Shoot, I told him a thousand times I'd just give him the damn buckle. 
 Well, that's the difference between raising a son and a daughter. 
 All you do with a daughter is just try to keep her from getting screwed. 
 All you do with a son is try to keep him from screwing himself. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 And that's a lot harder to do. 
 Well, that's why I'm here, Carl. 
 I need your help to unscrew something. 
 Your oldest boy said he saw someone bring Lee to my house. 
 Yeah, that's what he told me. 
 Yeah, well, he's gotta stop telling people that. 
 - That's not what happened? 
 - That's exactly what happened. 
 It's gonna cost me another son if he keeps telling it. 
 (BLUR'S SONG 2 PLAYING) 
 Well, you tell me what he should've seen, John,  and by tomorrow that'll be all he ever saw. 
 You got my word. 
 MAN: (SINGING) 
 Whee-hoo  Thank you. 
 ANNOUNCER: Derek de la Casa. 
 Here we go. 
 (SINGING) 
 Whee-hoo  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
 (ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) 
 I hope I never meet the first man who thought  it was a good idea to ride a bull. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I don't know, Carl. 
 First man might be worth meeting. 
 It's the second man I wonder about. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 ANNOUNCER: Let's give another big, big round of applause  for our hopeful Dan Tana. 
 Give it up again. 
 Thank you. 
 - RIP: Hmm. 
 - (WOLF HOWLS) 
 That's a big fucker right there. 
 Look at that. 
 That's a big f*cking wolf. 
 I've done some morbid sh1t on a first date,  but this takes the cake, Rip. 
 It's far from a first date, Beth. 
 Statute of limitations on our first date ran out years ago. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 When something dies in the city, it's... 
 It's roped off, zipped into a bag and carried away  before anyone can bother to notice. 
 Mmm. 
 Well, pretending it don't happen don't make it not happen. 
 That's very astute, Rip. 
 I should embroider that on a pillow. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 It makes you think it doesn't. 
 It's almost the same thing. 
 Yeah, well,  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but everything you know,  and everyone you see everywhere is gonna die. 
 You got old. 
 Mmm, yeah. 
 God, you haven't aged a day. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 sh1t, you might just cheat death yet. 
 Beth. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Beth! 
 - (BETH CONTINUES SCREAMING) 
 - RIP: Get! 
 (SCREAMS) 
 RIP: Get, get. 
 (PANTING) 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 You should try Zumba. 
 Get that cardio up. 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
 Cheatin' death, like you said. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 You're the craziest person I've ever met in my life, you know that? 
 It's only the things I love that die, Rip, never me. 
 Yeah? 
 Come to think of it, I'm surprised you're still standing. 
 Guess God ain't done punishing you either. 
 (WOLF HOWLS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (BAD NEWS PLAYING) 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 MAN: (SINGING OVER SPEAKERS) 
 Bad news travels like wildfire  Good news travels slow  Next up. 
 They all call me Wildfire  That's you, sh1t stain. 
 I'm gonna wait for the water to warm. 
 You keep saying that and keep not doing it. 
 I'm the one who's gotta sleep next to you. 
 Take a f*cking shower. 
 Cold shower's in your future, Jimmy. 
 Till they hire someone new. 
 So you might as well get used to it. 
 sh1t. 
 We did. 
 It's better than being dirty. 
 - Gonna give it an hour. 
 - You'll be asleep in an hour. 
 You smell like a God damned goat. 
 Get up. 
 Get up. 
 Everywhere I go  Hey, man. 
 Looks like you're taking that shower now, Jimmy. 
 I'm going. 
 Get the f*ck off me. 
 - Then f*cking go. 
 - Get off, get the... 
 (EXHALES DEEPLY) 
 You can take my shower in the morning, Jimmy. 
 It's plenty hot then. 
 Besides... 
 A little cold water don't bother me none. 
 f*ck you. 
 The story's all the same  - (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 - (DOOR OPENS) 
 Where you been, sweetheart? 
 The park. 
 What are you doing? 
 Trying to make a... 
 Another decision a father shouldn't have to make. 
 What're your thoughts on judgment day? 
 It's every day in my experience. 
 And the Bible says a cremated body can't rise. 
 Well, fortunately, that's not a decision you have to make today. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Something Lee did? 
 Something he didn't do. 
 Okay, who did? 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Then the decision's easy. 
 Kayce was her favorite. 
 And we promised to protect him. 
 Well, I've done a piss-poor job of that. 
 You haven't broken it yet. 
 (KISSES) 
 I remember when you were a boy,  up on scaffolding,  hanging beams, right up there. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I think that was the last time you were in here. 
 Yeah. 
 I've seen too much bad in my life to believe God exists. 
 Guess you're here just in case. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Don't question the house you've built, John. 
 It's not uncommon  to doubt one's faith in the face of tragedy. 
 It's when you need it most. 
 Faith is where you find comfort. 
 Well, I'm well past seeking comfort. 
 Uh, I'm here for something else. 
 Any sins you've committed are forgiven, John, you know that. 
 All you have to do is believe it. 
 Tell you the truth... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I don't regret one sin I've committed. 
 (SIGHS) 
 It's the one I'm about to commit that worries me. 
 And it should worry you too, Father, because you're gonna help me commit it. 
 I'm collecting old debts, Bob. 
 And you owe me a big one. 
 FATHER BOB: False witness. 
 It seems odd that God would find it necessary  to make two Commandments that instruct us not to lie. 
 But the Ninth Commandment has nothing to do with lying. 
 It is about your neighbor,  the men and women sitting here with you today. 
 
 
 
 It's about your flock. 
 It is about your shepherds. 
 And one of our shepherds is suffering. 
 The pain of his loss reverberates throughout this congregation. 
 And his suffering is not over. 
 Because Satan has found an open window  and he is climbing through. 
 The Ninth Commandment forbids  speaking against your neighbor in any manner. 
 It forbids you from destroying his reputation  or threatening his position or the sanctity of his family. 
 Because his family is your family. 
 His flock is your flock. 
 But Satan does not attack the flock. 
 He attacks the shepherd. 
 He attacks him by tricking your mind. 
 By making you see what he wants you to see. 
 And when he has destroyed the shepherd,  we are a flock no more. 
 We are merely lambs awaiting the slaughter. 
 Hello, Aaron. 
 Sometimes it, uh,  feels like your sermons are meant just for me. 
 Sometimes they are. 
 I don't choose the sermon or who it speaks to. 
 My job is just to deliver it. 
 I'm, uh... 
 - I'm having a... 
 - Let's... 
 Let's go inside. 
 Hey, Cap, how's the team? 
 MAN: (OVER PHONE) 
 A little light right now. 
 We leave for Riyadh in a week. 
 Don't believe the hype on CNN, brother. 
 Syria ain't sh1t. 
 Yemen is the domino. 
 Sure wish we had you here. 
 This sh1t's gonna get salty. 
 That's why I'm calling. 
 I was thinking about jumping back in. 
 Don't f*cking tease me, Kayce. 
 I wouldn't do it to you, sir. 
 You can get me back on the team? 
 You're not a year from discharge, are you? 
 Uh, just under. 
 Then hell yes, I can. 
 Pack your sh1t, sailor. 
 I never unpacked it. 
 Stay by your phone. 
 Keep your powder dry and get ready to fly. 
 Roger that. 
 We're gonna be late. 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) 
 What did I do? 
 You didn't do anything. 
 Okay, what did you do? 
 It's what I can't do. 
 I can't provide for a family selling horses. 
 Maybe you could if you'd actually sell 'em and not give 'em away. 
 I got two skills, and only one of 'em pays. 
 I'm not gonna have my wife providing for my family... 
 Don't you dare invent a way to make this my fault. 
 You had no problem being a broke horse trainer a week ago,  and neither did I. 
 What, you let your father back in  and all of a sudden going to war is the best option? 
 I'm no good at this, Monica. 
 Ain't that the truth. 
 You might be the worst liar I've ever met. 
 So just stop lying and tell me why you're leaving us. 
 KAYCE: I just... 
 MONICA: The truth, Kayce. 
 We've always told it. 
 Don't stop now. 
 - I was the one... 
 - (EXPLOSION) 
 (TIRES SCREECH) 
 - You all right? 
 - Yeah. 
 - What was that? 
 - Meth lab's my guess. 
 Call 911. 
 Stay here. 
 (DOG WHIMPERS) 
 (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) 
 MAN: (WEAKLY) 
 Family. 
 Family. 
 Family. 
 Family. 
 You ain't got one no more. 
 Kill me. 
 Kill me. 
 Kill me. 
 Hey, I've got 911. 
 Are there people back there? 
 Not anymore. 
 What are you doing? 
 - Stay here. 
 - No. 
 You don't wanna see this. 
 Kayce, I go where you go. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Cover your mouth. 
 Don't breathe in the fumes. 
 Please kill me. 
 How long on the ambulance? 
 How long on the ambulance? 
 They... 
 They said 45 minutes. 
 - Kill me. 
 - He ain't got 45 minutes. 
 There's no pain like burning. 
 Do it. 
 (CHATTER ON RADIO) 
 Oh, it was the right thing to do. 
 No question. 
 What do you wanna do? 
 I'm not ready to play this hand. 
 Not like this. 
 Just make it go away. 
 You got off easy. 
 I would've let you burn. 
 I hear you SEALs like the G-19. 
 Is that what you used? 
 Give me your slide. 
 I like 'em too. 
 (GUN CLICKS) 
 You were there. 
 I put that piece of sh1t out of his misery. 
 Understand? 
 You're my witness. 
 I'll put it that way in my report. 
 Okay. 
 THOMAS: Follow my vehicle with your truck. 
 Uh, we gotta pick our kid up from school. 
 We are covered in evil. 
 You and me. 
 We gotta wash it off. 
 (FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING) 
 You know what I think? 
 I think a man who does that to himself never changes sides. 
 I know I won't. 
 I didn't do this to myself. 
 We don't get to choose our fathers. 
 Wouldn't make any difference if we could. 
 We'd just choose wrong. 
 Son doesn't look like you. 
 No. 
 He got lucky. 
 Looked like you when he was born, though, didn't he? 
 Just like you. 
 Like a mirror. 
 Every child looks like their father when they're born. 
 Doesn't matter, boy or girl. 
 Doesn't matter who they look like three days later. 
 When they come out of the womb,  they are a perfect reflection of the man who made them. 
 He was. 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 You wanna know why? 
 It's nature's way of proving that you are the father. 
 So that you don't think the baby belongs to someone else,  and kill it. 
 There's no such thing as a good man, Kayce. 
 All men are bad. 
 But some of us try real hard to be good. 
 Stones are ready. 
 Your first sweat? 
 The ceremony doesn't end when the sweat ends. 
 Study the things you see. 
 They're a map of your future. 
 The good thing about maps  is if you don't like the path that you're on,  you can always choose another. 
 When does the ceremony end? 
 When you die, and the next one begins.

 This oven will incinerate a horse in an hour. 
 Never had a person in it, though. 
 My guess is you'll have ashes in about ten minutes. 
 (INCINERATOR WHOOSHES) 
 - RIP: Why do you do that? 
 - (TOOL CLINKS ON FLOOR) 
 Make you feel better? 
 Makes it so I don't feel anything. 
 Mmm. 
 Well, what're you trying to forget? 
 Everything. 
 If you were willing to forget everything, I wouldn't be here. 
 You wanna go, m*therf*cker? 
 Huh? 
 You wanna f*cking go? 
 You wanna? 
 (DRILL WHIRS) 
 - Huh? 
 - Come on. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 MONICA: Hey, sweetie. 
 You want a bug book or a snake book? 
 Dinosaur book. 
 You want me to read it to you? 
 No. 
 My dad needs to because we found one. 
 And it's our secret. 
 You can't know about it, 'cause if you tell someone,  they might steal it. 
 Well, Daddy's not here, honey,  so you're either gonna have to tell me the secret  or settle for looking at pictures. 
 - Pictures. 
 - Suit yourself, kid. 
 - RIP: What's the green one do? 
 - It's oxygen. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Go on, pull that one too. 
 - (OXYGEN HISSES OUT) 
 - Now, come here. 
 Come here. 
 I want you to take these tools here and put 'em in the tray. 
 - I don't want to. 
 - That ain't what I asked you. 
 Come on, man, can we talk about this? 
 - You had your chance. 
 - I... 
 I will never say a word. 
 I swear to God. 
 - Please. 
 - Why are you so scared? 
 I don't wanna die. 
 - No? 
 - I don't want... 
 Don't seem like you wanna live either. 
 So which one is it? 
 Wha-ah-ah. 
 Which one is it? 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 You see, it's the habit of living that you're scared of losing. 
 That's all. 
 Now, pick the f*cking tools up  and put 'em in the tray like I asked you. 
 Yeah. 
 (SIGHS) 
 That's enough now. 
 Now we're gonna put it in the microwave. 
 Now, don't move. 
 Is this the only computer that's got this report? 
 Yeah. 
 Not the one at your house? 
 No. 
 Wha... 
 Who do you think this is gonna fool, man? 
 Everyone's gonna know this is arson. 
 No, no, it doesn't look like arson to me. 
 Looks like suicide. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Deep down that's what you want, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 Can I have one? 
 Sure, go on.

 If I'm gonna lose you,  it's gonna be because of what I did, not because I lied to you. 
 If I give you this lie, will you stay? 
 Well, if I stay, you'll learn it. 
 Well, I guess that's what we meant when we said for better or for worse. 
 It's gonna get worse than this. 
 TATE: Daddy. 
 Please say you'll stay. 
 Whatever I do, it's because I love you, I'll say that. 
 Baby, look at me. 
 There is nothing you could do I won't forgive you for. 
 Yeah, there is. 
 TATE: Daddy! 
 I wanna be with my son. 
 TATE: Do you think ours is as big as that one? 
 I don't know. 
 Might be bigger. 
 We need to dig him up tomorrow. 
 Well, we can start, but that's gonna be a lot of work. 
 I ain't scared of work. 
 Where should we hide him? 
 How about the barn? 
 No, people will look there. 
 (GASPS) 
 Maybe we should dig a cave. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Whatever you want, buddy. 
 (ACOUSTIC COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) 
 MAN: (SINGING) 
 Spending time today  Is the only way  To buy a new tomorrow  And I'll agree  That you and me  Have the same price to pay  For nothing sane  Was ever gained  You know, most fathers don't have to... 
 Don't have to do this twice. 
 Since I do, I thought I'd bring you some company, sweetheart. 
 Forever seldom lasts  Goodbye, yesterday  Goodbye, dreams  I won't be dreaming  Goodbye, memories  Of a love I thought was true  Goodbye, reasons why  I cried all night  And wished that I could die  Goodbye, yesterday  Yesterday  Goodbye  At the break of day  I'll find a way  To face the new tomorrow  And with the dawn  I'll carry on  And I'll have no regrets  Oh, memories  Of you and me  Will fade and pass away...
