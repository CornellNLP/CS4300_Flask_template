 Previously on Yellowstone... 
 I'm done begging you to stay. 
 In fact the opposite. 
 I'm telling you to go. 
 Sell me the land. 
 And I'll give you Yellowstone. 
 How's that feel? 
 Like you're three seconds away from being pepper sprayed. 
 Talk to me about cancer. 
 What would you like to know? 
 For a start how long have you had it? 
 This is screaming cover up. 
 And it's screaming at your father. 
 You ever get concerned that some of John Dutton's problems become Jamie's problems? 
 Think she's on to me. 
 Well we can go home. No. 
 My editor wants this story. 
 First thing you're doing tomorrow is withdrawing from the race. 
 What? I've earned this. 
 After everything I've done for you! 
 If that ain't self-defense, I don't know what is. 
 If that's where you were really standing.

 I really wish it hadn't come to this. 
 We need you to step down as livestock commissioner. 
 You violated federal law when you sent agents onto the reservation.

 We also understand there are civil suits filed against you. 
 We heard that the EPA is investigating you for rerouting a river, John.

 I can't allow a public official under this much scrutiny to threaten the other offices in this state. Mine included. 
 There's a giant spotlight on you. 
 You stepping down dims that light for all of us. 
 And once you get these things behind you... we'll welcome you back.
