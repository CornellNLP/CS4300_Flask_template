 [MUSIC]   
 [COUGHING]   
 Every road from the rodeo leads right here.   
 What day is it?   
 Well, it's payday, for the hospital.   
 They won the lottery with you...   
 Had to write all this sh1t down...   
 You have a compression fracture in your neck and two in your back.    
 A bone fragment's pressed against your spine, can't figure out how to get that out.    
 Shattered your hip, which they just up and replaced.    
 Doctor said you're the youngest person he's ever done that to.    
 So, congratulations for that.    
 He wants you up and walking today.    
 How that's possible I have... I have no idea...    
 You have a grade three concussion.    
 We're supposed to bring you back to the hospital if you experience nausea or confusion.    
 I asked if there's other symptoms since nauseous and confused is your natural state of being.    
 They said your eyes might dilate.    
 So, we'll be on the lookout for that.    
 What's wrong with my arm?    
 Well, they didn't mention your arm. So it must be fine.    
 Doesn't look fine.    
 Well, compared to the rest of this sh1t, it's fine.    
 How am I gonna...    
 How am I gonna pay for all this?    
 Well, the hospital's pretty curious about that themselves.    
 Look at me.    
 Hospital bill's not a concern.    
 But you gotta make me a promise: no more rodeo.    
 It's the only thing that ever... ever made me feel like I was worth something.    
 Yeah.    
 Well, I figured as much.    
 - Ow. 
- Learn to rope.    
 All you're risking is a thumb, and... you got two of those.    
 Mister Dutton, uh...    
 Thank you.    
 Yeah, well, learn to rope, Jimmy.    
 I'm not paying for this sh1t twice.    
 [GROANS]    
 Okay, Jimmy.    
 We're going to help you up so you can walk.    
 Don't really feel like walking, so...    
 Your hip replacement needs you to move around a bit.    
 But first we need to remove your catheter.    
 All right, just lift.    
 - There we go. 
- [GRUNTS]    
 All right, deep breath.    
 You're going to feel a little pressure when I pull, okay?    
 Hi.    
 You survived.    
 Oh!    
 All right, getting the mystery out of the way right up front, huh?    
 Is it just... is it swollen from the...    
 I think it's the way God made that one.    
 Hmm.    
 This isn't happening.    
 - Can I help? 
- Are you a relative?    
 Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm his girlfriend.    
 Yeah, sure. Just, uh, come over here. Grab an arm.    
 [MUSIC]    
 All right.    
 All right, here.    
 I don't know if I can be in a relationship with someone who shows such poor judgment.    
 Well, I'm a barrel racer.    
 So bad judgment's just part of the package.    
 Don't have a dog, do you?    
 I have two, actually.    
 [LAUGHS] That f*ckin' figures.    
 [MUSIC]    
 [KNOCKING]    
 I am not sure this is appropriate, Chairman.    
 I don't represent the Jenkins' estate.    
 Or, whatever's left of it, I mean.    
 His estate is not my concern at the moment.    
 Is there any validity to this?    
 It's a chess move.    
 It puts you on the defensive.    
 Stops you from building. But...    
 But they don't have a winnable case.    
 Well, define winnable.    
 If you mean a judgment in their favor? No.    
 But, you know, they can drag this out for years.    
 This isn't a leveraged land developer, this is a multibillion dollar corporation that can spend   , 
    million dollars in legal fees.    
 And the reality is, that, you know,    
 I doubt they even want your land.    
 They just don't want an Indian casino adjacent to a planned community.     
 So, they'll try to buy me out.     
 I doubt they'll even bother.     
 May I ask you a question? 
A personal question?     
 Why build a casino in the first place?     
 I mean what's the real reason?     
 There are better locations with far better access.     
 There's two futures for this valley: one with the land stripped of the second homes and hobby farms, and returned to the ways it used to be...     
 You drive twenty miles into the park and that's how our whole nation looked at one time.     
 Modern society wants people to go to school and learn a trade to make money to buy food, clothes, a place to live.     
 But on land that hasn't been ravaged by man, you don't need to buy food.     
 You just go find it.     
 You don't buy clothes, you make them.     
 And you don't build houses, you seek shelter.     
 You live with the land. Not on it.     
 You said two futures. What's the other?     
 The other's where you live.     
 Concrete worlds with stick houses and grass that can't survive without fertilizer and sprinklers.     
 Some day this planet's going to shake your world off its back like rainwater.     
 The casino gives me the money I need to make sure that happens.     
 The first future is the only future.     
 People prefer concrete, I'm afraid.     
 Nobody wants your future.     
 No one in your world.     
 Well...     
 I wish I could tell you how to fight them.     
 If anyone knew how to fight them, there'd be no such thing as reservations.     
 What do you think, Mo?     
 I think you need a lawyer and not him.     
 Well, men like him have their use.     
 But no, not for this...     
 We've always known how to fight them, Tom.     
 We just didn't 'cause we didn't want to be like them.     
 I think it's time you be like them.     
 The people would never forgive me.     
 - It's for the people. 
- Still won't forgive me.     
 But I'm going to do it anyway.     
 Get John Dutton on the phone for me.     
 Angela Blue Thunder, please.     
 Chairman Rainwater.     
 You're going to need to sage off after you speak with her.     
 I know.     
 That's a pretty big bear to poke, Beth.     
 And their activity in the valley has our holdings up twenty percent.     
 I'm not poking them. 
It's an opportunity, Bob.     
 If they thought their airport approvals were guaranteed, they would be screaming it from the rooftops.     
 Tell me it is not ripe to short.     
 When you put the word out, they're going to know it's you.     
 Well, I'm not gonna put the word out.     
 You are.     
 It is ripe to short. Do you disagree?     
 They're exposed, it's true.     
 And it's gonna cut them pretty deep, and they are going to come out swinging.     
 Yeah, well, that's just life in the Serengeti, I guess.     
 You want to call the fund managers or the press?     
 I'll take the managers.     
 But, Beth, just a little leak.     
 Just a leak, you know? Do not blow up the dam.     
 Oh, come on, Bob. 
You know me better than that.     
 That's why I'm saying just a leak.     
 A medium leak.     
 Anything worth doing is worth doing right.     
 Right?     
 Thank you.     
 I'll call you back.

 - Yep.

 [MUSIC CONTINUES]     
 What's that flag for?     
 Well, it teaches these colts to use their bodies the right way before I put them on a cow.     
 Why not just use a cow?     
 For hell's sakes, lady, that's kind of like practicing a fist fight when you're already in the middle of one, ya know what I mean?     
 A tough call.     
 Oh, f*ck, you're the Governor.     
 - [SCOFFS] 
- Miss, I'm sorry. f*ck, I...     
 I'm sorry. Shut up, Jake.     
 I'm looking for John.     
 He's up there at the summer camp.     
 Well, can you point the way?     
 It's that way, but you ain't gonna get them machines up there.     
 Can you, uh, can you ride a horse?     
 Hmm. Yeah, I can ride.     
 Perfect, I'll go saddle you one.     
 Ma'am, we can't have you on a horse.     
 - Safety concerns. 
- He's, uh...     
 He's saying no to the horse, so...     
 He's worried Montana won't survive if I fall off.     
 Well, hell, uh...     
 I got a better idea.     
 [MOTOR APPROACHING]     
 - Thank you. 
- Yes, ma'am.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 So, this is where you've been hiding out, huh?     
 Yeah, well, pretty good spot, huh?     
 Yeah, I can see why you fight so hard for it.     
 Yeah. No one, uh...     
 No one questions it from here.     
 To what do I owe the pleasure?     
 The pleasure, John?     
 I think you've been in the woods too long.     
 Where's Kayce?     
 [LAUGHS] Yeah.     
 Um...     
 Jake...     
 I need you to run back to the house and grab Jamie.     
 That's... That's gonna take me a little while.     
 Yeah. Make sure of it.     
 Yes, sir.     
 John says you refused his appointment to Livestock Commissioner.     
 Yeah, I'm not a politician.     
 That's not a job for a politician.     
 I mean, sure, your father used it that way, but...     
 That's because he could.     
 What the cattlemen of Montana need is someone to protect their livelihood.     
 That's the job.     
 And at that, you would excel.     
 Well, that's Jamie's job now.     
 No, I need Jamie for something else.     
 - So does your father. 
- Need him for what?     
 To help me prevent this valley from becoming a city.     
 What do you care if it becomes a city?     
 Feel like a city would be good for you.     
 That's the great conflict of my position, you know?     
 How to keep Montana growing without losing that thing that makes it Montana.     
 Well, then just say no.     
 There'll be no city.     
 If I say no, they just go and get someone that says yes, and that person has my job.     
 Don't make sense.     
 No, it doesn't make sense to you.     
 But it makes sense to Jamie.     
 He knows how to make the law say no.     
 I'm appointing him Attorney General, and I'm appointing you Livestock Commissioner, and you will set aside your fears of becoming like your father and take on this responsibility  because all of this disappears if you don't.     
 Destiny's a hard thing to run from, isn't it?     
 Just turned out to be a lot faster than I thought.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Well, that's settled then.     
 If I do this, I gotta do it my way.     
 It's your office.     
 You can do it however you want.     
 [MUSIC]     
 - Hello, dear. 
- [LAUGHS]     
 How was your day?     
 When your dad gets tired of sleeping outside, he's gonna wonder where his daughter's sleeping. 
 Yeah, well, lucky for us, sleeping outside is his favorite thing to do. 
 We gotta be careful or I'm gonna get used to sh1t, darling. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that's the plan. 
 Oh, you got plans, do you? 
 I have a plan for everything. 
 Just sitting in your web, all alone, 
 - coming up with plans. 
 - [BOTH LAUGH] 
 And a sense of humor? 
 - Well, you know. 
 - God, where did that come from? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I've been funny all my life. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 You are many things, but baby, funny is not one of them. 
 Sorry. 
 Mm. 
 Call me that again. 
 Call you what? 
 Baby. 
 Say that again. 
 You like that, do you? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Okay, baby. 
 What should I call you? 
 Wife. 
 I didn't mean that. 
 I'm gonna make you dinner for once. 
 [EXHALES] 
 Hey. 
 Where's my ride? 
 He'll be back. 
 When? 
 Well, that's... 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 that's... 
 that's hard to say. 
 Want a drink? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 This is... 
 This is almost kidnapping. 
 Oh, just relax, Lynelle. 
 Enjoy the sunset. 
 Fine, as long as you don't give me that look. 
 What look? 
 That look. 
 That "drop your dress and get in my outfitter tent" look. 
 I'm not giving you any look. 
 Yeah, because I'm not staying, so you can just stop it. 
 Stop it. 
 - I'm not doing anything. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 Goddammit, John. 
 How is it that you're always three steps ahead of everybody everywhere you go? 
 It's just a lot of sitting and thinking... 
 thinking and sitting. 
 - And you're doing it again. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 I'm not doing anything. 
 I have to leave first thing in the morning. 
 - Oh. 
 You wanna spend the night? 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 You're such a b*st*rd. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 First thing in the morning, I meant. 
 How about second? 
 When's the last time you watched a sunset, Governor? 
 I don't know. 
 I can see why this is the dream they want to sell. 
 Yep... but you can't sell this. 
 You gotta earn it. 
 You gotta live it. 
 And that's what they'll never understand. 
 But they only want to sell it. 
 And they could care less about the dream coming true. 
 That's what you've got to understand. 
 [MUSIC] 
 You still here? 
 Through thick and thin. 
 How you feel? 
 Hip hurts. 
 Ribs hurt. 
 Back hurts. 
 How's your pecker? 
 Pecker. 
 Um... 
 Seems fine. 
 Good. 
 I was thinking we should consummate this deal. 
 Wow. 
 Um... 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] 
 That sounds great, but... 
 I don't know if they told you, my back is broken. 
 Are you saying no? 
 No. 
 No. 
 No, no, no. 
 I just, um... 
 I don't want it to paralyze me. 
 Well, it might paralyze you for a minute or two. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 You're not a virgin, are you? 
 What? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 - Come on, no. 
 Come on. 
 - Are you sure? 
 'Cause you got like a scared virgin face. 
 No, I'm not a virgin. 
 Are you a virgin? 
 I'm a barrel racer. 
 Losing your virginity is like, it's like a requirement to compete. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Maybe we should, uh, just slow down on this whole deal. 
 You are! 
 I am not a virgin.

 Morning. 
 [GROAN] 
 Yeah, sure is. 
 Baby? 
 Come back to bed. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I'll be, uh... 
 What time's breakfast? 
 LYNELLE: John? 
 Um... 
 A little later this morning. 
 Understood. 
 I'll see you in... 
 - Yeah. 
 - You know. 
 No breakfast? 
 Nah, I got a... 
 heifer auction in Butte I gotta go to. 
 I f*cked it up, didn't I? 
 I f*cked the whole thing... 
 I didn't mean it. 
 Hey, listen. 
 The only reason why I don't bring up tomorrow with you, Beth, is because every f*cking time I do, you run away. 
 I look at every day with you as a gift. 
 My tomorrows are... 
 Well, they're all yours. 
 Here. 
 There is no word that I'd rather call you. 
 I mean, if that's what you want. 
 [MUSIC] 
 You know why I always run away? 
 There's only so much I can give to you, Rip. 
 No. 
 You can give me everything. 
 No. 
 I can't have children. 
 You need to know that. 
 Being with me is the end of you. 
 I was born on a dead end road, honey. 
 This world doesn't need another generation of me. 
 I wouldn't be so sure. 
 I don't want a bunch of kids running around this f*cking house. 
 I mean, I don't even like dogs. 
 - Hey. 
 - [SNIFFS] 
 You're all I need. 
 I'll call you whatever you want. 
 Beth is fine. 
 For now. 
 Beth it is, darling. 
 Beth it is. 
 You gotta go to work. 
 Okay. 
 I gotta say, I like leaving you sitting here on the porch like this. 
 Be a whole lot better though, if you were here when I got home. 
 Well, I'll see what I can do about that. 
 [MUSIC] 
 And stocks continue their downward trend as two more oil companies were added to the U.S. 
 Trade blacklist. 
 Both companies are currently being investigated     for securities fraud. 
 And in the largest dip of the day, investment firm Market Equities falls over  . %. 
 - What the f*ck? 
 - ... causing industry-wide panic as analysts... 
 _     [MUSIC] 
 _     That f*cking bitch. 
 _     There is no protection from me, Tom. 
 You know that. 
 It's barely been a year and already you're burning sage praying for a change, instead of being it. 
 I'm trying to make it a better place. 
 All you've managed to do thus far is take all of our casino profits and buy land a Fortune Company is about to steal from you. 
 And there's nothing you can do about it. 
 You're what I'm doing about it. 
 You know what they say about making deals with the devil. 
 No, I don't, Angela. 
 What do they say? 
 That's the big mystery, Tom. 
 Is that a "yes"? 
 You'll help? 
 If that's what you want to call it. 
 She's not evil, Mo. 
 She's just angry and trying to punish the world for everything it did to her. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 That's what evil means. 
 - It's cold! 
 - Tate! 
 You haven't bathed in a week. 
 You smell like a goat. 
 - Just stay... 
 - Ha! 
 - Come back here. 
 - Catch me. 
 [BIRD SONG] 
 Well, he's got your aversion to bathing. 
 I don't mind bathing. 
 I just don't like doing it alone. 
 That's not the same thing. 
 The result's the same, though, ain't it? 
 The result just ran off into the woods. 
 How long are we staying here? 
 I don't know, baby. 
 
 
 
 I'm having a hard time thinking past "right now." This isn't real. 
 We can't live like this forever. 
 There's no such thing as forever, baby. 
 All we can do is live like there's no tomorrow 'cause one day we'll be right. 
 [MUSIC] 
 What is it? 
 Wolf. 
 - What, the same one? 
 - Yeah. 
 I think he likes watching us. 
 He's not watching, he's studying us. 
 Studying what? 
 Wants to know what we'll do when he goes after our calves. 
 I warned you. 
 Hey, where are you going? 
 Just go back to camp, baby. 
 It's okay. 
 What are you going to do? 
 - I'm gonna kill him. 
 - Don't you dare. 
 Baby, he'll feed on every... 
 Don't stop loving me to kill something. 
 Just come here. 
 Just... 
 Just love me. 
 You can kill him tomorrow.

 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Hey, hey.

 How's she working out? 
 Well, you gotta define "working out." There you go, there you go. 
 - Come on. 
 Come on.

 Come on, mothers. 
 Hey. 
 Hey-o. 
 Boys leaving her alone? 
 Leaving her alone?

 That little hyena, she looks at a man like he's a rented mule. 
 She got the bunkhouse so scared they're goin' to bed with the chickens.

 'Cause you ought be up here on mama's lap, but that's all right. 
 That's okay. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Y'all think I'm joking. 
 No, unfortunately, we don't. 
 What in the... 
 [MUSIC PLAYING] 
 They cut the f*cking fence. 
 It's too early to get in a fight. 
 [CHATTER] 
 That's gonna be nice. 
 Trust me on that. 
 That's gonna be good. 
 Hey. 
 How you doing? 
 What do these rednecks want? 
 Listen, you can't be here. 
 This is private property. 
 This is a national park. 
 That's national park. 
 This is the Dutton Ranch. 
 Sign says "Yellowstone." Got a big f*cking Y on it. 
 The Y is for the Yellowstone Ranch. 
 You said Dutton Ranch. 
 It's the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch. 
 Listen, I need you to move across the road or I'm gonna have to cite you for trespassing. 
 That badge says "livestock agent." That's right. 
 Ooh. 
 It's the f*cking cow police. 
 [LAUGHING] 
 Look at this pink-haired hick mad-dogging me. 
 - You got a problem, bitch? 
 - f*ck you just say to me? 
 - Called you a f*cking bitch. 
 - Teeter! 
 - Ah, f*ck! 
 - [GRUNTS] 
 You gotta be f*cking kidding me. 
 f*ck! 
 m*therf*cker! 
 You're a f*cking dead man. 
 You're f*cking... 
 I'll f*cking shoot you! 
 It'll be the last f*cking thing you ever do. 
 Better get after it, then. 
 Too late. 
 Which one of these assholes is the boss of you? 
 Which one of these M*therf*ckers? 
 The big guy with the beard. 
 Him? 
 - Him? 
 - Yeah. 
 Get up. 
 Get up! 
 Get up. 
 I'm gonna give you one last chance. 
 You leave now or you never leave. 
 I'll bury you where you f*cking stand. 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 - You heard him. 
 - Let's go. 
 Get out of here. 
 Let's go. 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 Why don't you cover my back? 
 - Got you. 
 - Colby, you all right? 
 I think I broke my hand. 
 That's a far cry from your heart. 
 Ron? 
 All we did was ask them to leave. 
 All right, come on. 
 What about you, Teeter? 
 You okay? 
 That is fun. 
 Bunch of assholes taking the scenic route to Sturgis. 
 Yep. 
 You know, when they come back for them bikes, they gonna f*ck this field up something fierce. 
 Probably so. 
 Let's go fix the fence. 
 Come on. 
 All right. 
 Yeah, get that. 
 Come on. 
 You guys, load up what you can. 
 All right. 
 Grab those, too. 
 Come on. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Let me guess: this is your field. 
 You gonna burn it? 
 That's your plan? 
 Might burn you with it. 
 Why? 
 Why would you do that? 
 We weren't bothering anyone. 
 We were just having some fun. 
 This field is mine. 
 That fence is mine. 
 You damaged both. 
 Then you came back to damage it more. 
 This is my home. 
 If I did this to your home, what would you do? 
 I'd kill you. 
 That's right. 
 [RUSTLING] 
 My man said you if you didn't leave, we'd bury you here. 
 And you didn't leave. 
 We keep our word in this valley. 
 - Fine. 
 We'll leave. 
 - No, no, it's too late for that. 
 I said we'll leave. 
 [COCKS RIFLE] 
 I don't want you to leave. 
 I want you to dig. 
 Sun's starting to heat up the sky, sir. 
 JOHN: Yeah. 
 All right. 
 That's enough. 
 Nobody said get out. 
 Yeah, not much point in that. 
 - I have children. 
 - So do I. 
 And from what I've seen, yours will be better off without you. 
 Where are you from? 
 California. 
 Figures... 
 [MUSIC] 
 I'm gonna leave these holes just like this. 
 Right here in the middle of my field. 
 And if you ever come back again, I'm gonna fill 'em. 
 You understand? 
 Thank you. 
 "Thank you" is not an answer. 
 Repeat what I say: I'm going back to California. 
 I'm going back to California. 
 Montana doesn't want you. 
 Montana doesn't want me. 
 I'm never coming back. 
 I swear. 
 I'm gonna hold you to that. 
 Don't think we'll be seeing them again. 
 Nope. 
 Want us to fill these holes? 
 They want to put an airport here. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 What do you want to do about it? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 Don't fill the holes. 
 - No? 
 - No. 
 - Rip? 
 - Sir. 
 Have the boys take down my tent at camp. 
 I'm moving back to the lodge. 
 You sure you want me to do that? 
 You might want to go up there some. 
 I'm sure. 
 My summer's over.
