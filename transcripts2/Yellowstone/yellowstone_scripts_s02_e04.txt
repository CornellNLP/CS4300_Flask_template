 Hey Jimmy. 
 Why don't you ride ahead and look for the next break? 
 Tell me about that kid. 
 Ah, he's green as the grass. 
 But he tries hard. 
 Good kid. 
 If he was a good kid he wouldn't be wearing the brand. 
 Yeah, well, he's a favor. 
 What about Walker... 
 he a favor too? 
 I just to know what I'm working with. 
 They don't work with you, Kayce. 
 They work for you. 
 These are questions you should be asking your father. 
 I'm asking you. 
 Yeah well, it ain't my place to say. 
 I guess that says it all. 
 Hey Jimmy. 
 He said ride the fence line. 
 Hey, this cow looks kinda funny. 
 - sh1t. 
 Hold on - Here. 
 Jimmy. 
 Gimme the Wonder Dust out of the saddlebag. 
 The what kind of dust? 
 It's wound dust. 
 Grab it out of the f*cking bag. 
 What's bloat? 
 Ate something he shouldn't. 
 What the f*ck did he bloat on,  the grass is dried and it didn't freeze last night. 
 They can't eat when it freezes? 
 Jimmy, quit askin' f*cking questions. 
 Go put it back. 
 Doesn't make any sense, Kayce. 
 There's no alfalfa in this field. 
 I never seen one bloat in the fall. 
 That's 'cuz they don't. 
 Oh, my God... 
 I thought we agreed on 10am. 
 She's worth the wait. 
 I'm breathless with anticipation. 
 Cassidy Reid is here. 
 - Morning. 
 - Hi. 
 - Pleasure. 
 - The pleasure's mine. 
 I'm a huge admirer. 
 - Cassidy. 
 - Mr. 
 Stewart. 
 - Hi Beth. 
 - Hi. 
 Cassidy Reid. 
 Jamie. 
 No other opponents submitted qualified petitions  before the deadline, which means the office is yours. 
 AG Stewart will step down immediately  and I will appoint you to the office  before the election, which you run unopposed,  which means... 
 welcome to the office, AG Reid. 
 Thank you, Governor. 
 I will serve Montana with pride. 
 And to the letter of the law. 
 Yeah... 
 We'll issue a press release  and schedule an official swearing in,  on what, Friday? 
 Friday's good for me. 
 How's Friday for you, Jamie? 
 Friday's fine. 
 Excuse me. 
 I think it's a good idea if I brief you  on some of the more pressing legal issues  facing the state prior to the swear-in. 
 Alright, let's dive in. 
 Okay... 
 I don't know where to start. 
 Dad? 
 Excuse me. 
 Who died? 
 Not who... 
 Mister Dutton. 
 Here's your culprit. 
 This is a crime scene. 
 Jamie. 
 Get livestock agents out here. 
 Everyone walk away from this area. 
 Brian. 
 You're not a reserve agent anymore. 
 You're on regular duty. 
 You find a way to cover this area. 
 I don't want a f*ckin' bird landing in it. 
 You. 
 Walk with me. 
 Now's not the time to talk about all the fights I'm in. 
 Right now, this is the only fight that matters. 
 You have any idea who did this? 
 I know exactly who did it. 
 Now we gotta go prove it... 
 You ever hear of the Beck brothers? 
 The Beck brothers? 
 Yeah, the Beck brothers. 
 They own about 300 gas stations with slot machines. 
 One of the brothers controls the sale of liquor licenses. 
 That could be a real problem. 
 They don't want our casino to happen. 
 The casino's mine. 
 And your hotel won't need their liquor license. 
 Once we annex the land,  the state has no control over anything we do. 
 We didn't agree to annexing the land. 
 You don't need to... 
 we own the land now. 
 That wasn't the deal... 
 -  - It's exactly the deal, Dan. 
 And for you, it's priceless. 
 There's no county permits to build. 
 The gaming license comes from the Tribal Gaming Commission,  as does your liquor license,  your permit to operate, and your hotel license... 
 When you sold me the land, Dan,  I gave you freedom from oversight. 
 Sidestepping those regulations  is going to anger a lot of people. 
 That puts him in danger. 
 Both of you. 
 That's why I have Mo. 
 Who do you have? 
 Surely you've learned by now... 
 we're the only ones playing by the rules. 
 What are you saying? 
 You saying I need security? 
 You've needed it for a while, Dan. 
 You should've learned that, too. 
 150 years ago,  our people called this land home. 
 We drank from its rivers,  we hunted its valleys,  we cared for our dead in these forests,  we prayed on these mountains. 
 This was our home. 
 And it nourished us. 
 You understand our contract with the reservation  is invalidated the moment they annex this land. 
 You familiar with the term indian giver? 
 Well this is the opposite. 
 The word you're looking for is justice. 
 By the power vested in me,  I hereby claim this land as property  of the Nation of Confederated Tribes  at Broken Rock. 
 If he doesn't keep his word I lose everything. 
 If you were him would you keep your word? 
 It's worth the risk if he is telling the truth. 
 Trusting him is not a business strategy. 
 Dan! 
 Come do the honors. 
 Great, now he's asking you to dig your own f*cking grave. 
 This is the beginning of something very special, Dan. 
 You watch what a difference we make. 
 Any endeavor that raises my people's profile  is a good one,  but I wonder... 
 how many casinos do we need? 
 Is this the right path for our future? 
 Are you challenging Chairman Rainwater's leadership? 
 I'm challenging his outlook,  and what's best for our people as a whole,  instead of a select few. 
 In an historic ground-breaking ceremony,  Tribal Chairman Thomas Rainwater  annexed the land purchased  for the Confederated Tribes of Broken Rock's  ambitious hotel & casino project  into the reservation. 
 There are now questions about what, if any,  authority the state will have over regulating  the casino or monitoring the construction  of what will be the largest hotel in the state. 
 Who's the contractor on this build? 
 I'll find out. 
 I thought we were pretty f*cking clear with Mr. 
 Jenkins. 
 Well evidently not. 
 We need to find a less subtle means  of expressing our displeasure. 
 Can we bait that trap? 
 I think it's time we spring it. 
 So you think this was intentional? 
 I don't see tire tracks anywhere. 
 The fence is way over there... 
 no one threw it over. 
 And it didn't fall out of the f*cking sky... 
 That's exactly what it did. 
 So you think someone flew a plane over here  and dropped clover on your cattle  in the middle of the night, John? 
 Think about that. 
 We have. 
 A King Air designed for skydiving  so it has a side door large enough  and could hold the weight. 
 Why would anyone do that, though? 
 Who would do that? 
 Your golfing buddy. 
 That's who. 
 All right, John. 
 Think that. 
 Now why the f*ck am I here? 
 I have no jurisdiction. 
 Cattle is your department. 
 What can I do for you. 
 I have six full-time agents and four reserves. 
 I don't have the manpower for this investigation. 
 I need your deputies... 
 John, I can't spare any deputies. 
 County has more firefighters sleeping at night  than I have on patrol... 
 You keep making my point. 
 You wanna help? 
 Give me deputies or deputize my men. 
 And not in six weeks... 
 right now. 
 Right in this field. 
 Which men? 
 Him for starters. 
 John, He put that drifter on a soup diet  and you want me to license him to carry a weapon?! 
 You mean the one who held a knife to his throat... 
 that drifter? 
 You gonna tell me that beating was worse  than some of your officers have doled out? 
 Hmm? 
 How many times have I stood on a podium with you, Donnie. 
 Stood for you. 
 Think you'd be sheriff if it weren't for me? 
 Maybe you haven't noticed,  but there's a war going on in this valley. 
 Today's the day you choose sides. 
 I'll issue the permit, but he's got to understand... 
 -  - He's trained to use it. 
 - That's just great, John. 
 Now you train him not to use it. 
 If it comes out of your holster, son,  you'd better be an ironclad reason, understood? 
 Yeah. 
 If he calls dispatch for support,  I expect you to give it to him. 
 Did you hear me Donnie? 
 I heard you Joh,  The whole goddamn valley heard you. 
 We all know who did this. 
 You find the evidence. 
 And when he does,  you drag him by the hair back to me. 
 I think we should ask for an amendment to the agreement. 
 - Something that... 
 - That what? 
 Should he pinky swear he won't f*ck me? 
 There's the skydiving place in Three Forks. 
 We're headed there now. 
 And then there's other two  Missoula and Whitefish. 
 That's too far. 
 Um, you didn't want to mention the trust? 
 Trust who? 
 The trust. 
 The ranch is in a trust. 
 It is? 
 Yeah, don't play dumb with me Kayce,  I'm looking at your signature right here. 
 I ain't signed sh1t. 
 All right. 
 Call me when you get to Three Forks. 
 My f*cking family, man... 
 f*ck. 
 What the f*ck, Beth? 
 Hi Jamie, It's Sarah. 
 I just wanted to confirm some facts with you... 
 Who's Sarah? 
 Jumpy, jumpy, jumpy. 
 What's got you so nervous, I wonder. 
 Well, you scared the f*cking sh1t out of me. 
 And I'll tell you what makes me nervous. 
 This. 
 Why a trust? 
 You're an attorney, Jamie. 
 I shouldn't have to explain it to you. 
 Okay. 
 Why am I not in it? 
 Do I really have to tell you that too, Jamie? 
 Here's all the things I don't believe:  I don't believe you're capable of swallowing your pride  and contributing to this family. 
 I don't believe our father will ever trust you again... 
 which is why I don't believe you have a role here anymore. 
 Oh. 
 You want to know what my role is? 
 Well I think you're putting it in a trust  so you can control the money. 
 So you can do this. 
 And this. 
 And this. 
 The ranch is an investor, yes. 
 How big an investor? 
 I manage the finances, Beth. 
 I need to know... 
 How big? 
 Five million. 
 I know, Jamie. 
 You're worried about the risk. 
 Two things: one... 
 the risk is mitigated;  two... 
 if you didn't have balls the size of quail eggs,  you would've invested this money years ago  and he wouldn't be chasing his f*cking tail every fall. 
 Good work. 
 Hey, Beth. 
 That is over half the ranch's cash. 
 What do we do in November if cattle prices go down? 
 How much money do you think this ranch makes a year? 
 After payroll and property taxes  and hay and countless other expenses?! 
 Nothing. 
 This ranch has not turned a profit in six years. 
 And maybe you don't understand the impact  of a few hundred dead cattle,  but that's half a million dollars rotting in the field. 
 You f*cked us. 
 f*cked us. 
 I want the ranch out and I want it out by today. 
 It doesn't work like that, Jamie  You make it work like that. 
 f*ck, now I see. 
 You Think you're gonna get him to trust you  by making him not trust me? 
 I wish you and your bird balls the best of luck. 
 Afternoon! 
 Can I help you? 
 Could you get a message to Jimmy? 
 What's the message? 
 This. 
 Piece of sh1t. 
 Tell him I want my f*cking money. 
 He's got a week. 
 How many total? 
 So far we've found 360 more. 
 Yeah they dropped bales all the way up the valley. 
 If we push the heard down here,  they're gonna get into that clover. 
 I say we move them up the pass. 
 Through the mountains. 
 That's an awful rough trail. 
 Rip's right. 
 We'll take them over the pass. 
 That goddamn clover's gonna take root. 
 Next spring it'll be worse. 
 We're gonna have to burn this field. 
 Just gotta be careful we don't start a f*cking forest fire. 
 We'll bring up water trucks. 
 I'll have the fire department out here, just in case. 
 I don't see any other way. 
 Burn it. 
 Yes sir. 
 Colby. 
 No horses. 
 I hate this f*cking thing. 
 Rip. 
 Who's the hell is that? 
 Oh, what the f*ck. 
 How much do you owe? 
 How much, Jimmy? 
 Around eight thousand. 
 I ain't got it. 
 I know you don't. 
 I'll get it. 
 They said a week. 
 Or I get this again. 
 I'll get it. 
 Cause of what we did, they beat him? 
 No, they beat him for what I did. 
 Has anyone heard the term " ocean water"? 
 It's a mixture of Lysol and water. 
 - Yeah, Genevieve. 
 - What do you do with it? 
 You drink it. 
 Why? 
 Because alcohol is illegal on the reservation. 
 Because it's cheap. 
 Because when people's lives are miserable,  they seek ways to escape the pain. 
 Ocean water is one way. 
 It's a temporary escape. 
 With painful repercussions. 
 But when the misery's bad enough,  tomorrow is rarely factored into decisions. 
 Uh, so think of yourselves as Sherlock Holmes. 
 And your job is to investigate the past,  to understand the present. 
 Can I help you? 
 Looking for John Dutton... 
 -  Yeah who's looking for John Dutton? 
 We don't know you. 
 What the f*ck is this guy up to... 
 Hey, step back. 
 Hey! 
 Come on m*therf*cker, shoot me. 
 Drop your weapon! 
 You're f*cking right. 
 Put it down. 
 Oh f*ck. 
 sh1t. 
 Mister Dutton,  seems all the stories I've heard are true. 
 Put it down, whoah. 
 Whoah, everybody calm down. 
 - Dad. 
 This is... 
 - Malcolm Beck. 
 This here is my brother, Teal. 
 I apologize for everything that's happened here. 
 Misunderstandings aside, we need to speak. 
 Seems there's a problem that we share. 
 My problems are squarely my own. 
 Not this one. 
 May we sit? 
 We can talk under that tree. 
 Uh-huh. 
 What in the Sam-Hell was that about? 
 I'm sorry. 
 They called fifteen minutes ago  I didn't know they meant now. 
 I'm taking this meeting alone. 
 I said alone, Jamie. 
 Don't you want to have your lawyer present? 
 This don't feel like a lawyer meeting. 
 I saw your son go against Peabody Coal before the Senate. 
 He's one hell of a litigator. 
 Yeah, he can argue with the best of them. 
 So, what's this problem? 
 A casino in this valley  will have a negative affect on our business. 
 And for your ranch and the others. 
 In five years, how many ranches like this  can afford to exist? 
 Wanna hear our guess. 
 Soon as that casino opens,  they'll approach the Forest Service about a land lease. 
 And they'll build a ski resort. 
 And you know as well as anyone,  ski resorts are daggers to the heart  for places like this. 
 It'll be an ocean of second homes in ten years. 
 I'm aware. 
 I'm sure you are. 
 Look, my office has no authority  over an Indian casino. 
 And yours has no authority over the land. 
 And your new AG can't restrict them. 
 That's why we need to fight this outside the lines. 
 We just don't think they have the stomach for that. 
 Yeah, well they have the stomach for it. 
 I don't need partners, fellas. 
 Dan Jenkins has a partner. 
 A big one. 
 Think of us as allies. 
 We'd be the perfect allies for each other, John. 
 Because there is no part of your business that benefits ours. 
 And vice versa. 
 And when we fight, it's a zero-sum game. 
 We will win. 
 At any cost. 
 Yeah. 
 John... 
 We just want you to consider it. 
 I consider every option, Malcolm. 
 And I choose the one that's best for my family. 
 If it helps you, it's a coincidence. 
 That's not the way you wear one of those. 
 Working with them is a deal with the devil, Dad. 
 All the angels are gone, son. 
 There's only devils left. 
 At least they admit it. 
 I'm impressed. 
 You're really preaching. 
 That's good. 
 Brushing up on your history? 
 Just curious. 
 Wanted to see you teach. 
 Glad I did. 
 Be careful, though. 
 If you only teach the tragedy, they'll just see us as tragic. 
 You should show them the culture. 
 Show them what we're fighting for. 
 And how do I do that. 
 I dunno. 
 Field trip, maybe? 
 Bring 'em out to the rez. 
 Everyone's getting ready for the relay races. 
 Can you think of a better way to show them who we are? 
 That's a really great idea, I'll um... 
 I'll talk to my administrator. 
 Your rehab's in fifteen. 
 Feel up to walking to the rec center? 
 Um, I-I can't. 
 I've got a faculty meeting. 
 I'll just call you and reschedule, okay? 
 Okay, Monica. 
 No telling where that son of a bitch got a plane. 
 Not from skydivers. 
 We're never going to find it this way. 
 He's smarter than that. 
 Pull over, would you? 
 Hey. 
 How are you? 
 I'm lonely, Kayce. 
 I can solve that problem. 
 I miss you. 
 
 
 
 Yeah, I miss you too. 
 You... 
 want me to come over? 
 Yeah. 
 But you can't. 
 I just... 
 Just wanted to hear your voice. 
 I love you, Monica. 
 God, I wish that was all it took. 
 Everything alright? 
 Nope. 
 The first thing we want you to look into. 
 is this Paradise Valley Development Corporation. 
 They've sold property to the Broken Rock Tribe,  which is attempting to annex it into the reservation. 
 We'd like you to file an injunction against it... 
 Can we contest that? 
 I mean they're clearly attempt to avoid state tax obligations  and regulatory requirements. 
 I'd say we have a good chance. 
 What about this Senate hearing regarding jurisdiction  violation by the Livestock Association? 
 Let me ask you a question, Attorney General-elect. 
 Do you find Jamie's knowledge of the raid  prior to it happening inculpatory in any way? 
 I'm concerned what happens if they ask him to testify. 
 Umm. 
 I think attorney-client privileges recuse of him. 
 Even if he's aware of a crime before it's happened. 
 Are you saying a crime was committed intentionally? 
 There was no crime. 
 Not the time. 
 Not the place. 
 The concern is... 
 the negative press surrounding the hearing  can create a ripple effect... 
 emboldening others to come forward with accusations  that may hold legal merit. 
 Our goal should be to avoid a hearing altogether. 
 How do you plan to do that? 
 I'm working on it, Commissioner. 
 Feels like suppertime. 
 Cassidy, would you care to join us? 
 - Oh, no I... 
 - We insist. 
 I'll show you the way. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Sharp as a tack, that one. 
 And what a looker. 
 My God. 
 She's going to make a great Attorney General. 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 I'm going to get you disbarred,  you spineless piece of sh1t. 
 You should never have come home. 
 You told me to come home. 
 Why on Earth would you ever listen to me? 
 That's fine, thank you. 
 That's Kayce's seat, Cassidy. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 It's fine. 
 That one's fine. 
 Okay. 
 Don't you f*ckin' dare. 
 Here, come sit next to me. 
 Have a seat, son. 
 Kayce's not back from Three Forks. 
 I thought he was. 
 Well how'd that go? 
 There was nothing there. 
 So your family's from Great Falls, right? 
 Yeah, the ranch is outside Lewiston. 
 Near Roundup, know where that is? 
 I do. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Is he okay? 
 He has Celiac Disease. 
 He gets an upset tummy. 
 He has what?? 
 Mama? 
 - Hey buddy. 
 - Daddy! 
 We've checked every manifest in every airstrip in the county. 
 Sweetgrass, too... 
 nothing. 
 He got that plane from somewhere, you go find it. 
 You'll be riding with Agent Hendon Today. 
 He knows the job. 
 Learn from him. 
 You don't need help around here? 
 Just find the planes, son. 
 Kayce. 
 If you find anything, don't confront anyone. 
 You call the sheriff for backup. 
 Everything by the book. 
 I don't know the book. 
 Well that's why you call the sheriff, son. 
 It's their book. 
 When did all this burn? 
 - Last year. 
 - Was it lightning? 
 A satellite fell out of the sky. 
 God sure finds interesting ways  to put people out of business. 
 108, there's a depredation report,  at the Paulson Ranch near Ennis. 
 Can we divert? 
 Copy that. 
 It's on the way. 
 We're en route. 
 We're supposed to be checking airstrips  not dead cows. 
 We're checking airstrips because of dead cows. 
 Paulson's cows ain't any less dead than yours. 
 Put a wire in to keep them from coming back  and eating all the evidence. 
 But then there's the eagles. 
 Haven't figured out how to keep them away. 
 Oh yeah. 
 Mm. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Whew. 
 Tell me that ain't wolves. 
 You called Fish & Wildlife? 
 Hell, they ain't coming. 
 Jerry Hayes, he's got the lease next mine. 
 That thief. 
 Every time he has a cow die  he hacks 'em up and blames wolves. 
 Now we actually have wolves running around  and he's cried wolf so much they ain't never gonna come out. 
 - You know Jerry Hayes? 
 - Uh-uh. 
 He's not worth knowing. 
 That's $1,800 I can't stand to lose. 
 We can get you compensated,  but Fish & Wildlife has to issue depredation tags. 
 I'd have some cowboys cover your herd for you. 
 Ain't got cowboys. 
 All I got is me. 
 Okay, well,  Looks like you're sleeping outside for a while then. 
 - Dispatch. 
 - Go ahead. 
 Have Polk County file a case... 
 What you do is rent you a couple of mules. 
 Turn em out with the herd. 
 It's what we do. 
 What kind of mules? 
 Mean ones. 
 Thanks. 
 Let's just forget this. 
 You have two calls in to them already man,  We got things to do and this ain't one of 'em. 
 Dispatch, what's the 20 on sheriff's deputies? 
 Goddamnit. 
 Sheriff's department says no units available. 
 I mean it, man. 
 Let's forget this. 
 Hey. 
 This is the job. 
 What do you want? 
 Heard you lost a cow to wolves. 
 Heard from who? 
 May we see it? 
 Fish & Wildlife already saw it. 
 - That's not what he asked. 
 - I'll handle this. 
 Where the f*ck are you going? 
 Jerry, just hold up here a second. 
 Found your wolf. 
 Hey Jerry. 
 I've been waiting a long time to say this:  but you're under arrest. 
 So I want you to turn around and put your hands  above your head and I want you to do it now. 
 Jerry. 
 Jerry! 
 Stop! 
 Ahhhh! 
 Jerry! 
 Is this necessary? 
 He's resisting. 
 Ahhhh! 
 Let him f*cking go now. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Easy. 
 Easy, whoa, whoa. 
 Calm down. 
 Everybody stop. 
 Listen to me. 
 Your dad is gonna go to county jail. 
 they'll take his fingerprints they're gonna take his picture,  and then then let him go. 
 In six months from now he's gonna stand before a judge,  who makes him pay a fine  and then pick up trash on the weekend. 
 Is it worth killing us over that? 
 Look at me. 
 Does that seem fair to you. 
 Luke... 
 - Put it down. 
 - Hey, no. 
 Down, put it down! 
 I got it under control. 
 Drop! 
 Drop drop! 
 sh1t. 
 Nooo! 
 God. 
 I had no choice. 
 Yeah you keep telling yourself that. 
 Goddamnit! 
 You had a choice. 
 Goddamnit. 
 Yeah? 
 What? 
 Who pulled the trigger? 
 I don't have a gun. 
 Not what I asked. 
 It wasn't me. 
 Was it justified? 
 He's got a freaked out kid pointing a shotgun at him. 
 Yeah, it was justified. 
 But was it right? 
 Right and wrong is so far from this place,  I don't think it factors in at all. 
 I told you to call the sheriff for backup... 
 We did, sir. 
 We did multiple times. 
 The requests were denied. 
 But it was still my call. 
 My god. 
 There's no good choices in a situation like this, Steve. 
 What did I say, John? 
 One f*cking day on patrol. 
 One day... 
 You gave me your word, Donnie. 
 And you broke it. 
 All this over a cow, a f*cking cow, John? 
 A f*cking cow. 
 It's not over a f*cking cow. 
 It's over you not giving backup. 
 You denied the request. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 A show of force would have maybe  changed this whole f*cking thing. 
 So you want to blame somebody? 
 The you blame yourself, you son of a bitch. 
 According to the livestock commissioner,  sheriff's deputies refused a request  to support the livestock agents  as they investigated false claims of cattle depredation  at convicted felon Jerry Hayes' ranch,  just east of Three Forks. 
 Whatever administrative lapses occurred,  the result is one man in custody  and his teenage boy, dead. 
 I know how we can help John Dutton. 
 Everything alright? 
 Burn it. 
 Let's go. 
 Light it up.
