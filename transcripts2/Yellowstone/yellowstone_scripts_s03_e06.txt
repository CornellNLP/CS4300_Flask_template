 [GOATS BLEATING] 
 Breakfast is ready, let's go. 
 Where's your sister? 
 Sila! 
 Come on. 
 That girl... 
 Come on. 
 Let's... 
 [MUSIC] 
 Hey, Crystal. 
 Sila didn't spend the night there last night, did she? 
 No? 
 No, she didn't come home. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello, Jim. 
 Sila isn't over there, is she? 
 Well, you let me know if she comes by. 
 DANA: What time did Sila drop her off? 
 And she said she was coming straight home? 
 DEREK: Sila! 
 Sila! 
 OPERATOR:    . 
 What's your emergency? 
 [MUSIC] 
 [MUSIC CONTINUES] 
 [GOAT BLEATS] 
 [CHATTERING] 
 So, we found her car about    miles from here. 
 Ran out of gas. 
 There's no sign of a struggle, so my guess is she either hitched a ride or tried to walk it. 
 There's no telling which, so for now we're assuming both. 
 I need to put together a search. 
 Tom, and I don't have the manpower. 
 I'll make some calls. 
 Now, you checked with all her friends? 
 Everybody. 
 [EXHALES] 
 At this point, I don't know what her chances are. 
 [MUSIC] 
 You know exactly what her chances are, Ben. 
 Who is he? 
 Just a horse trading, lying... 
 half a criminal. 
 Rip, push those cattle up to the field above the new barn. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Y'all listen up, if those sons of bitches say anything to you, you don't react, you hear me? 
 Cool heads. 
 Understood? 
 This b*st*rd will try and test you. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Long time, John. 
 Not long enough for me, you son of a bitch. 
 What happened to cool heads? 
 I didn't mean me. 
 What scam are you running today? 
 No scam. 
 We're babysitting them bison for the resort. 
 Resort's in the buffalo business now? 
 They're in the tourist business. 
 Charge     dollars for people to ride up here on a dude string and have pictures taken of 'em. 
 These been tested for Brucellosis? 
 Got a whole army now, I see. 
 He's always got an army. 
 Don't you, John? 
 Papers are good. 
 Why didn't you show him that the other day? 
 'Cause I didn't like the way he asked. 
 I don't want to see them things on our side of the fence. 
 Law says it's not our job to keep 'em from getting in. 
 It's your job to keep 'em from getting out. 
 You should know that, Commissioner. 
 Oh, I'll keep 'em out. 
 But you're gonna f*cking hate the way I do it. 
 We're a little long in the tooth for old feuds, Wade. 
 Without old feuds I got none at all. 
 And where's the fun in that? 
 Let's go. 
 [MUSIC] 
 [FOOTSTEPS] 
 Going to a funeral? 
 Um, Helena. 
 - Got work to do. 
 - Mm. 
 Won't work Saturdays for us, but you're sure working for yourself. 
 Enough of this sh1t. 
 Uh-oh, I've made him mad, and he's not going to take it anymore. 
 Let's just skip straight to the problem. 
 The real problem... between us. 
 It's too early in the morning to dig up that skeleton, Jamie. 
 Well, I'm digging it up anyway. 
 You know what is so f*cking dangerous about you? 
 Is you actually believe that you're helping. 
 Like, in your heart, you believe that. 
 But you refuse to look at the results of your help. 
 You refuse to acknowledge the carnage that your "help" leaves behind. 
 Because as a man you are broken. 
 Your soul, your mind is broken. 
 And, it's not your fault, I guess. 
 He made you into something you had no business being. 
 I guess that's why he did it. 
 But there's just no right or wrong with you. 
 Just his approval. 
 That's all that matters to you. 
 That's all you are. 
 But his disapproval, man, and how much you fear it? 
 That is what makes you truly evil, Jamie. 
 And you are evil. 
 You know that. 
 You have to know that. 
 All... 
 All I have ever tried to do is protect this family. 
 Most of the time, from itself. 
 You more than anyone should understand that. 
 I'm going to tell you a little secret: the more you become what he wanted you to become, the more he'll hate you for it. 
 And he does hate you for it. 
 We all do. 
 [MUSIC] 
 I should've said no. 
 That's what I should've done. 
 Because then you couldn't blame me for doing exactly what you asked me to do. 
 I didn't ask you for a f*cking hysterectomy. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 You know, when you consider the pain that you cause a person the person's fault... 
 that's evil, Jamie. 
 [MUSIC] 
 [TURBINES WINDING DOWN] 
 Thank you. 
 You said this would be simple. 
 It should have been. 
 "Should" is a useless word. 
 Almost as useless as "hope."

 These barrel racers is hands, I'll say that. 
 Could you toss me a water, babe? 
 Thank you, sugar. 
 Damn. 
 Two dances. 
 Here, I'm hauling them to the arena, saddling their horses, sitting in the bleachers watching 'em. 
 Now I'm the damn buckle bunny. 
 You guys didn't, uh... 
 'Course not. 
 She ain't even    years old. 
 I need a barrel racer in my life like I need another hemorrhoid. 
 But here I am anyway, toting her sh1t around. 
 That's a lot of woman you got there. 
 She's gonna want more than you can offer living in a bunkhouse. 
 Rodeo was supposed to be my way out of the bunkhouse. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Rodeo's as bad on relationships as cowboying. 
 Can't be married to two things at the same time, Jimmy. 
 That's what got you banged up in the first place... 
 was thinking about her instead of that rocket you was getting on. 
 Mr. Dutton says I can't do it anymore anyway. 
 He told me that too, once. 
 Right after he paid a stack of my hospital bills. 
 But the only one that can decide if you rodeo is you. 
 Maybe I can just do another event. 
 - Team rope, maybe. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 You can't rope a post with a ten foot loop. 
 But you can sit a bucking horse like nothin' I ever seen. 
 Least well since I quit, anyway. 
 I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
 You gotta leave your brain out of it, decide with your heart. 
 It's the only way you'll ever have peace with it. 
 When did you decide to quit? 
 My body decided for me. 
 Now, it's all I can do to get out of bed every morning. 
 I miss it. 
 Yeah. 
 I miss it too. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Thank you. 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Commissioner Dutton. 
 It's funny how I can say the same thing and it mean three different people in just as many weeks. 
 Yeah, well, the more things change, you know. 
 I certainly hope they don't stay the same. 
 Me, too. 
 What can I do for you? 
 We've got a missing person. 
 We always have a missing person, but we never have the resources to find them. 
 I'm getting pretty tired of that staying the same. 
 Well, I'm not sure how much help I can be, but you've got it, if that's what you're asking for. 
 I got three agents close by. 
 Be there in three hours. 
 Three more is something. 
 Are you just looking for badges or do you need volunteers, too? 
 We're putting together volunteer groups as well. 
 I'll make a call. 
 See if I can't get you some more. 
 Thank you. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Appreciate you meeting us. 
 My pleasure. 
 This is Market Equities' CEO. 
 - I'm Willa Hayes. 
 - Jamie Dutton. 
 Where should we start? 
 That's a really good question, Jamie. 
 I don't have the answer. 
 I really don't know. 
 We could start with your sister's firm shorting our stock to the point it has become a Wall Street play. 
 - Doing what? 
 - We could start there. 
 We could start with being appointed to an office that could very well be tasked with condemning your family's property, but that's an obscene conflict of interest. 
 I think it's a bit premature to talk condemnation. 
 You haven't made an offer on the land. 
 The State is buying the land. 
 The State hasn't approved that. 
 And to approve such a purchase, the State would require a bond initiative proposed and voted on by the assembly before being placed on the fall ballot. 
 And yet, here you are, demanding that the State violate its own procedures while you accusing the governor of violating procedure. 
 Thousands of jobs. 
 Thousands of low paying service jobs. 
 Skilled labor, I'm sure, will come from out of state. 
 Which will drive the home prices even higher, if that's possible. 
 You're pricing people out of the valley. 
 They're already priced out of the valley. 
 That's not my doing. 
 It's called economic evolution. 
 - I disagree. 
 - You don't disagree. 
 You just don't want it to be true. 
 I have a proposal. 
 I'm all ears. 
 Rather than the State buying the land, I'm gonna make you an offer. 
 Your fifty thousand acres for ten thousand dollars an acre. 
 That's five hundred million dollars. 
 You'll never be priced out of anything... 
 ever again. 
 Don't answer me now. 
 Let that number sink in. 
 We'll discuss this again at our meeting with the governor. 
 [MUSIC] 
 You see that look? 
 Desire. 
 Right? 
 We'll close him. 
 I don't think he's the hard one to close. 
 I'd leave them weapons in the truck. 
 We ain't enforcing no laws today. 
 That's good thinking. 
 I can get a few more up here if you want. 
 It's appreciated. 
 This is all I could wrangle. 
 Wish there were more. 
 It all helps. 
 All right, folks, listen up. 
 Everybody stays ten feet apart. 
 You scan the area around you. 
 No, don't just look for Sila, right? 
 You look for clothes, footprints, a phone, a set of keys. 
 If you find something, do not touch it. 
 You stand over it, and you shout "hey," and you wave your arm. 
 An officer will come to you. 
 All right, let's go. 
 [CAR STARTS] 
 [MUSIC] 
 Do you know her? 
 I know her. 
 Good kid. 
 But this only happens to good kids. 
 [WHISTLE] 
 Is that a wolf? 
 Coyote. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Tell them not to come any closer. 
 Everybody stop. 
 Stand where you are, please. 
 What's happening, did they find something? 
 They found something. 
 The scene is yours, Ben. 
 Let's go tell her mother. 
 Set up a crime perimeter. 
 [MUSIC] 
 ♪ Guy on a buffalo ♪     
 ♪ One day the guy on the buffalo was romping around ♪  
 ♪ In a pasture faster than he looks ♪     
 This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. 
 Oh, it's so good. 
 You just don't appreciate quality film making. 
 I mean, I feel like he just looks like some kind of like sexy Jesus on the buffalo riding to the... 
 - No one knows what you're saying. 
 - ... sunset. 
 No one can understand you. 
 You understand what I'm saying about you. 
 - We don't hear you. 
 - You understand. 
 How is he staying on that f*cking thing? 
 - Well, it can't buck. 
 - Really? 
 Can't buck, can't rear up. 
 But they can roll over on your ass. 
 That's unbelievable. 
 I need this whole dynamic explained to me. 
 It must be the wobble of the Earth, creating a magnetic shift... 
 Hey, hey, this is where he gets shot. 
 Look out. 
 Look out! 
 Hey, we oughta ride the buffalo out there on that field. 
 Wait, what field? 
 Out back there behind the corral. 
 Where are your corrals? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 She speaks, they understand her. 
 - How is that even possible? 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 It's the wobble of the Earth, I'm trying to tell you. 
 There ain't no buffalo out in the field by the corrals. 
 There's about thirty. 
 The resort put them there for tourists to look at. 
 And they got this mean old b*st*rd watching them. 
 - What was his name? 
 - Wade something. 
 - Wade... 
 - Morrow. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah, they're his buffalo. 
 Who feels like riding a buffalo? 
 Uh. 
 Not me. 
 Yeah, I would, but, uh... 
 [GUNSHOT SOUNDS] 
 
 
 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not supposed to drink and ride buffalos. 
 - It's a whole thing. 
 - f*ck it, I'll ride a buffalo. 
 Yeah, we'll ride the buffalo. 
 - You ladies can watch. 
 - Yes! 
 - This is gonna be fun. 
 - Woo! 
 Wait. 
 This is happening? 
 Looks like it. 
 I've done some dumb sh1t in my life. 
 ♪ I'm on a buffalo ♪    
 This is gonna be dumber. 
 Well, what's the best way to do this? 
 Well, you can't rope them around the neck. 
 You'll crush their larynx. 
 So you gotta rope them by their horns. 
 And then what? 
 And then you pull them to a stop. 
 You jump on and off you go... 
 I'm just here to watch. 
 - I'll do it. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 Yeah. 
 We can't be sober for this. 
 TATER: sh1t, what a baby bunch.

 [KNOCKS] 
 Hey. 
 Feeling any better? 
 It's just not right. 
 No, it's not. 
 There's monsters everywhere in this world. 
 You just gotta kill them when you find them. 
 But you can't find them. 
 Hell, they don't even have enough police to look for the victims. 
 And here I am, sitting in this swimming pool of a bathtub. 
 You can't make it your fault, baby. 
 I'm not making it my fault. 
 I'm making it my problem. 
 You know we can't stop the world from being bad, Monica. 
 Doesn't mean we shouldn't try. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Good morning, Daddy. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Have you been practicing yoga? 
 Practicing what? 
 I'm just trying to understand this new inner peace you've found. 
 [SIGHS] 
 What this place is facing... 
 it isn't an enemy. 
 It's a perspective. 
 It's a shift in values. 
 The world doesn't value your way of life anymore, Dad. 
 I know. 
 You can't delegate this fight to f*ckin' Jamie. 
 Okay, and... 
 Kayce, he just doesn't have the patience or the skill. 
 And... 
 I can't do it by myself. 
 But you have to, honey. 
 You have to teach Kayce. 
 And you have to learn how to trust Jamie. 
 Trust Jamie? 
 Wait, you're the... 
 you're the one telling I shouldn't trust Jamie. 
 What does it matter, Beth, if I keep this place for another ten years and the three of you lose it - because you couldn't figure it out? 
 - No, no. 
 - Beth... 
 - You don't know him! 
 And what is it you know, Beth, that the rest of us don't? 
 What did he do, Beth? 
 What did he do? 
 I can't help you, Beth, if you won't tell me what it is. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Pull over, Mo. 
 What are you doing? 
 Looking for clues. 
 Trying to help. 
 The only thing you're going to find out here is exactly what she found. 
 That's not gonna help anything. 
 It's not fair. 
 No. 
 It certainly isn't. 
 But it was designed that way. 
 From the beginning. 
 We're not supposed to be here. 
 Reservations were supposed to be temporary. 
 We were supposed to learn how to be white and then go live in cities and then this land would be sold, too. 
 But we didn't learn to be white. 
 Wouldn't. 
 And now here we are. 
 The government won't help because it doesn't want to. 
 It wants us to die. 
 It wants us gone. 
 Because it wants the land. 
 And that's all it's ever wanted. 
 That's why I want our land back. 
 All of it. 
 So we can build lives that they can't take away. 
 How do I help? 
 I'm forming a council to focus on violence against women on the reservation. 
 It will take our stories to the universities. 
 To Congress. 
 To anyone who will listen. 
 Our first fight is against being ignored. 
 Would you like to lead that fight? 
 I could lead that fight. 
 That's how you help. 
 [MUSIC] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Oh, good. 
 I need to talk to you about something. 
 The Market Equities Group made an... 
 Of all the promises I've made in my life, son. 
 If I didn't love your mother so much... 
 I'd break it. 
 I swear to God I would break it. 
 Did something happen? 
 I don't understand. 
 What happens in thirty years, Jamie? 
 When you, and your brother and sister are too old to fight for this place and Tate has to fight for it on his own? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Lee wouldn't marry, didn't want children. 
 I doubt you will either. 
 And now your sister can't. 
 She can't because of you. 
 - Dad, wait. 
 Wait! 
 - Quit moving! 
 I didn't. 
 I... 
 f*ck. 
 She came to me. 
 She was scared. 
 I was scared. 
 Why would you take that from her, Jamie? 
 Who the f*ck did you think you were to take that from her? 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 Ask your brother. 
 [MUSIC] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What the hell? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 All I do is give! 
 I hate him. 
 I f*cking hate him. 
 I f*cking hate you! 
 [SOBBING] 
 [MUSIC] 
 [MUSIC] 
 It's all for nothing. 
 Everything I've done. 
 It's... 
 It's all for nothing.
