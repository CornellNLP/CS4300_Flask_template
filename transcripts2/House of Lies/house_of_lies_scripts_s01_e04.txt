 Yeah, I know, I know. 
 But let me just lay out the case. 
 The case... you have an engagement in San Francisco. 
 At the last minute, your father zooms off to speak to a bunch of swooning Jungian analysts is taos. 
 Oh, Jesus! 
 So you call your ever-dependable/psychotic ex-wife. 
 [Seagulls squawk] 
 Dependable, that is, in her psychosis. 
 So next thing you know, you're taking him to work with you. 
 And there it is. 
 Case solved. 
 sh1t! 
 Frisco's got the best food trucks. 
 I am so ready to try some street meat. 
 [Chuckles] Okay, let's rephrase that, all right? 
 Now, listen. You're gonna be meeting some people in there, and I want you to remember that home stuff is private. 
 I gotcha, dad. 
 I'm just happy to be skipping school. 
 Yeah, about school... 
 Great. 
 Grandpa told you? 
 Yeah, he told me. 
 You didn't. 
 What's going on in school? 
 Nothing. 
 Roscoe. 
 A couple of kids started this thing about me at lunch. 
 Who? 
 Nobody. 
 I got to call principal Gita. 
 No Gita, please. 
 I just want to go to Frisco and chill, okay? 
 Okay, then we'll chill. 
 But don't say "Frisco," all right? 
 Only losers say Frisco. 
 We're not losers. Am I right? 
 Right. 
 All right, give it up. 
 Switch. 
 So now that we're engaged, I think we should have a party. 
 My mom will love that sh1t. 
 Your mom will love anything with free-flowing booze. 
 My mom giving my dad a blow job before I've even had my eggs? 
 Yeah. Sorry. 
 But really, who cares what your mom loves? 
 We're not doing this for them. 
 Just family and friends. 
 Like, I can finally meet all these guys I share you with every week. 
 Ooh. 
 If you met them, you'd rethink. 
 And you're gonna miss your flight. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Okay. I love you. Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Think about it. 
 I will. 
 I... I... I am listening to you. 
 You're not. 
 It's impossible not to. 
 Listen... you're yelling... 
 Blanca is a ten-pointer. 
 Hello. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 Because a ten-pointer requires a ruling from a disinterested party. 
 You're an idiot. 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 Wait, Jeannie? 
 Completely uninterested. 
 Perfect. 
 And we have our judge. 
 Thank you so much, Jeannie. 
 Subject, Blanca Garcia, AKA one hot piece of TSA ass. 
 Now, as you know, Blanca's TSA status automatically makes my odds of success exponentially lower than some sort of airport bar pickup. 
 So why don't you go ahead and give me... 
 Three points. Yeah. 
 Three points. 
 Now, her initial response was "no," which I could not believe 'cause I got all this... 
 I can believe it. 
 And all this. 
 All right, get to the point, Clyde. 
 I dusted off my backup game... shush, shush. 
 Turned that no into a coy little, "I get off at 5:00." 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Now, as you know, reversing a "no" is worth... 
 Three points. 
 Would you get to the end? 
 Later on that night, came back to my place, I straight up rocked her world. 
 Once, twice... 
 Okay. 
 Paused... three times. 
 I don't believe you. 
 You don't believe it? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Okay, fine. 
 She sent me this video. 
 Holy sh1t, man! 
 Yeah. 
 Two points for the clothes, two for the video. 
 And the judge rules... 
 Ay, Dios mio. 
 Blanca's a ten. 
 Yeah. 
 Forward that to me. 
 I can forward it to you easy. 
 For those keeping score at home, I'm officially up 23 points. 
 All right, listen, do you want to know why your score is so high? 
 Because you try to hump anything with a  Jinny,  all right? 
 Douglas, you say  Jinny? 
 Yes. 
 Regardless, the reason why I'm winning is because I don't get bogged down in the romance. 
 I like romance. 
 What I do is I tap that ass, shake it off, and move on. 
 You're a s*x offender. 
 I tap and move, grasshopper. 
 Just tap it... 
 What are we tapping? 
 Team, this is Roscoe. 
 Roscoe, this is... this is the team. 
 Wow. Hey, you looking forward to Frisco, little man? 
 I heard you absolutely slayed it as Rizzo. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I brought the house down. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 We're playing Jacks with another kid this week. 
 20-year-old CEO Alex Katsnelson of NinjaKatz Technologies. 
 Created the security software NKT. 
 Yeah, the best hacker since Meitzer. 
 A Harvard man too, so check it. 
 No one's gonna check it. 
 Now, the board wants to expand internationally without Alex. 
 But Alex wants us to prove that he's an asset.  The  asset. 
 Okay? 
 Got to skin this pig. 
 Afterwork. Afterwork. 
 Jiggity-jig. 
 Is this how you roll on the road? 
 Big pimpin', right? 
 Yeah. I could definitely get used to it, but... 
 What exactly do you guys do? 
 Ooh... 
 [Big band music plays] 
 That is the one question that we management consultants hate. 
 So we have become lords of the dance. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 See, companies hire us to solve the case, you know, fix whatever it is that's making them suck. 
 So we come in and we give 'em advice. 
 It's something we call wags. 
 Wild-ass guesses. 
 You good at it? 
 Oh, I'm very good at it. 
 Hey, you know what, buddy, you cannot come in here... 
 Uh, let me give you a couple bucks. 
 Get some stuff out of the machine. 
 You're hungry, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Not too much sugar. 
 Stay right there. 
 Go on ahead. 
 Don't say sh1t. 
 So... a chick, a Jew, a WASP, and a black guy walk into an office. 
 [Chuckles] You are a charmer. 
 I'm Marty Kaan. 
 We're the team from Galweather, and we are charging you a king's ransom, so we don't want to waste a lot of time playing games. Okay? 
 That's fine with me. 
 Here's the deal. 
 NKT was revolutionary. 
 This is truth. 
 You were positioned to take over the international market, and now the board wants to kick you off the f*ckin' train. 
 Ridiculous. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You. The one who started this whole thing from your dorm room while spankin' the monkey before your 8:00. 
 Oh, God, he's taking me back. 
 Me too. 
 Marty, let's get something straight. 
 I don't want to have some sort of corporate capitalist dick fight with the board, 'cause that's not me. 
 Clearly. 
 No. 
 But I want you to make them see that I am ninja. 
 You, you're ninja. Yeah. 
 It's him. 
 Because those corporate assholes, they'll listen to corporate ass kissers. 
 That's for sure. 
 Well, sir, you're in luck, because we are those ass kissers. 
 Hell, Mr. Katsnelson, if you want us to  lick  ass, we will... 
 I mean, we're kind of cut from the same cloth. 
 All right, look, here's what we're gonna do. 
 Why don't you guys... why don't you guys work off-site. 
 Let's keep suspicions down. 
 But if you guys really want to know what ninja's all about, I think, uh, somebody should probably roll with me. 
 I'm thinking blondie... 
 Guess I'm rolling with you. 
 You? Okay. That works. 
 Right. Well, who's gonna look after the kid? 
 Both : Not it. 
 Not it as well. sh1t. 
 Hey, so, Roscoe, you playing a little arcade game there on the... on your thing? 
 Yeah. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 But do you want me to... 
 Come with? 
 Dude, I'm ten. 
 Right. Of course. 
 Okay, well, hey, pound it out. 
 Don't leave me... hanging. 
 You left me hanging. 
 f*ck, even your kid game is weak. 
 It is not. 
 It is. 
 Not. 
 Yeah, I designed this whole thing myself. 
 I was going with sexy tech. 
 Girls love the sexy tech. 
 Trust me on that one. 
 So down here is basically just, like, special-Ops team. 
 It's, like, 100 Alexes walking around making me  mon-ay! 
 Cha-motherfuckin'-ching, baby! 
 [Pistol cocks, gunshot] 
 It's just dumb! 
 Come on. Let's go in here. 
 ♪ Gonna spend my  mon-ay  on some little toys ♪ 
 Oh, there she is. 
 Hello there. 
 Hey, baby. 
 I brought some very nice pieces from our store collection. 
 Yeah, I see that. 
 And perhaps you're interested in purchasing a piece of jewelry, mister... 
 Uh, Marty Kaan. 
 How 'bout I make you two drinks while you guys take a look? 
 You know what, that sounds great. 
 You know where the bar is, babe. 
 I do. 
 Thank you so much. 
 So you don't have any allies on the NinjaKatz board. 
 Ah, no. They all stopped talking to me after the Matrix deal. 
 Bunch of crybabies, right? 
 Can you believe that? 
 Two years ago, a girl like that wouldn't even talk to me. 
 Look at me now, right? 
 Yeah, she's all over you. 
 It's probably because I got the black in the pants. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 The black card. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, that sh1t's a pussy magnet, I'm telling you. 
 And I'm, like, this close to just... mm! 
 Hittin' that. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Yeah.  Word! 
 I'm thinking hardwood floors. 
 Nah, that's a manicured lawn going on down there. 
 No, no, come on. 
 So out of touch. 
 Do me a favor. 
 Look at her arms. 
 No hair. Do you see hair? 
 No. 
 She's Armenian. 
 Those fuckers are hairy. 
 Huh. 
 So what that tells me is no hair on the arms means laser hair removal. 
 You know, man, [Indistinct] v*g1n*! 
 Good deduction. 
 Yeah. 
 So... 
 See anything you like? 
 Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. 
 Really. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Wow, it appears Matrix was a monster deal. 
 A $6 billion monster deal that Alex killed with a weapon called micromanagement. 
 So then Matrix hooked up with ninja's biggest competitor. 
 Daddy, wait a second. 
 Are you wearing a new bracelet? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Yes. Yes, I are. 
 It's tasteful. 
 Not too "look at me!" 
 All right, I'll play. 
 Why? 
 Oh, it's just because I'm minding my own damn business, Doug. You? 
 Yeah. Same. 
 Don't poke the bear when he's hungry. 
 He was a nightmare on Jenny Craig. 
 [Laughs] God! 
 Really? 
 Really? 
 Was it water weight or regular weight? 
 Listen, we need to start chunking out the journeyline here. 
 Okay, Alex is obviously a bottleneck. 
 And if he keeps running NinjaKatz, he's gonna ruin international expansion. 
 So he gots to go. 
 But here's the interesting part. 
 We gots to stay. 
 Oh, my God, so you want us to talk him into leaving his own company... 
 And then get him to ask the board to give us the afterwork. 
 Mm, sometimes you are the perfect man. 
 Thank you. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 Alex wants to hang tonight,  dawg. 
 Now, is that d-o-g or... 
 No. 
 It's gonna be d-a-w-g.

 Marty, so what we personally believe in is the freeing of information from the corporate overlords, 'cause that's not right, you know. 
 And me and DJ right here, we wrote a manifesto and sh1t.

 So be suave, ideals... 
 That's a good one. 
 You don't even have to write it down because this is all you need to know. 
 Whenever you have any question of what you should be doing, just ask yourself this... what would Clooney do? 
 Right. Right. 
 Okay, okay. 
 And what  would  Clooney do? 
 He would tap that f*ckin' ass!

 What if there is this kid, and some big fat kid with a thyroid problem who picked on him at lunch, and the kid's grandpa said just to ignore it, but the kid just wanted to f*ck the little thyroid bitch up? 
 Huh. You know, I actually had a case like this a few years back. 
 There was this kid who, I mean, he was handsome. 
 Not in the classic sense, but handsome. 
 And smart. 
 Ooh, was he smart.
