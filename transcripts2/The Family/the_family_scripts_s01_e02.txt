 Previously on "The Family"...  
 You Nina Meyer? 
 Yeah. And who are you? 
 I'm him. 
 Reporter :  The young man identified himself as the youngest Warren child. 
 Though a body was never found, the Warrens' neighbor was convicted for Adam's murder. Hank : I didn't take that little boy's ship. I don't even know how it got there. Man : Mr. Asher was bullied into taking a plea deal. I'd like to grant you $30,000 a year for each year that you served. Nina : Tell me about the man in the woods. Adam : He has holes in his face. What about the place he kept you in? What could you see? A red dragon. He was breathing fire. Right at me. Nina : All deep woods, hardly populated. This is our search area. Hands up! On your knees! Thought you said it was legal now! What the... ? Danny, you don't recognize me? Bridey Cruz. High school. ♪ The doctor at City Memorial who verified Adam Warren's DNA test. He doesn't exist. Wherever you're going right now, I am asking you not to. I am announcing my candidacy for governor... [Cheers and applause] There's something off about him. He's different. What if it's not him? ♪ Adam :  They say once you've left home... you can never go back. The same house... the same rooms... but nothing's the same. ♪ Dishcloths... silverware... plates... cereal. Dishcloths... silverware... plates... cereal. Dishcloths, silverware, plates, cereal. ♪ My name is Adam Warren. And I came back. But I didn't come home. Claire : Hey, mister. Slow down. Danny : I'm hungry. But you need to come up for air, too. Wow. Cute, huh? Well, if by "cute," you mean "vaguely upsetting." [Gasps, chuckles] Do I have to go to this thing today? You're going, mister. Oh, no, it's no big deal, John. If the kids want to do their own thing... Honey, you spent the best years of your life making us demonic bananas. [Chuckles] The least we could do is get you elected to City Council. [Chuckles] It's your dream. Let's make it happen, huh? Oh. Oh, Adam, you'll miss the bus again. Lunch! Bye, sweetie. Have a good day. [Smooches] Bye. How does he keep missing it? The stop's right there. [Door closes] Hank : Here's where you went wrong. Adam : What? Too much glue on the stay. That's why your mast is jammed. [Thunder rumbles] [Chuckles] You'll get it. All right, you better go. Okay. Are you coming to the rally later? I don't know. They're gonna have cotton candy. [Brakes squeal] Better go. You'll miss your bus again. Bye, Hank. Bye, Adam. [Thunder rumbles] [Bus departs] [Thunder crashes] [Sighs] Is Adam up? Why? Do you need him for another press conference? I was going to tell you. Well, before or after you moved into the governor's mansion? I was going to tell you I was running the night before I announced, but you weren't home. I didn't have a chance. No, that's for Adam. All of it? He never got treats down there. No one's ever gonna squeeze  him  into a hole again. He's been through a lot, so let's just try and make things as routine and normal for him as we can. Sure thing. Cops are here. Nina : We've got officers on both ends of the street. Nobody's getting near the house without us knowing. What about the press? They're pushed behind the perimeter. You can relax. Sure, we'll kick back. So, why isn't he in custody yet? We're working on that. And what if you're wrong? We've been here before. Claire. I want the guy caught! So do I. What are you gonna do to him? When you catch him. ♪ Are you gonna hurt him? Oh, no, don't you worry. We're gonna keep you safe from now on. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna go back to normal, okay? Okay. [Sighs] ♪ The kid was in a basement for 10 years. Is his brain mashed potatoes or what? This is a human-interest story. One of you please make me cry. The rest of you, work the governor's side, Warren's platform. Every inch of this thing needs to be probed. All right. Danish? Oh, don't Danish me until you find that DNA doctor. The hospital outsourced the test to a genetics lab. So he  does  exist. Not exactly. He threw himself in front of a train two days after verifying the kid's DNA. It's a coincidence. Convenient. Gonna need more. Claire : Take him to the mall. The Farmington one. It should be quiet there. There won't be any press. And, um... buy him some new shoes, take him to lunch. Maybe catch a movie. A movie? A little fun wouldn't hurt. Bye. Bye. I'll see you later. Have fun. Okay? Got it? Movie. Movie. Movies cost money. Okay, I got it. You got the taillight fixed, Danny. [Door closes] Yeah, only took him three years. I need to get gas, too. [Door opens] Hang on. She wants me to take him to a movie. [Birds chirping] [Door creaks] [Sighs] [Chuckles] Hi. Hi. Remember me? I'm the guy that killed you. John : Adam?! Get in the car, okay? Come on. ♪ Hi. Hi, there! Hi. Hi, there. Um, I'm Claire Warren, and I'm running for City Council. Have a nice day. ♪ Hi! You came. Nina : You didn't see him talking to any strangers? Just me, the ice-cream guy, and Hank. [Gasps] Who's hank, Willa? Just our neighbor. John : Years ago, there was some sort of an indecent-exposure thing in a park. "Thing"?! Try conviction! The man is a s*x offender. [Knock on door] Hank Asher? Can I help you? Hi, I'm Officer Meyer. Do you know Adam Warren? Lives across the street. Is everything okay? Adam disappeared a couple hours ago. Were you at the rally in the park? Simple question... yes or no. Hank was home with me all night. Uh, we watch old movies together on Friday. Oh. Okay. Well, thanks for your time. Thanks. Which one? What? I love them, too. The classics. Which one was on? Goodnight, Officer. ♪ Okay, what we're looking at is our east quadrant. It's directly north of our red dragon. Thanks. Deep woods, thick brush. You see anything interesting... Sanchez : Hobbit, leprechaun? [Snickers] Got something to say, Detective? Anyone else? Hmm? I want hourly updates. Man : You heard the detective. Let's go. [Police radio chatter] What's going on? Some sicko had a lair in the woods. They think he had the mayor's kid in there. People are animals. ♪ So, you remember my car, huh? Do you still play football? You used to really good. What kind of sleeper are you, Hank? Side, back, tummy? I don't sleep. Insomniac. You know what's keeping you up at night? I have a pretty good idea. Bad mattress. Does it have a box spring? No. Is the padding foam? It's a prison mattress. [Chuckles] Bottom line, you're looking for comfort. Got great bang for your buck here. What else do you remember? About what? Anything. I mean, you remember what school you went to? Or what do you... what do you remember about Alex? I don't remember him. Her. ♪ She was your best friend. Memory foam, inner spring, retails for about $500, but with the special we got going, you could... What about that one? The Imperial. French lamb's wool sewn inside Texas cotton. It's a little pricier than the other options. How much? $10,000. [Sighs] I've been saving up. ♪ So, you want to try something on? I wore these. [Scoffs] Kind of old-school, huh? No. I wore ones just like these when he took me. ♪ My brother comes home after 10 years of torture, I'm calling in sick for at least a week. You're a douche. So you suspect, but don't want to confirm socially. Say with a drink? I don't drink, Ryan, or date. Men? People. Poll numbers? Well, thanks to the 24-hour news cycle, name recognition's off the charts, and the association is overwhelmingly positive. But? People are questioning if she can handle the business of being governor. You know, given everything you guys are going through. Book us one of those big sit-down interviews for the whole family. Let them see that we're healing. Are you? What? Healing. We will be. [Floorboard creaks] [Door opens, closes] ♪ Adam? Adam : Mom? ♪ [Door creaks] Hi. What are you doing in here? Sleeping. Why aren't you in your bed? I can't sleep in there. Adam. I need to touch the walls. ♪ [Sighs] He's sleeping on the closet floor because he would rather be in a cage than... He needs time. Well, how much? I don't know. A... a... and he's also concerned about how we're gonna treat the man that tortured him. It's all very normal. Given the circumstances. [Sighs] Your son was 8 years old when he was taken. I know. We have done the math. Thank you. So Adam spent more time with his kidnapper than he ever did at home. No. For all practical purposes, this guy was Adam's family. No! I know that this is hard to hear... I... I know. No. ...but you've got to wrap your head around... You are his doctor, all right? You are supposed to be fixing him. He's not a broken toilet, he's our son. No, no, he's not. He's not our son. He's just... ♪ Claire : He's... [Sighs] He is in there somewhere. Please, just help us find him. [Sighs] Chief. Why can't you just give me one more day? You know what, one has a nasty habit of turning into a lot more than one, so no, I can't. We just have 30 acres left. If you just give me like five guys, maybe even three, we can... Look, even the child's psych says that this red dragon is probably a... what's it... a-a mental construct. His imagination protecting him from trauma. I can't have my guys wandering around in the woods when I need them to re-interview all the vendors from the rally that night. We did that 10 years ago. Not to mention 75,000 people live in the city, and when they call 911, they want someone to answer. There's nothing there, Meyer. I'm calling it. But tell him we're doing everything we can. John : He's sleeping in his closet now so that he can touch the walls during the night 'cause a tiny, dark closet feels more like home to him than his  actual  home. Chief doesn't believe what we're looking for is in those woods. Do you? John... Come on, do you? 
 
 ♪ [Sighs] We're not stopping the search. We're just refocusing elsewhere. While he gets further and further away. I keep having this dream that I'm killing people. Innocent people. My fingers around their necks, pushing sharp things into their guts, making them bleed, one after the other. You want to kill him. It's... It's understandable. No, I want to kill everyone he loves. ♪ Much better than the silly kid stuff, right? You could put up some more posters, maybe get a flat screen. That could be cool. And we could get you a new bedspread. We can look for colors tomorrow. And if you feel like it, you can try on some of those new shirts. Okay. Okay. Uh, you want to brush your teeth? Yeah, sure. Oh, could you get the pillow from the guest room? I think it's a little softer than this one. And we'll go over the options for the interview. Mom... Get the pillow... now. ♪ This is Detective Meyer. Come in. Dispatcher : Go ahead, Detective. I need backup at the 18th mile of Franklin Woods Road. Uh, I think I found something. A... a door, a metal door. It's the... it's the Adam Warren investigation. Stand by. I've got officers on the way, Detective. [Explosion] 11-71! I need backup and the fire department! He's burning the evidence! He's burning it all down! The suspect is here and he's burning it down! I bought these for the Warrens. Uh, take the wrappers off and... and run them over. Mom... That poor family. I can't imagine what they're going through. I don't think that's a very good idea. Go and make things right. We both know you didn't hurt that boy. Hello. [Clears throat] These are some muffins. I'm very sorry for what you're going through. Exactly what was the nature of your relationship with my son? He was nice to me. He was a good boy. [Whimpers] Mrs. Warren? [Whispering] Is. Is. What? I'm sorry. [Normal voice] Is! Is! He  is  a good boy! ♪ [Indistinct conversations] [  Rock music playing ] Starting without me? [Chuckles] For real, you are like a stalker. You  made me into one. Whoa, I... I was going to call. Oh, what? You lost my number? No. Mm. No. I, um... I washed my jeans. Who writes stuff on a napkin? I... Bam! Oh. Oh, man. Okay. So, when you're not stalking dudes from high school... [Chuckling] Okay. ... what do you do? Oh. I was really hoping you wouldn't ask that. Are you a rocket scientist? [Laughs] All right, you ready for this jelly? Oh, yeah. I am ready for the jelly. [Laughs] Senior Executive Director of Photocopying at Kinkos. Mm-hmm. Mnh-mnh. I'm huge in neighborhood printing. Wow. That  is  intimidating. I'm leaning in. [Chuckling] You should. [Both laugh] So, do you want another round? I do, but... I won't 'cause I'm kind of trying not to be that sad alcoholic guy who still lives with his parents. Yeah. Yeah, you're super attracted to me right now, are you? You're killing it. [Chuckles] Well, on that note, I am gonna go take a... I'm gonna go use the restroom. Mm. And then I will chivalrously walk you home and kiss you goodnight. [Chuckles] You're killing it. Killing it. Oh. Careful. You get the... killing it. Woman : Here you go. Oh, we're not gonna need that. And can you bring us another round? Okay. Make his a double. [  Rock music playing ] [Rattling] Do you hear that? What is that? Claire, what did you do? [Sniffles, cries] Oh. [Sobs] That's o... It's okay, bud. All right. [Sighs] ♪ [Knock on door] Why did you confess? See what time it is? Why did you confess to a crime you didn't commit? [Sighs] You know why. I want to hear you say it. They had stuff on me. They threatened me. Oh, so  you're  the victim here? I am a victim. I'm innocent. No, you're  not  innocent. We stopped looking because you said you killed him. And that money they gave you... that doesn't make you a victim. It makes you a liar, it makes you a coward, and it makes you as sick as the b*st*rd who did it. I didn't lock the boy in a basement. No. You just made sure that he stayed there. ♪ [Police radio chatter] ♪ [Radio chatter continues] ♪ Nina :  What was the dragon doing, Adam? Adam :  The man lied on top of me. Where was the door? It was up on the ceiling. The red dragon... [Echoing] His skin looks like gravel. [Echoing] What was the dragon doing, Adam? Where was the door? It was up on the ceiling. ♪ Len : You all right down there, Meyer? ♪ What do you see? Chief, move to your left. ♪ John : [Echoing]  He's sleeping in his closet now so that he can touch the walls during the night ♪ Claire : Our son Adam was... last seen during candidates night at Mooreland Park. He was wearing gray pants and a white "Claire Warren for City Council" T-shirt. If you have any information... about where Adam is, or if you remember anything out of the ordinary from that night, please contact the Red Pines police. [Crying] Please, if you have our boy, please, please. He's only 8 years old, and he's never been away from home, not even for one night. And he gets scared of the dark. What did you do with my son? [Crowd murmuring] What did you do with my son? [Murmuring continues] What did you do? What did you do with my son? What did you do?! Tell me! What did you do with my son? What did you do with my son? John : Stop! Stop! Tell me where he is right now! You give him to me! Stop, stop! Tell me! Stop! Stop! You tell me where he is right now! Stop! Stop! Stop! You give me back my son! Stop! Stop! Stop! Give me my son! My son! [Crowd murmuring] [Sobs] ♪ How many cups is that? Two. Four. [Chuckles] So, I've been fielding initial offers for the sit-down. I think we go traditional. A woman, someone maternal who you can make cry... Diane, Meredith. We need to influence public perception with this. We'll obviously need the whole family. That might be a problem. Adam? Or Dad? You'll get him onboard, honey. You always say just the right thing. Print the bunker door and the ladder first. I don't believe he'd pour accelerant on his escape route. So, when we finally get this b*st*rd... and that's a when, not an if... any defense attorney worth half a damn's gonna tear you apart. What are you talking about? You worked this case as a uniformed officer 10 years ago, Detective Meyer, didn't you? In fact, didn't you actually put away someone else for this crime? What did you do, Len? So, given that you arrested a man who turned out to be innocent, why should this jury believe you have the right man now? What did you do? For the good of this case, I had to. Believe me, I didn't want to. [Camera shutter clicks] ♪ [Indistinct conversation] ♪ [Sighs] Why'd you quit football? What? Was it 'cause you broke your arm? No, I just stopped playing during college. Why? I liked other things better, I guess. Like what? Dude. I'm not the same person I was 10 years ago, okay? Neither am I. [Chuckles] Yeah, but you got a good excuse. So do you. ♪ [Indistinct conversations] [Telephone rings] You smell like a distillery. Thanks. What do you got? The older brother's got doubts. What does that mean? He's not totally sure Adam is... Adam. How the hell did you get that? [Rock music playing] [Moans] [Music continues] ♪ Come on, baby, now ♪

Mr. Warren. Hey! Hey. Yeah. Do you have an appointment, hon? No. Um, look, this is a little weird, but my little brother used to be a patient here when he was a little kid. Adam Warren. [Gasps] Oh, gosh. I've been praying for your family. Oh, cool. Cool, yeah. Thanks. Anyway, um, it's a little stupid, but we're putting together, like, a scrapbook for him, you know, 'cause he's been gone so long, and we thought it might be nice to have his... dental records to see. Oh, sure. [Chuckles] Just to compare. Contrast. [Keyboard clacking] Um... Ah. Your sister already picked them up. Oh. Great. [Chuckles] Thanks. Have a good day. ♪ So, what's the new book about? [Chuckles] Oh, hell if I know. I got my kid back. There goes my street cred with the grief groups. [Chuckles] Tragedy fangirls will be up in arms. [Laughs] Nice being home, huh? All of us together. We'll be together a lot more now with the campaign. Oh, no, honey. No. I only need you for a few things. No, I don't want a part in this. Photo ops and appearances. We don't need the scrutiny right now, okay? We don't need the press going through our trash. You worried about what they'll find? Don't be. [Chuckles] I've got you covered. What does that mean? [Chuckles] You know, the first time I saw the name Nina on your phone, I didn't even know who she was. I was 13. I only knew Officer Meyer. Then I started erasing your e-mails to her from your history because I knew you didn't know how to do that, and I also knew Mom would check. I deleted text messages, I made excuses why you were late to birthdays. You have no idea how close you came to being caught over and over again. How you almost fell off that cliff. Willa, I... But you didn't fall because of me, because I went above and beyond. I... I didn't know what... "inside you" meant at 13, but I knew it needed to be off your phone. [Chuckles] I did things no kid should have to do. I buried bodies for you, and I would do it again. Uh, but... but now... I need you to do something for me. Are you threatening me? I'm asking. I'm asking you not to make me do that. ♪
