 Previously on "The Family"... 
 I'm gonna solve your case. 
 You're going to tell the whole world that I caught your monster. 
 What's in the bag?

 Willa : ‭Nina knows he's not Adam. 
 I am not going to hope that my son's murderer isn't caught! 
 I know. I know. 
 He won't tell anyone the truth. 
 If he did, he'd have to admit that he had two kids down there and only one came out alive. 
 Did you hurt him? Did you hurt my brother?! 
 Yes. 
 ♪ 
 Bridey, I'm not gonna share a chick with my sister. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 Because this is a big deal to her. 
 If you're just using her for... whatever... it's got to stop. 
 I think I'm having the baby. 
 You have to help me. 
 Come on. You can do it. Push. 
 [Baby crying] 
 You're gonna up and get that key. 
 Jane : I don't know where he went, but he took the key with him. 
 I'm him. 
 ♪ 
 Nina : Some stories you know the ending to before they're even written. 
 They're set in stone. 
 Never to change. 
 Hurtling towards the inevitable. 
 It's been two hours. 
 I get you for 36 before I have to charge you. 
 Cream? 
 You know, ‭I came here to help you out. 
 You're wasting your time. I'm not the guy you're looking for. 
 So I'd like this to go as quick as possible. 
 You and me both, Doug. 
 Were you at the Kensington Mall the afternoon of October 20th? 
 Yes. 
 What were you doing? 
 Shopping with my girlfriend. 
 [Sighs] Yes. 
 I was at the Kensington Mall in a blue jacket, like probably a hundred other people, and if the jacket you found had dog hairs on it, that makes sense, too. 
 Yellow labs ‭are a pretty popular breed. 
 Haven't been through all this? 
 Yes, I was at the Kensington Mall. 
 Yes, ‭I did drive a pick-up truck. 
 I probably even drove it with my dog at my side and my blue jacket on. 
 None of this makes me a kidnapper. 
 At the most, it makes me a country song. 
 ♪ 
 [Door opens] 
 I have been here for 13 hours. 
 14. 
 I've barely slept. 
 I can't imagine what it's like to be trapped in such a confined space for so long. 
 Where's Agent Clements? 
 I don't know. 
 ‭What did you do with him? 
 I... 
 ‭Where is Agent Clements? 
 What did you do with him? 
 Let's talk about Jane. 
 What do you want to know? 
 Do you have to take a pill to nail her, or do you just picture a little boy? 
 Have you heard the theory that pedophiles are groomed? 
 Well, I'm sure you're gonna tell me. 
 Your mom and dad divorced when you were 9, right? 
 She probably had a lot of boyfriends coming in and out. 
 One takes an unusual interest in you. 
 I'm guessing it was... Mark? 
 He stuck around the longest. 
 Went to all your basketball games. 
 Took you to your first concert. 
 He filled in some soft, gooey piece you were missing... love, support, confidence... just enough to earn your trust. 
 So it was confusing when he crossed the line, and before you knew it, your sexual responses were conditioned to thinking keeping an 8-year-old boy in a windowless pit for 10 years was normal. 
 Ordinary, even. 
 You certainly mastered Google. 
 It's a pretty common story. 
 Oh, so is yours. 
 You convinced yourself you had the right guy last time, and you didn't. 
 So you can't not get him this time. 
 You've given up your whole life to be in this room for this one moment with me. 
 Is it everything you hoped for? 
 Well, we have an hour left, detective. 
 How you want to spend it? 
 ♪ 
 [Gasps] 
 What are you doing? 
 I was gonna ask you a question. 
 Uh... you could have knocked. 
 I didn't want to wake you. 
 Okay. 
 It's about confession. 
 What about it? 
 What do you do? 
 You confess your sins, and the priest gives you penance so you can atone, and then you're absolved. 
 Does it work? 
 Not for everything. 
 ♪ 
 I didn't mean to scare you. 
 ♪ 
 Woman : Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! 
 Adam! Adam! Adam! 
 Adam, how did it feel to cast your first vote? 
 Good. 
 Who'd you vote for? 
 I can't tell you that. 
 Oh, come on, now. 
 You really want four years of this? 
 I want eight. He's a natural. 
 He's a good actor. 
 He might be more like her than you.

 Hi. 
 [Chatter] 
 Thank you, everyone. 
 That's all we’ll have time for right now. 
 Claire : What is it? 
 ‭Nina. 
 Oh, for the love of God. 
 Okay, yeah. ‭It's election day. 
 Can't she just give us one minute? 
 So they got the guy in custody. 
 They want Adam to identify him. 
 [Chatter continues] 
 [Breathing heavily] Well, that one's not gonna work. 
 It will. 
 It won't. 
 You got a blow torch? 
 Just have to wait until he gets back. 
 That's not a good idea. 
 I'll try and talk some sense into him. 
 We both know how this is gonna end for me, and it's not in a hug. 
 I don't think he's a murderer. 
 You have no idea what he is. 
 The person you thought you knew stopped existing when he kept an 8-year-old child in a hole, and if you don't get that by now, you're a bigger idiot than I thought! 
 That came out wrong. 
 You're gonna get me out of here, Jane. 
 How? 
 You're gonna go back to the house and give the baby a bottle so he's nice and tired and ready to sleep through anything, and then you're gonna get a bucket of ice, some rubbing alcohol, tight rubber bands, a bunch of clean towels, and a lot more whiskey. 
 Why? 
 Because you're gonna cut off my thumbs. 
 ♪ 
 [Door closes] 
 Can they see me? 
 Nina : It's one-way glass. 
 Can you think of a word or phrase he would say to you? 
 Something familiar? 
 Bracelet. 
 Bracelet. Key. 
 What's that mean? 
 He called the shackle my bracelet, and then he made me toss him the key. 
 Woman : Number one, please step forward. 
 Repeat the words "bracelet, key". 
 Bracelet, key. 
 Number two, please step forward. 
 And the phrase. 
 Bracelet, key.

 Step back. 
 Number three. 
 Bracelet, key. 
 Step back.

 Why don't we take a break? 
 I don't need a break. Let's do the next one. 
 I think you should take another look. 
 That's not him. He's not in there. 
 Woman : Meyer, I'm calling it.
