 Previously on "The Family"... 
 Adam! 
 Adam! Adam? Oh, God, Adam. 
 What if it's not him? 
 There's just been something off about him. 
 You're a drunk, and you are confused. 
 Who's that? 
 A friend. 
 Reporter : Hank Asher, behind bars for more than 10 years, is back at home. 
 I need to use Adam as bait. 
 He's here. He sees him. 
 He's not okay. He's not okay. I know my son. 
 I don't feel right. I... 
 Doctor : The blockage was here, right below his appendix. 
 My son had his appendix out when he was 5. 
 Adam? 
 Adam? 
 Ben? 
 Who is he? 
 Is his name Ben? 
 [Voice breaking] I'm so sorry, mom. 
 What did you do? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Mom. 
 Mom? 
 Don't you have any idea what you have done? 
 Do you even understand... 
 We were falling apart, all of us! 
 Do you understand? 
 Do you understand what you've done? 
 I don't know. How could you possibly think... 
 I thought I could make it better. 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. 
 I thought if I could just... if I could just bring him back... 
 God... 
 And I did. 
 And I did... I brought my brother back! 
 No, it's not him! It is not your brother! 
 I thought I could fix it! 
 Seeing you lose him was the worst moment of my life. 
 Oh, well, now you get to see it all over again. 
 Mom, wha... Mom... 
 Mom, please. 
 You shouldn't drive. You're too upset. 
 What if someone sees you like this?! 
 Oh, my God. 
 That's why you did it. 
 What? 
 To win the election. 
 That's not true. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That's not true. 
 What? 
 That's not true. 
 You were worried about name recognition. 
 And now you're not! 
 No, I just wanted... I wanted things to go back to the way they were. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I just... 
 I never thought about the race. 
 I don't believe that. I don't believe it! 
 I love you, mom. 
 I don't believe that, either! 
 Mom... 
 He was with him! 
 For 10 years, he was there! 
 Do you think that matters? 
 He helped him. He knew him! He... he... he... 
 Everything about him, more than we ever did! 
 But he's not my son! 
 He made Adam's life bearable! 
 Doesn't he deserve something for that? 
 He is not my son! 
 Your son is dead! 
 And... 
 And Ben is here. 
 And he may not be Adam, but he's the closest thing we have.

 [Whimpers] 
 [Rustling] 
 Ben : French toast with bacon or scrambled eggs with hash browns? 
 I'm really good at cooking. 
 I'll probably be a chef someday. 
 I had a mouse down here. 
 Her name was Lola. 
 What's your favorite book? 
 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 
 What's your name? 
 You got to eat. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, more for me. 
 I hate eggs. 
 French toast it is. 
 You burnt the bacon. 
 What happens down here? 
 We eat. 
 We play. 
 We have school. 
 Sometimes our Friend comes. 
 What does he do? 
 He brings toys.

It's old bread. If we're good, maybe our Friend will bring ice cream. Stop calling him that. [Scoffs] What? He's not our friend. You know what he comes here to do, and it's not bring ice cream.

The two of you were supposed to be watching him! Danny : He was fine. He was with Willa, and... John : But you're the oldest! You're in charge!

Oh, thank God. Oh, my God. Thank God. Don't you run off like that ever again. Where was he? At an arcade downtown. He had gotten real into NBA Jam. Oh, my God. Thank you, thank you. You folks have a good night. My family has had some very trying times. But we love each other, and we are strong, and every family in Maine deserves a strong foundation!

You should go to the police tonight, before your hand heals. We got to get back to work. Why are you doing this? Because Adam was wrong. It wasn't his fault. But now I can fix... everything. [Sighs] John : Hey, where've you been? At a... cheap motel with a dirty stranger. [Chuckles] You're leaving again? They, uh... yeah, they booked some readings in San Francisco. Do you want to come? Or, here's a crazy idea... you, uh, stay home. Your mom and I... You're getting a divorce. That's... that's a mistake. No, honey... Y-you should stick it out a few more days. No, it won't matter. It will. It... trust me. It will. No, it's been over for a long time. It was just Adam. If that hadn't happened, you wo... No, we'd have broken anyway. What? Mom and I are different people. All Adam did was show us how true that was. Did you know that your little brother hardly ever cried? I mean, he did, of course, but... He... the kid was a little ray of sunshine. So? So he'd hate what we're doing to ourselves now. [Sighs] We're wallowing. It's time to move on.

It's full of hills and valleys. Confront your grief, y-your fear of it. Excuse me, folks. Can I help you? Oh, my God. They found that boy. What boy? The one that was murdered years ago, the Mayor's kid. Reporter :  Though a body was never found, after an extensive investigation, the Warren's neighbor was eventually convicted for Adam's murder. But sources say the young man showed up earlier today to a downtown police precinct and clearly identified himself as the youngest Warren child. How is this happening? I don't know. Oh, my God. I don't understand. Me neither. He confessed! Hank Asher said that he just... I-I know. Just... It's not real. It can't be real. Mom? What if it is? He's got scars, signs of abuse. He was kept in shackles. How do we know it's him? It's been 10 years. He was supposed to be dead. We ran a DNA test. It's him. Claire : Is he okay? Hi, Adam. Ben : Hi, mom. Welcome home, Ad. Nina : Just so you know, it's kind of a mob scene back at the house with the press. Might be a little overwhelming. Can you just have them arrested? It's private property.
