 Honey, no.

 Except when he's getting to third base with some slut. 
 Like you'd ever know what that is, you freak of nature! 
 Stop it. 
 Turning on each other won't help anyone... 
 Definitely not Adam.

 Man : Mayor Warren! 
 Have you spoken to the police about the reappearance of Adam?

 The mayor's kid. 
 Reporter :  Though a body was never found, after an extensive investigation, the warrens' neighbor was eventually convicted for Adam's murder. 
 But sources say the young man showed up earlier today to a downtown police precinct and clearly identified himself as the youngest Warren child. 
 He was promptly taken to City Memorial for evaluation, and I am told though his physical condition is weak and he has sustained several injuries of unknown nature, he is now stable. [Panting] Where is he? Where is Adam? I don't know. She wants us to talk to the doctors first. Oh, well, screw her. I want to see my son. Bourbon? Shut up. Is Dad here? Yeah, he's getting a flight. Where is she?! Right here. I want to know how something like this gets leaked. He walked into a busy precinct, Will. How? How? Where did he come from? He said that he traveled for at least 20 miles. I've got teams in every woods within 50 searching for the b*st*rd that took him. Does he know who he is? Yes. How do we know it's him? It... It's been 10 years. He was supposed to be dead. We ran a DNA test. It's him. And is he okay? I mean, what do the doctors say? He's got some scars. Signs of abuse. He was kept in shackles. He took half the skin off his hand in the escape. [Sobs] Oh, god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. All right. Take a moment, and then shut it down. Oh. "Shut it down"? The only thing that's important is when you walk in that door, he feels safe.

Right, Mother? ♪♪ Years ago, there was some sort of an... indecent-exposure thing in a park. "Thing"?! Try conviction! The man is a s*x offender. Man : The conviction of my client 10 years ago was based purely on circumstantial evidence. Mr. Asher was bullied into taking a plea deal by the police department. Our city's finest. So in light of the DNA test confirming the identity of Adam Warren, I suspect we can all safely assume that he wasn't murdered by my client. I am asking for his immediate and unconditional release. Well, I'm going to agree with you, unless the state has any objections. Woman : No, Your Honor. I can go home. Man : You can go home. Mr. Asher, the court would like to apologize. Judge : A decade ago, justice was profoundly absent from this case. And therefore, I'd like to grant you maximum compensation for wrongful incarceration. It will be $30,000 a year for each year that you served. And with that, the matter can be adjourned.

[Sighs] If we're gonna have a shot at catching the guy who did this, I need to question Adam. It can wait till morning. The boy just got home. He knows that Adam's escaped. He could be on the move. Every second counts. I waited 10 years to get my son back. You can wait one night. He could have other boys, Claire. He could be doing this to other families. I want the shrink here for this. [Sniffles] You two seem good. I'm glad you're here. I came for Adam. [Door opens] [Door closes] Fred : Well, here you go, Hank. Your aunt Sally and I are real happy all that ugly business got straightened out. Where's my mom? Oh, boy. The people there at the facility... They were supposed to tell you.

Nina : Tell me about the man in the woods. What does he look like? His skin looks like... Gravel. H-he has holes in his face. What about the place he kept you in? Nina : Any windows?

He always came to me. ♪♪ Back to our continuing coverage now of the extraordinary Adam Warren story. Tonight, Hank Asher... behind bars here for more than 10 years for the boy's murder... Is back at home after DNA evidence yesterday confirmed the boy's return. An emergency hearing was held this morning, which declared Asher a free man. His lawyer tells us tonight Mr. Asher has no plans to sue the Red Pines Police Department despite being wrongly held for so many years, which his lawyer calls extremely generous. Adam : Sometimes he would forget to close the door behind him, and I could see outside through a window upstairs. What could you see? Can I have some more? Sure, sweetie. In one... one second. Just... What could you see? A red dragon. ♪♪ Okay. Tell me... Tell me about that. The red... red dragon. I watched it while the man lied on top of me. It was glowing. Okay. It was beautiful. All right, you can stop this now. And what was the dragon doing, Adam? He has been through enough tonight, Detective. We can continue this tomorrow. What was the dragon doing, Adam? The man lied on top of me. I said stop this now! Every night, he would come... What was the dragon doing, Adam? Nina, come on! He was breathing fire. Right at me. ♪♪ Right at me. I'm gonna get him, okay? ♪♪ I'm gonna get him. ♪♪ Claire : And why is this all on me? You're their father! Danny's drunk! Willa's becoming a religious nutjob. Where the hell have you been? John : It's not the right time for a campaign. Not the right time, not the right time. When is the right time? When he comes back?! Don't say... no, no. Don't... don't... don't say it! He's not coming back!! [Nina clears throat] Sorry. I just heard you from back there. I... The judge denied the search warrant again. Oh, great. Said that there's still not enough evidence that Hank Asher had anything to do with Adam's disappearance. But... Willa saw them together. You can't get a search warrant unless you have evidence, and you can't get evidence until you have a search warrant. Welcome to the justice system. ♪♪ The low, low price of 10 cents a day, you, too, could feed a starving child. Couldn't make it till noon today, champ? What are you doing? [Chuckles] Ow! Don't worry. They're still there. They're like roaches. While it's lovely to have you back home again, could you refrain from taunting the media? I still have a job to get back to. Speaking of which... I don't think we can stall much longer. People want to see you handling this as a mother. We should book something... An interview. This isn't a political opportunity, Will. It's our life. Or at least make a statement, ideally before the announcement. What announcement? We talked about this. John. Yeah, well, I guess I figured with everything going on right now, the... the governor thing would be off the table. Well, let's not make any decisions about anything just now. We just got our son back. Can I have some more? Of course, baby. You used to hate those. The smell of them made you sick. What? Eggs. 
 
 [Telephones ringing] Gus : I want bodies outside the mayor's house, where she gets her coffee in the morning, her dry cleaners. Bridey : Gus! Find out what bathroom she likes to poop in...

I'm sorry for what happened to you. You're sorry for what happened to me? Yes, I am. You happened to me. Your family happened to me. Did you want me to forgive you? This city was a mob. They were after me. They were gonna get this monster no matter what, and you people lit the torches. No. Now, wait a minute... You know what I thought about, John? When I laid my cell, I thought about your boy... Your beautiful little boy. I wished I did it. I wished I took him from you and hurt him, wrapped my fingers around his throat and watch the life drip from his little body, bit by bit. So don't feel sorry about what happened to me. I didn't spend a minute feeling sorry for what happened to you. ♪♪ Price of coffee's not what it used to be. ♪♪ Danny : Why didn't you run? I mean, for 10 years, some crazy dude had you locked up in a basement. He had to bring you food every day, right? I mean, he must have messed up and forgot to lock the door once or twice. Why...

How does it get in there? What? The ship. How does it get in there? Danny : What if it's not him? I know. I know that sounds crazy, and maybe it is. But he is... different, okay? From the moment I saw him at the hospital, there's just been something off about him. H-he's different. Are you drunk? No, no. Just listen to me, because... Adam's different because he's not 9 years old anymore, because he eats eggs. Uh, the... the ships! In the bottles? He doesn't remember that you have to collapse the mast. That's all he did! It was all he cared about. How could he forget that? Maybe it was the decade of rape and torture. [Scoffs] Willa... They did a DNA test, you worthless piece of... That's enough! You are my son... And I will always love you. But you... are a drunk, honey. And it's my fault for cleaning up after you. But... you are just a drunk. Mom... Yeah, you're a drunk, and you are confused.
