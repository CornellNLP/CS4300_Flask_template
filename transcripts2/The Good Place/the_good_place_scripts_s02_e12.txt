 So, Michael, you're saying there's      a new angle I should consider in this case? 
 Love that. 
 Major drama. 
 [CHUCKLING] 
 Spill the tea, sweetheart. 
 The premise of our system      is that a person's score during her time on Earth      is final and inarguable,      but because of my accidental experiment,      these four humans got better       after they died. 
 That's not supposed to be possible. 
 Over and over again, I watched as they became       thoughtful and generous and caring. 
 And think about where they started. 
 Uh, Jason, growing up in Jacksonville,       what did you do for fun after school every day? 
 Me and my friends whipped empty spray paint cans       at flamingos. 
 And now he's so much better. 
 I was already pretty good. 
 When I was six,       I hit one right on the button. 
 Okay, let the immortal beings talk, darling. 
 So they got better in your little pretend world. 
 That doesn't prove anything       about what they were like on Earth. 
 No, see, I think it does prove something. 
 If I'm right, the system by which we judge humans... 
 the very method we use to deem them good or bad... 
 is so fundamentally flawed and unreasonable       that hundreds of millions of people       have been wrongly condemned       to an eternity of torture. 
 Damn! 
 That was intense! 
 Look at my arm, y'all. 
 Look, I got goosebumps. 
 Huh, yeah. 
 Doesn't happen very often. 
   ♪ 
 Wow, so you saw your parents in the test? 
 Yes. 
 And I immediately fell right back into my old pattern,       desperately trying to impress them       and earn their admiration. 
 Then I heard this little voice in my head       saying, "Tahani, don't do this."       The little voice in your head sounds like the old lady       from "Downton Abbey."       Oh, yeah, sorry. 
 Maggie Smith is my godmother. 
 Anyway, I took a deep breath,       told them I ate a Cheeto,       and walked away. 
 Man. 
 You have made so much progress. 
 I'm proud of you, hot stuff. 
 Whatever progress I have made,       it's because you and I have become mates. 
 That's British for "friends."       No, I know. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - Man. 
 Think about everything that's happened to us. 
 We died, Michael tortured us,       we teamed up with him, we escaped,       we went through the Portal, The Judge ruled against us,       then Michael showed up. 
 This has been one of the craziest years of my life. 
 One of? 
 Yeah, I'm not sure what I would do       if one more insane thing happened. 
 Hi, Jason. 
 I love you. 
 Oh, word? 
 Word. 
 I've been avoiding telling you. 
 My excuse was that I needed time to evaluate       my complex feelings, but that was just a rationalization. 
 This might be the last time I ever get to talk to you,       so there it is... 
 I love you. 
 And I hereby stop avoiding this topic       and rationalizing by saying the situation is complicated. 
 Or that my brain is grinding       like a fork in a garbage disposal. 
 All right. 
 Whatever. 
 You're not really a part of this, Chidi. 
 Hey, guess what. 
 I think I love you too, girl. 
 I'm not a girl. 
 I'm also not just a Janet anymore. 
 I don't know what I am. 
 [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
 Hey, man. 
 What's up? 
 ♪ 
 Hot diggity dog. 
 Oh, no! 
 Now the thing I said right after we kissed       will always be "hot diggity dog."       - [LAUGHS] 
 - Whatever. 
 It was an honest reaction. 
 I stand by it. 
 Hi, guys. 
 Couple quick announcements. 
 Would anyone eat chips and guac if I put it out? 
 It's good. 
 It's homemade. 
 No takers? 
 A'ight. 
 Second thing:        we figured out a plan to save your souls. 
 For the time being, The Judge is gonna put you        in your own medium places,        like Mindi St. 
 Clair. 
 And while you're there, I'll keep working        every angle I can think of        to get you guys into the Good Place, for real. 
 This is great. 
 So we'd all be together? 
 Oh, no, that's the thing about Medium Places... 
 it has to be tailored to what's medium for the individuals. 
 So if you're all together, it ain't medium. 
 How much time will we be alone? 
 Hard to say. 
 Uh, could be a month. 
 Could be a million years. 
 So, between a month and a million years. 
 - Yeah, give or take. 
 - Yeah? 
 Somewhere in there. 
 Come on, you guys, I know this isn't perfect,        but I need more time to build my case,        and it's either this or back to the Bad Place. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll say it. 
 Both those options suck. 
 Okay, I'm sorry if that's blunt, Your Honor,        but it's true. 
 Also, Chidi just laid one on me, so I'm kinda dizzy. 
 You two kissed? 
 Hot diggity dog! 
 That's what I said! 
 The point is, we've all gotten better. 
 Why should we have to go live alone in a boring void        because of a messed-up system? 
 - How is that justice? 
 - Okay. 
 Slow your roll there, Erin Brockovich. 
 First of all,        y'all didn't get good enough to pass the tests        I just gave you. 
 Second, I still believe that the only reason        that you improved in Michael's fake neighborhood        is because you thought there was a reward        at the end of the rainbow. 
 You're supposed to good things        because you're good! 
 Not because you're seeking moral desert. 
 And I still believe        that they would've become good people        if they'd just gotten a... 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
 A push... 
 in the right direction. 
 Oh, no. 
 Nope, nope. 
 Absolutely not. 
 - It's a little crazy... 
 - A little bit crazy? 
 It's Looney Tunes. 
 - What are they talking about? 
 - No idea. 
 It sets a very dangerous precedent. 
 It's only four people. 
 And it's clearly the best way to see if bad people        can become good without knowing anything about        what's waiting for them in the afterlife. 
 Shotgun. 
 Whatever they're talking about,        if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun. 
 It's never gonna work, man. 
 If it doesn't, then they go        right back to the Bad Place. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - No one gets hurt. 
 Except them, forever. 
 And me, I assume, also. 
 Forever. 
 Mmm, mmm, mmm... 
 - okay, let's do it. 
 - Yes! 
 Ha! 
 I don't know why. 
 I'm just feeling kinda funky. 
 But there have to be strict rules. 
 Otherwise, the results will be tainted,        and I reserve the right to change my mind        - at any point. 
 - About what?! 
 Would someone who's not an eternal being        please explain to me what the f...

 [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] 
 God, Eleanor, take longer next time. 
 Oh, you look like crap. 
 I was outside the supermarket arguing with        that little environmental twerp... 
 - Ugh, I hate that guy. 
 - Really? 
 That skinny little hippy body kinda turns me on. 
 - Gross. 
 - Guys, listen. 
 I dropped the margarita mix, and when I went to pick it up,        a bunch of shopping carts came right at me,        and I was just frozen. 
 And then someone pushed me out of the way,        and the carts got, like, demolished        by a truck. 
 I mean, I could've died. 
 - Oh, my God. 
 - Wow. 
 That's crazy. 
 So is the margarita mix, like, gone? 
 I had a near death experience recently. 
 You know that old warehouse that burned down last month        and, like, four people died? 
 That building is, like, right by my old dentist. 
 If I still went to that dentist        and I had an appointment that day,        I would've been like... 
 right near there.

 And then I stopped. 
 And now I'm here. 
 Sounds like you had a pretty crazy year.

 - It's unclear. 
 You know the thing is, the problem really,        with being a do-gooder? 
 - What's that? 
 - No one cares. 
 I mean, some people care a little bit. 
 The twerpy little twerps from the environmental place,        they care, but I was a good person        for six months. 
 That's like five years, and it felt okay,        but not as good as I thought it would. 
 And what did I get for it? 
 Ah, see, now you're talking about moral desert. 
 Exactly. 
 Wait, I am? 
 What? 
 Moral desert is the concept        that if you act with virtue,        you deserve a reward. 
 Right. 
 If I'm not gonna get rewarded somehow,        like a tiara or one of those diagonal award belts... 
 - Sash. 
 - Sure. 
 Then why should I do good things? 
 You know, I had a friend that said        whenever she was doing something bad,        she'd hear this... 
 this little voice in her head,        distant little voice, saying, "Oh, come on now. 
 You know this is wrong."        And then when she started doing good things,        that voice went away. 
 It was a relief. 
 Your friend sounds like she's        one pick short of a... 
 pickle party. 
 [SNORTS] 
 She's a little rough around the edges,        but she was also a really good person,        when she tried. 
 See, I think that little voice        was her conscience,        trying to guide her in the right direction. 
 I gotta go home.
