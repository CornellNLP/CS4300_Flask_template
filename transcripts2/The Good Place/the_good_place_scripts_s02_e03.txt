 We're on the same page.   
 I wanna team up with you guys.   
 What? Why? You do? What?   
 I'm in a bit of a bind and I could use some backup.   
 So, what do you say? New best friends?   
 You wanna team up? 
You've been torturing us   
 - and lying about it. 
- Let's not get   
 all caught up on who lied to who   
 or which one of us created an entire fake reality    
 in order to cause eternal misery for the others.    
 That's ancient history.    
 It was happening until    seconds ago.    
 The point is that...    
 circumstances have changed.    
 And now, all of us teaming up is our best option.    
 I love being on teams. 
Oh, we need a team name.    
 Um... the Bobcats.    
 - Great. 
- Slow down, ding dong.    
 He wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.    
 He needs us.    
 - Why? 
- Because, as you said,    
 you keep beating me.    
 Look, I built this neighborhood    
 as a way to torture the four of you... psychologically...    
 for thousands of years.    
 And you keep figuring it out    
 and taking all the fun out of it.    
 - Fun? 
- Today, there was    
 a new development that really chapped my nips.    
 One of my employees is blackmailing me.    
 Vicky. She runs the clam chowder place    
 in the main square.    
 - A Little Bit Chowder Now. 
- Oh, the place    
 with the... the chowder fountain.    
 No, that's Pump Up the Clam.    
 A Little Bit Chowder Now has the lazy river of chowder.    
 Ugh! How did we ever think this was the Good Place?    
 Vicky thinks that she can run this neighborhood    
 better than I can.    
 And she wants to start her version in    minutes.    
 I am supposed to reboot you,    
 erase your memory and turn control over to her.    
 How are we supposed to team up with you    
 if you wipe our memories again?    
 Easy. I'm not going to.    
 You're going to act like you've been rebooted    
 and pretend that Vicky and the others are torturing you.    
 But then, on your own time, in private,    
 you can study ethics, ogle mailmen,    
 - do whatever you want. 
- Can I play iPad?    
 - Sure you can, buddy. 
- Yes.    
 Guys, there's no debate here.    
 My boss gave me two chances to make this work.    
 Suffice to say,    
 I tried more than two times.    
 If he finds out, we're all in hot water.    
 Literally. They will boil us.    
 We will be the main ingredient in a chowder of pain.    
 Human meeting. Bedroom. Now.    
 Oh, yeah, um, that whole no stair thing,    
 that was part of the torture.    
 - Let me help you.

 Son of a bench.    
 ♪ ♪   
 - Anyone have any ideas? 
- You know, believe it or not,    
 I actually found myself in a very similar situation    
 a few years ago, except in that instance,    
 Michael was Javier Bardem    
 and the Bad Place was Vanessa Redgrave's panic room.    
 Okay, stop talking. Do not talk again for     hours.    
 - What do we do? 
- We team up with Michael.    
 Okay, hot take, but I like your confidence.    
 - Tell me why. 
- He has a bow tie.    
 Oh, no.    
 I always trust dudes in bow ties.    
 Once, this guy in a bow tie came up to me    
 at the gun range in a Jacksonville bus station    
 and said he'd give me $       
 if I put these weird turtles in my duffle bag    
 and brought them to Daytona Beach.    
 So I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona    
 and the guy paid me the $   .    
 My point is, you always trust dudes in bow ties.    
 [grunts]    
 Ahh!    
 Look, Michael's a liar.    
 I know liars.    
 It was my job to trick people    
 into buying fake medicine    
 and I was the top salesperson    
 - seven years in a row. 
- I thought you only    
 - worked there five years. 
- Proves my point!    
 This is a trick.    
 - There's no way we trust him. 
- I agree.    
 He could be lying about this whole thing.    
 For all we know, you three are in    
 the Bad Place and I'm up in the Good Place,     
 where I belong, being tested.     
 - How would that even... 
- I don't know,     
 - but it's possible. 
- Before we do anything,     
 we need more information.     
 We should ask him every question we can think of.     
 - Yes. 
- Yes, we shall grill him     
 like the flank of a Niberian piglet.     
 I'm sorry, has it been     hours?     
 [bell dings]     
 Okay, man. We got questions.     
 First off, how can we possibly trust you?     
 You can't. But you have to.     
 Logically, you shouldn't but you have no choice.     
 I mean, I wouldn't, if I were you.     
 It's a crazy thing to do.     
 - But you gotta. 
- What happens if we don't?     
 Most likely, I reboot you once more,     
 you figure it out again, Vicky tells my boss,     
 he shuts everything down.     
 I get punished,     
 you end up spending the rest of eternity     
 in the real Bad Place,     
 up to your necks in a volcano full of scorpions.     
 I'll tell you what I want to know right now     
 before we go any further.     
 Did the Jacksonville Jaguars     
 win the Super Bowl last year?     
 [chuckles]     
 Oh, you're serious. Uh, no.     
 Will they ever win the Super Bowl?     
 Jason, I can't predict the future.     
 But no. [laughs] They won't.     
 Okay, well I just have, like,    more Jaguar questions...     
 No, you don't. Hey, Janet?     
 - Hi, there. 
- Do you have something shiny     
 Jason can play with?     
 [gasps]     
 How many different versions of this place     
 have we been through?     
 Uh, let's see.    .     
 The longest one was    months.     
 Uh, this current one has only been going for one week.     
 Boy, you guys barely know each other.     
 It's gonna make this tough.     
 What's that super tiny line?     
 That's the shortest one, eight seconds.     
 It was a butt reboot. I sat on the activator by mistake.     
 Michael, was I also rebooted     times?     
 Yes. Why?     
 Every time a Janet is rebooted,     
 she increases her social awareness and abilities.     
 I might be the most advanced Janet in the universe.     
 So Janet isn't with you.     
 No. There has to be a Janet in every neighborhood,     
 good and bad.     
 This one is an actual Good Place Janet     
 that I stole to help sell the ruse.     
 I guess it didn't work, though.     
 Because you keep failing.     
 - Yes, thank you. 
- You're welcome.     
 If you're not human, why do you look like us?     
 Everyone in the Bad Place Bureau of Human Affairs     
 gets randomly assigned a human body     
 so we can get the feel of how best to torture you.     
 I gotta say, it took me a long time to get used to     
 - the hanging bits. 
- Gross.     
 Oh, get your mind out of the gutter, Eleanor.     
 I was talking about my testicles.     
 Mindy St. Clair's is fake, I bet.     
 No, the Medium Place is real.     
 So annoying how you managed to slip away from me     
 - all those times. 
- Why even tell us     
 about any real thing?     
 Why not just lie about all of it?     
 Lies are always more convincing     
 when they're closer to the truth.     
 That's true. I crashed a lot     
 of open bar weddings as Eileen Shelbourne.     
 Even dated a groomsman for a few months.     
 So I had to keep the name, and he got Eileen     
 - tattooed on his neck. 
- Seriously?!     
 How are she and I in the same place?     
 - Oh, get over yourself. 
- Trust me, don't trust me,     
 it doesn't matter.     
 We're running out of time,     
 and I'm your only option.     
 We're running out of time     
 and I'm your only option?     
 A lot of guys your age said that to me     
 just as the bar was about to close.     
 But I never settled for them.     
 Because my ex-boyfriend lived nearby,     
 he was obsessed with me and he never slept     
 because he was addicted to Adderall.     
 There is always another option.     
 You guys do whatever you want.     
 - I'm out. 
- No!     
 My plan only works if all four of you     
 - are on board. 
- Then you better get cracking     
 on a new plan, pally, because so far,     
 I haven't heard a single good reason     
 why I should help you.     
 All right, how about this? You help me     
 trick Vicky and all those other goons,     
 I can get you to the real Good Place.     
 ♪ ♪   
 There's a way to get to the real Good place.     
 It's complicated.     
 It may take a while to arrange...     
 especially since I'll have to do it in secret...     
 but yes, yes, there is a potential     
 method of transportation.     
 Wait, is it nice?     
 Is there a business class?     
 Can I pre-board?     
 Yeah, let's not worry about that right now.     
 I can get us there.     
 Us?     
 You, Mr. Diabolical Torture Guy     
 are gonna try to join us in the Good Place?     
 Yeah, if I stay in the Bad Place, I'm doomed.     
 But if I rescue four pitiful, foul-smelling humans     
 from eternal damnation...     
 hit 'em with the big puppy dog eyes.     
 Please, sir, take pity on me, I've changed...     
 and all that crap,     
 maybe I can earn a spot, too.     
 We didn't deserve the Good Place     
 based on our time on Earth.     
 Will they even let us stay?     
 I gotta be honest, I have no idea.     
 But at least if you help me fool Vicky,     
 your brains don't get erased every two weeks.

 Okay, all humans who have not already been     
 suckered by Michael, another team meeting.     
 This is definitely a trap.   
 We figured out his game every time     
 and now he's just trying a new way to mess with us.     
 Teaming up with a demon is insane.     
 Maybe.     
 But I think we have to do it.

 Okay, look, I spent my whole life trying     
 to learn about right and wrong     
 and apparently, I failed.     
 I want us to get better and I want us to stay that way.

 I understand nothing.     
 Hey! Same here!     
 Michael, there's been a mistake.     
 I belong in the Good Place.     
 The real one with the good people.     
 Who do I speak to about correcting this?     
 Me and you're wrong.     
 Very well. I would like to speak to your manager.     
 Listen, sweetheart,     
 you've only been in this timeline for about a week.     
 So I think I'm gonna fast forward things a bit.     
 There's a very good reason why you ended up here.     
 You never cared about the people you were helping.     
 You did it only for fame or status or to spite your family.     
 That is utter tosh!     
 I had my flaws, just like anyone else,     
 but I raised billions for charity.     
 I was a good person and I defy you     
 or anyone else to prove otherwise.     
 You know, in all the reboots,     
 I never showed you how you died.     
 I was saving it in case I ever needed     
 to really make you miserable.     
 But it's hilarious.     
 Of course, I mean sad.     
 But it might help you come to grips

 I have long dreamt of being one of the women

 Let's begin with your sister, Kamilah.     
 A woman who... as you know... was offered the spot

 Don't you find that remarkable?     
 Kamilah is very impressive.

 only six months ago and yet, the critics

 Sadly, I will not be attending the ceremony

 harmonic balance.     
 - Well done. 
- I've only given     
 this opening day tour to you like,     times.     
 Hey, how's this for my oh-my-God-I'm-in-Heaven face?     
 - Not bad. 
- Right?     
 I'm a pretty good liar.     
 Now I wanna introduce someone that you're gonna     
 get to know very well.     
 She was the top point getter, so she'll be     
 helping me out around the neighborhood,     
 kind of like your mayor.     
 Vicky Sengupta!     
 [applause]     
 Vicky, would you like to say a few words?     
 Actually, Michael, I'd like to sing a few words.     
 Janet, hit it.     
 [Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive"]     
 ♪ At first I was afraid, I was petrified ♪     
 ♪ Kept thinking I could never live ♪     
 ♪ Without you by my side ♪     
 We should have a few hours to ourselves.     
 Vicky's working on her performance     
 for the welcome party tonight.     
 It looks like pretending to enjoy her singing     
 is gonna be half our job here.     
 I got her to tell me how she was gonna torture you     
 at the party, which is basically     
 the same way I did.     
 Eleanor gets drunk,     
 hogs all the shrimp,     
 insults people, etcetera.     
 Whatever bad stuff you do     
 becomes the basis for the chaos tomorrow morning.     
 Okay, okay. So my job is to get drunk     
 and insult people.     
 I think I can hack that.     
 Now, Chidi, I'm gonna need you     
 to act nervous and embarrassed by Eleanor.     
 - Way ahead of you. 
- Tahani, just be     
 your fabulous self.     
 And Jason, you're good old silent Jianyu the monk.     
 So I told Vicky that I would handle the surveillance     
 on the four of you.     
 That'll let us meet each day     
 for Chidi's ethics lessons,     
 which will apparently include me.     
 Even though that's transparently insane.     
 Cool. And, um, Janet, you're not gonna     
 - rat us out, right? 
- Well, Jason,     
 I've been thinking about this a lot     
 over the last  .  milliseconds,     
 I'm not allowed to lie, but my purpose     
 is to make humans happy.     
 And since you're the only actual humans here,     
 I'm on board for whatever fun little schemes     
 you guys come up with.     
 Okay, bring it in. Team huddle.     
 The Bad Place is about to be outsmarted     
 by a cowardly traitor, four dum-dums,     
 - and a robot. 
- Not a robot.     
 We can do this.     
 Team Cockroach on three.     
 One, two, three.     
 - All: Team Cockroach! 
- Bobcats!     
 I still think that's better.
