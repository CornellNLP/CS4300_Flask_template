 Steve :  Previously on  Hawaii Five-0... 
 Looks like your Five-O task force is making an impact. 
 (explosion) 
 Laura! 
 Laura did not want anybody to know that she was sending me evidence from my father's toolbox. 
 How do I tell Stan that I'm leaving, and that I'm pregnant with your child? 
 That's the woman I saw. 
 That's her. Number five. 
 I think the governor's hiding something. 
 Danny :  Tell me you didn't break into the governor's house. 
 I know what you did! 
 I have everything under control. 
 Chin :  Steve McGarrett, you are under arrest. 
 Danny :  Let him go. 
 Chin :  I can't let him go. 
 Yes, you can. We have jurisdiction. We are Five-O. 
 You don't understand. 
 There is no Five-O anymore. 
 (children singing singing in Hawaiian) 
 (singing in Hawaiian) 
 (song ends) 
 Guard : McGarrett. 
 You have a visitor. 
 (door buzzes open) 
 Why are you smiling at me? 
 You're not wearing a tie, it suits you. 
 No, I'm not wearing a tie. 
 'Cause there's no dress code for an out-of-work cop. 
 You get any leads on Wo Fat? 
 Uh, no. Nothing yet. 
 How's your family? 
 How's Rachel? 
 She getting morning sickness yet? 
 Yeah, she's, uh... 
 She's excellent. 
 Listen, I know you don't like visitors, but this guy wouldn't take no for an answer, so... 
 Let me guess, the governor had it coming? 
 You, uh, you didn't have to come down here, sir. 
 You okay, son? 
 I'm fine. 
 Nothing Hell Week didn't train me for. 
 Your man tells me the lieutenant governor's trying to move up your trial. 
 I heard. The new guy, he wants to show the public he's a zero tolerance type, so convicting me of Governor Jameson's murder is his first order of business. 
 Well, we are here to make sure that doesn't happen. 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Is there something I can help you with? 
 We know it was you. 
 It's just a matter of time before you're trading places with McGarrett. 
 Congratulations on the promotion, Lieutenant Kelly. 
 Smart move, rejoining HPD. 
 (door buzzes) 
 You got one hour. 
 (door buzzes) 
 Victor :  My brother's dead, isn't he? 
 Then so's your father. 
 (gunshot) 
 No! 
 Hello, Steve. 
 (grunting) 
 Now listen to me very carefully, Steve... 
 Guard : Prisoner, step back! 
 (Victor whispering) 
 Step back! 
 Victor : You hear me, Steve? 
 (Steve gasping) 
 You hear me?!

 Original Air Date on September 19, 2011 
 Hey. 
 You should have to arrest yourself for breaking that seal, Lieutenant. 
 Chin : It's okay. 
 I brought a spare. 
 You're Chin Ho Kelly, right? 
 John McGarrett spoke highly of you. 
 Joe White. 
 How do you know John? 
 We served together. 
 He saved my ass more times than I'd like to remember. 
 I'm here to return the favor. 
 So. What's up, buddy? 
 You've been ducking me for about a week now. 
 I've been a little busy. 
 You've been busy? 
 What are you doing, putting more of your friends behind bars? 
 So you think I had a choice? 
 Danny : Mm-hmm. 
 McGarrett was standing over the governor's body with a gun in his hand, Danny. 
 I had a full SWAT team right behind me, who saw exactly the same things. 
 Now, what was I supposed to do? 
 That's a good question. 
 I'm glad you asked. 
 Because what I think that you should have done is let Five-O investigate, instead of dismantling it. 
 Instead of running off and joining HPD. 
 Running off? 
 Yeah. 
 I knew that I could help McGarrett more as a cop than as an unemployed civilian. 
 Are you two done? 
 Because I'm fairly certain that this conversation isn't helping Steve one bit. 
 I saw Wo Fat at the funeral this morning. 
 Hold on. You saw... 
 Why didn't you arrest him? 
 With what? 
 We got nothing. 
 Ballistics confirmed the gun that McGarrett had in his hand was the murder weapon. 
 And since it was freshly discharged when Wo Fat put it into his hand, lab found traces of GSR on McGarrett's clothing. 
 The key is gonna be proving that he didn't fire it. 
 Okay. Hold on. 
 What about the security cameras? 
 No, they were down. 
 Steve disabled them all during his break-in. 
 So you got no footage of the real killer coming or going? 
 No. 
 All right. 
 Steve got blasted in the neck with a stun gun. 
 He got marks on his neck. 
 What about that? 
 Prosecuting attorney will have that tossed out. 
 McGarrett took out the governor's entire security detail. 
 They can easily make the case that any physical trauma occurred then. 
 Sounds like we got a lot of work ahead of us. 
 Do you guys have a dossier on this Wo Fat character? 
 Jenna Kaye does. 
 She used to work for the CIA. 
 Well, I'll try not to hold that against her. 
 Where can I find her? 
 Mahalo lnn. Room 17. 
 I know the place. 
 Do me a favor. 
 Give her a ring, tell her I'm on my way. 
 He, uh, he trained Steve. 
 Oh. 
 So it's his fault? 
 (chuckles) 
 I spoke to Kono, and she's not taking her suspension very well. 
 Yeah. 
 IA's not backing off. 
 The investigation's still ongoing. 
 They want her badge, Danny. 
 You, my friend, are a ray of sunshine today. 
 It's really good to see you. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Yeah. 
 Williams. 
 When? 
 Okay. 
 Don't move. I'm on my way. 
 What, this was your plan all along? 
 Huh? Frame McGarrett, get him in here so you could take him out? 
 I wasn't trying to kill him. 
 I was trying to save his life. 
 T-trying to save his life? 
 Believe me, if I wanted to gut the man, I would've done it. 
 I stabbed him in the abdomen, low and to the center, avoiding all the vital organs. 
 Why would you do that? 
 (siren wailing) 
 Victor :  Because... that would give him the best chance to escape. 
 Danny :  Escape? 
 What the hell you talking about, escape? 
 What do you mean? 
 I told McGarrett that Wo Fat ordered me to kill him. 
 If Wo Fat wanted to kill McGarrett, why didn't he just do it when he killed the governor? 
 You're the detective, I'm sure you can figure it out. 
 He needed the governor out of the way so he pinned her murder on McGarrett. 
 Chin : And when McGarrett's killed in prison by the man he put away, no one asks any questions. Is that it? 
 (sarcastically): You two catch on fast. 
 (groans) 
 Still doesn't explain why you didn't follow orders. 
 I may be a soulless b*st*rd, Detective, but I'm no fool. 
 Wo Fat is making one last deal, and then he's going to disappear. 
 He's not going to do that without tying up loose ends. 
 And by loose ends, you mean you, right? 
 Unless McGarrett kills him first. 
 (siren wailing) 
 (tires screeching) 
 (sirens wailing) 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Still no sign of Steve, but HPD's out in full force. 
 They want to deploy me in the field to help coordinate. 
 Okay, listen. I need to set up shop here, at my place. 
 Kono : Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Heard about McGarrett. 
 What does he think he's doing? 
 He's going after Wo Fat. 
 Okay. So we have to help him. 
 Yeah, that's gonna be a little difficult, considering who we're dealing with. 
 Okay, Steve will not contact us. 
 He won't want us implicated for aiding and abetting. 
 Okay. So we have to find Wo Fat first. 
 Will Ling might know where he is. 
 Will Ling? Who's Will Ling? 
 One of Wo Fat's lapdogs who happened to, uh, drop his wallet at the cemetery. 
 Nice. 
 If we follow this guy, he's bound to lead us to his boss. 
 I can run his ID, trace his cell, run surveillance. 
 How are you gonna do that? 
 You don't have access to HPD's database. 
 I'll use your password. 
 Oh! That's not a good idea. 
 What? 
 You're not carrying a badge anymore, Kono. 
 I can't guarantee HPD back up. 
 You guys are my back up. 
 (chuckles) Definitely been hanging out with McGarrett too long now. 
 Okay, so do we have a plan or what? 
 Yes, we have a plan. 
 You go after Ling-- let us know if you find anything. 
 In the meantime, we need to find McGarrett before HPD does, okay?

 The car bomb in Hangzhou, that was him? 
 You heard of it? 
 Yeah, you could say that. 
 This Wo Fat likes to get his hands dirty. 
 Hmm. 
 Now that we've exposed him, he's taken a more active role in his own self-preservation. 
 This is very thorough. 
 You seem to know him pretty well. 
 This one was personal to me. 
 (phone rings) 
 It's Danny. 
 Hey. 
 What happened? 
 Yeah, I'll tell him right now. 
 McGarrett escaped from prison. 
 Patience was never his strong suit. 
 Well, we should get going. 
 They're gonna need our help. 
 These things belonged to John McGarrett, right? 
 Yeah. What does that matter? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm gonna take this, if you don't mind. 
 Sure. Where are you going? 
 McGarrett needs our help. 
 He'll be fine. 
 What do you mean, he'll be fine? 
 How do you know? 
 I trained him. 
 (dial tone droning) 
 (keypad beeping) 
 (phone line ringing) 
 Man (over phone) : 911. What is your emergency? 
 Max (distant) : Commander McGarrett? 
 Commander McGarrett, can you hear me? 
 Max, least you can do after patching me up is call me Steve. 
 Oh. Well, thank you... 
 Steve. 
 I'm sorry I broke in your house. 
 I, um... 
 I didn't really have anywhere else to go. 
 No apology is necessary. 
 In fact, I'm quite humbled that you feel comfortable enough to come to me. 
 However, I am curious as to how you acquired that wound. 
 I'm guessing that it was a crudely sharpened piece of unsterilized metal... 
 I got shanked in prison, Max. 
 Oh. 
 So then... you didn't come by that uniform in a legal manner? 
 You don't watch the news, do you? 
 I try not to. 
 It's very scary. 
 My roommate is visiting family on the mainland. 
 You two are approximately the same size. 
 Thanks, buddy. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Who is it? 
 It's all right. 
 Max, don't get the door. 
 It's all right. 
 Max, don't answer the door! 
 What the hell is the matter with you, huh? 
 What is the matter with you?! 
 Breaking outta jail, taking out a cop?! 
 Have you lost your mind? 
 Why are you yelling at me? 
 I'm not yelling at you! 
 Actually, you were expressing yourself in a very loud manner. 
 Hey, zip it, Kermit, okay? 
 Have you lost your mind? 
 What choice did I have, Danny? 
 What  choice  did you have? 
 Shh, shh! Shh, shh. 
 What does that even mean?! 
 You all right? 
 Thank you for asking, Chin. 
 Yeah, I'm all right! 
 Thanks to Max. 
 Mahalo for calling. 
 Anybody follow you guys? 
 Undercover unit tried to, but we managed to shake the tail. 
 Hey, heard you stole a squad car-- where'd you ditch it? 
 A few blocks south. 
 It's behind a construction site. 
 I'll take it up to the North Shore, distract HPD. 
 You  are  HPD, Chin. You remember? 
 Hey, just 'cause the badge says HPD, doesn't mean I'm not Five-O. 
 You know that. 
 You did what you had to do, okay? 
 Right now, I want to find Wo Fat. You understand? 
 Kono's following one of his guys right now. 
 As soon as we get eyes on him, we'll be there. 
 (phone rings) 
 Hello. Yeah, he's right here I'll put you on speakerphone. 
 Joe : Steve, you okay? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Where are you? 
 I found someone you need to talk to. 
 5423 Puuikena Drive. 
 I'll be waiting out front. 
 Copy that. I'm on my way. 
 Whoa-whoa. What do you mean, you're on your way? 
 You're not on your way anywhere. 
 You're a fugitive, you remember that? 
 You heard the man. 
 He's got something. 
 Yeah, I heard him. 
 We all heard him. 
 He doesn't have anything. 
 He's got an address, that's all! 
 Unless Master Yoda can send telepathic messages that the rest of us cannot hear... 
 Actually, Yoda technically didn't have telepathic powers. 
 Seriously? 
 Right now? 
 Please. Please listen to me. 
 Is there any way that I can talk you out of this? 
 Has it ever worked before, Danny? 
 No. 
 Okay, so let's go, yeah? 
 Okay. 
 Wait-wait-wait. 
 You guys can't take your car. 
 HPD's gonna be on the look out for it. 
 Then perhaps I can help. 
 (springs creaking) 
 Yes, you are. Yes, you... 
 100%, you are a monkey in a polka dot dress. 
 And I love you and I'm very happy that I will see you in a couple days, okay? 
 That's right. 
 Danno loves you. 
 All right, babe. All right. 
 You know, I could be wrong, it's rare, but you don't look happy. 
 Well, I am happy on the inside. 
 You're a bad liar. 
 What are you doing? 
 Get down. 
 You're supposed to be the invisible man. 
 Would you get down? 
 Why are you changing the subject? 
 I'm not changing the subject. 
 You are changing the subject, Danny. What's going on? 
 Put your head down! Rachel is moving back to Hawaii, okay? 
 You told me she was staying in Jersey. 
 Why she moving back to Hawaii? 
 She's, uh, she's moving back in with Stan. 
 Oh, man. 
 The baby's his? 
 Turns out she's further along than she thought. 
 And so she's gonna try to make it work with Stan for the, for the kid's sake. 
 Would you get down, please? 
 Would you please get down? 
 I'm sorry, Danny. 
 I'm fine. 
 It didn't work out the first time, so who's to this time would be any different, right? 
 Please don't look at me like that. 
 I said I'm fine. I'm asking you not to give me that look, okay? 
 I'm more worried about my car, okay? 
 (engine revs) 
 (loud rock music playing) 
 (music ceases) 
 Okay, I'll take it from here. 
 Actually, I'm enjoying myself very much. 
 I may even cash in my prehistoric fossil collection to put a down payment on one of these bad boys. 
 Come on. 
 Also, if I don't drive, I get carsick. 
 (sighs) 
 Just don't get pulled over. 
 (phone rings) 
 Hey, what ya got? 
 Kono : Hey, I got your lapdog. 
 But so far, no sign of Wo Fat. 
 Wait. Who's this  haole? 
 He doesn't look like one of Wo Fat's crew. 
 He could be part of the deal Wo Fat's trying to pull off. 
 All right, I'll get a picture and run it through facial recognition. 
 Call me when you get a hit. 
 (tires squeal) 
 Recognize this? 
 Yeah, it was in my father's toolbox. 
 It belonged to a man named Hideki Mokoto, former Japanese pilot. 
 He earned that medal for bombing Pearl Harbor. 
 He gave it to your father. 
 Why? 
 He wants to tell you that himself. 
 Wait a minute, this guy's still alive? 
 Through that door. 
 You have his eyes. 
 Danny :  Let me just get this straight. 
 After Pearl Harbor, this guy strikes it rich, very rich, obviously, and he decides to move here and dedicate his life to cleaning up this island? 
 He called it a personal atonement. 
 Aha. 
 And how does McGarrett's father come into play? 
 Joe :  They met at a memorial service for the  Arizona  where Steve's grandfather died. And it was there that Mokoto approached John and asked for his forgiveness. 
 Ultimately the two of them became friends. 
 A couple years later Mokoto hired him. 
 He'd gotten upset over corruption in the police department and local politics. 
 So he asked John to secretly conduct an investigation. 
 Okay, and that's when John finds out that the governor's in bed with Wo Fat. 
 Yeah. 
 And before he died, John told Mokoto that he had the evidence that would prove it. 
 What evidence? 
 Mokoto didn't know. 
 All John said was that he hid it on Molokai. 
 Why didn't he tell me? 
 Everything your father did was to protect his family. 
 (camera shutter clicking) 
 (camera shutter clicking) 
 Gotcha. 
 (computer beeping) 
 
 
 
 We found this in her car. 
 (water splashing) 
 Tell me, Ms. Kalakaua, what are you doing here? 
 It can't be official business, you're suspended. 
 So you know who I am. 
 Is that supposed to intimidate me? 
 No. 
 That's their job. 
 I'm just a businessman. 
 So what are you selling to Kurt Hauff? 
 The Japanese have a saying:  Iwanu ga hana. 
 "Not speaking is the flower." 
 Good day, Ms. Kalakaua. 
 Here you go. 
 Mahalo. 
 Hi. I was wondering if I could use your bathroom? 
 Of course. 
 You're going to have to buy a shave ice first. 
 Come on, Kamekona, seriously? 
 Let me give you a tip. 
 The key to undercover work-- you got to make it look real. 
 I'll have a cherry. 
 With ice cream or adzuki beans? 
 I don't care. You choose. 
 Beans definitely. 
 (loud slurping) 
 Hey, hungry? 
 It's part of my cover. 
 I think I have something. 
 It's the locker key from your father's toolbox. 
 Based on Mokoto's intel, I traced it to the airport on Molokai. 
 That's where your father hid the evidence. 
 Looks like someone set up a hidden camera. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 That's the governor's study. 
 Chin : Yeah, looks like it. 
 Danny : Who's this guy? 
 That's my father. 
 This camera-- what if it's still there? 
 Steve : If that's the case, then the governor's murder may have been captured on video, right? 
 This is Detective Chang. 
 I think I may have found our fugitive. 
 We'd better be right about this, or we're going to be sharing a cell with McGarrett. 
 I call top bunk. 
 Looks like the camera was pointed in this direction. 
 Yeah, this is it. 
 This is the angle right here. 
 Okay, come on. 
 Chin. 
 That could be a lens right there. 
 You didn't happen to bring your screwdriver, did you? 
 Screw...? I left it at home with my hammer. 
 Man : What do you think you're doing? 
 This is the governor's residence. 
 Who are you and what are you doing here? 
 Lieutenant Governor Denning, uh, I'm Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly. 
 This is Detective Danny Williams. 
 We're very sorry to intrude like this. 
 Wait a minute-- 
 Williams... Kelly? 
 From Five-O? 
 I thought that was dismantled. 
 Yes, sir, it was. 
 But we have reason to believe that there's a key piece of evidence here that has to do with the governor's murder. 
 What kind of evidence? 
 Your big friend out there is quite the entrepreneur. 
 He's telling me all about his plans to open a shrimp truck. 
 He asked me if I wanted to get in on the ground floor. 
 Kamekona's good people. 
 You got a lot of good people around you. 
 You put together a nice team. 
 Are you okay, son? 
 You've been awful quiet ever since we left Mokoto's. 
 What's on your mind? 
 I was only 15 years old when my father sent me away. 
 He did that to protect you. 
 I know, I know. 
 But then I joined the service. 
 All right, I got deployed. 
 I didn't get a lot of time to spend with him as an adult. 
 And now I'm realizing there's all this stuff about him that I never knew. 
 He had all these secrets, and it bugs me. 
 Well, when this is over, maybe we can shed some light on those secrets. 
 Maybe we shouldn't. 
 Why? 
 Wo Fat warned me not to dig into my family's past. 
 He said I might not like what I find. 
 What did he mean by that? 
 Listen, son, you may not have known your father, but he knew you. 
 When you were training at Coronado, he called to check in with me every week to see how you were doing. 
 And as for when you were younger, well, trust me, that was as hard on him as it was on you. 
 In the 34 years I knew your father, I saw him cry twice. 
 At your mother's funeral, and the day he sent you away. 
 He was a good man. 
 And there's no reason to think otherwise. 
 (sirens wailing) 
 We got company. 
 (tires squealing) 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 McGarrett, we have the building surrounded. 
 Come out with your hands up. 
 What are you going to do? 
 Yeah, brah, just give us the word. 
 Down. 
 Down! On your knees now! 
 Get down, McGarrett! 
 Lock him up. 
 I want those two arrested for harboring a fugitive. 
 Steve : Listen to me-- they have nothing to do with this, okay? 
 I forced them to help, you understand? 
 They have nothing to do with this. 
 Hey. 
 Let him go. 
 You heard the man, get the cuffs off him. 
 What the hell is this about? 
 Just relax, okay? 
 You have the wrong man, Detective. 
 McGarrett's innocent. 
 He didn't kill the governor. 
 Jameson (over video) : I am not the enemy, Steve. 
 I have always been loyal to the people who are loyal to me. 
 Is that why you had Laura Hills murdered? 
 Because she was disloyal? 
 Jameson : Yes. 
 (electrical crackling) 
 Jameson : What are we going to do? 
 We have to get rid of him. 
 Wo Fat : I have everything under control. 
 (gunshots) 
 You can't even see it's him. 
 You can't even see it's Wo Fat. 
 No, but what we do clearly see, is that you didn't kill the governor. 
 Commander McGarrett, you have my sincerest apologies for everything you've been through. 
 All due respect, sir, I don't need your apologies. 
 What I need you to do is reinstate my Five-O task force so we can go after this son of a bitch right here. 
 Well, there is no doubt that Five-O had an impact on crime, so as lieutenant governor, I'll grant your request. 
 All right. Thank you, sir. 
 But there are conditions. 
 What conditions? 
 Governor Jameson gave you full immunity and means to basically run roughshod over ever single law on the state's books. 
 That's not going to happen on my watch. 
 You cross the line, you answer to me. 
 Understood, sir. 
 But just so we're clear, sometimes we get put in positions where lives are on the line and we have to make split-second decisions, and when that happens, the line you're talking about gets a little hard to see. 
 Fair enough. 
 I'll reinstate Detective Williams and Lieutenant Kelly immediately. 
 Don't forget about Officer Kalakaua. 
 She needs to be cleared of all the charges pending against her as well. 
 I'm afraid that won't be possible. 
 I'm told Officer Kalakaua is still being investigated by lnternal Affairs. 
 They'll need to complete that investigation to determine whether or not she's fit for duty. 
 Let's go. 
 Danny : Hey. 
 Where is, uh, Kono anyway? 
 I don't know. 
 She was supposed to check in an hour ago. 
 (grunting) 
 (snickers) 
 You won't shoot. 
 You're a cop. 
 (gunshot) 
 You see a badge? 
 (phone ringing) 
 Lieutenant Kelly. 
 Chin, you have to get to Ko'Olina Marina, pier 49. 
 That's where Wo Fat is. 
 The deal's going down now. 
 Once it's done, he's going to disappear. 
 (engine revving) 
 (tires screeching) 
 Kono : That's it. 
 We're too late. 
 I got the buyer. 
 I'll cover her. 
 You guys go after the boat. 
 (gunshots) 
 I'm Joe. 
 Kono. 
 Nice shooting, Kono. 
 I wouldn't touch that. 
 Call Homeland Security. 
 Tell them to get their people out here. 
 Looks like we got the raw materials for a dirty bomb. 
 Chin, take the wheel! 
 Get us close, okay? 
 Danny, you ready? 
 No. 
 Good. Come on. 
 (gun blasts) 
 Wo Fat's not here. 
 Well, he can't be far away. 
 (grunting) 
 (speaking Mandarin) 
 Huh? Wo Fat-- where is he? 
 Where's Wo Fat? 
 I don't know. I don't know! 
 Book him, Danno. 
 Come on. 
 Look, I told you, I don't know where Wo Fat is. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 What are you scared of? 
 Hmm? 
 What do you think? 
 I don't know. 
 That's why I asked. 
 We were supposed to take his money to the Big lsland, meet him there. 
 That's all I know. 
 (sighs) 
 You know what? 
 I believe you. 
 I understand. 
 Danny : Oh, you do? 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 What are you doing? 
 You heard the man. 
 He doesn't know anything. 
 Off you go. 
 You're free to go. 
 Go. 
 Go. Go, go, go. 
 That's good. 
 He's a... a dead person now. 
 If you want to catch a shark, you got to chum the waters. 
 Oh, that... that's the bait? 
 Uh, yeah, he's the bait. 
 What are you looking at me like that for? 
 You got a better idea? 
 Didn't think so. 
 Five-O back in business. 
 For some of us. 
 Chin : Hey, you can't sweat this, cuz, all right? 
 My guess is you're back on duty inside a couple of weeks. 
 Yeah, and in the meantime, there's no law that says you can't grab a beer with friends, right? 
 Yeah. I mean... 
 I mean, I kind of do enjoy not going to work. 
 Get to surf every day for as long as I want. 
 I haven't been on a board in 25 years. 
 Well, why don't you come out with me? 
 I mean, I got the boards and plenty of free time. 
 Steve : You know what? 
 Don't get too used to all that free time, all right? 
 We may need somebody in an unofficial advisory capacity or maybe for a little undercover work here and there. 
 I didn't hear that. 
 Kamekona : If you're looking for work, I could use a pretty hostess at my new shrimp truck. 
 Really? 
 I'm allergic to shrimp. 
 You got to try my shrimp-flavored tofu. 
 Mmm. 
 That sounds disgusting. 
 You just lost a job. 
 (chuckles) 
 Hey. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't thank me. 
 Thank your old man. 
 If it wasn't for his investigation, you'd still be in jail right now. 
 Heard about Rachel. 
 Is he going to be okay? 
 Hey. 
 You're already behind, partner. 
 Drink up. 
 What are you doing? 
 Um, I was going through the rest of the surveillance footage, and I... I found this. 
 This is a meeting between Wo Fat and Governor Jameson... and your old man. 
 Uh, audio's all been erased. 
 That's all we got. 
 Maybe... maybe Wo Fat was right. 
 Maybe my father was dirty. 
 Well, we don't know what this is, okay? 
 This could have been part of your father's investigation. 
 Everything all right? 
 No. 
 We need to talk to Victor Hesse. 
 Whatever deal Wo Fat is making with my father, he might know something about it.
