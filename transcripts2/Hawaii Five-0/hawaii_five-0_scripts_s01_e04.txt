 (shouting, gates rattling) 
 Open it or he dies! 
 Guard : Open it. 
 Open it! 
 (buzzer sounds) 
 (inmates shouting) 
 Get out here. 
 Get out here! 
 Tell him to come out here. 
 Tell him! 
 Do what he says, Dennis. 
 Thanks. 
 (cries out) 
 (grunts) 
 Please don't do this. 
 I got three kids. 
 Shut up! 
 I know he tripped the silent alarm. 
 I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me. 
 Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here? 
 Out the front door. 
 (siren wailing) 
 (alarm wailing) 
 Officer (over megaphone) : Dawkins, you are surrounded. 
 Drop your weapon or we will fire. 
 Drop your weapon! 
 Drop your weapon now! 
 Fire! 
 (gunshots) 
 What the hell is this? 
 His mouth is glued shut! 
 This isn't Dawkins!

Lanakila (Victory) 
 Original Air Date on October 11, 2010 
 Announcer : Flight 116 arriving from Los Angeles. 
 Please proceed to baggage carousel number two. 
 Commander McGarrett? 
 This is about my sister, isn't it? 
 She disabled a smoke detector on board in the bathroom, which is a federal offense. 
 So we arrested her as soon as she landed. 
 Steve : Great. 
 Woman : Jail? Are you serious? 
 It was just a cigarette! 
 Okay, Officer, I think we... we're good now. 
 Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force. 
 You can release her into my custody. 
 Let me check with my supervisor. 
 Steve : Thank you. 
 (Chuckles) 
 I'm sorry. 
 I messed up. 
 I missed you at Dad's funeral, Mare. 
 Yeah, well, something came up. 
 (laughs bitterly) 
 You know the last time I saw you was at Mom's funeral? 
 I guess that's the way we do our family reunions. 
 'Cause I was thinking it could've been cool to have a picnic in between, or something, you know? 
 A picnic? 
 Yeah. 
 A picnic. 
 Something that, I don't know, normal families do? 
 How did you say you were injured, again? 
 Well, originally, uh... playing high school baseball, but, uh, it hasn't bothered me in a really long time. 
 Anything traumatic recently, with the knee? 
 Yeah, actually. 
 I got a new partner. 
 I was thinking more about a physical injury. 
 No, no, this-this guy is like a physical injury, Doc. 
 Ten minutes after meeting him, I get shot and blasted backwards through a window, okay? 
 A few hours after that, he drives a car-- not joking-- onto the deck of a Chinese freighter ship. 
 And, yes, I was in it. 
 The car, not the ship. 
 He drove a car onto a boat? 
 Yeah. He's an animal. 
 And I sorta get the feeling that he's just getting warmed up. 
 Ouch. 
 Yeah. 
 So, how do I fix it? 
 You get a new partner. 
 Yeah, I'd like that, but I don't think that's gonna happen. 
 Well... 
 I'm seeing a slight tear on the ACL. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 So, you're going to have to stay off that knee for a couple of weeks, physical therapy, and I'll put you on (ringing stops) some anti-inflammatories. 
 Can I get those, uh, to go? 
 Please? 
 I'll be back. 
 Hey, stay. 
 I'm not a dog. 
 Stay. 
 (barks) 
 What happened to you? 
 Oh. Uh, I blame you. 
 I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks, all the fun we've been having together. 
 All right. Well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo, I'd love to know what's going on here. 
 We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards. 
 Department of Public Safety's trying to figure out what the hell happened, Where's Chin and Kono? 
 Inside, getting background. 
 Is that your sister in the car? 
 Yeah, I just came straight from the airport. 
 You realize if she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her in the car like that? 
 Can we focus, please? 
 Yeah. 
 Why do you have aneurism-face? 
 I don't have aneurism-face. 
 She gave you aneurism-face? 
 How many times in a row can you ask me the same question? 
 "You gotta seek first to understand, then to be understood." 
 It's one of seven principles of all successful people. 
 I will literally pay you cash to stop talking, okay? 
 Excuse me, Officer? 
 My blue pickup is just around the corner. 
 There's a woman sitting it in. 
 It's my sister; I'm putting her in your custody, okay? 
 Get her some food, take her back to my office, don't take your eyes off her until I get there, you got it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 You happy? 
 Hey. Fugitive's name is Walton Dawkins. 
 He's originally from the mainland, but he did ten years at the Allen Correctional Facility in Cleveland for multiple home invasions. 
 Apparently our guy likes hitting families with big money. 
 Then he violated his parole by coming to Hawaii six years ago. 
 My guess is it wasn't for the surf. 
 Dawkins killed a young couple during one of his burglaries. 
 But get this: according to the warden, he's been a model prisoner up until now. 
 So what changed? 
 Dawkins : Hey, guards! 
 We need help in here! 
 Danny : All right, so right before the inmate collapsed, he was complaining of shortness of breath, pain in his arm. 
 Textbook signs of cardiac arrest. 
 He's a little young to be dropping dead of a heart attack, don't you think? 
 Yeah. 
 Not if he was poisoned. 
 We found this stuff in Dawkins' cell. 
 Nutmeg. 
 Oh, yeah, they got the prison bake sale coming up. 
 Steve : Hang on a second. 
 You can extract myristicin from nutmeg. 
 It's an organic compound, has psychoactive properties, it works like a drug, and in large enough doses, it's lethal and fast-acting. 
 So Dawkins poisons an inmate as a distraction, shoots a few guards, then walks out the door wearing one of their uniforms. 
 Steve : Yeah, in broad daylight? 
 I mean, it feels like a lot of unnecessary exposure for someone trying to sneak out the door. 
 Price of freedom? 
 Or maybe he didn't think he had time to dig a tunnel. 
 What else we got? 
 One of the maintenance guys reported his car stolen from the parking lot. 
 We got HPD a description. 
 Well, let's assume Dawkins knows that, too, so he's going to abandon that car. 
 Chin : We'll find it. Maybe it'll tell us where he's going. 
 Hey, watch this. 
 Steve : Keep your eyes on the guard. 
 Look at his holster. 
 Safety strap's unfastened. 
 Wait a minute. 
 What the hell's he doing with a gun, anyway? 
 Weapons are for towers, gates, and transports only. 
 Maybe it was a rookie mistake. 
 No, not a rookie mistake. 
 He's in on it, he wanted Dawkins to have that gun. 
 So what's in it for the guard? 
 Whatever it is, it was worth putting an armed and dangerous fugitive back on the streets. 
 Hey! 
 Billy Omana, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, put those on. 
 Excuse me? 
 Uh, he said put them on. 
 Who the hell you guys think you are? 
 What did Dawkins offer you to help him escape from prison today? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Billy, so help me God, you answer incorrectly one more time, I'm gonna put those scrubs on you myself and then drop you in general population. 
 How long you think you'll last there? 
 You can't do that. 
 This here says I can. 
 Dawkins said that if I helped him, he'd give me 50 grand. 
 And you believed him? 
 He arranged for $10,000 to be wired into my account. 
 He told me it was everything he had. 
 I'd get the rest as soon as he got out. 
 Where'd he say the rest of the money was coming from? 
 I don't know. 
 All he told me was that there was a lot of it waiting for him on the outside, but in order to get it, he needed to get out today. 
 I'm Detective Williams; this is Commander McGarrett. 
 We hear you and Walton Dawkins were neighbors. 
 Yeah, four and a half years. 
 Warden says you guys used to be pretty tight. 
 Well, in the non-Biblical sense, if you dig what I'm saying. 
 So what happened? 
 Why the beef? 
 I didn't appreciate him trying to gut me with a shiv last week. 
 He said I was asking too many questions. 
 Questions have anything to do with why he bounced today? 
 You know, it's possible I may have some pertinent information, but, uh, you gonna have to play me for it. 
 Play you? 
 That's right. 
 You win-- 
 I tell you everything I know. 
 What's to stop me taking that basketball and beating it out of you? 
 Bring it. 
 They got better food at the hospital anyway. 
 What the hell you got to threaten me with, man? 
 More lockup time? 
 Okay. 
 We might be able to help you. 
 Shave some time off your sentence? 
 (laughs) 
 I'm doing double life, gimp. 
 Excuse me? 
 You got a busted ear, too, man? 
 I'm on permanent vacation, no parole. 
 You could shave 10 years off my time, but I ain't never getting out. 
 So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing. 
 I got all the time in the world. 
 What do you get if we lose? 
 I get the pleasure of beating a cop's ass in front of the whole yard. 
 (inmates cheering) 
 Oh, yeah, play basketball. 
 It's not like we got a killer to catch, or anything. 
 The clock's ticking. 
 He's our best lead. 
 All right, game's to 21. 
 Ten. 
 Man's in a hurry. 
 Okay, since you're a guest in my house, you take it in. 
 (inmates cheering) 
 I got a tip. 
 So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is-is bad. 
 Danno, shut up, all right? 
 Please, do me a favor and don't call me Danno, huh? 
 Yo, how long you two been married? 
 Come on. Play ball. 
 (inmates cheering) 
 Okay, all right, time-out. 
 Time-out. My time. 
 You, uh, never played basketball, have you? 
 No, I've played once or twice. 
 Yeah? Yeah, I mean, I can see that. 
 It looked like I was watching Lebron, and maybe he's just this much better. 
 You know what? 
 Football was my sport, okay? 
 Yeah? 
 Now you tell me that? 
 Hey, you ready to quit? 
 No. - Yes. 
 Which one is it? 
 Can you just give me a second, please? Can I have some space? 
 All right, listen to me. 
 You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him, all right? 
 Play it like it's football. 
 Put a body on him, steal the ball away from him and put it in the hoop, huh? 
 What's he gonna do, call a foul? 
 We're in jail. 
 All right, I can do that. 
 (inmates groan) 
 (inmates groan) 
 (grunts) 
 (inmates groaning) 
 That's game. 
 Let's have it, man. 
 All right, badge, here it is. 
 A couple weeks ago we're in rec watching some tube. 
 Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel. 
 Dawkins almost throws down right there. 
 You should have seen him. 
 His eyes were-were crazy. 
 Just 'cause he changed the channel? 
 No, no, bro, wasn't that. 
 It was something on TV that made him go crazy. 
 What was he watching? 
 Dana, your luxury vacation includes first-class airfare, seven nights at the Kohiko Hotel all-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of The lslands, which kicks off two weeks from now. 
 And since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue, we're throwing in $1 million! 
 (Dana shrieking happily, audience cheering) 
 She's the reason that Dawkins broke out of prison? 
 She just won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii. 
 Okay, but why her? 
 Like, there's not enough rich people on this island? 
 She's away from home, she's out of her element. 
 Maybe Dawkins sees her as an easy target. 
 Whatever. I need everything on Dana. 
 Okay? Travel itineraries, flights, car rental. 
 Hey, guess what? 
 I've done this before, but thank you. 
 Chin : That's it. 
 It matches the description of the car Dawkins stole. 
 Five-O. We'll take it from here. 
 What are you doing? 
 Looking for cash. 
 It's what Dawkins would have done. 
 Empty. 
 Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something. 
 Food or water? 
 No, Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now. 
 If he wants to get off the island, the first thing he needs to do is change his appearance. 
 Coming in? 
 Kono : It's the men's room. 
 It's the luxury of carrying a badge, kid-- you can go anywhere. 
 Lemonade mixed in mayo. 
 It's an old prison trick for dyeing hair. 
 Seriously? 
 Looks like our man's a blonde now. 
 Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street. 
 15 minutes ago. 
 Factor in the time for a dye job, he couldn't have made it very far. 
 He could still be around here. 
 You see that? 
 Kono : Excuse me, sir. 
 Every time I come across... 
 Sir? 
 I was... 
 Gotta call you back. 
 Hey, bro, where did you get the uniform? 
 Traded for it. 
 Not really my style, but the guy threw in a phone, too. 
 Pretty sweet deal, huh? 
 We're gonna need that phone. 
 What are you gonna trade for it? 
 How about a pair of handcuffs? 
 Yes, thank you very much. Okay. 
 So Dana Thorpe and her fiancé, Craig Ellers, landed at Honolulu lnternational earlier this morning. 
 Just checked into a hotel ten minutes ago. 
 (phone rings) 
 Chin. 
 Hey, HPD found the car. 
 Dawkins abandoned it about 15 minutes ago, parking lot Kaako Beach Park. 
 Got it. 
 That's three blocks away from where Craig and Dana are staying. 
 Oh! 
 (chuckles) 
 Oh, my... 
 I couldn't stand it. 
 (laughs) 
 Oh, my God, me either. 
 Never has there been a longer line in the history of check-in lines. 
 Unzip me. 
 (both panting) 
 Um! God, you are beautiful. 
 What's it like being so beautiful? 
 (muffled scream) 
 Clear! 
 Clear! 
 Oh, no! No, no, no! 
 Dawkins is gone, so is Craig. 
 (wheezing breaths) 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay? 
 Craig... 
 We're gonna find Craig. 
 (wheezes) 
 This is Detective Kelly, Five-O. 
 We need an ambulance, Kohiko Hotel. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 On the way. 
 She's not breathing. 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Come on! 
 (siren wailing) 
 
 
 
 (tires screech, siren stops) 
 Hang in there, Dana, okay? 
 Hang in there. 
 It's all gonna be okay. 
 We're gonna find Craig, okay? 
 We'll find Craig. 
 Chin : Hey, how is she? 
 She's in surgery. Didn't give me anything on the way. 
 What do we got? 
 Chin : Hotel surveillance camera picked this up right after the attack. 
 Danny : Doesn't add up. 
 Why take Craig and leave Dana? 
 She won the money. 
 But they're engaged, so maybe they have joint bank accounts. 
 Yeah, or maybe he wants Craig for something else. 
 You know what? 
 Freeze their account. 
 I want thorough backgrounds on Dawkins, Craig and Dana. 
 Run their names through NCIC. 
 Chin, what about the phone you found? 
 Dawkins got it from the car he stole at the prison, but the call history was erased, so I figured he must have made some phone calls. 
 Reached out to the phone company, and sure enough, two calls were made right after the escape. 
 First one went to a local woman named Sofia Archuleta. 
 Danny : Archuleta. 
 That's Dawkins' girlfriend. 
 Warden said she's a regular visitor. 
 All right, so she's the first one he's gonna hook up with for help. 
 What about the other call? 
 That one was made to a local lightweight ex-con by the name of Makani Huku. 
 They spoke for three minutes. 
 Steve : Kono, follow up on the phone call with Makani. 
 Find out what they were talking about. 
 Chin, pull Dawkins' jacket. 
 See if we can find any links on Dana and Craig. 
 Easy. 
 We need to get an address for Sofia. 
 I'll get it. 
 You should change your shirt. 
 You look like an animal. 
 You should go apologize to your sister, too. 
 She's been sitting there for five hours. 
 Thanks. I'll take it from here. 
 Mary, I'm sorry. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 So is this your big "welcome to Hawaii" plan? 
 Pin me to some guy with a badge? 
 Mary, I'm trying to keep you out of jail. 
 Come here. 
 (chuckles) 
 What are you laughing at? 
 Punk. 
 Like seven years old. 
 I don't get it, Mare. 
 I mean, why come back here? 
 You already missed the funeral. 
 Do you think I feel good about not being there? 
 Truthfully? I don't know. 
 I can't tell. 
 I mean, we were invisible to that man. 
 I would have taken anything from him, even disappointment, 'cause at least it would have been something. 
 Listen, Mare, I know this is really hard for you to accept, okay? 
 But Dad loved us. 
 He just didn't know how to show it, I guess. 
 (knocking on glass) 
 Hey. 
 I got that address on Sofia Archuleta. 
 Mary, right? 
 Sis, meet Danno. 
 Danny Williams. 
 What's up? 
 Not much. 
 A tie? Seriously? 
 (laughs) 
 Yeah, what is it with you people and ties? 
 Both : We're in Hawaii. 
 Wow. In stereo. It's great. 
 Thanks. You ready to go? 
 Hey, perfect timing. 
 How's it, haole? 
 Shamu. 
 What's with the stick? 
 You got slammed in a cruncher? 
 Um, I don't know what that means. 
 Sand facial. 
 You ate a big one, huh? 
 Steve : There was no surfing accident. 
 He, uh, he busted his knee getting out of bed. 
 How white can you get? 
 Pretty white. 
 Who's this? 
 This is my sister, Mary. 
 Mary, meet Kamekona. 
 Hey. 
 This is the reason I called you. 
 I want a friendly face to make sure she stays put. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You want me to babysit your little sister? 
 Correct. 
 Shoots. Small kine. 
 All right, she doesn't leave this office, you understand? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. 
 Seriously? What if I have to use a bathroom? 
 Don't spill. 
 Danny : Oh, my God. 
 So inappropriate. 
 Can you quit staring at me like I'm a hot fudge sundae? 
 Got a boyfriend, little sis? 
 You got a girlfriend? 
 I did, but we broke up. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Maybe I can help you get back with her. 
 Kono : Boss, I'm at Makani's address. 
 When I badged him, he tried to rabbit. 
 Didn't get real far. 
 Steve : What did he tell you about Dawkins? 
 Makani runs a fake I.D. mill out of the back of his shop. 
 Dawkins was in here about an hour ago. 
 He picked up a driver's license and a passport, under the name Carl lsner. 
 Update HPD on the new alias, and make sure Homeland Security adds it to the no-fly list. 
 Do you always have to walk so fast? 
 Steve : That's Dawkins' girlfriend. 
 Oh, you know, um, you sister-- she wasn't what I expected. 
 I mean, aside from her hereditary aversion to neckwear, she seemed pretty cool. 
 What are you saying, I'm not cool? 
 Well, in certain situations, like when you've got a gun pointed in your face, or trying to decide to cut the blue wire or the red wire, you're good but, you know, human interaction-- mammal-to-mammal-- room for improvement. 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 Thank you, Dr. Phil. 
 Can I get you guys something? 
 Yeah. Walton Dawkins. 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, yeah, first, Walton Dawkins, but then I would love some blueberry pancakes. 
 I love pancakes in the afternoon. 
 You like pancakes, Sofia? 
 I like pancakes. 
 You do? 
 Yeah. 
 You seem more like a "napalm in the morning" kind of guy. 
 That, too, but... 
 Well, I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to Sofia. 
 Steve : I'm just saying, it's a broad question. 
 Okay, who the hell are you guys? 
 Danny : Sofia, we know that you spoke to Dawkins this morning, and you seem like a reasonable, nice lady, who's just made some bad relationship decisions-- which I can totally relate to-- so we're gonna give you a break. 
 Yeah, I mean, this could really only go two ways. 
 The first is, you sit down and you tell us what we want to know, then you finish your shift and you go home. 
 The second is that we arrest you in front of all these nice customers and you lose your job. 
 And I gotta get my pancakes to go. 
 Right. And because you've been uncooperative and helped a man who killed three people today, you go to jail for aiding and abetting a fugitive. 
 Why don't you take a seat? 
 Danny : You recognize this couple? 
 No. Who are they? 
 They're two tourists that your boyfriend attacked today-- 
 Dana Thorpe and Craig Ellers. 
 They're staying at the Kohiko. 
 How do you know that? 
 Sofia : I have a friend who works there. 
 Last time I went to see Walton, he asked me to call her, and find out when those two were scheduled to check in. 
 That information got Dana shot. 
 Look, he didn't say anything about hurting them, okay? 
 He just wanted to know when they were coming to Hawaii. 
 Steve : Why? 
 Okay, Sofia, Dawkins has this guy Craig right now, and he's gonna kill him, all right? 
 And the only way we can prevent that is if you tell us exactly what Dawkins said to you on the phone this morning. 
 He said something about a big payday... then asked me for my car. 
 Dawkins is driving a 2010 silver Chevy Malibu. 
 Car's got a vehicle recovery system. 
 Can you track it? 
 Kono : No problem. 
 (tires screeching) 
 (computer chirping and trilling) 
 Ready! 
 Danny : VIN number's two-niner-whisky niner-alpha-alpha-seven-niner two-eight-one. 
 Give me ten minutes. 
 Steve : How'd you do? 
 Hey, I pulled Dawkins' jacket. 
 You guys gotta see this. 
 This guy's rap sheet reads like a grocery list he's checking off. 
 In Boston, he's jacking cars, in New York, he's robbing ATMs, and then he graduates to full-on bank robberies in Cleveland. 
 Cops there suspect him of murdering his stickup partner, a guy by the name of Paul Stark. 
 The $5 million they stole together-- never found. 
 Look familiar? 
 That's Craig. 
 Danny : So no wonder he doesn't take Dana. 
 He doesn't care about her prize money, he wants the five million he stole with Paul, or Craig. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Kono. 
 Kono : I got him. 
 They just parked outside Pacific Rim Bank. 
 I watched you die. 
 (scoffs) You watched me pass out. 
 Doctors said the bullet you put in me... missed my vital organs. 
 Well, uh, lucky me, 'cause, uh, now I get to collect the money that you hid from me, Paul. 
 Or, sorry, what are you calling yourself now-- Craig? 
 (chuckling): But you know... 
 I couldn't believe when I saw you on that game show. 
 I thought I was losing my mind, but there you were, in the flesh... a second chance at getting what's mine. 
 No, the money belonged to us. 
 I figured you would double-cross me, so I moved it. 
 Smart boy. 
 But, uh, you're not so smart right now. 
 You listen to me. 
 I know about that Swiss bank account where you moved my money to. 
 Now... here's what you're gonna do. 
 You're gonna go in that bank, and you're gonna wire the money to yourself, and you're gonna get it out in cash. 
 You can't just walk into a bank and take out $4 million. 
 (grunts) 
 You just go in there, and you get me what's mine. 
 (groans) 
 All right. 
 Let's go. 
 (tires screeching) 
 I said no cops. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 (gunshot, people screaming) 
 Go, go, go! 
 Kono : Five-O requesting backup-- 
 Pacific Rim Bank. 
 Restaurant Row. Shots fired. 
 Everybody out! 
 (gunshot) 
 You the manager? 
 Show me the back door. 
 Let's go! 
 (people clamoring) 
 Chin. 
 Chin : I see him. 
 (groaning in pain) 
 Okay. 
 Hey... where is he? 
 He took my car! 
 Kono! 
 I'm on it. 
 Shoulder went through and through. 
 Craig : Dana... 
 Dana. 
 The surgeons are working on her now. Listen to me. 
 Did Dawkins say where he was going after the bank? 
 I saw... I saw a passport. 
 Now that he has his money, he's gonna disappear. 
 (engine roaring) 
 (laughing) 
 (whoops) 
 (siren whoops, chirps) 
 Damn it. 
 (tires screeching) 
 Kono :  Dawkins was on his way to the airport, saw our checkpoint  and made a U-turn. 
 He's in the H3 tunnel, headed into Halawa Valley. Uh-oh. 
 Chin : Uh-oh, what? 
 We're about to lose traffic cam coverage in about two seconds. 
 He's gone. 
 I'm sorry, there's no other cameras on that road. 
 All right. 
 (phone beeps off) 
 One second. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 Why, hello there, sailor. 
 Steve : Cath, I need your help. 
 I'm pursuing a suspect in a black Mercedes. 
 He's headed west into the Halawa Valley. 
 Can you give me a visual? 
 Catherine : You want me to access an IKON reconnaissance satellite for your car chase? 
 This guy's killed three people already today. 
 (sighs) Yeah, look, this could raise some flags. 
 Classify it as an NSA request from a black ops drop box. 
 Okay? Come on, Cath, I need this. 
 You know, you're like the good-looking guy from high school, who knows how cute he is and just won't take no for an answer. 
 All right, I got your black Mercedes. 
 I'm sending you the grid coordinates and imagery now. 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
 Next leave, beers are on me. 
 Okay? 
 Oh, you are not getting off that easy. 
 (phone beeps off) 
 You got her to use a military recon satellite, and then you made a date? 
 I'm a multitasker. 
 Impressive. 
 (phone chimes) 
 There-- address that. 
 (beeps) 
 He just pulled into Makani Kai Aviation. 
 It's a helicopter tour operator. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Fly! 
 Please, I'm begging you. 
 We didn't do any... 
 Will you shut up?! 
 Hey, where do you want to go? 
 There's an airport on the north side of Molokai. 
 Get me there... and I'll let them go. 
 Danny. 
 Dawkins has hostages. 
 No, no! 
 Danny : According to Makani Kai Aviation, their bird took off with a pilot and a family of three coming back from a tour of the island. 
 Chin, where's your friend? 
 On his way as we speak. 
 Danny, contact Honolulu Approach. 
 Get me the direction that island bird is heading, okay? 
 Danny : You got it. 
 Good. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 It's all good, brah. Mahalo! 
 You remember now. 
 You bust 'em, you buy 'em! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
 Hey, you know what you're doing? 
 Get in. 
 Come on. 
 (alarm buzzing) 
 We're running out of fuel. 
 You're lying. 
 This aircraft was topped off to tour Honolulu, not island hop. Take a look. 
 You see that? 
 That's ten minutes, max. 
 It's 15 to Mokai. 
 Look, just find a way, all right? 
 Danny : Spoke to Honolulu Approach. 
 Your bird is six miles east-southeast, heading towards Molokai. 
 Okay. Copy that. 
 Chin, over there. 
 They should be in that direction. 
 Got 'em-- about three miles east. 
 Don't lose 'em. 
 I'm coming around. 
 (alarm beeping) 
 What's going on? 
 What do you think is going on? 
 (engine sputtering) 
 Alright, here we go. 
 Everyone hang on. 
 This is going to get ugly. 
 (alarm continues beeping) 
 (whimpers) 
 They just went down. 
 Yeah. 
 (alarm continues beeping) 
 (panicked yelling) 
 (screaming) 
 (alarm continues beeping) 
 (crashing) 
 Got a single gunshot wound. 
 He's dead. 
 Family's gone. 
 He took them hostage. 
 Look, please, just let my wife and my son go. 
 I'll do... 
 None of you are going anywhere until I get off of this island, all right? 
 Go! 
 Move! 
 (birds squawking) 
 (wings flapping) 
 (wings flapping, birds screeching) 
 They went this way. 
 You sure? 
 Birds fly away from danger, away from predators. 
 Dawkins is making a fast pace. 
 He's snapping branches, he's kicking rocks. 
 The apapanes didn't like it; one of them sounded the alarm call-- off they went. 
 Down here. 
 Come on. 
 Please, can we... can we stop an-and have some water real quick? 
 All right. 
 One sip and then we go. 
 Dawkins : Come on. 
 Come on, come on, come on! 
 They stopped here. 
 No, don't do that! 
 Molokai's rain forest's got pathogenic microbes in the water that will put a man down in an hour. 
 Now, judging from those tracks you found, looks like they drank from it. 
 They won't get much further. 
 Come on, Tarzan. 
 Now we got an advantage. 
 Who told you to stop? 
 Please, something's wrong. 
 We don't feel good. 
 Come on, move! 
 We don't feel... 
 Move! 
 Dawkins : Move! 
 I can't get a clear shot. 
 Dawkins! 
 Dawkins : Come on! Come on! 
 Move! Go! Move! 
 (gunshots) 
 Chin, go, go, go. 
 I got you covered. 
 Stay down! 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 (monitor beeping slowly) 
 (soft gasp) 
 Hey. 
 Craig? 
 (no audio) 
 I want to see him. 
 Please. 
 Dana. 
 Why didn't you just tell me the truth? 
 I was afraid you'd leave me if I did. 
 You were wrong. 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 How could I not be angry? 
 (sniffles) 
 But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark. 
 Everybody deserves a little forgiveness. 
 Steve : Hey. 
 Where's Mary? 
 I got good news and bad news. 
 No, no, no. 
 Good news: I got back with my girlfriend. 
 That's good. 
 Bad news is, you lost Mary. 
 Sorry. She confused me with a Jedi mind trick. 
 You want me to put out an APB? 
 No. 
 I think I know where she is. 
 (birds singing) 
 (sighing) 
 (sighing) 
 (sniffling): What's that? 
 Lunch. 
 (chuckles) 
 (sighs)
