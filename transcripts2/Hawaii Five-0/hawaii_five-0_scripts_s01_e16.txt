 Julie. 
 The HPD escort's here. 
 Stay here. 
 Wait till I come for you. 
 I really want to thank you, Frank. 
 I know how long you've been away from your family, looking after me. 
 It's the job. 
 But I appreciate that. 
 The running... 
 I can't do it anymore. 
 After you testify today, the running stops. 
 You're going to get a fresh start, Julie. 
 I'll be right back. 
 (door opens and closes) 
 Frank Moore, U.S. Marshals. 
 It's good to meet you. 
 I'm Officer Tim Callahan. 
 This is my partner, Officer Joe Lee. 
 We're here to escort you and the witness to the courthouse. 
 She rides with me in the unmarked. 
 You guys are out front. 
 You got a radio for me? 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 Man, when you guys say remote location, you're not kidding. 
 I'll go get her. 
 (shots firing) 
 Man : She's in here.

E Malama (To Protect) 
 Original Air Date on February 7, 2010 
 Danny : Mmm. 
 Chin Ho Kelly? 
 Yo. 
 That is, without a doubt, the greatest thing I've ever tasted in my life. 
 This should be illegal, it's so good. 
 What the hell is it? 
 Coco puffs. 
 Liliha Bakery sells, like, 7,000 of these a day. 
 It's genius. 
 It's amazing. What is it? 
 Butter, cream, chocolate, a little more butter. 
 You know, I always thought that I wanted my last meal to be my mother's lasagna, but that is out. 
 It's out. No more. 
 I want this. 
 I want no dessert. 
 I want no appetizer. 
 Just a big box of these. 
 (chuckles) 
 Nice. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 (beeps) 
 Wasn't that the mother of your child? 
 You know what the greatest invention of all time is? 
 What? 
 It's the "ignore" button. 
 You know, I have a theory-- whoever invented the modern cellular phone also had an ex-wife. 
 I thought you guys were doing better, though. 
 Yeah. But she's still married to another guy. 
 You know what I mean? 
 I mean, it's a lot easier being angry at one person. 
 Besides, Rachel and I, we have our own language. 
 It's an understanding. 
 She ducks my call. I leave a message with a question. 
 She calls me back. 
 I duck that call. 
 She leaves an answer. 
 We don't have to argue in front of Grace. 
 It all works out. 
 Yeah. 
 Kono? 
 Let's go, guys. 
 We got something. 
 All right, HPD assigned two officers to escort a federal marshal and a high value witness named Julie Masters. 
 The federal marshal's been watching her in a safe house in Kahuku, and she's the key witness in a murder trial against this guy, Aaron Brenner. 
 He's a major distributor for the Baja Drug Cartel. 
 Now, the prosecution cannot make a case without Julie, and without a witness, the judge is going to be forced to release Brenner on bail at 5:00 p.m. today. 
 Okay, so the cartel's going to do everything they can to keep this girl out of court? 
 Absolutely. They've been trying to lock this monster up for ten years. 
 And Julie's testimony can do it. 
 All right, where do we come in? 
 HPD's lost contact with the two SWAT guys they sent in to pick her up. 
 I mean, there's no comms on the radio. 
 There's no cell service that deep in Kahuku. 
 What about the marshal? 
 There's no comms on his sat phone. 
 Okay, so what are we, an escort or a rescue mission? 
 Right now we're both. Okay? 
 We need to find her, we need to secure her, and then we need to transport her to the courthouse by 5:00 p.m. to testify. 
 All right? 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 (phone beeps) 
 Bing. 
 Danny (on recording) : This is Detective Danny Williams. 
 I'm not available. 
 Please leave a message. 
 (machine beeps) 
 Detective Williams, this is your ex-wife. 
 I need you to pick up Grace at 8:00 instead of 9:00 on Saturday because Stan and I are going to an event. 
 Oh, my God! 
 (tires screeching) 
 Stay there, sweetheart. 
 Get out of the car. 
 No, I'm not leaving my daughter. 
 (gun hammer cocks) 
 Get out of the car now. 
 Okay, Grace. 
 Get over the seat. 
 Get over of the seat, Grace. 
 Climb over the seat now. 
 You okay? 
 Rachel (on recording) : Detective Williams, this is your ex-wife. 
 I need you to pick up Grace at 8:00 instead of 9:00 on Saturday because Stan and I are going to an event. 
 Oh, my God! 
 (tires screeching) 
 Stay there, sweetheart. 
 Danny? 
 Man (on recording) : Get out of the car. 
 Rachel : No, I'm not leaving my daughter. 
 Man : Get out of the car now. 
 Rachel : Grace, get over the seat. 
 Get over the seat now! 
 (phone beeps) 
 Rachel : Danny. 
 Grace. Where's Grace? 
 Um, she's okay. 
 We were carjacked. 
 Um, they had guns. 
 We're at the police station. 
 Don't move. Don't move. 
 I'll be there in five minutes. 
 Hey. What? What? 
 Grace and Rachel got carjacked. 
 Are they okay? 
 I don't know. 
 Listen, you need anything, you call, all right? 
 Anything. 
 All right. I got to go. 
 Go, go, go, go, go. 
 All right, uh, let's go. 
 Secure the perimeter. 
 We're going in. 
 Guys. 
 Chin, cover me. 
 I got a body. 
 I got you. 
 Who is it? 
 It's the marshal. He's gone. 
 Kono. Go. 
 Kono : Clear. 
 All right. We're looking for two guys, both big. 
 Size 11. 
 There's no forced entry, which means the marshal left the door open for them. 
 He didn't think they were a threat. 
 It's cause they were wearing HPD uniforms. 
 Check the car. 
 Clear. 
 Boot prints from the two assailants. 
 And Julie Masters's heels. 
 What do we got? 
 Looks like our witness was a fighter. 
 I think she hurt one of them. 
 Good for her. 
 Nine mil. Three casings. 
 This is her print. 
 So she burns the shooter and dives through the window. 
 I really hope she's alive, 'cause I want to meet her. 
 Yeah. Looks like she cut herself pretty good. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Chin. 
 Chin : Hey, Steve. 
 I'm back by the blue and whites. 
 You need to see this. 
 What you got? 
 You kill a federal marshal and two officers, the only question is how are you going to get put down? 
 So she's out there somewhere, alone. 
 And being hunted by professional assassins. 
 So we have to find her before they do, and make sure she testifies today. 
 Where do we start? 
 All right. 
 Water. MREs. 
 GPS. Sat phones. 
 Okay? Everything we need to track them in this terrain. 
 HPD is en route with search dogs. 
 Hey. Just got word that air support's lifting off from Honolulu in ten minutes. 
 They can't find a place to land a chopper around here. 
 Nearest LZ is three miles away. 
 That's fine. 
 In this dense foliage and canopy, our best shot at finding her is tracking, anyway. 
 Chin, make sure these are good to go. 
 Copy that. 
 Kono? 
 Yeah? 
 Contact the U.S. Attorney, okay? 
 Find out everything you can about this defendant Aaron Brenner. 
 Then check with the DEA. 
 I want to know who the Baja Cartel contracts its hits through. 
 We need to know what we're up against out there. 
 All right. You got it. 
 Guys, come on in. 
 We need you guys to lock down the crime scene in case the witness or the killers double back. Okay? 
 The witness comes back, you get her straight to the courthouse. 
 The shooters come back, you put them down, and you make sure they stay down. 
 Grace? 
 Come here. 
 (sighs) 
 Come here. 
 (grunts) 
 By the time I saw him, he'd had opened the door. 
 They had guns. 
 I heard everything. 
 Are you okay? 
 Mrs. Edwards? 
 We've recovered your Mercedes. 
 Your purse is intact, money and credit cards all there. 
 Nothing seems to be stolen. 
 Well, that's a relief. 
 Thank you. 
 (sighs) Mercedes? 
 You were driving Stan's car? 
 Yeah. 
 He's in Thailand on business. 
 Sometimes we switch cars. 
 (whispers): Let me talk to you for a second. 
 I'm gonna be right there talking to your mom, okay? 
 You can see us. 
 I want you to get all this guy's information, see what he's doing, okay? 
 All right. 
 Come here. 
 What if they had taken Grace? 
 They didn't. You did a good job and you protected her, okay? 
 What's going on? 
 (sighs) 
 Okay, um... armed carjacking is a ten-year sentence. 
 Okay? Rachel, anybody willing to do that, willing to take that risk, they're not gonna just dump the car an hour later. 
 Okay? You jack a car for money. 
 Your hundred thousand dollar Mercedes, it gets put on a boat to China, and somebody gets a fast $20,000. 
 They don't return the car, they don't leave your purse, they don't leave your cash. 
 So why? 
 I mean, there's no profit motive. 
 Why would someone do this? 
 Mm, I don't know. 
 What are you saying? 
 Anything at all strange going on with Stan at home? Any... 
 No. 
 You sure? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, 'cause I think that there's a very high possibility that someone is sending a message, a threat, telling Stan that they can get to you and they can get to Grace. 
 Stan is my husband, he's Grace's stepfather, and... he is a businessman. 
 He's not involved in anything illegal. 
 I would like to take Grace home. 
 Okay, I'll drive you. 
 Kono :  Prosecuting Attorney Roberts. 
 Officer Kalakaua, I got your message. 
 How can I help you? 
 I'm gonna need a list of the people who knew about the witness transfer today. 
 It's a short list-- my people and a few high-level DEA agents. 
 I'll have my office send it over to you right away. 
 Okay, I'm also gonna need full access to your computer system. 
 Of course. 
 I'll get you anything you need. 
 You've got three dead. 
 How do you know Julie's still alive? 
 We don't, but she got out of the house against all odds, and if she's out there, we'll find her. 
 This is what happened to the last three people who were scheduled to testify against the cartel. 
 How does someone like Julie Masters get involved with the Baja Cartel? 
 She was an accountant at an import company in Honolulu. 
 She didn't know it was a front for Aaron Brenner's drug operation. 
 One night a dockworker is loading crates into a container ship, discovers what they're really shipping. 
 Cocaine. 
 Exactly. 
 Aaron Brenner executed the man in cold blood, and Julie witnessed the murder. 
 He tried to kill her; she ran. 
 She's been running ever since. 
 If Julie's not in that courtroom by 5:00 p.m. today, Brenner's a free man. 
 How do you know they went this way? 
 Tracking humans in terrain like this is about one thing-- seeing what's out of context in nature and knowing what caused it. 
 Like that flat overturned rock back up there. 
 It would've taken a 200-pound man running downhill to do that. 
 That rock also indicated they're about an hour ahead of us. 
 Really? The rock told you that? 
 Hey. 
 See that leaf on the ground? 
 Yeah. 
 It's still green. 
 It was just broken off-- cover me. 
 (shallow gasping) 
 Steve : Walk towards me. 
 I will not fire a warning shot. 
 Julie. 
 Julie, put down the weapon, okay? 
 Put down the weapon and walk towards me-- we're cops. 
 So were the last two. 
 (whispers): This might sting. 
 (gasps) 
 There's no way Aaron Brenner's going to get away with this. 
 You get me to that courtroom, and I'll testify. 
 Chin will get you there. 
 Listen, don't use your gun unless you have to, okay? 
 You don't want to draw attention to yourself. 
 Julie, let me have your shoes. 
 Take 'em off, give me your shoes. 
 Chin... follow the ridgeline, okay, head to Makai. 
 It'll lead you back to the road and it'll give me a better vantage point on the guys when they pick up your trail. 
 Copy. 
 Why aren't you coming with us? 
 I'm gonna hunt down the guys that have been trying to hurt you. 
 Some guys... they're just born without a fear gene. 
 Aaron Brenner. 
 Oh, you must be my conjugal visit. 
 You ordered the murders of two HPD officers and a federal marshal. 
 And you can prove that? 
 Julie Masters can, and she'll be here soon. 
 My partners will make sure of that. 
 Get away from my client. 
 I can't wait to see the look in your eyes when she walks into that courtroom and testifies. 
 If  she testifies. 
 Sheriffs, take Mr. Brenner out of here and put him in the holding area now. 
 I'm lodging a complaint against you for harassment with the judge. 
 You know, some people have trouble with my name, so let me help you out. 
 It's Kono Kalakaua. 
 K-A-L-A-K-A-U-A. 
 Don't suppose you left that door open. 
 No. 
 (phone dials) 
 Woman : 911 operator. 
 What is your emergency? 
 This is Detective Danny Williams. 
 My badge number is 7576. 
 I need two squad cars to 4347 Summer Street, Kuli'ou'ou-- possible burglary in progress. 
 Roger that. 
 They're on their way. 
 Thank you. 
 (sighs) 
 Okay, listen to me. 
 I want you to drive around the block. 
 I'll call you when it's safe, okay? 
 Okay. 
 You, you're gonna go for a little ride with your mom, okay? 
 I'll be out in five minutes. 
 I'll be back  
 faster than you can say, "I love you, Danno," okay? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 
 
 
 (panting quietly) 
 Just like the car, it seems like nothing of value was taken. 
 Stan's office looks like a tornado hit it. 
 (sighs) 
 So why don't you go inside, pack a bag for you and Grace? 
 What? Where...? 
 I want you to go to a hotel for a couple of days until I figure out what is going on here. 
 Stan will be home in an hour and we'll figure out what we're going to do. 
 Okay, Stan does not get to make decisions regarding the safety of my daughter, so she can go to the Hilton with you or she can come on what is affectionately known as a ride along with her father. 
 Okay? 
 I'll pack. 
 But I don't want her to see the house. 
 It will only make her more scared than she already is. 
 Rachel. 
 (sighs) 
 Whatever is going on here, I am telling you that Stan is in the middle of it. 
 Okay? 
 (phone vibrating) 
 (hushed): Danny, are Grace and Rachel okay? 
 Yeah, they are safe, but I am sick. 
 I'm in the middle of a panic attack. 
 Okay, this little incident just shaved five years off my life. 
 (sighs) 
 What's up with the witness? 
 You find her yet? 
 Yeah, yeah, but don't worry about that. 
 Okay, you stay with your family. 
 Don't come out here. 
 Okay, I'm not. 
 I'm actually on my way to the airport. 
 What are you talking about, airport? 
 Why, you going someplace? 
 Well, Stan... 
 Stan comes home and, uh, go offer him a lift home. 
 (panting): Hey... 
 Danny, what are you doing? 
 I'm not doing anything. 
 Listen, okay... 
 (panting) 
 I may not be able to see you, okay, but I can hear you, and you have a tone. 
 Tone. I don't have a tone. 
 I don't have a tone. 
 Okay, you say I have a face? 
 You, my friend, you have a tone, okay, and it's a tone that says "I'm gonna hit somebody." 
 Now, what's going on? 
 Okay, I think that Stan-- in fact I know that Stan has something to do with what happened to Rachel and Grace. 
 Okay. 
 Is that based in anything other than the fact that you hate the man? 
 Yes. It is, okay? 
 They stole his car. 
 They-They got his car. 
 Not hers, okay? 
 And they returned it in an hour, and they didn't take anything. 
 All right, the house was broken into, ransacked, and just like the car, they took nothing. 
 Okay? Does that sound normal to you? 
 All right, my daughter... my daughter sleeps in that house, okay? 
 And-and if Stan has anything to do with it, I am going to encourage him to tell me what he knows. 
 Okay, listen to me. All right? 
 I get that you're pissed, all right? I can hear that. 
 But whatever you do, do not touch him, okay? 
 Do not touch him. 
 Yeah, I understand, but you got to understand that I am a father. 
 All right? 
 And this is my daughter we're talking about. 
 Yeah. You're also a cop with a gun, okay? 
 And when those worlds cross, it gets messy, Danny. 
 Yeah, well, I'm not the one who crossed them. 
 Just don't-don't worry about me. 
 Please. I will handle it. 
 Just get your witness to court, okay? 
 No. No. Hey, hey. 
 Hey, hey. Danny. 
 Danny? 
 (groans softly) 
 You must think I'm an awful person for running back to the mainland when the first trial started. 
 I don't know anything about you. 
 I have no idea why you left, but I'm sure you have your reasons. 
 It's my sister. 
 She's five years younger than me. 
 She's my best friend. 
 All right. So you wanted to see your sister and you knew if you testified, they'd put you in witness protection? 
 I get it. 
 When they first diagnosed Lisa on the spectrum, I was too young to know what it all meant. 
 She has autism? 
 My mom's been taking care of her, but it's getting too hard for her. 
 I came here to finish school and then I was supposed to take care of her. 
 Why would you come back? 
 I didn't think Lisa understood any of this. 
 And then one night, it was late-- it was after 11:00, and she usually goes to bed at 9:00-- she just looked at me, and she said that I had to go back to Hawaii and make sure that the bad man didn't hurt anyone else. 
 Oh. 
 You're a brave woman. 
 Three more people are dead, and I may never see my sister. 
 I have to get back to that courthouse. 
 All right, let's go. 
 (grunts) 
 Okay. 
 We're more than halfway now. 
 You're doing great. 
 (shots firing) 
 Get down! 
 (screaming) 
 (screaming, shots firing) 
 (screams) 
 (grunts) 
 Hold on. 
 Hold on. Okay. 
 I'm going to pull you up on three. 
 Okay? 
 One, two, three. 
 (grunting) 
 Keep going straight ahead. 
 I'll be right behind you. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. It's me. 
 Now, I've pointed him in another direction, but he's going to figure it out soon enough. 
 We've just got to keep moving, okay? 
 Straight ahead. 
 Let's go. 
 (wheezing) 
 You're up. 
 Good. 
 I wanted to ask you a couple questions. 
 How many of you were sent to Hawaii? 
 Seriously? You going to make me ask you twice right now? 
 (gasping) 
 (strained): Three of us were sent here. 
 Where did you fly in from? 
 San Jose. 
 Costa Rica. 
 See how easy that was? 
 Please. 
 I told you what you want to know. 
 I'm not going to torture you, okay? 
 I'm going to save your life. 
 You have a collapsed lung. 
 I need to cut a hole in your chest and reinflate your lung, or you're going to die. 
 All right? 
 You may want to chew on that. 
 Don't make any noise. 
 (man groans) 
 (cell phone rings) 
 (phone beeps on) 
 Kono. 
 Did you hear from Chin Ho? 
 No. 
 Why? You don't have eyes on him? 
 No. We split up, but he has the witness. 
 Don't worry, he'll be fine. 
 What do you got? 
 I still have no ID on the hit squad. 
 Any luck on your end? 
 Yeah. I disabled one of the attackers. 
 He confessed to being part of the team that flew in from Costa Rica yesterday. 
 Okay. I'm checking flight manifests from Costa Rica. 
 He said there were three assassins, okay? 
 Which means we're looking for four people-- three shooters and a cleaner. 
 Cleaner? What's a cleaner? 
 It's another assassin. 
 My SEAL team used to hunt squads like this. 
 The shooters don't know the identity of the cleaner, so if they get captured, there's still another shooter in place to pull the trigger. 
 All right. 
 There was one flight in from Costa Rica to Honolulu yesterday. 
 And... three of the passengers paid in cash. 
 Okay, can you pull them up on the security cam? 
 I got them. 
 You know what? 
 I'm not seeing the fourth guy who could be the cleaner. 
 Run facial recognition. 
 Go through the records. 
 Look for any clues that might lead to the cleaner. 
 In the meantime, have EMS send a medevac. 
 Tell them to insert and then proceed on foot to coordinates 27.97 
 156.95. 
 Will do. 
 All right. 
 (computer beeping) 
 Hey, there. Hilton Hawaiian Village, room 713. Thanks. 
 Just thank God you and Grace are okay, baby. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, listen. 
 I'm on the way. 
 I'll be there soon. 
 (knocking on car) 
 Danny : Hey. 
 Danny? 
 Yeah. I got to talk to you. 
 I'm not asking you. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 You know, Stan,  when I had a daughter, I knew that there were certain things I was going to have to deal with. 
 Texting. 
 An obscene clothing budget. 
 A stroke-inducing cell phone bill, regardless of the plan that I chose, but I'll tell you, there is one thing that did not make the list. Okay. 
 Carjacking. 
 Carjacking did not make the list of things that I thought that I would encounter with my eight-year-old daughter. 
 So I am going to ask you one time. 
 What kind of trouble are you in? 
 This has nothing to do with me, Danny. 
 I'm as shocked as you are. 
 Shut up. 
 Shut up. Okay? 
 I want you to know something. 
 Normally, I would just pull over and give you the worst beating you ever had in your entire life until you told me the truth, but I am working, I am working on my anger management issues, and I am learning conflict resolution, you understand? 
 And I recognize something. 
 I recognize, although you are trying to hide it, you are very scared right now, as you should be, but I am going to give you the benefit of the doubt and I am going to remind you that because of you, people put guns near my daughter. 
 I went to the housing commissioner, Bruce Hoffman, for permits for my new property. 
 Guy hands me a menu like we're at Cipriani's in New York. 
 Everything's got a price. 
 (sighs) 
 Every time I agreed to a number, he jacked it up to a higher one. 
 So I taped the conversation, told him I'd have him indicted. 
 So that's what they're looking for. The tapes? 
 Danny, I swear to God, I never... 
 Why didn't you just come to me? 
 Are you kidding? 
 No, I'm not. 
 Look, things haven't been great with Rachel and me lately. 
 (chuckles) 
 But I love her, Danny, and I love Grace. 
 This deal could make a lot of things right for us. 
 Okay. Uh, listen. 
 Grace and Rachel are going to be staying at the Hilton... 
 You really think... 
 Hey. They jacked your car. 
 They broke into your house. 
 That is my daughter. 
 So, yes, Stan, I think. 
 Here you go. Keep the rest. 
 (sighs) 
 Aren't you the housing commissioner? 
 Bruce Hoffman. 
 Hey. 
 (clattering) 
 I need this room. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Go ahead. Come on, out, out. 
 (patrons murmuring anxiously) 
 I'm Detective Danny Williams. 
 I am also the father of that little girl that was in the Mercedes that you had carjacked this morning, sending a message to Stan Edwards. 
 I have the tapes now. 
 He doesn't have them anymore. 
 I'm going to ask you a question. 
 What do you think would happen if those tapes got out? 
 Huh? 
 Look, look. 
 I... I don't know anything about what you're talking about, Detective... 
 (grunting) 
 Williams. 
 Williams. 
 (panting) 
 You can get my badge number off your forehead. 
 I have those tapes, and will expose you, and if you ever, ever put a gun in the same zip code as my daughter, I swear to God, I will kill you. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 (patrons murmuring) 
 (insects chirring) 
 Stay close. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 (engine not turning over) 
 Damn it. 
 (sighs) 
 Hold on. 
 (sighs) 
 (gas gurgling) 
 Can't you just call for a helicopter? 
 My phone went down the cliff with my gun. 
 We've only got an hour left. 
 This bike'll get us there. 
 (vehicle approaching) 
 Is he one of them? 
 No. 
 Stay down. 
 Chin, it's him. 
 It's the other guy. 
 He's coming around. 
 Hold on. 
 Hold on. 
 Get on the bike! 
 (engine starting) 
 (engine revving) 
 (tires squealing) 
 (engine revving) 
 (engine revving, gunfire) 
 (gunshot) 
 (engine revving) 
 (insects chirring) 
 (grunts) 
 Chin : Get in. 
 (sighs) 
 (phone beeps on, touch tones sounding) 
 This is Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett. 
 The witness, Julie Masters, is secure, and we're bringing her in. 
 All right, I want an armed perimeter guarding the courthouse. 
 There's still a potential assassin who has not been apprehended. 
 We're coming in by truck. 
 You'll know which truck, trust me. 
 Uh, I have an extra pair of shoes and a sweater in my car. 
 We got to go. 
 Thank you. 
 For everything. 
 No more running. 
 Go. 
 (panting) 
 (computer chirps) 
 (chirping) 
 (whoosh)

 I see that you've finally produced your witness. 
 She's ready to testify. 
 My client would like to talk about a deal. 
 He pleads guilty and gives up the names of his suppliers and his coconspirators in the murders of the two cops and the federal marshal in exchange for life in prison with no death penalty. 
 He dies in prison instead of being executed, and in exchange, we get to put ten more Aaron Brenners away for life, Julie. 
 Where's your co-counsel? 
 He has to sign off on this. 
 He's waiting in the conference room. 
 Steve : Hey, Kono. 
 Hey, the cleaner is Brenner's co-counsel. 
 She's a blonde woman, five, seven, and she's in the courthouse right now. 
 Where is he? 
 He'll be right in.

 You know, there might be a few other things I could teach you, but I think you've got the whole ass-kicking thing down. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yeah, it is now, thanks to Danny. 
 Yeah, it was just a... misunderstanding. 
 You know, Stan just got caught in the middle of it. 
 You know, it wasn't his fault. 
 It's over now. 
 Thanks again, Danny. 
 All right. 
 You. 
 I'll see you later, okay? 
 Okay. I love you, Danno. 
 I love you, too. 
 Come on, kiddo. 
 Thanks again. 
 (clears throat) 
 Roberts :  Your Honor, the prosecution  calls Julie Masters. 
 Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
 I do.
