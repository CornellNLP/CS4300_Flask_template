 ACT ONE 
 WAITER [VO] 
Two Absolut Martinis up; another Dewars rocks. 
 FADE IN: INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - GEORGETOWN - NIGHT 
SAM SEABORN is sitting with a reporter, BILLY KENWORTHY, in the bar. 
 SAM SEABORN 
I don’t think we’re going to run the table, if that’s what you’re asking. 
 BILLY KENWORTHY [OS] 
It’s not. 
 SAM 
I know. 
 BILLY [OS] 
Deep background. I’m not going to come close to using your name. 
 SAM 
[laughs] You’re not going to come close to getting a quote, either. 
 BILLY 
Why are we sitting here? 
 SAM 
[taking a drink] You sat down. 
 BILLY 
Is Josh on his way out? 
 SAM 
No. 
 BILLY 
Is he? 
 SAM 
No. 
 BILLY 
I know he’s your friend. 
 SAM 
He is. 
 BILLY 
Did Caldwell say...? 
 SAM 
Billy, I’m not talking about this. 
 BILLY 
Who do I call? 
 SAM 
No one. 
 BILLY 
Just tell me who to call. 
 SAM 
Well, you could call 1-800-BITE-ME. 
 BILLY 
Sam. 
 SAM 
He’s not going anywhere, Billy. It’s a non-story. 
 BILLY 
Okay. You’re lying now, aren’t you? 
 SAM 
That hurts, Billy. Why would I lie to a journalist of all people? 
 BILLY 
Why do you keep looking over my shoulder? 
 SAM 
Why? 
 BILLY 
Yes. 
 SAM 
‘Cause Alger Hiss just walked in with my secret pumpkin. 
 BILLY 
What? 
 SAM 
There’s a woman over there. I think she’s looking at me. 
 BILLY 
Really? 
 SAM 
I don’t know. I never know if they’re looking or not. 
 Billy turns 180 degrees to see a woman sitting on a couch with a drink. She looks 
to see him obviously eying at her. Sam sighs. 
 BILLY 
Yeah, I think she was. 
 SAM 
I want to thank you for the casual way that you did that just now. She probably 
didn’t notice that. 
 Sam makes eye contact with the woman and smiles. 
 CUT TO: EXT. DAWN RISING OVER LARGE TUDOR STYLE HOUSE - DAY 
CUT TO: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
LEO McGARRY is doing a crossword puzzle while eating breakfast. A television is 
turned on to the news. 
 LEO McGARRY 
17 across is wrong. It’s just wrong. Do you believe that Ruth? 
 RUTH 
You should call them. 
 LEO 
I will call them. 
 WOMAN [OS] 
Telephone, Leo. 
 LEO 
I’m in the shower. 
 WOMAN [OS] 
It’s POTUS. 
 LEO 
[sits down and picks up the phone] Yeah. 
 CUT TO: INT. HEALTH CLUB - DAY 
 C.J. CREGG is running on a treadmill while talking to the man using the treadmill 
next to her. 
 C.J. CREGG 
You can have a normal life. You’d be amazed at how normal I can be. See, it’s all 
about budgeting your time. This time, this hour, this is my time. Five a.m. to six 
a.m. I can workout, as you see. I can think about personal matters. I can meet an 
interesting man. [Her beeper goes off.] The trick is... 
 MAN 
Your beeper’s going. 
 C.J. 
What? 
 MAN 
I think your beeper is going. 
 C.J. checks her beeper while still running on the treadmill. What she finds on her 
beeper is distracting, however, and she falls off the machine. 
 CUT TO: INT. JOSH LYMAN’S OFFICE - DARK 
In the dark office, JOSH LYMAN is asleep at his cluttered desk as a custodian 
vacuums the floor. His beeper goes off, waking him up. He checks his beeper, then 
picks up the phone and quickly dials. 
 JOSH 
Yeah. This is Josh Lyman. What’s going on? 
 CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DARK 
The shades are drawn and many of the passengers are sleeping, except TOBY ZIEGLER, 
who is busy typing on his laptop. 
 FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1 [VO] 
We ask at this time that you turn off all electronic devices, stow your tray tables 
and return your setbacks to the full and upright position. We will be landing 
shortly at Washington-Dulles Airport. 
 FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2 
[approaches Toby] Sir, I need you to turn off your computer. 
 TOBY ZIEGLER 
I’m just about done. 
 FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2 
I need you to turn off your laptop, sir. It interferes with our navigational systems. 
 TOBY 
You know when you guys say that, it sounds ridiculous to most people, right? 
 FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2 
Sir... 
 Another Flight Attendant approaches. 
 FLIGHT ATTENDANT 3 
Mr. Ziegler? A message was just patched up to the cockpit for you. I’m not sure 
I’ve got it right. POTUS in a bicycle accident? 
 TOBY 
[stops typing and looks up] You got it right. [reaches for his cell phone] 
 FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2 
You can’t use your phone until we land, sir. 
 TOBY 
We’re flying in a Lockheed eagle series L-1011. It came off the line 20 months ago 
and carries a Sim-5 Transponder tracking system. Are you telling me I can still 
flummox this thing with something I bought at Radio Shack? 
 FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2 
You can call when we land, sir. 
 TOBY 
[calling as she walks away] Also, I never got my peanuts. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. A BEDROOM - DAY 
 Lying on the bed is the woman in the bar. Her name is LAURIE. She is lying on the 
bed smoking pot. 
 LAURIE 
How ya doing, Sam? 
 SAM [OS] 
Let me tell you something. The water pressure in here is really impressive. 
 LAURIE 
I know. 
 SAM 
[walking out of the bathroom, having taken a shower] You could run hydraulics in here. 
 LAURIE 
Want some? [referring to pot] 
 SAM 
I’m fine. 
 LAURIE 
I’m wasted. 
 SAM 
And probably free of cataracts. 
 LAURIE 
I get that. That’s funny. 
 SAM 
Thank you. 
 LAURIE 
Oh, wait. I’m sorry. Your message -- your pager went off while you were in the 
shower. I hit the button because I thought it was mine. 
 Sam reads the beeper, while Laurie recites the message. 
 LAURIE 
‘POTUS in a bicycle accident. Come to the office.’ 
 Sam rushes to get dressed. 
 LAURIE [cont.] 
I memorized it just in case I erased it on accident. [looks at both her and Sam’s 
pager, comparing them] These things look exactly alike. Anyway, like I said, I’m 
totally baked. But um -- no, it’s not like I’m a drug person. I just love pot.  
 SAM 
[slightly preoccupied] Um, Laurie, I to have to go. 
 LAURIE 
You’re kidding me. It’s five thirty in the morning. 
 SAM 
I know this doesn’t look good. 
 LAURIE 
Not that good. No. 
 SAM 
You know what? I really like you. And if you give me your number, I’d like to call you. 
 LAURIE 
Stay right here and save yourself a call. 
 SAM 
It’s not that I don’t see the logic in that, but I really gotta go. 
 LAURIE 
‘Cause POTUS was in a bicycle accident? 
 SAM 
Yup. 
 LAURIE 
[writes her number on a piece of paper, grabs one of the beepers and puts them in 
Sam's shirt pocket, while giving him a kiss] Tell your friend, POTUS, he’s got a 
funny name. And he should learn how to ride a bicycle. 
 SAM 
I would, but he’s not my friend, he’s my boss; and it’s not his name, it’s his title. 
 LAURIE 
POTUS? 
 SAM 
President of the United States. I’ll call you. 
 CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY 
Leo walks past several security checks and continues down the hallway. He passes a 
security officer, Mike, who is sitting behind a desk. 
 MIKE 
It’s a nice morning, Mr. McGarry. 
 LEO 
We’ll take care of that in a hurry. Won’t we, Mike? 
 MIKE 
Yes, sir. 
 BONNIE 
Don’t kill the messenger, Leo. [hands him some papers] 
 LEO 
Oh, why the hell not, Bonnie? 
 BONNIE 
Five minutes. 
 LEO 
Please. [continues through JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA] Hey, Emma. 
 EMMA 
Morning. 
 LEO 
Wilson. 
 WILSON 
Hey, Leo. 
 LEO 
Joe. 
 JEFFREY 
It’s Jeffrey. 
 LEO 
Whatever.  
 He winds up at the desk of DONNA MOSS. 
 LEO 
[calls] Josh! 
 DONNA MOSS 
Morning, Leo. 
 LEO 
Hey, Donna. Is he in yet? 
 DONNA 
[stirring her coffee] Yeah. 
 LEO 
Can you get him? 
 DONNA 
[yells] Josh! 
 LEO 
Thanks. 
 DONNA 
I heard it’s broken. 
 LEO 
You heard wrong. 
 DONNA 
I heard-- 
 LEO 
It’s a mild sprain. He’ll be back later today. 
 DONNA 
And what was the cause of the accident? 
 LEO 
What are you, from State Farm? Go. Do a job, would ya? 
 DONNA 
I’m just... 
 LEO 
He was swerving to avoid a tree. 
 DONNA 
And what happened? 
 LEO 
He was unsuccessful. 
 Leo walks into JOSH'S OFFICE. 
 JOSH 
[talking on the phone] Yeah. That’s fine. Just don’t do anything until Justice. 
Okay, bye. [hangs up the phone] Hey. 
 LEO 
How many Cubans, exactly, have crammed themselves into these fishing boats? 
 JOSH 
It’s important to understand, Leo, that by and large, these aren’t fishing boats. 
You hear fishing boats, you conjure an image of -- well, of a boat, first of all. 
What the Cubans are on would charitably be described as rafts. Okay? They’re making 
the hop from Havana to Miami in fruit baskets, basically. Let’s just be clear on that. 
 LEO 
We are. 
 JOSH 
Donna’s desk, if it could float, would look good to them right now. 
 LEO 
I get it. How many are there? 
 JOSH 
We don’t know. 
 LEO 
What time, exactly, did they leave? 
 JOSH 
We don’t know. 
 LEO 
Do we know when they get here? 
 JOSH 
No. 
 LEO 
True or False: If I were to stand on high ground in Key West with a good pair of 
binoculars, I would be as informed as I am right now. 
 JOSH 
That’s true. 
 LEO 
The intelligence budget’s money well spent, isn’t it? 
 They begin to walk through the busy HALLWAY continuing their conversation. 
 JOSH 
Tell them to send the Coast Guard, Leo. 
 LEO 
The Coast Guard won’t... 
 JOSH 
I understand! But, they’re never going to make it to our territorial waters. 
 LEO 
Thank you. 
 JOSH 
What if the D.A. suspected they had drugs? 
 LEO 
Does the D.A. suspect they have drugs? 
 JOSH 
We could make a phone call. 
 LEO 
Josh! 
 JOSH 
If the D.A. or Navy Intel thought the Cubans were bringing in drugs, wouldn’t we 
have to go out there and search those rafts with, you know, guns and blankets? 
 LEO 
You look like hell. You know that, don’t you? 
 JOSH 
Yes. I do. Listen, Leo. Did he say anything? 
 LEO 
Did he say anything?! The President’s pissed as hell at you, Josh. And so am I. 
 JOSH 
[sighs] I know. 
 LEO 
You gotta work with these people. And where the hell do you get off strutting your... 
 They are walking through the ROOSEVELT ROOM. 
 JOSH 
I know. 
 LEO 
Al Caldwell is a good man.  
 JOSH 
Al Caldwell wasn’t there. 
 LEO 
I’m saying, you take everyone on the Christian Right, dump them into one big pile, 
and label them ‘stupid’. We need these people. 
 JOSH 
We do not need these people. 
 LEO 
Josh. 
 JOSH 
We need Al Caldwell. We want Al Caldwell. We do not need John Van Dyke. And we do 
not need Mary Marsh. 
 LEO 
And I think there shouldn’t be instant replay in football, but that’ s not my call, 
now, is it? 
 JOSH 
[stops walking, while Leo continues on] It was stupid. 
 LEO 
Damn straight. 
 JOSH 
I was right, though. 
 LEO 
[talking to himself] Like I don’t know that. 
 Leo walks into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE where MRS. LANDINGHAM stands up from her desk. 
 MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Oh, Mr. McGarry. Have they done an X-Ray? 
 LEO 
Yup. 
 MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Is anything broken? 
 LEO 
A $4,000 Lynex Titanium touring bike that I swore I’d never lend anyone. 
 MRS. LANDINGHAM 
[following Leo into the OVAL OFFICE] I don’t understand. How did he...? 
 LEO 
He’s a klutz, Mrs. Landingham. Your President’s a geek. 
 MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Mr. McGarry, you know how I feel about that kind of talk in the Oval Office. 
 LEO 
I apologize. 
 MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Just in this room, Mr. McGarry. That’s all I’m asking. 
 LEO 
Yes. [walks out of the Oval Office and sees Bonnie] Oh, Bonnie. Call O.E.O.B. and 
set up a briefing for the Vice President. Let’s coordinate with Katie Simon’s office 
on the appointments. 
 BONNIE 
Should I get everybody in? 
 LEO 
Yeah! [He walks into his office.] Margaret. Please call the editor of the New York 
Times crossword and tell him that ‘Khaddafi’ is spelled with an h, and two d’s, and 
isn’t a seven letter word for anything. 
 MARGARET 
Is this for real? Or is this just funny? 
 LEO 
Apparently, it’s neither. 
 LEO’S OFFICE. The senior staff is beginning to gather. Several secretaries and 
assistants wonder in and out of the office. 
 C.J. 
Is there anything I can say, other than the President rode his bicycle into a tree? 
 LEO 
He hopes never to do it again. 
 C.J. 
Seriously. They’re laughing pretty hard. 
 LEO 
He rode his bicycle into a tree, C.J.. What do you want me to -- “The President, 
while riding a bicycle on his vacation in Jackson Hole, came to a sudden arboreal 
stop” -- What do you want from me? 
 C.J. 
A little love, Leo. 
 LEO 
[to Sam] What do you know about the Cubans? 
 SAM 
I don’t know anymore than Josh. Somewhere between 1200 and 2000 Cubans began 
embarking from a fishing village 30 miles South of Havana. 
 STAFFER 
Where are they headed? 
 JOSH 
Vegas. 
 SAM 
Miami. Though, it’s not clear how sophisticated their navigation equipment is. 
 JOSH 
Navigational equipment? That way is North, I think is pretty... 
 C.J. 
Josh. 
 JOSH 
C.J., if one of these guys could throw a split fingered fastball, we’d send in the 
USS Eisenhower. 
 C.J. 
That’s not entirely true. 
 TOBY 
Oh, for God’s sake. Forget about the journey. Okay? The voyage is not our problem. 
 C.J. 
What’s our problem? 
 TOBY 
What to do when the Nina, the Pinta, and the Get-Me-The-Hell-Outta-Here hit Miami. 
 LEO 
Sam? 
 SAM 
Can’t send them back. They’ll go to jail, if they’re lucky. 
 TOBY 
We’ll get whacked in what? At least... 
 SAM 
Three congressional districts. Dade County. 
 TOBY 
Those seats are gone. 
 JOSH 
Not to mention the fact that it’s wrong. 
 SAM 
Plus that. 
 JOSH 
What about Texas? 
 SAM 
I wouldn’t worry about it. 
 LEO 
Keep Josh in the loop on this throughout the day. 
 SAM 
Me? 
 LEO 
Yeah. 
 SAM 
The thing is, my day is a little tight... 
 TOBY 
Deal with it. 
 SAM 
And I’m happy to. It’s just that... 
 LEO 
Sam. 
 SAM 
I’m just saying, isn’t this more of a military area? 
 The room goes silent as everyone digests Sam's argument in shock. 
 LEO 
Military? 
 SAM 
Yeah. 
 TOBY 
You think the United States is under attack from 1200 Cubans in rowboats? 
 SAM 
I’m not saying I don’t like our chances. 
 TOBY 
Mind-boggling to me that we ever won an election. 
 LEO 
Pat Thomas wants to call up the Guard. 
 JOSH 
He shouldn’t. 
 SAM 
He’s right. 
 C.J. 
You send in the Guard, you create a panic situation. 
 TOBY 
I agree with Josh. And I agree with C.J.. And I agree with Sam. And you know how 
that makes me crazy. 
 LEO 
Yeah... 
 TOBY 
They’re running for their lives. You don’t have to start a game of Red Rover with 
Castro. But you don’t send in the National Guard. You send food and you send doctors.  
 JOSH 
Sam, see that I.N.S. is working with the Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control. 
 SAM 
I’ve got my guy from CDC on the phone right... 
 LEO 
Go. Talk to him. 
 SAM 
Talk to him. [leaves] 
 LEO 
Moving on. Let’s talk about Josh. 
 CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY 
Reporters are milling about. Billy is talking to a female reporter. 
 BILLY 
Al Caldwell scares the hell out of the President, and Josh knows it. 
 WOMAN 
He’s not going to fire him. 
 BILLY 
He’s got no choice. 
 WOMAN 
Billy, the President’s not going to fire Josh Lyman. 
 BILLY 
He doesn’t have a choice. 
 Buzzer sounds to announce the start of a press briefing. They start to walk to the 
Briefing Room. 
 BILLY 
[continuing] Listen, I had drinks with Sam Seaborn last night. 
 WOMAN 
And Sam said that the President was going to fire Josh? 
 BILLY 
He needs these people. He’s going to have to give them Josh. 
 C.J. 
[walks to the podium and begins to address The White House Press Corps] 
Folks? Folks? 
 WOMAN 
Billy, what do you think if he just-- 
 BILLY 
He doesn’t have a choice. 
 C.J. 
Good morning. Dr. Randall Haymen, H-A-Y-M-E-N, chief of orthopedics at St. John’s 
Hospital has diagnosed the President with a mild sprain in his left ankle sustained 
while cycling into a large cyprus tree. 
 The Press Corps laughs. 
 C.J. 
Details can be found in the full report that Linda and Susanne are distributing. 
Along with pool photographs of the President resisting help from a Secret Service 
agent, then falling down again. By all means, enjoy yourselves. Item number two. 
 CHRIS 
C.J., has the President...? 
 C.J. 
It’s a light day, Chris. Let’s just get through this, then I’ll take a couple 
questions. Item number two, the Association of Retired... 
 CUT TO: INT. JOSH’S OFFICE - DAY 
All of the lights are out. Josh flips on a television and starts a video tape. 
It is of a round table discussion show called ‘Capitol Beat.’ On the show, Josh 
is sitting next to MARY MARSH. 
 JOSH [on video] 
--none of your business. Look, if 38 states... 
 MARY [on video] 
No. Well, I can tell you that you don’t believe in any God I pray to, Mr. Lyman. 
Not any God I pray to. 
 JOSH [on video] 
Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted for tax fraud. 
[rewinds the tape back] 
 MARY [on video] 
I can tell you that you don’t believe in any God I pray to, Mr. Lyman. Not any God 
I pray to. 
 JOSH [on video] 
Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted for tax fraud. [rewinds again] 
Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted- 
 DONNA 
[enters the office, holding a coffee mug] You shouldn’t have worn that tie on 
television. It bleeds. 
 JOSH 
I don’t think it was the tie that got me in trouble. 
 DONNA 
No, but I’ve told you a zillion times. 
 JOSH 
What’s that? 
 DONNA 
It’s coffee. 
 JOSH 
Thought so. 
 DONNA 
I brought you some coffee. 
 JOSH 
What’s going on, Donna? 
 DONNA 
Nothing’s going on. 
 JOSH 
Donna. 
 DONNA 
I brought you some coffee. 
 JOSH 
Close the door. [Donna sets the coffee on his desk and closes the door.] 
Donnatella Moss, when did you start working for me? 
 DONNA 
Um, during the campaign. 
 JOSH 
And how long have you been my assistant? 
 DONNA 
A year and a half. 
 JOSH 
And when was the last time you brought me a cup of coffee? [beat] It was never. 
You’ve never brought me a cup of coffee. 
 DONNA 
Well, if you’re going to make a big deal out of it... 
 JOSH 
Donna. If I get fired, I get fired. 
 DONNA 
Do you think he’s going to do it? 
 JOSH 
[beat] No. 
 A knock on the door. 
 TOBY [OS] 
It’s Toby. 
 DONNA 
You won that election for him. You, and Leo, and C.J., and Sam. 
 More knocks on the door. 
 TOBY [OS] 
Open the damn door. 
 DONNA 
[whispering] And him. [opens the door to reveal Toby and walks out of the office] 
 JOSH 
Thanks for the coffee. 
 DONNA 
You’re welcome. 
 TOBY 
Donna brought you coffee? 
 DONNA [OS] 
Shut up. 
 JOSH 
‘Sup? 
 TOBY 
[shutting the door] What did I tell you before you went on the air yesterday? 
 JOSH 
You said, ‘don’t get cute with Mary Marsh.’ 
 TOBY 
I said, ‘don’t get cute with Mary Marsh.’ I said Al Caldwell is not to be treated 
like some revival tent clown. 
 JOSH 
Al Caldwell wasn’t there. 
 TOBY 
He sure as hell was watching. 
 JOSH 
Look, I already took Leo’s morning beating. What do you want? 
 TOBY 
I want you to keep your job. 
 JOSH 
[beat] How? 
 TOBY 
I’m going to make a suggestion, which might help you out. But I don’t want this 
gesture to be mistaken for an indication that I like you. 
 JOSH 
I understand. 
 TOBY 
In preparation for the Sunday morning radio address on family values... 
 JOSH 
When did that get on the schedule? 
 TOBY 
Listen to me for a second... 
 JOSH 
When did it get on the schedule? 
 TOBY 
It’s the regular Sunday morning... 
 JOSH 
[raising his voice] Yeah, but when did we schedule family values? 
 TOBY 
We scheduled it, Josh, after your smug, taunting, you know, calamitous performance 
on ‘Capitol Beat.’ [beat] America for better families. The AAF and Al Caldwell. 
Mary Marsh. I’ve invited them all for coffee this afternoon, along with a couple 
of speechwriters to talk about... 
 JOSH 
What they want to hear. 
 TOBY 
Yes. Yes, sir. 
 JOSH 
If you listen carefully, you can hear two centuries of Presidents rolling over in 
their graves. 
 TOBY 
Come to the meeting. 
 JOSH 
No! 
 TOBY 
Come to the meeting and be nice. 
 JOSH 
Why? 
 TOBY 
So C.J. can put it in the papers... 
 JOSH 
[raising his voice] Al Caldwell is friends with bad people! I think he should say 
so for the common good. Screw politics! How about that? 
 TOBY 
[raising his voice] You don’t run social policy for this government. How ‘bout that! 
 JOSH 
Toby!  
 TOBY 
I’m in charge of the message around here. It’s my job to tell the President that 
the best thing he could do, from a PR standpoint, is to show you the door. [beat] 
Come to the meeting. Be nice. Keep your job. 
 JOSH 
[softly] I’ll be there. 
 TOBY 
[remembering] Oh, take a look at this. [hands Josh a newspaper clipping] 
 JOSH 
What’s that? 
 TOBY 
One of the kids from the newsroom clipped that from the Journal this morning. 
Guess who’s leaving Lennox-Chase to start consulting in town? She’s leasing 
offices downtown. She starts today. 
 JOSH 
Who’s she working for? 
 TOBY 
[smiles] I’m checking it out. 
 Toby leaves the office as Josh sits down, still looking at the newspaper clipping. 
 JOSH 
[to himself] That’s a good picture of her. 
 FADE OUT. 
END ACT ONE 
* * * 
 ACT TWO 
 FADE IN: EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY 
MANDY HAMPTON is driving a silver convertible very fast, while talking on her cell phone. 
 MANDY 
[on the phone] Bruce? Bruce? Bruce! I may have just gotten back into the business 
this morning, but I didn’t come by way of a turnip truck, you know what I’m saying? 
[pause] You jerk me around on this, and I’m going to get cranky right in your face. 
Now, I was your source on 443. Big, fat byline. Above the fold. So, I think it’s 
time to play ‘What have you done for me lately.’ Look, I don’t want to hear you’re 
going to try, Bruce. This isn’t gym class. 
 A police officer on motorcycle watches Mandy run a red light and follows her, 
his siren blaring. 
 MANDY 
[on the phone] I said, gym class. Gym class! [pulls her car to the side of the road 
and stops, still talking to Bruce.] Bruce, Bruce! ‘Cause it’s important in gym to 
try, but it is not necessarily- Look, Bruce. It was a simple metaphor. Now listen 
up! Now, you’re misinterpreting me and you’re misinterpreting the Senator. And it’s 
bush league for the party. And it’s beneath even you’re newspaper. 
 POLICE OFFICER 
[approaches] You know you ran a red light back there. 
 MANDY 
[turns away, still on the phone] Come on. Bruce, please. You huckling me out, I just 
wanna make you cry like a girl. 
 POLICE OFFICER 
Put the phone down, please! 
 MANDY 
Listen, I’m under arrest. I’m going to have to call you back, Bruce. 
 CUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM- DAY 
Leo is meeting with economic advisors. 
 FRED 
A two and a half percent in the third quarter at the end of the fiscal year. 
 LEO 
That’s fine, but the President’s gonna look at the WBO revenue analysis and say 
that economists were put on this planet to make astrologers look good. 
 Josh walks into the room as several people in the room laugh. 
 FRED 
Leo... 
 LEO 
Luther. Ballpark. One year from today. Where’s the Dow? 
 LUTHER 
Tremendous. Up a thousand. 
 LEO 
Fred. One year from today. 
 FRED 
Not good. Down a thousand. 
 LEO 
A year from today at least one of you is gonna look pretty stupid. 
 LUTHER 
Can we go now? 
 LEO 
Oh, go. Get out. [The economists all leave.] 
 SAM 
[walks in] There’s a storm system moving into the South Florida area. 
 LEO 
See, with any luck the Cubans’ll turn around and live to defect another day. 
 JOSH 
Yeah, ‘cause they’re probably all tuned to the National Weather Service, but that’s 
not what I’m here for. 
 LEO 
What’s on your mind? 
 JOSH 
We’ve gotta look at the whole field for a minute, ‘cause I think we’re about to 
get tagged. 
 LEO 
With regard to what? 
 JOSH 
Re-election. 
 LEO 
Oh, we’re not there. 
 JOSH 
Don’t let Lloyd Russell push us around on Medicare or medium range missiles. 
 LEO 
You’re taking Lloyd Russell too seriously. 
 SAM 
His numbers are starting to get interesting. 
 JOSH 
Hollywood likes him. He can raise money. 
 LEO 
We’re not there yet. 
 JOSH 
30 second hypothetical: You’re Lloyd Russell, newly crowned prince of the White 
suburban woman, the upper middle class Black man and teacher’s union. You’re no 
friend to the sitting President. What do you do? 
 LEO 
Put together an exploratory committee. 
 JOSH 
And who do you get to run it? 
 LEO 
You. 
 JOSH 
I already got a job. 
 LEO 
For the moment. 
 JOSH 
Who do you get? 
 LEO 
Well, if I could get Mandy to leave 900,000 a year at Lennox-Chase, I’d get Mandy. 
 JOSH 
You’d be smart. 
 LEO 
[to Sam] Hey, come to think of it, you think she’d be interested in his job? 
 JOSH 
You’re in luck. 
 LEO 
She’s in town? 
 JOSH 
Just got here today. 
 LEO 
What she doing? 
 JOSH 
Working for Lloyd Russell. 
 LEO 
[digests the new information then calls] Margaret! Get me Senator Russell’s office 
on the phone. 
 Josh and Sam stand in the doorway and watch Leo leave. 
 SAM 
Is that the same suit you wore yesterday? 
 JOSH 
Yeah. [beat] You?  
 SAM 
Yeah. 
 CUT TO: INT. DINER - DAY 
At the bar, two female college students are gazing over at a table off screen. 
 STUDENT 1 
I think it’s him. 
 STUDENT 2 
It is. 
 STUDENT 1 
Okay. I’m going over there. 
 The two students grab a magazine from their table as we follow them over to where 
Josh and Mandy are sitting. 
 STUDENT 2 
Excuse me. 
 STUDENT 1 
We’re sorry to interrupt your lunch... 
 STUDENT 2 
We’re juniors at Florida State... 
 STUDENT 1 
We’re with this poly-sci group... 
 STUDENT 2 
Anyway... 
 STUDENT 1 
Anyway, we just wanted to say that we think you’re excellent, and could we have 
your autograph. [hands Josh a magazine, which he takes and starts to sign] 
 JOSH 
Sure. [nodding over with his head as he writes] This is Mandy Hampton. She’s 
excellent, too. 
 STUDENT 1 
From the campaign? 
 STUDENT 2 
Didn’t you two used to be a thing? 
 STUDENT 1 
Jennifer! 
 STUDENT 2 
Sorry. 
 JOSH 
She used to steal money from me. 
 STUDENT 1 
Really? 
 JOSH 
Yeah. Thanks a lot for stopping by. 
 STUDENTS 
Thanks. 
 JOSH 
Sure. 
 STUDENTS 
Bye. 
 JOSH 
See ya. [The students leave.] 
 MANDY 
Listen. You called me. What do you wanna know? Is Lloyd gonna run? 
 JOSH 
I really don’t care one way or the other. He’s a lightweight. I just... 
 MANDY 
You don’t like him. 
 JOSH 
Not when I can’t use him. No. I just wanna know how much trouble he’s gonna be on 
the budget surplus. 
 MANDY 
You should get to know him. 
 JOSH 
I have enough friends. 
 MANDY 
Not these days you don’t. 
 JOSH 
Please, Mandy. It’s not like these people were in our camp to begin with. 
 MANDY 
That’s right, Josh, and they’ve been waiting for you to trip over your mouth and 
you handed it to them. It’s Christmas morning for Mary Marsh. [pause] You’re a 
Fulbright Scholar, are you honestly the only adult in America who doesn’t think 
you’re about to be fired? Do what Toby’s telling you to do. 
 JOSH 
Did you just call him Lloyd? 
 MANDY 
Who? 
 JOSH 
Senator Russell. 
 MANDY 
When? 
 JOSH 
A minute ago. You said "What do you wanna know? Is-is Lloyd gonna run"? 
 MANDY 
I don’t remember. What does it...? 
 JOSH 
It’s unusual for you that you would call a Senator by his first name to a third party. 
 MANDY 
A third party? 
 JOSH 
You know what I’m saying. 
 MANDY 
No, but as long as one of us does... 
 JOSH 
You’re dating Lloyd Russell. 
 MANDY 
Yes. 
 JOSH 
[pause] Wow. That’s great. 
 MANDY 
Are you gonna freak out? 
 JOSH 
No, no, no. Not at all. It’s just -- I always thought he was gay. 
 MANDY 
No you didn’t. 
 JOSH 
I did. 
 MANDY 
He’s not gay. 
 JOSH 
You sure? 
 MANDY 
Very sure. 
 JOSH 
He always seemed effeminate to me. 
 MANDY 
He happens to be very athletic. Plenty masculine. 
 JOSH 
I think he’s a woman. 
 MANDY 
Josh, take me seriously. 
 JOSH 
I do. 
 MANDY 
The New York Times is gonna release a poll in the next few days that brings your 
unfavorables up to 48%. 
 JOSH 
This is the first I’m hearing of it. 
 MANDY 
You’ll have it in about an hour. 
 JOSH 
Where’d you get this? 
 MANDY 
We don’t play for the same team anymore. 
 JOSH 
Wait a minute. One minute you’re giving me career advice, the next minute you’re 
telling me we don’t play for... 
 MANDY 
I’m here for a while. And I want you at your fighting weight when I start 
bitch-slapping you guys around the beltway. [They start to eat.] 
 JOSH 
You and Lloyd Russell, huh? 
 MANDY 
Yeah. 
 CUT TO: INT. LEO’S OFFICE - DAY 
 LEO 
[on the phone] Seventeen across. Yes. Seventeen across is wrong. You’re spelling 
his name wrong. What’s my name? My name doesn’t matter. I’m just an ordinary citizen 
who relies on the Times crossword for stimulation. And I’m telling you, that I’ve 
met with the man twice, and I’ve recommended a preemptive Exocet Missile attack 
against his airforce. So, I think I know how to... 
 C.J. 
[waves to Margaret and walks in] Leo! 
 LEO 
[he looks at the phone, then hangs up] They hang up on me. Every time. 
 C.J. 
That’s almost hard to believe. 
 LEO 
What do you need? 
 C.J. 
Nightline wants someone for the East Asia... 
 LEO 
Send Naomi. What else? 
 C.J. 
There might be a press leak on A3-C3. 
 LEO 
That was Hutchison. What else? 
 C.J. 
Leo? 
 LEO 
Please don’t ask me about Josh. 
 C.J. 
I was going to ask... 
 LEO 
I honestly don’t know anything. 
 C.J. 
You know the President. 
 LEO 
So do you. 
 C.J. 
You know him better. 
 LEO 
I’ve known him forty years, C.J. And all I can promise you is that on any given day 
there’s really no predicting what he’s going to choose to care about. 
 C.J. 
Yeah. 
 LEO 
I’m sorry, I’m late. [leaves] 
 CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Sam is walking along the corridor with his lunch tray, being followed by two 
communications staffers, LARRY and ED. 
 LARRY 
You can’t use those stats. 
 SAM 
The assault stats. 
 LARRY 
The assault stats are wrong. 
 SAM 
We got them from your office. 
 ED 
And we got them from HUD. 
 SAM 
And they’re wrong? 
 ED 
Even if they were right, don’t use ‘em. 
 SAM 
Well, A. Let’s make ‘em right, and B. why can’t I use ‘em? 
 ED 
The 76 year old grandmother. 
 LARRY 
Every time we use those assault stats, Carr and Gilmore come back... 
 SAM 
Who’s the 76 year old-- 
 LARRY 
Every day, 17,000 Americans defend themselves with a gun-- 
 SAM 
That’s flat-out not true. 
 ED 
--including a 76 year old grandmother in Chicago, who defended herself against an 
intruder in the middle of the night. 
 LARRY 
Just don’t use the stats. 
 SAM 
The 76 year old grandmother doesn’t defend herself with a modified AK-47 Assault 
Rifle, Larry.  Unless she’s defending herself against Turkish rebels.  
 Sam’s assistant, CATHY, approaches. 
 CATHY 
Excuse me. 
 SAM 
Oh, you guys know my assistant Cathy? 
 LARRY 
We’ve talked a lot on the phone. 
 CATHY 
Yeah, hi. [to Sam] I need you for just a second. 
 SAM 
Ah, right. [to Ed and Larry] Call me at the end of the day. [walks with Cathy 
 CATHY 
Leo’s wife called. 
 SAM 
That woman hates me. 
 CATHY 
Yes. 
 SAM 
What’d I do? 
 CATHY 
You tried to hit on her at party fundraiser. 
 SAM 
Yes. I meant recently. I meant why did she call. 
 CATHY 
She wants you to... 
 SAM 
For the hundredth time, I didn’t know who she was, and how long am I gonna be 
crucified for that? 
 CATHY 
Well a little while longer anyway, ‘cause... 
 SAM 
Most women, I would think, would be flattered that... 
 CATHY 
Yeah, I think Leo was especially touched that you... 
 SAM 
What’d she want? 
 CATHY 
She was supposed to give a tour to some students from her daughter’s fourth grade 
class. She can’t make it and she wants you to do it. 
 SAM 
I can’t. 
 They walk in the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. 
 CATHY 
You have to. They wrote essays. 
 SAM 
No really, I can’t. I’m not a good tour guide. I don’t know anything about the White 
House. [his pager goes off] 
 CATHY 
You wanna call Mrs. McGarry and tell her that? 
 SAM 
[looking at his pager] Oh God, please let this be a national emergency. 
 Sam picks up a phone and punches in a number off his pager. A woman answers. 
 WOMAN [VO] 
Cashmere Escorts. 
 SAM 
[on the phone] Hi. You paged me? 
 WOMAN [VO] 
Who is this? 
 SAM 
[on the phone] This is Sam Seaborn.

 CATHY 
Where are you going? 
 SAM 
I’m standing right here. Page me and punch in my number. 
 Cathy does. Sam watches his pager. Nothing. 
 CATHY 
You switched pagers with someone. 
 SAM 
A woman’s about to call me. She’s not gonna know why. Put her through. [goes into 
his office and closes the door. He shuts the door and sits at his desk, waiting for 
the phone to ring, which it soon does]Hello? 
 LAURIE [VO] 
Hello? You paged me? 
 SAM

 LAURIE [VO] 
Yeah. You called me. 
 SAM 
[on the phone] Yeah, ah, actually you called me. And that’s because you have my 
pager. And I have yours.  
 LAURIE [VO] 
Oh.

Guys, I don’t have a lot of time to answer questions right now.

C.J., has-- 
 C.J. 
But that shouldn’t stop you from asking them anyway. Chris? 
 CHRIS 
Has the President had any reaction to Josh on the show? 
 C.J. 
None that I’m aware of. 
 CHRIS 
Do you know-- 
 C.J. 
Seriously, that’s it. I’ll get you wheels down time when I’ve got it. [continues to 
wall through the hallway and is intercepted by Toby]

 ACT THREE 
 FADE IN: EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
Leo and AL CALDWELL are walking and are in the middle of a conversation. 
 LEO 
President’s a deeply religious man, Reverend. I don’t need to tell you that. 
 CALDWELL 
No. 
 LEO 
He’s worked with the Southern Baptist Leadership Conference. He’s worked with 
the Catholic Relief... 
 CALDWELL 
He’s spoken at my church. 
 LEO 
Yes, he has. He also spent eight months traveling around the country discouraging 
young women from having abortions. 
 CALDWELL 
Oh, hang on. He never said anything... 
 LEO 
He doesn’t believe that it’s the government’s place to legislate this issue. But 
that has not stopped him from playing his role as a moral leader. Something which 
cost him dearly in the campaign and you know that. 
 CALDWELL 
Why does he insist on demonizing us as a group? 
 LEO 
Because your group has plenty of demons. 
 CALDWELL 
[snorts] Every group has plenty of demons. 
 LEO 
You don’t have to tell me about it, Reverend. I’m a member of the Democratic Party. 
 CALDWELL 
Why does the White House suddenly talk like everyone in the Christian Right is the 
same? 
 LEO 
Forgive me, Al. But when you stand that close to Mary Marsh and John Van Dyke, it’s 
sometimes hard not to paint you all with the same brush. 
 CALDWELL 
We need John and Mary for political muscle. 
 LEO 
I don’t think you do, but I recognize you’re in a tough spot. 
 CALDWELL 
I’m not looking for a holy war, Leo. 
 LEO 
Oh, I know you’re not, Al. And I think that you and I can keep this from escalating 
beyond the petulant woman being angry about getting her hair a little messed up on T.V. 
 CALDWELL 
And there you go again. [They stop walking to face one another.] 
 LEO 
What? 
 CALDWELL 
It was not a little deal. 
 LEO 
No one’s saying... 
 CALDWELL 
And I want to make sure -- of nothing else, I want to make sure that you’re taking 
me seriously. 
 LEO 
You don’t think we’re taking this seriously? 24 hours ago, the President ordered 
me to fire Josh Lyman. I’ve been trying to talk him down from it ever since. He’s 
getting off the plane in ten minutes. It’s 6 to 5 at pickin’ whether Josh still 
has a job. Now, I don’t know how much more seriously we can take it. 
 CALDWELL 
Well, that’s regrettable. 
 LEO 
Yes, it is. [They start walking again.] Anyway, I’m glad Toby organized your meeting 
this afternoon. 
 CALDWELL 
So am I. 
 CUT TO: INT. LAURIE’S APARTMENT - DAY 
Laurie, in jeans in a sweatshirt, answers the knocking at the door. Sam is standing

 SAM 
Hi. 
 LAURIE 
Hi. 
 SAM 
Can I come in? 
 LAURIE 
Sure. [lets Sam in] 
 SAM 
[walks down the long hallway in her apartment] This is a nice apartment. 
 LAURIE 
You saw it last night. 
 SAM 
Yeah, and I really like it. 
 LAURIE 
Thanks. 
 SAM 
It makes very good use of space. 
 LAURIE 
[grabbing the pager off her couch] Thanks. 
 SAM 
The way the ladle hangs from the pegboard. 
 LAURIE 
The ladle didn’t actually come with the apartment. It’s mine. 
 SAM 
Right. 
 LAURIE 
Yeah. 
 SAM 
Um, can I ask you something? 
 LAURIE 
Am I a hooker? 
 SAM 
No. No. What I was gonna say is this: Is it possible, that in addition to being a 
law student and part-time bartender, that you are what I’m certain would have to be 
a very high-priced call girl. I, by the way, making no judgments. The thing is, 
with my job-- 
 LAURIE 
Yes. 
 SAM 
Yes? 
 LAURIE 
Yeah, I’m sorry. I should’ve told you. I wanted you to like me. 
 SAM 
I do. I gotta go. [waits a moment then walks to the door]

 LAURIE 
Thanks.

Listen, I don’t know how often you get up... 
 LAURIE

to a room. 
 CAROL 
Reverend Caldwell, if you all would just step in here. 
 The group goes into the mural room as Cathy passes by and looks into the 
ROOSEVELT ROOM. Several nine-year-olds are waiting patiently with their teacher, 
MALLORY O’BRIAN. Cathy opens the door to address them. 
 CATHY 
Excuse me. Hi. We’re going to be just a minute so why doesn’t everyone have a seat. 
[leaves]  
 MALLORY

 DONNA

 JOSH 
No. 
 DONNA 
You’ve been wearing the same clothes for 31 hours now, Josh. 
 JOSH [OS] 
I am not getting spruced up for these people, Donna. 
 DONNA 
All the girls think you look really hot in this shirt. 
 Josh grabs the shirt and tie. Donna walks out of the office into the corridor. 
 DONNA 
[calling out] Bonnie! 
 BONNIE [OS] 
Yeah? 
 DONNA 
Tell Toby he’s changing his shirt. 
 BONNIE 
Right. 
 We move to the LOBBY where Cathy meets Sam as he enters. 
 CATHY 
You’re late. 
 SAM 
I’m having kind of a weird day. [They begin walking.] 
 CATHY 
Leo’s daughter’s class is waiting with their teacher and a couple of parents in 
the Roosevelt Room. 
 SAM 
I don’t know what to say to them. 
 CATHY 
You’re supposed to tell them about the building and its history. Do you need anything? 
 SAM 
I need someone to tell me about the building and its history. 
 CATHY 
Just fake it. 
 SAM 
I can’t fake it. 
 CATHY 
Of course you can fake it. 
 THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Fifteen or so fourth-graders, dressed in their White House best, 
are sitting patiently along with their teacher, Mallory. Sam and Cathy pull around 
the corner and stop outside the door. 
 SAM 
Which one is Leo’s daughter? 
 CATHY 
What does it matter? 
 SAM 
I want to make a good impression. What does she look like? 
 CATHY 
I don’t know. 
 SAM 
Okay. I just want to thank you for all of your help.  
 CATHY 
Sure. 
 Sam tries to open one of the doors, but finds it locked. Cathy opens the other 
door for him. 
 SAM 
Hi, I’m sorry to be late. 
 MALLORY 
Mr. Seaborn. Mallory O’Brian. 
 SAM 
Hi. 
 MALLORY 
And these are the fourth graders at Clearlake Elementary School who wrote the best 
essays on why they wanted to visit the White House. 
 SAM 
Well, that’s just great, why don’t we get started. [walks around the table] My name 
is Sam Seaborn and I’m the Deputy Communications Director. What does that mean 
exactly? Well, to begin with, I’m a counselor to the President, mostly on domestic 
matters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, the 
Communications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting our 
message and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while my 
functions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it’s important to 
remember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay my salary. 
So I work for you whether you voted for us or not. 
 There’s an awkward silence in the room before-- 
 MALLORY 
Mr. Seaborn, maybe you could give us some history. 
 SAM 
Sure. I graduated law school eight years ago and started working for 
Dewey-Ballantine where I-- 
 MALLORY 
Actually, I’m sorry to interrupt, actually I meant a history of the building. 
 SAM 
The White House. 
 MALLORY 
Yes. 
 SAM 
Sure. [pause] The White House, as you know, was built several years ago. Mostly, if 
I’m not mistaken, out of cement. The room we’re in right now, the Roosevelt Room, 
is very famous. It is named for our 18th President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The 
chairs that you’re sitting on today were fashioned from the lumber of a pirate ship 
captured during the Spanish-American-- 
 The students are enraptured, but Mallory becomes upset. 
 MALLORY 
[stands] All right. Kids, I need to speak with Mr. Seaborn. Sit tight for a second. 
 Sam follows Mallory into the HALLWAY. 
 MALLORY 
Hi. 
 SAM 
How ya doin’? 
 MALLORY 
I’m sorry to be rude, but are you a moron? 
 SAM 
In this particular area, yes. 
 MALLORY 
The 18th President was Ulysses S. Grant, and the Roosevelt Room was named for Theodore. 
 SAM 
Really? 
 MALLORY 
There’s like a six-foot painting on the wall of Teddy Roosevelt. 
 SAM 
I should’ve put two and two together. 
 MALLORY 
Yes. 
 SAM 
Look, the thing is, while there are really a great many things I can speak with 
authority, I’m not good at talking about the White House. 
 MALLORY 
You’re the White House Deputy Communications Director and you’re not good at talking 
about the White House? 
 SAM 
Ironic, isn’t it? 
 MALLORY 
I don’t believe this. [starts to go back into the room, but Sam stops her] 
 SAM 
Wait a minute. Wait. Please. Could you do me favor? Could you tell me which one of 
those kids is Leo McGarry’s daughter? 
 MALLORY 
Why? 
 SAM 
Well, if I could make eye contact with her, make her laugh, you know, just see that 
she has a good time, it might go a long way toward making my life easier. 
 MALLORY 
These children worked hard. All of them. And I’m not inclined at this moment to make 
your life easier. 
 SAM 
Ms. O’Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell you that 
I’m a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing a poll 
that says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House has lost 
energy and focus. A perception that’s not likely to be altered by the video footage 
of the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast Guard are 
fishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to 
blockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine’s about to get fired for going on 
television and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with a prostitute 
last night. Now. Would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which one of 
those kids is my boss’s daughter. 
 MALLORY 
That would be me. 
 SAM 
You. 
 MALLORY 
Yes. 
 SAM 
Leo’s daughter’s fourth grade class. 
 MALLORY 
Yes. 
 SAM 
[pause] Well, this is bad on so many levels. 
 FADE OUT.

 ACT FOUR 
 FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
 Josh, C.J., Toby, Donna and a few aides walk through the corridors toward the 
MURAL ROOM. 
 C.J. 
She’s gonna try and bait you, Josh, you understand what I’m saying? 
 JOSH 
Lloyd Russell. Yeah, that’ll last. 
 C.J. 
Are you listening to me? 
 JOSH 
[repeating] They’re gonna try and bait me. 
 C.J. 
They want you to say something arrogant. 
 JOSH 
I don’t need baiting for that. 
 They walk into the MURAL ROOM where Al Caldwell, Mary Marsh, John Van Dyke, and 
several staffers are waiting. 
 TOBY 
Hi. Hi, good afternoon. We apologize. We’re running a bit behind today. 
 Josh sits quietly, as C.J. and Toby greet everyone. 
 CALDWELL 
That’s quite all right. How’s the President’s health. 
 C.J. 
It’s a mild sprain, he’ll be fine. 
 CALDWELL 
Good, good. You all know Mary Marsh and John Van Dyke. 
 C.J. 
Yes. 
 TOBY 
Everybody, sit, sit, sit. We’re happy you all could come talk with us today. As 
you know, the President makes a usual Sunday morning radio address, and in a few 
weeks we’ve scheduled-- 
 CALDWELL 
Ah, Toby, if I may interrupt for just a momentŠ the goals and spirit of Christian 
and Family oriented organizations, while embraced by a great and growing number of 
Americans, have been met with hostility and contempt by their Government. Now, 
yesterday morning, on the television program Capital Beat, that contempt was given 
a voice... and a face... and a name. [to Josh] I’m referring, of course, to you, sir. 
 JOSH 
Yes, I know, and I’m glad you brought that up... 
 CALDWELL 
I was surprised at you, Josh. I always counted you as a friend. 
 JOSH 
And I’m honored by that, Reverend. First, let me say that when I spoke on the 
program yesterday, I was not speaking for the President or this administration. 
That’s important to know. Second, please allow me to apologize. My remarks were glib 
 and insulting. I was going for the cheap laugh, and anybody willing to step up and 
debate ideas deserves better than a political punch line. Mary, I apologize. 
 MARY 
[pause, then turns to Toby] Good then. Let’s deal. 
 TOBY 
[beat] I’m sorry? 
 MARY 
What do we get? 
 TOBY 
For what? 
 MARY 
For insulting millions of Americans. 
 TOBY 
Well, like Josh said... 
 MARY 
I heard what Josh said, Toby, what do we get? 
 TOBY 
An apology. 
 MARY 
Sunday morning radio address. Public morals. School prayer or pornography, take 
your pick. 
 TOBY 
School prayer or pornography? 
 VAN DYKE 
It’s on every street corner. 
 TOBY 
I’ve seen it. Mary... 
 MARY 
Condoms in the schools. 
 TOBY 
What?! 
 MARY 
Condoms in the schools. 
 TOBY 
Well, that’s a problem. 
 MARY 
What? 
 TOBY 
[raising his voice] We have a Surgeon General who says they dramatically reduce the 
risk of teen pregnancy and AIDS. 
 MARY 
So does abstinence. 
 VAN DYKE 
Show the average American teenage male a condom and his mind will turn to thoughts 
of lust. 
 TOBY 
Show the average American teenage male a lug wrench and his mind’ll turn... 
 C.J. 
Toby! 
 MARY 
School prayer, pornography, condoms. What’s it gonna be? 
 TOBY 
We’re not prepared to make any sort of deal right now. 
 JOSH 
Sure we are. Mary... 
 MARY 
[to Josh] My read of the landscape is that you’re cleaning out your desk before the 
end of business today, so I’d just as soon negotiate with Toby if it’s all the same 
to you. 
 CALDWELL 
Mary. 
 MARY 
[to Caldwell] Please allow me to work. [to Josh] It was only a matter of time with 
you, Josh.  
 JOSH 
Yes. 
 MARY 
That New York sense of humor was just a... 
 CALDWELL 
Mary, there no need... 
 MARY 
Reverend, please! They think they’re so much smarter. They think it’s smart talk. 
But nobody else does. 
 JOSH 
I’m actually from Connecticut, but that’s neither here nor there. The point is, Mary... 
 TOBY 
She meant Jewish. [A stunned silence. Everyone stares at Toby.] When she said "New 
York sense of humor", she was talking about you and me. 
 JOSH 
You know what, Toby, let’s just not even go there. 
 CALDWELL 
There’s been an apology. Let’s move on. 
 VAN DYKE 
I’d like to discuss why we hear so much talk about the First Amendment coming out 
of this building, but no talk at all about the First Commandment. 
 MARY 
I don’t like what I’ve just been accused of. 
 TOBY 
[raising his voice] I’m afraid that’s just tough, Mrs. Marsh. 
 VAN DYKE 
The First Commandment says "Honor thy Father". 
 TOBY 
No it doesn’t. 
 JOSH 
Toby-- 
 TOBY 
It doesn’t. 
 JOSH 
Listen-- 
 TOBY 
No, if I’m gonna make you sit through this preposterous exercise, we’re gonna get 
the names of the damn commandments right. 
 MARY 
Okay. Here we go. 
 TOBY 
"Honor thy Father" is the Third Commandment. 
 VAN DYKE 
Then what’s the First Commandment? 
 A booming voice comes from off screen. The camera moves to show PRESIDENT JED BARTLET 
with a cane standing in the doorway with several Secret Service agents. 
 PRESIDENT JED BARTLET 
"I am the Lord your God. Thou shalt worship no other God before me." 
Boy, those were the days, huh? 
 Everyone stands. 
 CALDWELL 
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
 BARTLET 
Al. What do we got here, C.J.? 
 C.J. 
Well, we’ve got some hot tempers, Mr. President. 
 BARTLET 
Mary. 
 JOHN VAN DYKE 
Mr. President, I’m John Van Dyke. 
 BARTLET 
Yes. Reverend? 
 VAN DYKE 
May I ask you a question, sir? 
 BARTLET 
Of course. 
 VAN DYKE 
If our children can buy pornography on any street corner for five dollars, isn’t 
that too high a price to pay for free speech? 
 BARTLET 
No. 
 VAN DYKE 
Really? 
 BARTLET 
On the other hand, I do think that five dollars is too high a price to pay for 
pornography. 
 C.J. 
Why don’t we all sit down? 
 BARTLET 
No. Let’s not, C.J. These people won’t be staying that long. May I have some coffee, 
Mr. Lewis? Al, how many times have I asked you to denounce the practices of a fringe 
group that calls itself The Lambs of God? 
 CALDWELL 
Sir, it’s not up to me to... 
 BARTLET 
Crap. It is up to you, Al. You, know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do 
anything while I’m upset. [a staffer hands him coffee] Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 28 
years ago, I come home from a very bad day at the State House. I tell Abbey I’m 
going out for a drive. I get in the station wagon, and put it in reverse, and pull 
out of the garage full speed. [Leo and Sam appear in the doorway and quietly enter 
into the room.] Except I forgot to open the garage door. 
 Bartlet pauses to take a drink of his coffee and smile at Josh, who smiles back 
uncomfortably. 
 BARTLET [cont.] 
Abbey told me to not drive while I was upset and she was right. She was right 
yesterday when she told me not to get on that damn bicycle while I was upset, but 
I did it anyway, and I guess I was just about as angry as I’ve ever been in my life. 
It seems my granddaughter, Annie, had given an interview in one of the teen magazines. 
And somewhere between movie stars and make-up tips, she talked about her feelings on 
a woman’s right to choose. Now Annie, all of 12, has always been precocious, but she’s 
got a good head on her shoulders and I like it when she uses it, so I couldn’t 
understand it when her mother called me in tears yesterday. I said, "Elizabeth, 
what’s wrong?" She said, "It’s Annie." Now I love my family and I’ve read my bible 
from cover to cover so I want you to tell me, from what part of the Holy Scripture 
do you suppose the Lambs of God drew their Divine inspiration when they sent my 12 
year-old granddaughter a Raggedy Ann doll with a knife stuck through its throat? 
[pause] You’ll denounce these people, Al. You’ll do it publicly. And until you do, 
you can all get your fat asses out of my White House. [Everyone is frozen.] 
C.J., show these people out. 
 MARY MARSH 
I believe we can find the door. 
 BARTLET 
Find it now. 
 The group leaves the room quickly and quietly. 
 CALDWELL 
[quietly to Leo] We’ll fix this, Leo. 
 LEO 
See that you do. 
 Bartlet has gone out the side door, through an adjoining room and into THE OVAL OFFICE. 
The staff begins recovering from this last moment and following the President. 
 JOSH 
Okay, can I just say that, as it turned out, I was the calmest person in the room? 
 TOBY 
Hey... 
 C.J. 
Way to stay cool. 
 TOBY 
I am not empowered to auction off the Bill of Rights. 
 JOSH 
I thought you were going to take a swing at her there. 
 TOBY 
She was calling us New York Jews, Josh. 
 JOSH 
Yeah, but being from Connecticut, I didn’t mind so much. [They enter the Oval Office.] 
You, C.J., on the other hand, were brilliant. I particularly liked the part where 
you said nothing at all. 
 C.J. 
I’m sorry, Josh, I was distracted. All I could really think about was Lloyd Russell 
and your girlfriend. 
 SAM 
Mandy and Lloyd Russell? 
 JOSH 
I’ll be puttin’ an end to that. 
 BARTLET 
"Hello, Mr. President. Did you have a nice trip, sir? How’s the ankle, sir?" 
Seems to me we’ve all been taking a little break. Thinking about our personal lives 
or thinking about keeping our jobs. Breaks are good. It’s not a bad idea taking a 
break every now and then. I know how hard you all work. 
 MARGARET, Leo’s secretary, brings Leo a note, which he slips to Bartlet after 
reading it.  
 BARTLET 
[speaks while reading the note] There was this time that Annie came to me with this 
press clipping. Seems these theologians down in South America were very excited 
because this little girl from Chile had sliced open a tomato, and the inside flesh 
of this tomato had actually formed a perfect Rosary. The theologians commented that 
they thought this was a very impressive girl. Annie commented that she thought it 
was a very impressive tomato. I don’t know what made me think of that. 
[reporting the information from the slip of paper] Naval Intelligence reports 
approximately 1200 Cubans left Havana this morning. Approximately 700 turned back 
due to severe weather, some 350 are missing and presumed dead, 137 have been taken 
into custody in Miami and are seeking asylum. [pause] With the clothes on their 
backs, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn’t die want a better life. 
And they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break’s over. 
 LEO 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
 The senior staff say their thanks and begin to leave the office. Josh is the last 
to the door. 
 BARTLET 
Josh. "Too busy being indicted for tax fraud"? [beat] Don’t ever do it again. 
 JOSH 
[quietly] Yes sir. [exits] 
 BARTLET 
[calls] Mrs. Landingham. What’s next? 
 MRS. LANDINGHAM 
Governor Thomas and the Majority Leader have asked to be conferenced in and the 
group from NASA is assembling for their photo-op. At seven o’clock, you have... 
 Mrs. Landingham continues as the camera moves and shows us an overhead shot of the 
Presidential Seal and the Oval Office.
