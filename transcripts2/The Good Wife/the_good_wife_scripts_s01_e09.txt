 Bail is hereby denied. 
 This court is adjourned. 
 (gavel bangs) 
 Peter didn't make bail. 
 My next guest has spent quality time with some Of the biggest political names in chicago politics, And she's working on a shocking tell-all book. 
 Please welcome amber madison. 
 (applause) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hi, how are you? 
 So nice to meet you. 
 (amber laughs) 
 So this d.A.... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Now, did he...? 
 Uh, state's attorney. 
 Okay. 
 Right, whatever, this d.A.... (laughs) so now, Did he, um, suck on your toes All the time or was that just, like, a one-time shot? 
 It was a... Two-time thing. 
 (audience laughing) 
 Chelsea: Well, of course, I mean, once you shrimp on somebody once, You kind of have to follow up with another sucking session. 
 And what's the most disgusting thing That he ever asked you to do to him? 
 Uh, well... 
 Like really, really disgusting. 
 It wasn't the most disgusting, But he... 
 Zach: Oh... 
 Alicia: Kids, breakfast! 
 This is something new 
 I found at the market. 
 It's called fruit. 
 I thought we'd give it a try this morning. 
 You're really happy this morning. 
 Yes, I started drinking earlier. 
 Okay, something is going on. 
 No, we just have to get to school. 
 Yeah. 
 Love you, mom. 
 Love you, too. 
 Woman: Look, amber madison is yesterday's news. 
 Thank you. 
 She'd say anything to sell a book. 
 It doesn't warrant a comment. 
 Man: Miss poole, he's not in court. 
 I put him in the jury room. 
 Thank you. 
 I don't think we'll need damage control. 
 It's just gossip page fodder. 
 I'm not getting political calls. 
 Who's he...? 
 Golden: He's trying his wife. 
 I usually don't ask this, but how much is true? 
 From what I can tell, not much. 
 So what are we dealing with? 
 A call girl stretching her 15 minutes To 20 or...? 
 Or...? 
 I had a married client who had a girlfriend Who wouldn't go away. 
 She kept making trouble At inopportune moments. 
 We offered her money, a singing contract, everything. 
 It turns out she wanted Something I couldn't offer her-- 
 My client. 
 She was in love with him and she was bitter. 
 Is that a possibility here? 
 Why don't you ask him? 
 Peter: Yes. 
 This is her husband. 
 Could you tell her to call me as quickly as possible? 
 Thank you. 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 That's good, the genuine is important right now. 
 Kya. 
 Unless you can get me in touch with my wife, I think you should shut up. 
 (ringing) 
 Your husband phoned. 
 My...? Oh, did he say what it was about? 
 No, but I-I think he thought you'd know what it was about. 
 Oh. 
 And someone from page six-- 
 He phoned, wanting comment. 
 On? 
 He didn't say. 
 I don't think it was about a case. 
 Cary: Courtney, You got a minute? 
 What's going on? 
 Courtney. 
 Just wait. 
 (typing) 
 Chelsea: So now we're getting to a comfortable place. Thank you. 
 Now, what kind of code Are we talking about here? 
 Uh, well, I would call Peter's house And hang up after one ring, and then he would know That the next call was going to be from me. 
 Chelsea: Are you 14? 
 No, I mean, you're a call girl. 
 (audience laughing) 
 I mean, that just sounds pretty... 
 Anyway, so about that threesome... 
 (laughter) 
 Um, it was nothing. 
 It-- he said that it was the reason That he came to me in the first place. 
 His wife wouldn't agree to a threesome. 
 I think he thought that she was a little... 
 Frigid. 
 You can say it. 
 I mean, everyone-- I-I've seen her, I think she looks frigid. 
 I mean, I know frigid And-- see, there's a lesson here for everybody. 
 When your spouse asks you for a threesome... 
 And he offered you a job, is that right? 
 Yes, on his campaign. 
 Um, he said that he was going to divorce his wife And that I would work as part of his outreach for at-risk kids. 
 Chelsea: And you believed him? 
 (knocking) 
 I'm sorry, will and diane need you upstairs. 
 Amber: Peter was very compassionate, Um, very loving, A very, very good lover. 
 (paralegals murmuring and chuckling) 
 Diane: We need to do damage control. 
 Will: This is beyond damage control. 
 Diane: Don't let's get into that now, please. 
 What? We can't just let this sit. 
 You're like fletcher christian Just itching to throw bligh overboard. 
 Yes, and mr. Christian was the hero. 
 Here. 
 Newscaster: Attorneys at stern, lockhart & gardner Have had no comment on this latest embarrassment. 
 It appears that jonas stern's single car accident Caused no injuries. 
 Stern, chicago's renowned civil rights attorney, First gained notoriety Crusading against police brutality in the 1970s. 
 It's unbelievable. 
 Guy hasn't stepped foot in the office for over a year... 
 I talked to his ex-wife. 
 Which one? 
 Cassandra. 
 She said spending so much time away mellowed him. 
 Yep, like rotting fruit. 
 Remember, he spoke at school? 
 He filled Hart auditorium, diane, on-- what was it? 
 Universal jurisdiction. 
 Stern used a glass of water and a hammer To demonstrate the difference between... 
 International norms versus state sovereignty. 
 Right, you were really into him. 
 I found him inspiring. 
 Will: Well, he wanted to thank you. 
 Me? 
 Yeah. 
 The slip and fall, his daughter's defense. 
 I guess she spoke highly of you. 
 He's on his way over. 
 Oh, good, julius kreutzer has agreed to handle the dui. 
 Kreutzer? Great. 
 We'll need to enlarge the conference room. 
 He's the only lawyer I know With an ego bigger than stern's. 
 We need this to go away quietly. 
 Diane, have you ever known stern to do anything quietly? 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 (singsongy): Jeanette! 
 Oh, it's so good to see you! 
 Oh, baby. 
 How you doing? 
 Oh, you're as beautiful as ever, sweetheart. 
 Hey, mike, arnie, how you doing? 
 Good to see you. 
 Where the hell did we get that? 
 That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen. 
 But you haven't lived 
 Until you've ridden horseback at midnight Across the timihani plateau. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Here. 
 Who buys this stuff? 
 (chuckles) 
 My partners! 
 (laughter) 
 Hey. 
 How are you, lovely? 
 So, have you two bankrupted us yet? 
 Nope, you're doing that all on your own. 
 Worry beads. 
 They were carved by a 70-year-old Balinese woman. 
 Wear them, And you'll never lose in court. 
 Thanks. 
 For you, my dear, a chinese perfume jar Said to contain the soul of a ming dynasty poet. 
 Funny, I was looking for a ming poet at barneys. 
 Jonas, this is... 
 So, where is That jackass kreutzer? 
 Will: It's over, you know that. 
 I don't know anything. 
 His clients are going to mutiny. 
 Stern's clients understand His proclivities. 
 It's a new economy, diane. 
 He's a managing partner, will. 
 It would take a vote Of the general partnership to oust him. 
 Which half are itching to do. 
 This dui is giving them cause. 
 Have some respect. 
 Mr. Stern would like to speak to you two. 
 He fired you. 
 I'll bill you for an hour. 
 I'm thinking of defending myself. 
 Jonas, you are not going to defend yourself. 
 It's trumped up, you know that. 
 All that time I spent on the police review board, The chicago cops can't wait to knock me down a peg. 
 This is your second offense. 
 Ah, worst-case scenario, I lose my license for a year. 
 Were you drinking, jonas? 
 Four scotch and sodas. 
 I was blitzed. 
 (chuckles) 
 After the accident. 
 I crashed, I was shook up. 
 I walked into the westwood tavern And downed down four scotch and sodas. 
 Oh, god. 
 The police are going to have a hard time discerning The drinking I did before and the drinking I did after. 
 You're like an 18-year-old. 
 Is that her-- 
 The state's attorney's wife, The one that defended my daughter? 
 Yes. 
 I want her. 
 I want her as a front. 
 I'll defend myself through her. 
 This is a bad idea, jonas. 
 I want her To represent me. 
 Okay, this won't take long. 
 It's okay, Mom, really. 
 No one's saying anything. 
 All right, well, then, just listen for my sake. 
 I want you to know what's true and what's not. 
 I don't know what your father told this woman, And I can't stop her from saying what she's saying, But I can always tell you the truth, And none of this is true. 
 Thanks, mom. 
 What does dad say is true? 
 I don't know. 
 He hasn't talked to you? 
 He... 
 He tried, but I haven't returned his call. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 I've... I've been angry. 
 But if it's untrue... 
 It's still true that he slept with her. 
 Yeah, but he already apologized for that. 
 It doesn't make it any less wrong. 
 Okay, okay, it was my mistake. 
 I should have called him back and I will. 
 I will talk to your dad. 
 Why don't we talk to him, Ask him everything? 
 What, like if he had a three-way? 
 It's not a three-way, it's a threesome. 
 Yeah, but you can still say "three-way." 
 No, you can't. 
 Okay. 
 Family meeting's over. 
 It's a plea is all. 
 You'll be fine, mrs. Florrick. 
 I'll tell you exactly what to say. 
 Could you tell me now? 
 No. 
 The best arguments are spontaneous. 
 You know who told me that? 
 Justice powell-- 
 The oral arguments for ricardo v. Ohio. 
 I did my law review on ricardo. 
 I was brilliant on ricardo, wasn't I? You were. Yeah, it's harder doing great these days. Fewer opportunities. I, uh... Chased you out Of the gossip columns, didn't I? Yes. Thank you. Well, the first time that a dui trumped a threesome. Your honor, matan brody Of the state's attorney's office. Mr. Stern, you may want in on this. The people have added a charge To the complaint, your honor. Aggravated battery to a police officer. That's ridiculous. You tacked that on for payback. Are you representing yourself here, Mr. Stern? Your honor, this is payback. It's clearly unorthodox, clear... Selective prosecution. Selective prosecution in direct... Contradiction of the 14th amendment. Of the 14th amendment right Guaranteeing equal protection. You hit a cop, mr. Stern. You can't hit a cop. Speak to me, Not my client, sir. Aggravated battery is a felony, Your honor, carrying a prison term Of two to five years. As such, both this charge and the dui Now have to be heard in felony court. That's too bad, mr. Stern. I was looking forward to this. Thank you, mrs. Florrick. I can take it from here. Is that the discovery packet? It is. Sir, if I'm representing you, I think I should look at the discovery, too. Brenda, dinner at gibson's. Got it. Mr. Stern, I heard you speak at georgetown once, And you said, "even the best legal mind Requires the socratic method to keep itself sharp"" So... Here I am. Alicia: So, you had a few drinks At the party before the accident. I had one drink, and they don't know that. Because, after the accident, you had a few more? That's perfectly legal. You blew a .15 On the breathalyzer at the police station. That's almost twice The legal limit. They're going to argue... They're going to argue that three drinks Wasn't enough to get me there. And you can argue traumatic experience. I was in an accident. That increases the effect of alcohol dramatically. And the battery against the officer? No mention of that in the police report. Now, these police cars-- They've got their video cameras right on the dash. Those recordings are kept for up to six days. Subpoena those recordings before they can erase them. And get that dispatch tape. Ten to one my name is on it. Yeah, they knew it was my car. They couldn't wait to arrest me. Let the plotting begin. You know, there's something Refreshingly honest about the borgias Murdering their enemies. Here, we just plot No confidence votes. Here it is. Look. Thought we were studying martin luther king. You were studying martin luther king. See, there's your mother. I don't get it. It's a web site where you bet on stuff. You know, celebrity stuff like, uh, You know, "which disney star will die first?" Stuff like that. So, they're betting on my mom? If she'll get a divorce. That's... Awful. (laughs) So, what should I bet? You want to know if they're going to get a divorce? Yeah. It's like having insider information. It's like having somebody inside exxon. See, after this whole threesome thing, Betting is moving 75% for divorce. And I've got 50 bucks, so...? She's not going to divorce. You're sure? I'm sure. (typing) So, did your dad really ask your mom for a threesome? No. But they wouldn't tell you if he did, right? Did you hear what she said on howard stern? Who? Your dad's hooker. She said they had s*x in your bed. She did not. Yeah, she did. That's what somebody in chemistry said. So, just think about it. Right here. This bed. It's pretty cool. It wasn't the same one. I had a different bed. What are you, like 14? Yeah. Well, I'm 16. Jackie: I'm back, kids. Hello! I... I got to help my grandma. I'm sorry. Let me give you something, zachary. Just, you know, in case your parents Are giving you any trouble, bothering you, And you want something-- Some space, a car. Just, um... Play this. What is it, rap? (laughing) No, it's better. It makes parents give you whatever you want. You need a little rebellion in your life. It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick. I'm rebecca. Zachary and I were just studying. Bye. Video from the dashboard camera. Thanks. Good or bad? You should watch. So, Stern still treating you like a puppet? Here's my script. (knocking) Alicia, it's... Who? Amber madison. She says she... Has a question for you. Take a message. Why is she phoning you? I don't know. She's trying to cause a scene. I don't know-- for attention. You want me to talk to her? Talk to her? Mm. Wh-what would that entail? Talk. I'm fine. Thank you. Contact me if that changes. O-... Okay. Damn it. You need to calm down. Don't make me put the cuffs back on you. I said let me go, damn it! Why did we subpoena this again? Don't worry about it. Matan: Is this an accurate depiction Of the events, officer sutton? Yes, it is. Your honor, as you can see, The video is clearly relevant. It may be relevant, but it's unnecessary When they have the officer's testimony, and given... Yes, ms. Florrick? Given the illinois state supreme court... The illinois court's ruling In people v. Harriman,  We believe... Judge: Harriman was one of your cases, Wasn't it, mr. Stern? Yes. Yes, your honor, it was. Judge: That case dealt with video from an outside source. This is video from the officer's dashboard. We're arguing that the underlying principle Is the same, your honor. Judge: That might work With the illinois supreme court, but not here. Very good. We'll reconvene after lunch. 
 
 What was that? You're hesitating. I don't have time to be hesitating. You're interrupting. Maybe this was a mistake. They should be out in a minute. They're finishing up pretrial motions. How many clients do you have? Currently? Two. Who pays you? A committee of interested advisors. And how long are they paying you? It's month to month, but I'd imagine until... Actually, I'm not sure how long they'll pay me. "until..."? It's not my business To look into the future, mrs. Florrick. Are there designs to put Peter back in office? Yes. Your husband is missed. He was a very effective state's attorney, And people want him back. (door opening) Peter: It's insane That I would hire a call girl to work on my campaign. Think about it. It's... She was talking about your kids at risk program. (laughs) Yeah, well, and anyone Who read the news would know about that. She's out there. She's out there, and she can say whatever she wants, And there's nothing I can do to stop her, Because the libel laws are against us. She's phoning my work. Who? Your... Prostitute Is calling my work. I told the kids I'd come here, Peter, And talk to you, but I... I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. I don't know what's a lie or what's the truth. I just... I can't take this. Hold on. No. I want it to stop. This is your family. I don't care about libel laws. You make it stop. Make her stop. What are you saying? (door slams shut) (paper rustling) (sighs) Oh... (gasps) (sighs) Judge: Unless there's anything else, I rule that the police dashboard tape Be considered... Your honor. Yes, mrs. Florrick? I have one more thing. No, you don't. We move to disqualify the video On the grounds that it was obtained As the result of an illegal arrest. Your honor, what could possibly be illegal... Mr. Stern, Is it your understanding that the officer... Your honor, I am mr. Stern's legal representative. Yes, ma'am, But I believe mr. Stern has a difference of opinion. Uh, mrs. Florrick and I need five minutes, Your honor. No, we're fine. Officer sutton stated on his dashboard video, "don't make me put the handcuffs back on you"" Implying that he'd been handcuffed previously. Did you, officer sutton? I'd handcuffed him when I found him In the bar because he was belligerent, As you see in the video. But when I brought him outside, I took the cuffs off so I could perform a sobriety test. Was mr. Stern armed? No. Did you fear for your life? No, but, I... Then it was an arrest, your honor. Mr. Stern was not free to go. And officer sutton had no probable cause-- The mere fact that it was an accident Does not mean a crime was committed. So, everything that follows is tainted-- The sobriety tests, the video. Your honor, the video captures The commission of a subsequent crime-- A battery of a police officer. Yeah, yeah, but it's exactly... Mr. Stern, please sit down. Except that it occurred during the sobriety tests. And if the sobriety tests Are disqualified, The video must be disqualified. Motion granted. The video is hereby excluded. We're adjourned until tomorrow. Well, well, The best arguments really do sound spontaneous. Mr. Stern, You cannot backseat drive your own defense. You chose me to represent you. If that is what you want, I'm your lawyer. You're my client. Let's go. I, uh... I think you should take the kids to church more. Because...? Zach's listening to muslim music. No, I'm serious. His girlfriend is muslim. Zach's girlfriend? Yes. Zach has a girlfriend? Yes. They-they were here yesterday In his room, and they were playing that music. And where were you? I was out getting groceries. (knocking on door) You have a girlfriend? No. Who was here yesterday? Becca. And becca isn't your girlfriend? Uh, she's a friend who's a girl. And you were in here working together? Yeah. She's helping me out with social studies. Grace: She's a junior! Shut up! No one asked you! Don't say "shut up." She was helping a freshman? I'm... Mom, she's nice. You'd like her. Oh, I'm sure I would. And she is welcome to study here anytime, But only when jackie is here, And only in the living room. But the computer's in here. Yeah. Wait, mom. Mom, what are you doing? Here. Carry this. Come on. Mom, this is ridiculous. (sighs) Lots of light. Lots of room. This is... Mom, I want my privacy. And you'll have that when you're 18. This is... Nothing happened. Good. Would you like my desk lamp? You don't trust me. Zach, you're 14 years old. You are a freshman in high school. You had a junior in your room yesterday With the door closed. This is what is called parenting, that's all. Now, go get the rest of your stuff. No. You trusted dad. Now you think I'm going to be the same. Zach, I love you. I love you so much. But the computer stays here. (door slamming) (islamic call to prayer playing over stereo) How long Did you stay at the cocktail party, mr. Tolliver? About two hours. I left around 10:00 p.M., Just after mr. Stern left. Matan: And can you tell us what you witnessed in that time? Well, I saw mr. Stern consume at least six drinks. Matan: Six? What kind of drinks? Are we talking white wine spritzers here? Scotch. Neat. Tolliver is an investment banker, Works for tolin & howard. Have you ever had any fights with tolin & howard? Mm-mm. The problem is, One time or another, I've pissed off practically everyone. Tolliver. Tolliver industries. It's a family run business. I sued them for civil rights violations. Brenda! Get me the file on tolliver industries. Brenda: Got it. Tibetan ginseng. Energy. Jonas, I checked on your case work. The files weren't there. What do you mean they weren't there? Why? A cary agos signed them out, On will gardner's authorization. What the hell are you doing? Sneaking around my files? Looking for little slipups? It's an issue of firm liability, jonas. Somebody has to stay on top of these things. Oh, come on, will. What? You certainly don't seem inclined to do it. You know, you talk a good game about liability, But we both know this is about control. Jonas votes with me 90% of the time. You push him out... Enough! My god. You call yourselves lawyers? I was winning cases When you were in little league. And you, my protégé. The only reason I hired you Is because it looked good to have a woman in the office. The both of you treat the practice of law Like it's used cars! Well, you try to get rid of me, It'll cost you every cent of your golden parachute, And that is after the lawsuit! I will bankrupt this firm Before I let you Push me out. I suppose you heard that tirade back there. I imagine the people on lakeshore drive heard it, too. We'd better go in. Did you find anything on tolliver? Yeah... Yes, tolliver industries. Right. Tolliver industries. I sued them once. Civil rights violations. We should use that. (door opening) Miss madison, I'm daniel golden. We, uh, spoke on the phone. You look good, Peter. I always liked you in a suit. Golden: We have issues That we have to deal with-- This book and your appearances. Yes, still a lot of pillow talk to talk about. You phoned my wife. That's always what it comes down to. Men and their wives. I'd like To talk to Peter alone. No. You have an offer? Stop writing the book, Stop doing interviews, Spreading stories about my client. How much? You recognize this man? Prior to your... (clears throat) Relationship with my client, You had a similar relationship with him. Peter? The fbi believe that he's responsible For ordering the 24th ward murders And three other slayings. He owns a car dealership. He's a businessman. And I don't think He will look kindly on your book Touching on his business. My book doesn't touch on his business. Unfortunately, he doesn't know that. He also doesn't know about certain personal things That you mentioned to my client about him. That was between us. And it'll stay between you. Peter... You wouldn't. You phone my wife. You threaten my family. You go on a talk show, Humiliate, And slander my wife and children. To protect my family, You have no idea what I'm capable of. (door opens) (door closes) (knocking) Yeah? I need more help. It's what I live for. (camera shutter clicks) Donepezil. That's the name of the medicine you're taking. That's why you crashed. You didn't drink at the party, and the roads weren't wet. What are you talking about? I saw them, mr. Stern. They're not energy pills. Peter's father had dementia, Not alzheimer's. His was vascular. I know what it looks like. The forgetfulness, the anger, Mood swings. I know how terrible... You know nothing. Jonas stern does not have dementia. Mr. Stern, you're facing jail time. I know that. Your condition is your defense. This isn't a dui. There is no condition! I'll be damned if I'm gonna have people think That jonas stern is losing his mind! There are three people who know what you know. One is my doctor, the second one is me, And the third is now covered by attorney-client privilege. And as your client, I am ordering you Not to breathe a word of this. Not in my defense, not to anyone. Do you understand? Do you understand? I understand. Stern gets into an accident, not because he's drunk, But because he's confused. He doesn't want to admit it, so he goes and has four drinks-- Trying to make it look like he's covering up a dui. So what does the cop do? Sobriety tests. Which he fails, because now he's had a few, Or he's shaken up. Or... What? The question isn't what did the cop do. It's what didn't the cop do. Alicia... Where's stern? He's meeting me at court. Why? We went through his casework. Everything was great until a year ago, And he started missing filing deadlines. Luckily, they weren't important, But we could be vulnerable here. I'm not asking you to divulge any privileged communique. Good. But I need to know where his head's at. Unless that blowup was his final word on the subject. Look, all I want is for you to look after his best interests. The firm's best interests. The firm assigned me to represent him, will. With all the confidentiality that entails, I can't... Say anymore. (door slamming) You gave 'em to mom. What? Get out of here! The pictures of dad-- you gave 'em to mom. I didn't give anything to mom. Well, they're gone. Grandma. Why...? How do you know that? Zach, she goes through my room when I'm at school. She throws away stuff she doesn't like, like Candy and clothes. She doesn't ever do it to you 'cause you're the good boy. I hate this. Yeah. When did you start paying attention? Alicia: Officer, what sobriety tests did you perform on mr. Stern? Objection. Officer sutton has already testified in detail About the tests he performed. Yes, your honor, But I'm more interested in the one he didn't perform. Okay. Let's see where this is going. I see no record Of you performing a preliminary breathalyzer test on mr. Stern At the scene, officer. I don't always do that, ma'am. These are reports from your last 37 duis. You performed preliminary breathalyzers on... Would you like to guess How many? Thirty-seven. Judge romano : Officer sutton. Your honor, it's perfectly innocent. I voided the test results Because the machine was malfunctioning. It showed mr. Stern's blood alcohol level was .03, But I could see he was drunk, he was stumbling around... So you neglected to put it in the police report? It wasn't accurate. We got back to the station-- he blew a .15. An hour later, After the drinks from the bar Fully kicked in... Your honor? Mr. Brody, I'm dismissing the dui. And unless you want me to dismiss the battery And levy sanctions, You'd better come up with something fast. Misdemeanor assault. Six months probation. Ask her. Misdemeanor assault? Six months probation? Time served? You must be pretty pleased with yourself. You shouldn't be driving, mr. Stern. And unless you disclose your condition, You shouldn't be practicing law, either. What are you... Th-the partners meeting isn't until 5:00 Call it off. I'm not fighting you, diane. I'm leaving. Last thing I need is to waste time and energy here Fighting with people I love. And I do. That thing I said earlier-- I'm sorry. It wasn't true. I know. I was the best lawyer you had at that firm. Yeah. I have to admit, I never thought I'd see the day Jonas stern retired. Who said anything about retiring? I'm leaving to start a new firm. What? You know, last year, you billed Over $50 million between gentech financials And parthenon systems alone. Now, they're my clients, And I'm taking them with me. Jonas, you take our clients, You forfeit your golden parachute. My clients. And that's not all. I'm gonna take a third of your business.
