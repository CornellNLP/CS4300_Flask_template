 Good job, Alicia. 
 Will: Thanks for going all out this year. 
 It's been quite a ride. 
 Diane: And we're not out of the woods yet. 
 We have a lot of trimming to do. 
 So we're all going to have to work harder. 
 Will: Do more with less. 
 I'm ready. 
 Diane: We know you are. 
 You okay? 
 Yes. 
 Don't worry, everything's going to be fine. 
 Cary, do you have a minute? 
 Yes. 
 You're safe. 
 I'm safe? 
 Pink slips are going out. 
 There's gonna be a lot of blood in these halls in about an hour. 
 They fired him. 
 They kept you? 
 I got a client last minute through Peter. 
 Smart. 
 No. 
 You got a client. 
 Cary would have done the same thing if he had that opportunity. 
 Kalinda, don't. 
 Do you have your keys? 
 My...? 
 Your car keys. 
 Do you have them? 
 Why? 
 I just want to compare them. 
 Are you trying to distract me? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, Kalinda? 
 What are you doing? 
 You won, he lost. 
 So you're going to turn this into some morbid thing because that's who you are. 
 So, let's go. 
 Let me get my bag. 
 (Loud music plays) Kalinda: It's a Lockhart/Gardner tradition. 
 Now you're an associate... two shots of Tequila. 
 ♪ yo! You see me burnin' up ♪ 
♪ body hot to the touch, come on! ♪ 
 ♪ partying at the club ♪ 
♪ yo, deejay, turn it up... ♪ 
 (sighs) 
 Oh. 
 I have to be home by 8:00. 
 Let me see your phone. 
 No, Kalinda, really, I have to get home. 
 Alicia, I'm taking responsibility for your irresponsibility. 
 Let me see your phone. 
 ♪...At every occasion, big boy ain't a star ♪ 
♪ I'm a constellation ♪ Hmm... 
 ♪ keep your hands up, that's my occupation, so I just need... ♪ 
 Hi. Uh, who am I speaking to? 
 Zach. This is Kalinda. 
 Sure. One second. 
 Hey, dad, mom's going to be working late again tonight. 
 (Doorbell ringing) 
 Tell her not to worry. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, that's fine. Thanks. 
 You don't look like a man who's going to be free in a few days. 
 There's been a hitch. 
 Hmm? 
 Look, I really miss Daniel Golden. 
 Well, when the Obama white house calls, you got to go. 
 Golden said she's the better litigator. 
 (Computer chirping) It's just easy to underestimate her. 
 Well, she must be very, very good, because I'm greatly underestimating her. 
 (Computer chirps) (Grunts) 
 Ms. Tascioni, hi. 
 Eli Gold. 
 Oh, yes. Hello. 
 You're not good with computers, are you? 
 My son keeps buying me new ones and then just backing away... and laughing. 
 (Chuckles) 
 So what are we watching? 
 Evidence. 
 For the retrial? 
 Yep. (Computer chirps) 
 But the prosecution lost its only witness, right? 
 Kozko committed suicide, so they don't have a case. 
 And I thought Monday would be a simple matter of a dismissal, but watch. 
 (Computer chirps) 
 (Groans) 
 (Computer chirps) 
 (Computer beeps) Glenn: Prosecution interview b-3:  People v. Peter Florrick. 
 Peter was pretty bald about it. 
 Uh, $45,000 would buy you a certain amount of access. 
 $85,000... more. 
 Glenn: Did he say what he needed the money for? 
 Kozko: A down payment on a bigger house. 
 This is a video proffer completed by Mr. Kozko before his death. 
 The prosecution now plans to introduce it into evidence. 
 But they can't, because it's hearsay. 
 That's right. 
 And they don't want to use it. 
 They want the press to use it. 
 Well, that was my first guess, but these aren't the motions of a prosecution winding down. 
 Kozko: Peter promised me an ear, and he also promised me his friendship. 
 (Dance music plays) 
 Man: Come on, everybody, join the happy couple on the dance floor. 
 Let go... 
 No. 
 (Both laughing) 
 You know, will feels the same way about you. 
 No, he doesn't. 
 And even if he did, it doesn't matter. 
 It does. 
 I phone will, I tell him we're in a bar and that you're too drunk to go home. 
 So you're getting a hotel room upstairs. 
 Alicia, one night... no repercussions. 
 And tomorrow? 
 Tomorrow you wake up. 
 (Chuckles) 
 That's just not me, Kalinda. 
 Everything is you. 
 Everything you want to be you is you. 
 You two are so hot. 
 (Both laughing) 
 And, um... you... you are? 
 Brian. I'm the best man. 
 What are you celebrating? 
 Tomorrow her husband is being freed from house arrest. 
 Really? 
 All right, uh, well, I'm getting you both drinks. 
 Yeah. 
 (Snickering) 
 Are you gay? 
 Oh, come on. 
 We are talking about every single little detail of my life. 
 It's a simple question. 
 I'm... 
 I'm private. 
 Ugh. Come on. 
 What does it matter? 
 It doesn't. 
 Then why'd you want to know? 
 Because I do. 
 And how is this fair? 
 I talk about everything. 
 I didn't say it was. 
 You like to talk about your life. 
 I don't like to talk about mine. 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 It's work. 
 Hi. It's me. 
 Yes. I know. Hi. 
 How you doing? 
 Good, actually. 
 Really good. 
 I'm glad. You deserve it. 
 Um, how about you? 
 Well, we're in the midst of layoffs. 
 Oh, God. I'm so sorry. 
 No, no. It just has to be done. 
 Alicia, I... 
 You...? 
 I, um... 
 Can I ask you a favor? 
 I just got a call from a client who needs help, but I can't get away right now. 
 Oh, um, yeah, of course. 
 Which client? 
 Colin Sweeney. 
 I know. Look, it'll be easy. 
 We just revamp the language on his company merger. 
 I'm sure he just wants to ask a few questions before he signs. 
 I was gonna send Brad, but we just let him go. 
 Oh, God. No, of course. 
 Um, it's... it's close to here. 
 Thanks. 
 Don't leave without a fully-executed copy, okay? 
 This merger is very important to the firm. 
 (Sighs) 
 Thanks. 
 I'm really glad this worked out. 
 Yeah. Me, too. Bye. 
 Just give me a minute. 
 (Doorbell chimes) 
 Sweeney (Over intercom): Yes. Who's there? 
 Mr. Sweeney, it's Alicia Florrick. 
 Will Gardner sent me. 
 Uh... (Laughs) 
 Uh, sure, come on up. 
 (Buzzer sounds) 
 (Door bangs shut) 
 Mr. Sweeney? 
 Mr. Sweeney? 
 Sweeney: Uh, in the study. 
 Uh, could you grab the camera on the table, please, dear? 
 I have a cab waiting, Mr. Sweeney. 
 Will Gardner said you'd have a... 
 Red-lined contract waiting for me. 
 I can explain. 
 Sweeney: This... this is not what it looks like. 
 Oh, oh, yeah, the camera. Yes. 
 Um, I... could you? 
 I can't reach. 
 I already phoned 911 a minute ago. 
 Is she dead? 
 Sheila? Yeah. 
 It was self-defense. 
 You have to believe that. 
 She attacked me. 
 Uh, sorry. I just... 
 Mr. Sweeney, stop! 
 Kalinda, there's been... 
 I need your help at Colin Sweeney's. 
 There's been a murder. 
 No. I don't know. 
 Um, I didn't know it was a crime scene, and my fingerprints are on... Mr. Sweeney, don't! 
 They were just so embarrassing. 
 The pictures. Put the camera down. 
 As soon as you can. Thanks. 
 Don't move! 
 (Clattering) 
 Hello? 
 What's wrong? 
 Is someone else here? 
 No. Why? 
 (Distant siren wailing) 
 Sweeney: Here comes the cavalry! 
 (Siren approaching) 
 He never hurt anyone. 
 Chili... he barely even barked. 
 So you're saying she killed your dog? 
 Even though the victim has no defensive wounds on her body from a canine attack. 
 Mr. Sweeney is choosing not to answer at this time, Detective. 
 Mrs. Florrick, you said that your fingerprints were on, uh... 
 On the doorbell, on the entering doorknob, on the banister... on the camera. 
 He opened the back of the camera? 
 I can't answer that, due to attorney-client privilege. 
 But your fingerprints are on the camera? 
 Yes, as I said. 
 So you're still insisting that you didn't tamper with evidence? 
 Yes. 
 Even though I smell alcohol on your breath? 
 Tony... 
 This is my job, Ms. Sharma. 
 I don't interfere with your job. 
 We were celebrating when I received a phone call from Mr. Sweeney. 
 Excuse me. From Mr. Gardner... a partner at my firm. 
 He told me to come here to collect contracts. 
 I arrived by cab. 
 I did not drive myself. 
 You're under arrest for murder, Mr. Sweeney. 
 Back in the cuffs I go. 
 Listen to me, Mr. Sweeney. 
 Remain silent. 
 Irony does not work here. 
 Jokes don't work. 
 Do you understand? 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
 Bailiff: All rise! 
 The Honorable Graham Schickel presiding. 
 Schickel: Good morning. 
 As the youngest justice on the bench in the state of Illinois, I would like to say welcome. 
 And I believe you have a motion, Mr. state's attorney? 
 I do, Your Honor. 
 We move to introduce into evidence the video proffer made by our key witness Gerald Kozko, recently deceased. 
 Yes, Your Honor. Hi. 
 Um, I hate to object right off the bat here, but, uh, the key word here is "deceased" 
 Mr. Florrick has a right to challenge his accuser. 
 I can't cross-examine a dead witness, as much as I'd like to try. 
 Glenn: Uh, Your Honor, two years ago, Illinois legislature, in a 109-to-0 vote, passed the Peterson law, which makes us the only state in the union which allows hearsay evidence- such as this proffer... when the accused benefits from the death. 
 Ah, getting novel on us, Mr. Childs. 
 This law is almost as new as I am. 
 (Chuckles) Yes, Your Honor, but unfortunately for Mr. Childs, the Peterson law requires the accused benefit not just from a death, but from a murder he committed. 
 And Mr. Kozko committed suicide. 
 The police have not made that determination, Your Honor. 
 No body has been found yet, and we will present evidence to the contrary. 
 (Laughs) 
 My apologies, Your Honor. 
 I'm sorry. I found that humorous. 
 Mr. Childs would like to prove my client is a murderer, so he can prosecute him for corruption? 
 Well, that is certainly novel. 
 Well, novel or not, we will hear evidence on this alleged murder tomorrow. 
 (Gavel raps) 
 (Indistinct conversation) 
 Guys in the Bureau might want to keep track of Mr. Florrick... 
 Yes, he's talking with the feds. 
 I think things just got more serious. 
 Coordinating strategy? 
 I don't know. 
 (Glenn speaking indistinctly) 
 Hi. Are you two coordinating strategy? 
 Mr. Childs and I are old friends. 
 (Sighs) What a relief. 
 Sweeney: She would ambush me. 
 I'd fight. 
 And if I won, we'd have s*x. 
 Diane: She was your stalker, but you encouraged her? 
 It was a game. 
 She'd break in, I would disarm her, we'd have s*x. 
 It was terrific. 
 This time, it was different. 
 This time, she tried to kill me. 
 The police are calling the victim a Jane Doe. 
 Do you have any idea who she was? 
 No. I just knew her as Sheila Penn. 
 You said she wrote you? 
 Yes, classic stalker letters. 
 Where are they? 
 In his bedside table, which means the police already have it. 
 Let's petition the court for access to these letters. 
 When do we get forensics, blood work? 
 Alicia: Preliminary, three days. 
 We should get an expedited necropsy on the dog. I think that's a cul-de-sac. 
 Preliminary M.E. report shows no defensive wounds on the victim from a canine attack. 
 Yes, but Sweeney said he heard no barking at all when the Jane Doe broke in. 
 So maybe the attacker sedated the dog first. 
 That would show up in a necropsy. 
 And if we can prove Jane Doe sedated the dog, it's premeditation; she went there with the purpose of doing harm. 
 Good, it's a place to start. 
 Get the letters and get the dog. 
 Alicia, do you have a second? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't know. I thought it was contracts. 
 I never would've sent you there. 
 Will, really, it's fine. 
 How are you handling it? 
 The body, the blood. 
 Oh. 
 Good. 
 I didn't really think about it. 
 (Laughs) 
 What a weird life we lead, huh? 
 So, are we normal again, are we dealing with it? 
 We talking about the crime scene now? 
 No. 
 Yes, we're dealing with it. 
 Well, welcome back. 
 Talk about the luck of job. 
 On the brink of merging Sweeney's company with another one, this happens. The merger's not off-track yet. 
 I'm phoning to check everybody's temperature. 
 The CEO was just accused of murder. 
 Everybody'll scramble. 
 Not necessarily. The buyer's motivated, and money is money. 
 What's that about? 
 Oh, the layoffs. 
 Yes. Won't be a fun day. 
 Cary... 
 I'm just getting my laptop. 
 I just wanted to say I'm sorry. 
 Sorry you got the job, or sorry for what you did to get the job? 
 Sorry we both didn't get the job. 
 Alicia, here's the thing... you like to think you're a good person, and maybe at one time you were, but we both know you'll do whatever it takes. 
 Sleeping with the boss? 
 Check. 
 Cary, if it makes you feel better to think that, then think it, but... 
 I don't have a name, Alicia, I don't have a fairy godmother I can phone up or the whole Chicago political machine. 
 I had to work, I had to sweat, I had to make money for this firm, and that's just not enough. 
 Sir, you have to leave. 
 I need my laptop and my personal items. 
 You can itemize them, and they will be collected and sent to your home. 
 I need them now. 
 That's not possible, sir. 
 They'll be returned to you within three working days. 
 (Quietly): This was not fair. 
 And I was stupid... I acted like it would be. 
 Alicia: So, these letters were sent to Sweeney? 
 Kalinda: Yeah. Sweeney's at least telling the truth about being stalked. 
 "You're dead meat, my darling. 
 I feast on dead meat." 
 Is she still a Jane Doe? 
 Yep. 
 What? 
 You know what's odd? 
 These letters are filled with details from his trial. 
 Alicia: A juror? 
 Kalinda: It's the legal language she uses. 
 "I want to kill that idiot deponent." 
 "I hate the rule 30 slut." 
 It's like someone in the business. 
 Kalinda: These are from the first trial. 
 Who's this? 
 Court reporter. 
 Yeah. 
 That could be her. 
 Yeah. 
 What's her name? 
 Burton, get ready to write down an address. 
 Not to sound too melodramatic, Your Honor, but objection. Really. 
 Your Honor, Mrs. Kozko heard directly from her husband that if he were to die under mysterious circumstances that it would be at Peter Florrick's hand. 
 Yes, and I heard from a butterfly it wouldn't be. 
 Both are hearsay statements, Your Honor, and equally inadmissible. 
 The Peterson law allows for exactly such hearsay testimony. 
 So let me get this straight... it allows for hearsay as long as a murder is established. 
 And a murder is established here because there's a hearsay statement that establishes it... 
 I mean, tell me when the snake actually devours its tail, okay? 
 Ms. Tascioni, you're ridiculing established Illinois law. 
 Yes, Your Honor, gleefully. 
 Well, I know I'm the, uh, youngest judge on the bench, but... 
 Yes, Your Honor, we're all in awe. 
 But I will overrule your objection. 
 Given the Peterson law, this testimony is allowed. 
 If you have a problem with that, you can take it up with the supreme court. 
 Okay. Now I get to work. 
 Hybristophiliac. 
 Women who are irresistibly attracted to dangerous men. 
 It's quite common. 
 Women who propose to Charlie Manson or send their panties to Jeffrey Dahmer. 
 45 years. 
 No. 
 See you in court. 
 Fine. This isn't gangbanger number five, Ms. Lockhart; this is Colin Sweeney. 
 People want him behind bars. 
 Then people should find better evidence, because this screams self-defense, ma'am. 
 The thing is... these letters didn't just go one way. 
 How's Peter doing? 
 Fine... thank you. 
 Julius: Where'd you get these? 
 The victim's house. 
 You see, Mr. Sweeney wrote back, encouraging her, taunting her. 
 I'm sure you can find a psychological term for that, too. 
 Hysterical prosecution? 
 45 years. 
 Here is a copy of the victim's diary with some very interesting entries on your client, and some quite specific descriptions of their sexual practices. 
 So, this is you? 
 This is me? 
 Milking it? 
 The wife of Peter Florrick representing a killer. 
 Interesting. 
 I hadn't considered that. 
 Well, what about this? 
 The state's attorney hired a sick, killer-obsessed court reporter for some of the state's most high-profile criminal cases. 
 Now that will be a fun lawsuit. 
 Well, you got me there, Mrs. Florrick. 
 So, let's try this. 
 Why don't we both just do our jobs? 
 (Scoffs) Of course I wrote back. 
 I love a good fetish. 
 Cut the crap, Mr. Sweeney. 
 You're looking at 45 years. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Please take a look at the diary, Mr. Sweeney. 
 (Sighs) 
 Sheila... Warburg? 
 My God, how prosaic. 
 Sweaty suburban s*x with Sheila Warburg. 
 Julius: We need to figure out what's true and what she made up. 
 Well, this is not true. 
 This one here. 
 I'm not opposed to it in principle. 
 (Laughing): But my goodness. 
 Diane: If you could underline the parts that are fiction? 
 Certainly. 
 Look... 
 I had s*x with her twice. 
 She liked to pretend to break in and handcuff me. 
 We would wrestle, then we'd have s*x. 
 But this time, she wouldn't stop. 
 I tried to get her to drop the knife, but... then we... we struggled, an... and... and the knife... 
 It went in. 
 That's it. 
 Okay, we'll get back to you. 
 Right. I have to go. Give me a few hours. 
 
 
 
 (Sighs) 
 Julius! 
 The merger's on. 
 If anything, Mr. Sweeney's troubles have shored up the buyer's interest. 
 They were scared of his volatility. 
 Meaning? 
 Well, we're not changing our defense strategy, but... 
 It would benefit us if Mr. Sweeney took a plea? 
 Okay, we can't say that, but I'm backing away from Mr. Sweeney's defense. 
 A Chinese wall. 
 You and Alicia continue, and we'll say no more. 
 Make any deal you can, defend him any way you can. 
 We won't talk to you, you won't talk to us. Okay? 
 Got it. 
 (Door opens and closes) 
 Are you dancing a jig inside? 
 Like rose on the Titanic. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Sighs) 
 Man: Cary Agos! 
 Marty. 
 You work here? 
 Uh, no. 
 Trying to. I thought you were at Lockhart/Gardner. 
 Yeah. I was. Layoffs. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Same at Orren & Polk. 
 And I wouldn't even go in here. 
 They're just lining up resumes for 2011. 
 Come on, let's go get a drink. 
 Ah, maybe I'll give it a try. 
 You don't believe me? 
 Well, go for it. 
 Hey, did you hear about Corsican? 
 Harvard Review, clerked for Scalia. 
 Now he's writing a screenplay. 
 About what? 
 (Laughs): Who cares? 
 Hey, so, if you change your mind, some of the old buds are getting together at Brandos, all right? Drop by. 
 Okay, get them to his desk today, and I will meet you there. 
 The FBI doesn't give you much space, does it? 
 This is the size of my old college dorm room. 
 Were you visiting someone else in the building, Mr. Gold? 
 I was, but I thought I'd make a little detour. 
 I can't talk about any ongoing investigations. 
 Oh, I didn't think you could. 
 I thought I'd talk about 'em. 
 Oh, knock yourself out. 
 Glenn Childs has it out for my client. 
 It is a politically-motivated prosecution, and the FBI should not be in the business of taking sides. 
 You are reading too much into my visit with Mr. Childs. 
 He is giving you evidence against Florrick. 
 He is suggesting that Florrick is responsible for Kozko's death. 
 And you're buying it. 
 Well, you know your secret investigation of my client... it's no longer a secret. 
 I've seen this. 
 I know you have, but you haven't seen it on the side of a bus. 
 And I had it made into buttons. 
 One for each of the reporters visiting the court. 
 And... coffee mugs. 
 And this... is a little mouse pad, just for you. 
 You think this will scare us, Mr. Gold? 
 The office that took down Capone? 
 Really? 
 Oh, I know how the FBI works... ma'am. 
 You don't like to hunt for new game. 
 You'd rather take down an already bleeding deer, because you want to look good for your superiors. 
 Well, this is just to say that we are not bleeding. 
 We have a lot of fight left in us yet. 
 So go find some new game. 
 Kalinda: We need to talk. 
 That doesn't sound good. 
 It's Sweeney. When is it ever good? 
 I got the results of the dog necropsy. 
 No drugs in chili? 
 That's not all. 
 There was blood on the dog's fur from the victim. 
 Makes sense. 
 Blood when she broke in. 
 No, she didn't cut herself from breaking in. 
 It's from the struggle. 
 It... it can't be. 
 She wasn't alive after the struggle. 
 Right. 
 And there was also blood from Sweeney. And these. 
 Hesitation knife wounds, with a tentative angling of the knife. 
 Someone hesitated before they killed the dog? 
 Yep. 
 The dog's owner? 
 Hardest thing I've ever done. 
 He was so innocent. 
 You did it? 
 You actually killed your dog? 
 (Sniffling) 
 Who was going to believe me? 
 Not a soul. You don't. 
 I panicked. 
 I... I thought if the police saw she killed my dog, they'd see... 
 Julius: Mr. Sweeney, we're gonna have to talk about taking a plea. 
 Maybe we can talk them down to 30 years. 
 (Scoffs) 
 I didn't do this. 
 Alicia: Just stop it. 
 Mr. Sweeney, stop it. You killed your dog. 
 Yeah, but this lady tried to kill me. 
 I was protecting myself. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Julius: We'll try to make the best deal we can, Mr. Sweeney. 
 Marty: You used to drop the H-bomb, people would look up, put your resume on the top. 
 Now everybody's, "ah, so what? Harvard grad" 
 Hey, look... Justice Hart. 
 Marty: No, he's already staffed up. 
 Cary: So you guys just drink here, trying to get a job? 
 You make it sound so sad. 
 We're absorbing legal culture. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Glenn Childs, six o'clock. 
 Marty: Hu-huh. Right. 
 When I want to make a first-year teacher's salary. 
 Well, they're not hiring, anyway. 
 So, Cary, you're the last one working. 
 What's your severance? 
 My severance? I don't know. 
 Oh, you'll find out. 
 Last one working pays. 
 All right. 
 (Slow jazz playing) 
 Have you read outliers by Malcolm Gladwell? 
 Excuse me? 
 The book. 
 Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. 
 Okay. 
 It says the Beatles are the Beatles because they played 10,000 hours in a German strip club. 
 Bill Gates is Bill Gates because he worked 10,000 hours in an after-school computer lab. 
 What do you want, Mr. Childs? 
 To give you the chance to work 10,000 hours prosecuting the worst scum in Chicago. 
 I know who you are, Cary. 
 I know you're responsible for some of our worst defeats. 
 And I also know that you were under-appreciated and undervalued at Lockhart/Gardner. 
 I want you to join us, I want you to... 
 Yes. 
 I'll need your help with Alicia Florrick. 
 She and her husband... 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Thanks. 
 Here we go. I think I hold control, shift and D. 
 (Computer chimes) No. F. 
 No. Actually, Ms. Tascioni, I... I am a little busy. 
 I have a client. 
 Yes, the problem is, I lack confidence with computers. 
 Can we... do this another time? 
 Did you know Mrs. Kozko has three children? 
 Anthony, Lisa and Arthur. 
 I didn't. 
 Anthony is the oldest, Lisa's the middle child, and... 
 (Computer chimes) Darn! 
 Control, C? 
 (Computer chimes) Arthur is the youngest? 
 Yes. Arthur is the youngest. 
 Well, Mr. and Mrs. Kozko placed $45,000 in all of their accounts for college. 
 (Whispers): Mr. Gold? 
 Very nice gesture. Okay. 
 And this money was not to be touched until they graduated from high school. 
 Well, Anthony already graduated from college, so he spent his. 
 And Lisa is in college now, so she's halfway through her spending. 
 And Arthur... 
 Arthur didn't start spending his college money until this year. 
 Two weeks ago, to be specific. 
 Okay. 
 Well, the funny thing is, Arthur isn't in college. 
 In fact, Arthur was a stillborn birth in 1992. 
 Now, that is funny. 
 Yes. 
 And that got me thinking... who is withdrawing all this money from his bank account? 
 And where is it withdrawn? 
 Funny you should ask. 
 STL Bank and Trust in Savannah. 
 Georgia? 
 No. Did you know there's another Savannah, in the Cayman Islands? 
 I did not know that. 
 It's interesting, isn't it? 
 So how are you ahead of the police on this? 
 They're not looking. 
 You seem to be down one partner today. 
 And I'm wearing a different tie. 
 What's that matter? 
 We want involuntary manslaughter, five years. 
 With for-day time off? 
 That's three years for a brutal sexual homicide. 
 Second degree, 15 years, and we're putting a 24-hour clock on it. 
 Offer expires tomorrow. 
 We have proof that Sweeney was stalked. 
 Can we at least stipulate the victim stalked him? 
 Agreed, he was stalked. So? 
 Alicia: There are stalker statutes on the books... statutes that my husband instituted when he was in office. 
 And your point, Mrs. Florrick? 
 Talk to your boss. 
 What sort of message would he be sending to stalking victims if Sweeney's prosecuted? 
 Are you really trying a blame-the-victim defense with Colin Sweeney? 
 Offer him ten years, and we don't have to go to trial. 
 Then let me talk to my boss. 
 (Clears throat) 
 Where is Diane? 
 Chinese wall. 
 Criminal and acquisitions. 
 The merger? 
 Yes. It's my guess, it's probably more lucrative if Sweeney's out of the picture. 
 If Sweeney takes a plea, he can be removed as CEO. 
 Does Sweeney know about this? 
 He knows that we represent his criminal and financial interests. 
 Yes. 
 Feighen Ladsloe. 
 The murderer? 
 Mm-hmm. On death row. 
 Sheila corresponded with him. 
 Before Sweeney? 
 You know, I thought I recognized those entries in her diary. 
 The ones Sweeney said were fiction... they were from Feighen's trial. 
 The court reporter? 
 Yeah. I'm checking all of her trials now, see what other killers she corrpoponded with. 
 Where you going? 
 To tell Julius. 
 This could get them down from ten years. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. How's that Chinese wall? 
 Mrs. Florrick, as much I like keeping our working relationship collegial, don't forget, you're a junior associate, and I'm an equity partner. 
 Watch your tone. 
 Yes, sir. I will. 
 I think we should reconsider the plea bargain. 
 Kalinda's found new evidence. 
 What evidence? 
 Sheila Warburg... she stalked other killers. 
 So you think he's innocent? 
 No. 
 I think he's innocent of this. 
 Schickel: I am ready to hear Mrs. 
 Kozko's testimony, Ms. Tascioni. 
 Yes, just one last objection, Your Honor. 
 The Peterson law... as atrocious as it may be... 
 Objection. 
 Sustained. 
 It requires that Mr. Florrick not only profit from a murder, but be the instrument of that murder, correct? 
 Are you asking me, Ms. Tascioni? 
 Um, no, but you can answer if you want to. 
 And you can get to the point. 
 Oh, okay. Well, for Mr. Kozko to be murdered, one key thing is required that we overlooked. 
 And what is that, Ms. Tascioni? 
 That he be dead. 
 (Gallery murmuring) 
 I did it. 
 Um, this is an ATM photo taken a week ago at BCP Bank and Trust in Savannah, Cayman Islands. 
 Your Honor, Mrs. Kozko's hearsay testimony is inadmissible, and Mr. Kozko's video proffer is likewise inadmissible for the very simple reason that Mr. Kozko is still alive. 
 (Gallery murmuring) (Gavel raps) 
 Schickel: Quiet. Quiet, please. 
 It's done. 
 You're free. 
 (Laughs) 
 Kalinda. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 So, your boy is free. 
 My boy? 
 Florrick. He just won. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 So I hear there are some tapes. 
 Oh, there are always some tapes. 
 And I hear that they hurt Childs and Florrick, so neither wanted to use them. 
 Mutually assured destruction. 
 Sounds like a fairy tale. 
 Funny how fairy tales turn out to be true. 
 Here's the thing, Kalinda. 
 This isn't about Childs or Florrick. 
 This is about Childs and Florrick. 
 We're investigating them both, and I just don't want you to get hurt. 
 Thank you for your concern. 
 Hey. 
 I'm your friend here. 
 It's good to know. 
 So you would advise me to take this? 
 It's the best deal we could have made. 
 Eight years, and this is after we started with what I would have said was a... an adamant 45. 
 Sweeney: Mrs. Florrick? 
 It's true. 
 They started with 45 years. 
 And why not court? 
 Julius: Well, it's coming down to perceptions, Mr. Sweeney. 
 We would have filed for a change of venue, but... 
 I'm famous everywhere? 
 Yes. 
 (Cell lock buzzes in distance) 
 They like me here. In prison. 
 I'm like the king of kings. 
 It's not unlike getting the best table at Schwa, actually. 
 Same jockeying for position. 
 We have until 6:00 to take the plea. 
 Okay, thank you, Julius. 
 I... I... I need to talk to Mrs. Florrick for a second. 
 We're, uh, working together. 
 Yes, I understand. 
 I just have a piece of gossip I want to share, please. 
 (Lock buzzes) 
 It's about the merger? 
 Yes. 
 The company means more with me out of the picture? 
 Yes. 
 And... can I get better than eight years? 
 No. 
 And if we go to trial? 
 I don't know. 
 Sheila Warburg has stalked other killers, but I don't know if that's enough to overcome your... 
 Your baggage. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that's... that's what I thought. 
 Well... 
 I did kill my wife. 
 So I guess the universe is having its little joke at my expense. 
 You killed her? 
 (Laughs) 
 (Snorts) 
 Your face. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you for being honest. 
 You're welcome. 
 Well... 
 (Sighs) 
 Off I go. 
 (Door slams) 
 ♪ you feelin' all right? ♪ 
 (applause and cheering) 
 ♪ I'm not feelin' too good, myself ♪ 
♪ well, you feelin' all right? ♪ 
♪ I'm not feelin' too good, myself... ♪ 
 It's over, isn't it? 
 Looks like it. 
 (Peter laughing) 
 Zach's drinking champagne. 
 Zach? 
 It's soda. 
 Do you know all these people? 
 Alicia: Some. 
 Mike, hey! 
 So, what are we gonna do? 
 Well, clean up. 
 No, after that. 
 Oh. I don't know. 
 What do you want to do? 
 Buy a big house? 
 Go to Europe? 
 ♪ I'm not feelin' too good, myself... ♪ 
 He couldn't have done it without you. 
 Oh, that's not true. 
 It is. We women stay in the shadows, we smile, we comfort, we nurse, but we're always there. 
 You are a good woman, Alicia. 
 Peter: Alicia? 
 He needs you. 
 Alicia? 
 I'm not the lawyer. 
 You need to speak to my wife. Hon? 
 This is Michael from the AFL-CIO, and he's looking for a very good Chicago-based law firm. 
 Alicia works for Lockhart & Gardner. 
 She's one of their best lawyers. 
 If I do say so myself. 
 So, why don't you two talk? 
 Hi.
