 Alicia: Simple assault. 
 Man: Six months' detention, Two years' probation, no jail time. (chuckles): You do know it's called bargaining, right? Why am I the only one making concessions? I just gave you an extra year on probation. You're not giving me anything on detention. Because my client doesn't deserve it-- He's a 98-pound wallflower. Who clocked a classmate with an algebra textbook. Because he was being bullied. 19 stitches, a cracked eye socket. So what's someone from stern, lockhart doing in juvenile court, anyway? God's work. One of our big clients; it's his housekeeper's son. Let him plead no contest; three years probation. (scoffs): Come on. I make that deal, I'm looking for a job. No. You have the flexibility to go to zero, Or you would have made a call. So your husband told you all our secrets? Some. Look, my client is a straight-a student. Never had a bad day before, never have a bad day again, Unless you incarcerate him. One year probation, 200 hours community service, And he takes responsibility in open court. No "bully did this, I did that." Thank you. Go and sin no more. We've been watching you. (chuckles) Now, that sounds sinister. I know how you hate praise, diane, So please, forgive us. What you have done for women, Through example, encouragement and perseverance, Is truly unparalleled. Your work on emily's list, Your mentoring of young lawyers, Your shattering of the glass ceiling... I have a feeling we're coming To a very significant "but." Man: No, a small one. But you now have a hard decision to make. And that is? Woman: Diane... We want you to be a judge. No! Yes. Man; we're here as representatives Of the democratic ward and committee chairs, And we would like to slate you for the upcoming election. I-I... I'm startled. Woman: We need more women judges, diane. We need better judges. Right now we have two lifeguards for every swimmer-- Two judges who understand the law For everyone who doesn't-- And we need to maintain that ratio. Well, I hope I'm a lifeguard. That's the reason we're here. And my firm? You'll have to divest, Of course. We don't do the smoke-filled rooms anymore, diane, But we do manage the primary ballot. So if you agree, You'll be the only woman slated, And thus, a shoo-in. That's how I became chief justice. But it means leaving all this behind. I, um... I don't know what to say. Say yes. Can I take a few days? You can take a week. You've done well, diane. Claim your prize. You want terrence to plead guilty? I want him to go home-- the plea is just A formality, thalia, that's all. And it's just a minor misdemeanor. But he'll have a criminal record. That will be expunged When his probation's finished. He's not a criminal. I know. What do you think, terrence? I don't know. Do you think you could go In front of a judge, tell him what you did and apologize for it? I guess. I am sorry. I know. Grace (over phone): Hey, mom, pick up the phone. Hey, mom, pick up the phone. I-it's my daughter. I'll just be a minute. Hi, grace. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's good. So, can shannon come over today? Who's shannon? She's a girl in my class. How old are you? 13. She's 13, too. My mom said I can go. Her mom says it's okay. Alicia: Is it all right with jackie? Yeah, she said it's fine. She just wanted me to ask you first. Okay, then, Uh, just help grandma with any cleanup. Yeah. Oh... Guess what, mom? What? Her dad's in prison, too. I'll see you tonight. (both giggle) Six months' probation, a hundred hours' Community service. You're lucky it's christmastime, mr. Thompson. Defecate again in your neighbor's closet, I won't be so jolly. And who's our next contestant, danny? Terrence ramsay, your honor. Young master Terrence ramsay. Where are his glasses? Oh, he's fine without them. No, just, can I have them? Where's your counselor, young man? Here, your honor. Oh, good! Shall we all gather Around the campfire here, counselor? I understand you've reached a plea agreement, Mr. Richardson? Yes, your honor. Mr. Ramsay Has agreed to plead guilty to simple assault. Is that correct, mr. Ramsay? You're ready to plead guilty? Yes, sir. Mr. Ramsay, you understand That you have the right... Is there a problem, counselor? No, your honor. Does mr. Ramsay Need his glasses to see me? Ms...? Florrick, your honor. Florrick. Wow. Well, we're in for a treat today, aren't we, danny? Some good old Florrick magic. Why don't you take off those glasses And put them in your pocket, son. To the charge Of simple assault, How do you plead, mr. Ramsay? Guilty, your honor. And in your own words, why don't you Tell us what happened? At lunch, reggie said He was gonna beat me up after school. He called me a little bitch. A-and he said he was gonna Break my glasses. He scared me, and I threw my book at him. And the state's recommendation? One year probation and 200 hours of community service. Mm-hmm. (judge sighs loudly) You caused some serious injuries, mr. Ramsay. Broken eye socket, stitches... The other child is recovering quite well, your honor. Break a nose, And your punishment is picking up trash? What's the lesson there? Your honor, I would just like to say-- The agreement that you have, Mr. Ramsay, is between you and the government, And as such, I am not party to that agreement And can impose a harsher sentence. Do you understand that? Mr. Ramsay... I am sentencing you to nine months' detention. You will receive the guidance you need To become a productive citizen, And come to understand That actions have consequences. No, your honor... This will be the best thing for you, I promise. Your honor, I'm sorry, but we had an agreement: No jail time. (bangs gavel) Next contestant. No, wait! Mom! Terrence? What the hell is going on here? Judge: Young master marcus townsend. Terrence: Mom! Terrence? This where you come to celebrate? Your boss wanted six months. You got nine. Florrick is not the most popular name around here. Oh, that is not what this is about. That was a bait-and-switch. Oh, come on. A judge has indigestion, you get six months; He has a good meal, someone goes free. It balances itself out. Not for terence ramsay. Then what do you want to do? You act like this isn't the water we're both swimming in? Baxter is well-liked, But he's all over the map with sentencing. Someone just complained last week. You think your kid got screwed, Talk to howard brightman at legal aid. Shannon: That's not the entrance. I think that's for the guards. So, how often do you go? To see my dad? Every month. It's far. What's yours? Tamms minimum. So, what'd your dad do? Nothing. I mean, he says he didn't, But they say he sold drugs. Crystal. Wow. That's not bad. So, what did he say happened? He was set up. (laughs) Yeah, my dad, too. I think your dad's prison is nicer than mine. (both laugh, knock at door) Thought I'd make Some snacks for you young ladies. What are we looking at here? Nothing. Thanks, grandma. We're comparing prisons. I don't understand. Shannon's joking. We're fine. Thanks. So, shannon, is your mother picking you up? No. I have my bike. Your bike? Where do you live? Garfield park, on lake. I think I should phone your mother. No. We're fine. Thanks, grandma. We have to do homework now. Bye. So she's the one who took you there? It's like she thinks he's staying at a country club. Not a good one. (laughing): Definitely not. Alicia: Thanks for agreeing to meet, mr. Brightman. Howie. So, do you always Put out a buffet like that? Oh, would you like something? A muffin or something? No, no. I'm fine. So, yeah, um... You're interested in my client, damien harkin? Mm-hmm. Kid stole a chicken from costco. Richardson agreed to a plea Of simple theft, and supervised release, But judge baxter gave him nine months. And you filed a motion to reconsider. You bet I did. Baxter denied it. On what grounds? Sentence within guidelines, Judicial discretion. So, every day, they just put out all that food? Every day. Why don't you... No, no. I had lunch. Baxter is a bipolar sentencer, but nobody wants To confront him because we all gotta go back there. You're looking to file a motion to reconsider? I am. Last year, we started segregating cases by judges. These are all baxter cases. Maybe I'll just grab one. Please. ♪ ♪ Wow. Yes. Your honor. (both chuckling) It's not a given. Sure it is. Cook county democrats say you're a judge, you're a judge. Vote's a formality. So you think I should. I think you'd be crazy not to. These chances don't come along every day. And the firm? We survived losing stern. We'll... Survive losing you. And my people? Your people? The lawyers who came over with me. That's funny, I thought they were our people. Isn't that what we said the first day-- no fiefdoms? We also said we wouldn't stab each other in the back. Oh, and we didn't. Stern left of his own free will. Just promise me you won't clean house. Diane... If it were the reverse, Would you promise me? Congratulations, diane. Ah... Cary: So, aren't you Lead attorney on sheffrin-marks? Why are we doing this? This is sheffrin-marks. Well, sheffrin, anyway. He asked us to take care of his housekeeper's kid And Alicia promptly went out and got him locked up. Sorry. These are all from legal aid. Baxter's cases. On this side, everybody got probation. On that, jail time. So you're filing a motion to reconsider, based on what? He's a racist. I'd take this up to will, get his advice. No. You're barking up the wrong tree. Baxter's old-school liberal, million man March, all that. And, of course, liberals can't be racists. Hey, I'm just... 20 cases doesn't mean anything. We need to know the race of everyone else baxter sentenced, And then do a regression analysis To look at other variables that could explain the pattern. So, kalinda, you, uh, help Alicia with the hard data For her motion, and use mr. Statistics here. He has nothing better to do. Who says I got nothing better to do? (laughing) I do. All right. Thanks, man. Hey, one thing. I wouldn't go to will. Why? He's best buds with baxter. How do you know? I researched all the partners. Didn't you? Thanks. Alicia: I could be wrong. It's a small sampling. Get a larger one. So you think I should pursue the biased sentencing charge? What else do you have? Mitigation. Or withdraw the plea. Argue that baxter didn't properly admonish terrence. Maybe on an appeal, But you have to get back to baxter with this motion. When illinois still had the death penalty, Juries were ten times more likely To sentence an african- American than a white one. I challenged three death sentences with that argument. And did it work? Twice. Judges should know they can't get away With bias in sentencing. But I don't want to fight a cause At the expense of a client. You won't. Get a larger sampling. Don't make your argument specific to baxter. Throw in a few other judges, too. If baxter is smart, He'll read between the lines and reconsider. You know judge baxter is a friend of will's? I don't see the relevance. This isn't personal. A judge's job is to be an impartial arbiter. Two lifeguards to every swimmer. If baxter fails, it's in everybody's interest To make that known. Thank you. No problem. You should knock on my door more often, Alicia. I will. You're doing a good job. My apologies if I haven't told you that until now. Thank you. Her name is shannon. She rode her bike here. She wouldn't let me phone her mother. Mm-hmm? Well, I-I just think she's a little mature for grace. Her father's in prison, you know. Jackie, your son's in prison. Well, yes, but he's not in statesville. (laughs quietly) What? I wish I could laugh about it. I'm not laughing about it. I'm laughing about you. Oh, well, yes, that would be me-- figure of fun. Look, I'm just glad that grace has a friend. She's been slow to make friends at school. (scoffs) Then let me introduce her To some friends at the dlc. Oh, no, jackie, not the debutante stuff. Well, it's not the way it used to be. You know, there are black cotillions, Mexican cotillions; The girls work in soup kitchens. (uncomfortable sigh) Jackie, why... Why don't we just let gracie pick her own friends, okay? Have you even asked grace What her friend's father is in prison for? D-don't you think we should at least find that out? What if it's something bad? What if it is? She's not her father. (phone ringing) Hello? Much as I hate to admit it, Stat boy may have something. We looked at all the kids Baxter sent to detention, sorted by date. The racial pattern didn't exist before-- The racial pattern didn't exist before June 2008. Why? I still don't know if it's racism Or if it's something else. Do you want to talk to her? Nah. Kalinda: Look, we don't know, But something in June changed for baxter. What? I don't know. Can you find out? Oh, yeah. Went for it, huh? I had to. It's a beautiful day today, isn't it, danny? So let's all take a short break, shall we? Everybody get some sunshine. Counselor-- in chambers. Not you, mr. Richards. Have some birthday cake? No, thank you, your honor. Happy birthday. It's not mine. Court reporter. (baxter groans) So... I'm biased against african-Americans, huh? Your honor, we looked at five years of-- who's that? President obama, Senator burris... I don't think I need to take lessons from you, ma'am. I didn't think I was trying to teach you any-- What was your husband's record on racial issues? I mean, before he went to prison? Your honor, this isn't about my husband. You're damn right it's not; it's about me. You sentenced terrence ramsay too har-- Do not interrupt me! Who the hell are you? I'm a lawyer in your court, sir. I'm a lawyer who filed a motion to... Did you consider the education of the defendant In your little statistical jeremiad? Did you consider family structure, Community services, quality of representation? No. You went right to race, didn't you? My motion didn't single you out, sir. And how clever was that? Nice one. Warning shot. Send mr. Ramsay home or else. That's not what I was trying to do. I was trying to point out a pattern That you might not be aware of. Look, here's the thing: I don't respond well to being threatened, Mrs. Florrick, So why don't you withdraw this motion Before it becomes a part of the record? Withdraw it. Are we understood? We're understood. All your cell phones. Come on, let's go. I didn't even know Alicia had a case before you. Pretty sure she doesn't anymore. Ah... Guess he's back already for another lesson. Huh? How's his honor today? His honor's getting ready to skywalk your ass. (laughs) How they treating you in kiddie court? They love me. There you go, judge. So how long's she been at the firm? A few months. What's the case? Run of the mill. Of course, she treated it like a matter for the supreme court-- Precedents from death row appeals, Constitutional references on every page. You know, rookie mistakes. Her heart's in the right place. She'll get there. Her heart's in the right place?! That used to be the quickest way to get fired from your firm. Are you sleeping with her? Fingers crossed that Florrick loses his appeal? Nope. Wow! You look serious. Just not sleeping with her. Not even a little bit? Not even in your head? Hey, about this case? Do your girlfriend a favor. Tell her to move on. What happened? They called. They said terrence got hurt. Now they won't let me see him. Visiting hours are over, ma'am. Her son got hurt. Yeah-- she can come back tomorrow. She works and it's an hour's drive. Could you make an exception? No visitors, Except between 11:00 and 2:00. Could I speak to your supervisor? Sure. He'll be in at 9:00 tomorrow. I let him keep the lights on at home. He's scared of the dark. You think they let him keep a light on in there? I don't know. I baby him too much. No matter how old, They're always our babies. I hoped he wouldn't have to face things like this. Just thought if I watched him real close... (walking away) Cary: So, what's this? Kalinda: Baxter's old house. I'm meeting a friend. So don't talk, all right? I used to work with this guy. What's that supposed to mean? Don't move an inch. 
 
 Hey, frank. Kay. You bring a friend? I come in peace. Colleague. Not my decision. What's your beef with judge baxter? I don't think I have one. Then why'd you want to meet? I came across a crime report With your name on it. You mind walking me through it, frank? Burglar broke in here. Back window. Flipped the lock. The judge wasn't home. Only his wife. No warning from the security system? Mm-mm. And what did the guy want? Mrs. Baxter said it was robbery. Said? She was pretty shaken up. She had a cut on her cheek, Wrist looked like somebody had been handling her. Rape. Cary: Why lie about being raped? Cary, want to go and sit in the car? I couldn't find A case file in the s.A.'s office. You never caught the guy. Bad description? No, good description. His honor phoned later. Said his wife just wanted to drop it. She happen to mention the race of the perp? Yeah. African-American. Why? And this happened in the summer of 2008. Yep. June. I don't believe it. People aren't that simple. People are exactly that simple. Before the assault, Baxter's sentencing is race-neutral. After, it's not. Yeah, but that could be anything. People do things for a hundred reasons. No, people like to think they do things for a hundred reasons. They do things for one reason. For what reason? Come on, yoda-- what reason? s*x, money, hatred, love. You want to make people mysterious. People aren't mysterious. Okay, then the same thing goes for you. You're not mysterious. By the same logic, you're completely knowable. Sure. Okay, so then hit me. I want to know. Go ahead. Cary, you and I have nothing in common 'cause you and I are from different worlds. And it's not just Mars and venus, it's spaghetti and hydrogen. We're different categories. I'm knowable, but just not to you. Grace: I just want things to be normal. Everybody else's dads are normal. Maybe nothing's normal. I mean,  Maybe we decide what's normal. (scoffs) You and me? Yeah! Okay, what do you want to be normal? Oh, I don't know-- eating dessert for breakfast? Okay, that's normal now. (laughs) No school on thursdays. No, mondays. Those are really bad. Living in chicago is abnormal. (doorbell rings) Yeah, really abnormal. Hi, I'm shannon's mother. Oh, hello. Nice to meet you. I just... Um... I'm sorry. I need to take shannon home now. Oh, I'm glad you came. I was worried about shannon riding her bike home. Please come in. Actually, no, I can't. I'm sorry. We have to... We're in a bit of a rush. Grace... Shannon, your mother's here! So you live in garfield park. Yes. Grace: Yeah? What? "yes," what. Shannon's mother's here. Hey, mom. Uh, this is grace. Hi. I'm sorry. We have to go. Do you have your homework? See you tomorrow. Bye. What'd you say to her? Nothing. Baxter should have disclosed this. Kalinda: They arrested a guy Who fit the description mrs. Baxter gave them, But she wouldn't come in to I.D. Wasn't up to it. Baxter asked them to let it go. What can I do with this? Not much. Judges are human. It's like alan dershowitz. Before 9/11, he believed Police coercion was unconstitutional. After 9/11, he argued for torture. How's your kid doing? My kid? Oh, terrence. Fractured arm, some bruises. He's recovering. He's still in the infirmary? He goes back in the general population in two days. Not a lot of time to work with. The way I see it, it doesn't make sense To go back to baxter with the same motion. We should try to take the cases away from him. File a motion to substitute for cause. Let me try a more direct route. And sheffrin-marks-- that's your client or will's? Both of ours. But he brought it in. Uh, yes. Why? We would rather it not be you. It doesn't look good Representing a pharmaceutical company Against 300 working-class plaintiffs. And your name, "lockhart"" That's an english name? We don't need to bring that up now. What's wrong with my name? Well, the electorate is 19% irish. They go for an irish name. I know-- the things we have to think about. I think a speech To the irish-American heritage center handles the problem. Could you give us a minute? What's wrong? Do you know a henry baxter? Yes. Juvenile court? Yes, I know. You have a junior associate accusing him of racism. No-- biased sentencing. I'm glad you brought this up, diane. That's what I like about you-- Very direct. I was gonna talk to you about it. You need to talk to her. Who? Your junior associate. Ask her to apologize to baxter. You're kidding. No. You said you wanted to get rid of the swimmers. More lifeguards. Yes. Baxter is a lifeguard. I... But he acts in contravention to the law. Well, that's a matter of opinion. No, it's not. It's a fact. Judges don't go up against each other, diane. You can't question a sitting judge. Yes, but you can. You're the chief justice. I want to know that you're serious about running, diane. I've told you I am. Yes. Now you have to act Like you are. Talk to your junior associate. It's one kid sentenced-- that's all. Don't turn over the apple cart Because of one kid. No continuance. Excuse me, your honor? I said no continuance. We're going to trial. Your honor, I... The plaintiff has acquiesced to our request. Yes, and the bench has not. What is so hard to understand here, mr. Gardner? You asked for a continuance, I said no. Next motion. That, young sir, is called a tax. You complained about baxter To the chief justice? Yes. What is this, Some last parting gift to the firm? Baxter's wife was assaulted, And he's been sentencing from his bias ever since. You don't know that. You don't know why anybody decides anything. I have eyes. And you'd have them, too, If he weren't a friend. And what? Seriously, what? You gonna recall a judge? Let's figure out how that works 'cause I'd love to see that plan. Anybody can fight city hall. What they can't fight are judges. There's a kid in prison right now. Come on, diane. You don't even know his name. This stopped being about a kid a while ago. Jackie: Grace? Where's shannon? I don't know. I thought she was coming home with you. Yeah, I thought so, too. But I guess whatever you told her mom worked. I-I never said anything to her mom. (door shuts) (sighs anxiously) (doorbell rings) (sighs anxiously) Hello? Hello. We met yesterday. I'm jackie, grace's grandmother. I'm here to pick up grace. She's not here. Really? She said she'd be coming here right after school-- Her best friend's house. Mom? It's okay, shannon. What do you want? I want to know why you're doing this. I don't need to talk to you. You're wasting water. You should turn that off. Get off my property. Your husband is in a much worse prison than my son. We should be worried about you, not you us. Okay, you want to know why? Because your son put my husband in prison. He did not. He was the state's attorney. My husband never sold a drug a day in his life, And your son put him in prison for ten years For something he didn't do. You're a very gullible woman. And you're a bitch! My son is an honorable man. If he put your husband in prison, he deserved it. Go to hell. Leave it alone. (gasping) Okay. We got a problem. Really? Stat boy says we have a problem. Blacks go to detention, whites go home, right? Question is why. We know why. An african-American man Assaults baxter's wife, he starts meteing out Harsher sentences to blacks-- but look-- I analyzed his sentences Using two nonracial factors. First, his family structure. Single parent homes, Two parent homes. The racial makeup stays the same. Now, age. Under 14, over 14. The racial makeup-- It's the same. There was no change in sentencing in June of 2008? No, there is a change. It was a drastic change. But it wasn't because of race. Alicia: Well, if it wasn't race, What was it? I don't know. I'm telling you what it's not, I can't tell you what it is. So, the assault of baxter's wife is irrelevant. To his change in sentencing. No. We know it's relevant because, in June of 2008, He started handing out harsher sentences. But we just don't know why. We need to talk. Tomorrow. I'm late for lunch. Henry baxter. No. Everyone out there Is pussyfooting around you Because you're his friend. I said no. Look, I know you're my boss And you can tell me get lost when you want, But something happened. Henry is not a racist. You have any idea what a charge Like that does to somebody in chicago? I know he's not a racist. But something did happen, will. He started sentencing more harshly last June. You're his best friend. So help me. What happened? I don't know. But you suspect. No. He borrowed some money, that's all. How much? About $120,000. He said he was in a tight spot. Gambling. But he was gonna make it right. Did he pay it back? Some. Say anything about an enforcer visiting his house? A bookie's enforcer? No. Why? That's why he dropped the charges. It wasn't rape, he knew the attacker. What? (whispers): Damn. What? Man: So you have a client who might be sent here? Yeah. He's in juvenile court right now, But his family's really worried. Well, first of all, I'm sorry. And second, we're a private facility. All we do is handle the overflow Of juveniles sentenced to cook county. So we are very safe here. One guard to every 20 inmates. Oh, thank goodness. Then they pay you. The county does. Yes. For every juvenile, we get a stipend. That's how it works. And how do you know henry baxter? Judge baxter? Yes. He's a friend. You guys met, right? Sorry, he told me, but I forgot. Through our wives. You know ellen? Yes. Wonderful tennis player. Yes. We went sailing. Last June? Around there. Oh, will you excuse me? This way to the exit. So is that when you arranged the kickbacks? The...? The money you gave henry for sending kids to you. Whose idea was it, Yours or his? Officer michael, could you show these two out? Come on, was it yours or his?! You better start looking For a good defense attorney, pal! You look good in action. (scoffs) How does this happen? It happens. So what's the solution? Don't trust anybody? Works for me. Hey. Okay, what'd I do now? Just give me an explanation, henry. Even a half-ass one will do. Okay... Thought we were working the zone defense. Spent the morning with your ex. Ellen. Really. So how's she doing? I asked her about your gambling. So what is this, an intervention? No; I wish we had done that a year ago. People are filling your head with nonsense, will. What nonsense? Like you being in debt, your sudden interest in Sending kids to palgrave academy? You, my friend, are in thrall to your junior associate. She wandered out on some wild tangent, And now you're following her out there? How much does palgrave pay you per kid? How much? Ellen doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Okay? She's ill. You know that, will. Did you even just say the words to yourself To see how they sounded? "i'm sending kids to prison to make money." It's not even about doing good. Nobody here is helping orphans, but this, How can you even live a day with this? Palgrave is a good place for rehabilitation. These kids are better off there. Come on. How bad do you have to behave Before you start acknowledging it. Don't you dare judge me. You-- The litigator who whored himself out to the lowest scum. Don't you dare judge me. You're going to jail. What?! Hey! (pop music playing faintly) (computer beeping) Your grandmother's crazy. I told you. My mother was gonna sue. I thought you weren't supposed to be talking to me. So... Let's not talk. I won't if you won't. (laughs) So does your mom know your grandma's crazy? She suspects it but... Wait, so, what did your mom do? Well, she freaked out, like, off the wall. She, like, came into the house, head-to-toe soaking wet, Like as if she, like, took a bath and like, went for a swim. (laughing): I'm so sorry! How you doing, terrence? I'm okay. Adler: Hello. I'm chief justice adler. Yes, I'm thalia ramsay. Adler: And this must be terrence. Yes, ma'am. That judge worked for me, terrence. I share responsibility for what he did. I'm very sorry. It's okay. Thank you. You don't know how much this... It's proving more difficult to overcome than we'd like. My english surname. Well, that never helps. But your client roster. I'm sorry. I could still run. Yes, you could. We'd send in a ringer to undercut your support. It wouldn't be pretty. Might still be fun. Better to wait. Let us see how you do here the next few years.
