 Previously on "revenge"... 
 Daddy! 
 (Emily) When I was a child, my father was framed for a crime he didn't commit. 
 (David) You're making a mistake! 
 Amanda! 
 Amanda Clarke no longer exists. 
 Before he died, he left a road map for revenge that led me to the people who destroyed our lives. 
 Why are you so interested in this girl? 
 Because she's interested in my son. 
 (Adam) Stay away from Charlotte. 
 (Grunting) 
 What do you think you're doing, bringing Jack here? 
 It's nice to see you again. 
 Dad! 
 I want you to start following her. 
 Something's not right here. 
 (Helicopter blades whirring) 
 (Man) Freeze! Don't move! 
 (Man) FBI! 
 Let me go! Show me your hands! 
 Stop resisting! 
 Let go! 
(Man) Hands up! 
 Check the upstairs! 
 (Whirring continues) 
 Amanda Clarke. 
 (Grunts) 
 How long did you really think you could fool me? 
 You must be as stupid as your father. 
 (Grunts) 
(Man) Get on the ground! 
 (Gasps) 
 (Pants) 
 (Footsteps fall) 
 (Emily exhales) 
 (Objects clatter)

 (Exhales) 
 (Pants) 
 Sammy. 
 (Sammy whines) 
 (Sighs) 
 What are you doing here? 
 (Whining) 
 Hmm? 
 What's that? What's this? 
 (Laughs) 
 You're such a good boy. 
 (Cell phone beeps) 
 (Laughs) 
 Oh, good boy. 
 Good boy. 
(Whines) 
 Ciao, Margaret. How's Italy? 
 Weren't you on the landmark preservation committee last winter with Michael Davis? 
 Yes, just before he split with Lydia. 
 Come on. 
 Do you remember a lovely young woman by the name of Emily Thorne? 
 She paid obscenely for the Davis cottage next door, and you know how I can be about that kind of thing. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Lid clatters) 
 (Gasps) 
 No, I don't want to keep you. You run. 
 All right, darling. Bye.

 (Knock on door) 
 (Whispers) Get down. 
 (Victoria) Charlotte, it's 11:00. 
 (Normal voice) Yeah, mom. Happens twice a day. 
 Well, my meeting's starting right now, and it'd be nice if you would put on one of the dresses I bought you and made an appearance. 
 Sorry. I already made plans. 
 (Sighs) Outgrow this, please, I beg of you. 
 Oh, and you might want to let Adam know that the drainpipe he scurried up is in full view of the conservatory.

 Good morning, Adam.

 Morning, Mrs. Grayson. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Laughs) 
 And in keeping with your husband's image, we're planning a sort of upscale barbecue. 
 A-are you sure the courtyard can hold a hundred guests plus media? 
 I mean, the senator loves his media. 
 Mm. I know how much he covets the spotlight, but I promise you, there's enough room for everyone. 
 And if Victoria says "don't worry," you can take that to the bank. Mm. 
 Speak of the devil. Senator Kingsly. 
 Thank you. 
 How was the golf game? 
 Daniel spanked us old-timers. 
 Ah, lucky round. 
 Steve, are we done here? 
'Cause I'd like to get back to the hotel for a shower. 
 You should stay here. 
 Oh, no. We'd... we'd hate to impose. 
 Nonsense. That's why we built this home. 
 Isn't that right, Victoria? 
 Well, all right, then. Perfect. 
 (Conrad) All right. 
 All right. I'll send for your bags. And here. 
 I took another pass at your candidacy speech. 
 Thanks, Steve. 
 Mrs. Grayson, I'm so sorry I'm late. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 I know you were counting on some of my ideas. 
 Well, we've already just wrapped, Ms. Thorne. 
 We managed to get it under control without you. 
 Emily Thorne. 
 It's nice to see you again, senator Kingsly. 
 (Senator Kingsly) 
What a small world. 
 Conrad, Victoria, why didn't you tell me you knew Emily? 
 Well, we've only just met. 
 How do you two know each other? 
 Ms. Thorne was a senior volunteer in my first campaign. 
 And what was the name of the organization you believe David Clarke was laundering money for? 
 The same Americon initiative that claimed responsibility for blowing up flight 197 last summer? Did you come here to help me finish what I started? Well, I'm a big believer in finishing what you start. Then you have to stay for dinner. (Victoria) Well, it's summer in the Hamptons. I can't believe the young lady doesn't already have plans. Actually, she does. 
(Chuckles) With me. Well, there you have it. (Chuckles) Excuse me. (Woman) Moments ago, a jury found terrorist conspirator David Clarke guilty on all counts. The case, spearheaded by federal prosecutor Tom Kingsly, was a big win for both the United States and the young attorney. Rumors are circulating that a political career is in the not-too-distant future for Kingsly. (Clicks keyboard key) (Cell phone beeps) (Cell phone rings) (Beeps) Well, well, well. If it isn't the Thorne in everyone's side. To what do I owe the pleasure? Is it possible to hack a computer tablet to run a powerpoint presentation? Possible for you or possible for me? Can you do it or not? With both hands tied behind my back  if  you tell me why. You don't need to know why. Fine. Get me the tablet's IP address and I'll make it so you can run whatever program you want. I already sent it. Check your in-box. (Beep) (Beep) (Scoffs) You're welcome, Mary Sunshine. (Sighs, clicks keyboard key) (Tom) Today I am just grateful that justice prevailed and that this terrible man has been held accountable for his crimes against the American people. As for the future, I have always planned to serve my country however and wherever it needs me most. (Reporters shouting indistinctly) (footsteps approach) Do you like the necklace? What woman wouldn't? I'm just curious as to why you're angrier today than you were yesterday. Because yesterday, I didn't have a house full of unwanted guests. Wear the teal. Fine. You don't like Tom's politics. Oh, I couldn't care less about his politics. It's him I don't like. Well, he's done more for us than we'll ever be able to do for him. How could I ever forget? Come on. This will all be over before you know it, and then... We can go to Paris for a few days, you know? Whatever you like. I want to make this right. Then you never should've slept with my best friend. (Clicks keyboard keys) (Beeping) Just a second. (Clicks keyboard keys) Hi. Hey. Oh, you look lovely. Thank you. You're punctual. Is that a bad thing? No, not at all. I'll just grab my stuff. All set. Well, aren't you full of surprises? What can I say? I live alone. We should go shooting sometime. We definitely should. Shall we? We shall. (Jack) My dad always said that an empty bar is a sad bar. He'd be happy to see you all here today. He might not have wanted a funeral, but he didn't say anything about a wake, so, everybody, drink up. To Carl Porter. (All) To Carl Porter. And, uh, in honor of Jack and Declan's father, next round's on me. (All cheer) You didn't have to do that. You didn't even know my dad. No, but... Obviously, he's a... he's a good guy... all these people drinking here to honor him. When my dad bites it, people will be drinking to celebrate. What can I get for you, man? Uh, you know to make a Malibu Bay Breeze? I do. I would strongly advise against it. It's more of a whiskey and beer crowd. Well... (Clears throat) 
When in Rome... ♪ Ah, hey, sporty. Whose fist did you walk into? Oh, some rich jerkwad. There's a lot of 'em around this time of year. You, uh, planning on getting even? Considering I'm half the guy's size with half the friends, no. Violence is only one way to take someone down. (Indistinct conversations) That's what I've been saying. The family values crowd would eat that up. Well, then here's to family values. (Clears throat) And the passage of the Kingsly finance bill. When I'm reelected, it's my first order of business. All this talk of politics. (All laugh) Believe me, I'm used to it. What a lovely necklace, Victoria. (Tablet chimes) Thank you. Excuse me. I'm expecting an e-mail from the majority leader. (Chirps) It'll just... I'm sorry. (Clears throat) Steve, please come with me. Excuse me. 
(Clears throat) (Chirps) (Beeps) (Steve) Oh, man. You've gotta be kidding me. Find out where this came from. Now. Everything all right, senator? (Man) ♪ was looking for his mother ♪ (Turns engine off) (Man) Welcome to Tuscany. Thank you. What is this place? Looks interesting. It's an Italian steak house. Ashley turned me on to it. (Indistinct conversations) Red leather booths and everything. Too old-school? Not at all. Just... Would've guessed you more Sushi bar than steak house. The bloodier the better. Could you excuse me for a second? Yeah. (Indistinct conversations continue) Excuse me. Hi. Um, I'm at that table over there in the middle, and I don't have a steak knife. I'm sorry. I'll bring you one. Okay. Thanks. (Indistinct conversations continue) Hey, can we get a bottle of sparkling water, please? What the hell are you doing here? Patrick, I-I had no idea... I'm... (Grunting) (People speaking indistinctly) Whoa. Wait here. Patrick. Patrick, stop. Stop! Patrick! Patrick. Look, I know how pissed you are, okay? And you have every right to be. But you have no idea how sorry I am about everything that happened. You  happened, Grayson. And if you were man enough to take responsibility for what you did, you wouldn't be apologizing to me. You'd be apologizing to my sister. (People speaking indistinctly) It's a video of you walking into a building. What's the big deal? (Lid clatters) (Tablet chimes) (Beeps) You've got another one. (Sets glass down) I gather that's not your niece. (Door slides open) What on earth is going on here? Oh, more politics, I'm afraid. Ah. Trouble with the majority leader? I didn't want to bore you with this. David Clarke is innocent, and I can prove it. Tell the judge and have him call back the jury. They're already in deliberations. And now you're telling me, you committed perjury? Don't believe her. She's in love with him. What the hell is going on here? What's going on here is, you've just argued an airtight case against the most hated man in America and when the jury convicts him, you're gonna be an instant national hero. Your political future, Tom, is wide open, and you have a powerful supporter in me. Now if you decide to listen to my wife, who's foolishly fallen in love with that monster, you're gonna throw all that away. It's your call. What's the crisis? (Steve) There is no crisis. Just a little situation. Frank. Victoria. You and Diane go ahead and finish dinner without us. It might take a little while. Rest assured, we're gonna take care of it. Don't you always? Thanks. I'm... I'm sorry you had to see that. But in a way, I'm also glad it happened. You have a right to know what you're getting into. Well, what am I getting into? I mean, who was that guy? Patrick Munello. I dated his sister last summer. Her name's Sara. So you break the sister's heart, and then big brother breaks your car? Actually, I broke her spine. Oh, my God. She wasn't paralyzed, thank God, but, you know, it's still a struggle for her. How did that happen? My mom, as you know, has a lot of expectations. Her son dating a cocktail waitress from Portsmouth not one of them. So towards the end of the summer, my mom made her feelings public at one of her parties. And I took off with Sara, drunk. Wrapped my car around a utility pole, and... they had to cut us both out. So where is she now? Still in rehab last I heard. I haven't spoken to her since that night. My parents covered Sara's medical bills and set her up so she wouldn't have to worry, paid a judge off to keep me out of jail, and in return, I had to swear I'd never see her again. It sounds like you regret that now. Every day. Do you think I'm a bad person? I think... People who make mistakes should own up to them. You should go talk to her. Tell her what you're telling me now. When did the affair end? February, but on good terms. I don't believe she'd be behind this. Then it can be managed. If it comes out, you both deny it. Candidates survive this sort of thing all the time. You're not telling us the whole story. (Tom) Shortly before we decided to move on, Erin got pregnant. We talked about it, and she decided not to have the baby. I sent her the money to take care of it. You know the senator's politics on the issue. If it gets out, he's done. More importantly, my wife would be devastated. Well, then we have to make it so that it doesn't get out.

Then she said you sent her a red dress and a plane ticket to be here tonight. That doesn't make any sense. What does she stand to gain by forcing my resignation? Your opponent could've paid her. Or a jealous staffer with access to your correspondence could've set the whole thing up. What? That's insane. Tom, I have dedicated my entire career to you. Tom. What's going on?

But look on the bright side... you can party all summer, and I'll be your designated driver. Yeah? Well, then let's get started. Where to? Actually, I'm exhausted, but you guys go. Have fun. You sure? Mm-hmm. Okay. See you soon. Night. Let's talk. Drive safely now. Well, I'm stunned. You never can tell with people, can you? Indeed. Good night, Emily. Good night, Mrs. Grayson. Actually... Would you mind terribly if I started calling you Victoria? Of course. Then good night, Victoria. Go away, Nolan. I have to know. How did you do it? How'd you get your hands on a s*x tape?

God, you're so beautiful.
