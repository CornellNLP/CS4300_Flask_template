 (Woman) 
When I was a little girl, my understanding of revenge was as simple as the Sunday school proverbs it hid behind. 
 Neat little morality slogans, like "do unto others" and "two wrongs don't make a right. " (Gunshot) (Angus & Julia Stone) 
♪ if you love me ♪ (Fireworks popping and whistling) But two wrongs can never make a right because two wrongs can never equal each other. (Whistling and popping continues) (Dance music playing faintly) (People speaking indistinctly) (Indistinct conversations) ♪ (Speaks indistinctly) For the truly wronged... Real satisfaction can only be found in one of two places... Absolute forgiveness... Or mortal vindication. ♪ This is not a story about forgiveness. (Woman, British accent) 
Emily. ♪ I've been looking for you. Where's Daniel? Uh, he's walking the beach. We're having a thing. Same thing or different thing? Same thing. But don't worry. He's right behind me. It's my job to worry. Your job is to enjoy yourself. It's your engagement party. Can someone get me a 20 on Daniel Grayson? Hey, congrats, Emily. Thank you. (Indistinct conversations) ♪ Nice night for it. Nice night for what, Nolan? Celebrating. (Woman) Emily, where have you been hiding? (Woman) Come on. Let's see that ring, girl. (Emily) Hi. (Indistinct conversations continue) (Grunting) (Panting) (Grunts) ♪ (Indistinct conversations) (Laughs) I feel like a jackass in this tux. Well, stop acting like one, and you'll stop feeling like one. Trust me. If your friends could see you now... I'd probably get jumped. Mm. ♪ Hey, you really want outta that tux? (Indistinct conversations continue) ♪ (Thud) (Music playing faintly) (Voices murmuring faintly) Come on. We'll run away together. You're slow. (Laughs) 
I'm going. I'm going. Little too much food lately. (Laughing) Come on. Maybe not. (Girl laughs) (Boy) 
Where are we going? (Laughs) You ask too many questions. (Laughs) Show me what you got, bad boy. Here. Let me help you. I got it. I got it. (Speaks indistinctly) Fire and ice... When we first sat down to discuss tonight's occasion, I was immediately taken with the idea of an evening inspired by primal bookends... fire and ice... Beginnings and endings... And the love between a man and a woman. (Applause) (Phone rings) (Applause continues) (Cell phone rings) (Ring) Yo. Yo, 8 mile, private party here! 
(Ring) (Woman speaking indistinctly, amplified voice) (Woman)... A starry evening. 
(Phone rings) That creep better not be taking pictures. (Cell phone rings) Hey! (Ring) 
You got a problem?! (Woman continues speaking indistinctly, amplified voice) (Ring) Tonight not only marks the final weekend of a remarkable summer in the Hamptons, it is also the celebration of my son Daniel's engagement... 
(Ringing) To the lovely and beguiling Ms. Emily Thorne. (Indistinct shouting) (Applause) And though we've only known her for a few short months, Emily already feels like the piece of the family puzzle we never even knew was missing. (Guests) Aw. In a word, I approve. (Chuckles) 
And as anyone can tell you, approval is not something I give away freely. (All laugh) Where the hell is my son? (Indistinct conversations) Charlotte. Oh, my God. (Gasps) Mom! My brother... Somebody come here! (Guests speaking indistinctly) (Charlotte) Come here! Mom! Daniel! (Woman) Daniel! Daniel! Get away from my son! Daniel! Daniel, please! 
(Crying) No! Daniel! (Woman) I can't tell you what a rare opportunity you have here, Ms. Thorne. The current owners live in the city, of course, but they've been loyal hamptonites for years. Perhaps if Mr. Davis had been a bit more loyal to his wife, they wouldn't be renting out this season. Word has it, he dumped her for a girl half his age. 
(Chuckles) Men. You mind if I look around a bit? (Sets picture down) That's what we're here for. (Door opens) (Wind chimes tinkling) (Gulls crying) (Door closes) ♪ Here I go ♪ (Girl) Dad? ♪ I'll tell you ♪ Hey, kiddo. You having fun exploring? We really get to spend the whole summer here? And every summer after that. What do you think? I think mom would've loved it. Hey, you know how much I love you, Amanda? Infinity? Well, infinity... ♪ With all of your heart ♪ Times infinity. ♪ If you love me ♪ (Door opens) 
Ms. Thorne? Now you have to imagine, it's Memorial Day weekend, 75 and sunny, all those boys of summer wondering who the new girl is. And that's Grayson manor. You won't find a better address than this. I'll take it. Oh. Wonderful. I'll get the contract. ♪ Shining your light ♪ 
♪ my way ♪ (man) ♪ say la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ 
♪ say la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ (Knock on door) Hello, hello. Ashley, hey. Hey. What do you think? Are you kidding? Look at this place. I want your life. You love your life. Yeah, you're right. I just want your money. What's mine is yours. Should I get us some glasses? I wish. It's for Victoria Grayson. Who? You are hopeless. Victoria Grayson... reigning queen of the Hamptons. Not to mention, your new next door neighbor. Queen Victoria? Mm. Believe me, she's earned the title. My boss has me handling the guest list for her Memorial Day party. Mm. If I screw this up, I might as well move back to Croydon. Well, how much are the tickets? 10,000 a pop. Count me in for one. Are you sure? It's for a good cause, right? Yeah, my career. Thank you. You want to get drunk on cheap Margaritas later? With or without you. Good luck with her highness. Bye. (Wind chimes tinkling) Let's dump our long position on 5- and 10-year treasuries before the fed stops buying them up. And, uh, get us into some of those low-rated tech bonds. Thanks. Looks like Lydia and Michael's new renter is settling in. (Cell phone beeps) Lucky girl, scoring that property. Pretty one, too, even from up here. I guess that makes her doubly lucky. I don't believe in luck. I thought you were taking the weekend off. (Tv playing indistinctly) Mm. Hey. Ew. Get a room, you guys. Oh, I'm sorry, Charlie. I didn't see you sneaking in. Didn't see you sneaking out last night, either, Charlotte. I went over to Tracey's. Told you I was going before you went to bed. No, you didn't. Mom, you're too young and too pretty to be this senile. Hmm. (Tv continues playing indistinctly) Remind me to buy her a cat bell. Aw, let her have a little fun. She got straight a's this year. No one's accusing her of being stupid. ♪ (People speaking indistinctly) Don't think I didn't see you eyeballing that case of beer, dec. Our dad owns a bar, dumbass. I can get as much beer as I want. All right. Well, in that case, I'll just have to make sure dad double-checks the inventory while I'm gone. Uh-huh. Yeah. Why don't you tell me another hundred times, huh? Did you already wash those garbage bins out back? Beats uploading this future shipwreck. ♪ Ahoy! Captain Porter. (Chuckles) Welcome back, Nolan. What can I do for you? Need a boat for the summer. This one will do. It's not for rent. Who said anything about renting? How much you want for... "Amanda"? It's not for sale, either. ♪ I'm taking it down to Haiti next week. I thought you hated the ocean. Well, I-I spent a lot of time and money working through that, amongst other things. So... I'm buying a boat. Right. Just not this one. (People speaking indistinctly) Amanda must be some special girl. Can I help you with something? You don't like me much, do you? One more thing for you to work through, I guess. (People continue speaking indistinctly) ♪ (Ashley) 
The response to your "in with the new" 
Memorial Day party has been overwhelming, Mrs. Grayson. The party is at 90% capacity... (Women murmuring) And the "regrets" web site's already collected nearly $50,000, for everything from domestic violence prevention to cancer awareness. Some of these regrets wouldn't wipe their noses with $50,000, dear. (Women chuckle) If we're going to set a more generous tone for the summer, it's clear I'm going to have to do something fresh and provocative, so... I've decided to auction off a piece from my personal art collection. What a wild idea, Victoria. Well, I don't care how good the cause is, if you put up the Van Gogh that Michael and I gave you... (Chuckles) 
I'll kill myself. The Van Gogh is off limits for sentimental reasons. Please. 
(Sighs) Okay. Ashley, would you please add the new announcement to the web site, see if we can't drum up some more business? And, ladies, thanks again. 
(Women speak indistinctly) Lydia... We were all so sorry to hear about you and Michael this winter. You were one of those couples everyone roots for. I have no doubt. (Women speaking indistinctly) How are you holding up? Michael's threatening to put the beach house on the market if I don't release my claim on the West Side walk-up. It's bad enough, having some stranger renting it out. I can't bear the thought of losing it to one of the she-wolves. Mm. Well, then don't let them see your weakness. It's the first thing they'll use against you. (Women continue speaking indistinctly) All right? Mm-hmm. Thank you. (Sighs) (Indistinct conversations) (Angus & Julia Stone's "Hold on" playing) (Indistinct conversations continue) ♪ And I'm waiting for the day ♪ 
♪ I know you've got your part ♪ (Amanda laughing) ♪ And I'm waiting for the day ♪ Hey, you want to know a trick? Yeah. You plant your feet in the sand and you stand still through the whole first wave. Okay. Then the next wave's gonna feel warmer. Okay. And then the one after that's gonna feel warmer still. Finally, you're barely gonna notice the cold at all. (Laughs) Are you ready? Yeah. Here it comes. Okay. Aah! You must come from a family of polar bears. That water is ice cold. Only at first. After a while, you can't feel anything. Sounds like my marriage. (Chuckles) You must be the new renter. Emily Thorne. Word gets around fast. Like lightning. I'm Lydia Davis. My husband and I own the house you're staying in. Oh. (Laughs) Oh, wow. It's so nice to meet you. I can't tell you how much I love it. Me, too. Some good memories were made there. Well, hopefully I can make some of my own. So long as we don't have to take it out of your damage deposit. Welcome to the Hamptons. ♪ What do you take me for? ♪ 
♪ hold on ♪ 
♪ what did you say that for? ♪ (Man) Federal prosecutors wrapped up their case for treason against disgraced hedge fund executive David Clarke. Taking the stand was Clarke's secretary, Lydia Davis, whose testimony supported the damning allegations made by Clarke's former boss, Conrad Grayson. Grayson's testimony detailed the scheme Clarke used to channel money to the terrorists responsible for the downing of flight 1-9-7. All 246 Americans onboard that flight were killed. (Amanda) What do you like better, dad, sea glass or starfish? Dad? Starfish, definitely. Here you go. 
(Telephone ringing) Thank you. (Dog barking) (Beeps) 
David, it's Victoria. Hey, do you mind going and looking after Sammy for me? Sure. David, are you there? What's the matter, Sammy? Hey, everything okay? Whatcha doin'? (Sammy yelps, guns click) 
Daddy! Whoa, whoa. What's going on? 
(Amanda screaming) Hands up so I can see 'em. What's going on? You're making a mis... wait! You're making a mistake! Get your hands off my daughter! Aah! No! Get your hands off my daughter! 
(Screaming) Amanda! Let her go! (Continues screaming) Amanda! Amanda! (Amanda) Aah! (Lydia) David Clarke had everyone fooled, including me. I'm just glad I can help put that monster away. (Clicking button) (Beeps) No one is to approach the head table unless they're escorted by either myself or Mrs. Grayson. I cannot stress how important that seating chart is. Got it? I got it. Good. At 2:00, security will be delivering Mrs. Grayson's manet to be set up for auction in the main cabin. Okay? 
(Cell phone rings) (Sighs) Jenkins. (Rings and beeps) 
(Speaking indistinctly) Ems, please don't kill me. Well, that depends. What am I not killing you for? Standing you up this afternoon. I have a million-dollar art auction to deal with. (Camera phone shutter clicks) Oh, there's no pressure there. You want me to pick up your dress for you? Oh, you're a lifesaver. Oh, please. I'm sightseeing. You're working. I got you covered. Thank you. Bye. (Indistinct conversations) (Keypad beeping) (Indistinct conversations continue) More tea? Please. Do you think I'm tan enough for my first day on the beach or do I need another spray? What you need is another bathing suit. Compared to what the rest of my friends are wearing, this is practically a burka. (Tires squeal) Unlike the rest of your friends... (Engine revving) It's important to me that you don't end up on "page six" at one of Diddy's hot tub parties. Danny's home. (Closes car door) Ooh, Danny! (Laughs) Ah. (Laughs) (Laughs) How you doing? (Laughs) Oh. I'm so happy to see you. I'm so glad to see you. What's going on, a fire sale? (Man speaking indistinctly) 
Charity stunt. Welcome home, Daniel. Hi, mom. I'm headed down to the beach. Okay. (Daniel) 
She's growing up fast. (Laughs) Too fast. You hungry? You know, I'm a little wiped out. I think I'll just lay down for a bit. Yeah, you look a little tired. Well, studying will do that to a guy. Mm. So will partying. Mom, I just got here. Give me a break. 
(Laughs) Where's dad, golfing? Where else? Yep. Where else? (Sighs) (Panting) Now... It feels like summer. (Laughs) Champagne? (Exhales) 
You have to ask? Oh. Mm. (Growls) (Inhales sharply) (Groans) (Exhales deeply) (Objects clatter) (Lydia exhales deeply) Ah. (Inhales sharply) Ah... (Grunts) (Groans) Conrad? What's wrong? 
(Grunts) (Grunt) Are you okay? (Groans) Conrad. (Grunts) Oh, God. ♪ All right, so the first thing you do is enter the code. (Keypad beeping) 
It's not exactly... Ooh. Then you swipe the card. Then the amount. Are we eating in here? Uh, yeah. I'm afraid so. Dec. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Uh, card, swipe, amount, right? Code, swipe, amount. Jack, will you take care of the mean girls' table? It's too early in the season for me to start making enemies. Why should this year be any different? Because you're sailing off to save the world, and this place can't afford bad press. Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I got it. Okay? (Indistinct conversations) (Panting) Hi. Help you? Um, are you the owner? Hopefully not for another 30 years or so. You're looking for my dad. Some suit's looking for you. You are? Um, Doug Reid with first federal. Oh, Mr. Reid. I'll take care of him, Jack. Hey, Mr. Reid. Carl Porter. Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming down. Why don't you follow me to my office? (Girl) I know you like him. Here he comes. Ladies. We'll take three rum and diets. Uh, gonna need to see ID's. Um, we left our ID's at the beach, but we have plenty of money. (Chuckles) Yeah. Sorry. I'm not interested in your money. (Indistinct conversations) Are you interested in my phone number? (Indistinct conversations continue) (Siren wails) It looks like a stemi. We need to get him in quick. What does that mean? Is he gonna be okay? Ma'am, I need you to step back, please. Where are you taking him? Southfork hospital. Lydia. Lydia. Nice and easy, on my count. One, two... Emily Thorne. Three. My... my God. Is this your husband? Do you need a ride to the hospital? (Paramedics speaking indistinctly) No, I don't. I... (monitor beeping erratically) (Emergency radio chatter) (Paramedics continue speaking indistinctly) (Emergency radio chatter continues) (Groans) (Man)... And an EKG. As soon as we get there. (Indistinct conversations)

(Whines) Sammy. 
(Whines) Sam? (Pants) Barks. Sammy! (Laughing) 
Sammy! Get down. What's the matter with you? I'm sorry. He's not normally this friendly. He's kind of an old grump, actually. (Sammy panting) Mm. Oh, he got mud on your dress. Oh, that's no big deal. There's an Earl and Emma's dry cleaners right around the corner. I'll walk you over. Oh, that's okay. Um, I got it. Thanks. Well, hey. Uh, tell Earl and Emma that you're a friend of Jack Porter's. My family owns the tavern down by the docks, the stowaway. What's... what's your name? I'll... put you on the official comp list. You don't have to do that. Well, I'm not picking up the tab. Sammy is. He feels terrible. Don't you? (Sammy whimpers) Thanks anyway. All righty, then. (People speaking indistinctly) You have a great summer. (Barks) (Engine turns over) (Car drives away) (Woman speaking indistinctly over PA.) (Panting) (Curtain rings clatter) Hey. Oh, my God, Conrad. I thought I was going to find you dead. I'm fine. What happened? Acute abdominal dyspepsia. The remorse of a guilty stomach. Your staff made it sound as if he was having a heart attack. Well, depending on the severity, the symptoms can be identical. As far as I can tell, your husband's as healthy as a thoroughbred. But I do suggest that he stay away from the Southfork Inn's spicy bisque for a while. (Exhales) The Southfork Inn? Yeah. I thought you went golfing. Yeah, I did, earlier. Southfork is a half-hour in the opposite direction. I'm aware of that. Excuse me. Come on. You know I just get in the way when you're planning one of your parties. I just thought I would go for a drive and stay out of your hair for a while.

Look at you. Look at this party. Congratulations. Well, it's too early for that. Haven't you seen "Titanic"? (Laughs) So how well do you know these people? Well enough to know who to keep away from and who to snuggle up to. Mm. Quick tutorial? Okay. The girl in the orange Escada dress? Mm-hmm. That's Mayor Bloomberg's niece. And the woman she's talking to, now this one is important... Megan Foster. (Whispers) Shoe buyer for Barneys of New York. Ooh. ♪ (Indistinct conversations) Gray suit boy is kinda cute. (Ashley) 
That's Daniel Grayson, Victoria's tragically privileged spawn. Daniel wrapped his convertible around a tree last summer after one too many. Didn't hurt his face much. Yeah, it didn't work out quite as well for the waitress he was shagging. His parents paid off everyone and their mother to keep him out of jail. And the plot thickens. Who's that? (Nolan) You ever been on a private jet? Nolan Ross. I've got two. Former tech boom whiz kid and perennial pain in the ass. If you emptied the bank accounts of everyone at this party, it wouldn't add up to the interest... There he is... His makes in a week. Old blue eyes. (Conrad) Nolan... 
(Lowered voice) And that is queen Victoria. Wow. Hello, Nolan. Hello, Victoria. How are you? (Guests speaking indistinctly) (Speaks inaudibly) I think she spotted you. Good. Introduce us. ♪ Hey, how about that stock split, huh? What'd I tell you? Turned out great. Conrad. Yeah. We weren't sure we were going to see you this afternoon. Huh? Rumor had it that you, uh, really dodged a bullet yesterday. Oh, well, I'm happy to report that the rumors of my demise are greatly exaggerated. Oh. Well, I'm thrilled to hear it. I'll be sure to spread the word. Oh, I'm sure you will. Lydia. ♪ I just...

Where have you been hiding yourself? I left three messages for you. (Ashley) Mrs. Grayson, forgive me for interrupting. I just wanted to introduce you to a dear friend of mine. Victoria Grayson, Emily Thorne. Hello, Mrs. Grayson. Ah, Ms. Thorne. I was wondering who the late entry was on the guest roster. Well, Emily's new to the Hamptons, but she really wanted to take part in your fund-raiser. Oh. How do you two know each other? We volunteered together at the met this winter. Mm. Apparently being a sustaining patron just wasn't enough for Emily. Mm. I try to give back as much as I can. Lydia. Hi. Oh, don't tell me you've taken up volunteering at the met as well. (Laughs) Emily's renting my house for the summer. Ah. We met briefly on the beach. And then yesterday at the Southfork Inn. I hope your husband's feeling better. ♪ (Indistinct conversations) Mm. (Indistinct conversations continue) ♪ Victoria, wait. (Indistinct conversations continue) (Carl) 
Everyone, listen up, please. I just want to thank you all for helping the stowaway kick off the season right. 
(Man) You're welcome! (Man shouts indistinctly) (Cheering) Where were you people all winter? (All laugh) Tomorrow my son Jack is setting sail for Haiti to pitch in with the red cross. 
(Men) Good luck, Jack! He wanted to go right after the quake, but I convinced him to stick around an extra year to help me out. Almost two, actually, but who's counting? Was it two? 
(Laughs) Yeah. It was two. (Door closes, bell on door jingles) (Man) Good going, Jack. (Indistinct conversations) To Jack! (All) To Jack! I'm gonna miss you, son. I'm gonna miss you, too. (Man) Yeah, baby! (Doug) Mr. Porter, do you have a moment? Sure. Right this way. (Indistinct conversations continue) The bank is not going to approve any further extensions. But business is back. All's I need is 30 more days. I am sorry. It's out of my hands. (Indistinct conversations) (Playing up-tempo instrumental music) Here we go round again, Danny boy, summertime in the Hamptons. Yep. Same people, same parties... (Music continues) Same everything. (Indistinct conversations continue) Where do you want to discuss it? Yo, man. Want to bump it up a notch? (Music continues) Oh, my God! Wow. I'm so sorry. God, I'm such an idiot. No, don't worry about it. It's, uh, probably the universe telling me I need a costume change. (Chuckles) Uh... I'm Daniel. Emily. How about I get you a dry Martini? Twice the alcohol, half the stain potential. Sure. I'm sorry. No, no. It's okay. Now wait right here. (Music and indistinct conversations continue) ♪ (Indistinct conversations) How much does he owe? I'm sorry. That's between your dad and the bank. Come on. He's owned the place 30 years. How bad is it? The bank's gonna foreclose at the end of the month. The only way to stop it now is full payment on arrears. I am sorry. There's nothing I can do. ♪ (Indistinct conversations continue) ♪ (Victoria, amplified voice) 
Good afternoon, everyone, and happy Memorial Day. (Laughs) (People shouting indistinctly) (Applause) I wanted the theme of today's party to signify a fresh start for all of us. As difficult as the last few years have been, they have been devastating on our charities. But now, as things are beginning to turn around, I'm looking forward to giving back, and I know that all of you are, too. (Guests laughing and shouting indistinctly) So to start things off right, I'd like to announce the winner of the art auction, my dear friend... Lydia Davis... (Woman) Oh! (Woman) Congratulations. Who won't be going home with the manet this evening, but with the treasured Van Gogh that hangs in my living room. (Guests gasping and speaking indistinctly) But I thought the Van Gogh was a gift from Lydia and Michael. (Lowered voice) Have Ms. Davis escorted off the boat. (Amplified voice) 
And in related news, Lydia has asked me to announce that the beach house she shared with her husband is officially on the market. Ms. Davis... (Guard speaking indistinctly) 
I'm afraid this will be her final weekend in the Hamptons. (Guests speaking indistinctly) So call your realtors, ladies and gentlemen, because this one's going to go fast. And, Lydia... Wherever you end up, I hope that the Van Gogh is a constant reminder of the friendship we shared. (Guests continue speaking indistinctly) (Applause) (Screaming) (David) Get your hands off my daughter! (Screams indistinctly) (Man) I want that kid outta here. Now! Give her to social services! Daddy! (Screaming) (David) Amanda! 
(Man) Settle down! Where are you taking her?! No! Daddy! Amanda! No! She's really something, isn't she? My mother. She sure is. (Amplified voice) - A big thank-you also... To chance meetings. To an unforgettable summer. (Man speaks indistinctly) How many Harvard men does it take to screw in a lightbulb? I don't know. How many? One, and the whole world just revolves around him. (Laughs) One more? Drink or joke? Either. Both. Mm. Neither. I am just buzzed enough to find that last joke funny. One more, and I might think that you meant it. But don't let me stop you. Oh, no, no. I've had about all the club soda I can take. You don't drink? Used to... Epically. Hmm. I gotta admit, it's... it's nice meeting someone who never knew the old me. Yeah. I know the feeling. ♪ Double infinity. ♪ Something like that. That's a long time. Daniel... Your father and I are leaving. Thank you for a lovely party, Mrs. Grayson.

Well, now that you've moved in next door, I suppose we'll be seeing a lot of you this summer. ♪ I'll expect you shortly, Daniel. ♪ (Indistinct conversations and laughter) Don't let my mom rattle you. Intimidation is practically a sign of endearment with her. I'd hate to be on her bad side. Yes, you would. (Both laugh) I should go. Uh, I'm headed your way. You need a ride? No, thanks. Maybe next time. Till next time. (Indistinct conversations) ♪ (Conrad) You didn't have to exile her. What you did was cruel. Oh, what I did was cruel? 
(Laughs) You could have had anyone, and you knew she was my closest friend. It was never meant to be an affair. Oh, it just happened? Are you physically incapable of taking responsibility for your actions? There is a problem we seem to share. If you'll remember, I gave up everything once to prove how much I love you. I returned the favor. I helped you destroy a man. Oh, no, no, no. That was your idea, not mine. You did what you did to save yourself as much as me. A compromise I'm reminded of every day. You got plenty in the bargain. Oh... (Inhales sharply) (Chuckles) These guys really put the "suck" in seersucker. Want to bump it up a notch? What a waste of humanity. Oh, my God. 
(Cell phone rings and buzzes) (Laughs) I'm so sorry. God, I'm such an idiot. No, don't worry about it. 
(Speaking indistinctly) With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking? Hey. It's, uh... It's Jack Porter. Listen, if you still want to buy my boat, bring a check down to the docks first thing in the morning. Okay? There's nothing I'd like to do more. All right. See you then. (Sighs) (Cell phone beeps) ♪ (Chuckles) (Wind chimes tinkling) Welcome home, Amanda. I nearly didn't recognize you today, but that's the whole point, isn't it? Oh! Ugh! Uhh! Do you know how easy it would be for me to crush your windpipe? I don't think your father would approve. (Chokes) Amanda... Oh... Your father trusted me. My father trusted everybody. Ugh! What are you doing here, Nolan? Don't worry. Don't worry. Your secret's safe. No one wants this imperious cadre of toxic phonies to eat it more than yours truly. So how can I be of service? You can't. You're not a part of this. Yes, I am. Remember, I witnessed firsthand what these people did to your father. They're hard-core. I can handle them. And I have no problem taking you down, too, if you get in my way. I- I don't want to get in your way. I want to help you. You can't help me, Nolan. (Sighs) Suit yourself. But I can be just as powerful an enemy as any one of them. Just sayin'. (Wind chimes tinkling) Oh... You might be interested to know, I had a nice chat with Jack Porter tonight.
