 Previously on Revenge... 
 Emily, this is my grandfather, Edward Grayson. 
 I know you were in love with Amanda's father. 
 Mom, what is he talking about? 
 (Conrad) David Clarke isn't just Amanda's father. 
 He's your biological father as well. 
 I am suggesting that you step down as C.E.O., and we groom your son to take your place. 
 As you were warned, revenge is a stony path. 
 (Nolan) Fire & Ice. 
 Was Fire & Brimstone not available? 
 (Emily) There comes a moment in each of our lives when the control that keeps us sane slips through our fingers. 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Fireworks whistling) 
 Most of us aim to seize it back. 
 (Popping and whistling) 
 The best way to fight chaos is with chaos. 
 (People speak indistinctly) 
 (Nolan) Why are we wasting time tearing apart an empty motel room? 
(Drawers clattering) 
 There's nothing here. 
 Amanda must have taken the box with her. 
 And left her phone behind? 
 She's not the one who stole it, Nolan. 
 Emily... 
 She didn't know where I kept the box. 
 And if she did, she wouldn't have done this to me. 
 She's too loyal. 
(Cell phone beeps and auto dials) 
 Who are you calling? 
 (Sighs) 
We're about to find out. 
 (Cell phone rings) 
 (Ring) 
 (Beeps) 
 Speak of the devil. 
 Or should I say the devil's daughter. 
 Your father had excellent penmanship, by the way. 
 Tyler. 
 I thought they locked you up. 
 I can't believe this. 
 Hey, Nolan. How's the arm? 
 What do you want, Tyler? 
 You know, I haven't decided yet. 
 Money would be nice. 
 But then again, so would vindication. 
 How's Danny? 
 Excited for the party tomorrow night? 
 You'll never get close enough to find out. 
 I'm crushed that you don't want me there. 
 Stay by your phone. 
 Oh, and if you do anything rash, like, uh, cancel the engagement party or call the cops, you can kiss your friend here good-bye. 
 (Whimpers and screams with muffled voice) 
 Amanda? 
 (Line disconnects, cell phone beeps) 
 Do me a favor. Next time you want to get a 17-year-old girl drunk, don't do it here. 
 None of this would've happened if you hadn't stuck your nose where it didn't belong. 
 And for what, some crazy girl you met for one summer a hundred years ago? 
 She set a dude's house on fire, Jack. 
 That guy deserved it. 
 And don't get me started on what the Graysons deserve. 
 Man, you're really losing it, you know that? 
 (Slams) 
 (Clicks) 
 (Beeps) 
 (Man) Sounds like your voice, Jack, so I'm guessing I got the right number. 
 This is Father Rick calling from Port-au-Prince. 
 Last time we spoke, you were busy settling your dad's affairs. 
 I hope that all worked out as best it could. 
 I'm calling because I received a hefty grant to raise a grade school and thought, if you were still interested, you might want to head up the project. 
 If your plate's still full, fine. 
 But this is an opportunity to do some real good, son. 
 It'd be great to have you down here. (Beep) (Slurps) Who would you rather sit next to the Paulsons or the Craigs? Oh, we're fiddling while Rome burns, are we? The Paulsons. The Craigs it is then. (Chuckles) 
Why are you still here, Conrad? To gloat? You already destroyed any chance I had at explaining myself to Charlotte. Congratulations. You win. Oh, not exactly. My father's threatened to oust me from the board if you and I can't reach a quiet settlement. You might have to answer to him, but I do not. And if it takes bloodying you on Wall Street to get what I'm owed, so be it. Well, who the hell are you to play hardball when your safety net just stormed out of the house tonight looking none to eager to ever speak with you again? Daniel will come back to me. He always does. (Sighs) (Lock clicks) (Door closes) (Daniel) There you are. Daniel. What are you doing? Waiting for you. Were you able to get a hold of Charlotte? She's with Declan. She didn't want to talk. She sounded drunk. Oh, I'm so sorry. (Jangles keys) (Cell phone buzzes) Is that her? (Inhales deeply) 
No. (Exhales) (Inhales and exhales) Your grandfather. Third one tonight. Daniel, he's grooming you to become the next C.E.O. of Grayson Global. That is huge. I don't even want to go to the engagement party tomorrow night let alone take over the family business. It's a really big deal. You should at least just sit down and hear what he has to say. Fine. But can't we just cancel the damn party? Trust me, nothing would make me happier. But hundreds of people are traveling hundreds of miles to be here. You're right. Just promise me one more time... No secrets of any kind, ever. You've seen what they've done to my family. (Kisses) 
Let's go to bed. It's late. I'm right behind you. (Whispers) All right. (Clatters) (Chain rattles) She's not who you think she is, you know? Yeah, she's you. And you're her. And her... And her, and her. And they call me crazy. I mean, she's not a bad person. 
(Scoffs) She does stuff to people, but it's for the right reasons. Really? Do you recognize this guy? Mason Treadwell. Victoria Grayson planted his interview tapes on me so she could frame me for arson. You mean the tapes that Emily copied and stashed away in her little box of secrets? (Case clatters) Victoria Grayson didn't frame you. Emily did. (Scoffs) That makes no sense. Why, because she's your soul mate, the sister you never had? Yes. Mm. Oh, look. 11 text messages on a phone that I presume used to be yours from one lovesick Jack Porter, none of which I'm guessing ever found their way to you. Emily's not your friend, Amanda. She's your competition. You need more proof? (Clatters) Have at it. (Sniffles) Charlotte, it's me. Your family's been calling nonstop. You gotta face 'em eventually. (Sighs) 
Where's your mouthwash? Uh, it's in the medicine cabinet. Listen, I... I got the number here of a therapist that my buddy went to after his mom died. Well, unfortunately, mine's alive and well. Obviously, losing your mother and finding out that your dad is not really your dad are two different things, but... I don't know. He said this lady was really helpful, so... I called the office, and they said she had a slot for you this afternoon. (Knocks on door) Charlotte, are you listening to me? Give me the number. (Paper rustles) (Ashley) 
Southampton Surveillance? It's Nolan's security detail. I figure, after everything that's happened this summer, it's better safe than sorry. And you owe me a favor. Why? Daniel wanted to cancel the party. No, I'd be ruined. Well, that's what I told him. Did he also tell you how much it would break his mother's heart or does it not matter to him anymore? Why don't I let you two chat, and I can talk about this with you later? Daniel is a fickle boy, Emily. 
(Chuckles) He loves to sit on fences. I hope when that fence is his opinion of his mother that I can trust you to be my advocate. Well, you haven't made that very easy for me. Well, I realize you and I have had our disagreements, to say the very least. But if you indeed plan on being part of this family, you need to know that... Blood will always be thicker than water. Meaning? Meaning that one day, you may or may not become Daniel's wife, but I will always be his mother. Daniel feels betrayed by you. If you want to rescue that relationship, you're going to have to earn back his trust. Would you facilitate that conversation? Well, that's up to Daniel. (Cell phone rings) Excuse me. (Ring) (People speaking indistinctly) (Cell phone beeps) This is Emily. (Tyler) Is it? I thought you'd like to know, Let's make a straight-up ransom deal. You bring a cashier's check to the South Strand parking structure at noon, and I'll bring your little box of secrets. What about Amanda? After we're done, she's... All yours. 
(Beep) (Beep) (Indistinct conversations) Hello, Grandpa. Hey. Thanks for coming. Sit. How's your sister doing? I bet her heart's in a million pieces right about now. Have you spoken with her? Not yet, no. But Declan made an appointment for her to go see someone. Someone? Yeah, a therapist over in Bridgehampton. Oh, good for her. So listen, I've got a job for you. See all of these names? These are the investors chirping the loudest about that rumored S.E.C. investigation and your father's marital woes. See the name at the top of the list? Satoshi Takeda. The good news is that he's here for your engagement party. And he has requested a private meeting with you this afternoon. So your job is to convince him to keep his money put. You have a problem with that? Your name's Grayson, Daniel. The name makes the decision for you. (Jack) I accepted Father Rick's offer. I set sail tonight, man. Man, this isn't about the fight we had earlier, right? Because I said I'm sorry, okay? Dec, it's not about that at all. I just... I just feel like my life has gone off track and I gotta... I gotta get it back, man. And I can't do that here. 
(Chuckles) Do you understand? Yeah, I do. It's been a weird summer. And you're nursing a heartache and some broken ribs. But, Jack, Haiti? It's not forever. It's just a couple of months. You'll be in school. Bull can take care of the bar. Look... I won't go. If you don't think you'll be okay... Ah, Jack, I'm gonna be fine. I'm just gonna miss you. (Sighs) (People speaking indistinctly) (Speaks indistinctly) Charlotte. So where are you off to in such a hurry, young lady? It wouldn't be to a therapist's office in Bridgehampton, now would it? Who told you that? Well, word gets around. But look, I understand how popular it is these days to kick back on a doctor's couch and purge your problems, but truth be known, more often than not, they cause more harm than good. How? If you were tell a stranger that your mother slept with a terrorist, and then that stranger decided to share that information, what do you think would happen to the family's reputation? When the Grayson name loses value... So does the company. Are you willing to gamble away your future for something like that? If it means not losing my mind, yeah. Well, what about Declan's future? What about Declan's future? I understand the kid flunked his entrance exam to Collins Prep. No surprise, I guess, but... From the Dean. Now I'm willing to make a call on the young man's behalf, but... Every  quid  deserves a  quo . You wouldn't happen to have that, uh, therapist's number on you, would you? (Exhales deeply) (Clears throat) (Phone rings) (Line clicks) (Beep) Miss Emily, I thought we had an agreement... (Clicks) 
Hands against the fence, Tyler. Yeah, okay, okay, okay. 
(Grunts) (Exhales) Where's my money? I'll let you know when I'm satisfied that everything's here. Where's Amanda? She can tell you herself when I'm satisfied that you brought my money. And the box? The box is in the trunk. Get Amanda on the phone. With pleasure. 
(Cell phone auto dials) You know, that Amanda is one loyal customer. Even after everything I showed her about how you played her for a fool, she still wouldn't believe me. You must have really done a number on her head. Hey, Mandy. Uh, I got your B.F.F. here. Let me talk to her. Yeah, go for it. She's actually right behind you. Who's the fool now? Amanda, Tyler is crazy. I don't know what lies he's told you, but you need to listen to me... No, you listen to me. I've sacrificed everything for you. I gave you my name. And what did you do? You took away the one thing in my entire life that meant anything to me. I had to protect Jack from all of this. I was talking about you and me. (Clears throat) Are we, uh, done being cathartic over there? Because we're wasting time. (Sighs) Amanda, don't do this. (Clinks) (Snaps) Good girl. 
(Clears throat) Start the car. The money. (Engine turns over) I wired the funds into an account at the Canadian National Bank. You're gonna have to go there to get it. Put that over there. (Engine idling) Perfect. (Clears throat) Have fun at the party tonight. (Car door opens) I hear there's gonna be fireworks. (Tires squeal) (Nolan) New gun? That was fast. (Clicks) So you're determined to turn this party into a funeral? I'm determined to be prepared for anything. You of all people should know how unpredictable Tyler can be. Well, then just cancel it, Ems. It's beyond that now. (Knock on door) (Door latch clicks) Hey. Hey. You got a minute? One midnight call from a Haitian benefactor, and bam, off you go? (Sighs) So when do you set sail? Tonight. (Sammy whines) I should've left months ago, but, well... Life gets in the way. It does mean I won't be able to make it to your party tonight. (Emily chuckles) Of course, after that last Graysons gathering, I don't think anyone's gonna miss me. So no word from Amanda then? Maybe I'm not supposed to hear from her. Maybe... Building this school is the universe's way of setting my priorities straight. (Sammy whines) You know, Amanda will come back when she's ready. And when she does, I'll make sure you're the first person she calls. What about Sammy? (Sammy whines) Ah, well, that's actually why I'm here. It's a long trip, and he's not exactly a puppy anymore. I don't know. The way he lights up when he's around you, I thought... I'd be happy to. You hear that, old man? 
(Sammy whining) Emily's gonna take you in. (Sammy pants) Back to where it all began. You be good now, you hear? (Pants) Well... Bye, Jack. Bye. (Sammy whines) Shut up. Bye. Go with him. Nolan... I am serious. Sail away. Fall in love. Go make little volunteer babies. You know I can't do that. At the beginning of the summer, you said you wanted to help me. If you meant it, you'll make sure he gets on that boat safely tonight. (Groans) 
Emily. Please. (Inhales deeply) Jack! Wait up! (Whispering) Sammy. Stay here. Stay here. What is this? This is the deed to Grayson Manor. And what about the shares of the company? (Laughs) I told you, they were a deal breaker. I'm not gonna relinquish Grayson Global, Victoria, not to you and not to my father. Daniel is gonna have his time at the head of the table. This is not that time. Settle now, and I'm gonna see to it that you get full cash value for all your shares. Well, at least tell me you're gonna think about it. (Cell phone buzzes and beeps) Hey. Hey, where have you been? You've been gone all day. Come on. About to step into a meeting with our old friend Takeda. Takeda? Really? He's back in town? And coming to the party. Hey, let me ask you something. These next couple of months, you have any commitments? Just you. Why? That's all I need to know. I'll see you in a bit. (Beep) 
 
 I'm sorry I'm late. (Woman speaks Japanese) (Speaks Japanese) Please. Actually, Mr. Takeda, I'm... I'm not staying. (Speaks Japanese) They sent me here to convince you that Grayson Global is the place to be... (Speaking Japanese) But if I can't convince myself to stay, how can I convince you? (Continues speaking Japanese) (Speaks Japanese) He said, I'm not sure I follow. I'm asking my fiancee to run away with me. (Speaking Japanese) And if she says yes, we'll leave tomorrow. (Continues speaking Japanese) (Speaks Japanese) This is a big decision. Very, and long overdue. (Speaks Japanese) I'll make sure someone from the office contacts you and answers any concerns you might have with my family's company. (Speaks Japanese) Now if you'll excuse me, I have some travel plans to make. (Speaks Japanese) (Cell phone rings) (Speaks Japanese) (Ring) (Ring) (Indistinct conversations) (Beep) (Indistinct conversations continue) (Man speaking Japanese) (Sighs) (Voice mail beeps) Ahh. How do I look? Under medicated. Ooh. I can assure you, I'm thinking quite clearly. Not as clearly as Emily. She's probably five steps ahead of you. Not this time. I know why I want payback. But why are you going through all this trouble to destroy her? Why not go be a millionaire in Canada? This was never about the money, Mandy. Then what? Does the name Frank Stevens mean anything to you? Should it? He worked for the Graysons. Emily bashed his skull in and then planted his wallet in my pocket for the cops to find. You think Emily killed that guy? Isn't it obvious? Why else would Emily frame me for it if not to distract attention from herself? (Sighs) So what, you're just gonna... Kill Emily? No. Emily's gonna kill Daniel. Or at least that's how it will appear to the cops. (Clunks) 
An eye for an eye. Now why don't you get dressed? You've earned yourself a front-row seat. Daniel's about to find out exactly how bad his taste in women really is. (Both speak indistinctly) Hi. You okay? (Indistinct conversations) Last-minute adjustments to your speech? A long-overdue adjustment to my life. I called your lawyer and I've agreed to your terms. I had her send over a messenger with the divorce papers. You were right, Conrad. It's time to end this. (Pen scratches paper) Rather poetic timing, don't you think? Mm. See you at the party. You couldn't have picked a better time to invest, George. Grayson Global's on track for the best quarter in history. Very impressive. Tick tock, Cinderella. Time's a-wasting. Mm. Suddenly you can't get to the party fast enough. The faster we get there, the faster it'll be over. And after it is, I have a surprise for you. Well, I have a surprise for you, too. Your mother asked me to facilitate a  detente  between you two. I'm sorry you got put in the middle of all this. Mm. It's what I signed up for. Come on. We're late. (Door opens) (Door closes) You don't like my taste in dresses? I'm not going to the party. Don't worry. I won't get in your way. I can't take that chance. (Gun clicks) It's your choice. Mm. (Grunts) 
Aah! (Groans) Aah! (Tyler groans) Ohh! 
(Groan) There they are, the future Mr. and Mrs. Grayson. Well, someone's in a good mood tonight. I could say the same about you. I'm engaged to the girl of my dreams. Why wouldn't I be? Well, if it isn't the guests of honor. Don't we look wonderful. You got a minute to talk? Of course, darling. (Indistinct conversations) Sweetheart, I know how upset you are about the misunderstanding we had regarding Charlotte. You mean how you led me to believe her real father raped you? I never said that. And if I had any idea that you had... The truth is that I loved David Clarke very much. God, Mom. Just stop. No, please. I need you to understand how much he meant to me. Save your breath. I'm not interested in anything else you have to say to me. After tonight, I'm done with you. I'm taking Emily to Paris. We'll get married and stay there until we choose the life we want to lead, one that doesn't involve Grayson Manor, Grayson Global, or anything Grayson. What does Emily have to say about this? Hmm? You haven't told her, have you? (Sighs deeply) What makes you think that she'll give up the Grayson name and everything that comes with it so easily? She's worked so hard for the privilege in just three months. What are you saying? I'm saying that I know the type. I was once just like her, ambitious, driven. Yes, by greed and insecurity. Emily is generous and decent. She's nothing like you. Well... We'll find out soon enough, won't we? But don't be surprised if she doesn't give your romantic delusions the warm response that you're hoping for. I certainly won't be. Well... 
 Bon voyage , my friend. Sensei. (Speaks Japanese) Yes. To guide your plan back to its righteous path. (Indistinct conversations) A gift. Is this... How did you get it? Your opponents are dangerous, but careless. What happened to Amanda and Tyler? Take the box. Bury your father's secrets away from here. When you return, your questions will be answered. (Video rewinds) Jack! Jack, wait. Amanda? My God. What are you doing here? What happened to you? I... I don't even know where to begin. Jack... I'm so sorry. Where are you going? Port-au-Prince. I'm following through with a plan I should've stuck with a long time ago. Take me with you. Amanda... I have so many questions. I know, and you deserve the answers, all of them. Take me with you, and I promise, I'll never leave you again. (Laughs) Hey. Hey. What are you doing out here? Just... getting some air. Come to Paris with me. What? I... I already bought the tickets. Let's just go. (Laughs) 
Daniel, that's crazy. The further away from my family we are, the more chance we have of doing this right. I can't. My life is here. Our lives are here. Running away isn't the answer. Well, sometimes, it's the only answer. There's nothing for me here but secrets and lies. I'm here. And why is that exactly? What... Why do you want to marry me, Emily? Because I love you. Then come away with me. Where is this coming from? Did your mother say something? Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, she did. And you know what? She was right. Daniel, come back. Thanks, Skipper. Nolan called me that. He was kinda my, uh, my half Gilligan, half Professor. Nolan wasn't exactly fond of me. No one in this town is. Except Emily. Everyone told me to stay away from you but her. Even as I was getting ready to take off, to sail away, she told me not to give up on you. Just to follow my heart. Hopefully one day, you'll get to know her better. (Car horn honks) (Honk) I, um... I still owe... owe the guy his fare. (Chuckles) Sure. Here. Hurry back. I love you. Amanda? Hurry. Go. Go! Amanda! Big Ed. Will you hang on to this for me? Okay, boss. Thanks. Emily. I've been looking everywhere for you. Where's Daniel? He's walking the beach. We're having a thing. Same thing or different thing? Same thing. Nice night for it. Nice night for what, Nolan? Celebrating. You shouldn't be here. Ah, that makes two of us. 
(Chuckles) Ems... It's okay. Jack is gone. She's not worth it. Hello, Danny. Do you remember your birthday party when I asked your father to tell me the truth about David Clarke? What's your point? I never got to finish the story. I already know how it ends. Clarke slept with my mother. Charlotte's his daughter. That's not the ending of the story, Danny. That's just the beginning. Here. See for yourself. What's this? Why don't we call your fiancee and ask her? I did, after all, find it underneath her living room floorboards. She's been playing you, brother. She's playing all of us. (Cell phone beeps) You know, on second thought, allow me to do the honors. Let's take a walk down to the shore. 
(Beep) Shall we? (Indistinct conversations) Charlotte. Is everything okay? Couldn't be better. I've got it. Charlotte? Charlotte. Hey, didn't mean to leave you stranded. No problem. Oh, she'll come around. My children always do. Thank you for the  tete-a-tete  with Daniel. I'm glad it went well. Well, he told me about his secret plan for the two of you. And seeing as that you're not on a plane to Paris, I can only assume that you talked some sense into the boy. Stay right here, won't you? And allow me to properly show you my gratitude. (Cell phone chimes) (Beeps) (Beep) Hey, you really want out of that tux? Yes. (Driver) I just dropped a young lady off on Further Lane in Southampton, and I'm headed back now. Amanda! (Gunshot) Amanda! (Gunshots) No, no, no, no! (Fireworks whistling and popping) Amanda! Oh, my God. What did you do? Jack, I... I can't... I... I didn't... Go. My truck's up the road. The keys are inside. You have to go. Now. (Whistling and popping continues) (Thuds) (Declan) Where are we going? (Charlotte laughs) 
You ask too many questions. (Laughs) 
Show me what you got, bad boy. Here. I'll help you. I got it. I got it. Okay. Ready to go? Yeah. Oh, come on. Keys. Fire and ice. When we first sat down to discuss tonight's occasion, I was immediately taken by the idea of an evening inspired by primal bookends... Fire and ice, beginnings and endings, and the love between a man and a woman. (Laughter and applause) (Cell phone beeps and auto dials) (Phone rings) (Cell phone rings) (Ring) Yo, yo, 8 mile, private party here! (Ring) (Victoria speaking indistinctly with amplified voice) (Cell phone rings) 
(Victoria) Starry evening... That creep better not be taking pictures. (Ring) (Victoria continues speaking indistinctly) Hey! (Ring) You got a problem? (Victoria) Tonight not only marks the final weekend of a truly remarkable summer in the Hamptons, it is also the engagement of my son Daniel to the lovely and beguiling Miss Emily Thorne. And though we've only known Emily for a few short months, she already feels like a piece of the family puzzle we never even knew was missing. In a word... I approve. (Guests laugh) And as anyone can tell you, approval is not something I give away freely. (All laugh) (Lowered voice) 
Where the hell is my son? Mom! Mom! Mom! My brother... Somebody come here! (Guests murmuring indistinctly) (Charlotte) Come here! Daniel? (Murmuring continues) (Victoria) Daniel! (Emily) Chaos... By its very definition cannot be controlled. Hey. My, uh, truck broke down. Is there a chance you can give me a ride? Thank you. It is an honor to be of service. (Emily) Once introduced, all order and intention is rendered useless. (Victoria) Daniel! Daniel! Get away from my son! Daniel! Daniel, baby, please. (Crying) 
Daniel, w... wake up. Please. Baby, please! Daniel! It's Tyler. Oh, my God. (Man) We need to give them some room, okay? Stand back, please. (Daniel) Mom? (Emily) The outcome of chaos can never be predicted. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (Cries) (Emily) 
The only certainty it brings... I... (Whispers) Don't say a word. (Emily) Is the devastation it leaves in its wake.
