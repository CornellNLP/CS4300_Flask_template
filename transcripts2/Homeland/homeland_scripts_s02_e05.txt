 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan :  This relentless pursuit of terror. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... 
 Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. 
 This was an act of terrorism. 
 It was a despicable and cowardly act. 
 The next samba we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. 
 ...until something stops him. 
 Carrie :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. 
 Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. 
 Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? f*ck! Carrie :  I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Previously on Suicide bomber almost blew up Vice President Walden. He made a tape. My name is Nicholas Brody. So you want to follow Brody? Surveillance equipment, a few good men. And Carrie. And Carrie. But I'm sending you a guy. Peter Quinn. Brody has a meeting this morning at the CIA, and we want to throw him a jolt. Which is you. Are you back here? Yeah, in a way. Carrie Mathison was at the CIA. Renew the relationship. Could be useful, actually. I'm sorry for all you went through. I mean, f*cking ECT? Where'd you hear that? Was it terrible? No. He made me. Peter : No way. He's on his way up to his room. He's acting totally normal. We have to go in. He's on to me. Your work is done tonight. Get the f*ck back here. Saul : Oh, what is she doing? It reeks, you know. You still have your twisted theories about me, don't you? Not theories anymore. Get down, get down now! You're a disgrace to your nation, Sergeant Nicholas Brody. You're a traitor and a terrorist, and now it's time you pay for that. (heavy door slams) David... Not a word. (keypad beeping) What the hell happened? I thought this was a surveillance operation. It was until Carrie took it upon herself to break cover and confront him. We had no choice but to move in. She says Brody made her. Did he? No. It's possible. I don't know. Neither does he. What I do know is we've got to get Brody to tell us what he knows before Nazir's people realize he's missing. I agree. I figure we got 24 hours, tops. After that, you have to figure they go to ground or pick a new target. And we lose our best shot at stopping an attack on America. So, who goes in there and talks to him? Carrie. Are you sh1tting me? She knows Brody better than anyone here. She's the only one who knows him up close and personal. She is way too emotional, reckless. I don't know what they've told you, but Brody made me, I swear. I had no choice. Peter's going to take a whack at him. With all due respect, David, that's a mistake. You can go home now. Let her stay. She can help. She's forgotten more about Brody and Nazir than we'll ever know. But, Carrie, this is Peter's show. Clear? I'll run interference on Brody's office. (door closes) I should be in there, Saul. You're lucky you're in the building. You're in the custody of the Central Intelligence Agency. I'd like to ask you a few questions. I'm a United States congressman. You can't just kidnap me and shackle me to the f*cking floor. Actually, we can. Thanks to you and your colleagues in congress, we have fairly broad powers to detain and interrogate. Look, I've been down this road before. I'm not what Carrie says I am. Ask David Estes-- he'll tell you. By Carrie, you mean Carrie Mathison? Yes. And what exactly does she think you are? A terrorist. And you're not? No, I'm not. You should know that everything that you say in here will be used against you in your trial. You should also know that you are facing a possible death sentence. I want a lawyer. Well, life is full of disappointments. I want a f*cking lawyer! (Brody breathing heavily) After your capture in 2003, you were subjected to a period of five years of profound and constant torture. (sighs) It says here, (clears throat) "Brutally beaten, electricity, isolation and worse." Am I getting things right so far? It is important that we're accurate. (panting) Hmm? Hmm. Why did the torture stop? I'm completely off the grid here, aren't I? Why did the torture stop? I don't know. Who was Issa? Issa? Issa was one of my guards. I told Carrie that already. Was he the reason the torture stopped? I have no idea. Were you aware that Abu Nazir's youngest son was also named Issa? I didn't know that, no. You've never met the boy? No. Were you aware that he was killed at his madrassa during an American drone strike? I wasn't, no. Hmm. He's setting the table with Brody's lies. He's good. Peter : In your debrief, you indicate that you have never met Abu Nazir. Yet Carrie Mathison's addendum to your file contradicts that. Well, she's lying. Why would she do that? Because she's out of her f*cking mind. Because she's obsessed with me. Peter : Is it also a lie that while in captivity, you converted to Islam? Yes. Do you have any idea why, on the morning of December 17, Thomas Walker shot and killed Elizabeth Gaines? I assume it was because he was trying to kill the vice president. So he missed? Apparently. The best shot in your unit? It happens. You want to hear my theory? My theory is Elizabeth Gaines was killed in order to instigate Secret Service protocols, which it did. Everybody was herded together into the State Department panic room without security checks. 27 of our best and brightest, all crowded on in there with you, who was wearing a bomb. A... Where the f*ck would I get a bomb? So you weren't wearing a bomb? No. You didn't know Abu Nazir's son? No. And you did not conspire to assassinate the vice president? Of course I didn't. I've got something I'd like you to watch. (papers rustling) My name is Nicholas Brody, and I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps. I have a wife and two kids, who I love. I'll be right back. By the time you watch this, you'll have read a lot of things about me, about what I've done. That's why I wanted to explain myself. (door closes) So that you'll know the truth. On May 19, 2003, as part of a two-man sniper team serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom... Let him suck on that. Neatly done. When the tape ends, we'll let him stew for a while. No sleep. ...where I was held captive for more than eight years. What hotel? I'm not sure. For how long? I'm not sure. Are you guys getting a divorce? No, we're..e're just giving each other some breathing room. What does that mean? It means we're trying very hard to work things out. Work what out? Our problems. (sighs) I'll see you guys at 5:00. It's pizza night. Is Dad really coming back? Yeah, he's coming back. How do you know? Because I know, Chris. Hey. Hi. Are you okay? Who broke his heart? My mother. What'd she do? Throw away his Xbox? No, she, uh, threw our father out of the house. Oh. My mother does that once a month. My dad sleeps in the guest wing for a week, she swears she's done with him for good, next thing I know, they're drinking martinis and listening to  My Fair Lady. (chuckles) My therapist says it's pretty common, but... You have a therapist? (chuckles) I had a therapist. Once. So, um, I talked to Xander. Home guy? Yeah, well, the former home guy. Oh. Take me out tonight? Okay. How about a movie? Yeah? Yeah. Once Upon a Time in America  is playing at Dupont Circle. Sergio Leone. I have absolutely no idea who that is. (chuckles) He's a great Italian filmmaker who specializes in wide-screen agony. Greg : What do you mean, he's not answering his phone? He has to answer his phone; he's a congressman. He can't just disappear. What about his wife? She's not answering, either? Jesus. Greg Merriles, did I pronounce that right? Yes. My name is David Estes. I work for the Central Intelligence Agency. I know who you are, sir. Congressman Brody is helping us out on a matter of national security. He is? It's imperative that no one, including his family, questions his absence. How long will he be helping you? A few days. A few days? That's going to be tricky. His-his schedule's jam-packed. Committee meetings, uh, interviews galore. He's at the vice president's beck and call. I think the safest thing would be to say that he has the flu. There's a nasty strain going around right now. Tell anybody who asks he's staying at the Ashford. Why would he be staying at the Ashford? He and his wife are in the middle of a conjugal spat. That's actually the truth. It is? Huh. Why don't I know that? Just reassure her that he's fine, that his doctor has seen him and that all will be well. Call me if there's a problem. Hey, this is Nicholas Brody. Please leave a message. (beep) Brody, it's me. Call me back. (door opening) Listen to this. Jessica : Brody, it's me again. Please call me back. The kids are freaked. I'm freaked, to be honest. We need to talk. She's called three times. So, what do you say we start over? Who was Issa? Abu Nazir's son. Not your guard? No. In fact, you knew Issa. He was your student. You taught him English. Yes. And you came to love him as if he were your own son. Yes, I did. Peter : He was killed in a drone strike ordered by the highest levels of government. (sighs) He was killed in a drone strike ordered by the vice president of the United States. Who you called a war criminal. Because he is. Truth is, you returned from captivity in Iraq intent on killing him. Yes. Which is why, on the morning of December 17, wearing a suicide vest, you conspired to get yourself next to the vice president in the State Department panic room. No. What do you mean, no? I wasn't wearing a vest. I made a tape. That's all. You're lying to me again. Brody : I was fucked-up. I was angry. But ask yourself, what really happened? Nothing. Nothing? Tell that to Elizabeth Gaines and the two Secret Service agents who lost their lives on the steps of the State Department. I had nothing to do with that. Do you really expect anyone to believe that after watching this? Believe what you want. No bomb went off. I killed no one. You've got nothing on me. No real evidence at all. Do you really want to do this? What? This. Play games. Because I can play, too. What do you think Jessica will say when I show her your confession? I think she'll be glad I didn't go through with it. I think she'll understand that I was unhinged by everything that's been done to me, everything I've been through. She's a very understanding woman. And... Dana? Is she as understanding? What about Chris? How old is he now? 12? What do you think the rest of their lives will look like? My dad, the jihadist murderer. I'll take my chances. Go ahead and show them. We know Abu Nazir is going to hit us in retaliation for Israel's bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. You were part of his American terrorist cell. No, I wasn't. When is the strike going to occur? I don't know. What's the target? (sighs) I don't know. What... is the target? I don't know. (screaming) That jog your memory, you f*cking asshole? Jesus f*cking Christ! When's the attack?! (gasps) Talk, you m*therf*cker! You will talk to me, Brody, goddamn it. Get the f*ck off of me! What the f*ck is the matter with you?! This is my interrogation! Get him out of here. Brody, I will f*ck you. f*ck you! (panting) We should go. No, I'm not going anywhere. (gasps, yells) (Brody gasps, Carrie sighs) (panting) I can do this, Saul. It's my turn. (Brody groans) (panting) I'm sure he isn't here. He hasn't been around since yesterday. I just want to see for myself. Of course. Yesterday. 
 
 Hi, Betsy. Is Greg there? (phone rings) What's up? I'm at the Ashford. No Brody, no flu. I even brought him chicken noodle soup. Ugh. Not there? Really? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. So where is he? Well, don't worry. I'll find him. You do that, and you tell him to call me. As you can see here, here and here, Israeli jets weren't able to penetrate the deeper bunkers. (cell phone buzzing) The Iranians hardened the roof with reinforced concrete, and then they covered it with... Estes. She knows. Who is this? Greg Merriles. Jessica Brody is all over my ass looking for her husband. She knows I'm bullshitting her. Uh, we need a little more time. Let me speak to Brody. He's busy right now. I'll wait. I'll have him call you back. (phone beeps off) f*ck. (door opens and closes) You broke my heart, you know. Was that easy for you? Was that fun? Because of you, I questioned my own sanity. I had myself committed to a mental institution. I lost my job, too. I lost my place in the world. I lost everything. I just told Estes the truth. You were harassing my family. The truth? Bullshit. You came this close to blowing him into a million pieces. Did you tell him that? I didn't wear a bomb. (panting) Did you even think about me when you went to Estes? Tell me you at least felt a.. pang of regret, a teeny little sliver of guilt. You said before that I'm obsessed with you. You really think that? Yeah, I do. So it's a one-way street? You have no feelings for me? Go ahead. I'm a big girl. I can take it. Come on, Brody. Look me in the eye and tell me you felt nothing up in that cabin. I'm sorry I hurt you. (laughs) "Hurt" doesn't quite cover it. So did you? Did you..id you feel anything? Oh, for Christ's sake, Carrie, we were playing each other. No, I wasn't. Not the whole time, anyway. I-I remember thinking I was exactly where I belonged. I know what you're doing. And it's not going to work. I'm just happy to be talking to you again. Are you thirsty? (sighs) Water, please? What you did with the knife, losing your temper-- that was all theater? Wasn't it? Every good cop needs a bad cop. (sighs) (sighs) What the f*ck is she doing? Just listen. (whispers): Alone at last. Carrie : Here, let me get these off you. (Brody sighs) (sighs) (long sigh) Can I ask you something? I have a choice? You said up at the cabin that you didn't have anyone to talk to. Did you... did you ever find anybody? A friend? A therapist? No. You never went back to that support group, did you? No. Why? I don't know. (long sigh) People always ask me about the war. You know..as it as bad as everyone says? I-I never know what to tell them. (laughs) "My interpreter was burned alive and then hung from a bridge"? No one survives intact. No. Do you still have nightmares? (sighs) Sometimes I shake uncontrollably for no reason at all. So what do you say..hen people ask you what it was like over there? As little as possible. But if they insist? I lie. Tell them stories they want to hear. It's the lies that undo us. It's the lies we think we need to survive. When was the last time you told the truth? About five minutes ago when I said I didn't wear a bomb. You never wore a bomb? No. But you did make a suicide tape. Who did you give it to? I didn't give it to anyone. I threw it in the trash. And yet it wound up in Beirut in a Hezbollah commander's house? See? You're drowning in lies. I'm surprised you can even keep them straight anymore. Walden lied to the whole f*cking world about the drone strike! Yes, he did. But you're not like him, are you? You're not a monster. No. Are you sure you're not a monster, Brody? I'm sure. But Abu Nazir is. His pattern is to target innocent civilians and inflict mass casualties. Kenya, 1998, a busy marketplace. Madrid, 2004, a packed commuter train. Last spring, a department store in Amsterdam. He doesn't strike soldiers and high-ranking murderers like Walden. He kills wives..nd children. Danas and... Chrises and Jessicas. I know that you think that he was kind to you, that he saved you, but the truth is..e systematically pulled you apart, Brody..iece by piece until there was nothing left but pain. And then he relieved the pain and he put you back together again as someone else. He gave you a boy to love, and then that other monster, Walden, took that boy away. Between the two of them, they made your life a misery. Wouldn't it be a relief to stop lying? For instance, if I stopped lying, I could say to you, "Brody... I want you to leave your wife and children and be with me." (laughs) There, I said it. I'm still alive. It feels good. Try it. You're a good man, Brody. You're a good man... ...because you didn't explode the vest you were wearing. Right? (whispers): I wasn't wearing a vest. You decided not to kill those people. You decided to let Walden live. Even Walden. Dana called you, didn't she? Carrie : While you were there in the panic room with Walden. She used my cell. What did she say? She asked me to come home. I said I would. And I did. It was hearing Dana's voice that changed your mind, wasn't it? (pants) She asked you to come home, and you did. Why? Maybe because... Maybe because you suddenly understood that killing yourself and ruining Dana's life wouldn't bring Issa back. Maybe because you knew then how much you loved your own child. Maybe because you were just sick of death. That's the Brody I'm talking to. That's the Brody that knows the difference between warfare and terrorism. That's the Brody I met up in that cabin. That's the Brody I fell in love with. What is Abu Nazir's plan? I don't know. But there is a plan, right? To attack America? Yes. Who does know the plan? Uh, Roya Hammad, maybe. I'm not sure. Roya Hammad? Who gave you the suicide vest? A tailor from Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. What's his name? Bassel something. Is there anyone else in Nazir's network that you've had contact with? There was Afzal Hamid. Al Zahrani, the... Saudi attaché. (sighs) And Tom Walker. All dead. (whispers): All dead. (exhales) (long exhale) (door opens) We need you to call your wife. Reassure her that you're okay. That you'll be home..ater tonight. When's Finn picking you up? Soon. Are you excited? It's just a date, Mom. (phone ringing) Hello? Hey, it's me. Brody. Just checking in. How are you? Where have you been? Looking for some answers. Did you find any? Yeah, I think so. How are the kids? They miss their father. We need to talk, Brody. I'll come by the house. When? Tonight. Jess, don't worry. We're going to be fine. (beep) Your father's coming home. Sure he is. Saul : Okay. Easy. (panting) (groans) (panting) (insects chittering, chirping) Well, you look nice. I combed my hair. Well, then you look beautiful. Did you tell Xander you're seeing Finn? Yeah, I-I told him. I figured it would just be too creepy otherwise. Or just be wrong otherwise. I'm proud of you. It is kind of weird, though. I mean, me dating the boss's son. It's not weird at all. Anyway, Vice President Walden isn't Dad's boss exactly. They're colleagues. Mmm. I'm sorry about all the confusion. I know your dad and I are supposed to be the grown-ups. It's... whatever. Dad changed over there. They did something to him. They did. (car approaching) There he is. Hi, Mrs. Brody. Hi, Finn. Get her back safe and sound. Yes, ma'am. (door locks) (gasps) Brody, we need to go over your options. Here's what you're facing.. trial with all the attendant publicity, followed by a long prison sentence. You'll bring dishonor and shame to yourself, the Marine Corps, the country and your family. Or..ou help us, and all of that goes away. Help you how? We send you back into the world as if nothing happened. You help us figure out what Abu Nazir's plan is. No trial? No charges, no trial. Jess and the kids? They'll never know. You quit politics, move to the town of your choice somewhere far, far away. Immunity? You guys don't have the power to give me that. You better hope we do. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ You okay? Let's have some fun. Hmm, fun. You want to have some fun, huh? (tires squealing) Oh, sh1t! (tires squealing, horns honking) (laughing) Yeah! Faster. Faster! Okay. All right. Yeah! Okay. (laughing) (screaming) Stop! Finn, stop! Oh, f*ck! You got to turn around! You got to go back there! f*ck! Come on. Dana, please! If anyone finds out about this, my life is over! Well, we at least have to call 911! No. They can trace the call. See? She's fine, Dana, okay? He's calling 911. There's nothing we can do about it. Finn, we almost killed someone! Dana, I'm begging you, let's just get out of here. My dad is the vice president of the United States. (moaning): Oh, f*ck me. Okay. Okay. Go. I assume you've spoken to Roya about me. She was the one who suggested I reestablish the relationship. Good. So if she comments on your absence, - just tell her you were with me. With you? Tell her we couldn't keep our hands off each other. The affair will be our cover going forward. If you need me for whatever reason, you just call and say you miss me. I'll do the same. We'll meet at my apartment. (sighs) So Walden just stands there and gets elected president? He could lose. Abu Nazir will find out I'm working for you. No, he won't. Not if we're careful. When he does, he'll go after my family. That's how he operates. We'll protect your family. (sighs) ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ The last time I went on a bender was when you went to the prom with Billy Birkbeck instead of me. I was 17 years old. Where's your car? I left it outside a bar in Fairfax. I took a cab. How's the flu? Greg just made that up. Don't blame him. He was just doing his job. I'd like your permission to come home. Okay. But I need the truth, Brody. That was the deal. If you want to come back, I need to know what is going on with you. And don't give me any bullshit about a bender and Billy Birkbeck. No more secrets. Can it wait until the morning? No, it can't. Okay. You're going to think this is a little crazy, Jess. I'm working for the CIA. The CIA? Yep. Doing what? Helping out on matters of national security. Brody, if this is some more bullshit... It's not. I swear to God. It's the truth. I can't tell you any more right now. I shouldn't have told you this much already. (front door opens) You're home early. What's the matter? Nothing. What happened to you? Chris : Hey, Dad. Are you back? Yeah. Yeah, I'm back. Good night. ♪ ♪
