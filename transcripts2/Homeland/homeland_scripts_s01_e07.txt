 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe, the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan : This relentless pursuit of terror. President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... Reporter :  The  USS Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. This was an act of terrorism. It was a despicable and cowardly act. The next song we're going to play for you  is one of the good old favorites. Until something stops him. Woman :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (Speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? God! Carrie :  f*ck! I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Previously on  Homeland... You still haven't produced a single lead connecting Sergeant Brody to any plot against America. You need to take down that surveillance. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, I know you. We're on to the next case. Find this man, Raqim Faisel. He followed me to this house. No one knows we're living here. I still think we should leave. Someone must have found out about the house. How? I don't know. We should turn ourselves in. No! Three days ago you were about to tell your kids. I mean, we were talking about moving in together. He's my husband, Mike. You were my friend! (grunting) Hey, if you don't slow down, I'm never gonna be able to catch up. (both moaning) Man : Have you ever been unfaithful to your wife? No. He's lying. He passed the polygraph. Get in. (tires squeal) (car door shuts) (baby fussing) Help you? Ticket to Mexico. Lot of cities in Mexico. Tampico? Leon? The next bus to Mexico, whatever that is. (baby crying) Beaumont to Monterrey. Transfer in Nuevo Laredo... Sounds like a winner. So, why am I here? I don't know. You just got in my car. Well, I couldn't have gotten in if you didn't stop for me. True. So, did I pass? The polygraph? Yeah. Flying colors. So you won't be hauling me in again next week? Not that I know of. I'm taking some time..rom home. From Jess. Is that right? She was f*cking someone. I'm sorry. So what exactly are we doing? Well, I'd like a drink. Or three. All right, swanky or hole-in-the-wall? I don't like the word "hole" anymore. Right. But I do like a good dive. The more I drink, the worse I play. That's not happening to you. I know. Pissed off all my college boyfriends, too. All of them? Both of them. f*ck me. Two out of three? Buy me another, you're on. Cuervo? Tequila Revolucion, silver, no lime. You like your clear liquors. What's up, chief? You want a ride? I got one. What, Opie over there? "88," huh? Yeah, it's my jersey number from high school. Or code for HH. Eighth letter of the alphabet. "Heil Hitler." You're not just a pretty face, are you? You guys are White Nation, huh? That's cool. It's Aryan pride, baby. So what's the plan? Like, world domination? Yeah, that's right. Any time soon? You wanna hear about it? You can come outside. We got a van. Hell, yeah. I love sucking Nazi dick. You know, I don't like people f*cking with me. Well, who does? Who  does  like people f*cking with them? Hey, is there a problem? Yeah, the problem is this mouthy bitch. Hey, look, are we okay here? Huh? So is there, like, a supremacist fist bump? What are you, a f*cking moron? Bitch! Oh, God! Get those fuckers! Oh, sh1t! You f*cking lunatic! (Carrie laughs) I gotta unlock it. Open it! Okay, get in. It's open. f*ck you, bitch! Here they come. Go! (men yelling indistinctly) (laughs) You are a dangerous f*cking drunk. Thanks. It's not a compliment! My hand! (laughing) Okay, okay, where now? I have a cabin..r my family does. I've been meaning to get there. Sounds like the stars have aligned. I-95. Hit it! (Brody laughing) Final touches, hon. All smooth. There. You're done. Dana, you're up. So, I'm thinking layers. Like, maybe really cut it to my shoulders or something. Okay. Where's Dad? He's taking the weekend away. Why? Dana... He knows about you and Mike. Yeah. Jesus, Ma. Dana, I thought I was a widow. Our situation was very unusual. Yeah, so you gave up on him and went whoring out with his best friend. You cannot talk to me like that! And now, Mom, it's royally f*cked up! Enough with the language and the attitude! Or what? Or you're grounded. Yeah, right. Starting right now! The whole weekend, you're home. I got a line on our runaway terrorist. The one whose boyfriend got iced in the motel? She stole a car outside of Columbus last night. Just turned up in Beaumont, Texas. Woman fitting her description bought a one-way bus ticket, cash. Due to cross the border late tonight. We believe Nazir's people killed her boyfriend Faisel, and I think she'll give them up. Texas agents can intercept the bus. I want to go. You want to go to Mexico? Bring her back myself. One-on-one. You can talk to her here. Put her in a room with a bunch of suits, she'll go silent. David, I get this girl. I've spent the last three days figuring her out. I can get her to talk. FBI's gotta escort you. Fine, as long as they keep their f*cking distance. David..rust me. Wow, I like it. Yeah, it's old school. No A.C., build your own fire, like that. (grunts) Yeah, it's perfect. Where is the f*cking key? (phone rings) Hello. Maggie, it's me. Hi. Um, hey, just curious, which rock do we keep the cabin key under? You're at the cabin? Uh, no, I'm home. Just wondering about the key. Carrie, what's going on? Uh, nothing. Nothing at all. You were supposed to come over tonight and get your meds. Uh, Monday. Gonna do that Monday. You don't have a pill for tomorrow or Sunday. No, I have one left. I'm fine. You sound drunk. (snorts) Drunk? (laughs) I am, actually, at the cabin With who? Uh, no, I'm all alone. I'm meditating. Okay, well, look, take your pill tomorrow and then come over Sunday night. No skipping. Okay, promise. Okay. Uh, so, the key? It's in the old stove. (gasps) Right! Stupid. I remember. Okay, um, thanks. Hey, look, I'm at the open house at the girls' school, but... Oh, great. Have fun. I'll drop everything and leave if you're in trouble. Okay, I'll see you Sunday. Okay. Everything okay? Yeah. Wait. Wait here. (key jingles) (keys jangling) (sighs) What you looking at? A star. Wait an hour. You'll see thousands. I just need one. I'd ask you what you were wishing for, but... What? How would I know if you were telling the truth? Oh, the polygraph. "Have you been faithful to your wife, Sergeant Brody?" (chuckling) "Yes, I have." (both laugh) And hours before, I was climbing all over you. Did you learn that over there? The climbing? No. How to beat the box. Well, I had to lie sometimes to save my life. Maybe I became an expert. How'd you resist cooperating? I mean, you're in a hole. They're beating you. Carrie, I don't want to talk about it. Sorry. (clears throat) You're a pretty good drinking buddy. (laughing): I got a little carried away with the Nazis. (chuckles) Well, I figure we're safe here. Yeah, unless my sister sends in the dogs. I've been thinking about you. Yeah? And last night. Mmm. Parking lot s*x. Classy. Can we graduate to cabin s*x? Ow. Brody : Okay. (grunts, laughs) (Speaking spanish) Last stop, Nuevo Laredo. ♪ ♪ (Speaking Spanish) Hands up! Hands up! (In Spanish)- To the ground! To the ground! Come here! To the gound! (Speaking Spanish)  Easy, easy.. (Speaking Spanish) Here! Here! Slowly! (Speaking Spanish) Easy, easy, easy. Hi, Aileen. Who are you? Your ride. (Speaking Spanish) How did you get out of the truck? Unless you prefer the Federales. (Speaking Spanish) Let's go,  gringuita . Yes, we have company. In case you try to bolt, the Feds are there. Of course, I told them you weren't dumb enough to do that. So we're headed to McLean, Virginia. Should take us 30 hours. I got what they call a heavy foot, so maybe 25. And then I turn you over. To the FBI. Who, frankly, are chomping on the bit to put you away, Aileen. See, they frown on terrorists. And, in particular, privileged wealthy American terrorists. I'm looking forward to the drive, actually. I've had some upheaval at home. Could use some peace, quiet. You're obliging me with that, so thank you. I'll just say this. We could talk things out, you and I. Come to an understanding. But once we get to D.C., the Feds step in and I move on. And how you're treated and what you're charged with-- All that-- It's quite out of my hands. So... food for thought. (sighs) (Brody sighs) (groans) Morning. (groans) Morning. God, it's so nice down here. Yeah. (sighs) I overdid it last night. Me, too. No more booze today. No. (grunts) (sighs) Look... I know. This was crazy. I should call home. Yeah. I should go home, actually. Sure. Okay. We can head back. I love the water. Mm. There's actually a really beautiful waterfall out there. My sister and I would hike to it every day in the summer, take our compasses and notebooks, play Lewis and Clark. (sighs) Saul :  Not only did your cohorts turn on you and blow away your boyfriend... Faisel was your boyfriend, right? Not only that. Now they're after you. You're as safe as you've been in two days riding with me. What was the plan, Aileen? Why'd you buy that house under the flight path? Tell me that. And tell me who's out there working on Plan B. Then I can help you. Bullshit. Huh. She speaks. (speaks Arabic) Must have learned Arabic growing up. Riyadh, right? I know those compounds. Rich oilmen and their families, blocking out the world with those great walls, living like desert kings. The pools, the gardens. Never mind the desperate people outside the walls. The guest workers..imping along the road. Kids with no shoes, shirts. Kids like Faisel. You met there, right? As kids? He was 13; you were 15? Somehow, between you being shuttled to that fancy American school and him laboring each day for $1.10 a week, you and Faisel found each other. He had a horse. We'd ride. Did you love him then, or did that come later? You don't know me. Brody : So were you Lewis or Clark? Carrie : Oh, had to be Lewis. Why? I like the name Meriwether. (laughs) So you were an adventurer even as a kid? Yeah, I never really fantasized about New York or a corner office. It was always, like, Nepal or Uganda. How long were you in Baghdad? A couple three-year stints. What happened out there? What didn't happen? What sent you to that support group? I lost someone. My translator. Were you with him? Uh, he was protecting me. Trying. But this mob just got crazy. And they hung him from a bridge. I was..inned down. I couldn't... Yeah. It's hard to find people to talk to about it. How about your wife? It's like she doesn't know who I actually am now. Well, maybe it just takes time. I... I can't be with her. No? No, I just... (clears throat) I just can't. But I can with you. (chuckling): Well, we were drinking heavily. No, but it's different with you. It's, uh... (clears throat) I don't know. It's free. As in, I don't charge? (laughs) As in, it's the first time since I've been back that... well, I found some f*cking peace. Yeah. Me, too, actually. And that's pretty rare for me. So... Are we gonna try this sober? Uh, waterfall's just up here. Maddie : Concentration. Okay, so your word must begin with the last letter of the word before it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go. Okay. (chanting): Concentration, concentration is the game. Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm just the same. Subject. Boys' names. Xander. Raphael. Liam. Mike. (coughs) Drink! For the tenth time. You suck at this game. (chuckles) All right! Come on, come on. (chanting): Concentration, concentration is the game... All right, forget this, forget this. Let's go out. Yeah? No, I'm grounded. Your mom's working all day. She'll never know. No! Hey. Whoa, whoa. Wild thing, slow down. Jeff : Let's go to the quarry. Yeah. Yes. No, guys, just let me... Get some more beer. (gasps) Oh, my God. You okay? f*ck. I didn't feel anything. Come here. One of you get a towel for her right f*cking now. Maddie : Oh, my God. 30 miles to Memphis. You been to Graceland? No? You got to go once in your life. See the Jungle Room. Stay at the Heartbreak Hotel. My dad thought Elvis was the devil. Hoover thought he was a national security threat. Like minds. Saul : We've been in touch with him. Your dad. I haven't. I know. Six long years. Thank you. Fries? No. He's worried about you. He's worried about what their friends will think. That their good little Princeton girl was shacked up with a poor brown Saudi, and planning to give their beloved U.She "f*ck you" it deserves. Do you realize how serious this is? You could end up with the death penalty. What do you care? Why are you here, anyway? The FBI could've delivered me. That would have been standard, right? I thought we'd understand each other. Why? You were isolated growing up. Right? Well, there was the compound community. If you like immoral businessmen. So you went outside the walls. Found Faisel. And then it was okay. There was something good there. But then my father saw us one day. Riding that horse. His princess cavorting with a local brown boy. Aileen? Is Faisel the reason you were shipped off to boarding school? What do you know about it? More than nothing. I married a brown girl. You should eat. Eta : 12 hours. Think about what you want, Aileen. 
 
 (door closes) (keys jingling) Hey. I'm sorry. We were there forever. Is everything okay? 19 stitches. Jesus. Good night, guys. Do you need help, hon? No. You okay? I don't know. (sighs) Everything's just so... f*cked up? Complicated. Yeah. Dana's like a surly stranger in my house. I don't even know where she went. How did she go from my adorable, loving baby to that? Were you adorable and loving when you were 16, Jess? You and Brody having it out. And now he's gone, I have no idea where. Chris is still aces. (chuckles softly) I just want things to be simple again. Hey. I miss you. Chris  (in distance): Mom? Coming, sweetie. Chris wants you. I heard. Thanks for watching him, and thanks for fixing the door. No problem. Does it hurt? Yeah. How about... you? Yeah. I think we all need to give peace a chance around here. You know what would help with that? If you stayed away from us. There's no place for my dad when you're here, Mike. (quiet jazz music playing) Hungry? Thirsty. Me, too. We're not doing that. No. No. (clears throat) Sorry. (laughs) No, I am, I am. Jesus. I feel like a terrified teenager. I know, I know. Well, sh1t, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna ask. Will you go to the prom with me? Do I get a corsage? Wrist or pin-on? Actually, I'll take a nosegay. I-I don't even know what that is. It's a kind of bouquet from medieval times. Is that right? Yeah. Pre-shower, pre-soap, they would carry them around to mask the unpleasant smells of the time. To keep their, their "nose gay." I know these things. (both laugh) Are you still thirsty? Not at all. (thunder rumbles) (both panting) Do you want to stop? No, I just want to live here. For a second. (moaning) Issa? Issa? (gasps) Issa, where are you, goddamn it?! Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. (gasping) It's okay, you're with me. Issa, no! You're with me. You're with me. You're with me. What happened? You're safe. You're not there. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. ♪ ♪ (sighs) Where are we? Calliope, Indiana. I grew up here. There were four Jewish families. My dad was the local druggist. The nearest synagogue was three hours away. So we'd come here. You're religious? My parents were. Commerce brought 'em here, even though the community didn't want us. And they gave me strict orders not to assimilate. You can't be on the baseball team. They start the game with a Christian prayer. You can't sing Christmas carols. When the other kids stand to sing, you sit at your desk with your hands folded. Respectful. But silent. Being a dutiful son, I did precisely as they asked. Happily? What do you think? I was a kid. I just wanted to play ball, I wanted to be in the pageant. I'd gladly say their prayers, sing the songs. I just wanted to not be alone. Man, I hated this place. It was the reason I was different..trange..solated. They f*ck you up. Yeah. We got to get going. The agents await. I don't know what happened to you, Aileen. I don't know how you went from one more angry teenage girl to joining the f*cking jihadists. And if your issues are truly geopolitical-- Then I can't help you. I think you wound up here because you fell in love with a boy. And he's gone now. Oh, that's a heartbreaker. I want to get you through this as best I can. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. So, I know I have oatmeal-- Maybe frozen O.J., but no Yorkshire Gold out here in the sticks, sorry. Brody : What? Ugh-- Knowing my dad, we're probably looking at Folgers. And I'm not kidding. How do you know the tea I drink? I don't know. You probably had it at Langley. I'm gonna go get some wood. I'll be right back. So what's the trouble at home? Nothing much. Just the love of my life walking out my door. For good? I hope not. 'Cause I can't imagine being that lost. What happened to his body? Raqim? It's probably in an Ohio morgue. He'd want a Muslim burial. Well, if no one claims him, he'll be buried in a potter's field. (phone ringing) Estes. David, it's me. We have a deal with Aileen. She talked? We need someone up on the roof of that house under the flight path now. What did she tell you? She doesn't have the full story. They were just told to buy the house, go about their business till a visitor arrived. Which he did on Monday. She get a name? No. But he was American. She's sitting with a sketch artist right now. Guy didn't say a word, went right to the roof. He spent over an hour up there. Doing what? That's what we got to figure out. All right, we'll get Galvez up on the roof right away. Hi. I didn't drink tea at Langley. What? Yorkshire Gold. That wasn't just a lucky guess. Well, why does that matter? Were you watching me? I don't know what you mean. I mean did you spy on me? You are a spy, right? Brody... That's why we ran into each other at the support group, isn't it? Why you slipped me your number in case I ever need to ask anything? No, you're wrong, Brody... Don't f*cking lie to me, Carrie! It was my job. It is my job. Oh, so you're still spying. I'm working. I'm always working. On what suspicion? Tell me, goddamn it! sh1t. You looking for this? Abu Nazir's bomb maker told me an American prisoner of war had been turned. And he was coming home, to carry out an attack. And you believed this? He told me minutes before he was executed. So? So he was my prisoner. I interrogated him for months. He was cooperating at the end. There was no reason for him to lie. You think I'm that P.O.W.? There's no one else it could be. You're telling me the f*cking CIA thinks I'm working for al-Qaeda? I think you're working of al-Qaeda. (scoffs) (exhales sharply) What about the gun, Carrie? Bears? Intruders? We just keep it in the cabin. Mm. Plus, you never know when a terrorist might darken your door. I never said terrorist-- I said turned. If that were true, if any of this were true, wouldn't I just kill you right now? Not if you're playing the long game. (clearing throat) Ask me anything. What? There's the gun. Hold it to my f*cking head and ask me anything you want to know. I'll show you how wrong you are. Afzal Hamid. What about him? Did you slip him a razor blade at the safe house? How could I do that? Answer the question. No. But I wish I had. And I hope he bled slowly, and died in a lot of pain. Who's Issa? Where did you hear that name? Who is he? He was my guard. He was nice to me. What goes on in your garage? My garage? You said ask anything. I take the trash bins in and out. Fix a bicycle sometimes. Why do you go there so late at night, so early in the morning? To pray. What is that? What? Nothing. No, it's not nothing. It's a habit. When I don't have my prayer beads. You're a Muslim? Yeah. You live in despair for eight years, you might turn to religion, too. And the King James Bible was not available. Why did they kill Walker and not you? You asked me that in the debrief. Yeah, and you were evasive. It doesn't matter. I'll decide that. You don't need to know. I need to know everything. I killed him. Okay? I  killed him. They told me to beat him to death or be killed myself. (sighs) And so I did it. And I vowed to never tell another living soul. Who told you to kill him? Abu Nazir. So you did meet him. Yes. You lied to us about meeting one of the leaders of al-Qaeda? That's right. You want to explain that? I was embarrassed. Ashamed. Why? Because he offered me comfort, and I took it. And became his follower? A soldier in his jihad? No. No. Jesus, don't you understand anything I'm telling you? I'm not made of that stuff. I'm no hero. I had nothing to give. I was broken, living in the dark, for years, and a man walked in..nd he was kind to me. (breathing tightly) And I loved him. (cell phone ringing) Galvez : Hello? Saul  (on phone): Galvez, you up there? Affirmative. I've searched every square inch. No weapons, no tools, nothing. Okay, so what's this guy doing up there for an hour? Galvez : Well, it's pristine, I'll tell you that. Would have expected some bird sh1t and whatnot. Saul : He cleaned his workspace. Galvez : I guess. Okay. Face the airport, Galvez. We're looking for direct line of sight targets. Now, what do you see? Galvez : There's a bunch of airport hotels. Uh... a control tower maybe half a mile out. And how about further? You got binoculars? Yeah. Okay, Terminal B is about a mile away. Air France, hanger 30. And what is that? It's small. Has a helipad out front. Any signage? Uh... "Reserve M-1." Marine One. That's a landing pad for Marine One. Oh, sh1t. A mile is well within a sniper's range. An expert sniper. Saul : An American military sniper. David. Send me Sergeant Brody's picture. Brody? Why? So Aileen can look at it. So we done here? Well, you have an answer for everything. But you still don't believe me. I know an American P.O.W. was turned. It has to be you. (sighs) (phone vibrating) I'm leaving. No. We're not finished. Yeah, we're finished. If you want to arrest me, you can come to my house. No! Brody! Or maybe you want to shoot me, now. (vibrating) Brody! Saul... We were wrong about Brody. What... what do you mean? Saul :  A P.O.W. was turned. But it wasn't him. I, I... I don't understand. Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker. The other soldier captured with Brody. Tom Walker died. No. He's alive. He's the terrorist. sh1t. Brody! Wait! I, I was wrong. I made a terrible mistake. Don't you think I don't already know that? I'm sorry. I am so sorry. This weekend, this time that we spent together, it was real. The parts that..hat we both... The important parts. Hey, Carrie. f*ck you. (stifled sobbing) ♪ ♪
