 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan : This relentless pursuit of terror. President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. This was an act of terrorism. It was a despicable and cowardly act. The next samba we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. ...until something stops him. Carrie :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? f*ck! Carrie :  I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Saul :  Previously on  Homeland... Fatima, tell me what you know about Abu Nazir. He's meeting my husband tomorrow. Here in Beirut. You can kill them both. Saul : I didn't want her here in the first place. She's not well. I don't know if this woman's for real or if Carrie wants her to be for real. The way I am now, I wouldn't trust me either. But the Carrie who recruited her, that one I believe. (speaking Arabic) Brody : Hi, Roya. Congressman Brody. I'm a friend of Nazir's. I will not help you in the killing of innocent civilians. I met a young man yesterday. Lost both his arms in Iraq. They have a fund-raiser coming up, and I thought that we could host it together. Red Team Two, fire discipline is two shots each. Targets are two in robes. Estes :  Holy sh1t, it's him. Fire. Somebody warned him. Brody :  I'm a congressman. I cannot be texting secret messages while I am surrounded by the f*cking Joint Chiefs. Is anyone in the apartment? No. Give me your keys. Saul : Carrie. We just missed Abu Nazir. Get in the car. Back in the car! We can't leave here without getting what's in there. (gunshot) Carrie. (Carrie screams) I got you. My name is Nicholas Brody. By the time you watch this, you'll have read a lot of things about me. (speaking Arabic) This way. Now. (speaking Arabic) That briefcase is clearly marked as a diplomatic bag. Do not open it. Key please. Saul Berenson. Jewish, yes? American. A Lebanese security official must know better than to do that unless he's actually working for someone else. Like, say, Hezbollah. If you don't put that back and allow me to continue to my flight, you'll be the cause of a serious diplomatic incident with the United States. So, please, take a moment. Think carefully. (locks briefcase) Never come back to Lebanon. Woman : Sir, I need you to put the briefcase in the overhead bin for takeoff, please. I'll do it. Just give me a second. (crickets chirping) (jazz music playing) (snaps fingers) Jesus, Dad, what? What the hell are you doing? Do you even know what time it is? I'm writing a report. At 3:20 a.m.? What? Have you been up all night doing this? You need to put this away, and go to sleep. I can't. Not yet. I have to get this done, - and it has to be done right. For crying out loud. Carrie, you have a disease. Dad, please, not now. And in case you've forgotten what I know, your doctor has told you a million times... sleep is one of the most, if not the most important... I know. I know. I'm nearly finished. I promise. How much longer? (sighs) Two hours, max. One. One more hour. Fine. You can't do this to yourself anymore, sweetheart. You just can't. I'm okay. In fact, I feel pretty great. Wired is what you are. There's a difference. Point taken. One more hour. One more. Sorry. It was just, it was here on the table and, uh... And just jumped out at you? Well, I know how much you hate talking about this stuff in public. Um, I was just curious what you were planning to say tonight. What do you think? "By my third year in captivity, I knew that this was where I was gonna die, that I had to accept that, make peace with it, so that's what I did. I prepared to die." "But I didn't die. Somehow I got to come home to a wife and two kids I'd talked myself into believing would be just fine, no, better off, without me. I mean how could they really know me anymore?" Too much? Well, it's just..t's the first time I've ever heard it. I, um... I never knew this is how you felt. Yeah. You're right. I don't really like talking about it. Brody. What? Look... I didn't mean... It's okay, Jess. It's all right. No, no, no, it's not. Hey... I know you're doing this event for me. I want you to know I appreciate it. Thank you. Hey, Jess, wait, wait. Wait. Seriously? You want me to stop? No. Follow me. Hey. Brody... Slow down, slow down. Look at me. Go slow. Yeah. Like that. Yeah. (door opens) Hey, aren't you home early today? Teacher's conference day. What's your excuse? Hey. Jessica : Xander. Day off at your school, too? Coincidence, huh? Or maybe not. I already graduated last year. It's all good. Dana : So, uh..low day in Congress, Dad? Or... Don't you have homework to do? I already did it. (phone buzzes) (clears throat) It's work trying to get a hold of me. Dana : Is that the cup that Chris made for Dad? sh1t. I got your text. We have a problem and no time, so please just listen. The CIA are in the middle of processing intelligence from their operation in Beirut. They're very close to finding out about our friend in Gettysburg. The Tailor? You need to go there now and move him to a safe house, 60 miles further west. Well, why don't you just call him and tell him to move? Because I might unnerve him unnecessarily. He needs to be looked in the eye and reassured that he's in safe hands. Why me? Why not you? Because he doesn't know me. He knows you. You're the only one he knows. How can you be sure the CIA hasn't already sent somebody out there? Because I'm sure. They found an e-mail that mentions a contact in Gettysburg. They're only just now putting together a list of suspects in the area. Is there a problem, Nicholas? Yeah, I'd say there's a f*cking problem. I am giving a speech at a dinner for wounded veterans tonight, in D.C. which the vice president is attending. If you go there now, you'll make it back easily. You move him as fast as possible. I don't believe this. Must I remind you, he's the one man who knows the truth about you? (sighs) Take the Tailor to 124 Mount Chapel Road, Somerset. The key's in the bird feeder on the tree to the right of the garage, around back. Repeat the address back to me. 124 Mount Chapel Road, Somerset. (doorbell rings) Can I help you? Hello, Mr. Mathison. Is Carrie here? Carrie : Oh, I got it. Hey, Danny. Frank : CIA never heard of e-mail? Uh, you making eggs, Dad? It's lunchtime. A sandwich then. Sure. Carrie : Hey, Danny. Sorry about that. Danny : How you doing, Carrie? I'm good. Is that it? Yep. All 18 pages. I'll get this to everybody right away. What time is the debrief with the group? Uh, scheduled for 6:00. So late? Estes is at an emergency threat level briefing all day. What's going on? Um, nothing specific. Yet. But the top brass huddle every single day now. Hey, can I say..hat you just did in the field-- was pretty damn impressive. Thanks, Danny. I appreciate that. I'll text you later to confirm the 6:00 p.m. debrief. - Thanks. I look forward to it. Pickle on your sandwich? (birds chirping) (cash register chatters) (door bell jingles) Assalamo Allaikum. Wa 'alaikum-as-salam. You. I need you to pack a bag. Fast. Bag? What for? The CIA know about you. I gotta get you out of here. How do you know this? I'll explain in the car. Hurry. No, tell me now. The CIA had an operation in Beirut to kill Abu Nazir. He escaped, but they found intelligence that may lead to you. Where are you taking me? To a safe house. How do you know it's safe? Hey, all I know is you're not safe here anymore. Who sent you? Look, I'm here to help you. Get a bag, let's go. f*ck. Forget the bag. Go. Go! Okay, walk. Get in the car. Don't make me say it twice. (tires screech) Carrie : Bob kisses his wife and children good-bye. Esl Students : Bob kisses his wife and children good-bye. Uh, Bob drives to work in a red car. Students : Bob drives to work in a red car. Are you okay, Miss Carrie? I'm s... What, Lulu? What's wrong? No text from boyfriend, eh? (students laugh) Galvez  (on phone): Hi, this is Danny Galvez. Please leave a message. (beep) Danny, it's Carrie. Uh, it's nearly 5:00, and I never heard back about the debrief, so... I'm heading out now. Uh... call if anything's changed. Thanks. What happens when we get there? I drop you off. You wait. They said that? I'm guessing. So you don't know? It's an educated guess. I wait for what? Well, I imagine they want to get you out of the country as fast as possible. You imagine. You guess. Take a breath. If it wasn't for me, you'd probably be on your way to Guantanamo by now. You think if they caught me that I would talk? They're not gonna catch you now. You know what else they didn't tell me? Your name. Suit yourself. We'll be there in 30 or 40 minutes, and you'll be somebody else's problem. Bassel. My name is Bassel. (wheel rattling, tires screeching) (cursing in Arabic) f*ck. Oh, you gotta be sh1tting me. There's no f*cking jack. Cynthia : So once the table staff's done, we can do a final light and sound check, and did you bring Nick's speech, for the teleprompter team? Oh, I didn't even think of that. Um, he has it with him. Oh... well, where is he? Can we send someone to get it? Yeah, I'll call him. Uh, he's at his office. Jessica..ou look so nervous. Relax. Listen to me. You're a beautiful woman, Nick is so charismatic. You're a great American story that's just beginning. Did you loosen the wheel? This one won't move. Here, give me that thing. (grunts) All right. All right. I need you to get in the car. Start driving it forward-- real slow, okay?-- until the wood straightens, and it takes the weight of the car, like a jack. Okay? Go. It only needs a little gas. Just ease the car forward. I'll tell you when to stop. (engine starting) All right. (revs engine) No! Whoa! Take it easy! Easy! Okay, that's good. (cell phone rings) Hey. Jessica : Where are you? I called your office. They said you never went there. Right, right. I, uh... I was on my way out to the office, I got a call from the Whip's office... (Brody continues indistinctly) Your district? To do what? Oh, to, uh, to reassure some union folk we haven't forgotten about them. (continues indistinctly) Jess, I said I'll be back on time, and I will. Okay? You've got to see this room, Brody. It's amazing. They've done such a beautiful job... Right. That's great. I can't wait. ...just get back to this meeting now. Oh, I almost forgot. The teleprompter guy needs a copy of your speech. I don't need a teleprompter. I got it all in my head. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure. Trust me. It's not as though I haven't done anything like this before. Well, drive safe. Um, I will see you in an hour and a half. Copy that. I was coming to get that. To finish changing the wheel. It's okay, I'll get the wheel. You get the spare. (jazz music plays on radio) Hi, Lorraine. Hello, Carrie. You are early. We weren't expecting you until 6:00. Thank, Carl. Where's David? In a meeting. He'll be back soon. (sighs) I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back. 
 
 Estes : ...and Abu Nazir's network, which indicates that right now, Iran has mustered all hands on deck to strike us on our own.... Carrie : I'm sorry. Am I late? I was told 6:00 p.m. Which would, in fact, mean I'm 15 minutes early. Carrie, you can't be in here. What's going on, David? You're doing the debrief without me? Please. Always debrief with the person who was in the field, David. It's in the goddamn manual. In this case, because it's you, I decided to go ahead with the debrief using just the report. Because it's me? Meaning what, exactly? Meaning the detail of your report. As usual, quite frankly, it's, uh, it's excellent. What...? Why didn't anyone call me? I told Danny to hold off on that, because I wanted to see you anyway. Here I am. Privately. To tell you what an amazing job you did for us in Beirut. You mean like a.. pat on the back? Thanks to you, we got this close to Abu Nazir, and took out two of his top lieutenants in the process. He's still out there, David. We let him get away. We need to be doing everything possible... That's not..our concern anymore. Well..hat about all that stuff I pulled out of the Beirut apartment? Can you at least tell me if there was any actionable intelligence in that? Between you and me? Yes, there was. That's it? Carrie, you didn't come here today expecting to get reinstated, right? What? No. No, of course not. I don't know what to tell you... You don't have to say anything, David. Come on, let me walk you... No, you have work to do. I'll see myself out. (elevator bell dings) No. You stay in the car, out of sight. I need to go to the bathroom. We're five minutes from the safe house. Put a knot in it. I need more tobacco. (rock music playing) Hey. Can I get a, uh, pack of that tobacco, some papers, and the rest on gas, please. m*therf*cker. Bassel! Bassel! What did those assholes do to you now? I don't want to talk about it, Dad. Not tonight. Please? Where are you going? I'll be back for the rest tomorrow. Um... I'm going home, Dad. All I know is I need to figure out what to do with the rest of my life now, and I can't do that here with you all just hovering over me. A good night's sleep is what you need. In my own bed. Bassel! There's nothing to be afraid of. (rustling) Come on, buddy, there's nothing to be afraid of. Come out. Bassel? (phone ringing) (grunts) Ah! God! God! (ringing continues) (ringing continues) (Bassel groans) What are you doing?! I'm trying to f*cking help you! (Bassel groaning) sh1t! (Brody grunts) (squishing sound, Bassel groans) (Bassel groans) (Brody grunts) (Brody panting) All right, got to stop the bleeding. You got a handkerchief? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You got a handkerchief? Hold it there. Hold on. All right, all right. Please..ake me to hospital. No, I take you to the hospital, I might as well just hand you over to the CIA. I don't want to die. You're not gonna die, so kill that thought right f*cking now! I have a family... Syria. Wife... daughter. That's good. That's good, that's good. Keep thinking about your daughter. She'll give you the strength you need. Please... hospital. (grunts) I'm taking you to a safe house, and we're gonna call for help from there. (panting) You can leave me outside the hospital. I won't say anything to anyone. No. You know I can't do that. (phone ringing) (continues panting) (groans, pants) (phone continues ringing) (panting) (ringing continues) (stops panting) Hey, Jess. Where are you? I've been trying to call you. You're late. Jessica : The vice president is due to arrive any second now. (panting): I had a flat, Jess. A flat?! Where? Middle of nowhere. I don't know, miles from anywhere. I don't know. What?! (Bassel groans) Christ, Brody! Hey, and guess what? There's no jack in the car. Well, did you call a tow truck? Yeah, I called a tow truck. Where'd you tell 'em to go if you don't know where you are? What? Oh, I'm near... I'm near, uh, Culpepper. Route 29. That's miles away. You're never gonna make it back in time. What about your speech? (inhales sharply) I don't know. This isn't happening. It can't be. Bassel  (weakly): Help... (Brody gasps) What was that? (grunting) (grunting over phone) Brody? Brody, are you there? Shh! Shh! (muffled grunting) Yeah, I'm here, I'm here. What was that? What was what? You sound like you're out of breath. I know. (both grunting) Brody? You're breaking up. (muffled grunting) (neck snaps) Brody? Brody? Brody, are you there? You know, I-I think I should try the tow truck again. You promised you would be here. I know. I'll see you later. (panting) (Brody panting) ♪ ♪ (drops keys on table) (sighs) ♪ ♪

Who am I supposed to go up there and introduce now? Don't worry, sir. This is my mess. (clears throat) Hello. Um, my name is Jessica Brody. My husband, Nick Brody, who, most of you know, was rescued and returned to us after eight years as a prisoner of the terrorists, had prepared a speech about the challenges of coming home, but I'm afraid he's had car trouble and isn't going to make it here tonight. f*cking Brody. Jessica : Um, so I'm afraid this means you're stuck with me. Car trouble. Pretty sure, when he was a prisoner in Iraq, he never thought he'd have to deal with something so humdrum as a flat tire again. (light laughter) You know, fund-raisers and political speeches are great and everything, but I can't help thinking one of the best ways to help our wounded warriors starts with the family. Because one thing I do know-- I'd have been able to support my husband better if I'd been more ready. After eight years of loneliness... ...eight years of not seeing each other... ...if someone had warned me how he'd look at me... ...as if he didn't know me anymore... ...how violent his nightmares would be that he would attack me in his sleep, um, how he didn't know what to say to the kids those first few weeks, how hard intimacy of any kind would be for him... If someone had actually warned me in plain English how hard coming home would be for him, that I'd need to adjust my expectations... What I'm saying is, what if, with some of this money, we could set up a place where families could get ready for their veterans coming home? An actual place where they can learn from other families who have been through..ho are still going through it. Because, in the end, we're all fighting this war together. Thank you. Thank you very much. (grunting) You hardly said a word the whole way. Want to talk about it? You coming in for a nightcap? Better not. It's late. I got an early start tomorrow. You've always been there for me, Mike. You were amazing tonight. Good night. Hey. Maybe it was just car trouble. Maybe. I'm just saying, you might want to cut him some slack. Cut him some slack? Hey, innocent until proven guilty, Jess. Are you aware that there was a weekend not long ago-- a whole weekend-- where Brody just didn't come home at all? You want to know why? He was with that CIA woman. The crazy one. You know, let me be crystal clear. He was f*cking the bitch for a whole weekend. And you want to know why I'm having a problem believing this whole car trouble story? Wait, back it up. He f*cked who? I don't remember her name-- Carrie something. I don't know anymore. I thought you weren't coming in. Maybe just for one drink. (clears throat) (car door opens and closes) She kicked ass tonight, Brody. I mean, she was f*cking awesome. I don't doubt it. She's quite the hostess. No. I mean she got up there and she gave a speech of her own. You did? I'll say good night, then. (car door opens and closes) (engine starts) Jesus. Where the hell have you been? You're soaking wet. It was raining. And there was no jack in the car. Have you ever tried to change a tire without a jack? Was there really a union meeting in your district today? Yes. Where? What town? Don't answer that. I don't want to hear another lie. I'm not lying. Oh, they just roll off your tongue, don't they? One after the other. I really thought we turned a corner this morning. You're hiding something. I can see it in your eyes. Now, either you tell me what is going on... There's nothing going... ...or I suggest you start looking for a hotel room. And while you're at it, you give this marriage some serious thought, because I don't think I can do this anymore. (door closes) (door closes) (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings twice) (knocking on door) (knocking) (knocking) (doorbell rings) (knocking) (doorbell rings) Finally. You're not in Beirut? Came straight here from the airport. I hear you were turned away from the debrief at Langley today. I was the one who recovered that intel. He wouldn't even let me present it. Oh, I can only imagine how shitty that must have felt. Still feels. (sighs) Before the Beirut trip, I really thought I'd finally found a way to cope with being out of The Company. Before you dig that hole any deeper, I have to show you something. This your computer? Yeah. Here. You put it in. I'll only f*ck it up. (laughing) This is the one piece of intel you recovered in Beirut that Estes and his mob haven't seen yet. I came straight from the airport because I think you deserve to see it first. My name is Nicholas Brody, and I'm a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps. People will say I was broken, I was brainwashed. People will say that I was turned into a terrorist. Oh, my God. Taught to hate my country. My action this day is against such domestic enemies. The vice president and members of his national security team, who I know to be liars and war criminals. I was right. Responsible for atrocities they were never held accountable for. You were right. This is about justice for 82 children whose deaths were never acknowledged and whose murder is a stain on the soul of this nation. And I want to tell you about one of these children. I was right.
