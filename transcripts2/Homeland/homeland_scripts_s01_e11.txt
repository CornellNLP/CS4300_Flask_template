 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe, the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan : This relentless pursuit of terror. President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. This was an act of terrorism. It was a despicable and cowardly act. The next number we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. ...until something stops him. Woman :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? God! Carrie :  f*ck! I missed something once before. I won't...  can't  Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Previously on  Homeland:  At 4:42 p.m. a drone missile hit and destroyed part of a compound in the mountains of northern Iraq. The images being broadcast of the bodies of 83 dead children allegedly killed in the strike And they call us terrorists. The Vice President, the man most instrumental in the drone attack,  is going to want to use you. Get as close to him as you possibly can. Representative Richard Johnson mean anything to you? I watch the news. I'm interested. A political office? What are you talking about? I don't want to do it if there's even a chance the media would find out about us. Saul :  Al Zahrani's running a terrorist cell out of the Saudi embassy. He and Tom Walker are planning an attack on the United States. Who are you? You're CIA? What's the tradecraft for setting a meeting with Walker? I put my child's drawing of a red heart  in the window of my living room. Saul :  I'd like you to go back to your house now, put that drawing in your window tonight. So, I'm bait? It could be Walker. It's hard to tell. I can't see his face. I need visual confirmation. Saul : He's approaching Al Zahrani. Saul, what's in the f*cking briefcase?! Everyone, get out of here! Carrie? ♪ ♪ (ball bearings rattling) ♪ ♪ The President's a busy man, David. He wants his helicopter ungrounded. Not when we're seeing increased chatter with references to Marine One. He's been briefed, it doesn't faze him. Well, tell him it should. I did. So? So he's the leader of the free world, David. He doesn't enjoy looking like some impotent asshole, which is how this guy Walker's making us all look. He'll look even worse if his helicopter gets blown out of the sky. Tell him that. What have we got? 16 agencies. You are kidding me. Nope. 16 agencies had some awareness of our operation to get Walker. And that's just on the intelligence side. So how do I find the leak? You can start by looking around you. Goddamn it. Sir. Yeah? The Vice President wants to see you. He's here? No, sir. Succession protocol requires him to be on lockdown as long as the threat to the President remains red. He's in his bunker. Where's Carrie? Still in the hospital. She's supposed to be released in a few hours. Good. Tell her we need her here. Yes, sir. Carrie : Green. No, green. I was specific about that, and I don't see what the problem is. (panting): A green pen is what I want. And blue is what is available. Okay, green is important. Green is necessary. It doesn't make sense if it isn't green, and it's really not an unreasonable request. Carrie? Saul, thank God! My green pen is dry. I asked four, five, six times for a new one, but there's no understanding. They offered me blue, they offered me black. I mean, is green so hard? Is green elusive? I mean, my kingdom for a f*cking green pen! She's yours? Yes. She should go to her room. The doctor will be in. Okay, I am laser-focused on the green, but there's more. There's many, many, many, many more. The thing is, Saul, that Abu Nazir has methods and patterns and priorities. A single sniper? No, no. Abu Nazir doesn't do that. He never has, he never will. He goes big! He explodes! He maims en masse, we know that. Slow down, slow down. Facts... facts are facts, and we have about a week, maybe less, to figure out the real target, not this single shot to the president, spy-novel-101 bullshit. Well, actually, that's the working theory. Well, it's wrong. It's, it's incomplete. Walker's not even critical! He's just a part, a piece, a pixel. A pawn of no importance. There is a bigger, pernicious Abu Nazir-worthy plot out there, and we have little time. We have to code it, collide it, collapse it, contain it. Lie down, Carrie. The doctor's coming. Okay, the important thing now is the green pen. (breathing heavily) (gasps) Thank you. Why Gettysburg? You heard why. He wants to spend time with his family. Yeah, but it has to be in Pennsylvania? I mean, it can't be here? Can you just help, please? Mom, I have plans tonight with Xander. He already bought tickets. (knocking) (doorbell rings) Actually, that's probably him. He said he might come over. Dad, I got it. It's okay. Hey, Sergeant B! Hello. Is it true you're running for Congress? Yeah. Are you? You 18? No felonies? No, none yet. All right. How are you? Good. Hey, Mrs. B! Well, you obviously didn't tell Xander we're leaving for a couple days. It's a whole couple of days now? Jessica : It's just overnight. Xander, uh, why don't you tell them about those tickets that you already bought? What-what tickets? Dana, you're going. You know, I could stay here by myself. No, you can't. You know, I could stay with her. You're kidding, right? Dana, we've already discussed this. Come Monday, the campaign's gonna take over, you're not gonna see your father for days at a time. He just wants to spend one last weekend with the four of us. I don't think it's too much to ask. Okay, I give up. I'll go. Mmm! Yeah, I'll go. Hi. Dr. Jeremy. Where's Dr. Steiner? Not here today. You're the doctor? (sighs) I've been waiting a half an hour. I'm sorry. I mean, I got a real situation here. I'm aware. I spoke with Carrie earlier. Well, then you can explain to me what's going on. As far as her injuries go, Carrie is fine. I already heard that. I-I-I mean, um..ow she's acting. I'm sorry. I have to speak with Carrie privately. I'd like to come. She'll allow it. Saul, there you are. Hey, how you feeling, Carrie? Is it time yet? Are we going? Going? To work. We gotta hop-to. We gotta haul ass to Langley. They have to understand, Saul. Nazir's movements in green after a fallow yellow always creeping towards purple are methodical, meaningful momentous and monstrous. Okay, I'm gonna get you a bit more Ativan to settle you down. I don't need to settle down! Tell him! Saul, tell him. Carrie..ou're not yourself. Of course I am! No. I can't follow you. You're talking very fast. Your thoughts are running together. All these ideas... I-I... I can't understand. Is there a doctor we should call? My sister. Honey, is this really necessary? Complain to Ma, she's the one that got it for me. Really? Careful, careful! I'm driving. Jack me to Gettysburg, and this is what you get. Okay, here it is. "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on "this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." What's four score? Four times 20. Lincoln means "87 years ago." He's talking about the American Revolution of 1776. Why didn't he just say that? You'll see when we get there. How far are we now? Three score miles. (all chuckle) Hey, come on. Holy sh1t! Dana! Really? I'm sorry. I just hadn't realized Dad's scars were so faded. I mean, you can barely see 'em now. She'll be here, right? I mean, she said she was on her way? Maggie will come. Maggie's reliable. You can count on Maggie every time. (chuckles) Is she an especially slow driver? Okay... Huh? This is red  and  blue, it's not red  or  blue. Okay. Maybe she got pulled over. (mutters): sh1t... Sleeping dogs here, sleeping dogs there. This whole box is dogs, really. She can fix this, right? She said she was bringing medication. The question is what wakes them? Is it a whisper, a crash, a deep internal pain? How about a glass of water? (doorbell rings) Hi. Hi. She's manic? I don't know, you tell me. Hi, Carrie. Hi, Maggie. You look so professional. So this isn't new? No. She's bi-polar. She's stable on her meds. The explosion must have sent her into a flight. Why didn't she ever tell me? She said no one at work could know. Right. So what do we do? We'll up her Lithium. We're giving her Clonazepam to start leveling her out. Carrie? Is it essential, entirely? Yeah, it is. Here you go. So that's it? She'll be fine by what, morning? No. It takes time. Days. Maybe a week. Oh, that long? And someone needs to watch her while she's evening out. Full-time? Or we put her in the psych ward. Well, that would kill her security clearance forever. That's why I treat her. Well... I got to get back to work. I can stay till 7:00. Can you take the night shift? Well, what do I have to do? Just be with her. Keep her out of trouble. Okay. 7:00. (elevator bell dings) (door buzzes) Welcome to my goddamn humble abode. Want to tell me where we stand? We've been coordinating security with your secret service detail. Well, I've been in here for eight hours. At present, the threat... The threat is one f*cking guy. Marine sniper, sir, highly trained. Do you see where I am? Do you? I'm underground cowering out of sight, at a time when I need to be highly visible. I'm announcing my candidacy next week for President of the United States. You may need to push that back, sir. I'm not going to push that back... Sorry... I am not going to push that back. That date is set. And I'm not going to do it from here. Vote for the f*cking cave dweller just because you can't locate Tom Walker. Yes, sir. So fix it. Sir, there's something you should know. What's that? The C-4 used in the explosion-- we sourced it to a Saudi shipment. Oh... It was delivered last year to Prince Sultan Air Base. Part of a large arms deal that came in... Why do you do this? What's that, sir? Tell me things I don't want to hear. We've got two Muslims dead in a mosque, an explosion in the streets of D.Cnd Walker who the f*ck knows where? You want your portrait up on the walls at Langley someday? Focus on that. Find Walker. Yes, sir. And fire someone. I don't care who. Chris : That's it? Brody : Yep. That's it. Chris : Can we go now? Only if you can tell me what happened here. Battle of Gettysburg. Can you be more specific? Four score and... I didn't know I'd be tested. Okay, we're in Pennsylvania, right? Was that the South or the North? God. North. That's right. General Lee had brought the war to the North. The South was winning. The Northern forces were outnumbered, and they were on the run. Then they dug in there. All along that ridge. General Meade, the Northern general, he drew a line out there and he gave instructions to his troops to defend it at all costs. And that means with your life. What happened? They prayed. Both sides did. These were extremely religious people. I meant what happened with the fighting? Well, imagine... You're bone tired, you're cut off from water. The most crucial part of the line that must be held it's right up there. You see up there, that little hill? It's Little Round Top. There are just 300 of you. You're commanded by a school teacher from Maine. When suddenly, 2,000 enemy soldiers come charging out of those trees, screaming at the top of their lungs, determined to cut you down. Did they? They charged twice. And then a third time. And that's when this teacher from Maine-- Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain was his name... ...asked his men to do a very strange thing. What? He told them to stop shooting. No guns, just bayonets. And instead of shooting they charged down the side of that hill toward the enemy. And it was so unexpected, it was so crazy, that the line was held that day. All because of a school teacher from Maine, who was willing to do what was necessary for a cause that he believed in. Saul. Where've you been? You told me to get Carrie, remember? Where is she? Keeping her another day. Perfect. Hey, David. She said something interesting. Of course she did. Sniper attack-- that doesn't make sense for Abu Nazir. It's not his methodology. Well, maybe it is when he has a military sniper working for him. She thinks something bigger. Marine One all over the wire. New references to Marine Two. The two leaders of the free world aren't fancy enough targets for you? She says it's a sideshow. If she wants to get her ass in to work I'll be happy to bat that around with her. Right. And it better be soon, because the Vice President's about to fire us all. She just got blown up, David. Might not be tomorrow. Why, what's the problem? Doctor's orders. Dad. Yeah? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I was just thinking. Where'd your mom go? Gift shop with Chris. I had no idea that you knew so much. About Gettysburg? About anything. (chuckles) I mean, I know you're a Marine and all, and I shouldn't be surprised. Anyway, I get why you wanted to come here. Can you promise me something? Yeah. What? I have this feeling that things are going to get pretty wild soon. Geez, Dad, it's just a campaign. Your mom's going to need you. When I'm not around. Promise me you'll watch out for her. Promise me. Chris : Hey, look what we got. Yeah, I promise. You want one? Oh, that's fantastic. One for you. That's great. I don't get a general's hat? I'm the boss around here, that's why. You are. Let's see you salute. Hi-oh. Corporal First Class. How do you have no food in your house? I eat out. You eat Chinese take-out and yogurt. You ever hear of the four food groups? Yes. But I won't recite them because I'm resting my mind. I know you hate this. I have a lot of work to do. You always say that. No, no, something big is happening. Something dangerous. There's no time for rest. I know you feel that. But you'll need to trust my judgment now. You need rest, healthy meals, patience. Carrie! Carrie, what are you doing? Carrie! (horn honking) (tires squealing) Carrie! (car door opening and closing) What are you doing? What the hell are you doing?! Look at this. You have to stay with me. Isn't this amazing? We're going home. Somewhere down there, there's a sliver of green just-just taking its time. This is-- this is how everything works. Carrie... You wait, you lay low, and then... Then you come to life. Come on. Come on. (panting) 
 
 So what do you want to eat, guys? I don't know. What do we got? Should we try this place? Oh, babe, you know what? I forgot my toothbrush. I'm going to go pick one up. Okay. All right? Will you get me something to eat? Will you get me a burger? Chocolate shake? Okay. As-salaamu alaykum. Wa alaykum assalaam wa ramat allahi wa barakatuhu. I don't have much time. (clears throat) Put your arm through here. The explosive? Not armed yet. Listen now. These must be tight. Or the vest will show. The switch is here. Under this cover. Wait until the last second before you open it. Some people get nervous. You don't want your hand on the switch until the end. I read that part of the blast goes upward. Toward here. Point of weakness. So that the head is cleanly severed, and normally found intact. Everything else... ...isn't. (speaking Arabic) La ilaha illa Allah. (train whistle blows) Dana : Where were you? Huh? What was that? That package? Oh, that was just something for Mom. What? That was a present. You get me something to eat? Yeah. It's getting cold. Okay. Is something wrong? No. Why? You just sound weird. Come on. What'd you get, a burger? Yeah. Sweet potato fries. I already put ketchup on it. I can't put it in the milkshake now. Get another one. Chris... Chris : Eat it. You eat it. I already, I... Try it. Hey, Dad, isn't this where we were? Chris, did you steal all my fries? Sorry. We were hungry. Yeah. Totally okay. In there, up here. That's us there, Little Round Top. Man : Excuse me? You're that soldier back from Iraq. One of them. You're the hero. Running for office. I'm no hero, sir. Well, whatever you call it, you're one tough m*therf*cker. Man, what you went through-- kind of puts things in perspective. I'd vote for you. Thank you, sir. Pleased to meet you. I'm waiting to hear what you have to say. I'm sure it's going to be good. Hey, this is my son Jimmy. Hey, Jimmy. We run a construction business locally. To be honest... Hi. Hi. She's upstairs. Took her meds already. Good. She was working. There was an incident today. What happened? She almost got hit by a car. She's okay. She's fine. But I had to give her another sedative. She really needs to rest. Okay. I'll go see her. She's probably asleep already. You don't have to. I want to. I'll see you tomorrow. Saul. Sorry I didn't say good-bye this morning. Did you see the papers? Downstairs-- the work? I did. (sighs) There's so much more to do. I'm just so sleepy. That's okay. Rest. Maggie upped my meds. I shouldn't have let her. They're making me so drowsy. (sighs) Carrie? I'm so sorry. About all this. I feel responsible in a way. 'Cause when you came back from Baghdad, I knew. I saw something had happened. You were damaged. I left it alone. Other times when you were so..ut there, I guess I half knew. Maybe hoping it was something else. Anyway, I should have asked. I should have asked if you were really okay. There's no time, Saul. It's high purple. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ (murmurs) ♪ ♪ I thought I heard you out here. I need more ice. Again? It's free. You glad we came? Yeah. The guy at the diner was funny. Yeah. Did you like Gettysburg? Yeah, it was cool. I wanted you to understand. That the Civil War, all wars, they turn everything upside down. Everything and everyone. I hope that you'll remember Joshua Chamberlain when you get older. And be brave, and daring, and ready to fight for what you believe in. Dad... What? Do you mind if we talk about this some other time? It's kind of melting. Tell your sister to go to bed soon. Okay. Good night. Good night. I told Chris to get to bed. (Chris and Dana arguing) (laughing) I'll give him a direct order next time. What? Why the big smile? Just happy to see you, that's all. Yeah? I really think this trip was a great idea. It's like something's changed. Like we've turned this corner, and everything doesn't have to be so difficult anymore. When I was watching you at dinner with those people, how much they need you. I don't think they were even from our district. (laughing) I know. But I could see it. How you're this promise. That things could be better. I wish that I had never said no to your running for office. 'Cause I see now what a good thing it is. Not just for other people..or us, too. Brody, I'm... What? ...happy. It's like you're finally home. (whispers): The kids are next door. Shh, shh, shh... (giggles) (birds chirping in distance) (chuckles) (chuckles) You understand. It's a timeline. Yes! It's Abu Nazir's activities. Were you up all night? More or less. The fallow yellow. He went quiet for months. No videos, no meetings. But then? He came to life again with purpose. More than ever. But why the hibernation? What happened? Injury? Bad health? Or loss. Tragedy. He was mourning during the yellow. And then green was revenge. It was a plan. And now... the purple. He's ready to see it through. It's here. We have to figure out what happened right here. I'll get the A team on it this morning. Galvez-- he can find anything. That's a good idea. (sighs) What about me? You relax. I did hear you last night. You did? I've had this since college. I wrote a 45-page manifesto declaring I'd reinvented music. (chuckles) The professor I handed it to escorted me to Student Health. Ah. (chuckles) I wasn't even in his class. You didn't do anything, Saul. I just came this way. (knocking) (door opens) Dad wanted to be here. You bet I did. Hey, how's my girl, huh? What is that? It's her work. That's goddamned glorious. It should be in the National Galley. Dad, this is Saul. Hey. Frank Mathison. I hear you look out for her. Happily. Sorry. Gotta run. Oh, well... You'll tell Galvez? And you'll sit tight. So? I slept. Hey. Let's get you a square meal. Yeah, yeah, come on. I'll make you one of my world-famous sandwiches, huh? (chuckling) Morning! Ha! Serves you right. You're supposed to be packing, not unpacking. What is it? I told you, something for Mom. Really? You got her something at the drugstore? Yeah, I did. Really. Jessica : You two ready? Yeah. Shh. Yeah, we're ready! Thanks. All right. You're supposed to help me with this. Why? To exercise your mind. But not tax it. I have to go to work. No way. I'm okay! I may have a major situation that I know how to fix. I know how to stop it. Feels good out there, doesn't it? Like you're the Queen of the world. Yes! Exactly! But you're not, Carrie. Okay, I just have to make a call. To who? There's this guy I know. He's a POW. He knows how to fill in this blank, this-this gap because he was there at that exact time. So tell Saul to call him. No, it-it, it has to be me. He only told me. Your sister said no calls. No, I have to, Dad. Hey, look! You're only one day out. Hey, when I'm there, I'm just like you. You know, lots of gut feelings, things that I have to do. But there's good gut, and then there's bad. Yeah? Well, sometimes I think I need to empty my refrigerator and set it on fire, you know? That's what my gut says. It's bad gut. And if I wait a while, I realize it. No, this is right. This is right, I know it. No, Carrie, come on! Hey, come on! Come on! I got the corners together. You can help me with the sides. Carrie! (door closes) Ah, sh1t! Oh, gee, I wonder who leaked our ETA. Maybe he spent the entire weekend here waiting for me. Ever think about that? It's good to be home. What? Yeah. Yeah, it is. (cell phone rings) Oh, it's already started. Chris, help your mom with the bags. Hello. It's Carrie. I know. (panting): Okay. I'm calling you, not because of me and not because of you. I'm not calling to try to... I-I... I'm just calling about Abu Nazir. What? Let me be more clear. Okay. We have been alerted that something is coming. Something is gonna happen imminently, and it all has to do with a certain period in Abu Nazir's life, the fallow yellow if you want to be precise. I don't understand. Okay, you were with him then. You have insight. You can identify the impetus, the incident, the injury. (sighs) Something happened to him, a tragedy. Carrie, are you okay? You loved him! You told me that you loved him, so you must know. Look, uh, would it help if we met? Yes! Yeah, okay. Good. Are you at Langley? No, no, I'm home. Stay there. Okay. Xander : What's that? It's called Little Round Top. It's this place where this teacher from Maine named Joshua Chamberlain saved the Union. I don't see what's so weird about it. Well, it's not the weird part. Okay, here it is. Now it's just your dad. I know. So what's, what's weird about it? He was just strange all weekend, or at least it seemed like it to me. I mean, he said everything was fine, but look at this. He just... stands there. You're right. That is totally weird. (panting, mutters) Okay. (doorbell rings) Maggie : Who's that? It's a friend. David. Sergeant Brody called me. What? He told me everything. I-I don't know what you mean. I think you do. Come on. Let's go inside. What? Come on. Ma'am, sir. Frank : Excuse me. He admitted to being complicit in some kind of fling with you. But illegal surveillance, Carrie? The continuing harassment? No! That-that is a mischaracterization. Your office at Langley's being cleared as we speak. These gentlemen are here to do the same. What? No! No! Carrie, Carrie... Are those classified documents? Don't, don't, don't, don't! No, David, that chart is very important! It is very meaningful! What is wrong with her? No, don't. Don't tell him. David... I am about to solve this f*cking thing! Strip it. No, no, no, no, no! Please, please! Maggie : Carrie, no, come on. We need to sit down right now. Come with me. I'm serious! We're gonna sit down right... - Please, just let me hold onto it for a little while... Estes : How long has she been like this? No! You don't... you don't know what you're doing! Carrie? You don't know what you're doing! We're just gonna... No! David, this isn't...! (overlapping shouts)
