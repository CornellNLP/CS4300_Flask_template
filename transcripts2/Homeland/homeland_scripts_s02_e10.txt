 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan :  This relentless pursuit of terror. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... 
 Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. 
 This was an act of terrorism. 
 It was a despicable and cowardly act. 
 The next samba we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. 
 ...until something stops him. 
 Carrie :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. 
 Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. 
 Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? f*ck! Carrie :  I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Previously on How come I've never heard of this guy? Virgil : Who, Quinn? Just check around. Saul : So he met some guy on a city bus? You know him? Dar Adal. That's Dar Adal? That's him, in the flesh. Hello? Brody  (over phone): - Hey, it's me. Carrie, I need you to go get my family right away. Take them somewhere safe. The CIA sent me, Jess. There's a threat. Whoa! This is sick! Thank you..or being here. Carrie, he's here; he's in America. Abu Nazir? How is that even possible? Jesus Christ! Carrie :  If that's the device, it's at least 200 pounds. Tac One, Tac Two, Tac Three, move now. Over. (tires screeching) (gunshots) MAN:  FBI! Show me your hands! Carrie : It's not him. It's not Abu Nazir. Estes  (over radio): Stand down. We still need him. I say again, stand down. What the hell are  you  doing here? We got 'em, Brody. Your information was good. Got 'em all? All but Nazir-- he's still out there. Walter's Waffles for lunch every Tuesday. Some habits die hard, I guess. Little things I can count on mean more and more to me as I get older. Do you find that? (sighs) I find that everything means more to me as I get older. (chuckles) Plus, I've got a crush on Berta. I went by your house. Oh... New owners. Nice people. There's no point in keeping a house anymore-- I have to move every few weeks. Christ, I miss the Cold War. Prefer the daily threat of nuclear annihilation? No, I miss the rules. The Soviets didn't shoot us; we didn't shoot them. Boy, this bunch... Thought you retired. (chuckles): - Oh... Oh, I tried, I tried. Tell me about Peter Quinn. Peter Quinn? You met with him last night around 8:00. Number seven bus. Who's asking? Me. Just you? Peter Quinn is one of mine. Why would Estes put a off-the-book black ops guy in charge of a straight-up intelligence operation? He didn't tell me; he just asked for a soldier. Soldiers kill people. They also fix airplane engines and cook bad food-- it was a figure of speech. Maybe Estes put Quinn in there just to keep his eye on you. Maybe he doesn't trust you. Why wouldn't he trust me? You still afraid to get your hands dirty, Saul? I still prefer to figure the problem out, not obliterate it. You're too sensitive for this line of work, you always have been. I'm amazed you've lasted this long. Me, too. Has Brody called? Not yet. He will. (sighs): - I know. Listen, Jessica, about last night... Hey, shh. I loved last night. It was fun. It was, wasn't it? Yeah, it was. I keep waiting to feel guilty. (door opening) Brody. I'll be next door. Welcome home. Pretty posh. Thanks for helping out, Mike. No problem. Let me go pack my bags. Everything good? Everything's great. Chris : Hey, Dad. Hey, buddy. Come here. Hi, Dad. Mike : I'll be heading out. You guys need anything else, give me a holler. Bye. See you around. (door closes) Dad? Are you a spy now? No. No, I'm just a congressman who helped the CIA. So you won't be disappearing again? No. I'm not going anywhere. I've got homework. Jessica : You, too. You got a book report to write. (sighs) So, what happens next? Do we get to go home? Not quite yet. Well, the kids can't miss any more school without falling behind. They're going stir-crazy. I noticed. So am I. I noticed. It's good that Mike was here. Yeah. It helped. What are we doing? I don't know. (phone ringing) Dana told me it was Carrie that stopped you from letting her go to the police. Yes, it was. (phone continues ringing) Go ahead, answer it. Hello? Hey. Hey. So, the attorney general's ready to honor our agreement with you, but as we discussed, there are few things you'll need to do first. Resign from Congress? For starters. You'll also have to tell Walden that you're passing on the VP spot. The press are gonna have a lot of questions when you do, so we're gonna have to figure out what you're gonna say. (sighs) I could say it's personal. Just decided to put family before politics. How  is  the family? I honestly don't know. Well, you can all go home soon. That should help. (wry laugh) You okay? Yeah. Yeah. You? It's good to hear your voice. Yours, too. Talk to you later. (phone beeps) Radio Newswoman : Market stocks fell for a fifth day, led by resources... (changing stations) (trumpet playing mid-tempo jazz) The President of the United States..ersonally called the director this morning and congratulated him on a job well done. Estes : That's the good news. The bad news is, we still don't have Abu Nazir yet. With FBI help, we've dropped a net over the DC metro area. Maryland, the Virginia State Police and the National Guard have joined the search. (quietly): Find Adal? What did he say? Quinn is one of his. Virgil : So what's he doing here? That's a good question. There'll be plenty of time for celebrating after we get Nazir. I am personally looking forward to at least several martinis. I had a talk with Dar Adal. He confirmed that Peter Quinn, or whatever his real name is, comes from his side of things. So again I ask... What's he doing on my operation? His  operation, Saul. It's his operation. And now it's over. Is it? Yes. Why is he still here? Brody knows that you and Walden ordered a drone strike against a madrassa full of kids. So? So it could be that Quinn's an insurance policy against that information ever becoming public. An  insurance  policy? Just what exactly are you implying? Only that you and Walden went to great lengths once before to cover up the drone strike. Is this an accusation? I'm only asking a question, David. Well, goddamn it, Saul, I'm not gonna dignify it with answer. Is that a yes? f*ck you, Saul. f*ck you! Quinn : Am I interrupting? No. What's up? Carrie's been in an accident. DC police found her car on 17th Street all smashed up. It was broad-sided. Is she hurt? They can't find her. What do you mean, they can't find her? She's not there. They're looking in local hospitals. Get over to 17th Street. He knows. Oh, you dog. Sorry. Are you hustling me? (doorbell rings) Our friends at Secret Service reached out to us. Finn Walden wants to come and visit Dana. He says it's important. Finn Walden wants to pay Dana a visit. I don't think she'd like that. Shouldn't we ask her? Ask me what? Finn wants to come see you. Why? Jessica : I don't know. He says it's important. He's been texting me all day. He sounds like a mess. Okay. I'll let them know. Thanks. (phone ringing, door closes) (Brody pants heavily) Are you alone? No. I will call you back in one minute. Sorry. It's work. (door opens) Hey. I'm just stretching my legs. Mm-hmm. (indistinct chatter) (elevator bell dings) (phone rings) What the f*ck have you done to Carrie? Did you think it would be easy? That you could betray me and just walk away? It's over. Get that into your f*cking your head! It's not over. Let me talk to her, goddamn it! Nicholas, calm down. If you want to help her, you will do exactly as I tell you. I need you to get into the vice president's home office. Why? There's a treadmill in there. Somewhere near it, there is a plastic case the size of a book. Inside that, there is a serial number. How the f*ck do you know all this? New York Times,  believe it or not. (sighs) Get me the number. Why? Tell me, goddamn it! (panting) Walden has a bad heart. So? His pacemaker can be wirelessly accessed with that number. You're sh1tting me. I'm not. I won't do it. Yes, you will. No. I won't. (panting) Nazir? Nazir? (panting) Send me the number, or I will kill her. Oh, you'll kill her anyway. Right here. Right now. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, just... Nazir? Nazir?! (panting loudly) (panting) (heavy door closing) (panting) (door opening) Chris : Hey, Dad? We gonna finish our game of Hearts? Not now. (sighs) (touch tones sounding, door closing) (phone rings, indistinct chatter) Carrington. Jim? It's Nick Brody. Is the vice president there? Oh, he's in a meeting with the Israeli ambassador. Great. I need to talk to him. Something of an emergency. Well, I can't interrupt the meeting. All right. I understand. Uh, I'll be over. Will you keep him there? I'll do my best, Congressman. I got a small cyclone stirring over the matter of wheat subsidies. I got to go talk to the vice president. Of course. I'll need a car to take us to the naval observatory in ten minutes? Thanks. (panting) (groans softly, feet scraping on floor) (grunting) (panting loudly) (groaning) (panting loudly) (groans) (whimpers) (groans) (groaning) (groaning) (groaning) (heavy door closes) (crying) (whimpers) (groans) (yelling) (loud groaning) (groaning) (loud panting) (loud panting) (fastener whirring) (groans softly) (loud panting) (panting continues) 
 
 (indistinct radio transmission, distant siren wailing) Oh. Oh, where the f*ck are you, Carrie? (indistinct radio transmission) There's no record of her at any of the local hospitals or emergency rooms. Cops are still canvassing the neighborhood. We might get lucky. Lucky? No one saw the crash? Well, one guy says he saw a woman running away. Another says he saw a guy dragging a woman into another car. Any surveillance tape? There's cameras all over the place down here. Well, the cops are collecting what they can find. Our computers will run a search. We dropped the ball. Never should have let Carrie wander around unprotected. If it's Nazir, what's he up to? Maybe Carrie's his bargaining chip to get himself out of the country. Then why haven't we heard from him? I don't know. (indistinct chatter) (phone ringing) Carrie? Is that you? Brody, this is Saul Berenson. I'm calling on her phone. Carrie's missing. Police found her car over on 17th Street, smashed to sh1t. Looks like some kind of hit-and-run. Last number she called was you. What she say? She tell you where she was going? Brody, you there? Yeah, I'm here. Well, what did she say? Oh, she told me it was time to tell Walden that I could no longer be a candidate for VP. That's it? We also discussed my resigning from Congress. If you hear from her again, let me know. I will. What are you guys doing here? In hiding or something? Turns out my dad is, like, a super spy, and terrorists want to kill him or some sh1t. I don't know. That sounds kind of insane. Doesn't it. How come you didn't answer any of my texts? What do you want, Finn? Every morning I wake up, and for a few brief seconds, I'm free. I can just..ook at the sky, or... listen to the birds. (laughs) And then..ham. I remember the sound of that woman hitting the windshield. I remember that I've killed another human being, and I can't take it back. You're the only one I can talk to about it. It makes me sick that..ou hate me. Did you know what your dad would do? That he would pay them off? That's how the world works. I didn't know that, I guess. Remember that night..op of the Washington Monument? Can't we start over? Whatever we felt..e broke it. We killed it..ust the same way that we killed that woman. Virgil : That's Nazir less than 20 minutes before Carrie's accident. Security cameras caught him. That's his car. We traced the license plate. He probably used a fake ID; it's a rental. Where is this place? Five blocks from where Carrie's car was hit on 17th Street. f*ck you doing here? You're supposed to be in Walter Reed. I heard about Carrie. I want to help. Virgil : Here, take a look at this. (clattering) (gasps) No. (water splashing) As you please. This is what you did to Brody, isn't it? A lot of pain, a little love. Am I supposed to feel grateful? I don't care what you feel. There's no way he can just waltz into the naval observatory and get you that serial number. He's a resourceful man when he wants to be. Not that resourceful. He will do it to save you. You're going to kill me no matter what happens. Brody knows that. A man gambles with what he has. He will try. Don't be so sure. He's smarter than you think. You love him, too. Perhaps we have that in common. We have nothing in common. Sometimes, when you're breaking a man, an emotional transference takes place. For me, with Nicholas, it was quite powerful. It was really a kind of love. You're never going to leave this country alive. I know and I don't care. Bullshit. (sighs) You can't even imagine that, can you? Believing in something bigger than you, more important than you? We are at war, I am a soldier. You're a terrorist. Imagine you are sitting down to dinner with your wife and children. Out of the sky, as if thrown by an angry god, a drone strike hits and destroys all of them. Who is the terrorist? It's the last day of Ramadan. A young man enters a Shia village, pushing a cart full of candy and toys. He waits in the school playground for all the children to gather. Then he reaches back and flips a switch. We fight with what we have. You pervert the teachings of the Prophet and call it a cause. You turn teenagers into suicide bombers. Generation after generation must suffer and die. We are prepared for that. Are you? Whatever it takes. (sighs) (chuckles) Really? With your pension plans and organic foods, your beach houses and sports clubs? Do you have the perseverance, the tenacity, the faith? Because we do. You can bomb us, starve us, occupy our holy places, but we will never lose our faith. We carry God in our hearts, our souls. To die is to join him. It may take a century, two centuries, three centuries, but we will exterminate you. Like I said..ou're a terrorist. Man : ID, please. Ma'am. I've got Congressman Brody for the vice president. (window rolls up) ♪ Stacy. Congressman Brody. Hello. I'm sorry, but the vice president's still in his meeting with Ambassador Elon. Oh, no worry, I'll wait. Might be a while. I don't mind. Can I get you anything-- water, lemonade? Double shot of your best bourbon. Just kidding, I'm fine. (exhales) Nature calls. Gentlemen, bathroom? Thank you. ♪ (exhales) (panting) ♪ (indistinct chatter, footfalls approaching) (chatter and footfalls subside) (touch tones sounding) (line ringing) Nazir : Nicholas? I've got the number. Text it to me. Let Carrie go first. Text me the number, then I will let her go. No, you won't. Once you've got what you need, you'll kill her. The minute I let her go, you won't text me the number. God, you've got to trust me. How could I possibly trust you? Send me the number or I will kill her. Nazir, if you kill her, you will never get this number. (panting) You have five seconds. Listen to me, listen to me, Nazir, listen. Let Carrie go and I swear I will send it to you. I swear on the soul of Issa. Why would I believe that? Because you know how much I loved him. And because you know how much I hate Walden. He deserves to die for what he did. And what he will do as president. Swear again. I swear. I swear. Swear on the immortal soul of my son Issa Mohammed. I swear. I s... I swear..n Issa's..mmortal soul. Nazir? Nazir?! Go. Go! Go. (panting) (groans) Let me see her, goddamn it! I want to see her actually getting away, Nazir. (Brody panting) It's too dark. It's too dark, Nazir. I can't see her. Nazir : She's gone. Send me the number. Send me the number now. Send me the number or I will go after her. (horn honking) Asshole! (beeping) (phone chimes) (phone beeps) (keys clacking) (object clatters) There you are. I thought you left. Getting a feel for the joint? Yeah. Hope you don't mind. Not at all. Be yours soon enough. You all right? What's the matter? Yeah, I'm fine. How was, uh... how was your meeting with, uh, Ambassador Elon? We're getting close. Another week or so, we'll be ready to deliver the bunker buster Israel needs to take out Iran's nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz. I thought that was off the table. It was. Estes told me what you did for CIA. Not the details, of course, but..e said you were instrumental in bringing down Nazir's network. I was able to help a little, yes. How do you manage to do all that and keep it to yourself? I don't know. (chuckles) As soon as I can get that operation declassified, we are gonna tell this whole f*cking country what you did. "Marine Fights Terrorists at Home as Well as Abroad." What did you want to see me about? Right. Right, um... Well, sir, uh... I'm afraid..hat in fact this can never be mine. Why not? Because... I've decided to withdraw my name from consideration for the VP spot. I'm sorry, sir. It's for my family. f*ck your family. We're talking about the second highest office in this land, the possibility someday of the highest office in this land. You don't walk away from that. Not for anyone. (keys clacking) (grunts) (grunting) You okay? (grunts) (strained): I don't know. Actually, it's not for my family. It's for me. (rhythmic beeping) Because I want to feel clean again. And because I pretty much disagree with everything you say and do. (rhythmic beeping) That's very funny. You got some balls, Brody. I'll give you that. I'm not joking. (grunts) (grunting) (rapid beeping) (groans) (grunts) (strained): Call a doctor. I don't think so. Goddamn... (grunting) What are you doing? Huh? What are you doing?! (grunts) You still don't get it, do you? (grunting) (quietly): I'm killing you. (grunting) (Walden panting) (grunts) (sustained beep tone) (Brody breathing unsteadily) (sighs) (speaks Arabic) (beep) (horn honking) (brakes screech) Man : Are you f*cking nuts? Jesus. What happened to you? Give me your cell phone. I'm not giving you my f*cking cell phone. This is a matter of national security. Give me your f*cking cell phone! No! Hey! Hey! Come back with that! (phone rings) Yeah. Saul, it's Carrie. Carrie, where the f*ck are you? Abu Nazir is in an abandoned mill. Where? I have no idea. Man : Give me my phone, - you bitch! Where are we? Where the f*ck are we?! What? We're on Highway 50. Where on Highway 50? East of Chantilly. Highway 50, east of Chantilly. We'll find you. Stay put. Do not go after Nazir. We're on our way. Highway 50, east of Chantilly. Here. I'm sorry. It was an emergency. "National emergency." East of Chantilly, east of Chantilly. 50, 50. There. Dalton's Mill. Halfway between Middleburg and Chantilly... Estes : Okay, call state police and tell 'em to surround the place. Then grab every available body and get over there! Yes, sir. Estes : I'll alert the FBI and the rest of Homeland Security. (panting) Hey, get a doctor! I need a doctor! The vice president is having a heart attack! Will somebody get a doctor?! Saul Berenson? Yes? You're wanted upstairs. Upstairs? What for? It's important. That's all they told me. I'm on my way to catch a terrorist. What could be more important than that? They didn't say. (sighs) Jesus Christ. Go ahead. I'll catch up. Who's asking for me? I don't know, sir. What do you mean you don't know? Who told you to get me? They just want to ask you some questions, sir. Questions? They? What the f*ck are you talking about? There's a room waiting for us downstairs. I thought you said we were going upstairs. Who the f*ck... Hey, hey! Get your f*cking hands off me. Call Deputy Director Estes. He'll straighten this out. He's fully aware. (panting) (detector beeping) (metal object scrapes) (door creaks) (door slams) (clattering in distance)
