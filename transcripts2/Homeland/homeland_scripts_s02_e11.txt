 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan :  This relentless pursuit of terror. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... 
 Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. 
 This was an act of terrorism. 
 It was a despicable and cowardly act. 
 The next samba we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. 
 ...until something stops him. 
 Carrie :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. 
 Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. 
 Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? f*ck! Carrie :  I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Previously on Listen, Jessica, about last night... Hey, I loved last night. I felt happier than I felt in a long time. Who does know the plan to attack America? Roya Hammad. She's at a window counter with her camera crew. If that's the device, it's at least 200 pounds. Tac one, Tac two, Tac three, move now. Over. (tires screeching) FBI! Show your hands! Carrie : It's not him. It's not Abu Nazir. Estes  (over radio): Stand down. We still need him. I say again, stand down. What the hell are you doing here? Adal :  Peter Quinn  is one of mine. Why would Estes put a off-the-book black ops guy in charge of a straight-up intelligence operation? He just asked for a soldier. Soldiers kill people. Carrie's been in accident-- DC police found her car on 17th Street all smashed up-- it was broadsided. Is she hurt? They can't find her. What the f*ck have you done to Carrie? If you want to help her, you will do exactly as I tell you. Walden has a bad heart. His pacemaker can be accessed wirelessly. Send me the number, or I will kill her. (groaning) Call a doctor. I'm killing you. Saul, it's Carrie. Carrie, where the f*ck are you? Abu Nazir is in an abandoned mill. We'll find you. Stay put. Do not go after Nazir. Saul Berenson? Yes. You're wanted upstairs. I'm on my way to catch a terrorist. What could be more important than that? They didn't say. (breathing heavily) (exhales) (footsteps nearby) (grunts, clattering) (breathing heavily) Man  (distantly): Show your hands! Show your hands! Quinn  (normal): Lower your weapons-- she's with us! Man : All right, leaders on me. Stand down, weapons set. Carrie? He was there. He was right in front of me, we go to go get him. We will, but you stay here. Bravo team. Make entry. Yes, sir! Alpha team! We're on it. Secure the perimeter. Man : Bravo team, move in! Carrie... I'm taking you to the medic. N-No. It's not for discussion; you're shaking. He was right in front of me. I-I don't know how I lost him. You sure it was Nazir? Yeah. I followed him into the tunnels right after I called Saul. From where? Uh..omewhere here, right..ight by where he was holding me. By a road. Close by, then? Yeah. I-I wasn't below ground that long. How did you get away? I escaped. How? I was lucky. (gasping breath) I-I'm freezing. Come on. Where's Saul? He's stuck at Langley. Probably tied up with the vice president situation. What situation? Oh, right, you missed it. Walden died. How? Heart attack, in his house. Apparently, his pacemaker malfunctioned. So sit, do whatever this guy tells you. I'll be right back, hopefully with Nazir, okay? Jessica : Can't sleep? Me, either. I spoke to Cynthia. How's she holding up? Barely. Whatever else, they were married for 30 years. She said she was glad you were with him when he died. It's all changed, hasn't it? Now that Bill's gone. Well, I'm not gonna be vice president, if that's what you mean. That's not what I meant. I mean, it's  all  changed. Everything. I keep asking myself how we even got here. Things just happened. Opportunities they seem like. We just went along, one thing to the next. I think maybe this is a time to stop and think. (sighs) (sighs) What is it? Just tell me. (phone buzzing) (phone continues buzzing) I think I should probably... Yeah. Hello? It's me. So you're okay? Yeah. (sighs) Where are you? Near where he had me. They're looking for him. Who is? Everyone. Nearly half a dozen Tac teams. There's no way out; we'll get him this time. Quinn already asked me, uh..ow I got away. What did you tell him? That I escaped. Good. But what's Nazir gonna say when we get him? It doesn't matter. It does. (whispers): Walden's dead. Look... all that matters to me right now is that you're safe. I got to go. (sighs) Larry. Saul. So this is what Estes is up to. What's that? This. You. A polygraph. Calm down. Which he's using for one reason..o keep me locked away in a room. I wouldn't know. You do know; I just told you. Saul... we all agree to this. Section 17-dot-three of your employment contract. Fine. You really have to  calm down. Why the f*ck should I? You'll fail the test. Fail the test? What is this, middle school? Of course I'm gonna fail the test. The test is a goddamn farce. Not to Estes it's not. He seemed very serious about it. Could you stand up for me? Mm-hmm. Just hold that there. So, what's the pretext? What do you mean? - I mean, what are you even gonna ask me about? Company vehicles? Excessive use of office supplies? I'm just here to set up the machine. (door opens) He'll be asking all the questions. Who the f*ck are you? Newswoman : He was Director of the CIA for three and a half tumultuous years before being elected vice president. Walden attended Notre Dame, where he was an All-American running back. Vice President of the United States-- you'd think they could find something more vivid to say than he played football in college. Tac teams completed the initial sweep-- no Nazir. That's not possible. I was right on his heels. I know. But I think we've got to concede that he might have gotten out of here. We've got two members of Nazir's network back at Langley waiting to be interrogated. You really think he got out of here past all of  this? I'm saying it looks that way. Then he had help; he must have. From whom? Well, why did we put this operation off grid in the first place? Because we've had leaks all along the way. - So you think one of our people is working against us? What, you have another explanation? Yeah, Nazir got away before we even got here. I told you, he was right there! I heard him! Okay, we'll take another look. Hey, guys, let's go. We're going back in. Let's try again. (clears throat) Is your name Saul Berenson? Yes. Are you sometimes called "The Bear"? f*ckin' hope not. No. Are you presently in Alabama? No. Do you intend to answer truthfully here today? (sighs) Do you intend to answer truthfully here today? Yes. I'd prefer this not take all night. See, I think you'd prefer that it did. Are you acquainted with Aileen Morgan? Yes. I was. Are you aware that she killed herself? Yes. Were you with Aileen when she died? Yes. Was Aileen a terrorist? She said she was. Yes or no. Yes. Do you live on Tripoli Lane? No. Did you provide the weapon Aileen Morgan used to kill herself? What? Answer the question. Is that what this is about? I provided the weapon? Did you provide the weapon Aileen Morgan used to kill herself? You tell Estes no matter how many bullshit charges he trumps up, I'm onto him. He wants to frame me for her death? Go ahead, try. You know what this is really about? Do you? A plan to assassinate a U.S. Congressman the second Abu Nazir is out of the picture. Why don't you ask me a few questions about that? Did you provide the weapon Aileen Morgan used to kill herself? Carrie : ...five, six, seven. Okay, who else? A team is eight members, right? Yes. Could you join us, please? Over here? Okay, so who was responsible for directing the actual search? Carrie... Excuse me, please. What are you doing? I want to talk to the people who cleared the tunnel. Talk to them? To ask them a few questions. Like what? If they're working for the other side? They are all ex-military. So? So you do not want to be questioning their loyalty on a hunch. I told you, if Nazir got away someone must have helped him. These guys work in pairs, you know that right? So do you want to explain to me how one of them is helping Nazir while his buddy's looking over his shoulder? Or is it more than one? Or all of them? Or one big conspiracy? Who was there from our side? Who was directing the search? Which of our people? Me. (sighs) - Who else? Does that mean you trust me? Who else? Galvez. Uh, Danny Galvez. Where is he? I'll poll security. Galvez-- does it even make sense? I don't know. I... He took a bullet in the tailor shop. Well, Nazir has a history of sacrificing his own people. Did he even have access? The leaks over the past year, does Galvez make sense? It might. (sighs) What? He is a Muslim. Man : Galvez cleared security at main gate two minutes ago. He's driving north. He has Nazir. Shut the outer perimeter. I want that car stopped now. Bravo team, with us! Bravo, mount up. (siren wailing) Man : Eagle, this is Unit Four. We have target vehicle in sight. (over radio): Approaching blockade and counting five. (indistinct radio transmission) (siren wailing) Put your hands on the wheel where we can see them! Do not move! Carrie : Can you see him? Nazir? Quinn : Not yet. Is he armed? Can't tell. Let's get them out of there. Let's go! Out of the car. (grunts) - What the? On the ground. Get down. Now. (grunting) Galvez : Carrie. What are you doing? Carrie : Shut up. No weapons. He's clean. Clear! There's no one else in the vehicle! Where is he? (groans) Goddamn it, Danny, where did you take him? Who? Abu Nazir, where is he? Quinn : Carrie. Tell me! Quinn : Carrie! He's bleeding. My stitches ripped open. I was going to the hospital. All right, let him up. Man : Yes, sir. (Galvez groaning) Let's get a medic. Ah, Jesus. (Galvez groaning, panting) (Carrie sighs) Morning. (scoffs) You have any idea where your mother is? (scoffs) Probably in the bathroom crying. I mean, if last night is any indication. (pours cereal) (sighs) Here, take mine. No, thanks. I didn't touch it. Yeah, well, I'm not going to either. You know, there's a 7-Eleven half a block away. They have milk. It's too bad we can't go there. Want to tell me what's bugging you? Nothing is "bugging me." I just want to go to school. Most parents would be thrilled. I thought we were doing better. Yeah, well, I guess not. I swear to God, if I have to listen to another minute of  Kuma War, I am going to kill someone. (game stops) Dad! Dana. What are we doing here? Could someone please tell me that? I told you. Yeah, you told me something that did not make any sense. 
 
 (door opens) (door closes) I got more milk. They actually let you leave? Major Mendez got it for me. Brody : Okay now? Dana? Why? What's wrong? Dana : Nothing. Oh, f*ck! Jessica : Dana. This is leaking. It's disgusting! Oh! I am so sick of this! Dana. What are we even doing here?! We're only here a while longer. Why are  you  even here?! Why do you not just go live with that crazy woman and leave us alone! Jessica : Hey. Chris : No, Dana, shut up! We're better off with Mike, all of us. He has been a better father to us than you ever were! Jessica : I don't think we should be making any decisions right now. Dana : Yeah. Any of us. We need to just stop. Until we get home. To our house. And then we'll figure everything out. (sighs) Quinn :  You can't blame yourself. Sure. If communication had been better, we would've known Galvez was on his way to the hospital. Estes : Hey. I heard about the ugliness out there. It was my fault. It's done. So, where are we now? I just want to get Nazir. Excuse me, I've waited two days to wash my face. I'm, uh, having Roya Hammad moved to Interrogation B like you asked. Good. We'll get on her. Not "we." I want you to question her. Well, Carrie knows more about her network. Agreed, but... Nazir could be anywhere. We're not gonna find him without some help. We need to take our best shot at this, and after what Carrie's just pulled, I doubt that's her. Okay. Let me know how it goes. (door opens) (moans) (hisses) (sighs) (softly): Oh, God. (sighs) (sighs) (gasps) (gasps) (sighs) (exhales) (sniffles) (sighs) (chains clanking) (beep) (door closes) Carrie : I spent an afternoon with him. Abu Nazir. He put a gun to my head and came very close to pulling the trigger. He did this to me, and, uh, he did this. (scoffs) He was surprisingly frank. He told me it would take centuries to defeat the unbelievers, and he didn't care how many casualties there would be. On either side, how many people died... ...it's of no concern. I think that's him. Not you. You were a student and then a reporter, but you were never a soldier. You've never been there, at ground zero, when the bomb goes off, knowing all that death is on you. The naval base attack would have been the first time. 300 men and women coming home. Their families waiting for them. Their children. All just..lown to pieces. But it didn't happen. (sighs) And now you have a second chance. Take it. Because I think there's some part of you that's relieved that bomb never went off. sh1t. Carrie  (over speaker): Roya, what he does, which is kill innocent people... ...it's justified by a future which... (sighs) ...for the life of me I can't believe you actually want. How could you know what I want? I know it's not that. I-I understand that this is personal for you. That your family lost land to the occupation. That your grandfather was killed. But Nazir can't change that. His only answer is perpetual war. (sighs) Roya. Have you ever..ave you ever had someone who somehow..akes over your life, pulls you in..ets you to do things that aren't really you? That you know are wrong... ...but you can't help yourself? Do you have anyone like that? Yes. Well... I've never been that stupid. You idiot whore, you think you understand me?! Or what my family, have lost and suffered?! You think this is just some f*cking game? Nazir's not afraid of you, I'm not. I don't need your help, I don't want it. (speaks Arabic) (continues in Arabic) I'm gonna have someone take you home. No. I'm not asking. You've been up for a day and a half. I f*cked it up in there. Our chance to get Nazir. f*ck. We'll see. Go home and get some rest, okay? I'm gonna deal with Roya and I'll keep you posted. Nothing's gonna happen without you, I promise. Thanks for getting this done so quickly. My pleasure. How'd it go? It's all there, everything you wanted. I quizzed him on the main topics we discussed. The illegal surveillance of Sergeant Brody, the death of Aileen Morgan, general insubordination. Plus a couple of detours I found along the way. So we're done. You've got enough there to do what you want. You can fire him, tie him up in administrative proceedings for the next decade, refer him to harsher interrogations. I'm hoping none of that will be necessary. Yeah, sure, goes without saying. Funny detail, though. He went on this crazy rant about an assassination plot against a U.S. Congressman. The machine said he was telling the truth. I'm calling it an anomaly. Thought it was best to leave it out. (exhales) (horn honks) (horn blaring) (horn blares) (phone ringing) You home yet? Carrie : I'm not going home. Carrie... Listen to me. Something Roya said was bothering me. She said Nazir wouldn't run. From you, she said. (speaks Arabic) From me, from whomever, it means run, literally. Not back down, not be afraid of. Run. As in movement. What if Nazir didn't run and we're looking in all the wrong places? So what are the right places? Back in the tunnels. Nazir never left. We searched the tunnels. I know. With multiple teams. If Nazir was hiding in there, we'd have found him. This has happened before. His just vanishing right under our noses like a magic trick. I'm heading back there. Quinn, I'm heading back. I'll be there soon. Where is everyone? All done. Where are the Tac teams? Them, too. Left a while ago. There might be one crew still here, over behind that building. Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Don't let anyone else leave! Stop! Stop! (tires screeching) Thank God. What is it? We need to sweep the tunnels. We did. One last time. Ma'am, we've been called back to Langley. Tell Peter Quinn. He'll give you whatever authorization you need. Please. Our target, I think he's still here. The results of your polygraph session. Open it, take a look. I don't need to. I know what's in there. I also know why you did it. And why's that? Because I was right..ou're planning a hit on Brody. You want me out of the way where I can't interfere. So you trumped that up. There's nothing trumped up there, Saul. That's a product of standard agency procedures. f*ck you. How you going to do, huh? How you going to do on the polygraph when they ask if you ever executed a member of Congress? We both know what Brody is, and congressman is the least of it. We have a deal with him. We don't make deals with terrorists, and if he's confused about that, or you are, that's not my problem. What is my problem is the way you continually undermine me. I can't allow it. You're through here. I want you gone. What the official story is, that's up to you, but I will use this to tie you up in hearing after hearing for the rest of your natural life if I have to. You think about that. (door closes) Mind if I ask? What happened to your face? This guy we're looking for-- he did that. You're the one he held hostage. Yeah. Why you? (sighs) What is it? This wall right here. What about it? These conduits are passing right through it. Yeah. At ceiling height, like there's a room back there. There's something back there. Let's see. (metallic scraping) ♪ ♪ Holy sh1t. You're right, he was here. No more, though. He can't be far. Bravo, come in. (static crackles over comm unit) Bravo, you there? f*ck. I'll get them. Yeah, go. (man grunts) (thud) (grunting) Help! He's here, he's here! Help, he's here! He's here! (panting) Help! (panting) ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ (gasps) (both grunting) TAC Team Member : Movement up ahead. Stay down. Who's got eyes on him? I got him, I got him. Do not move. (gunshots) (gasps) (gasping) (panting) (indistinct radio transmission) Good work. I'm told he would have gotten away again if not for you. Not just me. Oh, well, you were the one always had a sixth sense about him. The president will be thanking the agency at a press conference within the hour. It's a big day. For all of us. You must be very happy. Excuse me. (sighs) (sniffles) (sniffling) They're moving the Brody family back to their house. Their security detail will be dismantled within the hour. So it's a go? Yes. It'll be risky now. Everyone will be looking to Brody for a sound bite about Abu Nazir. I'd still like it handled as soon as possible. It'll look like blowback for us getting Nazir. (indistinct radio transmission) (sighs) (footsteps approaching) Brody. Is there something wrong? Mendez : Not at all. I told Mrs. Brody, we were just notified that Abu Nazir has been killed. Chris : It's good news, right? (gasps) Dana : Dad? Brody? (crying) (sniffles) (sighs) Yeah. Mendez : You're all safe now, Congressman. Yeah, of course. You can all go home. Dana : Never in my life have I been so happy to be home. Chris : I kind of miss that place. Dana  (scoffs): You would. They made your bed for you. That was mom, you moron. Really? I guess it's time to say good-bye to Major Mendez. Hi. So, this is it. We're all set. Mendez : Okay. Jessica : Thank you very much. Okay. (door opening) (door closing) You coming? (car door opening) Brody? I can't. (sighs) (sighs) I don't want to fight any more. Even  for  something. I'm tired of fighting. Me, too. We were okay for so long. You know? Since we were 16, and all we wanted was to be together, we were so okay. I know. Was it Mike? No. Because... No, it wasn't. You know that. I tried, Brody. (sighs) I really tried. I just keep wishing that I'd been bigger somehow, able to give you..hat you needed to be okay again after you got back, but I couldn't. You did fine. It was just... beyond me. Jess... (sighs) There was nothing  anyone  could have done. Even me. Because I tried, too. To deal with everything that happened. But th..hat was beyond me. I was f*cked the moment I left for Iraq. We all were. (sniffles) The time Carrie came..ame over here to the house... ...on the day that Elizabeth Gaines was shot and Tom Walker died... ...Carrie said some..ome crazy things to Dana and to you. (sighs) She said things about what I was going to do. Don't. Not now. (cries) For the longest time, all I wanted was for you to tell me the truth. I wanted to know it all. I don't have to know anymore. I just don't want to. Carrie knows, right? She knows everything about you. She accepts it. (voice breaking): You must love her a lot. What will we tell the kids? (sighs) Nothing they don't already know. (crickets chirping) (door closes) (sighs heavily) (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) (sighs) He's dead. I know. Can't do any more damage. To anyone. What I did to get Nazir to let you go... It was you or Walden, Carrie. It wasn't even close. (door closes) (sighs)
