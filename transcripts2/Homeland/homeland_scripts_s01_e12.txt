 Previously on  Homeland... 
 Walden :  You want your portrait up on the walls  of Langley someday? 
 Find Walker. 
 Walker's not even critical. 
 He's just a part, a piece, a pixel. 
 There is a bigger, pernicious, Abu Nazir-worthy plot out there, and we have little time. 
 Carrie..ou're not yourself. 
 She's bipolar. 
 This explosion must have sent her into a flight. 
 Carrie said something interesting. 
 Sniper attack-- that doesn't make sense for Abu Nazir. 
 It's not his methodology. 
 Well, maybe it is when he has a military sniper working for him. 
 She thinks something bigger. 
 Man :  The switch is here. 
 Wait until the last second before you open it. Brody :  I read that part of the blast goes upward  toward here-- point of weakness. Hello. I'm calling about Abu Nazir. Something happened to him, a tragedy. You were with him then. Y-You have insight. Would it help if we met? I'm home. Stay there. Sergeant Brody called me. He told me everything. Your office at Langley's being cleared as we speak. I am about to solve this f*cking thing! Strip it. Saul :  I'm so sorry. I feel responsible in a way. 'Cause when you came back from Baghdad, I knew. You were damaged. There's no time, Saul. It's high purple. I have a wife..nd two kids..ho I love. By the time you watch this, you'll have read a lot of things about me, about what I've done, and so I wanted to explain myself. So that you'll know the truth. On May 19, 2003, as part of a two-man sniper team serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, I was taken prisoner by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. Those forces then sold me to an al-Qaeda commander-- Abu Nazir, who was operating a terrorist cell from across the Syrian border where I was held captive for more than eight years. I was beaten... I was tortured..nd I was subjected to long periods of total isolation. People will say I was broken, I was brainwashed. People will say that I was turned into a terrorist, taught to hate my country. I love my country. What I am is a marine, like my father before me and his father before him, and as a marine, I swore an oath to defend the United States of America against enemies both foreign and domestic. My action this day is against such domestic enemies-- the vice president and members of his national security team, who I know to be liars and war criminals responsible for atrocities they were never held accountable for. This is about justice for 82 children..hose deaths were never acknowledged and whose murder is a stain on the soul of this nation. Hi. Any change? Afraid not. How worried should we be? Worried. I haven't seen her like this in a long time. She's not eating, she hasn't left her room in three days. What about the lithium? I thought you said that'd be kicking in by now. It has kicked in. This is the depression that comes in the wake of the mania. It's actually much harder to treat. Think some chicken soup would help? It might. Elixir of the gods. Can I go see her? Of course. Saul. What does being on administrative leave mean exactly? Well..he's not going to face any criminal charges, thank God, but we shouldn't kid ourselves. She's never going to set foot in Langley again. Hey, you. Hey, Mr. Berenson. (sniffs) Remember when I used to call you that? What? Mr. Berenson. Yeah... a long-ass time ago. Back when I could still piss in a straight line. How are you, Carrie? I've been better. Don't worry, I can't stay long. (grunts) Why don't you tell me a story? What kind of a story? About a bad man named Nazir who took a break from doing bad things, only nobody could figure out why. You know I can't talk about that. (sighs) I know, until my security clearance is restored. I know. (sighs) You need to concentrate on getting better. At least tell me that you're still looking into it, that you won't give up. You promise me that. (whispering): Promise. (sighs deeply) No, don't go. Why did he do it? Who? Brody. Why? Do what? Call Estes and..at me out like that. Honestly, I can think of a hundred reasons. The man's running for congress in case you forgot. Think about it. You're the last person he needs in his life right now, and vice versa. (sobbing): But, Saul... Listen to me. This man has poisoned your thoughts. He has cost you almost everything. Forget him. I can't, Saul, I can't. My God. You're in love with him. ♪ ♪ (locks door) ♪ ♪ (sniffs) (clanking quietly) Man : It's number O-72. Man : B-15. Good night, Isabelle. (laughs) Good night. (engine starting) (glass clinks) I'm looking at a lot of distinguished faces here tonight. Yours, Elizabeth. The only reason I'm here at all. Thank you for convincing me three years ago to accept the nomination for Vice President. And yours, Richard. You are the core of what I'm confident will be our next administration. We've all been on a long, difficult journey. But tomorrow morning, when I announce my candidacy, we will throw down a gauntlet-- all of us here in this room-- promising to put America first again. All : "Hear! Hear! (crowd chatter) Good to see you, Walt. (indistinct chatter) Very nice. You know, you're right. It's a distinguished group. Includes you, David. It's a group worth protecting, that's my point. If you're asking me to call off tomorrow, you know the answer. I'm only suggesting that we change the venue. So I can announce a candidacy from some hiding place? (sighs) You give them too much credit, you know that? Who's that, sir? The enemy. Guys like Walker. He can do a lot of damage. To both of us. Yes, he can. But he's only one guy, and you have the entire Homeland Security apparatus at your disposal. For both our sakes, take care of it. And for God's sakes, drink your champagne. It's Billecart-Salmon. Yes, sir. (chuckles) Oh, not again. (sighing) I'm sorry, ma'am, but... I know, I know. Residents only. What's it this time? It's a major policy address in the morning. Vice President, I think. Oh, fucker. Ma'am? Serves me right for buying two blocks from the State Department. Well, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Mrs. Sammler. You have a nice night. Officers? (gun clicks) (gasps) Okay, Mrs. Sammler. Knock, knock. Your night nurse is here. I made spaghetti amatriciana. You know, Carrie, you're gonna to have to eat sooner or later. Damn it, Carrie. You are starting to scare me. Go... away. I'm sorry, I can't do that. Your sister gave me very strict orders. So I'm going to sit here with you until you fall asleep. Okay? Hmm. Smells good. You sure you don't want a bite? Jessica :  Chris, can you get the butter out of the fridge? Chris :  Yeah. So you're not coming to my karate match? Brody : Buddy, I told you, I got this event with the Vice President. I'm sorry. Jessica : Chris, we talked about this, right? Your dad'll go to the next one. Right? Right. All right, dinner's ready. Everybody, sit down. (Jessica sighs) (sighs) Whose turn is it to say grace? Mine. Dad, do you know how to do it? I think I can fake it. (laughs) Dear God, bless this food to thy use and our lives to thy service. And may you shine the light of your love on this family..old them close..nd protect them always. Amen. Chris : Amen. Amen. How did I do? Not bad. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Nazir :  The end of our lives is preordained. We are not created for no reason. We are only finding the path we are meant to walk on. So, purify your soul. Forget about the physical world. And take the time left to offer good deeds and obedience. (sighs) Remember: all of life's wasted time is behind you now. And the way forward is clear. You were looking at the battle before you engaged in it, and now you see it with your own eyes. (speaking Arabic) (speaking Arabic) Dad? What are you doing? What's going on? How long have you been standing there? Dana? Dad, you're scaring me. Don't be scared. Was that Arabic? Yeah. What does it mean? It means, um... I converted to Islam. I didn't say anything to anyone, because I didn't want to upset you guys. Well, then, it's a good thing you didn't shoot a deer, or step out on mom, or beat the sh1t out of Mike. Okay, I deserved that. Why do you wash your hands and feet like that? It's a ritual. It's about purifying your mind and body before presenting yourself to God. Does Mom know anything about any of this? No. She wouldn't get it..t all. Our little secret then? Yeah. Man  (over radio): These are the kind of issues facing Vice President Walden this morning as he prepares to give his remarks. The vice president will be joined by staunch supporters from virtually every corner of the defense establishment, including the Secretaries of Defense and State and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, longtime advisor Elizabeth Gaines. The speech comes just days after a bombing in downtown Washington left five people dead and it's clearly time to show..n the next phase of the war on terror. Yet, the exact nature of those measures remain unclear. At the CIA, Walden was widely credited with developing closer ties with the armed forces, taking a more militarized approach to intelligence gathering, and the elimination of insurgents. Under Walden's leadership, the use of drone strikes... Virgilecame a key strategy in the CIA's fight... Virgil, where are my pills? I need them! Vice President Walden has met with political resistance... Virgil? Is anyone there? Virgil : Carrie? (Gasps) I'm right here. Here. Here. (panting) (newscaster continues indistinctly) I need to get out of here. Good. Uh, great. We'll go for a walk, huh? I want to go for a drive. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at the State Department. I need your help with something first. (sighs) What is that? There's an 11-month gap in Abu Nazir's activities. Started around two years ago. He goes silent like he fell off the face of the earth. Theory is, there might have been some event that precipitated this, something that hit him personally, took him out of action for a while. And whose theory is that? Just look at this. It's all redacted. What the hell am I looking at? I think it's a drone strike. Why's that? This reference number here. How'd you find this? Grid search. Cross-referenced with Abu Nazir's likely locations around the time in question..nd I got hundreds of hits. None like this. Can I ask why you were even doing that? I told you, there's a gap. This gap-- is it related to that wall of garbage we found in Carrie's apartment? It was a time line, David. It was classified material, Saul, improperly removed from this office, assembled by a crazy woman into a crazy collage, and I don't even want to know about your involvement in it. Well, ask me. I'll tell you. I said I don't even want to know. I need you too much right now to have you land in custody. I, I need you to do your job. I think I am. You're not. The vice president is hosting a highly visible conference today. I asked you to be our man on the ground there. Go do it. This is good. Excellent-- I can't feel my hands. We ought to sic him on Tom Walker. Okay, let's go. This is good. We're going to be late. Sure you don't want to come? Well, I want to. Then do. Come on, guys, we settled this already. (panting) Next time. Sure. Hey, come on. (laughter) (exclaims) Come on, Bruce Lee, you're going to miss your bout. You got everything? Yeah. Jess. We're gonna be late. I'll see you later. (panting) The turn's right up here. Just going for a little drive, huh? We're driving, aren't we? Yeah. Great. You want to tell me what the hell we're doing here? Getting some fresh air. No, I'm serious, Carrie, I have a van full of equipment, a lot of it not exactly legal. So why are we here? Carrie. In a few hours, the vice president is expected to announce he's a candidate for President. Okay. Up ahead in that building he'll be surrounded by his entire team. I said why are  we  here? Half the government is going to be in one spot and we've got a terrorist on the loose. And you think this is the target. I think it's worth considering. (sighs) Okay, Carrie, look, first of all, we don't have a terrorist on the loose. We don't have anything. You see these guys? They  have a terrorist on the loose and it's their job to do something about it. It's my job. Not anymore it's not. It'll always be my job. Don't you get that? Look around, Carrie. There is security up the wazoo here. They are on it. We are not needed. No, all those guys? They're thinking it's a single sniper. Because that's what it is. No, it's not. It doesn't make sense. Virgil, I... I know I'm not wanted. I know it's just us in this stupid van, but I'm the same person I've always been and I need you to be on my side now. I need you to say yes. Okay. Officer : Come on, you got to back it out. Let's go. Sorry. Made a wrong turn. Find a place to park this thing. (rustling) (sighs deeply) (breathing heavily) (door rattling) Just a minute. The door's locked. I'm getting dressed. Dad, I really don't think you should go to this thing today. This thing..s being hosted by the vice president. So? So..e's counting on me. Ah. To be there. Well, all they're saying on TV is how intense the security is. Most since the inauguration-- that's what they're saying. Well, that's all taken care of. We have nothing to worry about. I guess. Dad. What? Have you noticed how awkward it is, having this conversation through the door? (vehicle stops) I think I heard my car arrive. (clears throat) You let 'em know I'll be a couple minutes? Seeing you praying like that last night, I think it kind of freaked me out. Apparently. As if it's not enough that Tom Walker is running around out there with a gun. You're safe. Don't worry. It's not me that I'm worried about. I'll be fine. Two minutes. I still think that you should stay here. Be good. Sergeant Brody. (door closes) Who are you? Kandarian. Secret Service. I've been assigned to you for the day. (car door closes) Let's go. (engine starts) (siren wailing) Saul Berenson found a redacted document that points to the mission. I thought that paper trail was burned. You and me both. What was he even looking for? He was just fishing for some action that might have caused Abu Nazir to drop out of sight around that time. Based on what? Some theory he has that the current situation is blowback. You tell him it doesn't matter why terrorists do what they do. I have. He's a security expert, he's not a f*cking social worker. I know, I told him to drop it. Don't tell him; Make it happen. This cannot get out. Right? Operation wasn't above my security clearance; It was off the books, or it was taken off after the fact. Yeah, well, you're right. The reference number implies a drone strike. So there's got to be all kinds of supporting documentation, yes? That's the weird thing-- there's not. You check flight plans? Yeah. What about ops tapes? I went down and checked the vault myself. The only thing that exists is this redacted document you found on the grid search. It probably wasn't even supposed to be there. Obviously. I'm stuck here like some school crossing guard just so Estes can feel like his ass is covered. You want me to initiate an official request for information? I have a feeling that's the last thing we want to do. I could reach out to some drone pilots. (metal detector beeping) Officer : Sir. Sorry. No, let's not raise flags. I'll follow up on it myself. (sighs) So what are we looking for exactly? Exactly I don't know. It's not one thing, Virgil, it's everything. All the Defense leaders will be here-- at least two dozen high-value targets. Yeah, so? So a single sniper is not gonna take them all out. So you focus on the highest value target. But why here with all the security? That's exactly what I've been saying. You attack here if you're planning to take them all out. A group of people who are almost never in the same place at the same time. Gaines : I'd really rather talk about this conference and our need to rededicate our efforts to the war on terror. Reporter : Is that a course that the vice president would pursue as commander in chief? Gaines : He'll be here shortly; you can ask him yourself. But the fact is, we are not comfortable with a war... (indistinct radio transmission) We're on the wrong side of the barrier, Virgil. I agree. Now, come on. Let's go home. Carrie, you are working yourself up for nothing. I wouldn't call a possible terrorist attack nothing. Shh! You can't say stuff like that. Not here. Don't worry, everything's fine. Is that what you want to hear? (helicopter flying nearby) It's a bit excessive, isn't it, all this security? (knocking on window) Windows open, please. IDs? Sergeant Brody. Sure. Sorry about the inconvenience. (bangs on car) Good to go! Brody? What's he doing here? Uh, do me a favor; Don't ask him. I'm standing here because of him. I lost my job because of him. Carrie, we really should go now. Carrie! Goddamn it, Carrie. Nervous? Well... I'll be standing in there with..wo cabinet secretaries, couple of joint chiefs, head of Defense Intelligence. I'm just a platoon sergeant. Gaines : You'll get used to it. He's here. Sergeant Brody. Sir. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Ms. Gaines, nice to see you again. Gaines : And you. Mr. Vice President. Thanks for coming out. Thank you for having me, sir. (crowd screaming) (clamoring) (gunshot) (frantic shouting) sh1t. (gunshot) (metal detectors beeping) Virgil : We have to get out of here. Come on! Come on! (beeping continue) (whimpering) Oh! Oh, ah... Thank you. You're welcome. (exhales) Nicholas Brody. Richard Halstead, I'm... Secretary of Defense. Believe me, I know who you are. (sighs) What a f*ck up. (breathes heavily) Where's the vice president? Who knows? Where's the vice president?! He's all right. He's just right behind us. (phone rings) Berenson. It's me, Saul. Uh, I-I got to call you back. No! Carrie, we've got a situation. I-I-I know, I'm here. Saul, you have to listen to me. What do you mean, you're here? I saw the whole thing; The woman that was hit, Elizabeth Gaines, she is not the target. Vice president was the target. Walker missed. Walker would not have missed once, never mind three times! This is..his is just stage one. The real attack has not come yet. What real attack? What are you talking about? Following an assassination attempt, they'll sequester the high value targets, that's protocol. Right now, they're putting the vice president and his team out of sight, in a single, small space. They're supposed to be safe there, but they're not. They're vulnerable. How? Brody. Brody? For Christ's sake, Carrie, not this again. Forget about before; This is now. I saw him-- Brody. They hustled him right through the metal detectors along with the vice president. You even realize what you're saying? Yes! He's planning on taking them all out. That is what's coming! We've been hearing chatter for days now, Marine One, Marine Two. I-I-It's not the President's helicopter. It's actual marines-- Brody and Walker. They are Marine One and Marine Two. They're working together, they must be. Saul, you hear me? Yeah, I do. That's why Brody ratted me out, 'cause I was getting too close. God, it finally all makes sense. Yeah, sure. Saul, you got to get me in there. There's a CT Officer named Benton. I-I-I know him. I'll send him out for you. Thanks. Hurry. Yeah, bye. 
 
 There's a woman outside the building, one of ours. She's unstable, and you need to contain her. Her name's Carrie Mathison. Walden : I'm not getting stuck down here for a day and a half. Sanders : That won't happen, sir. Walden : I won't run and hide, you understand? Sanders : No one's asking that, just a little caution. Walden : Get your hands off me. Sanders : My apologies. Walden : f*ck your caution. One of my closest friends just got shot. All right, I understand. May I have your attention please. Sanders : We've initiated a full lockdown protocol for your protection. That means this door will now remain closed until one of two things happen. One, the sniper's apprehended, or, two, we establish to our satisfaction that he's left the vicinity, and it's safe to leave the room. Walden : And you believe this? You f*cking believe this? Sanders : You're safe, sir. That's the priority. Safe from what?! We look like a bunch of idiots. Well, you're my advisers. How about some advice? How about some f*cking advice? How do we spin this? Nazir :  There is nothing left to think about. Clench your teeth. Say the holy words. Remember Issa. Walden : Well? (click) (breathes heavily) (click, click) Halsted : I advise we wait, like the man said. There a men's room here? There better be. Sanders : This way. Where is he? There's no time. Virgil : Wait. Oh, there he is. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I said wait. Virgil : What's with all the backup? Damn you, Saul. Virgil, am I crazy? Look, you know you are. No, I mean about Brody. Just tell me if I am. (sighs) Virgil, I need to know! I don't know, okay? But I trust you. I need your keys. Where are you going? You don't want to know. All right, go. I'll run interference. Ben! Hey which one of you guys is Benton? Are you Benton? Which one of you is Benton? (panting) (engine starts) (panting) (low, indistinct conversations) (speaks indistinctly) (clears throat) Any word out there? No. Well, they said this could happen. You okay? You look a little peaked. Well, not a fan of being locked up, I guess. You've reenergized him, you know. Sir? Walden. He sees you as a living, breathing vindication of everything he's ever done. He's got big plans for you. Wouldn't you know it, no paper towels. Another f*ck up. (panting) (whispers): Oh, come on.  (panting) (music playing quietly) ... massive search for the sniper is now underway in the area between E Street (vehicle approaching) and Independence Avenue all the way from the Potomac to 17th... (knocking) I'm coming! No one is going in or out. Eyewitnesses say the vice president and his supporters... My God. (loud knocking) Oh, my God. Yeah? What? What are you doing here? You're Dana, right? Yeah. I'm Carrie Mathison. I know who you are. It's about your dad. Was he hit? No. I saw on the TV... No. I-I know. I was there. I saw it happen. He wasn't shot. But, Dana, I need your help. Can I come inside? (Carrie panting) You heard about Tom Walker? Yeah. How he was turned against us? Yeah. Did he shoot those people? Yes. Dana, listen to me. Your dad told me that you are the one who understands him, who he listens to. And this is very hard to say, but your dad is working with Tom Walker. They're working together. They are carrying out an attack right now. What are you talking about? He is with the vice president and other innocent people. He is going to kill them if we don't stop them. Okay, you have to call him and just talk him down. All right? This will get you to the Secret Service. That'll connect you. (soft gasp) We don't have much time. You can do this, Dana. (dialing) Okay. Hi. Um, I'm at 3319 Chapman, and it's... it's emergency. There's..here's an insane woman... No! No! Dana! Get out! Dana, please. Get back inside! Get out of my house! Dana, please, get back inside. Get out! Please! Dana : Get out of my house! Dana! You must have noticed. Leave me alone! Something strange, him acting off. No, you're off! Just call him and make sure. Something is wrong with you! God! Why are you even here?! I told you! So that we can stop him. Who's that with Dana? Stay in the car. Leave me alone. Mom... Mom... What's going on? She-she came here and she says that Dad is working with Tom Walker! Get in the house. Call the police, right now. I already did. Dana? Dana, please. Please call him. Get away from her! Jessica, listen... What are you doing telling some crazy story to my daughter? No, it's not crazy. (panting) He has intentions to kill the vice president and his staff. You have to believe me. It's not too late to stop him. Believe you? I told Dana she needs to call him... You f*cked my husband. And now you need to call him. He tells you to get lost, (siren wailing) and-and now you're..aking up all those crazy sh1t. No, you're not listening to me. Of course I'm not listening to you. Please, just call him. You really don't want this happening. Are we okay here? No, we're not okay. Okay, please. You don't understand what's going on, any of you! Ma'am... Okay, the world is about to end, and we're standing around talking! Ma'am, come with us. No! Get... get off of me! Come with us! Come on! Get off of me! Do not move! Stay down! Stay... stay there. (handcuffs clicking) (Jessica speaking indistinctly) (panting) (quietly): Ow! sh1t. (continues panting) (door opens) You okay in there? Yeah, fine. We found the shooter's weapon abandoned in an apartment a block away. It shouldn't be too much longer, we'll have you all out of there. Great. (toilet flushing) (panting) You sure you're okay? I'm feeling a little sick, actually. If you need a doctor or anything? No. No, thanks. That won't be necessary. (chuckles) (low, indistinct conversations) (panting quietly) Sergeant Brody. I got a call for you, from your daughter. She says it's an emergency. Dana? (crying): Dad... where are you? Dana, I got to call you back. No, Dad, no. There was... there was this crazy woman at our house, the one that... that, you know, you were with, and... she was saying all these things about you, and I just... I had to hear your voice. Dad? (panting) (sniffles) Dad? Yeah. Yeah, but, Dana, I... Dad, she said that you were working with Tom Walker, that-that you're a terrorist. I'm not. I know, Dad, I know. Of course you're not. I-I wouldn't have believed her, because you would never do anything like that, ever. Ever. I didn't believe her at all. Dana, I'm here with a group of people. Look, I've got to go. No, Dad, don't. We're just, uh, we're in a holding area, and, um, you know, they're about to let us out. So you're coming home? Sure. Tell me that. (panting): Yeah, I'm coming home. No, Dad, don't say it like that. Dad..romise me. You have to promise me that you're coming home, Dad. (sniffles) Dad? (inhales) Dad, you have to promise me. I need you. You know that. (crying quietly) I'm coming home, Dana. I promise. (exhale) Okay. Thank you. Sanders : Copy. All right, we're clear. We're clear. Nick..ou look like sh1t. Come on. What a f*ckin' day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family..s does this pledge: Her murder will not go unpunished. For this reason... I stand before you today to officially announce my intention to run for President of the United States, and to rededicate myself and this nation... Jessica : Yes, of course. Yes. Anytime. That was the police. They want to know if we want to press charges. Walden : ...fear. Brody, are you listening to me? What did you tell them? That I would talk to you. I'll take care of it. This woman is sick. There's something seriously wrong with this woman. So whatever you decide... I don't want to ever hear her name in this house again. I said I'll take care of it! (Walden continues) Good. I'm gonna go see if Dana's doing better. (applause over TV) Saul. Mr. Vice President. Give us, uh, five minutes? Let's make it ten, be on the safe side. Ten. How's Mira? Oh, great. Thanks. No doubt you and David Estes are broadly huddled about this mess? What are you playing at, Saul? I call it f*ck the terrorists. I remember where you are. I know exactly where I am, sir. Are we on the same side? Because your tone suggests otherwise. Trying to find out about what happened yesterday, why. Trying to stop it from happening again. And you think this redacted file will help you to do that? I can't let anyone see that until I see what's under all those black lines. Trust me Saul, this is nothing but a turd let it lie. You're my boss for 3 and a half years, did I ever once let anything lie? I'm saying this would be a good time to start. I don't agree. Here's another thing you might remember about me, I'm a sentimentalist, I like to hold on to things. For old time sake. If I ever told the american people these interrogation tapes had been destroyed I was mistaken. Coercion, cruelty, all right, torture. Makes for a very unhappy viewing. You gave the orders William, I gave the orders. You're blackmailing me. You'll stay with us. The girls have fixed up the room for you, They'll have you on the flowers. They are very excited. Thank you, Maggie. I told them that you need to rest but not, you know, why exactly. Carrie? Did you know he was here? Carrie, what are you doing? There are criminal charges pending, you shouldn't talk to him. I have to. Brody, I am... You broke into my house. You terrified my daughter. She's 16 years old, by the way, sixteen. I'm sorry. They asked me what I wanted to do about it, the police did. What did you tell them? Nothing yet. That'll depend on you. For the last time, Carrie, I am not what you think I am. I'm sorry. You keep saying that, it is not enough. I know about your condition, David Estes told me. Carrie, you need to get some help. I am. And you need to stay away from me. And from my family. You set up surveillance, you watched me, you pushed your way into my life, - and for what? Okay. Fun? It's crazy what you did. You understand... I said okay. What does that mean? I understand. I'll stay away from you, you have my word. Goodbye Brody. Goodbye Carrie. Home now? To the hospital. Oh, f*ck. It's Abu Nazir in the target area. We believe... You sure wanna see this? What you've been hiding from me? Yeah, I do. 80% certain he was here. A ground assault is preferable in terms of collateral damage. But impossible in the time frame. That's a school, sir. Don't cloud the issue. If Abu Nazir is taking refuge among children he is putting them at risk, not us. So, we agree? Good to go. It's our joint opinion the potential collateral damage falls within current *matrix* parameters. And, uh... Someone actually came up with that language. That was 2 years ago, you reported to me at that time and you said nothing. Because you would have stopped it. Yeah, none of this would have happened. No dead children, no cover up, no Carrie Mathison drawn out of the agency... Keep her out of this. You know what I think, when she got a lead on Nazir, first one in over seven years, wasn't it worth mentioning this strong string? Even in private to me. Or is your career on the coat tails of the vice president? Trump national security. Really, I'm fascinated to know. The world changed, Saul. Right under your nose. Answer the damn question. I am. We're about projecting American power now, degrading Al-Qaeda militarily. You wanna play soft ball spy games, go join the germans or the french. I am this f*cking close to picking up the phone, and calling the New York Times. No, you're not. You know why? Because telling the world we killed 82 kids on purpose, would endanger every one of your case officers in the field. Not to mention every American soldier on the ground. You would, essentially, be handling the enemy the biggest recruitment tool since Abu Ghraib. I gotta say I am impressed. You've got the balls to show up. I'm impressed you're alive. Care to explain? We all went to the same place, Nick, I just got out of there a lot quicker. Now, you wanna tell me what happened yesterday? I don't answer to you, Tom! And I didn't come in here to make excuses. What the f*ck happened? I came here because you got a direct line to Nazir. f*ck Nazir! My vest malfunctioned, okay? Bullshit! You f*cking panicked! Tom? Maybe what happened yesterday was a good thing. What if I had detonated that vest? What would be different? Ask yourself that. Today, they would've just replaced Walden with somebody else. So the f*ck what? So, that means I'm close to the next president of the United States, Tom. That puts me in a unique position. Nazir? You listened to this garbage, Nazir? I'm listening. What do you want me to do? Put Nicholas on the phone. Nazir? Is it true what you say? Yes, I hit the switch but nothing happened. I meant about the vice-president. Yes, it's true. At the very least, I'd be able to influence policy at the highest levels. Why kill a man when you can kill an idea? That's what I'm thinking. Nazir, are you still there? I want to believe what you say, but to help me believe I need a demonstration of your commitment. Name it. You did it once or at least you were told you did, uh? There is a wild card in this new play. You understand what I'm saying? Nicholas? Yeah, I understand. Then say goodbye. Tell Walker I need to speak to him privately. (arab speaking) Wants to talk to you. It's done. (arab speaking) (arab speaking) You got a million calls while you were out. Presidency office and vice president's office, too. You okay? Yeah, better. And, Jess, I'm sorry that I shouted at you before. It's okay. I'm surprised you're keeping it together at all. Thank you. For what? Everything. Excuse me, sir? Excuse me, sir! I'm sorry sir, this is locked ward. I've got my pass here somewhere. Here, for preop. It's across the hall on the right. What did you say? Thank you. On the right, second door. Just a little sting. How are you feeling, honey? Fine. Take that thing out of her arm. Saul. - Sir... Out of my way. This is f*cking barbaric. I won't allow it. Jim! I'm getting you out of here. Saul, stop. Just listen to me. This was... I wanna do this thing. What? - It was my decision, I told them to go ahead. Your decision? Have a shock treatment? It's not Cuckoo's nest, Saul. They use ultra brief impulses now. It's called electrocomplusive therapy. I don't care what is called. They still attached electrodes to your skull, don't they? Still jilting into a seizure? I need to do something. I can't take this anymore. Yes, you can. You're the strongest person I know. So pass. No, it won't pass. It's only getting worse... Carrie, please, there's alternatives to this. You don't have to let them f*ck with your brain. My brain's already f*cked. Yeah? It is a brain I happen to love. Is everything okay, Ms. Mathison? Everything's fine, thanks, yes, really. You sure? What about the side effects? Memory loss... That is only short time. It's usually temporary. A lot what's happened lately I kinda like to forget anyway. That's not even remotely funny. Saul, I made up my mind. I'm grateful for the concern but I just... I can't live like this any more. It needs to stop. Yeah. Well... You shouldn't feel all bad. I mean... It hasn't been an unmitigated disaster. You were wrong about Brody. And you were right about Nazir. You're telling me the yellow, his period of dormancy? Yes. He was in mourning. His son died in a drone strike in northern Iraq. Which son? Youngest, 10 years old. Along with 82 of his Madrasi classmates. Apparently the vice president gave the order. How on Earth did I miss that? You didn't. Record's been wiped white clean. Expunged. Like it never happened. Wow. Thanks for telling me. You deserved to know. So, Saul, is there any change that I can appeal on my termination? No. Dad! What you're doing up here? Came up to fix the leak in the skylight. Is it beer? That came later. Never knew it had views. The Shore's back yard, nice. Do you mind if I join you? No, of course not. You're ready? This is the anesthetic I was telling you about. I want you to start counting backwards from 100. 100... 99... 98... 97... 96... 95... Issa. Issa, no! Issa... Issa... Issa... Issa, Nazir's son Brody knew him. Saul, don't let me f*cking forget... What did she say? Nothing, it's the anesthetic, everyone does it. She's asleep. OK, we're ready. Paddles on...
