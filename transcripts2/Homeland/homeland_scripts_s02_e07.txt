 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan :  This relentless pursuit of terror. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... 
 Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. 
 This was an act of terrorism. 
 It was a despicable and cowardly act. 
 The next samba we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. 
 ...until something stops him. 
 Carrie :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. 
 Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. 
 Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? Carrie :  f*ck! I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Saul :  Previously on  Homeland... Dana :  We hit someone with your car. She died in the middle of the night. We have to tell someone. No, we don't. We agreed to stay quiet. It's even more important now. Saul : I got a line on our terrorist. I can get her to talk. Saul : Hi, Aileen. Who are you? Your ride. (panting) (sighs) What is the target? I don't know. (screaming) CARRIE: What the f*ck is the matter with you? This is my interrogation! Saul : Get him out of here. Carrie :  I can do this, Saul. It's my turn. What is Abu Nazir's plan? I don't know. But there is a plan? Yes. Who does know the plan? I'm a friend of Nazir's. Carrie :  This is it. This is the meet we've been waiting for. Galvez : That's him. Without the sunglasses. Brody : The tailor in Gettysburg, he's dead. He handled their munitions. If this new guy turns out to be his replacement, we need a line on him fast. I'll put a forensics team together and take them to Gettysburg. (automatic gunfire) (panting) You heard about Gettysburg? Heard about it? It's all over the f*cking news. Brody : Was that really necessary? Roya : We got what we needed, that's the important thing. Which was what? But we lost a man, so you're going to have to play a larger role now. Yeah, like what? How about some details? Not possible. (panting) That's not good enough, Roya. That's how it's always been. What's different now? Six federal agents are dead. You can't expect business as usual. It is what it is, and things are going to move very quickly now. Oh, like a day? A week? I need you to meet with someone. Brody : Who? Roya : I'll let you know the how and where as soon as I can. I got to tell you, Roya, I don't like this. You don't have to like it, but this is no time to buck. We're almost there. Meanwhile, this weekend, you're at a Walden fund-raiser, right? Yeah. Keep him happy. I always do. Keep him very happy. Guard :  This one's a piece of work. A spitter, a hitter and a shitter. That doesn't sound like her. Then you don't know her too well. BA54, open please. (buzzer sounds) (lock clicks) Aileen? It's Saul Berenson. We drove from Mexico to D.C. together. I said I might be back if I needed help. Can we talk about this upstairs? What's wrong with here? Everything. It's very urgent. (door opens) (door closes) You ever get outside? 23 hours in the cell. One hour to walk around, go to the crappy library, that kind of thing. Yeah. My eyes are shot, though. I don't even read anymore. Look at that light. Isn't it nice? I need help, Aileen. We're on a tight timetable. You said. You know who this is? Yeah, I know him. Who is he? Name, address, anything. I tell you, you get what you need, and I get shoved back into that cell. Well, maybe I can talk to the warden. He's sadistic. Oh, they say that about every warden. For a reason. Time is of the essence here. Not for me. Okay. What do you want? Keeping in mind there's only so much I can do for a confessed terrorist. A window. A cell with a view. I can get that. How do you know? Can you trust me that I can get that for you and help me now? I don't trust anyone. Okay. I'll be back. On the gate. (lock clicks) Quinn : Why does Roya care so much about Walden? Maybe he's the target. Again? Well, the World Trade Center was hit in '93 and was the target again more recently, you may recall. (exhales) You see Galvez? Yeah. It doesn't look good. Oh, sh1t. They told his parents to come. You get any word back from the lab? The good news is there were no radioactive contaminants in the shop. So it's not a dirty bomb. But judging from the RDX residue and the fact that it took two guys to move that thing, they've got enough C-4 to level an embassy, a synagogue. And they're in the wind. Yeah. I got to get out of this dress. They're not discharging you. I'm discharging me. (groans) Where's Saul? He went to the supermax in Waynesburg to see Aileen. That's our big move? Rattle a chick who's been locked up for months? (sighs) It's a Hail Mary. Quinn, right in front of me? Like you've never seen a dick before. Chris : You gonna ride a horse? I don't know. 'Cause you could break your neck on a horse. (sniffs) Finn? I went to her funeral. They passed around this collection plate, and there were like, $12. You want to send money or something? I want to tell. Tell who? Our parents, the cops. And, uh, what will that achieve? It's the right thing to do. I know. I'm not a sociopath here, okay? Then let's do it together. If we were normal people with normal parents, we would. But what? We're special? My dad... What? It's bad enough with him. I'm sorry, but if you're not gonna do this with me, I have to do it by myself. Okay. Okay what? Okay, we'll tell. (exhales) Will Senator Laughton be there? Laughton's fading. Avery Phillips is the new contender. A woman, interesting. (grunts) Yeah, Walden's playing the field. You're still the front-runner. Yeah. So Mike was over the other night. Who told you that? Chris. He told me something upsetting. About you. Why am I not surprised? He told me you killed Tom. You believe him? I can take it if it's the truth, but I can't take another lie. The CIA knew we were close, and they used me to reach him, and then it got messy. Like how? Like dangerous. Yeah, I... I did have a part in..n stopping him. What the f*ck, Brody? I know. I know. But look, Tom lost his way. He just..e just went through too many things, and he-he couldn't get right again. It looks like we're here. It's about time you visited, Billy. You been busy or something? Just waiting for an invitation, Rex. My door's always open; you know that. Ah, Cynthia. Hi there, Rex. You still look like a Tri Delt. Okay, that's enough. (laughter) So..hen? Let's do it later. Today though. Yeah, yeah. Sometime today. Nick Brody, Rex Henning, owner of this little dacha. Pleasure. It's beautiful. Oh, thank you very much. Bar fight? Home improvements. (chuckles) This is my wife, Jessica. Jessica, welcome. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Thank you. Nick, I've been looking forward to meeting you. Thank you. Let's get inside and have some lemonade. Raise some money. (Henning speaks indistinctly) I'll meet you inside. (phone rings) Hi, Brody. How does my wife know about Tom Walker? Uh, I don't know. I'll tell you how. Mike Faber, and how the f*ck does he know? You tell me. Hey, Brody, calm down. You came to me, accusing me of lying about Gettysburg. Maybe it's you who's the one that's lying, hmm? Pulling some bullshit on me. I'm not. Why should I believe you? I'll take care of Faber. How? How? Have you really got this under control? Because it doesn't seem like it. And what the f*ck happened in that shop? How did you lose those six agents? We're investigating that. Great, so you're hedging, Roya's hedging. This thing is on, I'm at the center of it, and I'm in the f*cking dark. Brody, we'll deal with Faber, I promise. I know this is hard. I'm sor... (beeps) Are you my chaperone for the weekend? Well, somebody's got to do it. Oh, well, this should be fun. f*ck. He's stressed. Well, he's a friggin' double agent, no sh1t he's stressed. I thought Saul and Estes already wrangled Faber. Well, I guess it didn't take. Go to Brody after. (sighs) You think? He's our only play here. He's everything. He's still with us, but he needs to feel a sense of control, power. So empower the guy. (door closes) I know it's unusual, Warden, but she's a CIA asset, and it's urgent. My. I can, of course, go through the formal channels, but if you could expedite this, it's truly a matter of national security. I know that you're a very important man. It has nothing to do with me. With agendas and access I can only wonder about. I'm asking as a fellow law enforcement agent. Can you move Aileen Morgan above ground? We all have our issues. Homeland Security funding goes to the big cities. My budget gets cut. I sympathize. And we all have our domains, don't we? And the United States Penitentiary Waynesburg is mine. Understood. And in this domain, a big shot from the big city with his fine credentials and heaven-may-care grooming... Excuse me? ...just doesn't have the kind of power he's accustomed to. I'll have orders sent from the attorney general. Mike Faber. Carrie Mathison. Right. Thanks for meeting me. You're welcome to come up. Yeah, I spend all day inside. I thought we could get some fresh air. So what's this about? Well, it's about giving you the lay of the land. Regarding? - Which I really shouldn't have to do since my colleagues already told you to stand down. Ah. Brody. There is a terrorist event on the horizon. Nick Brody is essential to our plan for stopping it. So if we weren't clear enough the first time, let me drive it home again. Cease and f*cking desist, understood? A terrorist attack. Yes. They didn't say that at Langley. Well, they shouldn't have had to. You should have complied. But you're emotional about Brody. No, ma'am. Because you're in love with his wife. Excuse me? We know about you and Jessica. There's nothing to know. You were with her. You were going to move in, but then he came home. That was a long time ago. Not really. Not when you've chosen someone. Look, Mike, it's..t's hard wanting something, or someone, that you just can't have. You don't know what I want. Stop talking to her about Brody. Stop playing detective. It won't help her. What will help then? You standing by, looking out for her. Because some time soon she and those kids might really need you. All right, I'll... I'll lay off then. I hope you get what you want. How long did they hold you? About eight years. They didn't just hold him, Buttercup, they broke his bones. Oh. That's crazy. Yes, it was. What else did they do? So, uh, how old is your boy, Congressman? He's almost 12 now. Did you ever just want to kill yourself? You have some dark moments. Chris : Hey, Dad, you gonna swim? Sure. Excuse me. What's the water like? It's nice. Hey, Chris, we'll swim later. Okay. It's nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. So... Gettysburg, what happened? We lost a battle, sir. Why did you go in? There was no movement for days. We made a judgment call. And a poor one. In retrospect. People are not feeling safe, David. I understand, sir. I'm not feeling safe. We can't have these lunatics on the loose with their goddamned explosives. Obviously. Another attack on our watch. We're on it, sir. Believe me. Well, I certainly hope so. (door opens) You were right. The warden's a b*st*rd. So is that it? No, we'll go over his head. Oh, good. But in the meantime... What? There's some very bad people out there. No way. I need to know who this is. Don't you do that. Don't you try to trick me! No one's tricking you. I'm not telling you sh1t! Not till I get a window permanently, and I see it on a legal f*cking document. Aileen. I'm not getting f*cked over on this! No, you're not. You have my word. (sighs) (sighs heavily) (sighs) Sorry. I want to trust you. Then you should. I'm sorry I've become this person. But I have. I never knew one of these horses from another till my wife passed. I always meant to sell them all off, but... Well, this one's a beauty. That's Amelia, was her favorite. She fractured her femur, which usually means a trip to the field with a gun, but... You rehabbed her? We harnessed her into a horse swimming pool for therapy, all kinds of crazy stuff. Listen, I'm sorry about the lookie-loos at the pool. It's bad enough we went to hell and back. People want to ogle the damage. Oh, you served? I was in the navy in Vietnam, UDT 21. Mekong Delta, '69. I didn't think I'd make it through the second tour. Yeah, it can do that to you. Coming home was a bitch though. It took a while, but I got myself back. Right. Like you. It didn't break you. Just don't call me a hero. (chuckles) They do that, don't they? As if there's some glory in it. Yeah, I was captured and shoved in a hole. All I did was not die. People need it, though, Nick. They need you on a poster, waving in a parade. I don't care much for Walden. Oh, that's a surprise. He's a hawk, but he's ignorant. He hasn't seen war. No. And there's trouble ahead, Nick. I mean, Iran, Israel, this slaughter up in Gettysburg. Something's coming. I think you're right. Mm-hmm. But the bottom line is I'm supporting Walden because I'm looking eight years down the road at you. No, Mr. Henning. Rex. You give me too much credit. (chuckles) You're a soldier, and you're very humble, Nick. Well, you're very kind. And you'll be right at Walden's hip while he's president. Hopefully, you can help him be wise. All right, Rex, honestly, the truth... I'm not that man. I know you don't feel that way. No, no, really, I'm not. I'll see you tonight. 
 
 (phone rings) Hello? Carrie : Take the trail behind the stables. Why? Go through the pasture, then walk up the path through the trees. Oh, yeah, what will I find there? Me. I'm in the clearing. Hi. Faber's gonna leave it alone. Good. So, Roya's pulling you into something, huh? I don't want to think about it. Is that why you're upset? Who says I'm upset? I was just having a long conversation with the guy who owns this place. He was a soldier. He was a real soldier. Served in Vietnam, saw all the sh1t you see, didn't lose himself. The worst part of it is... ...he believes I'm like him. That guy, he's the man I could have been..f I hadn't... No, it doesn't always work out the way we want. Hey, is this for real? I don't know. Are you just handling me? You know, keeping me close? Brody, I don't know, and I don't... I don't want you to feel used. (sighs) You know what? I do feel used, and played, and lied to, but I also feel good. (chuckles) Two minutes with you, and I feel good. How do you pull that off? (exhales) (sighs) (indistinct chatter) What are you doing? Liquid courage. Finn, let's just do this thing. All right, just..et me pick my moment. No, I'll pick it. Now. Yeah, right in front of all my mom's friends? There's never gonna be a good time; we just have to suck it up. You don't know what you're talking about. You're new to this world. If "this world" means lying, and being a coward then I don't want any part in it. Jessica : Dana. What is the squabble about? It's nothing. Bullshit nothing! Jessica : Hey, stop cursing. This is not okay. We killed someone. Jesus. What? Hit-and-run a week ago. All right, let's take this inside. Inside. It was at Woodley Road; she was just crossing the street... Jessica : Jesus, Dana. I know. How could you just drive away? We were scared. That's no excuse! I know! Okay, Mom, I know. You should have come to us. Well, we're here now. Finn, you've been drinking. No, I haven't. You've been drinking, and now have to leave. Go get your things. Dana, go to the room. Wait for me there. (sighs) I can't believe this. It's awful. We have to deal with it head-on. We'll report it, get lawyers. We have to remember, we're on the world stage here. Of course. These things..ave to be dealt with in a..n a certain way. Well, yeah, but... I know what to do. Leave it to me; we'll be fine. What does that mean? That means that I'll take care of it. How? You're gonna have to follow my lead here. I don't know, Cynthia. I need to talk to Brody. I'm waiting on the attorney general to call back. Quinn : What's the hold up? His daughter's school play. Oh, f*ck me. We ready to jump when I get a name? I got SWAT waiting, I got the mute here to drive me. You're going? With that gut wound? I'm fine. All right. I'll call you. I'm not mute. Contraband. Nice. Bread, cheese, wine. "From the vineyards of San Juan, Argentina, (laughing): with unique character." Not bad for easy-top wine, right? You're nice. To your window. I think about that road trip sometimes. It was sort of fun, right? (laughs softly) Under the circumstances. (laughs) You were having trouble with your wife. Mira. Yes, I was. How is she? She is, um..n Mumbai. And you're not. That's about the size of it. Sorry. I moved to Lebanon shortly after. Maybe on some level to be closer to her. That's still pretty far from India. It didn't really do the trick. (chuckles) (phone ringing) Hi, Robert. Intermission? Yes. Great. I owe you. Thanks. It's done. A window? They faxed over a signed order. Should be arriving any minute. Your turn. (sighs) I have to see it first. (door opens) (door closes) Here. Thanks. (sighs) Mohammed Al Ghamdi. He's been in the States about a year. Where can we find him? Last I knew he was in Newark, somewhere near Military Park. Okay. He's gun crazy. If he sees you coming... Got it. On the gate. (door opens) She stays in this room till I'm back. (crickets chirping) ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Why does this kid always get in trouble? You gave him the car. This was a week ago? Why doesn't he talk to us? Why? Because he's scared of you. That's ridiculous. No, it's not. I don't think he ever planned to tell us. It was Dana who pushed it. We got to manage this. I talked to David Estes. He and the campaign guys will deal with D.C. Metro. Does Brody know? - I think it's his wife we need to worry about. Because? She talked about police, lawyers. She needs to not talk at all. Which I relayed. Hey. Hey. What's up? You know how Dana's been locked in her room not saying more than two words at a time? Yeah. If she did something terrible, something criminal, we would go to the police, right? What did she do? We wouldn't just gloss over her doing something really, really bad, just because we're in politics, right? Because Cynthia thinks... Cynthia? What? Slow down. Tell me what's happened. Finn. Finn. I'm sorry if you're in trouble. It doesn't matter. Yeah, it matters. I'm not a coward. It's just... I know how this goes. My parents are different than yours. Man, this is why I liked you so much. 'Cause you don't know how it goes... yet. Well, how can you just accept that? What else can I do? I don't... I don't know, Finn, but I just don't get how you live like that. So you don't get me. We're gonna report it, my parents and I. Yeah. Good luck with that. Finn. Bye, Dana. (engine starting) Ah, there he is. Brody, your new pal's looking for you. Henning : A moment, everyone. First off, welcome, and thank you for your presence. The price tag was not for the faint of heart. (laughter) Today I had a chance to talk with Nick Brody. Now, we all know his story and what he has withstood to be here today. And a betting man might say he is the likely vice presidential candidate. You've decided that, have you? (laughter) I am supporting Bill Walden for president. Phew. That's why you're all standing in my study. But the quiet surprise here is Nick Brody. Although he is not an officer, he is, in fact, a gentleman. And I personally feel that a Walden-Brody ticket would make the future truly bright. Cheers. All : Cheers. Walden : Excuse me, fellas. Cigar? No, thanks. What are we gonna do about Dana and Finn? We're on it, but you should talk to your wife. Oh, we've talked. This will all be taken care of if we all just stick with the program. What does "stick with the program" mean? Just let it lie. We'll clean it up. Are you saying it's okay that our two kids just ran someone over in the streets? No, it's not okay, but we should not be benched because of it. We're about to run for office, the highest office in the world. It's a moving train. And a screw up by a couple of teenagers isn't getting in our way, understood? Quinn :  31 Sussex Avenue,  north side of the street, freestanding, one story. Covered foot access from the front, seal the rear with mobile units. Man  (over radio): Copy that. Suspect's name is Mohammed Al Ghamdi. Six foot, 180 pounds, assumed threat level four. (grunts) Your location... eight minutes. Wait, out. (over radio): Eight minutes. Roger, out. (vehicles approaching) (tires squealing) Federal agents! On the ground! Federal agents! Don't move! (agents yelling indistinctly) All clear. We got one in custody. (speaking Arabic) What is this? Well, this ain't the guy. What guy?! What's your name? Mohammed Al Ghamdi. The musician. You know, like..ike Coldplay? Quinn  (over phone):  His dad was head of security  for Aileen's family in Saudi Arabia. He knew Aileen from the pool club. Pool club? Yeah, he's some kind of music grad student now. Half an idiot. So she duped us. Whole thing was bullshit. She probably doesn't even know our guy. Why would she do that? Maybe she was bored. Got her jollies dicking you around. She knew we'd find out. What did it buy her? Aileen! Aileen! (pounding) Aileen! Open the f*cking door! (door opens) Aileen. Oh. (panting) You missed the sunset. No. Why did you do this? I'm not going back. What? I'm never going back to that cave. Guards! No, don't call them. Please don't, Saul. (crying): Jesus. Why would you do this? I just spent the day by the window. A whole day. Light, sun, a view... Best last day I could have. Jesus Christ. Hi. Let's go. Where? Metro Police. Mom will take Chris home. I'm so relieved. Come on. And scared. I know, but I'll be with you. (dialing) (line ringing) Hi, David. Brody's leaving. What? He just went AWOL with his daughter. Where's he going? I think he's about to blow this thing. How? Get in the car and call me; I'll explain. (sighs) (beeping) (groans) That was tough luck. I got emotional. I wanted to believe her. Well, they do that to us sometimes-- get under our skin. It was sloppy. And I know better. Any word on Galvez? Well, he's still dying. You're a real diplomat. (scoffs) He was good in the shop. I hope you don't lose him. Yeah. We've had enough losing lately. Why is she here? I have no idea. Will you stay in the car? Hi. I have my daughter here. I see that. I'm sorry. What's going on? You can't do this, go to the police. Are you telling me you knew about this accident? No. I just found out, too. This is a private matter. It's not, actually, because if you report this, you'll alienate Walden, and Roya and Nazir want you near him, for whatever reason. I don't give a f*ck! This is my daughter. Brody, you won't have a deal anymore if you do this. (car door closes) The whole thing will be off. Do you understand? And that's for your daughter, too, right? What is this? Hi, Dana, I'm Carrie. Yeah, I remember. What are you doing here? Dana, we're not going to be able to do this right now, okay? Why not? Because she said so? It's really complicated, Dana. No, actually, it's really obvious. The campaign, the election. What could be more important? We'll do this down the line. I promise. You're bullshit. Dana. No, Dad, you just... You really make me sick. Hey, Dana. Dana! Dana! Your phone was off. This is f*cked up. I'm really sorry. It's not okay. Brody... This is not okay! None of this is f*cking okay! Dana!
