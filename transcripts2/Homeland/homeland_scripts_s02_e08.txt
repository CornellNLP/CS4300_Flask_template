 President Reagan :  Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities... 
 Reporter :  Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie. 
 Reagan :  He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait. 
 Reagan :  This relentless pursuit of terror. 
 President George H.W. Bush :  We will make no distinction... 
 Reporter :  The USS  Cole  was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden. 
 This was an act of terrorism. 
 It was a despicable and cowardly act. 
 The next samba we're going to swing for you  is one of the good old favorites. 
 ...until something stops him. 
 Carrie :  I'm just making sure we don't get hit again. 
 Man :  That plane crashed into the World Trade Center. 
 Thousands of people running. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. (speaking Arabic) Saul :  What the f*ck are you doing? f*ck! Carrie :  I missed something once before. I won't... I let that happen again. Saul :  It was ten years ago. Everyone missed something that day. Carrie :  Everyone's not me. Previously on Who are they clearing the street for? Abu f*cking Nazir, God willing. Estes :  Holy sh1t, it's him. (gunfire) What about Abu Nazir? He got away. We just took a hit. We lost two in Beirut. Your role is more important than ever now. So Roya's pulling you into something, huh? I don't want to think about it. Do I know you? Some idiots hit her in a car, then took off. I want to tell. Tell who? Our parents, the cops. We killed someone. Jesus! What? Hit-and-run, a week ago. I'll take care of it. If she did something terrible, something criminal, we would go to the police, right? What did she do? We wouldn't just gloss over her doing something really, really bad just because we're in politics, right? Why is she here? I have my daughter here. I see that. I'm sorry. What's going on? You can't do this, go to the police. This is a private matter. It's not, actually. Brody, you won't have a deal anymore if you do this. What is this? We'll do this down the line. No, Dad. You just..ou really make me sick. Hey, Dana... Dana! None of this is f*cking okay! (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) Hey. Hey. It's just me. Oh. Look, if I'm interrupting something, I... No, no. I'm just surprised you're here. Me, too, I guess. Okay. Well, come on in. Thanks. She'll be okay. Are you sure about that? She's 16 years old. It's not like there's a five-year-old out there wandering the streets. That's not the point! She ran someone over! I know! And she's trying desperately to do the right thing! And you think I'm not? I don't know what the hell you're doing, Brody, I really don't. We told her we would go to the police and report this. I tried. And when you didn't go through with it, what was she supposed to think? I told her we'd handle it later. Well, we told her we would handle it now! (sighs) We are supposed to be her examples of what's right and wrong. We can't report it today, I told you! Right, national security. You know, you invoke that more than the president. Brody  (over speakers):  I'm doing everything I can. He's got a meeting with Roya Hammad in half an hour. Yeah. He's basically already late. Yeah, from the sounds of it, he's not gonna be out of there any time soon. He's got to be; he can't mess this up. Brody : You act as if I have a choice in this! I don't! Of course you do. So tell me what to do. Tell me! You don't know. You tell the CIA to back off! I mean, you tell them your daughter matters more! I can't, I can't, I can't! Give me their number, I'll do it. (phone ringing) Hello? Oh, thank God. Tell her I'll be right there. She's at Mike's. I'll go get her. Don't. Chris, come on. We need to get your sister. (cell phone buzzing) Brody  (recorded): Hey, this is Nicholas Brody. Please leave a message. (beep) I gotta go in there. You want some help? No, stay here. Brody? Brody. Roya's expecting you. You're already late. Brody, you need to go. No more. I can't. You have to. She said she's taking you to meet a new contact. This is it; it's happening now. Brody, remember why you're doing this. What, our deal? Your family. My family? You were listening out there. You heard. Everything's falling apart. This is a nightmare. It's almost over. Come on. Come on. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry about this. No trouble. But she fell asleep upstairs. We were watching TV and she crashed. Want a water? No. What did she say? Just that she needed to get away. That's all? Yeah. I mean, obviously, something's going on, though. I'm surprised she even showed up here. I'm not. She spent a lot of time here when Brody was gone. Mike, she was involved in a hit-and-run. What? Someone else was driving, and she's trying to make it right, but, well, it's gotten very, very complicated. It's tearing her up. And, please, you can't tell her I said anything. Okay. Promise me. Yeah. Is there anything I can do to help though? Just let her sleep, if that's okay. I gotta go. Chris is waiting in the car. I'll have her call you when she wakes up. Thanks. (whispers): Jesus Christ. (sighs) (door closes) Virgil : He look okay to you? Better than he did at the house. He's under a lot of pressure. Well, it shows. We're lucky she waited. You're late. I know. You want to tell me why? Not really. Roya : I nearly left. Brody : Yeah? I nearly didn't come at all. Sir, you hearing this? Yeah. Roya : You want to tell me what's going on with you? What the hell is he doing? Brody! What? What's going on? You know what's going on. I'm being asked to be part of an attack. on this country... Okay. That's enough. ...without knowing where or what or..r why, being told "he" needs me or "they" need me, and who the f*ck are "they" anyway?! That's what's going on with me. How about you, huh? Everything good, I hope? Look, I know it's been difficult lately. It's been impossible. And for what? I'm through. What the f*ck? Carrie's on site there, right? Get her on the line. Mm-hmm. I understand you're feeling confused. You don't have a clue what I'm feeling. Brody, quitting is not an option. You think whatever you're threatening can make my life any more f*cked up than it is now? I'm not threatening. Sure you are. Come back, sit down and talk to me. There's nothing more to say. (cell phone ringing) What the hell was that? f*ck! f*ck! sh1t. It's Quinn. He's gonna want to shut us down. Oh, you think? Virgil, you have to kill the tracking on Brody's phone. Why? Just do it. If Quinn asks, tell him it failed. He won't believe that for a second. Well, make him. What are you doing? I've got to keep this thing going. Keep what going? Brody just blew it up. The whole operation's dead. No, it's not. His cover's still intact. As long as his cover isn't blown, he's still in play. Kill the tracking. (cell phone ringing) (sighs) Yeah. What the f*ck, Carrie? Answer your goddamn phone. Uh, we were having tech problems. We lost tracking on Brody. Yeah, here, too. He must have dumped his phone. I'm on foot now. Where? Looking for him. Listen to me, Carrie-- I want you to bring him in. Right. I mean now. He's out of control. I want him off the streets. So do I. Off the streets here, in front of me. He's a danger to all of us. Tell me you hear me. I hear you. If we do not pick him up, they will, and who knows what he'll say. This thing is over. Carrie? I'll tell you if I find him. Hey, find out what happened to that phone. - Okay. Brody, give me the keys. They'll have backup here in three minutes. I'm trying to keep you from spending the rest of your life in a cage. Do you think I really care what happens to me anymore? Well, I do. I care what happens to you, even if you don't. Please. Give me the keys. (engine starts) Your protégé. She's really outdone herself this time. Have a seat. I'll stand. Brody jumped surveillance. I heard. Carrie made it happen. You sure? The two of them are missing, Carrie's not answering her phone-- yeah, Saul I'm pretty f*cking sure! She took a confessed terrorist off the grid. I went out on a limb to support you on this. I even kept Walden out of the loop, so that we could run Brody back against Nazir. Now Brody's unraveling. Ever occur to you Carrie's trying to fix that? Well, she's got a twisted thing for the guy. Who knows what her motivations are? Well, she's trying to repair the situation. I can't bank on that. There's an attack planned, Saul, possibly imminent. And I don't want to be the one standing in front of the Senate explaining who Carrie was f*cking when the bomb went off. You burned your cover in Beirut to float this operation, which, as of 20 minutes ago, is officially sh1t. I'm the only friend you've got left in the building. So if you have any idea where Carrie is, you damn well better say. I'm not playing games here, Saul. Get up from that chair, find her and bring her back. With Brody. It's room number five, over there. I really don't know what I'm doing here. But if that's the last thing I see before they lock me up, I could do worse. Here. You think you can save this..ou can't. I'll get us some food. They'll be looking for us, and someone might recognize you. (sighs) I promised your mother that you would call her. I will. As soon as you woke up. Come on, you're making me look bad. Can I stay here? Tonight, I mean. Would that be okay with you? Call your mom and ask. Go on. Okay. (phone ringing) Hello. Hey. Hey. Mike said that you were having dinner over there. Yeah. Um, can I stay over? Well, did he say it was okay? He said ask you. Well, it's fine with me. Just, um... What? I miss you. Mom... ...is Dad there? No. Where is he? Um, I'm not sure. He tell you why he backed out at the police station? No, not really. It was that woman from the CIA. Carrie. She just showed up and said something to him, and suddenly it was all off. Mom? I didn't know. I'm sorry. I didn't say it to hurt you. I know, sweetheart. Night, Mom. Love you. (phone beeps off) (sighs) How long do you think before they find us? Depends how hard they look. I'm guessing they'll look pretty hard. I was thinking... I've finally done it. What? Burned every bridge. With Abu Nazir. With the CIA. With my family. I'm more alone now than I was at the bottom of that hole in Iraq. Whatever damage you think you've done, the only way to make it mean something is to stay in the game against Nazir. No, that's over. They need you. Roya said. Believe me..hatever plan they had for me has already been replaced by something else. And someone else. (sighs) I'm done. Let the CIA do what they want. At least I'll finally be able to stop lying to everybody. At least that part will be a relief. (sighs) Will you visit me in prison? I'll probably be in the cell next to you. Which, I have to admit, isn't the future I imagined for us. "Us?" What did you imagine? I'm not sure. Maybe that if we saw this through together, if we finally stopped Nazir once and for all, then you'd be a real hero. And that fact... ...would somehow make everything you did before not matter. That it would all just be about getting... to there. Including what I did to you? Including that. Just wouldn't matter anymore. To either of us. You know how crazy everyone says you are? You're crazier than that. (chuckles) This deal of ours... ...I think it's a way out for both of us. You said you're all alone, and... ...you're not. (sighing passionately) (Carrie and Brody breathing heavily, kissing over speakers) (panting, moaning) (panting, moaning continues over speakers) How far is the takedown team? Man : Five minutes. Don't do it. Estes told us to shut this down. It is premature. Or maybe we should have done this weeks ago. There is a f*cking attack coming. And Brody is our only entry point to Roya and the cell. Why did you tell us where to find them if you were gonna pull this sh1t? You have got to give Carrie a chance. (panting, moaning continues over speakers) She's turning it around. Turning it around? Is that what you think is going on there, really? Turning it around? Really? Turn it off. (turns up volume) No, tell me-- really, I'd like your expert opinion. Is that somebody turning something around, or is that a stage-five delusional getting laid?! I am telling you she can fix this. (Brody, Carrie sighing) She didn't run off to Mexico. She went to a safe harbor site where she knew I could find her. All she's asking for is time. Give her some. Tell the takedown we wait. Copy that. I'm good. (phone keypad beeping) (line ringing) 
 
 (phone ringing) Yes. I want to explain..bout yesterday. That's not necessary. Yeah, it is. Give me a minute. Are you there? I'm here. I've been under a lot of pressure. I know. No, you don't know all of it. There's been things happening. Have nothing to do with... with us. I'm having some troubles at home..ith my daughter. I'm sorry to hear that. Look, I, um... I lost it yesterday, and, uh... I wish I could take back some of the things I said. Did you hear me? I heard you. It won't happen again. You said I'd be part of this thing and I... I just want things to be the way they were. I'm glad you feel that way. Thanks for the call. That's what you wanted, right? And Quinn and everybody else listening, the whole CIA? Yeah, them, too. You think she believed it? Roya? It was the truth. Talk to me next time. Before it gets to be too much. Hey. How'd you sleep? Pretty well. Uh... I guess I felt better after talking to my mom last night. Good. You know what she said, though? She said that she trusts my judgment. That's news to you? My head practically exploded, yeah. If you could hear what she says about you, you'd know. Dana, she thinks the world of you. Can I ask you something, Mike? Sure. Just before my dad got back, you were around all the time. You had practically moved in. And I was thinking, last night, how that must have been hard for you, vanishing from our lives the way that you did. So, was it? Yes, it was. It's difficult. There was no question in my mind what was the right thing to do. And you actually did it. I need to go see someone in Columbia Heights. Do you think that you could give me a ride? Sure. Any response from Roya? Nope. Still waiting. We've doubled up on surveillance, so whatever she does next, we'll be on it. So we're good. Well, "good" is probably an overstatement. No one's talking about throwing Brody in lockup anymore. Just so you know, we tracked you and Brody to the motel last night. So, what..as everyone listening in? To most of it, yeah. I don't know what's worse... (scoffs) Quinn's perverts with their idiot smirks or you giving me that look. "Do I really know what I'm doing? Am I getting too close to him?" Or... whatever euphemism you'd find. Are you getting too close? He was running off the rails. I did what I had to do. So that's all it was. I'm not even gonna to answer that. Well, not too many months ago, you told me you were in love with him. Yeah, and I was more than a little unstable then. It's okay now? Have I lost it again? Is that what you're asking? No, I'm saying, if you're back there again, in that place with Brody... What? It ended badly last time. For you. For everyone. I'm not your daughter, Saul. I don't need you telling me what to do. We just picked up Roya on the security cameras. Uh, where? The Rayburn parking garage. And our favorite congressman just happens to be on his way there. Did I miss something here? No, everything is fine. Good. Come on, you'll want to see this. (tires screech) Turn around. We're leaving. Okay, where are my follow cars? We need to be all over this. Agent  (over radio): We have visual. Nervous? Hmm? No. No, I just have a lot to do today. Really? Your chief of staff said you were wide open. You must be wondering if I recorded your outburst to our friends yesterday. I did. I also reported the call you made this morning. Your apology. If that's the right word. Do we hear those communications? No. Why not? Who's she talking to? Shh! What made you change your mind? Brody : I told you, I was under a lot of pressure. Your daughter. Right. Where did you spend last night? Not at your house, I know that. I was with Carrie Mathison. And you woke up this morning and called to say we were on the same track. Brody : Look, if you don't trust me... Roya : I didn't say that. Brody : You said renew the relationship with Carrie-- which I wouldn't have done, by the way-- but okay, as instructed, I f*ck her, I get the information I can to you, and now you're giving me a hard time about it? I didn't say that, either. No, you don't say anything, do you? You need to calm down. What are you doing? Really? You think that's gon-- Why did we lose audio? Tighten up the follow vehicles now. We cannot afford to lose them. Keep line of sight. And get me two more vehicles in pursuit. Carrie? She knows. Maybe, maybe not. We'll see. I'll go in the follow car with Max and Virgil. All right, but Carrie, promise me, just stay the f*ck back, okay? Where the hell are they going? (baby crying) (crying continues) It was you. I should have known. Maria, shh. She's not mine, if that's what you're thinking. I wasn't. I guess... it was obvious. Some girl shows up in the hospital right after my mother's hit. Of course you killed her. I didn't kill her. Why are you here, then? I was in the car. It's the same exact thing. I..m so sorry. And I'm trying... Trying what? To take responsibility. What does that even mean?! I'm sorry. You're sorry. I want to go to the police. Oh, now you do. When it would just make things worse. What do you mean? I mean it's not the deal. What deal? To keep quiet. Not say anything about it. I got two sisters to take care of, so don't you dare mess that up. You need to keep your mouth shut, because if you tell anyone... I get nothing. (baby wailing) You say you want to help? Go away and never come back. Get out! Get out! (gasping) Hey, are you okay? (panting): Yeah, yeah. Just drive, please. Don't worry, we're almost there. We'll need our headlights soon. Okay... there. (car approaching) Max : Virgil, stop the van. They stopped up ahead; stop the van. (sighs) Target has stopped. County Road 66, vicinity Needham Meadow. Follow One, continue north to 68. Follow Two, turn right at Creek Pass. I want a loose cordon around the target. Very loose-- one mile minimum distance. Carrie? We're holding south. Why'd they stop? We're way back; we can't see anything. Anyone? (sighs) Anyone have visual? Can you turn that off? Do you want to tell me what we're doing here? You say you want another chance. This is it. (footsteps approaching) I think there's a third person. Can anyone else see anything? No, I don't think so. Quinn's pulling them now. (sighs) I don't like this. (chuckles) No one does. We need to protect Brody. I want to get actual eyes on. (sighs) What? It's Carrie-- she wants to take a look. Carrie, you promised you'd stay back. I just want to drive by to see what's going on. Look, I know you're worried about him. We all should be-- he's our only asset. Yeah, okay, one clean pass. That's all. (sighs) (engine starts) (low, indistinct conversation) Are you expecting somebody else? Can you see anything yet? It's dark out here, Carrie. I don't know if I'll be able to see them at all. Max, you want to dim those lights? It's like the starship  Enterprise  in here. Roya : Brody, get in the car. Why? You're a public figure, get in. I think somebody just got in the car. Who? Virgil : A humanoid shape. I told you, I can't see sh1t out here. Okay, wait. Carrie : What is it? Virgil : Roya and somebody. I can't tell. Carrie : Oh, Christ. Mirror it to Quinn. sh1t. Quinn, did you get that? Yeah. We got to stop. Quinn : No, keep moving. We've got to go back. Hey, you're the one who just told us for the last 24 hours to keep Brody in play. Goddamn it, Virgil! Just stop! Quinn, that man slaughtered our agents in Gettysburg. Yeah, I was there. He's got a ton of explosives. Which is why we need to follow him. No, we-we're past that. Nazir's got maybe a half a dozen people on the ground here. We've got two of them in our sights right now-- three, counting Brody-- that's a critical mass. We can shut this down. You hope. All we know is..ou move in, the operation is blown. I think it's already blown. Listen to me-- I am listening, and I'm hearing a bad idea that you wouldn't entertain in a million years if it wasn't for your personal attachment to a terrorist you were boning last night. He's a asset-- our only one-- and he's in danger. Yeah, the whole country is. Carrie, we have got this contained. Stay the f*ck back. That is a direct order. Acknowledge. Oh, Jesus. Carrie, what are you doing? Don't do this! Quinn : Carrie, acknowledge. They just grabbed him. Carrie, stay put. They're gonna kill him. That's an order, goddamn it! Tell me you hear me. sh1t. Carrie! Weigh in here, Saul. What I'm wondering..hat are they doing stopped in the middle of nowhere? Next to the only clearing for miles around. (helicopter approaching, heard over speakers) Carrie : They're loading him into a helicopter. Can you hear me? f*ck! Tell me you hear me! You-- wait, you have to track it-- they're about to take off. We're losing him. Quinn? They're gone. They're... they're gone. They're just gone! (sighs) (sports broadcast playing indistinctly on TV) You're back. Mike. Hey, buddy. We're up five against Miami-- can you believe that? No way. Rough day? I went to see her..he daughter..ven though Dad told me not to. Okay... how'd that go? She basically called me a murderer. Sweetie, you're not. It's how I feel about half the time. (exhales) I'm not gonna go see the police, though. She told me not to. Did you know that they paid her off? (sighs) No. Really? I didn't know... but I guess I'm not surprised. There's a presidential campaign in the works. So, what, it..t just goes away? We're supposed to pretend like it never happened? Because I can't. I killed someone. You didn't. I did. No. We... drove away and just..eft her there, Mom. Shh. (crying) It's okay. It's gonna be okay. (grunting, panting) ♪ ♪ (grunts) (gasping, quietly) Nicholas.
