 I lied. We did walk home together. 
 Then we had a row and when I went back he was gone. 
 I know you're looking for extra money. 
 I have a proposal for you. 
 It's about Joel. No accident. 
 He did have an accident when he was younger. 
 How do you know about that? 
 What's this? 
 You've been watching me, you sick pervert! 
 These are the details of my ex-husband and his girlfriend. 
 I want you to dig up everything on them. 
 DS Backland. What's your name, sir? Nigel. 
 I want you to tell me if one of them is the man you saw with the red car. 
 That's him. 
 Number seven. 
 We've always referred to the killer as a man. 
 I think we're looking for a woman. 
 Nigel Stafford lied to us. 
 Hello? 
 Nigel Stafford? 
 Police. 
 LeAnn. 
 Women's clothes. 
 Put the knife away. 
 Nigel... put the knife down. 
 I thought I heard someone up here. 
 Who's buried in your garden? 
 We're gonna dig it up. 
 Who's buried in your garden? 
 It's my dog. 
 It's your dog? 
 And the clothes, who do they belong to? 
 We know you're the only one registered here. 
 Do you know why we're here? 
 The empty house down the road was occupied by a woman. 
 You lied to us. 
 You said you saw a man. Why did you lie to us? 
 Who are you protecting, Nigel? 
 She's killing innocent children. 
 Is she threatening you? 
 You need to tell us, Nigel. 
 I can't. 
 I can't. They'll kill her. 
 Kill who?

 I met her online. 
 What's her name? 
 Rosio. 
 Rosio Pacchio. 
 How long's she lived here? 
 Two years almost. 
 Illegally? 
 I found my dog murdered... then I got that. 
 They told me what to say to you. I told them what you said to me. 
 I just want her back. 
 Mark's on his way. Why? 
 He says if the murderer's good with tech she'll know if we move the computer. 
 She's inside. 
 Good, you're here. Through there. 
 Listen, um... 
 I think I found something on your ex's girlfriend. 
 About time. Can we please be OK now? 
 Can we talk about this later? 
 It's over there. 
 Can you trace it? 
 It depends how well protected she is. 
 You're gonna type what I tell you but make it sound like you, understand? 
 What if they find out you're here and then they hurt her? 
 You're going to do exactly what I ask you. 
 You've caused enough damage on this investigation already. 
 Let me know when we can start. 
 Now. 
 You start by saying the police brought you in... 
 .. and they're still investigating Vince Whitman. 
 How long does she normally take to respond? 
 "I don't think I can do this any more. 
 I'm afraid the police will find out I'm lying." 
 Please... let Rosio go." 
 "When? Where?" 
 I can only say I'm sorry so many times. 
 So, is that it now? Is this us? 
 Are you never gonna speak to me again? 
 Trust me, you really don't want to hear what I have to say. 
 Anything is better than you not saying anything at all. 
 Sascha? 
 Mr Whitman. 
 Can I talk to you for a minute? 
 I'm actually in a bit of a hurry, so... 
 It wasn't a request. 
 'Hi, it's Gail. 
 Leave me a message or even better send me a text. 
 We had contact, but she broke it off. Mark's trying to trace it. 
 So far there's nothing. What about your end? 
 Since we know when the girl ended up in the lift shaft, we should have an ID by the end of the day. 
 We got an address. 
 We've got an address. 
 60 Forbridge Street. 
 Right, you stay there. We're on it. 
 Hey! 
 What are you doing here? 
 It's fine, Mark knows what he's doing. 
 'Roger that. All units standing by. 
 Eyes on the box. 
 It's empty. 
 Confirmed empty. 
 What do you want? 
 A photo of you three just popped up on the chat page. 
 You've been spotted. Where from? 
 Um... high up. 
 From behind. 
 Slightly to your right. 
 It's a four-storey building, Mark. How high? 
 There's a handrail, some sort of a roof or a terrace. 
 OK. 
 Rav? 
 Rav? Can you hear me? 
 She's dead. 
 Mark's death has shocked us all. 
 He was a truly appreciated and respected member of the policing family. 
 His special abilities, his thoroughness, his professionalism will be greatly missed by all of us. 
 There will be speculations and recriminations about the circumstances surrounding his death. 
 This is subject to an ongoing investigation... 
 ...and we owe it to Mark... 
 ...to bring justice to all the victims of these horrific crimes. 
 Let's pause for a minute's silence while we remember Mark. 
 There'll obviously be an investigation referred through to the IPCC. 
 I'll do my best to keep them off your backs, let you get on with your work. 
 But for now, I want you out of here. 
 Go home. 
 Come back tomorrow. 
 Let me know if there's anything that you need, if you want to talk to someone, anything. 
 Thanks. 
 It was a hidden, unlicensed shotgun. 
 And you had no reason to assume it was there or search for it. 
 I'm sure the IPCC will come to the same conclusion. 
 Six years I worked with the guy. 
 Six years and I hardly knew him. 
 This f*cking case. 
 He liked you, though. 
 I know. 
 Um... my phone, I'm so sorry. 
 It was Professor Malvo, I had to take it. 
 He's had another look at the symbols on the discs. 
 He's now saying that they're there to keep evil in not keep it out. 
 We're just gonna have to think about this tomorrow. 
 It's been a long day. 
 Are you all right? 
 I'm not just talking about Mark, I'm talking about all of it. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'll be fine. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 I think you know why. 
 This is just rumours and speculation from ten years ago. 
 About drugs and prostitution. 
 On a yacht that I was working on. 
 It had nothing to do with me. Enough to put into question whether you're fit to take my children away. 
 I'm not taking them -- they're moving with their dad, who I happen to live with. 
 This is your little war with Jason and I am so tired of being caught in the middle. 
 It's got to stop, Marcella. 
 One way or another. 
 It took me three days to find that. 
 What am I gonna find if I really put my mind to it? 
 Get out. 
 How was the Bulgari? 
 Fine, thank you. You gonna divorce me? 
 Yes. To save the Foundation? 
 I can't live with you any more. 
 But I love you. I want you to stay. 
 You're shagging Tim Williamson. 
 Yes, I am. 
 And with everything that's been going on lately, no-one would have a problem understanding why. 
 Perhaps not. 
 Will they understand why you're trying to frame me for embezzlement as well? 
 I've spoken to Sascha. 
 You don't understand. 
 You're funnelling money from the Foundation to an offshore account in my name. 
 It's not that hard to understand. 
 I wasn't gonna use it. It's insurance for the divorce. 
 Clever move. 
 Well, was there anything else? 
 The police have connected a box of toys to those child murders. 
 They traced the box to me and I traced it to you. 
 If it was bad for you when I was involved in that investigation, what'll happen if you're dragged into it? 
 Infidelity, trying to frame me for embezzlement, getting mixed up in child murders. 
 It doesn't look good. 
 You can keep one thing -- me -- or lose everything. 
 I'll let you think about it. 
 What have you done with my sister? Where is she? 
 Who is this? You know who it is. 
 What have you done with my sister? 
 I don't know. I didn't know you had a sister. 
 You know what I did with Karim. 
 Have you done the same thing with Gail? 
 No, no, no! I haven't got her, I swear! 
 Tell me where she is and I'll give you your money back. 
 I don't want it. 
 I was pissed off, yes, but I didn't do anything to your sister, I swear. 
 Hi. 
 What's going on? 
 You got what you wanted. 
 They're home. 
 Wait here a minute. 
 Becky? What's going on? 
 I can't live like this. 
 You're crazy enough to ruin everything for me. 
 So I'm breaking up with Jason. What? 
 I've told Emma and Edward and I've told them why. 
 I don't know if you can beat Jason, but you've beaten me. 
 Um... 
 Guys, look, before you take those up, shall... 
 Are you happy now? What do you mean? 
 I don't know what Becky's told you but... 
 She said you're blackmailing her, so we can't go to Singapore with her and Dad. 
 It's not as simple as that. You do realise we wanted to go? 
 We were actually looking forward to it. 
 And Edward doesn't want to be here with what happened. 
 But you don't care about that, do you? 
 Darling? 
 You... You don't have to sleep in there. 
 You can sleep with Mummy. 
 I'd rather sleep in Emma's room. 
 If you can remember what the car looked like, that could really help. 
 And Dr Helen can help you remember. 
 You want me to catch whoever did that to Leo, don't you? 
 You could help me with that and I think it'd be good for you. 
 What happened wasn't your fault. 
 I know that you feel bad that you left Leo. 
 And I think if you did this and you helped, it'd be... 
 Well, it'd make you feel better. 
 Hey, I've made breakfast. 
 You don't want some breakfast? No. 
 I'm taking Edward in two minutes. Why not come with us? 
 Oh, God. 
 So, what do you think? 
 OK. 
 You will? 
 Good. 
 Darling, I know... 
 I know it must be so hard for you to be here. 
 I don't really have a choice, do I? 
 What can I do? 
 Do you want me to organise a sleepover with Samantha? 
 I'm not with Samantha any more. 
 Why not? I'm just not. 
 Morning. Morning. 
 What have you done to your leg? 
 I don't know. Nothing. Let me see. 
 How did you get these? 
 Bumped into a table at school. 
 Twice? 
 I don't know where the other one came from. 
 This anything to do with why you and Edward aren't together? 
 No. Promise? 
 Cos if it does, you have to tell me. 
 I promise. He's just... weird. 
 OK. 
 Go and get dressed. Breakfast is ready. 
 Did your mother explain to you how this works? 
 Yes. 
 All you have to do is think about the day when you and your friend walked home from school. 
 I'll guide you and we can stop whenever you want. 
 But that's all I'm going to remember, isn't it? 
 There's not gonna be other stuff? 
 That's completely up to you, Edward. You're in control. 
 OK? 
 So, relax now. 
 Concentrate. 
 You're walking home. 
 You and your friend are having a row. 
 She's a retard! Five... 
 She's not! She is! 
 ...four, three... 
 I said, take it back! ...two... 
 Let go of me! Let go! .. one. You're there. 
 Leo, Leo. 
 Leo, are you OK? 
 Leo! 
 Do it again. He needs to remember the car. 
 He has no memory of the car. Isn't that your job, to make him remember? 
 As we know, there are things... 
 Take him back. 
 Edward. 
 Could you go back to when the car arrives, please... 
 Come on, Leo. ...and focus on it? 
 Wake up! 
 Come on! 
 Wake up, Leo. 
 Leo, are you OK? 
 The car. 
 The car, Edward, come on. Marcella? 
 You need to help me. That car is picking up Leo. 
 Marcella, stop it. You told me you saw it. 
 I'm bringing him back. No. 
 Three, two, one. 
 Now you're back. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No. 
 Are you here to see Tim? Yes. 
 I've got some papers for him to sign for the Foundation. 
 Your husband knows that you're sleeping with him. 
 I know. 
 How do you know I'm sleeping with him? 
 Because your husband told me. 
 Of all the people to tell, huh? 
 Hi. 
 Meet you at the office. Yeah. 
 
 
 
 Uh... hello. 
 How are you today? 
 Right, when this case is over, I want a transfer. 
 Yeah, I'm way ahead of you, already arranged it. 
 Good. 
 Hey, um... I'm sorry I'm late. 
 I was... I'm sorry. 
 Are you OK? Yeah. 
 You? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, listen up, everyone. 
 Look, I know we're all... devastated by what's happened and it's not gonna be easy. 
 We have to keep on it. 
 Yes, Nigel Stafford pulled the trigger, but it was our murderer that made him do it. 
 So, I want us all to remember that. 
 Right, we've got an ID on the girl from the lift shaft. 
 Her name is Seema Faiq-u, 13 years old. 
 She disappeared on her way home from a night out in Clapton on 16th October, 2016. 
 Shoplifting, criminal damage, minor assault charge. 
 Expelled from school the year she disappeared. 
 So, she was troubled like Luke and Billy. 
 Exactly. Right, LeAnn, what you got for us? 
 We have a list of Seema's calls. 
 She phoned KidsCall a number of times before she disappeared. 
 Find out what she could have used for a password. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm busy. 
 Another one of our victims called your helpline. 
 I want records of the conversation. 
 Anyone there can help you. No, I'll do it. 
 I'd hate you to think I'm less than 100 per cent cooperative. 
 Shall we? 
 Hi, have you got anything? 
 Faiq-u. 
 F-A-I-Q, hyphen-U. 
 It's all in capitals. 
 It's the password she uses for all her social media. 
 Yeah, there she is. 
 Print it out. 
 Are you really surprised? 
 I mean, Tim sees something that will help him advance and he goes for it. 
 He's ambitious. 
 I'm not discussing Tim with you. 
 All I'm saying is it was never about me. 
 It's about what I represent. 
 Where's the printer? 
 Right, Seema told KidsCall that she was abused from age 11 by a friend of the family. 
 Adam was also an abused child. He called the helpline too. 
 But what about Luke? He never called KidsCall. 
 OK, well, KidsCall's part of the Whitman Foundation, right? 
 What about the laptop? His foster mum said it was from a charity. 
 Could that be the Whitman Foundation? 
 You didn't believe that. You said she was naive and gullible. 
 Think she targets them through the Foundation? 
 Could be how she chooses her victims. 
 But why? And Billy, as far as we know, never got in contact with the Foundation, nor Leo. 
 Billy knew Vince Whitman. 
 Right. And Leo? 
 Let's take a closer look at KidsCall and the Whitman Foundation. 
 I want to know who works there and anyone who might've talked to or met with these kids. 
 Thank you. 
 Wish me luck. 
 Where's Gail? 
 I don't know. 
 Who are you? Her brother. 
 I don't believe you. 
 What happened to her? I don't know. 
 She was onto something -- and for once she'd got it right. 
 Got what right? 
 Joel Lawrence. 
 You're trying to hide something. She figured it out. 
 Listen, we're not hiding anything, all right? 
 Put the gun down and we can sort this out. 
 She'd never leave her baby. Never. 
 If you think something's happened to her, why don't you just call the police? 
 No. 
 I could call them. 
 Um... let's sort this out the right way. 
 No, put the phone down. 
 Put it down! 
 Is the police investigation ongoing? 
 Can we have a statement, Mr Whitman? 
 Did you speak to the police? Statement, Mrs Whitman. 
 Thank you all for coming. 
 These past few days we have been the subject of speculation and rumour. 
 My leaving our home, for example, it was misinterpreted as an indication that the events of the past week have somehow damaged our marriage. 
 Nothing could be further from the truth. 
 Together we would like to address my husband's very brief involvement in the current police investigation and to address how media coverage... 
 Well, it's harmful to my foundation and by extension of that, those who we are trying to help. 
 But first a piece of news. 
 We have discovered, in the last few hours, an attempt to embezzle huge sums of money from my wife's foundation. 
 What's most tragic here is the man behind this attempted theft is a man we trusted and called our friend. 
 He has enjoyed a prominent position on our board as well as being a respected civil servant with a high rank in the police force. 
 DCI Tim Williamson has been suspended from duty. 
 He has been served a suspension notice and regulation 15 outlining the allegation against him. 
 I will assume responsibility on this investigation from now and I expect work to just carry on as normal, OK? 
 That's all. 
 What's going on? What happened? 
 I don't know. 
 There's talk of embezzlement. What? 
 Do you have something to do with that? 
 Do I have something to do with what? 
 Tim's arrest. What kind of question's that? 
 A legitimate one, after what happened to Dawkins and Whitman. 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 I've worked with Tim. He'd never do anything criminal. 
 You can think that because... We don't know. 
 And we won't speculate. Understood? 
 So, what have you got on this investigation? 
 Eric Donovan fired a gun in Dr Lewis's office earlier today. 
 Dr Lewis -- that's Debbie Canavan's sister, I know that. 
 Who's Eric Donovan? Whitman thinks he's the one that's been blackmailing him, but we haven't enough evidence. 
 And why would he want to shoot Dr Lewis? 
 Something about his sister going missing. She works there. 
 Right. 
 So, the guy who shot at Debbie Canavan's sister is blackmailing Vince. 
 Drink? 
 No. 
 You're angry with me. 
 Give it time and you'll realise you were the one causing all this. 
 I was just being me. 
 And you used to love me. 
 I'm going for a swim. 
 Join me? 
 Hi, Edward. Hi, Mrs Colletti. 
 Um... is Samantha in? 
 No, not yet. Do you want to come in and wait? 
 Does Sam know you're coming? 
 No. She'll be back in a bit. 
 Do you want a hot chocolate? 
 I have this theory, a motive. 
 Can't it wait? No. 
 The symbols were used to keep evil in, right? 
 But these children aren't evil. If anything, they're victims. 
 It's quite common for the abused to become abusers. 
 Adam spoke to KidsCall and said he wanted to hurt his dad. 
 Seema threatened to hurt the girl next door and Luke and Billy are known to the police. 
 The toys around the bodies, the kids' TV in the cells, they were there to keep them innocent and childlike. 
 And what about the lobotomies? 
 To counteract unwanted behaviour. 
 She's stopping them from becoming abusers and hurting others. 
 How are things with your mum? 
 OK, I guess. 
 She works a lot. I bet she does. 
 So, what did you want to talk to Samantha about? 
 Nothing, just... talk. 
 I helped deliver a baby today. 
 Little boy. 
 His mother had a black eye and some bruises and as soon as I saw her and her husband together, I knew he was beating her. 
 I thought, "Is he gonna beat that little boy too?" 
 You just wish for everyone to grow up safe and happy but... it's not always the way. 
 Bad things happen and... 
 .. one day it all becomes too much. 
 And even though you know how horrible it is to be hurt... 
 .. you start hurting others. 
 It's a vicious circle. 
 But it can be broken.
