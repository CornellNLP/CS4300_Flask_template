 Everything is identical to the other victims. Only, he moves this one. Why? 
 Your vehicle was parked at Hallum Street last Wednesday. Did you see anything? 
 No. Sorry. 
 Hey! 
 Bendek? Can't even be bothered to say hello. 
 Serial killers don't take trophies to sell them. My guess is that she stole them from him. 
 We loved each other. And now I have nothing! 
 So I really need this job. 
 You don't get things in life, Jason. You earn them. 
 I don't know where my boyfriend is. 
 Cullen used to sit and watch them die. But whoever killed Liz Harper, Carol Fincher, Benjamin Williams, he couldn't have been sitting over them. 
 Cullen didn't kill them. 
 Thanks, John. 
 Sorry to disappoint you. 
 How did you disappoint me? 
 You failed. 
 Again. 
 I'll be convicted of... attempted murder. 
 And the Grove Park killings remain unsolved. 
 You think? 
 I know. 
 Don't insult me with new evidence or sh1t like that. 
 We've known each other too long for charades. 
 11 years. 
 So, what did she do? Your wife? 
 What, you mean professionally? 
 Why did you kill her? 
 She was gonna leave. 
 Replace me. 
 Have you ever been replaced, Marcella? 
 Given someone everything... only to find out that someone else can do it better, so they just throw you away? 
 It's crushing. 
 People break up all the time. 
 He left you. 
 For someone else. 
 You don't kill them for it. 
 Some do. 
 How did you celebrate this morning, by the way? 
 When we caught you? 
 No. 
 Juliet. 
 It is her birthday today, isn't it? 
 Marcella was right. 
 The original victims from 2005. 
 Look carefully. Tape wound around their necks clockwise. 
 Now, you come to the recent victims, all of them... 
 Anticlockwise. To be fair, we should've seen it. 
 Boss? I erm... have cracked it. 
 s*x tape thing. Cara Thomas? 
 The threat with a knife. 
 We know which one you mean. 
 Good. Erm... 
 So I extracted the ghost code from the cam programme. 
 They were using this masking algorithm that changes the IP address every couple of hours. 
 That's why it took me to so long. So I went back and used a live trace route to track it. 
 And every time -- 
 Standing ovation, Mark! 
 Where did you track it to? 
 Mrs Claire Shaw. Camberwell. 
 Kinky s*x? 
 I'm sorry. I really have no idea what you're talking about. 
 I'm not into all that weird s*x camera stuff. 
 I traced the IP address right to your house. 
 I've no idea what an IP address is. 
 It stands for internet protocol address. It's the number tha-- 
 Mark. 
 Mrs Shaw. Does anyone else have... access to your computer? 
 No, no-one. Just me. 
 Why? What have they done? 
 (Has someone been having s*x... in my computer?) 
 No employees? 
 No-one else has access to it. 
 No. 
 We're a really small business. Look. I've got nothing to do with this. 
 I can barely turn a computer on without crashing it. 
 And yet, you run a business through a website. 
 Well, that's not me. That's my computer man. 
 Matthew Neil. I make his life a misery. 
 Mrs Claire Shaw. How do you know her? 
 Claire Shaw? She's my client. 
 And what services do you provide for her? 
 Website, server, set up her e-mail. 
 And fielding calls, several times a month. 
 Why do you ask? Has she done something? 
 This is a police matter. 
 Yeah, I figured that much. But what has she done? 
 Several times a month? What, has there been problems? 
 Has there been anything but problems? 
 Viruses, malware... Trojan horses, spyware. You name it. 
 Ah! Is it The Destroyer? 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK, yeah. She's an idiot. 
 If her connection's vulnerable to attacks it would be pretty easy for someone to pose as her. 
 Especially someone trying to hide their activity. 
 Hijack her IP. It's straightforward. 
 And that's something you could do? 
 Yeah, I could. 
 So could I. 
 But it wouldn't be good for business. 
 No. 
 Thanks. 
 Does it turn you on? 
 The scent. Does it give you a hard on? 
 Or do you need to tie people up and watch them die for that (?) 
 Mm! 
 Maddy associates that smell with Adrian. 
 So, even if you bought it for her, it would only remind her of him. 
 Who's Adrian? 
 The young man you tried to replace. 
 Peter. You're not very good with women, are you? 
 Is that why they leave you? 
 Use you, like Maddy did? 
 Look who's talking, eh? 
 I managed 15 years with Jason. 
 With your wife... you only managed two. 
 "What is it? Is it..." 
 "Is it because... you have performance problems?" 
 Is that what it's about? Can't you get it up? 
 We found the place... you killed Adrian. 
 We er... traced his phone to the last place he answered a call. 
 And your DNA's all mixed up in his blood. 
 You should've stuck to your M-O. 
 Far less messy. 
 Traditional Polish sausage. 
 Hope you like. 
 Been in a fight, then, Bendek? 
 Your knuckles and the... 
 And the bloody towel in the washing. 
 I was in a fight. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why? 
 Racist guy. 
 Stole my money... and then... he got mad. 
 Because I quit my job. 
 I'm sorry. 
 All right. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. Just erm... got up a little too quick. 
 Right, then. I've got a meeting to get to. 
 Joanne... 
 Dennis... Jennifer. 
 All these victims. 
 So long ago. 
 You know you're gonna get life for the murder of Adrian, don't you? 
 And then you'll just be forgotten. 
 Maddy won't forget me. 
 Oh, she will. 
 She was only interested in... who she thought you were. 
 Not some... pisspot copycat murderer. 
 There's more to me than that. 
 Is there? 
 Yes. 
 I thought you were gonna go down in history. 
 Was I wrong to be obsessed with you? 
 "You know, I kept your case file." 
 "And every now and then I'd be fascinated and I'd... take a look." 
 What a waste of time that was. 
 Yep. 
 You were right to be obsessed. 
 Was I? 
 You see, I understand you. 
 How you feel about being betrayed. 
 I'm not like that. 
 I wouldn't betray you. 
 You men. You're all the same. 
 Big, fat f*cking disappointment. 
 You can admire and respect me. 
 I'd admire someone who got away with murder for 11 years. 
 I'd respect that. 
 But it's not you. 
 You're weak. 
 You're a failure. 
 That's what's disappointing. 
 Joanne. 
 Dennis. 
 Jennifer. 
 It was me. 
 I did it. 
 I killed them. 
 Can I have your attention? We now consider the 2005 killings solved. 
 He has confessed. 
 OK. End of celebration. We've still got a killer to catch. 
 Rav. 
 So it was only 2005. 
 Yes. Tell me we've got some good news. 
 If the computer trail's dead, we've got nothing on that dropped key card. 
 The trophy from Grace. 
 If there was one we've not found it. 
 We've still got a maniac out there. 
 I know. We're back to square one. 
 It's your case. 
 But back to square one is not an option. 
 I only need what you have on the planning department in Lambeth. 
 Andrew Barnes. Yes. I want to stop him blocking DTG's planning proposals. 
 Mr Backland. 
 Victoria. 
 Shall we? 
 Hi. I believe you know Stuart Callaghan. 
 Yeah. I did the Blackthorn job for Gibson's last year. 
 Ah, that's right. 
 Stuart's been our man in the field on this one. 
 Well, shall we? 
 Intelligence on the Lambeth Planning Department. 
 I pay you to get me leverage. Now I need someone. Andrew Barnes. 
 He's clean. Maybe it's because his wife was an MP. 
 The others in the department are more vulnerable. 
 I don't give a sh1t about the others. 
 I need more on Andrew Barnes than just taking antidepressants. 
 You employ us to gather strategic intelligence, Mr Backland. 
 We can't find what isn't there. 
 Well, that went well! 
 Didn't it. 
 Mr Backland. 
 Jason. 
 Look. I'm... really sorry that you're disappointed. 
 This Andrew Barnes fella. Is he an imminent problem for you? 
 Not just at DTG, but for me personally, yes. 
 Right. 
 Well, I wish I could do more, but it's the SIA. 
 What we can and can't do is heavily regulated. 
 I don't care about regulations. 
 I pay you to get rid of my problems. 
 OK. Well, I might be able to help you with that. 
 Not officially. You know. Not through the firm. 
 Fine! 
 Then just do it. And give me a call when it's done. 
 OK. 
 I think I understand. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, you, Miss. You... Do you remember me? 
 Yeah. 
 I was er... I was thinking about that night you asked me about. 
 Right. 
 I remember seeing someone. 
 Leaving the house. Er... a woman. 
 What? 
 Er, she came out... backed up her car, put something into the boot before she left. 
 I thought you were sleeping. 
 I was asleep. 
 But... I woke up. 
 And... I saw her. 
 Long, dark coat with the hood up. 
 The car was a black Audi. 
 What do you want? 
 Sorry? 
 What do you want? 
 I want to help you. 
 To... to tell you. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks, Hassan. 
 I am off. 
 Working part-time now, are we? 
 Yann called. He said he's got a surprise. 
 Hm. Well, say hi for me. 
 If it's a shitty surprise, I'm up for some fun later. 
 Lambeth. 
 You've been fired. 
 How did you get in? 
 I can help you put this project back together. 
 So why would you want to help me? 
 Believe me, it's Plan B. 
 You just can't stand being away, can you? 
 You have to be involved. 
 You need the legal side of things covered. You've got till Monday. 
 And you would know this how? 
 Being informed is what Sylvie used to pay me for. 
 And I can help you deal with Andrew Barnes. 
 Have you heard anything new about Grace? 
 No. 
 Do you think it's Cullen? 
 I know it is. 
 From Marcella. 
 Your wife is investigating the murder of my sister? 
 Can I talk to her? 
 Bring me in on Lambeth. And I want full credit for my work. 
 Fine. 
 OK, let's go. 
 
 
 
 Sorry I'm late, princess. 
 That's OK, Dad. 
 Mum says you're always late. But I know you had to work. 
 Well, the thing is, I've got a little more work to do. 
 But... Who'd like to do deliveries? 
 Me. 
 And Mr Sniffles? 
 Yes. If I can have a carrot afterwards. 
 That sounds fair. Seatbelt. 
 Jason? 
 You know Henry Gibson. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Can I have a word, please? Upstairs. 
 What's that? 
 He just wants to know where you're at with the case. 
 Tell him what you told me. That it was Cullen. 
 It wasn't. 
 I haven't got a clue who it is. 
 When were you gonna tell me that? 
 Calling you about who didn't kill your girlfriend isn't exactly my priority! 
 Well, tell him something. 
 I'm trying to get my job back. 
 And I wanna keep mine. 
 Hey. I'm... sorry. I don't know what he's promised you, but... 
 It's... highly inappropriate. 
 I understand. Just one thing. 
 Why did he move my sister? 
 I don't know. 
 He didn't move any of the others. So... 
 I'm sorry. This is... Yep. Um... 
 Thank you. Good luck. 
 Yeah. I'm sorry I couldn't help more. 
 So you're just gonna leave? 
 Yeah. 
 I can't go back to that. 
 Darling Juliet. 
 Happy birthday, sweetie. 
 So, have you heard anything more from the police? 
 Should I have? 
 IT crimes. They're so boring. 
 Ta-da! 
 What? I don't get it. 
 Well, this is where we had our first dinner in London. 
 And I have made them copy everything. 
 You know. The food... the wine for you... the same table. 
 Everything. 
 You remember what we had? 
 Yeah. Course I do. 
 Crazy. 
 Come on. 
 Go on. 
 Hi. 
 Seven to three. 
 What's that? 
 That's how many times you've talked about Henry and how many times you've talked about me or us during dinner. 
 What are you doing counting? 
 It's just that I really made an effort tonight. 
 Yeah, you did. 
 So why... why destroy it? 
 It's just that you talk about him all the time. 
 Yeah, I do. He's my best friend. And he's going through difficult times. 
 So are we. 
 I moved away from everything. 
 From my daughter... from... my job, everything, to be here with you. 
 Not to be here with you and... Henry. 
 What are you doing? 
 Going to have some fun. 
 Don't do this. Matthew? 
 Marcella! 
 I thought you drove here. 
 I've been at a Premier Lodge. 
 Wife kicked you out (?) 
 Ha-ha. Very funny! You know Mark's hacker friend managed to extract information from that card we found in the old guy's garden? 
 From a Premier Lodge? 
 Yes. And it retains information until it's reprogrammed. 
 I've got the name of the last person who used it. 
 Sit up. 
 Bendek Krol? 
 Yes. 
 Size 10? 
 Sorry? 
 Your shoe size. Size 10. 
 43. 
 What's that? A UK nine? 
 Erm... 37... 
 Yeah, it's a nine. 
 Why I'm here? 
 Before you moved in with the Callaghans, where were you living? 
 With friends. 
 And then er at some... cheap hotel. 
 What did you do with the key card of your hotel room? 
 I think I put it er... in a bowl... on the counter. 
 Why? 
 You didn't take it with you. 
 I just said. 
 I put it in a bowl... on the counter. 
 No. 
 You said you THOUGHT you put it in a bowl on the counter. 
 Well... I did. 
 Can you please... tell me what you were... doing on those dates? 
 I can't. 
 I'm not keeping a diary. 
 What about these... images? Do you recognise any of... any of these people? 
 They are dead. 
 I recognise them... from the paper. 
 OK. So, the landlady couldn't give him an alibi for the attempted attack on Walter Davies. 
 And he's been in a fight recently. 
 With who? 
 Some employer, but she doesn't know who or when. 
 Find out. See if we can get him on GBH if we don't get anything else. 
 OK. 
 Why do you think you're here? Size nine footprints were found at the scene of an attempted murder, along with your key card. 
 And your arrival into the UK coincides with five separate killings. 
 Do you wanna try and remember just that little bit harder? 
 You're late. 
 Come in. She's taking a nap. Do you want a cuppa? 
 Your daughter made them. 
 May was a little worried today. 
 She must've overheard something at her mum's. 
 Well, what did she say? 
 That Mum wasn't gonna let her see Dad any more. 
 Look, Ronnie. I can loan you the money to make up defaulted payments. 
 Thanks, but... you're already babysitting for free. 
 And that'll just be another debt.  
 But I won't take May away from you if you don't pay me. 
 No, I need to fix this myself. 
 But thank you. 
 Mm. 
 What happened? 
 Witness saw it parked here last night. 
 It was still here this morning so he had a look. Driver's shot. 
 Hassan El-Sayed? 
 Yep. 
 That's why we got it. 
 You said he didn't see anything. 
 He didn't. 
 He was outside Gibson's house the night she died and now he's dead? 
 We don't think that's a coincidence? 
 No, we don't. 
 Just er... thinking of a picture for the funeral. 
 Do you have a favourite? 
 No. 
 I think you should probably choose. 
 Stephen. 
 We have sorted Lambeth. 
 Green space, sustainability, accessibility. 
 And we still make... more than decent money. 
 You and Jason? 
 Me and Jason. 
 Couldn't have done it without him. 
 It stays on schedule and there's no grounds for Barnes or anyone to blacklist us from future projects. 
 Well, that's wonderful. 
 Wonderful enough? 
 Then I'll be on my way. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Mm-hm. 
 You bringing Jason Backland back. 
 Who'd've thought it? 
 He offered his services. 
 But I used him. 
 You're the one bringing him back. 
 Talk to me about Krol. 
 He doesn't remember his whereabouts for any of the murders. 
 Premier Lodge are gonna send over the CTTV from their reception from when the key card was last used. 
 I erm... I checked out the dead taxi guy. 
 You're not very good with names, are you, Mark? 
 I am, but... when I say a name, like Hassan El-Sayed, people usually go, 'Who's that?' And then I have to explain it's the dead taxi guy. 
 I'm just being quick. 
 What about the taxi driver? 
 Right. Hassan El-Sayed. 
 Born in Morocco 1986. 
 Comes to the UK in 2004. 
 He's granted UK citizenship in 2009. 
 He works at Canalside Cabs, as we know. 
 He was also hired by another company, Camden Station Cabs. 
 So he was ambitious. 
 That's what I thought. 
 And then I looked into his family. His brother, Mohammed El-Sayed, he comes to the UK about a year ago on a tourist visa. 
 That ran out four months ago. And there's no record of him leaving the country. 
 Around about the same time that Hassan takes the second job at the second cab firm. 
 So I checked the night we know he was working, the night he was outside Grace Gibson's house. 
 He took out a cab from each company. 
 OK. So we've got... two drivers. 
 One licensed. Clearly, his brother had the other. 
 And that explains why he didn't see anything at Grace Gibson's. He wasn't there. 
 Potential eyewitness. 
 Here illegally, so he won't come in willingly. 
 So, let's find him. He might've seen our killer. 
 It's freezing, baby, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 You're so beautiful. 
 Oh, wow! Yes! I'll have some of this. 
 What do you mean? 
 Thank you, baby. 
 Thank you. I'm gonna go back in. OK? 
 Be careful with that, yeah? 
 Excuse me, Miss. What have you got there? 
 Come on. You'd better come with me. 
 Leave me alone! 
 Come on. 
 Now, if you've cleared your bill, you don't need to wait in line. 
 You just put your key card in that bowl. 
 Right. And now. 
 Confirming what he said, Bendek Krol drops his key off. 
 But, look. Seconds later... 
 This guy takes a key out of the bowl. 
 Is there another angle? 
 Erm... there. 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me. I need to see his face! 
 He knows where the cameras are. 
 He's our suspected killer, who dropped the card at Walter Davies'. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 Remember Lea Coombes? 
 Yeah. Cara's flatmate. 
 Cara's flatmate. She's here. 
 Cara gave you this as a present? 
 Didn't realise it was stolen. I thought it was a proper gift. As in one she actually picked out and paid for, like a normal person. 
 Do you know if she stole anything from anyone else around that time? 
 Yeah. A watch and some earrings. 
 And a bracelet, I think. 
 You said the person she stole from was dangerous. 
 Thanks very much, Lea. You can go now. 
 Thanks. And take care, OK? 
 The trophies from the pawn shop. 
 Yeah. So... 
 Cara sleeps with a killer, steals a necklace and is killed because of it. 
 Provided that is Grace's. 
 She had cocaine in her blood when she died. 
 If we can prove it's Grace's necklace, she must've been murdered by our killer. 
 Think it could be hers? 
 (If I'm lucky.) 
 (Please, please.) 
 (Please, God. Please.) 
 (I didn't do it!) 
 (Oh, my God! It wasn't me.) 
 (Sweet dreams, princess.) 
 Jason Backland. 
 "Jason." 
 Yeah, hi, Stuart. What is it? 
 "Got rid of your Lambeth problem." 
 "Andrew Barnes." 
 I spoke to DTG earlier. It's sorted. So... 
 "What do you mean, got rid of?" 
 "Just what you asked me to do." 
 Stuart, what -- 
 f*ck! 
 May? 
 May! Princess? 
 May. 
 May! May! 
 May! 
 May? 
 May!
