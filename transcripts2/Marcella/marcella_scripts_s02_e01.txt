 We found Leo today. 
 Is he dead? 
 Yeah. 
 There's going to be stuff on the news about the day he disappeared and I don't want you to read any of it. 
 I want, if you can, just to disengage for the next few days. 
 Can you do that for me? Mm. 
 Do you want to come home with me? No. It's fine. 
 You can. It's fine. 
 Well, all right. If you need anything, anything at all, or you want to talk or you want me to listen -- - OK. 
 OK. 
 Right, everyone, I want your full attention. 
 This here is Leo Priestley. 
 He left school on a Monday afternoon on 14th April 2014 and he never returned home. 
 He was reported missing that same evening by his parents. 
 You probably all should know that I knew him. 
 He went to school with my son. 
 Now he's a nine-year-old murder victim, so we need to solve this. 
 Mark? - I've gone through the initial reports... 
 Good, afternoon, everyone. I don't want to interrupt but this is LeAnn. 
 She's from my old team. 
 She'll be replacing Alex while she's on sick leave. - Hold on. 
 How come I didn't know about this? Because I never told you. 
 Get her up to speed. Good luck. 
 Hi, everyone. I'm LeAnn Hunter. 
 Cool name. Thanks. 
 Leo Priestley was found dead buried behind a wall last night. 
 That's the file from his disappearance. The owners of the flat? 
 Thea and Gabriel Stanley. They moved in around a year ago but obviously the body's been there much longer. 
 So what about previous owners? Has it been rented out? - Here. 
 A registered s*x offender was questioned in relation to Leo's disappearance -- Phil Dawkins. 
 He was seen a couple of streets away from the school ten minutes before he disappeared. 
 But there was no forensic evidence linking Leo to either Dawkins or his vehicle and he had an alibi. 
 A male colleague who could just as well have been an accomplice. 
 Fair enough. Let's check him out. 
 I don't know why, for want of a better word, all this sh1t's come up again. 
 What were you doing near his school? I wasn't near his school. 
 I'm not allowed to be near schools. 
 Because you like young boys. And young girls. 
 I usually lose interest in them when they get to puberty. 
 Look, sexual activity with minors is, quite rightly, deemed to be unacceptable, which is why I keep myself under control. 
 But I've learned to live with the fact that this is who I am. 
 Mm. Yeah, but you haven't always been able to keep yourself under control, have you? 
 When I younger I let my desires get the better of me. 
 I spent 15 years in prison because of that. 
 Do you know what happens to someone with my genetic predisposition in prison? 
 I can imagine. I really don't think you can. 
 So my fear of losing my freedom again is far greater than the desire to experience my sexuality to the full. 
 But you're still a paedophile. 
 But not a practising one. It's like a sober alcoholic. 
 OK. Are you seriously comparing having s*x with children to drinking too much? 
 It's an illness, the same mechanism is at work, so, yeah. 
 Do you tell people about this illness? 
 Your neighbours? Friends, colleagues? 
 Well, in the judgemental society in which we live, I really can't see the advantage of telling anyone, so no. 
 What if someone did? 
 I think that would be extremely unwise. 
 Really? Yeah. 
 Really, DS Backland. 
 Are we done here? 
 It's a voluntary interview. You can end it whenever you want. 
 Behave yourself. Why? He's a psychopath. 
 I get it -- I'm a father, too, but we're police officers. 
 That's not -- Build a case if there is one. 
 I don't want you going all Henry Gibson on him. 
 There's no need for that. 
 Oi. 
 You are not getting any money. 
 Well, then, I'll tell. I'll tell your wife. 
 She already knows. 
 No, she don't. Simon. Go and get your mum. 
 Mum! 
 How's your little sister? f*ck you. 
 She's missing child support. That's how she's doing, you piece of sh1t. 
 Eric here has something he wants to tell you. 
 There you are. 
 I just can't believe his wife knew about you and the baby. 
 Yes? - He's such an arsehole. Let it go. We'll manage. - Will we? 
 Have you seen where we are? 
 I'm gonna wait outside, all right? - OK. 
 Look! Look, Taylor! What have you got? 
 Have you got a new toy? Eh? 
 And this is where Leo's body was discovered. 
 You can see a two-foot cavity between the Stanleys' flat and the neighbouring property. 
 That's the wall we're looking at. 
 OK. But why put toys in there? 
 To provide a sense of comfort, so he wouldn't feel all alone. 
 Things could be used in the afterlife. 
 Hang on. Watch. What is it? 
 Forensics have marked an area where the mortar on the neighbouring wall has a different chemical make-up. 
 So are we saying the wall's been fixed? 
 We're saying that it's big enough to put a body through. 
 OK, Mark? Yeah, I'm on it. 
 Right, the owner on the flat on the other side is a Reginal Reynolds. 
 Oh, wow, it's him. Who? 
 Reg Reynolds, the drummer from Swiss Coast. 
 Huge band in the '70s. Lower You, Stranded, Stranger Things... 
 How long has he lived there? Registered owner since 1979. 
 I'll get Forensics over there. You two bring him in. 
 Do you recognise him? 
 No. 
 That's the boy we found behind your wall. Have another look. 
 Erm... 
 No. Sorry. 
 Where were you mid April 2014? 
 Er... 
 Erm, my memory, my, erm... it isn't used to be. 
 Er... 
 That's a few years ago. Erm... 
 Have you spoken to... to... Alan? 
 He may know. We're trying to get hold of him. 
 Leo Priestley was put inside the wall from your flat. 
 And you were living there in 2014, weren't you? 
 Yeah, yeah. How do you explain that? 
 Er... I can't. 
 But surely can't you think I've anything to do with that? 
 Your flat, your wall, so yes we can. 
 I was surprised to see Adam in detention. 
 Believe me, I'll talk to him about it. 
 Go and get your things together, please, Adam. 
 Just so you know, the boy he was fighting with is here quite a lot. 
 I am so sorry about all of this. Really, don't worry -- 
 Adam's a good kid. 
 Thank you. 
 Got everything? Yeah. 
 Goodbye, Mr Yusef. - Bye. - Bye. 
 Bye, Adam. 
 Are you going to tell Dad? 
 No, not this time. 
 Speaking of your Dad, I'm working away next week, so you'll be staying with him, so we've got to remember to take everything with us this weekend, Adam. All right? 
 OK. 
 What do you fancy for your dinner? 
 We'll go to the shops on the way home. 
 We can get whatever you want. 
 Marcella? - Yeah? - Do you know if Leo played drums? 
 No. Why? 
 Reg Reynolds was giving drumming lessons up until a few years ago -- private lessons, at home. 
 Why is my son on your screen? 
 His witness statement is connected to Leo's disappearance. 
 If you need to know anything about my son, come to me. 
 I just want to know about Leo's disappearance. 
 Well, I was there at the interview. OK. Good to know. 
 Next time, you come to me. 
 Sure. Good. 
 DS Backland. 
 There's one thing from our last conversation I can't quite let go of. 
 Only one? 
 It seemed that the idea of telling people who I am is the one that appealed to you most. 
 And? I've paid my debt to society. 
 Now I follow all the rules. I keep my urges under control. 
 We can choose what we do but not who are. 
 I didn't choose this. I'm a victim here too. 
 Joshua Anderson was 11 when you turned up at his school and told him his mum was in hospital. 
 You took him prisoner for 16 hours, tied him up and raped him repeatedly. 
 He killed himself in 2003. He was 22 years old. 
 And you're the victim? 
 Before you leave, I am so sorry to have to do this -- 
 They were supposed to walk home together. That was what we agreed. 
 Wasn't it? 
 Only, Edward left him. 
 He was nine. Do you really think this would have happened if they'd been together? 
 Edward left him alone! 
 And my son is dead. 
 Hi. What a nice surprise. 
 Come in. 
 Jason, Marcella's here. 
 Come in. 
 I heard about Edward's friend. I'm so sorry. 
 We talked to him about it over dinner. 
 Hey. - So Edward told you about Leo? - Yeah, he did. 
 I knew about it, anyway. It was on the news. 
 That's exactly why I'm here. The press might find out that Edward left him. 
 OK. - You need to keep an eye on him. It could get really tough. - Of course. 
 We'll both keep an eye on him. 
 Can I have a word with you outside, please? 
 Sure. 
 Right. Are you getting married? 
 Yes. - When we're not even f*cking divorced? 
 But we will be. They're more of a save-the-date, anyway. 
 You've known her for four months. 
 You know when you've met the right one. 
 Jason, she's your f*cking rehab nurse. 
 I'm not going to apologise for being happy. 
 Do the kids know? Yeah. 
 And they're fine with it. They like Becky. 
 Of course they do. She's the same bloody age. 
 Edward should be your priority now. 
 My children always are. 
 Mum was here. I know. 
 Are you OK? Yeah. 
 Are you sure? Yes! 
 Shut the door. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 What are you doing here? I've got a key and I used it. 
 Beer? Yeah, I need one. 
 Jason's getting married. 
 So how long did that take? Five minutes? 
 Erm... four months. 
 They've known each other for four months. 
 No, I meant before you started talking about Jason. 
 All right, well, no-one is forcing you to be here and listen, are they? 
 If you want to deal with him, talk to him about Andrew Barnes and tape it. 
 That'll be great for the kids, sending their father to prison. 
 You admit he's done something he could go to prison for? 
 Stop twisting my words. He had someone murdered. - No. 
 You think he had someone murdered. 
 He's the father of your kids and all that -- I know. 
 I just wish you could stop talking about him all the time. 
 That can be arranged. 
 Yeah, it's me. 
 Who are you talking to? 
 No-one. I was watching YouTube. 
 All right. Well, stop. It's late. You need to get some sleep. 
 I will be back late tomorrow, so Simon's mum's going to pick you up. 
 OK. - Feel better now? - Yeah. 
 All right. Now sleep. 
 And no more looking at that phone. 
 [Oh.] 
 [DS Backland.] [Can you sign in, please?] 
 Ugh! 
 Hey. - Did you come in a helicopter? - Yeah. 
 Are you out of your tiny mind? 
 I'm here. I can work instead of being stuck in traffic. 
 Yes, that's definitely what they can write, how cost-effective it is. 
 Have you read this? 
 Three days in a row. It's starting to affect my foundation. 
 Give it a few more days, they'll pick on someone else. 
 No. Not a few more days, Vince. Fix it now. 
 Do you work here? 
 
 
 
 How old are you? 22. 
 And what type of employment contract have you got? 
 Zero hours. They text me when there's work. 
 The best would be if we could prove that they're wrong. - They're not. 
 How long have you been on that kind of employment? - A year. 
 From a PR point of view, we would benefit from new employment contracts. 
 I'm not going to change what I do. 
 I want you to change what people think about what I do. 
 They changed it when you turned 21? How do you feel about your contract? 
 So we sack staff when they reach a certain age? - We don't sack them. 
 If my lawyer is using that term it's no wonder people are getting it wrong. Sorry. 
 We put them onto zero hours contracts when they reach a certain age. 
 All totally legal. Yes. 
 And then we replace them with 16to 18-year-olds who are cheaper. 
 How are we going to get anyone to accept that? 
 I don't care how. That's your job. 
 Just f*cking do it. 
 Someone was at Reg Reynolds' flat last night. 
 How do you know that? 
 I was there. - Why? To pay my respects to Leo. 
 I had my head smashed against a wall and I was kicked in the stomach. 
 There should have been a police officer there. 
 Fat lot of good he was. 
 Whoever it was must have broken in from the back garden, probably to remove evidence. 
 I'm fine, thank you for asking. 
 I'll get onto Forensics. That's done. 
 I spoke to Tim. 
 Of course you did. 
 Is there a problem between us? 
 Not as long as you bring anything to do with my investigation to me. 
 He's my boss and he's yours, too. You know exactly what I mean. 
 Good. In that case, there's no problem. 
 The legendary promoter and producer Alan Summers is here. 
 Go on. 
 Ah, so, we started on a Sunday, March 16th, in Tirana and we finished on another Sunday, June 22nd, in Tbilisi in front of 55,000 people. 
 And you didn't come back at all in that entire time? - No. 
 That's three months on the road, 16 different countries, record-breaking crowds in Belgrade. 
 It's hard to believe, isn't it? 
 We're more or less forgotten over here. 
 Hiya. Got you a cup of tea, Mr Summers. - Thank you. 
 Is there's anything else I can do -- We're fine, Mark. Thank you. 
 Where were you at 1am yesterday? 
 Erm, I was driving back from visiting a friend in Cardiff. 
 At that hour? Yeah -- I left at 11 o'clock. 
 Alone? Yeah. 
 Name and number, please. 
 According to press cuttings, Reg was famous for his parties at the end of the '70s and throughout the '80s. 
 Apparently a lot of young people would attend. 
 How old would you say this girl is, for example? 
 13? 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe a little older. 
 It was a different era then. 
 What do you mean by that? That it was more relaxed. 
 Just because there were young people about, you weren't considered a paedophile. 
 But they should have been, though, because they were. 
 Yeah. 
 But not Reg. 
 So, can I go now? 
 You've asked about a date in 2014 and he wasn't even in the country. 
 That's when the boy went missing. 
 He could have put into the wall at a different time. 
 Look, I know you can keep him for up to 36 hours but he's an old man -- he's not very well. 
 He had a stroke a couple of years ago and he's got a condition called aphasia. - What's that? 
 It's to do with language. It's words -- he mixes them up, drops them, forgets them. 
 He can stay with me. He's not going to disappear. 
 You didn't tell them anything, did you? - Of course not. 
 They didn't either. What, they didn't ask? 
 No. No, they didn't. 
 Good. 
 Fine. 
 Mark? Check the tour dates for spring 2014. 
 Find out from Immigration if any of the band members were here in April. 
 Sure. Your phone's been going off. I think you got a text or something. 
 Right. 
 Oh. 
 Hey. You're in Edward's class, aren't you? Have you seen him? 
 Yeah, he just left. Someone picked him up. 
 Who picked him up? I don't know. 
 His dad? I don't know. I didn't see who. 
 You just said someone picked him up. Who picked him up? 
 It was just now -- over there, in the red car. 
 [Get off her!] 
 Edward! 
 Is Edward with you? What the hell is going on? 
 Is he OK? - Yes, he's here. What happened? Marcella! 
 Come. 
 You wanted to see me, Mr Jones? 
 Who the f*ck are you? My name's Andrew, sir. 
 No, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
 Where the hell is the other boy? 
 Well, look at you -- you're too... You're too old, you're too tall. 
 You... 
 Just get out, will you? Just get... Just get out, will you? 
 Get the f*ck out! 
 Ugh! 
 Why? Why? Why? Why? 
 Do you want us to move out? 
 I don't want you to move. 
 But, you know, you're just... You're so angry all the time. 
 Not at you. 
 Then at who? 
 I can't let you down, too. 
 You don't! 
 You let us live here and you're great with Taylor and you're not even her dad. 
 You know -- we manage. 
 Yeah but managing ain't enough, is it? 
 Eric, what are you gonna do? 
 Eric! 
 Reg? Where are you? Reg? 
 Reg! 
 Adam. Your mum rang. She's home now. You can get off. - OK. 
 See you. See you. 
 You attacked her in front of Edward. 
 What the hell were you thinking? 
 Not now, Jason. Marcella! 
 Marcella! I thought he was being abducted. 
 By Becky? I didn't see it was her. 
 How could you not see it was her? You dragged her out of her car. 
 Give me one good reason why Becky shouldn't report you. 
 Can you please ask her not to? 
 I can but I need one good reason. 
 One reason. 
 Marcella! I'm not well! 
 All right? I'm not... I'm not well. 
 I get these blackouts and I... 
 I function as if everything is normal and then... 
 But it's not. I get violent and... 
 And then I just can't remember any of it. 
 So the night I came to get my things and you kicked me down the stairs, that was one of these... blackouts? 
 How long have you had these? 
 Since Juliet died. 
 Get help. But I don't know how. 
 No -- me, neither. 
 But you've got to figure it out. 
 Because if you don't, I won't allow you anywhere near the children.
