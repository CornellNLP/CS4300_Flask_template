 Chuck : Mari, sweetie, can you hear me? 
 Mari? 
 Oh, thank God. 
 There you are. 
 Dad? 
 So, have you thought about givin' fashion design a second chance? 
 Monument Point... 
 They're all fine, sweetie. 
 Thanks to you and your new friends. 
 They're not my new anything. 
 Reporter on TV : Thieves broke into the Detroit Museum of Natural History late last night. 
 A spokesperson for the museum confirmed that an unspecified number of gemstones were stolen, including the museum's most recent addition, the lost totem of Zambesi. 
 Such a shame. 
 Patty and I used to love taking you there when you were little. 
 Museum officials refuse to speculate on the totem's... 
 (remote clicks) 
 You need rest. 
 And I wasn't kiddin' about you going back to fashion design. 
 You know what I like about fashion design? 
 Nobody shoots you with bolts of lightning. 
 I tried to beg off, believe me. 
 But don't worry, I'm sticking to my street corners. 
 That a promise? 
 In this city, I've got more than my share of trouble. 
 (panting) 
 (roaring) 
 (grunts) 
 (continues panting) 
 (roaring) 
 (screeches) 
 (sighs) 
 (grunts) 
 
 
 
 The museum heist last night, I want to know who was behind it. 
 I don't know about that job. 
 Don't insult me, Drake. 
 When things go missing in this town, you always know about it. 
 Not this. Scout's honor. 
 You know what animal has the most acute sense of smell? 
 A bear. 
 I can actually smell the lie on you. 
 You don't look like a bear. 
 Give me a name and I'll harass him instead of you. 
 I really don't know. 
 (bear roars) 
 Drake : I don't know who did the museum job. 
 But word on the street, it was bankrolled by some foreigner, from Africa. 
 I'm not packing. 
 And you're not taking. 
 Not until I get my money. 
 Eshu : I've traveled all the way from Zambesi, Mr. Jones. 
 I have no desire to waste time haggling. 
 I'm not haggling. 
 100,000. 
 Take it or leave it. 
 May I see the stones first? 
 I'd like to inspect what I'd be paying for. 
 Ah. 
 This is the one. 
 Hey. 
 This stuff's mine till I get paid, asshole. 
 Oh. 
 Your payment is forthcoming, Mr. Jones. 
 The hell? 
 (screaming) 
 Finally. 
 (growling) 
 (grunts) 
 (man grunts) 
 You look just like your mother. 
 (theme music playing)
