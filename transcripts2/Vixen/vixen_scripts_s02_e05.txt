 Good evening, people of Detroit. 
 My name is Benatu Eshu. 
 As of this message, I am no longer a representative of the Zambesi government. 
 Eshu : Pain and destruction and fire are about to rain down on your fair city. 
 For this, I apologize. 
 But one woman has it wither her power to stop this apocalypse. 
 She knows what she possesses and she knows that I want it. 
 And when it is mine, the death will end. 
 I promise you all that. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Really not a good time. 
 I found a song in the archives. 
 It says each totem has a center, it's auri. 
 It's like a soul. 
 If you crush the soul, the totem will lose its power. 
 Okay, I'll just ask Eshu if I can borrow his totem for a minute. 
 If anyone can do this, it's you. 
 You are meant for this battle, Mari. 
 Equal forces, different elements. 
 Mari... 
 As you burn, try to remember that I wanted to handle this as human beings. 
 I think your firery buddy wants to get your attention. 
 He's got it. 
 (grunting) 
 (grunts) 
 (bellows)

 (roars) 
 (grunting) 
 (grunts) Is that all you are able to conjure? 
 There is not a single animal walking the earth that can hurt fire. 
 Oh, I can think of one. 
 Please, enlighten me. 
 A canary. 
 
 
 
 (grunting) 
 (grunting) 
 (groans) 
 Do you have a single friend who can defeat me? 
 Not a friend. 
 A sister. 
 (grunts) 
 For what you did to my village, my family, I will see you drown. 
 Keep hitting him, Kuasa. 
 (grunts) 
 (grunting) 
 (Eshu grunts) 
 Kuasa, run! 
 No, I am not our mother. 
 I will not run from this fight. 
 (yells) 
 No! 
 Water cannot defeat fire. Nor can your spirit. 
 And I will break your spirit, I promise. 
 And then I will do that which I should have done to your mother, I will kill you. 
 (theme music playing)
