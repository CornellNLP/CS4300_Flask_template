 (crickets creaking) 
 You really expect me to believe that an ancient all-powerful water totem is just collecting dust in some guy's house in Star City? 
 The water totem changed many hands before finally finding its way to auction in your country. 
 Two months ago, it landed here. 
 Its current owner believes it to be a collectible. 
 You've been tracking it all this time? 
 In the hopes that one day I might have the strength and the wealth to bring it back to Zambesi, where it belongs. 
 First thing's first. 
 (snarls) 
 (squawking) 
 Felicity, this is how I talk to you, right? 
 Felicity : Loud and clear. 
 (pinging) 
 Speaking of clear, the house is empty. 
 (beeps) 
 We got to the big lion thing. 
 Where do we go next? 
 Around the back. Wow! 
 This place is big. Keep an eye out for... 
 Guard dogs. 
 How'd you know? 
 (growling) 
 (snarling) 
 (yelping) 
 Good doggies. 
 This room must be worth a fortune. 
 Forget that. Look for the totem. 
 (squawking) 
 There! 
 (grunts) 
 What're you doing? 
 I'm sorry, little sister. But you have no idea what it feels like to be this weak. 
 And now I'll never have to again. 
 (roaring) 
 (growls) 
 Uh... Guys, everything okay out there? 
 Mmm. The spirit totem was always meant to be mine. 
 But I suppose I'll have to settle for this one. 
 You lied to me! 
 I couldn't do this on my own. 
 (growls) 
 (glass shattering) 
 And there goes the security system. 
 (security alarm blaring) 
 (growls) 
 (whooshing) 
 (grunts) 
 (police siren wailing) 
 I'll let you handle them. 
 (meowing) 
 Sick 'em. 
 (growling) 
 (roaring) 
 (glass shattering) 
 (hissing) 
 (grunting) 
 
 
 
 Hey there. I am The Atom. But you can call me "Plan B." 
 Turns out your sister doesn't trust you as much as you thought. 
 Better hold on tight, she's slippery. 
 Come on, all this bleeding edge tech and you don't think they'd make it waterproof! 
 (grunts) 
 (grunts) Sit down. 
 Stay awhile. 
 Looks like you've won again, little sister. 
 So now what? 
 Now you help us. 
 Like you promised. 
 Eshu killed our father and destroyed our home. 
 You want revenge? Well, I do too. 
 Even if I have to work with you. 
 You have the water totem, which means we need your help to stop it. 
 You will all fight him? 
 And we'll win, together. 
 Felicity : Hey, guys. 
 I hate to break up the family reunion, but we've got a problem. 
 Run! 
 Your fire guy's in Detroit and he's kinda going like a rampage-y thing. 
 (screaming and shouting) 
 Avenge your village. Save mine.
