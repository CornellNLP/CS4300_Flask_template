 You'd broken up with him, and you two never, you know...     
 We never slept together?     
 Right, so I honestly felt like it could be okay.

 I didn't want your "no" to stop me from doing what I wanted to do.     
 Deep down, I guess I suspected you'd disapprove of me and Remy.     
 I wanted to explore a relationship with him, so I jumped in before you could say no.     
 It's the same with the book, maybe.

 Whatever it was had us so out of our minds.     
 That was a long time ago.     
 Seven, eight years?     
 Whatever it was, still one of the best nights ever.     
 One minute, you were downing jell-o shots, and the next, you and Tom were all over each other.
