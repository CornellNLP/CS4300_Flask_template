 Hi. How was your flight? 
 He needs his father, Davis. 
 It's important that you're around, especially now, when you're not playing. 
 I would think you would use this time to rebuild with him. 
 Charley, I always want to be there for him. 
 But the fact of the matter is, my time is about to get a lot more limited. 
 I'm signing with a new team this weekend. 
 What new team? 
 New York. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Me and Felix back at it, one more shot at that fifth ring, like we always said. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 You'll make it happen, Davis. 
 You always do. 
 It's yours. 
 You mean that? 
 Of course I do. 
 For whatever's happened between us, two things are sure... you'll always be Micah's father... 
 ...and I'll always be your biggest fan. 
 I don't know what to say, Charley. 
 Come have a good talk with Micah before you take off to New York. 
 Meet us at the high yellow, 6:00 P.M.? 
 Absolutely. Okay. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 I'm surprised you picked up, Lena. 
 I thought we had an agreement. 
 But I see you decided to put your dirty laundry in the street instead. 
 No, I've decided to call your bluff. 
 Excuse me? 
 Look, you can't play that tape to anyone, even if you do have it, which I doubt you do. 
 You'll be sued and prosecuted if you're caught leaking it. 
 And I know you. 
 You're way too careful for that. 
 You poor thing. 
 You don't know the half. 
 So yeah. 
 Good luck with whatever you think you're doing. 
 Just try not to mess up Felix's career any more than you already have. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Ringing] 
 Frank Rovner. 
 Frank. Charley Bordelon west here. 
 [Ding] 
 I don't know what to say. 
 "Thanks" don't seem big enough. 
 You don't have to say anything. 
 But I want to. 
 Thanks for being involved in all this, you know. You didn't have to do that. 
 You didn't have to do none of it. 
 I looked out for you, like good people looked out for me. 
 Now, you're gonna do the same for somebody else. 
 That's the cycle. 
 I hear you. 
 I think you're gonna dig Montgomery. 
 The Mays live 10 minutes from the community college. 
 And my girl Gina's got that library job all worked out. 
 I won't let you down. 
 I already know that. 
 Have some fruit for the road, couple of succulent plants for your new room. [Chuckles] 
 Veggie seeds. 
 Plant 'em somewhere. 
 Feels good to watch 'em grow. Promise. 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Car door closes] 
 I got him. 
 I know. 
 Be safe on the road. 
 You bet. 
 [Cellphone vibrates] 
 Calvin : Hi, beautiful. 
 Hi, you. 
 You busy? Writing? 
 Yeah. But I want to talk to you. 
 You want to talk? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Or you want to see me? 
 [Chuckles] Do I have a choice? 
 Why don't you look out your window?

 I'm so sorry.

 I just want to breathe you in. 
 Come inside. 
 No. 
 I want to do things different, better. 
 ♪ Don't you let it go, don't you let it go ♪ 
 Okay. 
 I want to take you out for dinner and drinks... 
 Dancing in public. 
 Yes. 
 We can do that. 
 ♪ Stay a little while ♪ 
 Your mother and I want you to know that you have always been and will always be our first priority, no matter what's going on between us. 
 Look, I know it's been rough. 
 But, uh, I want us to try to be like we were, you know, you and me. 
 Can you say something, son? 
 Tell me what you're feeling. 
 I feel like I don't want to be here having this conversation, to be honest. 
 Micah. Your father's trying. 
 You're falling for this? 
 Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. 
 Now, you will not be disrespectful. 
 You can be mad. And you can be hurt. 
 But you're not gonna talk to your mother like that. 
 No, no, you don't get to tell me what I will or won't do anymore. 
 I'm sorry, but no. 
 I don't believe you. 
 I don't believe anything you say. 
 I don't believe you care about me. 
 You don't. 
 You don't love me. 
 You sure don't love mom. 
 The only thing you care about is yourself. 
 I'm not falling for anything, Micah. 
 But I will believe your father if he proves himself. 
 Prove to your son what you say is true. 
 Frank Rovner, Davis west. 
 It's good to see you again, Davis. 
 You too. 
 I want to win. 
 I want to build a championship team, Davis, quickly. 
 And I need a champion to do that. 
 I want to invest in you. 
 You want that fifth ring. 
 Everybody knows that. 
 And you need a quick rebuild to get it. 
 And we can do that. 
 New York, it's a media cesspool just waiting to take you down. 
 But Nola press and New Orleans Stingers fans will embrace you, especially with Charley and Micah by your side. 
 I'm in. 
 [Chuckles] 
 All right. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Where is everybody? 
 I wanted you to stop by little early. 
 Okay. 
 Uh... 
 What are we doing? 
 You're listening. 
 And I'm apologizing. 
 Ohhhhh. 
 This is the apology... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ...for forgetting our date? 
 Yes. 
 This is my apology... 
 ...for forgetting... 
 ...our first date. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mm. 
 I love these L.A. apologies. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You can stand me up more often if you want. 
 [Laughs] 
 Nope. 
 Never again. 
 Well... 
 I have something to apologize for too. 
 I slipped during a conversation with Ralph Angel. 
 And, um, I mentioned the mill. 
 Sorry. 
 Look, I know it wasn't my place to tell him. 
 But he does have a right to know. 
 When he knows should've been my choice. 
 The deal isn't done yet. 
 Ralph Angel is... he's immature. 
 I just wanted everything to be sorted before I told  anyone...  especially him. 
 I don't think you see what everyone else sees. 
 Ralph Angel's really stepped up. 
 He researched that refrigerated truck strategy well. 
 So you don't want me to buy the mill? 
 You already have one business that isn't even off the ground. 
 We haven't had one harvest. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Whether I agree with you or not, I'm here to support you. 
 I called a meeting. 
 Most of the farmers have agreed to come to hear you out about the mill. 
 So I present a workable, realistic plan with the trucks and the out-of-town mill, and all that just gets ignored while you do your own thing? 
 Since when do I have to ask your permission to pursue a business opportunity? 
 Since you plan to use our farm as the first account. 
 Probably a good idea to run that by the owners, no? 
 And whether you like it or not, that includes me and Nova. 
 Listen, you should've made sure we knew. No doubt. 
 We need to know what you're doing before you do it, period. 
 But that being said, this is a badass deal. 
 And I'm proud as hell for you trying to pull it off. 
 Can you imagine a black woman owning and operating her own mill? 
 Come on. What?! That's amazing! 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Really, this is, like... why didn't you tell me? 
 I mean... 
 I wanted to tell you. 
 I really wanted to. I really wanted to. 
 No. I know. Things have been a little... 
 Um, I'm down with the sisterhood and all that. 
 I really am. 
 But I got Blue to think about. 
 What makes you think the refineries will still give you the same bump as the boudreauxs? 
 The crop advisor told us how much a haul was worth. 
 Bottom line is, you're gambling with our money, Charley. 
 That mill'll probably take, what, six months to get up and running? 
 Let's just make a deal with St. James now. 
 Our first harvest, see how it goes. 
 Then you can do your mill thing next year. 
 I'll get the mill up and running. 
 There's no gamble for you. 
 If it doesn't work out, I will pay the crop advisor's estimate myself. 
 A sugar mill don't run on 200 acres of cane. 
 How are you gonna convince 20 farmers to drop everything and grind with you? 
 I already set an emergency community trust meeting. 
 Ralph Angel, if it happens, could actually wind up being a game-changer for this community, do a lot of good for a lot of people in the long run. 
 Why can't you do what we agreed to, what daddy wanted? 
 He wanted to win, which takes more than seed cane and refrigerated trucks, Ralph Angel. 
 It takes beating these people at their own warped game. 
 It's a whole system. Why can't you see that?! 
 We can't play it small. 
 This is  exactly  what daddy wanted. 
 You're wrong. 
 Okay. 
 Everybody ain't playing games like you, Charley. 
 Pops wanted to live on his own two feet. 
 He wanted to work his land and bring in enough so he could do it again the next year. 
 He wasn't trying to build no empire. 
 Don't put this on him. 
 This is all about  you. 
 With all due respect, Ralph Angel, this is happening. 
 I need you to be on board. 
 Go ahead. Do it. 
 Y'all gather your farmers. 
 See how many decide to leave the boudreauxs just to play your games with you. 
 Good luck with that. 
 Y'all excuse me. 
 
 
 
 [Door opens] 
 Ralph Angel! 
 Ralph Angel. 
 Please, aunt Vi, I don't want to hear none of that. 
 This ain't about that. 
 Y'all will fuss and fight however you see fit. 
 I'm asking after Hollywood. 
 He left St. Joe. 
 What? 
 All that Charley drama, I forgot to give you these... his divorce papers from Leanne. 
 Got to the farm day after you left. 
 That's what he was waiting for. 
 He didn't want to come to you empty-handed. 
 He was trying to come correct. 
 Well, why didn't he just say that? 
 He tried to. 
 W... where is he, Ralph Angel? 
 Went and caught a shift on the rig. 
 He said he was gonna rent a place somewhere. 
 How long has he been gone? 
 Right after he saw you grinding on some man at the juke. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Hey, Vi. 
 Hey, Hollywood. 
 I'm glad you picked up. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Ain't got nothing to say, Vi. 
 I... I know about the divorce. 
 I should've... I should've listened to you. 
 I... I was having a problem with trust. 
 I understand. 
 I did the damage, and I got to pay the price. 
 I get that. 
 But we can fix that. 
 That's what I was trying to do. 
 I know. I know. I just... I just needed time. 
 Yeah, now  I  need time. 
 Hollywood, that man ain't nobody. 
 And nothing happened. It was just a dance. 
 I took a long haul. 
 How long? 
 Six months. 
 Hollywood, w-w-w... why did you go and do that? 
 I got to go, Vi. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Ms. Celeste taught us all of the colors. 
 Oh, yeah? Did you learn your name? 
 Yep. Azul. 
 [Gasps] Azul? 
 Hey, I like that. 
 You know, I'm gonna start calling you azul from now on. 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yes. 
 Pop, no. 
 Azul Bordelon. 
 I think it's perfect. 
 How that sound? What you say? 
 I love it. That's it. 
 No, you guys. 
 Yeah, that's it. That's it. 
 Yes, you guys. 
 That's it. 
 I'm gonna start coloring this one in. 
 You better hurry. 
 It's almost time for that community trust meeting thing. 
 Nah. [Chuckles] 
 I ain't going. I'm good. 
 What do you mean? 
 She don't respect me no way, don't respect nothing I say or do. 
 I just got to accept it. 
 Ain't no point sitting up there acting like I have a say. 
 It's not about her respecting you. 
 Respect  yourself. 
 You always know what to say. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 What I'm proposing is a collaborative, where we stand together and advance together. 
 It doesn't have to be the way it's always been. 
 I'm investing the capital to purchase the mill. 
 And for every farm that joins me in the inaugural harvest this year, I'll pay the contract penalty with the current mill plus a bonus of 5% on top of your bottom line. 
 It's a risk. 
 I'm an outsider. 
 And... It's a risk. 
 There'll be bumps along the way. 
 But I invite your feedback on  everything. 
 Help me build this. 
 Tell me what we need to do to thrive. 
 We want to win for all those who lost, for all the people who came before us who struggled and strained so we could be here right now making this decision, making it better. 
 It's our turn to try. 
 They risked for us. 
 Why can't we do the same? 
 Yeah. We got this. We got this. 
 I want change. We can bounce back. 
 Right now. 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 Appreciate that meeting. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Thank you, too. 
 No problem. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 I appreciate it. 
 All right. Good to see you. 
 Thanks for organizing that. 
 Hey, that was a good meeting. 
 I'd say "your place or mine," but I don't have a place. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 My place it is, then. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 I'm sorry. I have to take this. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Hello? 
 Davis : I need to talk to you. 
 What's wrong? 
 I need to see you. 
 I need to know that what happened today is real. 
 Frank seemed very authentic to me. 
 And he's already forwarded a proposal. 
 It's real as real can be. 
 Charley, I mean us. 
 I just need to know. 
 Davis, I'm... 
 I just did what I felt in the moment. 
 Can it be more than a moment, is what I'm asking. 
 Are you willing to try again, Charley? 
 Is that possible? 
 Yes. 
 It's possible. 
 Come see me, baby. I need you, Charley. 
 I need to know we can be us again before we close this deal. 
 Charley? 
 I'm on my way. 
 I can come over later, if you want. 
 Is that okay? 
 No. 
 No. It isn't. 
 Good night, Charley. 
 I knew it. 
 I knew it. 
 I know you, Charley. 
 You know, I don't know what angle was your plan. 
 I've been trying to figure it out. 
 But you're always... you're always five steps ahead of me. 
 So who the hell knows, huh? 
 I always knew deep down that this was never gonna happen again. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm not signing here. 
 Sign for Micah. 
 He doesn't want me, Charley. 
 I'm no good for him right now. 
 He's better with just you... and the family. 
 One day, it'll be better. Just... Not right now. 
 How did we get here? 
 I loved you so much. 
 I gave you every ounce of everything inside of me. 
 Every dream. 
 Everything. 
 You were the world... 
 ...and every star in the sky to me... 
 Unconditionally. 
 And now... 
 ...you're one of those men... 
 ...too old to be out playing the field but don't even know it, thinking you're cool while everyone is quietly laughing behind your back. 
 Didn't have to be this way. 
 We all make our choices, don't we? 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Mid-tempo music plays] 
 Charley : Felix Evans. 
 You're so easy to find because you're so predictable. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I could ask you the same question. 
 But, then again, Lena doesn't much care what you do these days, does she? 
 'Cause if she did, she would've been smart and taken my offer the first time. 
 You know all about it, I assume? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, she was wrong. 
 Leaking that tape of Melina's deposition about you raping her wasn't a threat. 
 It's a fact. 
 That tape will be  everywhere  tomorrow if you don't handle this conversation correctly. 
 Look, I don't want trouble. All right? 
 Good. 
 Champagne? 
 I don't, either. Thank you. 
 I'm happy to turn fact to fiction. 
 That's up to you. 
 I'm not playing in New Orleans, Charley. 
 Ronetta Miller, Cheryl Amador, Caprice Littlejohn, Lalette Green. 
 Who? 
 Oh, I'm s... I'm sorry. 
 You probably know them as Bllack Diamond, Spanish Rose, Lucky, and Sweet Tea. 
 They're all ready to talk. 
 You bluffing. 
 Am I? 
 How you know? 
 Let's just say Melina Galudian isn't Goldie anymore. 
 Now she's a woman on a mission... a mission I support. 
 See,  she  can't talk about the settlement. 
 But these other women can. 
 Wait. Wait. But I didn't do nothing crazy with them. 
 Mm. "Crazy." 
 Crazy is in the eye of the beholder. 
 But we can let the police and the press help you figure that out. 
 Listen. 
 Felix, you still have choices. 
 You can play for the Stingers here in Nola for a fair price. 
 And I'll make those names go away. 
 Or you can ignore my advice, go to New York, and see what happens when women start coming out of the woodwork. 
 The smart choice is to take the best deal you can get. 
 Tell New York you won't sign if they take Davis. 
 And wire $5 mil into the account that I provide. 
 $5 million? 
 $5 mil is doable for you. 
 I know the ins and outs of all of your endorsements. 
 Before you were dropped, you made a very tidy sum. 
 This is happening. 
 And it's happening now. 
 I need this resolved before your afternoon flight to New York tomorrow. 
 So just nod, and I can get the hell out of here. 
 Good. 
 I'll text you the account details. 
 Oh. 
 And if you ever violate a woman again, Felix Evans, I swear to god you'll have hell to pay. 
 I will personally see to it. 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 It's Charley. 
 Frank Rovner, Charley. 
 Thank you for keeping your word. 
 Davis' deal closed this morning. 
 And I keep my word. 
 The $5 million will be in your account by end of week. 
 Yes. 
 Actually, Frank, I'll need you to wire $4 million to me and $1 million to the nonprofit of my choice. 
 I know you're good at this, but if I end up getting a tax deduction out of the whole thing, I am personally starting the Charley Bordelon west fan club. 
 [Chuckles] 
 That would be the Charley Bordelon fan club. 
 Sell him as the bad boy instead of the family man. 
 I can do that. 
 And good for you, Charley. 
 Good for you. 
 That nonprofit is called SWOP, Frank, the s*x workers outreach program. 
 Make note to the organization that the wire's being made in the name of Melina Galudian. 
 Got it. 
 Suit. 
 Trying to impress, like old times. 
 Shall we? 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Mid-tempo music plays, indistinct talking] 
 [Slow music plays] 
 Calvin. 
 What's going on, brother? 
 Bruce. What are you doing here? 
 Out with the missus for her birthday. 
 Look at this beauty. Hello, pretty lady. 
 Thank you. Hello. 
 What are you doing with this guy? 
 You like that magazine-cover type, I guess. 
 Bruce Benson. 
 Nova Bordelon. 
 I know who this is. 
 This is that bitch from the daily news, the one set on burning the entire police department down. 
 You can back it up now. 
 So this is you? 
 Let's go, Calvin. 
 He's drunk. 
 I heard you left your wife for some new piece. 
 You turn your back on your brothers in uniform, too? 
 Ooh, that must be some good ass. 
 Man : Hey! Hey! 
 Break it up! 
 Take it outside! 
 You're a disgrace to your brothers! 
 You should be ashamed of yourself! 
 Get your ass outside! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Out! 
 [Door slams] 
 Ralph Angel? 
 Ralph Angel : Yeah? 
 Can you help me with something, please? 
 What's going on? 
 I'm, um, trying to use the shelf. 
 But something's blocking it. Can you get it for me? 
 Come on. Watch out. 
 [Grunts] 
 What is that? 
 What is it? 
 It's locked. 
 I don't even know where the key's at. 
 Pop's handwriting. 
 "To my dearest children, I, Ernest Bordelon, in sound mind and body..." 
 He wrote this a couple months ago. 
 "To my dear children, I, Ernest Bordelon, in sound mind and body, am revising my last will and testament." 
 "I hope no one needs this for a long time. 
 And I hope I can do this in person one day. 
 But if I can't, this paper will have to stand in for me." 
 "I've made the decision to pass this land, the land of my mother and father before and his father before him, to the child of mine who needs it the most... 
 Ralph Angel." 
 Ernest :  "You, Ralph Angel, are more than you know. You and your sisters are the moon and the sky and the stars to me, each of you. But this land is yours." 
 "Whatever has happened, whatever you've done in the past, never forget that you are better than you think." 
 "You're smarter than you think." 
 "You are stronger than you think." 
 "Take this land. Build a home here. Build a family for you and Blue here. Build our cane here, stalk by stalk. Build a good life here, Ralph Angel, so when you get to the end, you can look back and be proud of your days on this earth, on this land. It's all yours, son. Do right. I know you can." 
 "Until we meet again. Pops."
