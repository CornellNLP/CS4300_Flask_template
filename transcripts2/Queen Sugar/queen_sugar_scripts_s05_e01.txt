 Last season on "Queen Sugar"... 
 I read your sister's book. 
 We're more alike than not. 
 You threw Darla's past right up in her face. 
 NOVA: Darla relapsed. 
 My past led me to you, and that led to me to want to be a better man. 
 There are all these different support groups for women at St. 
 Jo's,   and not one for men. 
 The migrant workers that were killed during the hurricane... 
 Why didn't you tell me it cost two men their lives? 
 I am officially announcing my candidacy for city council. 
 Fighting for what's right, that's what I want to do. 
 I rescinded my acceptance letter to Harvard this morning. 
 How dare you, Micah? 
 Don't no man have the right to take advantage of you. 
 That's rape. 
 - [SIREN WAILS] 
 - CHARLEY: The mill's on fire. 
 Whoever did it, I'm glad for it. 
 MAN: You're under arrest for conspiracy to commit arson. 
 Don't you dare put those things on me. 
 - Please send my father in. 
 - What on Earth? 
 And I will take your land. 
 It'll never happen. 
 What I see now is more brave and beautiful than I ever seen.

 Mm, maybe you didn't, but I sure did. 
 But you didn't know me back then. 
 I was what the old folks called "too much."

 We ain't never done nothing like this before. 
 The Feast of St. Josephine. 
 You can count on Charley to think of a new way to celebrate her new term. 
 Unh-unh. 
 I'm proud of her. 
 All this time, and folks just now realizing that St. Jo was named after a Black woman? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Well, you know... 
 I think everything should be named after a Black woman.

 There, see. 
 Now you just trying to get some.

 It's a dessert.

You have been tried and convicted of a conspiracy to commit arson against the Queen Sugar Mill. The fact that we have allowed you to receive your sentencing behind closed doors is a favor based on your previous standing in this community.

I called this emergency council meeting... In the middle of the night. [CROWD MURMURING] Let the record show that despite the fact that half the Black-owned farms just received a notice invoking an eminent domain seizure of their land, Councilman Jackson Fontenot is more concerned about his beauty rest. Because I warned you, Councilwoman. That red tape would only hold     Beckington Group off for so long. You gave the farmers false hope. At least I'm trying to give and not just take. What have you been doing, Jackson? Oh, wait. I remember. You've been running around, telling everyone in St. Jo that the highway would actually be good for them. It would be better for all of us. Man, you a sell-out, Jackson. That's what you are. - Look, I hear you. But listen... - Y'all forgot. Y'all said we would have enough time to figure things out, right? - Mm-hmm.

But my clients actually see her use of bureaucratic red tape these last few months as an attempt to defy the will of the people while also saving her family's sugarcane farm. - You got to be kidding me. - PARKER: Fact. The people voted for the highway to proceed. They also voted me in to stop it. Or to work with us to move this town forward in as peaceful a way as possible. We issued the eminent domain notices now so those affected will have plenty of time to make arrangements. How kind of you. Charley. Oklahoma. What does Oklahoma have to do with what's happening in St. Jo? Everything, Your Honor. I recently published an exposé on the Beckington Group's disregard for the local environment in a recent project they completed in Oklahoma. The town was recently classified as a cancer alley... Which confirms their pattern of reckless behavior. That was one isolated circumstance out of dozens of projects that haven't had any problems at all. According to you. St. Jo needs more time to complete an independent environmental impact report before any of the eminent domain evictions can be carried out. Your Honor, the people voted, so therefore... I'm issuing a stay on those notices until that independent environmental impact report can be completed. Thank you, Judge. I'm also ordering that the proposal include alternate routes for the highway... Routes that don't include the Bordelon farm and will impact the least amount of people losing their land. Are we clear?

I'm not here to make threats. I'm just here to sweeten the deal for the farmers.
