  Before he was your Daddy, he was my friend.

  Some nights, he wouldn't say a word. 
  Other nights, he did. 
  He told you about those white men who attacked him at the bait shop? 
  Yeah. 
  One of them actually came out to the farm, planning to do you harm. 
  Now, your Daddy fought that man and almost killed him. 
  Said it was like being back in the war doing what he had been trained to do. 
  But then... 
  then there was a moment when they're both covered in blood and dirt, and the man's barely conscious. 
  Your father heard your mother singing to Ralph Angel. 
  He had woke up crying, but it was Trudy's voice that brought him out of the dark. 
  Mama had a voice clear as a bell.

  So pure and clear. 
  Brought him to himself. 
  And he ended up helping the man. 
  He dropped him off at the hospital, and then he came on back to the house. 
  But... 
  but I saw him digging. 
  What you saw was your Daddy burying his pain, his anger. 
  Now, he took off them bloody clothes and the bat he used and anything that reminded him of that night, and he buried it deep. 
  He was hoping to forget that he'd been trained to kill, and he saw that it was still in him to do it again.

  As you can see there, Mr. 
  Williams has been a model citizen during his parole. 
  That, plus the fact sheriff Guidry has three open files of possible police misconduct casts doubt on the veracity of this so-called bust.
