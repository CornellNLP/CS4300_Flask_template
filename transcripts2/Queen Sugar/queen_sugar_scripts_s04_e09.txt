  Put a stop to it. 
  It's out of my hands now. 
  I'm calling in that favor. 
  How will your program survive if you can't afford to plant next season? 
  I mean, it wasn't a total loss. 
  You forced people to work in a hurricane. 
  You cost two men their lives. 
  I've lost my family. 
  And I you to help Charley, Ralph Angel, and bless Nova and keep her safe. 
  Amen.

  You all right, ma'am? 
  Yeah. 
  Sure you don't want to take a break, get a coffee, clear your head from whatever's bothering you? 
  Well, clearing my head isn't... 
  Isn't exactly what I want to do. 
  Because then I'd have to think, and I don't want to think. 
  I got man problems, bill problems, kid problems, sister problems. 
  Oh, yeah, and I'm freaking running for office. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  In New Orleans? 
  No. 
  No. 
  But still, genius, right? 
  You're running for office. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  And if you leave here, if you're not careful, you're gonna see a lot of people out there who might recognize you. 
  And the later in the morning it gets, the more packed it gets.

  Miss Martha. 
  Thank you for allowing me to come. 
  I don't fool with folks unless their soul's been cleansed, which means I don't fool with folks in general too often. 
  But we're family, Nova. 
  Ah! 
  You are the spitting image of your mama. 
  And those eyes... 
  I see nothing but Lavoisier blood in those eyes. 
  - This is for you. 
  - Oh! 
  Oh! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Impepho! 
  Oh! 
  Oh, Africa's sacred herb. 
  Trudy used this in mostly used this in most of our medicinals and smudges. 
  It was a favorite of hers. 
  I had a hard time finding your place, but it all feels so familiar. 
  Well, it should. 
  I've been here before? 
  When you were about years old, you ran all over this yard wearing out your poor mama. 
  Wow. 
  I-I don't remember that... 
  at all. 
  I'm sure there are many things you don't quite remember. 
  Come on. 
  I'll make us some tea. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  What?! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Country ham, red-eye gravy, grits, scrambled eggs, fancy biscuits and that rhubarb strawberry jam you like so much. 
  You ain't got to tell me twice. 
  Yes. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  So, may I ask, what's the occasion? 
  I got something on my mind that I think I should tell you. 
  You know you can tell me anything. 
  It's about Jimmy Dale. 
  I know you was protecting me. 
  But I can't get the image of you beatin' him out of my head. 
  You went somewhere that day, and the look in your eyes, I... 
  I... 
  I scared you. 
  [SIGHS] 
  But your right, Vi, I was protecting you. 
  I know. 
  And I know that you would never hurt me. 
  But the first time I saw Jimmy Dale get violent, it wasn't with me. 
  It was with this fool of a man who was trying to talk to me in the streets. 
  That's how all this started. 
  - If somebody coming at you... 
  - No, no, I know. 
  Baby, I'm just trying to get back to us. 
  I'm trying to fix this. 
  And I know that what I'm saying right now ain't fair. 
  But I can't shake it. 
  Okay, well, how do I fix this? 
  It's not for you to fix. 
  I think I got some work I need to do on myself when it comes to Jimmy Dale. 
  I never dealt with it, and I'm learning things don't go away just because you ignore them. 
  - Morning, pops. 
  - Morning, Blue. 
  Okay, let's make a deal here. 
  No granola today, please. 
  But today's granola day. 
  Yeah, but can I just have a little bit of the sugar stars mixed in? 
  Joie has sugar stars every day. 
  That's what she tell you. 
  But I doubt her mama letting it go down like that. 
  Did you call joie's mom and set up a play date? 
  Not yet. 
  There's a lot going on. 
  - Pops. 
  - I'm gonna call today. 
  I promise. 
  Joie's all he could talk about all night. 
  If you're too busy, I can call him and set up a play date.

  Oh, Miss Deesha... 
  She's really nice, mom. 
  You'll like her. 
  There granola waiting for you inside.

  Deesha is Joie's mom. 
  You didn't tell me. 
  It's not a big deal, Darla.

  When I saw you two together... 
  Deesha knew that I was Blue's mother and your ex, but I didn't know that she's not only both your new womanbut the mother of Blue's best friend. 
  I mean, why wouldn't I want to know this? 
  You said you don't want to talk about those kind of things with each other. 
  So I didn't. 
  I know things different...

  ♪♪ NOVA: "I said a lot of things I shouldn't have said about my sister, Charley Bordelon, in my memoir, 'Blessings and Blood.' but I'm here to try to fix what I broke. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I was wrong, and I'm writing this article to set the record straight. 
  My book hurt people. 
  It diminished my sister, a woman I know see as among the strongest I've ever encountered, and I'd rather not one person pick up this book if it means hurting more people or costing the people of St. 
  Jo the best champion they could ever elect. 
  As a councilwoman, she'll protect the farmers of St. 
  Jo. 
  She'll put you first, not herself. 
  I know this because despite the unforgivable things I have done, she still allows me to call her 'sister.' she is what we all want to be... 
  Strong, wise, compassionate, a leader. 
  Most importantly, Charley Bordelon is the big little sister I want to be when I grow up."
