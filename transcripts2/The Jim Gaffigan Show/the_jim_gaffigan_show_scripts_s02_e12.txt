Good evening. The National Weather Service has just issued a tornado warning for a portion of our viewing area. [rain pattering gently outside] When you played in the yard, did you and your brothers and sisters ever fight? Well, occasionally, there would be a disagreement. You're a bundle of sticks.

Still got that six-pack of Dr Pepper I got you for your birthday? No. I drank them all that day. How much is left in that Cheez Whiz? A lot. Deal. I mean, I wish I could. Mmm... Isn't it time for little Jimmy to go to bed? Yeah, sorry. What were you saying? Where the hell is the Cheez Whiz? [Marre hums] ♪ ♪ [quietly] Gimme that! You better not eat my cereal again, or I'll beat your butt, fart-face. [continues humming] Eat the coleslaw! Mom, are we gonna get washed away by the storm?
