 [man beatboxing] 
 I am a good father! 
 Okay. 
 I'm taking all five of my kids to the Museum of Natural History tomorrow, giving up my Saturday. 
 All right. 
 Would a bad father do that? 
 No, no. Is-is Jeannie going? 
 Yeah, she is my wife. 
 Uh-huh. 
 We often spend time together with our children. 
 Okay, well, see, that doesn't count. 
 Why? 
 Because if you bring your wife, she's gonna do everything. 
 You tagging along is like her bringing six kids to the museum. 
 You don't know what you're talking about. 
 I can totally handle five kids by myself. 
 Five kids by yourself. 
 Yeah. [chuckles] 
 It's impossible. 
 [man beatboxing] 
 Jim, wake up. It's 9:00. 
 Huh? What? Uh... j-j-j... just get me when the kids are dressed and ready to go to the museum. 
 Nope, I can't. 
 My dentist appointment for Tuesday was canceled and they have to see me today. If I don't go now, they can't reschedule me till next month, and my tooth is killing me. 
 Uh, looks like we're not going to the museum, huh? 
 No, no, the kids have been looking forward to this all week. 
 That's great, honey. I love you too. 
 No, Jim, you're still taking them. 
 What? 
 Yes, Daniel is giving us those tickets to the new planetarium show. 
 Jeez, you want me to take all five kids to the museum by myself? What, are you drunk? 
 No, I just need you to get them there and I'm gonna meet you as soon as I'm done with my dentist appointment. 
 Oh, what am I thinking? You can't do this. 
 All right, let me call Blanca. 
 She'll come over, she'll help you. 
 No, don't call, Blanca. 
 Why would I need Blanca's help? I can do this by myself. 
 Just do me a favor, wake me up when the kids are dressed and ready to go to the museum. 
 No, Jim, I can't. I'm late! 
 [scoffs] 
 Fine! 
 I guess I'll get my own coffee too. I'm like a single dad. 
 Okay, just hurry up, 'cause Daniel's meeting you there in one hour. 
 An hour? What? 
 [bell dings] 
 I love you. Have so much fun. 
 Bye. Thank you. 
 Bye, Mommy. 
 (All) Bye, Mommy! 
 Daddy... 
 Daddy, I want eggs. 
 [all asking questions] 
 I want cereal. 
 I want a bagel. 
 Daddy, I want juice! 
 I want toast! 
 (All) I'm hungry! 
 All right. All right, all right, here we go.

You're not even supposed to have these, okay? These are only for VIPs, and you are barely a P. Now, if anybody asks, you found these while you were foraging in the dumpster for your lunch.

They're... they're like cousins. And this reindeer... Oh, my gosh, this is, ah, Rufus, the original reindeer. Rufus Erectus. See those big... w... wing ears? That's how he used to fly and that's how he used to trap water. They were called reindeer 'cause they used to catch all the rain on that thing, and then... they were deer, so they would make it rain. And he used to lead the sleigh back when Santa used to give people ah, rocks for Christmas that looked like toys during the Stone Age. Anyway, Rufus was, ah, in charge of the sleigh. He... he had a purple nose, 'cause he ate, ah, eggplant and other stuff, and... and then he, ah... he was in charge until that snowy night, and then Santa had Rudolph take over, which by the way, no one really liked Rudolph. And Rufus was... he went into a tailspin. Lot of smoking and drinking, which I don't want you guys to do. That's why he's so thin. I think he trampled, like, five elves, and that's why...

[muttering mockingly] Watch your children, sir. What's that, sir? Ah, I-I didn't say anything. It was... Don't sass off the nice man. Her mother. [laughs] See you, sir. Why is that guy angry at you? Because I'm better looking. And that happens. When are we going to the Planetarium show? As soon as your mom gets here. Where is mom? She'll be here soon. Uh... does anyone have to go potty? Nobody? Uh, D-Daddy has to go potty, so... Ew, the men's room! Old guys poo in there. [laughter] Stop that. We're going in. But we're girls. Uh... er... uh... James, help me out here.
