 (Door opens) 
 (Door closes) 
 Lina : Hey. 
 Working late again? 
 Russ : Uh, yeah. 
 Lina : It's kind of really late. 
 Russ : Yup, I was, uh... just working on some of my own stuff. 
 Lina : Hmm. 
 Russ : Yeah. 
 Lina : Cool. 
 Russ : Mm-hmm. 
 Um, how are you, how are the girls? 
 Lina : I spent my evening pulling sh1t out of a dog's ass. 
 Russ : Oh, for fun? 
 Russ : Or... 
 Lina : His a**l glands were compacted. 
 How was your day? 
 Russ : Like pulling sh1t out of a dog's ass. 
 Ella : Your wife is rude. 
 Russ : Tell me about it. 
 You know, she wasn't always this rude. 
 Like, before you were born, she was actually kind of cool. 
 Ella : What happened? 
 Russ : We broke her. 
 And now we are all paying for it. 
 Ella : She's refusing to get me a Halloween costume. 
 Russ : Really? 
 Ella : Really. 
 Russ : That is rude. 
 Lina : Are you freaking kidding me? 
 That's what she said, that I refused? 
 Russ : Yes. 
 Lina : First she wants to be a bee, then she wants to be a hippie, now she wants to be a pirate. 
 How many costumes am I supposed to buy? 
 Russ : So just buy her the pirate costume. 
 Lina : You buy her the pirate costume. 
 Russ : I can't, I have AJ's thing tomorrow. 
 Lina : I have lunch with Eva. 
 Russ : Eva's in town? 
 Lina : Really? 
 Russ : What? 
 Lina : I told you, like, 17 times last week that my best friend was coming to town for a week and that she has one window that she can see me for lunch and it's tomorrow and I'm gonna drive half the day to do it. 
 Russ : So, uh, what do you want to do about the pirate costume? 
 Lina : If I buy it, she won't appreciate it. 
 Lina : I should get it for her. 
 Russ : Oh, get it, don't get it... 
 I don't care. 
 Sorry. 
 (Door closes) 
 Yeah, yeah, I got AJ into this very cool facility. 
 Shepard : Very good. 
 Russ : 'Cause that guy Russ: could use a vacation. 
 Shepard : Yeah. 
 Russ : Couldn't we all? Hi. 
 Jess : Hi. Mwah. 
 Uh, you forgot to buy toilet paper again. 
 Shepard : (Soft chuckle) Well, then you forgot to remind me again. 
 Jess : Okay, well, maybe that's because one of us has a job and the other one doesn't. 
 Shepard : Okay, you know, I love when you emasculate me in front of company. 
 Jess : Okay. 
 Shepard : Do some more, Shepard: do some more. 
 Jess : No, I'm sorry for you, I really am. 
 One minute. 
 Shepard : Hmm. 
 Russ : Good times. 
 Shepard : You have any idea what time you'll be back? 
 Jess : No. 
 Jess : I have work drinks tonight. 
 Shepard : Okay, you got work drinks. 
 I got you, you got work drinks. 
 She has drinks every night and then I end up eating supper alone with the nanny. 
 Russ : Does Victoria speak English or...? 
 Shepard : You know what, I'm not really sure. 
 She seems to smile and she laughs on cue. 
 'Cause, really, what more do I need? 
 Russ : Oh, sounds fun. 
 sh1t. 
 Hey. 
 AJ : Bagels, anyone? 
 Jess : Oh, man. 
 Russ : You don't look packed. 
 AJ : Come on, come inside. 
 (Russ sighs) 
 My assistant's coming by later. She's on it. 
 Jess : No, not later. No, no, no, we don't have all day to do this. 
 Russ : Yeah, dude, come on. 
 We took off work for this. 
 AJ : Oh, man, you think they got bagels in the big house? 
 Russ : You're not going to jail. 
 Jess (Chuckling) : Jesus. 
 AJ : Oh, jail, rehab. Same sh1t. 
 Russ : Look, I know this is hard, okay? 
 But you got to get your suitcase, all right? 
 We got to go. 
 AJ : How about I go tomorrow, and the three of us just kick it today? 
 I have all these drugs... huh? 
 We should go through them so they're not here when I get back. 
 I don't need that temptation, you know? 
 Russ : We got to get this moving here, okay, so can you go get packed? Please? 
 AJ : You're a buzzkill. 
 Fine. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Russ : Hey. 
 Lina : How's it going? 
 Russ : I'm helping a grown man pack. 
 Lina : I help you pack all the time. 
 Russ : That must be why you hate me. 
 Lina : I hate you? 
 Lately it seems like you hate me. 
 Russ : What? 
 I don't... that's crazy. 
 Lina : Anyway, look, I think I want to get Ella the pirate costume. 
 Russ : I thought you said she won't appreciate it. 
 Lina : She won't, but she's almost 12, and I feel like this is the last Halloween  she'll trick-or-treat with the family. 
 Russ : Right, okay. 
 Lina : Can you do it, because by the time I get over the hill I won't have time. 
 Russ : I... 
 Sure. Sure. 
 Lina : I have to go, Eva's here. Later 
 Russ : Okay, bye. 
 (Lina laughs) 
 Eva : Oh, my gosh. 
 Lina : How are you? 
 Eva : It's good to see you. 
 Lina : You, too. 
 Eva : How's things, how's everything with Russ? 
 Lina : Well, they've been better. 
 Russ : So, what kind of work drinks do you have tonight? 
 (Jess laughs) 
 So full of sh1t. 
 Jess : I don't have work drink. 
 (Fake chuckle) 
 It's a Halloween party in the hills. 
 Russ : (Laughs) Yeah, he said you've been going out a lot lately. 
 Jess : I'm not doing anything shady, I'm just going out and having fun and dancing. 
 Shep falls asleep every night at 9:00 p.m. in front of the TV. 
 Oh, you never go out? You're so good, right, you're perfect? 
 Russ : No. 
 Jess : God, let me get a closer look at you; you are perfect. 
 Russ : I did not say that. 
 I'm in the same exact boat. Some nights I go out with the kids from the, uh, store. 
 You know, we go to the bar and I tell Lina that I'm working on my designs. 
 And the truth is I haven't worked on any of my own sh1t in months. 
 Jess : Sometimes you need to lie. 
 Russ : Yeah. 
 What is taking him so long? 
 Seriously. 
 He said he'd be right out. 
 Jess : He lied. 
 Russ : AJ, let's go. 
 (Heavy scraping) 
 (Knocking) 
 AJ. 
 Jess : Hello? 
 (Groans) 
 Russ : Oh, son of a bitch. 
 AJ! 
 Hey, come on! 
 What are you doing?! 
 Jess : We have a runner. 
 Russ : Come on! 
 I don't need this sh1t. 
 Russ : (Groans) This is so annoying. 
 I can't believe he just did this. 
 Jess : You know what, though, he's not gonna get very far without the keys. 
 Russ : That is true. 
 Jess : Yeah. 
 That was very well done on your part. 
 Jess : Yeah. You know, it's actually this trick that I used to do, like, with all of the addicts that I've dated. 
 Russ : You did date a lot of addicts. 
 Jess : Yeah, it's kind of my type. 
 Russ : I can't believe you ended up with Shep. 
 He's so straight. 
 Jess : Yeah, well, I needed someone to take the wheel. 
 Which is exactly why you and I could never be together. 
 8Russ: Yeah, we're looking for our friend to take him to rehab while we smoke a joint. 
 Jess : That's a bad... 
 (Chuckles) that's a bad couple. 
 Russ : That is a bad couple. 
 Jess : Or such a cool couple. 
 Russ : Is that him? 
 That's him right there. Pull over. 
 Pull over right here. 
 AJ : I just wanted to say good-bye to my favorite barista. 
 Jess : Yeah. 
 No, he's really gonna miss you. 
 AJ : I tip really well. 
 He is really gonna miss me. 
 Russ : Just get in the car. 
 AJ : Let my guy make you a mocha. 
 Jess : No. 
 Russ : Just get in the car. 
 AJ : Let my guy make you a mocha, Come on. 
 Jess : Nobody wants a mocha. 
 AJ : Fine. Fine. 
 Jess : Nobody wants a mocha. 
 AJ : Fine. It's your loss. He makes the best mocha. 
 Jess : Okay. 
 Lina : We're not connecting anymore, you know? 
 And by the end of the day, when we finally all... 
 Eva : Oh, my God. like... 
 Lina, I am so sorry. 
 I just have to have a quick cup of coffee with Parker here. 
 Look, it'll just... it'll... it'll take a couple minutes. 
 Lina : Oh. 
 Parker : Sorry to interrupt. 
 Lina : Okay... Sure. 
 Do you want me to move? 
 
 
 
 AJ : What the hell is this? Am I rehabbing at a Dollar Store? 
 Russ : No, I just got to do some shopping. I got to get Ella a pirate costume. 
 AJ : Guys, maybe rehab isn't the answer for me. 
 Russ : Dude. 
 Jess : You're going to rehab. 
 AJ : Do I have a private room? 
 Russ : Yes. 
 AJ : Do I have a private bathroom? 
 Russ : Yes. 
 AJ : I wonder if I get a bidet 'cause I like to be clean. 
 Jess : (Groans) No. 
 All right, well, what size pirate is she? 
 Russ : Uh, I don't have any idea. 
 She's almost 12, so... 
 Jess : She is? 
 Russ : Yeah. 
 Jess : God. 
 Russ : I know. 
 I think this is the last year that she's gonna trick-or-treat with us. 
 Jess : Oh. 
 Did she have her period yet? 
 Russ : No, don't, okay? 
 I don't know. The doctor said it could be any minute. 
 Jess : Ooh, you're gonna get those boobs and pubes in your house. 
 Russ : Stop it, okay? 
 I can't even get my head around that. 
 Jess : Here we go. Look. 
 You're done. Pirate. 
 Russ : What is that? 
 Jess : And you're welcome. 
 It's a pirate costume. 
 Russ : No, it's a sexy pirate. 
 AJ : It's a slutty pirate. 
 Russ : I just said she's 12. 
 That's way too much, Jess. 
 AJ : That's a dirty, dirty pirate. 
 Jess : I'm sorry, but this is L.A. 
 This is what kids wear. 
 AJ : A pirate that dresses like that has daddy issues. 
 Russ : Yeah. Why are there no classy pirate costumes here? 
 She's just gonna have to be the bee or the hippie, I guess. 
 AJ : I just had a thought. 
 What if Caitlin grows up to be a slutty pirate? 
 What if I'm one of these whore-making dads? 
 Russ : No. You're... 
 You're a good dad, okay? 
 She's gonna be fine. 
 AJ : Right. 
 That's why I got to stay home and I got to take care of my kid, 'cause I'm a good dad. 
 Jess : No. 
 Russ : No, that's not what I said. 
 You're gonna go to rehab so that you can become a better dad. 
 AJ : Right. A better dad. 
 Jess : Yeah. 
 AJ : Rehab. 
 We just got to make a quick stop at my office first, though. 
 (Jess groans) 
 Russ : What? 
 All right. 
 You get five minutes, all right? That's it. I'm serious. 
 AJ : All right, all right. 
 Relax, Dad. 
 I just have to go upstairs and say good-bye to my work family and pick up some socks. 
 (Tapping) 
 AJ : Hey, Gillian. 
 Gillian : Hi. 
 (Pills rattling) 
 AJ : Ah, they sound comfy. 
 Gillian : Just like you ordered. 
 AJ : Yeah. 
 Gillian : The guy I got them from said not to wear the socks on an empty stomach. 
 AJ : Hey, got to always listen to the sock man, right? 
 Gillian : Just be careful. 
 AJ : Hey, uh, where is everybody? 
 Richard and Abby are... 
 They're not in their offices. 
 Gillian : Um, they are in the partner meeting. 
 AJ : Partner meeting? 
 Gillian : Mm-hmm. 
 AJ : But I'm one of the partners. 
 Gillian : I know. It's just... 
 AJ : So how can they have a partner meeting without me, if I'm one of the partners? 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 Gillian : Well, you weren't coming in today. 
 AJ : So I'm not one of the partners anymore, huh? 
 Gillian : No, of course you are. 
 AJ : Oh, oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. 
 No, you're right! You're right! 
 I'm a founding partner! 
 (Whistling) 
 Gillian : You know, I really don't think this is such a good idea. 
 Why don't we just go to lunch or something. 
 AJ? 
 Good luck. 
 AJ : Hey, guys. 
 How's it going? 
 Hey, uh, I got a little something I want to say to you. 
 (Muffled): Are you insane?! Are you out of your minds?! 
 This... mine, mine, this is all mine! 
 I started this company! 
 (Speaking indistinctly) 
 ...on your skulls after I remove your brains! 
 (Eva speaking indistinctly) 
 Lina : Um, you know what, I think, uh... I think I'm gonna get going. 
 I'll just see you next time you're in town. 
 Eva : Lina, just hang on one s... 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Uh, I have to get this. 
 Lina : Sure. 
 Eva : Can you just hang on one second? 
 Lina : No, it's fine, it's fine. It was nice to meet you. 
 Good luck with your, um, important meeting. 
 Eva : (Sighs) Hey. I am so sorry. 
 Look, I'm only in town for a couple days and I overbooked. 
 Are you okay? 
 Lina : (Sniffles) No. 
 Eva : Should we go get a drink? 
 Lina : I just gave the guy my ticket. 
 Eva : I'll take care of it. Come on. 
 Gillian : Everything's fine. I shouldn't have called you guys, uh... I just got scared. 
 Jess : Why, what happened? 
 Gillian : The partners had AJ escorted out of the building. 
 After everything that he's done for them, it's so ungrateful. 
 Right? 
 Russ : What did he do? 
 Gillian : Nobody got hurt. 
 AJ got a tiny bit violent. 
 Jess : Uh-huh. 
 Gillian : But he wanted me to tell you guys that rehab can wait, because things are a little intense right now with the new firm. 
 Jess : The new firm? 
 Gillian : We're starting a new firm. 
 I mean, AJ is, but I'm helping him. 
 Jess : Oh, I'm sure you are, sweetie. 
 That's great. 
 Gillian : N-No, you guys, now's really not a good time. 
 Wait, you guys, um, sorry... 
 AJ? 
 Russ : Let's go. 
 It's time to go. Time to go. 
 AJ : Gillian, did you explain to them how busy I am with the new firm? 
 Gillian : I tried. 
 Russ : Oh, cut the crap. 
 There is no new firm, okay? 
 You're going to rehab like you promised. 
 AJ : Do you have that promise in writing? 
 Russ : In a text. 
 AJ : Well, texts are inadmissible. 
 You know, anybody can hack that sh1t, right? 
 Jess : Oh, my God, you're such an asshole. 
 We've been chasing you around all day, okay? 
 Russ : You know what, don't worry about it. 
 I don't care anymore. 
 I really don't. I'm over it. 
 Okay, you don't want to go to rehab? 
 Don't go, okay? 
 Who cares that I spent the week yelping different facilities, okay? 
 Reading reviews of food and-and fitness centers. 
 If you want to screw me over and Jess and this poor girl who's probably in love with you, go for it. 
 AJ : Right. Come on, she's not in love with me. 
 Gillian : But you said you wanted to be with me. 
 AJ : Yeah. At the new firm. 
 Gillian : But what about when we... 
 AJ : Oh, my God, did we have s*x? 
 Gillian : Twice. 
 AJ : Did you like it? 
 Gillian : Once. 
 Jess : Oh, wow. 
 AJ : Well. 
 I guess it's, uh... it's time for somebody to go to rehab, huh? 
 Lina : No, I just really wanted to talk to you because I can't talk to the other moms about real stuff. 
 Eva : Okay, well, what's going on with you and Russ? 
 Lina : He hates his job. 
 He comes home super late every night and I can tell that he doesn't want to be around me. 
 I don't understand it. 
 Eva : Do you know, sometimes when I come home at night, I am such a bitch to Karen. 
 Lina : Okay, but why? 
 Eva : I don't know. 
 I mean, she's taking care of my kids, she's washing my clothes. 
 Lina : Yeah. 
 Eva : But sometimes I look at her and I can't stand her. 
 Like, all the sacrifices that she's made for me, I just, I see them on her face. 
 It makes me want to slap the sh1t out of her. 
 Lina : Really? 
 (Eva laughs) 
 I can tell when I walk through the door. 
 He looks at me like he wants me to be his cheerleader or something. 
 Eva : You know what? 
 He probably just wants you to put his dick in your mouth. 
 (Laughs) 
 Lina : I'm a terrible wife. 
 Eva : Hey, stay in the hotel room with me tonight, come on. 
 I have an early meeting, but you can just hang out, get a massage, charge it to the room. 
 And then we can really hang out later. 
 Lina : Yeah, screw it, Russ can take 'em trick-or-treating. 
 Eva : Mm-hmm. 
 Lina : They don't even care about me. 
 (Eva laughs) 
 They probably won't even notice if I'm not there. 
 Eva : So you'll stay? 
 Lina : Happy Halloween. 
 Russ : Hey. 
 Russ : What are you doing here? 
 Lina : Hi, guys. 
 I thought you were, uh, spending the night at Eva's. 
 Lina : Oh, I didn't really think you could handle trick-or-treating on your own. 
 But I was clearly wrong. 
 Russ : Clearly. 
 Lina : You got the pirate costume. 
 Not bad. 
 Ella : Hey, guys, Hannah just texted and asked if I could go trick-or-treating with them. 
 Can I? 
 All my friends are gonna be there. 
 Please. 
 Russ : Uh, sure. 
 Ella : Really? 
 Lina : I hope she bleeds right through that pirate costume tonight. 
 Russ : Yeah. 
 Let Hannah's mother find her a tampon. 
 Lina : And show her how to use it. 
 Maya : What's a tampon? 
 Russ : Uh... 
 It's kind of like a sponge... that soaks up stuff. 
 Maya : What stuff? 
 Frankie : Are we done talking about tampons? 
 Lina : How are we gonna trick-or-treat when the kids are too old? 
 Russ : We won't. 
 Lina : Well, what will we do? 
 Russ : We'll give out candy. 
 Lina : We're gonna be those old people giving out candy? 
 That's depressing. 
 Frankie : Look what we've got! 
 Lina : Oh, I want a butterfinger. 
 Maya : Mom. 
 Russ : Give your mother a butterfinger... she does a lot of sh1t for you. 
 Now. 
 Give it. 
 All right, let's keep going. 
 Come on. 
 Russ : Get something bigger. 
 Frankie : We will, Daddy. 
 Russ : King size. 
 What was that for? 
 Lina : Standing up for me. 
 Russ : Hmm. 
 Well, in that case... 
 Feeling more than just a kiss. 
 (Lina laughs) 
 (Horn honks) 
 Jess : Am I too late? 
 Shepard : Just in time. 
 Ooh, you know what? 
 Back in the car. 
 Jess : What? 
 Shepard : Just wait in the car. 
 Some neighbors don't hate us yet. 
 Jess : I look good. 
 Shepard : Yes, you do.
