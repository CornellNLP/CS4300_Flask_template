 Ghost :  Previously on  Power. 
 Ghost ain't here. 
 He don't exist! 
 Tommy :  I'm number one now. I'm gonna get you the best product at the best price. 
 Cooper :  Lobos was stabbed in custody. And everything we ever wanted can happen now. 
 What's our new hustle? 
 The club is the new hustle. 
 Shipment was light. 
 The other primeras might get pissed. 
 Can you think of a reason why Lobos wouldn't send the full amount? 
 We have to make it look like you're dead. 
 If your money's moving, it means you're alive to move it. 
 Felipe Lobos is alive. 
 What? 
 He survived the attack in prison. 
 Tommy, we need to talk, man. 
 Tomas, did you forget our deal? 
 Ghost needs to be dead soon. Otherwise... 
 Holly?

♪ But you hang around of the edge ♪ What is so important that we couldn't discuss on the phone? I need you to get a message to our friend Lobos. Word on the street is Lobos died from gettin' stabbed in the slammer. I heard he got stabbed. I didn't hear he actually kicked though. Mmm, you looking for confirmation? I'm looking for a location. Have a seat. You want a drink? No, I'm good. I need to know where he is. I know you got connections, Proctor, and I know you can use those connections to get me what I need. Yes, I can, but the question is whether I should. See, you asking means you already know more than I do. You're not exposed right now. Keep it that way. Yeah, but when this is all over, I'm done for good. I no longer need you. I just got to make sure it's over. You know, it's too bad you can't ask your ex-girlfriend the prosecutor, 'cause she would know where to find him. Actually, Angela and I are still together. Oh, man. You got to teach me whatever it is you know about women, because she should hate your breathing guts by now. And she would if I keep going to her for information. That's why I need you. I think we could actually be successful with this John Doe prosecution of Lobos even without a witness against him, but there's no way we can do it without bringing in the files from Texas and California. I don't know, Angela. Involving the other states could open us up to forum shopping for Kessler. He could request a change of venue. We make the argument that he was arrested here. We have the strongest case. I want to review the files from the other jurisdictions and talk to their agents. Why don't I get those files for you? The request can be filled faster if I make it, especially by my former office. Great. [door opens] [door closes] Saxe, what's up? Was that, uh, Angela? What did she want that she had to come to you on the sly, she couldn't share with the group, huh? Why are you here? You don't seem to be sharing with the group. [scoffs] I had an idea. We told Judge Cross that we would solve the attempt on Lobos's life. Maybe we should. Yeah, I said that, but there's nothing to solve. We know it was the Jimenez. The identity of the hitter doesn't really matter since he's clearly already incarcerated. But if we prove it was the Jimenez, we can potentially add that murder to the list of charges when we eventually bring Diego Jimenez to trial, right? Got to land the big whale sometime. Do I have your blessing? Yeah, go for it, but I doubt you'll find the guy. It's probably a waste of your time. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [buttons clicking] [horn honks in distance] Tommy, we need to talk, man. It's Ghost. ♪ ♪ Who was on the phone? They had the wrong number. Flyers look good. I bet we get a call, find Bell. I just hope she's not hurt. Look, Holl, if we don't find her, I promise I'll get you another one. You can't just replace Bell. That's like saying if you died, I'm just gonna go out and f*ck another guy right away. Jesus, Holly, that's a fucked-up thing to say. That's my point. Look, I want Bell just like I only want you. I want Bell, and I'm not gonna be able to sleep until we find her. I'm sure we'll find her. [engine starts] Thanks for letting me take the kids to Angela's. I didn't do it for you. You know, when my dad left, I hardly saw him at all. They deserve better. Why are you really here? I need you to get this check to Tommy. Wow. You sure we can afford this now that you only have club money coming in? It's not our money, Tasha. It's Tommy's. Closed the Laundromats, all the original Truth accounts. It's his half of everything, all the businesses. After Tommy gets this check, we're officially closed for business. I'm out. We are not partners anymore. Why don't you tell him that yourself? Because he won't return my calls, okay? He don't want to see me. Well, he doesn't want to see me. Looks like I'm collateral damage in whatever happened between y'all. Can you just reach out to Tommy for me? Today? Julio : Did you hear from Lobos about why we keep getting half the motherfucking weight? Tommy : Look, Lobos is stuck in the joint, and we selling the story that he dead in the streets, so m*therf*cker got problems, all right? Probably had to scale down his moves for a minute while he plays dead, so slow your roll, man. All right. What am I gonna tell our new primera friends when we can't deliver the amount of f*ckin' weight we promised them, Tommy? Yo, maybe we should step on the product, cut it up, right? Make everybody f*cking happy. We ain't doing that. Why not? The move is short-minded, man. I'm not gonna compromise the product. That would ruin my name in the street. Change of management doesn't mean change in product. Then what we gonna do? I don't know. Why don't you f*cking let me think? [knocking] [knocking] [scoffs] How long have you been back in town? Long enough to know that you're not welcome here. Look, Tommy doesn't want to talk to you or Ghost. I think he'll change his mind when we talk about money. Not so fast. Your name ain't on this check. How much is that for? You'll find out when you tell Tommy to come see me. He knows my number. We both work for Lobos. We're on the same side. I'm looking for your help here. If we knew the name of the man who stabbed Lobos, he'd already be dead. Well, he's not, and if somebody else finds him before we do, Lobos could have a problem. We let everyone believe it's the Jimenez so there aren't any loose ends, but if the hitter fingers Ghost, then Ghost can turn witness and testify against Lobos. Trust me, if that happens, No, no, no, no... [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Lakeisha : f*ck that. My kids are not spending the night over at no side piece's house, ever. That bitch is a drive-by. She ain't a drive-by. He parked. And if I act badly, the kids are the only ones who suffer. You're being way too nice. I'm being an adult, Keisha. Trust me, if it wasn't for them kids, I'd throw the bitch down the stairs. You the right amount of wrong, or you could punch that bitch in the throat with that big-ass ring of... Tasha, where your ring at? Do not tell me he asked you to give that sh1t back. He wouldn't try it. It's worth more to me gone. You sold it? You that pressed? I'm not pressed for money, not yet. I'm just... I'm over it, Keisha. I'm not playing make-believe with Ghost anymore. The Ghost I knew is gone. Well, look, if you ever need some extra cash, you could always do the books around here for me. I know you always got my back, girl, and I appreciate that, but I'm good. I'll let you know, though, if anything changes. I might need you. All right, well, I'ma go finish this weave real quick. Yeah, help her out. [laughs] Stop. [hair dryer hums] [dance music] [crowd whooping] Dominique : Got some big spenders over there, four bottles of Effen, and it's still early. My kind of people. Hey, here they are. I'm James St. Patrick, the club owner. Oh! [laughs] Hey, bae, hold my piece. Andy. Andy. This is Alby. Hey, Alby, pleasure. Hey, great place you got here, bro. Thanks, man. You know, we... we try. Well, we love it, don't we, And? Andy : Love it. Yeah, we'll be back. Creatures of habit, we are. All right, well, you know what? You should make a habit of coming to Verbatim, my new spot. New? Yeah, I thought that was a Stern place. Used to be. Now it's mine. You know DJ Taj, right? DJ Taj? He's the sh1t. Well, he'll be spinning at the re-launch party, so you should come through. Yeah, honestly, mate, Verbatim, it's kind of tired, but if, uh, Taj is there, I'll swing by. Sounds good. I'll comp you. Make sure you bring all these beautiful ladies too, okay? Sounds... sounds good. Sounds good. Hey, so cool of you, bro. No problem. How about I swing by a new bottle? That'll be on me. That's very good. All right. I'll be right back with two VIP invites. Don't shoot too many people with that. [laughter] [muffled dance music in background] What's up, Andre? Look, man, I came to work for you to help you out, but you keeping me out the loop, man. What's up with that card in that desk, the one with the blood all over it? What's up with you looking in my desk? The funny thing is I was looking for a goddamn tie, but that's not the f*cking point. I've seen that card before. When I was inside, m*therf*cker stuck this Puerto Rican nigga and left a card just like that on top of him while he bled the f*ck out. I heard it was some Mexican Mafia sh1t or something. [speaking softly] It's not the Mexican Mafia. Well, whatever it is, you get a card like that, it means you're in trouble. It means we're in trouble. Is that why you want me strapped? Ghost, listen to me. What you want me to do? It'll get done, man. ♪ ♪ I want you to go back downstairs. I want you to get back to work. [huffs] And if I need help, I'll ask you for that. ♪ ♪ No, you won't, man. ♪ ♪ [door opens] [door shuts] Tasha : Thank you. And you, sir? Nothing for me, thanks. Hmm, that's a first. Not like you to pass up a meal. I mean, you love the pancakes here. Just give me my money so I can get the f*ck out of here already. What is going on with you? I mean, I know you and Ghost got beef, but that ain't got sh1t to do with me. Oh, I don't know. Maybe I had a little chat with Kanan before he kicked. He had a pretty f*cking interesting theory about how we got set up in the first place. You want to hear it? Little story about a broken taillight and an anonymous tip from a woman? Look, Tommy, I don't know what Kanan... Don't even try to f*cking lie to me. Ghost already copped to the two of you setting him up. Just eat your goddamn pancakes. Okay, you want to talk about lying? How long was Ghost f*cking Miss Puerto Rico before you told me, hmm? Oh, wait, you never did. You lied to me about Kanan for ten years like I was a f*cking chump. Tommy, we couldn't tell you, okay? I mean, the fewer people who knew about Kanan the better. We had to do what was best for you, for everyone. Best for me? Oh, maybe that's why Ghost started f*cking Angela. He was just doing what was best for you. ♪ ♪ Wow. It's like that? Take your f*cking money, Tommy. The truth is, in both our cases, Ghost had us doing what was best for him. ♪ ♪ Taj :  I need security at my booth. I hate being bothered and people making requests... so dodgy. And I need the DJ booth moved to the center of the dance floor. The DJ booth is up there to the left. That's very nice for you, but I need to be at the center of the event so I can control the crowd. All right, I'll try to get it done. There's no trying involved, is there? Get the DJ booth moved to the center of the dance floor or I can't perform here. The legendary DJ Taj. It's great to meet you, man. We're so excited for you to join us. He doesn't shake hands. I really don't. I see. [whispering] You see this sh1t? I was just saying to your employee I will be needing the DJ booth moved to the center of the dance floor because... No need to explain. Consider it done. Get someone on it right way, all right? Cheers. I'll see you at sound check. See you then. [makes kiss sound] This m*therf*cker wants a fresh quart of orange juice delivered to him every 30 minutes. He think he Beyonce or something? You know what, man? He's gonna make us a lot of f*cking money. He's the hottest DJ in EDM right now, all right? He's got a huge following, and you can't show him a gun and expect him to do what you want him to do. Come on, Andre, it don't work that way. It's a club, man. f*ck him. Sometimes you have to do what you got to do. Speaking the f*ck of which, I need to get him to sign these damn contracts. [phone vibrates] [clears throat] [suspenseful music] Can you handle the contracts? Something just came up. What's up? Oh, I get it. It's none of my business, right? Just put the booth where he wants it and get the contracts signed. [sucks tongue] [slow electronic music] Yo, man, my dad's pissed you skimped on our sh1t. This order's half of what you promised. That's why I'm only taking half the money. Now, what's the problem? Problem is not enough for profit. We run out too quickly. With no drugs, we cannot hold territory. I understand why you're mad. You want more drugs. I want more money. If I had more drugs, I would gladly take more of your money, but I don't. The problem will be resolved quickly, I promise. Your promise is worth sh1t! Hey. We should go back to our old connect. Tommy : I can't make you buy my drugs, but it's gonna take you a long time to find another connect that will hook you up with this quality. Time is money. Now, you want to waste money, or you want to get this sh1t on the street? We made a deal. I have made promises because of our deal. I understand that, but I ran into problems that I couldn't have predicted, and because of that... This kind of sh1t makes us look bad on the streets, homie. Uh-oh. [ominous music] The circumstances were out of my hands, but that will be remedied soon. ♪ ♪ Next shipment, which will be sooner than normal, I'll throw in a couple of keys on the house to make up for this... inconvenience. How's that sound? We all have setbacks. It is how we move forward that is important. Word up. Domo arigato. Yo, that's Japanese, son. Do you even know how offensive that sh1t is? It is the effort that counts. [glass clinking] Stay for dinner, please. Enjoy some of our services on the house. I got a lady and a pizza at home, but I appreciate the offer. Hey, hey, hey. Bro, you might be happily married, but I ain't got no girl at home. Slow your roll, tiger. There'll be time for that. We got work to do. Shin, Dylan, pleasure doing business with you. [giggles] Oh, sh1t. What up, Dre? The f*ck you been hiding? sh1t, just grinding, trying to get this paper, man. [overlapping greetings] You don't look like you on no grind. You look like you about to go to court. [laughter] You got a bail hearing, B? Nah, m*therf*cker, I run three nightclubs, so I got to dress like a goddamn citizen, man. sh1t, what I miss? You ain't missing sh1t. Same old, except remember Tru, that nigga from down south? Hmm. He got clipped last week. No reason... just wrong place, wrong time. Niggas be out here wilding for real. Speaking of which, I ain't see your boy Kanan in a minute. sh1t, ain't no telling where he at, bro. Just thought maybe he went corporate too. [huffs] Might see you niggas on "Shark Tank" and sh1t. [laughter] Whatever, man. Yo, them clubs be raking in that dough... [sucks air] Or you wouldn't f*ck with it. [exhales] I know you, nigga. You a grimy street cat like me. We need to hit they ass for a lick. People buy drinks with cash over there, right? Got to be a lot of loot up in that spot. Nah, ain't the move, bro. sh1t, this nigga's gone soft overnight. f*ck nah, man. I'm just saying I just started working over there, so I don't know the ins and outs of everything. What I do know is they got security cameras and ex-militia watching that front door. I ain't getting sent back upstate for nobody, especially your black ass. Proctor : Bad news is, couldn't get a location on Lobos. How hard you try? I'm not a goddamn magician. He's not in the system anymore. You know what is in the system? Death certificate. You absolutely sure Lobos is still alive? Yes. Someone's going to a lot of trouble to make it look the other way. Most likely he's in witness protection, and you're f*cked 'cause he's halfway to Arizona by now. Lobos wouldn't snitch. Not his style. [sighs] Multiple stab wounds in the belly... that could change a man's style. If you're right, I can only think of one other option. It's called a John Doe prosecution. New York feds have a history with these cases. Lobos will be tried in a closed court. No one knows his real name. It only gets approved when the identity of the defendant is dangerous information in itself. The person's life has to be under credible threat. So the attempt on his life... Yup, probably caused the U.S. Attorney to go John Doe to keep him safe. If this is a John Doe situation, you got a better chance of finding Jimmy Hoffa. I see. Does Lobos know you tried to kill him? I never said I tried to kill him. Oh, cut the sh1t. I'm your attorney here, and I need to know if you're in real danger. Do you think Lobos is gonna make a move on you? I don't know. Well, if you don't know, then you can't watch your back. You need to ask Angela how to find Lobos so you could close the issue. I can't do that. You may have to decide between protecting your girl or saving your own life. I know which one I would choose. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ What's up, baby? You drunk already? [chuckles] We didn't get one call about Bell, not one. Give it some time. Those flyers only been up for a minute. I don't think we're gonna find her. I think she's dead. I brought you home some big bucks. [Tommy chuckles] That might make you happy. Holy sh1t. Can't believe we have so much money. [laughs] Yeah. It's legit. Well, it will be when I put it in the bank, but I got a ton of sh1t to do, so... I got nothing to do tomorrow. I'll handle that thing for you. Whoa, Holly, Holly, I'll handle it. Oh, come on, baby, you want to handle something? Handle this. Yeah. Yeah, you like that? f*ck, yeah. [zipper slides] [speaking softly] Oh, yeah, I do. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, you read my mind. Come on, baby, come on. Oh, f*ck, yeah. Julito, tell Tommy to call me back. sh1t's going down he needs to f*cking know about. Do whatever you got to do to get him to hit me back.

Well, he went with a higher bidder. Andre never made him sign the contract. I want to see Andre right away, and get a replacement DJ for tonight. Okay, I'm on it. Who owns the club across the street?

Look, man, I'm sorry I f*cked up. I got a DJ coming tonight. He's from my hood. He's on his way right now. Yeah? You know what? Maybe next time we can get the f*cking dude who runs the bodega on the corner to spin. Dude, I'm hustling, man. No, your head ain't in the game. You weren't so concerned about my business, maybe you wouldn't have made this damn mistake. He left right after sound check. I thought I had time to do it before he went on tonight. Look, I don't know this sh1t. I'm a hustler. I... I know the streets. If you want sh1t done a certain way, then maybe you should do it yourself, bro. [sighs] Look, I'm on your team, man. I'm mad too. Look, they right there. We can go f*ck them bitch-ass niggas up right now. It'd make me feel better. So you just gonna let them punk you like that? You know what? Sometimes no response is the best response, so we not gonna make a move, not right now, Andre. They'd be expecting it. We'll let them wait in fear. We make a plan, and then we attack. [ominous music] [knocking] [clattering] Tasha, come in. It takes a while to get used to the childproof doorknobs. Jamie didn't mention you were... I didn't tell Ghost I was stopping by.

Read her a book. Give her a sippy cup with warm organic milk, 2%. She won't drink anything else. Whole is too creamy. Skim isn't creamy enough. It's a whole thing. Angela : I... I covered all the electrical outlets and got latches on the cabinets. You still need corner guards for the coffee table, and keep all sharp objects out of Yasmine's reach, mm-kay? Your eye level or higher. Absolutely. Other than that, the place looks good. Smaller than I pictured. Uh, where are Tariq and Raina gonna sleep? Are their bedrooms this way? It's just our room in there. Jamie said the kids would be okay on the floor with sleeping bags. If that doesn't work for you... No, it's fine. They'll be fine. I think we've covered it, so... Tasha?

And which account did you want to deposit it in, the personal checking or the LLC?

I thought maybe you could teach me how to move the money around. Then I could do it. How did you set this all up? I don't know. Tasha did all that for me. Tasha knows how to do this? I thought her banking skills were strictly withdrawal only. Nah, T's real smart about this kind of sh1t. She studied f*cking accounting. She almost got her diploma and everything. Almost? She married Ghost and quit school. Look, I know Tasha's a bitch, but maybe we should bring her in on this. She can teach me how to handle the money. No, no way. I don't want nothing to do with those people. You just said it. She's smart. You and Ghost never got nabbed by the IRS, right? Look, since Ghost closed down the Laundromats, we're gonna need to figure out another way to handle the money. Baby, I'm gonna f*ck this up if I do it on my own. We use Tasha till I learn the ropes, and then we get rid of her. [phone buzzes] I gotta go. But we'll figure this out together, okay? Okay. But together. Together. I was thinking about something.

The evidence of the murders the Jimenez ordered against Lobos's New York Syndicate? Vladimir and Drifty and the attempt on Lobos himself, huh? The La Araña cards, the crime scene photos, witness statements... it's all been farmed back out to the NYPD, to the individual precincts. It'll take months to get that back. It's all gone, and oops, no one signed the orders to return it to the locals. Well, that's just the kind of sloppy thing you would do. Okay, I know you don't trust me, Saxe.
