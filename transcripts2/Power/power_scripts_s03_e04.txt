 Ghost : Previously on  Power... 
 I'll be all right when I get back on my feet. 
 Pass me them pills. 
 So you told Jukebox to move to D.C. and accept who she really is? 
 It's probably why she looks up to you so much. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Dirt : You killed two people right in front of me. 
 I think I should walk away. 
 We're talking about one job here. 
 Well, whatever you got going, I want in on it. 
 Tommy : The drugs we gave you have been stepped on. 
 I need you to right this wrong. 
 [Yells] 
 Ghost : I had a meeting with Karen Bassett. 
 She's interested in putting one of my clubs in a new space she's opening. 
 I know you can run a club, but who is James St. Patrick? 
 The only other person who could confirm that St. Patrick is the distributor is Vibora Ruiz. 
 I was hoping maybe you could use some of your DEA contacts,  help me find him. 
 All right. 
 They're saying Tariq brought a gun to school. 
 The gun is registered to an Angela Valdes. 
 My kids won't be staying at that bitch's house again. 
 Tasha. 
 I'm glad you two are getting along so well together. 
 We're getting sh1t set up. 
 Holly : I want to know what you are doing about Ghost. 
 Lobos killed our dog, Tommy. 
 Next time it's gonna be you or me. 
 Nothing's gonna happen to us.

I can take him, but I'm gonna need you to pick him up. Can't tomorrow. Got a big meeting about the club that I can't reschedule. Tariq needs to know that he's a priority in your life. Providing for you and the kids is a priority, which is why I can't miss the meeting. The kids appreciate all that you do for them,  but you need to show your face around here every once in a while. And if they can't come here, how am I supposed to see them? You can see them any time you want as long as it ain't at Angela's. I don't need Raina coming home with a f*cking switchblade.

Just might make things a little easier, you know? Last time we outsourced to the Jamaicans, sh1t didn't go over well. Besides, Lobos told me to do it. Then I guess you better do it.

Well, that's good to hear. Thank you for all your hard work. Uh, you and your guys have been rock solid, all right? And I appreciate you having my back. Usually when someone hires personal security, it's to thwart a specific threat. Is there a person we should anticipate? If it's predictable, it's preventable. Club business... is simply competitive. When you have something that everybody wants, it's easy to create enemies. The cost of having it all, right? No doubt. Well, how do you want to proceed with your personal detail, Mr. St. Patrick? I'd like you guys to stay on me a while longer. Just to be safe. Right. Just to be safe. [Ominous music] ♪ ♪ [chuckles] ♪ ♪ Is he in jail? No. Is he dead? No, Tasha, Jamie is fine.

This is my fault. It was the least I could do. Yeah. The least. But you know you didn't do it for Tariq. Sure as hell didn't do it for me. You did this for Ghost.

It won't happen again. ♪ ♪ [groans] Good. ♪ ♪ You did me a solid, man. Those aliases you gave me on Vibora Ruiz paid off. He's in San Diego. I'm flying out tonight. Nice. You need DEA backup on this thing? Should I call my guys, have them meet you on-site, lend a hand? No, thanks. Already coordinated with San Diego PD, so... Cool. Well, sh1t, Knox. I smell a promotion. [laughs] And unlike Angela, you've done it without sucking anyone's dick. She didn't suck Mike's dick to get on the task force. DOJ drafted a deal. If Ruiz takes it, finally have a witness to testify against Lobos. But Lobos is dead. Right. I meant testify against Tommy Egan and James St. Patrick. Ruiz, he can name the whole network. It's really too bad Lobos got got 'cause Ruiz would've been a direct witness against him. When I was working UC, I saw him talking to Lobos with my own f*cking eyes. He would've cracked the case wide open. Yeah. Oh, sh1t, I got to go. You let me know how it all plays out. You call me if you need anything, and you get it all by the book. I don't want to see any of these M*therf*ckers walking on techs. Come on. You know it. Thanks a lot. Good luck, bro. All right. [Sighs] [Sighs] Sorry I'm late. Mmm, smells delicious. What are you making? You went to see Tasha? What the hell were you thinking? After hearing your conversation this morning and knowing how much you miss the kids, it seemed like the right thing to do. I had good intentions. I appreciate you taking care of Tariq's record, but you should ask me before you go over there. I don't need to ask for your permission, Jamie. Oh, yes, you do. Especially when it comes to my wife. You know what I mean. No, I don't think I do. [Doorbell rings] You gonna get the door? Paz! Entrar. Angelita, it's so good to see you. You too. How are you? Good. You look pretty. You remember Jamie. Mm-hmm. Qué pasa, Paz? Uh, good. Can I get you some wine? Uh, okay. So it's been a long time. Quite a long time. Para ti. Paz : Gracias. Jamie, how nice of you to pay the rent. Angela's always paid for her own things. Never depended on a man before. Jamie, why would you do that? I had good intentions. So what's the problem? Isn't dinner ready? Let's eat. So what does that mean? Tasha : It means you won't have a record. It means Angela made the whole thing go away. Dad made her do that for me? Something like that. Look, 'Riq, our family's not like other families. Not like other families at school. Ma, I know. You tell me this all the time. We have to do better and be better than the kids at school.

Angela, I remember back in the day when you got grounded for sneaking out to meet Jamie. Papi was pissed! You remember that? He was chasing me down the street. Told me to never come back, but I couldn't stay away. Are you in contact with anyone from the old neighborhood? What ever happened to that mamao, Tommy Egan? Ghost : He and I lost touch. But enough about the past. How's your son? How's he doing? Paz : Junior's great. Finishing school, looking for a job. Congratulations. That's super cool. Paz : What about your kids? How'd they take the news about your divorce? Ah. You're not divorced yet. He's working on it. Sure. I'll be right back. You okay, Ange? I'm fine. So, Paz, of course, you know, the job market is tough right now, but I have, uh, an opening at a club if Junior was interested. Thanks, I appreciate it, but I wouldn't want to put my son in a awkward situation. What do you mean? Well, you know.

Occupied by four white males headed northeast on Jefferson Ave. [Ominous music] Angela. The California case files finally came through, and I think I have a break in the case. What do you got? I found the wife of one of the victims from your safe-house murders. Her husband was making 50 grand on a U.S. Marshal salary, but now his widow is living the high life in a mansion in La Jolla. That doesn't track. It's possible the marshal had a good life insurance policy given his high-risk profession. Or maybe someone's taking care of her with hush money. She might know something. I've left her a message to set a call. Let me know when you hear back from her. [Phone beeps] Since your DJ Taj fuck-up, I notice you been hustling extra hard in the clubs. Attending this meeting is your reward. Just sit back, listen, learn. That street sh1t is second nature to you, Andre. We got to get it where this hustle is too. Especially if you still considering doing both. Look man, I know I wasn't getting it all at first, but, on the real, sh1t's been hard having one foot in the hood and one foot out. Nothing tougher than shedding that old skin, having to leave behind those that ain't willing to grow with you. There she is. James. Andre, meet the lovely Karen Bassett. Karen, this is Andre.

Speaking of which, you know how excited I am to talk about the potential expansion of my brand into your new hotel. I am too, but there's one problem. I did more research on you, and nobody knows who you are. Isn't that interesting, seeing as though my name and my clubs are mentioned in several publications. Karen : That's not enough. You need to develop and manage your brand on social media just like everyone else. I'll show you. See all these owners? Partying with their clientele. Free bottle service isn't enough anymore. Regular people want to feel like celebs, like they have access. Give them access. Let them feel like they know you and they'll keep coming back for more. Dre : No doubt. Demand and supply. Don't you mean supply and demand? Dre : No, they've been teaching that wrong for years. You see, demand comes first, and whoever supplies it profits. Right. Karen, my brand is the mystery of James St. Patrick. People are intrigued by the unknown. Look, I want to take our relationship to the next level, but I can't set a meeting with my board of directors until you get on social media. Your brand needs a face. I can't sell a ghost.
