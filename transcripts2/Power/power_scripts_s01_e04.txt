 Ghost! We need to talk. 
 This club is the dream. 
 I don't know any old, wrinkled drug dealers. 
 They're either dead or inside. 
 They're not as good as you. 
 Retail side's been locked up tight since we sent those body parts around town. 
 You hire this m*therf*cker to boost my product? 
 f*ck, no, I've never seen him before. 
 Anibal Santalises. You want a ride home? 
 When was the last time you asked a girl out on a real date? 
 Do you even know how? 
 My boss told me not to get distracted. 
 But somehow when it comes to you... 
 I got you.

 I don't give a f*ck what Anibal said. 
 He's behind these hits. 
 Right now the retail business is all we got running. 
 We both know that sh1t alone is not paying the bills. 
 We need to light Anibal's ass up and turn this f*cking tap back on. 
 Anibal has always been a person who likes the status quo. 
 I don't see him making a move like that. 
 He's too f*cking lazy. 
 It's just as possible somebody's setting him up. 
 You over-think everything, man. 
 We burnt the sh1t out of that kid, and he told us that fatboy gave him the job. 
 Case closed for me. 
 Kanan would've had this m*therf*cker toe up already. 
 Yeah, and I ain't f*cking Kanan. 
 We're having this sit-down in a couple of days. 
 We kept 'em all dry for a minute now. 
 The m*therf*cker who ain't thirsty is the one hitting us. 
 We'll know for sure who's behind this sh1t when we're across a table staring them all in the eye. 
 What if it ain't one of them? 
 I mean... you ever think Lobos might be the one behind all this sh1t? 
 Every damn day. 
 But I can't figure out why he'd do it, why he wouldn't have had us capped already. 
 So until I got good answers to those f*cking questions, I gotta assume Lobos ain't involved. 
 We'll compare notes after this meeting and see where we end up. 
 All right. 
 We're gonna find out who's f*cking with us. 
 And then we're gonna kill 'em. 
 Hmm. 
 [Door opens] 
 There's my baby girl! Hey, come here! 
 Aww. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yo, what's up, "T"? 
 Go say hey to Uncle Tommy. 
 Come here. 
 Where you been? 
 Out... with 'Keisha. 
 'Keisha. 
 What? 
 Mm. 
 Leave her alone. You know that's my friend. 
 Mm-hmm, your friend that has everything to say about everything. 
 Yas doing all right after that thing the other night? 
 Yas has forgotten about it, of course. 
 I can't get it out of my head. 
 She was just fine, and then, boom. Yeah? 
 That's how things happen. 
 Your whole life can change in one breath. 
 I'm still trying to figure out where she got the keychain from in the first place. 
 You know, I'm gonna talk to the housekeeper about it. 
 It don't matter now, right? 
 Right. 
 Count our blessings while we have 'em. 
 Hey! Cynthia's here to talk about the Sutton Place Party. 
 Cool, where is she? 
 She's in your office. 
 Now don't give away the store to get this party, all right? 
 Offer her a good deal, not a great one. 
 Mm. 
 Should I come with? 
 I got this. 
 I got us 8:00 reservations at that Italian spot at 7th and the Park. 
 [Laughs] 
 You haven't heard the word "No" very often in your life, have you? 
 I hear it all the time, I just ignore it. 
 You have to find another date. 
 Maybe there's some girls getting off their shift at Cheetah's. 
 Hey, tell Kantos you feel sick so we can break out. 
 I'm working. 
 And Thursday's one of our busiest nights. 
 So I don't care if you're Derek Jeter, I'm not losing out on $1,000 worth of tips for anyone. 
 Here. 
 Here's 2,000. 
 Let's bounce. 
 I'm not gonna f*ck you. 
 Good to know. Can we go now? 
 [Coughs] 
 I think I'm coming down with the flu. 
 That drug overdose the other night is not the kind of publicity you want, James. 
 It wasn't an overdose. A girl got some bad coke. 
 Could happen anywhere. 
 But it happened here. 
 And it's unseemly of us to partner with a venue that has a reputation for drug use. 
 Now one incident's an anomaly, another one, well... 
 You should know that my budget for the Sutton Place Party has been dramatically trimmed. 
 But you shouldn't focus on money. 
 If I have the event here... 
 Truth will be in every major publication  from the New York Times to China Daily. 
 That's game-changing publicity for a new club like yours. 
 You need this party, trust me. 
 One party. 
 It's an anomaly. 
 Okay, you can have the venue. 
 All you have to cover is bar and staff. 
 But I want the rest of your parties this year... 
 Tribeca Film, Fashion Week, Hot List. 
 I want them all. 
 Okay, unfortunately those parties are already spoken for. 
 Fashion Week is at Parley. 
 Tribeca Film Festival is at Verbatim. 
 Simon Stern's clubs. 
 I'm offering you a better deal than he will. 
 As you said, your budget's been "Dramatically Trimmed." 
 Why don't you go talk to your employers and get back to me? 
 That's the kind of person I am. 
 I don't think first, I just do what I want. 
 What about you? What kind of person are you? 
 What kind of person am I? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know, a regular person? 
 [Laughs] Do you have any hobbies? 
 I mean, like, what do you for fun? 
 I don't know. Video games? 
 [Laughs] What are you, 13? 
 Hey, let's grab a drink. 
 What about dinner? 
 Drink now, eat later. 
 [Opens door] 
 Remember, no one dances on the banquettes. 
 That blonde bitch last week cost us 800 bucks in refinishing because of her f*cking Louboutins. 
 Headed uptown. 
 How'd it go with Cynthia? 
 Well, I told her all she'd have to do is cover bar and staff if she'd give us the rest of her parties this year. 
 Boss. 
 No, look. 
 I know we'll lose money. 
 But hey, if we get those events, fools will be cutting blank checks to get up in here. 
 Look, I get that you're building for tomorrow, but we gotta keep the lights on today. 
 See, short-term thinking creates short-term results. 
 Come on. 
 My first day of sixth grade, I find the biggest kid in P.S. 142 and bam! 
 I put him on his ass. Lights out. 
 Right hand to the motherfucking jaw. 
 So no one ever messed with you after that? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I was the only white kid for 20 blocks. 
 I got my ass kicked every day. 
 But I never gave up. 
 I never stopped fighting. 
 Some people are asking for it. 
 [Laughs] 
 Wow, it looks... looks good on you. 
 [Laughs] 
 It would look good on anyone. 
 Not like this. 
 We went 18 years, now I feel like I can't even make it two days. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I needed to see you too. 
 This... why did you... 
 I just wanted, you know, to give you something nice. 
 Make you feel special. 
 I feel special when you look at me. 
 You don't need to buy me anything. 
 [Laughs] 
 So... what now? 
 Are we "Going out"? Is that what we called it? 
 [Laughter] 
 My baby daughter almost died two days ago, Angie. 
 You... you have a daughter? 
 I have three kids. 
 And I have a wife. 
 I almost lost my baby girl Yasmine. 
 Yasmine. 
 And it made me think about you... and us. 
 I got no excuse. I should've told you. 
 I never stopped thinking about you... all these years. 
 I can't just ask you... 
 I have a boyfriend. 
 Greg. 
 Greg. 
 I guess we were just fooling ourselves. 
 I didn't tell you about Greg for the same reason you didn't tell me. 
 I just thought that... 
 Yeah, me too. 
 You should take this. 
 No. 
 You can't give it back. 
 That's a gift. 
 When you walked out of my life, you left ten days before your birthday. 
 Consider it a belated birthday present. 
 I should go home. 
 You should get back to your family. 
 Good night, Jamie. 
 Good night... Angie. 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 My body is my business. 
 Well... business is dope. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Rock music] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Glass clattering] 
 m*therf*cker! 
 Yeah! Beat his ass! 
 [Laughs] 
 You wanna f*cking touch her? 
 Yeah, yeah, fucker! 
 Punk! 
 [Grunts] 
 Don't come back! 
 Jesus. 
 Yeah, come on! 
 f*cking get out of here! 
 Yo! He touched her ass, yo! 
 He got what he deserved. Get back in your f*cking bar. 
 I'll beat down every m*therf*cker in there! 
 [Door slams] 
 [Gasps] That was awesome. 
 What the f*ck you talking about? 
 I snatched it from his neck. 
 This is where you live? 
 I don't actually spend a whole lot of time here, I guess. 
 I kinda hang out all over. 
 With other girls? 
 Naw! It's not like that. 
 I just... 
 Shh. 
 I don't care. 
 I lied to you before. 
 Turns out I am gonna f*ck you tonight. 
 I forgive you for lying. 
 If you lie to me, I won't forgive you, okay? 
 So don't do it. 
 Ah. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Promise? 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Got any blow? 
 It's always better with. 
 Yeah. I got some.

 How long until you can go again? 
 Girl, I don't know. 
 Things got better between us for a minute after the thing with the baby... 
 Right. but he's still keeping sh1t from me. 
 He's never done that before. 
 Well, if he didn't act the fool every now and then, then he wouldn't be a man. 
 Ooh, girl, look at these. 
 These are fly. 
 I bought them in black last week. 
 Of course you did. 
 Is there a reason why you pressing up on me? 
 Well, it's my job to protect you. 
 Who told you I need protection? Ghost? 
 No, I-I was just... 
 You need to back up, Shawn. 
 Oh, well, you can protect me anytime, baby. 
 [Laughs] 
 Come along, 'Keisha. 
 Relax, girl. 
 Everybody know that boy only got eyes for you, jump in front of the damn two train for you. 
 [Laughs] 
 You go out earlier this morning? 
 I missed you. 
 It's nice to be missed. 
 I was out shopping with 'Keisha, Shawn was breathing down my neck. 
 I checked him, and he said he was there to protect me. 
 Something I need to know about, Ghost? 
 Me and the kids need to get out of town for a while? 
 Nah, nothing like that. 
 Kid is just being over-protective, taking his job too seriously. 
 I'll tell him to ease up. 
 I'll talk to you after work. 
 You meeting up with Tommy? 
 Headed to the club. 
 I don't recall you getting up at the crack of dawn to head out to the Wash N' Folds, emptying quarters out the dryer. 
 This is different. 
 Yeah, looks that way. 
 Steady trying to figure out why. 
 I told you why. 
 Seems like you could spend the day at home with me and Yas. 
 You know, like you used to. 
 Everything I'm doing, I'm doing for you, Tasha! 
 What the f*ck is that supposed to mean? 
 Everything. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 So Lobos' New York distributor is meeting with his network. 
 We just don't know where or when it's happening. 
 My C.I. is trying to get me specifics, but as of right now I don't have anything beyond what I told you already. 
 Your C.I.'s info is bogus. 
 For the record, we haven't heard sh1t about a big meeting with Lobos' New York distributor, and we've been shaking trees all over town. 
 Maybe you're shaking around trees. 
 Or maybe this lead is just bullshit. 
 It's not bullshit. 
 It's legit intel that's been cultivated from a confidential informant. 
 It's how a real investigation is conducted. 
 Mm! 
 I don't need you to tell me how an investigation is conducted. 
 I been on Lobos since you were sucking on your mommy's titty, Knox. 
 [Laughs] 
 I was on your mama's titty last night. 
 Where are we on fatman? 
 Our opinion hasn't changed. 
 If in fact Lobos is looking to switch up his current connect, Anibal Santalises would be the most likely candidate. 
 He's got the infrastructure, the relationships, and the disposition. 
 We've got guys on him 24/7. 
 I want you two on him. 
 If he's the player you say he is, I want Agent Medina to handle surveillance personally. 
 Saxe, you work up the warrant. 
 Understood. 
 You stay on this distributor meeting. 
 If it's happening, we need to be there. 
 Ruiz won't go near Harlem. 
 Rolla won't f*ck with the Bronx, Anibal ain't feeling either of them. 
 We need to find some neutral ground for this sit-down. 
 Ghost! This sh1t's tomorrow! 
 We need to get everything in place. 
 Yeah, we'll do it at the Chinese spot downtown. 
 Lok Sing? What about food? 
 Rolla's on some vegan sh1t now. 
 This ain't no goddamn catered affair! 
 I put f*cking food on their table every f*cking day, Tommy. 
 M*therf*ckers gotta eat. 
 If one of these guys is behind these hits, we need to make sure they don't have the drop on us. 
 I don't want anybody stashing f*cking gats before we all get there, all right? 
 We do it okeydoke 20 minutes before game time. 
 And get the room swept. 
 I don't want anybody listening in on our sh1t. 
 We need to get to the bottom of this so things will go back to normal. 
 We need our sh1t to work smoothly so we can think about other things. 
 What other things? 
 Not this. 
 
 
 
 [Kids playing in distance] 
 [Door opens] 
 What do you got? 
 [Door closes] 
 I got what you want. 
 But it's gonna cost you. [Sniffs] 
 I was watching the FBI files...  and they said... [Sniffs] informants get paid. 
 So... you want information about this meeting... 
 [Scoffs] you pay. 
 Something tells me... you're not hurting for cash. 
 Hmm. 
 You got me there, mami. 
 You ever think, if we'd met a different way... 
 [Laughs] Nope. 
 Just tell me what I need to know. 
 Lok Sing Restaurant, downtown, 2:00 tomorrow. 
 And the New York connect's gonna be there? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We need you to wear a wire. 
 I told you I'm not invited. 
 I'm on the outside. 
 Then how'd you find out? 
 Little birdie told me. 
 Leave Isabel alone, Nomar. 
 Even if that's how you get your precious information? 
 Be careful no one makes you coming out of here. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Pastrami, pickles, and Swiss. Hot. 
 Mm! 
 Thanks for picking up Tariq from practice. 
 I would've asked Shawn, but... he's with Ghost. 
 Mm. 
 Speaking of Shawn, he was hanging real close this morning. 
 Told me it was for my protection. 
 What's going on, Tommy? 
 You know, I got kids to think about. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We got it under control. Don't worry. 
 Ghost ain't telling me sh1t. 
 It's all, "The club this, the club that." 
 [Scoffs] 
 So sick and tired of hearing about f*cking Truth. 
 Me too! 
 Did Ghost tell you he took a grip of money out of our personal account and used it to open Truth? 
 That's none of my business. 
 He didn't even tell me about it. 
 I had to find out myself. 
 Look where you live, Tasha. Look at your life. 
 From where I'm sitting, it looks like things are playing out pretty good for you. 
 So he dug in a little deep on this club bullshit. 
 So what? Doesn't change sh1t about your life. 
 He's changing, Tommy. Ghost is changing. 
 And that's not good for either of us. 
 You got any more pastrami up in here? 
 [Door closes] 
 [Door opens] 
 You should really take the "B" to the "N" or the "R" from the safe house. 
 You tailed me? 
 If you insist on seeing that piece of sh1t alone, I'm gonna watch your back. 
 You can't f*cking spy on me, Greg. 
 You're right. 
 Instead I should tell Frankie that you're subverting protocol to play footsie with that dick. 
 Did he even give you anything? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I got the address. 
 You're good. 
 You're f*cking stalking me. 
 Ah. 
 [Giggles] 
 I'm only stalking you... because I like you so much. 
 [Both laugh] 
 You're a dumbass. 
 You're a pain in my dumb ass. 
 Mm. 
 Did you tell Frankie about what Nomar said? 
 She's gonna call in the cavalry. 
 I know. 
 Better go right. 
 I know that. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you think about me leaving some clothes over here? 
 At this point, I'm staying over here a few nights a week. 
 It'll be easier for me to just leave some sh1t here. 
 You got any room in this drawer? 
 [Gasps] 
 [Slams drawer] 
 What the hell was that? 
 Um... 
 Angela, what the hell was that? 
 Are you hiding something in that drawer? 
 Of course not. 
 Then what's the problem? 
 What's going on here? 
 You haven't wanted to hang out, you've been distracted when we have hung out, and now you practically take my hand off when I mentioned leaving some clothes over here. 
 So what's up? 
 I mean, what are we doing here? 
 Is there someone else? 
 No. 
 There's no one else. 
 Then what is it? 
 I'm going home. 
 [Sighs] 
 Greg! 
 [Door opens, slams] 
 We have directional cameras set up on the street, but we couldn't get inside. 
 There's just too many people going in and out of there over the past 24 hours. 
 Did you guys hear that? We couldn't get inside. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Control, dispatch, for a 730 switching, secondary transmission. Stand by. 
 According to Valdes, this meeting's supposed to start in an hour. 
 Yeah, and Anibal's still up in his house eating pints of Cherry f*cking Garcia. 
 How the hell are they gonna have a meeting without him? 
 That's because there is no meeting. 
 Valdes is full of sh1t. [Laughs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Who'd you rather bang, Valdes or Frankie? 
 Frankie don't take dick. 
 I know! 
 But let's just say she does. 
 Or she would. 
 I'd go with Frankie. 
 I like a broad with balls. [Laughter] 
 Ah, I think I'd smash Valdes. 
 She's always got that expression on her face like she's so f*cking full of herself. 
 I wanna see what her face looks like when she's full of me. 
 You mean half full. 
 f*ck you. 
 They're all on their way. 
 Time for the okeydoke. 
 Do it now. 
 [Laughs] 
 You always land on your feet, don't you, Kantos? 
 Who's the man in charge? 
 You're looking at him. 
 Nobody is stupid enough to bankroll a spot for you, Kantos. 
 Come on. Where's the boss? 
 He's not here. 
 What can I help you with? 
 Jack sh1t. 
 You can help us with exactly jack sh1t. 
 We need to be laying eyes on your boss right now, or you're not gonna be opening up your doors tonight or any other night. 
 I got Victor, Darien, Queso, and Jayski patting M*therf*ckers down for steel at the door. 
 Now as far as food goes, I'm just having them bring those f*cking Pu Pu platter joints with a little something-something for everybody. 
 I figure Anibal's gonna be hungry as a m*therf*cker. 
 [Phone vibrating] 
 You remember when he ate 25 donuts? 
 Yeah? 
 Shutting us down? Tonight? 
 I'm on my way, Kantos. 
 Drop me off at the club. 
 Where the f*ck you going? 
 Cops saying they're gonna shut down Truth unless they speak to me face to face. 
 You're gonna have to run this meeting solo, Bro. 
 Are you f*cking with me? 
 We're getting hit, you shut sh1t down. 
 Now we got an entire network meeting and you're gonna go deal with some bullshit at the club? 
 They're shutting the club down, Tommy! 
 We wash more money up in there than we do at every other front we got combined. 
 You want me to just f*ck this off? 
 Hell, yeah, I do. 
 They want the f*cking owner. 
 That's me. I gotta deal with it. 
 You can handle this on your own, Tommy. 
 I don't even believe this sh1t. 
 You got this. 
 Just don't tell them you're turning sh1t back on. 
 Until we know who's hitting us, we're not moving any weight. 
 Go get Julio. 
 No time. 
 I'll take the kid with me. 
 Hit me when you're done. 
 [Door closes] 
 You ready for your balls to drop today, kid? 
 I want photos of anybody and everybody on that block. 
 I don't give a sh1t if it's little Sally Kimball walking her cockapoo, I want her photographed and I.D.'d, and I want the dog's license number. 
 Are all our cameras up? 
 They're up. 
 6987, now confirmed to copy. 
 Out. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Gags] 
 Everything's been permitted, the place is up to code, all our licenses... business, beverage, noise... are current. 
 Yeah, you see, the problem is, Jimmy... you don't mind if I call you "Jimmy," do you? 
 See, the problem is we know illegal narcotics have been sold inside this establishment. 
 As you can imagine that's a big problem for us. 
 Yeah, well, we're in the process of tracking down the dealer right now. 
 And I'm gonna make sure I turn him over to you as soon as I find him, okay? You have my word. 
 And that's great, Jimmy. 
 I mean, that's all a man really has, right? 
 His word. 
 But in this instance, I don't think your word's really gonna do the trick. 
 So what are you thinking, Ed, two weeks or so? 
 I'm not following. What do you mean by "Two Weeks"? 
 Jimmy, we gotta shut you down for at least 14 business days. 
 This is totally unreasonable. We have a business to run. 
 We gotta go through all your paperwork, we gotta get health in here, we gotta get fire in here. 
 We gotta make sure everything's on the up and up. 
 Officer, I just told you. Everything's up to code. 
 Well, sometimes it seems that way when it really isn't that way. 
 This is bullshit! 
 Enough. Look. 
 What do you say you give my partner and I some time, huh, to work out the kinks? 
 Pleasure. 
 The pleasure's mine. 
 Oh, and hey... keep us posted on that drug sting of yours. 
 They're gonna be back. 
 No sh1t. 
 This is a restaurant? 
 Yeah. 
 In our business, you try not to use the front door. 
 Oh, hey, hey, hey. Sorry. 
 Here's how it's gonna play. I sit down, you stand behind me. 
 Look straight ahead. 
 You don't look anyone in the eye. 
 And no matter what, you don't say a f*cking word. 
 Ever. 
 And by the way, while I'm thinking of it, lay off Tasha, man. 
 You don't spook her under any circumstances. 
 Get it? Let Ghost handle his wife. 
 All right, time to focus on this sit-down. 
 Stop distracting me, man. 
 What the f*ck? 
 What is it? 
 It ain't anything good. 
 [Camera shutters clicking] 
 What about the entrance on Elizabeth Street, anything? 
 Nothing. 
 Is there another way in? 
 Wait. 
 Isn't there an old tunnel system underneath all these buildings that the Tongs used back in the day? 
 Yeah. 
 But the entrance to the only remaining tunnel is on Doyers Street. 
 That's out on Chatham Square. 
 They wouldn't use that to come here. 
 I'm just thinking about what's underneath this neighborhood. 
 Get me a blueprint for the restaurant. 
 Angela, the agents already canvassed the building. 
 The entrances are covered. 
 Did they walk through all the floors? 
 See, there's no other entrance to Lok Sing from the street. 
 But if they came from the building behind it, the basement could still have a connecting door underground. 
 Street level, you'd never know you could get to the restaurant that way. 
 [Laughs] We should have known. 
 They're too smart to walk through the front door. 
 It's a guess. 
 You're right. 
 We looked. 
 Are you absolutely sure? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Because it's your call. It's on you. 
 And if I'm right, and they're in there, then we gotta go in right now. 
 We don't have sh1t on them. 
 We can't bust in there and arrest them for just having lunch. 
 I just want to see his face, Greg. 
 [Sighs] 
 I want to see him and know who he is. 
 Once we I.D. that distributor, we're this close to turning him and getting Lobos. 
 [Camera shutters clicking] 
 We're going in. 
 I guess Anibal can't tell time. 
 So... how's everybody doing? 
 We'd be better if we had product to sell. 
 I'm losing corners. 
 Me too. 
 Is that why you've been stepping all over mine? 
 Those aren't my people. 
 Just 'cause they black don't make 'em mine. 
 They flying your flag. 
 Bullshit. 
 And if they say they are, they lying. 
 Shut up. 
 You're lying, Rolla. 
 Kiss my ass, Ruiz. 
 Shut the f*ck up! 
 We may beef on the streets, but in here, we're business partners. 
 Speaking of partners, where's yours? 
 We call this big, important meeting and Ghost doesn't even bother to show up? 
 [Tires screeching] 
 So not only is he not getting us product... but he doesn't respect us enough to be here? 
 I got a connect in Mexico. 
 Says he can get us fish scale for half of what we're paying now. 
 Out of where? 
 Nueva Leon. 
 Ghost has been overcharging us. 
 We can do better. 
 I'm turning sh1t back on. 
 I'm gonna start moving weight to all of you again. 
 Hey. 
 [Gasps] 
 Let the agents clear the room first, Angela. 
 You wanna go with Ruiz and try another connect, go right ahead. 
 We're happy with you and Ghost, Tommy. 
 We don't do business with the Spanish. 
 What do you mean, Spanish? 
 I look to you like I'm from Spain, m*therf*cker? 
 When you come back... 
 FBI! Let me see your hands! 
 On your knees 'cause our sh1t is purer, we're gonna charge you double, Ruiz. 
 Don't move! 
 [Overlapped shouting] 
 Spring rolls up in this spot ain't got sh1t on Lok Sing. 
 In fact, I'd consider sucking a dick right now for some of them Lok Sing green beans. 
 Oh, hell, no. 
 [Laughs] 
 Why you switch up the spot for the meeting at the last second? 
 Can never be too careful. Always keep 'em guessing. 
 Can I get a fork, please? 
 We gotta know who's been hitting us. 
 Where the f*ck is Anibal? 
 [Sirens blip] 
 How long? 
 It could be one or two hours, three at the most. 
 And it was just the cut to the neck? 
 That's all she wrote. Looks professional. 
 Excuse me for a minute. 
 Who are you, and why the f*ck are you in my crime scene? 
 DEA. 
 f*ck off. 
 This is NYPD business. 
 We were surveilling Santalises for involvement with Felipe Lobos. 
 You mean you were right outside when this happened? 
 Wow. 
 Bang-up criminal interdiction there, gentlemen. 
 I think I'll handle it from here. 
 Detective... 
 Beat it! 
 Let's go. 
 [Elevator dings] 
 Where you at? 
 This sit-down should've ended a while ago. 
 Hit me back. 
 What sit-down? 
 Just trying to find Tommy. Hey. 
 Tommy went to a sit-down alone? 
 No, he took Shawn with him. 
 Shawn? 
 Since when do Tommy and Shawn do meetings without you? 
 Tommy needs to start stepping it up. 
 Why? You going somewhere? 
 No, I'm not going anywhere, Tasha. 
 I'm stuck here, right where you want me. 
 What was the sit-down about? 
 [Phone vibrating] 
 Senor Lobos. Que paso? 
 [Line trilling] 
 Shawn, it's Tasha. 
 I need you to pick up some groceries for me. 
 Fantasma, how are you? 
 How's things? 
 Things are under control, Jefe. 
 Are they? 
 I find it interesting that the death of one Primera  and the insubordination of another meet your definition of... "Under Control." 
 Death? 
 I was hoping he was the problem, and you eliminated him. 
 But now I see I was wrong. 
 NYPD should pay better. 
 The question is not why I know that Anibal is dead, the question is why you don't know Anibal is dead, and why your friend, Vibora Ruiz, is so anxious to take your position in my organization. 
 He reached out to you directly? 
 Of course. 
 I said no to his proposal out of deference to you, and the promise that you would handle the problems in your network... 
 [Groans] 
 A promise that is yet unfulfilled. 
 [Crying] 
 You see, Ghost, I refuse to tolerate disloyalty in the men that work for me. 
 The moment I detect disloyalty, I cut it out like a cancer. 
 If you don't, it will grow and the whole organism will die. 
 [Crying] 
 Have a good night, Ghost. 
 [Line disconnects] 
 I specifically told you not to tell them when we're turning sh1t back on. 
 Ruiz said he had another connect with a better price. 
 The whole point of the meeting was to figure out who's robbing us. 
 You said the m*therf*cker who ain't thirsty is the guy who's hitting us. 
 Anibal didn't even show to the meeting. 
 Is that not thirsty enough for you? 
 Anibal's dead. 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 Lobos called and told me. 
 How the f*ck does he know? 
 He got people in NYPD. 
 Jesus Christ! 
 You do it? 
 Do what? 
 Anibal. 
 You seemed pretty f*cking sure it was him hitting us. 
 Are you taking sh1t into your own hands, huh? 
 Come here to me. 
 I'm already here. 
 Get out of my face. 
 You f*cking kidding me? 
 You think I killed Anibal? 
 You think I'd play you like that? 
 Hmm? 
 We had a conversation. 
 You told me sit tight, and I did. 
 I also told you not to tell them we were gonna start moving sh1t. 
 I didn't f*cking kill Anibal, Ghost. 
 Lobos said Ruiz is behind this sh1t. 
 Said he met with him about stepping it up. 
 He was gappin' the f*ck off as this meeting. 
 Ruiz has to go, Tommy. 
 f*ck, yeah. Do or die, baby. 
 [Laughs] 
 Do or die. 
 [Sighs] 
 Girl, it's like you said. 
 You know, if I wanna know what Ghost is up to, then who better to tell me than the cat who's with him all day? 
 [Laughs] 
 I mean, I wouldn't say he's wrapped around my little finger yet... but he will be.
