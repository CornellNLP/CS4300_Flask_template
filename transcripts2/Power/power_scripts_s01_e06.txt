 Previously on Power... 
 Vibora Ruiz has a thing for poisonous snakes. 
 I got you just the ticket to get you in the high council of the Soldado Nation. 
 Happy high holy day, Vibora. 
 [Laughs] 
 What's going on between my husband and Tommy? 
 You can tell me. 
 It'll be another one of our little secrets. 
 I want to know what we're doing here. 
 Are we just f*cking? 
 I am making a choice with you. 
 This ain't some skank-ass broad. 
 Holly's different. She's special. 
 You better not have told her about our other thing. 
 I told you it was Ruiz all along. 
 Yeah, except when you said it was Anibal. 
 Except then. I don't care. 
 Now I just want to kill a m*therf*cker. 
 Ruiz got stabbed. 
 It wasn't the Jamaicans we hired. 
 Someone went after him and missed. 
 He ain't dead. 
 Back then, Kanan kept us in line, taught us the business, made us men. 
 Ghost and I owe your father big. 
 That's why you're here.

 [Buzzer in background] 
 Check. 
 You ain't gonna get me this time, K. 
 I've been practicing. 
 Yes, you have. 
 Checkmate, m*therf*cker. 
 [Laughs] 
 What the f*ck you talking about? 
 You see it. [Laughing] 
 Don't make me smile you up right here, m*therf*cker. 
 Your mama won't appreciate no closed casket. 
 Kanan, you got a visitor. 
 Yeah? 
 [Buzzer] 
 You need to stop with that Ruy Lopez bullshit. 
 Rack 'em back up. 
 I'll be back. 
 I been saying the same sh1t all along. 
 We're calling it prosecutorial misconduct. 
 I don't give a f*ck what you call it, as long as it means I get out. 
 The police officer that stopped you admitted that the prosecutor told him to omit certain elements from his report, including the fact that your back headlight, the reason why he stopped you in the first place, wasn't blown out, but rather, had been removed... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 The bulb unscrewed. 
 Somebody wanted me to get pulled over with drugs in the trunk. 
 I told my first lawyer that sh1t. 
 They set my ass up. 
 It doesn't matter that you were set up. 
 It matters that the prosecutor had material evidence to support that theory and hid those facts, so the jury never knew. 
 Okay. 
 The D.A. figured, Kanan's young and black, he's guilty. 
 Who gives a sh1t about the rules? 
 This D.A. has a bunch of cases under judicial review. 
 That's why you're getting out fast. 
 When? 
 Ain't you cold in that sh1t? 
 Stopped standing on the corner years ago. 
 Don't need no puffy working from the inside. 
 You could do it too, boy. You're smart. 
 No, man. I love the streets. 
 I ain't trying to be no house nigga. 
 Change come from inside the house, Rolla. 
 Who the f*ck want to change? 
 [Laughs] 
 I heard Ruiz got hit. 
 Stabbed inside a motherfucking strip club. 
 God damn. 
 Strip club supposed to be sacred, you feel me? 
 One minute you getting a good dick burn, next, you getting gutted open like a fish. 
 Yeah. 
 Streets are saying you did it. 
 You ask for the weather report, don't get mad when they say it's gonna rain. 
 You believe what you heard? 
 If y'all was behind it, we'd be at Ruiz's funeral right now. 
 But first Anibal, now this? 
 You can't blame niggas for wagging tongues. 
 Looks like you cleaning house. 
 Or you eliminating the competition. 
 'Sup, Em? 
 I told you to stop it with that sh1t. 
 If I was Eminem, I would be getting my dick sucked by some actress right now, not freezing my balls off out here with you. 
 Yo, Rolla says folks are saying we called the hit on Ruiz. 
 That's some bullshit. 
 I say we go by tomorrow and make sure he knows where we stand. 
 I wouldn't walk in unprotected. 
 Soldados shoot first, ask questions after the fact. 
 You want to come with me, Rolla? 
 I'll let you go in first. 
 Good to see you, G. 
 My man. 
 Night, Marshall. 
 f*ck you. 
 I never get why you like him so much. 
 He's loyal, and he's smart. 
 He's too smart to try some sh1t with Ruiz without knowing our play. 
 You think Cool Runnings gapped off? 
 Gapped off about what? 
 Why would the Jamaicans brag about a botched hit? 
 They didn't even hit Ruiz. 
 Owe us a motherfucking store credit. 
 I know Ruiz didn't check into no real hospital. 
 Make sure you know where he's hiding. 
 We'll go there tomorrow. 
 Rolla is right about one thing. 
 If the Soldados suspect us, they'll have itchy trigger fingers. 
 I better go alone. 
 No f*cking way. 
 I ain't gonna let you get clipped right before Tasha's birthday. 
 If the worst happens, she'll never forgive me. 
 You forgot about her birthday? 
 Damn, man, she's your wife. 
 How come I remember, you don't? 
 I got a lot on my mind, Tommy. 
 Well, you're welcome. I'll call you when I get out. 
 Do that. 
 We could've met you during the day. 
 This is the only time I could get away without them knowing I was gone. 
 That's live, so from now on, try to get yourself near Ruiz and his top guys when you're talking business. 
 Especially if they mention Lobos or the distributor. 
 We'll be able to hear everything. 
 Everything, so take your jacket off before you rub one out, okay? 
 I don't want to hear that sh1t. 
 I thought you were the reptile guy. 
 You were supposed to. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 If anything happens, we'll be on you in 30 seconds. 
 It takes less than a second for someone to pull the trigger. 
 Then we'll be 29 seconds late. 
 [Snickers] 
 f*ck this. 
 Get someone else to be your snitch. 
 Agent Knox is just f*cking with you. 
 Nothing's gonna happen to you. 
 You have my word. 
 Your word? 
 I'll remember that when I'm bleeding out. 
 Look at it this way. 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 Either wear the mic, or try your luck up at sing sing. 
 Pedos do really good up there, I hear. 
 f*ck you. 
 You flirting with him, Nomar? 
 Enough! 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 You don't have a choice. 
 f*ck all of you then. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 [Door closes] 
 You're home early. 
 Figured you'd be at the club all night. 
 Wasn't at the club. I was with Tommy. 
 I'd ask you what's up with Tommy, but you ain't gonna tell me anyway, so... 
 Well, I don't want your pretty little head to worry about any of that. 
 I want you to concentrate on throwing yourself the biggest, best birthday party money can buy. 
 I thought you forgot. 
 Now, you see that? 
 You thought wrong. 
 Mmhmm. 
 Yeah, well, it would've been nice to know a couple of weeks ago. 
 But that would've ruined the whole surprise now, wouldn't it? 
 Sounds like bullshit to me. 
 [Laughs] 
 Look, baby, I had this whole thing planned. 
 I did, and then I thought, well, who better to design your party than you? 
 You'd hate what anyone else put together anyway. 
 You got me there. 
 I already called Kantos. 
 You and Lakeisha go down tomorrow, get whatever you want, invite whoever. 
 Your husband's got you. 
 Mm. 
 Thank you, baby. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay, I promise I won't break the bank, okay? 
 Don't make no promises you can't keep, woman. 
 I promise. 
 Okay. 
 [Indistinct TV chatter] 
 You can't sleep? 
 Something on your mind? 
 Look. 
 I know. 
 It sucks to hear your best friend is cheating on your other best friend. 
 Skanks throw themselves at club owners all the time. 
 He'll come back to his senses. 
 Whatever. I'm over that. 
 I'm fine. 
 It's just work stuff. 
 What time are you gonna be home? 
 I was thinking I'd make you some Cincinnati Chili. 
 You know, over spaghetti, with cinnamon? 
 I bet you never had that. 
 Sounds f*cking disgusting. 
 [Laughs] 
 You... Are gonna eat it and like it. 
 Look, Hol, I... 
 I might be a little late tonight. 
 How late? 
 I... you can make that sh1t for me another night. 
 Another night? 
 You like having me around, huh? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I need to go shopping today anyway. 
 I'll see what you got in the kitchen. 
 There ain't sh1t in there. 
 This box of cereal expired two years ago! 
 Told ya. 
 Tommy, what's this? 
 Cash. 
 No sh1t. 
 Thank you for that comprehensive explanation. 
 From where? 
 From the club. 
 Bullshit it is! 
 I don't like banks, that's all. 
 What's the problem? 
 There are four more of those in the kitchen. 
 You are a bank. 
 You shouldn't be f*cking snooping. 
 f*ck you, Tommy. 
 I told you not to f*cking lie to me. 
 [Buzzer] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Look at you, all G'ed up. 
 You stacking? 
 What? Nah, nah, nah. 
 Uncle G bought me this suit. 
 Sign of respect. 
 You must be stepping it up. 
 Yeah, and maybe when you get out in a year, you know, maybe I'll be somebody. 
 Maybe. 
 Hey, I hear M*therf*ckers out there beefing. 
 Is it the Soldados, the Tainos? 
 Um... 
 It's okay. 
 It's safe to talk here. 
 The Tainos got hit. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, and somebody took Anibal out too. 
 No sh1t. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 And Ruiz got hit. 
 Maybe in retribution or maybe not, but I don't really know. 
 Why you don't know? 
 'Cause I don't ask no questions. 
 Your Uncle G pulled you in, so he expects you to ask questions. 
 He expects you to come to play, son. 
 I'm just his driver. 
 As long as you see yourself as that, it's all you'll ever be. 
 We all start off small, man. 
 Runner, corner, cash-kid. 
 Question is, what are you gonna make of yourself? 
 I'm working hard. 
 That's good. 
 But not good enough. 
 How you supposed to learn how G thinks if you don't know his next move, hmm? 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah, I'm telling you. 
 G waiting on you to prove yourself. 
 Show him you got the hustle. Get in there. 
 Take what's yours. 
 Take what's yours. 
 Please tell Mr. Stern that I called to set a meeting. 
 I bet he did forget your birthday. 
 Now it's your chance to make him pay. 
 Let's put the man-quarium right here. 
 Girl, what the f*ck is a man-quarium? 
 A giant fish tank filled with men. 
 You're out of your mind. 
 It's your 30th birthday. 
 Exactly. 
 And I want it to be grown and sexy, but not with no ghetto-ass sh1t. 
 Mrs. St. Patrick's right. 
 I was thinking we can come up with a birthday shout out at the top of every hour. 
 We can come up with a signature cocktail or maybe even do a balloon or a confetti drop. 
 First of all, she's turning 30, not 13. 
 So enough with the balloon stomping, all right? 
 And make sure there's plenty of Ciroc, because that's all my people drink, and no coconut because I'm allergic to nuts. 
 Thank you. 
 I really couldn't wait to see you. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm starting... 
 [grunts] I'm starting to get distracted at work. 
 It's bad. 
 Not all bad. 
 [Both moaning] 
 [Cell phone vibrating, chiming] 
 Hello? 
 Yes, that's fine. 
 I'll be right there. 
 You okay? 
 Everything good? 
 It's my father. 
 He's, uh, not well. 
 I gotta go. 
 I can pay for the room if you want. 
 No, are you kidding? I got the room. 
 Don't worry about the room. 
 He's out in Long Island. 
 Gotta get the train. 
 Paz said he was unhappy there, and I should've listened. 
 I could hear him screaming in the back room. 
 Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 He's gonna be okay. 
 Look at me. 
 He's gonna be okay, all right? 
 My ride's downstairs. I can take you. 
 I want to take you. 
 [Shouting in Spanish] 
 You're not listening! 
 [Shouting in Spanish] 
 Why is that man in Mr. Williams' bed? 
 Papi, Papi.

 Shh. 
 The doctors are looking out for you, Papi. 
 We all are. 
 Paz will be by later, okay? 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 That's my friend, Jamie St. Patrick. 
 He drove me here. 
 The punk from the corner? 
 The drug dealer? 
 I thought I told you to stay away from that boy. 
 He's no good. 
 Pap... Papi, shh. 
 [Shushing] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 He's finally asleep. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's so hard to believe he's the same man that grilled me on spelling, grounded me when I got a "B." 
 [Laughs] 
 God, he could be an asshole sometimes, but now he's... 
 He's helpless, so scared. 
 [Sobbing] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm a mess. 
 Angie, is there anything I can do? 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 I don't think so, unless you can make this all go away. 
 This is Holly. 
 Obviously I'm doing something more important than taking your call, so leave a message. 
 [Beep] 
 Hey, call me back. 
 If I don't answer... 
 Nevermind. 
 Just call me.

 Nice of you to visit. Where's Ghost?

 She won't let me f*ck her in the ass. 
 Her sister will, though. 
 I been stabbed twice. I'd rather get shot. 
 It wasn't us, Ruiz. 
 I heard different. 
 We ain't got no beef with you. 
 You're drug dealers. You got beef with everybody. 
 They say the same thing about you. 
 Maybe it was Anibal's people. Maybe it was Rolla. 
 Neither of those M*therf*ckers got any love for you, and really, nobody else wants you dead? 
 You're a drug dealer too, Ruiz. 
 You got more enemies than you even know. 
 Look. 
 If me and Ghost was behind this hit, I wouldn't be here right now, and neither would you.

 Your  compai's  been acting kind of strange tely, going out of his way to be all nice to me, but then not showing up at meetings he arranges. 
 With all this bullshit going on, he's trying to keep a low profile, something you might want to consider doing. 
 [Groans] 
 Celebrating my high holy day, and this  puta  sticks me. 
 The hitter was a girl? 
 What'd she look like? 
 She looked like ice cream and sunshine till she stuck me. 
 Great tits, beautiful ass, Latin girl, strong. 
 A girl hit us too. 
 Anything else you remember? 
 I wasn't looking at her face, man. 
 Light hair, curly. 
 We find this girl, we find out who's been hitting us. 
 Oh, you're goddamn right, Ruiz. 
 We in this together. 
 I haven't been back here since I left. 
 The Bodega got replaced, of course, with this pet store. [Chuckles] 
 But otherwise just like the old days. 
 I thought you could use a milk shake. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hmm? 
 You think they still make black-and-whites? 
 Well, that's why we here. 
 Only one way to find out, Miss Big-time. 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 Oh. 
 Just give me a second, baby. 
 What's up? 
 Are you on your way in? 
 No, I'm having lunch out in Forest Hills. 
 You just want to hear my voice? What? 
 Your wife's birthday... you sounded serious, and I'm trying to make it work, but I'm gonna have to call in more staff, pay overtime. 
 Th's fine. 
 The other woman wanted 20 cases of Ciroc. 
 Yeah, whatever they need, just do it. I gotta go. 
 Wait, there's one more thing. Simon Stern... just make it happen.

 Who's the  blanquito  in there with Ruiz? 
 That's the guy who gets us the products. 
 Distro. 
 I'm going in. 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo. You'll blow our cover. 
 You want to call your girlfriend and ask if you can pretty please do your f*cking job, you go for it, all right? 
 I've been on this case three years now. 
 If Lobos' distributor's in that building, I'm getting a look. 
 Son of a f*cking bitch. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Who would know a girl like that? 
 Anibal's dead, I don't think Rolla would use a female for wetwork. 
 Lobos. 
 Ghost don't think so. 
 You, Ghost... 
 Have taken your eye off the ball. 
 Nah, man. 
 We just waiting for our pitch. 
 Now, I'm gonna find this bitch. 
 I'm gonna make things righ with us.

 I can't talk right now. I gotta go. 
 All right, you got my undivided attention. 
 f*ck. 
 [Line rings] 
 You've reached 347-555... 
 [line rings] 
 Kantos, it's Tommy. Where's your boss? 
 Is he talking to some club asshole over there? 
 I thought he was having lunch with you out in Forest Hills. 
 He's in Forest Hills? 
 That's what he said. 
 Got off the phone in a hurry. 
 [Engine starts] 
 I'm sorry my dad said that... 
 Ah. 
 About you being a punk, a drug dealer. 
 Yeah, he remembers what he remembers. 
 He remembers wrong. 
 You don't just become a good guy, Jamie. 
 To get where you are now means you were always one inside. 
 I was right about you all along. 
 [Engine revs] 
 You're always taking me someplace to eat like you're trying to fatten me up or something. 
 [Laughs] 
 No, I just like the look on your face when something gets real good to you. 
 Mm, you must see that look a lot. 
 [Both laugh] 
 No, it's different, though. 
 It's your body and your smile and your mind, the way you think. 
 It's all of you. 
 It's not what you are. It's who you are. 
 Look, Jamie... 
 Mmhmm, what? 
 Do you want to come over tonight? 
 What about Greg? 
 There is no more Greg. 
 Hmm. 
 No more hotels, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [Door opens, bells jingle] 
 Thank you. 
 What are the odds? 
 My God, Tommy. 
 [Both laugh] 
 How you doing, Angie? 
 Not bad. 
 How about yourself? 
 Look at you. 
 I'm holding my own, holding my own. 
 Get me a black-and-white, large. 
 I was just visiting a sick friend of mine not too far from here. 
 He sends his regards, so I figured, why not pick up the best black-and-white in New York on my way home? 
 I thought you'd be at the club. 
 What are you two doing way out here? 
 Oh, you know, just catching up on old times. 
 It seems like forever ago. 
 I'll never forget the time you tried to hook me up with your friend, the hot one, Italian. 
 Silvana, she had a thing for you. 
 Oh, not enough to let me get to second base, and trust me, I tried. 
 I got my hand up in there. 
 [Groans] She cancelled Christmas on your boy with a quickness. 
 Kicked me right out onto the street. 
 You know who would love these crazy stories about when we was kids? 
 His wife, Tasha. 
 Tomorrow night, we're having a big birthday party for her at the club. 
 You should come. 
 I work late Thursdays. 
 Aw, too bad. 
 Another time. 
 I'm gonna go. 
 I don't want your ice creams to melt. 
 Thanks. 
 You got it. 
 Thank you. 
 Call me later. 
 You bet. 
 [Bells jingle] 
 [Slurping] 
 [Bells jingle] 
 I think I'm just gonna catch the train back to the city. 
 Angie, I'm sorry. 
 Sorry about what... that you're married, that your best friend knows your wife, that he mentions her name casually in conversation because he doesn't know we're sleeping together? 
 I'm sorry about Tommy. 
 Forget about everything he said. 
 Look, I want to be here with you and later at your place. 
 I'll call you, Jamie. 
 [Groans softly] 
 We had a shot, and I took it. 
 No, you jeopardized the entire operation on your own. 
 Who knows when or if we would've had an opportunity like that? 
 And what if someone made you? 
 Nobody made me. 
 You're sure about that? 
 Positive. 
 Because I know how to handle myself on and off the field, unlike some of us in this room. 
 f*ck you, Medina. 
 I'll have Ankie call your S.A.C. over at the D.E.A., get you sent back where you came from. 
 Oh, really? 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Vaya.  Take it to Frankie. 
 This way, um, I can get a few things out in the open myself. 
 Excuse me. 
 [Door slams] 
 I did the best I could to keep him from going in. 
 He didn't even get a good look at the guy? 
 No. 
 I sent the audio to forensics to see if they can clean it up. 
 We should hear something within 24 hours. 
 Yeah, well, I'll be here. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 Reached Angela Valdes. 
 I'm unable to take your... 
 [door opens] 
 So... 
 Lunch was nice yesterday. How was the rest of the date? 
 None of your f*cking business. 
 That's funny, since the other night, you were all up in my business about me seeing Holly. 
 Look, when you get tired of this girl... 
 I'm not gonna get tired of her. 
 Okay, well, when you do, she's gonna get f*cking pissed. 
 She's gonna f*ck up our whole club, the money, every f*cking thing, Tommy. 
 You worried about me f*cking up the club? 
 If Tasha ever found out that you were nailing another broad, she'd blow up your family and our whole f*cking game. 
 She'd take you to the cops just to see your cheating ass rot in prison. 
 First of all, lower your f*cking voice, man. 
 Secondly, Tasha wouldn't do that, and thirdly, she ain't gonna know sh1t 'cause you ain't gonna tell her sh1t. 
 Oh, you're damn right I ain't gonna tell her. 
 That don't mean she won't find out. 
 I bet your phone is full of texts from Angie and cute little voice messages. 
 "So good to see you again after all this time after I broke your heart and threw it in a f*cking dumpster." 
 Forgot all about that, huh? 
 It's different now. 
 Yeah, you're married. That's what's different now. 
 Look, I got the whole situation under control. 
 Yeah. 
 You always think you got everything on lock. 
 Ruiz says a girl stabbed him. 
 Same as hit Liliana and chased 'Bueso. 
 Ruiz says it was a Latina chick with nice tits and long, light-colored hair. 
 Bet we could get a better description if we could ask Liliana, but, whoa, my bad. 
 We can't, since we had her iced. 
 Didn't know I knew about that, huh? 
 I been looking at that bitch for weeks, waiting for you to say something. 
 "Hey, Tommy, I know we agreed to kill her, but I changed my mind." 
 That would've worked. 
 Thought she was more useful alive. 
 I made a judgment call. 
 Now we can have Julio go back to Liliana to see if Ruiz's description lines the f*ck up, if she remembers anything. 
 Yeah. 
 We gotta find this girl, man, and who she's working for. 
 That's all that matter Tommy. 
 None of this other bullshit. 
 Yo, G. 
 Angela was trouble before, and she's trouble again. 
 I just don't want to see you get f*cked up. 
 That's all. 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 Hi, Shawn, we're almost ready. 
 Mama, you look beautiful. 
 Yeah, that's a real nice dress, Mrs. St. Patrick. 
 Thank you both. 
 Raina, have you seen my diamond hoop earrings? 
 No, I'm smart enough to stay away from your stuff. 
 But not smart enough to figure out your fractions. 
 Did you finish your homework, son? 
 Yeah, that's what I thought. 
 Game off until you're finished, okay? 
 All right, let's roll out. 
 Let me find my earrings first. 
 Watch your mama blame me for that somehow. 
 Join the club, dad. 
 Yeah. 
 Shawn, you went to visit your pops? 
 How'd it go? 
 Yeah, he's good. 
 I don't think he's eating enough, though, so he's looking a lot leaner and tighter from all the push-ups. 
 Tell him I sent my regards? 
 Of course. 
 And he sent his back too. 
 Cool. 
 Can you tell my dad I'm old enough  for Assassin's Creed now, Shawn? 
 What you trying to do, get me killed? 
 Do your homework. 
 Did you find them? 
 No. 
 They'll pop up sooner or later. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Okay, you two, listen to big mama, all right? 
 Okay. 
 I'll see you in the morning. 
 Good night, baby girl. Take care of your sister. 
 You want to keep that PS3, you do your homework for real, now. 
 Good night, babies. 
 Good night. 
 How long you gonna duck my calls? 
 Until you're straight with me, there's nothing to talk about. 
 It's just f*cking money. Why do you care? 
 I have it. Enjoy it. 
 Tommy, if it was about your money, I wouldn't be in these heels and this slutty dress. 
 I would be home on my night off. 
 Kantos made you come in for this? 
 Let me talk to that little bitch. 
 Do you really not understand why I'm mad at you? 
 You're mad because you don't believe me. 
 But that's on you, all right? That's not my problem. 
 Then why are you f*cking calling me all day? 
 You don't get to pick and choose what part of your life you let me into. 
 Look, Holly. 
 I'm not lying to you, all right? 
 [Scoffs] 
 I got work to do. 
 Holly!

 Great party last night. 
 How tired are you? 
 I'm not. I'm ready. 
 Gentlemen, welcome. 
 Thank you for venturing up here. 
 Pleasure, sir. 
 Ah, the elusive James St. Patrick. 
 Simon Stern. Pleasure. 
 Come in. Make yourself comfortable. 
 Here, have a seat. 
 Let me cut to the chase. 
 Cynthia Sheridan took her business from me to come to you and your club... 
 Truth. 
 Truth. 
 That vexed me a great deal. 
 It wasn't personal, sir. 
 Of course not. 
 But it made me think either you're stupid and don't care about profit... because you basically gave the whole cow away for free... or you're smart and have something I don't. 
 Other than the Cynthia Sheridan parties? 
 We have a full house every night, another 500 waiting out in the cold, two DJs on retainer, a back entrance for celebrities. 
 Something tells me Simon knows our stats already. 
 You're asking what makes us more than just lightning in a bottle. 
 You're right, I am. 
 You're wanting to know what I have to offer you. 
 Well, you have to make me an offer. 
 I see. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Holly! Hoy. 
 Yo, Holly! Been looking all over for you. 
 Get in the car. 
 f*ck you. 
 You stole from Tasha, and I lied to cover your ass. 
 Now get in the f*cking car! 
 What kind of f*cking criminal are you? 
 You owe me one now. 
 Come on, get in the car. 
 What the f*ck you thinking stealing from Tasha, my family? 
 I didn't think she would miss them. 
 Her closet, it's like a f*cking department store. 
 It doesn't matter how much sh1t she has. 
 She's like my sister. 
 I told you that before we went to their place. 
 Look... 
 I like to take sh1t. 
 That's just who I am. 
 [Exhales] 
 I'm sorry, though. It was a dick move. 
 You can rat me out to her if you want. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Whoa, where you going now? 
 All that money I found in your place, Tommy... that's not from the club. 
 No, it's not. 
 But if you're gonna be my girl, I gotta be able to trust you, Holly. 
 What I tell you, you... Can't tell nobody 'cause nobody else knows. 
 I want to know. 
 Thing is, I sell some dope on the side to make a little extra money. 
 I'm a drug dealer. 
 I'm not f*cking stupid. 
 Your phone isn't ringing day and night. 
 You don't live in some shitty wackup. 
 And there's no way "some dope" pays for a nightclub. 
 Whatever you're doing ain't a goddamn hobby. 
 Tell me the truth, Tommy. 
 I'm at the top of the food chain. 
 I got a crew of M*therf*ckers hustling for me, and we move serious weight. 
 If I go away, I go away for good. 
 You wanted the truth. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 So what you think? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I am a fucked-up thief, and you are a crazy drug dealer. 
 I think you and I were made for each other. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 You're here. 
 I'm here. 
 Unannounced. 
 I like the element of surprise. 
 You said you and Greg are over. 
 We are. 
 So can I come in? 
 I think that's a bad idea. 
 I saw Simon Stern today. 
 It went great. 
 He wants to have dinner, keep talking about a future. 
 Congratulations, Jamie. 
 I'm really happy for you. 
 You're the first person I wanted to tell. 
 In fact, you're the only person I wanted to tell. 
 When I'm with you, I can't hold myself back. 
 I want to. 
 I want the reality to matter, but it doesn't. 
 I just see you. 
 I get wrong when I'm away from you. 
 I need another hit to get right. 
 [Laughs] 
 Another hit? 
 That's exactly how it feels. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I was so committed to not seeing you, and then you just knock on my door, and I let you in. 
 A girl only has so much resolve. 
 Sorry. 
 [Laughs] No, you're not. 
 What were you even supposed to talk about anyway? 
 Stern. 
 My meeting. 
 Tell me. 
 Come on. 
 Well, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we talked about partnering, expansion, Vegas, Miami. 
 Mm, I like Miami. 
 [Giggling] 
 Sorry, babe. 
 I know. 
 I don't want you to go. 
 I don't want to go. 
 I mean, is there any way... could you stay the night? 
 Never mind, I know the answer. 
 Reality calls. 
 I wish I could, Angie. 
 Hey, hey. 
 It won't always be like this. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 I promise. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Thank you so much, Shawn. 
 I hope you got a chance to enjoy some of the party the other night. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Actually, um... 
 I got you a little something myself. 
 Shawn, you did not have to do that. 
 You do enough already. 
 Nah, it's just a little something. 
 I hope it makes you smile. 
 I heard you say you lost a pair of earrings, so, um... 
 They're beautiful. 
 But I can't accept them. 
 I wouldn't want Ghost to get the wrong idea. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Excuse me? 
 What was that? 
 Shawn, what did you just say? 
 Nothing. I didn't say anything. 
 I mean, you deserve someone who's as loyal to you as you are to him. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 He's always just putting other stuff ahead of you. 
 But what the hell do I know? 
 I'm just the driver, right? 
 I need men down in the garage and at all the doors. 
 Someone coming. 
 Security needs to be tight. 
 Who knows what this f*cking [Speaking spanish] has planned. 
 Who? 
 I'm expecting Ghost, the  pendejo  who supplies us and most likely put these f*cking holes in me. 
 [Recording rewinding] 
 What this f*cking [speaking spanish] Has planned. 
 Who? 
 I'm expecting Ghost, the  pendejo  who supplies us and most likely put these f*cking holes in me. 
 You want me to frisk him? 
 What do you think? 
 I'm telling you this piece of sh1t tried to have me killed, and you're asking me if you should see if he's carrying a weapon? 
 What the f*ck? 
 [Recording rewinding] 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 Has planned. 
 Who? 
 I'm expecting Ghost,  the pendejo who supplies us  and most likely put these f*cking holes in me. 
 You want me to frisk him? 
 I'm expecting Ghost.
