 Is everything all right... My Princess? 
 Yes, My King. 
 [Chuckling] I should think so. 
 In a few moments, we shall marry, and you will instantly become the richest, most powerful woman in the land. 
 Yes, My King. Very exciting. 
 And then... tonight... 
 You will join me in my bed. 
 Yes, My King. 
 We're going to do it! [Snaps fingers] 
 Yes. 
 We're not going to just sit in bed and open gifts and talk about how much fun the wedding was, okay? 
 We're... doing... it. 
 Yep. 
 My lady. 
 I mean, of course, we're going to open  some  presents, but then we're going to do it. 
 Got it. 
 Ohh! 
 Ugh! 
 Ohh! Aah! 
 Aah! 
 ♪ By all the stars above, I'll save my one true love ♪ 
 Hey, look! Oh, wow! It's him! 
 Both : ♪ it's Gala... ♪ 
 [Both groan] 
 [Grunts] [Grunts] 
 [Groans] ♪ I shall not be denied until she's by my side ♪ 
 I suggest you fall. 
 [Moans] 
 Thanks! 
 And so, on this glorious day, we celebrate the union of our greatest king! 
 Galavant : So sorry to interrupt. 
 My lady. 
 All right, all right. [Chuckling] Hold on. 
 Now, Gareth and I could surely fight all night to an even draw, if that's what you want. 
 Hell, you can even send all your men to help him, if you so desire. 
 But I'll fend them all off. 
 'Cause here's the thing. 
 I love her, Richard. 
 She's the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the eve. 
 And you can offer her great fame, and you can offer her great fortune, but... 
 Only I can offer her great love. 
 And that is what she chooses. 
 Actually... 
 Hmm? 
 I don't know. I've been thinking a lot about it ever since he kidnapped me, and... 
 I'm gonna go with the fame and fortune. 
 Yes! 
 Seems like an easier life, you know? 
 Oh, I'm really sorry, Gal. I hope we can be friends. 
 [Groans] 
 Mm. 
 Hold that thought, darling. 
 Mm. 
 Good night, sweet prince. 
 [Tap] Oh. 
 [Scoffs] Damn it, Gareth. 
 Would you just do that for me, please? 
 Night-night. 
 Good morning... sir. 
 [Groans] 
 I see we're getting an early start this morning. 
 Oh, what do you want, Sid? 
 Sir... when you hired me to be your squire, it was  the  most exciting thing to ever happen to me. 
 Mm. 
 Best squireship in the land. 
 My parents completely plotzed. 
 But ever since Madalena... 
 Don't  say her name. 
 Right. 
 There's someone here to see you. 
 She brings with her an opportunity. 
 I would beg you to meet with her. 
 Sid, I'm not seeing anyone. 
 And here she is... may I present the Princess Isabella Maria Lucia "Elisabeeta"... 
 "Betta." 
 ...Betta of Valencia. 
 [Sighs] Well, that's a mouthful. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Inhales sharply] Sir Galavant, I have traveled long and far to seek your favor. 
 Four months ago, my peaceful kingdom of Valencia... 
 I'm sorry. What is that smell? 
 That would be me. [Sighs] 
 Four months ago, my peaceful kingdom of Valencia fell under attack from a rival land. 
 [Groans] 
 My people were taken captive. 
 My entire family either killed or imprisoned. 
 Oh, that's terrible. That's just terrible. 
 Still, you've got a nice way about you. 
 I'm sure you'll land on your feet. 
 Nice meeting you. Door's on the wall. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Before being captured, my father hid me in the cellar and handed me the priceless Jewel of Valencia. 
 I hid in that cellar for months as my family was slaughtered above me. 
 I now offer you this priceless jewel, all that my country has left to offer. 
 I throw myself at your mercy, Sir Galavant! 
 Please... 
 Save my people. 
 [Sighs] 
 Sorry. I got distracted. 
 What did you say after I said, "nice meeting you. Door's on the wall"? 
 You're no hero. Who are you? 
 Oh, I'm nobody, princess.

 Princess Isabella Maria Lucia "Elisabeet... " Bet... 
 Princess? 
 Jester : Banana. 
 Banana who? 
 Banana. 
 Banana who? 
 Orange. 
 Orange who? 
 "Orange" you glad I didn't say "banana" again? 
 [Laughs] 
 [Bells jingle] Whoa! 
 Another wonderful routine, Jester. 
 I'm not seeing it, baby. 
 Perhaps his humor flies over your head, then. 
 Honestly, Gareth, I don't know what she sees in him. 
 No idea, My King. 
 Well, I will go and compliment the Jester. 
 [Clears throat] 
 And while I do, husband, perhaps you can make some progress convincing the king and queen of Valencia to tell you where their jewel is hidden. 
 I've tried everything. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Galavant would   not  stand for this. 
 What did you just say? 
 I  said, 
 "Galavant would not have stood for this"! 
 See, that's what I thought you said. 
 I just wanted clarification. Thank you. 
 Find me the jewel, would you, dear? 
 Of course, darling. 
 Jester, um... 
 Join me in my chamber, would you? 
 I'd love to learn a little more about how you, uh... craft a joke. 
 Ooh! 
 She really gets a kick out of that damn Jester. 
 I don't know. Maybe it  is  all going over my head. 
 Oh, it's definitely going over your head, sir. 
 [Clattering] 
 [Lid creaks] 
 A midday snack, My King? 
 Come up here. 
 What happened to the other chef? 
 Looked just like you, but... older, more wrinkly. 
 My father? 
 Right. What happened to him? 
 You had him killed, sir. 
 Hmm? 
 Your mutton was too rare. 
 Well, that doesn't sound like me. 
 You killed his father before him. 
 Your family has killed the last four generations of chefs in my family. 
 It's not a great job, My King. 
 I'm such a bully. 
 I'm under a terrible amount of pressure. You  have  to understand that. 
 Oh, it's fine, My King. Don't worry about it. 
 Oh, Gareth, I try so hard to please her. 
 I invade a kingdom for a jewel, I respect her vow of chastity, and yet every day I have to hear it over and over again.

 This is all very exciting, My King, but Galavant still lives. 
 And he is still the greatest warrior in five kingdoms. 
 Fine. If I can't win her love, I'll buy it. 
 Bring me the king and queen of Valencia. 
 I'll find her that stupid jewel. 
 "'Orange' you glad I didn't say 'banana' again?" 
 Not funny at all, sir. 
 [Fingers snap] 
 Galavant : Tommy. 
 Tommy. Tommy! 
 There appears to be a rather large hole in my bucket, and I would very much like you to fix it. 
 Sorry, Gal. I'm gonna have to cut you off. 
 Tommy, come on. It's me. 
 It's Gal. 
 Hey, Gal. Come on. You're embarrassing yourself. 
 I'm embarrassing   yourself. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Thud] 
 [Men snicker] 
 Can I buy you a drink? 
 No! 
 Good. You can buy  me  one. 
 Now, where were we? 
 Two months ago, you were imprisoned in a cellar. 
 Then what happened? 
 King Richard : Ah, here we are. 
 Regular spots, please. Thank you very much. 
 I believe you know where to stand. 
 Now, let me ask you   one  question. I've tried to be kind to you. 
 Have I not? 
 You pillaged our peaceful kingdom, killed half our army. 
 But I haven't killed  you. 
 I mean, think about it. 
 I've killed a massive amount of people this week, but I haven't [Coughs] killed... kil... 
 Gareth, I have a horribly scratchy throat. 
 A bit of tea, please. 
 Tea for the king! 
 I'm not really a yeller. 
 I've been fighting a bug since the invasion. 
 I swear, it's the plague. It's not the plague. 
 Feel it, though... does that feel lumpy? 
 No. 
 You didn't even feel it. 
 We beg you to show mercy to our people, good King Richard. 
 [Chuckles] We've  done  this. 
 Look, here's the thing. 
 My wife  really  wants that jewel of yours. 
 Now, I know, at times, she can come off as a bit, um... 
 [Inhales sharply] What's the word? 
 Evil. 
 Cruel. 
 No, that's not it. It's more... 
 Sadistic. 
 Vicious. 
 You know, I think you really just have to get to know her. 
 She can be a [Bleep] 
 Would you stop it, Gareth?! 
 All right. 
 How's about this? 
 You tell me where the jewelry is, we'll pack up shop. 
 We'll stop the pillaging and the killing, yada, yada, and everyone's happy. 
 The Jewel of Valencia is priceless. 
 I know. I know. 
 It is a symbol of Valencia. It has belonged not to us, but to our people for thousands of years. 
 Totally understand. Totally empathize. 
 Can I have it? 
 Never! 
 [Sighs] 
 This is so not how I wanted to do this! 
 It is about to get very messy in here. 
 Ooh, my tea! Thank you very much. 
 Mm. 
 Is there lemon in there? 
 Yes... My King? 
 Some unsqueezed lemons. 
 Well, it's delightful. Just delightful. 
 [Sighs] 
 Kill the king, make her watch. 
 No! 
 [Woman gasps] 
 Mmm. 
 Mmm. [Lips smack] 
 Sid, fetch me a drink. 
 When he tells me to fetch, those are my favorite moments. 
 Thanks again for the drink. 
 Drinks. 
 Right. Thanks again. 
 My father used to tell stories of you, of your skill in battle... 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
 Your heroism, of your goodness. 
 What happened to you? 
 I mean... eh. 
 Oh, come on. I've come a long way. 
 Surely I deserve some kind of backstory. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 All right. [Inhales deeply] 
 My parents were people of massive, massive appetites. 
 They loved everything... they loved food. They loved drink. 
 But most of all, they loved each other. 
 Ironically, they also hated each other. 
 [Clears throat] And they fought violently every day. 
 Didn't have time for much else, in fact. 
 So... at the age of 8, I swore off love. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Devoted myself to doing something better with my life than wasting it on love. 
 So I read, I trained, I learned languages. 
 All the time other young men chasing spent chasing girls, I spent that time bettering myself. 
 But I come from a long family of lovers. 
 You can't fight genetics. 
 So when it inevitably happened... 
 When I fell... 
 You fell hard. 
 I fell hard. 
 And her? 
 [Squeaks] 
 She fell softer... 
 As it turns out. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, I'd love to help. Really, I would. 
 But I'm... 
 I'm sort of out of the whole "damsel in distress" business at the moment, so... 
 I listened from below as he ordered my parents to their death. 
 And after coming all this way, your advice is for me to just turn a blind eye and watch king Richard destroy my kingdom and everyone I've ever loved? 
 What? 
 Did you just say... 
 "King Richard"? 
 Oh, come here! 
 Isabella. 
 Father! 
 Ah! 
 Maybe  this  is what we're looking for. 
 Ooh, sweet! 
 Any luck on the Jewel, Richard? 
 Well, actually, my dear... 
 I know. I know. You're working on it. 
 Well, why don't you stop working on it, start acting like Galavant, and  do something  already? 
 Will do, My Queen. 
 [Sighs] 
 I swear, if I have to hear the name Galavant one more time. 
 If only there was some way that I could... 
 Ah. 
 She's a pretty young thing, isn't she, Gareth? 
 A bit plump for my liking. 
 Plump? 
 The girl is 100 pounds soaking wet. 
 I know, but I like skinny. Like, really unhealthy skinny. 
 [Sighs] 
 You love your parents, don't you, my dear? 
 Leave my parents be. 
 Leave them be, or so help me, I will kill you myself. 
 And spunky. 
 Ha! More like "chunky"! 
 Just stop it, Gareth! 
 I am trying to do something here! 
 Fine. If we can't beat Galavant on his turf, we'll bring him to our own. 
 If you want your parents to live, you will travel to find Galavant. 
 You tell him that I, king Richard, have invaded your kingdom. 
 Offer to pay him with the jewel. 
 When that doesn't work, I want you to tell him this... 
 I feel like you should be writing this down. 
 I will remember it. 
 It's a bit long. 
 I'd really just be more comfortable if you wrote it down. 
 I will remember it. 
 Like a steel trap. 
 Always had a wonderful memory, this one. 
 Fine. 
 You tell him that king Richard is a... 
 Is a cruel and vicious man. 
 Four months I hid in that cellar. 
 He and his queen slept right above me. 
 And you tell him that every night, you would listen while he screamed at his queen... 
 Screamed at his queen, and each night I would be left with only the sobs of that poor woman. 
 Every night, she would cry out, "I made the wrong choice. 
 I'm so sorry, Gals. I'm so sorry." 
 She must have left some maidens back home. 
 Never knew what she meant. 
 "I'm so sorry, Gals." 
 [Echoing] I love you, Gal. 
 "I'm so sorry, Gal." 
 She was saying, "I'm so sorry, Gal." 
 We leave tomorrow at sunrise. 
 Pack lightly. There's a long journey ahead.
