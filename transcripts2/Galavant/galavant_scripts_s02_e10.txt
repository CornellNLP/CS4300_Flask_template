 Make way for your king Richard, swine! 
 Thanks, Gareth. 
 Hi, everyone. I'd like to swing now.

 Isn't your king impressive?

 Ta-da! 
 Your king made a sand castle. Praise him! 
 Greatest castle ever, My King. 
 You're my hero, My King. 
 Would you like me to write you a theme song, My King? 
 Shut up, Menken. 
 Applause! 
 [Applause] 
 Enough! 
 They cheer because I'm king and because they're scared, not because of anything I do. 
 Your king had a realization. 
 Cheer his realization! 
 Yay. 
 I'm no hero. 
 I'm a phony.

 Galavant - S02E10 - Season Finale The One True King (To Unite Them All) 
 Sid : Hello?! 
 Anyone in there?! 
 That depends on who it is. 
 'Tis I, Sid of Sidneyland! 
 Sid? 
 Why are you talking so weird? 
 I was trying something, and it didn't work! 
 Can you open up the gate?! It's pretty intense out here! 
 Oh, fine. Open the gate. 
 Sid! 
 We broke through their lines. 
 We can't hold them forever. 
 Sid, what are you doing here? 
 After I ran off, I went in search of an army so I could redeem myself for accidentally killing you. 
 Wait. What? 
 You know, it's really hard to find one. 
 Oh, tell me about it. 
 No kidding. 
 But then I wandered into the Enchanted Forest for a drink, not knowing it was a... you knew. 
 You knew. 
 He knew. 
 Yeah, I knew. 
 When they heard that Galavant needed help, they took up arms. 
 And so did the pirates and the Dwarves and Giants. 
 And Princess Jubilee's entourage did the same thing. 
 And they didn't even know you. [Chuckles] 
 I-is the pirate king with you? I love that guy. 
 Yeah, we... We couldn't afford him or the leader of the Giants or Jubilee or really anyone else recognizable. 
 You saved us all. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Well done, Sid. 
 Right. It's time to do this. 
 With the extra numbers, we should be able to turn the tide. 
 Gareth, you and I are gonna go through the center and try and draw Wormwood and Madalena's attention. 
 Isabella, take Richard on horseback and flank them. 
 Then we'll meet you on the hillside. 
 And I promise... After this, I'll never leave your side again. 
 Ah, someone's daughter's gonna get a little woop-woop tonight. 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 I honestly have no idea. 
 Everybody... 
 Let's move out!

 Please stop. We already sang that one. 
 Sorry. It's just ridiculously catchy. 
 And I don't care about anyone else. 
 Gareth does not get hurt. 
 Very well, My Queen. 
 Random thought... There's some very vicious-looking weapons in the armory. 
 Now that you're the dark queen, why don't you go and pick on out? 
 Give you that... iconic look. 
 And do you promise that Gareth will be fine? 
 Ooh, pinkie swear. 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 Yes.

 You know when you presume, you make a "pres" out of "u" and "me." 
 Sorry, what... What does that mean? 
 Not sure. 
 Care to dance? 
 Love to. 
 Excellent. 
 Let's be clear, right? 
 When you say "dance," you mean "fight." You don't really want to dance. 
 Correct... fight, not dance. 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry, d-did you want to dance? 
 No. Ri... Come on, kind of weird. 
 You know, sorry. This face-off isn't going great. 
 Would mind if we started over?

 Not. 
 No, I don't.

 It is? 
 Yes. Pity, you're going to die. 
 Well, we'll see about that. 
 Aah!

 Just four.

 Good man! Get him! 
 You killed my dragon. 
 Look, dude, I was there. I know. 
 Don't keep saying it. 
 And it wasn't a dragon. It was a lizard. 
 Oh, nuggets. 
 Aah! 
 [Screams] 
 It's the one true king! 
 Crazy. 
 That's the same guy who cried when he got jelly on his fancy pants. 
 I just said that. I said that exact thing. 
 Sure, 'cause that's what's amazing right now.

 I mean, who else could do this? 
 Huh? 
 Wait, what?! 
 What?! 
 Oh, my... 
 Pretty freakin' cool, huh? 
 Yeah! 
 Listen, I need you to take care of Tad Cooper for me. 
 What? 
 There's something I need to do. 
 No, no, no, hang on. 
 I'm not looking after the lizard. 
 He's a dragon! Hyah!

 Come on. 
 Oh, I don't need your help! 
 Maddie, stop. 
 Let's just put it all behind us and move on. 
 I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 Because I love you. 
 And I promise you we can spend the rest of our lives together being terrible, even if we're not as totally terrible as you want. 
 It's too late for me. 
 I've tasted ultimate power, and I want more.
