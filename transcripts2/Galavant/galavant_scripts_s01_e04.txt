 Galavant : Behold, my fellow travelers. Today, we cross the winding straits to the rocky river to the shores of Valencia. 
 No, I wouldn't take the rocky river route. There are rumors of thieves and bandits. 
 I don't care about bandits. I'm Galavant, and Galavant will be deterred by no foe in his... 
 Who ate all the raisins out of the trail mix? 
 I hate cashews, and Brazil nuts are gross. 
 You know what? 
 Heroes get the raisins. And they choose the path. 
 That's just the way it goes. 
 Look, can we just hold it together for a few more days? 
 We've been doing so well, right? 
 Right. 
 Right.

 I thought you said I was gonna have the big finish this time. 
 It was supposed to be my turn afterwards. 
 It's never your turn. 
 Well, no, that's... 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Bandits. 
 If only someone had warned us. 
 Yeah, well, you snore.

 Galavant - 01x04 
"Comedy Gold" 
 I've got something else you can do with your hands. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 I cannot believe My Queen is cheating on me with that joker. 
 He's a jester, sir. 
 I know he's a jester, Gareth. 
 I was insulting him by calling him a joker, like when you call someone a clown. 
 But people like clowns. 
 Damn it, man! Would you just let me vent?! 
 I think I know why Madalena likes him more than me. 
 [Both laugh] He's funny. 
 How do I compete with that? 
 Well, funny's easy. I mean, I'm funny. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Knock, knock. 
 Who's there? 
 He's a [Bleep] you [Bleep] thing up [bleep] you in the [Bleep] chair with the [Bleep] and knees [bleep] is taking it [Bleep] out that son [Bleep] 
 Good Lord, Gareth. 
 Do you kiss my ring with that mouth? 
 My mum taught me that one. 
 Oof. 
 [Laughs] 
 Now, if that fool is tickling my wife's funny bone, it leaves me no choice. 
 I know what I have to do. 
 Hello, jester. 
 Do you think I'm an idiot? 
 I know precisely what you have been doing with my wife. 
 Aah! 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughing] It's a bendy sword. 
 Isn't that fantastic? 
 Oh! 
 Not even a giggle. 
 See, this is precisely why I need your help. 
 Please teach me to be funny. 
 I'm begging you. 
 Gah! 
 Ohh! 
 Oh! 
 Aah! 
 [Laughs] Even when you know it bends, you still think... whoa! 
 [Gasps] [Laughs] 
 Please tell me you hid the jewel. 
 Of course I hid the jewel... 
 In a place where no one will ever find it. 
 Uh, excuse me. Where are you taking us? 
 The pirate king will decide your fate. 
 "I don't care what road we choose. I'm Galavant. [Mockingly] I get to eat the raisins." 
 [Mockingly] "I'm Isabella. I chew with my mouth open like a cow working on a fresh cud." 
 I have a deviated septum. I told you that. 
 I can't breathe through my nose. 
 If I chew with my mouth closed, I'd get no air. 
 Do you want me to die? 
 Well... 
 Wait. What are pirates doing miles from the ocean? 
 [Man wolf-whistles] 
 I'm... so sorry. Am I missing something? 
 Where's your boat? 
 I'll be asking the questions around here. 
 All : Arr! 
 Actually, go ahead. 
 I didn't have a question ready. 
 Um... don't you need a boat to be pirates? 
 You're on land. 
 Land ho! 
 Carl, stop it. 
 All you need to be a pirate is a dark heart and a wicked disregard for other people's lives. 
 And swords. 
 [Scoffs] Of course swords. That goes without saying. 
 Everyone knows pirates need swords. 
 What about a hook hand? 
 Parrots? Peg legs. 
 Land ho! 
 I said stop it! 
 Maybe it'll be easier to explain in a pirate shanty.

 [Growling] 
 So, now we live here, and we rob any passers-by. Which brings us back to you. 
 Please, sir. We're merely poor travelers with nothing worth taking. 
 Hey, captain. Look what I found. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, for the love of g... in your purse? 
 That's where you thought no one would look for it? 
 I put it with my girls' supplies. 
 Guys never look there. They must have sisters. 
 [Sighs] 
 Poor travelers, huh? Well, what do we have here? 
 It's a jewel. 
 I know it's a jewe... you know what? 
 You're having a time-out. Go to your tent. 
 Don't you give me that look. 
 Right. Comedy lessons. Let's begin. 
 [Bells jingling] 
 I'm sorry. What is that noise? 
 It's my bells, sire. I'm terrified. 
 Don't be. 
 I already told you I've decided not to kill you. 
 I mean, not that I don't want to. 
 In fact, it would be mondo satisfying to cut your face off and sew it back on inside out. 
 [Jingling continues] 
 [Jingling stops] 
 Nah, I'll stick with my first plan. 
 Teach me to be funny so I can woo my wife.

 Pirates, that's pomade. 
 It's for relaxing my curls, not eating. 
 [Sighs] 
 Right, men. 
 Let's stow this booty in the chest. 
 Carl, give me the key. 
 Oh, come on, guys. Not again. 
 These idiots really stink at being pirates. 
 No kidding. 
 Unbelievable. 
 It's kind of nice being on the same page, isn't it? 
 It is nice to have a break from the relentless stream of criticism, yeah. 
 Maybe if you did things right, I wouldn't have to say it. 
 Mouth breather. 
 Egomaniac. 
 And it's over. 
 You. Walk with me. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Oh, right. Of course. 
 Lads, could you give me a hand? 
 All : Arr. 
 You know, we met before, at Lilith Faire, the island of Lesbos. 
 I looked a little different... Fewer wrinkles. 
 More like... 
 Yes, of course. 
 Well, you're Peter Pillager, the pirate king. 
 Well, your men used to be the scourge of the seas. 
 [Sighs] 
 What happened there? 
 Oh. 
 You know how it is when you spend too much time with people. 
 Little things start to get to you... 
 Oh... 
 And before you know it, it's all about who's taken whose booty. 
 "It's my booty." "No, it's my booty." booty, booty, booty. 
 You stopped working together. 
 Big-time. 
 We can't even agree on how to get our ship off that damn hill. 
 The truth is... I could do with a man like you. 
 So I have a proposition. 
 Either, "A," I kill all of you and keep that jewel and the girls' supplies. 
 Why do you want the girls' supplies? 
 Or "B," you join me and I let your squire and that annoying little mouth breather go. 
 Well, in all fairness to her, only 'cause she's not here to defend herself, the mouth breathing is a medical condition, so she can't really help it. 
 Seems like a pretty simple fix to me. 
 Put food in mouth, close mouth, chew. 
 What kind of moron can't do that? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Again, not to get into semantics here, but if she closes her mouth while she eats, she's literally not breathing out of anywhere. 
 You get used to it. 
 Honestly, lately, I can't fall asleep until she starts snoring. 
 Dude, you're making me uncomfortable. 
 Who are you choosing, me or the mouth breather? 
 Call her a "mouth breather" one more time. 
 Mouth breather. 
 How did you do that? 
 I keep trying to tell everyone... 
 Oh. 
 I'm not just the guy that eats the raisins. 
 [Gasps] 
 Chef : Excuse me, excuse me. 
 Chef coming through. Thank you. This way, my lady. 
 Here's your table, My Queen. 
 What fresh idiocy does king Richard have in store for me now? 
 Um, I'm... 
 That was rhetorical. Shoo. 
 Chef out. 
 [Thudding] 
 Welcome to the show! 
 I introduce to you, without further ado, the king of comedy! 
 Hello! Thank you very, very, very much. 
 Now, I understand you've all come here under threat of death, and I appreciate it. 
 In fact... I ordered it. 
 Everybody laugh! 
 [Laughter] 
 What on God's flat earth is going on? 
 Well, they say the way to a woman's heart is through her funny bone, so... 
 Oh, God. Let's not do this. 
 Why did the king go to the dentist? 
 To get his teeth crowned. 
 To get his teeth crowned. Uh, you've heard that one. 
 Mm! "You might be a peasant" jokes. 
 If you have more children than teeth, you might be a peasant. 
 Is this thing on? [Pops] 
 Ugh. He's dying out there. Give him the pie. 
 Now?! 
 That's the big finale. 
 Damn it, man, look at the poor b*st*rd. 
 Give him the pie. 
 If your toilet is a tree, then you might be... 
 [Laughter] 
 She laughed! It worked! She laughed! 
 Quick, give me more pies so I can keep hitting Gareth in the face. 
 Or someone else. I-I can pie someone else. 
 You're a fool. 
 When my men see me captive, they will swarm on you like hornets. 
 No. Bees. 
 No, hornets was better. 
 Well, you can let them try, but I'll be damned if I'm letting my team end up like yours. 
 So I'm gonna rescue them, rouse us to work together, defeat your... hold on. 
 Oh, for the love of Mike, what happened? 
 [Sighs] Sid was right. 
 It was time to stop bickering and work together. 
 So we did, and we overthrew the camp. 
 You missed an amazing battle, better than anything at castle black. 
 Well, FYI, I was also gonna come back, and I was gonna suggest that we start working together, too, wasn't I? Tell them. 
 Oh, please, stop. 
 This whole time, I've been saying that I was gonna... 
 This is all a little humiliating. 
 You know what? Doesn't matter. 
 I know we've been driving each other crazy, but I think we've got something really good going on here. 
 I mean, look at us... We're gorgeous, very diverse. 
 I think if we pull it together, we could do something great, legendary even. 
 What do you say? 
 We are diverse. 
 Super diverse. 
 I remember when we had something special. 
 All : Arr. 
 I miss us. 
 Now, look, either we can take your pirate supplies... 
 The swords, the hooks... 
 Parrots. 
 Booty. 
 Peg legs. 
 Girls' supplies. 
 Yes, yes, all of it, or we can work together to get your ship off that hill and you can take us to Valencia. 
 What do you say? 
 Did I just cut your hand? 
 Yes. Very badly. 
 Sorry. 
 Where are you going? 
 It's time for 4:00 fool-around. 
 Is it? 
 M-my sundial must be slow because of the... c-clouds. 
 If you're worried I'm upset about you helping my husband with that ridiculous show, then don't be. 
 Who cares? He's an idiot. 
 Yes, well, that's the thing. 
 I don't think I can do this anymore. 
 I guess I just feel a little... guilty. 
 Well, that's very noble of you to care about someone's feelings. 
 Guards! 
 If you're developing a conscience, then you're no good to me. 
 Take him to the dungeon, the really scary one. 
 With the mice. 
 Wait, no! Please! 
 At least let me change my clothes! 
 These are gang colors! 
 Oh, hello. 
 I was just coming to see Steve. 
 Who's Steve? 
 Steve McKinzie. The jester. 
 You don't know his name? 
 Well, no matter. 
 Say, what do you call a tiny mosquito in a tin suit? 
 Oh, God. 
 Nope. 
 A  gnat  in shining armor. 
 [Chuckles] I've got so many of these. 
 Please stop talking. 
 [Laughing] No, I love talking with you. 
 Right, you maggots! 
 Let's get this boat off the hill. 
 What? 
 It's just nice to hear you call us "maggots" again. 
 You've always been maggots in here.

 "Land ho," indeed, Carl. 
 [Sighs] 
 Gal... 
 Can I call you "Gal"? 
 Uh, well, I don't love it. 
 [Sighs] I have to talk to you. 
 I feel a little guilty about something. 
 Actually, so do I. 
 I stashed a bag of trail mix before we left. 
 Raisins intact. 
 [Chuckles] Really? 
 Knock yourself out. 
 And feel free to eat with your mouth open. 
 It's not as gross as I make it out to be. 
 I mean, it's gross, but it's not gross-gross. 
 Listen, Galavant, I think the reason I've been so difficult recently is that I was villainizing you so I felt better about myself. 
 I'm probably signing my parents' death warrant by telling you this, but... 
 I lied. 
 I'm leading you into a trap. 
 Galavant? 
 We're almost there. 
 Did you hear anything I just said? 
 Sorry. 
 I don't always listen when you talk. 
 I will get better in that. 
 *** 
 Your parents or something? 
 I look foward to see them. 
 Right. Yeah, parents are the best. 
 *** 
 To Valencia! 
 All : Arr! 
 I'm coming, my love.
