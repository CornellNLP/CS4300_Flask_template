 Pirates! 
 Soon we will come ashore, and I will return Richard to his home kingdom... 
 And rescue Isabella from... 
 Ohh, god, I do not feel good! 
 Is there a name for when you throw up through your nose? 
 Oh, please try and keep it together. 
 We're almost there. 
 And it's called "snarfing." 
 "Almost there." 
 You've been saying that for weeks. 
 [Grunts] 
 Listen, I'm tired. 
 I miss Gareth. 
 These pirates smell horrible. 
 [Pirates sniffing] 
 Sing me the song, Galavant. 
 It's the only thing that'll make me feel better. 
 If I sing you the song, will you shut up? 
 [Quickly] ♪ Way back in days of old, there was a legend to... ♪ 
 Oh, do it for real! 
 ♪ About a hero known as Gala... ♪ 
 Sorry to interrupt. It's a very catchy tune and all that.

 Wait. I know this area. 
 There... that is the safest place to come ashore. 
 You're certain? 
 I've never been more certain of anything in my life. 
 [Men coughing] 
 [Chuckling] Wow! 
 I do not know what I was talking about... 
 Not even a little. 
 Galavant - S02E01 
A New Season aka Suck It Cancellation bear 
 Hear ye! Hear ye! 
 Presenting the queen and the guy that was with the queen when she killed the other guy who was kind of the king! 
 Maybe later we can discuss my title. 
 And what trifling business is before the court today? 
 My queen, my guy who was with the queen when she... 
 Get on with it. 
 A chicken laid an egg on the border between our two properties. 
 We didn't know what to do, so we just let it sit there. 
 But then this chicken hatched from that egg, and... and now we don't know who the new chicken, um, belongs to. 
 Is this for real? Is this really happening? 
 I got this. 
 I think what we need to consider here is what came first. 
 We have a chicken, and there was an egg. 
 But then before that, there was another chicken. 
 Kill the chicken. I'll eat it for dinner. 
 Next! 
 My queen. 
 My guy who was with the queen wh... 
 Oh, get on with it. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I guess I just have a few questions about my situation here. 
 Am I captive? 
 Am I free? How's my hair? 
 I mean, I haven't seen a mirror in weeks. 
 Perhaps you'd like to go the way of the chicken. 
 Look, I don't mean to complain. 
 I just... don't know what my role is, and that's weird. 
 Yeah. It's a bit rough not having a role. 
 You have a role, Gareth. 
 I do? 
 Go kill the chicken. 
 Honey...Since the wedding to your cousin is back on, we thought you might want to choose a cake topper. 
 You see nothing wrong with this? 
 Your only daughter is about to marry her own cousin, who happens to be an 11-year-old boy. 
 We're good with it. 
 Father! 
 Honey, Galavant is gone. 
 [Sighs] 
 He was a tall drink of water, and I will keep him forever in my spank bank, but it's time to move on. 
 No! 
 Wherever he is, Galavant will come for me, and then we will marry. 
 If you marry Galavant, I have to pay for the whole wedding. 
 You marry your cousin, I only do the rehearsal dinner. 
 True love is not about rehearsal dinners! 
 You haven't seen the Farkakte bill. 
 You are marrying your cousin. 
 I can't believe you two, planning this wedding as if nothing's wrong whilst I'm locked away in this prison! 
 Oh, baby Bella, honey, we love you. 
 But you're being a tad dramatic. 
 This is not a prison. 
 [Pounding echoing] 
 Man : Visitor is coming out! 
 [Locks disengaging, doors creaking] 
 [Sighs] Where are you, Galavant? 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Well, those pirates were a bit snippy with me, no? 
 Please stop talking. 
 Are you still upset about the shipwreck? 
 Geez, man, what's the point of a bygone if it can't just be a bygone? 
 A pirate died. 
 That's what pirates do! 
 Huh. 
 I really thought I knew where we were. 
 Oh, well, my kingdom can't be too far away from here. 
 Do... oh, no. 
 What "oh, no"? 
 Oh...No. 
 "Oh, no," what? 
 I think I may have led us into the enchanted forest, and that is not good. 
 My father warned me to stay away from here at all costs. 
 There's a queen... An evil queen... 
 In fact, once my father and his best friend/camping buddy, Keith, who... I called him uncle Keith 'cause he was always around... 
 Spit it out! 
 They wandered in here, and uncle Keith was never heard from again. 
 Oh, great. 
 Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm, typical. 
 God, can't you do anything right?! 
 You just gonna keep walking? 
 Oh. 
 "Happy Hour"? 
 The enchanted forest is a pub. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 God, you actually had me scared for a minute there. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Oh, this place is fabulous! 
 It's all men, a real gentlemen's club. 
 Hello. 
 Get used to the attention, son. 
 This is what happens when you hit the mainland with king rich. 
 Haven't seen you around here before. 
 Trust me... I'd remember. 
 Jean, looks like you got some competition. 
 Oh, hello there. 
 Jean Hamm? 
 Yeah. 
 Don't tell my wife. 
 Come, Bobby. 
 The queen's gonna want to get a look at  this  one. 
 Queen : I do! 
 Oh, no.

 [Cheers and applause] 
 Put this back on. You'll catch your death. 
 Well, I have had a blast. 
 You know, I've never been to one of these places before. 
 What, a pub? Oh, don't be stupid. 
 You've been to a pub before. 
 Anyway, uh, I'm gonna head out. 
 Got to get him back to his kingdom. 
 I've got to return to saving my one true love. 
 She's, uh... 
 Aw! Aw! Aw! Aw! 
 Yeah,  she's  waiting for me, but thank you for everything. 
 And  thank you for not feeding us to the bear. 
 Goodbye, bear. 
 Laters. 
 Richard, vamos. 
 Sí. 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Uh... 
 We just had our best night in years. 
 You'll be staying here forever. 
 Or at least until those abs go soft. 
 [Chuckles] But... 
 Guards! 
 [Chuckles] 
 At least bear seems happy. 
 Oi! 
 [Water splashes] 
 Geez, gorilla! 
 Make a fist! Pound the door! It's called knocking! 
 Listen, the boss lady thinks she's the boss of me, and I'm trying to figure out if she is. 
 Now, you wanted a position. 
 Here it is... Be my assistant. 
 This is the kingdom's charter. 
 It outlines the changes of power when a king is deposed. 
 But I can't read. 
 Aww, Gareth, are you asking me to teach you to read? 
 No. Reading's for morons who can't understand pictures. 
 Just read it! 
 10 more minutes of outside time, my lady. 
 [Sighs] Yeah. Not a prison at all, mom. 
 There's my beautiful bride-to-be! 
 Jester, Jester, do it for the Princess. 
 Pbht! 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughing] Every time, he gets me. 
 Pbht! 
 Stop! I'm gonna pee myself! 
 Pbht! Pbht! 
 Oops. I did. Let me down. 
 [Chuckles] Great kid. 
 Oh, he's gonna make a wonderful husband, your cousin. 
 I mean, once he stops peeing himself. 
 [Sighs] 
 I feel like I've been drinking crazy grog. 
 How can you be happy about this? 
 You kidding? 
 This is the easiest gig I've ever had. 
 It's all fart noises and poop jokes with this kid. 
 I haven't had to write new material for months. 
 And, truth be told, it's given me time to work on my real passion. 
 I'm trying to break into drama. 
 Pbht! 
 So sorry. 
 I can't handle a moment's silence. 
 What's wrong with me? Pbht. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Chef. Gwynne. 
 Milady. 
 You two have to help me escape and find Galavant. 
 You must see how insane this all is. 
 I do hate the idea of you being forced into marriage. 
 I'm kind of big into women's rights. 
 He really is. 
 He said he's gonna let me keep our first daughter and not just throw them all out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 The guards... they ordered a lot of room service. 
 Let me see if I can't slip them some sleepy-time pie and get you a key. 
 [Exhales sharply] You're so kind. 
 One daughter! 
 Then we leave the rest to the white walkers. 
 Men. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. 
 Pardon me. Pardon me. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 Need another round of mead lights for Philip and Sebastian, please. 
 Hello? 
 Galavant! 
 Galavant? 
 [Exhales heavily] Tried to escape. 
 Made it all the way to the door, but my hands were too cold from mixing slushy drinks. 
 We are wasting time. 
 Relax, my brother from another. 
 Have a drink. Feel the beat. 
 [Chuckling] Oh, that reminds me. 
 Bear told me a ripper. 
 A bear walks into a bar... 
 Oh, you're having fun. I'm so glad because the people I care about are in real trouble. 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 I'm just trying to lighten the mood. 
 Well, stop trying. 
 The more you try, the worse it gets. 
 Just stay out of my way. 
 Fine, but from now on, we're pooling our tips! 
 Who doesn't like to hear a good bear joke? 
 Bears are funny. I'm so... 
 Uncle Keith! 
 Shh! Shh! Shh! 
 Dad said you entered the enchanted forest and never came out. 
 The other way 'round, kid. 
 Huh? 
 I  belong  here. 
 Your father... God rest his soul... 
 He  belonged  here. [Gasps] 
 Was he an alcoholic, too? 
 But you  don't  belong here. 
 I'm going to help you escape. 
 Marvelous! 
 Okay. Maybe you do belong here. 
 Oh, this is gonna be fun! 
 Why is she making us watch her eat our chicken? 
 What do you mean, "our chicken"? 
 It was my egg first. 
 It weren't. I had it first. 
 I found it! 
 This is why. 
 This is why you're watching. 
 Queenie, I need to talk to you about my title. 
 Now, I helped you overthrow a king. 
 You helped your friend escape and watched as I killed his replacement. 
 I'm sick of not being treated as an equal. 
 I'm sick of having to park my horse in the stable with the assistants! 
 Look, according to the scrolls I have had read to me, I banished the king. 
 So, technically, I am the true king of Valencia. 
 And it would really mean a lot to me if I was treated as such. 
 What is it with men and their  emotions? 
 Fine. You're king. 
 Yes! 
 Oi. Say it. 
 Man : Presenting the queen and king of Valencia! 
 Oh, you don't think... 
 We're not changing the order. 
 Nah, it's great. It's fine. 
 Psst! Hey! 
 I got us a way out of here, but you got to follow me right now. 
 We don't have much time before the music starts. 
 All right, sure. I'll listen to you... 
 Like when I listened to you about when we were gonna come ashore or maybe when I listened to you about... 
 [thud] 
 I want you to know that hurt me a lot more than it hurt you. 
 Come on. 
 Use your core, Richard. Use your core. 
 Where is my core? 
 [Groans] 
 Oh, there it is. 
 Ah, you're waking up. Excellent. 
 Good morning, sunshine. 
 Aah! Ow! 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm rescuing us. 
 What, through the ladies room? 
 This is your dumb plan? 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 The bar needed a ladies room built to be up to code, but no one was ever going to use it, so they didn't bother to finish it. 
 [Chuckles] You know you just... 
 Saved the day? 
 Yeah. 
 I know. 
 I can't take all the credit. 
 Galavant, I want you to meet my Uncle Keith. 
 Galavant. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 We are indebted to you, Uncle, forever and always. 
 It's nothing. 
 Are you certain we can't convince you to come with us? 
 No, son. My Destiny is here. 
 Destiny, this is Richard. Richard, Destiny. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Man : Galavant! 
 Man #2 : Galavant! 
 You must go now! 
 I'll miss you. 
 Godspeed. 
 Let's boogie! 
 Hello. 
 Yeah. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Hey! 
 This is a silly question. 
 Do you think my Uncle Keith might be... 
 Yes, Richard. 
 Wow. 
 You think Destiny knows? 
 You know what? I owe you an apology 'cause you really came through for us today. 
 Thank you. 
 I know you don't think much of me, and I know I screw everything up all the time, but you have to understand, I was coddled my entire life. 
 I know. 
 I was breastfed until I was 9. 
 I kno... wait. What? 
 I had a nanny named Pearl... 
 No, I don't want to know. 
 The point is, today's a new day. 
 This is a new chapter in your life. 
 You got to find your inner king. 
 You really think so? 
 I do.
