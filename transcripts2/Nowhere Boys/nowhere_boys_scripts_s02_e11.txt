 Ten years ago, you cast a spell to get me magic and you got stuck... nowhere! 
 It would be different this time - I know how to do it. 
 If I said yes, how would it work? 
 Ley lines are invisible lines around the world of... 
 Of mystical significance. Exactly. 
 They all disappeared along this ley line. 
 Roland saw Oscar running. He knows about magic! 
 We need help with a memory-wiping spell. 
 You gave them my tablet. 
 You can't risk Roland asking more questions. 
 And what if the kids do more than wipe his memory? 
 Erase and quell forever! 
 Sam, get out of the circle! 
 Oh! Oh, oh! 
 Hey. Dudes! 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 11 
 Are you OK? 
 No. I don't know. 
 That was intense. Why didn't you tell me doing magic was so full-on? 
 Did the spell affect you? 
 What spell? 
 Why would Roland have all this stuff about ley lines? 
 All of you - stop. 
 Tell me exactly what is going on. 
 Oi! 
 Deed is done - give it back. 
 What are you doing here? 
 This is a one-time-only deal. 
 (Echoes) What are you doing here? 
 This is a one-time-only deal. You can't give it to Alice. I have to - it's hers. She'll used it to stop... She made me promise. No. No, no, no, no, no - wh-what have you done? Are you sure the spell worked? Just the way we planned. What did you do? How did you do this? Calm down. It's OK. Do you remember the spell? What spell? What are you talking about? I think you got too close to Roland. Roland...? What are you talking about? I think we wiped your memory too. Come on; we need to find a way to fix this. What? Hairy fingers...? Dad's shoes...? Oh, no. Roland Victor Murphy, date of birth, 1969! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no... Ahh! Oh! Oh! You are so old...! Could we get the tablet back? You heard Phoebe - I don't think so. But we can't reverse the spell without it. Jake : Couldn't we just tell Sam what he needs to know? Fill in the blanks...? Hey, where is Sam? (Phone rings) Roberts. Roberts, you have to help me. Who is this? It's me, Detective Sergeant Murphy. Sam! Prank-calling the police station might not be the smartest thing to do, young man. I'm not. I'm... They think I'm... Hang on a minute. Long story short, this is an opportunity. Are you alright? Um... I don't know. Why don't you tell me... "guys"...? "Dudes"...? Sam as Roland : Felix! Felix! (Echoes) Seriously, dude! (Echoes) This is so not funny! Felix...? So what's the last thing you remember? The party - Andy running off. You don't remember anything after that? Not a thing. You remember the alternate universe, though, right? I could use a précis. "Précis"...? It means 'recap'. I know what it means. Since when does Sam? Er, dudes, I have a dictionary. On my phone. Anyway, back to the alternate universe stuff you mentioned. Guys, tell me more about that. You remember the school excursion? (Knocks and whispers loudly) Felix! (Knocks again) Felix! Can I ask what you're doing? Oh. Mrs Ferne. Hi. Haven't you harassed my son enough? No...?! I'd appreciate it if you left now. Um... If you see Felix, can you tell him I said hi? And that I need to see him. It's... super-urgent. You look ridiculous, by the way. The baseball cap. Oh. Who do you think you are - the hip-hop police? Oh! (Laughs) Hey, watch it! Oh, sorry, Detective. "Detective"...? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. That's me - detective. Oi! Stop right there. Er, yes? Are we doing something wrong, Detective? Yes, you are, Mia. Such as...? Well, you... you know. No. I don't. Well, you could do so much better than this... clown. Gimme your skateboard. W-why? I'm confiscating it. Why? Hey - you want a fine too? Yeah - I can fine you; I'm a detective. No, I just... Maybe a little jail time? For what? Just try me. And the helmet. Good. Now get outta here. Mia? You know I'm right, Mia. What was that all about? So maybe Andy's in another universe with dinosaurs, or something? Without a talisman we have no way of contacting him again. Right. Talisman. Where did that come from again? The other universe. It was Alice's. She doesn't have one here. Which she should, shouldn't she? There were two necklaces. Two versions of you. And two Garys. I-I'm confused. He's back! But Alice doesn't have a talisman here - that's why she was after yours. Which means, for some reason, she never had it here! And we could still find it. A second talisman... If there is a second talisman, where would we find it? Could be anywhere. Good thing we have Oscar. Oscar. Ahem. Oh...! Detective Sergeant Murphy... So, instead of looking for Andy Lau, you're learning to skateboard? No! I already know how to skateboard. What do you say to the accusations that your investigation has been incompetent? Oh, um... Sorry. That's not an answer. Sorr... Yes, it is. Hey, what are you doing? What? What are you doing? You're in shot, Sergeant. Yeah, and you're out of line. We're doing everything we can to find Andy Lau. Yeah, yeah, yeah - yeah, you tell her, Sarge. Really? So what progress have you made? Well... Hm? Well, yeah, for your information, we are, like, this close to getting Andy back. You are? We are...? Yeah - aren't we? Mm. Are you keeping information from the public, from the Lau family? (Chuckles) Do you know where Andy Lau is? Oh, now, I never said that I... You said that you were this close. What did you mean? Yeah - what did you mean? What did I mean...? What I meant is that being a detective is not easy. I got hair growing outta my ears and... and my back hurts - for no reason. And what I... what I need now is just to talk to Felix. OK? So if that's, er... if that's everything... Thank you very much. (Slams the door) Dudes...! So, according to this, it's all to do with the ley lines - the disappearances in the forest, the strange events, the magic... Where are these ley lines? I've never seen any. They're kind of like the Equator. You can't see that either. (Phone rings) Who is it? No idea. Hey. This is Felix. Speak now or forever hold your peace. Come on, Felix! I can't be Roland forever. (Phone rings) Station...? Hello? Are you... me? What are you doing at the station? Just put Felix on. Do not open your mouth. Oops. Too late. What do you mean? I only saved your bacon with that reporter chick. You talked to the press?! Chillax, dude. I totally rocked it. I highly doubt you rocked anything. Whatever. Just tell Felix he needs to change us back, like, now. Are you coming? Stay right where you are. Don't move. 
 
 (Stomach rumbles) Oh. Oh, I'm starved. See ya. I have to go. Later, gang. Yo. What did you just say? Felix : We're looking for the talisman - we need you. Er, yes. Of course. Right. Just, er... I've just got an errand to run. Errand...? Is this about Mia? Now's not the time. Er, yes. Mia. Exactly. I won't be long. Sam! Chillax, dudes - totally rocking this. What...? Meet back at my place! What did you put in that spell? You! Stay away from me. What? I know what you're capable of. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? As if you don't know. Er, I don't. (Laughs) When this is all over, you will be needing your lawyer, Miss Hartley. Well, I'll need something connected to the talisman. We don't have anything. Can you just try anyway? It's worth a shot, right? (Scoffs) (Laughs nervously) No pressure! I can't do it with all you watching. OK. We'll be over here. Why are you always looking at that stuff? Ley lines are lines of powerful magic. The places where they intersect are the most powerful of all. What is it, Osky? Sorry. All I've done is draw the talisman again. The lines on the talisman! They're the same pattern as the ley lines. What does that mean? Hang on. Let me try something. The talisman and the ley lines are connected. How? All we have to do is line them up. They're a map. That's the altar in the forest. That's what made the unmaking spell work that first time. That's the school. And what's this one? Dudes - skating here took forever. (Pants) Roberts, where's Murphy? Excuse me...? I need to see him now. First off, you need a lesson in how to address a police officer. Get over it, Roberts. This is an emergency. What sort of emergency, exactly? I am Murphy. I mean I'm Murphy stuck in this kid's body. That was you on the phone... That's what I'm trying to tell you. Pretending to be Detective Murphy. I'm not pretending. I... Look, long story short, is he here or not? Why do you keep saying that? Saying what? It's annoying enough when Detective Murphy says it. It is? Take a seat. I'll make a call. Dudes, I am telling you - I'm Sam! Inside this saggy, wrinkly, really unbelievably gross body, I am Sam! Prove it. Ask me anything. Something only Sam would know. What does Sam know?! I know plenty! I know that when we were in the other universe, your mum was married to Bates, you were in love with Andy and you refused to wash. So we didn't erase your memory? No! You swapped us! This is not good. Oh, finally! If you're Sam - and Sam is Roland, then we just told Roland everything. Thanks. Your mum is coming to get you as soon as she can. My mum...? Roberts, this is ridiculous - I'm a grown man. I thought I knew everything when I was your age too. I'm older than you! What happened to you boys when you went missing? Is that what's causing all of this? That is what I am this close to finding out. (Alarm sounds) Wait here. Sam! I mean, Roland. Let's go now, before Roberts comes back. This is... Weird...? This is freakier than when I saw the alternate universe me. Why are you wearing that stupid hat? (Laughs) 'Cause it looks good. Everything we told you about magic and what we can do... Are you gonna tell people? Because if you do... We could make Roland here walk through town with his underpants on his head. Yeah. I could do that. Then it's goodbye career. I won't tell - if you fix this. Yeah, we're working on that. The talisman is most likely to be at a place of magical power. Detective! It's Viv. Ellen, put the map away. Yes, Vivian? Not you! You're Roland. Oh, yeah. Um... Hi, Viv. What are you doing here with them? Well, I... You gave them my research? No. No, it... It wasn't me. Why are you lying? Viv, I... You, don't talk to me. I can't believe you're on their side! We have to tell her the truth. If we get her brother back - that'll be better than the truth. You know this is trespassing, right? I'm an officer of the law. Er, technically, I am. Either way. Do you want your bodies back or don't you? Both : Yes. Trespass it is. Bates! What's he doing here? Weekend science club - it starts in an hour. I used to go - to meet girls. Alright, let's check the plans. Great idea, dude. Don't tell me you're BFFs now. So what are we looking for? I don't know, exactly. Hiding place for the talisman. That tracing you made... Doesn't work. But this one might. I will not ever get used to this... What? Smart Sam. Standing right here. (Laughs) Fits perfectly. Which makes the intersection the... woodwork room. I spent two years in this room. I never saw any talisman. Two years? You failed woodwork? Shelves are tricky. (Laughs) Let's stay on task, shall we? If I were a talisman, where would I hide? Is there anything that doesn't belong? Anything out of place? Everything's out of place. It's a mess. Check this. No-one used this thing, not once in two years. Don't even know what it does. It's a hand drill. So why is it stuck to the wall? Try twisting it. Do it again. I'm so taking woodwork next year. Dust. Cobwebs... I don't think anyone's been here for a while. These books are filled with magic I've never even heard of. Hey - don't nerd out on me now, dude. Somebody at this school was a very powerful witch. And they know about ley lines. Look all over. Could be anywhere. Is this meaningful? It's an altar. Same as the forest. ___ Why here? Scrying pool doesn't lie. What are they looking for? Another talisman. Isn't that a bad thing? No. It's an opportunity. Talisman is close. I can feel it. (Makes game show 'wrong' noise) Dude! This is it. So we can swap back to our old bodies with that thing? Yes! Goodbye floppy underarm pits. Listen, I'm a bit tired of the old man gags. Hello! And I'm not tired of being the old man? This has got to stop. First we have to activate it. Elements we call together, erase and quell forever. Elements we call together, erase and quell forever! Oh! Oh... (Chuckles) I'm me! (Laughs) And I am most certainly not you. What have you been doing to me? (Stomach rumbles) I'm starving! Didn't you feed me? Do you think we can use the talisman to talk to Andy? With this altar... We might be able to bring him home. Elements in flux, elements unite, elements in flux, elements unite. We need to find another tear so we can find a way to get me home. What's happening?! You did this. Can you slow Alice down, get the cops onto her? Leave it with me. Hey! We use the altar to boost the communication spell - it turns a window into a door. That's brilliant. Do you guys feel that? Alice knows about the second talisman. What's she doing? Trying to stop us from reaching Andy, like she did last time. No!
