 Did you do something to Andy Lau? 
 They haven't done anything! 
 And they've got nothing to say. 
 We know it was you, Felix. 
 We need to get the police off our backs! 
 We get Andy back. 
 You say that like it's actually possible. 
 When I was lost in the forest, I thought about you. 
 So, um, are you new? 
 Mia dumped me. 
 Excuse me, I'm still your teacher, Jake. 
 Yeah, that's right, and nothing more. 
 Come here! 
 I'll be right back. 
 Those boys know something about what happened to my brother. 
 I found these in Andy's internet history. 
 If we had a real Water Element, we could do a tracking spell. 
 If there is another slightly less awesome Water Element out there, how do we find it? 
 Incoming! 
 It's OK. You're the one we're looking for. 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 5 
 Missed it. 
 That wasn't normal. 
 A girl like Saskia shouldn't have that much magical power. 
 What - more than you? 
 More than any of us. 
 How did you do it - hover that water bomb? 
 You tell me. 
 Got 'em. 
 Good! 
 This should be enough water for a tracking spell. 
 'Should'? I thought you said you knew what to do. 
 I do... kind of. 
 If it works, the water will turn into a scrying pool. 
 In English...? 
 We'll be able to see Andy and track where he is. 
 Floating water bombs and magic spells... 
 I don't know about all this. 
 You don't have to be afraid. 
 Yeah, seriously. Who doesn't want a crack at magic? 
 I guess. 
 Better get started! 
 Oh! 
 Maybe Viv's right. Maybe this needs to be a police thing now. 
 I don't even know why you're here. Didn't you just break up with Sam? 
 Look. 
 What are they doing with her? 
 Sam and Saskia...? 
 Where are you going? 
 You're right - why am I even here? 
 This is the moment of truth. Cross everything. 
 It's beautiful. 
 What is it? 
 The reason we still exist. 
 As water is to water, you will become as one. 
 As water is to water, you will find what I seek. 
 As water is to water, you will reveal and show. 
 (Knocking at door) 
 Felix, open the door! 
 Ellen! 
 Hurry up, dude! 
 Come on, Andy, where are you? 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Felix, I know you're in there! 
 How did you do that? 
 Weren't we supposed to see Andy? 
 But I followed the spell to the letter! 
 No offence, sude - but this seems like a dud to me. 
 (Door handle rattles) 
 Well, it had to mean something. Trust me, when have I let you down? 
 Um, abducted to another universe? 
 And an evil demon trying to destroy us maybe? 
 We can go on if you like! 
 Felix! Seriously, this isn't funny! 
 I'll talk to Ellen. 
 Meet at my place and we'll figure this out, OK? 
 Let's get moving. 
 Have it your way. 
 Hi, Ellen! 
 Nice of you to make an appearance! 
 Ellen! Always a pleasure. Can't stop now, though - fish emergency. 
 What were you doing in there? 
 Class assignment. 
 With the door locked? 
 These fish won't save themselves, Felix. 
 We need to find them a new home.  Pronto . 
 Are you still here? 
 Felix, I have to tell you something  in private . 
 Don't hate me. 
 I don't hate you, Felix. That would mean I care! 
 That was amazing! What else can you do? 
 Lately, nothing useful. I'm all over... 
 (Gasps) 
 Jake, are you OK? 
 I think I'm right. 
 Jake! Glad I caught you. 
 Er, can I speak with you for a sec? 
 Thanks, Saskia. 
 So, about dinner at my place tonight. 
 Dinner...? 
 Oh, awkward. Your mum said something about voicemail... 
 I'm having dinner at your place? 
 Yeah, tonight. Any requests? 
 Right, look, I don't think I can make it. I've got something on. 
 It is important to your mum, Jake, and me. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Great! See you tonight, then. 
 So, are you the teacher's pet? 
 It's complicated. 
 I guess you don't wanna talk about it. 
 How could you tell? 
 That's my other superpower. 
 (Laughs) 
 First Sam, now she's flirting with Jake? 
 She was in that room the whole time. 
 Whatever's going on with those headcases, the new girl is in on it. 
 Why would the water disappear? 
 Instead of showing you Andy? 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 (Plays chord) 
 Face it, dudes. The spell was a bust, just like Mia and me. 
 (Plays chord) 
 (Amplifier silences) 
 It had to mean something. 
 Then why did she dump me? 
 Hey! What if you made a spell that made her change her mind? 
 It doesn't work like that! 
 Dude, you owe me! 
 Everything was fine until you made us disappear into that other universe. 
 Maybe that's it. The water was supposed to show us Andy - maybe there was nothing to show, because he's not here. 
 Obviously! That's why we're looking for him. 
 I don't mean Bremin - this universe! 
 Andy's in the other universe! 
 Why not? 
 That's where Ellen liked him and where he was freakishly popular! 
 He could have used magic to go back there. 
 You could go back too with the new Element. 
 That is the worst idea ever. What if the demon is waiting for us? 
 Well, what if the demon has Andy? 
 We need to find Jake and Saskia. 
 (Mobile phone beeps, doorbell chimes) 
 Felix : Where are you? 
 You gonna turn that thing off? 
 (Mobile phone beeps) 
 How long's this gonna take? 
 I know it feels strange, but just give it a chance. 
 You two might hit it off. 
 He's my science teacher. 
 Hello! 
 Ah, welcome. 
 Oh! 
 OK, well, come in. Jake, I'll give you the grand tour. 
 No, you better give your shoes a spritz. You've got half of Bremin on them. 
 Wow, this smells fantastic. 
 Yeah, I backpacked through Italy after uni and came across this recipe in a little village there. 
 Of course, I've refined it over time. 
 Added my own little twist. 
 You knew I love Italian. 
 Did I? 
 (Mother laughs) Yes, you did. 
 I thought Thai was your favourite. 
 You can love both. 
 I make a mean green chicken curry too. 
 Mmm. 
 Jake, you have got to try this. 
 Pass. 
 Come on, Jake. 
 (Coughs) 
 Jake! 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Mother : Jake, are you alright? 
 Uh... all good! 
 Will you please come out and talk to me? 
 Just a minute. 
 Now, please! 
 (Toilet flushes) 
 Oh! Oh, Jake, you're really hot! You got an upset stomach? 
 Something's upset. 
 Everything OK? 
 No, Jake's really burning up. I'm gonna have to take him home. 
 Oh, it's probably just that 24-hour thing. It hit the school pretty hard last week. 
 Sorry, Mr... 
 Sorry, Brian. 
 Not to worry. 
 We'll do it again some other time when you're feeling up to it. 
 Sorry. 
 (Crows caw, thunder rumbles) 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 (Knocking at window) 
 Sam! 
 Dude, he's right here. 
 Oh, Felix! 
 What happened to you last night? 
 We called and texted. 
 I had to go to Bates's house. 
 Happy families. Awesome. 
 So sorry. 
 Hey, when he's your dad, do you think he's gonna give you more homework or less? 
 Could be worse. 
 How? 
 No idea, just trying to make you feel better. 
 Right, well - know what happened with the tracking spell? 
 In theory. 
 Well... 
 We think Andy might be in the other universe. 
 You can't be serious! 
 It gets better. 
 Felix wants us to go back and get him. 
 Well, I guess we've made it there and back before... 
 Yeah! OK, well, I've reworked the unmaking spell so we can travel between the universes. We'll be gone before the first class. 
 Right, well, you guys get a head start. I'll catch up. 
 What's going on? 
 This. 
 Whoa! 
 I was kind of hoping it'd go away. 
 This is magic, not man flu! 
 It's spreading! 
 OK, we have to find Saskia. 
 You're sure you can fix him? 
 Multipurpose talisman to the rescue. 
 Jake! 
 That looks terrible. 
 Thanks! 
 I didn't mean... 
 I know what you meant. 
 It's moving faster. 
 Can you walk? 
 I'm OK. 
 
 
 
 Man : Morning, gentlemen. 
 Ready to reconstruct the scene of Andy's disappearance? 
 Hmm, well, long story short - checked with your folks and they all signed off. 
 We have to get out of it. 
 Do what Roland wants. 
 Worry about me later. 
 You'd be amazed at what a site visit can do to... jog the memory. 
 Come on. 
 We'll find you. 
 So, Andy was over here next to the drinks? 
 Are we all agreed on that? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Then, what? 
 Then we kept following Andy. 
 Mmm. Details, Felix - did he walk, did he run? 
 Did he talk to someone else, hmm? 
 What about you two? What did you see? 
 Felix said that Andy grabbed his bag and ran, and then... 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Why did he take it? 
 Felix? 
 I don't know! 
 Then we followed him through there. 
 I'll show you. 
 Jake, how'd you pull up? 
 Fine. It's just one of those 24-hour things, like you said. 
 Are you sure you're on the mend? You don't look great. 
 I'm... I'm right. 
 All good. 
 OK. 
 Man : We've already searched the surrounding bushland, sir. 
 I don't see where he could have gone. 
 Something happened here. 
 Bates : How much longer is this gonna take, Detectives? 
 Has it spread any further? 
 It's up to my chest now. 
 It's hard to breathe. 
 Dude... 
 We have to get him out of here. 
 How do we do that? 
 So, Andy, he steals the bag, and then he hightails it out of here... 
 He didn't STEAL it. 
 OK, you argue and he borrows it... 
 It wasn't an argument! 
 Then what - he just vanishes and none of you saw anything? 
 Is that what I'm expected to believe? 
 We don't know what happened. 
 What about you...? 
 Nothing to say? 
 There was a lot going on. The storm... 
 We were rushing... 
 We should get back to school. 
 No. 
 No, we're going to go through the whole thing again. 
 From the start. 
 No! 
 We're not gonna find Andy like this. 
 Then why don't you tell me how we will? 
 Back to the start - now. 
 If you want to charge us, then do it, otherwise we don't have to be here! 
 People who say that usually have something to hide. 
 What are you hiding, Felix? 
 Detective, maybe we should all just calm down a little bit. 
 I'll take them back to school and we can pick this up again later. 
 Bates : See you in class, boys! 
 There she is. Let's go. 
 OK. Thanks for the lift, Mr Bates! 
 Sam : OK, OK, OK! Put you down here. 
 Are you sure the talisman can fix this? 
 It blitzes elemental attacks like nothing else. 
 Water, Fire, Earth, Air. Elements that we all share. 
 Shouldn't it be glowing? 
 Water, Fire, Earth, Air! Elements that we all share! 
 (Chokes) 
 Water, Fire... 
 The spell made it worse! 
 There has to be something else in here. 
 Nainai... 
 No magic. 
 In the other universe, Nainai cured him from a poison... 
 Well, this is more serious than a stomach-ache! 
 If the spells are speeding this up, what if one more is too much? 
 Nainai. 
 Come on. 
 Dude, you're so heavy! 
 You want help, you find my grandson. 
 Please! We'll wash up for a month! 
 You were in my house! 
 And you! 
 It was kind of a long story... 
 That we don't have time to tell. 
 Then out of my kitchen. Things to do. 
 Mrs Lau, the more of us looking for Andy, the better. 
 We need Jake. 
 OK, show. 
 Way to save the day. 
 Jake, show her. 
 (Exclaims) 
 Do you know what's causing it? 
 Silly boy! Obvious! 
 And...? 
 Too much Earth! 
 Very bad! Must fix! 
 Too much Earth - what does that even mean? 
 And how do we fix it? 
 Earth balanced by Water. 
 Go now. Must hurry! Go! Take him to water! 
 You - who are you? 
 I'm Jake's friend. 
 Too much Earth. 
 You trouble. 
 So, we need water - and a lot of it. 
 What - we just throw Jake into a river? 
 Something like that! 
 The bath at my place! 
 How do we get there? He weighs a ton! 
 The wheelbarrow! 
 Nice! 
 OK! 
 (Wheezes) 
 "Too much Earth" - I don't get it! 
 The spell, the body of water... The only thing that was different was... 
 The new Element. 
 It was you. Has to be. 
 But the spell worked! I'm the missing element... 
 I know, but what if you're not the water element? 
 She has to be magical, though, doesn't she? 
 But if she's not water... 
 Whatever she is, she's turning Jake into a giant garden gnome. 
 You're an Earth Element! 
 But you said I was Water! 
 That's what Nainai meant! If Jake had an Earth overdose, it's because there was two Earth Elements in the spell. 
 This is not her fault! 
 I'm confused. 
 If Saskia's Earth, then why did the tracking spell work? 
 I don't know, but she can't come with us. 
 I want her there. 
 Maybe I can help... 
 No way! We can't risk it. 
 I'm so sorry if this is because of me... 
 (Coughs) 
 Stop! I'm filming everything! What have you done to Jake? 
 It wasn't them. 
 Ellen, we can't do this! 
 Of course not! You've gotta take Jake somewhere in a wheelbarrow. 
 It's all part of the big secret! 
 Not now! 
 Like that magic mumbo jumbo I found in your bag - the same that Andy had on his computer? 
 You went through my bag? 
 This is no time for a lover's tiff, dude, come on! 
 (Coughs) 
 Uh, Felix? 
 What's that on his skin? 
 Nothing! 
 I'm calling the police. 
 That's not what he needs! 
 Like I trust  you! 
 Felix! 
 It's calling like before, when we did the tracking spell. 
 Ellen was outside the classroom. 
 And now the talisman's working. 
 The missing Element wasn't Saskia, it's Ellen! 
 Ellen, you're the one! 
 Back off, psycho! 
 I'm calling them. You can't stop me. 
 Water, Fire, Earth, Air. 
 You're the missing Water Element. 
 Go away! 
 Water, Fire, Earth, Air. 
 Sam, do something! The Elements need to be together! 
 She's too far away! 
 Give it back! 
 Give it back now, Sam! 
 Water, Fire, Earth, Air! 
 What are you doing?! 
 Stop being stupid, Sam! 
 Give it back! 
 Water, Fire, Earth, Air. 
 It worked. 
 Jake! Jake! 
 It's OK now. Look. 
 What is going on, Felix? You better tell me. 
 We need you to come with us to help find Andy. 
 Why would I go anywhere with you? 
 Because we'll tell you the truth about everything. 
 So, we're gonna do a spell to go to another universe. 
 From your diary. 
 The Book Of Shadows. 
 To find Andy, who got vacuumed up into a cloud when he was trying to increase his magic power? 
 Well, it was more of a twister, actually. 
 The same universe we were in when we went missing. 
 I hope that crazy isn't contagious. 
 Take this. 
 Can't you just do what someone says for once? 
 Means a lot coming from you. 
 Oh! (Laughs) 
 Oooh! 
 Prepare to have your perception altered. 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon thee. 
 Through this world, we can see. 
 Another place where we can be. 
 Take the Fire, make it burn. 
 Take the Air and make it turn. 
 Take this Water and this Earth - and to another world call us forth. 
 (Wind whistles) 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee! 
 Through this world, we can see. Another place where we can be. 
 Take the Fire, make it burn. 
 Take the Air and make it turn. 
 Take this Water and this Earth, and to another world call us forth. 
 Earth, Water, Fire, Air!... 
 Earth, Water, Fire, Air! 
 (Screams) (Screams) 
 Nobody thinks it's weird that the detective was behaving like a hobo? 
 Oh, I get it - we're in another universe. 
 Still haven't seen them. 
 Teenagers don't just disappear into a forest. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 We need your help. We need to check the hide-out. 
 Andy might be there. 
 Felix, check this out! Chicken feet! 
 I placed offering for ghost boy. Important you feed ghosts. 
 What about the school? 
 Andy might have gone back to see his girlfr... 
 Um, his special friend. 
 That uber nerd has a special friend? 
 Jake : What happens when two of the same person from different universes meet? 
 I don't know, but it can't be good. 
 What about the incredibly powerful demon who wants to restore us out of this universe? 
 The demon's taken over the whole netball team! 
 How could you tell? 
 You could tell!
