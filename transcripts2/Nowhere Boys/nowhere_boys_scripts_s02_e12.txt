 You cast a spell to get me magic and you got stuck there. 
 It would be different this time - I know how how to do it. 
 What is this place? And how do I get out of here? 
 This is your home now, Andy. 
 You swapped us! 
 Do not open your mouth. 
 Too late. 
 The lines on the talisman - they're the same pattern as the ley lines. 
 That's the school! 
 What are we looking for? 
 Another talisman. 
 Sp we could swap back to our old bodies with that thing? 
 I'm me! 
 Think we can use this to talk to Andy? 
 We might be able to bring him home... 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 12 
 Hey... This looks better on you. 
 (Laughs) You bet it does. 
 We don't have time for this. 
 Felix! 
 We need to contact Andy, right? 
 But we have the talisman, so... 
 And the ley lines magnify magical power, especially where they intersect. 
 Like at the altar in the forest. 
 Ellen : And this one. 
 So we use the altar to boost the communication spell, and find a spell that turns a window into a door. 
 That's brilliant. 
 Just have to find one first. 
 Do you know what they're saying? 
 They lost me at 'ley lines.' 
 Mm. 
 Felix...? 
 These books have more spells than I've ever seen before. 
 Felix! 
 (Cracking) 
 Ice... 
 The talisman! 
 What does that mean? 
 Nothing good. 
 Do you guys feel that? 
 It's freezing! 
 The air conditioning. 
 Magic. 
 Elemental magic. 
 Alice knows about the second talisman. 
 What's she doing? 
 Trying to stop us from reaching Andy, like she did last time. 
 Felix, do something! 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee. 
 Water, Fire, Earth and Air, aid in my quest - I call you forth. 
 Water, Fire, Earth and Air... 
 No! 
 This is not happening! 
 We can't stay here. Come on! 
 Anything? 
 Nothing. She's not there either. 
 Maybe she's gone. 
 Not without the talisman. 
 How does that thing work? 
 It needs all four of us. 
 It glows when there's a magical bad guy. 
 She's not here. Come on. 
 Can you slow Alice down, get the cops on to her? 
 Leave it with me. 
 Be careful. 
 You too. 
 (Crackling) 
 There was another intersection on the map. That's where we need to go. 
 You think there'll be another altar? 
 I hope so. 
 It's locked. 
 Freezing! 
 How could it be locked? 
 You just need to put some muscle into it. 
 How's that working out for you? 
 Felix : She's freezing us in. 
 Oh, man! 
 This way! Go, come on! 
 Frozen. 
 Nothing to it. 
 Can we use the talisman? 
 Jake, Sam! 
 Hurry! 
 Hey, come on! 
 This isn't fair! 
 That's Felix's Fire; one more. 
 Jake - Earth. 
 Who said magic spells aren't glamorous? 
 Uh, excuse me? 
 Oh. I was just, um, wanting to... 
 Put some menus in the staffroom? 
 Right... 
 Door was open, so... 
 Uh-huh. 
 I'm gonna suggest you come back on a school day. 
 Ah, yeah - sure. 
 Yeah - the exit's this way. 
 Oh! 
 Nope, nope - that way. 
 Oh. 
 Yep. 
 Felix! 
 Sam, Jake! 
 We have to get out of here, Felix! 
 I know, I know! Stand back. 
 It won't be hot. Try now. 
 What did you do? 
 I melted the ice. 
 Can you blitz this one too? 
 Don't need to. 
 Water... 
 All : Fire, Earth and Air. 
 All : Elements that we all share. 
 Let's roll. 
 Hello? 
 We need to find another tear. 
 Why? 
 To talk to my friends, so that we can find a way to get me home. 
 You don't... like it here? 
 Of course not. 
 I want some of Nai Nai's dumplings... 
 And I wanna watch science documentaries with Dad. 
 I even wanna hear Viv call me 'her annoying little brother'. 
 What's happening? 
 You did this. 
 Andy, run! 
 Why did you say I did this? 
 Just run! 
 We're not gonna make it. 
 We have to. 
 I can't! 
 You can - if you try. 
 Wait! 
 This way! 
 Sorry about this, Murphy - orders from head office. 
 What is Alice doing? Why trap us in the school? 
 If she wanted the talisman, we would have been sitting ducks. 
 She's planning something, but I've no idea what. 
 Hang on - let's check the maps again. 
 If there's an altar at every intersection... 
 Then there's a third one here. 
 But there's nothing out there except... some old warehouses. 
 It'll take forever to walk. 
 We need some wheels. 
 I can't call my brother again. 
 But I can go one better. 
 They can't do this. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I need a warrant for Alice Hartley's arrest, urgently. 
 On what grounds? 
 She's behind all this. 
 She's a witch. 
 I know she's not very pleasant, but I wouldn't go that far. 
 No, no. no. I mean, she's a real, bona fide witch. 
 Maybe that break will do you good. 
 You reported me, didn't you? 
 Why? 
 Well, you haven't exactly been acting rationally. 
 You have no idea what you've just done. 
 (Mobile rings) 
 Murphy. 
 I don't understand. I did that? How? 
 What you feel - this place feels. 
 That's not logical. Places don't have feelings. 
 This place is different. 
 I've managed to deduce that much. 
 So... 
 Figure out the rest. 
 If I'm scared... 
 Then this place is scary. 
 And if I wanna go home... 
 You're flickering. Why are you flickering? 
 You still don't understand, Andy. 
 We think we've found another altar. 
 It's miles away, and we don't have much time. 
 Alright. But you're not all going to fit in my car. 
 Seriously? It's an emergency, and you're worrying about seatbelts? 
 Yeah, seriously! I'm still an officer of the law. 
 I'll take four of you, max. 
 It's OK, you guys go ahead. Jake and I will be right. 
 'Right' how? 
 (Starts engine) 
 Sam, wait up! 
 You look real. You feel real. 
 How long have you been here? 
 Forever. 
 I can't stay here forever. 
 Andy! 
 I can learn to like it. 
 That's not enough. 
 There's a place I'm not supposed to show you yet. 
 Wow...! 
 This is amazing - windows into other universes. 
 It's endless. 
 Every possible choice, every possible decision. 
 It's beautiful. 
 She didn't think so. 
 Who? 
 Alice? 
 Still want to go home? 
 Show me more. 
 Who do you keep borrowing these bikes from? 
 (Laughs) Oh, come on, you love it! Now for a little turbo boost. 
 Please tell me that's just your wind powers! 
 What is this place? 
 It's an old wool store. 
 I wanna hold your hand. 
 When you two are done flirting...? 
 What was that? 
 I don't know. 
 This is priceless! 
 Don't. Just don't. 
 This place is the worst. Creepy makes my hungry. 
 What doesn't make you hungry? 
 Food. 
 Come on. We've got to find this altar. 
 You go inside. I'll keep an eye out for our favourite sisters. 
 I'll need to find the right spell. 
 Come on, magical altar thingummy. Where are you? 
 This place is massive. 
 Could be anywhere. 
 How about it, Oscar? Got any more magical-altar vibes? 
 I'm not getting anything. 
 You wouldn't do anything stupid, would you? 
 Based on recent experience? 
 I know how badly you want to get Andy back. 
 We all do. 
 Before... This is what I saw. 
 This is me. 
 Do you know where I am? 
 I think it's where Andy is. 
 You can't do it, Felix. 
 Do what? 
 Go in after him. 
 Even if I wanted to, I don't know how. 
 Promise me you won't do anything stupid. 
 I need to find the spell. 
 Wow. 
 Got it. 
 
 
 
 Felix! 
 Jake : Hey, Felix, Oscar! Over here! 
 Wow. 
 Ellen : That's what I said. 
 So we've got everything we need now, right? Talisman, altar. 
 Here we come, Andy, ready or not. 
 Hey! 
 (Mobile rings) 
 Hello? 
 They're here. 
 Can you stop them? 
 Ah! 
 Frozen! 
 Hello? 
 Hey! 
 OK, we have to hurry. 
 I think... maybe... 
 Whoa. Jackpot. 
 The talisman is a key. 
 Now we open the door to Andy. 
 Elements of the universe, within and without, unlock the door, turn world about. 
 Elements of the universe, within and without, unlock the door, turn world about. 
 Sam : How cool is this? 
 Andy, can you hear me? Are you there? 
 Weird - it's the same. 
 It's this place, but not. 
 But where's Andy? 
 Can you find him? 
 Andy! 
 Dude! 
 I figured it out. 
 Me too. 
 I think I did it first. 
 Really, guys? Still competitive? 
 Alice sent me here. 
 Not sent - swapped. 
 Why? 
 I think that's how it works. 
 Someone has to be there. 
 So to get you out, we have to send someone else in. 
 Like who? 
 Oscar! 
 What are you doing? 
 Can't let you, Felix. 
 Does someone want to give me a clue? 
 I have no idea. 
 Bear! What happened? 
 You want to leave me. 
 My friends! 
 I thought we were friends. 
 We are. 
 Bear! 
 Bear! 
 Bear, come back! 
 Oskie, what are you doing? 
 It's for the best, Felix. 
 Give it back, please! 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Why don't you just tell them? 
 Tell us what? 
 What's going on? 
 He's gonna swap himself for Andy. I was tryina stop him. 
 He's what? 
 It's the only way to get him out. 
 You want to go in there on purpose? 
 It'll take the heat off everyone. 
 It'll stop Andy's family from going out of their minds. 
 What about you, your family... 
 Me? 
 Look, we'll get Andy out first and we'll deal with the rest later. 
 Come on, come on! 
 (Engine stalls) 
 Come on, start! 
 Elements of the universe... 
 Within and without. 
 Unlock the door, turn world about. 
 Elements that knit and bind, hear my will, join different kinds. 
 Felix : Barrier, no bar. 
 She's here. 
 Alice! We know you're here. 
 You have to pay for what you've done. 
 Space be no hindrance, no barrier, no bar. 
 Fire, Water, Earth and Air, bound and shared together as one, access my power, limits undone. 
 This isn't how it goes! 
 Get ready. 
 How will I know? 
 Felix, what's happening? 
 Binding spell. 
 Felix...? 
 Phoebe...? 
 Keep going. 
 Guys...? 
 Fire, Water, Earth and Air, bound and shared together as one. 
 What is this? 
 Our powers... 
 Access my power, limits undone. 
 I feel incredible! 
 I told you. 
 So strong... 
 Look at this! 
 You've got plenty of time for showing off. 
 Come on. 
 It's over. 
 (Thunder) 
 Felix : Ellen? 
 Hm? 
 You OK? 
 I think so... 
 What happened? 
 She really took our powers. 
 Not even a spark. 
 The ground's not moving. 
 How could they do this? Aren't our powers part of us? 
 I've felt this before, when Alice enchanted my legs. 
 Binding spell. 
 This time, she bound our powers to Phoebe. 
 So we're all just... normal? 
 Normal... and powerless. 
 It's game over. 
 Alice has the talisman. We're finished. Go home. 
 But what about Andy? 
 Let me take Andy's place. 
 Don't be stupid. 
 I'll go willingly. 
 You can keep your powers. 
 He's going after Andy by himself. 
 Wait! You don't understand. 
 We completely understand! 
 We have to get out of here. 
 Seriously, dude, now! 
 Order must be restored. You must restore it. 
 Bear...? 
 Bear! 
 Run, go! 
 Felix : Andy... 
 Andy's the restoring demon? 
 Felix : Just like Alice was. 
 He wouldn't hurt us! 
 Maybe he doesn't have a choice.
