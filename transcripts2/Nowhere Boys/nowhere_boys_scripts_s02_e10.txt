 Andy! 
 Guys! 
 If you got yourself there, why can't you get yourself back? 
 That wasn't me. 
 Why wouldn't Alice want us to talk to Andy? 
 Because she put him there. 
 I've been researching missing persons. Jane Upton, William Quayle, Alice Hartley. 
 Whatever happened to them happened to Andy. 
 From earth you came. To earth return. 
 She was never real! 
 Here's your precious talisman! Better get Andy back with it! 
 What if you could walk again? Would you let me help you? 
 Oscar, how did you do this? 
 No! 
 I don't know what's happening! 
 Oscar! 
 Stop this, Alice! 
 Not until I get the talisman. 
 Bring him down. 
 You can't do this! 
 No! 
 Halt. 
 (Boom!) 
 What have you done?! 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 10 
Original air date: Sunday 18th January, 2015 
 (Gasps and grunts) 
 Careful. 
 Yep... there. 
 Felix, what were you thinking? 
 I had to make a choice. 
 It wasn't yours to make. It affects all of us! 
 Especially Andy. 
 What would you have done, Jake? 
 Guys, Alice and Phoebe - they're gone. 
 After what you've done, you just walk away? 
 It's not what you think. 
 What am I supposed to think? You had that poor kid up a tree! 
 I was never gonna hurt him. I just needed leverage. 
 Leverage? You can't be serious! 
 (Sighs) I had to make sure they couldn't use the talisman. 
 Why? What is going on, Alice? What's this really about? 
 You won't believe it, Phoebes. 
 Tell me. 
 I'll show you. 
 I just don't get it. Why would Alice destroy the talisman? 
 Something that powerful... it doesn't make sense. 
 Why does Alice even care about Andy? 
 Well she put Andy there, and now she's trying to stop us bringing him home. 
 Isn't Alice lucky she's got you on her side? 
 Jake, stop it! 
 That's not fair! 
 You helped her out. 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 Not give away our only chance of getting Andy back. 
 My brothers are losers, but if something bad ever happened to them... 
 Someone had to do something. 
 Seriously? You think Felix did the right thing? 
 So you'd have let him fall? 
 (Leaves crack underfoot) 
 You hear that? 
 What was that? 
 Alice and Phoebe...? 
 I vote not sticking around to find out. 
 Guys... guys, I need some help! 
 OK, Oskie. Up... 
 I can't... 
 I'm sorry, Felix. 
 Hello, boys. 
 Hey guys, wait up! Where's Felix and Oscar? 
 Oscar! 
 (Groans) 
 We just ran off and left him! Who does that? 
 Oops...? 
 Come on, then. 
 That was quite an explosion. 
 How about you explain what that was? 
 Fireworks. 
 Fireworks... hmm. 
 That huge explosion was fireworks? 
 Uh... a sky rocket. 
 We know we shouldn't, but... 
 I know, I know. 
 But do you come out here and let off illegal pyrotechnics often? 
 (Laughs nervously) 
 Roland. 
 Oh, man... sprung again. 
 He's fully questioning them! What do we do? 
 Get them out of there? 
 Yeah, but how? 
 Were you playing with fireworks the day that Andy Lau went missing? 
 No. 
 What about the Hartley sisters? 
 How are they involved? 
 Who? 
 Ah... 
 We're gonna play this game, are we? 
 Something's gotten terribly out of hand, Felix. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Tell me what's going on out here, Felix. 
 What? We've told you everything we know about Andy. 
 Where's your wheelchair? 
 Not here. 
 Oh? 
 How did he get out here, then? 
 Answer my question. 
 Felix gave me a piggyback. 
 Really? 
 What, all the way from town? 
 Because I saw him running. So how do you explain that? 
 Must have been someone else. 
 Yeah. 
 Why don't you show us, Oscar? Show us your running. 
 Come on, think! 
 We need a distraction. 
 Like what? 
 ...And I don't know why Felix is determined to lie to me. 
 (Wind whistles and buffets) 
 You lie about fireworks, you lie about your brother walking... 
 You don't understand. 
 What else are you lying about, Felix? 
 What has this got to do with Andy Lau? 
 Felix...? Felix, I know... 
 One way or another, Felix! (Groans) 
 One way or another... I will... 
 Thanks! 
 Thank Sam. We need to get out of here. 
 I will prove that you're involved! 
 Not just a pretty face after all! 
 Is it the style or the smile? 
 (Laughs) 
 Whose power's the best now? 
 It was you, Felix! I know it was you! 
 You're doing that? 
 It's an elemental thing. 
 You don't need a spell? 
 I came home with it when I crossed universes. 
 Oh, with a random supernatural power? (Laughs) You didn't think to tell me? 
 Well, you and magic haven't exactly been friends. 
 This is where Felix's fireball came from, and the teens... 
 ...All have some kind of elemental power. 
 (Laughs incredulously) 
 What if you could, too? 
 No, we're not going there again. 
 It wouldn't be so dangerous this time. 
 Ten years ago you cast a spell to get me magic and you got stuck there... nowhere! 
 It would be different this time. I know how to do it. 
 Can't we just have a normal, boring life? 
 No magic, no sudden disappearances? 
 Tacos and Mexican soda... Is that what you want? 
 If I had to choose. 
 After all these years trying, you'd say no? 
 I'm surprised. 
 I never should have believed Alice. 
 It's not your fault. How could you have known? 
 Not to trust Alice? Pretty sure most of us could have figured that one out. 
 I had to make a call. 
 Every time you make a call, it's a disaster! 
 Like you're such a team player, leaving Oskie and me behind back there! 
 Hey! Enough arguing! 
 We need to figure out what we're gonna do. 
 About Alice? 
 About Roland. He saw Oscar running. 
 He's not gonna stop trying to prove we're responsible. 
 If only we could rewind. 
 Yeah, erase his hard drive. 
 Actually... that might work. 
 If I combine a couple of spells... 
 We could wipe Roland's memory? 
 With what? We've got no talisman, remember? 
 Alice's magic tablet! She used it on me. 
 Yeah, like she's just gonna hand it over. 
 Maybe not voluntarily. 
 Jake, where are you going? 
 Should we follow him? What if he takes on Alice alone? 
 No, we need to get Oscar home. 
 What was it like where you were? 
 It was lonely. Nothing there made sense. 
 But the magic was strong, so it made me strong. 
 But you were so weak when you got back. 
 It didn't want to let me go. 
 "It"...? 
 It uses people. 
 If I said yes... 
 About the elemental power... 
 How would it work? 
 (Pounds against window) 
 Alice! 
 Ellen : Jake's not answering his phone. I'm worried. 
 Oscar : It's OK. Just drop me off, then you guys go to Phoebe's. 
 What? 
 What do you know about twisters? 
 Uh... visible funnels of rotating air? 
 No, in Bremin. 
 How common are they? 
 Uh... not very, not that I'm aware of. 
 I want you to pull everything you can up on Alice Hartley. 
 Really? Why? 
 I wanna know how she's connected to Andy Lau. 
 Andy Lau? 
 Can you just do it? 
 And I'll read it when I get back. 
 From where? 
 I know what you did! 
 (Low rumbling) 
 What is happening? 
 Jake, you have to stop this! 
 Bring him home. 
 Before someone gets hurt! 
 What you did to Andy and Oscar and Saskia... you're evil! 
 She was a golem. She had a job to do! 
 (Loud crack) 
 Jake, please! 
 You destroyed her. 
 You made Saskia feel things. That's what destroyed her. 
 No, that's not true, it's not! 
 You did it because she stopped obeying you - it wasn't me. It was you! 
 (Earth crumbling) 
 
 
 
 Jake! 
 He's here! 
 Jake, Jake! We need their help! 
 I can't stop! 
 You know how. Control the power... 
 For Andy's sake. 
 (Crumbling settles) 
 Get him out of here! 
 Roland saw the talisman explode. 
 Now! 
 He's been to the hide. He knows about magic. 
 Magic...? 
 He can't prove anything. 
 That's what I said. 
 Phoebe : What do you need? 
 We need help with a memory-wiping spell. 
 Alice : No, Phoebe! 
 Ellen : Guys... 
 Who, uh... wants to explain this? 
 Fracking. 
 A hydraulic means of extracting shale gas. 
 Felix : Yeah, that's right. 
 (Tiny stones tumble) 
 (Sniffs) 
 Fracking. 
 Yes, yes. 
 Yep. Fracking. 
 That's right - fracking. 
 (Sighs) 
 I know you're all part of this. 
 And... what exactly is 'this'? 
 You tell me. 
 You. You disappear - and just as suddenly, you reappear. 
 My sister's been away backpacking. 
 Backpacking. 
 For ten years? 
 With no record in the database of ever exiting or re-entering the country? 
 Must be a computer glitch. 
 What I wanna know is your connection to the disappearance of Andy Lau. 
 We don't know anything about him. 
 Long story short, I think you do. 
 Alice : We've never even met the kid. 
 How about we go down to the station and we put that on record? 
 I think it's time that we made this official. 
 Detective, we would be more than happy to come down to the station - as soon as we've spoken to our lawyer. 
 We'll need a lawyer too, and an adult advocate. 
 For each of us. 
 Oscar : So the magic tablet is like the talisman? 
 Wow. 
 I know... freaky. 
 Felix... I am so sorry. I was an idiot to trust Alice. 
 No, no, I get it. You wanted to walk again. 
 Who wouldn't? 
 It's not that. It wasn't about walking. 
 We've both used magic to try and change this, but I just wanted things between us to be the way they were before. 
 Like that? 
 Yeah, pretty much. 
 (Both laugh and grunt) 
 So, let me get this straight. 
 Ley lines are invisible lines around the world... 
 That connect places... 
 Of mystical significance, exactly. 
 What's this got to do with Bremin? 
 You've marked where the boys disappeared, where Andy disappeared, and where these other disappearances happened. 
 They all disappeared along this ley line. 
 Like the pyramids, or Stonehenge? 
 "Pyramids,  Stone Hedge , Bremin". I can see that on a T-shirt. 
 And if the energy of the ley line is harnessed, then the psychical magical happenings are magnified. 
 You think your brother disappeared magically? 
 All the evidence points to that, yes. 
 Thank you, Vivian. Do you mind if I hold onto this? 
 Detective, I don't mean to be disrespectful... 
 Then don't be. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 We have to find him, detective. 
 I always do. 
 You're not seriously considering this, are you? 
 Always good to look at every angle. 
 (Owl hoots) 
 You gave them my tablet. 
 We can't risk Roland asking more questions. 
 And what if the kids do more than wipe his memory? 
 You think they can get Andy out? 
 (Sighs) 
 I'm not sure. 
 The tablet's not as powerful as that talisman. 
 If Felix's spell works, then we are off the hook. 
 And if it doesn't, then he's the one Roland sees trying magic. 
 So where are  we  now? 
 Where we always have been. 
 (Ellen clears throat) 
 Oh... 
 Ellen. Hey. 
 Was I drooling? I was, wasn't I? 
 Afraid so. 
 You're not supposed to see that. 
 You were up all night? 
 Yeah. 
 Turns out this memory-wiping thing is more complicated than I thought. 
 Jake's right, you know - you don't always have to do this alone. 
 I made the mess. 
 I need to fix this. 
 Maybe you could reinvent the wheel while you're at it, caveman? 
 Sam and Jake are meeting us there, so... 
 Yeah, we'd better go. 
 Uh-huh. 
 (Sprays deodorant) 
 We need to get Roland alone, OK? 
 So you two lead him to the bush. Jake and I will go and prepare the spell. 
 What do you need me for? 
 You're gonna do the spell. 
 Since when? 
 If you don't feel up to it... 
 You're on. 
 We have to move fast. 
 OK, by 'lead him' Felix means...? 
 Leave it to me. 
 I've got this. 
 I don't see how we'll get Roland's attention from here. 
 He's not even gonna see us; you're not the only one that can do distractions. 
 Sure you don't need to take a break? 
 When I'm this close to proving what really happened to Andy Lau...? 
 No. 
 Can we hurry this up? 
 I'm still getting the hang of this, OK? 
 Oh, grumpy. 
 (Distant whistling) 
 (Whistling deepens) 
 Are you getting this? 
 Getting what? 
 Detective...? 
 When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. 
 Where are you going? 
 To get the truth. 
 Do you think it worked? 
 Here he comes. 
 Hey! 
 Oi! 
 Felix, about yesterday... 
 Me being such a... 
 Loser? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I just really want Andy back. 
 It's OK. 
 I mean, if it was me... 
 If I had a brother, I'd do the same thing. 
 Thanks, mate. 
 We're on our way! 
 Yep, OK. 
 They're coming. 
 You got the spell? 
 I'm ready if you're ready. 
 No, Felix, it's cool. This is your thing. 
 Do it. 
 Get ready! 
 You're sure? 
 What are you doing? 
 Go, Jake. 
 Sam, the circle. 
 Oh! 
 Roland, over here... 
 Through time and space, altogether, erase and quell forever. 
 What on earth is this? 
 Through time and space, altogether, erase and quell forever. 
 Sam, seal the circle! 
 Oh! 
 Ellen : Not from the inside, doofus! 
 Take all thought, transform, renew! 
 Through time and space altogether, erase and quell forever. 
 Sam, get out of the circle! 
 Huh? 
 Did it work? 
 (Groans) 
 Only one way to find out. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What happened? 
 Who's that? 
 Yep, it worked. 
 His phone. 
 "Ley lines"...? 
 Come on, let's get out of here before he starts asking questions. 
 Deleted. 
 Are you OK? 
 Why didn't you get out of the circle, mate? 
 What? 
 Dudes... 
 Hey, dudes! 
 (Shrieks) 
 You are so old. 
 Roberts. 
 Roberts, you have to help me. 
 Who is this? 
 It's me. 
 Prank-calling the police station might not be the smartest thing to do, young man. 
 There were two necklaces. 
 Two versions of you... 
 And two Garys. 
 But Alice doesn't have a talisman here... 
 Which means for some reason she never had it here. 
 We can still find it! 
 So according to this, it's all to do with the ley lines. 
 The disappearances, the strange events, the magic... 
 What does that mean? 
 The lines on the talisman! 
 They're the same pattern as the ley line. 
 Felix! 
 Can I ask what you're doing? 
 Oh, Mrs Ferne... 
 Haven't you harass my son enough? 
 No. 
 Do not open your mouth. 
 Whatever. Just tell Felix he needs to change us back right now. 
 You coming?
