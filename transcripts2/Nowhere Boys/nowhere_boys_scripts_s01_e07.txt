 Of course I remember the carving. 
 Sam : I knew it! 
 I didn't do that with you. I was with my boyfriend, Sammy. 
 Andy :  You were never born. 
 Your parents had another son, and the two of you are so alike! 
 Hey, I'm nothing like that twisted gimp! 
 You just saved my life! 
 My mission was to deliver this! 
 I've never been admired before. 
 I'm Ellen. 
 Sarah, everything OK? 
 Boy : My mum's got a whole new life, and she's married to Bates! 
 Mr. Bates? What!? 
 Whoa! 
 Phoebe :  Behold - the elemental talisman. 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee. 
 My dog WikiLeaks is missing. 
 Zeus. 
 Zeus! Come on, boy! 
 (Dog snarls)

 Season 1, Episode 7 
 Poser! 
 Girl : Oh, my God! He's so cute! (Girls chatter) 
 Hey, Sam, my sister showed me your YouTube video last night. 
 It was so cool! Wish I could skate like... 
 Yeah, man, sick moves. 
 1,200 views in one week. You should go pro. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Maybe. 
 Dude, she's the hottest girl in Bremin. 
 Yeah, not quite the way I imagined rocking back up to Bremin High. 
 I still don't get why we have to go to school. 
 You want the police off your backs, you go to school. 
 Gary was on my case AGAIN this morning, so try not to do anything suspicious. 
 Bit late for that. 
 You didn't have to bring us here. 
 Well, you can't just turn up to school without your Aunty Phoebe. 
 (Whispers) She creeps me out. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, at least this place hasn't changed. 
 Famous last words. 
 Now, this is where the magic happens. 
 Felix, can you help me out at the shop after school? 
 OK. 
 Excellent. 
 OK, let's do this! 
 Dude, are you actually excited? 
 This is way better than hanging out in that lame shed. 
 There's a canteen, showers, hot girls. 
 And a library! I can study wormholes. 
 It's like he was born without an 'off' switch. 
 (Creepy sound, dog growls) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Ah, that's right, Bremin High, I am back! 
 It's that guy from the bus. Oh, he's so cute! 
 Different universe, same Sam. 
 They're not looking at you, man. 
 What do you mean? 
 You saved the girl from the bus! You're an inspiration. 
 Girl : Apparently the bus had lost control. He's SUCH a hero. 
 This is awkward. 
 Just go with it, man. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 (Music stops abruptly) 
 Well, this sucks. 
 Hi again. 
 Hi. 
 Do you wanna sit with us at lunch? 
 We have pretty much the best spot on the oval. 
 Sure, as long as it's not too close to the big oak tree. 
 The pollen sets off my allergies. 
 Rightio, class, these boys are new to the area. 
 This is their first day at Bremin High. 
 I trust you'll all make them feel very welcome. 
 Perfect. Uhm... 
 Perhaps you'd like to introduce yourselves to the class, boys. 
 My name is Felix, and these are my cousins Jake, Andy, and Sam, and we're here for an exchange while our parents are away for work, and we're staying with our Aunt Phoebe. 
 The Witch Lady? Ooh, I'm gonna turn you into toads! 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, that's enough! Let's get started. Boys, you can take a seat. 
 Andy, over here! 
 So, today we will be experimenting further with methods for extracting chemical compounds from plants. 
 Last week, we discovered that chemiluminescence levels can be altered in the presence of an oxidising agent, if you recall. Hi. I'm Mike. And this week, using an evaporation method... I don't get what Mia sees in that jerk! Um, you? What? You and Sammy, you're sort of similar, except he's better-looking. Come on, I'm nothing like that doofus! Boy :  Go Sammy! Oh, that was pretty cool. Look at that! Nice one, man. (Boys whoop and cheer) Jake : Pretty twisted, huh? Sam : Yeah. He skates just like you, too. Oh, come on! I'm heaps better than him. I'm just saying. You know that used to be us? Except we were never such lame attention seekers. (Laughs) You sure? Yeah. Come on, let's  try . Try what? To fit in. What for? Because we may be here for a while! Man, don't say things like that. So, I'll take you to my favourite spot... Ellen! Yes...? Did you find your dog, WikiLeaks? No. If you want, we could put up fliers after school, around the shops. That's a really good idea. Cool, well... Hey, Andy, do you wanna help after school, putting up fliers? Andy : Then the bus swerved past, missing us by mere millimetres. I could feel the heat of the engine roaring past me. It was like the whole world was in slow motion. Did you realise how dangerous it was? I just kept thinking Bear Grylls has done scarier things than this. (Laughter) I am putting all this on my blog. It's called  Interview with a Hero . How come you haven't RSVPed to my party yet? I only got the message, like, 30 seconds ago. You should come. It's in a week. We could go together, if you want to. Um... But if you've already got plans and stuff, that's totally cool. No, sure. Sounds fun. Ellen : Cool. Nice shot, mate! Join in. Trent :  This guy's a natural. Hey! Hey! Show and tell! Jerks! Hear ye, I call upon the dragon Tolreth to help save this kingdom forsaken by darkness. What are you doing here? Even aliens have to go to school. So, what are you up to? Just plotting the destruction of the universe. Cool. Wanna help? Yeah. Mia, wait up, wait up! The other day was just my lame attempt at trying to impress you. Yeah, that makes sense, because being lame is always impressive. You're right, you're right, it was stupid, it was stupid. Hey, I heard you're a great web designer. Maybe you could help me make my own skating website. Look, Mia, please, I just want to talk to you! Look, I really don't know that much about you, OK? And I have a boyfriend who, when I last checked, wanted you dead. I made this for you. Is that me? Mia : It's good. Just back off! Give it back to her. Fighting again, are you serious? You're as bad as each other! Mia, wait! Kids :  Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Aren't you going to help? Mia! What is going on here?! Nothing. That kid's a thief! Right, principal's office, both of you! He broke into my house! He's a maniac! Now! I didn't do anything! My blog is gonna be so action-packed! In the grounds of school, we do not condone fighting, Jacob. I don't know what Mum sees in you. I beg your pardon? Mia, wait! Mia, I'm sorry. You and Sammy are the same - completely selfish. Hey, I'm nothing like Sammy. Really? So, coming up to me all the time, even when I ask you not to, that's not selfish? Fighting with my boyfriend, embarrassing me in front of all my friends, that's for my sake, is it? You're right. Maybe we are the same. I'm sorry. I won't bother you anymore. This really is for you, and you should learn how to skate, I know you want to. Mia! Mia! I need your advice! 
 
 Hi. It's urgent. I need your full attention. OK, you've got it. How can you tell if a boy likes you? I guess they pay attention to you. He's done most of the talking so far. Any other signs? They care about what you want. Like, if you wanted to learn to skate, they'd encourage you. That hasn't come up. That is gorgeous! Did Sammy do that? Um... Are you talking about that boy from the bus? Oh, he's so cute! You go, girl! You should get that framed. (Barking) Was that a dog? (Barking and snarling) Oscar : It's your turn. OK, this time let's be brothers, torn apart by a savage war. Started by an outcast alien life force. We've just been reunited in a galactic battle and have to save our father. Penethor, is that you? Come, there is much fortune to be had in Theden, but first we must stand united! But, Penethor, it is I, Morden. Brother? Yes, it's me... Your brother. Hey, brainy dude. I never realised being popular was so stressful! Why's that? Being noticed all the time, girls hanging off my every word... I can feel my anxiety levels creeping up on me with every compliment. If it's any consolation, being unpopular sucks too. Uh-oh. That's him! Hey! Are you the kid that fought my brother? Yeah, that's me. Should I go find a teacher? Look, guys, we don't have to fight. Maybe you should have thought of that  before  you got Sammy in trouble. You know what, let's make this fair. Just you and me. Time to use my secret powers. Look, Vince, I'm not afraid of you. You still wet the bed. (Laughs) What's he on about? Sammy told me about your little accidents. About how you have bad dreams. Why would Sammy say that? Oh, and Sammy also told me about how he found you in your mum's bikini. Ooh, a swimwear model! Sammy...! Hey, Vince? What? Still single? Shut up! Impressive. I think I just got Sammy in trouble. Should I feel bad? You found a nonviolent solution to a violent situation. Speaking of solutions, I've let my popularity get in the way of my true mission. Which is...? Wormholes! I'll see you back in class! Once a nerd, always a nerd. (Growling) I knew it! I thought I was giving you the tour. Looks like you know this place better than I do. Yes, well, I have an affinity for libraries. So, have you had any interesting correspondence lately? That would presuppose a letterbox, so, no. Are you sure? Actually, I did get a hand-delivered note the other day. It was very peculiar. Really? Why? The message was kind of cryptic. It said... 'Me into you'... No. 'U + M...' To the power of E equals... That was from you? I wanted to thank you for saving me, but I couldn't find you on Facebook. Thanks. I don't normally like popular, heroic types, but you're different. Maybe because I'm not really either of those things. It's just a strange alignment of circumstan... See what I mean? Who even says that? So cute! Woman  (on tannoy):  Attention, all teachers. There'll be a meeting in the staffroom... Oh. Excuse me, have you seen Mr. Bates? Yeah, he should be back in a minute. Hey, how are you? Oh, hi! Did you and your... dad find a house? Oh! Um, not yet. Sorry about the other day, rushing off like that. If you want some help, let me know, because we've just listed a couple of fantastic properties. (Coughs) I will! Thanks. Oh! Oh, I've just got to catch my breath. (Sarah gasps) So, who's looking after your kids today? Oh, Mr Bates and I don't have any kids. Oh... I'm... I didn't mean to... Is it hot in here, or... I guess. Oh, excuse me, I've got to... gotta go home. (Footsteps scuff) Mia : You're good, you know. My mum's an artist. Or... was. I mean, is! She's not dead, or anything. She's just not here. Sorry for before. It's OK. You don't have to apologise every time you get angry. Sometimes you should just let yourself be angry. How come you know so much about me? Where I come from, I used to date a girl who was just like you, except now I'm only just figuring out that I should have treated her the way she deserved. Well, at least you've learned something. Like, she wanted to know how to skate, except I never taught her, and I told her it was because I didn't want her to fall, but you wanna know the real reason? You were worried she'd be better than you? No way! The real reason is because I liked it when she was watching me. You know, I liked the feeling of her watching me being good at something. Pretty selfish, huh? But kind of sweet. (Growls) Oh, my God! Don't make any sudden movements. (Barking and snarling) That was odd. Spooky... And romantic. What should we do? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. (Growling) Oh, my God, it's WikiLeaks! Stay back! Whatever you do, don't look him in the eye. Bear Grylls once did that to a rhino. You just scared away my dog who's been missing for a week! WikiLeaks, wait! Ellen, don't! (Snaps fingers) I'm over here! What are you doing? Getting help! Run! (Screaming and barking) Girl : Run! Man : Get out! Run! (Screaming) Get out of here! (Barking and growling) What's going on? Is this like the bees? I think so. So, what should we do? I need to find the others. Can I help? Come on! (Screaming and growling) (Screaming and barking) I'm out of here. We've gotta find the others. Let's go. I lost Ellen! We have to find her! There's no time! Have you seen Sam and Jacob? No! Ellen! (Growling) Are you guys OK? Come on, we've got to get out of here! Come on! It's no use. It's locked! Never mind! Watch this. Come on...! It worked before! Quick, do something! Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee... What is he doing? I have no idea. Air, Fire, Water, and Earth, aid at my quest, I call Ye forth. (Friendly bark) Amazeballs! You have to teach me how to do that! Felix, what just happened? Yeah, man, that was nuts! Hey, what is that? Uh, Phoebe gave it to me. Phoebe? (Bell rings)
