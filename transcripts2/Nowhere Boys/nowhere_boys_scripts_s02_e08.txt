 Andy brought it all the way home from the other universe. 
 He's really into Ellen, isn't he? 
 No need to rub it in. 
 You could've told me I was a semi-pro netballer with a crush on Andy. 
 We all know why. He likes you himself. 
 I'm still right here. 
 Anyone else see that weird place? 
 What place? 
 I think something handmade's supposed to bring good energy. 
 A lot of effort for good luck. 
 I just want everything to go well. 
 Mia, Ellen, meet Saskia, Bremin High's newest student. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Jake's friend. 
 Too much Earth. 
 You're an Earth Element. 
 And you and Andy are both Water Elements. 
 So? 
 It could mean we could use that connection to communicate with Andy. 
 Like a multi-dimensional video call. 
 Guys, look. 
 Andy... 
 Andy! 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 8 
 Jake : Andy! 
 He was just here. 
 No. No, not here. Somewhere else. 
 Jake! Sam! I'm here! 
 Ellen : It's like a window. 
 Or a tear; a tear between worlds. 
 Felix! 
 What happened? 
 Looked like a place I saw between the universes. 
 You fell and hit your head. 
 Want me to take you home? 
 No, no. 
 Thanks, mate. I'm fine. 
 Somehow that spell might let us see Andy. 
 Why can't you see me? 
 Where's the talisman? 
 Don't you have it? 
 No; I made the spell, and there was Andy... 
 Has anyone seen Saskia? 
 Andy : Look, I'm here! 
 I'm here! Hey! I'm here! 
 Guys! Come back! 
 We've got to find the talisman. 
 It's gone. 
 We've looked everywhere. 
 Sam : It's not here either. 
 What about Saskia? 
 She must have taken the talisman. 
 Why would she do that? 
 Maybe she picked it up by accident. 
 Call her. See where she is. 
 She doesn't have a phone. 
 Seriously? Dude... 
 If a girl doesn't give you her number, it's not because she doesn't have a phone. 
 OK, so we go to her house. 
 Um... 
 What? 
 I don't know where she lives. 
 (Sighs) Typical boy. Did you even ask her a single question about herself? 
 If we don't get the talisman back, we've got no hope of reaching Andy. 
 Echo : Ellen... 
 Chill. Maybe she just went to get a taco - I would! 
 OK, you two try there. We'll try the shops. 
 We'll meet back behind the taco van. 
 Let's do it. 
 Ellen? 
 Ellen, can you see me? 
 Felix : Ellen! 
 Coming! 
 Wait! I'm here! 
 Wherever that is. 
 You really think Saskia took the talisman? 
 They're both missing. 
 But why? Isn't Alice the one that wants it? 
 So it's either a coincidence or... 
 You think they're working together? 
 No way. 
 I can't think of another explanation. 
 Jake really likes her. 
 Got bigger things to deal with than liking girls right now. 
 Right. Of course. 
 I mean... 
 No, I get it. You're right. 
 We've got to find her. 
 (Groans) 
 Saskia didn't take the talisman. 
 Why would she? 
 (Sighs) Jake, I think it's time I shared some of my wisdom with you. 
 Your what? 
 You will never understand girls. Not ever. 
 And you're saying you do? 
 No, that's the point. 
 I don't even try, I just let them be unknowable. 
 Thanks, Sam. That's very helpful. 
 I know. 
 You know, I AM feeling a bit peckish. 
 Yeah, me too, you should grab me some nachos. 
 Woman : Here you are. 
 Sam : Hey, uh, one nachos. Por favor. 
 You're safe. 
 Of course. 
 Everyone's looking for you. 
 Really? Why? 
 Felix thinks you took the talisman. 
 Why would I do that? 
 I told him it was crazy. 
 You defended me? 
 Yeah, of course I did. 
 Thank you. 
 I knew you wouldn't do it. 
 Sam : Jake! 
 Just wait here? Please? 
 Hey, d'you find her? 
 Yeah. 
 Did you find her? 
 Yes. 
 And? 
 She doesn't have your talisman. 
 Did she say that? 
 She didn't have to. 
 Did you ask her? 
 Look, she doesn't have it, OK? 
 Where is she? 
 You can't just gang up on her! 
 Come on, let's hope it turns up at school. 
 (Thinks) If they can't find the talisman, you're gonna need a Plan B. 
 There has to be a way out of here. 
 This place obviously doesn't conform to normal scientific principles. 
 But it must have its own internal logic. 
 And I need to find a way to understand that logic. Otherwise, I'm gonna be stuck here forever. (Grunts) Hello? Who's there? Jake : Hey, man, have you seen Saskia? No, mate, sorry. Hey, do you know where Saskia is? Yeah, it's similar to the existing system but there are a few changes. Hi, sorry I'm late... (Teachers' conversation continues indistinctly) Welcome to Bremin High School Jake? Ordinarily, this would mean instant detention. I was just... Saskia's not feeling too well and... I was gonna take her homework over, but I don't know where she lives. If you're keen on a girl, Jake, there ARE better ways. Besides, her mum called this morning; Saskia has withdrawn from the school. What? Why? Look, I know things have been difficult these last few weeks, and... Things are changing at home. If you wanna talk... Uh, Viv... We've spoken about this, you can't just walk into admin and start sticking things. I need a permission slip to hang this up? Actually, yes, you do but I'm happy to let it go this time. How are things going... Sam. I've got it. We're gonna need transport. Couldn't have found some bigger bikes? It suits you. Come on, don't take your girlfriend problems out on me. Saskia wouldn't just leave without saying goodbye. Unless something was really wrong. You think we should tell Felix about this? Not yet. Hey! Who are you? Are you like me? Are you lost here? (Voice echoes) Hey! Wait! Come back! I just wanna talk to you! This isn't funny! I can't find Sam and Jake. And Saskia's not at school. What's that? The 'other you' made it for Andy. 'You plus me equals love'? (Laughs) The other me is sick-making. Yeah, that's what I thought. Do you think... Do you think that because other me was all netball and girly, that... That's in me too somewhere? Do you want it to be? I'd rather stick pins in my eyes. But she did look happy. You could always join the netball team. (Both laugh) Maybe I'll wait until they change the netball uniform to all black. With mandatory lip rings. (Laughs) What are you gonna do with it? I think it might help us reach Andy when we get the talisman back. What are you doing with that? (Chuckle) Why did you do that? I was trying to get home. This is your home now, Andy. Don't you know that? Jake : 5 Browning Lane. Sam : I think she's here. Jake : Only one way to find out. (Knocking) What are you boys doing here? Jake : What are YOU doing here? I came home for my break. Nothing like melted cheese on toast. You got something to tell me about Andy Lau? Um... No, sorry. Wrong house. It's not like we knew it was gonna be Robert's house. Doesn't matter now. All we know is Alice wanted the talisman and Saskia stole it for her. OK; what we really know is that you lost it, and now you're blaming Saskia. She could be in real trouble. Or maybe she just changed schools. Can't you find her? I can try. But I need something of hers. And we don't know where she lives, so it's back to square one. There are other possibilities. Like what? Maybe she's from another universe. Like you were. You needed the talisman to get home, right? That'd explain why she didn't have a phone. And why she lied about where she lived - we had to do that too. Most importantly, it explains why she liked you. Maybe she came from a universe with no boys in it. An all-girl universe. Cool. Yeah, but we'd know all of this if you'd actually asked her about the talisman last night. Actually, I do have something of hers. What's that? The dust she left. What dust? She touched my sleeve. It's like we almost turned into clay, remember? Saskia is an Earth Element. This is part of her, it has to be connected somehow. It's worth a try. I'll give it a go. It's not clear. I don't think this can be right. It's the altar. In the forest. If she is from another universe, she could be using the altar to go home. We have to get there before she does anything. How? We don't have Phoebe to drive us in this universe. We don't need Phoebe anymore. My brother owes me. Nice work, Oscar. Sorry, gotta go. How did you know my name? 
 
 What is this place? Quiet. How do I get out of here? Shh. Why? Who's gonna hear us? (Rumbling) What's happening? It's a game. Have fun. Yeah, right! That way. How? How do you think? I've no idea. Think. We need a parachute or a bridge or... Hurry! I don't know what you want me to do! It's up to you. Look! You did it! Quick - won't last forever. ♫ Put your hands up, everybody know that... ♪ Wasn't being lost out there once already enough for you nut jobs? You don't tell Mum and I won't tell her about you flunking the first semester. You've got an hour, then I'm out of here. Come on, Pete. I need more time than that. I gotta fall off a cliff before I even get there. What cliff? Nobody said anything about a cliff. OK, what's it gonna take? Wash my footy gear for a month. No way! I'll wash your car. Footy gear. Car. Footy gear. OK, OK, fine. Let's move! ♪ RAP MUSIC ♪ Here we go! (All scream) (Squeals) I keep saying I hate nature. No-one ever listens. We have to keep moving. Come on. Think you can keep up? Watch me. Andy : How is that possible? A physical manifestation of my mental image! What is this place? Doesn't have a name. Who are you? I don't have a name either. Everyone has a name. Never needed one. How about I call you Bear? "Bear"...? Like "Bear Grylls". "Bear". What was that? Ellen : What is she doing? She's got the talisman. Alice... Elements in flux, Elements unite... You were right. Doesn't matter now. Looks like she's going to the dark side. Alice : Elements in flux... It's a spell... Elements unite. Never heard it before. We have to stop her. Elements in flux... (Rumbling) Elements in flux... Elements in... Take it. Run! Saskia, don't! Make Saskia bring the talisman back! Dude? What is going on? What is she doing? Making some kind of fog. Saskia has a job to do. What's happening? Fog - she's a Water Element. Which way do we go? Who knows? I can't see anything. We have to find Alice. We'd better stick together. Saskia! Please don't follow me. Why are you doing this? I have to. If Alice is forcing you, I can help. I can't. She needs it. She's not safe as long as you have it. What? Why? I never meant to hurt you. Just tell me the truth. I came to Bremin to get the talisman. Look, I wasn't supposed to like you. It wasn't meant to be possible. OK, don't worry, the same thing happened to me, OK? We need Felix. (Rustling) Give it to me. Now! Don't do it. Saskia, your time's up. From earth you came, to earth return. I'm sorry. This is what I really am. What are you doing? Stop! What once I made, I now shall spurn. Saskia... From earth you came, to earth return. Find Andy. You gotta hand it to her. Alice has some awesome delaying tactics. Shh! Can you hear anything? Which way did they go? Jake and Saskia have to be out there somewhere. Jake : NO! Help! And Alice has a big headstart on us. Change her back! Give me the talisman! This is what she always was. Give me that! Let me go! Run! You'll pay for this! Whoa! You're too late! Dude! Run! From earth you came... We have to go! We have to go! Come on! Seriously, Jake! Saskia! Let's go! ...This earthen vessel back to clay... ...Take it back, take it away. We have to go back. We can't. Did you see the look in Alice's eyes? She's dangerous. You cured me when I was turning to clay. This is different. How? She's a golem. A what? A golem. Alice made her. Stop talking. I've heard about magic this powerful but I've never seen it. Shut up! Jake! She was never real! I said shut up! What are you doing? Jake! Stop! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Ah! Stop this! This is not his fault! Here! Here's your precious talisman! You better get Andy back with it! Let's go get Andy. Andy! Guys! If you got yourself there, why can't you get yourself back? That wasn't me, that was... tickles... Something's blocking me. Not something, someone. Why would Alice not want us to talk to Andy? Because she put him there. Can you help us? Felix... She's out of control. A witch is nothing without her Book of Shadows. If we destroy it... I'm in. You should talk to him about Saskia. That's what he's really cut up about. Me and Jake talk about feelings? You wanna do this now?! You get another swing at me like you did in the forest? How about we dial down the man angst? You put this picture in my head? But what if you could walk again? That's impossible. What if I had a spell? Would you let me help you?
