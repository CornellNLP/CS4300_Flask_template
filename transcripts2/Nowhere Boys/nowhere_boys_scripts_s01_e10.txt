 Phoebe : This is my sister, Alice. 
 I need you to find the spell that Alice cast and reverse it. 
 It's an excursion to the Bremin Ranges. Maybe we can find our own way home. 
 Maybe it has something to do with Phoebe's sister. 
 Hey, guys? 
 You boys have a demon after you. 
 Created to restore the natural order after a magical disturbance. 
 You do that again, and I'll bounce that thing off your head. 
 Police, open up! Boys! 
 Whispering Voice :  Sam... Let me help you... 
 ♪ (Theme music) 
 Season 1, Episode 10 
 (Scream on TV) 
 So unrealistic. There's no way you'd ever go into that room. 
 You leave and I'll  kill  you. 
 I'm just gonna go grab  a drink . 
 Agh, Mia! 
 Mia...? 
 Mia!? 
 (Laughs) 
 You should have seen your face. 
 I knew it all along, OK? 
 I just tripped. 
 You were freaking out. 
 No. I'm not afraid of anything. 
 Oh, come on, Sam. 
 What are you afraid of? Tell me... 
 (Felix bangs on door) 
 Phoebe! 
 Phoebe! 
 Do you know what time it is? 
 We need your help. 
 You were supposed to be here before school, remember? We had a deal. 
 We went on an excursion. 
 And we got lost again. 
 And the demon possessed Roland and tried to kill us. 
 I saw magic actually happen. 
 OK, slow it down. 
 Explain yourselves. 
 You coming? 
 He was strong enough to lift me off my feet, and then throw me... 
 I defeated the demon. 
 With the magic charm. 
 And courage. 
 So instead of sticking to our deal, you went looking for your own way home. 
 Thanks. 
 We had to take the chance. 
 It was an epic fail on all fronts. 
 So now you want me to help you. 
 Yes? 
 You boys really have a nerve. 
 Told you this was pointless. 
 You're right, I can't trust you. Deal's off. 
 Come on. We're wasting our time. 
 Do you recognise this? 
 They're used for the conjurations. 
 Did it belong to Alice? 
 Where did you find that? 
 The Bremin Forest. 
 The police looked there, and so did I. 
 It's a hidden path. 
 You had to fall off a cliff to get there. Literally. 
 There was another sign of Alice as well. 
 What? 
 An altar. 
 It was in the same place where we got lost. 
 There's a connection between you and her. 
 Will you help us? 
 I'll let you know in the morning. 
 What, you think this face needs anything less than eight hours? 
 Bye-bye. Back to your shack. 
 What now? 
 You know when we said we needed help? 
 I don't do maternal and I don't do breakfast. 
 I think we get that. 
 Hey, Sam... 
 I'm sorry we didn't get home. 
 Sure you are. 
 Wanna see something? 
 Voodoo dolls. 
 Do you think they're magic? 
 I don't know. 
 Felix : Look, put 'em away. Don't want her to catch us snooping. 
 Sam, if science can't get us home, magic will. 
 You wanna know what I think? 
 I think we're gonna be stuck here for the rest of our lives. 
 Agh, Mia! 
 Mia! 
 I know that thing. 
 Demon :  Bring it to me. 
 I can help you. Morning. Were you just watching me sleep? No. We've definitely been spending too much time together. Good, because that's when you're strongest. The demon knows that too. Somewhere in here is the spell my sister cast. Find her. For all our sakes. How would I know which one it is? You'll feel it. A true witch can feel magic residue. You're a true witch? So she says. See something? No. Maybe I should take this and study it alone. No distractions. The book stays with me. Always. (Knock on door) (Sighs) (Knock on door) Who is it? Sergeant Riles, what a lovely surprise. Phoebe... Where are "your nephews"...? Ah, I don't know. Um, they're out, just, you know... Running and throwing stuff. Whatever teenage boys do. They should be at school. You know that, being such a devoted guardian. School. That's exactly where they are. What do you want them for? Trespassing. Let's go. Where? School. (School bell beeps) Bates : Oh, I despair of you, boys, I really do. I mean, what were you thinking? We have made every effort to make you feel welcome. And we appreciate your efforts, Mr Bates. But at every step of the way, your behaviour has indicated that you do not want to be part of this community. No! Really, we do want to be part of this world. More than anything. Not all of us. Sam. Some of us are sick of playing these whack games. Beg your pardon! Hey, Sam! I'm sorry, he's really upset. He misses his girlfriend. Honestly, I know it's taken us a while to adjust. But from now on, we will be model students. Yes, well, one more outburst like that and you'll be cleaning graffiti off the desks for the next month. Or three. Hey, Sam, wait up! What was that all about? You're all so desperate to fit in, but I'm not. Do any of you even want to go home? Of course. Well, it didn't seem like it in the forest. I do. I wanna go home and show my mum I can be a better person. So do I. I don't believe it. The break-up tree. She's dropping him. This is the only good thing that's happened since we've been here. Dude, I know he's your evil twin and all but... He looks kinda crushed. Mia deserves someone who will treat her better. I'm gonna see if she's OK. Better person, huh? Jake, hi. I'd just like to say thank you for sticking up for me on the bus. Oh, that's OK. No, no, really. I mean... It's the first time it's ever happened to me. Someone like you standing up for someone like me. I used to be just like those guys. This is for you. Really? A token of my appreciation. Um... I've got another one. Thanks. OK, bye. Hey, Mia. Hi. Hey. I... saw you and Sammy under the tree. Yeah. We broke up. I'm sorry. It's OK. It's been happening for a while now so... If you need someone to talk to, I've been going through some pretty crazy stuff lately as well. Sam, you're really sweet but I need to be alone right now. Sure. (Cawing) Science and magic are more similar than I thought. I'm convinced there's a combination of the two that brought us here. How? A magical act that ripped open a portal that brought us into this parallel universe. Maybe. There's spells about wealth... Fertility... Love, curses, wealth... Wealth. Come on, Alice, what about how to get rid of a demon of restoration? Aren't you supposed to be looking for Alice's spell? Our most immediate need is demon removal. There's something that keeps bothering me. That's funny, I'm being bothered by something too. Magic is governed by a strict set of principles - cause and effect. Kind of like science. Kind of. So then what's the cause? Why us? Maybe it's just random. Hey, I thought you were gonna proofread my new blog entry. Oh, sorry, I got side-tracked. You are cute when you get side-tracked. Do you remember the last time we were in here? It was so romantic. What, being attacked by wild dogs? No, before that. When the lights flickered. Oh, yeah... What if the power went out now? I hope not. This laptop has no back-up power supply. Oh... Don't mind me. I'll just sit over here and throw up in silence. 
 
 (Breeze) Hello...? Bates : If you remember, last week we were looking at dust mites, the choridea. So we're looking at life span from egg, through larvae, then obviously we have the hypopus. Thank you for joining us. And then there was, of course, the... Hey. What's happening to me? It is keeping you here. Destroy it and you will return to where you belong. But I can't. Then you will never go home. (School bell beeps) Bates :  Thank you, class. Right after lunch we will be meeting at the basketball courts for sport. So you can change into your sports uniforms at lunch and we will continue the fascinating story of the dust mite next week. Hey, Felix. Sorry about getting us into trouble with Mr Bates. Oh, it's OK. We covered for you. I went kinda crazy. There's been a lot of that happening. So that's the magic bling, eh? Mind if I try it on? It's probably better if I keep it... Come on, man. Just let me try it on. Felix, I don't think it's random magic. How do you know that? According to the rules of magic, a spell has to be cast by someone. The question is, what spell and who cast it? What's up? Hey guys, can we talk about this later? I have to meet Oscar and I'm late so... Curious. Why are you holding a unicorn? It's a gift. What's that book? It's my Book of Shadows. So you have your own spells? Kind of. Do any of them work? Hey, Oscar. Ellen's looking for you. She wants to interview you for her new blog. "Aliens among us". The truth will finally come out. Sorry, but the people have a right to know. Felix, you know you can trust me, right? Why? Something weird's been happening today. Weirder than normal? I just want you to know that this is the only way, and that one day, you'll thank me. Give it. Why are you being such a psycho? They have all failed. But you can succeed. Destroy the talisman and go back home, where you belong. Sam, don't! Was that the talisman? I think so. Sam, what are you doing? This thing. It's why we're here. Mate, what are you talking about? Mia told me. What's Mia got to do with it? The talisman is why we're still here. Mia doesn't know anything about magic. Does she? Well, if I blitz this thing, we'll all go back to our real lives. The talisman's protecting us, Sam. No, you don't understand. Mia's right. You'll see. (High-pitched tone) Poor Felix, all alone. We're still here. Jake : And defenceless. What have I done? Have I just killed us? I hope not. OK, Sam, get it together. Can this be fixed? Felix would know. He's in the old classroom at the back of the school with Mia. Let's go! Order must be restored. Oh, here to help your girlfriend finish me off? Traitor! Shut up, Felix. It was the demon. She's been possessed! I think I've worked that out. Just let me try something. Mia. It's me, Sam. I know this isn't you. There's something else in control. But you can beat this, Mia. Just don't be afraid. Fight it. I guess that wasn't part of the plan. We've gotta find Felix. Did he come in here? No, this is a detour. Time to make that thing run from us. Perfect. No, no, no, I'm sure it was like this. It allows for any combination. How do we know which one works? Cool your jets. The demon made me draw it. Felix. Felix! Didn't you hear me? Well, you're not exactly my most trusted bestie at the moment. Would this change your mind? You got it back. Why is it sticky? Probably the glue...? What...? There was  kind  of an incident. Perfect timing. Divinity of the Elements. Earth, Water, Air, Fire. I invoke Thee. It's not glowing! What did you guys do? Run! The auto workshop! Come on! Ellen : Mia! Hey, Mia! OMG. I heard about Sammy. You OK, babe? Babe. Just let me know if you feel like talking about it! I totally understand. Let's make a run to Phoebe's. We won't even make it across the road! We have to keep going. She's gonna catch us. Not if we catch her first. What now? Wait. Come on, come on. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! Get out of here, dude! She's got me. Help! She's got my legs. Help! Lose the pants! Get dacked or die! I don't know what's worse, being chased by a demon or seeing you in your undies. Let's not celebrate prematurely. Arcane Lane? Mind reader. (Bangs on door) I'll catch up. I can't leave Mia. I'll come with you. Be careful. Why... why have you got a unicorn? Mike gave it to me. A guy gave you a unicorn? What's wrong with that? Come on! Hello...? Sam, we've gotta go. She'll be fine. (Dog barking) I'm done. I won't be far behind. You know, it's weird. Demon Roland and Demon Mia could have killed the rest of us multiple times, but they only seem to be interested in you. I suppose the demon targets the greatest magic power. And the most interesting. A logical explanation. But still... See you in the morning. That's the connection. And this is our way home.
