 You want to win so much, there's a shortcut. 
 He's slipping! 
 Not everything out here is easily explained. 
 That's it! Wormholes. 
 We're the matter slipping between infinite variations of the same reality. 
 You boys have a demon after you. A bona fide, hell-bent on murder demon. 
 Ah! 
 You think my grandma tried to kill you? 
 I think the demon was controlling her. 
 Did you boys get these consent forms? 
 It's an excursion to the Bremin Ranges. Maybe we can find our own way home. 
 ♪ (Theme music) 
 Season 1, Episode 9 
 Good morning, bushwalkers. Ready to leave your comfort zones? 
 Andy, you made it. 
 Hand me your permission slips before you get on the bus. 
 Thank you, Andy. 
 Although I don't like the look of those clouds. 
 (Distant thunder) 
 What do you think, Andy? 
 It's just a little rain. 
 A storm is best observed from behind a window, Andy, not hiking in a forest. 
 The forecast is for isolated showers clearing. 
 Alright. Let's do it. 
 Yes! 
 It's all my fault. 
 What's your fault? 
 Us being here. 
 How exactly is that  your  fault? 
 Mr Bates was gonna cancel the school excursion because of the storm, but... 
 I told him it was clearing. 
 So you gave Bates a weather update? 
 I convinced him to go with a lie. 
 Because of me, we got lost and we ended up here. 
 Look, Andy, I was trying to win an imaginary race. 
 Felix lost the map, Sam fell down a cliff. 
 Who knows whose fault it was? 
 It was mine. And I need to fix it. 
 If you really think this is our only chance to get home, then today's the day. 
 Stupid rock! 
 And... keep the confessions to yourself. It's not gonna make anyone feel better. 
 No breakfast, again. 
 Sam : I'm starving. 
 Mostly blue sky. 
 Andy : The excursion should go ahead this time. 
 Sam : So what's the plan? 
 Retrace our steps...? 
 And get lost again? 
 No, we find the valley and the wormhole. 
 And how exactly does this work? 
 In this universe, the excursion was delayed. 
 What if the wormhole was delayed as well? We could find it again. 
 And you have trouble believing in magic? 
 It's worth a shot, dude. 
 We're supposed to be at Phoebe's this morning, remember? 
 Where we have to magically locate a missing person? 
 And you think  my  plan has problems. 
 Come on, Sam. 
 I thought you believed in magic. 
 And, Jake, you saw what happened with the dogs. 
 Andy's right. I mean, it's a bit of a long shot. 
 Magic or science... Which path do we take? 
 OK, let's vote. 
 Andy's solution? 
 Sam... 
 Sorry, dude. It kinda makes sense. 
 Alright. Let's go wormhole hunting. 
 Phoebe's gonna be really angry with us. 
 Phoebe! We need her signature. 
 What are you doing? 
 But that's forgery. 
 Bates wouldn't even know Phoebe's surname. 
 Haven't you ever faked a signature? 
 No. 
 Our fearless leader... 
 Mum. 
 (All groan) 
 (All groan again) 
 I'll never get used to that. 
 Ellen! 
 I recognise that stare. 
 "Mega-death." 
 She asked me to meet her yesterday but I got detoured. 
 You stood her up? 
 There is no known universe where Ellen forgives someone for standing her up. 
 I guess I just have to face the music. 
 Is that what Bear Grylls would do? 
 I'll help, dude. 
 Women are like puzzles and I am the great un-puzzler. 
 Hey! 
 Great. 
 Excited about the bushwalk? 
 Yeah, it should be fun. 
 We love nature. 
 Hey, maybe we could walk together. 
 Yeah. Maybe. 
 Or maybe not. 
 Oh, and Andy wanted to say something. 
 About yesterday... 
 I only waited for a small insect's lifespan. 
 He really is sorry about standing Ellen up. 
 You, I mean... 
 I know who I am. 
 He was just overwhelmed by your awesomeness. 
 I was...? 
 Well, tell him I was overwhelmed by his rudeness. 
 Mia! You coming? 
 Better go. 
 Bye, Mia. 
 Have you considered psychiatric help? Because you are a nut job. 
 And you're a jerk. 
 But Jake ate poisoned pickles. 
 Poisoned pickles? Really? 
 I'm sorry I let you down. 
 Thanks for letting me know. 
 He struck out. Why do I find that strangely satisfying? 
 And you say I'm competitive. 
 Hey, Jake! 
 You should join the team. 
 There's training after school tomorrow. 
 Maybe this reality isn't so bad. 
 Except we're living in a shed and we're always hungry and... 
 Oh, yeah, there's a demon tryin' to kill us. 
 But here, my brother can walk. And my family actually like me. 
 Don't you want to go home, Felix? 
 OK, take your seats, ladies and gents. Nature waits for no-one. 
 OK, give me your wrist, Sammy, and close your eyes. 
 A bracelet? 
 An anniversary gift. 
 Thanks, babe. 
 Do you like it? 
 Sure. Thanks. 
 It's so bizarre. It's like watching my evil twin. 
 Well, I guess this universe can be pretty confusing. 
 Which is why I can't wait to get home. 
 Haven't you ever thought, what if this  is  home? 
 Dude, seriously? 
 Didn't go so great with Ellen? 
 She hates me. 
 You never had a chance. 
 Why? 
 Because even under that terrible dress sense, there is a very cool girl. 
 Trent : Come on, try and get it! 
 Hey! Hey, give it back! 
 Get off! 
 Trent, Dylan, behave. 
 No! Stop it! 
 Hey, Jake, over here. 
 Over here. 
 You OK? 
 Alrighty, listen up. Welcome to the Year Ten Science Excursion which is quite literally a walk in the park - the Bremin Ranges National Park. 
 The pattern's repeating. 
 Felix, I know we haven't seen eye to eye lately, but you know Ellen better than anyone. 
 So... What would you do? 
 If I were you? Give up. 
 Seriously? 
 Seriously. 
 I'd tell her the truth. Just be honest with her. 
 In front of all her friends? 
 Absolutely. 
 There's nothing cooler than a public declaration of your feelings. 
 Good advice. 
 You are evil. 
 But hilarious. 
 Andy : Hey. 
 What now, Andy? 
 Ellen, I've never had a girlfriend before and... 
 Are you crazy? 
 Jake was sick. 
 That bit is true but the other truth is was that I was afraid to meet you. 
 Let's talk over here. Quietly. 
 I was afraid I wouldn't know what to do or say. 
 Kind of like now. 
 By the way, did I just do something totally humiliating? 
 Yes, but you did it in a totally cute way. 
 Wow, that's lucky. 
 Forgive me? 
 Forgiven. 
 Bates : Alright, Year Tens, listen up. 
 Form groups as I call out your names. 
 We have to stick together. 
 Mike, Sam, Tammy and Trent. 
 Bummer. 
 They can't put Mike with that meathead. 
 Focus. That's not why we're here. 
 Andy, Dylan, Christian and Cassie. 
 Ah, Sammy, Michelle, John, Ellen. 
 Boring. 
 See you after the walk. 
 Yeah, see ya. 
 Ellen? 
 Mr Bates : Daniel, Alexis... 
 Just in case I don't see you... 
 You're gonna hitchhike home? 
 No, but if I don't return... 
 Bates :  ...Which leaves Shirley, Madeline and Ryan. 
 Bates :  If I've already called your names, can you please get into your groups? 
 Bates :  Come on, now, get organised. 
 This way. 
 Just hop into your groups there, new boys. 
 The other Year Tens won't bite, I hope. 
 But if they do, they've all had their shots so... 
 Go! Run! 
 Stop there! I won't tell you again! Stop! 
 Why do I always fall for bad boys? 
 (Blows the whistle) 
 (Boys laugh) 
 Awesome! 
 Excellent. 
 Did you see the look on Bates' face? 
 Felix : I remember this place. 
 Oh, yeah, this is where Jake emptied out your backpack. 
 What is this? 
 Chicken's feet, obviously. 
 Yeah, I was a bonehead back then and I officially wanna say I'm sorry, Andy. 
 And Felix. 
 I was a bonehead too. 
 Less than him, though. 
 We've all changed. 
 I was a nerd, but... No longer. 
 (Thunder) 
 A sudden storm. 
 Like the last time. A confluence of repeating events. 
 Still a nerd. 
 We went that way, I remember. 
 Let's go. 
 Stay together. 
 (Distant thunder) 
 Sam : Home, here we come. 
 This has been the worst experience of my life. 
 I guess so. 
 Come on, man. 
 You mean you don't hate it here? 
 Most of it. 
 What!? 
 If I had to break it down, 60 to 70% - hate it, 17% - over-stimulated mainly because a girl likes me and 13 to 20% - kinda fun. 
 In my world, my mum works two jobs just to pay the rent. 
 I don't wanna drag her back into that. 
 Technically, Jake, she still exists in both places. 
 Well, my brothers here hate me and my parents have replaced me, so I 110% want to go home. 
 Come on. 
 This is where we went over. 
 I suppose we have to do the same again. 
 If we want to be scientific. 
 I don't remember it being this high. 
 Come on. We've done it before... 
 Accidentally. 
 Yeah, but you're a man of action now, right? 
 Yes. But there's action and then there's pure stupidity. 
 Let's do it. 
 Just psyching myself up. 
 Not fair! 
 What's up? 
 We can't be separated. 
 Ah! 
 Nice landing. 
 What happened? 
 Every time we separate, the talisman stops working. 
 Have you checked the batteries? 
 Ha-ha. I don't get you. 
 You believe in wormholes and every hare-brained scientific theory ever invented, but not magic. 
 Quantum physics can be proven. 
 What if magic's just science that hasn't been explained yet? 
 (Distant thunder) 
 Felix, where to now, huh? You were the map guy. 
 You said you knew the way, right? 
 This is where I lost the map. 
 And we went around in circles. 
 Pretty much. 
 Great. 
 You wrote down directions in your diary? 
 I write lots of things. 
 The storm's gathering force. Just like last time. 
 I vote we head towards it. 
 Yeah, that makes sense. 
 (Thunder crashes) 
 What does a wormhole actually look like? 
 A geometric tunnel that cuts through space and time. 
 Can't see one of those. 
 But I see one of those things again. 
 Maybe it has something to do with Phoebe's sister. 
 See, Andy? A sign of magic. 
 More like arts and crafts class. 
 You are going to be so embarrassed when I prove magic is real. 
 I am not! 
 Will you two just shut up... 
 Eyes on the prize, guys. Eyes on the prize. Come on. 
 (Thunders crashing) 
 Hurry, storm's coming! 
 This place looks really familiar. 
 Yeah, I remember it too. 
 Isn't that where we... 
 Spent the night? Yeah. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Come on. 
 We're going home! 
 Yes! Finally! 
 Whoa! 
 
 
 
 Are you OK? 
 Get us out! Andy, come on! 
 Get us out of here! 
 Guys, the talisman. 
 Take it easy! 
 Ow! Stop, you're making it worse! 
 Guys, I can't find it. 
 Andy, get this thing off us! 
 Help us out of here. 
 Wait. 
 Sam : Now, dude! 
 Sam : Get us out of here! 
 Something's coming. 
 Sam : Andy! 
 What? 
 I don't know! 
 Don't just stand there, come on! 
 Ah! 
 It's Roland, remember? 
 What are you boys doing back here? 
 We're trapped, obviously! 
 Not the desired outcome but a success, nonetheless. 
 Jake : Can you get us out? 
 Get on the other end of that net, kid. 
 Hey, guys? 
 (Jake groans) I'm soaked! 
 What a stupid place for a net to be placed. 
 So, Roland, why'd you decide to live in the forest? 
 Well, the thing is... 
 Jake : Stop playing around. 
 Andy : Roland...? 
 Sam : What the...? 
 Jake : What is it? 
 Roland, are you alright? 
 Get us out! 
 Roland, what's happening? 
 Sam : Let us go! 
 Sam : He's a psycho! 
 Where's the talisman? Andy, help me look! 
 Felix : Andy, we need the talisman now! 
 Jake : Felix! Andy! 
 Sam : Oh, no! 
 Andy, find the talisman! 
 Hey! 
 Ah! 
 Sam : Andy, get out! We'll take him! 
 Felix : Guys, get out of here! Leave me! 
 Jake : No, we're not going anywhere. 
 Andy : Look out! 
 Get out of here! 
 Sam : Andy! Help us! 
 Jake : Felix, run! 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee. 
 Earth, Water, Air, Fire. 
 Extreme lethal cage fight. 
 Go! Come on, Andy! 
 Aaargh! 
 (Shouts) 
 Felix : Andy, where's the talisman? 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee. 
 Earth... Water... 
 Come on! 
 Felix, say it now! 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee! 
 Felix : Earth... Water... 
 Air... 
 Fire. 
 Felix : Earth. Water. Air. Fire. 
 (Gasps) 
 (Coughing) 
 OK, magic totally exists. 
 What happened? 
 You were possessed. 
 What do you mean? 
 You were crazy, dude! 
 No, I-I can't remember. 
 What happened to him? 
 You happened to him. 
 Felix : I'm OK. 
 I warned you, boys. 
 This place is dangerous. 
 I can't... I can't stay here. I can't stay in this place. 
 That's cool with us. But we need to start a fire, like last time. 
 You boys can't stay here either. 
 Says who? 
 We were planning on staying the night. 
 Are you insane? This place is malevolent. 
 Strange stuff happens here. I know it. 
 Well, we're not leaving. 
 You may not have a choice. 
 What'd he mean by that? 
 Who cares? 
 What about you, brainy dude? (Chuckles) Demon slayer! 
 Felix, I was wrong, and I apologise. 
 Magic exists. I've seen it with my own eyes. 
 Hallelujah. At last. 
 Like you said, we haven't always gotten on. 
 Mainly because you're so... 
 Intelligent? 
 Yeah, intelligent. 
 But thanks for saving me, Andy. 
 It was this thing. 
 Is this the only thing that can protect us? 
 So far. 
 But the demon seems to get more powerful each time it manifests. 
 You know, there's still time to make the bus. 
 Are you kidding me? After all that? 
 Maybe it's not too late to see Phoebe. Andy, you've seen magic. 
 That's why we're here. Not wormholes. 
 We had a deal. 
 To spend a miserable night in an evil forest? 
 It's not going to get us home. 
 He may have a point, Sam. 
 The existence of magic is definitely a game changer. 
 No way. I'm not giving up. 
 Come on, Sam. Maybe Felix is right. 
 You go, then. I'm staying. 
 That's even more pointless. 
 Do you guys even want to go home? 
 Sam, we all do. 
 Well, it didn't sound like it. 
 OK, Sam, I'll stay with you. 
 Alright, I guess I will too. 
 Alright, then. 
 (Rustling) 
 What was that? 
 Is the demon back? 
 Worse, it's Bates. 
 Just what do you think you're doing? 
 Man, no! 
 Roland! What a traitor! 
 You've got my nulla-nulla. I need it. 
 You boys are in very serious trouble. You've ruined the excursion for everyone. 
 I have exhausted students on the bus back there, while you sit here and do what? 
 Make camp? 
 Just leave us here. 
 Well, that's not gonna happen. On your feet now. 
 (Booing) 
 And I wanna see the four of you tomorrow before class. 
 Andy. 
 Beautiful goal! 
 And Bremin takes the flag once again. (Laughs) 
 You do that again and I'll bounce that thing off your head. Got it? 
 Oh, and about the football...? 
 Not interested. 
 An altar and a tree with the same spiral pattern as the restoring demon. 
 Maybe it was left by Phoebe's sister. 
 Who disappeared in the same forest. Is there a link between her and us? 
 That's why I need to get her Book of Shadows, see if there is. 
 Magic is a whole new mindset. New rules, new... 
 Shh! 
 (Banging) 
 Police! Open up! 
 That's my dad again. 
 No sign of them. 
 Jake : Look out! 
 They're definitely staying here, Sarge. 
 Want me to check the bush? 
 No, I will. 
 Oi! Boys! 
 Jake! 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Come on, we know you're out there! 
 Whispering Voice : Sam. 
 What? 
 Andy : I didn't say anything. 
 Voice :  They don't understand what you're going through, but I do. 
 Let me help you. Sam... Come on. Come on!
