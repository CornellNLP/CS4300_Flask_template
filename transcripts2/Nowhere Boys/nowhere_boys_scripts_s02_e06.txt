 Is there a spell in here that can get us home? 
 You have to do something for me first. 
 If he helps me find Alice, she can get you home. 
 The remaining boys are now thought to be suspects in Andy Lau's disappearance. 
 Jake : Is that Forest Roland? 
 No beard, a suit... He's not Hermit Guy in this universe. 
 You're an Earth Element! 
 I'm confused. If Saskia's Earth, then why did the tracking spell work? 
 It's glowing, like before. 
 Ellen was outside the classroom. The missing Element's Ellen! 
 What is going on, Felix? 
 We need you to come with us... to help find Andy. 
 I've reworked the unmaking spell so we can travel between the universes. 
 So we're going to do a spell to go to another universe? 
 The same universe we were in when we went missing. 
 I hope that crazy isn't contagious. 
 Felix : Earth, Water, Fire, Air! 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 6 
 Are we there? 
 "There"...? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm not sure. 
 It's your backyard, Felix! The same one we were in one second ago. 
 What about that enormous storm? 
 The one that was there, and then now it's completely gone. 
 Nobody else thinks that's weird? 
 That's the mind-blowing weirdness of being in another universe. 
 If  we are in another universe. Felix, did it work? 
 This universe might look the same, but it isn't the same. Trust me. 
 (Gasps) So this is what crossing universes looks like. Impressive. 
 Just prepare to have your tiny mind blown. 
 Look! 
 It's Oscar's Valtirian cruiser. 
 Oh, is that the spaceship that transported us here? 
 THIS belongs to Oscar, the other Oscar. The one who belongs here. 
 See, it worked! It's Oscar's room, not mine. 
 Which proves what, exactly? 
 That we're in another universe. 
 Of course, why didn't I think of that? 
 Come on, we've gotta find Andy. 
 Er, hate to be a downer, guys, but what about the incredibly powerful demon that wants to restore us  out  of this universe? 
 This so isn't funny. I'm going home. 
 I wouldn't worry about it, Sam. That demon was only after Felix, remember? 
 Hilarious. 
 Come on, we've got to move fast. 
 Stay together. 
 (POP MUSIC) 
 (Both laugh) 
 Come on, Mia. 
 Ellen, wait! 
 We need to stay together. It's our only protection in this universe. 
 Newsflash, Felix - you changed bedrooms, not universes! 
 Come on, Ellen. I wouldn't lie to you. 
 No, you tell me the truth about everything. 
 Anyway, I've gotta be in a chat room - "Goths To A Flame". Remember, Felix? 
 That's where we hung out when we were friends. 
 Come on, man. 
 Where's the key? 
 (Both laugh) 
 I don't get it. 
 (Sighs) 
 Shouldn't we be checking Andy's house? The restaurant? 
 What about the school? 
 Why, so you can see if Mia still likes you? 
 No, Andy might have come back to see his girlf... 
 Um, I mean, you know, his special friend. 
 That uber-nerd has "a special friend"...? 
 Great, no signal. 
 Where are you going? 
 Somewhere there's better reception, so I can call my mum, and get a key. 
 Felix... 
 The demon knows we're here. 
 We'll come with you! You can use my phone. 
 Let's find Phoebe. 
 Phoebe : Good riddance. 
 Phoebe! 
 What...? 
 All this time, and not even a postcard? 
 By all this time, you mean a week? 
 Well, I missed you guys... vaguely. 
 We need your help to find Andy. 
 He went home with you. Why would he be here? 
 He did a spell, and disappeared. 
 Well, he's supposed to be the smart one. 
 Yeah, well, he had a fight with Felix. 
 None of these are working. 
 She came with us. 
 How? 
 Using this. 
 It opens doors between universes. 
 Well, that's pretty advanced magic. 
 Oh, please, don't you start. 
 Oh, dress sense improved, personality not so much. 
 You can talk! Feral, magic shop weirdo. 
 Why are you chucking this stuff? 
 Call me crazy, but finding out your sister is an evil demon... 
 Kinda puts you off magic. 
 If she's evil, why are you opening a taco van with her? 
 Look, we need to check the hide-out. Andy might be there. 
 How about I give you a lift? 
 I'm going to Mum's work. I'll see you later. 
 Ellen, trust me. 
 I'll show you where we were when we went missing. 
 It'll all make sense, I promise. 
 (Car horn honks) 
 (Sighs) 
 Sam : Andy! 
 Andy! 
 What is this place? 
 I told you I'd show you where we were for two weeks. 
 You're kidding? 
 Come on, let's check inside. 
 Hey. 
 Taco van? 
 Our universe's Alice came back when we did. 
 Is she OK? Have you spoken to her? 
 She's not a demon? 
 No, no. 
 And what about 'that' me? Must be happy to have her back. 
 I guess. 
 I mean, in my universe, you and I, we don't really talk. 
 So the other Phoebe's not a caring, sharing, maternal figure, like me, then? 
 It's so close to town. 
 You could've easily found your way home! 
 It wasn't that simple! 
 Man, being back here makes me starving. 
 Oh, really? Well, have this. 
 Andy's pawpaw ointment. 
 Wherever he is, I hope the nerd doesn't have itchy crotch. 
 So you were here the whole time? 
 I'm glad you told me the truth, Felix. 
 Now I know how selfish and immature you really are. 
 Ellen, wait! We are in another universe, OK? I'll prove it to you. 
 When we crossed universes, we got magic powers. 
 So now you're superheroes as well? 
 Ready? Watch. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Interpretive dance, I'm impressed. 
 Show them. Sam can make wind. 
 Oh, even more impressive. 
 (Grunts) 
 So stupid... 
 Felix, check this out. Chicken feet. 
 Ha-ha-ha. Still warm, awesome. 
 Andy's been here! 
 Looks like it. 
 Where's Ellen? 
 (Speaks indistinctly) 
 Falls for that... idiot! 
 (Screams) 
 Who are you? 
 What are you? 
 Detective...? 
 Hmm...? 
 What are you doing out here? 
 I'm hunting. 
 Right, because...? 
 Well, that's man's true purpose. 
 OK... 
 Look, I found out where the boys were when they went missing. 
 (Laughs) Welcome, the returning heroes! 
 Tell me it worked, mate. 
 You got your friends back home alright? 
 Yeah, it worked. 
 But we think Andy might have come back here. 
 Have you seen him? 
 No, not a cracker. 
 I'll keep a lookout though. 
 Of course, you will! 
 You're head of the police investigation. 
 Am I? 
 Oh... 
 (Laughs) 
 Chook's feet. 
 You know, someone's been dropping them everywhere around here. 
 Nainai's restaurant. 
 That's where Andy would get them from! 
 Thanks, Roland. 
 Ellen...? 
 "Roland"...? 
 Catch you. 
 (Hissing and screeching) 
 Sam : I don't understand why our powers don't work in this universe. 
 I've got a few suggestions. 
 Maybe it's because the Elements are against us here, not with us. 
 Which is why we need to move fast. 
 You guys look here, I'll check Andy's place; let's meet at school later. 
 Nobody thinks it's weird that the detective was behaving like a hobo? 
 Oh, yeah, wait, I get it - we're in another universe. 
 Sorry, I forgot. 
 Shouldn't the Roland here be the same as the one at home? 
 I definitely prefer this one. He's a lot less aggro, and he cooks! 
 But they should be the same. 
 Exactly. 
 Apart from us, and everything we've affected, it should all be identical. 
 Identical and delusional. 
 And it's not, because... 
 Hello! Enough chit-chat. Places to be. 
 I haven't figured that out. 
 Yeah, wow! 
 Detective Murphy having an alpha male hobby like hunting is a total shock. 
 The man carries a gun for a living! 
 Waiting! 
 I placed offering for ghost boy. 
 Important you feed ghosts, or they come back very angry. 
 So it was you who put the chicken's feet in the hideout? 
 Wherever ghost goes, he must be fed. 
 But you haven't seen Andy? 
 No. 
 You're sure? 
 You think my eyes no good? 
 See? 20/20 vision. 
 Viv...? 
 What  happened to you? 
 What happened to  you...? 
 I'm so glad you're here. You will not believe where I've just been. 
 Their whole missing in the forest story? Full-blown lie! 
 Not bad. 
 What? 
 That whole princess perfect thing you had going on was so... 
 Listen, Viv! The whole time they were gone, they were hiding in an abandoned shack. 
 They're up to something. Something bizarre. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I know. 
 Anyway, I'm gonna find out what really happened to Andy. 
 Andy? Who'd wanna see that nutter again? 
 But... 
 That guy was so creepy. 
 But he's your... 
 Ellen, what are you doing? 
 I was just... 
 Hey, loser, what are you doing in our kitchen?! 
 Viv, relax, OK? We're leaving. We have to go. 
 You were totally onto something. I'll let you know what I find out. 
 Cool makeover, by the way. 
 What makeover? 
 Man :  Could all class captains please meet at the principal's office at lunchtime? 
 Man, I really hope that Sammy loser isn't here; if I see his smug face, I'm gonna.... 
 If Andy were here, where would he be? 
 Library. Let's check it out. 
 What's with her? 
 Not sure. 
 
 
 
 Felix! 
 Hey, Oskie! 
 You can walk? 
 Oh, Ellen, is it Halloween already? 
 That costume's really scary. 
 How come you can walk? Since when? 
 Since I was 11 months and 6 days old. 
 No... 
 What are you doing? 
 What is she doing? 
 She's confused. 
 Right. Are you back for good? I'd be so cool to have a brother again. 
 "Again"?! Felix, what's going on? 
 Er... 
 Look, we're back to find Andy. Have you seen him? 
 No, sorry. 
 Boy : What is this? 
 Michael : Give that back! 
 Oi, leave him alone! 
 It's fine, I've got this. 
 Michael : Just give it back! 
 Way to go, Oskie. 
 Oskie : I think we talked about this, guys, remember? 
 Ellen : You unmade Oscar's accident? 
 Yes. 
 What, with an operation? 
 No, with magic. 
 As in rabbit-out-of-the-hat magic? 
 I know it sounds crazy... 
 No, it doesn't  sound  crazy, it  is  crazy! 
 The thing is, this Oscar isn't my brother. 
 What?! 
 I know, my brains hurt just thinking about it too. 
 Jake : Felix used a spell that unmade us. In this universe, we were never born. 
 Enough! Oscar was walking. 
 Can somebody please explain that to me? 
 Gentlemen, Phoebe told me you boys had gone back to your folks. 
 Er, yeah, we did, Mr Bates. 
 Then what are you doing back here? Outside of school hours, no less. 
 We just wanted to come back to... 
 To... 
 Try out for netball. 
 Since when do you boys play netball? 
 What position, Jake? 
 Wing defence, sir. 
 Right, and what about you two? Sam? Felix? 
 Ellen... We have to find her. 
 Great time for her to disappear. Again. 
 Boys...? 
 Sorry, Mr Bates. Netball calls. 
 Hey, hold on. I was talking to you. 
 Hey, stop. Just... 
 (Grunts) 
 Afternoon, Phoebe. 
 Still haven't seen them. 
 Teenagers don't just disappear into a forest. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 Sorry...? 
 Let it go, Gary. The boys are fine, back with their parents, like I told you. 
 What's all this? 
 Stocktake. 
 Looks like you're skipping town. 
 What, and leave all this? 
 Anything else, Gary? 
 I'll see you around. 
 Good to go. 
 That's  my  locker. 
 Girl : (Speaks indistinctly) Keep it up. 
 Where did she go? 
 Come on! 
 We've got to find Ellen. 
 Oh, no... 
 Jake : What happens when two of the same person from different universes meet? 
 I don't know, but it can't be good. 
 I'm Andy's "special friend"?! 
 Ellen...? 
 No, this can't be happening... 
 Have the boys come back with you? 
 What? 
 You're me from the other universe, right? 
 I'm not you! I'm me. 
 We're the same person. 
 We're not the same. 
 You're into blogging and boy bands. 
 And in your universe, Andy disgusts you, and your best friend is Felix. 
 How did you know that? 
 Andy told me. 
 Felix was right all along. This  is  another universe. 
 (Heartbeats) 
 No! 
 You OK? 
 This is... 
 Both : Seriously... freaky. 
 Hey, Jake. 
 The thing about sea monsters is you can't see when they're coming... 
 Oh, wow, you're back! I didn't think I'd see you again. 
 Did you miss me? 
 How could I, when I know there's a 'me' in another universe who's blissfully happy? 
 What...? 
 She dumped you? 
 Well, no. Not really. 
 Yeah, she dumped me. 
 But what would make you... I mean, her, happy? 
 Maybe it's just a timing thing. 
 I could always say when a unicorn's coming. 
 Right, 'cause they're colourful... 
 Of course, they've got a horn. 
 No way... 
 All : (In demonic voice) Order must be restored! 
 Both : Felix! 
 So you haven't lost the plot. This magic stuff is real. 
 Who'd have thought, right? 
 You could've told me I was a semi-pro netballer with a crush on Andy! 
 Don't know why I didn't. 
 Come on, Felix, we all know why. 
 We do...? 
 'Cause he likes you himself. 
 I'm still right here... 
 The demon's taken over the whole netball team! 
 How could you tell? 
 You could tell! 
 What's wrong with them? 
 I've got this. 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee. 
 Earth, Water, Fire, Air. 
 Elements that we all share. 
 Are you alright? 
 What did you just do? 
 It's not supposed to wear off that fast! 
 Oh, hey, I found the Book of Shadows... 
 OK, possessed netballers. And I thought team sport was character-building. 
 Phoebe, we can't stop. Any sign of Andy and the Laus? 
 Nothing. We need to find a safe place to get you guys home. 
 I know where. 
 What is she doing? 
 Outside, now! 
 Chase? 
 Both : Chase. 
 Maybe the demon's stronger now, that's why the talisman can't hold it off. 
 Phoebe, Jake, wait up! 
 Oh, great. 
 Gary! 
 Yeah, I was worried about you guys. 
 OK, now's not a good time. 
 That day in the forest... What happened? I can't remember. 
 No time! 
 What's the rush? 
 We have an entire team of netballers chasing us. 
 (Laughs) In your dreams, mate. 
 Cripes! What's going on there? 
 You guys better be off. 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Whoa! 
 Just stop right there. 
 Now, I don't know what you're playing at, but just cut it out! 
 Through him... Or around him? 
 Through him. 
 (Screams) 
 What's wrong with you, mob? 
 We need to make a circle. 
 Grab the sticks! 
 You have to do something for me before you go. 
 We need to get out of here! Felix, we have to go! 
 Sorry, Phoebe. 
 We made a pact, Felix! 
 You get my Alice back. I want my sister! 
 There's no time. 
 You promised, Felix! 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee... 
 (In demonic voice) Order must be restored. 
 Sam! Sam! 
 Through this world, we can see another place where we can be. 
 Phoebe, get off him! 
 Felix! 
 Take the fire, make it burn. Take the air, and make it turn. 
 Take this water and this earth, and to another world, call us forth. 
 Take the fire, make it burn. Take the air, and make it turn. 
 Take this water, and this earth, and to another world, call us forth. 
 Jake! 
 Girl : Where are we? 
 Jake...? 
 (Screeching) 
 Jake : How did you get here? 
 Is here where I think it is? 
 Felix is gonna freak. 
 One day with a normal dad - why is that so much to ask? 
 Because he's from another universe, Jake! 
 Don't you wanna send him home? 
 Jake's mum : What's got into you today? 
 (Laughs) Nothing. 
 I saw something when we were coming back. Something in-between. 
 Another universe? 
 No, it felt... 
 Different. 
 Ellen! 
 What are you talking to them about? 
 Ow, what are you doing? 
 Have they put you in some weird magic trance? 
 Help me! 
 (Thunder rumbling) 
 That is so cool. 
 Well, it must be your power manifesting. 
 Sorry, I should have warned you. 
 You think?! 
 Enough with the lightning! 
 Water's a conductor, right? 
 So? 
 And you and Andy are both Water Elements. 
 It could mean we can use that connection to communicate with Andy.
