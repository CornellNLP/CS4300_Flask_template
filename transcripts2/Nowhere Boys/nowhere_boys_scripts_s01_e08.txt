 What's that? 
 Felix : It's like a spirit force, or something. 
 Whoa. 
 Phoebe : Where'd you get that from? 
 Um... 
 Adults only. 
 Sam : She was that creepy woman from the forest. 
 I've got my eye on you. 
 Divinity of the Elements... 
 You're different, Felix. Are you the real thing? 
 Felix : Things like this keep happening. 
 Run! 
 (Growling) Oh, my God, it's WikiLeaks. 
 Divinity of the Elements, I call Ye forth. 
 What just happened? Felix? 
 ♪ (Theme music) 
 Season 1, Episode 8 
 (iPod music plays) 
 (Sighs) We don't do vampire books. 
 I don't want vampire books. 
 I want to learn about magic. 
 Sure you do. Over there. 
 This is kids' stuff. 
 What's in there? 
 That's the sealed section. Adults only. 
 I'm serious. My brother had an accident. 
 Oh, I've heard it before, kid. That's not how magic works. 
 You don't mend a broken arm with a spell. 
 But... 
 Hi. Do you sell things to make jewellery? 
 What kind of jewellery? 
 Bracelets and stuff. 
 Oh, that's nice. Yeah. 
 Phoebe : There's some down the bottom. You can put them on, like... 
 What are you doing in here? 
 I was just... looking. 
 I said this room was private. 
 Yeah, but... 
 What'd you see in this book? 
 Nothing. 
 You wanna know what I do to trespassers? 
 Something happened, dude. We all saw it. 
 What is that thing? 
 It's a talisman. Like a good-luck charm. 
 I got it from Phoebe when the attacks started. 
 Do you think she has something to do with us being here? 
 How is she connected to a wormhole? 
 Well, maybe it's your wormhole theory that's the problem. 
 Well, she's up to something. 
 I need to see her Book of Shadows. 
 Her what? 
 It's where witches keep all their knowledge and power. 
 If she's behind the attacks, the spells'd be in there, somewhere. 
 And if she's the one that brought us here? 
 That spell would be in the book, too. 
 Then we need to get it and make her bring us back. 
 This is Ellen O'Donnell from the internationally renowned blog, "Wot the Elle", reporting from Bremin High, where a pack of mad dogs went even madder. 
 There have been no injuries and everyone has been accounted for. 
 I can assure you that Bremin High will be open again tomorrow. 
 This is Ellen O'Donnell from "Wot the Elle". 
 That's www.wot.the.. 
 Don't let this influence your opinion of Bremin High, boys. 
 Only confirms it, Mr Bates. 
 And everyone look out for dog poo. It's everywhere. 
 Ew...! 
 I forgot to tell you with all the excitement, but we're having dinner at a Chinese restaurant tonight. 
 Mum wanted me to invite you. 
 That'd be great, I'd love to. 
 Cool, I'll tell her. 
 Bye. 
 What? 
 How come you're getting invitations to dinner? 
 What about the rest of us? 
 Sam : Yeah, we like food too. 
 Andy! 
 Let's not get side-tracked by your lover. 
 She's not my... 
 Wasn't that insane? 
 I've gotta interview you. 
 Want to interview me as well? 
 Um, why? This story is going to be huge. 
 It's exploding all over the blogosphere. 
 Can we talk? 
 Sure. 
 I'll catch up with you guys later. 
 But we have all that homework to do, at the magic shop. 
 The book...? 
 We've got all that stuff to do. 
 Yeah, serious important stuff. 
 Kind of urgent, Andy. 
 Ah... 
 This is where I live. It's quiet, so we can do the interview there. 
 Come around in an hour? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Bye. 
 I think she just asked you on a date. 
 Go, Andy! 
 Yay, Andy. Yay. 
 So now we sneak into the witch's lair to steal her magic book. 
 Jake and Andy, distract her in the shop. 
 Sam and I will sneak into the back room. That's where she keeps it. 
 Except when she keeps it in her bag. 
 So what's Plan B? 
 We follow her. 
 OK, let's go. 
 No, we'll go after her. 
 You guys go into the shop to see if you can find any clues. 
 If she is behind these attacks, she'll need things from us for her spell. 
 Like what? 
 Stray hair, some flaky skin. 
 Just as long as it comes from us. 
 You want us to collect bodily secretions? 
 There's a spare key under the pot plant below the wind chimes. 
 It's where she hides it in our world. 
 So hopefully that's one of the things that hasn't changed. 
 Come on, then. Eyes on the prize. 
 She could have snuck in while we were out and found things that belong to us. 
 How come you suddenly believe in magic? 
 If it gets us home, Felix, I'll believe in magic. 
 I'll get you home, Sam. 
 Is it still breaking and entering if you have a key? 
 We haven't broken anything so, technically it's just entering. 
 Tell that to the judge. 
 Man, I'm starved. 
 There's no single edible thing in here. 
 Jake, I think I've found what we're looking for. 
 Sam : Why would she come to your house, Felix? 
 I don't know. What's she doing? 
 Wait! Let's see what she was looking at. 
 Felix : This is where the crazy bee attack began. 
 Bees with their own tag. Cool...! 
 This pattern... It was around our hideout after the storm, and I saw it in her Book of Shadows that day we were in her shop. 
 So she IS the one behind the attacks...! 
 Maybe. 
 Hi, Felix. Did Oscar ask you about dinner tonight? 
 That's why I'm here. To say yes. 
 Do you like Chinese? 
 I eat it all the time. 
 Great. (Sneezes) 
 Hi, I'm Sam. I like Chinese food too. 
 We'd better go. 
 No, I'm in no rush. 
 Yes, you are. Bye, Mu... Mrs Ferne. 
 We don't want to lose her. 
 Fine for you. You've got a meal tonight. 
 I'll get you a doggie bag. 
 Hey, these look like pickles. Think they're edible? 
 Um, no. 
 Oh. 
 They're foul. (Spits) 
 There's four kinds of hair here. Maybe it's ours. 
 I thought you didn't believe in magic. 
 I don't. But I'm very goal driven and don't like under-achieving. 
 Maybe this is a clue to those scary crows. 
 Andy : Look at this. 
 Who is it? 
 A friend? A relative? 
 A victim? Ooh... 
 Red rag to a bull. 
 Watch this. 
 You're kidding me. Bear Grylls...? 
 Ninja... 
 Oh! 
 This is unexpected dedication, boys. 
 Hey, Mr Bates. 
 Um, Sam forgot his bag because of all the crazy dog action. 
 Is it okay if we get it? 
 Sure, but I'll be locking up in a minute. 
 Oh, did you get these consent forms? 
 They're for your guardian to sign. 
 Yeah, we're on our way to see her now so... we'll totally get these signed. 
 Where is she? 
 She's gone. 
 Locked. 
 Seriously spooky. What now? 
 I guess we get the others. 
 One sec. 
 Look at this. 
 Paw print? Part of it's been scraped away. 
 See there? I think I know what she's up to. 
 What? 
 She's gathering ingredients. 
 For dog pie? 
 For a spell! 
 See? I told you she was the one behind it. 
 She's probably heading back to the shop right now. 
 Jake and Andy are there. 
 (Groans) 
 It looks so easy on TV. 
 Here, give me a go. 
 Well, if I can't do it, I don't see how you... 
 Who da man? 
 What the... 
 I think that's supposed to be us. 
 Well... 
 This one's you. 
 (Door creaks) 
 (Clanging glass) 
 Jake! Andy! 
 Seriously...? 
 Earth, Water, Air, Fire. I invoke Thee... 
 What's going on, boys? 
 Stay back. We know you did it. 
 Did what? 
 Attacked us. 
 With dogs. Crows... Bees! 
 Hello! I'm the one who's been helping you. 
 Who gave you that talisman? 
 Don't trust her. 
 Maybe it's one of those reverse psychology things. 
 Yeah, that makes sense. 
 Prove you're innocent. 
 Show us your Book of Shadows. 
 Alright, fine. 
 Get that... 
 Be careful with this. 
 Still don't trust her. 
 Feeling's mutual. 
 That's the spell she used against us. 
 Just like you said, Felix. 
 It's not a spell, airhead. 
 This is the demonology section. 
 Demonology...? 
 I've been trying to work out what's been attacking you, and I think I've found the answer - you boys have a demon after you, a bona fide, hell-bent-on-murder demon. 
 Oh, man. 
 She's right. 
 These haven't just been elemental attacks. 
 It's the same thing in different forms. 
 What kind of demon is it? 
 There's more than one kind of demon? 
 From the signature, it looks like a restoring demon, created to restore the natural order after a magical disturbance. 
 What's a magical disturbance? 
 I'm thinking that's you. 
 You boys got something to tell me? 
 There was this school excursion, right? 
 And... and we got lost. 
 Andy... 
 I don't feel so good. 
 What's wrong? 
 I think... 
 I think that pickle... 
 Was poisonous? 
 We need to get you to a hospital. 
 But the closest one is miles away. 
 I don't know if I can make it that far. 
 I think this is as far as I can go. 
 Wait here. 
 
 
 
 Like clockwork. Nai-Nai! 
 Nai-Nai, please! 
 So... you're from another world, and you're in  this  world, where none of you were ever born. 
 That's what we think happened. 
 So can you help us? 
 Is there a spell in here that can get us home? 
 Hold on. 
 It's not that straightforward. 
 What do you mean? 
 You have to do something for me first. 
 Foot massage. 
 What you want, ghost boy? 
 Nai-Nai, I need your help. 
 My friend ate something that made him sick. 
 Not from my restaurant. I only sell fresh food. See? 
 Yes, I know. Every afternoon at this time you buy fresh vegetables for the night shift. 
 I also know that you trained as a herbalist. 
 So can you help him, please? 
 Nai-Nai, you always say that people in this country don't help each other enough. 
 Ai-ya! Every time I see you, you cause trouble. 
 Where is he? 
 Andy : Jake. 
 Jake, my Nai-Nai's come to help. 
 Stick out tongue. 
 Lift up. 
 Andy : Can you help him? 
 Who knows? Maybe too late. 
 That's really not what I wanted to hear. 
 What you stand there for? Help! 
 Ow! What was that for? 
 Too slow! 
 May be dying! 
 This is my sister, Alice. 
 Ten years ago, Alice disappeared. 
 The police searched for months. They never found a trace. 
 It's like she... never existed. 
 Like us. 
 What do you think happened to her? 
 Magic. 
 Alice is a powerful witch and... 
 I know she was working on a spell, and I think something went wrong. 
 Of course, the police thought I was crazy. 
 Well, you ARE pretty intense. 
 Thank you. 
 Alice... 
 Alice is still alive, I can feel it. 
 What spell did she cast? 
 All I know is that it was very powerful. 
 What do you want us to do? 
 Not you. 
 Him. 
 I need you to find the spell that Alice cast... 
 And reverse it. 
 If you've been trying for ten years, what chance have I got? 
 You can do magic, Felix. 
 And you can't... 
 I've studied magic all my life, but I've never had any real ability. 
 This is Alice's Book of Shadows. She's the witch of the family. 
 The only real witch I'd ever met... 
 Until you. 
 Are you a witch? 
 I've read some books and been on some websites, but that's what Goths do. 
 You made my sister's talisman work. 
 That's the first real magic I've seen since Alice vanished. 
 I repeated the same spell you said to me, except I used ingredients from my world. 
 Only a true witch can harness the power of the elemental talisman. 
 If Felix helps, can you get us home? 
 If he helps me find Alice, she can get you home. 
 OK, deal. 
 Don't I get a say in this? 
 Both : Nuh. 
 Tomorrow. Before school. 
 We'll be here. 
 If that demon doesn't get us first. 
 Keep the talisman close and stay together. 
 Restoring demons are tricky. Who knows what it's gonna get up to next. 
 Come on. 
 Here. This for cleaning bitterness. Has earth. 
 Ugh, that tastes like sludge. 
 It's good. Make you strong. 
 Oh, that's disgusting. 
 Good. It's working. 
 Actually, you kinda get used to it. 
 Thanks, Nai-Nai. 
 I'll meet you there in 15 minutes. I'm travelling as I speak. 
 Hey, you not finish yet! You need to change oil in deep fryer! 
 No way. Everytime I do, I smell like wantons for a week. 
 And why is my stalker here? 
 Now I have to go. I can't be around him. He's crazy. 
 I'm not! And I'm not your stalker. 
 Come back! You work tonight! 
 Always do this to me. 
 What if I work? In the kitchen? 
 What can you do? All you do is make trouble. 
 I know how to wash the dishes. Come on, you're short-staffed. 
 And tonight's your busiest night. 
 OK, I pay you four dollar an hour. 
 You pay Viv 15! 
 Six dollar. 
 12. 
 Eight. 
 Ten. And dinner for me and my friend. 
 (Sighs) 
 You take the food out of my mouth. 
 Why did you say that I could help her? I don't know if I can do magic. 
 If you didn't make the talisman work, who did? 
 I don't know. 
 Anyway, you'd better not be late for your family dinner. 
 Hey, why don't you come? 
 Are you sure? It's your family. 
 They'd want me to invite you. That's the kind of people they are. 
 Thanks, man. 
 (Faint howling) 
 (Faint growl) 
 Ooh, that looks delicious. 
 (Sneezes) 
 Hayfever again? 
 Should be fine. 
 I've dosed myself up with antihistamines. 
 Thanks for having me. 
 The more, the merrier. 
 You eat as much as you like, Sam. 
 Just nice to see Oscar with some friends. 
 Mum, you're doing it again. 
 Oscar's great. 
 You all are. You're like... My family. 
 You boys should visit more often. Stay for a weekend. 
 Done. When? 
 Do you think you're strong enough to help? 
 Almost. 
 Wow. Your gran's full on. 
 You should see her in a bad mood. 
 Now we clear the tables and start all over again. 
 You coming? 
 Have you noticed how Felix is the only one of us who's connected to his family? 
 Yeah. My family tried to incarcerate me. 
 Now they're using me as slave labour. 
 And my mum gets a headache every time I'm around. 
 Curious, isn't it? 
 Have you guys been practising magic? 
 Felix is going to. 
 Thanks, Sam. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I'm supposed to find a witch who vanished ten years ago. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. "Wow". 
 Can you use the talisman? 
 It's glowing. 
 Sam : How come? 
 Felix : I don't know. 
 What do you say to make it work? 
 "Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee." 
 "Earth..." (Echo) Earth. 
 ..."Fire..." (Echo) Fire. 
 .."Water..." (Echo) Water. 
 ..."Air." 
 Aah! 
 I must have forgotten to cut this. 
 Thanks, Lily. The service is always so good here. 
 Did she just... 
 ...Try to kill us? 
 Want a fortune cookie? 
 Ah, no, thank you. 
 I'm good, thank you. 
 You really think my grandma tried to kill you? 
 I think the demon was controlling her. 
 I saw her chopping a roast duck. 
 Since when is that a sign of demonic possession? 
 Guys, stop fighting. We may have just found a way home today. 
 What, Phoebe? 
 Sure, we're going home through Phoebe and her non-existent magic. 
 You're a real downer, you know that? 
 Magic is irrational and counter-intuitive. 
 Wormholes make more sense to me. 
 What's that? 
 Bates gave us these permission slips to sign. 
 We may not even need Phoebe. 
 What do you mean? 
 It's an excursion to the Bremin Ranges. 
 Again? 
 The same excursion? 
 In this world, the excursion was cancelled and rescheduled for tomorrow. 
 So if we go back and do it all again... 
 Maybe we can find our own way home.
