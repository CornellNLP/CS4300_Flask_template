 You can do magic, Felix. 
 You're a true witch? 
 So she says. 
 What's that book? 
 It's my Book of Shadows. 
 You have your own spells? 
 The spell has to be cast by someone. 
 The question is, what spell and who casts it? 
 See something? 
 No. 
 It's Jake, your son. Mum, what's wrong? 
 Mum, you OK? 
 Ugh, I feel horrible. 
 Argh! 
 You boys have a demon after you. 
 A bonafide, hell-bent-on-murder demon. 
 ♪ (Theme music) 
 Season 1, Episode 11 
 (Birds chirping) 
 Happy Mother's Day, Mum. 
 Ahh, thank you, sweetie. 
 Mmm. 
 Aw. 
 It's beautiful, love. It's beautiful. 
 It can go right over there next to the others. 
 Is today Mother's Day? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Every Mother's Day, me and my brothers always promise my Mum we won't fight for the whole day. 
 In our world, me and Mum would be getting ready for the game right now. 
 My Dad always tells me and my brother to make a card, and then my brother gives my Mum the card, and she cries. 
 Stop distracting me. 
 This is our only protection against the demon, and it's broken. 
 Yeah, thanks Sam. 
 I was possessed! 
 Did you find Alice's spell? 
 She's your best chance to defeat the demon. 
 Is she that powerful? 
 Yep. 
 I don't know what's taking you so long, Felix. 
 I stayed up all night. 
 Hey Jake, where did you put the brush and pan thing? 
 Oh, great. 
 Weren't we all supposed to stick together? 
 Well, technically without the talisman, why bother? 
 I was possessed, alright? 
 Guys, the demon could be back at any time. 
 And Jake's on his own. 
 (Sighs) 
 Ooh! 
 Whoops, there you go. 
 Oh, that was close! Thank you. 
 No worries. 
 You shouldn't even be up there. You're afraid of heights. 
 How do you know that? 
 Ah, Mr. Bates mentioned it. 
 He talks a lot, doesn't he? 
 So what are you doing back here again? 
 Oh, I thought I'd check up on you, 'cause you were like sick or something the other day. 
 Well, you're very sweet. 
 Your mother's lucky she has such a considerate son. 
 Ah, my Mum's not... around. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Oh no, she's not... 
 It's complicated. 
 Hey, do you want a job? 
 Sure. 
 What are we gonna do if the demon comes back? 
 We barely escaped last time when it was my girlfriend, and she's a pacifist. 
 Even though she was smaller, Demon Mia was stronger and faster than Demon Roland. 
 The demon is definitely evolving. 
 You never have good news, do you? 
 Well, the good news is every time we defeat it, the demon takes a while to get its strength back. 
 How long is  a while? 
 Not very long. 
 I wonder how it will change next? 
 I don't wanna know. 
 Breakdancing. 
 So what do you like at school, Jake? What's your best subject? 
 Football. 
 I'm a huge Bandicoots fan. 
 I know. I mean, everyone around here is, aren't they? 
 Oh, not Brian. He hates it. 
 Really? 
 Who do you go to the games with? 
 Oh, I don't go to the games. 
 But you always go. 
 Yeah, I used to. 
 How did you know that? 
 Where would Jake go? 
 What about his Mum's place? 
 Anyone know where Bates lives? 
 (Crowd cheers) 
 Mum. 
 Oh, man. This really sucks. 
 Oh man, my Mum makes the best sausages. 
 Not as good as my Mum. 
 My Mum's are awful. 
 But I eat them anyway. 
 Does anyone have any money? 
 Oh, yeah. I've got some left over from skate busking. 
 Job's all done. 
 How about we get something to eat? 
 Good? 
 Yeah. 
 Let me guess. BLT. 
 That's my favourite. 
 Oh, good guess, eh? 
 Let's see what I can do. 
 You're that boy that came to our house. 
 Yeah, sorry about that. It's kind of a misunderstanding. 
 Peculiar misunderstanding. 
 Um, yeah, I guess. 
 It's OK. I'm used to teenage boys and their secrets. 
 Um, happy Mother's Day. 
 Oh, thanks Felix. That's so kind. 
 Like some sauce? 
 Yes, please. 
 You know, Oscar would love it if you'd come over and stay for the weekend. 
 That'd be great. 
 If it's alright with your Aunty. 
 I'm sure I could convince her. 
 No, you're not. 
 I'm your son! 
 You're not. 
 I am. 
 You're not. 
 Well, how's the family? 
 We haven't had any break-ins recently, so that's a plus. 
 Is Nai-Nai still hiding her glasses because she hates them? 
 How did you know that? 
 Bottom dresser drawer, second living room. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm your son! 
 What is it? 
 I feel sick. 
 (Sneezes) 
 What's wrong? 
 Stupid allergies. 
 Are you OK? 
 I don't feel well. 
 Maybe you should take a seat. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. 
 You okay? 
 Call an ambulance. 
 Sarah? 
 Sarah? 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Sarah...? 
 Nice... 
 Mum! Mum! 
 Mum, wake up! 
 (Gasps) 
 Mum, please wake up! Wake up... 
 There's something wrong with all of them. 
 What is it? 
 The sausages...? 
 Demon attack. 
 Is she gonna be OK? 
 We'll have her in emergency in no time. She'll get the best care possible. 
 Can I come? 
 You family? 
 No... 
 Bates : What's going on? 
 Sorry, mate. We've gotta get moving. 
 Jake, what are you doing here? 
 Sarah? 
 Sarah! 
 All Boys :  Phoebe, Phoebe! 
 What is it with the teenage boys always shouting? 
 Something's happening to our Mums. They're really sick. 
 First the bees, then the dogs. Now the demon's attacking our mums. 
 On Mother's Day! It's pure evil. 
 OK, boys. Let's hit the books. 
 They all had rashes on their arms, like they were fighting something toxic. 
 There's nothing in here about the demon attacking blood kin. 
 Did the rash have a spiral pattern? 
 Definitely not. 
 Then it may not be the restoring demon. 
 You're right. 
 What other demon could it be? 
 Is there a banishment spell in here? 
 What if it's not a demon? 
 What else would it be? 
 This has been happening since we first came here. 
 Every time we're around our Mums. 
 My Mum started sneezing when she saw me. 
 Yeah, my Mum's had that rash before. 
 It's like our mothers have become allergic to us. 
 Magic hayfever? Bummer... 
 So, what do we do? 
 Magic antihistamine. 
 Of course! 
 If our mothers are allergic to us, it's because we shouldn't be here. 
 We're like foreign bodies to them. 
 But what if we could connect to them with magic, so we don't seem foreign anymore? 
 Like magical inoculation. 
 Genius. 
 Really? 
 Really. We need a spell. 
 Don't we need the talisman to work? 
 Not necessarily. 
 I mean, if we can find another object with magical properties... 
 This isn't right. 
 But if we can add a bit from here, we might have something. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 No, it's just my diary... thing. 
 Why has it got magic spells in it? 
 I write everything down. 
 We're wasting time. Is anyone interested in putting this spell together? 
 Yes. What ingredients do you need? 
 Guys, I need your help. 
 This is a healing spell combined with a protection spell. 
 Will that work? 
 If we activate it with powerful ingredients. 
 Like us? 
 No, this time we need more. 
 It's about us and our mothers. 
 So we have to find objects that belong to them, but we also have to connect to them, like forging a link. 
 So things that exist in both worlds? 
 Exactly. 
 My Mum's got a completely different life here. 
 She doesn't even live in the same house. 
 There must be something she still has. 
 Dolphins. Even when she was a little kid. I bet she still collects them. 
 We don't have time to do this together. We have to split up. 
 If you save our mums, dude, forget everything I said about you. 
 About being a freak. You're cool. 
 Let's meet up at the hospital. We have to be nearby for the spell to work. 
 Let's do it. 
 Come on, come on... 
 Where are you? 
 
 
 
 Nurse : Do we know what's wrong with these women? 
 Can we do an IV check? 
 Ah. 
 She never puts anything where you expect to find it. 
 What you want, ghost boy? 
 Mum's sick, Nai-Nai. They've taken her to hospital. 
 That girl! Always something wrong with her. 
 Ah, Sir Weed Killer, we meet again. 
 I need a photo of grandad. 
 What for? 
 A magic spell. 
 Oh, OK. 
 Here. 
 Thanks, Nai-Nai. 
 No problem, ghost boy. 
 My Mum always said I look just like my grandfather. 
 Yeah, in about 60 years that'll be you. (Laughs) 
 What'd you get? 
 I got my Mum's favourite book, I got her favourite CD, the paintbrush she uses, a pair of running shoes 'cause she likes running, and an egg timer. 
 Why? 
 I don't know, I got confused. 
 Well, you better pick one. 
 We have to prepare the spell and we're running out of time. 
 Where's Jake. 
 I don't know. 
 But we need him or the spell won't work. 
 I've just found something magical, and now you want me to find Jake? 
 Alright, alright. 
 Has there been any response? 
 Afraid not, Doctor. 
 I've never seen anything like it. 
 I know. We've got another one. 
 She's got the same symptoms. 
 It could be an allergy. 
 What is going on out there? 
 The Doctor's going to be here in a sec. 
 Have we found any possible environmental causes? 
 Nothing at all, Doctor. 
 They're getting worse. 
 Stabilise her condition. 
 Come on, where are the dolphins? 
 Thanks, Mrs Smith. I'll check it out. 
 OK. 
 It's all new. 
 Come on, Flipper. Where are you? 
 (Car engine starts) 
 Jake, where are you...? 
 I've never seen anything like it before. 
 It's like their immune systems have gone berserk. 
 It is us. We've done this. 
 Where's Jake? 
 Maybe there's another spell. 
 We don't have time to start again. 
 What took you so long? 
 I got it. 
 Let's not get interrupted. 
 This tablet belonged to my sister, Alice. 
 I've never actually used it. 
 That's good. 
 I mean, now we all have something here from our families, so maybe it'll make the spell stronger. 
 Let's hope so. 
 Wow, are you being nice? 
 It'll wear off. 
 What happens now? 
 We all say why each thing is special. 
 Is that even a proper spell? 
 Yes. 
 Who wants to go first? 
 My grandad died a long time ago, and this is the only photo Mum has of him. 
 When I was a boy, Mum used to tell me about his adventures. 
 He was like a Chinese Bear Grylls. 
 This is my Mum's favourite paintbrush. 
 I thought about when I see her and she's most happy. 
 Most of the time it's when she's painting. 
 She gets this look on her face like nothing can ever touch her. 
 My Mum's crazy about gardening and this is her favourite tool. 
 She calls it Sir Weed Killer. 
 Especially after Oscar had his accident, the only time she seemed happy was when she was in the garden. 
 I guess my Mum doesn't like dolphins so much in this world. 
 But I found this instead. 
 My Mum got this brooch from my Dad on their first date. 
 They went to a footy match and the Bandicoots won. 
 My Dad's an idiot in our world, and this is the only piece of evidence I have to show that they ever cared for each other. 
 OK, everybody hold hands. 
 (Monitor beeps irregularly) 
 (Monitor flatlines) Nurse! 
 Earth, Water, Air, Fire. 
 Upon this tablet, I invoke Thee. 
 Your strength, Your power to heal. 
 While this tablet remains at hand, our mothers shall be safe throughout this land. 
 Felix! Felix! He's fainting. 
 What's going on? 
 Doctor! Doctor, quickly! 
 What's going on? 
 Mrs Ferne, are you OK? Can you hear me? 
 Jake : Hey man. 
 Andy : Great. 
 Sam : How're you feeling, magic dude? 
 Felix : Like a truck ran me over. 
 You were awesome. 
 I heard what happened. Is she alright? 
 I don't know. 
 Mr. Bates. 
 How is she? 
 We don't know what happened, but she's stabilised and it looks like she's gonna be fine. 
 Can I see her? 
 Of course. 
 Oh, just immediate family. 
 Are you sure there's nothing I can get you? 
 Oh no, I just need to sleep. Thanks. 
 OK. 
 Happy Mother's Day? 
 (Yawns) 
 Could it happen again? 
 I think your Mums are safe for now, thanks to you boys. 
 But the demon will be back, more powerful than before. 
 Thanks for that. I definitely won't be having any nightmares now. 
 Anyone seen my diary? 
 You mean your Book of Shadows? 
 Interesting reading. 
 Give it back. 
 Didn't you say that every spell a witch ever casts can be found in their Book of Shadows? 
 Yeah, Felix, didn't you say that? 
 I didn't mean to do it. 
 Didn't mean to do what, Felix? 
 Hey, don't gang up on him. 
 He saved the day, alright? 
 After he put us in danger in the first place. 
 What? What happened? 
 You know how we're here because of a magical event? 
 Yeah. 
 Felix is that event. 
 What? 
 I'm really, really sorry. 
 Tv :  ...Isolated on tropical islands. 
 It is as beautiful as it is dangerous. 
 With an abundance of natural predators, both land and sea, and a severe monsoon season that brings with it frequent cyclones. 
 There is little question as to why it has remained relatively... (Groans) Sarah :  Brian, is everything OK? (Demon voice) Everything's fine, honey.
