 In my world, you and Sarah had a kid when you were teenagers - me. 
 When you see the other me, show her this. 
 Don't you recognise it? 
 Don't think so. 
 Tell me what I'm looking at. 
 A Mexican cafe on wheels. 
 I want every available car to be looking out for an Andy Lau. 
 We think Andy might be in the other universe. 
 Why don't you let us find out what's going on? 
 If it really is something bad, then you should go to the cops and we'll come with you. 
 The missing Element wasn't Saskia, it's Ellen. 
 We need you to come with us, to help find Andy. 
 Felix was right all along - this IS another universe. 
 What about that incredibly powerful demon that wants to restore us out of this universe? 
 Order must be restored. 
 And to another world, call us forth! 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 7 
 Did anyone else see that weird place? 
 What place? 
 I didn't see anything. 
 I've got to get out of here. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah, sure. Pretty average day, really. 'What did you do today, Ellen?' 'Oh, you know, just visited another universe.' 
 I know it's a head spin. 
 I've got to get home. 
 I've got to go after her, see if she's OK. 
 What about Andy? How are we going to find him? 
 I'll figure something out, OK? 
 Ellen! 
 Don't follow me. 
 Come on, Jake. Let's get out of here. 
 Gary : Where'd they all go? 
 (Thunder) 
 Can I help you? 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 You look familiar. 
 So do you... 
 Andy has to be there. The tracking spell said so. 
 The tracking spell showed he wasn't here. That's different. 
 So he's not here and he's not in the other universe, where else is there? 
 I don't know. 
 I saw something when we were coming back. 
 Something... 
 In-between. 
 Another universe? 
 No. It felt... 
 Different. It's hard to explain. 
 (Computer bleeps) 
 Help me! 
 Whoa! What is that? 
 I don't know, but it's getting bigger. 
 You have to do something! 
 That is so cool. 
 It must be your power manifesting. 
 Sorry, I should have warned you. 
 You think? 
 (Thunder) 
 Enough with the lightning! 
 Looks like it's responding to your mood. 
 I'm coming over; just keep calm. 
 Yeah, sure. There's only a storm in my bedroom! 
 OK, see you after work. 
 Bye. 
 I was worried about you. 
 I was going to call. 
 I don't have a phone. 
 Really? 
 I know everyone does, but... 
 Did you find your friend? 
 You will. 
 I wish I didn't mess things up. 
 It's not your fault. 
 You just weren't the right Element, that's all. 
 You're still magic. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Better get that. 
 Um, come in? 
 Hello? 
 No, she's not here. 
 Yeah, this is Jake. What's up? 
 Just get your hands off me! 
 I'm an officer of the law. 
 Roland : Oh. What does that make me? 
 Is that your father? 
 Kind of. Not really. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 You just count yourself lucky that you're not under arrest. 
 Gary! I mean, Dad. 
 Jake, can you explain to this man... 
 I can. 
 He's on his way to Griffo's fancy-dress party later. 
 What? 
 You love fancy dress. Come on. 
 Right. 
 Must have made a mistake. 
 Might be best if you let your mum deal with this one. 
 It's OK, I'm used to it. 
 Come on, Dad. 
 How did you get here? 
 Is  here  where I think it is? 
 Remember when I told you you were my father in another universe? 
 It's bad luck to open umbrellas indoors. 
 Except when attacked by weather. 
 Amazing. 
 I'm so glad you like it. 
 You and Andy share the same Element, but your power manifests differently. 
 Never mind that! How do I turn it off? 
 You don't. 
 So I'm stuck with a pet cloud? 
 You're stuck with the power. (Thunder) 
 The cloud, you might be able to control. 
 "Might"...? 
 Here. 
 Take my hands. 
 Do you know what you're doing? 
 Would you feel better if I said yes? 
 Close your eyes. 
 Concentrate on my voice and blue skies. 
 Think of calm, blue skies. 
 Think of something really calming. 
 Like what? 
 You're at a gig. The music's pumping and you're dancing. 
 (Thunder) 
 Sorry. Ah, I mean... 
 You're watching other people dance... 
 But you're making fun of them. 
 We're making fun of them together. 
 Reopen your eyes. 
 It's gone! 
 Amazing. 
 Better go. 
 Call me if... 
 What's the matter? 
 Water's a conductor, right? And you and Andy are both Water Elements. 
 So...? 
 Different universe? 
 Everything looks exactly the same. 
 Except for you. I don't remember you. 
 I'm new. 
 So I'm not a cop in this universe? 
 Yeah. I guess things got in the way here. 
 Having a great kid? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 And Sarah, is she here? 
 Yeah, but she's different. 
 Different, how? 
 Well, she doesn't live in a big, fancy house in this universe. 
 It's just me and her. 
 Does she laugh a lot, does she still like pop music? 
 Is she... happy? 
 She's not a real-estate agent. 
 Sure I can't just have a quick look around? 
 This kind of thing doesn't happen every day. 
 Trust me, you're safer here. 
 I'm safe with you here too. 
 Jake? 
 Yeah? 
 Good to see you, son. 
 Wow. It must be strange to have two dads. 
 This one's not technically my dad. 
 Do you want him to be? 
 I've got to tell Felix. 
 Answerphone : Hiya, this is Felix. Speak now or forever hold your peace. 
 You didn't leave a message. 
 Maybe we can hold off for a bit. 
 One more day shouldn't hurt. 
 (Sport on the TV) 
 These the only clean clothes you've got? 
 Cleanish, mate. 
 Aren't you a bit old for making scarecrows? 
 It's for a school project. 
 Yeah! That's the way you do it. 
 Yeah... I've got a game coming up this weekend, if you wanted to come. 
 Yeah, sure, mate. I wouldn't miss that. 
 Unless, of course, your car breaks down or you sleep in again and forget. 
 Go, boys! (Laughs) They're playing a blinder today. Whoo! 
 Hey, mate, could you just pass us that drink? 
 You're quiet today. 
 I'm alright. 
 Thanks for the new duds. Red really is my colour. 
 You think so? 
 Handsome is in our genes. 
 You sure your dad won't mind me borrowing them? 
 He won't even notice they're gone. 
 He's a good bloke though, good dad? 
 You've almost made this place look liveable. 
 We have. Pretty handy on the tools, such as they are. 
 So how long are we gonna be here, should I start thinking about some indoor plumbing? 
 Well, there are some complications. 
 Complications...? 
 Just logistics. 
 This whole undoing-magic stuff can take a bit of figuring out. 
 It just gives us more time to hang out. May as well make the best of it. 
 Alright, coffee break's over. Chuck us up some of those nails, will you? 
 Sorry. Got caught up. 
 Dude, you're a mess. 
 Um... Jake was helping me with some gardening. 
 
 
 
 OK, so I've got a theory. Ellen and Andy are both Water Elements. 
 So? 
 Well, it could mean we can use that connection to communicate with Andy. 
 Like a multidimensional video call. 
 I hope the reception's better than Bremin's wi-fi. 
 Yeah. I spent last night retooling the tracking spell to work across different universes. 
 So is this something you could do solo? 
 Why would you do that? 
 I need all of us. 
 Viv : Ellen! 
 Ah, go! 
 We have to stick together. The spell! 
 I won't be long. 
 What are you talking to them about? Did you find out anything? 
 Not yet. 
 Where were you yesterday? 
 You were supposed to come to the police with me. 
 Yeah, sorry. I got held up. 
 That detective won't listen to me. He thinks I'm just a kid. 
 You are just a kid. 
 But you're a witness. 
 You found the print-outs to those spells. He'll listen to you. 
 Ellen, we have to go - now. 
 Go where? 
 Science presentation. 
 Ow! What are you doing? 
 Have they put you in some weird, magic trance? 
 Ellen! Come on. 
 Ellen, it's important. 
 I'm sorry, Viv. 
 Sam : Hello! Anyone in here? 
 Well, hang on - remember what happened last time? 
 We've got all the right elements now. 
 We can't risk the spell going wrong. 
 You are the expert of spell fail. 
 Felix is right. 
 I'll keep lookout. 
 Nice one. 
 Sam, fill the sink. 
 We're gonna talk to Andy out of a sink? 
 Better than a toilet. 
 Everyone ready? 
 Not really. What do I do? 
 Just keep calm and concentrate. It'll be OK. 
 Across the divide, let water fall. 
 Bind like Elements, hear our call. 
 Bind like Elements, hear our call. 
 Bind like Elements, hear our call! 
 Maybe he's engaged. 
 Something was happening. 
 The link's not strong enough. 
 I think we need something connected to Andy  and  Ellen. 
 What about that necklace - the one Andy gave me? 
 It's crossed universes, you've both owned it, that's perfect. 
 Well, where is it? 
 Bates is on the warpath - something about science presentations. 
 We'll have to get it after school. 
 I've got to be somewhere after school. I'll catch up with you. 
 What's so important? 
 We're in the girls' bathroom. 
 Can we just go? 
 Andy's the priority. 
 Once we get that sorted, I'll tell the others about this Gary. 
 Don't you want to send him home? 
 Gary...? 
 'Gone exploring. Promise I'll be careful.' 
 Oh, no... 
 We have to find him. 
 Find who? 
 Don't you remember where you put it? 
 I didn't really like it. 
 Mum's tried to give me jewellery like that before. 
 It's so... Nanna. 
 Maybe Mum thought it was hers. You check her room. 
 I am not going through your mum's undies. 
 You're not going through mine! 
 Check her jewellery box on the dresser. Look for the ugliest necklace you can find. 
 Don't tell her about it, please. 
 So this whole time, you've been hiding a second father? 
 I was gonna tell you, as soon as we found Andy. 
 Felix is gonna freak! 
 One day with a normal dad - why is that so much to ask? 
 Because he's from another universe, Jake. 
 No sign. Maybe he went into town. 
 We have to tell Felix. 
 OK. 
 Both : Found it. 
 OK, that's weird. 
 Same object, from two universes. 
 So Mum must have had that one all along. 
 (Mobile rings) 
 What's up? 
 OK, don't freak out. 
 About what? 
 The other Gary is here - cop Gary. 
 Where is he? 
 We think he might have gone into town. 
 We're on our way. 
 We have to go. 
 What...? 
 What just happened? 
 The same object from two universes... 
 Maybe if they touch... 
 They cancel each other out. 
 Like matter and antimatter. 
 How do you know that? 
 I listen in Science class. 
 We've got a big problem... 
 Two Garys. 
 Phoebe :  Hola . Mexican soda? 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 Hola . Mexican soda? 
 This is your place? 
 Yep. Why? 
 Nothing, just didn't think you were the hospitality type. 
 Do we know each other? 
 Looks great. What's in it? 
 Lemonade. 
 And...? 
 A straw. 
 Sure. 
 Hi! What are you doing here? 
 You alright? 
 Got you a drink. 
 Oh. They're good, aren't they? 
 Everything about this place is... 
 Fantastic. 
 Are you sure you're OK, Gary? 
 Never better. 
 OK. 
 (Slurps) 
 Thanks. 
 Ahem. 
 Gary! 
 Yeah? 
 How'd you get here? What happened? 
 I walked, with my legs. 
 Checking out the new Mexican van. 
 It's not him. 
 Jake, what's going on? 
 Dad, you need to go home. You can't stay in town. 
 Why not? 
 Maybe you left the oven on. 
 People do that. 
 My oven's broken? 
 But the neighbours can smell gas. 
 Oh. I had baked beans for lunch. Now I'm going to have some Mexican! 
 Come on - that was funny! 
 Get him home, now. 
 Tell us another joke. 
 Gary : You crack one bad joke and your son's embarrassed of you. 
 How long has he been here? 
 Not long. 
 How long? 
 Since last night. 
 I was gonna tell you! 
 Do you know how dangerous this is? 
 If he meets the other Gary, they'll destroy each other. 
 What? 
 Mexican soda? 
 Rude! 
 How could I forget? You, a karaoke machine and Wa Wa Nee. 
 What's got into you today? 
 I don't know. I feel like a new man. 
 We need to get him back. 
 I know. 
 Dad? 
 Ah, Jake. Hi. 
 Jake, have something to eat with us. 
 I'm sorry, Mum. We've got to go. 
 OK. 
 Oh! Where? 
 You can't do this. 
 I wanted to talk to her. 
 Felix : You can't. This universe doesn't want you here. 
 (Thunder) 
 Saskia : So what's the plan? 
 Felix : Send him back. 
 Gary : Can you do that? 
 I'll need the others, and this. 
 What's happening? 
 It's a restoring demon. 
 Order must be restored. 
 Get it? He's eating a pomegranate! 
 What's wrong with you two? 
 That was hilarious. 
 That thing with the eyes, it's happening to him. 
 Order must be restored. 
 Felix, the talisman. 
 It won't do anything without Ellen and Sam. 
 What do we do? 
 Run. 
 Gary, give it back. 
 You have to give it back! 
 Where is he going? 
 If they touch, they'll cancel each other out. 
 Stop him! 
 Jake! 
 Felix! Do something. 
 Do something! 
 Gary, stop! 
 Dad, it's me. You can't go near him. You have to stay away. Don't touch him. 
 Delay them while I get the talisman. 
 They're gonna touch! 
 Keep going! 
 I'll hold him down. 
 The talisman, the talisman! 
 Hurry up! 
 I am! 
 Draw a circle around cop Gary. Quickly! 
 Jake : Sam! Help! Use your power. 
 Ellen : Sam! Cop Gary's out of the circle! 
 He has to be in the circle! 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee! 
 Return us all to where we should be. 
 Take this earth, fire, water, air. 
 Universe will reclaim and repair. 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee! 
 Return us all to where we should be. 
 Take this earth, fire, water, air. 
 Universe will reclaim and repair. 
 Gary, it's OK. 
 Reclaim and repair. Reclaim... 
 Jake...? 
 You're going home. 
 Reclaim and repair! 
 (Whoosh) 
 Guys, look, over there. 
 It's that place. 
 Andy...? 
 Andy! 
 Next time 
 Looked like that place I saw between the universes. 
 Ellen : What's that? 
 The other you made it for Andy. 
 The other me is sick-making. 
 Where's the talisman? What about Saskia? 
 She must have taken the talisman. 
 Why would I do that? 
 I told him it was crazy. 
 Where is she? 
 Andy : What is this place, how do I get out of here? 
 This is your home now, Andy. Don't you know that?
