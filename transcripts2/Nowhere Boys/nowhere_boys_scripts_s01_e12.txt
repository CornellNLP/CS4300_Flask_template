 Roland, are you alright? 
 Woman :  Ryan, is everything OK? 
 What kind of demon is it? 
 From the signature, it looks like a restoring demon, created to restore the natural order after a magical disturbance. 
 Destroy the talisman and go back home. 
 The talisman's protecting us, Sam! 
 Mia's right! You'll see. 
 (Thunder cracks) 
 I need you to find the spell that Alice cast and reverse it. 
 If what's attacking us comes from another world, then we need to use elements from another world. 
 Jake - practical, stubborn, brutish. Earth. 
 So, the other boys are the other elements! 
 You know how we're here because of a magical event? Felix IS that event. 
 Sam : What? 
 ♪ (Theme music) 
 Season 1, Episode 12 
 Random groups of four, which I'm sure you'll be all very happy about. 
 Now, in front of you you have the flora and fauna logs, which you are to take with you on the walk tomorrow. 
 Please don't forget them. (Bell chimes) 
 Make sure you are punctual tomorrow, please, people! 
 Bus leaves at 9am sharp. 
 Action stations. 
 Watch it! 
 Mr Bates, I'm heaps freaking out. 
 Speak English, please, Ellen. 
 Well, I heard that a panther escaped from a circus in that forest. 
 Ah, that's an old myth, Ellen. Not too much to worry about. 
 What if it eats my face off? 
 Let's risk it, shall we? 
 OK, Year 10s, form groups of four as I call out your names. 
 Mia, Trent, Dylan, and Ellen. 
 I thought we were together! 
 He must have changed it. 
 Then we have Jake, Sam, and they are with Andy and Felix. 
 Andy : Brains and brawn. Excellent choice, sir. 
 (Thunder cracks) How about some music to cheer us up?

♪ Elements that we all share... ♪ 
 Jake : You used gothed-up magic to transport us here...? 
 Sam : And you didn't even tell us. Unbelievable! 
 I knew it. You're a true witch. 
 I cast a spell to make Oscar walk again. 
 I didn't think it would actually work. 
 But you lied to us, all this time! 
 Because of you, we ate garbage, we slept in sheds and our mothers almost died! 
 And there's a demon trying to kill us! 
 We're your so-called friends! 
 We risked our lives for you! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Is that all you can say?! 
 Just let him cool off. 
 What spell did you cast? 
 An unmaking spell to undo Oscar's accident. 
 I didn't know that it would unmake all of us as well. 
 Well, shouldn't you have thought of that before? 
 At least this explains why the demon targets you. 
 You're the magical disturbance, but why us? 
 Of all the kids at school, why did you choose Jake, Sam, and me? 
 Because you have potential. 
 I knew it! See? I have potential! 
 Potential for what? 
 Magic. 
 Awesome! This is not an indication of forgiveness, by the way. 
 No way. 
 Hi! 
 Hi. 
 Hey, good to see you. 
 Yeah, you too. 
 Don't go there, remember? 
 Ellen's come to visit Andy, and I'm here as moral support. 
 I'm glad that you're a good friend and that I get to see you as well. 
 So, what now? 
 Now we know how we got here, we should be able to work out a way home. 
 I thought I could find the answer in Alice's Book of Shadows. 
 An unmaking spell? That's the spell Alice cast. 
 Yep, except her spell went even more wrong, so that's no help. 
 I'm beginning to understand why everyone hates you, Felix. 
 Thanks. 
 So, what can help us? 
 The talisman. 
 Except it's broken. 
 I think the talisman can do more than just protect us. 
 I think we can use it to get home. 
 Like I said, if it worked! 
 We have to reactivate the talisman by repeating the spell. 
 It needs the four of us. 
 Hi! Ellen! 
 Do you want to hang out with us? 
 There's this new pancake parlour - triple bacon and maple syrup. 
 Sorry, but I have a family thing. 
 There's other equally attractive and unhealthy menu items. 
 Seriously, I can't. Sorry. 
 I won't keep trying forever, you know? 
 I would much, much rather be having pancakes with you, but my family needs me! It's sort of a crisis. 
 You're too cute. Gets me every time. 
 Once we get this done, I'll come see you, I promise. 
 Sam, we need you inside. 
 Yeah, well, I'm out here, alright? 
 It's about getting home. 
 Look, I gotta go. 
 Remember how I said that I needed to be alone? 
 Yeah, look, I get it. I'm sorry. 
 I don't think I meant it. 
 Seriously? 
 We really need to go, Sam! 
 That was a waste of three hours of relationship counselling. 
 Ryan : They destroyed school property - I suspect not for the first time. 
 I'll call their guardian to bring them in. 
 I thought it was your job to uphold the law, Gary. 
 I thought it was yours to handle teenagers, Brian. 
 These boys have been trouble since they first showed up. 
 Isn't it time you did something about it, Sergeant? 
 This isn't the first complaint we've had, Sarge. 
 OK, we'll bring them in, then. 
 Right. 
 I'm the Water element, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're Earth. 
 Blow, airhead. 
 (Puffs) 
 I still hate you. 
 I know. 
 And Fire. 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee, Earth, Water, Air, Fire. 
 Within this stone, I invoke Ye place, Your greatest strength, your kindest grace, And while this stone remains at hand, Thou shall be safe throughout this land. 
 Is it working? 
 It used to glow when all of us are around. 
 Maybe it's broken for good. 
 A talisman is a vessel for magical energy. 
 You should be able to repair it, theoretically. 
 Something's missing. 
 OK, what's different between now and when you got it to work the first time? 
 Divinity of the Elements, I invoke Thee. 
 Bees? A bed? 
 Sam farted. (Laughs mockingly) 
 I don't think that's the answer. 
 Another Element. The Fifth Element! 
 Of course! 
 What's the Fifth Element? 
 According to Pagan Law, there are four worldly Elements - 
 Earth, Fire, Air, and Water - and then a fifth Element, Spirit. 
 It helps us connect to our higher power. 
 What's he doing here? 
 That doesn't matter right now! 
 So, what does he know? Do we have to kill him? 
 I know that you're aliens! 
 My brother. 
 What about him? 
 Oscar is the Fifth Element. 
 I thought the Elements had to come from our world. 
 Oscar is the reason the spell was cast. 
 He is the connection between our world and your world. 
 Righto, you boys need to come with me. 
 Phoebe : Why? 
 Roberts : Because we say so? 
 Oh, so, we live in a police state now! 
 Oh, come on, Phoebe. We've wanted to talk to these boys for a while. 
 They vandalised the auto workshop at school, amongst other things. 
 What are you doing here? I'll handle this, thanks, Bates. 
 Like you've handled everything else. 
 You can't just take us away from our legal guardian! 
 Watch me. Come on, let's go. 
 How about I send them to bed without any dinner. Will that do? 
 No, it won't do. Come on, boys, move it. 
 Yeah, alright, alright! 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go, move it. Come on. 
 I'm reporting you to Human Services. Dialling now. 
 Yeah, well, tell them what a useless guardian you are while you're at it. 
 I'll tell them the police are using unnecessary force on minors. 
 There are only three seatbelts in the back there, Constable. 
 I'll bring this one. 
 We'll squeeze him in. 
 Is that legal? 
 Not really, Sarge. 
 You bring him, if you think you can manage that small task. 
 Of course! Come on, Felix. 
 I'm happy to take him. It's on my way. 
 I can do it. 
 Let go! I said I'll do it! 
 Something's wrong. 
 What's happening? 
 What a psycho! 
 Mr Bates flipped out! 
 You've only just noticed? 
 What now? Demon Bates is mega scary. 
 Find Oscar and activate the talisman with his spirit. 
 Will it work without the others? 
 I don't know, but you don't have a choice. Go out... No, no, no! 
 What about you? 
 He's not after me! 
 I'm not gonna leave you alone! 
 I'm fine! Go, go! 
 Out of my way. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Arggh! 
 (Growls) 
 
 
 
 It is fork in the road time, boys. 
 It's not what you think. It's a matter of life and death. 
 Listen to me, either you sit up and take notice or you end up doing nothing with your life. Is that really what you want? 
 We're not from this world, Sergeant Riles! 
 Oh, not this again. 
 We're from a parallel universe exactly like this one, except here we don't exist. 
 I see you've attracted new members to your cult. 
 It's the truth. 
 You don't exist, right? 
 Yet we can see you sitting right in front of us. 
 But you don't know who we are. No-one does! 
 Tell me, then. Who are you? 
 What are you, nuts, mate?! 
 My name is Jake Riles. In our universe, I'm your son. 
 That's what he said when he first came in, Sarge. 
 You are unhinged, kid. 
 Your ex-girlfriend Sarah, she's my mum. 
 Enough. This is clearly a mental health issue. 
 In my world, you and Sarah had a kid when you were teenagers - me! 
 Call Child Services again. 
 Look at me, Dad! You know me. 
 I know you feel it! Just trust your feelings! 
 Magic brought us here. I know it sounds mental, but I've seen it. 
 Bates is possessed by a demon and he's trying to kill Felix. 
 Now, that's just silly! 
 Well, where's Phoebe and Felix? They're supposed to be here! 
 Bates was chasing them. I tried to tell you earlier, but you just made a joke. 
 Call Phoebe and ask her where she is. 
 Sure, Sarge. 
 And call Bates, and tell him to come here right now. 
 I want you to repeat these allegations to his face. 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 (Mobile phone beeps) 
 Bates : Hello? 
 No, I left them at the shop. 
 Yes, of course. 
 I'll be right there. 
 Sorry, Mr Bates. "You're welcome, Oscar!" 
 We're not discussing this anymore. 
 Close-minded like closed book. 
 I've heard that before, Lily, about a thousand times. 
 What are you doing? 
 I need you. 
 I'm on my way to work. My parents make me earn my Walterian mothership. 
 Forget that. You have to help me with a spell. 
 Me? 
 Yes, you. 
 Can you see Bates? 
 With a bit of subtlety...? 
 Oh, it's too late. He's coming this way. 
 Run! Run! 
 Oh, Mr Bates, how are you? 
 Hiya! Ghost! 
 You can do magic! 
 Since when? 
 Because you and I are related! 
 I knew it! I'm an alien too! So cool! 
 Not so cool and not so loud! 
 Why didn't you tell me earlier? 
 It wasn't quite as urgent as it is right now. 
 Urgent? 
 Yes. We're under attack. 
 Bates is possessed by a demon. 
 And he's right behind you. 
 That way! 
 I wanna stay with you. 
 No, he's after me! You go that way. Run, Oscar! 
 Here, Bates, you freak! 
 (Growls) 
 (Glass shatters) 
 (Metal clangs) 
 Arggh! 
 Nothing from Phoebe, but Bates says he's on his way. 
 For the record, I'm not buying your magic story for one second. 
 It's the truth! 
 We're seriously running out of time, Dad. 
 Report just in, Sarge. 
 Bates was seen chasing two teenagers north along Rowe Street. 
 It's Felix! 
 Who's the other kid? 
 Oscar? 
 The Fifth Element. 
 Let's go. 
 Take us with you! 
 Sorry, mate, this is a police matter. 
 It's just across the road, Dad, and we're just gonna follow you anyway. 
 Stop calling me 'Dad'. 
 I will if you let us come. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Stay out of sight and don't do anything. 
 What are you doing? I told you to run! 
 You said you needed my help! 
 Yes, but not now! 
 You're sending me mixed messages. 
 Demon chase. So cool! 
 Not cool, Oscar - lethal! This is not a game! 
 Gotta find the others! 
 Police station. Bates can't kill us there. 
 Kill us?! 
 Yes,  kill us! 
 They've gone. Come on. 
 Let's get back to Phoebe's. 
 Arggh! 
 Felix! Get off me! Let me go! 
 Don't hurt him! 
 You know the price. Come with me, Felix. 
 Let him go first. 
 Run! 
 (Growls) 
 Are you sure it was Brian Bates, the schoolteacher? 
 Yeah, the science teacher. 
 Chasing two boys! 
 See? 
 Ignore him. 
 Which way did they go? 
 That way. 
 We'll be faster if we drive. 
 Let's go, team! 
 This is where we part company. 
 I thought we were a team! 
 This is not a team! We're police officers. We're a team. 
 You're just... Very strange boys. 
 Good luck, then, Dad. 
 Thanks, Son. I mean, Jake! 
 You head back to the police station... 
 Where to now? 
 Phoebe's, yeah? 
 Did we lose him? 
 I think so. 
 What's happening? 
 I need your spirit to make this talisman work. 
 But why me? 
 Because in another world, you're my brother. 
 Whoa! 
 I've always wanted a brother. 
 Hold this. 
 OK. Close your eyes. 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee, Earth, Water, Air, Fire. 
 Within this store I invoke Ye place... (Car horn honks) 
 Your greatest strength, your kindest grace, And while this stone remains at hand, Thou shall be safe throughout this land. 
 He's back! Run! 
 Curious? 
 Very. 
 Leave him! Just take me. 
 I'll take you both. 
 Arggh! 
 No! Oscar! 
 Both : Order must be restored. 
 Arggh! Get off! 
 What happened? 
 We had a visit from a demon, what else? 
 That's pretty much what we figured. 
 Are you alright? 
 I think so. What's happened to Felix? 
 Bates is chasing him and Oscar. 
 My dad's after them, though. 
 Well, he doesn't stand a chance. 
 Bates picked me up and threw me like a ragdoll. 
 We've gotta find them. 
 Right. Let's go. 
 And then what? 
 Strong language? 
 Mediation? 
 Brute force is the only way to deal with a demon. 
 Honestly, what planet are you boys from? 
 Good question. 
 It was rhetorical. 
 Whatever. We need to defeat him. 
 Somehow. 
 There's only one way, isn't there? 
 Yes. 
 Magic. 
 Hey! 
 Felix : Help! Help me! 
 That's my freak of a next-door neighbour! 
 You're crossing professional boundaries, Mr Bates! 
 We're reporting you! 
 Here we go again, saving Felix from the demon. 
 Hey, Felix used magic to help his brother. You'd do the same. 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 And the boy has skill. 
 And we have potential. Does that make us warlocks as well? 
 It just seems to make you a pain. 
 The craziest thing happened! 
 We thought we'd better tell you. 
 Felix just got kidnapped by a teacher. 
 Mr Bates, right? 
 How did you know? 
 And Ellen's next-door neighbour. 
 Oscar was helping Bates? 
 They were carrying Felix together. 
 The demon's learned to possess more than one body. 
 OK, now I'm really scared. 
 Demon? As in the football team? 
 No, as in evil supernatural force. 
 We need to go to the police. 
 Hold on one sec, did you just say 'evil supernatural force'? 
 It's probably confession time, guys. 
 It all started with the school excursion. 
 Felix : Help! Help! Oh! Help! 
 Oscar : Quiet, flesh! 
 (Rock music blares on radio) 
 Let me out! Let me out of here! 
 (Siren wails) Let me out! Oscar! 
 Look at me! Oscar! 
 Pursuit? 
 Pursuit. 
 Let me out!
