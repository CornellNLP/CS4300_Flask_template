 Whoa! 
 We're lost! 
 Not everything out here is easily explained. 
 Andy! 
 Argh! 
 We need to get Andy back before anyone realises he's gone. 
 If we had Alice's Book Of Shadows... 
 I threw out all that rubbish. 
 Why would we trust you? 
 I want to help. 
 With a spell that conjures the missing element. 
 Element of water - find your power, take your form. 
 Whoa! 
 That's not Andy. 
 How do you know? 
 That's how! 
 Alice set us up. 
 She wanted us to unleash that water demon. 
 Is this what you want? 
 (Roars) 
 What are you guys doing in here? 
 We can explain. 
 (Screams) 
 Policeman : So his friends were here. 
 What's the bet he's just out being a standard-issue teenager? 
 Not my son. 
 I just wish we could've brought Andy back. 
 Where's Andy? 
 What exactly is going on? 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 3 
 Woman : Sam told you everything he knows. 
 Why do you need to interview Jake? 
 You don't seriously think they've done something with Andy. 
 It's out of my hands. 
 Do you know what they've been through these past few weeks? 
 It's a missing person's... 
 So what do we do? 
 We stick to our story, like we agreed. 
 We need to get back to rescuing Andy before things get... 
 Any weirder. 
 No, I'll brief the Chief Super myself as soon as I've spoken to these boys. 
 I will. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Is that...? 
 Forest Roland? 
 No beard, a suit - he's not Hermit Guy in this universe. 
 It might not be so bad. He was on our side. 
 Yeah, until he tried to destroy us. 
 Good point. 
 Roland : And then he runs into the bush? 
 Yes. 
 And this is after you argued? 
 I wouldn't call it an argument. 
 What would you call it? 
 A misunderstanding. 
 What would you call it? 
 A misunderstanding. 
 About what? 
 They liked the same girl. 
 ...Which is weird, 'cause I don't see why she's so likable. 
 And they fought over her? 
 It was more like a misunderstanding. 
 Yeah, what a surprise. 
 So there's a dispute over a girl, er... Ellen. 
 I guess. 
 Andy runs off, then what? 
 We searched everywhere. 
 From the bush along the river... 
 ...all the way to the national park. 
 Yeah, so long story short, Andy vanishes into what? 
 Thin air? 
 I honestly don't know where Andy went. 
 Whose idea was the home invasion? 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, it's not like we broke in. We used the spare key. 
 I'm sorry, so you were trespassing because...? 
 And at what point during the ransacking of Andy's room did you realise that he wasn't there? 
 Well, I... 
 I don't... 
 Yes, we haven't rehearsed this part of the story, have we? 
 We just wanted to find him. 
 Er, we thought it might help us figure out where Andy went. 
 Did you take something? Did you put something back? 
 It's not like that! 
 What is it like, Felix? 
 We didn't do anything to Andy! 
 If you've asked all your questions... 
 No, actually there's a few more. 
 I should take him back to school. 
 Mrs Ferne! 
 Your son argued with Andy Lau just before Felix here, and his friends, chased him into the bush. 
 Andy hasn't been seen since. 
 What do you expect us to think? 
 Let's go. 
 (Speaks indistinctly) I'm absolutely fuming! 
 What do we do, get lawyers? 
 It won't come to that, surely. 
 How full on was that? 
 This Roland is no fun at all. 
 Why is this Roland so different? 
 We get grilled by a detective that thinks we did something to Andy and that's what you guys are worried about that?! 
 This Roland should be the same as the one in the forest! 
 Maybe it's a chicken thing! 
 The Henriettas, remember? Raising chickens is supposed to be very calming. 
 This Roland could use some calming. 
 We're the only thing that's supposed to be different in these two universes. 
 Doesn't add up. 
 What does this have to do with Andy? We need to get the police off our backs! 
 We get Andy back. 
 You say that like it's actually possible. 
 Alice. She tricked us into making that water demon. 
 She knows what happened to him. 
 Boys! Why did the police want to speak to you? 
 Who does she think she is? 
 Did you do something to Andy Lau? 
 They haven't done anything. 
 And they've got nothing to say. 
 What's the connection between Andy vanishing and you all getting lost? 
 Why don't you get lost? 
 This latest disappearance comes just days after the Bremin Four emerged mysteriously unscathed after being lost in a nearby forest. 
 Police are refusing to comment on any link between the two events, but the remaining boys are now thought to be suspects in Andy Lau's disappearance. 
 Have you got anything to hide? 
 This is harassment! 
 Don't say anything. 
 Earlier today, the Lau family made an emotional plea. 
 If you have any information, please contact the police. 
 We just want our son back. (Sighs) Think like Phoebe... That's a start! What's going on? Nothing. I just had the TV on. That poor kid, I really feel for his family. Who'd wanna go through that? You know, I might be able to help... if I had my book. Aren't you the good Samaritan! You're right, we should stay out of it. I'm sure that kid will turn up. Did you get the registration papers? Can't get the van on the road without them. Not so fast. Happy? I need to know you're OK. It's been a big few weeks. I should catch up with the guys. I'm worried! I've barely heard a peep out of you. It's not my Sam. I don't get it : first, I talk too much, and now I don't blab not enough; I can't win. If you're not comfortable talking to me... All I need is a bit of 'normal'. Promise. I could organise a time with the school counsellor, if it would help. Mr North? No. Honestly, I'm good. What are you ashamed of, sweetheart? Nobody'd even have to know. I said I'm fine! I have to go. Now, straight home from school. No dilly-dallying. Dilly-dallying? What does that even mean? You too, Jake. We're gonna have a nice chat about boundaries and other people's houses. Yeah, well, we're really late, so... Boys! First day back. Looking forward to getting stuck in? Yeah. So much... How did it go with the police, OK? I'm glad it's over. I'll bet. It must be a relief. So unnecessary. OK. Bye, Mum. See you, love. Mrs ferne : You're telling me! I feel your pain. Mention it again and you'll feel my fist. (Laughs) He is really taking it well. We need to get to Alice's without being seen. Easy, everyone's in class. (School bell rings) Oh. Oi, what'd you do to the nerd? Boy : I'm innocent, Your Honour! Which one of your loser friends is next? So much for a low-key departure. Who thought celebrity would be such a drag? We can't leave now. Everyone's watching us. We could go to class. I could finish that English assignment with Mia, like I said I would. We don't have time for class! Dude! You're making it so hard for me to make things up to her. She didn't even return my calls last night. Wow... Your life must be so hard. I might cry for you. Where's your girlfriend? Oh, that's right : you don't have one. Come on. Ah... Mr North... Sam Conte, it is your lucky day. Is it? Is it really? I can fit you in this afternoon. Sorry? Your mum reached out. My office, lesson five. What a nightmare. He's gonna want me to talk about my feelings. And I don't wanna talk about my feelings. I don't even want to have feelings! Don't tell him anything. No-one's looking. Can we just go? There she is. Where is he? Hi. What are you doing here? Where's Andy? He's not home? No, funny about that. What's going on? That's what we wanna know. Didn't you try the spell? You set us up! What are you talking about? The spell you gave us summoned a water demon. It... What?! You must not have done it right. Well, show me your book then. Show me the spell. I don't have it. I can't do any magic without it. Which means... Phoebe : What's going on? Are you alright? Your sister sabotaged our spell to bring Andy home. Felix, maybe you got it wrong. It wouldn't be the first time. It wasn't my fault! You have to tell us where Andy is! She doesn't have to do anything, creepy! My sister doesn't do magic anymore, so we can't help you. Goodbye. You know something. OK, not loving this attitude. You're lying! I just want the truth. Why won't you tell me? Argh, his hands are boiling hot! Whoa, dude! How are you doing that? Felix, get a grip! I'm trying! Dude! I don't understand. I'm sorry. Sorry. It's out. It's OK. Get him out of here. Pronto! Felix. That was bad, Felix. Someone could have got hurt. You think I don't know that? It's not like I meant for it to happen. Any chance of Phoebe and Alice helping us has just gone up in smoke. It could happen to any of us! The earthquake, anyone? Alice IS responsible for what happened to Andy. She has to be. Maybe another spell went wrong. Maybe that's got nothing to do with Alice. Yeah, she doesn't scream evil supervillain to me. It was her! I didn't do anything wrong. Dude! That Water Andy was all kinds of wrong! It was her magic! Her incredibly powerful magic. If we had her Book Of Shadows... She said she doesn't have it. She wants it, though. I could see that. You think Phoebe threw it out, with all the other magic shop stuff? Great, so it could be anywhere. There are hundreds of spells in it. Serious magic. It's our only chance. But where would we even start to look? Maybe Oscar's power can help. Now, don't be nervous. We're talking to everyone that knows Andy. I'm not nervous. Did Felix ever argue with his brother? Not really. How did Oscar's accident happen? They were climbing a tree. Oscar fell. Felix was up the tree with him, but he didn't fall. No. I see. What are you saying? Because Felix didn't do anything to Oscar or Andy. They spent half of yesterday looking for him. You know that for a fact? What else would they have been doing? You tell me. Ellen, if you know something, you should say so. Ellen... There was a 'thing'. A thing...? They had this 'thing' they had to do. They wouldn't say what. 
 
 (Phone rings) Murphy. Ellen, you seen Oscar? Not since before lunch. Did you hear? They found Andy in Rochford. What? Someone phoned in a sighting. Is that possible? Let's hope so. We should get to class. Felix, I need to talk to you. Later, OK? Again with the 'later'? I'm sorry, I can explain. Can you? Like, right now? Not right now. Didn't think so. Do you really think they found Andy in Rochford? Not a chance. Well, if somebody saw him... A magic storm sucks Andy up into the sky and deposits him into a lame tourist town? I don't think so. The skip, outside the magic shop. What, you think Andy's there? If Phoebe threw Alice's book out, that's where it would be. Can it be that easy? I was starting to think you were a no-show. Mr North. Not a word. Come on. Well, there's no chance of getting this thing to flower. They're just kids. Kids with freaky, uncontrollable powers. How did Felix do that? In all those years studying magic... It's not magic... It's something else. How do you know? I don't... not for sure. Maybe I could find out if I had my Book... Book Of Shadows? No way. You took it. We're better off without it. That's where you were when I got back, isn't it? With you and magic, it's all or nothing! And you're making sure it's nothing. I could keep us safe! I could do lots of things. That's the problem. You had no right to take it! You're not getting it back, Alice! Now, first thing to know - this is a safe place. Second thing... Look. Only people with problems need counselling... Second thing to know - getting started is the hardest part. ...And I don't have problems, so... Then why is your mum so worried about you? I don't know, you'd have to ask her. Huh, I'm asking you. Well, she worries too much. Because...? Because of what you've been through? Getting lost...? Andy going missing...? A police investigation...? What do you think, Sam? The best way of dealing with the tough stuff is to talk about it. It was right here! This is not happening. No bins, no Book of Shadows. I'm not getting anything. Maybe if we got close to Alice and I made a connection, I could sense where her book is. Like a magical sniffer dog? Yeah, sort of. We don't know if that's how it works. It could help, though. Alice is dangerous, you have to stay away from her. Promise me! Fine, I will. You should go back to school. I can help. You've done heaps already, Oskie. There's no point you getting in trouble as well. Sure, let me know if you find anything. Any ideas? None. You've gotta be kidding me. (Sighs) Mia, hey. I've been looking for you. Here I am. I just wanted to say that I wasn't myself at the party. Really? Secretive, jealous, unavailable... That's just the new you, is it? Give me another chance? I... No, you're right. I was all of those things, and you're not. You're kind, you're sweet, and you believe the best in people. I promise that when we find Andy... I thought the police found him? Um, yeah, well... They haven't? Um... (Phone rings) Felix, what's up? OK. Sorry. It's fine, really. I have to go. Go. So here we are... Two girls who don't believe in chasing after guys... Watching the guys run off. I don't think they think Andy's in Rochford. Really? The boys know something. If they're not telling us something, we'll just have to find out for ourselves. I want every available Rochford car on the street to be looking out for an Andy Lau, and find who's called this in. ...Join the thin blue line. What are you doing? The kids asked me to do a talk for Careers Day. Did they? Yeah, they really admire the police force. They wanna hear all about enforcing road rules... ...And parking violations. They're pulling my leg, aren't they? Seems like a distinct possibility. Pull these boys out of class. Let's see how they react to this news. That might be tricky. Why? Well, they're not in class. The teacher said they never showed up. And you didn't think to mention this earlier? There was... You know what, Rochford can wait. Come on. Bins? Again? Really? At least we're not looking for food this time. How was Mr North? He wants me to release my emotions using hydrotherapy. Oh, wait. No. What's the one where 'you're getting sleepy'...? Hypnotherapy? Bingo. Sounds awesome, right? Your subconscious spilling the beans is not awesome, Sam. So, what, we just dive in? Unless you've got a better idea. This rescuing Andy stuff just keeps getting better and better. (Groans) It stinks in here. (Boys speak indistinctly) Roland : I knew sticking around here was the right thing to do. Policeman : Why'd they come here? They're not dumping anything. Maybe they're shifting something. Something they didn't hide well enough last time they were here. Randomly touching other people's houses. Some people might think that's a bit odd. I was just... You're Felix's brother, aren't you? Look, I should leave. That's OK, you can... What was that? I've gotta go. What's to bet that it's right at the bottom where all the bin juice is? Guys, guys, what we really need is an extra pair of hands. Just keep looking. Ever thought of doing comedy? You are really funny. Elements, reveal and show what I seek, what I must know. Oh, no... My book! (Phone rings) And the trace confirms that the call originated in Bremin? Sergeant... Yeah. Wait. So no sign of Andy at all? Something's happening. Shh. This call was a hoax. Thank you. Right, come on. I gotta get to the station. What are you doing? New lead. We gotta go, we gotta go! What's going on? Oscar knows where Alice's book is and Alice does too. Come on! Are you sure you know where this is? Trust me, it's this way. We have to find this lake. You do the magic and we'll do the orienteering. We're close! We need to move faster, come on. Oh, wait up! There it is. Awesome! I told you. We need to find this tree. Look for freshly-dug soil underneath. Over here. Alice beat us to it. Now, this is bad. Really, really bad. Any chance of us getting Andy back disappeared with that book. If we had a real water element, we could do a tracking spell. There's another water element? Possibly. You weren't the only ones with potential. We know it was you, Felix. We traced the call from the exchange to here. Long story short, I'll find out exactly what happened to Andy. Viv : I found them in Andy's internet history. This could form a major part of the police investigation. No, we're not dobbing them into the cops. The police might be able to help. When I was lost, in the forest, I thought about you. So, um, are you new? Either you tell me now, or I don't think we can be together anymore. Can you make a spell that makes me immune to hypnotism? One. Can you remember the forest? Yes. Good.
