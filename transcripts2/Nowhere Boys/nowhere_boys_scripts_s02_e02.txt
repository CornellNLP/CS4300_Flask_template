 This is amazing, Oskie. 
 I love it. 
 Alice is here, Phoebe's missing sister, the restoring demon. 
 Alice...? 
 What is that? 
 It's not glowing. 
 There's no danger? 
 I don't understand it. 
 In this universe, she's not into you. 
 If only she could see what I can do. 
 Are you crazy? What are you doing? Everyone could have seen that. 
 Hey, Andy, give it back! 
 You can control everything. 
 Who said that? 
 Say the spell! 
 Andy, stop! 
 I have the power now. 
 Andy! 
 All : Andy! 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 2 
 Andy, no! 
 Andy! Andy! 
 Andy! Andy? 
 Andy? Come back! 
 I did not see what I just saw. 
 What was that spell? 
 And what was he doing with it? 
 Andy, can you hear me? 
 He got sucked into the sky, doofus! 
 How could this happen? 
 Looks like Andy was using magic he didn't understand and couldn't control. 
 Yeah,  your  magic, from  your  Book of Shadows - so reliable. 
 That wasn't my spell! I don't know where he got it. 
 It doesn't look like one of these either. 
 So where is he now? 
 He could be anywhere or... 
 Nowhere. 
 I don't know. 
 Felix, you always know. 
 There's always a plan. 
 Give me a second. 
 No, we need to get Andy back before anyone realises he's gone. 
 His parents, the reporters... 
 All will freak if he's missing again. 
 I know. 
 OK. What about an unmaking spell? 
 Unmaking spells are too hard to control, but... 
 But what? 
 Maybe something like it. Maybe a reversal spell. 
 We'll need something to sacrifice. 
 Like... a human sacrifice? Dude! 
 No, something Andy really cares about. 
 Chicken feet! 
 What? They don't taste as bad as you think. 
 Like we did with the spell that cured our mums. 
 Exactly. 
 OK. You guys find something Andy would never give up. 
 I'll try and figure out what his spell was. 
 Let's go. 
 Hi! Where are you going? You're not well. 
 Is the main street as dull as it used to be? 
 You're supposed to be resting. 
 Oh, Phoebe, stop worrying. 
 We could do some shopping. 
 We're just going to pretend the last ten years didn't happen? 
 (Sighs) 
 I know it was hard on you. 
 'Hard' doesn't come close. 
 The way you disappeared in that forest without a trace... 
 You don't know what that was for me. 
 It's not gonna happen again. 
 You bet it isn't. 
 That's why we're putting magic behind us. 
 I'm back. 
 I want to move forward, make a fresh start. 
 Please... 
 For me? 
 Look at you - suddenly all sunshine and fresh starts. 
 Come on. 
 I think Felix is acting weird. 
 Define 'weird.' 
 OK - more weird. 
 He's been back, what, a day? 
 Ellen, hi. Fun party, huh? 
 Yeah, so much fun. 
 OK. I just wanted to ask if maybe... 
 Since when do I have 'approachable' stamped on my forehead? 
 Have you seen Sam, yes or no? 
 I'd know where your boyfriend is because...? 
 Because my boyfriend seems to have a man crush on  your  boyfriend. 
 Felix is not my  boyfriend . 
 Whatever. Forget it. 
 We're just seeing a movie because I... 
 He's not my boyfriend. 
 Right. 
 Keep out of sight. 
 Dude, the party sounds awesome. 
 Seriously? We've got to get to Andy's, remember? 
 I'm just saying. (Mobile rings) 
 Hey! 
 I'm on it. 
 Sam? 
 Hey, babe. 
 Why are you whispering? 
 No reason. 
 Look, I think it's sweet that you're jealous. 
 Jealous?! 
 I'm not jealous! 
 So you see me talking to another guy, then you disappear, and the two things aren't connected at all? 
 No! 
 I'm... 
 Hurry up, dude! 
 Look, I know talking about our relationship isn't your idea of fun, but... 
 It's so fun! I totally think it's fun. I'll be back soon. 
 I promise, we'll talk. 
 Sam! 
 I've got to go. Bye. 
 Sam! Come on. 
 Andy, where are you...? 
 Come back, come back, come back. 
 Come on, Andy. What have you done? 
 Locked. Doesn't look like anyone's home. 
 When a girl wants to talk about your re- lationship, it's never a good thing, right? 
 Focus. 
 Dude! She's gonna break up with me and there's nothing I can do about it! 
 Probably. 
 Seriously? You're not helping. 
 Priorities, Sam. We need to get inside, remember? 
 I know. You're right. You're right! 
 Any ideas? 
 I'll superpower it open. 
 Really? 
 I've totally got this. 
 Summer breeze. Impressive. 
 Oh, you can do better? 
 By getting the door open? Yeah, pretty much. 
 You're all doubty now, but once I get the hang of this superpower stuff, stand by for all kinds of awesomeness. 
 Dude, seriously? 
 It's not that kind of rock. 
 Key hider. 
 These aren't the right words. Where did you get that random spell? 
 How could someone so smart be so dumb? 
 Who's so smart? 
 Mia. 
 Hey. I was just... 
 Talking to yourself? 
 That seem crazy? It does, doesn't it? 
 A little bit. 
 What are you doing out here? 
 Parties aren't really my thing. 
 Was Sam with you? 
 Nope. 
 We just had a weird phone conversation. 
 Haven't seen him. So... 
 Did something happen when you guys were away? 
 Like what? 
 I don't know... 
 He just seems different. 
 It was intense. Still is, sort of. 
 That's what I wanted to talk to him about, that, and what's going on between us. 
 Overshare. Sorry. 
 If I see him, I'll tell him you're looking for him. 
 Thanks, Felix. 
 Straight to voicemail, but I'm sure he'll be back soon. 
 I get why he bailed on the party, but he usually bails with me. 
 I guess he's just bonded with those guys while they were missing. 
 One minute, he's asking me out, next minute, he's nowhere. 
 Boys don't make sense. 
 It's probably best not to think about it too much. 
 You think I'm overthinking it? 
 I, um... 
 You're right. 
 Better to just ask him straight out. 
 Capital of Nerdtown. 
 Mm! 
 Bear Grylls? 
 Or this? That's Olympiad. 
 Come on, Andy. What do you really care about? 
 Look. 
 Dude - 'You plus me equals love.' 
 The other Ellen gave it to Andy. 
 That's so lame! 
 
 
 
 What are you guys doing in here? 
 Viv, right? 
 Did you change your hair? Looking good. 
 I'll scream. 
 Look, we can explain. 
 (Screams) Or we could just go. 
 Stop them! 
 Hey, what you doing here? 
 (Screams) Come back! 
 What you doing in my house? Stop! 
 Hey! 
 I'm calling Mum. 
 Stupid boys. Cracked my face. 
 Hey. Before, I might have been a bit... 
 Rude, nasty? 
 I was in a bad mood. 
 You've been in a bad mood since kindergarten. 
 Hush! 
 Look, We don't have to be friends just 'cause the boys are. 
 Obviously. 
 Didn't find Sam? 
 No. I saw Felix, though. 
 Where? 
 Ten minutes that way, near some trees. 
 Could you be a little more specific? 
 I don't know. There were trees around, lots of them. 
 Do you think you could show me? 
 I didn't think you would chase after a guy. 
 I'm so not that kind of girl. 
 Neither am I. 
 Did you get something? 
 No sign of Andy? 
 Nothing. 
 How about this? 
 'You plus me equals love.' 
 It so doesn't add up. 
 Andy brought it all the way home from the other universe. 
 He's really into Ellen, isn't he? 
 Way to rub it in! 
 Rub what in? 
 Oh! 
 Do you think it will work? 
 I hope so. 
 Dude! You could've mentioned something about the tearing-up part. Andy's gonna freak! 
 Elements that speak as one, recant their voice, their will undone. 
 Elements that speak as one, recant their voice, their will undone. 
 You sure you're saying it right? 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Bowm, bowm! 
 And Plan B is...? 
 Phoebe? She knows more about magic than any of us. 
 What, we go back again? 
 She doesn't want anything to do with us, remember? 
 So we change her mind. 
 And hope Alice hasn't got to her. 
 There she is! 
 Phoebe! 
 Go away. 
 Andy cast a spell that went wrong. 
 Got turned into a water-something and got sucked up into a vortex. 
 I tried to reverse it, but... 
 What part of 'go away' are you not getting, the 'go' or the 'away'? 
 If we had Alice's Book of Shadows... 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You had it in your magic shop. 
 I threw out all that rubbish. 
 So what do we do now? 
 Panic? 
 I know why your spell didn't work. 
 Stay away from us. 
 You're missing a Water element, aren't you? 
 Whoa, how did you know? 
 What are you talking about? 
 If you cast it again with Andy's elemental presence... 
 His what now? 
 Why would we trust you? 
 You tried to destroy us. 
 (Sighs) You think I'm something I'm not, Felix. 
 I'm not a threat. 
 Yeah? Well, why take the risk? 
 Felix, if she can find Andy... 
 Look, I know how hard it was on Phoebe, with me being away. I want to help. 
 Felix... Listen to her. 
 What choice do we have? 
 OK. Where do we start? 
 With a spell that conjures the missing element. 
 I found them in Andy's room, and then they took off. 
 Jake Riles and the Conte boy? 
 What did they take? 
 Nothing that we know of. 
 Mm. Almonds, eh? 
 You don't seem to be taking this very seriously. 
 So his friends were here, but they didn't take anything, and Andy's not so much missing as at a party? 
 I've rung and rung. He always calls back. 
 I warned him - bad spirits. 
 Nainai, stop. 
 Something's not right. 
 What's the bet he's just out being a standard-issue teenager? 
 Not my son. He's not like that. 
 He's been different since he got back. 
 Alright. Why don't I go down there and put your mind at ease? 
 I'm coming too. 
 Vivian, I don't think... 
 I'm going. 
 Thanks for the biscuit. 
 I just take these. 
 She couldn't take her eyes off the talisman. 
 Face it, Felix, the Alice in this universe isn't a demon. 
 Something's not right, I don't know if we should trust her. 
 'Cause we have so many other options. 
 What about this conjuring-an-element stuff? How does that even work? 
 The Andy pond! That's what we use to stand in for Andy. 
 A pond? 
 A magic pond. 
 Full of Andy elementalness? 
 This is so not how I thought coming home would be. 
 Tell me about it. 
 What did you expect, your own reality show? 
 Would that be so bad? 
 Or at least a little time in the spotlight at our own party. 
 That Lachlan guy is such a poser. 
 Hey, I'll catch up with you, guys. I must have dropped my phone back there. 
 Sam, you can't. There's no time. 
 We have to rescue Andy. 
 I know. I know! You're right. 
 Felix? 
 Ellen. Hey. 
 Look, I didn't ask you to ask me to the movies. 
 I know. 
 So if this is your way of backing out of it, then... 
 No. It's not. Absolutely not. 
 Felix, we need to keep moving. 
 Moving where? 
 We've got this thing. 
 Thing? What thing? 
 Felix...? 
 It's complicated. Talk later? 
 I guess. 
 I really have become one of those girls. 
 Think Ellen suspects something? 
 She probably suspects you're a weirdo. 
 Nah, she'd definitely know by now. 
 Can we just do this? 
 Thank you. 
 You know, in a world of out-there plans, this is  the out-therest . 
 It's elemental and it's Andy. 
 Element of water, find your power, take your form. 
 Keep going. 
 Flow again. Release. Re-form. 
 Look! It's working. 
 Element of Water, find your power, take your form. 
 Flow again. Release. Re-form. 
 Whoa! 
 All : Andy! 
 Yes! 
 Andy, are you OK? 
 Tell me what to do. 
 I need the talisman. 
 I need it. 
 What does 'you plus me equal'? 
 Felix, what are you doing? 
 Andy would know. 
 Talisman! 
 It's not Andy. 
 How do you know? 
 That's how. 
 Run! 
 Faster, Felix! 
 Come on! 
 (Roars) 
 So I'm guessing there's something wrong with the spell. 
 You think? What gave it away? 
 We did what alice said: call the elemental force to find its power. 
 Alice set us up. 
 She wanted us to unleash that... 
 Water demon...? 
 Whatever it is, it's pretty keen on getting the talisman. 
 If we lose that talisman, there's no way of getting Andy home. 
 The spell. I casted one to unleashed it, maybe I can undo it. 
 What do you mean 'maybe'? If it puts that thing back in its box, go for it. 
 I just need to figure out something to sacrifice. 
 Oscar's comic. 
 In the meantime, anyone got any ideas on how we outrun this thing? 
 We split up. It can't follow all three of us. 
 And the one it does follow? 
 Oi! 
 Run! 
 Elements, reveal and show what I seek, what I must know. 
 I think we lost him. 
 This is not good. 
 Really not good. 
 Give it to me. 
 Back off. 
 (Laughs) 
 That's it? 
 Well, feel free to outdo me! 
 Give me the talisman. 
 Felix, give it to me. 
 Why? 
 Just give it to me! 
 Go low! 
 Huh? 
 What are you doing? 
 Even Water Andy is bad at sport! Is this what you want, huh? 
 Any time you want to do something, Felix! 
 Over here! Catch! 
 Don't let him get it. 
 Throw it! 
 Ready? 
 Don't let him catch it. 
 Elements that speak as one, recant their voice, their will undone. 
 This better work. 
 Elements that speak as one, recant their voice, their will undone. 
 Oscar's comic? You sure? 
 It only works if it means a lot. 
 Take that, water demon! 
 (Laughs) 
 You couldn't go a whole day without breaking a promise? 
 It's just a scrying pool. 
 It's, ah, hardly big-time magic. 
 It's more than I could ever do. 
 I was looking for my Book of Shadows, that's all. 
 Promise me you'll stop. No more magic. 
 Phoebe, you're overreacting. 
 Swear! 
 Fine! 
 Pinky swear. 
 Good. 
 Come with me. 
 Tell me what I'm looking at. 
 Fresh start. 
 This manky, old thing? 
 Or, with a bit of imagination, a hot, right-now Mexican cafe on wheels. 
 Why Mexican? 
 We have to tell people you were somewhere all this time, right? 
 We get this thing up and running, we can go anywhere we want - away from all the questions and the bad memories. 
 You, making actual food, being nice to people? 
 This, I have to see. 
 I'm sorry you had to give up Oscar's comic. 
 Will he be dark about it? 
 Not when he hears it was a game-changer. 
 Just wish we could have brought Andy back, the real one. 
 The day's not over yet. 
 Ah, what's... 
 Is that them? Let me through. 
 Where's Andy? Have you seen him? 
 You lot, what exactly is going on? 
 Did you do something to Andy Lau? 
 They haven't done anything! 
 And they've got nothing to say. 
 Is that Forest Roland? 
 He's not Hermit Guy in this universe. 
 Felix here and his friends chased him into the bush. 
 What do you expect us to think? 
 Alice is responsible for what happened to Andy. 
 If we had her Book Of Shadows... 
 She said she doesn't have it. 
 If we got close to Alice, we'd sense where her book is. 
 Alice is dangerous. You have to stay away from her. 
 Your sister sabotaged our spell. 
 I just want the truth. Why won't you tell me? 
 His hands are boiling hot! 
 Whoa! 
 How are you doing that? 
 Secretive, jealous, unavailable. That's the new you, is it? 
 Give me another chance? 
 Felix, I need to talk to you. 
 Later, OK? 
 Again with the 'later'? 
 The boys know something. 
 We'll just have to find out for ourselves.
