 Good morning, bushwalkers. Ready to leave your comfort zones? 
 I have preselected the groups, so don't expect to be with any of your friends. 
 She freaks me out, the witch lady. 
 If you want to win so much, there's a short cut. 
 Short cut to where? 
 He's slipping! 
 You lost the map? 
 Cooee! 
 This way! 
 Not everything out here is easily explained. 
 Where's the cameras and the newspapers? 
 Does our disappearances and miraculous reappearance seem a bit like a non-event to you? 
 Hi, Oskie. How did it go at the doctor's? 
 What's your problem? 
 You can stand! 
 How do you know my name? Who are you? 
 Season 1, Episode 2 
 Oh, Jakie. I couldn't keep my eyes open. 
 I made your favourite - bacon, lettuce and tomato. 
 Won't you be late? 
 Dad called, he's gonna drive me to the game. 
 Really. 
 I ironed a fresh uniform for you. 
 You are my rock. 
 Can't you give up just one of those shifts? 
 You look so wrecked. 
 Jake, I just want to get us out of this house, into a proper place, you know, something big. 
 Get us a car to hoon around in, hey? 
 I am so lucky to have you. 
 We're both lucky, Mum. 
 (Knocking on screen door) 
 Jake, son. Jeez, you look well. 
 Yeah, you too. 
 Hang on a sec, mate. Your mum home? 
 Um... yeah. 
 Sarah? 
 Oh, listen, I... 
 Is there any chance you might lend me 100 or so for the week? 
 You're kidding... 
 Dad, where's the car? 
 Ah... Yeah, mate. 
 Sorry. A bit of trouble on the home front. 
 Long story short, no car this week. 
 Got the trusty bike, though. 
 You were gonna drive me to the game, remember? 
 Every time. I'm such an idiot! 
 Don't give him a cent. 
 Jake, wait! I can dink you. 
 Come on, mate! Wait... 
 Mum...! 
 (Clattering) 
 Hello...? 
 Who's that? 
 (Phone rings) 
 Mum... 
 Hello? How are you, mate? 
 Yeah. (Video-game effects) Telly. Hey, Telly, you seen my mum? Who? My mum. How am I supposed to know your mum? Who are you? Come on. Quit playing games, mate. Who's in our house? What?! Whose stuff is that in there? You're crazy. Give it back! Lemme use it for a second. I need to call my mum. Give me my phone. Recording :  The number you have dialled is not connected. Give me my phone! Will you stop sooking? Do you know where she is or not? Give it back! Stop! I'll bring it back later. And tell my mum I'm looking for her. (Sports commentary on game) Woo! And the crowd goes crazy as he returns from the wild. Keep it down! Really? Is that all you have to say? I'm back. So we smell, man. Back from where? Yes! It was pretty much the worst night of my life. Man, I've never been so hungry. So where's Mum and Dad? Training, probably. Dude, you've got food! Where's mine? Get it yourself! Isn't Mum freaking out? About what? My disappearance. What? Come on. I just need to know if there were tears or not. Sammy, shut your hole! Hey, come on! Don't call me that. You know I hate that! What...? (Speaks indistinctly) Both : What?! I'll kill you, Sammy! Kill me? What for? You were just there. (Eerie voice) I don't want to order anything. I'm looking for Mum. What did you say her name was? Sarah. Jim, she works here. Sarah. I've never seen a Sarah. We've got a Sue. I don't reckon she's your mum, though. She 18. She's here every day. Kid, I don't know what you're on about. Unless you want to order something, on your bike. But she is missing. Back up. You just told me YOU went missing, in the bush. Yes. But now you're not, and instead your mum's gone. You sure she didn't just go out somewhere? Women do that, you know. None of our stuff is there. And she'd never disappear without letting me know. Why is this so hard to understand? I need to find my Mum. You're the cops. This is your thing. Okay. Calm down. Let's start with her name. I'll check to see if there's any admissions. Admissions where? Hospital or... Sarah Ryles. Sarah Ryles? Yes, that's her name. Any connection to Gary Ryles? Yeah, they were married. He's my dad. Don't move. Hey, boss? There's this crazy kid here claiming that Sarah Ryles is his mum. His missing mum, and that you're his dad. What? Hey, you think we should get in Child Services? He's kinda upset. Or I could just throw him in the lock-up. I'll talk to him. He was pretty convincing. Mm-hm. Jake! Jake, wait! Please! Am I glad I found you. What do you want? I'm busy. Is there a biomechanical advantage to such a small bike? This isn't a good time. Wait! Where are you going? To work out what the hell happened to my life while you freaks got me lost. What's happened? Just let me alone. Don't you have a home to go to? That's the problem. I'm not sure I do. I didn't notice anything when I first walked in. I thought I was gonna get into trouble for not coming home last night. Viv! What have you done to the inner sanctum? (Screams) What are you doing in my room?! YOUR room? I was only gone one night. What?! What are you wearing? Get out, you creep! Are you insane? (Yells indistinctly) Nai-Nai! Oh, my God! Get out, you pervert! Nai-Nai! (Screams) I didn't mean it! Some weird kid got us lost. Get out, thief! I beat you! They were totally delusional. That's nothing new for my sister, but my nonna? It makes no sense. I don't think they recognised me. At all. Yeah, it's a sad story, bro. Heartbreaking. What, so everything's normal for you? Look, I've just got to find my mum. Alright? Something's happened, hasn't it? While we were lost in the bush. Touch me again and something WILL happen. It's not just Andy. Something happened to me too. Mum, Dad! Hey, Dad. Can I help you? Dad...? You've got me confused, mate. Come on, this isn't funny. Why isn't anyone freaking out? Is Mum OK? What do you want, kid? Mum! Mum, are you OK? Look, that's enough, yeah? Just... Run along, would you? Dee! Are you alright? I lost my breath. It's kind of weird. Who's that boy? They had no idea who you were? None. What about you, Jake? Leave me out of this. You guys are cracked. Something's wrong, isn't it. Look, someone's living in my house. OK? And my mum's gone missing. So I don't need to listen to your nerd fantasies, I just need to find her. Jake! There's a 70, maybe 80% probability that when you do find her, she'll have no idea who you are. Yeah, cheers. Wait! We'll help you find her. OK, Andy. What do you think happened? My theory is, while we were lost in the bush, our families experienced mass delusional hysteria. That makes no sense whatsoever. Delusions can take extreme forms. There was an entire village in southern China where all the men thought their... ...Had shrivelled away to nothing. Oh, man! In our case, it's taking the form of collective amnesia. Everyone who knows us has forgotten us. What about Felix? If it's happened to him, that's at least proof that the four of us are somehow connected to this. Come on, Jake, you owe us that much. Alright. But where do we find him? Sleeping in a coffin somewhere? I know where he lives. Really...? What? We used to egg his house after a footie win. It's good luck. Come on. How's that theory holding up? He doesn't exactly look like he's having a bad day. 
 
 Hey, guys. You're home? Where else would I be? Everything... OK? Man, how good does it feel to be home after last night? Yeah, about that... Well, I hope you like this. It's one of Oscar's favourites. Friends of yours, Felix? Yeah, these are the guys that helped me back from the bush. Sounds like an adventure, boys. Can I get you anything else? No. The fairy bread is great. Oh, man, I'm starving. I haven't eaten since... You ate Roland's food in front of us? (Chuckles) That's right. Whoops. And I had a chicken. Here. We've only got this low-sugar stuff, so youse will have to drink three times as much. Thanks, Oscar. He's walking! He shouldn't be walking. I know, my brain REALLY hurts. Mum, did you make fairy bread? Yeah, you love it. Yeah, when I was six! More visitors. Some of your new friends, Oscar. You make me sound like a loser. I'll leave you both to play before I get into more trouble. I might have a lie-down. So great. Oscar, I'll be back in a sec, OK. Did you take your move? Yeah, just a pawn. What are you guys doing here? Why is your brother walking? I know. It's crazy, right? How is it possible? It's not. I know... Felix, will you stay for dinner? Yeah. Thanks. I'd like that. Well, that's... wonderful. "Stay for dinner"? Like you don't actually live here? Of course I live here. But your mum called you, a new friend. They don't know who you are, do they? Felix! I came home, and it was like this. Oscar can walk, but my family can't remember me. It's weird, but my brother can walk! Oscar is definitely an X factor in my theory. What theory? Collective amnesia. Our families were so traumatised by us going missing, that they had a short circuit. But your brother walking? It doesn't fit at all. None of this is helping me find my mum. So... I'm out of here. Jake! You know, I can't believe I let you brain-dead pack of losers into my head. Brain-dead? Seriously? Where are you going? What do you think? What I should have been doing all this time. Ellen! What is she wearing? Ellen! Do I know you? Oh, no. You too? Me too what? Sorry. My mistake. You look like a friend. Well, I'm not. You sound like her too. Figures this misfit would be one of your friends. I hate you too. Guys, I'm gonna... Maybe you should go. We should stick together. Why? Whatever's going on happened to all of us. Maybe it's because of us. When you can figure it out, you know where to find me. Hey, I'm really sorry. Mum's gone all sick and weird and... We've had our dinner after all. Really? One more game. No, I really should be doing my homework, but good meeting you. Guess I'll see you around, maybe. Yeah, I'll see you... ...Around. Guys! How can you just kick us out like that? We told you Dad owes us rent money. I don't have the first idea what you're talking about. Our house...? You can't just give it to someone else. What house? Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about, you bully! Hey, you got a complaint, you put it in writing. This isn't a complaint. I want my home back, and where did my mum go? Sharon! Sharon, call the cops, love. Tell me what happened to my mum? I have no idea who your mum is! This isn't over. I think it is! Bye, mate! Oh, sorry. (Sneezes) Mum...? Mum! Mum... Mum, it's me. Sorry? It's me. You were following me, weren't you? It's Jake, your son...? (Gasps) I don't have a son. Please, what do you want? Sarah, everything OK? What are YOU doing here? How can we help you, son? I wouldn't use that word. Mum, what's wrong? Please! I'm not your mum. Please. Are you two married? Sarah, what's going on? When did that happen? That's none of your business. Who are you, anyway? I'm... I'm... I'm no-one. Sorry. You OK? Yeah. Sorry, Telly. We have power and network but... Still nothing. If I just get my hands on a phone that works, I'll call... Who? Well, someone has to remember us. (Stomach rumbles) I don't think that fairy bread was enough. And it's only made me hungrier. Do you think we'll starve to death... In our own town? Like those stories you read in the papers... About old people who starve to death and get half-eaten by their pets. You just default to cheerful, don't you? There's an old apple tree out back of the footie stand if you're desperate. You alright? I'm sorry about before. Did she remember you? Yeah, welcome to the club. My mum's got a whole new life... New job, new car, new hair, and she's married to Bates. Mr Bates? What? Whoa! And Felix's brother can walk. It's not amnesia. So what's really going on? Dude, I'll tell you what's going on. What's going on is I'm starving. We need to find something to eat and somewhere to stay. I know this seems challenging, but... The one thing I've learned from watching Bear Grylls is that... No more, Andy. Shut up. Couldn't agree more. I know somewhere we can go. My brothers and I played ball games here when we were kids. It's open. It used to look a lot better. It has potential. Every gang needs a hideout. We are not a gang. Technically we are, if you consider... OK, not a gang. We can clear this space over here to eat... To eat. Has anybody else got their phones? Mine's out of juice. Same. I've got mine on power-save mode. Nice one. Ow! You know what'd make this even worse? What? If I wasn't here. Good one, Dracula. We've got shelter. So now we just need a reliable source of food. There are plenty more things in Bremin.
