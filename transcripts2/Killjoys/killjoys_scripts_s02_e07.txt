 Who's that new bartender, again? Sabine. It's okay to dwant him. It's when you don't want someone, but you don't want anyone else to have them. So what's disrupting thought patterns got to do with the wall? I don't know, but I found one of the engineers, Artura Senbek, and the word is, she's in Old Town hiding out. I'm meeting her tonight.

No, you know exactly how to help, because you're part of what screwed Old Town in the first place. Your name, it's all over these schematics, Ms. Senbek. I know that you helped design the wall. I'm not blaming you. You worked for the Company, and you did your job. But let's be honest, it was a sh1t job, and you did a shitty thing caging these people in. I think I've paid enough for that. Hmm? Now, see, that's interesting as hells to me. You help engineer the wall, and then they lock you inside it. Why? Because I asked too many stupid questions.

No! No, she just Sixed out on me. Okay, because, you know, you're my brother, and I love you, but... maybe you should think about holstering that thing. Not a good track record. And by the way, Sixes don't have day jobs as Westie bartenders. She was obviously using you. For what? No idea. What the hells do we do with her now? Dutch has to see this. We got to get her cleaned up and on Lucy. How, genius? There's a room full of drunken Westies downstairs. "Oh, hey, don't mind us, we're just kidnapping your sexy bartender, pip-pip." [sighs] Hmm... ♪ ♪ It's Sabine. Yeah. It's Sabine in a bag. Yes. Johnny, why did you bring me Sabine in a bag? Not a lot of better options.

Look, in science-y terms... I think you broke her. Maybe she had some kind of crazy allergic reaction to me?

She's terrified of the Company. Ugh, why is trying to outsmart your own family's evil megacorp so hard? Can't you just make her talk? Not without a warrant. Which is why I want you to take one out on her. Are you sure you want to mess your Killjoys badge up in this? You know, maybe it's time I make the RAC work for me. ♪ ♪ Are you sure this will work? Trust me. I got this. Kind of. ♪ ♪ [groans] [gasps] [panting] Or... [gasps sharply] [panting] Hi. Hi. Hi. [blow lands] Whoa! Dutch! What? Now she's normal unconscious, we can work with that. Get the restraints. Time for 20 questions. Well, we know what you are. Now we need to know why you're here. Why are you spying on us? Khlyen sent me. I don't believe you. I don't believe you can be convinced, so why should I bother trying? Because you're restrained, and I'm violent. I kind of hate that I like you. Don't worry, not mutual. What are Sixes? We're soldiers, working for the true purpose of the RAC. What is the true purpose? How would I know? I'm just a soldier. [scoffs] [weapon clicks and whooshes] This might get tingly. D'Av knocked the superpowers out of you. [whimpers] [panting] If you're gonna use that thing, stop being such a lady about it and get on with it. Got a thing for pain, do we? Maybe we'll do this old-school, real lo-fi. Knock yourself out. I'll just heal. Handy habit, that. But it's the green that keeps you smooth and scar-free, and thanks to D'Av, you're running a little low these days. How long has it been since you felt pain? Like, really, really felt it? Why did Khlyen have you watch D'Avin? To protect him. From what? From you. ♪ ♪ This is bigger than Khlyen and me. Your people have been infecting the RAC for a long time. Why?

I'm not saying braid each other's hair, but you need to be smarter about how you handle this. Oh, really? I'm a torture expert. First, gross. Second, I'm the one she spy-banged, and even I'm saying you're taking this too personally. What's going on? I just don't like the way she used you. Makes me want to punch her face parts. Well, thank you, but I'm a big boy, and we have bigger problems. Like, none of us have ever interrogated a Level VI before, and she just got out of some damn coma. If we get this wrong, we've lost our shot. So how do you suggest we get the answers? We need a RAC expert. No. Someone who has lots of experience with Sixes. Don't say it. Someone with a fine head of hair. Ugh! I hate you. I hate you more. Lucy, hail Turin on a secure line. We are 100% off the grid here. No RAC. A small group of us crazy assholes trying to get to the bottom of what Sixes are. And this is the first time we've ever captured one in the Quad, so it's a big day. You all get a cookie. Whee! ♪ ♪ Who's your creepy friend? He's my creepy interrogator. I call him Phil. Best one we got. Breaking out the fine china for you people. See, the thing about Sixes, the buggers look just like us. And we can't just go around poking Killjoys and seeing who heals. The union would frown at that. If we're ever gonna eradicate Sixes from the RAC, we got to identify them first. That's where D'Avin's little girlfriend comes in. And if creepy Phil is just gonna creepy torture her, I'd have saved you the trouble. Nah, pain doesn't break Sixes. We've come up with a... another technique. Real elegant sh1t. Weenie Jaqobis will like it. [whispers] Me? You. Pupillometric measurement. Ooh. Optical lie detector. Nice. How does it work? The eyes don't lie. Photographs of missing RAC agents are projected inside those goggles, along with an embedded prompt, "Am I a Six?" The computer will register her reactions. [snaps fingers] Just like that, we got a starting list of Level VI agents to target. Target how? We don't even know how to kill them yet. One problem at a time, big hair.

What is this? We call it a Dreadnought. It's an execution stick for Sixes. I thought all you people healed. We have limits. Instant brain death is a pretty big one. Look, I promise, I had to kill him before he killed me. He was a Six. Bullshit. Why would he kill you if he's one of you? To keep me from talking. Just look at him. Please. ♪ ♪ There's partial healing on the edges, and we got plasma. Creepy Phil was a creepy Six. [slow clapping] Well, congratulations. You found the mole. Passed my test. That wasn't a test. No. But it'd be pretty cool if it was. I got to go dark for a while. Clean house. You and your team are on your own. You're taking Sabine, though, right? Can't do it. Her people will probably send the Black Root for her here. Khlyen mentioned them. What are they? They're like a secret police for the Sixes. Keep their people in line. You do not want to meet them. Protect Sabine. Keep her talking, get everything you can out of her. And then? I'm not Khlyen's biggest fan, but I know this, he didn't train you to be weak when it counts.

No, I'm the guy you had s*x with, watched you die, found out you were a Six... and deserves some answers. You do. Sorry. So what do you want to know? Why were you getting close to me? I told you, it was my assignment from Khlyen. Watching over you, keeping you safe. The rest was completely your fault for that incredible jawline. It's okay, you can smile. I won't tell her. [laughs] This isn't about Dutch. Everything you do is a little bit about her, don't you think? Even me. You? I was supposed to be the door closer, right? The move-on lay. Sorry I screwed that up. Still don't regret last night. Oh, really? How about the almost dying part? Yeah, that was less good. Most people just fall asleep after. I had to get all dramatic. What? ♪ ♪ You're bleeding. She's still bleeding from the fight. So? So not healing, killing her own people... She's not exactly a normal Six anymore. Maybe Johnny can... I don't know... Experiment with me. Maybe I can heal her fully somehow. D'Avin, she is playing you. I know, I'm not being yanked around by my shaft. No, by your heart. Tell me you don't feel sorry for her. We should feel sorry for her. Bullshit. She's not some wounded animal we found by the side of the road. You don't get to fix her and keep her. She is a weapon meant to be used against us. And once we get what we can out of her, we're getting rid of her. What is that supposed to mean? What do you think? No, you say it. You want to go back to being Yala? Red Boxes and assassinations? You're better than that. We're not murderers. We are at war. With who? I don't know, because your little bang buddy won't tell me. Then treat her like an enemy combatant. There are conventions, and you don't get to break them. Find another way. Guys, I think I figured out what's happening to Sabine. I had Turin send me a scan of his little headless buddy for comparison with Sabine. Not really up on my brain art, Johnny. What are we seeing? Honestly... I don't know. Micro lesions or neurofungus, all clustered in the anterior insular cortex and hypothalamus... Smaller words. It's like an infection. It shuts down parts of the brain that allow for bonding, empathy, and love. I think we're looking at what makes Sixes. It's like someone invented a way to shut down everything about us that's human and good. Engineered psychopaths? Yeah. But take a look at the scan of Sabine's from this morning. Looks almost normal. Right now, without enough of that sh1t in her system to control her, I think we're seeing the real Sabine. She's having her first true emotions in, what, decades? Why? You. When you two hooked up and she exploded out all that plasma, I think the stuff in her brain started to die off without it. So the cure for Sixes is banging D'Av? [scoffs] Yeah, well, as much as I would like to claim that one for Clan Jaqobis, no. Take a look at this latest scan. It's coming back. Fast. The plasma must have some base titer or viral load it returns to. So it's temporary. Until she turns into a psychopathic Six again. How long do I have? You must be thrilled to get rid of me without having to be the bad guy. I'm not afraid of being the bad guy. There you go, making me like you again. Got to respect an honest bitch. Why did they pick you, Sabine? They track all of us agents. I had the winning combo, strong enough to take the physical transition, broken enough to survive the mental. How do you mean mental? Let's just say, it's not a very efficient process. Most people don't make it through. They go crazy. The green breaks your bonds with anyone you've ever loved. It's like everyone you had any connection to dies on you, all at once. The more damaged and antisocial you are, the better a candidate. Guess I checked the right boxes. Like you. I'm on that list because Khlyen put me there. You're on that list because Khlyen broke you in the cradle. It's not fair, you know? They didn't ask, they just took me and did this. I'm not anybody's puppet. On that, we agree. I'm not dying on this ship. What if I could help you identify all the Sixes, everywhere? One condition. After, you let me go. I can't do that. You know I can't. My people will track me down for betraying them. It's safer if they don't find me here and saves you from having to kill me. They'll do it for you. Deal. ♪ ♪ Well, look who isn't dead. Where's your team? I'm here to pick up a solo warrant. Artura Senbek, Level II. Should be reserved under my name. So it is. Witnessed and locked. [device beeps] Thank you. Oh, hey, maybe don't mention this one to Dutch and D'Av, okay? [device chimes] Let's try that again. Be cool, lady. It's not a big deal. Need I remind you, squirt, the last time you kept a warrant from Dutch, you all ate sh1t sandwiches for a week, and two of you damn near died. You know what? This is none of your business, Bell. I can take a solitary warrant if I want to. I don't have to explain myself to you. You're right. As you were. Hey... Whatever you're up to... they deserve better from you. ♪ ♪ 
 
 So how is this gonna work? I can only identify Sixes I've met, but D'Avin is different because of his gift with the plasma. And what, exactly, is this sh1t? A neurobinder. The combined memories of every Six gets stored here. Really strong Sixes like Khlyen can connect to the green and flip through those memories like a radio dial. From what he tells me, sounds like D'Av can too. Ready? Yes, ma'am. [keys clacking] Give me your hands. [computer beeping] So if he connects to the green while wearing Turin's glasses, he'll be able to ID all the Sixes. Nifty. [inhales deeply] Ready? Ready-ish. It's working. How do I know... [grunts] [groans] [whooshing, beeping] Why'd we stop here? The sky's beautiful, isn't it? Come on. Race you. Wait! Stop. [grunts] What's wrong? [panting] I don't understand. Am I doing it right? Perfect. You're doing perfect. Keep going. Trust me, okay? [grunts] [whooshing, beeping] What is that thing? We need to get inside and find out. [device booms and whooshes] It's resisting me. You're stronger. You can do this. ♪ ♪ [groaning] Something's wrong. Yeah, I see it. Synaptic overload. Hey, Dutch, I can't pull him out. Sabine, let him go. Get him out of there! Now! [yelps] [both panting] Slow, slow, slow. You okay? Dizzy as sh1t. Yeah, I hate that part. Where were we? Not sure. Did we get what you need? I got a sh1t ton of hits before we had to cut the connection. Some of these suckers have last known addresses in Old Town. What are they doing hiding out there? You okay? Hey. So what do we do now? We hand these over to Turin, or we go Six-hunting ourselves? I don't trust her, Johnny. And I don't trust that I don't trust her. Maybe D'Av's right and I just hate her because he doesn't. Do you think I'm too protective of you guys? You? Little bit. But we can take it. D'Av can watch her. She's not gonna go anywhere with a bomb strapped to her neck. But you and I need to go make sure these Sixes are legit. 'Cause if she's playing us, we have to kill her tonight before she goes full Six. And we can't let D'Av stop us. ♪ Chasing the sun ♪

Won't wash off for weeks, and they'll never know we have a fix on them. I don't like this, Johnny. Why are there so many Sixes here, just sitting around doing nothing?

So what was with that silver box thing you were looking for? I wasn't sure if you'd remember. That was me cheating a bit. How?

And then the company will know we've talked. Fine. Greenwell. You know this name? No. It's where they sent us to test the wall. A strange group. Scientists, behaviorists, engineers.

The old, sick, the very young. All dead in one day. One. Like... they were culling a herd. And so what happened to the survivors? Missing. The Company took them away.

You know what's sad? You're already half Six, and you don't even know it. Shut up. Why do you think Khlyen trained you like that? Not how to kill... How not to care.
