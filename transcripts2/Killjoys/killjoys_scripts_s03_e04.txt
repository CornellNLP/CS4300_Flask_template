 Previously, on "Killjoys" Whatever Khlyen did to me gave me some kind of control over the plasma. 
  Delle Seyah. 
  Wasn't sure you'd actually show. 
  [gasping] 
  So you aren't coming back yet. 
  Back home soon. 
  Tap my heart. 
  You are now a black mark on every other RAC unit in the J colonies. 
  Banyon, new head bitch in charge. 
  On what planet were you a warlord? 
  [screaming] 
  Oh, like you don't have skeletons? 
  Zeph! 
  New nerd, meet old nerd. 
  Now, that looks like something you'd call the Remnant. 
  Put your ego aside and figure out how to open this for the team. 
  Or we'll never find Aneela. 
  Welcome to my ship. 
  Tell me everything. 
  [dramatic music] 
  - Okay, baby. 
  Come to Papa. 
  - Don't touch it! 
  The Remnant's core temperature is 50 degrees - below its exterior. 
  - I know. 
  See my pretty gloves? 
  Which won't protect you from a super-pretty plague. 
  Okay, in your corners, nerds. 
  Turin built us this super pretty Black Site so you two pocket protectors can play nice. 
  Now, what's the problem? 
  In normal people words. 
  The Remnant's interior is refrigerated, so whatever's inside is probably organic, and possibly contagious. 
  And you were just gonna laser it in half? 
  Do I tell you how to punch things? 
  So we are no closer to opening it? 
  Depends unzip your shirt and show me your nipples. 
  Remember when we talked about "office appropriate"? 
  It's not for anything weird. 
  I just want to attach these and get some readings. 
  - Of what? 
  - You obviously have some kind of mojo over Hullen plasma and tech. 
  If we can harness that, maybe you can open the Remnant like how you opened the Hullen ship. 
  You sign off on this? 
  Hey, you wanted us to play nice. 
  So, do you want to swallow it, or should I just, like, rub it on you? 
  As much as I love being your guinea bitch, Zeph, me and my nipples are off limits until you can do some more research. 
  - What - Come on, let's go. 
  Where are you going? 
  Killjoy stuff. 
  Today, Johnny becomes a man. 
  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
  I'm not ready. 
  Tradition says five stars, five shots. 
  I was hoping for the alcohol kind. 
  Later. 
  Ready, Jaqobis? 
  Just remember all the hair jokes I didn't make, okay? 
  [grunting] 
  [chuckles] 
  Oh, yeah? 
  [grunting] 
  [all cheering] 
  [grunting] 
  - Fold him in half! 
  - [grunts] 
  Let a girl tag in. 
  Be my guest. 
  [rock music] 
  [laughs] 
  [exhales] 
  [grunts] 
  [cheers and applause] 
  Our newest Level V! 
  Johnny Jaqobis! 
  [cheers and applause] 
  Oh, and, uh, next round's on Turin. 
  Only one! 
  Bunch of degenerates. 
  - Big day for our boy. 
  - I guess. 
  Just feels weird celebrating RAC ranks when we know it's been infiltrated by the Hullen. 
  Not for long, General D. 
  Someone's got that urge to purge. 
  Yeah, but I can't do it alone. 
  And we still have no pilots for our mystery fleet. 
  No heavy infantry. 
  We're on our last keg of Kyrellian Hokk. 
  Then be a peach and bring up a case of Yyzati instead. 
  I like when you lift heavy things. 
  Yeah, okay. 
  Didn't I break his leg once? 
  Gared? 
  Maybe. 
  And then you stabbed him because he was trying to steal your bar. 
  He had some anger issues back then, but we worked it out. 
  He's much better at feelings now. 
  Prima Dezz, are you blushing? 
  Okay, first, I don't blush, I glow. 
  And this is not how barstool privilege works, princess. 
  Everything on my side of the bar is my business. 
  Everything on your side of the bar is my business. 
  Hey. 
  Thanks. 
  Getting a promotion when your bosses might be evil parasites kind of takes the "yay" out of it, but man, I really wanted my Level V. 
  Got to fill up those upper ranks, so many Killjoys missing. 
  Would have V'd you a long time ago, but your sister-partner there shot me down every time I tried. 
  Dutch rank-blocked me? 
  Why? 
  Congrats, Jaqobis. 
  You accept drinks from out-of-townies? 
  I always accept drinks from the little people. 
  Thanks. 
  No sides, no bribes. 
  All: The Warrant is all. 
  Name's Flik. 
  You've been locked and served. 
  [laughs] 
  Yeah, right. 
  Whoa, like hells I am! 
  For what? 
  For the murder of Delle Seyah Kendry. 
  [dramatic music] 
  [rock music] 
  Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh No one's taking Johnny anywhere. 
  Just doing my job. 
  Black Warrant came through Banyon. 
  - Take it up with her. 
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
  Cool your assholes. 
  As ranking officer, I order you to lower your God damn weapons. 
  [tense music] 
  - What about them? 
  - We never listen to him. 
  - Dutch - Johnny was gone for months, and the Nine didn't say sh1t about Delle Seyah. 
  - Why get a Warrant now? 
  - It's a mistake, obviously. 
  Little Jaqobis would never kill a Niner. 
  He's the smart one. 
  Yeah, Johnny, tell them. 
  The Warrant's legit? 
  Now that we all agree [guns charging] 
  [grunts] 
  [rock music] 
  No kill shots till we sort this out! 
  - Should I turn myself in? 
  - Shut up and shoot. 
  Aah! 
  sh1t! 
  I thought you took no sides! 
  - I also take no sh1t! 
  - [grunts] 
  Black Warrants are open Warrants. 
  - They're just gonna keep coming. 
  - You called it, sugar cheeks. 
  Remote cams show more on the way. 
  Come on. 
  D'av'll have to catch up. 
  Keep 'em busy, D'av. 
  [grunting] 
  [whistles] 
  Be a lamb and lock up? 
  You're coming back, though, right? 
  Right? 
  - How many behind us, Luce? 
  - Three speeders closing in, and four registered Killjoy ships just entered Westerley's atmosphere. 
  If we want to get ahead of the wolf pack, I suggest we scooch. 
  Yesterday. 
  Scooching. 
  [rousing music] 
  Who wants my brother? 
  Well above my pay grade, buddy. 
  Aah! 
  [grunting] 
  D'av, Lucy's got too many admirers. 
  You need to hitch a ride with Turin. 
  Send me coordinates as soon as you've got them. 
  - Drop your guns! 
  - Aah! 
  Aah! 
  Ugh! 
  [panting] 
  [gunshots] 
  Come on, Jaqobis. 
  Killjoy to Killjoy. 
  You really gonna shoot a brother of the badge? 
  I only have one brother. 
  Aah! 
  Huh? 
  When I catch those little ass nuggets, I'm gonna peel their balls like grapes. 
  You know, that's really violent imagery, man. 
  Shut up, hippie. 
  All their weapons were on "stun. 
  " No one uses "stun" for a Black Warrant. 
  Stun. 
  Aah! 
  Oh. 
  I'm okay! 
  The Warrant's to capture Johnny, not kill him. 
  - They want him alive. 
  - Then things are looking up. 
  - I'm just gonna rest for a bit. 
  - Ass-up, but up. 
  Up? 
  We were completely blindsided. 
  How could you now know there was a Warrant on one of your own? 
  How could you not know your brother killed Delle Seyah? 
  If he did, it was in self-defense. 
  Johnny wouldn't murder anyone. 
  He doesn't have it in him. 
  Go to Banyon, find a way to fix this. 
  But her icing me out means she doesn't trust me any more than I trust her, and we still don't know whether she's playing for the Hullen. 
  What do we do with him? 
  He a bleeder? 
  Dump him somewhere. 
  Can't lock up a Killjoy on a legal warrant. 
  Draw too much attention. 
  But he'll go straight after Johnny. 
  Furry Jaqobis'll be fine. 
  He's got Dutch and a whole galaxy to hide in. 
  But it ain't gonna change the fact that he killed a God damn Niner. 
  Delle Seyah Kendry is a traitor and a murderer. 
  If he did kill her, he should get a God damn medal. 
  [sighs] 
  I'll head for Borian's Belt. 
  The asteroids should buy us some cover. 
  What is it with you and asteroids? 
  They're hard and full of secrets. 
  - Like you. 
  - Secrets. 
  Like how you forgot to tell us you're wanted for murder? 
  Delle Seyah was one of the Nine, John. 
  Live or dead, she still has allies. 
  [solemn music] 
  - What is it? 
  - The green is a living repository for our collective Hullen memories. 
  We transfer all our experiences, all our knowledge into it. 
  What's the point of eternal life if you can't remember all you've lived? 
  Sounds like a living data cloud. 
  Or a biocomputer. 
  Poor bunny. 
  Your mind is still so adorably human. 
  Don't worry. 
  That will fade. 
  Show me how it works. 
  [rumbling] 
  [gasps] 
  Slowly. 
  It can be overwhelming. 
  [heavy breathing] 
  [rumbling] 
  [gasps] 
  Ah. 
  Whoa. 
  What was that? 
  The beginning. 
  We've still got a tail loose. 
  The field's magnetic interference is masking our ionic signature. 
  We appear to have shaken them for now. 
  Speak up if you detect any ships coming into range. 
  I'm detecting a range of emotion in your voice, John. 
  - Do you require a tissue? 
  - I'm good, girl. 
  Just kicking myself for coming back. 
  Why didn't you tell us about Delle Seyah? 
  The Nine go pretty hard for revenge p0rn. 
  I didn't want you or D'av playing a starring role. 
  But you should have come to us. 
  Before you killed her. 
  I didn't want you to stop me. 
  I wanted her dead. 
  I'm not sorry, Dutch. 
  Maybe I should be, but I'm not. 
  You can't protect me from every punch. 
  Even though you keep trying. 
  Magnetic storm's rolling in. 
  I suggest we not be near any big, floaty rocks when she hits. 
  We're still safer in here as long as that Warrant is still active. 
  John needs a place to lay low. 
  You need recruits for our war. 
  What if I can work a little two-for-one special? 
  [sighs] 
  You are so lucky I hopped this train. 
  - I don't care what Turin says. 
  - He's talking before he's walking. 
  [tense music] 
  Aah! 
  - What the - Hey, buddy. 
  - How you feeling? 
  - Upside-downy. 
  How about telling me where you were taking my brother? 
  How about shoving a knuckle wrench up your butt? 
  - [grunts] 
  - Aah! 
  [laughing] 
  - [groaning] 
  - I apologize. 
  We'll try that again. 
  Where were you taking Johnny? 
  I don't know Aah! 
  Ugh! 
  Okay, orders are to get him in cryo and wait for extraction coordinates. 
  - Why cryo? 
  - Because wherever they're taking him, it sure as hells ain't a day trip. 
  Well, Johnny's way off the grid by now. 
  Good luck finding him. 
  [grunts] 
  So no pool where we're going? 
  Ohron's more of an ice rink kind of moon. 
  Ohron? 
  - No way. 
  - All the way, baby. 
  Uh, what way are we talking about? 
  Ohron is home of the Ferran, the most badass outlaw mercenaries in the J. 
  - How do you not know this? 
  - Because I grew up a slave princess in a harem, and you grew up reading comic books and building robot dogs. 
  Solid point, but wait wait a minute. 
  Only the Ferran know Ohron's location. 
  How in the hells did you get it? 
  I may have kinda run with them for a bit. 
  But people get so shady when you say you're ex-Ferran. 
  Won't the old gang be a bit pissed that you've given up their secret base? 
  Family forgives right? 
  [engines whirring] 
  [rock music] 
  I hope Pree didn't grow his hair out for nothing. 
  It's all about making an entrance. 
  Blond? 
  Did not see that coming. 
  The man is a cave of wonders. 
  Flare shot. 
  The beacon is lit. 
  The Johnny is impressed. 
  How long do we wait for? 
  Oh, honey bun. 
  They're already here. 
  Particle displacement shield. 
  Nice. 
  So great to meet you guys. 
  Huge fans. 
  Huge. 
  I come claiming sanctuary. 
  Who makes the claim? 
  Prima Dezz. 
  Who you knew as Varrick. 
  - Varrick? 
  - Both: Varrick? 
  Does "Prima Dezz" sound like a warlord to you? 
  [romantic music] 
  Close family. 
  [guns charging] 
  [both grunt] 
  [wincing] 
  You haven't changed. 
  You raging meat stick. 
  Well, Pree definitely has a type. 
  You got balls coming back here, Varrick. 
  You used to like that about me. 
  You swore to lead us until death. 
  You led the Ferran? 
  Teensy bit. 
  Varrick swore to lead you. 
  And Varrick died during the Jasper raids. 
  Prima Dezz hopped a freighter to Westerley. 
  If it was all lies, you're dumber than I thought coming back here. 
  You know the price of betrayal. 
  I risked it to help save a good man. 
  Like I did once for you, Lachlan. 
  - This the man? 
  - Yeah, but we're not we're not, like, together. 
  [clears throat] 
  Johnny's being hunted. 
  Like you all once were. 
  Accuse me of whatever you want. 
  But deny him, and you betray everything the Ferran believe. 
  What about her? 
  We're a package deal. 
  We're prepared to pay our keep. 
  The finest weaponry money can't buy. 
  - It's not enough. 
  - What? 
  Do you know what you can get for a double-cannon Nitrobarken? 
  It's not even legal in half the J. 
  What do you want, Lachlan? 
  Your life for their safety will do just fine. 
  [dramatic music] 
  Drag a comb through that nest. 
  Do us all a favor. 
  I should have been told there was a Black Warrant on Jaqobis. 
  And if I had, Johnny Jaqobis would have ran, and been right back up on that wall. 
  Magically slipped through our fingers again. 
  Internal Affairs isn't your damn job. 
  You couldn't do my job. 
  That's why I'm here. 
  Oh, and I read your files on "Team Awesome Force. 
  " Sweetest hate letter ever written. 
  But even with them breaking every God damn rule, none of it ever sticks. 
  Got a point, or are we just talking dirty? 
  Why are you protecting them, Turin? 
  If they swore an oath, I got their back. 
  Even the assholes get a fair shake. 
  - That's the way I lead. 
  - And that's why you'll fall. 
  Jaqobis killed Delle Seyah. 
  Here's your proof. 
  [muffled voices, static] 
  Where's the rest of the footage? 
  That's all Turin sent from the old Company street cams. 
  He shot her in the gut, not the head. 
  - You think she survived? 
  - No state funeral. 
  No backstabbing to replace her. 
  It's a pretty quiet exit for a drama queen like Delle Seyah. 
  Well, maybe there's something in the alley-cam archives. 
  Pree has alley-cams? 
  Oh, bless his little voyeur heart. 
  - [tense music] 
  - Why would you bring us here if your ex was gonna kill you? 
  Lachlan used to find me very charming. 
  - So what happened to you guys? 
  - [sighs] 
  Oh, you know: boy meets boy, they fall in love, it's all sunsets and fireworks until it isn't. 
  How long since you ran out on him? 
  Long enough to imagine all the ways to make me suffer for it. 
  [sighs] 
  But whatever our history, Lachlan's a man of his word. 
  The Ferran will protect Johnny. 
  Now, the two of you need to figure out a way to save my sweet tush. 
  What you said before, about the Ferran being hunted? 
  The Ferran are all refugee soldiers from corrupt wars. 
  You mean deserters. 
  Ah-ah, conscientious deserters. 
  The Ferran believe a true soldier risks his life for more than corporate or feudal interests. 
  Like, say, saving an entire human race? 
  Whatever you're gonna do, make sure Lachlan eats first. 
  He's a real bear when his blood sugar crashes. 
  Do not poke the bear. 
  Cramming for exams? 
  Standing contract on Muvallah. 
  I've already sent half my people. 
  How are you at running campaigns? 
  I'm more of a "mission" girl. 
  Killjoy, right. 
  I know why you're here, but Varrick broke our laws. 
  I couldn't save him if I wanted to. 
  But if all the Ferran are deserters, how is what Pree did any different? 
  The Ferran fight for two things: just wars and each other. 
  Pree betrayed both when he hopped a freighter to Westerley. 
  Pree risked his life for Old Town when the Company bombed it to sh1t. 
  That is not a man who ran out on honor. 
  - He abandoned his post. 
  - He abandoned you. 
  Isn't that what this is really about? 
  - Careful. 
  - I don't have time to be careful. 
  The war Pree and I are getting ready to fight will shake the entire J. 
  Free him. 
  Join us. 
  It will be the Ferran's most righteous fight yet. 
  'Cause if the Hullen win, everything you fight for dies. 
  Justice, freedom, honor. 
  Now, what would a Killjoy know about honor? 
  I know that you are killing a good man because of a broken heart. 
  Where's the honor in that? 
  [beeping] 
  [sighs] 
  Sorry about shooting you before. 
  It's not cool. 
  Happens all the time. 
  I got that kind of face. 
  Pree seems to like it. 
  - Are you and Pree - Hells if I know. 
  Man's locked up tighter than a Niner's asshole. 
  Yeah, well, Johnny forgot to mention that he murdered the Queen of the Quad. 
  Both: Dudes Oh, here we go. 
  [dramatic music] 
  Always double tap, Johnny. 
  Well, at least now you got proof. 
  You gonna send it to Turin? 
  No. 
  This calls for a personal delivery. 
  I've made my decision. 
  You'll be tried by proxy. 
  Two champions competing, one for Pree's life Dutch. 
  I choose Dutch. 
  - Sorry, Pumpkin. 
  - Ah The other for an alliance with the Ferran - against the Hullen - Son of a bitch. 
  - And on trial for the Ferran - Don't do it Will be John Jaqobis. 
  Our friend's life or the lives of the entire J. 
  Let your honor decide which is the worthier fight. 
  Well, then. 
  You poked the bear, didn't you? 
  Each champion must undergo three trials: strength of body, mind, and spirit. 
  May their honor lead them to victory. 
  [cheering] 
  My honor's feeling a bit drafty. 
  First to cut the sigil from their opponent without drawing blood takes the challenge. 
  Trial begins. 
  [cheering] 
  - So how we doing this? 
  - Carefully. 
  I don't want to accidentally hurt you. 
  Make it look good when you lose. 
  Whoa, hang on. 
  You think that I can't win? 
  [both grunting] 
  Uh-oh. 
  Got one. 
  Careful, we're fighting for Pree's life. 
  You don't have to win [grunts] 
  All three. 
  Aah! 
  This one's mine. 
  [tense music] 
  What the hells? 
  What are you doing? 
  I'm just putting on a good show. 
  [both grunting] 
  First trial is over! 
  Oh, sh1t, did I win? 
  Not even close. 
  You may be Level V, but I trained for VI. 
  [sighs] 
  But you have proof Delle Seyah is alive. 
  We take Warrants, Jaqobis, not sides. 
  The Warrant is bullshit. 
  Why? 
  So he didn't kill her then. 
  Prove he didn't kill her later. 
  Or is this home movie all you've got? 
  Delle Seyah is behind this. 
  John is being set up. 
  If you want to, you could challenge the Warrant. 
  You want me to challenge this Warrant? 
  Drag her highness in here by the hair. 
  Prove she's still alive. 
  Until then, get the hells out of my office. 
  [dark music] 
  First to shoot the target takes the challenge of the mind. 
  Pretty simple. 
  So where does the mind part come in? 
  Oh. 
  Gotcha. 
  Begin. 
  50 joy says I smoke your ass. 
  100 says you eat that. 
  [rock music] 
  Oh, it is on. 
  Yes. 
  Eat it, Jaqobis [explosion] 
  I'm sorry, eat what? 
  Is the answer my dick? 
  [clears throat] 
  Khlyen's mystery box can wait. 
  Johnny killed Delle Seyah and now she's after him. 
  Not sure that makes sense. 
  Baroness von Batshit's gone full Hullen. 
  - Hmm. 
  - Oh, now that makes sense. 
  Somehow she, or whoever's helping her, ordered a Black Warrant on Johnny. 
  If we can find her, we've got a shot at shutting it down. 
  I used the green goo to connect to the Hullen's memory before. 
  Maybe I can do the same thing now that Delle Seyah's on the juice. 
  [tense music] 
  This is for science, remember? 
  I read John's research. 
  When the Hullen connect to the plasma, there is a surge of electrical activity in the hippocampus. 
  We'll try and match their brain's electrical activity by amping yours up. 
  [sighs] 
  Okay. 
  [sighs] 
  It's never just beer and fritters. 
  [exhales] 
  Ready? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Aah! 
  [beeping] 
  [panting] 
  Anything? 
  A hemorrhage. 
  So not that. 
  [sighs] 
  Nerds. 
  Final challenges tests the spirit. 
  Chains, leather, blindfolds. 
  Do we need your safe word? 
  We're all chained by something. 
  This will help you see by what. 
  [dramatic music] 
  First one to free themselves wins. 
  Remember, Johnny. 
  It's for Pree. 
  We're even now. 
  This one's mine, okay? 
  Got it, boss. 
  Ooh. 
  Why are my eyes vomiting? 
  [eerie music] 
  [laughing] 
 
 
 
  The drink. 
  We must be tripping our balls off. 
  Uh-oh. 
  There's no more walls for you to hide behind. 
  - [chuckles] 
  - What is up with you? 
  I've been sensing this hot whiff of bitchery from you all day. 
  I know that you blocked Turin from giving me my Level V. 
  That should have stayed in my head. 
  Oh, sh1t. 
  I think we've been dosed with Truth Jakk. 
  Truth Jakk? 
  Really? 
  Your hair is too big for your face, you leave knives everywhere, and your pottery's terrible. 
  Okay, okay, okay. 
  The truth sets you free. 
  I get it. 
  Look, blocking your Level V was a shitty thing to do. 
  But I did it to protect you. 
  You weren't ready. 
  I'm pretty sure that's not your choice. 
  Level Vs are cleared for Kill Warrants. 
  Cold-blooded executions. 
  That's not you, Johnny. 
  I put a bullet in Delle Seyah. 
  That was me. 
  And you couldn't handle it. 
  You ran away with Clara to play house. 
  You know, Lucy sulked for months. 
  I took a little space because my girlfriend is murdered, and you're inviting baby nerds onto our ship. 
  What, Zeph? 
  We needed her help. 
  You were gone. 
  I was gonna come back. 
  I didn't want you to. 
  [sighs] 
  You know, when I first met you, you were Johnny Jaqobis. 
  Lover of ponies, sunshine optimist. 
  You weren't a murderer. 
  And I won't watch you turn into me. 
  Who I am has nothing to do with you. 
  I am not the angel on your shoulder. 
  It is not my job to stop you from going full Khlyen and murdering everyone that gets in your way. 
  You could stop yourself, but you don't want to, because revenge feels good, and I know that now. 
  And I know that that's what this war is all about for you. 
  It's not about saving the J. 
  It's not about killing the Hullen. 
  You want to destroy Aneela to prove to dead Daddy K that you are better than her. 
  Well, I am. 
  And I'm gonna win. 
  They have more ships, they have more guns, and they can turn every one of us into one of them. 
  We can't win this, Dutch. 
  Then why did you come back? 
  [clanging] 
  [misting] 
  [coughing] 
  Uh where's all this smoke coming from? 
  [coughing] 
  Whoo! 
  Smells like a sad drum circle in here. 
  [dramatic music] 
  Balls. 
  Guess it's buy one, get one free. 
  We done? 
  Did we win? 
  Where in the hells are we? 
  Our comms are jammed, we're heavily restrained in sh1t, I'd say. 
  [tense music] 
  Did we break up back there? 
  Kind of felt like we broke up. 
  Look, you wanted space. 
  I gave you space. 
  I was talking "actual space" space. 
  Not between us. 
  You know, it's really hard when Mommy and Daddy fight. 
  [grunting] 
  What happened? 
  Where are Dutch and John? 
  You promised to protect them. 
  Trial is forfeit. 
  It's not our problem anymore. 
  Oh, I'm about to give your ass one. 
  [shouting] 
  [grunting] 
  I want you to listen real close, lover boy. 
  Skipping out on you? 
  Real dick move. 
  And I'm sorry for it. 
  Very, very sorry. 
  I don't care anymore. 
  [grunting, shouting] 
  But I did. 
  I would have died for you, Varrick. 
  I know. 
  That's why I left. 
  You were born to lead the Ferran. 
  But the only way to take that place was for me to die. 
  One commander falls Another rises. 
  Ferran law. 
  [solemn music] 
  I left because you started risking your life to protect mine. 
  I wasn't gonna let you die. 
  Not for me. 
  [sighs] 
  For what it's worth, leaving you burned a hole in my heart. 
  Good. 
  So You gonna forgive my gorgeous ass so we can save my friends? 
  These puppies emit 300 volts if you step outside my drop pod. 
  No one wants to pass out in the middle of an icy moon. 
  Hypothermia and all. 
  How did you find us? 
  Because I'm amazing. 
  You put a tracker in my shot glass. 
  - [collar beeping] 
  - Because I'm amazing. 
  Now say your good-byes while I prepare the cryo-pod for one Jaqobis popsicle. 
  Back in a jiff. 
  [dramatic music] 
  - Hey. 
  - Hmm? 
  [grunts] 
  Do you know what? 
  Maybe we're not even really here. 
  Maybe we're still trapped on that Ferran drugathon. 
  - Aah. 
  - You think so? 
  Ow. 
  - Brat. 
  - You love it. 
  Yeah, I do. 
  You're all grown up now. 
  Revenge killing like a big boy. 
  I'm still me, Dutch, with just a hint of mad pirate. 
  Because that's what the ladies like. 
  You know, I never wanted you gone. 
  I just wanted you to be safe. 
  When did we ever play it safe? 
  Do you really think we're gonna lose this war? 
  Well, the numbers suck. 
  But if there is a way, my bones tell me it's following you. 
  [beeping] 
  And that is why I came back. 
  You know, I would have picked that lock in half the time. 
  - Brat. 
  - You love it. 
  [laughs softly] 
  - [buzzing] 
  - Aah! 
  Oh, don't look so grouchy. 
  I said "a jiff. 
  " Time to put Jaqobis on ice. 
  [sighs] 
  Cocoa? 
  That's how you apologize to me for nearly frying my brain? 
  Steeped Makha root. 
  Natural opioid and mild hallucinogen. 
  Ah, you want me to get high. 
  Meditation and hallucinogens can access parts of the brain we normally can't. 
  Instead of forcing a connection, we'll try a gentler way in. 
  [tense music] 
  Now, be specific when keying into Delle Seyah's memories. 
  Did she wear perfume? 
  Smell is one of the most powerful memory triggers. 
  You want me to get high and sniff her panties? 
  [gasps] 
  Do you have some? 
  We really need to work on the whole joke thing. 
  [sighs] 
  Cheers. 
  Ugh [exhales] 
  Picture Delle Seyah in your mind. 
  Listen to the rhythm. 
  Close your eyes. 
  [metronome clicking] 
  [gasps] 
  [dark music] 
  I can hear you mouth-breathing from here. 
  I'm almost used to your creepy little lurk. 
  Ah How are you lessons coming? 
  I hear the commander is teaching you the green. 
  I've always been a quick study. 
  Then you know there are no secrets from it. 
  After advising the Admiral, she agreed to call off the Warrant for your Killjoy. 
  It risked exposing us. 
  We don't want a repeat of Arkyn. 
  And you skipped all the way here to tell me, didn't you? 
  You're Hullen now. 
  Your old human vendettas are beneath you. 
  I thought you didn't think much was beneath me. 
  Hm. 
  I always forget how young you are. 
  It takes time to accept the change. 
  But a word of caution: if you feel the commander's affections allow you to do as you please Aneela always tires of her toys. 
  And then she breaks them. 
  [dramatic music] 
  I'll unjam your ship's comms as soon as I'm out of orbit. 
  Promise. 
  Anything else you need? 
  We want your stay with us to be comfortable. 
  Awkward request then? 
  Yes, I am free for drinks next week. 
  Itch I can't scratch. 
  Be a lad and help a girl out. 
  See, now it feels like that's gonna start with a back rub and end in a headlock. 
  Busted. 
  You really are amazing. 
  Water instead, then, please. 
  That I can do. 
  [suspenseful music] 
  Thanks. 
  Thirsty kitten. 
  Ah. 
  Oh, balls! 
  Wha Wha what did you do to my eyes? 
  [beeping] 
  Nerve gas implants. 
  Add water then bite. 
  Johnny! 
  Johnny, you're okay. 
  They all look like angels when they sleep. 
  Cavalry's here. 
  You're late. 
  Oh. 
  Oh. 
  Wake him when he's near a hot shower. 
  I'm cold, I'm tired, and I'm not making smart choices. 
  So if I shoot you, do I get to be boss, or Pree? 
  Lachlan's already onside. 
  When the Hullen come, the Ferran will answer. 
  No. 
  No, not if it means that Pree has to die on this cold sore of a moon. 
  Pree's free to go. 
  Varrick paid the Ferran price. 
  I had to put out. 
  A lot. 
  Thank you. 
  Guess this is, uh [sighs] 
  Guess it's never really over until you bang your ex, right? 
  [sighs] 
  Why did you let Gander call off the warrant? 
  I wanted Jaqobis brought here. 
  Who are you? 
  Aneela? 
  Are you all right? 
  You see me? 
  Aneela? 
  What did Daddy do to you? 
  You're the same. 
  You're exactly the same. 
  Tell her I'll see her soon. 
  Turin's confirmed it. 
  The Warrant's off. 
  Praise the trees. 
  What's the ETA on Sleeping Beauty? 
  Any minute. 
  That calls for a drink. 
  Uh, my ship, my bar. 
  Barstool privilege. 
  [bar music playing] 
  It's nice to see Lachlan and you made up. 
  We made out. 
  Not the same. 
  A kiss for an army. 
  Not a bad trade. 
  They say "Make love, not war. 
  " I say why choose? 
  Thank you. 
  For saving my life. 
  The way that man kissed you, he was never gonna kill you. 
  So what do you think's next? 
  Invite him home? 
  Meet the parents? 
  We tried playing house, but Lachlan's happiest when he's bashing skulls for justice. 
  And you know me, I do not come second. 
  I think you might come first in Gared's books. 
  We'll see if he survives basic training. 
  Ah Oh, it stirs. 
  Ah Hey. 
  Oh, Dutch Did you sleep well? 
  - Ah - Good. 
  Welcome to Level V. 
  [grunts] 
  Ah No more pulling punches. 
  - Ah - Tap my heart. 
  [hip-hop music] 
  [gasps] 
  Grow my wings like a butterfly And she saw you? 
  Just like Khlyen when I was in his memory. 
  Only it was Aneela's, I think. 
  What was she like? 
  Powerful. 
  Possibly bonkers. 
  [sighs] 
  She's coming for you, Dutch. 
  Good. 
  Solves the sh1t out of finding her. 
  Hmm. 
  She's not alone. 
  [dramatic music] 
  Delle Seyah's with her. 
  John, she's Hullen. 
  You didn't kill her. 
  I'm ready for round two if she is. 
  I've been on their ship. 
  It's a God damn city. 
  We are gonna need serious backup. 
  It's time we take what's ours back. 
  RAC by RAC, one by one, starting with our own. 
  You talking bug hunt? 
  I'm talking God damn revolution. 
  Time to take back the RAC. 
  Oh, oh, hallelujah I climb up through the trees I'm strong enough to bleed I grow my wings like a butterfly Well, I sing the hallelujah
