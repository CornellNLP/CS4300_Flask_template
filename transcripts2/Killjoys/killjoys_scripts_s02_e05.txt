 Yes! 
 Lucy, I think I found the plans for the wall. 
 The company's building a cage for this entire moon. 
 I can't just sit by and watch. 
 Don't put faith in my family. 
 I'm not. My faith's in you, Red. 
 I wish I could be more help with whatever demons are haunting you. 
 I'm starting to think my demons are haunting all of us. 
 I don't think Khlyen's your enemy. 
 I don't think you get a say in that. 
 Brought you here to make you a Level VI. 
 Apparently it didn't work. 
 I need to know why. 
 Set a course for Town. 
 It's the Jaqobis home planet. Then let's make this count. [indistinct chatter] Put those fingers near my face again, and you lose them... all of them. [electronic voice] My brother's just, uh, flirting with you. You should see his other attachments. I'll pass. You have the goods? [electronic voice] Genuine Company retro cell. You can run any ship you've got for a year before a refuel. How much you want for this? Joy's no good in Old Town since the wall went up. We could use, uh, some Leithian latex for my brother's next invention. [dramatic music] Deal. [spits] [clears throat] [squishing] Identity confirmed. Sorry, boys. RAC agents. You're locked and served. [electricity crackling] [all grunting] ♪ ♪ What'd I tell you about getting those nasty things in my face? [grunts] [groaning] [electricity crackling] Let's tag 'em and take 'em to Bellus. I'll let him know. Maybe Johnny can help. And maybe I took your advice. I'm not bugging him while he's on his escort warrant with Princess Pouty. Good for you. I just don't see why he's so wrapped up in Pawter. Have you met Boobs? Shut up. Johnny's not like that. Have you met Johnny? Fine, I give up. Look, I miss the little sh1t too. You want to bitch about it over a drink at the Royale? Oh, you're awfully thirsty lately. Who's that new bartender again? Sassy? Sandwich? Sabine. [grunting] Help me get these two charmers onto Lucy and then go make nice with the ladyfolk... like your brother is. _ I knew your family was rich, but I didn't know they were rich. I still can't believe I'm here. Just remember, this is for Old Town. How about you remember? I'll drink. Thank you, Kaster. It's good to have you home, Seyah Simms. I hope my mother feels the same. There used to be a family of four in this picture. Points for being thorough. Look, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna get the order of exile rescinded, and then I am gonna take you to this little place on Leith to celebrate. They serve drinks in pinecones. I mean, how cute is that? Now you're talking. Well, hello, hello. Johnny, this is Louella, my sister. Louella, this is Johnny. Has it really been since the whole you getting high and that guy dying on your surgery table thing? [chuckles] Sorry, does your porter know about that? Not porter. I'm officially escorting Ms. Simms as an agent of the RAC. Oh. A Killjoy. Love scoundrels. Kind of short to be a scoundrel, eh, big guy? This is my fiancé, Hank. Well, Pawter, obviously you know Hank. Congratulations. It was a surprise to hear about the engagement. Yeah, what can I say? Your folks love me. How you doing, P? Still know how to have a good time, huh? Pawter, is that you? Dad. I know you weren't expecting me. When is a daughter not welcome home? Hmm? It's been too long. [laid-back music] ♪ ♪ Wow. Been coming here so often, you know my drink. You mean beer? Hey, maybe you can do me a favor next time you're through the wall. Well, it depends. What do you need? Peaches. Peaches? My gramps grew Leithian vale peaches on his farm. Used to spend summers there. Guess I'm homesick. Where are you from? Telen. Ring world at the ass end of the J. Ah. Family issues, yeah. Say no more. I didn't say anything about family. So you came halfway across the galaxy to drink and flirt with strange women in a mining bar because you had a stable upbringing? This is flirting? Because I remember it being less uncomfortable. [laughs] [both laughing] [eerie music] Oh... [humming] What is that tune? What tune? You okay, D'Av? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just need some... some air. ♪ ♪ [gasps] D'Avin! [humming] [pulsating tone] We're making our approach. Still no sign of the Black Root? Big, black ship, lots of guns, headed right for us? Think I'd notice. [clears throat] I'll take one of their toys to use against them, just in case. Good. Now... I'm linked with Jaqobis. He'll lead us to our destination. _ [engines roaring] Let's go meet the family. [rock music] ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ So you decided not to take my advice about staying safe in Spring Hill? Well, you know me and advice. Last Jakk, I was a psychotic asshole. Language. It's good to have you home, Pawts. I'm glad you think so. What about the lady of the land? Can I see her? Why don't I help you with whatever you need? Because you're only a Simms by marriage, Dad. It takes a pureborn to lift an order of exile. Lift the order of... Oh, Pawter, you know what your mother will say. Just tell her that I'm ready to take my place as a true and rightful daughter of the Nine. You forget that I actually know when you're bullshitting, dear. [sighs] The Company is up to something bad, and I need to sit on the board to help stop it, for Old Town. I wish you wouldn't get so wrapped up with Old Town. Then you shouldn't have let her exile me there. That's my home now, Dad. Note to self: don't mention this part of the mission to Dutch or D'Av. Oh, so much water, it's like being licked by angels. We need to get you some clothes and start going over the rituals. Dad's organized a Qreshi family dinner, and everybody has to attend by custom. Look, I know this probably sounds crazy to you, but... Are you naked? No. [sighs] Just my bum. 'Cause you seem pretty naked. Oh, n-naked, yeah. I just figured private pool and all. It's a family baptismal. I'll get out. But, Pawter... look, your folks are just people. Relax. Has there ever been a woman in your life who responded well to "relax"? Point taken. Adaline Simms is not just people. She's terrifying. Hey, you want scary, you should've met my old man, the sheriff. He's why D'Avin left home. [snoring] Marris Jaqobis. Hmm? We need to talk... [shouts] [grunting] About your son, D'Avin. [dramatic music] Didn't hear you come on board. You ready to go? Sooner the better. How did the date go? You make her laugh? I'm gonna assume so. It's the kind of thing you'd notice. Yeah, I probably would've if I didn't pass out in the middle of it. Pass out how exactly? Really don't feel like reliving that intense embarrassment, thanks. Well, try. What happened? [sighs] We're talking. My head felt weird. Then I'm on the ground. The last time your head went weird, you tried to kill me. Yeah, but you won. ♪ ♪ [sighs] Well, I already freaked out one woman today. Don't want you worrying too. Yeah, I'll just hold on to it for now. Yeah. I'll go ready the prisoners. [sighs] [humming] [gun cocks] Okay, you don't like my singing. The only person who knows that song is Khlyen. He wrote it for me. So how is his song in your head? [sighs] I told you, the last time I saw D'Avin, he was taking a swing at me. I told him, "You join the military, or I lock you up." And I haven't seen that little sh1t since. Charming. Aw, come on, huh? I don't even know what you guys are looking for. Not to worry. Your reaction to this is what we're looking for. No. No. No! No! [yelling] So dramatic. Your boys are better under pressure. You look nice. Thank you. Yeah. [gong clangs] [sprightly orchestral music] Do you remember what we went over? Yes. Just follow me. [gong clangs] ♪ ♪ Louella Seyah Simms and her betrothed, Henrik Pelantus. Thank you, Seyah Simms. Long may your shores remain. ♪ ♪ And I thank you, Seyah. Thank you, Seyah... For the warmth. Warmth. [stammering] Home? Sand. Sand. And home. Thank you. Thank... you have a beautiful home. ♪ ♪ Mm-hmm. Mm, mm. [whispers] Now? Yeah. [gong clangs] Seriously? Master of the house, Wamer Seyah Simms. I thank you for the warmth... Shh! Mm-mm. No? Okay. [gong clangs] And lady of the land, daughter of the Nine, protector of the soil and sea, Adaline Seyah Simms. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [whispering] Sit. What? It's in order of honor to the home. I go last. [gong clangs] [sniffs] So, Pawter, you'll never guess what I've taken up. Guess. Um... Deepwater diving. Good for you. Kaster, would you go and get the boats ready? I'd like to take a cruise after dinner. Dear? Mm? Pawter was telling me about Old Town and, um, well, other things. Mother, father, let me first say thank you for allowing me to come home when I... No. [somber music] I haven't even said what I want yet. You're going to ask for my order of exile to be lifted, and I'm going to say no. Let's not make it awkward. But you're welcome to finish your dinner before you go. ♪ ♪ No, wait, we have a ritual for leaving. Yeah. But I'm not from Qresh, so I don't give a sh1t. ♪ ♪ Pawter? [sighs] ♪ ♪ Are you okay? I mean, I know that you're not okay, but... [sighs] I'm just gonna... I'm gonna keep saying words here until you stop me, so... It's amazing how quickly you can go from being a grown-up doctor in Old Town to a little girl at the dinner table. ♪ ♪ It's fine. I'm gonna go back in there. No, like hells you will. We're leaving. Johnny, I'm okay. My mother's just an intimidating woman. No, your mother is an asshole. They all are. You deserve better, Pawter Simms. So do the people of Old Town. Isn't that why we came here? Are you asking me as your official RAC escort? Or as Johnny Jaqobis... scoundrel? [groaning] [tense music] ♪ ♪ What's wrong with his face? [shivering] Kaster? [moaning] What happened to you? No, no, watch out. Watch out. Stay back. Something out... ♪ ♪ In... in the fog... [cracking] Ugh! [shattering] [Louella sniffs, exhales] I'm the one who sent him down to the shore. [sniffs] And now he's... It's okay, babe. You ever seen anything like this? Wamer, help me collect the samples. Yes, of course. Mother, I'm a doctor. I can help. Stay out of this. The rest of you stay put until I have some answers. Sounds good to me. Yeah, well, not to me. Your butler said something about a fog. Now, if this is an attack, we need to assess the threat and plan our exit. Well, if this was an attack, how do we know it wasn't you? Because he's a Reclamation Agent, Hank, and he came with me. Not exactly known for your judgement, P. You'd know, asshole. Language, Pawts. Enough. I have protected this family for over 20 years, young man. I know what to do. [dramatic music] What do you want to do? If it's a bio-attack, your mother's right about staying inside until we know more. I'm gonna put out a distress call. You go help her figure out what this is. Okay. ♪ ♪ Crazy girl. I'm gonna go over here now. I'm working. I know. Felt familiar. Here. You have to chip it. What do you mean, felt familiar? Just that I spent most of my childhood on the other side of your lab door. That's probably why I became a doctor. Well, don't blame me for that. Here, that's enough. Blame you? You know, most parents would be proud to have a doctor in the family. Most families aren't the Nine. And those who are have a duty to do more than treat tummy aches. Mother, one week ago, I was reattaching a leg to a four-year-old. You have no idea what I've had to do since the Company... our Company... bombed Old Town and put up that wall. I know what you were supposed to do for this family. You were supposed to lead, to make the hard decisions like I've had to every single day. I still can. I'm right here. You just have to let me in. [computer beeps] Processing complete. Pathogen detected. ♪ ♪ Wait. That doesn't make any sense. Approaching prisoner intake. Look, just tell me again, what did you see? Just images, like from someone else's eyes. A hand... something green. Green, like the sh1t Khlyen put into you in Arkyn? Yeah, exactly like that. Maybe Khlyen found a way to link your minds like he did to me with the neurolink. [sighs] Not exactly VI material. Agreed. If we gave him any more, we'd kill him. Well, at least we know Jaqobis' immunity to the plasma doesn't come from his father. Maybe it's maternal. Well, let's see if he knows where his mother is. I need to link with D'Avin again. If he's using you to spy on us, maybe we could use you to spy back. And how am I supposed to do that? I don't know. Push back. Improvise. Where's your mother, Jaqobis? What did you say about my mother? [humming noise] Dutch, it's happening again! [pulsating tone] sh1t! [all grunting] [tense music] ♪ ♪ What are you doing? Getting into Khlyen's head. You know, improvising! Well, maybe improvise after kicking Skeever ass. What's wrong? I'm connected. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ It's different this time. Ugh! Ahh! [panting] What the sh1t? [dramatic music] Dad? Pardon? ♪ ♪ Ahh! ♪ ♪ Ah! [grunts] ♪ ♪ It's you, isn't it? Hello, Yale. ♪ ♪ [groaning] Well, haven't felt that in a while. ♪ ♪ Oh, okay. Professional opinion: I do not like the look of that fog. Where's it coming from? ♪ ♪ We have staff in the boathouse. We need to go get them. Louella, we don't know what that is! Ooh, babe, listen to the Killjoy. Stop! ♪ ♪ [hissing] [gasps] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [cracking] Hank, help me here. Hank? Oh, sh1t. Hank bailed, and Louella's hurt! Johnny, it's some sort of pathogen. Yeah, whatever it is, it's on her hand. Get her to my lab. There's no time! It's headed up her arm. [gasps] Help me. What are you doing? [grunts] [shattering] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Here, I got her. What happened? I don't know, but it's in that fog, and it's coming right at us. Are you all right? Yep. As you were. Did you get anything else on Jaqobis? Yeah, I got, uh... what I needed. Which is? Which is all part of my plan, of course. Tell me what that plan is, specifically. ♪ ♪ Yeah, you're not buying any of this, are you? Not a bit, Jaqobis. [electricity crackling] I'm gonna go full Khlyen on your ass. [yells] [screaming] I am so strong. [zapping] Argh! Nice. We totally need one of these. [pants] Dad. You need to go, now. Dad! [moans] Dad! The fog is freezing everything out there. We're gonna freeze to death. We need to find a way out of here. [computer beeping] The only clear area right now is the roof. We can get a ship to pick us up from there. [wood cracks] Well, there's always more where this came from. Nice to be rich. Ha! I mean, I made it all. I was a carpenter once. Met Adaline when my family built her family's summer home. No offense, but I didn't think the Qreshi princesses married down. Her family threatened to disown her when they found out, but she won that fight, like she always does. And when she decided to kick Pawter out, you just what? Let her win that too? When you love two people equally, you have to make a choice. You choose the one that makes you a better man. Better? 'Cause where I'm from, only assholes kick their kids out, and I say that as a son of an asshole. You have no idea what this family has had to do or what was best for my daughter. [computer beeps] Why can't I plot an exit from the roof? What's blocking us? An alpha shield? You have an alpha shield? Yeah. What's an alpha shield? What's a... it's a high-resonance energy barrier permeable only by light and oxygen. It's the ultimate containment device. When you have as many enemies as my wife does... No, no, no, no, no, no. It doesn't keep enemies out. It keeps things in... like, say, a pathogen from the lab. [tense music] I got to get this shield down now. [engines roaring] ♪ ♪ How are you even here? The plasma acts as a conduit between connected minds, among other things. Dutch, I'm reading massive trauma to D'Avin's lower left abdomen. You're hurt. No, Jaqobis is hurt. I need to send a message to my partner to switch us back before certain... people catch up to him... me. It's confusing. D'Avin can take care of himself. Not against the Black Root. If they catch up to him first, we'll both be dead. If I didn't know better, I'd think these Black Root people scare you. Actually, they report to me, normally. What about an FLT transmission? What are the protocols on this vessel? Faster-than-light communication is impossible. With your technology, maybe. You're welcome to step outside and find some other technology. [snapping] [groaning] Thank you. I haven't felt that much pain in a while. It's chilly. I'm not gonna let D'Av's body die because you don't care about him. On the contrary, Yale, I care about him very much. That's why I'm here. So when exactly were you gonna mention the alpha shield? I'm working. You know, before I die, I usually like to know what's gonna kill me. Don't touch me. [dramatic music] Your neck. How'd the house let the fog get in? I infected myself. What? I had a cure I thought I might try. Seems it didn't take. You created the pathogen, didn't you? Oh, good. At least you're clever. I was worried about Illenore's taste after Hank. Lady, you are a real piece of work. What was this, a field test? Why did you release it? Oh, I didn't release it. This is an attack, a message. Someone stole my work to use against my family. No one is coming to help us, but the alpha shield will keep it in. Oh, so your fog can kill us all in the process? I have a plan. I have one too. It involves blowing the sh1t out of your shield's power source. No power, no shield, and we all get out of here. If the pathogen escapes... No, I have done the math. We are 186 miles from the closest land mass. The water and the air will disperse it. No, it won't. It will replicate at an exponential rate, freeze the water, and kill everything it touches. Mother, what did you make? Pawter. I have to stop that bomb. Go. ♪ ♪ That was quick thinking with your sister. You saved her life. Why did I have to? Why are you doing this? Same reason we do everything... for Qresh. Our planet, our people... all of it is under a ticking clock. Some of the Nine families embrace our fate; others resist it. This was my attempt to stop it. By killing everyone with a horrible disease? By making this planet uninhabitable for those who choose to take it. You're not making any sense. All that matters is that I failed. The pathogen was meant to freeze land and water. My formula was off. I can't fix it. I don't care about any of that. You have to... just let me help you, please. I've linked myself to the bio-scan. I'm leaving you with a full record of what it does to a human subject. Use the science. Help the others. You didn't have to do this. Yes, I did. This is what it takes to head the family... what your father never wanted for you. To protect what you love, you must become something you hate. [somber music] ♪ ♪ [laughing] Pawter, I did it. Pawter? You need to be with your family. [somber music] No. She's gone now. I'm the only one who can do this. Do what? What I would really like to do right now is get as drunk as possible, but that's Qreshi Pawter. ♪ ♪ Old Town Pawter needs to fix this. I'm a big fan of that one. ♪ ♪ Then I better start studying what my mother left me. [groaning] You know, the novelty of pain is starting to wear off by now. Why you so interested in D'Avin? He can resist the plasma. I need to know how. Plasma, the green sh1t you pumped into him in Arkyn. What is it? A beginning, the end, depending on where you stand. Right now, I'm standing opposite you with surgical staples. Be a bit more explain-y. I had plans for you, Yale. And then your D'Avin comes along and changes the rules, makes the impossible possible. Do you know what that's like? What are these careful plans? Why won't you tell me? 'Cause you always think you know what's best, Yale. Everything is balanced on the sharpest of edges. You would charge in blind and destroy that. I wouldn't. Of course you would. You can't change who you are. [grunting] Dutch, D'Avin is in critical condition. But I closed the wound. It's not the wound; it's the connection. Jaqobis' body isn't prepared. I need to switch back now. Okay, good. Go. How? I have no idea. Dad! You need to get someplace safe with people you trust. Ron Kessel, Winnis Gall... any of those guys still around? What the hells do you know? Gall's dead. Kessel's off-world. All right, well, someplace hidden, like... There was a cave by Lake Rounder. You made me sleep there that whole summer to toughen me up. It was dark. It was hidden. D'Avin? [grunts] Oh, sh1t. [zapping] [groaning] You know that's not gonna keep working, right? This asshole is tough. You came back. I... I don't know how, but... We have to go. We have to go! No! I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did, for making you go. Dad... For making you scared of me. Scared? Listen to me, you son of a bitch. I left because I knew if I spent one more night, I was gonna kill you. Now go! Why are you saving me now? Because I'm not you. Go! Get! [grunts] You can't have him. I don't want him. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [electricity crackling] [sighs] Poor Mom. Poor Hank. Dad, Johnny and I have an idea. According to the readouts from Mom, the pathogen is a mutant hybrid of about ten types. Well, your mother was always very good with viruses. But the core one, I recognize: Keltric 0-9. I treated it on a mining colony. It has one vulnerability: extreme heat. We just have to figure out how to burn everything without killing everyone. Johnny has a plan. [engines roaring] So are things good with you? Oh, you know, family reunions. Right, sure. So hypothetical question: say two consciousnesses were switched. Any idea how you might switch them back? Uh, well, brains are just chemistry and electricity. If you had a big enough jump-start, Is everything okay? Perfect. And that could work. Hypothetically. Well, since we're talking in hypotheticals, how much explosives would it take to, say, set off 20, 30 gas lines? Uh, so long as you start the main line, you shouldn't need much more than a directional charge. Johnny, if you need help... You'd fly right over, I know,  even if you had enough trouble of your own. Come home safe. You too. [electronic chime] Okay. I think this is the only way. Wamer, where are the gas mains? A control building, just past the main wall. [laughs] So right through the fog. Johnny, you can't. If it means that you all live, yes, I can. No, if we can't protect you from the fog, I won't let you. Our diving suit... Look, if I can do this fast enough, then I can get off planet, and we can get treated. You saw how fast it moves, and there is no antidote. Hello? Diving suit? For God's sake, Louella, this is serious! So am I! You need to protect yourself with something nonporous that can cover your entire body and can withstand extreme cold,  something like the diving suit. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Air purity 90%. ♪ ♪ [thud] ♪ ♪ You just couldn't stay out of things that don't concern you, huh, big guy? [Johnny panting] So blow this thing, set off a big chain reaction, burn the fog right out of the air, huh? Yeah, something like that. [shattering] We let the fog finish out the fam inside, then we bolt, and then we split the joy 50-50. And I won't have to explain a dead Killjoy along with the Simms family popsicles inside. [laughing] You really are a massive dick-hole. You know that? Careful, you might hurt my feelings. So what's it gonna be? She was giving me orders till the very end. Never even said, "I love you." I don't know. I think giving orders was Mommy's way of saying, "I love you." He should be back by now. I'm going out there. What? Daddy, no, the fog! Johnny will do it. If something is wrong, we all die. Then let me go! No. Daddy, please stay. No. No, you both need to stay. You are the family now. No, Dad, I can't. Please don't go. Yes, you can. Sometimes we have choices, and sometimes we don't. Just hope this works. Well, if it doesn't, Jaqobis will be too dead to complain about it.

It was there all along. Lucy, show me D'Avin's neural readout. Who operated on Jaqobis' brain? The army. What does that change? Hopefully everything. ♪ ♪ I sent one last transmission from Red 17.
