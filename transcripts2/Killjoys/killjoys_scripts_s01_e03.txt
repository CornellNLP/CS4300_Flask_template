 Previously on  Killjoys... 
 From the time you receive the box, you'll have one week to assassinate the target. 
 Khlyen wants you dead, and I want to know why. 
 (cheering) 
 Why did you come to the Quad, D'avin? 
 I'm looking for someone. A doctor. 
 You have to protect him. He's family. 
 So are you. 
 I'll take your advice and find work. 
 Algae farm night watchman. 
 Another option. 
 Killjoy. 
 Dutch should be here. This is important. 
 Knock it off. 
 What? 
 Your leg. 
 You're nervous. Stop. 
 You should be nervous! 
 (sighing) 
 I just want you to know that if you do pass, I'm gonna be a cool boss. 
 One more word, I'll choke you to sleep. 
 That's a little aggressive. 
 (door buzzing) 
 John Jaqobis. Sponsoring agent. 
 Keera Deen. Don't give a sh1t. Heard all about your tech exam. 
 Set a course record. 
 I like to be thorough. 
 We get a lot of ex-military, most of them wash out. 
 They can't take the independent thought we require from agents. 
 Convince me you're different. 
 Why do you want to be a Killjoy? 
 Um... I believe in what the Rack stands for... 
 No. 
 Don't care. Try again. 
 My team is excellent and I think that... 
 Strike two. 
 Tell ya what, hero, you get back to me when you figure it out. 
 I don't fit in anywhere else. 
 I'm not cut out to be a civilian and I'm done being a soldier. 
 I'm not good at a lot of things. But I'm good at that. 
 And I would be good for the Rack. 
 OK. Fist to heart. 
 D'avin Jaqobis, as of now, you are nobody's citizen, nobody's soldier. 
 You renounce all loyalties except these: our code, your team, and the warrant. How do you swear? 
 I will take no sides, take no bribes. 
 The warrant is all. 
 (choking up): I swore that I wouldn't cry. 
 Welcome to the family. Take him to celebrate. 
 You've been cleared for level four. 
 Whoa, whoa, wait, wait... level four? 
 Do I outrank you? 
 You can grab your badge at Supply just as soon as you pass your psych eval. 
 Say that again? 
 Come on. Let's go find Dutch. 
 (crying) 
 Hello, darling. 
 (door closing) 
 I'm back with treats. 
 It's been days, you must be parched. 
 (moaning) 
 Let's try this again. 
 Why does Khlyen want you dead and how do I find him? 
 I don't know. 
 Wrong answer. 
 Please... 
 ♪ He keeps chasing me, Mama ♪ 
♪ He keeps chasing me, Mama ♪ 
 You have two options: keep your secrets or keep your life. 
 I don't know any Khlyen! 
 Please, don't do this. Please. 
 I'm telling you the truth. You know I am. 
 If you're not, you'll wish your death had been this easy. 
 (slicing ropes) 
 Now run. 
 Somewhere no one can find you. 
 ♪ Ooh, just wanna feel good ♪ 
♪ Come, come, come uninvited ♪ 
♪ Run, run, run 'til I find ya ♪ 
♪ I don't care which side that you're fighting ♪ 
♪ Gonna get you gone ♪ 
 If you're level three... how do I outrank you already? 
 The Rack works in mysterious ways. 
 Wait, can you even kill people? 
 Of course I can kill people! 
 ...When accompanied by a level four or higher. 
 (laughing) 
 Oof, that's a lotta jakk! 
 (spraying) 
 Yeah, easier just to burn it, no? 
 Sure. If you wanted to knock out half of Old Town. 
 The stuff's toxic, not to mention extremely flammable. 
 Hey, so what's the deal with this psych eval I gotta get? 
 Any tips? 
 I dunno. Don't be crazy? 
 man : Go back to the farm, jakkholes! 
 (people shouting) 
 You know how Pree gives us all those free drinks? 
 Yeah... 
 Nothing's free on this moon. Come on. 
 (loud rock music playing) 
 (grunting) 
 This little arrangement that we have is becoming less charming. 
 My best hokk. 
 Should dull the pain. 
 You wanna tag in? 
 (grunting) 
 Nah, he's good. He's level four. 
 You really need to close shop during Harvest Week. 
 Oh, please. Migrants all come back from Leith loaded with Joy, and if they're buying, you know I'm pouring. 
 woman : Hey! 
 (groaning) 
 Hi. 
 So the best part about being as drunk as I am right now... 
 Is that you won't remember any of this in the morning? 
 Oh... 
 I'm gonna want to remember this. 
 Excuse me. Is that the guy that threw you? 
 Yep, he owes me a new drink. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 (choking) 
 OK, I think he learned his lesson! 
 D'avin! D'av! That's enough! 
 (gunshot) 
 (crowd yelping) 
 I have a headache, a badge, and a gun. 
 Behave. 
 Hey, where have you been? 
 Hey. 
 OK... Sexers are offering 20 per cent off upstairs. Harvest special! 
 You're bleeding. 
 I'm celebrating. 
 Level four. Watch out, I'm catching up. 
 You pass your psych eval yet? 
 Go see Pawter. 
 She runs a clinic out of a room upstairs. See if she'll rubber stamp you. 
 She's your doctor? Seriously? 
 We can't take you on missions until you clear your psych. 
 It's just... 
 D'avin's like a comet, you know? 
 Mm, right, comet. 
 Mm-hmm... 
 Me, I'm uh... 
 I'm more like dark matter. 
 (unbuttoning) 
 I'm stable. I hold things together. 
 John, if you just wanna talk... 
 I know, you charge the same amount... that's cool. 
 So where was I... 
 If you want to talk, there's something I'd like to discuss, too. 
 It's Vincent. My husband. 
 So what's going on? 
 He spends half the year on Leith. 
 He goes to plant hokk and comes back before Harvest. But this year he hasn't. 
 So maybe he decided to stay on and earn some extra Joy. 
 I haven't heard from him. 
 Nobody has. 
 So he just disappeared? 
 His visa expires in two days. 
 If Vincent's not back by then, the penalty is ten years of hard labour. 
 I co-signed the work visa. If they can't find him... 
 ...His sentence is automatically transferred to you. Oh, N'oa... 
 You have to find him. 
 I put out a warrant on him and I want you to take it. 
 You know I love you, Johnny, but nope. No way. 
 Oh, come on, it's a legitimate warrant and a favour for a friend. It's a win-win! 
 Unless you fail-fail. 
 Also, stop being friends with everyone you sleep with, it's just weird. 
 Hey, if the thought of poor sweet N'oa dying a slow death in the yttrium mines doesn't bother you... 
 (coughing exaggeratedly) 
 Oh, please. 
 The Company makes examples of illegal exiles. You know it. 
 Where is the target? 
 On Leith, during Harvest Fest! 
 So we grab Vincent, make some Joy, blow it all on pumpkin beer and grackle, all while we soak up the sun. 
 Did I mention that we're gonna be going undercover? 
 You love undercover! 
 (chuckling) 
 (wincing) 
 Ouch. What's with the burn? 
 Nothing. Stupid accident. Why are you so keen on this warrant? 
 Just... I want us both to get away and have some fun. 
 You know, before D'avin joins the team. And besides, you have seemed a little tense lately. 
 What the hell! 
 I wouldn't mind being someone else for a while. 
 But I get to choose our covers. 
 That never goes well for me. 
 (Dutch chuckles) 
 (loud electronic music playing) 
 D'avin : So you sobered up fast. 
 Ancient Doctor's secret. We have all the best pills. 
 (buzzing) 
 So, you kind of lost it out there. Do you always fight with such intensity? 
 When I get angry enough. 
 I didn't get this from the fight, though. 
 I got it acing the Killjoy test. 
 If you're the pass, I'd hate to see the fail. 
 Oh, my eyes are fine. 
 Even Killjoys get concussions. 
 I'm fine. 
 Besides, I'm not a full Killjoy, yet. 
 I still need to pass my psych eval, and was hoping you could sign it for me. 
 Oh... 
 You need a Rack-certified doctor and I'm the only one around for miles. 
 OK. What's in it for me? 
 Well I could... buy you dinner? 
 (laughing): Wow. That sounded totally sincere, thank you. How about this: your partners are heading to Leith. Get me a seat on Lucy when they do. 
 Why do you need my help for that? 
 Because Dutch doesn't like me and she'll say no if I ask. 
 Get me a ride, help me pick up supplies at the bazaar and I will sign that psych eval for you when we're back. 
 Deal? 
 I'll talk to John, make it happen. 
 Good. 
 Do you want some, uh, pain meds for your head? 
 Actually, you got any, um, Copazenol? 
 It helps me sleep. 
 I'm all out. 
 man : Alright, new pickers, welcome to the farm. 
 Behave yourselves, work hard... 
 second man : Right there. 
 ...you'll leave here with a year's worth of Joy. 
 Move it up. Next! 
 What is that? 
 It's insurance, so you're not tempted to overstay your visa. 
 (whirring and clunking) 
 Move. Next! 
 You work sun up to sun down. No excuses. 
 So Johnny got himself in as a migrant worker, should be settled  on Martell's farm by now. 
 "Should be"? 
 Farm rules. 
 Data blackout for all migrants, so he deactivated his com. 
 Well, I looked into this Martell fella's shop, looks clean. 
 No workers AWOL for 6 seasons, but a whole lot of "farm accidents" and "work-related deaths". 
 Enh, probably self-inflicted. I'd kill myself if I had to farm all day. 
 The cover you wanted. 
 Won't stand up to much poking around, but this warrant ain't worth my extra effort. 
 You sure it's worth yours? 
 Seems to mean a lot to Johnny. 
 - Why? 
 Ever since his brother showed up, John's been off his game. He needs a win. So, John's looking low and I'll be looking high as a hokk distributor working for The Nine. My Lady. Bedros Martell. It's an honour to have you as a guest at my humble hokkery. Not too humble, I hope, or I'm wasting my time. We only import the best. I've prepared my finest room for you. If there's anything I can do to make your stay more pleasurable... Fetch my luggage. That would be a good start. You OK? This moon's just too damn hot. Take it easy. Hey, Westy. Fresh off the transport, huh? How'd you know? They don't pay us to "take it easy". Yeah, well, I had a drinking buddy in Old Town that told me this was the farm to crew if I ever wanted an easy job and fresh air. You know Vincent Sh'ao? 'Cause I could really kick his ass right about now. They don't pay us to talk, either. (groaning) Hey! Get up or we'll dock a day's wages! He needs water. Easy, easy, easy. Got ourselves a runner! Activate the tracker! (bang) (choking yell) John : What the hells? New people, pay attention! That is the kind of accident that happens when you break your work permit. Stay in the zone. Now get back to work! What about "under cover", didn't you understand? Calm down, I was careful. Wow! Nice. You definitely got the better gig. Oh, gross! Please get off my bed. They make us sleep on hokk leaves. Who does that? John, you smell like Lucy's septic system and that is 3000 count Qreshi delta linen, so get off my bed. (sighing) Tell me what you've found. Not Vincent, but I did discover Martell's innovative worker retention program. They jam one of these puppies into us. What's that? Ow! It's an incendiary tracking device. They remove it on the transport home, but until then, step out of the designated zone and... (making explosion noise) That's great news. That I have a tracking bomb in my ear? Thanks. That Vince has. Can you get into whatever system Martell tracks his migrants with? Why do you think I'm here? To ruin my bed and steal my bonbons? You know you're just role-playing a Qreshi bitch, Dutch; you don't have to be one. (beeping) Can't get access. It's eye scan only. Then I'll get us an eye. Not literally. Meet me tonight. I need a minimum 50 doses, but I'll take more if you're feeling generous. Sorry, I can't help you. I'm just an herbalist. Come on. We both know you sell more than just herbs. You want Linaria root? I can sell you that. Please. I'm losing 10 children a month to Pleuroxis. I need your help. Ask me, the best thing for the Quad is fewer Westerlyns. Come on. We'll get it somewhere else. AHH! You heard of Selius Fever? It's nasty stuff. Pawter! You want the inoculation? Let's trade. Nice try. Get the doctor what she wants. Slowly. Not a word. Do it. Here, this'll cleanse your palate. Where did you get that? The big house. You went inside? Yeah, why should they get all the fancy stuff? (laughing) I haven't had real cocoa since I was a child. Thank you. So, what brings you to Leith? Like I said: sun, fresh air, Joy. The usual. You're not exactly the usual. I'm not? No. You're either really brave or really dumb. Well, I don't want to live in a world where I have to choose. Seriously, why leave? I came to the Quad on a stolen ship with nothing in my pockets. The only place that would take me was Westerley, but I hate living there and I definitely don't wanna die there. You're thinking of running? Not after what I saw today. Good. Running never works. Is that what happened to Vince? He tried to run and now he's fertilizing the hokk? Well, if you know Vincent, you'd know he's smarter than that. Does your family have much land left? On Qresh? By the time my father was of age, most of it had submerged. He was the youngest, so he got a one-way trip to Leith and a parcel of land. Which now produces some of the finest hokk in the Quad. My investors are very interested in importing if they like what I see. Our hokk recipe is my invention, and I've dealt with my share of swindlers and spies along the way... many thinking themselves quite clever. But there's one thing cleverness can't get you... taste. Mm. We'll start with a young shiro. Peppery, with hints of citrus. And if I'm not mistaken... vanilla. But this shiro's been aged at least two years. Two years, three months. Your palate is refined, Seyah. As is my generous host. I'd never know you for a Leithian. Shall we try a vintage gorudo? And waste a perfectly good bottle? You're touching me. Trust me. We'll have more fun drinking this. 
 
 Permission to touch you, my lady? Granted. Permission to take your clothes off? That's quite the burn. That? It's nothing. And what about these bruises? Are they "nothing"? What highborn Qreshi woman has these scars? Feel that? That's from being tied with bansa knots. And this, this is from a long night and an even longer whip. We of the Nine like to play rough. How rough? (grunting) How much can you take, you dirty Leithian? More. I've always wanted to make a high-born woman scream. Have you ever experienced a Qreshi Two-Hander? Show me. Close your eyes. Sweet dreams. Welcome back, Bedros Martell. Track me Vincent Sh'ao. Tether it to my guest's personal device. (beeping) Got you. (groaning) Log out. Shut down. (beeping) You became overstimulated. It happens the first time. Uh, wait, did we finish? Thank you for a very enjoyable evening. Was I good? (sighing) Relax! She can't report us. Do you have any idea what the penalty is for selling black-market meds? And do you have any idea what the penalty is for armed robbery and assault with a deadly pathogen? That was water! You think I'm crazy? A little, yeah. I've been told that by saner men than you, D'avin Jaqobis. You knew you were gonna rob her. You used me. Oh right, like you haven't been playing me? "I can buy you dinner. Oh, look at my manly muscles. Please sign my psych form." Alright, alright. Guilty. Look, I really did need those meds, OK? Pleuroxis was barely a cold when I grew up on Qresh. On Westerley it's a death sentence because no one can afford the damn pills. Not OK. So what took you to Westerley? Need. As soon as people heard there's a doctor around, they started lining up and they haven't stopped since. Westerlyns get a raw deal in the Quad. I try and balance it when I can. Your turn. Why are you here? (fireworks whistling) Midnight celebration. Harvest tradition. (people cheering) (fireworks crackling) Yeah, we should head back to Lucy. No, watch. (fireworks mingling with explosions) D'avin. It's OK. Alright, Vincent. Come out, come out, wherever you are. (device beeping) Oh, damn. Well this just got... creepy. What do you think? Workers chopping and running or serial killer with an ear fetish? Either way, why hasn't Martell reported them missing? (people chatting) Whatever it is, all breadcrumbs lead to that forest outside the security zone. Agreed. I'll call D'avin in for back up, go with him at first light. D'avin? Seriously? I'm literally standing right here. Your head will literally go boom if you leave the grounds. D'avin's standing by at the Leith market. Fine. But I got in tight with this migrant worker, Shyla; I think she knows what's going on, so just give me a day to work that angle, get some intel... No. I'm sorry, are you not letting me? Again, John: bomb in your head. I don't want you painting an unnecessary target on yourself. D'avin and I will handle it and that's final. Whatever you say, boss. Johnny, don't be a sh1t. D'avin Jaqobis. Fearless, decisive, has what it takes to be a Killjoy. He's also hyper-violent. Has trouble sleeping. Occasionally cannot to distinguish between civilian life and battle. My diagnosis: stress response syndrome. You triggered me on purpose? I'm sorry. I was doing my job. The signs were there, I just needed to be sure. Wanna know what I've observed? Illenore Pawter Simms. Messiah complex. Fraud. You're on Westerley the same reason as the rest of us: 'cause you have nowhere to go. Nice. But you can't drive me away that easy. The Company threatened to suspend your medical license unless you left Qresh. Banishment? Damn, Doc! What'd you do? Where'd you hear that? Killjoys have access to all kinds of fun files. Just doing my job. Like you said, you're not a Killjoy... not until I sign off on you. I'll find my own ride home. Hey, "Brave and Dumb", still enjoying the fresh air? Actually, I just came to say goodbye. What? Harvesting hokk isn't for me. We're not slaves. I can quit if I want, as long as I go straight back to Westerley. Yeah, and they can make sure you don't see a single Joy and that you pay for the transport back out of your own pocket or lock you up for the debt. Is that what you want? OK, truth. I didn't come here to pick hokk. Now, Vince said there was more to this place. If he lied, then I'm gone. But if not, I want in. Why are you telling me? Because I know that you're involved. Now, whatever it is, I'm ready for it. One-way ride. You do this, there's no coming back. (humming) So just how brave and dumb are you? (exhaling) Incoming call from Dutch. Go ahead, Dutch. Has John been in touch? No. Why? I wanted to apologize about something this morning, couldn't find him. And none of the other workers have seen him. (device beeping) I'm tracking his ear tag. What's he done now? Oh, no! Oh, Johnny Jaqobis, tell me you didn't! So I came to Leith, prepared to work myself into an early grave. Then I met Vincent, and he showed me a new way. So you go back and forth between the farm and the forest? To find other Westerlyns who refuse to be defined by the world they were born on or assigned to. People who have what it takes. To do what? Follow me. Crazy, ear-chopping son of a bitch! Lucy, ready engines. Engines ready. Dutch, I'm coming in hot  and leveling the forest until we find him. Easy, soldier. Stay ready, but leave it with me. (doors opening and footsteps approaching) You might want to put those down. And you might want to tell me who the hell you really are. Most hokk distributors I know don't pack this kind of weapon. Who are you with? Killjoy. On an official warrant. Well, I guess the migrant worker that broke in here and attacked you was too stupid to know any better. Pity about the blood on my nice rugs. Do it. man : Hey! (grunting) I don't have time for this. (groaning) OW! (cracking) How about your rug, your blood? (groaning) What do you want? I wanted a holiday. I have a lot I'm dealing with right now, so unless you want me to vent my frustration by frying the crap outta you, tell me: where's my partner? Everyone, meet John, our new friend. You brought me to a jakk grow-op? Where's John? I have no idea what the hell you're talking about. (buzzing) (groaning) Did that help? He went looking for Vincent Sh'ao. Vincent's not here. He's out in the woods. Doing what? Running a jakk grow-op. Where's the grow-op? I can tell you, but you don't want to go there. And why's that? When you hacked my system, I thought you were here to bust me, so I contacted the authorities and expressed my absolute shock at finding a jakk grow-op running under my nose. Plausible deniability, nice. How long do I have? Before the defoliation ships arrive? In an hour that forest will be a dead zone. And if he's out there, your partner will be, too. That him? Yeah, he says he knows you. Oh really? Look, I can explain. (grunting) Look, I'm just here to bring you home. I am home. Here's the danger in telling lies: someone always knows the truth. So unless you want a bullet to the head, "old drinking buddy", you're gonna tell me who you are. I'm a Killjoy. I've got a warrant to take you back to Westerley before your visa expires. That is all. Who put out the warrant? N'oa. His wife. You remember her? I didn't know she cared so much. She kinda has to. She co-signed your work-contract. If you go AWOL, she does your time... and I'm not gonna let that happen. Yeah, well, I'm not going back to Westerley. N'oa should have made better choices. Now I gotta get rid of you. You really don't want to do that. The Rack will hunt you down. The Rack? By the time they find your body, I'll be long gone. You brought him in, you put him down. Let's go. Get up. UP! Get here, D'avin. Get here now. Hang in. Almost there. I'm sorry, John. I really am. You really should be. (choking cough) Don't move. I'm going after Vincent. In range for landing. Good. Locate Dutch's position and bring us down as close as you can. (high-pitched beeping) I don't know all your beeps yet, Lucy, what does that mean? Congested airfield. There are other ships heading to our destination. Oh, that's not good. John! Hey, Dutch. So where's D'avin? What the hell happened here? John Jaqobis happened. OK, you're amazing. We need to go, now. (echoing boom) What's that sound? Defoliation ships. Martell ratted out the operation to the authorities. OK, I'm ready. You can take me home. No! We stay and fight. We'll shoot at their ships, drive them off. Buy enough time to save the crop. If you stay, you die. Come with us. Back to Old Town? Prison? Go to hell. I fight for what's mine. You got a warrant for me, not her. Take me. He's right, John. If she wants to stay, that's her choice. Have it your way. Keep up Vincent! Those ships are dropping payload, you got about 10 seconds. Hustle! 10, 9... (high-pitched beeping) John : D'av, we can count! Vince, haul your ass! Toxin dispersal ship approaching. Get in. Come on. (groaning) Come on. (ship whirring) Congratulations, I'm back on Westerley. Your warrant's complete. You, uh, wanna get rid of these things? Thank you so much for the ride. John, your guest has arrived. Much appreciated. Vincent? N'oa, baby! That was so close. I missed you! Did you miss me? Are you kidding me? I thought about you every night! I owe you my life. I hope you think about me every night for the next 10 years, you pathetic, wannabe, planet-hopping ass! I like her. He's all yours, Johnny. Baby, wait... Vincent Sh'ao, it gives me... Well, let's be honest... great pleasure to inform you that you are so locked and incredibly served. This is horseshit. Your warrant was to bring me back here, and I'm here! Unfortunately, your off-world permit expired an hour outside of Westerlyn airspace. Johnny, did we take the scenic route? We did, and I feel terrible about that. The Company's charged you with illegal emigration, issued a new warrant even before we landed, jakkhole. So have fun serving your time at the bottom of a mine. You should have made better choices. You ask me, it looks a little large... I'd shut up before she takes off your other ear. It's gonna be a while before I can fit you in, so if I were you I would go get really, really, really drunk. This is gonna hurt, isn't it? (whispering): Yeah. Well... I'll come find you when I'm ready. (device beeping) I know I'm supposed to say something to make things better. Say you're sorry. You could start with that. I'm sorry. And for the record, I don't care why you left Qresh. It's none of my business. Do you like living this way? No. Then do something about it. D'avin, you don't add up. You're taking Copazenol, you say to help you sleep, but Copazenol is a very strong neurological medication. Who prescribed it to you? Some army doc. What was she treating you for? Honestly, can't remember. Read it. You're passing me? Because we had a deal and I keep my word. Look, if you care at all about yourself or your team, you need to get help. Stress response syndrome doesn't just go away, it takes treatment, and... OK. OK? Yeah. What about you? Can you treat me? Why? I don't like most doctors. I like you. What's in it for me? Pumpkin beers. Pree saved us a couple. Disobeying orders, cutting off your ear... what's going on with you, Jaqobis? You first. Strange red box, mystery burns, asking D'avin to join our team without asking me first? He's your brother, I thought you'd be happy. Of course I'm happy! So then what's the problem? It's... it's complicated. For once... ...I had something that I was amazing at, I had a partner that I loved working with. And then he just comes in, he starts D'avin-ing all over it. They started him at a level four. I'm allowed to be conflicted for a day. His level four is nothing compared to the six years we've had each other's backs. If you're worried about being replaced, don't be. You're... ...irreplaceable to me. (chuckling) Thank you. I like when you use your words. Look, if you ever want him gone, he's gone. You can't make your brother-crap our crap. I know. You have to deal with that. I will. Soon. Because... he'll probably just leave again, once he finds that doctor he's tracking. (sighing) Now you gonna tell me what's been going on with you? If I tell you it's over, can we let that be enough? OK. But no more secrets. No more secrets. Tap my heart. Good. (exhaling) Now... If you'll excuse me, I have to go see a girl about an ear.
