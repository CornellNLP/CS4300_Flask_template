 [coughs] 
 Alvis. 
 Welcome to Spring Hill, a little Company bio-dome I had set up outside Old Town. 
 Illenor Seyah Simms. 
 It's an honor. 
 She's a guest of the Company now. 
 If you need me, we're there. 
 Where are your saviors now? 
 No! 
 [swords clashing] 
 What are you? 
 I'm Level VI. 
 [gasps] 
 [screams] 
 Turin, what the hells do you want? 
 I want you to take some unofficial assignments. 
 Let's call 'em unsanctioned warrants. 
 So this is the deal. 
 You use me; I use you. 
 Because until we know what Khlyen's endgame is, we're all being used. 
 [water dripping] 
 [ambient music] 
 [over radio, breaking up] Dutch? 
 Dutch, can you hear me? 
 [rock tumbles] 
 [dramatic sting] 
 Why are you here? 
 That's not the question, little bird. 
 The question is why are you here? 
 It's time for you to come back to Arkyn. 
 Is that what you wanted? 
 To shove a spike in my neck and pump me full of green sh1t until I turn into a cold, bloodless thing like you? 
 Poor Yala, you really don't remember, do you? 
 Remember what? 
 That it's already been done. 
 You're a VI, Yala. 
 No! 
 Well, I can show you. 
 [knife slashes] 
 [gasps] 
 [groaning] 
 Okay, you got us here. What's the mission? 
 About a week ago, three of our own got downed, north end of the Badlands, running ahead of a Black Rain storm. 
 It's Paolo. 
 You know him? 
 I've heard of him. 
 Works with his wife, Tanya? 
 They took on her sister, Deena. 
 Were they on a warrant? 
 Level II, salvage. 
 Everything else about it is sealed. 
 Northern Badlands, that's just... that's wasteland. 
 There's nothing out there to salvage. 
 Gets weirder. 
 When the team called in an evac, Khlyen intercepted the message, covered it up. 
 No rescue team was sent. 
 I want to know whether our people are still alive. 
 If they are, bring them home. 
 And find out what Khlyen is trying to cover up. 
 Coordinates are on there. 
 Now, get the hell out of here and forget you ever saw this place. 
 I got to see a lake about a fish. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Try not to screw this up. 
 Such a dick.

 Hey, Lucy, anything from above? 
 I've located the ship. 
 Sending coordinates. 
 Oh. That's a big'un. 
 [engine slows, stops] 
 Anything yet? 
 I've been hailing, but they're not answering. 
 There's nothing showing on infrared. 
 As far as I can see, they're not in there. 
 Yeah, but why would they leave their ship? 
 There's nothing for a thousand clicks in any direction. 
 And it'd been safer inside. 
 Looks like the ramp's jammed. 
 [strains] 
 Come on. 
 [both strain] 
 [lock hisses] 
 [metal creaks] 
 [ominous tone] 
 I do not like what they've done with the place. 
 What is this sh1t? 
 Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it's moss. 
 In a ship? In the desert? 
 They called in for an evac a week ago. 
 Where does this stuff come from, Johnny? 
 How could it grow so fast? 
 Seriously, what do you guys think, that I'm a mossologist? 
 Must've gotten wet in here. 
 The electronics are shorted out. 
 Can't get past the damn air lock. 
 Yeah. Means the comms and controls are down. 
 She's grounded. 
 Well, if they're not here, where are they? 
 Let's go find out.

 Initiating aerial spiral search pattern. 
 You're the best. 
 I haven't found any topographical anomalies large enough for human shelter yet. 
 But I did a fascinating soil sample analysis. 
 Would you like to hear it? 
 Oh, thanks, Lucy, but I'll save that for bedtime.

 Fine. Connecting to Spring Hill.

 Laundry day finally come? 
 Found it in D'avin's room while I was going through his stuff. 
 [door hisses] 
 If you really want to piss him off, I could hire you. 
 Is that an offer? 
 'Cause I could use the work. 
 You're not serious? 
 Wait, this isn't about what happened under Spring Hill? 
 Alvis, you can't be thinking about leaving the Scarbacks. 
 The faith has always been everything to you. 
 The faith almost turned me into a mass murderer. 
 Oh, that wasn't faith; that was hate. 
 Trust me, I'm familiar with the difference. 
 Really? 
 What do you have faith in? 
 The RAC? 
 I'm the wrong person for you to talk to.

 Alvis? 
 Yep. 
 Any idea how long he's gonna be with us? 
 Just wondering if we're gonna be setting up a confessional in the mess area or anything. 
 Don't want to see him cutting himself before I've had my morning coffee. 
 We smuggled him out of Old Town so until he finds someplace else to go, we're responsible for him. 
 Ah, so that's what we're feeling. 
 Responsibility. 
 [gun fires] 
 [shot ricochets] 
 Hostiles! 
 Wait. 
 [guns cock] 
 We're on a warrant! 
 Hands up, weapons down! 
 So you're here to save us or kill us? 
 You're Tanya, right? 
 Maybe. 
 Depends on who's asking. 
 I'm Dutch. 
 And we're RAC Agents, answering your call for evac. 
 We sent that call a week ago. 
 What does the name Khlyen mean to you? 
 [tense music] 
 He's a RAC officer; he's the one that cancelled your rescue. 
 We want to know why. 
 Tell me why I should trust you. 
 Because you were doing your job. 
 And the people who were supposed to be protecting you betrayed you. 
 We've been there, too. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 We think you stumbled over something you shouldn't have seen. 
 Are we right? 
 If I tell you, will you come down with me to get Deena? 
 Down where? 
 Into the mine. 
 [sighs] 
 What mine? 
 This one. 
 [water dripping] 
 We're gonna need Alvis. 
 What's all the shiny sh1t? 
 The photonic crystals. 
 They absorb the light. 
 [echoes] 
 You guys have some nice toys. 
 Comes with the job. 
 Like sexy jackets and early death. 
 Okay, we're here so tell us what happened. 
 What were you sent to salvage? 
 A monk. 
 How do you salvage a person? 
 Didn't make any sense to us either, but it's triple scale. 
 I searched the Company records on the way here. 
 There's nothing in 'em about a mine in this area. 
 The warrant came with coordinates and they were right. 
 You're here, aren't you? 
 [tense music] 
 Mm. Touchy. 
 Any thoughts on the monk angle? 
 All I can say is that the faith grew up in the mines. 
 That's how I ended up taking the ropes. 
 You were a miner? 
 It's why he's with us, D'av. 
 Here I thought it was Bring a Monk To Work Day. 
 Is that my shirt? 
 [scoffs] 
 Is it? 
 So how did you guys end up down here? 
 We were emptying the Recu when the Black Rain started so we had no choice. 
 Called in the evac and we went underground. 
 Then our batteries ran out. 
 A few of the crystals still had light. 
 That's how we stayed safe. 
 From what? 
 Paolo. 
 Your husband? 
 He's been trying to kill us. 
 Me and Deena. 
 Kill you, why? 
 I don't know. 
 Something happened to him down here. 
 The night our lights when off, he just snapped. 
 He's still down here? Is he armed? 
 Come on. 
 This way. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Oh. Good. Wacko in the dark. 
 Love these missions. 
 Dad, you don't understand. 
 Jelco shot Hillary Oonan right in front of me and I can prove it. 
 Whatever he's doing, he's doing it under orders from the Nine. 
 Then I need to talk to Mother. 
 There are limits to what even your mother... 
 [sighs] 
 Can achieve. 
 Bullshit; she's the head of one of the Nine Families. 
 Please trust me. 
 You're safer in Spring Hill. For now. 
 Dad, you're not going to leave me with that monster. 
 [electrical whoosh] 
 I see you found my holophone. 
 We had one in every room back home. 
 You get yours on the black market? 
 [chuckles] 
 I'm Qreshi too. 
 Just not a Nine like you. 
 Here I thought the lower families knew how to show respect. 
 We've got off on the wrong foot. 
 Join me for dinner. 
 House arrest comes with a meal plan? 
 Even monsters have to eat. 
 And I have a proposition. 
 Hard pass. 
 I think I'll go for a walk. 
 [scoffs] 
 Your father's right. 
 I can only guarantee your safety in Spring Hill. 
 Remember, if you stray too close to the perimeter, pretty princess goes boom. 
 No one wants that. 
 [eerie music] 
 [water falling] 
 So, Scarbutt... [sighs] 
 I don't see what's so complicated about this. 
 You just follow the mine shaft. 
 It's gonna split in about 100 meters. 
 This mine's at least a century old. 
 Better try and stay close to the surface. 
 Got branching tunnels. 
 Yeah, he's right, there's a three-way fork up ahead. 
 [brooding music] 
 I'm not getting any readings. 
 It's probably why Lucy didn't see the mine in her scan. 
 These crystals are sucking up all the EMR. 
 That's weird. Look at that. 
 Same moss that was in the ship. 
 Yeah, it got in there somehow after the storm. 
 Must release spores carried by the wind. 
 Hey, I got Lucy sealed. 
 But we could be breathing this stuff in right now. 
 I don't know it'll grow on your lungs. 
 Probably. 
 Yeah, well, what about growing in our brains? 
 Maybe Paolo came down with a bad case of moss-head. 
 Great. Remind me to send Turin a thank you rock. 
 Careful with this, guys. 
 She's right. 
 The salt rock is super unstable and heavy as sh1t. 
 Clear, come ahead. 
 Don't touch anything. 
 [rocks rumble] 
 Be careful. 
 Ooh.

 Chronic pericardial effusion. 
 A buildup of fluid in the membrane around my heart.

 Too many generations inbreeding.

 The membrane has to be drained every day, or it'd die.
