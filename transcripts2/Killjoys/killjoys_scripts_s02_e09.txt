 Previously on "Killjoys"... 
 We're partners, and D'Avin, we're your team. 
 But I am in love with Pawter. 
 I'm not your hostage anymore, Jelco. 
 I'm your leash. 
 Power looks good on you, Seyah. 
 They want to know what the wall is for? 
 Show them. 
 The wall acts as a giant pacifier. 
 When they activate it, everyone in Old Town becomes some kind of helpless, happy drone. 
 The Company can do whatever they want to them. 
 [gunshot] 
 Ugh! 
 This is all bad. 
 Seyah Kendry sends her regards. 
 You poisoned the rations. 
 You're gonna kill all the weak and leave the strong. 
 And then what? Don't leave me hanging. 
 I don't know. 
 [dramatic music] 
 But I'm pretty sure that we're gonna stop you. 
 We're gonna save Old Town. 
 Lucy, where's Johnny? 
 In the next 48 hours, air drops of premium rations will begin. 
 Let's put an end to Old Town's suffering.

 After all she's done for Old Town, this is how you treat her? 
 What happens to her is up to her. 
 Not in my bar, Herin. 
 Oh, who says it's your bar anymore? 
 It's a brand new day in Old Town. 
 Wall's down. People on the streets. 
 Company's on the run. 
 [scoffs] 
 Oh, you ready to talk, finally? 
 How long was I out? 
 You know, when we raided Spring Hill, we found a lot of things that Jelco left behind... 
 Things they liked to use on Old Towners like us... 
 [tools clattering] 
 To make us talk. 
 Wow, that's not even remotely impressive. 
 If you're gonna poison me, at least make it glow or something. 
 Who said anything about poison? 
 Last chance. 
 Where's Liam Jelco? 
 [tense music] 
 When we get there, you keep your mouth shut. 
 You talk to anyone, I shoot you. 
 You try to run, I shoot you. 
 You do anything I don't like...

 By hanging the man who started it all with that damn wall.

 So... was your night as intense as mine? 
 [exhales] Yeah, I guess we need to talk. 
 Nope, you need to listen. 
 [high-pitched tone] 
 Oh! 
 Why do you hate me? 
 That was two seconds of sonar blast pitched down enough to hear. 
 From what? 
 It originates from the wall, John. 
 Lucy gave us audio scramblers so we could go in and grab you. 
 And what's that? 
 Those are schematics of mood-controlling technology we found last night in Arkyn. 
 Seem familiar? 
 Wait, you went back to Arkyn without me? 
 You went rogue and got your ass arrested, remember? 
 Right. Bygones. Continue. 
 Once paired with neural pathways, the wall controls moods. 
 It can create feelings ranging from mild depression to blissful satisfaction to manic rage. 
 [groans] 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 How did you feel last night? 
 [sighs] Happy. 
 Really happy. 
 It wasn't real.

 I don't wear pants. 
 I know, I'm just... 
 I'm a spaceship, John. 
 I... [sighs] Never mind. 
 The sample contains multiple additional chemical elements, yentazine, lorex, pytar. 
 Special compounds that turget the frail and feeble. 
 That's how the Company's doing it. 
 They're poisoning all of Old Town? 
 Why? 
 They're culling the herd, wiping out the old and sick, leaving only the strongest, most profitable workers for the Company. 
 Who never complain, because the wall won't let them. 
 People are dying inside that wall. 
 We need to go back to Old Town and tell everyone to stop eating that sh1t. 
 Trust me, it won't work. 
 A friend was murdered in front of me last night, and I didn't feel anything. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 The wall won't let you. 
 Plus, the only way to take down the wall is to overload it somehow or take out its power source in Spring Hill. 
 We end this now. 
 Look, I know you both had your secret plan, but if you don't mind, we'd quite like to join. 
 How? 
 Even if we arrest Jelco, he's got so many allies inside the Company. 
 Who said anything about arresting? 
 Liam Jelco is a murderer, a sadist, and a threat to everyone in Old Town. 
 Tonight we bring down his wall, and then he dies. 
 So, how we getting in? 
 Well, the entry point's through one of the old viaducts they dropped Spring Hill on... Should still be accessible. 
 I just used it two days ago. 
 Would this be when you got busted and thrown into a jail cell? 
 Well, that plan had kinks, which were already made clear to me, what with the ensuing arrest, ass-beating, and friend-berating. 
 You mean Dutch? 
 Oh, you guys will kiss and make up. 
 It's what you do. 
 Hells, I tried to kill her, and we got past it. 
 [sighs] I don't know, man. 
 It's weird. 
 What's weird? 
 You chose Dr. Crazy-Pants over our Lady of Perpetual Ass-kicking. 
 Dutch got jealous. 
 Have you met Dutch? 
 Does that sound like her? 
 No, it does not. 
 So when are you gonna man up and ask her what it's really about? 
 'Cause it kind of looks like you already made the choice anyway. 
 What? 
 I forgot we even... 
 Crazy night, right? 
 Let's go over the entry plan again. 
 Yeah. 
 [tense music] 
 All right, boys are ready. Let's do this. 
 Dutch, a second. 
 I want to say thank you... 
 For the clothes, for coming to get us. 
 He lied to me. 
 He's never done that. 
 I'm sorry. I asked him to. 
 I figured. 
 And I'm only doing this now, because to be perfectly honest, Seyah Simms, you're not up for this. 
 And if you tried to do this without me, you'd probably get yourself killed and Johnny with you. 
 I would never ask him to risk himself. 
 But you already did.

 Trust me, I know the way.

 Can't be badass and make your own jokes. 
 It's just weird. 
 Oh... 
 50 joy this is the one that powers the wall. 
 Looks like the tech they had on Arkyn, just newer. 
 So why is sh1t from Arkyn showing up in the guts of a Company building? 
 Hello, I'm Julian, the Administration Matrix for Spring Hill. 
 You appear to be looking for a way into one of our power generators. 
 Oh, hey, there, little buddy. 
 We're just looking to bypass a blown power conduit. 
 That's odd. 
 I don't see a blown power conduit. 
 [device beeping] 
 [electricity crackles] 
 Oh, there it is. 
 Yeah, it's probably fastest just to turn over all manual controls of the generators to me for repairs, huh? 
 Hmm, that would appear to be the most efficient solution... 
 See? Computers love me. 
 Except that Spring Hill is in the midst of a Company-mandated, system-wide changeover. 
 Whoa, whoa, changeover? Since when? 
 So you will need a deca-set encrypted access code if you wish to proceed further, which you would know if you really belonged here. 
 Unless you think I'm stupid. 
 Do you think I'm stupid? 
 You were saying? 
 Wow. 
 Whoever programmed this is an asshole. 
 Yeah, well, my asshole's bigger than his asshole.

 What am I supposed to do with this? 
 You point this part, you pull this part, and bang, bad guy falls down. 
 It's set to lethal, so if I can't take the shot at Jelco, you're gonna have to. 
 I can't just shoot someone. 
 Really? 
 You cut off your own sister's hand and strapped a bomb to Jelco's heart. 
 Yes, but I didn't set it off. 
 There's a difference. I'm a doctor. 
 Anything bad I've done was to save a life, not take one. 
 Well, sometimes you got to do both. 
 This is what I mean. 
 You play at rebellion, 'cause John will do your dirty work. 
 Johnny made his own decisions. He chose a side. 
 He's a Killjoy, he doesn't take sides. 
 Well, maybe he wants to be more than just a Killjoy.

 Because he told me.

 Have you tried shooting the dick out of it? 
 What, the generator?

 Each one would go up like a mini-nuke on Ascension Day. 
 Not advisable. 
 You guys at Jelco's yet? 
 Yeah, but no Jelco. 
 Whole place looks like it's been evacuated. 
 Apparently, Spring Hill is in the midst of a system-wide changeover. 
 Doesn't that sound incredibly ominous? 
 Handed over to who? 
 Forget it, I don't care about bureaucratic bullshit. 
 Just give me a Plan B. 
 The Senbek told me that the wall controls are in Jelco's office. 
 Maybe you can at least turn off the neural interference.

 Well, after Seyah Simms here broadcast that horrific scene in Old Town across the Quad, don't I suddenly get a call from over 30 mining chiefs whose towns will go into open and violent revolt if the Company tried to put up another wall anywhere near them.

 It's not really as fun as it sounds, Seyah Simms. 
 Well, when the accord has been signed, you won't be calling me that anymore. 
 Why not?

 Everything. 
 Why? 
 'Cause I beat her. 
 This is her way of making me pay for that.
