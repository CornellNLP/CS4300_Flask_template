 It's impressive, Mal. Even for you. 
 You have lied by omission to Parliament and to your own constituents. 
 This is a "catastroFuck" of your own making. 
 The clock is ticking on my career. 
 You expect something from me. 
 And you should help me. 
 An error on the part of an over-zealous Beijing Police Officer. 
 As Mr. Paxton has said. 
 Where is Sabine Hobbs? 
 Where is she? 
 How long do we have to maintain this illusion? She is blind, not stupid. 
 Mr. Huxley, when was the last time someone from the Consulate saw Sabine? 
 Did Sabine have any involvement with dissident groups? 
 Hi. 
 Ivy. Ivy Chen. 
 How did you know Mr. Rankin? 
 How do you explain the relationship between you, Loyd Rankin and Ivy Chen? 
 There are two numbers here. Were either of them retrieved? 
 Not that I know of. 
 I think one of you has picked up something that doesn't belong to you. 
 Give me the SIM. 
 The Dalgetty investigation has been shut down. 
 Any particular reason? 
 Inter-Agency matter. 
 I'm in trouble, Harry. 
 Kim, you're scaring me. 
 [Crying] 
 You'll catch your death out here. 
 Why did you bring me here? 
 Don't come any closer. 
 I'ts a bit melodramatic. 
 Really? How did your mother die? 
 You think I killed your mother? 
 She falls from the balcony of a 4th floor apartment. 
 You get arrested on the same day. 
 The only person who could make the link between you and my mother, turns up dead. 
 Look, I don't know what Loyd told you. 
 No one killed your mother, Ivy. 
 She was... 
 She was unhappy. 
 But there are people here who wanna do me harm. 
 And I don't want you to get caught up in that. 
 The Vienna Conservatory. Degree in Musicology. 
 I'll... I'll cover your fees, your board. 
 All blood money. 
 Look, I'm trying to protect you. 
 I don't want your help. I don't want anything more to do with you. 
 Do not try to see me again. 
 If you do, I will call the police. 
 I will call the newspapers. Maybe this time you will actually get charged. 
 Just stop it, Ivy. 
 Don't! Just... [Scream] 
 Okay... 
 Get away from me! 
 Calm down, okay? 
 Is everything alright? 
 Name? 
 Phone, camera, recording device. 
 Putting it down, as well. 
 Hetty? 
 Aw, Les. 
 How are you? 
 It's like we lost him twice. 
 Bloody Fort Knox. 
 I wanted him burried on the farm, did you know? 
 They won't allow it. 
 Yeah. The Director likes to be in control. 
 It's so f*ckin' hot in here! 
 Turn it down, somebody is gonna collapse. 
 Sorry, Sir, but... 
 What?! 
 You're gonna run a f*ckin' war but you can't operate a heater? 
 The heating is not on, Sir. 
 I know we're all shocked and saddened by the sudden loss of our colleague. 
 And friend. 
 Before we begin, however, I'd like to remind you all of the need to be circumspect when a tragic personal event invites the curiosity of outsiders. 
 Benjamin Lesley Gordon joined what was then the Defense Signals Directorate in the intake of 2001, after a brilliant academic career at the Australian National University. 
 That brilliance continued in the work that he did at the Directorate. 
 From his arrival in 2001, until his passing last week. 
 [Singing] 
 Senator Paxton? 
 Mrs. Hobbs... 
 No one is telling me anything. 
 All I get from the Consulate are empty assurances. 
 What's the Government doing? 
 Mrs. Hobbs, I can fully appreciate your concern... 
 I do not know where Sabine is. 
 Or how she is, or even if... 
 I, I just wanna hear her voice. 
 Look, I can only... reiterate the Government's assurances... 
 Bullshit! 
 Your Government is doing everything it can to aggravate China. 
 Moving warships into the South China Sea. 
 How do you think warmongering is going to help Sabine? You're making things worse! 
 Okay, I can't continue this conversation... 
 I want to speak to my daughter. 
 Yes, I appreciate that... 
 I want to know if she is alright. 
 Yes. 
 I... I want to know if she is alive. 
 Cancel my meetings. 
 That oxidized tin soldier, McAuliffe, is wandering around Parliament, trying to wrangle a war. 
 Just the South China Sea or is he thinking of expanding? 
 Who knows? 
 But I'm gonna find out. 
 I've got a friend in Catering, who'll know. 
 Hi, Barbara, it's Ronnie. 
 Look, have you had any orders in the past 15, 20 minutes? 
 Thank you. 
 Heavy frost this morning, General. 
 Well, we'll see worse before Winter is over. 
 [Muffled] - Thank you, Melanie. 
 Good morning, General. Room for one more? 
 Plenty of room, Mal. 
 Cups are on the sideboard. Help yourself. 
 So which of my warships are you two planning to send out next? 
 The General is here to discuss National Security Legislation. 
 Safer Australia Agency. 
 I see you haven't lost your yearn for the Orwellian, Catriona. 
 It's a dangerous world, Mal. 
 We can't take a *** approach to intelligence. 
 So you want a centralized Agency that will collect, pretty much, all the electronic communications through Australia, Asia and the Middle East, linked to the Five Eyes military satellites. 
 Hum, we're gathering the Intelligence, anyway. 
 Only now you get to to cross-reference Auntie Margaret's Christmas calls, with vision from an armed drone. 
 Do, do I need a warrant for any of this? 
 No. Just authorization from the Minister, that happens to be you, Catriona. 
 This is a bill for a Police State. 
 With you as the big fat spider in the center of it. 
 This thing will never get through Cabinet. 
 There are still a few surviving civilibitarians in the building and Martin Toohey is one of them. 
 That thing has got two chances: f*ck all and none. 
 Mal! 
 Don't waste your breath, Catriona. 
 Mal! 
 You're wounded, Mal. 
 Trailing blood all over camper. 
 Your supporters have turned their backs. 
 Toohey wants nothing to do with you. 
 I may be the only friend you have left! 
 Well, than I'm in trouble. 
 I'm concerned. 
 A Minister of the Crown, implicated in a crime and yet no investigation. 
 I wonder if ASIO or the Federal Police might wanna look a little more closely. 
 Dig around a little bit. 
 Find something... fresh. 
 Hum? 
 f*ck you. 
 Eloquent as ever. 
 Shifty hard-ass caprine bureaucrats. 
 I want to know the truth, Het. 
 I'm not gonna get it from them. 
 But I am gonna find out what happened. 
 Nothing stays hidden in this town for long, Les. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 Ben was pretty good at keeping his secret. 
 And it was easier for me to understand Ben... becoming a woman. 
 But to understand him leaving you? 
 Come one, we'll get you another cup of tea. 
 No. 
 It's a long drive home and the bladder isn't what it was. 
 You'll always be welcome at the farm, Het. 
 You're done with that, aren't you? 
 I'll talk to you soon. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 And yours. 
 Oh well, I'm needed right back at the office. 
 Hey, Thomas. 
 Yeah? 
 Have you been questioned by the police yet? 
 Has anyone from the Directorate? 
 Because I've already been called in 3 times. 
 Hum... We... Oh! I really, really need to get a half-day, so... 
 Thomas, everyhting here, points to an agency covering-up. 
 Hum... 
 I don't know anything. 
 Goodbye, Harriet. 
 You are toxic, Mal. Stay the f*ck away! 
 I wanna see him. 
 My advice to you is to keep your head down, Save me... 
 ...until everyone has forgotten about this Chinese debacle. 
 Are you finished? 
 I will not cop a lecture from you while he hides there in his office. 
 Come on, mate! 
 Don't call me mate! 
 Mate is a term that is earned. 
 Isn't it, Marty? 
 It is earned over years of watching someone's back, rounding up someone's supporters and knifing their enemies. 
 And doing favors that even his Chief of Staff has no idea about. 
 In here. 
 Not you. 
 Catriona Bailey is... out of control. 
 She is trying to turn this country into a dictatorship, with herself as Chief of the Stasi. 
 You've seen the bill. 
 It's the old one-two combination. 
 Start a war and while everyone is shit-scared about the foreign hordes, you relieve them of their civil rights. 
 Catriona Bailey has not started a war. 
 But she is part of the escalation! 
 Reaction and overreaction. 
 Until we're sandwiched between two heavily armed super powers. 
 Neither of whom will back down. 
 Bailey is in my good books. 
 She didn't publicly humiliate me. 
 Look, I think I can arrange a prisoner's swap. 
 And we can get Sabine Hobbs home. 
 Mal, if I hear the words 'Paxton' and 'China' on the same day, if you so much as drink a cup of Chinese tea, I will sack you from the Cabinet. 
 And then I will make sure you lose pre-selection. 
 Bailey supports you when it serves her best interests. 
 The minute that changes, she will roll right over you. 
 And I'm prepared for that. 
 Did you prefer coffee? 
 Sorry about that. I'll clean that up. 
 Just give me a moment. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Do you have a warrant? 
 He was a friend. 
 A friend with a house key? 
 So, Charles Dancer. Kim and I were colleagues. Across Agencies. 
 ASIO? 
 It doesn't show... 
 She never mentioned you. 
 I never mentioned her. 
 The Agencies have rules, as you know. 
 Were you two involved? 
 Can I get you a Vodka? 
 You know, f*cking her doesn't give you the right to help yourself. 
 I brought it with me. 
 Well, I would prefer that you didn't drink it here. 
 You're gonna leave the key. 
 Is ASIO investigating? 
 As far as I'm aware, it's a Police matter. 
 Even the Police don't have a clue. 
 They probably think it was me. 
 Well, then... 
 You might find yourself in need of a friend. 
 [Crying] 
 Harry, listen... 
 Remember the shared house? 
 You were right. 
 You were right about a lot of things. 
 Harry, listen... 
 Remember the shared house? 
 You were right. 
 You were right about a lot of things. 
 We have to avoid conflict. 
 That's not on my agenda. 
 But nobody is thinking rationally, with Sabine Hobbs in jail. 
 You must be able to arrange some sort of prisoners' swap, surely. 
 I didn't come here to be lobbied. 
 Make an appointment with my office. 
 Stay. 
 What does Beijing want in return for Sabine? 
 Whatever it is, I'm sure that my office... 
 Whatever it is, you can't give. 
 And don't pretend you care about her. 
 This is about your job. 
 If Australia ends up in conflict you won't last long. 
 Just let Sabine talk to her mother. 
 And then? 
 What will you want next? 
 Tell me we both want the same thing. 
 [Electronic door opens] 
 Hello, Sabine. 
 Mr. Zheng. 
 Your mother is anxious to speak to you. 
 And I am anxious for that to happen. 
 Tea. 
 Tell me about your friends in the Choir. 
 The ones that helped you organize your protest. 
 No. 
 I've told you before. 
 I won't. 
 I can't. 
 I understand. 
 But I need your help. 
 And your mother. She must be so sad. 
 Kim left it for me. It's some sort of message but I just can't work it out. 
 Let's have a look. 
 It's encrypted. 
 It's heavily encrypted. 
 Okay, here we go. I've got something. 
 I can tell you when the file was uploaded. 
 Ok, well, I can tell you that. It was last Thursday. The day that Kim died. 
 No. It was before that. 
 Two weeks ago. July the 23rd. 
 July the 23rd? 
 Is that important? 
 
 
 
 Your student. The boy who was in the Choir with Sabine. Kevin? 
 Yeah. Kevin Dang. 
 Can I speak to him? 
 Hum... I don't have a number, but he lives across Campus with his girlfriend. Second floor, 4A, Fenahall. 
 Can you keep it somewhere safe? 
 Hey, I... I got some wine. 
 Why don't you stay? 
 I'll... I will come back later, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 Kevin got a message about 2 hours ago and rushed out. 
 I've been calling him and calling him but he's not answering. 
 Did he take anything with him? 
 Cassie, did you and Kevin know the boy from the lake? 
 Max Dalgety. 
 Yeah. 
 Max was like Kevin's twin brother. 
 They spoke there in secret geek speak. 
 Max studied Computer Science? 
 I guess so. 
 They'd go into the room for days. Living off nothing but packet noodles and cider. 
 Okay. Do you know what they were doing? 
 No way. It was like a kosher kitchen. 
 Kevin uses my laptop and Wi-Fi for UNI work, and anything personal. I can check his e-mails and open Facebook, but anything to do with Max, strictly quarantined. 
 So, what do you think they were doing? 
 I never asked. 
 I wouldn't have gotten answered, anyway. 
 I'm guessing it was something Darknet. 
 Something illegal? 
 Is Kevin in some sort of trouble? 
 I'm calling him again. 
 [Calling] 
 Something's gotta be wrong. 
 Cassie, do you mind...? 
 [Calling] 
 [Phone vibrating] 
 Hello? 
 It's Harriet. 
 You scared the f*ckin' sh1t out of me! How did you get this number? 
 The SIM! You haven't connected it to anything yet, have you? 
 Why? 
 sh1t! 
 Felix, it's... it's Max Dalgety's, the guy from the lake. 
 f*ck! 
 Are you online now? 
 Shut it down! Disconnect it. Take the SIM out of the phone. 
 Okay, okay, okay. I'm doing it, I'm doing it. 
 I'm gonna get you to bring it to me. I'll let you know where and when. 
 I think I can crack this. 
 No. 
 I've already started running RAM bots, I was looking for the key. 
 Felix, you can't go back to your room. You can't go back to UNI, ok? 
 Not until it's safe. 
 That's *** tomorrow. 
 Well, you can just cancel them. And call in sick. 
 Alright? 
 Have you got a friend that you can stay with just for a few days? 
 Or... a friend that, that maybe can book you into a hotel or a near B&B, under their name? 
 And I'll cover all the costs. 
 Yeah, yeah, I can talk to Andy Brackenback. 
 It's just... Just for a couple of days. Just until we know it's safe. 
 I'll get this decrypted and then I'll publish the story and we should be fine. 
 I wanna do this. 
 No. 
 I'll do it right, this time. Completely off the grid. 
 Air gap laptop, SIM reader, external hard drive. That's all I need. 
 I can download the decryption software from a public computer. 
 There's no trace there. 
 And we get burner phones with... with Threema. Just fully encrypted communication. 
 Who else are you gonna get? 
 Thomas? It's Harriet Dunkley. 
 I'm out the front and I need to speak to you. 
 Look, you can come out or I'll come up and ask for you in person. 
 Can we go somewhere else? 
 No. 
 I can't talk to you. 
 Look, I know about Max Dalgety and I know about the SIM. 
 Dalgety was shut down. 
 But Kim was still pursuing it, wasn't she? 
 Why was it shut down, Thomas? 
 I don't know. 
 I... I don't know anything. 
 Yes you do! Someone killed her, Thomas! 
 They bashed her and strangled her and left her to rot and she was your friend! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to get her in trouble. 
 What do you mean? 
 She should have stopped. 
 I had to tell him. 
 It's my job. 
 Who did you tell? 
 Vaughn. 
 I told Vaughn. 
 [Keypad beeping] 
 46 year-old Canberra man, Gareth Robbie, has been arrested for the murder of public servant, Kim Gordon. 
 Robbie, an economist in the Department of Finance, is a married father of two. 
 He is believed to have been involved in a romantic relationship with the victim. 
 His family are not responding to inquiries. 
 But neighbours say they are shocked by the arrest. 
 Poor Gareth. I wonder if he's got the "thank me" Doughssant. 
 It's bullshit. 
 Oh, no... 
 Olmstead has got phone records, texts, chats on Grindr, calls placing him at Kim's four times, and a text message asking to meet at the place that Kim died. 
 And why would a Detective be giving you all of this before the Committal? 
 Wouldn't you like to know? 
 You're supposed to be on leave. 
 Kim left me a coded message, leading to a *** SIM with an encrypted file, that I think she smuggled out of the Signals Directorate. 
 Twenty years jail, for even looking at it. 
 There's a defense. If the disclosure is in the public interest. 
 And is it in the public interest? 
 Well, it hasn't been decrypted... yet. 
 I need cash, Gus. 
 For an air gapped computer, a new phone, a safe house, and some pretty heavy decryption software. 
 I can't authorize that. 
 Well, it's too late, Gus, 'cause I've got a PhD student close to finish it. 
 [Knocks] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Come in. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow! 
 Yeah, the kids don't move. 
 Louise and I stay here one week on, one week off. 
 Hum. Sounds like a great arrangement. 
 Yeah. You have ten minutes. 
 Okay... 
 Ah... Right. 
 The Gareth Robbie arrest. 
 Olmstead has been doing a big sell to journos, without even questioning the spokes. 
 So, either he owes ASIO a favour, or he is wanting them to owe him one. 
 Well, everything's political, but I doubt he's in anyone's back pocket. 
 So, he's being played. 
 The phone records tell the story. 
 Gareth Robbie was there when Kim died. 
 But any cyber expert with a security clearance can fake that. 
 Huh, there's PingChats, messages on dating apps, e-mails referring to motel hookups, that match Robbie's credit card, going back years. 
 How many years? 
 Well, Kim was seeing somebody else. 
 Not Robbie. 
 An ASIO agent. 
 Named Charles Dancer. 
 She told you this? 
 Well, not in so many words, but I could tell that she was falling in love. 
 I'd seen that look before. 
 And that's it? 
 That's the reason you believe that my boss is bent? 
 Barry Young said he doesn't think I'm a team player. 
 You want me to fly to the top of his sh1t, least that you can at least tell me what you know. 
 Well, I just gave you Dancer. 
 And you're withholding everything else. 
 Piss off, Harriet. 
 I really got to work. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Harriet Dunkley. 
 Kevin called. He wants to meet. 
 But he wants me to bring all of his computers. 
 I don't know what's going on. 
 Alright, Cassie, can you tell me where? 
 Meet me in New Acton? 
 Hey. 
 I think the meeting place is a coded message. 
 Café Mocean? 
 Kevin hates cafés. 
 He can't stand the smell of coffee. He can't stand the taste. 
 I think it's his way of telling me that something is not right. 
 He may be watched. 
 When Kevin approaches, call me. 
 And then put your phone on speaker, and I'll record the conversation. 
 What should I ask him? 
 Just keep him talking. 
 Sho... Should I mention Max? 
 No. No. Definitely not. 
 It's okay. 
 It's fine. 
 [Incoming Call] 
 [Recorder Beep] 
 My computers? 
 They are all there. 
 You're okay? 
 Australia is not working out for me. 
 It's time to go home. 
 Home? 
 What about UNI? 
 It's better I finish my studies in China. 
 But what about me? 
 I miss home. 
 The are many opportunities there. 
 You miss your family? 
 You wanna take care of them? 
 Yes. 
 Coffee? 
 Hum... Double shot macchiato. 
 Okay. No worries. 
 I understand, Kevin. 
 I'll wait for you. 
 I have to go. 
 [Cut off call] 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hubei Women's Prison. 
 Connecting you now. 
 Hello? Sabine? 
 Mom? 
 Aw... sweetheart. 
 Aw, you're alright. 
 It's so good to hear you. 
 I'm not quite sure what I can do here. But I promise I'm gonna keep digging, alright? 
 Thank you. 
 No problem. I'll talk to you soon. 
 That's the information you requested on Bailey and McAuliffe. 
 It's mostly Cabinet briefings, estimates and prepared answers for question time. 
 So this is not all of it. 
 Oh, God, no. It's just what I had in the office and what I could get my hands on. 
 [Incoming Skype call] 
 Hang on, I've gotta take this. 
 Hello, Dylan. 
 Mom said I had to call. 
 Geez, what happened to your face, mate? 
 Dyl! 
 Tried to get myself a piercing. 
 Oh, yeah? I know what a punch in the head looks like, mate. 
 Are you talking to your father, Dylan? 
 I'm talking to him now! 
 What's this "Cerberus"? 
 Every Friday, the ComCar drivers take some pro-American w*nk*rs to the Commonwealth Club for lunch with their American counterparts. 
 And they call it "Cerberus"? 
 Cerberus is the three-headed dog of Greek Mythology. 
 It guards the gates of hell. 
 Well, there you go. Who punched you, Dylan? 
 Was it one of those pricks from that toff-y school of yours? 
 I've gotta go. If Mom asks, tell her I spoke to you. 
 Dylan! [Cuts call] 
 There are 3 names that keep popping up on the guests' list. 
 That's Bailey, McAuliffe and... 
 Paul Wheeler. 
 Head of ASIO. 
 Keep on chasing this. Any links between these three and any references to "Cerberus". 
 Don't hide the fact that you're digging. 
 Let's turn the light on. 
 See if the cockroaches scurry. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Veronica Beaudony. 
 sh1t! 
 Minister... 
 Does Mal Paxton know the PM is going to Japan? 
 He'll know soon enough. 
 Well, he is a dead man walking, anyway. 
 It's probably time we stopped making predictions about what Mal Paxton will or won't survive. 
 What a waste of Australian Pinot Noir. 
 Those warships we sent to play chicken in the South China Sea. 
 One of them has crashed into a Chinese patrol boat. 
 Which one?! 
 An escort vessel for the HMAS Anzac, I believe. 
 One of the Chinese sailors has gone overboard. He's drowned. 
 Jesus! 
 Any loss of life will make it impossible for the Chinese to back down. 
 You fuckwit smart, get this, we won it, after all. 
 [Door knocking] 
 Who's seen your Constable Sean Brimmer? 
 So, you've met. 
 I've just had to endure a humiliating interview with a federal in uniform police officer. 
 Digging into my personal life. 
 Prompted by information provided by you. 
 Well, Gareth Robbie didn't do it. 
 And so what? Your response is to sic Police onto me? 
 You think he did? 
 Not for a minute. 
 You're right. 
 We were together. 
 [Incoming text message] 
 [Calling] 
 Look, I just got a call from Andy, the guy whose ID we used to get this place. 
 His place has been turned over. 
 What? 
 They took his laptop, they've taken his Ipad, everything! 
 They even cut a hole in his matress. The guy is freakin' out! 
 What does it mean? If they know about him, do they know where I am? 
 Do I have to get out? 
 No, you... 
 You stay there, I'm gonna come right over. 
 Alright, make it quick. 
 You wanna help? 
 The room of ANU student Andrew Brackenback was just raided and I wanna know who authorized the warrant. 
 Why? 
 Can you do that? 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 Vaughn. 
 Kim's old boss at Signals Directorate. 
 Who's Felix Crawford? 
 There's a warrant out for his arrest. 
 Police are on their way to him right now. 
 Come with me. 
 [Calling] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Felix. We're in the car, on our way to you. 
 I've just wiped the hard drive. 
 We're two minutes away. 
 But Felix, keep the SIM, alright? 
 sh1t, the cops are here! 
 sh1t! 
 f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! 
 I need you to hold on to the SIM, ok? 
 What SIM? What SIM? 
 Max Dalgety's. 
 f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! 
 Felix, tell me what's happening. I can't... I can't hear you. 
 sh1t! 
 Federal Police, open up! 
 Felix? Are you there? 
 Okay, Felix, we're here. 
 Have you got the SIM? 
 Felix? 
 Have you got the SIM, Felix? What's happening? 
 Turn around.
