 Madeline :  Previously on  American Gothic... 
 Tell me you never killed anyone. 
 I can't do that. 
 And if I don't do exactly as Alison says, I'll end up in jail. 
 I need you to get me something on Conley. 
 Something I can use. 
 That's the lead detective in the SBK case. 
 Continue to pursue me, and people will die. 
 No! No, you're...! 
 The people of Boston believed that the Silver Bells horror had died along with Mitchell Hawthorne. 
 But after his presumed accomplice murdered local reporter Jennifer Windham, the city has been in panic mode. 
 Newton resident Celeste Dubinski pushed her new gardener down the stairs and locked him in the cellar. 
 “He seemed sketchy in a Silver Bells way,” Dubinski said. 
 Catching this killer is my number one priority. 
 Which is why I urge the public to let us focus our resources, and stop calling 911 every time you hear a bell ring. 
 Linda :  Déjà vu. 
 My gut says copycat. 
 You and your gut were in middle school when SBK first struck in 1999. 
 I was one of the first on the scene. 
 (sighs) 
 This matches it to the letter. 
 So I need you to drop the charges. 
 The only thing Garrett Hawthorne is guilty of is wearing too much flannel. 
 You've read the most recent forensics report, right? 
 These knots on Jennifer. 
 Exactly the same as the knots from 14 years ago. 
 You smell that? 
 Pine. 
 Somehow this copycat knew that SBK cleaned up all his murders with pine-scented cleaner. 
 District Attorney :  Copycat killers  can be incredibly faithful. 
 Oh, I guess you haven't gotten to the part about the bell. 
 It's got the little indentation on the inside. 
 Just like the bells from the other murders. 
 That detail was never released to the public. 
 Linda :  How would a copycat have gotten one? 
 You see the problem, Jeff? 
 You can't prosecute Garrett Hawthorne for being Silver Bells' accomplice, while the actual Silver Bells' accomplice keeps murdering people. 
 My son is clearly innocent. 
 Rectify the situation. 
 Jennifer :  Continue to pursue me, and people will die. 
 No! No, you're si...! 
 Continue to pursue me, and people will die. 
 No! No, you're si...! 
 Continue to pursue me, and people... 
 The charges are being dropped. 
 Your brother will be a free man again in a matter of hours. 
 That's great news. 
 Alison, what's going on? 
 Jennifer's murder... 
 A lesser person might make a scathing remark about karma right now, but I will rise above. 
 What is it? 
 (knocking) 
 There's someone here to see you. 
 Not now. 
 Yeah. I don't think she's making an appointment. 
 Mrs. Hawthorne. Ah, good. Two birds, one stone. 
 Could you compile the cards, letters, guest book, anything you can find, from your husband's funeral? 
 Excuse me? 
 I'll send someone over to collect them soon. 
 What for? 
 I'm trying to solve a murder case that has national attention and FBI oversight. 
 I ask you for something, please cooperate. 
 And speaking of cooperation, we're investigating the Jennifer Windham murder. 
 It's odd. 
 Your name keeps popping up, Councilwoman. 
 As soon as you free one of my children, you implicate another. 
 What bizarre obsession do you have with my family? 
 I feel like you want me to go. 
 Yes. 
 Well, I'm happy to go, but I'll need you to come with me to the station. 
 I don't think so. 
 Fair enough. 
 But be aware, someone from the press may ask me if Alison Hawthorne-Price is being questioned in the Silver Bells murders, and I will be forced to tell them that you are not cooperating with the authorities. 
 Boston Globe? 
 Yes, uh, politics section, please. 
 Or crime, whatever's faster. 
 (lock buzzes) 
 (latch clicks) 
 It takes a little paperwork, and then, uh, I should be out in a few hours. 
 Good. 
 If you didn't do it, you shouldn't be charged for it. 
 But you did something. 
 I asked you to tell me you never killed anyone, and you couldn't do it. 
 When you got back home, you were quiet and evasive. 
 I understood that. 
 It had to be a tough transition for you, so I tried to be patient and compassionate. 
 Tried to give you the benefit of the doubt. 
 (chuckles) 
 I defended you. 
 I believed in you. 
 And what did I get from you in return? 
 Cryptic comments. 
 Move evasiveness. 
 Kid gloves. 
 Garrett, you need to talk to me. 
 That's what I deserve. 
 When I was in the woods, there was a guy who became sort of a mentor to me. 
 His name was Al Jenkins. 
 (wheezing) 
 (groaning): Damn it. 
 Help me. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 That's heartbreaking. 
 He's buried next to his niece in Cincinnati. 
 But that was an act of mercy, not... 
 Why didn't you just tell me? 
 It's not that simple, Tess. 
 I've never told anyone that. 
 Just talk to me. 
 From now on. 
 We're family. 
 Seeing as we're telling each other everything now, um... 
 And I'm, uh... 
 What? 
 Christina's pregnant. 
 What? 
 When did you find out? 
 The other day on the phone. 
 She didn't tell me anything more than that, though. 
 We're not on very good terms, so, uh... 
 Do you want to be a father? 
 You know, if you asked me that two weeks ago, I don't know what I would have said. 
 But... 
 Ever since she told me, I, um... 
 I really want it. 
 Well, I'm learning a lot about you today. 
 (both laugh) 
 April :  Finally. 
 Mission Rehab - complete. 
 Nancy Reagan's ghost will visit you tonight, and give you a high-five. 
 (chuckling) 
 Yeah. 
 I know the transition out of here can be as tricky as the transition in. 
 You get used to the routine. 
 You're gonna miss the structure. 
 Right. 
 It's the structure I'm gonna miss. 
 Why don't you focus on all the great things that are coming your way. 
 For example, you get out early enough to go to Jack's school event. 
 Hey, uh, why don't you come with me? 
 Come meet this crazy kid I've been talking about. 
 There's a really solid, well-researched rule about romantic relationships in the first year of recovery. 
 I mean, this is Saldenbrook Elementary's Boston History Night. 
 It's incredibly unromantic. 
 (laughing) 
 The empirical data is pretty overwhelming. 
 Dating too early really increases the risk of relapse. 
 And who are we to argue with empirical data? 
 Really. 
 But, uh... 
 I loaded up your iPod with, like, gigabytes of daily affirmations. 
 So you'll feel like I'm constantly around. 
 Gigabytes. 
 How affirmed do I have to be? 
 Finnegan :  You may not think you need the help, you do. 
 It took you guys 17 years to catch one half of Silver Bells, and he was already dead. 
 I've been living and breathing this case. 
 I want your assurance you're not going to push me out of it. 
 I'm FBI. I don't make assurances to rookie detectives. 
 There's a mandatory meeting in an hour. 
 We'll discuss your participation in the case after that. 
 According to these phone records, you and Jennifer were really chatting it up the last few days. 
 Maybe you were angry she was sleeping with your husband? 
 And you killed her like Dad taught you to. 
 (scoffs) That's your theory. 
 That I kick-started a murder spree because I'm a crazy, jealous wife. 
 (door opening) 
 I don't know why you killed the blind woman, though. 
 Doesn't seem like your husband's type. 
 Carter. 
 (sighs) 
 You decide to go after my sister-in-law, and you say nothing to me? 
 Yet another conflict of interest. 
 With the FBI jumping in, it's every detective for himself... or herself. 
 If you have questions, Brady can talk to me. 
 Nobody else. 
 You don't get to make demands. 
 Unless you're gonna charge me, neither do you. 
 Or should I give my lawyer a call? 
 It's the same one that got Garrett out of jail, so... 
 (sighs) 
 So, why were you making all these calls to Jennifer? 
 Can you close the blinds? 
 Please. 
 Okay. 
 I, um... 
 I think Jennifer Windham was murdered because of me. 
 No, Alison, that doesn't make any sense. 
 It does. 
 And I think I know who murdered her. 
 I think I know who my father's accomplice is. 
 Mayor Conley. 
 Mayor Conley? 
 Your opponent. 
 The current mayor of Boston... 
 You think that he... 
 I know, I know. But it's not any more farfetched than my own father being involved. 
 (sighs) 
 You have any proof? 
 I asked Jennifer to dig into Conley because... she took certain liberties that other journalists wouldn't. 
 She brought me this. 
 Conley and Cutter? I wanted to know why Conley was taking secret, off-the-books meetings with one of the lead detectives on the Silver Bells case. 
 Jennifer followed up. She said she had something big, something connecting Conley to SBK. 
 She was about to report it... 
 You think he killed her before she could talk? 
 (sighs) 
 We're gonna need something definitive. 
 I know. 
 But if Conley was working with Cutter, who else is involved? 
 You can't trust anyone in this building. 
 (window opens) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Jack :  It was scary. 
 I mean, she shot a crossbow right at me. 
 And it stuck in, like, a foot from my head. 
 Like this. 
 (laughs) 
 Did this really happen or this something you're making up? 
 (laughs) 
 Jack, did you take something out of my closet? 
 Mm, no, not lately. 
 Why? 
 Is there something weird in there? 
 Why don't you head downstairs, Jack? 
 There's a fresh tray of cookies waiting for you. 
 I think we feed him too much sugar. 
 Right. Sugar's the problem there. 
 Look, now that you and Sophie are really, finally splitting up, I think you should fight for sole custody. 
 I don't think I could do that to her. 
 I mean, she'd be... 
 I know she loves him. 
 But as far as parenting, we both know he's better off with you. 
 She's helping him with his history project later, so I'll go by and see how she's doing. 
 And then I'll think about it, okay? 
 Okay. 
 (lock buzzes) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Did you manage to get a hold of Christina? 
 The number is no longer in service. 
 Did you try the clinic? 
 She told them she was, uh, laying low for a bit. 
 They're not even sure if she's still in Boston. 
 Really? 
 Look, I mean, imagine it from her point of view. 
 There's an accomplice, you were arrested... 
 She's scared. 
 She'll find out that you've been cleared, that there is nothing connecting you to any of the murders. 
 She'll turn up. Or you'll find her. 
 She's out there. 
 Voilà. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 (laughs) 
 I got everything we talked about and a couple extra things, too. 
 Did you get the soda? 
 Two two-liters. (gasps) 
 Damn, I left 'em by the elevator. 
 I'll get it. 
 Don't you think we should cut down on his sugar intake? 
 The soda's not for drinking. 
 It's for death. 
 Um... you don't think you could steer him towards a history project that's a little more... normal? 
 It's supposed to be about Boston. 
 I don't know if you were awake in school, but Boston's history is pretty damn bloody. 
 Okay. 
 So, I think... 
 Whoa. 
 I think we're gonna need some more soda, Mom. 
 I'll get some more on our candy break. 
 Yeah, sugar. 
 Cam, whatever. 
 All right, just a little warning, 'cause I don't want you getting caught off guard, but the lawyer will be sending paperwork by this week. 
 The, uh, lawyer your mommy got you? 
 Yeah, I really can't wait to see what it says. 
 Come on. 
 (door closes) 
 Brady : Yeah. You double-checked the calendar? 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Was that Conley's assistant? 
 Yeah. 
 What did she say? 
 Well, she's being oddly evasive about his whereabouts on the day of the murder. 
 Did Jennifer make any reference about what kind of information she had? 
 Only that it was about Conley. 
 She sent this text saying that she was “fiercely protective” of her sources. 
 We should start at her apartment. 
 If I'm gonna hand all this over, at least I want an explanation. 
 Well, we have reason to believe the SBK accomplice attended Mitchell's funeral. 
 That's all I can tell you. 
 Appreciate your cooperation. 
 We'll be in touch. 
 I think Cam borrowed it. 
 He say where he was going? 
 No. I can take you wherever you need to go. 
 No. No, I need my truck. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna go wash up. 
 Why the hell were you at Mitchell's funeral? 
 With everything that went on between you two, you never should have been there. 
 Tessa : Garrett's home. 
 Oh, that's wonderful. 
 Is he... 
 He's upstairs. 
 Hey, Mom, why did I see an FBI agent just leave the house? 
 You should ask your husband. 
 Their latest theory is that the accomplice was someone at the funeral. 
 Of course they're gonna start with us. 
 They'll come to their senses. 
 The only thing we can do in the meantime... is try and stay united. 
 April : Temptation is natural. 
 Temptation is natural. 
 What you've done is not who you are. 
 What I've done is not who I am. 
 Oh, God! 
 Oh, God. 
 Hey. 
 Welcome back. 
 You got my keys. 
 Uh, yeah. Where you going? 
 I got to run an errand. 
 You're so bad at being specific. 
 Uh, how long you be gone for? 
 It's none of your business, Cam. 
 Give me my keys. 
 Hey, man, listen. 
 I'll be damned if I let you run out on us again without going to... 
 Boston History Night. 
 What? 
 Uh, well, I told Jack that you were getting out of jail, and he was all excited you'd get to see his big presentation. 
 He said that you'd like it. 
 Give me my keys. 
 I have to go. 
 Listen, man. 
 For whatever reason, Jack feels a real connection with you. 
 And since his mom might not be a big part of his life anymore, it would mean a lot if you were. 
 (sighs) It's your call. 
 
 
 
 April : There are no losers, just slow winners. 
 There are no losers, just slow winners. 
 Looks fiercely protective to me. 
 Okay. Any ideas? 
 I thought you'd have, like, safecracking gear or something. 
 I'm a detective, not Thomas Crown. 
 (sighs) Okay. Look at her. 
 She's sexy, she's self-aggrandizing, narcissistic. 
 (clicking) 
 (groans) 
 What did you try? 
 36-24-36. 
 (scoffs) 
 You got any better ideas? 
 Her birthday? 
 The day she pretends is her birthday. 
 Maury Povich's birthday. 
 (sighs) 
 My husband's birthday. 
 Date of her first onscreen appearance? 
 The ratings of her first time on air. 
 Ratings from the time she had that micro-pig on the show, and it went viral. 
 Oh, God, yeah. 
 That pig could really dance. 
 Mmm. 
 (whispering): Yeah, I'm done. 
 She spent her whole career at Channel 12. 
 We could try 12-12-12. 
 (scoffs) It can't be that easy. 
 She bugged him. 
 You said the rep from the election commission would be here at 5:00. 
 She's running late. Traffic. 
 Probably because of that left-turn light you put on Pilgrim Street. 
 Linda : What the hell is going on here? You told me you had enough evidence to arrest her. 
 It's an ambush. 
 (typing) 
 Conley : There was an accomplice? You reopened the case? 
 You're supposed to tell me these things. 
 Linda : We've already arrested Garrett Hawthorne. 
 Conley : Good. That's good. 
 Because we can't afford someone digging around. 
 Linda : Stop being paranoid. 
 I destroyed the evidence that ties you to the crime scene. 
 You recorded us without our consent. 
 That's illegal. 
 We didn't record it. 
 Jennifer Windham did. And then she was murdered. 
 You let me and my family go through that horror show when you were working with my father the whole time. 
 No. No. 
 The night David Morales was murdered, I was over at his house. 
 I'd just started putting together my mayoral campaign, and I needed his help getting access to some of the political elite. 
 Why would he help you? 
 I helped him with his business when he was starting out. 
 I thought he'd be up for a little “I scratched your back, now you scratch mine.” 
 But as it turns out, he wasn't amenable to my political leanings. 
 I got angry, he got angry, we shouted some things, and I stormed out. 
 The next morning, I heard on the news that he was... that he killed by Silver Bells, just hours after I left him. 
 And then I realized in all the chaos, I lost a cufflink at his house. 
 I freaked out a little bit, okay? 
 I didn't kill him. 
 But I figured if the police traced it back to me, I'd be a person of interest. 
 In a major serial killer case. 
 My whole political future would go up in smoke. 
 So then you went to Cutter? 
 I was new on the force, but I had access. 
 What I didn't have, though, was money. 
 My dad was losing his house, and I-I... needed help. 
 How much did you pay her to destroy the evidence? 
 25 grand. 
 (scoffs) LINDA: Covered most of my dad's bills. 
 And we were never supposed to talk about it again. 
 And then they found the belt, and they reopened the case... 
 I got a little paranoid. 
 (scoffs) That's putting it mildly. 
 You want proof I didn't kill Jennifer? 
 Check with Perry Cooper and Cindy Frye. 
 They'll confirm that I was meeting with them at the time of Jennifer's murder. 
 You were coordinating with your super PAC? 
 Yeah. 
 But as sins go, it's not quite murder. 
 (scoffs) 
 (jangling) 
 (clattering) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Mom, who is Caleb O'Connor? 
 I heard you on the phone, and I looked up his number. 
 Caleb O'Connor from Smoke Hill, Pennsylvania. 
 He's a friend of mine. 
 The conversation did not sound friendly. 
 You sounded pretty upset that he was at Dad's funeral. 
 Because your father hated him. 
 He nearly beat him to death. 
 Caleb O'Connor is... 
 The man I was having the affair with. Yes. 
 Now you're checking the numbers that I call? 
 We can't lose trust in each other. 
 Not at a time like this. 
 Hi. Oh, good. 
 (murmuring) 
 Welcome to Saldenbrook Elementary's Boston History Night. 
 First up, with a fascinating piece of local history is Jack Hawthorne. 
 (applause) 
 People run through the streets, screaming. 
 The lucky ones survive with just a broken bone. 
 But the unlucky ones are crushed or drowned. 
 But everything... is... sticky. 
 It all started with a poorly built vat of molasses. 
 The temperature suddenly rose on January 15, 1919, and the molasses became too liquid-y, and the vat... burst. 
 (rumbling) 
 The people heard a loud rumbling noise. 
 (audience chuckling) 
 It was a wave of molasses as tall as a house rushing through the streets. 
 (laughter) 
 It destroyed buildings. 
 It knocked people off their feet. 
 Some people... even died. 
 (chuckling) 
 (clopping) 
 It even stopped horses right in their tracks. 
 Forever. 
 (laughter) 
 I've been running checks on everyone who attended Mitchell's funeral. 
 Maureen Campbell knew him from when they both served on the board of a charity, a wildlife conservation charity. 
 I feel a point coming on. 
 Garrett allegedly got the knife from his father. 
 Why would a guy on the board of a wildlife conservation charity own an ivory knife? 
 I don't think Mitchell ever did actually own the knife. 
 I think it was Garrett's all along. 
 Garrett's been ruled out. 
 No, I know, I know. And I know he didn't murder Jennifer. 
 I'm saying something does not add up here. 
 You remember that mandatory meeting today? 
 You missed it. 
 Yeah, I know. And I'm sorry about that. 
 But I've been chasing down the leads, I've been making progress on this... 
 You went into the Windham crime scene without permission. 
 So then I read your whole file. 
 You're married to a Hawthorne. 
 Which has given us access that we would not have had if I hadn't... 
 It's a blatant conflict of interest. 
 I am the one who's saying that we need to reconsider Garrett! 
 Go home. 
 Be with your wife. 
 Get this case out of your head. 
 Your temporary leave begins now. 
 Hey, hey, hey! That was great, that was great. 
 I mean, you really figured out how to bring out the best of his, you know... his Jack-ness. 
 I love his Jack-ness. 
 We made a cool little man, didn't we? 
 We did. And you should be a part of his life. 
 I won't fight you on that. 
 Jack : Uncle Garrett. 
 Hey. 
 Did you like the part about the melting horse? 
 Oh yeah, that was my favorite part. 
 Hey, you listen to me. 
 Never stop being you. All right? 
 I can't not be me. It's all I am. 
 (chuckles) Exactly. 
 April! Hey. 
 Ah, you came. 
 Hey. Yeah, I, uh, guess curiosity got the best of me. 
 You totally undersold the weirdness. 
 Yeah. 
 And you... and you undersold the awesomeness. 
 I thought we couldn't... 
 Uh, yeah. No, we-we cannot be involved romantically, but I feel like, as long as we can keep this on a platonic axis, we'll be fine. 
 Right, right. 
 Right, great. I mean, 'cause when I look at you, that's all I think about. 
 (chuckles): I mean, it's just so... platonic. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Good, great. Well, that's-that's a relief. 
 'Cause that's just exactly how I feel. 
 I mean, Plato would be proud. 
 (Cam chuckles) 
 Alison : So, how are you feeling? 
 Tessa : Well, there's no morning sickness. 
 That's good. 
 Which is great, but I am so on edge, Ali. 
 Impatient. Like, I yelled at our mailman yesterday. 
 And I love our mailman. 
 That's not the pregnancy. We're all on edge. 
 (sighs) 
 At least you have a supportive spouse. 
 How are things with Tom? 
 We'll talk about it later. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 You missed a pretty wild presentation. (chuckles) 
 Yeah, well, I'm not gonna be missing any more family events for a while. 
 Why? 
 They put me on temporary leave. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Told me to get the case out of my head. 
 Oh, well, that's a novel idea. 
 Let's just put it out of our heads. 
 Easy enough. 
 Piece of cake. 
 Jack :  It's weird. 
 Hmm? 
 You're just smiling way more than usual. 
 Nah, I'm smiling more because I feel good about the future. 
 You should. 
 It has infinite possibilities. 
 That's true. No, seriously. 
 Hmm? 
 I mean, at any moment, you could be like, “I'm going this way. Whoa. No, I'm going that way” 
 (laughing) 
 Or, “I'm doing a cartwheel, I'm speaking French.” 
 (laughing continues) 
 And, if you believe in parallel universes, then all of those things are happening somewhere in the world, right now. 
 (imitates explosion) 
 Hey, look. 
 That's our candy guy. 
 Can I get some gummies? 
 (laughs): Fine, I give in. 
 Go get yourself some sugar. You've earned it. 
 Thanks, Dad! 
 No, I want my change, bud. 
 There is no change. Gummies cost 20 bucks. 
 No, seriously. 
 Every time Mom has me get gummies from that guy, it costs 20 bucks. 
 It's probably just inflation. 
 (door opens) 
 Hey. 
 (door shuts) 
 Cam, he never knew. 
 You used our son to buy drugs. 
 You gave him money and made him buy you drugs. 
 You don't have anything to say, do you? 
 Because there's no defense. 
 Cam, no... You know what this is? 
 (voice breaking): No, Cam. Please, no. 
 This is ammunition. 
 No! 
 (softly): Cam, I love you. 
 This gives me full custody of Jack. 
 Cam, please wait. Please! 
 No, Cam! Please, no! 
 Please, Cam. Don't go. 
 Please don't go. Please, please. 
 Cam, I love you. I love you. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Cam, I love you! I love you! 
 Please, Cam. Please! 
 I'm sorry, Cam. Cam, I'm sorry. Please. 
 Cam... 
 I'm gonna tell you what to do. 
 Okay. 
 So, listen to me closely. 
 Okay. I'm listening. 
 Okay. 
 Make a new life for yourself. 
 No! No, Cam. Please... 
 No. No, Cam. Make peace with the fact that Jack won't be part of it. No. Please! 
 No, Cam! 
 Cam! 
 (sobbing): Please come back! 
 No. Cam! 
 (screaming): Cam! 
 (door shuts) 
 Don't you walk away, Cam! 
 Cam, please, no. 
 (sobbing): Please! 
 No! 
 (sobbing hysterically) 
 Alison : Of all the people who could've been Dad's accomplice... the guy mom cheated with? It's an odd theory. 
 Tessa : Mom has lied before. 
 Maybe there was no affair. 
 Maybe Caleb was just the person Dad was working with. 
 So you did the sensible thing and arranged to meet with a potential murderer. 
 It's a public place! 
 Tessa? Alison? 
 Tessa : Caleb. 
 I do remember you from the funeral. 
 Yeah. Your mom, she's, uh, pretty upset about that. 
 I don't know. I just... 
 I wanted to see her face again. 
 How do you know her? 
 High school sweethearts. 
 It went past high school, right? 
 Ah. (chuckles) 
 That's what I thought this might be about. 
 Your mother and I, we, um... we had a hard time letting go of what we had. 
 The story we were told is that he found you with her, and beat you within an inch of your life. 
 Yeah. (clears throat) 
 Yeah, look, I-I still got the scars from when I hit the, uh, planter in the driveway. 
 He dragged you all the way down the stairs into the driveway? 
 “Dragged”? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 He ambushed me the moment I showed up. 
 He didn't drag you down the stairs? 
 No. 
 I never made it inside the house that day. 
 (bell rings) 
 Good choice. 
 Top of the line corn grinder. 
 How fine a grain does it get? 
 Put some fresh ears in that and... you'll end up with quite a nice cornmeal. 
 I'll take it. 
 Pretty late in the season to be harvesting corn. 
 I'm not in a super-great place at the moment, Cam... so maybe we can discuss Mom Cam, your story about someone at another sibling rendezvous. 
 Dragging a body down the steps?

 (footsteps approaching)

 We know you've been lying to us. 
 (digging) 
 (grunting)
