 One more big push! 
 Come on! One more big push! 
 Yes, that's it! 
 Ah, yes. 
 It's a boy! 
 It's a boy! 
 Look at that. 
 We have a son. 
 He's beautiful. 
 Just like his mama. 
 Would you like to cut the cord, Mr. Diaz? 
 Oh, no. That's okay. 
 You go ahead. I'll just... 
 You're a combat medic but this makes you squeamish? 
 Come on, Dad. You won't hurt him, trust me. 
 Yeah... Dad. 
 I like the sound of that, 
 Cutting the umbilical cord, not as easy as they make it sound. 
 ˙Por qué no me avisaste? 
 Your dad wasn't there. 
 He was in Galveston when you were born and then Sophia, you were... 
 That was Gulfport. Yeah. Gulfport. 
 Right, and then Adriana was an emergency C-section so you dodged that bullet three times. 
 But I always made it back in time for the good part. 
 Yeah. This part. 
 Let me see this guy. Look at this guy! 
 Oh, look at you, big guy. Look, it's Grandpa. 
 Look at you. Yeah. 
 Mom! Hey! 
 Oh. You're here. 
 Like I'd miss this! 
 My baby had a baby. 
 Honey, I couldn't get here fast enough. 
 You look good. How you feeling? 
 Oh, I couldn't be better. 
 I got a clean bill of health and a new set of boobs. 
 Mom. Well, I do. 
 They look great. 
 Well, thank you. Just call me Hot Granny. 
 And what are we calling this little darling? 
 Christopher. 
 You wanna hold him, Janet? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 Here you go. 
 Hi, baby boy. 
 How long you gonna be here for, Eddie? 
 He's back to Afghanistan next week. 
 The sooner I go, the sooner I finish my tour and come back home for good. 
 I'm holding you to that. 
 We both are. 
 Oh, it's okay, mijo. 
 What? 
 St. Christopher. 
 The patron saint of travelers. 
 To protect you and keep you safe. 
 And to remind you that you have a family to come home to. 
 I love you. 
 Both. 
 And no matter what happens, I'm always gonna fight to come home to my family. 
 This is Diaz. 
 Can anybody hear me? 
 This is Eddie. 
 I'm alive. 
 I'm still alive down here! 
 I'm still alive down here! 
 Anyone? 
 Firefighter Diaz, do you copy? 
 Five by five, Cap. Over. 
 Chimney, report. 
 Read you loud and clear. 
 I've got eyes on Hen, who I can already tell screwed up my coffee. 
 Like hell. 
 One cinnamon coconut macchiato with a quad shot, half pump of vanilla. 
 And yes, my radio's working just fine. 
 Over. 
 There's no cinnamon! 
 Buck, sound off. 
 We have visitors, Cap. 
 Buck, the whole point of the test is to say it into the radio. 
 We have visitors, Cap. 
 Hey, did I pass? Over. 
 Close enough. 
 Dad! 
 Hey, guys. 
 Five-alarm school emergency. 
 He's supposed to tell Ms. Flores today what he's presenting for show and tell on Friday. 
 And so he suckered you into stopping here on the way. 
 You know I can't resist a cute face. 
 Okay. Show and tell. 
 I thought you were bringing in your new hamster. 
 Oh, the new hamster is old news. 
 Somebody's been snooping in your closet. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 It's a silver star 'cause my dad's a hero. 
 We don't need jewelry to know that. 
 Do you ever just wear it? 
 Never found an outfit to go with it. 
 Ooh, if I had a medal, I would never take it off. 
 We know. 
 You sure this is what you want to bring to school on Friday? 
 And you so you can tell the story. 
 Is that a story you can tell fourth-graders? 
 Not really. 
 Please, Dad. Please? 
 Okay. 
 I'll figure something out. 
 You promise? 
 Yes, yes, I promise. 
 You and me, Friday morning, telling "appropriate for fourth grader" war stories. 
 Love you. Love you too! 
 Come on, sweetie. 
 What do we got? 
 Missing boy. 
 Two kids playing in an open field. 
 Mom calls them home, only one shows up. 
 Sounded like maybe an abduction. 
 Road's not far away. Made sense. 
 But then I'm interviewing the mother, asking the usual questions, and I saw this. 
 Photo came with the house. 
 I didn't see a windmill when we pulled up. 
 Yeah, torn down years ago. 
 It used to power a water pump. 
 There's an abandoned well on the property. 
 Hayden! 
 Hayden? Hayden! 
 Hayden! 
 Hayden! 
 Hayden! Hayden? 
 Hayden! 
 Hayden! 
 Hayden! 
 Hayden? 
 Hayden! 
 Hey, guys! Over here! 
 Hey, give me a hand! 
 Cap, think we found something. 
 Hayden! 
 Hayden, can you hear me? 
 All right, we're gonna need a visual. 
 30 feet. 
 35 feet. 
 How far down does this thing go? 
 We're at 40 feet, Cap. Only got 50 feet of cable. 
 Can a boy even survive a fall that far? 
 Well, the well's narrow, so there's lots of friction to slow a fall. 
 But if he's really down there... 
 There. Right there. Hey, he's alive. 
 Look at the way he's pinned. 
 Arms forward, chest constricted, shallow breath. 
 45 feet. 
 At that depth, oxygen's an issue. 
 Cap, we gotta get a line of compressed air down there ASAP. 
 All right. You found him? 
 Is he... Okay, he's alive. 
 He's alive. Oh, my baby. 
 Okay, Commissioner, what are we working with? 
 The well sits on a water table that's about 50 feet down. 
 Fed by a reservoir here about a 1/2 mile over. 
 Right now, that boy is trapped at 45 feet. 
 He falls another 5, he drowns. 
 Can't pull him out from above. 
 No way to access him from the side of the reservoir. 
 There could be some intersecting feeder pipes down there, maybe some drainage tunnels, but frankly, this system predates our maps. 
 We have no way to know. 
 So how do we get him out? 
 We dig. 
 We set up a drill rig south of the well. 
 We use it to dig a parallel tunnel, wider, slightly deeper, then we go down. 
 Punch across by hand to access the well. 
 Hopefully, we can pull the boy out. 
 "Punch across by hand"? 
 Feels like a lot of distance to cover when you're 40-something feet down. 
 We drill our tunnel any closer and we risk compromising the integrity of the well pipe. 
 If it cracks, the whole thing could collapse. 
 Right on top of the kid. 
 Sergeant, we need you down at Division. 
 Copy that, Dispatch. 
 You heading to another call? Yeah. 
 But I'm leaving some officers behind for crowd control. 
 What crowd? 
 Word leaked out when they started calling around for a drill rig. 
 These are just the local stations. 
 If the story hits nationwide... 
 Like we don't have enough to worry about. 
 You gonna be okay? 
 I guess that depends on the forecast. 
 Now, what first responders are mostly worried about is a weather system moving into the area. 
 What was supposed to head north and vanish out to sea has now shifted course and is directly over Los Angeles County. 
 With torrential rains and gusty winds expected overnight, it's making an already complicated rescue potentially even more dangerous. 
 Okay, rig is ready to drill. 
 How's he doing? 
 Hasn't moved in a while. 
 Could've fallen asleep down there. 
 We're ready to put the radio down. 
 How far down before we lose the signal? 
 No way to know. 
 Go down 40 feet and we'll see what happens. 
 Copy that. 
 So I'll be able to talk to him? 
 Well, you might not be able to hear him but hopefully he'll hear you. 
 Just let him know you're here and help is on the way. 
 Radio's at 40 feet, Cap. 
 Okay, let's do this. Everybody off, all channels. 
 Hayden? 
 It's Mommy. 
 Buck, raise the radio. There's no signal. 
 Hayden, can you hear me? 
 Hayden. Hayden, please! 
 Please look up! 
 Okay, he can hear us now, Buck. 
 I know it's scary right now down there by yourself, but it's gonna be okay. 
 They're coming to get you. 
 Mom! 
 Baby, I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I can't do this. 
 I got this. 
 Hey, Hayden. 
 My name is Eddie. I'm a firefighter. 
 I'm here with your mother and a whole lot of other people. 
 We're all working to get you out of there. 
 Just stay calm, Hayden, okay? 
 It might get a little noisy. 
 Don't be scared. We'll be there soon. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank us later. 
 When we give you back your son. 
 We need to cover the mouth of the well STAT. 
 I need trenching to divert the rainwater away from the opening. 
 Buck, where are we at? 
 We're almost at 40 feet. 
 At the rate we're going, I'd say another hour, but this rain is really gonna slow us down. 
 Could be two, maybe even another three. 
 Shoring up as we go is killing us. 
 The ground's just too unstable. It's eating up time. 
 Time we don't have, Cap. 
 The boy's been down there ten hours already. 
 He's wet now and almost certainly hypothermic. 
 It's barely a mile away. We gotta pull the plug. 
 Hey, no, no, no. Come on, no way. 
 We got a five-story lightning rod sitting in an empty field out here. 
 It's still a mile away. 
 It gets any closer... I know. 
 Okay, get the winch and the harnesses and once we hit depth... 
 I'll go in. 
 I'm the one that was talking to him on the radio. 
 He knows my voice. 
 Makes sense that it's me. 
 Suit me up. I'm going down. 
 Are you insane? 
 I'm doing this for you. 
 You reenlisted without even discussing it with me. 
 How is that doing it for me? 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 Someone has to pay for all of this. 
 I mean, the house and the cars and now Christopher's illness. 
 The medical bills and therapists. 
 It is not an illness. 
 It's cerebral palsy, which you would know if you had been in that empty chair next to me when the doctor explained it all. 
 I was in Afghanistan, not Cancun. 
 Hey, you know what? 
 We'll just sell the house and the cars and I'll go back to work. 
 Maybe only part-time but... No, no. 
 Christopher is the priority right now. 
 You should stay home with him. 
 So should you! 
 Okay, we need you here. 
 I cannot do this without you. 
 I'm trying to provide for this family. 
 That's the reason I enlisted in the first place. 
 Again, without telling me. 
 I got pregnant and you signed up. 
 Surprise! 
 You keep saying that you didn't have a choice, but you're the one who keeps making these choices for the rest of us. 
 Great. 
 Christopher needs you. 
 Go get your son. 
 I'll get dinner. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy. 
 It's okay. You're okay. 
 Okay. 
 He wants you, not me. 
 You're still a stranger to him but you don't have to be. 
 If you were home... Shannon... 
 Eddie, I don't need a provider. 
 I need a partner. 
 You don't know what it's been like going through this alone. 
 You're not the only one that feels alone. 
 Come on, buddy. Hey, hey, hey. 
 Shannon! 
 Hey, hey, hey. No, it's okay, buddy. 
 It's all right, kid. Come on, please... 
 All right, extra oxygen in case you need it. 
 Water's rising fast down there. 
 Green light, full supply. Yellow light, two minutes. 
 I wanna see you topside before you see red. 
 Copy that. All right, we gotta go. 
 Okay, we're gonna lose comms, so here's the plan. 
 You have 30 minutes to dig yourself across, not one minute more. 
 After 30 minutes, you're gonna feel two strong tugs on your line, then we're pulling you out. 
 Same goes for you. 
 You find that boy first, you tug on that line twice. 
 That's it. We're done. 
 Come on. We're almost there. 
 All right, that's close enough. 
 Bring it up. 
 Let's bring him home. 
 Okay. 30 minutes. 
 See you then. 
 30 feet. 
 35 feet. 
 Cap, can you hear me? 
 Eddie, do you copy? 
 Tell me what's going on, Eddie. 
 I've reached depth. 
 Cap, I think he's out of range. 
 Don't know if you guys can hear me, but I'm preparing to punch through now. 
 Cap! 
 Yeah? 
 Now I've lost picture too. 
 Come on. I've lost the signal. 
 I think we need to run another line. 
 No time for that, Chim. 
 What? 
 Hayden! 
 Hey, it's me! Eddie! 
 I told you we were coming for you. 
 Are you doing okay down there, Hayden? 
 Cold. 
 I bet. 
 Hey, Cap. 
 I got eyes on Hayden. 
 He's fallen about... 
 Partially submerged. Water's rising fast. 
 I need more time. 
 I can't raise him on the radio. 
 Prep the rig. We're bringing him up. 
 No, Cap. Can't we give him more time? 
 He could have the kid or almost have him. 
 Or he could be suffocating in mud five stories belowground. 
 We're almost down to one minute. 
 I'm gonna reach down for you now, okay? 
 Try not to move. Let me do all the work. 
 There we go. There we go! 
 Almost there! 
 Time's up. Pull him out, now. 
 You're gonna be... 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 No! No! 
 Not now! 
 Hayden! 
 I lost the weight! 
 What does that mean? 
 I don't know! Something's wrong! 
 All right, 15 feet. 
 10, 5. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 He cut the damn line! 
 Chim, I want you to gear up. I'm sending you down. 
 Copy that. 
 Cap, I should be the one to go down. 
 So we can end up with two cut lines? 
 Camera's back. Still can't see. 
 Camera's underwater. 
 Hopefully it's just the camera. 
 Eddie. Eddie! 
 Eddie, can you hear me? 
 Shannon! It's hard to hear. 
 I'm sorry! We're moving out! 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Did you find out about your leave? 
 Diaz, we gotta go now. 
 Still waiting! 
 Mommy. It's okay. 
 It's okay, Chris. 
 Hey, what's going on? Is Chris... 
 No, no, it's... it's my mom. It's cancer. 
 What? 
 But she had a double mastectomy. 
 The odds are... No, it's different cancer. 
 It's endometrial carcinoma. Stage 3. 
 I can't hear you! 
 You're breaking up! 
 I have to go see her, Eddie! 
 We'll figure something out. 
 Maybe call my parents. They can... 
 Help. 
 Good to go. 
 Base, this is actual. 
 We're ten clicks out heading back with wounded. 
 Prep the med tents. 
 Wow! 
 From up here, it's kind of pretty. 
 Almost makes you forget you're flying through the Valley of Death. 
 Seriously, Mills? No one needs that. 
 There's guys dying back here. 
 I didn't name it! 
 All the dead guys did. 
 Dropped something. 
 What? 
 Damn it. 
 Clasp must've broken. Thanks. 
 St. Christopher medal. You religious? 
 Not really. 
 Wife gave it to me when our son was born. 
 Not convinced it has any magical powers. 
 Just reminds me of him. 
 Why I got this. 
 Anything happens to that, I got bigger problems. 
 Three girls? You must've been busy. 
 Incoming! 
 Break, break, break. 
 We're pinned down. We're taking fire. 
 Two clicks north of our last reported position. 
 Prepare for... 
 Wake up. Come on. 
 Chief, wake up. 
 We're under attack. Come on. 
 We gotta get everyone behind those rocks over there. 
 Copy. 
 Let's go! 
 Hey. Cover me. 
 Copy. 
 Let's go, buddy. Come on. 
 Hey, can you move? 
 Yeah. Get over there with Mills. 
 I'll cover you. 
 Diaz, I'm stuck! 
 I got you! 
 My leg. The bone broke through. 
 I gotta get this tourniquet on it. 
 Norwahl, stand down! 
 Norwahl, you gotta get out. 
 Norwahl, what the hell is wrong with you? 
 He's probably got a concussion. 
 Now! Norwahl! 
 Stand down! 
 Norwahl! 
 You okay, Diaz? 
 Got me in the shoulder. 
 Major, 6-4. What's your ETA? 
 Dust-off, 47. ETA six minutes. 
 We don't have six minutes! 
 Chief! Yeah? 
 You mobile? Affirmative. 
 Wake up! Diaz. 
 Keep low. Don't stop. 
 Diaz! Yeah? 
 I'm black on ammo! 
 I got you. 
 Go, go, go! 
 Where you going? 
 One more. Diaz, he's dead. 
 Yeah, he's coming home with us too. 
 Let's get you out, Greggs. 
 Diaz! Diaz, are you okay? 
 Patron saint of travelers. 
 To protect you and keep you safe. 
 We have a son. 
 
 
 
 I'm trying to provide for this family. 
 He wants you, not me. 
 You're still a stranger to him but you don't have to be. 
 We're almost home. 
 What happened? 
 A few bullets, broken bone, and a dislocated shoulder. 
 Heard you put on quite the show. 
 The chopper... my team... 
 Greggs is dead. 
 The others aren't, thanks to you. 
 Ma'am... 
 Please do not attempt to stand on ceremony right now. 
 Or at all. 
 Greggs... died on impact. 
 And you pulled him out anyway. 
 You got them all out, Staff Sergeant Diaz. 
 You got a bit more metal in you than you had before and no doubt a couple of new nightmares to add to the pile, but you're alive. 
 And so are they. 
 I need to call my wife. 
 You'll get your chance. 
 And everyone gets to go home for a spell. 
 Even Greggs. 
 You did good, Diaz. 
 Doesn't feel like enough. 
 Never does. 
 But they'll probably give you a medal for it anyway. 
 "For acts of gallantry and intrepidity in connection with military operations against the enemies of the United States." 
 We can all read the certificate, Ramon. 
 You don't have to recite it. 
 He's proud, Pepa. 
 Not every day your son comes home a hero. 
 I'm not a hero. 
 I just did what anybody else would do. 
 If that were true, everybody would be walking around with a silver star. 
 Honey, he can't drink this. He needs a straw and no ice. 
 Where are the juice boxes we bought? 
 I have no idea. 
 Well, maybe Daddy can go be a hero in the kitchen, huh? 
 Get a big old juice box. 
 Awesome! Good job. 
 Look at that. Yes. 
 What's wrong? 
 Apparently, I gave my son a beverage incorrectly. 
 Your mother? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm familiar with the tone. 
 Thanks. Yeah. 
 Have you given any more thought to California? 
 We could leave in the morning. Just you, me, and Christopher. 
 The open road. 
 We have a house full of people. 
 Half of 'em flew here to see us. 
 Now really isn't the best time. 
 Come on, you're finally home. 
 And you immediately want me to get into a car and drive 800 miles with a 6-year-old. 
 Your son. Yeah, I know that. 
 Can we please talk about this later? 
 Can I maybe just get a little damn time? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Take all the time you need. 
 All right. 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Dad. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 What's the matter? Where's Mommy? 
 She's gone. 
 What? 
 She's gone. 
 _ 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 All right, Hayden. 
 Come on, buddy. 
 Come on. 
 I got you. 
 I got you. 
 Okay, okay. 
 All right. That better? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What's that? 
 Thank you, buddy. 
 Eddie, are you down there? 
 We're almost home. 
 Eddie? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Thank God you're okay. 
 I was afraid I was gonna have to save your life. 
 No. 
 Hayden and I are just fine, right? 
 Come on, let's get you guys out of here. 
 Hayden, I'm gonna take you up to see your mom, okay? 
 I'm gonna send another line down for you. 
 Try not to cut this one. 
 All right. 
 Here we go, buddy. Ready? 
 There we go. All right. 
 Hold on tight! I am. 
 There we go, buddy. 
 Oh. 
 A second firefighter has now descended into the tunnel. 
 We're not certain why, but we hope... wait, there's movement! 
 Good job, buddy. 
 Hayden! Hayden! 
 Oh, Hayden. Here you go. 
 Let me get you two somewhere quiet. 
 I need to check him out. 
 Okay, right this way. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Eddie's fine. He just needs a ride. 
 All right. 
 I need to drop another 50 foot line to get my guy. 
 Buck, let's pull Eddie up and let's all go home. 
 Cap! Cap! 
 Hey, Chim. 
 Eddie! 
 Eddie! Eddie! 
 No! Eddie! 
 Eddie! No! 
 No! Eddie! 
 Cap, we gotta go dig. 
 We don't have a drill, Buck, and even if we could get another one up here, their access road is flooded. 
 Okay. Well, then, we dig by hand. 
 Not with all this rain. 
 We could trigger another collapse. 
 How long can he last down there? 
 We're talking 30 feet of wet earth coming right down on top of him. 
 Wait, you all think he's dead. 
 Nobody thinks that. 
 We just don't know how to get him out. 
 Nobody's giving up on him. Nobody. 
 We're gonna find him. 
 This is Diaz. 
 Can anybody hear me? 
 This is Eddie. 
 I'm alive. 
 I'm still alive down here! 
 I'm still alive down here! 
 Anyone? 
 You're in over your head, Edmundo. 
 I am doing the best that I can. 
 Well, that's what we're saying. You're killing yourself. 
 Working around the clock, three different jobs. 
 And you don't have time for what matters most. 
 Christopher. 
 And that's... that's why we think he should live with us permanently. 
 These jobs are just temporary. 
 It won't be like this forever. 
 You know I've applied to different fire departments. 
 I've got accepted to LA and Chicago. 
 Yes, where you'll be working 24-hour shifts, leaving Christopher with God knows who. 
 How is that any better for him? 
 Christopher needs consistency. 
 He already got cheated out of that when his own mother up and left us. 
 Hey, hey, hey, she didn't leave him. 
 She left me to take care of her dying mother. 
 So how about we cut her a little slack? 
 No, no. 
 She gave up on you and then she left her son. 
 I will always blame her for that. 
 But now you want me to leave him too? 
 How do you think that's good for him? 
 Eddie, he barely knows you. 
 You haven't been around most of his life. 
 I don't remember you being around much when I was his age. 
 I was working. So was I. 
 And maybe you regret those life choices now but you don't get to make up for lost time with your children by stealing mine. 
 Hey, hey! 
 No one is stealing Christopher. 
 Look, the reality is your father and I are the only constant in his life. 
 We have been there almost every single day since the day he was born. 
 You can't just take him away from the only stable thing he's got left. 
 He belongs with us. 
 Mom. Eddie. 
 I know how much you love your son. 
 That's why I know you are gonna do what is right for him. 
 Don't drag him down with you, Eddie. 
 Hey, what are you doing out here? 
 You guys sounded mad. 
 Oh, no one's mad at you, buddy. 
 They're mad at me. 
 Never heard them yell before. 
 Wow. 
 It's like we're talking about completely different people. 
 Hey, did you ever miss me when I was gone? 
 I miss you all the time. 
 You know, I was thinking about taking another trip. 
 And I was wondering, maybe, if you wanted to come with me. 
 Together. Together. 
 Really? Yeah. 
 I miss you all the time too, kid. 
 I'm never gonna leave you again. 
 There could be some intersecting feeder pipes down there, maybe some drainage tunnels, but frankly, this system predates our maps. 
 Feels like a lot of distance to cover when you're 40-something feet down. 
 Whoa, you got a kid? Christopher. 
 That's super adorable. 
 I love kids. 
 I love this one. 
 Welcome to the Los Angeles Fire Department, Firefighter Diaz. 
 What I miss most after leaving the army is the camaraderie. 
 Working shoulder to shoulder with a great team. 
 There's nothing better than the one I found here. 
 Well, that's what the 118 is. 
 The family we chose. 
 Shannon? 
 I'm leaving again. 
 I want a little more time. 
 We lost your mom, but we still got each other. 
 We're gonna be okay. 
 You're not like any other kid. 
 You're my kid. 
 Eddie, Christopher needs you. 
 Daddy. 
 I'm always gonna fight to come home to my family. 
 Okay, listen up. 
 Buck here is gonna get some thermal cams. 
 We are going to fan out and do a grid search. 
 Chimney is gonna have oxygen tanks and warming blankets standing by. 
 I wanna start at the well and go outward in concentric circles. 
 LAPD copters are on the way. 
 We'll use their thermal imaging to scan this wider area. 
 Try to pick up Diaz's heat signature. 
 Won't be easy. 
 Eddie? 
 Eddie! I'm pretty cold. 
 Eddie! 
 Hey. Hey. Get him up, Buck. 
 Come on, Eddie. Hey, hey, hey. 
 Let's get you checked out, buddy. 
 So we can get you home. 
 Yeah. 
 I got a big date Friday. 
 I can't miss it. 
 "And that is why the silver star is one of the highest honors a member of the Armed Forces can receive." 
 Thank you. 
 Good job, buddy. 
 Now tell 'em how you got it. 
 I was in a helicopter... helping a wounded soldier get back home. 
 And there was an accident. 
 Helicopter went down, ended up on fire... 
 Dad got everyone out. He saved them all. 
 I did my job. 
 I did my job. 
 Yeah? 
 Do you ever wear it? 
 I'm not really a jewelry kind of guy. 
 Except for this. 
 My St. Christopher medal. 
 So that's your good luck charm? 
 No. 
 He is.
