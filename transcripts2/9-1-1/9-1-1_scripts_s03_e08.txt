 NICOLE: I haven't seenthis much blood on the ice since a squirrel crawledinto the Zamboni. 
 Any idea what caused the accident? 
 NICOLE: Well, the Snowy Owls were finishing up their "Free in the Forest" bit. 
 Hansel and Gretel hit the ice for their breadcrumb schtick. 
 And, boom. Bloodbath on ice. 
 What's the story, Chim? 
 These two children are abandoned in the woods. 
 They come upon a gingerbread house where a witch entices them... 
 It was a multi-skater pile-up. 
 Most of the injuries are minorexcept for that guy. 
 He lost four digits. 
 We hit him with a localanesthetic to transport, still gottafind the fingers, though. 
 What about Hansel and Gretel? 
 Hansel took Gretel's bladeto the torso. 
 We propped him up to minimize the damage. 
 The skate's buried about 3 centimeters into his chest, barely missed the heart. 
 He doesn't have a heart.

 Think you can cut her foot out of the skate 
 -so we can transport them? -It'll probably be easy

 You thought I was leaving you behind, so you tried to hobble me, and it backfired. 
 The kicker, Boyd, I wasn't leaving. 
 I know! 
 That's why I broke up with you. 
 Because you were gonnaturn them down. 
 "Disney on Ice." The big leagues. 
 So they were fightingover her leaving. 
 Figured they'd shake it off once they hit the ice. 
 But then one of the Snowy Owls went full toe pick, and everyone hit the ice. 
 Did you say "toe pick"? 
 Hen, you ready? 
 Okay. 
 [inhales sharply] Ah. 
 You broke up with me so I wouldn't turn down 
 "Disney on Ice"?

 No. This is my dream.

 Where is Shane? 
 Don't go anywhere, Shane.

 I know you'll love it.
