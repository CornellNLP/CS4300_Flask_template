 Ride along with the original heroes of 9-1-1. 
 See all new episodes Mondays. 
 You've got one shot. 
 And check out our other Fox programs. 
 Deputy, Prodigal Son, and 9-1-1 Lone Star. 
 Good Lord Almighty. 
 Only on Fox. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 What can I get you? 
 I'm a sucker for a sidecar on a train. 
 Guys, this is not a subway car! 
 All right, sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Did you know at a Ukrainian wedding, the bride has to keep her shoes on? 
 'Cause otherwise the guests will steal them and drink wine out of them. 
 It's good luck. 
 Well, unless I missed a few stops, I'm pretty sure we are not about to roll into Kiev. 
 So... now I get to ask you the question that I ask everyone on here: why the train? 
 Spent a lot of time in Europe, fell in love with train travel. 
 Yeah, but this is Phoenix to LA. 
 It isn't exactly the Orient Express. 
 Well, Phoenix is home and LA used to be home, so. 
 Somebody waiting for you there? 
 No. 
 He stopped waiting for me a long time ago. 
 Summer camp? It's all he can talk about. 
 Some of the other kids from school are going. 
 It's only two weeks. 
 Time. Whoa, whoa. 
 Two weeks away from home? 
 Isn't Chris kind of young for that? 
 I mean, what if something happens? 
 What if he gets homesick? 
 I'm pretty sure I brought in the brochure so you guys can make me feel better about him going. 
 Clearly, you did not think that plan through to its logical conclusion. 
 I started going to sleepaway camp when I was 8. 
 I loved it. Camp Weegeewagen. 
 Eedee-idee-odee-ooh-hoo! 
 Looked forward to it every year. 
 Yeah, but Christopher's a city kid. 
 So was I. 
 St. Paul is a city. 
 If you say so. 
 I'm just trying to imagine trying to sell Denny on the idea of two weeks without the internet. 
 It's pretty exciting. 
 They even have this farm-to-fork program where the kids pick veggies and cook 'em for dinner. 
 That sounds a lot like child labor. 
 Okay. 
 Damn it! 
 Hmm. 
 I gotta get above a 511. 
 504 is pretty good. 
 Getting into medical school at this point in my life is hard enough. 
 I can't afford to be an average applicant. 
 Hey, there is nothing average about you. 
 You just started studying this. Give yourself a break. 
 Yeah. Hey, come on. 
 You are gonna rock the MCATs. 
 Hen, you're brilliant. 
 You don't need a test to prove that. 
 Bobby, why is your wife asking me if she could hold May's graduation party at my house? 
 Our living room is kind of under construction right now. 
 I'm in the hospital for four days and you two lose your damn mind! 
 I told you, Athena. 
 I was trying to make Bobby feel better. 
 What about making me feel better? 
 I'm the one with the broken arm and 50 people coming for a party in two weeks. 
 I didn't think we were still having a party, Mom. 
 You just got out of the hospital. 
 May, you are graduating from high school. 
 There will be a party and a cake and photographs with a fireplace that does not look like a pile of rubble. 
 Are you gonna finish taking it down? 
 'Cause I can help. No, no, no. 
 You will not. Your father broke it. 
 He's gonna fix it. 
 Absolutely. Okay? 
 I'm gonna go home, do some sketches, and I will come back here in the morning, okay? 
 Good, 'cause Hen says there's not enough room at her place for parking for all of our guests. 
 Okay, this is silly. 
 We really don't need to have a party. 
 Since when don't you wanna have a party? 
 Dad, don't you have a doctor's appointment in the morning? 
 Michael. 
 Your results are in. 
 You want me to come with you? 
 No. No, Athena, I got it. 
 The doctor is gonna go over the scans with me and, you know, then we'll know what's... what's next. 
 Good news. 
 That's what's next. 
 True that. 
 It's good. 
 I did a lot of research, you know, on the dos and don'ts of making a victim impact statement. 
 I totally believe that. 
 It's very thorough. 
 It's terrible, isn't it? No. 
 Look, when I read this, I know exactly what Greg did to you. 
 What I don't understand is how you... feel about any of it. 
 Does it matter? 
 What do you think? 
 I mean, is this really what you wanna say to him? 
 I think the judge would discourage the use of curse words. 
 Okay, so then... find new words. 
 Your words. 
 Look, this moment is about you. 
 It's not about what you're supposed to say. 
 It should come from your heart. 
 I am so sorry. 
 That... 
 That had nothing to do with you, I promise. 
 I am trying not to be offended. 
 I just need to refill. 
 Really? 
 Really? 
 'Scuse me. 
 Look, man, self-expression is kind of my right, okay? 
 Not when it infringes on my right to peace and quiet. 
 Look, I got a huge show at the Roxy, all right? 
 I don't care! Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Why don't we hit the pause button here, all right? 
 I think a little peace and quiet would be a great idea all around. 
 She doesn't have a pause button. 
 That's not good. 
 Come on, man. She's a kid. 
 What the hell is that? 
 Now. 
 Oh... ha-ha! Hey! 
 There you go! 
 Awesome, Dad. You did it. 
 Not bad, right? Yeah. 
 Not bad at all. 
 Hey! Slow down! 
 5! 
 Morons. Kill somebody. 
 So... now that you got it running, what's the plan? 
 Sneaking out when I'm not looking? 
 Why would we do that? We've only been here... 
 Three nights! 
 Three nights for which I have not been paid. 
 Look, I thought we talked... 
 Three nights is my limit. 
 I want you out of here. 
 You mean now? 
 Get yourself gone, or I will have you towed. 
 Hey, this is... this is the last of it. 
 There's a food bank not too far from here. 
 I'll... I'll hit it in the morning. 
 Hand me a rag. 
 Thanks. 
 Stay inside, Milo. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Dude. 
 You cannot do this to us. 
 You told me I had a week to find a job. 
 I never said that to you. 
 You pay, you stay. Those are the rules. 
 Look, I came in here because a son should never see his father have to beg. 
 But I'm still always telling him, "Just keep your head up. 
 "Just keep your head up because if you don't, you won't see all the good things that are coming." 
 I don't know what's next. 
 What's next? 
 What's next is reality! 
 Oh, God! 
 Milo! 
 Are those all your Realtor Rapist files? 
 Please do not call him that. 
 Yes. 
 I asked Lou to drop 'em off so that I could be ready for my meeting with Dr. Sanford. 
 The victims' advocate? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Going to trial, testifying in court, it can be overwhelming, so... she's gonna help all of them get through it. 
 Okay. Ooh, that must be her. 
 Can I get the door? 
 Oh, I'm fine. 
 I still got one good arm. 
 Ah, Dr. Sanford. 
 Athena Grant. Come in. 
 Thank you. And it's Kara, please. 
 Although I'm sure my mom would want you to keep the Dr. part. 
 It is so good to meet you, Sergeant Grant. 
 Oh, Athena, please. Come in. 
 Pardon our dust. 
 While I was out, my home turned into one of those cable remodeling shows. 
 Surprise! It's still not done. 
 Oh, it's a lovely home. 
 Well, I set us up in here. 
 You have the case files for the other victims. 
 Oh, yes. 
 I'm sure you have specific questions, but I thought it would be easier to just go through all of them. 
 Great. 
 So... where do you wanna start? 
 Pacific West 1135. 
 We were heading from Phoenix into Union Station. 
 We've crashed somewhere close to the LA County line. 
 Okay, so how many... 
 There are multiple injuries. 
 This is a mass casualty situation. 
 You've gotta send out every available RA unit. 
 We need USAR for search and rescue, LAPD for traffic control. 
 We're gonna need a mobile command center. 
 I'll call them now. Okay. 
 It seems like you've done this before. 
 Yeah, but I was on your side of the line. 
 I used to be a 9-1-1 dispatcher. 
 Milo! 
 Milo, can you hear me? 
 Captain Bobby Nash. Captain Janet Reese. 
 More houses are en route. Search dogs as well. 
 The debris field is pretty far and wide. 
 We've had our hands full with all the passenger cars down here, but there are reports that folks are trapped up there. 
 We just can't get to 'em yet. 
 Buck, Eddie, go have a look. 
 See if there's a way to secure that car so we can get those people out. 
 Is USAR on the way? 
 Dispatch assures me a heavy rescue is coming. 
 All right, guys, let's gear up. Let's go! 
 Please, if you can just let me up into the car. 
 Please! I've gotta get up there. 
 Ma'am, I'm sorry. We can't let you inside. 
 It's too dangerous. I know it's dangerous. 
 I need to get up in that car. I hear you. I'm sorry. 
 Wait, are you from the 118? 
 Yeah. 
 Abby? 
 Buck. 
 Wait, you were on the train. Yeah. I've gotta... 
 We need to get you checked out. 
 No, no, no. I'm fine. 
 I need to get up there. What? No, that's crazy! 
 No, no, Abby, Abby, stop! 
 I'm trying to find somebody! 
 Okay. Well, just tell us who. 
 We'll go... My fiancé! 
 He fell asleep and I went to the bar. 
 Okay. Can you give us a description? 
 That's him. 
 We were in that top car right there, all the way in the back. 
 We'll find him. 
 Um... what's his name? 
 Sam. 
 Egan. 
 Sam. 
 I got it. 
 Thank you, Buck. 
 Oh. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 We'll bring him back to you. 
 I promise. 
 We got somebody. 
 Cap, be advised. 
 Another black tag up here about halfway. 
 Copy that. 
 Sam! 
 Sam! Sam, can you hear me? 
 Sam. 
 Hey, Sam. 
 How you feeling? 
 It hurts... hurts when I breathe. 
 Please. 
 My fiancée. 
 She's on the train. 
 Yeah, hey, hey. She's okay. 
 Cap, I got a passenger pinned up here. 
 Looks like the support beam from the observation deck broke through the floor. 
 Need you to send up the jaws, okay? 
 Copy that. Coming right up. 
 We got you, Sam. 
 Help is on its way. 
 We need jaws and the ram. On it, Cap. 
 These are the last of the walking wounded from the bottom of this car. 
 What's the word from up top? 
 Two dead, one trapped so far. 
 Captain Nash, search dog detail just landed. 
 Can you spare a couple medics? 
 All right, Hen, Chim, go with them. 
 Are you sure, Cap? 
 We need all the paramedics we have on the ground. 
 What about up there? 
 I got it. 
 You got it, Buck? 
 All right. 
 He's got a collapsed lung from the blunt force. 
 O2 levels are dropping. 
 I can relieve the pressure, but we gotta move this beam off him. 
 Still too heavy. 
 It's not gonna budge. 
 All right. Let's try the hydraulic ram. 
 Got it, Buck? Yeah. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! 
 We got somebody else! 
 How you doing? 
 My side really hurts. 
 I'm gonna take a peek. 
 Oh. 
 Force of the crash pushed her leg up into her torso. 
 What? 
 It's gonna hurt a little bit. 
 All right. 
 There's still a pulse in her foot. 
 Blood's still pumping to her. 
 All right. That's a beam. 
 Come on. Be right back, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 They're both trapped by the same beam. 
 We take the pressure off of him and we're squeezing her. 
 Which one has the better shot? 
 Injuries are different. 
 The risk is the same. 
 What are we saying? We gotta pick who we save? 
 I'm saying I don't think we can save 'em both. 
 Now, it'll be hard on Alexis because she's still struggling with admitting that it even happened. 
 Well, it's not uncommon for victims to distance themselves from the crime. 
 Yeah. Now, Michelle. 
 I think she'll be great on the stand but she is the one that I worry about the most. 
 Why is that? 
 All of her statements are peppered with, "I should've known." 
 "I should have realized." 
 She blames herself. 
 Thinks if she had done something differently, maybe it wouldn't have happened. 
 Yeah. Right. 
 I can't help but notice that there's a file missing from this table. 
 His attack on me was nothing like what he did to these other women. 
 Now, your priority should be them. 
 I don't think it's fair to compare traumas. 
 And from what I read, his attack on you was pretty brutal. 
 Well, it happened pretty fast and I don't remember most of it. 
 Everyone says I'm lucky that I don't. 
 They're wrong. 
 Yes, sometimes the brain's way of protecting us is to block out painful memories. 
 But I've been doing this a long time and I have never had anyone feel better because they didn't know what happened to them. 
 You were never here to talk about these other women. 
 Were you? 
 I'm here for you. 
 Well, I'm not ready. 
 I'll leave this here for when you are. 
 All right, hold on. Here we go. 
 Milo! 
 Help! 
 Sir, are you hurt? 
 No. I'm looking for my son. 
 Hey, do you know where he was when the train crashed? 
 He was in the RV. 
 I left him when I was talking to Rory. 
 All right, tell us about your son. 
 He's 15. 
 Black hair, green shirt. 
 Do you have anything with his scent on it? 
 Maybe help us track him? 
 No, I don't. 
 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Milo used this to clean his hands, but it's gotta have antifreeze or coolant on it. 
 That's okay, Richard's trained to track only human scents. 
 Chemicals don't confuse him. What you got buddy? 
 What you got? 
 All right, Sam. This is for the pain. 
 Keep him talking. 
 It's her... or me, isn't it? 
 No. 
 No, that's not what we do. 
 So tell me about your fiancée. 
 When's the wedding? 
 June. 
 She wants to wait... till the girls are done with school. 
 You're a father. 
 Yeah. 
 Tess... 
 Natalie. 
 Good boy, Richard. Good boy. 
 Milo. 
 Sir, stand back so we can do our work, okay? 
 Milo, can you hear me? 
 Yeah. 
 Dad? Right here, son. 
 We're gonna get you out. 
 You're lying very still, Milo. 
 Is it because you're afraid or because you're having trouble moving? 
 I don't think I can move. 
 What's happening? Is something wrong with him? 
 Just give us a minute to take a look, okay? 
 Pulse is strong. Milo, can you wiggle your toes? 
 Normal reaction. 
 C1 vertebra's intact, so I'm guessing it's not a spinal... 
 But I can't seem to locate the occiput ligaments. 
 Atlanto-occipital dislocation? 
 I've seen it in car accidents. 
 Never seen someone still talking after. 
 All right, Command, we need an extraction team on the north side of train car two with a straight shot to a medevac copter. 
 And contact the children's hospital. 
 Have them prep the neurosurgery OR. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's going on? 
 She said it wasn't a spinal... Stand back. 
 It's called an internal decapitation. 
 His spine is intact. 
 It's just no longer connected to his skull. 
 But he's alive. He's talking. 
 As long as his spine remains intact, he's still got a good shot of surviving this. 
 We just need to get him to a hospital so the surgeons can reattach his ligaments, okay? 
 We need to find a way to cool our saline, preserve as much nerve and tissue as possible. 
 Right. I saw an ice cooler over here. 
 I'll get some ice. 
 Okay, I'm calling it. 
 We start with the girl, we get her out. 
 Copy that. No. 
 It's gonna crush Sam's other lung. 
 He's gonna die. I am aware of that. 
 The protocol dictates that we save whomever has the better chance and Eddie's saying that's the girl. 
 No. 
 Her vitals are stronger. 
 He's starting to decompensate. 
 If we have to choose... We do. 
 We can't move that steel beam. 
 Okay. Okay, you're right. 
 The beam is steel. 
 But the skin on this thing, the skin is stainless. 
 That's much thinner. 
 I could go outside, I could cut a piece out, pull the girl through, and that will buy us enough room to save Sam. 
 No. This car hasn't been secured. 
 That's why we're working on the inside. 
 If this thing topples, we can ride it down, but if you're on the outside... 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I will be crushed by 100 tons of train car, and I know that is a lot heavier than a fire truck. 
 But Bobby... Buck, stop. 
 All right, I know you made a promise. 
 What promise? 
 To his fiancée. 
 I promised I would bring him back to her. 
 What? 
 To Abby. 
 His fiancée's Abby. 
 Okay. 
 No. Look, it's not just about her. 
 Okay, he's a father. He has two daughters. 
 Stop. You're too close to this. This is too risky. 
 Well, I am willing to take the risk. 
 
 
 
 It's not yours to take. 
 You can't just rush into any dangerous situation and assume it's gonna be okay. 
 'Cause sometimes it's not and I am tired of being on the wrong side of those hospital visits. 
 Bobby. I am not Athena. 
 What did you just say to me? 
 Enough. 
 We don't have time for this. 
 Buck, come on. 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 Abby, are you with my dad? 
 I'm not right now. What's going on? 
 Are you in LA yet? 
 Dad hasn't texted. 
 He always texts. 
 I know. I know. 
 He does. 
 There was an accident on the train. 
 What? Oh, my God! What happened? 
 But I don't want you to be worried because your dad is in the best hands. 
 Is he okay? 
 Kay, we have to secure that car We got injured people inside and it's been creaking like it's ready to go. 
 How we doing, Sam? 
 Okay. 
 How's the girl? 
 She's hanging in there. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 For what? 
 That you got hurt. 
 You were really nice to me. 
 Say, you're gonna miss your gig. 
 Neither of you guys are missing anything. 
 We're getting you out. 
 All right, send up the basket! 
 All right, your turn, Sam. 
 On three. 
 One, two, three. 
 Almost there, Sam! 
 All right. 
 It's gonna be a little cold. 
 Afraid he's used to it. 
 We aren't living in the RV by choice. 
 What are you talking about, Dad? 
 We're on an adventure. 
 Hey, what do we always say? 
 Maybe not the best thing to say right now, kid. 
 Keep your head up 'cause... 
 What just happened? 
 The automatic signals from Milo's brain stopped telling him to breathe. 
 We need to put a tube down his throat. 
 Administering succinylcholine. 
 This will stop the gag reflex. 
 I'll hold him steady. All right. 
 All right. 
 Easy. 
 Inflating balloon to keep steady. 
 Okay, switch. 
 Abby? Is she here? 
 She's down there waiting for you, Sam. 
 Medevac's here. 
 Airway's patent. 
 Okay, what does that mean? 
 It means he's gonna be okay. 
 Because she's brilliant. 
 Way to go, Wilson. 
 You talk to the girls? 
 You're so amazing and brave. 
 They're gonna be really proud of you. 
 Hey. Hey, man. 
 Thank you. 
 Buck. 
 Thank you. 
 You're Buck? 
 Good to meet you, Sam. 
 You okay? 
 What's next? 
 I told you I don't remember much about being attacked. 
 It was behind me, and then all of a sudden, it gets hazy. 
 The next clear memory I have is being in the back of the ambulance and the look on my husband's face. 
 I thought I was dying because he thought I was. 
 But you didn't. 
 You survived. 
 But I shouldn't have. 
 He had me dead to rights. 
 Came up behind me. 
 I didn't even know he was there. 
 I've been a police officer for 30 years. 
 I love my job and I'm good at what I do because I've always been able to trust my gut. 
 But now? 
 You're doubting yourself. 
 I should've called for backup before I went inside. 
 Maybe. 
 But that doesn't mean that what he did to you was your fault. 
 Maybe not, but I scared the hell out of my family and myself. 
 And now I'm left feeling like I can't trust my instincts anymore. 
 How the hell am I supposed to go back out there feeling like this? 
 You're not going back out there tomorrow. 
 It'll take time to heal. 
 But if that part of me never does? 
 And that's why I was struggling. 
 I couldn't figure out what to say to you. 
 How to make you understand what you did to me and to the people I care about. 
 But then I realized I don't have to. 
 Because I'm gonna walk out of this courthouse and I'm gonna have some drinks with friends and you're gonna go sit in a box. 
 Every morning, you will wake up and think about why you're there. 
 You will have to think of me. 
 But I can choose to never think about you again. 
 Are you sure? 
 I don't like to brag, but I'm pretty good at reading these things. 
 The tumor has shrunk by almost 30%. 
 Congratulations. 
 This is... 
 This is really happening. 
 It's a miracle. 
 You know, I think Dr. Burman might be offended by that word. 
 Thank you so much. 
 But I am feeling pretty miraculous myself. 
 I know it's not a clean bill of health or anything, but... 
 It's good news, Michael. Be happy. 
 When do you wanna tell the kids? 
 Tonight. 
 You know, we can tell 'em together. 
 Okay, what time? 
 Uh, you know, I'm not sure. 
 There's something that I need to do. 
 I'll call you later. 
 Hold the elevator! 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 So where were we? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Thanks for meeting me. 
 How's... how's Sam? 
 He's good. 
 They're expecting a full recovery. 
 Good. He seems like a great guy. 
 He said the same thing about you. 
 And I will never be able to thank you enough for what you did. 
 Just doing my job. That's all. 
 I'm sorry that you had to find out about it this way. 
 I had actually wanted to talk to you about everything while I was in town. 
 That's what you're sorry for? 
 When did you know that you were... leaving me for good? 
 Well... 
 You know, was it... 
 Was it in Morocco or Paris or Dublin or... 
 Or did you know when we were at the airport and I was kissing you good-bye and promising you that I would wait for you? 
 Did you know then that you were never coming back to me? 
 I thought I would. 
 Look, I was a person whose life revolved around everybody else's problems. 
 I had no identity other than... the people that I was helping. 
 My 9-1-1 calls, my dying mother. 
 I just had no sense of self. 
 I had to leave everything that I knew so that I could remember who I actually am. 
 And you did, right? 
 I mean, you did remember, but... 
 You still didn't come home. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I think I was afraid that if I came back, I would become that person again. 
 Because I missed you. I wanted to see you. 
 But I didn't trust myself. 
 Because being here, being with me, you might lose yourself again? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm glad to see you happy, Abby. 
 You deserve it. 
 Oh, we are so proud of you, baby. 
 My little girl, ready to start a new chapter. 
 You have your whole life ahead of you. 
 So do you, Dad. 
 All right, all right! 
 To the graduate of 2020! 
 Turn it up! Turn it all the way up! 
 Share the spice of life Baby, slice it right We're gonna groove tonight All right, buddy, your turn. What do you wanna say? 
 "May your dreams come true, May." 
 Good. That's... that's really good! 
 All right Let this groove set in your shoes So you excited about USC? 
 I know your mom certainly is. 
 Actually... do you have a minute? 
 There was something I wanted to talk to you about. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Theoretically, Athena's gonna be able to use this to light whatever that is? 
 Right. It's a firepit. 
 A firepit or a money pit? 
 You know, it's gonna be great. 
 Glide like a 747 What is... It's greatness. 
 You don't see the... greatness? 
 No. 
 You little brat! 
 I'm gonna get you. 
 Let this groove light up your fuse Ooh! 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 It is a great party. Mm. 
 Well, May deserves it and I had a little time on my hands. 
 Well, you'll be back to work soon enough. 
 It's been 30 years since I've been a civilian. 
 I'm not sure you're ready to have me at home all the time. 
 I think I could get used to it. 
 Not that I'm gonna have the chance. 
 I know you can't wait to get back out there. 
 Yeah. 
 Looking from a window above Can I help? 
 It's like a story of love Can you hear me? 
 People tend to fear the unknown. 
 We look ahead, but we also look away. 
 Afraid of what terrible things might be coming down the line. 
 All I needed for another day We survive because we don't face our fear alone. 
 We band together and we find strength in numbers. 
 Sometimes when I think of her name When it's only a game Truthfully, the not-knowing, that's not something we should fear. 
 It's something we should embrace. 
 It's what makes this all such a great adventure.
