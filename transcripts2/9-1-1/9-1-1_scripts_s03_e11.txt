 Ride along with the original heroes of 9-1-1. 
 See all new episodes Mondays. 
 You've got one shot. 
 And check out our other Fox programs. 
 Deputy, Prodigal Son, and 9-1-1 Lone Star. 
 Good Lord Almighty. 
 Only on Fox. 
 I can't believe I let you talk me into this. 
 I'm your mother. 
 I don't talk you into things. 
 I tell you what to do. 
 And because I was in laborfor 18 hours, you do it. 
 I don't see how that obligates me to fall 30,000 feet out of a plane with you. 
 Oh, please. It's 15,000 tops. 
 We made a pact to spend more mother-daughter time together. 
 Bucket listing out of a plane is not a mother-daughter activity. 
 It's a bet you make with gravity. 
 Lizzy, this is important to me. 
 Life is short. 
 Gotta grab the bullby the horns. 
 I swear, Dad dying made you weird. 
 It's not like I have grandkidsto keep me busy. 
 Wonder if our instructoris single. 
 Stefan... Mom! 
 Is that our plane? 
 ♪ We're approaching altitude. We ready? 
 Ready! Time to seize the day! 
 Okay, ladies. 
 I'll count it down. 
 Oh, my God! No! 
 Baby, no! 
 It looks likehis parachute is snagged on something. 
 He's caught underneaththe airplane. 
 He hasn't said anything on the radio. 
 Might not be conscious. 
 Let's hope not, for his sake. 
 That's a memory he's not gonna wanna savor. 
 We got us a concussion, possible spinal injury. 
 And he's getting buffeted by turbulence under the plane. 
 We're gonna need to treat him for exposure. 
 Yeah, we haven't talked about how we're getting him down. 
 How's the leg? 
 Uh, screws are out. Feeling great. 
 All right. 
 Dispatch, this is Captain 118. 
 Can you get me in that pilot's ear? 
 Poor Stefan. He was so young! 
 Mom, he's not dead. You heard the pilot. 
 He's still hangingfrom underneath the plane. 
 Oh, baby, planes can't fly forever. 
 Wild One, this is Captain Nash, LAFD. 
 Do you copy? Yes, sir, I do. 
 Hope you guys figured out how to land this without killing my friend. 
 What kind of headwind reading you getting today? 
 Around 10 knots. 
 I need you to turn into that wind and make an approach. 
 I'm sorry, you want me to land? 
 With Stefan still under the plane? 
 I just need you to get low enough so that we can free you. 
 Wait, where are you guys gonna be? 
 Right below you. 
 All right, Cap, we got him. 
 Coming in hot behind us. 
 Okay, hang tight and keep your hands ready. 
 Wild One, we're in position. 
 I see you. Too high, Cap! 
 Tell him to drop it! 
 Keep dropping. 
 Lower. 
 Damn it, Cap! We missed him! 
 Too high and too fast! 
 Can you drop your speed any lower? 
 Any slower and we're gonna stall. 
 What about your flap? 
 I do that, there's no going back. 
 I'm gonna have to put her down. 
 Got it. Last shot. 
 Buck, Eddie, we've got one more shot at this. 
 Okay, Wild One, put her down. 
 All right, Cap, we see him! 
 Coming in hot behind us! 
 That's it, that's it! Another 150 feet! 
 Lower, lower, lower! Keep it steady. 
 That's it. We're almost there. 
 Come on. All right, Cap. 
 Keep it steady. 
 Right there, okay. Come on. 
 Go, go, go! 
 ♪ 
 We got him! 
 Is he gonna be all right? 
 He's a little beat up, but I think he'll fly again. 
 Just not sure he's gonna want to. 
 Hope this'll be the endof your flying. 
 And your matchmaking. 
 Uh, are you boys single? 
 ♪ 
 So what's going on? 
 Every time you guyssit us down like this, it seems to be bad news. 
 No, it's not. 
 We just wanted to give you guysand update on what's happening with your dad. 
 Right, um, I saw my doctor, and the good news is the tumor didn't grow, okay? 
 Now, but the bad news is, it... it didn't shrink, either. 
 So what now? 
 So your dad is gonna have surgery. 
 Brain surgery? 
 Yeah. 
 But I thought that you didn't wanna do surgery. 
 That's why you did the radiation. 
 Well... 
 Surgery can be complicated. 
 That's why they wanted to try the treatments first, and now they just wanna try something else. 
 That's all. 
 So they just take it outand then you're cured, right? 
 W-well, hopefully yes. 
 You know, they'll take out as much as possible and then maybe do more radiation after that. 
 Wait, they're gonnacut open your brain and they might not evenget all of it? 
 Yeah, May, no. 
 This is the best option right now. 
 That's what they said aboutthe radiation. 
 Look, look. 
 Your dad has a great team of doctors and we're gonna trust them, and we are gonna stay positive. 
 Yes, yes. Your... your mother is right. 
 Okay, we're gonna carry on business as usual. 
 We are not gonna let this stop us from doing the things that we know we need to do, okay? 
 Like studying for your math test. 
 We still got that deal, right? 
 Oh, man, come on. 
 A-minus or above, it's you, me, and GameStop. 
 And your Gold Card. 
 What? I'm just kidding. 
 And my Gold Card. 
 Great, I'm gonnago study right now. 
 ♪ Bone has fusednicely where the screws were, and there's minimal scar tissue. 
 I... I feel good, Doc. 
 I mean, I was... I was standingon top of a moving fire truck the other day. Not even a twinge. 
 I'm gonna pretend that I did not hear that part. 
 I'm not interested in operatingon your other leg. 
 ♪ So what about the clots? 
 Scans are clear. 
 No sign of clots since we took you off of the blood thinners. 
 I think those screws were the source of your problem. 
 Uh, so that's it? 
 They're gone and I... I don'tneed to see you anymore? 
 As long as you don't get crushed by another fire truck. 
 Whoa, come on. Too soon, Doc. 
 Just... Sorry. 
 Mr. Buckley, it is my pleasure to give you a clean bill of health. 
 So go get dressed and get out of here. 
 Um, well, thank you. 
 For everything. 
 Um, no offense, but I hope I neversee you again. 
 Hey, you never know. 
 Really? 
 I don't understand why the water. 
 All the ingredients I get, but who puts water in meatballs? 
 It helps the meatballs not turn into tiny little rocks, but they did not say how much water. 
 ♪ What are you doing? Birthday rules. 
 No help from the guest of honor. 
 But it feels weird justwatching and not contributing. 
 I'm not really a "woman, make me food" kind of guy. 
 Okay, fine. If you wanna help, figure out how long the meatballs need to cook in the sauce, because I would hate for your birthday dinner to kill us.

 20 years old, and I've never met my brother. 
 Well, half-brother. 
 I'm sorry about your birthday. 
 If I had known, I would have brought you something. 
 Besides myself. 
 It's okay. 
 I wouldn't expect you to know. 
 Clearly, Pop didn't. 
 All he could talk aboutwas you running away from home. 
 I did not run away. 
 Yes, I ran away, but from him. 
 You know how he is. 
 Not really. 
 He's suffocating. 
 It's not enough to finish university early. 
 Now I must decide on a graduate school, except when he says decide, he means acquiesce. 
 So what do you want to do? 
 No idea. 
 Finally, I'm starting to seea family resemblance. 
 That's why I came here. I knew you'd understand. 
 Yeah, I'm not really sure I'm the right role model for you finding a career path. 
 Your brother is being modest. 
 He saves people all day long, and he's really good at it. 
 It's time I stopped living in Father's shadow. 
 I need to strike out on my own. 
 And land on my couch? 
 Only if it isn't any trouble.

 A few weeks of freedom, he'll probably come home on his own. 
 He's 20, and I was making my own decisions long before that age. 
 Was it, though? 
 You never even tried. 
 And by the way, I haven't failed.
