Best we can do now is control traffic and hope to avoid more accidents.  Damn probie jinxed us. He used the Q-word.  Jinxed?  You don't believe in that stuff.  No.  But they do.  And when they hear the Q-word, they get squirrely, then they make mistakes, they forget to latch the front end of the engine, or they accidentally trigger the fire suppression system.

Edmundo, um...  how are you?  Looks like I should be asking you that.  Did you get injured in the accident?  Drinking hot coffee while walking.  Usually not dangerous, but some guy bumped into me when the accident happened.  - Yeah. - Burned myself pretty good.  Mind if I take a look at that?  Sure.  Ice is really bad for burns.  Let's see.  Ooh, okay.  That firefighter gave it to me.  - Told me to keep it cool. - Which firefighter?  Um, he was just here. Had     on his helmet.  There's another unit here?  Well, he should've known better.  Keep it dry and clean.  - How's Christopher? - Good.  Yeah, adjusting to remote classes.  I assumed that's why I haven't seen you around this year.  You were looking for me?  - Uh... - (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC)   Christopher said you weren't one of his teachers this year.  That was the hardest part about quitting.  I miss the kids.  I just finished my doctorate.  Now, I'm over at Adams Elementary.  Vice principal.  Ooh, impressive. Congrats.  - Thank you. - What made you want to quit?  You're so good at being a teacher.  Well, having a PhD gives me more options.  And I'm never not gonna be a teacher.  It's in my blood.  Sounds like being a firefighter.  (SIGHS) Wow.  Your job looks really good on you.  Thank you.  Uh, you see that guy from the    , get his name.  Could've done more harm than good with that ice.  I guess it's my lucky day, then.  - (CHUCKLES) - Good thing you found me.

Two people stuck in an elevator.  They didn't even need medical attention or anything.  Don't say it, Edmundo.  How can I not?  Y'all acting like a bunch of  viejas.    There is no curse.  Oh, he's so definitive now.  Ooh, sure is windy. You guys feel that?  Nobody is saying you have to believe in curses.  Just maybe don't tempt fate.  How's that not the same thing?  It was a normal call.  (CLEARS THROAT) Went like clockwork.  Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.  You notice how you never hear anyone say, "wham, bam, thank you, sir"?  It doesn't rhyme.  Or maybe all that whammin' and bammin' is nothing to write a thank you note about.  EDDIE: (CHUCKLES) The point is I think this proves that the whole jinx thing is a little silly and we should be all done with it.  (LOUD BANG AND ELECTRICITY ZAPPING)  CHIMNEY: Whoa!   ♪♪    Whoa.   ♪♪    CHIMNEY: Hey, Cap.  Did a live power pole just fall on the engine?  I believe it did, Chimney.   - (ELECTRICITY ZAPPING)    - Right.  No curse here.   (OMINOUS MUSIC)     (CAR HORNS HONKING)     (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC)    - Hey. - Hey.  Heard you got a distress call.  Yeah, Engine    .  Wind blew a power pole over on top of their engine.  Oh, my God. Anybody hurt?  No injuries reported.   (NOTIFICATION CHIMES)  Gotta say, the calls today have been really weird.  You know, I actually checked to make sure it wasn't a full moon tonight.  Oh, no. That's not for another four days.  I've already scheduled myself to be off.  I thought we weren't allowed to do that.  Pays to be the underboss.   (NOTIFICATIONS CHIMING)    Who are you texting with?  Chimney and Buck. They're in the engine.  - And? - They're fine.  But Chimney's asking if I can send someone over with two bells and some bay leaves?  Oh.  He's trying to remove a curse.  - It's a whole thing. - (LAUGHS)   - (ELECTRICITY ZAPPING)    - CHIMNEY: Aha!  It is a real thing.  Okay, so we have to move our hands this kind of motion and ring the bells...  nine times.  Nine in total or nine for each of us?  It's unclear.  I think maybe we should all do it just to make sure we lift the curse completely.  Well, is it actually a curse?  I know we called it that, but technically, I think it's a jinx.  What's the difference?  Well, I feel like a curse implies that a person put a hex on you and a jinx is more like a general angering of the gods.  All right, I got it. Here we go.  - How to appease the gods. - CHIMNEY: Okay, wait.  So is a hex and a curse the same thing?  EDDIE: By that, you mean both are totally made up and not real?  Yes.  What more proof do you need, Eddie?  We are trapped in a death box.  Thousands of volts of electricity coursing through every book and cranny.  Any one of us could literally get fried like that.  Or we just don't touch any doors or windows until help arrives and nobody gets fried.  With or without a curse... or jinx, whatever.  All I can find is some kind of human or animal sacrifice.  I'm not really down with that.  Do you guys not hear yourselves right now?  BUCK: Do you?  It's like the universe is screaming at you and you refuse to listen.  The universe does not scream.   (ELECTRICITY WARBLING AND ZAPPING)     ♪♪    Oh, there are clearly forces at work here.  Forces beyond my control and your control...  EDDIE: That's it.  That's the difference between you and I.  I don't worry about things that I can't control.  BUCK: Sure, but you can say you don't worry about things you can't control, but can you at least acknowledge that something is controlling the things that you can't control?  Like what? Gremlins? Boogeyman?   Santa Muerte?    Look, we've had a crappy day.  It happens.  But it didn't happen because of a curse or a hex or because someone said the word qu...  BOBBY: Hey, hey, don't!  (CHUCKLING) Come on, Bobby.  You really can't believe in all this.  You know, Cap, you have been pretty silent today     about all this jinx stuff.  Yeah. Suspiciously silent.  Yeah, Cap. Come on. Where do you stand?  Jinx or no jinx?  Aren't we all a little superstitious?  People don't like to walk under ladders, some buildings don't have a   th floor, we bless people after they sneeze.  Some of us even wear a good luck charm around their neck.  That's not the same thing.  To you, but wearing that medal reminds you of your son, helps you feel better about the day.  So if Chimney wants to ring some bells so he can feel better, what's wrong with that?  You never actually answered the question, though, Cap.  - Yeah. - (TRUCK HORN HONKS)   BOBBY: Ah, and help has arrived.  - Look at that. - (ELECTRICITY ZAPPING)   (QUIRKY SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)   ♪♪   And help is stopping to take pictures of us trapped in our own engine.

Maybe that curse is getting to you too.  Or maybe I just couldn't sleep.  Yeah, welcome to the club.  Am I interrupting book club?  Medical, babies, women.  Wondering why Buck had a book in his hand,     - but now it all makes sense. - (CHUCKLES)  Eddie, what would you say Ana's love language is?  Ana who?  Traitor.  Wait, are you dating someone?  Baby's not here yet. Who's Ana?  (SIGHS)  She was Christopher's old teacher last year.  Bumped into at the billboard call this morning, and...  hadn't seen her in a while, and I guess she's got a new job.  Wait, is this the teacher that you yelled at?  And I apologized for that.  But still didn't ask her out?  She's Christopher's teacher.  Thought you said she had a new job.   (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC)     (FIRE BELL RINGING)    - Oh. - DISPATCH: Station    .

  It happens. Sometimes they're criminals.  They use it as a ruse to get inside people's homes.  I don't think that's what this one is.  He seemed to want to help.  I mean, it's bad, but it's not...  It's worse. They're not trained.  They can wind up doing more harm than help.  Said all he ever wanted to be was a firefighter.  Yeah. Sometimes there are those guys.  Try out for every class, never make it, never give up.  You gotta admire the perseverance.  I do, and their dedication. But I also feel sorry for them.  Mm.
