 ANNOUNCER: Everyday heroes doing extraordinary things. 
 9-1-1 returns. 
 We're gonna find you. 
 ANNOUNCER: Catch all-new episodes Mondays and check out our other Fox programs. 
 Prodigal Son, Almost Family and The Resident. 
 There's more to the story than you know. 
 Only on Fox. 
 (carnival music) 
 * 
 (people screaming) 
 Whoa! 
 (both yell) 
 * 
 -Mmm. -Good? 
 Uh-huh. 
 * 
 I'm so proud of you right now, I could not be more proud of you! 
 Come on, we're so close! So close! 
 -(bell rings) -(both yell) 
 You did it! Come on, high five! 
 -Ohh! -(sirens wail) 
 And we have a winner! 
 (dramatic music) 
 * 
 BOY: Buck! 
 * 
 WOMAN: He was passing out those fliers and he just collapsed. 
 Let's get his pulse. 
 -BOY: Buck! -PARAMEDIC: I've got oxygen. 
 PARAMEDIC 2: Starting compressions. 
 * 
 Full compressions. 
 BOY: Buck! 
 Ventricular defibrillation. 
 -Shock needed. Clear! -Clear. 
 (electricity zaps) 
 * 
 There we go. Normal sinus rhythm. 
 -All right. -(both chuckle) 
 Ever think about what you wanna do with your life? 
 What you wanna be when you grow up? 
 Astronaut or a pirate. 
 Some good choices Cool outfits, too. 
 No, wait. A firefighter. 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Can you just hold steady for more than three seconds? 
 -How's the sketch? -Will you just hold it steady? 
 -Sheesh. -(whistle blows) 
 -(drops pencil) -MAN: Hey, Reggie! 
 Fun police, 2:00. 
 Morning, Commodore. 
 No flying drones on the pier. We've talked about this. 
 Actually, what you said was no unauthorized drone flying on the pier. 
 But you're the Harbormaster. You could authorize it. 
 Or I can call a cop. 
 But we're making art! 
 Would you have called a cop on Michelangelo for scribbling on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel? 
 If he were in violation of seventeen FAA regulations, yes. 
 Better do as he says, Charlie. 
 Your last warning. 
 Better not catch you doing it again. 
 Sorry, Reggie. Did you at least get it sketched? 
 -Enough to get me started. -Okay. 
 Well, I need to get home anyway before my dad finds out I swiped his drone. 
 (both laugh) 
 -Thursday? -I'll be here. 
 (imitates explosion) 
 Too close. 
 Charmed Life, Charmed Life, this is the Harbormaster. 
 Come in. 
 Charmed Life, be advised, you are too close to the pier. 
 It'll be an adventure. 
 It'll be a disaster. 
 Mom, have you taken a look at this boat? 
 It looks like you'll barely make it to Catalina, much less around the world. 
 Part of the adventure. 
 Oh, I've waited for this my whole life. 
 Out on the open ocean, just going wherever the waves take us. 
 (laughs) Wherever the waves take you. 
 See, that's not a plan, Chuck. 
 It's called life perspective, kid. 
 It's something you're too young to have yet. 
 Where does my mother fit into this...life perspective? 
 Ah, she's right at the heart of it. (laughs) 
 Are you ready, my love? Padre is waiting. 
 Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these beautiful souls. 
 * 
 (dramatic music)

 CHRISTOPHER: Where did all the water go? 
 * 
 (siren wails) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Into the cabin, now! 
 (yelling) 
 Go! Go! 
 (people screaming) 
 Run! 
 (shouting) Run, run! Go! 
 Get off the pier! 
 Everyone, high ground! Incoming flood, let's go! 
 -Move, move, move! -Let's go! 
 * 
 (screaming) 
 Get off the pier! 
 Here. 
 * 
 (sirens wailing) 
 CHRISTOPHER: Where did all the water come from? 
 (gasps, panting) 
 Christopher! 
 Christopher! Christopher! 
 -Christopher! Christopher! -Buck! Buck! 
 -Buck! -Chris! Chris! 
 Chris, just--just stay there! I'm coming. 
 (intense music) 
 * 
 Ah. 
 * 
 Just hang on. 
 Grab my hand! Christopher, reach out. 
 Grab my hand! No, Chris! 
 Chris! Chris! 
 Christopher! Stay over there! 
 -I can't hold on! -Just hold on, Christopher! 
 Buck! Buck! 
 * 
 (panting) 
 Right, I got you! 
 I--I got you, I got you. 
 * 
 (grunts) 
 (grunts) 
 * 
 (panting) 
 * 
 (water flowing) 
 (light music) 
 * 
 I'm not gonna lie, Tammy. I live for this. 
 Me and my baby girl getting treated like the queens we are. (chuckles) 
 I don't lie, either. 
 I like having two standing appointments every month. 
 (both laugh) 
 But I am gonna miss this young lady when she goes off to college. 
 Assuming I get accepted somewhere. 
 Not this again. 
 I haven't finished any applications. 
 I still need two letters of rec, and the U.C. app is a totally different thing. 
 And I haven't finished my essay. 
 Don't worry, baby. We'll--we'll figure this out. 
 (sighs) 
 All these websites say you're supposed to write about something important. 
 Well, what if I haven't done anything important? 
 Well, you're 17. No one's expecting you to write about that time you cured cancer. 
 (laughs) 
 Baby, why are you stressin' about this? 
 I shouldn't have come today. 
 You shouldn't have made me. 
 I should be studying for the ACT. 
 Well, I thought you could use a break. 
 -Oh, my God. -Baby, you got this. 
 -I know you do. -No, Mom. I don't. 
 -(tires screech) -(both gasp) 
 (crashing) 
 Any word on how Operation Buck Up Buck is going? 
 This was this morning. 
 "Full stack. Then I think the movies." 
 -Good luck. -By now, Chris has come down from a serious sugar high, and Buck is regretting his life choices. 
 Hey, did someone leave a hydrant open? 
 I don't think it's a hydrant, Cap. 
 (dramatic music) 
 (alarm blaring) 
 Baby, are you okay? 
 I'm okay. 
 -(trying door) -(grunts) 
 -It won't open. -(both grunting) 
 -Where'd you get that? -Your stepfather. 
 All right, shield your eyes. 
 (grunts) 
 -(alarms blaring) -(horns honking) 
 (chatter) 
 * 
 ATHENA: Okay. I am-- 
 LAPD. Everyone okay? 
 Someone ran the light. 
 MAN: Whoa, look out! Hey, back up, get away from that. 
 Everyone, move to the side. 
 Move to the side! We have a downed transformer. 
 Steer clear of it. 
 WOMAN: Something's wrong. 
 I'm on with 911, but they've got me on hold. 
 It's a tsunami. 
 Took out the pier. 
 * 
 No, keep going. Keep climbing. That-- 
 We'll send a unit as soon as we can get into the area, and it may take a while. 
 Jonas, how we doing? 
 JONAS: Ah, I think I may have gotten myself into a situation here. -No luck with the window? 
 JONAS: Went a different direction. 
 -Up. -You're in the attic. 
 Yeah. Wow, there's a lot of crap up here. 
 I thought maybe I could bust open a skylight, but it turns out, from inside the attic, it's just a wall. 
 Okay, well, let's work with what we've got. 
 Do you see anything you can use to break through the roof? 
 Uh-- 
 Not so much. 
 Oh, wait a minute! 
 I forgot I had a pack up here. 
 -A pack? -JONAS: Yeah, climbing gear. 
 My ex always said I was a gear-hoarder, She was right. 
 (laughs) 
 Thank God she was. Found an axe. 
 -(sighs) -JONAS: Looks like I'm chopping through a roof. 
 (laughs) I kinda wish I had a bigger axe. 
 Or, better idea: look for a roof vent. 
 Attics need ventilation and the structure will be weaker there. 
 How'd you know that? 
 (sighs) Believe it or not, we have protocols for this. 
 Talking someone through how to break through the roof. 
 Didn't know I'd be needing it today, but glad I have it. 
 (grunts) Me too! 
 Ohh, all right. (laughs) 
 -Found a vent! -Okay, focus on the edges where the vent is attached to the sheathing. 
 Don't try to muscle your way through the middle of it. 
 -(beeping) -Swift Water Command, this is dispatch. 
 Checking on request for Code Three at 801 North Tenth Street. 
 SWIFT WATER COMMANDER: Delayed. 
 Boats haven't been able to get that far west yet. 
 Too many Code Threes in the water. 
 Jonas, talk to me. Any progress? 
 (grunting) 
 (grunts) 
 JONAS: It broke. 
 I'm not getting out of here. 
 MADDIE: No, no, no. 
 We are gonna keep fighting Me and you. 
 JONAS: I've summited six of the world's highest peaks. 
 I can't make it to the roof of my own house. 
 I'm gonna die in this stupid attic. 
 Come on, you must have had some pretty crazy adventures. 
 You survived them. 
 JONAS: I almost didn't once. (panting) 
 K2 is a savage beast. 
 Horrible, unpredictable weather. 
 We were near the summit when the avalanche hit. 
 I got separated from the others. 
 I thought I was gonna die alone. 
 MADDIE: Well, you're not alone. 
 I'm here, Jonas. I'm with you. 
 JONAS: It was so cold, but bright. 
 The way the sun was bouncing off the snow, it didn't make any sense. 
 Dying, surrounded by all that sunshine. 
 But you didn't die that day. 
 JONAS: They found my line. 
 They pulled me out. 
 You ever make it to the summit? 
 JONAS: Oh, yeah. 
 It was like... looking down on the sky 
 (somber music) 
 It was so beautiful. 
 Ah-- 
 Jonas? 
 (beeping) 
 * 
 Jonas. 
 (beeping) 
 (exhales) 
 911. 
 (clears throat) What's your emergency? 
 * 
 (sirens wailing) 
 (chatter) 
 One wave did all of this? 
 * 
 HARLAN: We already had two so far. 
 Expect another four or five before it starts to recede. 
 We're commandeering everything that'll float to supplement our Zodiacs. 
 I heard there were four firehouses 
 -in the path of this thing. -Yeah, they've all checked in. 
 Except for the 136. 
 They were responding to a call at the pier when the surge hit, so-- if you see any blue out there... 
 We'll holler. 
 * 
 (panting) You good, Chris? 
 -Yep. I took surfing lessons. -(laughs) 
 Oh, well, maybe you can teach me. 
 (chuckles, sighs) 
 All right, I'm gonna take a look around and see what I see. 
 I guess we're gonna have to hang out here a little longer. 
 We have a firetruck. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 WOMAN: Help! 
 Help me! 
 * 
 Help! 
 BUCK: I'll help! Yeah! 
 I--I'm gonna come for you! 
 -Help! -BUCK: Okay, okay. 
 Chris, um, I-- 
 I need you to sit right here for me. 
 -You promise me? -Yeah. 
 -Okay, right here. Right here. -Yeah. Yeah. 
 WOMAN: Help! Help! 
 * 
 Help! Help me! 
 * 
 Help! 
 Here I am! 
 Hurry up! 
 (grunts) 
 -Hurry up! -MAN: Help, I can't get out. 
 I can't get out. 
 I--I'll help you. I will come back. 
 Okay, I promise you. 
 Help! 
 * 
 (panting) 
 (grunts) 
 Help! 
 Help! 
 Hey! Hey, you can let go! 
 Okay? I need you to let go. 
 You can do it! 
 * 
 Okay, you're doing great. 
 * 
 You're doing great! 
 * 
 Gimme that hand. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 You're doing so great. You're doing so great. 
 * 
 Just climb up. You're okay. You got it. 
 * 
 -Buck. People. -(panting) 
 MAN: Please! 
 -all: Help! Help! -WOMAN: Somebody-- 
 -Will you watch him? -Okay. 
 -Yeah? -MAN: Help! 
 MAN: Help! 
 WOMAN: Help us, please! 
 WOMAN: Help us! Please help! 
 (chatter) 
 LINDA: No. The line's still open. 
 Protocol says we do not hang up. 
 Not until help arrives or they're safe. 
 SUE: You said he was in a flooding car. 
 (Linda sighs) 
 SUE: It's been over 20 minutes since he said anything, Linda. 
 The line's still open. 
 I--I can't-- 
 -(hangs up) -(dial tone buzzes) 
 It's okay. Go take a break. 
 * 
 I never thought I'd see you disconnect a call. 
 (sighs) Water-resistant phones. 
 They can keep working for 30 minutes after being submerged. 
 Ain't technology great? 
 How are you holding up? 
 I have both feet on dry land. I'll be okay. 
 Good. This day's not over. 
 -Okay, what can I do. -You used to run an emergency room, right? 
 Well, that's what this is. 
 I need you on the floor with me doing triage. 
 Okay, but we have a system in place to prioritize the calls. 
 Well, not the calls, I need you to triage them. 
 Make sure they're doing okay. 
 Identify where we can help and be brutal about where we can't. 
 Be the bad guy if you have to. 
 Like you just did with Linda. 
 Today's gonna take a toll... on all of us. 
 * 
 (alarm blaring) 
 Okay, let's work fast, people, in between waves. 
 * 
 (beeping) 
 WOMAN: Help! 
 Please! 
 Help! 
 -Cap! -I see it, Chim. 
 * 
 WOMAN: Help! 
 -Get into my arms. -Don't move, sir. 
 We'll be right there. 
 Be careful, guys. Unstable. 
 WOMAN: And my sons are inside. Please hurry! 
 I'll check you out, sir. 
 * 
 -I'm suck. -Gentlemen, can you hear me? 
 MAN: Yes! 
 -(man groans) -All right. 
 Antenna from the radio station pierced the hull. 
 -Then it pierced them. -(pained groans) 
 They're skewered together from the shoulder... through the abdomen... to the bottom of the boat. 
 And this boat is taking on water. 
 We need a plan, Cap, and we need it fast. 
 (pained grunts) 
 HEN: Normally, we'd travel them both with object intact, and let the ER sort it out. 
 Except for this case, the object is a radio station antenna and a boat. 
 We need to separate them. Can we do that? 
 It seems to have missed the kid's heart and lungs. 
 I'm not sure about the stepdad. 
 He's got about a half dozen vital organs it could've hit, So as long as we keep both pieces in them, maybe. 
 That's not a no. 
 -Adele, please. -No, I'm not leaving you-- 
 -either of you. -Whatever happened to love, honor and obey? 
 I never said "obey." 
 We didn't even finish the ceremony. 
 It's okay, Mom. Please, just go. 
 He's right, ma'am. Best thing to do now is just let us work. 
 I love you both so much. 
 HEN: I got you, I got you. 
 Let's get you to the boat. 
 Okay, we have a plan. 
 Only one plan... you save this kid. 
 What? No, Chuck, you're already insufferable. 
 Don't be insufferable and magnanimous. 
 I can't take it. 
 CHUCK: She is the love of my life. 
 He is the love of hers. 
 Save...save him. 
 Our job is to save you both, so that's what we're gonna do. 
 -Cover 'em up, Eddie. -Got you. 
 * 
 All right. 
 Eddie, Hen, I need you to lift him up. 
 And Jason, if you can get on your knees at all, I need you to try, okay? 
 HEN: Careful, it's gonna hurt. 
 Turn your head away. 
 (saw grinding) 
 -JASON: Oh! -(pained grunts) 
 -Okay. -Let's get him up. 
 (groans) 
 Jason. Oh, shh, it's all right. 
 What about Chuck? 
 Abdomen's distended and warm. 
 I'm pretty sure his spleen's ruptured. 
 He'll probably lose too much blood if we pull him off this. 
 We'll have to cut from underneath. 
 Underneath what? 
 Always did love Jacques Cousteau as a kid. 
 You and me, both. 
 * 
 Cap's in the water. 
 * 
 BOBBY: Chimney, you seeing this? 
 * 
 CHIMNEY: We got another surge! 
 * 
 This is a problem. 
 Hey, you said you were a cop. Why can't you take a report? 
 Sir, do I look like I'm on duty? 
 Well, can you get someone down here who is? 
 Her insurance needs to pay for this. 
 -What are you talking about? -You rear-ended me! 
 -It's a pile-up! -People, people! 
 There's some real trouble down by the beach. 
 Y'all waiting for help to come? It's already here. 
 And it's us. 
 Check in with your neighbor. See if anyone needs help. 
 We're all we've got right now. 
 * 
 (horn honking) 
 -(honking) -Hey. 
 -Oh, thank God. -What's your name? 
 -Vicky. -All right, Vicky, -can you move? -Yeah. 
 Just not out of here. 
 My leg is pinned, and I don't know how much longer I can keep the pressure on this. 
 -Okay, okay. 
 The blood's not pumping out of the wound. 
 I think that's a good thing. 
 Just hold it there another second. 
 * 
 May! 
 Come on, I need your help! 
 * 
 Come here. 
 I need you to put pressure on this while I go get the first aid kit. 
 -Mom, I--I-- -Just for a minute. 
 Okay. 
 May. May! Look at me. 
 Now is not the time for you to be frightened. 
 So put your hand here and hold it. 
 Come on. 
 * 
 Not too much pressure. Okay. 
 I'll be right back. 
 * 
 (grunts) 
 * 
 
 
 
 VICKY: Your name's May? 
 -I'm Vicky. -Hi. 
 Did I hear someone say there was a tsunami, or... am I dreaming? 
 -There was. -Wow. 
 MAN: Sewer's backing up. 
 ATHENA: It's just spillover. 
 (electricity crackles) 
 MAN: I want that report! 
 -Officer! -Sir! 
 Officer! 
 (electricity zapping) 
 * 
 -...unusual, right? -Oh, God! 
 Oh, my God. Mom! 
 -Mom! -(electricity crackles) 
 May! May! No, stop! 
 Go back into that van until I tell you to come out. 
 Do you hear me? 
 Oh, God. 
 Vicky, come on. 
 -Okay. -I'm really sorry about this. 
 You're fine. You're gonna be fine. 
 * 
 EDDIE: Water's coming faster, Cap! 
 Copy that, Eddie. 
 I'll bang three times on the hull when it's done. 
 Chuck? Can you hear me? 
 He's not breathing. 
 How's his pulse? 
 We gotta do CPR underwater. 
 -CPR underwater? -We can't do compressions unless he's flat. -How's he gonna get air? 
 He's not breathing anyway. 
 It's just to keep him from drowning. 
 At least for a minute. 
 There's a scuba mask over there. 
 Grab it, put it on him. 
 * 
 Three, two, one. 
 * 
 You got him? 
 * 
 Nothing. 
 * 
 Nothing. 
 * 
 Nothing. 
 * 
 -(clanging) -Eddie, antenna is clear. 
 * 
 I got a pulse! 
 Free the mask. 
 -(coughs) -(sighs) 
 There we go. Welcome back, Chuck. 
 (laughs) 
 Oh, hell of a save, Hen. Hell of a save. 
 I can't believe it worked. 
 Bring in that backboard! 
 -(laughter) -Can't believe it worked. 
 -Ready? One, two three. -MAN: If you read, 118, we need backup at the Santa Monica Pier. 
 Good job down there, guys. 
 -BOTH: Thanks. -CHIMNEY: Copy that. Cap! 
 The man is asking for available hands down at the Pier. 
 Okay, Chim, Hen, you transport the patients. 
 -Copy that. -Eddie, you're with me. 
 -BOTH: Copy that. -We'll regroup at the staging area. 
 * 
 I got 911, finally. 
 This is Athena Grant, LAPD. 
 I'm at the intersection of Brockton and Wilshire There's a multi-car pile-up with serious injuries. 
 We got water in the street and a downed transformer. 
 I need a DWP crew right now! 
 DISPATCHER: All DWP crews are engaged. 
 The power's not out in your area, Sergeant. 
 I know the power is not out. That's the damn problem. 
 I got folks out here dying in the street. 
 DISPATCHER: Nearest DWP crew is at Rose and Granville. 
 They can be there within the hour. 
 That's not gonna work. 
 We got a woman bleeding out here. 
 * 
 No, no, no. Don't lie down. No, no, don't lie down. 
 Come on. 
 Stay on hold. 
 Who are you calling? 
 -Jacobs. JACOBS: Yeah? 
 This is Athena. 
 I need you to find me a black and white. 
 The closest thing you got to Rose and Granville. 
 May. It's okay. 
 * 
 No, no! But-- No, you have to sit up. 
 There was less blood when you were sitting up. 
 -Come on. -It's okay. 
 Stop saying that! 
 It's not okay. It's not. 
 Help is coming. My mom's out there. 
 She'll figure something out. 
 Just keep your head up. Come on. 
 -Keep my head up. -Keep your head up. 
 -Yeah. -Come on, Vicky, you can. 
 Okay, you're gonna stay awake, and you're gonna stay alive. 
 -I need to rest. -I don't give a damn. 
 I'm sure there are people who love you, who expect you to make it home to them. 
 Okay, no offense, but I never wanna have to meet them and tell them how you died in my arms. 
 I'm 17 years old. 
 You're not gonna traumatize me like that, got it? 
 Nobody in this car's dying. Not today. 
 You're one tough cookie, you know that? 
 (siren wails) 
 You got someone trapped in a car? 
 Yeah, two. I got two someones. 
 We're clear. 
 (sirens wailing) 
 (horn blares) 
 May, I'm here. 
 * 
 I tried to keep her awake. 
 I really tried, Mom. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 (somber music) 
 * 
 PARAMEDIC: Stretcher coming through. 
 * 
 FEMALE PARAMEDIC: We've got a pulse. 
 MALE PARAMEDIC: Okay, let's go, let's go. 
 She's alive. 
 Yes, baby. She was alive because you kept her alive. 
 -(sobs) -Hey, hey. Hey! Who-- 
 I was so scared. 
 Of course you were. 
 But you did good. Just like I knew you would. 
 I'm not you, Mom. 
 Well, I wasn't always me, either. 
 It took me a minute to get here. 
 You'll get there. 
 (both crying) 
 * 
 Hey, you doing okay? 
 Yep, still people out there who need our help, -so that's what I'm gonna do. -I think Ann needs a break. 
 Code Three. Tension pneumo. 
 I sent the ambulance to St. Mary's in Culver, but they're telling me they're tapped out. 
 Okay, and the three closest hospitals are flooded. 
 -What about UCLA? -They just asked me 
 -to reroute three calls. -Playa Vista's gonna be 
 -your best bet. -(phone buzzing) 
 Hi, Chimney. You guys okay? 
 Yeah, we're all fine, but I'm hoping you can help me cut through some red tape. 
 We keep pulling Level Ones out of the water and we have no place to send 'em. 
 We're sending victims to every dry hospital we can find. 
 We have a system in place. 
 CHIMNEY: Well, whoever's in charge of that system is doing a terrible job. 
 That would be me. 
 A terribly good job under extremely difficult circumstances. 
 So, what, the hospitals recall all their staff? 
 It's not about staff. They are flooded with staff. 
 It's about beds and space. 
 (sighs) What we need is a field hospital. 
 A triage, closer to the water. 
 Stabilize and move 'em inland as beds open up. 
 Wait. The VA hospital on Sawtelle, it's not far from where you are now and it's out of the flood zone. 
 Why aren't we sending patients there now? 
 Because it was decommissioned two months ago. 
 CHIMNEY: It'll be totally empty. 
 -Right. -Right. 
 See, I told you you were doing a great job. 
 Uh-huh. I'll talk to Sue and see if we can make this happen. 
 Okay, sounds good. Oh... one other thing, how are you? 
 Honestly? 
 (sighs) Happy to hear your voice. 
 And weirdly grateful that my brother has a serious blood clot condition and is nowhere near this nightmare. 
 -(laughs) -MADDIE: Is that wrong? 
 Not at all. 
 Okay, I spy, with my little eye, something that... moves people around. 
 Um-- 
 Oh. A scooter. 
 Ah, yeah. Nice one. (chuckles) 
 Okay, genius. Your turn. 
 I spy a shopping cart. 
 What? No, come on. 
 Hey, that's not how the game works. 
 You can't just yell stuff out. 
 But yelling stuff out is the fun part! 
 You amaze me, buddy. 
 -Why? -I got some bad news at work the other day, and I didn't wanna get out of bed for a whole week. 
 But you, after the day you had, here you are, with a big smile, bustin' a gut. 
 (chuckles) 
 You never gave up. 
 Even when that water was rushing over you back there. 
 You just kept on swimming. 
 -Like Dory. -(chuckles) 
 Yeah, like Dory. 
 And not just today. You know, but every day. 
 You never say no, you never complain. 
 How--how do you do that? 
 Well, I complained once, but it didn't work. 
 So what did you do?

 Maddie, I just got off the phone with the Deputy Mayor and State Emergency Services. 
 Everybody's on board with the VA field hospital. 
 When will it be operational? 
 Well--thank you. Let's see, generators and cots are being sent over now. 
 And they said that we can start routing patients in an hour. 
 That's great. 
 Oh, can you call ME-Coroner and Red Cross? 
 Tell them bodybags need to be sent to the VA.
