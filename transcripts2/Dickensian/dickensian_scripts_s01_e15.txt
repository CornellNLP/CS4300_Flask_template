 ( Magpies chatter ) 
 ( Hooves clop ) 
 ( Horse neighs ) 
 Heavens! 
 Where? 
 Oh, my goodness! 
 This way. 
 Heavens! 
 Oh, a body! 
 Oh! 
 What? 
 ( She gasps ) 
 He's dead? 
 Stand back from the body, please! 
 Oh, Inspector! 
 Is this the same killer as what finished off Mr Marley? 
 I'm not at liberty to give out any information at the moment. 
 ( Concerned murmurs ) 
 Pour soul... 
 ( Laughter and chatter ) 
 ( She sighs ) 
 ( Door opens ) 
 ( Street bustle ) 
 TAP! 
 TAP! 
 ( Giggling ) 
 ( She chuckles ) 
 You can't stay too long. Frances will be back soon. 
 I think she's fond of me, secretly. 
 VERY secretly. 
 Well, I think she'll like you even more if you get your promotion this morning. 
 Oh, it's mine for the taking, don't worry about that. 
 You seem very confident. 
 I am. 
 In fact, from now on, I expect to be dressed as Major Hawdon at all times. 
 Should I curtsy, as well? 
 Of course. 
 Mm... 
 I think I prefer my modest captain. 
 Well, how can I be modest when the most beautiful girl in the world is in love with me? 
 ( She chuckles ) 
 Jaggers : A banker's draft. 
 £10,000. 
 Your share of the brewery. 
 That's a very generous amount, Mr Havisham. 
 You owe your sister a great debt of gratitude. 
 I wasn't aware the money came with any debt attached. 
 Of course it doesn't! 
 This is what you deserve, Arthur. We want you to have it. 
 So you can finally be rid of me? 
 No! The very opposite. 
 Meriwether and I thought that it would help build bridges between us... 
 Arthur! 
 Arthur! 
 ( Door opens ) 
 Arthur! What's the matter? 
 Aren't you pleased? 
 Now you can pay off your debts or start your own business. 
 Do anything you want. 
 It's up to you, of course, but if you would consider coming to live with us, it would make me happier than you can imagine. 
 Live with you... and HIM? 
 Why not? I thought you were friends. 
 Well, I understand it must be hard for you to accept another man at Satis House... 
 That's NOT what I'm concerned about. 
 Then what is it? 
 Tell me! 
 Meriwether Compeyson. 
 I want you to find anything and everything you can about him. 
 Yes, Mr Jaggers. 
 ( Market bustle ) 
 Miss Barbary! 
 Is Honoria back yet? 
 No. Sadly, our dear aunt is terribly sick. 
 I would so like to speak with her. Do you know how long she'll be? 
 What exactly is it that you're asking me, Miss Havisham? 
 To estimate the date of our poor aunt's demise? 
 No, of course not! 
 Well, then, I shall bid you good day. 
 Bruising to the eye... and cheek. 
 ( Instruments jingle ) 
 Knife wound... to the ribs. 
 It's a different weapon. 
 Different style of attack. 
 Different killer. 
 Ah, the great detective at work(!) 
 Unfeasible, is it, that a man may be unfaithful to his weapon of choice? 
 Inspector Thompson. 
 Bucket. You're the talk of the town, man. 
 Now I can see exactly why. 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning the people have grown weary, Detective. 
 Lost faith, shall we say. 
 Weeks gone by, and no progress. 
 Same man locked up, day after day, no charge, and now, of course, another body. 
 This killing bears no resemblance whatsoever to the murder of Jacob Marley. 
 Now, if you'd kindly leave us... 
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you're off the case. 
 I'm taking over. Commissioner's orders. 
 Time for a different method... 
 Detective. 
 Your favourite, from Garraway's. 
 I'll make a pot of tea to have with it. 
 Frances! 
 Thank you... for everything. 
 What else would a sister do? 
 Oh! 
 I'm fine, Ma. 
 He needs practice. 
 Don't go too far, now. 
 I'm only walking Peter to the Forge. 
 Just be careful! 
 Hey, wait for me, then! 
 ( Bustle, metal hammering nearby ) 
 ( Children laugh ) 
 Nothing better you can be doing with your time than following me? 
 This has gone too far. You cannot marry my sister, I won't allow it. 
 Really? 
 Whatever will you do about it? 
 Tell your wife. 
 It's only a matter of time before she discovers the truth. 
 Havisham, you know nothing about my marriage. 
 Come to think of it, you know nothing about marriage at all. 
 So, please, don't bore me with your empty threats. 
 Our arrangement is over. 
 In fact, I would count myself very lucky if I were you. 
 What if Amelia were to find out the truth? 
 Then she would find out the truth about you. 
 We both know you're not that foolish, Havisham. 
 ( Thudding, grunting ) 
 ( Punches land, man groans ) 
 ( Coughing ) 
 ( Groaning, police grunt ) 
 Come on! 
 Come on, you! 
 ( Man struggles and grunts ) 
 ( Grunting ) 
 ( Thumping, he groans ) 
 One full confession for the murder of Jacob Marley and our unfortunate friend downstairs. 
 How about that, Detective? 
 Does that still stand even when the man's been beaten to within an inch of his life? 
 I've achieved more this morning than you have in weeks. 
 If I were you, I'd keep your snide remarks to yourself. 
 ( Knock at door ) 
 We agreed you'd stay away! 
 Honoria's sleeping. 
 I'm not here to see Honoria. 
 It's you I want to talk to. 
 Now what? 
 Don't play games, Frances. 
 Admit the truth. 
 You are a bitter, manipulative shrew. 
 Get out! Get out! 
 Well, I'm sure Honoria will be thrilled to discover what a brute she's tethered herself to! 
 And what of the discovery that her sister is a barefaced liar? 
 James! 
 How dare you speak to Frances like that? 
 What's going on? 
 After my interview, I met with a colleague, Sergeant George. 
 He came to this house weeks ago and left a message with your sister. 
 It was an invitation to meet with Colonel Mortimer, who was intending to offer me a promotion. 
 But the message was never passed on. 
 I have no recollection of meeting a Sergeant George. 
 Liar! 
 You deliberately sabotaged my promotion. 
 ( Door clanks ) 
 Time to go. 
 Why so soon? 
 Oy... 
 Another man's been charged. 
 ( Fagin groans ) 
 You were wrong, Inspector(?) 
 I did what I thought was right. 
 You did it to stop me and Honoria being together. 
 I had your best interests at heart. 
 It's unlikely that such a bitter woman courts anyone's best interests but her own! 
 Are you content to stand by and allow this abuse? 
 If we could just calm ourselves? 
 I'll go, Honoria. 
 I don't want to upset you any more. 
 Now, why don't you come with me? 
 She can't go out in broad daylight for everyone to see! 
 She'll do anything to keep us apart. Can you not see that? 
 James, stop. 
 Come with me, please? 
 Be patient. 
 It's just a few more weeks. 
 And, hopefully, I'll never have to lay eyes on you again. 
 How could you? 
 That was weeks ago. 
 Before any of this. 
 The baby! 
 It won't kill you to say it. 
 You're my little sister. 
 All I want to do is protect you. 
 ( Loud knocking ) 
 ( Knocking ) 
 All right! All right! I'm not deaf! 
 Mr Gradgrind! 
 Er, Mrs Bumble. 
 You quite took me by surprise. 
 A very pleasant one, I might add. 
 May I come in? 
 Two lumps for you, Mr Gradgrind? 
 Excuse me? 
 Sugar. 
 Do you partake? 
 Er, no, thank you. 
 Have you any idea when your husband might be returning? 
 Oh, I'm sure he won't be too much longer. 
 May I... tempt you to... some of my figgy dowdy? 
 Extra moist. 
 
 
 
 ( Pub chatter ) 
 Mr Bumble! 
 Just seen your good lady wife. 
 Seemed all in a bit of a flurry. Looking for you, she was. 
 Oh! 
 Er... 
 ( He grumbles ) 
 Oh! Medicinal - after that godforsaken scene this morning. 
 Bill, have you heard? 
 Heard what? 
 Fagin, he's out. 
 They arrested someone else. 
 ( Silence ) 
 ( Concerned murmurs ) 
 ( They chatter ) 
 ( Door opens ) 
 I wasn't expecting to see you today. 
 A man can't surprise his fiancee? 
 I missed you. 
 What is it? 
 Something wrong? 
 Please, sit down. 
 Flowers... for my flower. 
 ( He chuckles uncertainly ) 
 Is there something the matter, my dear? 
 You are the matter, Bumble. As always. 
 We received a visitor earlier, Mr Gradgrind. 
 Oh... 
 Your interview was a disaster. 
 Oh... 
 Never before has the Board seen such a show of incompetence. 
 Bumble by name, Bumble by nature. 
 Imagine my shame. 
 This afternoon has seen me plummet to the depths of degradation. 
 A woman of my standing... begging, pleading... beseeching! 
 But, once again, I have managed to salvage the situation. 
 You have? 
 My efforts have persuaded Mr Gradgrind to put you through to the next stage of the application process. 
 ( He chuckles ) 
 Your neck is on the line, Bumble. 
 Mess it up this time, and I won't save it... 
 I shall BREAK it. 
 ( He gulps ) 
 You're prepared to allow your brother's bitterness to threaten our happiness? 
 He's worried about me, that's all. 
 He's worried about getting his greedy hands on the estate, not about your welfare. 
 For all I care, he could have the entire damn Havisham fortune! 
 Meriwether! 
 What can I do to prove myself? 
 All I want is to be your husband. 
 Yes, but why rush into it? 
 I know that's what people are thinking. 
 Amelia... 
 If you have doubts yourself... 
 No! 
 Then, to hell with everyone else. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I've been a fool. 
 Well, yes, you have. 
 A huge fool. 
 Could you forgive me? 
 I'm going to buy you a present. 
 Something to wear on the day. What do you need? 
 The only thing I will ever need is you. 
 Sometimes, it just takes a fresh pair of eyes. 
 Don't be too hard on yourself. 
 We're going for a little celebration, would you care to join us? I think we've earned it. 
 No, thank you very much. 
 You let the old Jew go, then? 
 The case is closed. 
 I couldn't let him fester without charge. 
 I'm not talking about keeping him locked up. 
 Hang the wretch. It's not too late. 
 Much as I detest the man, I won't let him hang without evidence of his crimes. 
 ( He chuckles ) 
 You're very noble, Detective. 
 But, right now, some poor soul is being robbed blind by him. 
 Are you sure you can't be tempted? 
 ( Door creaks ) 
 ( Growling ) 
 ( Dog pants and snaps ) 
 Good boy, Bull's Eye. 
 ( Bull's eye pants and growls ) 
 Good boy. 
 ( Horses whinny ) 
 ( Livery jangles ) 
 Hello, Peter. 
 Why won't you greet Miss Sweetheart? 
 She ain't my sweetheart no more. 
 Why not? 
 Because a nice girl like Nell needs a gentleman... to take her places and buy her things. That's what she deserves and that's what I can't afford. 
 He's a bit wild, Fagin, but don't worry, I'll keep him on a tight leash so he don't sink his teeth in yer. 
 ( Jingling ) 
 ( Coins jangle ) 
 Rest of the chinks... for Nancy. 
 ( Ship's horns in distance ) 
 Count it. 
 I'm in no rush. 
 I trust you implicitly, Bill. 
 Hm. 
 Here she is. 
 The daughter I never had. 
 You're leaving me, my dear? 
 Bill... 
 Give us a minute. 
 Come on, Bull's Eye, come on. 
 ( Growling ) 
 Well, what can I say? First Dodger, and now you. 
 Oh, that ain't fair. 
 You made your bed with Dodger, you can lie in it. 
 Sorry, my dear. 
 I don't fare very well with goodbyes. 
 I'm hardly abandoning you, for Pete's sake. 
 I'll only be down the road. 
 Not the same. 
 Yeah, well... 
 It'd be an odd life if nothing changed, wouldn't it? 
 This is what I want. 
 Settle down and have a family. 
 With him? 
 Yeah, with Bill. 
 ( He scoffs ) 
 I love him. 
 You deserve better. 
 I didn't come here for your blessing. 
 If it weren't for you... 
 I'd be long dead. 
 Good or bad... you're the nearest thing I've had to a parent, so... 
 VOICE BREAKING: I want to say thank you. 
 ( Footsteps approach ) 
 Take care of yourself, will you? 
 Be careful, my dear. 
 Inspector Thompson is a very aggravating man indeed. 
 I'm impressed with your restraint. 
 ( Plates clatter ) 
 Thank you very much, Mrs Cratchit. They look delicious, as always. 
 Inspector, is it true someone's been arrested for the murders? 
 I suppose it's pointless to ask who? 
 Oh, I'm afraid it is. 
 Penny for your thoughts, Mr Bucket? 
 You were right, Mr Venus. 
 Never let a personal grudge cloud your judgment, however IMMEASURABLE that grudge may be. 
 I've wasted precious time on the most obvious suspect. 
 A childish error. 
 I'll leave that sort of crude approach to Inspector Thompson. 
 So, what now, then? 
 A new investigation? 
 A detective does not give up so easily. 
 Forgive me, but, in light of the fact that you've been removed from the case, I can't see any choice but to leave it all to him. 
 If I stop now, the detective has failed. 
 I will not allow that to happen. 
 I will continue with my OWN investigation. 
 Confidentially, of course. 
 I'll have to tread with the utmost care and attention. 
 I'll also need to employ a different method, more... meticulous... 
 The Devil, as ever, is in the detail. 
 And I will catch this Devil, if it's the last thing I do. 
 ( Clattering ) 
 Frances? 
 What is the meaning of this? 
 How dare you read my private correspondence? 
 "My dear Sir Leicester, it cheers my heart to know that I will see you again soon. I have thought of you often. Yours, with great affection, Honoria"? 
 ( She sighs ) 
 ( Street bustle ) 
 ( Horse whinnies ) 
 Come on, I ain't expecting cartwheels, but you might crack a smile. 
 What about when he finds out it's his own money in that bag? 
 Well, the greedy old mumper...  ( She laughs )  ...can taste his own medicine for a change, can't he? 
 ( She laughs ) 
 Happy, ain't yer? 
 Course. 
 ( She laughs ) 
 Oh! No, Bill! 
 Bill! 
 ( She laughs ) 
 Stop it! 
 ( They laugh ) 
 Honoria! 
 ( She knocks ) 
 I'll break the door down if you don't answer! 
 Go away! 
 ( Hooves clop ) 
 ( Market bustle ) 
 ( Hoofbeats ) 
 Stop, driver! 
 ( Horses snort ) 
 ( Inaudible conversation ) 
 Honoria! No! 
 ( Honoria grunts ) 
 ( Crashing ) 
 ( Honoria pants ) 
 What were you thinking? 
 That you deserve better than Hawdon. 
 Oh, and what about the baby? 
 How were you planning to explain that to Sir Leicester? 
 I don't know! 
 There was no great plan. 
 I was trying to protect my family. 
 Well, now, I am protecting MINE. James and our baby. 
 What about me? 
 What about you?! 
 Now... I'm going to be with the man I love and there is nothing you can do to stop me any more... you jealous, bitter creature. 
 A b*st*rd child with a peasant soldier? 
 Oh, yes. I'm so very jealous(!) 
 You are poison! 
 ( She gasps ) 
 ( She moans ) 
 ( She pants ) 
 It's too soon... 
 Frances, it's too soon... 
 ( She pants )
