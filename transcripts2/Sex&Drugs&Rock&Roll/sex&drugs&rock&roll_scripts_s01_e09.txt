 Holy sh1t. No whiskey in your coffee? 
 Must be something serious. 
 Johnny : [groans] Why don't you blow me? 
 Why? 'Cause Ava isn't? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 She told Gigi that things have slowed down for you guys in the sack lately. 
 Look at me. I'm your age. 
 And I got a 21-year-old girlfriend, right? 
 Look at you. You look like sh1t. 
 She's not your girlfriend. 
 You're a revenge f*ck. That's what you are, okay? 
 She's just sleeping with you to get back at me. 
 Dude, your daughter's worried about you. 
 Your woman isn't interested in having s*x with you. 
 Ava loves me. That's a given, okay? 
 She doesn't want to blow you. 
 So that's in danger of turning into a brother-sister kind of love. 
 I have a sister. 
 I don't find her attractive. You know why? 
 'Cause she's my goddamn sister. 
 Get your sh1t together. 
 Take a good look in the mirror. 
 Actually, don't look in the mirror. 
 Why? 
 It ain't that pretty, pal. 
 Hey, hon, how old do you think I look? 
 [groans] I don't know. 
 How old do you want to look?

 Ira : Fantastic. I love it. 
 And it couldn't come at a better time, guys. 
 Ava : What do you mean? 
 Ira : I have some potentially big and earth-shattering news. 
 I got an offer from Sony Music. 
 Get this. They want to sign Gigi. 
 They think she's gonna be the next big thing, and the advance is $250,000. 
 Flash : What? 
 Ira : Hang on. Hang on, everybody. Everybody, just relax. 
 Relax. I'm not done yet. 
 As with all things too good to be true, And there is a significant catch. 
 Who cares? It's $250,000. 
 Signify, baby. Go ahead. 
 [sighs] 
 They don't want the whole band. 
 What do you mean? 
 They only want you. 
 Johnny : Okay, screw that. 
 We're not doing that. No way. 
 You tell them they take everybody or they don't take anyone, right, guys? 
 both : Right. 
 That's right. We're a team. 
 Flash : We create as a team. 
 And this particular team sticks together, right, guys? 
 Right. 
 Absolutely. 
 They also want to hire Johnny and Flash to be Gigi's songwriters. 
 I mean, you know, "team" could be the wrong word. 
 Yeah, we're not the goddamn NBA here. 
 We don't have uniforms. 
 What are you talking about? 
 This is family, guys. 
 That's what's most important. 
 They'll make a separate deal with Johnny and Flash, and you'll each get your own advance. 
 Although, you know, family really is about blood and cohabitation. 
 Yep, it really is. 
 What'd they say about me and Rehab? 
 They said the drummer was too fat. 
 Told you to go on a diet. 
 And the bass player looked old enough to be Frank Zappa's father. 
 Ha-ha. How's your face now? 
 Johnny : You know, you are looking pretty ancient, Rehab. 
 Ira : So do you, John. 
 And they also want you to get a full makeover, head to toe... New haircut, new threads, new image. 
 They start their PR machine, they don't want Gigi standing next to someone stuck in 1992. 
 Their words, not mine. I'm sorry. 
 Rehab : Guys, we're not actually gonna do this, right? 
 Ira : They're gonna bring in a famed pop producer named Amor to do the single. 
 And they want to shoot a video. 
 Now, I want to be clear here. 
 They want something commercial. 
 They're not gonna throw this kind of money around unless you're willing to s*x it up and sell out a little. 
 Bam : Sell out? 
 Guys, we're not gonna sell out. 
 A little... Just sell out a little. That's what he said, okay? 
 Let's all relax. 
 It's not our decision. 
 It's Gigi's decision, right? 
 It's Gigi's career. 
 Yes, it is. 
 It's Gigi's image, honey. 
 So you shouldn't be thinking about what Ira wants you to do or what I want you to do. 
 You should be thinking about what you want to do. 
 And I know you probably need some time to make that decision, so... 
 Yes. 
 This is why I came here. 
 This is what I've wanted since I was five years old. 
 This has been my dream. Amor is huge. 
 He secretly produced huge pop hits for J.Lo and for Ariana Grande and Rihanna. 
 I'm sorry, you guys. 
 I really, really am. 
 But this could be my big break. 
 Ira : Listen, I can get you guys some DJ gigs. 
 Steve the Monkey's got a ton of birthday parties coming up, and he's thinking of busting a few moves. 
 DJ gigs with monkeys. 
 Yeah, it falls under the beast-core umbrella and... so... 
 Screw you, Ira. 
 You don't get to fire us, man. 
 'Cause we quit. 
 Wait. Wait a minute, okay? 
 No, we do not need you assholes. 
 We do. We do need these... 
 No, beast-core does not have an umbrella, man. 
 Okay? And you don't know the first thing about it. 
 We invented it. 
 Time Out New York  called us cutting-edge. 
 And we are not about to sell out like some pop-schlock pissants who are ready to suck some corporate cock. 
 We are performance artists! 
 Yeah. 
 We have integrity! 
 Yeah. 
 We have a beast-core manifesto! 
 We do? 
 Yeah, man, in the... 
 I showed you the notes... What I showed you in my notebook. 
 That was more of a list, dude. 
 Beast-core manifesto! 
 Manifesto. 
 Rule number three: we don't sell out! 
 Come on, man. 
 Douchebags. 
 [door rattles] 
 You know, my real family broke up three times 'cause of my three dads, and I thought this family would be together forever. 
 But I guess that's my fault for being a big, fat fool. 
 [door slams] 
 [sighs] 
 When do I get to give Johnny his makeover? 
 When do I meet Amor? 
 I need a copy of that song. 
 I have it in the sound booth. 
 You go get it. 
 Sony is not pinching pennies with us. 
 Look at this. This is Lavandier cognac. 
 This is like $5,000 a bottle. 
 Yeah, well, you might want to swig some of that down because your face is gonna be pretty sore after these treatments. 
 Well, such is the price of fame. 
 What do you got lined up? 
 Okay, we have a dermal ablation laser resurfacing, A micro-current under-peel, a liquid nitrous oxide injection, and some lipotripsy radial shocks. 
 Sounds like you're working on a car. 
 We are. A 1992 Chevy Impala. 
 But by the time we get done with you, you are gonna be a shiny, new 2016 Ferrari. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Diggin' your demo, dog. 
 That sh1t is on fleek, yo. 
 Amor : I'ma rework the beat, play with it, kick it up, add some swavy new lines and sh1t. 
 That's what I do, dog. 
 [laughs] 
 That's cool. 
 "Swavy." I dig it, dog. 
 [chuckles] 
 Gigi : Who's directing the video? 
 My nigrum B-lap. 
 He fleek too. 
 What's "B-lap" stand for? 
 Bitches be lapping up his vids, yo. 
 He's done Rihanna, Timberlake. 
 Wow, that's pretty heavy company. 
 Amor : Yo, Sony say you the next big thing, G. 
 Your star on fleek, like, what? 
 Amor : You stoked, dog? 
 I'm fleeked. I'm fleeking out. 
 No, you're not. 
 I thought I was. 
 I'm definitely stoked. 
 It's all good, B. You get it.

 Do you know what EDM stands for? 
 Yes, I do. 
 "Extremely douchey music." 
 Not the way we're gonna do it. 
 We remix  What's My Name? 
 Look, we still use some of our animal sounds. 
 Only, we also use Gigi's vocal underneath from yesterday, which I recorded on my phone. 
 And we drive it with bass and drums and synth loops. 
 Yeah, it features a human voice. 
 But dig this: are we not animals? 
 Animals who are stealing songs. 
 We helped them write that song. 
 Dude, creative control, that's the reason we started beast-core in the first place. 
 All right, technically, we are animals. 
 I'm barely evolved. 
 I'm like a ape. 
 Yeah. 
 I spend half my time drawing pictures of genitalia. 
 I'm a cheetah. 
 [both chuckle] 
 Dude. 
 What? 
 I'm... I'm fast, dude. 
 I'm very fast on my feet. 
 Dude. 
 I'm very nimble. 
 You put a cheesecake on a stick, watch how fast I am. 
 You're not a cheetah. You're like a panda.

 I've been a panda my whole life. 
 I'm a cheetah. I'm a cheetah, or I'm out. 
 That's it. 
 Who's my cheesecake cheetah? Come on. 
 You're getting too excited. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm sorry for yelling at you. 
 I know. 
 All right, so how do we make money off of this? 
 Well, I think that we use some of the cache that we got from the first beast-core gig. 
 We use all those emails from those fashion types. 
 We invite a lot of downtown hipsters and stuff. 
 We do an EDM event. 
 We throw it here, redo the entire space inside. 
 You and me deejay. 
 I'm telling you, hot DJs make, like, major cabbage, bro. 
 I'm talking like 10 grand a day. 
 They see us. They love us. 
 They give us gigs galore for 10 grand a day. 
 We can't deejay EDM gigs, okay? 
 We're too old. I got fired for being too fat. 
 You got fired for looking like Frank Zappa's grandfather. 
 His father. Dude, his dad, please. 
 I'm sorry. All right. All right. 
 Anyway, I got that angle covered. 
 How old are the guys from Daft Punk? 
 Nobody knows. 
 Exactly. 
 [chuckles] I got it. 
 [growling] 'Cause we're beast-core.

 Okay, this is what we're doing? 
 Let me see.
