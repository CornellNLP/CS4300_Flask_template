 Gigi : Wait, what do you mean, call you every day? 
 Call you every day to listen to you bitch and moan about what I'm doing with my life, with my money that you gave me? 
 "With no strings attached." 
 Do you remember when you said that? 
 Okay, bye. 
 Let me guess. Your mom. 
 [laughs] I... I really... I can't take it. 
 Every... everything she says to me is, you know, what I'm doing wrong and... 
 Okay, can I just say one thing? 
 Sure. 
 She's the person who raised you alone, and... 
 Listen to me... very beautiful, talented, and caring woman, who I have nothing but respect and admiration for, okay? 
 She's not coming here, is she? 
 Whoa, I have 9,327 followers on Twitter. 
 Holy sh1t. How did you get that many? 
 You know that picture I had you show Flash of me in a hot-pink bikini? 
 Yeah. 
 I tweeted it. 
 That's cheating. 
 Dad, if you had that bikini and you had this body, and you looked that good in that picture, you wouldn't tweet it out? 
 You just made such a Mom face. 
 That's not a Mom face. That's... what? 
 If your mom is making that face, it's because she took it from me. 
 This is my face. 
 Okay. 
 That's a Dad face. 
 Okay. 
 What were you playing? 
 I was playing this new melody that Flash and I have been working on. 
 Can I hear it? 
 Sure. 
 Play it for me. 
 Okay. 
 [gentle piano music] 
 Go ahead. Sing something. 
 I don't know it. I can't do it. 
 No, whatever comes into your head. 
 Okay.

 I like it. I think it's great. 
 I'm not good at that. 
 It was remixed old song lyrics. 
 No, it doesn't matter. 
 This is how Flash and I do it. 
 One guy has the melody or the harmony idea, and we just vocalize whatever comes into our head. 
 You can change it later, and this helps me with you, because I can get inside your head and get some input for when I try to write in your voice. 
 So we're gonna start doing this. 
 We're gonna start jamming together. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Get that idea down. 
 Great. 
 Okay. 
 Do you love me, Dad? 
 Well, I mean, of course I... You know, I love you. 
 You're my daughter. Why... what do you mean? 
 Wow. 
 What? 
 Okay, you don't love me. 
 That's not... I just said I love you, honey. 
 No, you stuttered a lot, and you phumperered, and you said, "I'm your... you're my daughter, so, of course." 
 I was not... 
 That's not... 
 I took a thoughtful pause, because... 
 To think about what? 
 Because it obviously is a very... It's a... it's a... you know... 
 Wow. 
 It's a question that needs to be answered... listen to me. 
 Of course I love you. You're my daughter. 
 That's an excuse. That's... that's... 
 That's not an excuse. That's a fact, okay? 
 Wow, I feel stupid. 
 Ah... do you love me? 
 Dad, I moved hallway across the [bleep] country to find you. 
 Of course I love you. I've loved you my whole life. 
 I've been in love with the videos and the pictures and the music my entire life. 
 But, honey, that's not the same thing. 
 Yes, it is. 
 No, it's not. 
 Listen to me, okay? 
 See, you're in love with the idea of me. 
 You're in love with the idea of coming to New York and rock and roll and show business. 
 That's not the same thing. 
 Dad... 
 The longer you know me, the more you're gonna find things about me that you dislike. 
 That's bullshit. 
 That's true. 
 That's bullshit; just because you hate yourself doesn't mean I have to hate you. 
 Okay, I don't hate myself. 
 Ava loves you. 
 Ava's loved you for a long time. 
 Why does she still love you if everyone stops loving you. 
 That's different. 
 How is it different? 
 [sighs] 
 You're looking for something, and I don't want you to get your hopes up. 
 I'm a [bleep] up guy. 
 One final time, okay? 
 Very simple: yes or no. 
 Do you love me or not? 
 I love you, okay? But... 
 And I like you, I like you a lot, okay, and... 
 Oh, my God. 
 Listen to me, a lot, a lot. 
 Whatever. 
 It's complicated. It's not simple, okay? 
 Okay. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm texting Flash. I'm getting a drink. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 I love you. 
 I love you. Do you want me to sing it?

 Whew. 
 That was better than blow. 
 [door slams] 
 What's the point of having a phone? 
 What? 
 We called you, like, 9 million times. 
 I... I was working on the song. I turned my phone off. 
 What's the problem? 
 There's a story on the internet... 
 Since, like, three hours ago... 
 Saying that you died. 
 What? 
 Yep, choked to death. 
 And on a chicken bone. 
 "Died in his own kitchen." 
 Who broke that story? 
 Oh, it's all over the place. 
 Really? Like, where? 
 Ira : Well, there's a lead story with a photo on the Slicing Up Eyeballs site, small mentions on DatPiff, and then something called Stiffs.com. 
 That's it? 
 Oh, my God. Classic. Not enough for him. 
 I'm thinking about the legacy of the band. 
 If I die, you know, there should be a lot of... 
 Did Rolling Stone say anything? 
 Honey, nobody reads Rolling Stone anymore. Phil Chevron, when he died from the Pogues last year, they have him a color photo, a big one, and Peaches Goldof got her own page, and she's not even a goddamn musician. Well, let's look on the bright side. They're both dead, and you're not. You're right. You're right. I should be thankful. Let's have a drink. This early? I just dropped dead and came back to life, okay? I think I deserve a little party, all right? What? Yeah, um, we think you may want to consider staying dead for business purposes. Really? Sales of s*x & Drugs shot up 400% on iTunes in the last three hours. Holy sh1t. How many albums did we sell? 402. But it's gonna grow. So you just lay low here for 48 hours, let it simmer, we make a little cash, maybe get the brand out there again, then you miraculously survive. So you guys want me to pretend I'm dead so that we can make money off my supposed corpse. Yes. Yeah. Okay, you know what, honey? We don't have to do it. Yeah, sorry, Dad. I mean, it's creepy, right? It's not creepy. It's a plan. It's creepy. It's unbelievably creepy. Yeah. Choking on a chicken bone. We've got to come up with a much cooler way for me to die, okay? [knock at door] Ava : Oh, you've got to... go, go, go. Get in the bedroom, in the bedroom. Go. Ava, Ava, oh, Ava. I'm so sorry. It's gonna be okay. [clears throat] What's with the hug, asshole? The hug... I was comforting a grieving widow. And the flowers? This is a grief bouquet. It's not flowers. A grief bouquet? So you didn't choke on a chicken bone? No, I didn't choke on a chicken bone. You know what I did? I'll tell you what I did. I got electrocuted by an amp. Flash : Been done: Les Harvey, Stone the Crows. Okay, I died in a private plane crash. That's Lynyrd Skynyrd. Uh... helicopter. Stevie Ray Vaughan. All right, so I... I drowned. Jeff Buckley. Jesus Christ. All the hippest ways to die have been taken. Guys, I'm not overdosing. That's way too cliché. What if somebody shot you? [scoffs] Who would want to shoot me? Seriously, guys? I mean, I know there's a lot of residual anger from the old days, but one of you guys would actually shoot me? Think how dope that story would be. "Lead guitar player shoots lead singer" would make the Stones and Aerosmith look like total pussies. Suck on that, Oasis. So typical. Why can't the bass player be the guy who shoots the guy? I don't know; assassination sounds really cool. Such a great name for a band: The Assassins. Yeah. We actually get to shoot him? Ira : No, no, we fake-assassinate him, and then he fake-survives the surgery. And then we form a real band called The Assassins. Ira : We will get a spike on old Heathens albums from the conspiracy freaks. Plus, it's a great origins story for Gigi's new band. Ira : This is something I can work with. It's pretty awesome, honey. I'm down. Yeah, me too. What, I don't get a vote? Technically, you're dead. Gigi : Listen to me, okay? We could be making history here. This could be even cooler than Biggie and Tupac. Your own guitar player shoots you dead? No one will ever forget you. You'd be a rock-and-roll legend forever. You know what? I really do love you. "My deepest sympathy. If you need anything, just call. Love, Richie." How you know Richie Sambora, honey? Oh, we met in the '80s just once before I knew you. Guess I made an impression, huh? Guess so. Hey, hey, Dad. What? Rolling Stone online just mentioned you. Aha. What did they say, honey? You watch now, baby girl. You're about to see your dad's true and lasting legacy, okay? Ava : That's outrageous. I know; what is that, like, 1/8 of a page? Ava : "Influential singer Johnny Rock found dead." There it is: "influential." Huh? What did I say? Hey, look at that: "Daughter Found Smokin' Hot!" Gigi : Wow, it's, like, everywhere. Here, click that video link. Matt : Rock never became famous, but in New York City's early '90s music scene and beyond, he was infamous for his ability to break up every single band he started. The Heathens broke up the same day their first record was released. The Johnny Rock Show imploded one week before signing their record deal due to a series of violent vomiting incidents. The Johnny Rock Affair did sign a record deal but never made it into the studio after their bass player entered a medically induced coma. And as Rock aged, the critically acclaimed band Skinny Bitch couldn't survive his inability to finish a single show. That's a bunch of bullshit. It's really sad. He was a nice guy, real talented. He as a bit of a mess, but we all were back in the day. You knew Joan Jett? Oh, yes, I did. She's so badass. You have no idea. When did you meet Joan Jett? When did I meet Joan Jett? I told you about when I met Joan Jett. It was... Ira, what was that, like... I'm thirsty. Who's thirsty? I want a drink. It was, like... How do you know Joan Jett? Bam and I... Bam... Bam, right, remember we, um, we... It was a benefit, right, Bam? What was it for, the thing? I would like a macaroon right now. He's hungry. He's just a little hungry. That's all. Bedroom? Oh, yeah. When did you sleep with Joan Jett? Okay, relax, relax, relax. It was a long time ago. Uh-huh, before or after we met? [sighs] After we met, yeah. Okay, okay, you kicked me out, and there was a benefit for The Diabetics. Remember that band? We were gonna get the drummer some new feet. Joan was there. Everybody was drunk. And it was just s*x. Just s*x with Joan [bleep] Jett. Honey, honey, listen to me. How was it, John? Honey, you don't want to know. How was it, John? It was great. Oh, yeah, I'm sure it was. She said it was great. She's into girls. Did you even ask if she would be willing to do a three-way? No. Oh, you selfish son of a bitch. You never told me you were friends with Richie Sambora. Because I'm not friends with Richie Sambora. I just... met him in the... Oh, my God. You [bleep] Richie Sambora. Oh, no... okay, but this was before... This was before I knew you. I don't give a sh1t, honey. They were a hair band. Oh, no, they were the hair band, John, okay? It was the '80s. Fringe leather jackets were hot. He had fringe leather pants. We wore the same eyeliner and the same brand of leopard-print thongs. Ew. Oh, ew. Who else do I not know about? Go ahead. Who else? Bon Jovi. Jon Bon Jovi? What, did you sleep with the whole friggin' band? No, I didn't sleep with the whole freakin' band? The bass player was an asshole. [whimpers] 
 
 Hey! Hey! Gigi went up to the roof. You might want to go talk to her. She's taking the news pretty hard. It's got to be hard even to pretend like your dad's dying. Yeah, no, it's not that. She's anxious. I booked her and the band at the Glasslands for a special four-song set tomorrow night. Oh, like, a memorial tribute thing to me? It's a tribute to her Twitter feed and my relationship to the guys at Bowery Presents. Oh, okay. But there is gonna be, like, a memorial tribute thing to me... Go talk to your daughter. Okay. Awesome. Great. Hey, you don't want to do the show? No, I want to do the gig, but when Ira mentioned it, I freaked. Okay, freaky is normal. No, I... I don't know. I just feel like I don't know the songs. I feel like I can't do it. I feel like I don't want to freak out in front of everybody and freeze on stage, and I think Mom was right. I think I never should have done it. I shouldn't have come here. I can't do it, Dad. Okay, come here. No, Dad, no. Shh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Chill out. Relax, okay? This is completely normal. This is what you're gonna do. Tonight go over the songs again. You'll go to soundcheck tomorrow with the band, like, an hour early; you'll settle in. You're gonna be fine. Did you ever get nervous before big gigs? Yeah, you have to get... If you don't get nervous, that's when you should start worrying, because it's part of the... Butterflies is part of the thing. But you never went on stage and freaked out and froze? Nah, I loved every minute of it. But then I don't understand. How did you destroy every band that you were ever in? I didn't destroy the bands. I dug the bands. The bands were... You know, they broke up. Yeah, well, Mom told me you had a fear of success. Why would I have a fear of success? I don't know, because you're afraid of change. Yeah, how about your mom? She was the one... She had the fear of success. She had to move to Ohio to get away from it. Yeah, she moved to Ohio, which was a giant change. Did you ever hear the story of Jonah and the Whale? Yeah, I think I saw it. That was that pretentious indie flick with Jeff Daniels as the asshole dad in Brooklyn? No, it's from the Bible. It's... okay, basically, God tells Jonah that he has to go warn this city of sinners. I don't... I forget the name. Let's just say it's Brooklyn. Because he's gonna smite them. Okay. Smite them? But Jonah doesn't want to do it. So he jumps into a boat to escape his fate, and the whale eats him, and he gets trapped in the whale's belly. So then he besieges God to come save him, so God has the whale puke him up onto the shore, and Jonah goes to Williamsburg, and he tells everyone to stop acting like hipster jerk-offs, and he becomes a big hero; he saves the day. God lets them all live, and that's what it was. He was afraid of change. He was afraid of his destiny. This is a thing. This is, like, a true, psychological thing. It's called a Jonah Complex. I can't believe you haven't heard of this. sh1t. I wonder if I was afraid. Dad, listen to me. I am your whale, okay? I am your second chance. I am... I am spitting you back up onto the shore. You are? 'Cause now we actually sound like we're in the shitty Jeff Daniels movie. Ugh. God, I hope I don't inherit your complex. What, the... the fear thing? Why would you inherit that? Well, because I got Mom's hair and your eyes. I got Mom's tits and your ass. You know what? There's something else you got from your mom. What? Balls. Big, brass, lady balls. Yeah? Yeah. That's why I know you can do this. [inhales] Okay. [phone buzzing] What's that? It's probably Ava. Oh, it is. Oh, wow. Greg Dulli sent her some flowers. What? Yeah. Asshole. God damn it. Come on. They're bigger than the last ones. I got this I like it too. Hey. How's she doing? Good. What are you doing here? I couldn't not come down and support her. Oh, she'll do fine. Hey. Hey. How you doing? I'm all right. Yeah? Come here. You're gonna crush it. Ira : Johnny. You're gonna be great. Gigi : Oh, hi. Hi. You're Johnny Rock's daughter, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah, I'm Gigi. Yeah, well, you know, the whole music scene is talking about you, and I had to come down for myself and see what all this noise is about. So have a good time, but I need to say, I'm really sorry to hear about your dad. Oh, that's very sweet. Oh... no, no. Joan, hey, it's me. Me who? It's me. It's Johnny, Johnny Rock. So you're not dead? Oh, he is on the inside. No, it was a hoax. Oh, you must be Ava. Yeah. Hey, Joan, yeah. It's cool. She... she knows about us. Yeah. She knows what? Well, that you two slept together. [laughs] You told them that? Well, yeah, of course. Yeah. Well, that's all we did was sleep together. What do you mean? We went to my place, and we were really wasted, and you were really drunk, and we got into bed, and you couldn't really, you know, perform, then you fell asleep. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You said it was great. Yeah, that was the next day, when you asked me. I needed to get you out of there, man. [laughter] All set, guys. Come on. Let's do this, Gigi. That was a gift. Nice to meet you, Miss Jett. Nice to meet you too. I'll see you in a second. man : Gigi, Gigi, yeah. Gigi. Yeah. This is your first big gig, right? Yes. You nervous? Well, listen, just remember, all the guys out there, they want to [bleep] you, and all the girls out there, they want to be you, so just relax, have fun, do your music, and seduce them all, and you got it. Well, that's a funner way to think about it. It was really nice meeting you. Good meeting you too. Good luck, sweetheart. Kick some ass, girl. All right. Hey, Ava. Hi. Nice jacket. Nice boots. Thanks, Joan. See ya. Yeah, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with Joan. Hmm. Joan has Alzheimer's. I just tweeted that the shooting was a hoax. 864 retweets. You are gonna be bigger than ever. Now, I'm opening a Twitter account for you: @gigisdad, @gigisdad. You just send it out, people like you, and... Did you set this whole thing up? Well, I figured your career was already dead. Why not you? And I knew someone would pick up on Gigi, maybe hear her demo. Voila, man, voila. [band warming up] [cheers and applause] Yeah, come on. [applause] Hi. Thanks for coming, everybody. I just recently got to know my dad. But he was the entire reason I moved to New York. And I think it kind of paid off. Anyway, he... he wrote this song for me about us, so I hope you like it.
