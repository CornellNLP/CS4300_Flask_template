 Bull :  I'm Dr. Jason Bull. I'm not a lawyer. I'm an expert in what's called trial science. I study the jury's behavioral patterns. I know what they're thinking before they do. Everything my team learns gets plugged into a matrix, which allows us to assemble a mirror jury that is scary in its predictive efficiency. The verdict you get depends on me. And that's no bull. 
 (tires screeching) 
 (metal crashes) 
 Man :  Are you crazy? 
 Do you want him to be made fun of for the rest of his life? Woman :  This is your son! Man :  Karen! (children laughing) Excuse me. Man :  I don't want to talk about this. This is the 30th time we've talked about this. (groans) Woman :  John... Stop. Man :  I'm defending my son. Man :  Stop what? Woman :  Listen to me, this is your son! (exhales) (children shouting) Man :  Did you see the way that guy's treating him? Karen. Karen! Oh, God. Karen! Karen! Oh, God, my wife! My wife, she needs help! (sirens approaching) My God. Oh, my God. Call 911. Call 911. (echoing): Call 911! Defense attorney :  ...the prosecution has attempted to throw roadblocks in front of my client  at every turn, in an outrageous attempt... Bull : Ah, Judge Lamkin. Can almost make civil court tolerable. That's three days in a row her eyes fluttered at 3:30, only to perk up again after her 4:00 p.m. tea. You don't know that's tea. Either way, we need to see our best witnesses in the morning. And it's tea. Lamkin only has one drink a day, after dinner, single-malt scotch. And you know that how, exactly? Never mind. Lamkin : The prosecution's witness had a change in schedule. We will resume Wednesday. Your Honor, the prosecution knew the officer's patrol shifted. This means four more days in jail. Lamkin : Mr. Foster, you've made this argument three times, three different ways now. Wednesday stands. It's just a shame the way they throw these public defenders to the wolves. Uh, Mr. Public Defender... In this county, lawyers sit on the right. Lamkin : Watch it, Bull. Sorry, Your Honor. Dr. Bull. Oh, I'm gonna go get the car. Judge Lamkin, always a pleasure. And that is a new robe... Rag & bone? How would you like to do me a favor? A case in Judge Bergen's court. I was hoping it would be a little more interesting, but go on. Some poor guy was in a car accident, and his wife was killed. The DA's going after him for vehicular manslaughter. And you'd throw out the case. I would. Bergen's not so forgiving. I thought you and your team could jump on board, at least make it a fair fight. Well, Judge, you know my plate is very full. I have a trial coming up in your court. I could always postpone it. And suddenly my plate is empty. (chuckles) Do we have a lawyer? Can't afford one. So it's whoever draws the long straw at Legal Aid. (phone ringing) What about that guy? I think he was sworn in at the bar on his way to court this morning. Bull : Hmm. Perfect. I love a fresh lump of clay. And what, you're Michelangelo? Michelangelo's  David  was chiseled from a very large, imperfect block of marble other artisans wouldn't touch. I look forward to your masterpiece. Hmm. John and Karen Phillips. Married ten years, one son, Carter. Luckily, Carter was not in the car at the time of the crash. Cable : God. How fast was he going? 11 miles an hour over the speed limit. That doesn't sound reckless. Well, I never speed. It's called taking the subway. The police report says there was a sign warning cars to slow down, and he'd had a drink at a barbecue beforehand. Blood alcohol? 04... one beer. Below the legal limit. Marissa : To prosecute for vehicular manslaughter, they'd have to prove that John purposely drove in an agitated state. I don't get it. What's their case? Bull : Exactly. How often does the DA push for manslaughter on a traffic accident? Less than five percent of the time. This is the question. What is motivating the DA to prosecute? I'm on it. I'm tempted to hack into the DA's private server and then... just give me an hour and an iced quad espresso and I'll have something, okay? I never know whether to be scared or impressed. First instinct's usually the best. Baseball dad, devoted husband. Worked double shifts as an HVAC installer, just to take his family to Coney Island once a year. And then tragedy took all that away. John and Karen were driving home from a team barbecue one day, and... But thank God their son Carter had stayed behind with friends. They rounded a bend... Must be hard to hear. Well, it was harder losing Karen. I don't understand what this is. This is all part of trial science. We test out your case. Find the right strategy, narrative. My attorney isn't even here. Legal Aid lawyers often have 30 to 40 active cases. He doesn't need to be here. (sighs) This is so surreal. I lost my wife in a car accident and they think I'm a killer? Karen was everything to me. If I go to jail, my son ends up in foster care. Bull : Hey. We're not gonna let that happen. This is a process. And it works. Come on. (thud) (whistles) Pretty sophisticated equipment. Not cheap, either. Why are you doing this for me? Well, it isn't charity. You're getting me on the good side of a judge who's presiding over a very lucrative suit next month. And I'm not giving you any of my share. More importantly, we don't believe in letting people go to jail for an accident. Everyone has their reasons. Carter : Dad? John : Hey. Hey, buddy. Listen, I'm a little short on cash. Can I settle up with you next week? Babysitter : No problem. I'll see you Monday. Bye, Carter. How was school? Okay. So... Brought your lawyer, huh? I'm not a lawyer. Bull  (chuckling): Yeah, that's right. You're probably too smart to be a lawyer. Hey. Don't bias a nine-year-old. I'm still eight. In five months and six days, I'll be nine. John : All right. See you soon, Dr. Bull. Carter, it's time to go. We have to get to your class. Nice to meet you, Carter. Cable. You said you found something? I found a troll. You and I have very different definitions of "something." Cable : This guy is on the Internet defending John, saying there's more to this story. How would he know? Well, that's why I started chatting with him. He's pointing a finger at this guy named Trevor Dormit. Bull : The state assemblyman. Cable : I asked him what Dormit had to do with the crash and he's being pretty evasive. Is Dormit on the witness list? No. Hmm. All right. Maybe he should be. Print out everything you have on him. Like on paper? No. Banana leaves. Yes, on paper. Doing this old school. Gonna need the visual. TV announcer :  Line drive to left,  and that's a drive and a run. Man : Come on. Yeah! Assemblyman Dormit. I'm Dr. Jason Bull. I'm sorry, there was nobody outside there. Marcy will be back in a minute; she'll be able to help you. This will just take a moment. Um, a friend of mine is on trial for manslaughter. Uh... This office could look into that, but really that is an issue for the DA. No. I know, that's why I'm here. Because I read all these online posts, and it seems you're involved in the case against John Phillips? I don't know who that is. Well, that's the guy who was in this tragic accident and he lost his wife. Oh. The maniac drunk driver. And you were there. Yeah. Dormit :  Just a few cars back. Thank God I wasn't any closer, Well, I don't know if you realize John was driving home from his eight-year-old son's baseball game. A lot of criminals are fathers, sadly. Well, he's... not a drunk driver. Not a maniac, certainly, not a criminal at all. He's just a single father now. He's lost his wife. Oh. You can leave your information with Marcy. Marcy (in distance) : Assemblyman Dormit's office. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. One... one last question. Are you the chief sponsor of the road improvement bill for Nassau County? Because it seems that you stand to benefit greatly from characterizing John's accident as a criminal act. In fact, it seems you're the reason John's on trial in the first place. Marcy. Marcy : Yes, sir? Call security, please. This man's refused repeated instructions to leave the office. He might be armed. Marcy : Right away, sir. That won't be necessary. You know, before you came in here, I was on the fence about taking the time to testify against Phillips, but now, I guess, I'll see you in court. I'm looking forward to that. ♪ ♪ Bull :  Hey there, Marissa, I'm putting you on speaker. Marissa : How'd you get Dormit to testify? Classic high-conflict behavior. Instead of resolving problems, he likes to escalate them. Well done! You can put him on the stand just like you wanted. Now that you got your wish, what's next? (siren wailing) Officer (over megaphone) : Police. Pull over. Bull (sighing) : I'll let you know when I get back. First I have to pay for my wish. Marissa : What do you mean? Officer (over megaphone) : Police! Pull over now. Bull :  Dormit must have told local law enforcement I was driving through. Bye. License and registration. Sure thing, Officer. Do you mind if I ask what I did wrong? I don't know if you're aware of New York laws, sir, but it's a hands-free state. In the car. I assume it's safe to use our hands other places. Please step out of the car. Can I use my hands? You're a funny guy, huh? Hi. Oh, good. We're pooling our resources to pay your fine. FYI, Marissa wouldn't give up her watch. I take it the assemblyman had something to do with your citation. A small price to pay for the pleasure of his company in court. So, the prosecution's plan is to get the jury's attention focused on the small details. Yep. Beer, the speeding. Looking angry as he passed Dormit. But now we put those details into a larger context. With Dormit on the stand? And with a jury full of people who don't get hung up on the details. Like Benny. Thanks? Bull : No judgment. That's just how the Benny brain works. What brand of shoes was Marissa wearing yesterday? What color was her jacket? Benny : I don't remember. But she looked great. Thank you. Danny : Manolos. And a winter white jacket over an emerald crew neck. Very elegant. Marissa : Okay. That's probably enough about my fashion choices. I take it we wouldn't want a detective on our jury. Bull : No. On this one we need people who only think of the big picture. Intuitive thinkers. Jury selection is never perfect. That's why we have a head start. This is tomorrow's jury pool. How did you get... I mean, nobody gets this in advance. We do. Marissa : Better not to ask. Cable's running through their social media. Court records... anything that tells us who these people are. And who to avoid. But in voir dire, you can't just ask people if they get hung up on details. You're gonna ask these questions. Gil :  Do you prefer  cooking or baking? Mr. Foster, please. I'm hungry. Don't try my patience before lunch. Bull :  Judge Bergen's probably gonna give you a little bit of flack. Don't worry. You can ask anything you want in court. Cooking or baking? Bull :  Bakers are precise. They have to follow the recipe exactly, details matter. Cooking. It's more about the feel of the dish. I sort of wing it, though, 'cause I never have the right stuff in my fridge. Gil :  So people who cook  will be more open to John's story. Cooking or baking? Uh, baking. But not all that vegan gluten-free, taste-free crap. We move to strike this juror. Bull :  Don't smile. You can't smile. You didn't just win the lottery. You struck a juror. You give anything away, the prosecution will catch on. So just show me. Oh. Yeah, but don't look nervous. Show me your neutral face. That's more sad clown. We'll work on this. Don't think about it. (sighs) Oh, boy. Juror : Cooking. No patience for baking. Acceptable to the defense. Bergen : Mr. Mercado? Acceptable, Your Honor. Bergen : It looks like we have a jury. Participating in a criminal case as a juror is an important duty. We will attempt to keep any inconvenience to you at a minimum. I would like to remind you as a juror there are some guidelines you need to follow. I spend my weekends bird watching. I spend my weekends bird watching. I'm married with four kids. I'm married with four kids. George/Mirror George : I am an account executive. Still single. We have identified the 12 mirror jurors. How'd we fare? Mostly good. However... Sorry. ...the mirror jury has led me to believe that this juror could be an issue. Arthur Jolene. His pulsed spiked when he saw that John was speeding. He pays all his bills on time. And... He's a birdwatcher. Oy. He's kept a hand-written log for the last 19 years. He can spot all 476 species in New York. And he's still single? Can you believe it? Speaking of that winter white jacket and Manolos... Oh, not again. Wait a minute. I want in on this. She's worn a new outfit twice this week. And she left the office at 7:30 last night, which never happens, so what's going on? I am pretty sure this is why the phrase "none of your business" was originally invent... (gasps) (laughing) Sorry. Don't know my own strength. That was at least 16 feet. Yes, it was. All right, big guy. You're at bat. Show me what ya got. Now, I hear that you're a Mets fan. I'm not gonna hold that against you. Who's your favorite player? Cespedes. He's averaging almost 300, but July 5 he hit 305, and April 29, starting up against the Giants, he hit 313. (exhaling): Wow. Nice stats. Show me your stance. You all right there, kiddo? Getting ready takes a sec. Warm up for you. (quietly mimics ball whooshing) Ah, man, missed it. That was a good cut. Bad pitch. So you got some Major League scouts looking at you? Nah, I'm not on the team anymore. Oh. All right. Let's take another cut. Eyes on the ball this time. (mimics ball whooshing) Whoa! Talked to all the parents from the game? Uh, minus two who are more evasive. But we have character witnesses. John checks out like father of the year. Anyone mention why John took Carter off the team? One dad thinks it has to do with the accident, the trial. Talk to everyone. Find out what kind of player Carter was. 
 
 (doorbell rings) Danny : Lurla Gray? (wind chimes tinkle) Maybe. Are you the one who called about John Phillips? Your sons played baseball together. Ma'am? I worked for the FBI. This gnome you have guarding your door isn't gonna deter me. I told them I was done talking. I don't want to be involved. Told who? The DA. He promised to protect me if I handed over the video. Ma'am, what video? (men arguing indistinctly) (overlapping arguing) ...I want to win games out there. Listen, maybe you find a different sport for your son. Okay. That's not good, John. Attacking a coach supports the prosecution's case that he drove in an agitated state. And then you got in the car? This is a detail the jury may have a hard time ignoring. ♪ ♪ Look, I know it looks bad, but there's a perfectly good... I don't know, maybe it's not very good, but... That guy there, Gary, he's one of the dads that coaches Carter's team. And he benches Carter every game until the last inning, when it doesn't even matter. Is it a competitive league? These kids are eight years old. But he's acting like they're going to the World Series. He, he has the same three kids riding the pine every game. Not his kid, I bet. So you shoved him. John : I only went to go talk to him. In private so it wasn't a thing in front of the other parents, but then he starts acting like it was my fault. Carter's fault. And then he says, "Oh, maybe your kid should find another sport." And, uh... I just snapped. Bull : John. These are the kinds of things we need to know. Danny : The prosecution has the video. And Mercado's gonna lead with it at trial. It'll make the case that you were in an agitated state before you got behind the wheel. This gives the prosecution grounds for manslaughter. We'll be ready. For whatever they throw at us. In the car crash that killed... No, nope, nope, nope, sorry. I kno... I know you said you were gonna jump in, I just assumed I'd get a whole sentence in first. Don't use the word "crash." It's "accident," "tragedy," "loss." Those are the magic words. Especially around Arthur Jolene. Who? Juror Number Two. And the other two who will cluster around him. Cluster? Jurors Number Eight and Nine will follow the strongest personality with whom they share similar traits. That's Arthur. (clears throat) This tragic accident... Why are you standing there? I'm talking to Arthur. Okay. But when you're talking about John, it actually helps to stand near him. That'll subconsciously associate John with the positive words in the jurors' brains. Okay. But not when you mention the negative details. Like the fight with the coach. Oh, no. They didn't have a fight. He confronted a hot-headed coach who was taking the game too seriously. (sighs) Will it even matter where I stand once they've seen that video? Everything matters. The coach won't testify, so Danny's talking to him now to find out why. John's right, I want to win baseball games, and there's no rule that says you got to play all the kids the same amount of time. But I don't blame John for what happened. He's a decent guy, he means well. When you said that, the prosecution chose not to call you to the stand. I made it pretty clear that I don't want to get involved. John doesn't deserve this, and I feel for Carter. Even though you benched him? Ugh. The kid is terrible. And I don't want him to lose his dad to prison after he just lost his mom. Would you be willing to testify that you instigated the fight? (scoffs) No. John lost it. Don't get me wrong. Parents go bananas out there all the time. Last week a shortstop's dad was critiquing another kid's hitting, got a snow cone to the face. (chuckles) I told you, it doesn't make any of us look much better. Is there anything that you could tell me that might help? Well, I didn't tell the DA guy this, but Karen called right after from the car. And? She wanted to apologize. Had something to explain, but then John yelled at her and she hung up. Explain what? I don't know. Look, I wish him well. Thank you. So he fought with the coach and his wife before the accident? All part of the same fight. It's not helping. I debriefed the mirror jury after they saw the video, looks like we only have five of 12 on John's side. Three guiltys. Arthur Jolene, and the two clustering around him. Think the fight's clear evidence that John's an angry guy who shouldn't have gotten behind the wheel. Bull : John was angry. But he's not an angry guy, and the jury needs to see that. You working a theory? First, we have to dispense with Assemblyman Dormit. Assuming Gil follows the plan. Dormit eats lawyers like Gil for lunch. For breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day. I think it's lunch. Gil will not be eaten. Now, someone needs to go through John's insurance claims for the last five years. Medical. It's not exactly legal, is it? Well, then, it's a good thing no one here is doing it. Especially not... (calling): Cable! Cable :  Today? Judge Lamkin. I'll meet you guys in there. Now, you don't work at this courthouse. No. But I do live in Nassau County. Oh! You're taking my advice. Running for State Assembly. It's something I've wanted to do for years, but I never really thought I had a shot. Hmm. Are you sure about this? 100%. Then I'm off to file. Mercado : Assemblyman Dormit, can you identify the driver? Yeah, he's sitting right over there. Well, I was trying to switch lanes so he could pass, but he was already swerving around me. Nearly ran me off the road. Gave me an angry look. I thought maybe he was drunk. Objection, assumes facts not in evidence. And actually, we have John's blood alcohol level on record as being below the legal limit, so, assumes lies not in evidence. Bergen : That's not actually a thing, Mr. Foster, but point taken. Mercado : And then what happened? Dormit : Then I saw the road sign. It said "Slow: Congestion Ahead." So I slowed down. And as I rounded the bend I saw the huge crash he'd caused. Mercado : Thank you. That's all. Gil : Mr. Dormit, would you happen to know how many drivers are prosecuted for car accidents in this district? Not off the top of my head, no. Well, even when there's a fatality, it's less than five percent of the time, right? I guess Something like that. Which would certainly makes it seem like John's being unfairly singled out. Get to a question, Mr. Foster. Gil : Do you have an agenda, Mr. Dormit? After the accident, did you call your friend and golf buddy, the district attorney, and personally request that John be charged? That is moronic. Name calling is not the same as giving an answer. Cable :  Gil put his first points on the board. Look at the spike in vitals on his mirror juror's biometer. A crack in Arthur Jolene's cluster. Not hard to tap into people's outrage against the abuse of power. Juror number nine swore he'd never vote again after the last election. How many speeches did you give after John's wreck in support of a new highway project in your district? I give a lot of speeches. Six. By the way, I love the slogan from your last election. "All roads lead to Dormit." It's catchy. You sponsored the roads. Objection. Relevance. The next words better be relevant, Mr. Foster. Mr. Dormit, do you have something to personally gain from John's conviction, perhaps having something to do with the road improvement bill for Nassau County that you sponsored? Isn't it true that your brother owns a concrete factory? I'm not saying there were kickbacks... Now, hold on... You hold on. Now, who the hell are you? Those projects were fair, created jobs... For your family. He's the criminal. Right there. He is. Marissa says we gained a few. Where's John? He went outside to cool off. Can't blame him for not being Dormit's biggest fan. Remember the first thing I told you when you joined TAC? Uh, you said never stop at a client's first confession. It's only the beginning. Bull : John. Hey, Dr. Bull. Hey. John, slow down. Hey... it's one thing to stare down Dormit in court, it's another to confront him in his car. I don't care anymore, okay? What would a jury think? You have to think. He is ruining my life. Shh, shh. He doesn't care about your life. He's a political opportunist, okay? And that may be pathetic and awful, but he's not your biggest problem. You are. John, what were you and Karen fighting about before the crash? It was nothing. I mean, she was mad that I went after the coach. Because he didn't know about Carter. There's nothing wrong with my son. You can hide it all you want, but it's all I see. Carter's had his challenges, hasn't he? He has some kind of, um, motor planning disorder. I know. He's been in physical therapy for the last two years. Three times a week. Mm. He's just as good as any of these other kids. He just has to work twice as hard. So... when he got benched, you know, I just... Yeah, but why don't you just tell the coach he needs a little extra help? Karen wanted to, but I-I... I-I don't want people treating him differently. But in the car,  she said that I was ashamed. Of my own son. And that's what you were fighting about... Coach (echoing) : Carter, watch your stance! Bull :  ...before the crash. This is something you have to tell the jury. They will understand, too. No. No. This stays between us. Have a seat. Look, I'll testify, but, uh... I don't see how I could possibly be a good witness. John, you and your wife loved each other very much. I've seen it in the photos, in the stories, everything Carter says. I know, but... And you had a fight. Like every other married couple on the planet. Dr. Bull, you don't understand. The way that we yelled... it was... It wasn't the first time that you fought about whether or not to tell someone about Carter's condition, was it? I know this isn't easy, but neither is hiding it. I'm not hiding it. I just... I want him to have a real childhood. I mean, you start talking to people, and... he doesn't get on a team, he gets singled out. You know, nothing should hold him back. That's what I want you to say on the stand. No. I'm... I'm not using my son to win the sympathy of strangers. I got to go to work. Hey, why aren't you bantering with your Internet troll friend? He, uh, went dark. Why? I thought he was following John's case. Gave you the Dormit intel. I know. I thought he'd be all excited about Dormit's flailing in court. He's a good hacker, too. But he's really hard to find. Well, you know what Bull would say? Something cryptic that takes me days to understand? Cable, when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. You're coming at it like a hacker. Right? Only looking online. But you got to think big picture. This guy's sympathizing with John. Why? Marissa : Gil's cross of Dormit convinced two fence-sitters that John is getting unfairly railroaded. Oof. I'm not sure we can get the other two if John won't explain the whole story behind the fight. If the jury hears the whole context, they'll see John as a loving father, not as an angry driver. But... without that, they'll default to the prosecution's version. Bull : And our cluster's still holding firm around Bird-man? Well, we observed jurors eight and two at a nearby cafeteria agreeing with each other that Gil's new cross of Dormit was weak at best. His mirror juror's still hung up on the road sign Dormit mentioned. Can't see how John missed it. So we'll do a better job at convincing him the sign's irrelevant. Bull : It's not that easy... He's not naturally an intuitive thinker, you can't change him in a day. It's like trying to get an introvert to be the life of the party. So what do we do? Let's forget about Arthur for the moment. Shore up our maybes. How? John said he won't talk. Correct. But we can have Gil bring up Carter's condition. You want me to ambush my own client on the stand? Gil... No. No way. My job is to tend to the needs of the client. Your job is to make sure that John does not rot in prison. Your job is to make sure that his son doesn't end up in foster care. Gary :  The game is done, all right? He has to sit on the bench... ...wasn't trying to do nothing. I want to win games out there. John : What is-what is this, the World Series? Gary : Listen, maybe you find a different sport for your son. (video shuts off) Gil : And then you shoved the coach? John : I pushed him. I know that that video looks awful and, uh, believe me, I'm not proud of it. Why do you think the coach doesn't want to play Carter as much as the other kids? John : I'm not saying that he's a top player, but Carter should be able to play more than just last inning. Carter had any trouble keeping up with the other kids? No. What's that supposed to mean? John, I have some documents here from Carter's developmental pediatrician. They speak to some challenges he's faced in the past 18 months. Tell us what was really going through your head when you went to talk to the coach. (sniffs) Carter has a motor planning disorder. He's a smart kid, he's the best kid in the world, it just takes him some extra practice to, uh... (sniffs) I'm sorry, I, um, I didn't come here today to talk about Carter. I just-I just never wanted him to be, uh, treated differently, to be seen as weak. Karen wanted me to tell people. And Karen was the smartest person that I know. Marissa : We won over the maybes, but Arthur is still hung up on the road sign. He needs one more detail to latch on to. I might have a lead on that. And you've been withholding? You're one to talk. What do you mean? Oh, the new dresses, leaving at 7:30. You're dating someone. And you're being unusually cagey about it. Yeah, don't make me do a deep dive. Hey, we have one rule around here. No investigating teammates. Danny : Oh. Then you shouldn't work with a team of investigators, lady. Arthur is not interested in my dating life. Can you please find something for him to focus on? I'm on it. Man : Hey! You're Austin. Do I know you? Yeah, virtually. We were talking online about your favorite assemblyman. I'm a friend of John Phillips. I... I got to go. Oh, yeah, you could. You're a really good hacker, Austin. You hid your identity perfectly. All but once. When you donated to Karen Phillip's memorial fund. It was supposed to be a dumb prank. I knew that Dormit would be driving by that day. He'd been tweeting about the fund-raiser all day. You... you really don't like the guy. My mom works at Bretner Library. Or she used to... until... Dormit demolished it to make room for that new highway interchange off Exit 7. Dormit says, "Who cares? Nobody reads books anymore anyways." So I thought I'd get back at him somehow. What did you do, Austin? ♪ ♪ Man : What the hell is that? "No need to read"? (laughs) Cable : We found this on Instagram. Austin hacked the sign. Man : Somebody's gonna get fired. Cable : "No Need to Read" is just the hacker's stupid joke for Dormit. It was there about 20 minutes before traffic clogged up enough to cause the accident. Once he realized what he had done, he switched it back. John, you really had no warning. This sign didn't say, "Slow: congestion ahead." This is it. This is the exact detail we needed, because Arthur's a rule-follower, and he'll know that our client did not break the rule. So we recall John back on stand? John? I can't do that. Why not? I... I don't think I ever saw the sign. I-I don't remember it. At all. Marissa : If you don't remember seeing it, so, the prosecution will say the hack doesn't matter. Recall John. Let 'em try. Mercado :  Isn't it odd, Mr. Phillips, that you're just  now remembering this hacked sign? It is, but so is being prosecuted for a car accident after losing my wife. After  killing  your wife, you mean. Objection! Bergen : Sustained. Mercado : Why didn't you tell us that the sign was hacked? Because you never saw it? Cable :  The only one to watch is Arthur. So far, he's still with the prosecution. Marissa :  Bull knows what he's doing. Mercado : Isn't there only one good reason why you missed the sign? Isn't it because you were driving under the influence? Objection! Overruled. Mercado : You had a drink, you were driving in a fit of rage... That's not what happened. You were so angry that you couldn't think straight. Otherwise, you would have seen that giant sign right in front of you, and Karen would still be alive, wouldn't she? That's not true! Do you remember seeing the sign, hacked or not? No. I don't remember seeing it. Then it doesn't matter  if  the sign was hacked. All right, this is the fun part. Right. The circus act. It's psychology, not a parade of elephants. It's just the closing argument. You can do this. You want me to lure the jury into a trap. That's a little bit like a circus. Follow my lead. The prosecution argues that the hacked sign doesn't matter... Gil :  The prosecution argues that  the hacked sign doesn't matter. Bull :  Because John didn't see it. Because John didn't see it. Bull :  And if he had seen it, well, obviously,  he would have remembered it. Gil : Right? Bull :  Wrong. Our brains take in thousands of pieces of information every minute, and our brains have to  unconsciously make choices. Unconsciously make choices. Bull :  And we focus on what matters. We focus on what matters. A sign that says "No Need to Read"? Well, it doesn't matter. Still, I understand that maybe you don't believe me. And I figured... this is too important a detail to just take on faith. So this morning, I actually removed a sign from this courtroom. It was big, and it was noticeable, and it's been on that wall for the entire length of this trial. So, can anyone tell me what it said? Nobody? Gil :  How can you be sure they won't remember? Okay, right. I should have learned to trust you and your witchcraft by now. It's not witchcraft. It's science. John read that road sign the way you all read that courtroom sign, but he dismissed it, just like you did, because it wasn't relevant. Just like this one. "A court officer must be present at all times." Judge : Mr. Foster, I'd appreciate it if you would return my sign now. Gil : Of course, but this wasn't actually a sign that was on the wall. This was. Objection. Clearly misleading the jury, Judge Bergen. That's my point, Mr. Mercado. It's relevant to our case. Mr. Foster, put back the sign. Gil : Absolutely, Your Honor. The point is,  they weren't relevant. They weren't relevant. So you had no memory of seeing them, or not seeing them. Just... like... John. Gil :  And I can assure you, I can assure you, had that road sign said something relevant, had it said, "Slow: congestion ahead," well, John would have remembered it, and reacted. Bull :  It would have saved Karen's It would have saved Karen's life. Man (on radio) :  This is 107.4 with your hourly news update. An acquittal today in the John Phillips manslaughter case involving the death of his wife Karen. The case proceedings may have opened up further legal action... Hey. I owe you... a lot. I told you, I'm already collecting from Judge Lamkin. Now, there is one thing you, uh, you need to do. Just tell me I don't have to reenact my fight with the coach. Oh, I'm not gonna make you do that. You just have to admit Karen was right. She knew the secret. Instead of hiding how Carter's different, maybe it's better to embrace it. He doesn't have to hit home runs to be happy. That was Daddy's joy. He wants to make you proud. He doesn't have to. We know that, but does he? Carter : Dad! Hey. Did you see my stance? Yeah. Buddy, you looked great. So, what about this batter? What's his average? 310, but his OBP is better. 415 for home games, and his slugging is 523. Awesome, right? Yeah. Covered in awesome sauce. All right, I'll see you later. ♪ So many times before... ♪ So, uh, what are the pitcher's stats? Carter : He's pretty good. I mean... John : The batter? Carter : He's not a stick in the ground, either. Player over there looks pretty tough. Carter : That one's good. ♪ And one heart won't give you up... ♪ Bull :  Here it comes. Oh, yeah. Mmm, mmm, mmm! You guys got pineapple again? Stop focusing on the details, Chunk. I could focus on the details if they weren't covered in pineapple. Ooh, hot! Ooh! There it is. All : Boo! So how's your ex-husband? It's tricky business, rekindling with Greg. Who told you? You did. You wore three different shades of green this week. That was his favorite color. Haven't worn green in a long time. I know it's probably a bad idea, and I promise I won't come to you again when things go south... You can always come to me. Thank you. Danny : Hey, guys, check this out. Have you seen this billboard? ♪ 'Cause I just need a kick start... ♪ Chunk : Judge Lamkin? She's running against Dormit in the next election. That's amazing. Awesome. Danny : Look at that. Benny : Wasn't that a billboard for Dormit? Cable : Austin's not the only hacker around here. ♪ And finally let the hurt begin ♪ 
♪ Tell me when the hurt begins ♪ 
♪ 'Cause honey won't you let me in. ♪
