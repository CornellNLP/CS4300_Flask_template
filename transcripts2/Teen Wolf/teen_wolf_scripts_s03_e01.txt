 Previously on Teen Wolf. 
 Scott : You can't just go around turning people into werewolves. 
 Derek : I can if they're willing. 
 Allison : Scott, I'm trying to break up with you. 
 Scott : It's okay, because I know we're gonna be together. 
 Derek : It's their symbol, and it means they're coming. 
 Isaac : Who? 
 Peter : An Alpha pack. And they're not coming. They're already here. 
 Braeden : Quiet. Stay with me. We're almost there. 
 Isaac : My neck. 
 Braeden : From their claws. It's how they share memories. 
 Isaac : But I don't remember anything. 
 Braeden : Also how they steal them. Listen to me, no matter what happens you hold on, okay? You hold on tight. 
 Isaac : I hear something. Someone's coming. Faster! Two of them. No! 
 Braeden : Remember what I said before?  
 Isaac : Hold on? 
 Braeden : Hold on! 
 Isaac : Whoa! 
 Braeden : Isaac? Stay with me! Isaac! Isaac! Get down! I thought I told you to hold on. 
 Tattooist : Boy, it's a good thing you drew me a picture. 
 Stiles :Hey, Scott, sure you don't want something like this? Too soon? Yeah. 
 Stiles : I don't know, man, are you sure about this? I mean, these things are pretty permanent, you know? 
 Scott : I'm not changing my mind. 
 Stiles : Okay, but why two bands? 
 Scott : I just like it. 
 Stiles : But don't you think your first tattoo should have some sort of meaning, you know, or something? 
 Scott : Getting a tattoo means something. 
 Stiles : I don't think that's... 
 Tattooist : he's right, tattooing goes back thousands of years. The tahitian word "tatua" means "to leave a mark." Like a rite of passage. 
 Scott : Yeah, you see? He gets it. 
 Stiles : He's covered in tattoos, Scott, literally. 
 Tattooist : Okay, you ready? You ain't got any problems with needles, do you? 
 Scott : Nope. 
 Stiles : I tend to get a little squeamish though, so... 
 Scott : Oh, man. 
 Stiles : You okay? 
 Scott : Kinda burns. 
 Stiles : Yes, you just had your skin stabbed about 100,000 times with a needle. 
 Scott : Yeah, but I don't think it's supposed to feel like this. 
 Stiles : Oh, God. 
 Scott : No, it's definitely not supposed to feel like this. Oh, I gotta take this thing off. 
 Stiles : No, no, no, no, Scott. Oh, Scott, please stop. Whoa, whoa. 
 Scott : Oh, no, what? No, no, come on. It healed. 
 Stiles : Ah, thank God. I hated it. Sorry. 
 Lydia : It is not a double date. It is a group thing. 
 Allison : Do they know it's a group thing? 'Cause I told you that I'm not ready to get back out there. 
 Lydia : You were in France and didn't do any dating for four months?  
 Allison : Did you? I mean, after... 
 Lydia : Do not say his name. 
 Allison : Is he okay? I mean, did everything work out? 
 Lydia : Well, the doctors looked like total idiots when he turned up alive, but everyone got over it. And yes, Derek taught him the werewolf 101, like how not to randomly kill people during a full moon. 
 Allison : So then you've talked to him? 
 Lydia : Uh, not since he left for London. 
 Allison : You mean since he dad moved him to London. 
 Lydia : Whatever, he left. And seriously, an American werewolf in London? Like, that's not gonna be a disaster. 
 Allison : So you're totally over him? 
 Lydia : Would I be going on a double date if I wasn't? Yes, it is a double date. It's not an orgy. You'll live. 
 Scott : Nah, we agreed to give each other the summer... no texts, no calls. 
 Stiles : So then how do you know she won't be back at school then? 
 Scott : After everything that happened, I'm not sure she's coming back at all. 
 Stiles : I think she is. I'd say pretty definite, you know. Like one hundred percent. 
 Scott : Oh, my God. Oh... 
 Allison : oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't see him, not now. 
 Scott : Can we just drive please, Stiles? 
 Stiles : Scott, it's a red light. 
 Allison : Lydia go! Just go! 
 Lydia : But the light. 
 Stiles : I think we should talk to her, I just think we should say something. 
 Scott : No. No, no, Stiles, come on. Oh, my God, dude, no. 
 Stiles : Hey! You know, they probably didn't see us. 
 Lydia : You all right? 
 Scott : What are you doing? 
 Stiles : I'm driving. 
 Scott : We're right behind them. 
 Stiles : Okay, well, do you see any turns? 
 Scott : I don't want it to look like we're following them. 
 Stiles : Well, what do you want me to do? 
 Scott : I don't know, anything. 
 Allison : Lydia, stop. We need to go back and talk to them. 
 Allison : They stopped too. Why would they stop? 
 Lydia : It's Stiles and Scott. Do you really wanna try applying logic to those two? 
 Allison : Maybe we should go back. 
 Scott : Are you okay? 
 Lydia : It came out of nowhere. 
 Stiles : Are you hurt? 
 Lydia : It ran right into us. 
 Scott : Are you okay? 
 Allison : I'm okay. 
 Lydia : Well, I'm not okay. I am totally freaking out. How the hell does it just run into us? I saw its eyes right before it hit us.n It was like it... it was like it was crazy. 
 Scott : No, it was scared. Actually... Terrified. 
 Melissa : Hey, wait. Wait a minute. I know this one. What happened, Isaac? 
 Isaac : The girl, all right, she's worse, okay? 
 Melissa : Are you not healing? 
 Isaac : I will. Will you just... would you just help her, please? 
 Melissa : Okay, can you take him? 
 Hospital Guy : We gotta move him, Melissa. 
 Melissa : All right, take him. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Braeden : Find him. I have to find him. 
 Melissa : What are you saying? 
 Braeden : I have to... I have to tell him. 
 Melissa : Who? 
 Braeden : The Alpha. Find the Alpha. 
 Melissa : What do you want with Derek Hale? 
 Braeden : No. 
 Melissa : What? 
 Hospital Guy : Okay, let's get her out of here. 
 Braeden : Not Hale. McCall. Scott McCall. 
 Scott : "Ephemeral." Lasting for a short time. "Transient. Momentary." Ephemeral. 
 Chris : You ready? 
 Allison : Yeah. 
 Chris : You know, you could wait till tomorrow if you want. I know the first day can be tough. 
 Allison : I'm all right. 
 Chris : Yeah? 
 Allison : Yeah. 
 Chris : Or you could wait a week, if that would make things easier. 
 Allison : I promised Lydia that I would drive her, since her car's wrecked. So I should... I should go. 
 Stiles : You know how many vehicle collisions last year involved deer? 247,000. 
 Sheriff : Oh, God, please go to school. 
 Stiles : But that's crossing the road. This one last night came right down the middle. 
 Sheriff : I'm not gonna beg you. 
 Stiles : Okay, good. I'm impervious to your influence anyway. 
 Sheriff : Would you consider a bribe? 
 Stiles : You couldn't meet my price. 
 Sheriff : Extortion? 
 Stiles : You got nothing on me. 
 Sheriff : Yeah. 
 Stiles : Dad, what are you doing? Dad, what are you doing? 
 Sheriff : Aah! 
 Random Guy : Looks good on you. So you think we could go on a real date sometime? 
 Lydia : Hm. 
 Random Guy : Uh, can we have s*x again? 
 Lydia : Mm. 
 Stiles : You wanna ask Derek for help? Why, why? 
 Scott : He's got the triskele tattooed on his back. So there has to be a way to do it without healing, right? 
 Stiles : Okay, yeah, but still, doesn't he have his hands a little full? 
 Principal : Look, these are the applications for the career advisor. I need them sorted. And whatever happened to the library while I was gone, I want it cleared up. And what the hell is this? 
 Stiles : Go, go, go. 
 Lydia : Freshmen. Tons and tons of fresh men. 
 Allison : You mean fresh boys. Lydia, they're 14. 
 Lydia : Eh, some are more mature than others. 
 Allison : You know, it's okay to be single. Focus on yourself for a little while, work on becoming a better person. 
 Lydia : Allison, I love you. So if you need to do that thing where we talk about me and pretend like we're not actually talking about you, it's totally fine. But I don't want a boyfriend. I want a distraction. 
 Allison : Brothers? 
 Lydia : Twins. 
 
 
 
 Melissa : Yeah. Yeah, that's healing, visibly. Wow. They can't see this. Nobody can see this. 
 Isaac : All right, cover it up. 
 Melissa : I-I don't think that's gonna matter. I mean, you're scheduled for surgery, which is obviously gonna be very confusing for a lot of people. 
 Isaac : Okay, can you do something? 
 Melissa : Me do something? I'm relatively new to all of this. And there's a sheriff's deputy that's stationed right outside the door. 
 Isaac : Have you tried calling Derek? 
 Melissa : Like, five times. Do you have any other emergency werewolf contacts? 
 Isaac : Yeah. Call Scott. 
 Sheriff : Believe me, sir. I understand. But you have to understand me. Excuse me. Hey, hey, Melissa. 
 Melissa : Hey. 
 Sheriff : C-can you help me out here? 
 Melissa : Yeah. 
 Sheriff : Since the amnesiac in 215 can't tell us anything, I need the girl with the modified military stun gun in 216 to answer a few questions. 
 Melissa : It's kind of unlikely, since she's heavily sedated. 
 Sheriff : Ah, great. Um, well, when she, um... when she un-sedates, will you give me a call? 'Cause she's got about 10 grand worth of property damage to answer for. And I don't want her just walking out of here. 
 Melissa : Okay. 
 Allison : Is someone... no. 
 Scott : No, no, no, no. No, it's all you, all yours. Uh, it's totally vacant. 
 Stiles : "The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds and the tranquil waterway", leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed somber under 
 Jeniffer : "an overcast sky, seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness." This is the last line to the first book we are going to read. It is also the last text you will receive in this class. Phones off, everyone. 
 Melissa : Oh, come on, Scott, come on. Oh, pick up. 
 Kali : Hello, Isaac. 
 Isaac : Hi. 
 Kali : How we feeling? 
 Isaac : Good. Listen, I think I could probably just... what is that? 
 Kali : Just an anesthetic. We don't want you getting in the way again. Count along with me, Isaac. One... two. Three. 
 Jeniffer : Mr. McCall? Uh, I'm sure it's an emergency if your mother needs you to leave school, but I'm gonna give you a warning in the nicest possible way. I am well aware of your attendance record. I don't wanna see you slip back into old habits. 
 Scott : I won't. It's gonna be different this year. 
 Jeniffer : Resolutions are only good if you stick with them, Scott. 
 Scott : I will. I promise it won't be ephemeral. 
 Stiles : Hey, Lydia. What is that? Is that from the accident? 
 Lydia : No. Prada bit me. 
 Stiles : Your dog? 
 Lydia : No, my designer handbag. Yes, my dog. 
 Stiles : Has it ever bitten you before? 
 Lydia : Mm-mm. 
 Stiles : Okay. What if it's, like, the same thing as the deer? You know, like, how animals start acting weird right before an earthquake or something? 
 Lydia : Meaning what? There's gonna be an earthquake? 
 Stiles : Or something. I just... maybe it means something's coming. Something bad. 
 Lydia : It was a deer and a dog. What's that thing you say about threes? Once, twice... 
 Jeniffer : Get down, everyone! Get down, down. Get down! Get down! 
 Scott : Why didn't you tell me before? 
 Melissa : Honestly, I was hoping I didn't have to. 
 Scott : What do you mean? 
 Melissa : Everything that you've been doing... the extra reading, the summer school, saving up for the bike, even though it scares me half to death... honey, I just didn't wanna disrupt a good rhythm. 
 Scott : It's not gonna stop. I-I'm gonna be better this year. A better student, a better son, a better friend, a better everything. I promise. 
 Melissa : Okay. He's in room 215 if he isn't already in surgery. 
 Scott : Thank you. 
 Deucalion : Would you hit the button for the second floor, please? 
 Scott : Yeah. 
 Deucalion : Thank you. 
 Doctor : What the hell is this? Does someone want to explain this to me? 
 Deucalion : You wouldn't mind helping me out for a second, would you? 
 Scott : Um... sure. 
 Doctor : Here's an idea. Why don't you wheel this joker out of here and get somebody that actually needs to be operated on? Now! I'm gonna go smoke. 
 Ennis : Don't you realize what you're dealing with? I'm an Alpha. 
 Derek : So am I. Aren't you supposed to be in school? 
 Stiles : Ms. Blake? You okay? Uh, sorry, just... that. 
 Chris : Next time you're feeling you wanna stay home, you stay home. 
 Allison : I'm okay. But, dad, the deer and now this? 
 Chris : I know, I know. 
 Allison : It can't be a coincidence. 
 Sheriff : Mr. Argent, you wouldn't have any insight into this, would you? 
 Chris : Me? 
 Sheriff : Yeah. All this bizarre animal behavior, it's... you must have seen something like this before, right? 
 Chris : I'm not sure why I would or why you would think I would. 
 Sheriff : I'm sorry. I-I could've sworn I overheard my son talking about how you were an experienced hunter. 
 Chris : Ah, right. Well, not anymore. 
 Sheriff : You all right? 
 Allison : Yeah. 
 Stiles : We got a serious problem at school. Ms. Blake's class...  
 Scott : hey, can you tell me about it later? 
 Stiles : Well, no, pretty sure this qualifies for immediate discussion. 
 Scott : OK then meet me at Derek's 
 Stiles : Derek's house? What the hell are you doing at... 
 Scott : just meet us here, okay? 
 Scott : You don't still live here, do you? 
 Derek : No. The county took it over, but there's something here that I need. It'll help heal a wound from an Alpha. 
 Scott : Yeah, but it did heal. 
 Derek : Not on the inside. 
 Scott : Hey, are you gonna tell me who that was back there? That Alpha. 
 Derek : A rival pack. It's my problem. I know you wanna help, and you did. I owe you one. Now go home. Go back to being a teenager. 
 Scott : Uh, hey, Derek. If you wanna repay back that favor now... There is something you can do for me. 
 Lydia : Is it me or is beacon hills turning into more like beacon for the totally bizarre and supernatural? 
 Braeden : Where's Scott McCall? You're Allison, right? 
 Allison : Yeah, how do you know...  
 Braeden : where's Scott? 
 Allison : He had to leave. He was supposed to be back in class...  
 Braeden : is he coming back? 
 Lydia : Hey, easy with the physicality, sweetheart. Ugh. Well, she bruised me. 
 Allison : Huh. Me too. 
 Chris : Come on, let's get you two girls out of here. School can wait another day. Sweetheart? Hey. You don't have to worry about this anymore. Remember our agreement? We stay in beacon hills, but only if we stay out of this. It's not our problem now. Okay? 
 Sheriff : We've had 15 calls in the past hour. I got a suicidal deer, birds flying through windows, pets behaving aggressively. I gotta tell you, I'm starting to think there's something in the water. 
 Deaton : To be honest, I was gonna give you a call about an incident of my own. At first, I thought I might have had a break-in... some sick individual looking to release a particularly violent impulse. Until I got a closer look and realized what actually happened. They did it to themselves. 
 Derek : Yeah, I see it. It's two bands, right? What does it mean? 
 Scott : I don't know. It's just something I traced with my fingers. 
 Derek : Why is this so important to you? Do you know what the word "tattoo" means? 
 Stiles : To mark something.  
 Scott : Well, that's in tahitian. In samoan, it means "open wound."I knew I wanted to get a tattoo when I turned 18. I always wanted one. I just decided to get it now, to make it kind of a reward. 
 Derek : For what? 
 Scott : For not calling or texting Allison all summer. Even when I really wanted to, even when it was so hard not to sometimes. I was trying to give her the space she wants. Goin' four months later, it still hurts. It still feels like a, uh... 
 Stiles : like an open wound. 
 Scott : Yeah. 
 Derek : The pain's gonna be worse than anything you've ever felt. 
 Stiles : Ah, that's great. 
 Scott : Do it. 
 Stiles : Oh, wow. That's a... that's a lot for me. So I'm gonna take that as my cue. I'm just gonna wait outside. 
 Derek : Nope. You can help hold him down. 
 Stiles : Oh, my God. 
 Derek : Hold him. 
 Scott : Aah! Aah! It worked. 
 Stiles : Well, it looks pretty damn permanent now. 
 Scott : Yeah. I kind of needed something permanent. Everything that's happened to us... everything just changes so fast. Everything's so, uh... Ephemeral. 
 Stiles : Studying for the psats? 
 Scott : Yep. 
 Stiles : Nice. 
 Scott : You painted the door. Why'd you paint the door? 
 Derek : Go home, Scott. 
 Scott : And why only one side? 
 Derek : Scott. 
 Scott : The birds at school and the deer last night... just like the night I got trampled by the deer when I got bit by the Alpha. How many are there? 
 Derek : A pack of 'em. An Alpha pack. 
 Stiles : All of them? How does that even work? 
 Derek : I hear there's some kind of a leader. He's called Deucalion. We know they have Boyd and Erica. 
 Derek : Peter, Isaac, and I have been looking for him for the last four months. 
 Scott : Let's say you find them. How do you deal with an Alpha pack? 
 Derek : With all the help I can get. 
 Isaac : Where is she? Where's the girl? 
 Derek : What girl? 
 Deucalion : Beautiful. But defiant, aren't you? 
 Braeden : Because I know something. I know you're afraid of him. 
 Deucalion : Of a teenage boy? 
 Braeden : Of the man he'll become. 
 Deucalion : I'm aware of a certain potential threat. But then someone once taught me a very smart way to eliminate threat... get someone else to do it for you. 
 Braeden  Derek. 
 Lydia : This one, it's perfect. 
 Allison : Mm, I don't know. I'm still thinking maybe a shade of blue. Lydia, look.
