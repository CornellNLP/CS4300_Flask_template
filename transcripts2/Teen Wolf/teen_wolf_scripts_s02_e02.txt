 2x02 Shape Shifted 
 Isaac : Um - so far it's an "A" in French and a "B" minus in Econ. 
 Mr. Lahey : Oh. What about chemistry? 
 Isaac : I'm not sure. Uh, midterms are in a few days so it could go up. 
 Mr. Lahey : Well, what's it at now? 
 Isaac : The grade? 
 Mr. Lahey : Uh, yeah. 
 Isaac : Uh, I'm not sure. 
 Mr. Lahey : But you just said it could go up. 
 Isaac : I just - uh, I meant generally. 
 Mr. Lahey : You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Isaac? 
 Isaac : No. 
 Mr. Lahey : Then tell me your grade. 
 Isaac : I just told you, I don't know. 
 Mr. Lahey : You wanna take this little conversation downstairs? No? Then tell me the grade, son. 
 Isaac : Dad, this semester's only half over. 
 Mr. Lahey : Isaac? 
 Isaac : There's plenty of time -  
 Mr. Lahey : Isaac. 
 Isaac : It's - it's a "D". 
 Mr. Lahey : All right. It's a "D". I'm not angry. You know I'm gonna have to find a way to punish you though. You know, I have my responsibility as a parent. So we'll start with something simple, like, uh - Tell you what, you do the dishes and you clean up the kitchen, okay? 
 Isaac : Yeah. 
 Mr. Lahey : Good. Because I - I'd really like to see this place spotless. Know what I'm saying? You know? I mean this entire kitchen. Yeah! Yeah, absolutely - Spotless. Well, that was your fault. 
 Isaac : You could have blinded me. 
 Mr. Lahey : Shut up! It's a scratch! It's hardly even - Isaac. Isaac! 
 Jackson : Freaks. 
 Mr. Lahey : Isaac! Isaac! Isaac. Isaac? Isaac? Okay, that's enough. Let's go! That's it, grab your bike and let's go! Isaac? Holy - ! Aah! No! No! No! Aah! No! Aah! No! No! No! No! 
 Allison : Hey. 
 Scott : What are you doing? 
 Allison : Just trying to find you. 
 Scott : Did anyone see you leave? 
 Allison : No. No one, I was careful. What's wrong? Is it the full moon tomorrow night? 
 Scott : No. No, it's not that. Um, I just wanted to ask you some things. About your - um, your family. Actually, your grandfather. 
 Allison : Okay, but I don't really know him. I mean, he's kind of just a guy who sends a check in the mail every year for my birthday. 
 Scott : Does he know about me? About us? 
 Allison : No, my dad hasn't said a thing. What is it? Did something else happen? 
 Scott : We just need to be a lot more careful now. 
 Allison : They're not gonna split us apart. 
 Scott : Not us. Sure no one followed you? 
 Allison : Totally, absolutely, 100 million percent sure. My parents are out, anyways. 
 Scott : Out? 
 Allison : Yeah, it's date night. 
 Principal : Can I help you? 
 Chris : Well, I hope so, Principal Thomas. As a concerned parent, uh, I was wondering - how long has it been since your last performance review? 
 Principal : What? 
 Chris : We were wondering. 
 Victoria : Are you aware there's been an alarming drop in academic achievement and test scores over the past few semesters? 
 Principal : Excuse me? 
 Victoria : It's led the parents of Beacon Hills to the unfortunate conclusion that you may no longer be suited to the position of school principal. 
 Principal : You can't fire me. 
 Victoria : True. But we can torture you. 
 Isaac : Derek? Derek! 
 Derek : What's wrong? 
 Isaac : My dad. I think he's dead. 
 Derek : What did you do? 
 Isaac : That's the thing. It wasn't me. 
 Scott : I'm serious. It's not like the last full moon. I don't feel the same. 
 Stiles : Oh, does that include the urge to maim and kill people like me? 
 Scott : I swear I don't have the urge to maim and kill you. 
 Stiles : You know, you say that now but then the full moon goes up and out come the fangs and the claws and there's a lot of howling and screaming and running everywhere, okay? And it's very stressful on me and so yes, I'm still locking you up. 
 Scott : Okay, fine. But I do think I'm in more control now. Especially since things are good with Allison. 
 Stiles : Okay, I'm aware of how good things are with Allison. 
 Scott : They're really good. 
 Stiles : I - thank you, I know. 
 Scott : I mean, like, really good. 
 Stiles : All right, I get it! Just please shut the hell up before I have the urge to maim and kill myself. 
 Scott : All right, did you get something better than handcuffs this time? 
 Stiles : Yeah, much better. 
 Coach : Part of me wants to ask. The other part says knowing will be more disturbing than anything I could ever imagine. So - I'm gonna walk away. 
 Stiles : That's good. That's a wise choice, coach. 
 Stiles : You okay? Scott. 
 Scott : There's another. In here, right now. 
 Stiles : Another what? 
 Scott : Another werewolf. 
 Allison : You really don't remember anything? 
 Lydia : They called it a fugue state, which is basically a way of saying "We have no idea why you can't remember running through the woods naked for two days." But personally, I don't care. I lost nine pounds. 
 Allison : Are you ready for this? 
 Lydia : Please. It's not like my aunt's a serial killer. 
 Allison : Maybe it's the nine pounds. 
 Scott : It was kind of like a scent, but I couldn't tell who it was. 
 Stiles : What if you can get him one - on - one? Would that help? 
 Scott : Yeah. 
 Stiles : Okay. I think I got an idea. 
 Matt : You need a digital camera? 
 Jackson : Yeah. And something that can record in low light. All night long. 
 Matt : What are you recording? 
 Jackson : Something in low light. All night long. Do you have the camera or not? 
 Matt : You have a hundred bucks? 
 Jackson : I drive a Porsche. What do you think? 
 Matt : I think your parents have a hundred bucks. 
 Jackson : Just get me the camera. 
 Stiles : I told coach you're switching with Danny for the day. 
 Scott : But I hate playing goal. 
 Stiles : Remember when I said I had an idea? This is the idea. 
 Scott : Oh. 
 Stiles : There we go. 
 Scott : What's the idea? 
 Stiles : I seriously don't understand how you survive without me sometimes. 
 Coach : Let's go! Line it up! Faster! Make daddy proud. 
 Scott : Here we go. 
 Scott : Let me help you up. 
 Coach : McCall! 
 Scott : Yeah. 
 Coach : Usually the goalie stays somewhere within the vicinity of the actual goal. 
 Scott : Yes, coach. 
 Coach : Let's try it again. 
 Matt : What the hell, man? 
 Scott : My bad, dude. 
 Coach : McCall! The position's goal keeper. Not goal abandoner. 
 Scott : Sorry, coach. 
 Coach : Let's go! 
 Coach : Stilinski, what the hell is wrong with your friend? 
 Stiles : Uh, he's failing two classes. He's a little socially awkward and if you look close enough, his jaw line's kind of uneven. 
 Coach : That's interesting. Let's fire it up. 
 Danny : It's Armani. 
 Scott : Huh? 
 Danny : My aftershave. Armani. 
 Scott : Oh. It's nice. 
 Coach : McCall! You come out of that goal one more time and you'll be doing suicide runs till you die. It'll be the first ever suicide run that actually ends in a suicide. Got it? 
 Scott : Yes, coach. 
 Coach : Yeah. 
 Jackson : Uh, coach, my shoulder's hurting. I'm gonna - I'm gonna sit this one out. 
 Isaac : Don't tell them. Please don't tell them. 
 Scott : His father's dead. They think he was murdered. 
 Sheriff : Come on. 
 Stiles : Are they saying he's a suspect? 
 Scott : I'm not sure, why? 
 Stiles : Because they can lock him in a holding cell for 24 hours. 
 Scott : Like, overnight? 
 Stiles : During the full moon. 
 Scott : How good are these holding cells at holding people? 
 Stiles : People, good. Werewolves, probably not that good. 
 Scott : Stiles, remember when I said I don't have the urge to maim and kill? 
 Stiles : Yeah. 
 Scott : He does. 
 Scott : Why would Derek choose Isaac? 
 Stiles : Peter told me that if the bite doesn't turn you it could kill you. And maybe teenagers have a better chance of surviving. 
 Scott : Doesn't being a teenager mean your dad can't hold him? 
 Stiles : Well, not unless they have solid evidence. Or a witness. Wait. Danny. Where's Jackson? 
 Danny : In the principal's office talking to your dad. 
 Stiles : What? Why? 
 Danny : Maybe because he lives across the street from Isaac. 
 Scott : Witness. 
 Stiles : We gotta get to the principal's office. 
 Scott : How? 
 Harris : Everyone please turn to page 73. Who in the hell did that? 
 Sheriff : Listen to me, you're telling me that you knew Isaac's father was hitting him? 
 Jackson : Hitting him? He was kicking the crap out of him. 
 Sheriff : Did you ever say anything to anyone? A teacher, parents, anyone? 
 Jackson : Nope. It's not my problem. 
 Sheriff : No, no, of course not. You know, it's funny that the kids getting beaten up are always the ones who least deserve it. 
 Jackson : Yeah. Wait, what? 
 Sheriff : I think we're done here. Hi, Scott. 
 Scott : H - yeah. 
 Gerard : Boys. Come on in. 
 
 
 
 Gerard : Scott McCall. Academically not the most accomplished, but I see you have become quite the star athlete. Mr. Stilinski. Oh, perfect grades but little to no extracurriculars. Maybe you should try lacrosse. 
 Stiles : Oh, actually I'm already -  
 Gerard : Hold on. McCall. You're the Scott that was dating my granddaughter. 
 Scott : We were dating but not anymore. Not dating, not seeing any of each other or doing anything with each other - At all. 
 Gerard : Relax, Scott, you look like you're about to crack a cyanide pill with your teeth. 
 Scott : Just a hard breakup. 
 Gerard : Oh, that's too bad. You seem like a pretty nice kid to me. Now listen, guys. Yes, I am the principal, but I really don't want you to think of me as the enemy. 
 Stiles : Heh, is that so? 
 Gerard : However, this being my first day, I do need to support my teachers. So unfortunately someone is going to have to take the fall and stay behind for detention. 
 Lydia : It's just - we haven't really talked since that night and well - Jackson, can you, like, look at me for half la second? They said if you hadn't found me and carried me back, I could have died. So I just - I wanted to say thank you. 
 Jackson : Lydia, we're not getting back together. 
 Lydia : What? 
 Jackson : And just because I kept you from bleeding out on a field once, don't expect me to come running every time you start screaming. 
 Lydia : I never said -  
 Jackson : I'm not responsible for you. Okay? But I will give you one piece of advice. If I were you, I'd stay home tonight. 
 Lydia : What does that mean? What's tonight? 
 Jackson : It's a full moon. 
 Derek : Get in. 
 Scott : Are you serious? You did that. That's your fault. 
 Derek : I know that. Now get in the car and help me. 
 Scott : No, I've got a better idea. I'm gonna call a lawyer. Because a lawyer might actually have a chance at getting him out before the moon goes up. 
 Derek : Not when they do a real search of the house. 
 Scott : What do you mean? 
 Derek : Whatever Jackson said to the cops, what's in the house is worse. A lot worse. 
 Gerard : I'm not interested in whether they locked up a 16 - year - old kid. I'm interested in what's going to happen to that 16 - year - old when the moon hits its peak tonight. Do we have proof? 
 Chris : Is the next step killing him? 
 Gerard : The next step is eliminating the threat. Do we have proof? 
 Chris : I haven't been in history class for a while, but I'm pretty sure straight - up genocide hasn't worked out too often. 
 Gerard : Do we have proof or not? 
 Chris : Not irrefutable. But not insignificant. The driver's side door of Lahey's car was pried off. 
 Gerard : Pried off? 
 Chris : Ripped off. 
 Matt : I'm starting to feel a little weird about this. 
 Jackson : No, no, no, no. What you're feeling is a hundred dollars richer. Give me the camera and go buy yourself another fancy lens or light meter or whatever gives your photography geeks a hard - on. 
 Matt : This doesn't have anything to do with Allison, does it? I saw you two at the dance the other night and I kind of figured that you two were, you know, together. 
 Jackson : Aw, you have a little thing for Allison, Matt? A little - a little crush? 
 Matt : No. 
 Jackson : You think I'm gonna waste my time by doing something as unbelievably ordinary as making a s*x tape? 
 Matt : Then what are you doing? 
 Jackson : Documenting history. My history. And I want to be able to see it happening. All of it. You'll get it back tomorrow. 
 Scott : If Isaac didn't kill his father, who did? 
 Derek : I don't know yet. 
 Scott : Then how do you know he's telling the truth? 
 Derek : Because I trust my senses. And it's a combination of them. Not just your sense of smell. 
 Scott : You saw the lacrosse thing today. 
 Derek : Yeah. 
 Scott : Did it look that bad? 
 Derek : Yeah. 
 Allison : Sorry. 
 Chris : Allison? 
 Gerard : Come in. We'd like to talk to you. 
 Allison : I'm supposed to study with Lydia, I really don't have time to chat. 
 Chris : Actually, that's who we want to talk to you about, sweetheart. 
 Derek : You wanna learn? Let's start now. 
 Scott : What's down there? 
 Derek : Motive. 
 Scott : And what am I looking for? 
 Derek : Follow your senses. 
 Scott : What happened down here? 
 Derek : The kind of thing that leaves an impression. Open it. 
 Stiles : Hey, sorry, Harris literally just let me out of detention. Literally. And he had my phone the whole frickin' time. 
 Allison : Well, we need to do something right now. They were asking me all these questions about Lydia and how she was bitten by Peter, and then they sent this guy out. 
 Stiles : Wait, what guy? 
 Allison : He was dressed as a Sheriff's deputy. 
 Stiles : They're sending him to the station for Isaac. 
 Allison : He was also carrying this box with something on it, like, um, like a carving or something. 
 Stiles : What was it? 
 Allison : Hold on, hold on. It's in one of these books. I'm taking a picture. Did you get it? 
 Stiles : Yeah, wolfsbane. 
 Allison : What does that mean? 
 Stiles : It means they're gonna kill him. 
 Scott : This is why he said yes to you. 
 Derek : Everyone wants power. 
 Scott : If we help you, then you have to stop. You can't just go around turning people into werewolves. 
 Derek : I can if they're willing. 
 Scott : Did you tell Isaac about the Argents? About being hunted? 
 Derek : Yes, and he still asked. 
 Scott : Then he's an idiot. 
 Derek : And you're the idiot dating Argent's daughter. Yeah. I know your little secret. And if I know, how long do you think it's gonna take for them to find out? You saw what happens to an omega. With me, you learn how to use all of your senses. With me, you learn control. Even on a full moon. 
 Scott : If I'm with you, I lose her. 
 Derek : You're gonna lose her anyway. You know that. 
 Scott : Wait. I'm not part of your pack. But I want him out. He's my responsibility too. 
 Derek : Why? Because he's one of us? 
 Scott : Because he's innocent. 
 Stiles : Hey, did you slow him down? 
 Allison : You could say that. 
 Stiles : All right, well, uh, I'm headed to the station right now. 
 Allison : Where's Scott? 
 Stiles : Isaac's. 
 Allison : Does he have a plan? 
 Stiles : Yeah, but not a very good one. And unfortunately we don't really have time to come up with anything better. 
 Allison : Scott? Are you sure we have to do this? 
 Scott : Yes. 
 Allison : Where? 
 Scott : Please. I don't want to hurt you. 
 Stiles : Okay, now the keys to every cell are in a password protected lockbox in my father's office. The problem is getting past the front desk. 
 Derek : I'll distract her. 
 Stiles : Whoa, whoa, whoa - you? You're not going in there. I'm taking my hand off. 
 Derek : I was exonerated. 
 Stiles : You're still a person of interest. 
 Derek : An innocent person. 
 Stiles : An - you? Yeah, right! Okay, fine. What's your plan? 
 Derek : To distract her. 
 Stiles : Uh - huh. How? By punching her in the face? Unh. 
 Derek : Heh, by talking to her. 
 Stiles : Okay, all right. Give me a sample. What are you gonna open with? Dead silence. That should work beautifully. Any other ideas? 
 Derek : I'm thinking about punching you in the face. 
 Deputy : Good evening, how can I help - you? 
 Derek : Hi. 
 Deputy : Hi. 
 Derek : Um, I had a question. Um, sorry I'm a little - a little thrown. I wasn't really expecting someone -  
 Deputy : Like me? 
 Derek : Oh, I was gonna say "so incredibly beautiful" but, yeah, I guess that'd be the same thing. 
 Allison : It's done. It's locked. 
 Scott : Go. 
 Allison : Scott, I can't -  
 Scott : Just go! 
 Stiles : Oh, no. 
 Stiles : Oh. Uh, just looking, um - Oh, sh -  
 Scott : Allison. Allison! Allison! 
 Stiles : How did you do that? 
 Derek : I'm the Alpha. 
 Allison : Come on. Come on! 
 Allison : What the hell was that? 
 Scott : I don't know. 
 Stiles : Uh, he did it. 
 Mrs. Whittemore : Jackson, what is it? What happened? 
 Jackson : Nothing happened. Nothing at all.
