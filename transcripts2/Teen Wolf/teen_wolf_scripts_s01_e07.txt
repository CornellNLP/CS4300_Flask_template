 1x07 Night School 
 Scott : Lock it, lock it! 
 Stiles : Do I look like I have a key? 
 Scott : Grab something! 
 Stiles : What? 
 Scott : Anything! 
 Scott : No. 
 Stiles : Yes. 
 Scott : Stiles, no, don't. 
 Scott : Run! Stiles! Stiles! 
 Scott : Where is it? Where did it go? That won't hold, will it? 
 Stiles : Probably not. 
 Stiles : The desk. Stop, stop. The door's not gonna keep it out. 
 Scott : I know. 
 Stiles : It's your boss. 
 Scott : What? 
 Stiles : Deaton, the alpha? Your boss. 
 Scott : No. 
 Stiles : Yes, murdering psycho werewolf. 
 Scott : That can't be. 
 Stiles : Oh come on. He disappears, and that thing shows up ten seconds later to toss Derek 20 feet through the air? That's not convenient timing? 
 Scott : It's not him. 
 Stiles : He killed Derek. 
 Scott : No, Derek's not dead. He can't be dead. 
 Stiles : Blood spurted out of his mouth, okay? That doesn't exactly qualify as a minor injury. He's dead, and we're next. 
 Scott : Okay, just - What do we do? 
 Stiles : We get to my jeep, we get out of here, you seriously think about quitting your job, good? 
 Stiles : No, they don't open. The school's climate - controlled. 
 Scott : Then we break it. 
 Stiles : Which will make a lot of noise. 
 Scott : Then, uh, then we run really fast. Really fast. Stiles, what's wrong with the hood of your jeep? 
 Stiles : What do you mean? Nothing's wrong. 
 Scott : It's bent. 
 Stiles : What, like, dented? 
 Scott : No, I mean bent. 
 Stiles : What the hell -  
 Stiles : That's my battery. 
 Scott : Don't. 
 Stiles : We have to move. 
 Scott : He could be right outside. 
 Stiles : He is right outside. 
 Scott : Just let me take a look. 
 Stiles : Nothing? 
 Scott : No. 
 Stiles : Move now? 
 Scott : Move now. 
 Scott : This way. 
 Stiles : No, no, no, no. 
 Scott : What? 
 Stiles : Somewhere without windows. 
 Scott : Every single room in this building has windows. 
 Stiles : Or somewhere with less windows. 
 Scott : The locker room. 
 Stiles : Yeah. 
 Scott : Okay. 
 Scott : Call your dad. 
 Stiles : And tell him what? 
 Scott : I don't know, anything. Gas leak, a fire, whatever. If that thing sees the parking lot filled with cop cars, it'll take off. 
 Stiles : What if it doesn't? What if it goes completely Terminator and kills every cop in sight, including my dad? 
 Scott : They have guns. 
 Stiles : Yeah, and Derek had to be shot with a wolfsbane - laced bullet to even slow him down, you remember that? 
 Scott : Then we - we have to - We have to find a way out and just run for it. 
 Stiles : There's nothing near the school for at least a mile. 
 Scott : What about Derek's car? 
 Stiles : That could work. We go outside, we get the keys off his body, and then we take his car. 
 Scott : And him. 
 Stiles : Fine. Whatever. 
 Stiles : What? 
 Scott : I think I heard something. 
 Stiles : Like what? 
 Scott : Quiet. 
 Scott : Hide. No, no, Stiles. No. 
 Janitor : Son of a bitch! 
 Stiles : Quiet! 
 Janitor : Quiet my ass, what the hell are you trying to do, kill me? Both of you get out. 
 Stiles : Will you just listen for half a second, okay? 
 Janitor : Not okay. Get the hell out of here right Now. 
 Stiles : God, just one second to explain. 
 Janitor : Just shut up and go. 
 Stiles : Go! Go! 
 Jackson : Lydia says we're coming to Get you. 
 Allison : Please don't. Okay, I'm sure he's on his way. He's only - 26 minutes late. 
 Lydia : You hear that? First it's "He's only 26 minutes late," a month later it's "He Only hits me when he's drunk." Slippery slope, Allison. Slippery slope. 
 Jackson : We're picking you up. 
 Allison : No. 
 Jackson : Too late. Lydia gets what Lydia wants. Come on, get in. We can stop by his place and see if he's there. 
 Lydia : Is that him with the best explanation ever of why he's half a freaking hour late? 
 Allison : Not exactly. 
 Stiles : What the hell? 
 Scott : It's a dumpster. 
 Stiles : He pushed it in front of the door to block us in. Come on, help me. 
 Scott : Stop! 
 Stiles : I'm not dying here. I'm not dying at school. 
 Scott : We're not going to die. 
 Stiles : God, what is he doing? What does he want? 
 Scott : Me. Derek says it's stronger with a pack. 
 Stiles : Oh, great. A psychotic werewolf who's into teen work. That's - that's beautiful. 
 Jackson : What're they doing here anyway? 
 Allison : All I got was this. 
 Lydia : They lock the doors at night, you know? 
 Allison : That one's open. 
 Jackson : You don't need me to state the obvious, right? 
 Allison : That it looks like they broke into the school? No, pretty obvious. 
 Jackson : Do you want me to come with you? 
 Allison : It's okay. 
 Jackson : Hey, Allison -  
 Allison : You have this look like you're about to say "Be Careful." 
 Jackson : I am. What? 
 Allison : That concerned look on you, I've never seen it before. 
 Jackson : Well, I am concerned. 
 Allison : Well, that's a good look on you. Don't worry. I'll be right back. 
 Jackson : Okay. 
 Stiles : What? 
 Scott : Go. 
 Stiles : All right, we have to do something. 
 Scott : Like what? 
 Stiles : I don't know. Kill it, hurt it, inflict mental anguish on it. Something. 
 Scott : What are you doing? 
 Stiles : The desk. Come on, the desk. 
 Scott : He can't -  
 Stiles : All right. 
 Jackson : Do you see that? 
 Lydia : See what? 
 Jackson : The hood on that piece of crap jeep looks crappier than usual. 
 Lydia : Where are you going? 
 Jackson : To take a look, stay here. 
 Lydia : I'm not staying in the car. 
 Jackson : Just stay in the damn -  
 Lydia : Do not leave me alone in the car. 
 Jackson : Fine. God, don't have a meltdown. 
 Lydia : Look at that. It is indeed a piece of crap. Can we get Allison and leave now? What are you doing? Are you getting Allison? Jackson! 
 Stiles : Come on, get across. Come on! 
 Scott : What? 
 Scott : What are you doing? 
 Stiles : I just wanna get a look at It. 
 Scott : Are you crazy? 
 Stiles : Look, it's trapped, okay? It's not gonna get out. Yeah, that's right, we got you -  
 Scott : Will you shut up! 
 Stiles : I'm not scared of this thing. I'm not scared of you. Right, 'cause you're in there, and we're out here. You're not going any -  
 Allison : Scott? Scott? Scott? Scott? Scott? 
 
 
 
 Lydia : There's one right here. 
 Jackson : Are you kidding me? You have to use the bathroom now? 
 Lydia : Yes now. You have a problem with my performing a basic biological function? 
 Jackson : You know, I'm starting to have a problem with all of your functions. 
 Jackson : McCall. Scott? Derek? 
 Lydia : Did you find them? 
 Jackson : No, no. 
 Scott : Wait. Do you hear that? 
 Stiles : Hear what? 
 Scott : It sounds like a phone ringing. 
 Stiles : What? 
 Scott : I know that ring. It's Allison's phone. 
 Allison : Hey. I can't seem to find them. Okay, give me a second and I'll be right there. Stiles? 
 Scott : No, it's me, where are you? 
 Allison : I'm in the school looking for you, why weren't you at my place? 
 Scott : Where are you right now? 
 Allison : On the first floor. 
 Scot : Where? Where are you exactly? 
 Allison : The swimming pools. 
 Scott : Get to the lobby. Go now. 
 Allison : Okay, okay, I'm coming. 
 Scott : Why did you come? What are you doing here? 
 Allison : Because you asked me to. 
 Scott : I asked you to? 
 Allison : Why do I get the feeling you didn't send this message? 
 Scott : Because I didn't. 
 Stiles : Did you drive here? 
 Allison : Jackson, did. 
 Scott : Jackson's here too? 
 Allison : And Lydia, what's going on? Who sent this text? Where are you? 
 Lydia : Finally. Can we go now? 
 Scott : Run! 
 Scott : Help me get this in front of the door. 
 Stiles : Scott, wait, not here. 
 Allison : What was that? Scott, what was that? 
 Lydia : What came out of the ceiling? 
 Scott : Will you just help me? The chairs, stack the chairs. 
 Stiles : Guys - Can we just wait a second? You guys, listen to me, w - Can we wait a second? Guys? Stiles talking. Can we hang on one second, please? Hello! Okay, nice work. Really beautiful job, everyone. Now - what should we do about the 20 foot wall of windows? 
 Allison : Can somebody please explain to me what's going on, because I'm freaking out here. And I would like to know why. Scott? 
 Stiles : Somebody killed the janitor. 
 Lydia : What? 
 Stiles : Yeah, the janitor's dead. 
 Allison : What's he talking about? Is this a joke? 
 Jackson : What, who killed him? 
 Lydia : No, no, no, no. This was supposed to be over. The mountain lion killed -  
 Jackson : No, don't you get it? There wasn't a mountain lion. 
 Allison : Who was it? What does he want? What's happening? Scott! 
 Scott : I - I don't know. I - I just - If - if we go out there, he's gonna kill us. 
 Lydia : Us? He's gonna kill us? 
 Allison : Who? Who is it? 
 Scott : It's Derek. It's Derek Hale. 
 Jackson : Derek killed the janitor? 
 Allison : Are you sure? 
 Scott : I saw him. 
 Lydia : The mountain li -  
 Scott : No, Derek killed them. 
 Allison : All of them? 
 Scott : Yeah, starting with his own sister. 
 Allison : The bus driver? 
 Scott : And the guy in the video store - it's been Derek the whole time. He's in here with us. And if we don't get out now - He's going to kill us too. 
 Jackson : Call the cops. 
 Stiles : No 
 Jackson : Wh - what do you mean "No?" 
 Stiles : I mean no. You wanna hear it in spanish? No. Look, Derek killed three people, okay? We don't know what he's armed with. 
 Jackson : Your dad is armed with an entire sheriff's department. Call him. 
 Lydia : I'm calling. 
 Stiles : No, Lydia, would you just hold on a sec -  
 Scott : Hey. 
 Lydia : Yes, we're at Beacon Hills high school. We're trapped, and we need you to - but - She hung up on me. 
 Allison : The police hung up on you? 
 Lydia : She said they got a tip warning them that there are gonna be prank calls about a break - in at the high school. She said if I called again that they're gonna trace it and have me arrested. 
 Allison : Okay, then call again. 
 Stiles : No, they won't trace a cell and they'll send a car to your house before they send anyone here. 
 Allison : What the—what - what is this? Why does Derek wanna kill us? Why is he killing anyone? 
 Scott : Why's everyone looking at me? 
 Lydia : Is he the one that sent her the text? 
 Scott : No. I mean, I don't know. 
 Allison : Is he the one that called the police? 
 Scott : I don't know! 
 Stiles : All right, why don't we ease back on the throttle here, yeah? 
 Stiles : Okay, first off, throwing Derek under the bus, nicely done. 
 Scott : I didn't know what to say. I had to say something. And if he's dead then it doesn't matter, right? Except if he's not. Oh, god, I totally just bit her head off. 
 Stiles : And she'll totally get over it. Bigger issues at hand here, like how do we get out alive? 
 Scott : But we are alive. It could've killed us already. It's like it's cornering us or something. 
 Stiles : So what, he wants to eat us all at the same time? 
 Scott : No! Derek said it wants revenge. 
 Stiles : Against who? 
 Scott : Allison's family? 
 Stiles : Maybe that's what the text was about. Someone had to send it. 
 Jackson : Okay, assheads - new plan. Stiles calls his useless dad and tells him to send someone with a gun and decent aim. Are we good with that? 
 Scott : He's right. Tell him the truth if you have to, just - just call him. 
 Stiles : I'm not watching my dad get eaten alive. 
 Jackson : All right, give me the phone. 
 Allison : Jackson! Are you okay? Hey, are you okay? 
 Stiles : Dad, hey, it's me. And it's your voice mail. Look, I need you to call me back now. Like, right now. We're at the school. Dad, we're at the school. 
 Lydia : Oh my god. 
 Stiles : The kitchen, the door out of the kitchen leads to the stairwell. 
 Scott : Which only goes up. 
 Stiles : Up is better than here. 
 Scott : Jackson, how many people can fit in your car? 
 Jackson : Five, if someone squeezes on someone's lap. 
 Allison : Five? I barely fit in the back. 
 Stiles : It doesn't matter. There's no getting out without drawing attention. 
 Scott : What about this? This leads to the roof. We can go down the fire escape to the parking lot in, like, seconds. 
 Stiles : That's a deadbolt. 
 Scott : The janitor has a key. 
 Stiles : You mean his body has it. 
 Scott : I can get it. I can find him by scent, by blood. 
 Stiles : Well, gee, that sounds like an incredibly terrible idea. What else you got? 
 Scott : I'm getting the key. 
 Allison : Are you serious? 
 Scott : Well, it's the best plan. Someone has to get the key if we wanna get out of here. 
 Allison : You can't go out there unarmed. 
 Scott : Well, it's better than nothing. 
 Stiles : There's gotta be something else. 
 Lydia : There is. 
 Stiles : What are we gonna do? Throw acid on him? 
 Lydia : No. Like a fire bomb. In there is everything you need to make a self - igniting molotov cocktail. 
 Stiles : Self - igniting -  
 Lydia : - molotov cocktail. What? I read it somewhere. 
 Stiles : We don't have a key for that either. 
 Lydia : Jackson, hand me the sulfuric acid. 
 Allison : No. No, this is insane, you can't do this. You cannot go out there. 
 Scott : We can't just sit here waiting for Stiles' dad to check his messages. 
 Allison : You could die. Don't you get that? He's killed three people. 
 Scott : And we're next. Somebody has to do something. 
 Allison : Scott, just stop. Do you remember - do you remember when you told me you knew whether or lying? That I had a tell. Well, so do you. You're a horrible liar. And you've been lying all night. Just - just please - please don't go. Please don't leave us. Please. 
 Scott : Lock it behind me. 
 Allison : I don't get this. I don't get why he's out there, and why he left us. And I can't - I can't stop my hands from shaking. 
 Jackson : It's okay. It's okay, it's gonna be okay. 
 Allison : Okay. 
 Lydia : Jackson, you handed me the sulfuric acid, right? It has to be sulfuric acid. It won't ignite if it's not. 
 Jackson : I gave you exactly what you asked for tonight. 
 Lydia : Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure you did. 
 Scott : Come on. Come get me. Damn it. 
 Jackson : No, I'm fine. Like, seriously, I'm okay. 
 Allison : That didn't sound okay at all. 
 Stiles : What's on the back of your neck? 
 Jackson : I said I'm fine. 
 Lydia : It's been there for days. He won't tell me what happened. 
 Jackson : As if you actually care. 
 Stiles : All right, can we not argue for half a second here? 
 Allison : Where's Scott? He should be back by now. 
 Allison : Scott! Scott! 
 Lydia : Where's he going? 
 Allison : Scott. Scott. Scott! Scott! 
 Lydia : Stop. Stop! Do you hear that? Listen! 
 Sheriff : You sure it was Derek Hale? 
 Scott : Yes. 
 Stiles : I saw him too. 
 Scott : What about the janitor? 
 Sheriff : We're still looking. 
 Scott : Did you check under the bleachers? Under them? 
 Sheriff : Yeah, Scott, we looked. We pulled them out just like you asked, there's nothing. 
 Scott : I'm not making this up. 
 Sheriff : I know, I believe you, I do. 
 Scott : No, you don't. You have this look like you feel bad for me. Like you wanna believe me, but I know you don't. 
 Sheriff : Listen - We're gonna search this whole school. We're gonna find him. Okay? I promise. 
 Deputy : Sheriff! 
 Sheriff : Stay. Both of you. 
 Stiles : Well, we survived, dude. You know? We outlasted the alpha. It's still good, right? Being alive? 
 Scott : When we were in the chemistry room, he walked right by us. You don't think that it heard us? You don't think it knew exactly where we were? 
 Stiles : Well, then how come we're still alive? 
 Scott : It wants me in its pack. But I think, first - I have to get rid of my old pack. 
 Stiles : What do you mean? What old pack? 
 Scott : Allison. Jackson, Lydia. You. 
 Stiles : The alpha doesn't wanna kill us. 
 Scott : It wants me to do it. And that's not even the worst part. 
 Stiles : How in holy hell is that not the worst part, Scott? 
 Scott : Because when he made me shift - I wanted to do it. I wanted to kill you. All of you. 
 Deaton : There you are. 
 Scott : How - ? How did you -  
 Deaton : Get out? Not easily. And from what they tell me, I'm alive because of you. I think I owe you a raise. 
 Sheriff : Guys, come on, let's let the EMT's do their job. You can talk to him later. 
 Scott : Allison! Are you okay? 
 Allison : My dad's on his way. 
 Scott : You need, uh, you need anything from me? Want me to go with you? 
 Allison : No. I don't. 
 Scott : Okay. 
 Allison : And I also don't know what happened to you in there. I don't know what you were thinking. Maybe you weren't, but - Right now, I don't - I don't feel like I can trust you. 
 Scott : Allison, I can explain. 
 Allison : I don't care. 
 Scott : Okay, don't say anything else, please, just don't say -  
 Allison : Scott, I ca -  
 Scott : Allison, just stop. Please, just don't say anything. Stiles' dad is gonna give me a ride home. I need to make sure my mom isn't freaking out. I'm gonna get a new phone tomorrow morning, and - I'm gonna get a new phone, and I'm gonna give you a call -  
 Allison : Don't. 
 Scott : What? 
 Allison : Don't call. Just - Just please don't call me
