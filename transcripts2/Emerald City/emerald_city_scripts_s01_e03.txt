 Previously on "Emerald City"... 
 [dramatic music] Help me. What happened to you? I don't remember. Where does the road lead? To the Wizard of Oz. And he can probably take me home. Find out who or what fell from the sky. And make sure it doesn't come back to Emerald City. The Witch of the East is dead. Squeeze the trigger. [gunshot] A hole carved neatly out of our sister's head. I found our sister's killer. We are the last cardinal witches, you and I. ♪ ♪ How is he? Please, my friend needs help. Who's up there? It's a boy. Who you keep locked up. Come on, we're getting you out of here. I need my medicine. ♪ ♪ You have no idea what you've done! ♪ ♪ Stop it, Lucas! Stop! You all right? I need that medicine. Tip... It's me, Jack. Something's happened. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [gunshot] ♪ ♪ Lucas? [dog whines] [dog barks] Lucas! [dog continues to bark] ♪ ♪ [dog whining] You shouldn't have that. I don't think anyone should. Give it to me. What's it called? A gun. When you kill someone with a sword, at least you got to work at it. Some of us. That woman was going to kill you, so I acted on instinct. And that's what scares me. Well, maybe it should. Look, whatever's inside me... I'll discover it soon enough and so will you. When all is laid bare, I'm just one man with a sword. I'm sure there are thousands like me, no one of us more dangerous than the next. But none of us are as terrifying... as you with this. Here. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [animal roars] ♪ ♪ [lion roars] ♪ ♪ [lion snarls] ♪ ♪ [wind whistling] What is that? That's the Witch of East's keep. The Mistress of the Eastern Wood, Most Merciful and Stern, is dead. She controlled the weather. Now it mourns for her. How'd she die? Murdered. [men calling out] [horses neighing] ♪ ♪ Tip? Have you made your mind up? Tip. Have you decided what you want to do? You mean about waking up a girl? I don't know. Is there something I can do? If there is, then please tell me. Do you want to turn around and go home? 'Cause we will. No. Then we go to Ev. We find more medicine. Whatever happened, we'll fix it. We'll turn you back to you. Why have we stopped? ♪ ♪ Wizard's Guard blocking the road. ♪ ♪ What would you have me do? Not butcher anyone. What if it's me they're looking for? Lucas, they think you're dead. We should go. Before they realize I'm not. Come on. No. The Wizard's Guards can take me to Emerald City. I... I guess this is where we say good-bye, then. ♪ ♪ Then I guess it is. Bye. ♪ ♪ They're in the back. In the last car. ♪ ♪ [dog whimpers] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Toto, I know what you're thinking. Don't do it. ♪ ♪ Toto! [lion snarls] Toto? ♪ ♪ [muffled cry] ♪ ♪ Shh! What're you doing? ♪ ♪ [heavy footsteps in car] Find the girl. She must die. Now! Why does he want me dead? Because the Wizard wants you dead. ♪ ♪ How did they get up there? I'm told they climbed. 200 feet? Without ropes? Without anyone seeing them? Your people are assuming they flew. [background chatter] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Are they witches? No. They're possessed by magic. What're they doing now? Speak! It's a ritual. For what? [crowd exclaims] Suicide. [crowd screams] [cracking sound] [crowd screaming] ♪ ♪ [crowd exclaims] ♪ ♪ What did I ever do to this Wizard? Why would he want to kill me? Well, maybe you're more dangerous than I am. I really hope that when we figure out who you are, you're one of those guys that says "Oh, don't worry about it, everything's gonna be okay," all the time. Don't worry about it, everything's gonna be okay. Once we figure out where we're going. [breathing hard] I already have. [thunder rumbling] The Witch of the East's castle? A-are you... are you mad? Well, we can't go to Emerald City. The Wizard's not gonna help you get your memory back. He's not gonna help me get home. He's not gonna help, period. So... I need to find another way. Sorry, to do what? To get yourself killed? I came here in a tornado. Maybe I can leave in one. ♪ ♪ The return of The Beast Forever weighs on everyone's mind. The tear in the sky, the death of Mistress East... We've been flooded with signs and portends that require our analysis if we are to determine when it will arrive and what form it will take before it lays waste to all of us. What about these portends who committed magical suicide in front of me and half the city? Who are they? We are, as always, separating wheat from chaff. These women are not chaff! If I may? Field patterns of a remote region in the West. They bear similarity to these engravings made before The Beast appeared in 1378. What form did it take back then? Fire. How long did it take to come? When the two moons became one. Well, that's in... Eight days. Yes. Until The Beast incinerates us all. If I may? Um... Since I am new and lacking in wisdom and therefore useless to your aid, can I be spared to help The Wizard? I mean no disrespect, but the field pattern is not a sign of The Beast Forever. Elizabeth is wrong. The death of Mistress East leaves the weather in chaos. That field is heavy with dew-frost. It's going to snow tonight. That's all it means. [laughs] You're here for a few days, you're contradicting my most talented councilwoman. Second most talented. And there's no need for an autopsy to determine where these women came from. ♪ ♪ Mistress West. The Wizard of Oz has demanded an audience with you. [scoffs] When I was 12... my mom sat me down. She told me she wasn't my mom. That my dad wasn't my dad. My real mom's name was Karen Chapman. My whole life, I imagined what it would be like, and... the moment I did finally meet her, I was taken here. Dorothy. You can't just control a tornado. It's not a dog. And you're not the Witch of the East. Yeah, I know. W-what if it kills you? Lucas, I'd rather die trying than never get a chance to see her again. Come to loot? Come to steal? No. We... we come for shelter. To loot. To steal. No, we... we wouldn't do that. Your lives I must take in my Mistress' stead. Faith and fealty to the end. No, please! [shimmering tones] [mysterious music] Dorothy... ♪ ♪ You wear the elements. My Mistress' gauntlets. Yes. Yes, I do. Are you my new Mistress? ♪ ♪ Yes, I am. ♪ ♪ [shimmering tones] I am your new Mistress. [wind howling] [windmill clattering] Tip, we're here. That's what Ev looks like. Come on. What you waiting for? [sweeping music] ♪ ♪ [background chatter] Move it, boy! ♪ ♪ What? You don't like it? I don't know. You've eaten the same food your whole life. It's gonna be different. Everything is. Everything  is. I just want to get the medicine and get back to normal. I feel like I'm wearing someone else's skin. I'll ask around. I'm sure there's a herbalist nearby. You want to do it before you grow old? Yeah, yeah. Unless you're planning on making money off them, you might want to stop advertising. Oh, no. No, no. [sniffles] Name's Sullivan. Keeper-of-the-house. This one cleaned the chambers. Stoked a fire. But running off like he did is a blood crime, Mistress-New-Mistress. Running off is a blood crime. Understand? [ominous music] Mistress never spoke of you. But I heard whispers of an acolyte. She felt it was best to keep my secret. Did Mistress pass peacefully? Were you there? I-I-I wasn't... but I was told she passed very peacefully. That lifts my heart to hear, Mistress-New-Mistress. How 'bout just Mistress? Your command. ♪ ♪ Sullivan? The cyclone above the castle... take me to it. Oh, yes, the weather must be settled, or it'll devour this castle whole. [tornado whirring] That is why you've come, to settle the weather. You have been trained, yes? [wind howling] The elements are yours, proper? ♪ ♪ Yes, they're mine. Proper. Good. But first, you must be purified. [tornado rumbling] [wind howling] When you are finished with the rituals of purification, you will dress for the Ceremony of Elements... and settle the weather. ♪ ♪ You will find everything to your liking, my Mistress. Servants' quarters, down the hall. They're empty. ♪ ♪ Swordsman must surrender his sword. ♪ ♪ I am the Mistress' blade now. ♪ ♪ Lucas. Lucas... Just give him your sword. [dark music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Listen to me very carefully. If you can't do what he's asking, he's gonna kill you. And now I can't stop him. I don't need you to. All I need is for that tornado to take me as far away from here as possible. Dorothy, I may have lost every thought, every memory I ever had, but I do know this: reckless... it's not the same as brave. I'm going home. Dorothy! Three dead girls... your girls... hanging in the square! Tragic, I know. I'll need to find replacements. If you're looking for a career change... Magic! That I banned from Oz. Here in Emerald City! Should I awake my giants to make an example of you? You think I had something to do with this? I'll have my councilwomen determine whether you're guilty or innocent. [chuckles] Sure picked the right one for the job. You don't know. Whee hee hee! How amusing. Know what? Your mother worked here. Before you were born. And after. But she wanted a better life for you, so she gave you up, sent you far, far away. Only to have you return. [laughs] I bet under that robe, you're just as succulent as she was. She was succulent. Tasted her, myself. So did he. Don't worry, she's not yours. You can taste her, too. ♪ ♪ [lightly suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [wind moaning] Wanna get purified? [whines] Yeah, me neither. ♪ ♪ [wind howling] Right. So what says "settle the weather, or get killed by a psycho"? [uplifting music] ♪ ♪ Um, you look... Like Mistress of the Eastern Wood. Most Merciful and Stern. Yeah, can we just settle this weather? [thunder crashes] [wind rushing] [thunder crashes] [wind howling] [thunder crashes] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [thunder crashes] [dramatic music] Surely old-Mistress showed you the lake! And the Sharpness. Do you think I'm supposed to swim the lake? I... ♪ ♪ [creature screeches] I'm guessing that's the Sharpness. Why do you not use the elements? Ritual of elements. Ritual of elements. [thunder crashes] ♪ ♪ [shimmering tones] [epic music] ♪ ♪ [thunder crashes] ♪ ♪ [whoosh] [wind whistles] Dorothy? My name is Frank Morgan. You think my mother christened me the Wizard of Oz? [chuckles] I was a man before I was a wizard. You harness lightning and control Giants. Anna... Before I came to Emerald City, I had no such power. Not for lack of trying. I studied hard. And I worked harder. I-I-I desperately wanted to be noticed. I just... I wasn't noticeable. Not like you. Why are you telling me this? Because that was my past. Because I took my past and I obliterated it. People called me the Wizard of Oz because I demanded it. Crushed anyone who denied me the name. Your past does not define you. Your mother does not define you. All that matters... is who you wish to be. And how hard you're willing to fight for it. ♪ ♪ What did she look like? My mother? ♪ ♪ I don't remember. Good. ♪ ♪ Can I help you find something? Uh, yes. I need more of this. Well, do you know what it is? I've got bad blood. "Bad blood"? That's what my guardian said. She made it. So... where is this guardian of yours? Died of old age. Almost 100 years old. How she would have loved to see the day. Hmm. But without her, my friend has no more medicine. Mm, some of these country remedies are impossible to figure. I'll give it a try. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic musical sting] ♪ ♪ [mouthing] Mom. ♪ ♪ Do all the girls take poppies? Most of take them every once in a while. Just for fun. And those women who jumped, what can you tell me about them? They were just like the rest. Except they wake the old men. Men who couldn't... "raise the flag," if you get me meaning. I believe I do. I confess. I didn't do it. That's for Anna to decide. However, your punishment will be my decision. I am a Cardinal Witch. The last of our kind. I have powers you can't even fathom. And I own a run-down brothel. Because I hate magic even more than you. Do you? I'm glad you banned it. I'm glad not to use it. Magic was a drug even worse than the poppy. Lot of good it did us against The Beast Forever. All those powerful witches. And their powerful spells. [water splashes] Drowned by The Beast. And me... useless to stop it. Where's the magic in that? Come this way, please. I can't make you your medicine, love. Which is to say, I won't. No one will, not anywhere, and you shouldn't ever ask again. Why? Because you could hang for it. It's a black elixir, it's magic. It disturbs your true nature. My true nature? What you are right now, what's under those clothes, that's not a side effect of the medicine wearing off. That's what happens when the medicine itself wears off. But I'm a boy. I've always been a boy. Yes, someone may have wanted that, and they gave you this to make it so. But it's not how you were born. This is how you were born. [emotional music] ♪ ♪ If I may? Just tell me Elizabeth was wrong. She was. But not about the timing. The Beast Forever will come when the two moons become one. And then what? The Beast that comes will not take the form of fire. It will be far, far worse. Those girls who leapt to their deaths, their magic did not come from Mistress West. It came from The Beast itself. This is a Beast who knows you. Knows me? Exploits your greatest fears, reveals your greatest weakness. I have no weakness. Except that you've lost control of your Giants. Haven't you? The Beast chose those women because of the men they served. Men who were impotent. Just like the Eternal Warrior, The Beast knows everything. Well, you also thought that it would snow during sun season. Snow. Will that be all, Anna? I don't think you ever controlled the Giants. I think their power is locked inside the Prison of the Abject. And that is why you want it opened. I'm saying this for your benefit and for the benefit of Oz. I will tell no one. Not even Clinda. ♪ ♪ [slam] [lock clanks] [wind whistling] Dorothy! Mistress! The weather! You didn't settle the weather! I can't! Of course you can. You have the elements. You walked the Lake and the Sharpness. Where did you go? How did this get here? You went to the wrong place. You picked the wrong object, Mistress. The remnants will not settle the weather. Those objects belong to Interlopers who never belonged in Oz. No, I-I... I know this person. That's not possible. That belongs to the Interloper. The Wizard of Oz brought Interloper here, himself. To send her back. How could you have seen this person? [wind howling] [crackling, rattling] She's my mother. Then you are no Mistress. You are Interloper, too. No! No! Stop! Or swordsman dies. No. Is this what you did to my Mistress? No! Lie... loot and steal. No! Tell me, or swordsman dies! She killed herself! I lied. It wasn't peaceful. [thudding] No. No, it wasn't. That's why I have the gauntlets. There is no acolyte, the weather will not be settled. It's over! I'm really sorry, just please don't hurt him. [thudding, rumbling] Let's go. Come on! Toto! Toto? [pieces clattering] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [boom] [grunts] [both panting] You were right. About what? I am far more dangerous than you are. My mother was in Oz, Lucas. My mom was in Oz. We'll find you answers. No. My answers were here, and now they're gone because of me. The Wizard brought your mother here. He'll have your answers. The Wizard wants me dead. Well, how much are those answers worth? Huh? [whimsical music] ♪ ♪ Where are you going? Dorothy. To see The Wizard. [dramatic music] [dog barks] Please, sir. This is of the utmost importance. You must listen to me. There is no doubt that The Beast Forever will reveal itself as a hailstorm of fire. It will blaze through Oz until it has obliterated that which fell from the sky and everything else that stands in its path. And only your Eternal Warriors can stop it. An army of stone which fire cannot consume. [soft music] ♪ ♪ On behalf of the High Council, we advise you to animate your Stone Giants immediately. Before we all burn. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Tip! ♪ ♪ Tip! ♪ ♪ Tip. Why did you run off like that? I've been looking everywhere for you. It's a joke. Everything. My whole life. Me. Everything. What do you mean? This is me. This. These. Her. I've always been this. I was born this. No, that's... crazy. Why would Mombi... Why does anyone do anything? You're still Tip! Really? Am I Tip? Because Tip thought if he ran away, if he just got clear of that place, then maybe he could find a life. We can still do that. You  can. It's gonna be okay. Stop doing that. It's not okay, it's not gonna be okay! Someone took me, someone stole me, and the worst part is, I'm still here! [emotional music] ♪ ♪ No. No, no, no... I stole it for us. We can sell the emeralds. We can stay together, no matter what. ♪ ♪ What are you doing? I don't know why I did that. You can't do that! I'm trying... You of all people! I'm sorry! This isn't me! [dramatic music] [thud] ♪ ♪
