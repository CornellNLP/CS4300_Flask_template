 Previously on "Emerald City"... 
 Come on. We're getting you out of here. 
 We? 
 Us. 
 Jack. 
 What have you done to me? 
 Saved your life, of course. 
 [screaming] 
 This is Lady Ev. 
 The Princess owns you. 
 You ready to work? 
 I don't want to forget. 
 Well, what do you want? 
 Your magic. 
 Beast Forever have a brain and a heart. 
 If it has a heart, you can kill it.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Sylvie? 
 No! 
 Roan? 
 Stay back, all of you. 
 Roan! 
 Stay back. 
 Roan! 
 Stop. 
 Dorothy, that man, he knew me. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [ominous music] [panting] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ So... Are you a good witch... or a bad witch? [bombastic music] [cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Oh, I must say, The Wizard has outdone himself. Because he wants something from you. Oh, well. Cynical girl. Cynicism is just an unpleasant way of telling the truth. [mumbles] [hums] Who are you? Jack. We met at the palace. And how do you know my Langwidere? Well, I'm her... Property. He's indentured to me for the cost of his metal. Oh! [laughs] Oh, how sweet. [carriage rustling] You know, you really ought to keep your hands to yourself. [door creaks] Father. [giggles] [groans] Are you all right? Yes, my love. Yes. [sighs] [door creaks] I brought an old friend with me... Ro. It's okay, Indra. Get the girl some food. Of course, Father. ♪ ♪ It's okay. We'll find Dorothy soon, I promise. Hi. Come. Sit down. ♪ ♪ Why are you helping me? Roan, you... I don't know who Roan is. It's you. A soldier? My soldier. The best I've ever known. But you don't remember that, do you? All I know is, I was found in Nimbo, left for dead by your men. There was an insurgency. Witchcraft. A lot of my soldiers were killed. Could I be responsible? Then I'd be a traitor. You didn't kill those men. Well, how can you be so sure? Because I know you. I know the man you are. And I'll prove it. I'll clear your name. [groans] Let me come with you. You have to stay here. Do not leave the house. If those men find you, they will finish the job for sure. Eamonn! Eamonn! Oh, I need to get you help. Stay here. That is an order. Help! ♪ ♪ Not much for conversation, is she? This is the woman who killed your sister. I trust you will be fair. Fair with you. Yes. Not so much with her. You said you would free my wife. Nahara. From the Prison of the Abject. Can your magic do that? My magic... can do a great many things. Come back tomorrow and your wife will be waiting. [speaks Munja'kin] Mistress. [speaks Munja'kin] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Tea! ♪ ♪ Where were we? ♪ ♪ Good witch... or bad witch? There's no wrong answer. Unfortunately, there's no right one, either. ♪ ♪ You're wrong about all of this. I didn't kill your sister. Liar! [glass shatters] I will suck the lies out of you like marrow from a bone, or you can speak the truth now and save yourself the hurt. By what magic did you kill my sister? My bag. Look in my bag. ♪ ♪ That. What kind of magic is this? Magic strong enough to kill a witch. Huh. So this is how you killed her. [whimpers] Please. It was here. Please. Right here. Please. Please. This may come as a surprise, but I'm not easily loved. Please. And you murdered the only person who was able to. [gun clicks] Lying to me... was a very bad idea! [blow landing] [glass clinking] I would like to propose a toast. To my dear friend, August, the King of Ev. Welcome to the Festival of the Beast. Where masks symbolize unknown terror. And we celebrate the day that I vanquished that terror from our land. But when the two moons become one, The Beast Forever will return, and it will be worse than ever before. And it will obliterate everything in its wake. But if you build us weapons, with our expert knowledge, your technological prowess... [glass shattering] [laughs] We can... we will defeat it. You say you have "expert knowledge." Tell me, what expert knowledge would this be? Anna? We know that this beast will come from the sky. Where not even the giants can reach. It will have a heart and it will think, and it will feel, and because of that, it can be killed. You disagree? We both read the signs differently. But one reading must be right, and the other must be wrong. Are you the dumb one, then? Langwidere... So she's the dumb one? Child, show some respect. I believe Anna has misread... Elizabeth! No, my signs are clear. My dear Wizard... it seems you have an abundance of expert council. The only problem is, they don't seem to agree. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [low muttering] [gasps] ♪ ♪ What do you want? I found our sister's killer. Where is she? Napping. We had a strenuous conversation. Don't do anything until I arrive. I'll do with her as I please. And make a mess of it, no doubt. Wait for me. ♪ ♪ Tea! You don't have to yell, my ears haven't changed. Were you this insolent as a boy? Why don't you turn me back into one and find out? Everybody wants to be something they're not. Stop thinking you're so special! What? Did I hurt your feelings? Only the people you love can make you angry. So angry, you want to strangle them. Push them off a building. The ones you don't hate, sometimes you don't really love, either. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Mistress? Miranda, go downstairs and see if the prisoner's awake and take the chamber pot on your way out. ♪ ♪ No, don't mind her. Who is she? The old you. ♪ ♪ [door opens] ♪ ♪ [water rushing] ♪ ♪ Is there a river down there? Sewer. ♪ ♪ Were you thinking about a swim? ♪ ♪ [screams] [gasps] Hey. It's me. Sorry. Remind me to teach you the proper way to wake someone up. Lu-cas? Right, it's, uh... it's a name that Dorothy calls me. Dorothy here. Here? Are you sure? How... how do you know? ♪ ♪ [ominous music] Comfortable? ♪ ♪ Maybe you need a good stretch? ♪ ♪ [panting] ♪ ♪ [snaps fingers] Look at me. Glinda will be coming here tomorrow and expects information from you. But you're going to give it to me first. When you killed my sister... I told you, I didn't. [groans] She was on her way to see me. What was she coming to share? I don't know. Were you acting as someone's agent when you murdered her? No! On orders? To keep her from telling me her secrets? No! No, I swear. I swear. Who is K. Chapman? ♪ ♪ I don't know. [screams] She was my mother! She should have taught you how to tell the truth! I'm not lying! I'm not lying! I don't know her! ♪ ♪ Your own mother? ♪ ♪ Even dogs know their bitch from whence they came. My mother, the Mistress of the South, birthed over a thousand children before she died. She gave life to every witch in Oz, and even she found the time to care for me. Nurture me. But your mother couldn't care less about one baby girl? ♪ ♪ How rotten do you have to be for that? She must've sniffed it out. Something in you that's broken and couldn't ever be fixed. ♪ ♪ Go to hell. [chuckles] ♪ ♪ How did you get those? ♪ ♪ Those were hers. ♪ ♪ My sister's. [screams] So, August, can I count on you to build my arsenal? I'm prepared to make a very large, very substantial offer. You'll have to name your price. I want my dog back. Randall. He died last year, you know. I think it was last year. If you can bring Randall back to me... that would be splendid. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I just had a revealing conversation with the King. How long have you been ruling in his stead? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just an insolent child. Isn't that what you said? I need your help. You need mine. I was too young to remember the last attacks. But I grew up in its wake. The rebuilding of our kingdom. Yes, it was a marvel of innovation. We had no choice. When The Beast Forever came, you saved Emerald City... and left my kingdom to drown. My people to drown, my mother... If you had thought to save us, she'd still be alive. It's a great tragedy. It was a great loss. I may be the one wearing a mask, but I can see through yours just as clearly. What is it that you want? Whatever it is, it's yours. I want to see Emerald City laid to waste. And I want to see you drown in its suffering! And when The Beast returns, I shall have my wish. ♪ ♪ [pounding] [frustrated scream] [footsteps] Help me, please. She's gonna kill me. Yeah. As soon as she recovers. I have to get to The Wizard. Can you give me that key? Come on. You don't recognize me, do you? I was the boy you saved. From Mombi. Tip? How? Is that really you? I don't know who I am because of you. Because of me? Tip, I... I helped you when I had nothing to gain. And I helped you because you asked me to. And now I'm asking you... please. Please help me. You helping me was the worst thing that ever happened. So now I'm gonna do for you what I wish you'd done for me. Walk away. No. No, Tip. Tip. Tip. Tip. [knocks] Tip, please! Tip? [banging] Tip! 
 
 [indistinct chatter, light music] [cheers and applause] Sylvie, wait. Hey, hey, hey, it's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. Come on. Lead the way. If Dorothy's here, we'll find her. ♪ ♪ Listen to me, don't do this! I don't deserve to be here! [shrieks] [door slams shut] If it's any consolation, I don't belong here, either. Dorothy? ♪ ♪ Dorothy. ♪ ♪ Mom? Dorothy... [whimpers] How did you get here? Same as you. Is it really you? Oh, Dorothy. Dorothy. It's my fault. It's my fault you're not sure. I wasn't there for you when you needed me most. But if you just tell this witch what she needs to know, then we can go home. She's gonna let us go home? Baby, you just have to think back. Think back to when you killed the witch, okay? Just remember. That's all you got to do. You just... You got to remember. [whooshing] ♪ ♪ Do you know who I am? Witch... stern. Merciful and stern. [groaning] Why did you come for me?  I didn't! Are you one of Glinda's girls? Did she send you to hurt me? Who? My sister. [groans] My sister with a secret... My sister with a secret. ♪ ♪ [gunshot] [gasps] Glinda. ♪ ♪ She was trying to tell me about Glinda. Mom? [blow landing] ♪ ♪ Thanks for the memories. ♪ ♪ [sobbing] Hurry up. We're going to miss the festival. I said hurry up. Why should I do anything you say? Because I'm a princess. You're the worst human being I've ever met. What am I even doing here? You obviously hate me and now you want me to, what? Eat candy apples with you? Or am I supposed to trail behind you like some kind of pet? Or maybe I'm here to entertain you, so you can laugh at my clumsiness, my freakishness, is that it? What do you want from me? You're my friend. [scoffs] [laughs] Why are you laughing? Do you even know what a friend is? Of course I do. Have you ever had one before? I've always wanted a friend, I just... didn't know where to get one. No, you don't... "get" one, you earn one. How? I don't know, by thinking of them before yourself. Trying to be helpful, encouraging, or just... doing things together. [distant cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ Like going to a festival? ♪ ♪ I guess. ♪ ♪ So... ♪ ♪ This one girl felled my best soldier. I don't know what kind of power she used. But one moment I was up, and the next, down. It was this. [ominous music] Do you know what it is? ♪ ♪ [door opens] ♪ ♪ I think this is yours. Why are you helping me?

Thank you. ♪ ♪ We have to hurry. ♪ ♪ Our Mistress will be so pleased with me. ♪ ♪ She won't mind the mess one bit. [indistinct chatter] [chatter stops] Where's your mistress? ♪ ♪ How long have you had her? Less than a day. But she's been quite revealing. I told you to wait for me. Oh, don't worry. I'm certain she has more secrets to spill. Secrets? The ones our sister died with. If secrets were kept, they were kept from me, too. And what of your own? I harbor no secrets. Especially from you. You're the only family I have left. I hadn't seen our Eastern sister in years and now she's gone. Let time not be our enemy, as well. You hadn't seen her in years? ♪ ♪ Why? Did the girl tell you differently? The girl said all kinds of things. ♪ ♪ [panting] Mistress! The prisoner! Where is she? Escaped! You couldn't have listened to me this one time? I will find her! Your incompetence has cost me enough. [whimpering] I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me. Who is "they"? Her! Where is the girl? Ma'am? Tell her what you did. What I did? I walked in on her helping the prisoner! They ran at me and slammed the grate on me! Is this true? Ma'am, I've been preparing your tea all morning, just like you asked. Liar!

He's not sick. He's simply leaving us... without leaving us. So this is what it's like to feel normal. [chuckles] Can I ask you something? Why do I wear a mask? I'll tell you when we're friends. [cheers and applause] I have something to show you. What is it? It's a bullet, more powerful than magic. Something so powerful... that it can kill The Beast Forever.

Why do you hunt me? Nimbo! Why? I can't... Tell me! There was a wagon you drove, all right? We pulled you over and you drew your sword. Why? I tried to see what was inside. But you wouldn't allow it. Then you came at us, sword drawn. Ten men, you killed. Cut them down like they were nothing. [emotional music] No. Yes. If you don't believe me, look on your left side. All right?
