 Previously, on "Emerald City"... 
 I haven't seen our eastern sister in years. 
 If secrets were kept, they were kept from me too. 
 What kind of magic is this? 
 Magic strong enough to kill a witch. 
 [gunshot] 
 What is it? 
 A bullet more powerful than magic. 
 Sylvie, did you do this? 
 Can I count on you to build my arsenal? 
 How long have you been ruling in his stead? 
 When The Beast Forever came, you left my kingdom to drown. 
 I want to see Emerald City laid to waste. 
 Your men were right about me. I killed 'em. 
 All of them. 
 Do you know my mother? 
 Dorothy? You've come home. 
 [soft instrumental music] 
 ♪ ♪ I know how much you've invested in us, and it's paying off. Dr. Andrews, I was wondering... We... yes. We can generate enough wind to create clean, efficient energy. ♪ ♪ [beeping] Morning, Frank. Morning, Dr. Chapman. Will you call me Karen, for goodness sake? You've busted your butt all these years to earn that title. I'm gonna continue to address you like that. Here you go. Oh. Well, aren't you the gentlemen. You never help me with my lab coat. Would you like your own coat, Frank? Karen? Oh. Yeah. Ah, well you do so much around here, I don't see why not. Jane? Okay, let's fire her up. Let's put some energy on the grid, shall we? Frank? Yes? Are you taking notes? Always. When we reach full power, only hold a few seconds to minimize risk, understood? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, let's have some fun. Roberto? Okay, safety off. Smoke in the tube. And we got sheer conditions. Bring the heat, Roberto. [keyboard clacking] Opening vents. [tense music] It's consistent with the last trial. Creating energy out of thin air. How much? Too much. Backing her off. [keyboard clacking] Jane? Bring it down. I'm trying. [computer beeps] It's not working. [computer beeps] I'm locked out. Heat shield's gonna melt. [alarm blaring] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I'm shutting it down manually. No! No, Roberto! Just monitor me there. Roberto, you can't... [door slamming] [alarm blaring] How hot is it in there? 120 and climbing. Maybe I could help. Let me get on the computer.I 'm sure I can help. [wind howling] [air hissing] Ah! [gasps] Jane? Don't touch anything here. [rumbling] Oh, my God. Override's not working. Roberto? Roberto! We've got to get him out of here. ♪ ♪ Answer me. How do you know my name? I've known you since the day you were born. Here. In Oz. I would never hurt you. You've been trying to kill me since I got here. Yes, but how could I know it was you? That you were no threat? And what makes you think I'm not? Is that why you're here? To kill me? To take me back home? Your mother wouldn't approve. I loved your mother very much. You loved her? And she... loved me. For what purpose did you butcher my men? Where did the tunnel in Nimbo lead? I've told you. The memory of it is lost to me. And you think torture will see it returned? I believe this is what I deserve. I, too, did terrible things when I was a young man. A different man. But I wasn't tortured for my sins. I was rewarded for them. My punishment... my punishment is that I remember. As will you. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [wincing] ♪ ♪ [electric zapping] What else can you tell me about my mother? You could ask me anything you want. I owe you that much. Stay back. What? Just give me the gun, and I'll answer all your questions. No. One bullet, then. A bullet? One. As a gesture of trust. One bullet. It's how I'll earn your trust. Eh. Stay back, she's no threat! I have a hole in my shoulder that speaks otherwise. She's my guest. I've extended my friendship to her. Please reconsider. When I came upon her and the soldier from Nimbo, they seemed very close. Lucas. Where is he? Still think she poses no threat? Lucas is the one who was hurt by your men and he lost his memory because of it. So where is he? She's wrong. Anna just confirmed it. His memory's intact. But it is protected by magic. You want to earn my trust? You need to let me see him. Dorothy. Dorothy. Are you okay? [groans] I thought I'd never see you again. Listen to me. I need you to lie to The Wizard. I need you to tell him you remember something... anything. If not, they're going to kill you. No, Dorothy... I need to know the truth. And they have a way of getting it. So this is what you want? They can break the magic that keeps me from knowing myself. Who can? [door opens] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Nobody told me it would be a threesome. The girl you call Dorothy, the girl we've been searching for, the first true sign of The Beast Forever, is in your custody and you won't let us read her? No woman in the High Council is to touch her. But we're running out of time. The two moons grow closer and... Dorothy is not the problem. The soldier with the magic upon his head is a problem. Ev not building our weapons is a problem. You want to be of service to me, then you'll solve one of my real problems. I was hoping that we'd have a moment alone. I want you to take over for Elizabeth as head of the High Council. If that's your wish. Sir? Dorothy's reunion with the soldier. Did it reveal anything new? You knew it wouldn't. Yet you let her see him anyway. What sway does she have over you? You left...  before I finished with you. I had such grand plans for us. [tense music] Go make me some tea. ♪ ♪ I'm about to exhaust myself. You can't hurt me. I'm protected by the Wizard. ♪ ♪ But he's not. He's protected by magic. And the Wizard hates magic. Can you break it? I'll obliterate it. But it won't be pleasant. Hey, hold on. I can talk to the Wizard. I can stop this. No, I don't want you to. You don't have to do this. In the past, you risked your life to get answers. So let me do the same, please. [muttering] But I am not gonna stand by and watch you suffer. [speaking native language] Then go. I think she likes to watch. Shall we let her? If this is what you want. Let's see what lowly witch has cast a spell on you. ♪ ♪ [inhales] [both exhaling] ♪ ♪ [both gasping] [coughs] [pants] That's Glinda's magic! What secrets is she hiding behind those pretty eyes of yours? [gasping] [footsteps] Come along now. Hurry up. [dishes clatter] Jack? Jack, it's me. It's Tip. You're alive. No, don't touch me. I can't believe it's really you. Why didn't you help me? I thought I'd killed you. So you just got on with it and left me to die? But you didn't. I can fix everything now. Please let me... No, we can't be fixed. I can't be fixed. [dramatic music] Jack, don't go. I love you! What does that mean? I don't know. I don't know what to say or how to say it right. All I know is, is you're my best friend. I was your only friend! Who's this, Jack? It's no one. Are you a no one, girl? You don't look like a no one. What is your name... little someone? Tip. And how do you know my Jack? We grew up together. We were best friends. Is this the one who killed you? Did you tell her what you are now? Why? I don't want to. You have to. Children can't be corrected if they don't know what they've done wrong. Show her. Show her what she did to you. ♪ ♪ [mechanical churning] [gasps] The old Jack may have been your friend... but the new Jack is mine. Come on, Jack. ♪ ♪ Please. ♪ ♪ Glinda's spell is Cardinal Magic. Magic that can't be broken. Well, then let him go. I can't break it. But I can work around it. How? If I had a conduit. Someone close to you, someone special... to slip past your defenses. No. Will this protect him? Think of it as a back door into the mind through the heart. If you're feeling sappy... Dorothy, don't listen to her. She's only trying to hurt you. Oh, absolutely. If your attachment isn't strong enough, you'll both lose your minds. Either way works for me. Look at me. Don't put yourself at risk. Do it. Charcoal, saltpeter, and brimstone. It can pierce hardened steel. It's called a bullet. With your infrastructure, you can produce thousands of these and the guns that fire them. You take half to fortify your defenses, and I take half to defeat The Beast Forever. Where were these 20 years ago when the Beast rained down on my kingdom? When they could have saved my mother from being swallowed alive? Bullets and guns are no match for a beast made of water. The beast that's upon us now is made of flesh and blood. A bullet is the fastest way to stop a beating heart. Where's Randall? Have you seen him? Father. I-I heard him barking in my dreams, but when I woke, he... The dog is dead. Father, he died when I was a child. No, no, I heard him! He's here. I heard him. Yes. Yes, of course you did. I'm sorry, Father, I'll...I 'll come and help you find him. You know I'm always here for you. Lady Ev, can you commit to my cause? With this? Bring me the gun and we'll talk. [speaking native language] Come on, Lucas, let me in. Let me in. [tense music] ♪ ♪ What's in the wagon? ♪ ♪ What's in the wagon? [girls humming] ♪ ♪ I suggest you let me pass. Show me now. Or I'll cut you down, I swear. [sharp tone ringing] Ah! What is it? [humming] ♪ ♪ [sharp tone ringing] Ah! My eye! [swords clashing] [grunting] Ah! Ah! [sharp tone ringing] Ah! [groans] ♪ ♪ Don't kill him! Let's string him up. Girls! Run! [girls screaming] ♪ ♪ What's he got? Don't let him swallow it! ♪ ♪ 
 
 [gasps] It can't be. [sighs] I need that gun. You could just take the weapon from the girl. I could've killed you, Eamonn... when I took this city from your king. But I spared your life. And gave it a new purpose. Because you are more valuable as my ally. Perhaps the same is true for Dorothy. The Mother Witch lives! And is breeding witches. For Glinda! She hid my own mother from me. Mother South is dead. No. She is alive. I saw young witches. Only she can make them. And the spell that held the secret was Glinda's. But Glinda, she watched the last of the witches get slaughtered by The Beast. What good would new ones be? Sober up, you fool! She's not going to use them against the beast. She's going to use them against you. What did you think Glinda would do? You imprisoned every witch who practiced magic and repressed the ones who didn't. And now they're going to take Emerald City from you! They are going to take Oz from you with the very elements you outlawed! And whose side will you be on? Oh, you'll be the first to know. Enough! I let her in. You put spies under my roof. Why? The High Council. Anna. They've all betrayed me. I should return the High Council in pieces, her little errand boy, too. The soldier. When he surrendered, there was a child with him, a young girl. A witch. Find her. All my soldiers on the hunt. I killed men. Taking their skulls to Nimbo. You don't think me a monster? After what you saw? No. You were protecting those girls. And you risked your life for them. Why? The tunnel in Nimbo would have brought them to Glinda. You are sworn to her, as am I. He works for Glinda? You know me? There is a wagon in the load-out that'll take you north to Calcedon, Glinda's castle... she's ordered me to free you. There's, um... there's one of the witch girls in the city. I have to find her. There is no time. You must leave before The Wizard locks the gates. I'll go find her. You're on The Wizard's side of this. I'm not on anyone's side. Well, then you better choose. War is coming to Oz. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ It's late to be wandering. The Wizard told you I'm his guest. I can leave when I want. ♪ ♪ Or you could follow me. ♪ ♪ I'll take you to the girl. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ I just... I don't get it. What happened? Just keep moving, or we'll freeze to death. I keep thinking about Roberto. Oh. [wincing] [speaking native language] [gasps] [speaking native language] ♪ ♪ [speaking native language] Frank, stop! Stop! We mean no harm or disrespect. We are lost. We need your help. My name is Dr. Jane Andrews. I'm the leader of this group. ♪ ♪ Wait here. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [metal jangling] Toto! Hey, boy. [laughs] Is she... Asleep. ♪ ♪ Why are you helping me? Not you. ♪ ♪ I'll bring her safely to Glinda's. If you can get past my guards. ♪ ♪ There's your wagon, Sylvie, but there's too many guards. ♪ ♪ You have to stay here. I'm gonna go get help. Stay here. [dog whining] Keep her safe, Toto. Trust you. Good boy. I'll be right back. ♪ ♪ When you come back home, I'll make you a big fire. [chuckles] You can lie in front of that, and then we go hunting like we did in the old days. Just you and me. [chuckles] ♪ ♪ Jack. I asked you to find my father, yet I don't see my father. Were my instructions not clear? He's gone. He must've wandered. I can't find him anywhere. ♪ ♪ Frank? Frank. [laughs] Almost didn't recognize my own name. I need your help. And I need yours. There's still a lot that you don't know about me. Are you my father? [baby cries] Let's try this. Hey. Come here. [baby continues to cry] Oh. Little Dorothy. [baby cries] [laughs] [footsteps] Oh. Baby okay? Yes, she's fine. So was she really a witch? Most Merciful and Stern of the Eastern Wood? Yes. Real witch. Can she help us? She prefers to kill us. When we tore into this world, we caused a ripple effect. Something bad has come to these people because of us, and the only way to stop it is for us to leave. She's gonna send us home. How? She controls the weather. She can summon her own tornado. But we're going home? Yeah. We're going home! I'm not leaving. We all are. No, you can't decide things here, not for me. I decide. We all have to leave, that's the deal. Well, I'm not leaving. I brought us here. It was... it was a mistake. My computer malfunctioned. No. I locked you out to destroy your machine. Frank... What? She treats me like I was nothing. Like... you treat me like I'm stupid. I'm not stupid. I can do things. I'm smart, yeah? I found this new world here. Didn't I? Me. I'm not leaving it. What? I did! I did this. Roberto, what about him? You killed him, Frank! ♪ ♪ His name was Roberto. Your father. He was a smart man, a kind man. He died in the accident that brought us here. I'm sorry, Dorothy. I tried to save him. I don't trust you. Look at you. The way you dress, the way you act. That wig. You're just lying to everyone. [chuckles] I could say the same about you. We do what we need to survive. Which is why I need to ask you, where's the little witch? I can't tell you that. But if you let her go back to the north, she'll be safe, and so will you. ♪ ♪ Come! I have a proposition for you. Where are you? You're here somewhere, I know you are. I... I'm going to find you. Did you go running away again? Hmm? I know you're here... Where are you, boy? Where are you? Randall? [dog whimpers] [laughs] [dog barks] Here, boy. Randall. No barking. [laughs] [dog barking] Randall? [dramatic music] Randall? What is this? All the power in Emerald City is generated from underneath us. I was brought to Oz in a vortex chamber. This one here... [knocks] can send you home. Now? I just have one thing to ask of you first. I'll do anything. You were born in Oz... Oz brought you back. Have you even asked yourself why? Destiny. Your destiny. Just like mine a long time ago. You were brought back to Oz to save us all. I'm no savior. Then what are you? Are you just a girl from Kansas? Just a girl who misses her mother? Or are you more? More than just the things that you've lost. What do you want me to do? Stop Glinda. Stop this war from killing thousands of people and tearing this world apart. But you have your giants. So use them. No, their power's locked in the Prison of Abject. How can I kill a witch? With a gun. You've already proven that. I'm not gonna kill someone just so that I can go home. Are you sure?

I don't care what Glinda thinks. ♪ ♪ Calcedon lies beyond Gilliken Country. There's an abandoned farmhouse half a day past the old mining road. Stay the night there and continue north. ♪ ♪ Thank you. ♪ ♪ Was that her? The witch? The less you know, the better. What did Glinda do? She chose to fight back. Was I never meant to help The Wizard? You were here to learn his secrets. And once they were known? Then we wouldn't need a Wizard anymore. ♪ ♪ Anna. Anna. You see? They're all working against me. I cleared the guards. The wagon will pass without being stopped. And no one will follow them. Clever plan. It was Dorothy's. When she gets to Glinda's, she'll stop this war before it even starts. You place too much trust in her. Yet she trusts me even more. But she gave you the only weapon that could've killed the witch. Not the only one. Glinda's always been cold as stone. Now she'll be dead like one. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Can you put this in some water? [soft instrumental music] ♪ ♪ [clicking] Yes. ♪ ♪ Yes. This is lead. Lead. ♪ ♪ Okay. ♪ ♪ This is a battery.
