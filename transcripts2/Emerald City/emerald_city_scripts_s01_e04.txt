 Previously on "Emerald City"... 
 My mother, her was in Oz. 
 Find the girl. She must die. 
 How long have you been in The Wizard's Guard? 
 I know what The Wizard's Guard did at Nimbo. 
 Beast Forever takes many forms. 
 So who stopped it before? 
 A wizard, with those. 
 I don't think you ever controlled the Giants. 
 I think their power is locked inside the Prison of the Abject. 
 What you are right now, that's what happens when the medicine itself wears off. 
 I'm a boy. I've always been a boy. 
 This is how you were born. What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry! This isn't me! Oh! [electricity crackling] [flame roaring] [tense music] [machine whirring] [grunting] It's all right. Don't be frightened. [somber music] ♪ ♪ No one deserves that fate. ♪ ♪ I'm a killer. Is that so? Captain! If you let me join your brigade, I'll kill for you. What will your family think about that? I have no family. Well, then maybe I do have a place for you. [branches snapping] We should be on the brick road. The Wizard's Guards are on the brick road. Yeah, well, we're moving too slowly. This rate, we're never gonna get to... Or we might just keep you alive. [dog barks] Your dog's doing that thing again. His name's Toto. Does he know that? Are you sure that coat belonged to your mother? Yes. K. Chapman. Karen Chapman. Yes, but K could be for anything. It could be for Katherine or Kordelia. Cordelia stars with C. Look, if you're gonna risk your life to see The Wizard, it'd just be nice to know that you have the right coat. Well, don't you want to see him, too? Don't you want to find out who you really are? Of course I do. Then? [dog barks] What do you want from me? Maybe he's just grateful to have you. Maybe we both are. It's you who saved my life. I did, didn't I? [soft dramatic music] [dramatic musical sting] [tense music] ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ It's not easy cleaning up a massacre. Wizard ordered me to burn down Nimbo. That's what I did. Captain. I think you'll want to see this. ♪ ♪ Did our men go inside? Not yet. And I'd advise against it. I will travel to Nimbo personally and determine if this is magic or... Couldn't determine the weather, could you? I'll go myself. Well, I should at least be by your side. You still need counsel. Yes... [tense music] Just not yours. ♪ ♪ [door opens] ♪ ♪ Are you putting me to death? To work. Can you hear me? You had a fall. But we're gonna fix you up. [panting] Tip... [stammering] Tip, Tip, Tip... There is no need to fight, Jack. [stammers] Tip. Tip... Breathe. [machine whirs] This won't hurt a bit. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ These are your stables? Hey! What was that for? ♪ ♪ Yes, Mistress, come over here. Where are we? Your new home. We'll keep her well. What are you doing? The first thing you'll need is a proper bath. Don't touch me. A clean orphan is a good orphan. I'm not an orphan! Isn't that right, Mum? Baptize her. ♪ ♪ I'm Dorothy. What's your name? Are you alone? Where did you come from? She doesn't understand you. Well, she may not understand me, but she seems to know you. Well, at least somebody does. But we have to go. We can't. Lucas, I'm not abandoning her. What happened to seeing The Wizard? What happened to getting home? There's a village a walk back, maybe she's from there? You walk into that village, The Wizard's Guards will kill you... She's alone. A child alone. [sighs] Yeah. Think about her parents. Wondering where she is, if she's dead or if she's alive... Dorothy. She's ever gonna come home. Dorothy. She's not you. We have to move. No. If you want, you can stay here with Toto. Stand guard. But I'm taking her home. Hello, Jack. Did you sleep well? Who are you? My name is Jane. Where's Tip? Tip? My friend. Oh, I'm sorry. You were quite alone when we found you. That's not possible. She wouldn't have left me. Well, she might have thought you were dead. We did. You were battered and broken and spilled into the street. What have you done to me? Well, saved your life, of course. It wasn't easy. And full recovery will take time. But... I think it's safe to say we've made you a new man. ♪ ♪ [screams] [ominous music] [continues screaming] [mutters indistinctly] Jack... [screams] Be safe. ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Look, if we don't find your parents, I'll bring you right back to him. He's watching out for us. ♪ ♪ What is this? [overlapping chatter] [overlapping animal sounds] [sounds swell in volume] [echoing] Why would anyone... [gasps] I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Shh, shh, shh, shh. [overlapping sounds continue] [sounds stop] I'm sorry. ♪ ♪ [mystical music] ♪ ♪ If I may? You may. Always. I thought you were displeased with me. I was. Was I wrong to challenge you? I'm taking you to Nimbo because you did. ♪ ♪ You were right. About the Giants. I can't, uh, bring them back. No, even if you could raise them, they won't kill The Beast Forever. ♪ ♪ Not this time. I have studied all the data, I have pored over all the facts, and I believe... I feel... This Beast will come from the sky. It will have a brain and a heart. It will be possessed of relentless strength. Then I'm already dead. No, don't you... Don't you see? If it has a heart, you can kill it. ♪ ♪ [rhythmic drumming] ♪ ♪ [panting] I can't! You have to work the limbs, Jack. Before scar tissue forms. Please, stop. You have to keep moving! I don't want this! You should have left me in the street. Like Tip. You had no right to help me! I take on many special projects for the Royal Army. This is what they pay me to do. So that's what I am? A project? We're all projects, Jack. All of us with missing pieces or damaged parts. You should be grateful I replaced yours. You took out my heart. And gave you a new one. One that will never break. That's where you're wrong. Today, I offer you a future. A future of hope. Of service. A chance to better yourselves. Under my tutelage, you shall join The Wizard's High Council and protect Oz against threats from without... No! Leave me alone! It's all right, my child, no one wants to harm you. You're safe here. And from within. I ain't taking no bath! [tense music] I don't belong here! ♪ ♪ That man lied to me! Oh, I'm sorry, Mistress. This one's just a little... Touch me again, I'll break your arm! It's all right, child. We only want to help you. You're alone in this world, yes? Afraid. Without options. Without purpose. I can give you all that you seek. I can give you a family. Which is clearly overrated. [speaking native language] _ You've come to poach for your cause, I've come to poach for mine. This girl looks like trouble. And where I come from, trouble pays. ♪ ♪ I'm afraid not, no. Are you sure you haven't heard of anyone looking for a child? I'm sorry, ma'am. Did you speak with the women at the boarding house? Yeah, and the teacher's at the school. I've been everywhere. You could try the constable. Or perhaps you'd rather not? Thank you. Thank you for your help. You're welcome. Sylvie! Oh, Sylvie! They found you. The butcher said he saw someone taking her 'round. Has she been with you long? Just since last night. Oh, she adores sweets. Let's get you some proper food and a warm bath. ♪ ♪ Thank you again. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Wait. ♪ ♪ I'll come with you. I would like to see Sylvie's home. ♪ ♪ [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Here we are. Thank you again. I'd offer you some food, but I'm afraid we don't have much. But we make do, don't we, love? ♪ ♪ Where's Sylvie's room? ♪ ♪ I beg your pardon? ♪ ♪ Sylvie's room. I'd like to see it. We have to go. We have to go. Now! Wait! Sylvie... We have to go! Come on! [whimpers] Wait! Lucas, stop! Lucas, those aren't her parents. We have to go back for her. No, The Wizard's Guards are everywhere. They'll find you before we ever find her. Dorothy. Dorothy! Seen a girl? None by here, no. [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Anything amiss at all? No, no, I ain't seen anything. ♪ ♪ Nothing unusual we've seen. Seen nothing. ♪ ♪ You shoot that, and everyone will mark you for a witch. Do you understand? I can take care of myself. But you won't, will you? Because ever since we met, you rush into things without a care whether or not you live or die. But some of us do care. ♪ ♪ Take off your clothes. What? You have no business being here. On the contrary, empowered young women are my business. And you just happened to pick the exact same orphanage at the exact same time? Coincidence. Can I go now? Both : No. Is it not enough that you have destroyed our reputation? Sullied our name. And now you're going to be so petty as to challenge me for these lost girls? You're absolutely right. I shouldn't challenge you. We should let them decide for themselves. What do you say? Me? Leave her out of this. Why? She's exactly what I'm looking for. Strong, spirited, vigorous. Come with me. You'll be treated with the utmost respect. Respect, yes. Love, no. You'll be untouched. Pure. Forever and always. And I offer you the chance to feel something. To make others feel something. To be worshiped as a courtesan. So you're saying my only choice as a girl is nun or whore? ♪ ♪ 
 
 Did I mention we sleep in? [grunting softly] [doors open] [glass shatters] [mystical music] ♪ ♪ Boo! [gasps] Jane? No. ♪ ♪ Are you like me? I'm not like anyone. Do you think you could roll that thing over here? I could. But? I won't. ♪ ♪ Seriously? Who will I be today? A jackass? That was Tuesday. Perhaps I should be pretty? People like pretty. I think people generally prefer nice. Mice? Nice! Because from down there, you might see plenty. Ha! ♪ ♪ Bravo. One for the freak. Excuse me? Takes one to know one. ♪ ♪ [tense music] ♪ ♪ It's a privilege, sir. Just lead on, Captain. You burnt our homes! You burnt our children! All right, it's all right! ♪ ♪ Okay. It's all right. This man here has a grievance. You've lost someone. Her mother. My wife. ♪ ♪ We've all lost someone. Because of you. ♪ ♪ There's no magic here. ♪ ♪ Anna? ♪ ♪ [explosion booms] [screams] [all scream and gasp] Guards! ♪ ♪ Anna? Anna? ♪ ♪ Anna. ♪ ♪ It's gone. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [chickens clucking] ♪ ♪ [knocks] ♪ ♪ [panting] ♪ ♪ [ragged breathing] ♪ ♪ Sylvie? ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Did you do this? Sylvie? Sylvie, come here. [gasping] ♪ ♪ I'm gonna get you out of here, all right? We're gonna go back to Lucas. Okay? ♪ ♪ [whimpers] Close your eyes. Close 'em. ♪ ♪ Do you feel better? Be difficult to feel any worse. I thought I'd lost you. I don't know what I would have done. You have others to counsel you. I've never met anyone like you. Not just that, but also... Don't. You must think me the fool. Never. But I... I chose this path. Service over pleasure. And I cannot stray. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ There may be other villages like this. People like the Alderman, who refuse to follow you. ♪ ♪ Are you suggesting I kill him? No. You'll only make him a martyr. Then what? You must turn him. ♪ ♪ [sighs] [gasps] You're new, right? And hopefully gone by tomorrow. Don't you want to be adopted? No. I just want to disappear, I just want to forget... forget everything. Maybe Glinda can help you. Give you a new life. Yeah. I trust her even less than her sister. Wait. West wanted you, too? I don't think she's that discriminating. Oh, but she is. And if all you want to do is forget, she can show you how. I don't want to forget that way. Have you ever tried it? No. It's not so bad once you get used to it. And sometimes, it... it takes away everything else. Like nothing else exists. It's the best kind of forgetting. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ [horse chuffs] ♪ ♪ My apologies, sir. ♪ ♪ So... the girl who fell from the sky. ♪ ♪ [soft dramatic music] [panting] ♪ ♪ Jane, look at this.

Your new world awaits. ♪ ♪ I knew it was you. In the water. I knew it was you the whole time. You weren't fooling anyone. I've heard enough from my sister. I don't need any more from you.

[ominous music] ♪ ♪ No magic in Nimbo. ♪ ♪ Is that right, Jermiah? ♪ ♪ Where did this tunnel lead to? What was its purpose? You're the village Alderman. I have no village.

Fortunately, she recovered. ♪ ♪ Do you know the difference between science and magic? Only that one is a lie. Ah. Which one is that? Oz is a land of enchantment. Magic is its heart. Yet this enchantment could not save you from The Beast Forever. We did not need to be saved. The Beast comes because it must. To cleanse and purify. This is how it's been forever. Where was your science for my wife? And this village? Will it save my future grandchild? ♪ ♪ Excellent question. ♪ ♪ For the crime of murdering the Mistress of the eastern wood... by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz... ♪ ♪ I commit you to d... ♪ ♪ This sword.

And his daughter. ♪ ♪ Jack, this is Lady Ev. Princess Langwidere. ♪ ♪ Of course you are. Thank you, Jane. That will be all. That will be all what? I must leave, Jack. I'm not staying here, am I? I'm afraid you don't have a choice. In case you weren't aware, you are walking and talking at the expense of our kingdom. The least you can do is offer your gratitude. Was that the deal? Build me, then sell me? No. I'd rather hoped you'd want to stay in my care. Then why are you leaving? The princess met you... she liked you, and... ♪ ♪ Now she owns you. Owns me? ♪ ♪ You believe she's a witch? I don't know. I don't think she wanted to hurt those people. But she obviously felt threatened. What did they want with her? In my world, people just prey on children because they can. Is there magic in your world? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, but it's different. We have science, and... technology. And what's that? You'll see.
