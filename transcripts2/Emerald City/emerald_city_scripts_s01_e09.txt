 Previously on "Emerald City"... 
 You are the only child of Samuel and Katherine Pastoria. 
 What kind of a name is Ozma? 
 It means "Leader of Oz." 
 Dorothy's not an assassin. The Wizard sent her to kill me. 
 Take her life and your heart will be free. 
 Stop Glinda. 
 But you have your giants. Use them. 
 Their power is locked in the Prison of the Abject. 
 Mistress East and I, we had a partnership. 
 Prison of the Abject. We can't unlock it. 
 A witch's spells are her own. I'm not drinking a witch's insides. 
 You want revenge for your parents. 
 You want to destroy the Wizard. 
 Then taste my sister's magic.

 Possessions can be lost.

 Tell them to put down their guns and join us. 
 Tell them or you die. 
 Then you get nothing. 
 Why don't you try and convince them? 
 Soldiers of Ev, we can fight together or we can die apart. 
 And the first death will be the most tragic and unnecessary death of your Queen if you don't put down your weapons. 
 Madame Queen? 
 What is your wish? 
 Last chance to save your life. 
 Let us be... an example. 
 My life is worth nothing unless you stand with me against this man. 
 Never surrender your weapons! 
 Oh, you put them down!
