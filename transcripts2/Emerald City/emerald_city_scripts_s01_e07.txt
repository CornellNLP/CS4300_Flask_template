 Previously on "Emerald City"... 
 You were protecting those girls. 
 Why? 
 For Glinda. 
 You are sworn to her. As am I. 
 This vortex chamber can send you home. 
 One thing to ask of you first: stop Glinda. 
 She gave me the only weapon that could have killed the Witch. 
 Not the only one. 
 When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it even starts. 
 Randall. 
 I need your help. Can I count on you to build my arsenal? 
 [all gasping] 
 The Mother Witch lives and breathes for Glinda! 
 I saw young Witches. 
 She's not going to use them against The Beast. She's going to use them against you. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Spread out. [chatter] Every house. Every girl. ♪ ♪ [pounding on door] Open up. [all clamoring] In the name of The Wizard. We're here by order of The Wizard. Open up! Open! Open the door! [children screaming] What are you doing? That's my daughter! [children screaming] ♪ ♪ She's an innocent child! A plague, carried by young girls, threatens the city. All of them must be seen by the medic. Mila's not sick. That's for the medic to decide. Daddy, please! Daddy! Eamonn, Eamonn. It's me, Miller. You know me. Don't do this. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, please! [child screams] I won't let you take her. [grunts] Please! Daddy! [children screaming] Go to your homes. Shut the doors. Or death will come to all of you. I have known the girl since birth. She's no witch. Every girl must be inspected. If Glinda's witches are hiding in Emerald City and my people find out, I'll lose them. You may be losing them now. The people are scared. Good, people don't revolt when they're scared. They revolt when they're angry, if they think I've lost control. [all whispering] And the fate of the High Council? What would you have me do with them? I haven't decided. If anyone tries to leave, kill them. [whispering continues] Come on, Sylvie. [grunts] Quick stop, and then we have to keep moving. Look at her. She's so free. For the moment. So are you. Yes. Although apparently you're sworn to serve someone named Glinda. And what about you? You're protected by The Wizard? He knew my parents. Ah. He was my first real connection to them. [tense music] You know, he's not as bad as you think. Apparently Glinda thinks he's worse. ♪ ♪ Look, Lucas, about The Wizard... I know, his guards should be pursuing us, but I can't figure out why they aren't. ♪ ♪ [horse hooves clomping] I'm sorry for your loss. He wasn't my loss. He was my father. I'm sorry he died. He didn't die. He was murdered. It's just the more I see of everything, the more I realize how hard it all is for you. Why are you talking? I'm trying to help. Everything you say is wrong. Everything about you is wrong. I thought that's why you liked me. What about that girl back at The Wizard's castle? Does she like you? Tip? No, she hates me. And so do you, it seems. Are you pressing me for sympathy? Yesterday, I was a princess. Today I am an orphan and a queen all at once. What matter is it a girl hurt your feelings? It's more than that. Look at me. Stop the carriage! Wait, why? Leave me to feel sorry for myself. I meant nothing but kindness. You missed. [groans] [grunts] [distant screaming] [grunts] [screaming continues] Oh, great, the Screaming Forest. Thanks! [screaming continues] [grunts] Oh, Elizabeth mentioned a farmhouse outside of Gilliken. We should make it by dark. [clears throat] [wolves howling] [Toto barking] [howling continues] [Toto barking] [dark music] Oh. Sylvie? Sylvie! Sylvie! [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [wolves growling] Sylvie! ♪ ♪ Sylvie! ♪ ♪ [wolves growling] ♪ ♪ Sylvie! ♪ ♪ [sonic boom] [wolves whining] [solemn music] ♪ ♪ It's cruel what they did to her, taking away her hearing. Why would the Witches do that? Maybe to protect her. But lucky for her, you learned a new trick. I didn't even think about it. The gauntlets. They... they just did something. You can control them now. They're becoming part of you. Maybe. ♪ ♪ Like some other things too. The dog? Yeah. The dog. And Sylvie. Ah, well, good. I'm glad everyone's included. They are. ♪ ♪ I'm gonna check the house, make sure it's safe. You keep her close until I know. [birds chirping] I have an idea. Do you want to play a game? It's the game I used to play when I was your age in Kansas. It's called Somewhere. Somewhere in the meadow, there is a... scarecrow. You're good at this game. Oh, here's an easy one. Somewhere in the meadow, there's a dove. Yeah. Can you hear the birds singing? Now, I'm gonna take the things out of your ears. It's okay. Nothing you can hear can hurt you. Do you trust me? Okay. [birds cawing and insects buzzing] It's okay. It's okay. I know it's a lot. I know. Just focus on one thing. Focus on the dove. Come on. [chirping and buzzing quiets] [dove cooing] Can you hear it? [dove cooing] Dorothy? Is something wrong with the house? I don't want you to get hurt. What do you mean? Sylvie. You're gonna have to give her up. [dark music] Glinda. [overlapping screams] [mumbling] Mother. [overlapping screams] How could you lie? ♪ ♪ I need to see your Mistress. My mistress isn't well. Shocking. ♪ ♪ Mistress! ♪ ♪ No need to be shy. We have time. With looks like yours, it takes very little. Then you mustn't be very good. Give me a whore with an attitude. [blade swishes] ♪ ♪ I'm not that kind of girl. ♪ ♪ Mistress West. Come on. [moans] Come on. I've quarantined all the girls in the city within age, and I need for you to come... Mistress, get up. And single out witches among them. Come. You're still here. Yeah, I'm still here. Come on. There you go. There we go. Give The Wizard an answer. I won't help you kill them. No, not me. I've never killed a single witch in my life. Glinda has. Nearly all of them. She sent them to die against The Beast Forever. [quietly] And I helped her. [sniffles] I killed them too. I won't help either of you repeat the past. [sighs] Glinda hid your mother from you. Yes. She built an army of witches on secrets and lies. ♪ ♪ Do you have a family? Yes, I... Yes. They're all cheaters and liars. ♪ ♪ But all you have. Now, Glinda, she's willing to sacrifice all of those little girls just like the last time. But me... I want to help you save them. Mm. ♪ ♪ If... I find them... ♪ ♪ You give them to me, to my care, with a promise to protect them from whatever comes. Yes. I give you my word. ♪ ♪ Why mix? The vegetables? I don't know. I guess it's what makes a good stew. The more the merrier. Um... cook. [footsteps approaching] You're right about Sylvie. I don't want to give her up. She's Glinda's. Glinda isn't even her mother. She's just a stranger we know nothing about. I know, but this is what was planned for her. And who gets to decide that for anyone? It's the way the world works. What if we decide to keep her from Glinda? Protect her? I thought we were on the same side here. Do you want her fighting in a war that could kill her? No, of course not. Then we are on the same side. Are we? [solemn music] ♪ ♪ [scattered gasps] [dark music] ♪ ♪ None of them witches. How can you be certain? When you find one, you'll know. [children screaming] [pounding on door] [all clamoring] [screaming continues] Come here. Come here, you. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ You see her back there? Checked over there... [whispering] ♪ ♪ [screams] [distant screaming] [grunting] [screams continue] [ominous music] [grunting] [panting] [distant screams continue] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Rust. [breathing heavily] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [metal squeaking] Help! Help! Help! You have mother? Um... yes. But I don't know her. Then who? Um... my Aunt Em is like my mom. She loves me just as much, and I love her. Do you have a mother? You'll find her someday. But until then, you're not alone. Sweet dreams. [solemn music] ♪ ♪ Is she asleep? She will be soon. ♪ ♪ Good. Well, I have first watch. You've been first-watching all day. ♪ ♪ I can't let you do this. ♪ ♪ I'm fine. No. The Wizard guards, they're not coming. ♪ ♪ What? They're not coming because The Wizard let us go. ♪ ♪ Why? He wants to help me. So you lied to me? Yes. I lied. ♪ ♪ I lied because... if you're with Glinda, if you fight for her, we're not on the same side. ♪ ♪ There's only one person I fight for since the moment we met. ♪ ♪ And you for me. ♪ ♪ Remember? ♪ ♪ [unintelligible shouting] Who made it out? None. Two of ours were inside. And the girl. Then she's dead, and we don't need Mistress West. She's gone. Not if she's a witch. [dark music] ♪ ♪ Wait. Can you really do this, or is it some kind of death wish? Mistress? ♪ ♪ She's alive. [speaking witch-tongue] _ [suspenseful music] She's a witch. Bring the carriage. Get these people out of here! [unintelligible shouting] Aah! What is this? I have to protect my people. By locking her up like an animal? I'm not leaving this to chance. They can see her. Grab her! [speaking witch-tongue] ♪ ♪ Aah! ♪ ♪ [all shouting] Liar! [shouting continues] ♪ ♪ Keep them back. No one gets through. ♪ ♪ [speaking witch-tongue] _ We need to go now! We need to move! Block off the streets. You! Come with me now! Or my people will rip you apart! [crowd shouting] You stole our daughters! Liar! You're a fraud! You promised to protect her! You should have secured her when you had the chance. I had her, and then you scared her with that cage. I'm going back for her. You will not! Your hands are tied, as are mine. You can't just leave her! [crowd shouting] all : Fraud! Fraud! Fraud! Fraud! ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ I left her behind. I made her feel safe, and I left her. That's how I killed all my sisters. I took away their fear. I gave them milk of the poppy to make them forget their pain, and then I sent them out to fight. And none returned. ♪ ♪ Because of me. ♪ ♪ And now... I've betrayed another. [distant screams] [distant horse whinnies] [distant thumping] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [thumping, whinnies, screams approaching] [horse whinnies] ♪ ♪ [woman laughing] I knew you couldn't be so mean to leave me here. But I am. I did. Are you gonna help me or not? [distant screams continue] What's that? Wheeler tree sap. Some of my masks have moving parts. Grease things up, get them moving... Since you've stopped. Uh-uh. I could leave your screams to the forest and the things that go bump in it. Stop! [distant wailing] [metal squeaking] All right, do it. [metal creaking] [grunts] [solemn music] ♪ ♪ Top done. Bottom time. [distant screams continue] Give me your word not to go anywhere you shouldn't. I give my word as a lady. ♪ ♪ C-c-cold. [chuckles] ♪ ♪ Oh... you gave your word. As a lady. But I am queen now. Okay. ♪ ♪ [breathing heavily] [chuckles] There. Done. What? Really? You tell me. ♪ ♪ [grunting] ♪ ♪ Everything's working properly, then. Yeah. It is. ♪ ♪ So what do we do now? More of that? [chuckles softly] We could if we stayed. Screw the witches, and damn The Beast. We could batten down the hatches here and take care of each other. I wish I could have that wish. I've never been this happy. [laughs softly] Your face doesn't seem to know it just yet. I'm going home. Yeah. Someday. But until we figure out... No. Soon. If I can convince Glinda to not go to war with The Wizard, The Wizard can take me home. He knows how. [solemn music] You made a deal with him? Yeah. A deal that saved us both. How... how could you let Sylvie love you if you knew you were leaving? How could you let me? If you're on my side, you'll stay here and keep her safe. ♪ ♪ What? Where are you going? To face Glinda. ♪ ♪ Now? Are you insane? What... without even saying good-bye? I can't. You'll explain. No. No, I won't. I can't let an innocent girl fight a war she knows nothing about. This is for her. What exactly are you gonna do here? You're just gonna reason with a Cardinal Witch? Whatever it takes. Kill her if I have to. Words without point, Dorothy. You don't know what opposes you or how to stop it. I haven't known that since I got here. Why can't you just be honest here? You're afraid of what this is... Us, me... that we're all gonna leave you, just because your mother did. ♪ ♪ No. So you're not running away? Leaving us to lose you, just like Em and Henry? I have to go back. ♪ ♪ I'm sorry.

[grunting] Sylvie! [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Where's Sylvie? Where's Sylvie? [both panting] Sylvie? Sylvie? [dramatic music] Sylvie? [panting] She's the one doing this. Why? She heard us fighting. She's stopping me from leaving. Sylvie, come on. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. I promise you. Maybe... maybe there's a way we can all three stay together. [rumbling, creaking subsides] Would you like to come to Kansas with me? Somewhere. Yeah. We can play Somewhere. It's not running away if you come too. [solemn music] I'm the man of the house, aren't I? ♪ ♪ [horse hooves clacking] ♪ ♪ My father's suite. They've made it mine. It's nice. When I was younger, I used to play with his crown. Put it on my head. But it was just a game. [quietly weeping] It's not what I wanted. No. Please stay. My father was the only one to see me as I truly am. I need someone to see me now. Wait. You don't have to do that. I do see you. [sentimental music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ I've lied to you... All of you... About your daughters. And for that, I am ashamed. I am deeply ashamed.

[crowd murmuring] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ [gasps] ♪ ♪ [birds chirping] [whimpering] You were too young. The Wizard exhausted your magic. It may be more merciful to use this. I break my vow...

That's not true. I took it from the place where I grew up. The crest is King Pastoria's... handed down to his daughter at birth. His daughter? The Princess. [stirring music] Ozma. ♪ ♪ [Toto barking] We're here, Dorothy. And we're not going any further until you figure out what you're doing. The gauntlets. You'll use them against Glinda. I can control them if I want something badly enough. So, if you have to kill Glinda to get home, they should work. [Toto barking] Stay, Toto. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [door closes] ♪ ♪ We've come to see the Witch of the North... ♪ ♪ Sent by Elizabeth of The Wizard's High Council. ♪ ♪ Glinda knows me. ♪ ♪ Not this one. She's with me. That won't be necessary. ♪ ♪ Roan. Young lady, I'm grateful for what you've done. ♪ ♪ You've returned two very important people to me. I'm not returning them. Lucas and Sylvie decide for themselves.
