 Santa Anna : We will divide the army into multiple divisions to pursue and destroy what's left of the rebel army. 
 I have vital news. Go. 
 (Whooping) 
 (Girl screams) 
 What happened, boy? 
 Comanche. 
 Comanches. 
 (Horses whinnying) 
 Ahh! 
 Santa Anna : This is not the work of a ghost This is the work of a man! 
 Come to relieve me, Tom? 
 Give me one good reason why I shouldn't. 
 I can't think of one. 
 No! (Shrieks) 
 You want to kill me? 
 Houston : Gentlemen, what do you remember? 
 All : Remember the Alamo! 
 I am waiting. 
 Hyah!

 Houston : Gentlemen, let's be clear. 
 I would choose death before betrayal. 
 But there is no deceit in death. 
 Betrayal is the willful slaughter of trust. 
 Sherman : Sir, we saw the field... 
 Your orders were not to engage. 
 Your insubordination could have cost us dearly. 
 As of this moment, you are now reassigned to second infantry. 
 Sir... 
 Now, get out of my sight. 
 Cavalry now belongs to Lamar. 
 Any objections? 
 We've bloodied them, Sam. 
 Perhaps we could regroup for a counterattack. 
 General, they're on the defensive. 
 Houston : I require trust from my officers. 
 Houston : Towards the Sisters here. 
 Take out the main barricade and several points beyond. 
 Line of infantry 1,000 yards wide. 
 First Regiment here. 
 Baker's rifles here. 
 Sherman's regiment on the flank. 
 Baker : Well, I vote we receive an attack. 
 Houston : It's not up for a vote, Mosley. 
 Besides, that's exactly what Santa Anna thinks we'll do. 
 Now, you might reconsider. 
 We ought not to leave the security of the woods. 
 Hockley : Where are the war dogs now? 
 Houston : Colonel Lamar, I want your cavalry on the right. 
 Colonel Seguin and his Tejanos will man the rearguard. 
 Seguin : No. Unacceptable. 
 Understand, Juan, the courage of you and your men is not in question here. 
 There is such a deep-rooted hatred towards Mexicans that I fear your men may have to duck more than Santanista bullets. 
 The killing may become indiscriminate. 
 The blood of our comrades has earned us a place alongside you, General. 
 My company insists on a frontline attack, come what may. 
 Houston : We'll need a way to distinguish your Tejanos from Mexican soldiers. 
 We'll wear... goose feathers as long as we can sink our teeth into Santa Anna's neck. 
 I may have something else. 
 Let's use these instead. 
 (Birds chirping) 
 (Coughs) 
 Karnes : Goll dang. 
 General Cos. 
 Deaf. Deaf! 
 Mexican reinforcements. 
 Best tell Houston. 
 (Soldiers chattering indistinctly) 
 Smith : They must've been marching all night. 
 Karnes : They got to be tuckered. 
 Best get before they see us. 
 Yep. 
 Houston! 
 Fuego! 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Yelps) They see us. 
 Run! 
 Excuse me, Señor Presidente. 
 General Cos' troops are all present and accounted for. 
 But exhausted from a long march. 
 They've been up all night. 
 So have I. 
 Your Excellency, we should attack now. 
 No. 
 Houston wants us to attack so he can cut us down from the cover of those trees. 
 So we'll wait until Filisola and Urrea arrive? 
 Yes, with overwhelming number, we can surround them. 
 See? 
 Houston will have nowhere to run. 
 Feed the men in shifts and let them rest. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Houston's skirmish yesterday made no tactical sense. 
 I don't like it. 
 Smith : General, we take that bridge, you won't have to worry about Santa Anna's reinforcements no more. 
 You'll be all by your lonesome. 
 You know I can't afford to spare you even one extra man. 
 Forgive me, but destroying that bridge will cut off our retreat as well. 
 Baker : That's a good point. 
 Then we'd better not lose. 
 Position a crack squadron of dragoons to protect Vince's Bridge at all costs. 
 It's our lifeline. 
 Almonte : Would it not be better to abandon this position until we can rejoin all our armies and then pursue Houston on the offensive? 
 Why? 
 We have him! 
 Here and now. 
 Let his men sweat it out while our soldiers rest. 
 Almonte : Yes, sir. 
 What can I do to comfort you, Antonio? 
 Knowles, get your slack ass up. 
 (Water splashes) 
 Morning, sweet pea. 
 Princess is up. 
 Lazy old bitty. 
 Come on, now. 
 Saddled up your horse for you. 
 Beans : Come on out. There she is. 
 Come on, sweet pea. 
 Aww, looking pretty. 
 Gator : Hey, girl. 
 Smith : All right. That's enough. 
 It's time. 
 Knowles, mount up. 
 I don't know what's ailing you, son, but whatever it is, you leave it here at camp. 
 Kick up! 
 (Martial bugle music) 
 Hockley : The general is not to be disturbed. 
 Come no further. 
 Baker : What's he doing? Sleeping? 
 Hockley : Step away. Step away. 
 Sherman : He's awake for 56 days straight; Now he sleeps? 
 Lamar : If he truly wanted to attack, it should've been at first light. 
 The weather has been fickle. 
 It's in our favor now. 
 (Horses galloping) 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Rusk : Lorca. 
 (Horse neighs distantly) 
 Where's General Houston? 
 Lamar : State your business. 
 Saith Jehovah, "Raise your sword "with abandon and outrage till the rivers run red with heathen blood." 
 Amen. 
 If you've come to bear arms with us, then I'll assign you to Colonel Lamar's cavalry. 
 I'll be assigned no man. 
 Be clear on that. 
 But we'll kill Mexicans alongside you till every brown breathing b*st*rd lies dead. 
 Fair enough. 
 When I'm ready to attack, I'll give you a sign. 
 Watch for it. 
 "Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord. 
 Sam, you can't trust that loco. 
 This day, I'd ally with the devil himself. 
 I think you just did. 
 (Horse nickers) 
 Oh. 
 (Knowles humming) 
 (Yelps) 
 Tsk. 
 Quietly : Mind the horses. 
 All right. All right. All right. 
 Knowles, damn it. 
 Listen ti me. 
 Ain't you supposed to be with the horses? 
 I know. Just listen. 
 I was wondering, if we blow up the bridge, how are we supposed to get back across it? 
 We don't. 
 (Water sloshing) 
 You hear that? 
 Something's in the marsh. 
 (Water sloshing) 
 Man : Halt! Hands in the air! 
 Stop right there, or I'll shoot! 
 (Gunshots) 
 Identify yourself! 
 We said stop! 
 It's me! 
 It's me, Manuel Flores. 
 Cease fire! He's one of us. 
 Manuel, what news? 
 Santa Anna's army is resting. 
 His forces are tired. 
 Emily West says it's time to attack. 
 More reinforcements are coming. 
 And Miss West herself? 
 She said, "Tell General Houston it was right to wait, but attack now." 
 Very well. 
 Sir.

 One man took that freedom from you. 
 One man sent your sons and brothers to unmarked graves, your women and children left homeless and afraid, burnt your farmlands, reduced your cherished homesteads to ashes... one man, a tyrant, Santa Anna. 
 Today... today we avenge our dead. 
 We honor our loved ones.

 I will not.

 We end it all now. 
 My only reason for living is to slay him. 
 Ride on out of here while you can. 
 Shut your mouth, boy. 
 Shoot me first. 
 You don't think I will?

 Mm. 
 You want to know my guess? 
 You and Gator are going after that bank. 
 Gator's so full of bunkum, if he told me water was wet, I'd have to poke my finger in and feel for myself. 
 Kit didn't trust him. 
 You ought not to neither. 
 Well, I ain't robbing no bank. 
 I'm a hero now. 
 Got a reputation to uphold. 
 Well, if you want to ride your hero ass along with me, you're welcome. 
 Well... no, thank you, my friend. 
 I reckon I'll just stay put. 
 Good luck with that sh1t. 
 Tell them boys I say adios. 
 All right. 
 You lily-livered weasel. 
 How in the hell am I supposed to take this bank by myself? 
 Well, why don't you recruit Karnes and Anderson? 
 Houston : Tom, I want you to ride on ahead to Burnett. 
 Formalize our agreement with Santa Anna. 
 Buckley and Seguin will take charge of the army while I'm away. 
 Rusk : You get that leg healed up, Sam. 
 Texas needs you. 
 (Grunts) 
 You just gonna leave me behind, is that it? 
 Well, I'll be damned. 
 I'd about given up on you. 
 I had to lay Charmaine to rest. 
 Karnes : Partner, damn. 
 You look like something the cat dragged in that the goat wouldn't eat. 
 Right here. 
 (Coughs) 
 Let it out. 
 Let it on out. 
 Houston : Private Pitt. 
 The man that captured Santa Anna ought to make a damn good Ranger. 
 Your first assignment: Take Captain Smith home to his wife. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Sorry to hear about Charmaine. 
 Smith : Anybody fetch me a new mount yet? 
 Doc Ewing : Get a wagon and lay him down in back. 
 You're in no condition to go, Deaf. 
 What'd you say, Sam? 
 You need to look me in the eye. 
 I said you're not going. 
 And who's gonna look after your old crippled ass? 
 Karnes will take command of the Rangers. 
 Just gonna throw me away. 
 Is that it? 
 Go home, old friend. 
 The Republic of Texas is grateful for your service. 
 Go on. 
 Doc Ewing : All right. 
 Colby, get him in the medical tent. 
 Got to get Houston to New Orleans and Santa Anna to his peace talks. 
 You take care of yourself, Deaf. 
 Houston : Let's move out. 
 Smith : Sam. 
 Sam. 
 I'll tell you when I'm done. 
 Yah. 
 (Groaning) 
 (Fly buzzing) 
 Doc Ewing : You just had one, Sam. 
 That's quite enough. 
 Mmm! 
 You think you are a man of destiny, but all I see is President Jackson's puppet. 
 All I see is a man in a chicken coop. 
 I am defending my people against pirates like you, stealing our land. 
 History will sweep you aside with a footnote. 
 Perhaps. 
 Better a footnote than a whole book of abominations. 
 (Chuckles) 
 No difference with what you did in San Jacinto. 
 We are men on opposite sides, yet there is much we share. 
 A love of our countries, a love of... other things. 
 A remarkable woman, Miss West. 
 An extraordinary woman, especially in bed when she's screaming with pleasure. 
 I hear women are quite skilled at pretending that sort of thing. 
 "Oh, Antonio, yes, yes, more. 
 Give me more." 
 Give him another one, Doc. 
 He's wrestling with what defeat tastes like. 
 (Water splashing) 
 Colonel Portilla's got Emily West. 
 Wants to trade her for Santa Anna. 
 A whore for a chief of state. 
 Portilla is losing his mind. 
 Give this back to him. 
 Flores. 
 Sir? 
 (Speaking foreign language) 
 Yes, sir. 
 Anderson! 
 Yeah. 
 Get ready. 
 God is with us. 
 Ha! 
 Beads and whiskey always worked for me before. 
 Whoa, whoa. Keep your head, mister. 
 Else you're liable to lose it along with your scalp. 
 Everything's set. 
 I need my volunteers. 
 Woman : Get out there, Phineas. 
 You be a man. 
 All right. 
 I can give you Clarence and the other Negroes. 
 Best if I stay back and watch over the children and womenfolk. 
 Bigfoot, let's meander. 
 Well, move it. 
 (Horse whinnies in the distance) 
 Must've hanged your president by now. 
 When I know that's true, I'll use you for my men's amusement. 
 And where will you go? 
 Texas... they'll hang you for Goliad. 
 In Mexico, they'll shoot you for San Jacinto.
