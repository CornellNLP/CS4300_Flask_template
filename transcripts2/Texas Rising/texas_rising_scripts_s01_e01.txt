 Mexican General Santa Anna battles to reclaim the land. 
 U.S. President Andrew Jackson is hesitant to intervene, and Texas has no choice but to declare itself an independent nation. 
 Outnumbered, General Sam Houston's Texas Republic Army and Steve Austin's Ranging Company are all that stand between Santa Anna's tyranny and independence.

You're so peaked; you look like death eating a cracker. General. Any word from the rangers? No, sir. I have an army of untrained, undisciplined, ill-equipped men and not enough of 'em. That's why I can't sleep. You got this wound 20-some odd years ago, and it still festers? Damn it. Huh? Yes. 1814... Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Musket ball. Caught a red stick arrow in the groin there too. Thanks to the Great Spirit, my manhood remained intact. [chuckles] Little chips of splintered bone still working their way out. I sent Bowie to Travis with an order to blow up the Alamo, abandon it. I can't imagine what a trial it must be to live with this. Sir, Baker and Sherman are still waiting to see you. Much obliged. "Here to be seen seeing me" is more like it. Delegation's arrived to say, "Attack the Mexicans." Houston : Huh, delegation! Well, by God, come in this instant, if not sooner. There's Juan Seguín too, sir. With due regard to the urgency of your call, gentlemen, I hope you don't mind me answering a call of my own. General, we mean no ill regard. We're just curious to what your plan is. I sent Deaf Smith and his rangering company to report on the Alamo situation. Until I hear back, it'd be damn stupid to fix on any plan. There's only one plan. Attack the Alamo. Mosley, I think you know me better than to address me like I'm some dumb son of a bitch. Sherman : I cannot imagine your intention is to abandon those men, sir. It's what Davy Crockett's promising to keep their spirits hopeful. Juan, how many men are we? Seguín : 374... by this morning's count. What are our supplies? Two days of beans, no meat, and we're certainly short of muskets, powder, and shot. Let me understand this. You think we ought to attack 5,000 well-armed, well-fed Mexican veterans supported by artillery. We do have the element of surprise, sir. Houston : Huh! It does not matter how many there are. They are only Mexicans. Juan! You're a fool, Mosley. I should let Seguín here cut your tongue out. General, what of Colonel Fannin's relief column? George, tell them the status on Colonel Fannin. Our courageous colonel was on his way to the Alamo when two wagons broke down betwixt and between. So he decided to change course and return to Goliad. That is all the more reason we need to reinforce Travis and Jim Bowie. Sam, what would your personal compunctions lead you to do? I will tell you what I'm not gonna do. I'm not gonna sacrifice what little army I have by charging pell-mell into Mexican lances. I will not fight Santa Anna the way he wants us to fight, nor the way you think I should. Gentlemen, Texas is struggling to break free from an oppressive regime. No. We must fight for our independence like George Washington and our forefathers fought for theirs... with speed and mobility. Fall back. Live to fight another day. Deaf Smith and his rangers have the right idea. As your commander, I will decide when the day is right to do more.

Ooh! [laughs] man : That's a whole heap nicer than I would've called her. I guess she rejected him. He felt compelled to leave her... by honor, Henry. Mm-hmm.

Now, nobody knows what happened between the two of them, but I do know that Sam Houston's never spoken a word against her, nor has he allowed one spoken in his presence. What does that tell you?

I remember once, Arredondo slaughtered over 1,000 of American pirates and wayward Tejanos, then left their corpses to rot in the field, unburied, for all to see and smell. We left all of Texas covered in tears and ashes as a warning to whoever again might raise their hand against Mexico. At the time, some of us young officers thought the general too ruthless, you know, too unnecessarily cruel. But we know now we were wrong. Arredondo was not harsh enough, and this is why we're fighting today... because he was not harsh enough. I will win this battle. I will win it for you. So 20 years from now, you will not have to lead your sons north to fight this war again, because Santa Anna, like Arredondo before him, was not man enough to win it once and for all.

Colonel Travis was killed by the Mexicans, along with everybody else at the Alamo. Crockett? He was gonna be U.S. president someday. Yes, sir. They got the whole damn lot of them. I'm on my way to fight alongside my brother at Fort Defiance in Goliad. Colonel Fannin's command? Reckon then I'll enlist there. Better ride with me, then, Hard Case.

Not sure I agree with your methods, General. Worked for Washington and Jackson. All right, men, stand beside me bearing arms. I promised you men an answer. I'm now prepared to deliver it. I've ordered Colonel Fannin to retreat from Goliad. Our armies will move east and join forces with his, picking up volunteers along the way. This is the very kind of deliberation that lost the lives of our compatriots at the Alamo! Sir, we lost great men in Travis and Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie himself. General, I feel it is our Christian duty to march to Goliad to fight. To defeat Santa Anna, to take our vengeance, and stand our ground with Fannin is the proper, tactically, thing to do, sir. man : He's right! We should fight! all : Yeah! Men... Houston : Colonel Fannin has his orders. You men have yours. You may question my military strategy but not my heart, and if any one of you question my command, there's a grave reserved for you.

Won't obey orders. Well, you want us to linger and spy on him? What do you reckon, Deaf? They're wearin' their own boots. Can walk where they want to.

I'm fine, damn it. Well, we... we just wanted to say that, well, we feel that it's the...

Now, you... do you understand what this is? Now, I told you... What's that commotion over there?

That's the private that deserted Gonzalez three days ago. Knowles : Let me just see. Let me just see. Here we go. What's that? We need to make an example. He'll do. Arrest him. We try him next halt. ♪ ♪ Hockley : Hear ye! Hear ye! This military tribunal is now in session. Prisoner that stands before this court is charged with desertion at the time of war. Private Ephraim Knowles, without orders or furlough, absented himself from Camp Gonzalez, which is a direct violation of his sworn military oath. No, no different from about 500 others. Private, do you have a friend or member of this company who you'd like to speak on your behalf? Well, let's see, Your Honor. I'd have to say the best man to speak for me would be none other than, uh, oh, me. [laughs] I'll tell you why. 'Cause my company ain't nothing but a bunch of sniveling b*st*rd weasels. [laughter] [gavel tapping] Order. Very well. Sergeant Anderson... Sir. Houston : I appoint you to speak on behalf of the accused. I don't know this man, sir. That may be to his advantage.

Sergeant, you are denying that he deserted? No. I'm the one that arrested him. Sherman : Sergeant, do you have anything to say on this man's behalf before he is sentenced? No, but I do have a few questions. Carry on. Private Knowles... Yes, sir. What were you doing before I arrested you? What was I doing? I was only just... I was arguing a teensy bit with some old widow woman. Anderson : That was the same woman that you helped across the river, with the children... That's right. And their pitiful few possessions. That's right. That's right. Alls I done is, I carried this fat old lady all the way across that damn river, and as soon as she was safe on the other side... Where did you say you were from again? Is it east Georgia? Milledgeville, Georgia. Get to the point, Sergeant. I heard a story about a man there who takes his pecker out in the store, wears no pants, walks around in the rain, stares at the sun all afternoon... That would be Obadiah Claymore. What of him? It's just that it's an area that's known for people marrying direct blood relations, so no more than 1 in 20 are born normal. Seguín : Señor Anderson, are you saying that Private Knowles is not responsible for his actions because he has... Yes, what I am saying is, is that there's a 1 in 20 chance that he's not right in the head. [laughter] Laugh it up. Laugh it up, and damn you all to hell. I am, too, right in the head. I am righter than right in my head. But I'll tell you what ain't right. I'll tell you what's goddamn insane, it's so far from right. It would be the idea of any one of us staying in this... this joke of an army to fight and fight and lose life after life... Sherman : Private, that's enough! For a goddamn lost cause. That's enough, Private. Knowles : A goddamn lost cause... I'm done defending. What was the prisoner's name again? Ephraim Knowles, sir. Ephraim? Yes, sir. Ephraim Knowles, for your cowardly desertion from this army in wartime, in accordance with military practice and precedent, this court hereby sentences you to death. Youse... You of all people... you call me a coward. You are the coward! You let the Alamo die, and now Fannin needs you. Ain't that the pot calling the kettle blacker than black. Oh! That'll do. Make your farewells and prepare your soul for eternity. At first light, you will be taken before the army firing squad, blindfolded, and shot. May God have mercy on you. Court's adjourned. Remove the prisoner. Now that the message has been sent, if he were to escape by morning, I wouldn't view it as a calamity. Yes, sir. Elwood : Get up. Houston : No. Eliza, no. Don't say that. Oh... No, no... [groaning] No! [haunting music] ♪ ♪ [thunder crashes] [match flares] I don't drink when I'm at war. It's medicinal. It helps me sleep. How long you been sitting there? Long enough. You gonna give me a stallion, or do I have to steal one? [scoffs and chuckles] Emily, Emily, Emily, now, how can I, in good conscience, allow you to put yourself in harm's way again? Why do you think I'd do such a thing? 'Cause you want revenge for your brother. What you care what I want? [thunder crashes] Are you still havin' that same nightmare? This isn't Basin Street. Persuasions received there are not welcome here. Persuasions? As I recall, what we did tween the sheets wasn't called "persuasions." The dream haunts me still. When we were together in New Orleans, I only had the nightmare one time. You ain't taking care of that wound. Doctors tell me it's unlikely it'll ever heal.
