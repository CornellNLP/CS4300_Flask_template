 Sam, what would your personal compunctions lead you to do? 
 Let Santa Anna get drunk on an abundance of confidence, and then we attack with a vengeance.

 Now, just... easy. 
 General Houston wants us to track down Santa Anna. 
 Come here. [crying] 
 As long as you don't get, you and your men are gonna be overrun and die.

 S.H.: could that stand for Samuel Houston? 
 Hmm? 
 This is the man you are running from? 
 He wasn't the man I thought he was.

 Sir, it now seems unlikely the Texans will prevail, especially since Houston's at odds with his officer corps. 
 Damned Texans. 
 Been at odds with them myself. 
 So Mister President, should we advise the Texans to relieve General Houston of Command? 
 As long as I've lived, I've been a keen judge of horse flesh. 
 What clenches it for me is just staring in the horse's eyes and letting him tell me who he is. 
 I first looked into Sam Houston's eyes at the Battle of Horseshoe. 
 He was 19 years old... first on the line, first on the assault, first to be marked for death. 
 I did not propose to understand him, but if there's a way to defeat Santa Anna, the only man capable of doing so is Sam Houston, except for me, of course. 
 All right there, Charmaine. 
 Good night, girl.

 Don't run from him no more. 
 Fight him like Comanches. 
 You stay close... so close he can feel your breath. 
 You let him know you're always there and he can't touch you. 
 Sooner or later, he's gonna show you his tender underbelly, and when he does, you take that sword of yours and you sink it to the hilt.
