 I tell you, it's a miracle drug. 
 It stops the blood. 
 Makes it thicker. 
 You thinking about becoming a doctor? 
 Why not? You're thinking about becoming a lawyer. 
 Will! Will, it's Conway! 
 Can I have my wig back? 
 If you wanted your wig, you shouldn't have thrown it away. 
 Oh, my God, Dors, you're preggers! 
 She's got vinegar tits! 
 What's that smell? 
 It's vinegar. I think it might be best if you took some time off. 
 I guess I was wrong about you. 
 You're just not up to it, are you? 
 Go home, Vera. 
 Take care of your mother. 
 There is a bad stash of gear coming into the prison. 
 It's called Pink Dragon. 
 Soon as it gets here I'll let you know. 
 You have an informer in your ranks. 
 You going to come for breakfast? 
 You know you can't stay in here forever. 
 They all think I'm still in the slot. 
 It doesn't look that bad. 
 It's not about looking bad, Bea. 
 It's about who I am. 
 In here. 
 But no-one wants to see me. 
 They just keep seeing this man. 
 Please, Bea. 
 Please just - just leave me. 
 Please. 
 Pick it up. 
 Huh? 
 Vinegar Tits. 
 Vera. Welcome back. 
 Thank you, Governor. I've spoken to the contractor and they'll pick up the garden skip this morning. 
 Good. And good work with Maxine Conway, by the way. 
 Thank you. 
 You took the right course of action. 
 Will that be all, Governor? 
 I need to see Smith. 
 Right away. 
 Vera? Condolences. 
 You've gotta help me. 
 Whoever's lagging's getting something for it. 
 You've gotta check it out. 
 What are you doing about this? 
 I'm working on it. 
 So what are you worried about? 
 Maybe Nash has forgotten about me. 
 He's getting out soon. 
 What if he doesn't contact me? 
 I won't be able to tell him about the baby. 
 Oh, no, he'll be in touch, love. 
 He will. 
 None of this would have happened if there hadn't have been drugs involved. What? 
 You know, I keep wondering why Fletcher came straight to H2. 
 I'm going up for seconds. 
 Tell me, Dors. 
 That garden was a pretty big privilege. 
 What'd Ferguson want in return? 
 You know if I have a problem with ya, I'll say it to your face. 
 I might not always like what you do, Franky, but I'm not a lagger. 
 We're family, yeah? I can't believe you'd even think that. 
 Smith. Governor wants to see you. 
 Hungry, huh? 
 Doreen? 
 Far out! 
 Don't sneak up on people, man! 
 You looked like you were going to throw up back there. 
 What do you want? 
 I know. 
 You know what? 
 It's not the first morning you've been sick. 
 And I've been around enough pregnant girls to know the signs. 
 Sh! 
 I won't tell anyone, don't worry. 
 You'd better not. 
 I just wanna help. If I can. 
 Why? 
 I love children. 
 Here, I have something for you. 
 It might help settle your tummy. 
 No, what happened to Simone Slater was entirely preventable. 
 And the only reason that Slater is not here today is because she had access to drugs. 
 And you and I both know where those drugs came from. 
 I'm not lagging. 
 I'm not asking you to do that. 
 Then what do you want? 
 You know, when all is said and done, a prison is controlled by two people. 
 Two people. 
 The Governor, and the inmate who has the respect of the other prisoners. 
 I am offering you my support to help manage the women of Wentworth. 
 It would be a chance to show that this prison is safe. 
 You're asking me to stand against Franky. 
 I want you to stand against drugs. 
 I mean, don't you think that would be a fitting way to honour the memory of your daughter? 
 We're trying very hard to organise proper housing, but I have to warn you that the waiting list is quite long. 
 Oh, well I mean this place is hardly the bloody Ritz, is it, you know. 
 Now Liz, have you thought any more about contacting your family? 
 I'd - I'd actually prefer to wait until I find my feet. 
 So look, once I'm settled somewhere decent, I will. 
 You know, one of the biggest mistakes that prisoners make when they're first released is to try and go it alone, to try and find their feet first. 
 I have to say, reintegration just doesn't work that way, especially for an alcoholic. 
 Yeah, but I've got all the AA meetings lined up. 
 And that's good. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 But we do all need help, Liz, and there is nothing more important than your children. 
 Yeah, well they're not children anymore, are they? 
 They're teenagers now. 
 That's exactly right. 
 And you have every legal right to contact them. 
 God, after seven years of silence? 
 I don't have any rights. 
 Wouldn't you want to see your Mum after seven years? 
 I don't, um, I don't actually know where they live. 
 This gives the Department of Corrections permission to source the contact details of your family. 
 Fill it in and we'll take it from there. 
 Ms Dawes said to me that I've got a natural affinity with the clay. 
 Alright then, I'll take it. 
 They could be worth a fortune one day. What about those? 
 Do you want those? 
 Hey, how'd it go with the parole officer? 
 Oh, you know, the usual. 
 Jobs, money, accommodation. 
 All the terrifying sh1t we come in here to avoid. 
 Franky's mood's making the thought of leaving a bit easier. 
 Hey, where is everyone? 
 Hey, in here. 
 This place is like a morgue, truth. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, you're packing up. 
 Yeah, I am. 
 Hey, can I take this? 
 Have you got a tea pot? 
 Nuh. Have you? 
 Nuh. 
 f*ck off the lot of you. 
 f*ck off. 
 You've gotta get Ferguson to tell you who it is. 
 Oh, yeah, just walk in and ask, you reckon? 
 Yeah, well why not? 
 Why don't you just deal with this? 
 Stop whining and find out who it is. 
 I'm doing all I can right now. 
 No more favours till you've cleaned your house. 
 Hey. Hi. I got something for you. 
 A nice wooded chardonnay? 
 Oh, I wish. 
 Until your hair grows back. 
 Was this a tea cosy? 
 Not anymore. 
 You serious? 
 Hey! 
 Oi. 
 Girls wanna know if you got anything for 'em. 
 Nuh. 
 Oh, f*ck, Franky! 
 Easy, it's coming. 
 Yeah, but when? 
 They're all freakin' out. 
 I said it's coming. 
 Be worth the wait. 
 Is it that pink stuff? 
 It's even better than that. 
 Hey listen, the deal's set. 
 I just need to iron out a few things before I can green light it. 
 Well, let me help. No, you tell the girls it's all good. 
 They're not gonna wait forever. 
 Hey! Hey, you alright? 
 Yeah, I just got somewhere I need to be. 
 You sure you're alright? 
 What the f*ck do you mean? 
 Franky, you know I'm here for you. 
 As a friend, if you need to talk. 
 You know you're meant to look happier after that. 
 Are you worried about the lagger? 
 The what? 
 What's the matter? 
 Who f*ckin' told you that? 
 Everybody knows about it. 
 Who's everyone? 
 The girls in C Block. And what else are the girls in C Block saying? 
 Nothing. Just - just- 
 What are they f*ckin' saying? 
 That you can't move any gear cos someone in your crew's lagging to Ferguson. 
 Oh, this f*ckin' place! 
 Franky, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Find 'em. 
 You reckon it's one of the girls from H2? 
 Course not. We're family. 
 Yeah, well without gear, everyone's gonna go crazy. 
 Yeah, I f*ckin' know already. 
 The girls- 
 I f*ckin' know that! 
 Franky- f*ck off. 
 I'm just trying to help you. 
 Franky. 
 f*ckin' go. 
 Franky- 
 f*ck off. f*ck off! 
 It says here on my application for a phone that they won't give me a phone unless I give them a phone number, which is a bit bloody hard cos I don't have a bloody phone. 
 You're gonna have to get a bloody phone. Yeah, bloody right! 
 How about you keep the f*ck down? 
 Don't even go there. 
 Hey, why don't you use one of your friend's phone numbers? 
 I don't even need a phone, do I? 
 I mean, all it's for is so your boss can hassle you, isn't it? 
 Liz. 
 They all want my address, right? 
 And I don't have an address. 
 And if you don't have an address you can't get a flat, and if you don't have a phone number you can't get a phone. 
 If you don't have a life you can't get a life. 
 Hey, hey, hey, it's gonna be OK. 
 What are you meant to do? 
 It'll be alright, Liz. No, it's not going to be alright, Dor. 
 Well Liz, your parole officer will help you out with all this stuff. 
 Yeah, but what about when she's not there? 
 And what if something goes wrong? 
 Hey Liz, just listen, OK? Before you were in here, you managed out there. 
 Phones, houses. 
 You can do it all again. 
 Yeah, but I wrecked everything last time. 
 I'm just gonna wreck it all again. 
 f*ckin' thing. 
 And it's positive. 
 Do we know who it belongs to? 
 No. 
 I've organised for testing of all inmates to begin immediately. 
 To maintain confidentiality I'll run it as a random drug test. 
 That's good. Excellent initiative. 
 We need to find the guilty parties, quickly and quietly. 
 Yes, Governor. 
 Vera, just- 
 Let's also keep the nature of these tests from the other officers for now, particularly the male ones. 
 Of course, Governor. 
 Only medical staff will know. 
 Vera. Remove that. 
 Hey, Mr Fletcher. 
 What do you want, Warner? 
 Visitors request form. 
 Seeing your lawyer? 
 Aha. 
 Mhmm. 
 You've got something there. 
 No, here. It's pen. 
 You've drawn all over yourself. 
 Attention compound, all prisoners in Cell Block G are to proceed to medical. 
 Doreen! 
 Hey. 
 Did you hear about the urine tests? 
 Yeah, happens all the time. 
 Aren't you worried? 
 Why? Won't they be able to tell you're pregnant? 
 f*ck, I need to get some clean piss. 
 You can have some of mine. I'm clean. 
 Alright, come on then. 
 Warner! 
 I'll see you when you're done, eh? 
 I need to speak with you. 
 Your, ah, new TV's here. 
 What? 
 Didn't you report your TV broken? 
 Yeah. 
 Then I guess that's your new one. 
 In this room, mate. 
 That looks pretty flash. 
 Whose is that? 
 Can you please give me some space? 
 No, get on with it. 
 I can't go while you're staring at me like that. 
 You will eventually. 
 Why are you picking on me? 
 I'm not a user. 
 I'm just about finished with G Block. 
 Should I call through for H now? 
 Can you just hold off on that call for one minute, Ms Atkins? 
 Yep. 
 I want you to test this one immediately. 
 You're a piece of work, aren't you, Warner? 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 This sweet, innocent act. 
 You're not fooling me. 
 Not for a minute. 
 I've done nothing wrong. 
 Ms Bennett. 
 Get back to your unit. 
 
 
 
 Come on. Come on. 
 No, I'm telling ya, Boomer said it's huge and a flat screen. 
 Who else has a flat screen around here, Franky? 
 Think about it. 
 She's gotta be the lagger, Franky. 
 Attention compound, prisoners from Cell Block H are to proceed to medical immediately. 
 Where have you been? 
 Here. 
 Oh, thanks so much. 
 You're a lifesaver. 
 Come on ladies, you heard the order. Down to medical. 
 Come on, fat cheeks! 
 You're exempt, Warner. 
 The rest of you, let's go. 
 Anderson, where are ya? 
 Yeah, right here. 
 Hurry up. 
 That's my tea cosy! 
 Sh! 
 Oh, that's, that's good. 
 Ms Miles. 
 Why is Jess Warner exempt from the test? 
 No idea. 
 Ms Miles? 
 I guess we have you to thank for this round of drug tests. 
 Is that the one full week after the last one? 
 So you Wentworth's new drug crusader, are you? 
 Do you disapprove of random drug tests? 
 Well it drives the women batshit and I could do without that crap again so soon. 
 Having random drug tests at regular intervals kinda defeats the purpose, wouldn't you say? 
 I know you're craving Ferguson's approval. 
 But sicking the SESG onto fellow officers, it smacks of desperation, that's not you. 
 Being vigilant is exactly me. 
 Vera, I know you've been through a lot lately. 
 But have a look at what Ferguson's doing to you. 
 What she's doing? 
 Mhmm. 
 For four years I have heard you go on like a broken record about how the women have it too easy, how we shouldn't show them sympathy and now you're upset about a drug test? 
 No, I'm upset about why you're acting this way. 
 Maybe you should be concerned about your own behaviour, Fletcher. 
 Look at yourself. You're a mess. 
 Stale alcohol on your breath. 
 That's bullshit. Come on. 
 Allowing female inmates to touch you inappropriately. 
 What? 
 You heard me. 
 The next time I see you, or any of my officers, having inappropriate physical contact with an inmate, it is not the SESG I'll be calling. 
 Smiles. Need more starch. 
 Alright, Anderson, come with me to the store room. 
 Hey Lindsay! 
 Sarah! What are you doing? 
 Get off me! 
 What are you doing? Get off me! 
 What have you been talking to the screws about? 
 What? Simple question. Why have you been talking to the screws? 
 I wasn't. f*ck off! I saw you talking to Bennett. 
 No, she wanted me to get her a drug test. 
 Put her in there. 
 She's a f*ckin' lagger. 
 Come on! 
 Tell me what you told Bennett. 
 She- 
 Tell me or you're dead. 
 Franky, look at her. 
 She's just a kid- 
 Stay the f*ck out of it! 
 Tell her! 
 You are losing control, my friend. 
 Why was she exempt from the drug test? 
 You want to catch the lagger, mate, you're gonna have to use your smarts. 
 You can't keep shoving people in a dryer. This is bullshit. 
 If I find out anyone, anyone's been talking to the screws, you're dead. 
 You getting nervous? 
 About what? 
 About getting out? 
 Nah. Shittin' myself. 
 You'll be fine this time. 
 You reckon? 
 Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 What's out there that's worse than this sh1t hole? 
 That's true. 
 I know something's up with you. 
 And it's not just gate fever. 
 You know you can still tell me sh1t, Liz. 
 No. 
 No, I'm just nervous, that's all. 
 Look, what happened that day with Jess, you've gotta understand- 
 No, no, Franky, don't. 
 Np, just listen, just listen. 
 You were right. 
 That wasn't smart, and I've gotta use my head. 
 Someone's lagging and Boomer just got a brick for it. 
 Yeah, well just stop dealing, Franky. 
 If you stop the drugs, mate- 
 You've forgotten what happens in this place when it runs dry? 
 Come on. 
 Yeah, but why does it have to be you? 
 Ah, f*ck. 
 You used to hate Jacs for what she did to the girls and now you're doing exactly the bloody same. 
 You know what? If it's not me, it'll be another Jacs, or worse. 
 Oh, worse than what happened to Jess in the laundry? 
 f*ck, where does this stuff come from? 
 It comes from caring, Franky. 
 I hate seeing you like this. 
 I hate what you've become. 
 You know what? 
 I've become what I had to. And I'm the one that's gotta live with it. 
 How about you, Liz? 
 You all comfortable in there, are ya? You're guilt f*ckin' free. 
 f*ck off. 
 f*ck, Franky. 
 Was it Warner? 
 I don't know. 
 Jesus! You have to ask Ferguson. 
 No f*ckin' way. 
 Hey, maybe you should remember if I go down, you do too. 
 Invoices, Governor. 
 Was there something else, Ms Miles? 
 Word out is Franky Doyle's looking for a lagger. 
 I just thought if there was someone, you might want to give them a heads up. 
 Do you really think that if I did have a source of information among the prisoners, I wouldn't give 'em a heads up? 
 No. 
 Anything else? 
 Have you finished the tests? 
 We finished taking samples, but not testing them. That'll take a while. 
 Next! 
 That's my job. 
 Sorry. 
 OK. 
 Hello, Mrs Novak. 
 Your INR is still too low, so we've upped your dose again. 
 I want you to take two of these red ones, OK? 
 OK, open up, Marge. Tongue out. 
 OK. To the left? 
 No, no, no, your tongue to the left. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Thank you Marge, you can go. 
 Pst! Hey! Did you get them? 
 Yes, a cinch. 
 It wouldn't take much to get it past those two love birds. 
 Who? 
 Mr Jackson and that slut. 
 Which one? 
 The nurse. 
 Really? 
 Really! 
 Here, give me the pills. 
 Don't you forget to take that one, alright? 
 I'm not completely mad, dear. 
 It's lovely! 
 Thank you. 
 This is your daughter's phone number. 
 Now you need to add it to your contact list, but it's been cleared by the department. And if you have any problems, you let me know. 
 It's a big first step, Liz. 
 But it's the right step. 
 Your chances of staying sober and making it on the outside, they go up massively if you have your family's support. 
 Governor, can I have a word please? 
 Do you really think you can bribe me? 
 Sorry? 
 The television. 
 You didn't request a new television? 
 Perhaps you're reading a little too much into it, hmm? 
 Oh, yeah, me and everyone else. 
 Doesn't exactly look good. 
 But I guess that's your plan, right? 
 How long did you allow your husband to beat you before you decided to make a stand? 
 If you don't want a new television, don't ask for one. 
 Let's go. 
 Hey, it's on. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 When? Tomorrow. It's coming in with the laundry. 
 Ferguson won't think to look there twice. 
 Yeah, I'll tell the girls. 
 Yeah. 
 OK. Now, one of the bags, it's got a mark on it, right? 
 I want you to spot it, push it off the conveyor and leave it on the floor underneath. 
 Right, Franky. Don't f*ck this up. 
 Nah, Franky. 
 OK, piss off. 
 Yes, Franky. 
 Alright, everyone, stop what you're doing now. 
 Mr Fletcher. 
 Move! 
 You lose something, Ms Ferguson? 
 Sense of humour, maybe? 
 Check everything. Tear the place apart if you have to. 
 Yes, Governor. 
 Mr Jackson. 
 Alright, everyone, up against the wall, please. 
 Up against the wall, please. 
 Now! 
 What do you want? 
 You f*ckin' lagged. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You should have done it right the first time. 
 What are you doing? No! No! 
 Hey, have you seen- 
 Piss off, Liz! 
 What the f*ck's going on here? 
 Get out! Bea! 
 Get the f*ck out of here, Liz. 
 f*ck off. 
 What are you doing this for? 
 Why are you doing it? 
 Why are you doing it? 
 What are you doing it for? 
 Because she told Ferguson. 
 Bullshit. She didn't tell Ferguson. 
 Franky. Franky! 
 Yes, she did. I set her up and she walked right into it. 
 It was me! 
 It's got nothing to do with you. 
 I heard you talking in the friggin' stairwell, Franky. It was me. 
 Right? It was me. 
 I did it. It was me. 
 Liz, what are you doing? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 You don't have to do this- 
 No, it's the truth and I can't stand watching anyone else cop the blame. 
 You c**t. 
 Get out. Get out. All of ya. 
 It's alright. It's alright. 
 Get out! 
 Why? 
 It was the pink stuff. 
 I couldn't stand watching you sell it, and I couldn't stand watching someone else die. 
 I don't give a sh1t about the f*ckin' drugs, Liz. 
 It's me. Me. 
 You lagged on me. 
 I thought we were family. 
 You're a pain in the arse but you gave a sh1t about me. 
 I'd never had that before. 
 Ever. 
 I trusted you. 
 f*ck, Franky- 
 Nuh. 
 Don't touch me, don't talk to me. 
 Just leave me alone. 
 If you ever come back to Wentworth, I will kill you myself. 
 I want to go into protection. 
 Have there been repercussions? 
 No. No, it's not that. 
 I just wanna go. 
 Well, I'm certainly not going to stop you. 
 Have you managed to speak with your family, to make arrangements for your release? 
 No, I tried. 
 The phone queues were too long. 
 Well, one good turn deserves another. 
 Sorry? 
 It's your daughter's mobile number. 
 I'll give you some privacy. 
 We finished the pregnancy tests, Governor. 
 And? 
 All negative. 
 Has there been a mistake, do you think? 
 I think we've been had. 
 Twenty years in this job and I'm still amazed at the ingenuity of prisoners. 
 I'd like to run a second test on the samples at the lab. 
 We might as well do a drug screen, having gone to the trouble of collecting a prison-wide sample. 
 Very well. 
 Just wait one moment, please. 
 Yeah, I know, love, I know, but- 
 OK, I've gotta go, so I'll speak to you soon. 
 Yep. 
 Everything alright? 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Ms Bennett? Please escort Ms Birdsworth to Protection and see her belongings are sent over. 
 Yes, Governor. Birdsworth. 
 At the third stroke, it will be six- 
 Why would she do it? 
 I should never have told her about the Pink Dragon. 
 No, it's not your fault. 
 Liz did what she had to do. 
 What's gonna happen now she's gone, eh? 
 I'm afraid about Franky and what she'll do. 
 Well, how will we stop her? 
 You can't. 
 Cos you'll just end up dead or in hospital. 
 What is it? 
 Um, nothing. Never mind. 
 You know, from the very first day I've been in here, everyone thought that I wanted something. 
 To be in charge. Power. 
 So, they bashed me and manipulated me. They pushed me around and they killed my daughter, and I don't know why. 
 I never asked for anything. 
 But maybe it's time I did. 
 So, if they're going to keep pushing me, then I think it's time I pushed right back. 
 Good to go? 
 What the hell is this? 
 It's your helmet. 
 That's huge. 
 Well that's for your huge head. 
 Ah, I mean your huge bun. 
 My what? 
 I don't wanna ruin the bun.
