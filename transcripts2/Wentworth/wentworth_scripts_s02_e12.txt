 I love you to the moon and back. 
 I love you too. 
 I found her. 
 Where? Where's my little girl? 
 They told me at the hospital to go home. 
 There's nothing more I could do. 
 I want payback for Debbie, Brayden Holt. 
 I'm gonna kill the fucker. 
 This is for Debbie. 
 You f*cking monster! 
 He did do it, not that it could be proven in a court of law. 
 You know, you're not who you think you are. 
 Your true nature will eventually come out. 
 What are you doing? 
 You can't restrain slashed wrists. 
 Oh, it's a miracle pill. 
 So, the drugs stop the bleeding? 
 I understand you, Smith. 
 You're a loner. 
 But it doesn't pay to be a loner in here. 
 Look, I've got something coming to you this afternoon. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 It's Bea's! She won. 
 Are you with Smith? 
 No, I'm just outside the ward. 
 Get back to her, now. 
 Those injuries were self-inflicted. 
 sh1t. 
 Where is she? 
 I'm sorry. 
 What you up to, mate? 
 Yeah, what you doing? 
 What's the situation? 
 I'm waiting to give a statement. 
 Look, we've turned this hospital upside down. 
 She's not here. 
 Well, of course she's not there. 
 Smith escaped on your watch, so you'd better find her. 
 Well, how am I supposed to do that? 
 That's your problem. But don't show your face till it's done. 
 She didn't plan this alone. 
 She had help. 
 Does it look like I was helping? 
 You wanted her gone. 
 Yeah, I'm glad to see the back of the bitch but I didn't help her. 
 You're lying. 
 I'm not, I swear. 
 Who helped her? 
 I don't know. 
 How long has she been planning it? 
 Well, you're closer to her than I am. 
 Where's she headed? 
 I don't know. 
 Get out! Get out of my office! Now! 
 The last thing she deserves is your loyalty. 
 You were nothing to her. 
 You were a joke. 
 She humiliated you in front of all those women. 
 It wasn't a fair fight. 
 She used you and you played right into her hands. 
 Snap. 
 Phone records. 
 Get out. 
 I've checked the audio files. 
 Smith sent Birdsworth a package. 
 He must know something. 
 Well, get me the recordings. 
 And check if anything's turned up on CCTV. 
 Ferguson's losing it. 
 You picked a good time to get out. 
 I bet Walford's gonna be a breeze after this place. 
 Hey, um, thought we'd all head down the local for a few drinks tonight. 
 Give you a proper send off. 
 Yeah, as long as Ferguson's not invited. 
 Mr Fletcher, Governor wants to see you. 
 Well as of 10 minutes ago, I don't work for her anymore. 
 It's important. 
 Well if it's a cake, you can tell her I'm not interested. 
 I've just finished a double shift, Vera. 
 I don't need this crap. 
 Well, I don't know how she got it. 
 Don't believe you. Try again. 
 I found it on the floor. 
 I thought I'd dropped it. 
 The swipe card was attached to your belt. How did she get it off? 
 The cord was broken. 
 I thought I'd snagged it but she must have cut it somehow. 
 You are even more stupid than I thought. 
 I'm sure the police will be very interested to hear about this. 
 Listen, I had nothing to do with her escape, alright? 
 I cannot believe a word you say, Mr Fletcher. 
 I didn't help her. 
 Vera. 
 You know I didn't do it. 
 I will be launching an official investigation. 
 And I will be giving your new Governor a full appraisal of your utter incompetence and with any luck that will be the end of your career in Corrections. 
 Now, get out of my prison. 
 Mr Fletcher might have been incompetent, but he wouldn't have been involved in an escape. 
 Just make sure he returns all our property before leaving the building. 
 She's awesome, man. I bet she's like been planning it for ages. 
 Nuh. Franky would have known about it, alright? 
 Nah, Bea's too smart. 
 She would have kept it quiet, eh. 
 Hey? 
 Red's a f*cking coward, Sky. 
 That's why she ran. 
 Oh, but she kinda beat ya, eh Franky? 
 If she beat me, Sky, where the f*ck is she? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I want you to get a crew together and teach Maxine a lesson. 
 Well... 
 What the f*ck's that about? 
 Just f*ckin' do it. 
 Yeah, it's not gonna happen. 
 Oh, Franks, sorry. 
 They're, they're not gonna do it. 
 Sorry. 
 You let me worry about the prison, Mr Channing. 
 And you can make sure the Department doesn't interfere. 
 I appreciate your help, as always. 
 Franky? 
 You OK? 
 Things will be back to normal soon. 
 What's normal in this place? 
 Do you think Bea will get caught? 
 I don't wanna f*cking hear about her anymore. 
 Right? 
 Hey, wait up. 
 Don't go, come back. 
 f*ck all of 'em out there. 
 f*ck Red. I still got you. 
 Kimmy. 
 Franks. 
 There's something I've gotta tell you. 
 I'm getting out. 
 My parole's been approved. 
 Are you happy for me? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 You can go back to your nice life and your nice family. 
 Good for you. 
 Hey, you'll be up for parole soon too, and... 
 Then what? 
 You and me? 
 Yeah. 
 You're a gate gay, for f*ck's sake. 
 Just go back to your boyfriend. 
 You got what you needed from me, so f*ck off. 
 You know, maybe if it wasn't all about you all of the time, you'd see that I've always been here. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, I'll get a place. 
 When you get out, you'll have somewhere to go. 
 I don't make plans, cos they always f*ck up. 
 Ah, handcuffs, capsicum spray, keys. 
 I just need your staff ID and swipe card. 
 OK, that's everything. 
 Just sign there, please. 
 Yep, we're done. 
 So that's it? 
 Yes. 
 I don't get a proper goodbye? 
 You know the way out. 
 What happened to the old Vera? 
 I really liked her. 
 I didn't. 
 See ya, Fletch. 
 Catch you tonight for a farewell bevvie. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Hey, where you taking her? 
 Transfer to Barnhurst. 
 Why? 
 Cos that's what the paperwork says. 
 Mate, this isn't a taxi, alright? 
 Just drive, OK? Let's go. 
 That sh1t'll kill ya. 
 f*ck! Bea. 
 Come on, let's get inside. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 Police been here? 
 No. 
 How the hell did you get out? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Now did you get that package? 
 You're going after Brayden. 
 You opened it. 
 How could you drag me into this? 
 I'm on parole! 
 If anyone finds out I've helped - 
 They won't find out because you're not going to tell them. 
 Have you actually thought it through, Bea? Mate, it's suicide. 
 Liz, where's the gun? 
 I got rid of it. 
 Bullshit. 
 Bea! 
 You don't even know how to use it! 
 You're a hairdresser, for God's sake. Think about what you're doing. 
 Bea, please. Oh, love. 
 Bea! 
 I'm begging you. Don't do this. 
 Please. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, Bea. 
 Oh, no. No, Bea. 
 Please, wait. Bea! 
 sh1t, it's the cops. 
 No, no, no, that one. That one. 
 What the f*ck! 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 Bitch, get out of here! 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was never here, alright? 
 Alright? 
 Yeah. 
 Liz Birdsworth? This is the police. 
 Can I help you? 
 So, she's not made any contact with you this morning? 
 I can't believe she's out. 
 Answer the question. 
 No. I, I haven't heard from her. 
 Well, she asked you to receive a package. Where is it? 
 Sorry? 
 The package. 
 Oh, we've got a recording of your phone conversation. 
 Oh, yeah. No, she just wanted to send me some magazines. 
 There's no way she'd come here. 
 She's too smart for that. 
 Any idea where she might go? 
 No. 
 What's this? 
 Oh, that's a steak knife, love. 
 What's it doing here? 
 Waiting for a steak. 
 Gimme five, will ya? 
 Now, you need to tell me what you know about Ferguson. 
 I've got contacts at Barnhurst. I'll make sure you're protected, Kelly - 
 Yeah, she's got contacts too. 
 What'd she do to you, Kelly? 
 You need to cut the bullshit and start talking, alright? 
 You need to tell me what she f*ckin' did to you! 
 f*cking look at me! 
 Your eye. 
 Well done, Sherlock. 
 Why did she do it? 
 To keep me quiet. 
 About what? 
 I caught her with Jianna. 
 Who's Jianna? 
 A prisoner at Blackmoore. 
 Ferguson had the hots for her. 
 I caught 'em doing stuff. 
 They were having a relationship? 
 Are you sure? 
 I saw 'em. 
 Did anyone else know about this? 
 Yeah, a few of us. 
 When Jianna's bub got taken Ferguson lost it. 
 She took it out on us. 
 Who took the baby? 
 A social worker. 
 Then what happened? 
 Did Jianna kill herself? 
 How do you know that? 
 Cos I've heard this story before. 
 Any word yet? 
 No, but police are questioning Birdsworth. 
 Apparently she was receiving a package for Bea Smith. 
 She won't tell the cops anything. 
 Look, can you give me the address to the halfway house? 
 Wait, hold on. 
 What's that address again? 
 Everything's messed up. 
 Bea's gone and Nash has disappeared. 
 Oh, he'll come see you soon, love. 
 He's been out for four days. 
 But there's lots to do. 
 His first few days outside? 
 Stop being selfish. 
 I don't wanna do this on my own. 
 I want my baby to have a family, you know? 
 You're not alone. You've got me. 
 I love kids. 
 I'll support you, no matter what happens. 
 You don't need Nash. 
 Whoops! 
 You alright, Franks? 
 Yeah, I'm sweet. 
 Get that cleaned up. Quickly. 
 I want Doyle brought up to see me. 
 Now. 
 How was lunch? 
 Nice move back there. 
 What'd you bribe her with? 
 No idea what you mean. 
 Still, you have good reason to be paranoid. 
 That pack can smell blood. 
 It's a shame you didn't accept my original offer, isn't it? 
 A shame for who? 
 Whom. 
 Lucky for you, I am a generous person. 
 I am willing to make you a deal. 
 You side with me and I will stamp out any contenders. 
 Keep you at the top. 
 Let's cut the bullshit and call this for what it is. 
 You backed a loser and now you need my help. 
 As you need mine, if you want to stay safe. 
 I mean, that is what you want, isn't it Franky? 
 The little abused girl just wants to stay safe. 
 Let me know what you decide. 
 I told you, it hasn't been approved yet. 
 Well, how come? 
 Linda. Can I borrow your card? 
 What? 
 She's gonna want to see me. 
 That's now how it works, you know that. 
 You need to be approved. 
 Linda, I left my phone in the locker. 
 Just let me borrow your card. 
 I can't do that. 
 Just ask her? 
 Linda, give me your card. 
 I'll be one minute. Let's go. 
 I'm not gonna leave until I see her. 
 That's not how it works, alright? 
 Put in a request, and it'll be processed. 
 Well how long's that gonna take? 
 It'll take as long as it takes. 
 That's not an answer. 
 Come back next week. 
 Are you joking? 
 Would you like me to escort you from the premises, or would you like to leave on your own? Because I've had enough. 
 And the police have interviewed Birdsworth, but they haven't gotten anywhere yet. 
 Mr Fletcher. 
 Get out. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 Get out. This is private. 
 Believe me, Governor, you don't want anyone to hear this. 
 I'll handle this. 
 This is f*cked up, even for you. 
 Here I was, thinking you had it in just for me. 
 But it was Will, too, wasn't it? 
 In fact, it's pretty much always been about Will. 
 You are clearly unstable, Mr Fletcher - 
 I'm unstable? That is f*cking rich! 
 Please, take a seat - 
 You had someone break in and take my journal. 
 You had Will's place turned over. 
 The text messages, death threats. 
 All part of some sick vendetta because he took that baby away. 
 Yeah, I know about Jianna. 
 And what you did to those prisoners. 
 You're not a Governor, you're a f*ckin' psychopath. 
 You really think so? 
 I know it. 
 Then I'd carefully consider your next move, if I were you. 
 You traumatised Bryant to try and shut her up. 
 But she's my witness now. 
 I'm going straight to the department with this. 
 I'm gonna bring you down. 
 That is just ludicrous. 
 It's true. She's playing you. 
 She's playing all of us. 
 She tortured an inmate into silence, for f*ck's sakes! 
 You need to understand that Ferguson is not right in the head. 
 I've heard enough. 
 You haven't heard anything yet. 
 Yes, I have. 
 A prisoner used your swipe pass just hours before she escapes and when the Governor questions you about it, you suddenly come up with some ridiculous story. 
 Listen, I have an eyewitness. 
 Yeah? Well we have CCTV. You will be lucky if you are not charged. 
 That is chicken sh1t compared to what Ferguson has done. 
 The prisoner I spoke to said there was a social worker - 
 Stop. 
 Listen, I - 
 No, enough! 
 Please escort Mr Fletcher from the premises. 
 I know the way, Gary. 
 
 
 
 Doreen! 
 Do you think they'll catch her? 
 Dunno. 
 Depends where she goes, I guess. 
 Doreen! 
 If I was her, I'd cut all my hair off, change my image. 
 Go somewhere and start all over. 
 Doreen! 
 Did you hear that? 
 What? 
 I don't know. 
 I thought I heard someone. 
 Doreen! 
 Doreen! 
 It's Nash. Nash? Nash! 
 Nash, I can hear you! 
 Oi, babe! 
 They won't let me in! 
 I haven't been approved yet! 
 What? 
 I haven't been approved yet! 
 I'll come back next week eh, babe? 
 I miss ya! 
 I miss you too. 
 I'm pregnant! 
 Nash? 
 What? 
 I'm pregnant! 
 I f*ckin' love you, Doreen! 
 Attention, compound. 
 Exercise period is over. 
 All prisoners return to your work stations. 
 Babe, I'll be back next week, alright? 
 Just rest up. 
 Babe, drink heaps of milk, alright? 
 I gotta go! 
 Governor? 
 Mr Fletcher's gone. 
 Everything OK? 
 He was saying some pretty crazy things about your time at Blackmoore. 
 That's not true though, is it? 
 What if it is? 
 Every decision I make is for the greater good. 
 If I have to make difficult choices, then so be it. 
 You could relate to that. 
 I'm sorry? 
 What you did to your mother. 
 I understand. 
 It was a necessity. It was right. 
 Some people would think differently, but you made a difficult decision for the greater good. 
 Just like me. 
 My conscience is clear. How's yours? 
 ...to be involved in? 
 Initially, we started out about 47 metres of trim. 
 No, it was about 50. 
 50 meters. And every time we extended a room, there was an extra meter here, an extra meter there... 
 Still talking about me? 
 Um, oh, I brought you something to eat. 
 It's not much - 
 Just tell me. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, they're talking. 
 And what're they saying? 
 Cindy Liu, you know from C Block? 
 Mm. 
 She wants a crack at top dog. 
 She's gettin' a crew together. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Well, someone's made me an offer. 
 So I might just have to take it. 
 What can I get you, love? 
 Ah, a gin and tonic, please. 
 Double. 
 Yep. Ooh, you're two bucks short. 
 Oh, just make it a single, then. 
 Nah. 
 Don't tell the boss, OK? 
 I need you to tell Mr Channing to call me and I need to see him today. 
 It's urgent. 
 Thanks. 
 Pleasure. 
 You've reached Will Jackson. 
 Please leave a message. 
 It's Fletch. 
 I need you to call me, mate, ASAP. 
 I'm going to head over to your place. 
 If you get this message, call me back. 
 Mr Jackson. 
 Where's Bea? 
 The bloke at the halfway house just sold you out for $20. 
 If you really want to help her, tell me where she is. 
 Birdsworth told me everything. 
 I'm on my way to get Bea now. 
 She's armed. 
 She might do something stupid. 
 Where is she? 
 You wanted me to handle this, so that's what I'm doing. 
 I won't say a word, just tell me where she is. 
 She's heading for the airport. 
 Gotta go. 
 Birdsworth lied to you. Bea Smith is heading for the airport. Right now. 
 I'll alert security. 
 Detective, you should know that Officer Jackson's on his way to meet her. 
 It seems he was complicit in her escape. 
 What makes you think that? 
 His harassment of Bea Smith's husband is well documented, as are Harry Smith's accusations against him. 
 It is apparent Officer Jackson and Bea Smith are involved. 
 Isn't that right, Vera? 
 Absolutely. 
 It's obvious they're running away together. 
 Well, they're not going to get on a plane. 
 They're armed and dangerous. 
 So are we. 
 This is so nice. 
 It's one of Mum's. 
 Dad gave me her old records. 
 Don't f*cking move. 
 What's going on? 
 Carly, shut up. 
 Brayden, she's got a gun. 
 Get out. 
 Brayden, what's going on - 
 Just get out now. 
 Go. 
 Please, don't do this - 
 Just get down on your knees. 
 Do you want money? 
 I can get you money - 
 No, I don't want your f*ckin' money. 
 Just get down on your knees. 
 Please, I can - 
 Shh, shh! 
 Right? Everything's OK. 
 I just want to talk, alright? Alright? 
 Alright. 
 See, I want to know why you killed my daughter. 
 Please, just let - 
 No, you just answer the question! 
 Tell me why you did it. 
 I never wanted to hurt Debbie. 
 You have to believe me. 
 She wanted it. 
 What, she wanted to die? 
 She wanted to forget. 
 She loved you. 
 She, she hated being away from you. 
 When she was out of it, it didn't matter. 
 This is bullshit. Bullshit! 
 No, no, no! 
 No! 
 You are going to tell me why you did it. 
 Mum made me do it. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 No, you had a choice. 
 She's the reason Debbie's dead, not me. 
 Don't try and weasel out of it! 
 I only did what I was told. 
 Yeah, well why didn't you say no? 
 Why didn't you say no? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 You put the f*cking needle in her arm, and you don't know? 
 I'm f*cked, you know? 
 It's cos I'm f*cked. 
 Please, if I could go back I wouldn't have done it. 
 I wish none of it happened. 
 Stop. Stop crying! 
 Please. Please. 
 Stop crying. 
 I loved Debbie. 
 Shut the f*ck up! 
 Alright. 
 Is that the sh1t you gave Deb? 
 Is it? 
 Yes. 
 Alright, you're gonna put it in your arm, OK? 
 You're gonna mix it up and you're gonna put it in your arm, cos I want you to know what it felt like for her. 
 Please - 
 Do it or I'll blow your f*cking head off. 
 Hurry up. 
 Use more. All of it. 
 Come on, just stop talking and do it. 
 Please, I can't. I can't. 
 Do it or I will shoot you. 
 Please. 
 You're gonna have to shoot me. 
 I will. 
 I'll do it. 
 Jesus, Bea. 
 Bea. 
 Don't do it. Put it down. 
 Put it down. 
 Come on. Now you pull that trigger and you'll be inside for the rest of your life. 
 Do you want that? 
 Go away. 
 Is that what you want? 
 Go! 
 Don't do it, Bea. Put it down. 
 Debbie wouldn't want this. 
 She'd stop you. You know that. 
 Please, Bea. Not with a gun. 
 Bea, this isn't you. 
 Come on. Drop the gun, please? 
 This isn't you, Bea. 
 I want you to let Brayden walk out of here, OK? 
 Come on, Bea. 
 Good. Good. 
 Brayden. 
 Get up slowly and walk out. 
 What the f*ck. 
 Quickly. 
 The media, I want the area cordoned off. 
 OK. 
 The cops are here. 
 Let's go downstairs. Bea? 
 Bea? 
 Stand up. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Will, it's me again. Listen, you need to pick up your phone, mate, OK? I'm just leaving your place. I need to talk to you. 
 It's important. 
 Move back. 
 Lockdown? 
 Yeah, we got blokes 'round the back just in case. 
 This is the police! 
 Come out slowly with your hands up. 
 Put your hands up! Gun! Gun! Gun! 
 Put the gun down and get down on the ground. 
 It's OK, it's OK. 
 Just do what they say. 
 Both of you! Down on the ground. 
 Look, I'm Will Jackson. I'm a Corrections officer. 
 Get on your stomachs now! 
 I'm a Corrections officer from Wentworth. 
 Hands behind your heads. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Go! 
 What the f*ck! Get off me! 
 Let go of me, OK? 
 I was trying to help you. 
 Bea Smith, you are under arrest for escaping. 
 Will Jackson, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting an escaped criminal. 
 Just let me explain, OK? 
 Take him away and caution him. 
 Secure the premises, find Brayden Holt. 
 Sir, we've found Brayden Holt. 
 Earlier today, at the scene of a fatal shooting at a Clayton panel beating workshop, where escaped fugitive, Bea Smith, has just been taken into custody by police. 
 The deceased is believed to be business owner, Brayden Holt. 
 Son of former crime matriarch, Jacs Holt, and underworld figure, Vinnie Holt. 
 An unnamed Corrections officer was also arrested at the scene. 
 Why's Mr Jackson being arrested? 
 ..the escaped prisoner, Bea Smith, escaped custody from a Melbourne hospital yesterday evening where she was being treated following an incident at Wentworth Prison. 
 It's now believed she used the incident to inflict savage wounds on herself in order to stage the daring escape. 
 Tonight, Bea Smith is to be returned to Wentworth Correctional Centre. 
 In other news the 2:00am lockout... 
 Shout me a drink first? 
 Maybe not. 
 Alright. 
 I'll take the prisoner to Isolation. 
 No. Process her and put her back in H2. 
 I'm sure Franky'll be pleased to see her. 
 Freak. 
 You know the routine. 
 Welcome back. 
 This is Queen Bea. 
 She's the top dog now. 
 Anyone got a problem with that? 
 They're all yours.
