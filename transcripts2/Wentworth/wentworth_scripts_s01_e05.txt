 We can finally get on with our lives. 
 Who is she? 
 She works for my lawyer, her name's Cass. 
 She's nothing. 
 I've got to know who did that to Mick. 
 You can't do this by yourself. 
 You need to get some help. 
 Give me another scotch, please. 
 Oh, my God! 
 She's supposed to sh1t it out. 
 sh1t what out? 
 Heroin? 
 Yes. 
 Franky, I'd like you to speak today at the Our Journey event. 
 You haven't said the magic word. 
 Then there's Miss Davidson. She believed in me. 
 She saw past the front and she saw who I was. 
 It helped that she was hot. She's given me a hunger... to be a better person. 
 You're up next, Liz. 
 Our final speaker for today, our peer worker, Elizabeth Birdsworth. 
 Who me? 
 Is she pissed? 
 She hasn't had booze in ages. 
 Some of the women in here, they stick drugs up their kids' bum. 
 Right, get her out. 
 No, no, no! 
 And the little kids, they OD, right, and she nearly died. 
 Tell me what you want me to do. 
 Morning. 
 I hope that dream was about me. 
 Erica, hi. Not now, Hayley, I've got a lot to do. 
 Just a quick update on Meg Jackson's murder investigation. 
 You know to go through the proper channels. 
 Our PR people are the ones issuing statements. 
 What about the Our Journey event? 
 The incident with the prisoner. 
 The little girl who OD'd in the visitors' centre. 
 Any truth that the Department's losing faith in you? 
 The promises on reform, you haven't delivered on them. 
 I'm sorry, don't you have anything better to do than to stand around here and look for someone to harass? 
 Hold it. 
 Perhaps we struck a nerve. 
 Stay calm. They want you to bite back, it gives them a story. 
 They have a story, thanks to Liz. 
 At least we got something positive out of it. 
 The Department put this out. 
 Took the curse off the day for the Minister. Somewhat. 
 There's plenty of women who are interested in furthering their education. 
 Can they hold their own in a public forum? 
 No, they would probably cave under the pressure. 
 We can't afford to have a repeat of what happened to the peer worker. 
 Morning, sir. She's not the peer worker any more. 
 We need someone who the public can respond to in a positive way. 
 Someone with a profile. 
 Franky? 
 Franky. When is she due for parole? 
 Two years. 
 That gives us time. All right, get her in for a chat. 
 Thought maybe you had a plan. 
 I'll just add it to the list. 
 Move it to the top. 
 Morning, Liz. Not a very pleasant way to start the day. 
 Oh, it could have been worse, it could have been poo. 
 That's true. 
 No way. 
 f*cking run out. 
 Poor thing. Feel sorry for her having to do that. 
 Well, she asked for it. It's her job now. 
 Hold up. 
 Hey! I thought I'd get some feedback by now. 
 It was tight, wasn't it? 
 Everyone enjoyed your speech. 
 Were you satisfied? 
 You impressed the hierarchy. 
 In fact, they want you mentored. 
 On, that sounds interesting. 
 We can talk about it later. I'll get someone to escort you to my office. 
 Casual or formal? 
 So I know what to wear. 
 Hey, Dor! Dor! 
 Hey, when are you going to start talking to me? 
 When you apologise for wrecking the event. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, you're not. 
 Eh? 
 It is kind of funny. 
 Doreen Anderson, Governor. 
 Hi, Doreen. 
 You're not in trouble, take a seat. 
 You did really well at the Our Journey event, everyone was impressed. 
 Thanks. 
 You were articulate, you were confident, you had the respect of the women. 
 You've come a long way. I used to be scared about getting up in front of people. 
 I know, and now we need more women like you. 
 Women who want to better themselves. 
 You've set a really good example. 
 Ta. 
 Which is why I want you to be the new peer worker. 
 But that's Liz's job. 
 Well, Liz can't be trusted any more. 
 I'd give you training, I wouldn't just throw you in. 
 There's plenty of other women that would be better like... 
 Brook, she's smart. Or Justine. I mean, the women really like her. 
 I've considered others but I think you're the woman for the job. 
 I'd just do it for a little while till Liz got it back? 
 No, if all goes well, this would be a permanent thing until your release. 
 I can't. 
 I'd be stabbing Liz in the back. 
 Well, Liz let you down, Doreen. 
 Liz let everyone down. 
 She doesn't deserve your loyalty. 
 She loves that job. 
 And I understand. 
 But I'm sorry, there's going to be a new peer worker whether it's you or not. 
 ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Hey! What did she want? 
 Nothing, she just asked me about the home brewing stuff. 
 Oh, sh1t, am I in trouble? 
 I thought they found that. 
 Yeah, they did. 
 So what did she want? 
 Look, I just told you. I've had enough questions this morning. 
 Oh, you've got the painters in, mate? 
 Come on, get back to work. 
 Higher, higher! 
 Get out of it! 
 Want me to do something? 
 No, it's fine. 
 Get out of it. 
 Get back to work. 
 If that's the best you can do, I'm disappointed. 
 You're losing it, Francesca. Too busy sucking up to the Governor. 
 Could you get Cass to give me a call? 
 I could do with a blonde. 
 Hey, what's wrong with brunettes? 
 Keep your disgusting s*x life to yourself. 
 Hey, do you think Cass's hair is really blonde, though? 
 It looks real. It doesn't have that black thing down the middle when the regrowth starts. Hello. 
 Just shut up, Liz! 
 Oh, she talks. Doreen! 
 Come back, talk to me! Doreen! 
 Doreen! Doreen! 
 That was a piss-poor effort. 
 You are obviously writing yourself off again. 
 You have no bloody idea, Fletch. 
 It's not getting you any closer to finding out who killed your wife. 
 What do you reckon Meg'd say if she saw you like this? 
 Get your head straight, Will. 
 Get your sh1t sorted and think about what you're doing. You're a joke. 
 Argh! 
 So the Department think you have real potential and want to help you make the most of it. 
 So you need to decide upon some career options. 
 Focus your study accordingly. 
 Accordingly. 
 What? 
 Oh, you went formal. 
 It's disappointing. I thought our relationship had moved past that. 
 I think you should take this seriously. 
 I think it's a good offer. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I'll do it. 
 Great. 
 As long as you're my tutor. 
 No, that's not possible. 
 You helped me get my HSC. 
 No, I didn't. 
 I didn't sit the exams for you, Franky. 
 You know how to motivate me. I don't force you to better yourself. 
 We work well together. 
 I just don't have time to tutor you any more. 
 I'll work hard, I'll make you look good. No, I can't. 
 Yeah, you can. 
 Medical's running a bit behind today. 
 You know I had a urine test two days ago. 
 It's just random. It's nothing to worry about if you're not using. 
 I saw Liz earlier. She's looking a bit of a mess. 
 Yeah, well, she lost parole. 
 'GO1 calling CO3, new arrivals in 20.' 
 Yeah, CO3, copy that. 
 I'll go get the nurse. 
 Stop picking your nose, it's gross. 
 Eh, you look like you've been caught with your pants down. 
 What have you done? I just saw Mr Jackson without his top on. 
 Bloody hell, wish I'd been there. 
 He caught me staring at him. 
 It'll give you something to think about late at night, under the covers. 
 We all know what gets you off, Liz. 
 Oh, do you, Doreen? Yeah. 
 Got to do a bit of self service. 
 And if you wonder what the moaning is that's Boomer and her Fevola poster. 
 Aw! 
 Makes me come like a werewolf. 
 Aw, too much information. 
 Oi, Franks! 
 What? 
 We know what gets you off. 
 A girl's got to have her secrets, mate. 
 Hey, Bea, don't you pretend you don't do it. 
 Yeah, you must have flicked yourself off. 
 Come on, guys, leave her alone. 
 Have you? Have you? My s*x life is none of your business. 
 Oh, my God, she hasn't. 
 What, never? 
 Bloody hell. Are you serious? Eh? 
 That's why you're so uptight all the frigging time. f*ck you, Liz. 
 Ooh, eh, she's never said f*ck before, to me. 
 Why don't you have a bit of a go, darling? Go on. 
 It'll make you feel nice and relaxed. 
 Liz - 
 Oh, Doreen, I am having fun. 
 It's not funny, it's just mean. 
 It's just the piss talking. Well, I f*cking like the booze talking. 
 Shut up. 
 Hey, what happened to your shoulder? 
 Strained rotator cuff. 
 That sounds painful. 
 It's fine. 
 Where's he going to eat that, the car park? 
 What's going on between you two? 
 OK, fine, happy to stay out of it. 
 Coming out tonight? 
 Trivia at the local. Didn't Chris tell you? No. 
 Are you going, Vera? 
 No, Adam's taking me out. 
 It's a show, I think, in the city. 
 He wanted to surprise me. I think I'll give it a miss, too. 
 I'm not in the mood. You get in the mood once you're out. That's the point Come on, Fletch, you know you want to. 
 Scared I'll beat you at Trivia. 
 Hah! 
 Hasn't happened so far. 
 Hah! Sounds like a challenge. 
 Why is Franky refusing? 
 She's trying to set conditions. 
 What does she want? 
 I mean, her demands are ridiculous. 
 Well, what? Early release? Special favours? 
 She's playing games, Derek. We give her this sort of power, God knows what she'll ask for next. 
 You do whatever you have to to keep her in line. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing, Liz? 
 Nothing. 
 You know you need to get your sh1t together, right? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Franky, you're needed in Education. 
 Ooh, hot stuff. 
 Doreen? 
 I know that day was really important to you and I am really sorry. 
 It really meant something and you turned it into a joke. 
 Well, I said I'm sorry - 
 And it's stuffed up your parole. 
 Didn't you even care what would happen? Now, you give it a rest. 
 And you being pissed all day - Yeah, yeah, here we go, blah, blah, blah! 
 I hate it when you're like this! 
 Like what? 
 Miss Davidson was right, you don't deserve that job. 
 What? Yes, she offered me peer worker and I said no because I didn't want you to be upset. 
 She offered you peer worker? 
 Yeah, and I turned it down, Liz. 
 Oh, why don't you take it? 
 I don't care! 
 Maybe I will! 
 You'll last five minutes! 
 What? I said you won't last five minutes. 
 Why is that, Liz? 
 Why? Yeah. 
 Because you're dumb and black and the women are never going to talk to you in the same way that they talk to me! That's why! 
 That's why. 
 I can't believe you said that. 
 You're supposed to be my friend, Liz. 
 Ah, Miss Davidson. 
 I want to do it. I want to be peer worker. 
 You've changed your mind. 
 I thought a lot about what you said and you're right. 
 I want to help the women in here. 
 I'm really pleased to hear that. 
 Don't worry, you're going to be great. 
 I knew you wouldn't be able to resist. 
 So I brought some brochures for us to talk through, see if anything appeals. 
 What appeals to you? 
 Apart from me. 
 Brochures, Franky. 
 Uhhh. It's a big decision. 
 Why did you choose law? 
 I mean, there's various career opportunities. 
 There's plenty of university courses by correspondence we can look at. 
 We've got an hour a week, I want to make the most of it. 
 You didn't answer the question. 
 I don't intend to. 
 Did you not understand the question? 
 You sound like a lawyer, what about law? 
 I've missed this. 
 'Attention, compound, attention, compound. Count will commence in ten minutes.' 
 What's the view like from down there? 
 Long way from being peer worker. 
 I can understand the fresher girls stepping out of line, not knowing, but someone who's been around as long as you and I have? 
 You disappoint me, Liz. 
 You don't have the privileges of a peer worker any more. 
 No fence to sit on. You want to make sure you come down on the right side. 
 It's a lot to think about. We need more time. 
 I don't expect you to make your decision today but you have to keep in mind the closing dates for applications. 
 So you don't have much time. 
 I mean, is there anything here that even interests you? 
 Yeah. 
 Franky - 
 But I don't know if I can say. 
 I mean, once it's out there, it's out there. 
 I don't want to limit myself. 
 Well, I just want - 
 It's like s*x, you know. to maximise our time together. 
 When you first start f*cking it's scary and exciting, cos there's this whole world you know nothing about. 
 But you don't want to look like an idiot. 
 So you skip the exploration and you do what you think's expected. 
 Really, isn't that the best bit? 
 When it's new, scary, a little bit dangerous. 
 We're here to talk about your future career. 
 How can you help me choose a career if you don't get me? 
 I had s*x with guys for ages cos I thought that was what I had to do. 
 It was OK... but something was missing. 
 Then I f*cked a woman. 
 I'd been getting it wrong for years. 
 So now I never could admit to anything without exploring every possibility. 
 You enjoyed that. 
 What? 
 You were being deliberately provocative. 
 No, I wasn't. 
 It did nothing for me. 
 
 
 
 Hello. 
 Hello! 
 Another lawyer to follow in the fine footsteps of the Davidson family. 
 If only he knew... 
 What a dirty girl I am. 
 We gotta close the blinds. 
 Why? No, don't, don't. 
 So people can't see in. 
 So? Give them something to talk about. 
 Just wait! 
 They're shut now. 
 You're such a spoilsport! 
 Mm! 
 What do you want to do to me? 
 I just want you. 
 Come on, say it. 
 I love you. 
 No, that's not what I want to hear. 
 Oh! Oh, oh, what are you doing? 
 Erica... 
 Pull my f*cking hair! 
 Hey? 
 Pull my f*cking hair. I don't want to f*ck like a married couple. 
 What?! 
 What? 
 Erica, what... Forget it. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. 
 What... What was that? 
 So what was that all about? 
 Um... Nothing. 
 I just wanted to try something different, that's all. 
 So we've got a problem. 
 No. 
 Of course not, I'm sorry. Seriously, just forget it. 
 Are you bored with me or something? 
 No! 
 You know we can try whatever you want. 
 Just tell me what you want me to do. 
 What would you like? 
 Yeah, you've kind of killed the mood now. 
 It's s*x, Mark, it's supposed to be dirty sometimes. 
 It doesn't have to be so... 
 So what, Erica? Nice! It doesn't have to be so nice all the time! 
 Mark - 
 f*ck off! 
 Don't strike me. 
 Get the f*ck away from me! 
 f*ck, you want to get married... now? 
 Well, not exactly this second. 
 Yeah, but you've always said no. 
 What, you don't want to marry me now? 
 Wheee! 
 I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you! 
 Wish we could help her. 
 Why? She's a nasty drunk. 
 She was like that the last time she got on the booze. 
 Doreen, Governor wants to see you. 
 Bea. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Liz? 
 Liz? Hey, Liz! 
 Lizzie? Mr Jackson! 
 Hey! She just passed out. 
 Move, move away from her. 
 Liz? Liz, can you hear me? 
 Zero-four to zero-one. Medical assistance in exercise yard, over! 
 What did she take? 
 I don't know. 
 You need to tell me. 
 I don't know. She just fell over. 
 I don't know, she just hit the deck. 
 All right, back to your units. Spot check, ladies. 
 Spot check. 
 Is Liz OK? Can we see her? 
 Your peer worker can. 
 Yeah, we don't have one. 
 Yeah. 
 Doreen! Haven't you told them yet? 
 Nah. 
 What's the matter, Francesca? One down. 
 What do you know about it, Jacqueline? 
 Nothing I can recall. Well, you know better than to f*ck with my family. 
 Hey, how come you didn't tell us? 
 Yeah, does Liz know? 
 It only just happened. I wanted to say something but then Liz collapsed. 
 It's good you're doing it. 
 You'd look after Liz. 
 Yeah, she needs it. She's been going off the rails. 
 How long are we going to be locked in here for? Could be a while. 
 Well, I'm going to bed, then. 
 What, now? It's only four o'clock. 
 Yeah, I didn't say I was sleeping. 
 Hey, er, tell us about Mr Jackson's body again. No! 
 No, no! 
 I was just asking. 
 Selfish! 
 Jacs is getting desperate. I want you to look out for yourself. 
 It wasn't Jacs. 
 You're f*cking kidding me! 
 I didn't mean to hurt her, Franky. 
 I wanted to teach her a lesson, make her a bit sick and get her off the booze. 
 I didn't know she'd pass out. 
 What did you do? 
 I put bleach in it. 
 Bleach? Yes, I - 
 You're really lucky she's not dead. 
 I know. I want to tell her I'm sorry. 
 You don't say a word of this to anyone. 
 If we start turning on each other we've got nothing, and if Jacs finds out, this comes back on me. 
 Now, you don't do another f*cking thing without my say so. 
 You keep your mouth shut. 
 Get to your room. Go! 
 f*cking three-year-old! 
 f*ck! 
 Oh, come on! You've called Mark, please leave a message. 
 Mark, I've been trying to call you all morning. 
 You couldn't... 
 At least send me a text. 
 Or something. 
 Erica, welcome. 
 Hi, Tom. 
 I hope you don't mind meeting here. 
 No. 
 Come through. 
 Champagne. 
 I insist. 
 I'm quite surprised your father agreed to take on this case. 
 It's not something his firm would normally consider. 
 Yeah, well, my father isn't the one who's here. 
 Hm. So I see. 
 Everyone deserves the right to representation. 
 Even those that work in this industry. A job's a job. 
 And some are more alternative than others. 
 I'm impressed. 
 Five minutes and you haven't batted an eyelid, and there was I thinking all you lawyers were a bunch of clenched... arseholes. 
 You hired me to do a job, Tom, I don't care where we meet. 
 See anything you like? I'm going to need a couple of signatures. 
 I could show you around. 
 No, thanks. 
 I like you, Erica. 
 It will be fascinating to see where your career takes you. 
 Oh! 
 We're all done. 
 Great. 
 I will need to see you again when the matter's resolved. 
 Whenever you like. 
 Thank you, Tom. 
 Argh! 
 The Department want to meet about Franky. 
 They want to put out a press release. Is now a good time? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you reckon I'm a nice person, Bea? 
 Yeah, course I do. Why? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Everything all right? 
 Yeah, just watching some telly. 
 The women trust the peer worker, right? 
 Well, they all trusted Liz. 
 And the peer worker's meant to look out for the women, isn't she? 
 She's meant to. 
 Hey. You'll be fine. 
 It just takes time, that's all. 
 I'm home. Hey! Cor, you gave us such a big fright. 
 How are you feeling? 
 My guts are sore. 
 Can I get you something? Do you want water, tea...? 
 Water would be good. 
 Right. 
 You're looking a lot better than the last time I saw you. Hope so. 
 Here you are, love. 
 Thanks. 
 Mm. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, I'll talk to you later. 
 See you. 
 What are we watching? 
 I'm so sorry, Dor. 
 I never thought you'd say something like that, Liz. 
 Neither did I. 
 It's the booze, you know. I drink and then I say stuff - 
 That's a crap excuse, Liz. 
 Yeah, you're right, it is. 
 You don't ever - ever - play the black card with me, Liz. 
 Sorry. 
 Doreen is so upset. 
 Yeah, it's going to take her a while. 
 I did say some pretty shocking things. 
 I heard. You said some pretty rude things to me, too. 
 Oh, mate, I am so sorry if I embarrassed you with all that masturbation stuff. 
 Sorry. 
 You know, um... I was 18 when I married Harry. Oh. 
 Pregnant. 
 Sick through most of it. 
 s*x was the last thing I felt like. 
 Fair enough. 
 Made him pretty angry. 
 Is that when he started hitting you? 
 Oh. 
 I'm so sorry, Bea. 
 Just s*x, you know, it's... 
 For me, it's always been... 
 Not... Not crash hot? 
 Not crash hot. 
 Nah, I'm not a prude. But you're right, I have never... done that. 
 Well, my friend, now is your time. 
 Give it a go, eh? 
 There is nothing wrong in making yourself feel good, Bea. 
 Nothing. 
 Thanks. 
 Mark. 
 Baby, I've been trying to call you all day. 
 When have I ever mistreated you, Erica? 
 You haven't. 
 Right. 
 Never. I treat you with respect. 
 Yes. 
 Now, if you don't want that, then I think maybe you're with the wrong guy. 
 No, I'm not. 
 OK, so what was last night all about? 
 Come on, I'm tough, I can handle it, tell me. 
 Erica - 
 I don't want to fight about this. 
 Answer the question, then. 
 You know I've had a really hard time at work. 
 I wanted to try something different. 
 Because you're bored? 
 No, because it was a spur of the moment thing. It was just a thing. 
 I thought we had a good s*x life. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 We've been engaged for five years. 
 And we keep pushing it back and back and back and now we don't even talk about it. 
 Maybe it's never going to happen. 
 You know what it's been like trying to get out of Dad's firm. Mm-hm. 
 You know what it's like and then I get into Wentworth and then I get a promotion. 
 You know I'm stressed out. 
 I'm stressed out and I'm taking it out on you and that's not fair. 
 I'm not going to change, Erica. 
 This is it. 
 If you are not happy with that then you need to tell me... and walk away. 
 No, that's not what I... 
 No, that's not what I want. 
 I love you. 
 I want to be your wife. 
 Anderson. 
 Here. 
 Birdsworth. 
 Here. 
 And Smith. 
 Here. 
 All right. Good night, ladies. 
 Good night, Mr Jackson. 
 Hey, Mr Jackson. 
 Sweet dreams. 
 Good night, Boomer. 
 Good night, Mr Jackson. 
 Good night, ladies. 
 Woo! 
 Tell me what you want me to do. 
 Just love me.
