 Nice colour. 
 Yeah. 
 Do it yourself? 
 I'm a hairdresser. 
 What's your name? 
 Debbie. 
 I'm Brayden. Brayden Holt. 
 You, young lady, at the desk. 
 The dog detected an illegal substance. We have to do a strip search. What? 
 She's 16! I'm not going to let them touch her! Bea! 
 He was wearing it the day she died. 
 Whoever killed Meg, took that bracelet. 
 Who the f*ck has been going through my stuff? 
 23 Cromwell Avenue. 
 That's where she lives, doesn't she? 
 Young Debbie. I knew this girl once, hit and run. 
 What do you want? 
 Get the f*ck off me! 
 Al right, Bea. Do the honours. 
 I had no choice. 
 She threatened my daughter. 
 I don't give a sh1t about your family. 
 If you're stupid enough to live your life, that's your problem. 
 'I'd like to welcome everyone today to hear all of us talk about our journey.' 
 'There's been a few people in my life who have tried to push me, never worked out too well.' 
 'For them.' 
 'Most people would think being in here is the worst thing that could happen.' 
 'It's gonna sound a bit crazy but, for me, it's the best thing.' 
 'I knocked a few heads together.' 
 'Got to know the slot real well.' 
 'The thing I'm most proud about is the peer-worker programme.' 
 'I remember when I first came here, there was nothing like it.' 
 'And just quietly, I got a real buzz out of passing my HSC.' 
 'I'm sure you'll all keep that to yourselves.' 
 'Outside, my life was a mess.' 
 'And I hurt a lot of people.' 
 'Then, Franky taught me this trick and it worked most of the time.' 
 'It stopped me from going bunta.' 
 'It's helped me as much as the other women.' 
 'And the women really listen to me.' 
 'After six years, things have changed.' 
 'And I finally have a family.' 
 'And it's all because of one person.' 
 'I haven't been in the slot for over six months.' 
 The governor and I have organised this event but it's us women that made it happen. 
 'I've changed.' 
 I've changed. 
 I've changed. 
 So, I want everyone to be clear about how things will run today. 
 Liz has organised the women. 
 The women have been instructed about what they can speak about. 
 You're putting a lot of trust in Liz. 
 Like the women, Liz is aware of how important today is to everyone. 
 Including you. 
 No, to all of us. This is our chance to show the department that we're making a difference in these women's lives and that they have a real chance on the outside. 
 Matt, you'll wrangle the women. Make sure they stick to running order. 
 I'm not rostered. 
 With the extra shifts covering the wet cells and the slot, I think I'm done. 
 Fine. Well, OK. Linda, you'll take his place. 
 For all of those who are rostered, you can mention the increased numbers in my programmes, the improved conditions for the women. But not the pressure it puts on officers. 
 As there's an ongoing police investigation, we will not mention the riot. 
 Anything you'd like to add? 
 So, we're all clear. Thank you. 
 Will? 
 Er, is there anything new with the investigation? 
 I haven't heard anything? 
 Every time I ask, the cops give me the same bullshit answer. 
 No new leads. 
 Yeah, it's... 
 None of the women are speaking. 
 There's no standout suspects. 
 Makes your life easier. 
 Takes the heat off. 
 Especially with today. 
 Well, no. I want to know what happened to Meg. We all do. 
 And, if I hear of anything, I'll let you know. 
 All you can do is let the police work through their investigation. 
 You all right? 
 Mum's gonna freak. 
 She'll be fine. 
 She said on the phone to stay away. 
 She probably reckons, after the last time, you'd wig out coming back. 
 I dunno. I can't do this. 
 Hey, it's not gonna happen again. 
 And you wanna see her. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, let's go. 
 Hey, come on, love. 
 Not long now, eh? 
 Liz, nice to see you again. 
 Hi, Rachel. Hi, Rachel. 
 I'll be back in an hour. 
 How have you been since we last met? 
 You right? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, um, good. Yeah, busy. Busy. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I've been helping the governor with this big event today. 
 And she thinks I've got a better chance of getting the women to open up and talk about themselves more than she does. 
 Well, that's something I can put in the report for your parole hearing. 
 Mrs Jackson put in a request a couple of months ago and it's been approved. 
 Your parole hearing is in two weeks' time. 
 That soon? 
 We'll have time to prepare everything. 
 Right. 
 Now, do you know where you'll be staying once you'll released? 
 'Can I give you a cuddle?' 
 Wooh! I love you. 
 Liz? 
 Um, well, I haven't made parole yet. 
 I'll have to set up appointments and meetings. 
 It will all be in the report. 
 I can't do that until I know where you'll be staying. 
 And what sort of support system you'll have on the outside. 
 Right. 
 I thought we agreed you'd stay away for a while. 
 It's too hard to talk on the phone. 
 It's just for a while, after everything that happened last time you were here. 
 I just wanted to see you. 
 What's wrong with that? 
 I didn't get searched. 
 Good. 
 Good. 
 Sorry. It's great to see you. 
 The last time you appeared before the board, they expressed some concern about how you would cope with life on the outside. 
 With your drinking. 
 Well, I haven't had a drink for 18 months. 
 You need a support system that's not just AA meetings. Yeah. Counselling. 
 You really need your family. 
 You don't have to worry about that. 
 You know, I'll get on to it. 
 So, how's everything at home? 
 Dad's... 
 Dad. he hasn't actually been around much. 
 Really? 
 And school? 
 How are your examines going? 
 I get my results back in a few weeks. Good. 
 Mum? 
 How did you get here today? 
 I caught the bus. 
 Listen, I want you to be careful. 
 Don't go out by yourself, especially at night. 
 If anyone comes up to you you don't know, I want you to find somewhere safe. 
 Do you think something's going to happen to me? 
 Well, just... 
 Some of the women in here might use you to get to me. 
 You can't expect me to sit at home all the time. 
 I can't protect you while I'm in here. 
 I'm not going to have no life because you are. 
 I need to pee. 
 No smiles today for Mummy? 
 I want you to come home. 
 You know I will soon, baby. 
 I miss you. 
 Do you need to go to the toilet? 
 I think you do. 
 Come on. Go with Auntie Manda to the toilet. I don't want to. 
 Come on. Do what Auntie Manda says, honey. I love you. 
 Good girl. 
 Come on. You know what to do. 
 Sit on the toilet. 
 I can't go. You've had your chocolates. Come on. 
 I didn't eat it. 
 Are you fibbing me? 
 It hurts when I go. 
 I don't want the chocolate any more. 
 sh1t! Come on. We're leaving. 
 Ronnie, she didn't eat the chocolate. 
 Oh, you're f*cking kidding me. 
 I gave it to her in the car. Mum. 
 She ate it about 45 minutes ago. 
 Oh, my God! f*ck! 
 Oh, my God! Amy! Amy! 
 What happened? Somebody f*cking help us! Listen! She just collapsed. 
 Code black. 
 Will she be all right? 'Mum?' 
 'Something's wrong with Artie.' 
 'What?' He's lying on the floor. 
 He drank out of this bottle. 
 Artie? Artie? 
 Artie? Ollie? 
 OK, out the way, Ronnie. Move away. 
 Is she going to be all right? 
 Code black. What's wrong with her? 
 Everyone clear the room. Quickly. 
 I want to speak to my mum. 
 I love you. 
 Check the airways. What happened, Ronnie? I don't know. I don't know. 
 Amy? If you don't tell us, we can't help you. 
 She's unconscious. She could die. 
 She's supposed to sh1t it out! 
 sh1t what out? 
 Come on, Ronnie? 
 The gear. Heroin? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Get her out. 
 No, I don't want to go. No. 
 Come on. No. 
 Get her out of here! 
 No! Amy! 
 We'll look after her. Amy! 
 Five, six, seven. 
 How could anyone do that to their own kid? 
 Oh, my God! 
 He's got a pulse. 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 Booze. 
 Get the ambulance! 
 He'll be all right. Don't you worry. 
 I need an ambulance. It's my son. 
 It's OK. 
 He's five. We think it's er... 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's alcohol poisoning. I'm sorry. 
 He drank it by mistake. 
 It was in a soft-drink bottle. 
 Liz? 
 Hmm? 
 What? 
 Are you OK? 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
 Can it get any worse? A death in the prison? A child after Meg's? 
 I'm thinking we shouldn't go ahead with the event. 
 We're not cancelling. There are a lot of mothers, they'll be furious. 
 Today will be a difficult time to put them under pressure. 
 If we cancel, we'll be under pressure. 
 What about Jacs and Franky? 
 This could set thing off again. 
 Keep them under control. 
 You're pushing this event. 
 Postponing for a couple of weeks won't change anything. 
 It will raise questions I'm not prepared to answer. 
 Sort out your women. The department will walk out of here today with smiles on their faces not a boot up their arse. 
 I hated Debbie seeing that. 
 I didn't get a chance to say goodbye properly either. 
 Are you sure you're OK? 
 No, don't feel sorry for me. 
 That little girl could die. 
 I didn't think even Jacs would go that far to use their kid to bring in drugs. 
 Hold on. Jacs? Oh, yeah. 
 She calls the shots and Ronnie does what she's told. 
 It'll be Ronnie who cops it in the neck. 
 There's women in here who don't tolerate kids being used. 
 What will they do to her? 
 If her kid dies, she could too. 
 What? And Jacs gets away with it? 
 Piss off! 
 We hate you, Ronnie! 
 Jacs? 
 May I come in? 
 A visit from the governor. 
 Now, isn't this special? 
 Vinnie was released this morning. 
 Good to see you keeping up with current events. 
 I organised for him to come visit you today. 
 With everything going on with your big event, I didn't think you'd find time for me. 
 Can't be seen playing favourites. 
 No, you can't. 
 I'll organise an officer to escort you when he arrives. 
 Thank you, governor. 
 If there are any further incidences today, your visit is cancelled. 
 I'll be on my best behaviour. 
 Oh! I thought the women would tear Ronnie apart. 
 It would've been Jacs who gave her the order to do it. 
 You're lucky Jacs didn't use Debbie. 
 This time. Ronnie's got to live with what she did. 
 Someone's got to teach that old bag a lesson. 
 Are you gonna stick your neck out? 
 Yeah, thought not. 
 Big day today, girls. 
 Jacs gets her man back. 
 I knew those pricks wouldn't make the charges stick. 
 You sure he didn't turn on the inside? 
 Probably the best f*ck he's had in his life. 
 Keeping a healthy distance, Francesca. That's good. 
 I'm sure he's looking forward to it as much as you are. 
 Of course he is. 
 Problem? 
 Well? 
 Nothing. 
 We were just talking about Ronnie. 
 Yeah. We're one down today. 
 So, let's get on with it. 
 Bea, come and see me later. 
 Got a little job for you. 
 So, I've got to go and see her. 
 Do I have to go by myself? 
 Franky's not going to protect you, is she? Can't I get out of it? 
 Franky? 
 I'm reading. 
 Jacs has put Bea in a no-win situation. 
 She wasn't the one with her hand in the steam press. 
 She made a choice. 
 Liz told me what they do to women in here who have kids. 
 Jacs threatened my daughter. 
 Can't you do something? 
 Normal rules don't apply to Jacs. 
 Yeah. Your daughter's f*cked. 
 Or you are. 
 Anyway, one of you is. 
 Mr Jackson. 
 Making house calls? 
 How's the hand? It's fine. 
 If you're nicer to the officers, these accidents wouldn't happen. 
 Are you volunteering? 
 For a price. Information. 
 It must be frustrating not knowing. 
 You didn't find anything in my room, did you? 
 Just tell me what you know about the riot. 
 Which one of you guys killed my wife? 
 What makes you think it was one of us? 
 How are the women doing after this morning? 
 Well, they hate it when a kid's used like that. 
 Of course. Just take a seat anywhere you like. 
 You know, I see today as an opportunity to take everyone's mind off it. 
 This is something positive. 
 What about Franky? 
 Is she still on board? 
 She's the one drawing the crowd. 
 You said she'd speak, Liz. 
 She changed her mind. 
 Come on. 
 Focus on the other women. 
 Make sure they're ready. 
 Have they been practising? 
 Yeah. This is a chance for you to show the VIPs the positive changes, that you've got something to give back to society when you're released. 
 Have you finished your speech? 
 I've started. 
 But I've just been so busy organising everything else. 
 No, I haven't. No. 
 I haven't finished mine. 
 You said you'd speak, Liz. 
 'I don't like it, Mummy.' 
 I don't like it when you go all funny. I know, Artie. 
 And I'm going to try my very best, OK? 
 I promise that I'm not going to drink any more. 
 And I'm going to be the best mum that I can be. 
 You promise you'll stop? 
 Yes, Soph. 
 Because I don't want to hurt you any more. 
 And we'll do everything we can to help, won't we, kids? 
 Yes. 
 I was thinking, Celeste, you know how your birthday's coming up. 
 Maybe I could help organise the party. 
 I'd love that, Liz. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. 
 You don't need me up there. 
 It's not going to look very good if the woman who organised the event doesn't speak at it. 
 Yeah, it's... 
 I want it to go really well. 
 I've booked the caterers and, um, I've ordered the flowers. I didn't know what to do about the music. 
 Do you want a band or a DJ? 
 I'll be happy with whatever you choose. 
 Yeah, but it's not my party, Celeste. 
 Oh, Liz, come on. 
 You're doing a great job. 
 See you inside. 
 I believe in you, Liz. 
 I mean, you initiated the peer-worker programme. 
 This is your time to show everyone what a success story you are. 
 That's everything from the day before the riot. 
 Don't know what you're expecting to find, mate. 
 The governor's due soon. 
 You'd better get a move on, mate. 
 OK? 
 Did you hear what happened in Visitors this morning? 
 A little kid was used as a pack mule. 
 A little girl, she was. 
 Couldn't have been older than nine or ten. 
 They should bring back the death penalty for scum like that. 
 That's the trouble with people in charge. 
 I want a copy of it. No. 
 I'll pay you for it. 
 Yeah, and I'll get the arse. 
 No-one will know. 
 And, if they do, I'll wear it. 
 Take it. It's all I've got on me. 
 Franky. 
 I'm popular today. 
 I'd like you to speak today at the event. 
 I told Liz I wasn't interested. I thought it'd be right up your alley. 
 Kind of look sketchy. 
 No-one cares how you look, they want to hear you speak. 
 Well, I'm hurt. Don't you care? 
 You haven't said the magic word. 
 I can always ask Jacs. I thought you wanted it to be a success. 
 That's why I'm asking you. 
 Please. 
 Well, that wasn't so hard, was it? 
 I'm in. 
 sh1t! 
 Oh, God! It stinks. 
 Yeah, it's meant to. 
 It's fermenting. Oh! 
 No, no. No, not until after the speeches. I need a bit of Dutch. 
 No. I don't think I can get through this without some. 
 You don't think I don't want some? 
 I want to but I'm not going to. 
 You'll be right. You'll be right. 
 No, I won't. You will. 
 Listen, listen. Look at me. 
 Every time I talk, I open my mouth, people laugh. 
 No, they don't, Boomer. They do. 
 You bloody idiots! Oh! 
 I thought you were a screw. 
 Oh, ha-ha. 
 How long has this been going on? 
 Boomer just showed me. 
 Oh, yeah. We break it out tonight after the speeches. 
 You should be practising not mucking about with home brew. 
 All right. Think of all the dogs through the unit. 
 I just want to check. 
 No! 
 Hey! Don't you touch it. 
 Come on, Boom. 
 Go! 
 
 
 
 Woah! 
 You written your speech? 
 No. Why not? 
 Don't you want to impress the parole board? 
 I don't need to impress anyone. 
 Why? 
 Can you just go and practise your speech? Jeez! All right. 
 See you later. 
 Oh, Liz, it's looking beautiful. 
 No, no, no. 
 It's too busy. 
 And I love my scarf. Thank you. 
 Does it go with the outfit? 
 I don't know. I don't care. 
 Well, your friends will. 
 They'll be here in a minute in their fancy cars and designer duds and they'll want everything to be perfect. And it will be. 
 I think I need a smaller vase here. 
 It's so windy today, everything's a mess. 
 Look, why don't I get Oliver to bring down another table? 
 No, I want everything together. 
 All right. I was just trying to help. 
 Why? You don't think I can do it. 
 Of course I do. I knew it! 
 I knew you'd have a go, Celeste. 
 Oh, my God! I knew it. 
 Don't do this today. 
 You promised Mum. 
 The kids. It's just a mouthful to take the edge off, right? 
 Because you have no idea what I'm going through. 
 And I am trying. If you really loved us, you wouldn't drink. 
 You know I love you and the kids. 
 First sign of stress, you reach for the bottle. 
 For once in your life don't stuff up. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh-huh. Um, thank you. 
 I'll inform the mother. 
 The child is going to be OK. 
 I'd like you to get that information to the women as soon as possible. 
 Obviously, Ronnie will be in protection for the rest of her sentence. 
 And today is still going ahead. 
 You've got to be kidding. 
 And under no circumstance are you to mention the incident this morning. 
 Yeah, that would definitely put a damper on things, wouldn't it? 
 You won't be here, so shut up. 
 Since when have you been on board with this bleeding heart bullshit? 
 I'm voicing what everyone thinks. 
 Enough. 
 As ex-army you understand the concept of taking an order. 
 That's an order. 
 Thank you. 
 Vera, can I speak to you for a minute? 
 I need you to run interference with the other officers. 
 You're my deputy. 
 I... 
 I did tell you this would happen. 
 I'm asking you to bridge the gap, that's all. 
 But I don't feel comfortable. I know you don't want to get offside with the others, particularly Fletch. 
 Put your personal feelings aside. 
 But... 
 I don't have personal feelings for... 
 I don't have any personal feelings for any of the officers. 
 I... 
 I'll do my best. 
 Wait a minute. What are you saying? 
 I'm gonna go write a speech. 
 You are going to do a speech now? 
 Yes. You wouldn't when I asked you. 
 Because I got a personal plea from the governor. Get off. 
 What are you going to say? 
 Ah! Spoiler. Huh? 
 Oh! Can't tell you. 
 Amy's going to be OK. 
 Oh, thank God. Yeah, the officers have been spreading the word. 
 Screws, Red. 
 Smith? Jacs is waiting for you. 
 You got a plan? 
 Maybe you could take her out. 
 Can you send Boomer with her? 
 No. You've got to learn what life's like without me. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You'll be right. 
 Have fun. 
 Come in. 
 Must be a few months now since you arrived. 
 Eight weeks, three days. 
 Still keeping track? That's good. 
 Takes discipline to survive in here. 
 Mind and body. 
 It's easy to get complacent and let the days bleed into one. 
 Stop checking your reflection and you become one of the herd. 
 But you're better than that, I can tell. You're like me. 
 You were angry this morning. 
 We all were. As a mother, that must have affected you. 
 Yeah, it did. 
 Of course it did. 
 Imagine if it was Debbie. 
 Debbie would never do that. 
 You're shaking. 
 Don't be nervous, Bea. 
 You're the one holding the scissors. 
 They think it takes a strong woman to rise to the top in here but it doesn't. 
 It takes a smart one. 
 One who chooses their moment. 
 And understands the repercussions if they get it wrong. 
 One well-chosen moment can take you straight to the top. 
 And one mistake can finish you. 
 You see, Bea, anger is a healthy emotion on the outside. 
 In here, unless you can follow through, best to keep it to yourself. 
 Vinnie's coming in tonight. 
 He'll want me to look my best. 
 How would you like me to do it? 
 Surprise me. 
 Oh, and just so you know, Ronnie wasn't working for me. 
 She got desperate. 
 I'd never use a child like that. 
 "I will be seeking monetary compensation..." 
 Hey, Jacs? 
 "..for the three months of my life wasted by police incompetence and the victimisation from the so-called Justice Department." 
 "I trust they've learnt their lesson." 
 "And I hope this puts an end to the harassment of my family, so we can finally get on with our lives." 
 "Vinnie Holt left court and returned to his Bacchus Marsh compound." 
 "His wife Jacqueline is still incarcerated..." 
 Hey! Check out the fresh start. 
 Jacs won't be happy about that. 
 So, I should leave that part about me? 
 She only wanted me to do her hair. 
 And next time she whistles? 
 I made a stupid mistake. 
 I should never have caved to Jacs. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 If you are with me, you do what I say. 
 Everyone ready? 
 Yeah, Miss Miles. 
 Reckon I'm going to piss myself. 
 Ah, no, you'll be right. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, Liz. 
 'Have a bit of faith in yourself, Liz.' 
 'Have a bit of faith in yourself.' 
 You're doing a great job. 
 OK, hair. 
 Come on, Jacs, hair. 
 I've just had it done. 
 Hair. 
 OK. Mouth. I need a few minutes to fix this now. 
 Mouth. 
 Ears. 
 You still got that boyfriend? 
 Bet you hardly see him. You're in here as much as we are. Breasts. 
 It's almost a physical pain, isn't it? Being kept apart so long? 
 Arms. 
 The smell of him. 
 That's what I miss. 
 Breathing him in. 
 Turn around. 
 Is he good looking this boyfriend of yours? Or did you have to settle? 
 Feet. 
 You should make more of an effort. 
 You could be quite attractive. 
 Bend over and part your cheeks. 
 Get dressed. 
 You haven't got anything in black, have you? 
 Vinnie loves me in black. 
 And then there's Miss Davidson. 
 At first, I thought she took an interest in me because she wanted something. 
 Not that there's anything wrong with that. But I was wrong. 
 She got me. 
 She believed in me. 
 She saw past the front. 
 She saw who I was. 
 It helped that she was hot. 
 When you're locked up in here, it's pretty easy to feel forgotten. 
 Like you're nothing. 
 Like you're no-one. 
 Before Miss Davidson, a lot of these women had no hope. 
 But she changed that with her programmes and her encouragement. 
 She's given me a hunger,... a desire... to be a better person. 
 And, thanks to Miss Davidson, I will be. 
 How the hell did you do that without notes? 
 'I want it right and it's all wrong.' 
 'Everything is wrong. I can't do it. I can't do it, Ollie.' 
 You going next? 
 No, I've got to go to the loo. Liz! 
 Liz! I've got to go to the toilet. 
 I've got to go to the toilet. 
 All right, Doreen, you go next. 
 I'd like to thank Miss Davidson for letting us speak today. 
 Most people think being in here is the worst thing that could happen. 
 It's going to sound crazy but, for me, it was the best thing... 
 'You're pathetic.' 
 'You're pathetic.' You're pathetic. 
 Get inside. 
 f*ck you! f*ck you! 
 You won't care if I'm there anyway. 
 You're hiding out here getting drunk. Mum! 
 Nana! 
 I tried so hard to make everything perfect and it's all wrong. 
 What do you expect when you're drunk all the time? Liz! 
 The posh friends are going to laugh at me, right? Oh! 
 Everything I've done, I wanted it right and it's all wrong! 
 It's all wrong! 
 I couldn't do it. 
 Sophie, get away from there! 
 I couldn't do it. Mum, please, stop! 
 Get inside. Pack your bags. 
 And get out. 
 No, please. Don't. 
 Please! No! Sophie! 
 Get away from there! 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 Outside, my life was a mess and I hurt a lot of people. 
 But now I'm clean and I'm learning new things. 
 And I finally have a family too, so... 
 Thank you. 
 My name is Sue but they call me Boomer because I am always coming back. 
 There was a time when I used to bash a lot of people because people make me mad sometimes. 
 There was one time when I was very angry and I knocked a few heads together. 
 And I got to know the slot real well. 
 But then Franky taught me this trick. 
 And, most of the time, it works. 
 It stops me from going bunta. 
 Puppies and jelly. 
 I get this picture in my head of puppies jumping around in jelly and they're all mushy and cute and sticky. 
 And it stops me from going off. 
 I haven't been in the slot now for six months. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah! 
 Wooh! 
 Go, Boom! 
 You did good. Thank you, Sue, that was very insightful. 
 We did have a final presenter but I think she got cold feet. So, I'd like to thank the three women who did speak because I know it takes a lot of courage. 
 Oh, no, here she is. 
 Our final speaker for today. 
 This is our peer-worker Elizabeth Birdsworth. 
 Yep. 
 Mw-mw! 
 Many familiar faces in here. 
 Is she pissed? 
 She hasn't had booze in ages. 
 I can see Judge Alsopp. Oh, mate. 
 You're looking great. 
 I haven't seen you in ages. 
 You're a bit of a spunk. 
 I really wanted to get it on with you. 
 Cos I haven't been laid in a while. 
 All you'd need is half an hour in my wet cell. 
 Get her out of here. No, hang on. 
 You all think we're in here to be rehabilitated, don't you? 
 Don't touch me. Don't touch me. 
 Get her out. Some women in here stick drugs up their kids' bums. 
 Get her out. No, no, no. 
 A little kid today OD'd, right? 
 And she nearly died. Come on. No-one told you that, did they, judge? 
 I apologise. 
 Get off me! 
 I can walk. 
 I'm not a f*cking cripple! 
 Get off! 
 Um... 
 Oh, my God! 
 Mum? 
 Mum?! Oh, my goodness! 
 Is Nana OK? 
 Oh, God! 
 What the hell was that? 
 You ruined today. You knew how important it was to the women. 
 And you just made them feel like idiots. 
 Liz, you have no chance of making parole now. 
 Anything to say? 
 I'm... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I couldn't do it. 
 I couldn't do it. 
 That's not good enough. 
 I couldn't... 
 I...couldn't do it. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Three months. 
 This is a bit special, isn't it? 
 Secret visits, intimate vetting. 
 Any chance of a whiskey? 
 Screws are the same in Walford, no sense of humour. 
 You look good. 
 How's business? 
 No problems while you're on the inside? 
 It kept ticking along. 
 You know what it's like. 
 A few well-placed phone calls. 
 Some reliable help. 
 Some not so. 
 That's a problem for tomorrow. 
 Today, it's just you and me, darling. 
 Who is she? 
 She works for my lawyer. 
 Her name is Cass. 
 She's nothing. 
 You know that. 
 You are my number one. 
 You've done something with your hair. 
 Looks good. 
 Do you need anything? 
 Don't f*cking flaunt her in public. 
 You know what that does to me in here? Show me some respect. 
 I think I've earned it. 
 I picked up some cheese for you on the way over. 
 Extra bitey. 
 Make sure the screws don't pinch it. 
 Hey, mate, mate! 
 Hey! Can I get a water? 
 Actually, make that two. 
 Where did you get this? 
 What did you give her? 
 You dropped something in her hand. 
 I found this. I was going to give it to you before in the office. 
 Thanks. 
 I found her bracelet in a corridor. 
 That was the day before the riot. 
 What was that about? She undermined me in front of another officer. 
 It's always on your terms, isn't it? 
 That's because it's my job. 
 I called her on it. 
 This is personal. This is about you and me and we need to talk. Enough. 
 You think it will disappear because you won't talk about it? 
 Take your hand off the door, please. 
 She laid the boot in. 
 Running won't solve it. 
 That's enough. 
 I was sure that, if I found the bracelet, I'd know who killed her. 
 See how f*cked it is? 
 This whole thing has got me seeing stuff, wondering. 
 And you're my best mate. 
 But this... 
 It's nothing. 
 The women, they... 
 One of them, they did it. 
 I've got to know who did that to Meg. 
 You can't do this by yourself, Will, OK? 
 You need to get some help. 
 Another Scotch, please. 
 And you don't need another Scotch. 
 f*ck off. 
 Oh! 
 Ah! 
 Kiss me! Kiss me! 
 Kiss me. 
 I've gotta go. 
 Why? 
 f*ck off. 
 f*ck. 
 f*ck!
