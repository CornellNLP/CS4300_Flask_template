 This is good sh1t. I'll bloody kill whoever gave it to you. 
 Toni, tell me who supplied you the drugs. 
 It was the teach. 
 What if gets out? 
 It won't, I'll make it go away. 
 Now get your things and leave the prison. 
 If you repeat that story to anyone, you will not get out of here and you will not see your daughter again. Do I make myself clear? 
 One down. Well, you know better than to f*ck with my family. 
 The Department will decide. 
 I'll do it. Great. 
 As long as you're my tutor. 
 So what's your name? Debbie. 
 I'm Brayden. Brayden Holt. 
 I don't give a sh1t about your family. 
 If you're stupid enough to keep 'em in your life, that's your problem. 
 Coming out tonight? 
 You going, Vera? 
 No, Adam's taking me out to... a show? 
 I understand you don't want to get off-side with the other officers, particularly Fletch. 
 I need you to put personal feelings aside. 
 What? I... I don't have... personal feelings for F... 
 'Lipstick can't change what you were born with.' 
 Some girls can wear make-up, some can't. 
 Better to know which one you are now so you don't go wasting any more of your money on this rubbish. 
 Hi, Vera. 
 Oh. Hi, Hayley. 
 I was... thinking about today. 
 Work. 
 When are you not? 
 I like my job. 
 Well, so do I, but... not 24/7. 
 Dunno, you hang around here often enough. That's my boss. 
 Karen's big on follow-up stories and your boss won't give me anything, so... 
 Oh, I like what you've done. 
 Oh, I'm just, you know, trying something new. 
 Yeah. Looks really good. 
 I spend way too much time in front of the mirror. 
 It's all part of the job. 
 If you like, I could make a suggestion? 
 Morning. 
 Hi. Like the lippy. 
 Aw, thanks! 
 Er... Fletch, want a coffee? 
 Oh, I'm - I'm good, thanks, Vera. 
 Yeah. Yeah, of course. Good. 
 Hey, volleyball looks like fun. 
 Put your name down. 
 Yeah, I dunno. Too busy with that boyfriend of yours? 
 Does he ever let you out? 
 Yeah, of course. Really? 
 Yeah, it's just, you know, he's got work dos and parties to go to and everyone likes him and my mum loves him and... 
 Oh, well. If you change your mind... 
 'Attention, compound. 
 Count will commence in ten minutes.' 
 Hi, it's me again. 
 Can someone pick up? 
 Er... Mr Fletcher? 
 Erm... so, the volleyball, what do you think? 
 Well, I put my name down for it. 
 Yeah, right. Well, it sounds like fun. So you said. 
 Vera, I've got a couple of interviews booked for the new teacher's position. I'd like you to be there. What time? 
 Just check with Mary Anne. 
 Mm-hm. 
 You know, I was thinking that, erm... wearing my hair back all the time was giving me headaches. 
 Well, I think that I'll, erm... sign up for the volleyball. 
 Good, yeah... 
 You know, I thought it might be nice if we spent a bit of time together outside of work. 
 What about the boyfriend? 
 No, I think he'd be fine about it. 
 Yep. 
 Really? 
 Mmm. 
 I wouldn't be. 
 I had a good time. 
 Me too. And I really liked the movie. Thank you. 
 Vera? Would you get inside and stop making such a fool of yourself? 
 Bea? 
 Er... something for you from Debbie. 
 Security's been through it. 
 Oh... thanks. 
 She, er... must be one of the good ones. 
 Yeah. 
 I wish I could get through to her. 
 I keep calling but she won't - 
 She's a teenager. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, keep trying. 
 And, er... if there's anything I can do... let us know. 
 Thanks. 
 Mr Jackson. 
 Liz. 
 Bea. Home delivery? 
 Hey, Doreen? 
 Doreen? 
 Hey. How's peer training going? 
 Yeah, good. 
 Hey, Toni's there. 
 What? Toni? 
 Tones? 
 Did you know? 
 Uh... are they meant to tell me? 
 You're the peer worker, you should know. 
 Toni! Why are you sitting with the girls from H3? 
 Is that where she's been moved to? 
 I didn't know she was coming out till now. 
 Boss wants to see you. 
 What's going on here? 
 Get up. Come on, don't f*ck around. 
 Hey, Tones? Remember who your friends are, mate. 
 Toni? 
 Come in. 
 Sit. 
 Here we go. 
 Thought we'd have a little chat before you start making friends over in the new unit. 
 Anyone over there gonna look out for you? 
 Keep your secrets? 
 I haven't even asked you, would you like a cup of tea? 
 Would you like one? 
 Milk? Sugar? 
 No. Thanks. 
 So... what should we talk about? 
 Let's start with who supplied you with the drugs. 
 Hey, Miss Bennett? 
 I like the hair, it looks good. 
 Franky! 
 Hey? 
 I grabbed some of your stuff. 
 There's a photo of Kaiya and some books I thought you might like to read. 
 Don't f*cking talk to me. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I was only trying to do the right thing by you and Kaiya. 
 You set me up. 
 I didn't want to. 
 I didn't know what else to do, Toni. 
 You were meant to look out for me. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Just f*cking leave me alone. 
 Have you lost your appetite, Tones? 
 This Toni thing is causing a bit of a stir. 
 They love having something to get worked up about. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 What's that? Oh, just opened. 
 Thought I'd check it out tonight. 
 Can I come? 
 Not busy with Adam? 
 No, I don't have anything on tonight. 
 Sure. Let's do it. 
 And a Bachelor of Law. 
 It's a really big course. 
 So you should have read the first three chapters? 
 OK. 
 So, Chapter One... the definition of a crime? 
 Legal definition - breaching the criminal laws that aim to protect the lives, property and rights of citizens. 
 Great. 
 The non-legal definition - acts that violate socially accepted rules of human, moral or ethical behaviour. 
 Stick to the legal. 
 Non-legal's much more interesting. 
 Yeah, but we can discuss it another time. 
 Some would argue moving Toni into another unit is a crime. 
 I'm not discussing other prisoners with you, Franky. 
 She's vulnerable. 
 She can't go back to your unit. 
 Yeah, and now she's fair game. 
 Toni lost her privileges when Kaiya left. 
 I mean, she can't share with Doreen anymore, you know that. 
 Moving on. Jurisprudence - laws, customs and rights for the administration of justice. 
 "Laws control the lesser man, right conduct controls the greater one." 
 It's Mark Twain. 
 It's like Toni. 
 The right thing to do would be to move her back in with us. 
 Well, it depends on your definition of 'right conduct.' 
 Yeah, it does. 
 I'm here to help you. 
 I'm here to help you. 
 Governor? 
 Time's up. 
 Moving Toni into H3 has unsettled the women. 
 It would unsettle them more if they knew she requested the move. 
 Yeah, I know, but I think we should just keep an eye on it. 
 Fine. 
 What, is there something else? 
 What? I don't think that Franky Doyle shows you enough respect. 
 I can handle Franky. 
 I know it's very easy to like her but I think we should draw a line. 
 These sessions are at the request of the department. 
 Thank you, Governor. 
 Oh, my bloody stitches are all over the place! 
 You've got to put the foot down. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Will it make it go any faster? 
 Vroom! 
 Hey. Look, this one. 
 How many times have I told you? 
 You've gotta make love, not war to that thing. 
 Yeah, well, you've got it easy. 
 How about we swap this for some lessons with Erica? 
 Nah! 
 Looking to improve yourself, are you, Boomer? 
 I wouldn't aim too high. 
 I wouldn't get too close to that thing. 
 You know how clumsy Nana can get. 
 Ooh! 
 What the f*ck? 
 Toni! 
 Get Toni off her! 
 Get off her! 
 Toni, back off or you're back in the slot. 
 What's her problem? 
 She's a loonbag. 
 'The source also raised concerns about Ms Davidson's unorthodox methods in dealing with the prisoners.' 
 Oh, she's gonna lose it! 
 I reckon we'll hear it from here when she does. Ooh, yeah! 
 I think Toni has come out too early. 
 The women are taking advantage of it. 
 Check this out. Remember that journo Hayley, who's been hanging around? 
 She's dug up some dirt on Erica. 
 'A source inside Wentworth Correctional Centre suggests that Erica Davidson won't be sticking around for long. The source went on to say that Davidson is overly ambitious and is using the governor's job and her legal background as a stepping stone for entering politics. The source also raised concerns about Ms Davidson's unorthodox methods in dealing with the prisoners.' 
 Oh, can you believe it? 
 Someone's in very deep sh1t! 
 Vera? Governor wants to see you. 
 Says it's urgent. 
 This is gutter journalism, Karen. 
 I thought you ran a better newsroom than this. 
 No, I won't give you an interview because I know exactly what angle you'll take. 
 Hayley won't give up her sources. 
 You've seen it, haven't you? 
 Yeah, just then. 
 Do you have any idea when the story came from? 
 No. Of course, I have my suspicions. 
 Matthew Fletcher has always made his feelings clear. 
 No, Fletch wouldn't do something like that. 
 Have you thought about Franky Doyle? 
 No. 
 Why would she do it? 
 Show the women what she can do? 
 No, to get that sort of information out, you'd have to - 
 It would, erm... take one phone call. 
 I didn't do it. Why would I? 
 Because you're angry with me. 
 And this is how you retaliate. 
 I'm smarter than that. After all the tutoring I gave you, I thought so. 
 We both know it was more than that. 
 That would be your ego talking. 
 That would be you in denial. 
 I'm suspending all your privileges. 
 You can't do that. 
 I don't have to justify myself to you. 
 No, but you can accuse me of anything you want. 
 Because I'm not the prisoner here. 
 Yeah, but you play games like one of us. 
 I am nothing like you. 
 This is crazy, Erica. 
 It is Miss Davidson! 
 You know what? I know what it's like to have that sh1t written about you. 
 Do you really think I'd do that to you? 
 Do you really think that I would deliberately stir things up between you and Jacs? 
 It wasn't me. 
 I promise you. 
 Got this for you. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Governor? 
 Yeah? 
 How did things go with Franky Doyle? 
 It wasn't her. 
 Is there anyone else you think it is? 
 I don't care, I've got bigger things to worry about. 
 Here's the address for the bar. 
 Erm... thanks. 
 Still coming? Yeah, yeah, I am, I just... I can't stay too late. 
 Adam does wanna meet up later. 
 Yeah, no worries. 
 Er... Fletch? Look... I, erm... I'm sorry about before. 
 I think you might have misunderstood what I meant. 
 I just meant that we should... not all hang out together at volleyball. 
 Hmm. 
 I don't think I did misunderstand. 
 Well, you did. Yeah. 
 Why are you wearing that? 
 Erm... just catching up with some work mates for a drink. 
 Tonight? 
 Yeah, I won't be late. 
 But you've got work tomorrow. 
 Yeah, it's just a drink. 
 What about me? 
 It's just a drink. 
 I think I'm coming down with something. 
 I've got such a sore throat and my head's aching. 
 I made you chicken cacciatore - your favourite. 
 Please don't go out tonight. 
 Don't leave me. 
 Mum, please! 
 'Tell your friends I'm not feeling well and I need you to stay home.' 
 I never go out. 
 Every time they ask me, I say no. 
 If they're real friends, they'll understand. No, they'll stop asking. 
 Nothing wrong with staying home, looking after your mother. 
 That's all I ever do! 
 I have no life. 
 I have no friends. 
 I have nothing. 
 Nothing except for this, this... house and you! 
 I'm sorry you're so unhappy! 
 No, I'm... 
 I'm not unhap- 
 I am, I... I am unhappy. 
 And it's my fault. 
 No, it's not, it's my fault for never saying what I want and for staying here and doing nothing and turning into you. 
 You know, I can go out another time. 
 It doesn't have to be tonight. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Mr Jackson? 
 Can't sleep, Bea? 
 No, I've been trying to get hold of Debbie but I can't get through to her. 
 You can try again tomorrow. No, no, she's never there during the day. 
 She'll be there now, so I was wondering if I could call her? 
 You know I can't let you use the phones outside of hours. 
 No, I know, I know that, but... 
 I just think I'm going to lose her if I don't know that she's OK, so please... 
 I just need to talk to her. 
 You said if there's anything you could do to help... 
 Harry, it's me. 
 What do you expect? Every time I do ring, you're never there. 
 That's no excuse. 
 So what's going on with you guys? 
 Don't give me that. Bring Debbie in. I want to know what's going on. 
 No, you listen to me, Harry. 
 You bring her in, all right? 
 Or I swear to God, I'll lose it. 
 No, Harry, you just do it, all right - Bea? 
 Harry? Bea, come on. 
 Let's get you back to the unit. 
 You're welcome. 
 I'm going out. 
 I won't be late. 
 Got anything stronger? 
 Like morphine. 
 It was the shots. 
 That's what did us in. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It was worth it, though. 
 We had fun. 
 Mmm. Yeah. 
 Thanks for letting me stay at your place. 
 Thanks for cancelling on Adam to kick on. 
 He was fine about it. 
 If we ever recover from this, we should do it again. 
 Absolutely. No getting out of karaoke next time. 
 I'll start practising. 
 I know. 
 I mean, look at her. 
 It's hard when your friends move on. 
 Even harder when those people who you think are friends turn out to be... not so friendly. 
 Toni's been through a really rough time. 
 Yeah, I know. She told me all about it yesterday, poor thing. 
 Look, I just wanna know she's OK. 
 She's in a better place. 
 Away from that fanny bandit. 
 I always thought Francesca had a cruel streak but to do that to one of her own... 
 Have you ever asked Toni who got her back onto the drugs? 
 Toni! 
 Toni? 
 I just wanted to... 
 Why did you go at Franky before? 
 Did she do something to you? 
 Toni! 
 Please, tell me. 
 Franky gave me the drugs. 
 What?! 
 No way. I wouldn't f*cking say it if it wasn't true. 
 She knew what would happen to Kaiya. 
 She promised me she'd never do that. 
 She made Bea a meal. 
 Yeah, well, that was different. 
 That was Franky showing Bea who's boss. 
 And you reckon she wouldn't make her do it again? 
 She knew I couldn't say no. 
 Franky is the family. 
 She wouldn't do that to us. 
 She doesn't give a sh1t, Doreen. 
 That's Franky. 
 You hit the ball already? 
 All right! 
 You tell Doreen? 
 Come in. 
 I worry about the other mums in here. 
 What if Franky did the same to them? 
 I know it was hard admitting it. 
 I did admire you for wanting to stay quiet. It shows you're loyal. 
 But I'm glad you told me the truth in the end. 
 You should probably tell the governor too. 
 No. 
 Jacs, I did what you asked. 
 Think of those other women. 
 Those other mothers. 
 If I lag, they'll put me in protection. 
 The easy way to make sure you stay clean. 
 No drugs in there. 
 Jacs... I can't be alone again. 
 Please... Please don't do it to me. 
 More tea? 
 Franky gave me the drugs. 
 I'm sorry, I thought you said you found them. 
 I just said that. I didn't want to get anyone into trouble. 
 But now you're accusing Franky. 
 She gave them to me. 
 So you lied about finding them? 
 It was Franky. 
 Did Jacs put you up to this? 
 Toni, you realise you'll be locked up in protection for the rest of your sentence? 
 Is that what you want? 
 What if the same thing happens again? 
 What if Franky gives the drugs to some other mother and they lose their kid like I lost mine? 
 Erm... Vera, could you please ask Mary Anne to push back my next appointment? 
 Thanks. 
 We both know that it wasn't Franky. 
 I lied. 
 No, you're lying now. 
 Prove it. 
 Franky Doyle... 
 I put my neck on the line for you. 
 And this is what you do? 
 You're charged with supplying illicit drugs to another prisoner. 
 I should have listened to Miss Davidson when she said you weren't worth the effort. Do you have anything to say? 
 No point. 
 No, you're right. 
 There's no point. 
 You're a complete waste of time and resources. Stop it. 
 Put her back in the slot for an extended stay. 
 I should have seen it. 
 Erica? 
 I know how easily the lines can blur between officers and prisoners. 
 But you've got a decision to make. 
 Are you gonna let one of them f*ck up your career or are you gonna pull your sh1t together and be the governor I know you can be? 
 Deb. Come here. 
 Oh... 
 I haven't seen you in ages. 
 Is everything OK? 
 Yeah. It's fine, I just.. 
 I haven't been around when you've called. 
 Yeah. We've been busy. 
 So what's going on? 
 I hate it here. 
 If you don't want to come in, it's OK. 
 You just talk to me on the phone, all right? 
 Yeah, whatever. 
 So is your dad looking after you? 
 Of course I am. 
 Deb? 
 I'm fine. 
 You don't look fine. 
 She's fine. 
 Yeah, well, I don't know, do I? 
 You guys are never there when I call. Well, we're here now. 
 Talk to me. 
 Dad's got a new job. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 It means he has to travel a lot. 
 Right. 
 So who's going to look after Deb? 
 I can look after myself. 
 You're 16. 
 And you're in jail. 
 So who's she hanging out with? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, she looks like sh1t. 
 You know she's been smoking? 
 Jeez, Bea, if she smokes a bit of dope, I don't blame her. 
 It's not OK if she smokes dope. 
 She's a teenager. 
 Yeah, who's gonna be left at home alone now. 
 Harry? There are women in here who have threatened Deb. 
 They know where we live. 
 Nothing's happened. 
 Not yet. 
 But you're gonna be away, aren't you? Don't start! 
 Don't ever threaten me again, like you did on the phone. 
 Yeah, well, I go insane when I don't know what's going on. 
 You wanna know what's going on? 
 Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice. 
 She's out with her mates most of the time. 
 Which is fine by me. 
 Because when she's home, all she does is give me grief. 
 God! You don't get to dump her just because it's too hard. 
 Just do something right for once. 
 You're a sh1t husband; don't be a sh1t father. Shut the f*ck up! 
 What are you gonna do? Hmm? 
 If she doesn't stop, one day she's gonna push me too far. 
 Jesus! 
 If you lay a finger on her, I'll f*cking kill you! 
 I f*cking will! 
 I swear to God, Harry! 
 We've got a code blue. 
 'I swear to God, Harry.' 
 Mum! 
 I'm good. 
 Mum! What's he done? 
 Nothing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Debbie, I'm sorry. 
 Mum! 
 Debbie? 
 What did you say? 
 Nothing! 
 Dad, you can't let them treat her like this! Calm down. 
 We have to get her out of here. 
 I'm trying. 
 Oh, bullshit! Debbie! 
 What are you gonna do? 
 OK, Debbie, you need to calm down. 
 I'm doing everything I can. 
 No, Dad, you want her to stay here. 
 Stop it, Deb! 
 Get off me! 
 These visits get a bit much for her. 
 How would you know? I'm trying to protect you from this sort of thing. 
 Now, you threatened your husband. 
 Yeah, well he's not looking after my daughter. 
 You threatened to kill him. 
 Everyone says stuff they don't mean when they're angry. 
 I didn't mean it. So you admit threatening to kill him? 
 No. No. 
 It's a criminal offence, Bea. 
 You're on remand, charged with the attempted murder of your husband. 
 I didn't do that. You attacked him. 
 That's serious intent. 
 No, no, I didn't. I'm just... 
 I'm just worried about my daughter. 
 That's all. 
 Mr Smith, do you want to make a formal complaint? 
 No, you can't. 
 No. 
 I don't want to make it any worse for my wife. 
 Fletch? Just give her a warning. 
 She should be reported, mate. 
 Come on, give her a break. 
 We can't just let it go. You know how easy it is to lose it in here. 
 It's just an expression. 
 Look, next time, we give her a box visit with her husband, OK? 
 We'll go. 
 Don't touch me. 
 That's your final warning. 
 'Hello?' 
 Er... I'm here to see Vera Bennett. 
 I'm her mother. 
 Thank you. 
 Mrs Bennett, nice to meet you. 
 I'm Linda, a friend of Vera's. 
 Really? 
 Oh, I brought her some things. 
 She didn't come home last night. 
 Oh, right, yeah, she crashed at my place. 
 Don't worry too much, we all keep some spares in our lockers. 
 I'll call her, get her to come right down. 
 'Zero-one, calling zero-three, you're wanted at reception. Over.' 
 This is zero-three. Is it urgent? 
 It's your mother. Over. 
 Yeah, copy that. Over. 
 So where did you girls get to last night? Some bar in the city. 
 We were going to go for dinner after that but we didn't make it. 
 Sounds nice. 
 Yeah, love a good girls' night. 
 Can't believe Adam finally gave Vera a leave pass. 
 Leave pass? 
 Yeah. Night away from Adam. 
 Who's Adam? 
 Her boyfriend. 
 I don't know what Vera's told you but... she's never had one. 
 She hasn't? 
 She's never had a boyfriend, she's too shy. 
 Mum, just... Just come with me, come with me. 
 Come on, this way. 
 This way, come on. 
 You've gotta keep it together, Bea. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Hey, Mr Jackson? 
 Just, thanks for standing up for me. 
 Look, I know things are tough with Debbie but you've got to look after yourself first, OK? Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Bea? 
 You be careful of him. 
 He was just being kind. 
 It's never 'just' anything. 
 There's always something. 
 You know, last time I checked, we had some tables and chairs. 
 I just want to finish this before I go home. 
 Real peace and quiet? 
 Yep. 
 You know, rumour has it you're a bit of a bullshitter. 
 My mother is... 
 I can't have friends, so I... I made up Adam. 
 Thought I'd give you the night off cooking. 
 Erm... I'm not actually that hungry. 
 Hey, you look tired. 
 It'll do you good. 
 You're all I've got. 
 I don't know what I'd do without you. 
 I'm here, Mum.
