 Rosewood : I believe that we pathologists are the ultimate champions of justice. 
 From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all for doing what you do. 
 (applause) 
 Here's the thing. 
 I hate boring speeches. I want to make this about you. 
 How about we open this up to questions, really connect, get a dialogue going. 
 Dr. Rosewood, what is the most difficult case you've ever worked, the hardest murder to solve? 
 Mm. Hmm. 
 The hardest cases for me are the mundane ones... the ones where the deaths look natural... no alarm bells. 
 In fact, it could be anyone in this room. 
 A man or woman with a heart condition who dies in their sleep, but in fact, you were murdered. 
 There's this one case, for example. 
 There was this overweight man who helped himself to a hefty amount of moo goo gai pan from an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet. 
 Next morning, his wife finds him dead from an apparent heart attack. 
 But in his trachea was a whole floret of broccoli. 
 No sign of mastication. 
 But unfortunately for the murderer, which was his wife, there is no broccoli in moo goo gai pan. 
 A little too much plum wine, he passes out. 
 She lodges broccoli down his trachea, choking him. 
 But the lack of oxygen to his brain made it look like a heart attack. 
 Here's something for you murderers out there. 
 I know there are some. 
 You? You, for sure. 
 (light laughter) 
 Atherosclerosis is your friend. 
 The hardening of the arteries is so common that very few pathologists look beyond that. 
 I can never accept missing a homicide. 
 Never, ever miss a homicide.

 (cellphone vibrating) 
 (sighs) 
 Hello? 
 What are you wearing? 
 Dr. Kincaid? 
 I was just wondering if you've been wearing your heart monitor. 
 ♪ I can still feel you ♪ 
 Uh, of course I am. 
 Always. 
 Do you think I don't know when a man's lying to me? 
 No, I think the question should be, can you tell when a man is desperately stretching the truth so he doesn't get in trouble? 
 What I know is you left town without giving me your blood work. 
 We're in the middle of this study, Rosie, and you're making it very difficult for me to do my job. 
 Well, hopefully, I'm making it intriguing, unpredictable, provocative. 
 Let's go with "frustrating." How's that? 
 Yeah, but that's frustrating in a good way, right? 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Dr. Kincaid, let me... Let me call you back. 
 You better, or else I'm gonna have to hunt you down. 
 Please stay in your room, okay? 
 Rosie, you back?! 
 Ponce de Leon, my man! 
 Hey, how's that right arm on the softball field? 
 Like a 7-year-old girl. 
 Well, you just be the best 7-year-old girl you can be. 
 Hey, what's going on over here? 
 Oh, Rosie, it's bad. 
 Dr. Wambach, room 511... maid found him lying on the floor. 
 They think he had a heart attack. 
 Okay. 
 (echoing) Here's something for you murderers out there... atherosclerosis is your friend. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm... I'm Dr. Rosewood. 
 I'm a pathologist. May I take a look? 
 Yeah. 
 In his trachea was a whole floret of broccoli. 
 Thank you. 
 Where are you... Where are you taking the body? 
 Coconut Beach coroner's office. 
 Rosie, did you know Dr. Wambach? 
 No. 
 But I've got a bad feeling we're now connected. 
 (sighs) 
 (cellphone ringing) 
 Rosie? 
 Villa, I think I killed a man. 
 What?! 
 Okay, back up. What are you talking about? 
 Okay, yesterday I gave this speech, and... and in it, I may have given the blueprint to commit the perfect murder, all right? 
 Now, this morning, a man fitting the exact scenario that I described died of a heart attack. 
 How is a heart attack murder? 
 It's not, but I don't think he died of a heart attack. 
 Okay, during a heart attack, an individual struggles. 
 He... He clings on to anything nearby. 
 This guy's sheets show no sign of being grabbed. 
 That's it? That's all you have? 
 Yes, that's all I have, and my gut. 
 Listen, I need you to come down here and help me look at this. 
 I can't. 
 Rosie, I don't have jurisdiction up there. 
 Not to mention, this could all be in your head. 
 Yes, but it's my head. 
 I have never asked you for a favor before. 
 Villa, I need you. 
 Uh, I got to hang up now. 
 Detective, you get lost on your way to your desk? 
 I wasn't... I just... ducked in for a call. 
 Cap, are you sleeping on your couch? 
 No, I'm not sleeping on my couch. 
 I know a couch sleeper when I see one. 
 That was me for a while. 
 A guy can't rest his brain box to think for two seconds? 
 What you palming there? 
 Had the lox and shmear this morning. 
 What gives? 
 Cap, I need the day. Uh, something's come up. 
 What's come up? Tell you what, I won't ask you why you're sleeping on your couch, and you don't ask me what's come up. 
 What are you still doing standing here? 
 Keep your ringer on in case the caca hits the fan. 
 (cellphone chimes) 
 Mwah. 
 (gasps) 
 (laughs) 
 What, I startled you with my little sugar? 
 No, I'm just thinking about Rosie. I just hope he's okay. 
 Whoa, where's your... Where's your badge? 
 And no tank top? That's new. 
 I... 
 And the wedges. Wow. 
 Daisy Duke just... 
 I am out of my jurisdiction. 
 (as Hoke) I'm trying to drive you to the store, Ms. Daisy. 
 (normal voice) I always wanted to say that. 
 How about a, "Thank you, Villa, for making the drive"? 
 Okay, I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge right now. 
 So, thank you, Villa. It means a lot that you're here. 
 Let's just do the thing we do. 
 I know. I know. There's this... 
 Dr. Damski, how you doing? 
 I'm Dr. Beaumont Rosewood Jr. 
 I gave the keynote speech last night at FOPAC. 
 Oh, good for you. Your mother must be very proud. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Um, I believe the body in there, Dr. Wambach, was murdered based on something I said. 
 Actually, it was coronary atherosclerosis. 
 Yeah, see, that is exactly what I presented. 
 I need to see that body. 
 My friend here... he can get a little excited. 
 But his hunches are spot-on. 
 I can vouch for him. I'm a homicide detective. 
 (chuckling) Right. You're a cop. 
 Detective Villa, East Miami P.D. 
 I see. Well, uh, Detective Villa, is it? 
 I-I'm not sure my captain's gonna be too pleased that an outsider cop and old Ludwig Van Autopsy here are snooping around in his county. 
 Beaumont... 
 I am not here in that capacity. 
 I just came to see a friend and visit the sites here in Coconut Beach. 
 Hey, is it true that there's a place where you can wrestle alligators? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay, thank you. Just... 
 Wrestle alligators? What... What are you doing? 
 I could have convinced him. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Convinced him what... to get you arrested and me fired? 
 Villa, no, you don't understand, okay? 
 I need to see that body. 
 I do understand, Rosie, and I am with you. 
 Okay? I'm literally with you at some random M.E.'s office. 
 We'll do this thing. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yeah, Rosie, look, I love you, but I'd get fired for even having you in this room. 
 Okay, listen, Ponce, I'm gonna confide in you, okay? 
 Annalise isn't just my friend. 
 She's a homicide detective from the East Miami Police Department. 
 So, the hot chick is a cop? 
 Yes, and this "hot chick" can use just these two fingers to hog-tie you right on this carpet... ass-up, if you want to see. 
 Sold! Y un poquito turned on. 
 It could be any one of these people. 
 What are we supposed to do... go around the hotel tapping them on the shoulder, asking them if they murdered someone last night? 
 Hey, what about... What about Poe over there in the turtleneck? 
 At the very least, he's got a doll of his mother in a rocking chair at home. 
 Ponce, tell me you don't have a doll of your mother at home. 
 Can we see the... the footage from the hallways? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mm. 
 Pathologists hooking up with pathologists. 
 Not a show I want to see. 
 You can say what you want, but we know our way around the body. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Stop right there. 
 Who's that leaving Dr. Wambach's room? 
 She looks guilty of something. 
 That's Suzie Q. 
 She's a... friend to a lot of guys who stay here. 
 So the last person seen leaving Dr. Wambach's room was an escort. 
 That's a good place to start. 
 Okay, can you... Can you get us a list of everyone who's attending this thing? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We got 40 hours till this convention wraps up and our killer disappears. 
 Ponce : Hey, guys... let's solve a murder! 
 Okay, this is you. 
 This door right here leads right to Rosie's suite. 
 That way, you guys can pow-wow, huh? 
 No, no, no, no, no. I'm not... I'm not staying in this room. Not a chance. 
 Look, Villa, Villa, you got to stay somewhere. 
 I'm not gonna have you stay on the streets. 
 Stunning, right? 
 Man, it's too bad you guys aren't celebrating anything. 
 Well, with the lack of leads and no help from local P.D., I doubt we'll be spending much time in here anyway. 
 Ponce, is there any chance you can track down one more available room? 
 (inhales sharply) 
 It's over with Martha. 
 She kicked me out. 
 Ohh. When did this go down? 
 A week ago. 
 I didn't want to put anybody out. 
 Never stayed in a hotel alone. 
 All those long hallways going places I don't know. 
 Like Redrum City. 
 Please, we're brothers. 
 The guest bed in my trailer is yours for as long as you need it. 
 I mean, right now it's a table, but at night, doubles as a bed. 
 (cellphone rings) 
 Villa? 
 Wait, slow down. Slow down. 
 I thought you were taking the day off. 
 Yeah, so did I, but something always seems to come up. 
 Pipp, what do you got for me? 
 Stanley Wambach has had two heart procedures in the past six years. 
 One was a triple bypass, the other a stent placement. 
 You're telling me you guys are going rogue down there, old-school style? 
 Look, I'm just wondering if you can spare a body or two for extra hands. 
 Feldheim, maybe? We got a free room. 
 I'll do it. 
 No, Cap, I didn't mean you. 
 This is personal to Rosie, right? 
 I haven't seen him like this before. 
 Rosie, this doesn't fall on you. 
 Yeah, I know, Pipp, but I got to do what I got to do.

 Hey, Cap, thanks for making the trip. 
 No, Rosie, you called. We're all here. 
 Wood-man, long trip. 
 You mind if I partake in these macadamia nuts? 
 Hey, Butters, walk away from the nuts. 
 Why'd you bring him? 
 We were having a gentlemen's weekend. 
 Really? How does Martha feel about that? 
 Well, she's... got her own stuff to do. 
 She ended things. Been a week. 
 Why don't you pull the shiv out of my back? 
 You know I'm not great at keeping secrets. 
 Really? 
 Cap. 
 Why didn't you tell me anything? 
 Villa, look, let's just focus. What do you got? 
 Okay, these are our suspects, but we got a couple that seem like standouts. 
 So he was taking notes during my speech like he was studying for a murder test. 
 Isn't registered as an attendee of the conference, but checked in to the hotel under the name "Antonius Block." 
 Nothing showed up on a search. 
 Suspect "B"... 
 Call girl. One-night wife. 
 What? (clears throat) 
 Got an eye for these things. 
 She was the last person to leave the victim's room, so she must know something. 
 Rosie and I will pay a visit to Mr. Block. 
 And Ira and I will pull an O'Bannon on the hooker. 
 Both : What's an O'Bannon? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Rosewood : Thank you for seeing us, Dr. Block. 
 Anything for the great Dr. Rosewood. 
 And, um... 
 My assistant, Juanesta. 
 Juanesta? Really? 
 Then you know all about molar gate back in '09. 
 Yes, she does. I solved that case when all I had to work with was a single tooth. 
 I got lucky. 
 No, that's skill. 
 The same skill used to find that piece of unchewed broccoli in that fat man's trach. 
 I have to admit that I'm... I'm flattered. 
 But actually, I'm here for your help. 
 Juanesta and I were looking into Dr. Wambach's death from last night. 
 'Twas a shame. 
 Let me ask you, doctor, did you see the body? 
 Did you get to touch it? 
 Can you describe in glorious detail exactly what it felt like? 
 Did the skin have a scent, a dermatological musk, if you will? 
 I-I-I'm sorry. How long have you been a pathologist? 
 (clatter) 
 (gasps) What is this? 
 Douglas, what's going on? Who are these people? 
 Mother, don't call me Douglas! 
 I'm going by Antonius Block! 
 Max von Sydow's character from The Seventh Seal, who played chess with death. 
 Enough with that nonsense. No one's seen that movie. 
 It's a dead reference! 
 That's why I like it. 
 You're not a pathologist. 
 I'm just a really big fan. 
 Could you sign this? 
 "To Antonius, my deathly best friend, formaldehyde-ly yours, Rosie." 
 Wouldn't your hand get bigger, too? 
 (laughter) 
 You guys are so much fun. 
 What do you say we go back to one of your rooms and keep this party going? 
 Yeah, let's do this! 
 Forget it. Another time. 
 The truth is, your friend from last night, Dr. Wambach... 
 How did you know I was with him? 
 He's a very dear friend. 
 May he rest. 
 Wait, he's dead? 
 Yeah, fell asleep and never woke up. 
 Poor b*st*rd. He was one of a kind. 
 He was a purple unicorn amongst a sea of Clydesdales. 
 That he was. 
 How did you two know him? 
 Harvard Med. 
 Oklahoma Med. Go, Muskrats. 
 You're doctors? 
 We can't all be McDreamy, lady. 
 (laughs) We can't all be McDreamy. 
 The thing is Wambach was... was... was the kind of guy who kept such a close watch on his health. 
 Wait, you... You think I hurt him? 
 Never. 
 I just know that the only person who I confess to more than my priest is my, uh, companion. 
 I'm just hoping maybe he talked to you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh, please don't go. 
 This man was my best friend. 
 We were walking through life together. 
 The birth of my son Rico, the... the anniversaries, the... the good, the bad, the whole nine. 
 I loved him. 
 I thought he would always be a part of my life. 
 Are you sure you were just friends? 
 Please, a-anything that you can think of, any little detail that he told you could be important. 
 Oh, he did talk a lot about another doctor... a guy that worked under him at Pelican Bay. 
 Kip or Kipling. 
 Kipley Reed. Does that sound like it? 
 Yeah, that's him. 
 They hated each other. 
 Once or twice, they almost came to blows. 
 This Kip guy wanted him gone. 
 Thank you.

 But I was looking at her. 
 You know, it was that... that face that was perhaps the most alarmingly beautiful face that I had ever seen. 
 Kip : Wow. 
 And it kept alternating from... from delicate and captivating one second to scrunched-up and intense the next. 
 It was like she was fighting not just that bag, but something bigger. 
 Something inside of her. 
 And I didn't know it at the time, but my life was never gonna be the same. 
 So the day that I proposed to Annalise, she was meeting me on a weekend away, and she came around this corner wearing a pair of blue-Jean shorts, a white T-shirt, and a hat. 
 And it was an outfit so simple, so nondescript. 
 But the way she wore it... 
 The way she wore it, it was like it was designed just for her. 
 Then I knew. 
 I realized that she showed up not for a vacation, not out of obligation, but for me. 
 She was there for me. 
 And just at that moment, the Rihanna song "Stay" came on the radio. 
 (chuckles) 
 And so I took her hand in mine, and I'm not really a Jumbotron kind of guy, but I do believe that the... the smallest moments have the potential to be the biggest. 
 And it was in that exact moment that I realized this whole time that I thought I was gonna be saving her... it was she that was saving me. 
 (cellphone vibrates) 
 I'm so sorry. 
 This has been so much fun, but I think I got too much sun today. 
 I'm suddenly so tired. 
 Yeah. 
 Huh. 
 Hmm. 
 So, uh, Dr. Kip is out? 
 Well, yeah, I mean, you know, I thought we had him there. 
 Bitter rivals. He wants Wambach gone. 
 Yeah, but Cap finds out he accepted some big offer from an M.E. office out of Portland three months ago. 
 Yeah, I guess it's not much of a motive to have him killed, then, is it? 
 (sighs) 
 Now with no concrete evidence, I'm never getting a chance to see that body. 
 Rosie, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. 
 I feel like I let you down here. 
 Oh, no, you, um... you didn't let me down. 
 Maybe we get some sleep and, uh, regroup in the morning. 
 Yeah. Right. 
 Let's do that. 
 See you in the morning. 
 Yeah, see you... in the morning. 
 I just feel like... 
 It's been a weird weekend for me. 
 Me too. It's, uh... 
 You, um... maybe you want to pop in for a second, take a look at the original suspect list? 
 This weekend would have been me and Eddie's wedding anniversary. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. 
 I don't know why I told you that. 
 The hotel... everything's so... 
 Are you okay... being alone tonight? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll be fine. 
 (sighs) 
 Oh, you know what? 
 No. 
 That actually happens a lot. 
 No, I got it. It's... 
 I got it. I got it. 
 (lock beeps) 
 (chuckles) Now I feel silly. 
 No, I just have the magic touch. 
 Yeah, I guess you do. 
 Magic touch. 
 I should... I... See you in the morning, Rosie. 
 Well, now we got bupkis. 
 What's our next move? 
 "Helsingborg Pancake"? 
 No. 
 You're right. Too precious. 
 We go seps on a London double decker and... 
 Enough! There's nothing else! You got it? 
 You know, Floyd, this whole thing with you has been fun, but it's not me anymore. 
 I can't move backwards. 
 What, are you saying being with me is going backwards? 
 I'm looking at the slash. 
 You know when you're counting, "one, two, three, four, slash." 
 Divorce numero five. 
 Oh, so Martha left you because of who I am. 
 Because of what we do... well, that's rich. 
 I'm a grown man laying across from a guy in pajamas, tops and bottoms, who lives alone in an airstream. 
 I moved forward. 
 You stayed the same. 
 Well, from here, it looks the opposite, pal.

 No, no, no. Don't. 
 Last night was one of the best make-out sessions of the last decade. 
 And besides, clearly, you have other things on your mind. 
 Let me explain. 
 No, no, no, no. I'm not upset. 
 I drive a convertible. 
 So I have a beautiful ride ahead of me. 
 Plus, I know we're gonna sleep together. 
 Is that right? 
 Yep. 
 And I'm enjoying the wait. 
 Till then... 
 Doctor. 
 Doctor. 
 Are you watching me? 
 Good. 
 Excuse me. Um, the woman that was in this room... 
 The pretty lady? 
 She checked out earlier this morning. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Hey, you were out of there bright and early this morning. 
 Don't even say goodbye? 
 Sorry. I... I couldn't sleep. 
 Figured I'd beat the traffic. 
 Did you sleep okay? 
 You know what? I don't... I don't need to know. 
 Look, Villa, thanks for trying. 
 And I know it was an impossible undertaking, but it means a lot that you came along for the ride. 
 Ride's not over yet. 
 Oh, come on, Villa. 
 We've already looked at that too many times to count. 
 We looked at the party footage, but we didn't take it back to the afternoon. 
 Look, our friend Suzie Q. There. 
 Look who she's meeting with. 
 I guess we weren't that far off, after all. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Not my usual clientele, but I'm down. 
 Unfortunately, sweetie, this isn't a party. 
 I'm actually here on official business. 
 You're a cop. 
 Sit it down. 
 I didn't do anything wrong. 
 You can't arrest me. 
 Well, why don't you let me decide that? 
 Turns out this hotel has lots of cameras pointed in all sorts of directions. 
 And one of those cameras picked up an interesting conversation between you and one of the guests the day Wambach died. 
 Now, you don't have to tell me anything, but I have a pretty good idea of what happened. 
 The problem is, in my version, you're going away for a long time. 
 All I did was get the guy drunk. 
 Hey, Melvin. 
 Oh, you're calling the mayor to get me one of those big keys? 
 They usually give those out to people who do good in the community. 
 And now that I have proof that Dr. Wambach was murdered... 
 Hi. Can I speak to Captain Wyatt, please? 
 Sure, Doris. I'll hold. 
 What are you doing? 
 Well, you know what's great about being the best pathologist in Miami? 
 Connections! 
 Oh, yeah, I got the reporters, journalists. 
 Actually, it's too many of them. 
 You're gonna report me? 
 Oh, no, no. I'm just calling to invite them to hang out with us, you know? 
 Shoot the stuff. (chuckles) 
 Yeah, in about 30 minutes, this whole lobby will be flooded with press. 
 And it's funny because you don't strike me as somebody who does well under the bright lights. 
 Obstruction of justice. 
 That's gonna follow you for the rest of your life. 
 (cellphone beeps) 
 Oh, please. 
 You think I didn't check the trachea? 
 Not well enough. 
 Oh, and, by the way, I don't really know any reporters. 
 Kip : Yep. 
 Hey, hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Rosie, what are you doing here? 
 I had to say goodbye to our new friends. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What do you mean, "goodbye"? 
 There's no goodbye. I was gonna friend you when we got home. 
 Home. Home. See, you know what? 
 That's actually what I love about this place. 
 It really makes you feel like you... like you live here, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 But I don't have this at home. 
 This mini bar... This mini bar is incredible. 
 Look, got Mashuga Nuts for days. 
 Got these... these cool-looking ice-cube trays. 
 You know, people don't respect a cold drink anymore. 
 Everything's at room temperature, room temperature. 
 That's all the rage. That's not an option for me. 
 Mnh-mnh. I need ice. 
 Ice, ice, baby. 
 Yeah. Weird how much you like ice. 
 No, no, I don't like ice. I love ice. 
 Yeah, and these things are... They're so small. 
 You know, they can actually fit into a water bottle. 
 2.8 centimeters... all four sides. 
 A perfect cube. 
 Is he always like this? 
 It's why I married him. 
 Ah, Mooney, you're so sweet. 
 And guess how wide Dr. Wambach's trachea is. 
 It's exactly 2.4 centimeters. 
 Just big enough to fit a 2.8 cube in there for it to get stuck before it melts. 
 Rosie, what are you talking about? 
 Then you paid a call girl to get him nice and passed out. 
 She leaves the sliding door open, which makes it easy to get into the room undetected. 
 It's really odd how close these balconies are. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Why would I do that? 
 I'm about to be head medical examiner at the Portland M.E.'s office. 
 Oh, I didn't... I didn't say you did anything. 
 Right, Casey? 
 Casey, what's she talking about? 
 All my friends are here. 
 My family. 
 I-It's the only place I've ever known. 
 I waited five years for you to get that promotion, and it never happened. 
 I wasn't gonna move to Portland. 
 How... How did you even know how... 
 She heard what I said about the broccoli, then she decided to do me one better and use the ice so it couldn't be found in the trachea. 
 But, unfortunately for you, Casey, at 32 degrees, ice leaves a tiny abrasive scarring on the tissue. 
 And it was only a matter of time till he figured it out because Rosie... he's... He's like a dog with a bone. 
 That's what makes him so amazing. 
 He'll never, ever miss a homicide. 
 Ever. 
 Look what I found in the suitcase. 
 This broad was killing your boss with or without Rosie's help. 
 Okay, kitten, where were you headed, the pool? 
 Oh, and, by the way, Annalise isn't my wife. 
 She's a detective. 
 Casey Reed, you're under arrest for the murder of Dr. Stanley Wambach. 
 (handcuffs click) 
 She's good. 
 (knock on door) 
 Captain, just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me this weekend... flimming and the flamming, et cetera, et cetera. 
 You know, Rosie, I made four proposals in my life. 
 When I got on a knee and I looked up at Martha, I mean, we were in church, no less. 
 You go to church? 
 No, it was a funeral, but I-I really believed what I was saying. 
 I had hope, faith, whatever you want to call it. 
 And the real kick in the shorts is I actually thought the best thing I was gonna do in this life was to have a world-class relationship. 
 Go figure. 
 Cap, you still have your whole big, long life ahead of you. 
 You know, I kept all these rings as a reminder that this one was gonna be different. 
 But look at them. 
 They're all the same, each and every one of them. 
 (knock on door) 
 Hey, Ira. 
 Uh, well, listen, I'm gonna let you two talk. 
 Ira, I got issues. 
 Um, when things went sideways with Joyce, I gave up. 
 I never tried again. 
 You're different. 
 You're a fighter. 
 This weekend, back in the saddle with you was the best time I've had in forever, but I'm not gonna stand in your way. 
 I'll keep my distance, so... 
 That's it. 
 Floyd. 
 You realize you and me is the longest relationship I had in my life? 
 You're my brother. 
 You're not going anywhere. 
 Really? Yeah. 
 Great. 
 'Cause I was bluffing. 
 You tried to pull a "McNamara Chew" on me? 
 I invented the Chew. 
 You just fell for the Chew. 
 Oh, really? 
 Erica : Last-minute lunch invite, fresh blackberry scones? 
 Well, everything in my apartment is fresh. 
 Hmm. Is that so? 
 That is so. 
 Well, usually, I insist on a taste test. 
 Is this right? 
 I mean, I love having you as my doctor. 
 Good. 
 And I love sitting here on this couch with you. 
 Perfect. 
 But I'm just not sure that they can or should coexist. 
 Rosie, we are both intelligent adults. 
 I can handle both sides of my brain, and I know you can, too. 
 (knock on door) 
 Excuse me. 
 (sighs) 
 Hey, Rosie, I... 
 Hey. 
 Oh. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't know I was interrupting. 
 No, no, you didn't. 
 No, no, no. I was just getting up. 
 Again, enjoyed the hotel. 
 Well worth the drive. 
 He's all yours. 
 (sighs) 
 Rosie, I-I owe you an explanation. 
 I didn't take off just because I couldn't sleep. 
 Yeah, no, no. I-I get it. 
 It was a... It was a complicated weekend. 
 Exactly, and I'll be the first one to admit that I don't always understand what I'm feeling... in the moment. 
 Yeah, but that's natural 'cause you had the anniversary and then Eddie. 
 No, it wasn't about Eddie. 
 It was about... 
 I didn't sleep with Erica. 
 That's... I don't need to know... 
 And the reason why I didn't sleep with her... is because I was thinking about... 
 Hey, you don't owe me any explanations, okay? 
 I... You can live your life however you please. 
 So... 
 No, yeah, right. I know. 
 I know. I know. 
 Hey, you know, we, uh... 
 We did a great job this weekend. 
 We... We did. Yeah. (chuckles) 
 And that hotel... whoo. 
 That hotel was... well worth the drive. 
 But now I'll let you go. 
 Enjoy your... fruit. 
 I just have one question. 
 When you go undercover, you really commit. 
 I mean, that speech... the whole proposal at the restaurant. 
 Wow. 
 What was your question? 
 I guess I'm just wondering if... you're a really good actor or... 
 (Rihanna's "Stay" plays) 
 Hey. 
 I can pull off the Wilmette, Illinois, Screamer like the best of them.
