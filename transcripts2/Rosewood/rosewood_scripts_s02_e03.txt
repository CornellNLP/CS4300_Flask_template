 Previously on "Rosewood".. 
 Your husband died, didn't he? What happened to him? 
 Pizza, movie, bed... that was our Sunday routine. 
 The next morning, he kissed me goodbye and collapsed. 
 Wait, I have to tell you something. 
 I don't think Eddie died of natural causes. 
 You think I missed my own husband's murder? 
 Rosie, I'm sorry. 
 You were right about everything. 
 Eddie isn't who I... I thought he was. 
 All evidence points to him being involved in something criminal. 
 Sometimes you have to ignore what the evidence says and trust your gut. 
 What you and Eddie had was special. 
 He deserves the benefit of the doubt. 
 I'm really ready to do this. 
 ­I'm glad to hear you say that. 
 I just put in a request to have Eddie's body exhumed.

 Sorry. I got stuck in a little traffic. 
 I'll give you as much time here as you need with him. 
 I don't think I can do this. 
 I don't want to see him. 
 Not this way. 
 Wait upstairs. 
 I'll call you when I'm done. 
 8:35 a.m. October 6, 2016. 
 Beginning the autopsy on the exhumed body of Edward Horatio Lunez. 
 Okay, so, this is one of those situations they don't teach you about in forensics school. 
 We'll do the same thing we always do. 
 We'll give it our all.

 What? Talk. Did you find something? 
 It's what I didn't find. 
 His liver... It's missing. 
 Question is, is it missing accidentally or on purpose? 
 So, what do we do? 
 Call New York, hammer the doc for info? 
 No, not an option. 
 He's dead. 
 Suspected suicide about a week ago. 
 Coincidence? 
 We need to get on a plane. 
 Cap, this for real, or are you yanking my chain here? 
 I don't yank other men's chains, Ira. 
 You want on a case with me or not? 
 I do. I'm just wondering what are we doing in a fashion mall. 
 Well, I got a tip about a girl who might have some pertinent info. 
 But, hey, man, if this all goes well while we're here, maybe Daddy buys you some new duds that don't shout "cop." 
 So let me get this straight... We're looking for a prostitute? 
 Not just a prostitute, Ira... A ring of prostitutes. 
 A ring? 
 A ring. 
 Catering to the uber-rich in our fair city. 
 Since when are a couple of hookers top priority for the new captain of the department? 
 Can I help you two with something? 
 Yes, you can. 
 Um, I'm looking for a scent. 
 You mind taking me in? 
 Oh. 
 Tell me what you think works with my natural pheromones. 
 Really? 
 Mmm! 
 I'd say something manly, woodsy... maybe with a hint of flannel? 
 Mm. Well, you are good. 
 Yeah. 
 What about my buddy here? 
 What do you think? Something cupcake-y? 
 I don't know. Give him a smell. 
 Look, I'm okay not being smelled. 
 Look, we don't have a lot of time, so I'm not interested in the little wink-and-smile game you're playing. 
 A birdie told me maybe you and your friends know of a little­money-for-the-honey arrangement? 
 I-I don't know what that is. 
 Cash-for-flash? 
 You pay me, I make Johnny Businessman very happy? 
 Would you rather hand out flannel samples to everybody at the booking department? 
 Start talking. 
 Is he serious? 
 I believe so. 
 Sweetie, what do you think we do for a living? We're cops. 
 I'm the captain. He used to be the captain. 
 Yeah, that makes total sense on him. 
 Yeah. 
 But you... I thought you were a model. 
 [Scoffs] Wow. 
 I may or may not have posed for a department calendar in the past. 
 [Laughs] Enough. 
 Look, a sweet girl like you doesn't need a sex-worker charge on her record, okay? 
 So you steer us in the right direction, maybe we forget your name. 
 I went once with a friend, and all I did was talk to some guys. 
 The Herschel Club in Brickell. 
 Slade : Thanks for that. 
 Thank you for that cologne tip. 
 Do flannel. Got it. 
 ­Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
 Anytime. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Chuckles] Wow. Nice work, Ira. 
 I mean, your style's a little rough-and-tumble, but I like it. 
 I get it done. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 Looks like you and I have a date tonight at the Herschel Club. 
 All due respect, I want to be polite, okay, mind our ranks and such, but I think you got it covered from here, right? 
 All due respect, you're coming. 
 Yeah! 
 [Tone rings] 
 [Indistinct public address] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, man. 
 You're gonna look so good in a snorkel mask. 
 I won't be able to resist. 
 I told you I am not going scuba diving, okay? 
 I'll look at fish on my plate... Next to some mango salsa. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But I want to make it through this honeymoon alive, okay? 
 Okay, Lissie. 
 Will you at least wear the mask for me in the bedroom? 
 Come on. 
 Are you crazy? 
 Ah, the new Mr. and Mrs. Lunez. 
 Can I get either of you something? 
 Um, actually, um, you wouldn't happen to have a snorkel mask back there, would you? 
 [Laughter] 
 [Coughing] You okay? 
 Eddie? Eddie? 
 [Coughing continues] 
 Help! Help! 
 Somebody help! He's choking! 
 Help! Please! 
 Please! Help! 
 Somebody, help! He's choking! 
 [Tone rings] Dear? Are you okay? 
 Do you get jittery while you're flying? 
 Um, I'm fine. I'm... I'm... 
 I just... I'm fine. 
 So, you couldn't wait up, huh? 
 I guess you didn't realize that guys with multiple open-heart surgeries can't go through the x-rays. 
 That TSA agent got a little handsy. 
 Rosie, thank you for doing this. 
 I know your plate is... 
 Empty... for you. 
 We got this. [Tone rings] 
 Did you figure out what those pictures were from Eddie's camera? 
 No, but I think we're gonna find out.

 Hey, you okay? 
 I'm cake. I'm worried about you. 
 Me? 
 Yeah, this is my old stomping ground. 
 I'm not sure if you're cut out for the mean streets of New York City. 
 Oh, come on. I can be plenty mean. 
 Is that right? 
 Oh, that is... right. 
 What are you doing? 
 It's my mean face. 
 That face says "mug me." 
 You don't know. 
 But seriously, hang on to those pocket squares. 
 Someone's gonna mug you. 
 And keep up. We walk faster here in New York. 
 Hey, so, do you know this Captain Murillo we're meeting with? 
 He wasn't here when I was, but I wouldn't be looking for any hugs. 
 Yeah, I don't just hug everybody, okay? 
 You should know that. 
 Captain Murillo. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 So, uh, how can I help you two? 
 I'm Dr. Beaumont Rosewood. 
 I'm a pathologist in Miami, and this is Detective Villa. 
 She actually used to work... 
 Yeah, in the 118. I know your name. 
 We're a little concerned about the timing of the suicide of your M.E... Dr. Jamal. 
 Hmm. 
 I don't have to tell you the stress on an M.E. in New York City. 
 This ain't Miami. 
 But we believe his death is connected to an investigation we're working. 
 And what investigation is that? 
 My former husband... Eddie Lunez. 
 Have sympathy for you, detective, and for your loss, but as far as the death of your husband, it wasn't a murder, and it wasn't an investigation here. 
 Well, we believe that... 
 Beliefs and 7 bucks will get you a cup of coffee in this town. 
 Normally, I'd have an officer escort you back to the airport, but, uh, you're one of us. 
 You're blue. 
 So I'm gonna suggest you two get a slice, then jump back on a plane. 
 Rosewood : So, we cabbing back to the airport? 
 Hell no. 
 That's exactly what I was hoping you were gonna say. 
 You know, the guy had a bad attitude and a dead M.E. 
 That's more than enough reason to double down. 
 That's what I was hoping you were gonna say. 
 Where do we start? 
 Eddie. We start turning over stones. 
 Yeah, I think it's time I got to know who he really was. 
 Hey! 
 S02E03 - Eddie and the Empire State of Mind 
 [School bell rings] 
 Listen, your husband, Eddie... He was an incredible person. 
 Thanks. That's... that's sweet. 
 But I don't need to hear the "Teacher of the Year" speech. 
 I want the other stuff... The Eddie juice, the real story. 
 Villa, this isn't an interrogation. 
 Maybe it should be. 
 Or maybe it shouldn't be. I think the principal is just... 
 Lying? 
 Yeah. See, thing is, I did my homework. 
 There was a three-week period... February 2014... 
 Eddie was making deposits, but they weren't from this school. 
 They weren't from you. 
 Why weren't you paying him? 
 I don't think I like the implications... or the tone. 
 Oh, no? Not a fan? Ouch. 
 Well, then you're gonna hate this part. 
 I don't know what this is, but I can call security right now. 
 Really? 
 The little private-school guys with the blue short-sleeved shirts? 
 Go ahead. Call them. Call them right now. 
 Nuh-huh. No, no, no, no, no. They're not gonna do anything. 
 Let's see them. I have all day. I don't... I don't think... 
 No, no, no, I don't think we need to call the blue short-sleeved guys. 
 Nah, not today. We're good. 
 Look, he got into a fight. 
 He lost it on another member of the faculty. 
 Eddie? With who? 
 With me. Fist to my jaw. 
 Fastest hook I never saw. 
 Why would he do that? 
 Who knows? Who cares? 
 It was about a kid... A student. 
 Oliver Jacott. 
 He was being picked on, and Eddie was mad that I couldn't do more about it. 
 Board wanted me to fire him. 
 I did him a favor and swept it under the rug, but I had to suspend him for three weeks without pay. 
 Well, maybe you should have done more to help the kid. 
 Boys can be cruel. 
 Survival of the fittest. 
 Right, doctor? 
 Me? 
 I spent most of my freshman year in a hospital bed. 
 Almost didn't survive. 
 I'm here now, though. 
 We need to talk to that kid. 
 Oliver Jacott? 
 Mrs. Lunez. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Uh, Mr. Lunez was my teacher. 
 He had a photo of you he would keep on his desk. 
 He was more than just a teacher to me. 
 You mean like a big brother? 
 More like a dad. 
 [Echoing] More like a dad. 
 How amazing would it be to have a little Lunez running around here? 
 Your stubbornness... my hair. 
 Don't you want that, too? 
 Of course I want that. 
 I don't know if it's obvious, but I don't really fit in here, and he defended me. 
 You mean against Principal Garrity? 
 I saw the whole throwdown. 
 Then after, I wasn't allowed to talk to Mr. Lunez anymore. 
 Man : Oliver! 
 That's my dad. 
 Rosewood : So, Principal Garrity... 
 Should we crack open his world, see what runs out? 
 Not yet. 
 I want to keep digging first, and I just thought of another stone I have to turn. 
 Let's turn and burn. 
 No. I got to do this one myself. 
 It's personal. 
 Villa : Anthony. Thanks for coming. 
 Yeah, of course. Uh, so good to see you. 
 W-What are you doing in New York? 
 Just had a couple days off. 
 I love to feed the ducks. 
 Ducks, huh? 
 [Sighs] Listen, I-I should have been more... 
 Hey, hey, I get it. 
 You were his best friend, not mine. 
 You know what? Screw it. 
 I'm not great ­at the touchy-feely small talk. 
 Eddie lied to me. 
 And so did you. 
 There was no car accident. 
 You covered for him. 
 So what really happened? 
 Annalise, I don't know what you're... 
 This goes one of two ways. 
 You can start being honest with me, and this can be a nice reunion with two old friends on a park bench, or you know me, and you know I don't dick around. 
 So... 
 What do you need to know? 
 Eddie didn't die from an embolism. 
 He was murdered. 
 Listen, I-I never wanted to lie for him, okay? 
 I don't know what was going on. 
 I just know that he was really afraid and really scared. 
 Of what? 
 I don't know. 
 He kept saying something about a-a Rico. 
 Rico who? 
 I don't know, Annalise. 
 I don't. I don't. 
 The car... What happened to it? 
 I still got it. 
 Figured it was the, uh... last piece of him I could hang on to, so... 
 [Sighs] 
 I've never seen any of this stuff. 
 [Sniffs] 
 I'm gonna take these with me. 
 Eddie's old mints? 
 Have at it. 
 Serial numbers are filed off. 
 Eddie had a gun? 
 Tee, I need to get eyes on that body again. 
 And I need you to do some tests for me. 
 Rosie, are you kidding me? I'm all alone here. 
 Mitchie's in Pensacola, doing something most likely illegal and for sure super-weird. 
 So, no, I can't... I can't do it by myself. 
 This isn't a request. This isn't a favor. 
 This is... just what it is. I'll be there every step. 
 So put your big-girl pants on, get started, and call me in an hour. 
 ♪ Ohhhhhh ♪ 
♪ Ohhhhhh ♪ 
 Yes! That's it! That's totally it! 
 Tara?! Hold on. 
 Tara? What? 
 What's... What's going on? 
 [Sighs] Pipp, I need your help. 
 ♪ Throw it up if you feel me ♪ 
♪ Manhattan, Staten Island, keep it happening ♪ 
 You know, I tried to follow up on the name Rico that Eddie kept mentioning, and talk about needles and haystacks. 
 There are 32,000 Ricos in the Manhattan area alone. 
 Yeah, I didn't want to say anything before, but based on a metallic aroma from those mints we got from Eddie's car, I did a preliminary tox screen. 
 Okay, how and where could you have possibly done that? 
 Come on, Villa. 
 Private pathologists always travel with a spare white dress shirt and a chem-screen kit. 
 Let's just say my hotel room happened to have coffee filters, carbonated water, and a sewing needle. 
 Okay, so, what did you find? 
 Well, they weren't mints. 
 Whatever was in that tin had properties similar to those found in steroids. 
 Wait... Eddie was juicing? 
 Rosewood : So, how'd you get us here? 
 Villa : I knew every t-shirt in Eddie's closet. 
 This wasn't one of them. 
 So I did some recon on the logo. 
 He was here. 
 Sweetheart, you mind bringing us back a couple 1942 Viniq? 
 Sure. 
 Oh, and maybe a friend to join us, too. 
 You got it. 
 I don't want another drink. 
 I don't want a friend coming over. 
 You got it? 
 Man, for a guy who's been married four times, you seem pretty wound up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, when the girls come back, just... take yours wherever, all right? 
 Do your thing. 
 I see nothing. 
 Hell, I'll even pay for it. 
 What are we doing here? Huh? 
 This ridiculous inve... 
 You don't even care about a couple of old guys getting their jollies. 
 You're right. I don't. Not even a little. 
 I'm just trying to get to know you, Ira. 
 Getting to know me or getting to know my weaknesses? 
 Eddie always did his own thing, running along the East River, occasionally going to the local YMCA for a pickup basketball game, but I had no idea he ever set foot inside this place. 
 Hey, boss, you remember a guy named Eddie Lunez? 
 He used to come in here around two years ago. 
 Nope. 
 Okay, let me try that again. 
 I'm Detective Annalise Villa, East Miami P.D. 
 Did you know Eddie Lunez? 
 This ain't no place for no cops or broads, especially ones without juri-diction to come around here asking no questions. 
 Is it a place for doctors with disciplined right hooks? 
 You know a Rico? 
 Maybe he's a cat that works here. 
 Bennie! What the hell are you looking at? 
 Since you can't box no more, get busy with those spit buckets! 
 And I got nothing else to say to you. 
 How 'bout you, slick? 
 You recognize him? 
 Hey, bro, no disrespect... Your girl fine, but I'm in the middle of something here. 
 So you can step back and watch, get turned on. 
 I'm cool with that. 
 Otherwise... 
 Listen. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 The guy in the picture... He's dead. 
 So any help jogging your memory would be appreciated. 
 Please. 
 Too bad. So sad. 
 People die. 
 Okay, okay. Hey, hey. 
 She crazy! 
 You got to protect yourself at all times, right? 
 Otherwise, you open yourself up to all kinds of trouble. 
 I am not done here. 
 No, you... You are done. 
 Hey, that's right! Run away! 
 That's probably what that dead guy did to get away from your ass! 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 [Chuckles] My man, sorry about my friend. 
 She meant no disrespect... Really. 
 I apologize. Bring it in? 
 That dead guy was my partner's husband. 
 He loved her. She loved him. 
 It's the kind of love that I'm sure you will never know in your days. 
 I've opened up a lot of bodies in my lifetime, and I've never taken pleasure from it. 
 But if you somehow ended up on my table, I think I might enjoy it. 
 That supposed to scare me, huh? 
 No, it's not supposed to scare you. 
 I'm gonna knock your ass out in front of all your friends. 
 Just say when. 
 Say when. 
 Now we can go.

 Hey, guys. Can I give you directions? 
 Recommendations for a less douchey car? 
 How about we give out the recommendations? 
 Stop looking into what you're looking into. 
 You mean, like, half-price tickets to "Hamilton"? 
 Any leads on that? 
 Come on, Doc. 
 You and the pretty detective have done enough damage. 
 We haven't even been formally introduced. 
 That doesn't seem right. 
 I'm Annalise. Who are you? 
 Last chance. 
 People are gonna get hurt. 
 Go back to Miami. 
 [Engine revs] 
 Mmm. 
 Well, Murillo was right about one thing. 
 Nothing like a slice of New York pie. 
 Fold it. [Chuckles] 
 Oh. Yeah. Yeah. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 Sorry. I gotta get this. 
 [Cellphone beeps] TMI: Rosie, you were right. 
 He had a series of remodeled bone injuries, many of them re-breaks... Ribs, wrist, clavicle. 
 So we're talking a series of recurring injuries in otherwise healthy bones. 
 So that confirms he was fighting. 
 Yeah. 
 Bro, it wasn't just Vitamin "K" in his system. 
 Oh, Pipp, you're there? 
 No. I'm a hologram. 
 Same technology they used for Tupac. 
 Just wish it was better news. 
 I mean, these "mints"... 
 They're not just regular steroids. 
 I found lethal doses of fluoxymesterone. 
 That's used in veterinary medicine. 
 Like, on a dog? 
 Or like a horse, if you want it to run fast, or an elephant. 
 Those mints could kill an average-size human. 
 The question is how they got them into Eddie's system, because TMI... she can't find an entry point. 
 I checked. I checked all the usual injection spots for steroids... 
 Uh, stomach, buttocks, hip... Nothing. So... 
 Girls, can you turn that body over for me, please? 
 I know you're trying to protect me, Rosie. 
 But... we're in it together. 
 I need to see this. 
 I need to. 
 Please. 
 Rosie, body's ready for your eyes. 
 Tee, um... bring the camera slowly down the scalp, please. 
 Okay. 
 All right. Stop, stop. 
 Zoom in right there. 
 That's it. 
 That's what killed him. 
 He wasn't taking steroids. 
 Someone injected him with a lethal dose in a liquid form. 
 Probably when he was knocked out in a fight. 
 He never saw it coming. 
 Do you realize... 
 The moment we exhumed Eddie's body in Miami, we triggered the attention of a lot of dangerous people. 
 We need to get back to that gym. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 Do you have any desire to let me know why we're really here? 
 No offense, Ira, but I feel like you'd be a lot more fun if you drank something. 
 Lucia. 
 How did you find me here? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 What was the whole cosmetic counter bit, then? 
 I didn't know where she worked. 
 And it's not what you think. 
 Oh, no. I get it. 
 You see hookers. 
 I've never touched her, all right? She's a friend. 
 A friend you paid to schtup. 
 You ever get insomnia, Ira? 
 I get agita. It's kind of the same thing. 
 Keeps me up. But yeah, I know what you mean. 
 Mm-hmm, yeah, 'cause you and I, we see a lot of things during the day, don't we? 
 When I go to sleep, I still see them. 
 So... 
 I pay her to read to me. 
 It helps me fall asleep. 
 She reads? 
 I'm not gonna lie... That's unnatural. 
 And reads what? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Sports scores, Y.A. novels, the back of a shampoo bottle. 
 Just the sound of a sweet voice. 
 Hey. Excuse me. You Cameron? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, man, how are you? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Ohh! [Grunts] 
 You know, I've been wanting to chat with you. 
 Like a... Like reasonable men. 
 I'm pretty reasonable, aren't I, Ira? 
 Uh, depends what scale we're talking about. 
 Yeah, well, you know, here's the thing, Cam. 
 I've gotten to know one of your employees pretty well... Lucia. 
 Sweet girl. 
 She's a great girl, right? 
 Mm. 
 Yeah, you see, we have this little, um, reading group together, and I compensate her nicely for it, but I don't know... 
 She tells me that she never sees a dime of it because it all goes into your trying-too-hard pants pocket. 
 And you don't help me sleep, do you? 
 No. 
 Right. See, I didn't think so. 
 Now, Cam, look into my eyes. 
 Dreamy, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Those are just a glassy facade for the true crazy swirling behind them. 
 See, you don't know me or what I do, but I assure you... I have the power to turn this place into a puppy shelter, which would be a way better use of the space. 
 But, like I told you, I am a reasonable man. 
 So what do we say you make sure I never catch wind of you not treating someone like Lucia with the kind of decency and respect she deserves? 
 Does that sound reasonable? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Uh... 
 I got to say, uh... put some words together. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 Um... 
 I have to go take care of something. 
 It's personal. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 I don't have cooties. 
 Let's go. 
 [Clears throat] Listen. 
 Hands up! [Gasps] 
 Come on, get away from the body! 
 We don't... We don't keep any money here. 
 I said get away from the body... now! 
 Okay, okay. Just deal with me. 
 Let her go. 
 I'll give you whatever it is that you want. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 Villa : That trainer was hiding something, but there's always a paper trail. 
 Rosie, come look at this. 
 What am I looking at? 
 It's Eddie. 
 Where does it say "Eddie"? 
 It doesn't, but it says "H. 4793." 
 That's Eddie's middle initial and the last four of his Social Security number. 
 It must be a code for names. 
 Why is Eddie's name on a list? 
 Look here. 
 Multiple checks written to the gym. 
 Look where the checks come from. 
 Ree Co. R.E.E. Co. 
 "Rico" isn't a guy. It's a company. 
 And whoever is behind that company was a man Eddie was afraid of. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Jacott. That's it. 
 That's Eddie's kid from the school... Oliver Jacott. 
 Made a fortune in the life-insurance game. 
 Lives in a giant spread out in the Hamptons. 
 All these checks are written for charitable donations to the gym for new equipment, upgrades. 
 I didn't see a punching bag hanging in there that was less than 30 years old. 
 Then what did they use the money for? 
 [Switch clicks] 
 [Floorboards creak] 
 Villa : Hey, Bennie, what are you doing here? 
 I sleep here. 
 You broke in. You need to go. 
 Easy, buddy. We just want to talk. 
 You remember us, right? 
 I sensed you wanted to help. 
 Now's your chance. 
 But before you start yapping, a mint? 
 You're kind of blasting us from over there. 
 Yeah, fetor oris halitosis. 
 Or it could be a guilty conscience. 
 Does a number on the gullet. 
 Oh, these... These surprise you? 
 Were those guys selling drugs from this gym? 
 Was Eddie involved? 
 Eddie was my friend. 
 Did Jacott hire him as muscle for his business? 
 How'd you know about Jacott? 
 We're asking the questions. 
 Is that how Eddie got the injuries to his ribs and his wrists? 
 No. Eddie didn't work for Jacott. 
 He fought for him. 
 High stakes. No gloves. 
 No rules. 
 Jacott witnessed Eddie punching the principal. 
 That's why he didn't want to get him fired. 
 He saw something way better. 
 He was making money off of Eddie's fighting. 
 But why would he get involved? 
 Same reason everyone else did... For the money. 
 But that's... 
 Eddie didn't need to risk his life for extra money. 
 Eddie : You know, when the little Lunez comes, you're gonna put that gun away for good. 
 [Chuckles] Really? 
 Are you planning on winning the lottery or something? 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 Look at me. Look at me. 
 I think a baby... 
 I-I'm not gonna be able to retire anytime soon. 
 I won't let you risk getting hurt. 
 Listen. 
 I will take care of us. 
 Always. 
 Did Jacott supply you with steroids? 
 That was available, but Eddie didn't use any. 
 Wasn't his thing. 
 But you did. 
 That's what caused the shaking in your hands and in your neck. 
 I had a promising career... 8-0. 
 Man, you don't understand... That drug, it's crazy. 
 I didn't want to take them, but it made me feel invincible, like I could fight the world. 
 And then the seizures started. 
 And it destroyed any chances that I had. 
 It destroyed me. 
 Eddie saw that happen. 
 He wanted to do something about it. 
 Can you get us into that mansion? 
 You need to be a fighter, have someone sponsor you... 
 A minimum of a 50k buy-in. 
 But that's not a good idea. 
 Bad things happen inside of those gates of that place. 
 Drop it! EMPD. 
 Drop it! 
 [Groans] 
 Well, that was efficient. 
 I think we're in the clear. 
 Hornstock, did you just save our lives? 
 Listen, Rosie knows I'm here. Everything's gonna be okay. 
 I just need you two to go upstairs and give Captain Slade and I some privacy, okay? 
 Yeah. All right. 
 It's all okay. 
 Hey. Stuff on the line. 
 Maybe I got it from here. 
 Well, the book says we read him his rights, we bring him in, and we question him proper. 
 Yeah, I can't do that. 
 [Groans] 
 Who sent you?! Start talking! 
 [Groaning] 
 Who... sent... you?! 
 Go straight to hell! 
 Hmm. He's not in a talky mood. 
 [Screaming] 
 All right, you little bitch, I'm gonna give you two seconds to speak before I gut you and have you bleed all over this shiny floor. 
 You got me? [Grunting] 
 Huh?! You think I'm kidding?! 
 You crazy, man?! 
 All right, all right, all right! 
 S-S-Some guy from New York, okay? 
 Supposed, to, uh, get rid of his body. 
 Why? 
 Why?! 
 Oh, man. Drugs, all right? 
 Supposed to cover up his drugs, man. 
 That's all I know. I swear. 
 All right, you're gonna call this guy, and in your very, very happy voice, you're gonna tell him everything's okay... 
 You're successful, and you dealt with the body. 
 And then you and I are gonna talk all about these drugs. 
 Dial. 
 Dial! 
 [Knock on door] 
 Rosie, I slept on it... Or didn't sleep. 
 Point is... 
 We're good. 
 Rosie, who the hell was that? 
 I'm making moves here. 
 The only moves you need are to roll your socks, pack your underwear, and head back to the airport. 
 Well, I'm not going anywhere, and I never roll my socks. 
 Stretches the material. 
 Fine. then don't roll anything. Just go. 
 I mean, you know, you roll, and then, you know, you lose elasticity, Then they start rolling down to your ankles, and then nobody wants that. 
 I don't want that. Do you want that? 
 Okay, I can't have you here anymore. 
 I'm not sure what I'm even gonna do, but I'm doing it alone. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 The thing is, you don't understand. I did this. 
 Things I said got Eddie wrapped up in this world. 
 It's my fault, okay? 
 His death is my fault, and if anyone's gonna get hurt, it's gonna be me. 
 We're getting into the mansion. 
 We have no way in... Or backup. 
 And we would need a fighter. 
 I'm your fighter. You're looking at him. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I reached out to Bennie. He gave me a name. 
 That's who that guy was. 
 He was supposed to fight. I paid him to walk away. 
 I'm his replacement. 
 No. No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 Villa, if the Rosewoods are good at anything, we're good at bobbing and weaving. 
 We're weavers, see? Let's weave. 
 See, that's the bob. 
 Okay, wait... 
 No, no, that's the bob. 
 This is the weave. 
 What... What... 
 You got to do shoulder like that. That's the weave. 
 Plus, I can stall until you get what you need. 
 What about the 50k? Where are we gonna get that kind of cash? 
 Paid that, too. 
 Wired to Jacott this morning, 5:00 a.m. 
 Gave me the pass code to the entrance. 
 We're in. 
 Rosie, you... 
 [Voice breaking] You were up since 5:00 a.m.? 
 I was working out. 
 I got a fight coming up. 
 M gonna use my code word at the gate. 
 You're gonna gain entrance to the pool party here as a guest. 
 You sure you can get in? 
 Don't worry. You're looking at my code word. 
 All right, here we go, then. 
 Go on through. 
 I'm check in for the fight. Rosie. 
 Oh. So you're the replacement. 
 And you put up your own membership. 
 I only bet on myself. 
 Please show our fighter to the changing rooms. 
 You're matched up with Hemoglovich. 
 Who's Hemoglovich? 
 Rosewood : Once I'm situated, I'll find you at the party. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Look for me at the south lawn service entrance. 
 [Whispering] Villa. 
 They're blurry. It's hard to tell. 
 I'm thinking this one is the floors, and the window's somewhere inside here. 
 Eddie was documenting a trail. 
 Okay, look, you do your thing. You find those steroids. 
 You get our proof that he killed Eddie. 
 Then we call it in, and that's it. 
 Okay. 
 That's it? 
 That's it. 
 Rosie, please be careful. 
 Bob and weave, baby. 
 Just in case.

 [Crowd gasps] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Man : That was a hell of a fight! 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 Gotcha. 
 [Door creaks] 
 Rosie. 
 We got to get out of here. 
 Jacott's onto us. He'll find us any second. 
 You got what we need to nail him? 
 Yeah. I do. 
 All right, good. 
 We're gonna call in the cavalry and we're gonna end this thing safely, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. 
 [Lock clicks] Villa, don't do that! Open the door! 
 This is between me and Eddie's killer now. 
 What are you doing?! 
 Villa! [Knocks] 
 Oh, look. I brought my gun, too. 
 [Whispering] Villa! 
 Your husband, Eddie, was a good fighter. 
 Had a great right hook. We made a lot of money together. 
 But he knew too much about my other business... 
 Tried to be a hero. 
 Does it run in the family? 
 What are you doing, Villa? 
 [Doorknob rattles] Open the door. 
 You know, in the insurance game, my job is to use actuaries to predict the length of people's lives. 
 With your physique and flawless skin, you're a good bet to be around for a long time. 
 But the thing that actuaries don't take into account is people who make dumb decisions and get themselves killed. 
 And that was Eddie. 
 Maybe that's me, too. 
 But I know I'm a good enough shot to take you down with me. 
 Wait, wait. You guys are... You guys are the ones from... 
 We're DEA. No time to explain. Step out of the way. 
 Wait, wait. Okay, they have guns pointed. 
 You're gonna get her shot. 
 Step away before we remove you. 
 [Gunshots] Let's go! 
 Move! Go! Move! 
 Officer : Right here! I got him! 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. It's just a graze. 
 Just make sure that b*st*rd stays alive. 
 [Sirens wailing, police radio chatter] 
 So, you knew about Eddie the whole time? 
 He came to us about Jacott and the drugs. 
 It launched what's been a 2 1/2-year investigation. 
 But why did he...? 
 He didn't want to put you in danger. 
 He was trying to protect you, and so were we. 
 It's been building up to this weekend, when we knew there was a huge shipment coming in. 
 And... we were doing our own investigation. 
 We had to try and get you to back off. 
 We couldn't risk our own operation. 
 Eddie was trying to do the right thing. 
 Agent : And he died because of it. 
 But, Detective, you should know... 
 This is all because of Eddie. 
 It was his info that let us take down this whole operation. 
 Oh, hey. You're here. 
 Left my phone charger. [Chuckles] 
 Oh. 
 Let me help you find that. 
 Is it over there or... 
 Oh. You found it. 
 I found it. 
 Nice. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Pipp. 
 You stepped in front of a bullet for me. 
 It's not like he shot, so... 
 But that's the kind of thing people do in movies when they're crazy about each other. 
 I'll always be crazy about you. 
 But, Tee, you got to let me go. 
 So that I can maybe find my own way back. 
 [Door opens] 
 Rosie. 
 Thank you. 
 No. No, thank you. 
 Why would you be thanking me? 
 Well, I've been given a lot of gifts in my life. 
 But what we have, how we work, all the stuff we're able to do together... 
 Nothing beats it. 
 Well, that's a relief, 'cause... 
 I was gonna get you something, like a sweater or something. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But I guess I'm good now. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, all those doubts that you had about the kind of man that Eddie really was... 
 He was better than I ever knew. 
 So, where do we go from here? 
 Home. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Oh, Ira. Thanks for popping in. 
 Sure. 
 I was just going over this report. 
 What report? 
 The report of what happened at the lab. 
 I told you that was personal. Why the report? 
 You know... I wasn't gonna, really. 
 But when I remembered you announced yourself as a detective of my department, you put the badge on the line, which kind of makes it sticky, man. 
 I had no choice. You understand, right? 
 Oh, I understand. 
 Well, good. 
 Why don't you do me a favor? Walk this upstairs. 
 Just let the chips fall as they may. 
 [Sighs] 
 I know you got something on me. 
 I know what my demons are. 
 What I did to that man this time was out of loyalty to a friend. 
 You want to know my weakness? 
 That's it. 
 Protecting the people I love. 
 You know what that feels like? 
 My guess is you don't. 
 I have no regrets. 
 In fact, I would do it again any day of the week. 
 So you want this report walked somewhere? 
 You walk it yourself. 
 [Whirring] 
 Well. Look who's back. 
 You enjoy your much-needed R&R? 
 It was the best. 
 I feel rejuvenated, like a new woman. 
 Good. 
 'Cause here's your next case. 
 It's a doozy. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Hey, you better not be climbing into this bed with cookies! 
 [Muffled] Oh. "This bed"? You mean "our bed." 
 Oh. Oh. 
 Well, I guess for somebody, wedding vows and promises mean nothing. 
 Wait. No, no, no. 
 The "no eating cookies in bed" vow was meant for you. 
 Is that right? 
 That's right. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You can't mess my cookie-eating skills, girl. 
 Been doing it since I was a kid. 
 I can eat a whole cookie without dropping a single crumb. 
 You can't take a bite without leaving it all in the sheets. 
 That is not true. 
 It's true, Lissie. It's true. 
 You are good at a great many things. 
 Eating cookies in bed is not one of them. 
 So, what are you saying? 
 I just have to... just put up with this for the rest of my life? 
 Hmm? 
 For the rest of your life. 
 Even when I'm 80 years old and I've got ear and nose hair and a hump on my back. 
 But you will still be the most beautiful woman that I've ever eaten cookies in bed with. 
 Mm.
