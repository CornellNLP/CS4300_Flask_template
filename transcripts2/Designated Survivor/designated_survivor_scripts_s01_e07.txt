 Previously on "Designated Survivor"... 
 MacLeish turned down Speaker of the House. 
 What about the vice presidency? 
 I would be honored. 
 MacLeish? For VP? 
 They want to start the vetting. 
 I have a source claiming that Leo Kirkman is not the president's son. 
 Chernow : We have Majid Nassar. 
 Effective interrogation takes time. 
 You've got 24 hours. 
 Hannah : You signed on to this, and you don't know the person who set you up? 
 He said his name was Catalan. 
 If you tell anyone, he'll kill you, too. 
 What is it? 
 Nassar. 
 And I found him like this. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cell door closes] 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Jason : I want the name of every single person that came in contact with that food. 
 I want tox, I want DNA, I want fingerprints. 
 I want video-camera surveillance footage. 
 Every single result comes to me. 
 [Buzzer] 
 Still wrapping things up. 
 Whoever blew up the Capitol must have murdered Nassar before he told anyone else the truth. 
 He told us, Jason. 
 I know. 
 But what good does that do us now? 
 We have no proof. 
 Which is why we need to press on with the only lead Nassar gave us. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Lieutenant's outside. Watch your back. 
 But if we're the only ones that he told about Catalan, it's only a matter of time before they come for us.

 Tom : When the New York Yankees took the field a week after 9/11, they allowed us to move forward with our lives. 
 It was sports, not speeches, that allowed us to get back on our feet. 
 So when I heard that our athletes were going to Moscow to compete in the International Track and Field Championships, I wanted to thank them myself. 
 Coach Weston. 
 [Applause, camera shutters clicking] 
 It's an honor, Mr. President. 
We're extremely proud. 
 Especially after what our nation's been through. 
 The honor is mine. 
 Coach Weston, show them what we've got. 
 [Applause continues, camera shutters clicking] 
 You must get this all the time, but back in '92, when you broke the world record for the 400 meters, that was one of the most incredible things I'd ever seen. 
 I appreciate that, Mr. President. 
 Wyatt : Excuse me, Mr. President. 
 Congressman MacLeish and his wife have arrived. 
 Thank you, Wyatt. 
 I'm sorry. I have to step away. 
 It was a pleasure to meet you. 
 Remember, Mr. President... 
Leaders are made, not born. 
 We're rooting for you, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 [Laughter] 
 I don't know what it was I ate, but whatever it was, I was sick as a dog. 
 And let me guess. 
 Like a gentleman, he held your hair back the whole time. 
 No. He put me in a cab on my own, and he went back into the restaurant, and he sat there until they shut the kitchen down so that no one else would get sick. 
 Oh. 
 And that is when I knew... 
 That I would be a good health inspector. 
 [Laughter] 
 How about you guys? 
 H-How did you first meet? 
 We met in college. 
 My sorority sister came home one day and said, "I have the perfect guy for you. He's cute. He is funny." 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And that was... 
 My roommate. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Who could not have been less interested in me. 
 I don't believe that. 
 Well, to soften the blow, he introduced me to Peter. 
 I like to think I reaped the benefits of my roommate's poor judgment. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How do you think it's going? 
 Well, probably the same as when you asked 10 minutes ago. 
 First game back, the Wizards are already bombing. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm sorry. Poor choice of words. 
 I'm telling you... We're never gonna find a better candidate for vice president than MacLeish. 
 You  know that.  I  know that. 
 But POTUS has never been in this position before. 
 He wants to be thorough. 
 I just wish we could fast-forward to the part where we give the country some good news for once. 
 Especially with elections coming up. 
 [ Whistle blows ] 
 No! 
 Wall can't play through that one! 
 He's got to get Porter or Beal involved. 
 Porter was late filling the lane. 
 What? 
 Men don't own sports. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Aaron Shore. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 I'll let him know. 
 Damn it. 
 What is it? 
 Hey, Aaron, I need five minutes with the president. 
 It's personal. 
 The president's not doing personal tonight. 
 Beth : Do you mind if I ask a question? 
 Alex : Sure. Go ahead. 
 I-I... I guess I'm just curious what it's like really living here, you know, with your family and your marriage, the scrutiny. 
 We're still trying to figure that out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Door opens] 
 Aaron : Sorry to interrupt. 
 Mr. President, may I have a word, please? 
 Of course. Will you excuse me? 
 So, where is the roommate now? 
 Majid Nassar is dead? 
 How the hell is that even possible? 
 He was in our custody. 
 FBI's investigating. 
 They say he was poisoned in his cell. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 I can get Deputy Director Atwood here within the hour for a briefing. 
 Do it... now. 
 Aaron. 
 Not a word of this to anyone. 
 Not until we have some answers. 
 I am so sorry. 
 This is gonna take longer than I had hoped. 
 Oh no, no. Don't apologize. 
 We understand. Duty calls. 
 Mr. President, I know I'm not VP yet, and... and maybe I never will be, but if there's ever anything I can do to help you ease your burden, I hope you won't hesitate to ask. 
 Thank you, Peter. 
 Again, I am so sorry. 
 Excuse me. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yeah, of course. 
 All right. 
 The president wants a briefing on the Nassar murder. 
 Now? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, you need to tell him... 
Everything we know. 
 The president is expecting me to brief him on a murder investigation. 
 He's gonna think I'm crazy if I blindside him with theories about MacLeish. 
 They're not theories. 
 Peter MacLeish has closer ties to the attack than Nassar ever did, and we have evidence of that. 
 It is only a matter of time before he's a heartbeat away from the presidency. 
 Kirkman needs to know that. 
 Wish me luck. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Good luck. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Wyatt : The president's ready for you, sir. 
 Mr. President. 
 Thank you, Wyatt. 
 Deputy Director, please tell me that you've got some answers. 
 I believe I do, sir. 
 That's good news. 
 Congressman MacLeish. 
 I wasn't expecting to see you. 
 The congressman has served on the Subcommittee for Terrorism and Homeland Security. 
 Given the circumstances, I felt it was appropriate that he joined us tonight. 
 [Clears throat] Yes, of course. 
 What the hell happened with Nassar? 
 Well, we don't have much intel at the moment, but I promise you we're looking into every possibility. 
 Did we get anything out of him before he died? 
 He wasn't very cooperative. 
 [Sighs] I get that he wasn't cooperative. 
 You asked for the authority to interrogate him. 
 I gave it to you. 
 I assumed you knew what you were doing. 
 I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
 I wish I could say more. 
 Deputy Director, when you walked in, you said you thought you had answers. 
 I meant that we are still working on it. 
 Fine. 
 That'll be all. 
 Get back to me when you've actually got something. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Mr. President. 
 Congressman. 
 That didn't make any sense. 
 Oh, Mr. President, I have to believe the FBI is doing everything they can to solve this. 
 I'm sure you're right. 
 This is becoming a habit. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I remember when you used to wake up to me working. 
 Trust me, I liked it better that way. 
 What's going on? 
 You ever get that weird feeling when you think someone's lying to you? 
 Mm. 
 Of course you do. 
 You're a lawyer. 
 Who are you thinking? 
 Jason Atwood. 
 Deputy Director, FBI. 
 Why do you think he's lying? 
 Can't say exactly. 
 I just have this feeling that something's not right. 
 Atwood pressed me really hard to interrogate Majid Nassar. 
 12 hours later, Nassar's dead. 
 Atwood can't answer a single question about how or why. 
 It just doesn't feel right. 
 Well, when I'm trying a case, I only bring up what I can prove. 
 Atwood's not gonna give you any answers that he can't stand behind. 
 I'd just give him some time.

 [Door opens, closes] 
 Morning, Mr. President. 
 Did you get any sleep? 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm sure that bedroom's seen a lot of things, but I don't think a good night's sleep is one of them. 
 Look, I need you to stay on top of the Nassar investigation. 
 Use every resource our intelligence community has to offer. 
 Absolutely, sir. 
 Good morning, Wyatt. 
 Good morning, Mr. President. 
 Mr. President, I just got off the phone with our ambassador in Russia. 
 Coach Weston was arrested upon landing in Moscow. 
 What? On what charges? 
 Customs found 20 vials of HGH in his bag. 
 They're saying that he's been supplying his athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. 
 And the Russians are complaining? 
 That's ironic. 
 I don't believe it. 
 Whether it's true or not, the head of the U.S.A. team was arrested on foreign soil. 
 This is a national embarrassment. 
 The State Department needs to get him a lawyer. 
 They're sending one over right now. 
 I want to talk to them right away. 
I meant what I said last night. 
 Coach Weston is a national hero. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I wouldn't be surprised if the president tried to fire me. 
 How the hell am I gonna talk about MacLeish if MacLeish is standing right there? 
 I got to get another meeting as soon as possible. 
 Where are we with Catalan? 
 TIDE and Interpol came up with nothing. 
 The only hits on any watch lists are old Spanish radicals. 
 Did you run him as a specially designated national? 
 Nothing. 
 How the hell are we gonna get lucky? 
 Well, not everything the CIA knows comes up on the TIDE database, so... 
 You got a source? 
 I do. 
 I'm gonna see him this afternoon. 
 He just doesn't know it yet. 
 Let me know as soon as Weston speaks with the lawyers from the embassy. 
 This is a top priority for the president. 
 Hey, I really need that five minutes with the president. 
 Aaron : Now is not a good time, Seth. 
 A national icon's on his way to the Gulag. - Yeah, fully aware. 
 I have 50 reporters waiting for me to comment on that. 
 But I really need to talk to him. 
 I told you... The president has no time for personal requests right now. 
 Look, you don't understand. 
This is not  me  personal. 
 This is  POTUS  personal. 
 That reporter I met the other night, Lisa... 
 She needs a comment on a story. 
 What story? 
 A couple of days ago, she says a criminal-defense lawyer came to see her. 
 He says that his client, who he will not name, is Leo's biological father. 
 Aaron : All right. 
 You can have your five minutes... now. 
 Is it true? 
 His name is Jeffrey Myers. 
 Alex was seeing him when we met. 
 She broke it off right before we started dating. 
 When we found out Alex was pregnant, the timing of that scared her. 
 She asked me if I wanted to take a test. 
 I said no. Nothing would change. 
 I loved her. 
 Well, the good thing is, without a paternity test, they don't have anything concrete. 
 He doesn't need it. 
 Once the story goes public, it's gonna raise questions that won't go away until they're answered. 
 What's he in prison for? 
 He was convicted two years ago of felony tax evasion. 
 Five-year sentence. 
 For tax evasion? How much was he hiding? 
 $46 million. 
 Seth, this reporter... 
 Lisa Jordan from the  Chronicle. 
 Right. What does she want? 
 A comment. 
 I can hold her off, but I don't have any ground to stand on. 
 The story doesn't have any national-security implications. 
 No. Just family ones. 
 Hold her off as long as you can. 
 I don't want Alex and Leo getting blindsided by this. 
 Si... 
 Uh... 
 What? 
 Well, sir, the... 
The first lady already knows that Myers has been talking. 
 What? 
 A week ago. We were talking about it, and she promised me that she would talk to you. 
 You knew that son of a bitch Myers was making noise a week ago, and you didn't tell me? 
 Oh, w-when was I supposed to do that? 
 Between Majid Nassar, uh, the governors holding you hostage... 
 Come on, Alex. That's not fair. 
 We have a deal. 
 No matter what's happening with us, our children come first. 
 Don't you dare throw that at me. 
 My whole life has been about protecting them, especially now. 
 17 years trying to shield Leo from this. 
 All it took was a month in the White House to undo it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Maybe the mistake was keeping it from him in the first place. 
 [Sighs] 
 Seth thinks he can buy us some time. 
 Time? 
 He can get us all the time in the world. 
 This is not gonna go away. 
 You are the president now. 
 Why don't I try and talk to Myers, see if I can fix this? 
 No, no. That's not a good idea. 
 Well, do you have a better one? 
 [Telephone rings] 
 What?! 
 What is it? 
 Acting Secretary of State Paulsen has brought James Carrera with her. 
 Why? 
 They wouldn't tell me, sir, but they said it was urgent. 
 Thank you, Wyatt. 
 Director Carrera. Secretary Paulsen. 
 Mr. President. 
 Do we have an update on Al-Sakar? 
 No, sir. 
 We need to talk to you about Brad Weston. 
 Okay. 
 We need to do everything we can to bring him back home immediately. 
 Is there something I should know? 
 Sir, Brad Weston is one of ours. 
 He works for the CIA. 
 He's a spy? 
 I can't believe Coach Weston is a spy. 
 He's not an officer. He's a resource. 
 As a world-class coach, he gets into rooms with ministers, oligarchs, presidents, and when he returns to America, he shares with us what he's seen and heard. 
 But what about the drugs? 
 We suspect they were planted to give the Russians a pretense for his arrest. 
 What's the maximum sentence? 
 For drugs? Life. 
 For espionage? Death. 
 Without our help, he's never leaving Russia.

 We're a dying breed.

 FBI is persona non grata at the moment. 
 Your boss made a play to wrestle Nassar away from the CIA. 
 We take that personally. 
 All right. 
 I'll just have to find Catalan myself. 
 Hey. 
 Where the hell did you hear that name? 
 I've run his name through every database. 
 I got nothing. The guy's a ghost. 
 If the agency knows anything... 
 Here's what I know. 
 Stay out of it. 
 And if you ask anyone else, they'll tell you the same, just less politely. 
 The man's a mercenary... and a traitor. 
 What do you mean? 
 He's American? 
 Wait a minute. That's all you're going to give me? 
 You don't think I'm helping you, Hannah? 
 Walk away. 
 That's the best help anyone can give you. 
 Now, sir, in the off chance that the Russians don't know that Weston is working for us, we can't say anything to Ambassador Petrov that might compromise him. 
 I understand. 
 Don't admit anything until they do. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Men conversing in Russian] 
 Ambassador Petrov. 
 I'm President Kirkman. 
 I wish we were meeting under better circumstances, Mr. President. 
 It's a shame to see a legend like Mr. Weston rely on such dishonest means to win. 
 Yes, I know how stringent your country has been about that sort of thing. 
 Well, this is a serious violation of our laws. 
 Maybe that's why you brought a representative from your ministry of defense to this meeting. 
 I didn't realize that personal drug infractions was a matter of national security in Russia. 
 Well, perhaps it's for the same reason you brought your head of CIA. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Mr. President, it's time to drop the charade. 
 We both know Brad Weston is a U.S. asset. 
 You and I have a very different perspective on who Coach Weston is. 
 Having said that, I do believe that both our countries would be served dealing with this as quietly and quickly as possible. 
 What do you want? 
 All American nuclear weapons removed from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. 
 [Chuckles] 
 That will never happen. 
 Then I'm afraid your asset will face the Russian courts... which do not look kindly on either drugs... or spies. 
 And with the cooperation of our nation's governors, as you know, special congressional elections have been confirmed for later this week. 
 Okay, I just have time for a couple more questions. 
 Yeah. 
 Where is Majid Nassar? 
 And why is the White House being so secretive about his location? 
 Shelly, we've been through this. 
 Majid Nassar is at an undisclosed location both for his protection and for the safety of those guarding him. 
 Seth. 
 Any update on Brad Weston? 
 Yes. The president had a very productive meeting with the Russian ambassador, and we're hopeful that the situation will be resolved soon, okay? 
 Thanks, everybody. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 
 
 
 Thank you. 
 Lisa, hey. 
 Well, if it isn't Seth Wright. 
 You have that comment for me, or you just miss me already? 
 Can I talk to you privately? 
 Yeah. 
 So, I have a very uncomfortable, likely inappropriate favor to ask you. 
 Okay. 
 I need you to hold that story on Leo for as long as possible. 
 'Cause it's true? 
 I'm not saying that.

But I can assure you that we have everyone looking for him. Transmit it directly. We've got the right encryption packet in place. Mr. President, my apologies. Our agents needed time to confirm. You need to see this. Put it up on the screen. What am I looking at? The one on the right is Viktor Mishkin. Our Moscow station identified him as a Russian FSB captain, and the top recruiter of foreign assets. And the man on his left? That's Brad Weston, sir. However it happened, he's still in Russia. He made contact with their intelligence a few minutes ago. We believe the other man is Weston's contact and handler. Handler? [Sighs] We now know why he didn't get on that plane. Son of a bitch. Brad Weston is a double agent. You know, for a spook, you're pretty easy to track. Why are you here? I meant what I said. I'm not helping you. Stay out of it. I can't. I need what you have on Catalan. Tim... please. I'm out of time. Hannah, I don't want to see you get hurt. There are people that I love that are in trouble. I don't care what happens to me. I care what happens to  them. Please. [Sighs] Let me see what I can do. ♪ ♪ Mr. President. Ambassador Petrov. Thank you, Wyatt. Mr. Ambassador, you played me today. During the 10 years that Mr. Weston worked with the CIA, he gained access to case officers. A clandestine treasure trove, if you will. Now it's yours. Congratulations. Russia is a free country, Mr. President. Perhaps Mr. Weston simply chose to remain in Moscow. When you've been at the game of international chess for more than a month, you'll understand these things. [Chuckles] Well, I may have been in over my head today, but I promise you... I'm a quick study. And the one thing that I do know about chess is that there is nothing more dangerous than a pawn that thinks it's a queen. Take care, Mr. Ambassador. Mr. President. Hey. Lisa : Hey. Relax. You still have 19 hours left. Yeah, I don't think I need them. Oh. You have that comment for me? No. I have something else... An exclusive. Well, I've already got an exclusive. Yeah, I'm betting you're gonna want this one. Why is that? It's not gossip. I am not a gossip columnist, Seth. I'm building a political profile of a man this country is desperate to know more about... Your boss. But it's good to know that's how you see me. Lisa, that's not how I see you. Look, you can publish the piece on Leo. I just don't think you should. President Kirkman is a good man. They're a great family. He didn't ask for this job, but now he's got it, and everyone's gunning for him. And Leo's 17. I don't think he deserves to have his life analyzed on the front page. So, what's the exclusive? Inside information, first-person account, of how the president negotiated for the release of an American hero, only to discover he's not who he seems. What do you have on Weston? Let's make a deal, and I'll tell you. Thank you, Wyatt. Of course, sir. [Aaron speaking indistinctly] Emily : Oh, yeah. Thank you. It's late. Don't you two ever go home? We'll go home when the next president takes office. Want to get a head start on tomorrow's work? Since you haven't been sleeping much anyway. Show me what you got. After your morning security briefing, you'll be meeting the director of the National Economic Council. And? What else? MacLeish, sir. What about him? Well, sir, we've been thinking since you two hit it off so well, maybe we should make it official. The press is already speculating he might be your vice president. And with the congressional elections coming up next week... The country could use some good news. Don't you think? I've decided to wait to hear what the FBI has to say. If today's taught me anything, it's that you can't know enough about a person. Aaron, any news yet from Deputy Director Atwood on who might have killed Nassar? No, sir. I've been trying to get ahold of him all afternoon. His secretary said he's been out of the office on personal business. Personal business? During a murder investigation? I'll keep on top of him, sir. Good. The last thing we need is the world to find out that Nassar is dead and we don't know who did it. Presidential order... Both of you, go home, get some sleep. Thanks for everything. Thank you, sir. [Knock on door] Yeah? What's up? Ju... Just wanted to say good night. Okay. What? Why are you looking at me like that? I don't know. It... A lot's happened in this last six weeks. I feel like I haven't seen you or talked to you. Is everything all right? Yeah. I... I just wanted to tell you that I love you. Yeah. I love you, too. Good night. Good night. ♪ ♪ [Vehicle door slams] ♪ ♪ Man : Chow time. Guess your guy will have to wait. ♪ ♪ [Cellphone ringing] [Vehicle door closes] Coach! Have you seen my son? Come on. Jason, it's Hannah. Call me back. I know who killed Nassar. Luke?! Mr. Atwood. I noticed your son didn't show up for practice. Have you seen him? I can assure you, Luke is fine. In fact, he's the only kid I know who likes coffee ice cream. Where's my son? Where is my son? Deep breath, Jason. Think it through. Anything happens to me, and the next photo you'll see is Luke with a bullet in his brain. I know you love your family, and it would be a tragedy if something happened to Luke... or to Yvette... sometime after you buried your son. You hurt my family, I promise you... I will kill you and whoever the hell you're working with. Your son will be safe as long as you do everything I tell you to do, starting with the obvious. Tell anyone about this encounter and Luke dies. What do you want? You're going to make an appointment with the president. And when you're face-to-face with Kirkman, you will do exactly as I instruct. I'll be in touch. ♪ ♪
