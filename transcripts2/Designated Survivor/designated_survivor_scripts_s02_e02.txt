 Previously on "Designated Survivor"... 
 Why do you think I need a political director? 
 - Currently the polls say... 
 - I don't care about the polls. 
 You should, sir. 
 Lyor is here because we need a direction, someone to help with our messaging, and there is no one better. 
 Hannah: Our target is Patrick Lloyd. 
 We believe that he is responsible    for the bombing on our Capitol. 
 C-can you update the status    of the Lloyd investigation? 
 All our best people are on it. 
 - How long have you been on Lloyd's trail? 
 - Months. 
 But I'm surprised to find British Intelligence on this. 
 Damian: Lloyd knows we're getting closer. 
 He's covering his tracks. 
 He's got a bunch of passports here... 
 He's got about a dozen tickets... 
 All for this morning, all for different airports.

 It's from a BWI surveillance video...

 You can't make out a face. 
 No, but you can make out an ear.

 Biometrically, ears are as identifiable as fingerprints. 
 [Keyboard clacking, computer beeping] 
 Bingo. 
 That's our guy. 
 - Impressive. 
 - Well, I have a degree in criminology. 
 That's good, Chuck. 
 Thanks. 
 Six months on the move, he's got to be running out of options. 
 Why would he go back to the scene of the crime? 
 There's something he wants here. 
 But he's exposed, and all alone. 
 You've arrested his confederates. 
 - What about family? 
 - Divorced. 
 He doesn't speak to his ex. 
 He does have an estranged son in Reston, but he hasn't spoken to him in    years. 
 Well, blood's still blood, and it sounds like he's got nowhere else to go. 
 All right, I'll... 
 We'll  check it out.

 - Aaron Shore. 
 Tell the President I'm on my way. 
 Mr. President, you promised the public transparency. 
 Yes, but what's he going to say, Emily? 
 "My fellow Americans, Patrick Lloyd is back. 
 - Run for you lives"? 
 - No, he's gonna say, "pursuant to my promise of transparency"... 
 Aaron, how badly will we compromise the investigation if we go public? 
 Completely, sir. 
 Lloyd returned to D.C. for a reason, but he'll disappear if he knows we're hunting him. 
 Then there are other practical concerns of tipping him. 
 Which are? 
 He's an unpredictable adversary with unlimited resources. 
 Meaning he could have a dirty bomb, a tactical nuke. 
 And once we locate him, we'll have to remove him from a population center before we bring him down. 
 So the pursuit has to stay covert. 
 What kind of manpower are we talking about to accomplish this? 
 About agents would constitute a minimum effective deployment. 
 He's got a   -hour lead, but we have NSA satellites sweeping through every Browning-Reed facility, any place he's ever frequented. 
 As long as he stays above ground, we will acquire him. 
 Em, you're right... 
 I made a promise regarding transparency, but I made a bigger promise to the American people, and that's to keep them safe. 
 So for now, we keep a lid on this. 
 Congress has to know. 
 Yes. 
 I agree. 
 If this goes wrong and you kept them in the dark, you'll get slaughtered, sir. 
 You need cover. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We'll inform HSC. 
 Not because I need cover, but because this is not a government of one. 
 Thank you.

 Emily: Not yet. 
 - You are gonna read them, though, right?

 Seth's funny.

 Aaron: Our most up-to-date Lloyd intel. 
 Yes. 
 Emily sent us the preview.

 No, Senator, we do not. 
 We believe that would hinder our investigation.

 The President has already classified this intel?

 If he's already decided... 
 This meeting's a formality.

 Three at every exit between his present location and Annapolis.

 Did you leak information to the press about today's meeting? 
 Sir? 
 Because it was a national security briefing. 
 That's why the intel's classified. 
 I'm aware of that, sir. 
 But you thought it was all right to use the press to spread a fake story about the reason for the meeting, because you knew I couldn't deny it.

 - that we should take the treat seriously. 
 - Tom: I am. 
 Should we be considering an evacuation? 
 Not practical. 
 We have two hours. 
 We have no idea of the range of any of the missiles that he might have in there, so we couldn't define a geographical area. 
 Tell me what you know about the bunker. 
 He had it ready and waiting before he fled to Europe. 
 If everything didn't work out, he could use it as the site of his last stand. 
 Imaging puts the walls at at least feet thick... 
 Solid concrete means that we can't scan the interior. 
 It's also sturdy enough to withstand conventional explosives. 
 We could wire the bunker with high-grade munitions. 
 That would take hours. 
 The perimeter is lined with cameras. 
 - He'd see us coming. 
 - And act accordingly. 
 But Director Foerstel's correct about the type of ordnance that we would need. 
 We not only have to breach the bunker... 
 Sarin has to be incinerated at a temperature high enough to neutralize biological compounds. 
 Well, there are a finite number of ways to deliver that sort of payload on a target quickly.
