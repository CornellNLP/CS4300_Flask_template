 Previously on Designated Survivor... 
 You honestly think this is worth $7 billion? 
 - I think it's worth a lot more. 
 - Damn right. 
 - I've never seen anyone this good. 
 - It's not work for him. 
 It's who he is. 
 Your story is not supposed to end here. 
 Let me bring you home. 
 Air Force One, prepare for departure! 
 It is imperative that we not become numb. 
 The people we serve, they have faces, families, hopes and dreams. 
 They are worthy of our sacrifice, our commitment. 
 Agent Wells, until further notice, you will be reporting to me. 
 As long as we're following the same breadcrumbs, 
- we might as well pool our resources. 
 - Agreed. 
 You lied to me about everything. 
 These last few days have been awful. 
 I will take tonight off and make it up to you. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 Do you have any reaction to the front-page profile in today's Times  - on Evan Beeman? 
 - I didn't read it. 
 But you read the Times, right? 
 Articles that I'm interested in. 
 But an article on the man who killed my wife  because he ran a red light while texting isn't one of them. 
 And you didn't attend his sentencing hearing either, right? 
 - No. 
 - Why not? 
 Because I'm President of the United States. 
 It wouldn't have brought my wife back. 
 I still want to talk to you about your reaction to Alex's death. 
 Sorry to interrupt, Mr. 
 President. 
 The delegation is here. 
 Thank you. 
 We'll have to reschedule. 
 My office will be in touch. 
 - Good. 
 I can suggest another therapist. 
 - Excuse me? 
 You wanted to see me after your wife died. 
 But every time I raise her death, you change the subject,  cut the conversation short, reschedule the session. 
 Just so we're clear, I didn't want to see you. 
 My senior staff demanded it,  and, if in case you haven't noticed, I have a rather busy job. 
 If you're too busy for our sessions, then let's discontinue them. 
 If you want to continue seeing me, we'll finish this one today. 
 And we'll talk about what happened to you when your wife died. 
 Because that matters. 
 Fine. 
 You wanna finish today's session, you'll have to wait. 
 - I've cleared my schedule. 
 - Good for you. 
 I'm still getting questions about the First Lady's memorial. 
 - Like what? 
 - Why isn't there one? 
 You can't have a memorial without a headstone. 
 Other question is why she doesn't have a headstone. 
 - It's only been ten weeks. 
 - Hey,  you know what else has happened in the past ten weeks? 
 Nothing. 
 - Lyor... 
 - He came right back to work  after the First Lady's death, and now he's President Hamlet. 
 He's right, Em. 
 I mean, the military spending bill is stuck on the President's desk,  judicial nominations are piling up,  and he's put the brakes on every major policy initiative. 
 Including foreign ones. 
 He canceled trips to Beijing and Jerusalem,  - bailed on the IMF meeting. 
 - This is turning into the ghost presidency. 
 Okay, you all need to relax. 
 The man just lost his wife, the mother of his children. 
 - It takes a while to recover from that. 
 - Understood, but the world keeps moving,  and the White House is getting left behind. 
 Not today. 
 It's the Cuban initiative. 
 - It'll jump-start us. 
 - Good, 'cause we're flatlining. 
 The FBI has completed its internal review. 
 Now, the good news is,  they've officially determined Damian Rennett was a clean shot. 
 - Took them ten weeks to figure that out? 
 - It took them ten weeks to decide  whether to fire you or put you on probation. 
 If IAD had a problem with my reaction,  why don't you ask how many of them have shot someone in the chest. 
 Or how many of them were sleeping with the person they shot? 
 - Oh. 
 Okay, don't need this. 
 - Hannah... 
 It's probation. 
 And before you tell us to stick it, understand this. 
 They never found Damian's body or figured out why he was in league with the Russians. 
 The one thing we do know is you two were involved,  which means you're gonna have to earn our trust back. 
 One more thing, Hannah. 
 I'm asking... 
 I'm asking as a friend. 
 You took out someone you cared for. 
 Are you okay? 
 I was okay the second I shot that son of a bitch. 
 You ready for Havana? 
 Yeah, my first job back and I'm a glorified babysitter. 
 And I'll be babysitting you. 
 President Ortega, this is an historic moment. 
 Our trade delegation is looking forward to meeting with you in Havana  to discuss improving bilateral relations. 
 Thank you, Mr. President. 
 I hope this is the first step  in the continuing loosening of financial and travel restrictions. 
 A new era of cooperation. 
 We're all hoping for that, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Senator Sanchez, congratulations. 
 This trip would not be happening without your tenacity. 
 And your willingness to listen, sir. 
 I hope investments can do what 50 years of failed US policy couldn't. 
 - So do I. 
 Congratulations, gentlemen. 
 - Thank you. 
 Congratulations. 
 Hey! 
 Talking points for the Cuba trip. 
 The president's getting criticism for giving Ortega oxygen. 
 Okay, so we make the trip about the Cuban people. 
 Yearning for freedom. 
 Reaching out to an America that they hope reaches back. 
 You might have a future in this. 
 Hey... 
 Turks and Caicos? 
 - Haven't looked at the brochure yet. 
 - Okay. 
 Deposit on the villa's due at midnight. 
 Come here. 
 I don't know if I can swing this right now. 
 - We've talked about a trip for months. 
 - I know. 
 And no offense, but your last vacation involved a horse and buggy. 
 - Oh! 
 - You deserve a break. 
 We both do. 
 Plus, I'm even more charming on vacation. 
 - You won't be able to handle it. 
 - The brochure. 
 Got it. 
 Do you have a strategy? 
 - A strategy for what? 
 - For processing everything. 
 The story you tell yourself about what happened to Alex. 
 I know exactly what happened. 
 But there's what happened and your consciousness of it. 
 For example, who do you blame for Alex's death? 
 Evan Beeman killed my wife. 
 That's who's responsible, but who do you blame? 
 I know this is gonna change everything for us. 
 But I have to do it. 
 If I don't... 
 I just have to. 
 You still on my side? 
 I'm always on your side... 
 Mr. President. 
 You wanted to be president. 
 Given the circumstances, it was my duty. 
 So, yes. 
 Do you think Alex'd still be alive, if you turned the job down? 
 Yes. 
 The president of the United States is asking you to serve. 
 This is an opportunity of a lifetime. 
 We'd have to move. 
 The kids would have to find new schools, start over. 
 We all would. 
 This would really change our lives. 
 In ways we can't even imagine. 
 Okay, there are times to say no, but this is not one of them. 
 So Alex was the reason you took the HUD job. 
 Meaning you wouldn't have been the designated survi... 
 You won't get me to blame my wife for her own death. 
 - That's not what I'm trying to do. 
 - Then what are you trying to do?! 
 Getting you to accept that causation is complicated,  that every decision has an antecedent. 
 She... 
 She was my wife. 
 She supported me. 
 She had my back. 
 But the choice was mine. 
 I'm the reason we stayed here. 
 That's the only antecedent that matters. 
 Now, my Florida district is 32% Cuban, so I had to take this trip. 
 That doesn't mean I support the president and his failed policies. 
 We need lower taxes, more prisons, more aircraft carriers,  not a president who suddenly can't make up his mind. 
 If he doesn't shut up, I'll shoot him. 
 Kirkman the Un-Decider. 
 We should call him that. 
 Hey, Congressman, if you're feeding off the president's trough,  ease up on the criticism. 
 - No offense, Aaron. 
 I just call it as I see 'em. 
 - Call 'em somewhere else. 
 Please, this is a trade mission, not a campaign stop. 
 - How was that? 
 - I still think I should shoot him. 
 Put that away. 
 Why? 
 That guy has a semi-automatic. 
 The other one's got a Beretta. 
 - This guy's carrying a Glock. 
 - Nothing standard issue? 
 No, they're not CRAF. 
 I am General Ramon Bravo,  and you are all prisoners  of the Army for the Liberation of the People. 
 - Where did you leave your White House ID? 
 - I left it on the bus. 
 We're very glad to have a White House official with us. 
 "The United States once supported the Cuban people  and their democratic aspirations. 
 But now President Kirkman props up a brutal and corrupt regime. 
 The price for this treachery is $500 million by tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. 
 or the delegation of traitors will be executed."   
 - Who are these people? 
 - We're trying to get a handle on that. 
 Army for the Liberation of the People. 
 It's a guerrilla movement. 
 30,000 soldiers. 
 - Rebels. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 40 years of skirmishes, but they haven't made much headway. 
 - Seems they've upped their game. 
 - President Ortega is on the line. 
 Mr. 
 President, how did this happen? 
 I don't know. 
 This delegation was a closely held secret. 
 Maybe the ELP has a spy in your administration. 
 Maybe someone in your delegation publicized the trip. 
 I'm not interested in assigning blame right now. 
 I'm interested in getting our people back. 
 I have already reached out to Ramon Bravo through intermediaries,  and he has not responded. 
 Where are the hostages being held? 
 The rebel base of operations is the Sierra de los Organos mountains,  a few hours outside of Havana. 
 But the leaders move constantly. 
 They're hard to pinpoint. 
 Dense tree cover. 
 Satellite imagery doesn't reveal much. 
 That region is very difficult to access,  especially with the men and resources at my disposal. 
 I understand. 
 We'll need your available intel. 
 Of course. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Senator, get the congressional leadership  - over to the White House. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 I want options on my desk as soon as possible, General. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Thank you. 
 What are they talking about? 
 They're talking about killing us. 
 - Excuse me? 
 - What are you... 
 Would you consider releasing the women and the elderly? 
 What did you say to me? 
 You don't need 20 captives. 
 Half could be released. 
 The gesture of goodwill would go a long way. 
 The assistant to the national security advisor has a big mouth. 
 Perhaps I should shut it. 
 - Maybe I'll shut yours, too! 
 - Stop, please. 
 Please just stop, okay? 
 There is no need for this. 
 We're here to do exactly as you ask. 
 You're Phillip Cross, the businessman? 
 Yes, that's right, and maybe I can help you make a deal. 
 You think I wanna hear what a capitalist pig like you has to say? 
 Break his finger! 
 Hannah, keep a low profile. 
 If they realize who you are, you're dead. 
 They're not going to. 
 I'm getting out of here. 
 Our fleet's in place. 
 JSOC's recommendation is a ground assault, backed by our naval assets. 
 Kendra, what's the legality of military action  against rebels in another country? 
 If American lives are at stake, the rules of war allow it,  especially if the foreign sovereign is unwilling or unable to act. 
 With Ortega, can I assume the latter? 
 No, it's both. 
 He doesn't have the firepower. 
 Even if he did, he can't be seen as actively helping America to attack Cuban citizens,  even those that oppose him. 
 His grip on power is loose enough as it is. 
 He won't stand in our way. 
 I've interfaced with his top advisors. 
 Ortega has given us access to his ports. 
 General, is your opinion that military action will secure the hostages' release? 
 Sir, our consensus is that a show of overwhelming force  will bring the rebels to heel. 
 - You can't guarantee it? 
 - No, sir, but perhaps a SEAL team... 
 What other options do I have, aside from military? 
 - Ransom... 
 - Which is a non-starter. 
 No, Lyor, the killing of Americans is a non-starter. 
 We've got congressmen, senators, business leaders,  my national security advisor. 
 This is a mess. 
 We're running out of time. 
 I want options. 
 Come on, people! 
 - What about a recon mission? 
 - That's good. 
 We can buttress our data. 
 We'll know what we're getting into if you deploy military assets. 
 It could still be mistaken as aggression. 
 What about a camera-equipped drone? 
 Won't work because of the canopy, but a Black Hawk, infrared cameras, low altitude... 
 - A single one? 
 - Yes, sir. 
 Okay. 
 Let's find out what we're really dealing with. 
 Try it. 
 He wants assurances. 
 Guarantees. 
 You know what that sounds like? 
 Yeah, a president who's gun-shy,  which is exactly what he's been since the First Lady's death. 
 The problem is, if you don't risk anyone... 
 - You risk everyone. 
 - Yeah. 
 Mr. Boone? 
 - Please don't do that. 
 - Do what? 
 I'm carrying hot coffee. 
 If you startle me and I spill it on myself, cardiac arrest. 
 2% of all males under 40 die from a heart attack triggered by a liquid burn. 
 - I don't think that's true. 
 - It could be. 
 Sir, I'm Tricia Sims. 
 You're interviewing me today for the assistant job? 
 - Come back. 
 - I've come back three times. 
 You're obviously good at coming back. 
 Maybe that's your thing. 
 I promise I won't take much of your time. 
 I can promise you that, too. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 And... 
 hmm. 
 You're good on paper. 
 - You know what else is good on paper? 
 - No, sir. 
 Ink. 
 And ink smudges. 
 It fades. 
 It's temporary, just like all my assistants,  because this job is very demanding. 
 It requires perfection. 
 I understand, sir. 
 Good. 
 Let's get you started, then, on a trial basis. 
 As you may know, the president is an architect. 
 He's been searching for the original blueprint  of the Capitol forever. 
 - I see why it would mean a lot to him. 
 - Which is why I want you to hunt it down. 
 Start with Madge in Records. 
 She knows everything. 
 Will do. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 - Oh, and... 
 Tricia. 
 - Yes? 
 You know what else causes heart attacks in men under 40? 
 No, sir. 
 Failure. 
 Yeah. 
 No, we'll do the photo op with the CHC after the delegation returns. 
 After. 
 Sir, the Black Hawk's on course. 
 This is Tango One. 
 We're picking up a heat signature. 
 2-3-7 north by 8-2-4 west. 
 Tango One, extend your perimeter. 
 - General? 
 - It's a pretty remote location. 
 Something's there, but we can't tell yet whether it's a generator, furnace or installation. 
 We have incoming... 
 What just happened? 
 Tango One, this is Motherboard. 
 Do you copy? 
 Tango One, this is Motherboard. 
 Do you copy? 
 We just lost Tango One, sir. 
 There were no casualties, okay? 
 The crew managed to pilot the damaged Black Hawk to a nearby carrier. 
 O'Neil? 
 Why did the rescue mission fail? 
 It was not a rescue mission, it was a peaceable recon mission. 
 Which is no longer secret. 
 Aren't the hostages in greater danger? 
 The president's doing all he can to secure their safe return. 
 I'll let you know when I have more. 
 When Corwin asked if the Black Hawk meant the president wasn't battle-tested,  you said, "No, because it wasn't a battle."  
 - Which was accurate. 
 - But a bit flip. 
 The Chronicle's coverage of the Administration has been unfriendly. 
 - We need to court them a bit more. 
 - Okay. 
 When Deveraux asked if the president  was accepting counsel from the secretary of defense... 
 I said the president's decision-making... 
 Isn't for public debate, which is true, but so combative. 
 - I was taking fire in there. 
 - You can't fire back. 
 My options are limited. 
 I'm defending an administration  that hasn't taken decisive action on anything in the last ten weeks. 
 You can't defend us if you're taking the bait. 
 Okay. 
 Less flip. 
 Don't take the bait. 
 Don't fire back. 
 Duly noted. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello, Tom Kirkman's voicemail. 
 This is Tom Kirkman's wife,  who is no longer the subject or target of a federal investigation. 
 I beat it. 
 We beat it. 
 And the only thing I want to say to you is I love you. 
 Hello, Tom Kirkman's voicemail. 
 This is Tom Kirkman's wife,  who is no longer the subject or target of a federal investigation. 
 So your kids, how are they handling things? 
 We're not here to talk about my kids. 
 We're here to talk about you,  but your kids are a big part of your life, right? 
 Penny? 
 Sweetheart, I need you to wake up. 
 Dad? 
 Come here, darling, please. 
 Sit up. 
 I don't know how to do this. 
 Dad, what's wrong? 
 There... 
 There has been a terrible accident. 
 Mommy was in a terrible accident. 
 And sometimes accidents are so bad that... 
 that the people who are in them, they can't come home. 
 Mommy's not coming home? 
 No, sweetheart. 
 She's in heaven now, with the angels. 
 Why isn't Mommy coming home? 
 - I'm sorry, sweetheart. 
 - I want to see my mom. 
 - I know. 
 - I want my mommy. 
 I know. 
 I know. 
 I know. 
 Penny reacted like you'd expect any little girl to react,  who had just been told her mother was killed. 
 How did Leo react? 
 She's gone, Leo. 
 Come here. 
 She hated it here. 
 You should have never brought us here. 
 I watched his youth vanish before my eyes in a second. 
 That must have been difficult. 
 Yeah, it was. 
 You know, Tom, there is no one way  for a person in Leo's position to react, or a little girl. 
 It's different for everybody. 
 But what I find interesting is, ten weeks in,  - you're finally opening up about your kids. 
 - What are you getting at? 
 Why were you so reluctant to talk about your children? 
 They're not the ones in therapy. 
 No, you are, and you were protecting them, which is a way of protecting yourself. 
 From what? 
 If you don't share their reactions, you don't have to share yours  and the one thing you don't want to confront. 
 Which is? 
 Grief. 
 I grieve for my wife every day. 
 - Do you grieve in public? 
 - No. 
 - So, in private? 
 - Yes. 
 - Have you cried? 
 - What the hell does that matter? 
 Because grief is a ritual, and if you don't engage in it,  - either in public or... 
 - What the hell do you expect of me? 
 It's what you expect of yourself, Tom. 
 And if you think your behavior is adaptive,  I'm not sure why you wanna see me. 
 And don't tell me it's because your staff made you. 
 Excuse me. 
 I need to use the bathroom. 
 Yeah. 
 No, I never voted with Tom Kirkman for anything. 
 You can look it up. 
 I'm one of his fiercest critics. 
 I'm here for Cuba, not Ortega. 
 Unlike Kirkman, I believe in the rule of the people. 
 Unlike President Kirkman? 
 - You son of a bitch! 
 - Come on! 
 He doesn't know what he's talking about! 
 I'll make sure the president knows what a self-serving traitor you are! 
 Shut up and sit down now! 
 Shut up! 
 Sit back down! 
 Sit back down and shut up! 
 Stop it! 
 ...the Caymans are too close. 
 Of course. 
 Okay. 
 We should go back in. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, okay. 
 So, you told the president there's no legal bar to ransom? 
 Correct, the executive branch has absolute discretion. 
 Which he would set a dangerous precedent by exercising it. 
 - Which is exactly what I told him. 
 - What did he say? 
 That America hasn't faced the execution of hostages,  including six senators and five congressmen. 
 That he'd rather be criticized for how he kept them alive  - than how he let them die. 
 - What did you say? 
 That the old Tom Kirkman would have advocated military action. 
 That his tentative behavior could get more people killed. 
 - You didn't tell him that. 
 - Of course not, I like my job. 
 Okay, so if it's ransom, we need congressional support. 
 - Senator Sanchez is our power broker here. 
 - She's on her way. 
 - We're getting Aaron back. 
 - Yeah, safe and sound. 
 Let's make it happen. 
 Sit. 
 - Are you all right? 
 - Yeah. 
 - I want her dead. 
 - Hey, listen. 
 Don't do that again. 
 They'll kill you. 
 I can take care of myself. 
 Hannah, he's right. 
 They're talking about what to do with you next. 
 None of the options are good. 
 We have nothing to do with her. 
 Segregate the cooperatives from the ones who aren't. 
 Hey, Congressman, sit down and shut up. 
 - Jackass. 
 - I know, but he's not the problem, Aaron. 
 Cross is. 
 - What are you talking about? 
 - He's working with them, Aaron. 
 I've reached out to congressional leadership. 
 We feel ransom is ill-advised. 
 And you've made my case? 
 I promised my colleagues I'd make my case to you. 
 Military... 
 - We already discussed this. 
 - Mr. President... 
 My goal is to save lives, not cost them. 
 Military action will result in casualties. 
 Writing a check we can afford won't. 
 You don't know that, sir. 
 Tell the leadership if this goes south, I'll take full responsibility,  but this is what we're doing. 
 Emily, reach out to Treasury. 
 Put this in motion. 
 Yes, sir. 
 So, ransom it is. 
 In the last two months, he's withdrawn 50% of our troops from Iraq and Syria. 
 He's introduced a bill to double the budget for Homeland Security. 
 And now ransom. 
 He's trying to protect everyone. 
 You know what you call that? 
 Trauma. 
 
 
 
 I'm sorry. 
 Is that a question? 
 Do you think your wife's death traumatized you? 
 - I think you know the answer to that. 
 - But do you? 
 Do you want Alex to have a state funeral? 
 No. 
 - A private one, then? 
 - Yes. 
 The existing plot at Westchester Cedars? 
 That'll be fine. 
 I have the... 
 I have the guest list for you to look over,  as well as some flower arrangements and the obituaries. 
 I'm sorry, what did you say? 
 The guest list, the flowers and the obituaries. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you, Emily. 
 Of course my wife's death traumatized me. 
 Why's it so important I acknowledge that to you? 
 Do you think it's important? 
 I think, for $800 an hour, you shouldn't ask such obvious questions. 
 You're right. 
 You should be asking yourself. 
 But I will make an observation. 
 You're the president. 
 To do your job, you need a clear head. 
 If you bring unresolved emotion into the decisional... 
 I don't. 
 Unintentionally, Tom. 
 But that's the problem. 
 It's what you're doing unintentionally. 
 - Ten-hut! 
 - As you were. 
 Secretary Braden said the funds have been made available. 
 All that remains is for you to okay the wire transfer. 
 Where do we stand on the release of the hostages? 
 We have Ramon Bravo's promise to put them on a bus  to Martí International Airport, once he confirms receipt of the funds. 
 Can we corroborate that there's a bus at the site? 
 - No, we cannot. 
 - We won't be able to corroborate anything. 
 The essence of ransom is blind faith. 
 Bravo will either keep his word or he won't. 
 Mr. President... 
 If you bring unresolved emotion into the decisional... 
 - I don't. 
 - Unintentionally, Tom. 
 - General, cancel the wire transfer. 
 - Sir. 
 - How long to get your men ashore? 
 - 45 minutes. 
 Bring the fleet in as close to land as possible. 
 If a show of force doesn't get the insurgents to back down,  - send in the Marines. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 I'll have a congressional statement of support  - ready to issue. 
 - Good. 
 What the hell just happened? 
 He made the hard decision, but the right one. 
 I think the president's back. 
 Hallelujah. 
 What are you doing? 
 I talked to Madge, who told me to check with Earl... 
 In the basement? 
 Yes, and Earl sent me to the records annex. 
 - You got these from the annex? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 No one's opened that room in 50 years. 
 It's a breeding ground for black mold. 
 Look. 
 - Black mold? 
 - Stachybotrys chartarum. 
 It can cause serious respiratory illness. 
 Do this in a contained environment with a mask and a hazmat suit. 
 - The president needs... 
 - Emily, this is Tricia Sims. 
 She was down in the annex. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I hope you were wearing a hazmat suit. 
 It was nice meeting you. 
 - You didn't hear them talking about it. 
 - I didn't need to. 
 - Maybe he was trying to broker a deal. 
 - It was too familiar for that, Aaron. 
 - Well, they broke his hand. 
 - Did they? 
 Hey. 
 - Thanks. 
 - Enough! 
 Sit down! 
 Everyone sit down. 
 You're right. 
 He didn't seem to have a problem with his broken hand. 
 Get up. 
 Get up. 
 Get up. 
 Hey, hey. 
 What... 
 The payment has not been made. 
 I see you've moved your fleet into place. 
 You doubt my resolve. 
 So, I will begin killing the hostages,  and I'll start with this spy, Hannah Wells. 
 Mr. 
 Bravo, I'm prepared to keep one of two promises. 
 The first was to act as an arbiter, between you and President Ortega  - so you could air your grievances. 
 - Wire the money now or I will kill her. 
 The second is if you hurt one hostage, we will hunt you down,  we will find you and we will kill you. 
 Wait! 
 Wait, please. 
 Please, just... 
 Please, wait. 
 I'll pay the ransom. 
 I'll pay the ransom! 
 Every penny of it. 
 Let her go. 
 Please just let us go. 
 Mr. President, Hannah's signaling us. 
 How do you figure? 
 She's not Catholic, but just did the sign of the cross. 
 The hostage offering to pay the ransom is Phillip Cross  - of Cross International Development. 
 - Look into it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 General, if the hostages aren't free in the next 30 minutes,  - I want our troops to make landfall. 
 - Yes, Mr. President. 
 Cross' passport shows six visits to Cuba in the past two years. 
 - To do what? 
 - I don't know, but I ran his cell. 
 Excuse me. 
 Get this. 
 He's called Ramon Bravo 12 times since August. 
 His captor. 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 Unless they're in on this together. 
 Cross is a billionaire. 
 He doesn't need the ransom. 
 Exactly. 
 Which is why the ransom could be a ruse. 
 His company specializes in resorts, right? 
 Cuba will be the Caribbean Riviera when it opens for investment. 
 Maybe he funded the rebels in exchange for land rights,  which would be worth billions. 
 But why would he think that Bravo could give him real estate? 
 - The ELP hasn't made headway in decades. 
 - Maybe Cross was hedging his bets,  backing both horses until one pulled ahead. 
 You need to check if Cross was also coordinating with Ortega. 
 - Is there a way to dump his phones? 
 - Yup. 
 We were looking for connections between Ortega and Cross. 
 We found something very different. 
 I don't believe it. 
 Those phone records prove Ortega and Bravo conspired to frame the rebels. 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 It does if you put yourself in Bravo's shoes. 
 He's 75. 
 A life of struggle has gotten him nothing. 
 So, he kidnaps our delegation. 
 He has to know there will be a military response,  one that will destroy the rebels. 
 Ortega is paying him off. 
 So Bravo gets money, a financial legacy for his family. 
 Cross' price for delivering the delegation is development rights worth billions. 
 And Ortega gets to hold on to power just as soon as we destroy the ELP. 
 I know President Ortega. 
 He wouldn't endanger Americans this way. 
 Senator Sanchez, if you do this long enough,  you realize you don't really know anyone. 
 I am pleased to announce the delegation's plane  has left Martí Airport. 
 I'm very glad to hear it. 
 But the ELP must be destroyed for this treachery. 
 - We need America's help. 
 - You're not gonna get it, sir. 
 I don't understand. 
 Phillip Cross has already been debriefed. 
 He confessed. 
 - Confessed to what? 
 - Your collusion with Ramon Bravo. 
 The evidence has been uploaded to the official Cuban news agency website. 
 Phone records, bank payments. 
 All for the Cuban people to see. 
 We don't even have to bring you both to justice. 
 We're gonna let your people do it for us. 
 Good luck, Mr. President. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 I have the latest draft of talking points on Cuba for your approval. 
 "United States supports Cuban self-determination. 
 With the overthrow of President Ortega and the ouster of Ramon Bravo..."  "...we look forward to a democratic future for the Cuban people."  I'll make some changes and get back to you. 
 All right. 
 So, Turks and Caicos... 
 - I don't think it's a good idea. 
 - I figured you didn't. 
 It's why you have problems with my press briefing. 
 It's why you give me notes on things you never note. 
 You're trying to tell me that something's wrong without telling me. 
 What are we doing here, Seth? 
 - We're dating. 
 - I know. 
 It was two days a week. 
 And then the First Lady died and it became five. 
 If it's too fast, too soon... 
 No... 
 I like it. 
 I just don't know what it is. 
 Alright. 
 Your use of indefinite pronouns isn't helping here. 
 It's like we flipped a switch. 
 And I am not a switch flipper. 
 Okay. 
 If you're saying that things are moving too fast,  and you wanna roll it back to once a week, that's fine. 
 - That day will be the best day of my week. 
 - Seth... 
 But if you're trying to tell me that you're not sure about it,  about us... 
 Then I need you to just say that. 
 I'm saying I don't know. 
 Well, I do. 
 And when you do, give me a call. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yeah. 
 No. 
 All right, the answer's been no for six weeks. 
 It's still no. 
 So, about the blueprint. 
 You can call off the dogs now. 
 - I can? 
 - Yeah. 
 The point of the task wasn't to find the blueprint. 
 - It wasn't? 
 - No. 
 This job is about perseverance and learning to navigate  a mind-numbing bureaucracy. 
 - An interesting introduction to it... 
 - Here it is, Mr. Boone. 
 What? 
 The papers of the architect who designed the Capitol  aren't the White House. 
 They're in the National Archives. 
 They wouldn't let me take them, so I took high-res pictures,  had them color corrected and enlarged. 
 Polychromatic paper. 
 - Smart. 
 - Can I tell you something, Mr. Boone? 
 After finding this blueprint, you can tell me a few things. 
 My dad works in construction. 
 My mom, she cleans houses. 
 They worked their whole lives to send me to college,  and now I have a job at the White House. 
 The White House. 
 I will find the blueprints to Atlantis if you ask me. 
 Oh, I will. 
 She called me, you know. 
 - When? 
 - Right before she was killed. 
 Left me a message. 
 Said she loved me. 
 I never got to say it back. 
 How were things left between you two? 
 It was a tough time. 
 We weren't in the best place. 
 What place do you think you're in now? 
 I don't know. 
 I do. 
 You're standing still. 
 You console your children, not yourself. 
 You can't read about your wife's killer. 
 You can't pick her headstone. 
 You hold yourself responsible. 
 You're angry. 
 I'm not dealing with any of it. 
 No, you're not. 
 You need to find a concrete way to acknowledge your grief. 
 To move on. 
 If you don't, you'll just be treading water. 
 And you know what happens to someone who treads water for too long? 
 They drown. 
 I have to do this on my own, Mike. 
 Mr. Beeman, given the circumstances,  would you say your treatment here has been fair? 
 Yes, sir. 
 - Food sufficient? 
 - Yes, sir. 
 They've protected you from other inmates? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Good. 
 Because your well-being is of paramount importance to me. 
 Do you know why? 
 No, sir. 
 Because I want you to remember  every single day for the rest of your life what you took from me. 
 The one person I lived for, my wife,  mother of my children, my best friend, the best part of me,  and you did it for nothing, for absolutely no reason. 
 And I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure  you think about that  every day for the rest of your life. 
 We need to talk.
