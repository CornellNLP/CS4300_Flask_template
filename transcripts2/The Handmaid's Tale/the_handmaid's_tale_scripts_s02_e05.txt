 [compressor bangs]   
 [Offred]  Previously, on "The Handmaid's Tale"...   
 [aunt Lydia] June will be chained in this room until she gives birth.   
 And then June will be executed.   
 Offred has an opportunity.   
 [Commander Fred] 
 It wasn't easy finding you.   
 But we were determined to rescue you from your kidnappers.   
 Uh-huh.    
 [gasping] Ninety-two days!    
 Janine.    
 Hi.    
 Hi!    
 [Serena] Nick! 
The guests are arriving soon.    
 Can you please make sure that everything is ready?    
 Yes, ma'am.    
 Ofglen!    
 They cut out her tongue.    
 After she stood up for Janine.    
 [aunt Lydia]  I believe you know him.   
 He drove a bread delivery truck.    
 [Offred shuddering]    
 [aunt Lydia]  Whose fault was it? Offred?   
 June did this.    
 Not Offred.    
 Offred does not have to bear June's guilt.   
 [Offred]  My fault.   
 My fault.   
 We've been sent good weather.   
 We've been sent good weather.   
 We've been sent good weather.   
 [dog barking faintly]    
 - [opens faucet] 
- [water running]    
 Hey. What are you doing?    
 I'm not allowed to have these.    
 June.    
 I'm not supposed to be out of my room at night.    
 [Nick sighs]    
 - [opens faucet] 
- [water gushes out]    
 [closes faucet]    
     pounds. Very good.    
 Step off, dear.    
 How is the pregnancy rhinitis? 
Runny nose all gone?    
 Better than before.    
 Now for the fundal height.    
 Twenty-five centimeters.    
 Right on track.    
 [scoffs] Special dispensation for Aunts.    
 Really, a burden more than anything.    
 Would you take some tea before you go?    
 [aunt Lydia] That would be lovely, thank you.    
 Offred, you're a bit musty, dear.    
 The hormones.    
 You'll start taking two baths a day.    
 But not too warm. Understand?    
 [Offred] Yes, Aunt Lydia.    
 [aunt Lydia] When was your last bowel movement?    
 Yesterday around lunchtime, wasn't it?    
 Yes, Mrs. Waterford.    
 I'll go see about that tea.    
 Quitting is very hard.    
 I used to smoke, too, once upon a time.    
 I'm pleased that everything is going so well with the baby.    
 As our doctor would happily tell you.    
 Have I let myself become a bother?    
 There's so much more to a successful pregnancy than can be measured in a doctor's office.    
 The ventilation in the Handmaid's room, the firmness of the bed.    
 The mood in the household.    
 Her attitude seems much improved.    
 It's everything a Wife could ask for.    
 She's quite unlike herself.    
 Mrs. Waterford, no small effort has been made to bring Offred to heel.    
 Your baby needs to know he's in a Godly, harmonious environment.    
 Of course.    
 Praised be His miracle.    
 How do you take your tea?    
 I'm afraid I won't have time after all.    
 Busy day. More visits to make.    
 I'll see myself out. 
See you soon, I hope.    
 Blessed day.    
 [aunt Lydia] Blessed day.    
 [Commander Fred] Good morning, Aunt.    
 Oh, Blessed morning, Commander Waterford.    
 [Commander Fred] Everything in order?    
 Your baby is just as healthy as can be.    
 And Offred?    
 The Handmaid is well, too.    
 - Praised be. 
- Yes.    
 Let me take that out for you.    
 Thank you, Commander.    
 Hard to believe we're going to have a baby in the house in just a few months.    
 [aunt Lydia] The days will fly by, you'll see.    
 Too soon to tell if it's a boy or a girl, I suppose. [chuckles]    
 - I'll take that for you, sir. 
- Thank you.     
 We won't know until God brings the little angel into the world, of course.     
 But I have a feeling he'll be a fine boy just like his father.     
 [chuckles]     
 Yes. What man doesn't want a son?     
 [both chuckle]     
 Did you know your baby is the size of a papaya now?     
 A papaya. Is that right?     
 [car door opens]     
 - [aunt Lydia] Thank you. 
- Of course.     
 [car door closes]     
 [engine starts]     
 [Unwomen singing prayers]     
 [Unwomen coughing]     
 [Unwomen continue singing prayers]     
 Only two.     
 They look like they're sleeping.     
 You know Sally used to be a rabbi?     
 That's why she does it, so she can say a blessing.     
 [Emily] Bed detail gets an egg at breakfast.     
 You should volunteer.     
 No, no. I don't want to do that.     
 You'll last longer.     
 That's up to God.     
 He holds me in the palm of His hand.     
 He couldn't hold you in His palm someplace else?     
 Like Bora-Bora?     
 Where's that?     
 It's one of the Leeward Islands in the South Pacific, near Tahiti.     
 It's so beautiful it doesn't look real.     
 Oh.     
 Well, He's got you, too, Emily.     
 He's got all of us.     
 Well, that's what Aunt Lydia says.     
 [Unwoman] Here.     
 [Aunt] Straight lines!     
 [whimpering]     
 [Fiona] Kit?     
 [Guardian] Get back up.     
 Come on! Keep moving!     
 [Kit wheezing]     
 Do you want something for the pain?     
 No. No, I don't.     
 Give it to someone who needs it.     
 You sure?     
 Yeah.     
 [Janine] Here.     
 - [Aunt] Eyes front! 
- [Emily] Thank you.     
 Are you gonna help Kit?     
 She doesn't want me to waste the medicine.     
 [Aunt] Keep moving!     
 Kit's dying?     
 We come here, we work, we die.     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 The mistress is waiting.     
 I'll be right there.     
 [footsteps recede]     
 [children calling out]     
 [Serena] Blessed be the fruit.     
 [Handmaids] May the Lord open.     
 [Serena] Do you know Ofzachary?     
 Not well, Mrs. Waterford.     
 She may be God's chosen vessel, but I'm surprised He wants to pass along that nose of hers.     
 [Naomi] Serena!     
 [children chattering indistinctly]     
 God's light be with you, Naomi, Grace.     
 [Naomi] And with you.     
 Oh, blessings on your sweet head, Angela.     
 [coos]     
 What a pretty girl.     
 [Naomi] Your shower was so charming.     
 I wish mine had been that intimate.     
 Ours was so overwhelming, my Marthas were cleaning up for days.     
 [Serena] I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.     
 [Grace] Did you have fun at the shower, dear?     
 Yes, Mrs. Scott.     
 [Angela cries]     
 Oh, don't cry, sweetheart.     
 Is she all right?     
 Just teething.     
 God's testing me, I know it.     
 [Angela continues crying]     
 We should be going.     
 [Serena] Under His eye.     
 Under His eye.     
 [indistinct chatter over radio]     
 She never misses a chance to complain about that baby, does she?     
 No, Mrs. Waterford.     
 These walks are for both of us.     
 So that the baby can hear my voice.     
 I would appreciate it if I didn't have to make all the speeches.     
 All right?     
 Yes, Mrs. Waterford.     
 "Yes, Mrs. Waterford."     
 "No, Mrs. Waterford."     
 What is the matter with you?     
 Nothing, Mrs. Waterford.     
 How was your walk?     
 It was quite nice, thank you.     
 Offred, you may go to your room.     
 Mrs. Waterford.     
 Has Offred, uh...     
 I'm worried about the Handmaid.     
 The doctor says that she's in perfect health.     
 I mean her mental state.     
 Her mental state?     
 Maybe you should take her to see a different kind of doctor.     
 Did Offred ask you to talk to me?     
 No, ma'am.     
 Well, I don't know what to tell you.     
 She doesn't have anyone to look out for her.     
 It appears that she does.     
 The Handmaid is not your concern.     
 [footsteps recede]     
 [cutlery tinkling]     
 [Commander Fred] Morning, dear.     
 Good morning.     
 Warm-up, please, Rita.     
 [Rita] Some coffee, ma'am?     
 Yes, thank you.     
 We saw Mrs. Putnam and Mrs. Scott on our walk just now.     
 Mmm-hmm.     
 Nick was waiting for Offred and me when we got back.     
 Just making sure that we got home safe.     
 It's very sweet, how concerned he is about her.     
 Mmm-hmm.     
 And then a tour of the new Rachel and Leah Center in the afternoon.     
 Will it be ready by then?     
 Yes.     
 The Committee keeps hearing about overruns.     
 It'll be ready.     
 Also, I suggest homestays rather than a hotel.     
 A taste of true Gilead hospitality, something the Commanders can take back to their own districts.     
 Interesting.     
 I'll bring it up at my    o'clock.     
 Andrew. Andrew.     
 I have a personal request.     
 You know my driver?     
 [Andrew] Blaine? I believe so.     
 [Commander Fred] He's been with me for some years.     
 Very capable. Loyal.     
 He's overdue for a promotion.     
 Of course. I'll look into it.     
 I was thinking Washington.     
 The boy's got a lot of potential that I'm afraid he's wasting here.     
 I can see what's available. 
He's trustworthy?     
 Yeah, absolutely.     
 I'm surprised you'd let him go.     
 "A good man obtaineth the favor of the Lord, but a man of wicked devices will He condemn."     
 Psalms?     
 Proverbs.     
 If I were you, I'd find a way to keep him around.     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 I hope you're not too tired to go to the Prayvaganza.     
 You still would like to go, wouldn't you?     
 Yes, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Good.     
 Finish that up and we'll be on our way.     
 A second walk.     
 Aunt Lydia would be so proud of us.     
 [Serena sighs]     
 "Prayvaganza."     
 Not one of the Commander's better efforts, if you ask me.     
 Are you okay?     
 I'm fine, thank you.     
 [organ music playing]     
 Today is a day of thanksgiving.     
 Today we honor our most valiant Guardians.     
 [applause]     
 And we salute their victories on the field of battle and in the halls of our Divine Republic.     
 We praise your service and we reward your sacrifice.     
 He looks handsome, doesn't he?     
 [Andrew] "And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make him a help meet for him."     
 [Wives murmuring]     
 "And the rib, which the Lord God hath taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."     
 "Unto the woman He said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception, in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."     
 Do you accept this sacred duty?     
 [Guardians] I do.     
 I do.     
 [Andrew] As a token of this vow, you each shall give and receive a ring.     
 "Therefore, shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh."     
 I now pronounce you man and wife.     
 They look so beautiful.     
 [Andrew] "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, replenish the Earth."     
 May the Lord order your steps, now and all the days of your life.     
 I give you the happy couples.     
 [applause continues]     
 [inaudible applause]     
 [horse snorts]     
 [Aunt] Ten bags!     
 [grunting]     
 [panting]     
 Hey. We never had these in the grass where we used to live, remember?     
 Yeah, the Wives would never allow it. 
Imagine the gossip.     
 [chuckles]     
 
 
 
 Everything was so perfect.     
 I like them.     
 They're happy for everyone. 
They don't care who you are.     
 [blows]     
 What'd you wish for?     
 I can't tell you.     
 [Aunt] Keep going!     
 Why do you think God's looking out for you?     
 He saved my life.     
 Twice now.     
 There's got to be a reason.     
 [gasps]     
 [Kit gasps]     
 [grunts]     
 Kit! Kit, get up. Get up. Please.     
 Kit!     
 [aunt Pauline] Back to work!     
 Get up!     
 Get back to work!     
 [grunts]     
 [Kit coughs]     
 [Kit wheezing]     
 [Aunt] Back to work!     
 I wanna change my wish.     
 [grunts]     
 "Love is patient, love is kind.     
 It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.     
 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.     
 Love delights not in evil but rejoices with the truth.     
 It bears all things, believes all things, endures all things."     
 Love never fails.     
 Amen.     
 [softly] That was very nice, Nick.     
 Welcome to our home, Miss Spencer.     
 Eden.     
 [Commander Fred] Ah, but you're not Miss Spencer anymore.     
 Are you?     
 Welcome.     
 Thank you, Commander Waterford.     
 Mrs. Waterford.     
 God's truly smiled on you both.     
 [Commander Fred] We should celebrate.     
 Champagne.     
 Rita?     
 Of course, sir.     
 Husbands and wives only, I'm afraid.     
 Offred, you may go to your room.     
 So, that happened.     
 She's...     
 Young.     
 But not a moment to lose, I suppose.     
 Can I make you some cinnamon milk?     
 [Offred] No, thank you.     
 [shuddering]     
 [sighs]     
 [gasping]     
 [Unwomen coughing]     
 [quiet indistinct chatter]     
 [Sally] Come on.     
 Come and join us.     
 [Unwoman whispers] Let's go.     
 [Sally] Please come and join us.     
 Come closer.     
 Tonight we celebrate two lives, one love.     
 Fiona first met Kit when she arrived here    months ago.     
 They've rarely been apart since.     
 [Unwoman chuckles]     
 Fiona, do you take Kit to be your wedded wife, to love, to honor, and to cherish?     
 I do.     
 [Unwomen murmuring]     
 [Sally] And Kit, do you take Fiona to be your wedded wife, to love, to honor, and to cherish?     
 I do.     
 [giggles]     
 Hey!     
 This was my idea.     
 [Sally] Usually, the Seven Blessings, or the Sheva B'rachot, comes next.     
 I told her that they're not Jewish,  but she said that God doesn't care.     
 [Sally] Perhaps anyone who wants to could share...     
 I wanna stay.     
 Where are we going?     
 [Emily] What is wrong with you?     
 [Janine] What are you talking about?     
 [Emily] What if the Aunts saw us?     
 They could starve us. They could do a lot of things.     
 I'm trying to keep you alive.     
 [Janine] That's not up to you.     
 God's watching over us?     
 sh1t job He's doing.     
 Well, Aunt Lydia says we can't know everything he's thinking.     
 f*ck Aunt Lydia!     
 This place is hell!     
 And covering it up in flowers doesn't change anything!     
 Well, so what?     
 We come here, we work, we die.     
 Kit's going to die happy, so what's the problem?     
 Gilead took your eye.     
 They took my clit.     
 Now we're cows being worked to death, and you're dressing up the slaughterhouse for them.     
 That's the f*cking problem!     
 Cows don't get married.     
 We'll get the place spruced up, don't worry.     
 You have a beautiful house, Mrs. Waterford.     
 I'm so blessed to join your honored household.     
 May the Lord keep you and the Commander in his grace, and help guide me to...     
 Uh...     
 I forgot the rest. I'm sorry.     
 That's fine. Thank you.     
 Did your mother teach you to say that?     
 Yes.     
 I hope you had a chance to say goodbye to her.     
 Just for a minute, before she took the bus back home.     
 We have a farm a few hours north of here, near Westminster.     
 It's a real small town, not like here.     
 You have such a beautiful house.     
 Did your mother tell you what to expect tonight when you lie with him?     
 Good.     
 It is your duty to bear children.     
 But also, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine."     
 I don't understand.     
 The act.     
 Lying together.     
 It can feel wonderful for you as well as for him.     
 But lust is a sin.     
 Not between husband and wife.     
 It can bring you closer together.     
 It should, anyway.     
 Okay.     
 Welcome.     
 Good night, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Good night, Mrs. Blaine.     
 [Commander Fred] A good woman will lift you up.     
 You'll see.     
 To good women.     
 To good women.     
 I'm glad this could be arranged so quickly.     
 I had to pull a few strings, but I couldn't miss the opportunity to show you how much I appreciate all you've done for me.     
 Well, thank you, sir. I'm grateful.     
 You're on your way now, son.     
 [sighs]     
 Gilead values the family, and rewards those who live by those values.     
 By God's grace, I'll have a child of my own someday, sir.     
 By God's grace.     
 [inaudible]     
 [Fiona sniffles]     
 It was a beautiful wedding.     
 [Sally reciting prayer in Hebrew]     
 [all]  Amein.   
 [distorted fetal heartbeat]     
 [footsteps]     
 [monitor beeps faintly]     
 Oh, thank God.     
 Thank God.     
 I'll get the doctor.     
 You're tough, aren't you?     
 [softly] Now, you listen to me, 'kay?     
 I will not let you grow up in this place.     
 I won't do it.     
 Do you hear me?     
 They...     
 They do not own you.     
 And they do not own what you will become.     
 Do you hear me?     
 I'm gonna get you out of here.     
 I'm gonna get us out of here.     
 I promise you.     
 I promise.
