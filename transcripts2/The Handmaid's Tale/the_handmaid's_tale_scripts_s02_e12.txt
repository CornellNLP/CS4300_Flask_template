  Roy? 
  Call the ambulance! 
  - You're having a baby. 
  - Yeah. 
  I can promise you that this pregnancy will end soon and Offred will be off to her next posting. 
  In a new district. 
  I have sinned against you and God and I beg for mercy. 
  Don't worry about it. 
  I'm your wife! 
  You just caught me cheating on you! 
  You should care! 
  To have a pregnant Handmaid run away once is bad enough! 
  But twice! 
  They'll put us on the Wall! 
  Yeah? 
  Maybe they'll hang us side by side. 
  Just my f*cking luck. 
  I gave up everything for you. 
  And I only ever wanted one thing in return. 
  I wanted a baby. 
  We did it, Holly. 
  God bless you, my angel. 
  My sweet Nichole. 
  Aah! 
  Blessed day. 
  My dear girl. 
  Are we about done? 
  I think so. 
  So precious. 
  Every drop. 
  I'll take that. 
  How is everything down there? 
  - Have we healed? 
  - Mm-hm. 
  You see what a few weeks of rest can do? 
  I know this is difficult for you. 
  But you have done something extraordinary. 
  Out for a drive, to go into labor, then deliver in an empty house. 
  I can't bear to think what might have happened if those neighbors hadn't found you. 
  Aunt Lydia. 
  It's even less than yesterday. 
  I know. 
  But we are bound by Mrs. 
  Waterford's wishes. 
  Why? 
  You promised me you would take care of this baby. 
  Yes. 
  Well One can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
  We must look to the future, and you are a popular girl. 
  Several households have already made overtures. 
  Commander and Mrs. 
  Webber sent me these baked goods. 
  Bit of bribery. 
  Take one, dear. 
  You've earned it. 
  Barely an ounce from the right, 1. 
  2 from the left. 
  I think I've earned a whole cake. 
  Prideful girls don't get anything. 
  Thank you. 
  We'll be back for more in three hours. 
  Bran. 
  Great. 
  Praise f*cking be. 
  I told the committee, I don't need so much space, but they insisted. 
  For the optics. 
  Well, you're running point on media expansion now. 
  You'll need to spread out. 
  Here's the real hero. 
  There was a misunderstanding with some overzealous Guardians, but Nick protected our child. 
  We'll let you get settled. 
  Praise be. 
  Praise be. 
  Under His eye. 
  You handled the situation at that house with discretion. 
  Thank you for taking care of it, sir. 
  We always look out for each other. 
  Don't we? 
  Yes, sir. 
  The future's full of possibilities. 
  For both of us. 
  Things are going to happen for you. 
  I appreciate that. 
  There's a hook for that, just there. 
  Down on the right. 
  Little more. 
  Perfect. 
  Inspiring, isn't it? 
  Praise be. 
  Now I can finally use them all, thanks to God. 
  Such beautiful things. 
  Patience and service and sacrifice. 
  In the end, it's all worth it. 
  You're very good with her. 
  I helped my mother a lot with my little sister. 
  A sister. 
  Your parents have been so blessed. 
  Is somebody hungry? 
  It's not too hot, is it? 
  No. 
  No, ma'am. 
  Here we go. 
  There you are. 
  Ma'am? 
  Our supply is running low. 
  It's just sometimes the milk dries up. 
  - If the baby's not - Yes, I understand. 
  We can't have that now, can we? 
  Where am I going? 
  Just follow me. 
  Blessed day. 
  Blessed day. 
  Inside, please. 
  Well, hello there. 
  Under His eye. 
  Wait. 
  No. 
  No. 
  No. 
  No. 
  Offred. 
  You're not as productive as we would like. 
  Seeing her might prime the pump, so to speak. 
  Nichole This is Offred. 
  Nichole. 
  A beautiful name for a beautiful child. 
  She looks just like her father. 
  Ah! 
  This is God's way, dear. 
  Yes. 
  Well. 
  That did the trick. 
  Wait! 
  Let me nurse her. 
  That would be very helpful. 
  Just send what we need to the house. 
  Commander Waterford, if you keep the infant separate from the source, we're going to have to repeat this whole process. 
  I appreciate your insight. 
  Ah. 
  I'm aware of your concerns. 
  But might it be more efficient if Offred were to pump for the baby at home? 
  You'd like to be of service, wouldn't you, Offred? 
  May I be worthy? 
  Consider what's best for your daughter. 
  Did you let her touch my child? 
  I asked you a question. 
  Did you let her touch my child? 
  I promised I wouldn't. 
  So, instead, you brought her straight home! 
  Oh, be sensible. 
  It's more convenient to have Offred here. 
  - For you? 
  - For Nichole! 
  Our child needs a calm and healthy environment and you are making that very difficult! 
  Well, it doesn't have to be. 
  Let's see how it goes. 
  She has no contact with the baby, and she pumps in her room. 
  Mother knows best. 
  You're lucky they agreed. 
  Four couples have refused. 
  You're running out of chances. 
  You must behave. 
  Commander Lawrence is a very brilliant, very important man. 
  He is considered the architect of Gilead's economy. 
  Have you nothing to say for yourself? 
  I'm wondering why such an important, brilliant man would take in such a shitty Handmaid. 
  - Come on then. 
  - Thank you. 
  Wait here. 
  sh1t! 
  Goddammit! 
  Bl-blessed be the fruit. 
  May the Lord open. 
  Praise be to you, and may God make me worthy. 
  Super. 
  Shall we wait for Mrs. 
  Lawrence? 
  She won't be coming down. 
  She's not feeling well. 
  We're good here. 
  Blessed be the fruit. 
  Glory be. 
  Don't touch my stuff! 
  It's in my way! 
  - You want a beating? 
  - Try it, old man. 
  This is my house, I want it where I want it. 
  What are you looking at? 
  I'm sorry, Commander Lawrence. 
  You know the penalty for reading nowadays? 
  Feel free to answer anytime. 
  A finger for a first offense. 
  You think that's fair? 
  It's the law. 
  It used to be a hand. 
  Back in the "good old days. 
  " This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine Under His eye. 
  Under His eye. 
  Does it hurt? 
  To pump. 
  No, it just feels, uh, odd. 
  I can't wait to feel it. 
  To breastfeed, I mean. 
  I hope you do someday. 
  May God find me worthy. 
  Right. 
  He'd want a child to be raised by parents who really love each other. 
  Don't you think? 
  God? 
  What if you had that chance? 
  For love and a baby? 
  Eden. 
  You don't have to, to worry about me. 
  I won't be around long. 
  I think in this place you grab love wherever you can find it. 
  Blessed night. 
  And sweet dreams. 
  Sweet dreams. 
  Sugar. 
  Flour. 
  Oh, and get extra potatoes. 
  Starchy food is good for nursing mothers. 
  Sorry. 
  It's all right. 
  Have you seen Eden around? 
  I don't have enough to do? 
  I have to keep tabs on your wife now? 
  Oh, and get cinnamon and don't let them say no. 
  We have a baby now. 
  It's one of the perks. 
  I haven't seen her today. 
  She was gone when I woke up this morning. 
  Maybe she went to the mall. 
  I heard there was a sale at Old Navy. 
  Our baby's so beautiful. 
  I wish I could hold her. 
  Me too. 
  We should just run away somewhere. 
  Start over. 
  Like a real family. 
  Where would we go? 
  Out West. 
  The coast. 
  Still Gilead. 
  Hawaii, then. 
  Maui. 
  She's gonna love the beach. 
  Yeah. 
  She can play in the sun. 
  She's gonna try to eat the sand. 
  - She is? 
  - Yeah. 
  All kids do it. 
  She won't. 
  She's too smart. 
  Like her mom. 
  Holly. 
  That's what I want to name her. 
  After my mom. 
  I mean, if that's okay. 
  Holly. 
  That sounds right. 
  Yeah? 
  Nick? 
  Sir? 
  Guardian Isaac. 
  He's not at his post. 
  I'll take care of it. 
  He never showed up for his shift this morning. 
  What is it? 
  Sir, I think, uh I think we may have a situation. 
  Do you know what this looks like for me? 
  Fred. 
  Please. 
  I gave her the opportunity to elevate herself. 
  To be a wife, a mother. 
  To be associated with the Waterford name. 
  Fred, we can't be sure that she ran off with him. 
  Eden is a good, pious girl A married woman swept up in her own selfish lust! 
  That is enough! 
  I will not have this kind of rancor around my child. 
  You go do what you need to do to find that girl but you leave me out of it. 
  Shh. 
  Shh. 
  So fussy today. 
  - Does she want a bottle? 
  - No, she just had one. 
  Shh. 
  Sh, sh, sh, sh. 
  - Do you want me to take her? 
  - No, thank you. 
  Shh. 
  Sh. 
  Sh, sh, sh. 
  Momma's here. 
  Shh, sh. 
  Shh. 
  Sh. 
  Sh. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Sh. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You don't have to do that. 
  You've got your hands full. 
  She changes Nichole's outfits every 10 minutes. 
  Never thought I'd miss Eden so much. 
  - Rita? 
  - Ugh. 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  Coming. 
  You working late? 
  Wasted time dealing with that slut. 
  Nick's wife. 
  She won't get far. 
 
 
 
  I hope she's alright. 
  We'll find her. 
  Bring her home. 
  Why would a girl risk so much to leave? 
  I don't know. 
  Don't you? 
  Where were you hiding when we searched in that house? 
  The attic. 
  So, you heard us? 
  Honestly My heart was beating so fast, I couldn't hear much of anything. 
  You were that frightened. 
  Yeah. 
  Yet you preferred to hide in the attic to avoid coming home. 
  With me. 
  I had just said goodbye to my daughter. 
  And you know what? 
  I wanted to spend some more time with my baby, before she was born. 
  So, how was your reunion? 
  With Hannah? 
  Yes. 
  I was surprised to see her. 
  It's what you wanted, isn't it? 
  It's what you asked for. 
  I'm glad I made it happen. 
  For you. 
  Thank you. 
  Is that all the thanks I get? 
  We could play Scrabble sometime. 
  - Scrabble. 
  - Yeah. 
  It's been awhile. 
  And I think it would be fun. 
  Don't you? 
  We'll see. 
  Have a good night. 
  Hello. 
  Who are you? 
  Ofjoseph. 
  Your real name. 
  Emily. 
  Emily. 
  You have such beautiful eyes. 
  Don't tell Joseph that I came in. 
  He doesn't like it when I talk to the girls. 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  He did something terrible. 
  Terrible! 
  He came up with the whole thing. 
  With what? 
  The colonies. 
  He planned everything. 
  He figured it all out. 
  And I said, real people are digging up that dirt, and it's poison. 
  It's poison. 
  - It's poison. 
  - Eleanor, please, please. 
  - Oh, you're a monster! 
  - Okay! 
  Okay! 
  Come on! 
  Come on! 
  You're disgusting! 
  I hate you! 
  Okay. 
  Okay, sweetheart. 
  You're gonna get back in your bed. 
  And you're gonna rest. 
  And I'm gonna come back and check on you. 
  You know what you did! 
  You know what you did! 
  Come. 
  Sit. 
  We value privacy in this house. 
  Do you understand? 
  Yes, sir. 
  Is she okay? 
  Life didn't turn out the way she wanted it to. 
  She was an art professor. 
  She wanted everything to be beautiful. 
  Where are you from? 
  - Here. 
  - No, you're not. 
  You're from Montana. 
  What did you teach? 
  Cellular biology. 
  I don't remember any science professors who looked like you. 
  Those college boys must have been hot for teacher. 
  Or college girls, in your case. 
  Do you miss the classroom? 
  God has called me to a higher purpose. 
  You don't believe that. 
  You had an affair with a Martha. 
  You stole a car. 
  You ran over a Guardian. 
  How'd that feel? 
  You have a A wife and a son? 
  Yes, sir. 
  You must miss them. 
  Losing a child is like losing a limb a part of your body. 
  But you know what that's like too, right? 
  Do you know, have you healed properly? 
  - Offred. 
  - I haven't pumped yet. 
  They They found her. 
  Is she okay? 
  They brought her back. 
  With Isaac. 
  Tell them you might be pregnant, They tested me. 
  I'm not. 
  Well, they already have Isaac for desertion. 
  Say that he took you with him by force. 
  Say he wouldn't let you come home. 
  - It's not true. 
  - The truth doesn't matter right now, Eden! 
  It matters to God! 
  he knows what's inside my heart! 
  He doesn't decide what happens here today, okay? 
  Just Tell them what they need to hear. 
  Say you sinned, you're sorry. 
  I can't. 
  Yes, you can. 
  All we wanted was to make a real family. 
  Isn't that what Gilead wants of God's servants? 
  We can do that. 
  We can make a family. 
  We can make a baby, whatever I need to do to fix this, I'll do it. 
  I love Isaac. 
  And he loves me, and we want to be together. 
  I don't want to have your baby. 
  I'm really sorry. 
  You don't have to be sorry for that. 
  I need you to forgive me. 
  Forgive you? 
  I I'm the one who should be asking you to forgive me. 
  For all the times that I should have been kinder. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Let's forgive each other, then. 
  You have your whole life ahead of you. 
  - The Lord said - Eden, please. 
  When thou passest through the waters, - I shall be with thee. 
  - Stop. 
  And through the river, - they shall not overflow thee. 
  - Stop. 
  When thou walkest through the fire, - thou shalt not be burned - Oh, stop. 
  Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. 
  The accused have been found guilty of infidelity in violation of Exodus chapter 20, verse 14. 
  By the laws of God and His servants here on Earth, they have been sentenced to the Common Mercy of the State. 
  Shh. 
  Shh. 
  Sh. 
  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us, and cleanse us all from unrighteousness. 
  Renounce your sins and plead for His mercy. 
  Children of God! 
  Renounce your sins and plead for His mercy! 
  Eden! 
  Children of God! 
  Renounce your sins and plead for His mercy! 
  Love is patient. 
  Love is kind. 
  It does not envy. 
  It does not boast. 
  It is does not dishonor others. 
  - It is not self-seeking - By His hand. 
  Are you all right? 
  Thus says the Lord: even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible be delivered. 
  For I will contend with he who contends with you, and I will save your children. 
  Shh. 
  Sh. 
  Shh. 
  Oh, no. 
  Sh, sh, sh. 
  I'll get you a bottle. 
  No, wait. 
  Wait. 
  Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.
