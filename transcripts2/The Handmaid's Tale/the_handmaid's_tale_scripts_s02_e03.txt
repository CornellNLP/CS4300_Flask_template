 [Offred]  Previously on  The Handmaid's Tale...   
 [driver]  Place has been empty   since before the war.   
 Maybe see you in a few days, if you're still around?   
 - [helicopter blades whirring] 
- [sirens wailing in distance]   
 - What is wrong with you? Moira. 
- No. Hey. It's Ruby now.   
 [Nick] June?   
 - You're okay. 
- You know what this is?   
 Do you know what happened here?   
 It's a slaughterhouse. Let's get out of here.   
 [Nick]  June, you can't leave. 
They're looking for you everywhere.   
 I don't care. I don't care.    
 [Nick] You're not a Martha making a run for the border.    
 You're a pregnant Handmaid.    
 We're gonna get Hannah. 
We're gonna go north!    
 No.    
 No, we're not.    
 Welcome to Ontario. Do you have any family in Canada?    
 - Hey. 
- [shakily] How are you here?    
 You're on my list, of course.    
 - Luke! [cries] 
- Hey.    
 God, by whose mercy the faithful departed, please send Your Holy Angel to watch over this place. Amen.

 [Luke] They're doing more military exercises along the border.    
 Canadian and British army.    
 [Moira] It's  :  .    
 Yeah, I... I got a late shift.    
 Oh, good. Time for eggs. You are too skinny.    
 Morning.    
 There is coffee.    
 There's eggs too, if you want 'em.    
 [Luke] How's it going?    
 Don't stay in bed all day.    
 Yeah. Yeah.    
 They have to be getting ready for an invasion.    
 Down through upstate New York.    
 It's      all over again.    
 Get yourself a plate. It's almost done.    
 Thanks, Mom.    
 [chuckles] f*ck you.    
 Whoa. My mom used to say the same thing.    
 - Smart lady. 
- That's crazy.    
 [Christy on recording]  So, tell me, what made you start this chapter   
 of  The Sons of Jacob?    
 [Lars on recording]  Well, I read about it online, you know,   
 there was a Facebook group.   
 And I guess I really got into it because of the kids.   
 The kids in this community, they didn't all have good homes,   
 so I wanted to help them, get them out of gangs   
 and away from their sinful families and into a better way of...   
 [June]  I'm grasping at straws, I know.   
 But straws can be useful.   
 One of the little pigs built a whole house of them.   
 You were there. All the time.   
 But no one noticed you.   
 All right.   
 Not no one.   
 [cheering indistinctly]     
 She said we were going to feed the ducks.   
 [chanting indistinctly]     
 [women] Take back the night! Claim our bodies, claim our rights!     
 Take a stand, take back the night!     
 Claim our bodies, claim our rights!     
 Take a stand, take back the night!     
 [women shouting, cheering indistinctly]     
 [inaudible]     
 [June]  I knew, I guess,   or I should have known.   
 Who feeds ducks at night?   
 It didn't matter.   
 I loved seeing my mother like that.   
 Later, my Mom told me they were writing down the name of their rapist.   
 And I remember thinking, there were so many pieces of paper.   
 So many,   
 it was like snow.   
 [helicopter whirring]     
 Hi.     
 Don't make yourself crazy with all this stuff.     
 [June] It is way too late.     
 Mmm, thank you.     
 You gotta stop stealing Rita's real coffee though.     
 She's gonna kill you. No joke.     
 You didn't wake me up.     
 Well, 'cause if I wake you, then you leave.     
 So how is that a win for me?     
 I should probably get going.     
 Listen, they've made contact.     
 I don't know for sure, but you should probably get ready to go.     
 Go where?     
 I don't know.     
 I'll see what I can find out, and try and come back on Tuesday for a couple of hours.     
 Hannah?     
 I'm trying.     
 f*ck.     
 I can't leave.     
 Getting you out safe is the best thing for everyone.     
 It's best for me.     
 For Hannah.     
 For everyone.     
 Better never means better for everyone.     
 Hey.     
 [sighs]     
 [phone ringing]     
 It's a lot, I know.     
 I was a zombie when I got here, and it was just like,     
 "Welcome to Canada. Here's your maple syrup."     
 They don't really give you maple syrup.     
 You okay?     
 [shuddering]     
 I was in the army.     
 Logistics and rapid deployment.     
 After everything, they just turned us all into Guardians.     
 A week later, my unit is hanging bodies on the wall.     
 Gender traitors.     
 One of them was a guy I dated in college.     
 There are trauma counselors here now.     
 Third floor. Right out of the elevator.     
 It gets easier,     
 I promise.     
 [sighs]     
 [garage door opening]     
 [truck engine running]     
 - [June] Where are the bags? 
- [driver scoffs]     
 No deliveries this week.     
 Or, I guess, no deliveries to you.     
 Only deliveries of.     
 [chuckles]     
 Now?     
 That's what they told me.     
 Is Nick coming?     
 [driver] Who's Nick?     
 I left some stuff upstairs, so...     
 I'll get rid of it. 
Come on. Get in the back.     
 [door closing]     
 [dramatic music playing]     
 [woman]  Baby June!   
 What happened?     
 We were escorting at the clinic in Springfield.     
 Your mom was working there today.     
 - Jeez. 
- [Sarah] f*cking Nazi prick assholes.     
 - [Carol] Yeah. 
- Hey, kiddo.     
 Hi. sh1t! Mom!     
 Ah, it's fine. Somebody threw a bottle.     
 - [woman] Doctors are targets. 
- [Holly] It happens all the time.     
 [Carol] Pricks usually don't have such good aim.     
 [laughter]     
 You need your thing, right?     
 Yeah. My immersion blender.     
 Right. It's... It's in there somewhere.     
 - Okay. 
- [Tricia] So, uh, what's cooking?     
 Oh, Luke and I are gonna make dinner for Moira.     
 He got this new Mark Bittman book, so he's feeling ambitious.     
 - [laughing] 
- What's with the duds?     
 Oh, these? I just came from work, so...     
 - [Tricia] They're nice. 
- Hmm.     
 - I work at a book publisher. 
- [Tricia] Cool.     
 Just small, academic.     
 I actually just got promoted to, um, assistant editor, so...     
 Moira's designing the website for a queer women's collective.     
 - [women exclaim indistinctly] 
- Well, that's great.     
 We need more of those.     
 [driver] You wait in here.     
 Someone will be along soon.     
 You go in grace, kid.     
 [truck engine starts]     
 [rain pattering]     
 [Omar] You a good witch or a bad witch?     
 Depends on who you ask, I guess.     
 What's your name?     
 June Osborn.     
 Your mother's maiden name?     
 Maddox.     
 Come on.     
 Where are we going?     
 Airstrip west of Worcester.     
 A guy has a puddle-jumper, takes black market stuff back and forth.     
 Back and forth where?     
 Canada.     
 The plane comes tomorrow as soon as it's dark.     
 I'll drop you at a... at a friendly house.     
 They'll walk you to the airstrip.     
 Quarter-mile maybe.     
 Who's they?     
 No idea.     
 Someone brave or stupid. Or both.     
 There's a lot of both.     
 Come on.     
 [door opens]     
 [cell phone buzzes]     
 [Omar] sh1t.     
 - sh1t. 
- What?     
 - sh1t. 
- What?     
 I'm sorry. We, uh...     
 I'm so sorry.     
 Hey!     
 - The safehouse... No, no, no, no! 
- Hey!     
 You gotta get back inside.     
 - No! 
- Yeah. Uh...     
 The safe house isn't safe. Just wait.     
 [June] You can't...     
 - I'm sorry. I can't. 
- [June] No! You can't... Hey!     
 [Omar] Get back!     
 - [June] No! Hey! You can't leave me here! 
- [Omar] Hey! No! No!     
 - [June] No! 
- [Omar] No, no, no, no!     
 Hey!     
 - [engine starts] 
- [June] No! No!     
 Hey!     
 - Hey! 
- [banging]     
 Hey! No!     
 No!     
 [softly] No.     
 Please.     
 Please.     
 Please.     
 [Omar] Come on.     
 Hurry up.     
 sh1t!     
 [panting]     
 f*ck!     
 [June] Thank you.     
 Thank you.     
 Get down.     
 sh1t.     
 [bell dinging]     
 [Omar whispering] Let's go.     
 Come on.     
 [door opens]     
 [man  ] Oh, pardon me.     
 [man  ] Uh-huh. No troubles. Thank you.     
 [man  ] The Lord is good.     
 [door closes]     
 Don't...     
 Don't say anything.     
 [June]  So this is where   the Econopeople live.   
 It's where I'd live if I weren't an adulteress.   
 If I'd gone to the right kind of church.   
 If I'd played my cards right.   
 If I'd known I was supposed to be playing cards.   
 - [Omar] Oh, hey, big guy. 
- [Adam] Hi.     
 [Omar] What are you doing still up?     
 Is Mommy home?     
 - [Adam] Yeah. 
- [Omar] Huh?     
 - [Adam] Yeah. 
- [Omar] Yes, she is.     
 [Omar laughs]     
 [chuckles]     
 [door opens]     
 Under His eye.     
 No.     
 Why don't you wait in the kitchen?     
 Don't touch anything!     
 Yes, ma'am.     
 [indistinct whispering]     
 How could you?     
 [Heather] What were you thinking?     
 [Adam] Blessed day.     
 [Heather and Omar arguing indistinctly]     
 Blessed day.     
 Do you know how to play firetrucks?     
 Yeah. Of course.     
 [Heather and Omar arguing indistinctly]     
 [June] All right.     
 Here. Goes through these two holes.     
 - [bell tinkling] 
- [June] Okay. Oh, you got it.     
 [Adam] Ding ding.     
 What does the bell do?     
 It, um...     
 [whispers] It warns people, so they can come and help.     
 Adam. Come get dressed.     
 Now.     
 Sorry. He wanted me to...     
 - [Heather] I'll take that. 
- [bell dinging]     
 Thank you.     
 Thank you for taking me in.     
 This wasn't my decision.     
 You're a Handmaid.     
 I was.     
 That's how they threaten us, if we're fruitful.     
 With the red dress and the wings.     
 I don't know how you could give your baby up to somebody else.     
 I'm trying not to.     
 I would die first.     
 Yeah, I used to think that, too.     
 - [helicopters whirring] 
- [indistinct chatter on radio]     
 [Adam] Well, where are my shoes?     
 [Heather] Did you look under the bed?     
 [Omar] Here it is.     
 - [chuckles] 
- Good.     
 Adam, found it. Okay.     
 [Heather] We want you to look your best for church.     
 [giggling]     
 You go to church.     
 We make a public profession of faith.     
 [Heather] All right, let's go.     
 Nothing bad about being early, nothing good about being late.     
 [Omar] We'll be back by  :  .     
 Try to be quiet.     
 Everyone here listens to everything.     
 Okay.     
 They really do.     
 Thank you for taking me in.     
 For everything.     
 So, are you brave or... stupid?     
 I'm not brave.     
 So, there you go. [chuckles]     
 [chuckles]     
 [bell tolling]     
 [Holly]  I never see you anymore.   
 Don't look at me. You're the one who's always traveling.     
 [Holly] It's important.     
 I know. [clears throat]     
 I had you when I was   , you know.     
 I do know.     
 It was not f*cking easy.     
 But you were wanted. You were...     
 You were very wanted.     
 Do you really like that job at that publishing place? Honestly.     
 Yeah. If I didn't, I'd find another job.     
 When you were little, you wanted to be on the Supreme Court.     
 [laughs]     
 Well, I also wanted to marry Jordan Catalano, so...     
 You really want to spend all day reading other people's words looking for typos?     
 Yup.     
 I sacrificed for you and it pisses me off that you're just settling.     
 Well, sorry.     
 I guess I'm not your justification for existence.     
 - [June sighs] 
- [Holly] How's Luke?     
 
 
 
 [June] He's good.     
 He's been working overtime to try to get some more time off around the wedding.     
 I don't think you should marry him.     
 [sighs]     
 What?     
 I've been thinking about it.     
 Mm. Great. I'm glad.     
 June, you are so young.     
 You really want to take all that energy and passion and give it to a man?     
 No, to Luke.     
 Luke is fine, but come on.     
 This country is going down the f*cking tubes.     
 It's time to get out in the street and fight, not just play house.     
 I'm not playing.     
 I think it's a mistake.     
 Okay.     
 [June clears throat]     
 [sighs]     
 [bell tolling]     
 [indistinct chatter over radio]     
 [helicopters whirring]     
 Hey. Come on.     
 [indistinct chatter over radio]     
 [knocking on door]     
 [man] Blessed day! Have you folks left already?     
 [panting]     
 Hello?     
 [knocking on door]     
 Omar?     
 Heather?     
 Hello?

 [footsteps receding]     
 [sighs]     
 [birds chirping]     
 - [bell tolling] 
- [feet tapping on floor]     
 [Hannah]  Hi. My name is Hannah. Say hi, Mr. Rabbit. Hi.   
 [June]  It's almost  :  .   
 Maybe they ran into friends.   
 Maybe Adam twisted his ankle,   
 and they had to go to the doctor.   
 Maybe a lot of things.   
 [clicking]     
 [aunt Lydia] The Earth is a gift, given to us by a loving and benevolent God.     
 But for so long, we took his blessings for granted.     
 We polluted our water supply, our air, even our bodies.     
 We poisoned everything precious to us, and then we were shocked when our world started dying.     
 But through our labors,     
 [clicking]     
 through the work of the Penitent, we can heal.     
 Stone by stone, we will earn back the favor of Our Lord.     
 [June breathing heavily]     
 We will build an Earth where seeds plant not among thorns, not in a barren and poisonous place, but onto sweet-smelling soil.     
 And He will surely bless us with abundances.     
 [sniffling]     
 [Moira] How do you think they got her?     
 The clinics destroyed all the abortion records.     
 [June] I don't know.     
 [Moira] I'm so sorry.     
 [sighs]     
 I told her it wasn't safe, what she was doing.     
 You were right.     
 So was she.     
 She knew.     
 Moira, she always knew.     
 Well, at least it'll go fast in the Colonies.     
 Not for her.     
 You know she'll fight like hell.     
 [sniffling]     
 [marbles clacking]     
 [June]  I waited before.   
 I thought things might be okay.   
 I swore I'd never do that again.

 [lively chatter]     
 [indistinct radio chatter]     
 [indistinct radio chatter]     
 [train horn blaring]     
 [indistinct radio chatter]     
 Blessed day.     
 Blessed day.     
 [Econowife] At least it's not raining.     
 All glory to God.

 [sniffling]     
 [June]  She's too young.   
 It's too late.   
 [Hannah and June] No! No!     
 [June]  We come apart.   
 My arms are held,   
 and the edges go dark   
 and nothing is left but a little window.   
 A very little window.   
 Like the wrong end of a telescope.   
 She left me once.   
 Now I have to leave her.   
 [dramatic music playing]

 Yeah.

 If you change your mind, you let me know.     
 I'm Caitlyn, by the way.     
 I'm Ruby.     
 You go f*ck yourself.     
 Blessed be the Froot Loops.     
 [laughing]     
 [Moira laughing]     
 How long you been holding onto that one?     
 A while.     
 [laughs]     
 [chuckles]     
 [plane approaching]     
 [pilot] You should hold on right there.     
 [June] I'm the Handmaid.     
 [Pilot] Where's the outfit?     
 How do I know you're the real deal?     
 Good enough.     
 Who are you?     
 I drive Commander Wells.     
 I did. I'm a driver.

 [June]  No mother is ever, completely,   
 a child's idea of what a mother should be,   
 and I suppose it works the other way around as well.   
 But,   
 despite everything,   
 we didn't do badly by one another.   
 We did as well as most.   
 I wish my mother were here,   
 so I could tell her I finally know this.   
 So I could tell her I forgive her.   
 And then ask Hannah to forgive me.
