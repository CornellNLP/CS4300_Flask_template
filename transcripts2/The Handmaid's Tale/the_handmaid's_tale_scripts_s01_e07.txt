 OFFRED:  Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 SERENA JOY:  We have some important guests tonight   
 Deputy Ambassador, Castillo,  puedo presentar  our Handmaid, Offred.   
 It is a pleasure to meet you.   
 Offred, what is your given name? From before.   
 I don't use that anymore.   
 Tonight is a celebration of what we have achieved.   
 The children of Gilead.   
 All brought forth in this district by our Handmaids.    
 OFFRED:  You don't understand. 
We're prisoners.   
 They took my daughter. 
Please do something.    
 FLORES: Offred? I want to help you.    
 I think, I can get a message to your husband.    
 My husband's dead.    
 FLORES: Lucas Bankole.    
 He's alive. Please, write something.    
 I'll try to get it to him.

 HANNAH: Ahhh! (GROANS)

 Are you okay? Is she all right?    
 Come on. Come on, baby.    
 Come here.    
 Come here, come here, honey. Let Mommy check you.    
 Come here. Come over here.    
 Is it your head? Did the car go bump?    
 It's okay.    
 All right. You've gotta take her. Okay?    
 - Go. It's about two miles north. 
- No, no, no.    
 He said someone's gonna meet us.    
 - All right, go with Mommy. 
- What about you?    
 - What about you? 
- No. No, no, it's all right. You go. Go!    
 - Run, run, run! Run, run! 
- (SIRENS APPROACHING)    
 Run.    
 Watch your step. 
Careful. Watch the rock!    
 Come on, go quickly.    
 Pop. Six. Pull.    
 (SIRENS APPROACHING)

 (SPITS)     
 (GROANING)     
 Okay.     
 Okay.     
 (CARS HONKING)     
 We're just out for breakfast.     
 That's not illegal.     
 Not yet.     
 She all right? We didn't give her too much?     
 No. She's okay.     
 She's okay.     
 We should have left when Moira did.     
 We had to wait for the visas.     
 When I lost my job, we should've left then.     
 Yeah, well, I can't just make the visa process move faster just because I want it to,     
 - all right? 
- I know. That's not what I'm saying.     
 Moira is crossing the border on foot.     
 - I know. 
- We've got a kid.     
 - I know that. 
- There's a difference.     
 I'm just saying we should've left when she did.     
 I know.     
 LUKE: Is that him?     
 Whitford, right?     
 Guess, uh, we should've set a password or something.     
 - You look like your mama, little June. 
- (CHUCKLES)     
 I'd know you anywhere.     
 Thank you for doing this, Mr. Whitford.     
 Oh, I owe her.     
 Your mama gave me the snip a few years back after they made it illegal.     
 It's no time for kids, you know?     
 - She zonked on something? 
- Benadryl.     
 I gave it to her with breakfast.     
 WHITFORD: Okay.     
 Well, we've got about an hour or so.     
 I need your phones.     
 Yeah, we turned 'em off.     
 Good.     
 Are you kidding me?     
 They can track these things location services or not.     
 That backpack needs to get going too.     
 Oh, no. That's all we brought with us.     
 Sorry.     
 It can't look like you're running.     
 Uh, yeah, you know, people carry backpacks on the street all the time, so, like, it doesn't necessarily say that we're leaving.     
 You wanna take that chance?     
 Here you go.     
 Wait. Hold on. Hold on.     
 I'm... I'm taking 'em.     
 So...     
 Okay.     
 I'll be driving.     
 All right.     
 You two and the rug rat will be in the trunk.     
 LUKE: Huh? No, no.     
 - I can't put the kid... In the trunk. 
- In the trunk?     
 Well, then forget this.     
 'Cause you'll never make it out of the county.     
 Okay.     
 Luke.     
 You all right?     
 LUKE: I got it. Come on.     
 JUNE: Yeah, she's fine.     
 Thank you. Come on.     
 Got her?     
 All right.     
 That a girl.     
 There you go.     
 And Fluffy.     
 Okay.     
 All right. All right.     
 Where's the Benadryl?     
 Oh, I don't know.     
 He threw it out.     
 Shoot.     
 LUKE: It's all right.     
 - What if she wakes up? 
- Nah, she won't wake up.     
 - You sure? 
- Yeah, she's all right.     
 She's all right.     
 (EXHALES)     
 (SIRENS APPROACHING)     
 - Hey. Hey. 
- Jesus.     
 It's okay.     
 - (SIRENS RECEDING) 
- Look at me.     
 - Luke. Luke. 
- June. June.     
 June bug? June bug?     
 June bug?     
 (LAUGHS)     
 Look at me.     
 It's gonna be all right.     
 Hey, hey, here. Just stay here.     
 We're gonna be all right.     
 I promise you, we're gonna be all right.     
 We're gonna be all right.     
 (GROANS)     
 You okay?     
 Yeah. I'm just really cozy.     
 Come on.     
 Do you remember     
 the sublet we had in Sommerville?     
 Mmm-hmm.     
 This is bigger.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 It is.     
 Yeah, this is much bigger.     
 It's a lot bigger.

 All good.     
 - Nothing in here. 
- Thank you.     
 (CAR DOOR CLOSES)     
 You good?     
 I took his sister to the prom back in the day.     
 Believe you, me, he owes me a f*ckin' favor.     
 Won't be much longer.     
 Welcome to your little slice of heaven.     
 As long as this slice of heaven has a shower.     
 - You got her? 
- Yeah. Yeah.     
 Hey come on, Hannah Banana. Come on.     
 Oh, look at you, you're tired.     
 Hey, how close are the neighbors?     
 Two miles. Six miles. Three miles.     
 Happy?     
 Hey, look.     
 Look at this.     
 It's snowing.     
 - Are you all right? 
- I'm hungry.     
 You're hungry?     
 Got food inside.     
 Mmm, you hear that?     
 - Make yourself at home. 
- Is there any heat?     
 Yeah, there's a wood burning stove in the corner, but it sucks.     
 I'd just use the fireplace, instead.     
 Hey, smile.     
 You're safe.     
 Hey, you want to pick out your bedroom? Yeah?     
 All right, let's go. Come on.     
 So, what now?     
 You stay here.     
 There's lots of patrols between here and the border.     
 It isn't safe for the ladies.     
 You ever shot a gun?     
 Hmm? Uh, Yeah. Uh, yeah. In college.     
 All right.     
 Revolvers are pretty straightforward.     
 Thumb hits the release latch. Cylinder pops out. Don't want it to spin.     
 Hit the ejector rod. Dump your brass.     
 Six bullets in.     
 Pull that hammer back. Fire.     
 - You got that? 
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it.     
 I'll make a run to Canada to get you some passports and I'll be back post haste.     
 Oh, no. We don't need passports. I got visas.     
 US passport doesn't mean sh1t anymore. Bud. That's over.     
 - So, we just wait? 
- Yup.     
 I'll be back.     
 And then we will get you all safe and sound to the magical land of the north.     
 (INDISTINCT TALKING)     
 Ah! No, don't, don't. No, please stop it! Please!     
 (GROANS)     
 Don't...     
 - Where are the others? 
- What?     
 - Your unit. Where? 
- No. it's not... I'm not a Guardian.     
 - I'm a... 
- Stay back.     
 LUKE: (GROANS) A medic. There's a... There's an ambulance crashed a few miles up the road.     
 The Guardian... The Guardian died. I just took his jacket     
 I just took his jacket.     
 Were you in the ambulance?     
 What happened?     
 They shot me.     
 And then they took my wife and they took my daughter.     
 I'm just trying to get back to them.     
 I took the jacket to stay warm.     
 I swear to God. I swear to God.     
 Let me look at that wound.     
 (SNIFFS)     
 (GROANS)     
 No, no, no.     
 ZOE: (CHUCKLES) You're going to bleed to death.     
 f*ck you.     
 - Oh, sh1t. 
- ZOE: It's not his jacket.     
 I topped off the tank and we got some ammo but there are patrols on the highway.     
 We should move on.     
 Okay. Help me with him.     
 Grab what you can. We gotta go.     
 PETER: You know at some point, you're gonna have to stop collecting strays.     
 (GROANS) I should've stopped before I found you.     
 You got him?     
 We got another one. Guardians shot him.     
 Clear a spot. We need to lay him down.     
 Don't worry, friend. We'll fix you up.     
 No, I can't go.     
 We've already been here too long. Come on.     
 (ENGINE STARTS)     
 More. Clean it up. Rinse it.     
 Dab it.     
 (GROANS)     
 Okay, okay, okay.     
 Lila, take the next town road south for about    clicks.     
 - That's miles. 
- Kilometers.     
 Gotta zig and zag on the way to the coast.     
 - (CLICKING) 
- (LUKE GROANING)     
 Oh, f*ck!     
 - (CLICKING CONTINUES) 
- Okay.     
 That should leave you with a nice big scar you can tell all your friends about.     
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)     
 Thank you.     
 - Zoe. 
- Zoe, I'm...     
 I'm Luke.     
 ZOE: Antibiotics.     
 That wound was full of crap.     
 Gotta stay on this drip until we reach Canada or you're gonna go septic.     
 Uh, no. I need... I need to get out...     
 There are Guardians all over.     
 We need to get some miles on them.     
 You need meds and rest. 
Then we can talk.     
 Arm out.     
 Make a fist.     
 Relax. All good.     
 Who are you guys?     
 You got an Army brat, two strays, a gay, and a nun.     
 Sorry about the f*cks.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 I think, God has bigger things on his plate these days.     
 Christine. Lila. Peter. Hey.     
 - What's her name? 
- TBD.     
 She hasn't said anything since we picked her up.     
 Here, try and get some rest.     
 (♪ "SWEET BABY JAMES" BY JAMES TAYLOR)     
 JUNE:  Hey do you want blueberries?   
 No, chocolate chips.     
 - For breakfast? 
- Daddy does it.     
 Does he? Okay.     
 - Come here. Wanna help me stir? 
- Yeah.     
 - JUNE: Do this part. Ready? 
- HANNAH: Yes.     
 - Whoops. All right. 
- That's good.     
 - Is that good? Are you sure? 
- Yeah.     
 - Yeah. 
- You sure you don't want more?     
 - Yeah, I want more. 
- (BOTH LAUGH)     
 I think that's fine. Ooh! 
Look at that method.     
 Very nice, I wonder who taught you that?     
 - (CHUCKLES) 
- HANNAH: Nobody taught me it. I just...     
 You just came up with it?     
 Hmm. Interesting.     
 (HANNAH WHISPERING)     
 (MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY)     
 - I'm watching you. 
- (JUNE LAUGHS)     
 (WHISPERS) That's all right. He's not looking.     
 The chips.     
 - LUKE: What's going on there? 
- Nothing.     
 Mind your own business.     
 Nothing's going on.     
 - Nothing. 
- Nothing.     
 It's nothing? Huh?     
 What are you doing? Open your mouth.     
 Let me see. Lemme see your tongue.     
 - We're out of syrup again. 
- LUKE: Huh?     
 We're out of syrup again.     
 That's 'cause you have pancakes every day.     
 I'm trying to set a record.     
 - It's going very well... 
- (CHUCKLES) What kind of...     
 - JUNE: Wanna do this part? 
- HANNAH: Yeah.     
 JUNE: Okay, come on.     
 Okay. I'll hold it right here.     
 - I wanna get it. 
- Okay. Okay. You do it.     
 I'm gonna... This is going to be my pancake.     
 All right, this is your pancake.     
 This is going to be pancake-y.     
 Whoa!     
 That is so chocolatey.     
 - This is going to be all mine. 
- (CHUCKLING)     
 (INDISTINCT TALKING)     
 (♪ "SWEET BABY JAMES" BY JAMES TAYLOR FADES OUT)     
 JUNE:  We have to talk to Daddy about that later.   
 (WOMAN GROANS)     
 ZOE: You're safe here.     
 (GROANING CONTINUES)     
 ZOE: It's okay. I'm here.     
 - PETER: What set her off? 
- CHRISTINE: I don't know.     
 (SCREAMS)     
 
 
 
 (CRYING)     
 What's going on?     
 (SIGHS) Um...     
 ZOE: It's okay. It's okay. I'm here.     
 Zoe was, uh, stationed at a base in South Carolina.     
 ZOE: It's okay.     
 Some of her group heard rumors about some, um, training centers.     
 LUKE: Training... Training for what?     
 PETER: After DC fell, they pulled together a bootleg raid.     
 Some high school in Rockdale.     
 They found her and, like,    other women hidden inside.     
 Their kids had been taken away.     
 CHRISTINE: Zoe, uh, got her out.     
 She was the only one.     
 Those guards at the school were not gonna let those women go.     
 CHRISTINE: We think, they were, um, looking for fertile women.     
 Gathering them up.     
 (JUNE LAUGHING)     
 When you're a pro, you're a pro. All right?     
 Daddy's showing off now.     
 So, the ice or bust, huh?     
 Here he goes.     
 - Ooh, ooh. Oh. 
- Oh. Come on.     
 Get it to the ice.     
 - Ice. Ice. Ice. 
- Ice? Ice?     
 Do you want to take the ice?     
 - Yes. 
- Come on.     
 Two in a row.     
 (DOG BARKING)     
 sh1t.     
 JOE: Blaze.     
 Hey, hey.     
 Sorry about that. He's friendly.     
 Come here. Hey. Sit.     
 I wasn't expecting to see anybody out here.     
 LUKE: Yeah, it's...     
 It's quiet out here, huh?     
 Hi there, I'm Joe.     
 Nice to meet you.     
 - It's pretty cold out, isn't it? 
- Mmm-hmm.     
 It is. We should probably get inside, huh?     
 Yeah. Look at you. You're all cold. We better get you in.     
 - You said, "sh1t." 
- I did say "sh1t." Yeah, I did.     
 JOE: I got you in some trouble, there.     
 Sorry about that.     
 Well, you folks stay warm.     
 Blaze, let's go. Let's go home. Come on, let's go.     
 You folks have a good day.     
 Thank you.     
 We've gotta go.     
 Come on, honey. Come on. Careful.     
 (CLANGING)     
 Are we heading north?     
 That's where Canada is.     
 Oh. No, no. I've gotta... I've gotta get out.     
 I've gotta...     
 I've gotta head back to Boston.     
 - You were shot. 
- There are soldiers everywhere...     
 No. I just... Stop...     
 Stop the bus.     
 CHRISTINE: You'll get caught before you hit Massachusetts.     
 Stop the f*cking bus, now.     
 I'm getting out here.     
 - You're not getting out. 
- I'm getting out...     
 We're not stopping. Sit down.     
 (GUN CLICKS)     
 (GROANS)     
 God damn it.     
 We're going to the coast.     
 You can maybe grab a scoot boat down to Marblehead.     
 Thank you.     
 The car is warming up. Where is she?     
 In the bathroom. Just one last try.     
 What's that?     
 Whitford gave me a gun. 
It's just in case. Okay?     
 Jesus. Do you know how to use it?     
 Uh, yeah, a little. I know how to load it.     
 Look, we need to be ready, all right, June? It's just in case.     
 Then show me how to load it.     
 - All right. Take a bullet outta there.     
 All right.     
 This pops open here. (GUN CLICKING)     
 And then you put six in here.     
 You close it.     
 Pull the hammer back and then it fires. Careful.     
 - Okay. So just open it here... 
- Yeah.     
 - Close it... 
- Shh, shh, shh.     
 Stop. (GUN CLICKS)     
 Hold up.     
 I'm a friend.     
 Don't move. Don't move.     
 LUKE: Easy. Easy.     
 You guys are from Boston. 
I heard it on my scanner.     
 They're looking for you.     
 Yeah, well, we're leaving now anyway. So, thanks.     
 Well, they know your car. You gotta stay off the main road.     
 - Should we wait for Whitford here? 
- I don't know.     
 There's no sense in that. He's dead.     
 They caught him. They hung him up on a street lamp in town.     
 He's a strange guy. I liked him.     
 Look, could you put the gun down?     
 (WHISPERS) It's all right. It's all right.     
 Look, they're patrolling all over.     
 You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes.     
 I called a friend, so if you guys can make it past Jackman, he's gonna meet you at the border.     
 - Thank you. 
- Thank you.     
 JOE: No worries.     
 This is pretty f*cked up.     
 (TRUCK RUMBLING)     
 Come on.     
 May the Lord guide your steps and bring you to your June and your Hannah.     
 He has not forgotten any of you.     
 Thank you.     
 If you're ever in Boston, you'll look me up?     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 I got it.     
 - Oh, no, no, I got... 
- You sure?     
 You might be able to get a ride out of Cutler.     
 It's    miles south.     
 Good luck.     
 Thank you.     
 Boat leaves soon as it's dark.     
 (SNIFFS)     
 Our dock is a half mile down river, if you change your mind.     
 Let me show you something.     
 The town fought back.     
 They tried to hide the fertile women in here.     
 (DOOR CLOSES)     
 (COUGHS)     
 The Guardians took them and strung everyone else up.     
 (GAGGING)     
 There's one of these in every town.     
 This is what they do to people who fight back.     
 It's the only thing I can do.     
 The US government has people in Canada.     
 They can help you find them, maybe even get them out.     
 No. No.     
 I'm not...     
 If you go back, you're gonna die.     
 You're gonna die and leave them all on their own.     
 Is that what you want?     
 I don't... I don't...     
 He's coming.     
 Smart.     
 I wasted a whole prayer on you.     
 One of my good ones.     
 PETER: Let's go.     
 We heard Gilead's starting to patrol with drones.     
 It's gonna be fast, just straight up the coast to New Brunswick.     
 It's okay. All aboard.     
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.     
 You paid for five, not six.     
 Who's not coming?     
 We're all coming. We're all coming.     
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.     
 That's not how this works.     
 (ZIP OPENS) All right.     
 This is morphine.     
 It's Percocet.     
 - All right? 
- It's a good start.     
 - What else you got in there? 
- Don't be a m*therf*cker.     
 - Hey! 
- It's all right. It's all right.     
 - This a free enterprise. 
- (ZIP OPENS)     
 That'll do.     
 Come on, let's go!     
 Let's move, let's move. Stow it all away.     
 It's all right. It's all right.     
 Grab that line.     
 Come on, I'm gonna help you down.     
 (GUNSHOTS)     
 - Go! 
- Come on. Let's get outta here!     
 - Come on! 
- (GUNSHOTS INTENSIFY)     
 Let's move.     
 - (SCREAMS) 
- Get down!     
 (GROANS)     
 (SCREAMS)     
 Stop!     
 (GUN FIRING)     
 Stay down!     
 Stay down. It's all right.     
 Sorry. (WOMAN CRYING)     
 Stay down.     
 Stay down.     
 It's all right.     
 It's all right.     
 (WHISTLES)     
 (WOMAN LAUGHS)     
 It's tea.     
 They'd run outta coffee.     
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.     
 I'm not in charge of rationing.     
 You're welcome.     
 It's nice out, right?     
 They got the power back on in the apartment.     
 Things... Hey, no, no, no.     
 That doesn't mean you get to go back to sitting inside all day.     
 Hey, seriously. No.     
 See?     
 This is nice, right?     
 (PHONE RINGS)     
 WOMAN: (ON PHONE)  Hello, Mr. Bankole?   
 Uh, yeah. Hello?     
 WOMAN:  We know your meeting with Ms. Tapping is next week.   
 But we were hoping you could come in today?   
 (BELL RINGS)     
 (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)     
 (SIGHS)     
 Luke Bankole?     
 Uh, yeah. Um...     
 Ms. Tapping?     
 Oh, Rachel, please.     
 Ava, could you get us some coffee?     
 Please, come in.     
 Yeah, so, um... I think that you're looking...     
 Thank you... Thank you so much for...     
 For seeing me. I really appreciate it.     
 So, I think, uh, you're probably looking for high schools.     
 See, if I was trying to hide a couple of hundred people, then I don't think that...     
 RACHEL: Luke.     
 (SNIFFS)     
 Do you know a woman named June Osborn?     
 She's   , blonde hair, blue eyes, from Boston?     
 Yes, my wife.     
 That's what we thought.     
 This is for you.     
 Where did you get this?     
 One of our contacts in the Mexican government.     
 From one of their trade delegates.     
 Sorry it's not more.     
 I think they only had a few seconds.     
 (♪ "NOTHING'S GONNA HURT YOU BABY" BY CIGARETTES AFTER s*x)     
 When?     
 Three weeks ago.     
 So, she's alive?     
 We believe so, yes.     
 (VOICE CRACKING) Sorry... Sorry. Can I have a moment?     
 I'm sorry.     
 Yes, of course.     
 (LAUGHS)     
 OFFRED:  I love you   
 so much.   
 Save Hannah.   
 (♪ "NOTHING'S GONNA HURT YOU BABY" BY CIGARETTES AFTER s*x CONTINUES)
