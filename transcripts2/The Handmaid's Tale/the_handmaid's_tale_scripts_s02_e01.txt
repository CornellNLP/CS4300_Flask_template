 Run, run, run! Run, run!   
 [Offred]  Previously   on  The Handmaid's Tale...   
 Please don't take her! 
Please don't take her!   
 - [Hannah] Mommy! 
- [June] No!   
 [screams]   
 [Aunt Lydia] You girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful   
 and their barren wives.   
 You will bear children for them.   
 The Commander. Maybe he can't.    
 I was thinking maybe we could try another way.    
 I couldn't say no when Mrs. Waterford asked me. I'm sorry.    
 f*ck!    
 [Ofsteven]  Mayday can't use me anymore.   
 - but you can help them. 
- Who are they?    
 [Ofsteven]  They're fighting back.   
 [tires screeching]    
 [Handmaids screaming]    
 [Gambel]  The accused stand   charged with gender treachery.   
 [Aunt Lydia]  I know this is   a shock for you, Emily.   
 - You can still have children, of course. 
- [screams]    
 [Commander Fred]  Tonight, I'm taking you out.   
 [Offred]  I thought these kinds   of places were forbidden.   
 I'm so sorry I left you at the train!    
 [sobbing] It's okay.    
 [Offred]  We're gonna find a way to get you out of here.   
 This is Gilead. No one gets out.    
 Do not let them grind you down.    
 You keep your f*cking sh1t together. 
You fight!   
 [shrieks]    
 Offred, I think I can get a message to your husband.    
 My husband's dead.    
 [man]  Lucas Bankole. He's alive.   
 They find us together, I'm gonna get sent to the Colonies.    
 You're an Eye. You're untouchable.    
 [Serena]  He's answered our prayers.   
 - [Nick]  Praised be. 
- [Serena]  It isn't yours.   
 You can't father a child, because you're not worthy.    
 [objects clattering]    
 Please, let me out! That's my daughter! Hannah!    
 As long as my baby is safe, so is yours.    
 No!    
 I want to help with Mayday.    
 They need you to go back to Jezebel's.    
 They've been trying to get a package out of there.   
 [Offred reading]  "I'm in Boston, I think. We are prisoners.   
 You have to tell people what's happening here. Please don't forget me.   
 Please don't forget us all."   
 Welcome to Ontario. Do you have any family in Canada?    
 Hey.    
 [crying]    
 - Let me have Angela. 
- Her name is Charlotte, you lying f*ck!    
 There is no greatest sin than harming a child.    
 The punishment for that crime is death by stoning.   
 Aunt Lydia, come on. We can't do this.    
 I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.    
 - [Handmaid] I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia. 
- I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.    
 [Handmaids continue apologizing]    
 [Aunt Lydia] Go home, all of you!    
 There will be consequences.    
 [whispers] Just go with them. Trust me.    
 [Serena]  Where are you taking her?   
 [Commander Fred]  What's going on?   
 [Offred]  Whether this is   my end or a new beginning,   
 I have no way of knowing.   
 And so I step up, 
into the darkness within...   
 Or else the light.

 Move! Move!

 [man] Come on! Let's go!

 [Aunt Lydia on PA] You will love the Lord, Thy God, with all your heart.     
 You shall walk with Him and fear Him, and cleave unto Him.     
 And you shall obey His word and the word of His servants here on Earth, or you shall feel the pain of His judgment.     
 For that is His love.     
 Let this be a lesson to you.     
 [Offred]  Our Father,   who art in heaven...   
 Seriously?   
 What the actual f*ck?   
 [June] Okay, other foot. Thank you.     
 [Hannah] You're welcome.     
 Hey, how you feelin', banana?     
 - Uh, I'm hungry. 
- Yeah? That's good.     
 We are awesome.     
 - Huh? 
- [June] Mmm-hmm.     
 All right, two more bites of yogurt, okay?     
 Mango? I want waffles.     
 Well, you're gonna have two more bites of yogurt, and I don't want any fairy bites, okay?     
 [Luke] Uh... Oh, hey, honey, are you going to Walgreens?     
 I was going to. I have to get Tylenol.     
 Oh, I need some, uh,     
 - deodorant and some batteries. 
- Okay.     
 Double As.     
 And I need you to sign the form for my refilling.     
 I'm on my last month, so...     
 What, they actually asked to see it?     
 Yup, there's a line for "Husband."     
 That's ridiculous.     
 I mean, I don't have to pick them up.     
 You know, at all.     
 You wanna go off?     
 I don't know.     
 I think, maybe?     
 Maybe?     
 - Let's go, Mom. 
- [June] Okay, pumpkin.     
 Okay, see you later.     
 - Uh, hey... 
- [June] Come on.     
 Honey...     
 Don't get 'em. Don't pick 'em up.     
 Okay.     
 [both laughing]     
 It's crazy.     
 - Yeah? 
- Mmm-hmm.     
 [chuckles]     
 I love you.     
 I love you.     
 [Luke] Mmm.     
 - [Hannah] Let's go, Mom. 
- [Luke] Not bad.     
 [laughs] Okay, I have to go.     
 - Really? 
- Yes.     
 - Close your eyes. 
- [laughs]     
 - Peeping Tom. 
- Yeah. We're leaving.     
 [both laugh]     
 - Bye. 
- [Hannah] Oh, my gosh.     
 [exhales]     
 [thunder rumbling]     
 [Aunt Lydia] Such spoiled girls you are.     
 Such spoiled brats.     
 He has given you everything, but when He asks you for your faith, you refuse.     
 - [electricity crackling] 
- [Handmaid groans]     
 You are told the will of God, and you say, "I know better."     
 Arm up, dear.     
 - [electricity crackling] 
- [groans]     
 You say, "I know better than God himself."     
 He loves you.     
 He protects you.     
 Don't you remember what it was like before?     
 [shuddering]     
 Now you are saved.     
 Girls, there is more than one kind of freedom.     
 There is freedom to and freedom from.     
 In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to.     
 Now, you are being given freedom from.     
 That is a gift from God.     
 Do not underrate it.     
 [speaking indistinctly]     
 - [exclaims] What? 
- Hmm.     
 Offred has been keeping a secret.     
 [laughs]     
 A most wonderful secret.     
 She has been filled with His divine light.     
 May we say, "Praise be His mercy"?     
 [Handmaids] Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 How do we greet a miracle?     
 Do we...     
 Do we whine like sick dogs?     
 [shouts] Praise be His mercy!     
 [Handmaids speaking louder] 
Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy.     
 Praise be His mercy indeed!     
 [door closes]     
 Get her out of these wet things.     
 Under His eye.     
 [breathing heavily]     
 [inhales sharply]     
 Oh! [crying]     
 - [bell tolling] 
- [laughing]     
 [sighs]     
 [sobbing]     
 [tolling continues]     
 [tolling echoes]     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 There's nothing like hot soup on a rainy day.     
 Such a comfort.     
 [Aunt Lydia sighs]     
 Dig in.     
 You're eating for two. [laughs]     
 I'm not hungry.     
 Loss of appetite is common these first few weeks.     
 You just have to make an effort.     
 You have quite an adventure ahead of you.     
 And we are going to make sure you get absolutely everything you need.     
 Plenty of rest and healthy food.     
 Fresh air, exercise.     
 You'll just have to be my very good girl.     
 You could do that, can't you?     
 - I'll try, Aunt Lydia. 
- Good.     
 We certainly won't have any more theatrics, will we?     
 [laughing]     
 Such nonsense.     
 Such a waste of energy. And for what?     
 For nothing.     
 Janine isn't nothing.     
 No, she most certainly is not.     
 Do you think you've done her a kindness?     
 She could have gone to God quickly, surrounded by her friends.     
 Friends don't stone their friends to death.     
 Janine is on her way to the Colonies.     
 She will suffer because of you.     
 Every Handmaid who followed you into disobedience will face the consequences, but not you.     
 You are with child. You are protected.     
 But you know that.     
 Such a brave girl, aren't you?     
 Standing in defiance, but risking nothing.     
 Now eat.     
 I'm not hungry.     
 A walk, then.     
 [chains clinking]     
 [Aunt Lydia] Pleasant evening, Ofwyatt.     
 Ofwyatt was having a hard time at home.     
 She was very defiant.     
 [Ofwyatt's Aunt] She drank drain cleaner which is terrible.     
 [Aunt Lydia] 
Ofwyatt endangered her child.     
 This we simply cannot abide.     
 Offred, if you choose to be difficult, I will be forced to make arrangements.     
 Nine months can feel like quite a long time.     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 May the Lord open.     
 [Aunt Lydia] Well, shall we get you something to eat, then?     
 Yes, Aunt Lydia.     
 Wonderful.     
 [thunder breaking]     
 [door opens]     
 [Aunt Lydia] Line up!     
 Three rows.     
 Hands behind your back.     
 Stand up straight.     
 - [electricity crackles] 
- [groans]     
 [Aunt Lydia] Eyes front.     
 Straight line.     
 Move up.     
 This is not a straight line.     
 [chuckles]     
 Ofrobert, you're first.     
 Please.     
 No!     
 [whimpering] No! No, no, no.     
 [Ofrobert] I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.     
 - I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia. Please... 
- [Aunt Lydia] You girls.     
 So willful and full of apologies when it comes time to pay the Piper.     
 No, no, no. No! No!     
 [Aunt Lydia] Ofrobert.     
 - Ofrobert. 
- [Ofrobert grunting]     
 [Aunt Lydia] I know, dear.     
 But it's as shameful for me as well.     
 [Handmaid sobbing]     
 But only in suffering will we find grace.     
 [Ofrobert] Please, please don't.     
 No. [whimpers]     
 - No. 
- [igniter clicking]     
 [screams]     
 - [screaming continues] 
- [Handmaids whimpering]     
 [screaming continues]     
 [thunder rumbling]     
 [car horns blaring]     
 [man] June.     
 - [June] Hey. 
- You've been buzzing.     
 Antorio, thanks.     
 Did you set the thing with, uh, his boss?     
 [Antorio] Uh, yeah, I'm waiting for a call back.     
 Hey, how's the draft?     
 It's good. Changes are helping.     
 [Antorio] Agricultural economics, in early modern Spain and Portugal.     
 That's, um... That's sexy.     
 - sh1t. 
- [Antorio] What?     
 It's my daughter's school.     
 [dialing]     
 [recording]  Hello, you've reached Madison Grand Elementary School.   
 - If you know the extension... 
- [keypad beeping]     
 [dialing]     
 [woman]  Madison Grand Elementary School.   
 Hi, this is June Osborne.     
 Um, you called me. My daughter is Hannah Bankole.     
 [woman]  Oh. Okay, Mrs. Bankole.   
 I'm afraid Hannah isn't feeling very well this morning.   
 Is she okay?     
 Can I speak to Mrs. Danjee?     
 [woman]  She was running a temperature.   
 Um,    . .   
 Crap! Okay.     
 She was a little warm when she woke up.   
 I gave her some Tylenol to break it down.     
 [woman]  A child is required   to be fever free for    hours   
 before she can return to school.   
 I'm sorry. I'm leaving now.     
 Um, can you tell Mrs. Danjee to tell Hannah I'll be there in, like,    minutes?     
 [woman]  Mrs. Bankole, Hannah isn't here.   
 When we couldn't reach you, we called an ambulance.   
 She has a fever.     
 [woman]  The state has policies.   We can't take any chances.   
 Which hospital?     
 [woman]  University Children's.   
 Thank you.     
 [whispers] Thank you.     
 - [sighs] f*ck, f*ck, f*ck. 
- [elevator dings]     
 [June] Thank you so much.     
 [man on PA]  Porter to Pediatrics. Porter to Pediatrics.   
 [knocks at door]     
 - Hi. 
- [nurse] Hello.     
 Mummy!     
 Thank you so much.     
 Hey, muffin, how you feeling?     
 - Yucky. 
- I know. I'm sorry, baby.     
 How is she doing?     
 She's fab.     
 Her fever's still a little elevated.     
 The doctor will come talk to you in a bit, but it's probably just a virus.     
 We're still waiting on a few blood tests, and then she can go home.     
 - Oh, thank God. Thank you. 
- Yeah.     
 I do have a few quick questions for you, Mrs. Bankole.     
 June Osborne. Sure.     
 Hannah, I'm gonna steal your mommy for five minutes, all right?     
 - Okay. 
- [nurse] Okay.     
 - I'll be right back, sweetie, okay? 
- [Hannah] Okay.     
 [sighs]     
 [woman on PA]  Doctor Pound to Oncology, please.   
 Doctor Pound, call Oncology.   
 - Sorry, I'm just letting my husband know. 
- Oh, yeah.     
 Um, thank you so much for taking care of her.     
 - Oh, she's so sweet. 
- [sighs] Yeah.     
 - You're really blessed. 
- I am.     
 She's your biological child?     
 
 
 
 - Uh, yes. 
- Hmm.     
 The school was having a hard time reaching you today.     
 I was at work. My cell was in my bag.     
 I understand. You work full-time?     
 Uh-huh. I went back about ten months after Hannah was born.     
 Oof. That must've been hard to leave her.     
 Mmm-hmm. It still is.     
 [nurse] You're husband works full-time as well?     
 - Yup. 
- And where is he today?     
 Uh, he's, uh, at a job site in Quincy.     
 He should be getting back. There's probably traffic.     
 [nurse] What kind of arrangements do you have     
 to take care of your child if she has to stay home from school?     
 How do you mean?     
 If she's sick.     
 I stay home with her or my husband does.     
 [nurse] You have to miss work then?     
 Uh-huh. I miss work.     
 Can I go be with my daughter now?     
 Did you medicate Hannah this morning to lower her fever?     
 Uh, she was just a little warm so I gave her some Tylenol.     
 [nurse] Did you medicate her to bypass the school's fever policy?     
 So you wouldn't have to miss work today?     
 [sighs] She was just...     
 She was a little warm. She wasn't sick.     
 [nurse] Apparently she was.     
 I understand, Mrs. Bankole.     
 We have busy lives.     
 But children are so precious.     
 We have to make certain that they are in a safe home environment with fit parents.     
 I just have a few more questions, Mrs. Bankole.     
 - Osborne. 
- [nurse] Excuse me?     
 It's my name. June Osborne.     
 What are your questions?     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 [Serena] Blessed day.     
 Blessed day.     
 [Serena] So, you're all right?     
 Hmm. Yes, Mrs. Waterford.     
 [Serena] Well, that's very good news.     
 I'd like to be clear.     
 I will not have any more recalcitrance.     
 All of your disruptions,and all of your games and your secrets, all of that smart-girl bullshit is finished.     
 Do you understand me?     
 Don't get upset, Serena.     
 It's bad for the baby.     
 [door opens]     
 [doctor] Well, isn't this a happy day?     
 [Commander Fred] Praised be.     
 A happy day for all of us.     
 Praised be.     
 - Shall we? 
- [doctor] Let's see what we can see.     
 [doctor sighs]     
 [doctor] Oh, try to relax, honey. You'll feel a little pressure.     
 Now, it's still very early, so we won't hear a heartbeat.     
 But if we're lucky...     
 There.     
 There's some pronounced endometrial thickening which is just what we want to see.     
 And there is your child.     
 [Commander Fred] Serena.     
 [doctor] That is the gestational sack, and that is your baby, Mrs. Waterford.     
 [gasps]     
 God has created a new soul.     
 [Serena sniffling]     
 [Commander Fred] Praised be His mercy.     
 Hmm?     
 [doctor] All righty, then.     
 Blessings to the proud parents.     
 We have a few things to go over.     
 God bless you.     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 Thanks. Under His eye.     
 Godspeed, June.

 [door locks]     
 [engine starts]     
 [sighing]     
 [sighs]     
 Yes, I am taking command of all your units.     
 I understand, but the missing Handmaid is with child.     
 Right now, she is the only priority.     
 [birds chirping]     
 [sighing]     
 - [vehicle clattering] 
- [shuddering]     
 [reporter on TV]  ...sources are saying this is likely the deadliest attack   
 - on American soil since  /  . 
- [June] Got it?     
 [reporter  ]  The Department of Homeland Security has yet to weigh in   
 on who might be responsible for this devastating act of terrorism.   
 We are still awaiting for comment from the NSA and FBI.   
 [news reporter]  There are still no claimants of responsibility...   
 - Hey, can you turn that down? 
- Sorry.     
 [June] Let's take your shoes off.     
 Hey, banana.     
 How's she doing?
