 [OFFRED] 
  Previously on The Handmaid's Tale Just send what we need to the house. 
  Might it be more efficient if Offred were to pump for the baby at home? 
  You brought her straight home! 
  It's more convenient to have Offred here. 
  For you? 
  For Nichole! 
  [AUNT LYDIA] 
  You're lucky they agreed. 
  Four couples have refused. 
  I'm wondering why such an important, brilliant man would take in such a shitty Handmaid. 
  We value privacy in this house. 
  Do you understand? 
  God has called me to a higher purpose. 
  You don't believe that. 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  Guardian Isaac never showed up for his shift this morning. 
  - Have you seen Eden around? 
  - I haven't seen her today. 
  I think we may have a situation. 
  [JUDGE] 
  The accused have been found guilty of infidelity. 
  Renounce your sins and plead for His mercy! 
  For I will contend with he who contends with you, and I will save your children. 
  [WIND BLOWS] 
  [OFFRED] 
  This is all she leaves behind. 
  There won't be a marker anywhere. 
  Heretics don't get to rest in peace. 
  Here, they use them as animal feed. 
  Aunt Lydia told us that at The Red Center. 
  Waste not, want not. 
  All we leave behind is the uniform.

  Do you think she sewed this herself? 
  [RITA] 
  Probably. 
  My mother could sew. 
  You know, really sew. 
  I couldn't figure out how to hem Hannah's pants. 
  She was a child. 
  I didn't have a kind word for her. 
  That's not true. 
  I treated her like sh1t. 
  I slept with her husband. 
  I should've tried to help her. 
  [CLOSES BOX] 
  [DOOR UNLATCHES] 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford? 
  Come in. 
  Nichole and I were just talking about lilies. 
  Did she have a lot to say? 
  Yeah. 
  Quite a lot. 
  Can I help you with something? 
  I found this in Eden's things. 
  Serena, look. 
  She wrote notes all over it. 
  It seems like Eden was hiding a multitude of sins. 
  What sins? 
  What? 
  What sins was she hiding? 
  What Serena? 
  She wasn't strong enough. 
  She was 15 years old! 
  Yes, she was 15 years old. 
  She should have been smarter. 
  She was trying to understand God! 
  For f*ck's sake, Serena, she was trying to read the f*cking Bible! 
  Don't use that language in front of my daughter! 
  Do you understand me? 
  How are you going to keep her safe? 
  - [NICHOLE CRIES] 
  - How are you going to keep her safe? 
  What are you going to do? 
  Are you gonna lock her up here like an orchid? 
  [NICHOLE CRIES] 
  My daughter will be raised properly. 
  [SIGHS] 
  She will understand the word of God and she will obey His word. 
  [LOUDLY] 
  She cannot read His word! 
  [LOUDLY]

  [MR. 
  SPENCER] 
  Guardian Blaine, sir, I just want to tell you how sorry I am. 
  We tried to put her on the path to God. 
  I wish I could fix what my Eden did. 
  I pray I could, somehow. 
  By His mercy, all will be forgiven. 
  Bless you. 
  Commander Waterford, Mrs. 
  Waterford. 
  You were so kind to welcome Eden into your godly home. 
  A grave mistake as it turns out. 
  To be repaid with sin and deception. 
  Yes, sir. 
  I am ashamed. 
  Yes. 
  [SERENA] 
  Eden spoke a lot about your farm and how much she missed it. 
  She missed her family. 
  [MR. 
  SPENCER] 
  She was the light of my life. 
  Excuse me. 
  She had a kind heart. 
  You have another daughter? 
  He has truly blessed us. 
  Praised be. 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  Make certain she learns from her sister's transgressions. 
  In tragedy lies opportunity. 
  [MR. 
  SPENCER] 
  Yes, sir. 
  She was home when Eden arrived with that boy. 
  We called the authorities immediately. 
  You turned her in? 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  That kind of faith is rare, indeed. 
  It reflects well upon your family. 
  [MR. 
  SPENCER] 
  God bless you, Commander. 
  May God give you strength during this time of mourning. 
  - [MR. 
  SPENCER] 
  Thank you. 
  - [COMMANDER FRED] 
  Go in grace.

  They should be together here. 
  Why do you only see the bad stuff? 
  Am I complaining all the time? 
  No, I am not. 
  They drowned her in a swimming pool. 
  She died for love. 
  I found a book. 
  It was hidden in her things. 
  It's a Bible. 
  Wow. 
  Brave. 
  Yeah, she was. 
  I have my first Ceremony tonight at the new house. 
  Oh, I hate the first one. 
  It's so awkward. 
  May God bless His endeavor and bring forth His miracle. 
  You'll get through it. 
  Sure. 
  Just imagine your Commander falling into a wood chipper or something. 
  Oh, no. 
  Don't think that! 
  That's awful! 
  Oh, my God! 
  [INDISTINCT VOICE OVER RADIO] 
  I keep dreaming about Oliver. 
  It's his birthday soon?

  Seven years old. 
  Well, we should celebrate. 
  We can bake a cake.

  [NICHOLE CONTINUES FUSSING] 
  I pray things have settled down at your house. 
  They are settling. 
  Thank God. 
  It's tragic, of course. 
  But we have so much to look forward to with our beautiful girls. 
  Yes, we do. 
  Do you worry about that? 
  About what? 
  Their future. 
  [QUIET CONVERSATION] 
  I put my faith in Gilead.

  I suppose all mothers worry. 
  Of course we do. 
  We want to give our children the best life they can have. 
  A life with purpose. 
  That is the dream, of course. 
  For all the children of Gilead. 
  Boys and girls. 
  Yes. 
  Do you think the other women share our concerns? 
  Grace has said a word, now and then. 
  Leah has opinions.

  As faithful servants, it is our duty to ensure that the children of Gilead live by the laws of scripture.

  We believe that our sons and daughters should be taught to read it.
