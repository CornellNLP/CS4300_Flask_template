 OFFRED:  Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 WATERFORD:  Tonight, I'm taking you out.   
 I thought these kinds of places were forbidden.   
 - Who are all these people? 
- All women who couldn't assimilate.   
 I'm so sorry I left you at the train!   
 Janine said you were dead.   
 They gave me a choice. The Colonies or Jezebel's.   
 We're gonna find a way to get you out of here.   
 I know the way out. Black van, feet first.    
 This is Gilead. No one gets out.    
 Why did you bring me here?    
 WATERFORD:  I thought we could just be together.   
 You know I had to go with him last night, right?    
 You know I didn't have a choice.    
 - I don't have any choice. 
- We can't do this anymore.    
 Is this enough for you, this bullshit life?    
 - Is this what you want? 
- It's too dangerous.    
 - You could end up on the wall. 
- At least someone will remember me.    
 At least someone will care when I'm gone.

 WARREN:  "For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden."   
 (COOING)    
 "For, behold, from henceforth, all generations shall call me blessed."    
 (WHISPERS) Ofwarren.    
 Honey.    
 (GASPS) Sorry.    
 (ANGELA GURGLES)    
 "Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children...    
 And they bowed themselves.    
 May the Lord now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I, too, will show you the same favor.    
 The Lord bless thee, and keep thee."    
 (ANGELA CRIES)    
 You know you... You have to burp her when she's halfway through feeding.    
 - I know. 
- Otherwise, she'll just...    
 She'll fuss and she'll spit it all up.    
 I understand.    
 (MOANS)    
 (SIGHS)    
 I told you.    
 Ofwarren.    
 We will cherish this child always.    
 Go in grace.    
 (CRIES)    
 NAOMI: Baba‐ba.    
 Hi, Baba. Hi.

- (ANGELA COUGHING)    
 (VAN ENGINE RUNNING)    
 (DOOR OPENS)    
 - Praised be. 
- Praised be.    
 - Praised be. 
- Blessed be.    
 - Blessed be. 
- Praised be.    
 - Praised be. 
- Blessed be.    
 - Blessed be. 
- Praised be.    
 HANDMAID: Blessed be.    
 (SUITCASE THUMPS)    
 (SNIFFLES)    
 Don't be sad.    
 He's coming for me.    
 Bye!    
 Blessed be.    
 Blessed be.    
 Blessed be.    
 Blessed be.    
 OFFRED: Aunt Lydia?    
 (HANDMAIDS MURMURING)    
 Yes? What is it?    
 (INHALES)    
 Does she seem all right?    
 Considering?    
 She's tougher than you think.    
 Let her be an example to you.    
 To all of you!    
 (BIRDS CHIRPING)    
 Bye!    
 (VAN DOORS CLOSING)    
 (MOURNFUL MUSIC PLAYING)    
 (ALL WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)    
 I want to help.    
 With what?    
 With Mayday.    
 I have no idea what you're talking about.    
 (DOG BARKING)    
 If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity.    
 Praised be.    
 See how they welcome you.    
 Commander Daniel and Mrs. Monroe.    
 You are Ofdaniel now.    
 They live really far.    
 Far from what, dear?    
 Uh, th...    
 Things.    
 (SNIFFLES)     
 I am very proud of you, Ofdaniel.     
 Go to them and be blessed.     
 Go like an open flower.     
 (CROWS CAWING IN DISTANCE)     
 Welcome.     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 It's nice to be out.     
 She could use an extra blanket.     
 She's quiet now. Finally.     
 She's fine.     
 Mrs. Waterford, Mrs. Putnam. 
Is this your blessed child?     
 This is Angela. (CHUCKLES)     
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (GASPS)     
 Well, hello there, sweet girl.     
 GUARD: Ma'am.     
 Under His eye.     
 (RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES)     
 She just wanted a look.     
 Well, we can't be too careful.     
 How did it go this morning?     
 Did Baby Angela take her bottle?     
 She devoured it. No trouble at all.     
 Who needs that horrid girl, right?     
 It's like living with a feral cat.     
 One must still be thankful.     
 You sound like Warren, though he never had to deal with her.     
 You should be grateful. You have such an obedient Handmaid.     
 I'm sure your miracle will come soon.     
 OFGLEN  : Ofwarren is so lucky.     
 I mean Ofdaniel.     
 She's got a sweet new posting.     
 I hear her missus is really nice.     
 Yeah, she's so lucky.     
 (RADIO CHATTER)     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 May the Lord open. (DOORBELL JINGLES)     
 We've been sent good weather.     
 It's freezing, dummy.     
 Too many eyes and ears before.     
 You said you wanted to help?     
 They need you to go back to Jezebel's.     
 What?     
 They've been trying to get a package out of there.     
 Find Rachel at the bar.     
 Wait. How do they know I was there?     
 I don't know. They just do. So, can you?     
 Go back? How?     
 I don't know. Figure it out.     
 What... What's in the package?     
 I just know it's important.     
 And don't open it either.     
 Hide it until someone contacts you.     
 Look, you came to me.     
 And this is what they need now.     
 Can they count on you or not?     
 Okay.     
 I'll try.     
 - Great. 
- (RADIO CHATTER)     
 Tonight would be a good time to go.     
 (STUTTERS) Tonight?     
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)     
 What are you doing down here?     
 I'm sorry.     
 I just wanted to tell you something.     
 Is there a problem?     
 No. Not at all.     
 Well, you shouldn't be out of your room.     
 Not now.     
 You're right.     
 It can wait.     
 Hold on.     
 So?     
 What is it?     
 It's a good thing.     
 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)     
 I just can't stop thinking about when we went out.     
 Our adventure.     
 Enjoyed that, did you?     
 Yes.     
 Very much.     
 It was just so exciting.     
 You know?     
 To dress up for you and sneak past the guards.     
 And then everything we did when we got there.     
 I just wanted to thank you.     
 That's all.     
 Maybe we could go back there sometime.     
 Really?     
 When?     
 - So eager. (CHUCKLES) 
- (CHUCKLES)     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 We'll have to wait, of course, until the house has settled in for the night.     
 You mean, tonight?     
 Oh, you have other plans?     
 (BOTH CHUCKLE)     
 Nah.     
 Good.     
 Tonight would be perfect.     
 Until later, then.     
 (INHALES)     
 (EXHALES DEEPLY)     
 (RAIN PATTERING)     
 Happy?     
 Beyond.     
 You know, I'm very glad you suggested an encore.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 I guess I'll have to think of a way to thank you.     
 Oh, I'll think of something.     
 - (OFFRED LAUGHS) 
- Sir.     
 WATERFORD: Yes, what is it?     
 Coming up to the checkpoint.     
 WATERFORD: Oh, you're no fun.     
 - Nick's no fun, is he? 
- Mmm‐mmm.     
 No, Nick just needs to chill.     
 WATERFORD: (CHUCKLES) You heard her, Nick.     
 - You just need to chill. 
- (BOTH LAUGH)     
 (ELEVATOR HUMMING)     
 Doesn't she look stunning tonight?     
 (WATERFORD LAUGHS)     
 He's so chill he's speechless.     
 You're too much for him to handle.     
 Won't be long.     
 We're going straight up to the room.     
 Yes, sir.     
 I thought we'd have a drink at the bar.     
 Like last time?     
 Maybe after, if there's time.     
 - OFFRED: 'Kay. 
- (ELEVATOR THUDS)     
 (DOORS CLANG)     
 Sir?     
 This trip was so last minute.     
 We don't know who might be here tonight.     
 I just want you to be careful.     
 You're a good man, Nick.     
 Always looking out for me.     
 Shall we?     
 (FIRE CRACKLING)     
 (SNIFFLES)     
 (SNIFFLES)     
 (LOCK CLICKING)     
 (SIGHS)     
 (BOTTLES CLINKING)     
 I'm sorry. (CLEARS THROAT)     
 I thought the Commander came home hungry.     
 He's in his office.     
 Can I help you with anything?     
 I was just looking for the chamomile.     
 You can't sleep?     
 Just restless, I suppose.     
 (WATER RUNNING)     
 Has Offred asked for her napkins this month?     
 No, ma'am.     
 It's not quite her time yet.     
 I'm praying for good news.     
 (POT CLATTERING)     
 Ma'am, may I suggest something with a bit more flavor?     
 To settle the soul?     
 That might be nice.     
 (BOTTLES CLINKING)     
 Make it two, if you like.     
 Okay.     
 Thank you.     
 You should hear Naomi Putnam.     
 She goes on and on about how her baby keeps her awake at night.     
 (INHALES DEEPLY)     
 To complain about such a miracle.     
 She should appreciate every moment.     
 You can lose a child in an instant.     
 My son.     
 I didn't know that you had a son.     
 Matthew.     
 He was   .     
 That must be terribly difficult.     
 It was in the war.     
 I'm humbled by your son's sacrifice.     
 Blessed be they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.     
 Praised be.     
 Don't be shy.     
 I should wait for him downstairs.     
 No, silly. We'll wait right here.     
 The Commander's preparing. He'll be with us in a minute.     
 Up you go.     
 (EXHALES)     
 Scooch over.     
 We're in this together, aren't we?     
 There.     
 That's right.     
 Good.     
 (STAMMERS) No, I should...     
 Shh. It's okay, sweetheart.     
 I'm nervous, too.     
 - (JANINE HUMMING NERVOUSLY) 
- Shh.     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 (SOBS) No.     
 No, I... I don't want...     
 (GASPS)     
 (MUFFLED SOBBING)     
 Be still.     
 (INHALES SHARPLY)     
 You...     
 You, get off me. Get... Get off me!     
 Get the f*ck off me!     
 Don't you f*cking touch me!     
 - EMMA: What's the matter? 
- Where's Warren?     
 No, you're Ofdaniel now.     
 No, no, no!     
 No, no, no, no, no, no!     
 (SOBS) No.     
 No. He's coming for me.     
 (PANTING)     
 He's coming for me.     
 He's coming for me.     
 He's coming for me.     
 (BREATHES HEAVILY)

 (GRUNTS)     
 (GROANS)     
 (EXHALES)     
 (WATERFORD PANTING)     
 Did you like that?     
 Mmm. Yes.     
 Let me know next time.     
 You don't have to be quiet here.     
 You can be free.     
 (PANTING)     
 I'll remember that,     
 for the next time.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 You're getting ahead of yourself.     
 And I don't want to spoil you.     
 So, can we stay for a while?     
 Maybe have that drink?     
 It's all about the bar tonight.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 Why?     
 I like the way that people treat you.     
 They're all so impressed.     
 Offred.     
 Hmm?     
 I'm not dumb.     
 I know why you wanted to come back here.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 What do you mean?     
 To meet someone.     
 I made the arrangements.     
 (MOURNFUL TONE BUILDS)     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 Here she is.     
 Right on time.     
 (DOOR CLOSES)     
 You saw her the last time we were here.     
 You think I don't pay attention, but I do.     
 I know you know Ruby.     
 I know her, too.     
 I thought you'd welcome this little reunion.     
 Aren't you friends?     
 Not that kind of friend.     
 Oh.     
 Of course not.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 Relax. I did something nice for you.     
 WATERFORD: Thank you, Fred.     
 Thank you, Fred.     
 Thank you.     
 Oh, you're welcome.     
 Now you two catch up while I rinse off.     
 (DOOR CLOSES)     
 (SHOWER RUNNING) What the f*ck are you doing back here?     
 So?     
 - I got nothing. 
- Nobody's planning anything stupid?     
 - You ask around at the bar? 
- Mmm‐hmm.     
 The girls in here do two things.     
 They get f*cked or they get f*cked up.     
 They're not in the best shape for a rebellion.     
 What's wrong with your pasta?     
 That's the best f*cking carbonara you'll ever get, I swear.     
 Anybody say anything about Waterford's Handmaid?     
 Why? Is she trouble?     
 Nope. Not a word.     
 Nick.     
 A driver poking around, asking questions?     
 Good way to get yourself up on the wall.     
 Stay here with me.     
 For old times' sake.     
 I can make you something else.     
 They'll be done soon.     
 (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)     
 It's the Handmaid.     
 You're sweet on her, aren't you?     
 It's dangerous, my friend.     
 You're right, this is incredible.     
 (INHALES)     
 
 
 
 - (SHOWER RUNNING) 
- So you're a spy now?     
 I guess.     
 Not a very good one. I can't seem to get out of the f*cking room.     
 Good, because this is f*cking ridiculous.     
 Risking your life because Alma said so?     
 - f*ckin' Alma? 
- It's just a package.     
 It could be anything!     
 A bomb. Anthrax. What do you know?     
 I hope it is.     
 (LAUGHS)     
 Hey. You could get it for me.     
 Hey. No, that is crazy.     
 Moira, do you know Rachel?     
 Hey. No. Okay?     
 No.     
 What is wrong with you?     
 - (SCOFFS) 
- Hey...     
 What?     
 In case you haven't noticed, I'm a prisoner and a whore.     
 - Moira. 
- No. Hey.     
 It's Ruby now.     
 - No. Come on... 
- Just, just stop!     
 Okay, stop!     
 Just go home and just do what they say.     
 Moira, I thought you were dead.     
 I thought they killed you.     
 I thought they strung you up somewhere.     
 To rot.     
 It tore me apart.     
 But I didn't give up like a coward.     
 You think what you want.     
 I think you're a liar.     
 'Cause you said we would find Hannah.     
 - You will find her. 
- No.     
 We will.     
 That's what you said.     
 (VOICE BREAKING) When all of this was over, you...     
 You promised.     
 You f*cking pinky swore.     
 Or don't you remember?     
 Moira, do not...     
 Do not let them grind you down.     
 You keep your f*cking sh1t together.     
 You fight!     
 I was doing all right until I saw you again.     
 (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)     
 (SOBS)     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 She left?     
 Good, she's a degenerate.     
 (SOBS)     
 Pull yourself together.     
 We're going.     
 (MOURNFUL MUSIC PLAYING)     
 It's late.     
 You should get some sleep.     
 Good night then.     
 Good night, dear.     
 I'll see you in the morning.     
 Yes.     
 (DOOR CLOSES)     
 (WAVES LAPPING)     
 (LAUGHING)     
 (LUKE LAUGHS)     
 Ooh! Good one!     
 Oh, you can't match it.     
 (DISTORTED) Offred! Offred, wake up!     
 Wake up! Get dressed! Hurry up!     
 Get up! Get up!     
 - Get up. 
- What's wrong?     
 Get up, get dressed. Quick!     
 Hurry up.     
 (TIRES SCREECHING)     
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)     
 AUNT LYDIA: Hurry!     
 Hurry! Hurry!     
 She fled her posting and she found her way back to the Putnams.     
 Has she hurt anybody?     
 By the grace of God, no, not yet.     
 She tried to run away, and they caught up with her here.     
 (ANGELA CRIES)     
 WARREN: Don't do this.     
 You... You can move home and you can live in the house with her.     
 Yes, we need you.     
 The baby needs you.     
 You hear that?     
 Just come down and let me have Angela.     
 Her name is Charlotte, you lying f*ck!     
 (CRIES)     
 You said we would be a family!     
 She's not well.     
 I was well enough to suck your cock!     
 I did every f*cked‐up thing you wanted!     
 All the freaky sh1t she'd never do because you...     
 You promised me we would run off and we would be a family!     
 All right, that's enough!     
 (ANGELA CRIES)     
 Make her listen.     
 Save that child.     
 Give us some space.     
 I need you to move back.     
 Why is this girl here?     
 They are friends.     
 - Please. 
- I don't care what they are.     
 I am not moving.     
 Putnam.     
 Give her a chance.

 Janine?     
 (JANINE SNIFFLES)     
 (FUSSES)     
 They all think I'm crazy, but I'm not.     
 I know.     
 I know you're not crazy.     
 It's a wonder we're not all crazy.     
 In this place, you know?     
 Janine, change is coming.     
 There's hope.     
 All of this, it's all gonna be over one day.     
 And everything is gonna go back to normal.     
 (LAUGHS)     
 And we are gonna go out.     
 We're gonna go out drinking.     
 (LAUGHS)     
 You and me.     
 (FUSSES)     
 And Moira?     
 Yeah.     
 - And Alma? 
- Yeah.     
 (BOTH LAUGH)     
 Can we, uh...     
 - Can we do karaoke? 
- Sure.     
 (BOTH LAUGH)     
 Whatever you want.     
 We're gonna... We're gonna get hammered.     
 We're gonna go dancing,     
 and we'll watch the sun come up.     
 (STAMMERS)     
 No. (SNIFFLES)     
 Who would wanna dance with me?     
 (COOS)     
 (RADIO CHATTER)     
 Come with me. (SNIFFLES)     
 It can't hurt very much.     
 No, just for a second, and then... (SNIFFLES)     
 And then we'll be free.     
 I can't.     
 I'm sorry.     
 I can't 'cause of my daughter.     
 Janine.     
 - (FUSSES) 
- OFFRED: Listen to me.     
 Janine, you have to do what's best for your daughter now.     
 (SOBS)     
 (FUSSES)     
 You have to give her the chance to grow up.     
 (COOS)     
 (WHIMPERS)

 Mommy loves you.
