 [grunts in pain]   
 [Offred]  Previously on "The Handmaid's Tale"...   
 [aunt Lydia]  You were an adulterer.   
 A worthless slut.   
 But God found a way to make you useful.   
 [June]  We are prisoners.   
 You have to tell people what's happening here.   
 Please don't forget me. Please don't forget us all.   
 Listen, they've made contact.    
 You should probably get ready to go.    
 Come on.    
 - Where are we going? 
- Airstrip west of Worcester.    
 Thank you for taking me in.    
 This wasn't my decision.    
 So, are you brave or... stupid?    
 I'm not brave.    
 [June]  It's almost  :  . 
 Maybe they ran into friends.   
 Maybe a lot of things.   
 - Who are you? 
- [June] I'm the Handmaid.    
 [June] No! [panting]    
 - No! 
- [men grunting]    
 [screams] No!    
 [footsteps approaching]    
 [switch clicks, compressor whirring]    
 [compressor bangs]    
 [gasping]    
 [June]  I heard a story 
 on NPR once about pig balls.   
 For pigs who were being fattened in pens.   
 The pigs rolled the balls around with their snouts.   
 And the pig marketers said it improved their muscle tone.   
 The pigs were curious. They liked having something to think about.   
 Caged rats will give themselves electric shocks for something to do.   
 There are    flowers on the comforter.   
 Seventy-one.   
 I wish I had a pig ball.   
 [door opens]    
 [door closes]    
 [door opens]    
 Blessed be the fruit.    
 I see you've eaten well, Offred.    
 Third day in a row.    
 It's June.    
 You know my f*cking name.    
 The Waterfords have kindly agreed to a trial run, as it were.    
 And if you're a very, very good girl, you might even be invited to stay.    
 You see, June will be chained in this room    
 until she gives birth.    
 And then June will be... executed.    
 Offred has an opportunity.    
 It would be better for the baby.    
 [door opens and closes]    
 [chain rattling]    
 You'll have to earn your place. 
Prove that you're worthy.    
 [indistinct radio chatter]    
 [wind blowing]    
 [crystals chiming]    
 [Offred]  Seventy-one flowers.   
 The bedspread has    flowers.   
 [wind whooshes]    
 Posture, dear.    
 [door opens]    
 [Commander Fred] 
Well. Isn't this a happy day?    
 Welcome home, Offred.    
 Thanks.    
 We are grateful to the Lord for the safe return of our baby.    
 [aunt Lydia] Ah, praised be His mercy.    
 - Praised be. 
- [aunt Lydia] Mmm.    
 It wasn't easy finding you.    
 The terrorist networks in Gilead are insidious.    
 But we were determined to rescue you... from your kidnappers.    
 And God blessed our endeavor.    
 You've been through quite a trial.    
 Haven't you?    
 Uh-huh.    
 [footsteps approaching]    
 And the ransomed of the Lord shall return.    
 Praised be.    
 Offred?    
 Praised be.    
 [aunt Lydia] What a lovely homecoming.    
 Now, Offred needs to clean up and get some rest.    
 I know the way.    
 [Offred]  Kidnapping. Of course.   
 Kidnapping is the story everyone can live with.   
 Martha. A word?    
 [Offred]  The Waterfords 
 can keep the baby.   
 Shows off Gilead's reach and might.   
 [aunt Lydia]  You have a very important job, an essential job.   
 Now, everything must be washed.   
 Fruits, vegetables, meat. And especially poultry...   
 [sighing]    
 [dog barking]    
 [wind blowing]    
 [breathing heavily]    
 [footsteps approaching]     
 - [Serena grunts] 
- [gasps]     
 [chokes]     
 [gasping] Ninety-two days!     
 [stifled grunting, gasping]     
 [sniffs, exhales sharply]     
 - [stifled grunt] 
- [coughs]     
 [panting]     
 [Offred] Serena.     
 Remember.     
 As long as my baby is safe... so is yours.     
 [breathing heavily]     
 [water trickling]     
 [tub squeaking]     
 [light switch clicks]     
 [dog barking]     
 [breathes deeply]     
 [door opens]     
 Lights are down, but not to worry.     
 [sing-song] Rub-a-dub-dub.     
 Be sure to wash everywhere.     
 No, dear. I mean down there.     
 You don't want any nasty bacteria getting to the baby, do you?     
 [water lapping]     
 Ooh! Water's getting cool.     
 Finish up and off to bed.     
 Baby needs rest.     
 [door closes]     
 [footsteps recede]     
 [sighs]     
 Good morning, dear.     
 - Did you have sweet dreams? 
- Ah!     
 Sure.     
 Wonderful.     
 And you have a nice, clean dress.     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 Yeah. May the Lord open.     
 [aunt Lydia] Get dressed and wash your face.     
 Rita, make sure the water's not too hot.     
 Try to avoid any kind of shock to the system.     
 Yes.     
 We'll see you downstairs.     
 I hope you're hungry.     
 [whispers] Hi.     
 Here.     
 Take them.     
 Rita, wait!     
 Someone was supposed to contact you.     
 I can't.     
 [whispers] What if she finds them?     
 You don't know what it's been like.     
 [sighs]     
 [breathes heavily]     
 [Martha  ] Can you move these chairs over here?     
 [Martha  ] Yes, of course.     
 [Martha  ] Pardon me.     
 [Martha  ] Those are the ones she wants.     
 [aunt Lydia] Offred, love?     
 God provides all we need in His bounty, but it is our duty to choose vitamins and minerals in wise proportion to support the baby.     
 Offred. Sit.     
 We have a very special day planned, dear.     
 Everyone wants to celebrate our miracle.     
 [blender whirring]     
 [Serena] Nick!     
 The guests are arriving soon.     
 Can you please make sure that everything is ready?     
 Yes, ma'am.     
 Drink up, dear.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 [chuckles]     
 You can do much better than that, can't you?     
 Excellent.     
 [gasps]     
 [coughing and choking]     
 [panting]     
 Sorry, Aunt Lydia.     
 We'll make another. 
You need your vitamins.     
 [liquid pouring]     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 - [woman] Oh! 
- [Serena] This is so pretty. Thank you.     
 [Wife  ] I have to try. Can I try it?     
 [Wife   laughing] Oh, yes. Give it a go. See what it does.     
 [Wife  ] Oh, does it move?     
 [Wives exclaim and laugh]     
 [toy quacking]     
 [Serena] It's darling!     
 [Wife  ] I just couldn't... 
I couldn't resist it.     
 [Wives continue chatting indistinctly]     
 This is stunning. This is perfect!     
 - [Wives exclaim] 
- [Wife  ] Beautiful! Look at the stitching!     
 [Serena] Thank you so much.     
 Thank you very much.     
 Do you want something to drink?     
 Do you want tea or something?     
 [Serena] Leah, thank you so much.     
 [Leah] I knitted it myself.     
 - [Wife  ] Leah is just so talented. 
- [Wife  ] So talented.     
 Bring mine in.     
 [Wives exclaim and laugh]     
 [Serena] This is too much. Thank you.     
 [Naomi] You deserve some joy in your life.     
 Having your baby kidnapped.     
 I can't imagine how relieved you must be.     
 - [Leah] You're absolutely glowing. 
- [Wife  ] Mmm-hmm.     
 Oh, yes, thank you. 
We, um... We're very blessed.     
 [Leah] It's such a shame you missed the baby's first trimester.     
 [Naomi] Ugh, I couldn't breathe until Angela's first kick.     
 Well, I think it's still too early for that.     
 I felt the baby kick for the first time last night.     
 [Naomi] Praised be.     
 [Wives chuckle] Praised be.     
 [Wives continue chatting indistinctly]     
 [glass clinks]     
 [Wife  ] Who's next?     
 - [Naomi] Yellow ribbon. 
- Mmm.     
 [aunt Lydia] Do you need to take a break?     
 No. Having a great time.     
 [laughter]     
 [clay shatters]     
 I appreciate you all including a fifth.     
 Well, a chance to celebrate life is a gift to us all.     
 [Linus] Praised be.     
 May I say that it's very sporting of you to have come, despite your handicap.     
 Cushing. You're up.     
 You ready for Canada, Commander?     
 Yes. I think we can move them closer to easing sanctions.     
 It's a process.     
 [Glen] Pull.     
 - [gunshot] 
- [clay shatters]     
 I fail to see how our domestic affairs are any concern to the Canadians.     
 I'd be happy to remind them of that.     
 If the Committee saw fit to name me special envoy and send me up north as well.     
 [Andrew] Pull.     
 [clay shatters]     
 Have things settled in your home, Commander?     
 It is a blessing to have my house in order.     
 Back in order.     
 Yes.     
 [Andrew] Good.     
 Family is very important.     
 I agree.     
 Let us all pray for a full-term pregnancy and a successful birth.     
 By His hand.     
 [Andrew] Pull!     
 [clay shatters]     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 [aunt Lydia] 
It's a beautiful celebration.     
 Yes. Thank you.     
 [aunt Lydia] Mrs. Waterford,     
 I've worked with many 
Wives and Handmaids.     
 This part is always hard.     
 Mothers. Mothers and Handmaids.     
 [sighs]     
 It's only natural to resent her.     
 God will forgive you for that.     
 Well, she makes it difficult.     
 Hmm. She's strong.     
 But that means your child will be strong.     
 You understand that everything that happens now     
 must be for the good of the child.     
 Are you sure that she understands that?     
 I will make sure of it.     
 No more of this.     
 Bad for the baby.     
 [aunt Lydia steps on cigarette]     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 [sighs]     
 - [bell ringing] 
- [indistinct chatter]     
 [whispering] Hey!     
 - [whispering] Hey. 
- Hi.     
 You almost made it?     
 Almost.     
 That sucks.     
 Everyone was sh1tting themselves.     
 Did anyone from Mayday get caught?     
 I don't know.     
 Mayday's gone silent.     
 For how long?     
 They're done helping Handmaids.     
 Ofglen! Ofglen!     
 They cut out her tongue.     
 After she stood up for Janine.     
 You didn't make her say anything.     
 This wasn't your fault.     
 Not that part.     
 [aunt Lydia] Oh!     
 Come along, dear. It's time.     
 [Offred]  I would like   to be without shame.   
 I would like to be shameless.   
 I would like to be ignorant.   
 Then I would not know   
 how ignorant I was.   
 Behold he who does great and unsearchable things...     
 [Wives and Handmaids] Wonders without number.     
 [Serena] Let the little children come to me.     
 [Wives and Handmaids] For of such is the kingdom of heaven.     
 Let the little children come to me.     
 [Wives and Handmaids] For of such is the kingdom of heaven.     
 [Serena] Let the little children come to me.     
 [Wives and Handmaids] For of such is the kingdom of heaven.     
 [Serena] Let the little children come to me.     
 [Wives and Handmaids] For of such is the kingdom of heaven.     
 [softly] Let the little children come to me.     
 [Wives and Handmaids] For of such is the kingdom of heaven.     
 [Serena] Let the little children come to me.     
 [Wives and Handmaids] For of such is the kingdom of heaven.     
 [softly] Let the little children come to me.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 - June? 
- [June] Yeah.     
 I'm Annie.     
 Luke's wife.     
 Hi.     
 I need you...     
 I wanna ask you to back off.     
 Give us the space we need to work on our marriage. Please.     
 You should probably talk to Luke about this.     
 You don't think I have?     
 Jesus, all we do is talk about this.     
 He thinks he's in love with you.     
 I still love him.     
 Sometimes people grow apart.     
 We made vows before God.     
 That means something.     
 He's a good man who wants to do the right thing.     
 You have to let him do it.     
 I have to go.     
 
 
 
 [Annie] No, you can't just wreck people's lives like they don't matter.     
 Did you ever even think about me?     
 About what you were doing to me?     
 Do you think about me when you're screwing my husband, you selfish bitch?     
 He's just playing with you.     
 He'll come back home to me.     
 You've been separated for three months.     
 You are never going to know him like I do.     
 I was his first, did he tell you that?     
 You think you can just take him from me 'cause you want him?     
 f*cking whore!     
 [siren wailing nearby]     
 [breathing heavily]     
 [Luke] Why would you even think that would work?     
 [stammers] What were you trying to achieve?     
 You're trying to convince her that she shouldn't be with me?     
 You think that some... that I'm gonna come back?     
 You're gonna have a word with her, I'm gonna wanna come back to you?     
 That's stu... You gotta move on! 
All right?     
 It's done! I've spoken to you! 
You're being a f*cking coward!     
 If you wanna talk to me, if you got a problem with me, then you come talk to me!     
 All right? Come talk to me! Don't talk to her! Don't call her!     
 Don't f*cking stalk her! 
Just leave her the f*ck alone!     
 Are you okay?     
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.     
 I'm fine.     
 - Did you just hang up on her? 
- Uh...     
 No, that's... there's voicemail.     
 - Babe... 
- You shouldn't have done that.     
 No, no, no, listen. Listen.     
 She's trying to wreck my life, all right?     
 I'm... She's trying to wreck our life.     
 I don't know. When we started this, you weren't even separated.     
 What if I hadn't come along?     
 No. Don't... don't feel guilty.     
 You didn't take me from her.     
 I love you more than I've ever loved her.     
 I hate this.     
 No, listen. You stop. Stop, stop, okay?     
 Because this is what she wants. 
This is what she does.     
 She just... She gets right in there.     
 She's trying to drive a wedge.     
 [softly] Okay? And I...     
 [softly] And I love you. 
I love you. So much.     
 Me too.     
 Just forget about her.     
 She doesn't matter to us. Right?     
 Right? She doesn't matter to us because we gonna get married, right?     
 'Cause I'm gonna make you happy.     
 [chuckles softly]     
 I'm gonna...     
 [softly] Baby, I promise you.     
 I promise you. I'm sorry about that.     
 [xylophone playing notes]     
 It was a beautiful shower.     
 [Rita] Look at all of this.     
 So much love for the baby.     
 [Serena] It's going to be a challenge making sure my child doesn't grow up spoiled.     
 You know, after my shower, we ended up giving away half our gifts.     
 Why don't we put these away?     
 Ma'am, let me help you with that.     
 [Rita yelps]     
 Let's stretch our legs.     
 No, no, no, no.     
 [Offred breathing shakily]     
 Right here. No, no, no.     
 - [jazz music playing] 
- [door opens]     
 [Commander Fred] Serena?     
 I want her out of my house.     
 - [music stops] 
- Why don't you sit down?     
 No. You said it would be my decision!     
 - Yes. 
- Good.     
 Good, then. She'll go back to the Red Center and she'll have the baby, and then I don't care where she goes after that!     
 Are you certain that's what you want?     
 I can't have her in the house, Fred.     
 You're strong.     
 You don't want to miss this pregnancy.     
 [Commander Fred sighs]     
 We've missed so much already.     
 You deserve this.     
 And you're not going to let her take any part of it away from you.     
 You're going to be a wonderful mother.     
 Just think about the baby, hmm?     
 Not her. She's nothing.     
 [aunt Lydia] This isn't easy for her.     
 Don't think it's easy for me either.     
 I'm doing my best.     
 You were a fallen woman.     
 I am trying to give you the best chance you can have.     
 I believe you know him.     
 He drove a bread delivery truck.     
 [Offred shuddering]     
 The wife will redeem herself by serving as a Handmaid.     
 The boy will never see his mother again.     
 [sobbing quietly]     
 - He has been placed with new parents. 
- No. No.     
 Parents who are fit.     
 Gilead has shown them mercy.     
 They will have a chance at a better life.     
 [continues sobbing]     
 Of course, if you asked them, this would not have been the path they would have chosen.     
 But you didn't ask them, did you?     
 You chose for them.     
 Such a selfish girl.     
 Who killed him?     
 Answer me, please.     
 [shuddering]     
 Whose fault was it? Huh?     
 [voice breaks]     
 [softly] My fault.     
 Who induced him to commit such a crime?     
 - I did. 
- Offred?     
 I did.     
 And why did God allow such a terrible thing to happen?     
 Answer me.     
 Offred.     
 To teach me a lesson.     
 To teach June a lesson.     
 [continues shuddering]     
 [shushing]     
 June did this.     
 June ran away.     
 June consorted with terrorists.     
 Not Offred.     
 Offred was kidnapped.     
 Offred is free from blame.     
 Offred does not have to bear June's guilt.     
 [cries softly]     
 [shushing]     
 Commander and...     
 Mrs. Waterford...     
 I would very much like to stay here at home.     
 If you'll have me.     
 Manners?     
 [softly] Please.     
 Do you have anything else to say?     
 I am not worthy yet.     
 I am so grateful for everything...     
 you've done for me.     
 [softly] Please.     
 Let me try to be good.     
 [aunt Lydia] Wonderful.     
 God will certainly bless this house with peace.     
 I have confidence in you all.     
 You'll find your way.     
 [lullaby playing]     
 [door creaking]     
 [door closes]     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 All will be well, and all will be well.     
 All manner of things will be well.     
 Momma loves you.     
 [door creaking]     
 [door closes]     
 [Offred]  My fault.   
 My fault.   
 My fault.   
 My fault.   
 My fault.   
 [Luke]  Come on. We're gonna go to Mommy.   
 [Luke] Let's get you a chair.     
 [woman] Hi. Can I get an Americano?     
 [cooing]     
 [Hannah whimpers]     
 [Offred]  I have done something wrong.   
 Something so huge I can't even see it,   
 something that's drowning me.   
 I am inadequate and stupid, without worth.   
 I might as well be dead.   
 Please, God, let Hannah forget me.   
 Let me forget me.   
 Hey.     
 [birds chirping]     
 [sighs]     
 Look, I'm sorry.     
 I tried everything to get you out.     
 [Offred] We've been sent good weather.     
 [Nick] June.     
 June!     
 [indistinct radio chatter]     
 [Offred]  We've been sent good weather.   
 We've been sent good weather.   
 We've been sent good weather.   
 We've been sent good weather.
