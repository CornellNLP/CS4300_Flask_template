  Where'd you get this? 
  - They fell when I moved the trunk. 
  - Did you read these? 
  - [EDEN] 
  Of course not. 
  I left a first draft of your agenda for the Canadian trip. 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  Now, I'm sure you'll be glad that things are back to normal. 
  You saw her the last time we were here. 
  I know you know Ruby. 
  I know her, too. 
  [RACHEL] 
  As soon as we know more, we'll let you know. 
  I promise. 
  [MOIRA] 
  Luke, hey. 
  Where're you going? 
  You don't want to know that she's okay? 
  [LUKE] 
  She's not okay. 
  She's alive. 
  Have faith that she's alive. 
  You involved the Handmaid in your transgressions? 
  I did what I thought was necessary. 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  Now we must make amends.

  This could be an Airbnb. 
  Not a great one. 
  Three-star reviews, maybe. 
  "Amazing house, tons of character, nice view of the yard. 
  Owners are super polite, but creepy as f*ck. 
  Some ritualized rape required. 
  " Or it could be a room in a rooming house of former times, for ladies in reduced circumstances. 
  That's what I am now. 
  My circumstances have been reduced. 
  I suppose I'm one of the lucky ones. 
  I still have circumstances. 
  A chair, sunlight. 
  I'm alive. 
  I feel the baby move. 
  These are not small things. 
  These are not things to be dismissed. 
  These are the things that are possible, in my reduced circumstances. 
  This room, this house, the way to the store and back. 
  Everything else is impossible. 
  Hannah. 
  Luke. 
  A dive bar with great music. 
  A really sharp machete. 
  It does no good to want the impossible. 
  [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
  - Blessed day. 
  - [RITA] 
  Blessed day. 
  We've been summoned. 
  [OFFRED] 
  What's happening? 
  They'd tell me? 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO] 
  Ah, there you are. 
  I hope I didn't keep you waiting. 
  I'm taking a short trip for work. 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford will be joining me. 
  While we're gone, Isaac will watch over the house and the baby. 
  Blessed be the fruit. 
  May the Lord open. 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  I know you all will be on your best behavior. 
  Yes, sir. 
  Yes. 
  Where are you going? 
  Canada. 
  Praise be. 
  The terrorist attack has given us an opening for diplomacy. 
  Maybe some good can come from this tragedy. 
  My trust in you. 
  Keep them safe. 
  Yes, sir. 
  I will.

  The gray mold is back. 
  I already lost a tray of cuttings. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Fred, you don't need me to come with you. 
  The plants will survive. 
  I promise. 
  It's the third trimester. 
  This trip is for the baby. 
  We're building his future. 
  You're a crucial part of that. 
  Canadians think women here are oppressed. 
  That they're voiceless. 
  I need you. 
  To show them a strong Gilead wife. 
  Who can find a virtuous woman? 
  For her price is far above rubies. 
  Why don't you get cleaned up? 
  [SNIFFLING] 
  [SIGHS] 
  I made these. 
  For your international travels. 
  They have real chocolate chips. 
  Rita had a token. 
  I've never seen a token for chocolate before. 
  Thank you. 
  They look good. 
  You're welcome. 
  Such an honor. 
  You're going to be representing Gilead. 
  I'm on a security detail. 
  The Waterfords want to show off the best. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO] 
  I'm gonna miss you. 
  It's just a few days. 
  I know. 
  I'm still going to.

  How are you feeling? 
  Good. 
  Tired. 
  It's not long now. 
  No. 
  God will watch over you, my love. 
  I hate to leave. 
  We will be fine. 
  I promise. 
  Blessings for a safe trip. 
  Thank you. 
  Offred, I've given it some thought. 
  You'll be leaving the house as soon as the baby is born. 
  No, the The Handmaids stay till the baby is weaned. 
  Well, I think we've all had more than enough of one another. 
  Don't you? 
  Yes Mrs.

  Security was tight today at Toronto Pearson International Airport for a historic occasion. 
  - The first visit to Canada - [GASPING] 
  [LUKE] 
  What's up? 
  That's Waterford. 
  [FEMALE REPORTER] 
  The identity of the official, seen here with his wife, has not been made public, nor has an agenda for the visit. 
  Here is political reporter Brent with more. 
  [MALE REPORTER] 
  Trade will almost certainly be a major topic of discussion. 
  Our economy is still recovering from the loss of the former United States as trading partner. 
  Another long-hoped-for-goal is calming tensions along the Canada-Gilead border. 
  A lot of work to be done there, and today marks a promising start. 
  [FEMALE REPORTER] 
  Thank you, Brent. 
  A spokesperson for the American government in Anchorage expressed deep disappointment at Canada's perceived normalizing of Gilead and its controversial, even retrograde policies. 
  The Canadian government did not respond  
  [MOIRA] 
  He needs to be arrested. 
  It's not possible. 
  He's a f*cking war criminal! 
  I agree, but right now it's not possible. 
  - He kidnapped my wife! 
  - He's a serial rapist! 
  Just send some Marines to the goddamn airport  
  - and arrest him! 
  - Moira! 
  This isn't our country. 
  In the end, we are guests of the Canadian government. 
  You're not gonna do anything about it. 
  There's protests planned. 
  I encourage you to speak out. 
  What's the point? 
  I wish there was more I could do. 
  Yeah. 
  Thanks for your time.

  Commander Waterford, welcome. 
  Stuart Williston. 
  PMO. 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  How do you do? 
  This is our Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Claudine Fournier. 
  [COMMANDER FRED] 
  Enchante. 
  Vous parlez francais? 
  Uh [SPEAKING FRENCH] 
  And our associate, Deputy Minister for Immigration, Kevin McConnell.

  [KEVIN] 
  I was very fond of visiting the States before. 
  With my husband. 
  Well, in the coming years, we anticipate that tourism will be a key part of our economy again. 
  I hope that you'll both return. 
  When we feel welcome. 
  Commander Waterford, please follow me. 
  We'll be meeting down here for most of the day. 
  - Mrs. 
  Waterford, I'm Genevieve. 
  - [SERENA] 
  Pleasure to meet you. 
  Here is your schedule of today's cultural activities. 
  Oh, thank you. 
  How lovely. 
  [GENEVIEVE] 
  I'll show you to your room. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [SERENA] 
  These orchids are just exquisite. 
  Mine are so finicky with moisture. 
  [GENEVIEVE] 
  Is gardening a common hobby for Wives? 
  - Am I using that term correctly? 
  - Yes, thank you. 
  Um, it is quite common, I think. 
  Although everybody does have their own passions. 
  What about you? 
  [GENEVIEVE] 
  I don't have much time outside of work. 
  When I can, I read. 
  I studied French literature at university. 
  I like to cook, but I don't get much opportunity. 
  Honestly, I really do work a lot. 
  Too much, probably. 
  Well, for some people, their work is their passion, if you're truly blessed. 
  I'm told you enjoy knitting as well? 
  Yes, yes, very much so. 
  - I can make a bad scarf, or a bad hat.

  That's about it.

  [CHUCKLES] 
  I think Mrs. 
  Putnam's gonna let me see Charlotte again soon. 
  She say that? 
  No, but I have a feeling. 
  Charlotte smells like me. 
  I used to sniff her head while she was nursing, and she's just You just You can't keep people apart who smell like each other. 
  You just can't. 
  [ISAAC] 
  Quiet. 
  [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
  When the baby comes, don't forget to ask for your ice cream. 
  Serena isn't gonna let me stay. 
  What? 
  No, that's not fair! 
  You have to nurse her. 
  - [ISAAC] 
  Hey! 
  - Well, no, she needs her mommy! 
  - [ISAAC] 
  I said, be quiet! 
  - You be quiet! 
  - Come on, Janine.

  Well, I wouldn't presume. 
  Oh, I do. 
  All the time. 
  Do you mind if I join you? 
  Too presumptuous, right? 
  Sorry. 
  My other vice is talking very respectfully to beautiful women. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm afraid I don't speak to the press. 
  Well, lucky me. 
  I'm not the press. 
  - For later? 
  - No, thank you. 
  - Not a smoker? 
  - Mmm. 
  I quit, so your information is out of date. 
  We do our best. 
  We? 
  Mark. 
  Tuello. 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford. 
  Blessed day. 
  Blessed day to you. 
  So, you're from the embassy? 
  No. 
  But I am a representative of the American government. 
  Which American government is that? 
  We're still a nation. 
  Smaller than before. 
  But we still wield some power. 
  That's true. 
  But alliances are always shifting. 
  Very true. 
  So, what do you do for your American government? 
  Mmm. 
  I've got a Got a good job, actually. 
  I help people. 
  It's very rewarding. 
  I can help you. 
  With what? 
  Well, you don't want a cigarette. 
  Maybe a new life. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  No, thank you. 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford, we could have you on a plane to Honolulu in an hour. 
  You'd never have to go back to Gilead again. 
  I'm afraid I didn't pack for the beach. 
  You could tell your story in your own words. 
  You write it, and we will publish it. 
  A Commander's Wife would make excellent propaganda. 
  A well-spoken Commander's Wife. 
  Do you really think that I would leave my home? 
  People often leave their homes in search of a better life. 
  So far, all you've offered me is treason and coconuts. 
  Gilead blames the fertility crisis on women. 
  On their sinfulness. 
  We see the problem often originating with the men. 
  Some of the best scientists in America have been working on fertility for years. 
  And they've made some progress. 
  Now, think of it. 
  A baby of your own. 
  And freedom. 
  I have a child on the way. 
  That's not your child. 
  You don't know what you're talking about. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I meant no offense. 
  If you had done better research, you would know that I would never betray my country. 
  I thought you already did. 
  It was nice to meet you, Mr. 
  Tuello. 
  Pleasure. 
  I've read so much about you. 
  I didn't think we'd ever get the chance. 
  Maybe we'll run into each other again.

  - Mmm-hmm. 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford wants me to leave the house as soon as the baby comes. 
  And she's the boss. 
  Must be what she thinks is best. 
  Do you? 
  It doesn't matter what I think. 
  When Hannah was baptized, we asked my best friend to take care of her. 
  In case something happened to us. 
  I know what a godparent is. 
  And they don't baptize babies here. 
  I know. 
  I want my baby to know kindness. 
  I need her to have someone kind in her life. 
  By His hand. 
  That boy downstairs is maybe 20 years old. 
  And he can tell me to do anything. 
  He could break my jaw, and no one would say boo. 
  I'll do what I can.

  Hey, hey, you're gonna remember my face, 'cause I'm gonna remember yours. 
  And this is all going to be over someday, you piece of sh1t. 
  You should remember your scripture, Mr. Bankole.

  Maybe you can get them out. 
  Who are you? 
  I'm just a driver.

  And you tell her that Moira made it out, and that she's living with me now. 
  And you tell her that I love her. 
  And you tell her that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna stop. 
  No matter what happens, I'm not gonna stop.

  [CARS HONKING IN THE DISTANCE] 
  You're in the home stretch now. 
  How are you feeling? 
  All right. 
  Your young Guardian told me there were some problems yesterday. 
  With disobedience. 
  I spoke out of turn. 
  I see. 
  It won't happen again. 
  Sometimes, late in pregnancy, there can be a rush of hormones. 
  Girls get quite forgetful. 
  I've been a bit spacey these days. 
  Perfectly normal. 
  But we must all remember to try and follow the rules. 
  Yes, Aunt Lydia. 
  [BLOOD PRESSURE METER HISSING] 
  Wonderful. 
  Aunt Lydia, can I be honest with you? 
  Of course, dear. 
  The reason why I was talking to Janine yesterday is 'cause I was worried. 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford said I have to leave the house soon as the baby comes. 
  That is her prerogative, of course. 
  Whatever the mother feels is right for the welfare of the baby. 
  Right. 
  Uh I want that as well. 
  Good. 
  [OFFRED] 
  You know that this can be a difficult house. 
  Children need to be in a safe place. 
  I know what children need. 
  Did anyone ever ask you to be a godmother? 
  In the time before? 
  I will make allowances for girls in your condition, but insolence is not permitted. 
  This baby is gonna come into this house very soon. 
  And, in my experience, any man who would hurt a woman would hurt a child. 
  What are you saying? 
  I'm saying I'm saying this baby needs protection. 
  I would never, ever allow anything to happen to a baby. 
  Praise be. 
  Aunt Lydia, thank you. 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  I was godmother to my sister's child. 
  He died when he was four days old.

  [CHUCKLES] 
  I don't understand. 
  You and your wife are no longer welcome in Canada. 
  Forgive me, is there an issue? 
  Last night, someone uploaded a series of letters from women in your country, and the public reaction here in Canada has been overwhelming. 
  [COMMANDER FRED]
