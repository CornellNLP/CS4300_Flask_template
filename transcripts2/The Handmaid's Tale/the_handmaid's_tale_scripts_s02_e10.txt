 [Offred] 
  Previously on The Handmaid's Tale My circumstances have been reduced. 
  I suppose I'm one of the lucky ones. 
  [aunt Pauline] 
  You! 
  Move! 
  Move! 
  [Janine] 
  My posting's like a blessing from God. 
  The real blessing was that bomb. 
  Anyone helping Gilead deserves to be blown apart. 
  [Eden] 
  I was thinking maybe I could spruce up our house? 
  - Whatever you want. 
  - Praise be. 
  Uh-huh. 
  [Nick] 
  You know, I think about us. 
  What we could be. 
  I think about it too. 
  [Serena] 
  Offred, I've given it some thought. 
  You'll be leaving the house as soon as the baby is born. 
  I think we've all had more than enough of one other. 
  Don't you? 
  [Offred] 
  I know I should accept the reality of you being born here, make my peace. 
  But f*ck that. 
  [bell chiming] 
  [Offred] 
  You treat it like a job, an unpleasant job, to be gotten through as fast as possible. 
  Kissing is forbidden. 
  This makes it bearable. 
  One detaches oneself. 
  One describes. 
  An act of copulation, fertilization perhaps. 
  No more to you than a bee is to a flower. 
  [Commander grunts] 
  [Offred] 
  You steel yourself. 
  You pretend not to be present, not in the flesh. 
  You leave your body. 
  [Commander grunting] 
  [Commander gasping] 
  [Commander's wife] 
  Roy? 
  Roy! 
  [Commander's wife gasping] 
  Oh, no! 
  Get help! 
  Chances are better if I lay on my back afterwards. 
  What? 
  Doris! 
  Call the ambulance! 
  [door opens] 
  [footsteps thudding] 
  [music playing] 
  [indistinct chatter] 
  [woman] 
  Praise be. 
  - [Alma] 
  Oh, my God! 
  - [Oferic] 
  I know, right? 
  I heard his wife had to get him off of her. 
  I heard he was inside her. 
  Ew. 
  [indistinct chatter] 
  [handmaid whispering] 
  I know, that's what I heard, when they found her. 
  [door opens] 
  [door closing] 
  [indistinct chatter on radio] 
  [indistinct chatter on radio] 
  I was thinking of making a sweet custard pie for tonight. 
  Okay. 
  Sounds good to me. 
  [Martha] 
  I'm making a stew but I was wondering what you suggest. 
  A bisque or a stew would be nice, too. 
  [suspenseful music playing] 
  [gasping] 
  [panting] 
  [radio chatter] 
  [Offred] 
  Hey, are you okay? 
  She's going to a new posting soon. 
  Maybe it won't be as bad this time. 
  [Offred] 
  Hey! 
  Listen. 
  I have news. 
  Moira made it to Canada. 
  She made it. 
  She got out. 
  Oh, praise be. 
  Maybe we could all end up in Canada one day. 
  Do you hear that, Emily? 
  You cannot give up. 
  You're gonna see your son again. 
  [indistinct background chatter] 
  [Offred] 
  Emily. 
  I'm not his mother anymore. 
  Of course, you are. 
  You are his mother, and you love him. 
  You think he feels that? 
  Yes! 
  [indistinct chatter over radio] 
  What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
  At least your son is in Canada. 
  He's free! 
  With your wife! 
  You [gasping] 
  [Eden] 
  Contraction? 
  [gasping] 
  Okay. 
  [Eden] 
  Help! 
  She's going into labor. 
  [Eden] 
  Praise be. 
  It's time. 
  [handmaid] 
  Praise be. 
  [Isaac] 
  Stand back. 
  [sirens approaching] 
  [indistinct chatter] 
  You okay? 
  Yeah, I'm all right. 
  Let's go up. 
  [somber music playing] 
  [door opening] 
  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee. 
  And before thou camest out of the womb, I sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. 
  [Serena sighs] 
  We did it, Offred. 
  And this is the will of God and we shall rejoice and be glad in it. 
  No one knows the things of God. 
  [Offred] 
  At least this is the last time I'll have to get into that f*cking bed. 
  [gasping] 
  [panting] 
  [birds chirping] 
  [footsteps approaching] 
  [aunt Lydia] 
  Single line, please. 
  Rearrange the pillows properly. 
  Towels here. 
  Hi! 
  Hi, little one. 
  It's time to come out now. 
  [handmaids chattering excitedly] 
  [upbeat music playing] 
  [handmaids chattering continues throughout] 
  [aunt Lydia] 
  Be courageous and do not fear, for God is with you. 
  He will strengthen you, and help you. 
  He will uphold you with His righteous hand. 
  O blessed and glorious day! 
  [indistinct chatter] 
  [indistinct chatter] 
  [Rita] 
  Sitting room. 
  Thank you. 
  I will take these. 
  - Dining room. 
  - Okay. 
  [men chattering and laughing] 
  - [Commander 1] 
  Time to celebrate. 
  - [Commander 2] 
  Thank you. 
  Nice to see you. 
  Please. 
  Excuse me. 
  [Commander Putnam] 
  May we pray for success. 
  And how is your little one? 
  She has gained six and a half ounces, thank the Lord. 
  [Commander Fred] 
  Praise be. 
  Congratulations are also in order for Commander Horace, newly promoted upon his wife's pregnancy. 
  Congratulations. 
  No Handmaid for you, then? 
  No. 
  May the Lord bless all future Commanders as he has blessed us. 
  [indistinct chatter] 
  Excuse me. 
  Praise be, Waterford. 
  Welcome. 
  My Handmaid is about to reach her expiration date. 
  And she wasn't that much fun to begin with. 
  How's yours? 
  Well, she has proven fruitful. 
  [Grinnell] 
  Mmm. 
  And not bad looking, either? 
  [lighter clinking] 
  - You so deserve this. 
  - Thank you. 
  [Martha] 
  Can I help you with that? 
  [wife 1] 
  Yes. 
  [wife 2] 
  Here you are. 
  It's time. 
  [wife 3] 
  Thank you. 
  [Grace] 
  Perfect timing. 
  [wife 4] 
  You look so beautiful. 
  [wife 5] 
  God goes with you. 
  [Serena sighing] 
  - [wife 6] 
  Good. 
  - [wife 7] 
  Yes. 
  [wife 2] 
  Deep breaths. 
  Good. 
  Good. 
  [wife 1] 
  Praise be. 
  [wife] 
  Good. 
  [wife] 
  Just breathe deep. 
  [wives] 
  Praise be. 
  Good. 
  Praise be. 
  [wife 3] 
  God is here with you. 
  [wife 1] 
  You're doing so well. 
  [wives laughing] 
  [aunt Lydia] 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford. 
  [indistinct chatter] 
  [aunt Lydia] 
  False labor fools the best of us. 
  You might consider timing the contractions next time. 
  I'm sorry, Mrs. 
  Waterford. 
  [somber music playing] 
  [sighs] 
  [men chattering indistinctly] 
  [men laughing and chattering] 
  [doctor] 
  Well, cervix is closed and 0% effaced. 
  Your baby isn't coming anytime soon. 
  There were contractions. 
  [doctor] 
  Braxton-Hicks. 
  They were not productive. 
  She should be induced. 
  Today. 
  [doctor] 
  Given the severe bleeding earlier in the pregnancy, we're already looking at a high-risk birth. 
  [aunt Lydia] 
  We prefer not to introduce chemicals into the process unnecessarily. 
  However, seeing as the baby's measuring over nine pounds and the Handmaid is petite, I might consider inducing in a week or two, in order to avoid C-section. 
  [aunt Lydia] 
  Until then, we must encourage the baby to come out the natural way. 
  Vigorous walks. 
  Mango salad. 
  I know of a spicy tea that works wonders. 
  Tea. 
  How spicy is it? 
  'Cause heartburn could hurt the baby, you know. 
  [aunt Lydia] 
  We are all impatient. 
  I can promise you that this pregnancy will end soon, and Offred will be off to her next posting. 
  In a new district. 
  A change of scene. 
  [Offred] 
  You're right, Mrs. 
  Waterford. 
  It's been lovely, but I think it's probably best if we don't ever see each other again. 
  - [door closes] 
  - [exhales] 
  [tense music playing] 
  [footsteps approaching] 
  [Commander Fred] 
  It's late. 
  I know. 
  They're going to make me leave this house very soon. 
  Yes. 
  Serena wants to send me to a new district. 
  Does she? 
  A change of scene, she said. 
  [chair moving] 
  And That's not what you want? 
  You have been kind to me. 
  More than other Commanders would have been. 
  And you're going to be a father yourself soon. 
  I need your help. 
  What is it? 
  [exhales] 
  I've already lost a child, and I'm about to lose another one. 
  It would help if I could be moved to my daughter's district. 
  Please. 
  If it is at all, within your power to do that. 
  Who are you to tell me what's within my power? 
  [tense music playing] 
  I understand that it's unusual. 
  I would never approach her. 
  She would never even see me. 
  I can promise you that. 
  I've been too lenient with you. 
  Too indulgent. 
  What? 
  I've spoiled you. 
  Get out. 
  Get out! 
  I shouldn't have expected you to understand. 
  You have no idea what it is like to have a child of your own flesh and blood. 
  And you never will. 
  [rain pattering] 
  How was work? 
  Oh, it was a Challenging day. 
  All the days will be challenging until the baby arrives. 
  I think Offred was happy that the baby didn't come. 
  Do you? 
  Yes, I think she enjoyed it. 
  She has forgotten her place. 
  The doctor refuses to induce. 
  There's nothing we can do but wait for the baby to come. 
  Do you really think so? 
  I suppose there are ways a baby might come out sooner. 
  I think the best way is the most natural way. 
  [sinister music playing] 
  [Offred] 
  Listen to my voice. 
  This is your mother. 
  I love you. 
  And I always will. 
  Okay? 
  [footsteps approaching] 
  Mrs. 
  Waterford wants to see you. 
  I'll tell the baby about you. 
  [labored breathing] 
  Please come and sit. 
  [door closes] 
  We need to help the baby come out naturally. 
  No. 
  Please. 
  [Serena] 
  The natural way is the best way. 
  - It could hurt the baby. 
  - No, it's what's best for the baby. 
  Serena, listen to me. 
  You don't have to do this. 
  - Stop it, Offred. 
  - Please don't do this! 
  - Stop it! 
  - It doesn't have to be this way! 
  [Serena] 
  Offred, you need to stop it. 
  - You don't have to - Stop it. 
  Don't! 
  Please! 
  No! 
  No! 
  - Lie down! 
  - No! 
  Don't! 
  [Commander Fred] 
  And she said, "Behold my handmaid, Bilhah. 
  Go in unto her. 
  And she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her. 
  " [Offred] 
  No! 
  Stop! 
  [Commander Fred] 
  "And she gave him her handmaid to wife, and Jacob went in unto her!" [Offred] 
  Don't do this! 
  Please! 
  [Commander Fred grunting] 
  No! 
  No, please, stop! 
  Stop! 
  Stop! 
  Stop it! 
  Please, stop! 
  No, stop! 
  Serena! 
  No, please, stop! 
  Stop! 
  Stop it! 
  Stop! 
  No! 
  No! 
  Please, don't! 
  Please! 
  No! 
  [sobbing] 
  No! 
  [Offred] 
  You treat it like a job. 
  One detaches oneself [Commander Fred grunting] 
  No. 
  [Offred] 
  No more to you than a bee is to a flower. 
  Not me. 
  Not my flesh. 
  [Commander Fred moaning] 
  [Offred] 
  I'm not here. 
  [footsteps receding] 
  [door opens] 
  [door closes] 
  [footsteps receding] 
  [fireplace crackling] 
  [labored breathing] 
  [dogs barking] 
  [Rita] 
  It's such a waste. 
  My mom always made my dad take out the trash. 
  I got it. 
  [door opens] 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Stop! 
  Please forgive me, for I know not what I do. 
  I have sinned against you and God and I beg for mercy. 
  [Nick] 
  Don't worry about it. 
  [Eden] 
  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness. 
  Don't you care? 
  Why don't you care? 
  It's okay. 
  You're not in trouble. 
  You don't look at me! 
  You don't touch me unless you have to. 
  You've never kissed me, I've never been kissed until tonight! 
  I'm your wife! 
  You just caught me cheating on you! 
  You should care! 
  [liquid pouring] 
 
 
 
  It's the Handmaid. 
  Eden You like her. 
  Why do you like her? 
  You're not making any sense. 
  Just tell me! 
  Eden, I would never get involved with a Handmaid. 
  It'd be suicide. 
  [teary] 
  So, you just don't love me? 
  [sniffles] 
  Look, I'm sorry. 
  [Eden crying] 
  [sobbing] 
  Please stop crying. 
  [wailing] 
  [footsteps approaching] 
  [knocking at door and door opens] 
  [Commander Fred] 
  I've planned a surprise for you. 
  I think you'll like it. 
  [suspenseful music playing] 
  Be back in three hours before Serena notices you're gone. 
  They're expecting you. 
  You deserve this. 
  Don't let anyone else see you. 
  [tapping at glass] 
  [sinister music playing] 
  June? 
  What happened? 
  What'd he do? 
  June. 
  Talk to me. 
  Please, say something. 
  [tires squealing] 
  [engine stops] 
  [birds screeching] 
  [indistinct chatter over radio] 
  Here. 
  [indistinct chatter over radio] 
  [man] 
  Ten minutes. 
  [whispering indistinctly] 
  [Hannah] 
  She kind of looks like me. 
  [Hannah] 
  Can I see her?

  What if I turn it like this? 
  Oh, my baby.

  Did you try to find me? 
  I did. 
  I tried so hard. 
  Daddy did too. 
  Why didn't you try harder? 
  Baby, it's okay for you to be mad at me. 
  I waited for you.

  For you And to protect you.
