 Well, this is an all-time low. 
 I can't believe we lost to a public radio cooking show. 
 Hey, don't look at me. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You struck out four times and didn't catch a single ball. 
 That's why I don't want you looking at me. 
 Murph, I'm most disappointed in you. 
 Why me? I-I got five home runs and that cute shortstop's phone number. 
 I know. Didn't you hear me call dibs? 
 Oh, I thought you said "ribs." 
 Ooh, we should get ribs. 
 Oh, you know what, I can't. 
 I got a date with that cute shortstop. 
 Great news. 
 Mrs. Johnson-Peña has abdicated her position in the BTA. 
 Who's Mrs. Johnson-Peña? 
 The elderly woman who lives on nine. 
 Right. And what's the BTA? 
 The Building Tenants Association. 
 Understood. And...? 
 Abdicate means to resign. 
 Mrs. Johnson-Peña's departure leaves a vacancy, a vacancy that I plan to fill after I win the election and become... dramatic pause... the new president of the BTA! 
 Do you get paid? 
 Only in the satisfaction of helping others in the joy of seeing my portrait hanging on the Wall of Presidents. 
 So no. 
 Although the position does come with a free parking space big enough to hold my recumbent bicycle. 
 But not enough for two of them, so I guess you shouldn't buy me one. 
 Ugh, bummersville. 
 I can't believe this is happening. 
 I could actually be the next president of the Royal Arms. 
 Won't you all help me commemorate this moment by singing our building's anthem? 
 Our building has an anthem? 
 ♪ Building ♪ 
♪ Strong and full of charms ♪ 
♪ We salute thee, Royal Ar... ♪ 
 You know, what am I doing? This is crazy. 
 I should be accompanying myself on the cello. 
 We've got five seconds. 
 Go, go, go! 
 Where was this hustle on the field? 
 We were never this motivated. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yes, Mrs. Blaustein, just calling to make sure I've got your support for the BTA. 
 Yes, that thing that Frannie did. 
 Yes, splendid. 
 I won't let you down. 
 I've got Mrs. Blaustein. 
 Dani : Mmm. 
 That means you got Mr. Blaustein too. 
 She rides that man like a show pony. 
 Excellent. 
 Emily, how is it coming with the slogans? 
 Okay, I have narrowed it down to... 
 "Peace, Love and Unger-standing." 
 Word play, love it. 
 (laughs) 
 "Felix  Se puede." 
 (gasps) For the Ecuadorian family in 6-F. 
 Me gusta. 
 (chuckles) 
 And "Surr-Unger to Unger." 
 I feel like it's slipping away from us. Keep at it. 
 Bad news, Felix, someone defaced your lobby cutout. 
 They drew a graffito on my face. 
 That is the singular for graffiti. 
 And that's why I did it. 
 Oscar! 
 Felix, why are you campaigning? 
 You're running unopposed. 
 Because I need the unwavering support of the entire building if I'm going to enact my plans. 
 Oh, Felix, tell him about your idea for the laundry room. 
 Oh, yes. I would like to designate separate machines for whites and colors. 
 Now, Dani tells me that I need to present this idea carefully. 
 I think what I said was, "What the hell is wrong with you?!" 
 I also want to start a weekly coffee social so that we can build up a stronger sense of community. 
 I don't know anyone in the building, but I know they would hate that. 
 Right now, the only contact I have with some people in the building is smelling their cigarette smoke on the balcony. 
 A disgusting habit. 
 Which will be the first thing I outlaw. 
 Oscar : Wait. 
 I smoke my cigars on the balcony. 
 That's right. 
 I couldn't get you to stop as roommate, but as president, I'll have the power. 
 Felix, people don't want to hear from the board. 
 They just want to be left alone. 
 That's what I would do if I were president. 
 (guffaws) 
 What? 
 I'm just having a hard time picturing you as president. 
 You don't think I could get elected, or you don't think I could do the job? 
 Yes. 
 People would vote for me. 
 Dani? 
 I don't live here. 
 You earn your paycheck here. 
 Oscar for president. 
 Emily, what do you think? 
 Well, let's just say that I have a... 
 "Hunger for Unger." 
 Okay, you did good. Thanks. 
 You know what, the people in this building would be lucky to have someone like me just to save them from you. 
 Well, I guess we'll never know. 
 Or will we? 
 Oscar, you can't be serious. 
 On behalf of balcony smokers and people who don't give a crap, I hereby enter the race for president of the... 
 What is it again? 
 BTA. 
 Yeah, that. I'm gonna be president of that. 
 Good morning, fellow tenants. 
 Whoa. 
 I thought you were the cutout. 
 Take one of my flyers. 
 It details the 14-point plan I will enact when you elect me as your leader. 
 I liked the cutout better. 
 Yeah, I miss the mustache. 
 Oscar : Hi. You want a doughnut? 
 I'm Oscar Madison, and I'm running for president of the BLT. 
 But you've got your hands full. 
 So here we go, and here we go. 
 Wow, you really think this strategy will work, huh? 
 You think people can be swayed by free doughnuts? 
 No, they want to know where you stand on the "iss-ues." 
 People don't care about the "iss-ues." 
 They want to be left alone. 
 (mouth full): Yeah, amen to that. 
 Jelly-filled. 
 You got my vote. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (door opens, slams) 
 Red alert. 
 We've lost the Blausteins. 
 Oh no. 
 The Blausteins were our gateway to the... 
 Both : Friedmans. 
 And they vacation with the Donovans. 
 We're losing the entire 11th floor. 
 And as I always say, "As goes the 11th floor..." 
 Both : "So goes the building." 
 I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but Oscar now actually has a path to victory. 
 Okay, Felix, you are overreacting. 
 You're clearly the better candidate. 
 Yes, I know that, but try telling that to the Bilgors. 
 We lost the Bilgors? 
 I may have corrected Ted on his grammar while explaining my trash-chute initiative. 
 (groaning): Oh no, Felix. 
 "Lay" and "lie." 
 Know the difference. 
 Know the difference! 
 I can't believe that people can't see what a terrible president Oscar would be. 
 I swear, if he wins, I am moving uptown to The Canada House. 
 Well, if you think he would be that bad, why don't you make that part of your message? 
 Oh, you mean go negative. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yes. 
 Could probably find some dirt on him. 
 He's literally covered in it. 
 (laughs) 
 But n-n-no, no, despite our differences, Oscar is my best friend. 
 I want to win, but not that way. 
 You are a good man, Felix Unger. 
 And you're gonna make an amazing president. 
 And you are going to make a great First Lady. 
 Once we lock down a more appropriate campaign hairstyle. 
 You don't like my hair? 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 I do not. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Oscar :  I think the building's fine the way it is,  but my opponent wants to get in your face and change everything. 
 That little guy? 
 He's been here three times. 
 He always gives me something to read. 
 I hate reading. 
 I get it. You don't want problems when you come home. 
 You already got your wife yelling at you. 
 She's always on me. 
 And the kids. 
 I got so many kids. 
 You just want to be left alone. 
 A vote for me is a vote for peace and quiet. 
 Remember on election day, "O" for Oscar. 
 You got my vote. 
 (chuckles) 
 Running out of doughnuts. 
 How many more doors you want to knock on? 
 Just a couple more. Plus I got Murph out there talking me up to the neighbors. 
 The common man loves a celebrity. 
 Oscar, what's come over you? 
 Why do you care so much about this president thing? 
 Because Felix would make everyone's life a living hell. 
 And because... 
 I don't know, he said I couldn't do it. 
 Ooh, we just struck emotional oil. 
 Let it flow, big guy. 
 He's always rolling his eyes at me, saying I don't get things, that I'm an incompetent boob, that I can't use my tie as a belt. 
 But he says it with love. 
 Well, I'm sick of it, and I'm gonna make him eat his words. 
 Oh, hey guys. 
 Murph, what are you doing here? 
 Hey, you coming back to bed? 
 You bet. 
 (chuckles) 
 This is the guy I was telling you about. 
 Oh, um, he was very persuasive. 
 Yeah, I gave her an "O" for Oscar. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 
 
 
 And that is why I say, "I.D. cards, an i-dea whose time has come." 
 In conclusion... there is no candidate who more deserves a place on our esteemed Wall of Presidents than me, because only I have the courage and the vision to lead the Royal Arms into the 22nd century. 
 So when it comes time to vote, please remember my platform with this simple mnemonic device: Together Our Community Can't Help But Go Insane And Bananas For President Felix Hooray. 
 Thank you. 
 (whoops) 
 (whoops) 
 (whoops weakly) 
 Thank you, Felix. 
 Okay, our older residents might want to stand to eliminate any blood clots that might have formed during that very thorough presentation. 
 Up next is the other male roommate, no judgment, Oscar Madison. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 If you elect me, I will leave you alone. 
 And you can remember that by my mnemonic device: I Will Leave You Alone. 
 This guy gets it. 
 I feel like I'm losing them. 
 Well, what can you do? 
 You've already said everything that you can say. 
 Maybe not everything. 
 Um, excuse me. 
 Uh, neighbors, fellow tenants, I would be remiss if I did not say one more thing. 
 (groaning) 
 Oscar is my best friend, as well as my roommate, and as his roommate, no one knows him better than I do. 
 Which is why I mean it when I say... you do  not  want this man as your president. 
 What's this, now? 
 He is fiscally irresponsible, his retirement plan is selling off unopened Batman trading cards, he befouls the air with his cigar smoke,  and  most damningly, it was Oscar who vomited in the lobby ficus. 
 Oscar, would you like to address these allegations? 
 Thank you, Felix. Okay, here's the deal. 
 Every single thing Felix said is true. 
 So I'm bad with money, but who here in this room hasn't been late paying a bill? 
 And I'm not the only who enjoys a relaxing smoke on the balcony. 
 Right, Mr. Blaustein? 
 Just don't tell Mrs. Blaustein. 
 And I'll admit it, I'm the ficus barfer. 
 I drank too much and got sick. But who here hasn't? 
 At the critical moment I had a choice, floor or ficus, and I went ficus. 
 And you know what? I'd do it again! 
 So what do you say? Who's gonna vote for me? 
 Oscar, Oscar, Oscar... 
 Others (chanting) : Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! 
 No! No! No! (whistles) 
 No, that was not... that was not a chant, that was a chide! 
 It was a chide! 
 (others continue chanting "Oscar!") 
 How do I look? Do I look presidential? 
 Uh... I don't know. 
 I feel like you're missing something. 
 I'm only doing this to see the look on Felix's face when he spots me on the Wall of Presidents. 
 You want a sneak peek? 
 Turn around. 
 Good morning, constituent. 
 Hello, Oscar. 
 Please address me by my full title: Mr. President. 
 Or, as my security detail calls me... 
 "Renegade." 
 I told you I'm not calling you that. 
 What? 
 We can have a code name, too. 
 Okay, then I'll be "Coffee Break." See ya. 
 So, what should I do on my first day as president? 
 Well, not my place to say, but if  I  were president... 
 Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha... 
 I get it. 
 Because you laughed when I... 
 I said I get it! 
 I know what I should do... I should move my car to my sweet new presidential parking space. 
 Renegade on the move. 
 Secure the perimeter. Renegade is wheels up. 
 Teddy, stop that. 
 Madame Butterfly is not amused. 
 Oh, hey, Oscar. Congratulations. 
 Oh, thanks... neighbor. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 You don't know my name. 
 I love it! 
 (laughs) 
 Oh, hey, while I got you here... 
 I lost 75 cents in the vending machine... do I got to fill out a form, or can you reimburse me now? 
 And another thing... how are we supposed to wipe down the gym equipment if the building doesn't give us clean towels? 
 You ever see the sweaty guy in 8G? 
 He turned the treadmill into a freaking Slip 'N Slide. 
 Okay, let me see if I've got this straight. 
 Clean towels, didn't get your candy bar, possible ghost. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Oh, my good God. 
 And could you talk to your friend for me? 
 He promised he'd call, but he never did. 
 Look, I know Murph... he's not gonna... 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Oh, my God, they won't stop. 
 Mr. Kim wants a different mailbox. 
 Mrs. Markham thinks there's a ghost in her pantry. 
 Oh, Admiral Pennington. 
 Yeah, he was murdered by a prostitute. 
 Thank God I get to take a break. 
 Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure about that. 
 E-mails, faxes, invoice for my overtime. 
 You didn't think I was campaigning for free, did you? 
 I don't know how to handle this stuff. 
 Then don't. Wasn't your campaign about doing nothing? 
 Yeah, sure, they don't want me bothering  them,  but they sure as hell want to bother  me. 
 Mm. 
 Hey, Dani. 
 Oh, no, I'm not the president. Mm-mm. 
 I'm the secretary of See You Monday. 
 It's Thursday. 
 I know. 
 Nope. 
 No way. 
 Forget it. 
 No, you can't get a tiger. 
 Oscar... you're making a mess. What are those? 
 Just a bunch of stupid requests from the tenants. 
 Well, this one is important. 
 You need to pick a caterer for Frannie's last meeting. 
 Who cares? We'll just get one of those six-foot subs. 
 Oh, yes, because nothing says "farewell, Frannie" like two yards of bologna. 
 You know what? I'll handle it. In fact, give me all those. 
 Don't mistake this for me stopping you, but... why are you helping me? 
 Because I will not be part of this magnificent building's decline. 
 And... because I feel terrible about those things that I said. 
 You are my friend, and that was uncalled for. 
 Oh, hey, it was all true. 
 I was surprised you didn't bring up my role in the garbage chute fire. 
 I thought I would steer clear of possible felonies. 
 Anyway... sorry I said so many mean things. 
 I guess I just felt the election slipping away from me, and it brought back a lot of bad memories, so... 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, when I was in school, I would always run for office because I thought I had so many good ideas. 
 And then I always lost to the cool kid, the... 
 Homecoming Queen, the quarterback. 
 I don't know, it's stupid. 
 I... I thought that was all behind me and I had a chance to show what I could really do. 
 I'm sorry, Felix, I didn't know. 
 Well, it's okay. 
 If you can't be one of the popular kids, maybe it's best to work... behind the scenes, huh? 
 Like when I was co-holder of the AV Club closet key. 
 You know what? I will start calling some caterers. 
 Hey, Felix? 
 You forgot these. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Frannie :  Oscar. 
 Thank you for getting these hors d'oeuvres for my last BTA meeting. 
 Where'd they come from? 
 I assume you're looking for an answer more specific than "that tray from that table over there"? 
 (chuckles): He's kidding, of course. 
 Oscar found a wonderful new caterer. 
 These little fried bastards are great. Mm! 
 Well, I figured if my face is gonna be up there on that wall, I better earn it. 
 Rearranging the lobby furniture to make foot traffic more efficient? 
 Who thinks of  that? 
 I know. You would not think that would be me, would you? 
 I feel bad taking credit for all the stuff you did. 
 Nonsense. It's a pleasure to serve. 
 (gavel bangs) 
 Frannie : Okay, everyone, let's get started. 
 It is my pleasure... to turn over the presidential gavel to someone who's already done so much for our building... 
 Oscar Madison. 
 (whooping) 
 Thank you. 
 No. Stop. Really. Stop. 
 I love you, man! 
 Getting weird, Wayne. 
 Okay, for my first official... docket to the decree... of the agenda... 
 I would just like to say that... you all made a horrible mistake electing me. 
 I didn't do any of the stuff you're thanking me for. 
 Felix did. 
 Oscar, you don't have to do this. 
 No, I want to. 
 I don't deserve this hammer. 
 I may or may not have started the garbage chute fire. 
 And I may or may not have tried to put it out with vodka. 
 I don't deserve to be president. 
 Felix does. 
 But we don't want him. 
 He reminds me of my wife. 
 I know you don't want to elect Felix 'cause he's a nerd. 
 It's a normal human reaction. I get it. 
 But he's what this place needs. 
 Trust me, he'll grow on you. 
 He grew on me. 
 Well, he makes me uncomfortable. 
 But if Oscar says he's okay, there must be something to him. 
 He's gonna do a great job. 
 Go get 'em, buddy. 
 That's a big man, giving up power like that. 
 (chanting): Oscar! Oscar! 
 (others join in): Oscar! Oscar! 
 (chanting continues) 
 Hey. Are you okay? 
 Well, this is not how I wanted to win. 
 But who cares? I'm president! President! 
 All right, people, the Unger Era begins right now... let's get to work. 
 Listen up! People! 
 I'm gonna need a bigger gavel. 
 Now, come on, Felix, I don't need a stupid I.D. 
 I've been coming to this building for years. 
 Everybody knows who I... 
 Smile. 
 (shutter clicks) 
 Okay. I'm ready. 
 You sure you don't want another go at those bangs? 
 I've got a hairbrush here somewhere. 
 You are lucky that you're good in b... 
 (shutter clicks) 
 Do we have to do this today? I'm hungover. 
 Haven't slept, haven't showered... 
 Smile. 
 (shutter clicks) 
 Dani, what are you doing? Turn around. 
 Hey, you're a professional photographer. 
 I'm gonna use this for my dating profile. 
 Count me down. 
 Three, two, one. 
 (shutter clicks) 
 Oscar, take it off. 
 I'm not Oscar. 
 I'm Batman. 
 Come on, now, take this seriously. 
 I take everything seriously. 
 I'm Batman.
