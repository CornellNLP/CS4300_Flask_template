 Previously on  Constantine... 
 I always took you for a...  a voodoo priest with a... flair for the dramatic. 
 I do what's needed. 
 Woman :  They are back. 
 La Brujeria. The rising darkness. The  Brujeria are behind it. Jim Corrigan, NOLA PD Homicide. And you are...? Here to help you, Jimmy boy. (kisses) I'd like you to get on  your hotline to hell. Find out about this rising darkness. Sister... (eerie whispering) A darkness is coming, heralded by someone close to you. Someone who will betray you. (door creaks) Man : That's it... rise up now. I need your help. It's my wedding night. Look at my sweet babies. Oh, yeah... (animals chittering, chirping) (owl hooting) You're gonna die, child. You're gonna...  die. Girl : Hey! (gasps) Leave her alone. You all right? I'm fine. I... I just.. There's nothing be scared of, is there? No. (exhales) I don't know why. Why are you out here so late... all alone? Are you lonely? I snuck out of the house. Me and my mama was arguing again. How come y'all are out so late? He lets us do whatever we want. Who does? The Man. We're married to him. All of us. I always dreamed of getting married. I even stole my mama's wedding ring. Girl : Would you... like a wedding ring now? Your very own wedding ring? (laughs softly): I guess. Can I see yours? Aren't they beautiful? Does it hurt? Only at first, but after... you don't feel a thing. You know, if you're married to The Man, you'd never be alone again. We'd be a family. All of us. You want to marry The Man? Yes. Please. Come on. We'll take you home with us. You're gonna make a beautiful bride. (girls laughing) The man : That's my good girls. (vehicle approaching) (brakes squeak) (car door opens) (door closes) (knocks on window) (window squeaking) Picked a hell of a night to be sitting out here in your truck, mister. Ain't nowhere to go. My truck's broke. Flat battery. Well, I reckon you're lucky I come along. Go ahead and pop that hood. I'll get my jumper cables, and we'll have you on your way in no time. Cool. That's kind, kind of you. Merci beaucoup. You all right, mister? I found these here. Okay. Well... they ought to do. Yes, they ought to. (choking) (indistinct chatter, music in distance) Constantine :  You were wise to call me in, Detective Corrigan. Spontaneous desiccation. Now,  that  is not something you see every day. Your mate here... he was mummified. Dupree, John. His name... was Clement Dupree. Right. And you believe Detective Dupree was murdered because of a case he was working. Missing Persons. Three girls, same age. Dupree believed they were abducted, had this theory about... Blood moons? The lunar tetrad. Four successive lunar eclipses six months apart. The last in the cycle is tonight. The blood moon. Dupree was killed the same night the third girl got took. What is this? Looks like the killer had some fun with a branding iron. I'd best see the body. (man whimpering in distance) This a nice, nice home you got here, partner, for sure! (sobbing): Please... let me go... Jamais d'la vie! You a hunter! I like to hunt. Mais  you ought to knowed that. (sobbing): Please... Why are you doing this? Don't make so much noise over there, you hear me? (man continues sobbing quietly) You made me miss my own weddin' night. That's all right. See, we gonna make a nice, nice weddin' gift. How that sound, partner? (sizzling) (sobbing): No, no... no! No! Please! (strained grunt) Good to see you again, Zed. Been so long, I almost didn't think you were real. Glad I didn't dream you up. Constantine : Oh, this is... this is beautiful. Lovely. Really, really nice. But hows about a bit of a hand over here, eh, big man? Yeah. I got this. (whoosh) All right, one, two, three... (grunting) Yeah. (grunts) You got it? Yeah, I got it, yeah. Oh! (clothes ripping) Constantine : There you go. Corrigan : What's that? Constantine : Holy water. Good for revealing ritual markings. What's it tell us? Detective Dupree got the business end of  Diaboli Cauter...  the Devil's branding irons. Used in the 13th century inquisition to torture witches. The girls were taken by a satanist. Why? What does he want them for? A full moon symbolizes rebirth, but the blood moon... (phone ringing) (sighs) most likely sacrifices to usher in the new cycle. The station. I need to take this. Corrigan. Talk to me. Are you all right, luv? (deep grunt) John! It's me, Gary. Gary? Listen. (soft crackling) Gary Bloody Lester! Are you hijacking corpses now, eh? How are you, mate? I had to warn you. I'm all ears, Gaz. There's a price on your head. Big bounty on offer. I'm sorry, mate. Dwayne :  I... I didn't mean it, Papa. I only wanted to scare her. On my life. What about  her  life? You murdered the mother of your children. A bounty is being offered for John Constantine. The man is a con artist, but not without some skill. To collect this bounty, I require something... special. If you agree to assist... (trembling): Whatever it takes... I'll do it. (bird cawing) (men shouting indistinctly) A life for a life. (screaming) (flesh tearing) (panting) Come in. When I called Missing Persons, they said it might be a while before anyone came... But here y'all are. Mrs. Whitney... Anna Kate. Just Anna Kate, please. I can't hear that other name no more. Your married name? My ex-husband's the reason why Vesta's gone now. She loved him to pieces. Don't rightly know why. 'Cause he ain't never paid her no mind. Well, almost all girls love their fathers. No matter what they do. (flies buzzing) (coughs) (coughing) (gasps) Amberly : Look at you. Prettier than butter melting on a stack of wheat cakes. I don't know where I am. I can't remember when I got here. Sometimes when I wake up, I can't tell if it's real or a dream. You were so tired when we got back. You never even told us your name. Vesta. It's Vesta Whitney. What a pretty name. Amberly : Why don't you come along now, Vesta. (chuckles softly) Constantine : Any visions? Nothing. I'm not getting anything. There's no need to force it, luv. Take a break, we'll roll the dice again later. Maybe I'm not as comfortable gambling as you seem to be. Is there something on your mind, luv? Are you going to roll the dice on Gary's warning, too? Just wait and see what turns up? Yeah. Sounds reasonable. You can't ignore the warnings, John. Oh, every time I light up, I have the surgeon general harping on about bloody lung cancer, and look at me... fit as a fiddle. What's your point? My point is we can all shape our destiny, but none of us get to escape our fate. So when my time's up, that's it. Now, what is really going on here, Zed? What are you hiding? I saw Jim dead. In my vision. (knocks) CORRIGAN: Hey. Think I got all I could from Anna Kate. What about here? Turn anything up? Any, um... Visions. Right. No. Visions are out of service until further notice. It's the darnedest thing. I knowed I came in here for something, but for the life of me, I can't remember why. Happens to me all the time. Just keep looking. I'm sure you'll find whatever you need. (quiet whoosh) Sound advice. Manny. What are you doing here? John says you never come when he calls. He doesn't ask as nicely as you. But I didn't call for you. Are you sure? Zed, you communicate on a different level than most mortals... more like a spiritual being. You felt my need. That's what called to you. It's part of your gift. But you look like you're under the weight of a curse at the moment. I... I had a vision of a friend. He's going to die. I don't know if I can change that, but I can at least warn him. I just don't know if I should. I envy you. Truly. You know, it's not all harps and halos for us; we have rules to follow. But you, you have choices. You can act on your visions if you choose to. Now, that's a gift. Tell me something, Zed Martin. You like pickles? I love pickles. (quiet whoosh) (laughs): Of course. Pickles. How'd you know? It's a gift, apparently. All right, all right, all right. You mind telling me what you're doing? Eh, little bit of your job, and, uh, little bit of hers. You, uh, don't happen to have a taser, do you? Mm-mm. Right. Uh... Ah, this should do it. (speaking Tibetan) Ah... John! (grunting loudly) (electricity crackling) John! Hey! Hey! Crazy! You're gonna kill yourself! (sighs) (groans, gags) (sighs) If there was any other way, luv, I would've tried it, trust me, but, uh, desperate times and all. What did you do? Tibetans call it piercing the veil. DNA, the right words, a dash of cardiac arrest, and it gets you into the bardo state. Allows you to connect with the subject's spirit. And? What'd you see? I saw through her eyes. She went outside, down the street, and then... I know where she was taken from. The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married. Ain't it beautiful? It's real pretty. You wore it when you got married? We all done. My mama's wedding gown is... My mama... she don't know where I'm at. When you're married to The Man, you don't have to worry about nobody. Won't she be worried? She'll be proud of you, becoming a woman and all. Maybe she could come. Might make her real happy. We'd just have to do something about the smell, is all. I'm... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I didn't mean to offend you. It don't matter. Besides, you won't even notice it once you're married. I promise. (chuckles softly) 
 
 (bird cawing) (growling) Rete! You took a life; you paid for it with your own. But now the Loa has seen fit to give you another. (growling) Don't waste it. Consider this dust the essence of Constantine's life. Breathe it in. Connect to his energy. You exist now for one purpose only... Reduce John Constantine's life to dust. No sign of anyone. Car looks like it could've been here all night. Maybe the driver saw something he wasn't meant to. Hey. Everything okay with you? I mean, these kind of cases, they can be rough. I'm fine. All right. Just... Just know that you can talk to me. About anything. You remember how to do that, right? Yeah. Talk to me? 'Cause right now, seems like you can't even look at me. Zed? Maybe we should catch up with John. ♪ (growling) (grunting) Papa Midnite's voice : Constantine, look into those dead eyes before you. I want you to understand killing you brings me no real joy. However, we do what we must! (grunts) (Papa Midnite grunts) (growling) (groans) (wheezing exhale) Give me a hand, will you? The hell was that? (grunts) (panting) It's a voodoo zombie. Looks like Papa Midnite has decided to try and collect the bounty; and he'll be back. No more pissing about; we need to find that girl, fast. I need you to push past any distractions you might have. You need a vision. Do it. I'll try. (clears throat) Zed :  I see blood. Constantine :  Widen your lens. We need an address. (groaning quietly) (gasps) There-there was, there was a man and he was trying to tell me something. I need, uh, something to write. A pen and paper. Here we go. We have an address. Constantine : Oh, yes, we do. All right, let's go. (crow cawing) E kere eke nke Age. M iwu gi! Be my eyes. Find John Constantine. Your visions... They always come true? Not as simple as that, Jimbo. Sometimes they're abstract; they need to be interpreted. I just mean, have they ever failed? Never. Are you ready? You sure look purty. The Man's waiting for you. (crow cawing) ♪ (thud) ♪ Zed :  Dios mio. Constantine : I'm guessing this is our missing security guard. We're too late for him. We wasted valuable time. Not wasted. He deserved to be found as well. And I think it might have given us our first real breakthrough. I know this area. Only one way in and out. Traffic cam records it all. (crow caws) You two need to leave here right now. There's trouble brewing here and I can't risk it following us. What kind of trouble? The bounty hunter kind. Go, now. I'll sort this and call you later. You don't even have a phone. Constantine : Just go. Now. Keep her safe. (cawing) (truck drives up) (truck door opens) (truck door shuts) Oh, yeah... You might be the prettiest  peeshwank  I ever done see. What your name is, boo? Vesta. Vesta. I like that. J'ain gros couer,  Vesta. What does that mean? This here... a right big heart. I feel like cryin'. You gonna marry me? Stay forever? Yes. C'est magnifique. Come now, Vesta. (crow cawing) You finally did it. You traded your last thread of honor... (shaky breath) For a lousy, bloody bounty. Your next words will be your last, Constantine. Choose them wisely. There's a girl out there with a depraved killer. I'm her only chance of rescue. Can any bounty... be worth that stain on your soul? I gave up on my soul a long time ago. I'm sorry for the girl, but yes, the bounty is worth it. Your sacrifice will free my sister's soul from eternal damnation. A life for a life. No one has that kind of power. Except the  Brujeria. It seems you have angered them, John. Not your smartest move. Apparently not. If not me, someone else would've collected. Who would dare deny them? I don't suppose, uh... I can tempt you with a counter... (gunshot) You're not the only one that can reanimate a corpse. I just added a glamour spell. Nifty, eh? You'd better kill me, Constantine. Oh, shut it. Ta for that. (phone rings) Hello? Constantine : Hey, all sorted. How about you... you got an address? Jim checked the traffic cameras. They got a hit. A guy killed his wife six years ago on their wedding night. He claimed Satan told him to do it because, apparently, she wasn't the virgin bride he deserved. Well, that sounds like our man. Text the address to this phone. I'll meet you there. Protector of the damned, we ask you to bless this union between you servant and his bride. Time for the devil's benediction. Kneel down. I don't want to do this. Don't make the misere. Kneel down, now. Come on. That's it. It's time to get you wedding ring. No! Aw, now. Aw, come on, now, why you gonna do that? Help me! Someone help! Please, someone! ♪ (creaking) (grunts) (creaking) (insects buzzing) (grunts) (groans, grunts) Bloody hell. Reckon I could do this all night, boo! Ain't got a lick of quit in me! (shuddering breaths) (gasps) Damn it, John. Nearly got your head blown clean off. Zed : You okay? Hey, hey, hey. Mine's bigger. Corrigan : House is clear. Let's search the grounds. (screams) No! No. Please. Oh, I knowed I'd find you! (panting) You mine now. Forever. Until death do us part. (whimpering) I promise you that. Come on. We're going home. (thump) Let her go. (moaning softly) Hello. (Zed grunts) (grunting) We got him. Hey, hey. We got him. We got him. You okay, sweetie? Come on. (grunts) (handcuffs clicking) Tell me. What would happen if a man like this, after everything he's done, all the children he's... murdered, what would happen if he were to... try and run away? He ain't no demon, ain't no ghost. He's a man. A man? Is he, Jim? (handcuffs clicking) (panting) (gun clicks) Run. (panting) (gunshot) Hey, hey. Hey. Come on. Let's go. (speaking foreign language) (creaking) (groans) (indistinct police transmission) ♪ Boys working on empty ♪ Do you believe in fate? (chuckles) I don't know. I guess I just... think what's meant to be will be. I saw you dead. You asked me before if my visions always come true. And I saw you dead. That's why you couldn't look at me. I didn't know if I should tell you. Who wants the burden of that knowledge? What made you change your mind? I realized you deserve to know. It was my responsibility to tell you. I don't know when it's going to happen, where. I don't even know if there's anything we can do to change it. I'm really sorry, Jim. If I'm gonna die... I'm gonna make every moment count. ♪ But I swear I thought ♪ 
♪ I dreamed her ♪ 
♪ She never asked me once about the wrong I did ♪ 
♪ When my time comes around ♪ 
♪ Lay me gently in the cold dark earth ♪ 
♪ No grave can hold my body down ♪ 
♪ I'll crawl home to her ♪ (grunts) (zipper unzips) (whoosh) Be an angel. Come over here and hold it for me, will you? You know, you're like a blister. You only turn up when the hard work's done. I've been around. You spent time with Zed today, didn't you? Oh, I feel betrayed. I didn't realize we were seeing other people now. Oh. Come on, John. You and I both know she is not other people. You're right. Seems we're not the only ones who think that. Jim Corrigan. You're jealous. You know, I've learned to handle it when people around me die. I've had plenty of practice. Let's just hope that she's strong enough. That's not what's really troubling you though, is it? I stare into the face of evil every bloody day. It usually manifests itself as a demon, a malevolent spirit, a bloody zombie, but now... John, you've encountered human evil before. I have, but this is something else entirely. We now know what happens when the rising darkness meets the worst of humanity. There's not an evil in any realm more bloody dangerous than that. This thing that we've set out to do, you and I, it's working. We can win this war. Trust me. Huh. Of course we can. You know me. I don't play if I can't win. All I'm worried about is how to spend the rest of my days after I've driven every last b*st*rd demon back to where it belongs. Papa Midnite : Where's my lawyer? I told you, I'm not saying anything until I see my lawyer. What is this? Who is it? Who's there? Reveal yourself. (whoosh) Manny : You're in no position to be making demands. Who... who are you? Your savior. So that's it? I'm free now? What's the catch? You'll never be free. You gave up any hope of that when you went to work for the  Brujeria. What do you want? I'm cancelling the contract on John Constantine. You understand? He's off-limits. You work for the  Brujeria? No. The  Brujeria  work for me.
