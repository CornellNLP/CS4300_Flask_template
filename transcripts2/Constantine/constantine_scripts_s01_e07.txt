 (Birds chirping) 
 (Rattling) 
 (Rattling) 
 What you got there? 
 Rattlesnakes. 
 Careful... The venom hasn't been milked from those yet. 
 Just use one of those copperheads from back there for the sermon tonight. 
 Daddy used the poisonous ones... 
 And we're gonna honor his life by doing things the way he did 'em. 
 Want to die the way he did, too? it's about your sermon, Zach, your message. 
 They don't know what kind of snakes you're using up there. 
 They don't care. 
 Do you know how disappointed daddy would be if he knew how our numbers had dwindled? 
 These people need something to believe in. 
 Zach :  "But now that you have 
 "been set free from sin, and have become..." 
 Uh, let's see. 
 "...you've become slaves of God." 
 (Coughs) 
 Zach : I'm sorry. 
 My daddy... He... 
 He had a way of bringing this old book to life, didn't he? 
 You know what he used to say to me as a boy? 
 "There is death in that box." 
 And today... 
 I will not run from death, for God has anointed me to handle these deadly creatures. 
 (Organ playing) 
 Zach : In... This... 
 Venomous serpent, I hold, glory to God, death in my hands! 
 This serpent... 
 It cannot conquer me. 
 Woman : Sir. 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh. No way. 
 And his plan is perfect. 
 (Snake hisses) 
 (People gasping) 
 (Crying): Zach... Oh, no, no, no. 
 Are you all r... 
 Somebody call for help! 
 (Distorted, echoing): Zach, you stay with me, okay? 
 Don't you... 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (Sobbing): Oh, God... 
 (Sharp inhale) 
 (People gasping) 
 (Panting): I saw it. 
 Man : Praise the lord. 
 I saw it. 
 Praise Jesus, I saw it! 
 Man : Let me feel the spirit, preacher! 
 (Panting) 
 Let me feel the spirit. Please. 
 (Panting) 
 (Gasping) 
 (Crutches clatter to floor) 
 Oh, my leg! It's back! 
 I'm healed! Praise the lord! 
 Praise the lord! I'm healed! 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
 (Laughs): My leg! 
 (Woman speaks indistinctly) 
 Getting there. 
 Nice work. 
 Thanks. 
 (Rattling) 
 (Screams) 
 Are you all right? 
 (Zed panting) 
 Yes. 
 Sorry. 
 On that spirited note, everyone, um, take 15. 
 (Panting) 
 Hope it wasn't me. 
 Huh? 
 No. No, um... 
 You were fine. 
 (Laughs): You were more than fine. 
 15 minutes... That should be time for a cup of coffee. 
 I saw a machine downstairs. 
 I'm Eddie. 
 Um, Zed. 
 I'm sorry, I... I... I have to go. 
 Oh, okay. Um... What about dinner? 
 You know what? I... really, I don't... 
 Eat? 
 Uh... 
 Giancarlo's. 
 Thursday, 7:00 P.M. 
 Okay. 
 (Laughs) 
 Zed :  John, I just had this insane vision. 
 Oh, how are you, John? 
 I didn't have to touch anything to have the vision. 
 Well, actually, I have a little bit of a bad neck And I swore it was real. 
 I slept a bit awkward last night... 
 I mean, I saw these snakes crawling up my leg, and one of those snakes actually went up and bit my leg. 
 What, you said snakes? 
 Yeah. 
 Our training is expanding your psychic awareness. 
 You see there? 
 What, Kentucky? 
 Middle of bugger all. 
 Seems a preacher was bit by a poisonous snake, which explains your vision. 
 He came back to life, started performing miracles, and now... 
 He's a bloody star. 
 This is from a conspiracy web site. 
 Nabbed this bad boy off the grim reaper himself. it says that he regrew a man's leg. 
 (Laughs): Yeah, I saw lots of these cons growing up. Oh, yeah, and, uh, where was that exactly? 
 Uh-uh. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, I must have protection. 
 Of various kinds. 
 We're gonna go visit a preacher in a church? 
 That's a good point. 
 So, Chas is off duty. 
 He's making good with his daughter. 
 Guess what that means. 
 You're driving. 
 Grab my coat, will you? 
 Zach :  In my name shall they cast out. 
 They shall... 
 Lay hands on the sick, and they shall... Excuse me, luv. Many of you have traveled a great distance to be here this... Beautiful Sunday morning the lord has gifted us! We done with the boring part yet? Zach : And I know... This is the part y'all been waiting for. (Shouting) Your faith has been rewarded. God has come to grace us, and today you shall witness his power. And let me tell you, it is great! Can you feel it? (Shouting, whooping) Man : I can feel the power of God! I invite you to be healed. (Gasps) (Crying): I can s-see. (People shouting) This is just ridiculous. You brought me here for this? You brought  me  here... your vision, if I recall correctly. They're all so hungry for something to believe in. He's just preying on them. Yeah, well, suckers make easy prey. They're not suckers. They're just not jaded like you. They're still searching for the magic in their lives. Didn't take you for a religious one. I don't know what I am... But I like to believe there's a... guiding hand in it all. Guiding... judging... Damning. He's a jack of all trades, really. I mean, I'm not critiquing or anything, but I'm pretty sure he's not very keen on me. (Crowd chattering, whooping) In his name... I heal you. (Crowd cheering, shouting) Still think we came to the wrong place? (Chanting in foreign language) (Crowd chattering, whooping) (Continues chanting in foreign language) That's Enochian. The language of the bloody angels. Angels... They really exist? Unfortunately, yes. I don't speak their lingo, but I recognize the sound. Have you met one? Let's just table the angel talk, luv. it's the preacher we need to focus on here. Nobody wields that kind of power without consequences. Man : I got to tell you, doc, it happened right before my eyes. (Chuckles) Remarkable. it's getting kind of hot in here. Yeah, we're almost done, Nate. Briarwood Med sent me your, uh, scans from two years ago. Uh, they'd rushed you into their ER as a result of, what was it? A trucking accident. Trucking accident. Your leg was crushed, nerves severed. And then look at today's scans. The bone has regenerated, the skin, the tissue, everything. if I hadn't seen all your other scans, I'd swear you were a different man. All right. All right, and just look into my left ear. Now, open your eyes for me. Nate. (Screaming) (Snarls) Here. "Commerce at God's door." Makes me feel all bright and shiny. Oh, I just love your accent. You're not from around here. Sharp tack, you are, luv. Liverpool, England. But, uh, I'm well traveled. Yeah, we drove in from, uh, Tennessee about a week and a half ago. Uh, preacher Zachary, he cleared Nancy's chronic arthritis with just a touch. Pain-free. Are you going down to the river tomorrow? There's a group Baptism. Well, I tell you what, I fancy a dip right now. What's your name, darling? Zed. Give me your hands. You have doubt. Inside. I have a good reason to doubt. But you want to believe. I can see that. May God bless your soul. Oh, no, I've, uh... Got a bit of a cold, actually. Wouldn't want to make you sick. But thanks, anyway. What can I do for you? Just a quick question. Where did you learn the Enochian you spoke? Pardon me? Enochian. It's the language of the angels. You spoke it in your sermon this morning. Who are we to question the gifts we receive from the Lord? God bless your soul. (Snarls) (Siren chirps) (Indistinct radio transmission) (Grunts) Aah! (Screams) (Scream fades) (Growls) I could feel him, John. He was so close to death. I felt what he felt in that moment. An angel. So you said. Thanks, mate. Just about the only thing around here that isn't deep fried. So you get any other sense of Zachary the great and powerful? Well, he has good intentions and he's unquestioning in his faith. Bit boring, but okay. Let's say he's not the dark part of this equation. Unless he's being manipulated. Blind faith can be a dangerous thing. (Soft chuckle) Spoken from experience? Maybe what the preacher's doing is legitimate. From what I read, Briarwood went through a pretty rough drought this past year. Everyone's trying to make ends meet. Maybe these people get to have their miracles. Well, miracles are ours to make, luv. And your visions are connected to the scry map, remember? Scry map bad. But his heart is in the right place. Well, I can't speak to that, but I can speak to his magic. it's much too powerful. All this healing energy... it has to come from somewhere. if history's any indication, then it'll be taking its toll on the land already. On the land? Follow me. I thought I smelled something. (Sighs)  Pobrecitos. What's happening in the church is a front for something dark, something poisonous. And we need to find out what before that poison spreads. Manny. Manny. Who's Manny? He's an angel. So you do know one. Can I meet him? No, no, you wipe that look of wonder off your face. This one isn't as awe-inspiring as the title suggests. Are you kidding me? With all the darkness and all the scary stuff in the world of John Constantine, finally there's something light? Manny! Maybe if you asked nicer. (Short laugh) (People clamoring) (Coughs) Do you see all those people out there? We're gonna need to build a bigger church. Yeah, it's amazing. I hear there's one family come all the way from Poughkeepsie. You... you think maybe we ought to slow down a little? Just try to... Figure out exactly what we got on our hands? it's not our place to question the gift. Where's my pen? I got a sermon to write. it's just... we don't know where it comes from. Sarah, I almost died. But I didn't. God wants this. And he's using me to do it. Or maybe it's daddy shining down on us from heaven. Whatever the case, our path is clear. (Quiet, rattling cough) All right, you w*nk*r. You won't come the easy way... I am bringing out the big guns. You're going to lure an angel with drugs? it's dried myrtle, luv. By the divine power that holds the balance, bring forth your servant of ministering. By your wisdom and your justice, your will be done. Please. That was a nice touch. Won't make the slightest bit of difference, luv. On the contrary, the girl's right... Courtesy counts. What, you want to hear me beg, is that it? Reminds me of an ex-girlfriend of mine. I do have other mortals to watch over, John. I don't want you to watch, I want you to listen. There's a preacher in town... He's using some pretty powerful magic. So I can see. He's speaking in Enochian tongues. I need to know what he's saying. it would only make sense if you stand facing the sun. (Laughs) You just... love a good riddle, don't you? Look, I'm a foot past the line, John. You know I cannot sway the outcome of events. All right. While I face the sun. Then what? What good is it really gonna... oh. Bollocks. Not much of a guardian angel if he's not here when you want him, huh? No, he got his point across. Come here. Do me a favor, luv. Hum that tune you heard today. The Enochian. What for? Just... humor me. (Hums) (Humming) (Same melody echoes in distance) Do you hear that? Yeah. Echolocation. (Melody continues) It's getting louder. (Mutters) There. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy. Careful, careful. Ay, dios mío. It looks abandoned. We should be safe here for now. Over there. Here, take her. Yeah, yeah. Here you are, luv. She's an actual angel. is this the one you know? No, this one's a lot prettier. I'm Imogen. What happened to you, luv? I was taking a dying mortal to heaven. I don't know how, but... He pulled a feather from my wing. He was revived. I fell to earth. That must be what I saw in my vision when I touched Zachary. it's the only way an angel can enter our plane in physical form. Damage to the wings. One feather. Piss poor design, if you ask me. That's what Zachary has. An angel's feather. Piqued your interest now, have we? Who are you talking to? The ugly one. Zed  (laughing): Where is he? Are you okay? I don't know. Everything hurts. You could've helped me find her faster, you know. Is he over here? I didn't know she fell, John. Angels are compartmentalized. All part of the plan to prevent our interference, keep humanity's free will intact. A little to your right, luv. Are riddles and... Minimally helpful guidance also part of the plan? A mortal has never been able to remove an angel's feather before. Imogen doesn't belong here. She won't last. Ask him if an angel can die. Yes. The soul is extinguished. We simply cease to exist. We need to get that feather back. What is this? Protection spell. Once I'm done, evil will not be able to cross the line created by the flowing water. Should keep Imogen safe while we get the feather back from Zachary. I should stay. She's gonna be alone. Constantine : She's not alone, luv. Manny. How come I can't see him? He's in spirit form. He reveals himself to me, principally to annoy me, I'm convinced. But Imogen fell to earth. She entered the mortal plane, so she's corporeal. That's why we can both see her. You're gobsmacked, aren't you? I just... I believed everything I was told as a girl. The older I got... The more lies I uncovered. But angels here? I mean... I have so many questions I want to ask them. Good luck with that, luv. They're real cagey types. What do you need them to tell you? Where my powers come from, for starters. I mean, do they come from God or somewhere else? Doesn't matter where they came from. What matters is what you do with them and what it costs you. You act like religion is for suckers, but there it is. Evidence. How can you still be so cynical? Oh, wouldn't it be lovely if I wasn't? Could've been a better man if I hadn't seen it all. Yes, angels exist. Sound the bloody trumpets. As for religion, yeah, all right, be nice to your neighbor and all that, but... The world isn't all puppy dogs and rainbows. Can't just pray evil away. Still have to fight, hard, on our own. 
 
 (Water running) Akasha, mi geill mo prana ri sibh. (Speaking sanskrit) (Indistinct radio transmission) Says he's looking for Nate Byars. Nate Byars? What for? He's a murder suspect. Says he killed a police officer. And a doctor just outside of town. Nate would never hurt anyone. That officer must be mistaken. Nate was the first person you healed. it's dangerous to go playing with things you don't understand. We're not meant to understand God's plan. We're meant to execute it. Do you realize how foolish it is to think God gave you this power? This is about your glory, not God's. (Coughing) You're sick. Why didn't you ask me to heal you? Don't. You don't trust me. (Sighs) You've been different. (Sighs) Your head's not quiet. Started even before you got the power. I never paid no mind to it. Now I can't ignore it. I just felt daddy's death more deeply than you did. No. No, before daddy died. There's something you're not telling me. This power, whatever you do with it, it won't lighten that burden, whatever it may be. I need you to leave. And don't bother coming back to the church. I can't have a nonbeliever tainting my flock. I need to get this guy alone. Have a private chat with him at his house. I'll come with you. It's better if you stay here. Things could get unpleasant. Former girl scout, are we? Not exactly. You know, one of these days you're gonna have to let me be the mysterious one of the duo. One of these days. Remember, we have to save Zachary from himself. it's not his fault. He thinks he's doing good. Well, then I'll have to impress upon him his moral duty, won't I? Physically, if necessary. (Thunder cracks) (Knocking) I remember you. You feeling all better from your cold? Much. Ta. You'll have to wait until morning and wait in line again. God doesn't play favorites. I know about the angel feather. Whatever your intentions, you're doing more harm than good. And you are...? A concerned citizen. You have something that doesn't belong to you, and if you continue to use it, there will be a cost, not least of which will be a dead angel. People just love telling me what to do. I'm sure. How do I know that you'll return the feather to this... Angel you're talking about instead of taking the power for yourself? That's a good point. Sorry in advance. No! (Panting) That was the feather, not me. But it confirms one thing that I felt... You are the only evil here. Leave. And don't come back. (Crickets chirping) (Brush crunching) (Screams) (Gasping) (Grunting) (Nate growling) (Grunting) You okay? Yeah. Constantine :  I call them ghouls. They're formed by magic gone wrong. I recognized the one that attacked zed from an article online. The preacher, he healed his leg. Mortals aren't meant to wield the power of angels. Nate was the first one healed. More will turn, just like him. So why did he come after me? I don't think he was trying to kill you, luv. it looked to me that he was... Searching for something. When you touched Zachary, you had a vision, which means you took on some of his energy. Maybe he wanted Zachary to heal him again. We need to get the feather back to you. With the magic in its rightful place, it should stop the rest from turning. You need to work fast. She's getting weaker by the minute. Yeah, the trouble is, preacher Zachary has the feather's power on his side. (Cheering, rhythmic clapping) He was our friend, (snakes hissing, rattling) Our neighbor, our brother. But inside Nate Byars a darkness lay in wait. I offer my healing hand to those pure of heart. So we, powerful, may unite against the dark. Zed :  Preacher, I made a huge mistake. I trusted the wrong man. See, uh, my friend John, he doesn't care about me or anything that's happening here. I don't even know why he came. And you don't want to know. He had a dark purpose. You were right about me. I want to believe. Recognizing the path you're on is the first step in changing direction. I wish I could start all over. if your heart is true, it's never too late to surrender your will to God. What do you know about Baptism? Hallelujah! Crowd : Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the lord! Amen! You ready to leave your old life behind you? I am. I baptize you now in front of these witnesses. in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. And everybody said amen! Amen! Why? Why would you...? I had to. Get off! Get off! Man : Nancy, what's wrong? (Grunts) (Growling) (Grunting) Everybody run! (Screaming) (Growling) Look what you've done! This is what we were trying to avoid! Run to the church! Zed : Come on! Come on! Let's go! (Grunting) Go! Go! (Groans) Get in there! (Both grunting) (Grunting) (Grunts) They're after the feather. Zed, you have to get it to Imogen. Go out the back. What about you? We can hold it here. Go! (Banging on door) (Constantine pants loudly, rattling at door) It hurts so much. (Sighs) John is your best chance at getting that feather back. What...? What's it like? Pain. It comes in waves. You feel helpless. You can't fight it. It becomes about making it to the other side, shrinking your world down to one fine point. When that wave melts away, you feel relief. Just for a moment, till it comes back to remind you. So you feel pain now, but... What was it like the first moment the sun hit your skin? How good was that? (Constantine grunts, loud growling outside) Getting a little bit knackered here, mate. I could really use your help about now, yeah? I brought this on myself. Look, you got a little bit of power, and you got off your trolley, yeah? It happens. All we need to do is keep them at bay until Zed makes it to the angel, so just do us a bloody favor. Pull your head out of your ass and give us a hand, yeah? (Growling outside) This was never a gift from God. I never deserved it. I've sinned, and this here's my punishment. (Loud growling) That angel gets her feather back, and these bastards revert back to their mortal form. it should be... Any minute  now! I had too many that night. (Loud growling) It was a deer, I told myself. I never went back to check. I just left the mess behind. What are you saying? I know it wasn't a deer! (Growling continues) You killed a man. I never told no one. Didn't want my daddy looking at me the way he always did. You had a mortal sin on your soul when you nearly died, which means you weren't on your way to heaven when you saw the angel. You were on your way to hell. (Sighs) They're taking too long. Will John come through? if it serves him. Self-interest is natural for them. You noticed, too? Right, they have no idea the gift they were given when they got this world. We would have done better. Do you believe that? Of course. it's why we were put here. He gave them free will to stand on their own, but all they do is fall over and over... And over and over and over. We're nothing but crutches for his flawed creation. We shouldn't be talking like this. Why not? I want this world back, Manny. Just for ourselves. (Panting): I got it! You really think I was headed to hell? Zed... we can't let her give that feather to Imogen. We have to stop her. (Growling) (Constantine grunting, growling outside) Let's go. I deserve it! (Constantine panting, others growling) (Grunting) (Groaning) (Growling) This is not good. it worked. Beautifully. You're fallen. I have to admit, I thought a ghoul would deliver me the feather, but thank you, Zed. (Grunts) Looks like my protection spell to keep evil out is keeping evil in. A fallen angel finds a desperate bloke, intercepts him at the gates of hell and makes him think it's the gates of heaven. Zachary didn't take your feather. You put it in his hand so you could break through to earth. The ghouls were after the feather to bring it back to you? You make it sound so easy. I faked the heavenly angel part. Pain... That was real. Hell must have prepared you well. I'll never go back there. (Zed gasps loudly) Lift the spell, or I will kill her. I deserve to be out there. I served loyally for lifetimes. (Guttural gasping) Then I was cast out of heaven for one indiscretion. What did you do? I killed a mortal. I wanted to see how easy it would be. (Zed gasps) You're the only one who can stop this. You know I can't. You mean you won't. Help her! You're either in this bloody fight with me, or you're not. Come on. You know the rules! Manny! Guess you are on your own. Your angel did what they always do... Nothing! Like hell. (Grunting) (Groaning) (Gasps) Zed : John? What is this? No. You don't want to hold that for too long, luv. That's concentrated evil. I know I've disappointed more than a few of you. Got amends to make. I've, uh, felt the light of an angel and the hand of the devil. Though those are forces much greater than we are, the only thing more powerful is our ability to choose. if you'll open your hymnals to page 64, "all glory be thine." Manny : The preacher's back in his church, still fighting desperately to make amends for his sin, for the mistake that haunts him, hoping it's not too late to change his fate. Do you really think the preacher and I have anything in common? You should know by now I don't have all the answers. She fooled us all, mate. And that's not something I admit to lightly. There's just one thing I can't wrap my head around, though, and that's... How the bloody hell she managed to break through. The barrier between hell and earth is getting thinner, John. Thinner than it's ever been. Consequence of the rising darkness? But you saved the day. That's the kind of faith I can get behind. I will face consequences of my action. But, what Imogen did... Shouldn't have been possible. Seems anything that has the will to leave hell will find a way. But when they do, we'll be waiting for them. (Phone ringing) Hello. Eddie : Don't tell me there's another Giancarlo's in town. (Laughs airily) Eddie. (Sighs) I completely forgot. Oh, I... I can wait if you want. I'm so sorry. I just don't know if I'll be any good tonight. Can we do this some other time? Yeah, of course. Thank you. Um, I'm sorry you came all that way. It's no problem at all. Take the time you need. Thanks. Bye. She's not coming. Not tonight. Soon, then.
