 "...subsequent... to... I..." 
 "My dear Enid. After careful consideration regarding events preceding and subsequent to..." 
 Amen. 
 If you're going to pray in this synagogue, do so properly. 
 Nathan! 
 Nathan! 
 Nathan, what is it? 
 What's wrong with that boy? 
 Nathan, what's happening to you? 
 Nathan! 
 "My dear Enid. 
 I should like to apologize if during the investigation into..." 
 What are you chuntering on about, Murdoch? 
 Ah. Sir. I didn't hear you. 
 I-I'm, uh, attempting to compose a letter but having some difficulty. 
 Are you, now? 
 Well, I'm a bit of a wordsmith, you know. 
 It's rather personal. 
 Ah, a love letter. 
 Well, I'm a bit of an expert in that field as well. 
 It's a letter of apology, sir. 
 Apology? Who to? 
 Mrs. Jones. 
 For involving her and her son in the telegraph murder case and for using her as, well, frankly, sir, as bait. 
 Murdoch, if you don't mind a small observation from someone who knows a thing or two about women -- try flowers. 
 Beg your pardon, sirs. 
 We've just had a report of a murder in the Ward. 
 The Ward? 
 Oh, bloody perfect. 
 Well, good luck trying to get a straight answer out of those people, me old mucker. 
 What have we, George? 
 Sir, the victim is a young man by the name of Nathan Siebold. 
 Apparently dropped dead while praying. 
 The body? 
 This way. 
 It was so horrible. Confusing. 
 He just collapsed. 
 Had Mr. Siebold been ill? 
 For the last couple of weeks, he didn't seem well. 
 Isn't that right, Sam? 
 I see. 
 Two weeks. That's a rather long time. 
 I thought he was fasting. 
 But now... 
 And who reported the murder? 
 Murder? What are you talking about? 
 Someone reported a murder. 
 Who was it? 
 Well, gentlemen, you leave me no choice. 
 No one leaves. 
 I'll need to question everyone here. 
 Detective, there's no need. 
 I can tell you who the killer is. 
 Oh, you can? 
 Yes. 
 It is that book. 
 That book killed him. 
 In my experience, books don't kill people, Rabbi. 
 No, not literally. 
 But this book is forbidden. 
 It drives men mad. 
 Isn't it simply a Hebrew version of the Bible? 
 You mean the Torah. 
 No, it most certainly is not. 
 That book is part of the Zohar. 
 The most dangerous part. 
 Zohar. 
 But I thought it was a commentary on the Torah. 
 It is, and much more. 
 There are people like Nathan who believe hidden within it is the key to accessing the powers that created the universe. 
 Mm. Fascinating. 
 But what has that to do with Nathan's death? 
 The boy was obsessed by it. 
 He stopped sleeping. 
 Was fasting. 
 So much so, it killed him. 
 Jewish whiskey. 
 Can I pour you one? 
 Not while I'm on duty. Thank you. 
 Why was Nathan so fascinated with this power? 
 Ah, Detective. 
 I have no idea. 
 As far as I was concerned, he was a kofer. 
 What you would call a heretic. 
 Whatever it was he was searching for, we know where it led. 
 Mm. 
 If you felt that strongly about him, then what was he doing here? 
 Trouble getting a minyan lately. 
 Uh, 10 men for prayer. 
 Last couple of weeks, Nathan was here quite often. 
 Against my wishes, I don't mind telling you. 
 If you didn't invite him, then who did? 
 Sam Fineman. 
 You met him earlier. The young one. 
 Gentlemen, I will not ask you again to step aside! 
 Please, Constable, there's no need for confrontation. 
 George, what's the problem here? 
 Sir, they won't allow Dr. Ogden to remove the body. 
 Remove the body? 
 Who is this woman? 
 Rabbi, this is Dr. Julia Ogden with the coroner's office. 
 Rabbi, I need to remove Mr. Siebold's body in order to perform a postmortem examination. 
 That is impossible. 
 Jewish law forbids it. 
 Actually, Rabbi, I'm familiar with Jewish law in this regard. 
 And in the case of suspicious deaths, postmortems are permitted. 
 Fine. 
 As long as someone stays with it at all times. 
 To protect the body from evil. 
 Excuse me, gentlemen. 
 Nathan! 
 Oh, no. No, no. 
 Uh, ma'am, please. 
 Come on. 
 Don't touch me! 
 Devra. 
 You're to blame for this. 
 Please, Devra. You're not well. 
 Dr. Goldberg. Is this woman in your care? 
 Indeed she is, Dr. Ogden. 
 I'm afraid she must return to her bed at once. 
 Come along, now. 
 Let's go, my dear. Come on. 
 Going back up now. 
 Excuse us, please. 
 Her name is Devra Begelman. 
 And what she said meant nothing. 
 It -- Well, it did mean  something. 
 Just not the something you think it means. 
 I'm not sure I follow that. 
 I'm not sure it can be followed. 
 Six months ago, Nathan came to me claiming he and Devra were engaged to be married. 
 He said he had an agreement -- uh, some contract. 
 Did you see this contract? 
 Of course not. It doesn't exist. 
 Besides, Jewish law doesn't permit such things because of -- 
 Rebekah. 
 Rebekah? 
 From the Old Testament? 
 The Torah. 
 In the Torah, a servant of Isaac's, upon seeing Rebekah, asks her family if she can become Isaac's bride. 
 And they say, "Let us ask the maiden." 
 Precisely. 
 How modern. 
 And it is this idea, that the woman's approval must be asked, that has been followed ever since. 
 So, of course, when the boy came to me with this story of his... 
 I had to say no. 
 Yet clearly Miss Begelman had feelings for Mr. Siebold. 
 I would have to agree. 
 Why did they not simply marry? 
 Because she had already agreed to marry someone else. 
 She was betrothed? 
 To whom? 
 Simon Goldberg? The doctor? 
 He's got to be 25 years her senior. 
 Still, nothing odd about an older man and a young girl, I suppose. 
 No, but Miss Begelman's reaction would suggest that she and Nathan Siebold were more than just friends. 
 A love triangle. 
 Possibly. 
 So the boy goes off tomcatting, picks the wrong lass, and jealous fiancé doesn't appreciate it. 
 You'd better look into this. 
 Right away. 
 Oh, and, Murdoch, tread carefully. 
 Carefully, sir? 
 There's two kinds of Jews in this town, Murdoch. 
 There's this new lot, fresh off the boat. 
 They stick to themselves. 
 Then there's the old generation from England. 
 Moneyed, with powerful friends. 
 Simon Goldberg is one of those. 
 I'll keep that in mind. 
 Sir. 
 You have a visitor. 
 Rabbi, please. 
 May I remind you that every drop of blood must be preserved because -- 
 The body must be buried whole and intact and as quickly as possible. 
 Yes. 
 Rest assured, Rabbi, I will take good care of Mr. Siebold. 
 The flowers you sent were beautiful. 
 Well, I hadn't heard from you in some time and felt as though I should apologize for -- 
 William, there was no need. 
 I was merely thinking. 
 Enid... I should never have involved you in the case against -- 
 Oh, no, please. 
 T-There's no need to apologize for that. 
 Well, I feel as though I should apologize for something. 
 I do believe that's the first smile I've seen from you in some time. 
 I worry for you. 
 For your safety. 
 St. Michael. 
 The patron saint of policemen. 
 Would you keep it, for my sake? 
 Absolutely. 
 Hello. Detective William Murdoch. 
 We're here to see Miss Devra Begelman. 
 Nice area. 
 The Begelmans have a lovely house. 
 You'll have a nice home of your own someday, George. 
 Huh. Not on $1.20 a day, sir. 
 Yes? 
 Dr. Goldberg, isn't it? 
 And you are? 
 Detective William Murdoch. 
 And this is Constable George Crabtree. 
 We're here to see Miss Begelman. 
 I'm afraid that she's not up to visitors, Detective. 
 That's fine. We'll speak with you, then. 
 This is not a good time. 
 Detective, you must understand that -- Detective! 
 She's delirious. Take her arms. 
 You tried to keep us apart! 
 But she's mine! 
 She'll die without me! Don't you see?! 
 Who is she referring to? 
 No! Don't you see?! 
 Roll up her sleeve. 
 Sir, I think she thinks we're trying to kill her. 
 What are you injecting her with? 
 It's a sedative. 
 You can't stop our love. 
 You can't stop it! 
 Shh. 
 Rabbi, I believe I know what caused Nathan's death. 
 But to confirm it, I'll need to perform one last procedure. 
 So what's stopping you? You've already gone this far. 
 It requires tissue to be dissolved in sulfuric acid. 
 A fingernail would do. 
 I suppose in the eyes of God a fingernail, more or less... what's it gonna matter? 
 How long has she been like this? 
 Over a week. 
 She started complaining of headaches. 
 Nausea. 
 Clearly, she's suffering from a very serious fever. 
 Cholera, I suspect. 
 Now come these damn hallucinations. 
 My superstitious coreligionists would put it down to the work of a dybbuk. 
 A dybbuk? 
 A demon. 
 If she is possessed by a spirit, it's likely that of Nathan Siebold's. 
 Wouldn't you agree, Doctor? 
 No, I certainly would not. 
 Still, you must realize how it appears. 
 How does it appear? 
 That your fiancée and Mr. Siebold were involved. 
 I assure you, Detective, Devra and I are quite happy. 
 Perhaps. 
 But it would be best if Miss Begelman could confirm that. 
 As you well know, that is not possible. 
 Perhaps her father can, then. 
 Good day, Doctor. 
 Nathan? 
 Nathan? 
 It's all right, my dear. 
 Everything's going to be fine. 
 You just need to rest. 
 Ah. Detective William Murdoch. 
 Here to see Mr. Begelman. 
 Is busy. 
 You don't want to make us ask you twice. 
 Constable, I don't think that will be necessary, right? 
 You're quite mistaken, Detective. 
 Dr. Goldberg had nothing to do with that boy's death. 
 You deny Nathan Siebold and your daughter were involved? 
 Uh, Devra is young and impressionable. 
 Nathan insinuated himself in her mind somehow. 
 He probably used that meshugga book on her. 
 Why would Nathan do that? 
 He wanted a better life. 
 That's why we all came to this country. 
 But getting it through my daughter, that's not right. 
 That's very good, Morris. 
 Constable, this would look very good on you. 
 What's your favorite color? 
 Well, I've been told green makes my eyes come out. 
 Uh, but as an officer of the law, I can't accept such gifts, as handsome as they are, thank you. 
 Don't get me wrong, Detective. 
 I liked Nathan. He worked hard. 
 All my people work hard. 
 Nathan worked for you? 
 Yes. That's how he and Devra met. 
 He was a good boy. 
 But that book -- It affected his mind. 
 Oh. 
 Uh, something's come up. 
 Will you excuse me? 
 George, speak with the workers. 
 See what you can find out about Nathan Siebold. 
 Sir. 
 Sam Fineman. 
 I already told those coppers back at the synagogue everything I know. 
 Did they ask you about the relationship between Nathan and Devra? 
 First I heard of it. 
 You mean Nathan never told his best friend that he was in love? 
 We just worked together. 
 That's not what I was led to believe. 
 Then you were misled. 
 You know of anyone who might have wanted to harm Nathan? 
 Nobody I know. 
 Simon Goldberg, perhaps? 
 Look, I told you -- I don't know anything. 
 If you don't mind, I got to get back to work. 
 Begelman only pays by the piece. 
 Oh, so you can't really tell? 
 All right. 
 George, find out anything? 
 Sir, very little. 
 Apparently, Mr. Siebold liked to keep to himself. 
 The only person he really chatted with was Sam Fineman. 
 Who just led me to believe he barely knew Nathan. 
 I suspect Mr. Fineman knows more than he's saying. 
 Chained shut. 
 Sir, it's a sweatshop, isn't it? 
 Probably. 
 Ah. Detective. 
 Constable. 
 It's Dr. Ogden, sir. 
 She needs to speak with you urgently. 
 It's black. There's no question of it. 
 Nathan Siebold died of arsenic poisoning. 
 How was it administered? 
 The poison had seeped into every organ. 
 Suggesting he had been exposed to it for some time. 
 Exactly. Perhaps in his food or drink or a place he visited. 
 Or something he came in contact with. 
 Quite possibly. 
 May I borrow this? 
 Why, of course. 
 Right, then. 
 So this is your theory, Murdoch -- The book killed him. 
 Nathan handled it constantly. 
 He could have easily transferred the poison from his fingers to his mouth. 
 I suppose we'd best be checking with the local chemists to see who's been purchasing arsenic. 
 The men are already doing so. 
 And the motive? 
 I still suspect a love triangle. 
 Can we even prove there was one? 
 Nathan Siebold's entire life was contained in this book. 
 I'm hoping that these letters and documents will offer some concrete proof. 
 It's all in bloody Jewish. 
 Yiddish, sir. 
 And you're conversant, no doubt. 
 No, I am not. 
 So while I await my test results, I shall consult someone who is. 
 Why me? 
 Because I need someone I can trust to translate those words. 
 And you were his friend. 
 I told you, I just -- 
 I know. I know. You only worked with him. 
 Why won't you help me? 
 Mister, when is the last time a cop helped someone around here? 
 Mr. Fineman, your friend is dead. 
 Right. A murder. 
 That's the only thing that brings you to the Ward. 
 I'm here now. 
 And if you don't help me, Nathan's killer could walk away a free man. 
 I got to get back to work. 
 It was you that called the station, wasn't it? 
 You reported the murder. 
 The first time I saw this, I took it for the Star of David. 
 There's a certain resemblance. 
 In fact, it's the alchemic symbol for arsenic. 
 I did not kill that boy. 
 He had been here over the course of the past two weeks -- the same period of time he exhibited the symptoms. 
 Nonsense! 
 You said so yourself. 
 Further, you despised his misuse of the Zohar. 
 And I what? Poisoned him? 
 Detective, do you really imagine that I would contravene one of God's commandments? 
 Why keep this here, Rabbi? 
 For the rats. We have lots of them. 
 Just another reason why we're leaving. 
 You're leaving? 
 That's right. 
 We sold the synagogue. 
 Tomorrow we leave the Ward and move into our new home. 
 I thought you would have known about it. 
 Why would you think that? 
 It was in all the papers. 
 Not just the Yiddish ones. 
 Big headlines -- "Hebrews Buy Old Church." 
 What's this got to do with anything? 
 Notice the date. 
 Six months ago. 
 Roughly the same time Nathan Siebold confronted the rabbi about Devra Begelman. 
 You're thinking there's a connection. 
 The timing could be coincidental. 
 But it does make me wonder. 
 Where does an impoverished synagogue suddenly find the money to buy a new building? 
 Goldberg. 
 The man's a moneybags. He could have backed them. 
 But why? 
 Perhaps he's not as certain of his engagement to Miss Begelman as he would have us believe. 
 Buying off the rabbi. 
 Listen, let me make a few discreet inquiries at the Land Office, see if I can find some details. 
 Very good. 
 
 
 
 I believe Dr. Ogden is here to consult on my test results. 
 Gray. 
 There are traces of arsenic on the book, but not enough to have caused death. 
 Suggesting that somewhere in his travels, Nathan  and  the book were both exposed to the arsenic. 
 That would be my suspicion. 
 What exactly is this? 
 It's one of the books of the Zohar, a mystical rumination on the nature of God. 
 Sounds most intriguing. 
 For the most part. 
 However, it does contain some rather impenetrable poems. 
 Though some seem to be a commentary on the Song of Solomon. 
 Oh. 
 "The song of songs, which is Solomon's. 
 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth." 
 "For thy love is better than wine." 
 Were they in love? 
 I'm certain of it. 
 A poor working boy and the daughter of a wealthy factory owner. 
 Torn apart by circumstance. 
 Drawn together by fate. 
 Star-crossed lovers. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Yes, George. 
 The lads have checked with the chemists, and I've been through the poison book. 
 One name did stand out in particular. 
 Devra Begelman. 
 Interesting. 
 How recently did she purchase the arsenic? 
 Just over two weeks ago. 
 Roughly the same period that he had been ill and she had been suffering from cholera. 
 Cholera? 
 Its symptoms are almost identical to arsenic poisoning. 
 You again. 
 Detective, I thought all of your questions had been answered. 
 Not all. 
 Do you recognize this? 
 It's Devra's. 
 It's a beauty treatment for her skin. 
 And this symbol? 
 Well, it's arsenic. What of it? 
 All the young girls are using it these days. 
 And surely, as a doctor, you realize that cholera and arsenic poisoning have very similar symptoms. 
 Of course I do. 
 Nathan Siebold died of arsenic poisoning, and I suspect that Devra is suffering from the same thing. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Somebody has poisoned Devra. 
 Not somebody.  You. 
 Me? 
 Why would I possibly want to hurt her? 
 Maybe she was betraying you. 
 Or perhaps she was accidentally exposed when you poisoned Nathan. 
 I warn you. 
 These are nothing more than wild accusations. 
 For now. 
 But soon, Dr. Goldberg, I assure you, I will have my proof. 
 Detective. 
 Whatever you may think of me and my engagement to Devra, I assure you of one thing. 
 I love her. 
 More than anything in this entire world. 
 How much arsenic did Miss Begelman purchase? 
 Eight ounces, sir. 
 There were only 3 ounces left. 
 Bloody hell. What's she doing, bathing in it? 
 Even if she only used an ounce, where's the rest? 
 More than likely it ended up in Nathan Siebold. 
 Right. So it all fits. 
 Goldberg is jealous. 
 He did have access to Devra's arsenic. 
 Slip the boy the poison. 
 What about Devra? Did he poison her, too? 
 Not likely. 
 A man like Goldberg wants to keep his prize. 
 Right, Murdoch? 
 Actually, sir, I'm not convinced of his guilt. 
 What, you don't think it's Goldberg now? 
 Dr. Goldberg seemed genuinely surprised when I suggested Devra was suffering from arsenic poisoning. 
 Further, he would have needed regular access to Nathan in order to poison him. 
 So now we don't even have a suspect? 
 Uh, Detective. 
 We've just had a report of a beating coming in. 
 Bloody hell, Higgins. Just deal with it. 
 Well, I think Detective Murdoch might want to deal with this personally, sir. 
 Mr. Fineman. 
 It appears we need to talk. 
 I've got nothing to say. 
 Mr. Fineman, I think you should let us take you to a hospital. 
 No. I'm not going to any hospital. 
 You've been badly hurt. 
 I don't have any money. 
 I don't think that's the reason. 
 Are you involved in something illegal? 
 Is that why you won't cooperate with me? 
 I believe you are. 
 And that Nathan was as well -- and it cost him his life. 
 You say the police won't help, but when we try to, you refuse. 
 I'm not doing anything illegal. 
 What is it, then? 
 I've been organizing. 
 Organizing? How so? A union? 
 You've seen the way Begelman treats us. 
 Who did this to you? 
 That dumb Pole, Jerzy. 
 What about Nathan? 
 Was he involved as well? 
 The only thing he did was take my night shifts the past little while so I could hold some meetings. 
 Did Jerzy know this? 
 I don't know. 
 George, I believe we need to pay Mr. Jerzy a visit. 
 Agreed. 
 Mr. Fineman, there is still something I could use your help with. 
 Get back here, you big b*st*rd! 
 That's quite the cut you have on your hand, Mr. Piezlowski. 
 I get when you throw me to ground. 
 I sue you. 
 Are you sure it isn't from when you beat Sam Fineman? 
 Where were you yesterday at 5:00? 
 When? 
 5:00. 
 Comes after 4:00. 
 Hmm. 
 Was in shop. 
 Did anyone see you? 
 Sure. Jew boss. 
 Mr. Begelman? 
 Yeah. 
 Then say Mr. Begelman. 
 What about Nathan Siebold? 
 Do you know anything about his death? 
 You really aren't doing anything to help your case, Mr. Piezlowski. 
 Did you just gob on my floor? 
 Murdoch. 
 I've just heard from a colleague at city hall. 
 Do you know who bought the old church for the rabbi? 
 Dr. Simon Goldberg. 
 Wrong. 
 Simon Goldberg  and  Isaac Begelman. 
 It seems they've been buying up worthless properties all over the Ward. 
 Why would they do that? 
 Let's find out, shall we? 
 You're in big trouble, sunshine. 
 Hey! Wipe that smirk off your face and look at me! 
 Not only did you beat a man senseless, but you've just gobbed on my floor. 
 Detective Murdoch here is gonna ask you a couple of questions. 
 If you answer correctly, then we might be able to save you from the noose. 
 Noose? 
 That got your attention. 
 We think that you poisoned that lad who was after your boss's daughter. 
 Not me. I don't know anything about it. 
 No? Convince us. 
 Start by answering the questions that are put to you. 
 Detective. 
 What do you know about Mr. Begelman's business? 
 I-I know all. 
 What do you know about his dealings with Dr. Simon Goldberg? 
 Goldberg? 
 He makes money. 
 A lot of it. 
 Why are they buying up homes in the Ward? 
 They know city tear it down soon. 
 Then more buildings come. 
 Begelman and Goldberg, they get filthy rich. 
 And what about Nathan Siebold's death? 
 Do you know anything about his poisoning? 
 Nothing. I swear. 
 Is truth. 
 I-I answer right? 
 Very good. 
 Now there's just one little matter to clean up before I'm done with you. 
 Begelman knows the residents want out of the Ward. 
 He also knows the value of the land will go up soon. 
 But he doesn't have the financial clout. 
 So he needs someone like Dr. Goldberg to back him. 
 To cement the deal, he offers up his daughter in marriage. 
 Yes. 
 Goldberg gets a beautiful wife, Begelman secures her future, and they both profit handsomely from the land deal. 
 But then along comes Nathan Siebold. 
 Devra falls in love with him and the whole plan is threatened. 
 So they slip him arsenic. 
 But only a bit at a time to make it appear as though he's taken ill. 
 Diabolical. 
 But we don't have one bit of proof, do we? 
 No. 
 Sir, Mr. Fineman is here to see you. 
 They're mostly love letters from Devra. 
 A couple of them are from folks back in the old country. 
 And that's it? 
 Well, there's that one. 
 That's a marriage contract promising Devra Begelman to Nathan Siebold. 
 Signed by both their fathers. 
 Is it, now? 
 You told me a marriage contract didn't exist. 
 And it doesn't. 
 Rabbi, your elusiveness is growing tiresome. 
 Detective, this piece of paper exists, but it means nothing. 
 As I told you before, it violates Jewish law. 
 I suspect you aren't telling me the entire truth. 
 You would say this to a religious man? 
 Nathan Siebold was a devout student. 
 He would have known the law. 
 So there had to be more to his visit. 
 Nathan confronted me. 
 Showed me the contract, and I said to him what I said to you earlier. 
 "Let us ask the maiden." 
 And he said, "So ask her." 
 Not whether she loved him, but if she loved Simon Goldberg. 
 But you didn't do that. 
 There was no need! 
 As I said to him, we already asked the maiden. 
 She said she would marry Dr. Goldberg. 
 That's the end of it. 
 Rabbi, was Jewish law the reason for this ruling, or was it something else? 
 What are you implying? 
 Isaac Begelman bought you off so that his daughter's marriage to his business partner wouldn't be jeopardized. 
 You make it sound so sordid. 
 Isn't it? 
 Look around. 
 Look how we live. 
 So when Begelman came forward to help, who am I to refuse? 
 What of Nathan and Devra and their love for one another? 
 Given the same choice, knowing it would better the lives of so many, I would do it again. 
 All for the greater good. 
 All for the greater good. 
 My conscience is clear. 
 I met Max Siebold on the boat coming over 15 years ago. 
 My wife was dead. 
 I didn't know if I'd be able to take care of Devra. 
 So you arranged a marriage. 
 Max claimed he had money. 
 It was for Devra I did it. 
 We parted company on the dock in Halifax. 
 That was the last time I ever heard of Max or that contract. 
 Until Nathan showed up. 
 Yes. 
 Out of respect for his father, I offer him a job. 
 How does he repay me? 
 He tries to steal away my daughter, even though she's already in love. 
 With Dr. Goldberg. 
 Of course with Dr. Goldberg. 
 Whose fortune conveniently enables you to finance your land deals. 
 And so what? 
 Uh, I'm a murderer? 
 No. 
 No, you're a man who had a boy nearly beaten to death for trying to organize a union. 
 You're a man who has sold his daughter -- twice. 
 That's enough. 
 Do you deny buying up land in the Ward, knowing it will increase in value? 
 Do you deny running a sweatshop? 
 So that's what this is? 
 The Jew is buying land. The Jew is getting ahead. 
 What's it gonna be next? The Jew is poisoning wells? 
 This is about murder, Mr. Begelman. 
 No, this is about persecution. 
 This is a witch hunt, and I will not tolerate it any longer. 
 So either you provide your proof or you let me go. 
 I thought so. 
 Begelman's guilty. I'm certain of it. 
 But proving it... 
 Look, you've shown motive and means. 
 But opportunity -- I don't see it. 
 You mean how the poison was administered? 
 You have a boy, a girl, and a book all exposed to arsenic. 
 Find out where, and you might catch the killer. 
 All this talk of love triangles must be clouding your bloody noggin. 
 "Behold... thou art fair, my love. 
 For thy love is better than wine." 
 William. 
 This is so lovely, meeting here like this on a whim. 
 I must confess, I am not here on a whim. 
 Enid, there's something I must tell you. 
 Of course. 
 I thought I was over her. 
 The truth is... 
 The truth is... 
 The truth is, this case is proving nettlesome. 
 Is this why you wanted to see me, William? 
 To discuss the case? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Yet it is a very fascinating one. 
 It seems two young people were promised to each other when they were very young. 
 And in spite of all odds, separated by many years and many miles, they somehow came together. 
 Of course they did, William. 
 It was their destiny. 
 When two people are meant to be together, nothing can keep them apart. 
 Don't you agree? 
 William? 
 The steam. 
 That's how it was done. 
 How what was done? 
 Enid, I-- 
 I'm very sorry. I... 
 William... 
 Sam, you told me Nathan had been working your shifts for you. 
 Yeah. What about it? 
 For how long? 
 Couple weeks. 
 Roughly the same amount of time Nathan had been ill. 
 Yeah, I guess that would be about right. 
 Sam, I believe that poison was meant for you. 
 Me? 
 It was planted in your machine to stop you from organizing. 
 So... Nathan died instead of me? 
 He'd -- He'd still be alive if I hadn't... 
 Sam... did Devra ever visit him on those midnight shifts? 
 I-I don't know. I... 
 I don't. I really don't. 
 Oh, God. 
 There's nothing you could have done. 
 I knew Begelman was evil, but this... 
 I have had enough of these intrusions, Detective. 
 I just need a word with Miss Begelman. 
 She is feeling better, is she not? 
 The arsenic has mostly left her body. 
 But she's still very weak. 
 She's in no condition for your questions. 
 I will be brief, I can assure you. 
 Very well. 
 If it will finally bring an end to all this. 
 Miss Begelman? 
 I'm Detective William Murdoch. 
 Is this about Nathan? 
 You were in love with him, weren't you? 
 I knew from the moment I saw him that we were meant to be. 
 You met Nathan in your father's factory. 
 We found ways to be together. 
 I would go in after midnight, when Nathan was the only one in the pressing room. 
 No one knew. 
 How did you find out? 
 You both breathed steam in from the pressing machine. 
 I believe it was contaminated with arsenic. 
 Nathan more so. 
 And it cost him his life. 
 But... 
 But why would the machine have arsenic in it? 
 It was intended for Sam Fineman, to stop him from forming a union. 
 Who would do such a thing? 
 Devra... the arsenic that you had been using on your face. 
 Whose idea was it to purchase it? 
 Papa said that I should buy some to make my skin glow for the wedding. 
 You mean... Papa... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I always thought that it was a passing infatuation. 
 That one day she would come to love me. 
 Do you know what it's like to love someone and know that their heart isn't yours? 
 I believe I do. 
 If only I could undo everything. 
 For Devra's sake. 
 You love her that much? 
 More than you could possibly imagine. 
 And you're sure there's arsenic here? 
 There should be traces of it throughout the immediate area. 
 What is the meaning of this? First you invade my home. 
 Then you turn my factory upside down. 
 When will this harassment cease? 
 When you're revealed for the murderer you are. 
 I am no such thing. 
 We believe that you put arsenic in that machine to keep your factory from being unionized. 
 Me? 
 There's many people here don't want a union. 
 They could do it as easily as me. 
 You did ask your daughter to buy the arsenic. 
 So it's a crime to want your daughter to look beautiful on her wedding day? 
 Have you nothing more, Detective? 
 You'll not get away with this. That much I promise. 
 No court of law would convict me. 
 Is that an admission of guilt, Mr. Begelman? 
 No. It's not. 
 But I think it's time to contact my barristers. 
 Mr. Goldberg! 
 Now she's free of him. 
 And me. 
 Coming to the cemetery? 
 I don't think so. 
 I understand Miss Begelman will be taking over her father's factory. 
 Yeah. That's what I hear. 
 Apparently, she thinks unions is a good idea. 
 Oh. Well, good luck with the organizing. 
 I know who to call if I have any trouble, don't I? 
 Indeed you do. 
 That poor girl. 
 Her father cost her the love of her life. 
 Dr. Goldberg -- He'll -- He'll hang, won't he? 
 I think so. 
 He did love her. 
 Yes, he did. 
 So much so that he ensured her father could never hurt her again. 
 I suppose now she's free to find another. 
 I'm not sure about that, William. 
 Can you find true love more than once in a lifetime? 
 I don't know. 
 I should be going. 
 Yes. 
 Good day, Doctor. 
 Detective. 
 "Dear Enid..."
