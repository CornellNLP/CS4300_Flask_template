 Student card identifies her as Alexandra Manghan. 
  Garda says her friends called her Lexie. 
  The stabbing in Glenskehy is potentially linked to Katy in Knocknaree and Maddox is working that case now. 
  Thank God you're home. 
  What's your plan with Danny boy? 
  Thinks he has them all like puppets on a string. 
  We break the others. 
  We get to him. 
  Detective Reilly. 
  I came soon as I could Shane Waters. 
  He's alive. 
  So this is our star witness? 
  You should've talked her out it. 
  Cassie. 
  Come back. 
  Who are you? 
  Uniform Zulu six-seven, Garda Cassie Maddox here. 
  Requiring urgent assistance. 
  On foot, on Frederick Street heading towards Stephen's Green. 
  Received, six-seven. 
  If I leave it in, you stand a chance Come in, six-seven. 
  but if I take it out [SHE WAILS.] Snagged on a rib a bit there, didn't I? 
  A number of units on their way There now, Lexie or whatever your name is. 
  There now. 
  Six-seven [SHE GASPS FOR BREATH.] You brought me a stalk. 
  I'm so touched. 
  Yeah, I only meant to have one. 
  When do I get my place in Murder? 
  You know how many jobs an undercover can do in Ireland? 
  Two. 
  If you were in America or Australia, you could be undercover your whole career but not in this tiny country. 
  You get known. 
  Two jobs. 
  You've got one left. 
  Murder. 
  That's the deal. 
  Come on. 
  You're breaking my heart. 
  I feel rejected. 
  Yeah, all right. 
  When you agree to trauma counselling. 
  Christ's sake, I don't need it, I'm not traumatised. 
  You don't agree, you don't pass the psych assessment. 
  You wouldn't have to do it, so I don't see why I should have to. 
  But I did do it. 
  Yeah. 
  Sat in a room with a big box of tissues on the table in case I, you know, broke down. 
  I said I trusted their process and was feeling stronger week-by-week. 
  I even shed a manly tear. 
  So you do the same. 
  You be a good little maniac. 
  You go to the counselling, tell them a story. 
  You let them tick their boxes or they'll put you in admin forever. 
  OK? 
  I'm trusting the process. 
  Feeling stronger week-by-week. 
  And every day I'm just overwhelmed with how lucky I am to have made it. 
  I'm just so happy to still be living. 
  What did you give her? 
  Enough. 
  She's out cold. 
  Put your back into it, will you? 
  She keeps slipping. 
  - What if you're wrong? 
  - I'm not. 
  You can't fake how you kiss. 
  It's like a fingerprint. 
  What are you doing? 
  Proving it. 
  There's nothing there. 
  That's not nothing. 
  It's not new. 
  It's not recent. 
  It's an old scar. 
  It's still proof. 
  It's not her. 
  I've said it from the start, it's not Lexie. 
  Try this again, Rafe. 
  Take her legs. 
  Rafe! 
  Do you know Jonathan Devlin, Mr Andrews? 
  He ran the campaign Move the Motorway. 
  I've heard of him, yeah, the father of that poor little girl. 
  Katy. 
  Her name was Katy. 
  Died from blunt force trauma and suffocation. 
  And she knew what was happening. 
  Struggled. 
  Horrific. 
  Mr Devlin made some very serious allegations about land fraud and financial corruption. 
  There's always people who resist progress. 
  Who needs a motorway that goes from nowhere to nowhere? 
  Rural development. 
  We're building a modern, forward-facing future for this country. 
  It's not about private individuals - buying up land using tax-payers' money? 
  - Absolutely not. 
  Did you ever make intimidatory phone calls to Jonathan Devlin? 
  No. 
  - Never had any contact with him? 
  - No. 
  Mr Andrews, Terence Can I call you Terry? 
  You kept the same mobile number you used to call Jonathan Devlin. 
  You kept using it. 
  The same number, my dude! 
  How is someone as pig-shit thick as you allowed out on your own? 
  I want you to repeat this after me, slowly and clearly, for the tape. 
  That's a lovely daughter you've got there, Jonathan. 
  Talented too. 
  Shame if anything where to happen to her. 
  If you could repeat those words, Mr Andrews, then we can play the tape to Jonathan Devlin and he can identify you as the man who threatened him and his daughter. 
  His 13-year-old, murdered daughter Katy. 
  I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here. 
  Try and get some sleep. 
  You're going to need a clear head. 
  Poor little girl, you poor thing. 
  You poor little girl, you. 
  Get the f*ck away from my baby. 
  Shane. 
  Your little girl, Jonny. 
  Poor little girl. 
  And it's our fault. 
  We raised the darkness. 
  There's no such thing. 
  That little boy with the blood in his shoes, those two other children and now your Katy. 
  The Gardai are looking for you. 
  This detective. 
  Keeps asking about back then, when you smashed your face up. 
  He keeps asking why. 
  And Cathal says, if he sees you again, he'll leave you in a ditch. 
  I believe him, too. 
  That's your problem right there, Jonny. 
  You always believe Cathal. 
  How long will you be staying? 
  Am I in the way? 
  No, it's just You've never stayed before. 
  I never being kicked out of my flat before. 
  Why did she kick you out? 
  Oh, I don't know. 
  Inadequate sexual technique. 
  Are you trying to shock me? 
  Are you shocked? 
  - No. 
  - Oh, thank f*ck for that. 
  Wouldn't want to start off on the wrong foot. 
  I'm going for a shower. 
  [TEXT ALERT.] [SCREECHING.] [SCREAMING.] It's been interesting watching you dream. 
  What did you give me? 
  Ketamine and Rohypnol. 
  [CLATTER.] It's just water. 
  I need to pee. 
  What's your name? 
  Cassie Maddox. 
  Detective Garda Cassie Maddox. 
  You've had some texts. 
  From your tutor. 
  But it's not your tutor though, is it? 
  No. 
  Detective Mackey, I reckon. 
  He'll be expecting a response from you to let him know you're OK, what do I tell him? 
  He won't be expecting an answer. 
  OK. 
  Good. 
  I'll make some coffee and we'll discuss the options. 
  That would be sensible. 
  It's my friends, you know? 
  I have to take care of my friends. 
  Daniel, no, please, please, please. 
  Please don't hurt me, please, please, please, don't hurt me. 
  That's my gun. 
  Oh, God, Oh, God, please, please, don't hurt me. 
  Abby, it's all right, it's all right. 
  Just tell him! 
  Do you think I'm f*cking stupid? 
  He won't be expecting an answer, tell me what I text him! 
  Abby, just keep looking at me. 
  Tell me, right now, what I text him to keep him away. 
  Text him and say I'm researching - and I'll be in touch in a couple of days. 
  - f*cking liar! 
  It's the truth, I promise. 
  Take the gun away from her head, please. 
  OK. 
  - Ow. 
  - Sorry. 
  - OK? 
  - Mm-hm. 
  Go. 
  Well done. 
  Your gun. 
  My house. 
  Mine. 
  I know every inch of it. 
  Come on. 
  Unless you want to piss in the corner. 
  I've got a sighting of Shane Waters for you. 
  At the old bonding warehouse down the docks. 
  You know, they didn't know his name, they did recognise him from the description of his jacket. 
  You look busy. 
  Terence Andrews is in the cells, sweating and panicking. 
  It's a beautiful sight. 
  I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to O'Neill. 
  Detective O'Neill, I'd like you give me an update on your progress on the land fraud investigation. 
  Not Quigley, you. 
  You don't want to do this today. 
  Or any other day. 
  No, I really do. 
  This is the day I want to do it. 
  - What's going on? 
  - I screwed Maddox. 
  But you knew that, Quigley. 
  You've been bitching about it for long enough. 
  But poor O'Neill was in love with her, so now he's all cheated and betrayed and sad. 
  Have I got it about right? 
  sh1t. 
  Oh, sh1t. 
  Say your piece, you must be choking on it by now. 
  Let's hear you, big man, then we can have a gentleman's handshake. 
  Oh! 
  Is that it? 
  Is that all? 
  Pushing and shoving? 
  - I can do that all day! 
  - Not here, f*ck's sake, not here Oh, come on, you've got more than that. 
  Break my jaw or something, my ribs. 
  I should be spitting out teeth. 
  Knock me out. 
  Jesus, Reilly, what's the matter with you? 
  Just piss off. 
  You know what she told me? 
  When she woke up in hospital after being stabbed, she was disappointed to still be alive. 
  You were the consolation prize for breathing, for still having a pulse. 
  So, come on. 
  Right here. 
  Unleash the f*cking beast, O'Neill. 
  Do it. 
  Do it! 
  Are you on meth? 
  And you, not one single word about this. 
  - What happens in Vegas, right? 
  - Vegas? 
  Stays in Vegas. 
  - Gobshite! 
  - Sorry. 
  What was that about sightings? 
  Shane Waters. 
  We have him spotted two nights ago down by the Let's get out of here. 
  Where? 
  We'll go to Mallin-Davis. 
  Tell them their man's in the cells and in need of legal advice. 
  Let's be a right pair of bastards, huh? 
  Rattle some bones, see what happens. 
  Come on, Sam. 
  Listen to your partner for once. 
  Don't be scared, I'm going to take care of everything. 
  Feel better? 
  I thought you might want these. 
  Did you go inside my clothes and remove my bandage? 
  I had to show them. 
  He said there'd be nothing there but there is. 
  A scar. 
  On you. 
  A coincidence. 
  Shall we? 
  Oh, God, be careful I know what I'm doing. 
  Where's your grandfather's gun, Daniel? 
  It's safe. 
  Hello! 
  I thought we agreed you were going to have a sleep. 
  No, YOU suggested I have a sleep but I thought it was a better idea to get absolutely shit-faced instead. 
  Go on. 
  What do we call you? 
  Cassie. 
  Or Detective Maddox, it's up to you. 
  Ah! 
  Oh! 
  This is just fantastic! 
  What's the plan, Dan? 
  What's the strategy, master tactician? 
  We're all going to be fine. 
  Oh, amazing. 
  Amazing! 
  Bring on the dancing girls! 
  Pizza for everyone! 
  We are all going to be fine! 
  How? 
  You're agitated. 
  - You need a cup of tea. 
  - I don't want a cup of sodding tea! 
  Listen, listen, listen, this is what we do. 
  We pack, just a few things, we travel light, we go to Cork airport, or Knock, that's tiny, it's just nuns there and we get the first flight out, the first flight anywhere. 
  I'll buy the tickets. 
  OK. 
  And what about her? 
  Just tie her up. 
  Lock her in the cellar again. 
  - We'll leave you food. 
  - Thanks. 
  How long have we got until someone starts looking for her? 
  A few days. 
  Unless she's lying. 
  I thought you were going to shoot Abby in the head. 
  I wasn't going to risk that. 
  A few days. 
  Well, when we're out of here, we can call the Gardai and tell them exactly where she is and, by that time, we can be anywhere. 
  Anywhere we want. 
  Because you know, prison? 
  That is not on my trajectory. 
  So?! 
  Probably best to wait till it gets dark, so no-one can watch us leave. 
  Yeah, I suppose. 
  OK. 
  OK. 
  - OK. 
  - Justin, the tea. 
  Are you OK? 
  Yes. 
  What's this for? 
  We're going to play a little game, just to pass the time. 
  It's called Truth or Dare. 
  The truth about what? 
  The fact that you're a sociopathic bitch, that came in here to ruin us. 
  Sit down. 
  I'm looking for a man. 
  He wears a road mender's jacket. 
  Have you seen him? 
  Shane? 
  [HE COUGHS.] Little boy? 
  Little boy, it's OK. 
  It's OK little boy, let go. 
  Let go. 
  What do you reckon Terry'll do when he finds out - his employers deny he exists? 
  - Cry? 
  20 says he sh1ts himself. 
  Literally sh1ts. 
  - And then cries. 
  - You're on. 
  He's mine. 
  No, he isn't. 
  Follow. 
  Piss off, son. 
  Anything more than three shakes is a wank. 
  I said, "Piss off. 
  " He has an alibi for the dates of both murders. 
  He's no longer a suspect. 
  That motorway's rotten. 
  - "Sir. 
  " - Sir, it's rotten. 
  The construction company is rotten and all the money is rotten. 
  Then it's a case for Fraud and Corruption, which is where your work has gone. 
  "Gone"? 
  - Sir. 
  - "Sir. 
  " Gone. 
  Very good work. 
  Meticulous but it's not murder and, in my department, we work murder, so your work, your files are gone. 
  Did someone call you? 
  - Sir. 
  - Sir. 
  I get calls all the time, O'Neill. 
  It's part of my job. 
  Look at me, I'm trussed up like a pig's breakfast. 
  I'm going to a reception, I'm giving a keynote speech about policing modern Ireland during a boom time. 
  It's also part of my job. 
  Your job is to follow the evidence and apprehend the killer of Katy Devlin in Knocknaree. 
  Is that understood? 
  Say, "Yes, Sir. 
  " Yes, Sir. 
  - O'Neill? 
  - Yes, Sir. 
  Good. 
  Now you can both piss off. 
  Shane? 
  Shane Waters? 
  I've been looking for you for such a long time. 
  I'm Detective Sergeant Reilly. 
  I'm investigating the death of Katy Devlin at Knocknaree. 
  You're not in any trouble, I promise, but I really need to speak to you, about what happened in the woods in 1985. 
  Can we talk? 
  Because you have no idea how important you are to me. 
  You probably don't know it, but you're the key. 
  We have to talk, let me get you coffee, I'll get you whatever you need, so you, you can talk to me. 
  Adam It's you. 
  What? 
  No. 
  I was so frightened for you. 
  You've got it wrong, you've got it wrong, I'm not So frightened for you. 
  And here you are. 
  Oh, Adam. 
  Adam. 
  Adam, no! 
  No! 
  And what was your objective coming into this house? 
  Into our lives? 
  Attrition, sedition, depose the king. 
  What does that mean? 
  Psychologically destroy you. 
  Set you against each other, tear you apart. 
  Well, you didn't achieve that. 
  You don't understand anything about us at all. 
  My main objective was to find out which one of you murdered Lexie Mangan. 
  Did you know she was pregnant when she was stabbed? 
  When she bled to death. 
  Wasn't she, Abby? 
  She didn't want you to know. 
  Didn't want you upset. 
  Attrition, sedition? 
  You're going to have to work a lot harder than that. 
  - Thank you for thinking of me. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  Don't be sorry. 
  I think it's just sunk in that she's dead. 
  Actually dead. 
  Yeah. 
  Do her family know? 
  We don't know who her family are or where they are. 
  Wouldn't you just look up her name? 
  It wasn't her name. 
  She's a Jane Doe. 
  Lexie Mangan is a name I made up. 
  An identity for a previous assignment. 
  What, so you've done this before? 
  Slink into people's lives like a virus, make them like you, make them trust you? 
  You're a cheat, Detective Maddox. 
  Yeah, I am. 
  You've absolutely nailed me. 
  I'm a cheat. 
  Cheat friends, cheat people who care about me, cheat death. 
  I keep waiting for it catch up with me, but it hasn't. 
  Yet. 
  Oh, is it going to catch up with me tonight, Daniel? 
  Waving my gun around, big man, yourself. 
  We all cheat and lie to make people like us and trust us. 
  And you're the f*cking worst. 
  You needy m*therf*cker. 
  No, he isn't. 
  Oh, come on, look at the people he surrounds himself with. 
  Look at you. 
  Any moment Rafe spends sober is unbearable to him and by the way, you, er, you weren't the father of Lexie's baby. 
  He was. 
  Bollocks was I. 
  DNA tests on the foetus. 
  You're the daddy, Rafe. 
  Not that it matters, it's as dead as she is. 
  It's OK, Rafe. 
  It's OK. 
  Friends share and Lexie made that easy. 
  Friends share? 
  How do you think Abby feels about that? 
  She loves you, Daniel, and you're balls deep in another woman? 
  That's cruel. 
  I don't mind, I understand. 
  I can hear you crying. 
  - No, you can't. 
  - I know Abby loves me, and I love her. 
  We don't own each other. 
  Says the man who owns this house and all the people in it. 
  We all own this house. 
  Until someone tries to leave it. 
  You gave it to them but it's not a gift, it's a noose, tying them to you. 
  These broken children you need to make yourself feel whole. 
  You needy, needy, needy m*therf*cker. 
  Don't talk to him like that! 
  You never told them about the boy you tried to kill when you were 17? 
  Why did you do that? 
  What did he do to you? 
  They don't believe you, Cassie. 
  But keep trying. 
  I told Justin, he didn't seem surprised. 
  Perhaps he knows you've got it in you. 
  Huh? 
  Justin. 
  Justin, it's OK. 
  Hey, I know you're in a lot of pain right now. 
  You have been for a while. 
  Don't know what to think. 
  Tell her how Lexie died. 
  Hm? 
  It's hurting you. 
  I hate when things hurt you. 
  Take her into the kitchen and tell her, OK? 
  I want you to have some peace. 
  OK? 
  It's OK. 
  Go on. 
 
 
 
  I was going to check for Shane. 
  Any luck? 
  Just did, no-one there. 
  I think we need to try other towns, other cities. 
  You want the same alert going out? 
  His name and the road mender's jacket? 
  Well, that's all we've got. 
  Yeah, erm I was getting dinner ready and I told her I knew what she was doing. 
  I knew. 
  That she was selling her part of the house. 
  Leaving us. 
  She ran out of the house and I followed her. 
  I, I didn't even think about still having the knife. 
  I caught her in the alley, and I begged her not to leave and she said I should come with her because I was invisible to all of them. 
  Abby couldn't see anyone but Daniel. 
  Daniel only saw me when I put food in front of him and Rafe only saw me when his cock was in my mouth. 
  Then I I put the knife in her. 
  I didn't, I didn't even realise I'd done it. 
  I just, I just, I want, I wanted her to stop saying it because it was all true. 
  I really miss her. 
  She made me laugh. 
  And there was a baby. 
  Oh, God. 
  Justin, I am not going to abandon you. 
  I'll speak for you in court, it means something, you know. 
  Confessing. 
  I need your help, I need to know who she was. 
  It f*cks with you seeing someone who looks almost exactly like you. 
  How did you meet? 
  No way! 
  Lexie! 
  Justin. 
  We had a couple of seminars together, in first year. 
  Yeah, of course. 
  Justin. 
  Sorry. 
  I heard your parents put you in rehab? 
  It's rough. 
  Yeah, a bit. 
  But clean and serene now, though. 
  So great to see you again. 
  But, she hadn't seen me again, because the Lexie I recognised from the seminars, was you undercover. 
  Yeah. 
  Are you going back to Trinity? 
  If I can. 
  Well, I'm sure you can. 
  Just go to registrations, say, "I'm Lexie Mangan and I'm back, bitches!" Maybe not the "bitches" bit! 
  Justin, the tattoo on her wrist, the circle, what was that about? 
  She said "Only a madwoman or a genius can draw a freehand circle, "take your pick which one I am. 
  " I never wanted to leave her in that cottage. 
  Never. 
  But suddenly everything was decided and cleaned up. 
  Daniel? 
  He said everything would be all right. 
  That we could all go on like normal. 
  But it never was normal and all right. 
  Justin, I need to get you all out of here. 
  Daniel is planning something. 
  Where did he put his grandfather's gun? 
  He said he'd put it somewhere safe. 
  I, I, I think he maybe, might've given it to Abby. 
  He calls her his safe place. 
  Are you feeling better, Justin? 
  Course he is. 
  We're all feeling better. 
  In fact this doesn't need to get messy. 
  No-one needs to panic or leave the country, I mean we were all just trying to protect him. 
  Seriously, you're doing this now? 
  Yes. 
  I'm going with her so I'm tidying up, you're not going to do it, you never do. 
  It was a spur of the moment thing, and we just wanted to protect Justin, he's vulnerable. 
  Daniel, where's the key for the back door? 
  Somewhere. 
  You can't go. 
  I don't want you to. 
  We stick together. 
  That's the pledge we all made to each other. 
  You took an oath. 
  You can't break that now. 
  That's just something you say. 
  No! 
  No, it's not just something I say. 
  It's something we say, we said that and we meant it! 
  You said those words to me! 
  You f*cking said that to me! 
  We said it to each other! 
  The other gun, the old revolver? 
  Have you got it? 
  You shut the f*ck up or you die! 
  You're not going to shoot me! 
  - No? 
  - No. 
  You're going to shoot them. 
  And then yourself. 
  Four bodies, shot with my gun and me left to deal with it. 
  Why did you try to kill that boy at school, Daniel? 
  What had he done to you? 
  He didn't want to be my friend any more. 
  Let him go, let him go, it can just be us, just us two. 
  It doesn't work if it's just us two, it never did. 
  Daniel! 
  Rafe! 
  You crazy b*st*rd! 
  - On your knees! 
  - Stop! 
  Stop! 
  - Put your hands in the air. 
  - Don't move. 
  - Do not move. 
  - Don't struggle, it'll hurt. 
  On your knees. 
  Why did you come here? 
  We were happy until you came here. 
  On the floor! 
  Abby lie on the floor, hands behind your back, eyes closed, don't get up till you're told. 
  Justin, keep her still. 
  Daniel! 
  Daniel! 
  You lied. 
  It's what I do. 
  Drop the weapon. 
  Drop it, Daniel. 
  Drop it, Daniel! 
  Imagine if you and Lexie had met each other. 
  Face-to-face. 
  Do you know what happens when doppelgangers meet each other? 
  The world ends. 
  Put your hands above your head! 
  sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t. 
  Thank you. 
  I knew something was wrong. 
  They're not going to Dublin. 
  I'll process them somewhere more discreet. 
  Because it's a mess. 
  It's not that much of a mess. 
  Bit of a creative spin for your report and it's a roaring success. 
  I made a mistake. 
  I was careless. 
  I should have been more cautious about what I drank, but I wasn't. 
  Well, no-one needs to know that. 
  Creative spin, Cass. 
  Don't send in your report until we've talked, OK? 
  Right, I'll get someone to take you home. 
  Good job, by the way. 
  Nerves of steel, man. 
  Yeah, good job. 
  Peter, Jamie. 
  Peter. 
  Where did you go? 
  Where have you been? 
  Come on, you're always the last. 
  Come on. 
  Keep up, Adam! 
  Run, Adam! 
  Or they'll get you! 
  Wait for me! 
  You never wait! 
  Peter, Jamie! 
  Wait! 
  Peter, Jamie! 
  Come back! 
  Peter, Jamie. 
  Jamie? 
  Peter? 
  Where are you? 
  Come back! 
  Jesus Christ, son, you nearly fell in, come away. 
  You could have drowned. 
  Come home. 
  Come home with me. 
  Wake up, son! 
  For Christ's sake, wake up! 
  You might have glass in your feet. 
  Need to clean them. 
  You should never have gone back to Knocknaree. 
  Telling people you were dead in a car crash, out in the street, shouting their names and your clothes smell of petrol and burning, what have you been doing? 
  What does Cassie say about this? 
  I don't know, she's gone. 
  Gone where? 
  You've done to her what you do to everyone. 
  What do I do? 
  You freeze them out. 
  You go cold. 
  I don't know how it happens. 
  I had this sweet, loving little boy and now you're this cold, cold man. 
  You don't know how it happens? 
  Even when your dad was dying and he wanted you to take his hand and just hold it, hold it while he died, and you couldn't even do that. 
  I don't know you, I don't recognise you, how could you not have held your dad's hand? 
  You put me in a f*cking boarding school in a different country! 
  I didn't know a single f*cking soul and you left me there. 
  You left me there with strangers! 
  How the f*ck do you expect me to be? 
  You sound like an Irishman. 
  We wanted you to have routine. 
  We didn't know what to do. 
  I missed my friends. 
  I missed them. 
  Why do you still worship those kids? 
  They were vicious to you. 
  No, they weren't. 
  Vicious. 
  I hated you playing with them. 
  Your dad said it was just kids being kids and I should cut the apron strings, but I felt sick watching you go off with them. 
  You never liked them because you're a snob. 
  I didn't like them because they were bad kids. 
  Cruel kids, taunting you for being little, always running off and leaving you on your own in those bloody woods! 
  Laughing at you, and you'd come home crying. 
  No, I didn't. 
  I'd beg you to stay home, I tried everything to stop you but you still went, following them like a little puppy. 
  Why would you tell me this? 
  Why would you say this? 
  I don't understand. 
  Because you've remembered it all wrong. 
  You're trapped in it and I don't want you to be trapped. 
  I don't want your life to be ruined, Adam. 
  Don't call me that. 
  PHONE: First new message. 
  Cassie, it's Rob. 
  Come back. 
  I have something I want to tell you. 
  That caravan's freezing, so we've come back. 
  Place is a pig-sty. 
  A disgrace. 
  You should be ashamed. 
  We should have rung to warn you, Daddy. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'll soon have this sorted out. 
  You look funny! 
  We shouldn't have seen that. 
  But we did. 
  The dirty gits. 
  We can use it against them. 
  Have some fun. 
  We saw your hairy arseholes! 
  We saw you doing it, you dirty beasts! 
  Don't! 
  Look at you, want to be at home watching your top 20s with your Mammy, you're no fun. 
  That's your problem, Adam. 
  You're no fun. 
  You're such a waste of skin. 
  Can't leave the place alone, huh? 
  Do you want one? 
  Look like you could do with it. 
  Yeah, thanks. 
  Tanks on the lawn. 
  Can't wait to get started. 
  That's probably the last of those we'll be doing for you. 
  Right. 
  - Did you find what you were looking for? 
  - No. 
  Nor did I. 
  At least we tried. 
  Got to count for something, hasn't it? 
  Trying. 
  Yeah, they're a bit stale. 
  They're fine if you dunk it, though. 
  Advanced digestive process. 
  She's eaten a good five hours before death. 
  And a chocolate biscuit. 
  Initial digestive process. 
  Whose are these, Mark? 
  The biscuits? 
  Damien always brought them. 
  Damien. 
  Always eating, that boy. 
  Hollow legs. 
  Why? 
  Mrs Donnelly is so sick. 
  I don't want her house being taken over till we have to. 
  Why didn't I look? 
  This is how he moved the body. 
  I didn't even look to see if there was a car. 
  Do you want me to start in here? 
  Inside. 
  I know you have your job to do. 
  But you'll find nothing here. 
  It's a mistake. 
  Damien is the best boy in the world, isn't he? 
  We'll do our best not to disturb you. 
  Her clothes had been washed and dried. 
  She'd been kept somewhere. 
  I'm thinking, perhaps? 
  - Ready? 
  - Ready. 
  Oh, Katy. 
  Oh, Christ.
