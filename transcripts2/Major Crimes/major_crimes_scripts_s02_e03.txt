 I hope you're getting everything you need from this, Jason. 
 I am, thanks. 
 It's so great of you guys, letting me ride around like this. 
 It's... it's really gonna help add realism to our scripts. 
 [ Horn honks ] 
 Can't write what you know if you don't know what you write. 
 Ah, wise words, Detective Mike. 
 Ah, Lieutenant... 
 Lieutenant Mike. 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 Sanchez : So, Andrews... 
 [ Alarm chirps ] 
 Uh, call me Jason. 
 So, uh, Andrews, this TV show that you and  Lieutenant  Mike write for... 
 I'm not the writer. 
 I'm the technical advisor. 
 Right... uh,  Lieutenant  Mike is just making sure that we follow rules and regulations and we use police jargon and... okay, so what's this show about? 
 Uh, it's called "badge of justice." 
 And it's about a small team of detectives fighting crime and corruption inside the LAPD. 
 [ Horn honks ] 
 What corruption? 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 Oh, you know, the usual... beating up suspects, planting evidence. 
 Taking bribes, racial profiling. 
 Uh... Jason. 
 Uh, what is it you'd most like to see? 
 Just a normal day. 
 Ha. I'd say about 90% of  our  normal day is paperwork. 
 [ Sirens wailing ] 
 [ Tires screeching ] 
 Our day isn't all that different than what you do. 
 Uh, why aren't we going after that guy? 
 Shouldn't we be in hot pursuit? 
 That guy's not our problem. 
 And don't say "hot pursuit." 
 There are bright red lines of responsibility within the LAPD. 
 Speeding cars are handled by patrol unless it's dangerous. 
 But we usually don't... dispatcher: All units in the vicinity. 
 22-a-47 is in pursuit of a silver Taurus. 
 Possibly armed and dangerous. 
 [ Tires screeching, siren wailing ] 
 Okay, looks like we're gonna have some fun. 
 There they are. 
 Tao : Clear! 
 [ Tires screeching ] 
 The most important thing to remember about a high-speed chase... 
 [ Gun cocks ] ...Is safety first. 
 Clear. 
 [ Sirens wailing ] 
 [ Tires screeching, horn blaring ] 
 Uh, Detective Sanchez, if it's safety first... 
 Clear! ...Shouldn't you be wearing your seatbelt? 
 No. Clear! 
 Clear! 
 It's, like, the law, though, right? 
 Look. If somebody shoots at us, I want to get out of the car. 
 Maybe jump out of the way. 
 Seatbelts can get you killed. 
 Don't do that. 
 Why not? 
 If you hurt yourself during a crash, we have liability issues. 
 But if you get shot, we're off the hook 'cause you signed a release. 
 [ Sirens wailing, tires screeching ] 
 So until this chase is over... and the way this guy is driving, that shouldn't take too long... 
 I want you to slump down in your seat... 
 [ tires screeching ] 
 Clear! 
 Good. We got him! 
 See? Easy as that. 
 [ Tires screeching ] 
 Get out of the car! 
 Man : Do it! Do it now! 
 Stay there until I wave for you. 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 Throw your keys out and get on the ground now! 
 Get your hands in the air! 
 Do it now! 
 Do it now! 
 Get out of the car! 
 Man : Get out of the car. 
 Man #2 : Put your hands where we can see them! 
 Get on the ground! 
 Get out of the car. Slowly. 
 No sudden moves. 
 Stand up straight! 
 Put your hands on your head. 
 Put your hands on your head! 
 Turn around! Slowly! 
 Turn around. 
 Get on the ground! 
 All right. 
 Keep your hands behind your head! 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 What's your name? Are you hurt? 
 Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you! 
 Where did all this blood come from? 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 Sanchez : Are you hurt? 
 What did you people do to him? 
 Tao : He was like that when we found him. 
 Blood's nearly dry. See? 
 I asked you a question! 
 Where is all this blood from? 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 The guy's not hurt at all. 
 So what's with all the blood? 
 It's what we call a clue, Jason. 
 Excuse me. 
 [ Dog barks ] 
 Officer cotty, why did you give chase? 
 Suspect took a corner, clipped the curb, and the lid to his trunk popped off. 
 We tried to pull him over just to say, "hey, you dropped something." 
 Then we saw he was covered in blood. 
 Any ID on him? 
 No, sir. 
 No wallet, no phone. 
 Just an extra set of these. 
 So, he has two sets of keys. 
 Well, these belong to a Range Rover. 
 Anything on this vehicle? 
 Registered to a Rosa Vega, living in east L.A. 
 Not a code 37 or a code 6 Charles. 
 Thanks. 
 What's that mean? 
 Those codes? 
 It means the car has not been reported stolen... Yet. 
 Whose blood is this? 
 If this blood belongs to someone who's still alive and they die while you're standing here... 
 You have a wife? Huh? 
 I'm going to arrest her. 
 You have a dog?! 
 I'm gonna kill it! 
 [ Sighs ] He probably doesn't even have a dog. 
 Whose blood is this?! 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 Whoever this Mr. Blood is, his prints didn't turn up in AFIS, so I'm guessing no criminal record. 
 And when I called the DMV for a thumbprint match for an ID, nothing. 
 And this Rosa Vega, who the vehicle is registered to? 
 Legal resident alien. 
 Been in the U.S. for about eight years. 
 No criminal record, and her car still has not been reported stolen. 
 Which means Mrs. Vega doesn't know her vehicle is missing, or she lent it to Mr. Blood here, or... or it was  her   blood on our suspect. 
 Has anyone been in contact with Mrs. Vega? 
 Tao : No, we've been trying to call her. 
 Flynn and Provenza are on their way to her residence now. 
 These are Mr. Blood's clothes. 
 There is no Abercrombie & Fitch in Mexico. 
 The sunglasses are Oliver peoples, and he's got an expensive haircut. 
 He could be living here, but he has a lot of Mexican tattoos. 
 Maybe he's in the U.S. because he's wanted in Mexico. 
 That  theory's good enough to get the FBI involved. 
 You're totally profiling that guy. 
 Excuse me, Mr... Andrews. 
 Mr. Andrews, you are not recording this. 
 Oh, is that not okay? 
 Buzz : Without our permission? 
 No, it's not okay. 
 I got this, Buzz. 
 Mr. Andrews, this is an ongoing investigation. 
 Lieutenant Mike said there's no expectation of privacy in a police station. 
 It was a story point in episode two of his series. 
 Suspects have no expectation of privacy. 
 I do. Your phone, please. 
 Special Agent Fritz Howard, please. 
 Do you even know if that blood has human DNA? 
 Contrary to what you see on television, it takes more than an hour to get the results on DNA. 
 But serum tests are back, and the blood on the suspect's clothes is definitely human. 
 Oh, sure. 
 Special Agent Howard is out of the office. 
 They transferred me to Morris. 
 You want me to hold on? 
 Yes, I might need him. 
 So, now you can arrest this guy? 
 For what? He's covered in human blood. 
 Which is not a crime. 
 But he left his trunk lid in the street... littering. 
 Reckless driving, and without a license. 
 And perhaps he didn't use his signal when turning. 
 Three or more moving violations while refusing to pull over. 
 That's felony evasion. 
 Great idea, captain. 
 God, Amy. 
 Hey! Captain. 
 What? I-I can't take notes either? 
 Mr. Andrews, what part of ongoing investigation do you not understand? 
 The LAPD gave me permission to observe Lieutenant Mike at work. 
 Right, and Lieutenant Mike is going to let you observe somewhere else. 
 Of course, ma'am. 
 Come on, Jason. 
 This is pretty cool. 
 I'm on hold with the FBI. 
 Uh... Jason. 
 Oh. Uh... Amy. 
 Sanchez : [  Speaking Spanish  ] 
 One last time. 
 Did you do something Rosa Vega? Did you do something to her? Where is she? Tell me where she is! [ Horn honks ] Hey, hey. Don't bring that. This new cleanse can't get too hot. It's in an insulated thermos. You can't undo 50 years of treating your body like a science experiment with a cleanse. Do us all a favor. Eat a hot dog. Yeah, well, I'm not a quitter. Is it too late? Is she dead? [ Knock on door ] Mrs. Vega? LAPD. Are you there? There was a lot of blood on your clothes. It's been hours. Is it over? Is she dead? If she's dead, we're going to find her. You know that, right? Wait, I-I see something. Help make things right for this lady. Yeah! There's movement! Tell me what you did, and I will help you straighten out this mess. [ Screams ] Mrs. Vega, LAPD. Are you all right, ma'am? What's happened? Abogado. "Abogado" means that... I know, Buzz. He wants an attorney. Provenza : It wasn't the car owner's blood. So who did he kill? [ Door opens ] Agent Morris, thank you for coming so quickly. Well, I shouldn't have. In case you didn't know, print matches can be faxed to my office. I send them to the Mexican consulate, and within three hours, you'd have this guy's record. If he has one. He does. How can you be so sure? He knew exactly how to get out of his car so we wouldn't shoot him, and he didn't wreck his vehicle. And he won't talk to us, so he's either deaf or very smart. In addition to Mexico, you may want to check with the consulates in Central America and Brazil. Maybe the Arab Peninsula, too. You never know. What are you talking about? Our suspect was covered in human blood. We need to make certain he isn't a part of some terrorist plot. And that's really more  yours  specialty than ours. Seriously? Yeah. Captain, the public defender's here. Thank you, Detective. Oh, I get it. You're calling him a potential terrorist so I can monitor him with his lawyer. The national security interests of the United States trump attorney/client privilege. Better safe than sorry. Man, does Fritz Howard have you people spoiled. Okay. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Always a delight, Morris. Always a delight. David. How are you? Fine, captain. I appreciate the call. Well, we like to bring in professionals we know will do the right thing. Right. Detective Sykes explained the situation to me. We are at felony evading. Is that all? So far, but if there is a person out there whose blood matches the human blood we found on your client's clothes, and that person is still alive, David... okay, okay. Before you go on about exigent circumstances, let me hear my client's side of the story. Of course. Detective Sykes, will you please show Mr. Ahmed to his client. Yes, ma'am. Right this way. [ Sighs ] Ahmed? That's the best we could do? Well, his father is retired LAPD. And he's better than most. Hey. Does anybody have a minute? I'm in the middle of a huge crisis. Does this crisis involve another threatening letter? Uh, no. Look... we were ordered to write this practice essay for our college-entrance application, and my English teacher completely tore mine apart. Rusty, that doesn't exactly sound like a crisis to me. You haven't read the essay. Oh, no. Well, I don't really have time to look at it right now. Sorry, Rusty. Whoa, whoa, whoa... if I'm really gonna monitor your suspect's conversation with his attorney, I can't let you back in here. But... You'll need a translator. [ Speaking Spanish ] Unless any of you speak Arabic or Farsi? But my equipment. I have to monitor... adios. I'm pretty sure that's a civil rights violation... uh, listening to that guy talk with his lawyer. Hmm. Actually, Shakespeare, it's not. We are following the law. And if you don't believe me, you can look it up. Want to help him out, Mike? He's  your  friend. "Providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001." Otherwise known as the patriot act. "Patriot's" an acronym? Oh, yeah. Someone was very proud the day they thought of it. [ Cellphone vibrating ] It gives government agencies the right to surveil all criminal activities if they suspect terrorism. Provenza. Uh-huh. Yes, Mrs. Vega. Yes, ma'am. We're gonna get your car back to you as soon as we can. Mm-hmm. What are you doing, Julio? In addition to the Taurus, our suspect had the keys to a range rover. I'm checking to see how many of them were stolen recently. Meanwhile, we could be saving someone's life, and we are standing here doing nothing. So, as I was saying, I have to do this practice essay over again just because, in sister Mary's dumb opinion, my subject was "inappropriate." And she gave me the topic herself! "Write about the person in your life who has influenced you the most." I proofed it. Just read the first line. Okay. "From the day I finally learned to tie my shoes, "the person who has exercised the most influence in my life is me." Mm. What? It's true. Don't you think your mom maybe had some influence, too? She's not my mom. And who are you anyway? This is Jason. He's a TV writer. Oh, what show? Uh, it's not on yet. Anyway, yes, yes, my essay is a little edgy for nuns, but I was supposed to write about my life, and that is what I did. Rusty, this essay makes you sound arrogant and conceited. Arrogant? You are rewriting it. Sharon, I was literally just... oh, no, I'm sorry. You want to keep your laptop and your cellphone? You can't take my things away from me. They are not your things. They are  my  things. And you can only keep them while making mature decisions. Which, in this case, means following the instructions of your teacher. Sure she's not your mom? This is so completely unfair. You're not using the word "influence" properly. Do you, uh... do you have a dictionary laying around? Yeah, yeah. There's one back here. [ Computer beeps ] We've got something. A Range Rover was stolen this morning in North L.A. Captain? You are no longer facing exigent circumstances, and your suspect is not a terrorist. May I ask how the bureau can be so sure of that? The FBI has no intel linking terrorists with a chop shop in Northridge. Somewhere near Chapel Street. Might be a good place to start looking for our range rover. [ Alarm chirps ] Julio. I smell a chop shop. Buzz, you hang back a little. Flynn : Hold my cleanse. [ Door creaks ] Hey! [ Tapping ] [ Machinery whirring ] [ Whirring stops ] There's nobody here! All clear, Buzz! Someone left in a hurry. Oh, God. Lieutenant Provenza, I think this is blood. More over here. Whoa. There's drag marks here, too. Oh. [ Groans ] [ Coughs ] Take a second, Buzz. Go ahead. Take a second. Holy hell. Stiff in the middle... that's Jose Garza. Goes by "Pepito." This guy steals drugs from other gangs and deals them around night clubs. Was not a good guy. Flynn : But if this was gang-related, these guys would have been all shot up. Instead of cut open with their insides pouring out. [ Cellphone vibrates ] Provenza. Sharon : Lieutenant, good news. Mr. Ahmed has informed me that his client is willing to talk with us. Well, that's great, captain. Because we have a whole lot of new questions we'd like to ask him. That's what you told me. Plus a few embellishments for production value. 
 
 Um... Sorry about... Your mom and... and stuff. Seems like a tough time. Yeah, yeah. My mom was, um... Wow. Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is exactly what I need! Thank you, but do you mind if I just rewrite it a little bit so that it sounds more like me? That's what my boss does. Sure. Do what you want with it. Man, that was fast, too. I don't know how to thank you, man. Uh, you could tell me if Amy is single. Or dating. Amy? Detective Sykes. Oh  that  Amy. Uh, well, she's not married. Dating, I guess I could find out for you. [ Knock on door ] While the captain and Sanchez are interviewing our suspect, Lieutenant tao asked if you'd like to meet him at the print shed. Yeah, what's a "print shed"? Oh, it's where we examine cars like the one our suspect was driving. I can take you if you want. Oh, but, watch it, Amy. Your boyfriend might get mad if he finds you hanging out with someone good-looking like Jason. [ Chuckles ] What are you talking about? I don't have a boyfriend. [ Chuckles ] The world according to teenagers. [ Chuckles ] Uh, so... Print shed. I'm in. Also, I want to remind you that the admission my client will be making... Flynn : Don't worry, Hobbs. As soon as his attorney shuts up, the guy's gonna confess. [ Cellphone vibrates ] No one was in the vehicle  at the time. The keys had been left  in the open... Provenza. Oh, yes, Mrs. Vega. I assure you that... yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, I will get your car back to you just as soon as we can. Bye-bye. Woman is driving me crazy. What are you so upset for? She wants her car back. I'm not upset about that. I'm upset that you ran out of business cards and I had to give her one  mine. As they have in ours. Ahmed : My client's name is Juan Diaz. He steals cars, delivers them to a chop shop, and helps strip the vehicles of whatever is valuable. You were there this morning, Mr. Diaz? At the chop shop? Sí. Yes. I work in the pit. This morning, I-I-I did what we all do... I stole a car. This one from outside a Starbucks, and then I drove it to work. I parked it down the street to make sure that I wasn't being followed. Then I... I went inside to take apart what was already in the garage... the Taurus. I was standing in the pit when... when I heard some... some yelling and... and... and screaming. They were fighting. Did you recognize the voice? No. No. So, what did you do after the yelling? I started to climb out, and then... and then somebody just fell on top of me, bleeding everywhere. And then... and then another body fell in, and... and... and another body. And I... I hid underneath them. What were their names? What? What were the names of the men who fell on top of your client? You work with them, Juan. What were their names? I don't know their real names. Okay, we weren't friends! I didn't ask who they were, they didn't ask about me. All I know is these guys were bleeding when they were thrown on top of me. And if I wouldn't have hid, I would be dead, too. So you stayed in the pit until...? Until I felt it was safe. [ Voice breaking ] I looked around to make sure that no one was alive, and I climbed out and... and got into the car we were taking apart and... and drove away. Why did you run from the police when you knew there were bodies in the garage? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you understand how horrific these circumstances were? Juan was afraid. He was covered in blood in a stolen car, in the country illegally. Look... he's already been through hell. He committed no serious crime, and he is more than willing to self-deport. [ Crying ] I just want to go back home. Please. I want to go back home. [ Door closes ] I've heard nothing inconsistent from the evidence we found at the crime scene. As far as I can tell, your suspect is not only a victim, but a witness... to a triple homicide. And he might be seriously traumatized. When we pulled him over, he looked okay to me. Well, he could be suffering from shock. His explanation covers what we know. Okay, what about something that Juan doesn't know? Like the names of the three victims. And why did he drive off in a Taurus if he had a range rover outside? Why was he working with gangbangers dressed up like he was going to Beverly Hills? This story, ma'am, is not credible. But the identity of at least one of the victims does mesh with this version of events. Pepito Garza stole drug shipments from several gangs. He had a death wish. Maybe one of the cartels is involved. Okay, what was Pepito doing in a chop shop? Okay, I'll tell you, this  Juan  is involved in drugs. Then find me some evidence to prove it. Or find me the killer. And maybe we can get your bloody friend some protection as a witness. Might want to hold off on that. Your suspect may not have a record in the U.S., but he's got one in Mexico. Manuel Luis Vega Aguilar. His name's not Juan. Manuel Luis. He's a liar. And he's wanted for drug racketeering. His prints set off alarms with the federales. Mexico has an arrest warrant out for him. And they're asking for him back, asap. Yeah, he offered to self-deport. He wants to go home because he's cartel and he can bribe himself out. Manuel Luis  Vega  Aguilar. Vega. What am I missing? In Latin countries, children retain the last names of both their parents. His father's last name is Aguilar and his mother's last name is Vega. It was her Taurus he was driving. And Mrs. Vega is  very  interested in getting that Taurus back. She's called me five times already. If Julio is right... I am. And our suspect is cartel... He is. Then instead of just printing the Taurus, we need to completely take it apart. Why? What are you looking for? Tao : Black tar heroin. And a lot of it. Probably close to $3 million worth. Hollowing out the dashboard. The show could use that. But doesn't border patrol check for things like this with drug dogs and electronic sniffers? Well, with the amount of cars coming in and out of Mexico each day, not every one can be checked. This is an inconspicuous vehicle. It's mostly large cars, SUVs, and vans that are pulled aside and searched. And these dryer sheets wrapped up in the heroin disguise the smell. It's not 100%. But if the dog doesn't get in the car, it works. [ Chuckles ] This passenger side airbag has been removed. Nothing but heroin. This is great! I mean, you know, from a story standpoint. So, what's next? Provenza : Mrs. Vega, sorry it took so long to get your vehicle back to you. Oh. You don't know how worried I was. Do you know if anything got stolen out of it? Well, you'd be a better judge of that than us, ma'am. [ Brake clicks ] [ Engine shuts off ] We're all set, Julio. We're all set, Mrs. Vega. Sign here, ma'am, please. Gracias. Okay, so, if there's anything else we can do, you have Lieutenant Provenza's number. Yes. Thank you. [ Engine turns over ] We got her. Mrs. Vega has taken the bait. Man : Copy that. Heading in. Mrs. Vega? Just one more thing. You're under arrest. Step out. Turn around and face the car. Rosa Vega, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you by the state. Have you heard and understood these rights as they have been read to you, ma'am? [ Laughs ] Wow! It worked! That's... That Amy is... is really tough. Hey, what do you think about me maybe coming in tomorrow, just to see you guys finish up? Tomorrow? Why not? This new essay is very well done. I can't believe you wrote all those wonderful things about me. Thanks. I just, you know, focused on what's important in my life. [ Inhales deeply ] No. I can't believe  you  wrote all those things. This essay sounds nothing like you at all. Yes, it does. It's me. I mean, it's... it's mostly me. I had a little help from that Jason guy. But look, Sharon. It's all about how important you are. I don't want to be the subject of an essay that someone else helped you write. This feels like cheating. And I'm not the most important influence in your life. Whoa, okay, first, I did not cheat. It's my story. Jason only helped me with the organization and the wording. Well, we'll ask your teacher if that qualifies as your story and I'll go with her decision. And secondly, you have to be the biggest influence, Sharon, because if I say ithe biggest influence, then everyone tells me I'm a huge egomaniac. Which we know is not true. And I live with you. So, you're the influence. But why do you live with me, Rusty? That's the question you need to ask. So, what you're saying is that I have to write this essay all over again. You do. But think about this, influences can be both bad and good at the same time. My son's an idiot. And that's the truth. He's not smart enough to smuggle drugs past you people. Well, we're not so sure about that because your little Taurus seemed to be pretty well-designed. Enough so that it could carry $3 million worth of heroin across the border. If he did that, my son really  is  an idiot. Stopping at a Starbucks to drink coffee? With a car with all that heroin in it? That is so stupid, I can't even think about it. How could she know that? The suspect had no phone when you found him. He must have tossed it during the chase. I'll find it. Okay. Why is that important? It means our suspect was in contact with his mother after her car was stolen. She knew what he was doing. Maybe pushed him to do it. Flynn :  ...What we want to know, the longer you're gonna sit here. Okay. This is the story. And it's never going to change. We didn't know anything about the heroin in that car. Provenza : [ Chuckles ] Well, that's curious, because you knew exactly where to look for it. It wasn't heroin that I pulled out of my car. It was molding clay that you put there. I was never in possession of any illegal drugs. You can't arrest me for that. You sound like an attorney. I am an attorney. In Mexico. But I've studied your laws, too, But we have plenty against your son. He murdered three people in a chop shop. I don't believe you. He didn't do that. Why would he do that? Trying to get your drugs back. Trying to get my  car  back, you mean. And if that's true, Manuel had every right to kill those people. And what makes you think that? If he was fighting to regain his own property, it's not murder. Ahmed : It's self-defense. My client had a right to pursue his mother's car. He wasn't going after the car, he was going after his heroin. The law doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal property. Anything Manuel did fighting to get his car back is considered self-defense. Hobbs : It wasn't his car. It was registered under his mother's name. A distinction without a difference. He was driving the Taurus with Rosa Vega's permission. If the thieves fought him when he tried to get his car back... and you have no evidence to the contrary... that makes all three of these deaths justifiable homicides. Is that for real? As much as I hate to say so, yes. If he says that the guys in the chop shop tried to stop him, then... [ Sighs ] He was fighting for his narcotics. If you can prove they belonged to him, yes, captain, he's allowed to fight back, his property is his property. Even if it's contraband. So, we'll plead guilty to borrowing a Range Rover and call it a day. Ahmed, it's three counts of second-degree murder. That's the best it's ever gonna get. And that deal has a clock on it. You want to talk about clocks? By my calculations, you have less than 24 hours till habeas corpus kicks in. I'm ready for arraignment right now. Let's find a judge, see what happens. [ Door slams ] Drug possession? And illegally "borrowing" a car? Ahmed was right. If Manuel protected himself trying to take back the Taurus, that's self-defense. And with Manuel's mother corroborating his story, we can't even hold her much longer. Jason : Well, you could have, if you had put the heroin back in the car instead of the clay. Tao : That would have been illegal. We're not allowed to monkey around with controlled substances like heroin. So she walks? How is that possible? Captain, what should we do with our newest candidate for mother of the year? Mrs. Vega seems to be the brains of this outfit. I wonder if the federales are interested  her. I thought you guys were worried that if we sent them back to Mexico the cartel would bribe your suspect out of jail. He wanted to self-deport. That was before we found the heroin. Manuel thought that we would give the car back to his mother. Now we've got the drugs, they don't. Mother and son may prefer to avoid their cartel friends. After losing $3 million worth of heroin? Can you imagine the welcome they would get back in Mexico? I'm guessing no parades. Do we have prints on Mrs. Vega? In case she's wanted under another name? We'll get them for you in a moment. He threw his phone out before he turned onto the cul-de-sac where we caught him. Interesting texts with mama. What's it say? He messaged her before he went inside the chop shop, and she texted back, "don't come home without..." Rosa : "The car and everything in it." "Now they know who we are. Before you leave, make sure that they don't bother us again." This isn't an order to execute anyone. Mrs. Vega, the DA has authorized me to say that if you give up the names of your business partners, we will work with you on sentencing. Provenza : Look, we'll hold your son in America for his crimes instead of sending him back to Mexico. Which, if you don't help us, we will do. If you have to send him to Mexico, send him to Mexico. That's his problem. You still have no evidence against me. Tonight, tomorrow, eventually, you will let me go. That's how it works. Mrs. Vega, I don't think you understand what we're saying here. If your boy goes back to Mexico... yes, it's a little sad. But Manuel has made mistakes that he's gonna have to pay for. Look, the answer to your problems is staring you in the face, and we all know it. Hand my son over to the federales. And let justice be done. [ Footsteps ] You can't do this. Can't do what, Ahmed? Send my client back to Mexico. This is the imposition of the death penalty by other means. It's a crime against everything we stand for and our legal system. Let me help you with this. I'm prepared to make a deal. Three counts murder one, life without parole. In exchange, Manuel tells me everything I want to know about his mother's drug operation. Or we can give your client a little going-away fiesta. I'll even bring the piñata. He'll never talk about his mother. Oh, yes he will. Or what? Or what's about to happen to Mrs. Vega will happen to him. We ran her prints. Your client's mother is wanted by Mexico, as well. But before she goes, perhaps she'll provide her son with a good example for once. No! No! You can't do this! I haven't done anything! Please! Oh! You don't understand! They'll have me killed! No! Don't! Please don't send me back! Please! No! No! Please! They'll kill me! Please! Please don't send me back! Please! Please don't send me back! So, here's our new offer. Your client gives us his statement of facts, wherein he admits to sneaking up on the victims and killing them in order to get his heroin back. Or... He follows the good mother to Mexico. Which is it, David? I'll take life. Served here. My God. [ Door closes ] 90% paperwork. 10% other stuff. This was the other stuff. Car chases, guys covered in blood, heroin, evil mothers. Not our normal day-to-day. I forgot to say how nice it was to meet you, Amy. Oh. Well... Nice to meet you, too. And good luck with your show. Oh. Thanks. Uh... Hey, do... do you have a card or something? I mean, would... would it be okay if I called you? I-I t-think it'd be nice to... to talk to you sometime if you ever have a minute. Sure. Call me. Whenever you want. With questions. Right... questions. I will. And, uh... Thanks. Sure. [ Thermos clangs ] Rusty : "As my mother drifted further and further away" "under the influence of crack and finally disappeared, "in a curious contradiction of our circumstances, "her effect on the choices I make has only increased. "I sometimes wonder "why she could not choose me over using drugs, "but I will never wonder if I will do that to other people. "And I won't run away from my problems again, "no matter how threatening they may seem. "These are the lessons my mother taught me, even as she failed to learn them herself." That was very good. Very you. For better or for worse. Oh. For better. Very, very much better.
