 woman : Aaaaah! 
 Operator : 911. What's your emergency? 
 Reichman : Please... please send help! 
 Please! 
 Somebody broke into my house! 
 He stabbed my wife! 
 Oh, my God! 
 There's blood everywhere! 
 [ Sirens wailing ] 
 [ Fire engine horns honk ] 
 I missed my flight. 
 [ Camera shutter clicking ] 
 When I drove home from the airport, I noticed that the lights were off. 
 I came in through the garage. 
 Called out for Elaine. 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 I saw a man running out of the house. 
 Can you describe this man? 
 It was dark. 
 I couldn't see his face. 
 He ran out the back door. 
 Must have forced Elaine to open the safe. 
 Why did he have to kill her? 
 He had what he wanted. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Mr. Reichman, how did you cut your hand? 
 Maybe when I pulled the knife out of Elaine. 
 It was stuck in her chest. 
 I thought I could save her. 
 Where was your daughter during all this? 
 Asleep... 
 I hope. 
 Lydia : I heard mommy and daddy fighting again. 
 They woke me up, and I came downstairs. 
 How could you see with the lights off? 
 I'm a girl scout. 
 I keep a flashlight under my bed in case there's an earthquake. 
 Lydia... 
 What did you see when you went downstairs? 
 [ Echoing ] 
 So much blood. 
 And when he stopped, he still had the knife in his hand. 
 And mommy wasn't moving anymore. 
 Judge Black : Have you reached a verdict? 
 Kane : We have, your honor. 
 Mr. Reichman, would you please stand and face the jury? 
 Mrs. Kane. 
 We the jury in the above-entitled action find the defendant, William Reichman... 
 Guilty of first-degree murder of Elaine Reichman. 
 [ Spectators murmuring ] 
 I'm innocent. 
 So said December 3, 2004. 
 No, I'm... I'm... 
 I'm innocent! 
 No. No, wait. 
 This is wrong. 
 I'm innocent! 
 I'm innocent! 
 Judge Black : Order in the court! 
 Wait, wait! I'm innocent! Order! 
 Ladies and gentlemen, order in this court! 
 All rise. 
 Court is now in session. 
 The honorable Judge Richwood presiding. 
 Please turn and face the flag. 
 All : I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
 Judge Richwood : Please be seated. 
 Good morning. 
 All right, I have read the witness's new statement. 
 I've studied your briefs. 
 I'm now ready to hear final arguments on the motion to overturn Mr. Reichman's conviction. 
 D.D.A. Meeks. 
 Your honor, we've only had 60 days to follow up on this newly discovered blood evidence. 
 Excuse me, your honor. 
 This blood is not new. 
 It was there the whole time. 
 The police just didn't bother to process it. 
 We just put our hands over our hearts and recited the words "with liberty and justice for all." 
 This man... this innocent man... has been deprived of both liberty and justice for 8 1/2 years. 
 He lost his architectural firm and his standing in his profession. 
 Mr. Reichman has always maintained his innocence. 
 He has always maintained that there was an intruder in the house. 
 After the only witness, a 10-year-old child, recanted, the police finally agreed to DNA-test all the blood. 
 Guess what. 
 There  was  someone else in the house. 
 He bled, he fled, he has a criminal record, and is wanted by the FBI. 
 All right, gentlemen, approach. 
 Lieutenant, you, too. 
 Why on earth didn't you test these blood samples in 2004? 
 We ran DNA on the blood found near the victim's body. 
 This sample was taken from the other side of the house, near the kitchen sink, where Mr. Reichman said he washed his hands after cutting himself on the murder weapon. 
 He thought the blood was his. 
 When I see an area like this, that hasn't been checked, I assume it's either purposeful or negligent. 
 Meeks : All we're looking for is 30 more days to find the person this DNA belongs to and determine to what extent, if any... 
 My client shouldn't spend another minute in custody... He was involved in the murder. 
 That's enough. 
 Step back. 
 At least give us a chance to refile if new information arises. 
 Step back. 
 Will the defendant please rise and face the bench? 
 Mr. Reichman, I am... 
 Floored by what has happened here today. 
 Officially, your nightmare is over. 
 The state of California owes you a profound apology, sir, and I'm hereby dismissing this case with prejudice. 
 [ Indistinct conversations, light applause ] 
 [ Metal detector beeping ] 
 Woman : Mr. Corbett, a moment of your time? 
 Excuse me, miss Reichman? 
 I'm Amy Sykes from "Live at 5." 
 Would you listen to an on-air apology from the police officer who arrested your father almost nine years ago? 
 Detective Tao? 
 It's Lieutenant Tao now. 
 Buzz, are we ready to roll? 
 We are rolling. 
 Lydia, I am so sorry about what happened to your father. 
 I know you were probably trying to do your job, and it might have looked like he was guilty, but you manipulated me into testifying against my own father. 
 I didn't manipulate you, Lydia. 
 I was only trying to help you remember. 
 That's enough. 
 Turn off the camera. 
 Lydia, please, please! 
 Lydia... 
 I screwed up the case. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Maybe I didn't dig deep enough into what you were saying back then because I didn't want to traumatize you. 
 I was only 10. 
 You asked the questions and fed me the answers. 
 Please. 
 Watch the recording of our initial interview and see if you still think I acted in bad faith. 
 Are you still trying to turn me against my dad? 
 Absolutely not. 
 The judge ruled your father can't be tried for this murder again. 
 He's effectively not guilty, which means someone else killed your mom, and you're still a witness to her murder. 
 You know I researched what was on TV that night. 
 April 3, 2004. 
 And I remembered watching a scary movie about a man who murdered his wife. 
 That's what made me say all those terrible things about my dad. 
 I was just a kid. 
 Watch this recording. 
 Please. 
 It may trigger a memory that could help me, help your mom. 
 Please. 
 [ Sighs She's sticking to her new story like she did to her old story. Lieutenant, how did this case go so upside down? 8 1/2 years ago, it cost about $1,000 per DNA test. We took over 200 samples from the crime scene. We had a trial budget of 50 grand. So we chose 25 blood samples, and the defense chose their 25. There wasn't much blood found in the kitchen, and Reichman thought it was his. It's a brutal scene. Whoever attacked Mrs. Reichman... And that would be Mr. Reichman. Stabbed her in the neck by the door to the master bedroom. She fought back. Stabbed her again. She crawled into the front room, trying to get out the sliding glass door. He pulled her by the hair, slit her throat, stabbed her in the chest four more times. Overkill. Passionate. Personal. Sanchez : He attacked her with enough force to break the tip off the knife. Did you find the tip in Mrs. Reichman's body? No. The knife, according to the suspect... it was taken from their kitchen, by the way... was already broken. It matched up to every wound in the victim's body. Provenza : Not to mention Reichman bought a big roll of plastic, some cement, and a shiny new shovel one week before his wife's murder. Which he claimed was for the yard. He also claimed to give his daughter a sleeping pill. Sleeping pill? For a 10-year-old? Reichman said, whenever he went away on business, the daughter became hysterical. Helping her nod off was his wife's idea. Mike tested the little girl's cocoa and found Ambien in it. Now, the kid fell asleep before she finished it. Otherwise, she wouldn't have woken up in time to catch her father with that knife in his hand. The defense was right. I never gave any credence to the intruder theory. I always thought the husband did it from the get-go. Because he's guilty as hell. How can you be so sure, Lieutenant? Three good reasons, Sykes... it's always the husband. It's always the husband. It's always the husband. Sharon : Lieutenant Provenza, that is exactly what Mr. Reichman's civil attorney will want you to say while he's suing this department for millions of dollars in damages. What was Mr. Reichman's alibi, Lieutenant Tao? He arrived at the airport late, got stuck in a long security line, and missed his flight. Here's Mr. Reichman staring directly into an L.A.X. security camera at 12:04 A.M. Who looks directly into a security camera? Hey, look, I can give him a break there. Sometimes you can't see those cameras. He left airport parking at 12:16 A.M. And reported the murder at 22 minutes after 1:00. Sanchez : What, leaving, like, an hour and change to drive all the way to silver lake? Plus, cut the power, stage a break-in, kill his wife, and call 911? I drove from L.A.X. to the crime scene dozens of times. Varied the route, speed. That late at night, it took me anywhere from 35 to 45 minutes, which would have given Reichman a window of 21 to 31 minutes. Flynn : Plenty of time to commit murder. It all fits. Except the part where he turns out to be innocent eight years after I sent him to prison. Mike, Mike, you got to stop beating yourself up. The guy did it. He outfoxed the system somehow. Tell me about our new alternate suspect, Lieutenant. The DNA says he's a wanted embezzler named Benito "Benny" Zapata. He's lived and worked in Colorado Springs. Last-known whereabouts? The crime scene, I guess. Lieutenant Provenza, let's start looking for Mr. Zapata right now and contact our FBI liaison, since they seem to want him, too. Lieutenant Tao, I would like to watch the initial interview that you did with Mr. Reichman's daughter. I heard angry voices. Mom screamed. Someone ran out of the house. I thought daddy was gone again. But I could still hear noises, like grunting and groaning sounds. So I got my flashlight and I went downstairs, and that's when I saw my daddy with the knife. What was he doing with the knife? Hurting mommy. Hurting her how? Can you show me? Like this. Lydia, your daddy said he was pulling the knife out. Is that possible? Pulling it out and putting it in. It made noises. Did you see anyone else in the house? Are you sure? Just mommy and daddy. Why did you give this DVD to my daughter? After all we've been through. Haven't you done enough damage already? [ Knock on door ] Reichman:  Instead of dragging my daughter back through this,  why don't you talk to me? Where's Sharon? I'll tell you anything you want to know. Lieutenant Provenza, do you know how to knot a tie? You're seriously asking this guy for advice on a tie? Yeah. Why not? He's been wearing 'em for a hundred years. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Give me that thing. Can you man the ship? Aye-aye. Let me. Do you want a windsor or a half-windsor? What's the difference? What's the occasion? Oh, well, my sperm donor is taking me and Sharon out to dinner. I thought you didn't want to meet your biological father. I'm calling him "Mr. Dunn." Uh, chin up, please. And it shouldn't come as a surprise to you, but I can be bought. The suit is a bribe. A bribe? Well, Sharon bought me this suit to bribe me into having dinner with the donor. I've never had a suit before... or a tie, and I got to pick it out myself, so I figured, you know, I should break it in. Looks good. This must be some fancy restaurant, huh? Yeah, it's like "Trat-o-ria Spo-leeto" or something like that... I don't know. But it's not gonna be about the meal. They have a great marinara. No, I mean, Mr. Dunn is gonna be on the hot seat tonight. I've got, like, 47 questions to ask him. Good God, you're not kidding. "Number 12... which would you pay me more to do... live with you or stay away from you?" Yeah, that one may say number 12, but really, it's like number 1 or 2. Definitely an up-front question. "Why should I believe you never knew about me?" Rusty, you don't need these questions. The man is blood, okay? You sit down, you look him in the eye, and then you give the man the benefit of the doubt. No, but he should be on the defensive, not me. Rusty, this is not chess. No one needs to be on the defensive. You listen to me, young man. You got out there tonight and have a good time. Hey, Buzz, a little red light just came on. Is it flashing or is it steady? Um, steady? N-no, flashing. Leaving you in charge of the  Titanic. So... Do I look more mature? Yeah. Sure you do. Why all these questions  about my daughter  after nearly a decade? Sharon  we're just trying to understand why Lydia changed her statement. How about, she finally grew old enough to understand right from wrong? Anything new from the architect of our misery? He's suing Tao, the police department, and the city for wrongful imprisonment. Shocking. My story hasn't changed,  and my daughter's new statement, by the way, corroborates the blood evidence  and what I've been saying all along. Lydia now realizes that she, too, saw an intruder in the house. Which you say is Benito Zapata. DNA doesn't lie, and neither did I, Lieutenant. Did you know him? Zapata. No. But since I found out who he was and what he did, I've been thinking about that. Zapata owned an auto-body shop that was fraudulently billing for repair. My wife, Elaine, was an insurance adjustor. It's possible that she found out that this creep was stealing from her company. And you have paperwork to document that theory? She kept stuff like that locked away in the safe. You're the professionals, but maybe Zapata  did  take it. I was never able to wrap my mind around why someone would kill Elaine after getting everything they wanted out of the safe. But it's beginning to make sense. Would you mind if I walk through your house one more time, just to refamiliarize myself with the crime scene? I don't want you in my house or in my life, and I especially want you to stay away from my daughter. Excuse me. You still own the house? I am an architect, captain. That house was my child. And I wanted to walk back through the front door as a free man. Anything else? No. You've been most helpful. Thank you, Mr. Reichman. I promise you, I will do everything in my power to finally make this right. Can you give me back the time I lost with my daughter? Can you give me back my reputation, my career? My friends? Because that's what I need to make this right. Sir... I am truly sorry. Just find the man who murdered my wife, and let's get this over with. Do you have any idea where he is? Fritz : According to Interpol, not in Europe, South America, or Mexico. The Bureau's had a UFAP warrant on Mr. Zapata since late in '04. A u-who? Sanchez : A UFAP... unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, Buzz. Got to love a good FBI acronym. With a proper fake passport, Zapata could be almost anywhere in the world. If he's still alive, the Bureau thinks he might... Look something... Like this. Unless he's had plastic surgery. 
 
 Good to have you back, Sykes. Little ray of sunshine returns. Zapata walked away from his wife, his job, his entire life. We didn't even realize he was embezzling until almost a year after he disappeared. Does he have children? Not that we're aware of. How much did he embezzle? $1.8 mill... One million, 800 thousand. So Zapata hit the sweet spot in terms of priority cases. Yeah, he took enough to be wanted but not enough to be  too  wanted. Back in '04, we were all focused on terrorism, to the exclusion of almost everything else. Are you sure Zapata left the country? Well, we have records of him flying to Costa Rica one month before the murder. Plus, he speaks fluent Spanish, so... But where'd he put the money? We never found it. If he's been taking it out in increments of like $90,000 a year, that's virtually untraceable. Sykes : Me... I'd be interested in hearing what Zapata's wife had to say. Bureau's been keeping tabs on her phone calls and e-mails for the last eight years. She's still in Colorado Springs. Flynn : Well, we ought to fly her out here. She might remember something useful. We don't have the budget for that. Captain, I'll pay for it myself, out of my own pocket. Or I'll fly to her. I'll use my vacation days. I have to try to find this Zapata guy. It's the least I can do. No, Mike, I was thinking that, since the federal government has an interest, maybe the FBI could fly... We don't want her to find out we've been keeping her under surveillance. It's been almost nine years. I think it's possible to say that the "watchful waiting" part of your operation hasn't worked out. Okay. Let me go check with my fearless leaders. You must be Rusty. I'm Daniel Dunn. It's good to finally meet you. Sharon : I'm sorry. He's usually much more talkative. Maybe he's overwhelmed, like me. Look, you've raised kids. How do I get him to warm up? Try something positive about his mother. He won't admit it, but he really misses her. Yeah [Sighs] I knew her intimately, not well. [ Door opens ] Think of something. Hey, that was a pretty great dinner, huh? Uh, yeah. Yeah, thanks. So, uh, tomorrow's a school day for me, so I should probably... I-I'm going, I'm going. But I-I feel like I talked so much tonight about myself that I really didn't get a chance to hear much about  you. And, also... You didn't ask me about your mother. I thought that you might find it interesting to know what she was like when we were your age. Oh. Well, uh... Sure. Well, she was, um... She was a really, really sweet girl. She was beautiful. And she had eyes exactly like yours. We met junior year. She was a new kid in school. She was really shy at first, but she had this laugh. People called it infectious. I bet she still has it. Not so much. Well... She wasn't at school very long. You know, her family moved around a lot. Yeah, I never met my mom's family. I think... I think her parents threw her out when she got... you know... Pregnant with you? Yeah. That sucks. Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't know that. Daniel, you went to high school with Rusty's mom. Do you have a yearbook that might have a picture of her? Oh, my God. I do. I do. Oh, my God. I should have brought that. You know, Rusty, I could come back tomorrow, if... I mean, if you don't mind having another dinner. Um... Yeah, uh... How about hamburgers? Rusty knows the best places to get hamburgers all over L.A. I love hamburgers. Yeah, y-you know, I might have a lot of homework tomorrow. I'm not sure yet. Listen, you've... you've been nice and all that, but how do I know that you're not trying to create some kind of... False impression? False impression? You're the one wearing a suit and tie. Is this how you always dress for dinner? I think I'm beginning to see some genetic markers appearing. Look, Rusty, there's no pressure. I'll call you. If you don't want me to come back tomorrow, we'll make our visit for some other time. How's that? Perfect. Good night, Daniel. Thank you for buying us dinner. Yeah. Yeah, thanks. No, no, no, thank  you. It was fantastic spending time with you, Rusty. It's... it was fantastic. So, we'll talk tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. [ Door closes ] Well? Why should I trust anything that he says? You can't. But the DNA confirms he is your father. He has legal rights. We can't stall him forever. Rusty, you need to get to know this man. I know it's hard to trust him. Trust  me. I'm on your side. Well, you sure as hell aren't on Mike Tao's side. I'm on the side of the victim and of figuring out how to properly conclude this case so that we avoid a civil action. By pursuing every little lead on this disappearing clown, Zapata, you make it seem like Mike screwed this case up from the beginning. Lieutenant, the court decreed that Lieutenant Tao put the wrong man in prison, and Lieutenant Tao offered to pay for Mr. Zapata's wife to be flown in himself. Look, just because he asked [laughing] Doesn't mean you have to say yes. You know, sometimes it's good to say no. Captain, all I'm asking is that you back Tao a little more. It's not that hard. I need more information. For instance, Lieutenant, maybe you could figure out why an embezzler like Zapata left blood by the sink of Mr. Reichman's house. Well, I could think of a thousand reasons for that. I don't need a thousand reasons. I need  one. Mrs. Zapata, do you know why your husband was at Mr. Reichman's house 3rd of April, 2004? How should I know? Did he have a reason to come to Los Angeles? Probably chasing a woman. What woman? Any woman he could con into hopping into bed with him. There were a lot. Benny never told me anything. Even when he was home, he wasn't home. Know what I mean? I do. Yes. Tao : You didn't know he was committing insurance fraud, embezzling? No. He never gave me anything, never told me squat. So why the FBI keeps on watching me, I don't know. Ma'am, do you have any idea where your husband has been the last 8 1/2 years? My guess? While I'm working for minimum wage as a cashier at a drug store, Benny's lying somewhere on a beach in Central America next to someone in a bikini. You want to find my husband, look for a woman who disappeared around the same time he did. I think we know someone who fits that description. Elaine Reichman. And how long ago would Elaine Reichman have had an account at our bank? At least eight years. Mr. Valdez, did you get the scan of the Interpol warrant for Mr. Benito Zapata? Because we think it might be related to the Elaine Reichman account. Sí, sí, sí, I have it, Special Agent Howard. Can you see me? I have it here. Yes, yes. Are you at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.? No, I'm in the Major Crimes division of the Los Angeles police department. Allow me to introduce Lieutenant Tao, here. And now I'm gonna turn you around, sir, and show the rest of the division and where they work. This is Mr. Valdez from Banco Nacional. It looks like an insurance office. We agree. I guess things are always more exciting in the movies, huh? Um, can I have the name again and the social security number? Elaine Reichman. R-e-i-c-h-m-a-n. I'm entering the social now. Yes. Uh... Ms. Reichman opened the account  in March of 2004. Flynn : In the amount of?! $1.8 million U.S. It's worth quite a bit more now. Lucky for her, she stayed away from the stock market. Thank you. Thank you very much. De nada. Fritz : Thank you, Mr. Valdez. Bye-bye. We'll get back to you. I just got off the phone with the state department. Mrs. Reichman renewed her passport one week before she was murdered. She didn't catch Zapata committing fraud in her capacity as an insurance adjuster. She was helping him. The couple that feels together steals together. They were planning to run off to sunny Costa Rica. And Mr. Reichman found that out somehow. Well, what have I been saying all along? It's always the husband. It's always the husband. It's always the husband. It's always the husband. And that's why Zapata's blood was at the scene. Reichman didn't just kill his wife. He also killed her lover. Zapata isn't a suspect. He's another victim. I know we can't go after Reichman again for killing his wife, but, hypothetically, what if he killed two people on the night of April 3, 2004? Two people? His wife, her boyfriend. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think he stabbed Zapata to death, too? Why didn't we know this before? Because we had a dead body right in front of us and his daughter was an eye-witness to the murder. Okay. We didn't think to look for a second victim. I understand that. But, hypothetically, how did Reichman manage to pull off two murders and dispose of one body in just 20 minutes? Architects are good planners. Maybe his original design was to get rid of both bodies. The one thing he didn't plan on was his daughter waking up. And how do you propose to find this second victim? Lydia. Where's dad? I thought he was gonna meet us here. Tying up some loose ends with his lawyer. Would you mind walking us through without him? [ Keys jingling ] [ Sighs ] Everything's exactly like it was. Where have you been living these past eight years? With my mom's parents. They hated my father. But when I turned 16, dad sent me the most... Beautiful letter. And so I went behind my grandparents' back and started driving to prison to visit him. When I got to know what a good person he really is... I started remembering more and more about what happened that night. [ Sighs ] I just... [ Voice breaking ] I can't believe what I did to him. It's just horrible. But now we know the blood evidence we found proves your father was telling the truth about another man being in the house. And thank you for admitting that. Lydia, I want to find this man in the worst way. I know it's painful, but I need you to walk us through every single thing you can remember from the moment you woke up that night. [ Breathes deeply ] I was in bed. [ Sniffles ] [  Muffled shouting  ] I heard angry voices. Aah! Mom screamed. [ Door hinges creak Someone ran out of the house. How do you know? Because I heard the door. What door? The back door, downstairs. It's always been squeaky. I got up, and I looked out the window. I saw him. The intruder... Zapata. You saw him out back? Yes. Yes, he was carrying something... a sack or a duffel bag, maybe. My dad must have gone after him. Are you sure? I clearly remember seeing dad look around the yard. I wanted to see if mom was okay, so I got my flashlight out from under my bed... And... I came down the stairs. And that's when I saw dad pulling the knife out of mom. He was trying to save her. I know that now. Sharon : Mr. Reichman? Mr. Reichman? Mr. Corbett, Mr. Reichman, this is Special Agent Howard from the FBI. You people aren't gonna question my client again without me being present. Great news, gentlemen. We finally found the money that Mr. Zapata embezzled. It's in a bank in Costa Rica, and we are guardedly optimistic that it will lead us to your wife's killer. That would be a miracle. Obviously, if we manage to catch her murderers, your settlement from any potential civil suits would skyrocket. I'm listening. There's one little hitch. The, uh... the money isn't in Mr. Zapata's name. It's in your wife's name, Mr. Reichman. Why would it be in Elaine's name? Is it possible Elaine was romantically involved with Mr. Zapata? Don't answer that. Are you insane? There's one thing I bump on. You heard your mother scream, you heard the door open... [ door hinges creak ] Oh. There's that creak. You looked out the window, and you clearly saw Mr. Zapata, and then your dad? From that very window. But how could you when all the lights were off? Your dad told the first responders that the intruder cut off the power. I know that because I flipped the main breakers on myself. I'm not making this up. I could see. Lydia, you needed a flashlight to come down the stairs? God, you're doing it again. You're... you're trying to confuse me. No. I believe you. I have always believed you. You were telling the truth from the very beginning. No. There was an intruder. He stopped at the sink to wash the blood off his hands. The DNA proves that. Or else your father killed him here. What are you saying? I think your dad came home from the airport and he snuck in the house, expecting to surprise your mother and Mr. Zapata in bed. In bed? But Mr. Zapata was right here. Fritz : Thanks to The Patriot Act, servers hang on to everything, forever. The FBI was able to access your wife's e-mail from 8 1/2 years ago. It appears she was very involved with Mr. Zapata, both criminally and romantically. So your dad killed him. Then he went to go kill your mother in the bedroom. But he made two mistakes. One, you woke up. And worse, your mother was wounded, but she wasn't dead. She was trying to crawl away. And you came downstairs and found him finishing what he started. He had no choice but to stage a break-in, cut off the power, and hoped everyone would treat you like a mixed-up little kid. That's always the problem. You plan the perfect murder, then people don't play their parts. I don't believe you. It's yourself you don't believe. Fritz : These are records of you running a password-capture program on your wife's laptop, Mr. Reichman. Sharon : If your client found his wife's correspondence with Mr. Zapata, that would be motive for killing her. Corbett : This is ridiculous. He cannot be tried for her murder again, even if you could prove it. It's not just  her  murder we're interested in. [ Police radio chatter ] [ Beeping ] Mr. Zapata, I presume. Tweezers. Please. What's this in the sternum? It's a knife tip found at your house, Mr. Reichman, and it fits perfectly on the blade of the murder weapon. You can't try him again for killing his wife. That's double jeopardy. Try double homicide, counselor. Mr. Reichman, you remember Mr. Zapata, don't you? We found his body, sir. And while you're right... we can't charge you again for the murder of your wife... we  can  use her as evidence. Lieutenant. Will Reichman, you're under arrest... again ... for extremely premeditated homicide... Or, as we like to call it around here, murder in the first degree. Your dad has agreed to take a deal. He'll be spending the rest of his life in prison. Give him credit for this... he didn't want to put you through another trial, force you to testify against him. But why don't I hate him? After... What he did to my mom... When spouses cheat, people go crazy. Maybe taking this deal and sparing you from taking the stand again was his way of saying he's sorry. For everything. Thank you for looking out for me. Would you like to say goodbye to your dad before he goes to prison? Daddy, why did you do it? Why? I'll tell you what I'm really sorry about, Lydia. I'm sorry I didn't kill you, too. Get him out of here. Oh, my God. [ Crying ] Oh, my God. My God. My God. [ Crying ] Will you at least try talking to your father this time? Please, please, call him Daniel. He had nothing to do with raising me, and I don't think we're gonna hit it off. I feel like I'm being tested. Look, I completely agree with you. Not all fathers are created equal. But Daniel doesn't seem to be reaching out because he needs you, but because he wants to. That's got to count for something. [ Doorbell rings ] Hey. Do you want to come with us? It's better I don't. Hello, Daniel. Good to see you again. You, too, Sharon. Hey, bud. Hey. What? No suit tonight? Uh... The suit was her idea. I see. You hungry? Sure. Let's go. We won't be gone long. Oh, take your time. But tomorrow's a school day, so try and have him back by 11:00.
