 Mr. Jopari, I've reason to believe you're in possession of an item that confers protection   
 - on anyone who holds it. 
 - A subtle knife. 
 - You have this knife, do you? 
 - No. 
 But I want to find the person who does. 
 You swear to put Lyra under the protection of that knife, I'll take you wherever you need to go. 
 I'll gladly do that. 
 You must make a journey which starts at Hornbeam. 
 Find the entrance. 
 Your work here is finished. 
 Save the girl and the boy. 
 The council have approved your proposal and we shall launch the airships. 
 The witches must be cleansed. 
 Lyra is indistinct because she followed Asriel through the anomaly. 
 Will you join us? 
 The Magisterium will pay for what they did to us. 
 A telegram from the North informing me that of our Magisterium soldiers at base camp have been killed in cold blood. 
 We're losing control of the North. 
 Till next time. 
 The alethiometer, someone took it. 
 But we need it. 
 Without that, we'll never find my dad. 
 I know! 
 I have something that's vital of hers. 
 She'll return. 
 Then she's mine. 
 Thank you. 
 - Will! 
 - Lyra. 
 Stay away from that boy. 
 Do you understand me? 
 He will do you nothing but harm. 
 [ROARS] 
 [GROANS] 
 Lyra, I've got it, come on! 
 [SCREECHES] 
 Lyra! 
 The skies in this world are just as beautiful as ours. 
 It gives me some hope. 
 Lyra must be close. 
 [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
 [WHOOSHING] 
 Angels. 
 It can't be. 
 They haven't made themselves visible for thousands of years. 
 And the last time they were seen, it was to make war. 
 Now that Asriel has thrown the worlds apart, they are going to him. 
 If Asriel has angels on his side, he can do anything. 
 This is the sign I needed. 
 - You want to follow? 
 - I will bring Asriel back, and we will return to our world and destroy the Magisterium together. 
 [WHOOSHING] 
 We must find Lyra. 
 GIACOMO: The fate of many worlds may rest on you. 
 - You have a task ahead of you. 
 - LYRA: Will? 
 Will? 
 His hand is worse. 
 I'm not sure we can help him, Lyra. 
 [WARBLES] 
 [WARBLES] 
 [WHISPERING] 
 : This way. 
 Lyra. 
 [SCREECHES] 
 Lyra! 
 [MUFFLED VOICES] 
 I see you. 
 [BANGING] 
 [GLASS SMASHES] 
 Will, wake up! 
 Will, we need to get out of here! 
 Angelica's downstairs and she's going to kill us. 
 [BANGING AND SHOUTING] 
 Will, hurry up! 
 [SHOUTING CONTINUES] 
 [ALARM BLARES] 
 Come on, this way. 
 Will, help me! 
 [SHOUTING] 
 Can you get us out of here? 
 Hurry! 
 [BANGING CONTINUES] 
 - He has the knife! 
 - Look, we don't want to hurt you. 
 We want to hurt you. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 You killed our brother and you stole the knife. 
 It would have protected us and our adults in the hills. 
 [SCREECHING] 
 I am so sorry about your brother. 
 Leave. 
 Now. 
 Let me see the wound. 
 Was it your knife that made that? 
 Show them, Will. 
 If you trust me, you trust her. 
 WILL: You never met her. 
 And if you think you can keep anything from her, you can't. 
 They're here to help us. 
 You ever seen such a blade before? 
 No. 
 This edge. 
 What does this edge cut? 
 - Everything. 
 - Nothing. 
 Well, you're not poisoned. 
 But this isn't a normal wound. 
 It's going to take more than plants to heal it. 
 It needs a spell. 
 We need to gather lichens. 
 Well, if that isn't the craziest thing. 
 Do you think you can fly through it? 
 Just make yourself comfortable, Mr. Jopari. 
 We're going in. 
 Woohoo! 
 Okay, so, not quite the Cave and a keyboard, but let's see if you work as well. 
 [SHE WHISTLES UNDER HER BREATH] 
 "Turning to the summit for provision of nourishment "brings good fortune. 
 "Spying about with sharp eyes like "a tiger with insatiable craving. 
 "Keeping still as the mountain, it is a bypath. 
 "It means little stones, doors and openings. 
 "Signs are coming that will steel you on your path." Good. 
 Something I can understand for a change. 
 You know, you keep staring at me. 
 I've always wanted to meet a witch. 
 My father gave me a book about witches. 
 It had pictures in it. 
 They all had raven hair. 
 I find those books irritating. 
 Asriel knows what a witch looks like. 
 Don't touch that flower. 
 I want to know everything. 
 What can you do? 
 What can I do? 
 I know you can fly, obviously. 
 And you can kill, pretty easily. 
 And the cold doesn't affect you. 
 And you can hear whispers on the wind. 
 Are we safe? 
 Is Will safe? 
 - His wound is deep. 
 - But he'll get better. 
 Right? 
 Now that we're with you, he'll be better? 
 We will do what we can here. 
 But then we must travel to our lands. 
 Our lands? 
 The flora is more powerful in our world. 
 Taking us home? 
 I pledged to keep you safe, Lyra. 
 We'll do so at home. 
 A place I know. 
 A place I can hide you. 
 ANGELICA: Why isn't she frightened? 
 She's not from here, is she? 
 [WHOOSHING] 
 LYRA: Maybe they're right. 
 Maybe we should go to my world. 
 Why did you leave, Lyra? 
 To investigate Dust. 
 To try to do my best by Roger. 
 The thing is, these witches... 
 they're connected to the Earth, they can find answer after answer. 
 And my father? 
 What does the alethiometer say to do? 
 Will, I can see the way you're hiding your hand, I know it's bleeding. 
 Only a little. 
 There are more powerful plants in my world. 
 - They say that, and I think that, too. 
 - Look, I get it. 
 You're scared 'cos you think I can't go on. 
 I can do this. 
 We can do this. 
 Ask the alethiometer where my father is, what world he's in, where we might find him. 
 [CLICKING] 
 [WHIRRING] 
 [WHIRRING] 
 He's close. 
 What?! 
 He's in this world. 
 [SCREECHING] 
 [SCREECHING] 
 So this is a new world? 
 New to those not born in it, as old as yours or mine otherwise. 
 What Asriel has done has shaken everything up, Mr. Scoresby. 
 Looks empty. 
 Not so. 
 Beyond that headland is a city once powerful and wealthy. 
 That's where we're headed to. 
 The knife bearer may be there. 
 Once great, the city has fallen on hard times. 
 In another life, I'd be looking for what I could scavenge. 
 In another life, neither of us would be here at all. 
 You have a strange way about you, Mr. Jopari. 
 They say things about shamans. 
 - Oh, yeah, what do they say? 
 - That they have powers. 
 That they can fly. 
 Yet you cannot. 
 Oh, but I can. 
 - How do you figure? 
 - I needed to fly. 
 I summoned you. 
 Here I am... flying. 
 I'm human, but I've learnt a few things along the way. 
 I've spent time with witches, academicians, spirits. 
 I've found folly everywhere. 
 And this journey, is it folly or wisdom? 
 This journey? 
 I don't know. 
 So we find the bearer of the Subtle Knife, and what then? 
 We tell him what his task is. 
 And that task includes protecting Lyra? 
 It will protect us all. 
 - That's it, we're stopping. 
 - No, ask the alethiometer. 
 Ask how close my father is. 
 There's no point getting you to your father if, when we get you there, you're half-dead. 
 No, you're using me as an excuse to stop. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know you wouldn't use me as an excuse to stop. 
 Apology accepted. 
 You should rest, too. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 I have never been more sure. 
 You want the knife, don't you? 
 [CHILDREN WHISPER] 
 GIRL: She's there. 
 It's all right, you know? 
 You can come out. 
 Hello. 
 I'm Mary. 
 Do you want something to eat? 
 It's no good for you at all. 
 It's full of sugar. 
 I won't tell your parents. 
 Haven't got parents. 
 The Spectres got 'em. 
 The Spectres? 
 How come they're not getting you, miss? 
 Can you not even see them? 
 Oh, we can't see them either, but... 
 Paola. 
 Hi. 
 So, you're alone, then? 
 The other adults used to look after us, but then they got scared, ran up to the hills. 
 To the mountain. 
 Now the other kids have gone, too. 
 You're not from this world, are you? 
 Like that Lyra girl. 
 Lyra? 
 You've seen Lyra? 
 I don't like her. 
 She did something bad to Tullio. 
 We were trying to kill her, but she escaped. 
 Was that wrong? 
 Yes. 
 Everything's wrong here, miss, you'll learn that soon enough. 
 Where has Lyra gone? 
 She's with the witch. 
 Miss, can I have a hug? 
 Yeah. 
 Can you stay for a bit? 
 Look after us? 
 The Spectres aren't getting you, you don't have to go like the others. 
 You can make us have baths and tell us what to do and all that. 
 I've been sent here to do something important. 
 We'll be fine. 
 We've got each other. 
 Go on, Paola. 
 [RETREATING FOOTSTEPS] 
 Wait. 
 You shouldn't be here alone. 
 Come with me. 
 I'll bring you to your adults. 
 JOPARI: I'm thinking about my wife and my son. 
 I feel closer to him here. 
 I haven't been back to this world since I left my own. 
 I hadn't even met Sayan Kotor. 
 You don't see your daemon in my world. 
 I'd given up hope of finding a window and getting back to them. 
 Anyway, you were right. 
 I should sleep. 
 If only I could. 
 I tell you what, why don't we make some coffee instead? 
 Thank you. 
 [IGNITION CLICKS] 
 Let me help. 
 Yeah, can you magic us up some fire? 
 One moment. 
 [MATCHES RATTLE] 
 Right. 
 The knife that Will carries, the way it's cut him, it's no ordinary cut. 
 It scares me, how he got a weapon this powerful. 
 You think you need to protect me from Will? 
 Will's knife is amazing. 
 It can be very dangerous if it's in the wrong hands, but... 
 Will's the bearer, he wouldn't do anything to me. 
 Serafina Pekkala, my job is to help Will find his father. 
 Will's father? 
 The alethiometer said so. 
 I stopped trusting it after Roger died. 
 But I lost it. 
 And I found out how important it is. 
 How it's a part of me. 
 So if it says I need to help Will, then that's what I've got to do. 
 People told me it was your reading of the alethiometer that I'd find impressive. 
 The truth is... 
 it's your obstinacy that's your gift. 
 Our task is to protect you, Lyra. 
 If that means protecting you and Will, then so be it, even though this world makes me very uneasy. 
 Well, you should be uneasy. 
 There's creatures here. 
 They don't hurt children, but they could hurt you. 
 We will help you find Will's father... 
 but we need to stop Will's bleeding first. 
 [WHISPERED SPELLS] 
 [WHISPERS CONTINUE] 
 Please tell me he'll be all right. 
 We've done all we can here. 
 Your alethiometer, where does it say to find his father? 
 [CLICKING] 
 [IT DINGS] 
 Up. 
 Keep going up. 
 That's all it says. 
 Stay close to him. 
 He'll be cold tonight. 
 We'll continue up the mountain in the morning. 
 PAN: We feel safe here... 
 Don't we? 
 Ahem. 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] 
 Fra Pavel. 
 I have consulted the alethiometer as you've asked. 
 I don't entirely understand what I've seen. 
 Perhaps if you tell me, we shall understand it better together. 
 May I speak freely? 
 Even though I should rightly be punished for such words. 
 Whatever it is... 
 it has come from the alethiometer, am I right? 
 You are. 
 So why should you be punished for telling me something which you in turn have been told? 
 Go ahead. 
 Mrs. Coulter is looking for her child. 
 The girl has gone into another world. 
 Before Asriel opened the hole in the sky, Mrs. Coulter came to see me. 
 There was something she wanted me to ask. 
 What was the question? 
 Who is Lyra Belacqua? 
 And? 
 I've discovered the girl has another name. 
 The witches know it from a prophecy. 
 It's heresy, beyond doubt. 
 You are not a heretic. 
 Repeat what you have learned and waste me no more time. 
 I rather fear you have become Cardinal     
 - at the most burdensome of times. 
 - Tell me what you know. 
 The name is her destiny. 
 It foretells she will be in the position of the one who brought about our downfall. 
 Mother of us all. 
 Cause of all sin. 
 What is the child's name? 
 The alethiometer does not forecast. 
 If it comes about that she is tempted by the serpent, then it is likely she will fall, and Dust and sin will triumph. 
 The name, Fra Pavel. 
 Speak the name. 
 You know this place. 
 You really have no sense of where Lyra might be? 
 I know it a little. 
 Why are you so nervous? 
 Well, it's just... 
 
 
 
 the Spectres have multiplied since Asriel tore the sky. 
 One minute this place is empty, the next it isn't. 
 And then it's too late. 
 They didn't get you. 
 You managed to get back. 
 - Only because I ran. 
 - Oh, yes, you were frightened. 
 I need to find her and, in turn, you will get the boy with the Subtle Knife. 
 [SHE EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 It's almost like Spectres sever their victims. 
 They don't sever, these Spectres. 
 It's stronger than that, whatever they do. 
 We could learn from this. 
 I have been praying. 
 And I believe that we have yet to understand our true purpose. 
 But today, the Authority himself has spoken to me. 
 This Magisterium... 
 The Magisterium over which I am Cardinal, has a new direction. 
 Fra Pavel... 
 has brought me information of a threat so grave in nature... 
 that the world has only seen it once before. 
 Under my leadership... 
 we will do whatever is necessary. 
 We have sent troops through the anomaly... 
 to face that threat. 
 Yes, Cardinal. 
 In the name of the Authority... 
 we will not waver. 
 And the first to partake of this great sacrifice... 
 will be the child... 
 Lyra Belacqua. 
 WILL: It's holding up, the spell worked. 
 A wound caused by magic must be closed by magic. 
 I've done my best. 
 She's lost a lot, for one so young. 
 I know that. 
 KAISA: Tell him. 
 [HE CHIRPS] 
 She's important, Will. 
 There's a prophecy surrounding Lyra, a prophecy that includes a boy who must travel with her. 
 I don't know whether you're that boy. 
 She thinks you're her responsibility. 
 Don't lose sight of the fact that she's your responsibility, too. 
 She must be protected. 
 [SLOW FOOTSTEPS] 
 [SHE GASPS] 
 [EERIE RUMBLING] 
 [RUMBLING GROWS LOUDER] 
 [WHISPERS]: Marisa. 
 [MONKEY GRUNTS SOFTLY] 
 [RUMBLING AND BURBLING] 
 [HE SHRIEKS] 
 [LOCK CLICKS] 
 [SHE BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 [HE SHRIEKS] 
 [RUMBLING] 
 [RUMBLING INTENSIFIES] 
 [DISTORTED ROARING] 
 [DISTORTED ROARING] 
 Those are the Spectres? 
 There's a swarm of them down there! 
 Yes, that's them. 
 If they're that close to the tower, then the knife isn't there. 
 We should land. 
 Lyra could be down there in danger. 
 The Spectres would seize us immediately. 
 They can't get us up here. 
 What if Lyra's there? 
 Don't worry, the Spectres feed on Dust. 
 Children are not attractive to them. 
 As soon as adulthood comes, they'll be there. 
 We will help everyone and Lyra by finding the bearer. 
 If we die, we're of no help and we can do no further good. 
 Take us further up. 
 Over the forest. 
 The knife bearer is not in the city. 
 [DEEP HORN BLOWS] 
 What's that noise? 
 What do you see? 
 [ENGINES THRUM] 
 Magisterium airships. 
 I didn't think they'd be allowed to cross the worlds. 
 Keep us flying. 
 The wind will be on our side. 
 [LOW ROARING] 
 Go... 
 [SHRIEKING] 
 You can control them. 
 [WHISPERS]: Isn't it wonderful? 
 Let's celebrate. 
 Do you think Angelica and Paola will be all right? 
 I don't think they were as bad as we thought. 
 Although I was scared. 
 I've never seen children act like that before. 
 I have. 
 My mum. 
 Every now and again, she'd... 
 start thinking things that weren't true. 
 Doing stuff that didn't make sense. 
 Like... 
 touching the railings in the park or... 
 counting the bricks in the wall. 
 Stuff like that. 
 These boys found out. 
 They were mean. 
 For no reason. 
 They were worse than Angelica. 
 When I was younger... 
 I used to pretend that my dad was some place abroad... 
 and that one day, I'd go get him. 
 He'd have the answer to everything. 
 And I could go to school. 
 Have friends. 
 But the older I got... 
 The more you stopped believing that. 
 Yeah. 
 I couldn't trust anyone. 
 Till you met me. 
 Yeah. 
 Another? 
 Hmm. 
 Tell me something. 
 [SHE GIGGLES] 
 I will tell you anything you like. 
 How do you control them? 
 Well, they consume what makes us human, so I just... 
 hid that from them. 
 - I suppressed myself. 
 - [MONKEY GRUNTS] 
 Marisa, with that ability, we can go wherever we please in this city. 
 Yes, I can find Lyra, and you can finally find the boy, and the knife is yours. 
 Ours. 
 You understand? 
 It has a power that could be useful for both of us. 
 And I would like an equal to share it all with. 
 You think me your equal? 
 In every way. 
 [WHISPERING] 
 : Then let's drink to that. 
 [THEY GIGGLE] 
 [THEY CHUCKLE] 
 The Subtle Knife of Cittàgazze, not even the makers know what it can do. 
 No-one is invulnerable to it. 
 Matter. 
 Air. 
 Go on. 
 [HE SIGHS] 
 This place... 
 The window. 
 All the things you've kept from me. 
 It would have been so much easier if you'd told me about Lyra when you first had her. 
 You did so much for me. 
 Don't think I don't know that. 
 But your ambitions were small. 
 They would have always ended here. 
 Boreal, I don't need you. 
 You would only hold me back. 
 [HE GROANS] 
 You are not, nor have you ever been, my equal. 
 [HE CHOKES] 
 What have you... done? 
 Don't fight it. 
 Don't fight it. 
 [SOFT HISSING] 
 [HISSING STOPS] 
 Goodbye, old friend. 
 [ENGINES RUMBLE] 
 Mr. 
 Jopari, you remember that problem I mentioned? 
 It's grown more urgent. 
 Yes. 
 Yes? 
 That's all you're saying? 
 Yes? 
 They're faster than us. 
 They were always going to catch up at some point. 
 Well, now is not a good point. 
 We've no defences,     which means that we've got to set down. 
 The only way is into that valley. 
 Do the best you can. 
 Open your eyes and wake up! 
 We're not playing around. 
 Do you need wind? 
 No, they can use wind as easy as us, and they're built for speed. 
 [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
 Do you need a storm? 
 Is that all you can summon, weather? 
 You're a shaman. 
 Shaman us up some big guns and some iron cladding. 
 [HE CHUCKLES] 
 [THUNDER CRACKS] 
 Are you summoning a storm? 
 Because I can't pilot well in a storm! 
 I trust your skill. 
 Can we trust him? 
 Do we have another choice? 
 I guess these are the cards we've been dealt. 
 It's time to play 'em. 
 For Lyra? 
 For Lyra. 
 [THUNDER CRACKS] 
 [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
 [EERIE GROANING] 
 [LOW ROARING] 
 [ECHOING GROANS] 
 [SCREAMING] 
 - Will, the knife! 
 - Lyra! 
 [SPECTRES SCREECH] 
 [THEY ROAR] 
 Mm. 
 [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
 [HE WHIMPERS] 
 Strength is salvation. 
 [SIZZLING] 
 [SHE GASPS] 
 Hmm. 
 Remember that. 
 Whoo! 
 You cook up a fine storm, Mr. Jopari. 
 HESTER: There's still two more! 
 - Get down! 
 - [BULLETS THUD] 
 [MUFFLED SPEECH AND GUNFIRE] 
 [WIND WHISTLES] 
 [BIRD CHIRPS] 
 [MASS SQUAWKING] 
 [SQUAWKING CONTINUES] 
 It's turning! 
 The gas canister! 
 Hold on!
