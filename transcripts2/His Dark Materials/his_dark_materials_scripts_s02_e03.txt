 There's an Oxford in your world, too? 
 Has it got scholars? 
 Maybe I can find one who can tell me about Dust. 
 People are going to be looking for me. 
 Bad people, the police. 
 You mustn't draw attention to us. 
 Charles. 
 Lizzie. 
 If you ever want to know more about these artefacts... 
 Well, they came to the lab. 
 She's followed Asriel, she's followed him through that window. 
 You're a scholar? 
 Believe it or not, I am, yeah. 
 I need you to tell me about the particles you study. 
 There's a knife in a tower, surrounded by angels. 
 The legends are true. 
 This knife, the boy will lead us to it. 
 Your parents exchanged letters. 
 For some reason, the police think that they're important. 
 You were right, he came to us. 
 I have concerned myself with a man named Stanislaus Grumman. 
 People say he knows the whereabouts  of some kind of object that gives magical protection. 
 I thought I might find this item for her and get her that protection. 
 If I don't find out about Dust, Roger's death will be for nothing. 
 We study something called dark matter. 
 That's Dust. 
 I found the scholar! 
 She's called Mary Malone and she's got an engine that can see Dust,  and she's going to make it talk. 
 It says you have something important to do. 
 The Magisterium in my world want to destroy Dust. 
 They think Dust is evil. 
 I think what they do is evil. 
 Did it really say my dad was alive? 
 You can trust me. 
 I'm leaving. 
 Are you going to find Asriel? 
 I'm in search of something infinitely more valuable. 
 SERAFINA: Witches of Lake Enara, hear me. 
 We are facing devastation on a scale not seen in centuries. 
 The Magisterium will pay for their crimes,  but we cannot lose sight of the great war ahead. 
 The prophecy states that life in all of the worlds depends on the child. 
 She is more important now than ever. 
 We must find Lyra before anyone else does. 
 PAN: We're not really doing this, are we? 
 I promised Mary I would,  and I think that machine has more to tell us. 
 But the alethiometer was clear. 
 We need to help Will find his father. 
 First, we need to find out more about Dust. 
 For Roger. 
 If it's such a good idea... 
 Sh! 
 WHISPERS: ..then why are we creeping? 
 We need to stay with Will. 
 It's too dangerous for Will in Oxford. 
 The police are looking for him. 
 But the alethiometer said that we should... 
 Lyra, are we sure about this? 
 It's fine, there's no-one around. 
 Lee Scoresby... 
 ..I call ye and declare ye now. 
 Return! 
 Return. 
 Return. 
 Return. 
 Return. 
 Return. 
 Return. 
 Return. 
 Return. 
 Return... 
 WIND WHISTLES  Lee, we're moving. 
 The wind is a-whistling! 
 Lee, wake up! 
 That's weird. 
 We weren't heading for Yenisei. 
 Looks like the kind of place a famous explorer might wind up. 
 You said that about the last three towns. 
 We're on our way, Mr Grumman. 
 FLAMES ROAR  REPORTER: John Parry, what will you be taking with you from home? 
 JOHN: If I could, I'd take everything from home. 
 But I can't do that, so a toy car of my son's. 
 ELAINE: This world is broken. 
 It takes extraordinary people to fix it. 
 JOHN: Sorry, Will. 
 ELAINE: Like your dad. 
 Like you. 
 JOHN: Truly epic letters. 
 ELAINE: Like you... 
 Take up his mantle. 
 JOHN: My darling Elaine. 
 We've finally arrived. 
 We're stuck 140 miles south of the island... 
 Dearest Elaine. 
 I'm lying awake here, thinking of you. 
 It's nearly summer solstice... 
 ..22nd of August. 
 Such agony to leave you behind. 
 Do send more news of our boy. 
 Lyra! 
 Are you awake? 
 We need to talk to the alethiometer again. 
 My dad's alive. 
 We can find him. 
 Lyra? 
 What did you tell Lyra? 
 Let's see if we can make this work. 
 Oh, come on, you did better than that for Lyra. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 I'm DI Walters. 
 I'm interested in a visitor you had yesterday. 
 PAN: How much longer am I going to be in this bag? 
 Mary! 
 SOFTLY: You have to go. 
 Why are we whispering? 
 There's a policeman in my office asking questions about you. 
 He knows you came to see me yesterday. 
 How does he know? 
 I have no idea. 
 Lyra, are you in trouble? 
 Do you need help? 
 Sorry to keep you waiting, I was just... 
 Can you both step into the office, please? 
 What a wonderful moustache. 
 We heard there was a child  running unsupervised around St Peter's College. 
 What's your name? 
 Lizzie. 
 What's yours? 
 I'm Inspector Walters, Lizzie,  and I've got a few questions, if that's OK with you. 
 Of course. 
 Where are you from? 
 I'm from London. 
 But you're staying in Oxford. 
 I am. 
 With whom? 
 With some people. 
 Friends. 
 What's their address? 
 I don't know exactly,  but I can find it out for you, if you want. 
 Is this really necessary? 
 Shouldn't we wait for the girl's parents? 
 Do you go to school? 
 Yes, sometimes. 
 But you're not at school today. 
 Well, it's the holidays. 
 I really don't think this is appropriate. 
 And you've come to see Dr Malone today because...? 
 I'm interested in her work. 
 Lizzie is welcome here any time. 
 Do you understand her work? 
 Some of it. 
 Is Will staying with you? 
 Yes, he is. 
 He's... 
 Where is he... 
 ..Lyra? 
 Sorry, could I speak to you over here, please? 
 I really think that the girl's guardian... 
 No! 
 No! 
 MARY GASPS  Stop her! 
 PORTER: No running! 
 Help me, Pan! 
 PAN: Take a left, Lyra, just down here. 
 DI WALTERS: Student suspect... 
 PAN: This way! 
 PAN: I can't see him. 
 Maybe we lost him. 
 Lizzie, isn't it? 
 From the museum. 
 You look lost. 
 Can I give you a lift somewhere? 
 No. 
 Are you sure? 
 Hey! 
 Actually, yes. 
 Where to? 
 Summertown. 
 SEAT BELT WARNING BEEPS  Seat belt. 
 It's on the right-hand side, pull it across you. 
 Did you find anything more about those skulls you were looking at? 
 I found it fascinating. 
 I asked about them after we spoke. 
 BUCKLE CLICKS BEEPING STOPS  Are you OK? 
 Um, yeah, it's just... 
 I... 
 I can't be late, my mum will worry. 
 I'm sure she will. 
 BELT CONTINUES TO LOCK AS SHE TUGS  I-I think I know where I am now,  you can just drop me off wherever you like. 
 I'd rather take you home, save anyone worrying about you. 
 It's fine, honestly, just let me out. 
 Just let me out! 
 Please, Mr Latrom, let me out. 
 SEAT BELT UNBUCKLES  DOOR LOCK BEEPS  Lizzie! 
 Your bag. 
 Thank you. 
 Until next time. 
 SHE PANTS NERVOUSLY  PAN CHIRPS  It's gone. 
 What? 
 WAIT! 
 He's stolen the alethiometer. 
 He was nothing but a thief! 
 You know, I've got a good feeling about this one. 
 It was getting dark about this time. 
 I still had the club in this hand,  and I was thinking about what he'd just said... 
 ..and he said it again. 
 To which, I said to him... 
 You want to guess what I said? 
 I can't imagine. 
 I said... 
 .."No."  That's it? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Well, that is some story you got there. 
 Actually, now that we're friends, maybe you could help me out. 
 You heard of a Stanislaus Grumman? 
 Mm. 
 Strange man. 
 Lean, tough, curious about everything... 
 You know where he is? 
 You know, he was a geologist or an archaeologist. 
 Some say he became a shaman  and went to live way off in the wilderness  with some folk up the Yenisei. 
 That's interesting. 
 But the last I heard, he died. 
 He died? 
 A trader told me Grumman got his leg caught in a trap -  cut it right to the bone. 
 We had a man in here last week said Grumman survived that trap. 
 Well, that's great news. 
 He tell you anything else? 
 He worked at the observatory for a while,  up the mountain,  not far from here. 
 Maybe try up there. 
 Thank you. 
 OK, if I've got this right, you should be able to make words  and I should be able to hear them. 
 It's just a simple question that needs a simple answer. 
 Is Lyra safe? 
 One word - yes or no. 
 SHE TYPES  Lyra? 
 What are you looking at? 
 Nothing. 
 What are you after? 
 You know, maybe I can help. 
 I know this place backwards. 
 Who's that in the tower? 
 No-one. 
 There's definitely someone up there. 
 It'll be a ghost or something, I don't know. 
 Wouldn't surprise me if it's haunted. 
 It's a person. 
 It can't be. 
 There's no way in and no way out. 
 What's it for, then? 
 The Torre degli Angeli? 
 It belongs to the Guild. 
 The Guild? 
 No-one knows much about them, really,  but my brother says  they're this group of men who know important stuff  like philosophy, alchemy... 
 Cowards, mind you -  they ran away when the Spectres came,  just like all the other grown-ups,  and now only the children are left here. 
 They get your parents? 
 The Spectres? 
 No. 
 You're lucky. 
 Got mine. 
 Right in front of me. 
 Ate the life out of 'em. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Makes you nervous, being on your own. 
 It does. 
 I'd best be off. 
 You need a plan. 
 You're almost a grown-up, and you know what that means. 
 Won't be long before the Spectres are after you. 
 I'm not scared. 
 That's because you've never seen them at work. 
 STEADY BEEPING  Is Lyra safe? 
 ANGRILY: Right, then. 
 Maybe I'm going mad. 
 Still no sign of the girl. 
 Sorry? 
 She got away, apparently, the kid. 
 Oh, right. 
 Well, I'll be sure to keep an eye out, of course. 
 Night, George. 
 BEEPING INTENSIFIES  SCRATCHY INTERFERENCE  HE PANTS  Hello, sir! 
 Close the door, please. 
 What brings you to the observatory, Mr Scoresby? 
 I've just got a couple of questions, if you don't mind. 
 Wow, this is something. 
 It is. 
 Even better when the fog lifts. 
 Well, I'll bet. 
 Can't do anything about that? 
 No, you can't control the weather. 
 It's a powerful force. 
 Don't I know it. 
 You work here alone? 
 Yes. 
 The others... 
 It's just me. 
 Dr Haley, could I ask you about a Dr Stanislaus Grumman? 
 An Englishman, despite the name. 
 I understand he worked here some years ago. 
 What do you want with Dr Grumman? 
 Uh... 
 You wouldn't happen to know where he is now, do you? 
 Somewhere up the Yenisei river. 
 Why do you want to know? 
 So he is alive? 
 Dr Stanislaus Grumman... 
 ..is a heretic. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Well, you've been most helpful. 
 We'd better get going - the weather being what it is. 
 "By their fruits shall ye know them. 
 "By their questions shall ye see the serpent  "gnawing at their heart."  GROWLS  Amen. 
 You have a good day. 
 Well, that was weird. 
 Yenisei river, though, that's... 
 GUNSHOTS  Ah! 
 Dr Haley... 
 Damn fool, why did you do that?! 
 Don't. 
 Let me help you. 
 Dr Grumman is an enemy of the Magisterium. 
 And so are you. 
 He didn't give us a choice. 
 You didn't shoot to kill. 
 We need to go. 
 Is there any place left that the damn Magisterium... 
 ..hasn't infiltrated?! 
 Let's get out of here. 
 AGGRESSIVE BARKING  DOORBELL RINGS  Hi! 
 Oh! 
 Oh, hi. 
 Hi. 
 You forgot, didn't you? 
 No, I would never forget my favourite niece and nephew  coming to visit. 
 I just got home, actually. 
 We haven't had our snack today. 
 Yeah, I felt faint  in the car. 
 Well, that is shocking. 
 Let me see what I have - I haven't been shopping for a few days. 
 Oh, there you are. 
 Yes! 
 Mine says "muesli" on it. 
 With chocolate! 
 It's really bad for you, I promise. 
 Why are you always reading my mail? 
 There has to be some way of finding out what's going on in your life. 
 You look knackered. 
 I'm not knackered. 
 I'm just frustrated. 
 I'm on the cusp of a massive breakthrough,  and they're going to kick us out of the lab in a few days. 
 When was the last time you did something you enjoyed? 
 Ah! 
 What's going to happen if you take some time out from work? 
 A break could lead to that breakthrough, couldn't it? 
 BIRDS CHATTER  Now, what will we do? 
 I told you we shouldn't have come back. 
 What are you doing just going off like that? 
 What happened? 
 What's wrong? 
 I've lost it. 
 Lost what? 
 The alethiometer - someone took it. 
 But we need it. 
 Without that, we'll never find my dad. 
 I know! 
 And that's not everything. 
 What? 
 When I went to see the scholar... 
 ..the police were there asking about you. 
 They must've spotted us yesterday. 
 We need to go back to Cittagazze. 
 Now! 
 No, we can't leave without the alethiometer. 
 We can't do anything without it. 
 Do you have any idea who took it, then? 
 There was this man I met at the museum. 
 He gave me a lift. 
 Wait, Lyra, the card. 
 Yes! 
 He gave me his card. 
 Charles Latrom. 
 That's his address. 
 Let's go round there, see what he says. 
 SIRENS  The police'll be looking for us both now -  we have to hide until it's dark. 
 Come on. 
 SCREECHES  GRUNTING  SNIFFS Hold back, I know that bird. 
 Serafina Pekkala sends good wishes to the bear-king. 
 I send them back. 
 But if it's help you're after, I cannot give it. 
 I see the mountains are melting. 
 The seals have depleted -  my bears will starve. 
 Asriel's hole in the sky has damaged too much. 
 I am not here on Serafina's behalf,  but for Lyra Silvertongue. 
 GRUNTS  The Magisterium are making hell for the witches,  but all Serafina cares about is finding the girl. 
 There is a prophecy that says she is to bring the end of destiny,  to return our free will,  not in this world, but far beyond. 
 Does Lyra know of this? 
 She must do it in ignorance. 
 If she's told what she must do, it will all fail. 
 GROWLS  So Lyra's a toy for your future,  set on a course she can't change. 
 It is for all our futures. 
 We are all subject to the Fates. 
 I couldn't follow her up the mountain,  but, later, I returned... 
 
 
 
 ..and saw traces in the snow. 
 She followed Asriel through. 
 Thank you. 
 The Magisterium, how do they target you? 
 They have destroyed our homes,  killed our people,  but we will find our own justice for that. 
 INDISTINCT SPEECH  Yes, ma'am. 
 DOG BARKS  Apologies for the unscheduled stop, ma'am. 
 We've secured a room for you  and we'll resume our journey as soon as conditions improve. 
 For your sake, I hope that we do. 
 Room 17, left at the top of the stairs. 
 Second outsider we've had in today. 
 Really? 
 We had an aeronaut in earlier,  and I've just heard he's been arrested. 
 METALLIC CLANGING  Who are you and what do you want? 
 Is that how you greet visitors? 
 Did you bring food? 
 No. 
 Then, who are you and what do you want? 
 You are not endearing yourself to me, Mr Scoresby. 
 Madam, I've done nothing wrong. 
 I don't know where you think I've deviated,  but I happen to think the Magisterium  is one of the finest organisations around,  and I will happily make any sort of pledge to prove it. 
 Whatever you want, name it. 
 So, can I go now? 
 Hmm. 
 What does the name Lyra Belacqua mean to you? 
 Let me think. 
 Gee, I don't know. 
 What does it mean to you? 
 SHE LAUGHS  This is serious. 
 Your life depends on it. 
 Oh, is she any relation to Asriel Belacqua? 
 Cos I've always been a fan of his. 
 Often thought one day I'd meet that man,  shake his hand and ask him how he did it all. 
 You know exactly who I am, don't you? 
 And I know who you are. 
 I don't think we've been properly introduced. 
 Lee Scoresby. 
 The famous aeronaut. 
 HE GROANS Where is Lyra? 
 Can't help you there. 
 Well, that's interesting  because the last time I saw her, she was flying off  from my station in your balloon. 
 I ain't never going to tell you where to find that little girl  because my life is worth one-tenth of hers. 
 Indeed, it is. 
 But you do misunderstand me, Mr Scoresby. 
 SHE SIGHS  I'm her mother. 
 So? 
 So she needs me. 
 No, she doesn't. 
 There are things that she just doesn't understand. 
 See, I think there are things that you don't understand. 
 The worth of a life would be one. 
 Didn't you shoot a man dead this morning? 
 Do you have children, Mr Scoresby? 
 No. 
 Then, how can you possibly understand  what it feels like? 
 I need... 
 ..to find her. 
 You love her. 
 Of course I do. 
 It's not enough, though, is it? 
 Love. 
 It doesn't mean you won't hurt her,  doesn't mean she's safe with you. 
 It doesn't work that way. 
 Just tell me where she is. 
 I can't... 
 ..because I do love her. 
 And I swore I'd keep her safe. 
 She's safe with me. 
 The woman who turns children into ghosts? 
 I don't think so. 
 SHE SNORTS  SCREECHES HE GROANS  Yeah, I've got very few skills in life... 
 ..almost nothing to offer the world, if I'm honest... 
 ..but I did find out at a young age I'm good with pain. 
 This one time, my father hit me so hard with his shoe,  my leg swelled up. 
 I couldn't sit. 
 I couldn't stand. 
 I couldn't do anything. 
 He says to me, "Don't you even think about running away."  Run away? 
 I couldn't reach down to put on my shoes. 
 FEIGNING SYMPATHY: Mm. 
 HE GROANS  Yeah. 
 He'd humiliate me until I'd said enough sorries  to make up for whatever thing he decided that day  would justify his temper. 
 You know? 
 You do know, don't you? 
 You know...because you had parents just like mine, of course you did. 
 Of course you did. 
 SHE SCOFFS  You know nothing about me. 
 Yeah, and I believed it. 
 I believed him, I believed I was nothing, believed I deserved it. 
 I was almost grateful for it when it came. 
 Ever feel that? 
 Grateful? 
 You did, didn't you? 
 I know what it's like to feel hurt like yours. 
 But, right now, I feel more alive than I have in years  because of her. 
 She's given me hope. 
 SCREECHES  I will rip out every nail  and I will break every bone... 
 And it won't break me, and you know it won't,  because it wouldn't break you either. 
 You can threaten me, torture me... 
 ..but I will never tell you where Lyra is. 
 Because my life is worth one-tenth of hers. 
 SCREECHES  It's been a long time since you've talked about him. 
 I know. 
 You did good. 
 SHE BREATHES ANXIOUSLY  WARBLES COMFORTINGLY  TRILLS SOFTLY  Paddington... 
 Paddington? 
 Paddington! 
 LIFT DINGS Psst! 
 Mr Brown, in here. 
 What are you doing? 
 We need to get into that archive. 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Paddington, please don't take this the wrong way,  but are you certain there was an explorer? 
 You didn't just find a hat and make up some...? 
 What? 
 WHISPERS: Just sit down. 
 Why are you looking at me like that? 
 This should be a safe place to hide for a while. 
 Is it me, or is it hot in here? 
 Why do I feel so...? 
 Uncomfortable? 
 Mm. 
 Flushed? 
 Mm. 
 Queasy? 
 Mm. 
 It's called a hard stare. 
 My aunt taught me to do them when people had forgotten their manners. 
 Give me strength. 
 Mr Brown, you can trust me. 
 There really was an explorer. 
 If we can find him, I know he'll give me a home. 
 A proper home. 
 What is this? 
 It's popcorn. 
 It's disgusting! 
 It tastes like wood shavings. 
 Then stop eating it! 
 I'm trying. 
 Do you take anything seriously? 
 Is that why you came looking for me? 
 You thought I was messing around? 
 Just because I'm not sat in a corner crying  doesn't mean I don't take things seriously. 
 I lost my best friend. 
 He was killed by my father. 
 And I think about him every single day and I miss him. 
 I want to talk to him. 
 I want to tell him I'm sorry because it's my fault he died. 
 AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sh! 
 I came looking for you because I was worried about you. 
 HER BREATHING ACCELERATES  SHE EXHALES DEEPLY  SCREECHES  HISSES  You stole them from the guard. 
 Thank you! 
 There's a prophecy. 
 About Lyra. 
 Witches speak of it,  and it means people will be looking for her, and not all of them good. 
 So you mustn't trust anyone. 
 I'm searching for Lyra myself, but if you find her... 
 ..please... 
 ..keep her safe. 
 I will. 
 I promise. 
 Resurrection comes in the strangest of forms. 
 Do you think you can stand? 
 I hope so. 
 How are we going to find Grumman? 
 Head up the Yenisei river, see if we can find him up there. 
 GRUNTING  Are we getting the balloon back? 
 No. 
 It's exactly what they'll expect. 
 We can't fly out of here. 
 So, what do we do? 
 If we can get ourselves a boat, we should be on the water by dawn. 
 GUARDS SHOUT  Find Grumman and his item of protection,  then find Lyra before her mother does. 
 Now. 
 DOG BARKS AND GROWLS  INSISTENT BARKING  OK... 
 SHE EXHALES  WHISPERS  ENGINE WHIRS SOFTLY  BEEPING INTENSIFIES  SCRATCHY INTERFERENCE  "To the mind that is still... 
 "..the whole universe surrenders."  SHE SIGHS  This is it. 
 Come on. 
 You ready? 
 Lizzie? 
 What a pleasant surprise. 
 You'd better come in. 
 ALARM PASSCODE BEEPS  It's nice to see you again so soon. 
 Take a seat. 
 You haven't introduced me to your friend, Lizzie. 
 This is... 
 ..Mark. 
 What can I do for you, Lizzie... 
 ..and Mark? 
 Lizzie thinks she left something of hers in your car earlier. 
 We've come to ask for it back. 
 I take it you mean this. 
 That's mine! 
 Yours? 
 I think you'll find it's mine. 
 I'm a collector. 
 You're a thief. 
 So let me call the police and they can settle this. 
 No! 
 No? 
 Not in your best interest, William. 
 Or yours, Lyra. 
 SHE GASPS  You still don't recognise me. 
 You're not as astute... 
 ..as your mother. 
 The party in London. 
 Now she remembers. 
 You don't even know what you've stolen. 
 Lyra, stop. 
 You're just going to stick it on a shelf, so give it back. 
 Can't do that. 
 Give it back! 
 Lyra! 
 Sit down before I call the police. 
 I was going to give you a chance...to earn it back. 
 Get me the object that I want... 
 ..and I'll return the alethiometer to you. 
 What is it that you want? 
 I'm aware you found a doorway... 
 ..that leads to another world. 
 A crossroads world. 
 The man that made that doorway... 
 ..has a knife. 
 I think he's hiding in the tower,  the one with the carved angels around it. 
 Torre degli Angeli. 
 Bring the knife to me... 
 ..and I'll give you what you want. 
 We'll do it. 
 Good. 
 We'll get your knife.
