 Witches hear the immortal whispers of those  who pass between the worlds. 
 They speak of a child who is destined  to bring the end of destiny. 
 But she won't walk alone. 
 Together, they will change everything. 
 I set out for the North to try and discover what had happened  to the Grumman expedition. 
 Grumman made reference to a certain natural phenomenon,  only seen in the lands of the North,  in the city in the sky. 
 Where does that light come from? 
 It isn't light, it's Dust. 
 Lyra, this is Mrs Coulter. 
 She may be of some interest to you. 
 I'm surprised Asriel doesn't talk about you more. 
 You know my uncle? 
 You can't treat me like this. 
 My uncle won't let you. 
 He's a failure of a man and a failure of a father. 
 She won't stop until she finds you. 
 She's your mother, Lyra. 
 Lee Scoresby, I can fight and I can fly,  and you're going to need all the help you can get. 
 Lyra! 
 Lyra! 
 You fought for her, and now her fate is in another's hands. 
 I'm no use to you now. 
 She needs all of us. 
 You're late. 
 I've been busy. 
 Where? 
 Oxford. 
 I need to find this man. 
 Colonel John Parry. 
 He was lost in Alaska. 
 He left a wife and a child. 
 There's probably answers in that house. 
 A paper trail. 
 You're just like him. 
 Your father. 
 And you're going to follow him, take up his mantle. 
 There's a knife in a tower surrounded by angels. 
 And this knife, the boy will lead us to it. 
 Argh! 
 Little Lyra! 
 Hello, Thorold. 
 I did not send for you. 
 Asriel. 
 Roger Parslow,  I am very pleased you came. 
 If I can see that city up there in the sky,  then we can build a bridge and we can cross. 
 Cross to multiple worlds? 
 Come here! 
 Help me create a new republic of heaven. 
 Our child is in this world. 
 Goodbye, Asriel. 
 We didn't mean this to happen. 
 But it did. 
 We need to find Dust. 
 Find Dust before he does. 
 We will make sure your death is not in vain. 
 Goodbye, Roger. 
 Lyra? 
 Lord Asriel has torn up our sky. 
 And left the world in chaos. 
 The witches believe this is the start of a powerful prophecy. 
 One that could destroy all existence... 
 ...or make it anew. 
 It is time to prepare... 
 ...to draw sides. 
 I know, I miss Roger, too, but we can't go back. 
 Lyra, look! 
 Asriel's photogram. 
 The city in the sky. 
 I don't like this. 
 Someone left in a hurry. 
 Where is everyone? 
 Something's happened here, Pan. 
 Asriel? 
 I wouldn't put it past him. 
 Should we ask the alethiometer where everyone is? 
 No. 
 We're not asking that thing anything. 
 Not yet. 
 I think we can trust it. 
 It's never lied to us. 
 Without it, would Roger have died? 
 No. 
 We need to make our own way now. 
 We have all observatories trained upon the schism. 
 All are reporting back the same thing. 
 One world. 
 And do they have a sense of how to block up this hole? 
 Not as yet. 
 A new world and Asriel simply exploded it into being. 
 Presumably, it was already there. 
 Heresy! 
 Cardinal... 
 ..it is hardly heresy any more. 
 It is visible in the sky above our heads. 
 If you would just leave the vessel to look at it. 
 I'll not be lectured by you on this issue. 
 Nor should you have to be. 
 Cardinal Sturrock, I simply ask... 
 ..that, rather than focus on what is in the past,  we focus on what is in the present. 
 The fuse has been lit,  the bomb has been exploded. 
 The world is aware. 
 We cannot ignore what everyone has seen. 
 We would lose... 
 Damn you! 
 Perhaps I may help? 
 There is a witch on board, caught as part of our round up of undesirables  following this incursion. 
 For centuries, witches have claimed knowledge of other worlds. 
 This witch may help us understand this instability. 
 Good. 
 Do me the honour of talking with her. 
 That is, if you men have... 
 ..finished your discussions. 
 We have yet to understand, what is your precise role in all of this? 
 My "precise role"? 
 What did you and Asriel discuss on the mountain on that night? 
 I never reached Asriel, Your Eminence. 
 Why do I doubt that? 
 I have absolutely no idea. 
 But you're right. 
 Asriel needs stopping. 
 This explosion requires investigation, not ignorance. 
 There is one, possibly multiple worlds out there. 
 And these witches have always known more than they should. 
 Let me find out what. 
 We cannot allow this woman to take control! 
 You know, I look around this room... 
 ..and I see failure. 
 Father MacPhail, who failed to even emerge from Asriel's laboratory. 
 Fra Pavel, who couldn't read his alethiometer  to see what was happening. 
 I am not immune from failure myself. 
 I didn't reach Asriel in time  and I vow now never...to fail again. 
 This witch, you believe you can find an answer to what Asriel did? 
 Well, I believe that I am more... 
 ...persuasive than most. 
 Test me on what I discover. 
 And if I discover nothing... 
 ..then, do your worst. 
 It's a cafe. 
 Maybe we could find something to eat in there. 
 You're hurting me! 
 Ow! 
 That'll teach you for sneaking around. 
 I'm sorry I scared you. 
 You didn't scare me. 
 SorryIscared YOU. 
 Please let me go. 
 Who are you? 
 Lyra Silvertongue. 
 Is this your house? 
 No. 
 I'm Will Parry. 
 Finally, someone else to talk to. 
 That's Pan. 
 Where's your demon? 
 How's it talking? 
 He does know not to touch me, right? 
 That's a talking animal. 
 No, it's not a talking animal. 
 That's my demon. 
 Your what? 
 You don't have a demon? 
 I can't see one. 
 That's impossible. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 No. 
 Come on, Pan. 
 Lyra Silvertongue... 
 ..wait! 
 Don't make assumptions. 
 He seems kind. 
 He could be helpful. 
 Fixed my heater yet? 
 Heater's still busted. 
 Compass, too. 
 Compass has got fritzed by the storm. 
 Lee, you're being strange. 
 I'm not being strange. 
 The whole world is talking about that tear in the sky. 
 The witches will want us to join the fight. 
 We're not here to talk about the fight, we're here to talk about Lyra  and see if the witches can help us. 
 They might know this weapon we're looking for. 
 Lee, look. 
 Well, isn't that something? 
 Lyra, we need to think sensibly. 
 If your father was here, he's gone. 
 So, we need a new plan. 
 But we're going to need friends and... 
 We had a friend, he died. 
 Please, think. 
 Perhaps he's our only chance to... 
 Hi. 
 Hi, Will. 
 Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. 
 It's just... 
 I've never seen a demon before. 
 To me, "demon" means something evil. 
 Er...thanks? 
 You're not from here, are you? 
 From this world? 
 Me neither. 
 How did you get here? 
 I crossed through a window... 
 ..that my father made. 
 You? 
 Er... 
 I, er, followed a cat through a hole in the air. 
 It sounds mad! 
 So, there are three worlds and two windows? 
 All connected to here. 
 Look, I know this world doesn't make sense. 
 And I don't know whether I'm odd for not having a demon  or you're odd for having one. 
 But, maybe, we could look around together? 
 The three of us. 
 That's the best idea I've heard all day. 
 Strange new times. 
 It must be hard to be separated from your sister witches? 
 Now I am trying to help you. 
 Not out of any...generosity of spirit but, rather, pragmatism. 
 Such an underrated quality. 
 You know that you're trapped? 
 You and your demon. 
 All you have is the information you carry. 
 Share that information  and we can become productive. 
 And productive people... 
 Well, they are generally treated... 
 ..very well. 
 I'm looking for a child last seen with an aeronaut  and one of your kind at Bolvangar. 
 I can tell you nothing. 
 Hm. 
 A witch's cloud-pine. 
 Is it true that within it is your ability to fly? 
 Your ability to use magic? 
 What is within me is vaster than anything you can imagine. 
 Someone must be able to tell us how these worlds are connected. 
 There's millions of worlds. 
 My father saw this one - why? 
 I think it has to do with Dust. 
 I think that's why I'm here. 
 Dust? 
 You don't have Dust? 
 No, we have dust. 
 I'm just guessing my dust is not the same as your dust. 
 Well, some people think it's sin. 
 "Sin"? 
 I actually think it's more complicated than that. 
 I think, if bad people think it's bad,  then, maybe it's good. 
 Did you hear that? 
 There's someone there. 
 Wait! 
 I just want to talk to you! 
 Stop! 
 Come on! 
 Hey! 
 Get off! 
 Get off! 
 Leave me alone! 
 Who are you and why were you running from us? 
 Who are you and why were you chasing us? 
 Because... 
 ..you're the only other people we've seen here. 
 We just want to know about this place. 
 Nah, I'm good. 
 Don't worry, we're good at snuffling the safe stuff, aren't we, Paola? 
 The bread's still fresh. 
 Where are the grown-ups? 
 The clever ones have run. 
 Since the attack. 
 Spectres are everywhere. 
 What are Spectres? 
 Is that why no-one's here? 
 You don't know what Spectres are? 
 They're bad, these Spectres? 
 You're safe yet. 
 You're still a girl. 
 He's close, though, to the change. 
 What change? 
 When you're a man  and the Spectres can get you. 
 Just like Tullio. 
 Who's Tullio? 
 No-one. 
 We've got to be careful, that's all. 
 So, if Spectres are everywhere, then why can't we see them? 
 Only adults can see Spectres. 
 What do they do? 
 It's awful. 
 They take your insides out. 
 You're still alive,  but everything that makes you human... 
 ..that's gone. 
 Our parents, it happened to them. 
 So, it's just us now. 
 And we're happy. 
 Aren't we, Paola? 
 Can run around the city now. 
 Do what we like. 
 And so can you. 
 See you around. 
 What are you doing? 
 Paying for the food we ate. 
 Paying who? 
 Eating without paying for it is stealing. 
 If you start behaving like a grown-up,  the Spectres will get you. 
 What do you think of her? 
 I don't trust her. 
 Nor do I. 
 They didn't have demons either. 
 Yeah, looks like you're the odd one out. 
 You're going to have to keep him hidden. 
 I'm not hiding! 
 Sisters, the child we have expected has vanished. 
 I have invited Mr Scoresby here to share his thoughts. 
 Speak, Lee. 
 Since losing Lyra,  I have concerned myself with a man named Stanislaus Grumman. 
 Has anyone heard of him? 
 No? 
 Well, various rumours surround him  but people say he knows the whereabouts of some kind of object  that gives magical protection. 
 Knowing Lyra, and the trouble she's in,  I thought I might find this item for her and take it to her. 
 Get her that protection. 
 Thank you, Lee. 
 This protection will be of use to her wherever she is. 
 You think so? 
 Take this with you. 
 And whenever you need my help,  hold it in your hand and call to me. 
 I shall hear you wherever you are. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 Lord Asriel has opened the way from this world to another  and the child of the prophecy is on her path. 
 Lee can help her. 
 We must decide our part to play. 
 Queen Skadi? 
 Queen Serafina Pekkala, that man does not belong here. 
 He is here at my reckoning, as are you. 
 Ruta Skadi is angry. 
 Everyone should be angry. 
 Sisters! 
 Katja Sirkka has been taken prisoner by the Magisterium. 
 I have word they are rounding up anyone  who questions their authority. 
 The way those animals in the Magisterium have cracked down  upon the world since the opening. 
 Towns tightly controlled by armies. 
 We're out of our depth here. 
 Shut up, Hester. 
 So, the time has come to act,  to show the Magisterium that their actions have consequences. 
 And I am here to beg you, Serafina Pekkala,  and all the sisters here. 
 Join me in rescuing Katya. 
 I believe we have no choice. 
 The prophecy was clear, we must find the child. 
 The prophecy is not all there is. 
 You risk too much. 
 The Magisterium has thrived under your indifference. 
 Ruta Skadi will show them we are indifferent no more,  with or without your clan's help. 
 Lyra! 
 Are you hungry? 
 I made an omelette. 
 If you have omelettes in your world. 
 So, you're a kitchen boy, then? 
 What? 
 In your world, you're a kitchen boy. 
 No. 
 What's in this? 
 Egg. 
 
 
 
 I'm guessing you don't use cutlery in your world either. 
 Very funny. 
 It's good, the "ommalat". 
 Does Pan need to eat, too? 
 Some cheese or...? 
 No. 
 He's a demon. 
 But thank you for the offer. 
 I've never had to explain a demon before. 
 It's a part of me. 
 He's me and I'm him, I guess? 
 You'll soon understand. 
 How long have you been here? 
 Couple of days. 
 You? 
 Three days. 
 I was thinking.... 
 ..maybe we are better off  sticking together from now on. 
 You want me to stay? 
 To set up camp here? 
 I meant, we should explore together. 
 I didn't mean you should move in. 
 Probably easier, though, isn't it? 
 Now that we're sticking together. 
 Every house here is deserted, you don't have to move into mine. 
 YOUR house? 
 First, you attack me, and then you run away. 
 And now you're trying to stay here. 
 You move at 100 miles an hour! 
 "Hundred miles an hour"? 
 It means fast. 
 Oh, I do move quickly, I always have. 
 But you said we're better off together,  and so I guess you're stuck with me. 
 I'll take the small bed if you want. 
 I was sleeping there. 
 OK, OK, fine. 
 Yeah, I'll find somewhere downstairs. 
 Hm. 
 Finally, you make a good decision. 
 A very good decision. 
 I will ask once again. 
 Are you witches travelling between worlds? 
 What did you tell Asriel of what he'd find? 
 Please, no more. 
 Come on, Katja. 
 I know he had a witch lover. 
 He boasted of it to me. 
 Asriel is not even your concern. 
 That's more like it. 
 Who is my concern? 
 The prophecy has begun and you cannot stop it,  however powerful you think you are. 
 What is this prophecy that I cannot stop? 
 The prophecy is about a girl named Lyra. 
 What do you know about Lyra? 
 She is known by another name. 
 But I will not betray the child of the prophecy. 
 Tell me... 
 ..who Lyra Belacqua is! 
 Yambe-Akka! 
 Come to me! 
 She is ready! 
 She has called for death. 
 Be at peace. 
 Stop her! 
 Get in here now! 
 The witch is escaping! 
 What is going on? 
 There's no point in just sitting there looking at it. 
 At some point, we need to start using it again. 
 We tried it your way and haven't gotten answers. 
 Be honest, what do you want to know? 
 I'd ask if my mother's still following me. 
 Or where my father was. 
 Or what this place is. 
 Whether Roger would forgive me. 
 Or what should I do now. 
 So ask it. 
 Lyra, you can read it for a reason. 
 No. 
 We've come here to find out about Dust and we need help. 
 I've got the shower fixed. 
 Shower? 
 Washing? 
 You wash? 
 Yeah, at a sink. 
 Or in a bath. 
 Showers are like baths, but standing up. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, at least, consider it. 
 And if you change your mind, you've got towel and soap. 
 I'll take the first shower. 
 I don't need a stand-up bath. 
 Do I? 
 That's one question you don't have to ask the alethiometer. 
 No, I'm fine as I am. 
 Whoa, watch out! 
 See? 
 It's easy. 
 Thanks. 
 Don't thank me. 
 You're the one who taught me how to do it. 
 You seem to have added your own twist to it. 
 What do you think's in there? 
 Over here, look. 
 Go on. 
 It must have been the Spectres. 
 Lucky they can't attack us. 
 Until we're old enough. 
 She said I was close. 
 Those screams aren't human! 
 Stop! 
 What would you hurt this cat for? 
 You aren't from here. 
 You aren't from Cittagazze. 
 Get out of my way. 
 Maybe I don't want to get out of your way. 
 Then I'll make you get out the way. 
 Angelica, was it? 
 Go home, Angelica. 
 Come on. 
 Good job at staying hidden! 
 You needed my help. 
 He's no better? 
 No. 
 We need to dock as soon as we can. 
 I shall find the finest physicians to attend to him. 
 Or you couldn't. 
 What are you proposing? 
 If he lives, it's clear the Authority wants him to lead. 
 If he dies, then a choice has been made. 
 The Magisterium needs strong leadership,  not a bloated man who never knew how to turn down a glass of wine. 
 Mrs Coulter, why should I trust you after what happened? 
 I explained what happened. 
 I made sure you were safe and I continued up the mountain. 
 But this is not about trust. 
 This is about faith. 
 You heard the man, he'd seal up the world. 
 He'd try to persuade people that this never happened. 
 And you and I both know the Magisterium cannot survive that. 
 It needs you. 
 And in return for this counsel,  or this support? 
 I give this counsel because I believe in the right path. 
 And, yes, with you in place, I can pursue other interests... 
 What interests? 
 That is not your concern. 
 I will tell everyone on the ship that the Cardinal  has specifically requested to be left alone in prayer  and I will personally tend to his wounds. 
 Murder? 
 I will make it my sin. 
 As a first act... 
 ..of service. 
 You know it's strange that everyone's gone,  but the anbarics still work. 
 The what? 
 The anbaric, those lights. 
 Oh! 
 We call them electric. 
 Electrum's a stone. 
 I mean, it's a jewel which grows in the gum of trees,  and it gets insects stuck in it sometimes. 
 Oh, you mean amber. 
 So, your world's like my world, but with the words mixed up. 
 Or your world's like my world, with all the words mixed up. 
 The experimental theologians in Oxford would love this place. 
 Did you just say Oxford?! 
 In my world there's a place called Oxford. 
 That's where I come from. 
 I'm from Oxford. 
 That's where my window is. 
 Two Oxfords? 
 Worlds apart. 
 There's an Oxford in your world, too? 
 Has it got scholars? 
 I mean, there's a university, but... 
 Maybe I can find one who can tell me about Dust? 
 Lyra, you're...you're from Oxford! 
 Will, we need to go now! 
 Please! 
 Show me the window. 
 No-one will talk about Dust in my world, but maybe in yours,  they can give me answers. 
 Answers to what? 
 I wouldn't ask you, if it wasn't important. 
 I need your help. 
 I'm not safe in my Oxford. 
 And I'm not safe in my Oxford. 
 I mean, it's risky for me to return,  but there are things to check on back home. 
 Fine. 
 First thing tomorrow morning. 
 Thank you. 
 You know,  you do have a demon... 
 ..even if you don't know it. 
 Can you see it? 
 Not yet. 
 But I will. 
 It didn't lie to us, Lyra. 
 It helped us find Billy Costa. 
 It told us the truth when we asked it. 
 Exactly. 
 It told us about Billy. 
 It didn't tell us what my father planned to do with Roger. 
 So, it tells us the truth but... 
 It just doesn't tell us everything. 
 He trusts me. 
 I need to know whether I can trust him. 
 So, ask it about Will. 
 He's a murderer. 
 He's a murderer?! 
 The good kind. 
 Just like Iorek. 
 But there's something else about him, too. 
 He's connected to this place. 
 He's got something to do here. 
 I think we both do.
