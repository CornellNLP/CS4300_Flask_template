 LEAR: Grey infected Elizabeth with the virus.   
 You have a passport for a spectacular future.   
 She never loved you. She never will.

 [BOTH SCREAMING]   
 - Stop the lights! 
- Amy's linked to him.   
 Elizabeth, too.   
 I heard a man talking in the room next door.    
 I think his name is Anthony.   
 CARTER: I'm here for Amy.   
 It's Amy that's the savior.    
 Maybe we can prevent Elizabeth's turn.    
 - Crowd out Fanning's virus? 
- Precisely.    
 - Damn it. 
 - WOLGAST: I watched our daughter die,   
 - then I met this little girl. 
- AMY: Mommy!    
 - No! 
 - WOLGAST: She doesn't have anybody.   
 DOYLE: You guys served together.   
 Special ops, right?    
 Taught me everything I know.    
 This whole thing's gone to hell.   
 Come up with a plan to get the three of you out.

 Where's Mom?    
 We have an emergency. She got pulled into a surgery.    
 - She's gonna be home late. 
- But what about the team dinner?    
 Mom was supposed to bring all the trophies.    
 Oh, my God. Dad, look at their faces.    
 They all think that they're getting trophies.    
 Hey, what am I? An amateur? I got a plan.    
 Come on, let's go.    
 [CHUCKLES]: Come on.    
 That was awesome.    
 [ENGINE WHIRRING]    
 [THUDDING]    
 - You okay? 
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.    
 How's your head?    
 I'll live.    
 - We have to get back to Amy. 
- Okay.    
 Is there anything sharp over there?    
 Looking.    
 What the hell's going on over there?   
 A security breach and six fatalities.   
 Is this gonna keep happening?   
 SYKES: Yes. Mr. Secretary,    
 I was one of the first to champion this project and its potential, but I was wrong.    
 This entire facility needs to be buried in concrete.    
 Or we could take a fresh look at our challenges and adjust.    
 The girl has exhibited signs of telepathy.    
 She's impervious to disease, and so far, she's healthy.    
 She's everything we've hoped for and more.    
 What will it take to make the place sustainable?   
 First, we're gonna reduce the feeding schedule of our patients by   %.    
 This will keep them subdued and compliant.    
 I have    new security personnel incoming, and we're gonna increase their rotations so that nobody's    
 on  B long enough to come under viral influence.    
 There is no safe level of exposure.    
 Everyone is mentally vulnerable to them.    
 - SECRETARY: Okay, so... 
- Well, hold on, now.    
 Here's a bug that could work in our favor, Mr. Secretary.    
 The virals, they're all connected.    
 They have a sort of a hive mind, and they're all linked to Fanning.    
 You kill him, they all die.    
 Including the girl?   
 Yes. She is linked to him, just like the rest.    
 God forgive us.    
 Deputy Guilder, you're gonna stay at Project Noah.   
 Put your new security measures into place.   
 I'll leave it up to you whether Doctors Sykes   
 and Lear should be reassigned.   
 [DOOR OPENS]    
 [DOOR CLOSES]    
 The Secretary of Defense has given Guilder full authority.    
 Where does that leave us?    
 Well, I'm pretty sure I'm getting fired.    
 I can't speak for you.    
 Wolgast, Lila, they never made it back from the hunting party.    
 - What does that mean? 
- Nothing good.    
 - I'm worried about them. 
- Since when?    
 Since Winston. Since Guilder.    
 Since this place turned into the Overlook Hotel.     
 So what are you gonna do?     
 [SIGHS]     
 I'm gonna find them.     
 From there, it gets complicated.     
 The pain was horrible.     
 It was like something was digging throughout my entire body, just trying to get out.     
 I tried to kill Fanning.     
 Oh, Jonas.     
 All the patients infected with his blood felt what you felt.     
 So I guess he's probably pretty angry.     
 Safe to assume.     
 What else is new?     
 How are you feeling now?     
 Mm, s-still have chills and a headache.     
 You know, like that... that time at Thanksgiving I had the flu.     
 Your whole family was there, and I had to cancel dinner.     
 - [LEAR CHUCKLES] 
- Only this is... this is definitely worse.     
 My mother still thinks you were faking.     
 Of course.     
 Look up for me.     
 [GASPS]     
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.     
 Are you okay?     
 I guess that's not a good thing.     
 The virus is beginning to mutate in your body.     
 So, what now?     
 We fight it.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 We'll use this as a shim, okay?     
 You're gonna jam it into that slot right there.     
 Come on.     
 Here you go.     
 Okay.     
 So, how have you been?     
 Anything new?     
 Oh, no, not much.     
 Just trying to avoid being executed     
 by the United States government.     
 Also, vampires are real, so that's cool.     
 WOLGAST: Got it. Got it, got it.     
 Okay, good.     
 Let me get you.     
 Okay.     
 LILA: Hey, hey, hey.   
 Hey. Hi.     
 - Here's the stuff. 
- All right.     
 - Thank you. 
- Uh-huh.     
 And I heard you kicked butt today, kiddo.     
 Mm. I'm sorry I can't make it.     
 Babe, what's with the streamers?     
 You're decorating the restaurant.     
 You never said anything about that.     
 And, Eva, whatever your expectations are, lower them.     
 You don't understand. Bri's mom did it last year.     
 It was bad.     
 People called it hot garbage.     
 It has to be awesome.     
 Okay. Well, we're gonna streamer-shame Bri's mom to death.     
 - We got    minutes. Let's go. 
- [LILA LAUGHS]     
 I'm gonna try to make the end, okay?     
 All right. I love you.     
 What about me?     
 Oh, I love you.     
 - Go, Strykers! 
- Go, Strykers!     
 [BEEPING]     
 [LOCK CLICKS, DOOR OPENS]     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 Hello.     
 I need your help.     
 I'm looking for Agent Wolgast.     
 Aren't you the head of security?     
 I'm asking as his friend.     
 You shot at him at least twice.     
 I'm trying to be his friend now.     
 Have you seen him?     
 Like you did with Winston?     
 No.     
 I tried, but it doesn't really work that way.     
 It just happens sometimes.     
 Hmm.     
 Is he in trouble?     
 He's okay.     
 Agent Wolgast can take care of himself.     
 You've seen that guy in action.     
 He beat you up.     
 True enough.     
 I'm gonna find him, okay?     
 I promise.     
 Oh. These are for you.     
 Sit tight. I'll be back.     
 [BEEPING, LOCK CLICKS]     
 CARTER: Did he just give you chips?     
 Carter. Where have you been?     
 I'm around.     
 You changed.     
 That is true.     
 And so will you.     
 When?     
 Soon.     
 We need to talk about it.     
 You know where the agent is?     
 No.     
 And if you're gonna get through this,     
 you need to rely on yourself.     
 You're scaring me.     
 There is some scary stuff coming.     
 [EXHALES]     
 Hey.     
 You want me to show you where your book is?     
 GUILDER: You know, I came up under Dick Cheney.     
 Say what you want about the man, he did what had to be done.     
 He believed in promoting based on merit, not rank or status.     
 Sir?     
 Washington has approved your security proposal.     
 We're moving forward. Great work. Thank you.     
 Oh. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that.     
 Between you and me, Martinez, my ass is on the line here.     
 This whole staff, top to bottom, is suffering from battle fatigue.     
 I don't blame them. Three years is way too long.     
 There are a lot of brilliant minds out there, sir.     
 We can bring in a new medical chief, staff, security.     
 Richards seems competent to me.     
 Maybe. But either way, it feels like the right time to institute the new security protocols.     
 All right, well, let's talk about access.     
 Well, I would advise dialing back across the board.     
 - Well, I'll remain the last word, but... 
- Absolutely.     
 But whoever else you give access to the codes needs to be trustworthy.     
 I have a couple of suggestions.     
 All right. Shoot.     
 ♪  That's what they say...  ♪     
 Daddy, the guy wants the deposit.     
 Okay, sweetheart. I was just gonna park the car, but here.     
 Tell him to use the blue card, okay?     
 - Isn't there another box? 
- No,     
 we brought everything inside.     
 But where are the markers?     
 - What markers? 
- For the group photo.     
 Everybody signs everybody's, like a yearbook.     
 I don't know anything about markers, but if we're keeping score, I think that one is on Mommy.     
 It-it's okay.     
 Don't say it like that.     
 - Hold on. 
- EVA: What?     
 All right, kiddo. Daddy's gonna try to save the day.     
 - I'm gonna find some markers. 
- We have    minutes.     
 - [CLICKING] 
- Okay.     
 Is that enough? Can you get your hand out?     
 - Here we go. 
- [THUDDING]     
 [BOTH SIGH]     
 Oh, God. We must be close.     
 They're gonna pull us out one at a time.     
 One guy's gonna take me first.     
 It's gonna go fast, faster than you think.     
 And then it'll be over.     
 Brad, what if something goes wrong?     
 Something always goes wrong, but we have to make it through anyway.     
 For Amy.     
 You remember that time we got food poisoning from that  bacalhau  cart in Rio?     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Oh, my God, yeah.     
 This isn't as bad as that.     
 It's a miracle either of us survived that.     
 Maybe we've been dead this whole time.     
 I mean, let's be honest, none of this seems tethered in reality.     
 We're doing everything we can.     
 I have some ideas.     
 I'll be right back.     
 Oh. Oh, shoot.     
 Hey.     
 Hey. So Amy's blood didn't make a dent in Fanning's virus.     
 Yeah, I think I know why.     
 Let's bring up the, uh, routine monitoring protocol.     
 How's Elizabeth?     
 She's, uh... she's brave as hell.     
 She's cracking jokes and trying to take care of me.     
 I've seen what's coming for her and, uh...     
 [SIGHS] Can we just bring up the data?     
 Oh, yeah. Of course.     
 Guilder's revoked my security clearance.     
 Let me try.     
 Okay, so here are the viral titers.     
 Yeah, okay, see here, this surge?     
 I think that's dormant reservoirs activating to replace the virus you just destroyed.     
 Yeah, dormant reservoirs, like in HIV?     
 Yeah, which means we need to knock out all of Fanning's virus in one punch.     
 Well, if we can't overwhelm them, they'll just be kicking her viral transformation     
 - into high gear. 
- Yeah, I'm desperate.     
 I did this to her. I need to fix it.     
 I'm not gonna let her turn into one of them.     
 Fanning, I'm getting a little worried about you.     
 And by "you," I mean all of us because we're waiting on you.     
 It's almost over.     
 Really? 'Cause it kind of seems like we're losing the upper hand here.     
 I'm not leaving without Elizabeth.     
 What if she doesn't choose you?     
 Is this how it's gonna be?     
 I mean, I thought you said we'd feel free.     
 Then why do I feel so alone? Why do I care about Richards?     
 Tell me this is just a humanity hangover.     
 I wish I could, kiddo.     
 Are we ever getting out of here?     
 Elizabeth makes   .     
 Not if she says no.     
 She'll say yes.     
 Then we'll be   .     
 But what if she doesn't?     
 CARTER: You know, you can't actually take that back with you, 'cause we're not really here.     
 But it's there when you want to come get it.     
 You're thinking about your mom.     
 She gave me that book.     
 When you think about her, tell me what you remember.     
 I don't want to talk about that.     
 I know you don't, but it's important.     
 Come on, what is it?     
 I can see a piece of it.     
 I can see you and the book.     
 You're in front of a school.     
 - You're crying. 
- Just because you're in my head doesn't mean it makes it your business.     
 It's totally my business. We're linked.     
 All of us who got the injection.     
 I'm not joining your stupid club.     
 Focus on the memory, Amy.     
 I see you running.     
 You're still crying.     
 You're lost, trying to find home, but it-it's hard.     
 It hasn't been home for long, has it?     
 Wait, where are you running?     
 Where is home, Amy?     
 You're being a jerk. Now, take me back to my room.     
 Now, you can leave any time you want to.     
 What happened to your mom?     
 What did you do? Say it.     
 - You're being mean. 
- You th-think I'm mean?     
 The guy that's coming for you is pure evil, Amy.     
 This is just a dry run.     
 Now tell me what happened.     
 You feel bad about something. Say it.     
 What is it?     
 [CRYING]: It was my fault, okay?     
 I'm the reason she's dead.     
 She made us move again, and I hated everything about the new place.     
 I wanted to go to school.     
 They didn't let me in because she forgot to register me.     
 So I went home, and we had a bad fight.     
 I told her I hated her, and she cried.     
 She thought I meant it.     
 I didn't want to see her cry.     
 So I took my book, and I left.     
 And when I came back...     
 ...the ambulance was there.     
 It was too late.     
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR]     
 GUILDER: Amy, mind if I come in?     
 Hello, Amy.     
 I wanted to drop by, pay you a visit, see how you're feeling.     
 Where's the agent?     
 Mm, I wanted to talk to you about that.     
 Agent Wolgast has gone home.     
 He wanted me to tell you goodbye.     
 I don't believe you.     
 I'm sorry.     
 Adults can be unreliable, as I'm sure we both know.     
 You have no idea what goes on around here, do you?     
 You think you're in charge, but you're not.     
 Why do you say that?     
 Are you seeing something?     
 Screw you and your weird mustache.     
 - CASHIER: $ .  , please. 
- WOLGAST: Nine-seven... [LAUGHS]     
 Wow. Oh, man.     
 - You got the $ .   or what? 
- Yeah, I do.     
 I just, uh, left my wallet across the street, but, uh... [LAUGHS]     
 Look at that. Help is on the way.     
 CASHIER: That's wonderful news.     
 [THUDDING]     
 This is it. Put your cuffs back on.     
 - Okay, I'm ready. 
- Okay.     
 [DISTANT BIRDCALLS]     
 [GRUNTING]     
 [TWO GUNSHOTS]     
 WOLGAST: Hey.     
 Put all the money in a bag.     
 - WOLGAST: Hey. 
- Now!     
 Do what he says. It's okay.     
 - Hurry up, dumbass! 
- Hey, hey, hey.     
 You'll be out of here with your money in a few seconds. Take it easy.     
 - You look like a cop. 
- I'm not. I promise.     
 I'm just trying to help, man     
 [DOOR OPENS, BELLS CHIME]     
 - Dad, there... 
- No!     
 [SIGHS]     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO]     
 LILA: Someday maybe you'll tell me how we got here.     
 The car has GPS, so if we take it, they'll track us.     
 The pumping station's not too far away.     
 We can hitch a ride back to Noah on one of the cleaning crew's Humvees.     
 Except they know your face, Brad.     
 Okay, clarification:     
 We're stealing one of the cleaning crew's Humvees.     
 - Great. 
- What do you want me to say, Lila?     
 That I'm sorry for keeping you safe?     
 Which way to the pumping station?     
 LILA:  Sometimes, I feel like...   
 ...I can't breathe.     
 Like, if I let myself, I'll just fade away.     
 Going back to work is the answer?     
 It's something to try.     
 It's got to be better than walking around that empty house.     
 I miss her so much.     
 And, Brad, do you think getting back to work is a good idea?     
 I think it's a delusion.     
 THERAPIST: Say more about that.     
 I think that no amount of therapy or going back to work is going to change what happened to Eva.     
 LILA: Of course it's not gonna change what happened.     
 I just want to let something else happen.     
 You barely even talk to me.     
 I don't understand how you can even think about going back to work.     
 I want to be useful.     
 I want to be needed.     
 I want to help.     
 That's what makes me feel better.     
 I want to help you.     
 I want us to help each other, but... that doesn't seem to be happening.     
 How's it make you feel when she says that?     
 Why don't you want to respond to that?     
 Look, I have a really busy day.     
 If you don't mind, I'd like to cut it a little early.     
 I'm staying.     
 If you don't want the time, I'll use it.     
 [RICHARDS SIGHS]     
 You've been missed at the Bureau.     
 And also at my goodbye party.     
 Yeah, I'm sorry I missed it.     
 I shouldn't be giving you this.     
 [WOLGAST SIGHS]     
 RICHARDS: You really couldn't identify him in the lineup?     
 Yeah, no, it's-it's weird.     
 Don't do it.     
 I have no idea what you're talking about.     
 Do you want to get something to eat?     
 Just hang out?     
 Might be good for you.     
 No, I'm good. I ate already.     
 What's his address?     
 I have no idea.     
 You already memorized it.     
 Come on, Brad. What is it?     
      West Race Avenue.     
 Apartment  A.     
 She was my daughter, Clark.     
 She was my goddaughter.     
 [INHALES DEEPLY]     
 They will nail this guy to the wall.     
 He will rot in a cell.     
 But if you kill him... you're gonna be locked up.     
 And I'll be one best friend short.     
 Go home.     
 Hold your wife.     
 Start over.     
 It is possible.     
 [EXHALES SHARPLY]     
 [THUNDER ROLLING]     
 Loman, do you copy?     
 Loman, do you read?     
 - [COMM CRACKLES] 
- Brad, do you read me?     
 Brother.     
 Are you okay?   
 Is Lila okay?   
 Do you need help?   
 I'm worried you might have picked up a tail.     
 [COMM CRACKLES]     
 - Should we be worried about him? 
- No, we should not.     
 Are you okay?     
 As long as we get back to Amy.     
 - You okay? 
- [SCOFFS]     
 
 
 
 Not in the slightest.     
 Um...     
 I'm sorry about before.     
 You were a bully.     
 I want to talk about that story you told me.     
 Do you like seeing me cry?     
 - This is why you're doing this? 
- No.     
 I want you to beat Fanning.     
 I don't even know who Fanning is.     
 He knows you.     
 And he wants to take all that guilt and pain that you feel... and use it against you.     
 You had a fight with your mom. That's all.     
 I made her sad.     
 It's not your fault.     
 She had an addiction. That's all.     
 She wouldn't want you to be sorry.     
 I bet...     
 I bet she's sorry.     
 She wouldn't blame you for what happened.     
 No one does.     
 Because it wasn't your fault.     
 Okay?     
 How can I trust you?     
 What Fanning wants is for you to believe the worst about yourself.     
 He'll make you feel alone... and scared.     
 He'll make it seem like he's the only one who wants you.     
 It's not true.     
 Don't buy it.     
 You have people. You have the agent.     
 You have me.     
 And you have yourself.     
 Is that what he did to you?     
 Yes.     
 Are you bad now?     
 I'm trying to be better than him.     
 But hunger makes you do weird things.     
 Don't go.     
 I have to.     
 He doesn't know I'm here.     
 I don't want to be alone.     
 You don't have to be.     
 You are more powerful than you realize.     
 You can go anywhere you want.     
 SYKES: Jonas, the way these numbers look, the antiviral can't keep up with the increased viral titer.     
 Then let's just push more antiviral.     
 We can, but it will buy you minutes, not a cure.     
 Fine, then just push every antiviral in the lab.     
 I want to buy every minute available.     
 Okay.     
 Jonas, sit with me.     
 Hold my hand.     
 - FANNING: How are you feeling? 
- [GASPS]     
 Elizabeth, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.     
 You shouldn't have done any of this to me.     
 Elizabeth, you're so close, and I know you're scared, but all you have to do is choose, and you won't regret it, I promise.     
 You can forget about this whole life.     
 I don't want to forget my life.     
 I loved it.     
 You'll have a different life.     
 I don't want it.     
 That's just fear talking.     
 You're scared of dying, right?     
 Oh, and you should be,     
 'cause there is nothing in death but being cold and being alone.     
 But you don't have to go there.     
 I love you.     
 It's okay.     
 You can say yes.

 [TIRES SCREECHING]     
 I have to get to Amy.     
 You know Amy's not Eva.     
 Of course I know that.     
 I just mean that one has nothing to do with the other.     
 Yes, it does.     
 I have a chance.     
 A chance to do what?     
 To make up for what happened.     
 You can't make up for what happened.     
 Lila, I was there.     
 I should've been able to stop the guy, but I didn't.     
 It was my fault.     
 Well, I wasn't there.     
 Maybe it was my fault.     
 Did you ever think about that? Because I have.     
 Lila, no.     
 No, I didn't have to take that surgery.     
 I could have trusted an attending to do it, but I didn't.     
 If I hadn't worked late, if I had gone to the dinner, the whole thing would've played out differently.     
 Everybody lives, and Eva's in the eighth grade right now.     
 Stop.     
 Oh, no, wait, how about this?     
 What if I hadn't forgotten the stupid markers?     
 Then you wouldn't go to the convenience store,     
 Eva would've never brought you your wallet.     
 Everybody lives and we're at home right now making dinner.     
 You know what?     
 I bought the markers at lunch.     
 I just forgot to put them in the box.     
 Lila, it's not your fault, it's not. Please.     
 If you don't blame me, how can you blame you?     
 It was a horrible thing, but I still need you, and I can't have you until you forgive yourself.     
 Can you please just do that?     
 Can we both do that?     
 You don't understand what I did.     
 Then tell me.     
 - LOMAN: Weapons on the ground. 
- [GUN COCKS]     
 Hands in the air.     
 All right, we don't have a lot of time.     
 You need to get out of here. We'll clean this up.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Hey. You with me?     
 I-I'm gonna turn myself in.     
 No, you're not. No, no, no, no, no.     
 It's not your best day, Brad. 
It's not your last, either.     
 I got lost, man. I'm still lost.     
 I don't...     
 - You need a plan. 
- [WOLGAST GRUNTING]     
 You need focus, brother.     
 Something important, something that's gonna, gonna help you get your bearings back.     
 There's nowhere to go.     
 You know that job I'm starting? Project Noah?     
 - It's not just a job. 
- [GROANS]     
 It's a mission that's gonna change the world.     
 This could be good for you.     
 Let me get you out of here.     
 Come on.     
 [THUNDER RUMBLING]   
 LOMAN: Turn around.     
 On your knees.     
 [MOUTHS]     
 [GUNSHOTS]     
 Everybody okay?     
 I don't know, you tell me.     
 [SIGHS]     
 I didn't know what Guilder was doing.     
 Is Amy okay?     
 She's fine.     
 I promised her I'd bring you back.     
 Why should I believe you?     
 Because Project Noah's a horror show.     
 I just wish I'd seen it sooner.     
 You know the training.     
 It's mission before everything.     
 What now?     
 We go back... and get Amy, and get you guys out of here.     
 WOLGAST: You wanted to know how we got here.     
 After Eva died...     
 ...they called me in to identify the guy who killed her.     
 I pretended I didn't recognize him.     
 And then I tracked him down and I killed him.     
 Did it make you feel better?     
 No.     
 It turned me into a monster.     
 It was like a fuse was lit that day.     
 I took the job at Project Noah.     
 And then I got a dozen death row inmates across the country to sign a piece of paper so the government could turn them into monsters, too.     
 I didn't know exactly what was happening to them, but I knew if I asked, I wouldn't like it.     
 So that's how we got here.     
 You have to stick by Amy... whatever happens.     
 No matter what.     
 Martinez, get in here. Let's go over this.     
 Yes, sir.     
 What am I missing?     
 Cameras here and here.     
 Additional retina scanners to access the elevators.     
 - Check. Password randomizer? 
- It's implemented.     
 Changes twice daily.     
 - Two-man rule. 
- Fast-tracked.     
 But if that's not up and running by tomorrow, let me know and I'll crack the whip.     
 The cages now require two keys used simultaneously on separate panels.     
 What about Amy?     
 I have high hopes for her.     
 She's proof of the concept.     
 Fingers crossed, she can turn this colossal failure, waste of money... into a miracle.     
 LEAR: Her fever's   .  and still rising.     
 SYKES: Yeah, and her heart rate is dangerously high.     
 I'm not giving up.     
 She's still fighting.     
 The treatment is prolonging her suffering.     
 Her organs are gonna shut down, and then she'll come to the same fork in the road as the others.     
 Die or become one of them.     
 I'm sorry, Jonas.     
 God knows what he's saying to her.     
 We're almost there, Elizabeth.

 Honey, wake up.     
 Amy?     
 I'm sorry about what I said.     
 Shh...     
 I know you didn't mean it, and it's okay to be upset.     
 I'm sorry I forgot to register you at school.     
 So you're not mad?     
 Of course not.     
 You can just forget all about that now.     
 I miss you.     
 And I miss you.
