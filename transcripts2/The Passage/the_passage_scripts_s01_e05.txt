- FANNING:  This could alter the course of Elizabeth's Alzheimer's.   
 This is for you.   
 No, this is for you.   
 WOLGAST:  She's ten.   
 She needs fresh air.   
 Now we have a bird's-eye view of Project Noah.   
 NEWSMAN: Sierra Thompson died earlier today  in a single-car accident.   
 They killed her.    
 SYKES:  Why did you change your mind about the execution?   
 [SCREAMS]    
 We've got $   million invested per viral.    
 Guess nobody wants to set that much cash on fire.    
 There's a guy on the roof.    
 Amy, Amy.    
 The virals aren't gonna break out. We're gonna let 'em out.    
 No!    
 - I don't want to die. 
- Then don't.

 Whose blood is that?

 AMY: Who's that?    
 Horace Guilder.    
 Deputy director, Department of Defense.    
 You had a rough week, Mark.    
 What the hell's going on around here?    
 We're in uncharted territory.    
 We need to make this thing work.    
 We're a billion dollars in.    
 I need some kind of positive result.    
 Understood.    
 He created several very expensive tactical technology programs.    
 He's famous for taking credit and avoiding blame.    
 My bet is that he's here because of what happened to Paulson.    
 I don't like it.    
 You want me to keep going?    
 No.    
 I just like to know the score.    
 We have that in common.    
 How do you feel about getting the hell out of this place?    
 You got a plan?    
 GUILDER:  I know you have a relationship  with him, but why is Brad Wolgast running around like he's back on the team?    
 The consensus was that it made the little girl more comfortable.    
 - What's her name again? 
- Amy.    
 Amy.    
 When we were up in that tree house, I saw that there's a door outside the mess hall.    
 The cooks prop it open to smoke.    
 Smoking is gross.    
 It is. Never do it.    
 So they probably disabled the alarm on that door,    
 - which means... 
- We use it to sneak out.    
 Then what? We're just standing outside.    
 Use that brain.    
 The slimy old pipe on the edge of the lawn?    
 It's not slimy, and it's not a pipe.    
 It's a drainage tunnel.    
 It's probably been out of service for years.    
 - It'll take us out of here. 
- What about spiders?    
 There are no spiders.    
 Brown widows.    
 You're thinking about them right now.    
 The webs getting in your mouth and your face while you're crawling    
 - through that slimy tunnel. 
- Okay, stop.    
 You in or out?    
 I'm in.    
 I need to meet with Amy alone.    
 Get Wolgast away from her.    
 Can I say again that I think what you're doing is insane?    
 [SIGHS] I was exposed to Carter's blood.    
 - So if I turn... 
- You're not gonna turn.    
 The safest place for me is  B.    
 I'm not gonna be responsible for another person's death.    
 Plus... takes me out of commission while Guilder's here.    
 I'd rather be down with the vampires.    
 We don't say "vampire."    
 [WHISPERS]: Whatever.    
 What are you gonna tell Guilder?    
 The truth.    
 We used science we didn't understand to create a lethal species with superpowers that we can't control, who seem hell-bent on destroying us.    
 Oops.    
 - Yeah. 
- Mm.    
 Let me know how that goes.    
 Listen.    
 If I turn...    
 You're not gonna turn.    
 If I turn...    
 I got you.     
 One shot.     
 Right there. I'll do it myself.     
 Don't wait.

 We shouldn't stop for long.     
 Where are we?     
 Lacey, are you okay?     
 I feel like something terrible is gonna happen.     
 Book of Revelation bad.     
 What do you do when you're feeling lost?     
 I go back to fundamentals.     
 Start from the beginning, find what I missed.     
 I rely on my training.     
 Okay.     
 Let's do that, then.     
 SYKES:  There are things going on  with the test subjects that we've never seen before.     
 The evidence suggests telepathic connection, not just with each other but with us.     
 And it's strategic.     
 They've aggressively targeted people.     
 Hmm. You sound spooked.     
 You dismiss me at your peril, Director Guilder.     
 In my opinion, the only option is to end the experiment and terminate the subjects on  B.     
 The girl, too?     
 No. No, of course not.     
 Amy's an exception.     
 She's doing well.     
 The girl was my idea, sir.     
 She's still within the critical post-injection window, but we're very optimistic.     
 However, we cannot begin to formulate a vaccine until we're sure she won't suffer any side effects.     
 Dr. Sykes, it's the side effects I'm after.     
 Did you know that I recently changed departments?     
 I'm now the deputy director of the Department of Special Weapons.     
 What does the Department of Special Weapons have to do with finding a cure for the avian flu?     
 We have nine other facilities working on the bird flu.     
 I'm here to take Project Noah into a new direction.     
 Your work has unlocked a potential in an area we've been trying to crack for decades.     
 If this girl can read minds...     
 Amy hasn't shown any telepathic abilities.     
 Are you sure? Have you tested her?     
 I would never have given a child the virus so she could be deployed as a weapon.     
 Scientific discoveries are made all the time by accident.     
 Viagra was developed as a heart medication.     
 What a breathtakingly inappropriate analogy.     
 I signed on to Project Noah because of the promise of eradicating diseases, making the world a better place.     
 But now you want to take that work, which, by the way, was a colossal failure, and weaponize it?     
 No one here wants any part of that.     
 It's the biting everyone is worried about.     
 But I have a theory.     
 With deep brain stimulation, we may be able to control them.     
 - You can't be serious. 
- It's a complex procedure, but it could yield the results that you want.     
 Director Guilder, please ignore him.     
 Shut us down.     
 Dr. Pet...     
 I'm granting you    hours to prove her wrong.     
 Okay.     
 The kitchen's gonna be empty soon.     
 - To get to the open door... 
- Down the hall, door's on the right... You said it a hundred times.     
 I literally haven't said it once.     
 Amy... are you reading my mind?     
 Thank you.     
 What am I thinking right now?     
 Amy.     
 Baseball.     
 -   . Blue. 
- [EXHALES SOFTLY]     
 When did this start?     
 It just happens sometimes.     
 I try to stop it, but it's like my brain     
 - won't listen to me. 
- Yeah.     
 Please don't be mad.     
 I'm not mad. I'm not mad.     
 I'm-I'm just...     
 Why didn't you tell me?     
 - I... 
- RICHARDS: Wolgast.     
 Time to go.     
 What? Why?     
 - Amy's got a meeting. 
- Is this with Guilder?     
 - No. No way. 
- Stop it! No!     
 - We had a deal. 
- MAN: Move it.     
 Deal changed.     
 I hate you!     
 Eat your ice cream.     
 The blood of Christ.     
 The blood of Christ.     
 SISTER ARNETTE:  Someone left the back door open, I see.   
 I come in peace, Sister.     
 This is my friend Lila.     
 We need a place to stay.     
 We're in trouble.     
 This is a convent, not a motel, Lacey.     
 I cannot allow whatever storm you're caught in to interrupt things here.     
 Lacey has told me about all the good work you do in your community, and we would love to help out in exchange for your hospitality.     
 You can stay for one night.     
 The leaves will turn soon.     
 It didn't work.     
 None of this brought you back to me.     
 I'm so sorry.     
 Clark.     
 Did you send Amy to talk to Guilder alone without talking to me?     
 He's my boss.     
 Do you know what his agenda is?     
 I follow orders.     
 Just like I did when you asked me to find a kid for you to experiment on.     
 Guilder's interested in Amy for all the wrong reasons.     
 He could take that child and make her into a weapon.     
 And what do you think the military wanted out of this experiment anyway?     
 I called the DoD.     
 They didn't cancel Babcock's execution.     
 You're checking up on me now?     
 Clark.     
 It's just you and me here.     
 And I'm asking as someone who cares about you, is Shauna Babcock in your head?     
 I remember how she was.     
 She-she has a way of drawing people in, and if-if that's what's happened to you, I'll help you.     
 We can deal with this together.     
 I don't know what you're talking about.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Uh, sure hope this doesn't go south for you, Dr. Lear.     
 Yeah.     
 [SIGHS] We'll check back in during rounds, but, uh, just don't... don't look at him.     
 Fanning, I mean.     
 Just, um... don't.     
 LEAR: Graduation is the formality.     
 Your hard work and dedication is what earns you the right to call yourselves doctors.     
 - Hear, hear. 
- [GLASSES CLINKING]     
 When you go forth into the world, you will...     
 When he started talking, it was yesterday.     
 Shh. I'm trying to be supportive.     
 Okay. Can we at least agree that it's gone on kind of long and it's a little boring?     
 - Yes. I'll give you that much. 
- Thank you.     
 Oh.     
 This will help.     
 Thank you.     
 Hey, you're not drinking.     
 Nope. I'm sober. Three months.     
 Wow.     
 Hey, that's great.     
 How's it going?     
 It's horrible. [LAUGHS]     
 - Mm. 
- I hate it.     
 Hey, is he really leaving for Europe? Again?     
 Tomorrow.     
 He's not getting back until close to the holidays this time.     
 How you holding up?     
 LEAR: ...what the job demands of them.     
 Marriages have their ups and downs.     
 LEAR: Tonight...     
 What if he never stops talking?     
 We'll have to get jobs here.     
 You ever waited tables?     
 So that reminds me of the summer I got a job picking apples.     
 Oh, no. [LAUGHS] Not the apple story.     
 Come on. Let me get you out of here.     
 - Let's go. 
- No. I can't. I can't.     
 It would be rude.     
 That's not rude.     
 Rude is not spending his last night in the States alone with you. That is rude.     
 Watch this. Hey, Jonas. Shh, shh.     
 Excuse me. I'm gonna take your wife home.     
 - [GUESTS MURMURING, LAUGHING] 
- Okay.     
 Thank you, Tim. Thanks for leaving your Visa.     
 [LAUGHTER]     
 The doctors tell me what a strong, healthy girl you are, Amy.     
 You pass all their tests with straight As.     
 They don't put letter grades on a medical test.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Sorry I'm late.     
 I didn't realize you were coming.     
 I wouldn't miss it.     
 Please. Go ahead.     
 Thanks.     
 Well, how do you like it here at Project Noah, Amy?     
 Make any friends?     
 Who do you talk to?     
 The agent. Dr. Sykes.     
 And now I'm talking to you.     
 What about Anthony Carter?     
 Dr. Pet tells me you were friends.     
 Maybe you still talk to him now.     
 That's impossible. Carter's gone.     
 Well... this seems like the kind of place where impossible things happen.     
 You're a bad guy.     
 [LAUGHING]: What makes you say that?     
 Amy?     
 Did-did you just read my mind?     
 Can you do that?     
 - Because if you can... 
- I can't.     
 Well, if you could, that'd make you an awfully special person.     
 And isn't that what every kid wants to be? Special?     
 Enough.     
 This meeting's over.     
 It's over when I say it's over.     
 No, Director. I'm still in charge.     
 Now, if you want to strip me of my clearance and relieve me of duty, go ahead, but right now you're upsetting my patient.     
 So we're done.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Can I make a confession? 
I don't like that guy.     
 I don't trust him at all.     
 You and me both. What are you doing?     
 I'm taking that little chip in your neck offline so no one can find you.     
 How would you feel about you and Agent Wolgast busting out of here?     
 Not gonna lie, we were already working on that plan.     
 Good.     
 I want to help.     
 What is this?     
 Where am I?     
 Montrose, Texas is one answer.     
 Have a seat.     
 Anthony, does your friend want something to drink?     
 Yes, ma'am. Thank you.     
 Thank you.     
 He didn't kill that lady.     
 They locked him up for something he didn't do.     
 CARTER: It's all right, it's all right, Gran.     
 It's all right.     
 Love you.     
 She's been dead for three years.     
 One of the benefits, I guess.     
 I can come here any time I want.     
 Watch the road, have some tea.     
 I didn't know how bad Project Noah was.     
 I didn't know about Fanning.     
 Fanning's not your only problem.     
 Guilder wants to turn Amy into a weapon.     
 They think they can control what we are.     
 We'll see how that goes.     
 I'll get her out. I'll save her.     
 There's no saving her.     
 Your chance to save her was back at that foster home.     
 See, the game has changed, bro.     
 Nothing's going down the way you think it will.     
 It's Amy that's the savior.     
 And why should I trust you?     
 I'm here for Amy.     
 Not for Fanning, and certainly not for you.     
 You don't think I've forgotten, Agent.     
 You were my ride into this hell.     
 I'm gonna get her out.     
 We're gonna run away as far as we can.     
 How you gonna outrun the end of the world?     
 Keeping her away from Guilder, that's the easy part.     
 The hard part is getting her ready for what's coming.     
 That's your job now, Agent.     
 [GASPS]     
 Maybe a female subject would be more manageable.     
 That has not been my life experience, Emily.     
 Winston here had a connection with Paulson, so we know he's game.     
 [LOW GROWLING]     
 Yeah, he'll do.     
 You couldn't spring for the valet, huh?     
 Oh, come on. It's just up here.     
 Good. My feet are killing me.     
 These shoes are no joke.     
 I did something a little impulsive, and I want your opinion.     
 Gonna actually need your approval.     
 You bought a car.     
 No.     
 I bought a     , fully restored...     
 You bought a red car with a black stripe.     
 I did.     
 [LAUGHING]: What are you doing?     
 I just... Sometimes I have a hard time accepting that you're actually a scientist.     
 I'm not just a scientist. Technically, I'm a genius, so...     
 You're so braggy, with all your   -year-old girlfriends and this stupid car.     
 You're just hilarious to me.     
 You do understand I'm truly in love with you?     
 And I've never been in love with anyone else in my entire life.     
 Tim... [EXHALES]     
 Damn it.     
 That was our subtext, and...     
 Now it's... it's text.     
 I don't care.

 FANNING: Hey.     
 You don't play  Rumours  for me anymore.     
 What gives?     
 You should have told me that you liked it.     
 I begged for you to kill me.     
 Instead, you put me in a prison.     
 So I haven't felt much like talking to you.     
 Is that it?     
 Or did you just figure out how to do it?     
 [LAUGHS]     
 It's pretty fun.     
 I didn't kill you because...     
 I thought that I could save you.     
 Well, I'm not the one who needs saving now, am I?     
 And I can't believe you let Elizabeth get that bad.     
 I didn't let her. You know she has a progressive disease.     
 Can you even imagine what it's like for her?     
 It's probably the loneliest place in the world.     
 Have you thought about that?     
 I think about that every single day.     
 And yet you could bring her back.     
 [EXHALES] By giving her the virus?     
 So she could be like you? I'd never do that.     
 You know, maybe we should ask her what she wants.     
 Oh, yeah, that's right. You can't communicate with her.     
 I bet I could.     
 You stay away from Elizabeth.     
 Did she ever tell you about that time I drove her home at night?     
 You were all wrapped up with your students, and she was all alone.     
 Again.     
 I'm not doing this.     
 Carter gave me the message.     
 Said we'd already changed the world.     
 What did you mean by that?     
 You'll see.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 What are you doing?     
 Taking you to Amy.     
 There's a shift change in an hour.     
 I can bring you a key card to the loading dock, but there are cameras.     
 That shouldn't be a problem.     
 Dr. Stuart Ross is at Stanford.     
 He heads up infectious diseases.     
 He's someone I trust.     
 I'll bring her to him. I promise.     
 I was scared you weren't gonna make it.     
 [SIGHS] And miss escape night?     
 Never.     
 Guilder was right about one thing.     
 You're a very special little girl.     
 I knew that the minute I met you.     
 There's a light in you, Amy.     
 Never forget that.     
 Goodbye, brave girl.     
 All right, let me just make sure this is good.     
 How's it hanging, Winston?     
 EMILY: He's out.

 Okay.

 How do, fella?     
 - David Winston? 
- Oh.     
 Come on, now. My friends call me Dave.     
 You seem awfully young to be a doctor.     
 Releasing the restraints.     
 Oh.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 You know... [SIGHS]     
 I never got sick in the old life.     
 See, you eat well, you live well, pray hard, all works out in the end.

 Oh, don't mind if I do.     
 Ah.

 Raise your right hand.     
 Put it down.

 I never had an exam like this.     
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]     
 Winston...     
 ...what am I thinking right now?     
 The cingulate gyrus is the key connection to the precuneus.     
 Precuneus? Mmm.     
 What kind of dirty word is that?     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Winston, sit down.     
 You did it.     
 I'm a freaking genius.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 [SHUDDERING EXHALE]: Ooh.     
 Here, put your jacket on. Aren't you cold?     
 No.     
 I don't have a fever.     
 It's just another weird thing I can do.     
 I can run fast, read minds, and I can stay in a refrigerator without a coat.     
 I want you to know that you can tell me anything.     
 All right? I mean, you don't have to handle this on your own.     
 Secrets can make you lonely.     
 Did something happen?     
 I saw Shauna Babcock.     
 It was scary.     
 She says I'm part of their family.     
 No. Amy...     
 She says when I change, you won't want me anymore.     
 Hey, no. I'm not going anywhere.     
 Okay, you want family, that's me.     
 Not them. Me.     
 Why are you so nice to me?     
 I lost someone very precious once.     
 And I got rid of everyone who cared about me, because I thought it would make it easier, you know.     
 And then I realized that I didn't have anyone, and I started doing things that I shouldn't have.     
 Then what happened?     
 I met you.     
 And I believe in you.     
 And then I started to believe in myself.     
 I'm hearing a lot of thoughts.     
 Not just yours... but them.     
 What are they saying?     
 Bad stuff.     
 [SIGHS]     
 What if you started telling a story of your own?     
 You know? That way, you wouldn't have to listen to theirs.     
 I don't have any stories.     
 Oh, come on. Everyone's got stories.     
 Best day ever. Go.     
 I had a bike once.     
 There you go.     
 Yeah? What kind of bike was it?     
 Was it, like, a... like, a BMX bike or a mountain bike, road bike?     
 - Mountain. 
- Mm.     
 From up close, he looks as harmless as a...     
 serial killer.     
 This gonna work?     
 Prepare to have your mind blown.     
 Time for the telepathic connection.     
 [DEVICE HUMMING]     
 It's on. Full power.     
 Excuse me.     
 [TYPING RAPIDLY]     
 Director Guilder, I assure you it worked.     
 Emily was there.     
 - Tell him you saw it. 
- I saw it.     
 Real impressive.     
 Let me know when you have something, Pet.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Hello.     
 Do you remember me?     
 I'm sorry, no.     
 I'm not even sure who I am.     
 I left the house... a long time ago.     
 And now I'm... just lost.     
 You're not lost.     
 I keep feeling like there's something I'm forgetting.     
 I'll help you.     
 I'll stay with you. How about that?     
 [SHUDDERS]     
 It's so cold.     
 I should have brought my sweater.     
 Well, the weather changed.     
 How were you supposed to know that?     
 Maybe I can help.     
 [WIND WHISTLING]     
 [BIRDS TWITTERING]     
 Wow. How did you do that?     
 I'll show you sometime.     
 Your name is Elizabeth, and you are a wonderfully talented writer, and you are a smart, beautiful, hilarious woman.     
 And you are so loved.     
 I don't remember any of that.     
 It's okay.     
 Do we know each other?     
 Yes.     
 We were friends once.     
 I'm Tim.     
 And I'm gonna get you out of here.     
 [GROWLING]     
 Someone is gonna have to explain to me how Agent Wolgast and the girl are both missing.     
 Lock the place down, find them.     
 BABCOCK: I have some news.     
 I'm pregnant.     
 What do you want to do?     
 I'm kidding.     
 Obviously... I mean, we haven't even had s*x.     
 I don't have time for this.     
 Nichole is really making you look bad here, Clark Richards.     
 Don't even say her name.     
 I know where she took Amy and the agent.     
 Why should I believe you?     
 Because we're getting out of here real soon, Clark Richards.     
 And when we do...     
 I'm taking you with me.     
 She hid 'em in the blood cooler.     
 [DOOR OPENING]     
 Let's go.     
 You ever wonder where they get this stuff from?     
 Rabbits, I heard.     
 That's a lot of dead bunnies.     
 - [DOOR CLOSES] 
- You good?     
 It's you I'm worried about. Your heart's pounding.     
 - That's not good at your age. 
- How old do you think I am?     
 - Don't answer that. 
- [DOOR OPENS]     
 Hey! What are you doing here?     
 People are looking for you.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 - [THUDDING] 
- WOLGAST: Come on.     
 Can't wait for Sykes. Let's go.     
 LACEY:  Back when I lived here,   
 Sister Arnette used to call it "a stirring."     
 That feeling that you were called to a higher purpose.     
 Truth be told, I thought it was BS.     
 It's part of why I left.     
 But tonight, I realized it's happening to me now.     
 Amy is my calling.     
 My job is to protect that child and all the promise she holds out to the world.     
 How I'll proceed is anyone's guess, but...     
 I'll be damned. I'm finally feeling a stirring.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Please don't let anything happen to Brad.     
 Please don't let anything happen to Amy.     
 [FLOORBOARD CREAKS]     
 [MUFFLED GRUNTING]     
 You want to tell me what's going on?     
 I don't know.     
 I want you upstairs until we find Brad and Amy.     
 I hope you never find them.     
 All right, Winston.     
 You and me.     
 Hey, brother.     
 I haven't even started stimulation.     
 You want to play that guessing game again?     
 Come on.     
 - Ask me to read your thoughts. 
- No.     
 You're really regretting coming down here all alone, ain't you?     
 You weren't like this before.     
 Well, you can tell a lot about a person when you let 'em think they're more powerful than you are.     
 That's what I did with the whores, and that worked every time.     
 Okay, what-what just happened?     
 Those were killing me. Thank you.     
 Who turned off the lights?     
 You did, Doc.     
 Who opened the door?     
 You did, Dr. Pet.     
 Now, I suggest you run.     
 Jonas!     
 Jonas, help.     
 Help me.     
 - What? 
- Please help me. Help me.     
 Geez.     
 [GROWLS]     
 [ALARM BLARING]     
 Help! Help! Somebody help!     
 [SNARLS]     
 [ALARM BLARING]     
 - Is that for us? 
- Maybe.     
 - What are we gonna do? 
- Move faster.     
 My book. I left it behind.     
 We can't go back. Let's go.     
 [BREATHING HEAVILY]     
 Well, this is a curveball.     
 Bad for you. Bad for me.     
 Get out.     
 Good news, though.     
 You're not infected.     
 Elizabeth told me all about her night with you.     
 Yeah, I already knew.     
 She messed up.     
 And then we fixed it.     
 We fixed it because we love each other and our marriage is more important than some stupid mistake.     
 And then we moved on.     
 Clearly, you never did.     
 And I'm beginning to think that's what all this is about.     
 You lost, and you'll never get over it.     
 She never loved you.     
 She never will.     
 You sure about that?     
 Hey, guard! Guard, let me out of here!     
 Let me out!     
 [ALARM BLARING]     
 Elizabeth?     
 Elizabeth.     
 Jonas?     
 What? How?     
 I-I don't know...but I'm here.     
 No.     
 Not through there.     
 That's the way to the kitchen.     
 It gets us to the drainage tunnel.     
 Come on.     
 I can hear him.     
 [GROWLING]     
 Amy, run!     
 [GROWLING]     
 [GASPS]     
 [GROWLS]     
 Amy, go!     
 [HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM]     
 [PANTING]     
 [GROANING]     
 You just did that.     
 I just did that.     
 We're okay. We're okay.
