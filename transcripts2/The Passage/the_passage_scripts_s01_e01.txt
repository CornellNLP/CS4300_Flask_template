 ♪ ♪   
 My name is Amy Bellafonte.   
 I didn't used to believe in monsters, but I do now.   
 I saw them change everything.   
 It didn't start with me.   
 It started with two lifelong friends   
 who wanted to make the world a better place.   
 This is crazy, pal.   
 I mean, how many days we've been walking now?    
 I still can't believe I gave that punk my watch.    
 Suits him. Elevates his status.    
 FANNING: I don't think he knows where he's going.    
 - LEAR: I think we're close. 
 FANNING: I think we're lost. Yo!    
 We almost there yet?    
 Hey, Fanning, he still doesn't speak English.    
 Maybe we can't find your guy 'cause he doesn't exist.    
 You know, if it's true, we change the world.    
 You skeptical, Richards?    
 Of your magical    -year-old man?    
 Oh, who cares what I think?    
 The DOD and the CDC believe in you, Lear, so here we are.

 SOLDIER: He says your guy's in that cave.    
 This is as far as he'll take us.    
 SOLDIER  : Careful.    
 SOLDIER  : Eyes up.    
 Oh, my God.    
 It's him.    
 [MAN WHEEZING HEAVILY]    
 Why the hell is he in a cage?    
 What's that kid doing?    
 Is he sick?    
 Hey, Tim. Tim, no.    
 FANNING: Hey, what's going on?    
 [BOY SPEAKING SPANISH]

- [BOY SHOUTING IN SPANISH]    
 What's he saying?    
 Jararaca.  Vampire.    
 FANNING: Hey, we're doctors. We can help.    
 Is he sick?    
 Fanning, get away from the cage!

 AMY:  Dr. Lear thought his friend was dead.   
 FANNING: Jonas.    
 AMY:  But death would've been better.   
 LEAR: Oh, my God.    
 Tim.    
 You're alive.    
 Your neck.    
 [FANNING LAUGHS SOFTLY]    
 How is this possible?    
 I don't know. [INHALES]    
 But I feel amazing, Jonas.    
 I think we found what we're looking for.    
 We're going to change the world.    
 You're bleeding.    
 I am?    
 AMY:  What they discovered in that cave   
 set everything in motion.   
 Project Noah was born.   
 PRISON GUARD: Just what the hell is Project Noah anyway?    
 - What, you boys building some type of ark? 
 [LOCK BUZZES]    
 That him?    
 Mr. Carter, we represent a government   
 medical organization called Project Noah.    
 We're on the verge of an exciting breakthrough    
 that can improve the lives of all Americans.    
 A drug that makes people immune to disease.    
 Infectious diseases like AIDS, Ebola, SARS.    
 What does this have to do with me?    
 In exchange for commuting your execution,    
 you have the opportunity to take part in a drug trial.    
 You won't be the first, either.    
 Martin Echols, John Baffes,    
 a young lady named Shauna Babcock, all people    
 who were facing execution, and now they're in Colorado,    
 enjoying the scenery.    
 Are any of those people you just mentioned    
 available to speak about their experience at Project Noah?    
 DOYLE: You're a murderer on death row.    
 It doesn't look to me like you have that many options.    
 This is a take it or leave it deal.    
 How about I leave it, then?    
 Anthony, of course you have a choice.    
 And, yes, this is unusual.    
 But you're gonna be executed.    
 That's gonna be the end of your story.    
 What I'm offering you instead is time.     
 I can give you an ocean of time.     
 AMY:  So many things led to what happened.   
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 It was the perfect storm.   
 SYKES:  Listen up.   
 I just got off the phone with the CDC     
 and the Department of Defense.     
 The Chinese avian flu has gone from outbreak to epidemic.     
 Now, our intelligence has put the death toll at   ,   .     
 It's airborne, it mutates fast, and there's no vaccine.     
 What's the incubation period?     
    hours.     
 You get exposed at breakfast, you're dead by dinner.     
 We're looking at a global pandemic.     
 How long until that hits the U.S.?     
 Three months if they can't contain it.     
 But the CDC think the work we're doing     
 is our best hope for a vaccine.     
 Well, we haven't brought a subject safely through trial.     
 I mean, we're nowhere near ready.     
 I'm aware of that, Dr. Lear.     
 So, how do we get ready?     
 We could try incubating in mammalian vero cells.     
 No, that would take too long.     
 You need extended passaging with antitryptic activity.     
 I got something. Nobody's gonna like it, though.     
 Yeah, well, I have a very open mind right now.     
 Let's go down to the cells.     
 It'll be easier to explain there.     
 [DOCTORS MURMURING]     
 Tim Fanning.   
 Patient zero.     
 He was    when he was infected in Bolivia three years ago.     
 The exposure threw his immune system into hyperdrive.     
 But after a short period of accelerated healing,     
 he declined into this.     
 He's immune to disease, but he's also     
 a lethal bloodsucking monster, who we are all very careful     
 not to call a vampire.     
 Is there a point to this recap?     
 Setting the table.     
 Stay with me.     
 Then came the murderers: John Baffes,     
 Victor Chavez, Kathy Turrell, Rupert Sosa.     
 We attenuated the formula with each subject.     
 Each one had a longer period of good health before the decline,     
 with less side effects.     
 Still lethal and ugly as hell,     
 but we're getting close.     
 Echols, Martinez.     
 June Reinhardt, the white supremacist.     
 She was delightful.     
 Then we get to Shauna Babcock.     
 Subject   . The best result yet.     
 She took    days to decline.     
 And when she did, her vital signs     
 and appearance remained human.     
 We exposed her to Ebola, HIV, measles.     
 She's immune to all of it.     
 And she can still rip your head off     
 and drink you like a Jamba Juice.     
 Well, yes, okay. Nobody's perfect.     
 But we're making progress.     
 It's not just tweaks to the formula, it's age.     
 The formula attacks neurons.     
 Younger people have more neurons.     
 The more neurons, the less severe the decline.     
 How old is Anthony Carter?     
 He's   . Arrives tomorrow.     
 We should move forward with him, but he's not young enough.     
 Don't even say it.     
 Are you suggesting we try with a child?     
 Yes.     
 Children have billions more neurons than adults.     
 A child would come through with zero side effects.     
 You wanted a solution. This is it.     
 [BREATHING HEAVILY]     
 How far did you go?     
 [BREATHING HEAVILY]     
 Six miles, maybe.     
 How'd you know where I was?     
 I know where everybody is. It's my job.     
 You okay?     
 I spent all day trying to punch holes in Pet's research.     
 But it holds up.     
 I think he's right.     
 I can't believe I'm saying this,     
 but how feasible is it to find a child?     
 Can you live with this?     
 No. It's hideous.     
 But it's either I live with it or millions of people die.     
 Can you find a child?     
 Can you do that?     
 Yeah. I can do it.     
 Just a matter of finding a kid with no family,     
 no paper trail with social services.     
 Someone no one will miss.     
 BOY: Come on! You got it! You got it!     
 You got it! You got it!

 but I think it's time for you to lose.     
 Ah, damn.     
 Here, have it. You won.     
 I mean, I had plans for that money, but whatever.     
 We got to go.     
 Where'd you move here from?     
 Georgia. Before that, Baton Rouge.     
 Want to come to our house for dinner?     
 My mom won't care.     
 Oh, no, I got to get home, too.     
 My mom'll get mad if I miss dinner.     
 MAN: Did you shut down the fryers?     
 MAN  : No, let's do that right now.     
 WAITRESS: We're closing. You got someplace to go?

 No, ma'am. She works nights.
