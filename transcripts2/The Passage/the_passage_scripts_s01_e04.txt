 Previously on The Passage...   
 Amy, I'll find you.   
 I promise.   
 - Euthanize her. 
- Okay.   
 But you won't fix the real problem.   
 - Which is? 
- The nightmares.   
 There are a lot of sick people in the world, and you could help us save millions of them.   
 I want the agent.    
 Don't look at that. Look at me.    
 He's gonna come for her.    
 - Who? 
- Fanning.    
 I guess now is a good time to talk.    
 In the last three years,   death row inmates were sent to a government facility in Colorado to be used as guinea pigs for top secret medical experiments.    
 I'll look into this.    
 Stay out of my way, Agent Wolgast.    
 It's time, Carter.    
 You're gonna have to make a choice.    
 What are you doing?    
 Carter had another nightmare.    
 He has them all the time now.    
 Is that a part of this?    
 Is that gonna happen to me?    
 Are you having nightmares?    
 No. But all I do all day is sit around and think what drug they put in me.    
 And if I get sick, what will happen to me?    
 Is that gonna happen to me?    
 No, it's not gonna happen to you, 'cause we're gonna get out of here. 
- How?    
 All I know is the hallway to the elevator to the bathroom.    
 And there's men outside with guns every ten feet...    
 - ...and you said you would get us out of here. 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.    
 - And you didn't get us out of here. 
- Hey.    
 What did I say we were not gonna do? Huh?    
 - Panic. 
- Panic. And what are you doing right now?    
 - Panicking. 
- You're panicking.    
 I'm gonna get us out of here.    
 What are you gonna do?    
 I'm gonna broaden our horizons.    
 What is it?    
 I have to see Dr. Lear right away.    
 - What for? 
- I have all that.    
 Why do you care so much about the virals' brain activity?    
 I think we're witnessing an evolution.    
 We need to understand it, in case we need to defend ourselves.    
 From bad dreams? Wow.    
 You're like my mom who says cell phones give you brain cancer.    
 Cell phones do give you brain cancer.    
 See? It's just what I suspected.    
 Their brain activity peaks overnight.    
 These...    
 These nightmares can't be unrelated.    
 Maybe it's just static, but...    
 But what if it is communication?    
 Who's this?    
 The intensity of the EM field is exponentially higher than all the others.    
 Fanning.    
 Sir, I've got Wolgast for you.    
 Says he wants to talk to you and Dr. Sykes.    
 Amy's not sleeping. She's anxious.    
 Yeah, that's been going around. What can we do?    
 I think, for a start, you can get her out of that room.    
 She's ten.    
 She needs fresh air. Go outside. Diversion.    
 D.O.D. has some security concerns.    
 Mostly about you.    
 They can afford an outdoor security detail.    
 I'm not Harry Potter.    
 Okay. Tell me what you need.    
 I just wanted to say thank you for what you did.    
 I wouldn't think too much about it.    
 If you really want to thank me, you can just get out of my head.    
 We got another problem.    
 One of your soldiers is going a little crazy.    
 What are you talking about?    
 You're gonna have to take care of him.    
 "Take care of him." What does that mean?    
 He's gonna blow the whistle on this whole place.    
 If what's going on here gets out, you're going to be held responsible, and then I'm gonna get euthanized.    
 I don't think you know what you're talking about, Shauna.    
 My people are fine.    
 Trust any one of them with my life.    
 Okay. I guess we'll just wait and see what happens.    
 Richards, we need you in the cell block.    
 We have a problem with Sergeant Paulson.    
 Copy.    
 Paulson.     
 What's the problem?     
 Sir, you know David Winston?     
 Yeah.     
 Met him briefly on the way in.     
 How have you been, Winston?     
 He drove long-haul truck for    years.     
 One day he found a girl, and he raped her.     
 He strapped her underneath his rig and finished his route from Seattle to Bozeman with her under there.     
 Then he went on a five-year killing spree.     
 All right, listen to me.     
 You don't need to learn their stories.     
 Yeah, well, he didn't give me much of a choice, did he?     
 It's a lot like you and Shauna Babcock.     
 You know what he says to me?     
 - He tells me he loves me. 
- Randy, this is what, our third tour now?     
 I brought you along     
 - because I trust you. 
- These things can do     
 whatever they want, and no one can stop 'em.     
 I mean, you can, but Babcock won't let you, you know?     
 I want you to report to the medic right now.     
 You need a full psych eval.     
 Babcock is playing you.     
 Listen to me.     
 You need to wake up.     
 We are sworn to protect the lives in this facility until these lab rats give us the cure that we need.     
 We've just been here too long.     
 How do you know we're not the lab rats?     
 You know, I can't believe they let you do this to me.     
 What are you talking about?     
 My dad and I built a treehouse when I was your age.     
 Just like this.     
 You know, minus the guards.     
 It was awesome.     
 So is basketball.     
 I'd murder you at basketball.     
 Go ahead, make it yours.     
 Add any changes.     
 Okay, one big ground rule here.     
 We handle all the construction tools, with one exception: hammer.     
 Yay.     
 All right, let's see what you got.     
 All right, this is a great start.     
 Lot of imagination here. I like it.     
 We'll start on the ladder.     
 Don't wander outside the perimeter, or we'll have to shoot you.     
 Yup. Got it.     
 See, Amy? Fun.     
 Amy.     
 What's wrong with this picture?     
 Come on up.     
 We built this for you.     
 Come on.     
 You're afraid of heights.     
 - No. 
- I'm not gonna make fun of you.     
 - You already are. 
- No. What about when you climbed down that ladder the first day we met?     
 I was more scared of you than heights.     
 Focus on where you're going.     
 Come on. Take that step.     
 There you go. Don't look down.     
 Look up. Look at me.     
 Look into these beautiful hazel eyes.     
 - Gross. 
- Come on, you're doing great.     
 Come on.     
 I got you.     
 All right.     
 There you go.     
 You made it up. All right.     
 Good.     
 Tell me what you see.     
 Same things I see every day.     
 Not exactly.     
 Now we have a bird's-eye view of Project Noah and what's on the other side of that security wall.     
 Wow.     
 That's genius.     
 Don't act so surprised.     
 I got skills.     
 All right, Anthony. This all looks good.     
 The dreams are worse.     
 It's happening every time I close my eyes.     
 It's the same guy. Fanning.     
 Who is he?     
 Come on, tell me, man.     
 Tim Fanning... was the most brilliant man I ever knew.     
 Also one of the most manipulative.     
 What happened to him?     
 I can't tell you that.     
 Okay, well, he's coming for me.     
 He says I have to make a choice.     
 What kind of choice?     
 I don't know, Dr. Lear.     
 I always wake up before we get to the Q and A part.     
 You know, Anthony, you have a very good chance of coming through this trial without any side effects.     
 You're different.     
 How?     
 You're young. You're strong.     
 And you're the first test subject who hasn't tried to convince me of your innocence.     
 You know I read your case file, right?     
 So you know everything about me?     
 I know your court-appointed lawyer fell asleep during the trial.     
 Yeah, well, you get what you pay for.     
 I also know Project Innocence offered to take on your case, and you turned them down.     
 What are we doing here?     
 See...     
 I don't know what happened to Rachel Wilson, but I think her death is clearly a burden on you.     
 Hey.     
 I have some great news.     
 What?     
 They've got the tater tots back in the cafeteria.     
 Oh, did you call in a favor to get that?     
 Oh, yeah. Meet me upstairs when your shift's over.     
 I'll have ketchup.     
 Sure.     
 As long as we don't have to talk about work.     
 Well, then...     
 I'll have to ask you something now.     
 I've been, uh, getting questions about the Babcock thing.     
 Why did you change your mind about the execution?     
 Last minute, I called the D.O.D., let them know that we were using deadly force.     
 They said absolutely not.     
 Told me to stand down.     
 Why would they overrule your decision?     
 She killed someone.     
 Well, we've got $   million invested per viral.     
 I guess nobody wants to set that much cash on fire.     
 Oh. Okay.     
 Hi.     
 Welcome.     
 Uh, you here for the open house?     
 I was just driving by and had to pop in.     
 Okay.     
 Rachel Wilson, RW & A Realty.     
 Anthony Carter.     
 And thanks for coming, but I'm not looking for any help on this.     
 No, you're not looking to pay a commission.     
 Am I right?     
 I try to only pay for things I can't do myself.     
 Give me the confidence of a first-time home flipper.     
 Look around.     
 Everything in here is top-of-the-line.     
 - Yeah, I mean, you have a great eye. 
- Yeah.     
 Expensive taste, but... you've been on the market     
   % longer than average, with no bites.     
 Let me help you.     
 How?     
 How about a freebie?     
 Okay.     
 Kitchen. Solid layout.     
 Sink and the stove are an A-plus.     
 - Appreciate it. 
- So, wait, this-this can't be the only fridge in here.     
 It's a totally new, energy-efficient technology...     
 Yeah, but it doesn't have any room for groceries, so... maybe swap it out.     
 Yeah.     
 That's such a good stove.     
 Ugh! What is this?     
 - That is an apple. 
- Mm-mm, no.     
 It's a pop of color.     
 This is good.     
 Let's see where we need more of this.     
 Wh-What?     
 Anthony, the bed's in the corner.     
 What's wrong...?     
 Have you never lived with a woman?     
 - Ever? 
- I have an active dating life.     
 - Uh-huh. 
- I-I just enjoy having space to myself.     
 Okay, now I get it.     
 That's the problem.     
 This house is a pure expression of what's in your heart.     
 I mean, it's the perfect home for a young couple.     
 You know, two people in love, ready to start a life together.     
 But you do these little things to... to sabotage it, and I don't even think you're doing them on purpose.     
 I swear I've never said this in a business context, but... open up your heart, Anthony.     
 Let love in.     
 Could have just said, "Move the bed."     
 God.     
 ♪ In the way you move ♪     
 ♪ And she catch the groove... ♪     
 Do you want me to ask you out?     
 Yeah, I guess I do.     
 Good job, buddy.     
 She's a catch.     
 Watch your fingers.     
 How you feeling? Anything different?     
 Hot? Cold? How you sleeping?     
 I feel great.     
 I'm worried about Carter, though.     
 - He sounded sick. 
- I'm sure he's fine, but I'll ask Dr. Lear, okay?     
 Looks like we're done here.     
 There you go.     
 Thanks.     
 Hey.     
 May I use your binoculars?     
 Come on, I've never been to Colorado.     
 I don't know if I'll ever see nature again.     
 Our secret.     
 Thank you.     
 You're scaring me.     
 Just doing what you do, Agent.     
 You can call me Brad. That's my name.     
 Your name is The Agent.     
 - So, what do I look at? 
- South-southeast.     
 Tell me everything you see over the border wall.     
 Shauna Babcock,   years old, got the death penalty for the murder of her own mother and stepfather.     
 Her official date of execution passed five months ago, but the execution never happened.     
 It was two men.     
 They said they were FBI.     
 They spoke to the warden.     
 Put Babcock in the back of their car, and that was it, she was gone.     
 Classified records obtained by WWN detail close to a dozen victims, death row inmates just like Babcock, with no one to speak up for them... until now.     
 I'm going to start watching cable news again, just for you.     
 Did you make the connection to Telluride?     
 Everything you said checked out.     
 It's all in there.     
 News vans could be there tomorrow.     
 Hey, so I've gone after some powerful people before, and it can get pretty scary.     
 If you need security...     
 She brought me along.     
 Well, we go to air tomorrow at  :   p.m., so... until then, just lay low.     
 I'm calling to follow up on the conversation you had with Clark Richards.     
 Yeah. He-he said that you spoke about our decision to have Shauna Babcock put down.     
 He didn't?     
 Are you sure?     
 Okay, thank you.     
 This E.M. surge from Fanning is    % higher than anything we saw yesterday.     
 What the hell's going on?     
 We got to get him downstairs.     
 Okay, we got to move him now! Move, move! Help me!     
 Stupid trees.     
 Stupid birds.     
 Mountains.     
 Hey.     
 There's a guy on the roof.     
 What's he look like?     
 He has a big gun, and he's...     
 - Get down! 
- Take cover!     
 Body temperature's    .  and rising.     
 How long has he been like this?     
 - Is it too late? 
- No.     
 No, I'm not gonna lose you.     
 - Did you pull up his blood? 
- Got it right here.     
 This is a snapshot of Carter's viral genome, from a few days ago, and this is a sample from today.     
 Look. Every time we attenuate the formula,     
 - it mutates back. 
- Okay, what if we     
 synthesize a new injection, excise the bad nucleotides?     
 - How long will it take? 
- Not long. We just need to pull the sample and run the knock-out sequence.     
 ♪ You've been out too long... ♪     
 What is that?     
 Those are gunshots.     
 The shooter's got to be on the northwest rooftop.     
 Spread out, find your shot.     
 We've got an active shooter!     
 Down, down, down, down, down, down.     
 Richards, this is Paulson. I'm the man on the roof.     
 Damn it, Paulson. How the hell you expect this to end?     
 - With me on a helicopter out of here. 
- Listen to me.     
 If you end this now, I will pull every string I have to get the D.O.D. to go easy on you, but if you kill anyone, all bets are off.     
 I don't want anyone to die, Richards, but you wouldn't listen to me.     
 I don't know what else to do.     
 I got a clear shot on the electric substation.     
 The backups are in there, too.     
 I can take out power to this entire compound.     
 I need a helicopter. Find it.     
 Okay, listen to me. We're gonna make a run for it.     
 You see those men over there?     
 - That's our finish line. 
- It's too far.     
 No, it won't be once we start running.     
 Stay behind me, you got it?     
 Three... two...     
 one...     
 Go!     
 Stay low. Amy. Amy!     
 Everyone make it in one piece?     
 Yeah. We're good.     
 Thanks.     
 Fever's    . . His fever's getting worse.     
 We're nearly there.     
 What happened?     
 We lost power.     
 Sykes, it's Richards.     
 Paulson took out the electrical substation.     
 Saying he wants a helicopter.     
 There's a bad situation going on with Carter.     
 We need power back now, but I can't send a repair team with Paulson on that rooftop.     
 All right, give me a minute.     
 Let me go talk to him.     
 I can get a cease-fire.     
 I'm gonna take Wolgast to the roof with me.     
 Paulson's not talking to me, but he might get through to him.     
 He was a negotiation specialist in our unit.     
 Okay, get an escort for Amy.     
 Send her to me, and I'll keep her safe.     
 On it.     
 Sykes will look after you.     
 More ice.     
 We need to bring his fever down.     
 Oh, Rachel.     
 I'm sorry, do zombies live here?     
 No one lives here. That's the point, smart-ass.     
 Yeah.     
 Come on.     
 Hey, what are we doing here?     
 Okay, so I know we said no gifts for our three months, but... I saw this place for us.     
 And it's perfect.     
 I mean, look at it.     
 Babe, I don't get it.     
 I mean, what's this 
place have to do with us?     
 This place is  ,    square feet, and I could get it for nothing.     
 We could flip it, take the money and start our life together.     
 I just finished selling my first house, and this-this is a big step up from a three-bedroom ranch.     
 I-I'm just a one-man operation.     
 What about me?     
 - Babe. 
- I'm sorry, did you sell that place     
 - all by yourself? 
- No. No.     
 You and I are a team, but I don't have a crew or the right suppliers...     
 Why are you always so negative?     
 - Why can't you trust me? 
- Whoa.     
 I have so much faith in you, Anthony.     
 I believe in you, but you never trust that.     
 Babe, th-this is just about the house.     
 Well, I already made the deal.     
 I closed escrow yesterday.     
 I'm sorry.     
 I thought this would be a good opportunity for us.     
 But it's not your problem.     
 Nothing's in your name.     
 I will figure it out.     
 Okay.     
 Okay.     
 I'll-I'll make a few calls, and I'll pull a crew together.     
 Yes!     
 Yes!     
 We can do this.     
 Hey, you can do this.     
 You are crazy, you know that?     
 - Crazy. 
- Yeah, well...     
 maybe you need a little crazy.     
 - Maybe I do. 
- Yeah.     
 Mm-hmm.     
 My God, Anthony.     
 You're burning up.     
 All right, he's too hot. He's gonna seize.     
 I need some more ice.     
 I-I don't know what's happening.     
 You still haven't figured it out yet?     
 His temperature's    .     
 We're out of time.     
 Without power, we're gonna lose him.     
 How did this get out of hand so quickly?     
 It's Fanning. He's drawing energy from the other virals.     
 I don't know, maybe there's some snowball effect that's making the virus mutate faster.     
 That's crazy.     
 Well, that's where we are.     
 I can hear everything you say. Don't try anything stupid.     
 - Why do you think he snapped? 
- This place is a pressure cooker, and he's been here since day one.     
 You can't give me anything else? Specifics? It'll help.     
 Here's all you need to know:     
 We started this place to save lives, and I don't need the body count getting any higher.     
 Just get through to him.     
 
 
 
 Let me see your hands!     
 - Let me see your hands! 
- Wait. Don't shoot.     
 I'm alone. Don't shoot.     
 - Don't shoot. 
- Step out from the door.     
 All right, I'm working on your helicopter, but there's a problem.     
 Place your hands behind your head.     
 Walk backwards to me.     
 You're Paulson, right? 
My name is Wolgast.     
 Stop.     
 I'm unarmed.     
 We have a medical emergency downstairs.     
 We need the power restored now.     
 That's on you. You could have a chopper here in minutes if you made the right call.     
 We both know the people that you're dealing with.     
 They'll blow this entire rooftop with you and me on it.     
 I planned for that.     
 What did you do?     
 Slowly.     
 I used my access to  B, and I smuggled a vial of Fanning's blood out of here.     
 And you're never gonna track it down without my help.     
 Here we go.     
 We have breaking news.     
 A tragedy involving one of our own investigative reporters:     
 Sierra Thompson died earlier today in a single-car accident.     
 - We need to go. 
- We have Kurt Wisner     
 - on the scene. 
- They killed her.     
 We need to go now, Lila.     
 Uh, thanks, Brian. What I have so far...     
 Vitals are still stable, but he seems hot.     
 My God. Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe.     
 What happened? Are you okay?     
 Here. S-Sit down. Sit down.     
 Did someone hit you?     
 I need a minute.     
 And a drink.     
 Okay, okay.     
 Here you go.     
 Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.     
 Come on.     
 You're okay.     
 I'm married.     
 - Oh, no, no, no, no. 
- No, you don't...     
 - you don't understand. 
- No, I didn't understand before.     
 But I understand now.     
 I'm such an idiot.     
 Listen, I know...     
 I know it's asking a lot and I don't deserve anything from you, but can you please let me explain?     
 No. I-I never cared that you act crazy, but now y-you're a liar.     
 - I'm-I'm gonna get out of here. 
- Anthony, Anthony, please.     
 - Please, please, Anthony. 
- I don't want to look     
 - at you right now. 
- Please... please don't.     
 Please, please don't. Please.     
 Can you please just listen to me, okay?     
 Please. I know, I know.     
 I know. I'm sorry.     
 Don't worry.     
 You'll see him soon.     
 He's nice, right?     
 I'm not so bad, either.     
 Who are you?     
 You know me.     
 Come on, try.     
 Relax your brain.     
 Pretend like we've been friends forever.     
 There it is.     
 Right? My name. Tell me.     
 Shauna Babcock.     
 I know you, too.     
 You're Amy from Memphis, whose mama overdosed.     
 I'm sorry about that.     
 I know it's hard to lose a parent.     
 Where are you right now?     
 Really?     
 Smart girl.     
 I'm down in the basement locked up.     
 Show me the real you.     
 Are you sure?     
 - It's a little scary. 
- Yeah.     
 - I am. 
- Okay.     
 I'll show you.     
 I'm gonna change right back, though, okay?     
 I'm nothing like you.     
 But you are.     
 You're changing already.     
 You can feel that, right?     
 I know you're scared, but after you change, you're not gonna need anybody to protect you.     
 You're finally gonna have a family.     
 We're gonna look out for you.     
 All you have to do is give in.     
 Fighting only makes it harder.     
 Ask that poor guy on the roof with the gun.     
 Or ask Carter.     
 I don't want anything to do with you.     
 Why? You don't have anybody.     
 I have the agent.     
 Trust me, he's gonna have a hard time with all this.     
 Just promise me one thing.     
 Don't let anybody tell you what to think.     
 Listen to you.     
 You know what's best.     
 I want you to go now.     
 I get it.     
 But if you want to talk, I'm around.     
 I'm gonna get someone to check the blood locker to see if Paulson's bluffing, but if he's not, you need to get the location of that vial.     
 Do whatever it takes.     
 You know if that blood gets out, it's a disaster.     
 It's the only way I can get people to listen to me.     
 You're on the wrong side of this.     
 Not anymore. I want this place shut down, too.     
 Great.     
 Did we finally get to the "gain his trust" chapter of the hostage negotiation handbook?     
 I've been on  B.     
 I've seen what they've turned those people into.     
 And I know about the dreams.     
 I know they're real.     
 Who'd you get in your head?     
 Fanning.     
 No one knew what this was gonna be.     
 And they can't even admit what it is they've done.     
 We don't have much more time.     
 Let me help you.     
 We can work together.     
 Two's not enough to stop them.     
 What are you talking about?     
 Winston told me everything.     
 The virals aren't gonna break out.     
 We're gonna let 'em out.     
 They can't control us.     
 - Not to do something like that. 
- Ask Richards.     
 Ask him about Babcock.     
 He saved her life, and you want to know why?     
 It's because Fanning needs all of them alive, and when he gets one more, that's when...     
 No!     
 I told you I could talk him down.     
 Target down is confirmed. 
Target down is confirmed.     
 I need a repair crew ASAP.     
 I gave you as much time as you deserve.     
 What about Fanning's blood?     
 All the vials are accounted for on  B.     
 You pulled that trigger to shut him up.     
 He was a raving lunatic, and he put my men in the line of fire.     
 Was he right about Babcock?     
 And who's the "one more"?     
 - What's going on? 
- When were you down on  B?     
 What are you Ta...? That was a bluff.     
 I said that to get him to trust me.     
 Oh, it sure is funny timing, considering the security incident we just had.     
 We don't have time to be at each other's throats.     
 There's trouble coming.     
 Okay. If trouble comes, I'll handle it.     
 Jonas.     
 It's Fanning, isn't it?     
 You need to push him out.     
 I'm gonna help you through.     
 Thank God. All right.     
 Let's prep him for the antiviral.     
 Come on, let's move.     
 I thought I could get out of the marriage without you ever knowing.     
 It's him.     
 Give me that.     
 - Give it to me. 
- I...     
 She'll call you when she has something to say.     
 So, what happens now?     
 I love you, Rachel, but...     
 I need time to think.     
 ♪ ♪     
 ♪ You need to come home now ♪     
 ♪ You've been out too long ♪     
 ♪ Yeah, the sun is going down... ♪     
 Temperature's spiking.     
 Negative. Current one's already giving an accurate reading.     
 - Set it up again. 
- No progress.     
 Come on, Carter.     
 Negative effect.     
 Rachel?     
 Rachel.     
 Rachel. Rachel.     
 Baby, breathe.     
 Please.     
 Rachel, please breathe.     
 Come on, babe.     
 Baby, breathe.     
 Hmm.     
 I can see how this was tough to explain.     
 That's the problem with being the sidepiece.     
 When push comes to shove, you just don't matter.     
 Now you got the rich, angry husband after you.     
 He definitely hates her more than he hates you, but either way, he's telling the cops that you're the one that hit her.     
 What's happening?     
 You're dying, Carter.     
 My God. What's Fanning doing to him?     
 - Guys, we need more ice. 
- More. Get it in here.     
 You've been playing this scene on a loop in your head for the past two years, and every single time, she ends up dead.     
 And every single time, you get framed for her murder.     
 So why'd you go down without a fight?     
 I...     
 I could've helped her.     
 I could've...could've just said I forgave her.     
 Oh, my God.     
 Can I reframe this for you, please?     
 She was a mentally ill, selfish drug addict.     
 No, you don't know a thing about her.     
 Except I do, because I've been watching the movie with you ever since you got here.     
 I don't want to die.     
 So don't.     
 You don't have to.     
 Choose me.     
 The next step is right in front of you.     
 You just have to take it and be part of my family.     
 You want to feel connection.     
 It's human.     
 But in the end, it just hurts you.     
 You got blamed for Rachel Wilson's death because you were poor and you were black.     
 That's where love got you.     
 Why does that not make you angry?     
 I'm offering you a new life.     
 One without pain.     
 One without suffering.     
 Power is what you've been missing.     
 Love without power is misery.     
 Clark.     
 Choose, Carter. Do it. Now.     
 You can curl up and die, or you can be at the top of the food chain.     
 You can cash in, or you can run the table.     
 You can be the victim, or you can be the perpetrator.     
 Either way... your heart is going to stop beating in eight seconds.     
 So, what's it gonna be?     
 Jonas.     
 Jonas!     
 Lock it down! Everybody out now!     
 Jonas.     
 Your mask.     
 - What? 
- Whose blood is that?
