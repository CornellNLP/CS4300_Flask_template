 Previously on The Passage...   
 - WOLGAST: What now? 
- We go back.   
 Get Amy and get you guys out of here.   
 LACEY: Amy is my calling.   
 My job is to protect that child and all the promise she holds out to the world.   
 Martinez. Washington has approved your security proposal.   
 Cages now require two keys used simultaneously on separate panels.    
 Does Fanning ever talk to you in his dreams?    
 GREY: The last thing he told me was    
 "We have work to do."    
 LEAR: Carter gave me the message.    
 Said we'd already changed the world.    
 - What did you mean by that? 
- FANNING: You'll see.    
 - I don't want to die. 
- So don't.    
 FANNING: The next step is right in front of you,    
 - you just have to take it. 
- [ROARS]    
 CARTER: What Fanning wants is for you to believe the worst about yourself.    
 Don't buy it.    
 AMY: I don't want to be alone.    
 CARTER: You don't have to be.    
 You can go anywhere you want.    
 Mama?    
 Ain't nothing so bad we can't fix it.    
 What is this for?    
 - Light your way. 
- [DOOR OPENS]    
 FANNING: Hello, Amy.    
 FANNING: So, we're really gonna stick with the silent treatment, huh?    
 How'd you do all this, Amy?    
 This is incredible detail.    
 You got the homey feel, you got this creak in the floor and the coup de grâce is that scent of bacon just wafting through the air.    
 I've never seen anything like that.    
 What do you want?    
 I want to know how a little kid like you did all this.    
 That's easy. I had help.    
 Oh, from Carter. Right?    
 Yeah, he's a good guy.    
 He definitely has a soft spot for you, doesn't he?    
 Carter says I'm special.    
 That I'm different.    
 That's because you are.    
 He also said you would try to hurt me.    
 That is not true.    
 I'll tell you something that is true.    
 I wasn't nice to Carter when he was turning.    
 - Why? 
- Because when you become what I am and Carter is, it takes moxie, and I had to make sure that he could tap into that power, that he was ready.    
 Ready for what?    
 For what's coming next.    
 The end is near, my dear.    
 I don't do riddles, dude. 
Just say what you mean.    
 [LAUGHS]    
 All right, fair enough.    
 Amy Bellafonte,    
 I think that you are truly amazing, and, if you'd let me, I'd like to be your friend.    
 WOMAN: Lungs are clear.    
 WOMAN  : Heart rate's slow and steady.    
 What's happening?    
 The girl is sick.    
 Well, that's too bad.    
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]    
 Hey, Clark Richards.    
 We're coming to the end here.    
 And the only way you make it out alive is with me.    
 SYKES: You had no right to authorize this move without consulting me.    
 Well, that's some magical thinking. I'm the director of this project. I hired you, remember?    
 Why are you doing this?    
 No one is more disappointed than I am.    
 We all thought she was proof of the concept.    
 But it turns out she's no different from the others,    
 - so she goes to  B. 
- She's a little girl. It's not right.    
 Listen to me. After Elizabeth died, I went back to the lab.    
 And I realized that-that we could treat this like HIV.    
 We could alter the cells that the virus targets.    
 - I could be close... 
- "You could be close"?    
 "You could be close"? Do you even hear yourself?    
 If I were you, I'd be sick of gambling with people's lives.    
 I have fought for every single one of my patients.    
 What about your coworkers?    
 Simmons, Paulson, Pet. And poor Elizabeth Lear.    
 It's over for you, Nichole.    
 Amy's not the answer.    
 I'm rebooting Project Noah.    
 I'll be making an announcement shortly.    
 I'll talk to the director of the DoD and see about wrangling you a position as the head of security here.    
 - You'll report only to me. 
- That'd be great, sir.    
 I appreciate your taking an interest in my career.    
 Teachable moment here, Martinez, from a management perspective: know the limitations of your staff.     
 To be fair, sir, it did look like we were close.     
 The girl had all of the features and none of the bugs.     
 Well, they don't give you six points for getting the ball just to the two yard line.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 GUILDER: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for gathering together here on such short notice.     
 I'll be brief.     
 Your work here has been nothing short of heroic.     
 I want you to know that your government sees you.     
 That I see you.     
 But we've come to an end for most of you.     
 As of today, you're all relieved of duty.     
 You can go back to your lives and your families.     
 [LOUD MURMURING]     
 I've authorized bonuses for everyone as a thank-you for your service.     
 And I know how last days go, so you have my blessing to party, but let's keep that to off-shift hours, okay?     
 Thanks for your service, fellas.     
 What the hell's going on, Guilder?     
 I'm trying to save this sinking ship.     
 You're making a terrible mistake.     
 Look, Project Noah has ceased to function competently.     
 Now, you can blame it on whatever you want: battle fatigue... I don't care.     
 But I'm not gonna squander what potential this program has left.     
 These things are planning something, Guilder.     
 This is the wrong time to cut everybody loose.     
 Thank you for your service.     
 Now go pack your bags.     
 SYKES: I have to get back in the lab and figure out how to make this anti-viral work.     
 And we need to get Amy out of here.     
 [BEEPING]     
 [BEEPING CONTINUES]     
 How do we override?     
 Guilder.     
 How long do we have until Amy turns?     
 FANNING: A Wrinkle in Time, huh?     
 That's a great book.     
 It's phenomenal worldbuilding.     
 Can I see it?     
 Don't.     
 I am not here to hurt you.     
 I am here just to get to know you.     
 I don't want to know you.     
 - I want the agent. 
- I know.     
 He's a good friend to you.     
 But he's not here.     
 You know, me and my friends, we're like family.     
 And we talk and we, we share things, and lately, all the talk has been about you.     
 I'm never joining your family.     
 [CHUCKLES] I hear you, but thing is, things are changing.     
 I know you can feel it, right?     
 Hmm. And when they change all the way, you're gonna need someone who understands.     
 Can you just get out of my house?     
 We're coming to the end, my friend.     
 Things are gonna start to get scary.     
 And if you decide that you need me, you just give a holler, and I'll come running.     
 I promise.     
 [GASPS]     
 [PANTING]     
 Oh, my God.     
 Anthony.     
 I was wondering when you were going to grace me with your presence.     
 Did you get lonely?     
 You feel like playing for the team now?     
 Stay away from the kid.     
 Are you seriously trying to intimidate me?     
 I see what you're doing to her, and she's better off dead.     
 She's not your   th.     
 Says my reluctant   th.     
 You're a monster.     
 No. I'm just deeply sad and annoyed.     
 I did not recruit her through some schoolyard fence, I did not put her in this position and I did not give her the shot.     
 But she is turning.     
 And I can help her just like I helped you.     
 You only help yourself.     
 I hate what you made me,     
 - and I will never be like you. 
- Then don't be like me.     
 Be like you.     
 Be like The Fonz for all I care.     
 But if that girl doesn't turn, then none of us get out of these cages.     
 We need   .     
 Amy will turn.     
 And she will feed, and you will feed again.     
 And that is the universe as I've ordered it.     
 So you, you wipe your nose...     
 ...and you leave me to grieve.     
 Richards, what the hell are you doing here?     
 [GUN CLICKS]     
 Not dead. Sorry.     
 What are you trying to accomplish?     
 Amy's sick, you idiot.     
 GUILDER: I miss the old days, when we hung people for treason.     
 Just get us in the elevator.     
 [BEEPING]     
 Unlock this.     
 [CHIMES]     
 Good?     
 Let's go. Come on.     
 Hey. When you get down to the cellblocks, make sure all the virals are where they're supposed to be.     
 Okay. Why?     
 Just do it.     
 And not just on the monitors, all right?     
 Get eyes on all of them.     
 SYKES: How did she get out?     
 RICHARDS: I don't know. Let's just bring her back in.     
 SYKES: Any signs of her?     
 Affirmative. I got eyes on her.     
 Should I send backup,     
 - just in case? 
- [SIGHS]     
 Let's not make this more of a scene than it is.     
 - Okay, but, Clark... 
- I know.     
 I've got this.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Hang on a sec.     
 No, you can't make me go back there.     
 All right, Shauna, let's just talk.     
 I hate this place!     
 I keep having these nightmares!     
 It's the same guy every time, and it's so real.     
 We'll get you back to Dr. Sykes.     
 She'll get you a prescription.     
 There are no meds that can fix what is happening to me.     
 I just want to get you back safe.     
 [SIGHS]     
 [SIGHS] There's a   -foot razor-wire fence surrounding the entire property, you know.     
 Snipers with M   rifles could pick you off at any moment.     
 Then there's the pressure pad sensors, infrared cameras, not to mention the GPS chip in your neck.     
 There's no way out.     
 [CRYING]     
 [EXHALES]     
 [PANTING]     
 Please don't make me go back there.     
 [CRYING]     
 [SNIFFLES]     
 [PANTING]     
 Look, why don't we just go grab a bite to eat?     
 What?     
 Grey shouldn't have clearance.     
 Banks, do me a favor.     
 Can you check on Lawrence Grey in holding?     
 Guns down! Don't be stupid!     
 Do what he says!     
 - WOLGAST: Get that door open. 
- All right.     
 Get it open now!     
 - Where do you want these guys? 
- Conference room.     
 We'll be in the lab.     
 Let's go. Follow.     
 Go now.     
 You, too.     
 I have to take a second look at these DNA sequences.     
 These are Amy's vitals.     
 Yeah, she's stable for now, but there's no telling for how long. As soon as I finish,     
 I'll show you how to make up an anti-viral infusion for her.     
 Sure.     
 WOLGAST: Amy.     
 Sweetheart.     
 Can you hear me?     
 Hi.     
 How did you get in here?     
 I told you, kiddo...     
 I got skills.     
 I found you.     
 How you feeling?     
 My head hurts.     
 Okay.     
 First, let's get you out of these restraints and get you to the lab.     
 No.     
 No? What do you mean, no?     
 It's too dangerous.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 WOMAN: Thanks for picking me up.     
 Where you headed?     
 Telluride.     
 What about you?     
 Same.     
 [CHUCKLES] Look at that.     
 Must be some divine intervention happening.

 Grey!

 What I was told to do.     
 By Fanning?     
 It's his show now.     
 It's all his show now.     
 - What's his plan? 
- His plan is to change the world.     
 We-we each had a job to do.     
 What-what was it Babcock asked you to do?     
 ♪     
 It's insane that we're here.     
 Being the boss has its perks.     
 WAITER: What can I get you?     
 - I will be getting chicken fajitas and a burger. 
- Okay.     
 Don't judge.     
 And a beer.     
 WAITER: And for you?     
 Uh... stack of pancakes with, uh, bacon and a coffee.     
 - Coming right up. 
- Breakfast for dinner.     
 You're an enigma, Clark Richards.     
 Oh, yeah?     
 How's that?     
 I mean, look at you.     
 Got this coiffed hair, the posture, the gun.     
 What senator made you?     
 My dad's a judge, actually.     
 So, yeah.     
 Third Circuit, Court of Appeals.     
 I have no idea what that means.     
 It's a big deal.     
 Federal.     
 And you're the perfect son, right?     
 Always follows the rules.     
 Joined up. Works for the Man.     
 [EXHALES]     
 I'm the, uh...     
 the black sheep, actually.     
 My sister is, uh... is high up in the Justice Department.     
 My younger brother's a brain surgeon.     
 And I...     
 Work at Project Noah, babysitting me.     
 Hey, tell me something real.     
 Something you never say out loud.     
 Nothing mundane or basic, okay?     
 Tell me who you are.     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 [SIGHS HEAVILY]     
 I have a degree in creative writing.     
 - Mm. 
- Fiction, mostly.     
 A little poetry.     
 Oh.     
 Haikus?     
 - Sonnets? 
- Stop. Oh, stop.     
 - Is it free verse? 
- [CHUCKLES]     
 I thought this was a safe space.     
 Limericks.     
 And then I joined the Marines.     
 And now I do this.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 There's a piece of that story missing, but I'm gonna let it go.     
 I'd read your poems.     
 Oh, yeah?     
 Yeah.     
 If you wanted me to.     
 The virus is just too smart.     
 It embeds itself in a target cell,     
 and it replicates too fast.     
 You can't slow it down?     
 No. No, this is us trying something else.     
 If every virus has a key and every target cell in our body has a lock...     
 You want to change the locks.     
 I know it's crazy, but if you alter the target cell, then you've essentially locked the virus out.     
 But that won't reverse Amy's symptoms.     
 No. No, the abilities and the immunity will remain.     
 But if we can stop the virus before it hits the limbic brain, she won't turn.     
 It's a long shot.     
 [BEEPING]     
 It's our only shot.     
 You came back.     
 What's happening to me?     
 I don't feel right.     
 You're turning, Amy.     
 Pretty soon, you'll be just like me.     
 Though I have a hunch you'll have Shauna Babcock's luck and get to keep your pretty face.     
 What about the feelings?     
 I feel everyone in Project Noah.     
 I'm feeling the agent right now.     
 He's scared.     
 That part doesn't go away, I'm afraid.     
 We're cursed to feel too much.     
 But they don't all have to be bad feelings, Amy.     
 There's... good stuff, too.     
 Good stuff like what?     
 [GROANS]     
 RICHARDS: Why the hell does Lawrence Grey have unilateral security access?     
 I don't know what you're talking about.     
 I'd never authorize that.     
 Well, he destroyed our communications hub, so someone authorized it.     
 We're on an island out here.     
 Thanks for that.     
 Richards, I would never give Lawrence Grey a security clearance.     
 He gave Elizabeth Lear the virus, for crying out loud.     
 He should be in a cell somewhere!     
 While you were revoking my clearance, he got out.     
 Give me the codes.     
 I need to override the security system.     
 I-I can't.     
 Oh!     
 I'm gonna need a better answer than that.     
 The DoD, they-they sent out a new security advisor.     
 He reset all the protocols at my request.     
 What's his name?     
 Martinez.     
 Where is he?     
 He's upstairs. He's waiting for his ride back to D.C.     
 Ah.     
 Uh, ow, ow. Y-You're hurting me, you're hurting me.     
 I need your retinas, Grey. Or would you rather     
 I just popped those eyeballs out and leave you here instead?     
 Oh, we should go.     
 [MOANING QUIETLY]     
 WOLGAST: Hey. You're awake.     
 - Hey. 
- [WHIMPERING]     
 - You gotta let me untie you. 
- No.     
 Amy, I'm not afraid of you.     
 I know you would never hurt me.     
 - But I don't feel good. 
- Okay. Okay.     
 Let me call Dr. Sykes, but you're gonna be fine.     
 She's so close to solving this thing.     
 Can you hold on for me?     
 What's wrong? What is it?     
 Are you gonna throw up?     
 [AMY GASPS]     
 What does that mean?     
 Nothing.     
 You're gonna be fine. 
You're gonna be fine.     
 - Shh, shh, shh. 
- [CRYING]     
 Shh.     
 AMY: What are we doing?     
 FANNING: I'm showing you what's possible.     
 'Cause all those things that you love, and all those things that make you happy... they're still here.     
 Being a viral doesn't have to be scary or evil.     
 It can also be magical.     
 Winston hurt people.     
 Uh-huh.     
 I don't want to hurt people.     
 I don't want to hurt the agent.     
 Oh, you don't have to.     
 We all get one, Amy.     
 We all get to have somebody else.     
 And keep them with us forever. He could be yours.     
 Carter says I shouldn't believe anything you say.     
 And yet you still came to see me.     
 Why do you think that is?     
 What do you say we enjoy this beautiful day instead, huh?     
 Hey, look at that.     
 It's just like my old one.     
 Yes, it is.     
 Is this a trick?     
 It's a bike, Amy.     
 Come on.     
 Even I couldn't ruin a bike.     
 What do you say?     
 Want to give this puppy a ride?     
 [ECHOES]: Come on.     
 Saddle up, kid.     
 What's the blood for?     
 When we finish the anti-viral, we'll test it on her blood.     
 Hope it does what we need it to.     
 Sykes. She's burning up.     
 - Is there anything we can do? 
- She's getting what she needs from the IV for the moment, but the anti-viral is the only thing that can save her.     
 [EXHALES]     
 Hey.     
 Gotta keep the faith.     
 She just has to hold on a little bit longer.     
 There's something else.     
 She lost a tooth.     
 Okay. She's in the turn.     
 There's nothing we can do but keep moving forward.     
 But you never considered bailing?     
 Well, it's not like I've packed my bags.     
 All your black shirts and boots?     
 But a couple of times, yeah.     
 I've thought about it.     
 So then why didn't you?     
 Duty.     
 You never quit until the mission's complete.     
 Yeah, but you said how rough it is, how it eats away at your humanity.     
 That might have been the excitement of my second coffee.     
 [LAUGHS] Come on, man.     
 You almost admitted to a feeling. Don't walk it back.     
 I know.     
 
 
 
 - I'm super endearing. 
- [LAUGHS]     
 I'm not gonna lie. You are.     
 I knew you were a good guy.     
 Basically.     
 But now I can see a little bit of the poet underneath the...     
 [LAUGHS]     
 ...military thing, which is your armor.     
 Like you're always ready for an attack.     
 The judge was a drunk.     
 He'd laugh, make you feel like you're... his best friend in the world... and then... smack.     
 I know that syndrome.     
 Hey.     
 We've been talking about me this whole time.     
 What's your story?     
 Imagine if we got out of here right now and then we never looked back.     
 Shauna.     
 You make enough mistakes, every idea you have seems stupid.     
 But you just never know, right?     
 I mean, why bother otherwise?     
 She's here.     
 MAN: Copy that, two-five. Transport as soon as possible.     
 I didn't have a choice.     
 You always have a choice, Clark.     
 Always.

 You were in charge of logistics when Guilder got here, right?     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Did you know a Martinez, the security wonk you've been working with?     
 I met some of his uniforms, and a couple of body men, but no suits.     
 RICHARDS: These were the guys he had with him, right?     
 - Yeah. 
- Just uniforms?     
 Yeah, why?     
 [SIGHS] I'm try...     
 What'd I tell you about the eyeballs?     
 [SIGHS] I'm trying to find this guy.     
 Nobody's laid eyes on him.     
 Well, maybe he's CIA.     
 Sometimes you don't notice those guys, even when they're right in front of you.     
 They're like ghosts.

 You're coming with me.     
 This guy look familiar? Huh?     
 Your security advisor is a serial rapist and a murderer.     
 And viral number two.     
 Do you have any idea what you've done?     
 WOLGAST: You just gonna leave him there?     
 RICHARDS: It's what he deserves.     
 Let him think about what he's done.     
 WOLGAST: So what do we do know?     
 [SIGHS] These virals have designed the security protocols.     
 They took the communications down.     
 We can thank Grey for that.     
 These things are trying to get out.     
 Okay. So how do we stop them?     
 Well, killing them's not an option right now.     
 I got an idea.     
 And that won't go into Amy's cell, right?     
 That's right.     
 [SIGHS]     
 All right.     
 I'm gonna head upstairs.     
 Non-essentials need to evacuate.     
 I'll round up some people I can trust.     
 That's Grey's badge.     
 Just in case.     
 [WOLGAST EXHALES]     
 Do you ever think about that night at the diner?     
 Of course I do.     
 You already know that.     
 - Shauna, what's going on? 
- Didn't it feel like     
 - the beginning of something? 
- Don't do this.     
 You want a bloodbath?     
 That's not who you are.     
 Who I am is who you made me.     
 You put me in a cage and I want out.     
 That's not happening.     
 None of you are getting out.     
 Sure we are.     
 Because people like Grey and Guilder and you help us.     
 I'm not helping you.     
 You stayed my execution.     
 You killed Paulson.     
 You lied to Nichole about the dreams.     
 Clark, you have helped me.     
 Now, I'm saying this for the last time.     
 If you want safe passage, you need me.     
 You're right.     
 I do care.     
 But I don't care about you.     
 I care about the Vegas girl with the crappy life, the one who couldn't get a win no matter how hard she tried.     
 I care about the girl from that diner.     
 But you are not that girl anymore.     
 You are a monster.     
 And if I get the chance,     
 I will kill you.

 If the anti-viral works,     
 Amy's cells will block Fanning's virus.     
 We'll have done it.     
 If not...     
 No, don't even say it.

 Yes! Yes!     
 Oh. Okay, so, um,     
 now we-we-we prepare.

- Right.     
 - And then we duplicate it.

 We get it to the CDC. I mean, this is...     
 Oh, my God, this is amazing.

 Oh, God.

 Um, just a few minutes.

I need to cool her down.     
 Yeah, down the hall. There's a supply closet to the right.

 Of course you can. It's an order. Do it!     
 No, you'll-you'll-you'll be free soon enough, sir.

What are you doing to me?     
 I'm sorry to invade your personal space, but I, um... I need that.     
 Okay. Thank you. Thank you.     
 Doesn't matter. They're all asleep anyway.     
 Not for long, sir.     
 Please, son, don't do this!     
 The thing is, I... I don't have a choice.     
 And neither did you. No, no.

 Grey!     
 You'll kill us all!     
 What is this?     
 FANNING: This is something extraordinary and beautiful that only a few of us in the whole universe have ever seen before.     
 I don't feel good. I'm tired.     
 I know you're tired.     
 You're gonna feel better soon.     
 Everything we've gone through has led up to this moment in time.     
 What do I have to do?     
 You have to go through, Amy.     
 You can come out the other side, and you're reborn as one of us, or you can die in that tunnel.     
 [LOW GROWLING]     
 She's fading. Where are you?     
 Grey locked me in the lab.     
 - What? 
- Richards is working on it.     
 What about Amy? What happens if she...?     
 At a certain point, this is out of our hands.     
 With Carter and Elizabeth Lear, it-it became clear that they had a choice to make.     
 What do you mean? What kind of choice?     
 To join Fanning and become a viral or...     
 WOLGAST: Or what?     
 Or die.     
 I know this is terribly difficult, but I think...     
 I think we both know that she doesn't want to be with Fanning.     
 Okay.     
 Hey.     
 I know we made a promise to each other.     
 You don't leave me, I don't leave you.     
 But if you come to a fork in the road...     
 ...you can break your promise to me.     
 If you have to...     
 ...you can let go.     
 I love you, kid, no matter what.

 You are important.     
 You're wicked smart and strong and fast and funny and tough.     
 You can do anything you want with your life.
