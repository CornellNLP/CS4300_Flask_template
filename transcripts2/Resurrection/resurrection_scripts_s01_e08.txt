 Previously on Resurrection... 
 Gary. 
 Stop! 
 (Gunshot, gun drops on floor) 
 Stay with me. Hold on, Rachael. 
 (Sobbing) No. 
 This is Jenny, her mom and dad. They're like me. 
 Is she here? 
 (Voice breaking) Mom? 
 These people coming back-- they're just turning the world upside down. 
 (Maggie) Agent Bellamy, you there? 
 Oh, my God. 
 What is it? 
 Rachael. 
 (Insects chirping) 
 (Animal howling in distance) 
 How is this possible? 
 (Exhales) 
 I... still feel the same. 
 I think the baby's all right. 
 (Cell phone buzzes) 
 (Buzz) 
 Hello? 
 Any idea how many we're dealing with? 
 I'm getting dozens of calls at the station. 
 I saw five or six myself. 
 And that was a colleague of mine at the church. 
 More returned are gathering there. 
 How many? 
 I don't know. 
 It sounded like a couple dozen. 
 I have to go. 
 I'll go, too. 
 Are you tired? 
 Janine's still at her sister's. You can nap at my house. 
 I don't want to be alone. 
 Between the calls you're getting and the ones at the church... 
 We could be talking a hundred. 
 More if they keep coming. 
 ♪ 
 (Breath quavers) 
 You're so young. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Chuckles) 
 You're so... pretty. 
 (Laughs) 
 How... How long have you been here? 
 (Breathes unevenly) 
 I came back about a week ago. 
 I woke up a few towns over, and then I just came here. 
 But I-I want you to know that... I went to see you a few days ago. 
 I waited outside your house. I watched you. 
 (Inhales sharply) 
 (Voice breaking) 
 Why didn't you come up to me? 
 (Sniffles) Why didn't you talk to me? 
 Maggie, I... (Sniffles) I... I knew that if I approached you, I'd have to see Fred, and I couldn't do that. 
 I just-- I couldn't. 
 Why? 
 Why? Because of that man? Because of Sam Catlin? 
 Maggie-- 
 Who is he to you? 
 (Sniffles) Who, some fling? 
 I was just a baby. 
 You had just had me. What kind of mother does that? 
 What kind of... person does that? 
 (Sniffles and gasps) 
 It's not that simple. 
 Why? 
 Why not? Why? Why? What the hell is so complicated? 
 You had a family! You had responsibilities. 
 You don't know me! 
 You don't know how cruel Fred could be. 
 Stop saying "Fred." 
 You are talking about my father. 
 I know. 
 But you weren't there. 
 You don't... know how dark he could get. 
 No, you're so wrong. 
 You have no idea how much he loves you. 
 Maggie... 
 Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. 
 (Sniffles) 
 You need to talk to him. 
 You need to tell him that you're back, and that... you're with Sam. 
 Tell him... or I will. 
 (Sobs) 
 (Door opens) 
 (Door closes) 
 (Man) We'd seen bad rains before, but... nothing like that. 
 (Dog barking in distance) 
 (Woman) My mama said she once saw the waters rise full up above the saw mill doors. 
 Maybe. Anyhow, we knew we had to get out quick. 
 Those flats next to Pine Creek flood fast. 
 That's where they used to house the saw mill workers. 
 Actually, I was a carpenter at the factory. 
 Your grandfather housed some of us there, too. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Even as that cold water rushed over us, I held on tight. 
 (Voice breaking) 
 But I wasn't strong enough. 
 The last thing I saw before I went under was my babies in the water. 
 Babies? 
 You see, that's the other reason we were out there in the woods. 
 (Sniffles) 
 We were looking for Robert, our baby boy. 
 He didn't come back with us. 
 Well, maybe he came back somewhere else. 
 My brother's the Sheriff. 
 I'll notify him, and he'll keep a lookout. 
 Tell him Robert has a birthmark on the back of his neck. 
 It looks like a crescent. 
 I'll tell him. 
 We appreciate all your help. 
 Okay, Sheriff. No, I just got to the church. 
 Yeah, I'll keep you updated. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 (Tom) All right. All right. If-- if you could each fill in one of these sign-in sheets with your name, it'll help us try to find your families. Okay? 
 And we've also called the grill to get you some food. 
 I know you've all had a long journey, to say the least. 
 Agent Bellamy, uh... they just keep showing up. 
 I mean, they're all starving. They need somewhere to stay. 
 Most of them don't have family or friends in Arcadia anymore. 
 That's why they're all coming to the church. 
 Great. (Sighs) 
 I knew this was coming. 
 Helen, I didn't invite this. 
 These people need help-- 
 (Laughing) 
 Eva? 
 (Gasps) 
 (Gasps) Oh! 
 You... 
 (Laughing) 
 (Both crying) 
 (Indistinct conversations continue) 
 (Line ringing) 
 (Toni) - Hello? 
 Toni. 
 Anybody ever tell you you shouldn't call your boss at 2:00 AM? 
 There are hundreds of them now. 
 What? 
 The returned. They've been coming back all night. 
 There's no keeping a lid on this anymore. 
 These people need help. 
 Food, shelter, sanitary-- 
 Marty, I... 
 That's not even in our purview. 
 This is way beyond-- 
 I know. 
 But you can make some calls. 
 We gotta get out ahead of this thing. 
 We need humanitarian aid, but no guns. 
 This can go one of two ways, Toni. 
 Let's make sure it goes the right way. 
 (Insects chirping) 
 Fred? 
 (Whispers) Barbara. 
 (Holster thuds) 
 (Gasping) Oh, my God. 
 (Sobs quietly) 
 You came... 
 (Gasping) 
 (Breath quavering) 
 Fred... 
 Just... 
 Just let me look at you. 
 You're exactly as I remembered you. 
 You're so beautiful. 
 I... 
 This isn't what you think. 
 I know. 
 I know about Sam. 
 And it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 I know that I made mistakes, and I know that he was there when you needed him, and I'm so sorry. 
 No, it doesn't matter anymore. 
 I know that you were unhappy. 
 It's-- it's too late for that. 
 But we have another chance. I love you. 
 No, don't-- 
 Please, I-- 
 You're not hearing me. You're not listening. 
 Barbara... 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 I've made up my mind. 
 It's over, Fred. 
 When I came back, it was clearer than ever. 
 I've been staying with Sam for the past week, ever since I got back. 
 I went straight to him. 
 Maggie found me. 
 I know that I should have come to see you as-- as soon as I got back... 
 (Voice breaks) 
 and I am sorry for that. 
 I'm sorry, Fred... for not being stronger. 
 Okay. 
 It was a long time ago. 
 You made your choice. 
 I have to accept it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Footsteps departing) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Fred gasps softly) 
 (Speaking inaudibly) 
 (Clicks remote) 
 (Alcohol swishes) 
 (Click) 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Excuse me. 
 Dr. Langston. 
 Hi. 
 Did you get my messages? 
 I've been trying to reach you all night. 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know. I was exhausted and I fell asleep early. This is unbelievable. 
 How many are there? 
 We've counted over 75. 
 With the calls coming in to the Sheriff's Station and the ones still showing up, I'm guessing there's going to be a lot more by the end of the day. 
 Well, where are they coming from? 
 Good question. 
 That proximity theory of yours is not exactly holding up. 
 People are returning from as far back as the early 1900s, and most popped up in neighboring counties and states. 
 Well, it wouldn't be the first time that I overthought something. 
 Where will they all stay? 
 I contacted my boss at ICE. 
 She's making some calls to some other agencies at DHS. 
 Hopefully we'll get some support soon. 
 You asked the federal government for help? 
 I didn't feel like I had much of a choice. 
 We're trying to help people find relatives. 
 And we're keeping a paper list of names. 
 Don't need this getting out online. 
 Hmm. Well... looks like you could use some help. 
 I've been wanting to hear their stories since I got here. 
 Thank you. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Hi. I'm Eric Dr. Ward from the National Institute of Health. 
 Thank you so much for helping out. 
 (Rattling and rumbling in distance) 
 What the heck is that? 
 (Vehicles approaching) 
 (Brakes squeal) 
 (Men speaking indistinctly) 
 (Man) Let's go! 
 (Continues indistinctly) 
 Which one of you is Agent J Martin Bellamy? 
 I am. 
 Toni Willis sent me. 
 (Man) All right, open 'em up! 
 (Men shouting indistinctly) 
 I understand there's some people around here who could use some help. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Dad. 
 Hey. 
 I saw her. 
 It was good. 
 We had a good conversation. 
 Finally got some closure on some things. 
 I told her I respect her decision. 
 Dad... 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Colonel Stone? 
 Thank you, Sergeant. 
 Excuse me. Fred Langston, Arcadia County Sheriff. 
 Agent Bellamy wanted us to coordinate our efforts. 
 That's right. He did. Good to meet you. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 You got yourself a beautiful town here. 
 Reminds me of a different era. 
 (Chuckles) Simpler one. 
 We do our best to keep it simple. 
 Colonel Stone, what exactly have you been told about the situation here? 
 Not much. There was a storm, some flooding. 
 Left a bunch of folks without power. 
 I'm afraid Agent Bellamy has left out a few details. 
 Really? Like what? 
 You see that woman over there? 
 Red dress, pretty, brown hair? 
 Uh-huh. 
 I want to show you something. 
 They don't die, Colonel. 
 And they're dangerous. 
 One's already committed a murder and attempted another. 
 And the worst part is, people think these are their loved ones returned. 
 But they're not. 
 They're deceiving us. 
 What do you propose we do? 
 I propose that we protect the living instead of the dead. 
 (Rings) 
 (Sighs) 
 (Beeps) 
 (Piano playing "Chopsticks") 
 Hello? 
 (Female recorded voice) Hello. 
 This is the Arcadia County Sheriff's Department with an important message. 
 If you've had a loved one return to you, please bring him or her to the Thornton High School gym between noon and 4:00 PM. 
 There, your loved one will receive a temporary ID, a flu shot, and an information packet about what they can expect moving forward. 
 Thank you. (Beeps) ♪ (Cell phone vibrating) (Indistinct conversations) Sheriff. What is this I'm hearing about a robo-call sending people to the gym? It's standard protocol. The gym's designated as the official center for disaster relief. Why didn't I know about this? You asked me to coordinate relief efforts with Colonel Stone. I didn't realize you needed every detail. Next time, keep me in the loop. Will do. (Man) ...coming out, load up on the buses. Hey. I heard we're moving to the high school gym. Yeah. I just heard myself. Mind if I ride with you? Sure. (Bellamy) You wanted to talk? Yeah. I guess I did. My mother's back. The thing is, she's been back for a week. She came to see you? No. No, because... she's staying with that man. I'm sorry. Well, I told her that she had to face my dad. How'd he take that? How did he say he took it, or how did he really take it? There's this empty part of me. It's always been there. I filled it with schoolwork and ambition, but... deep down, I knew... (Voice breaking) it could never be filled, because... (Sobs) she was gone. And now, impossibly, she's back. And I only feel more empty. (Man) Keep it coming. Keep it coming. Through here. (Car doors close) You know, you can put that right there. Yeah. Then instead of a possum, it'll be a cat. What's a possum? It's delicious. Mama, look what Jacob made for me. (Jenny giggles) Oh, what a fierce creature. (Lucille) Jacob? What's wrong, buddy? All those people... they're like me. Right? Yes. I don't think people are gonna like that. Hey. Now, you listen to me. This has been a hard week, Jacob, to say the least. But I'm gonna make you two promises right now that I will never, ever break. One... we will always be together. And two-- I will always keep you safe. Okay? All right, come on. Let's go, buddy. 
 
 (Man, amplified voice) All returnees, please join the line so we can check you in. (Indistinct conversations) I need your attention, please. All questions will be answered once you're inside the building. Don't stop to talk. Just keep moving. You coming? I'll meet you inside. I'm gonna go talk to the Langstons. (Man) All your questions will be answered inside. Mr. and Mrs. Langston. Marty! Hey, buddy. Listen, uh, you guys don't need to be here. We already have all of Jacob's information. We can make him an ID some other time. So you don't have to wait on line here. Are you sure? Well, the message from Fred's office told us to-- - Absolutely. I'll handle it. You guys go home and enjoy the day. But what about Jenny? We came with a-- with a family who returned. The Thompsons, that African-American couple over there. They stayed with us last night. How about I'll bring 'em back to your house after they're done here? All right, if-- if you say so. Come on, Jacob. We'll meet them back at the house. Tell Jenny not to forget her possum. I will. (Indistinct conversations) (Man) Next in line, please step up. (Camera shutter clicks) (Plastic rustling) Mr. and Mrs. Thompson? I'm Agent Bellamy. A friend of the Langstons? (Exhaling) Can I talk to you outside for a moment? (Indistinct conversations) Excuse me. Agent Bellamy. Are they returned? Yeah. If you wouldn't mind, we'd like all returned to stay inside for now. There's an announcement coming up soon. Oh, okay. We're just headed out to get some fresh air. We'll be right back. Nah, there really isn't time. The announcement is just about to start. I get it, deputy. We'll just be a minute. I'm sorry, Agent Bellamy, but I got my orders. Orders? No returned can leave the gym. No exceptions. If you got a problem with it, you'll have to talk to Sheriff Langston. Okay, so what are you saying? This is a trap. The deputies have been ordered to keep all the returned in this gym. Ordered? Whose orders? My father's? Why would he do that? (Speaking inaudibly) You know why. Look, I ignored my gut once before and I lost someone because of it. Not this time. Okay. I'm calling him. You think that's a good idea? (Cell phone beeps) That's weird. No reception. I got nothing, either. What's going on? Tom, you got a cell? Yeah. Have a signal? No, I don't. Could mean they cut our phones off. Who? We got to get these people out of here. I'll get Rachael. Excuse me. If you're right... What? The list. All of the information about the returned is in here. My mother's name's on that list. Stay here and find it. Okay. Marty-- I'm going to the Langstons'. The phones are out. This could be serious. Be careful. (Camera shutter clicks) How many are in there now? By rough head count, I'd say north of 250, but the line's trickling outside. Might not be many more. Okay, good. Colonel Stone should be here soon with reinforcements. (School bell ringing) What the hell is that? (Man shouting indistinctly) (Woman) Follow me! Come on! Come on, come on! (Bell continues ringing) (Man) Come on, come on, go, go, go! No, no, no, no, no! Come with me! (Indistinct shouting and screaming) Come on! Hey! Hey, it's okay! Come on! Hey! There's no fire! It's okay. There's no fire! Hey! There's no fire! Just-- It's okay! Go back inside! There's no fire! Close the damn doors! There's no damn fire! (Ringing continues) How do you know there isn't a fire, sir? Because he's letting them go free! Can't you see?! They're escaping! Go! Get them! Escaping? You said we were keeping them inside to-- to protect them? Just never mind that! Just go round them up now! Just go do it! I'm not going anywhere! My kid sister's in there. What did you just say to me? Are you disobeying an order? You're damn right I am. Then give me your badge now! Fine by me. You're fired! (Badge clatters on ground) (Ringing continues) We're gonna need more men. What is it? Well, looks like Carl. Parked in our driveway for some reason. Well, maybe Fred sent him over for extra protection. Hmm. Yeah. (Clears throat) (Curtain rings swoosh) All right, great. That should be, uh, that should be everything. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Eric? Yeah? Do we have all their names? Yeah. I think that was the last one-- of the ones that are still left inside, I mean. Okay. We need to destroy that list. If my father gets it, he'll be able to identify all these people. Without it, they have a chance to pass. Maggie... (Huffs) if we lose track of the returned, then it will become nearly impossible to continue to study them. I know. And I know what that can mean for your disease. But, Eric, you've talked to these people. You've heard their stories. Do you really think they deserve to be treated like lab rats? Rip it up. (Lock clicks) Get out. Why? We're rounding them up. What if they don't want to come? You said it yourself. They're not human. Come on. Let's go. (Fred on radio) Carl? You there? I'm outside Henry's house. They're still inside. Okay, good. Whatever you do, don't let them leave. I'll head over soon. Hand me the radio. Keys. (Sighs) Get in the back. (Keys jangle) (Locks doors) (Handles rattling) (Pounds on door) Jacob's in danger. What? (Door closes) It's Fred. He locked up a bunch of the returned in the gym. That's why I wanted you guys not to go in there. Wait a minute. What's going on? What are you talking about? Barbara's returned. She didn't go back to Fred. Oh, no. I don't know what he's planning on doing, but you guys need to leave now. Well, where would we go? Anywhere. You just need to go! No, no, no. I'm not a young guy. What if we have to run? What if we get stopped? You at least have to try. Take Jacob and get out of here. I don't think this is a good idea, Marty. We don't know what's out there or what they're gonna do. You have to try. No. You  have to go. What? They'll be looking for us. But you are the government. They won't stop you. (Whimpers) Yeah, she's right. You have to take him. And you have to protect him for as long as it takes. (Jacob) Dad? What's going on? Come on down here, Jacob. Come here, buddy. (Clicks tongue) Hey, listen. You're gonna have to go away with Agent Bellamy. What? Go where? Whoa-- Hold on, you're just gonna leave town for a little while... No, dad-- But we can't go with you. Daddy, no! No! No, no-- No, let go of me! Jacob. Jacob. Dad, Jenny needs me! Jacob, listen-- You promised me! You promised! No, listen to me, damn it! (Sobbing) (Sobbing) Okay. (Crying) You're right. I have to break my promise to you. I have to break my first promise to keep my second. (Sobs) You have to go with Marty. (Continues crying) That's the only way that we can keep you safe. Okay? You understand? Okay. (Sobs) Hey... (Kisses) that's my boy, huh? There you are. Mommy... Oh, Jacob... I'm sorry. (Crying and sniffling) (Inhales and exhales deeply) We're gonna see each other again very soon. (Whimpers) Where'd you park? On the side. Okay, good. We'll go out the back so Carl won't see that you've left. Take the old fire road from the factory. Remember how to get there, Jacob? Yeah. It leads out of town. Nobody will think to look for you there. Agent Bellamy. Do what you have to do. Come on. (Gate creaks) Come on! Come on. Hop in the back. And stay down. (Door open signal chimes) (Starts engine) (Tires screech) (Brakes squeal, engine turns off) Get him out of there. (Car door closes) Wait there. (Front door closes) (Police radio chatter) (Exhales) You understand? I promised Colonel Stone that we'd round them all up. How would it look if I made an exception for you? Look, it's not like they plan to harm them. They're just gonna take them... to a camp or something. I'm sure you'll be able to visit him. Henry... I'm sorry to tell you this, but it's not Jacob. I know you think it is, but it isn't. And it's better that you know that now than later. Someday you'll thank me for this. (Loud slap) (Grunts) (Exhales) Everything the old man said about you was right. Thank you. Search the house. Go on! (Radio squawks) (Gonzalez) Sheriff? Yeah, Gonzalez, what is it? I think you better head back to the gym. Why? What's going on? (Radio squawks) Gonzalez? (Radio squawks) Deputy, what's going on? (Radio static) (Men shouting indistinctly) (Speaking indistinctly) (Vehicle door closes) (Indistinct conversations) (Man) Stay here. We're not letting anybody leave. (Indistinct conversations) (Man) Ma'am, I need you to sit down. (Indistinct conversations) (Speaking indistinctly) (Stone) We estimate 60 to 80 have escaped. Aside from what they're wearing, it's impossible to tell them from the regular folk. We'll get 'em. Colonel Stone, you made a mistake. Those are my men tied up over there. That's all right. We'll sort it out later. I'm sorry. Later? When are you taking the returned away? We're not. We're keeping them here. They're under quarantine. The whole town's quarantine. - No, no, no. Wait a second. I never agreed to that. You said you were taking them to a camp-- Plans change, Sheriff. We're discussing a perimeter. Right. So we will notify the neighboring communities... (Continues indistinctly) (Maggie) My files are privileged! You have no right. You have no right! (Man) Are you saying that you don't respect the authority of the United States government? Uh, Dr. Langston didn't mean to suggest that she's not gonna comply with-- Yes, I am. As a matter of fact, that is exactly what I'm saying. I do not have to give anything over to you, or any other government entity here. You can't make me do that! Okay. Dr. Langston, I'm gonna ask you to put your hands behind your back. What?! (Laughs) Yeah. Maggie? What's going on? Uh, ma'am, this is none of your concern. Hey, that-- that's my daughter. (Sighs) Hey! Hey, hey! Stand down. Maggie! Stop it. Stand down. Hey! Hey! You take your hands off her! I'll fix this. Haven't you done enough? Wh-what if they want to hurt us, mama? Pastor Tom says they're friendly folks. (Jenny panting) (Rings doorbell) (Tom exhales) Tom. Hi, Kimberly. These people need help. Come in. _ Can I sit up now? Yeah. Yeah, you can. We're in the clear. Hey, you know what I could use right now? A milkshake. With chocolate chip ice cream. Ah... doesn't that sound good? No. Mint chip. Mint. Okay. I think I can get into that. (Jacob) What's that? (Brakes squeal) (Seatbelt clicks) Stay in the car. (Opens door) (Crunch) How many are there? I thought I told you to stay in the car. (Wings fluttering) (Helicopter wings whirring) (Gasps) (Vehicles approaching)
