 Previously on "Resurrection"... 
 Are you hurt?  
 Ow! 
 [Grunts] 
 Oh, my God. 
 There are some of us, we want to get out of here. 
 Maggie : You could give birth any day now. 
 Do you have a place to stay? 
 The room upstairs has been empty for months. 
 It's yours. 
 Henry! 
 My brother is dead. 
 You can bring Henry back? 
 Yes, I can. 
 I need to go where he is. 
 I need you to shoot me. 
 No way. Neither one of us... 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Insects chirping] 
 [Birds cawing] 
 [Bell tolling] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Dogs barking in distance] 
 Marty? 
 Jenny? 
 Marty? 
 [Gasping] 
 What do you mean, they're not responding? 
 You'll see. 
 What do we do? 
 ♪ 
 [Siren wails] 
 Maggie.  
 Dad. 
 What's going on? 
 Jenny? 
 [Gasping] 
 Jenny. 
 Henry. 
 Henry. 
 [Gasping] 
 Marty. 
 Jacob?  
 Dad. 
 They're all returned. 
 Yeah, but what in the hell are they doing here? 
 [Gunshot] 
 [All gasp] 
 Dad. 
 Yeah. Are you okay, buddy? 
 Henry? You okay? 
 Woman : How did I get here?  
 Hey. 
 Marty, I'm scared.  
 It's okay. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Was it a dream? 
 I don't know. What happened? 
 I don't know. You were all staring at that window. 
 Rachael's in there. 
 [Country music playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Preacher James? 
 What is it, Jacob? 
 How we all got here, do you know what it was? 
 I don't like the way it made me feel. 
 Well, I understand, yeah. 
 I'm gonna try to get some answers for myself. 
 Do you think my grandma felt it where she is? 
 And where exactly might that be? 
 The government has her. 
 They took her away after she made my Aunt Barbara disappear. 
 She made her disappear? 
 Was your Aunt Barbara one of the returned? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, monkey. Your ma's on the way. 
 Jacob : Okay. All right, I'll leave you to it, then. 
 Preacher. 
 My God. What happened? 
 How? don't be alarmed. 
 I'm sure everything's gonna be okay. 
 No, I mean, one minute I'm having breakfast, Henry, I promise you, I'm gonna talk to you, but I have to talk to Agent Bellamy. 
 Well, typically I tell a mother to relax and monitor contractions until closer to active labor, but... 
 But this is not a typical pregnancy. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Yeah, you're right. Exactly. 
 Bellamy : Preacher. 
 James : I'm sorry to interrupt. Um... 
 Uh, give us a few minutes. 
 Fred : Marty, it's okay.  Why don't you come in. 
 Maggie : Yeah, don't worry. 
 Rachael, this is Preacher James. 
 He seems to know a lot about the returned. Rachael is also returned. 
 But she wasn't affected by the trance this morning. 
 So, uh, what exactly happened? If you don't mind me asking. 
 Yeah, it's fine. 
 Fred : Sure. 
 Well, I was sleeping, and I woke up with a contraction. 
 Then I saw everybody standing outside that window. 
 That must have been disconcerting. 
 Yeah. 
 Has this ever happened before? 
 No. 
 Could you sense that we were out there before you woke up? 
 No, uh... 
 I don't know. 
 [Train whistle blows in distance] 
 Rachael, if you don't want to answer any more questions, it's okay. 
 Yes, ma'am. You've had a bizarre morning. 
 I wouldn't want some stranger barging in here and asking a bunch of questions, either, so... 
 But could I ask you just one more? 
 Did you return with that child? 
 Yes. 
 [Grunts] 
 Maggie : Another contraction? 
 Mm-hmm.  
 I'll leave you now. 
 Rachael, you seem like a fine young woman. 
 And, uh, stay strong. You're in good hands. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 We should go. 
 I'm gonna take you to the clinic, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [Country music playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 You see that flower in there? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Same as the one we saw in the field. 
 This trance? 
 What do you make of all of it? 
 Hmm. 
 Just that we're all connected. 
 And much more than I realized. 
 And that all of us... 
 Have some role to play. It's not just you and me anymore. 
 We need to figure out what Rachael's role is. 
 [Indistinct whispering] 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Groans] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Screams] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Screams] [Gasps] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Panting] 
 It's gonna be difficult. 
 It's gonna be difficult, Lord. 
 But I will not fail you. I will not fail you. 
 I will not fail you. 
 [Indistinct whispering] 
 [ Sighs heavily ] 
 No.  
 Do you have any kings? 
 Lucille : I'm so glad he has a friend. 
 Do you have any queens?  
 Go fish. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Do you have any 2s? 
 [Sighs] 
 What? 
 I can't believe I almost lost you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You'd never lose me. 
 [Sighs] 
 Preacher James! 
 [Chuckles] 
 Would either of you, uh, have a nickel? 
 'Cause I'm flat out. 
 No.  
 No. 
 Oh. 
 Well, what... what in the... 
 Then what is this behind your ear, hmm? 
 [Laughs] 
 -Oh!  
 Jacob : Hey! 
 Hi. Preacher, nice to see you. 
 Hey. Just thought I'd come by and see how everybody was doing. 
 Well, come on in. 
 Yeah. 
 I won't be long. 
 Can I get you something? Water? whiskey? 
 Ooh. 
 [Sighs] 
 Uh, water would be lovely. 
 Okay. Come on in, Preacher. Sit down. 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, part of the reason I wanted to come over was to continue the conversation you began earlier. 
 [Clock tolling] 
 How you feeling, Henry? 
 Well... 
 You know, it was, uh... It was unsettling to suddenly find yourself someplace else like that. 
 I don't like the feeling of not being in control. 
 Well, returned or not, control is something that eludes all of us in this life, so... 
 There she is. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 I hope I'm not overstepping, but, uh... 
 I can't help but to be curious about what Jacob said about your mother making his aunt just disappear. 
 I mean, is that even possible, for someone to make a returned person disappear? 
 Apparently so. 
 But why? 
 I mean, she'd have to have a reason of some kind. 
 In her deranged logic, she probably thought she was protecting Fred. 
 She cloaked all of her terrible behavior under the guise of protecting her family. 
 Well, I know how hard it can be to turn the other cheek. 
 I really do. 
 But... 
 A son should never be estranged from his mother. 
 Now, perhaps I can put together a meeting with the two of you. 
 I did know your mother when she was a child... 
 But you don't know the woman that she's become. 
 Look, Preacher, I appreciate everything you've done. I really do. 
 But I am finished with her. 
 I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 It's obviously still an open wound. 
 No. That's my fault. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I shouldn't have pried, but... 
 It's an old habit of being a preacher. 
 Thank you for your hospitality. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Margaret? 
 Hello, Robin. 
 This morning was kind of scary, right? 
 I believe more for them than us. 
 I heard they're doing tests on us now. 
 Where did you hear that? 
 Beth. 
 Remember when she was taken out of here this morning? 
 She came back, and she said that they took her blood and then they hooked her up to some machine. 
 [Voice breaking] And she said it hurt. 
 I got this... 
 This... fear of needles. 
 I don't like them. 
 I mean, I know it's stupid, but I just... can't do it. 
 Robin, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. 
 [Sniffles] 
 They wouldn't hurt us. 
 Robin. 
 Robin Campbell! 
 Come with me, please. 
 What for? 
 It's boss's orders. 
 You didn't answer my question. 
 Miss Langston, you will let me do my job. 
 It's not me you have to worry about, Randy. 
 It's all of them. 
 [All murmuring] 
 They're human beings. They have rights. 
 That's not what this is about. 
 It's not? 
 Am I the only one who'd like to know  why  we are being taken away? 
 [All murmuring] 
 Now, I suggest you leave Robin alone... 
 And you go tell your superior to come and explain to us what these tests are for. 
 We would like to know. 
 Woman : We have a right to know! 
 [All murmuring] 
 Is that clear? 
 Woman : We won't be taken away. 
 What's going on? 
 [Cheers and applause] Yeah! 
 [Chuckling] Yeah. 
 Yeah! That's great! 
 [All cheering] 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Door opens] 
 I asked the sheriff where I might find you. 
 Hope I'm not interrupting. 
 No, I was just, uh, thinking. 
 Yeah. I've been thinking a lot, too, about this morning. 
 May I?  
 Yeah. 
 Jacob said something earlier that I found troubling about Margaret Anderson... Or, uh, Langston, I mean. 
 Many people find her troubling. 
 Because she can make the returned disappear. 
 How does that connect to Rachael? 
 Seems like we're all connected to Rachael somehow. 
 And if Margaret Langston knows something we don't about that phenomenon, then I'd like to talk to her. 
 I've done that. You won't get anywhere. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Now, Marty, both your parents were at that government facility, weren't they? 
 Can you imagine how frightened they would have been by the events of this morning? 
 What are you getting at, Preacher? 
 Just a small service from one of their own might be helpful. 
 I want them to know that they're not forgotten. 
 These people are scared, Marty. 
 And if we don't help them, who will? 
 I'll reach out to my contact there. 
 You're a good man. 
 Hmm. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Hey.  
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, you know, just... 
 Getting rid of some old clutter. 
 Hmm. 
 What's going on? 
 Well, I just, uh... I stopped by to return this. 
 No, you didn't. 
 You've had that drill for two years. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You're checking up on me. 
 Can you blame me? 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Okay. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Answer me a question, though. 
 What? 
 You afraid of me? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 Mrs. Langston. 
 It's a pleasure. 
 Pleasure is mine. 
 Won't you sit? 
 No, thank you. 
 [Door closes] 
 What are you trying to accomplish by stirring up a revolt? 
 I have no interest in stirring up a revolt. 
 But these tests, the taking of blood, the way you are treating us is wrong. 
 I want to leave. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Well, I'm afraid that's not possible. 
 After the events of this morning, this facility is on lockdown. 
 That's a mistake. 
 You can't keep us here against our will. We have rights. 
 Your behavior this morning was unpredictable. 
 You people have no idea what you're capable of. You may be a danger to yourselves. 
 Randy. 
 Please escort Mrs. Langston back to her room. 
 The men and women here are restless. 
 We won't stand for this kind of treatment. 
 We'll see. 
 [Door closes] 
 
 
 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Been trying to call you. 
 Well, it's been a busy day. 
 You need to come to the facility immediately. 
 Something happened this morning,  an incident. 
 This incident... It involve the returned? 
 Some kind of trance? 
 It happened in Arcadia, too. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I'm still trying to understand it, find some answers. 
 At this moment, I don't need answers. 
 I need someone to calm them down. 
 The returned here are... agitated, and Margaret Langston is fanning the flames. 
 What am I supposed to do? Group meditation? 
 You know, I don't care what you do. 
 But if something isn't done quickly, we're going to have to sedate them. 
 And if that doesn't work, we'll have to put them in solitary. 
 No, no. Wait. 
 Look, I don't know if I can help, but I think I know someone who can. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Birds cawing] 
 Picking berries? 
 Oh, pulling weeds. 
 These berries are poisonous. 
 You were right. 
 The returned in the government's care, they're distressed. 
 Your help would be appreciated. 
 Well... 
 If you ask me, they never should have been locked up in the first place. 
 I guess that's a battle for another day. 
 [Sniffs] 
 I'm gonna need some time to get cleaned up and gather my things. 
 Come back in an hour? 
 Sure. 
 Yeah. 
 Lord, thank you for showing me the way. 
 I ask you for the strength to see it through. 
 [Car door closes] 
 This is him? 
 Preacher James Goodman, Angela Forrester. 
 Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you. 
 Is it Miss or Mrs. Forrester? 
 Agent Bellamy seems to think you can offer our guests here some comfort and reassurance. 
 God willing. 
 Was he searched? 
 I got crackers, wine for communion. 
 Those are my weapons. 
 Take him through to the common room. 
 What exactly happened this morning? 
 One minute, we were all asleep in our beds. 
 The next minute, we were standing in front of Twain's. 
 Twain's? 
 It's a bar in Arcadia. 
 Serve cocktails and food. 
 Nothing to write home about. 
 I'm glad to see that you're taking this so seriously. 
 I wasn't in control of my own body this morning. Yes, I'm taking it very seriously. 
 I thought maybe... maybe it was some form of mass hypnosis, but controlled by whom? 
 By what? 
 [Sighs] 
 Any ideas, Agent Bellamy? 
 No. 
 Did you have something to tell me? 
 I've made progress with my calculations. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Preacher James. 
 Well, little Margaret Anderson. 
 I'm surprised you recognize me. 
 I must have been 10 the last time you saw me. 
 Well, the eyes never grow old. 
 Never lose their sparkle. 
 My son Frederick seems convinced you're responsible for bringing Henry back to us. 
 I must admit... 
 I remain skeptical. 
 If I recall, your miracles were nothing more than cheap stage tricks. 
 Well, now, I've heard.... that you learned a few tricks of your own. 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, perhaps I misunderstood Jacob. 
 But he was telling me something about his Aunt... 
 Barbara, I believe it was. 
 It was Fred's wife. 
 This conversation's finished. 
 I need to know what you did and how you did it. 
 Now, you show me, I'll help you. 
 I don't recall asking for your help. 
 Well, you want out of here, don't you? 
 If you allow me, I'll make it happen. 
 Why would I agree to do your bidding? 
 Because I know what you value more than anything else. 
 And if you don't help me, your whole family... 
 Matter of fact, your entire legacy will all die. 
 After the events of this morning, I ran some new numbers based on data we've collected since opening this facility. 
 You're seriously trying to predict how many more will return? 
 Why not use a crystal ball and tarot cards? 
 Predictive analysis works. 
 Having the returned here has allowed us to build a more comprehensive picture of who they are, when they died, and the circumstances involved. 
 And there are patterns... Clear, undeniable patterns. 
 You're mining them for data like test subjects. 
 I prefer statistical anomalies. 
 What's your point? 
 It's been known for decades that this phenomena has occurred before. 
 But only in Arcadia. 
 James : The communion was instituted on the same night that our Lord Jesus was betrayed. 
 He sat down at a table for what would be the last supper. 
 Jesus took bread. He broke it. 
 And he handed it to his disciples, and he said, "take this... and eat. 
 This is my body." 
 He took the cup, and he filled it with wine, and he said, "drink this, all of you. 
 This is my blood." 
 So what I'd like to do now is just take a minute to invite you up and participate in this outward expression... 
 Of your inward faith. 
 [Indistinct murmuring] 
 The government had a file. 
 Many didn't believe it. 
 They thought these were just ghost stories. 
 When returned have appeared in the past, there typically have just been a handful occurring a few times a century at most. 
 Mass returns are rare. 
 You're saying there have been other mass returns? 
 I believe so... centuries ago. 
 Native-American tribes in the area have told stories of such events. 
 But this return in Arcadia is probably the largest of all. 
 What makes it happen? 
 It's like trying to predict an earthquake. 
 Scientists can know that an earthquake on a particular fault line is coming, but not when. 
 You're saying there's another mass return on the way? 
 Yes. A big one. 
 I just don't know what will trigger it. 
 Mass returns in the past have typically been accompanied by a trigger, a new returned whose sudden appearance seems to set off the mass returned. 
 A new returned? 
 Yes. 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 What is that?  
 I don't know. 
 You need to see this. 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh, God. 
 [Gasps] 
 Poison. 
 You brought him here. 
 I trusted you! 
 I had nothing to do with this. 
 He poisoned them all. 
 Why? 
 Why would he do that? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Sheriff Langston. 
 I'm at the government facility. 
 All the returned are dead. 
 What? 
 The preacher. He was here. He poisoned them all. 
 What... that's impossible. They can't die. They'll... 
 Exactly. He broke them out. 
 Listen, you got to get over to Maggie's clinic and get Rachael away from there. 
 Now. 
 Wait. Just hold on. Slow down. 
 Just what's going on? 
 It's the preacher. 
 He's gonna be coming for her. Why would he do that? Last time I spoke to him, he brought up your mom, talked about how she disappeared Barbara. What? You think he's trying to do the same thing to Rachael? I don't know what his motives are yet. But, yeah, I think so. Where do you think they'll pop up? I don't know, and I don't know when. And, Fred, your mother's with him. Are you sure we should leave? Where are we going? Not far, not in your condition. Not another hospital, please. I can't go back to the hospital. [Sighs] You won't have to. I'm gonna deliver this baby myself. Okay, car's out front. We need to get moving. Okay, will somebody tell me what's actually going on? Look, we think that you might be in danger. We think that one or two of the returned, they might want to try to hurt you and the baby. But I'm not gonna let that happen, you hear me? It's all right. We're gonna take care of you, both of you, okay? Come on. It's gonna be all right. Okay. Why don't you grab her suitcase? Thank you. Where's Marty?  Not sure. Said he was on his way back. Okay. Then he'll be here. I got it. [Horn honks] Mom?! [Door opens, closes] Go in the house, kids. In the house. [Car doors close] Maggie : She started having contractions in the car. Your house was close. It's okay. I've got the bedroom already made. Thank you.  Hi. Henry : How far along is she? Fred : Oh, it's hard to tell. Jenny : Jacob, are you coming? I've got deputies patrolling the neighborhood. Bellamy's the only one that knows she's here. Shouldn't be a problem. You think that preacher really means to harm her? Marty seems to think so. But why? I mean, he was here in my house this morning, for God sakes.  Well, to be honest, I don't know what he intends, but I'm not gonna let him hurt Rachael or that baby. She's already been through too much. Some of it at the hands of my own deputy. Hey. [Sighs] You should know. They all got out, including ma. She won't come around here. [Wings flapping] [Birds cawing] Man : What's going on? Man #2 : What happened? Woman : We've returned again. Man #3 : What did we take there? Man #4 : We've come back. [Indistinct conversations] Do you where you're going? I'm just following you. Woman #2 : Where are we headed? I promised I'd get you out. Now I want you to tell me how to make the returned disappear. Why would I? Because we're all in danger. Rachael Braidwood's child is a dark soul. What? It was all foretold, Margaret. [Scoffs] Revelation 13... "I beheld a beast come up from out of the ground." Now, that child has gestated in death. It's never known life on this Earth. It has many names... The beast, the antichrist. Make no mistake, that child must not be born. You're insane. Hey, Margaret. You think the returned are meant to be here? You think we're angels... Or demons? We're no worse than they are. Yeah? And what about when we all come under the control of this creature? That's your son, your grandson, you, thousands of others that are inevitably going to return. And you really want to live in a world with no free will? Where so many of us will be forced to do the beast's bidding? I won't do  your  bidding or anybody else's. I thought we had a deal. I... Woman : Where are we going? It's okay. [Sighs] She'll be back. Woman #2 : Where is he taking us? [Sighs] [Beeping] Dear God. There will be millions. [Gasps] [Knock on door] Hey.  Hey. Any news? Not yet. I'm just stopping by to check in. Then I'm gonna look for the preacher. Marty.  Henry. The house is secure. Jenny : Marty. Do you know there's a woman having a baby upstairs? Yeah, I'm actually about to go check on her right now. Can I come? Let me check on her first. Then we'll see. Okay. Hey. Come here. [Chuckles] What was that for? 'Cause I love you. [Chuckles] [Knock on door] How is everything. Good. We're settling in. You? Fine. Nothing to worry about. You're a bad liar. You're gonna be okay. No one knows you're here. Well, that didn't stop everyone from showing up at my window this morning. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, Rachael. Jenny : Do you want to play another game of cards? Yeah. I'll be right back.  Okay. [Door closes] [Groans] Margaret : Jacob! Grandma! [Gasps] Are you coming in? No. You know I can't. I just wanted to see you. Why is there a police car here? Um... What? It's Rachael. She's... she's inside. Rachael? The pregnant woman? Well, what's wrong? [Groans] It's the baby. I can feel it. And... What? I-it's hurting me. Lucille : Jacob! I have to go. I have to go. No. No. don't.  I have to. Jacob!  Jacob, no. Told you not to go out of the house. It's gonna get dark. Sorry. [Gasps] Oh, that one was stronger. It was closer together, too. That's a good thing. Everything is progressing as it should. It's never gonna end, is it? Oh, I know it seems that way now, but just keep breathing. No, I don't mean the labor. Ever since I returned, someone has been after me, and I didn't do anything to anyone. No, you didn't. [Sighs] [Voice breaking] I just wish Tom was here. What kind of world is it that my son will have to grow up and never know his father? It's the one we live in. I don't want to go any farther till we say a quick prayer, so, Father, we thank you for being a God that we can talk to... You got some nerve coming back here. Robert. You used me. You lied to me. What happened to us being connected? In the end, I know you'll understand the reason for it all. Well, I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else. You're coming with me. [All murmuring] I'm afraid I can't. I got other plans. To kill again? I never killed anybody. I set all these people free. [All murmuring] How close is she? Well, she'd be a lot closer if she were able to relax. Does she need company? No, you know, at this moment, I think it just might make her more tense. Hmm. And how about you, hon? You okay? I'm nervous. I've never actually delivered a baby before. Well, you're a Doctor, and I may not be much of a midwife, but I have been on the other end of it. Thank you. These people followed me here for a reason, Robert. I know you all think that this man is some kind of prophet. Man : That's right. But ask yourself, should you trust a man who uses trickery and lies to achieve his goals? What does he really want? Does he want to save you or does he want to control you? Control? That unborn child controlled all of us. So ask yourself, Robert, is that child a good thing? Is that a child of God? Or something else? Woman : Evil. I have a mission, Robert. And I won't let you or anybody else stop me. What mission? To prevent the end of the world. I know where the mother is. We're gonna need your phone. Henry : Getting dark. [Sighs] Fred : Yep. [Cellphone vibrating] It's Marty. He's at the church. Preacher's still not there. Nothing from my deputies, either. You remember how dad used to come and sit out here every evening after work? Yeah, pour that first whiskey, pull up a chair, and watch the sun go down. I never understood at the time why he'd want to be out here all on his own. But I get it now. Peace and quiet. Mm. It's getting cold. How about a coffee break? Sounds good.
