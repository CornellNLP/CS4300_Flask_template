 Previously on "Resurrection"... 
 All the returned that had loved ones here in town, they let them stay. The rest of them they took. 
 Where? 
 Nobody knows. 
 That man. He wasn't dad. 
 I know, Ray. 
 Are you gonna invite me in? 
 All of our troubles started with that girl. 
 We're making my bad luck chili. 
 Oh, wait. That's before your time. 
 Maggie : Are you sure about this, dad? 
 We can be friends. And I think we both need one. 
 They were better off without you. 
 You just let go. 
 Rachael, can you hear me? 
 Oh, m-my baby. 
 People are getting sick. 
 There's nothing more I can do for you. 
 You knew about this already. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Sirens wail in distance] 
 Man : Over here! We've got a survivor! 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Ringing continues] 
 Agent Bellamy. 
 [Clears throat] 
 What can I do for you? 
 I'm sick. 
 [Coughs] 
 I need help. 
 You have the virus. 
 [Coughs] 
 I don't know. 
 I thought you could, uh... 
 Agent Bellamy? 
 I thought... 
 [Coughs] 
 Agent Bellamy. 
 ♪ 
 [knocking on door] 
 [Dog barks in distance] 
 Hey. You didn't sleep, did you? 
 [Sighs] 
 You talk to Marty? 
 Maggie : He's gone. 
 What? 
 He took all his stuff, left a note saying he was looking for answers. Haven't heard from him since. 
 I left him a message about my mom. 
 And he didn't call you? 
 Well, that doesn't sound like him. Are you sure he's okay? 
 No. 
 But I'm tired of asking. 
 I wish I understood. 
 Why do they come back just so we can lose them all over again? 
 Maggie... 
 What exactly did you see last night? 
 I told you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Margaret and your mom were talking, and then she was just... 
 Gone. 
 Did Margaret seem upset? 
 No. 
 But your mom was. 
 But... Margaret definitely saw her disappear. 
 Yes. 
 I mean... 
 I think. 
 It... it was dark, but... 
 Yeah. 
 You okay? 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Maggie. 
 Aunt Lucille. 
 Is my grandmother here? 
 Can I help you with something? 
 Maggie. 
 Are you sure? 
 Oh, Maggie. I'm so sorry for your loss. 
 Thank you. 
 Why is this happening? 
 How can they just disappear like that? 
 [Door opens] 
 Margaret : Be careful with that, Jacob. We want to be able to fly it again. 
 Honey, go wash your hands. There's oatmeal in the kitchen. 
 Ma... 
 Margaret : What is it? 
 It's my mom. 
 Last night, you were in the park with her when... 
 Last night? 
 No, I was home all evening. 
 What's happened? 
 Weren't you with her when she... 
 Disappeared? 
 Disappeared? 
 What do you mean? 
 Elaine said she saw you. I... 
 The last time I saw Barbara was at Frederick's house yesterday morning. 
 She seemed perfectly fine. 
 Maybe she's just left town. 
 No. 
 No, as far as we know, she's not coming back. 
 Maggie... 
 Maybe Elaine was mistaken. 
 It was dark. 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm? 
 Yeah. 
 Um... 
 I... 
 I thought you were the last to see her. 
 I thought... 
 I was hoping you could tell me how she was. 
 Oh, I wish I could. 
 I'm sorry, Maggie. 
 Well, thank you. 
 I should get going. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door slams] 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 [Groans] 
 What is this? Where am I? 
 You're in a government facility, and you're receiving medical treatment. 
 This is just a sedative. 
 You were extremely distressed when you came in. 
 I don't want a sedative. I'm okay. 
 I have it, don't I... 
 The virus the returned have been getting. 
 Yes. You do. 
 What do you know about it? 
 It appears to be a mutated form of the Spanish flu, possibly with a precursor virus that was harbored in birds. 
 It's contagious, but only amongst the returned and only as long as symptoms present. 
 Well, that's good, right? 
 You know what it is, so you can make a vaccine. 
 Unfortunately, the virus is mutating too quickly for that. 
 So, what? There's nothing you can do? 
 We have a treatment. 
 It's experimental, and it's not a cure. 
 But it suppresses symptoms temporarily. 
 Is that safe? 
 We don't know. 
 Would you prefer the injection in your arm or your hip? 
 Whoa, whoa. Wait. 
 I want to talk to the woman, the one I report to. 
 I'm not taking anything until I see her. 
 I think that would be unwise. 
 Why? 
 Because your fever will escalate and you'll become delirious. 
 You'll bleed from your ears and your nose, and eventually your skin will take on a bluish tint due to a lack of oxygen in your blood. 
 And then you'll disappear. 
 Get her. Now. 
 Jacob : This is so cool. 
 Remember there was a table over there? 
 And remember how it used to smell in here? 
 Yeah. Smelled like paint. 
 And wood... 
 Wood if it was grass. 
 Sawdust. 
 Hey, dad. Look. 
 That's where your office was. 
 That's right. 
 You always kept jelly beans in your desk drawer, remember? 
 I remember. 
 It's gonna be your office one day. 
 Maybe. 
 Why? You don't want to work here now? 
 Do you really think I'll be here that long? 
 You know, we could have stayed home today, but I thought it was important that we come. You know why? 
 Nobody can predict the future. 
 But that doesn't mean that we should live as if we won't have one. 
 We have today, we have right now, and we hope for tomorrow. 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 Let's see who that is. 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 Hey. 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah. I'm Brian Addison. 
 Henry Langston. This is my boy, Jacob. 
 Jacob. 
 Well, you're not from around he. 
 No. No, but I've got a cousin who lives here. 
 And I know a great piece of property when I see one. 
 Well [Chuckles] it's not for sale. 
 No? Really? 
 That's too bad. 
 Very versatile, close to the river, not too far out of town. 
 Look, I... I know what it looks like. It's all rundown. 
 But I'm planning on getting it going again back to what it once was. 
 Really? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, that is a very ambitious goal. 
 Well, I'm an ambitious man. 
 Well, tell you what... if you're serious about this and you need an investor, just give me a call. 
 Hmm? Sure. Thanks. 
 It was nice meeting you both. 
 Nice meeting you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Jacob. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Beep] 
 Exactly what part of me saving your life do you object to, Agent Bellamy? 
 And let's not forget you're the one who called me. 
 I just want some answers. don't you think I'm at least entitled to that? 
 We think a returned brought back this virus from the early 1900s. 
 When the virus went through their metabolism, it mutated. 
 Now only other returned seem to be able to catch it. 
 As you know, it spread in Arcadia, but it was also brought here. 
 How many returned have died? Disappeared? 
 So far, we've lost 66. 
 The actual virus has a 23% mortality rate. 
 But if you reach the final stages of this illness, you will... you disappear. 
 I know. 
 You said we should just let them get infected, that this might be the natural course of a returned life cycle. 
 That's right. 
 Then why treat them? 
 Just because this may be normal doesn't mean we shouldn't collect all the data we can, including data on how they respond to treatments. 
 Did you invent the treatment? 
 No. 
 I'm not a scientist. 
 So, what do you do here? 
 I'm a statistician. 
 A statistician? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So you're gonna tell me this is an accounting firm? 
 Take the medication, Agent Bellamy. 
 [Sighs] 
 Is that a scar on your neck? 
 It's a birthmark. 
 Camille : [Crying] Can you help me find my baby boy? 
 He's only six months old. 
 He has a birthmark on his neck. 
 It's in the shape of a crescent. 
 I hadn't noticed it before. 
 It's... it's very distinctive. 
 You can have one of your own. 
 Just get a tattoo. 
 Oh, that's it? 
 We were just getting to know each other. 
 Get some rest, Agent Bellamy. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Ray! 
 Okay, listen, you can't just walk in here and start rearranging tables. 
 How many people do you have? 
 7. 8... 10 at the most. 
 All right. Fine. But you have to order. 
 We're gonna order. 
 Yeah. Soda and coffee doesn't count. 
 No, we'll order. 
 You gotta tip too. 
 Okay. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. Enjoy. 
 Hi, Elaine. Hi, Jacob. 
 We're here to eat lunch. 
 Margaret : Elaine. 
 You're Maggie's friend, right? 
 Lovely to meet you. 
 I'm Maggie's grandmother. 
 I know. 
 The poor dear is beside herself over what happened to her mother. 
 I don't know what you think you saw last night in the park, but I assure you... you are mistaken. 
 I wasn't there. 
 This is... a difficult time for Maggie. 
 She's going to need the support of her family and friends. 
 I always support Maggie. 
 Excuse me. I'll be right back to take your order. 
 On second thought, Jacob, I think I'd rather eat at home. 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Hey, Mag. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's mom. 
 She's gone. 
 You mean... like Caleb. 
 Elaine said she saw Margaret in the park with mom last night when she disappeared, but when I talked to Margaret this morning, she didn't know anything about it. 
 It doesn't make sense. 
 C-can I... get you some tea or something? 
 No, no, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 I have to get back to work. 
 I have patients today, and I... 
 Maggie, no. Maggie, take a breath. 
 Please. 
 Okay? Just sit. 
 It's just, like, I've got a lot to do today, you know? 
 I can't... 
 I know, honey. 
 I understand. 
 But right now, just.. what can I get you? 
 Tea is fine. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 Hey, Maggie. 
 I think a tablespoon. 
 Mm, okay. 
 We're making my bad luck chili. 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Uh, work just called. I have to get back. 
 Are you sure you're... you're okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, it's okay. 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 Thank you. 
 Keep it down. 
 What's the problem? 
 The bathroom door is stuck. 
 [Sighs] 
 Aah! 
 You're lucky it wasn't a gun. 
 [Beep] 
 [Beep] 
 [Beep] 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Sorry. 
 You're Ray's sister? 
 Guilty. 
 Oh. He, uh, never said you were such a foxy lady. 
 Um... thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You joining us for the true living meeting? 
 The what? 
 It's what we call ourselves... "The true living". 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Okay. 
 What are you doing? 
 It's a map of where the returned are living in Arcadia. If you'd ever bother to check out our website, you'd know. 
 Okay, Ray, seriously? 
 "Returneds abducted my cat." 
"Returned screwed up my wi-fi." 
"Returneds keyed my car." 
 This is ridiculous. No wonder people still believe the government-hoax story. 
 It's not ridiculous. We're just a group of concerned citizens... People who don't want to be victimized by the returned. 
 Okay, Ray. I know that you're hurt by what happened with dad... 
 No, I'm not. Not anymore. Because I'm doing something constructive. 
 The returned are just people. 
 I don't want you having these meetings here anymore. 
 
 
 
 [Door opens] 
 Do we have an update on Rachael Braidwood? 
 She's stable. She's still presenting with flu-like symptoms, running a slight fever, but she's holding her own. 
 Good. And the baby? 
 Oh, still normal heartbeat, vitals. Everything looks good. 
 Maggie : Good. Great. Thanks. 
 Dr. Langston, we've got eight patients out there waiting to be examined for signs of the virus. 
 Okay. 
 [Girl giggling] 
 Dr. Langston? 
 Hmm? 
 You look a little pale. 
 Just give me a few minutes, okay? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 [Drawer closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Humming] 
 Frederick. 
 What did you do? 
 I'm sorry? 
 I know you were with Barbara last night. 
 What did you do to her? 
 Frederick... 
 If this is about what Maggie's friend thinks she saw, she's mistaken. 
 You're lying. 
 Fred... you stop it! 
 You've been lying ever since you came back. 
 I've been looking out for you ever since I came back. 
 How dare you? 
 What difference does any of this make? 
 She shouldn't have come back in the first place. 
 What did you do to her? 
 Everyone's better off without her. 
 You shut your mouth. 
 She's the reason Jacob died, the reason this family fell apart, and if there's one thing I'm here to do, it's fix this family. 
 Were you always like this? 
 After everything I did for you... 
 You were a suicidal drunk when I came back. 
 What the hell did Barbara ever do for you? 
 She gave me Maggie. 
 [Door slams] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Martin : Angela. 
 When were you gonna tell me? 
 When were you gonna tell me I died in 1934? 
 [Footsteps approach] 
 Angela : Stop. 
 Please. Close the door. Wait outside. 
 [Door closes] 
 I only just pieced it all together this morning. 
 Pieced it together? 
 This is a game to you? 
 Everything I remember about myself, my life... 
 I was dead the whole time. 
 That's one way of looking at it. 
 How would you look at it? 
 From where I sit, you're one lucky son of a bitch. 
 You got a second chance. 
 And a third. 
 You cheated death. 
 You have no idea how this feels. 
 You're right. 
 I don't. 
 The first time... 
 1934... 
 I drowned? 
 That's right. 
 There was a flood. 
 In Arcadia? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You were six months old. 
 Then you came back in Chicago, 1972. 
 Child welfare must have assumed that you'd been abandoned, and they placed you for adoption. 
 Agent Bellamy, until today, you were something of a snag in my calculations. 
 I believed you were the only one who wasn't born in Arcadia. 
 I want to meet my birth parents. 
 You've already met them. 
 The thompsons. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Thompson? 
 I want to see them. 
 They're here in your custody, right? 
 They were here. 
 They were among the first to be infected with the virus. 
 I'm sorry, Agent Bellamy. 
 They disappeared three days ago. 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Thud] 
 [Clatter] 
 What about the little girl? 
 Jenny? 
 Your sister. 
 She's here, and she's healthy. 
 Am I contagious? 
 Not as long as your symptoms are suppressed. 
 As long as you stay on the antiviral medication, you're fine. 
 I want to see her. 
 I want to see her now. 
 Well, I-I did an Internet search on his name. He seems legitimate. 
 A lot of real-estate deals in the west... 
 California and Arizona. 
 Do we really want to do this with someone we don't know? 
 Margaret : Lucille's right. 
 This is a family business, and... 
 I've never heard of any Addisons in Arcadia. 
 Well, he said he has cousins here. 
 And besides, ma, not every family has been here since the dinosaurs. 
 Jacob, help me pick some flowers from the garden. 
 No, thanks, grandma. 
 It wasn't a question. 
 Go. 
 I thought you agreed that starting up the factory again would be good for us. 
 I do. 
 I mean, I know you want it to stay in the family. 
 We all do, but this is our future that I'm planning, Loo... yours and mine and Jacob's. 
 And if this Brian Addison... 
 If he can help us make that happen, I just don't want to miss that chance. 
 Well, I suppose it can't do any harm to hear what he has to say. 
 Could be a great opportunity. 
 If this is what you really want, you know I'm on your side. 
 Yeah. Good. 
 I remember you. 
 From before, when we could be outside back in Arcadia. 
 That's right. 
 How do you like it here? 
 [Sighs] 
 Mama and daddy wanted to leave before they... 
 You know... before they went away. 
 They were sick, Jenny. 
 The people here didn't want you to be sick, too. 
 Neither did your parents. 
 They're not coming back, are they? 
 I don't think so. 
 No. 
 That's what I told Debbie. 
 She didn't believe me. 
 She thinks her daddy's coming back, but... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 He's not, either. 
 Look, Jenny. 
 I know this place is not home, but you'll be safe here. 
 I don't want to stay here. 
 I know. 
 It's only for a little while. 
 I'm gonna look after you. 
 As soon as it's safe for you, I want to bring you back to Arcadia with me. 
 Would you like that? 
 That's you. 
 That's my whole family. 
 That's my mama, that's my daddy, and that's my baby brother. 
 Baby brother. 
 His name is Robert. 
 I call him Robbie. 
 It's for me? 
 Thank you. 
 You promise? 
 You'll come back? 
 I promise. 
 I promise... everything is gonna be okay. 
 Why do grownups lie? 
 They don't. 
 Well, not all the time, anyway. 
 Why do you ask? 
 Did somebody lie to you? 
 No. N-no. Just asking. 
 Well, sometimes telling a lie is kinder than the truth. 
 And sometimes grownups lie to protect another person's feelings. 
 Oh, so you mean like, um, telling someone you like their new haircut when really it makes them look stupid? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Exactly. 
 Now, that's just a sugar lie. 
 That's what my mom used to call them. 
 Okay. Upstairs. Brush your teeth. 
 I'll be up soon. 
 [Mid-tempo music plays] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Hey, sheriff. 
 Your mom came in today. 
 I get the feeling I'm not her favorite person. 
 She told me I didn't see her with Barbara, but... 
 I really thought that I did. 
 No. It's okay. don't worry. I believe you. 
 I'm sorry about Barbara. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, lately, I've been feeling like I live in this space between what's real and what's possible. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I know how you feel. 
 I thought I understood what it must have been like for you when your... dad disappeared. 
 Now I know. 
 I've been thinking, though. 
 Maybe Ray was right all along. 
 He never believed it. 
 When my dad came back, he never believed he was who he said he was. 
 I've been thinking maybe he was right. 
 I used to think that. 
 Used to? 
 Yeah. 
 The more time I spend with them, the more I realize they're exactly who they say they are. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'll have a coffee. 
 ♪ Oh, feet, don't you fail me now ♪ 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 [Beep] 
 Congratulations, Agent Bellamy. 
 Your observation period is over. 
 Terrific. You're gonna spring me? 
 Take these with you. 
 Remember that you need to inject yourself with one full ampul of medication every 12 hours. 
 As long as you do that, you should remain symptom free and you won't be contagious. 
 There's only 20 ampuls here. 
 That's just a 10-day supply. 
 That's right. 
 I'm gonna need more than that. 
 I don't have any more to give you. 
 All that airplane crap in your office... 
 What's that about? 
 Nothing. 
 It's just a hobby of mine. 
 Plane crashes are your hobby? 
 That's right. 
 And they hired you for that? 
 They hired me for my ability to predict things that many people think aren't subject to prediction. 
 Are you saying you can predict things about the returned? 
 When it will happen again, how many will come, how long before they'll disappear. 
 Everything in nature follows a pattern and is therefore subject to prediction. 
 How do you define nature? 
 Definitions change, but numbers are perfect. 
 Numbers don't lie. 
 [Laughs] 
 You really don't know anything, do you? 
 We will. 
 I'll be back to pick up Jenny as soon as I can. 
 I understand. 
 So, I'm just allowed to walk out the front door? 
 You know better than that. 
 Certain procedures need to be followed. 
 [Beep] 
 [Scoffs] 
 Come on. Is that really necessary? 
 Not anymore. 
 Is there something you want to ask me? 
 Well, go ahead. 
 Nothing's off limits between us. 
 What happened to Aunt Barbara? 
 It was time for her to go away. 
 Is... is it because of what happened when she came to dinner? 
 Was it my fault? 
 No, Jacob. 
 It was sweet of you to invite her. 
 It was her time, and she knew it. 
 She just needed someone to show her how. 
 Is that why you went to see her in the park? 
 I had to lie about it. 
 People who aren't like us wouldn't understand. 
 Am I gonna have to go away one day? 
 One day... 
 We both will. 
 It's nothing for you to worry about, Jacob. 
 When the time comes, I'll be here to help. 
 [Smooches] 
 Here's mom to tuck you in. 
 What were you and grandma talking about? 
 Nothing. 
 Hmm. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Ringing stops] 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Sighs] 
 I know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I went to the government. 
 I needed answers. 
 I'm sorry about your mom. 
 They sent me back with medication. 
 A vaccine? 
 No, it suppresses the symptoms and delays the progress of the virus. 
 Okay. At least it's something. 
 The thing is it's difficult to make and there's a limited supply. 
 How much did they give you? 
 Not enough. 
 Each dose lasts 12 hours. 
 I want you to have it, to be in charge of distributing it. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Oh. 
 I was about to give Brian Addison a call. 
 Have you noticed how much time Jacob is spending with Margaret? 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's amazing, isn't it? 
 I mean, it's just like they picked up right where they left off. 
 I always imagined that they'd have been close if things had been different. 
 Yeah. It's nice. 
 Sometimes I wonder about the ideas she puts in his head. 
 Well, you can't take her seriously. 
 That's just ma being ma. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, you should make the phone call before it gets too late. 
 Okay. 
 [Clears throat] That's great. Great. Look forward to it. 
 See you then. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 That was Henry Langston grandpa. 
 What did he say? 
 Wants to meet, talk about the factory. 
 What did I tell you? The first mention of money and those Langstons are like ants on a lollipop.
