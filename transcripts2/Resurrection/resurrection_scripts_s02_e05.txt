 Previously on "Resurrection"... 
 You have to turn people in? 
 To the government. 
 Sooner or later, you're gonna have to do something for them you don't want to. You do realize that, right? 
 It's me. I got something for you. I think I made some progress. 
 What's this trucking accident have to do with it? 
 One of the returns died in a fire. The stories don't add up. 
 All of our troubles started with that girl in there. 
 You killed him. You killed my son. 
 I want you to know that you're not alone.... in any of this. 
 It's my deputy's brother. 
 He died 15 years ago. 
 Help me. 
 Fred : What's going on? 
 They're all returned, and they're all sick. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 I never got it running. 
 Awful lot of effort just to get back to where you started. 
 Where's Maggie? 
 At the clinic. Worked all night. 
 She have any idea what we're dealing with? 
 She thinks it could be a new flu strain or some kind of viral pneumonia. 
 Only people who have come down with it so far are returned. 
 So, five, then? 
 Six, if you count Arthur Holmes. 
 I'll tell her you stopped by. 
 I'm not here to see her. 
 Found that under a building in my family's factory. 
 That fire back in '35, I figure it killed those 12 men. 
 My family tried to hide it by making up the truck accident. 
 Probably would've stayed hidden except, at some point, two of them returned. 
 And they were murdered... three times over. 
 These are people coming back from the dead. 
 They probably thought they were ghosts. 
 Who killed them? 
 I don't know. 
 Do you want to know? 
 This is an 80-year-old case, Agent Bellamy. 
 And whoever's responsible is long gone now. 
 Your mom was a kid back then. 
 Ask her? 
 I did. 
 And if she knows something, she's not inclined to share it with me. 
 And you're telling me this out of the kindness of your heart. 
 You had most of it anyway. 
 And I know guys like you. 
 You're not gonna let it go. 
 People were killed. 
 There just might be families out there who'd like to know the truth. 
 The truth... is a slippery thing these days, isn't it? 
 Maybe people want to know, maybe they don't. 
 One thing's for sure. 
 You dig this up, the only people that get hurt are the ones that you care about. 
 The langstons. 
 Maggie. 
 ♪ 
 [Mid-tempo music playing] 
 Mrs. Langston? 
 Barbara. [Chuckles] 
 Hi. 
 I'm Elaine Richards. I-I'm a friend of Maggie's. 
 Oh, hi. 
 I-I know a Richards. 
 Um... 
 Caleb, right? 
 Yeah, he was my dad. 
 I recognize you from all the pictures at Maggie's place. 
 That's nice. 
 Yeah. 
 I've never seen her place. 
 Oh. 
 Look, um... 
 Maggie's not always great with... feelings. 
 But having you back, I-it's what she's always dreamed of. 
 So, if it seems like she's being hard on you, it's just... 
 No. 
 Uh, it's not her fault. It's mine. 
 You know, after everything that I've done, I don't deserve anything more. 
 We all make mistakes. 
 But the ones who love us, they forgive us. 
 I-it's pretty dead around here. I-I can sit with you, if you like. 
 Just talk. 
 That'd be nice. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm just gonna go take care of one thing. 
 [Dialing, ringing] 
 Mr. Enders. 
 There's no sign of concussion from your car accident, and your fever has broken. 
 Well, hold on while I jump for joy. 
 What the hell is wrong with me? 
 Mikey, come on. She's trying to help. 
 We don't have a clear picture of what we're dealing with. 
 But I'm starting you on antivirals, which seems to be effective in combating the most severe symptoms. 
 For now, I'm sending you home with your brother. 
 Well, I need to see a real Doc... a man. 
 Well, the good news is, I can tell you're already starting to feel better. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 Uh... 
 Dr. Langston? 
 Um, the other one that came back, that Arthur guy... He was sick, too, wasn't he? 
 He was. 
 And didn't it make him, like, disappear? 
 Well, we're not sure if it was because of the virus, but, yeah, he did disappear. 
 That's why I need you to be vigilant. 
 Okay, deputy? 
 Yeah. 
 We're getting out of here, Carl. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Bunch of witch doctors. Gonna kill me, these people. 
 Where's my stuff at? 
 Thank you. 
 No problem. How's it going? 
 Okay, I guess. No new cases. 
 And we've been able to keep the symptoms under control. 
 That's a good thing, right? 
 I hope so. 
 Have you talked to your contacts in the government? 
 No. 
 I'm not bringing them in on this. 
 It was just a question. 
 We're better off without their help. 
 Phone message for you, Doctor. 
 Thank you. 
 [Mid-tempo music playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Um... hi. 
 Maggie! I'm so glad you're here! 
 I can see that. 
 Your friend Elaine is the best. 
 Sit down, sit down. 
 You need a drink. 
 No. I think maybe it's about time we call it a night. 
 One drink. It's girls' night! 
 Girls' night? 
 Not my idea. 
 She just needed someone to talk to. 
 How long has she been here? 
 Uh, a while. 
 She's lonely. 
 You know, I think back then, her and Sam, it was a fling. 
 But now she's living with an old man. 
 Oh, wow. My mother and her boyfriend aren't getting along? 
 How terrible. 
 She's a kid. 
 She's younger than us. Ease up on her. 
 She's also my mother. 
 Hey, and why are you getting involved in this? 
 I'm just trying to help. 
 I know. I know. 
 I'm just saying... 
 Give her a chance. 
 Barbara : Shots! 
 Uh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Yes. They taste like cotton candy. 
 [Groans] 
 That sounds awful. 
 It  is  awful. 
 Do it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 She would forge excuses for the whole school. 
 One time, she got the entire football team to go see "Phantom Menace." 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I have excellent penmanship. 
 You must've been very popular in high school. 
 Oh, no no. Uh, Elaine was the one with all the friends. 
 I was the girl in the science lab. 
 Oh, God. 
 No. I have to go. 
 I have to open early tomorrow. 
 I-I got to leave, guys. 
 Just one more drink. 
 Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. 
 Maggie, your mom is a horrible influence. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 This has been fun. 
 See ya. 
 Uh... yeah. I should probably get home, too. 
 I wish I'd known you when you were younger. 
 It must've been hard for you to grow up without a mother. 
 Dad did okay. 
 Yeah, I know he has his faults, but he was a good father. 
 He learned to french braid my hair. 
 He's changed. 
 I can see that now. 
 I feel like I've lived 30 years in the past month. 
 You know, I've had this fantasy my whole life of having a normal family. 
 And when you returned, that became a possibility. 
 And I've been blaming you for not living up to that. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 I'm saying that it's not fair for me to put that on you. 
 I-I don't know. 
 The more I get to know you, the more I like you... 
 As a person. 
 So, maybe we just start with that. 
 I'd like that. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Are you gonna invite me in? 
 Good morning Good morning. 
 Oh, hey. You can't wear that to church. 
 Why not? It's not real church. 
 Of course it is. Change. 
 Please. 
 Listen to your mother, Jacob. 
 Margaret... 
 My behavior the other night... 
 Your behavior? 
 You were honest. 
 I'm feeling kind of ashamed. 
 Lucille, you have nothing to be ashamed of. 
 I can't imagine what Barbara was thinking, showing up here like she was the Belle of the ball. 
 She brought all of that on herself. 
 And if that woman is out of our lives forever, so be it.

 Frederick. 
 Things ended so abruptly the other night after dinner, we didn't get a chance to say goodbye. 
 I was wondering if you join me for breakfast. 
 Good morning, Margaret. 
 Barbara. 
 Good morning. 
 I'm terribly sorry to intrude. 
 Frederick, maybe we can catch up later. 
 Yeah. Sure, ma.

 I've been thinking about what we should call our new church. 
 My wife, Janine, suggested "New Life Church", which I think seems appropriate on many levels. 
 We're still taking suggestions, if there's any. 
 [ Light laughter ] 
 No matter what we call it, some people out there may not like the idea of a church that ministers to the returned. 
 But those of us gathered here today believe that the returned are no different than the living, that they deserve love and understanding and even forgiveness, as do we all. 
 Now, some of you have asked me about an illness that has affected a few people in our community. 
 So, I've invited Dr. Maggie Langston to speak with us today about that briefly. 
 Maggie? 
 Uh, we've had half a dozen cases of this virus. 
 And so far, only returned have acquired it. 
 Right now, it presents with flu-like symptoms. 
 The symptoms can get worse as it progresses. 
 But we've been able to control the illness with medication. 
 So don't delay seeking help if you start to feel sick. 
 Tom : Maggie will stick around after the service if anybody has any questions. 
 Our closing hymn is "for the beauty of the Earth." 
 [ Vehicle door closes ] 
 Good morning, Mrs. Langston. 
 Good morning. 
 Just wanted to come by and check in on you, see how it's been going. 
 Any trouble since you've come back? 
 I imagine this isn't a social call, Agent Bellamy, so just state your business and let's get on with it, shall we? 
 I know about the bones under the factory, the fire, the men who returned. 
 And so does Fred. 
 Does he, now? 
 You know something, too. 
 I think you're the one who dumped those bones into the river. 
 Whatever you think you know, Agent Bellamy, is in the past. 
 It will stay in the past. 
 I wouldn't be so sure about that. 
 The returned have a habit of digging up secrets. 
 Well, I imagine you know quite a bit about secrets. 
 Don't worry, Agent Bellamy. 
 Yours is safe with me. 
 The two men who returned, they were killed again and again. 
 At some point, they stopped returning. 
 Why? 
 Life is a choice, Agent Bellamy, for the living and for the returned, as well. 
 Those men just lost the will to live. 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I'm just heading out. 
 House call at the Langstons'. 
 Ooh! 
 I need the coroner's report on the bones from the river. 
 A friend from my residency went into forensics. She said she'd take a look for us. 
 It's a waste of time. 
 You keep shutting me down. Why? 
 What's going on with you? 
 I just think the government is better equipped to study those remains. 
 Maybe they're in better hands. 
 You did it. 
 What? 
 You turned them over to the government. 
 The reason they knew where to find them is because you told them where they were. 
 God, I knew you were hiding something from me. 
 I'm not hiding. 
 Ever since you came back from Chicago, I could tell. 
 Something happened. 
 That's not true. You don't know... 
 You are lying to me, Marty! 
 I can tell! I know... 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 You're right. Guess I don't. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 
 
 
 How's the new seizure medicine working? 
 Fine, I guess. 
 There haven't been any more incidents since we changed them. 
 I'd say everything looks great. 
 No sign of illness. 
 Am I done? 
 Go. 
 Should we keep him home from school? 
 No, I don't think we're there yet. 
 Besides, if it's only affecting returns, school might be the safest place. 
 Whatever you think is best. 
 Grandma's in the kitchen making lunch if you want to see her. 
 How are you holding up, Mags? 
 Fine. Busy, you know? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 While you're taking care of everybody else in town, you make sure that you take care of yourself, too. 
 I'm fine. 
 Ohh. 
 Okay. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 Thank you. 
 Clean bill of health. 
 Just let me know if anything changes. 
 Are you planning on seeing all of them? 
 Returned? 
 Trying to. 
 There are only a few dozen left in town. 
 And your mother? 
 Heading over to Sam Catlin's next. 
 [ Chuckles ] You won't find her there. 
 No? Where is she? 
 At your father's house. 
 Well, at least that's where she was this morning. 
 Wait. I don't understand. 
 She was... 
  Wearing next to nothing. 
 A joyful reunion, I suppose. 
 Oh, it's none of my business. I just... hope he's going into this with his eyes wide open. 
 I... I should talk to him. 
 Oh, don't do it on my account. 
 I just worry for him. 
 This was always Barbara's pattern. 
 Break up with him, rip out his heart, then reel him back in all over again. 
 Okay. I-I will talk to him. 
 If you think that's best. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Took you long enough. 
 Give me the medicine! 
 Yeah, pharmacy said it's not ready, bro. 
 What? 
 W-w-when's it gonna be ready? 
 They said they'd call. It might be tomorrow. 
 W-well, call them. 
 Tell them it's an emergency. 
 I could be dead by tomorrow. 
 I'm not gonna let that happen, Mikey. 
 [ Announcer speaking indistinctly ] 
 When I get better, things are gonna change around here, starting with you and your crappy attitude. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You know, you've gotten awful soft since I went away. 
 Get ready for me to whip your ass into shape. 
 Carl, do you hear me?! 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
 Hi. 
 Come on in. Stay for dinner? 
 Um, sure. 
 Hey, we've got company. 
 Maggie's here. 
 Mm. 
 Um, how much cayenne do I use? It says a teaspoon? But this seems weak. 
 Hey, Maggie. 
 I think a tablespoon. 
 Mm, okay. 
 We're making my bad luck chili. 
 Oh, wait. That's before your time. 
 Every time we made this chili, the St. Louis cardinals would always lose. 
 It's true. 
 Are you staying for the movie, too? 
 Movie? 
 It's so amazing. 
 You can just order movies right through the TV now. 
 Yeah, your mom wants some romantic comedy. I want anything but. 
 I guess Maggie's the tie-breaker. 
 I am gonna change. 
 I got it. 
 Spit it out. 
 Are you sure about this, dad? 
 I'm sure that you, me, and your mom are about to sit down and watch a movie together. 
 Now, that's pretty unbelievable. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Mm. 
 Okay. 
 Look, honey. 
 Things can't be the way they used to be. 
 I know that. 
 But we can be friends. 
 And I think we both need one right about now. 
 Make sense? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it does. 
 Good. 
 Now, make yourself useful and set the table. 
 Mm! Think about what movie you want to watch. 
 Okay. 
 You know there's no way in hell I'm watching a romantic comedy. 
 [Laughing] 
 That is my girl. 
 It's not happening. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey. 
 How is she? 
 Sleeping. For a while now. 
 I was going to wake her for dinner before it got too late. 
 Uh, it's in the oven if you're hungry. 
 Thanks. 
 Good service today. 
 You were in your element. I was proud of you. 
 We're gonna need more than two dozen members if we're gonna keep the utilities on. 
 They'll come. They always do. 
 Tom! Tom, come here! 
 She won't wake up. 
 Rachael? 
 Rachael! 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Am I catching you at a bad time? 
 Grandma. Uh, hi. 
 No. Uh, just finishing up some paperwork. 
 You sound like something's bothering you. I'm fine. And your father? Look... I know you are worried, but there's no reason to be. They're not getting back together. This is something else. Uh, what do you mean? I don't know. It's just... He seems happy. I'm gonna stay out of it, grandma. And I think you should, too. You're right. I won't interfere anymore. Have a good night. [Beep] [Door opens] Dr. Langston, come quickly. She was fine just a few hours ago. She just said she was tired. She has it, doesn't she? Okay. I need to get her to an exam room. Can you get a wheelchair? Nurse : Yes, Dr. Langston. Rachael, can you hear me? Oh, m-my baby. Okay. We're gonna take care of you. We're gonna take good care of you and your baby. Please save my baby. Okay. We will. Can we get the wheelchair, please? [Cellphone rings] [Beep ] Hey. I'm glad you called. Rachael's sick. She has it. It's serious. Is she gonna be okay? I've got her stabilized, but I don't know. I don't know anything about this. I'll be right there. You need to call them. Maggie. If Rachael can get it, Jacob can get it, too, and if we wait until it's bad... Really bad, it will be too late. I'll make the call.  Thanks. Margaret : Good evening, Barbara. Fred's not here. I've come to see you, actually. I've been thinking about how difficult things have been for you since you returned... Being separated from your daughter, that terrible dinner. I've been so focused on getting my family back together that I've failed to see things from your point of view. I appreciate that. Will you walk with me? [Ringing] [Cellphone rings] Agent Bellamy. You're working late. There's something I need to discuss with you. But before I say anything, I need your word that you won't send in the troops again. This is just between you and me. You know I can't promise that. But I am listening. People are getting sick. It's some kind of virus. It only seems to be affecting the returned. It may have started with Arthur Holmes. He was sick when he came back. Then he disappeared. Has anyone else?  No. Not yet. But it's spreading. Fast. We need help. Thank you for the report. Keep me apprised of the situation. That's it? "Keep me apprised"? There's nothing more I can do for you at this time. You knew about this already. If the situation changes... These people are suffering. They can end up dying again... Permanently. If you know something, I have no useful information to give you at this time. You're lying. Consider this, Agent Bellamy. It's very possible that this is the natural course of things. They return, they get sick, they vanish. We simply don't know. Or care. Always a pleasure, Agent Bellamy. [Both gasp] Oh! Sorry. No, no. It's okay. I didn't know you were home. Uh, yeah. It's fine. I'm just, uh... I'll... I'll be out in a minute. Yeah. Take your time. Okay. How's Rachael? She's stable. I wanted to admit her as a precaution, but she wouldn't let me. She's spending the night at the clinic. Good. I called my contact at the government. And? They're not gonna help. [Scoffs] Why? How bad does this have to get? I guess we're gonna find out. Those bones from the river, they were victims of a fire at your family's factory. They returned and were murdered. Your dad asked me not to pursue it anymore, so I'm not going to. Does he think my family murdered those men? I don't know. It was a long time ago. Only Margaret knows all the details. I'm not even sure she does. I lied. When I said you didn't know anything about me. You do. Probably better than anybody right now. I turned those bones in to the government. Why? [Cellphone rings] [Scoffs] [Sighs] It's the clinic. This is Dr. Langston. Yeah. Keep her comfortable. I'll be right there. Rachael's running a fever. I have to get back. Go. I'll be here. [Sighs] Carl? Little brother, are you there? [Grunts] [Sighs] I'm feeling real bad, Carl. I need some help. [Coughin ] [Sputters] Buddy, please. Carl. Are you there, brother? [Coughing] Carl? Help me. [Coughing continues] Margaret : I would never have come here at this time of night before. Too afraid. Too vulnerable. But not anymore. There's a power in returning. Don't you think? Uh, I don't know. Sit down. Please. This is hard on you, coming back. It's hard on everyone. I imagine for you, things are especially difficult. So many people are angry with you. It hasn't been that bad. I know it's why you went back to your lover when you first returned. Shame. Unrelenting shame. All the things you have done... To your husband, your child. Of course you feel ashamed. It would be inhuman not to. I want to go home. Look at the woman your daughter has become without you. They were better off. And you know that, too. Please. I'm sorry. Please. But that doesn't erase what happened. Jacob still drowned in that river because of you. If I could change the past, then I would. But that's silly. We can't change the past. Only the future. Ever wonder why I got picked? [ Coughs ] Why do I come back and not other people? It seems like whoever's making the decisions up there has got some kind of suck-ass criteria. [Coughing continues] Carl. Do you know why we came back? No. I do. Why? To be punished for our sins. [Sobs] I thought it was a second chance. I thought it could work. Oh, it never will. [Sobbing] They don't want you, Barbara. That's your punishment. [ Sobs ] It's too much. I can't do this anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore, Carl. I don't think I want to be here. [Coughing] [Coughing] [Hacking] It's a choice. All of this pain, it can just... Vanish. How? It's simple. You just let go. Let go? That's right. [Coughing] [Coughing stops] [Sighs] [Cellphone rings] [Coughs] Hello? Mikey Enders disappeared. What? I just got off the phone with Carl. He said he's gone. I'm gonna admit Rachael to the hospital. I don't want to take any more chances. What do you want me to do? Just... Try to figure out what the hell is happening. I'll try. [Breathes deeply] [Coughing] Ambulance is five minutes out. Thanks. Maggie? Elaine? [ Door closes ] What's wrong? Maggie, your mom. What? Elaine, what? I just saw her in the park with your grandmother. A-and then she just disappeared. What are you talking about? Your mom... she's gone. What's it mean? [Voice breaking] That she's gone. Maggie : Marty? [Coughing] [Gasping]
