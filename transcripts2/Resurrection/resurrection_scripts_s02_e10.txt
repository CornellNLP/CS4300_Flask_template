 Previously on "Resurrection"... 
 Is it true there are people who want to hurt us? 
 Yes. 
 That's my baby brother Robert. 
 As soon as it's safe for you, I want to bring you back to Arcadia with me. 
 I married the man I was told to marry. 
 But you learned to love him, right? 
 No. I gave him two sons... an heir and a spare. 
 It's time for you to leave. 
 They don't belong here. 
 [Crowd gasping] 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 This is because of us. 
 I don't want my parents to get hurt anymore. 
 I want to go now. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Jacob? 
 Jacob?! 
 [Wind whistling] 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Jacob! 
 [Thunderclap] Jacob! 
 Jacob?! 
 [Sirens continue in distance] 
 Come on! 
 Jacob! 
 [Rattling] I can't find the damn flashlight! 
 [Thunder continues] 
 Margaret! She moved everything! 
 [Drawer closes, lighter clicks] 
 Lu. 
 The other car... it's gone. 
 What? 
 It's Ma. 
 She took him. 
 [Clatters] 
 It's not working. 
 The emergency radio. 
 We'll radio Fred. 
 [Thunderclap] 
 [Thunder continues] 
 [Praying in Latin] 
 Rursum circumbador pelle mea et in exterminium... 
 [Thunder crashing] 
 [Continues inaudibly] 
 [Lightning strikes] 
 [Wind whooshing] 
 [Thunder rumbling, water dripping] 
 [Door opens] 
 Jacob's missing. 
 What? 
 A bunch of true living showed up at Tom's vigil. 
 A melee broke out, and we lost track of him. 
 You don't think one of them... 
 I don't think so. 
 He seemed to just disappear. 
 [Thunderclap] 
 His blood sample. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 It's all there. 
 What? What's that mean? 
 It means he didn't really disappear. 
 We've got to tell Henry and Lucille. 
 Any phones working yet? 
 No, not here. 
 Phones are out everywhere, even cell phones. 
 Cell tower must have gone down. 
 You think he's all alone out there? 
 [Thunderclap] 
 Let's go. 
 Excuse me. 
 Yeah. 
 [Clatter] 
 Thanks. 
 I said go check the freezer. 
 Oh, right. 
 Hurry. Get rid of the ice before it melts. 
 What about the backup generator? 
 Do we have one? [Scoffs] 
 It's probably in the supply closet. 
 Go! 
 Jeez. 
 [Grunts] 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Panting] 
 Are you okay? 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Ahh! 
 Ahh! [Grunting] 
 [Muttering] 
 Hey, all you all right? 
 Do you want some water or something? 
 Find him... That boy. 
 What? 
 I'm sorry. I can't understand what you're saying. [Mutters indistinctly] 
 The boy. I got to find the boy. 
 Got to save him. 
 What boy? 
 [Inhales sharply] Aah! 
 Are you hurt? 
 Lightning. 
 Oh, my God. 
 S02E10 
Prophecy 
 [thunder rumbling] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Where did he go? 
 Who? 
 The guy. The guy who needed medical attention? 
 He left. 
 He left? 
 He took Eddie's raincoat and left. 
 [Thunderclap] 
 [Laughing continues] 
 [Thunder crashing] 
 [Static whines] 
 Damn thing is useless! 
 I'm going out. 
 Oh, Lu, you can't. 
 I can't sit around here while she's out there doing God knows what. 
 I know, but it's dangerous. 
 Now, please. When we left the vigil, Fred said that he would meet us here if he couldn't get in touch with us by phone. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Henry! 
 She took him! Margaret took him in the car! 
 What? That's a good thing, right? 
 [Door closes] 
 If he's with Margaret, means he's not alone. 
 It's not simple. 
 The last time I saw Ma, we had a fight. 
 It was bad. 
 [Thunderclap] 
 It's working. 
 You really think she could hurt her own grandson? 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 When Barbara disappeared, I suspected Margaret had something to do with it. 
 I confronted her. She didn't deny it. 
 You knew this? 
 Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. She can do that? 
 [Radio static] 
 Man on radio : Sheriff? 
 She's doing this to hurt us. 
 Hold on, Lu. 
 Fred's deputies are already out there. 
 So what? 
 I think you should stay right here. 
 No way! 
 What if he comes home? 
 Do you think it would really be any help, you out there frantically running around? 
 My son is missing! 
 [Thunderclap] 
 If you hear anything, will you call me? 
 Okay, one of my deputies just stopped by Twain's. 
 Elaine was working. She said a man came in, a stranger. 
 Mentioned something about a missing boy, like maybe he'd seen him. 
 Well, what else did he say? 
 He left before they could talk to him. 
 It would be a good thing if somebody saw him. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, aunt Lucille, I'll stay here with you. 
 [Thunderclap] 
 [Thunderclap] 
 [Breathing unevenly] 
 [Thunderclap] 
 [Thunderclap] 
 Where are we? 
 Where it all began. 
 [Radio static] It's Bellamy. 
 Hey, anything? 
 No. You? 
 No. [Radio static] 
 Any deputies? Anything? 
 Maybe we should the factory. 
 Nothing on the statewide APD. 
 Searched every inch of that place, Henry. 
 Woman : Nothing. Just a couple false leads. 
 [Radio static] 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Sniffles, continues crying] 
 Grandma? 
 Hmm? 
 Will it hurt? 
 When we go away? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe it will be like after we died. 
 Maybe. 
 I...don't remember much after I died. 
 Do you? 
 No. 
 I imagine... 
 It'll be like a wonderful adventure. 
 You can go wherever you want to go, do whatever you want to do. [Chuckles] 
 There's no one to tell you how you're supposed to behave, or bends you to their will. 
 And all the people you've ever loved will always think well of you. 
 I'll miss my parents. 
 I know. 
 Maybe I'll see them again after they die. 
 Maybe. 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 I can't sleep anymore. 
 What's that sound? 
 That's the water from the falls by the sawmill. 
 I used to love that sound. 
 Put me to sleep when I was a little girl. 
 Is that what you were thinking about when I got up? 
 I was thinking about the last time I was here. 
 It was my wedding day. 
 I was hiding. 
 Why were you hiding? 
 It's... complicated. 
 You said you would tell me anything. 
 [Exhales] 
 Try to get a little more rest, hmm? 
 [Thunderclap] 
 [Radio beeps] 
 Man : Main street's all clear. So is forest. 
 [Beep] Man: No sign of them down here by the docks. 
 Man : Nobody here at the youth center. 
 Playgrounds are empty. [Beep] 
 Fred, yesterday when... hey, forget it. 
 No. Listen. 
 [Radio chatter continues, wipers whirring] 
 I can see now how blind I've been about Ma. 
 Well, she has a way of making people see exactly what she wants them to see. 
 Somehow you always understood that about her. 
 Hmm. 
 You're a different person now than you were before she died. 
 Man : Some kids downtown. Nobody's seen them. 
 Should we call Lucille? 
 No, nothing to report. 
 Let's hold off for a bit. 
 [Radio chatter continues] 
 I dozed off, and when I got up, he wasn't here. 
 Henry, he's been gone too long. 
 Something is not right. 
 I can feel it. 
 Okay. 
 Fine. Yes. I'll wait for your call. 
 [Thunder crashing] 
 [Breathing unevenly] 
 Aunt Lucille. 
 Aunt Lucille, they'll call as soon as they find him. 
 Margaret probably took him someplace out of the storm. 
 This can't go on all night. 
 I have to sleep, or I'll be useless. 
 I'm sure they'll find him before that. 
 And I'll be here with you. 
 I'm not going anywhere, okay? 
 Yes. I know. 
 [Breathing unevenly] 
 Okay. 
 Why don't we have some tea, try to relax a bit? 
 Tea. [Exhales] 
 That sounds nice. 
 Thank you. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Exhales] 
 You were right. It was nothing. 
 We pass the land mine? 
 We're halfway to Newton. 
 [Sighs] I don't think she'd venture much past Arcadia. 
 It's all she knew. 
 Yeah. We'll take pretty brook on the way back. 
 Wait. 
 You were right. 
 Jacob's death changed me. 
 Changed Lucille, too. 
 Yeah. How could it not? 
 I don't know if we could survive another blow like that. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. We're gonna find him. I know it. 
 And if what happened that day didn't tear you apart, nothing will. 
 [Radio static] 
 Deputy Gonzalez: Uh, sheriff? 
 Yeah? 
 Just spoke to Jack Gansvoort. 
 He said a few hours ago he ran into a stranger in a raincoat... male, 30s. 
 The man asked gansvoort for directions for the old sawmill. 
 Man saying anything else? 
 That's all. 
 Bellamy, you get that? 
 Copy. I heard. 
 Okay. Meet us at the top of old sawmill road. 
 Hey. It's a lead. 
 [Engine starts, siren wailing] 
 I never talked to you about that day... the day Jacob and your mother died. 
 Um... 
 No, I guess not. [Chuckles] 
 But I could understand why. 
 I had an exam that evening. 
 An exam? 
 Yeah, I was getting my master's in biology. 
 I didn't know you went to grad school. 
 Well... 
 I never finished. 
 Not like you. 
 I'd stay up late studying. 
 Henry was worried about me. 
 "This can't go on all night," 
 I recall him saying once. 
 "You have to sleep, or you'll be useless." 
 And that day, I dozed off with a book on my chest. 
 And I woke up. 
 Jacob wasn't in the house. 
 I was sleeping, and he was drowning. 
 Aunt Lucille, you're not... you can't blame yourself for... 
 I know. 
 [Teacup clatters] 
 I can't imagine that. 
 I can't imagine what it must have been like to lose him. 
 As horrible as that day was... 
 [Breath quavers] 
 I would rather have lost him and never got him back than never have had him at all. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Can I hear the story now? 
 The one about your wedding day? 
 Are you sure? It's a sad one. 
 Is it scary, too? 
 Oh, yes. 
 It all started with my father. 
 He worked at the old factory. 
 [Men shouting] 
 He was a foreman and was supposed to watch over the workers. 
 But he worked for a bad man. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 He made my father do... Bad things. 
 [Men screaming, coughing] 
 And then he made him do more bad things to cover them up. 
 This is the story, isn't it? 
 The one you told me about the villagers and the demons they had to kill. 
 Yes, it is. 
 What happened next? 
 In return for my father's loyalty, he was told his dauger could have a better life. 
 
 
 
 [Door opens] 
 Jacob : How? [Gasps] 
 Dad, please don't make me do this. 
 [Gasping] 
 Margaret : By marrying into the family. 
 [Gasping] Jacob: Did you? 
 Did you have a better life? 
 It brought me you, didn't it? 
 Excuse me. 
 [Car door closes] 
 Have you seen an 8-year-old boy around here? 
 No. 
 What are you doing out here? 
 I was looking for someone, but he's gone now. 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 [Tires screech, engine shuts off] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Car doors close] 
 Who's that guy? He know anything? 
 No. 
 Other side of that hill, that's where they used to house some of the sawmill workers. 
 Some of the factory workers, too. 
 Henry, isn't the old cwik farm just up the road? 
 Yeah, it's... just the other side of the old sawmill. 
 When our mother was a young girl, she lived with her dad on a little farm. 
 I think the barn's still standing. 
 Let's go. 
 So... the demons are like us? Returned? 
 In the story, yes. 
 Are they the first returned? 
 The ones your father had to kill? 
 They were the first ones I knew about. 
 Why did they come back? 
 I believed they returned to punish our family. 
 To haunt us and make us pay for our sins. 
 It was our family, the Langstons, that hurt those men. 
 That broke the town. 
 They caused the sickness, the strife. 
 Our family is cursed. 
 So we came back to hurt people? 
 Is that why those people in town don't like us? 
 The ones who pushed my dad and killed Tom? 
 For a time, I thought we might be able to help the living. 
 I wanted to help your Uncle, because I could see he was hurting. 
 I wanted to help your father be the man he once was. 
 But all my plans backfired. 
 And that's why I'm going to go away. 
 So I won't cause any more pain. 
 Then I'm coming with you. 
 Henry. Is that your car? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll take the back. 
 Jacob! Son! 
 [Breathing unevenly] 
 Where is he? 
 What did you do? 
 Jacob wants to be with me right now. 
 He doesn't want to go with you. 
 You stop that! 
 You stop putting ideas in his head. 
 He's my son. 
 It's not that simple, Henry. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Jacob! 
 Henry... 
 Come on, son. Come over here. 
 Jacob, please, you come with your dad. 
 [Exhales sharply] Now you listen, mom. 
 We may have had our differences, but you need to give me back my son! 
 Henry! 
 We all know how this works. 
 We all know what she's capable of. 
 What I'm capable of? 
 Grandma! Stop it! Stop! 
 Get off of me! 
 Go away! I don't want to go! Stop! 
 I want to stay here! Go away! 
 Did you honestly think I'd hurt my own grandson? 
 Do you think I'm some kind of monster? 
 I... I... 
 I've had all night to think about how I've gotten to this point. 
 Where I went wrong. 
 Hating myself. 
 Now I realize it wasn't me at all. 
 Everything I've done, I've done for the Langstons. 
 I've given my life to them. 
 My father was a broken man because of them. 
 He had to murder people. 
 And what did he get in return? 
 What did I get? 
 I got to marry a man I hated. 
 Your pathetic, drunken father. 
 All so my children could have a live of privilege and ease. 
 I created a bubble around you both, and you did nothing but suffocate in it. 
 Even after death, I tried to protect you. 
 No wonder you both hate me. 
 Because I've always hated the Langston in you. 
 The weakness. 
 Finally it's all clear to me. 
 Deep down, I've always... hated both of you. 
 Well... 
 At least you're finally telling the truth. 
 [Footsteps depart] 
 [Door closes] 
 I already called Lucille. You need help with Margaret? 
 No. Family matter. 
 I'll make the arrangements. 
 You should get them home. Lucille's waiting. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Engine starts] 
 If I know your mom, she's fixing your favorite meal right about now. 
 And if I know you, you'll eat two of them. 
 Look, monkey, this was pretty scary for your mom and me, and I can only imagine how scary it was for you. 
 Your grandma... 
 She didn't do anything. 
 She didn't do anything wrong. 
 Oh, thank God! Oh, thank God! 
 [Crying] 
 Oh! Oh! 
 Are you okay? 
 Are you hungry? 
 Are you sure? 
 Okay. 
 [Cell phone vibrating] 
 Is everything okay? 
 I think they're a bit... shell-shocked. 
 Understandable. 
 I just got word the stem cell serum's ready. 
 Are you still symptom-free from the meds? 
 As far as I can tell. 
 Stop by the clinic when you get a chance. 
 Once we give you the serum, you'll be fully cured in 24 hours. 
 Sounds good. 
 [Video game playing indistinctly] 
 Hey, buddy. 
 [Door closes] 
 I know you're feeling bad. 
 But your parents... they love you. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Line rings] 
 [Ring] 
 Woman : Hello? 
 I need a favor. 
 [Door closes] 
 Jenny. 
 You okay? 
 Is it true? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm your brother. 
 Can I see? 
 Robert! 
 So... I'm gonna live with you now? 
 Looks like it. 
 Are you married? 
 No. 
 You don't have a family? 
 I have you. 
 That's not a family. 
 Well, I do have a friend. Would you like to meet her? 
 You like ice cream? 
 Hop in. 
 Hey. 
 [Closes cabinet] 
 You okay? 
 I wanted to tell you something. 
 [Sighs] 
 I went with grandma because I didn't want to hurt you anymore. 
 But then I was thinking about you. 
 I was thinking about you, and... 
 I didn't want to go away anymore. 
 I was thinking about you, too. 
 Please don't. 
 What are you looking for? 
 I'm not looking for anything. 
 I'm trying to figure out where your mother put everything when she rearranged the place so I can figure out how to put everything back. 
 Yeah, my mother. 
 Rather not talk about her right now. 
 Yeah, I would imagine you wouldn't. 
 Fred's taking her away as we speak. 
 It doesn't matter where Margaret is. 
 The damage has been done. 
 Damage? 
 Lu? 
 What does that mean, exactly? "Damage"? 
 He's back, isn't he? A little shaken up, that's all. 
 Shaken up? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, that's all it is. 
 What do you expect, Lu? 
 He's been through a lot. 
 It's scary for a kid. 
 These things take time. 
 That's right. They take time. 
 They take a lifetime sometimes. 
 What are you saying? He has one bad night, and now he's screwed up for life? 
 It wasn't just one bad night. 
 Yes, it was. 
 It was one... Awful, terrifying night. 
 And how long has it taken you? 
 What? 
 Nothing. Never mind. 
 No, tell me. I want to know. 
 [Clattering] 
 You're saying I'm screwed up, is that it? 
 Why? Because I love my mother, faults and all? 
 Do you think that I wanted this to happen? 
 Let's just forget about it. 
 No, let's be honest. 
 I want you to tell me. First it was, "oh, I don't know how to grieve for my son." Hmm. 
 "I don't know how to"... what? 
 Feel sad, feel... Anything! 
 Well, my mother returned, and I was happy about it. 
 I felt good! And what's wrong with that? 
 I warned you! I warned you about her! 
 What?! 
 You were so focused on trying to please her with that stupid factory deal that you didn't see how she was poisoning the mind of your own son. 
 Are you blaming me for what happened? 
 I never blamed you for Jacob's death! 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 I think you should leave this house. 
 I think you shouldn't come back tonight. 
 I think that's a good idea. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [car door opens] 
 [Bird cawing] 
 When is this van coming? 
 Soon. 
 [Exhales] 
 What do you know about this facility? 
 Not much. 
 [Exhales] 
 How did you do it? 
 How did you make Barbara go away? 
 I just... encouraged her to give up. 
 Give up? 
 To let go. 
 That's all it takes. 
 And you knew this how? 
 You did it to those factory workers? 
 No. They did it to themselves. 
 I don't even think they knew what they were doing. 
 They were all chained up against the barn, waiting to be killed for the fourth time. 
 [Sighs] 
 I heard them talking. 
 I was curious, so I crept up and watched them from behind the barn wall. 
 The white one with the leg brace, he was distraught. 
 And in an effort to ease his suffering, the black fellow, he... told him to just... let go. 
 He kept repeating it. 
 "It's okay. Just let go." 
 And I knew it was absolutely necessary that his mind go blank. 
 That he not think of... anything... or anyone. 
 Then and only then did the man disappear. 
 How old were you when you saw this? 
 I was 10. 
 Were you really gonna disappear yourself? 
 I suppose I was. 
 But it's hard to choose annihilation when you're looking into the eyes of an 8-year-old boy. 
 Let's go. 
 What are you doing? 
 I got a cabin about a mile north of here, ma. 
 No. I'm gonna bring supplies tomorrow. 
 No. Why? 
 Why would you do that for me? 
 I've never really felt like a Langston, either. 
 I don't hate you, Frederick. 
 I know, Ma. 
 This is for the best. 
 I want to go to the facility. 
 Uh, uh... 
 I want to be with my own kind. 
 Ma... 
 I like your dress, Jenny. It's pretty. 
 [Chuckles] Thanks. I like your pants. 
 I wasn't allowed to wear pants before. 
 Do you think I could get some now? 
 Yeah, I think that could be arranged. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I could take you on a shopping spree. 
 How's that sound? 
 Yeah? Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 I intercepted the waitress. 
 Thanks, Marty. 
 I mean... Robert. 
 We could can stick to "Marty." 
 [Chuckles] 
 So... Why aren't you married? 
 [Giggles] Preacher! 
 Jenny girl! Ah! [Giggles] 
 Oh you got big fast. 
 [Giggles] Ah. 
 I thought you were dead. 
 So did I. 
 How you doing? 
 Preacher James, it's Robert, my brother. 
 He's old now because he came back before we did. 
 Robert. 
 You're returned? 
 You have family here? Place to stay? 
 I'll make do. 
 It's nice to meet you, Robert. 
 Jenny girl, I'll see you around. 
 Promise. 
 Promise. [Giggles] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Insects, birds chirping] 
 [Low rumbling] 
 [Groans softly] 
 [Rumbling continues] 
 [Buzzing] 
 [Loud burst] [Gasps] 
 [Loud buzzing] 
 You saw it, didn't you? 
 [Panting] What just happened? 
 I died trying to save you in the flood, Robert. 
 You were lost. Now I found you. 
 This place is sick. 
 But together, we will heal it.
