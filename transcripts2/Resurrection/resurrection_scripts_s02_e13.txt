 Previously on "Resurrection"... 
 What exactly happened this morning? 
 We were all asleep in our beds. 
 The next minute, we were standing in front of a bar in Arcadia. 
 Mass returns have typically been accompanied by a trigger. 
 You're saying there's another on the way? 
 Yes. A big one. 
 Angela : Agent Bellamy seems to think you can offer our guests here some comfort. 
 Preacher James : God willing. 
 He poisoned them all. 
 That child has gestated in death. 
 It must not be born. 
 It's Rachael. She's inside. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's the baby. I can feel it. It's hurting me. 
 The preacher... 
 He brought up your mom, talked about how she disappeared Barbara. 
 Fred :  Do you think he's trying to do the same thing to Rachael? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Preacher James : I have a mission, Robert. 
 To prevent the end of the world. 
 I know where the mother is. 
 We're gonna have a shootin' contest. 
 Well, I'm glad you'll be there! 
 It is a grand opportunity for you to show your stuff. 
 [ Both continue speaking indistinctly ] 
 [Groans] 
 What is it? 
 How's it going out here? 
 Well, it's quiet. 
 [Sighs] 
 Anything? 
 It's all good. How's Rachael? 
 She's coming along. Maggie doesn't seem worried. 
 Good. Let's hope it stays that way. 
 Did you hear any more from Marty? 
 Not yet. 
 Well... 
 I'm sure he'll be back soon. 
 [ Up-tempo music playing ] 
 [Door hinges creak] 
 Maggie : [ In distance ] I'll be right back. 
 Just keep breathing. You're doing great. 
 Time for bed, kids. 
 Prettiest thing I ever did see. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Are you feeling all right? 
 You don't have a fever. 
 It's my head. It just hurts. 
 Mm. I'll get you something. 
 Why didn't you tell her? 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 [Sighs] 
 Margaret? 
 Hello, Rachael. 
 [Sighs] 
 W-what are you doing here? 
 I could ask you the same thing. 
 This  is  my room. 
 Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't realize. 
 I've come with a message from Preacher James. 
 The preacher? 
 Well, what is it? 
 How would you like to be with Tom again? 
 ♪ 
 You don't have to do this. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 Don't listen to him! 
 [Banging on door] 
 Why are you doing this? Let me out! 
 No, I don't have a choice 'cause you proved yourself untrustworthy. 
 Now, I had believed because of our vision that we would accomplish our purpose together. 
 What purpose? Killing a baby? 
 Now, you saw the cicadas in our vision. 
 If that child brings millions more of us back, this world can't survive that. 
 So, I'm gonna leave you here. 
 [Pounding on door] 
 [Country music playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Thump] 
 And this preacher's gonna keep making these things feel like they've got a God-given right to be here, which is why we can't let off the gas. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Tom was one thing. 
 But rumor has it this guy can actually bring them back himself. 
 If I see him doing that... 
 I'm giving him a one-way ticket home. 
 I know you think I'm your enemy. 
 Maybe I am. 
 But I believe tonight we have a common goal. 
 [Grunting] 
 Rachael? 
 Rachael, the door's locked. Can you open it? 
 Rachael?! 
 Rachael, are you okay? 
 What's wrong? 
 [Grunting] 
 [Panting] 
 Dad. Dad, something's wrong. Rachael's locked in. She's not responding. 
 Wait here. Wait here. 
 [Banging on door] 
 I don't hear anything. 
 Rachael?! 
 Okay. Stand back. 
 [Slam] 
 What are you doing? 
 Get out. Stand up. 
 You stand up! 
 We were only talking. 
 You have no business being here. 
 Rachael, you okay? Rachael? 
 Rachael? 
 I... 
 Okay, breathe. Breathe, Rachael. You're fine. 
 [Groans] 
 You're fine. 
 What did you say to her? Tell me. 
 What the hell is she doing here? 
 She broke in. 
 Grandma? 
 Jacob! Jacob, tell them. 
 Tell them about that baby. Tell them. 
 You don't get to talk to him. 
 That woman and her child... 
 I was willing... 
 ...are hurting your son. 
 ...To give you a chance, and you do something like this? 
 Jacob, tell them! 
 You're scaring him. 
 Jacob. 
 Obviously, he doesn't agree with you. 
 Jacob, please! You must tell them that baby is bad. 
 What's she doing here? 
 It's okay. Rachael's fine. 
 We got to go. The preacher's coming with a bunch of returned... 
 We got to move Rachael. 
 Where? 
 Marty? 
 Go stay with Jacob. Jenny, it's gonna be okay. 
 Get that woman out of this house. 
 You're all making a terrible mistake! 
 Look. Enough. 
 Let's go. 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 Marty! 
 This is what I was trying to prevent. 
 Get back in the house. 
 You chose your side. 
 Henry. 
 [Murmuring continues] 
 What are you doing? 
 I told you I'd take care of it. 
 Clearly, you did not. 
 What are they all doing here? 
 It's because of me. 
 It's all my fault. 
 Margaret? 
 No. There wasn't enough time. 
 You're going to have to do it. 
 Well, then, tell me how. 
 Preacher James : Robert! 
 I don't mean anyone in that house any harm! 
 I'm a man of peace! 
 But don't force my hand! 
 Give up the girl, and we can all go home! 
 Robert! 
 This is sheriff Langston. Any deputies available? 
 [In distance] Robert! 
 I'll call my government contact. 
 There must be a hundred of them out there. 
 Henry : At least. 
 Hello? Anyone? 
 [Ringing] 
 Pick up. Pick up. 
 Angela, come on. Pick up. 
 [Ringing] 
 [Ringing continues in distance] 
 [Ringing continues] 
 Nothing. 
 Something must be wrong with my radio. 
 I'll call the station. 
 I'll check out back. 
 [Ringing] 
 Man : Arcadia sheriff's station. 
 Yeah, th... 
 Who is this? 
 This is Joey. 
 Joey? 
 Joey nolan? 
 How did you...  listen, sheriff. 
 Preacher paid me a visit at Twain's tonight, told me about that girl you got at Henry's. 
 Listen. Whatever he said to you... 
 No, no, no, no, no. I told you before.  They're not natural, sheriff. 
 We don't need any more coming our way. 
 Now, if I were you, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting on any deputies to get to Henry's house. 
 They're otherwise occupied at the moment. 
 Joey!  
 You have a good night, sheriff. 
 [Click] 
 Son of a bitch! 
 It's all clear out back. 
 What's going on? 
 No one's coming to help us. 
 What? What do you mean? 
 We're on our own. 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 Is the preacher here? 
 What did my grandmother tell you? 
 [Whimpers] 
 Okay. 
 You need to focus on having this baby, all right? Everything is gonna be fine. 
 Nothing is fine! 
 How do you expect me to feel safe if you keep lying to me? 
 You're right. 
 It's not fine. 
 There are about a hundred returneds standing outside, and they're not here to spread good will. 
 Maggie, Maggie... No, no, no. 
 What? 
 What are they doing here? 
 Oh, God. Is it about my baby? 
 Listen to me, Rachael. 
 This child will be born, okay? 
 And I'm the one who's gonna make sure that that happens. 
 Look at me. 
 You just have to stay strong. 
 What do you think they plan to do? 
 How far are they gonna go with this? 
 Preacher James thinks that Rachael's baby is some kind of demon. 
 He knows he can't kill her, so he wants to disappear Rachael before the baby's born. 
 Man : [In distance] Give up the girl! 
 I'm gonna go out there. 
 I'll talk to him. 
 Get a lay of the land. 
 What are you waiting for? Let's go! 
 Fred, don't. 
 I'll go. 
 I don't think this guy's messing around, Henry. 
 Which is why I should go. 
 He brought me back. 
 We share a connection. 
 Man : [In distance] Better give her up! 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 Preacher. 
 Henry. 
 Preacher, you gave me a second chance at life. 
 But now you want to hurt Rachael and her child. 
 I don't understand that. 
 You have no idea what will happen if that devil is born. 
 [Crowd agreeing indistinctly] 
 "For false prophets shall arise and produce great works and wonders so as to lead astray and deceive." 
 It's been a long time since Bible school, preacher. 
 Well, that trance that brought you and all of us into town, that child in there's behind that. 
 So I hear. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So, what happens if that occurs again, only this time, the child turns you against your fellow man, maybe even your wife? 
 But... 
 Why are you so convinced of all this? 
 Yesterday was just the beginning. 
 This has all been foretold. 
 Foretold? 
 To who? To you? 
 But who are you to say what's good or bad or... 
 Who should live or die? 
 That's not your call to make. 
 You must believe what you see right in front of you, Henry. 
 That child is hurting Jacob. He told me so. 
 He's an 8-year-old boy. 
 You must understand that even though... 
 No, ma! You must understand. 
 You no longer make decisions for this family! 
 Preacher James : Your mother's right. 
 Think of Jacob. 
 Are you prepared to lose him again? 
 I'm not gonna sacrifice somebody else's child for my own. 
 That is a noble sentiment. 
 But I don't believe you. 
 [Sighs] 
 You prey on people's weaknesses, get them to do what you want. 
 Did your God teach you to do that? 
 Henry, what'd he say? 
 I think ma truly believes that.. 
 Rachael's baby's hurting Jacob. 
 Hurting him? 
 Luce, this guy's pulling everyone's strings. 
 I'm going to check on him. 
 What's on your mind? 
 That child. 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 It's never known anything but death. 
 It's not like us. 
 It's not like anybody. 
 Are you saying we should just hand Rachael over? 
 Henry... 
 People weren't willing to give  us  a chance. 
 How can we assume the worst of this child? 
 Still.. 
 We don't know what's really going on. 
 Nobody does. What if he's right? 
 What if that baby being born is the beginning of the end? 
 Henry, are you a devil? 
 Is Jacob? 
 Is Marty? 
 Don't give in to fear like I did. 
 He wants us to hand Rachael over. 
 Otherwise, they're gonna charge in and take her. 
 How long do we have? 
 10 minutes. 
 Then they're coming in. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Jenny, could you step out, please? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thanks, sweetheart. 
 Is your head still hurting? you can tell me. 
 I didn't mean for this to happen. 
 I told grandma why I don't feel good, and now... 
 Now she's here. 
 What's making you not feel good? 
 Does this have something to do with Rachael? 
 And her baby? 
 [ sighing ] 
 I hurt when the baby hurts. 
 But I don't want Rachael to get in trouble because of it. 
 Oh, sweetheart. 
 You want to go out there with Jacob? 
 You're not listening to me. 
 He said it's the  baby who's making him feel sick. 
 Well, even if that's true, it doesn't... 
 If they're gonna storm this house, Jacob and Jenny should not be here. 
 They're not gonna harm us. It's Rachael they want. 
 We can't take that chance. 
 I've thought of every way this could play out, every option, and every one of them ends badly. 
 We need to protect these children. 
 Lucille's gonna leave with the kids. 
 Fred, I-I think you should go, too. 
 Not with Maggie here. 
 You sure? 
 I am. 
 You should go now. 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 [ Crowd murmuring ] 
 [ Footsteps ] 
 Jenny. 
 Don't be afraid. 
 It's my job to tell  you  that. 
 Even though you're all grown up, I'm still your big sister. 
 [ Crowd murmuring ] 
 Man : Where do you think you're going? 
 Woman : Don't let her go anywhere. 
 Man #2 : Don't let them leave! 
 Don't you dare. 
 Margaret : That's my grandson. 
 We could use him to get Rachael. 
 Get away! 
 Jacob, you won't have to worry about that child anymore. 
 Jacob? 
 I didn't want this. 
 I didn't mean for Rachael to get hurt. 
 In time, they'll thank you for what you're doing. 
 So will our brothers and sisters who didn't have the courage to stay. 
 They're not gonna give up without a fight. 
 Well, neither will we. 
 [ Crowd murmuring ] 
 The less thinking, the better. 
 What if it's ma that comes through that door? 
 Like I said, the less thinking, the better. 
 All right. 
 Let's check the windows, barricade the back door. 
 You have everything you need? 
 Yes. 
 I want you to go into Rachael's room. 
 I don't want you to come out, no matter what's happening. 
 Okay, but what if I hear something horrible? 
 What if... 
 Just be there for Rachael. 
 All you need to think about is her. 
 What are  you  gonna do? 
 I'll be thinking about you. 
 Promise you'll be careful. 
 I will. 
 I promise. 
 Aah! 
 Go. Go. 
 Man : All we want is the girl! 
 Send her out! 
 What happened? 
 You all right?  
 Yeah. 
 If anyone comes through that door, shoot them. 
 Breathe. Breathe. In. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 Man : Time's up! 
 They've been given a chance. 
 They're not gonna hand her over, Preacher. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 All right, men. Let's go!  
 Let's go. 
 Stay together. 
 Go, go, go! Stay left. Stay together. 
 They're moving towards us. 
 They're coming around this side, too. 
 I'll cover the back. 
 Preacher James : Y'all stay together. Move over on the left side of the house. 
 Fred... 
 I don't know if I can shoot somebody. 
 Hen, just try to remember, they'll come back. 
 Woman : Let's go! 
 [ Crowd shouting indistinctly ] 
 Stand back, or I'll shoot! 
 [ Indistinct shouting continues ] 
 Stay back. 
 Stay back! 
 Remember, they can't kill you! 
 Come on! Everybody! Let's go! 
 [ Glass shatters ] 
 [ Both gasp ] 
 Aah! 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Dad? Marty? Are you guys okay? 
 Maggie, we're okay! Stay up there! 
 What happened? You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 [ All breathing heavily ] 
 [ Crowd shouting ] 
 Stay back. Stay back! Stay back! 
 Stop right now. 
 Don't move. 
 Don't move! 
 Stay back! There's too many of them! 
 [ All grunting ] 
 Fred! 
 Get off! 
 Fred! Fred! 
 [ Shouting in distance ] 
 Hey, Rachael, I need you to stay strong, okay? 
 Stay with it. You're doing great, okay? 
 I can't. I can't. I can't do this. 
 Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Keep going. 
 What do they want with me? 
 What do they want with my baby? 
 Don't worry about that. 
 Don't worry about that. 
 Don't worry about that. 
 Why won't they just leave me alone? 
 Breathe. It's okay. You have to keep going. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 No. 
 No, you stay away from her! 
 Stay back! 
 Leave her alone! 
 Maggie : No!  
 Maggie! 
 Maggie! 
 Maggie! 
 Henry : Maggie? 
 No! Get off me! 
 Marty : Maggie! Fred, what... 
 Get off me! Get off me! 
 [ Men shouting indistinctly ] 
 Henry : Fred, no! 
 Maggie?! Maggie?! 
 Maggie?! 
 Maggie?! 
 [ Indistinct shouting continues ] 
 Ohh! No. 
 Fred! 
 Fred! 
 [ Crying ] Please. Please. 
 Oh, Maggie!  
 Get off of me! 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Maggie, it's okay, sweetheart. 
 Dad! Marty?! Marty?! 
 Calm down, Maggie. It's okay. 
 Are you okay? 
 Mag! 
 Leave me alone! 
 Dad! 
 Let her go! 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 Fred : It's okay. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 There was no need for any of this. 
 You created this situation. 
 Tie them up. 
 [ Maggie whimpering ] 
 Dad? 
 It's okay, sweetheart. 
 [ Indistinct talking ] 
 What do you want from me? 
 Why? Why are they here? 
 Why were they all gathered outside your window yesterday, Rachael? 
 It's never gonna end. 
 What did I do to deserve this? 
 You returned. 
 We all did. 
 We're never gonna be accepted. So this is cost for coming back. 
 [ Groans ] 
 This pain. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Do you remember where you were before you came back, Rachael? 
 [ Inhales sharply ] 
 Um... 
 Uh, I've had dreams. 
 We all have. 
 The place where we belong. 
 This world, this life... 
 Do you really want to bring your child into that, when your time here as a returned has been defined by pain? 
 It's... all... there is. 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 Here, maybe. 
 Not there. 
 There's still time. 
 Margaret said that you saw Tom. 
 Is that true? 
 Is... is he waiting for me? 
 Yes, he is. 
 I saw him with my own eyes. 
 And if you go to him, all your suffering will end now. 
 [ Whimpers ] 
 Oh, it's coming soon. 
 Put that out of your mind. 
 Shh. 
 All that distress... 
 All that horror, everything... let it go. 
 Tom is there, waiting for you to join him. 
 I'm scared. What about my baby? 
 You'll all be there together... 
 ...in a place that knows no pain... 
 ...only love. 
 Now, why would you want to keep your child from that? 
 Why would you want to keep Nathaniel from his daddy? 
 How do you know his name? 
 Tom. 
 He told me. 
 [ Crowd murmuring ] 
 [ Clock ticking ] 
 Give me the gun. 
 You've done enough already. Wait outside. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 I told the preacher how to make Rachael and her baby disappear. 
 I was only thinking of Jacob. 
 Go. Go up. 
 Go, before it's too late. 
 Get away from her. 
 It's for the best. 
 I said get away from her. 
 No. No, you stay away from me. 
 He's lying. 
 Whatever he said to you, it's a lie. 
 No! 
 [ Groans ] 
 No! 
 Tom is waiting for me. 
 He's waiting for both of us. 
 Listen to me. 
 He's only telling you what you want to hear. 
 I tried to protect you. That's why I kept this from you. 
 He thinks that your son is evil. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I'll be honest with you, Rachael. 
 That child is only gonna bring suffering into this world. 
 But he's my child. 
 No, he is not. 
 And I've been sent by God to stop him. 
 No. No. 
 Rachael, there is no God that would ask that of anyone. 
 Oh, now he believes in God! 
 What I believe is no child is born evil. 
 Your child is no different. 
 [ Groans ] 
 I'll get him out of here and bring up Maggie, okay? 
 [ Groaning ] 
 Marty! 
 Rachael. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Breathe. 
 Don't you move. 
 All right, I think it's coming. 
 Okay. Okay. Get ready to push soon, okay? 
 Breathe. 
 [ Groaning, gasping ] 
 [ Screaming ] 
 [ Crow cawing ] 
 [ Swing creaking ] 
 [ Bird singing ] 
 [ Footsteps ] 
 Maggie : Rachael. 
 Wake up. 
 [ Baby coos ] 
 Someone's hungry. 
 Mm. 
 Hey. 
 Come here. 
 He's perfect. 
 Yeah, he is, isn't he? 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you both. 
 You need to come see this. 
 Newscaster :  ...To communicate that if there is not an urgent... 
 It's happening everywhere. 
 Returned. All over the world. 
 ...for official government use. 
 As we told you an hour ago, the reports continue to pour in from all over the globe of the impossible... 
 That people are apparently returning from the dead. 
 All of you out there will know more as soon as we do. 
 The president is expected to make a statement within the hour, and hopefully he will be able to shed light on what has left the world in a state of bewilderment. 
 We know he has been in communication... [ Birds singing ] Marty : The world's changed a lot since you've been gone. You're probably more than a little confused, huh? Don't worry. That's normal for anyone who's recently returned. I looked through your file, saw that you have a grandson in St. Louis. Good news. I contacted him, and he's open to have you staying with him. Bad news. Not everyone is as accepting as your grandson. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. You may experience threats, discrimination. But if you do... You can contact me immediately. The bureau is here to help. I got it. How about this? Marty and Maggie and Elaine are coming over for dinner tonight. How 'bout  you  tag along? And be a third wheel? Actually, it would be a  fourth wheel, but who's counting? [ Chuckles ] Come on. Lu's making pork chops. You know, it kind of sounds like an afterthought. Okay. Hey, by the way, you hear about that new bill in congress about the returned? It's a joke. The senate will kill it. It's progress. Says the man who still has all his rights. I mean, answer me this. What kind of sense does it make that I should still be paying taxes... Even though I can't vote? What's that old saying? Death and taxes? But scratch the death part. [ Chuckles ] What? How's she doing? She misses her son. Robert. So, how's life in suicide watch? [ Inhales deeply ] Mm... Well, I must say, it's pretty lifeless. How about you? How's the world outside? Still spinning. Hmm. Tell me about those riots in Philadelphia. That was an unfortunate incident. And those fires in Tokyo. The world's not perfect. It never was. Tolerance is not gonna come overnight. No, it will not. Doesn't it just make your skin crawl, Robert... ...this truth we share, this connection of ours? To deny that's to deny yourself. I'm not denying anything. Then you know the end of times is still upon us. It's self-evident. So, why don't you disappear yourself? 'Cause I choose to remain until called upon to fight the evil that you brought into this world. So, how is he... That  innocent  soul? He's good. He's a normal baby boy. [ Chuckles ] "And even Satan... Shall disguise himself as an angel of light." Corinthians 11:14. Religious studies. Hmm. It's a perk of the new job. Another perk is I have to learn how to tolerate everyone... Even the likes of you. I just came to say goodbye, preacher. I won't be visiting anymore. Well, I blame myself, Robert. I never should have put my faith in a man who's ruled by doubt. [ Doorbell rings ] Can you...? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. [ Jazz music playing quietly ] Hi, there. Hey. Marty, look what Elaine drew for me. Cool. What is it? She said it's whatever I want it to be. In that case, it's great. [ Chuckles ] What's up? I went to see the preacher again. Marty... Why? Sometimes, it's just so tempting to see the world the way he does... Black and white, good and evil. Yeah, but you know there's no such thing. There's just people. And they're looking to you for help. Maggie, how can I help the returned when I don't even know why they're here? Well,  none  of us know why we're here. But that doesn't stop us from living. And I want to live with you. Come on. Believe it or not, I actually made some of this dinner. No. Yeah. Jacob : Marty. [ Chuckles ] What's up, buddy? Punctual as ever. I'm sorry. I had to make a stop along the way. Ohh, you're forgiven. Well, it seems like ages since we've seen you. Good to see you. Just been working hard. Be careful. Someday, you're gonna wake up, and you're gonna be as old as Fred. Yeah, exactly. Rachael : ♪ there was a boy a very strange, enchanting boy ♪ 
♪ they say he traveled very far, very far over land and sea ♪
