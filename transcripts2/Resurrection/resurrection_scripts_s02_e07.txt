 Previously on "Resurrection"... 
 Rachael? Can you hear me? 
 M-my baby. 
 Okay. We're gonna take care of you. 
 We call ourselves "The True Living ". We're just a group of concerned citizens... People who don't want to be victimized by the returned. 
 The virus is contagious, amongst the returned. We have a treatment. It's not a cure. But it suppresses symptoms. 
 Bellamy : They sent me back with medication. I want you to have it, to be in charge of distributing it. 
 A vaccine? 
 No, it delays the progress of the virus. And there's a limited supply. 
 I know about the bones under the factory, the fire. 
 Whatever you think you know, Agent Bellamy, is in the past. 
 It will stay in the past. 
 Those bones, they were victims of a fire at your family's factory. 
 They returned and were murdered. 
 And I know a great piece of property when I see one. And you need an investor, just give me a call. 
 That was Henry Langston, grandpa. He wants to meet. 
 [Wind blowing] 
 [Child laughing] 
 [Crow cawing] 
 [Laughter continues] 
 Hey! 
 Little girl? 
 [Laughter continues] 
 [Banging] 
 [Man coughing] 
 [Gasps] [Banging continues] 
 Help us! Please! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Who are you? 
 Rachael. 
 I'm Margaret. 
 Are they going to die? 
 Some of them. 
 You're pregnant. 
 Yes. 
 That must be a very special baby. 
 Help! Help! Open up! Can't breathe! 
 [ Shouting continues ] 
 Help! 
 [Gasps] 
 Nurse : It's okay. 
 You were dreaming. 
 [Panting] 
 It felt so real. 
 You're still running a temperature. 
 Try to get some sleep. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Floorboard creaks] 
 Jacob. 
 I couldn't sleep. 
 I just had the most vivid dream. 
 Do you know someone named Rachael? 
 ♪ 
 What... did they leave already? 
 I told you I don't want you having those meetings here anymore, Ray. 
 I told you it wasn't a meeting. 
 It was just a group of my friends, and we were sitting down and just having a talk... 
 Okay, enough! 
 There were too many. 
 I kicked them out like 10 minutes ago. 
 Well, I'll catch up to them. 
 Hey, watch it, dumbass. 
 Hey! That's my brother. You apologize, or I cut you off. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, Ray. 
 Here, sit down. 
 I'll buy you one. 
 No, I'm supposed to be meeting some friends. 
 What? One drink. 
 Do I stink or something? Come on. 
 Sit. 
 I'll get you a round. 
 What's going on, Carl? 
 What's going on? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 The entire town is infested with dead people, like some sort of a disease, so... 
 There's that. 
 How many you think there are? 
 What? 
 You work for the sheriff. 
 We counted 48 still in town. 
 Have any more come back since the mass return? 
 I don't know. A couple, maybe... 
 I think. 
 What if there's another surge? 
 Surge? 
 People are saying the government knows when they're coming back. 
 They're saying that... they don't want to tell us to prevent a panic. 
 By this time next year... 
 There'll be more of them than there are of us. 
 What? Who? W-who's telling you all this? 
 You should meet these friends of mine. 
 They know all about this stuff. 
 They got some solutions to it, too. 
 Solutions? 
 I-I can't say too much about it in here but... 
 I'll let you know about the next meeting. 
 You can hear what they have to say. 
 I think you'll like them. 
 Okay. Sure. Whatever, Ray. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Yeah? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Um... I called the hospital to check up on Rachael. 
 And...? 
 She's been running a fever above 102 for almost three days now. 
 So, if Mike Enders is any indication, she'll have less than two days left. 
 So give her the meds. 
 I don't know what it is. I don't know what it does. 
 And giving untested medicine to a pregnant woman violates everything I was taught as a Doctor. 
 If you're looking for answers, I don't have any. 
 I just know the stuff works. 
 How? 
 Did you actually see this at the government facility? 
 Is that it?  
 No, no, not exactly. 
 Then how do you know that it works? 
 Just trust me! 
 I'm not the one you have to convince. 
 [Sighs] 
 What? 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] 
 We're good together. Aren't we? 
 It's okay. 
 I know you're worried about Rachael. 
 I am, too. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 It's Maggie. 
 Hello? 
 I want to emphasize this medication is not a cure. 
 But as long at you take it, it will relieve the symptoms and prevent the worst from happening. 
 What about the baby? Is it safe for him? 
 We don't know. 
 But without the medication... 
 There's a very good chance this is terminal. 
 So there's really no choice. 
 What is it, Rachael? 
 I... I-it's just a lot to take in. 
 What's a lot to take in? 
 Rachael, if you don't take the medication... 
 I'd like to be alone now, please.  
 We don't know how long... 
 Tom? 
 Okay, Rachael, we can come back in an hour or so. 
 Give you a moment to process all of this. 
 That sounds good. 
 Sure. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Footsteps] 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? You've been praying? 
 Mostly worrying. 
 It's been almost an hour. 
 It's hard to understand why she's taking so long to make a decision. 
 [Sighs] 
 Why is that so hard to understand? 
 Look. I know she's pregnant. 
 And I know how you feel about that. 
 But if Rachael's in danger... 
 Oh, it's not about that, Tom. 
 It's about faith. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, you can't make her take the medication. 
 You can only have trust that she'll make the right decision. 
 I don't accept that. She can be convinced. 
 And what if you convince her? 
 And what if something happens to the baby? 
 [Sighs] 
 I may not know how it feels to be a mother... 
 Janine...  
 But I can imagine. 
 And you should, too. 
 I'm trying. 
 God wants us to have this baby. 
 Wants us? 
 We'll need to send in a surveyor, but I wouldn't be surprised if we found some structural damage, uh, particularly right here in the eastern elevation. 
 Yeah, but that's, uh... that's repairable, though, right? 
 Uh, everything can be fixed, Henry. 
 I'm just warning you that sometimes with a development like this, it's cheaper and easier to raze it to the ground and start over. 
 Uh, no, no. 
 [Sighs] 
 No, the bricks and mortar are important. They're a part of the history. 
 Then we'll make it work. But it's gonna cost. 
 How much? 
 Start-up costs to attract other investors? 
 Ballpark. 
 All right, well, uh, it's close to a million and change. 
 That's... that's a lot of money. 
 Well, as joint investors, that's $500,000 each. 
 I just want you to be aware of what we're talking about. 
 I mean, if it's not a possibility, then let's not waste each other's time... 
 No, it's not impossible. 
 Good morning.  
 Oh. 
 What are you doing back so soon? 
 I thought I'd introduce myself. 
 I'm Margaret Langston. 
 Henry's... 
 Cousin. 
 Uh, Brian Addison. 
 And... and you're not really his cousin, are you? 
 [All sigh] 
 I-I-it's okay. I know what's been going on in Arcadia. 
 I know there's a lot of unbelievers, but I'm not one of them. 
 And I've been doing my research on the Langstons. 
 I've seen pictures of you. 
 You're Henry's mother, right? That Margaret Langston? 
 Guilty as charged. 
 You know Arcadia well, Mr. Addison? 
 Uh, well, I spent some time here as a boy. 
 Still have some family in the area. 
 I'm not familiar with the name. 
 Oh, well, we're not as renowned as the Langstons, that's for sure. 
 How much do you know about running a factory? 
 Ma, we're not interviewing Brian for a job. 
 No, no, no. It's all right, Henry. 
 I have nothing to hide. 
 As for my knowledge about the manufacturing industry... 
 Well, I admit I know nothing.  I'm an investor. 
 The business side of affairs, I expect the two of you to bring to the table. 
 Well, nobody knows more about running that factory than we do. 
 When I came back and saw what had become of the place, it broke my heart. 
 Well, look, I am absolutely sure that between the three of us, we are gonna get Langston furniture back to its former glories. 
 Jacob, get down from there. 
 Come on. 
 [Sighs] 
 What happened to our car? 
 Which one? 
 The green one, with the wood on the side. 
 Which? 
 The station wagon. 
 Right. 
 They don't make them like that anymore. 
 Well, why not? 
 Well, fashions change. 
 And we have to be conscious of the environment. 
 But I liked our car. 
 Well... 
 How did the meeting go? 
 It's good. It's interesting. 
 I'll tell you all the details later. 
 How you doing, sport? 
 Can I watch TV? 
 Yes. Half an hour, no more. 
 [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 They seem to be getting along quite well. 
 What do you mean? 
 Is he married? 
 He didn't mention a wife. 
 What are you two talking about? 
 Brian's invited me to dinner tonight. 
 Dinner? 
 It's strictly business. 
 He wants to learn more about the factory. 
 Strictly business. 
 [Man clears throat] 
 [Coughs] 
 My name is, uh, Carl... Enders. 
 Uh, deputy Carl, some of you may know me as. 
 Uh... 
 My brother Mikey... 
 He died. 
 And he just popped back up with all the others. 
 I hated him. 
 [Sniffs] 
 I hated him when he was alive, and I hated him coming back even more. 
 Um... 
 He was a big man. And he was a cruel man. 
 He ran over a dog once and didn't even look back. 
 Anyway, uh... 
 I couldn't take it anymore. 
 It was like he was sent back to punish me, uh... 
 But I didn't deserve that. It wasn't right. 
 The way he treated me all my life, like I was some kind of a bug that he could just step on. 
 So I, uh... 
 Uh... 
 What did you do, Carl? 
 Hey. It's okay. 
 Hey, this is a safe place, Carl. 
 Nobody judges you here. 
 [Men murmuring] 
 Man : We're with you. 
 Go on. 
 I killed him. 
 [Murmuring continues] 
 Hush. Quiet. 
 Look at me, Carl. 
 You're wrong. 
 You didn't kill anybody. 
 You can't kill somebody that's already dead. 
 He wasn't human. 
 Right? 
 Right. 
 Right?! He wasn't real, Carl. 
 This ain't no miracle.  
 Kill him again if you have to. 
 I would. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Them being back is not a blessing. 
 I mean, things were all good before. 
 They didn't need to change! 
 Right! 
 Uh-huh. 
 And we don't need them here. 
 None of them! 
 I just want this town back the way that it was! 
 Uh-huh. 
 Yeah! 
 [ Applause ] 
 Hi. 
 The nurse said you wanted to see me? 
 Sit. 
 You okay? 
 You need anything? 
 I'm okay. 
 Feeling a little better, actually. 
 I asked you here because I've made up my mind, and I wanted to tell you first. 
 I'm not taking the medication. 
 Well, I've tried, but I'm sorry. I don't accept that. 
 Tom... 
 No, Rachael, no. 
 It's my decision. 
 And you're doing it all over again! 
 Doing what, Tom? What are you suggesting? 
 I'm trying to kill myself? 
 I don't understand what there is to think about, Rachael. 
 The drugs will keep you here. Isn't that the important thing? 
 If they keep me here at the cost of my child... 
 There will be nothing here for me. 
 Rachael... 
 It's okay. Really. 
 I had a dream last night. 
 It was like no other dream I've ever had in my life. 
 I'm not sure I understood it, but I was a part of something. 
 Maybe it's just the pregnancy, but... 
 The dream was scary. 
 But at the same time, it was... 
 Strangely reassuring. 
 I've thought this through very carefully. 
 I'm not taking the medication, not today, not ever. 
 Rachael... see sense. 
 I lost you once. I can't do it again. 
 I have a wife. 
 I love her. I do. She's... 
 But, Rachael... 
 Whatever happens, you have to know... 
 I know. 
 I'm at peace with this. 
 And you should be, too. 
 Because if I go away, it's what was meant to happen. 
 It's what's meant... 
 Rachael. Rachael? 
 Nurse?! Nurse! I need a nurse here! 
 Appreciate you.  
 Thank you. 
 We got your back, Carl. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Well, Ray... 
 Ray? 
 Oh. Oh, God, Ray! 
 Somebody help me! 
 Yeah. 
 All right. Thanks. 
 Just let me know if anything changes, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 Tom. I just got off the phone with Doctor Bassett. 
 How's she doing? 
 She's still unconscious. But she's stable. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I wanted to, uh, stay with her, but, you know, I can't just sit around and do nothing. 
 Oh, I know. 
 I wish there was something I could do. 
 You know, there is. 
 [Clears throat] 
 What? 
 There  is  something you can do. You can give her the drugs, Maggie. 
 Dr. Bassett said Rachael told you she doesn't want the medicine. 
 Do you think she should take it? 
 That's not the point. Come on, Maggie. Come on. Take off your Doctor hat for one minute, okay? 
 As a human being, as a friend of Rachael's you know I can't do that. 
 It's her decision. 
 It's my baby! Don't I have any say in this? 
 No. Unfortunately, you don't. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 [Knock on door] 
 Maggie? It's Ray Richards. He's showing symptoms of the virus. 
 What? 
 He's in the examination room.  
 But he's not a... 
 No. He's not. 
 Elaine : Maggie! 
 Your dad called. 
 Where is he? 
 Yeah, I'm going to see him now, okay? 
 What happened? Is he okay? 
 I don't know. 
 I have to go see him, okay? 
 Elaine. 
 Sweetheart, it's not... 
 What happened? 
 It's gonna be fine. 
 I'll be right back, okay? 
 Is it the virus? 
 The symptoms are identical. 
 Fred : How? 
 You said the rest of us couldn't catch it. 
 That's what they told me. 
 Oh, really? 
 You care to share what else they told you? 
 Hey, dad? 
 Hey, I'm the sheriff, Maggie. 
 I think I have a right to know what the hell's going on in my own town. 
 Look, I'm just as surprised as you. 
 I don't think they knew this was possible. 
 Okay, Marty, these drugs that they gave you, what do you know about them? 
 Only what I told you. 
 Can I give a shot to Ray? 
 Is it safe if he's not a returned? 
 I'll call them right now. 
 How worried should we be? 
 If we can all get it... 
 Very worried. 
 That's not possible. 
 Bellamy :  No? 
 Your Doctor said this thing kept mutating, and that's why you were having trouble with a vaccine. 
 Now, what if it mutated into something that can infect the living? 
 You still there? 
 How many?  
 So far, just the one. 
 His name is Ray Richards. These drugs you gave me, is it okay to... No, under no  circumstances should you give that medication to a living patient. Why not? It's been tested. Their immune systems are different. You could have mentioned that before. Well, before, it wasn't a problem. Sit tight. I'll get back to you. Hey, Tom, wait up. I can't just sit around and do nothing, Marty. I understand. My wife's telling me to have faith. Have faith in what? The whole world's going to hell. You want to do something. You're damn right I want to do something. Now other people are getting sick. I mean, somebody's got to do something! I have my own supply. Of the drugs. What? I have it... the virus. So I take these drugs every 12 hours. And they work, Tom. I'm completely symptom free. Please, Marty, we have to do this. We have to give those drugs to Rachael. How we survived the depression era is nothing short of a miracle. I was only a little girl, but I could see that everything changed, virtually overnight. My father was a foreman for Edward Langston. They couldn't run that place without him, and they knew it. 1963, he died on the factory floor. He grabbed his chest and lay down in a pile of sawdust. Well, I can see why you care about the factory so much. Family businesses are virtually a thing of the past. When your name is branded on every sale, you make sure it's a thing of quality. Is that why you ended up marrying a Langston? Business and family in perfect harmony? I got Warren, the eldest. I was 17, and he was 38. I went from being a child without a care in the world to scrubbing laundry and watering down his whiskey to stop him getting sad. So, an arranged marriage? I married the man I was told to marry. But you learned to love him, right? Eventually? No. He wasn't a bad man. Lazy, as most entitled people are. But you could never really say that was his fault. I gave him two sons, an heir and a spare, and everyone was happy. Eventually, his drinking got so out of control that I ran the business. He was content. Oh, listen to me, going on and on. [Chuckles] Am I boring you? Oh, no, no, no. I-I want to know more. Well, what more can I tell you about the factory? No, no. I mean about you. Tell me. Well, I'm not very interesting. I think you are. [Indistinct conversations] Hey. I just checked in on her. Any change? No. I'm sorry. Did you need something from me? No. Tom, uh, wanted some company. I offered to come with him.  Oh. Okay, well, I just got called back to the clinic, but we'll check in later. Okay. Okay. [Sighs] Maggie : Lily, I'm on my way. Well, tell Mr. Nathey his hemorrhoids can wait 5 minutes. Oh, damn it. Make it 10. I think I left my keys in Rachael's room. Even if this works, she has to keep taking it. We're still gonna have to talk her into it. Let me worry about that. Here. It's on me. Whatever happens is my responsibility. Maggie : What are you doing? What are you doing?  Maggie... Give it to me. Give it to me! Now leave before I call security. We can't just stand by and do nothing. Do you even know if this would work... At this stage? Do you? For all we know, this could hurt her more. Yes, he does know. He knows it works. Tell her. Tell me what? Tell me what? It does work, Maggie. How? How are you so sure? Because... It doesn't matter. It's okay, Tom.  No. It's not. Maggie's right. It's not what she wanted. [Door opens] Hey. I need to tell you something. Where did you get the drugs? I have my own supply. W-why do you need your own s... Because... I'm returned. So, you had a family here in the '30s? A sister, and you all... Sorry. Sorry. This is... It's a lot to take in. I should have never tried that with Rachael. It was wrong. I know that. She and I, after everything we've been through... I couldn't just let her slip away again. Chicago. You said you found out back in Chicago. That was over a week ago. Why didn't you tell me then? It was personal. You told Tom. Tom was different. Why? I didn't know how you'd react. [Scoffs] You didn't trust me. No. You're putting words in my mouth. If you trust me, then why are you always hiding things from me? First, it was the bones, and now it's this. You keep lying to me, Marty. So, how can I trust  you? [Cellphone vibrating] Okay, I have to get back to the clinic. Maggie, wait. We need to talk about this. No. No. Apparently, we don't. We're all waiting for you. We know you'll make it, and God is taking care of you. We can't wait to meet you. [Indistinct conversations] Okay, Carl, you good? All right! Hey, if we can get a little quiet in here, please? Carl, the floor is yours. Thanks, Joey. As you all know, these people that have been coming back... Whoever or whatever they are... Are getting sick. Yeah, they are. Lots of them, by some kind of virus that they brought into town. Same one that did in my brother Mikey... God bless his miserable soul. Now, they've told us that we can't catch it. Lies.  They've told us that we're safe to mix with these people. It's not right. But it turns out they were wrong. Because just this afternoon, our friend Ray Richards came down with this same virus. [All murmuring] Now, I don't know what all this means, and I don't know what's gonna happen with poor, old Ray, but I do know this... this ain't right. No. No, it's not. And just them being here, they're gonna get us all sick unless we protect ourselves. And I say we take action tonight! Yeah! I'm with you! Yes! [All shouting] Yeah?! Hell yeah! Yeah! You need to come back upstairs. What happened? The drugs? Well, we didn't need them. I came back to check on her, and she was like this. All her vitals are normal. We took blood to run some tests. But how? I don't know. I want to go home. I know. Tomorrow, okay? We just want to observe you for one more night, okay? Okay. [Chuckles] It's incredible. It's a miracle. This is your cousin's house, did you say? Yeah. Yeah, he's out of town. He's letting me use it for a while. Here, just a small one. Then I'll get the coffee on. Oh, just the coffee, thank you. Okay. Well, uh, make yourself at home. Help us! Please! Hey. You're leaving? It's getting late.  Did I do something wrong? Oh, absolutely not. Um, I've had a lovely evening. I just remembered I promised I'd tuck my grandson in. Thank you. Good night. Why would you bring her here? I, uh... if she realizes who I am, none of this works! Grandpa, look. She was a little girl at the time. She doesn't remember you. You better hope not. You could have blown this whole damn thing. hi. Hey. [Sighs] Oh. They've got him in that room. I can't get to him. He'll be terrified when he wakes up. Oh, I'm sure they're just being cautious. How did Ray get sick? He didn't mix with the returned. He avoided them. Maggie once told me that they don't even know exactly how influenza spreads. They don't know much, do they? Guess not. Thanks for the candy bar. Mm. Hell, if one more person gets sick... Screw the government. I'm gonna shut down this whole damn town. [Ringing] Woman :  At the tone, please leave a message. Whatever he's drinking. Okay. Hey. Hey. Thought I earned one. I still haven't heard from my contact. Well, I have some good news. Rachael... she's conscious. They're running tests on her blood, but I think she's over the virus. Without the medication? That's how it looks. Thank you. You know, you could have told me. And what... burden you? No, I could have helped you... If you'd just let me in. I didn't want it to define me. It doesn't. I died, Maggie. We all have issues. [Both laugh] Please, just no more talk of death. Can we drink our beer instead? It's you. Rachael. Rachael Braidwood? I asked after you.  They told me  you were here... That you had the virus. I'm better now. I'm pleased to hear that. I wanted to meet you, to make sure you were real. The dream, the factory. It wasn't a dream. Then what... it was a memory... For me, at least. The young girl... that was you. There was a man in the fire. I keep thinking about him. I can still... feel him. So can I. I think he's back, like we are. He's angry. He is. I've been keeping a journal. I just want to document this incredible time in our lives. We are so lucky. We have a home. We have each other. Rachael and the baby are safe. I told you. All we needed was faith. Janine... Right. [Indistinct conversation] Who would do something like this?
