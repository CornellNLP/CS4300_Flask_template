 My name is Roman. Ten years ago, our ship crash-landed on Earth. We came here seeking refuge, but the Humans thought that it was an invasion. That night, I met a Human girl who tried to protect me a girl I never thought I'd see again. The surviving members of my race, the Atrians, were rounded up and isolated inside a militarized sector. 
 Now it's 2024. 
 Seven of us have been chosen to attend high school as a part of a government integration program. But the Humans and Atrians continue to distrust each other, while I fight to protect my people and the Human girl who saved my life at any cost. 
 Previously on Star-Crossed 
 When my mom returned to the Sector, they wanted her to build something called the Suvek. 
 The Suvek? 
 That means "blast" or "flash." 
 You think it's some kind of bomb? 
 It's called the Iksen's Key. 
 We need it to operate the Suvek. 
 Grenade that almost killed me was the same kind of grenade Castor gave us to destroy black cyper. 
 He's got to have a whole stash of them somewhere. 
 If we can find his stash, we can use it to blow up the Suvek. 
 Castor pays for what he has done! Tonight! Come with me. 
 It was wise to build the Suvek to survive attack. 
 In a few days, we introduce it to the world. 
 What are those Trags doing? - Can you see what's inside? - No, but they're definitely up to something. 
 If we can beat them to that catwalk, we'll get a clearer view. 
 The Suvek? How did it survive the explosion? Where are they taking it? Go, go. 
 They're gone? We lost them! I'm guessing my mom built the Suvek to withstand the attack. 
 There's a reason why Vega went to great lengths to get her released from the Crate. 
 She's the best engineer in the Sector. 
 Everyone's planning for Mardi Gras. 
 Meanwhile the Trags have a doomsday device. 
 How are we gonna get rid of it? Why don't we go to the Hwatab? Tell them what we know about Vega and the Suvek? We don't have proof. 
 We know they're hiding it in Quadrant D somewhere, but that's it. 
 I know we can't trust the cops with this. 
 But there's got to be someone that we can call on for help that'll believe us. 
 Actually, there is someone. 
 But you're not gonna like it. 
 No, Drake! We can't do this. 
 The Trags could use the Suvek and start a war anytime. 
 You got a better idea? Can you give us a minute? - I'm not going anywhere. 
 Yeah. 
 Anything you need to say to me, you can say to her. 
 Yeah, Drake. 
 Didn't you hear? Emery's a Red Hawk now. 
 That's not true. 
 What is this about? You've been leaning on me for weeks about information on the Trags. 
 I think I got something for you. 
 I'm listening. 
 The Trags built a weapon. 
 Something called a Suvek. 
 We think it's some kind of a bomb. 
 A bomb? - We tried to destroy it. 
 It didn't work. 
 So, why are you telling me this? Because we got a plan B. 
 We're gonna steal the Suvek from the Trags. 
 We need your help. 
 Why don't you tell the SEU? - The SEU is a leaky ship. 
 They have informants on the inside. 
 It's true. 
 When I was a Trag, Vega always knew ahead of time - when the SEU staged a raid. 
 Besides, they'd end up holding all Atrians accountable. 
 Kiss integration good-bye. 
 Unless, of course, that's what you and your Red Hawks really want. 
 No, what I want is to go back to the part where you said you were a Trag. 
 Now, I'm sorry, but How do I know that this isn't some Trag plot? Stop it. 
 I'm no more a Red Hawk than Roman and Drake are Trags. 
 And Grayson doesn't want to end the integration program. 
 If you'd all just take the testosterone down a notch, you'd see that we all want the same thing here, right? Assuming we actually get our hands on this thing, what are we gonna do with it? We take it to Gloria. 
 She's the only government official that we trust to make sure that the Trags are the only Atrians sent to the Crate. 
 Have you even thought about how we're gonna get it out of the Sector? I've got an idea. 
 But we're gonna need help. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You want us to do what? We're gonna smuggle the Suvek outside using the Mardi Gras unity float. 
 I got Gloria to give us permission to finish building the float inside the Sector tomorrow. 
 She's always looking for new ways to promote the integration program, so she's using it as a PR opportunity. 
 Well, nothing says unity like trying to dismantle a Atrian terrorist plot together. 
 I knew the Trags were vicious, but I never thought they'd go this far. 
 Think of it this way if we fail and the Trags detonate that thing, a whole lot of people are gonna end up dead. 
 And now this "Sumac" thing and the Trags detonate thais gonna wipe us all out? Why aren't we going to the police about this? Suvek. 
 And even if the police believe us, there'll be all kinds of Atrian backlash not just the Trags. 
 How many people know about this? - Just the six of us. 
 It's safest that way. 
 Yeah, so don't go phoning your Red Hawk pals. 
 Okay, first thing we need to do is figure out where the Trags are keeping it. 
 They got a new hideout. 
 We find that, we find the Suvek. 
 Can't we just ask Teri or Saroya? Nobody has seen or heard from Teri in days. 
 Besides we don't know where her loyalties lie anymore. 
 Isn't there anyone in the SEU that we can trust? Afraid not. 
 But we think we might have a way to use their shadiness to our advantage. 
 After we find the Suvek. 
 Show them the map. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 All right, this is what we're thinking. 
 The float's gonna be entering The whole reason we broke up was so I could deal with my people and the Trags alone, without having to worry about your safety. 
 And now Grayson is pulling you back into this. 
 Okay, I made the decision to do this, not Grayson. 
 You have to accept the fact that he's not - who you think he is. 
 For ten years, he's been told that my people are a threat. 
 An abomination. 
 You can't tell me that someone who grows up with parents like that is not affected by it. 
 I am telling you that. 
 We just spent the last three hours talking about Atrians who want to see me and everyone I care about splattered across Edendale. 
 Do you really think you have a leg to stand on here? Emery, There are Atrians that are still angry that we were even together. 
 What are they gonna think when you come waltzing into the Sector with a Montrose? I'm doing this because people's lives are in danger. 
 And so that maybe, someday, hopefully, you and I can be together again. 
 I thought that's what you wanted, too. 
 Of course that's what I want. 
 I just need you to be safe. 
 Then you have to do whatever it takes to trust Grayson. 
 This is the only way this is gonna work. 
 Feeling better? Much stronger. 
 Thanks to you. 
 Did you have any trouble getting into my pod? The Hwatab posted a guard. 
 He'll have a headache in the morning. 
 Remind me never to get on your bad side. 
 A poison kos? I need to neutralize the Trags and overthrow the Hwatab. 
 They're both hunting me. 
 What's that? The legend is that this belonged to the Abor Atedi. 
 The first Iksen? The father of all Atrians. 
 It's gorgeous. 
 It's for you. 
 That is, if you will join me. 
 I want you wearing it by my side when I take back the Sector. 
 It's never looked more beautiful. 
 Were you able to connect with my followers? They asked me to give this to you. 
 It says that the Hwatab is on the verge of announcing Roman as the new Iksen. 
 I thought Roman was out of favor after his tryst with Emery? The council has chosen to support integration. 
 They want to capitalize on Roman's open-mindedness. 
 I know that you and Roman have a history together. 
 Roman was fun when I was younger. 
 But I've tired of him. 
 I crave someone stronger. 
 Wiser. 
 Someone who will open me up. 
 I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not a little girl anymore. 
 I think that you and I are gonna do great things together. 
 The krewe of students will be building the float today in preparation for the start of Mardi Gras festivities tomorrow. 
 The float is a symbol of the growing trust and peace between our two races. 
 All right, let 'em through! The Trags are finally in the Marketplace. 
 Are you sure you're ready for this? I am. 
 Are you? Whatever it takes. 
 That's what you said, right? Too bad we can't fight off the Trags with papier-mÃ¢chÃ©. 
 So how do we find this Suvek? Ever since the explosion, the Trags have been loading up on supplies. 
 They're restocking - their new base camp. 
 We know what quadrant it's in, we just don't know its exact location. 
 The good news is they have no idea that we're onto them. 
 I should be able to follow the Trags to the Marketplace without them suspecting. 
 They should lead us straight to it. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No, you'll be recognized. 
 It's way too dangerous. 
 You can't do this alone. 
 What if they catch you following them? Roman, she's right. 
 Locating the hideout only works if you make it back alive to tell us where it is. 
 I'll go with you. 
 I'm gonna talk to my mom. 
 She knows the Suvek better than anyone. 
 Gotta figure out how to safely get it outside the Sector. 
 What makes you think she's going to give up the details? I mean, she did build the thing. 
 She's no Trag, okay? Don't forget, we have to do all of this before curfew. 
 We should go. 
 Be ready to move the moment we get back. 
 You want to slow down? You shouldn't have come. 
 Humans in the Sector draw attention. 
 Especially ones whose parents are known terrorists. 
 I think you could use the help. 
 From what Emery's told me, the Trags make the Red Hawks look like the PTA. 
 Hey. 
 That's Sargas. 
 It's one of Vega's top soldiers. 
 That's who we follow. 
 How do you know he's gonna take us to the hideout, huh? He could just as easily take us grocery shopping. 
 In here, you follow my lead. 
 You got that? That's funny, I seem to remember some Atrians coming to my lunch table yesterday asking me for help. 
 Your boy's on the move. 
 Come on. 
 We're gonna lose him. 
 So how long have you known the Trags have been planning - this attack on Humans? - Keep it down! Knowing the Trags have a weapon against Humans is a pretty big secret to keep from people you claim to care about. 
 And by "people" you mean Emery? Look, man, I'm just trying to figure out what side you're on. 
 Here's a question for you: How long did you know your parents were leading a terrorist organization? - They lied to me. 
 You protected the Red Hawks even after they threatened my sister, and planned an attack on the Sector, so I got a pretty good idea of whose side you're on. 
 Looks like a pretty good place to hide a weapon. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go. 
 Emery, I think we found the hideout. 
 This should help bind the wound. 
 Good. 
 'Cause I have to act tonight if I have any hope of taking back control of the Sector. 
 Relax. 
 Your body's still healing. 
 If you move too quickly, it'll tear open. 
 You still have plenty of followers inside the Sector. 
 Roman cannot become Iksen. 
 I'm the only one with the vision to build a sovereign nation for our people. 
 What can I do to help? You have proven to me to be loyal, resourceful. 
 Give me something about the Trags that I can use. 
 The Trags are building a weapon. 
 Something they plan to use against the Humans. 
 I don't know much more than that. 
 Thanks for telling me that. 
 That I can use. 
 I just heard from Grayson. 
 They found the hideout. 
 Corridor D. 
 Through a green door three blocks east of the Market. 
 I should go. 
 We don't have much time. 
 Remember, they have to believe every word you say. 
 And be careful. 
 I thought Castor was the one who tried to blow up the Suvek. 
 We used his explosives, hoping to pin it on him. 
 I used panels from the ship to protect the Suvek, so Castor's grenades barely left a scratch. 
 Which is why I need your help. 
 We need to steal the Suvek and get it outside the Sector. 
 Have you not learned anything? Stay away from Vega! You've already put yourself in enough danger. 
 Just let it go. 
 Mom, please. 
 This is the only way to avoid war with the Humans. 
 You might think this is worth getting yourself killed over, but I don't! I want more for you. 
 And I want more for the both of us. 
 Outside these walls, there's a better life together. 
 Which is why we can't let Vega win. 
 I'm not gonna convince you to stop, am I? 
 No. 
 All right I'll help you. But the Suvek is complicated. If you want to know how to move it out of the Sector safely, you're gonna have to sit down and listen closely. 
 
 
 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Please, it's an emergency. 
 There's gonna be an attack. 
 What? The Trags built a bomb. 
 I don't know what they're planning, but I can tell you where to find it. 
 I need a response team, code nine. 
 I'm starting to think you don't know where we're going. 
 We've got to be up high enough so we can see which way the Trags move the Suvek. 
 Stay here. 
 I gotta take care of something. 
 What, are you serious? What could be more important? Teri! Where have you been these last few days? Last I checked, you aren't someone I owe explanations to. 
 This cuff, it's been in my family for generations. 
 The last time I saw it, Castor was wearing it. 
 And you're stockpiling herbs? Castor's injured. 
 The Trags have him, don't they? - Let me go. 
 Castor tried to kill me. 
 He's dangerous, Teri. 
 Don't you get that? You always expect the worst from me. 
 So nothing I do should really come as a shock to you. 
 Wait. 
 I care about what happens to you, more than you know. 
 I don't want to see you get hurt, but if you keep getting mixed up with my uncle, that's what will happen. 
 Vega, we got a tip. 
 The SEU's on their way. 
 Move it. 
 Now! If the plan worked, the Trags should be moving the Suvek any second. 
 Stay low. 
 Follow my lead. 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Hands where I can see 'em! Hands where I can see 'em! Can I help you gentlemen? There. 
 There! Call Emery. 
 That's got to be it. 
 Okay. 
 Got it. 
 It worked. 
 It's on the move. 
 There you go. 
 Come on, Drake. 
 There you go. 
 What are you doing? Why am I You left me no choice, Drake. 
 If I don't get to the Suvek If you try and steal the Suvek, the Trags will kill you. 
 We're trying to stop a war. 
 What part of that don't you understand? If you do this, you will start a war. 
 You're going to keep me tied up here while my friends risk their lives trying to steal that thing? It can't be done. 
 Do you hear me? Vega had me build in safeguards. 
 The second the Suvek passes out of the Sector, it will release an electrical pulse that will kill anyone within 30 feet. 
 Hey. 
 Wait. 
 Drake's not back yet. 
 It's too risky, trying to take the Suvek without backup. 
 We got one chance to do this. 
 I'm not letting it slip by because you're waiting on your boyfriend. 
 Is there a problem? - Yes, if you don't get your hands off me. 
 You need to keep it together. 
 And you need to get out of my face. 
 You've been on me ever since we got to the Sector. 
 I can't take a leak without you second-guessing me. 
 Well, what'd you expect, a welcome basket? Your Red Hawk parents tried to blow up the Sector! You know, you might have Emery believing that you have nothing to do with it, but I'm not buying it. 
 That's what this is about, isn't it? Emery? She left you and you can't handle it. 
 You say one more word What's the problem? Oh, that's right. 
 You don't like to remind your people that you went out with a Human. 
 No wonder she left you. 
 Once we get the Suvek loaded onto the float, I need you two to get the other students and bring them to the gates. 
 I'll pick up the boys and we'll meet you there. 
 Got it. 
 The sooner we get rid of this thing, the better. 
 You know, the longer you keep me here, the more danger my friends are in. 
 Your friends shouldn't have picked a fight they can't win. 
 Come on All we can do now is find a way to survive. 
 I'm friends with Weeble. 
 He told me about an old tunnel that leads out of the Sector. 
 It was blown open by the hurricane. 
 We can use it to escape to Eljida. 
 We can start a whole new life, w we can be free. 
 I lost you once. 
 And every day I was in the Crate, I swore I would never let that happen again. 
 Until you're a parent, you can't understand the pain of letting your child go of knowing there's a chance he could get hurt. 
 Mom, I need you to listen to me right now. 
 If anything happens to my friends because I wasn't there to help them, you will lose me. 
 For good. 
 Because I'll never be able to forgive you. 
 We always go back for our own. 
 You taught me that! As a warrior. 
 Doesn't that mean anything anymore? Go to your friends. 
 Before I change my mind. 
 The Suvek's security can only be disabled remotely. 
 I'll do it. 
 I'll send a signal when I'm done. 
 Thank you. 
 Come back to me. 
 I will. 
 I promise. 
 These are Trag phones. 
 Not just any Trag phones. 
 I've doctored them with messages about planning an attack against the Humans. 
 My followers will plant the phones in the pods of the Hwatab elders. 
 Their pods are the most secure in the Sector. 
 Even my mother can't get into them. 
 Your mother doesn't have this. 
 It's the Iksen's Key. 
 It can open any Atrian lock. 
 Once the phones are planted, I'll call Gloria and tell her that Vega and the Hwatab are working together, planning a strike against the Humans. 
 Gloria will order a raid. 
 She'll find the Suvek and the phones you planted. 
 And the Hwatab and my mother will be sent to the Crate. 
 How do you feel about that? My whole life I worked towards earning my mother's love. 
 Her trust. 
 Took me 16 years to realize she had none to give. 
 To her, I was just something to be used. 
 I hope I'm worth more than that to you. 
 I trusted you with my life. 
 What further proof do you need? Your plan to take down the Hwatab has one flaw. 
 My mother's Trags will be watching your followers. 
 She'll stop them before they make a move. 
 Let me plant the phones. 
 Let me prove my worth to you. 
 What about Roman? Are you sending him to the Crate, too? I have other plans for Roman. 
 Emery! Roman! The Suvek's in the back. 
 All right, let's go. 
 What the hell? We got a problem. 
 The Suvek has a safeguard. 
 The second it leaves the Sector, it's gonna send an electrical charge that'll kill anyone within 30 feet. 
 That's not our only problem. 
 My mother will signal when she'll disarm the Suvek defenses. 
 We gotta give her more time. 
 Whatever happens, don't let them near the Suvek. 
 Stay at the wheel. 
 Be ready to drive out of here the moment we get that signal. 
 Roman! Roman! Let him go! Emery! Call off your friends. 
 Or I put a hole in her head. 
 I was just checking the Suvek's security. 
 I heard there was a raid. 
 Let's see what Vega has to say. 
 Let's not. 
 That's the signal. 
 Emery! Go! Go! Okay Grab my hand. 
 We're watching live as the first Atrian-Human float emerges from the Sector So, I just got off the phone with Gloria. 
 I'm gonna meet her at the school in a half hour and give her the Suvek. 
 Hopefully, by tomorrow morning, the Trags will be on their way to the Crate. 
 Sorry about the punch. 
 It's okay. 
 I figure after what my parents did, we're even. 
 Hang on a sec. 
 Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? I'm driving a ten-foot mammoth head over a weapon of mass destruction. 
 It's probably best I go alone. 
 You and Roman managed to work together. 
 It could be the start of a beautiful friendship. 
 I don't think so. 
 There are just some things Roman and I will never see eye to eye on. 
 Right, um Well, you should get going. 
 Text me when you get there. 
 What are you gonna do tonight? You can't just go back into the Sector. 
 I'll be fine. 
 I know every hiding spot in there. 
 What about the Trags? Although, I would feel a little safer if you and your can of pepper spray were around. 
 Ha-ha-ha. 
 All I can think about is kissing you. 
 If we started, I wouldn't know how to stop. 
 We took down the Trags today. 
 We're one step closer to being together. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 It's Mardi Gras. 
 What are you doing here? I brought you a gift. 
 The Iksen's Key? It's operational? I tested it on our lock just to sure. 
 I didn't think you'd get it this quickly. 
 And Castor? Castor suspects nothing. 
 Now we can arm the Suvek. 
 And you, my daughter, have more than surpassed my expectations. 
 We have what we need from Castor. 
 You know what needs to be done. 
 What is it? Get out! What's wrong? The Suvek was stolen by Roman and his friends. 
 What are we gonna do? The game isn't over. 
 We have one more piece to play. 
 Hello, Roman. 
 You have to know how much it pains me to do this, but, Roman, you and I could've ruled the Sector together. 
 But you had to ruin everything. 
 I told you I would handle Roman. 
 He got away, but he can't escape the poison. 
 Are you upset? I'm only upset the effort reopened your wound. 
 Let me. 
 There. 
 All better. 
 I can't believe Weeble's tunnel worked. 
 The SEU does sweeps here all the time. 
 It'll probably be boarded up by the morning. 
 Mom, you okay? It's been a long time since I was free. 
 Let's get moving. 
 Mom, wait. 
 I kept my promise. 
 I came back. 
 But I can't go to Eljida with you. 
 I'm not leaving without you. 
 I get how you feel, which is why I hope you'll understand. 
 Her name is Taylor. 
 She's a Human. 
 And she's pregnant with my child. 
 I-I can't run away from that. 
 From her. 
 So So, I-I'll stay. 
 I'll help you and Taylor - figure out what to do. 
 You have a chance to be free now. 
 No, Drake. 
 You need to take it. 
 I can come and go, but you will always be trapped in the Sector, and you know I'm right. 
 And when things calm down, I'll come find you in Eljida. 
 But that's not gonna happen unless you leave tonight. 
 You were so small when they took you from me. 
 And now I I can't lose you again. 
 You won't. 
 I promise. 
 Stay with me, just a little while longer. 
 Touchdown! Or whatever. 
 Hello. 
 Roman, oh, my God. 
 What happened? How did you get here? I needed someplace safe. 
 All I could think of was this place. 
 I'm here. 
 Stay with me.
