 (indistinct radio chatter) 
 ROMAN: September 17 ,2014. 
 The day we arrived. (siren wailing) We fled a dying planet. Our ship crash-landed here. For my kind, it was meant to be a day of liberation. Refuge. But for everyone on Earth... it was an invasion. (people shouting) Shh. The humans left us no choice but to defend ourselves. (electrical whooshing) Incoming! (screaming) (gunfire, explosions) Vuní! (shouting, gunfire continues) Roman: I did as my father said. I ran as fast as my legs would carry me, not understanding what I was running from. And less sure what I was running to. (gunfire continues in distance) REPORTER: National Guardsmen continue to engage in a bloody conflict with the alien species,   whose ship crashed to Earth several miles from Baton Rouge. The President has issued a state of emergency. While officials report that some of the invaders NEWS ANCHOR: What do you think would be the alien plan? We should go to my mother's. The roads are closed. And plus, things aren't gonna be any better over there. Just try and relax. GIRL: What's wrong, Daddy? Nothing, baby. Everything's fine. Don't forget to take your medicine, Emery. Okay, Daddy. REPORTER: Just getting word; NASA astronomers have speculated that the trajectory of the spacecraft originated from a distan olar system called Atria. Regardless of where they came from, local residents and world leaders... (distant thumping) (dog barking outside) (door thumping) (helicopter whirring) (door creaks) Hello? Hello? (quiet clatter) Emery: It's okay. It's okay. You're one of them, aren't you? (shivering) Emery: I'll be right back. (door closes) (helicopter blades whirring) If, on the other hand, their goal was actual occupation and conquest, then they would probably have to prioritize anything... (door creaks open) EMERY: It's okay. You don't look like a monster. You can stay here tonight. I'll come see you in the morning. Be very quiet. (door creaks open) ("Human" by Civil Twilight playing) EMERY: It's good, isn't it? Here. Use the fork. This one's called star. Through here. Through the loop. Let go, it's a star. Here, you try. (dog barking outside) (helicopter approaches) (man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) MAN: Bravo unit one-seven... (dogs barking, man continues indistinctly) EMERY: We've got to hide you. Got to go. He's in here! (Emery screams) (dogs barking) Go, go, go, go, go! (gun powers up) Get away from her! Don't hurt him! Now! EMERY: No! (sounds distort and fade) ? (siren wailing) (indistinct radio chatter) ("Break the Walls" by Fitz and the Tantrums playing) (siren whoops) (siren wails) NEWSCASTER: It's been ten years since the alien species known as the Atrians arrived on Earth, and the U.S. military rounded them up and put them in a government facility where they remained in lockdown. Today, in a controversial effort to integrate them into society, seven Atrian teens will become student t Marshall High School. EMERY: Hey, Jules. Hey, Emery. Only you could pull off sweaty sexy at : a.m. Outside Marshall High, angry protesters demand that the Atrians remain sequestered inside their sector. Time to stretch. Come on. My former hospital buddy's now my personal trainer. You said you always wanted one. Yeah. Named Fernando. Or Tristan. With an accent and abs. These anti-integration advocates believe the Atrians may be hiding a greater plan to colonize Earth. WOMAN: If you ask me, this whole integration program is just a distraction from the real issue. Is this on every channel? Yep. That ship is casting a shadow over this whole town... All the loonies are out today. You got to love conspiracy theorists. One of them was claiming that the Atrians grow a medicinal herb inside their Sector called cyper. Can it cure conspiracy theorists? I'm just saying. Maybe you could get chummy with one of the Atrians. Get a batch. Fix up this whole hospital. MAN: What did I say? Keep these guys back. Oh, my God, it's your dad. REPORTER: As you can see, Commander Ray Whitehill of the Sector Enforcement Unit scans the wristbands of the Atrian Seven llowing authorities to track their location while at school. He's so lucky. He's, like, one of the few people who can actually say that they've been inside the Sector. EMERY: Of course only you would consider that lucky. So, you nervous about today? (sighs) Yeah. Sure. I mean, the guy on the news last night was saying how the eyes of the world would be on Marshall High. (chuckles) Leave it to you to start your first day back at school after four years in front of the eyes of the world. MAN: governments are putting pressure on our government. The media hasn't covered it thoroughly enough... I'm really glad you got better, Em. Thanks. Now it's your turn. REPORTER: The Atrian Seven are now headed to Marshall High, where protests continue to grow. (crowd clamoring) WOMAN: I speak for all my colleagues in D.C. when I say that after three years of ongoing discussion, we're very proud to se his program finally come to fruition. A program which, if successful, could lead to the integration of all Atrians into society. The hope is that we're not just able to peacefully coexist, but we also learn from one another. Their culture alone... Those Tatties belong with their own kind! Our kids were raised right. Get off of me. Get off of me! Tatties, go home! Come on, let's go around back. In the tech lab are code monkeys. It's kind of like this weird world dominated by chimps and orangutans or whatever... has no idea how to communicate with humans. And if you look discreetly to your two o'clock: Asian fashionistas. They never wear the same thing twice. And further up the stairs, to your two o'clock: on the second landing, are the Lenin worshipers. The Communist Lenin, not the Beatle. What's your first class? English lit? I hope you didn't get Mr. Turk. I mean, he'll make you read Atlas Shrugged. And let's just say that it is a total, utter downer. It's a downer, Em, and I'm so sure that you're not even listening to me. Em! Yes, I'm listening. You said it's a total and utter downer. Hey. They're here. ? (siren whoops) (bus horn blares) Get out of here! Go home! Go home! Go home! Everybody off. Everybody off. ? All right, follow me. Let's go. Move it. Line it up, single file, shoulder width. I want a line right here. Line it up. Form a line. Right here along. You. Right here. (students murmuring) I mean, could this day possibly get any more insane? I think it just did. MAN: All clear. Let's go. Move it. WOMAN: My name is Gloria. You don't know me, but I am well-acquainted with each of you. Yen ikedúr almatév ayá? [/i] Yes, Teri, I have been laid recently. And English is the language of choice here at Marshall High. I know you've been briefed on protocol and passed your MHS entrance exams, but I think it's necessary to set some ground rule or your own safety. I'm sure you've noticed increased security. We don't anticipate any violence, but the guards are here for your protection. And the Atrians. The guards have been authorized to use their temblor guns if you step out of line. You are only permitted to leave the Sector for school. Curfew still stands. Back in your pods by : p.m. every night. Behind the walls of this school, they're just like you. They're students. You're test subjects. At least for the time being. But one day, you could be graduating. Heading off to college or out in the work force. Imagine the possibilities if this program is a success. But it won't be easy. A lot of people are hoping you fail. They think your race has come here to destroy us. It's up to you to prove them wrong. ? Wish we were the kind of aliens who carried ray guns. Remember our first day at the Sector School? You guys hated it there, too. At least we didn't have to worry about temblor guns pointed at our heads. Or worse. Glee club. ROMAN: They tagged our lockers. (beep) (sighs) (beep) Right. You got to use your right hand. (beep) Yes. I swear I'm not usually this technologically inept. It's okay. You get a pass on your first day. Where you transferring from? Oh, nowhere. I've just been out. For the last four years. I transferred last year from Newhall. And I'm not on the welcoming committee or anything, but I know my way around, so if you need anything... Thanks. For the finger tip. I mean, for the tip for the locker. See you. Bye. (school bell ringing) DRAKE: I never thought I'd say this, but I'm already starting to miss our Sector School. Humans are savages, Roman, every single one of them. Right? Yeah. Right. STUDENTS: I pledge allegiance to the flag  of the United States of America, and to the republic, for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. TEACHER: All right. I'll be passing out your syllabus for the semester. Take one and pass it back. (quietly): Hey. Rumor is they have three penises. Small, medium and extra large. Yep. Taylor. Sweet girl, braces. Remember in middle school? Yeah, now she's in charge. In charge of what? All of it. Hey, have you heard of an herb the Atrians supposedly grow in the Sector? Something called "cyper"? It's, like, some miracle herb. LUKAS: Cyper? No. But if it's herbs you seek, some of the stoners probably have some in their lockers. (chuckles) (quietly): You eat our food, wear our clothes, breathe our air, but you can't be bothered to pledge our flag? We're not citizens. Oh, that's right. You're Martians. Well, technically, Martians are from Mars. We're from a far superior planet. What did you say to me, freak? Hey, that's enough! Atrians are not required to pledge to the flag. Cheer up. You get to keep liberty and justice all to yourself. TEACHER: Open up the fall semester calendar. We have some events coming up. MAN: Nox, you've been the Atrians' most vocal advocate for equal rights. Did you think this day would ever come? I never lost that hope. This program is the first step toward unifying our races. (siren whoops) And I couldn't be prouder that my own children are part of history in the making. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. MAN: It's the Atrian Seven! Let's go! (reporters murmuring) Hey. How did it go? Excellent. We've been far too insulated in the Sector from just how kind and compassionate these people can be. Your brother has mastered the earthly art of sarcasm with relative ease. Tell me about it. If I have any chance of making friends, I'm gonna have to distance myself from him. Why do you want to be friends with them? Humans are so much more colorful. I'm sorry. What about today was colorful? Was it the armed guards or the protestors? Or...? Oh, wait. I know. The human kids that hate us. They just don't know us yet. - Isí ipní kidón, ijén... NOX: Maia. English. You're there to learn, not to make friends. (sighs) ROMAN: Well, tomorrow's a new day. "Your daughter will tell you exactly why she's not devouring that shrimp lo mein." (gasps) (laughs) It's nothing. Mm-hmm. I just... was thinking a lot about that boy in the shed today. What about him? About how, if he hadn't tried to protect me, he'd still be alive. Not everyone can be saved, baby. Sometimes... there's a greater plan at work. AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Enjoy your meal. Good afternoon, Atrian. Your lunch option is puffed rice cake. Would you like chicken-flavored, beef or carrot? Enjoy your meal. Hey. It's Emery, right? You live over on Woodglen? Yeah. Let me see your phone. (beep) There's a party at this abandoned farmhouse. You should come. Can I bring Lukas? Sure, yeah, if you guys are, like, a package deal. We're friends. Oh, good. Because Grayson wasn't sure. Grayson... was... asking? I am relieving you of duties. Yes, yes, and you are just in time. So, what did that fembot want? How did you manage this, Em? She invited me. Or us. I think she's got a crush on you, Luke. That's cute, Em. That was real cute. Was that your material? 
 
 Great. (sighs): Okay. This is your club? Yeah. You go to local hospitals, spend time with patients, painting, scrapbooking hat sort of thing. Mm. I found it really comforting. You were in the club last year? No. I was a patient. I spent the last four years in the hospital because of an immune deficiency. Hmm. So, what did you prefer? The painting or the scrapbooking?  Uh... the scrapbooking. Oh. ROMAN: So anyone can join? EMERY: Uh... it's a lot of after-school hours, and with your curfew and not being permitted outside the Sector... I mean, your Sector without permission, I... No, I understand. I understand. ROMAN: My memories are stored on a separate computer anyway, so I probably wouldn't be good at scrapbooking. Joking. (laughs) Thanks anyway. You like talking to our girls there, Tattie? You think they're pretty? ROMAN: I was interested in joining her club, but she wouldn't have me. Oh, well. No, don't feel bad. ROMAN:(chuckles) It's just as well. I don't have an artistic bone in my body. Do you have any bones in your body? ROMAN: Good point. Our, uh, skeletal system is made up of , centipedes holding hands, but that's Atrian secret number . How do you know that? Everything okay, Roman? Yeah. We're just getting to know each other. ERIC: I don't care that your dad is some big Atrian honcho. You play by our rules here. Got it, freak? Come on... Teri. ROMAN:(whispers): Got it. (laughs): So, wait, they were pissed because you talked to an Atrian? I mean, I guess it sort of is everyone's worst nightmare. What is? The notion of the human-Atrian hookup. A "hookup." EMERY: Okay, we were talking about painting and scrapbooking. That's how it begins. EMERY: (laughs) I think we need to find you a new hobby, like glassblowing, maybe belly dancing. Something like... What are these? Discharge forms. EMERY: You're going home? For good? Yeah. Tuesday. EMERY: A... and you didn't tell me? (chuckles softly) Em... the chemo isn't working. And finding a bone marrow match could take years. EMERY: So, then why are you going home? I'm anemic. I'm getting pneumonia every other week. My platelet count keeps dropping. EMERY: Jules, you're not giving up. It's not about giving up. I don't even care about the poking and the prodding and the puking. What I can't take anymor s seeing my parents get their hopes up... only to have them dashed one lousy CBC test after another. EMERY: They'll let you out for an hour, right? (sniffles) Why? Where are we going? (sirens wailing) (man speaking indistinctly over speakers) And you're sure you know what this cyper herb looks like? Yes. Good. 'Cause my dad will kill me for stealing his access badge. (gate slams shut) (quiet chatter) ? ATRIAN WOMAN: Yen hembikil. Yen hembikil! Ah. Bracelets? Okay. I'll take three. Oh, no, thank you. Julia, no. No, thank you. What do we have here? You kids know you're not supposed to be here. Do you have any cyper? Cyper. Right here. Come on. Ipén asoryunú halá. [/i] (shouting in Atrian) (crowd gasping, clamoring) (alarm blaring) MAN (over speakers): Lockdown! Yaprasivíl! [/i] This Sector is now under lockdown! Come on, come on, come on! Let's go. Okay. Lockdown! ROMAN: We'll be safe up here. Jules, you okay? Are you kidding? (laughs): That was amazing. ROMAN: What are you guys doing here? Uh... we came for your cyper. ROMAN: Well, why didn't you just say so? I guess its curative powers are no longer just our secret. Come on. We smuggled some seeds into the Sector from our ship. What is this place? ROMAN: My dad and I built it. It's kind of like our own private sanctuary. Here it is. Wow. (laughs): Wow, there's so much of it! ROMAN: Take as much as you'd like. Is this really cyper? ROMAN:(sighs): Yep. It's really cyper. Or, as you call it, saffron. Saffron? Well, it's our own version of it. ROMAN: We use it for cooking. But some enterprising guards have made a good amount of cash selling our spice's magic remedy to... gullible humans outside the Sector. It was worth a shot. ROMAN: Do you... have a sick friend? Um, I don't. She does. ROMAN: Um, I'm sorry. Hey, this wasn't a total loss.  At least I got to see this place. I'm... obsessed with all things Atrian. (shudders) ROMAN: You're shivering. Here. EMERY: Thanks. So chivalrous. JULIA: Wow. City looks beautiful from up here. EMERY: How did you get that scar? ROMAN: It... it happened a long time ago. On Arrival Day. EMERY: That was you i... in the shed, wasn't it? You knew this whole time. How? ROMAN: (chuckles) The moment I saw you at school, I had this... bizarre craving for cold spaghetti. EMERY: But I was sure you were dead. I saw them carry you away. ROMAN: I came close. (chuckles) One of my hearts actually stopped beating for a few minutes. Luckily, I have a backup. I never got to thank you... for saving my life. EMERY: I... I was six. I hardly did anything. ROMAN: You were kind... when everyone else was cruel. That's something. MAN (over speakers): Curfew warning... (alarm blaring) ROMAN: Curfew starts in ten minutes; you guys should go. MAN (over speaker): Curfew warning: ten... I can't believe that was him, the boy from the shed. But, clearly, he's no longer just a boy. Julia... I'm sorry. Come on, you got to have a boyfriend back in the Sector, right? (laughs): No. There's nobody. Who knew an Atrian could be so sexy? You're the talk of the school. Mm. Oh, but don't tell your friend Teri, though, 'cause we think she might bite. (laughs) I should get to class. Where you going? Where you going? Hey, tell me something, is it true what they sa bout Tatties? Oh... Don't! Well, you're kind of a feisty one, aren't you? Stop it! Hey! Hey! Leave her alone. You just can't seem to get out of my way, can you? That's my sister. Oh. Okay. SOPHIA: Roman! (grunting) SOPHIA: Roman! Help! OFFICER: Get off him! Hey, get off him! Somebody help him! (officers shouting) Hey! Hey, break it up. Break it up. Get out of here! Go back to your own damn planet! Hey, get him the hell out of here! OFFICER: Write him up. Let's go. I've been watching you for a long time, Roman. I worked closely with your father to help build this program. Unless you want to see it fail, you have to stop acting like an animal. ROMAN: He assaulted my sister, and I'm the animal?  This happens again, they'll hand you over to military doctors to have your testicles put in a jar and studied. You don't want that. ROMAN: I don't want that. And my testicles definitely don't want that. I always protect my investments. That is, until they lose their viability. SOPHIA: Roman. GRAYSON: Hey. You're coming tonight, right? Yes, Grayson, you're gonna see her tonight. God. Attempt to be cool. Even social newbies like Emery still like a little cool with their drool. Uh... MAN (over speakers): Quadrant C cleared for inspection. DRAKE: Stay out of it, Teri. Even if you can get out to crash their lame party,  you'll never get back in time to make curfew. Maybe, maybe not. But we need to send a message, all right? What happened to Roman today can never happen again. High heels now? It's the beginning of the end. No, it's a party. You'll be careful? Always. Have fun. You deserve it. I'm out of here. Off to the Sector. Bye, Dad! Do you ever miss it? What? Atria? Of course. Every day. But... this is our home now. (scoffs) Armed guards, mandatory Curfew and barbed wire. It's not exactly my idea of home. It won't be like that forever. ROMAN: Dad, they're... (sighs) they're never gonna treat us like equals. You know, your generation can bridge the gap. A gap they created. I... I'm not saying it's gonna happen tomorrow. These things take time. But I have faith in them. Just like I have faith in you. You're not like the rest. I just don't see it. (door opens) We'll finish this planting tomorrow. What do you want, Teri? I saw you last night with that girl Emery. I was keeping her out of trouble. I don't know why you even bother making connections with them. Soon, they're gonna be the ones behind these walls. What are you talking about? Just something my mother and the rest of the Trags talk about in their Monday meeting. No offense, Teri, but your mother's an idiot. Oh, and by the way, Drake and them went after that kid Eric. MAN (over speaker): Lockdown, hours. Lockdown, hours. I'm looking for the path to Hades. Aren't you Nox's son? You must be confused. Can you help? (whirring, beeping) As I told your friends, you've got three hours before the signal reactivates. Zone B. Corridor . Look for the broken light. Directly beneath, there's a false panel. ("Justice" by Future People playing) GRAYSON: Okay. I had to strong-arm a freshman to get the last of the blue punch. Thanks. Cheers. Cheers. You all right? Yeah. Sure. You just seem a little distracted. (chuckles) This is all just... pretty new to me. Just try to relax. You're not being judged. Most people here are too self-obsessed to care about anyone else. TAYLOR: Hey! You guys got to see this! (crowd murmuring) Look what someone did to Brock! Who did this? Huh?! Who did this?! (moans) We just want to have a little talk. All right. This ends tonight. For once, we agree. Hey! (grunts) (groans) We're sick of it! You guys messing with us every day! It's done! It's over! This is what's gonna happen if you keep messing with us, you hear me?! (grunts): Hey! Come on! Roman, what are you doing here? Do you know what they'd do to you if they found you outside the Sector? You should be fighting alongside of me instead of against me! (sirens wailing) TAYLOR: Cops! Come on! (crowd shouting) (grunts) Roman. Roman! Ro...! Are you okay? Emery, come on! Come on! Roman, get in! Are you nuts? Come on, Emery, just leave him! But what about the cops?! ERIC: His problem, not ours! Come on! Emery, what are you doing? Let's go! Emery! Grayson, we got to go right now. EMERY: Roman, come on. We'll be faster on foot. We can't just leave her! Yes, we can, man! She's a total freak! Dude, she chose the Tattie over you. Own it. Come on! Let's go! (sirens wailing) (sirens wailing in distance) (both panting) ROMAN: Are you okay? EMERY: Other than having possibly just committed social suicide? Sure. You okay? (chuckles) ROMAN: You know, it's funny. All these years, my dad has taught me about this vaunted thing called "humanity," something that, by definition, we could never possess. But... after spending just a few days amongst your kind... this concept of "humanity" doesn't seem so clear to me. EMERY: No. There are a lot of good people out there. ROMAN: Yeah? Well, I've only met one. ("Human" by Civil Twilight playing) ROMAN: You don't have to be afraid. (phone ringing) EMERY: Sorry. It's my mom. Hey. I'll be home soon. O... okay. I'm on my way. It's... Julia. I have to go. ROMAN: I understand. EMERY: If you keep walking straight, you'll find the road to the Sector. ROMAN: Thanks. Hey. Are you okay? EMERY: I have to go. (monitor beeping steadily, air pumping) Teri. You were with Roman a few hours ago. Do you know where he is? It's almost curfew. Teri? (monitor beeping steadily) ? ? How could you let my son go out there? (grunting softly) (grunts) Is there a problem here, gentlemen? No, we're good. Step away from the table. Let me see your hands. Ooh. What's that? Not good, Weeble. (officers shouting) Drop your weapon! Weeble, no! (gunshot) (monitor flatlines) (monitor beeping steadily, air pumping) MAN (in distance): Man down! ? MAN: Commander Whitehill! Ray! Are you okay? ?
