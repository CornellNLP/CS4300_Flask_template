 3x03 -  "A Fixer of Sorts"[b] 
 You told me you stayed in Banshee because of me. 
 I had to make sure you were okay. 
 I'm not. 
 [sighs] 
 [door closes] Hey, listen. You don't seem surprised to have a gun in your face. That's a symptom of a life spent looking over your shoulder. Who are you? I'm Special Agent Robert Phillips, FBI Internal Investigations. I didn't realize the FBI had internal affairs. That's because you're not really a cop. But... we'll have plenty of time to talk about all that later. Why don't you get dressed? [sighs] There was a time when I was the one who would watch you sleep. You were such a beautiful child with so much promise. It was never my intention to disappoint you, Mother. [b]Leah You could never disappoint me. I just wish I could believe you were content. Who will love you, Kai? Who will you love? Mr. Proctor? I... I just wanted to make sure you're okay. Promise me after I am gone... that you will move Rebecca out of this house. It's not proper. It's not healthy. Promise me. I should never have left her. I should never have left her on the farm  with my father. It's okay. Kai : She needed me.  All those years, she needed... She still needs you. And you're here for her. [tapping filter] [whooshing in slow-mo] [groans] [chanting voices] Hi there. You know, they say a man's home is  a window into his mind. Yeah, I've heard that. Glock 17. 9 mil. Really? Yeah. Gets the job done. You should know some things about me. My superiors demand results, but they're not in the least concerned how I achieve them. So if I were you, I would exercise some... caution. And if I were you, I'd do the same. Agreed. Why don't you put those on? [handcuffs clicking] So you're Proctor's big bad watchdog. You don't look so tough from where I'm standing. So here's the plan. First, I'm gonna kill you. Then I'm going inside and I'm gonna slowly gut your boss and his "Little House on the Prairie" niece. I don't think so. [grunting] [air hisses] [grunts] [shouts] [grunting] Ah! Ah! [thumping] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [breathing heavily] [glass clinks] [groans] [groans] Ah! [screams] Nola. [gurgling] [gurgling] Nola : Let me die. Chayton : You already did. It's time to start living again. Sugar : What the hell is a data skimmer? Job : Exactly what it sounds like. It scans and saves metadata from encoded smart cards. We stealing real IDs from them so I can make fake IDs for us. That's all you had to say. That wasn't so hard, now, was it? Lord knows it ain't ever easy. This one's yours. Now, I want you to... [shouts] Testing! It works. [chuckles] Do your best not to f*ck this up. [grunts] [music] [radio chatter] [beeps] [sighs] [beeps] That is the third time this week. You think they're trying to tell me something? I need six IDs. Try not to move your lips while you're counting. Okay, I got to grab it. Job : Mm-mmm, three more. Running out of time. [keys clatter] One more. Oh, I had some keys... oh, there they are. One more. Sugar : Thank you. I got it. Get your ass out. I got a big business meeting and I can't get nowhere without these keys, you know? Thank you so much. [sighs] What? If we were never going past the lobby, why you got me wearing this damn suit? 'Cause there ain't no such thing as sweatpants Monday. You can drive. Sh... [country music playing] [mouthing lyrics] [humming] You know, I prefer classic rock, but something about country music that soothes the soul, don't you think? How did you find me? You know, I have a rather specialized job at the Bureau. I'm a fixer of sorts,  so I investigate dead and missing agents. Of course, the missing ones almost always turn out to be dead, too. Like Jim Racine? Instead I found his body outside an old farmhouse in upstate New York. Really? Well, what was left of him. He was burned up pretty bad. But not the slug that killed him. Glock 9 mil? No. .308 rifle round. Isn't that interesting? Not as interesting as the inch-thick file that he was keeping on you. You know, it turns out that the NYPD's  John Doe Capital Diamond thief  turned out to be the new sheriff of Banshee, Pennsylvania? That's quite a leap. Maybe, but the story gets better. Especially the part about the church, the gunfight. I mean, it takes some king-sized balls to take on a guy like Rabbit in a way like that. And when I think about an ex-con posing as a sheriff,  well, I think maybe those are the same big balls. Well, I'm flattered, but you're wasting your time. You know something about wasted time, don't you? I don't get it. I mean, you could have gone anywhere when you got out. You could have found a black sand beach somewhere in paradise, My God, that's what I would have done. Oh, not you. No. You came to Banshee. You played dress-up right down the road from the woman who stole 15 years of your life. She must be something. Or else there's something inside of you that still wants to be punished. What do you think? I think you talk too much. [chuckles] That's what my third ex-wife told me. Okay, get out. You're letting me go? No, I'm letting you take a piss. It's a long way back to the city. We're not gonna stop another time. I'm good. I'm not asking. Move. And if you try anything... Yeah, you'll shoot me. I get it. Yeah. Come on. Hey, you know what? I think I changed my mind. How's that? Well, I don't think I want to go back to New York. [chuckles] You make it sound like you have a choice. Well... there's always a choice. [gunshot] [electricity crackling] Olek : I want to report a robbery in progress at the Capital Diamond warehouse. 211 Saw Mill River Road. I'm Detective Julias Bonner. It was my team that took you down tonight. Congratulations. You are smart enough to know that whoever you're working for set you up. May I? [shivers] [breathing heavily] Woman : May I offer you something to drink while you wait? Coffee? Tea? Something stronger? [grunts] [door closes] Bonner : The way I see it, you know you got jail on the other side of this conversation. You aren't going home for many years. Time to wake up, asshole. Hey! There he is. [door slides open] [door closes] Sorry to keep you waiting. Hopefully my associates have made you feel at home. As you can see, comfort is a priority for a man of my dimensions. Some travel is unavoidable, but cars, vans, planes,  they all present indignities for me. Well, you could try eating a salad now and then. I think fat jokes are beneath us both. Well, that's hard to say seeing as I have no idea who the f*ck you are. [grunts] My name is Raymond Walton Brantley. Brantley, that's the guy you stole the money off, right? Look, I saw some sh1t I wasn't supposed to see. Brantley...  Brantley is a paranoid f*ck. Yes? No? Maybe? The only thing I know for sure about you  is who you are not. And you are not Lucas Hood. Isn't that right? It's okay. Despite a particularly nasty beating,  Agent Phillips here of the FBI's rat squad  remained as quiet as a mouse. Where is Jason Hood? I have no idea who that is. Really? Yes. No. Maybe. I... just... he's dead. He's dead. He's de... [groans] [groans, coughs] Brantley : Give me Jason Hood and Agent Phillips will never cause you discomfort again. To tell you the truth, I've never really been worried about Agent Phillips. So if you can find your dick in there,  why don't you go f*ck yourself? If I were you, I'd take a moment to consider how tenuous your bargaining position truly is. Bonner : Maybe you got a girl... [groans] alone in the dark waiting and wondering what happened. [footsteps] Tommy : I told you I should have handled Proctor's house. You'll get your chance soon enough. That's what you keep saying. Let me hit him where it hurts. Show Proctor that we're in control. You're not ready. Don't make me tell you again. Chayton. You guys take a walk. Hey, Tommy. I haven't been out this way since high school. You should not have come here. Why'd you steal those guns, Chayton? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were training an army. But that would be crazy, right? [chuckles] Crazy. Crazy is allowing the reservation to become as corrupt as the outside world. How many... But that's just what Longshadow and George Hunter have done. They call us outlaws, gangbangers. Treat us like we're the problem. Because you treat violence like it's the solution. I will do anything to protect our land from men like Proctor. All you're doing is hurting more of our own. This is bigger than any one person. Tell that to the dead Redbone they pulled out of Proctor's pool. Or the other one in the ICU. Casualties of a righteous war. You know, when we were kids and you and Tommy came to live with us... you were so shy. So gentle. I told everybody you were my real brother because I wanted it to be true. Now I barely recognize you. [chuckles] You sure can take a hell of a beating. I'll give you that. Why don't you just tell him the truth? He knows you're lying. He doesn't know sh1t. He thinks I'm lying. What's the difference? Come on, Agent Phillips, that's basic psy-ops protocol. The only way to overcome a physical advantage is to establish a psychological one. A psychological one. There you go. You remember. Yeah, I slept through that class at Quantico. No, you didn't. You know, you can play all the mind games you want, but we're not leaving here alive. You know that, right? Way I see it, I'm better off in here than I was in the back of your car. Well, if that's really true, you have to ask yourself just how f*cked up your universe really is. The thought has crossed my mind. You know, I have cracked some pretty twisted minds in my time, but you... You're not gonna give up on me, are you? Uh-uh. Not a chance. [laughs] [Brantley groans] Where were we? You just asked me about Jason Hood. And you told me to go f*ck myself. We're all caught up. 
 
 [electricity humming] I'm gonna f*cking kill you. [crackling] [groaning] Hey, Emily, it's me. Just checking in. Um... anyway, call me back, all right? Is everything okay? Couldn't be better. I'm... I'm clocking out. Any word from Hood? Nope. Nothing. I'm thinking we should turn his office into a game room. What do you think? [sighs] I'm actually pretty worried. I've been trying to reach him all day. Really? Well, your paperwork's not going anywhere. Why don't you head over to his place and see what's what? Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Brock. Sure. Let me know when you'll find him. All right. All right. You heading out? Yep. Anywhere good? No, just having an afternoon drink with an old friend. [music playing] Platinumm, what the hell was I thinking? Sorry. You know, there is worse things than getting some from your hot ex-wife. No, I know. There's always a flip side with her. You don't know Emily. I know there's nobody forcing you to bump uglies with her. That is true. That is very true. But, you know, it's... it's complicated. Ugh, how come every time a guy goes sticking his dick someplace he shouldn't, it's complicated? [sighs] Well, I just... No. You know, sometimes when I... Your ex knows exactly what she's doing. She's got you exactly where she wants you. Losing your f*cking mind over some bomb-ass pussy. I know. I know. I know. You already know what to do, but you're not gonna do it. You're a wise woman, Platinumm... [moans] [grunting] [electricity crackling] Hey, shithead! You kill him, you'll never get what you want. Agent Phillips is right. Are you gonna tell me where he is? [electricity crackling] [screams] Give him some fresh air! Sugar : Afternoon, Deputy. Can I get you something? No, thanks. Have you seen the sheriff? He missed his shift today. No. No, I haven't. But he'll turn up. He always does. You know him pretty well, huh? I could say the same about you. Could you? Mm. I'm not so sure. Sugar : Some people, you can know them  before you know about them. Maybe. Or maybe that'd sound a lot more profound if I had had a few beers. [chuckles] Yeah, I don't doubt that. Siobhan : All right, well, if you hear from him... Will do. Brantley : Now or never, mystery man. Where is Jason Hood? He's dead! He's f*cking dead. I told you. And why should I believe you? 'Cause I killed him, all right? 30 seconds. I doubt a word, you become roadkill. [ticking] The kid offered me 50 grand to take out your man in the fancy suit, all right? 25 up front, 25 when it was done. You killed Quentin? Well, it took some doing... but, yeah. Go on. So after I killed Quentin, Jason, he didn't want to pay up and he threatened to expose me. So you killed him and took the money? Fair is fair. Where is my money now? It's back in Banshee. All of it? Yes. And exactly how much is all of it? Brantley, he likes to deal with this sort of thing up close and personal. 62,000. I will take you back home. You will show me Jason Hood's body. You will return my money. What's going to stop you from shooting me the moment I do? You're not on the list. [whispers] Mmm. Seems I will be taking a trip South of the border after I retrieve my money. Sadly, Agent Phillips, your home is not on the itinerary. Wanda, tell Mr. Cole up front to pull over. My associates will escort you to your next destination. Where the hell is that? Safe travels, Agent Phillips. Let's go. [lock clicks] Brantley : Wanda, tell Mr. Cole to take us back to Banshee. The boys will catch up later. And mix me a drink. Bulleit Old Fashioned, extra sugar. Right away, Mr. Brantley. Bonner : You're going back into a cell. You're facing eight to 10 years. Life as you know it is over. [music playing] [men cheering] Hey! [gunshots] [people screaming] Get out of the way! [gunfire continues] Stay down. [gunfire] [women screaming] [keypad beeping] Get back! Down. Check the back rooms. Make sure everyone's out. Raven, hey, it's Brock. Look, I've got a 211 in progress at the Savoy. Looks like five assailants  and possibly two dozen civilians trapped inside. Hurry. [grunts] Get up. [groans] f*ck. [silenced gunshots] True gundog, Quentin. He could flush out the best of them. Tell me, how'd you beat him? No, I'm not telling you anything. Not until you tell me why you came so far  for an asshole like Jason Hood. I mean, a guy like you doesn't come all the way across the country for 60 grand. A guy like me would come across the country for 50 cents. [groans] Start digging. My body has failed me. I failed it. Either way. Things that you take for granted, I can't do. Simple trip to buy groceries or have a meal at a restaurant. I can't even f*ck anymore. But one thing I do have is my ledger. I keep my own books and I keep everything balanced. Not a decimal point out of place. The devil is in the details. And the details are all that a guy like me has. In that case, I bet you'd love to know what Jason Hood's last words were. Tell me what he said. He said to tell you... he'll see your fat ass real f*cking soon. [choking] [men shouting] [women screaming] Up here now. You, outta here! Get outta here! Move! [screams] Down now! [groans] [choking] [coughing] [shouts] [coughing] Stay here. [whimpering] What are you doing? No! [whimpering] [panting] You have it. Mr. Cole. Wanda, where are the shotgun shells? Cabinet, bottom right. Look away. Don't look at me. No. Everyone listen up. Listen up. We're not here to kill you. But when I'm done here... [gasps] .. you're all gonna have to find new jobs. Drop your weapons!  Hands in the air! Don't!  Don't you f*cking do it. Nobody move. I said to drop your weapons, fellas. [gasps] Son, that knife gets any closer to her neck, I'm gonna blow your f*ckin' head off. Ah! [women screaming] Ah! [gunshots] [groaning] Wanda. [footsteps approaching] [whimpers] [shotgun shell clatters] [gunfire] [screams] Sheriff's Department! Put down your guns right now. [gunfire] [panting] Ah! [panting] [music] Tommy! Tommy, it's Billy Raven. You and your boys need to surrender now and no one else gets hurt. No one except for you, cop. Damn it, Tommy! You need to listen to me. [gunshot] No! Ah! Alma, we need EMTs at the Savoy now. I'll clear the back rooms. Stay still. f*ck you! [spits] No, thanks. Don't f*cking move. [groans] Raven, you okay over there? Yeah. Raven : Knife! [gunshot] Where the f*ck is Hood? [whistling] That's deep enough. Turn around. [whistling] You don't want to do this. [whistling] Killing a federal agent will get you the needle. Good-bye. [pumps shotgun] [groans] [wings fluttering] I didn't kill Racine. I know. So what the f*ck are you doing here? I was curious. I was tasked to find a missing agent. You're not part of that story. The Bureau doesn't know anything about you. So what's stopping me from leaving you in this hole? You're doing a pretty shitty job of saving yourself. Seems we both need to work on that. Agreed. So we're good? Yeah. We're good. But you should know... I had to do something to cover my ass when I thought you would turn out to be who you weren't. What did you do? [music] Sorry. ♪ Stand ♪ ♪ On your land ♪ ♪ Play your hand ♪ ♪ Mark your man ♪ ♪ If ♪ ♪ The sun will rise ♪ ♪ He'll be dead... ♪ Bonner : We don't even know what to call you. ♪ You'll be alive... ♪ [vocalizing] What is it? What? God verdammt! Your life, that life, is over. ♪ Baby, I've been waiting here ♪ ♪ I've been waiting here so long for you to come around ♪ ♪ Now you made me say it, I ain't gonna stand for this ♪ ♪ You're never gonna get a chance to put me down ♪ ♪ Oh, there is a devil ♪ ♪ At your door... ♪ [motorcycle approaches] Lucas : I work alone. Bonner : No, you don't. You had someone in that building with you. And you two weren't performing some remote hack on some of the most advanced security systems on the market while rappelling from the roof, so by my count, that adds up to three guys not counting Mr. Rabbit. Lucas : What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit? Yes, I do. Yes, I do! Give me Rabbit! Give him to me and I'll cut you a deal. Maybe you get 18 months. You'll be out after a year. I would offer you witness protection, but you don't have an identity, so my guess is that you won't need a new one. Who the hell are you? Bonner : The way I see it, you know you got jail on the other side of this conversation. I used your prints to pull your file. There isn't one. We don't even know what to call you. You're a ghost. Life as you know it is over. You aren't going home for many years. You're going back into a cell and tomorrow at this time, you'll be in Rikers awaiting trial. Come on, this case has Rabbit written all over it. Lucas : What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit? Bonner : Give me Rabbit! Give him to me and I'll cut you a deal! [Lucas sighs] Okay. Bonner : This is for the record. State your name. Lucas : John Smith. Bonner : [sighs] What are you doing? Are you f*cking with me? Lucas : No, you're f*cking with me. Bonner : The deal is real.  You said you wanted to take the deal, you stupid m*therf*cker. [Lucas laughs] Maybe, but I'm not gonna sit here and do your f*ckin' job for you. Bonner : It's your funeral, asshole. [Native American chanting]
