 Previously on Banshee... all eight of the former hostages are alive. 
 A local police deputy intervened So I'm sure that you can understand that your involvement in the casino is now an impossibility. I'm a silent partner, as you like to point out. Max?! ( coughing ) His asthma is being complicated by that scarred lung. You'll always have a home here. Thank you. Sure. You can have nothing to do with him. ( roars ) I did love you. ( squelches ) Ah! ( wood breaks ) Ah! Ana. Open your eyes. Come on. ( traffic blaring ) Lucas :  Ana, look at me. You're gonna be fine. Ana, listen to me. You're going to the hospital. You're gonna be fine. Just hold on, baby. I need some help here! Help! I need help! What happened to her? She was attacked. We got a puncture wound here. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. She's bleeding out. Call up to surgery. Tell them we're coming now. Is she gonna be okay? How long has she been bleeding like this? Uh, I don't know. How long? Half an hour. She's crashing. All right, let's bag her and move. ( theme music playing ) ♪ Banshee 1x09 ♪ 
Always the Cowboy 
Original Air Date on March 8, 2013 ♪ My wife was brought in-- Carrie Hopewell. I'm so sorry, Mr. Hopewell. The doctor will give me an update as soon as-- Gordon :  You can't tell me anything else? Not at this time. I'm sorry. All right, thanks. She's in surgery. They said that you brought her in. What the hell happened? I don't know. She was attacked. Attacked? By who? Where? I don't know. You don't know who. You don't know where. What exactly do you know? Hey, hey, take it easy. You just happened to be the one who found her. Listen, she was outside The Forge. Okay? That's where I live. Yeah, I know where you live. I'm not an idiot, Hood. Whatever she's caught up in has got something to do with you-- the sh1t that's gone on since you've been here. If she doesn't make it-- She's gonna make it. Shut up. Granger :  Mr. Hopewell. I'm Dr. Granger. Your wife is stable. She's lost a good deal of blood and she was bleeding internally,  but there doesn't seem to be any major organ damage. We normally have to report injuries on this scale to the police, but-- I've already called it in. Where is she? She's in post-op now. We'll get her moved to her room in about an hour. Thanks. Hood. This is not over. ( sighs ) Sweet Jesus. What, you've never seen a dead body before? No, I just never had you pegged as a slumlord. Would it kill you to slap a coat of paint on this place? Maybe get you rattan furniture, a nice throw rug. ( exhales ) I remember you, ( grunts ) m*therf*cker. Hi. Out for a swim? It's beautiful out here. I hope you don't mind. I found it in the closet. No. Not at all. ( door opens ) She gonna make it? Yeah. Yeah, it looks that way. I never should have left her with him. Not for nothing, but she put a lot of holes in that Ukrainian m*therf*cker. Dude was leaking all over the place. Are you just going to stand there or are you going to pour me a drink? I'm all out of them little umbrellas. f*ck you, Sugar Daddy. We just buried a body together. We tight now. ( taps bar ) ( scoffs ) Sugar :  That bad? Rabbit? End of days, man. So what are you gonna do? What you should do, what we both should do is get the f*ck out of Dodge. I can't. I can't. I brought him here. I led him straight to her. So then what do we do? You don't do anything. You stay as far away from me as possible. Hey, now wait-- Hey, I mean it. Both of you. And you? I'm gonna kill him. I always meant to. ( rain pattering, thunder rumbling ) ( thunder crashes ) ( chuckles ) Olek... ( speaking Ukrainian ) Let's go. ( screams ) ( gasps ) ( monitor beeping ) Who are you? What time is it? It's not important right now. Just tell me. It's around 11:30. What day? Jesus. What day is it? It's Monday. The kids. Max is in school. I let Deva have the day off after everything that she's been through. We have to get them. You're in no condition to go anywhere. Carrie, cut it out. I know how this must seem to you and I'm sorry for all of it, but you have to trust me right now. Hey, baby, that is a pretty tall order right now. We're all in danger. You hit your head. You're not thinking straight. Listen to me. We have to get the kids and get out of Banshee right now. Come on. You're bleeding, Carrie. I'm fine. Just drive. I'll get Deva and be out in a minute. Hey, what are you doing? I'm going to get Max. You're in no shape to drive. ( tires squealing ) ( knock on door ) Yeah? Hood, I need you to take a look at my report on that school business and then sign off on it  when you get a chance. There. What? You shot and killed two guys,  got Xavier breathing down your neck,  and you better believe that this report is gonna be read as high up as he can take it. If I was you, I'd want to read every word. I trust you. ( car horns honking ) ( car horn honking ) ( breathing heavily ) ( heart beating ) ( heartbeat stops ) One thing about our people, they raise you to respect your elders. Something the rest of the world seems to have forgotten. I bought you something. Really? Thank you. Why don't you try it on after you've eaten? I'd like you to come with me to a meeting today. What for? I need someone I can trust. You trust Burton, don't you? I do, completely. But Burton is limited. You, on the other hand, are not. ( woman humming ) ( humming continues ) ( stops humming ) Mrs. Hopewell. You're awake. How long was I out? Just a couple of minutes would be my guess. You know you're in a hospital gown? Yeah. I changed your bandage. You were bleeding through. This is the first time I've ever treated one of the parents. Oh, I don't think you should be standing just yet. I've called for an ambulance. Thank you. Mrs. Hopewell, I really think you should wait for the ambulance. Mrs. Hopewell! ( children playing ) Mrs. Hopewell? Miss Lyman, hi. Are you okay? Yeah. I need to get Max. He's at recess now. You're bleeding. No, that's from before. Listen, I'm sorry to barge in like this. I'm just gonna get Max and go. ( heart beating ) No. No, no. Max! No! Max! Wait-- Mrs. Hopewell. No, get away from him. He's gonna take him. Help me. What? What's going on? He's gonna take him. ( grunts ) Max! Max! Max! ( groans ) Max! Where's Max? Max. My baby. Max! Max! Help me. Help me! ( pen scribbling ) Okay, so I just need to be clear on this. You went to the school before Max was abducted. His teacher said you saw him sitting on a bench. So you knew he was in danger. I knew he would come for him. Who? Who came for him? You can't help me. Carrie, you have to let us try. Every second counts here. ( police radio chatter ) Hey. What, are you done at the school? Yeah, the FBI took it over. Excuse me. Yeah, I just heard from Xavier. They're gonna be here any minute. Okay. Why is she not in the hospital? Brock :  She raised holy hell when they tried to take her. It's the only thing she'd agree to do. Sorry. I wasn't in time. It's all my fault. She's in shock. We need to get her back to the hospital. They're telling me she never even checked out. I'm not going back to the hospital. It's okay, Deputy. I'll take it from here. It just doesn't add up. Yeah, just give me a few minutes with her. Thank you. You okay? It was Rabbit. He was right there on the playground. Hey, hey, hey, hey. He's not gonna hurt him. He's not gonna hurt Max. You don't know that. He's using him as bait to get to you and me. That's what he wants. He's gonna kill all of us. He's not gonna kill anyone. You have no idea what he will or will not do! I won't let anything happen to your family. I promise. I'll find Rabbit. You don't have to. He's already found you. Emmett, will you keep an eye on Deva for me? Sure, Gordon. I mean it. Do not let her out of your sight. Understood. I want to talk to my wife alone. Get the f*ck out! Gordon :  Who has our son, Carrie? Carrie :  My father. Your father? You mean the one that died when you were 13? That father? Yes. Jesus Christ. Sheriff Hood. What the hell happened to her? Mrs. Hopewell-- she was attacked yesterday. And now they've grabbed her son. And she was the one who was assaulted by those bikers a few weeks ago, wasn't she? Yes. Has it occurred to anyone else here that Mrs. Hopewell is far and away the unluckiest woman in the state of Pennsylvania? Obviously she's mixed up in something. You think? Did she get a look at whoever took the boy? She may have. She's still very upset. But the teacher, she saw an older man in a dark suit. All right, I want a sketch artist here within the hour. And if they can't get anyone local, get somebody on a goddamn chopper from Quantico. Do you have anything else for me? We're just getting into it. Yeah. 
 
 Deputies, could I have your attention, please? As of right now, this is officially a federal investigation. You will all brief Agents Carlson and McAvoy on any interviews that you've conducted thus far as well as any and all evidence gathered at the scene. I've got a team on the way here from DC, but until they arrive, you will be assisting us with the legwork. This is a felony kidnapping. It is federal by a mile, so do not f*ck with me. Until the boy is sleeping in his bed again, everyone in this room works for me. Do you understand? Okay. I'm gonna go in and talk to the mother now. ( tools buzzing, hammering ) As you can see, we haven't wasted any time getting to work. At our current pace, we're looking at a grand opening a month ahead of schedule. And my people are working closely with the gaming commission to ensure that our licensing is in order by then. Afternoon, gentlemen. I hope you like what you see. Excuse me a minute. Proctor. This is coming up nicely. And ahead of schedule. Oh, let me introduce my niece. This is Rebecca Bowman. She'll be sitting in, learning the business. And this is Alex Longshadow. Sorry, this is Chief Alex Longshadow. He is the leader of the Kinaho tribal council. What are you doing here, Proctor? I thought you said you had a meeting. Oh, we do. It's just that Alex here forgot to mention to me that he was bringing in a new round of potential investors for our project. I don't take that personally. It's just there's a give-and-take in every partnership. We're not partners. I don't know how to make that any more clear to you than I already have. Now I'm gonna ask you one last time to stay out of the tribe's business and then I'm going to stop being polite. Listen to his tone. Look at his posture. How certain he is he is the one with all the power here. Get out now. Your father and I had a deal, Alex. You didn't like it, I know that. But you inherited it just like you inherited all this. Now the smart thing for you to do-- no, the only thing for you to do is to honor that deal. ( chuckles ) If you continue to think you can break your father's promises, you may cause me to rethink my own terms. You know what this is? It's a whistle. It's a lesson in power. ( blows ) ( air horn blows ) ( construction stops ) Let's go. We're done. Very nice to meet you. That was fun. That was a waste of our time. I need those workers working. Then why did you do it? Because I promised his father I wouldn't kill him. ( coughing, wheezing ) ( inhales ) Hey, Max. You are okay? Just let me go home. I want to see my mom. Hey. You don't have to be scared of me. I would never hurt you. I just want to go home. ( coughing ) What is it? What's wrong? I can't breathe. I need my nebulizer. ( coughing ) Just calm down. Take a deep breath. I can't. I have asthma. ( coughing ) ( door opens, closes ) Door was unlocked. No it wasn't. I, uh... I need your help. You want my help? Yeah. First I have to ask you something. The Amish girl, Rebecca-- did you f*ck her? What's that got to do with anything? She's my niece. ( sighs ) Small f*cking towns. So that's a yes. Yeah, I didn't know she-- ( grunts ) Hang on. I said hang on. ( groans ) ( both groaning ) You had enough? ( spits ) ( machine humming ) ( shouts ) ( Lucas panting ) ( Kai groans ) I think I've had enough. ( panting ) Good. So what did you want to talk about? There's some men in town. They came here for me. Seems to me I'd be better off letting these men have what they came for. No. You're too smart for that. Why's that? Because I'll owe you one. Huh. One thing. Rebecca-- she's off-limits. Deal. It's not a deal. It's a fact. ♪ Was I too dumb to notice ♪ 
♪ The pale light in your eyes? ♪ 
♪ Was I too distracted? ♪ 
♪ Did I turn away? ♪ 
♪ I can't exactly say... ♪ So how long have you had that stuff buried in our backyard? There's things you don't know about me, Gordon. I'm sorry. Things from my past. Yeah, but you were holding that gun today. Gordon, I love you... but I can't do this now. Max needs me. Is anything about us true? About you? Is Carrie even your real name? Not now. sh1t. Ah, here she is. ( Deva gasps ) I bet you didn't know your mother could handle a gun, did you? She was just about your age when I taught her. Go upstairs, baby. No. Stay here. Leave her out of this. Put the gun down. ( speaks Ukrainian ) Deva, how old are you? I'm 15. 15. Please don't. Who are you? I'm your grandfather. My grandfather is dead. No. Not yet. Deva. Is this him? Dad! Carrie :  Gordon, no! Gordon! You tell me where my son is, you son of a bitch. Your son is missing for five hours and you are angry and terrified. My daughter was gone for 15 years. Get Deva out of here. Gordon. Gordon. If you shoot him, his men will slit Max's throat. ( Deva gasps ) Carrie :  No! Is that any way to greet your father-in-law, Gordon? Please. Please don't hurt my father. This is not your father. Please, don't. Okay. Please, can we all just sit down? Like a family. Um, my brother Max-- All in good time. Your mother has told you many lies, Deva. And I think maybe she lied  to your stepfather, too. I don't know. Look, you see? Look at her face. It's true. Mom? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Deva, your brother has a breathing machine. His nebulizer. Yes. Go get it for me, please. Is he having attacks? He could die. Then you'd better hurry. ( speaking Ukrainian ) Anastasia. Where is Olek? Let me come with you. I can take care of him. You're such a sweet girl. I will see you again. ( chuckles ) Hey. I'm gonna kill you. You already have. ( car leaves ) ( slot machines chiming ) ( door opens, closes ) Alex :  Jeffrey Thompson. Yeah? You're a big f*cking guy with a big f*cking gambling problem. Rick knows I'm good for the money. Rick works for me and it's not his call. That money belongs to the Kinaho tribe and it's my job to safeguard that money. Do you understand? Yeah. You're into us for 46 grand. Yeah, I know. I made some calls. Ours is not the only casino you play in. You're into Fox Valley for 60 grand. Those guys are some tough bastards. I don't see how that's any concern of yours. It's not, but we have a working relationship. See, we do each other favors. I could wipe your slate clean. And why would you want to do that? You used to work for Kai Proctor, right? Yeah. What happened? Let's just say we parted ways. I heard he fired you. Just when you were paying off your debt, too. All right, look, you know you have me and I know you have me. So just tell me what the plan is. ( laughs ) I like where your head's at, Jeffrey. You look like sh1t. Long day. You know, sometimes you spend so long waiting for something, it simply can't measure up to your expectations. So maybe you should just go home, huh? ( chuckles ) So you're a pretend policeman now? Inspired, but stupid. This was always the way with you-- always in the moment, blind to the consequences. You'd make a terrible chess player. Is this your plan? To insult me to death? You spent all those years locked up with animals. Then you come here only to find she's married  with a family. Where's the boy, Rabbit? You can't help him. You're gonna kill a little boy? Is that gonna satisfy you? That's not your concern anymore. Are you going to shoot me or what? I'm considering it. Well, decide quickly. No? Okay. What do you want, Rabbit? I just wanted to look into your eyes for the last time. To be the last face you ever saw. Good-bye. ( guns cocking ) Oh, sh1t. ( music playing ) ♪ How come the sun still warms my face? ♪
