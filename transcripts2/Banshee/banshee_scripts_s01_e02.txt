 Previously on Banshee. 
 I know, you are the most notorious thief in the country. 
 And you're going to the one place, you should not go. 
 I'm not Ann anymore. 
 Give me my cut, you'll never see me again. 
 I don't have the diamonds. 
 Kai Proctor. 
 There's a name. 
 There's not a criminal enterprise around here that doesn't start or end in his pocket. 
 My name is Lucas Hood, I'm being sworn in as the new Sheriff. 
 Am I dead? 
 Yeah. 
 Hello. 
 Sheriff Hood? 
 Yeah, this is Hood. 
 Proctor! 
 Dutchie m*therf*cker! 
 ( barking ) 
 Hey, hey! Stick to the trees. 
 ( helicopter whirring ) 
 Officer :  Right there on the ground! 
 ( siren wailing ) 
 Run! 
 Carrie :  Baby! 
 ( panting ) 
 ( panting ) 
 I think he knows. 
 No, he doesn't know. He can't. 
 By the time he figures out we're not coming back, we'll be long gone. 
 Hey. 
 We risk our lives every time we steal for him. 
 Why not risk our lives for us? 
 No one's ever stolen from Rabbit. 
 He doesn't know. 
 Everything will be fine. 
 ( theme music playing ) 
 Are we back on track, Mr. Hanson? 
 We're still playing catch-up after that power failure yesterday, but I'll keep them late and we should be caught up by Sunday. 
 Friday. 
 Okay. Friday. I'm on it. 
 Oh, I'm on it, m*therf*cker. 
 ( music playing on radio ) 
 ( distant dog barking ) 
 ( exhales ) Get down here. You know for a fact the Yoders are out of town? Yeah. Away till Tuesday. Okay. Get out of here. Good to go, boys. All right. Carrie :  It's an original masonry house. All the houses in this neighborhood came up in the late 1920s. If you wanted to paint over this green in here. But I'll be here... Excuse me just a moment. Mrs. Hopewell, good morning. What are you doing here? Same as everyone else. I'm looking to put down roots. This room has great morning light. Would you like to see the kitchen? Sure. What the f*ck are you doing? You've been training. What the f*ck are you doing? This is my life. Ana. My name is Carrie. Either way, I still love you. If that's true, then you'll leave here and never come back. ( phone ringing ) Woman :  Carrie? Um, your phone. sh1t! Okay. Hello? Nice kitchen. Mrs. Hopewell, this is Principal Merrick. I'm calling to let you know that Deva is not in school again this morning. I wanted to check if she was feeling ill. No, no, she's not, but I can assure you she's going to be. I hope she's okay. Please let us know. Thanks. ( dialing ) ( ringing ) Hey, it's Deva. Leave a message. Or don't. ( Beeps ) Deva, where are you? ( screaming ) ♪ You're so, so fine ♪ 
♪ Even when you're dropping, you're down like a man ♪ 
♪ I know you're just a boy, but I could hardly tell ♪ 
♪ And no one really cares. ♪ Whoo! ( music playing inside ) Man :  How's it going? ( bubbling ) Man :  Yo, man. Are we putting the Skulls with these? Man #2 :  Just sort it and show me. Reed? ( gasps ) Hey, Hanson. Hey, Reed. Who the f*ck are they? It's okay. They're cool. Move. Well, come here, cool girls. ( chuckles ) Go on. ( bubbling ) ( coughing ) ( laughs ) ( thunder rumbling ) Arno :  You ask and Arno delivers. The Red Skull stamp as promised. ( laughs ) Pretty sweet, huh? Now if we can just settle up our account... Hey. Ah! Ow, man! Hey, fuckhead, you got high while you're working for me? Are you f*cking crazy? No way, man. I'm a professional. Hanson :  So you're not tripping right now? I'm straight, man. Look at me. ( grunts ) f*cking tweaker. Get him out of here. Move it. ( Groaning ) f*ck you, m*therf*cker! I'm gonna kick your ass. f*ck you. Yo, chill out, man. Get off of me. Man :  f*ck off! Go! ( Arno grunting ) Come here. ( thunder rumbling ) Come here. ( cap pops ) ( gasps ) Are you cool? ( door opens ) What is it? Some of the pills aren't pure. There's caffeine in them. You know what? How about you leave the chemistry to me and just go back and make the f*cking pills? What's going on? You're in. Midnight tomorrow at Yoder's barn. You know it? Yeah. And you girls will spread the word, right? Hells yeah, we will. Let's go, Deva. Hey. Sheriff. You're late. What, do I need a note from home? Couldn't reach you on your radio. I'm here now. What do you need? What I need, what we need, is a sheriff that answers his radio. All right? I'll take that under advisement. Look, I don't know how you did things in Oregon... Shut up, Brock. What? What the hell did you just say to me? I won't tell you twice. Mr. Proctor. Kai :  There he is. That looks painful. I'll survive. May I have a word in private? Kobe steaks. My best. Thank you. Well, you saved my life. I was just doing my job. I'm sure by now you've gleaned that there are people  in Banshee, our young mayor among them, who would have been happy to see me go down. Yeah, why is that? Oh... some people find my business practices a little aggressive. I don't deny it. Not everyone shares my vision for this town. But that's a talk for another time. The reason I stopped in is to warn you about the Moody brothers. Warn me? Yeah, they might be swimming in the shallow end of the gene pool, but they're a fiercely loyal clan. Been in this town almost as long as my people. And they will be out for blood. I'll keep my eye out. Sheriff, I wouldn't be bothering you if I didn't think you have a serious problem on your hands. I don't deny your abilities. It's just that your hands are tied by this office, whereas I have a talent for resolving problems like this one quietly. I appreciate your concern, but... I think I'll just take things as they come. It could be that I'm speaking globally here, Sheriff, beyond the Moody situation. You see, I've got a good number of local business interests that need to be kept running smoothly. These interests can occasionally generate difficulties, but they also generate revenues. Significant revenues. What do you want, Mr. Proctor? I might ask you the same question, Sheriff Hood. I'm good. But thank you. You take care of that. It could go bad pretty fast. ( waves crashing ) ( ring tone playing ) ( gulls screeching ) ( ring tone continues ) Where's my f*cking money? Lucas :  You'll get it. Where'd you land? In hell. Do you have any idea what I'm surrounded by? Skee-fucking-Ball, cotton-fucking-candy, and sea-fucking-gulls. Is that a cape? This is Diane von Furstenberg, chica. Shoo. Go get pregnant. So? Bitch, you got lucky on this one. Lucas Hood had virtually no living relatives, an estranged ex-wife and son he ain't seen in years. I couldn't even find any close friends. And he ain't into the grid, neither. No Facebook, no Twitter. Your cover is good for now. Except... Except what? Except that being where you are makes you the dumbest bitch that I know! Oh, not you, Snooki. So, how's she look? She looks good. ( grunts ) Hold it! ( Shouts ) Sorry, it's been that kind of week. You okay? Yeah. Then let's have some fun. ( grunting ) You and your Hula Poppers. If you're after serious game, you'd better come ready. Live bait is the way to go. Nah. I've been winning fishing derbies since you were a speck of sperm. I hear you have the new sheriff living over your garage. Huh? Seems kind of strange for an ex-con renting to a lawman. Doesn't it bother you? Apparently not as much as it bothers you. At some point, I might begin to question your loyalty. No, I'm just a broken-down ex-con. I don't choose sides. Kai. You talk about serious game? Hood is serious game. Like you've never seen. So if you come for him, you'd better come ready. Take care of yourself, Sugar. Yeah, you, too. ( jukebox playing ) No, no, no. You can't be here tonight. And yet I am. Cole Moody's wake. His brothers are drunker than usual,  if that's possible. Now, we've already had two fistfights. That's just between family members. Can I at least get a sandwich? Hey. All right. All right, just... Whatever it takes to get you out of here. Look, here. Come on, take 'em. Come on, eat 'em. Plenty more where that came from. Come on. All right? ( sighs ) ( Door opens ) ( door closes ) Sheriff Hood. Yeah? You don't know who I am, do you? Not yet. I'm Kat Moody. You killed my husband. And now you're sitting here eating food prepared for his wake, food that I paid for. Well, I apologize about the food. That was in bad taste. But not for killing my husband? ( chuckles ) He smashed me in the head with a pipe and then fired a gun at a crowded party. So, while I am sorry for your grief... He laid a good one on you. He did. You're the second woman to hit me today. I bet that's a slow day for you. Mmm. ( Gun cocks ) Kat :  Jesus Christ. Marcus, Dex, put those away. Shut up, Kat, and get inside. You Moody boys sure do like your six-shooters. You got permits for those? You won't be around long enough to find out. You're not gonna shoot a man at your brother's wake. What the hell is wrong with you? We're doing this for Cole. Cole was a mean drunk and he got what was coming. You watch your mouth, bitch. I'll kill you, too. Hey, you're Marcus, right? And you're Dex? That's right. Okay, Marcus, Dex, you have the right to remain silent. That's far enough. Anything you do say can be used against you in a court of law. You believe the balls on this guy? He thinks he's arresting us. You have the right to an attorney. Shut the f*ck up. Why don't you make me? Come on. Marcus, Dex, your coffee is getting cold. This don't concern you, Sugar. All the same, I am concerned. Come on. Hmm? If you can't afford an attorney, the court will appoint one for you, and he'll probably suck. Sheriff Hood, they're drunk and they're morons, but they're grieving in their own way. Get the f*ck out of here. Go on. This isn't over, Hood. We'll be looking out for you. Well, I'll be the one in the car with the flashing lights. ( laughs ) What the f*ck are you looking at? And you are? ( moaning ) ( phone vibrating ) ( helicopter whirling ) ( panting ) ( dogs barking ) Let's go. Hey, stick to the trees for at least two miles. You'll be fine. What are you talking about? Where are you going? I'm gonna throw them off. No, I'm not leaving you! Listen to me. You were right about Rabbit. He knew. He knew. Don't do this. Don't do this. Don't do this. We can make it. Hey, hey! I'll catch up to you. I love you. I love you. ( siren wailing ) Take the diamonds. I'll catch up to you. 
 
 ( Police radio chatter ) Go! Officer :  Right there! No! I got you! Stay right where you are. Officer #2 :  Get down on the ground right now. Right there. Hands up. Don't do it... ( Grunting ) Come on. ( helicopter whirring ) Officer : Copy. We got him. Baby! Hey. You okay, baby? Yeah. Just a bad dream. ( police radio chatter ) ( train horn blaring ) Is that the Moody report? Yeah. It's supposed to be. But if I had known there was all this paperwork, I never would have shot him. Aw, come on, you must have had to do this back in Oregon. Uh, yeah, I wasn't any better at it then. You filled out the incident report twice. And you have to attach it to the SO sheet. SO? State oversight. Have you already done the weapons discharge form? Uh, you know, Sheriff Morgan used to have Alma do all this stuff for him. She enjoys it. Just buy her a nice bottle of wine. Look it over when she's done. Sold. You gave us your word that you'd stop ditching school. My grades are fine. That is not the point. Gordon :  So where were you this afternoon? What's the difference? It's Saturday. My grades are fine, too. Rock on, Max. Deva, this isn't a joke. Your mother and I are worried about you. Well, there's nothing to be worried about. Okay? That's not what it looks like. What... Well, that went well. ( door slams ) I just... I can't do this right now. ( loud music playing ) Hey, we are not finished. Women, right? ( chuckles ) You little... ( growls ) Dad... If you turn into a teenager, I will kill you. ( Max laughs ) ( speaking Pennsylvania Dutch ) Mr. Bowman. Deputy Brock. What can we do for you? You are the new sheriff? That's right. Something is happening at the Yoder farm tonight. Some kind of a barn party. A rave? Yes. My son used that word. He saw them setting it up. A rave in this town? Emmett. Yeah, thank you for coming in. Sheriff, you'll keep my family's name out of this? Yeah, you were never here. Thank you. My daughter Rebecca. Good evening. Good evening, Sheriff Hood. Very nice to meet you. You, too. Elijah :  Rebecca, get in. ( guns clicking ) What's going on? Are we going to war? These raves are highly organized enterprises. It's designed for the sole purpose of selling drugs. And where there are drugs, there will be guns. Usually by the time we hear about it, the place is trashed and everyone is long gone. Let's go. Right? ( train horn blaring ) Right. Like, oh, my God. There's so many people. We're with Hanson. Beaty and Deva. Girl :  Oh, like that's gonna help? Why don't you wait like everybody else? VIPs? Nice. ( music blaring ) Hey, Hanson! Yeah, police band all quiet? Okay, people, let's get paid. Hey! You made it. Hey. What's up? Oh, my God. Snacks, anyone? Oh, Skulls! What is it? It's E. ( cheering ) Whoo! ( labored breathing ) Hey, baby. You okay? Yeah. Okay. Deva. Deva. Deva! Deva. ( Knocks ) ( music playing ) ( music blaring ) ♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic, psychotic, it's psychotic ♪ 
♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic, psychotic, it's psychotic ♪ 
♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic, psychotic, it's psychotic ♪ 
♪ Psychotic, psychotic, psychotic... ♪ ( music blaring ) So what's the plan? All right, there's only two ways in and out of here... that front entrance and then there's a utility door around back. Should be pretty easy for us to cover. Yeah, but God only knows how many kids are actually in there. Start a panic, this thing could go from bad to worse fast. What are you doing? We need to see inside. If I can find the guy in charge, we can shut this down without starting a riot. So you're just gonna wander in there and ask who's in charge? That's your plan? Yeah. Oh, great. Aren't you kind of old to pass for a teenager? I'm young at heart. Can't be out of uniform, Hood. You are legally required to identify yourself. Is he always this much fun? Yeah, I'm here for the rave. There's no rave here. Come on, guys, what's it gonna take? sh1t. Are you kidding me? He can't... he can't just do that, right? Siobhan : He's waving. Brock : Yeah. What do we do? ( music playing ) Hanson on headset :  Moore, what's your count on the gate? Moore, are you hearing me? I asked what's your count. Moore, what the f*ck? Respond. Someone get me eyes on Moore. Someone get me eyes on Moore. You got nothing? ( ringing ) Hey, it's Deva. Leave a message. Or don't. ( Beeps ) ( music blaring ) ( gagging, coughing ) Reed? Reed. ( gasping ) What is it? Reed! Reed! Help! Somebody help me! ( music blaring ) Reed! Somebody... ( faint ) help! Please! Deva :  Help! Something's wrong. Call the paramedics and get in here. We've got to shut this down fast. Everyone clear out. It's going south. Five-O, move out now! Somebody help! Help! Deva :  Help! Somebody help me. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Move! Look at me. Look at me. You okay? Are you okay? ( Whimpers ) Lucas :  Are you okay? Deva? ( Deva crying ) ( music stops ) This is the BSD. Please start exiting in an orderly fashion. ( gunshots ) ( People screaming ) You stay here. Do not move. Stay there. Get out! Get out! Get out. ( gunshots ) ( Crowd screaming ) ( gunshots ) ( gunshots ) ( gunshots ) ( Sirens blaring ) Man : Hey! ( gunshots ) ( sirens wailing ) Emmett :  You good? I'm good. Man : Is it charged? Man #2 : Charged. ( pulses ) ( Flatlining ) Man : Anything? Deva : No. Man :  All right. Ready? Charge. ( charges ) ( flatlining ) No. All right, we gotta call it. No. No! ( crying ) No! Oh, no! Reed! No! Oh, my God! Shh. It's okay. Deva :  Oh, my God. Shh. ( Crying ) Sit tight. Turn around. Look at this. Reed Schumacher. State Senator Schumacher, that's his son. What the f*ck are you looking at, bitch? Hey, shut your mouth. I asked you a question, bitch... what the f*ck are you looking at? ( grunts ) Sheriff! Sheriff! Hood! Get the f*ck off me. ( man coughing ) Come on, I'll take you both home. Hood, hey, what the f*ck was that? Hey, leave it, Brock. You just beat the sh1t out of a handcuffed perp in front of 10 witnesses. He had it coming. I don't know how you did things out West, but you cannot keep making up the rules as you go along here. All right? You're putting the rest of us in an impossible position. Get in. And what the hell am I supposed to do, huh? You know what? I'd seriously consider resigning. Yeah? Yeah. You know what, Sheriff? I was here long before you and I'm gonna be here long after you're gone, which by the looks of it, is gonna be pretty damn soon. Maybe. Mm-hmm. But right now the smartest career move you could make would be to get the f*ck out of my way. ( growling ) Wait! ( Screaming ) What... You cut my f*cking finger off. Our ecstasy trade generates revenues of a quarter of a million dollars a week in Philadelphia and DC. I spent years and serious money developing that network. And because I'm not a f*cking idiot, I never sold a single pill in this county. I don't sh1t where I sleep, Mr. Hanson. You, on the other hand, have just taken a steaming dump right in the middle of my f*cking bed. You stole my Skulls, you cooked up a tainted batch that killed a boy. But not just any boy. The boy of a state senator. Do you understand? You've unleashed a shitstorm on me. I'm sorry, Mr. Proctor. Now... I want you to look over here at Preacher. Preacher now has a taste for you. I'll give you 60 seconds. What? Are you f*cking serious? Starting now. Fass! ( barking ) ( growling ) ( Hanson screaming ) Please! ( Snarling ) It's a hard thing to see someone die. First time, I was younger than you. A kid from my neighborhood tried to run across the railroad tracks. He tripped on some gravel and... you know. Thing is, you can't make sense out of it. All right? It doesn't make sense. You hear me? You just... I don't know. You accept it at some point. ( sniffles ) Was he a friend of yours? The kid on the tracks? No. No, he was just some asshole from the neighborhood. And I was another asshole who dared him to beat the 5:15 Amtrak. Now you listen to me. Hey. You're gonna be okay.
