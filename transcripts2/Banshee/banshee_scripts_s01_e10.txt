 Previously on Banshee... 
 Who are you? 
 I'm your grandfather. 
 I bet you didn't know your mother could handle a gun, did you? 
 I'm gonna kill you. 
 You already have. 
 There's some men they came here for me. 
 You want my help? 
 I'll owe you one. 
 Max, you don't have to be scared of me. 
 I would never hurt you. 
 You'll always have a home here. 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 Don't seem right burying the sheriff with that pond scum. 
 Your father and I had a deal. 
 We're not partners. 
 You may cause me to rethink my own terms. 
 So you're a pretend policeman now? 
 I just wanted to be the last face you ever saw. 
 ( door clangs ) 
 Woman :  Is there anything you'd like to talk about? 
 Not really. 
 Every week you just sit in silence on that couch. 
 Do you know why you're here? 
 I got caught. 
 No, why you're here with me. 
 I have to go through you to get parole. 
 Well, in a manner of speaking. 
 It's my job to evaluate you, the progress of your rehabilitation. 
 Come on, you really think anyone in here gets rehabilitated? 
 I think we rehabilitate ourselves. 
 ( laughs ) 
 You've been in here for what now, seven years? 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 You've had your share of fights. 
 It's kind of what we do in here. 
 You're eligible for parole in four months. 
 I would think a man of your obvious intelligence and skill would at least create the impression of cooperation with me to manipulate me into recommending parole. 
 Well, maybe I just know not to bullshit a bullshitter. 
 Fair enough. 
 But believe it or not, I am here to help you. Yeah, right. I'm just another file you got to process before you go home to your cats. What makes you think I have cats? Well, I know you have a cat. Cats was a guess. What else? You're wearing a black bra under a white blouse again. It's happened before, so it's not because you didn't get your laundry done. If that were the case, you'd go with no bra. Your tits aren't that big. No, you deliberately project your sexuality. Maybe because of a recent breakup or a divorce. Either way, you get off on sitting across from men who haven't seen a woman in years  knowing that we're gonna go back to our cells and rub one out thinking of you. I mean, why else would a woman that looks like you  work in a place like this? And, yeah, you have cats. Every time you wear dark clothing like that navy pantsuit that you had tailored to cling to your ass like a second skin, I see hairs on you. You're exceptionally observant. Occupational hazard. Of a thief. Inmate. Are you gonna steal again? No. Are you sure? It's a trick question. Why so? If I say no, I'm full of sh1t. If I say yes, I don't get parole. Not everything's a trap. Never say that to a man who's living in a cell. I like you. Isn't that against the rules? Yes. ( theme music playing ) ♪ Banshee 1x10 ♪ 
A Mixture of Madness 
Original Air Date on March 15, 2013 ♪ Lucas :  What do you want, Rabbit? Rabbit :  I just wanted to look into your eyes for the last time. Good-bye. ( guns cocking ) Oh, sh1t. ( automatic gunfire ) ( gunfire stops ) ( gun clicking ) ( gunfire ) ( body thuds ) ( gunshots ) ( bodies thudding ) ( gunfire stops ) ( panting ) I guess you owe me one. Hey. Go ahead. I don't want to play. But it will sharpen your mind, teach you patience. ( laughs ) ( whispering ) ( siren blaring ) ( high-pitched ringing ) Brock :  Holy...  sh1t. Emmett, check the back. Jesus. ( echoing ) Emmett, check the back. ( indistinct conversation ) Brock :  Hell. We need an ambulance. Brock :  Hood, talk to us. What happened here? We just got here. Been out all night looking for the kid. Nothing but dead bodies. Hood? Sheriff Hood! ( high-pitched ringing stops ) I don't know what happened. They just started shooting. These are military grade M4s. That's pretty high-end hardware for this neck of the woods. All I care about now is finding that boy. No, that's my priority and that's my jurisdiction. In my estimation, Sheriff, you've become an impediment to this investigation. I can make a phone call to a judge and have a writ within the hour suspending you from duty. Xavier : Hood. Where the hell do you think you're going? If you want to stop me, you're gonna have to shoot me. Let me have your weapon. Sugar :  What are you looking for? I'll know it when I see it. I can help you. I've lived my whole life here. Which explains why you haven't grasped the concept of personal space. Just tell me what you got. ( sighs ) This is from the traffic camera at the county line yesterday morning. How do you know that's him? New York plates. And Rabbit usually rolls four cars deep. I tried calling our friendly neighborhood sheriff  to put out an APB, but he's apparently not taking calls. At least not mine. I ran the plates, they're counterfeit. But I ain't got no picture of them leaving. They're here. Think he's okay? Job :  He's not okay. If Rabbit's here, no one's okay. I told him, man. I said over and over again we need to get the f*ck out of here. This has never been anything but a terrible idea. How do we find the boy? We hack into street cameras, we look for the cars. We review security footage from mini-marts and supermarkets-- someone had to do a food run. We reroute spy satellites from the CIA and look for heat signatures where they shouldn't be. This is a tiny needle in a big motherfucking haystack. There's just too much ground to cover. I need 20 men doing this and I ain't got 'em. It's just us two. ( door opens ) Or us three. Hey, Job. Long time. Gang's all here. Please. Keep trying. ( Deva crying ) You know they're just here to keep us safe. Hey. You okay? Deva, I'm sorry about all this. Why would she lie to us? Everything's not going to be all right, is it? I don't know, honey. I honestly don't. ( ringing ) ( ringing ) I must admit you have an admirable knack for survival. I'm already dead. I know that. Yes? So why do you resist? You haven't offered any other options. Such as? Surrender. You would sacrifice yourself for the boy? No. For all of them. So... finally you admit your responsibility in all of this. Yes, I do. Rebecca :  Uncle Kai? Hi. Hey. I'm getting a glass of wine downstairs. I'm actually gonna go to sleep. So good night. Good night, Rebecca. ( grunting ) Ah! ( choking ) Who sent you? ( coughing ) f*cking Indians. ( groaning ) ( grunts ) ( groaning ) ( gasping ) Go help your uncle. Doctor :  You've been in a fight. Just a misunderstanding. Do you want to tell me about it? Someone had a crush on me, I just wanted to be friends. Are we done? Not quite. Must be exhausting. ( sighs ) What? Being on guard 24 hours a day. Wondering where the next attack is gonna come from. Can you ever rest? I've been looking at your initial police report. There were two of you in that building. The police said that you had made it as far as the woods where your chance of escape would be much greater,  but yet you turned around. Why? Your accomplice... it was a woman. These sessions are confidential and inadmissible in court. You can't incriminate her. You must have loved her very much. And you haven't seen or heard from her since? I'm so sorry. You okay? Yeah. So where you been? You know, around. Will you stay for awhile now that he's gone? I could really use you. Well, that's not really my bag, big brother. ( tires squealing ) ( gunshots ) ( window shatters ) Ugh. Well, this is interesting. Oh, that m*therf*cker! This is my home. So you're upset that the man who cut off the head of the guy you sent to kill him isn't respecting your privacy? What's this? It's one of ours. I'm thinking maybe I will stick around for a while. This man will take you home, Max. It's okay, Max. Hey. No one's gonna hurt you. Go. ( engine starts ) You trusted me to keep my word? You always have. ( grunts ) ( phone ringing ) Female voice :  Your call has been directed to an automated voice mail-- ( scoffs ) Still no answer. Job : Keep trying. ( thudding ) It's okay. ( door opens ) Gordon. Gordon :  Sugar. What are you doing here? We got Max back. What? What do you mean? How is he? He's safe. He and Deva are with the FBI. He came home a little while ago. How? He just rang the doorbell. Said that they dropped him off a block away from the house. I don't understand. What do you mean? They just-- they just dropped him off just like that? No, not just like that. Your father told him to tell you something. What? He said that you were forgiven. Hood. Max said they have him. He traded himself for Max. I don't understand why Hood would think that that's something-- His cell phone. What? I got a tracker on his cell phone. There you are. Carrie :  What is that? Where is that? Sugar :  The Bottoms near the North Valley Woods. What the f*ck are the Bottoms? What's out there? Well, nothing that I can think of. Wait. The metalworks. We've been here all day looking at these maps, moving satellites around in outer f*cking space, and then he says, "Wait, wait, the metalworks." Sugar :  Well, the Bottoms aren't on most maps. Is that it? Is that it right there? Yeah. Gordon :  What are you doing? You call the FBI and you let them handle this. I can't. You have to. Now, I don't know what Hood's role in all this is,  but we have two children whose lives have been turned upside down. Now, nothing and no one else is more important than that. Come on, man. Come on. Now, you lied to me. You lied to our kids. I don't know if you can ever make that right, but if you're gonna try, you need to come home with me right now. Gordon, don't do this. Don't make me choose. You go with them, you're making that choice yourself. Um, what are you doing? Look, I've seen you drive. Get in. We're probably gonna die. Probably. If we do die, I just want you to know I don't like you very much. Duly noted. Well, if you're going to drive, then drive. I want to be dead or home by morning. Just drive. So your parole hearing is in two weeks. Do you feel ready? Uh, yeah, yeah. I think so. I know you're ready to get out of here. You think they'll let me out? You present as intelligent and capable, as remorseful and articulate. Plus, you have the single best psych eval ever written in the history of the prison system, so... Thank you. I just wish... What? Nothing. Come on, what? Nothing, no. I'm sorry. I forgot myself for a moment. It's our last session. You're never gonna see me again. Um, I was gonna say I just wish we had met under different circumstances. I know it's a pathetic cliché. No, no. It's not. Um, you saved me in here. Are you scared? Terrified. Are you gonna see Ana when you get out? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I've got a few places I think I can... look for her. 
 
 Who are you? What? Who the f*ck are you? I never told you her name. Mr. Rabbit has a message for you. Mr. Rabbit says there'll be no parole. You will serve out the remaining eight years. And he wants you to know that when you do get out, he'll be waiting for you. There's nowhere you can go that he won't find you. ( screams ) Help me! Guard, help me! ( gasping ) Get off! Get off! Oh, God! ( gasping ) ( electricity crackling ) It's funny being here with you. I think of all that time we were together, the three of us. We were a family. Don't kid yourself. We were never a family. Me and Ana, we were family. Not you. I think maybe we both kid ourselves sometimes. Oh, f*ck you. You betrayed me for love. Then you got out of prison to find your love had betrayed you. And then a few days ago, she barters your life for her own. ( laughs ) My daughter is better at punishing you than I could ever be. However, a man can still try. Sugar :  Oh, wow. ( tires squeal ) What is it? sh1t. I don't know. ( siren blaring ) sh1t! Were you speeding? I knew I shouldn't have let you drive. Evening, folks. Mrs. Hopewell, I don't know if you heard yet, but your son turned up safe. I know. Thank you. And...  you--  you three are clearly not going to a PTA meeting. Can you step out of the car, Mrs. Hopewell? Rabbit :  There. That's better, right? ( muffled gagging ) ( gasping ) You took my only daughter from me. There are no words to express the pain. The rage I feel. Oh, believe me, she couldn't get away from you fast enough. ( muffled gagging ) ( gasping ) She hated you  more than she ever loved me. You're right. I took your little girl. And there is nothing that you can do to me that can ever change that. At least I can watch you pay for your betrayal. Why don't you shut the f*ck up and get on with it? We got the call. What's going on? Brock : She's telling me that Hood has been kidnapped by the same guys that took her son. He wasn't kidnapped. He traded himself for Max. And they're gonna kill him if I don't get over there. Look, if Hood is in trouble, why wouldn't you call us? Because I can't involve you in this. It's an abduction and you can't involve the sheriff's department? That's kind of strange, don't you think? Brock :  You think that's strange? Take a look at who she called instead. Oh, and Mrs. Hopewell was strapped with these. Two Springfield DX9s. You want to tell us what the hell's going on? The man who has Hood is a gangster named Rabbit. He and I have a history. It's me he's here for. That's why he took Max. He's got a small army with him and he's not gonna think twice about killing you or me or anyone else who gets in his way. Well, what were you and the A-Team over here planning to do? He's going to kill him. He may already have. Please, we are wasting time right now. This-- this is crazy. Sorry, I don't-- You're the sheriff. I know I am. What? If it was you they had, or any one of us, what do you think Hood would do? sh1t. I don't care what kind of gangsters they are. They picked the wrong f*cking town. Well, all right. ( engine starts ) You sure about this? Do I look sure? Gregor, tell the men to start packing up. We're leaving soon. When I was a teenager... I found two boys in a field. They had tied a stray dog to a tree and they were beating it with sticks. He was badly hurt, bleeding. His front leg was broken. After I finished with the boys... I decided I would care for the dog. But when I went to untie him, he bit my leg. The dog meant me no harm. He was acting on instinct. I knew that. But I also knew I had to kill him... because I, too, was acting on instinct. We're all animals, really. ( sighs ) Gentlemen. ( chuckles ) Who the f*ck are you? I'm gonna need you to open this here gate. This is private property. No one enters. Oh, honey, if I had a dollar for every time I heard that. Now open the motherfucking gate. f*ck you. Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it? Eenie meenie miney mo. ( silenced gunshot ) My bad. ( silenced gunshot ) Nice shooting. I've been taking lessons. I should have killed you 15 years ago. But there was a part of me that hoped that you'd-- both of you-- would change your minds. All right, hold up. Hold up. The only entrance to this place is on the other side. We're gonna be outnumbered and outgunned. We have to surprise them. I'll create a diversion. You guys go up front and wait for my signal. And then what? What's your plan? Save Hood, shoot everybody else. Like you, I was blinded by love. No. This isn't about love. We spent two years figuring out how to f*ck you over. And we did. That's why you're angry. 'Cause you got played. So do me a favor. Stop whining about f*cking love. You don't know what love is. ( wings flapping ) ( bird cawing ) You're wrong. ( groans ) This... is love. ( silenced gunshot ) ( man screams ) ( wings flutter ) Brock : Go now! Go, go! f*ck! ( men shouting ) ( groans ) Siobhan : Sugar! Sugar! Go! ( men shouting ) ( gunfire continues ) ( distant gunfire ) I knew she'd come for you. Now she can watch you die. ( knife twists ) ( groans ) Yes! ( gunfire continues ) Brock! ( screaming ) m*therf*cker! Brock's hit. I know. There's no way I can get to him. He's too far away. Go around and I'll cover you. (in Russian) Vanya, someone passing from your back. Four on the right. Can't see the girl ( groans ) ( screams ) I'm running out of ammo! ( shouting ) God damn it! Emmett! Emmett :  sh1t, I'm running out. ( screams ) ( screams ) How you doing? Oh, f*ck, that hurts. Sugar? He's okay. He's over there. I'm fine. Did we win? We didn't lose. ( door creaking ) Suck my tit. ( screaming ) ( speaks Ukrainian ) ( gunshot ) ( man grunts ) ( gunshots ) ( roaring ) ( panting ) Stay away from him. I forgave you. I gave you back your son. Well, I never forgave you. So what now,  clever girl? Good-bye, Daddy. ( grunts ) Hey. Let me see you. Oh, God. Oh, my God. ( both panting ) My God. Max? He's safe. He's okay. Next time, I say we just run away. Hang on, okay?

That's why Longshadow wanted you killed? Yeah. So now what? Well, I could just get rid of Alex, but that would create a power vacuum within the tribe and there's no telling who would take over. Better let Alex understand who his friends are. And how do we do that? We could start with a phone call. You just hit send. ( phone ringing ) Hello? ( ringing ) Is anyone here?

And what went down at the metalworks, that's gonna take some time to sort out. The Bureau is assigning a special investigator. Look, in the meantime, you're just gonna have to deal with federal oversight. So, never a dull moment around here, huh? Couple of hunters found them this morning.
