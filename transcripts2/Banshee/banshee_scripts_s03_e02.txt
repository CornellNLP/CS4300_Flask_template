 3x02 - "Snakes and Whatnot" 
 [chatter] 
 Where were you? I'm drowning out here. 
 Sorry. Two short stacks. 
 Let me get you guys some more syrup. 
 Enjoying the show? 
 Best seat in the house. 
 What are you doing? 
 [gasping] 
 [moans] 
 I'll catch you later. 
 Hey. 
 So when are we gonna stop driving separate cars to work? 
 As soon as we stop living at separate addresses. 
 Right. 
 I mean, I'm not pushing for that. 
 No. It's okay. You can push a little. 
 Oh, really? 
 Yeah, just a little. 
 [Siobhan laughs] 
 Can I help you? 
 My name is Kurt Bunker, sir. 
 I'm here to apply for the open deputy position. 
 Seriously? 
 I understand that my physical appearance may be unsettling, but I can assure you my ties to the movement were severed long ago. 
 Unfortunately, the removal of my tattoos has taken longer than anticipated. 
 Dade County Sheriff's Department. 
 You're a long way from Florida. 
 I was born in Banshee. 
 Just became prudent for me to distance myself from former associates. 
 Then why are you back? 
 It was time to come home, ma'am. 
 What do your former associates think about that? 
 What they think is none of my concern. 
 Sorry, Bunker. Position's filled. 
 You can hold onto that. I appreciate your time. 
 Was that for real? 
 I kind of liked him. 
 [laughs] 
 Mr. Cage. 
 Mr. Proctor. 
 How are you, Kai? 
 Good. Thanks for coming. 
 Cage : I couldn't turn down an invitation from an old friend. 
 Who is this pretty young thing? 
 Oh, that's Rebecca Bowman, my niece. 
 I'm introducing her to the family business. 
 Proctor pulled the kid out of high school for a little show-and-tell. 
 Martin, watch your mouth. Show a little respect. 
 Sorry, Kai. 
 So what was it you wanted to see me about? 
 Well, old friend, we need to clarify our arrangement. 
 What arrangement is that? 
 While my factory was down for three weeks, you began supplying my Philadelphia customers. 
 I understand the impulse. You saw an opportunity. 
 But I'm up and running again now, so we got to go back to things as they were before. 
 I stay out of Ohio and you stay out of Pennsylvania. 
 You couldn't supply them, they came to me. 
 Plain and simple. Just business. 
 You f*cked up, Proctor. You don't get to take that back. 
 What did you just say? 
 Your uncle may be a big deal here in Banshee, 
 but in the rest of the world,  he's just a country inbreed with an inflated ego. 
 Martin, shut your mouth. 
 I got it, Dad. 
 Yeah, I heard you were a scary dude back in the day, but he doesn't look so scary now, does he? 
 Martin, shut... 
 [gunshots] 
 [groans] 
 Kai : Rebecca, no! 
 Ah! 
 [Martin whimpering] 
 [groaning] 
 [Martin groaning] 
 Finish what you started. 
 [breathing heavily] No. No. 
 [gunshot] 
 Alison : Just got off the phone with Sperling. Proctor will plead to a single misdemeanor weapons charge in exchange for time served. I told him to go to hell. Yeah, we'll make the deal. What? Call Sperling back and tell him that we'll... I heard what you said. Then why are we still talking about it? We've got a shot at putting Proctor away and you just want to roll over and play dead. No, I'm done fighting battles I won't win. Are you still on the pills? No, I'm clean. So, I... I get to experience every single moment with total clarity. Look, if you'll excuse me, I need to... I need to get back to being the mayor. What does that entail, exactly? [chuckles] I'll let you know when I figure it out. Thanks. Bad enough you got us robbing a military base, now we got to worry about all these motherfucking Rambos killing our asses. You know, the colonel's got the Marines guarding the money. What the hell does he need the mercs for? 'Cause it ain't Uncle Sam's cash they're protecting. Turns out not everything is kosher at Boy Scout camp. The official log accounts for nine million in that safe. What about the unofficial log? That's saying closer to 15. Someone's cooking the books. Not just someone. Colonel Douglas Stowe. Naval Academy grad, first in his class. Tours in Beirut, Panama, and then Haiti. After that, he took a little walk on the wild side. We're talking about a string of nasty black ops in Iraq and Afghanistan. This ain't just another bad m*therf*cker, this the guy they send in to clean out all the other bad M*therf*ckers. [helicopter blades whirring] On the other hand, you steal from a thief... no one calls the cops. The cops won't come after us with hit teams and Apache helicopters. [birds chirping] [crows cawing] [music] You are not welcome here. Kai. [speaks Pennsylvania Dutch] You did not have to come. You have a fever. It's just a touch of the flu. Kai : Here, drink some water. How can you allow this to go on? The doctor was here. He gave her medicine. She doesn't need a house call. She needs a hospital. He will be here again tomorrow. We will ask him. But that's not good enough. Leave her! Oh, Kai. Get out of my way. We can take care of her here. Doctor : Your mother is suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer. Kai : How much time, Doctor? Doctor : A month, maybe less. I'm going to put you down, Mother. Can you stand? Yeah. Your mother is dying, Mr. Proctor. You should start thinking about how you can make her most comfortable. [car engine starts] [knocks] Hey. Hey. You okay? Before you answer that. Don't. Stop. Stop! I can't do this anymore. Do I get an explanation? Does it really matter? Your husband? No. Somebody else? There's no time for anyone else. There isn't even time for this. Then what's the problem? My kids. They need their mother at home, not sneaking out at night for booty calls. This isn't about your kids. It's about you. Don't do that. This is a bubble. This isn't anything. What we had was great, but I've got to get back to the real world. Take care of yourself, okay? All right. Lucas : You really like your military men. [gasps] [lighter flicks] What are you doing here? [blows smoke] I was gonna ask you the same thing. Who I f*ck is none of your business. It is when it affects the job. And how about you getting involved with your deputy sheriff? How does that affect the job? We can't do the heist if you're involved with the target. I already broke it off. Are we done? Should I be worried? I told you I'd be ready. I'm not talking about the job. I gotta get home. [door opens, closes] [gunfire] [ricochets] Chayton : Hold your fire! Adolf Hitler's favorite game was cowboys and Indians. He called the Russians redskins and found inspiration in the white man's ethnic cleansing of our Navajo kin. Now Proctor has slaughtered our chief and continues to take what is rightfully ours. Viho, Songaa. Go get Proctor and the girl. Bring them back here. Hey. I should be the one getting Proctor. Not now. I've got other plans for you. Chayton. Everyone here thinks I get a free ride 'cause I'm your brother. I need to show them. You need to be patient. [knocks] Alison. I need your signature on the plea deal before I can file. Come in. I included a future crime clause. If Proctor gets so much as a speeding ticket, we can revoke the plea deal and reopen the case. Can I pour you a drink? I'm fine. All right. Suit yourself. I like the new apartment. [laughs] Yeah, you know, for a lawyer, you're a pretty shitty liar. Well, you have to at least put in some effort. Set up the kids' rooms. Hang pictures. Start cooking in the kitchen so it smells like home. Yeah. You cook? [chuckles] I dabble. Why don't you stick around and teach me? Gordon, I know you've been through the wringer, but you've got to get it together. That was out of line. You think? Alison... look, you don't have to go. I respect you too much to watch you embarrass yourself like this. Nola. You know, I thought you'd gone native, but this... this is a whole new level. I'm glad you like it. I'm glad you think I like it. I wondered if you'd come back. I wondered the same thing. Every time I think I'm rid of this goddamn place... This place is your home. It's your home! It's not mine. You are a Kinaho woman. Fat lot of good that did me growing up here. I know you suffered greatly back then... You think you know. Chayton: Nola. Nola : What? Let me die. We already had this conversation in New Orleans. Can we not do it again? You're already dead. I'm very sorry about your brother. You despised Alex. I pitied him. He forgot who he was, but his murder was a tragedy and we will avenge it. By sending a couple of gangbangers to Proctor's house? They can handle it. Alex is dead because he underestimated Proctor. With all due respect, I am not Alex! No. No, you're not. Alex never liked you. He thought you were bad for the tribe. I am the tribe. Yeah, I really don't care. Nola. Don't get in my way. He was my brother, Chayton. And you will have your blood. When you say? Yes. No. Job over com : There's an old steam tunnel buried underneath the base. It's like our own personal VIP entrance. Hood : We're in. Sugar : Okay, now y'all be careful down there. You know, snakes and whatnot. After you. Just like old times. Lucas: So how we doing with the vault? Based on your description, How many locks? Two. One mechanical, the other digital. If we get past the rolling encryption code, I'll have to drill through six inches of reinforced steel to disable the tumbler system. Job can handle the encryption code. It changes every 12 minutes. We'll have to work fast, then. And by "we", you mean me. Yep. [knocks] [door opens] You wanted to see me, sir? Sit. My unit was point for black ops in Afghanistan. Asset recovery, bag grabs, the dirty stuff. One night we came under fire. Not just a couple of insurgents with small arms, dozens of them all armed to the teeth. Someone had tipped them off. I called for air support, but it never came. President's troop reductions meant less support Murphy and I were the only ones to make it out. The powers that be let seven good men, patriots, die for politics. That's why I only trust my people. This was found beneath a floorboard under your bunk. It's not mine. You're an idiot, Haddock. I could have made you rich and you blew it, for what? 30 grand? Sir, I swear... [groans] Did I tell you to stand? [groans] [Haddock gurgling] Lock him in the brig. [door closes] 
 
 Seems too easy. Yeah? Maybe Stowe doesn't know about the tunnel. [laughs] He knows. We got a solid steel door blocking us. Job : How thick? [tapping] About 12 inches. Shape charges? Now you're talking my language. Now hold on. If those walls are not properly reinforced, your language will bring down the whole damn tunnel. What do you suggest? Look, I'll pull the door off the hinges the old-fashioned way. Like you got any other motherfucking way. [music] [breathing heavily] [moaning] Man on radio : Checking in. All rooms secure. [grunts] [gasps] [moaning] [grunts] [grunts] [groans] [groans] Go find Proctor. [screams] [groans] [gasps] I'm starving. [exhales] There's some shepherd's pie in the fridge. Ooh, beef or turkey? I stopped eating red meat. You should, too. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. You know what? I'll make us something to eat. I'll make us some sandwiches. You got some lunch meat? Some cold cuts? Alma on radio : Brock, what's your current location, over? Don't. She'll find somebody else. I'm still on duty. Give it to me. Just let it... Come on, give it to me. I'm not messing around, Em. Come on. Damn it! Uh... uh, yeah, this is Brock. Go ahead, Alma. Alma : We got a call of a disturbance at the Proctor place. Casualties reported. Brock : Copy that. I'm on my way. Job still comes first, huh? [sighs] Come on. Just like the old days. Em. What do you want from me? I want you to leave. You know what? You're in luck. [door opens, closes] I need pictures of everything. Tell her to keep it in focus this time. [phone ringing] I can hear you, Job. Job : Oh, I know. Hold on one second. Hood. Hey, it's Brock. Look, we got a DOA in Proctor's pool. Redbone.  Looks like he and his buddy roughed up the niece pretty bad. I'm on my way. I gotta go. Job : f*ck you mean you gotta go? I'm still on duty. Ana will finish up down here. Baby, this whole fake sheriff bullshit is getting in the way of your real job. You hear me? Lucas : Hard not to. [quiet chatter] [police radio chatter] [speaking quietly] You all right? Hey, Brock. Give us a minute. Sheriff. You started this war when you took out Longshadow. Yeah, well, you would know about starting wars, Sheriff. Chayton's not gonna stop coming for you. That's unfortunate for Chayton and anyone else who comes after what's mine. Okay, let me be clear. You and the Redbones can tear each other apart. I don't give a sh1t. Just hurry the f*ck up. My house was violated by these lowlifes. You do your job, Sheriff. Hey, Raven. Come here. You know the reservation. Where do we start? We can't just go to the reservation. Yeah, we can. I do it all the time. ♪ Gather on the strand ♪ ♪ With sprinkles in each hand ♪ ♪ Going to battle ♪ ♪ Blowhards thinking that they will lose ♪ ♪ The water will casually follow its route ♪ ♪ Chorus: Route ♪ ♪ And the bird will be better off ♪ ♪ Flying the coop ♪ ♪ Chorus: Coop. ♪ This is it? Yep, Dog Iron. A lot of Redbones hang out here. Drinks are cheap and nobody bothers them. Hmm, well, let's see what we can do about that. Can we get a couple of drinks? Sure, three miles down the road. Hey, Sue. Billy, you know better than to show up here in that uniform. Then just tell me if you've seen Chayton. Get the hell out of here. People are getting hurt. Our people. All I know is that they're deep in the woods. Whereabouts in the woods? You gotta go. Man : Yo, Raven. Thanks for your time. What do you think your old man would say if he knew you were taking orders from the white man? Move, Spatch. Or what? You sure that's how you want to play this? [laughs] Your, uh, badge... don't mean sh1t around here. Well, the badge is the last thing you should worry about. How's that? Sit the f*ck down. [gunshot] How about we all put our dicks away? It's good to see you, too, Aimee. What the hell, Billy? The hospice nurse is here. Mr. Proctor. Ms. Lotus. Thank you for coming on such short notice. You came highly recommended, you know. Please, call me Emily. All right, Emily. Why don't you make yourself at home here? And anything you need, just ask. Why don't you start by introducing me to your mother? This is Leah, my mother, and Rebecca, my niece. It's a pleasure to meet you both. Emily will be staying with us, Mother, to help care for you. What happened to you? I... I had an accident. Well, have you put anything on those cuts? No. Here. It'll help keep you from scarring. You've got great skin. Thank you. Let me show you to your room. Notie and Spatch were looking for a fight. You were looking for a fight. What are you thinking going to the Dog Iron in a BSD uniform? He was following me. I wasn't talking to you. We're looking for Chayton Littlestone. You know him? Is he serious? We're on the same side here. Get off the res, Billy. If Yaz finds out that you're out here... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's Yaz? Karl Yazzie. Chief of the Kinaho PD. Lucas : Sounds like someone I should meet. Let's go. I'll take you. No, you should probably get in your car and drive away if you know what's good for you. Do I look like someone who knows what's good for him? [car door slams] [police radio chatter] Raven : Chief. Yazzie : You must have made a wrong turn, boy. This is the Kinaho Police Department. And who do we have here? Sheriff Lucas Hood. You busted that fat b*st*rd that killed the Cleary girl. I'm surprised you know about that, seeing as you didn't lift a finger to help. Happened on your beat, not mine. I stay on my side of the line. Okay, well, Chayton and the Redbones, they hijacked a truck from Camp Genoa. Stole about a dozen crates of AKs and M4s. What? When? Sounds like a military issue. Not if the guns end up in Banshee. Sorry, I can't tell you where the man is if I don't know. But we'll keep an eye out for him. You'll keep an eye out? None of your business, huh? [laughs] Let's go. Oh, one other thing, Sheriff. Yeah? I call you sheriff as a courtesy, even though out here you've got no standing. The next time you pull some sh1t like you did today, I'm gonna have BIA crawling all over your ass. You mind your own backyard and we'll mind ours. Billy. That goes for you, too. So Yaz is dirty? No. That would actually require ambition. Yazzie gave up on that a long time ago. Between the tribal council and the Redbones, he's everyone's bitch. What about the girl? Aimee? She's the real deal. She just wants to make a difference. She doesn't like you much. Yeah, she feels I abandoned her. She's not wrong. But I had to get my family out. You got kids? Yeah, two little girls. Rachel and Kim. You? No. No kids. [music] [knocks] Jenny. Mr. Mayor. Jenny : Living room or bedroom? Gordon : I think I'm gonna, um... I'm... I'm really tired. I... I bet I can wake you up. No, Jenny... Look, I shouldn't have called you. For your trouble. Try again tomorrow? No, I... I think this is the end of the road for us. Well, if you change your mind, you know where you can find me. Kitchen's closed, men. That's all right. We already ate. I would think after a guy like you got his ass kicked by a woman, the last thing he'd want to do is bring his friends over to watch it happen again. You got a smart mouth on you, bitch. So I hear. I'm gonna shut it for you tonight permanently. Listen, it's been a long day and I'm all out of repartee. So if you came here to fight, quit whining like a little girl and get right down to it. What's going on here? Get lost, Pocahontas. Ain't none of your business. Normally, I'd agree. But if you're messing with the only person who can serve me some of that apple pie, then I'm afraid it is my concern. I'll give you three seconds to walk your pretty little ass out that door before I... [groans] Don't talk about my ass. So, how about that pie? You got it. [door opens] You're Alex Longshadow's sister. Nola. And you're the New York mobster's daughter. Carrie. Sorry about your brother. Sorry about your life. Those are nice. What are they, Glocks? Modified 17Cs. Cycle at 1,200 rounds per minute. Mmm, more of a Springfield girl myself. Different strokes. That's a great pie. They bake it here? I should know the answer to that. I don't. I do know where they keep the Scotch. Sins of the fathers. Amen. [clinks] [train horn blaring] [knocking] Hey. Hi. I, um, thought we could hang out. [chuckles] You shouldn't really be here. Don't you have school? [scoffs] Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so then after school? I can come by the Cadi. No, Deva... Don't you want to get to know me? Yes. Then why won't you? Look, I know this is confusing for you, but Gordon raised you, he loves you, he's your father. And what about you? You told me you stayed in Banshee because of me. I had to make sure you're okay. I'm not. [sighs] f*ck! [knocks] [gun cocks] ♪ I have always been a drifter ♪ ♪ Drifting right on by ♪ ♪ Can't stay tied down for no one ♪ ♪ Just trying to dream my dream out loud ♪ ♪ Ooh, oh-oh, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ Hey, I love your energy ♪ ♪ Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ Hey, I love your energy ♪ ♪ Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ Hey, I love your energy. ♪ [radio squealing] Man on radio : Get down!
