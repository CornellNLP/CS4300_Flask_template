 Previously on Banshee... 
 Let the girl go. 
 ( gunshots ) 
 The spirit horse is coming for me. 
 My son will fulfill my promises. 
 But if he breaks it, it won't be a good day for the tribe. 
 Sorry. I've been back in the ring. 
 I've lost count of the people I hurt. 
 You have no idea what that does to you. 
 Why don't you just admit that you like being bad? 
 That accent, where are you from? 
 I'd rather talk about where I am. 
 Just get everything out on the table? 
 Tell me about the Sheriff.

Original Air Date on March 1, 2013 
 ( both panting ) 
 Mama? 
 No, no, no. Mama! 
 No. 
 Don't let them do this. 
 Mama, please! Please, Mama, please! 
 Don't do this, Father. 
 You did this. 
 Daddy! 
 You did this! 
 ( crying ) Mama! 
 Mama, don't do this to me! 
 Mama. 
 Please. 
 ( bell tolling ) 
 Don't go. 
 Please don't. 
 Ana. 
 Don't. 
 We can leave. 
 Ana, we-- we can go anywhere. 
 This  is  my anywhere. 
 Carrie Hopewell is not real. 
 She's a hiding place. 
 You have to let me go. 
 There's nothing in this world that makes sense if there's no you and me. 
 Nothing. 
 You know that, the same way I do. 
 You're still in there. I know you are. 
 The whole time I was in prison,  you know what kept me alive? 
 You, not Carrie Hopewell. 
 Ana-- your Ana is dead. 
 What we had back then, that's dead. 
 That's what's not real anymore. 
 No. 
 This is what's real. 
 You're wrong! 
 Things change. 
 I changed. 
 I know how much you loved me. 
 I loved you just like that, but I don't anymore. 
 I'm not Ana anymore. 
 Yes, you are! 
 You were last night and I f*ckin' know that! 
 Last night? 
 You and I never got a chance to say goodbye. 
 That's what last night was-- it was goodbye. 
 And now you have to move on. 
 What, just like that? 
 I went to prison for you. 
 I know. It's not fair. 
 I'm sorry, but I have a family to protect. 
 It's my family! 
 I knew she was mine the first moment I saw her. 
 Say it. 
 She's yours. 
 She is. 
 She's yours. I'm sorry. Lucas :  What did you tell Gordon? ( Carrie sighs ) Well, he must have known she wasn't his. I told him you were dead. Perfect. Okay? I was broke and I was pregnant and I was all alone. I couldn't fence the diamonds. The minute they hit the street, Rabbit would have been all over me. Job had given me Carrie, but I had to find a safe place to stop. And Gordon-- he just got out of the Marines and I was a waitress and he always came to my restaurant. I don't wanna hear this sh1t. I had to find a safe home for your daughter! ( sniffles ) I didn't fall for him. I was waiting for you. Deva came, this beautiful little girl. My little girl. He raised her like his own. She's not his. She's mine. Carrie :  It's not about you and me anymore. How many lives are you willing to destroy to take back what you think is yours? Look... do you honestly think Deva would be better off with you? I think she deserves to know the truth. Look at you. Look at me. The last thing any of us needs is the truth. You say you love me. If that's true, If I don't? Then what? You've already turned me into Rabbit. If you don't, I'll kill you myself. Stop following me, damn it. You can't keep doing-- Hello, Ana. Olek. Your father would like to see you. But he did say I could kill you if you became a problem. Are you going to be a problem? No. You look good, Ana. He has missed you terribly. He's insane. He loves his daughter. Olek, you can't bring me to him. Please. We'll take my car. Get in. I'm not getting in there. Olek-- Yes, you are. Hey, Olek. You can stay here as long as you like. Thank you. I really didn't have anywhere else to go. I'd have been offended if you went anywhere else. I was just 19 when I left. These men, thugs, really, were preying on our farmers' produce wagons. They wanted us to pay protection money. But anyway, I got tired of turning the other cheek, so one day, I didn't. I took three of them apart with an old ball peen hammer. You should have seen the looks on their faces when this Amish kid came at them. Not what they expected. But the elders condemned my actions, wanted me to show contrition for defending them. I guess I wasn't built for contrition. Whatever happens, you'll always have a home here. Thank you. Why don't you get yourself settled? I'll leave you some lunch downstairs. I've got to run out for a few hours. When I come back, we can talk all this through. Okay? Okay. ( handcuffs clicking ) ( spits ) He's going to torture you. You will beg to be killed. Why don't we skip all the ominous threats and macho bullshit, stick to the facts? Good. Is Rabbit here? No, but he's coming. Well, he hasn't made any calls today. No texts, nothing. He knows where I am. ( speaking Ukrainian ) ( speaking Ukrainian ) Okay, English, please. f*ck you! That's better, thanks. Great. Now look what you've done. ( whirs ) What the f*ck are you hiding? Bullshit! Carrie : I asked you to leave. I begged you. He's gonna kill all of us. Not if I kill him first. Oh, please. Think about it. Olek-- he put you in the trunk. He didn't kill you. He was here to bring you back. Rabbit must want you before me. Olek hasn't checked in yet. That buys us some time. Okay. Time for what? We go to New York, we take him out. Jesus Christ. We storm the castle. It's the last thing he's going to expect. Because it's suicide. So is staying here, Ana. He's gonna be waiting for us. Oh, my God, my babies, Gordon-- I've put them all in danger. Yeah, you have. Well, we were safe until you got here. How many other mothers carry guns in their purse? Or fake license plates in their car? You knew this day was coming. You've known it every day since the day you landed here. And every one of those days you lied to your family,  not me. Carrie Hopewell was never built to last. You've been on borrowed time since you got here and you know it. I love my family. I'd die to keep them safe. Hey, I won't let anything happen. Promise. This room smells of s*x. I wonder, is it still adultery if your marriage is a lie? Thank you. You're welcome. Always sneaking around, you two. Even back then, always this forbidden love, like Shakespeare. So romantic. We're getting off topic here. Olek :  I wonder, how do you think he knew? What? How did he find out? Rabbit. You were so careful all the time. The way you met in his apartment, the hours you kept, the special phones you had. Oh, yeah, I knew about the phones. You're the one who told him. Yes. ( speaking Ukrainian ) ( speaking Ukrainian ) ( car pulls up ) Who's here? Who's here? Uh-oh. Who is it? Lucas :  sh1t. Uh, it's no one. It's no one. I'll take care of it. Keep an eye on him, all right? Hey. Hey. I was just coming to see you. Yeah, listen, um, I'm kind of busy right now. Can we do this later? I really need to talk to you. Okay, look, you just can't be here right now. I've been hearing that a lot today. Aw, sh1t. ( sighs ) I'll-- I'll give you a lift. Come on. To where? I know it may not seem this way, but your father loves you very deeply. ( scoffs ) He will still kill you, I think. But this is what love does, right? It kills us. It's gonna kill you. What? You think I don't remember how you used to look at me? How you would hug and kiss me every time you saw me? ( speaking Ukrainian ) That's why you told Rabbit about us. Because you thought it would clear the field for you. And that's why you came here alone. Because you wanted to see me alone. ( speaking Ukrainian ) You're crazy. Olek, it's okay. It is. I know you love me. I would have been good to you. ( speaking Ukrainian ) I should kill you right here. Kill me. ( speaks Ukrainian ) Help me. ( speaking Ukrainian ) I can't. You should run. I've been running my whole life. You should run now. ( monitor beeping ) You don't belong here. How is he? This is a sacred ritual. It's not for outsiders. I just want to say goodbye. Please? ( respirator hissing ) ( whispering ) He was a great man and a good friend. I know you will continue his work. Goodbye, Mr. Proctor. ( gunshots ) ( coughs ) f*ck. You've been training. You knew you would have to face me one day. Sure, make it all about you. ( laughs ) Your punches are sharp. You have speed and your balance is good,  but you're still a woman. So it's not dangerous, not really. It's just cute. Cute enough for you? Rebecca : Why can't we talk at your place? No, that's-- that's not a good idea. What, are you married? No, no. It's, um... This is not a good time to be around me. It was a good time when you were f*cking me. You, uh-- you got enough money? I'm not a whore. No, no, no. No. Hey, hey, hey. Oh! 
 
 ( children laughing ) What the hell is wrong with you? ( speaking Pennsylvania Dutch ) ( speaking Pennsylvania Dutch ) Do you know who I am? I'm your uncle. Your mother's my sister just like Rebecca's yours. Your mother treats me like trash, like a stranger. Kai! Oh, shut up, Miriam. You haven't spoken my name in 20 years. There's no reason to start now. You asked me to speak to her, and then you shunned her before I could. When we spoke, I did not know the full extent of her transgression. What kind of father turns his back on his daughter at the time she most needs him? Our church is very clear-- f*ck your goddamn church! Kai. Suddenly, everyone remembers my name. Israel : This is not your business. Kai : Take the girl back. She is not a girl. She is a woman. And we did not reject her. You should know as well as anyone  that it was she who rejected our ways, just as you did. Yeah. And now in the absence of true contrition, you'll toss her out like garbage. What about your own contrition? Who calls you to account for these inquisitions of yours? What do you feel when you see me? Hmm? Does it even hurt you at all? My son is dead. And I finished mourning him years ago. You are a criminal and a trespasser. I insist you leave our land at once. Or what? Hmm? Or what? Be careful, Father. I have swallowed your insults for years, but don't mistake my tolerance for weakness. You all live here because I choose to allow it. Not God. It's me, your dead son! I allow it! And if I decide I don't want you here anymore, there's no God that'll be able to protect you from me. I'll show you all what it feels like to be cast out. f*ck. Come on, Anastasia. You were always such a stubborn girl. You can't be finished yet. Yah! Sheriff. I was just coming to see you. Listen, I gotta go. Sheriff, I was hoping that we could talk. About what? My superiors are starting to take an interest in you. And I just got official word that's there's going to be a formal investigation into yesterday's shooting. What, are you f*ckin' kidding me? They were career criminals. They're murderers. That's what you get for making news during an election year. Politicians, they love their hearings. But me-- I'm like you. See, I like results. I really do have to go. I thought we might combine our resources and try to figure out what happened to that evidence against Proctor, how it found its way out of a locked room, because that was a tough-- Okay, listen. call Alma, set something up, okay? I can't do this right now. No, we're gonna talk right now. I'm starting to wonder about you. Look, I keep coming up against these walls everywhere I go, but I can feel them starting to crumble. Something tells me it's gonna be worth it to stick around and watch them all come tumbling down. Alex : Nola. Hi, Mom. When did you get back? Just now. There's still time. You should go to him. I didn't come here for him, brother. Well, he'd be glad to know you're here. Which is why I'm not gonna stay. I'll be crashing at your place. Let me know when he's dead. You look just like her. What? Your mother. You have her face. Almost exactly. I was only a boy when she died, but I remember her very well. She was a beautiful woman. So sad you never got to meet her. He never got over her death. When a woman dies in childbirth-- It wasn't my fault. You were all he had left. But you were also the thing that killed her. ( groans ) Maybe he made mistakes, but everything he did, he did out of love. It breaks my heart to hit you. Then stop. I can't do it anymore. Olek, he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. No. He will kill you and your family. ( cries out ) ( grunts ) ( roaring ) You betrayed your family. You don't deserve to have another one. ( roars ) You're right-- I did love you. ( squelches ) Ah! But there are things in life bigger than love. ( wood breaks ) Ah! You fight with passion. Your father would have been proud to see it. Don't worry, I will tell him all about it. ( whimpers ) Yah! Ah! ( floorboards creak ) Deva :  Daddy. Hey. Hey, I thought that you and Max were over at the Frears' pool. Yeah, I got bored. Max is fine. He's playing with Sammy. Dad, what is going on? Well, that-- that's not an easy question to answer. Did you and Mom have a fight? No, no, no, baby. No, no, it's not like that. Jesus, you're smoking pot? Yes, I am. You know, sometimes when the pain in my shoulder gets bad, the only thing that works is a little bit of really good weed. It's not something that would help me get reelected, so I'm very careful about it. Your Iraq wound? Yeah. Hey. Here's the thing-- I don't want you to lie to me... but I'm not really dying for you to tell me the truth either. Just-- just promise me that everything's gonna be all right. Shh, shh, shh. ( kisses ) ( crying ) Everything's gonna be all right. Olek :  Mm. Hey! ( speaking Ukrainian ) ( Carrie speaking Ukrainian ) Both : Mwah! ( chuckles ) ( mimics Ukrainian ) What does that mean? It means "With God's help..." Mm-hmm. "...we will drink together again." When will you learn to speak Ukrainian? Eh? I'll speak Ukrainian when you can sing the "Star-Spangled Banner," okay? Ooh. Eh, I can sing the "Star-Spangled Banner." Listen to this. Okay, listen to this. Do it, do it. ♪ Oh, beautiful America ♪ ♪ God bless thee, America... ♪ The song "God Bless America." No, that's f*ckin', um-- that's like "America the Beautiful." You're not even trying to speak Ukrainian. Listen. ♪ America... ♪ A toast. Budmo. Lucas and Carrie : Hey. Budmo. Hey! Budmo! Heeey! All : Heeey! What does budmo mean anyway? It means... "We shall live forever." I'll drink to that. ( kisses ) Get out. Get dressed and get the hell out of my house. Why are you doing this? What's wrong? Get out. Get the f*ck out of my house. Stop it. You're hurting me! I'm hurting you? You f*ckin' whore. I opened my house to you. I took you in. No. Why are you doing this? You're not here two hours and you're already out there f*cking someone. That's not what happened. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying! ( crying ) Uncle Kai, wait. Please. I'm sorry. I lost my home today. I miss my family. I know I don't belong there anymore, but still... I don't know where I belong anymore. I know you know how that felt. I do. And there's a part of you that will never stop feeling like that. The sheriff-- you can have nothing to do with him. He's no one to me. I'm so sorry. I just-- I've never been on my own before. You're not on your own. ( kisses ) ( footsteps approaching ) Hello, Anastasia. I've missed you. ( groans ) Leave me alone. You are alone. You have been alone ever since you betrayed me. And now you have betrayed your husband, your children. Tell me, is there anyone in your life you have not betrayed? No, that's not true. That's not... My sweet, lost daughter. You have been lying for so long, you have no idea what truth is anymore. You've always been such a stubborn child,  so certain you knew best. Yes? And look at you now--  broken, bleeding, finished. No. Even now you fight when the fight is already lost. My poor, broken Anastasia. My name is Carrie. No! ( grunts ) ( whimpers ) Olek. Ana. Budmo. Hey. Budmo. Hey. Budmo. ( squelches ) ( groans ) ( grunts ) ( phone ringing ) Come on, Ana, pick up. ( ringing continues ) God damn it. Ana! Ana. Ana. Ana, baby. Open your eyes. No, no, no, no. Baby. Come on. Come on. f*ck. Jesus. Ana, open your eyes. Ana. Oh, Jesus Christ, don't you f*ckin' do this to me. No. You come back to me now. You come back. Ana. Open your eyes. Come on. ( coughs ) Yes. Ana, Ana. Ana. It's Carrie. ( laughing ) You're okay. You're okay. Come on. Come on. Oh, Jesus. Okay, okay. ( woman moans ) ( faint sirens ) Lucas :  Just hold on, baby. ( woman breathing deeply ) Olek :  We shall live forever. ( children laughing ) ( monitor beeping slowly ) ( respirator hissing ) ( man chanting ) ( rattling ) ( monitor beeping ) ( sustained tone )
