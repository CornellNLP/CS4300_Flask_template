 Ah! 
 [shotgun cocks] [panting] What's up, Hondo? You guys got nothing on me. You killed a cop. Allegedly. And then you bragged about it. Hondo : So arrest me, sweetheart. All right? You got nothing tying me to that nigger friend of yours. Okay, why don't you see if you can make it stick? No. You killed our friend. We're not gonna arrest you. What are you talkin' about? You're right, we couldn't make it stick. You're f*cking cops, okay? Arrest me. See any badges? You're the f*ckin' sheriff! Allegedly. Oh, fu... [clicking] [theme music playing] <b>3x01 - "The Fire Trials"</b> [breathing heavily] [grunting] Where do you go? What do you mean? It's like... you can't even look at me. It's nothing like that. You know, maybe you should really think about getting a new place. Eh, it has a certain old-school charm, no? No. [laughs] Well, you can't beat the rent. I mean, I get that this isn't a relationship, and I'm fine with that. [laughs] I have to go to work. You could at least hire a cleaning service or something. I don't like people touching my things. Your things? Yeah. [laughs] These aren't your things. Okay, time to get up. This is where Sugar's old crap goes to die. Yeah, this coming from the girl who lives in an Airstream. You just seem like somebody who could use a friend is all I'm saying. We're just two adults having s*x in a motel room. [sighs] You know what? f*ck it. [laughs] Come here. Great s*x. Always room for improvement. [chatter] Hey, Carrie, you're early. I couldn't sleep. Man : Order up. Eggs Benedict, hold the sauce. Man, you guys. Waitress : Take the back five, okay? You got it. Who had an eggs Florentine? [clattering] You want some eggs? No, thanks. You hear that? What? Quiet. You missing Job? No. I'm just sayin' how nice and quiet it's been since you got back from your little trip to New York last month. You got a problem with quiet? On the contrary. I'm gonna miss it when it's gone. [knocks] Kai : Yes? In regards to the matter we discussed, you should come down to the basement. Now? Yes. [footsteps approaching] Is he ready to talk? Looks like you two made quite a night of it. I know, I know. Burton's interview style can be a little rigid at times, but he's very precise. These cuts will all heal. You just make sure you live long enough to let that happen. Do you understand? Good. Now, has Jim Cage been supplying Philadelphia with Molly? Yeah. And he's been selling to Frazier exclusively? They cut your prices. He's got the whole territory locked up. Thank you for your cooperation. Wait! [man panting] Please. Please help me. Pl... [laughs] That's not really my thing. Stay the f*ck away from me! [chatter] Fruit platter and oatmeal with soy milk. And an egg white omelet. Hi, Carrie. How are you? How are the kids? Everyone's great. Thanks. Woman : Eggs over easy. Side of bacon, crisp. Thank you. I give her a lot of credit. It can't be easy, huh? You okay? Yeah. Lucas : Mr. Proctor. Sheriff, Deputy. Charging me with unlicensed firearms. That was the best you could do? Eh, just getting the ball rolling till I can charge you with the Longshadow murder. I'm sure you are, but thanks to you I have an airtight alibi, don't I? You had me locked up, remember? The way I see it, a guy like you, I'll get another shot. Yeah, but your track record isn't exactly giving me much cause for concern. See you around, Kai. I still come in every day expecting to see Emmett there. Yeah, me, too. Hey, morning. Hey. Raven. Uh... listen, I know that I... have some pretty big shoes to fill here. Huge. Yeah, yeah, I get that. But all I did was answer an ad. I'm sorry. This can't be easy for you. It's not, but it gets my family off the reservation. And I gotta tell you after working six years for KPD, it's great to be working in an actual functioning police station. "Functional." That's us. [knocks] Hey, Hood, you got a minute? Uh, yeah. What's up? Hondo file. Medical examiner said they're not gonna send out for ballistics on the bullets. They're prioritizing, I guess. And I... I canvassed the area. No one seems to have seen anything. So, basically, the official consensus is three anonymous shooters did the world a favor and nobody's gonna lose any sleep over a dead neo-Nazi with multiple priors. So... Sounds good to me. Okay. Something else? Are you even fazed by this? We executed a man, Hood. He killed one of us. I know that. I understand. You've done this sort of thing before? What? Killed a man? No, executed him. Brock... you'll be okay. Now let's go. Let's just not make a habit of it, okay? I... [birds chirping] [distant dog barking] Does Father know that we've been meeting like this? To what end? You don't think he'll join us, do you? But you would think at one point he'd want to know what became of his son. Let's be honest, Kai. Who you've become is exactly what he is afraid of. How is my granddaughter doing? She's fine. [wings fluttering] [shouting] Man : Hit him! [grunting] [people cheering] The fire trials are a sacred Redbone tradition to prove yourself a worthy leader. Times have changed and the Redbones must change with them. Wrong. [phone ringing] [ringing continues] Sheriff's Department. Billy. Billy. You have to press that interface button first in order to pull the call off Alma's switchboard. Thanks. Got it? Yeah. Time and experience, son. [phone rings] Brock : Interface. [ringing] Brock : There you go. Sheriff's Department. Deputy Lotus stepped away for a moment. Can I help you? Do you see him now? Are all your doors locked? Can you check them for me, please? And tell me your address. Got it. Okay, we're on our way, ma'am. Okay, we got a prowler call. Lady said there's a guy hiding in her shrubbery in her backyard. Whoa, whoa. Is it 63 Oakwood Lane? Yeah. How'd you know? Time and experience, son. I'll get it. We should both go... No, no, I need you to stay here and hold down the fort, all right? Times have not changed. We are still being raped and plundered by the white man like we have been for 500 years. What exactly is it you think we're going to celebrate? You left, Chayton. I'm in charge. I understand. Do you? I don't want to fight you. I don't want to fight you, either, but that's how we do it unless you see another way, Chayton. You could just step down. Would you? [grunting] [war cry] Chayton : Had enough? Yeah. Yeah. [grunting] We done? Yeah. We are here, all of us, to fight in a war that we will never win because it was lost by our people centuries ago. We will never reclaim our country. But I've come back because I'd rather die fighting than to live like a slave in my own land. It's time we took something back. Hello? Another prowler, huh? Gotta stop it with these prowler calls, Emily. All right? Look, what if I was out when Billy Raven took that call? Who the hell's Billy Raven? New deputy. Oh. Poor Emmett. I gotta get back. Just have a drink with me. Em, I'm on duty. You're always on duty. That's why we got divorced. No, we got divorced because you were f*cking Elliot Granger. I was f*cking Elliot Granger because you were never home. Classic chicken and the egg debate. Just sit with me. Please? [sighs] I just get lonely sometimes. Well, maybe you shouldn't drink alone at night. Done. To us. Yeah. [glasses clink] How's everything? How's... How's work and... You don't have to make small talk with me. Come on. Stop it. Stop, stop. Damn it, Em. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. [crying] Then make me okay. Damn it. [panting] f*ck me. [laughing] Harder. [giggling] [laughing] [both moaning] Oh! [gasps] Did it hurt? I mean, at first when they jab you with the needle it hurt a lot, but, I don't know, after a while you just kind of get used to it. Kind of like my life. [chuckles] Did your dad find a new place yet? Yeah, he's renting this shitty little apartment. It's pretty depressing, actually. Are he and your mom, like, talking? Sometimes, yeah. The whole thing is just so f*cked up. I bet they freaked when they saw your tat. They're way too caught up in their own bullshit to pay any attention to me. I know where we can get some premium bud for, like, 50 bucks. You have 50 bucks? Tapped out. No sh1t. You're always tapped out. Bite me. I have an idea. [music playing] ♪ Why can't you find... ♪ [laughs] Holy sh1t. ♪ ...your way back home? ♪ It's like a stoner's Toys "R" Us. ♪ Your way back ♪ 
♪ Your way back home? ♪ 
♪ Your way back ♪ 
♪ Your way back home? ♪ All right, guys. Guys, come on. Come on! ♪ Your way back home? Doing a little late-night shopping? You two, head home now. Consider this your last warning. Is he joking? You guys, just... just get out of here. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine. Just go! Hey! Leave the stuff. So, you wanna be a thief now? A little piece of advice. It's harder than you think. Your first mistake was your numbers. Every extra person increases your chances of getting caught and you had three people on a one-man job. It's not a great start. Come with me. You see an alarm on the door, window? Nope? So how did I get here so fast? See that little white box up there? It's a sound sensor. You break the glass, that triggers a silent alarm. 10 seconds later, my office is on the radio, here I am. Your only option with glass is a cutter. So this is it, huh? Jackpot. How much you got? $37. Lucas : Wow. See, the register is also connected to the alarm. So you would've been better to take the whole thing and open it when you got clear. Although, if there is any real cash left overnight...  it's gonna be in the safe, which is also bolted to the floor. So unless you know how to crack a safe... No? Well, then there's really nothing in here worth getting arrested for. Unless, of course, that was the point. You think I wanted to get caught? Self-destruction runs in the family. A little soon to be making daddy jokes, don't you think? You never know until you try. 
 
 [distant train horn blaring] [rustling] To your health. I don't know what you've been up to, but, uh... I just had s*x with my ex-wife. Again. [sighs] I know, I know, I know. But you know what? I know what you're gonna say and you've never been divorced, so... Hey, look, I wanted to tell you... we took care of Hondo. Oh, man, we made him pay for what he did to you. I doubt you'll be running in the same circles up there or wherever, but... if you happen to run into him, that was us. I know, I know, you probably have some Bible verse about leaving revenge to God, but, you see, Emmett, sometimes you cannot wait for God to put the world to right because while you're waiting, the world just keeps going to sh1t. And when you have a guy like Hood leading the charge, well, God's just gonna have to move a lot faster if He wants to keep up and you can tell Him I said that. I miss you. Cheers. What are you doing here? I stopped by to see the kids, found them here alone, so I decided to stay and have dinner with them. Where's Deva? She went to bed hours ago, Carrie. It's past midnight. I had to work late. You know, somehow I don't think you were at the diner. Well, you know, a lot of single mothers have to work two jobs. This has to stop! Let's not do this. Isn't the whole point of getting a divorce so we don't have to fight? How can you not realize that you are risking the well-being of your children? What is it with you? Some sort of addiction or something? You would know. I'm sorry. So you and Mom way back when. Yeah. But not anymore? No. How come you left her? I mean, she was pregnant. She should have found you. She should have told you. No, no. It wasn't her fault. There was no way she could have got to me without putting herself, and you... in a lot of danger. Then after she met your father,  she did what was best for you. The point is... why don't you take it easy on your mom? She lied to me my whole life. No, she tried to keep you safe. She left everything. Her whole life. Gave it all up. Everything. She did that for you. When did you know about me? The first time I saw you. You came here for her? But I stayed for you. Hi, Dad. Hey, I saw you go to bed... Woke up. Deva? This is not okay. Yeah, tell me about it. Where'd you find her? She was just out with some other kids. Yeah, well, thanks for bringing her back. Yeah. Have a good night. Hood. You know, Carrie promised to tell me everything, but when it came to you... nothin'. Whatever your secrets are, they were worth breaking a promise to her husband. You ended my marriage. Please...  leave me my daughter. I don't care who made her. I'm her... I'm her father. I'm asking you, please. [engine starts] [music playing] [men cheering] This is what we took in last night. And if you click here, you can see the same day last week, last month, and last year. You click here, you can see what each girl is bringing in. Okay. Anyway, I think this is enough for tonight. Why don't you check on the club? I'll finish up a few things here. [music playing] [gasps] Chayton : Proctor had his hands in Longshadow's pockets. One thing leads to another. Now Longshadow is dead. We'll be coming for you, white girl. You... and Proctor. Soon. [aircraft roaring] [chatter over P.A.] [radio chatter] Man : Come on, come on. Let's go! Who the hell is that? This is a United States Marine Corps vehicle. Step aside... [tires screeching] TOC, kilo-one-niner. Taking hostile contact on Pondfield 15. Requesting... We don't have time to wait for backup. Get us out of here. [tires screeching] M*therf*ckers. [gunfire] [shouts] Siobhan over radio : Just got a report of shots being fired on Pondfield Road. Pondfield Road, that's near Camp Genoa. Could be running exercises. Not without notifying us. Siobhan, we're close by. We're on it. [gunfire] [shouts] Marine : Jackson, you okay? Jackson, answer... Got him. [gunshot] [police siren wailing] [gunshots] [man shouts] Man : Come on, let's go! Man #2 : Move it, move it! Alma, we need backup! EMS, we got multiple casualties! Repeat, multiple casualties! Are you worried about the Indian? He knew. How could he know? They would naturally suspect my involvement. Who pulled the trigger is not important to them. It seemed pretty important to him. You know, I'm gonna put a guard in the house. Anywhere you go, Burton will go with you. That Indian won't get near you again. Morning, Sheriff. Morning. How can I help you, sir? Who's the CO here? Colonel Stowe, sir. Okay, well, I need to see him. You have an appointment to see the colonel? You just told me his name. How could I have an appointment? Soldier : No one gets on base without authorization. There were four Marines killed on the road earlier today, about eight miles from here. I'm sure you heard about it. Yes, sir. Well, this is a homicide investigation. That's my authorization. Stowe : Sheriff Hood. Colonel Stowe. I've been expecting you. Not according to your men at the gate. They were just following protocol. This way. Hey, Colonel. Let me just start by saying how sorry I am. It's a tragedy. Nine tours in Iraq and Afghanistan between 'em, and they get killed demilling an antiquated base in Banshee, Pennsylvania. I have no idea how I'm gonna talk their families through that one. Colonel Douglas Stowe. [beeps, clicks] [chatter] So you're shutting the place down? We're basically clearing house for all the contraband that gets shipped out of the war zones. Guns, valuables, drugs, you name it. And cash. Your tax dollars at work. Whether we're buying guns off the streets to keep them from the Taliban or sending out soldiers with briefcases full of money to pay off informants. We've got half of Afghanistan on the damn payroll. The money we don't use has to be inventoried and sent back to the Fed to be wasted in the next war. Right. You don't agree? I don't like war. But when you ask me to fight, let me fight. So the four Marines who were killed, they were transporting cash? No, we don't move cash in trucks. We contract armored vehicles for that. Those were mostly confiscated automatic weapons. AKs and M4s headed to a Fed facility to be destroyed. Great, so now the Redbones are armed like the Taliban. I'm sorry, the Redbones? Yeah. The guys who jacked your truck. They're a tribal gang from the reservation. Do you have a list of everything that was in those crates? I do. Great, well, if you could just have one of your people print that out for me, then... Sheriff Hood, I appreciate the visit and the fact that you and your deputies tried your best to stop these people. But the moment they killed my Marines and stole government property, this became a matter for the military. NCIS will lead the investigation with the FBI and the BIA. Now, that's a lot of f*ckin' letters, and the last thing you want is be getting caught up in the middle of it. That's true, but those guns may end up on the streets of my town. And if they do, you feel free to shoot back. We got four dead Marines here. No one's gonna have the patience for a small-town sheriff who thinks he knows better. Okay. Thanks for your time. Captain Murphy here will show you out. Thanks again for coming by. You don't look like a Marine, Captain Murphy. [over phone] Sugar here. You know that one big job we've been looking for? Well, I think I found it. Do tell. The Marine base, Camp Genoa. They're moving cash by the truckload. Millions of dollars. If they're moving military grade security systems. Yeah, if only we knew someone who could hack into the military network. Man : It's been 25 minutes. [gun clicks] You should be in by now. You try working with a m*therf*ckin' hand cannon in your face. This here is the New York Stock Exchange. There's a lot of moving parts. Well, then, make them move a little bit faster. The trick ain't gettin' in. The trick is gettin' out without anyone knowing you've been there. That's of no concern to me. [computer beeps] Job : There. That's it? You're in? Oh, no, that's just the signal. Signal? What signal? [gunfire] Damn it, he got the f*ckin' money! Go get him. Have you seen me run? Bullshit! ♪ I'm always in a greasy kind of love, ooh ♪

You know, I'm actually starting to believe in God? And I'm thinkin' that m*therf*cker hates me. [chuckles] Yeah, well, I got something might cheer you up. I highly doubt that. What the f*ck, Job? Hold on. Is this all the money? m*therf*cker sat on his own grenade! Damn. I ain't coming back to Pennsylvania. I just had eyes on eight to 10 million in unwashed U.S. dollars. [tire explodes] [glass shattering] I hate you. You know that? I f*ckin' hate you. I see you met the "Duck Dynasty" guys. Yeah. Don't worry, I'll sanitize the booth when they leave. Here you go. What can I get you guys to eat? How about a deluxe burger and your phone number? [all laugh] I don't have a phone. That's all right. We don't have to talk. You're gonna want to move that hand. How's that? Man : Yeah. Does that feel good? Sure does. Yeah? Hope it was worth it. Worth what? [groans] How do you want that burger cooked? Hi. So what happened? He grabbed my ass. So you broke his nose? Do you really think you're the right person to be lecturing me? Yeah, 'cause right now I'm the only friend you've got. So I'll ask you one more time. What's going on with you? I'm a f*cking waitress. I'm getting divorced and my kids look at me like they don't know me anymore. And I'm getting groped by inbred freaks. f*cking look at me. Go home. I'll clean this up. So this is the one, huh? Yeah. I don't know. A military base. [chuckles] Sounds risky. Anything worthwhile usually is. And it's being decommissioned. What about Job? He said he'd think about it. I don't think he's coming back here. Look at you, Sugar, already trying to cut me out. [laughs] Is that your driving outfit? Yes, it is. And fortunately it's also my "don't take any sh1t" outfit. So whatever it is you thinking about sayin', swallow it and pour me a f*ckin' whiskey. [chuckles] If I start drinkin' now, maybe I'll be drunk enough to handle this town in daylight. Sugar : Gentlemen... Camp Genoa. Camp Genoa. You know, my whole way over here, I just kept thinking, "I can't believe I'm coming back to this shithole to mix it up with the f*ckin' Marines." Well, it's not the Marines I'm worried about. It's the mercs. The mercs? You didn't say nothing about no motherfuck... What kind of mercs?! Well, the bad kind. I'd say ex-Navy SEALs if I had to guess. I don't believe this sh1t. What is it with you? Is it a death wish? Is that what it is? Because if it is, why don't you go out and get yourself killed?! Why do you always want to get me killed with you?! It's a lot of money. It's f*cking soldiers with guns. Big f*cking guns. We ain't talking about rent-a-cops. We ain't even talkin' about real cops. We talkin' about f*ckin' commandos. They'll never see us com... Uh-uh, nope! Tell me about the money. [man chanting] [music playing] ♪ Follow me, love ♪
