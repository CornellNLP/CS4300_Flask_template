 [music playing] 
 Siobhan : What you're thinking about? Hood : I was thinking about something... someone said to me the other day. I mean, you get used to a certain way of being. And... you think we are who we are What, you mean people like you? Well, me, you, people in general. Siobhan : I don't know if anyone ever changes, really, but we can evolve, right? I mean, that's what we're trying to do, isn't it? Just become... better versions of ourselves. [gunfire] Get down! [ricochet bullets] Get down! [women screaming] Hood! [clicking] [theme music playing] 3x05 - "Tribal" [moaning] Shh. Medicine will help the pain.[/i] [moaning] [labored breathing] Kai... Forgive me, Kai. If I had only been stronger, I could have saved you. Could have saved us both. Kai, where are you? It's Emily. You need to come home now. [gunfire] Stay down. Where are you going? Can't let them get inside. Alma, you good? I think so. All right, stay down. [gunshots] [shouting] Aaaargh! [shouting] [gasping] Alma, get on the radio! Radio's fried. Try the landline. [panting] The phones are dead. And they're jamming cells, too. Keep trying. Hood! Hood! [woman coughing] Hey, you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Raven? All good. Everyone else okay? Brock : Yeah. All : Yeah. Okay. Siobhan, you okay? I'm okay. Brock : No blood. No blood. You okay? [groans] I... I understand that my physical appearance may be unsettling, but... never mind. Who the hell was that? I thought he was with you. Sheriff, get me out. Shut the f*ck up. Man #1 : Lock and load and regroup. Next one, move! Man #2 : Gather the weapons. [hits outside] Brock. See if we can get you some water. Yeah? Get me out of is goddamn cage right now! Shut up, Proctor. If you haven't noticed, we got a bit of a situation. I have no cover in here! You've got the same cover we all have. If I wanted to get in here, those gates wouldn't stop me. Well, it's a good thing you're already in here. Hey, it's the Redbones. They're spread out in the parking lot and across the street. We just need to hold them off till the state police get here. No, they're not coming. Phones are down. Cells, too? Yeah. Oh, sh1t. All right, so we're basically on our own against a homicidal maniac and a dozen thugs armed like a platoon. That about sums it up. What the f*ck do they want? I don't know, but whatever it is, we're not gonna like it. They want me. I killed Tommy. I don't give a f*ck what Chayton wants. He's not getting it. Raven, Siobhan, get these civilians down to the basement. Okay, folks. Come with us. We're gonna take you someplace safe. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What the hell's goin on out there? I'm guessing these gates thrill them. And they're regrouping, figuring out their next move. What's our next move? [gunfire] [ricochets on steel] I don't know how long those gates are gonna last. We need more firepower. Go down to the armory, get everything you can. Is this enough? I hope you don't mind, Sheriff, I took some initiative. Figured there was no time to waste. You're the guy who gave me your resume, right? Dade County Sheriff's Department. Yes, sir. Kurt Bunker. How the hell did you get into our gun locker, Bunker? I smashed the lock. You're hired. What? Thank you, sir. Get those guns handed out. Seriously... Hood... What? What about Mr. Proctor? What about him? Keeping him in that cell is a violation of a civil liberty. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. Sheriff, are you gnna let him out or not? Not. Okay, so the sheriff is willfully endangering the life of my client. You're an officer of the court. Do something. This is a war zone, Counselor. Due process just got blown up. Hey, Sperling, I got an idea. Why don't you go down the basement? I'm not fuckining anywhere with without Mr. Proctor. Okay, Bunker, give him a gun. What? Why? Time to make yourself useful. I don't know how to shoot that thing. Well, neither do I, but it's not gonna stop me. Ma'am, that gun packs a powerful kick. Are you gonna stand there like a total misogynist and patronize me, or are you gonna show me how to shoot the damn thing? Thank you. I just felt married again. All right, here we go. Magazine goes right in here, all right? Make sure the safety is off, one goes into the chamber and just point, squeeze. Repeat as necessary. Hood, the basement. What about it? The exterior doors don't have gates on them. Bunker, through the range down the stairs. I'm on it. Sir. Alison, with him... I'm not going anywhere with that guy. With all due respect, ma'am, I understand my physical appearance may be alarming... Save it. I've known men like you. I know everything about you. Hey, if you want to help people, there's people down there who need your help. Then let the Nazi calm them down. I'm asking you. Fine. But keep your distance and I am new with this thing, so it might just accidentally go off. [sighs] Fair enough? Yes, sir. Citizens secure in the basement. What do we do now? All right, spread out, settle in. You shoot anything that comes through those gates. [gun cocks] Chayton : Hood! Hood! I'm listing. You've got Billy Raven and Proctor in there. Send them both out with Nas and Tate,  and we'll spare the rest of you. Let me think about it. You got two minutes. Sheriff you are not seriously  considering handing Mr. Proctor over to that psychopath? Relax, Jackson. I'm sure the sheriff hasn't forgotten that night much like this one when he could've died if not of my intervention. Huh, Sheriff? Hey, Chayton. Can't do it. You won't get another chance. Is that right? Tell you what. You leave now, I'll let you live. We are coming in there, cop. Maybe, but if you do, more Redbones are gonna die. Wasn't your little brother enough? Shut your mouth, white boy. You know, you really should have protected him more. I'm gonna make you suffer. Hey, Chayton. f*ck off. [grunting] [metal clanging] If those gates come down, we won't last long. How much ammo we got left? [sighs] Not enough. Sheriff, let me talk to Chayton. [sighs] He doesn't want to talk to you, Billy. He wants to kill you. I could end this. Lucas : What, by sacrificing yourself? It's tribal justice. No, it's bullshit... what it is. We go down, we go down together. [thud] Brock : Well, this sucks. Who needs a light? Siobhan? I got one in my drawer. Brock : Billy? You got it? Raven : Got it. Hey, Brock! Here, take it. Go. Where's the emergency lights? We don't have emergency lights. Lucas : Perfect. Brock : f*ck. Stay down. Siobhan : sh1t. Proctor : You're wasting your time. At some point Chayton is gonna wise up  and he's gonna pull those gates off the hinges. And then he's gonna eat you alive. I could always send you out there as an appetizer. Yeah. Well, I'd rather fight for my life out there than wait in the dark to die like the rest of you. He's got a point. Brock : Hood, listen. Yeah? There's a backup generator in the basement. Won't power everything, but it'll buy us some light. I'll go. Okay. [door closes] [steps on stairs] Who's there? Siobhan. Alison : They took out the lights. They're trying to mess with our heads. Well, it's working. All right, listen. Someone heard that gunfire. Okay? So the state police, they're on the way. Till they get here, I need you to hang tight. Can you do that? Yeah. Good. Siobhan, take care of that generator. All quiet? So far, sir. You always so polite? Only when I'm nervous. [sighs] Hang in there, Bunker. Yes, sir. [sloshes] Oh, sh1t. Out of gas? Almost. Here, hold this. [sputtering] [grunts] God damn it. Here, let me try. No, I got it! Come on. I said I got it! [sputters] [sighs] This f*cking day just keeps getting worse. How do you think I feel? I was about to retire. You're an asshole. Yeah. You don't even know what you're doing here. You're not even a cop. No, I'm not. Then why the f*ck are we all listening to you? You know what? You're right. But I've been in tighter spots than this... and I'm still here. So I need you to trust me. Ha! Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? Yes. I don't want to die tonight. You're not going to. We're all walking out of this together. Let's try it again. [humming] [sighs] Brock : Oh, thank God. This isn't the first time this has happened, you know? I mean, one army of guys with machine guns would be bad enough. But two? I mean, that's just... Bad luck? No, it's something else. Jesus. - Hey. Hey. Here. Thank you. Thanks. It's so quiet in here. You think they left? Chayton's not going anywhere. Not till he gets what he wants. No, they'll make a move soon. Wish I had... [gunfire] [shouting] [grunts] [shouting] Sperling! What the hell are you doing?! I'm getting my client out of harm's way. Give me the keys, Jackson. Blow me. Get down! sh1t! Give me the f*cking keys, Jackson! f*ck off, Alison. Give me the f*cking keys! [screaming] [gasping] [coughing, choking] [coughing] [gunshot] [gasping] Al! Al! Hey, hey. Come on. Come on. [coughing] Where's Raven? Brock, where's Raven? In there. Raven! Yeah? Cover me! Down! Down! Come on, move! Take cover! Let's get this hole covered up. Where's Proctor? Apparently his lawyer got him an early release. What? Help me. Help me. Come on. [coughing] [sighs] Those aren't gonna hold them off for long. No, but it's better than nothing. [car engine starts] [engine revving] [chains clanking] What is that? I don't know. Stay here. Hook it up. Let's do it. [pounds car] [tires squealing] [tires squealing] [gate rattling] We gonna have a problem? No, not tonight. 
 
 [Leah speaking Pennsylvania Dutch] As we forgive those who trespass against us. [Leah speaking Pennsylvania Dutch] And lead us not into temptation. [speaking Pennsylvania Dutch] Emily : But deliver us from evil. Emily : Thine is the kingdom. [speaking Pennsylvania Dutch] The power and the glory. [speaking Pennsylvania Dutch] Forever and ever. Amen. [gate rattling] [tires squealing] Go! Go! [men shout] Stand clear! Move! Move! Put it out! I can feel you looking at me. Are you okay? I'm fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, really? Right. I guess you've changed. Yes. People don't change. When I was 16, I watched my father beaten into a coma by two men who looked just like you. Do you have any idea what that feels like? To watch your father helpless and bleeding,  begging two thugs to spare his only daughter. They didn't. You know, spare me. So tell me, Bunker, what fills a man with so much hate  that he has to permanently paint it all over his body? Announce to the world that he hates something that much? My father was the biggest man I ever knew. He beat me a lot when I was a kid, so I stayed away from home as much as possible. I had a stutter, a really bad one, so I didn't talk much either. There was this guy in our neighborhood, Tank. Big and badass and covered in tattoos. And every time he saw me, he would sit me down and buy me a soda. Tell me that I had the power to change things. Introduced me to his buddies. They were the only people that... made me feel like I mattered. One day, my father gave me a black eye. I don't remember why, but Tank saw it. He marched me home, he grabbed my father by the throat, made him apologize. Made him promise he would never do it again. He said, "Your boy is one of us now." My father never laid a hand on me again. For the first time in my life... I had power. And before I knew it... I had become one of them. That is no goddamn excuse. I know that. I know that. [panting] Drop it, Proctor! No, Brock, it's okay. The hell it is. Now drop your weapon. Drop it! Get that f*cking gun out of my face! I said drop it! I'm on your side! Hey, hey, hey! The fight's out there. An hour ago, I stopped you from braining this asshole with a f*cking hammer. Now you're letting him do whatever the hell he wants? No. Not in my house. It's not your house. It is my f*cking house! Don't you f*cking touch me. [lights humming] Hey. You gave Proctor a goddamn gun. Are you kidding me? He had the gun. I gave him some ammo. Why? Because we need all the help we can get. No, no, no. I don't want his help. I don't need his help. I want that murderer locked up in a cell. That's what I need. It was my call and I made it. Yeah, of course it was your call. You know, forget the law, forget the rules. Just make it up as you go, huh? Hey, just calm down. No, f*ck that! No... People are dying and any one of us could be next. Listen to me. No, you know what? The fact is you go off half-cocked whenever it suits you and the rest of us just have to fight your battles. Well, I'm done. I've had it, I'm not listening to you anymore. All right, fine. Give me your f*ckin' badge. My badge? You know, before you got here, I did this job by the book. I put in my time, I sacrificed my marriage for this job because I'm good at it. I'm good at being a cop. Being good at killing people doesn't make you right for this job. Is that right? 'Cause you're pretty f*cking good at doing that, too. Yeah. Yeah. I did. I tried. I tried, Hood. I tried doing things your way. I convinced myself it was for the best, but... everything you touch turns to blood. [music] Get everyone in the other room now! Go, go! Get out! Other room, go! Go, go, go! [gunfire] [groans] f*ck. Hey. Hey, you all right? Yeah, don't worry about me. Just cover the door. [humming] Brock's voice : People are dying. Everything you touch turns to blood. Siobhan : You don't even know what you're doing here. You're not even a cop. I'm going out there. What the hell are you talking about? Someone's gotta make sure help is on the way. Hood, it's suicide! He's right, you'll die out there. You can barely even stand. We can't hold them off forever. Find another way. I'll go. Once we're clear, I'll call for help. You won't get clear. You'll be dead inside of 30 seconds. Well, either way you win, Deputy. You know what? You're under arrest, Proctor. You don't get to just walk out this door. Desperate times. Right, Sheriff? Godspeed. If I don't make it outta here, you stay the f*ck away from Rebecca. Okay. If I do make it, you and I have unfinished business. Yeah, I know. Don't forget to make that call. [gunfire] [gunfire stops] Come on. Let's go. Let's block up this door. [Leah humming] [humming continues] It's not too late, Rebecca. Leave this house. Find your own way. [humming] Find your own way. [humming continues] Raven's covering the bullpen. Brock's downstairs watching the door with Bunker. Okay. You think Proctor made it? I do. What we had... was any of it real? All of it. Are you sure? How long were you locked up? 15 years. [sighs] Oh, my God. And then you come here and Carrie's got Gordon and the kids. That's right. [music] And now? Would you really just have walked away? If that's what you want. What if it isn't? Then we leave together. Do I know everything about you? Not yet. But if you want to... you will. Okay. Start by telling me your real name. [lights humming] [Native American chanting] Billy. What the hell are you doing?! [grunting] I'm ending this. Get away from there! I have to do this. It's the only way. Chayton! Raven. This has to end. Chayton : You know what it'll take. Blood for blood. I'll give myself up. You call off your men. You leave these people alone. The time for negotiating has passed. They'll all pay now. For Christ's sakes. Haven't you killed enough people already?! [grunts] Come on. Come on, Billy, we gotta get you outta here. [gunfire] Come on. Here, hold on. [gunfire continues] [groans] How bad? Just have to stop the bleeding. Can he stand? Yeah. Yeah. Get him up. Gotta go to the basement. [clattering] f*ck. Come on, come on, come on. No, just go. Just go, we'll be right behind you. No, come on. Just go. Go. We'll be okay. Okay. [groans] I can't control my legs. You're going into shock. You need to get downstairs. I'm not leaving you here. Siobhan. Come here. [gunfire] I killed Tommy. It's blood for blood. Billy, look at me. Listen. You saved my life at the Savoy. You're not gonna die for that. I have no ammo. Here. In case I don't get a chance, I just want to say... Don't do that. Do what? What you're about to do. I was just gonna say I still think I would have been a better sheriff than you. Yeah, you're probably right. [groans] [cell door opens] [gasps] [groans] [coughs] [grunts] [groans] [panting] Should we go after them? Help yourself. What... [choking] Let her go, Chayton. I said, let her go. [groans] God damn it, you let her go or I'll blow your f*cking head off! No. No. No, no, no, Chayton. Chayton. Just stop, okay? This has got nothing to do with her. All right? Please. Please. It's between you and me. Just let her go. [groans] Shh. No. Please. Shh. No. Please. Shh. Please. Please. [cracks] [lights humming] [sirens wailing] [Music] Mutter. [crying] Mutter. God, our Father... Your power brings us to birth. Your providence guides our lives. And by Your command, we return to dust. Lord, those who die Their lives change, but do not end. I pray and hope for my family, relatives, and friends,  and for all the dead known to You alone. In company with Christ, who died and now lives... Siobhan? ...may they all rejoice in His kingdom, Siobhan? Unite us together again in one family... Hey, hey. ...to sing His praise fever and ever. Amen. [whimpering] Oh, my... oh, my... oh, my...
