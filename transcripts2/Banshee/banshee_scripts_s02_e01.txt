 Rabbit : You and Anastasia. 
 I think he knows. 
 He doesn't know. 
 You will suffer.

 Who's there? 
 It's me.

 It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. [groans] f*ck. Hey. Hey. You're a mess. You get used to it. They found Rabbit yet? Not yet. If he's not dead... I know. What you did for Max... I did it for you. I know. Gordon? Yeah, he won't let me see them. We can get through this. I need to get my family back. Ana will always be a part of who I am. But I stopped living for her a long time ago. Carrie Hopewell. You really think that's who you are? I honestly don't know anymore. But they're my children. That hearing is coming up and God only knows where all this is gonna land. They know who I am now, but you can't afford to have your cover blown. I think it's time for you to disappear. I disappeared for 15 years. [music] ♪ And I would ♪

And as long as I said all the right things, I could be back in my bed tonight. I thought you had made peace with your decision to leave. I killed that man, the Mayor. You didn't know he was in there and neither did I. You really didn't know he was in there? I never lied to you, Rebecca, and I'm not gonna start now. You choose my world, you have to know there will be casualties. If you can't deal with that, then ... maybe you do belong back on the farm. [sighs] Okay. Okay what? Okay, let's go home.

How many times can you bury the same guy? We wouldn't be out here if your lazy ass had dug a deep enough hole the first time. Shut up and grab his feet. m*therf*cker doesn't even have feet. [theme music playing] [clicking] 2x01 - Little Fish [door opens] Agent Racine? Dean Xavier. You made good time. Not good enough. What do you have for me here? We got a couple of bodies that don't add up. We've got positive IDs on these two. Charles Randall and Delmont Munson. Should that mean something to me? No. They're local. But there was a third body that we found. Teeth missing, fingers filed. But two days after we dug him up, someone broke in here and stole the body. Sorry, you can't smoke in here. Turns out we were able to get some DNA samples  from the clothing that he was buried in. I've already sent the kit out. You're showing this to me why? Well, just thought it might be pertinent? These bodies date back, what, about three or four months? Coroner's got them at 16, 17 weeks. So long before Rabbit showed up here and everyone started shooting. Well, yes, but there's other things going on here. These two guys worked for Kai Proctor. I'm sorry, I forgot your name. Xavier. Dean Xavier. Agent Xavier, I didn't come out here to clean up all your messes. Just the one. Uh... [door opens] Deputy Emmett Yawners. Deputy Brock Lotus. Deputy Siobhan Kelly. Lucas Hood. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Special Agent Jim Racine. You all know Agent Xavier. Let me tell you how this is gonna work. This is a closed federal hearing in which you will be delivering sworn testimony, 'cause everyone knows swearing on a Bible keeps people honest. You do have a right to have an attorney present. And I should inform you that if you exercise that right, you will earn my immediate and eternal suspicion. I'll call you in one by one to answer questions. If you answer to my satisfaction, this will probably be the last time we see each other. I understand your Mayor recently suffered the misfortune of being blown up. This town is something else. I've asked Mr. Hopewell  to serve as a witness to these proceedings. As he's married to Mrs. Hopewell,  he's not exactly an objective party here. But since he will play no part in the resolution of these findings and since everyone in this town seems to be connected in some way to everyone else, I'm gonna let that slide. Any questions? No? Okay. Come on, let's get started. [Kai grunting] [woman breathing heavily] [recorder clicks] State your name for the record. Lucas Hood. You're the Sheriff? I am. Okay, then, Sheriff Hood,  why don't you tell me when you first came in contact with Mr. Rabbit. Some of his men shot up the Cadi. [gunfire] And you didn't kill the men who shot at you? Nope. So who did? No idea. And Rabbit was there? What do you want, Rabbit? To be the last face you ever saw. Yes. Although, at that point, I didn't know who he was. So just to be clear, at no point in your life before the events of that month had you met or spoken to or had any kinds of dealings with the gangster known as Rabbit? Correct. But he spent about 1,000 bullets, lost three men trying to kill you. Any idea why? No idea. You sticking with that story? Yes. Mrs. Hopewell, how would you characterize your relationship with the sheriff? I don't know. Cordial, I guess. So not to put too fine a point on it, were you f*cking him? Excuse me? Excuse my language. Were you involved in a sexual relationship with the sheriff? Of course not. It's been my experience that when a man puts himself through that kind of hell, it's a pretty safe bet that there's some s*x somewhere in the equation. So, just to clarify...  you weren't f*cking him? No. She told me that her father was a gangster,  that she had been hiding from him for years,  and that now he'd found her. In addition to asking for your help, she asked you to keep it a secret? Yes. Even from her husband? Yes. Which you did. Yes. Back in the day, before you went AWOL, there was a prevailing opinion on the organized crime desk that you were an integral part of the organization. Is there a question in there? No. No question at all. By your own account, he had you down there for a few hours. He must have said something. He said a lot of things. Sheriff Hood? Sheriff Hood? Excuse me? I asked you what some of those things were. What did Rabbit talk about? You took my only daughter from me. There are no words to express the pain. Sorry, I'm... I'm not 100% yet. Um... yeah. He spoke mainly in Russian. Ukrainian. Yeah, well, it's all Greek to me. Moving on. This business with the metalworks. What the hell was that about? We knew they had Sheriff Hood. And that he'd be killed very quickly if we didn't act. I see. And who told you that? Mrs. Hopewell. You just took her word for it? She was very convincing. She told us she a past with Rabbit which explained why he had taken her son earlier and that Sheriff Hood had traded himself for the boy. You often go into battles with civilians for backup? There were mitigating factors. We had to move immediately. I don't know. 13, 14 guys. I lost count. They were all using machine guns. I couldn't hear myself think. Brock : I'm out! First two caught me in my vest. Then I took one in the leg. [screams] We had no idea they'd be that heavily armed. There was a guy up on the stacks laying down cover fire with a machine gun. Who took him out? Mrs. Hopewell. Mrs. Hopewell. Mrs. Hopewell. Ah! Two shots... one to the chest, one somewhere around the neck. That must have been hard for you to shoot your own father. Good-bye, Daddy. Well, he kidnapped my son and threatened my family. My father was an evil and twisted man. No, he wasn't. He is an evil and twisted man. He's not dead. I shot him point-blank. Well, then I guess it was his corpse that got up and walked out of that building. I saw him go down. He couldn't have survived. And even if... He's not dead! [squeaking] [yelping] [crunches] [squirrel screaming] [screams] Racine : Normally we review testimony over a period of weeks. But if I've learned anything in my years of doing this, it's that bullshit will stay bullshit no matter how long. I think we've had our fill today. And fortunately after years of meetings, I have been granted the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. I think we can all agree that you all showed some monumentally bad judgment. At the same time, a group of hardened criminals was setting up shop in your town. Desperate times and so on. The bottom line is this town needs its sheriff's department. Lucas Hood, you were not on active duty on the night in question. You had surrendered your firearm and badge and were for all intents and purposes an endangered civilian. As far as I can tell, you weren't doing any of the shooting. As such, I've got no book to throw at you. Congratulations, you're the sheriff again. Deputy Lotus. You were in charge that night. As such, I'm gonna throw you under the bus. But you also got shot trying to rescue one of your own. That makes you something of a hero. So 18 months probation and a letter of censure in your jacket. Are you kidding me? You cannot come in here... ! You want to take this up the ladder, you go right ahead. The protocol breaches alone would be grounds for a criminal hearing. I don't know how the hell... ! You won the f*cking lottery with me today! And this is where a smart man would shut the hell up. Deputies Yawners and Kelly, 12 months probation. Either of you does anything that even raises an eyebrow in my office and you're unemployed. And the BSD will be under federal oversight for the next two years. Every arrest, every call, every traffic ticket will be subject to my review. So you had better make sure you do it all by the book. I've got to go. I'm late. How can you let them all off like that? There were two other civilians! The bartender had priors. You didn't even charge them. Local criminal elements are the sheriff's problem, not mine. But why are they any different than Mrs. Hopewell? Because they are not the daughters of a Ukrainian crime lord. The US Attorney's office authorized you to conduct a full-scale hearing... Oh, for f*ck's sake. Xavier, I've got bigger fish to fry. Your fish is dead! You're so obsessed with finding this Rabbit that you're losing sight... He's not dead! You'd have another body to show me. Rabbit's got a f*cking river of blood on his hands and you want to waste my time on small-town shenanigans? How are you gonna explain what you did in there to Washington? It won't hold up. It's Banshee, Pennsylvania! No one gives a sh1t! Let go of me. Look, I'll be dead pretty soon, Xavier. My cancer has got cancer. But I am going to spend some small amount of time on this planet... knowing that b*st*rd isn't on it. [sighs] And whatever his unresolved issues are here, I want them all right where they are so he can find them when he's ready. You're using them as bait? That's what you do with little fish. This is my case. No, your case was Proctor, who has somehow managed to be the only guy in this town not involved in this sh1t show. Seems to me, Agent Xavier, your mishandling of things here has led to a lot of dead bodies and a pretty serious amount of reckless endangerment. What the hell are you talking about? You can go down for this or you can take a reassignment. Oh, sh1t, I'm late. [pats] Pack your bags. You'll have new marching orders by tonight. 
 
 Mrs. Hopewell. As a civilian, you don't fall under the same federal statutes as the sworn members of law enforcement, so I'm turning your case over to the DA's office. You'll be charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and obstruction of justice, whatever other charges they can drum up in regard to your involvement on the night in question. They took my son. That is... unless you can shed some light on where Daddy might be holed up. If you were to aid in my investigation, then I might find a way to make those charges disappear. If I knew where he was, don't you think I would tell you? After everything I heard in there, I have no idea what you would or wouldn't do. You're a b*st*rd. I'd lawyer up, then. Good luck in court. Gordon. How's the leg? Ah, it's getting there. [clears throat] You believe this sh1t? What, after everything else, this is the part you find hard to believe? Hey, Gordon, I'm sorry. I know your family's been through a lot. Listen, if there's anything I can do... Well, maybe there is. I want you to keep an eye on Hood for me. Anything out of the ordinary, I want to be the first call you make. That's pretty much everything. Well, that's my point. Now you got a place to come to. [beeps, clicks] You gonna put that badge back on or what? I didn't want to rub it in. After what we went through to bring you back... damn well better wear it. Hey. Yeah? Thank you. Yeah, well... let's see how long you can stay out of trouble this time, huh? Job : We dodge a federal probe by the skin of our teeth and the first thing we do is go out and rob an armored truck? Carrie : Quit your whining and pop those doors. [grunts] Whoo! Flip that bitch! [laughing] Announcer over radio : ...floating high to deep center field! Come on, baby. Okay, let's go. Time. Okay, I'll be right behind you. What the hell is going on? We're being jacked. [tires screeching] [grunts] [grunting] Grab him. [gunshots] Oh, f*ck me. m*therf*cker! You hit 'em? [grunts] Ana, stay with them. What? Oh, don't even think about it, baby. No, we don't have f*cking time. f*ck! [grunts] Carrie : What is he doing? Job : God damn it! Get back in here. We're coming up on the split. I'm turning in three, two, one. [tires screeching] [laughing] [panting] Hi. Hi. Dude, I'm pretty sure this is the ugliest color. You like these? No? You can do better. I think these would be hot, though. Oh, my God, they match your hair. They're perfect. Uh, no, no. You're crazy. [laughs] All the boys would love that. My grandma would seriously wear these. Ew. Oh, I actually like these. Kind of cool. Those are hot. Yeah, I like these. You should get them. I don't know. I don't think I need them, right? Yeah. All right, I think we're good. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Excuse me, girls. Come here. What? What? Can I see what's in your bag? What do you want? f*ck my sh1t. [gunshot] Get down! sh1t! Who the f*ck is that? How the hell should I know? Well, will you shoot him already? Oh! Drive! Drive! Ah! [tries screeching] f*ck. Oh, sh1t. Carrie : Let's go. God damn it! That m*therf*cker can shoot. Okay, let's go. Go, go, go! [gunfire continues] Let's go, let's go! Go! Go, go! [tires squealing] Ah, sh1t. I love it when a plan comes together. Shut the f*ck up and drive. So you want the good news or the bad news first? What happened? Who the hell was that? I don't know. I thought you said you had this handled? It was. Maybe we should review your definition of "handled." The guards weren't tipped off or Job never would have made it past dispatch this morning. I don't know who that was, but it wasn't Kinaho security and it wasn't the cops. We got well over 100 grand here. It's not what we were going for, but it's something. All that planning, man, and we got rolled like a bunch of motherfucking amateurs. Yeah, how? Only the four of us knew. Well, no one here leaked anything, right? Could you have been hacked? First of all, f*ck you. Second of all, I ain't the one shaking off 15 years of mommy rust. Okay, I'm out of here. Call me when you've got my cut ready. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. What?! What are you so pissed about? I should have my head examined for doing this with you. Hey, you came to me. Don't forget that. We had this planned without you. And who would have done the driving? Come on, Ana. That's not my name. It's who you are. No, that's who you want me to be! If that's true, then why did you want in? I got fired, okay? By my best friend. And no one else is going to hire me, especially if I get brought up on criminal charges, which seems to be what Racine is aiming for. I'm broke. So this is pretty much the only gig I've got. I think now might be a good time to remind you we need to get the f*ck out of this town. Not yet. Come on, man. We came, we saw, we got our asses whupped. And if Rabbit is still out there, that's just one more reason to get gone. We risking our necks out here for chump change. We're still good. Still got those diamonds, right? f*ck me. Look, every day, you find a new way to get your damn head blown off and mine along with it. Those diamonds are an insurance policy for the both of us. I was keeping them safe. I know. I would never cut you out. I know. So let's get the f*ck out of here. We can fence the stones and set up shop in New York or anywhere else you want. Not yet. For f*ck's sake, what the hell is keeping you here, man? Here's how this works. You either give me your names so that I can call your parents or I have to involve the police. And I'm telling you it was a mistake. I meant to pay for them. And I'm sure your parents will believe you. I'm trying to cut you a break here by not calling the police. Call them. Okay. And as soon as they get here, I'll tell them how you groped me when you were taking us back here. Don't be ridiculous. [crying] He said he had to search me. And then... he started, like... rubbing my breasts. I was so scared. Deva. And you'll tell them it never happened. And I am sure your wife will believe you. So, William... can I call you William? What's it gonna be? Keep up the good work, William. Come on, Beats. Emmett : They knew what they were doing. Ever since they built that new connector, barely anyone uses that highway anymore. Least that much makes sense. So someone else ran them off the road and they left all the cash behind? Not all of it. Someone got away with one bag. 100,000 and change. Either the thieves or whoever ran them down. Yeah, but you got off light considering. Any idea who the shooter was? Can't help you there. This fake guard, you catch any security video  of him loading the truck this morning? The server went down this morning. So did our backup. Some kind of virus. We lost the last 24 hours of footage. Huh. And the missing cash, any way to trace that? Serial numbers? Markers? It's unbanked cash from the tables. Yesterday it was in someone's pocket. Yeah, I figured as much. George : There are some on the reservation who would consider $150,000 quite a bit. For a fortune, actually. It is troubling, Whether this was Proctor or not, the fact remains that the Kinaho Moon  is having some serious problems. George, we've been through this. This entire renovation and expansion was designed to be serviced by that hotel, which is now rubble. I take it your insurance didn't cover unexplained explosions. You've been opposed to the hotel project from the start. My father... Your father was a great man  who lost his way when he became ill. Even you have to concede that since you've become chief, our fortunes have suffered. And the tribe simply can't afford it. The sooner you say what you came to say, the sooner you can leave. You're out of your depth, Alex. And the members of the tribal council have serious concerns about your qualifications. You've always wanted this seat, George. Everybody knows that. And everybody knows that you're too young for it. Nola. [sighs] I know. Max : And they use special effects for it. But you can tell because his hair is barely moving. Right. And if he was really flying, his hair would be, like, you know, flying around his face and everything. Deva : Yeah, you are totally right. [coughing] Deva : You okay? Hey, where's your inhaler? I got it. Here. Here, bud. Deep breaths. You shouldn't be here. This is my home. Look, your case is going to the grand jury. I'm the district attorney. Are you really gonna let them charge me? Racine wants a scapegoat. I have no choice but to recuse myself. There's nothing I can do. The assistant district attorney... Bullshit. She works for you! I'm sorry. Are you innocent? Is that what you're telling me? I hurt you. I know that. No, Carrie. Not me, all of us. Max, Deva. And you didn't hurt us. You destroyed our family. You scarred your kids. And they will not heal. And sending their mother to prison, that's going to help? Well, their mother almost got them killed. I'm drowning here, Gordon. Yeah, well, join the f*cking club. Lucas : That's the last of it. Thanks. New beginnings. [both laugh] It's just temporary. I know. So, we're back in business. Yeah. Kind of hard to believe we got off so light, huh? Yeah, Racine's not interested in us. It's Rabbit he wants. You really think Gordon's gonna let Carrie go down for this? Racine's pulling all the strings. He's just playing every angle. Trying to flush out Rabbit. Can I ask you something? Off the record. Sure. You and Carrie Hopewell. What? I don't know. You tell me. There's nothing to tell. I got in over my head. That's all. So there's nothing between the two of you? No. I should probably go. Let you get settled. You've got secrets, boss. Don't we all? I'm just saying... if they ever get to be too much or if you want to talk... All right. What you did, coming to check up on me every day these past few weeks, that, uh... that was a big help. Good. I'm just glad you're back on your feet. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Gordon : It's hard to know what to say at a time like this. You know, Banshee's a town like any other town. And like any other town, we have our darkness. Our secrets. Danny was too young to be Mayor and he was definitely too young to die. But something in him compelled him to fight for goodness and justice. He was young enough or maybe naive enough to think that he could help to build us something better than we had, something better than maybe some of us deserved. He hadn't seen enough yet to know fear. Or regret. Or the relentless nature of evil. [clears throat] And the truth is, we should have had this service weeks ago, but Dan's the one who always arranged these kind of events. We're all just playing catch-up now, Janie, on behalf of myself, my office, and all of Banshee,  we mourn his loss with you. [music playing] Sugar : So, back to business as usual, huh? Yeah. Whatever that is. You know, Job may have a point. Do you ever stop to wonder if you be pushing your luck? Maybe it's time for you to take your show on the road. Look here, even at 20 cents on the dollar, those diamonds are more than enough to get you set up anywhere you choose. Trying to get rid of me? Yeah, maybe I am. For your own good. Come on, man. You've taken this sheriff thing about as far as it should have gone. Sooner or later, someone's gonna figure out who you are. Or at least who you are... not. The thing is... she's all I had. I leave here... I don't know, I feel like I'll disappear or something. You start over. It's what you do after a stretch like yours. Not that simple. Maybe. Maybe you just don't know simple when you see it. Nola : Seat taken? No, it's all yours. Sugar : Haven't seen you before. You from around here? I don't get out much. You got Chivas 25? Sure do. Rough day? I've had better. You live around here? Uh... about 40 yards away. Well, that's convenient. You wouldn't say that if you'd seen the place. Well, then let's go see the place.
