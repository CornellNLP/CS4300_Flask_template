 Siobhan :  Who the hell are you? Siobhan. Stay the f*ck away from me. You played us.  Me, Brock... Emmett? Everything about you is a lie. Siobhan, listen to me. Don't. Okay. Okay. Okay... Put the gun down. [cocks gun] It's me, Siobhan. No... You hear me? It's me. Come on. It's just me. There is no you. There is no you. [badge rattling] There is no you! [clicking] [theme music playing] 3x04 - "Real Life Is the Nightmare" [gasps] I need time to think. Just get out. We should talk about this. Get the f*ck out! Now! [beeps] Hey, good evening. Where's Mario and Frank? Oh, um, they had to do a double at Raymor Plaza. Some kind of plumbing leak. They're up to their eyeballs in sh1t, literally. [laughs] Yeah. Give me your badges. We already scanned them. And I'm gonna scan them again. Excuse my friend. He's a little slow since the accident. [beeps] What? Something wrong? Why'd you cut your hair, man? What? The 'fro. You know, just hanging around guys like this, it just felt too much like showing off. Thanks. Have a good night. Yeah, thank you. You, too. Okay. Big Brother's in the house. You seeing what I'm seeing? sh1t, they're watching them monitors like hawks. Then let's change the view. All right. Okay, you're clear. Go get that formula. It's an algorithm. Sugar :  Yeah, you say tomato. Sugar :  Hey, one of the guards is on the move. You better step on it. You need to step off it. I ain't watching f*cking YouTube videos up in here. Damn, he's getting on the elevator. Sh... [humming] Hey. Hey. Where's your partner? Oh, he went to take a leak. You know? [laughs] Sugar :  Look, you better step on it, man. Gonna get real crowded in there real soon. [beeps] Got you. Job. Job. Job. [beeps] [mutters] [chatter] Sorry I'm late. 45 minutes, Carrie. Her teacher couldn't wait. What did she say? Well, Deva's missing assignments, she's disruptive in class, and basically her attitude sucks. And apparently the school feels that our daughter is lacking any kind of discipline or structure at home. And that's my fault? I'm not pointing fingers. Well, you just did and this from a mayor who bangs hookers. Yeah, and like abandoning your family to go off to hunt down your gangster father is a lesson in family values? f*ck you, Gordon. Carrie, can you stop, please? Look, we need to do better. I realize that I have been blaming everybody else for my inability to handle everything that's happened. I just... it's our family. But you know that I have never been a victim in my life and I'm done with that. I want to figure this out for all of us. Where I come from, it's customary to drink to a job well done. Ha! Done? That algorithm was just the tip of this cluster f*ck. No, it's the small victories that keep you in the fight. I know you the Dalai Lama of Mayberry and all that , but that don't mean everything coming out your mouth is wisdom. It is far from party time. Fine. Cheers. Who'd you piss off this time? We may have to bail. What, on the job? On everything. Everything everything? How bad is it? Siobhan has the police file on me. Oh, f*ck. So why aren't we already doing 95 out of this shithole? Could be she won't turn me in. Let me explain something to you. There are fake cops... that's you... and there are real cops... that's her. Difference being real cops will turn your ass in. Maybe not. Would you please tell this man You two both do time what you gotta do.' run But I'm going to work, Job. Baby, I want you to try real hard to remember what happened the last time you rolled the dice on a woman. f*ck this. I'm packing. [chatter] [door opens] When were you gonna tell me? Brock. You're working for Proctor now, Emily? Have you lost it? How could you possibly know that? I called your agency. You did what? I didn't hear from you. Jesus Christ, Brock. I was worried about you. You're spying on me. I'm not spying on you. You're unbelievable. Do you have any idea how dangerous Proctor is? The kind of people that he deals with? d now you're living in the goddamn house? His mother is dying. Yeah, well, apparently she's not the only one. I was there the other day fishing a dead gangbanger out of his pool. Em, bad things happen there. I care for the dying. That's what I do. That's what I'm gonna keep on doing. Listen. Em, I'm begging you. Get as far away from that man as possible. The only one I need to get away from isou. Emily. That's very interesting. Just call me if anything changes. Tommy Littlestone's body has been cleared for release. I'm pretty sure his brother's eager to get him back to the reservation. I want to go, too. All right. Thank you, Ule. [video games chirping] My mother is driving me crazy. She's got a problem with everything I do. Any time you want to trade moms, just say the word. Sorry. Yeah, didn't think so. How is Max doing? Fine, I guess. Max has been wanting that game for months. $75 for a video game? What the hell? It's crazy. How's she doing? Resting comfortably. The new meds are doing a better job with the pain. That's good. Thank you for taking such good care of her. Well, it's what she deserves. It's what we all deserve. Yeah. How are you holding up, Mr. Proctor? Me? Well, I'm not the one who's dying. But you are suffering and you don't get any meds. The downside to being strong for everyone else is that you never get a moment for yourself. If you ever want to talk or... I've got nowhere else to be. Do you want to sit down? [music playing] [chatter] [bell dings] [dinging] Apple on three. [dings] Table six is ready to order. Table nine needs silverware. And the campers on 12 are asking for a third refill on coffee. [women laughing] [baby crying] [phone ringing] [laughing] [dings] [sizzling] A little help here. 12 is still asking for that refill. Carrie. What now? We wait. [sighs] Stay here. [doors open] [van doors close] Get in. [van engine starts] I've been practicing with my uncle. You're not an experienced driver. Well, then let's go get me some experience. What the hell? [engine revving] [engines revving] [tires squealing] [tires squealing] You called. What's going on? I'm withdrawing Proctor's plea bargain. I don't understand. We'll file the motion first thing in the morning. Sperling is gonna go apeshit on us. Well, that's just the gravy. By the way, I'm sorry I was a jerk. You weren't a jerk. You were an asshole. [chuckles] [labored breathing] [liquid splashing] [men screaming] [screaming] [phone ringing] I should probably go. Let you get settled. You've got secrets, boss. Don't we all? If they ever get to be too much or if you want to talk... [ringing continues] I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Hi, you've reached Siobhan Kelly. Please leave a message. [beeps] [beeps] [knocks] Hood. Yeah? I just got a call from fire and rescue. There's a wreck out on Highway 6. You handle it. Two DOAs, both Redbones. They were transporting Tommy Littlestone's body. Great, let's go. [music playing] ♪ Black or white ♪ 
♪ She's always the same ♪ 
♪ Lays in bed ♪ 
♪ Naked and unashamed... ♪ Tequila. Whatever you got. She'll have the Anejo, chilled. A real woman like you, I think that she deserves the best. You buying? Yes, ma'am. Make it a double. [chuckles] And keep 'em coming. [laughs] [radio chatter] I thought I was having a bad day. Lucas :  What do we got? Driver is Hakan Evans. He signed for the body at the morgue. We'll need dental records to identify the other. Any witnesses? Not out here. A second set of skid marks confirms another vehicle was involved. Could have been an accident. Yeah. You know this wasn't an accident. No? Chayton is gonna see this as a declaration of war. Yeah, well, that's Proctor's problem. Well, what are we gonna do about it? Nothing. What? We stay the f*ck out of it. Ah, it burns so good. You have a real pretty smile. Yeah, I still got it. Yes, ma'am. That's good. Is that your bike parked outside? Sexy beast, isn't she? Mmm. I used to dream about owning a machine like that. What do you mean used to? Another life. Well, that is a terribly sad story. But don't you worry 'cause your new buddy Scuyver, well, he's all about the happy endings. Is that right? That is right. I think that... maybe you and me should go somewhere more private. That sounds great, but, no. I gotta go. Maybe next time. What? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey. I got six drinks invested in this little party. So you ain't going nowhere till you show me a little gratitude. [thumping] [Scuyver cries out] When I say no, I mean it. 
 
 [phone ringing] Hi, you've reached Siobhan Kelly. Please leave a message. [beeps] [beeps] [phone ringing] Where are you? You should be asking where I'm not. Because in 20 minutes, the answer's gonna be Banshee, Pennsyl-fucking-vania. Give me until the end of the day and I'll come with you. Just gotta tie up a few loose ends. Well, then you tie them up quick, baby, and let's get the f*ck out of here. Hey. Hey, Deva. What? You aren't in school. I'm just running a little late. Well, maybe that's 'cause you're going the wrong way. Like you never ditched. I never got caught. [scoffs] Hey, Deva, I'm sorry about the other day. I'm over it, seriously. Look, I didn't mean to blow you off. Okay? I... You caught me off guard and everything came out wrong and I'm sorry. Well, it won't happen again, okay? From now on, you're just the asshole who knocked up my mom. Okay, fine, I'm the asshole. I mean, I've caused you nothing but problems since I got here, so I get it. Pretty much. [sighs] f*ck. Why do you even care? I just do. Why? [groans] Look, my old man never gave a sh1t about me. All right? I mean... I guess you could call him honest. But I f*cking hated him for it. I still do. I wish I didn't, but I do. I don't want you to hate me, Deva. But I can't make you do anything; no one can. That's a choice you gotta make on your own. You're leaving, aren't you? I have to. Does it matter that I want you to stay? Yes. It matters. Okay? But I made a huge f*cking mess, kid. And I have to go. Yeah. I don't hate you. Well, maybe a little bit. [laughs] I can live with that. What the f*ck are you doing? Hi, Jackson. We have an appointment? We had a goddamn deal. Yeah, well, our position has changed. You can't do this. It's already done. Proctor will have his day in court. You're making a big mistake, Gordon. Careful, Jackson, that almost sounded like a threat. It's a warning. I'm gonna come at you with everything I've got. Yeah, and what you've got is a guilty client. You should talk some sense into your boss. Your ass is on the line here, too. I appreciate your concern.

[alarm ringing] I feel trapped. I keep waking up from a dream to realize that it's real life that's become the nightmare. Then I do these stupid, dangerous things. I know that. It's just... I need to breathe. Well, I know how that feels. It's good to have you around. [sighs] Yeah. About that. What? What? [engine turns off] [distant dog barking] I know I'm being selfish, but I don't want you to go. Not now. Well, there's really no choice anymore, is there? Do you really think she'd arrest you? It doesn't really matter, does it? She knows. Where are you gonna go? I don't know. Anywhere. [chuckles] Right. Deva. She'll be okay. She's strong. Like her mom. And what about you? Are you gonna be okay? Of course. [engine starts] [door opens, closes] [footsteps] [knocks] Yeah? Hey. Hey. You look upset. Everything okay? It'll be all right. You know we have to talk about school. [sighs] Yeah. Not tonight, though. Get some sleep. Okay. Good night. Good night. You can get undressed now. [door closes] [sniffles] Are you leaving? You wanna take on the Redbones, go right ahead. I'm too old and too tired to be sticking my nose where it don't belong. We're the goddamn police, Karl. I'm going home. Don't call me unless the building's on fire. Brock's voice :  I still don't think you're much of a cop, but I think you're serious about getting Proctor. And this town's been waiting for somebody to do that for a long, long time. Kai's voice :  Sheriff, do you know why they're afraid of me? Lucas's voice :  Why is that? Kai's voice :  Because they should be. And maybe you should be, too. You have no evidence, no body, not even a name you say. Alison :  Would you put him away? Could you even put him away? A guilty verdict could mean five years in prison. Not acceptable. I... I will file every motion I can to slow the process down, but barring a miracle, your case is gonna be decided by a jury. [phone ringing] Then a miracle is exactly what you're gonna get me. You get it? Yeah? Kai, it's Emily. Your mother's taken a turn. You should come home now. She doesn't have much time. Kai :  Thank you, Emily. I'm on my way. You f*cking fix this. [tools buzzing] We're closed. Leave. Get out. What the hell are you doing? You need to leave now. Whatever it is, Sheriff, it has to wait. [gunshot] Rebecca :  No! [high-pitched tone] [gunshot] [gunshots] [high-pitched tone] Jesus. Call the police. Man :  Uh, he is the police. God damn it. [both grunting] [high-pitched tone] [groaning] [groans] [groans] [high-pitched tone] [saw buzzing] [choking] [cracks] [screams] [shouts] [groans] [high-pitched tone] Hood! [both panting] Come on. Get up. Get up. You okay? Kai Proctor, you're under arrest for assaulting an officer. Whoa, whoa. It was self-defense. Hood attacked him first. Back up or I'll cuff your ass, too. Go to your grandmother. She needs you. Yeah, let's go. [chanting] Alma :  Sorry for the wait. You can all head back now. The sheriff will need just a few minutes. [scoffs] Go. [chanting continues] May I help you? I would like to speak to the sheriff, please. Is he expecting you? No, ma'am. Take a seat. On second thought, go wait back there. Yes, ma'am. This is beyond harassment. I've got a dozen witnesses who will testify that you started the fight. Why don't you shut the f*ck up? What the hell happened? He tried to murder my client. I wasn't asking you. Do you have any idea how bad this looks? Ask me if I care. Hood. Stay! [chanting continues] What's up, farm boy? [chuckles] You three play nice. Hey, Hood. Yeah, don't worry. I got this. [guns cocking] I'm not gonna turn you in. Not because I don't want to,  but because the truth would annihilate this department. It would wipe away all the good work real cops have done around here. You know I tried to do good with that badge. That badge was never yours to wear. [whooping, shouting] Rabbit was your boss? You stole for him? Yes. And Carrie Hopewell, the two of you were... Yes. [scoffs] Jesus. [whooping, shouting] Why me? Siobhan, no matter what you think, you and me was not a lie. Siobhan, I swear to God. [whooping, shouting] The only time I ever felt safe was with you. I trusted you. I let you in. I know. You endangered my life, my career, and I let you. Siobhan. No. Don't f*ckin' touch me. This is what you're gonna do. You're gonna go out there right now, you're gonna finish booking Proctor, and then you're gonna quietly resign. Then what? And then you're gonna walk away. Get down! [gunfire] [windows shattering] [music playing] ♪ I'm red, I'm black, I'm city-born ♪
